00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,911
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to this
evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:08,931
of us nerdy-ass voice actors, some of us far from
our place on the Internet, sit around and play

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:15,600
Dungeons &amp; Dragons, throw some dice, and all that
insanity. So, welcome to the chaos. Let's see,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,005
first and foremost, let's go ahead and get some
announcements out of the way so we can hop into

5
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:26,115
the game proper. Sam is on his way, per usual.
Liam is here via Internet.

6
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,777
LAURA: Can you see him, is he there?

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,708
MATT: There we go, there's our Liam.

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:30,977
TALIESIN: Digital Liam.

9
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:32,335
LAURA: My brother.

10
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:33,383
LIAM: What?

11
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,218
LAURA: I can't see you, you're hiding in the
shadows.

12
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,287
LIAM: Can you hear me?

13
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,346
LAURA: I can, yes.

14
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,919
MATT: Wonders of the Internet.

15
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,853
LIAM: I'm in the Bag of Holding.

16
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:47,574
MATT: That's not going to end well for you, if
oxen have shown us anything. Yeah, poor Dork.

17
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,329
Always remember Dork.

18
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,836
TRAVIS: Never forget.

19
00:00:50,836 --> 00:01:00,042
MATT: That's another shirt. Have a seat. Hello!

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:04,372
LIAM: I can see you guys on Twitch! Did you know
you're on the Internet?

21
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:06,338
LAURA: What? You're crazy!

22
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,665
MARISHA: Someone's watching?

23
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:08,988
TRAVIS: Don't make it weird, man.

24
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:13,669
MATT: Don't make it weird, Liam. All right, let's
go ahead and plug through these announcements so

25
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:14,879
we can get into the game.

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,933
LAURA: Yes, yes.

27
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,610
MATT: First thing, me and Marisha wanted to reach
out and let everyone know that we're going to be

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:28,464
guests next weekend, I believe it's
the 8th through the 10th, at an event called

29
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,845
Tekko. Tekko in Pittsburgh. It's an awesome
convention, we're going to be doing panels

30
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:36,072
and signings, all that fun stuff. So if any of you
are in that area, you should come hang out at

31
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:38,258
Tekko with us, in a week. That would be awesome.

32
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:39,593
MARISHA: My old stomping grounds.

33
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:40,609
MATT: There you go.

34
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,501
MARISHA: College days, yeah.

35
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:47,000
TRAVIS: Aw, sad Affleck.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,659
MATT: Sad Affleck, best game ever. Watched it over
and over again. All right, so. Today, guys, is the

37
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,960
last day to pre-order your Gilmore's Glorious
Goods shirts. We've had them up for a week. There's

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,679
a delightful presentation by our lovely Liam. You
should pick one up. I should pick one up. I don't

39
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,741
have one myself, yet. Yeah, go ahead and preorder
a copy. We're trying out this new process to get

40
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,217
shirts out to everyone, so get that one before
they're gone.

41
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:18,658
TRAVIS: It's actually tomorrow.

42
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:19,529
MATT: Tomorrow.

43
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,764
TRAVIS: Tomorrow at midnight is the deadline.

44
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:23,931
MATT: So would that be like midnight tonight,
or--?

45
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:25,880
LAURA: See, that's exactly what I was asking
Travis.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,736
TRAVIS: You smart son of a bitches. It's so
simple. Tomorrow at midnight.

47
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:31,721
LAURA: Is like in a few hours.

48
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,007
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Oh my god.

49
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:38,929
TALIESIN: 12:01 is the start of the next day. 
Midnight is still today.

50
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,268
LAURA: Oh, really?

51
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,536
TALIESIN: Sure. I could be wrong.

52
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,402
MARISHA: It's 12:00 am.

53
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:48,737
LAURA: Is it ending tomorrow night, or is it
ending tonight?

54
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:49,981
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

55
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:52,262
MATT: I don't know. You should order tonight, just
in case!

56
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:56,014
LAURA: I'm scared it's actually ending tonight. He
thinks it's tomorrow night, but I think it might

57
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:57,136
be tonight.

58
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,331
MATT: To be safe, make it tonight, but it's
probably tomorrow night.

59
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,467
LAURA: It's probably tomorrow night.

60
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,742
MATT: But to be safe, make it tonight.

61
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:04,187
LAURA: He's going to murder us all, very shortly.

62
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:09,743
MATT: Save it for the battle. Save it for the
battle, Travis. Also, is it already up in the

63
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:10,892
store now?

64
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:13,008
TRAVIS: Yes, 6:30 today, it went up.

65
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:17,765
MATT: All right, we have two new shirts. Two new
shirts available for pre-order, guys.

66
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:21,051
LAURA: All these overlapping things
happening?

67
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:22,691
TALIESIN: These two new shirts.

68
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,458
SAM: Whoa, what's that say?

69
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,115
MATT: Dagger, dagger, dagger.

70
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,555
SAM: Dagger, dagger-- jagger? Why would it say
jagger?

71
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:29,492
TALIESIN: In honor of Mick Jagger.

72
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:30,775
SAM: Oh, okay.

73
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:35,704
LAURA: And we've got our Critical Role logo 
on the back. So cool.

74
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,214
MARISHA: So you know it's official.

75
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:38,948
TRAVIS: I really like these ones.

76
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:42,565
LAURA: They're soft, they feel very nice on your
body.

77
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,627
MARISHA: They do.

78
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:50,571
LAURA: But yeah, those will be up as well for a
week for pre-order, so yeah, check those out. Get

79
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:56,736
whatever shirts you can. And I think there's a
limited amount available for purchase right away,

80
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:04,210
so if you order fast, you might be able to get
them. But that's a very small amount. And also, to

81
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,231
everybody that's been messaging us on Twitter,
there have been some people that have really been

82
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:13,549
wanting us to expand our sizing and we are
definitely working on that. It's hard to find some

83
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:19,904
vendors that can accommodate us, but we're working
on it, so hopefully moving forward in the future,

84
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:22,114
we'll have larger sizes available to everyone.

85
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:29,079
MATT: Yeah, we're really, really trying to do
that. Soon. Soon, we'll have announcements. Great,

86
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,103
so there is also-- let's see, Sam, you had an
announcement about a cartoon?

87
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:43,689
SAM: Oh, oh yes. I've been voice directing this
cartoon called Home, based on the movie Home with

88
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:50,466
Dreamworks and they just announced today that it
exists. So it's coming out in a week, and it's

89
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,884
going to be really good. It's a really fun show.
Zaniness.

90
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:55,405
TALIESIN: Kooky zany.

91
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,602
SAM: Kooky zany. Kooky zany. Big, bright colors.

92
00:04:57,602 --> 00:05:04,085
MATT: Fantastic. Also, tonight is our 47th
episode, we are three episodes away from our big

93
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:11,563
50th episode. It'll be a regular episode of this,
depending on where the story is at the time, but

94
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:17,505
it'll be special because it's our 50th. Also,
we'll have a couple surprises and we'll be doing

95
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:26,223
our big Critmas blowout right after the 50th
episode. Then we'll be putting to rest until the

96
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:31,219
holidays come around, but yeah, look forward to
that 50th episode when it hits, guys. So make sure

97
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:35,858
you don't miss it. Mark off your calendar. I
already did. But I have to. Every week. So I don't

98
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:41,969
have a choice, but you do, and you should come.
Anybody else have any other announcements they want to

99
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,105
make?

100
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:48,997
LIAM: Oh my gosh, Laura, hold up my boxes. Do you
have items that need to be put inside boxes when

101
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:53,783
you're not holding dice? Because Wyrmwood Gaming
makes boxes for your dice and if you use the code

102
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:54,783
"critrole"--

103
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:56,602
LAURA: Critrole! Critrole!

104
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:58,760
LIAM: You can get free shipping.

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,127
MATT: (laughs) It never makes me not laugh.

106
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:08,315
LAURA: By the way, I have some of Liam's dice in
front of me.

107
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,856
MARISHA: Oh, snap.

108
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:12,382
LAURA: Maybe my brother should hang onto his
things.

109
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:15,024
LIAM: Don't infect my dice!

110
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:18,488
MATT: Cool, anything else, guys? We good?

111
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:24,557
MARISHA: My last episode of Signal Boost is this
Tuesday.

112
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,345
SAM: What do you mean last? You just started!

113
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,925
MARISHA: Yeah, we rotate hosts out.

114
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:28,796
SAM: Oh.

115
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,664
MARISHA: Because it's like our favorite things and
I don't want to have to--

116
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:31,873
SAM: But you're the best host.

117
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,001
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, Sam.

118
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,257
TALIESIN: Of all the hosts they've had, she
certainly was the best one.

119
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,647
SAM: Yes, she's number one.

120
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,681
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm glad my friends support
me.

121
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,664
MATT: It's still your show, you still produce it.

122
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:46,793
MARISHA: Yes, yeah. I'm not letting it go. I'm
still producing it.

123
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:49,326
SAM: Just tell me, am I one of the hosts?

124
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,723
MARISHA: Do you want to host?

125
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:56,059
SAM: Just tell me when, and I will be probably be
20 minutes late.

126
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,183
MARISHA: Okay, I'll make that work.

127
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:01,866
TRAVIS: That's what these pre-show announcements are,
is trailers for those that are late to the stream,

128
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,006
they don't miss anything. But, see, Batman vs.
Superman, no trailers. Scared the shit out of me.

129
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,320
You can't do that to somebody. That's half of the
joy of going to the movies.

130
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:18,477
MATT: What? Yeah. That's half the joy gone and
then you have the movie. Sorry. Anyway, so--

131
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:23,797
LIAM: Oh wait, I got one last thing, it's not
really a professional announcement, but I am

132
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:29,186
sitting in the kitchen that I grew up in. I'm
playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the first room that

133
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:31,920
I ever played Dungeons &amp; Dragons in.

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,063
MATT: That's awesome.

135
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:36,433
LAURA: That's a wonderful announcement.

136
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:48,505
MATT: Fantastic. Well, cool, guys, then let's go
ahead and get this show on the road. So, last we

137
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:54,756
left off, Vox Machina, having to traverse the
world in search of artifacts known as the Vestiges

138
00:07:54,756 --> 00:08:01,246
of Divergence, ancient items of power used in
massive-scale warfare in ancient moments of

139
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:07,218
history, they had acquired one from a sunken
temple of the Champion of the Raven Queen, taking

140
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:13,076
the life, and thankfully not permanently, of
Vex'ahlia over here. The party then retrieved

141
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:18,846
their first artifact and made their way towards
the Pyrah tribe of the Ashari druids, the Fire

142
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:25,250
Guardians of the Gate to the Elemental Plane of
Fire, which apparently Thordak, the Cinder King,

143
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,704
the great red dragon that helms the Chroma
Conclave that just tore through all of the

144
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,304
civilization of Tal'Dorei, emerged from.

145
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,491
MARISHA: "Apparently."

146
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:41,582
MATT: "Apparently." By that I mean, confirmed,
universally, tore through. You guys went there,

147
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:49,057
found a surviving faction of the Pyrah tribe,
including Cerkonos, their Headmaster, as well as a

148
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:56,784
few members of your tribe, the Air Ashari,
Keyleth. And your father. You went towards the

149
00:08:56,784 --> 00:09:04,701
remnants of the Cindergrove, ran into an ally, a
strange blue-scaled dragonborn by the name of Gern

150
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:12,897
Blanston, master of necromancy and candle-making
and combining the two for interesting effect. You

151
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:23,021
fought your way through the Cindergrove, tearing
through elementals, encasing efreets in hamster

152
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:29,077
balls and holding them aloft for extended periods
of time. Worked out well. And then managed to seal

153
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:34,710
the Gate with the help of the druidic tribes
there, Gern, and the intrepid adventurers of Vox

154
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:40,562
Machina. After which, you went to spend the evening
there on the mountainside to rest before

155
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:49,119
continuing your journey to wherever that next step
may be. So the rest of you are beaten, bruised,

156
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:54,030
and winded over the previous series of battles and
the accomplishment you achieved here at the top

157
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:00,189
of the caldera of this mountain. The erupting,
seismic energies and molten rock that once spewed

158
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:06,285
from the center of this rift have calmed, and the
gate once again has been sealed to its dormant,

159
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:12,774
controllable, and watchable size. You guys are
free to make camp wherever you'd like.

160
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:15,629
LAURA: We already rested, though?

161
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:20,953
MATT: Not yet, you're about to set up rest. There
are sections, as you're walking out of the

162
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:27,091
Cindergrove, that you can see members of the Pyrah
tribe are pulling up still-functional pieces of

163
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:33,396
huts and tents and things that were destroyed when
Thordak tore through the rift, and they're

164
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:37,911
beginning to reassemble a place to stay for the
evening for themselves, so if you wish to stay

165
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:41,982
among the Pyrah tribe for the evening, it seems to
be at least a relatively safe bet.

166
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:46,502
LAURA: What do you think, Keyleth? I mean, it's
your family.

167
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:54,082
MARISHA: That's up to you guys. I don't think I
can transport us out of here until we sleep.

168
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:57,150
TALIESIN: I have no problem sleeping here this
evening.

169
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,079
LAURA: I'm rather winded, actually.

170
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,031
TALIESIN: Yes.

171
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,600
TRAVIS: What are all the tents and houses made of,
anyway?

172
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,118
MATT: Most of them are made of pieces of stone.
The actual blackened grey rock of this mountain,

173
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:15,847
elements of it have been fused together with bits
of glass to forge these thick, very sturdy walls

174
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:19,219
when they aren't being torn through by a colossal
red dragon.

175
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,563
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Whatever.

176
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:25,121
MATT: So they're being brought back up, druids are
using what remains of their powers from the fight

177
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:32,274
today to assemble more walls of stone, and they're
basically creating ramshackle living spaces using

178
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,826
their magic.

179
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,560
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and assist them,
because I didn't use any 5th-level spells.

180
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,683
MATT: All right. So you begin throwing up some
stone walls to help build a small shelter for the

181
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,803
evening. The rest--

182
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,551
LAURA: Is Gern completely out of the picture, have
we lost sight of him?

183
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:53,457
MATT: You've lost sight of Gern, Gern went back
into the Cindergrove and began essentially

184
00:11:53,457 --> 00:12:00,679
gutter-sniping what pieces of red dragon scales he
could locate in the vicinity. He has not been seen

185
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,096
since that moment. Who knows to where he wandered?

186
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,862
SAM: Key-leth? If I may.

187
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,251
MARISHA: Yes, Scan-lan?

188
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,717
LAURA: You said that so weird.

189
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,510
SAM: That's how it's spelled: Key-leth.

190
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,189
MARISHA: So regal of you, Scan-lan.

191
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:20,061
SAM: Are your people comfortable in these little
huts and stuff, are we going to be safe tonight?

192
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:23,557
Because I could assist us with slightly better
shelter.

193
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:25,764
LAURA: Like how, what do you mean?

194
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:29,024
SAM: With my magical... dalliances.

195
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,494
TRAVIS: Is that another name for your penis?

196
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,204
SAM: It is.

197
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,876
LAURA: Are you going to poop us a bed?

198
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:42,126
SAM: I could poop us a bed. Are we okay here,
safely, or should I get us something special?

199
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,478
TALIESIN: With your dalliance.

200
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:44,647
SAM: With my dalliance.

201
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:47,560
TALIESIN: I think your penis may have more names
than I do, I'm kind of horrified.

202
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,933
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want a house from your balls and
bits.

203
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:55,573
MARISHA: I mean, my people have lived here for
thousands of years.

204
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:58,372
SAM: Yes, but their shelters are destroyed now,
so.

205
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:02,010
MARISHA: Sure, I mean, generally we're safe as
long as dragons aren't smashing through the

206
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,120
village, but I mean, if you have an alternative.

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,784
SAM: I have an alternative. I could do a bit of
dalliancing.

208
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:15,023
MARISHA: You know, you've talked about it so much
now, Scanlan.

209
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,886
TALIESIN: Is this going to be
self-dalliance or are you going to need a partner

210
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,864
or two?

211
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,739
LAURA: I know, are we just going to watch you
diddle yourself? Let's have it.

212
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,352
TRAVIS: Mushroom-stamp the land, let's go.

213
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:29,496
SAM: No, no, so I will take a minute and cast
Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.

214
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:33,158
TALIESIN: I am so proud of you. I am so proud of
you.

215
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:37,304
MATT: Okay, so you guys watch as Scanlan rummages
through some of his side pouches and belongings,

216
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:44,577
pulls out a few elements, a small doorway carved
from ivory. He pulls out a piece of polished

217
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:49,764
marble, a tiny silver spoon, and puts them on the
ground in front of him, closes his eyes for a

218
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:50,815
second--

219
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:54,355
SAM: Can I enchant it with a little song or
something?

220
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,646
MATT: Yes you may.

221
00:13:55,646 --> 00:14:04,290
SAM: So I'll sing (singing) It's a sick house,
it's mighty mighty, it's letting it all hang--

222
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,369
that's it.

223
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:10,038
MATT: You guys are mildly confused, but as he
picks up the items, you can see the door sets off

224
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:16,186
this small spark of white energy that glistens in
the air, hovers, and then creates a somewhat

225
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:20,490
shimmering doorway, just standing in the center of
the space in front of you.

226
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,821
LAURA: What?

227
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:31,465
SAM: Would you like to come into my place? It's a
little modest shack that I've been working on.

228
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:33,340
LAURA: Is this a teleport sort of--

229
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,359
TRAVIS: It's a door.

230
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,437
MARISHA: Is this a joke?

231
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,253
TALIESIN: There's nothing on the other side of it,
is there?

232
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:43,263
SAM: No, no, it's a place where we can rest for
the evening, totally safe and comfortable. It's on

233
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:48,276
a slightly different plane from ours, so nothing
can actually hurt us there or get to us.

234
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:54,320
LAURA: Is it that fire plane where we just--
there's no dragons in that plane?

235
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,696
SAM: I haven't checked in a while. Actually, this
is my first time doing this.

236
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:05,623
TRAVIS: We should send somebody ahead first to
check. Vax, are you up to the bit?

237
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:08,745
LIAM: Am I up to what? What was that, Grog?

238
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:11,296
SAM: It's totally safe, don't worry, don't worry.

239
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:15,094
LIAM: As long as you're not going to whip out the
cube, then lead the way.

240
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:19,354
SAM: How many people can fit in there? It's pretty
big.

241
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:26,283
MATT: Any creature you designate when you cast the
spell to enter. So you could say the entire Pyrah

242
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:27,585
tribe if you wanted.

243
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:28,461
LAURA: What?

244
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,498
SAM: Everybody.

245
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:30,907
MATT: Everybody in the group, or the Pyrah?

246
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,346
SAM: How many are there?

247
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:36,422
MATT: Here, there's close to 35, including the
Zephrah.

248
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:42,090
LAURA: Wait, could you technically do this with
any refugees? I mean, where do they go when you

249
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:43,754
make the door go away?

250
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:50,865
SAM: This is my place, all right? I don't want any
riffraff in there. Listen, there's a guest list,

251
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,688
there's a guy at the door--

252
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:56,536
TALIESIN: I can solve this really quickly. Are any
of the Pyrah tribe hot?

253
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,713
LAURA: Like, attractive?

254
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:00,917
TALIESIN: Attractive.

255
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,118
LAURA: They're all hot.

256
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:09,760
MATT: Through the soot and ash and the rather
somber atmosphere here that paints them as a

257
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:14,267
people that are the survivors of a horrible
calamity, beyond that, there's probably a few that

258
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,353
you'd consider attractive, sure, if you're that
kind of person.

259
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,482
TALIESIN: That one over there was looking at you,
I saw her wink at you earlier.

260
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:19,462
SAM: Oh, really?

261
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,388
TALIESIN: You should impress her.

262
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,478
SAM: The one with her face just sheared off?

263
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:23,710
TALIESIN: Yeah, why not?

264
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:32,051
SAM: All right. Not really my type. I like
full-faced people, but I'll take it, I'll take my

265
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,277
chance.

266
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,655
TALIESIN: I think that's big of you.

267
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:35,771
LAURA: So terrible.

268
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:39,950
SAM: You know, if there's anyone from your
immediate family that you'd like to give lodging

269
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,201
to tonight-- okay, we'll take them all, we'll take
them all in. We'll take them all in.

270
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:47,987
MARISHA: Sure. Do you want to tell them? It is
your humble abode.

271
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,262
SAM: Ashari people!

272
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:50,494
MARISHA: All right.

273
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:53,963
MATT: You see some of them stop and drop the rocks
they're currently holding and building some of

274
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:55,231
these small shelters.

275
00:16:55,231 --> 00:17:00,440
SAM: Don't worry about your shelter for tonight.
Let Scanlan Shorthalt take care of you, in every

276
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,814
way, shape, and form imaginable. Come with me
through this weird magic door into another plane.

277
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:09,753
Believe me, it's going to be okay.

278
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:15,967
MATT: They all look at each other with a strange
glance and continue building their current

279
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:16,949
shelters.

280
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,668
LAURA: Why the fuck not? And I walk on through.

281
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:23,337
MATT: Okay. You open the door, and as you grab it,
it is a solid door, and the handle spins, you look

282
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:33,682
inside, and within you see an incredibly lush
foyer to a grand mansion, a 25-, 30-foot ceiling

283
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:39,048
made of marble and dark woods, you see a two-part
staircase that splits off onto a second-tier

284
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:44,152
floor, you hear soft music playing in the
distance, and immediately you see two somewhat

285
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:48,783
ethereal servants come down, dressed as a butler
and a maid, they come down, with an echoing voice

286
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,306
that say, "How might we be of service?"

287
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,713
LAURA: What the fuck.

288
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:58,799
SAM: Hi. I step in after her. Yes, I've made some
changes to the place. Living quarters are

289
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,505
upstairs, there's a kitchen, parlor, game room
over there, billiards, all sorts of stuff. We have

290
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:11,432
a music room. There are a hundred attendants who
can wait on us. I've assigned some of them

291
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:16,906
specific jobs. Five are going to play music for us
wherever we want, especially during our meals.

292
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,324
MATT: "Let me take your things, Master."

293
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:20,523
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, here.

294
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:24,923
TRAVIS: I come inside and I see the ethereal
things, I'm like, ghosts! And I take Craven Edge

295
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:27,546
and I swing at the ethereal sumbitch!

296
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:34,502
SAM: Are you attacking my attendants?

297
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:36,757
TRAVIS: No, the ghosts in your house!

298
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,538
SAM: They're my people!

299
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:39,397
TRAVIS: What?

300
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,336
MATT: By the time you go to stop him, three of the
servants that have grabbed a few of your

301
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:47,025
belongings and been carrying away, are swung at,
Craven Edge passing through, and their energy

302
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,054
dispersing, and their contents of whatever they're
carrying drop and clink to the ground.

303
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,103
LAURA: No!

304
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,487
SAM: Jesus Christ--

305
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,536
TRAVIS: Thank god I'm here.

306
00:18:54,536 --> 00:19:00,207
SAM: Grog, Grog, easy. Easy. They're not ghosts,
they're not ghosts. They are supernatural

307
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:07,872
spirits-- some would say ghosts-- that are good,
they serve us, they serve me--

308
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:10,791
LAURA: Wait, do you pay them or do they just work for
you?

309
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,971
SAM: They're slave ghosts.

310
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:15,280
LAURA: This is terrible. Scanlan!

311
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,441
SAM: Well, no, they like it for some reason.

312
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,354
LAURA: Are you sure?

313
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,014
SAM: I can command them to do literally anything
and they like it.

314
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:22,039
LAURA: Have you asked them?

315
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,758
SAM: Watch this. Watch this. I call one over. You
there, you there.

316
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:31,276
MATT: This maid comes over, a plumper older woman,
no feet, just drifting along with this path of

317
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:34,087
mist behind her. "Yes, Master?"

318
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:35,874
SAM: Can you please braid my chest hair?

319
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,779
MATT: "But of course, Master."

320
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,466
SAM: Do you like this job?

321
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,755
MATT: "It is my purpose, Master."

322
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,511
SAM: See? This is what I'm telling you.

323
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:45,657
LAURA: Your purpose, do you enjoy your purpose?

324
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:50,367
MATT: "What does one but enjoy their purpose in
life?" And continues braiding his chest hair,

325
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:54,319
these tiny little hairs, doing a very good job.
It's not very long, but sure enough, there is a

326
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,530
pattern.

327
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,338
LAURA: Wow.

328
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,658
SAM: Thank you, you're dismissed. Back to the
music room.

329
00:19:58,658 --> 00:19:59,871
MATT: "Of course, Master."

330
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,977
LAURA: Do you tip them?

331
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,441
SAM: You can tip me, I'll pass it out later.

332
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:03,710
LAURA: I believe you.

333
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,466
TRAVIS: Hey, you there, you, ghostie, do you have
any ale in this establishment?

334
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:12,667
MATT: "But of course, sir. We have an entire winery
as part of the mansion."

335
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:16,549
LAURA: What in the fuck is this place? How are you
doing this?

336
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,918
TRAVIS: Bring your most expensive frosty glass of
ale.

337
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,635
MATT: "All right."

338
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,350
LIAM: I pull Scanlan over to the
side. Have you always been able to do this? Have

339
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,415
you been holding out on us, man?

340
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,566
SAM: It never occurred to me to do this before,
for some reason.

341
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:33,055
TRAVIS: You shouldn't be Burt Reynolds, you should
be Hugh Hefner from now on.

342
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:41,248
SAM: No, this is a skill that I recently acquired.
I would not hold out on you. This is a new skill

343
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:46,789
that I've just learned, and I'm still making
improvements to the house. You'll see that our

344
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:54,866
dining room has a portrait of myself in it. Not
the one that I had commissioned, but one that I

345
00:20:54,866 --> 00:21:02,253
had envisioned before. It's just me in a smoking
jacket standing in front of a fireplace with me in

346
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,966
a smoking jacket above it, Stephen Colbert-style.

347
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,184
TRAVIS: Really?

348
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:15,575
SAM: And we all have our own separate rooms. All
of the beds are circular, they all have a mirror

349
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,602
over them.

350
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:19,780
TRAVIS: Oh my god. It's Graceland!

351
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,772
SAM: Mine is a waterbed, so be careful.

352
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:28,132
LAURA: So wait, you built this entire castle, so
how do we know that you haven't installed creepy

353
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:30,678
spy things into our rooms, Scanlan?

354
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:31,992
MARISHA: Yeah, little peep holes.

355
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:32,846
LAURA: I don't trust you.

356
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:35,404
SAM: On we go to the rest of it!

357
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:37,026
TRAVIS: I'm waiting on my beer.

358
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:40,650
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. Let's get some
beer, let's take a rest, and in the morning we can

359
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,340
go to the game room, get some dice and some
paper--

360
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,924
TRAVIS: A game within a game. The Inception (bass
note).

361
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:53,439
TALIESIN: It's called Meta and Dragons, we're just
going to see how deep it goes.

362
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,964
MARISHA: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed for no
reason. She's not sure why.

363
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,779
TALIESIN: Had to get that out of my system.

364
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,521
MATT: An ever-spinning top on the banister. At
this point, Grog, you can see that the servant you

365
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:08,345
had sent off comes up with a very large, somewhat
spectral flagon, that upon handing it to you,

366
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,635
turns into a solid metallic form, and inside--

367
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,705
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

368
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:15,776
MATT: -- a very, very finely chilled, very
nice-smelling wine.

369
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:17,367
TRAVIS: I put my hand up for a high-five.

370
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,511
MATT: It makes contact.

371
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:20,460
TRAVIS: It does?

372
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,607
MATT: A little cushy, but it does make contact,
yes.

373
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,597
TRAVIS: Wait, these servants will do whatever you
want to do?

374
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:30,811
LAURA: That is terrible, it's a terrible path
you're going down right now, I am uncomfortable

375
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:31,510
with this--

376
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:37,027
SAM: I am way ahead of you, Grog. I'm way ahead of
you. As I said, there are 100 servants here. 50 of

377
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:43,850
them are assigned to me and my own personal
service. The rest are available to you in whatever

378
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,405
capacity you'd like them.

379
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,805
TRAVIS: This is going to be the best night ever.

380
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,984
MARISHA: Let me go try and gather the rest of the
Ashari.

381
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:53,435
LAURA: So uncomfortable right now.

382
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:58,610
MARISHA: Can I get a plate of food from one of the
ghosts as proof?

383
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,874
TRAVIS: It's about to get Caligula up in this
bitch.

384
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:07,991
MATT: The servants gather up a platter of food,
piling up, grapes and meats and cured ham.

385
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:11,971
MARISHA: I just pop out of the door and address
the people.

386
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:15,776
MATT: As soon as you pop out of the door, it all
turns to smoke and dissipates.

387
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:30,098
MARISHA: Aw, son of a-- Hey, guys, hey. It's okay.
It's actually really nice. It's been rough, why

388
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:35,124
don't we all take a night off and everyone come in
and get some food. Take a night off.

389
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,114
LAURA: Scanlan, where are we staying? Where's our
rooms?

390
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:42,233
SAM: Rooms are all upstairs. There's individual
rooms for all of us. Mine is at the end of the

391
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:50,503
hallway, and is slightly bigger than the rest.
You will find comfortable beds and things in every

392
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:55,772
room. The two rooms next to mine are reserved--

393
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:57,292
LAURA: For?

394
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:02,622
SAM: One is for Pike, the other across the hallway
is for Kaylie, just in case she ever drops by.

395
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:03,849
LAURA: That's really sweet.

396
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,520
TALIESIN: Weird, but sweet.

397
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,821
SAM: Don't worry, it's not weird.

398
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,113
TALIESIN: Oh, it's weird.

399
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,219
SAM: Keeping her close to my heart.

400
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,838
LAURA: It's super-duper weird. It's really weird.

401
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:18,518
SAM: It's not super-duper-- fine, fine, forget it.
When you have a daughter, you can worry about her

402
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,412
as much as I do.

403
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:25,472
MATT: At this point, Keyleth returns with a few
straggler Pyrah tribal members that come in,

404
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:31,090
looking about, surprised, bewildered, and some of
them a little freaked out by this transdimensional

405
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,809
space they just stepped into, TARDIS-style.
Servants come up and start helping them. Some of

406
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,880
them are still clutching the rocks they were
building as they pass it off and start making

407
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,335
their way out to various rooms to inspect the
mansion. A few stay back to continue what they

408
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:51,456
were already building, ensuring future
establishments to sleep once you guys have left.

409
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,307
So yeah, you guys are welcome to rest for the
evening, if you'd like.

410
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:58,411
LAURA: Is the door protected? Can anybody come in,
or is it only if you invite them?

411
00:24:58,411 --> 00:24:59,798
SAM: Only invited.

412
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:04,728
LAURA: This is the best fucking mansion ever.
How-- I mean-- what?

413
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:06,735
TRAVIS: How many times can you do this?

414
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:09,890
SAM: Once a day, but that's all we'll need,
right?

415
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:16,557
TRAVIS: Shit, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, so if we
were in a fight and things went really south--

416
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,176
SAM: We could take a break.

417
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:21,128
LAURA: (gasps) No, but they could run away, it's
not like time freezes.

418
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,501
SAM: It does take a while to cast.

419
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,850
MATT: It takes a minute, so yeah.

420
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,901
SAM: It takes a minute to cast.

421
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,421
MARISHA: So it can't be the middle of a battle,
sure.

422
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:30,974
LIAM: Is there anything else you can do that you
haven't-- can you make an army of unicorns or a

423
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:35,294
giant in a dancing dress, or is this the extent of
what you can do?

424
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:38,555
SAM: I'd like to keep a few secrets, if you don't
mind.

425
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:40,566
TRAVIS: Can you make fart sounds with your
armpits?

426
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:43,407
SAM: Yes. I can bend my thumb all the way back.

427
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:52,669
LAURA: I pull out my crystal and I call upon the
great power of Trinket. I choose you.

428
00:25:52,669 --> 00:26:02,014
MATT: With a flash of deep blue and black light,
Trinket emerges (bear noises).

429
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:05,658
LAURA: We have a mansion! You built a Trinket
room.

430
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:09,258
SAM: You know what, I totally forgot to build
Trinket a place to sleep.

431
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:12,378
LAURA: That's okay, he'll stay in Kaylie's room
for the time being, and then--

432
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:14,066
SAM: No no, Kaylie's room is locked.

433
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:17,798
LAURA: Pike loves him, I bet he wouldn't mind--

434
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:24,003
SAM: Let me just think about this for a second.
There's the third pantry. The third pantry could

435
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:30,239
possibly work. It has some just mostly-- no, no,
it's full, we can't use that.

436
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,556
LAURA: Do you have any rooms with very high
ceilings?

437
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:34,979
SAM: The front.

438
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,912
LAURA: The very front?

439
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,591
SAM: The front hall.

440
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:42,848
LAURA: But I mean somewhere I could put a bed for
myself and Trinket with very high ceilings.

441
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:48,591
SAM: All right, yes, there's a whole basement
area. It's a large space.

442
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,474
LAURA: Wonderful. I'll move my bed down there.

443
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:53,375
SAM: It's for training and working with weapons.

444
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,082
LAURA: That'll be perfect. Trinket needs to
train.

445
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:57,596
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go down there and I'll stay
with Trinket.

446
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:59,709
LAURA: All right.

447
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:04,507
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to train a little, want to
work out a bit.

448
00:27:04,507 --> 00:27:06,527
LAURA: Totally. I understand.

449
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:13,291
TRAVIS: Yep. I need a target, though. Hey, can you
call one of those little ghostly guys over?

450
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,671
SAM: You can have five of them.

451
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:22,270
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, fine. The first one of you
that brings me a cow wins.

452
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:30,169
MATT: They all look at each other. "Right away,
sir." And all five of them drift off. A moment

453
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:32,165
later, they all return with a spectral cow.

454
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:35,009
MARISHA: Like five cows, they each return with
one?

455
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,665
MATT: No, each one of them is just traveling with
one cow, they've all brought you together one

456
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:40,604
spectral cow.

457
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:45,018
TRAVIS: It's like a bunch of Mr. Meeseeks with
cows. Do I get to pick a cow? There's just one cow?

458
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:46,368
MATT: There's just one cow.

459
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:48,359
TRAVIS: Right. So can I touch the cow on the
head?

460
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,676
MATT: You touch it, and it has weight to it, it
has surface area.

461
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:55,301
LAURA: No, we're killing cows, we're killing,
we're killing poor servants--

462
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,525
TRAVIS: We're not killing anything! And I punch
the cow in the nose.

463
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,015
SAM: Jesus!

464
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:02,681
LAURA: That's so dark!

465
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,484
TRAVIS: No, look, I'm just seeing what it is.
Stay, Bessie.

466
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,055
MARISHA: Grog, you just punched a cow in the
face.

467
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,876
TRAVIS: What, I'm just seeing if it bled. Did the
nose bleed?

468
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:12,858
MATT: There is no blood.

469
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:13,810
TRAVIS: I punch it again.

470
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,348
LAURA: Grog! Stop it!

471
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:17,063
TRAVIS: I took a really easy punch.

472
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,731
LAURA: Look, you're hurting it!

473
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,977
TRAVIS: No, I'm not. Is there any blood?

474
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:20,895
MATT: No blood.

475
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,754
LAURA: Trinket blocks it.

476
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:26,672
TRAVIS: Never mind. You know what, I changed my
mind, I don't need a cow. I'm going to go stay in

477
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,675
a normal room.

478
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:32,935
LAURA: No, Grog, actually, I think you should
train for a little bit at least. Just come down to

479
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:34,752
the basement and maybe train for a little bit.

480
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:36,046
TRAVIS: All right.

481
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:41,010
LIAM: I'm sorry, where did that cow come from? I
call one of the servants over to me. Can you get

482
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,520
anything? Could you get me a small squid?

483
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,259
MATT: They all look at each other and shake their
head. "No, sir, we have limited resources here.

484
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:51,741
"The cow, we happened to have one."

485
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:55,854
LIAM: Is that a real cow, Scanlan, or was that
some sort of ghost cow?

486
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,074
SAM: Ghost cow.

487
00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:02,515
MATT: At which point the cow disperses.

488
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,917
TRAVIS: I punched it so hard it exploded.

489
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:08,386
TALIESIN: The ghost of a dinner you've already
eaten, come back to haunt you.

490
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:15,801
LAURA: I go down to the training room. And I stop
the servant and go, can you bring down a bed for me?

491
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:16,878
MATT: Yes.

492
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:19,116
LAURA: Thank you. Grog, can we train, please?

493
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,463
TRAVIS: Yeah. You want to train with me?

494
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,516
LAURA: Yes, I think I need to train with you,
specifically.

495
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:29,033
TRAVIS: All right. Always a good time to get
better, I guess.

496
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,151
SAM: What's going on over there?

497
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:33,220
MARISHA: I don't know.

498
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,322
MATT: You guys walk out of the foyer into the main
hallway, and at the end to the left you see a

499
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:43,685
doorway appear where there wasn't one before. It
opens up on its own, and as you walk you can see

500
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:51,912
stairs that lead down and into a basement chamber
that has a sand pit surrounded by brick. There are

501
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:57,909
a series of wooden training dummies and various
training accoutrements. There are chains hanging

502
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:03,734
from the ceiling for lifting and climbing
exercises. There is a basic set of weapons against

503
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,814
the weapon rack and a basic set of armor on the
other set.

504
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:07,967
SAM: Muscle-ups.

505
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:10,005
TRAVIS: Rope climbs.

506
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:15,176
TALIESIN: Are we really about to pretend to do
Crossfit? Is that a thing that's actually about to

507
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:16,222
happen?

508
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:19,034
SAM: Is there a big thing that says WoD on it?

509
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:22,205
TRAVIS: Wizard of the Day?

510
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:26,803
LAURA: The minute we get downstairs, I start
pawing into the Bag of Holding.

511
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:28,069
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

512
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,528
LAURA: I just need to (grunts).

513
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,849
(a phone dings)

514
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,452
SAM: Ooh, how did you do that?

515
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:34,086
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

516
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:36,648
TRAVIS: What did you grab?

517
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:45,427
LAURA: Oh, just this cleaning utensil, is all. Are
we by ourselves? Nobody else came down, right?

518
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,063
MATT: Just the two of you.

519
00:30:47,063 --> 00:30:50,566
LAURA: Yeah, I just wanted to do some cleaning
with this broom that I--

520
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:51,923
TRAVIS: But this is where you train.

521
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:56,592
LAURA: I put it in the Bag of Holding before.
Maybe you can train over there on those dummies,

522
00:30:56,592 --> 00:31:01,505
and I can just sweep up some of this sand that's
around in this area right here.

523
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,703
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to train. I
thought we were going to fight.

524
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:09,172
LAURA: Yes. Well, Trinket actually wanted some
training with his cannonball. If you will stand

525
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:12,561
still so he can run into you a few times, that
would be swell.

526
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:19,000
TRAVIS: I feel like there's a problem with this
idea, but I'm not sure what it is, so I do it.

527
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,860
MATT: Okay. Trinket comes along with you and, in a
very confused manner, attempts to train with you

528
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,920
for a short time. It's been a while since you
wrestled a bear, so it's kind of fun at times.

529
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,321
LAURA: It's fun, right?

530
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:35,044
TRAVIS: Look, I know I usually hit back, but
apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into

531
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:37,565
me, so give it a go.

532
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,254
LAURA: Go ahead and try, Trinket!

533
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:45,794
MATT: Trinket backs up (bear growling), looks over
at you again like, "Are you sure?" Across the sand

534
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:48,558
flooring into a giant rolling attack towards you.

535
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,989
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

536
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,728
MATT: That is going to be... What's Trinket's
attack bonus?

537
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,885
LAURA: Oh, God, you're really doing it.

538
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:55,837
TRAVIS: Yes!

539
00:31:55,837 --> 00:32:01,631
LAURA: Yes, that's the point of this, to get
Trinket to run into you is the point. His attack

540
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:04,142
bonus is plus eight.

541
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:06,199
MATT: Plus eight, that's a 23 to hit.

542
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,447
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

543
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,604
MATT: You go ahead and take seven points of
bludgeoning damage.

544
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:12,570
LAURA: And you're knocked prone!

545
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,662
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

546
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:22,457
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay. 26.

547
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:29,356
MATT: So Trinket rams into you, and you hold firm
and flex. Conversely, the giant bear bounces off,

548
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:31,365
stumbles back onto Trinket's butt.

549
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:37,547
TRAVIS: That was pretty good! I liked it a lot!

550
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:41,186
MATT: Licks you right along the face, beard
cowlicks up a little bit.

551
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:46,703
TRAVIS: I think this might be a good look for me.
How do I get it to stay?

552
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:50,938
LAURA: While all that is going on, I have a broom
in my hand.

553
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:52,062
MATT: You do.

554
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,950
TRAVIS: I start climbing all over the walls.

555
00:32:53,950 --> 00:33:00,092
LAURA: I put it between my legs and try to sit on
it.

556
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,383
MATT: All right.

557
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:03,523
SAM: Weirdly, I'm doing the same thing upstairs.

558
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,507
(laughter)

559
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,896
TRAVIS: Is one of your servants named Broom?

560
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:11,347
LAURA: And I jump in the air a little bit.

561
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:12,811
MATT: Hop.

562
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:32,994
LAURA: Okay. I say, up! Fly! Lift up! Fatty
Arbuckle! Shenanigans! Ren and Stimpy, I don't know.

563
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,450
TRAVIS: Rotisserie chicken!

564
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,589
LAURA: Fuck! Grog.

565
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,031
TALIESIN: Perhaps it requires a bad Irish accent.

566
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,051
LAURA: (Irish accent) Fatty Arbuckle!

567
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,612
(laughter)

568
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,229
LAURA: Nothing.

569
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:47,450
MATT: Nothing.

570
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,375
TRAVIS: Do you usually yell when you clean?

571
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:56,247
LAURA: (groans) I put the broom on the ground. I
walk over and I punch Grog as hard as I can.

572
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,215
TRAVIS: What was that for?

573
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:00,798
MATT: Grog, it's not very strong.

574
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,400
LAURA: It's not. I'm pretty fucking weak.

575
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,357
TRAVIS: No, I know, but I like to make her feel
good about it. Ow!

576
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:12,089
LAURA: Sorry I hurt you, Grog, I know that was a
very strong punch.

577
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,625
TRAVIS: I look at Trinket and wink.

578
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,972
LAURA: Are you guys good? Do you want to keep
training?

579
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,809
TRAVIS: Yeah, what are you doing?

580
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:22,906
LAURA: Nothing! I put the fucking broom back in
the Bag of Holding.

581
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:24,898
TRAVIS: You didn't clean very much.

582
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:30,216
LAURA: I figured the servants can do it. I walk
upstairs.

583
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:31,531
MATT: Okay.

584
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:34,261
LIAM: Can Scanlan cast Sad Trombone?

585
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:38,247
SAM: We have a music room. I actually have a
trombone.

586
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:41,127
MATT: That's true.

587
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:44,601
SAM: (sad trombone sound)

588
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:48,513
MATT: With Vex not there, Trinket gets a little
antsy and eventually your training session with

589
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:53,570
Trinket comes to an end as Trinket goes to seek
Vex. You can finish your wall climbing in solace.

590
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,384
TRAVIS: All right. I'm good for the night.

591
00:34:58,384 --> 00:34:59,840
MATT: Okay.

592
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,120
TRAVIS: I wanted that cow.

593
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
LAURA: I go find Keyleth.

594
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,762
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know, I'm just chilling.
I'm eating food.

595
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:12,248
TRAVIS: Eating food.

596
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,497
MARISHA: Relaxing.

597
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:20,816
LAURA: Hey! Actually-- no, I don't want to talk to
you. Keyleth. What do you know about magical

598
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:26,521
things? Like a lot?

599
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:35,102
MARISHA: I'm not great at identifying what they
are. I can generally be like, that's magical! But

600
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:39,917
I don't know arcane things, only natural-based
magics.

601
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:44,603
LAURA: Oh, fuck. Thank you so much!

602
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,295
MARISHA: Why?

603
00:35:46,295 --> 00:35:47,922
SAM: Anything I can help you with, Vex?

604
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:53,016
LAURA: Scanlan! I might need to talk to you,
dear.

605
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:55,899
SAM: Should we retire to my room for this?

606
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,069
LAURA: Why, yes, we should.

607
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:03,760
SAM: (excited gasp) I was not expecting that.

608
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,047
MARISHA: Keyleth just picks up her plate and
awkwardly leaves.

609
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:12,017
LAURA: I go get the broom from the Bag of Holding
again.

610
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:16,988
SAM: I run up to my room to make sure that
everything's neat. Light a bunch of candles.

611
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,187
LAURA: I follow him up and knock on the door.

612
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:22,335
MATT: Okay. The door opens up at the first knock.
(creak)

613
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:28,756
SAM: I'm lying in bed. Black satin sheets. Oh, I
forgot you were coming!

614
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:38,364
LAURA: Wow. Well, darling. I shut the door behind
me. I have a favor to ask you.

615
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:43,474
SAM: I should warn you, we're not alone. And I
look over to the five musicians and I ask them to

616
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:45,709
strike up a little--

617
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:53,432
MATT: A gentle classical piece with a small,
low-timbre brass section comes in.

618
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:55,149
SAM: Little bossa nova.

619
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:58,872
MATT: Yeah, it's nice. It's not too involved,
doesn't distract you too much.

620
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:00,826
LAURA: It's nice mood setting, I like it.

621
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:05,756
SAM: Whatever. It's, you know, it's my special
place where I like to come and think about

622
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,572
philosophy and life.

623
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:10,674
LAURA: You're so smart. I've always thought that
about you, that you're very smart.

624
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,598
SAM: Well, many people do.

625
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,012
LAURA: Yes. I sit down next to him on the bed.

626
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:18,407
SAM: (gulps) It goes up and down a bit. It's a
water bed.

627
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:23,629
LAURA: Cozy. Help me!

628
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:25,540
SAM: Is that--

629
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,054
LAURA: What?

630
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:29,243
SAM: Did we see that before?

631
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:34,485
LAURA: Maybe. Okay, Scanlan, I'm a terrible
person, I know.

632
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,302
SAM: What did you do?

633
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:41,078
LAURA: I took a broom from a poor, poor
dragonborn.

634
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:44,063
SAM: You took Gern's magical broom?

635
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,135
LAURA: Maybe.

636
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,605
SAM: Oh my gods.

637
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:50,301
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry, I know, I'm terrible,
and now it won't work and it was pointless and I

638
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,903
want it to work. Help me.

639
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,047
SAM: Because it flies?

640
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:54,580
LAURA: Because it flies, Scanlan.

641
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,431
SAM: What is it with you and flying?

642
00:37:56,431 --> 00:38:01,574
LAURA: I don't know, there's just something about
being up there in the air that makes me feel alive

643
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,732
in a way that I've never felt before.

644
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:05,436
SAM: I could make you fly.

645
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:09,375
LAURA: Okay. Wait-- Oh, you mean. With your cube.

646
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,748
SAM: Yes, that's right.

647
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,941
LAURA: I'd rather you do it with this broom,
actually. And not in any weird way, just to be

648
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:18,418
able to help me make the broom fly. Do you know
how to do that?

649
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:25,671
SAM: I will try. I will examine the broom and make
some sort of check on it.

650
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,018
MATT: Make an arcana check.

651
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:28,591
SAM: Oh, that's not good.

652
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:30,545
TRAVIS: Should've come to me for that.

653
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:31,937
LAURA: Oh, no!

654
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,445
TALIESIN: It's a number.

655
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,566
SAM: 14.

656
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:41,573
MATT: 14. Okay. Looking over the broom, you can
tell it's enchanted. There are runes along the

657
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:49,855
sides of the broom. You do gather from the nature
of the enchantment that it is an item that

658
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:58,846
requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to
initiate its magic. Short of an Identify spell,

659
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:03,238
you would probably have to guess. If you know the
Identify spell, that would be a way for you to.

660
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:08,188
SAM: I don't. Can I examine it to see if there's
any markings, any hidden anything on it?

661
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:12,301
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Or, you know
what, this would be specifically investigation.

662
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:13,815
Investigation check.

663
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:15,901
SAM: Investigation. 21.

664
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:23,611
MATT: You do notice that many of the runes
intricately carved on the side of the broom are--

665
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:30,890
they're part of the enchantment; however, there is
a certain phrase that is not part of the

666
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:37,524
enchantment. It's scrawled into and very cleverly
hidden amongst the broom. It is not Common. What

667
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:38,900
languages do you know?

668
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,792
SAM: Common, Gnome. Pig Latin.

669
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:46,140
MATT: It is not a language you recognize.

670
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,831
LAURA: I speak Elvish, Draconic, Undercommon?

671
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:51,162
SAM: You don't see the words, though.

672
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,514
LAURA: But you saw it.

673
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:57,468
SAM: There's some words here that might be a clue
to the code word. Basically, we need to find the

674
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,549
code word. What do we know about Gern?

675
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,367
LAURA: Well, I tried Fatty Arbuckle. I thought
maybe that was something.

676
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,185
SAM: Did you try the others? Coral? Carol?

677
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,298
LAURA: Coral. Carol.

678
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:07,312
SAM: You probably need to hold it.

679
00:40:07,312 --> 00:40:11,427
LAURA: What was the... Oh. Coral! Carol! I don't
remember the other one's name.

680
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:12,781
SAM: I don't either.

681
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:14,579
LAURA: Stimpy? Was it Stimpy? It was Stimpy!

682
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,979
SAM: Try: On Coral! On Carol! On Stimpy! On Fatty
Arbuckle!

683
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:21,986
LAURA: Wait, but what does the word say? Where's
the word?

684
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,342
SAM: I can't read the words.

685
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:24,819
LAURA: Can I find it? What is it?

686
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,045
MATT: Do you point it out to her?

687
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,194
SAM: I point it out to her.

688
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,036
LAURA: What is it?

689
00:40:28,036 --> 00:40:29,189
MATT: It is Draconic.

690
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:30,281
LAURA: What does it say?

691
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:35,398
MATT: It's archaic Draconic. It's from the base
root of the language, which is one of the oldest

692
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:42,709
languages in civilization. It spells out,
phonetically, the word for candle.

693
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:48,375
LAURA: That's smart. (hacking spit)

694
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:54,862
MATT: At which point, the broom jumps up in your
hands, and almost lifts you off the bed for a

695
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:56,777
second, and you catch it and hold it back down.

696
00:40:56,777 --> 00:41:06,127
LAURA: (singing) Something has changed within me!
Oh my God! Oh my God. Scanlan.

697
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:12,991
SAM: Weirdly, you are not the first floating chick
I've had in my bed. But that is amazing! You're

698
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:13,999
flying!

699
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:17,991
LAURA: I hug him. I hug him as hard as I've ever
hugged Scanlan. I love you so much. You're my

700
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:21,964
favorite person in the entire universe right now.
I owe you--

701
00:41:21,964 --> 00:41:25,518
SAM: Nope. You owe me nothing. That's what friends
are for.

702
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,860
LAURA: I love you.

703
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,181
SAM: I shake her little elf hand.

704
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,685
MATT: It's a pretty big elf hand compared to your
tiny gnome hand.

705
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:33,806
SAM: Okay.

706
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:38,222
LAURA: I sit on it. How high are the ceilings in
here?

707
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:40,236
MATT: How high are the ceilings in your room?

708
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:42,430
SAM: As high as they can be on the top floor.

709
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,722
MATT: For this room, because it is an
extradimensional space, this room is probably a

710
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:50,933
good 50 feet high. High ceilings, with drapery.
It's so garish.

711
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,284
LAURA: Can I sit side-saddle on it?

712
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:53,568
MATT: Yeah.

713
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:56,391
LAURA: (hacking spit) I don't remember how I said
it before.

714
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,920
SAM: You're going to have to remember that now.

715
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,810
MATT: Better write that down. (hacking spit)

716
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,209
LAURA: Why didn't I choose something more fun to
say?

717
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:10,475
MATT: Welcome to D&amp;D. As the words emit from your
mouth, the broom takes off, and you have to aim it

718
00:42:10,475 --> 00:42:16,040
a bit. You start going around in circles, slowly
rising up towards the roof of the room.

719
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,639
LAURA: Yay, this is awesome! I'm really high!

720
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,691
SAM: I instruct the band to start playing Flight
of the Bumblebee.

721
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:29,021
MATT: (whistling)

722
00:42:29,021 --> 00:42:32,707
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Can I take my hands off?

723
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:37,867
MATT: You do, and you start going, "Whoa!" Go
ahead and make a dexterity check.

724
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:41,951
LAURA: Oh my God. I probably should have been
lower to the ground when I said that. Okay, that's

725
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,220
fine. Oh, I'm still exhausted!

726
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,394
MATT: Yep.

727
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:47,547
SAM: Oh, shit.

728
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:50,337
LAURA: 20.

729
00:42:50,337 --> 00:42:54,721
MATT: That's fine. You're fine. A really bad roll
might have had a circumstance, but you manage to

730
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:58,301
catch yourself on the broom in time and, okay.
You're getting the hang of it. It's still not

731
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:01,651
something you're used to, but it's fine.

732
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:03,953
LAURA: Can I point it down towards the ground and
get lower?

733
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:08,300
MATT: You do. And you take a few minutes to figure
out the pitch and wobble of it, and it's less of a

734
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:14,873
directional flight, more than it is a combination
of how you hold the front of the broom and

735
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:20,304
concentrate on its direction. But nevertheless, a
few moments pass, and you get the hang of it.

736
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:24,743
LAURA: Oh. My. God. This is the best day of my
entire life.

737
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,078
SAM: You look great up there.

738
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:27,539
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you.

739
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,104
SAM: But you should not have stolen that!

740
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:32,516
LAURA: Oh, I know, I know, it's terrible!

741
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,003
SAM: He was our friend! He helped us!

742
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,019
LAURA: How bad of a person am I? I'm a horrible
person!

743
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,574
SAM: We should do something to repay the debt!

744
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,835
LAURA: Well, I tried. I was going to give him a
lot of dragon scales, and he wandered away!

745
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:44,429
SAM: We can't possibly find him now.

746
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,361
LAURA: Well, how do I help him? Because I feel
terrible.

747
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:53,321
SAM: If we can't help him, you're going to have to
help someone else to make up for the lost karma.

748
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:58,192
LAURA: I will help as many people as I can while
I'm flying through the air.

749
00:43:58,192 --> 00:44:05,762
SAM: Perhaps I will pick someone for you to help
someday. To repay us both.

750
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:07,443
LAURA: I think that's a deal, Scanlan.

751
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:09,370
SAM: All right. I will mark that down.

752
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:14,327
LAURA: What are you, like, a hag now? I sit on it,
and I open the door, and I fly through the

753
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:15,326
doorway.

754
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:19,485
MATT: She drifts out of the room. The door (slam)
shuts behind her.

755
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:21,589
MARISHA: You're going to be one of those Segway
assholes now!

756
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:22,923
TRAVIS: Yes, totally!

757
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:30,882
MATT: You lean back in your bed, on your fine,
black silken sheets, with Flight of the Bumblebees

758
00:44:30,882 --> 00:44:32,689
still blaring by the fireplace.

759
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:35,094
SAM: All right, guys, it didn't work, you can go.

760
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:41,162
MATT: They all get up. The music stops. And they
all slowly drift out of the room, one by one.

761
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:44,635
Fireplace still crackling.

762
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:46,216
SAM: It's nice in here.

763
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,976
TALIESIN: I'm sitting wherever there's a lounge of
any kind. I'm working in the sketchbook. Working

764
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:51,469
on things.

765
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:52,843
MATT: Not a worry.

766
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:58,044
MARISHA: I'll be reading my alchemy book, because
I have had so little time to catch up on my

767
00:44:58,044 --> 00:44:58,920
reading.

768
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,362
TALIESIN: We never talk anymore, do we?

769
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:01,681
MARISHA: We never do.

770
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:04,203
TALIESIN: Mmm.

771
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:09,041
LAURA: I'm so happy! It's the best!

772
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,785
MATT: So good!

773
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:15,601
LAURA: I'm going to try to sleep. It's going to be
really, really hard because I'm so excited, but I

774
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,288
really need to get some rest!

775
00:45:17,288 --> 00:45:18,579
MARISHA: Did you feed the dog?

776
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:24,479
TALIESIN: Today? I don't know.

777
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:28,310
MATT: So, anyone want to do anything else? You
going to go rest for the evening?

778
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,330
TRAVIS: I rest.

779
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,272
TALIESIN: I'm good.

780
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:36,362
MATT: All right. You all eventually find your ways
to your rooms, happy and comfortable in the fact

781
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:44,172
that no one has to take watch for this night. As
you all get to bed, a few hours into the evening,

782
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:50,457
Keyleth, you are just starting to doze off when
you hear a knock at the door.

783
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:53,710
MARISHA: (gasps awake) Scanlan?

784
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,067
MATT: You open the door?

785
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:58,181
MARISHA: On my door?

786
00:45:58,181 --> 00:46:00,171
MATT: On your door.

787
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,346
MARISHA: Who is it?

788
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:08,773
MATT: "Keyleth, it is Cerkonos. Please open up. I
wish to speak with you."

789
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:10,859
MARISHA: I open the door.

790
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:18,894
MATT: Okay. Cerkonos comes in. The first thing you
notice-- previously, you had seen what was his

791
00:46:18,894 --> 00:46:26,127
burned-off arm at the shoulder. You can now see
the flesh is extended and is currently very slowly

792
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:32,108
in the process of regenerating his lost arm. And
it catches you off-guard for a moment, and he puts

793
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:38,958
his hand up and says, "Sorry, it is not very
presentable." And he still keeps his hand over it,

794
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:51,033
slightly embarrassed by the mid-regenerative state
of it. "I'm sorry to have disturbed you, I come as

795
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:56,771
"unease has taken my mind." And he enters the room
and closes the door behind him. "May we sit?"

796
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:58,928
MARISHA: Of course, please, Cerkonos.

797
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:02,540
MATT: He goes over and takes one of the nearby
chairs and sets it down, places one across from

798
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:12,510
him for you to sit, gestures with his one arm.
Sits down. "I would not speak with those I do not

799
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:20,513
"trust. And I have seen your purity of soul,
Keyleth. So I come to you with these concerns."

800
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:31,133
His eyes trail off for a moment in the distance,
and he gathers his thoughts and his words. "Four

801
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:44,207
"years ago, a young woman came to Pyrah for
redemption. A lost girl, cast out and wishing for

802
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:56,724
"acceptance. We, as we do with outcasts, took her
in, taught her. And in time, called her one of our

803
00:47:56,724 --> 00:48:12,099
"own, one of the Pyrah. In recent months, she began
to grow distant, taking to staying in the

804
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:22,851
"Cindergrove unattended for days at a time. One
afternoon, the mountain moved, angry with shifting

805
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:34,666
"fires. We felt a disturbance in the Gate, and when
we went to investigate, there she was, commanding

806
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:37,362
"powers we did not know she had."

807
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:42,634
MARISHA: What kind of powers? Beyond those of
druidic nature?

808
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:55,260
MATT: "These were the magics taken by man who defied
the gods. These were the purest of ancient arcane

809
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:05,716
"threads. We watched as she reached out and tore
open the Gate. She laughed as we called out to

810
00:49:05,716 --> 00:49:11,523
"stop. But something terrible emerged from that
wounded sky."

811
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:13,604
MARISHA: Thordak?

812
00:49:13,604 --> 00:49:21,445
MATT: "This dragon you speak of, yes. I defended
all that I could, but the power was too great, and

813
00:49:21,445 --> 00:49:31,584
"unconsciousness took me. I awoke to my people in
tatters, the fires untethered, and this terrible

814
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:47,505
"girl gone. It is both embarrassing and greatly
alarming that we could be infiltrated by such an

815
00:49:47,505 --> 00:49:54,635
"entity. That blame falls on me, as the headmaster,
for not seeing this earlier."

816
00:49:54,635 --> 00:50:01,281
MARISHA: You acted within the good nature of our
people, there's nothing wrong with that. How old

817
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:04,398
was this girl when she came to you? And how old is
she now?

818
00:50:04,398 --> 00:50:07,018
MATT: "When she came to us she couldn't be more
than 15."

819
00:50:07,018 --> 00:50:11,076
MARISHA: So she's 19, 20?

820
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:21,167
MATT: "Perhaps. She did not seem to blossom into
womanhood as many do. We considered her more of a

821
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:24,170
"runt of her litter, if you will."

822
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,272
MARISHA: And what was her race?

823
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:32,171
MATT: "She seemed human."

824
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:35,695
MARISHA: She seemed human? What do you mean?

825
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:46,290
MATT: "We take many forms as druids. If she was
indeed human, at that age, to command such power...

826
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,892
"I do not know her true nature."

827
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:51,639
MARISHA: What was her name?

828
00:50:51,639 --> 00:51:05,615
MATT: "Her name was Raishan. Anyway. I wish to
tell you this because my heart is heavy with

829
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:21,082
"guilt, and I want you to know that even in places
of comfort, family, be careful, keep those you

830
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:30,289
"know you can trust close. Be mindful of those that
promise aid when they have not proven themselves.

831
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:35,762
"If you have an instinct, follow it."

832
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:40,345
MARISHA: Are you referring to something in
particular, Cerkonos?

833
00:51:40,345 --> 00:51:49,578
MATT: "I just do not wish you to make the same
mistake I did. Anyway, I thank you for your

834
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:53,994
"companions and you coming to our aid. It shall not
be forgotten."

835
00:51:53,994 --> 00:52:05,054
MARISHA: I shall keep an ear open for the name
Raishan. If I hear anything about her, I'll send word.

836
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:13,391
MATT: "Should you need the aid of the Pyrah,
though we are not much at now, come find me. I

837
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:19,283
"look forward for to you bringing Zephrah together.
You will make a fine leader."

838
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:26,936
MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. And I'm glad that
you're still with us.

839
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,306
MATT: "Kaitiaki, Keyleth."

840
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:30,820
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, Cerkonos.

841
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,472
MATT: Cerkonos leaves.

842
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:40,930
MARISHA: And I start poring through my notes for
the name Raishan, because Keyleth believes she has

843
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:47,094
heard that name before as one of the dragons,
correct? One of the white--

844
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:48,407
LAURA: (whispering) It's the green one.

845
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:51,110
MARISHA: --the green one. Okay, okay.

846
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,830
MATT: That is true.

847
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,549
MARISHA: Do I have any other reference, would I
know anything else about that?

848
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:04,490
MATT: That's all you know, is the name
Raishan was used when the Conclave attacked Emon.

849
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:09,043
And it seemed the name belonged to the green
dragon that initiated the assault where you guys were.

850
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:11,248
MARISHA: Fucking bitch.

851
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:17,393
MATT: So, these thoughts echoing through your
mind--

852
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:20,346
TALIESIN: Streets will run green with revenge!

853
00:53:20,346 --> 00:53:21,761
MARISHA: Yes, they will!

854
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:27,888
MATT: You sleep, but uneasily, as all of these
realizations swirl in your head. Eventually sleep

855
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:38,888
takes you, but it is not an easy sleep. Just
enough to function. Barely. Vax. As you yourself

856
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:45,499
have attempted to stave off sleep for many days,
pushing yourself to your limits, it finally takes

857
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:54,718
its toll, and you drift off into a deep, deep
slumber. In that slumber, you find yourself in

858
00:53:54,718 --> 00:54:07,223
darkness. Echoes of a distant voice, muffled, as
if underwater. Crash. The darkness is shattered

859
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:14,944
into a thousand black feathers, and you find
yourself falling, falling. Falling towards what

860
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:22,665
seems to be a tangled net of glowing threads.
You're afraid you might impact at such a speed,

861
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:31,617
but before you do, you slow and come to a stop
before this extremely prominent glowing weave,

862
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:41,319
this infinite tapestry in all directions. You are
uncertain of the meaning of this moment when a

863
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:49,155
large cold hand reaches past your shoulder and
grasps a thread right before your face, this

864
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:56,497
singular glowing thread, pulsing with light like a
heartbeat. You follow the arm over your shoulder,

865
00:54:56,497 --> 00:55:06,155
and glance up directly into the massive form of
the Raven Queen: porcelain face like a mask, long

866
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:15,436
jet-black hair, her body encasing you like a
physical cage. Your eyes follow the arm back to

867
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:23,551
the thread that she carries between her massive
fingers. She tugs it, ever so gently, and it

868
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:33,606
causes waves to ripple through the tapestry into
infinity. Her voice fills your mind, both calm but

869
00:55:33,606 --> 00:55:47,968
cold. "This is you, my champion. You are
fate-touched. The choice is yours. Rebirth or

870
00:55:47,968 --> 00:56:01,930
"ruin. Maker or martyr. Conqueror, tyrant, or
nothing." She plucks the thread from the weave,

871
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:07,300
snapping it. You plummet into the hole left behind
it, falling faster and faster into the dark.

872
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,231
Losing control, you turn around and see the Raven
Queen, disappearing into the distance, growing

873
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:19,637
smaller and smaller, until suddenly, nothing.

874
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:26,302
Grog. You fall into a deep snore, heavy, heavy
snore, after drinking the wine, climbing up walls,

875
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:28,602
you've had an exhausting day of--

876
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:30,022
TRAVIS: Sleeping in the sand pit.

877
00:56:30,022 --> 00:56:32,561
MATT: Okay, you are face down.

878
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:34,851
TRAVIS: Like a beach, just (snore).

879
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:38,988
MATT: It's great. You've drooled into the sand,
and it's clustered around your beard. It's

880
00:56:38,988 --> 00:56:46,985
horrifying. But in the middle of snoring, this
restful sleep also comes into your mind, and you

881
00:56:46,985 --> 00:56:52,501
find yourself walking alone. A long hallway, into
blinding light. You have to cover your face, it's

882
00:56:52,501 --> 00:57:00,499
so bright, but you push forward because you know
there's only one way to go. You cannot see, but

883
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:06,688
you can hear around you and sense the hallway's
ended, and there's now space around you. You

884
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:14,181
cannot see, but you sense an arena, gladiatorial
in nature. You can hear the distant whisper and

885
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,881
hum of crowds cheering.

886
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:18,871
SAM: Phillip! Phillip!

887
00:57:18,871 --> 00:57:28,567
MATT: You sense others around you, closing in
suddenly. A voice, ever-whispering in your ear,

888
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:36,034
says, "Release me." Still blinded, eyes closed, on
instinct, you pull the cold, dark blade from your

889
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:41,771
back and swing wide, over and over again, feeling
the shuddering shock of each impact, your strength

890
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:47,778
matched by the razor-like edge of your weapon,
cleaving down any who would approach. The high of

891
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:52,273
adrenaline is incredible, and you laugh aloud at
the sheer thrill of your own power.

892
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:53,986
TRAVIS: (laughs triumphantly)

893
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:59,834
MATT: The light subsides and your vision returns.
You look to see hundreds of people dead at your

894
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:13,863
feet. Farmers, children. You see Pike, motionless,
cast among the carnage. You want to scream, but

895
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:20,224
instead you laugh, against your own judgment and
intent, like you're locked within yourself and

896
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:27,153
have no control. And as you look up from the pile
of corpses at your feet, you see a towering figure

897
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:37,287
before you, cast in furs and bone, standing even a
head and a half's height above you, is Kevdak,

898
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:48,316
looking down at you with pride. The entire herd
steps up beside him, staring at you atop your

899
00:58:48,316 --> 00:59:01,509
throne of corpses, and the herd kneels. Kevdak
bows, looking up at you, smiling. "You. You have

900
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:07,833
"finally made me proud, Grog."

901
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:16,854
You wake up (gasp), spittle and sand and grit
mashed against your face. Who knows how long it's

902
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:25,657
been, but it's been a while since you've had a
dream, let alone one like that.

903
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:30,106
Now, as you all eventually come to in the morning,
having your evening's rest, you've recovered your

904
00:59:30,106 --> 00:59:35,899
hit points, your spells, all of the usual good
stuff, in a fantastic mansion. Maybe not the most

905
00:59:35,899 --> 00:59:41,232
fantastic rest for some of you, but a fantastic
mansion. You all eventually find your way to the

906
00:59:41,232 --> 00:59:46,887
breakfast nook, which is as extravagant as you
would imagine a Scanlan-based

907
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:48,671
breakfast nook would be.

908
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:53,793
TALIESIN: Green marble, silver tiling. Sorry,
carry on.

909
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:55,178
MARISHA: Crystal chandelier.

910
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:56,683
SAM: Waffle presses.

911
00:59:56,683 --> 01:00:01,233
MATT: There's a fantastic breakfast feast already
prepared, rows of servants along the walls waiting

912
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:07,605
eagerly to attend to you guys as you sit down,
pouring fresh juices. It smells fantastic, and

913
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:09,906
most of you look rested, except for a handful.

914
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:14,357
SAM: Eat! Drink!

915
01:00:14,357 --> 01:00:16,821
LAURA: I come skipping into the room, for sure.

916
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,732
TALIESIN: Good morning.

917
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:20,766
SAM: You're looking delighted and delightful.

918
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:23,185
LAURA: What a beautiful day it is!

919
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:26,610
MARISHA: Do you have wine and ale at the breakfast
buffet?

920
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,755
SAM: Sure, sure. There's mimosas, there's--

921
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:30,171
MARISHA: I'll have a mimosa.

922
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:32,470
TALIESIN: You've never heard of breakfast beer?

923
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:38,383
SAM: Breakfast beer? Sure. There's milk from a cow
with a broken nose.

924
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:45,995
LAURA: Oh, that is so sad. Can you heal it? Can it
be healed?

925
01:00:45,995 --> 01:00:50,754
SAM: It'll be fine. When we leave this place, all
these people die, anyway.

926
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:54,298
TALIESIN: You're supposed to churn the milk after
it leaves the cow.

927
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:59,162
LAURA: Wait, Scanlan, can we store things here, or
does it all disappear as soon as we leave?

928
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:00,876
SAM: I don't know.

929
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,463
MATT: You haven't tried it before.

930
01:01:02,463 --> 01:01:05,087
LAURA: We should leave something inconsequential.

931
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:08,801
SAM: We'll leave Trinket, and then we'll try it
again, and if Trinket's still here, we'll know.

932
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:11,536
MARISHA: Schrodinger's Trinket.

933
01:01:11,536 --> 01:01:13,992
SAM: It's just-- no?

934
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:14,950
LAURA: No.

935
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,062
SAM: All right. We'll leave the broom and see if
it's still here.

936
01:01:17,062 --> 01:01:18,604
LAURA: No, no, no, let's not.

937
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:19,797
TALIESIN: What broom?

938
01:01:19,797 --> 01:01:23,769
SAM: Oh, Vex, is there something you'd like to
admit to the rest of the group? They'll see you

939
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:25,699
use it sooner or later.

940
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:31,199
MATT: You hear a voice go (grunt). Trinket's over
there, face covered in breakfast food, trying to

941
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,620
sit at one of the edges of the table like a
person, the actual bowing of the wooden bench that

942
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,650
Trinket's on, you hear the creaking as he moves
around in it.

943
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:51,053
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan, for making me feel...
So, guess what! I can fly! A-plus!

944
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:53,356
TALIESIN: How did that happen?

945
01:01:53,356 --> 01:02:01,563
MARISHA: I had a really weird night, too. What
happened in your... because, I mean, flight?

946
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:03,561
LAURA: Did you have a weird night? Do you want to
tell us about it?

947
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:05,152
MARISHA: No, I want to hear about your night.

948
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:06,994
TALIESIN: I think you go first.

949
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:09,914
MARISHA: I want to learn how you fly.

950
01:02:09,914 --> 01:02:14,734
LAURA: Okay. So I sort of kind of tricked Gern,
I'm a terrible person.

951
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,433
SAM: Gern, our friend.

952
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,443
TRAVIS: You swallowed that last part. What did you
say?

953
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:27,278
LAURA: I sort of kind of, this is the worst...
took something that wasn't mine? In a way. I mean,

954
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:32,789
I was holding on to it, and then I slipped, and it
fell into the Bag of Holding.

955
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:35,087
TRAVIS: Why is that bad?

956
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:36,755
TALIESIN: You stole from a candlemaker?

957
01:02:36,755 --> 01:02:38,491
LAURA: I stole from a necromancer.

958
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,987
TALIESIN: Slash candlemaker.

959
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:45,764
LAURA: Yes. No, he was a nice guy.

960
01:02:45,764 --> 01:02:50,780
SAM: I think we should hear Vax's opinion of this.

961
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,818
MARISHA: Vax, I think you were a bad influence.

962
01:02:53,818 --> 01:03:02,412
LIAM: I can't judge. I've done my share in the past. I
thought you were a little overly nice to him.

963
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,743
TALIESIN: I mean, to be fair, we did steal a
carpet once.

964
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:05,767
LAURA: We did.

965
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:07,198
SAM: Did we steal that? I thought it was just a--

966
01:03:07,198 --> 01:03:09,246
MARISHA: We used that in an emergency.

967
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:10,549
TRAVIS: We commandeered it.

968
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:12,518
LAURA: We took it, Scanlan, and we didn't tell
Allura.

969
01:03:12,518 --> 01:03:14,208
TALIESIN: And then never gave it back.

970
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,370
SAM: That's true.

971
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,364
LAURA: We're terrible.

972
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:20,142
LIAM: I don't think any of us can judge you,
Vex'ahlia, but it does strike me as a little bit

973
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:23,212
odd, if nothing else.

974
01:03:23,212 --> 01:03:29,500
LAURA: I know. I know, I'm afraid these rogue
tendencies I've been learning from you, brother,

975
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:35,903
maybe rubbed off a little bit. No, I just, I know
I shouldn't have.

976
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:37,579
TRAVIS: I don't care.

977
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:42,347
LAURA: I wanted to return it right away, and then
he wandered off. That's a lie, I didn't want to

978
01:03:42,347 --> 01:03:44,395
return it. But I did want to pay him!

979
01:03:44,395 --> 01:03:46,529
TRAVIS: I don't think you wanted to do that
either.

980
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:50,783
LAURA: No, I did! I did, I wanted to pay him! But
he wandered away, and then I didn't pay him, and

981
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:57,346
now I have this broom that I stole, and there's
really no way to return it. Well, I probably could

982
01:03:57,346 --> 01:03:59,947
find him, but I don't want to because now I can
fly, you guys.

983
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:01,845
TRAVIS: Are you going to re-gift it?

984
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:03,683
LAURA: No. I'm going to keep it.

985
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:06,377
MARISHA: What do you say, Percy? I think it's kind
of funny.

986
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:09,700
TALIESIN: Are you honestly asking my opinion? You
said what?

987
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,648
LAURA: Actually, Percy, do you know-- I know you can
build things and make things wonderful.

988
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:19,009
TALIESIN: Can you show me? What is this thing,
what did you steal? What is this thing?

989
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:21,285
LAURA: I pull out the broom and I lift up in the
air.

990
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:24,827
MATT: You guys watch as Vex all of a sudden
(whoosh) takes off above the breakfast room.

991
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,832
TRAVIS: Sweet!

992
01:04:25,832 --> 01:04:28,641
MARISHA: All right, that is pretty cool, Vex.
That's pretty badass.

993
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:30,336
TALIESIN: I don't know if I approve of the
metaphor, but that's--

994
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,305
LIAM: What happens when you shoot a couple arrows
from up there?

995
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:33,577
TRAVIS: Yeah, shoot me with an arrow!

996
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:34,754
MARISHA: Yeah, shoot some arrows!

997
01:04:34,754 --> 01:04:36,712
TALIESIN: Okay, you're not holding onto the broom
anymore.

998
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:38,823
LAURA: No, I've been practicing! I've been
practicing!

999
01:04:38,823 --> 01:04:44,829
MARISHA: I reach on the table and I grab what I'm
sure is a whole chicken sitting there.

1000
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:45,815
SAM: Sure.

1001
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,666
MARISHA: And I hold it up and I go--

1002
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,856
TALIESIN: Has it not occurred to you that you're
not going to be able to fly?

1003
01:04:49,856 --> 01:04:53,947
LAURA: No, no, no, look! I'm not holding on,
Percy! Look at me, not holding on!

1004
01:04:53,947 --> 01:04:56,118
MARISHA: Okay, Vex, ready? Ready, Vex? Vex?

1005
01:04:56,118 --> 01:04:56,930
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

1006
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:57,874
MARISHA: Trust.

1007
01:04:57,874 --> 01:04:59,406
SAM: Watch your eyes. Watch your eyes.

1008
01:04:59,406 --> 01:05:01,169
MARISHA: Trust Vex!

1009
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:04,197
MATT: All right, Laura, I want you to go ahead
and, first, roll a dexterity check.

1010
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:09,025
LAURA: Okay. Shut up! 13.

1011
01:05:09,025 --> 01:05:16,076
MATT: 13, okay. You almost slip off the broom in
the process of drawing the arrow from the quiver.

1012
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:20,803
You catch yourself and just barely manage to pull
back and fire. I want you to go ahead and roll an

1013
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,588
attack with disadvantage.

1014
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:25,491
LAURA: Oh, man, disadvantage. Okay.

1015
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:30,877
MARISHA: Please, god, may your aim be true today,
Vex.

1016
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:33,165
LAURA: 16.

1017
01:05:33,165 --> 01:05:38,665
MATT: 16. (impact) The arrow does get relatively
close to your hand, but it does

1018
01:05:38,665 --> 01:05:40,365
stick into the turkey.

1019
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:43,416
MARISHA: She did it! I hand the chicken to
Scanlan.

1020
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,354
SAM: I start eating.

1021
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:47,307
TALIESIN: I pull the arrow out of the chicken.

1022
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:51,675
LIAM: Do it again! And I throw the chicken
closest to me into the air.

1023
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:52,867
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1024
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:53,840
SAM: A moving target!

1025
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,954
LAURA: Oh, god, okay.

1026
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:56,341
MATT: Okay, make another dexterity check.

1027
01:05:56,341 --> 01:05:57,442
LAURA: Okay.

1028
01:05:57,442 --> 01:05:58,622
SAM: There's lots of chickens, by the way.

1029
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,382
LAURA: Shit balls. 13.

1030
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:04,713
MATT: 13. Okay, this time, you start falling off
and you catch yourself entirely. The arrow just

1031
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:06,838
goes wide, you don't even get a chance to nock it
in the bow.

1032
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,739
LAURA: Mother bitch, I really need to work on
this! Okay.

1033
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:10,050
MARISHA: It'll take some practice.

1034
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,902
TALIESIN: I don't think this is-- this may be an
engineering issue.

1035
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,249
LAURA: Yes, Percy, this is the thing. Can you
build a seat on this?

1036
01:06:16,249 --> 01:06:20,089
TALIESIN: I pull out my notepad and start
sketching.

1037
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:24,381
LAURA: What if you could build a seat, and then I
can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this

1038
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:25,509
tiny little stick?

1039
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:26,774
TALIESIN: Let me--

1040
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,063
SAM: Tinker?

1041
01:06:28,063 --> 01:06:29,102
TALIESIN: Tinker.

1042
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:33,719
MARISHA: You know, beyond it being an engineering
issue, it might be a greed issue first.

1043
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:36,003
LAURA: Really?

1044
01:06:36,003 --> 01:06:39,509
MARISHA: Look--

1045
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:41,445
LAURA: How's that mimosa treating you?

1046
01:06:41,445 --> 01:06:49,693
MARISHA: It's phenomenal. It's been a long few
weeks. I don't care. I don't care. We're never

1047
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:53,338
going to see Gern again. I have so many other
things to care about.

1048
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:54,741
SAM: Oh, no, she's day drunk again.

1049
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:56,190
LAURA: Oh, no, are you already drunk, Keyleth?

1050
01:06:56,190 --> 01:07:00,279
MARISHA: No! I'm just, it's been a long few--
Look.

1051
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:01,350
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus!

1052
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,702
MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

1053
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:07,282
TRAVIS: How many was that? Just one, right? We've
been here for five minutes.

1054
01:07:07,282 --> 01:07:08,651
LAURA: I float down.

1055
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:11,101
MARISHA: No! I just don't want you to die.

1056
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:14,247
LAURA: I float down eye-level, but I'm still
floating.

1057
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:18,871
MARISHA: I don't want you to die. I don't want you
to die because of your greed. I don't care that

1058
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:23,382
you have-- You look amazing. Doesn't she look
amazing?

1059
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:26,917
TALIESIN: Like a real hoverboard, is there a
chance this one might set on fire as well?

1060
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,747
LAURA: Why are you trying to be an asshole?

1061
01:07:28,747 --> 01:07:29,905
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1062
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:37,513
LAURA: Here's the thing, Keyleth. I'm not afraid
to die anymore. I came to this realization. I've

1063
01:07:37,513 --> 01:07:42,277
seen the other side. I've come to terms with it.

1064
01:07:42,277 --> 01:07:46,103
MARISHA: Well, that's phenomenal that you've come
to terms with it! I don't know about the rest of

1065
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,434
us in the room that all watched you die, though.

1066
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:51,398
TALIESIN: I feel too guilty to say no to her. I'm
perfectly content to let this go.

1067
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,120
TRAVIS: It is pretty sweet, flying around like
that.

1068
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,161
LAURA: It's pretty wonderful.

1069
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:55,209
MARISHA: It's really cool.

1070
01:07:55,209 --> 01:08:01,901
TALIESIN: She's an adult. Deep levels of arrested
development, but an adult nonetheless.

1071
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:04,049
MARISHA: I don't care about the broom.

1072
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:07,543
SAM: Keyleth, Vex swore to me that she would only
use it for good.

1073
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:10,964
LAURA: That's right. I'm not going to steal
anything while I'm riding on it.

1074
01:08:10,964 --> 01:08:13,314
TALIESIN: Where would you put it, anyway? You
can't let go.

1075
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:16,709
MARISHA: Just don't get into trouble, I guess.

1076
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:20,088
LAURA: I'll practice as much as I can, and Percy's
going to help me.

1077
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:21,123
TALIESIN: Yes.

1078
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:22,954
LAURA: So I can be stable on this thing.

1079
01:08:22,954 --> 01:08:25,443
TALIESIN: I may need some money, but we'll put
something together.

1080
01:08:25,443 --> 01:08:26,937
LAURA: I will give you all the money you want.

1081
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,105
LIAM: Are you going to carry that on your back?

1082
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,427
LAURA: Maybe.

1083
01:08:30,427 --> 01:08:32,828
LIAM: You'll look like a Byroden chimney sweep.

1084
01:08:32,828 --> 01:08:35,727
LAURA: But I feel so good.

1085
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:42,959
MARISHA: You got out, you came out on top this
time. It might not happen next time.

1086
01:08:42,959 --> 01:08:44,735
LAURA: I start eating while sitting on the broom.

1087
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:46,935
MARISHA: All right. I think she's listening to me.

1088
01:08:46,935 --> 01:08:48,341
SAM: I think you broke through.

1089
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:49,376
MARISHA: I think I did.

1090
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:51,286
TALIESIN: I think you're learning to let people be
people.

1091
01:08:51,286 --> 01:08:52,756
MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

1092
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:56,359
SAM: Oh, look, look! Another round of chickens has
just arrived for us to eat.

1093
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:57,964
MARISHA: Oh, chicken!

1094
01:08:57,964 --> 01:09:01,982
SAM: I don't know what breakfast is, so I just
keep commanding them to make chickens.

1095
01:09:01,982 --> 01:09:04,664
MATT: So much chicken, guys.

1096
01:09:04,664 --> 01:09:06,609
LAURA: Where should we head to?

1097
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:13,057
SAM: What is our next-- Shoot, I kept a to-do list
for us, but I didn't bring it tonight.

1098
01:09:13,057 --> 01:09:14,495
TRAVIS: (burps)

1099
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:17,218
SAM: Oh. I thought you were going to say
something. That was a belch?

1100
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:18,157
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1101
01:09:18,157 --> 01:09:21,199
LAURA: Did you want to head back to-- Actually,
Keyleth, you said something weird happened last

1102
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,065
night for you as well.

1103
01:09:23,065 --> 01:09:33,430
MARISHA: Yeah. Cerkonos stopped by.

1104
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:39,742
LAURA: Yeah? I look at my brother. All right,
cool. Keep going.

1105
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:51,223
MARISHA: Not... As my elder. He stopped by as my
respected elder. Do you all remember

1106
01:09:51,223 --> 01:09:52,958
the name Raishan?

1107
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,274
TALIESIN: Yes.

1108
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,918
LAURA: That's one of the dragons.

1109
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:59,660
MARISHA: Apparently she's our little
infiltrator.

1110
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,519
LAURA: What do you mean?

1111
01:10:01,519 --> 01:10:11,270
MARISHA: She came to the Fire Ashari, she came to
Pyrah, about four years ago, and the Ashari, being

1112
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,497
the adoptive people that we are, they took her in.

1113
01:10:14,497 --> 01:10:15,867
LAURA: They adopted a dragon?

1114
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:18,202
MARISHA: They adopted a dragon.

1115
01:10:18,202 --> 01:10:20,136
LAURA: How?

1116
01:10:20,136 --> 01:10:22,960
TALIESIN: Do they think she's the one who
sabotaged the rift?

1117
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:29,606
MARISHA: They do. They were unaware that she was a
dragon.

1118
01:10:29,606 --> 01:10:32,666
SAM: Does that make her the leader or something?
Is that how all the dragons got through? I'm still

1119
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,042
not quite sure.

1120
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,908
TALIESIN: It makes her the instigator, at the very
least.

1121
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:42,551
MARISHA: It makes her fairly close to Thordak, it
would seem. Apparently, when she came to the Fire

1122
01:10:42,551 --> 01:10:45,832
Ashari, she was about 15 years old, and...

1123
01:10:45,832 --> 01:10:47,392
SAM: As a dragon?

1124
01:10:47,392 --> 01:10:48,530
TALIESIN: Visually.

1125
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,330
MARISHA: As a human woman.

1126
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:53,181
LAURA: So she was making it seem like she was 15.

1127
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:58,547
MARISHA: She was making it seem like she was 15,
and they started realizing that she possessed

1128
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:08,492
powers far beyond anything that they had seen
before, and then these powers began to exceed

1129
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:15,217
anything beyond our druidic capabilities. And it
would seem that they realized that too late.

1130
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:20,574
SAM: Did they say anything about her goals, or
motivations? Her ambitions?

1131
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:29,379
MARISHA: Cerkonos said one day they woke up and
the mountain was spewing fire, and was angry with

1132
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:42,838
lava, and when he went to investigate it, she was
there, ripping open the rift. And that was when

1133
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:46,719
everything happened. When he came to
consciousness, everything was destroyed, so that's

1134
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:52,297
all he saw. And she was gone. But we know where
she went next.

1135
01:11:52,297 --> 01:11:55,483
TRAVIS: Where?

1136
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:58,864
SAM: To Emon.

1137
01:11:58,864 --> 01:12:00,312
LAURA: Oh, eventually.

1138
01:12:00,312 --> 01:12:01,453
SAM: Kill everybody.

1139
01:12:01,453 --> 01:12:03,951
LAURA: Right. Totally. That day. The day.

1140
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:08,550
MARISHA: I was trying to skip exposition, I
thought you guys could fill in the blanks.

1141
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,231
TALIESIN: We thought you had new information
beyond that and would maybe want to add. It was

1142
01:12:12,231 --> 01:12:13,635
certainly set up that way.

1143
01:12:13,635 --> 01:12:15,572
MARISHA: Thank you. I'll work on that next time.

1144
01:12:15,572 --> 01:12:16,812
TALIESIN: It was very leading.

1145
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:19,035
LAURA: Okay, well that's good to know.

1146
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:26,401
SAM: So perhaps we should inquire if you think
this-- Raishan?

1147
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:28,005
MARISHA: Raishan.

1148
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:34,859
SAM: Has tried to pretend to be a human woman in
any other place? Should we ask around, or was it

1149
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:39,767
just the one ruse here to gain entry for her
companions?

1150
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:42,324
MARISHA: I'm not sure.

1151
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,924
SAM: All right. Well, don't trust anyone.

1152
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:48,489
MARISHA: Don't trust anyone.

1153
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,678
LAURA: Got it.

1154
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:52,531
MATT: Servant rushes forward, "More chicken,
sir?"

1155
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:54,361
SAM: Keep it coming.

1156
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:55,503
MATT: "Right away."

1157
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:57,414
LAURA: Do you guys have vegetables, maybe? Any
vegetables?

1158
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,712
MATT: "Vegetables, sir?"

1159
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:01,865
SAM: I forgot to tell them to make them. Sorry.
It's all chicken.

1160
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:02,996
MATT: "Chicken it is."

1161
01:13:02,996 --> 01:13:08,429
LAURA: Cool. Chicken and mimosas, it's my favorite
breakfast.

1162
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:10,256
MARISHA: And waffles.

1163
01:13:10,256 --> 01:13:15,432
SAM: Oh, waffles too? Chicken and waffles, that's
right. Maybe someone else should be in charge of

1164
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:20,206
the food next time we come here. My tastes are a
little--

1165
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:21,585
TALIESIN: Base?

1166
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:22,751
LAURA: Little?

1167
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:24,111
SAM: Singular.

1168
01:13:24,111 --> 01:13:30,337
MARISHA: And one thing that this does confirm is
that this has been a plan that's been in the

1169
01:13:30,337 --> 01:13:33,049
process for a very, very long time.

1170
01:13:33,049 --> 01:13:35,715
SAM: No, I just came up with the chicken this
morning when I woke up.

1171
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:37,536
LAURA: Where are we going next, you guys?

1172
01:13:37,536 --> 01:13:45,492
SAM: Grog had some brass knuckles to get. Was that
a thing? Did we get those?

1173
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:50,901
TRAVIS: No. We haven't gotten those yet. But
there's other things to explore.

1174
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:56,502
SAM: All right. Wait, did we have to go make a
trip to anyone else's homeland? How's Whitestone?

1175
01:13:56,502 --> 01:14:01,366
LAURA: We need to talk to a sphinx. A sphinx's
boyfriend.

1176
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:05,107
SAM: Oh, that's right. Maybe that should be our
next--

1177
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,154
MARISHA: What was his name? Hang on.

1178
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:11,525
SAM: And what were we trying to get there? Another
one of the articles of confederation?

1179
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:16,648
MARISHA: We need the Titanstone Knuckles of Kord,
which Kevdak has.

1180
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,581
TRAVIS: Yep.

1181
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:21,065
LAURA: That's with your tribe.

1182
01:14:21,065 --> 01:14:22,183
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1183
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:24,125
SAM: Okay, but then there's the sphinx.

1184
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:25,871
LIAM: Time for a family reunion, Grog.

1185
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:27,145
SAM: What's that, Vax?

1186
01:14:27,145 --> 01:14:31,531
LIAM: I said it's time for a family reunion, Grog.
Are you ready for that, or do you want to put that

1187
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:33,060
off a bit?

1188
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:39,281
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I mean. Whenever. It's. You know.

1189
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:43,175
LAURA: So do you want to go now, or do you want to
maybe swing by somewhere?

1190
01:14:43,175 --> 01:14:44,959
TALIESIN: It's either that or the library, I
imagine.

1191
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:46,677
TRAVIS: You want to go to the library?

1192
01:14:46,677 --> 01:14:49,724
TALIESIN: I was just saying that it's either that
or the library.

1193
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:52,911
SAM: So it's Grog's herd or the sphinx to get
something.

1194
01:14:52,911 --> 01:14:54,909
LAURA: We'll remember.

1195
01:14:54,909 --> 01:15:02,816
SAM: On the way. And then, or, TBD, find something
else to do. I guess Grog's thing is the most

1196
01:15:02,816 --> 01:15:06,685
promising. We know that there's Knuckles there, we
know that there's people we'll know there.

1197
01:15:06,685 --> 01:15:11,756
LAURA: Well, it's all actually around Westruun,
right? Aren't your people around Westruun?

1198
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:13,257
TRAVIS: You know, they roam.

1199
01:15:13,257 --> 01:15:15,102
LAURA: So we have to find them.

1200
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:16,077
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1201
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:19,437
LAURA: Last time we ran into them, wasn't it on
the way to Kraghammer?

1202
01:15:19,437 --> 01:15:20,852
TALIESIN: From Westruun.

1203
01:15:20,852 --> 01:15:23,943
MARISHA: Odessa's mate is south of the
Frostweald.

1204
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:25,251
LAURA: I think it was.

1205
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:26,342
TRAVIS: Was it?

1206
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:29,200
LIAM: Yeah, it was. On the way to Kraghammer,
that's right.

1207
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,501
SAM: Is Frostweald near Kraghammer as well?

1208
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:32,879
LAURA: The Frostweald is--

1209
01:15:32,879 --> 01:15:34,207
MATT: South of Westruun.

1210
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:35,558
LAURA: South of Westruun, yes.

1211
01:15:35,558 --> 01:15:38,640
TALIESIN: So let's make our way to Westruun, I
suppose, then.

1212
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,556
SAM: And that's in the direction of both Grog's
herd and the Frostweald?

1213
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:45,473
LAURA: Potentially? Well, Grog would know.

1214
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,308
TRAVIS: What?

1215
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:50,074
LAURA: Cool. Yes, I think Grog really wants to
go.

1216
01:15:50,074 --> 01:15:51,680
SAM: Yeah, we should probably go there.

1217
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,627
LAURA: Yeah.

1218
01:15:52,627 --> 01:15:53,619
SAM: Let's do that.

1219
01:15:53,619 --> 01:15:59,116
MATT: Your herd wanders all across the Silvercut
Roadway, that whole area to the west of Westruun,

1220
01:15:59,116 --> 01:16:01,883
south of Kraghammer, east of Emon, that vicinity.

1221
01:16:01,883 --> 01:16:03,969
TRAVIS: They wander there.

1222
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:05,227
LAURA: Around there.

1223
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,168
TRAVIS: Yep.

1224
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:07,822
LAURA: Okay.

1225
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:16,964
TRAVIS: But look, I was thinking. It might be a
thing when we find them, right? So picture this.

1226
01:16:16,964 --> 01:16:26,845
Me, and then a lot of other me's, and they're all
really big and angry. So if we want to do anything

1227
01:16:26,845 --> 01:16:28,706
else before that happens--

1228
01:16:28,706 --> 01:16:32,966
SAM: You think they'll attack us? But we're with
you! You're our ally!

1229
01:16:32,966 --> 01:16:41,549
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'm a super cool, awesome, fun
guy, but we didn't really leave in the best terms.

1230
01:16:41,549 --> 01:16:42,934
LAURA: Oh, weren't you--

1231
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:47,874
TRAVIS: Ass-kicked, yeah. All left for dead,
pretty much.

1232
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:55,760
MARISHA: You know what, Grog, it's been a while.
Why exactly were you beat up and kicked out of

1233
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,180
your herd?

1234
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:03,875
TRAVIS: Right, so I was a bit younger, and we were
wandering through the woods, and we came upon this

1235
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:12,792
little old bearded thing, right? And he was
carrying groceries, like food and stuff, and

1236
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:18,044
everybody was a little hammered from boozing, and
they were like, hey, let's kill the little thing,

1237
01:17:18,044 --> 01:17:21,889
and we'll string him up and see what his insides
look like! And normally I'm like, yay, I'll wear

1238
01:17:21,889 --> 01:17:30,935
him as a hat! But he looked really sweet, and I
felt bad, so I said we shouldn't do that. And...

1239
01:17:30,935 --> 01:17:39,961
They didn't like that answer. My uncle in
particular, he didn't like that, so he made me

1240
01:17:39,961 --> 01:17:43,667
fight my cousin, his son.

1241
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,545
LAURA: And?

1242
01:17:45,545 --> 01:17:49,315
TRAVIS: That wasn't bad, I handled that. It was
not a problem.

1243
01:17:49,315 --> 01:17:53,368
MARISHA: Okay. So they might have a grudge about
that.

1244
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:58,105
TRAVIS: No, there's no grudge. They pretty much
think I'm dead, because after I whooped his son's

1245
01:17:58,105 --> 01:17:59,717
ass, he whooped my ass.

1246
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,239
LAURA: Oh.

1247
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:02,243
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1248
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,823
TALIESIN: We have a thing for that.

1249
01:18:03,823 --> 01:18:04,821
SAM: We do?

1250
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:06,501
TALIESIN: Can I borrow your hat?

1251
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:08,729
SAM: Of course you can borrow my hat.

1252
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:11,048
LAURA: The Hat of Disguise?

1253
01:18:11,048 --> 01:18:15,682
TALIESIN: If you don't want to have an immediate
confrontation with your family, there's no

1254
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:18,866
particular reason why they have to know you're
alive yet at all.

1255
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:24,319
SAM: You could wear this hat. Might not fit on
your head, you could maybe put it on one of your

1256
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:25,418
knuckles.

1257
01:18:25,418 --> 01:18:27,408
TRAVIS: I'm not hiding from my herd.

1258
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:32,590
TALIESIN: You were giving off the impression of
one who is looking forward to putting something off.

1259
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,230
TRAVIS: I was, was I?

1260
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:40,554
TALIESIN: You were. You're not anymore, as if
you've been dared, somehow.

1261
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:42,977
LAURA: Very big.

1262
01:18:42,977 --> 01:18:50,598
SAM: If you're too scared to do it, we can go
elsewhere. Sorry, I will never say that again.

1263
01:18:50,598 --> 01:19:07,986
TRAVIS: No, I'm excited to go. I want to go. We
should go. You know, what we need is the wolf.

1264
01:19:07,986 --> 01:19:09,457
LAURA: The wolf?

1265
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:10,862
TRAVIS: Yeah. We need--

1266
01:19:10,862 --> 01:19:12,336
LAURA: Oh, the wolf in Whitestone?

1267
01:19:12,336 --> 01:19:16,398
TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't they smell shit? He could help
us find them.

1268
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,750
LAURA: Well, Trinket can smell.

1269
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:22,124
MARISHA: And I can also theoretically turn into a
wolf to help us find things.

1270
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:28,014
TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to. I don't know how
long it's been since he's seen a she-wolf, so, you know.

1271
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,462
LIAM: Grog.

1272
01:19:30,462 --> 01:19:32,796
MARISHA: I was talking as in--

1273
01:19:32,796 --> 01:19:35,620
TRAVIS: I mean, it's very generous.

1274
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,205
LIAM: Just out of curiosity, we weren't going to
walk in and negotiate with your uncle. He's not

1275
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:45,266
going to give us these Knuckles. He's a proud
owner of them, yes?

1276
01:19:45,266 --> 01:19:46,580
TRAVIS: Yep.

1277
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,594
LIAM: And how many are in the herd, roughly?

1278
01:19:50,594 --> 01:19:55,004
TRAVIS: What's a number bigger than five?

1279
01:19:55,004 --> 01:19:56,181
LAURA: Six?

1280
01:19:56,181 --> 01:19:57,649
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like six.

1281
01:19:57,649 --> 01:20:05,173
MARISHA: You mean it's like at least six? Or
possibly more than six? How fast actually is the

1282
01:20:05,173 --> 01:20:08,771
reproduction process of goliaths?

1283
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:12,174
TALIESIN: Are there more people in your herd or
fingers on your hand?

1284
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:18,887
LIAM: I hold up Scanlan's hands and then I hold up
my hands behind them so that all 20 fingers are

1285
01:20:18,887 --> 01:20:23,972
waggling. Grog, are there more than this many in
your herd?

1286
01:20:23,972 --> 01:20:25,493
TRAVIS: Yeah, six.

1287
01:20:25,493 --> 01:20:26,643
LAURA: Okay.

1288
01:20:26,643 --> 01:20:28,226
TALIESIN: He's counting hands, not fingers.

1289
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:31,087
LAURA: Oh. I hold up mine, too.

1290
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:33,239
SAM: We all hold up our hands.

1291
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:34,563
LAURA: How many hands is that?

1292
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,773
LIAM: We're doing rakshasa hands. Grog, is there
more of them than rakshasa hands?

1293
01:20:37,773 --> 01:20:40,387
TRAVIS: That's closer, yeah. It's been a long
time.

1294
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:43,138
MARISHA: Yeah, this could be bad. This could be
bad.

1295
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:45,957
TALIESIN: We could attempt to steal them.

1296
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:49,976
LAURA: Steal from the goliaths? That could work.

1297
01:20:49,976 --> 01:20:51,342
MARISHA: How easy is that?

1298
01:20:51,342 --> 01:20:53,717
LAURA: Does he wear them all the time? Does he put
them in a chest?

1299
01:20:53,717 --> 01:20:55,668
TRAVIS: I mean, they're pretty smart, they're like
me.

1300
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:58,267
LAURA: Yeah. You're right.

1301
01:20:58,267 --> 01:21:03,283
LIAM: I don't think it's going to be pretty no
matter what we do, but I actually think trying to

1302
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:11,515
steal them might be a better angle than going
toe-to-toe with "six" goliaths. I just did air quotes.

1303
01:21:11,515 --> 01:21:13,265
LAURA: If six is the right number.

1304
01:21:13,265 --> 01:21:17,680
TRAVIS: Here's the thing, though. Normally, if you
try and steal something, or if you try and break

1305
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:24,479
the rules and you're like Keyleth and you get
arrested every time, arrested ain't so bad. They

1306
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:30,446
don't really arrest you. They, like, open you up
and use you as an appetizer.

1307
01:21:30,446 --> 01:21:32,415
LAURA: As a hat.

1308
01:21:32,415 --> 01:21:39,832
TRAVIS: Yeah. That was my thing, though. So I'm a
little nervous about that.

1309
01:21:39,832 --> 01:21:42,818
LIAM: We just have to pick the least terrible
option right now.

1310
01:21:42,818 --> 01:21:47,494
MARISHA: Well, we need these vestiges. We cannot
do anything without these vestiges.

1311
01:21:47,494 --> 01:21:52,639
SAM: It seems to me that no matter where we go, we
are putting ourselves in peril.

1312
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,150
TRAVIS: Yep.

1313
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:57,653
SAM: So it's really just a question of which peril
do we want to face first.

1314
01:21:57,653 --> 01:22:01,692
MARISHA: And don't we theoretically need the
vestiges before we go visit Odessa's boyfriend?

1315
01:22:01,692 --> 01:22:04,941
SAM: I thought Odessa's boyfriend had a vestige.

1316
01:22:04,941 --> 01:22:06,979
LAURA: No, he has locations of other vestiges.

1317
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:08,729
TRAVIS: Odessa? Osysa.

1318
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:09,829
MATT: Osysa.

1319
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:10,950
MARISHA: Sorry.

1320
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:14,325
TRAVIS: Shit, that's what I would call her.
Odessa.

1321
01:22:14,325 --> 01:22:24,760
LAURA: I feel like Pike would want to come with
us, Grog. You're very dear to her.

1322
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:31,266
MARISHA: But wasn't Pike and her grandfather the
reason?

1323
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:35,651
TRAVIS: It was Pike's grandfather, yeah. And plus,
she's a healer.

1324
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:40,340
TALIESIN: At the very least, let's make our way to
Westruun, then. Let's get that far and see what's--

1325
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:43,975
MARISHA: Well, remember Westruun is under dragons
right now.

1326
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:45,809
SAM: We can instantly transport anywhere.

1327
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:48,246
LAURA: You know of trees outside of Westruun?

1328
01:22:48,246 --> 01:22:53,668
MARISHA: I can, but it's under dragon reign. In
fact, isn't that where Raishan stopped off?

1329
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:59,363
MATT: No, the scrying that you saw was Umbrasyl,
the black dragon, that took up residence, it

1330
01:22:59,363 --> 01:23:06,420
seems, in Gatshadow, the mountain north of
Westruun, at the base of the Cloudkeep mountain range.

1331
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,285
LAURA: And Gatshadow is where Grog got his scar,
right?

1332
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:10,703
MATT: Yep, that's where you guys initially... that
happened.

1333
01:23:10,703 --> 01:23:20,512
TRAVIS: All right. Fuck. Look, if there's a lot of
them, and only a handful of us, it's not usually

1334
01:23:20,512 --> 01:23:28,446
customary to have two sides go at each other. If
we want those Knuckles, I'm pretty sure it might

1335
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:38,373
have to be one on one. Now, I know I can totally
take my uncle. But I wouldn't mind if we found a

1336
01:23:38,373 --> 01:23:46,517
few extra-credit items before we did that just in
case I have the flu that morning, or it burns when

1337
01:23:46,517 --> 01:23:49,480
I pee. Just something to take the edge off.

1338
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,048
SAM: So sphinx first.

1339
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:53,977
TRAVIS: If that's what you want to do, then yeah!

1340
01:23:53,977 --> 01:23:55,928
SAM: Say no more.

1341
01:23:55,928 --> 01:24:01,291
MARISHA: Okay. And did we also want to check out
the Cobalt Reserve which was in Westruun, or did

1342
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,345
Allura already handle that and we're cool?

1343
01:24:03,345 --> 01:24:05,015
LAURA: Allura, I think, handled that, right? You
saw her.

1344
01:24:05,015 --> 01:24:10,333
MARISHA: She was there and it looked pretty
trashed. It looked like she grabbed a lot of the

1345
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,017
last of the good things.

1346
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:15,906
SAM: All right. Let's go to the sphinx, then.
Where's that? The Frostweald, we've been there.

1347
01:24:15,906 --> 01:24:17,837
LAURA: Yes, we have been to the Frostweald.

1348
01:24:17,837 --> 01:24:19,349
SAM: Do you remember any trees there?

1349
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:22,946
LAURA: Frostweald is where Grog mugged down with
the nymph, right?

1350
01:24:22,946 --> 01:24:25,057
LIAM: Allegedly.

1351
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:26,147
LAURA: Allegedly.

1352
01:24:26,147 --> 01:24:27,398
SAM: We'll never know.

1353
01:24:27,398 --> 01:24:29,101
TRAVIS: Grog does not kiss and tell.

1354
01:24:29,101 --> 01:24:30,048
LAURA: Yes, you do.

1355
01:24:30,048 --> 01:24:31,113
TRAVIS: All the time.

1356
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:33,051
LIAM: All the time. All the time.

1357
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:36,516
MARISHA: Just not that one time that we want to
actually know.

1358
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:37,764
SAM: Let's go to the Frostweald.

1359
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:38,824
LAURA: Let's do it!

1360
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,161
SAM: Do you remember any trees?

1361
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,661
MARISHA: Do I remember any trees?

1362
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:46,640
MATT: At the time, because you were not
specifically paying attention to this ability of

1363
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:55,208
yours, there is no specific tree that has caught
your attention. You could attempt to make an

1364
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:59,308
intelligence roll.

1365
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:08,072
MARISHA: Not my strong suit. A straight
intelligence check? Nine.

1366
01:25:08,072 --> 01:25:14,203
MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, you can't recall the
specific location of any trees in the Frostweald.

1367
01:25:14,203 --> 01:25:17,726
It's been a long time since then, and you weren't
being conscious of it at the time.

1368
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:21,304
MARISHA: It's been a few years, you guys.

1369
01:25:21,304 --> 01:25:24,679
TALIESIN: All trees look the same, don't they?

1370
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:26,126
MARISHA: After a while.

1371
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,380
TALIESIN: Say it. All trees look the same.

1372
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,385
LIAM: All right. Everybody hop on Vex's broom.

1373
01:25:30,385 --> 01:25:33,856
LAURA: I mean, we could try.

1374
01:25:33,856 --> 01:25:39,164
MARISHA: I could get us close, or I could scry and
look for a tree.

1375
01:25:39,164 --> 01:25:40,857
MATT: If you would like to, yeah.

1376
01:25:40,857 --> 01:25:42,931
MARISHA: Can I take time to do that?

1377
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:48,167
MATT: If you want to, yeah. The trees in the area
that you would know, that you recall, there was

1378
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:54,937
a... There were trees based around the Crossroads,
which is the middle point of the Silvercut roadway

1379
01:25:54,937 --> 01:26:00,188
that's even further northwest, and west of
Westruun. There's the Bramblewood Forest, which is

1380
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:10,289
just north of Westruun. Most of them would be
further west from there. Those are the closest.

1381
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:15,004
MARISHA: The closest destination. Would the
Crossroads be good? Maybe get us to the

1382
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:16,254
Crossroads?

1383
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,576
SAM: Or we could just go to Westruun. Is Westruun
still there?

1384
01:26:19,576 --> 01:26:22,643
LAURA: Westruun's under dragon rule. There's an
actual dragon on Westruun.

1385
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:26,286
MATT: Not on. Up in the mountain, but watching
down, probably.

1386
01:26:26,286 --> 01:26:29,973
MARISHA: But they've got wyverns policing, right,
in Westruun?

1387
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:32,180
MATT: You didn't notice in your scry.

1388
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:37,088
MARISHA: I'm going to assume. Let's do the
Crossroads.

1389
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:38,575
LAURA: Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it!

1390
01:26:38,575 --> 01:26:41,713
MARISHA: We could theoretically run into your
herd, though.

1391
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:43,044
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I hope we do.

1392
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:44,600
LAURA: Yeah.

1393
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,683
MARISHA: To the Crossroads!

1394
01:26:47,683 --> 01:26:57,649
MATT: Okay. So you're going to the Crossroads. The
Crossroads is about two days of travel northeast

1395
01:26:57,649 --> 01:27:00,727
of the Frostweald, about three days' travel.

1396
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:04,549
MARISHA: So I would be going northeast from the
Crossroads? Or if I wanted to go in the

1397
01:27:04,549 --> 01:27:08,840
Bramblewood I would have to southwest to get to
the Frostweald?

1398
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:16,281
MATT: Here we go. This is the Frostweald. This is
Westruun. This is the Crossroads. This is Emon.

1399
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:18,012
This is Kraghammer.

1400
01:27:18,012 --> 01:27:19,600
LAURA: Oh shit.

1401
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,561
MARISHA: Where's the Bramble forest?

1402
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:26,168
MATT: It's right here. It's by Westruun. The
Crossroads is over here. You can totally take the

1403
01:27:26,168 --> 01:27:27,454
Crossroads, but it'll be--

1404
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:28,760
LAURA: Go to the forest.

1405
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,407
MARISHA: Let's go to the forest. Let's go to the
Bramblewood forest.

1406
01:27:30,407 --> 01:27:31,974
MATT: Bramblewood forest? Okay, that's fine.

1407
01:27:31,974 --> 01:27:37,130
MARISHA: There's got to be some big trees there. I
remember a few big trees. I remember admiring a

1408
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,004
few big trees in the Bramblewood forest.

1409
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:43,013
MATT: Because you spent a lot of time in Westruun,
specifically, you do recall various locations. You

1410
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:46,922
take a moment to concentrate on a few trees
actually within Westruun. You recall there was one

1411
01:27:46,922 --> 01:27:50,728
that was near a playground where you had once
interrogated a small child if they had seen--

1412
01:27:50,728 --> 01:27:54,329
TALIESIN: Yeah! I remember that!

1413
01:27:54,329 --> 01:27:56,060
SAM: We spent a whole day in that park.

1414
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:02,895
MATT: Yep. You begin to cast the spell and you
concentrate on that tree in the park. There's no

1415
01:28:02,895 --> 01:28:06,853
connection to the tree. You gather that the tree
may not have survived the initial attack on

1416
01:28:06,853 --> 01:28:13,409
Westruun. However, you do take a moment and you do
recall at the entrance to the Bramblewood, when

1417
01:28:13,409 --> 01:28:17,528
you guys were briefly attacked by that group of
thieves that were pulling you off to the side,

1418
01:28:17,528 --> 01:28:20,335
pretending to be a stranded caravan.

1419
01:28:20,335 --> 01:28:22,741
MARISHA: That was good.

1420
01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:29,443
MATT: There was a series of rather large trees
that marked the roadway there, and you recall one

1421
01:28:29,443 --> 01:28:36,116
that had distinct markings, and you do manage to
find a point of concentration or connection there.

1422
01:28:36,116 --> 01:28:39,901
MARISHA: I guess it took me a moment to find
signal. Okay. All right. We're good.

1423
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:41,250
SAM: You need a signal boost.

1424
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,500
MARISHA: I think I got one.

1425
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,930
MATT: You complete the spell against one of the
petrified trees on the outside of the Cindergrove.

1426
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:51,523
The doorway opens up, and you guys can see a
thicket of Bramblewood trees on the opposite side.

1427
01:28:51,523 --> 01:28:57,043
You all rush through one after the other, Trinket
jumping behind. You all make it through, and

1428
01:28:57,043 --> 01:29:05,314
you're now standing on the central pathway of the
Bramblewood. Further south, you're probably about

1429
01:29:05,314 --> 01:29:09,656
an hour and a half foot travel before you exit the
southern portion of the forest.

1430
01:29:09,656 --> 01:29:13,150
MARISHA: All right, sorry, guys, this is as close
as I could get us.

1431
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:14,329
LAURA: No, this is great!

1432
01:29:14,329 --> 01:29:16,594
SAM: And how far are we now? A day's travel? Two
days' travel, you said?

1433
01:29:16,594 --> 01:29:29,539
MATT: To the Frostweald? You're about a day and a
half. On horseback you're about a day, under a

1434
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:32,799
day. On foot, you're looking at about two days'
travel, a little over two days' travel.

1435
01:29:32,799 --> 01:29:34,343
SAM and LAURA: Ugh.

1436
01:29:34,343 --> 01:29:36,014
MATT: That's a rapid pace.

1437
01:29:36,014 --> 01:29:37,451
MARISHA: Mist form.

1438
01:29:37,451 --> 01:29:39,465
TRAVIS: Or we go where?

1439
01:29:39,465 --> 01:29:41,105
MARISHA: We could be clouds.

1440
01:29:41,105 --> 01:29:42,668
SAM: We're not very fast in mist form, are we?

1441
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:43,699
LAURA: No, we are, we're super fast.

1442
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:44,622
SAM: Are we?

1443
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:45,612
MATT: You're fast in mist form.

1444
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:47,814
MARISHA: How long would it take to get us in mist
form?

1445
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:53,521
MATT: It would be a little bit faster than a
horse.

1446
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:55,610
SAM: Like a day.

1447
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:58,914
MARISHA: Should we turn into clouds and go?

1448
01:29:58,914 --> 01:30:01,110
SAM: I haven't done this before. Is it freaky?

1449
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,769
LAURA: I pop Trinket back into his little
crystal.

1450
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:04,972
SAM: Is it super freaky?

1451
01:30:04,972 --> 01:30:07,370
TALIESIN: It's so super freaky.

1452
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:11,120
SAM: All right.

1453
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:16,365
LAURA: Percy, what if instead of a seat, what if
it was like I was straddling it, and there were

1454
01:30:16,365 --> 01:30:18,610
two little things like footholds?

1455
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:20,456
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, do you want to design this?

1456
01:30:20,456 --> 01:30:21,818
LAURA: No, no, it's up to you. It's totally you.

1457
01:30:21,818 --> 01:30:22,894
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

1458
01:30:22,894 --> 01:30:24,518
LAURA: I was just coming up with ideas to help you
out.

1459
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:27,505
TALIESIN: You're welcome to design this, it's just
going to be much more expensive.

1460
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,597
LAURA: No, no, it's all you. It's all you.

1461
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:32,216
MATT: So, Keyleth, what are you doing? Are you
doing the--

1462
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:36,929
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm picking my spells because I
haven't done that yet, but yeah. We'll poof!

1463
01:30:36,929 --> 01:30:41,749
MATT: So Keyleth goes ahead and casts-- Is it Wind
Walk?

1464
01:30:41,749 --> 01:30:42,994
MARISHA: Wind Walk.

1465
01:30:42,994 --> 01:30:49,486
MATT: All of you guys take a moment to transform
into a mist form, and you all begin to coast right

1466
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:56,897
around the top of the trees, making your way south
to the back of the Bramblewood. As soon as you

1467
01:30:56,897 --> 01:31:03,486
exit the top of the trees, you can see Westruun
ahead of you, and there are a number of

1468
01:31:03,486 --> 01:31:09,148
interesting things that catch your attention. First
and foremost, you see, halfway between the

1469
01:31:09,148 --> 01:31:14,911
treetops to the south end of the forest and the
very north part of Westruun, there appears to be a

1470
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:21,975
large, green open field with thicker patches of
grassland here and there. There is a section that

1471
01:31:21,975 --> 01:31:30,476
is a grassless dirt mound, that has, as you start
coasting over you can see, what looks like spikes

1472
01:31:30,476 --> 01:31:37,980
of wood, a couple of things that glimmer in the
light as you pass over, and what looks like large

1473
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:46,018
grooves dug in a haphazard pattern. This patch is
about 15 or 20 feet across, and you see two people

1474
01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:48,317
bringing a cart away from it.

1475
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:52,588
LAURA: Can we mist down a little closer to get a
better view of what it is?

1476
01:31:52,588 --> 01:31:55,610
MATT: Yeah. These wispy people-clouds (wind).

1477
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:58,738
TALIESIN: Those clouds look like half-elves!

1478
01:31:58,738 --> 01:32:09,878
MATT: No one seems to pay mind. The two
individuals that went away with the cart are a

1479
01:32:09,878 --> 01:32:14,638
little far from what you can see at this point,
but they both appear to be humanoid, in no

1480
01:32:14,638 --> 01:32:20,564
particular rush but they're hauling this large
cart away. As you look, you can see in this patch

1481
01:32:20,564 --> 01:32:26,972
of dirt, the glimmers that you saw was a
smattering of gold and silver coins that appear to

1482
01:32:26,972 --> 01:32:32,240
have been tossed into this pile. It looks like
there are pieces of wood that have been broken and

1483
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:40,326
crushed in the giant grooves. Who's taking the
intense look at this one right now? Okay, so the

1484
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,923
two of you, I want you to roll investigation
checks.

1485
01:32:42,923 --> 01:32:47,192
TALIESIN: 18.

1486
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:51,194
LAURA: Wow. No, 16 for me.

1487
01:32:51,194 --> 01:32:57,186
MATT: You recognize, and you get a feel for it
too, because of your specialty in this, you notice

1488
01:32:57,186 --> 01:33:05,318
that the giant grooves that tear into this are
actually sweeping claw marks, like something of a

1489
01:33:05,318 --> 01:33:11,737
large size and a very fast speed came down, and
has come down multiple times, to snatch up

1490
01:33:11,737 --> 01:33:14,116
something that was placed in this location.

1491
01:33:14,116 --> 01:33:16,709
LAURA: Oh, this is where they make their
offerings.

1492
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:18,265
TALIESIN: This is where the offerings are made.

1493
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:24,555
LAURA: That's good to know. I have advantage on
anything having to do with dragons.

1494
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:29,039
MATT: Right, which, as you're seeing this now,
yeah, you would gather the information with him as

1495
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:33,263
you did. Do you guys continue southward?

1496
01:33:33,263 --> 01:33:35,055
MARISHA: Yeah.

1497
01:33:35,055 --> 01:33:36,466
MATT: Coasting on the outskirts of the city?

1498
01:33:36,466 --> 01:33:38,063
LAURA: It's good to know that that's there,
though.

1499
01:33:38,063 --> 01:33:39,640
TRAVIS: We could set an ambush later.

1500
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,757
LAURA: Yeah!

1501
01:33:40,757 --> 01:33:45,686
MATT: You guys begin to coast around the outside
of Westruun, drifting up above as well, this wispy

1502
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:54,370
pattern of clouds. You get a view of the external
farmlands that dot the north-northwestern side of

1503
01:33:54,370 --> 01:34:02,219
Westruun. A number of them appear to have been
burned. Not like forest fire or cataclysmic

1504
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:08,732
meteorite, like intentionally burned. The crops
are charred and black, and there's a pattern to

1505
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:15,704
how that was set. A few farmhouses also appear to
have burned as well. But there are farmlands that

1506
01:34:15,704 --> 01:34:21,702
are also functional, and you can see people
tilling the land. I want everyone to make a

1507
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:23,322
perception check.

1508
01:34:23,322 --> 01:34:24,212
TRAVIS: A what?

1509
01:34:24,212 --> 01:34:25,652
LAURA: Perception.

1510
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:30,563
TRAVIS: 14.

1511
01:34:30,563 --> 01:34:33,445
MARISHA: 16.

1512
01:34:33,445 --> 01:34:34,494
TALIESIN: 18.

1513
01:34:34,494 --> 01:34:35,554
SAM: Three!

1514
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:36,480
LAURA: 31.

1515
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,031
LIAM: 22.

1516
01:34:38,031 --> 01:34:48,892
MATT: Okay, so people above 20 would be the twins.
All right, so Vex and Vax, you guys look over

1517
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:57,013
these fields and two things you notice. One, each
set of farmers that are working, there is a

1518
01:34:57,013 --> 01:35:03,653
well-armed individual on the outskirts of each of
these farms that is intently watching them work.

1519
01:35:03,653 --> 01:35:09,381
As you're paying attention to this, one of them
walks over and starts screaming at one and pushes

1520
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:18,482
them over, and then stands back and keeps guard.
You also notice that the outside of the city,

1521
01:35:18,482 --> 01:35:24,971
there appears to be some sort of construct or
battlements, almost like another wall, a very thin

1522
01:35:24,971 --> 01:35:27,907
wall, has been built around the various entrances
to the city.

1523
01:35:27,907 --> 01:35:32,093
LAURA: They've imprisoned the people. We can't
talk to each other.

1524
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:34,830
MATT: Can't talk to each other, no, not in mist
form.

1525
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:37,021
TALIESIN: Just vape at each other.

1526
01:35:37,021 --> 01:35:45,910
TRAVIS: Do we keep going, or do we-- Somebody make
a choice. Down or keep going?

1527
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:49,781
LAURA: I don't know what good we'll do right now.

1528
01:35:49,781 --> 01:35:52,626
MARISHA: Can't do anything right now.

1529
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,493
TALIESIN: You're the only two that have noticed.

1530
01:35:54,493 --> 01:35:56,439
MATT: It's up to you guys. Do you guys want to go
investigate, or do you want to keep going south?

1531
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:58,838
LAURA: I mean, how many guards are there around
there?

1532
01:35:58,838 --> 01:36:03,901
MATT: You only see two that are actually in the
immediate farmland, and they're quite a walk away

1533
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:07,777
from the actual city. They don't appear to be on
heavy lockdown.

1534
01:36:07,777 --> 01:36:14,796
LIAM: As wind, I'll pull in front of my sister and
use windiness and wind hands and wind farts to put

1535
01:36:14,796 --> 01:36:22,591
up a stop sign with my hands and point down if
that's possible in this form.

1536
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:27,744
MATT: Yeah, that's possible in the form. Vex, you
see Vax, your brother, stop in front of you, put

1537
01:36:27,744 --> 01:36:29,822
his hands up, and point downward with his hands.

1538
01:36:29,822 --> 01:36:37,161
LAURA: What do you want to do? What do you want? I
noticed it too.

1539
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:38,985
TALIESIN: I float on over to this.

1540
01:36:38,985 --> 01:36:45,277
LIAM: I'm going to go down and I'm going to motion
for her to follow.

1541
01:36:45,277 --> 01:36:46,837
TALIESIN: All right, going down.

1542
01:36:46,837 --> 01:36:47,878
MATT: You guys all follow?

1543
01:36:47,878 --> 01:36:49,088
TALIESIN: I'll solidify on the ground.

1544
01:36:49,088 --> 01:36:52,756
SAM: I'm still thinking about, what were those big
gashes in the ground back there?

1545
01:36:52,756 --> 01:36:56,680
MATT: Yeah, it was really confusing to you. All
right, you guys all drift down towards the ground

1546
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:00,890
as you see Vax begin to take on physical form on
the outskirts.

1547
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,863
LAURA: Oh, shit. Can we stealth? As we come out of
it, I want to cast Pass Without a Trace

1548
01:37:03,863 --> 01:37:04,974
immediately.

1549
01:37:04,974 --> 01:37:09,214
MATT: Okay. Are you going down to the burnt
farmland or one of the healthy farms?

1550
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:13,010
LAURA: Can we go down in an area that there's
shadow, to where we're hidden?

1551
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:16,192
MATT: There are a few of the fields that are more
high crop, corn-style stalks.

1552
01:37:16,192 --> 01:37:18,169
LAURA: Somewhere that when we take form, we'll be
hidden.

1553
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:19,362
TRAVIS: Just you two, right?

1554
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:20,172
LAURA: I don't know.

1555
01:37:20,172 --> 01:37:21,015
TALIESIN: I'm going down, too.

1556
01:37:21,015 --> 01:37:21,884
TRAVIS: You three?

1557
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:25,562
MATT: Okay. Percy, Vax, and Vex all take a moment
to revert back to their physical form.

1558
01:37:25,562 --> 01:37:28,713
SAM: Oh, I'm reverting, too. I'm a follower.

1559
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:30,573
MATT: All right, Scanlan. Keyleth?

1560
01:37:30,573 --> 01:37:32,880
MARISHA: I guess so.

1561
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:37,495
TRAVIS: Wow, we're just going to make this super
obvious, huh? There are dragons flying overhead.

1562
01:37:37,495 --> 01:37:40,510
TALIESIN: Well, we've landed.

1563
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,831
MARISHA: We're in a corn field.

1564
01:37:41,831 --> 01:37:44,693
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've landed. Let's do it. We all
want to die.

1565
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:49,508
MATT: All right, so all of you, including Grog, or
are you staying in your mist form?

1566
01:37:49,508 --> 01:37:52,369
TRAVIS: Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm changing.

1567
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:55,677
MATT: You all take a moment to revert to your
physical form. I would like everyone to make a

1568
01:37:55,677 --> 01:37:56,877
stealth check.

1569
01:37:56,877 --> 01:37:58,880
LAURA: And I cast Pass Without a Trace, so it's
extra ten.

1570
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,596
MARISHA: Ooh! Natural 19.

1571
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:05,518
TRAVIS: Hey, 18!

1572
01:38:05,518 --> 01:38:09,629
LAURA: 32.

1573
01:38:09,629 --> 01:38:10,945
LIAM: 25.

1574
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:12,912
LAURA: Add ten!

1575
01:38:12,912 --> 01:38:14,538
LIAM: 35!

1576
01:38:14,538 --> 01:38:16,141
TALIESIN: 31.

1577
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:17,039
SAM: 29.

1578
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:18,048
MARISHA: 36.

1579
01:38:18,048 --> 01:38:19,059
SAM: We're all good.

1580
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:19,985
TRAVIS: 28.

1581
01:38:19,985 --> 01:38:21,274
MATT: What did you get again?

1582
01:38:21,274 --> 01:38:22,198
LAURA: 32.

1583
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:23,623
TALIESIN: You don't know we're here anymore.

1584
01:38:23,623 --> 01:38:32,677
MATT: Where'd the party go? You all begin to weave
your way through the various lines of high-stalk

1585
01:38:32,677 --> 01:38:37,849
crop. Where are you heading? Are you heading in
towards the city, or are you heading

1586
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:38,915
towards the farmers?

1587
01:38:38,915 --> 01:38:43,650
LAURA: We just want to sit here for a minute and
talk about it. Can we just say, so here's the

1588
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:49,030
thing. Those guards are attacking the farmers. I'm
pretty sure they're using slave labor at this

1589
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:57,082
point. Kind of like you, Scanlan! Slave labor to
provide food for the city. Vax really wanted to

1590
01:38:57,082 --> 01:39:01,974
stop down, but the thing is, if we kill the guards
and set the farmers free, everybody in the city

1591
01:39:01,974 --> 01:39:04,628
might starve. It's a tough situation right now.

1592
01:39:04,628 --> 01:39:07,748
TALIESIN: Or they might just send more guards,
once they know that one's been killed, and then

1593
01:39:07,748 --> 01:39:09,270
kill everybody involved.

1594
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:14,440
LAURA: I'm afraid right now I don't know what all
we can do in this town until we can defeat the

1595
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,662
dragon, which unfortunately is rather close.

1596
01:39:17,662 --> 01:39:19,298
MARISHA: It's a bigger problem.

1597
01:39:19,298 --> 01:39:22,742
TALIESIN: We can't do anything for them right now
until we actually know what's happening.

1598
01:39:22,742 --> 01:39:26,392
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you can see there's a slight rustle, and a

1599
01:39:26,392 --> 01:39:32,037
farmer comes across, carrying a small satchel as
he's picking things off of one of the nearby areas.

1600
01:39:32,037 --> 01:39:33,636
TRAVIS: Is he close to us?

1601
01:39:33,636 --> 01:39:35,219
MATT: About 15 feet from you.

1602
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,242
MARISHA: Does he see us?

1603
01:39:36,242 --> 01:39:37,567
MATT: He doesn't seem to notice you guys.

1604
01:39:37,567 --> 01:39:40,977
LAURA: I mean, we can tell him to hold out hope.

1605
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:43,913
TALIESIN: Maybe he knows what's going on.

1606
01:39:43,913 --> 01:39:48,365
LAURA: He could also be one of the assholes that's
serving the dragon, just like people in Emon.

1607
01:39:48,365 --> 01:39:55,445
TRAVIS: I go (clicks).

1608
01:39:55,445 --> 01:40:02,210
MATT: The farmer turns. (gasps) You now see him.
It's a man in his late 40s, early 50s, gray beard.

1609
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:05,514
TRAVIS: Shh! Help me out. Shh.

1610
01:40:05,514 --> 01:40:06,490
MATT: "Yeah..."

1611
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:07,419
TRAVIS: Shh!

1612
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:08,470
LAURA: Act natural!

1613
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:09,401
TRAVIS: Keep picking!

1614
01:40:09,401 --> 01:40:10,601
LAURA: Keep picking!

1615
01:40:10,601 --> 01:40:12,005
MATT: He keeps picking.

1616
01:40:12,005 --> 01:40:16,992
LAURA: Hey, you. Do you like the dragon or do you
not like the dragon?

1617
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:21,378
TALIESIN: In the interest of the internet, we
should probably do stage whispers.

1618
01:40:21,378 --> 01:40:23,769
LAURA: Do you like the dragon or do you not like
the dragon?

1619
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:30,084
MATT: You can see there's some heavy bruising on
his face and part of his cheek is swollen. He

1620
01:40:30,084 --> 01:40:36,114
goes, "It would be hard around these parts to find
someone who likes a dragon, let alone that one."

1621
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:37,333
LAURA: Good.

1622
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:40,017
MATT: "Not the worst of the worries right now,
though."

1623
01:40:40,017 --> 01:40:41,280
LAURA: What's the worst?

1624
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,503
MATT: "The ones who work for him."

1625
01:40:43,503 --> 01:40:49,768
LAURA: Right. So you have to provide food for
everybody living in the city? Is that how that goes?

1626
01:40:49,768 --> 01:40:55,580
MATT: "Every one of them. Otherwise they just go
ahead and steal from whoever's nearby. Isn't a

1627
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:58,189
"caravan that's made their way past Westruun in the
past week."

1628
01:40:58,189 --> 01:41:09,409
LAURA: Well, here's the thing. We're trying to
help you. We're trying to find a way to (clicking)

1629
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:16,625
(choking) kill the fucks. You get me? Ill-kay the
agons-dray.

1630
01:41:16,625 --> 01:41:19,868
MATT: Drops the fruit he has in his hand. "Please!
Please help us, please!"

1631
01:41:19,868 --> 01:41:28,308
LAURA: Act natural! Keep picking, keep picking, keep
picking! We want to help you. We really, really,

1632
01:41:28,308 --> 01:41:29,902
really want to help you.

1633
01:41:29,902 --> 01:41:31,178
MATT: "They have my daughter."

1634
01:41:31,178 --> 01:41:32,174
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1635
01:41:32,174 --> 01:41:33,082
TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

1636
01:41:33,082 --> 01:41:34,410
SAM: Who has your daughter?

1637
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:35,754
TALIESIN: No daughters right now.

1638
01:41:35,754 --> 01:41:37,430
MATT: "Those beasts."

1639
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:38,982
SAM: Beasts? What beasts?

1640
01:41:38,982 --> 01:41:41,484
LAURA: The guards? They're keeping your daughter?

1641
01:41:41,484 --> 01:41:43,361
MATT: "Keeping a lot of people."

1642
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:45,002
TRAVIS: Do you know where they keep them?

1643
01:41:45,002 --> 01:41:48,821
MATT: He leans over, nudges towards the direction
of the city.

1644
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:51,899
TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

1645
01:41:51,899 --> 01:41:53,996
MATT: "I don't know his name."

1646
01:41:53,996 --> 01:42:00,115
SAM: And that spot that we saw, just outside of
town, that's where gold is given to the dragon? Do

1647
01:42:00,115 --> 01:42:01,866
you know anything of that?

1648
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:05,316
MATT: He looks a little confused. "I don't know.
They just take what we have."

1649
01:42:05,316 --> 01:42:08,597
LIAM: The guy, you don't know his name. What does
he look like? Where have you seen him?

1650
01:42:08,597 --> 01:42:10,336
LAURA: Keep your voice down!

1651
01:42:10,336 --> 01:42:15,674
LIAM: I'm talking through Skype, so it's a little
more difficult for me!

1652
01:42:15,674 --> 01:42:18,916
MATT: Who are you talking about?

1653
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:27,534
LIAM: The guy who's got your child. You don't know
his name. What does he look like? Where have you

1654
01:42:27,534 --> 01:42:28,870
seen him?

1655
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:33,407
MATT: "I don't know. They're all different types,
I haven't seen the one who has them. They have them."

1656
01:42:33,407 --> 01:42:36,587
LAURA: They, the guards? The people that serve the
dragon?

1657
01:42:36,587 --> 01:42:40,227
MARISHA: What type of people are they interested
in?

1658
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:47,406
MATT: "Half-orcs-- Interested in? Whoever keeps
him at bay. I don't know, they take whoever seems

1659
01:42:47,406 --> 01:42:51,891
"useful. Sometimes they take them and slaughter
them before us as a warning."

1660
01:42:51,891 --> 01:42:53,670
MARISHA: Then why did they take your daughter?

1661
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,513
MATT: "I don't want to think about it."

1662
01:42:55,513 --> 01:42:56,964
LAURA: To keep him working!

1663
01:42:56,964 --> 01:43:02,321
TRAVIS: Look. Say we were really bored, and we
wanted to get you your family back.

1664
01:43:02,321 --> 01:43:04,590
Where would you go?

1665
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:14,580
MATT: He points over to the city. "But there's one
right out..." And you see him pointing angrily

1666
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:18,586
around the corner, probably to the one that you
saw on the outskirts of the farm area you guys

1667
01:43:18,586 --> 01:43:20,111
came down in.

1668
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:23,134
TALIESIN: Let's go to the city then, I suppose.

1669
01:43:23,134 --> 01:43:24,038
SAM: Wait, what?

1670
01:43:24,038 --> 01:43:25,146
LAURA: There's a dragon!

1671
01:43:25,146 --> 01:43:28,049
SAM: To do what, to attack half-orcs that work for
a dragon?

1672
01:43:28,049 --> 01:43:29,780
LAURA: Farmer. What's your name?

1673
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,179
MATT: "Reginald."

1674
01:43:31,179 --> 01:43:36,657
LAURA: Reginald. Reginald, we want to help. How
often do you see the dragon flying around?

1675
01:43:36,657 --> 01:43:40,845
MATT: "Once every couple days, maybe."

1676
01:43:40,845 --> 01:43:43,459
LAURA: Once every couple days. When was the last
time you saw him?

1677
01:43:43,459 --> 01:43:52,728
MATT: "About half a day ago. Dusk yesterday. I
don't know. We all stay inside around that time

1678
01:43:52,728 --> 01:43:54,020
"just in case."

1679
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,231
MARISHA: Does he have patrols? Does he have
wyverns working for him as well, that fly around?

1680
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:04,440
MATT: "I haven't seen anything flying but the
dragon. There was a huge fight not more than a

1681
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,510
"week ago between these people and that thing. They
seem to have come to an accord."

1682
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:11,026
MARISHA: These people?

1683
01:44:11,026 --> 01:44:12,553
SAM: The orcs?

1684
01:44:12,553 --> 01:44:19,169
MATT: "The orcs, the whatever they are. The big
strong angry ones that keep taking all of our stuff."

1685
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:21,219
MARISHA: Oh, no.

1686
01:44:21,219 --> 01:44:22,706
LAURA: (gasps)

1687
01:44:22,706 --> 01:44:25,435
SAM: What, what?

1688
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:26,576
LAURA: What do they look like?

1689
01:44:26,576 --> 01:44:28,466
MARISHA: Do they look like him, maybe?

1690
01:44:28,466 --> 01:44:29,394
MATT: "Some do."

1691
01:44:29,394 --> 01:44:30,904
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me.

1692
01:44:30,904 --> 01:44:35,343
LAURA: Shit.

1693
01:44:35,343 --> 01:44:39,068
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1694
01:44:39,068 --> 01:44:46,686
MATT: "The dragon came in and tore everything
down."

1695
01:44:46,686 --> 01:44:50,008
TRAVIS: Damn it. Shit hammer.

1696
01:44:50,008 --> 01:44:56,735
MATT: "Burned, liquefied, dissolved portions of
this city, people screaming. And then it left.

1697
01:44:56,735 --> 01:44:58,691
"Both of them."

1698
01:44:58,691 --> 01:45:04,384
SAM: You'll be okay. We're going to keep going.
Good luck.

1699
01:45:04,384 --> 01:45:05,593
TRAVIS: No, wait, wait.

1700
01:45:05,593 --> 01:45:06,675
LAURA: Scanlan!

1701
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:10,905
SAM: No, we have to keep going. We can't face
these goliaths and dragons and orc guards!

1702
01:45:10,905 --> 01:45:12,576
This is craziness!

1703
01:45:12,576 --> 01:45:14,358
MARISHA: One of the dragons was green?

1704
01:45:14,358 --> 01:45:16,830
MATT: "From what we saw."

1705
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:17,936
LAURA: Green and a black.

1706
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:21,547
MATT: "Green and a black. I think a white one, but
that one kept going.

1707
01:45:21,547 --> 01:45:23,102
SAM: I mean, we'll be fine.

1708
01:45:23,102 --> 01:45:24,622
MARISHA: And the green one kept going?

1709
01:45:24,622 --> 01:45:32,165
MATT: "All of them kept going. We thought we were
safe. We tried to re-gather. And then, within a

1710
01:45:32,226 --> 01:45:40,565
"day, a bunch of these bastards came and took what
was left. Slaughtering, stealing."

1711
01:45:40,565 --> 01:45:49,673
TRAVIS: We've got to go get his kid.

1712
01:45:49,673 --> 01:45:52,496
LAURA: I feel like we have to help them. We have
to help them!

1713
01:45:52,496 --> 01:45:59,638
MARISHA: Oh man. I feel like you all are talking
like I normally do, and I'm talking like Grog

1714
01:45:59,638 --> 01:46:01,944
normally does. This is such a weird day.

1715
01:46:01,944 --> 01:46:04,297
SAM: No, you're using way too many prepositions.

1716
01:46:04,297 --> 01:46:07,119
TRAVIS: You said there are a lot of people that
look like me.

1717
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:14,980
MATT: "From what I've seen. I don't go too far
into town, they keep me out here, but I've seen a few."

1718
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:18,005
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for the guard. I
want to keep an eye out for the guard, make sure

1719
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:19,110
he's not noticing.

1720
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:20,103
MATT: Perception check.

1721
01:46:20,103 --> 01:46:21,386
TRAVIS: They're in the city?

1722
01:46:21,386 --> 01:46:22,555
MATT: "Most of them are, yeah."

1723
01:46:22,555 --> 01:46:24,586
SAM: Were there six of them?

1724
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:27,392
LAURA: 17.

1725
01:46:27,392 --> 01:46:30,430
MATT: 17, okay. You don't see the guard nearby.

1726
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:31,759
TRAVIS: We need that guard.

1727
01:46:31,759 --> 01:46:34,828
MARISHA: What are we going to do right now?

1728
01:46:34,828 --> 01:46:36,513
TRAVIS: We're going to ask him some questions.

1729
01:46:36,513 --> 01:46:41,110
MARISHA: This is a coup on a grander scale than
Whitestone that we're talking about.

1730
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:42,877
TRAVIS: I just want the guard.

1731
01:46:42,877 --> 01:46:44,801
SAM: Where's the guard? Can we see him?

1732
01:46:44,801 --> 01:46:47,821
MATT: You guys want to try and find him?

1733
01:46:47,821 --> 01:46:50,008
LAURA: Well, I saw him on the other side of the
thingie.

1734
01:46:50,008 --> 01:46:56,839
MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your way towards
the direction that Vex saw the guard. You start

1735
01:46:56,839 --> 01:47:01,479
pushing through the crop, making your way to the
edge, and at the point where these high crops end,

1736
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:06,809
it opens up into what looks like a heavy
root-based field. Potatoes, carrots, things that

1737
01:47:06,809 --> 01:47:16,412
are beneath the ground. You guys see across the
way the two other farmers that were out there, the

1738
01:47:16,412 --> 01:47:22,755
one that you saw being loosely beaten, they're
both filling satchels and emptying them into two

1739
01:47:22,755 --> 01:47:33,054
larger carts that are put up to horses, one of
them a larger pony. You see what appears to be

1740
01:47:33,054 --> 01:47:42,439
another hulking humanoid, taller than an average
person, skin slightly gray, a smattering of

1741
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:48,493
tattoos across the body. You recognize--

1742
01:47:48,493 --> 01:47:54,263
LIAM: And best we can tell, he's the only guard?
The only one?

1743
01:47:54,263 --> 01:47:56,033
TRAVIS: No, there's two. There's two.

1744
01:47:56,033 --> 01:47:57,284
LAURA: I have an idea!

1745
01:47:57,284 --> 01:47:59,483
SAM: Wait, he was about to tell us who it is.

1746
01:47:59,483 --> 01:48:04,137
MATT: From what you can see, you actually
recognize this individual.

1747
01:48:04,137 --> 01:48:06,768
TRAVIS: Fucking nipple tassels!

1748
01:48:06,768 --> 01:48:16,703
MATT: This is an individual that you knew quite a
ways ago, a young goliath who was still about a

1749
01:48:16,703 --> 01:48:25,876
half a foot shorter than you when you knew him. He
was named Horace, because he hated it, and Kevdak

1750
01:48:25,876 --> 01:48:32,391
gave him this name and you actually, at some point
in the past, recall even giving Horace a good

1751
01:48:32,391 --> 01:48:38,635
beating. A little of the smaller of the goliaths
you've encountered. This is years later. This punk

1752
01:48:38,635 --> 01:48:47,125
kid, and he was kind of a punk, has grown up now,
and is still smaller than you by a size, but still

1753
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:51,961
seems to be every bit of an agitating little bitch
you remember, from the way that he's treating

1754
01:48:51,961 --> 01:48:53,252
these people.

1755
01:48:53,252 --> 01:48:54,620
TRAVIS: Is he holding anything?

1756
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:59,227
MATT: Not in his hand at the moment, no, but he
does have across the back what looks to be some

1757
01:48:59,227 --> 01:49:01,136
sort of large blade sheathed.

1758
01:49:01,136 --> 01:49:03,812
LAURA: Can I give my idea?

1759
01:49:03,812 --> 01:49:04,922
TRAVIS: Yep.

1760
01:49:04,922 --> 01:49:11,427
LAURA: What if we ask Reginald to call for help,
like he needs this fuck's help, and then he comes

1761
01:49:11,427 --> 01:49:13,714
over, and then we spring a trap on him.

1762
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:15,407
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

1763
01:49:15,407 --> 01:49:21,001
LAURA: I can use Hide in Plain Sight on us, and
hide us, and make us look like we're part of the crops.

1764
01:49:21,049 --> 01:49:22,125
TRAVIS: I love it.

1765
01:49:22,125 --> 01:49:23,358
LAURA: To set an ambush.

1766
01:49:23,358 --> 01:49:24,313
TRAVIS: I love it.

1767
01:49:24,313 --> 01:49:28,525
LIAM: And the goal is to question this guy or to
take him out? To question, yeah?

1768
01:49:28,525 --> 01:49:33,577
TRAVIS: We're going to ask him questions, and if
he makes a peep-- Hold on, before we do that. Can

1769
01:49:33,577 --> 01:49:35,339
you see the other guard that was out here?

1770
01:49:35,339 --> 01:49:40,534
MATT: Glancing about, because it is a pretty open
area, you can see the secondary guard is walking

1771
01:49:40,534 --> 01:49:44,040
away, looking to check one of the other
homesteads. There is a farmhouse.

1772
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,645
TRAVIS: It's like Kansas, right, it's flat?

1773
01:49:46,645 --> 01:49:51,052
MATT: Yep, it's flat farmland on the outside of
Westruun. As soon as you break the south side of

1774
01:49:51,052 --> 01:49:53,241
the Bramblewood, it's just plain.

1775
01:49:53,241 --> 01:49:57,706
TRAVIS: What distance would you put him at? How
far away would you put him? 100 yards?

1776
01:49:57,706 --> 01:49:59,179
LAURA: The other guard?

1777
01:49:59,179 --> 01:50:01,398
MATT: I'd say the other guard's probably a good
400 feet.

1778
01:50:01,398 --> 01:50:02,672
TRAVIS: Do it.

1779
01:50:02,672 --> 01:50:04,013
LAURA: Yeah?

1780
01:50:04,013 --> 01:50:04,925
TRAVIS: Do it.

1781
01:50:04,925 --> 01:50:07,298
LAURA: Can I take a minute to camouflage us and
then tell Reginald to call him over?

1782
01:50:07,298 --> 01:50:08,084
MATT: Yeah.

1783
01:50:08,084 --> 01:50:11,766
TRAVIS: When he comes over, I grab him. Nobody do
anything that's loud.

1784
01:50:11,766 --> 01:50:13,539
LAURA: Got it.

1785
01:50:13,539 --> 01:50:21,920
MATT: Okay. So, as you all take a moment, stepping
into parts of the stalks of the edge of this land,

1786
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:28,158
Vex, you go ahead and start taking up leaves,
patches of dirt, mud from freshly watered ground,

1787
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:33,176
and you start smattering the rest of the group
with it. You guys are going full Arnold from

1788
01:50:33,176 --> 01:50:36,205
Predator. You begin to blend into the vicinity.

1789
01:50:36,205 --> 01:50:42,517
MARISHA: Question. Could I work with Percy?

1790
01:50:42,517 --> 01:50:44,219
TALIESIN: Yes?

1791
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:55,050
MARISHA: I have Entangle learned today. Could we
fashion a quick Entangle trap, where when the guy

1792
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:59,130
steps into it he'll be entangled? Or I could maybe
just be prepared for it?

1793
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:00,618
MATT: You can be prepared for it when it happens.

1794
01:51:00,618 --> 01:51:01,656
MARISHA: I'll be prepared for it.

1795
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:05,847
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw her a little sketch of
something that would spring, that you can make out

1796
01:51:05,847 --> 01:51:06,822
of wood.

1797
01:51:06,822 --> 01:51:11,880
MATT: The spell expends when cast, so it's more of
waiting to release it. To make it as part of a set

1798
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,426
trap, that would be a consumable trap you would
have to construct.

1799
01:51:15,426 --> 01:51:18,747
MARISHA: All right. I'll just be prepped with it.

1800
01:51:18,747 --> 01:51:22,077
MATT: Okay. So you guys all have hidden.

1801
01:51:22,077 --> 01:51:24,161
LAURA: Reginald.

1802
01:51:24,161 --> 01:51:27,823
MATT: He's behind you guys, watching all of this
happen. "Yes?"

1803
01:51:27,823 --> 01:51:32,979
LAURA: Act like you're still picking and act like
you hurt your ankle, and call for help from that

1804
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:35,381
guard over there. We'll protect you.

1805
01:51:35,381 --> 01:51:36,596
MATT: "Promise?"

1806
01:51:36,596 --> 01:51:38,522
TRAVIS: Yeah, I promise.

1807
01:51:38,522 --> 01:51:42,923
MARISHA: And try and maybe keep a bit of a
distance, because I'm going to be doing a trap

1808
01:51:42,923 --> 01:51:46,057
here. It's going to be 20 feet. You don't want to
be in it.

1809
01:51:46,057 --> 01:51:47,490
LAURA: Just step back and call for help.

1810
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:48,903
MARISHA: Just step back, all right?

1811
01:51:48,903 --> 01:51:55,346
MATT: So you guys are all working on the very edge
of where these crop fields begin. Reginald pushes

1812
01:51:55,346 --> 01:52:05,588
through a little bit, and goes, "Ow! Ow! Ow!" You
hear in the distance a voice go, "Hey you! What's

1813
01:52:05,588 --> 01:52:13,405
"your problem?" He goes, "My ankle!" And he starts
hobbling into the crop. "You shut your trap! It's

1814
01:52:13,405 --> 01:52:18,774
"your fucking ankle! What's that stupid-- Oh, you--"
(grunts) He starts lumbering up. "I'm going to

1815
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:23,725
"teach you about letting a peep out of that stupid
maw of yours! I'm going to beat that face so hard

1816
01:52:23,725 --> 01:52:26,791
"it can't make a noise ever again! Stupid git!"

1817
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:27,918
TALIESIN: And now.

1818
01:52:27,918 --> 01:52:29,593
MARISHA: (whoosh)

1819
01:52:29,593 --> 01:52:32,548
LAURA: The minute he's in the high crops so he's
out of visual from the other guard.

1820
01:52:32,548 --> 01:52:35,369
MATT: Okay. So as soon as he steps into the high
crop area.

1821
01:52:35,369 --> 01:52:37,800
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Percy's cue.

1822
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:39,229
TALIESIN: Now!

1823
01:52:39,229 --> 01:52:42,596
MATT: All right. So what are the specifics of the
Entanglement spell?

1824
01:52:42,596 --> 01:52:44,659
MARISHA: 20 feet.

1825
01:52:44,659 --> 01:52:52,293
SAM: It always works and it catches whoever you
want!

1826
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:53,836
MARISHA: It always works...

1827
01:52:53,836 --> 01:53:00,809
MATT: All of a sudden all of the crops, all of the
large stalks and vines start (whoosh) wrapping

1828
01:53:00,809 --> 01:53:02,139
around his body.

1829
01:53:02,139 --> 01:53:03,236
LAURA: Shit, mother bitch!

1830
01:53:03,236 --> 01:53:04,292
SAM: What's wrong?

1831
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:05,518
LAURA: That's a bit obvious.

1832
01:53:05,518 --> 01:53:06,439
MARISHA: Is it obvious?

1833
01:53:06,439 --> 01:53:09,784
MATT: It's once he's inside the area, so it's not
like the wall on the outside.

1834
01:53:09,784 --> 01:53:13,212
LAURA: Okay. I was picturing all the plants
suddenly losing their shit.

1835
01:53:13,212 --> 01:53:15,017
MATT: No, just the ones in the immediate
vicinity.

1836
01:53:15,017 --> 01:53:16,850
SAM: Like a used car lot?

1837
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:19,789
MATT: Okay, so he's going to attempt to make a
strength saving throw.

1838
01:53:19,789 --> 01:53:23,339
LIAM: I'm going to squat at the edge of the high
crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was

1839
01:53:23,339 --> 01:53:25,492
walking off just to make sure he's oblivious.

1840
01:53:25,492 --> 01:53:31,286
MATT: Make a perception check, if you could, Vax.
Surprised so he has disadvantage on the saving

1841
01:53:31,286 --> 01:53:32,959
throw. What's the DC?

1842
01:53:32,959 --> 01:53:34,796
MARISHA: Me? 19.

1843
01:53:34,796 --> 01:53:38,361
MATT: 19? That's a failure. All right, and what?

1844
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:39,550
LIAM: 28.

1845
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:43,136
MATT: 28! Yeah, Vax, keeping an eye, the guard
doesn't seem to have kept notice and continues

1846
01:53:43,136 --> 01:53:49,394
walking off towards the distant farmhouse. The
plants all wrap around his body and he:

1847
01:53:49,394 --> 01:53:50,832
"What's this? Stupid-- "

1848
01:53:50,832 --> 01:53:55,871
TRAVIS: I run over and I tackle him, knock him to
the ground, put my hand over his mouth, punch him

1849
01:53:55,871 --> 01:54:04,259
in the forehead. Punch him again. Punch him a
third time. And I barely lift my hand.

1850
01:54:04,259 --> 01:54:06,789
MATT: "You motherfucker-- "

1851
01:54:06,789 --> 01:54:08,368
TRAVIS: Punch him again.

1852
01:54:08,368 --> 01:54:11,990
MATT: At this point, now he's got blood pouring
out of the corner of the eye. One eye has gone a

1853
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:16,323
little red from burst vessels. You can see it
starting to swell up already. Blood's now pouring

1854
01:54:16,323 --> 01:54:20,258
out the side of the nose where you've hit it, and
he's still fighting even though the plants have

1855
01:54:20,258 --> 01:54:24,349
kept him entangled. As soon as the calm comes to
him (heavy breathing).

1856
01:54:24,349 --> 01:54:26,958
TRAVIS: (sing-song) Horace.

1857
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:34,851
MATT: The eyes go wide and all the tension in the
body loosens. "Fucking hell."

1858
01:54:34,851 --> 01:54:36,323
TRAVIS: (muffled) Fucking hell.

1859
01:54:36,323 --> 01:54:39,302
MATT: You're still holding his face? (muffled)
"Fucking hell."

1860
01:54:39,302 --> 01:54:48,275
TRAVIS: I'm going to move my hand. If you make a
sound, wash, rinse, repeat, yeah? Nod.

1861
01:54:48,275 --> 01:54:50,365
Shut the fuck up.

1862
01:54:50,365 --> 01:54:56,899
MATT: He spits a couple teeth out the side of his
mouth.

1863
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:59,887
TRAVIS: You're looking big.

1864
01:54:59,887 --> 01:55:07,911
MATT: "You're supposed to be dead. You're supposed
to be fucking dead. I watched you beaten to death.

1865
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:10,143
"Why the fuck are you still alive?"

1866
01:55:10,143 --> 01:55:16,737
TRAVIS: Yeah, right. Funny thing about me. So
look, who else is out in this field with you right now?

1867
01:55:16,737 --> 01:55:29,976
MATT: "No one. It's me and Cole, but Cole's
heading back to the city. We have other ones

1868
01:55:29,976 --> 01:55:33,934
"passed out around, but most of them stay in town,
especially during the day. That's where the

1869
01:55:33,934 --> 01:55:36,367
"festivities are."

1870
01:55:36,417 --> 01:55:38,078
LAURA: Festivities?

1871
01:55:38,078 --> 01:55:43,201
MATT: "Do you want back in? You're alive, man. Now's
the time. It's a good time for the herd."

1872
01:55:43,201 --> 01:55:48,914
TRAVIS: Yeah, no I want back in, for sure. That's
what I've come here for: to come back in. But

1873
01:55:48,914 --> 01:55:56,221
here's the thing. It's a bit of a surprise, right?
Other people haven't seen me. You like a good

1874
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:57,841
surprise, right, Horace?

1875
01:55:57,841 --> 01:56:00,736
MATT: "Yeah?"

1876
01:56:00,736 --> 01:56:06,371
TRAVIS: Yeah. I thought you might. Here's my
question: have you seen my cousin Zanror?

1877
01:56:06,371 --> 01:56:07,994
Is he in the city?

1878
01:56:07,994 --> 01:56:09,460
MATT: "Probably, aye."

1879
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:14,483
TRAVIS: Right. And what about Kevdak?

1880
01:56:14,483 --> 01:56:21,154
MATT: "Kevdak stays in the city, as well. Up at
the old Margrave's place, actually. Turned it into

1881
01:56:21,154 --> 01:56:24,608
"his palace. Want me to take you?"

1882
01:56:24,608 --> 01:56:30,563
TALIESIN: Before we go any further, what do I roll
if I want to find out if Horace really does like

1883
01:56:30,563 --> 01:56:33,901
surprises? I'm not kidding.

1884
01:56:33,901 --> 01:56:37,061
MATT: Make an insight check. All of you guys are
still hidden, by the way, unless you want

1885
01:56:37,061 --> 01:56:38,291
to do something.

1886
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:39,364
TALIESIN: No, I'm just watching.

1887
01:56:39,364 --> 01:56:41,870
LAURA: And we gained another plus ten, so now we
have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way,

1888
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:43,283
from that Hide in Plain Sight.

1889
01:56:43,283 --> 01:56:44,747
SAM: Wait, what?

1890
01:56:44,747 --> 01:56:48,718
LAURA: We have Pass Without a Trace, which adds
plus ten, Hide in Plain Sight adds plus ten.

1891
01:56:48,718 --> 01:56:50,844
That's what I camouflaged us fucking for.

1892
01:56:50,844 --> 01:56:52,788
SAM: How do you have all these things?

1893
01:56:52,788 --> 01:56:56,967
MATT: All of you guys make another stealth check
with plus 20.

1894
01:56:56,967 --> 01:57:04,308
MARISHA: Natural 20, so 40. Actually, I have a
stealth of seven.

1895
01:57:04,308 --> 01:57:05,599
LAURA: 46.

1896
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:06,937
TALIESIN: 43.

1897
01:57:06,937 --> 01:57:08,550
MARISHA: 47.

1898
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:12,205
MATT: You guys have never been seen.
Retroactively, no one's ever seen you in your

1899
01:57:12,205 --> 01:57:13,473
entire lives.

1900
01:57:13,473 --> 01:57:16,048
TALIESIN: I could fire my gun, at this point, and
they'd be like, oh, rain's coming.

1901
01:57:16,048 --> 01:57:19,603
MATT: If it was Bad News, it would still probably
break stealth.

1902
01:57:19,603 --> 01:57:20,939
TALIESIN: Well, if it was Bad News, yeah.

1903
01:57:20,939 --> 01:57:30,501
MATT: Okay, unless you rolled a one. Yeah, no.
(laughs) Horace hasn't seen anyone.

1904
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:34,875
"I could take you in."

1905
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:39,406
TRAVIS: Right, listen. I was going to pounce on
this poor farmer over here, but I saw you were

1906
01:57:39,406 --> 01:57:42,818
obviously keeping your eye on him. Why are you
doing that?

1907
01:57:42,818 --> 01:57:45,658
MATT: "Which one are you talking about? Reggie?"

1908
01:57:45,658 --> 01:57:47,856
TRAVIS: Yeah. Old Broken Foot over here.

1909
01:57:47,856 --> 01:57:55,113
MATT: (laughs) "He's a little bitch, that one is.
No, but you know what? I caught him sniffing

1910
01:57:55,113 --> 01:57:57,516
"around. I think he's keeping some gold hidden."

1911
01:57:57,516 --> 01:58:00,399
TRAVIS: Really? Gold? This poor farmer?

1912
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:01,800
MATT: "Twisted his arm a couple of times."

1913
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,998
TRAVIS: Have you?

1914
01:58:02,998 --> 01:58:06,504
MATT: "We could do this for old times' sake. Each
take an arm, pull until he tells us."

1915
01:58:06,504 --> 01:58:08,292
TRAVIS: Oh, like wishbone?

1916
01:58:08,292 --> 01:58:09,623
MATT: "Yeah."

1917
01:58:09,623 --> 01:58:15,748
TRAVIS: Yeah, that does sound like a good idea.
Here's my thing. Why are you guys in this city?

1918
01:58:15,748 --> 01:58:20,796
It's not really our thing to be in civilized
places.

1919
01:58:20,796 --> 01:58:27,915
MATT: "Here's the thing. Let me get loose here for
a minute. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable."

1920
01:58:27,915 --> 01:58:30,305
TRAVIS: No, I don't think I will, Horace.

1921
01:58:30,305 --> 01:58:41,803
MATT: "Okay. We were heading up north. We took out
a small caravan just south of the road cuts, near

1922
01:58:41,803 --> 01:58:46,807
"the Silvercut Way, and all of a sudden out of the
sky, we saw these streaking dragons come through.

1923
01:58:46,807 --> 01:58:53,523
"Largest I've ever seen. Dangerous as the day's
long. So we fled. We watched them come here and

1924
01:58:53,523 --> 01:59:00,773
"tear into this city. Rend it, destroy it, smoke
and flames and ice and all sorts of craziness. And

1925
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:07,863
"they kept going. We figured, dragons come, didn't
take the spoils, there's plenty of spoils for us.

1926
01:59:07,863 --> 01:59:13,526
"More than we could ever dream of. Most of it's
pretty well-guarded, but there couldn't be much

1927
01:59:13,526 --> 01:59:19,416
"left over there. So we gathered up who we had, and
mind you, the herd's swelled a bit since you left,

1928
01:59:19,416 --> 01:59:30,278
"my friend. We conquered another wandering tribe
last year. Zanror took the head of their leader

1929
01:59:30,278 --> 01:59:33,807
"and commanded them to join. We're about a hundred
strong these days."

1930
01:59:33,807 --> 01:59:35,362
TRAVIS: Jesus.

1931
01:59:35,362 --> 01:59:36,800
MARISHA: Fuck.

1932
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:44,385
MATT: "Pecking order. Still us goliaths at the
top. We got all sorts of other piddly men."

1933
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:45,533
TRAVIS: Really?

1934
01:59:45,533 --> 01:59:52,683
MATT: "Half-men, half-orcs. A few brutalized elves
here and there. They make cooking easy. Anyway, we

1935
01:59:52,683 --> 01:59:59,404
"took that moment and we rushed into the town. Took
it before the day was over. Killed all who didn't

1936
01:59:59,404 --> 02:00:09,897
"bow before Kevdak himself. Days of revelry ensued,
my friend. Oh, you missed out. Wine, women, gold.

1937
02:00:09,897 --> 02:00:21,520
"We took what we wanted until one of them dragons
came back. Black one. Scary. Killed a lot of us.

1938
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:27,820
"We weren't so much a hundred strong then, but by
the end of that we had 50 or 60 to our name before

1939
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:38,232
"the anger finally stopped. Kevdak bent a knee and
made an offering to this dragon."

1940
02:00:38,232 --> 02:00:39,750
TRAVIS: Kevdak did?

1941
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:52,033
MATT: "I know. But trust me, you see a beast this
size... it was survival through a mutual discussion, if you

1942
02:00:52,033 --> 02:01:00,977
"will. Promised our might to its worship, gathered
our spoils, deliver it every now and then. We got

1943
02:01:00,977 --> 02:01:08,826
"to have the leftovers. We rule the city in its
stead. Not a bad deal. Doesn't watch. We leave it

1944
02:01:08,826 --> 02:01:15,706
"what we find-- most of it, at least, we keep a
little on the side-- and we live like kings here.

1945
02:01:15,706 --> 02:01:19,002
"Westruun is now property of the herd."

1946
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:25,562
TRAVIS: Well, it sounds really good.

1947
02:01:25,562 --> 02:01:31,624
MATT: "You've missed out, and there's quite a few
openings now, since we've lost a few of the less

1948
02:01:31,624 --> 02:01:35,931
"than strong folk. You look strapping. I'm sure
Kevdak would be more than happy to have you back."

1949
02:01:35,931 --> 02:01:38,282
TRAVIS: I do. I've actually brought a few gifts.

1950
02:01:38,282 --> 02:01:40,721
LAURA: (whispering) I notch an arrow.

1951
02:01:40,721 --> 02:01:43,287
TRAVIS: I unsheathe Craven Edge.

1952
02:01:43,287 --> 02:01:46,257
MATT: "That's a good blade."

1953
02:01:46,257 --> 02:01:51,212
TRAVIS: Isn't it. And I ask out loud, are you
hungry?

1954
02:01:51,212 --> 02:02:02,270
MATT: "It's been probably half a day since
breakfast. Aye. Why?" His expression begins to

1955
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:06,245
shift as realization begins to dawn on his face.

1956
02:02:06,245 --> 02:02:10,174
TRAVIS: I pull it back. I stick the point in
between his ribcage, and I drive it up through him.

1957
02:02:10,174 --> 02:02:12,251
(shocked noises)

1958
02:02:12,251 --> 02:02:18,319
MATT: Before he can say a word-- he tries to speak
through the pain, but it's met with the gurgle as

1959
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:22,745
various bodily fluids fill the inside of his lungs
and throat.

1960
02:02:22,745 --> 02:02:24,622
TRAVIS: Oh, more?

1961
02:02:24,622 --> 02:02:30,265
MATT: The blade, now, you can see (choking noise)
peeks through the back of the mouth as his eyes go

1962
02:02:30,265 --> 02:02:35,917
ever so dull, the rest of the blood flow pouring
out the sides of his mouth.

1963
02:02:35,917 --> 02:02:39,168
TRAVIS: Pity that, acid reflux.

1964
02:02:39,168 --> 02:02:44,980
LAURA: Grog! Oh shit. Good job, there.

1965
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:46,371
MARISHA: Vex?

1966
02:02:46,371 --> 02:02:51,783
MATT: As this is happening, the blood that has
filled the mouth begins to seep back into the

1967
02:02:51,783 --> 02:02:58,221
mouth. The trails are still there, but what was
once filled to the brim has been slowly recessed,

1968
02:02:58,221 --> 02:03:07,935
swallowed. Not by the unmoving body of Horace, but
the dark blade itself now drawing from the inside.

1969
02:03:07,935 --> 02:03:11,771
LAURA: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?

1970
02:03:11,771 --> 02:03:13,108
TRAVIS: What?

1971
02:03:13,108 --> 02:03:14,848
LAURA: What is your sword doing?

1972
02:03:14,848 --> 02:03:22,054
TRAVIS: Nothing. It takes in the strength of who
it slays.

1973
02:03:22,054 --> 02:03:24,191
LAURA: It takes in the blood?

1974
02:03:24,191 --> 02:03:26,940
TRAVIS: Did it do that?

1975
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,374
LAURA: Grog.

1976
02:03:28,374 --> 02:03:29,654
TRAVIS: What?

1977
02:03:29,654 --> 02:03:34,340
SAM: You killed him. Was he related to you in some
way?

1978
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:40,283
TRAVIS: I don't know. I remember him. He was
always a little shit.

1979
02:03:40,283 --> 02:03:45,047
MARISHA: Grog, do you remember killing him five
seconds ago?

1980
02:03:45,047 --> 02:03:46,408
TRAVIS: Who?

1981
02:03:46,408 --> 02:03:49,133
MARISHA: Oh no. You guys.

1982
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:50,656
LAURA: The little dude. Your little friend?

1983
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,047
TRAVIS: Horace?

1984
02:03:52,047 --> 02:03:54,260
LAURA: You killed him. On purpose?

1985
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,181
TRAVIS: Sure.

1986
02:03:55,181 --> 02:03:56,202
LAURA: You wanted to?

1987
02:03:56,202 --> 02:03:57,822
TRAVIS: Yeah, he was going to go tell about us.

1988
02:03:57,822 --> 02:03:59,653
MARISHA: You were conscious of that?

1989
02:03:59,653 --> 02:04:00,970
TRAVIS: What?

1990
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:02,533
MARISHA: Is it me?

1991
02:04:02,533 --> 02:04:04,816
SAM: You're using too-big words.

1992
02:04:04,816 --> 02:04:14,769
TRAVIS: So listen, right? Either we stay and do
some recon, or we take out the other guy that's

1993
02:04:14,769 --> 02:04:23,872
walking back to the city. Really shouldn't be a
problem. But if they're all in there, 50 strong, I

1994
02:04:23,872 --> 02:04:30,073
don't think we're quite ready for that. The sneaky
fucks in our group could go take a look, if you're

1995
02:04:30,073 --> 02:04:31,387
feeling randy.

1996
02:04:31,387 --> 02:04:34,530
SAM: What would be our mission?

1997
02:04:34,530 --> 02:04:36,920
TRAVIS: Info only.

1998
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:42,835
SAM: You killed this one quite easily.

1999
02:04:42,835 --> 02:04:44,300
MARISHA: Very easily.

2000
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:47,444
TRAVIS: Yeah, but that's because we did it as a
group.

2001
02:04:47,444 --> 02:04:48,580
MARISHA: Did we?

2002
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:52,678
LAURA: Could we wait until nightfall?

2003
02:04:52,678 --> 02:04:57,404
SAM: I'm going to check out his body. See if
there's any booty on his body.

2004
02:04:57,404 --> 02:05:03,267
LAURA: Well, as soon as we move, we won't be
camouflaged in this crop anymore. We'll lose that.

2005
02:05:03,267 --> 02:05:05,021
MARISHA: Yeah, we won't look like crops.

2006
02:05:05,021 --> 02:05:16,526
MATT: As the stalks unwind, leaving his defiled
body and you draw the blade free, Scanlan, you

2007
02:05:16,526 --> 02:05:23,339
find, across the body, there is a simple, slightly
chipped-but-still-functional greatsword that was

2008
02:05:23,339 --> 02:05:32,051
sheathed in the back, wrapped in a haphazard hide
that functioned as a scabbard. Mostly just leather

2009
02:05:32,051 --> 02:05:38,146
pants, a few furs, looks to be a bone necklace and
a bone bracelet around the wrist which looks to be

2010
02:05:38,146 --> 02:05:45,967
teeth, human teeth. About 27 gold pieces in total
change.

2011
02:05:45,967 --> 02:05:48,607
TRAVIS: How far are we from the city here?

2012
02:05:48,607 --> 02:05:51,989
MATT: About a five-minute walk.

2013
02:05:51,989 --> 02:05:53,765
TRAVIS: Five-minute walk. That's not far.

2014
02:05:53,765 --> 02:05:57,256
LAURA: Keyleth, can you use your powers to suck
him into the ground so that nobody sees him?

2015
02:05:57,256 --> 02:06:02,288
TALIESIN: I honestly don't think they're going to
find him, anyway.

2016
02:06:02,288 --> 02:06:07,123
LAURA: I use my abilities and try to camouflage
the body so that nobody finds him.

2017
02:06:07,123 --> 02:06:12,473
MATT: You pull him up into one of the walls of the
plant stalks and set him in there, mounding up

2018
02:06:12,473 --> 02:06:15,494
whatever bits of fallen leaves and dirt you can.
He's pretty well-hidden.

2019
02:06:15,494 --> 02:06:21,997
MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft to grow some flowers
on top of the dirt.

2020
02:06:21,997 --> 02:06:27,103
MATT: Some flowers come up there. Some of the
local leaves from the stalks bend down and help

2021
02:06:27,103 --> 02:06:28,152
cover him up.

2022
02:06:28,152 --> 02:06:30,298
TALIESIN: Leave a couple of his human teeth that
he's collected--

2023
02:06:30,298 --> 02:06:32,715
SAM: I'll leave all his human teeth, I'm not
gonna take that shit.

2024
02:06:32,715 --> 02:06:37,737
MARISHA: Great, so very successful trip. Stopping
down.

2025
02:06:37,737 --> 02:06:39,516
LAURA: Reggie?

2026
02:06:39,516 --> 02:06:41,465
LIAM: His partner's still long-gone.

2027
02:06:41,465 --> 02:06:42,516
TRAVIS: That guard?

2028
02:06:42,516 --> 02:06:43,516
LAURA: The other guard, yeah?

2029
02:06:43,516 --> 02:06:48,018
MATT: The guard's gone. Reggie's still sitting
there, watched this whole thing happen. Looking at

2030
02:06:48,018 --> 02:06:53,847
you and goes, "You did good. You did good."

2031
02:06:53,847 --> 02:06:57,497
TRAVIS: I know I did. Just imagine what we'll do
to the rest of them.

2032
02:06:57,497 --> 02:07:00,817
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you."

2033
02:07:00,817 --> 02:07:04,794
SAM: Are we going to do anything to the rest of
them?

2034
02:07:04,794 --> 02:07:06,091
LAURA: Right now?

2035
02:07:06,091 --> 02:07:07,702
TALIESIN: I think we're going to go take a look.

2036
02:07:07,702 --> 02:07:14,556
TRAVIS: I don't mind you taking a look, but <i>be
careful</i>.

2037
02:07:14,556 --> 02:07:19,716
TALIESIN: We can also still turn into mist.

2038
02:07:19,716 --> 02:07:21,155
MARISHA: We can.

2039
02:07:21,155 --> 02:07:22,856
LAURA: They can't hurt us when we're mist.

2040
02:07:22,856 --> 02:07:25,327
SAM: We can all mist and go into the city and
check it out.

2041
02:07:25,327 --> 02:07:26,373
LAURA: See what we see.

2042
02:07:26,373 --> 02:07:27,369
TALIESIN: Be fast and stealthy.

2043
02:07:27,369 --> 02:07:29,209
LAURA: Can we stealth while we're misting?

2044
02:07:29,209 --> 02:07:31,860
SAM: It doesn't matter if they see us, they can't
do anything to us.

2045
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:37,025
MATT: Yeah, it would be being conscious of the
cloud patterns in the sky, moving with the wind in

2046
02:07:37,025 --> 02:07:42,466
a way where you become less noticeable as something
strange. So it's possible.

2047
02:07:42,466 --> 02:07:45,680
LAURA: Let's try that, so we can spy on the city!
Get closer in.

2048
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,307
TRAVIS: It feels kind of cheap.

2049
02:07:47,307 --> 02:07:49,058
LAURA: Why?

2050
02:07:49,058 --> 02:07:53,029
TRAVIS: I don't know.

2051
02:07:53,029 --> 02:07:58,140
LAURA: At least if we go in, Grog, we can see what
we're up against.

2052
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:06,463
TRAVIS: Yeah, but can't we use our eyes? Just as
they are. Do we have to turn to smoke this time?

2053
02:08:06,463 --> 02:08:11,254
MARISHA: Why would we not?

2054
02:08:11,254 --> 02:08:13,964
TRAVIS: It feels a little cowardly.

2055
02:08:13,964 --> 02:08:16,713
LAURA: It's not cowardly, Grog, it's safe.

2056
02:08:16,713 --> 02:08:18,110
SAM: You can stay behind.

2057
02:08:18,110 --> 02:08:25,697
LIAM: What if Vex and I went as mist, just the two
of us, quickly? Just the two of us.

2058
02:08:25,697 --> 02:08:27,575
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fine.

2059
02:08:27,575 --> 02:08:32,112
TALIESIN: I may join you two for this as well.

2060
02:08:32,112 --> 02:08:33,300
LAURA: All right.

2061
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:39,401
MARISHA: And what are the rest of us going to do?
Just wait? Me, Scanlan, and Grog?

2062
02:08:39,401 --> 02:08:43,317
TRAVIS: You can turn into a cloud, and float in
there, and see what you want to see, but I'm not

2063
02:08:43,317 --> 02:08:48,876
turning into mist when my herd is inside that
city. If I go in, I'm going in.

2064
02:08:48,876 --> 02:08:52,199
SAM: As Grog.

2065
02:08:52,199 --> 02:08:53,524
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2066
02:08:53,524 --> 02:08:56,000
MARISHA: So why don't we just not go in right
now?

2067
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,717
SAM: Why don't you all go in, I'll stay back with
Grog.

2068
02:09:00,717 --> 02:09:03,235
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2069
02:09:03,235 --> 02:09:05,160
LAURA: All right.

2070
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:08,218
TALIESIN: Not crazy-ish.

2071
02:09:08,218 --> 02:09:16,505
MATT: All right, the four of you convert into mist
form, crest up over the edge and start drifting

2072
02:09:16,505 --> 02:09:25,511
your way over the top of Westruun, leaving
Scanlan, Grog, and Reginald amongst the crops.

2073
02:09:25,511 --> 02:09:28,659
TRAVIS: Reginald, you want some ale?

2074
02:09:28,659 --> 02:09:30,979
MATT: "Do you have some?"

2075
02:09:30,979 --> 02:09:36,075
TRAVIS: No, I do, yeah, hold on. Get the cask out,
pour him a cup.

2076
02:09:36,075 --> 02:09:40,219
MATT: He drinks thirstily, both because he seems
genuinely thirsty, and second, it seems like he

2077
02:09:40,219 --> 02:09:41,926
could use a long, hard drink.

2078
02:09:41,926 --> 02:09:44,358
TRAVIS: Pace yourself, son, there's a lot that's
here.

2079
02:09:44,358 --> 02:09:48,113
MATT: "I've been drinking longer than you've been
alive, friend." Just (guzzles).

2080
02:09:48,113 --> 02:09:50,139
TRAVIS: Wow. Another?

2081
02:09:50,139 --> 02:09:51,795
MATT: "Yeah."

2082
02:09:51,795 --> 02:09:53,301
TRAVIS: I'll keep them coming.

2083
02:09:53,301 --> 02:09:57,254
MATT: And, for that, we'll take a quick break,
come back here. See you guys here in a few

2084
02:09:57,254 --> 02:10:01,844
minutes, and we'll continue this story. See you in
a minute!

2085
02:10:01,844 --> 02:26:57,507
[break]

2086
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:58,863
TALIESIN: Cock goblin.

2087
02:26:58,863 --> 02:27:04,721
MATT: Welcome back! Ha ha, they got it on stream!
Sorry, Liam, we're not as good as you are at it.

2088
02:27:04,721 --> 02:27:08,947
So, guys, quick note before we get back into the
game. Apparently, the shirt link wasn't working

2089
02:27:08,995 --> 02:27:14,005
earlier, it is working now. They got it
functional, so go ahead and hop on now while you

2090
02:27:14,005 --> 02:27:22,861
can. Returning from the break, as Grog and Scanlan
sit, waiting to hear back from the rest of the

2091
02:27:22,861 --> 02:27:28,803
team, traversing over towards Westruun, seeking
information in their mist forms. The two of you

2092
02:27:28,803 --> 02:27:34,520
remain behind. The four of you guys who are in
mist form, where are you going?

2093
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:43,253
LAURA: Can we stealthily head towards a pocket of
people? Do we see a crowd of people being held?

2094
02:27:43,253 --> 02:27:46,278
MATT: This is your mist form?

2095
02:27:46,278 --> 02:27:47,493
LAURA: This is my mist form.

2096
02:27:47,493 --> 02:27:49,756
MATT: Ocean. I like it. I'd like you guys to make
stealth checks.

2097
02:27:49,756 --> 02:27:51,173
LAURA: Stealth checks!

2098
02:27:51,173 --> 02:27:53,807
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

2099
02:27:53,807 --> 02:27:54,888
LAURA: Yes!

2100
02:27:54,888 --> 02:28:00,644
39.

2101
02:28:00,644 --> 02:28:02,533
LIAM: 42.

2102
02:28:02,533 --> 02:28:03,965
TALIESIN: 33.

2103
02:28:03,965 --> 02:28:05,224
MARISHA: 24.

2104
02:28:05,224 --> 02:28:15,253
MATT: You guys make your way across the rest of
the fields. You head over Cole, you can see

2105
02:28:15,253 --> 02:28:21,110
walking his way to the outside of the western side
of the city. You come towards the bottom of the

2106
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:28,619
gate. You can see the rigid, small fence structure
you noticed when you were far away from the city

2107
02:28:28,619 --> 02:28:36,997
becomes more clearly visible. It is a series of
spears and pikes that are set up as a barrier or a

2108
02:28:36,997 --> 02:28:43,273
barricade to the outside world to Westruun. You do
see adorned atop a number of them a few heads,

2109
02:28:43,273 --> 02:28:46,458
varying sizes, various people, various ages.

2110
02:28:46,458 --> 02:28:49,658
MARISHA: Does this appear to be goliath-built?

2111
02:28:49,658 --> 02:28:53,478
MATT: It's hard to say. It looks built.

2112
02:28:53,478 --> 02:28:56,777
LAURA: And the spikes are facing inward towards
the city, or outward?

2113
02:28:56,777 --> 02:29:02,818
MATT: Outwards. There are breaks in it, but
essentially it's partially a pseudo-defense

2114
02:29:02,818 --> 02:29:06,494
mechanism, it's more as a warning, it's a point of
intimidation.

2115
02:29:06,494 --> 02:29:11,504
MARISHA: So does it look pretty jerry-rigged?

2116
02:29:11,504 --> 02:29:17,432
MATT: Yeah. It's not anything too classically
designed.

2117
02:29:17,432 --> 02:29:20,415
LIAM: No flying buttresses?

2118
02:29:20,415 --> 02:29:22,252
MATT: Not quite, no.

2119
02:29:22,252 --> 02:29:28,244
TALIESIN: Doric columns, oh my <i>god</i>! Awful!
Tacky!

2120
02:29:28,244 --> 02:29:32,784
MATT: You coast over the outside wall and glance
down within. You can see there are people

2121
02:29:32,784 --> 02:29:42,268
wandering the town, townsfolk that are out in the
streets. Many of them are in pairs or groups, two

2122
02:29:42,268 --> 02:29:49,745
to four people, appear to be traveling from
one place to another. Most of them are accompanied

2123
02:29:49,745 --> 02:29:57,344
by one or two armed individuals. Some of the
people have chains around their neck. You do see a

2124
02:29:57,344 --> 02:30:02,527
number of these buildings are in ruins, patchwork
places. Some are just crushed. Some appear to have

2125
02:30:02,527 --> 02:30:08,990
been melted down, like the wood or stonework
itself has been dissolved into a pile of matter.

2126
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:17,913
You see places where fires have broken out and
some places have burned into a giant cluster of

2127
02:30:17,913 --> 02:30:26,190
ash and broken wood. A quick memory glance at this
height, you start looking for specific areas that

2128
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:31,649
you recall from memory. One: you glance over and
see where you first came to meet Pike, where she

2129
02:30:31,649 --> 02:30:39,731
and Wilhand lived. That area is the area of town
that was, apparently, salvaged from the battle. It

2130
02:30:39,731 --> 02:30:45,438
still stands, there appears to be very minimal
impact. As you give yourself enough closeness to

2131
02:30:45,438 --> 02:30:49,899
check in, the red brick homestead of Wilhand does
appear to be standing.

2132
02:30:49,899 --> 02:30:51,742
LAURA: Can we see Wilhand anywhere?

2133
02:30:51,742 --> 02:31:04,701
MATT: At this distance, no. You also note, towards
the shopping district of Westruun, there is the shop

2134
02:31:04,701 --> 02:31:09,160
of Abjurist Noja, one of your first enchanter
friends who protected you during your first

2135
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,295
Winter's Crest.

2136
02:31:10,295 --> 02:31:13,103
MARISHA: Yeah! He cast the protection spell on
us!

2137
02:31:13,103 --> 02:31:14,793
TALIESIN: This is making me feel very old.

2138
02:31:14,793 --> 02:31:20,864
MATT: His structure is still standing as well. A
few buildings around did not fare so well, but his

2139
02:31:20,864 --> 02:31:29,486
shop and a number of other ones adjacent to it
seem to still be standing. You can't really tell

2140
02:31:29,486 --> 02:31:33,500
if they're functional, or how busy they are, or if
anyone's doing anything with them, but that's still

2141
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:41,513
there. You do notice, though, at numerous parts of
the street, there are just piles and piles of

2142
02:31:41,513 --> 02:31:50,768
burnt wood and ash, like they're large burn piles
that were set at different periods of time and

2143
02:31:50,768 --> 02:31:57,516
have long since burned. Little bits of white,
post-burning plumes that still smolder over the

2144
02:31:57,516 --> 02:32:03,067
past few days. You're not quite sure what these
piles contained at the time they were set ablaze.

2145
02:32:03,067 --> 02:32:12,746
There is still the worship district here. You have
the various temples. Best you can glance, a few of

2146
02:32:12,746 --> 02:32:17,883
them have been partially toppled. There is damage
to some of the buildings. Still too far away to

2147
02:32:17,883 --> 02:32:24,307
make out any specific details beyond that, some of the
structures having taken a hit in previous

2148
02:32:24,307 --> 02:32:26,426
conflicts. You're not sure from which source.

2149
02:32:26,426 --> 02:32:30,222
LAURA: What about the mayor's house where we heard
Horace--?

2150
02:32:30,222 --> 02:32:39,374
MATT: The Margrave's. Towards the southern central portion
of Westruun, south of the main town square where

2151
02:32:39,374 --> 02:32:45,007
the bulk of your first Winter's Crest festival
here in Westruun took place. The Margrave's house

2152
02:32:45,007 --> 02:32:50,943
is at the very southernmost portion of that. That
entire square is lined with row after row of

2153
02:32:50,943 --> 02:32:59,429
sharpened wood sticks and various other weapons,
tridents, broken swords that have been, with

2154
02:32:59,429 --> 02:33:06,205
ropes, strapped together to form a military
barricade. If anything were to attempt to attack

2155
02:33:06,205 --> 02:33:12,680
from the ground, it would be difficult to do so if this
area was filled with prepared soldiers, using

2156
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:22,098
these as protective guard. The actual Margrave's
home is intact, although at this glance, you can

2157
02:33:22,098 --> 02:33:30,161
see a lot of it has been defiled, elements of the
outside walls are strewn with dark burgundy paint

2158
02:33:30,161 --> 02:33:40,287
slapped over. You can see what looks to be some
sort of strings adorning edges of it, like

2159
02:33:40,287 --> 02:33:49,590
decoration. You see, walking through this area,
what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals

2160
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:55,231
of varying heights. Probably a good six or seven
goliaths among them. Others appear to be human,

2161
02:33:55,231 --> 02:34:00,050
half-orc, it's hard to make out the full details
from this distance. They're all on the outskirts

2162
02:34:00,050 --> 02:34:07,073
surrounding what was previously the Margrave's
home. Now the homestead of Kevdak, seemingly.

2163
02:34:07,073 --> 02:34:09,462
LAURA: Can we see Kevdak anywhere?

2164
02:34:09,462 --> 02:34:11,516
MATT: You have no idea what Kevdak looks like.

2165
02:34:11,516 --> 02:34:15,389
LAURA: I look for a bigger goliath than the rest,
or one that looks older and bigger.

2166
02:34:15,389 --> 02:34:18,353
MATT: Make a perception check.

2167
02:34:18,353 --> 02:34:20,991
LAURA: 16.

2168
02:34:20,991 --> 02:34:24,923
MATT: 16. At this distance, it's hard to make out
any specific details. You can barely make out the

2169
02:34:24,923 --> 02:34:28,907
fact that they're goliath. It's only because
you've traveled with Grog so long you can pick out

2170
02:34:28,907 --> 02:34:34,805
the details, the hairless form, the tattoos, the
general tone of skin. They're male and female,

2171
02:34:34,805 --> 02:34:41,260
it's a smattering of all different types of
goliaths. Some of different thickness, some that

2172
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:46,687
are a little more barrel-chested and wide, some
that are a little shorter. There are other

2173
02:34:46,687 --> 02:34:49,998
similarly dressed individuals that are not
goliaths as well, but they seem to be more of a

2174
02:34:49,998 --> 02:34:54,682
subservient role within the herd than the goliaths
that would be the ruling class within this

2175
02:34:54,682 --> 02:35:02,507
self-contained society. But no one stands out to
you as matching the descriptions of Kevdak that

2176
02:35:02,507 --> 02:35:03,502
Grog gave you.

2177
02:35:03,502 --> 02:35:06,296
TALIESIN: The mansion seems to be where they've
based their operations, though.

2178
02:35:06,296 --> 02:35:07,878
MATT: Seemingly.

2179
02:35:07,878 --> 02:35:11,631
LAURA: We don't see a cluster of prisoners
anywhere out in the open?

2180
02:35:11,631 --> 02:35:13,878
TALIESIN: Where's the prison I was being held in?

2181
02:35:13,878 --> 02:35:18,290
MATT: The prison you were being held in was in the
Umbra Hills. That's far north of Westruun.

2182
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:20,287
LIAM: That's when we fought the Nightmare.

2183
02:35:20,287 --> 02:35:21,399
LAURA: Yeah!

2184
02:35:21,399 --> 02:35:25,795
TALIESIN: (laughs) (imitates Laura) Yeah!

2185
02:35:25,795 --> 02:35:28,615
LAURA: Do we see a cluster?

2186
02:35:28,615 --> 02:35:31,107
MATT: Do you see a what?

2187
02:35:31,107 --> 02:35:34,405
LAURA: A cluster of prisoners out in the open at
all, or is it just out around--?

2188
02:35:34,405 --> 02:35:37,022
MATT: It's hard to tell because most everyone who
lives here is, in some, way, shape, or form a

2189
02:35:37,022 --> 02:35:46,011
prisoner. You do see at the various gates of the city
as you went through, there's about three, four

2190
02:35:46,011 --> 02:35:53,078
individuals average stationed there. Nobody seems
to be entering or exiting. And the pace of those

2191
02:35:53,078 --> 02:36:00,141
that are not of the herd that you see walking
through the city has a feel of hopelessness, or

2192
02:36:00,141 --> 02:36:06,990
at least their presence outdoors is more of
function. They do what they're told, and if

2193
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:10,442
they're not, you've already seen what happens to
them.

2194
02:36:10,442 --> 02:36:14,382
MARISHA: Now what?

2195
02:36:14,382 --> 02:36:18,973
TALIESIN: Maybe stealth isn't-- maybe Grog's
right-- we can't talk, can we?

2196
02:36:18,973 --> 02:36:20,388
MARISHA: No, we're fucking clouds.

2197
02:36:20,388 --> 02:36:24,368
LAURA: Can we say go back to the--

2198
02:36:24,368 --> 02:36:26,858
LIAM: Yeah, I'm gesturing to go. Get out.

2199
02:36:26,858 --> 02:36:28,289
LAURA: Yeah, let's go back.

2200
02:36:28,289 --> 02:36:30,878
MATT: Make a stealth check, guys, on the way out.

2201
02:36:30,878 --> 02:36:33,141
SAM: 93.

2202
02:36:33,141 --> 02:36:36,715
TRAVIS: Scanlan and I have been alone.

2203
02:36:36,715 --> 02:36:38,102
LAURA: 39.

2204
02:36:38,102 --> 02:36:39,507
MARISHA: 32.

2205
02:36:39,507 --> 02:36:40,648
LIAM: 44.

2206
02:36:40,648 --> 02:36:41,982
TALIESIN: 26.

2207
02:36:41,982 --> 02:36:48,025
MATT: Okay! You guys make your way westward. Is
there anything you guys wanted to accomplish while

2208
02:36:48,025 --> 02:36:49,361
they were gone?

2209
02:36:49,361 --> 02:36:51,436
SAM: Just massage each other.

2210
02:36:51,436 --> 02:36:58,427
TRAVIS: Right, so I turn to Scanlan. And I say:
you and I are mates, right?

2211
02:36:58,427 --> 02:37:00,590
SAM: Yes, the best of mates.

2212
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:06,899
TRAVIS: Right. Could I confide something in you?

2213
02:37:06,899 --> 02:37:10,169
SAM: I wasn't aware that you knew what that word
meant.

2214
02:37:10,169 --> 02:37:20,453
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Right. Well, I'm full of
surprises. One of which is-- so, I had this

2215
02:37:20,453 --> 02:37:27,629
horrible dream recently, and in the dream, I was
killing all these people with this amazing sword

2216
02:37:27,629 --> 02:37:28,858
that I have.

2217
02:37:28,858 --> 02:37:30,096
SAM: Yes?

2218
02:37:30,096 --> 02:37:35,820
TRAVIS: But there were a lot of people, and some
of the people that got killed I knew. And I feel

2219
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:45,372
it has something to do with this sword that I
have. And the secret is: I can hear the sword

2220
02:37:45,372 --> 02:37:47,397
talking to me.

2221
02:37:47,397 --> 02:37:50,773
SAM: Like, talking-talking, or you just--

2222
02:37:50,773 --> 02:37:57,149
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, so I'm telling you because you
and I have such a history, right? And I feel like

2223
02:37:57,149 --> 02:38:01,857
you won't judge me, but, like, I'm afraid the rest
of the group won't quite understand. I don't know

2224
02:38:01,857 --> 02:38:05,941
if I'm crazy or if this sword is talking to me.

2225
02:38:05,941 --> 02:38:08,086
SAM: Do you see a mouth on it or anything?

2226
02:38:08,086 --> 02:38:10,692
TRAVIS: No, I just hear a voice and I was
wondering if maybe I take it out--

2227
02:38:10,692 --> 02:38:11,878
SAM: All the time?

2228
02:38:11,878 --> 02:38:15,450
TRAVIS: No, only when I'm holding it. So, like, I
could take it out now and we could see maybe if

2229
02:38:15,450 --> 02:38:16,655
you hear it.

2230
02:38:16,655 --> 02:38:17,580
SAM: Okay.

2231
02:38:17,580 --> 02:38:19,035
TRAVIS: So I take out Craven Edge.

2232
02:38:19,035 --> 02:38:22,182
MATT: You take out Craven Edge, you hold it out in
front of you.

2233
02:38:22,182 --> 02:38:28,796
TRAVIS: Craven Edge. How did you enjoy your
snack?

2234
02:38:28,796 --> 02:38:35,926
MATT: "It was a good snack. A snack it was. If
there's more where that came from,

2235
02:38:35,926 --> 02:38:38,427
"I would be so thankful."

2236
02:38:38,427 --> 02:38:40,281
TRAVIS: Are you getting that?!

2237
02:38:40,281 --> 02:38:42,966
SAM: No, Grog, I'm not.

2238
02:38:42,966 --> 02:38:47,726
TRAVIS: You're not hearing anything? No, like,
super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice? Nothing?

2239
02:38:47,726 --> 02:38:49,527
SAM: Try one more time.

2240
02:38:49,527 --> 02:38:59,075
TRAVIS: No, it's not worth it. Look, do you want
to hold the sword?

2241
02:38:59,075 --> 02:39:05,124
SAM: Sure! That's a good idea, actually! Can I
hold the sword? How big is it?

2242
02:39:05,124 --> 02:39:12,985
MATT: It's a greatsword. It's almost twice the
length of your whole body and probably weighs

2243
02:39:12,985 --> 02:39:14,879
close to as much as you do.

2244
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:19,096
SAM: Can you hold the top part and I'll just hold it by
the handle, the hilty-part?

2245
02:39:19,096 --> 02:39:21,915
TRAVIS: I hold the blade, and I hand the hilt
towards Scanlan.

2246
02:39:21,915 --> 02:39:26,028
MATT: As you hand the hilt over towards him, there's
hesitation in the voice, "Only you are worthy of

2247
02:39:26,028 --> 02:39:28,447
"holding me. You will hand me to no one."

2248
02:39:28,447 --> 02:39:38,910
TRAVIS: (grunts) See, now, now, now, Craven, I'm
starting to feel like I'm doubting myself. I'm

2249
02:39:38,910 --> 02:39:42,165
seeing things-- he's talking to me.

2250
02:39:42,165 --> 02:39:43,300
SAM: Okay.

2251
02:39:43,300 --> 02:39:48,984
TRAVIS: I'm going to take it right back, I just
want him to experience your glory.

2252
02:39:48,984 --> 02:39:50,420
MATT: Make a charisma check.

2253
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:53,442
TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. That's bad.

2254
02:39:53,442 --> 02:39:54,678
LAURA: No.

2255
02:39:54,678 --> 02:39:59,922
TRAVIS: (gulp) Seven.

2256
02:39:59,922 --> 02:40:18,018
MATT: Seven? Okay. You can't give the sword up. It
means too much, and the voice in your head says,

2257
02:40:18,018 --> 02:40:24,219
"Only those proven worthy to feed me can
carry me. And you, Grog--"

2258
02:40:24,219 --> 02:40:26,456
SAM: Grog, hand me the sword.

2259
02:40:26,456 --> 02:40:33,716
TRAVIS: (pained) No. On second thought, don't
worry about it. It's clearly-- and I take it

2260
02:40:33,716 --> 02:40:43,038
back-- it's not, it's just-- maybe I just need to
see someone or talk to somebody. Clearly, I mean,

2261
02:40:43,038 --> 02:40:45,785
you don't-- it's talking, you don't hear it,
right?

2262
02:40:45,785 --> 02:40:49,672
SAM: I don't hear it, but maybe if you handed it
to me, I could.

2263
02:40:49,672 --> 02:40:53,649
TRAVIS: No, it's really heavy, too. And I sheathe
it.

2264
02:40:53,649 --> 02:40:55,403
SAM: Do I believe him?

2265
02:40:55,403 --> 02:40:58,911
MATT: Make an insight check.

2266
02:40:58,911 --> 02:40:59,954
SAM: Not good.

2267
02:40:59,954 --> 02:41:02,041
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

2268
02:41:02,041 --> 02:41:05,175
SAM: Not good! Seven!

2269
02:41:05,175 --> 02:41:06,311
TRAVIS: Three!

2270
02:41:06,311 --> 02:41:09,307
(laughing)

2271
02:41:09,307 --> 02:41:16,011
MATT: Grog's not the most able liar, you glean.
You're pretty good at seeing past the deceit of

2272
02:41:16,011 --> 02:41:20,102
others. This definitely falls under the line of
deceit, as adorable as it is to see him try.

2273
02:41:20,102 --> 02:41:28,597
SAM: Grog, you want to give me the sword. And I
will cast Suggestion on him.

2274
02:41:28,597 --> 02:41:31,104
LAURA: Ooh!

2275
02:41:31,104 --> 02:41:33,340
MATT: Is it a wisdom saving throw?

2276
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:35,858
SAM: I haven't used it in a while, and I don't
have my thing.

2277
02:41:35,858 --> 02:41:39,070
MATT: I'll pull it up real fast, just to make
sure. I'm pretty sure it is.

2278
02:41:39,070 --> 02:41:40,660
TALIESIN: I think it is.

2279
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:48,358
MATT: Yep, make a wisdom saving throw.

2280
02:41:48,358 --> 02:41:55,086
TRAVIS: Giant modifier on this one. 16. With a
modifier of zero.

2281
02:41:55,086 --> 02:41:56,677
SAM: Well, 18, if I'm not using my thing.

2282
02:41:56,677 --> 02:42:00,710
MATT: Not using the cone, so no, it still fails.
So you feel compelled now to give this sword.

2283
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:02,665
You're like, no, that's a great idea.

2284
02:42:02,665 --> 02:42:07,381
TRAVIS: You know what? That's a great idea! I feel
like you should hold this sword. And I hold on to the

2285
02:42:07,381 --> 02:42:09,926
blade, but I still hand the hilt to him.

2286
02:42:09,926 --> 02:42:19,657
MATT: As he holds up the sword towards you,
you grasp the handle. As his hand touches it, the

2287
02:42:19,657 --> 02:42:26,473
voice goes, "No! Only you can wield me!" Go ahead
and make a wisdom saving throw again.

2288
02:42:26,473 --> 02:42:29,428
TRAVIS: 18.

2289
02:42:29,428 --> 02:42:31,429
MATT: I'm sorry, that's a charisma saving throw.

2290
02:42:31,429 --> 02:42:32,671
TRAVIS: 19.

2291
02:42:32,671 --> 02:42:34,683
MATT: 19?

2292
02:42:34,683 --> 02:42:35,892
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus one.

2293
02:42:35,892 --> 02:42:42,108
MATT: All right. You feel the influence of the
blade begin into creep into your mind, but the

2294
02:42:42,108 --> 02:42:48,103
bond you have with Scanlan and the time you've
traveled together, you manage to shrug it off.

2295
02:42:48,103 --> 02:42:57,330
Fighting that impulse, you still hand the blade
over. You take the handle. You let go of the

2296
02:42:57,330 --> 02:43:01,392
weapon. You hold it in your hand now. It's a
(heavy thud).

2297
02:43:01,392 --> 02:43:05,225
TALIESIN: You ruin everything good! You take
everything good away from all of us!

2298
02:43:05,225 --> 02:43:07,563
SAM: Well, it's heavy.

2299
02:43:07,563 --> 02:43:09,949
TALIESIN: Throw it into acid, why don't you?!

2300
02:43:09,949 --> 02:43:11,503
TRAVIS: Ask it a question!

2301
02:43:11,503 --> 02:43:13,389
SAM: Oh! I talk to it?

2302
02:43:13,389 --> 02:43:17,041
TRAVIS: Yeah! And it'll talk right back, it's like
that!

2303
02:43:17,041 --> 02:43:29,991
SAM: Oi, Craven Edge. Have you been talking to my
friend Grog?

2304
02:43:29,991 --> 02:43:46,299
MATT: There's a long beat of silence. And then a
barely audible (annoyed sigh).

2305
02:43:46,299 --> 02:43:49,065
LIAM: Sing to it!

2306
02:43:49,065 --> 02:43:59,388
MATT: All of a sudden, you hear this tiny voice
creep up in the back of your head: "If you truly

2307
02:43:59,388 --> 02:44:11,315
"wish to hold me in your grasp, I require you to
prove to me your worthiness."

2308
02:44:11,315 --> 02:44:15,487
TRAVIS: Is it saying something?

2309
02:44:15,487 --> 02:44:17,645
SAM: No.

2310
02:44:17,645 --> 02:44:20,486
TRAVIS: No?! It's not saying anything?!

2311
02:44:20,486 --> 02:44:28,128
SAM: Craven Edge? How do I prove I'm worthy?

2312
02:44:28,128 --> 02:44:29,499
TRAVIS: What?

2313
02:44:29,499 --> 02:44:33,872
(laughing)

2314
02:44:33,872 --> 02:44:40,740
MATT: The blade, all of a sudden, it almost seems
to have a slight shift of its own, like a divining

2315
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:46,579
rod, and it moves. And the blade shifts away from
the direction of you and Grog and gently shifts

2316
02:44:46,579 --> 02:44:53,157
down the way to an older gentleman who's now
returned to picking a few crops and it points in

2317
02:44:53,157 --> 02:44:58,187
his direction and says, "Prove to me."

2318
02:44:58,187 --> 02:44:59,956
LAURA: Is it Reggie?

2319
02:44:59,956 --> 02:45:01,355
MATT: Pointing to Reginald.

2320
02:45:01,355 --> 02:45:02,545
LAURA: No!

2321
02:45:02,545 --> 02:45:03,758
MARISHA: Not Reggie!

2322
02:45:03,758 --> 02:45:06,312
TRAVIS: Why are you pointing it at Reggie?

2323
02:45:06,312 --> 02:45:17,156
SAM: I don't think I can. I don't think I want to.
So I think I'll try to give the sword back to Grog.

2324
02:45:17,156 --> 02:45:19,225
MATT: Make a charisma check.

2325
02:45:19,225 --> 02:45:24,587
SAM: Is this magic?

2326
02:45:24,587 --> 02:45:35,321
MATT: It's not a spell. Let me double-check, if
you're referring to the gnomish racial capability.

2327
02:45:35,321 --> 02:45:38,422
Let me go ahead and check the rules here, because
this could make a difference here.

2328
02:45:38,422 --> 02:45:42,413
SAM: Well, it's fine.

2329
02:45:42,413 --> 02:45:46,823
MATT: Against magic? I'll say yes, because it's
technically a magical entity.

2330
02:45:46,823 --> 02:45:49,815
SAM: Natural 20.

2331
02:45:49,815 --> 02:45:54,085
TALIESIN: Witchcraft!

2332
02:45:54,085 --> 02:45:58,468
MATT: The sheer force of personality that begins
to exude from this weapon, you sense that it is

2333
02:45:58,468 --> 02:46:05,234
old, it has seen many a hand, and has probably
taken far many more a life. But it's not met a

2334
02:46:05,234 --> 02:46:08,004
gnome like you before, Scanlan Shorthalt.

2335
02:46:08,004 --> 02:46:12,415
TALIESIN: (singing) Never known a gnome like you
before!

2336
02:46:12,415 --> 02:46:14,555
SAM: Take this back, will you?

2337
02:46:14,555 --> 02:46:20,608
TRAVIS: Yeah! I take it back. It talked to you,
then, yeah?

2338
02:46:20,608 --> 02:46:22,788
SAM: Yes, it did.

2339
02:46:22,788 --> 02:46:24,912
TRAVIS: Right, it's creepy as shit.

2340
02:46:24,912 --> 02:46:31,077
SAM: It's very compelling. I don't know if you
should have this, Grog.

2341
02:46:31,077 --> 02:46:35,807
TRAVIS: (confused sputtering) Now, hold on! I just
wanted to make sure that I wasn't fucking, you

2342
02:46:35,807 --> 02:46:41,431
know, batshit crazy, which I'm not! And I'm really
glad that we're sharing in this now. But hey!

2343
02:46:41,431 --> 02:46:51,737
Hey! Don't tell anyone. Promise me.

2344
02:46:51,737 --> 02:46:59,013
SAM: All right. I won't tell anyone. But I might
have to ask some questions about this.

2345
02:46:59,013 --> 02:47:02,868
TRAVIS: No, that's why I brought you in! You're
all smart, right? And I always want to ask

2346
02:47:02,868 --> 02:47:07,149
questions like, what's the first thing it
remembers, what was it doing with Lord Briarwood--?

2347
02:47:07,149 --> 02:47:09,177
SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

2348
02:47:09,177 --> 02:47:10,352
TRAVIS: No!

2349
02:47:10,352 --> 02:47:12,747
SAM: A lot? I know it does, it just told me to
kill something.

2350
02:47:12,747 --> 02:47:15,120
TRAVIS: You must be a dark wizard.

2351
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:18,153
SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

2352
02:47:18,153 --> 02:47:20,216
TRAVIS: No! It just says it's hungry.

2353
02:47:20,216 --> 02:47:27,277
MATT: At which point, you both hear a voice
simultaneously go, "Always hungry."

2354
02:47:27,277 --> 02:47:28,526
SAM: Yeah!

2355
02:47:28,526 --> 02:47:32,996
TRAVIS: You heard it that time! Holy shit! I feel
like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams and you're

2356
02:47:32,996 --> 02:47:36,541
James Earl Jones! I've got a friend in this now!

2357
02:47:36,541 --> 02:47:39,539
(laughing)

2358
02:47:39,539 --> 02:47:43,634
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

2359
02:47:43,634 --> 02:47:47,662
TRAVIS: Right, so, look, you know.

2360
02:47:47,662 --> 02:47:49,998
SAM: We should not tell the others about this.
This is very strange.

2361
02:47:49,998 --> 02:47:50,937
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2362
02:47:50,937 --> 02:47:51,999
SAM: They might freak out.

2363
02:47:51,999 --> 02:47:52,808
TRAVIS: Right!

2364
02:47:52,808 --> 02:47:56,463
SAM: I'm going to ask about this. When next we see
Pike, I'll ask her about it.

2365
02:47:56,463 --> 02:47:57,591
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2366
02:47:57,591 --> 02:48:03,553
SAM: Find out if it's good or bad or neutral.
Because I don't know anything about this. Right, I

2367
02:48:03,553 --> 02:48:05,296
don't know anything about this?

2368
02:48:05,296 --> 02:48:06,977
MATT: Make an arcana check.

2369
02:48:06,977 --> 02:48:08,848
TRAVIS: It could be good; there's nothing wrong
with being hungry.

2370
02:48:08,848 --> 02:48:10,302
SAM: 12.

2371
02:48:10,302 --> 02:48:12,653
MATT: 12. It seems magical.

2372
02:48:12,653 --> 02:48:17,008
SAM: Yeah, I don't know. Don't know anything about
this.

2373
02:48:17,008 --> 02:48:24,924
MATT: As a bard, you understand that there are
certain artifacts, weapons that either upon their

2374
02:48:24,924 --> 02:48:30,758
creation, upon their development, had the essence
of a creature or soul put into it. Or, conversely,

2375
02:48:30,758 --> 02:48:39,903
the weapon came into being as its own personality.
You're not sure of the nature of this, and you're

2376
02:48:39,903 --> 02:48:44,779
unable to ascertain which side of the spectrum it
lies on as far as morality goes.

2377
02:48:44,779 --> 02:48:50,695
SAM: I'll do some investigating. In the meantime,
try not to kill anyone in our party.

2378
02:48:50,695 --> 02:48:53,697
If it tells you to.

2379
02:48:53,697 --> 02:48:55,273
TRAVIS: I would never!

2380
02:48:55,273 --> 02:48:56,200
SAM: Well.

2381
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:57,155
TRAVIS: Never!

2382
02:48:57,155 --> 02:48:58,034
SAM: Okay.

2383
02:48:58,034 --> 02:48:59,894
TRAVIS: No, yeah there's never even, like--

2384
02:48:59,894 --> 02:49:01,189
SAM: Let's just keep this between us.

2385
02:49:01,189 --> 02:49:02,560
TRAVIS: Yeah, totes.

2386
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:05,641
SAM: Just like that time in Emon when we--

2387
02:49:05,641 --> 02:49:06,593
TRAVIS: Yep!

2388
02:49:06,593 --> 02:49:07,386
SAM: --double-teamed--

2389
02:49:07,386 --> 02:49:10,115
TRAVIS: The Eiffel Tower!

2390
02:49:10,115 --> 02:49:11,001
SAM: Yep!

2391
02:49:11,001 --> 02:49:12,074
TRAVIS: Yep! All right!

2392
02:49:12,074 --> 02:49:13,388
SAM: It was a--

2393
02:49:13,388 --> 02:49:14,951
TALIESIN: Oh, that went up my nose!

2394
02:49:14,951 --> 02:49:17,695
LAURA: Ugh!

2395
02:49:17,695 --> 02:49:21,930
MATT: At which point, a few clusters of wind come
landing out of the sky.

2396
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:23,177
MARISHA: What? Green lights?

2397
02:49:23,177 --> 02:49:24,084
LAURA: That's us.

2398
02:49:24,084 --> 02:49:25,514
MATT: You guys, you're the mist!

2399
02:49:25,514 --> 02:49:27,724
MARISHA: (panicked yelling) Oh! It's just me!

2400
02:49:27,724 --> 02:49:30,586
TALIESIN: You're literally just scared of your
hands.

2401
02:49:30,586 --> 02:49:32,565
MARISHA: (relieved) Oh!

2402
02:49:32,565 --> 02:49:34,929
TRAVIS: What did--

2403
02:49:34,929 --> 02:49:36,566
SAM: Nothing happened here. How was your trip?

2404
02:49:36,566 --> 02:49:37,756
TRAVIS: Yeah, boring here.

2405
02:49:37,756 --> 02:49:38,593
LAURA: Totally boring?

2406
02:49:38,593 --> 02:49:39,777
TRAVIS: Yep. No action.

2407
02:49:39,777 --> 02:49:44,212
LAURA: You know, not a lot to see there. There's a
lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys

2408
02:49:44,212 --> 02:49:47,660
walking around, oppressing very nice-looking
people.

2409
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:48,875
TRAVIS: A lot of goliaths?

2410
02:49:48,875 --> 02:49:52,573
MARISHA: They've made really poky fences
everywhere.

2411
02:49:52,573 --> 02:49:53,887
TRAVIS: That's what I'd do.

2412
02:49:53,887 --> 02:50:03,257
LAURA: It looks like if we barged in, straight in,
they'd probably have very good fortifications.

2413
02:50:03,257 --> 02:50:04,470
TRAVIS: Right.

2414
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:06,694
MARISHA: I also think they're trying to be scary.

2415
02:50:06,694 --> 02:50:08,917
TRAVIS: Trying to be scary?

2416
02:50:08,917 --> 02:50:14,948
MARISHA: Not that you're not scary all the time,
Grog. I just think they're like, ooh.

2417
02:50:14,948 --> 02:50:16,634
LAURA: They really want to look scary.

2418
02:50:16,634 --> 02:50:18,760
MARISHA: They really want to look tough, yeah.

2419
02:50:18,760 --> 02:50:25,237
LAURA: So, here's the thing. Do we barge in,
totally risk our lives? Or try to find a way

2420
02:50:25,237 --> 02:50:28,689
around this situation?

2421
02:50:28,689 --> 02:50:31,474
SAM: There's a central stronghold of some sort?

2422
02:50:31,474 --> 02:50:32,472
TALIESIN: Yes.

2423
02:50:32,472 --> 02:50:33,586
SAM: Is it a fortress?

2424
02:50:33,586 --> 02:50:35,407
LAURA: It's where the mayor lived before.

2425
02:50:35,407 --> 02:50:36,481
SAM: It's a house?

2426
02:50:36,481 --> 02:50:37,955
LAURA: Yeah, it's like a big house.

2427
02:50:37,955 --> 02:50:39,577
TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's a nice house.

2428
02:50:39,577 --> 02:50:45,478
SAM: And if we were to make our way into it,
somehow, what would our mission be?

2429
02:50:45,478 --> 02:50:52,471
LIAM: Well, let's put on the table what we're
doing here. Right? Kevdak has the Knuckles. We

2430
02:50:52,471 --> 02:50:57,392
don't know where he is. He's probably pretty
formidable on his own. And in a day or two, a

2431
02:50:57,392 --> 02:51:02,620
dragon is going to be swinging by, so it's not one
problem, it's a very large problem

2432
02:51:02,620 --> 02:51:04,178
and a <i>massive</i> problem.

2433
02:51:04,178 --> 02:51:05,469
TRAVIS: Agreed.

2434
02:51:05,469 --> 02:51:12,823
LAURA: I wonder if Kevdak goes to the sacrificial
area where they leave the hoard for the dragon.

2435
02:51:12,823 --> 02:51:14,979
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

2436
02:51:14,979 --> 02:51:18,810
MARISHA: Or if he does rounds to check in on people.

2437
02:51:18,810 --> 02:51:24,684
TALIESIN: I'll also say I think it's more than
likely that, in the end, I doubt the dragons would

2438
02:51:24,684 --> 02:51:27,941
care who is filling the sacrificial plate.

2439
02:51:27,941 --> 02:51:29,450
LAURA: As long as someone is.

2440
02:51:29,450 --> 02:51:30,728
TALIESIN: As long as the plate's full.

2441
02:51:30,728 --> 02:51:40,196
TRAVIS: As far as this city goes, correct me if
I'm wrong, but we have two options. Either we

2442
02:51:40,196 --> 02:51:49,218
stealth in with the stealthy people, not me
included, and we try and pickpocket Kevdak for the

2443
02:51:49,218 --> 02:51:56,203
Knuckles. Or I challenge Kevdak for the Knuckles.

2444
02:51:56,203 --> 02:52:02,676
MARISHA: Is Kevdak known to ever wander off by
himself? Does he take interest in his subjects to

2445
02:52:02,676 --> 02:52:04,338
where we could corner him alone?

2446
02:52:04,338 --> 02:52:07,879
LAURA: Or is it a walk in and try to challenge
him?

2447
02:52:07,879 --> 02:52:11,293
SAM: We could take out that guard, what was his
name, Cole or something?

2448
02:52:11,293 --> 02:52:14,562
TRAVIS: Yeah, Cole was heading back to the city,
though.

2449
02:52:14,562 --> 02:52:18,136
SAM: Well, we could find one of your goliath
friends, hold them hostage,

2450
02:52:18,136 --> 02:52:20,251
and draw out Kevdak that way.

2451
02:52:20,251 --> 02:52:23,539
TRAVIS: They won't care about a hostage.

2452
02:52:23,539 --> 02:52:26,522
MARISHA: There also could be the issue of are they
going to go looking for Horace?

2453
02:52:26,522 --> 02:52:30,865
TRAVIS: Maybe. Not that hard, though.

2454
02:52:30,865 --> 02:52:37,177
SAM: We could do some sort of a diversion, set a
fire or something that would draw them out. Or set

2455
02:52:37,177 --> 02:52:39,447
a fire to the house they live in.

2456
02:52:39,447 --> 02:52:41,723
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea. What would bring
Kevdak out?

2457
02:52:41,723 --> 02:52:43,736
TALIESIN: Grog. Grog would bring Kevdak out.

2458
02:52:43,736 --> 02:52:44,918
MARISHA: Grog?

2459
02:52:44,918 --> 02:52:48,211
SAM: Do you want to march in there, solo, while we
stealth--

2460
02:52:48,211 --> 02:52:49,290
LAURA: <i>No!</i>

2461
02:52:49,290 --> 02:52:54,614
SAM: No, no, while we all stealth around in the
rooftops watching, ready to act.

2462
02:52:54,614 --> 02:53:03,219
LIAM: Grog, I'm curious how tied you feel to the
ways of your people now, or if you do. Do you feel

2463
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:09,620
the need, yourself, to face him on your own, or
would you be amenable, would you be friendly to

2464
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:14,971
the idea of my sister and I softening him up for a
moment, and then letting you have at it? What do

2465
02:53:14,971 --> 02:53:18,333
you want to do here?

2466
02:53:18,333 --> 02:53:30,752
TRAVIS: So my fear is this: that if it's anyone
but me and him, everyone gets involved. Not just

2467
02:53:30,752 --> 02:53:38,750
us, but all 60 of them in that stronghold. I don't
think we walk out of that very well. I'm not

2468
02:53:38,750 --> 02:53:46,834
opposed to facing him head-on and seeing what fate
has in store for me while you free any prisoners

2469
02:53:46,834 --> 02:53:53,093
that might be around, or ransacking his house for
any fun bits, but I think he's going to have the

2470
02:53:53,093 --> 02:53:54,995
Knuckles on him.

2471
02:53:54,995 --> 02:54:04,074
MARISHA: Question. Is your herd and Kevdak the
type where, if you start getting the upper hand in

2472
02:54:04,074 --> 02:54:07,760
this fight, will the herd move to protect Kevdak?

2473
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:08,928
TRAVIS: No.

2474
02:54:08,928 --> 02:54:15,114
MARISHA: So they'll honor a one-on-one fight?
They'll honor that? They won't pull a fast one and

2475
02:54:15,114 --> 02:54:17,394
swarm in when he's on his last leg?

2476
02:54:17,394 --> 02:54:23,937
SAM: Tell us this. If we walk in with you into
town, is that not good? Should you walk into town

2477
02:54:23,937 --> 02:54:26,110
alone and we lurk in the shadows?

2478
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:31,358
MARISHA: Do you want to be on a hilltop, like
standing on a hilltop?

2479
02:54:31,358 --> 02:54:33,363
Because we could arrange that.

2480
02:54:33,363 --> 02:54:45,007
TRAVIS: I would need to think about it.
Regardless, I think now is not the time. Perhaps

2481
02:54:45,007 --> 02:54:48,588
we go look for Osysa's mate.

2482
02:54:48,588 --> 02:54:51,798
SAM: You don't want to do this now? It seems like
now or never!

2483
02:54:51,798 --> 02:54:55,415
MARISHA: We know where Kevdak is, he doesn't seem
to be going anywhere.

2484
02:54:55,415 --> 02:54:57,632
SAM: We may not know where he is after this.

2485
02:54:57,632 --> 02:55:03,115
TRAVIS: He seems pretty fortified. And we don't
have Pike. And this is her hometown.

2486
02:55:03,115 --> 02:55:06,435
MARISHA: Judging by the-- no, I didn't hear any of
that.

2487
02:55:06,435 --> 02:55:12,178
LIAM: I want to throw something in here as well.
And I don't know what to do in this situation, I'm

2488
02:55:12,178 --> 02:55:19,540
looking to you all for guidance. But I do know two
things. One is that I don't want you to fall,

2489
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:29,187
Grog. We need you. And I do not want you to fall
to Kevdak. And second: if you do fall, I'm not

2490
02:55:29,187 --> 02:55:34,495
willing to walk away without those Knuckles, not
for me to use, but for us to use. We need those

2491
02:55:34,495 --> 02:55:41,679
Knuckles. So if you are to fall at his hand, which
I do not want, I don't know that I can honorably

2492
02:55:41,679 --> 02:55:43,287
walk away.

2493
02:55:43,287 --> 02:55:48,891
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, speaking from a selfish
position, if I fall, you can really do whatever

2494
02:55:48,891 --> 02:55:55,686
the fuck you want. I think honor is bupkis at that
point. So I don't mind what you do after that.

2495
02:55:55,686 --> 02:55:57,497
LAURA: You're not going to fall, Grog.

2496
02:55:57,497 --> 02:55:58,807
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

2497
02:55:58,807 --> 02:56:02,544
LIAM: My first point, Grog, I need <i>you</i>, we all
do.

2498
02:56:02,544 --> 02:56:14,114
TRAVIS: That's very sweet. Uh. Emotion. I would
like it if Pike was here.

2499
02:56:14,114 --> 02:56:15,626
TALIESIN: We know.

2500
02:56:15,626 --> 02:56:17,624
LAURA: We wait.

2501
02:56:17,624 --> 02:56:21,783
MARISHA: Look, could we hear Horace when he was
interrogating him?

2502
02:56:21,783 --> 02:56:22,934
MATT: Yeah.

2503
02:56:22,934 --> 02:56:28,886
MARISHA: Judging by the way Horace was speaking,
it sounds like they're pretty settled in for right now.

2504
02:56:28,886 --> 02:56:32,383
TRAVIS: They're not nomadic any more.

2505
02:56:32,383 --> 02:56:35,084
LIAM: Sitting pretty.

2506
02:56:35,084 --> 02:56:37,365
TRAVIS: Yeah, they ain't going anywhere.

2507
02:56:37,365 --> 02:56:47,825
MARISHA: So we know where he is now. It'll give us
a little bit more time to formulate our plan? This is

2508
02:56:47,825 --> 02:56:52,063
your fight, Grog, we'll follow you in this one.

2509
02:56:52,063 --> 02:56:57,792
LAURA: You want to go in there with Pike?

2510
02:56:57,792 --> 02:56:59,000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2511
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,418
MARISHA: Let's wait for Pike.

2512
02:57:00,418 --> 02:57:08,512
LAURA: We wait for Pike. We wait until Gilmore's
up and standing and we bring Pike here with us.

2513
02:57:08,512 --> 02:57:15,027
MARISHA: Pike might even be an emotional trigger.

2514
02:57:15,027 --> 02:57:17,226
LAURA: For what?

2515
02:57:17,226 --> 02:57:19,674
MARISHA: The herd if they see her, maybe.

2516
02:57:19,674 --> 02:57:20,997
LAURA: They never met her.

2517
02:57:20,997 --> 02:57:23,034
MARISHA: That's true. They probably
don't give any shits.

2518
02:57:23,034 --> 02:57:29,392
TRAVIS: Let's just do this. Let's go after Osysa's
mate. If we don't learn or find anything

2519
02:57:29,392 --> 02:57:32,501
incredibly valuable, we're at the same place we
are now.

2520
02:57:32,501 --> 02:57:33,928
MARISHA: Good point.

2521
02:57:33,928 --> 02:57:35,877
TRAVIS: And then we can kick the tires.

2522
02:57:35,877 --> 02:57:38,082
SAM: Do we still have mist possibilities?

2523
02:57:38,082 --> 02:57:39,640
MARISHA: We do, we can float on.

2524
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:42,476
LAURA: Is Reginald still around?

2525
02:57:42,476 --> 02:57:47,008
MATT: You notice that Reginald's sitting there,
clutching his full stachel.

2526
02:57:47,008 --> 02:57:49,713
LAURA: Hi, Reggie!

2527
02:57:49,713 --> 02:57:51,428
MATT: "Hi!"

2528
02:57:51,428 --> 02:57:54,465
LAURA: So we're going to help you.

2529
02:57:54,465 --> 02:57:56,816
MATT: "Right."

2530
02:57:56,816 --> 02:57:58,719
TALIESIN: We're going to go get some
reinforcements.

2531
02:57:58,719 --> 02:58:00,526
LAURA: You might have to wait a little while.

2532
02:58:00,526 --> 02:58:02,634
MATT: "That's okay, but you're coming back,
right?"

2533
02:58:02,634 --> 02:58:09,954
LAURA: We most definitely are. Spread the word
that hope is alive. We will find a way to beat this.

2534
02:58:09,954 --> 02:58:18,774
MATT: "All right. I'll be careful. You be careful,
too. Come back as soon as you think you can, when

2535
02:58:18,774 --> 02:58:19,920
"you're ready."

2536
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:21,836
LAURA: Don't tell anyone what you saw here,
though, right?

2537
02:58:21,836 --> 02:58:25,583
MATT: "Good luck."

2538
02:58:25,583 --> 02:58:31,302
MARISHA: If anyone asks where Horace is, what
happened to Horace?

2539
02:58:31,302 --> 02:58:34,583
MATT: "I haven't seen him for days."

2540
02:58:34,583 --> 02:58:36,496
LAURA: That's a good answer.

2541
02:58:36,496 --> 02:58:44,194
MATT: Spits on the pile where his corpse is. "All
right. Hope to see you soon, then." He turns

2542
02:58:44,194 --> 02:58:46,115
around and begins walking back.

2543
02:58:46,115 --> 02:58:47,685
MARISHA: Reginald.

2544
02:58:47,685 --> 02:58:54,940
MATT: You guys all take a moment, collect
yourselves, revert back to your mist form, coast

2545
02:58:54,940 --> 02:59:00,674
out of the farmland, heading southward in the
direction of the Frostweald. And there, we're

2546
02:59:00,674 --> 02:59:03,157
going to finish our campaign for the evening.

2547
02:59:03,157 --> 02:59:05,036
MARISHA: Ooh, shit!

2548
02:59:05,036 --> 02:59:06,190
LAURA: Man, Grog!

2549
02:59:06,190 --> 02:59:08,935
MARISHA: Grog!

2550
02:59:08,935 --> 02:59:11,771
TALIESIN: Feeling the pressure now? Feel it?

2551
02:59:11,771 --> 02:59:14,058
LIAM: Grog showing restraint and caution!

2552
02:59:14,058 --> 02:59:16,213
LAURA: I like it! I want Pike here, too.

2553
02:59:16,213 --> 02:59:17,672
LIAM: Yeah, so do I.

2554
02:59:17,672 --> 02:59:19,598
TRAVIS: It's too big for Grog.

2555
02:59:19,598 --> 02:59:22,700
SAM: Could have taken them.

2556
02:59:22,700 --> 02:59:24,396
LAURA: You could totally have taken them.

2557
02:59:24,396 --> 02:59:28,020
TRAVIS: Could have. But it's where Pike and her
family raised Grog.

2558
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:29,936
LAURA: Seems appropriate.

2559
02:59:29,936 --> 02:59:33,482
TRAVIS: Her schedule's so busy, but if we can
get her next week...

2560
02:59:33,482 --> 02:59:38,190
TALIESIN: Well, next week we do the sphinx, and
then the week after.

2561
02:59:38,190 --> 02:59:42,444
MATT: We'll figure it out. We'll get her back
sometime soon, right?

2562
02:59:42,444 --> 02:59:44,014
TRAVIS: We do.

2563
02:59:44,014 --> 02:59:46,686
LIAM: If it takes 17 episodes, we will.

2564
02:59:46,686 --> 02:59:50,859
MARISHA: You're in New York. Can you stuff her in
your suitcase while you're there, bring her back?

2565
02:59:50,859 --> 02:59:52,099
LAURA: Good call!

2566
02:59:52,099 --> 02:59:53,874
MARISHA: Just commandeer her, she's tiny!

2567
02:59:53,874 --> 02:59:55,138
LAURA: She's little!

2568
02:59:55,138 --> 02:59:57,477
MARISHA: She might be a little loud.

2569
02:59:57,477 --> 03:00:00,110
LIAM: Skype is rough, guys, it makes me feel bad
for Pike.

2570
03:00:00,110 --> 03:00:03,310
MATT: We'll have you back soon, buddy.

2571
03:00:03,310 --> 03:00:05,018
LIAM: I'm fine.

2572
03:00:05,018 --> 03:00:07,145
MATT: No, you're not! You need to be here!

2573
03:00:07,145 --> 03:00:09,333
LIAM: (fake crying)

2574
03:00:09,333 --> 03:00:16,175
MATT: I know. Hopefully we'll be having Ashley
back when Blindspot releases her between seasons,

2575
03:00:16,175 --> 03:00:17,706
we'll have her back for a few months.

2576
03:00:17,706 --> 03:00:18,919
MARISHA: Season break!

2577
03:00:18,919 --> 03:00:26,307
MATT: Whenever that happens soon. We'll see you
guys back here next week for the next length of

2578
03:00:26,307 --> 03:00:33,853
the journey of Vox Machina. Until then, is it
Thursday yet? See you guys soon.
