1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:03,025
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:05,485
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,747
TRAVIS: (shouting) No, we don't want to!

4
00:00:07,747 --> 00:00:15,928
MATT: Tonight should be a very unique and
climactic evening. I'm glad you could join us for

5
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:20,107
it. Before we jump into it, we have some quick
announcements to get through. First and foremost, our

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:26,898
episode tonight is brought to you by our friends
at Marvel Puzzle Quest. Thank you so much again

7
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:29,861
for coming and being so supportive of the show.
Sam! You have a word to say?

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,649
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest has epic news, guys!
They're celebrating four years strong, starting

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:42,212
today! Today, it's literally the only thing on my
mind. When I heard that Rogue and the other X-Men

10
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:49,490
are kicking off the celebration, I was like,
"Vecna who?!" Forget that an immortal psychopath

11
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:56,367
will probably wipe out three years of hard work on
this show! Give me Marvel Puzzle Quest! Today,

12
00:00:56,367 --> 00:01:01,555
October 5th, is a big day. Not because we're
facing the ultimate harbinger of doom who will

13
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:07,175
surely cut short our lives and story, no, but
because, in 11 days, on October 16th-- until

14
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:12,415
then-- Marvel Puzzle Quest gives you free gifts!
Double XP rewards, including the all-new X-men

15
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:18,708
versus Apocalypse event, which is the only event
I'm thinking of, and the only event that kept me

16
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:26,007
awake last night in a cold sweat until 4:00am. A
cold sweat of excitement for Marvel Puzzle Quest!

17
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:34,233
Did I mention that you can recruit Gambit for the
first time? I'm not crying inside anymore! Did I

18
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:39,330
also mention Nightcrawler is coming later this
month? Nightcrawler, who can teleport around and

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,868
isn't frozen with fear, contemplating his
inevitable demise two hours from now, at the hands

20
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:55,330
of a one-eyed master of hell who will destroy
everything and everyone we've loved! So download

21
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:01,972
Marvel Puzzle Quest now for free on Apple and
Android devices because I'm so happy!

22
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:05,593
TRAVIS: Written through wine and tears.

23
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:12,979
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Marvel Puzzle
Quest. Do we have any merch updates, Laura?

24
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:20,485
LAURA: (fake sobbing) There's shirts and there's
hats and there's hoodies! And there's Tarot cards,

25
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:28,476
and-- No, but seriously, the shirt of Matt, of our
evil DM who's about to kill us all, you can get a

26
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:31,391
shirt that has his face on it, evilly smirking, so
it's perfect.

27
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:35,340
TALIESIN: The last thing Vox Machina ever sees,
immortalized on a shirt. It's the grinning face of

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,429
our destroyer.

29
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:42,645
LAURA: Check it out! There's a ton of stuff
available! It's great. And we've got some really

30
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:46,187
awesome stuff coming up for the holidays, too, so
keep that in mind.

31
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,567
LIAM: Like Critical Role urns to hold the ashes of
your friends!

32
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,960
LAURA: Terrible.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,719
LIAM: It's me.

34
00:02:53,719 --> 00:03:01,972
MATT: For the Critical Role podcast on iTunes, we
have now up to episode 55 released. Hopefully have

35
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:06,880
more announcements as it goes up, as more episodes
are available. So go check it out. Slowly getting

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,789
caught up, piece by piece. Once again, our comic,
Vox Machina: Origins, Critical Role comic through

37
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:20,202
Dark Horse, is available. We're going to have a
new issue coming up in the near future, so very

38
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:26,016
soon. Issue two. Excited for you guys to see it.
Talks Machina is this Tuesday, of course, about

39
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:31,785
this episode. 7:00pm Pacific time, here on Twitch
and Alpha, for our wonderful host, Brian W.

40
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:39,209
Foster. We can all drink together on set. Don't
forget to submit any of your fanart or gifs to

41
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,663
submit@talksmachina.com. Do you have a Wednesday
Club episode coming up, too?

42
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:51,621
TALIESIN: We do. It's October, which is wonderful
and great. We're going to be covering monsters.

43
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:56,315
We're doing monster books. We're going to be
talking about the origins of Groot and some of the

44
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:05,571
big creepy monsters of yesteryear, and some modern
creepy monster books. I, Vampire, and etc. Fun.

45
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:11,939
MATT: Fantastic. Thank you, Taliesin. Also,
apparently, Twitch has extended Sub-tember all the

46
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:18,924
way to Sub-tober! Or at least, up until Twitch
Con, which is in a few weeks. So if you're a first

47
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:24,132
time sub, you get half off for a few more weeks on
every channel. If you want to support this or any

48
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:27,638
of your other favorite channels on Twitch, now is
the time to do it before this goes away, or it

49
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:36,296
becomes Sub-Vember. So check it out, and awesome!
That is all of our announcements, guys.

50
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:38,520
TRAVIS: Wait, wait.

51
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,897
LIAM: I have enough nervous energy to power the US
Navy right now.

52
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,496
LAURA: He's shaking his leg so much. Don't move
your leg!

53
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:49,788
MARISHA: Going to have blood pressure issues after
this.

54
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:57,447
MATT: Well, let's carry that energy onward as we
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role!

55
00:04:57,447 --> 00:06:28,704
[dramatic music]

56
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:40,317
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off, Vox
Machina had been traveling for a means of stopping

57
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:46,616
the ascension of the Whispered One, Vecna, the
lich seeking ascension to godhood. Unfortunately

58
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:52,534
failed to do so, as he transported his Shadowfell
city of Thar Amphala into the Prime Material

59
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:58,924
world. Using the Ritual of Seeding that was once
responsible for bringing the Raven Queen into the

60
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:04,890
pantheon brought him as well as the sole god on
this side of the Divine Gate, and possible

61
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:15,845
god-ruler of the Prime Material Plane. Using the
power of his worshippers and of his newfound

62
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:23,345
abilities in his avatar god form, he gave
temporary undead life to a long-buried, dead,

63
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:29,926
Primordial Earth Titan that lay deep beneath the
ground in Issylra. It has begun hulking its way,

64
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:36,549
closer and closer toward the Dawn Cradle, the city
of Vasselheim, as you, traversing through the

65
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:42,146
innards of this titan, making your way within the
city of Thar Amphala, sneakily finding your way

66
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:47,735
beneath the dome, which he had constructed to keep
outside any of the assailing forces. You managed

67
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:54,686
to defeat and destroy Delilah, made an ally of
Arkhan, the oathbreaker paladin dragonborn, sent

68
00:07:54,686 --> 00:08:01,832
Sylas off to recover, and hopefully have enough
time. You ascended the tower of Entropis, where

69
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:08,701
you fell into one of a number of traps that Vecna
had laid out for you, causing you to kill two,

70
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:14,834
almost three, of your closest friends and family.
Managing to recover them within an inch of

71
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:22,401
irrecoverability, you sent them with Gilmore off
to safety as the black knight made its way up the

72
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:27,319
staircase, Arkhan heading it off at the pass,
giving you the opportunity to rise up to the top

73
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:36,832
of the tower to face Vecna, the Ascended. You
quickly take these last 20 or so seconds as you

74
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:41,728
rush up the steps, one after the other, your
heartbeat pulsing through your body, your breath

75
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:48,647
coming in and out with staggered beats. Vox
Machina, what do you want to do with these last 20

76
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,230
seconds?

77
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,182
LAURA: I'm going to take out a vial of holy oil,
and I'm going to dip my needle arrows that Tary

78
00:08:54,182 --> 00:09:00,021
gave me into the holy oil. I'm going to pour the
remainder on Trinket's claws.

79
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:06,931
SAM: How far are we from the entry to this
chamber, or whatever?

80
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:15,312
MATT: You're not entirely certain. As you guys are
ascending, you begin to see a peek of greenish

81
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:20,060
light that's peeking up ahead, starting to
brighten the spiral staircase as you ascend. You

82
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,586
get the sense you're getting close.

83
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:32,371
SAM: When we get 20 feet away from it, 15 feet
away from it, I'm going to cast Unseen Servant and

84
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:43,888
hand him my whip. Tell Scanlan Two: buddy, I need
you, but not right away. When this whip falls,

85
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,925
come in the room.

86
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:49,869
LAURA: Oh! No!

87
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:57,650
MATT: The secondary Scanlan takes a moment, looks
at you, nods. "Okay."

88
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,753
SAM: I believe in you, buddy. I've always believed
in Number Two.

89
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:11,499
MATT: "Truer words were never spoken. And if you
fall, I'll tell the tale of the Scanlan that left

90
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,131
"me with his Number Two Whip."

91
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,563
SAM: I love you, buddy.

92
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:18,764
MATT: "I love you, too." You're not sure if you
should go in for a kiss or not.

93
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,597
SAM: We shake hands.

94
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:26,626
TRAVIS: I'm waiting. I'm waiting to see our foe
before I smash.

95
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,130
MATT: For the record, as the ascent and the time
it's cast, you'll probably arrive at the top of

96
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:37,167
the tower with about-- for the purposes of
gameplay and time wishy-washiness, I'll give you

97
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:43,054
about 30 seconds, once the encounter starts, in
which the Haste will remain. 25 to 30.

98
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:48,026
LIAM: While that conversation was happening, I tug
Keyleth back and the wings flex out and around in

99
00:10:48,026 --> 00:11:03,134
a bit of a shell around us. Quickly. Forever and
ever and always. I steal what I assume is my last

100
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:09,785
kiss. Let's go.

101
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:17,589
ASHLEY: Oh no, I'm already crying! We haven't
started!

102
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,259
SAM: Why can't we hear you?

103
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,593
ASHLEY: Wait, can you hear me?

104
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,319
LAURA: There, now we can!

105
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:38,511
ASHLEY: Before we go out there, let's hold hands
real quick. Just know, I love you guys so much and

106
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:46,895
you're my family. We're going to make it through
this, okay? I'm going to cast Holy Aura on

107
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,799
everybody.

108
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,697
SAM: What's that? What does that do?

109
00:11:50,697 --> 00:12:00,595
ASHLEY: Okay, basically, if you stay within 30
feet of me-- I can't even read this because my

110
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:10,630
eyes are watering. You have advantage on all
saving throws and other creatures have

111
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,653
disadvantage on attack rolls.

112
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:16,188
LIAM: All saves.

113
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,979
SAM: Wait, Matt's correcting you.

114
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:23,330
MATT: Interesting point of order. They don't have
to be within 30 feet of you for it to affect you.

115
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,252
It looks like as long as they're within 30 feet of
you when you cast it, then you guys can run

116
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,558
anywhere.

117
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:32,194
TRAVIS: Are you serious?! That's even better!

118
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:37,060
LAURA: Okay, so advantage on saving throws?
Anybody attacking us gets disadvantage?

119
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,926
MARISHA: Is that on melee attacks, or all
attacks?

120
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,755
MATT: Attack rolls.

121
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:47,336
ASHLEY: When a fiend or undead hits an affected
creature with a melee attack, the Aura flashes a

122
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:51,998
brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a
constitution saving throw or be blinded until the

123
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:53,280
spell ends.

124
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,018
TRAVIS: That's fucking great.

125
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,579
TALIESIN: That'll do.

126
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,866
SAM: Why haven't we always used this?

127
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:04,414
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it. She's been at her
books.

128
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,650
LIAM: She's all growed up.

129
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:17,173
MATT: Heading up the stairs, the greenish light of
the surface greets you as you break toward the top

130
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:22,323
of the tower. This ascent is somewhat familiar to
Keyleth, having seen this exact arrival once

131
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:27,193
before, as you were originally scrying on the
death knight. As soon as you hit the peak, the

132
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:33,639
wind sends your hair behind you and scattering
across your face. As you can see, the extremely

133
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:40,526
strong cyclone that encapsulates the top of this
tower is now swirling around you. There are

134
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:47,399
occasional breaks in the clouds, where you see
glimpses of the sprawling city of Vasselheim right

135
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,811
below you. You see the titan's feet have already
breached the outer walls and have begun crushing

136
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:59,807
their way through the Braving Grounds of the city.
Columns of smoke swirl upward to engulf the

137
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:04,641
behemoth's legs with each impact. You get the
sense the entire city is leaned forward as it's

138
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:11,496
begun to assault thousands upon thousands of
soldiers that have swarmed up toward the base of

139
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:16,671
the creature. You can see arrow and spell being
flung from a distance. You can see other flying

140
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:21,968
soldiers, wyvern-riders, eagle-riders, across the
way that are crashing into gloomstalker clouds

141
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:27,397
that are swooping down to engulf the skies above
the city, as the four giant arms of this titan

142
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:32,922
continue to pummel and smash, tossing large towers
and temples, breaking into bits of rubble and

143
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:40,590
rock. You can see hundreds of warriors man siege
weapons against this unstoppable, ancient threat

144
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,155
as giant rocks and boulders go flying past,
slamming the sides of the giant dome that still

145
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:49,940
remain holding. However, there you can see the
large wedge that you had already left free and

146
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,025
open, where the soldiers that managed to break
through the initial onslaught of the gloomstalkers

147
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,118
are beginning to swarm in and try and make their
way in your direction.

148
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:05,761
Bolts of green energy crackle and fork through the
swirling clouds around you. Your eyes creep upward

149
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:15,562
to lock onto the terrifying avatar form of Vecna
the Ascended. The Undying King-made-God is now a

150
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:24,076
huge skeletal lich body, floating about 40 feet
above the tower, staring down at you, tendrils of

151
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:30,365
screaming souls entwined within his limbs, and the
tome he has clutched in his right hand. Stretching

152
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:38,139
with every gesture, you see the faces screech and
cry in pain as they're withered and torn as his

153
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:44,973
arms shift downward to greet you. The gaping left
socket is almost blinding with crackling power,

154
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:53,064
arcs of arcane tethers crawling across his chest
and face. His left hand, however, is whole.

155
00:15:53,064 --> 00:16:04,412
Seemingly recovered a part of his previous power.
The hand of Vecna appears to have been reattached.

156
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:13,482
The artifact now pulses with the same green energy
that sparks from his voided socket. Across his

157
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:20,789
long tattered red robes and his dark golden armor,
his ribcage glows from within, sending beams of

158
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:28,479
sickly green light out at each gap. And there,
floating in the bones, the faint outline of a

159
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:35,195
small humanoid form locked within. Make a
perception check, everyone.

160
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,731
LAURA: What?

161
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:39,052
MARISHA: Who is it, though?

162
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,511
TRAVIS: Nine.

163
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:43,537
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

164
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,074
LAURA: 31.

165
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,264
LIAM: 24.

166
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:48,493
SAM: Eight.

167
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:49,458
MARISHA: 21.

168
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,695
ASHLEY: 25.

169
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:59,696
MATT: Ooh, nice. So you five look up to see an
unconscious little girl, of human and elven

170
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:10,607
descent. Velora floats, encased within the ribcage
of the avatar form. She appears to be in some sort

171
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:19,286
of a trance and is held by nothing but air and
energy. A terrible familiar smile creeps across

172
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:28,230
the face, his thin mummified lips curling into an
impossibly long exaggerated smile that defies the

173
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:40,677
constraints of the skull that held it. "I was
curious who would seek my blessing first. You all

174
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:49,573
"have proven driven enough to deserve the personal
touch of my wrath. When I discovered your wily

175
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:59,015
"tricks merely shifting about beneath my nose, the
humor of it was not lost on me. This omniscience

176
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:09,676
"is still new. I learned to push my limits with
each passing moment. I thank you for showing me. I

177
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:17,616
"reward you by sharing with you the ruin of this
once beautiful city, a familiar oblivion to you

178
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:24,845
"each, now perfected." I would like you all to
please place yourselves.

179
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:29,389
SAM: It's so simple and beautiful.

180
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,516
MATT: You've arrived.

181
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:34,075
TRAVIS: I feel like it's not what we think it
is.

182
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:38,721
MATT: Place yourselves around this entrance in
what order you would've ascended to this point.

183
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:44,171
LAURA: Where's Vecna?

184
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,954
SAM: What is that thing in the middle?

185
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:51,168
MATT: I'll show you once you place yourselves
based on how you ascended.

186
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:55,190
TRAVIS: We're right near the entrance, right, no
further?

187
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,808
LAURA: Everybody just came out and we're standing
in a big clump right here.

188
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:06,542
MATT: Unless you wanted to scatter, let's say
about anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from where the

189
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:13,021
entrance is as you rush out to look over the side
of the wall. All right, we have Percival over here.

190
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,057
LAURA: I'm on the other side of Percival.

191
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:17,359
MARISHA: Can you move Keyleth to where Percival
was?

192
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,246
MATT: So I'll say over here?

193
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:20,905
SAM: I'll be next to Grog.

194
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:33,573
LIAM: Where's Vex now? She's over there? I'm going
to go to the side of this glowy thing. Can I get there?

195
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,369
MATT: You can get about this far. For just the
ascension.

196
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:41,126
ASHLEY: I'm going to be close to Grog, too.

197
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:47,407
TRAVIS: The action that I held coming 
up the stairs. Can I cast Enlarge?

198
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,671
MATT: I'll say you can do that as he's speaking.

199
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:53,887
LIAM: Can I get any farther with my wings out? I
popped them out before we came up.

200
00:19:53,887 --> 00:20:04,918
MATT: Then (whooshing). There's Grog. We'll say
you can get, for the sake of placement, about 20 feet up.

201
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:10,982
LIAM: No, I wanted to hover like five feet
above--

202
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:16,965
MATT: To this side? Because you have your wings
out, sure. I'll let you get there.

203
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:22,745
LAURA: Trinket is going to stay right at the
entrance.

204
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:24,022
MATT: Right there?

205
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,092
LAURA: Yeah.

206
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,380
Good boy.

207
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,137
SAM: Guard that entrance.

208
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,917
LAURA: He's just waiting to see what's going on.

209
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,810
SAM: This is fine.

210
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,224
LAURA: Oh my god!

211
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:40,270
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

212
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,330
MARISHA: That's amazing.

213
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,087
SAM: What!

214
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:47,640
MARISHA: Can you see this, Ash?

215
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,713
ASHLEY: I just see a lot of swirls.

216
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:54,479
MARISHA: Ash, I'm going to take a picture and
send it to you.

217
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:57,399
LAURA: Make sure you get his good side.

218
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:00,075
SAM: Oh man, he looks so cool.

219
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:05,994
LAURA: Did you do this, Matthew? You made this,
didn't you? You painted it?

220
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:09,408
MATT: Well, I had friends help me, because I've
been planning a wedding.

221
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:11,919
LIAM: Before he started, that was Optimus Prime.

222
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,541
(laughter)

223
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,053
MATT: That was actually converted from my Critter
gift a while back.

224
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,090
LAURA: Really?

225
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,911
MATT: Yeah. So even the community helped. So to
give you some perspective in size to his newly

226
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:28,931
ascended avatar form, all of his power focused
into a single, physical entity, that is the Vecna

227
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,179
produced since the Ritual of Seeding.

228
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,921
TRAVIS: Shit.

229
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,682
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

230
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:38,599
(screaming)

231
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,274
ASHLEY: Holy crap.

232
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,034
TRAVIS: Let's do this. Here we go.

233
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,842
SAM: Can I inspire myself for this roll?

234
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:47,295
MATT: It's an ability check, I think, right?

235
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,220
SAM: Yeah, but I don't have a turn.

236
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,198
LAURA: I already forgot. It's like I just walked
into Target. I've lost all brain function.

237
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:58,984
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Hey, not bad!

238
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,570
LIAM: Thanks Gil.

239
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:11,463
MATT: There we go. Now we got the music going. All
right. So 30 to 25?

240
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,688
TRAVIS: 27.

241
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,218
LAURA: 25.

242
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:21,432
MATT: 25 to 20?

243
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,909
LIAM: 22.

244
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,018
TRAVIS: Why are you all so fucking quiet over
there?

245
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,347
MATT: 20 to 15?

246
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,351
TALIESIN: 15.

247
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:30,643
MARISHA: 17.

248
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:36,235
MATT: And Percival. 15 to ten?

249
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:39,760
TRAVIS: Fucking gnomes! What happened?

250
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,372
MATT: Ten to five?

251
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,699
SAM: Eight.

252
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,902
LAURA: Ashley, what did you roll?

253
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,248
ASHLEY: Two!

254
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,774
(laughter)

255
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:50,435
LIAM: It's like a chime.

256
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,429
ASHLEY: Off to a good start.

257
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,066
SAM: Unless I can inspire myself.

258
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,944
MATT: If you want to.

259
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:59,963
SAM: I mean, I'm not going to get anywhere higher
in the order.

260
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:04,823
LAURA: You might go before whatever some of the
shit that he doles out. He's just going to

261
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:06,423
consistently dole shit out.

262
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:11,186
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is awful.

263
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:13,074
MATT: Vecna goes first.

264
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:16,431
LAURA: Of course he does, he's a god!

265
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:18,427
MARISHA: You've got to be fucking kidding me.

266
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:29,416
MATT: As he stands above, he lifts his hand. You
watch as the atmosphere above, at the outskirts of

267
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:36,430
this cyclone above the city, a tear in space and
time begins to rip. A familiar sound you've heard

268
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:44,784
once before. You watch as giant flaming rocks,
three of them, go firing down into Vasselheim. You

269
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:52,816
watch as the apex of the temple of Kord gets
impacted and crumbles down to one side in a

270
00:23:52,816 --> 00:24:00,166
flaming ruin. You watch as a secondary one slams
down into the center of the city, in a familiar

271
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:13,252
district to you, Pike. And a third one goes arcing
off towards the temple of the Raven Queen. And

272
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:21,008
with a distant explosion, the flash encompasses
that vicinity. This is what you would notice, if

273
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:24,476
the fourth one didn't come flying straight for the
top of the tower.

274
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:26,880
TRAVIS: Goddamn it. It's personal now.

275
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:36,621
MATT: As it slams into the center of the tower
apex, I need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw.

276
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:43,481
LAURA: Everybody gets advantage. Yes, and he gets
disadvantage on things against us.

277
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:47,424
LIAM: We get advantage on saves from Pike's
spell.

278
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,749
MATT: That's correct.

279
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:57,688
LAURA: Any spell from an evil creature that
attacks me takes 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone.

280
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,323
MATT: That's correct. So go ahead and roll the
damage.

281
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:02,828
LIAM: Is Grog within ten feet of me?

282
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:07,118
MATT: Grog is, yes.

283
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:08,510
LIAM: Then you get plus two from me.

284
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,232
MARISHA: Oh yeah, did everyone pop their
blessings?

285
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:22,893
LAURA: Yeah, we all popped our blessings. Yes,
Pelor! 12 radiant damage. Woo!

286
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,132
SAM: Hey, I think he's looking pretty rough.

287
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,874
LAURA: He's bloodied. He's definitely bloodied.

288
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,477
MATT: So what did you get?

289
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:29,617
TRAVIS: 17.

290
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:33,202
LAURA: Oh, for saving throws? Sorry, I rolled
my--

291
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,720
SAM: With advantage.

292
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,779
LAURA: And what is this? Saving throw for
dexterity?

293
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,263
MATT: Yes.

294
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,875
MARISHA: I get to add plus four right, because
we're blessed?

295
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,602
LIAM: d4, that's right.

296
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:47,131
LAURA: 29. Plus three. That's 32.

297
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:48,878
TRAVIS: 17.

298
00:25:48,878 --> 00:25:50,244
MATT: Fail.

299
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,347
LAURA: 32.

300
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:52,416
MATT: Success.

301
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,427
LIAM: 30.

302
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,311
MATT: Success.

303
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,054
MARISHA: 21.

304
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:55,956
MATT: Fail.

305
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:56,837
TALIESIN: 15.

306
00:25:56,837 --> 00:25:57,686
MATT: Fail.

307
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,301
SAM: Natural 20. 26.

308
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,068
MATT: Just succeeds.

309
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:05,633
LAURA: Wait, if we roll a natural 20, that doesn't
mean it's an automatic success? We still have to

310
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,063
add numbers to it?

311
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:09,541
SAM: Ones are an automatic fail, twenties are not
successes, right?

312
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:13,762
MATT: With a skill set. With a saving throw, I
generally consider a natural 20 an auto-success.

313
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:16,450
But letting you know, that's still barely a pass.

314
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,840
TRAVIS: 25 is his--

315
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,205
SAM: DC.

316
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,261
MATT: 26.

317
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,786
TRAVIS: 26 is?

318
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:25,887
MATT: He just made it. Pike, what did you roll?

319
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:29,416
ASHLEY: 20. Not a natural 20, but 19 plus one.

320
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:35,254
MATT: So everyone who failed, you take 67 points
of bludgeoning damage. Halved if you succeeded.

321
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,645
MARISHA: 67?

322
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:38,948
LAURA: So 34?

323
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:41,288
MATT: And 66 points of fire damage.

324
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:44,118
TRAVIS: What is it?

325
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:47,214
MATT: 67 and 66, yeah.

326
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,002
TRAVIS: And I take half of that as well.

327
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,068
LIAM: And evasion evades all of that?

328
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,315
MATT: Correct.

329
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:57,116
LAURA: Can I do an uncanny dodge for any of that?
That's just for melee attacks?

330
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,707
MATT: Uncanny dodge is for a melee attack.

331
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:03,526
TRAVIS: I'll get the calculator out, because my
brain is not working.

332
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,886
ASHLEY: Wait, what kind of damage was this?

333
00:27:05,886 --> 00:27:08,423
MATT: Bludgeoning and fire.

334
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:10,951
ASHLEY: I have resistance to bludgeoning.

335
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:12,857
LAURA: You have resistance to fire, too.

336
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:17,232
MATT: We'll say 66 points of damage is what you
take.

337
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,430
ASHLEY: Okay.

338
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:25,948
MATT: Also, Pike and anybody with a concentration
spell, I need you to make a concentration check.

339
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,211
LIAM: Do I, with the evasion?

340
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,464
MATT: You do not, because you did not take any
damage.

341
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:38,063
SAM: It's a plus what now? Charisma?

342
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:40,111
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

343
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,013
LAURA: So you get advantage on that saving throw.

344
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:45,812
TRAVIS: I remember three meteors last time, not
four.

345
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:47,796
SAM: I mean, there's no way we can beat the amount
of damage he did.

346
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,236
ASHLEY: 22.

347
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:54,886
MATT: With half the damage? No. So Holy Aura fades.

348
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:59,298
TRAVIS: Holy Aura fades.

349
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:00,911
MARISHA: Are you serious?

350
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:01,989
SAM: 27.

351
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:04,981
MATT: 27? You maintain concentration. Wait, no,
because half the damage would be 33. You do not.

352
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,074
There's too much damage, no, you're right.

353
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:10,514
SAM: The whip falls to the floor.

354
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:14,885
MATT: Wait, you took 30-- I'm sorry, you took half
damage from everything. No, it's still 66. So you

355
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:17,350
guys do drop your spells, unfortunately.

356
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,897
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Literally, oh my shitty, undead
god.

357
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:26,251
TALIESIN: This a lot. I'm having a hard time
figuring out this damage.

358
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,630
MATT: That's okay. Figure out the math here,
because it sunders the tower.

359
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,779
TRAVIS: It what?!

360
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:30,986
SAM: What does that mean?

361
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:36,110
TRAVIS: It fucking ignites and explodes the tower.
Sunders is not a good word.

362
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,992
LAURA: So if we can't fly--

363
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:41,190
SAM: It sunders the tower?

364
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,103
LIAM: Break. To split asunder.

365
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:48,099
MATT: If I could get somebody to take this off here
for me?

366
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,510
SAM: But that map was so pretty.

367
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,169
LAURA: You're splitting the party!

368
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:57,092
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

369
00:28:57,092 --> 00:29:01,555
SAM: How did you make that? How did you build that
thing?

370
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,338
LAURA: This is crazy!

371
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,887
TALIESIN: This is not cool, dude.

372
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,540
LIAM: Worst Carvel cake ever!

373
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,565
MARISHA: Yeah. He ordered these. They are cake
stands and I was like, oh are these for our

374
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,829
wedding cake? And he was like--

375
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,311
SAM: No.

376
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:17,507
TRAVIS: You cracked the tower! What is the matter
with you?!

377
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,966
MARISHA: Cake of fucking death.

378
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,770
TRAVIS: I'm at a loss for what we're looking at
right now.

379
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,151
LAURA: Matt, this is so cool, but terrible.

380
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:28,198
TALIESIN: I'm at precisely 70 points.

381
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:29,913
MARISHA: I can't believe this.

382
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:39,398
MATT: All right. So using the photo replication of
this.

383
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:42,504
MARISHA: Is it floating, like a gravitational
state?

384
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:46,325
MATT: I also need everyone to make a strength
saving throw, please.

385
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:51,282
SAM: Saving throw at advantage.

386
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:52,688
LAURA: Not anymore.

387
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:53,931
SAM: What, why?

388
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:57,273
LAURA: Because she lost Holy Aura, because he
fucking did all the damage.

389
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,359
MATT: Sorry, it's in the wrong direction.

390
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,169
TRAVIS: That's all right, take your time.

391
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,773
LIAM: If I'm airborne, do I make the same strength
saving throw?

392
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:09,575
MATT: No. Anyone who's flying doesn't have to
worry about it, necessarily.

393
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:16,201
TALIESIN: Where were you earlier, fucker?

394
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:20,125
TRAVIS: Let us know if we can help.

395
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:25,536
ASHLEY: Oh wait, did you say anyone who's flying
doesn't have to--

396
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,580
MATT: Doesn't have to make the strength saving
throw.

397
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,860
TRAVIS: You should be okay. Because of your
dope-ass Sarenrae wings or whatever.

398
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,993
MATT: So as that detonates and sends it this way,
that puts us--

399
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:39,197
SAM: So Holy Aura's gone?

400
00:30:39,197 --> 00:30:40,938
LAURA: Yep. That fast.

401
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,054
SAM: That was fun.

402
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,801
ASHLEY: That's cool.

403
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,516
SAM: It saved us a bunch of points of damage,
though.

404
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:49,692
LAURA: Was he knocked prone?

405
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:52,153
MATT: No, he's immune to prone.

406
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:53,460
LAURA: Of course he is.

407
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,726
TRAVIS: He's immune to prone?

408
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,456
SAM: How does he make love?

409
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:01,613
(laughter)

410
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,536
TRAVIS: You went there, that fast.

411
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:06,001
LIAM: He's so happy though, now that his hand is
back. Let me tell you.

412
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:11,701
LAURA: It's only up against a wall, for Vecna.

413
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:18,389
MATT: You guys all got slammed and scattered
across this tower, from the explosion. Where he is

414
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:24,788
now, currently. Uses his movement to shift over
here and move up.

415
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:26,645
TRAVIS: Best laid plans, huh?

416
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:30,847
TALIESIN: No plan survives contact with the enemy.
That's the truth.

417
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,176
SAM: Wait, can your thing still--

418
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:37,869
MARISHA: It should still be able to work, yeah,
theoretically.

419
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,457
LAURA: Theoretically.

420
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:50,933
LIAM: You sick bastard, Matt, I love you so much.
Slash hate you.

421
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:55,270
MATT: So after the explosion hits, the ringing in
your ear begins to subside, your vision returns,

422
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,294
and you look about the now-broken tower. You've
grabbed on to what you can, so strength saving

423
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,905
throws for those who weren't flying.

424
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:01,913
TRAVIS: 24.

425
00:32:01,913 --> 00:32:02,849
SAM: 12.

426
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,505
LAURA: 20.

427
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,681
TALIESIN: 27.

428
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:06,880
MARISHA: 19.

429
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,667
TALIESIN: 22, I mean. 22. I'm so sorry.

430
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:14,299
MATT: So everybody but Scanlan makes the save. So
Scanlan, with the detonation, you get thrown off

431
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:19,543
the side of the tower and begin to plummet off the
side.

432
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,983
SAM: Great. Awesome.

433
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:28,315
MATT: So I'll put you right there for the time
being from the impact of it. Moving back, that's

434
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:31,345
going to end Vecna's turn. Grog, you're up first.

435
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:34,038
TRAVIS: I'm up first.

436
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:36,421
SAM: Should I roll initiative for the guy in the
hallway?

437
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,518
MATT: Sure.

438
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,924
SAM: Okay, 16.

439
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,277
MARISHA: Yeah, the whip is down.

440
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:46,018
TALIESIN: You should've sent the guy in the
hallway in first, maybe.

441
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:50,817
MARISHA: I love that from his perspective, you
were like, "If the whip hits the floor, come after us."

442
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:53,460
(footsteps) (yelling) (crashing)

443
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,225
MATT: Also, did you roll 4d6 damage?

444
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,645
LAURA: Yes I did.

445
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,533
MATT: How much was it?

446
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,557
LAURA: 12.

447
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:06,490
MATT: 12 points of radiant damage to him. The
flash hits, he floats up, and now you can see he

448
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,957
chuckles, looking down at the destruction. The
green tendrils of energy, the vein-like

449
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:15,703
projections that have been clutching the tower
together, are now extending out like tethers,

450
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:20,122
grasping the bottom of each floating island that
used to be the top of Entropis as they slowly

451
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:24,575
shift, held in place, and rotate around, the storm
still cycling around you.

452
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,918
LAURA: That's so crazy! They're like floating
things?

453
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:31,342
MATT: Yeah, they're floating, now held in place by
these green tethers, and they're slowly shifting.

454
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,652
Grog, you're up.

455
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:39,118
TRAVIS: Hasted, can I attempt to leap from this
island to the one that Vax is currently on?

456
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,840
MATT: Yeah, make an athletics check.

457
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,228
TRAVIS: Okay.

458
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,949
MARISHA: So it looks like those electro-touchy
balls? What are those called?

459
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:48,069
TRAVIS: 28.

460
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:53,035
MATT: 28? Yeah, easy. You leap over, it would be
20 feet of movement.

461
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:59,041
TRAVIS: Can I move to this corner?

462
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,317
MATT: Okay.

463
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:12,671
TRAVIS: Can I attach the chain of returning to the
Sword of Kas, and throw it up to Vecna? Reckless.

464
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:14,431
MATT: Sure, go for it.

465
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:15,676
LAURA: Reckless?

466
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,065
TRAVIS: Like it matters.

467
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:19,494
SAM: Everything is reckless at this point.

468
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:20,961
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

469
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,740
LAURA: We all rage.

470
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,970
TRAVIS: 31 to hit.

471
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,670
MATT: 31 hits. So as you're getting the chain, as
you leap over and go running across the platforms,

472
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:36,658
you can see the entire platform is lilted to one
side and some stones are tumbling and skidding off

473
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,490
the side. You can see bits of the stone are
charred from the immediate destruction and impact

474
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,922
of the meteors. And as you pull the chain out, as
you rush and attach it, the voice pulses through

475
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:52,073
your head. "Yes! He's here. Right there. Kill him!
Take him down! Deliver me!"

476
00:34:52,073 --> 00:35:03,895
TRAVIS: Can't wait. Okay. Calm down. 22. This is
undead?

477
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,146
MATT: Yes.

478
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:16,412
TRAVIS: Just checking. Ten, 32, 33. Plus enlarge.
Plus four, so 37 necrotic damage.

479
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:17,627
MATT: Necrotic?

480
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:24,975
TRAVIS: Well no, I'm sorry. Not necrotic. Just 37
regular slashing damage.

481
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:30,487
MATT: All right, so 37 points of slashing damage. All
right. With that you toss the blade up into the

482
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:42,031
side. "Oh." And you see for a second, there's a
brief flash of recognition and a slight sliver of

483
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:48,370
worry on his brow for but an instant, before his
hand reaches up and grabs towards to try and pull

484
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,660
the blade out.

485
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,224
TRAVIS: I pull the chain back, catch it with my
hasted action, throw it again. Reckless.

486
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,884
MATT: Okay so you pull it back and make your
attack.

487
00:35:57,884 --> 00:36:03,326
TRAVIS: That's 27.

488
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:04,908
MATT: 27? That hits.

489
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:22,120
TRAVIS: 20. That's a nine so 34 plus one. 35
points of slashing damage.

490
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,073
MATT: 35 points of slashing damage. As you draw
the blade back for the second swing and you rotate

491
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:32,366
it as it goes, "I can taste him," and you fling it
upward and it pierces once more into the abdomen.

492
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:38,377
Each time, you begin to grow more and more nervous
with the proximity of the blade towards the

493
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:43,507
currently unconscious and contained little girl
inside the chest.

494
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:45,388
TRAVIS: I do?

495
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:50,829
MATT: Others may. You may be fine. But it's
passing within like a foot of her each time.

496
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,001
TRAVIS: Where is she in relation to him?

497
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,296
MATT: Inside the chest cavity.

498
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,685
TRAVIS: Right. Got to keep that in mind.

499
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:04,550
MATT: Second time as it hits, there's another
flash of dark energy. Are you withdrawing it?

500
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,527
TRAVIS: Yes.

501
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,690
MATT: Okay. Make another check to pull it out.

502
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,289
SAM: Is she like in his chest cavity?

503
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,659
MATT: Yeah, contained in it.

504
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:11,917
TRAVIS: That's a natural 19. That'll do it.

505
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:14,044
MATT: Yeah, You pull it back. Is that your turn?

506
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,978
TRAVIS: I'm frenzied so I have another attack.

507
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,080
MATT: You do.

508
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,845
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless. Last one.

509
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:23,789
MATT: Hold on. No, I'm sorry. Because you used--

510
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:27,403
TRAVIS: Attack was to throw one, but I only get
the one because I can't do attack-attack.

511
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:28,521
MATT: Correct.

512
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:33,012
TRAVIS: And then the hasted is another action and
then the bonus is to make another attack, but only

513
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:34,101
a single.

514
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:34,959
MATT: Sure.

515
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,007
TRAVIS: Does that work?

516
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:36,992
MATT: Yeah.

517
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:39,874
TRAVIS: So it's a 30 flat. No?

518
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:43,983
MATT: I'm thinking for this, because it's not like
the hammer you throw up, returns every single

519
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,109
time. It's like

520
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:46,825
you impact and then you have to pull it back each
time.

521
00:37:46,825 --> 00:37:49,213
TRAVIS: It takes more than an attack action.

522
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:53,346
MATT: Yeah, so I'd say you attack, then you used
your hasted action to pull it back and let's say

523
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:59,062
you-- bonus action threw it in. So it's actually
still in him. So it's currently embedded in him

524
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:05,499
with the chain now taut at the maximum length.
He's now 30 feet above you. 35 technically, but

525
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,548
you're in large mode.

526
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:10,877
TRAVIS: I have some speed left. Can I run and jump
across? I want to land over here.

527
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:12,556
MATT: Make an athletics check.

528
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,319
SAM: I know you do, but do we as players care
about this girl?

529
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:22,192
TRAVIS: 19.

530
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:25,226
MATT: 19? Yeah. That'll work.

531
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:26,822
LAURA: Yeah, you do you.

532
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:29,428
TRAVIS: I don't know. Up here man, shit's floating
in the fucking air--

533
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:36,525
MATT: As you run and leap and bound, you manage to
catch the edge. Let me check real fast.

534
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,441
LIAM: I mean I did just kill your daughter.

535
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,017
LAURA: It's true. So it is up to you.

536
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:44,257
LIAM: She was brought back, but I did kill her.

537
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:45,889
SAM: Yeah.

538
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:49,006
MARISHA: Casualties of war.

539
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,707
MATT: Actually, a number of feet up to your
strength score. If you move at least ten feet on

540
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,017
foot, so--

541
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:56,250
TRAVIS: Feet up to my strength score?

542
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,015
MATT: Yeah. So you don't have to roll for that.
You can move 26 feet with a jump, as long as you get

543
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:06,215
ten feet of run-up because of your speed. So yeah, you
leap across without issue. The chain is taut as

544
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:10,045
you Tarzan-swing across the way and land on the
other side, still holding on to it.

545
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,012
TRAVIS: How did that feel?

546
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:19,654
MATT: "Delicious." He's talking to you from a
distance. At the end your turn, Vecna's going to

547
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,055
use two legendary actions--

548
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,081
LAURA and TRAVIS: Two legendary actions?!

549
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:32,088
MATT: Yes, to cast a spell. As a reaction, as you
glance past. "Oh no, we cannot let that stay near."

550
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:45,122
And as he pulls out and opens his hands, I need
you to go ahead, Grog, and make a-- Actually, you

551
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:54,452
don't make a saving throw. Grog vanishes from the
battlefield. Gone. You watch as this space closes

552
00:39:54,452 --> 00:40:04,440
around it. Grog. You suddenly appear in a darkened
tunnel of some kind. You look around and you can

553
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,596
see hard walls to each point and ahead of you, it
splits in two different directions. Behind you,

554
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:08,881
it splits into three different directions.

555
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:14,309
TRAVIS: I'm back in the chest of the titan? Does
it look familiar? Do I remember?

556
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,083
MATT: It looks completely unfamiliar.

557
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,519
TRAVIS: It splits in two behind me--

558
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,215
MATT: Two ahead of you and then three behind you.

559
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:21,771
MARISHA: Are you in the Maze of the Abyss?

560
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:22,852
TRAVIS: Do I recognize it?

561
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,042
MATT: No, you've never seen this place before in
your life.

562
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,299
MARISHA: You're in the Endless Maze of the Abyss.
You got to be.

563
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,232
LAURA: I don't know what that is.

564
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,233
TRAVIS: It's not my turn anymore.

565
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,190
MATT: Nope. That's the end of Grog's turn. Vex,
you're up.

566
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,848
MARISHA: It's another plane.

567
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:40,271
TRAVIS: I completely forgot that happened last
time. Of all the tactical things I watched.

568
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,702
LAURA: It wasn't him that did it. It was the other
guy. It was the death knight that did it to you

569
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:43,697
last time.

570
00:40:43,697 --> 00:40:47,751
TRAVIS: That's right. It was the death knight. How
did we fix that last time?

571
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:51,765
LAURA: I'm going to look over at Percy and grab
his hand for a second.

572
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:53,915
MATT: Do enough damage to make him drop
concentration. That's what you did last time to

573
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,219
bring him back.

574
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,308
TALIESIN: I regret nothing.

575
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:58,796
LAURA: Nothing at all. Hunter's Mark!

576
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:02,064
MATT: Hunter's Mark Vecna. All right. Bonus
action.

577
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:05,097
LAURA: Yeah, get ready Vecna--

578
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:06,708
LIAM: 1d6, bitch!

579
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,094
MATT: Oh god.

580
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:09,235
LIAM: He's dead.

581
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:10,334
MATT: That's not helping.

582
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,936
TALIESIN: He's wearing it like a bangle from the
80s.

583
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:15,493
TRAVIS: I like how he's surrounded by swirls of
Aquafresh.

584
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:22,601
LAURA: And I'm going to run over to where Grog had
been-ish--

585
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:24,103
TRAVIS: And mourn?

586
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:30,883
LAURA: Cry over you? Not quite that far. I'm
staying against the wall. Yeah, that's better. Not

587
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:38,498
that it matters very much. Then I'm going to shoot
him with my holy damage/needle arrow.

588
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:41,063
MATT: Go for it. Roll for the attack.

589
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:46,831
LAURA: Okay, that is a 30.

590
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:48,633
MATT: 30? That hits.

591
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:51,956
LAURA: Great. Can I make it a bramble shot?

592
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:53,128
MATT: Sure.

593
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:59,159
SAM: I'm falling, right?

594
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:05,427
MATT: You are. You got lobbed off the side from the
explosion and the tower crumbling beneath you. You

595
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:08,462
couldn't find purchase. You grabbed part of the
stone and your fingers slid and scraped off.

596
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:14,718
MARISHA: You got something for that, right?

597
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:19,025
SAM: Yeah, but gets me out of commission for a
round.

598
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:23,367
TALIESIN: We've got to figure out how to get Grog
back.

599
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:28,043
LAURA: 41 damage. And he has to make a strength
saving throw.

600
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,013
TRAVIS: That breaks concentration, right?

601
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,939
LAURA: Well yeah, but--

602
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:34,780
MATT: That is--

603
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,305
TRAVIS: What? Don't look at that. What was it?

604
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:42,962
MATT: Okay. He's going to burn a legendary
resistance. He does not want to be restrained

605
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:44,531
right now.

606
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:46,419
TRAVIS: He has used two legendary actions and a
resistance, right?

607
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:49,882
MARISHA: Yeah, but I think he gets two or three 
legendary actions per turn.

608
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:57,167
MATT: So he burns off that. So that was a total of
41 damage. So half that.

609
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:00,227
LAURA: Oh wait! Oh, never mind. Yes, 41 damage.

610
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:08,361
MATT: So he's going to make a concentration check.
Yeah, he succeeds. That's 22.

611
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,096
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to hit him again.

612
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:11,646
MATT: He had to roll a 20.

613
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:13,495
LAURA: I'm going to hit him again with another
needle arrow.

614
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:15,792
TRAVIS: Don't be afraid of rolling ones, man.

615
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:21,415
LAURA: What was that before I hit it?

616
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:23,272
TRAVIS: 11. Did it move?

617
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:27,475
LAURA: I don't what it was before I hit it with
this dice.

618
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:29,002
LIAM and TRAVIS: Reroll.

619
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:32,075
LAURA: Sorry. Actually, I think that was probably
it.

620
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:36,614
TRAVIS: It was lower. Since we're being honest.

621
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,761
LAURA: 25.

622
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:44,717
LIAM: Is this your #blessed?

623
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:46,619
MATT: 25 piercing damage.

624
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,777
LAURA: No, that's a 25 to hit.

625
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:50,530
MATT: Oh, 25 to hit? I'm sorry, yes, that hits.

626
00:43:50,530 --> 00:44:05,702
LAURA: Okay. That's good. 25 hits. 19. That's it?
I don't get any sneak attack? Nothing?

627
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:07,935
MATT: 19 points of damage?

628
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:10,619
LAURA: 19 points. Does he get any holy damage from
those arrows?

629
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:18,799
MATT: No. What it does is it bypasses or can hit
creatures that normally are immune to non-magical

630
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:23,254
weapons like those ghosts and things, so it
doesn't have an additional effect that you can see

631
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:24,583
from it, unfortunately.

632
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:25,767
LAURA: Oh, all right.

633
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,083
MATT: So how much damage was it?

634
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,242
LAURA: 19.

635
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,079
LIAM: Hey now, this is our first god we're
fighting.

636
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,577
MATT: Okay, yeah. He does make his save still. So
as the two arrows swish past and slam into part of

637
00:44:35,577 --> 00:44:41,053
his neck, it seems to pass through, a period
where it's just energy. A second one whisks through

638
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,958
the bottom of his body--

639
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:45,610
LAURA: Plus another one point of damage.

640
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:52,117
MATT: All right. 20. And he glances down at you,
the eye flashes, "Oh don't worry, I'm coming for

641
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:55,893
"you soon enough." That end your turn?

642
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,462
LAURA: Yes. I forgot.

643
00:44:57,462 --> 00:45:04,166
MATT: (laughter) That's amazing.

644
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,355
SAM: I'm inspired.

645
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:09,266
TALIESIN: I feel a little better.

646
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:17,509
MATT: You've taken enough care through aiming to
not strike anywhere near who you recognize within.

647
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,601
LAURA: Yes.

648
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:30,913
TRAVIS: What size would you say Vecna is?

649
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:37,997
MATT: He would be considered gargantuan. Why?

650
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:39,953
TRAVIS: Oh, I can't grapple him.

651
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:45,489
MATT: Well, you have the powerful build. So you're
considered large, and you can grapple one size larger than that.

652
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:52,987
LAURA: Trinket is going to look around, really
confused, and scooch a couple of squares

653
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:54,602
closer to Pike.

654
00:45:54,602 --> 00:45:57,036
MATT: Okay, perfect. That ends your turn?

655
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,025
LAURA: Yeah.

656
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:13,027
MATT: Vecna, end of your turn, is going to use a
third legendary action to use a Firebolt against--

657
00:46:13,027 --> 00:46:19,651
let's say against you, since you just shot him.

658
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,145
LAURA: Great, cool!

659
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:29,484
MATT: So spell attack. That is a 35.

660
00:46:29,484 --> 00:46:30,747
LAURA: To hit?

661
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:31,572
MATT: To hit, yeah.

662
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:32,885
LAURA: I guess, yeah.

663
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:35,951
MARISHA: Did he do a Flame Strike?

664
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:39,722
MATT: It's 4d10. Nope, it's a Firebolt, a
cantrip.

665
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:42,190
TRAVIS: (laughter) It's a cantrip?

666
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:48,294
MATT: 21 points of fire damage to you. As the bolt
slams into you.

667
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:53,676
LAURA: Great. He takes 4d6 radiant damage again,
from hitting me.

668
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:54,988
MATT: Go for it.

669
00:46:54,988 --> 00:46:59,919
LAURA: Nine points of radiant damage.

670
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:04,470
MATT: Rolls for concentration. Natural one.

671
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,926
LAURA: Oh my God! That means we get Grog back!

672
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:10,925
MATT: He's going to go ahead and use his legendary
resistance to maintain it.

673
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,441
LAURA: Can he do that?

674
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:17,810
TRAVIS: My despair is growing by the second with
those words that you just uttered.

675
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,897
LAURA: How many legendary resistances does he
get?

676
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:23,994
SAM: Probably five.

677
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:26,937
LAURA: He has as many as he wants. He resists
everything.

678
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:30,841
MATT: That's going to finish your turn, I
believe?

679
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:32,306
TRAVIS: That's a weird feeling.

680
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:33,776
MATT: I'm sorry.

681
00:47:33,776 --> 00:47:37,104
LAURA: We have to keep hitting him and try to
break his concentration.

682
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,290
MATT: All right, Vax, you're up next.

683
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:50,166
LIAM: Click the boots. What I'd like to do is fly
within ten feet of him. To do that, how far am I

684
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:54,791
flying? I have 120 feet of movement, wings out,
hasted.

685
00:47:54,791 --> 00:48:02,068
MATT: Correct. From that distance, about 45 feet.

686
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:09,301
LIAM: Spending 45 feet to get there? Once I'm in
ten feet, as a bonus action I cast Vow of Enmity

687
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:23,637
on him. To start. I have no idea if I'm in range?
It doesn't seem like I'm in range, but I don't

688
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:29,201
know. But that's within ten feet of him?

689
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:31,032
MATT: Yeah, about ten feet.

690
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:38,588
LIAM: Just in case, I'm going to use my hasted
action to disengage and fly away from him-- no!

691
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:50,135
I'm going to use my regular action to attack twice
as a paladin. At advantage, first one (groans),

692
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,600
I'm going to use--

693
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,900
LAURA: Plus four!

694
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,320
LIAM: Right, plus four. Hold on, where did my four
go? Someone give me a four! I don't know where my

695
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,534
own four went.

696
00:49:01,534 --> 00:49:02,660
MARISHA: Take it!

697
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,713
LAURA: Oh, I was going to hand him the same one!

698
00:49:04,713 --> 00:49:12,908
MARISHA: (laughs) Take the dark purple, moody one!
Or I should have given you a different one.

699
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:20,080
LIAM: It's going to be plus one. I already did
that. It's going to be a 24 on that, to hit.

700
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,361
MATT: 24 hits.

701
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:22,349
LIAM: Hits!

702
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:23,263
MATT: Yes.

703
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:35,869
LIAM: I'll roll for the second attack as well.
Which is a 25. The first one is Whisper and it

704
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:53,141
does (counting). Oh, shit! I wanted to throw it at
the tome. Does that change anything?

705
00:49:53,141 --> 00:50:01,715
MATT: That would be a different roll. Then we'd
have to roll again.

706
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:20,878
LIAM: Never mind. 19. Can I reroll the second
attack? Nah! Forget it. (counting) 44 for the

707
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:22,104
first attack.

708
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:31,921
MATT: Okay. 44 points of damage. Natural 18. He
makes his concentration check.

709
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:43,502
LIAM: Okay, and the second attack is nine. And I
will dump poison into it, which is stupid, but I'm

710
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:47,663
going to do it anyway! He's the only one here. He
has to make a DC 15. Come on, big guy!

711
00:50:47,663 --> 00:50:49,304
MATT: He's immune to poison.

712
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:55,734
LIAM: After my two paladin attacks I'm going to--

713
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,911
MATT: Sorry, how many points?

714
00:50:57,911 --> 00:51:04,260
LIAM: Nine. Then I'll use my hasted action to
disengage just in case he can curb stomp me and I

715
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:16,354
want to fly to here and hover ten feet above that
chunk of cake. Just remember I'm floating.

716
00:51:16,354 --> 00:51:22,026
MATT: That ends your turn?

717
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:29,330
TRAVIS: He has cardiac arrest and dies.

718
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,038
MATT: He's going to continue on.

719
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:33,932
MARISHA: Oh, that heart disease! It's the number
one killer!

720
00:51:33,932 --> 00:51:37,285
MATT: Now we're on the initiative count 20.

721
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:39,192
TRAVIS: <i>Now</i> we're at 20.

722
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:47,694
MATT: Yes. The dead rise. Bits of scattered bone
and corpses that litter the top of this tower,

723
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:51,157
many of which have been thrust off in the
explosion and charred and destroyed from the

724
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:53,998
impact, others begin to clack together and rise.

725
00:51:53,998 --> 00:51:57,842
SAM: Oh my God.

726
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:03,132
MARISHA: We're not afraid of this!

727
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:09,853
MATT: Nine skeletons rise from the ground.

728
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:16,967
MARISHA: Nine?

729
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,959
MATT: Nine of them.

730
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,578
SAM: Nine times!

731
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:24,860
LAURA: Get your skeleton ass away from me!

732
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,261
SAM: That will do it.

733
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:34,627
LIAM: Can we hit the table like we're tilting a
pinball machine, and knock him off?

734
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:46,087
MATT: All righty, so those two take an attack
against you, Vex. That is 18.

735
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:48,551
LAURA: To hit? Doesn't hit me!

736
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:56,762
MATT: Now against Percival, it's a natural 20. You
take ten points of slashing damage, as the

737
00:52:56,762 --> 00:53:05,724
skeleton pulls this rusted scimitar to the side and
rakes it across your chest. Then against Keyleth,

738
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:14,991
a natural three is not going to hit. Against Pike,
an 18 is not going to hit. Against you, Vax, that

739
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,882
doesn't hit. I think that's it.

740
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:21,174
LAURA: Does your armor, Pike, do anything against
people that are attacking you with melee?

741
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:22,603
MATT: They'd have to hit though.

742
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,957
ASHLEY: Yeah.

743
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:30,713
MATT: That is going to finish the lair action.
Scanlan Two is up.

744
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:34,259
SAM: He's going to, if there's a path up--

745
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:40,757
MATT: He is currently clutching on the side of
this. So he didn't have to worry about watching

746
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:43,498
the whip drop. It's the rest of the tower.

747
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:48,574
SAM: Is he in a place where he can climb, or no?

748
00:53:48,574 --> 00:53:50,603
MATT: Make a general athletics check for him.

749
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:56,330
SAM: Seven? Plus four. 11.

750
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:02,298
MATT: 11. Does he want to try and inspire himself?
It's an ability check.

751
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:16,241
SAM: Shit. I want to do so much other than try to
hang onto the floor at this point. Shit. I guess

752
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:20,786
he'll inspire himself.

753
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:24,882
MATT: Okay. Roll a d12 and add to it.

754
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:30,229
SAM: Wait, roll and add two?

755
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,922
MATT: No, add the roll to it.

756
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:33,793
SAM: Oh, well that just makes it 14.

757
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:39,463
MATT: 14 is just enough. It's not super hard to
climb this, you get just to the edge there.

758
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:41,078
LAURA: You're little and light.

759
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:42,231
SAM: Hi.

760
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:43,845
LAURA: Hey Scanlan Two.

761
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:46,999
SAM: Where is my friend, Scanlan One?

762
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:53,274
TALIESIN: That's all the conversation we can have
in one action. No time to respond to that.

763
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:56,236
SAM: Great. In that case--

764
00:54:56,236 --> 00:54:57,736
MATT: And that's all your movement for him.

765
00:54:57,736 --> 00:55:00,471
SAM: Sure, great, yeah, of course it is. And his
bonus action.

766
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:03,259
MATT: Did he use his bonus action?

767
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,518
SAM: Inspire.

768
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:08,607
MATT: Well it's not inspiring. It's giving
yourself the use of an ability check.

769
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:10,948
SAM: You tell me, friend.

770
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:14,458
LAURA: My face is so red!

771
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,827
MARISHA: I'm sure I'm flushed.

772
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:19,119
TRAVIS: Pretty sure we're playing this outdoors in
Miami right now.

773
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,322
MATT: It does not cost you a bonus action. Your
peerless skill does not.

774
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,588
SAM: But it does cost me an inspiration.

775
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:28,429
MATT: Correct, for Scanlan Two because he has his own
pool.

776
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:31,776
SAM: Shit. There's barely anything I can do.

777
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:33,693
LAURA: Scanlan, you can do so much!

778
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:37,989
SAM: Yeah, I can do so much. I don't see anything
that's going on. I'm going to make an attack on

779
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:50,748
the guy, because that's all I know how to do. On
the big man. The god. I'll do-- shit, I can't do

780
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:54,064
that. I'll do a Lightning Bolt at level five.

781
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:55,421
MATT: Okay.

782
00:55:55,421 --> 00:55:59,672
LAURA and MARISHA: He's immune to lightning.

783
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:03,905
SAM: I don't know that. Do I know that? Would I
know that?

784
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:06,284
LAURA: You would know what Scanlan knows, and he
did know that.

785
00:56:06,284 --> 00:56:10,008
MATT: He was resistant to lightning damage last
time.

786
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:11,867
SAM: So Scanlan Two would know this.

787
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:13,075
MATT: Technically.

788
00:56:13,075 --> 00:56:17,184
SAM: Well in that case, I will do a Fireball.

789
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:19,507
MATT: Level five Fireball?

790
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:26,240
SAM: Yes, it's using five charges from the
Fireball. Oh! No, can't do that. Doesn't have the

791
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,777
wand. Never mind! Then in that case, he's going to
do Bigby's Hand!

792
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:32,998
MATT: Okay. Where does Bigby's Hand appear?

793
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:39,224
SAM: Right under his chin, and it's going to punch
him.

794
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:45,315
LAURA: Your wand gives a plus one to spell attacks
and shit.

795
00:56:45,315 --> 00:56:57,384
SAM: Oh, he has a wand! Okay. 17 plus 11. 28.

796
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:59,187
MATT: 28 hits. Roll damage.

797
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:03,687
SAM: Bigby's Hand. Shit. It's 4d6?

798
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:08,499
MATT: 4d8, and you cast it at 5th-level?

799
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:18,218
SAM: Yeah. They're all bad. 12 points.

800
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:22,686
MATT: No damage, actually. Bigby's Hand slams
towards him and impacts to no effect.

801
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:28,199
LAURA: Does it not count as magical? Or is he
resistant to bludgeoning?

802
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:35,907
MATT: You get the sense that only a certain level
of magic can break past his magical barrier.

803
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:39,520
SAM: Oh shit.

804
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,364
TRAVIS: I just swallowed my gum.

805
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:48,663
MATT: You watch as Bigby's Hand slams into him to
no effect and pulls back, and you're like, "That's

806
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:50,633
"not good." Make an intelligence check.

807
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:54,323
SAM: One.

808
00:57:54,323 --> 00:57:56,368
MATT: That sucks!

809
00:57:56,368 --> 00:58:04,718
SAM: Oh no. Oh wow. Okay.

810
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:08,070
TRAVIS: We are getting an education here in the
first round.

811
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:15,518
SAM: Okay, bonus action. Who am I near? Am I near
Keyleth? Can I inspire Keyleth? Is she close

812
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:16,541
enough to me?

813
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:17,736
MATT: You can do that.

814
00:58:17,736 --> 00:58:28,064
SAM: I will inspire Keyleth. I will sing:
(singing) 25,677 minutes. Ask Critical Role Stats

815
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:41,153
if you don't believe me. 25,677 minutes. That's
how long we've been playing. Playing this game.

816
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:45,000
TRAVIS: (singing) Talk about fucked!

817
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,950
MATT: All right, so take your d12 inspiration die.
Is that the end of Scanlan Two's turn?

818
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,120
SAM: Yes, it is.

819
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:55,111
MATT: All right, at the end of his turn, Vecna's
going to use his last two legendary actions.

820
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:58,211
TRAVIS: His last two?

821
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,294
MATT: Yeah.

822
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:00,947
TRAVIS: So he has five.

823
00:59:00,947 --> 00:59:06,714
MATT: To cast another spell. As he sees Scanlan One go 
flying down off the edge and Scanlan Two climb up, he

824
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:14,979
glances down and goes, "You clever little gnome."
He's going to attempt to dispel.

825
00:59:14,979 --> 00:59:21,083
SAM: I am going to reaction Counterspell at
8th-level.

826
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,236
MATT: At 8th-level?

827
00:59:22,236 --> 00:59:23,490
SAM: Yes.

828
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:31,416
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll. Oh, at 8th-level,
it means that it nullifies the spell. He was

829
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:32,901
dispelling at 6th-level.

830
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,216
LAURA: Yay!

831
00:59:34,216 --> 00:59:35,676
LIAM: Fuck you, Vecna!

832
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:46,792
SAM: Scanlan will say: Ooh! Look what you made
me do. You made me screw up you. You made me screw

833
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,647
up you and now you have to do brand new.

834
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:55,835
(laughter)

835
00:59:55,835 --> 01:00:04,352
MATT: You watch the Undying King in his
magnificent, horrible form lean forward, going,

836
01:00:04,352 --> 01:00:10,285
"What? Ugh." Prepares for whatever he has coming
up next.

837
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:12,218
SAM: I'm sure it's going to be not good.

838
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:15,216
MATT: That's the end of that. Keyleth, you're up.

839
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:22,694
MARISHA: Okay. Thank god. I think Grog is by Vex,
yeah? I'm going to cast my 6th-level Bones of the Earth.

840
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:26,096
MATT: Where do you want to place it? How many does
it create?

841
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:34,160
MARISHA: It creates six at 120 feet distance. Five
feet wide, 30 feet high. So I'm going to see where

842
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,156
Grog is--

843
01:00:35,156 --> 01:00:37,143
MATT: Well, Grog is not on the field. You don't
see Grog anywhere.

844
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:42,098
MARISHA: Oh, shit! That's right. Is this useless
for me to do right now?

845
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:43,289
SAM: Yes!

846
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:46,636
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're all ranged except for--

847
01:00:46,636 --> 01:00:48,324
SAM: Get that fucking god.

848
01:00:48,324 --> 01:01:00,166
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to scratch that. I'm
going to scrap that right now. I am going to do an

849
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:07,080
8th-level Sunburst right in his face. 12d6.

850
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,229
SAM: That's a powerful spell.

851
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:13,365
TRAVIS: 12d6? Holy shit.

852
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:16,106
MATT: Okay. So constitution saving throw.

853
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,583
MARISHA: He's probably got a stupid constitution.

854
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,127
MATT: Rolled a natural three.

855
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:21,916
SAM: He'll use that legendary resist.

856
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,509
MATT: No. He's going to take it.

857
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:26,499
LAURA: That's five of them now?

858
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,743
MARISHA: No, he's taking it.

859
01:01:28,743 --> 01:01:30,416
MATT: He's used two legendary resistances.

860
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,371
SAM: Two? I thought it was three? No?

861
01:01:32,371 --> 01:01:33,602
MATT: No, he's used two.

862
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:39,372
MARISHA: He takes 12d6 and he is blinded for a
minute. But he's got True Sight.

863
01:01:39,372 --> 01:01:41,097
MATT: He's immune to blind, unfortunately.

864
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:51,992
MARISHA: Well, he takes 12d6 radiant damage, which
is cool. Come on, big money!

865
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:54,128
TALIESIN: Remember, you can reroll things, right?

866
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,622
SAM: Oh yeah, reroll those ones!

867
01:01:55,622 --> 01:02:19,028
MARISHA: I am again. Okay, so that's six,
(counting). That was almost a six! My finger

868
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:30,501
fucked it up. (counting), 45 points of radiant
damage.

869
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:34,391
SAM: Ooh! He's rolling.

870
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:36,068
MATT: He rolled a four.

871
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:37,980
SAM: (gasps) You're back.

872
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:45,902
MATT: No. He's going to burn his third legendary
resistance to maintain. He tasted that sword. He

873
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:52,299
does not want you on that field. You also notice
as the detonation of radiant energy blasts his

874
01:02:52,299 --> 01:02:57,492
form, "Ugh!" he withdraws a bit and you can see
the energy flicker and dropping from within his

875
01:02:57,492 --> 01:03:06,254
ribcage, you watch as a slightly burned, unmoving
little girl begins to fall out of him.

876
01:03:06,254 --> 01:03:09,624
MARISHA: I really hope I didn't kill another kid.

877
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:12,085
LAURA: Hope you didn't kill our sister.

878
01:03:12,085 --> 01:03:18,377
TRAVIS: People never change, Keyleth.

879
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,088
MARISHA: Fuck you.

880
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:23,884
(laughter)

881
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:25,970
LIAM: She's off the side, yeah?

882
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:28,655
MATT: She's plummeting through this crack.
Straight down.

883
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:32,901
TRAVIS: Hey man, at least you hit him.

884
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:39,965
MARISHA: Man, I was just starting to get over that
first kid. Not that I would ever get over-- I'm

885
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:53,109
going to use my bonus action to cast a Healing
Word at 2nd-level on myself. And then I'm going to

886
01:03:53,109 --> 01:04:00,369
take whatever breath I have left and say: Pike!
Ouch, hurting. I'm hurting.

887
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,264
LAURA: We're all hurting.

888
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:03,427
ASHLEY: I got you, boo.

889
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:08,340
SAM: How did she get hurt that bad? Oh, she took
the full thing.

890
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,148
TALIESIN: She took 100 and-- yeah.

891
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:16,991
MATT: So Keyleth, you're going to stay where you
are?

892
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:25,699
MARISHA: I'm going to move up a bit, near
Trinket.

893
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:28,773
MATT: Around there?

894
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:32,125
MARISHA: Behind Trinket, I want to be close to
Pike still.

895
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:37,446
MATT: Okay. So there you are. That ends your turn?
All right. Percival, you're up.

896
01:04:37,446 --> 01:04:41,704
TALIESIN: All right. The first thing I'm going to
do is deal with this skeleton that's right in

897
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:46,273
front of me because there's-- actually, yeah.
First thing I'm going to do is deal with this

898
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:55,177
skeleton in front of me and take a slash at him
with my sword. So that's-- doesn't matter, does

899
01:04:55,177 --> 01:04:57,090
it? 20 to hit?

900
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,594
MATT: 20 hits, yep.

901
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:06,210
TALIESIN: I'm going to do 1d8 plus I'm actually
going to burn two points of lightning into this

902
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:11,025
too from Cabal's Ruin. So I'll see what one of
that does.

903
01:05:11,025 --> 01:05:15,133
MATT: You're on deck.

904
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:21,090
TALIESIN: That's awful. Eight points of silvered
piercing damage plus seven points of lightning

905
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,043
damage.

906
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:27,322
MATT: Okay. As the skeleton lunges towards you,
you put the barrel of the gun-- Oh, this is the

907
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:32,657
sword! I see. As you do, it cuts right through and
bones go scattering off the side as it's

908
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:33,917
destroyed.

909
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:39,031
TALIESIN: 15 did it. That's fine. Next shot, I'm
taking the shot with the skeleton that's next to Vex.

910
01:05:39,031 --> 01:05:42,646
MATT: Okay. So you (sheathes sword, gunshot).

911
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:50,616
TALIESIN: Yep. And I killed a thing so I get a
grit back. That's 30 to hit?

912
01:05:50,616 --> 01:05:52,527
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

913
01:05:52,527 --> 01:06:03,065
TALIESIN: All right, I have to switch dice. That's
1d10 plus 1d6 psychic. I'll burn another one point

914
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:04,783
of Cabal into that.

915
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:14,772
MATT: For the purposes of this, this is Velora,
plummeting down.

916
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:20,828
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage plus five points of
psychic and one point of lightning.

917
01:06:20,828 --> 01:06:28,622
MATT: As it's scraping at your betrothed, you fire
the gun and watch as the skeleton skull blasts

918
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:31,882
clean off the rest of the body. It scratches one
more time before it clatters into a pile of

919
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:33,235
lifeless bones.

920
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:38,411
TALIESIN: I get another grit back. And now, where
are there other skeletons? Who's getting it?

921
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,429
MATT: There's three over there, one over there and
three over there that are waiting.

922
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:46,458
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a whack at the one
that's right next to Keyleth.

923
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:50,932
SAM: Does he take only magical damage?

924
01:06:50,932 --> 01:06:52,333
TALIESIN: Yeah.

925
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:56,673
MATT: He takes damage from magical weapons.

926
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,438
LAURA: So your weapon is magical, isn't it?

927
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:03,941
TALIESIN: Yeah but I'm not going to do--
technically is my weapon magical?

928
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:04,908
MATT: Animus is.

929
01:07:04,908 --> 01:07:06,197
TALIESIN: Okay. So Animus will do.

930
01:07:06,197 --> 01:07:07,391
LAURA: So you can do damage against him.

931
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,389
TALIESIN: Yeah, but right now I'm better at
clearing than anything. I'm not going to be the

932
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:12,916
one who does damage to him.

933
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:16,673
LAURA: I feel like if you can break his
concentration.

934
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:21,035
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's have a little fun. For my
third shot, I'm going to turn on him. First, I'm

935
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:23,136
going to cast Hex.

936
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:26,099
MATT: Okay. As a bonus action. Hexed.

937
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:30,902
TALIESIN: He is necro, disadvantage on
intelligence because fuck that guy and I'm going

938
01:07:30,902 --> 01:07:38,290
to hit him with Animus. I'm going to drop a point
of grit for advantage.

939
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:42,418
TRAVIS: Just chilling. I'm having trouble staying
awake.

940
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:48,909
TALIESIN: Damn it. Well, that will do. 31 to hit?

941
01:07:48,909 --> 01:07:50,348
MATT: That hits.

942
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:56,040
TALIESIN: And I'm throwing all of Cabal into it.
So that's 1d10, sorry. I'm trying to do this.

943
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,143
1d10.

944
01:07:57,143 --> 01:07:58,504
MATT: Count the lightning damage separately.

945
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:07,263
TALIESIN: Yes, I know. So that's not bad. 15
points of damage plus six points of psychic

946
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:20,996
damage. And let's drop six points of lightning
damage into it. Three, four, five, six. That's not

947
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:27,134
bad. 21 points of lightning damage.

948
01:08:27,134 --> 01:08:35,388
MATT: All right. That's 31 total for that. He's
going to make a concentration check. Natural 18.

949
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:36,762
He's fine.

950
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:44,981
TALIESIN: Actually, there was one more! I'm so
sorry! I forgot to do the necrotic damage on top

951
01:08:44,981 --> 01:08:49,163
of that. So with necrotic damage, that's another
six points of necrotic damage.

952
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:53,792
MATT: You notice both the blasts of lightning and
the dark necrotic energy seem to be partially

953
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,636
wounding but not on the level you'd expect.

954
01:08:56,636 --> 01:09:05,857
TALIESIN: Okay. Still what I expected. I'm going
to burn an action surge.

955
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:07,529
LAURA: Yeah, hit again.

956
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:15,264
TALIESIN: I'm not going to hit him again because I
got no more-- if everything goes well I can do 24

957
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:16,870
points of damage to him.

958
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,319
LAURA: But that might make him break his
concentration.

959
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,599
SAM: It's now or never.

960
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:27,148
MARISHA: We've got to get Grog back. Grog has a
trammel.

961
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:39,152
TALIESIN: I'm going to use sharpshooter. Fuck it,
let's see if that does anything. I'm going to add

962
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:44,790
sharpshooter. I'm going to burn my last grit for
advantage.

963
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:49,438
LAURA: You got this, Percy.

964
01:09:49,438 --> 01:09:58,481
TALIESIN: Let's see if that hits. This is probably
not going to hit, is it? That's a six. That's

965
01:09:58,481 --> 01:10:02,105
okay. Yeah, probably didn't hit. Yeah, this is
really shitty.

966
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:03,929
MARISHA: How can you tell?

967
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:06,000
TALIESIN: I can tell. 17 to hit?

968
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,498
MATT: Nope. Just passes through one of the open
spaces in the ribs.

969
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:17,335
TALIESIN: So I've got two more shots. I'm taking
another shot with no advantage.

970
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:19,489
MATT: Sharpshooter?

971
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:25,612
TALIESIN: Yeah. 19 to hit?

972
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,884
MATT: 19. This one actually hits the armor and
reflects off.

973
01:10:28,884 --> 01:10:30,454
TALIESIN: Last shot.

974
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:32,312
LAURA: You've got this. You got this!

975
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:36,463
TALIESIN: That's better. 24 to hit.

976
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:37,515
MATT: That hits.

977
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:39,302
MARISHA: Just on the cusp.

978
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:47,419
TALIESIN: Just on the cusp. So that's my 1d10 plus
my 1d6 plus my other 1d6. Is that right? Yeah.

979
01:10:47,419 --> 01:11:01,652
That's 15, 22 points of damage plus five points of
psychic damage and two points of necrotic damage.

980
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:06,745
SAM: How do you want to do this?

981
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:08,792
(laughter)

982
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:20,453
MATT: That is a 22. So this final shot hits him
and he barely feels an impact and grins down at

983
01:11:20,453 --> 01:11:26,276
you as a baneful gaze curling across the floor.
He's now aware of your presence.

984
01:11:26,276 --> 01:11:28,678
LAURA: Did he take a concentration?

985
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,185
MATT: He did. He succeeded.

986
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:36,992
TALIESIN: I'm going to break line of sight behind
that wall. Just head up there a little bit. About

987
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,582
there. Yeah. Actually, still against the wall
though.

988
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:46,087
MATT: Okay. So that moves you up to there. That's
your turn? End of Percival's turn, Scanlan. As you

989
01:11:46,087 --> 01:11:52,005
are now off the edge, you can see the edge of the
tower vanishing away from you, the cyclone

990
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:56,569
whirling above. Part of it catches you on the way
out as you hit the edge of the cyclone that's

991
01:11:56,569 --> 01:12:01,476
circulating it. Go ahead and make a dexterity
saving throw at disadvantage because you're

992
01:12:01,476 --> 01:12:04,357
falling.

993
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:06,503
SAM: 19.

994
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:08,972
MATT: 19. Okay. So you take half damage.

995
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:10,593
SAM: Damage?

996
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:12,097
TRAVIS: Cyclone.

997
01:12:12,097 --> 01:12:20,660
MATT: Would've been 16 points of piercing damage
from the shrapnel being spun around it, you

998
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,858
instead take eight.

999
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:23,063
TRAVIS: Eight.

1000
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:24,280
SAM: Okay.

1001
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,906
TRAVIS: Sorry.

1002
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:28,737
LAURA: (laughs) You're just repeating everything
Matt says.

1003
01:12:28,737 --> 01:12:32,636
(laughter)

1004
01:12:32,636 --> 01:12:37,748
SAM: I don't know. I have no good options.
Nothing. Of course I can save myself, but I'm

1005
01:12:37,748 --> 01:12:40,346
trying to do more than just save myself.

1006
01:12:40,346 --> 01:12:41,599
TRAVIS: So noble.

1007
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:45,538
MARISHA: You have to save yourself so you can help
us!

1008
01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:50,123
LIAM: Save yourself now so you can do something in
15 seconds.

1009
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:52,466
LAURA: Or turn into something that attacks?

1010
01:12:52,466 --> 01:12:58,426
SAM: (sighs) I'm going to. (fanfare) I'm going to
inspire myself.

1011
01:12:58,426 --> 01:13:00,747
MATT: As you're falling.

1012
01:13:00,747 --> 01:13:08,269
SAM: Yes. I'll start singing to myself. This is a
stupid idea. I'll inspire myself, I'll sing:

1013
01:13:08,269 --> 01:13:17,536
(singing) I give inspiration, it's just what I do.
Every time they try to knock me down I just get

1014
01:13:17,536 --> 01:13:27,641
bold. I give inspiration, every time I do. Every
time I open up my mouth it comes out gold.

1015
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:32,512
MATT: For what check are you doing that for?

1016
01:13:32,512 --> 01:13:40,775
SAM: Oh no. I'm just giving myself inspiration in
general. You can't do that?! Oh fuck. Well in that

1017
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:43,198
case, forget it. I don't do that at all.

1018
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:49,461
MATT: Yeah. One creature other than yourself. And
you have the ability peerless skill which means

1019
01:13:49,461 --> 01:13:52,740
when you're making an ability check you can add
bardic inspiration to it.

1020
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,193
SAM: Do I see anyone? Or can I inspire anyone from
my distance?

1021
01:13:55,193 --> 01:13:55,984
MATT: No.

1022
01:13:55,984 --> 01:13:57,763
SAM: Well then, forget it, I don't do that. Shit
balls.

1023
01:13:57,763 --> 01:14:03,364
MATT: So in this alternate reality you're
singing under your breath, trying to build your

1024
01:14:03,364 --> 01:14:07,121
resolve as you-- You're up next, Pike, by the way.
Be ready.

1025
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:16,212
SAM: I can't do shit! I will Dimension Door to his
chest.

1026
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:21,121
TALIESIN: What?!

1027
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:24,727
TRAVIS: Oh god, it's on. Here we go.

1028
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:30,198
MATT: With that, there's a burst of purplish
arcane energy as your eyes are trained on the

1029
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:37,502
massive god-like form of Vecna and there in the
vacuous space where Velora once was encased, you

1030
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:44,735
see a familiar gnome's form appear in that pocket.
So you are currently-- we'll put you there, say

1031
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:45,806
you're in the space.

1032
01:14:45,806 --> 01:14:48,762
SAM: Not inside the chest, I would be hanging on
the outside.

1033
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:50,393
MATT: Okay. So you're on the edge of the rib
cage.

1034
01:14:50,393 --> 01:15:00,102
SAM: Yeah. Bonus action. Am I within range of any
of my friends to inspire them?

1035
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:08,024
MATT: 60 feet from there? I would say maybe,
<i>maybe</i> Vex.

1036
01:15:08,024 --> 01:15:11,078
SAM: Vex. How you looking? You looking rough?

1037
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:13,961
LAURA: I'm looking rough.

1038
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:18,207
SAM: Okay. Then I will sing that same song but as
a Healing Word instead.

1039
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:21,221
MATT: There you go, not wasted. Never a song
wasted.

1040
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:32,988
SAM: 2nd-level. Okay. And what is it? 2d4 plus
six. 11 points.

1041
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:35,534
LAURA: Oh, tight. Thank you.

1042
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:42,909
SAM: Oh! Okay. So I've just landed on his chest. I
look in there and there's no girl in there

1043
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:46,742
anymore. Shit. Do I see Bigby's Hand?

1044
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:47,879
MATT: Yes.

1045
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:49,835
SAM: Do I have enough movement to get to it?

1046
01:15:49,835 --> 01:15:54,251
MATT: You could try. Bigby's Hand is pulled back
currently, being controlled by the other Scanlan.

1047
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:56,027
You could try and leap into it.

1048
01:15:56,027 --> 01:16:01,326
SAM: Would I go out of melee range of this guy?
Would he get an attack of opportunity?

1049
01:16:01,326 --> 01:16:03,992
MATT: No. Because both you and Bigby's Hand are
technically right up against him.

1050
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,574
SAM: Okay. I'll grab that thumb instead.

1051
01:16:06,574 --> 01:16:07,960
(laughter)

1052
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,747
MATT: So you're still holding on to him or--

1053
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:14,229
SAM; I'm going to see if I can hold onto both.

1054
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:18,073
MATT: You reach out and you grab onto the edge of
the other Bigby's Hand.

1055
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,393
SAM: Yeah, I'm good.

1056
01:16:19,393 --> 01:16:21,078
MATT: Okay. That's your turn. Pike.

1057
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:30,114
ASHLEY: Okay. Is everybody 30 feet of me?
Because I can't really see the--

1058
01:16:30,114 --> 01:16:42,027
MATT: No. Let's see. It looks like Scanlan Two,
Vax, Keyleth, and Trinket are within 30 feet of you.

1059
01:16:42,027 --> 01:16:45,192
LAURA: Who, by the way, we didn't do meteor damage
for.

1060
01:16:45,192 --> 01:16:48,936
MATT: Go ahead and roll a saving throw.

1061
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:53,539
SAM: Oh no. This might be the happiest day of my
life.

1062
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:57,213
LAURA: You're a dick. Trinket rolls-- what is it,
a dex save?

1063
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:58,297
MATT: Yep.

1064
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,653
LAURA: 19.

1065
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:01,921
MATT: Trinket is in your necklace.

1066
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:04,842
SAM: But still alive.

1067
01:17:04,842 --> 01:17:07,845
LAURA: He only got 70 points of health.

1068
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:12,317
MATT: Yeah, he just took about 130 points of
damage.

1069
01:17:12,317 --> 01:17:16,877
LAURA: He couldn't do anything! Dang it. He really
wanted to help out.

1070
01:17:16,877 --> 01:17:18,383
LIAM: See you, Trink.

1071
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,552
TRAVIS: Take a seat, big guy.

1072
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,282
LAURA: He even rolled pretty good.

1073
01:17:23,282 --> 01:17:34,234
ASHLEY: So can I fly where I'm in the middle of
Scanlan, Percy, Vex, and Keyleth somehow? Within

1074
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,679
30 feet of everybody.

1075
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,948
MATT: Can do that. So you fly up.

1076
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:42,280
LAURA: Maybe not quite that high.

1077
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,466
MATT: Yeah, I'll take this down a little bit
there.

1078
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:51,635
ASHLEY: Maybe not over the little crescent.
Crevice is what I mean.

1079
01:17:51,635 --> 01:17:56,602
MATT: There we go. That'll put you there.

1080
01:17:56,602 --> 01:18:02,171
ASHLEY: Okay. And I'm going to cast Mass Cure
Wounds.

1081
01:18:02,171 --> 01:18:03,462
MATT: Okay.

1082
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:07,623
SAM: Who can she affect?

1083
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:10,156
MATT: The range on that is?

1084
01:18:10,156 --> 01:18:11,982
ASHLEY: 30 feet.

1085
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:16,988
MATT: That'll be Vex, Pike, and Keyleth.

1086
01:18:16,988 --> 01:18:18,021
TALIESIN: And me?

1087
01:18:18,021 --> 01:18:19,588
MATT: Sorry.

1088
01:18:19,588 --> 01:18:20,730
LAURA: And Scanlan Two.

1089
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:25,155
MATT: Scanlan Two can't heal. So what did you
roll?

1090
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:47,314
ASHLEY: Rolling now. Sorry, guys, sorry. Wait,
what's my spellcasting ability modifier? Why am I

1091
01:18:47,314 --> 01:18:48,510
blanking?

1092
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,194
LAURA: Is yours wisdom?

1093
01:18:50,194 --> 01:18:52,223
ASHLEY: Yes.

1094
01:18:52,223 --> 01:19:02,318
SAM: We're all going to die. Wait. Have you gone
yet? Liam, have you gone yet? Did you do

1095
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:03,730
anything?

1096
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:08,170
LIAM: Prepped for the future and forgot to do what
I wanted to do.

1097
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,923
MATT: So Pike, what was the end total?

1098
01:19:09,923 --> 01:19:11,369
ASHLEY: I think it's 29.

1099
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:12,939
MATT: Did you add the ten for your blessing?

1100
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:14,608
ASHLEY: Oh, no, I didn't.

1101
01:19:14,608 --> 01:19:20,506
MATT: So 39 points healed to Vex, Percy, and
Keyleth.

1102
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,142
ASHLEY: Wow, I didn't know that was a thing too.

1103
01:19:23,142 --> 01:19:24,532
LAURA: And yourself, Pike.

1104
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:25,996
ASHLEY: Oh, yes. Okay.

1105
01:19:25,996 --> 01:19:29,458
MATT: Yeah. Don't forget, the blessing you have
means whenever you heal anybody, they heal an

1106
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:31,520
additional ten points.

1107
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:38,679
TRAVIS: What about if you're in a strange tunnel?
And you can't see anybody. Do you heal?

1108
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:40,395
LIAM: You've got it made. You're safe.

1109
01:19:40,395 --> 01:19:44,282
TRAVIS: I mean, I hate to win a game all by myself
but I don't see a problem.

1110
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:51,459
MATT: (laughs) Does that end your turn, Pike?
You have your bonus action, still.

1111
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:53,596
ASHLEY: I'd like to move again.

1112
01:19:53,596 --> 01:20:00,495
MATT: Okay. You've moved about 40 feet so what's
your flying speed?

1113
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:08,369
LIAM: It's 40, isn't it?

1114
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:11,272
ASHLEY: Probably. Know what? I'm going to stay
because I don't know what my fucking speed is

1115
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:13,089
because I'm panicking now.

1116
01:20:13,089 --> 01:20:14,820
MATT: That's okay. I'm pretty sure--

1117
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,947
ASHLEY: I actually don't think I have that sheet.

1118
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:23,335
MATT: That's okay, I have it right here. Blessing
of the Everlight. Yep. Flying speed of 40 feet. So

1119
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:26,794
you've moved your maximum speed while flying and
you've used your action to cast. You can't move

1120
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:27,739
any further.

1121
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,561
LAURA: Do you have a bonus action you want to do?

1122
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:48,611
ASHLEY: Let's see here. Yeah, okay. So I am going
to cast Shield of Faith onto Vex, which gives a

1123
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,461
plus two bonus to AC.

1124
01:20:50,461 --> 01:20:56,328
LAURA: Oh, great. Thanks, Pike.

1125
01:20:56,328 --> 01:21:02,335
ASHLEY: You're welcome! Yeah, I forgot to get that
sheet when I was home, of the Blessing of the--

1126
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:05,110
wings. Wonderful wings.

1127
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:09,128
MATT: There you go. All right. That ends your
turn, Pike. Up to the top of the round, it is now

1128
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:10,567
Vecna's turn.

1129
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:12,270
LIAM: Hold onto your butts.

1130
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:13,945
MATT: Gets his legendary actions back.

1131
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:17,058
LAURA: Ashley, I think it might be in our text
chain between you and me.

1132
01:21:17,058 --> 01:21:18,805
ASHLEY: Okay. Let me find it.

1133
01:21:18,805 --> 01:21:25,750
MATT: Vecna, looking at the field around. You can
hear now, the distant blasts and impacts of the

1134
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:35,950
battle below in Vasselheim. You see this giant
looming shadow as one of the large mountain-sized

1135
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:44,881
arms of the titan swings in the air and causes
this brief eclipse over and then slams down into

1136
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:50,826
the center of the city. You see dust, rock, and
probably a dozen bodies flung in the air from the

1137
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:54,362
impact as they drift out of sight below.

1138
01:21:54,362 --> 01:21:57,299
SAM: They're okay. They're okay.

1139
01:21:57,299 --> 01:22:00,218
TRAVIS: Yeah, they got bounce houses. It's just
out. There was a festival going on.

1140
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:02,408
SAM: It was the yearly bounce house festival.

1141
01:22:02,408 --> 01:22:04,182
(laughter)

1142
01:22:04,182 --> 01:22:05,496
TRAVIS: It's all good.

1143
01:22:05,496 --> 01:22:06,926
MARISHA: That's so horrible.

1144
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:13,052
MATT: Glancing at this, he starts chuckling to
himself as the small gnome is crawling across the

1145
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:19,093
body and reaching out to the hand. "I do wish most
of these creatures would find their way straight

1146
01:22:19,093 --> 01:22:22,276
"to me. It's so much easier."

1147
01:22:22,276 --> 01:22:24,954
SAM: That's not good.

1148
01:22:24,954 --> 01:22:33,140
MATT: However, he looks off past you. "But you've
always been an issue. You're how you all escaped

1149
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:41,627
"from my clutches last time. Well, how's this for a
bit of irony, my dear?"

1150
01:22:41,627 --> 01:22:43,176
MARISHA: That's not good.

1151
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:45,011
LAURA: Who's he talking to? You?

1152
01:22:45,011 --> 01:22:46,600
MARISHA: I'm under 100 hit points.

1153
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,861
LAURA: <i>No</i>. Can you resist it?

1154
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:55,826
MARISHA: I can try and save it in time.

1155
01:22:55,826 --> 01:23:02,122
MATT: Yeah. 120 feet, you're in range. I need you
to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw,

1156
01:23:02,122 --> 01:23:03,024
Keyleth.

1157
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:04,736
LIAM: 1d4 from Bless.

1158
01:23:04,736 --> 01:23:06,098
SAM: Is this a spell?

1159
01:23:06,098 --> 01:23:07,202
MATT: Yes.

1160
01:23:07,202 --> 01:23:09,453
LAURA: Do it. This could be--

1161
01:23:09,453 --> 01:23:11,112
MARISHA: Can I add my inspiration to that?

1162
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,324
MATT: You can.

1163
01:23:13,324 --> 01:23:14,731
MARISHA: Saving throw, right?

1164
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:16,287
MATT: Yes, an intelligence saving throw.

1165
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,812
MARISHA: I have advantage because it's a spell,
right? I have advantage against spell saves?

1166
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:23,112
MATT: This is true. He has to choose to Counter--

1167
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:29,371
SAM: Scanlan One is going to Counterspell this. I
don't recognize this spell?

1168
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:35,722
MATT: Make an arcana check. Because you are Ioun--

1169
01:23:35,722 --> 01:23:37,938
TRAVIS: What's his physicality doing? Vecna--

1170
01:23:37,938 --> 01:23:43,952
MATT: His restored hand is reaching out towards
her as he glances down with a grin.

1171
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:45,273
SAM: 20.

1172
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:52,255
MATT: You've seen it used before against a green
dragon you once fought.

1173
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:54,382
LAURA: (gasp) Oh, Feeblemind.

1174
01:23:54,382 --> 01:23:55,979
SAM: Would I know what level to spell--

1175
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:58,346
MATT: You have not cast this spell. You do not
know.

1176
01:23:58,346 --> 01:23:59,622
SAM: Seven.

1177
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:07,001
MATT: Okay. It's an 8th-level spell so you still
have to roll. So I need you to go ahead and roll--

1178
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:17,652
MARISHA: Intelligence save. If he fails the--

1179
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:22,979
MATT: I need you to roll your spellcasting
ability. So roll and add your charisma bonus.

1180
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:24,510
SAM: 22.

1181
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:26,082
MATT: 22. That'll be enough.

1182
01:24:26,082 --> 01:24:28,344
(exclamations of relief)

1183
01:24:28,344 --> 01:24:30,340
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

1184
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:34,257
MARISHA: I am not a vegetable.

1185
01:24:34,257 --> 01:24:36,929
TALIESIN: No. You aren't.

1186
01:24:36,929 --> 01:24:42,515
TRAVIS: Matt, let's just call a truce.

1187
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:45,341
MATT: No.

1188
01:24:45,341 --> 01:24:47,927
TRAVIS: I think we've learned our lesson, okay?

1189
01:24:47,927 --> 01:24:49,542
MARISHA: You sweet, sweet man.

1190
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:56,306
TRAVIS: We'll give you Antarctica, okay? It's
really cold there.

1191
01:24:56,306 --> 01:25:07,730
MATT: As you finish the incantation, the spell
fizzles, his hand out, "Really?"

1192
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:14,860
MARISHA: Goddamn it. He's probably looking at you,
Scanlan. You have the book! We can't lose you! For real!

1193
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,412
SAM: Gulp.

1194
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:24,936
MATT: He's glaring at you. And with that, "Come
for a ride with me," (whooshing) and begins to

1195
01:25:24,936 --> 01:25:26,787
rise up even higher into the air.

1196
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:34,835
SAM: Can I hold onto Bigby? I wish to let him
leave while I hold onto Bigby.

1197
01:25:34,835 --> 01:25:37,975
MATT: Okay.

1198
01:25:37,975 --> 01:25:41,772
SAM: And get my attack of opportunity.

1199
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:45,211
(laughter)

1200
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:49,334
MARISHA: War Caster. Come on.

1201
01:25:49,334 --> 01:25:50,802
MATT: Go for it.

1202
01:25:50,802 --> 01:25:51,916
ASHLEY: Come on.

1203
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,402
LIAM: Bigby, make a sleight of hand check.

1204
01:25:53,402 --> 01:25:55,039
MARISHA: Don't fall to oblivion, please?

1205
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:56,602
TALIESIN: That would be bad.

1206
01:25:56,602 --> 01:26:00,343
MATT: It's okay. Lost the Hex. There we go.

1207
01:26:00,343 --> 01:26:05,808
LAURA: Hex is back, don't worry guys. I'm freaking
out. Oh god, he's so high.

1208
01:26:05,808 --> 01:26:07,728
TRAVIS: We need a weight for this.

1209
01:26:07,728 --> 01:26:12,046
MATT: It'll be fine. And you.

1210
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:13,962
TRAVIS: Should we take a picture in case it
falls?

1211
01:26:13,962 --> 01:26:15,398
TALIESIN: No, it should be good.

1212
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:18,740
LAURA: Unless everything falls. I'm going to take
a picture just because.

1213
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,869
MARISHA: Jenga.

1214
01:26:21,869 --> 01:26:24,236
TALIESIN: Now, really?

1215
01:26:24,236 --> 01:26:30,286
LIAM: Permanent Jenga.

1216
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:38,097
MATT: Putting you right around here as he adjusts
upward and you're clutching onto Bigby's Hand.

1217
01:26:38,097 --> 01:26:39,891
What are you doing as your attack of opportunity?

1218
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:44,543
SAM: Am I within melee range to make a Mythcarver
attack?

1219
01:26:44,543 --> 01:26:47,903
MATT: Sure. Go for it.

1220
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:56,204
SAM: I would like to let the spirit of the sword
overtake me.

1221
01:26:56,204 --> 01:27:03,043
MATT: It's an action to do it.

1222
01:27:03,043 --> 01:27:04,551
SAM: This is only a reaction?

1223
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:05,415
MATT: Correct.

1224
01:27:05,415 --> 01:27:12,432
SAM: So a single attack. Then I will use my War
Caster ability to cast Bigby's Hand at level six

1225
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:18,097
and I will say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says
you can motherfucking leave.

1226
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:23,655
(cheering)

1227
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:28,403
MATT: Since I don't have a second Bigby's Hand,
I'll go ahead and put this as Scanlan Two's Bigby

1228
01:27:28,403 --> 01:27:31,015
Hand with you and where do you want to place this
one?

1229
01:27:31,015 --> 01:27:33,533
SAM: Right on his fucking head.

1230
01:27:33,533 --> 01:27:38,274
MATT: There you go. There is the Bigby's Hand.

1231
01:27:38,274 --> 01:27:43,700
SAM: If he's flying up, I want him to go boop!

1232
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,963
MATT: Three Stooges bops him on the head? Go for
it.

1233
01:27:46,963 --> 01:27:52,683
SAM: All right. So this is 6th-level. 4d8 becomes
6d8, right?

1234
01:27:52,683 --> 01:27:54,141
MATT: Correct. Go ahead and roll to hit.

1235
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:57,248
SAM: Oh, roll to hit. Shit. Ooh, no!

1236
01:27:57,248 --> 01:28:00,778
LAURA: Oh no! Scanlan! Is it a one?

1237
01:28:00,778 --> 01:28:04,847
SAM: It's a two. Plus 11 is not going to hit.

1238
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:09,991
MATT: Nope. So Bigby's Hand goes to bop and as it
impacts--

1239
01:28:09,991 --> 01:28:11,986
LAURA: Can you inspire yourself?

1240
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:13,976
SAM: No, no. I've done so much this turn.

1241
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:19,532
MATT: Ability checks. It seems to hit but it gets
carried up with Vecna's form and it stands there

1242
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:23,140
in front of him. The fingers crack themselves and
get ready for the next round.

1243
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:27,081
SAM: 6th-level gone, 7th-level gone. Ready.

1244
01:28:27,081 --> 01:28:32,329
MATT: That's going to end Vecna's turn. Grog,
you're up. You're trying to make your way through

1245
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:34,316
this maze. I need you to make an intelligence
check.

1246
01:28:34,316 --> 01:28:35,682
MARISHA: Come on, Grog!

1247
01:28:35,682 --> 01:28:38,607
TRAVIS: Not a problem, you guys. Sit back.

1248
01:28:38,607 --> 01:28:43,831
MATT: Let me see if it's intelligence check or
intelligence save. It's an intelligence check. So

1249
01:28:43,831 --> 01:28:45,431
go ahead and roll a d20, add your intelligence
modifier.

1250
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:48,045
TRAVIS: My intelligence modifier?

1251
01:28:48,045 --> 01:28:49,490
MATT: Yes.

1252
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,799
TRAVIS: Two.

1253
01:28:50,799 --> 01:28:51,796
MATT: You rolled a two?

1254
01:28:51,796 --> 01:28:53,143
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rolled a four.

1255
01:28:53,143 --> 01:28:59,542
MATT: Okay. You spend the round rushing down-- you
see the left! You turn left and run ten feet and

1256
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:04,440
it looks like the same hallway you were just in.
So you rush forward and turn right. And you end up

1257
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,162
and it looks like it's in the same hallway you
were in. It seems to be this perpetual maze that

1258
01:29:08,162 --> 01:29:09,868
you can't seem to escape from.

1259
01:29:09,868 --> 01:29:22,611
TRAVIS: Okay. Pike! Scanlan! (whimpering) Okay,
okay, okay. This happened before, right? I should

1260
01:29:22,611 --> 01:29:31,327
be smart. I'm going to take out the cask of ale
and pour a little ale into a tankard and I'm going

1261
01:29:31,327 --> 01:29:37,050
to use the Amulet of the Drunkard to heal 2d4 plus
two.

1262
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:38,595
SAM: That's smart.

1263
01:29:38,595 --> 01:29:40,119
TRAVIS: I have two actions.

1264
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:42,108
SAM: And then spend the rest of my turn eating
mayonnaise.

1265
01:29:42,108 --> 01:29:43,540
(laughter)

1266
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:49,690
TRAVIS: Three. Seven so I heal nine points. And
then with my second action, my second hasted

1267
01:29:49,690 --> 01:30:00,661
action, I'm going to use my second wind to heal
1d10 plus my fighter level. Ten! Plus three is 13.

1268
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,119
So I heal 13 more points.

1269
01:30:02,119 --> 01:30:03,443
MATT: There you go.

1270
01:30:03,443 --> 01:30:08,599
TRAVIS: And that will end. And I will sit
(sipping) the rest of the ale and wait for

1271
01:30:08,599 --> 01:30:14,866
something. Keeping my mind on a small leather
pouch in my bag.

1272
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:16,300
MARISHA: Oh no.

1273
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,272
MATT: All righty.

1274
01:30:17,272 --> 01:30:19,773
LIAM: Oh boy.

1275
01:30:19,773 --> 01:30:22,194
TRAVIS: (laughter) What the fuck happened?

1276
01:30:22,194 --> 01:30:24,126
TALIESIN: That was a rough six seconds.

1277
01:30:24,126 --> 01:30:29,159
SAM: Guys, of all of us, I'm the one who's flying
right now. Should not be this way.

1278
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:34,281
MATT: Grog, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.

1279
01:30:34,281 --> 01:30:41,991
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to kick off on my broom
and I'm going to fly down to Velora--

1280
01:30:41,991 --> 01:30:43,289
LIAM: I move faster.

1281
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:45,133
LAURA: Yeah, but. Brother--

1282
01:30:45,133 --> 01:30:46,496
LIAM: I'm right after you.

1283
01:30:46,496 --> 01:30:48,555
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm before you and I saw her
fall.

1284
01:30:48,555 --> 01:30:49,759
LIAM: Your call.

1285
01:30:49,759 --> 01:30:50,825
MATT: So you dart down--

1286
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:51,945
LAURA: It's not like I want to do it.

1287
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:55,841
MATT: --with the broom. You can get to her, but
it'll take your movement and your action.

1288
01:30:55,841 --> 01:31:01,623
LAURA: Yeah, I'll get her.

1289
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:09,068
MATT: Okay. You swoop down, manage to grab her
body and you have her now in your arms.

1290
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:10,137
LAURA: Is she awake?

1291
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:11,429
MATT: No.

1292
01:31:11,429 --> 01:31:19,790
LAURA: Fuck. Do I see any kind of landing around
me, anywhere where she can set down safely?

1293
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:26,489
MATT: There is part of the tower, where it
impacted, there's still the stairway. It's just

1294
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:30,369
cusping up in the bottom of one of these pieces so
there's a little bit there.

1295
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:35,524
LAURA: All right. But I used all my movement. I
can't get to it and get her there.

1296
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:41,057
MATT: If you want to try and toss her?

1297
01:31:41,057 --> 01:31:43,233
LAURA: I'm not going to toss her. No, she's
unconscious.

1298
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,492
MATT: Then wait until next turn.

1299
01:31:44,492 --> 01:31:45,435
LAURA: Okay.

1300
01:31:45,435 --> 01:31:46,760
MATT: All right. That ends your turn.

1301
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,736
SAM: Wait, what did you do?

1302
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:50,192
LAURA: I had to go get Velora. She fucking fell.

1303
01:31:50,192 --> 01:31:51,391
SAM: Do we have to?

1304
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:53,420
LAURA: I'm not going to let my sister fall.

1305
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,498
SAM: It's an illusion, just let her go.

1306
01:31:54,498 --> 01:32:03,818
LIAM: Can I get within-- yeah, I definitely can.
I'm going to fly up and get within 50 feet of this dick.

1307
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:08,570
MATT: Okay. You can do that pretty easily. You're
pretty much on the same level as Scanlan and

1308
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,653
Bigby.

1309
01:32:09,653 --> 01:32:11,848
TALIESIN: He's engaged, by the way, with Bigby's
Hand.

1310
01:32:11,848 --> 01:32:16,449
LIAM: That's fine, but I have Vow of Enmity so I
have permanent advantage at the moment.

1311
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,710
MATT: You're able to get there.

1312
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:21,222
LIAM: Yeah, okay. So I'm going to--

1313
01:32:21,222 --> 01:32:25,357
SAM: We're literally playing three dimensional
chess, right?

1314
01:32:25,357 --> 01:32:26,390
MATT: Yeah.

1315
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:33,252
LIAM: I'm within 60 feet. I'm going to try to
throw at the tome in his hand and I'm going to

1316
01:32:33,252 --> 01:32:38,182
dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger.

1317
01:32:38,182 --> 01:32:39,823
SAM: Oh! Four daggers.

1318
01:32:39,823 --> 01:32:43,084
LIAM: So first one.

1319
01:32:43,084 --> 01:32:44,719
ASHLEY: Get that bitch.

1320
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:50,046
LIAM: First one is a 32. No it's not, it's a 33.

1321
01:32:50,046 --> 01:32:54,355
MATT: The first attack was with disadvantage
because you're aiming for something specifically.

1322
01:32:54,355 --> 01:32:55,301
LIAM: Oh, okay.

1323
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:57,126
LAURA: So that would have been a 13 was the lower
number.

1324
01:32:57,126 --> 01:32:59,202
LIAM: Oh, okay. 28.

1325
01:32:59,202 --> 01:33:01,392
MATT: Okay.

1326
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:11,452
LIAM: So this is sneak attack damage on the book.
Okay. So that's two plus eight is ten.

1327
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:19,102
SAM: The book. What if it's just Lady Chatterley's
Lover or something?

1328
01:33:19,102 --> 01:33:23,261
TRAVIS: Interdimensional chess with the Steve Jobs
of D&amp;D.

1329
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:28,018
LIAM: That is 36 for the first attack on the
book.

1330
01:33:28,018 --> 01:33:33,225
MATT: You watch as the tome that he's holding
spatters into pages and he's like, "Huh."

1331
01:33:33,225 --> 01:33:34,519
SAM: Aw shit.

1332
01:33:34,519 --> 01:33:35,834
MATT: You destroyed the tome.

1333
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:38,652
LAURA: Maybe he's just pretending like he's not
upset about it.

1334
01:33:38,652 --> 01:33:40,738
LIAM: I will now start unloading into his body.

1335
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:44,237
LAURA: It was his journal.

1336
01:33:44,237 --> 01:33:49,655
MARISHA: It's okay. Now Becky won't know I was
talking shit about her.

1337
01:33:49,655 --> 01:33:51,554
LIAM: That's a 17 which doesn't hit.

1338
01:33:51,554 --> 01:33:53,038
MATT: Right.

1339
01:33:53,038 --> 01:33:59,985
LIAM: Does not hit. Third attack is 20-- oh wait,
what did I say last? 17, 18?

1340
01:33:59,985 --> 01:34:01,530
MATT: 17.

1341
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:08,568
LIAM: 19. Doesn't hit. Next one is 29.

1342
01:34:08,568 --> 01:34:10,242
MATT: 29 hits.

1343
01:34:10,242 --> 01:34:12,341
LIAM: Okay. And this is just him.

1344
01:34:12,341 --> 01:34:14,015
LAURA: Was that a dog?

1345
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:19,279
MARISHA: I think it was the weird echo-y sound of
Ashley's pages turning.

1346
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:28,764
LIAM: 17 for that. And the last dagger does 25.

1347
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:30,764
MATT: 25 to hit?

1348
01:34:30,764 --> 01:34:31,648
LIAM: Yep.

1349
01:34:31,648 --> 01:34:32,635
MATT: That hits.

1350
01:34:32,635 --> 01:34:43,646
LIAM: And that is a measly little four. So that
was action, action, action, four. And that's it.

1351
01:34:43,646 --> 01:34:45,325
SAM: So what was your total damage?

1352
01:34:45,325 --> 01:34:47,303
LIAM: I don't know what the total was.

1353
01:34:47,303 --> 01:34:48,512
MATT: Succeeds on a save.

1354
01:34:48,512 --> 01:34:49,686
LIAM: I was after the book.

1355
01:34:49,686 --> 01:34:51,441
MATT: He hit him twice.

1356
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:54,005
LIAM: And I use my full movement to get where I am
right now?

1357
01:34:54,005 --> 01:34:58,121
MATT: To get where you are right here is for--
because you're hasted so--

1358
01:34:58,121 --> 01:34:59,386
LIAM: 120 feet.

1359
01:34:59,386 --> 01:35:03,425
MATT: Yeah, so no. It took you about 60 feet to
get there. You're right here currently.

1360
01:35:03,425 --> 01:35:12,648
LIAM: So then I will go to the piece of cake that
Percy's on in the dark portion, but again ten feet

1361
01:35:12,648 --> 01:35:13,995
flying above.

1362
01:35:13,995 --> 01:35:21,619
MATT: Right about there, we'll say. So tome's
destroyed. The daggers seem to slide into him. He

1363
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:23,039
maintains concentration.

1364
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:26,880
TALIESIN: Got to drop concentration. Someone's got
to hit him really hard.

1365
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,104
MATT: That ends your turn?

1366
01:35:28,104 --> 01:35:28,998
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1367
01:35:28,998 --> 01:35:30,731
MATT: Okay. Let's see here.

1368
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:33,479
MARISHA, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Wait.

1369
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:36,282
LIAM: Waiting to dive after Velora. Didn't have
anything ready.

1370
01:35:36,282 --> 01:35:37,841
MATT: Okay. End of your turn--

1371
01:35:37,841 --> 01:35:39,650
MARISHA: What do you have? What did you forget?

1372
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,782
SAM: No, no. I just didn't hit him. It's okay.

1373
01:35:41,782 --> 01:35:51,119
MATT: End of your turn, he's going to go ahead and
use two of his legendary actions. "All right.

1374
01:35:51,119 --> 01:36:00,373
"Seems the battlefield has been expended." As he
glares down at the gnome and the other gnome.

1375
01:36:00,373 --> 01:36:08,691
"Let's try this again." Make an intelligence
saving throw with advantage.

1376
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:11,819
SAM: I have no more reactions, right? We're still
in the same round.

1377
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:13,543
TRAVIS: No, this is a new round.

1378
01:36:13,543 --> 01:36:15,246
MATT: But it hasn't come back to his turn.

1379
01:36:15,246 --> 01:36:19,712
MARISHA: Druid die and don't fuck me, Gil. Don't
fuck me, Gil.

1380
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,968
SAM: That's cocked.

1381
01:36:21,968 --> 01:36:23,682
TRAVIS: No, it's on a page and a marker.

1382
01:36:23,682 --> 01:36:25,127
MARISHA: Well this one fell off.

1383
01:36:25,127 --> 01:36:26,671
SAM: What's that?

1384
01:36:26,671 --> 01:36:28,804
LAURA: Oh, well that. That doesn't.

1385
01:36:28,804 --> 01:36:30,109
SAM: What was it?

1386
01:36:30,109 --> 01:36:31,623
MARISHA: I mean, it was a floating three.

1387
01:36:31,623 --> 01:36:32,896
LIAM: It was cocked.

1388
01:36:32,896 --> 01:36:34,243
SAM: That was pretty cocked.

1389
01:36:34,243 --> 01:36:35,758
TRAVIS: It was on a page and a marker.

1390
01:36:35,758 --> 01:36:39,402
TALIESIN: I would be happy to let you take that. I
mean, personally I normally would, yeah.

1391
01:36:39,402 --> 01:36:43,785
TRAVIS: Just let it land flat. It's big.

1392
01:36:43,785 --> 01:36:47,127
MARISHA: Oh, no. It's a 13.

1393
01:36:47,127 --> 01:36:48,968
LIAM: With the d4?

1394
01:36:48,968 --> 01:36:50,080
MARISHA: No.

1395
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,599
LAURA: Oh, it's a 13.

1396
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:59,142
MARISHA: This isn't good. 15 plus my intelligence.
Oh, wait my intelligence. Oh, and I'm trained in--

1397
01:36:59,142 --> 01:37:07,071
Okay, wait. What did I just say? 17 plus eight.
25.

1398
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,526
MATT: Nope.

1399
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:11,943
LAURA: 25 isn't high enough? Oh, his thing is 26.

1400
01:37:11,943 --> 01:37:13,641
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's 26.

1401
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:14,605
MARISHA: Hang on.

1402
01:37:14,605 --> 01:37:19,107
MATT: So as the spell energy whips out from his
hand and entwines--

1403
01:37:19,107 --> 01:37:21,181
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh, you're inspired!

1404
01:37:21,181 --> 01:37:22,430
LAURA: That's right, you're inspired!

1405
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:23,742
MARISHA: Can I use my inspiration too?

1406
01:37:23,742 --> 01:37:25,418
MATT: That's what it's there for.

1407
01:37:25,418 --> 01:37:26,844
LIAM: All you need is one.

1408
01:37:26,844 --> 01:37:29,869
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, I'm good! Plus a six. 31.

1409
01:37:29,869 --> 01:37:38,018
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I'm going to pull my face off.

1410
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,584
SAM: Matt does not like that.

1411
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:48,835
MATT: The cocked die argument was not resolved.
You guys just rolled. We'll move forward with it,

1412
01:37:48,835 --> 01:37:51,943
but cutthroat from here on out.

1413
01:37:51,943 --> 01:37:53,279
TRAVIS: Okay.

1414
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:54,527
MARISHA: I can take it.

1415
01:37:54,527 --> 01:37:58,030
LIAM: Can I sacrifice one of my lucks as tribute?

1416
01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:00,510
MATT: Sacrifice all your lucks, if you want to.

1417
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:08,502
MARISHA: I asked you tell me what to do. If it was
cocked or not, you just stared and went like this.

1418
01:38:08,502 --> 01:38:12,016
MATT: I was thinking. It's fine. You resist the
spell. No effect, no impact.

1419
01:38:12,016 --> 01:38:13,864
MARISHA: You were thinking? What would you have
claimed?

1420
01:38:13,864 --> 01:38:16,383
LIAM and TALIESIN: Moving on.

1421
01:38:16,383 --> 01:38:18,640
MATT: We're moving on, it's all good.

1422
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:25,138
MARISHA: I don't want to get targeted later, Matt!
I want you to treat me fairly, okay?

1423
01:38:25,138 --> 01:38:30,499
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure he's missed you twice.
You're going to get targeted. He made me vanish in

1424
01:38:30,499 --> 01:38:31,642
one turn.

1425
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:35,927
MARISHA: I mean on the internet! I mean from
people being pissed at me. On the internet.

1426
01:38:35,927 --> 01:38:42,175
MATT: You're fine. That then brings us to the
initiative count 20. First off, the currently

1427
01:38:42,175 --> 01:38:48,854
existing skeletons all swarm in on Keyleth as the
only one standing. That's three attacks on you.

1428
01:38:48,854 --> 01:38:50,895
That is 12.

1429
01:38:50,895 --> 01:38:52,048
MARISHA: Miss.

1430
01:38:52,048 --> 01:38:53,132
MATT: 18?

1431
01:38:53,132 --> 01:38:53,925
MARISHA: Hits.

1432
01:38:53,925 --> 01:39:02,842
MATT: And no. So you get one hit. That's seven
points of slashing damage to you. Also, you feel

1433
01:39:02,842 --> 01:39:11,016
this pulse wave of dark energy swell out from
outside of Vecna in the vicinity. It cascades out,

1434
01:39:11,016 --> 01:39:14,324
encompassing the entirety of the area and then
fades and all of you feel a little colder on the

1435
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:20,113
inside. For the next round, anybody with
resistance to necrotic damage, it's negated.

1436
01:39:20,113 --> 01:39:24,577
LAURA: Am I within that area? If I went down to
save Velora?

1437
01:39:24,577 --> 01:39:27,533
TRAVIS: (laughter) Hey! Oh god.

1438
01:39:27,533 --> 01:39:30,303
MATT: Yep.

1439
01:39:30,303 --> 01:39:37,445
LIAM: I am sweating all over.

1440
01:39:37,445 --> 01:39:46,649
MATT: At this point in time, you hear this roar as
the clouds suddenly explode and part from the

1441
01:39:46,649 --> 01:39:54,822
nearby cyclone and you watch as two gloomstalkers
come swarming outward, wounded. One of them slaps

1442
01:39:54,822 --> 01:40:01,429
into the side of one of the islands and collapses.
A second one suddenly gets snatched in the jaws of

1443
01:40:01,429 --> 01:40:05,560
what, now, you see a sparkling brass dragon emerge
from the side.

1444
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,360
LIAM: Prayers are answered.

1445
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:18,254
MATT: As J'mon Sa Ord flies in, glances right up,
in the form of Devo'ssa, towards Vecna, and shouts

1446
01:40:18,254 --> 01:40:29,682
out in a deep, bellowing, dragon voice, "Your time
is done, old one. Fall before us all." (snarls, roars)

1447
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:35,928
And unleashes a torrent of flame upward in
the direction of both Vecna and Bigby's Hand.

1448
01:40:35,928 --> 01:40:37,678
LAURA: Thank god you're not there!

1449
01:40:37,678 --> 01:40:38,884
SAM: Sure.

1450
01:40:38,884 --> 01:40:52,959
MATT: So let's see. That is going to be DC 21.
Does not make the save. So that's 56 points of

1451
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:54,219
fire damage.

1452
01:40:54,219 --> 01:40:55,502
SAM: Oh, shnikes.

1453
01:40:55,502 --> 01:40:58,612
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. And he's got to roll for his
concentration.

1454
01:40:58,612 --> 01:41:00,488
MATT: Yep. Which he does not make.

1455
01:41:00,488 --> 01:41:01,758
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god!

1456
01:41:01,758 --> 01:41:02,978
TRAVIS: He doesn't make it?!

1457
01:41:02,978 --> 01:41:04,719
MARISHA: Are you coming back? Come back, come
back!

1458
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,793
MATT: He's going to use his fourth legendary
resistance to maintain it.

1459
01:41:06,793 --> 01:41:08,026
SAM: Four?!

1460
01:41:08,026 --> 01:41:09,230
ASHLEY: Come on!

1461
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:12,131
MATT: He does <i>not</i> want you on that field, Grog.

1462
01:41:12,131 --> 01:41:15,496
LAURA: With the Legendary Resistances. Do you get
legendary resistance every round?

1463
01:41:15,496 --> 01:41:20,376
MATT: No, he has a total of legendary resistances
he can use per day. Legendary actions he gets

1464
01:41:20,376 --> 01:41:21,578
every single round.

1465
01:41:21,578 --> 01:41:22,619
LAURA: Okay.

1466
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:23,840
LIAM: But he has 17.

1467
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,848
LAURA: Probably.

1468
01:41:24,848 --> 01:41:26,575
SAM: Is that 56 points of damage, that's with no
save?

1469
01:41:26,575 --> 01:41:29,254
MATT: Correct. Well a dexterity saving throw, if
he gets one.

1470
01:41:29,254 --> 01:41:35,557
SAM: I don't know what my dex is. I'm looking. AC,
dexterity of ten, so he rolled a 15. Did not.

1471
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:38,009
MATT: Nope. Nope, 56 points of damage.

1472
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,233
SAM: So he lost some points. But he has my hit
points? What does he have? I'm looking, I'm

1473
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:42,775
looking. Sorry. I got it, you go on with your
thing.

1474
01:41:42,775 --> 01:41:48,835
MATT: It's okay. Bigby's Hand has hit points equal
to your hit point maximum, so yeah.

1475
01:41:48,835 --> 01:41:50,382
SAM: Okay. So he's still alive.

1476
01:41:50,382 --> 01:41:56,598
MATT: Yeah. Okay. As soon as J'mon roars and shows
up, Vecna turns around. "Oh, no, we <i>cannot</i> have

1477
01:41:56,598 --> 01:42:02,843
"this." At the end of J'mon's turn--

1478
01:42:02,843 --> 01:42:04,752
MARISHA: Don't kill J'mon.

1479
01:42:04,752 --> 01:42:08,790
TALIESIN: They're such a nice miniature.

1480
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:15,557
MATT: He's going to look about the field and
consider what the current importance is, and

1481
01:42:15,557 --> 01:42:23,772
instead, glance downward and use two more
legendary actions to cast Dispel on your

1482
01:42:23,772 --> 01:42:28,714
Simulacrum. Understanding that you do not have any
reactions to counter.

1483
01:42:28,714 --> 01:42:31,187
MARISHA: You're going to use two to try and do
it?

1484
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:38,390
MATT: It's two to cast a spell. And with Dispel
Magic, is going to go ahead and cast it at

1485
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:40,574
5th-level.

1486
01:42:40,574 --> 01:42:44,245
SAM: I have no reaction, right? It hasn't come
back to me?

1487
01:42:44,245 --> 01:42:49,250
MATT: Nope. So at 6th-level, it's an 8th-level
spell, correct? Simulacrum?

1488
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,274
SAM: Yes.

1489
01:42:50,274 --> 01:42:51,611
LAURA: No, it's a 7th-level spell.

1490
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:53,014
MATT: Oh, but you cast it as an--

1491
01:42:53,014 --> 01:42:54,369
SAM: As Wish.

1492
01:42:54,369 --> 01:42:58,774
MATT: Right, but it just creates the spell, so
it'd be 9th. So with his 5th-level, he'd still

1493
01:42:58,774 --> 01:42:59,947
have to make an ability check.

1494
01:42:59,947 --> 01:43:01,252
TRAVIS: He has to roll.

1495
01:43:01,252 --> 01:43:03,326
MATT: Using the spellcasting ability, which is--

1496
01:43:03,326 --> 01:43:04,771
TALIESIN: Which is what?

1497
01:43:04,771 --> 01:43:06,341
LIAM: Intelligence and he's hexed?

1498
01:43:06,341 --> 01:43:10,763
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage on it. Intelligence
checks.

1499
01:43:10,763 --> 01:43:12,397
MATT: It's ability modifier, yeah, so he has
disadvantage.

1500
01:43:12,397 --> 01:43:16,759
MARISHA: Percy in the house.

1501
01:43:16,759 --> 01:43:21,005
MATT: That's a natural 20, but with disadvantage,
second one was a 13 plus ten, that's a 23, that's

1502
01:43:21,005 --> 01:43:26,504
enough. So with that, second Scanlan is dispelled.
Off the field.

1503
01:43:26,504 --> 01:43:28,940
LAURA: Do all of the things that we gave him fall
down to the ground?

1504
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:30,620
SAM: Including me.

1505
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:34,691
MATT: Well no, this Bigby's Hand. Yes, actually.

1506
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:38,103
TALIESIN: Does that Bigby's Hand vanish with the
caster?

1507
01:43:38,103 --> 01:43:40,437
MATT: Yes, it's a concentration spell.

1508
01:43:40,437 --> 01:43:42,051
TALIESIN: Well you got a little bit of a fall.

1509
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:47,094
MATT: So you start falling once more as Bigby's
Hand vanishes. You watch as Scanlan Two melts into

1510
01:43:47,094 --> 01:43:53,189
snow and water onto the ground, dripping off, the
clothing and items that he had clattering and

1511
01:43:53,189 --> 01:43:57,260
rolling off into oblivion. And you begin
plummeting.

1512
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:01,318
SAM: He died as he lived: making the world a
little bit wetter.

1513
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:05,356
TALIESIN: It's about 30 feet from where you are
right now.

1514
01:44:05,356 --> 01:44:07,223
LIAM: And it looks like he's above stone?

1515
01:44:07,223 --> 01:44:13,188
MATT: So you would fall to about there. You'd fall
prone. One thing, I'll put you there, laying you

1516
01:44:13,188 --> 01:44:16,340
prone, because otherwise you'll slide. And you
suffer--

1517
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:20,633
SAM: Can the audience even see me right now?

1518
01:44:20,633 --> 01:44:25,653
MATT: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage and
are knocked prone.

1519
01:44:25,653 --> 01:44:26,754
SAM: Okay.

1520
01:44:26,754 --> 01:44:28,997
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's doable.

1521
01:44:28,997 --> 01:44:31,117
SAM: 14 points of damage does not make me lose
concentration, right?

1522
01:44:31,117 --> 01:44:32,043
MATT: Nope.

1523
01:44:32,043 --> 01:44:33,156
SAM: Okay.

1524
01:44:33,156 --> 01:44:38,476
MATT: All right. Scanlan Two is gone. Keyleth,
it's your turn.

1525
01:44:38,476 --> 01:44:44,361
MARISHA: Oh, my god. Already. Oh, my god. You're
still fucking gone.

1526
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:47,547
LAURA: You should do it, but you should do it when
he comes back. That's the thing.

1527
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,798
TRAVIS: He's so high up, it doesn't matter right
now.

1528
01:44:49,798 --> 01:44:51,294
TALIESIN: Yeah, right now, it doesn't matter at
all.

1529
01:44:51,294 --> 01:44:52,702
LAURA: How high do they go?

1530
01:44:52,702 --> 01:44:54,193
MARISHA: 40 feet.

1531
01:44:54,193 --> 01:44:55,111
LAURA: Psh.

1532
01:44:55,111 --> 01:44:56,122
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1533
01:44:56,122 --> 01:45:01,032
MARISHA: Then I am going to burn my 9th-level
Shapechange.

1534
01:45:01,032 --> 01:45:03,589
MATT: Okay. What are you changing into?

1535
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:06,111
MARISHA: I'm going to turn into a planetar.

1536
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:07,592
LAURA: Yes!

1537
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:10,775
MARISHA: Pulling this ripcord.

1538
01:45:10,775 --> 01:45:17,806
MATT: He's going to use his-- Well no, what's the
range on Counterspell?

1539
01:45:17,806 --> 01:45:24,362
TRAVIS: He has one more legendary action. One more
legendary resistance.

1540
01:45:24,362 --> 01:45:30,018
SAM: What was the first hit that we took?

1541
01:45:30,018 --> 01:45:32,341
TRAVIS: The fireball. The meteor.

1542
01:45:32,341 --> 01:45:33,653
SAM: How many points?

1543
01:45:33,653 --> 01:45:35,400
TRAVIS: 66 if you saved.

1544
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:39,761
MATT: You're too far for him to Counterspell. So
you transform without an issue.

1545
01:45:39,761 --> 01:45:41,208
LAURA: Yes!

1546
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:43,721
MARISHA: And that's my action, right?

1547
01:45:43,721 --> 01:45:45,709
MATT: That is your action, yes.

1548
01:45:45,709 --> 01:45:51,456
MARISHA: I can move as the planetar?

1549
01:45:51,456 --> 01:45:56,506
MATT: Yep. What do you do? Where are you going,
Keyleth?

1550
01:45:56,506 --> 01:46:06,328
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to fly my 120 feet move
speed and come behind over here-ish, but in the air.

1551
01:46:06,328 --> 01:46:08,005
MATT: In the air?

1552
01:46:08,005 --> 01:46:10,903
LAURA: Really using all those platforms of yours,
Matt.

1553
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:12,383
MATT: I know.

1554
01:46:12,383 --> 01:46:18,759
MARISHA: All right, a little bit over, that's
workable.

1555
01:46:18,759 --> 01:46:20,377
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

1556
01:46:20,377 --> 01:46:24,428
MATT: There you go. Okay. Is that your turn,
Keyleth?

1557
01:46:24,428 --> 01:46:26,004
MARISHA: Yeah.

1558
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:27,446
LAURA: Do you have a bonus?

1559
01:46:27,446 --> 01:46:30,379
MARISHA: I mean, I don't think I can do a bonus as
a planetar, right?

1560
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:34,612
MATT: I mean, I don't think he has anything to do
as a bonus.

1561
01:46:34,612 --> 01:46:35,899
MARISHA: No.

1562
01:46:35,899 --> 01:46:37,927
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up.

1563
01:46:37,927 --> 01:46:43,302
TALIESIN: There's very little of value that I can
do right now. So I'm going to-- hmm?

1564
01:46:43,302 --> 01:46:44,578
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.

1565
01:46:44,578 --> 01:46:45,985
LAURA: Fucking shoot him.

1566
01:46:45,985 --> 01:46:48,266
TALIESIN: Not with my--

1567
01:46:48,266 --> 01:46:51,209
LIAM: Go fishing for Grog.

1568
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:53,713
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1569
01:46:53,713 --> 01:46:55,398
MARISHA: We've got to get Grog back.

1570
01:46:55,398 --> 01:47:05,118
TALIESIN: Yeah, I guess he's within range, so I'm
going to burn my bonus. I'm going to use my bonus

1571
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:11,375
to reload. I'm going to take my first three shots
and I'm going to take out those three skeletons

1572
01:47:11,375 --> 01:47:12,886
across the way.

1573
01:47:12,886 --> 01:47:14,379
LAURA: But there's not even anybody over there.

1574
01:47:14,379 --> 01:47:17,950
TALIESIN: I know, but it's going to refill my grit
so that I have a better chance of hitting him.

1575
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:19,931
TRAVIS: Grit farm. Do it.

1576
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:25,802
TALIESIN: So first shot. Actually, here, I'll take
all three. Actually, no, just in case something

1577
01:47:25,802 --> 01:47:26,827
terrible happens.

1578
01:47:26,827 --> 01:47:27,802
MATT: Yeah.

1579
01:47:27,802 --> 01:47:29,978
TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit?

1580
01:47:29,978 --> 01:47:30,980
MATT: That hits.

1581
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:35,494
TALIESIN: Second one is 25 to hit.

1582
01:47:35,494 --> 01:47:36,436
MATT: Hits.

1583
01:47:36,436 --> 01:47:42,043
TALIESIN: And the third one is a crit. So I get
one back already.

1584
01:47:42,043 --> 01:47:47,380
MARISHA: Crit on a 19.

1585
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,770
MATT: You're up after this, Scanlan.

1586
01:47:48,770 --> 01:48:01,861
TALIESIN: And then, let's do 1d10 plus 1d6. First
one takes 17 points of damage plus four psychic.

1587
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:07,049
MATT: 17 points of damage plus four psychic?
Scattered and destroyed.

1588
01:48:07,049 --> 01:48:12,547
TALIESIN: Second one takes 12 points of damage
plus two psychic.

1589
01:48:12,547 --> 01:48:14,778
MATT: Okay. He also is destroyed.

1590
01:48:14,778 --> 01:48:27,704
TALIESIN: And the other one takes eight-- The other
one is fucking toast. I'm getting into twenties

1591
01:48:27,704 --> 01:48:35,768
here. Not worth it. So that's one grit, two grit,
three grit, so I have four grit back. I'm burning

1592
01:48:35,768 --> 01:48:46,637
my very last action surge now that I have some
bloody grit. I'm trying to remember, can I pull

1593
01:48:46,637 --> 01:48:55,655
Sharpshooter with a grit point, or can I not take
Sharpshooter with--

1594
01:48:55,655 --> 01:49:00,122
MATT: You can. You can't combine different
abilities that spend grit points, but you can

1595
01:49:00,122 --> 01:49:02,914
combine Sharpshooter, which is a feat, with any
attacks you make.

1596
01:49:02,914 --> 01:49:08,678
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a Sharpshooter plus
violent because what else are we going to do? So

1597
01:49:08,678 --> 01:49:12,714
sharpshooter plus violent shot--

1598
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:15,184
MATT: So you're just using one point for violent?

1599
01:49:15,184 --> 01:49:22,226
TALIESIN: One point for violent because it makes
it a gamble. I don't have advantage, I don't know

1600
01:49:22,226 --> 01:49:30,323
why I'm rolling like I do. Here we go. So with
Sharpshooter. Yes! It's a crit!

1601
01:49:30,323 --> 01:49:33,588
MARISHA: Oh my god, you and the 19s!

1602
01:49:33,588 --> 01:49:35,176
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19.

1603
01:49:35,176 --> 01:49:36,373
MARISHA: Crit on a 19!

1604
01:49:36,373 --> 01:49:37,546
TALIESIN: So crit on a 19!

1605
01:49:37,546 --> 01:49:39,631
MATT: Which, violent shot, which is double dice
from your weapon.

1606
01:49:39,631 --> 01:49:44,116
TALIESIN: Which is double dice. Not double
psychic, just double damage, right? Yeah.

1607
01:49:44,116 --> 01:49:46,575
MATT: Correct.

1608
01:49:46,575 --> 01:49:47,770
TALIESIN: It's just double.

1609
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,937
SAM: The golden snitch.

1610
01:49:48,937 --> 01:49:52,860
TALIESIN: So that is that. Oh, man, this is great.
So there's that, and then I have the psychic.

1611
01:49:52,860 --> 01:50:03,246
That's right here, so damage is-- oh, my god-- 11
and then I double that.

1612
01:50:03,246 --> 01:50:07,810
MATT: Correct. You double. So it's 11, that's 22.

1613
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:21,303
TALIESIN: No, I rolled them twice, so 11,
(counting) 48.

1614
01:50:21,303 --> 01:50:25,183
MATT: Okay, so how much dice does it do per shot?
It's a d10, right?

1615
01:50:25,248 --> 01:50:27,188
TALIESIN: 1d10, so with violent shot--

1616
01:50:27,188 --> 01:50:28,245
MATT: It's 2d10.

1617
01:50:28,245 --> 01:50:29,928
TALIESIN: It's 2d10, and then I double the d10,
plus 18.

1618
01:50:29,928 --> 01:50:32,335
MATT: Right, yeah. Great. So what's the total?

1619
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:33,758
TALIESIN: Now I'm adding the psychic damage.

1620
01:50:33,758 --> 01:50:35,691
MATT: Right, and how much damage is that total?

1621
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:41,602
TALIESIN: 48 plus nine points of psychic damage.

1622
01:50:41,602 --> 01:50:44,935
MATT: Okay. 57 points, all righty.

1623
01:50:44,935 --> 01:50:48,453
MARISHA: Come on. Bring him back.

1624
01:50:48,453 --> 01:50:55,085
MATT: No, that's a failure on his concentration.
He's not going to use his legendary resistance. He

1625
01:50:55,085 --> 01:51:04,000
feels pretty comfortable high up. So with that,
Grog's giant form reappears right where he left,

1626
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,309
right there. The maze disappears around you and
you land back on the space. Looking around, your

1627
01:51:09,309 --> 01:51:13,729
friends are in different places, there's a giant
brass dragon above you. You see an angel flying

1628
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:17,719
above, and you can see on the ground, hurting--
Scanlan.

1629
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:19,699
TRAVIS: Ale solves everything.

1630
01:51:19,699 --> 01:51:22,671
SAM: You just took a drink and you're back.

1631
01:51:22,671 --> 01:51:24,977
MATT: Anywhere you want to move, anything else you
want to do?

1632
01:51:24,977 --> 01:51:29,032
TALIESIN: I've got two more shots. And remember
that you take half that damage at the end of your

1633
01:51:29,032 --> 01:51:30,338
next turn.

1634
01:51:30,338 --> 01:51:34,056
MATT: Correct, so that'll be 23 points next turn.
Got it.

1635
01:51:34,056 --> 01:51:39,074
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. So for my next shot, I'm going
to burn a point. I wonder if a leg-wing shot would

1636
01:51:39,074 --> 01:51:45,443
do anything here. All right, I'm going to burn a
grit, and I'm not going to do Sharpshooter. I'm

1637
01:51:45,443 --> 01:51:54,513
just going to take a shot. And that's 24 to hit?

1638
01:51:54,513 --> 01:51:56,005
MATT: 24 hits.

1639
01:51:56,005 --> 01:52:07,682
TALIESIN: And that's 13 points of damage plus four
points of psychic. And strength save versus 20?

1640
01:52:07,682 --> 01:52:11,303
MATT: That is a 17, so--

1641
01:52:11,303 --> 01:52:13,531
TALIESIN: He drops a little bit of--

1642
01:52:13,531 --> 01:52:14,953
MATT: How much does he drop? Does it say?

1643
01:52:14,953 --> 01:52:19,475
TALIESIN: Well I don't remember. We used to say
prone? So I don't know what you would call that.

1644
01:52:19,475 --> 01:52:20,794
MATT: Oh, does it say prone?

1645
01:52:20,794 --> 01:52:21,737
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1646
01:52:21,737 --> 01:52:22,801
MATT: He's immune to prone.

1647
01:52:22,801 --> 01:52:26,886
TALIESIN: Oh, no, but I thought it was like prone
if you're standing but 15 feet if you're in the air?

1648
01:52:26,886 --> 01:52:31,450
MATT: No, as it says, on a hit, the target takes
normal damage and must make a strength saving

1649
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:35,814
throw or be knocked prone, which would affect
things normally if they were flying, but he's

1650
01:52:35,814 --> 01:52:36,922
immune to prone.

1651
01:52:36,922 --> 01:52:49,899
TALIESIN: All right, that's fair. That was fine.
Just for fun, then, let's take one more shot and

1652
01:52:49,899 --> 01:52:57,793
see what happens. That's a natural 20.

1653
01:52:57,793 --> 01:52:59,526
SAM: It really is.

1654
01:52:59,526 --> 01:53:05,042
TALIESIN: It really is. I'm going to die. I'm
going to fucking die. He's going to kill me now.

1655
01:53:05,042 --> 01:53:06,874
LIAM: But gloriously.

1656
01:53:06,874 --> 01:53:22,263
TALIESIN: Aw, man, I have made a terrible mistake.
That's 20 points of damage plus, oh really? 12

1657
01:53:22,263 --> 01:53:29,441
points of psychic damage. So 20 points plus 12
which is 32, and his next round, he takes half

1658
01:53:29,441 --> 01:53:30,789
that as well.

1659
01:53:30,789 --> 01:53:36,987
MATT: So next round, he takes a total of 39 points
of damage automatically from the hemorrhaging

1660
01:53:36,987 --> 01:53:43,407
shot. So as each shot (impacts). The crit hits,
and you watch him go, (snarling). And as that

1661
01:53:43,407 --> 01:53:47,066
impact hits, you watch as part of the armor
cracks, and there's a brief little wound in the

1662
01:53:47,066 --> 01:53:54,443
shoulder where you see a glow of energy behind.
You see the brief, a tiny little chink in the

1663
01:53:54,443 --> 01:53:56,929
armor of his avatar form.

1664
01:53:56,929 --> 01:54:01,056
TALIESIN: Oh, god, I'm not comfortable with that.
And I'm taking another ten feet back. I'm starting

1665
01:54:01,056 --> 01:54:04,198
to back up a little bit, because that was more
than I was intending.

1666
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:06,258
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn.

1667
01:54:06,258 --> 01:54:07,767
TALIESIN: (breathless) Yes, that ends my turn.

1668
01:54:07,767 --> 01:54:09,185
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

1669
01:54:09,185 --> 01:54:11,632
LAURA: Okay, Scanlan, you've got this.

1670
01:54:11,632 --> 01:54:12,992
SAM: Bigby's Hand is still near him?

1671
01:54:12,992 --> 01:54:13,933
MATT: Yep.

1672
01:54:13,933 --> 01:54:15,756
SAM: Bigby's Hand will attack and strike.

1673
01:54:15,756 --> 01:54:17,687
MATT: All right, that's a bonus action, go for
it.

1674
01:54:17,687 --> 01:54:19,270
SAM: Two.

1675
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:21,407
LAURA: What the fuck, get rid of that dice, Sam.

1676
01:54:21,407 --> 01:54:23,591
TALIESIN: That's the only die you ever roll, man.

1677
01:54:23,591 --> 01:54:26,830
SAM: That's my bonus action. Can I use my action
to strike again?

1678
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:32,785
MATT: If you wanted to? Generally, I think it's
supposed to be like you can, as a bonus action,

1679
01:54:32,785 --> 01:54:34,993
cause it to do again, so your action has to be
something else.

1680
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:40,094
SAM: I have to do something else. That's fine.
Hey, question, before we go on. Earlier, you said

1681
01:54:40,094 --> 01:54:45,352
something, when Ashley did something, and you
said, "And when anyone heals in the future, it's a

1682
01:54:45,352 --> 01:54:47,446
"plus ten," or something. What was that?

1683
01:54:47,446 --> 01:54:50,161
MATT: That's <i>her</i> blessing from the Everlight. So
only she gets that.

1684
01:54:50,161 --> 01:54:52,090
SAM: So when she heals anyone--

1685
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:57,501
MATT: It's plus ten to whatever she heals. That's
part of the gift she got from her god.

1686
01:54:57,501 --> 01:55:00,205
TRAVIS: How high up is Vecna above the deck, would
you say?

1687
01:55:00,205 --> 01:55:01,753
MATT: Above the deck, let's see--

1688
01:55:01,753 --> 01:55:05,907
TALIESIN: Got to get you up there, man.

1689
01:55:05,907 --> 01:55:07,421
MATT: 75 feet up.

1690
01:55:07,421 --> 01:55:12,630
TALIESIN: Never mind, it's not my turn anymore, I
can't say anything.

1691
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:14,801
SAM: 75, so I can't even hit him with anything,
really.

1692
01:55:14,801 --> 01:55:22,043
TALIESIN: Heal people. Or do a--

1693
01:55:22,043 --> 01:55:23,633
ASHLEY: Healing potion?

1694
01:55:23,633 --> 01:55:26,525
LAURA: He's got a 9th-level spell. Could do
something.

1695
01:55:26,525 --> 01:55:28,688
SAM: She's a planetar?

1696
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:30,161
LAURA: Yeah.

1697
01:55:30,161 --> 01:55:34,525
SAM: I turn into a giant eagle. And I'll fly Grog
up.

1698
01:55:34,525 --> 01:55:35,723
TALIESIN: Yeah!

1699
01:55:35,723 --> 01:55:39,066
MATT: He casts Polymorph?

1700
01:55:39,066 --> 01:55:40,115
SAM: Polymorph, on myself.

1701
01:55:40,115 --> 01:55:41,330
MATT: Oh, shit.

1702
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:42,487
TALIESIN: That's clutch.

1703
01:55:42,487 --> 01:55:44,419
MATT: All right.

1704
01:55:44,419 --> 01:55:47,470
SAM: I stand up using half my movement.

1705
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:50,779
MATT: Yeah. So you'll have half of your eagle's
fly form.

1706
01:55:50,779 --> 01:55:53,309
SAM: Yeah. I don't know how far they can fly.

1707
01:55:53,309 --> 01:55:55,118
MARISHA: I think 60 feet.

1708
01:55:55,118 --> 01:56:00,408
SAM: I'm sure it takes time to get under him and
stuff.

1709
01:56:00,408 --> 01:56:03,186
MATT: He's pretty heavy in his large size, so I
would say--

1710
01:56:03,186 --> 01:56:05,580
SAM: Oh, he's Enlarged. He's engorged.

1711
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,160
MATT: You're at half speed while he's on your
back. Even your fly speed.

1712
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,409
SAM: So it was--

1713
01:56:09,409 --> 01:56:11,763
MATT: What's the fly speed of the eagle?

1714
01:56:11,763 --> 01:56:13,205
LIAM: Giant eagle is 80 feet.

1715
01:56:13,205 --> 01:56:14,474
SAM: So it's 40.

1716
01:56:14,474 --> 01:56:16,636
MATT: And you used half your movement, so you can
get 20 feet up, yeah.

1717
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:20,444
TALIESIN: It's cool, next round you can do it.

1718
01:56:20,444 --> 01:56:23,612
SAM: Next round I can get close.

1719
01:56:23,612 --> 01:56:25,594
TALIESIN: Next round he can leap off you.

1720
01:56:25,594 --> 01:56:28,943
MATT: We'll put you there and we'll say you're at
20 feet. I'll acknowledge that here.

1721
01:56:28,943 --> 01:56:30,549
LAURA: Oh no!

1722
01:56:30,549 --> 01:56:32,595
LIAM: (screeches)

1723
01:56:32,595 --> 01:56:34,411
MATT: I need to put tape on the eagle. I can fix
that.

1724
01:56:34,411 --> 01:56:37,353
LAURA: Do you want to hand me that-- Oh, you
already got tape, you're prepared.

1725
01:56:37,353 --> 01:56:40,336
MATT: I came prepared. All righty.

1726
01:56:40,336 --> 01:56:45,813
MARISHA: We're like an 80s B-level fantasy movie
right now.

1727
01:56:45,813 --> 01:56:47,704
LAURA: This is amazing, Matt.

1728
01:56:47,704 --> 01:56:48,894
LIAM: It's beautiful.

1729
01:56:48,894 --> 01:56:51,258
TRAVIS: I've seen buffets that are uglier than
this.

1730
01:56:51,258 --> 01:56:54,803
MATT: Well thank you. Wait until the battle's over
before you thank me.

1731
01:56:54,803 --> 01:56:56,167
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

1732
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:59,432
SAM: No, no, that's fine. I mean, Bigby's Hand
couldn't have moved down and gotten Grog and gone

1733
01:56:59,432 --> 01:57:00,803
back up, right?

1734
01:57:00,803 --> 01:57:03,892
MATT: I mean, it would have taken a couple rounds,
but you've already made your choices.

1735
01:57:03,892 --> 01:57:05,611
SAM: Sure. So Bigby's Hand's gone.

1736
01:57:05,611 --> 01:57:07,444
MATT: Because it's a concentration spell, yeah.

1737
01:57:07,444 --> 01:57:11,191
SAM: Ooh, he wants to hold on.

1738
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,275
MATT: I know.

1739
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,962
SAM: (singing) Hold on to your love--

1740
01:57:13,962 --> 01:57:17,517
MATT: All righty. So ending Scanlan's turn, Pike,
you're up.

1741
01:57:17,517 --> 01:57:29,111
ASHLEY: Okay! So I'm going to-- Tried and true
right now. I'm going to Guiding Bolt at

1742
01:57:29,111 --> 01:57:31,422
6th-level.

1743
01:57:31,422 --> 01:57:32,640
LAURA: Fuck yeah.

1744
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,489
MATT: Guiding Bolt at 6th-level, all right.

1745
01:57:34,489 --> 01:57:39,575
LAURA: Guiding Bolt at 6th-level does 9d6 radiant
damage.

1746
01:57:39,575 --> 01:57:44,380
SAM: Up what hole? Up the butt?

1747
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:46,146
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, Vlad the Impaler him.

1748
01:57:46,146 --> 01:57:48,023
MATT: Make a ranged spell attack, Pike.

1749
01:57:48,023 --> 01:57:49,692
LIAM: His bone-dry anus?

1750
01:57:49,692 --> 01:57:51,212
TRAVIS: What does that mean? Disadvantage?

1751
01:57:51,212 --> 01:57:55,008
MATT: Yeah, it's 120 feet, so you're in range. No,
it means you have to roll a d20 and then add your

1752
01:57:55,008 --> 01:57:57,296
ranged spell attack modifier.

1753
01:57:57,296 --> 01:58:00,788
ASHLEY: Can I fly close to start?

1754
01:58:00,788 --> 01:58:04,551
MATT: Yeah, so you can move a little closer, but
you have-- He's in range. You have 120-foot range,

1755
01:58:04,551 --> 01:58:06,689
so you don't <i>have</i> to get closer, but you can if
you'd like to.

1756
01:58:06,689 --> 01:58:09,784
ASHLEY: Might as well.

1757
01:58:09,784 --> 01:58:14,759
MATT: Okay. I'll say for the purposes of-- We'll
know that J'mon is up there.

1758
01:58:14,759 --> 01:58:18,760
MARISHA and LAURA: Shamone.

1759
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:32,697
MATT: Keeping an eye at that point there. Pike
will rise up and move closer still to about there.

1760
01:58:32,697 --> 01:58:35,264
All right. And what'd you roll?

1761
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,866
ASHLEY: A natural 20.

1762
01:58:36,866 --> 01:58:38,903
TRAVIS: Did you really?!

1763
01:58:38,903 --> 01:58:40,768
TALIESIN: You got one!

1764
01:58:40,768 --> 01:58:42,797
ASHLEY: I fucking did.

1765
01:58:42,797 --> 01:58:45,962
(laughter)

1766
01:58:45,962 --> 01:58:47,684
LAURA: Does that double the dice?

1767
01:58:47,684 --> 01:58:48,765
LIAM: Yes.

1768
01:58:48,765 --> 01:58:51,083
MATT: It doubles damage, yeah. It's one of the few
ways you can crit with spell damage, is if it's a

1769
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:55,117
ranged spell attack. So go ahead and roll your
damage.

1770
01:58:55,117 --> 01:58:56,857
ASHLEY: I'm taking a picture of this right now.

1771
01:58:56,857 --> 01:58:58,086
MARISHA: Oh, my god, amazing.

1772
01:58:58,086 --> 01:59:00,884
LAURA: 18d6.

1773
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:05,489
MARISHA: Well you roll, and then you double what
you roll. So roll <i>big!</i>

1774
01:59:05,489 --> 01:59:10,576
ASHLEY: Not nine?

1775
01:59:10,576 --> 01:59:12,498
LAURA: It's nine, just double it.

1776
01:59:12,498 --> 01:59:13,728
MATT: Roll 9d6.

1777
01:59:13,728 --> 01:59:15,040
MARISHA: Come on!

1778
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,410
LIAM: Big money.

1779
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,138
LAURA: I like that we're looking like we can see.

1780
01:59:18,138 --> 01:59:20,065
ASHLEY: Oh, big money. Oh shit, that's really big
money.

1781
01:59:20,065 --> 01:59:21,214
MARISHA: Is it?

1782
01:59:21,214 --> 01:59:26,361
ASHLEY: Okay, hold on. Oh my god, I'm shaking so
bad you guys. Okay.

1783
01:59:26,361 --> 01:59:31,671
TRAVIS: You got it, you got it. Count your death.

1784
01:59:31,671 --> 01:59:33,906
ASHLEY: Hold on.

1785
01:59:33,906 --> 01:59:38,205
TRAVIS: I've started to pull out sections of my
beard.

1786
01:59:38,205 --> 01:59:40,402
TALIESIN: I know, I'm freaking out.

1787
01:59:40,402 --> 01:59:42,134
LIAM and TALIESIN: Pickle Rick!

1788
01:59:42,134 --> 01:59:44,090
LAURA: Pickle Pike!

1789
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:49,215
ASHLEY: (sighs) Hold on.

1790
01:59:49,215 --> 01:59:51,278
TRAVIS: You're good.

1791
01:59:51,278 --> 01:59:54,966
LIAM: This is the holy light swirling in a ball
before it takes off.

1792
01:59:54,966 --> 01:59:56,527
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is the Ka--

1793
01:59:56,527 --> 02:00:00,819
TRAVIS and LAURA and TALIESIN: --Me--Ha--Me--!

1794
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:04,173
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

1795
02:00:04,173 --> 02:00:09,206
ASHLEY: Sorry, I keep losing count. I'm sorry. I'm
so nervous.

1796
02:00:09,206 --> 02:00:18,500
TALIESIN: No, it happens to the best of us. I
know, this is a lot.

1797
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:21,490
ASHLEY: Okay. 36.

1798
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:26,262
MATT: Times two. 72 points of radiant damage.

1799
02:00:26,262 --> 02:00:31,369
MARISHA: Whoa! We need to start getting some
trammels in him, I think, y'all.

1800
02:00:31,369 --> 02:00:37,630
MATT: And the next attack on him has advantage.
You watch as Pike, her wings expanded, flies up in

1801
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:44,421
the direction. As she does, she glances upward,
clutching the holy symbol of Sarenrae in her hand.

1802
02:00:44,421 --> 02:00:49,892
Her eyes, which have already been glowing since
she brought the blessing upon her physical form,

1803
02:00:49,892 --> 02:00:52,688
now begin to burst with vibrant energy. As she
extends her hand in front, you watch as a singular

1804
02:00:52,688 --> 02:00:58,062
comet of divine wrath rockets upward, slamming
into the front of Vecna's chest. As the impact

1805
02:00:58,062 --> 02:01:04,077
hits, he screams out and as he looks down, you can
see the anger of his eye flaring, the energy now

1806
02:01:04,077 --> 02:01:09,436
sparking outward with sheer hatred, and you can
see the area of the chest where Percy had hit and

1807
02:01:09,436 --> 02:01:14,587
slightly exposed a wound, there's now a gaping
wound in the chest where the Guiding Bolt has hit,

1808
02:01:14,587 --> 02:01:18,108
and now the energy is crackling across his body,
guiding the next attack against him.

1809
02:01:18,108 --> 02:01:23,085
ASHLEY: Wait, I miscalculated. It's 37. Is that
what I said?

1810
02:01:23,085 --> 02:01:24,405
TRAVIS: You said 36.

1811
02:01:24,405 --> 02:01:29,320
MATT: So that's 74 points of damage. All righty,
cool. All right, Pike, that's your action and your

1812
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,112
move. Anything else you want to do?

1813
02:01:31,112 --> 02:01:32,581
SAM: Heal some shit!

1814
02:01:32,581 --> 02:01:38,812
ASHLEY: Yeah. Am I able to move back down closer
to Scanlan?

1815
02:01:38,812 --> 02:01:42,373
MATT: You can get maybe down ten feet.

1816
02:01:42,373 --> 02:01:46,772
SAM: Remember, Scanlan is heading up towards you
now as an eagle.

1817
02:01:46,772 --> 02:01:50,213
MATT: As an eagle. Technically, he's at full
health as an eagle.

1818
02:01:50,213 --> 02:01:54,250
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay.

1819
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:58,004
SAM: But we are within range of you.

1820
02:01:58,004 --> 02:02:00,655
MATT: Yes, Grog and Scanlan are within range of
you.

1821
02:02:00,655 --> 02:02:03,116
TALIESIN: I am not.

1822
02:02:03,116 --> 02:02:05,055
SAM: You can heal yourself if you're down.

1823
02:02:05,055 --> 02:02:07,235
MARISHA: Are you down? Are you looking rough?

1824
02:02:07,235 --> 02:02:11,300
ASHLEY: I'm not terrible, but let me do-- shit.

1825
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:14,876
TRAVIS: If you're under 100, heal yourself.

1826
02:02:14,876 --> 02:02:16,211
MARISHA: Yeah.

1827
02:02:16,211 --> 02:02:23,763
ASHLEY: I'm not. Okay, I'm going to Healing Word
two.

1828
02:02:23,763 --> 02:02:29,099
MATT: Okay, so roll 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier
to yourself.

1829
02:02:29,099 --> 02:02:31,680
ASHLEY: For Scanlan.

1830
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:34,118
MATT: Scanlan's at full health as an eagle.

1831
02:02:34,118 --> 02:02:36,934
ASHLEY: Okay, fuck it.

1832
02:02:36,934 --> 02:02:38,135
LAURA: For Grog.

1833
02:02:38,135 --> 02:02:39,327
ASHLEY: For Grog!

1834
02:02:39,327 --> 02:02:44,987
MATT: Okay, so 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier to
Grog. End of your turn, Vecna's going to use a

1835
02:02:44,987 --> 02:02:56,060
fifth and final legendary action to cast Firebolt
again. That's going to be-- oh man. It's going to

1836
02:02:56,060 --> 02:03:03,116
go for the eagle. Seeing the massive man holding
the sword bent on his destruction in his hand,

1837
02:03:03,116 --> 02:03:04,985
wants to stop that ascension.

1838
02:03:04,985 --> 02:03:08,642
ASHLEY: 15, Grog.

1839
02:03:08,642 --> 02:03:10,168
TRAVIS: 15. Thank you.

1840
02:03:10,168 --> 02:03:17,370
MATT: He pulled it back, or he would have gone
with him when he transported to the maze. That is

1841
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:19,536
a 30?

1842
02:03:19,536 --> 02:03:21,382
SAM: Against what?

1843
02:03:21,382 --> 02:03:22,569
MATT: It hits.

1844
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:25,610
ASHLEY: Plus ten!

1845
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:26,666
TALIESIN: To Grog.

1846
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:28,044
ASHLEY: To Grog, yeah.

1847
02:03:28,044 --> 02:03:29,754
TRAVIS: 15 plus ten.

1848
02:03:29,754 --> 02:03:37,388
MATT: 25 points of fire damage.

1849
02:03:37,388 --> 02:03:39,008
SAM: 26 hit points.

1850
02:03:39,008 --> 02:03:40,369
MATT: So you have one hit point left.

1851
02:03:40,369 --> 02:03:43,418
SAM: (laughs) Right?

1852
02:03:43,418 --> 02:03:45,702
TALIESIN: Is that right?

1853
02:03:45,702 --> 02:03:46,852
SAM: It's what it says.

1854
02:03:46,852 --> 02:03:50,207
LAURA: That's fine. You're still 20 feet in the
air.

1855
02:03:50,207 --> 02:03:58,935
MATT: That ends Pike's turn. Top of the round.
Vecna gets all his legendary actions back. Vecna,

1856
02:03:58,935 --> 02:04:05,446
who sees you all swarming upward, says, "I've
enjoyed toying with you, playing, and all this

1857
02:04:05,446 --> 02:04:17,153
"fantastical experience of seeing what you're
capable of, but you've severely angered me." He

1858
02:04:17,153 --> 02:04:26,104
clutches up with his hand across where the wound
is. "Let's end this now." With his other hand,

1859
02:04:26,104 --> 02:04:29,738
raising up, you can see the stitch marks on the
flesh of the reformed hand of Vecna begin to

1860
02:04:29,738 --> 02:04:38,220
bulge, and as he does, the sky above you cracks
open a second time as large arcane meteors come

1861
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,412
slamming down from above.

1862
02:04:40,412 --> 02:04:45,881
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

1863
02:04:45,881 --> 02:04:52,718
MATT: (singing) More than one 9th-level spell. He
is a fucking god.

1864
02:04:52,718 --> 02:04:58,508
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh jeez. Oh no.

1865
02:04:58,508 --> 02:05:13,047
MATT: To the ground, so that's a 40-foot radius,
so it would hit Scanlan and Grog. Pike, as it

1866
02:05:13,047 --> 02:05:29,305
impacts here, Pike, you're just out of range of
the explosions. Your planetar form, however, is

1867
02:05:29,305 --> 02:05:30,615
caught in the blast radius.

1868
02:05:30,615 --> 02:05:31,698
MARISHA: It is?

1869
02:05:31,698 --> 02:05:34,045
MATT: So everybody but Pike and Vex are affected
by this.

1870
02:05:34,045 --> 02:05:35,604
SAM: How many meteors?

1871
02:05:35,604 --> 02:05:40,706
MATT: This is another 20d6 fire damage and 20d6
bludgeoning damage.

1872
02:05:40,706 --> 02:05:45,419
MARISHA: I get advantage on spell saves, right?

1873
02:05:45,419 --> 02:05:49,594
MATT: I need dexterity saving throws from
everybody who was affected

1874
02:05:49,594 --> 02:05:51,706
MARISHA: Spell save, right?

1875
02:05:51,706 --> 02:05:57,042
TALIESIN: Okay, so I have advantage from Cabal's
Ruin.

1876
02:05:57,042 --> 02:05:58,699
LIAM: Hashtag blessed.

1877
02:05:58,699 --> 02:06:00,168
MATT: Are you using your reaction on this one?

1878
02:06:00,168 --> 02:06:11,816
TALIESIN: Not yet. I can wait-- actually, yeah.
I'm going to use my reaction, my once per short

1879
02:06:11,816 --> 02:06:13,309
rest, my spell swallow.

1880
02:06:13,309 --> 02:06:15,383
MATT: Scanlan?

1881
02:06:15,383 --> 02:06:17,548
SAM: Eagle rolled a ten.

1882
02:06:17,548 --> 02:06:20,464
MATT: That's a failure. Grog?

1883
02:06:20,464 --> 02:06:21,734
TRAVIS: 18.

1884
02:06:21,734 --> 02:06:23,190
MATT: Failure.

1885
02:06:23,190 --> 02:06:24,106
LIAM: 31.

1886
02:06:24,106 --> 02:06:25,358
MATT: 31. Success.

1887
02:06:25,358 --> 02:06:27,334
MARISHA: 21.

1888
02:06:27,334 --> 02:06:31,488
MATT: Both failures, so that is 61 points of
bludgeoning damage.

1889
02:06:31,488 --> 02:06:33,875
SAM: We're going to need you, Pike.

1890
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:35,775
MATT: And 71 points of fire damage.

1891
02:06:35,775 --> 02:06:37,312
MARISHA: 61 and 71?

1892
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:41,443
MATT: Correct, so 132 points of damage unless you
have resistance against one or the other.

1893
02:06:41,443 --> 02:06:43,717
SAM: What are the two types of damage?

1894
02:06:43,717 --> 02:06:44,949
LAURA: Bludgeoning and fire.

1895
02:06:44,949 --> 02:06:47,940
MARISHA: Oh, I have resistance against bludgeoning
as a planetar.

1896
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:55,887
MATT: Yeah, so it would be 30 and 71, so you take
101 points of damage in your planetar form.

1897
02:06:55,887 --> 02:07:01,278
TALIESIN: I take half damage because I'm
swallowing the spell.

1898
02:07:01,278 --> 02:07:04,683
MATT: So you take 65. 66.

1899
02:07:04,683 --> 02:07:06,085
TALIESIN: 66 points of damage?

1900
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:09,163
TRAVIS: I have resistance to both, so it's 68?

1901
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:19,836
MATT: 66, we'll say. You take the bulk of that.
The eagle takes the one, and you transform, and

1902
02:07:19,836 --> 02:07:22,217
you both plummet back down from where you were,
hitting the ground.

1903
02:07:22,217 --> 02:07:23,795
SAM: I'm dead.

1904
02:07:23,795 --> 02:07:26,296
MATT: Scanlan is unconscious.

1905
02:07:26,296 --> 02:07:29,726
LAURA: You took less than a hundred. How many hit
points did you have?

1906
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:33,849
SAM: I had a hundred points as me, and one point
as an eagle.

1907
02:07:33,849 --> 02:07:37,857
MATT: Scanlan is unconscious on the ground.

1908
02:07:37,857 --> 02:07:40,218
LAURA: Oh, you don't restore all your hit points
with Polymorph.

1909
02:07:40,218 --> 02:07:41,728
MARISHA: No, it carries over.

1910
02:07:41,728 --> 02:07:43,888
MATT: But you do have Death Ward.

1911
02:07:43,888 --> 02:07:46,315
(cheering)

1912
02:07:46,315 --> 02:07:51,668
MATT: The moment you hit zero hit points, you come
back to consciousness. You're still prone, but

1913
02:07:51,668 --> 02:07:52,908
you're at one hit point.

1914
02:07:52,908 --> 02:07:55,108
SAM: Oh god.

1915
02:07:55,108 --> 02:08:01,778
MATT: All righty, so Grog took that. Keyleth,
you've marked that down, as well? The damage from

1916
02:08:01,778 --> 02:08:07,043
that one? All right, Percival, since it's a
9th-level spell, you gain nine charges.

1917
02:08:07,043 --> 02:08:08,904
TALIESIN: I've got nine charges left on Cabal,
baby.

1918
02:08:08,904 --> 02:08:13,687
MARISHA: Oh, that's magical!

1919
02:08:13,687 --> 02:08:23,675
MATT: And with that, knowing the circumstance,
Vecna is going to arrange himself across the

1920
02:08:23,675 --> 02:08:28,144
battlefield to this side.

1921
02:08:28,144 --> 02:08:31,664
MARISHA: That was rough.

1922
02:08:31,664 --> 02:08:42,894
MATT: All right, that's going to end Vecna's turn,
and for the sake that it is now 9:00, let's take a

1923
02:08:42,894 --> 02:08:44,604
quick bathroom break.

1924
02:08:44,604 --> 02:08:45,855
SAM: What? No!

1925
02:08:45,855 --> 02:08:47,731
LAURA: We're starting up at Grog's turn.

1926
02:08:47,731 --> 02:08:55,222
MATT: We're starting up at Grog's turn. We'll be
right back here. Guys, we'll see you back here in

1927
02:08:55,222 --> 02:09:02,414
just a minute. We'll make it quick, because we've
got to rush in. Fast. Hold tight, and we'll see

1928
02:09:02,414 --> 02:09:06,377
where the rest of this battle will go. See you
guys in a minute.

1929
02:09:06,377 --> 02:26:28,399
[break]

1930
02:26:28,399 --> 02:26:35,865
MATT: And welcome back everybody. Before we get
back into the fray, the winner in the chat tonight

1931
02:26:35,865 --> 02:26:38,279
of the Wyrmwood giveaway was TwoOrThreeGodzillas.

1932
02:26:38,279 --> 02:26:40,796
(laughter)

1933
02:26:40,796 --> 02:26:45,595
MATT: Congratulations, TwoOrThreeGodzillas. Enjoy
dividing it amongst yourselves. Hope it's a good

1934
02:26:45,595 --> 02:26:55,503
time for you, small box for a big creature, well
done. So bringing it back in, last we left off,

1935
02:26:55,503 --> 02:27:01,222
Vecna had just sent down another blast of arcane
meteors pulled from beyond the realm slamming into

1936
02:27:01,222 --> 02:27:05,477
the ground and sundering many of you, sending
Scanlan into a point of near death where he popped

1937
02:27:05,477 --> 02:27:11,302
back thanks to an aptly cast Death Ward in
preparation for this combat. Vecna's round has

1938
02:27:11,302 --> 02:27:15,138
ended with him shifting over to the opposite side
of the battlefield. Grog, you're up.

1939
02:27:15,138 --> 02:27:21,081
TRAVIS: From where I was released by the eagle
when Scanlan changed back, I'm 20 feet off the

1940
02:27:21,081 --> 02:27:24,095
deck. How far, if I was hereish--

1941
02:27:24,095 --> 02:27:30,274
MATT: If you were here and had gone straight up
then fell back down, which technically would have

1942
02:27:30,274 --> 02:27:40,085
dealt nine points of bludgeoning damage, reduced
to four because you're ever raging. You've landed

1943
02:27:40,085 --> 02:27:41,186
on the ground.

1944
02:27:41,186 --> 02:27:45,348
TRAVIS: And he is off the deck how high about now?
What would you ballpark it?

1945
02:27:45,348 --> 02:27:53,527
MATT: Vecna? I'd say probably 80 feet from down
there.

1946
02:27:53,527 --> 02:28:12,583
TRAVIS: This is one of those moments. I'm going to
hold my action until I am within melee of, or

1947
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:14,719
fucking closer to--

1948
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:16,037
MATT: What action are you holding?

1949
02:28:16,037 --> 02:28:17,527
TRAVIS: My attack action.

1950
02:28:17,527 --> 02:28:19,836
SAM: No bonus actions?

1951
02:28:19,836 --> 02:28:27,862
TRAVIS: I'm a barbarian. I have shit for bonus
actions.

1952
02:28:27,862 --> 02:28:30,172
SAM: You can't pour anything in my mouth?

1953
02:28:30,172 --> 02:28:32,606
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh!

1954
02:28:32,606 --> 02:28:35,832
LAURA: That's an action, not a bonus.

1955
02:28:35,832 --> 02:28:41,376
MATT: To pour it into something else's mouth is an
action, but yourself is a bonus.

1956
02:28:41,376 --> 02:28:45,614
SAM: I don't know. Is that right, Matt?

1957
02:28:45,614 --> 02:28:47,383
TRAVIS: Can I take it myself with a bonus action?

1958
02:28:47,383 --> 02:28:52,640
MATT: That's one of the house rules we started the
campaign with. Up to you, if you want to apply it

1959
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:53,751
to Scanlan--

1960
02:28:53,751 --> 02:28:55,704
SAM: Because you won't get any bonuses once you
hold your action.

1961
02:28:55,704 --> 02:28:57,645
TRAVIS: I know, I know.

1962
02:28:57,645 --> 02:28:59,592
MATT: He's at one hit point on the ground.

1963
02:28:59,592 --> 02:29:01,447
TRAVIS: I don't want to take it, then.

1964
02:29:01,447 --> 02:29:02,604
LAURA: Why?

1965
02:29:02,604 --> 02:29:04,350
MATT: So you're holding your attack action?

1966
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:06,689
TRAVIS: I'm holding my attack action until I'm
closer.

1967
02:29:06,689 --> 02:29:13,385
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. At the end of
Grog's turn, Vecna will use his first legendary

1968
02:29:13,385 --> 02:29:14,567
action--

1969
02:29:14,567 --> 02:29:28,798
TRAVIS: Tell you what, I'll use my movement speed
to move closer to being underneath, on the other

1970
02:29:28,798 --> 02:29:29,956
side of Vax.

1971
02:29:29,956 --> 02:29:32,400
MATT: Okay, so you move right there, gotcha. At
the end of your turn, Vecna going to use two

1972
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:37,554
legendary actions, actually. And across the way is
going to glance over at the brass dragon that's

1973
02:29:37,554 --> 02:29:51,895
there who's flying up in the space here, but all
the platforms. And Vecna staring about at

1974
02:29:51,895 --> 02:29:57,361
everything on the battlefield. "You make me
uncomfortable with your presence, ancient one,"

1975
02:29:57,361 --> 02:30:08,354
and is going to cast-- I believe this space is
large enough for gargantuan--

1976
02:30:08,354 --> 02:30:12,122
LAURA: Is he going to try and do what he did to
Grog?

1977
02:30:12,122 --> 02:30:24,104
MATT: Nope! Instead, he's going to create a
Forcecage around J'mon. No saving throw necessary,

1978
02:30:24,104 --> 02:30:36,030
you watch as J'mons wings through their flapping are 
pulled in as a similar cage to what you saw of force energy

1979
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:43,570
deeper within the tower has now encased the brass
dragon's form. You see J'mon in their Devo'ssa

1980
02:30:43,570 --> 02:30:48,109
form is now held within this Forcecage aloft
within the air, the dragon begins slamming into

1981
02:30:48,109 --> 02:30:51,598
each side and momentarily seems to be trying to
figure out a way to escape.

1982
02:30:51,598 --> 02:30:54,405
TRAVIS: Are they taking any damage from banging
against the cage?

1983
02:30:54,405 --> 02:30:55,852
MATT: Nope.

1984
02:30:55,852 --> 02:30:58,651
LAURA: I wonder if that's concentration too? It
probably is, right?

1985
02:30:58,651 --> 02:31:01,383
SAM: He probably can concentrate on 
more than one thing.

1986
02:31:01,452 --> 02:31:02,593
TALIESIN: No.

1987
02:31:02,593 --> 02:31:03,993
SAM: No? I don't know.

1988
02:31:03,993 --> 02:31:07,938
MATT: So up here in this space is a brass dragon
currently encased in a Forcecage.

1989
02:31:07,938 --> 02:31:11,204
TRAVIS: Oh, I was going to be like, J'mon give me
a ride, and I forgot to say it.

1990
02:31:11,204 --> 02:31:14,405
MARISHA: And now you can't.

1991
02:31:14,405 --> 02:31:16,035
TRAVIS: He just got pet stored, so--

1992
02:31:16,035 --> 02:31:22,003
MATT: So that brings us back to Vex's turn.

1993
02:31:22,003 --> 02:31:26,939
LAURA: Okay, I'm down there with Velora, can I
tuck her away in a safe spot?

1994
02:31:26,939 --> 02:31:33,052
MATT: You can tuck her in a place where it was
once a solid piece of stone that cracked.

1995
02:31:33,052 --> 02:31:35,199
LAURA: Under my hat, definitely.

1996
02:31:35,199 --> 02:31:40,613
MATT: There is an element of what was once solid
packed stone that was the central column of the

1997
02:31:40,613 --> 02:31:48,539
tower that is now exposed broken rock, and the
staircase that spirals around it before it

1998
02:31:48,539 --> 02:31:52,211
abruptly ends and tendrils of green energy begin
that hold the platforms aloft.

1999
02:31:52,211 --> 02:31:54,261
LAURA: And she's unconscious?

2000
02:31:54,261 --> 02:31:56,599
MATT: She's dead.

2001
02:31:56,599 --> 02:31:58,518
LAURA: She's <i>dead</i>?!

2002
02:31:58,518 --> 02:32:00,444
TRAVIS: Oh god, here we go.

2003
02:32:00,444 --> 02:32:03,667
LAURA: Did everybody know that and I didn't know
that?

2004
02:32:03,667 --> 02:32:06,454
TRAVIS: She was burning and smoking and falling.

2005
02:32:06,454 --> 02:32:12,178
MATT: As you grab her body and pull up to the edge
to look for a place you look down and there is no

2006
02:32:12,178 --> 02:32:13,423
breath.

2007
02:32:13,423 --> 02:32:17,030
TRAVIS: She took 60 plus points of damage.

2008
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:18,230
LAURA: Fuck.

2009
02:32:18,230 --> 02:32:19,976
ASHLEY: We can fix her later.

2010
02:32:19,976 --> 02:32:23,528
LIAM: If anybody survives.

2011
02:32:23,528 --> 02:32:34,988
LAURA: I tuck her little body away and hope that
it's safe, fucking shit balls. Can I fly back up?

2012
02:32:34,988 --> 02:32:40,681
MATT: You go ahead and set her aside, down below
in an area where it's safe and you fly up and at

2013
02:32:40,681 --> 02:32:46,441
your full fly speed you can get to the edge of one
of these platforms.

2014
02:32:46,441 --> 02:32:52,581
LAURA: Yeah, I'll hover away, I'll fly straight up
from where I was with her.

2015
02:32:52,581 --> 02:32:53,879
SAM: And attack?

2016
02:32:53,879 --> 02:32:55,770
LAURA: Can I attack him?

2017
02:32:55,770 --> 02:33:02,062
MATT: I would say to carefully set her down that
would be your action and your movement, but you'd

2018
02:33:02,062 --> 02:33:03,310
get back into the fray.

2019
02:33:03,310 --> 02:33:04,703
SAM: Bonus action?

2020
02:33:04,703 --> 02:33:07,741
LAURA: I mean, my bonus actions are--

2021
02:33:07,741 --> 02:33:18,877
MATT: To be fair, helping going after Velora did
manage to avoid you a impact of a meteor storm.

2022
02:33:18,877 --> 02:33:21,652
TRAVIS: That is true.

2023
02:33:21,652 --> 02:33:27,946
LAURA: Okay, tell you what: he knows that I'm down
there, I'm sure he sees all but can I come up and

2024
02:33:27,946 --> 02:33:33,393
hover in the air and bonus action hide behind that
wall?

2025
02:33:33,393 --> 02:33:40,650
MATT: What I'd say is you'd come up this way and
hide behind the wall? I'll place you here but

2026
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:43,091
we'll assume you're behind.

2027
02:33:43,091 --> 02:33:46,852
LAURA: Do I roll for stealth?

2028
02:33:46,852 --> 02:33:49,087
MATT: Yes.

2029
02:33:49,087 --> 02:33:58,487
LAURA: Did you see how that dice did that? It was
like, fuck you. 24.

2030
02:33:58,487 --> 02:34:07,950
MATT: Good to know. That bring us at the end of
your turn. He's now going to spend another

2031
02:34:07,950 --> 02:34:12,898
legendary action to cast Firebolt at Scanlan.

2032
02:34:12,898 --> 02:34:14,195
LIAM: Goddamn it.

2033
02:34:14,195 --> 02:34:16,850
TALIESIN: Is that one legendary action, or two?

2034
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:18,685
MATT: One legendary action for cantrips, two for a
full spell.

2035
02:34:18,685 --> 02:34:20,307
TRAVIS: And that's his third of this round.

2036
02:34:20,307 --> 02:34:22,130
SAM: Shit.

2037
02:34:22,130 --> 02:34:26,554
LAURA: So you've got one hit point now? So it'll
knock you down?

2038
02:34:26,554 --> 02:34:28,062
SAM: Do I try to Counterspell this?

2039
02:34:28,062 --> 02:34:32,719
MATT: Well you're prone, so he has disadvantage on
the attack roll.

2040
02:34:32,719 --> 02:34:34,730
SAM: Then can I do Cutting Words? Is it a melee
attack?

2041
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:36,170
MATT: What's the range on Cutting Words?

2042
02:34:36,170 --> 02:34:37,275
SAM: Probably 60 feet.

2043
02:34:37,275 --> 02:34:42,331
MATT: He's not within range. So that's a 28 to
hit.

2044
02:34:42,331 --> 02:34:43,621
SAM: That misses.

2045
02:34:43,621 --> 02:34:46,919
MATT: You suffer--

2046
02:34:46,919 --> 02:34:50,311
TRAVIS: One point of damage.

2047
02:34:50,311 --> 02:34:55,878
MATT: 17 points of fire damage and are now
unconscious once more.

2048
02:34:55,878 --> 02:34:57,464
LAURA: Great.

2049
02:34:57,464 --> 02:34:58,772
TALIESIN: It's fine.

2050
02:34:58,772 --> 02:35:04,481
MATT: That brings us to Vax's turn.

2051
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:11,163
LIAM: With my hasted action, I will cast Lay on
Hands on Scanlan and bring him back up.

2052
02:35:11,163 --> 02:35:18,990
SAM: Great! That was fast!

2053
02:35:18,990 --> 02:35:20,751
TALIESIN: This was not going to last long.

2054
02:35:20,751 --> 02:35:25,862
LIAM: He's got the book, right? Am I within 120 feet
of Vecna's face?

2055
02:35:25,862 --> 02:35:29,363
MATT: Yes, you are.

2056
02:35:29,363 --> 02:35:30,835
LIAM: I'm going to latch onto Vecna's face.

2057
02:35:30,835 --> 02:35:32,855
LAURA: You're going to fly straight at his face?

2058
02:35:32,855 --> 02:35:33,888
LIAM: I'm going to fly straight at his face.

2059
02:35:33,888 --> 02:35:35,426
MATT: Okay.

2060
02:35:35,426 --> 02:35:38,275
LIAM: That's all my movement to get there?

2061
02:35:38,275 --> 02:35:41,404
MATT: Yes, and you're now currently--

2062
02:35:41,404 --> 02:35:44,572
LIAM: On his face.

2063
02:35:44,572 --> 02:35:54,072
MATT: Yes, on his face, which in his form, his
head is roughly that large so you'd be clutching

2064
02:35:54,072 --> 02:35:55,462
his ears.

2065
02:35:55,462 --> 02:35:57,948
LIAM: I'm flying right in his face.

2066
02:35:57,948 --> 02:36:08,775
MATT: You can feel the crackling energy of the
gaping socket where the greenish arcane bursts are

2067
02:36:08,775 --> 02:36:15,048
pulsing from the anger and sheer ability of his
arcane prowess, each one of these tendrils is

2068
02:36:15,048 --> 02:36:20,833
arcing around, two of them crawl across you and
your skin goes numb in the places where they

2069
02:36:20,833 --> 02:36:22,725
touch, and it's cold.

2070
02:36:22,725 --> 02:36:28,831
LIAM: I will use paladin action to dagger-dagger
him in the face.

2071
02:36:28,831 --> 02:36:31,174
MATT: Wait, hold on a second. You used your action
to--

2072
02:36:31,174 --> 02:36:32,737
LIAM: Hasted action.

2073
02:36:32,737 --> 02:36:38,070
MATT: Hasted action can only be used as an attack,
hide object or--

2074
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:44,074
LIAM: That's fine, so I use my regular action to
Lay on Hands, and my hasted action to attack him

2075
02:36:44,074 --> 02:36:46,697
once in the face, maybe more, we'll see.

2076
02:36:46,697 --> 02:36:50,728
SAM: Don't keep us in suspense for too long!

2077
02:36:50,728 --> 02:36:52,516
LIAM: I'm going to use my first luck of the
night.

2078
02:36:52,516 --> 02:36:56,842
LAURA: Oh my lord!

2079
02:36:56,842 --> 02:37:03,830
LIAM: Bad rolls. 24.

2080
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:05,896
MATT: That hits.

2081
02:37:05,896 --> 02:37:11,275
SAM: Took three rolls and a bonus.

2082
02:37:11,275 --> 02:37:18,505
LIAM: Up top! And I'm going to dump 2nd-level
Smite.

2083
02:37:18,505 --> 02:37:22,119
MATT: And he's undead, so you get the additional
smite damage.

2084
02:37:22,119 --> 02:37:24,152
LIAM: Yeah he is, motherfucker.

2085
02:37:24,152 --> 02:37:31,298
SAM: Pass me that <i>not bottle of alcohol.</i>

2086
02:37:31,298 --> 02:37:32,458
MARISHA: Okay.

2087
02:37:32,458 --> 02:37:34,367
TRAVIS: Pass the gatorade?

2088
02:37:34,367 --> 02:37:51,936
LIAM: I need to write this down before I forget
it. So before the Smite, it's 44. And Jesus, I'm

2089
02:37:51,936 --> 02:38:05,090
forgetting everything. 2d8 plus additional for
undead which is 12, so 56, and how much extra for

2090
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:06,823
the undead, I can't remember. 1d8? 2d8?

2091
02:38:06,823 --> 02:38:07,966
MATT: It's an extra 1d8.

2092
02:38:07,966 --> 02:38:11,955
LIAM: Seven.

2093
02:38:11,955 --> 02:38:13,677
TRAVIS and LIAM: 63.

2094
02:38:13,677 --> 02:38:21,703
MATT: Woo! 63 points of damage as you rush up,
wings up before right in the face, pull back and

2095
02:38:21,703 --> 02:38:27,885
jam your blade into the side of the skull as it
hits, you can see the skull crack open like a

2096
02:38:27,885 --> 02:38:33,262
spider web of wound. As you pull the blade back,
you can see the sutures are already pulling

2097
02:38:33,262 --> 02:38:39,759
themselves together and as you're this close to
him now you can see there is a slow binding of

2098
02:38:39,759 --> 02:38:44,475
wounds, there is an element of regeneration to his
body. Apparently in his god-like ascension the

2099
02:38:44,475 --> 02:38:48,461
body itself continually rebuilds.

2100
02:38:48,461 --> 02:38:51,794
LAURA: Makes sense. He's a god. Of course he
does.

2101
02:38:51,794 --> 02:38:54,165
MARISHA: I mean, I would want that if
I was a god.

2102
02:38:54,165 --> 02:38:56,402
LAURA: That would be a feat I would take if I
ascended to godhood.

2103
02:38:56,402 --> 02:38:58,669
MARISHA: Definitely put that on the list.

2104
02:38:58,669 --> 02:39:01,167
MATT: Level six divinity, I'll take that feat.

2105
02:39:01,167 --> 02:39:09,669
LIAM: Bonus action, I will whisper to him: No
fear. And stick one last dagger in his face.

2106
02:39:09,669 --> 02:39:11,330
MATT: You have to roll to hit first.

2107
02:39:11,330 --> 02:39:18,136
LIAM: Oh, do I? That's fine, that hits, that's
36.

2108
02:39:18,136 --> 02:39:19,850
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

2109
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:21,115
MARISHA: You don't crit on a 19?

2110
02:39:21,115 --> 02:39:25,662
LIAM: Yes I do with Whisper, but it's not
Whisper.

2111
02:39:25,662 --> 02:39:26,671
MATT: It's not Whisper.

2112
02:39:26,671 --> 02:39:27,665
LIAM: Wait.

2113
02:39:27,665 --> 02:39:28,671
MATT: But you didn't throw it.

2114
02:39:28,671 --> 02:39:30,217
LIAM: So it is a crit?

2115
02:39:30,217 --> 02:39:32,280
MATT: So the dice?

2116
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:40,012
LIAM: It's nothing though, the damage is nothing
but he does have to roll a save, he'll be fine, or

2117
02:39:40,012 --> 02:39:41,235
be afraid of me.

2118
02:39:41,235 --> 02:39:46,063
LAURA: He's immune to fear.

2119
02:39:46,063 --> 02:39:47,164
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

2120
02:39:47,164 --> 02:39:49,837
TALIESIN: Did he take his bleed damage from me?

2121
02:39:49,837 --> 02:39:52,246
MATT: He did, the 39 points of damage.

2122
02:39:52,246 --> 02:39:54,429
LIAM: Six big points, six big points.

2123
02:39:54,429 --> 02:39:56,151
MATT: That's a nasty crit!

2124
02:39:56,151 --> 02:40:00,081
LIAM: Wait that's Whisper, plus-- 14 big points.

2125
02:40:00,081 --> 02:40:05,099
MATT: 14 points. So as you rush up and jam the
blade in the side the second time, and pull back--

2126
02:40:05,099 --> 02:40:11,618
LIAM: 22 points, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I usually
throw daggers, I usually don't get up on people.

2127
02:40:11,618 --> 02:40:17,256
MATT: I know. It's all good. So as you jam the
second blade in and pull back, he lets you draw

2128
02:40:17,256 --> 02:40:22,863
the blade, and a grin now curls back. At which
point you watch as the wound that was blasted in

2129
02:40:22,863 --> 02:40:28,275
the shoulder pulses and you can see the gunshot
wound suddenly causes some of the more bones in

2130
02:40:28,275 --> 02:40:33,172
the clavicle area that are now exposed from the
impact crack leftover the hemorrhaging shot from

2131
02:40:33,172 --> 02:40:44,896
Percival earlier. And he's like, (grumble)
"Hello." You can smell this wave of decay and as it

2132
02:40:44,896 --> 02:40:50,962
brushes past you, you can actually feel this weird
crawling sensation like the air itself is

2133
02:40:50,962 --> 02:40:54,618
beginning to pull at your flesh. And that's your
turn.

2134
02:40:54,618 --> 02:40:55,928
LIAM: Yes.

2135
02:40:55,928 --> 02:41:02,288
MATT: All right. He is going to--

2136
02:41:02,288 --> 02:41:08,222
LIAM: Buy me a beer.

2137
02:41:08,222 --> 02:41:13,106
LAURA: How do we get Grog up there?

2138
02:41:13,106 --> 02:41:17,743
SAM: There's a plan.

2139
02:41:17,743 --> 02:41:19,856
LAURA: Okay. Sorry, I'm sorry. Freaking out.

2140
02:41:19,856 --> 02:41:24,087
SAM: Percy's building a ladder.

2141
02:41:24,087 --> 02:41:29,483
TALIESIN: Keep him distracted.

2142
02:41:29,483 --> 02:41:33,518
SAM: All he needs is a wood shop and about 25
minutes.

2143
02:41:33,518 --> 02:41:36,441
MATT: Vecna's going to use his last two legendary
actions as you stab in the face.

2144
02:41:36,441 --> 02:41:38,287
LIAM: Uh-huh. Here it is.

2145
02:41:38,287 --> 02:41:41,726
MATT: As his hand comes up in front, the hand
which now the long skeletal fingers unwind to be

2146
02:41:41,726 --> 02:41:48,186
larger than the full of your entire body and
almost your wingspan, it's almost like the fingers

2147
02:41:48,186 --> 02:42:02,709
expand longer than they should, and he says,
"Goodnight, Bitch's prince." And there's like a

2148
02:42:02,709 --> 02:42:04,720
flash of dark and you see this wave of cold
necrotic energy come to you. I need you to go

2149
02:42:04,720 --> 02:42:08,394
ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.

2150
02:42:08,394 --> 02:42:13,402
LIAM: Okay. I'm above 100. So I have no idea if
that has anything to do with what's going on here.

2151
02:42:13,402 --> 02:42:15,130
MATT: No.

2152
02:42:15,334 --> 02:42:17,295
SAM: Oh no. It's something else.

2153
02:42:17,295 --> 02:42:21,619
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. It was a good roll,
but I'm going to use Luck.

2154
02:42:21,619 --> 02:42:23,139
SAM. Yeah.

2155
02:42:23,139 --> 02:42:25,564
LAURA: Do you have to take it if you use Luck?

2156
02:42:25,564 --> 02:42:26,828
LIAM: No.

2157
02:42:26,828 --> 02:42:27,817
LAURA: Okay.

2158
02:42:27,817 --> 02:42:29,169
LIAM: Con save?

2159
02:42:29,169 --> 02:42:30,121
MATT: Yep.

2160
02:42:30,121 --> 02:42:31,815
LIAM: 24.

2161
02:42:31,815 --> 02:42:35,755
MATT: 24 does not succeed. I'm sorry. You
suffer--

2162
02:42:35,755 --> 02:42:38,532
LIAM: I've got the necrotic armor on.

2163
02:42:38,532 --> 02:42:43,404
MATT: However, unfortunately, the wave of energy
that expanded last round, 20 count, negated that,

2164
02:42:43,404 --> 02:42:45,735
so you take 36 points of necrotic damage.

2165
02:42:45,735 --> 02:42:46,793
LIAM: Okay.

2166
02:42:46,793 --> 02:42:48,077
MATT: From Circle of Death.

2167
02:42:48,077 --> 02:42:49,505
LAURA: Circle of Death?

2168
02:42:49,505 --> 02:42:57,257
MATT: Oh, sorry, it should've been an extra d6 on
that. So add three to that, because there's 2d6

2169
02:42:57,257 --> 02:42:58,501
every additional spell level.

2170
02:42:58,501 --> 02:43:00,124
LIAM: That's fair.

2171
02:43:00,124 --> 02:43:02,512
TALIESIN: He's out of legendaries.

2172
02:43:02,512 --> 02:43:16,518
MATT: That brings us to the 20 initiative count.
J'mon, desperately trying, does not have the

2173
02:43:16,518 --> 02:43:20,960
spellcasting prowess of other dragons you've
encountered and begins to thrust their body side

2174
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:25,990
to side against the Forcecage, unable to escape,
roaring angrily within the confines of the spell,

2175
02:43:25,990 --> 02:43:32,228
as it clusters in the entirety of this majestic
dragon's form into this small box held aloft in

2176
02:43:32,228 --> 02:43:38,231
this space to the side of the ruined tower. At
this point in time, you see as the spiraling

2177
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:43,141
cyclone around you is whirling, and you hear
screeches in the distance, and you watch as flying

2178
02:43:43,141 --> 02:43:50,994
creatures, four of them, begin to emerge from the
sides of it. You see from the back two heavily

2179
02:43:50,994 --> 02:43:59,234
wounded gloomstalkers giving chase to two wyverns
that are damaged in their own right. Flying in, on

2180
02:43:59,234 --> 02:44:04,217
the back there are two soldiers coming in. As the
darkness begins to fade past, you can see the red

2181
02:44:04,217 --> 02:44:09,996
skin and dark horns, the white hair of Zahra,
riding on the side of this wyvern, and behind her,

2182
02:44:09,996 --> 02:44:12,333
Kashaw, riding in as well.

2183
02:44:12,333 --> 02:44:21,297
(yelling)

2184
02:44:21,297 --> 02:44:31,396
ALL: Holy shit! Oh my god! What the hell!

2185
02:44:31,396 --> 02:44:33,014
LIAM: Ah! This guy!

2186
02:44:33,014 --> 02:44:53,810
(yelling)

2187
02:44:53,810 --> 02:44:56,320
SAM: We saw you die!

2188
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:58,902
WILL: Never believe it.

2189
02:44:58,902 --> 02:45:09,549
MATT: You do see, as they swarm in, the two other
gloomstalkers close behind. Both of them appear,

2190
02:45:09,549 --> 02:45:13,817
at first glance, they themselves are scratched.
You see bloodied in the faces. They've been

2191
02:45:13,817 --> 02:45:17,379
through an onslaught to even break through to the
top of the tower. As you see them ride into the

2192
02:45:17,379 --> 02:45:23,881
brief but crackling light from the surrounding
magical aura of the tower, you have seemingly a

2193
02:45:23,881 --> 02:45:27,355
cavalry at hand. So what would you guys like to
do?

2194
02:45:27,355 --> 02:45:29,862
WILL: My love?

2195
02:45:29,862 --> 02:45:35,670
MARY: Hello, darling. You've got a little blood all
over you. It's all right.

2196
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:37,557
WILL: You look like shit!

2197
02:45:37,557 --> 02:45:42,013
MARY: Thank you, darling. Oh my god.

2198
02:45:42,013 --> 02:45:46,197
MARISHA: He's beauty pageant crying.

2199
02:45:46,289 --> 02:45:49,381
MARY: Is there anybody fallen in this, my
darling?

2200
02:45:49,381 --> 02:45:56,850
MATT: You hear (screeching) behind you. Two of the
gloomstalkers that have been chasing you have also

2201
02:45:56,850 --> 02:45:58,778
pushed through the cyclone, seemingly
unaffected by its torrent.

2202
02:45:58,874 --> 02:46:06,534
WILL: Yeah, we're being followed. Where are we in
relation to everybody?

2203
02:46:06,534 --> 02:46:12,337
MATT: You guys are right here. Your full move was
to get to that edge of the tower, and right now

2204
02:46:12,337 --> 02:46:14,469
you each have an action. What are you going to
do?

2205
02:46:14,469 --> 02:46:22,486
MARY: How far up is he from us?

2206
02:46:22,486 --> 02:46:26,201
MATT: From each of you, he would be about 55 feet.

2207
02:46:26,201 --> 02:46:29,264
SAM: Put on the hurt.

2208
02:46:29,264 --> 02:46:33,304
MARISHA: That's you! That's fucking you!

2209
02:46:33,304 --> 02:46:35,677
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

2210
02:46:35,677 --> 02:46:54,975
MARY: I'm going in, my love. I fly up within
range. I raise my hand, I target his eye, and I

2211
02:46:54,975 --> 02:47:00,633
cast, or I try, Finger of Death.

2212
02:47:00,633 --> 02:47:02,404
SAM: Yeah!

2213
02:47:02,404 --> 02:47:14,684
MATT: All right, so. He has to make a constitution
saving throw. That is a 17.

2214
02:47:14,684 --> 02:47:15,903
MARY: No.

2215
02:47:15,903 --> 02:47:24,180
MATT: So he takes 7d8 plus 30 necrotic damage. So
go ahead and roll 7d8.

2216
02:47:24,180 --> 02:47:27,521
TALIESIN: You can use mine. Whatever you need. I
only have a couple.

2217
02:47:27,521 --> 02:47:29,145
MARISHA: Here's some too.

2218
02:47:29,145 --> 02:47:36,828
MARY: Eight plus five is 13. How many do I roll?
Seven. Oh shit.

2219
02:47:36,828 --> 02:47:40,297
SAM: You're up to 20. You're at 32.

2220
02:47:40,297 --> 02:47:46,619
MARY: And one more? 38 plus 30 is 68.

2221
02:47:46,619 --> 02:47:52,863
MATT: 68 points of necrotic damage. Halved,
because he is resistant to necrotic damage. 34

2222
02:47:52,863 --> 02:47:59,411
points of necrotic damage. As you reach up, you
watch as the beam of sickly green energy slams

2223
02:47:59,411 --> 02:48:03,776
into the back of Vecna as he's spun around. You
saw the eye for a second but in the flurry of

2224
02:48:03,776 --> 02:48:07,799
realizing you're there, he spins and it manages to
catch him in the back of the shoulder. "Oh, how

2225
02:48:07,799 --> 02:48:11,767
"quaint. I learned that when I was but a child."

2226
02:48:11,767 --> 02:48:18,377
MARY: Oh, did you! Well it's time to put aside
childish things, semi-god.

2227
02:48:18,377 --> 02:48:21,893
MATT: What are you doing, Kashaw?

2228
02:48:21,893 --> 02:48:30,973
WILL: First of all, I'm going, Fuck yeah, baby! So
is there anybody directly around Vecna right now?

2229
02:48:30,973 --> 02:48:33,229
You're on his face?

2230
02:48:33,229 --> 02:48:35,666
MATT: Yeah, Vax is flying up in his face right
now.

2231
02:48:35,666 --> 02:48:37,387
WILL: Makes things more difficult.

2232
02:48:37,387 --> 02:48:38,548
LIAM: Could you aim for his penis?

2233
02:48:38,548 --> 02:48:46,559
WILL: I could, but why? It's so pretty. I think
I'm going to do what I can first.

2234
02:48:46,559 --> 02:48:48,744
MARISHA: How many penises have you seen?

2235
02:48:48,744 --> 02:48:52,493
WILL: Well different story. I think I'd like to
fly down and get closer to everybody.

2236
02:48:52,493 --> 02:48:57,456
MATT: It took your full movement to get to this
spot, so you have your action for the turn.

2237
02:48:57,456 --> 02:49:00,107
WILL: Who is in range for a good Mass Cure Wounds?
Is there anybody?

2238
02:49:00,107 --> 02:49:05,239
MATT: Within your current range, you have
Percival, Grog, and-- what's the range on it?

2239
02:49:05,239 --> 02:49:11,109
WILL: It is, to Mass Cure, is 30-foot radius.

2240
02:49:11,109 --> 02:49:14,110
LIAM: And you're on that side.

2241
02:49:14,110 --> 02:49:19,825
LAURA: But Mass Cure, you can choose a point. Mass
Cure Wounds, you can choose any 30-foot sphere

2242
02:49:19,825 --> 02:49:21,719
within 60 feet of you.

2243
02:49:21,719 --> 02:49:29,089
MATT: So with that, you can hit either Grog,
Percy, and Scanlan, or Vex, Grog, and Scanlan.

2244
02:49:29,089 --> 02:49:35,432
WILL: Well Scanlan, I know, needs some help, so I
think we're going to definitely do Percy, Grog,

2245
02:49:35,432 --> 02:49:37,448
and Scanlan, then, if those are the guys that need
it the most.

2246
02:49:37,448 --> 02:49:41,807
LAURA: Yeah, because you don't see me because I'm
hidden on the other side.

2247
02:49:41,807 --> 02:49:45,493
WILL: I'm going to also, for the record, I'm going
to do it as a 6th-level spell, so it's going to be

2248
02:49:45,493 --> 02:49:50,466
4d8 instead. These are the eights, correct?
Testify, my friend.

2249
02:49:50,466 --> 02:49:56,255
SAM: Matt, our young lady over here would like to
bonus action something.

2250
02:49:56,255 --> 02:49:57,857
MARY: If I'm too late-- Can I Hex him?

2251
02:49:57,857 --> 02:49:59,041
MATT: You can. Double hex.

2252
02:49:59,041 --> 02:50:00,781
SAM: Oh, double hex? He's already hexed?

2253
02:50:00,781 --> 02:50:02,677
TALIESIN: I have him hexed.

2254
02:50:02,677 --> 02:50:05,107
SAM: All right, double hexed.

2255
02:50:05,107 --> 02:50:10,195
MATT: By the way, I need you to make a
concentration check because you did take a

2256
02:50:10,195 --> 02:50:11,440
shit-ton of damage.

2257
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:14,624
TALIESIN: I took, how much damage did I take?

2258
02:50:14,624 --> 02:50:18,372
MATT: It would've been, because you took half of
it, so it would've been 60-- So you have to beat a

2259
02:50:18,372 --> 02:50:20,192
33.

2260
02:50:20,192 --> 02:50:21,719
TALIESIN: What is the saving throw?

2261
02:50:21,719 --> 02:50:23,315
MATT: Constitution.

2262
02:50:23,315 --> 02:50:25,894
TALIESIN: I can't, so that's fine. Mine's gone.

2263
02:50:25,894 --> 02:50:27,405
SAM: And yours is up.

2264
02:50:27,405 --> 02:50:30,905
TALIESIN: It is not a 20.

2265
02:50:30,905 --> 02:50:34,361
MATT: All right, so yeah. So your Hex is gone, but
Zahra's Hex is up.

2266
02:50:34,361 --> 02:50:36,362
WILL: You guys get 20.

2267
02:50:36,362 --> 02:50:42,143
MATT: 20 hit points to Scanlan, Grog, and
Percival. All right, anything with your bonus

2268
02:50:42,143 --> 02:50:43,390
action, or you good?

2269
02:50:43,390 --> 02:50:47,206
WILL: Can I get away with my bonus action? I used
my entire movement to get there, didn't I? So no.

2270
02:50:47,206 --> 02:50:54,175
MATT: That ends your turn. All right, also, at
this point, the stones begin to shift. You watch

2271
02:50:54,175 --> 02:50:58,911
as the tether that holds the various columns
begins to separate and then begin to rotate.

2272
02:50:58,911 --> 02:51:00,278
SAM: Wait, what?

2273
02:51:00,278 --> 02:51:07,654
MATT: So this island begins to move. This tower
begins to separate to there. This begins to push

2274
02:51:07,654 --> 02:51:10,146
away.

2275
02:51:10,146 --> 02:51:16,383
SAM: We're getting farther apart?

2276
02:51:16,383 --> 02:51:17,557
LAURA: Fuck.

2277
02:51:17,557 --> 02:51:19,452
TALIESIN: None of us are on these platforms,
though. Those are all skeletons.

2278
02:51:19,452 --> 02:51:20,833
MARISHA: I'm a flyer, so I'm good.

2279
02:51:20,833 --> 02:51:25,775
LAURA: I'm hidden on the other side of the wall,
so would I have been sitting there on my broom,

2280
02:51:25,775 --> 02:51:28,384
like, as the wall has shifted away from me?

2281
02:51:28,384 --> 02:51:30,172
MATT: Yeah, shifted outward like: "Ah, what?"

2282
02:51:30,172 --> 02:51:31,561
LAURA: Zahra! Hi!

2283
02:51:31,561 --> 02:51:39,688
MARISHA: She's distracted. She's like (yells)
right now.

2284
02:51:39,688 --> 02:51:43,308
LAURA: There's shit going on, she wouldn't even
have noticed me.

2285
02:51:43,308 --> 02:51:44,981
MARY: My darling! Hello!

2286
02:51:44,981 --> 02:51:46,167
LAURA: Hi!

2287
02:51:46,167 --> 02:51:47,420
MARY: I love your hat!

2288
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:53,936
LAURA: Oh, thank you! It's very hot, but I'm going
to put it on for a second because she complimented it!

2289
02:51:53,936 --> 02:52:04,107
MARISHA: Okay, in my buff Michael Fassbender, but
as a hot chick kind of way, I look down and I go:

2290
02:52:04,107 --> 02:52:11,271
Grog! The gymnast thing! Whoosh. And I swoop down,
my speed.

2291
02:52:11,271 --> 02:52:13,842
MATT: Toward Grog?

2292
02:52:13,842 --> 02:52:19,239
MARISHA: But I'm buff, and I'm bigger!

2293
02:52:19,239 --> 02:52:26,180
MATT: I'd say you need about 50 feet to get to
Grog. 50 feet of your movement, you get down to

2294
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:27,984
where Grog is. What are you doing?

2295
02:52:27,984 --> 02:52:30,893
MARISHA: I'm going to scoop him up if he can do a
little jump and whoosh.

2296
02:52:30,893 --> 02:52:32,849
MATT: What's the strength of your planetar?

2297
02:52:32,849 --> 02:52:34,828
MARISHA: 24 strength.

2298
02:52:34,828 --> 02:52:42,730
MATT: Yeah, you could, yeah. You could probably do
that. Roll a strength check for me, if you don't mind.

2299
02:52:42,730 --> 02:52:48,882
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine. I rolled a nine plus
seven, so 16.

2300
02:52:48,882 --> 02:52:54,062
MATT: So you swoop down, arm underneath Grog's
shoulders. It's your action do that, I'll say.

2301
02:52:54,062 --> 02:52:55,880
Grab and get hold, and then--?

2302
02:52:55,880 --> 02:53:01,872
MARISHA: Going the rest of my movement, which you
said I used 40 feet? 50? So I have another 70

2303
02:53:01,872 --> 02:53:09,532
feet of movement.

2304
02:53:09,532 --> 02:53:11,138
MATT: You get him about there.

2305
02:53:11,138 --> 02:53:12,852
MARISHA: Can I use my bonus to dash a little
further?

2306
02:53:12,852 --> 02:53:14,946
MATT: I don't think you have a bonus to dash,
unfortunately.

2307
02:53:14,946 --> 02:53:22,492
MARISHA: Can I, because you held your action. Can
I get up there and give him the cheerleader, like

2308
02:53:22,492 --> 02:53:28,299
the figure skater, Go, Grog! And see if I can do
the, you know?

2309
02:53:28,299 --> 02:53:31,836
MATT: You've already used your action,
unfortunately. That would be an action to try and

2310
02:53:31,836 --> 02:53:33,250
do that.

2311
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:37,360
LAURA: Oh that's true, he does have a chain
weapon.

2312
02:53:37,360 --> 02:53:42,375
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

2313
02:53:42,375 --> 02:53:44,028
SAM: God, so many levels.

2314
02:53:44,028 --> 02:53:50,168
MATT: I know, this is kind of crazy. You guys are
about ten feet below.

2315
02:53:50,168 --> 02:53:59,508
MARISHA: What's the reach on your thing? Can I
have him on my shoulder, you know, once again like

2316
02:53:59,508 --> 02:54:02,665
the cheerleader thing? Ready, go! Okay!

2317
02:54:02,665 --> 02:54:07,520
LAURA: Can you do anything?

2318
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:18,161
TRAVIS: Not as much as I wanted to do, but I'm not
going to get any closer this round. I'm going to

2319
02:54:18,161 --> 02:54:19,697
use that action to--

2320
02:54:19,697 --> 02:54:22,169
MARISHA: Can you use your chain as a grappling
hook?

2321
02:54:22,169 --> 02:54:38,189
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm going to take a note from
Zahra, and I'm going to, with the Sword of Kas,

2322
02:54:38,189 --> 02:54:39,873
cast Finger of Death.

2323
02:54:39,873 --> 02:54:40,922
SAM: Oh!

2324
02:54:40,922 --> 02:54:42,831
WILL: Wow!

2325
02:54:42,831 --> 02:54:44,302
TRAVIS: Is that an attack action?

2326
02:54:44,302 --> 02:54:47,892
MATT: No, it's casting a spell, so you'd have to
say you were holding that.

2327
02:54:47,892 --> 02:54:50,714
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll attach the Chain of Returning,
then, and throw the sword.

2328
02:54:50,714 --> 02:54:56,165
MATT: Okay, so as you're pulled up and you're just
out of range, you see the wings beginning to

2329
02:54:56,165 --> 02:54:59,207
falter at the end of the round. You lob the sword
up. As you're preparing it once again, the sword's

2330
02:54:59,207 --> 02:55:04,453
voice pulses into your ears. "Kill him, take him,
throw me!"

2331
02:55:04,453 --> 02:55:07,456
TRAVIS: Just out of curiosity, you can't fly or
anything, can you?

2332
02:55:07,456 --> 02:55:12,997
MATT: "No! Hurry!"

2333
02:55:12,997 --> 02:55:16,956
TRAVIS: All right. That is a 31.

2334
02:55:16,956 --> 02:55:18,209
MATT: 31 hits.

2335
02:55:18,209 --> 02:55:21,388
TRAVIS: Yes, okay.

2336
02:55:21,388 --> 02:55:22,539
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2337
02:55:22,539 --> 02:55:27,275
TRAVIS: Oh, nice! Ten, so 26--

2338
02:55:27,275 --> 02:55:30,305
LIAM: We love you, Ashley.

2339
02:55:30,305 --> 02:55:32,441
ASHLEY: I love you guys.

2340
02:55:32,441 --> 02:55:45,012
TRAVIS: 35, 39, 43. 43.

2341
02:55:45,012 --> 02:55:46,556
MATT: 43, whew.

2342
02:55:46,556 --> 02:55:48,052
ASHLEY: That's my boy, Grog!

2343
02:55:48,052 --> 02:55:53,175
MATT: Okay. So as you swing the Sword of Kas
upward, it lodges right into the side of the

2344
02:55:53,175 --> 02:55:59,220
ribcage and up into the spinal column where this
little bits of hanging, mummified flesh. You watch

2345
02:55:59,220 --> 02:56:08,031
as a flash of energy hits in a blast of necrotic,
angry dark energy. The sword immediately says, in

2346
02:56:08,031 --> 02:56:14,524
the back of your mind, "Yes!" as Vecna (sounds of
pain). Grasps the blade on the other end, where

2347
02:56:14,524 --> 02:56:21,735
it's jammed through, and looks down at you. You
can see this point of grin, of, "You're going to

2348
02:56:21,735 --> 02:56:32,248
"continue to be a problem, won't you?" So the sword
is embedded in his body. You do see, where it's

2349
02:56:32,248 --> 02:56:40,609
embedded, a secondary spark of that glowing light
is beginning to emerge.

2350
02:56:40,609 --> 02:56:42,104
LAURA: That's good.

2351
02:56:42,104 --> 02:56:44,370
TRAVIS: It's a bonus action to pull it out, but I
don't have one.

2352
02:56:44,370 --> 02:56:47,179
MATT: You don't, no. It's just in there.

2353
02:56:47,179 --> 02:56:50,032
TRAVIS: Got a stuck Vecna. All right!

2354
02:56:50,032 --> 02:56:53,274
MATT: Keyleth, end of your turn? All right.
Percival, you're up.

2355
02:56:53,274 --> 02:56:59,848
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot at one of those
nasties that have followed them through, since

2356
02:56:59,848 --> 02:57:12,013
that seems to be a good use of my energy right
now. First shot is a 29 to hit.

2357
02:57:12,013 --> 02:57:15,651
MATT: 29 to hit? Okay, that hits. Go ahead and
roll damage.

2358
02:57:15,651 --> 02:57:20,228
TALIESIN: I'm going to, just for fun, drop two
Cabal's Ruin in there, for my own amusement.

2359
02:57:20,228 --> 02:57:25,435
MATT: I get a sinking sense that Bones of the
Earth isn't going to happen?

2360
02:57:25,435 --> 02:57:27,431
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

2361
02:57:27,431 --> 02:57:31,480
MATT: However! If anyone wants some really cool
stone pillars--

2362
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:37,291
MARISHA: It changed! The battlefield changed
immediately.

2363
02:57:37,291 --> 02:57:40,352
MATT: Easy to make with a dowel and a Dremel,
guys. Recommend it. It's great.

2364
02:57:40,352 --> 02:57:45,317
TALIESIN: Aw, now I feel bad. 15 points of damage,
two points of psychic, and six points of lightning

2365
02:57:45,317 --> 02:57:48,920
damage to shadowy jerk number one.

2366
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:54,553
MATT: Okay, as it's flying (screeching). It looks
heavily damaged. It's taken some hits in the fray,

2367
02:57:54,553 --> 02:57:59,436
but it's still standing. It's still flapping its
wings. It now seems to be noticing all the new

2368
02:57:59,436 --> 02:58:03,943
targets on the battlefield, beyond the ones it
was-- Okay, go for it.

2369
02:58:03,943 --> 02:58:07,747
TALIESIN: I'm shoot it again. I'm going to drop a
grit for advantage.

2370
02:58:07,747 --> 02:58:14,114
TRAVIS: Kim Kardashian's fantasy wedding cake
here.

2371
02:58:14,114 --> 02:58:16,878
MATT: Strangely enough, that's the name for the
battlefield tonight.

2372
02:58:16,878 --> 02:58:23,153
TALIESIN: 27 to hit. I'm not going to drop
anything into it, I'm just going to hit him.

2373
02:58:23,153 --> 02:58:27,776
That's nine points of damage plus two psychic
damage.

2374
02:58:27,776 --> 02:58:32,977
MATT: Okay. Hits him, You can see the drops of its
internal fluids dropping out, but it's still

2375
02:58:32,977 --> 02:58:34,600
standing there.

2376
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:44,934
TALIESIN: Oh, fine. Then I'm going to target the
other one with another grit for advantage. That's

2377
02:58:44,934 --> 02:58:50,650
cocked. Feels bad, I liked that roll.

2378
02:58:50,650 --> 02:58:53,328
MARISHA: Is that the same roll?

2379
02:58:53,328 --> 02:59:01,348
TALIESIN: Yeah, same roll. (counting) 24.

2380
02:59:01,348 --> 02:59:02,348
MATT: That hits.

2381
02:59:02,348 --> 02:59:09,601
TALIESIN: All right, and I'm going to drop one,
two, three, four, five points of Cabal's Ruin into

2382
02:59:09,601 --> 02:59:21,386
that one. Drop, motherfucker. Three, four, five.

2383
02:59:21,386 --> 02:59:23,472
MARISHA: Drop it like it's hot.

2384
02:59:23,472 --> 02:59:32,764
TALIESIN: That's ten, 18 points of lightning
damage. 13 points of piercing damage, and six

2385
02:59:32,764 --> 02:59:34,663
points of psychic damage.

2386
02:59:34,663 --> 02:59:36,643
LAURA: Okay, this hat is so hot!

2387
02:59:36,643 --> 02:59:41,733
MATT: The other one (explosion) shoots, blasts,
and you see the lightning arcing across its body,

2388
02:59:41,733 --> 02:59:45,754
lighting up the outside of its normally almost
nightmare-black flesh. The smoke dissipates and

2389
02:59:45,754 --> 02:59:50,346
you can see blood dripping from its form, black,
and disappearing into the sky beneath you, the

2390
02:59:50,346 --> 02:59:56,207
wind from the cyclone whipping it out of sight.
Still flying in space, though. They're both

2391
02:59:56,207 --> 02:59:59,115
heavily wounded, but they're still there.

2392
02:59:59,115 --> 03:00:07,260
TALIESIN: Fuck's sake. That's everything I've got
right now. I'm going to try and scoot around the--

2393
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:12,496
I'm going to get a little further back so I can
grab onto that orb if things go shitty.

2394
03:00:12,496 --> 03:00:14,550
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2395
03:00:14,550 --> 03:00:16,861
MARISHA: If we straight kill him, that's no good?

2396
03:00:16,861 --> 03:00:22,656
TALIESIN: No, he won't die. You've got to trammel
him. You can't kill him.

2397
03:00:22,656 --> 03:00:25,761
MATT: You don't know what would happen.

2398
03:00:25,761 --> 03:00:27,622
TRAVIS: It's quite clear we know nothing.

2399
03:00:27,622 --> 03:00:36,724
SAM: Wand of Fireballs can get him, right?

2400
03:00:36,724 --> 03:00:41,489
MATT: The range on Fireball? It's a pretty long
range, I'm pretty sure.

2401
03:00:41,489 --> 03:00:45,073
TALIESIN: Although you can probably hit him with
it and not hit Vax.

2402
03:00:45,073 --> 03:00:46,931
SAM: I could hit above him.

2403
03:00:46,931 --> 03:00:54,674
MATT: Fireball, 150 feet. Yeah, you could totally
hit him with it. You're still prone on the ground,

2404
03:00:54,674 --> 03:00:55,786
by the way.

2405
03:00:55,786 --> 03:00:56,797
SAM: I will stand up.

2406
03:00:56,797 --> 03:00:59,540
MATT: Okay, you still have about 15, ten feet of
movement.

2407
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:00,769
SAM: Who's near me?

2408
03:01:00,769 --> 03:01:05,611
MATT: Vex is behind you, Percy's to the front and
the right of you. Pike's above you.

2409
03:01:05,611 --> 03:01:10,267
SAM: Is Pike within inspiring range, or--? Oh
wait, actually--

2410
03:01:10,267 --> 03:01:18,109
MATT: Might be, yeah. Any of them would, including
Grog and Keyleth. Actually no, because he's up

2411
03:01:18,109 --> 03:01:25,593
here, he's out of range. I'm sorry, my bad, I
forgot. He's right there. I'm like, this will be

2412
03:01:25,593 --> 03:01:31,624
enough platforms! How can that possibly not be
enough platforms? Lesson learned.

2413
03:01:31,624 --> 03:01:36,382
SAM: I'll use five of my seven Fireball charges.

2414
03:01:36,382 --> 03:01:41,200
MATT: Five of your seven Fireball charges? Puts it
at a level what?

2415
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:49,572
SAM: Well it starts at three, and that uses one
charge. So four, five, six, seven.

2416
03:01:49,572 --> 03:01:57,408
MATT: Okay, so 7th-level Fireball. Dexterity
saving throw from him. That is a 21.

2417
03:01:57,408 --> 03:02:01,882
SAM: Is that my spellcasting--? No, it's a DC 15.
It saves.

2418
03:02:01,882 --> 03:02:04,265
MATT: So roll damage, and he takes half.

2419
03:02:04,265 --> 03:02:31,888
SAM: Shit, and it's 8d6, 9d6, 10d6, 11d6, 12d6!
But halved. Okay, 14, 25, that was good. 40.

2420
03:02:31,888 --> 03:02:34,572
MATT: 40, okay. So he takes 20 points of fire
damage.

2421
03:02:34,572 --> 03:02:46,843
SAM: Yep, and I'll call out, I need a lift! I will
bonus action 2nd-level Healing Words myself.

2422
03:02:46,843 --> 03:02:48,352
MATT: Okay.

2423
03:02:48,352 --> 03:02:58,970
SAM: Oh, terrible. Okay, so I get another ten
points.

2424
03:02:58,970 --> 03:03:02,860
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

2425
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:05,001
ALL: Okay, okay, okay!

2426
03:03:05,001 --> 03:03:06,459
SAM: That's it!

2427
03:03:06,459 --> 03:03:08,914
MATT: All righty. Pike, you're up.

2428
03:03:08,914 --> 03:03:21,117
ASHLEY: Okay. Is there somewhere I can get where I
can be within 60 feet range of everybody? In a

2429
03:03:21,117 --> 03:03:22,825
middle spot?

2430
03:03:22,825 --> 03:03:26,482
LAURA: You're pretty close to being that.

2431
03:03:26,482 --> 03:03:30,906
MATT: Yeah, actually, you're not that far from it.
If you move over to here, about this space, you

2432
03:03:30,906 --> 03:03:33,343
could probably get within 60 feet of everybody,
yeah.

2433
03:03:33,343 --> 03:03:35,774
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to do it!

2434
03:03:35,774 --> 03:03:37,214
LAURA: What are you doing?

2435
03:03:37,214 --> 03:03:45,972
ASHLEY: It's time for Mass Heal, which is 700 hit
points spread out.

2436
03:03:45,972 --> 03:03:57,339
MATT: Vecna is going to use his reaction blowing
a, let's see.

2437
03:03:57,339 --> 03:03:59,281
LAURA: Such a dick move.

2438
03:03:59,281 --> 03:04:04,241
TRAVIS: He's used all of his legendary actions.

2439
03:04:04,241 --> 03:04:08,331
TALIESIN: He has one last legendary resistance.

2440
03:04:08,331 --> 03:04:14,472
MATT: All right, so what's the spell level on
that?

2441
03:04:14,472 --> 03:04:16,297
ASHLEY: Nine.

2442
03:04:16,297 --> 03:04:25,192
MATT: 9th-level spell? All right, so it's a DC of
19. He has to roll an ability check using your

2443
03:04:25,192 --> 03:04:26,850
spellcasting ability, which is ten, so--

2444
03:04:26,850 --> 03:04:28,644
SAM: I can't Counterspell his Counterspell?

2445
03:04:28,644 --> 03:04:30,659
MATT: You're too far away from him.

2446
03:04:30,659 --> 03:04:33,466
SAM: But I'm not too far away from her? But that's
not how it works, okay.

2447
03:04:33,466 --> 03:04:35,945
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage because he's
currently under Hex.

2448
03:04:35,945 --> 03:04:41,264
MATT: That's true. So 17. Natural 17, plus ten. So
27.

2449
03:04:41,264 --> 03:04:43,079
MARISHA: That's not good.

2450
03:04:43,079 --> 03:04:50,715
MATT: (sighs) Seven plus ten, that's 17. It's a
9th-level spell. He needed to roll a 19 or higher,

2451
03:04:50,715 --> 03:04:52,067
so he fails--

2452
03:04:52,067 --> 03:04:54,816
(cheering)

2453
03:04:54,816 --> 03:04:56,397
MARY: Hex wins again!

2454
03:04:56,397 --> 03:04:59,104
MATT: Well that was-- your hex was gone?

2455
03:04:59,104 --> 03:05:00,253
TALIESIN: No, it was your hex.

2456
03:05:00,253 --> 03:05:01,316
MARY: It was my hex.

2457
03:05:01,316 --> 03:05:02,741
MATT: And you said intelligence on that one, too?

2458
03:05:02,741 --> 03:05:03,589
MARY: Pardon me?

2459
03:05:03,589 --> 03:05:05,254
TALIESIN and LIAM: Yeah.

2460
03:05:05,254 --> 03:05:09,157
MATT: Okay. Because you called Hex. Sure.

2461
03:05:09,157 --> 03:05:15,987
LIAM: Question. I'm probably out of range. Am I in
or out of range, by his face? Probably just out?

2462
03:05:15,987 --> 03:05:21,062
MATT: Because you attacked physically, in melee,
you're right in his face.

2463
03:05:21,062 --> 03:05:24,400
LIAM: Close to Pike-- am I 60 feet?

2464
03:05:24,400 --> 03:05:28,174
MATT: Oh. Yeah, I'll say so.

2465
03:05:28,174 --> 03:05:30,796
SAM: All right, Pike, divvy it up.

2466
03:05:30,796 --> 03:05:35,725
ASHLEY: Okay, so. Zahra and Kashaw, I love you
both--

2467
03:05:35,725 --> 03:05:37,160
MARY: We don't need any, darling. We're fine.

2468
03:05:37,160 --> 03:05:40,512
ASHLEY: Okay. But I'm going to give-- all of us
get 100 apiece.

2469
03:05:40,512 --> 03:05:43,757
(cheering)

2470
03:05:43,757 --> 03:05:45,096
WILL: Good for you guys.

2471
03:05:45,096 --> 03:05:47,162
ASHLEY: You get a hundred, and you get a hundred!

2472
03:05:47,162 --> 03:05:52,050
LAURA: Wait, Pike, I don't need that much! I only
need like 20.

2473
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:53,760
LIAM: Does she get to choose?

2474
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:57,193
MATT: She gets to divvy up the hit points however
she wants.

2475
03:05:57,193 --> 03:06:01,510
LIAM: Vax is doing real well. The temporary hit
points don't come back, right? Yeah, Vax is doing

2476
03:06:01,510 --> 03:06:03,821
real well. I'll take a skosh, a peppering.

2477
03:06:03,821 --> 03:06:05,049
ASHLEY: Just a skosh?

2478
03:06:05,049 --> 03:06:06,654
LAURA: I need 20 hit points.

2479
03:06:06,654 --> 03:06:07,978
TRAVIS: And I only need 66.

2480
03:06:07,978 --> 03:06:11,244
MARISHA: I need a full 100, what about
you?

2481
03:06:11,244 --> 03:06:14,733
SAM: I need more than a hundred.

2482
03:06:14,816 --> 03:06:19,450
MARISHA: And you need more than a hundred. But she
has plenty left over. Percy and Sam need more than

2483
03:06:19,450 --> 03:06:20,589
a hundred.

2484
03:06:20,589 --> 03:06:23,544
SAM: How does this work, Matt? Does she know all
this inherently?

2485
03:06:23,544 --> 03:06:25,199
LIAM: She can see how fucked up we are.

2486
03:06:25,199 --> 03:06:31,020
LAURA: So good, you have enough for everybody to
get back to max. So that's the thing, everybody's

2487
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:32,495
back at max.

2488
03:06:32,495 --> 03:06:37,185
LIAM: None of the temporary hit points, but your
regular max.

2489
03:06:37,185 --> 03:06:40,114
LAURA: Plus the two for the feast, so.

2490
03:06:40,114 --> 03:06:44,197
TALIESIN: Yeah, your max plus two.

2491
03:06:44,197 --> 03:06:47,189
SAM: And Vecna's also back to full. Right?

2492
03:06:47,189 --> 03:06:49,669
MATT: (laughter) Everybody!

2493
03:06:49,669 --> 03:06:52,775
SAM: She's really nice.

2494
03:06:52,775 --> 03:06:59,685
MATT: All right, so everybody's at full hit
points.

2495
03:06:59,685 --> 03:07:03,127
TRAVIS: What a fucking boss.

2496
03:07:03,127 --> 03:07:06,477
LIAM: Love your healers, folks.

2497
03:07:06,477 --> 03:07:10,447
WILL: Hug a cleric today!

2498
03:07:10,447 --> 03:07:18,786
MARY: I can see the steam rising from Matt's
head.

2499
03:07:18,786 --> 03:07:22,715
MATT: All right, so that finishes your turn,
Pike?

2500
03:07:22,715 --> 03:07:30,168
ASHLEY: Trying to think if I should move a little
bit.

2501
03:07:30,168 --> 03:07:32,933
LAURA: Move. Get out of range of him, if you can.

2502
03:07:32,933 --> 03:07:37,462
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to try to get out of range
of him and closer to my peeps.

2503
03:07:37,462 --> 03:07:42,309
MATT: Okay. So you'll get down, you can move about
that far.

2504
03:07:42,309 --> 03:07:43,955
MARISHA: You have a trammel, right, Pike?

2505
03:07:43,955 --> 03:07:47,966
ASHLEY: Oh, maybe, you know what? I'm going to
hang out right there, maybe.

2506
03:07:47,966 --> 03:07:51,672
MARISHA: Are we trying to get all three trammels
in in one round?

2507
03:07:51,672 --> 03:07:53,080
TALIESIN: That would be amazing.

2508
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:54,488
LAURA: That'd be killer. I don't know if we can.

2509
03:07:54,488 --> 03:07:58,866
MARISHA: I'm afraid he's going to try and yank
them out.

2510
03:07:58,866 --> 03:08:03,641
MATT: So that ends PIke's turn. Top of the round,
we're back to Vecna, who gets his legendary

2511
03:08:03,641 --> 03:08:05,089
actions back.

2512
03:08:05,089 --> 03:08:09,880
ASHLEY: Oh wait, wait, wait! Is there anyone-- can
I touch Grog, or is there anybody I'm near?

2513
03:08:09,880 --> 03:08:11,578
LAURA: Everybody's fully healed.

2514
03:08:11,578 --> 03:08:14,869
ASHLEY: No, I know, but is there anybody that I
can touch?

2515
03:08:14,869 --> 03:08:21,173
MATT: You would be able, you could fly up closer
to Vecna, or fly lower because you moved, with a

2516
03:08:21,173 --> 03:08:22,536
fly speed of 20--

2517
03:08:22,536 --> 03:08:24,826
LIAM: Are you thinking of blessing Grog and
Keyleth, or something like that?

2518
03:08:24,826 --> 03:08:31,500
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a little cantrip that I was
going to use, but-- Oh no, never mind, it's not a

2519
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:33,244
bonus. Never mind.

2520
03:08:33,244 --> 03:08:38,585
MATT: Okay, so Vecna's turn. Frustrated and
angry, as his Counterspell fizzles out of his

2521
03:08:38,585 --> 03:08:53,479
hand, "Very well. First and foremost, no friends."
He's going to go ahead and cast a high-level Hold

2522
03:08:53,479 --> 03:08:55,365
Monster.

2523
03:08:55,365 --> 03:08:58,737
WILL: It's been wonderful seeing you all again.

2524
03:08:58,737 --> 03:09:00,805
TALIESIN: The dragon cage is not concentration, is
it?

2525
03:09:00,805 --> 03:09:11,095
TRAVIS: Oh, the energy cage? Vecna's energy cage
is not concentration, right?

2526
03:09:11,095 --> 03:09:14,682
MATT: No. It lasts for an hour.

2527
03:09:14,682 --> 03:09:19,221
LAURA: Oh my god, really? Oh, poor J'mon!

2528
03:09:19,221 --> 03:09:21,272
LIAM: The face Ashley just made!

2529
03:09:21,272 --> 03:09:30,300
ASHLEY: They're going to be in there for a minute.
Nobody wants that dragon in the window.

2530
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:41,822
MATT: Fail, and fail. I need both Kashaw and Zahra
to make wisdom saving throws, please.

2531
03:09:41,908 --> 03:09:44,709
TRAVIS: The wyverns fall?

2532
03:09:44,709 --> 03:09:47,112
WILL: They better not fall.

2533
03:09:47,112 --> 03:09:50,827
SAM: Wait, is he freezing the wyverns or the--

2534
03:09:50,827 --> 03:09:53,100
MATT: All of them.

2535
03:09:53,100 --> 03:10:07,219
MARY: I'm going to use Luck. First luck. 22.

2536
03:10:07,219 --> 03:10:08,601
MATT: 22.

2537
03:10:08,601 --> 03:10:11,406
WILL: I rolled a natural one, plus four.

2538
03:10:11,406 --> 03:10:17,909
MATT: The wyvern wings immediately lock in place
as both of you feel your entire bodies slowly

2539
03:10:17,909 --> 03:10:25,070
seize up. You, with the wyverns, plummet out of
view.

2540
03:10:25,070 --> 03:10:26,742
MARY: Do I have a reaction?

2541
03:10:26,742 --> 03:10:28,430
MATT: No, you do not.

2542
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:31,802
LIAM: Did you just kill our guests?

2543
03:10:31,802 --> 03:10:34,336
MATT: You guys plummet out of sight.

2544
03:10:34,336 --> 03:10:37,453
LAURA: No!

2545
03:10:37,453 --> 03:10:41,496
MARISHA: Did you have something?

2546
03:10:41,496 --> 03:10:44,388
SAM: She did have a reaction! Can she use a
reaction?

2547
03:10:44,388 --> 03:10:46,337
MATT: What reaction would you like to do?

2548
03:10:46,337 --> 03:10:48,695
MARY: Hellish Rebuke.

2549
03:10:48,695 --> 03:10:56,136
MATT: Hellish Rebuke? You'd have to take, let's
see here. For Hellish Rebuke, you have to be hit

2550
03:10:56,136 --> 03:11:01,279
first, and then you return, but the Hold spell
prevents you from actually taking any actions or

2551
03:11:01,279 --> 03:11:02,503
reactions.

2552
03:11:02,503 --> 03:11:04,054
MARY: Is it Hold Person, or Hold Monster?

2553
03:11:04,054 --> 03:11:05,034
MATT: Hold Monster.

2554
03:11:05,034 --> 03:11:06,336
MARY: Oh, I'm not a monster.

2555
03:11:06,336 --> 03:11:10,717
MATT: It's a type of-- here.

2556
03:11:10,717 --> 03:11:13,179
LIAM: You're a monster!

2557
03:11:13,179 --> 03:11:19,069
SAM: It can do anything, human or monster.

2558
03:11:19,069 --> 03:11:23,275
MATT: It's a creature you can see. Hold Person is
designated for just people. Hold Monster's a

2559
03:11:23,275 --> 03:11:25,298
better version which can affect pretty much
anything.

2560
03:11:25,298 --> 03:11:28,457
MARY: Did you affect me, or did you affect my
wyvern?

2561
03:11:28,457 --> 03:11:29,491
TALIESIN: Yes.

2562
03:11:29,491 --> 03:11:30,597
MATT: Both.

2563
03:11:30,597 --> 03:11:31,776
MARY: How can you do that?

2564
03:11:31,776 --> 03:11:34,873
MATT: He cast it at a very high level.

2565
03:11:34,873 --> 03:11:37,062
MARY: I'm going to have to leave now.

2566
03:11:37,062 --> 03:11:40,988
TRAVIS: You will be avenged!

2567
03:11:40,988 --> 03:11:42,961
MARY: As before, we love you guys!

2568
03:11:42,961 --> 03:11:49,145
MARISHA: There's a lot you can do when you're
falling!

2569
03:11:49,145 --> 03:11:53,897
WILL: We can't even speak, can we?

2570
03:11:53,897 --> 03:12:00,200
MATT: No. You both quietly fall off the wyvern as
you plummet in silence past the edge, plummeting

2571
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:02,090
down the side of the tower.

2572
03:12:02,090 --> 03:12:04,907
LAURA: You guys got major damage, though!

2573
03:12:04,907 --> 03:12:08,797
MARY: At least the baby will be safe!

2574
03:12:08,797 --> 03:12:11,557
(yelling)

2575
03:12:11,557 --> 03:12:13,319
TALIESIN: No! No!

2576
03:12:13,319 --> 03:12:14,856
SAM: What baby?!

2577
03:12:14,856 --> 03:12:28,063
MARY: Avenge us!

2578
03:12:28,063 --> 03:12:31,200
SAM: What just happened!

2579
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:32,737
MARY: The three of us!

2580
03:12:32,737 --> 03:12:34,316
SAM: Three of us!

2581
03:12:34,316 --> 03:12:37,289
MARISHA: That was the worst blue balls ever.

2582
03:12:37,289 --> 03:12:39,386
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity.

2583
03:12:39,386 --> 03:12:43,978
LIAM: Oh yeah, okay, sneak attack. On my
advantage, because of Vow of Enmity.

2584
03:12:43,978 --> 03:12:45,673
MATT: You already used sneak attack before the end
of your last turn.

2585
03:12:45,673 --> 03:12:49,467
LIAM: I have been tweeted at by eight billion
people saying that on attack of opportunity on a

2586
03:12:49,467 --> 03:12:51,152
reaction, I get sneak attack.

2587
03:12:51,152 --> 03:12:52,360
MATT: You're right.

2588
03:12:52,360 --> 03:12:53,860
LIAM: Thanks, eight billion people!

2589
03:12:53,860 --> 03:12:57,697
TRAVIS: That's a lot of people. They should all
follow your social media accounts.

2590
03:12:57,697 --> 03:13:00,018
ASHLEY: Does anybody get an advantage after the
Guiding Bolt?

2591
03:13:00,018 --> 03:13:03,870
TALIESIN: Nobody's actually hit him with anything
since then.

2592
03:13:03,870 --> 03:13:10,257
SAM: Oh, oh, oh! I would like to know his wisdom
stat, please, Matt.

2593
03:13:10,257 --> 03:13:13,087
LAURA: Oh, you can do that!

2594
03:13:13,087 --> 03:13:14,953
MATT: His wisdom is 22.

2595
03:13:14,953 --> 03:13:17,847
SAM: That's what we have to beat with our
trammels.

2596
03:13:17,847 --> 03:13:20,748
TRAVIS: We have to roll higher than a 22?

2597
03:13:20,748 --> 03:13:27,958
LAURA: Well no, a 22 wisdom will get him plus
seven, or plus six, to his--

2598
03:13:27,958 --> 03:13:30,928
SAM: It's a DC ten, plus five for each divine
trammel.

2599
03:13:30,928 --> 03:13:35,465
MATT: That's his wisdom score. His wisdom saving
throw? Is that what you want to know?

2600
03:13:35,465 --> 03:13:36,473
SAM: Yes.

2601
03:13:36,473 --> 03:13:37,503
MATT: It's a plus ten.

2602
03:13:37,503 --> 03:13:38,774
SAM: Plus ten.

2603
03:13:38,774 --> 03:13:40,544
MATT: So whatever he rolls, plus ten.

2604
03:13:40,544 --> 03:13:45,201
LAURA: So he's got to roll a 20 and then add ten
to it. So we've got to roll--

2605
03:13:45,201 --> 03:13:53,031
SAM: Wait. So the trammel is a DC ten, plus five
for each trammel fused to the target. So he's got

2606
03:13:53,031 --> 03:13:57,835
a plus ten to save. Assume that he's going to roll
at least a ten.

2607
03:13:57,835 --> 03:14:01,497
TRAVIS: What do we hit the trammels in with? Our
strength?

2608
03:14:01,497 --> 03:14:03,965
SAM: So we have to get all three in.

2609
03:14:03,965 --> 03:14:05,938
LAURA: Yeah, we have to get them all in.

2610
03:14:05,938 --> 03:14:11,907
SAM: At least two. Wait, is that the stat I should
have asked for? I think, right?

2611
03:14:11,907 --> 03:14:14,761
MARISHA: It gives us a good answer.

2612
03:14:14,761 --> 03:14:18,632
TALIESIN: That's a 25 if we get all three in.

2613
03:14:18,632 --> 03:14:20,796
LIAM: I rolled a 34 to hit, so I'm going to start
rolling damage.

2614
03:14:20,796 --> 03:14:27,103
TALIESIN: That's the only thing that gives us a
fighting chance.

2615
03:14:27,103 --> 03:14:29,626
MATT: You're a little higher there, Vax.

2616
03:14:29,626 --> 03:14:31,381
LIAM: And I'll dump Smite into it, as well.

2617
03:14:31,381 --> 03:14:34,642
MATT: Go for it. So what's the total on that one,
the damage you just did?

2618
03:14:34,642 --> 03:14:44,324
LIAM: I didn't do any damage yet. (adding) Good.

2619
03:14:44,324 --> 03:14:47,471
TALIESIN: We get all three in, and then we get one
round.

2620
03:14:47,471 --> 03:14:55,526
MARISHA: So if we got two in, then he would have
to save over 20, so he would have to roll a ten or

2621
03:14:55,526 --> 03:14:56,566
higher.

2622
03:14:56,566 --> 03:14:57,608
LAURA: Which is so easy.

2623
03:14:57,608 --> 03:15:00,051
MARISHA: We have a 50/50 shot if we get two in
him.

2624
03:15:00,051 --> 03:15:01,840
LAURA: What are you doing?

2625
03:15:01,840 --> 03:15:04,910
SAM: And if we get three in him, 75% chance?

2626
03:15:04,910 --> 03:15:09,571
MARISHA: Yeah, but he can still save from it if he
rolls a 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.

2627
03:15:09,571 --> 03:15:15,541
SAM: And you've got to assume that he's got some
feat that can get him a ten whenever he wants, right?

2628
03:15:15,541 --> 03:15:19,458
LIAM: I'm calculating shit. I'm scared to death.

2629
03:15:19,458 --> 03:15:22,299
TALIESIN: This is, it's hard to do.

2630
03:15:22,299 --> 03:15:27,178
SAM: Critters, we love you. Thanks for watching
the show.

2631
03:15:27,178 --> 03:15:34,006
MATT: You watch as some of his wounds begin to
seal up. Looking at him, you get a sense that he

2632
03:15:34,006 --> 03:15:37,207
heals roughly, we'll say for the sake of this,
because it's the end of the game, why not. Heals

2633
03:15:37,207 --> 03:15:38,676
50 hit points a round.

2634
03:15:38,676 --> 03:15:40,565
MARISHA: 50 hit points a round?

2635
03:15:40,565 --> 03:15:43,130
SAM: We barely do 50 hit points a round!

2636
03:15:43,130 --> 03:15:45,182
MATT: You guys have been doing some good damage to
him.

2637
03:15:45,182 --> 03:15:46,440
TALIESIN: We've been hurting him.

2638
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:50,027
LIAM: Well I just hit him for a total, with Smite,
for a total of 65.

2639
03:15:50,027 --> 03:15:51,219
SAM: Dang.

2640
03:15:51,219 --> 03:15:52,860
TALIESIN: So that's gone.

2641
03:15:52,860 --> 03:15:56,597
SAM: Unless he can halve it or something.

2642
03:15:56,597 --> 03:15:58,858
MARISHA: Oh wait, you already did your action.

2643
03:15:58,858 --> 03:16:04,686
TALIESIN: There would be an effect if it were
halved. We would know. You can visually see when

2644
03:16:04,686 --> 03:16:06,309
someone doesn't take the full damage.

2645
03:16:06,309 --> 03:16:08,371
TRAVIS: That was attack of opportunity.

2646
03:16:08,371 --> 03:16:13,598
MATT: Yeah, you dodged away from him. All right.
So that brings us to Grog.

2647
03:16:13,598 --> 03:16:17,076
TRAVIS: So we're ten feet below him?

2648
03:16:17,076 --> 03:16:22,085
MARISHA: How far away is he now? From where we
moved?

2649
03:16:22,085 --> 03:16:24,963
TALIESIN: He was also connected by a sword to a
chain.

2650
03:16:24,963 --> 03:16:28,640
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, yeah, that's right.

2651
03:16:28,640 --> 03:16:38,205
MATT: Nope. I gave him a strength save to see if
he managed to push the sword away. Natural 20. So

2652
03:16:38,205 --> 03:16:42,809
the sword dislodges as he yanks it out of his
side. It dangles the chain and you pull it back up.

2653
03:16:42,809 --> 03:16:45,409
MARISHA: So how far away are we now, roughly?

2654
03:16:45,409 --> 03:16:50,214
MATT: From him, you are about, I'd say, 40-50
feet.

2655
03:16:50,214 --> 03:16:52,296
MARISHA: We were up under him a little bit.

2656
03:16:52,296 --> 03:16:55,481
MATT: You were here, so you're about, yeah, 50-60
feet from him that way.

2657
03:16:55,481 --> 03:17:01,424
MARISHA: If you want to hold again, I can get you
up there next. If you want to hold your attack

2658
03:17:01,424 --> 03:17:04,105
action. I can get you in melee range this time.

2659
03:17:04,105 --> 03:17:09,514
TRAVIS: I'll use my bonus action to pull the sword
back, so it's in my other hand. I mean, I could

2660
03:17:09,514 --> 03:17:10,643
roll for it--

2661
03:17:10,643 --> 03:17:12,589
LAURA: You can do Finger of Death this time.

2662
03:17:12,589 --> 03:17:18,009
TRAVIS: No, I'd probably hold my attack. If I hold
my action, I can hold one thing. So I'll hold

2663
03:17:18,009 --> 03:17:22,449
until I'm within melee. Yeah.

2664
03:17:22,449 --> 03:17:25,755
MARISHA: I can maybe, I can do an arc and do a
droppy thing on him?

2665
03:17:25,755 --> 03:17:31,751
TRAVIS: Just get me to him. Don't drop me, just
get me there. We've got to pull out all the stops.

2666
03:17:31,751 --> 03:17:32,947
It's all or nothing.

2667
03:17:32,947 --> 03:17:34,148
MATT: All right, so you're holding your action?

2668
03:17:34,148 --> 03:17:35,219
TRAVIS: Yes.

2669
03:17:35,219 --> 03:17:46,437
MATT: Okay. That brings us to, end of your turn,
he's going to go ahead and use two legendary

2670
03:17:46,437 --> 03:17:50,654
actions to cast Telekinesis with an extended
range.

2671
03:17:50,654 --> 03:18:00,442
SAM: What?! Telekinesis? What's he doing? What
does that do? That moves things, right?

2672
03:18:00,442 --> 03:18:07,539
MATT: Yes, but he has an extended range on all of
his spells because of his-- yeah. For most of his

2673
03:18:07,539 --> 03:18:19,306
spells, not all of them. So he looks down and
begins to rise his hand up. You watch as the

2674
03:18:19,306 --> 03:18:22,523
central column begins to shift.

2675
03:18:22,523 --> 03:18:24,489
SAM: What's on there?

2676
03:18:24,489 --> 03:18:30,066
MATT: Lift up higher and higher until about
midway, there.

2677
03:18:30,066 --> 03:18:33,041
SAM: What's that going to do?

2678
03:18:33,041 --> 03:18:38,680
MATT: Going to adjust this a little bit so we
can--

2679
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:45,593
TALIESIN: He's going to throw a boulder at us.

2680
03:18:45,593 --> 03:18:49,765
TRAVIS: Were Zahra and Kash petrified, or--

2681
03:18:49,765 --> 03:18:51,466
LAURA: They were held.

2682
03:18:51,466 --> 03:18:53,639
TRAVIS: Is that a concentration?

2683
03:18:53,639 --> 03:18:55,015
LIAM: They're going to splat.

2684
03:18:55,015 --> 03:18:56,508
LAURA: They fell.

2685
03:18:56,508 --> 03:18:58,276
TRAVIS: But we're like 400 feet up.

2686
03:18:58,276 --> 03:19:05,191
SAM: Yeah, but you just gave damage to Vecna,
right? Did he maintain his concentration, Matt?

2687
03:19:05,191 --> 03:19:13,219
LIAM: For holding Zahra and Kash, and the
monsters? Because I stabbed him in the face? Or in

2688
03:19:13,219 --> 03:19:15,790
the ass as he ran.

2689
03:19:15,790 --> 03:19:18,273
MARISHA: How epic would that be if they ran back
in?

2690
03:19:18,273 --> 03:19:29,142
MATT: Natural 20. They are currently now
plummeting off the side. You watched them

2691
03:19:29,142 --> 03:19:38,317
disappear from sight. As he goes ahead and lifts
that up, it shifts up into the space. We'll say

2692
03:19:38,317 --> 03:19:43,406
Pike is about there. All right. And that is his
spell.

2693
03:19:43,406 --> 03:19:46,617
SAM: What is he going to do with that thing?

2694
03:19:46,617 --> 03:19:50,435
MATT: So that ends Grog's turn. Vex, you're up.

2695
03:19:50,435 --> 03:19:56,153
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot some arrows at
him.

2696
03:19:56,153 --> 03:19:57,796
MATT: Go for it.

2697
03:19:57,796 --> 03:20:04,790
LAURA: Am I hidden? Can he see me? He probably
can. He can see all.

2698
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:06,795
MATT: He can see you. You don't get sneak attack.

2699
03:20:06,795 --> 03:20:10,656
LAURA: Of course not. But my brother is not with
him anymore.

2700
03:20:10,656 --> 03:20:13,604
MATT: Nope. He's currently floating up here
right now.

2701
03:20:13,604 --> 03:20:25,518
LAURA: Cool, tight. All right, then I'm going to
attack him with a needle arrow. Natural one. I'm

2702
03:20:25,518 --> 03:20:27,903
going to attack him with another.

2703
03:20:27,903 --> 03:20:31,069
MATT: It fires off to the side. The nerves kicking
in to you, unfortunately it doesn't strike true.

2704
03:20:31,069 --> 03:20:40,298
LAURA: Well I just bundled up my sister. Yeah,
that just happened, still. Cool, I'm going to try

2705
03:20:40,298 --> 03:20:46,533
to hit him again, with another needle arrow. Okay,
that probably hits. Yeah, that's a 28.

2706
03:20:46,533 --> 03:20:48,117
MATT: That hits.

2707
03:20:48,117 --> 03:20:51,701
LAURA: It's a plus one, because it's a needle
arrow.

2708
03:20:51,701 --> 03:20:53,758
SAM: Does it smell like Taryon?

2709
03:20:53,758 --> 03:21:10,560
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to call out: For Tary! How
about that? 11, is that it?

2710
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:13,290
SAM: Does he have Hunter's Mark or anything?

2711
03:21:13,290 --> 03:21:19,528
LAURA: Oh yeah. 16 points of damage.

2712
03:21:19,528 --> 03:21:27,050
MATT: 16 points of damage, all righty. Got it.
All right, does that end your turn?

2713
03:21:27,050 --> 03:21:33,794
LAURA: No, I'm going to move. I'm going to move
around, over to here.

2714
03:21:33,794 --> 03:21:37,389
MATT: All right, so you shift over to the side. Go
ahead and place yourself here.

2715
03:21:37,389 --> 03:21:39,156
LAURA: And I'm still on my broom.

2716
03:21:39,156 --> 03:21:44,453
MATT: Floating up there. Perfect. All righty. Is
that your turn?

2717
03:21:44,453 --> 03:21:52,071
LAURA: I'm going to use, well, I don't really have
anything I can do with my bonus action. Oh no!

2718
03:21:52,071 --> 03:22:01,000
It's foreshadowing! That's it.

2719
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:06,967
MATT: All right, that's it. At the end of your
turn, he's going to use two more legendary

2720
03:22:06,967 --> 03:22:15,857
actions. As he's off on the other side and he's
been lifting this large rock up into the air, it

2721
03:22:15,857 --> 03:22:21,190
slips up higher and higher, into the center space.
He's carefully guiding it to position as he holds

2722
03:22:21,190 --> 03:22:29,577
it there. He glances about. "Well, it seems, I
assume, that many of your tanks are now empty. I

2723
03:22:29,577 --> 03:22:36,968
"hate to be repetitive, but I'm extremely
frustrated with how hard it is to kill you!" As he

2724
03:22:36,968 --> 03:22:41,396
brings his hand, other hand up in the air, you
hear an even louder tear as, a third time, the sky

2725
03:22:41,396 --> 03:22:50,166
opens up. This time, sending a meteor that side,
this side, and crashing into the side here, to

2726
03:22:50,166 --> 03:22:52,803
impact and explode in a 40-foot radius up in the
air above.

2727
03:22:52,803 --> 03:22:55,002
SAM: Oh god, so he needed ground.

2728
03:22:55,002 --> 03:22:56,633
TRAVIS: That's what he was doing.

2729
03:22:56,633 --> 03:22:58,870
TALIESIN: He has a third spell?

2730
03:22:58,870 --> 03:23:02,012
MATT: That's his third and final 9th-level spell.

2731
03:23:02,012 --> 03:23:03,836
SAM: Damn.

2732
03:23:03,836 --> 03:23:06,406
LAURA: Damn it, god power!

2733
03:23:06,406 --> 03:23:09,447
ASHLEY: That's so many 9th-levels, yo!

2734
03:23:09,447 --> 03:23:13,178
TRAVIS: Fail, but I'm going to use my Stone's
Endurance to further--

2735
03:23:13,178 --> 03:23:14,856
LIAM: Dex save, right?

2736
03:23:14,856 --> 03:23:16,711
MATT: Dex save for everybody.

2737
03:23:16,711 --> 03:23:19,056
TALIESIN: We got hit by meteor again.

2738
03:23:19,056 --> 03:23:22,981
SAM: Any sort of advantage?

2739
03:23:22,981 --> 03:23:26,138
TRAVIS: He hit the giant platform that he was
raising.

2740
03:23:26,138 --> 03:23:28,643
MARISHA: Advantage against spell saves, yeah?

2741
03:23:28,643 --> 03:23:32,951
MATT: The platform is destroyed from the impact, by
the way, so that central column is now missing.

2742
03:23:32,951 --> 03:23:34,642
TALIESIN: Fuck me.

2743
03:23:34,642 --> 03:23:35,813
MARISHA: Dex?

2744
03:23:35,813 --> 03:23:39,579
LIAM: Dex save, yeah. You're blessed, so add a
d4.

2745
03:23:39,579 --> 03:23:41,160
ASHLEY: Is this also for people flying?

2746
03:23:41,160 --> 03:23:44,802
MATT: Yep, he pulled it right up beneath you and
one of the meteors slammed into.

2747
03:23:44,802 --> 03:23:46,636
TALIESIN: Fuck, man. Nope.

2748
03:23:46,636 --> 03:23:52,055
MATT: So Scanlan?

2749
03:23:52,055 --> 03:23:53,603
SAM: Nine!

2750
03:23:53,603 --> 03:23:54,785
TALIESIN: 16.

2751
03:23:54,785 --> 03:23:55,980
MARISHA: 20.

2752
03:23:55,980 --> 03:23:56,939
LIAM: 34.

2753
03:23:56,939 --> 03:23:58,123
LAURA: 34.

2754
03:23:58,123 --> 03:23:59,722
TRAVIS: Less than 20.

2755
03:23:59,722 --> 03:24:05,992
MATT: All right, so. That is 72 points of
bludgeoning damage.

2756
03:24:05,992 --> 03:24:07,963
SAM: That's not so bad, right guys?

2757
03:24:07,963 --> 03:24:09,640
MARISHA: Resisted, so--

2758
03:24:09,640 --> 03:24:10,950
MATT: Right, so half of that.

2759
03:24:10,950 --> 03:24:14,985
MARISHA: 72, so 34, 35?

2760
03:24:14,985 --> 03:24:26,855
MATT: 36, technically. Half of 72. No damage to
you. Then half damage to you, so take 36. You take

2761
03:24:26,855 --> 03:24:31,566
full. Percy, you take the full. Then 65 points of
fire damage.

2762
03:24:31,566 --> 03:24:33,515
LAURA: Halved, again.

2763
03:24:33,515 --> 03:24:35,932
SAM: So what is that, total?

2764
03:24:35,932 --> 03:24:38,714
MATT: So 32, yeah.

2765
03:24:38,714 --> 03:24:41,180
TALIESIN: So what's the total?

2766
03:24:41,180 --> 03:24:45,497
MATT: The total would be 72 and 65, that would be
137.

2767
03:24:45,497 --> 03:24:48,125
LAURA: He knocked us right back down.

2768
03:24:48,125 --> 03:24:54,130
ASHLEY: Is the fire halved because of the--? And
what was the fire again? I'm so sorry.

2769
03:24:54,130 --> 03:24:57,009
MATT: So you only take 32 points of fire damage.

2770
03:24:57,009 --> 03:25:00,323
ASHLEY: So 72.

2771
03:25:00,323 --> 03:25:03,634
MATT: Yeah. He had other spells at his disposal,
but you guys kept fucking healing.

2772
03:25:03,634 --> 03:25:09,337
TRAVIS: Stone's Endurance. Six plus six, 12. So
less 12.

2773
03:25:09,337 --> 03:25:12,263
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

2774
03:25:12,263 --> 03:25:16,437
MARISHA: Thank god we healed. We would've all been
dead.

2775
03:25:16,437 --> 03:25:18,398
TRAVIS: So 55 points of damage.

2776
03:25:18,398 --> 03:25:21,696
LAURA: I mean, that would have killed us right
off. Straight up.

2777
03:25:21,696 --> 03:25:23,865
TALIESIN: Yeah, that would've been the end of us.
Right there.

2778
03:25:23,865 --> 03:25:25,887
TRAVIS: Fucking Pike, man.

2779
03:25:25,887 --> 03:25:31,630
MATT: All right, so. That ends Vex's turn. Vax,
you're up.

2780
03:25:31,630 --> 03:25:36,857
LIAM: Okay, so with a split second and that
erupted all around us, I have a moment to

2781
03:25:36,857 --> 03:25:43,018
appreciate all of this angelic fucking flexing and
taking all of that damage. I take out my superior

2782
03:25:43,018 --> 03:25:49,002
healing potion, kiss Keyleth on the cheek, and
feed her the potion. That's my action, my regular

2783
03:25:49,002 --> 03:25:50,187
action.

2784
03:25:50,187 --> 03:25:52,996
MARISHA: You're feeding me a potion? Hey babe--
(gagging)

2785
03:25:52,996 --> 03:26:01,581
LIAM: Then I'm flying eye-level with Vecna. Yeah,
am I within 60 feet there?

2786
03:26:01,581 --> 03:26:03,683
MATT: You're probably a little bit closer.

2787
03:26:03,683 --> 03:26:08,241
LIAM: I'll get a little bit closer, and then I
will use my hasted action to chuck a dagger at his

2788
03:26:08,241 --> 03:26:09,602
fucking face.

2789
03:26:09,602 --> 03:26:10,683
MARISHA: You fed me a superior?

2790
03:26:10,683 --> 03:26:16,368
LIAM: Yeah. Natural 20 with Whisper.

2791
03:26:16,368 --> 03:26:20,485
TALIESIN: Okay! We've got to start putting some
trammels in this guy.

2792
03:26:20,485 --> 03:26:25,450
MARISHA: Okay, 8d4s.

2793
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:40,581
LIAM: (counting) 64, plus the psychic. 69 with
Whisper.

2794
03:26:40,581 --> 03:26:43,617
MATT: 69 points of damage. All righty.

2795
03:26:43,617 --> 03:26:46,393
LIAM: And I will bamf there.

2796
03:26:46,393 --> 03:26:52,526
MATT: All right, so with that you appear directly
into Vecna's face. The blade still clasped in your

2797
03:26:52,526 --> 03:26:56,515
hand almost, where you appear next to it. It's
jammed right into the clavicle area, and as it

2798
03:26:56,515 --> 03:27:01,485
broke through you can see the glowing energy
within the ribcage flashes bright with anger as

2799
03:27:01,485 --> 03:27:06,004
the eye bursts forth. Where once it was this
crackling arcane energy, there's now a visible giant

2800
03:27:06,004 --> 03:27:12,504
green flame billowing out like an angry fire,
(flames crackling).

2801
03:27:12,504 --> 03:27:13,828
LAURA: You've got one.

2802
03:27:13,828 --> 03:27:25,417
LIAM: I do, but it's weak. I'll use my last bonus
action to stab again. With Whisper. 28. To hit.

2803
03:27:25,417 --> 03:27:26,885
MATT: Hits.

2804
03:27:26,885 --> 03:27:31,602
LIAM: (counting) 20.

2805
03:27:31,602 --> 03:27:37,364
MATT: 20 points of damage will be the final
attack. All right. That ends your turn? All right,

2806
03:27:37,364 --> 03:27:47,435
so who's at low hit points?

2807
03:27:47,435 --> 03:27:48,887
SAM: Everybody?

2808
03:27:48,887 --> 03:27:50,637
TRAVIS: No.

2809
03:27:50,637 --> 03:27:53,367
MARISHA: What constitutes as low?

2810
03:27:53,367 --> 03:27:55,337
MATT: Well here, how many hit points do you have?

2811
03:27:55,337 --> 03:27:58,413
SAM: Are you going to use it to kill me, Matt?

2812
03:27:58,413 --> 03:28:02,606
MATT: Vecna can see through your physical forms.

2813
03:28:02,606 --> 03:28:04,764
SAM: 32 hit points.

2814
03:28:04,764 --> 03:28:06,180
TALIESIN: 59.

2815
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:07,700
MARISHA: 131.

2816
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:10,396
LIAM: 129.

2817
03:28:10,396 --> 03:28:11,836
LAURA: 70.

2818
03:28:11,836 --> 03:28:13,600
TRAVIS: 224.

2819
03:28:13,600 --> 03:28:15,322
ASHLEY: 36.

2820
03:28:15,322 --> 03:28:25,365
MATT: 36, all righty. All right, he's going to use
his third, or sorry, his final legendary action

2821
03:28:25,365 --> 03:28:28,558
for this round to cast Firebolt at you, Scanlan.

2822
03:28:28,558 --> 03:28:34,639
SAM: I cannot protect against that. I have no
Counterspell that reaches him. Right?

2823
03:28:34,639 --> 03:28:39,919
MATT: At this moment, no. That is an eight plus
16, that is a 24 to hit.

2824
03:28:39,919 --> 03:28:41,173
SAM: That hits.

2825
03:28:41,173 --> 03:28:47,133
MATT: All right. You suffer 23 points of fire
damage.

2826
03:28:47,133 --> 03:28:48,509
SAM: Great.

2827
03:28:48,509 --> 03:28:55,713
MATT: All righty. So at the end of Vax's turn,
that brings us to the 20 initiative count. At this

2828
03:28:55,713 --> 03:28:57,285
point in time--

2829
03:28:57,285 --> 03:28:58,721
TRAVIS: J'mon's still in the cage?

2830
03:28:58,721 --> 03:29:03,634
MATT: J'mon is smashing into the sides of the
Forcecage and looking around at the rest of you

2831
03:29:03,634 --> 03:29:06,888
guys, unable to escape.

2832
03:29:06,888 --> 03:29:08,541
SAM: Doesn't have Teleport?

2833
03:29:08,541 --> 03:29:10,988
MATT: Not all dragons are spellcasters.

2834
03:29:10,988 --> 03:29:14,783
TRAVIS: And we can't dispel it, right? I'll dispel
it.

2835
03:29:14,783 --> 03:29:26,900
MATT: All right, so. Five skeletons rise up from
the ground.

2836
03:29:26,900 --> 03:29:29,600
LIAM: Oh no!

2837
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:31,545
TRAVIS: Around Scanlan?

2838
03:29:31,545 --> 03:29:33,930
LIAM: Oh, death saves, handing out death saves.

2839
03:29:33,930 --> 03:29:36,310
MARISHA: Why are they all around Scanlan? Percy's
there!

2840
03:29:36,310 --> 03:29:39,430
LIAM: They're getting ready to do the finishing
move on him.

2841
03:29:39,430 --> 03:29:40,991
LAURA: They're going to try to take him out.

2842
03:29:40,991 --> 03:29:42,943
LIAM: Take him out, and then stab him while he's
down.

2843
03:29:42,943 --> 03:29:51,895
MATT: So first attack, natural two. That misses.
Second one, natural four. That's 11?

2844
03:29:51,895 --> 03:29:53,228
SAM: Nope.

2845
03:29:53,228 --> 03:29:58,009
MATT: Third attack, natural two. Luck is working
in your favor, so far. Fourth attack, that's going

2846
03:29:58,009 --> 03:29:59,242
to be a 19.

2847
03:29:59,242 --> 03:30:00,232
SAM: That hits.

2848
03:30:00,232 --> 03:30:01,592
MATT: Six points of slashing damage.

2849
03:30:01,592 --> 03:30:02,615
TALIESIN: You're still up!

2850
03:30:02,615 --> 03:30:06,787
MATT: Final attack is six plus seven, that's 13.
What's your AC?

2851
03:30:06,787 --> 03:30:08,050
SAM: 14.

2852
03:30:08,050 --> 03:30:15,560
MATT: Oh, shit! So these skeletons are swarming
you, hacking and swinging away, trying their best

2853
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:18,503
to finish you off, and you barely dodge through
some of them--

2854
03:30:18,503 --> 03:30:22,807
LAURA: He's so little the skeletons are swinging
above him!

2855
03:30:22,807 --> 03:30:26,299
SAM: I'm at three.

2856
03:30:26,299 --> 03:30:36,493
MATT: At this point in time, you glance over and
see a fist grab the rock side of one of these

2857
03:30:36,493 --> 03:30:37,444
platforms--

2858
03:30:37,444 --> 03:30:38,923
SAM: No, it doesn't!

2859
03:30:38,923 --> 03:30:46,121
MATT: You watch as a second gauntleted fist hits
the side, and climbing up over the edge of one of

2860
03:30:46,121 --> 03:30:52,944
these platforms you see immediately the red-scaled
face and horned body of a heavily-wounded but

2861
03:30:52,944 --> 03:30:57,433
still-living Arkhan making his way up onto the
platform.

2862
03:30:57,433 --> 03:31:05,061
(cheering)

2863
03:31:05,061 --> 03:31:06,519
TALIESIN: Oh, let's go! This is on. It's fucking
on.

2864
03:31:06,519 --> 03:31:08,490
MARISHA: You're not going to kill another of our
friends in front of us, are you?

2865
03:31:08,490 --> 03:31:10,914
LIAM: Vox Machina, This. Is. Your Life!

2866
03:31:10,914 --> 03:31:16,584
JOE: You didn't think I was going to miss this
party, did you? Sorry I was late.

2867
03:31:16,584 --> 03:31:17,996
MARISHA: Joe, don't die.

2868
03:31:17,996 --> 03:31:22,154
MATT: You watch as one of the hands removes itself
from the building, and you can see this

2869
03:31:22,154 --> 03:31:28,406
translucent set of chromatic wings that are
drifting off of the giant, armored dragonborn's

2870
03:31:28,406 --> 03:31:29,565
shoulders.

2871
03:31:29,565 --> 03:31:30,649
LAURA: You've got wings?

2872
03:31:30,649 --> 03:31:31,947
JOE: I had a flight potion. Red Bull.

2873
03:31:31,947 --> 03:31:34,391
MARISHA: Gives you wings!

2874
03:31:34,391 --> 03:31:37,310
JOE: Thank you, Mike Mearls, by the way.

2875
03:31:37,310 --> 03:31:41,410
SAM: Bro-barians.

2876
03:31:41,410 --> 03:31:44,068
JOE: The bros are back!

2877
03:31:44,068 --> 03:31:45,485
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2878
03:31:45,485 --> 03:31:47,426
MARISHA: (singing) The bros are back in town!

2879
03:31:47,426 --> 03:31:55,414
MATT: What do you want to do? It took most of your
flight to get to this point. You have another

2880
03:31:55,414 --> 03:31:56,899
action, though.

2881
03:31:56,899 --> 03:31:58,277
JOE: I have another action.

2882
03:31:58,277 --> 03:31:59,894
MATT: Well you have an action and a bonus action.

2883
03:31:59,894 --> 03:32:01,322
LAURA: Where are you at, Arkhan?

2884
03:32:01,322 --> 03:32:02,467
TALIESIN: Right down there.

2885
03:32:02,467 --> 03:32:03,628
JOE: I'm down on the ground?

2886
03:32:03,628 --> 03:32:04,911
SAM: Super far from the guy.

2887
03:32:04,911 --> 03:32:11,454
JOE: I am super far. Okay. Did my <i>friend</i> get my
signal?

2888
03:32:11,454 --> 03:32:13,325
MATT: He hasn't arrived yet.

2889
03:32:13,325 --> 03:32:14,551
JOE: Okay.

2890
03:32:14,551 --> 03:32:17,505
SAM: (whispers) That's what he calls his dick!

2891
03:32:17,505 --> 03:32:21,540
JOE: Then I guess I'm going to--

2892
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:25,099
MATT: There are still two gloomstalkers also that
are about to take their turn.

2893
03:32:25,099 --> 03:32:29,141
JOE: Okay. So I can fly 60?

2894
03:32:29,141 --> 03:32:35,144
MATT: Yes. But you've used your movement. You'd
have to use your action to dash.

2895
03:32:35,144 --> 03:32:46,509
JOE: Use my action to get up there. Okay. Then I
am going to get within-- Okay, 60 and a bonus

2896
03:32:46,509 --> 03:32:49,667
action? So could I get up to him and then use a
bonus attack?

2897
03:32:49,667 --> 03:32:54,635
MATT: He's unfortunately more than 60 feet away
from you. Yeah, you can get to about this point

2898
03:32:54,635 --> 03:32:56,417
with a full 60 movement.

2899
03:32:56,417 --> 03:32:58,182
SAM: Can you throw anything? Cast anything?

2900
03:32:58,182 --> 03:33:03,419
JOE: I could throw a javelin. One of those fun
little javelins.

2901
03:33:03,419 --> 03:33:10,613
SAM: There's also a bunch of pop-up undeads around
us if you want to mop them up.

2902
03:33:10,613 --> 03:33:13,462
JOE: How high is he up from about there?

2903
03:33:13,462 --> 03:33:18,955
MATT: At a glance, close to 80 feet.

2904
03:33:18,955 --> 03:33:21,657
JOE: 80. Okay. Then I've got to get up to where
Pike is.

2905
03:33:21,657 --> 03:33:29,660
MATT: Okay. So dash action? Using these chromatic
wings granted by the flight potion and the

2906
03:33:29,660 --> 03:33:33,948
dramatic effect of Tiamat's blessing, you manage
to glide up next to Pike, both of you with your

2907
03:33:33,948 --> 03:33:44,813
very opposite visual of god-granted wings, side to
side. You see Pike with singe marks on her face,

2908
03:33:44,813 --> 03:33:48,943
her hair tousled, the bludgeoning causing blood to
pour from the side of her ears and the corner of

2909
03:33:48,943 --> 03:33:54,667
her mouth. You look over at Arkhan next to you,
part of his flesh has been necrotically burned

2910
03:33:54,667 --> 03:34:00,256
away and you can see heavy wounds. It looks like
he's sustained a bit of a heavy fray with the

2911
03:34:00,256 --> 03:34:02,703
death knight, but he's not being followed at the
moment.

2912
03:34:02,703 --> 03:34:07,547
JOE: So I hold up the helmet of the death knight
and the head of Delilah, and drop them down into

2913
03:34:07,547 --> 03:34:14,316
the crack in front of them. And I guess I'm going
to try to throw a javelin.

2914
03:34:14,316 --> 03:34:15,898
MATT: As a bonus action?

2915
03:34:15,898 --> 03:34:17,893
JOE: As my frenzied bonus action.

2916
03:34:17,893 --> 03:34:19,020
MATT: Okay, yeah.

2917
03:34:19,020 --> 03:34:21,643
TRAVIS: Hell, yeah. Why not? We got it, man.

2918
03:34:21,643 --> 03:34:34,554
JOE: Okay, that's a 20 to hit.

2919
03:34:34,554 --> 03:34:40,148
MATT: 20 to hit? Unfortunately, it hits the front
of Vecna's body, and you watch as the javelin

2920
03:34:40,148 --> 03:34:44,399
splinters apart into a hundred different pieces of
wood and metal.

2921
03:34:44,399 --> 03:34:46,142
JOE: Javelins not so good.

2922
03:34:46,142 --> 03:34:50,706
SAM: You got any healing, you got any bonuses, you
got anything?

2923
03:34:50,706 --> 03:34:53,672
JOE: Not like the healing bonuses-- reactions.

2924
03:34:53,672 --> 03:34:56,327
TRAVIS: We look like healing bonus people to you?

2925
03:34:56,327 --> 03:35:04,001
MATT: Both of these guys arc upward,
gloomstalkers. This guy here is going to shriek.

2926
03:35:04,001 --> 03:35:11,301
He gives out this horrible sound. As it swings
out, I need wisdom saving throws from both

2927
03:35:11,301 --> 03:35:12,368
Scanlan--

2928
03:35:12,368 --> 03:35:14,485
LAURA: We're immune to fear and you have advantage
on any wisdom saving throws.

2929
03:35:14,485 --> 03:35:15,703
MATT: This isn't a fear-based thing.

2930
03:35:15,703 --> 03:35:16,764
TALIESIN: Is it magic?

2931
03:35:16,764 --> 03:35:17,857
MATT: It is magic.

2932
03:35:17,857 --> 03:35:22,943
TALIESIN: All right, so I have advantage. Natural
20.

2933
03:35:22,943 --> 03:35:27,384
TRAVIS: Come on, snitch. More of that.

2934
03:35:27,384 --> 03:35:28,843
SAM: 13.

2935
03:35:28,843 --> 03:35:32,003
MATT: Okay. Wait, you have Freedom of Action cast
on you, right?

2936
03:35:32,003 --> 03:35:33,194
SAM: Yeah. Freedom of Movement.

2937
03:35:33,194 --> 03:35:34,527
MATT: It's a paralyzation effect. It has no
effect.

2938
03:35:34,527 --> 03:35:36,789
TALIESIN: Yeah. I can't be paralyzed anyway.

2939
03:35:36,789 --> 03:35:40,389
MATT: Nope. So this one, however, is going to land
and is going to try make an assault on you,

2940
03:35:40,389 --> 03:35:48,712
Percival. That's going to be 28 to hit?

2941
03:35:48,712 --> 03:35:50,549
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

2942
03:35:50,549 --> 03:35:58,098
MATT: You suffer 17 points of piercing damage and
seven necrotic. 24 total. It's going to also claw

2943
03:35:58,098 --> 03:36:00,540
you. And that's a 21 to hit.

2944
03:36:00,540 --> 03:36:01,971
TALIESIN: That also hits.

2945
03:36:01,971 --> 03:36:03,387
MATT: Take 13 points of slashing damage.

2946
03:36:03,387 --> 03:36:12,512
TALIESIN: All right, so that's (counting) 22. I'm
at 22 hit points. That's fine. I can handle that.

2947
03:36:12,512 --> 03:36:17,941
MATT: All righty. That is going to bring us to
Keyleth.

2948
03:36:17,941 --> 03:36:26,209
MARISHA: Okay. Still in our synchronised swimming
stance, I fly up and--

2949
03:36:26,209 --> 03:36:31,858
MATT: So you fly up from this point. Got to pull
you up a bit.

2950
03:36:31,858 --> 03:36:37,083
MARISHA: I'm going to drop Grog onto Vecna and
then do my own thing.

2951
03:36:37,083 --> 03:36:40,310
MATT: Okay. So you fly up. Grog, what are you
doing at this point?

2952
03:36:40,310 --> 03:36:44,002
TRAVIS: I'm going to use that held action to
attack twice.

2953
03:36:44,002 --> 03:36:48,172
MATT: Okay. You'll be falling if she drops you.

2954
03:36:48,172 --> 03:36:54,218
TRAVIS: No. My first attack is going to be a
grapple and with the second attack, I'm going to

2955
03:36:54,218 --> 03:36:55,650
shank him.

2956
03:36:55,650 --> 03:36:57,304
MATT: Roll an athletics check.

2957
03:36:57,304 --> 03:37:00,528
MARISHA: Can I give him a little bit of a boost?

2958
03:37:00,528 --> 03:37:01,799
MATT: Yeah. Totally.

2959
03:37:01,799 --> 03:37:02,973
MARISHA: Okay!

2960
03:37:02,973 --> 03:37:07,602
TRAVIS: 23.

2961
03:37:07,602 --> 03:37:13,537
MATT: 23? Rolled a 16 plus five. That's a 21. So
you succeed!

2962
03:37:13,537 --> 03:37:15,846
SAM: Wait. He's grappled?

2963
03:37:15,846 --> 03:37:18,422
MATT: Well I mean, grappled is not going to stop
him--

2964
03:37:18,422 --> 03:37:19,665
SAM: He's immune to grapple.

2965
03:37:19,665 --> 03:37:26,286
MATT: No, he's not immune to grapple. But it does
not stop his movement because of his size. But

2966
03:37:26,286 --> 03:37:34,723
you're attached to him. So currently, at the
moment, you are locked into Vecna's current

2967
03:37:34,723 --> 03:37:36,512
little-- I'll put you there.

2968
03:37:36,512 --> 03:37:38,368
LAURA: Just hanging out.

2969
03:37:38,368 --> 03:37:46,897
TRAVIS: And instead of a d10, I'll hit him with a
one-handed versatile d8. Reckless. Natural 20.

2970
03:37:46,897 --> 03:37:50,053
(cheers and laughter)

2971
03:37:50,053 --> 03:37:52,453
SAM: Is that a--

2972
03:37:52,453 --> 03:37:53,822
LIAM and TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2973
03:37:53,822 --> 03:37:57,346
SAM: That's a crit! That's a critical roll?

2974
03:37:57,346 --> 03:38:05,987
MARISHA: Oh man, it took 114 episodes that we
finally have a title name drop in our show. It's a

2975
03:38:05,987 --> 03:38:07,277
critical roll.

2976
03:38:07,277 --> 03:38:10,308
MATT: It's just crazy.

2977
03:38:10,308 --> 03:38:13,465
SAM: Trammel that shit.

2978
03:38:13,465 --> 03:38:21,830
TRAVIS: 14 plus 12. Help me.

2979
03:38:21,830 --> 03:38:22,961
LIAM: 26!

2980
03:38:22,961 --> 03:38:27,620
TRAVIS: 26. Thank you. 26 plus 14 is--

2981
03:38:27,620 --> 03:38:29,209
JOE: 40.

2982
03:38:29,209 --> 03:38:31,816
SAM: Oh shit!

2983
03:38:31,816 --> 03:38:33,268
LIAM: You've said that like 17 times.

2984
03:38:33,268 --> 03:38:39,018
SAM: I've had advantage on all saving throws this
whole time and I haven't been using it.

2985
03:38:39,018 --> 03:38:40,637
JOE: How many of those things do you have?

2986
03:38:40,637 --> 03:38:42,555
SAM: From the Blessing of the Knowing Mistress!

2987
03:38:42,555 --> 03:38:44,216
MARISHA: Don't forget your blessings!

2988
03:38:44,216 --> 03:38:48,458
SAM: That wouldn't have been any better.

2989
03:38:48,458 --> 03:38:50,772
TRAVIS: 58, 64.

2990
03:38:50,772 --> 03:38:54,947
MATT: 64. With a one-handed strike, right? Just a
d8?

2991
03:38:54,947 --> 03:39:00,592
SAM: Oh! Is that necrotic? What is it,
bludgeoning?

2992
03:39:00,592 --> 03:39:07,547
TRAVIS: 68, 76--

2993
03:39:07,547 --> 03:39:09,634
MATT: It's the brutal critical, right?

2994
03:39:09,634 --> 03:39:12,185
TRAVIS: There's one more after the 76.

2995
03:39:12,185 --> 03:39:15,723
MATT: Well it's only two dice, technically.
Because you took levels in fighter. That was my

2996
03:39:15,723 --> 03:39:17,259
fault last time.

2997
03:39:17,259 --> 03:39:18,318
TRAVIS: 81.

2998
03:39:18,318 --> 03:39:20,479
MATT: 81 points of damage.

2999
03:39:20,479 --> 03:39:22,740
SAM: How much were necrotic?

3000
03:39:22,740 --> 03:39:27,431
MATT: None of them. It's all slashing. Sword of
Kas!

3001
03:39:27,431 --> 03:39:29,262
TRAVIS: One thing.

3002
03:39:29,262 --> 03:39:43,466
MATT: Kill fucking Vecna. As Keyletar lifts and
thrusts you upward, you reach out and as Vecna

3003
03:39:43,466 --> 03:39:47,888
tries to dodge out of the way, you manage to grab
onto the side of the ribcage. As you're clutching

3004
03:39:47,888 --> 03:39:51,337
on the side of it, and by the way, the rib itself
is this wide around your hand, although with your

3005
03:39:51,337 --> 03:39:56,358
titan form, your fingers barely close around it.
You swing and dangle, and as you do, you take the

3006
03:39:56,358 --> 03:40:01,319
blade and jam it right up into where the force of
the greenish energy in the chest where the ribcage

3007
03:40:01,319 --> 03:40:07,342
is, and as you strike it, there's a burst of
energy out from inside out of him, and Vecna

3008
03:40:07,342 --> 03:40:18,515
screams as the sword at the back of your mind
goes, "Yes!" You guys watch at this point to those

3009
03:40:18,515 --> 03:40:25,754
who are close by, the red glow of the coal-like
glow in Grog's eyes, the vampiric eyes are flaring

3010
03:40:25,855 --> 03:40:33,803
now as the anger of the sword is now synchronizing
with his hatred. As you jam it inside, the burst

3011
03:40:33,803 --> 03:40:38,385
pushes the blade out, but now you can see another
little sparkle of light within the inside of that

3012
03:40:38,385 --> 03:40:44,677
pulsing glow in his chest. You can see now, three
distinct, currently available weaknesses in his

3013
03:40:44,677 --> 03:40:52,430
avatar form. However, he will continue to heal and
if he heals, those begin to close. So yes?

3014
03:40:52,430 --> 03:41:01,142
MARISHA: Okay. So after he does that, Keyletar is
going to swing around and find another one of

3015
03:41:01,142 --> 03:41:07,294
those openings and I'm going to take my greatsword
and do my multi-attack and jam it right into one

3016
03:41:07,294 --> 03:41:15,094
of his openings and open it up a little wider. Got
to get it nice and good.

3017
03:41:15,094 --> 03:41:16,372
MATT: Go for it.

3018
03:41:16,372 --> 03:41:29,591
MARISHA: Okay. Getting it nice and good! Okay, so
first attack-- opal dice, don't fuck me. You

3019
03:41:29,591 --> 03:41:31,320
always fuck me. 18.

3020
03:41:31,320 --> 03:41:32,948
SAM: You get a plus four on something, right?

3021
03:41:32,948 --> 03:41:39,113
MARISHA: Yeah, on attacks too! (gasps) 22?

3022
03:41:39,113 --> 03:41:44,905
MATT: 22 <i>just</i> misses. His AC is 23.

3023
03:41:44,905 --> 03:41:52,987
MARISHA: We learned something! Second attack, got
to roll better than a fucking four! That

3024
03:41:52,987 --> 03:41:54,078
definitely hits.

3025
03:41:54,078 --> 03:41:56,274
MATT: All right, so go and roll your damage on
that.

3026
03:41:56,274 --> 03:42:07,618
MARISHA: Okay. 4d6 plus seven, and then I get 4d6.
I don't do this normally. Okay, six, ten, 15 plus

3027
03:42:07,692 --> 03:42:10,025
another 5d8 radiant damage.

3028
03:42:10,025 --> 03:42:11,608
SAM: Ooh, that's a lot!

3029
03:42:11,608 --> 03:42:15,471
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, because I'm a planetar!

3030
03:42:15,471 --> 03:42:17,497
SAM: Pat Planetar.

3031
03:42:17,497 --> 03:42:33,307
MARISHA: Not bad! Eight, five is 13. Another seven
is 20. Ones, not for sword damage. 22 and another

3032
03:42:33,307 --> 03:42:34,843
six, 28!

3033
03:42:34,843 --> 03:42:36,454
LAURA: 28 plus 15.

3034
03:42:36,454 --> 03:42:38,112
MATT: 28 plus 15?

3035
03:42:38,112 --> 03:42:40,793
JOE: That's 43.

3036
03:42:40,793 --> 03:42:48,489
MATT: Ooh. 43 points of damage. So as you strike
with the first swing of the greatsword, as it

3037
03:42:48,489 --> 03:42:51,233
strikes across, it hits the side of the armor and
bones and cleaves off, no impact. But you use that

3038
03:42:51,233 --> 03:42:56,527
momentum to swing it around and jam it up towards
one of the open wounds, right where the blast in

3039
03:42:56,527 --> 03:42:59,750
the shoulder was, that Percy left earlier and was
then opened by the rest of the party. As you jam

3040
03:42:59,750 --> 03:43:04,111
it inside, you can feel the heat of the bursting
arcane energy from the inside of his body, his

3041
03:43:04,111 --> 03:43:08,976
avatar form fighting with every bit of impact and
the proximity's almost beginning to hurt your

3042
03:43:08,976 --> 03:43:11,856
face, but as you can see, a pretty decent wound.

3043
03:43:11,856 --> 03:43:16,009
MARISHA: All right. That's my turn, I guess.

3044
03:43:16,009 --> 03:43:20,256
LAURA: Oh! You have to take 4d6 radiant damage
because you hit me with a meteor shower.

3045
03:43:20,256 --> 03:43:22,062
MATT: That's true! You can roll that for me.

3046
03:43:22,062 --> 03:43:24,081
SAM: This guy's getting hurt!

3047
03:43:24,081 --> 03:43:25,650
TALIESIN: Yeah, but he keeps healing--

3048
03:43:25,650 --> 03:43:28,366
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Trammel time.

3049
03:43:28,366 --> 03:43:29,891
ASHLEY: Is he looking rough?

3050
03:43:29,891 --> 03:43:32,197
(laughter)

3051
03:43:32,197 --> 03:43:37,650
MATT: Other than those openings on his body,
doesn't look too bad. But he looks pretty rough to

3052
03:43:37,650 --> 03:43:40,836
begin with, because he's a lich. It's hard to
tell.

3053
03:43:40,836 --> 03:43:43,069
LAURA: Ten damage. Radiant damage.

3054
03:43:43,069 --> 03:43:44,785
LIAM and MARISHA: Stop. Trammel time!

3055
03:43:44,785 --> 03:43:48,526
MATT: All righty. That ends Keyleth's turn.
Percival, you're up.

3056
03:43:48,526 --> 03:43:53,727
TALIESIN: I'm in melee with this thing? I'm going
to take a shot at him with the sword. I'm going to

3057
03:43:53,727 --> 03:44:03,353
give it a swing. Well this is fine. It's my sword.
So it's a 21 to hit.

3058
03:44:03,353 --> 03:44:04,803
MATT: That hits. Go and roll damage.

3059
03:44:04,803 --> 03:44:09,349
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to drop two points
of Cabal's Ruin, or at least one point of Cabal's

3060
03:44:09,349 --> 03:44:12,493
Ruin. I want to try and end this shit.

3061
03:44:12,493 --> 03:44:14,361
MARISHA: Who are you fighting? The zombies?

3062
03:44:14,361 --> 03:44:25,178
TALIESIN: No, the birds. That's 13 points of
damage plus one lightning.

3063
03:44:25,178 --> 03:44:31,418
MATT: Okay. As you swing the sword around, you see
it bite at you and you take your hand. Using

3064
03:44:31,418 --> 03:44:36,799
Diplomacy as a gauntlet to protect you, you grab
the side of its face and push the snapping jaws to

3065
03:44:36,799 --> 03:44:42,204
the side, and using that opening, you take the
blade and slip it up into its throat and it

3066
03:44:42,204 --> 03:44:47,806
immediately collapses. You duck out of the way as
its body falls, lifeless to the ground.

3067
03:44:47,806 --> 03:44:55,795
TALIESIN: Next thing I'm going to do is take a
shot at that terrible thing over there. And I'm

3068
03:44:55,795 --> 03:45:10,790
going to burn a grit for advantage and hopefully
get it back by killing it dead. Here we go. Thank

3069
03:45:10,790 --> 03:45:18,620
god I did, because that was terrible. 25 to hit?
And I'm also going to put one more Cabal's Ruin

3070
03:45:18,620 --> 03:45:21,202
into that, just to put him down.

3071
03:45:21,202 --> 03:45:24,210
TRAVIS: It's a good system, right?

3072
03:45:24,210 --> 03:45:27,528
JOE: I'm in shock.

3073
03:45:27,528 --> 03:45:33,214
TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage, two points
of psychic damage, and two points of lightning

3074
03:45:33,214 --> 03:45:35,105
damage.

3075
03:45:35,105 --> 03:45:39,501
MATT: The second one has suffered enough damage to
be picked off, and part of its jaw gets blasted

3076
03:45:39,501 --> 03:45:44,655
off, and it melts into that liquid black
smoke-like disappearing ether.

3077
03:45:44,655 --> 03:45:52,781
TALIESIN: For my third action, oh god, I'm going
to run down a little bit. I'm going to try and get

3078
03:45:52,781 --> 03:45:54,221
three of these guys in a line.

3079
03:45:54,221 --> 03:45:55,528
MATT: Okay, so you're moving down this way?

3080
03:45:55,528 --> 03:45:59,714
TALIESIN: Just a little bit. I'm going to be one
space away. I'm not going around that way, but I'm

3081
03:45:59,714 --> 03:46:01,513
going to try to back around.

3082
03:46:01,513 --> 03:46:03,611
MATT: This way? Okay, yeah, you can move over
here.

3083
03:46:03,611 --> 03:46:06,267
TALIESIN: I don't want to get too far away,
because I'm not done with my movement. I'm trying

3084
03:46:06,267 --> 03:46:07,608
to get the shot as I run.

3085
03:46:07,608 --> 03:46:10,826
MATT: That's 20 feet, and you can fire and hit
three of these skeletons in one shot.

3086
03:46:10,826 --> 03:46:14,302
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop a grit for a line
shot. Piercing shot.

3087
03:46:14,302 --> 03:46:19,905
MARISHA: Yas, grit, yas.

3088
03:46:19,905 --> 03:46:21,307
LAURA: And then get three grits back if they die.

3089
03:46:21,307 --> 03:46:22,825
TALIESIN: I know.

3090
03:46:22,825 --> 03:46:24,895
MARISHA: Get it, son!

3091
03:46:24,895 --> 03:46:28,240
TALIESIN: That's a hit. That's 31 to hit.

3092
03:46:28,240 --> 03:46:33,598
MATT: Roll damage.

3093
03:46:33,598 --> 03:46:37,491
TALIESIN: That first one is ten points of damage
and three points of psychic.

3094
03:46:37,491 --> 03:46:40,956
MATT: That's just enough to take them out. The
first one is destroyed, and the damage is

3095
03:46:40,956 --> 03:46:42,696
maintained. Roll for the hit on the next two.

3096
03:46:42,696 --> 03:46:52,963
TALIESIN: That's 22 to hit, and then dear fucking
god.

3097
03:46:52,963 --> 03:46:54,445
LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan!

3098
03:46:54,445 --> 03:46:55,250
MATT: I know.

3099
03:46:55,250 --> 03:46:56,871
SAM: Don't worry, he's going to die in that
surround anyway.

3100
03:46:56,871 --> 03:46:58,577
MARISHA: No, shut your mouth.

3101
03:46:58,577 --> 03:46:59,791
TALIESIN: And I get all my grit back.

3102
03:46:59,791 --> 03:47:03,051
MARISHA: Which is hot.

3103
03:47:03,051 --> 03:47:07,074
JOE: You've got a little shielded person.

3104
03:47:07,074 --> 03:47:11,897
LAURA: Don't you have a healing potion left?

3105
03:47:11,897 --> 03:47:14,316
SAM: Yeah, sure. 4d4? That'll do great.

3106
03:47:14,316 --> 03:47:19,252
MATT: Final roll? This guy's also in the line.

3107
03:47:19,252 --> 03:47:24,270
TALIESIN: That was 38 to hit.

3108
03:47:24,270 --> 03:47:28,593
MATT: They all three from one shot. It goes
through their various spinal columns, causing them

3109
03:47:28,593 --> 03:47:32,867
to shatter across the stone and slide off the
side.

3110
03:47:32,867 --> 03:47:36,136
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in next to Scanlan and
as my bonus action, hand him a superior healing

3111
03:47:36,136 --> 03:47:47,645
potion. Can I not get quite there? Oh, in that
case, if I didn't have time, keep a little closer

3112
03:47:47,645 --> 03:47:50,267
to the orb.

3113
03:47:50,267 --> 03:47:52,380
MARISHA: The most expensive healing potion.

3114
03:47:52,380 --> 03:47:54,326
SAM: Is it organic?

3115
03:47:54,326 --> 03:48:00,138
TALIESIN: In that case, for my bonus, I'm going to
take a healing potion. What is a superior worth?

3116
03:48:00,138 --> 03:48:03,413
LAURA: 8d4?

3117
03:48:03,413 --> 03:48:06,027
MARISHA: 8d4 plus eight.

3118
03:48:06,027 --> 03:48:09,525
JOE: I know because I took one on the way up,
after the death knight.

3119
03:48:09,525 --> 03:48:18,591
MATT: All right, so as you're doing this,
Percival, Scanlan, you glance down and can see

3120
03:48:18,591 --> 03:48:23,950
into the city of Vasselheim, at this point. Large
columns of smoke are spilling up from the city.

3121
03:48:23,950 --> 03:48:29,522
You can see at various temples, there appear to be
various clusters of divine energies beginning to

3122
03:48:29,522 --> 03:48:35,484
emit. It looks like there are clerical groups that
are in the process of trying to conjure or find

3123
03:48:35,484 --> 03:48:42,231
ways to protect the city, but at that moment, you
can see a dozen or so angelic entities that have

3124
03:48:42,231 --> 03:48:50,322
been summoned by one of these temples swarming in
as about 25 gloomstalkers swipe in, and they begin

3125
03:48:50,322 --> 03:48:54,626
to harry each other. At that moment, you watch as
a giant arm of the titan swings upward and

3126
03:48:54,626 --> 03:49:01,466
annihilates pretty much all of them in one swing:
gloomstalkers and devas alike. All smashed and

3127
03:49:01,466 --> 03:49:07,646
scattered in one swipe of the arm, as another one
immediately with the momentum slams down into the

3128
03:49:07,646 --> 03:49:12,861
city of Vasselheim, and the whole area below
begins to shake, though you guys are currently

3129
03:49:12,861 --> 03:49:15,150
tethered by these platforms; you don't feel the
impact, but you see the city around and hear the

3130
03:49:15,150 --> 03:49:18,475
empty, echoing impact of that fist on the ground.

3131
03:49:18,475 --> 03:49:19,730
LIAM: Screams of thousands?

3132
03:49:19,730 --> 03:49:22,329
MATT: Yes. All right, that ends Percy's turn.
Scanlan, you're up.

3133
03:49:22,329 --> 03:49:23,613
SAM: I'm up?

3134
03:49:23,613 --> 03:49:24,553
MATT: Yep.

3135
03:49:24,553 --> 03:49:29,098
TALIESIN: Get some healing and stuff, boy.

3136
03:49:29,098 --> 03:49:35,240
SAM: Who's near me? Can I inspire Pike?

3137
03:49:35,240 --> 03:49:39,530
MATT: She's just in range. She's 55 feet from
you.

3138
03:49:39,530 --> 03:49:49,849
SAM: I don't know what she's planning on doing,
but I'm hoping it's something to help me. What?

3139
03:49:49,890 --> 03:49:53,223
ASHLEY: What do I get? A d4?

3140
03:49:53,223 --> 03:49:59,933
SAM: I will inspire you. I guess for my bonus, I
should take a healing potion. For my bonus, I'll

3141
03:49:59,933 --> 03:50:06,114
take a superior healing, which is what?

3142
03:50:06,114 --> 03:50:07,463
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

3143
03:50:07,463 --> 03:50:08,742
SAM: 8d4? It's too much to roll.

3144
03:50:08,742 --> 03:50:10,246
LIAM: You're carrying the football, man.

3145
03:50:10,246 --> 03:50:13,161
JOE: Nice reference.

3146
03:50:13,161 --> 03:50:21,125
LIAM: Once a year, I can do that. It takes a year
to rest.

3147
03:50:21,125 --> 03:50:24,242
JOE: Welcome to Jocks Machina.

3148
03:50:24,242 --> 03:50:25,441
SAM: 25.

3149
03:50:25,441 --> 03:50:26,547
MATT: 25 plus eight, so 33.

3150
03:50:26,547 --> 03:50:27,771
SAM: That's a lot!

3151
03:50:27,771 --> 03:50:29,277
MATT: That's your bonus?

3152
03:50:29,277 --> 03:50:30,618
SAM: You said 33?

3153
03:50:30,618 --> 03:50:31,930
LAURA: That's good!

3154
03:50:31,930 --> 03:50:34,399
SAM: What was I at before? One. I was at one.

3155
03:50:34,399 --> 03:50:35,936
MATT: Yes, you were.

3156
03:50:35,936 --> 03:50:47,040
SAM: Am I prone or anything? I'm about to get hit
by a goblin or something, aren't I?

3157
03:50:47,040 --> 03:50:51,380
TALIESIN: There are two skeletons. They'll go down
quick.

3158
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:54,518
SAM: I'll hold my action until after Pike's turn.

3159
03:50:54,518 --> 03:50:56,456
MATT: What action are you holding?

3160
03:50:56,456 --> 03:50:58,960
SAM: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, at level five.

3161
03:50:58,960 --> 03:51:01,038
MARISHA: On you?

3162
03:51:01,038 --> 03:51:02,240
SAM: On me.

3163
03:51:02,240 --> 03:51:05,521
MATT: (laughter) Okay. All righty.

3164
03:51:05,521 --> 03:51:07,106
MARISHA: Good call.

3165
03:51:07,106 --> 03:51:09,594
SAM: I have to stay alive.

3166
03:51:09,594 --> 03:51:11,002
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

3167
03:51:11,002 --> 03:51:13,353
ASHLEY: All right. Mass Cure Wounds.

3168
03:51:13,353 --> 03:51:16,241
TRAVIS: Mass Cure Wounds?

3169
03:51:16,241 --> 03:51:22,500
ASHLEY: Yes. Am I within 60 feet--

3170
03:51:22,500 --> 03:51:23,934
SAM: Who's near me?

3171
03:51:23,934 --> 03:51:25,608
ASHLEY: Percy, Scanlan, Vex?

3172
03:51:25,608 --> 03:51:35,493
MATT: Let me find out real fast here. Mass Cure
Wounds. Up to six creatures within a 30-foot

3173
03:51:35,493 --> 03:51:41,530
radius sphere within 60 feet, so you could cast
the sphere-- it's a 30-foot radius sphere, so you

3174
03:51:41,530 --> 03:51:46,611
could get yourself, Arkhan, Percival, and Scanlan
in it, if you wanted to.

3175
03:51:46,611 --> 03:51:47,849
LAURA: That's good.

3176
03:51:47,849 --> 03:51:50,197
ASHLEY: Great. Done. Doing it.

3177
03:51:50,197 --> 03:51:51,651
SAM: What's that? What do we add?

3178
03:51:51,651 --> 03:51:53,680
MATT: 3d8 plus her wisdom modifier. Plus ten.

3179
03:51:53,680 --> 03:51:54,823
SAM: She rolls.

3180
03:51:54,823 --> 03:51:56,256
MATT: Yeah, she rolls.

3181
03:51:56,256 --> 03:52:01,395
SAM: From New York. This is a 3,000 mile--

3182
03:52:01,395 --> 03:52:05,078
LAURA: In the future, you play D&amp;D across states.

3183
03:52:05,078 --> 03:52:06,476
MARISHA: Across states, yeah.

3184
03:52:06,476 --> 03:52:15,363
SAM: Is she playing with lasers because it's the
future? Remember when Mary and Will were here?

3185
03:52:15,363 --> 03:52:19,206
TRAVIS: And then they got frozen.

3186
03:52:19,206 --> 03:52:20,603
LIAM: How excited we were.

3187
03:52:20,603 --> 03:52:21,535
MATT: Sorry.

3188
03:52:21,535 --> 03:52:22,496
ASHLEY: 40 points.

3189
03:52:22,496 --> 03:52:23,352
SAM: How much?

3190
03:52:23,352 --> 03:52:25,892
ASHLEY: 40.

3191
03:52:25,892 --> 03:52:27,128
ALL: Whoa!

3192
03:52:27,128 --> 03:52:28,443
MATT: 40 points to all of you guys.

3193
03:52:28,443 --> 03:52:29,378
MARISHA: That's good.

3194
03:52:29,378 --> 03:52:38,377
SAM: My action is triggered. I'm in a ball, and
I'm pushing against it so I don't roll off the edge.

3195
03:52:38,377 --> 03:52:41,445
TALIESIN: Can you put the ball slightly into the
ground, or no?

3196
03:52:41,445 --> 03:52:43,880
SAM: I don't know. I don't know how balls work.

3197
03:52:43,880 --> 03:52:47,295
MATT: I disagree, sir.

3198
03:52:47,295 --> 03:52:51,290
TRAVIS: All the women in Exandria disagree.

3199
03:52:51,290 --> 03:52:53,835
LIAM: Not in my experience.

3200
03:52:53,835 --> 03:52:58,137
JOE: To whoever's doing my little bar at the
bottom: I came in with 111 hit points. I now have

3201
03:52:58,137 --> 03:53:03,166
151. In case you're doing this thing down here.

3202
03:53:03,166 --> 03:53:06,316
SAM: I've never seen a show. We have bars down
here?

3203
03:53:06,316 --> 03:53:11,016
ASHLEY: I still wanted to move a bit and do a
bonus.

3204
03:53:11,016 --> 03:53:14,125
LAURA: Where do you want to move, Pike?

3205
03:53:14,125 --> 03:53:24,856
ASHLEY: Could I hover on top of land? I want to
stay in the air, but hover on top of land, please.

3206
03:53:24,856 --> 03:53:26,156
MATT: Sure.

3207
03:53:26,156 --> 03:53:28,628
LAURA: You want to be right below where you were,
basically?

3208
03:53:28,628 --> 03:53:34,425
ASHLEY: I want to stay the same height, but if for
some reason I fell, there would be land. And then

3209
03:53:34,425 --> 03:53:43,844
as a bonus action, I'm going to take a superior
healing potion that I have. And that will be my turn.

3210
03:53:43,844 --> 03:53:46,929
MATT: That ends Pike's turn. That brings us back
to the top of the round, which is Vecna's turn.

3211
03:53:46,929 --> 03:54:06,297
Gets his legendary actions back. All right.

3212
03:54:06,297 --> 03:54:08,846
TALIESIN: He's still Hunter's Marked, which is
remarkable.

3213
03:54:08,846 --> 03:54:10,856
MATT: Actually, I need you to make a concentration
check.

3214
03:54:10,856 --> 03:54:13,546
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. I said that out loud.
Goddamn it.

3215
03:54:13,546 --> 03:54:17,116
LAURA: What do I add to it?

3216
03:54:17,116 --> 03:54:20,225
MATT: How much damage did you take from Meteor
Swarm?

3217
03:54:20,225 --> 03:54:27,672
LAURA: I can't remember. It was 30 plus 30 or
something. It was halves of everything.

3218
03:54:27,672 --> 03:54:30,806
MATT: So a 32, we'll say is the DC.

3219
03:54:30,806 --> 03:54:33,593
LAURA: And I add it to what, my constitution?

3220
03:54:33,593 --> 03:54:35,436
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

3221
03:54:35,436 --> 03:54:37,069
LAURA: No. 17.

3222
03:54:37,069 --> 03:54:38,271
MATT: Your Hunter's Mark is gone.

3223
03:54:38,271 --> 03:54:40,743
LAURA: You know what? It's fine.

3224
03:54:40,743 --> 03:54:42,623
MATT: Thank you for the reminder.

3225
03:54:42,623 --> 03:54:48,195
SAM: Give Matt a couple.

3226
03:54:48,195 --> 03:54:51,100
LAURA: It should have been gone.

3227
03:54:51,100 --> 03:54:59,260
SAM: Man, this fight is crazy.

3228
03:54:59,260 --> 03:55:07,722
MATT: Vecna, who is clustered in this space,
seeing the sphere appear down below, and realizing

3229
03:55:07,722 --> 03:55:13,126
the issue of the immediate vicinity, is going to
cast a 6th-level Circle of Death right in the

3230
03:55:13,126 --> 03:55:14,815
space where he's at.

3231
03:55:14,815 --> 03:55:20,689
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my reaction with Mage
Slayer to make a melee weapon attack against him.

3232
03:55:20,689 --> 03:55:28,110
And he will have disadvantage on his saving throw
to maintain his spell, if it is a concentration.

3233
03:55:28,110 --> 03:55:29,659
MATT: It isn't a concentration check.

3234
03:55:29,659 --> 03:55:32,428
LIAM: But you still get to fuck him up.

3235
03:55:32,428 --> 03:55:37,453
MATT: I need a constitution saving throw from
Keyleth, Vax, and Grog.

3236
03:55:37,453 --> 03:55:41,170
TRAVIS: And I have advantage on this.

3237
03:55:41,170 --> 03:55:42,846
MARISHA: Is this a spell, so I have advantage, as
well?

3238
03:55:42,846 --> 03:55:47,758
MATT: It's a spell, yes.

3239
03:55:47,758 --> 03:55:48,979
TRAVIS: What kind of a save?

3240
03:55:48,979 --> 03:55:50,352
MATT: It's constitution, so you would not have
advantage, technically, right?

3241
03:55:50,352 --> 03:55:57,159
TRAVIS: I have advantage because of Mage Slayer.
It finally came into effect.

3242
03:55:57,159 --> 03:56:02,861
MARISHA: 16 plus seven.

3243
03:56:02,861 --> 03:56:04,253
MATT: 23. Does not succeed.

3244
03:56:04,253 --> 03:56:06,465
MARISHA: 23 still doesn't succeed?

3245
03:56:06,465 --> 03:56:08,810
LAURA: No, it's 26 you have to succeed against.

3246
03:56:08,810 --> 03:56:14,929
TRAVIS: I rolled a 26, exactly. On the dot. Right
there.

3247
03:56:14,929 --> 03:56:21,420
LIAM: Natural 20 plus eight, so 28. I used luck to
get it.

3248
03:56:21,420 --> 03:56:26,062
MATT: Gotcha. So that's half damage. That will be
10d6.

3249
03:56:26,062 --> 03:56:29,344
TALIESIN: It's not going to be that bad.

3250
03:56:29,344 --> 03:56:41,695
MATT: That's going to be 41 points of necrotic
damage, reduced to 20 to all three of you, because

3251
03:56:41,695 --> 03:56:42,889
you saved.

3252
03:56:42,889 --> 03:56:44,223
MARISHA: I take the full 49?

3253
03:56:44,223 --> 03:56:45,815
LIAM: 41.

3254
03:56:45,815 --> 03:56:46,828
MARISHA: 41.

3255
03:56:46,828 --> 03:56:49,546
LAURA: Are you immune or resistant to necrotic as
a planetar?

3256
03:56:49,546 --> 03:56:54,623
MARISHA: No. I'm resistant to radiant.

3257
03:56:54,623 --> 03:57:04,385
TRAVIS: I'm going to make that melee attack
against him. Reckless, bitch. Oh, so close to a

3258
03:57:04,385 --> 03:57:05,807
19. Damn it!

3259
03:57:05,807 --> 03:57:16,260
LAURA and SAM: Go, Philip!

3260
03:57:16,260 --> 03:57:22,537
MARISHA: Holy shit.

3261
03:57:22,537 --> 03:57:29,274
TRAVIS: 38.

3262
03:57:29,274 --> 03:57:31,593
SAM: Liam, thanks for introducing me to Dungeons &amp;
Dragons.

3263
03:57:31,593 --> 03:57:32,820
LIAM: Do you like it?

3264
03:57:32,820 --> 03:57:34,168
SAM: I'm beginning to like it.

3265
03:57:34,168 --> 03:57:37,979
TRAVIS: I rerolled the second one because I reroll
ones and twos.

3266
03:57:37,979 --> 03:57:40,851
MATT: That ends your reaction.

3267
03:57:40,851 --> 03:57:48,838
SAM: (whispering) He doesn't know what to do.

3268
03:57:48,838 --> 03:57:53,012
TALIESIN: No, he doesn't know which of his toys to
play with.

3269
03:57:53,012 --> 03:57:59,771
JOE: (whispering) He's got so much good stuff, he
doesn't know what to do.

3270
03:57:59,771 --> 03:58:01,694
SAM: He has level ten spells.

3271
03:58:01,694 --> 03:58:08,409
MATT: All righty. You used your reaction. Doesn't
want to take another sneak attack from you. He's

3272
03:58:08,409 --> 03:58:10,767
going to stay, because you guys moved too close
right now. He's going to stay right there. He's

3273
03:58:10,767 --> 03:58:18,611
right now grinning. You can see the flame bursting
out of his left socket, the hand pulsing with

3274
03:58:18,611 --> 03:58:19,510
power.

3275
03:58:19,510 --> 03:58:20,496
SAM: Yeah, can't move.

3276
03:58:20,496 --> 03:58:22,380
LAURA: Where are we at? Whose turn is it?

3277
03:58:22,380 --> 03:58:29,705
MATT: End of Vecna's turn. You're up.

3278
03:58:29,705 --> 03:58:31,608
MARISHA: Pike, Grog, and Vax.

3279
03:58:31,608 --> 03:58:36,727
TRAVIS: Trammel round, right? Do I need to roll to
maintain my grapple?

3280
03:58:36,727 --> 03:58:38,463
MATT: No, he just needs to break the grapple.

3281
03:58:38,463 --> 03:58:40,510
LAURA: Trammel him!

3282
03:58:40,510 --> 03:58:42,988
TRAVIS: I'm going to take the trammel out of the
bag of holding.

3283
03:58:42,988 --> 03:58:49,471
MATT: That's a valid point, actually. I should
have remembered that, and I'll do this as the

3284
03:58:49,471 --> 03:58:52,027
current circumstance. Because he does have the
hand returned to him, each of you should have

3285
03:58:52,027 --> 03:58:54,927
taken 2d8 cold damage for each hit. I forgot to
mark that on the sheet.

3286
03:58:54,927 --> 03:58:57,815
LIAM: We've dropped a lot of damage, as well.

3287
03:58:57,815 --> 03:59:03,494
MARISHA: For melee? Melee hits? I got one on him.

3288
03:59:03,494 --> 03:59:13,703
MATT: That's nine points of cold damage to you,
Keyleth. We'll put you at 11 points of cold

3289
03:59:13,703 --> 03:59:20,669
damage, nine points of cold damage, and another
ten points of cold damage for you.

3290
03:59:20,669 --> 03:59:23,568
LIAM: Wait, what's the total for me? Nine, ten,
and 11 all to me? Okay.

3291
03:59:23,568 --> 03:59:27,095
MATT: And then Grog, since this is the first time
you've hit him in melee, that's been twice, so

3292
03:59:27,095 --> 03:59:32,219
that's ten points of cold damage, reduced to five,
and five reduced to two. Every single time you

3293
03:59:32,219 --> 03:59:35,889
melee hit him, you take 2d8 cold damage. That was
my fault for not remembering that.

3294
03:59:35,889 --> 03:59:37,124
LIAM: Every time we hit him.

3295
03:59:37,124 --> 03:59:38,360
MATT: Yep. In melee.

3296
03:59:38,360 --> 03:59:46,512
MARISHA: Everyone's remembering their blessings
and all the cool shit they do?

3297
03:59:46,512 --> 03:59:47,630
LAURA: Yeah.

3298
03:59:47,630 --> 03:59:50,808
MARISHA: Pike, you have a cool blessing. Is it
doing everything?

3299
03:59:50,808 --> 03:59:53,947
LAURA: She's flying.

3300
03:59:53,947 --> 03:59:55,692
MARISHA: You fly and you heal better. You're
pretty good.

3301
03:59:55,692 --> 03:59:59,773
TRAVIS: All right, we're going to kick this off.
I'll take the trammel out of the bag of holding.

3302
03:59:59,773 --> 04:00:02,920
LAURA: Do it!

3303
04:00:02,920 --> 04:00:08,241
TRAVIS: I'm going to aim for one of those green
openings and fucking try and shove that bitch in

3304
04:00:08,241 --> 04:00:09,416
his torso.

3305
04:00:09,416 --> 04:00:15,025
MATT: You have the wound there, you have the
inside of the green energy force there, and then

3306
04:00:15,025 --> 04:00:16,762
you have one on the side of the head.

3307
04:00:16,762 --> 04:00:18,762
TRAVIS: Well, I'm holding onto his rib, right? Can
I get his head?

3308
04:00:18,762 --> 04:00:21,236
MATT: You could probably climb up a bit and go for
it, because you're pretty big.

3309
04:00:21,236 --> 04:00:22,604
JOE: Muscle up.

3310
04:00:22,604 --> 04:00:25,574
TRAVIS: I do a strict muscle.

3311
04:00:25,574 --> 04:00:29,438
JOE: On an axle bar, too.

3312
04:00:29,438 --> 04:00:32,240
TRAVIS: Yeah, the thick fucker.

3313
04:00:32,240 --> 04:00:34,630
MATT: Roll a strength check.

3314
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:37,092
MARISHA: Jocks Machina.

3315
04:00:37,092 --> 04:00:40,498
MATT: You have advantage because you're raging,
yeah.

3316
04:00:40,498 --> 04:00:42,650
MARISHA: Come on, Grog.

3317
04:00:42,650 --> 04:00:48,876
TRAVIS: We're okay, kids. We're okay. It is a 20,
even.

3318
04:00:48,876 --> 04:00:52,548
MATT: 20 is the DC for applying a trammel on a
strength check.

3319
04:00:52,548 --> 04:00:56,667
TRAVIS: That shit takes years off my life, y'all.

3320
04:00:56,667 --> 04:01:00,866
MATT: It's not athletics. It's whatever your
strength modifier is.

3321
04:01:00,866 --> 04:01:03,631
TRAVIS: Just strength. Thank god for the
Titanstone Knuckles.

3322
04:01:03,631 --> 04:01:15,086
MATT: As you climb up, you pull out the trammel.
He had the Raven Queen. Who has Ioun's trammel?

3323
04:01:15,086 --> 04:01:21,723
LAURA: Pike has Ioun's. You have mine, right? And
then the Raven Queen's is the janky one.

3324
04:01:21,723 --> 04:01:28,389
MATT: Ioun didn't have a trammel. Sarenrae never
gave one. It was Ioun. Yeah, so Pike has Ioun.

3325
04:01:28,389 --> 04:01:32,224
LAURA: He has Pelor, and he has the Raven Queen.

3326
04:01:32,224 --> 04:01:39,381
MATT: As you climb up, you take the trammel, its
large, spiraling platinum form. Shout and jam it

3327
04:01:39,381 --> 04:01:43,785
as hard as you can into the opening on the side of
the head. As he turns to look at you, the flame

3328
04:01:43,785 --> 04:01:51,205
burning, the trammel pierces into the side of
Vecna's massive skull and temple. As it buries in,

3329
04:01:51,205 --> 04:01:56,726
you can feel the flames from the impact burning
around your fingers, as if the very surface of the

3330
04:01:56,726 --> 04:02:02,716
sun is threatening to burn your hand off. The pain
is extreme, but you push through it, and as you

3331
04:02:02,716 --> 04:02:08,862
jam it, you can feel it spiraling in, and you turn
it and twist. As it digs in, Vecna (roars) gives

3332
04:02:08,862 --> 04:02:13,292
out this horrible screaming yell, and as it pulls
in, you watch as the very end of it seems to glow

3333
04:02:13,292 --> 04:02:18,472
with this bright, yellowish sun-like light. It's
locked into place.

3334
04:02:18,472 --> 04:02:20,366
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3335
04:02:20,366 --> 04:02:22,355
MARISHA: Oh my god, we've started this.

3336
04:02:22,355 --> 04:02:26,216
TRAVIS: That was one. I have another attack.

3337
04:02:26,216 --> 04:02:27,660
MATT: That's your action.

3338
04:02:27,660 --> 04:02:31,484
TRAVIS: I have my hasted action. Is there any
point in hitting him?

3339
04:02:31,484 --> 04:02:33,983
SAM: Yeah, because he can heal!

3340
04:02:33,983 --> 04:02:44,346
TRAVIS: I'll make another reckless attack against
him. That's 28 to hit.

3341
04:02:44,346 --> 04:02:46,423
MATT: 28 to hit? All righty.

3342
04:02:46,423 --> 04:03:00,408
TRAVIS: (counting) 32. That's 32 points.

3343
04:03:00,408 --> 04:03:03,383
MATT: All righty.

3344
04:03:03,383 --> 04:03:09,554
TRAVIS: And I will burn my only action surge to
whale away some more.

3345
04:03:09,554 --> 04:03:11,724
MATT: Okay, go for it.

3346
04:03:11,724 --> 04:03:13,465
TRAVIS: Reckless. This is two more attacks?

3347
04:03:13,465 --> 04:03:15,654
MATT: Two more attacks.

3348
04:03:15,654 --> 04:03:22,637
TRAVIS: Damn it! Come on, fucker, hit. 33 to hit.

3349
04:03:22,637 --> 04:03:24,590
MATT: 33 hits.

3350
04:03:24,590 --> 04:03:41,078
TRAVIS: 24, 29, 36. 38 points on the first one.
Last reckless. Natural 20.

3351
04:03:41,078 --> 04:03:43,401
MATT: Jesus Christ.

3352
04:03:43,401 --> 04:03:48,227
SAM: No way. That's going to be a lot of damage.

3353
04:03:48,227 --> 04:03:51,678
TRAVIS: Just one-handed, so it's a d8. Doubled,
though.

3354
04:03:51,678 --> 04:03:54,773
MARISHA: Oh, Pike is after Scanlan.

3355
04:03:54,773 --> 04:04:03,346
TALIESIN: Scanlan can hold his action.

3356
04:04:03,346 --> 04:04:08,016
MARISHA: Scanlan could hold his action.

3357
04:04:08,016 --> 04:04:10,808
SAM: Scanlan <i>is</i> going to hold his action.

3358
04:04:10,808 --> 04:04:21,078
TRAVIS: And two damage dice. 57. 61.

3359
04:04:21,078 --> 04:04:23,412
MATT: 61?

3360
04:04:23,412 --> 04:04:29,566
TRAVIS: Not as high as the other one. There were
some low ones. Actually, that second to last one

3361
04:04:29,566 --> 04:04:33,544
was a one. That's an eight, so 68.

3362
04:04:33,544 --> 04:04:41,936
MATT: As the sword is cleaving into the side as
you're holding the trammel now for support,

3363
04:04:41,936 --> 04:04:50,540
jamming at it, you can hear the laughter in the
back of your head. "How does it feel? I will usurp

3364
04:04:50,540 --> 04:04:54,164
"you. I will take you. I will <i>be</i> you!"

3365
04:04:54,164 --> 04:04:57,290
TRAVIS: What, now?

3366
04:04:57,290 --> 04:05:00,529
SAM: That is the sound of the craziest bat house
ever.

3367
04:05:00,529 --> 04:05:02,749
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

3368
04:05:02,749 --> 04:05:10,729
MATT: That ends your turn? All right, at the end
of Grog's turn, he's going to use two legendary

3369
04:05:10,946 --> 04:05:17,489
actions here. What's everyone's hit points right
now?

3370
04:05:17,489 --> 04:05:23,144
SAM: Mine is a big fat zero around me, because I'm
protected.

3371
04:05:23,144 --> 04:05:25,275
JOE: 151.

3372
04:05:25,275 --> 04:05:26,551
TALIESIN: 88.

3373
04:05:26,551 --> 04:05:28,621
MATT: Keyleth, what's your hit points?

3374
04:05:28,621 --> 04:05:30,765
MARISHA: Currently, 81 as a planetar.

3375
04:05:30,765 --> 04:05:35,779
LIAM: I'm at 78.

3376
04:05:35,779 --> 04:05:37,326
LAURA: 70.

3377
04:05:37,326 --> 04:05:38,772
MATT: Grog?

3378
04:05:38,772 --> 04:05:40,118
TRAVIS: 197.

3379
04:05:40,118 --> 04:05:40,841
MATT: Pike?

3380
04:05:40,841 --> 04:05:42,280
ASHLEY: 106.

3381
04:05:42,280 --> 04:05:47,467
MATT: Okay. Let's see here. Yeah, let's do Finger
of Death. Why not?

3382
04:05:47,467 --> 04:05:51,553
TRAVIS: Don't be so fucking casual about it!

3383
04:05:51,553 --> 04:05:58,822
SAM: Sorry, guys. Can't save you.

3384
04:05:58,822 --> 04:06:02,031
MATT: It's going to be at Vex.

3385
04:06:02,031 --> 04:06:04,611
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.

3386
04:06:04,611 --> 04:06:06,538
TRAVIS: No.

3387
04:06:06,538 --> 04:06:13,738
LAURA: I have plus four to saves, if I have to
roll a save.

3388
04:06:13,738 --> 04:06:16,992
TRAVIS: I already used my reaction to hit him.

3389
04:06:16,992 --> 04:06:23,093
LAURA: We have advantage on saving throws.

3390
04:06:23,093 --> 04:06:27,300
MARISHA: You have Death Ward going.

3391
04:06:27,300 --> 04:06:32,561
MATT: That's going to be a constitution saving
throw, if you don't mind.

3392
04:06:32,561 --> 04:06:34,211
LAURA: Constitution.

3393
04:06:34,211 --> 04:06:36,046
ASHLEY: Come on, baby.

3394
04:06:36,046 --> 04:06:40,527
LAURA: Okay.

3395
04:06:40,527 --> 04:06:44,347
MARISHA: And you're blessed.

3396
04:06:44,347 --> 04:06:49,995
MATT: Bless is concentration, correct?

3397
04:06:49,995 --> 04:06:51,461
LIAM: Yeah.

3398
04:06:51,461 --> 04:06:54,872
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw to see if
you maintained it.

3399
04:06:54,872 --> 04:06:57,576
LIAM: 26.

3400
04:06:57,576 --> 04:07:00,224
MATT: Okay, so I'll let you do that. What did you
roll?

3401
04:07:00,224 --> 04:07:03,826
LAURA: 23.

3402
04:07:03,826 --> 04:07:10,046
MATT: 23. That does not succeed, unfortunately.
You take 64 points of necrotic damage.

3403
04:07:10,046 --> 04:07:14,259
LAURA: I'm resistant to necrotic damage because of
my blessing!

3404
04:07:14,259 --> 04:07:16,013
MATT: You are.

3405
04:07:16,013 --> 04:07:21,760
TRAVIS: You're in! Okay. You're good!

3406
04:07:21,760 --> 04:07:24,689
MATT: 32 points of damage.

3407
04:07:24,689 --> 04:07:28,101
SAM: Oh wow. That Finger of Death.

3408
04:07:28,101 --> 04:07:34,051
JOE: That was the bless, right there.

3409
04:07:34,051 --> 04:07:43,968
MATT: All right, Vex, it's your turn.

3410
04:07:43,968 --> 04:07:49,625
LAURA: I fucking hate Finger of Death!

3411
04:07:49,625 --> 04:07:52,148
SAM: It's the worst!

3412
04:07:52,148 --> 04:08:01,718
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And I'm
going to hit him! I'm going to try, at least.

3413
04:08:01,718 --> 04:08:04,251
TRAVIS: How many hit points Vecna got left?

3414
04:08:04,251 --> 04:08:10,706
LAURA: Instead of Hunter's Mark, I probably should
have taken a superior healing. I probably should

3415
04:08:10,706 --> 04:08:18,896
have done that. Yeah, can I counter? Can I
un-Hunter's Mark him and take a superior healing?

3416
04:08:18,896 --> 04:08:27,263
I already said it. It's fine if I already said it.
I said it! Okay. Fuck it, I'm going to try to

3417
04:08:27,263 --> 04:08:30,511
sharpshooter him, because everybody's up there.

3418
04:08:30,511 --> 04:08:33,493
SAM: Come on, ranger. Be a ranger.

3419
04:08:33,493 --> 04:08:44,059
LAURA: 31 plus three is 34, minus five to hit.

3420
04:08:44,059 --> 04:08:48,514
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage. Vax, you're up
next.

3421
04:08:48,514 --> 04:08:53,599
LAURA: Oh, and I get sneak attack because there's
a bunch of people on him. Okay.

3422
04:08:53,599 --> 04:08:59,579
SAM: Responsibility?

3423
04:08:59,579 --> 04:09:06,019
LIAM: Don't worry about it.

3424
04:09:06,019 --> 04:09:10,103
SAM: What responsibility? We're all carefree Joes
and Jills here, right?

3425
04:09:10,103 --> 04:09:16,545
TRAVIS: Do you want to talk to Vecna about maybe
melee hitting me?

3426
04:09:16,545 --> 04:09:20,314
LAURA: 39 damage.

3427
04:09:20,314 --> 04:09:23,340
MATT: That's your first arrow?

3428
04:09:23,340 --> 04:09:26,210
LAURA: That's my first arrow, and I'm going to try
to do the same thing again.

3429
04:09:26,210 --> 04:09:28,869
TALIESIN: He takes radiant damage when he hits Vex
now.

3430
04:09:28,869 --> 04:09:41,815
LAURA: He does take 4d6. Thank you. 13 points of
radiant damage. And I'm going to try to hit him

3431
04:09:41,815 --> 04:09:53,329
again with sharpshooter. 28. I moved that. I'm
going to roll it again, because I didn't see what

3432
04:09:53,329 --> 04:09:58,835
it was. 29 minus five is 24 to hit?

3433
04:09:58,835 --> 04:10:00,468
MATT: Okay.

3434
04:10:00,468 --> 04:10:05,253
LAURA: That's cocked.

3435
04:10:05,253 --> 04:10:22,178
JOE: Shout out to John Castle for winning the dead
pool backstage. He guessed Scanlan Two correctly.

3436
04:10:22,178 --> 04:10:30,554
LIAM: Question for the DM: Before, when I was
watching him shove the Pelor trammel in, did it look

3437
04:10:30,554 --> 04:10:33,762
like it took a lot of muscle, specifically, to get
it in there?

3438
04:10:33,762 --> 04:10:37,489
MATT: Make a perception check.

3439
04:10:37,489 --> 04:10:49,601
LAURA: 18 was the second attack damage. And I'm
going to hop on my broom. I'm already on my broom.

3440
04:10:49,601 --> 04:10:59,137
I'm going to fly so I can get closer. I'll hover
here. I want to be closer to Pike. Is it possible

3441
04:10:59,137 --> 04:11:01,096
to get across to the other side?

3442
04:11:01,096 --> 04:11:05,913
MATT: You can move 50 feet on the broom, so you
can get about here. You won't be able to get all

3443
04:11:05,913 --> 04:11:07,377
the way over.

3444
04:11:07,377 --> 04:11:14,062
LAURA: Could I get here? Am I within range of
Pike, then? 60 feet? I'm higher than I would be.

3445
04:11:14,062 --> 04:11:18,564
MATT: You can try. You can coast to about here.

3446
04:11:18,564 --> 04:11:22,667
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to be about that height,
but I want to be over the edge.

3447
04:11:22,667 --> 04:11:28,243
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Vex?

3448
04:11:28,243 --> 04:11:29,900
LAURA: Yeah!

3449
04:11:29,900 --> 04:11:39,767
MATT: All righty. Let's see here. He's going to
spend two points to cast another spell.

3450
04:11:39,767 --> 04:11:43,633
TRAVIS: He's used four this round.

3451
04:11:43,633 --> 04:11:46,095
LAURA: Who did Arkhan come in after?

3452
04:11:46,095 --> 04:11:47,908
TRAVIS: Vax.

3453
04:11:47,908 --> 04:11:50,494
LAURA: Did we skip your turn the last time?

3454
04:11:50,494 --> 04:11:52,622
JOE: I had to move.

3455
04:11:52,622 --> 04:11:56,102
SAM: Is J'mon doing macrame in there?

3456
04:11:56,102 --> 04:12:00,708
MATT: J'mon is trying to find a way, or hoping for
an exit from here.

3457
04:12:00,708 --> 04:12:04,095
LAURA: Raging for 12 seconds, really.

3458
04:12:04,095 --> 04:12:19,898
MATT: He's going to cast Disintegrate down onto
your orb, Scanlan.

3459
04:12:19,898 --> 04:12:22,416
SAM: Don't worry, it can resist anything!

3460
04:12:22,416 --> 04:12:24,849
MATT: Except for Disintegrate.

3461
04:12:24,849 --> 04:12:26,752
SAM: (screams)

3462
04:12:26,752 --> 04:12:29,673
TRAVIS: And there it goes, just like that.

3463
04:12:29,673 --> 04:12:32,341
MATT: The sphere dissipates around Scanlan.

3464
04:12:32,341 --> 04:12:33,901
SAM: I feel so naked.

3465
04:12:33,901 --> 04:12:36,183
TRAVIS: What level spell was that?

3466
04:12:36,183 --> 04:12:39,823
MATT: Disintegrate was a 6th-level.

3467
04:12:39,823 --> 04:12:43,229
SAM: Great. Burn those spells.

3468
04:12:43,229 --> 04:12:45,481
TRAVIS: He's got a bunch more.

3469
04:12:45,481 --> 04:12:47,576
MATT: That brings us to Vax.

3470
04:12:47,576 --> 04:12:50,315
MARISHA: Goddamn. I don't know what to do, man.

3471
04:12:50,315 --> 04:12:58,946
LIAM: I pull out the trammel. Do you have a free
hand? Or a belt? Yeah, you've got a belt.

3472
04:12:58,946 --> 04:13:01,426
TRAVIS: Do I have a free hand?

3473
04:13:01,426 --> 04:13:02,903
LAURA: Your hand would be open.

3474
04:13:02,903 --> 04:13:05,242
MATT: You had the sword out right now in the other
hand.

3475
04:13:05,242 --> 04:13:09,972
LIAM: So no free hand. Can I use the hasted action
to shove my trammel into his belt?

3476
04:13:09,972 --> 04:13:11,851
LAURA: Or into the bag of holding?

3477
04:13:11,851 --> 04:13:13,034
LIAM: Or anywhere?

3478
04:13:13,034 --> 04:13:14,982
MATT: I'll let you do that as a hasted action.

3479
04:13:14,982 --> 04:13:20,232
LIAM: The Raven Queen's trammel. I did a
perception check and got a 28.

3480
04:13:20,232 --> 04:13:24,053
MATT: You did see, it was a fair amount of
strength it entailed to apply.

3481
04:13:24,053 --> 04:13:38,517
LIAM: Yeah. And then I'm going to-- (sighs) fuck,
I'm going to get in his face again and use paladin

3482
04:13:38,517 --> 04:13:56,269
attack-attack. That's 29 to hit, the first. Keep
him hurting. (counting)

3483
04:13:56,269 --> 04:14:00,400
TRAVIS: Scanlan, how's your athletics?

3484
04:14:00,400 --> 04:14:18,825
LIAM: 33 for the first attack. Second attack is a
21, so I think that misses. And then I've got a

3485
04:14:18,825 --> 04:14:25,001
bonus action left. I'm going to stay where I am,
and I have a regular healing potion. I'm going to

3486
04:14:25,001 --> 04:14:28,526
down that. That's 4d4 plus four, right?

3487
04:14:28,526 --> 04:14:42,163
MATT: All righty. At the end of your turn, he's
going to use his fifth and final legendary action

3488
04:14:42,163 --> 04:14:49,791
to cast Firebolt at Scanlan again. That is a 34.

3489
04:14:49,791 --> 04:14:53,180
SAM: I take off my hat and gladly accept the
fire.

3490
04:14:53,180 --> 04:14:58,817
MATT: 22 points of fire damage.

3491
04:14:58,817 --> 04:15:04,207
MARISHA: Can we survive one more round? Because if
not, I can grab that thing from your belt and try

3492
04:15:04,207 --> 04:15:08,203
to go for it, Pike can get there in time, and he
can do the thing.

3493
04:15:08,203 --> 04:15:10,074
TALIESIN: Are you okay?

3494
04:15:10,074 --> 04:15:11,136
SAM: I'm alive.

3495
04:15:11,136 --> 04:15:12,738
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3496
04:15:12,738 --> 04:15:16,516
MARISHA: If not, we try and survive one more round
for you to get it in. I'm nervous I'm going to

3497
04:15:16,516 --> 04:15:18,048
fuck this thing up.

3498
04:15:18,048 --> 04:15:19,964
TRAVIS: Are you going to try to do this now?

3499
04:15:19,964 --> 04:15:23,576
MARISHA: I've got plus seven to my strength. I've
got to roll 13 or higher.

3500
04:15:23,576 --> 04:15:25,540
TRAVIS: Mine is plus eight.

3501
04:15:25,540 --> 04:15:28,796
MARISHA: But he gets advantage.

3502
04:15:28,796 --> 04:15:41,575
MATT: Vax, is that the end of your turn? That
brings us to the 20th count. The stones are going

3503
04:15:41,575 --> 04:15:43,191
to shift.

3504
04:15:43,191 --> 04:15:45,450
LAURA: Oh no, it's moving again!

3505
04:15:45,450 --> 04:15:47,979
MARISHA: Strength checks?

3506
04:15:47,979 --> 04:15:53,818
TALIESIN: Strength modifier.

3507
04:15:53,818 --> 04:15:59,874
JOE: I'm even on strength checks, I think.

3508
04:15:59,874 --> 04:16:08,368
SAM: Who moved? Oh, the stones moved?

3509
04:16:08,368 --> 04:16:11,816
MATT: The tendrils are still holding them in place
as they're slowly rotating and shifting around the

3510
04:16:11,816 --> 04:16:15,821
battlefield. Skeletons are going to both attack
you, Scanlan.

3511
04:16:15,821 --> 04:16:17,713
SAM: Sure, man. Bring it.

3512
04:16:17,713 --> 04:16:23,987
MATT: That is a 14, so you take seven points of
slashing damage. And that is a natural 19, so you

3513
04:16:23,987 --> 04:16:26,134
take another seven points of slashing damage. 14
total.

3514
04:16:26,134 --> 04:16:29,814
TALIESIN: That's the end of those skeletons,
though. They're about to go away.

3515
04:16:29,814 --> 04:16:33,072
MATT: All righty. Arkhan, your turn.

3516
04:16:33,072 --> 04:16:36,042
JOE: I fly straight up into this motherfucker.

3517
04:16:36,042 --> 04:16:38,080
SAM: Yes, Arkhan!

3518
04:16:38,080 --> 04:16:41,901
JOE: My magical dragon wings.

3519
04:16:41,901 --> 04:16:44,846
SAM: I was a guest at Archon once. Pretty good
convention.

3520
04:16:44,846 --> 04:16:46,545
TALIESIN: St. Louis, right?

3521
04:16:46,545 --> 04:16:55,039
JOE: It's nice that they named a convention after
me. Great. I'm going to strike with Fane-Eater.

3522
04:16:55,039 --> 04:16:56,846
MATT: Okay.

3523
04:16:56,846 --> 04:17:02,480
SAM: Okay. You're strong.

3524
04:17:02,480 --> 04:17:03,770
JOE: 23.

3525
04:17:03,770 --> 04:17:06,402
MATT: 23 just hits.

3526
04:17:06,402 --> 04:17:09,177
TRAVIS: AC is 23.

3527
04:17:09,177 --> 04:17:20,290
JOE: I only have a few 1st-level spells. I'm
pumping a 1st-level divine smite, so we're going

3528
04:17:20,290 --> 04:17:31,172
2d8 for level one, 1d8 for undead. Okay. 2d8 for
my axe.

3529
04:17:31,172 --> 04:17:34,134
MATT: You guys are keeping these other wounds from
sealing up.

3530
04:17:34,134 --> 04:17:38,228
LIAM: We are picking his scabs.

3531
04:17:38,228 --> 04:17:44,806
SAM: When Grog attacked with the trammel, it was a
strength check?

3532
04:17:44,806 --> 04:17:46,724
MATT: Yes.

3533
04:17:46,724 --> 04:17:56,777
JOE: 37 points of damage. Strike number two.
Natural 20!

3534
04:17:56,777 --> 04:17:59,234
(cheering)

3535
04:17:59,234 --> 04:18:00,793
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah!

3536
04:18:00,793 --> 04:18:08,556
JOE: Fuck yes. I've wanted to crit with this axe
so bad. Great. On a crit, I roll an extra 2d8 that

3537
04:18:08,556 --> 04:18:18,221
are necrotic, but whatever. We can use anything we
can get. I will pump another 1st-level smite into

3538
04:18:18,221 --> 04:18:25,908
that one, so it's going to be 5d8 plus 2d8
necrotic.

3539
04:18:25,908 --> 04:18:33,575
LIAM: I'd like to point out that we have two
barbarians and two paladins up here right now.

3540
04:18:33,575 --> 04:18:36,464
SAM: We had two bards.

3541
04:18:36,464 --> 04:18:44,049
JOE: Does the necrotic double? Because it's double
all dice?

3542
04:18:44,049 --> 04:18:49,756
MATT: Oh, for the critical? The dice would, as
well.

3543
04:18:49,756 --> 04:18:53,042
JOE: The dice would, as well. Okay, great. All
right.

3544
04:18:53,042 --> 04:19:07,108
SAM: What do you think? It looks close. I don't
know, though.

3545
04:19:07,108 --> 04:19:13,709
JOE: 50, plus five points of necrotic, which
doubles to ten.

3546
04:19:13,709 --> 04:19:18,206
MATT: Brings it back down to five. He is resistant
to necrotic damage, so each of these necrotic hits

3547
04:19:18,206 --> 04:19:21,909
are doing less damage. Nevertheless, it's still 55
points of damage in one crit hit, which is

3548
04:19:21,909 --> 04:19:23,145
awesome.

3549
04:19:23,145 --> 04:19:24,711
JOE: That was radiant mixed with slashing.

3550
04:19:24,711 --> 04:19:26,345
MATT: Right. The rest of it went through fine.

3551
04:19:26,345 --> 04:19:41,707
JOE: The ten goes down to five. Okay, great. Okay,
for my final trick, I am frenzied. That's going to

3552
04:19:41,707 --> 04:19:43,505
be good. That's going to be a 29.

3553
04:19:43,505 --> 04:19:45,209
MATT: 29 hits. Roll damage.

3554
04:19:45,209 --> 04:20:00,471
JOE: I will spend my third and final 1st-level
smite. (sighs) Let's go. Not bad.

3555
04:20:00,471 --> 04:20:04,113
MATT: Keyleth, you're up next, by the way.

3556
04:20:04,113 --> 04:20:10,736
MARISHA: (nervous laughter) I know. Ugh, my
deodorant wore off a little bit ago.

3557
04:20:10,736 --> 04:20:13,219
JOE: 43.

3558
04:20:13,219 --> 04:20:14,933
MATT: 43?

3559
04:20:14,933 --> 04:20:18,822
JOE: So what was that, 43 plus 55? What was the
first hit?

3560
04:20:18,822 --> 04:20:20,695
MATT: First hit was 37.

3561
04:20:20,695 --> 04:20:22,089
JOE: 37?

3562
04:20:22,089 --> 04:20:24,389
MATT: Not a bad round.

3563
04:20:24,389 --> 04:20:27,319
TRAVIS: Dude, that axe is nasty.

3564
04:20:27,319 --> 04:20:32,947
JOE: 135. That's my biggest round. That was 135.

3565
04:20:32,947 --> 04:20:34,515
SAM: Triple digits?

3566
04:20:34,515 --> 04:20:37,942
TRAVIS: That has only happened a handful of times
on this show.

3567
04:20:37,942 --> 04:20:39,472
JOE: 1st-level smites.

3568
04:20:39,472 --> 04:20:41,357
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

3569
04:20:41,357 --> 04:20:49,003
MATT: A little bit of reduction because of the
necrotic, but still pretty fucking nasty. Ending

3570
04:20:49,003 --> 04:20:51,144
Arkhan's turn, that brings us to Keyleth.

3571
04:20:51,144 --> 04:20:55,709
MARISHA: Am I taking yours, Grog? Are we going to
try this?

3572
04:20:55,709 --> 04:20:57,408
LAURA: Do it.

3573
04:20:57,408 --> 04:21:08,231
MARISHA: Okay. All right. I reach over into Grog's
belt, grab out the trammel, and the hole that's

3574
04:21:08,231 --> 04:21:09,756
there--

3575
04:21:09,756 --> 04:21:13,262
MATT: Which one? You have the shoulder or the
inside of the belly.

3576
04:21:13,262 --> 04:21:16,895
MARISHA: I was working at the one on the shoulder,
so I'm going to go for the one I've been working

3577
04:21:16,895 --> 04:21:25,029
on. Rappel over, grab it, and then rappel back
in.

3578
04:21:25,029 --> 04:21:26,342
MATT: Okay.

3579
04:21:26,342 --> 04:21:35,180
JOE: I regain an equal amount of hit points off a
crit with Fane-Eater. How many hit points did I get

3580
04:21:35,180 --> 04:21:37,085
back?

3581
04:21:37,085 --> 04:21:38,239
MATT: Five.

3582
04:21:38,239 --> 04:21:40,355
JOE: It would have been ten.

3583
04:21:40,355 --> 04:21:42,092
MATT: Because it was resisted, you only did five
damage.

3584
04:21:42,092 --> 04:21:45,340
JOE: So I get five back. Ooh, so I suck a little
bit of his soul out.

3585
04:21:45,340 --> 04:21:57,249
MATT: You pull the trammel out. This is the
somewhat-damaged.

3586
04:21:57,249 --> 04:21:59,233
SAM: Oh shit, Marisha's trying for this one?

3587
04:21:59,233 --> 04:22:08,910
MARISHA: Here's the thing. Either we do this and
we try and get all of them in, and then you get it

3588
04:22:08,910 --> 04:22:17,329
at the end of your round, or else we've got one
more round. Oh my god. I hate this so much!

3589
04:22:17,329 --> 04:22:19,408
TALIESIN: Close your eyes and roll.

3590
04:22:19,408 --> 04:22:28,424
MATT: This spiral-crafted spike, the trammel of
the Raven Queen. Your wings unfurl, and you arc

3591
04:22:28,424 --> 04:22:32,462
over back to the shoulder where you had already
dug your blade in. You can see the bursts of green

3592
04:22:32,462 --> 04:22:36,850
arcane energy and life force of the avatar form
bursting outwards. You pull back with the trammel.

3593
04:22:36,850 --> 04:22:38,976
Roll your strength check.

3594
04:22:38,976 --> 04:22:43,964
MARISHA: Do you want to give me one of your dice?
It's your trammel. One of your die?

3595
04:22:43,964 --> 04:22:45,595
LIAM: One of my die?

3596
04:22:45,595 --> 04:22:48,321
TRAVIS: You're going to go with somebody else's
die for it?

3597
04:22:48,321 --> 04:22:50,075
JOE: Listen, what are you feeling right now?

3598
04:22:50,075 --> 04:22:52,083
LAURA: Whatever you do, add your d4.

3599
04:22:52,083 --> 04:22:54,036
MARISHA: Is it a d4? Is it an attack?

3600
04:22:54,036 --> 04:22:57,137
MATT: This is an ability check.

3601
04:22:57,137 --> 04:22:58,710
LAURA: Never mind.

3602
04:22:58,710 --> 04:23:03,843
LIAM: I feel like my luck is tied up with the
existence of the world, so could I give her one of

3603
04:23:03,843 --> 04:23:05,112
my lucks?

3604
04:23:05,112 --> 04:23:11,218
MARISHA: Oh my god. I turn, and grabbing Vax's
die, I look over my shoulder at him.

3605
04:23:11,218 --> 04:23:15,483
TALIESIN: This got weird.

3606
04:23:15,483 --> 04:23:18,264
MARISHA: Oh my god. I hate this so much.

3607
04:23:18,264 --> 04:23:20,122
SAM: It's a critical roll.

3608
04:23:20,122 --> 04:23:21,989
(groaning)

3609
04:23:21,989 --> 04:23:23,367
LAURA: Oh no.

3610
04:23:23,367 --> 04:23:24,353
MATT: What was it?

3611
04:23:24,353 --> 04:23:26,592
MARISHA: A three, so ten.

3612
04:23:26,592 --> 04:23:33,439
MATT: Unfortunately, as you reach back and attempt
to jam it into the space, Vecna's body shifts just

3613
04:23:33,439 --> 04:23:38,726
out of place, and as the trammel smacks into the
shoulder and armor, you hear this terrible

3614
04:23:38,726 --> 04:23:41,127
shattering sound as the trammel--

3615
04:23:41,127 --> 04:23:44,189
SAM: Even with the plus four? No.

3616
04:23:44,189 --> 04:23:48,141
MATT: It breaks in your hand. You're one trammel
down. I'm so sorry.

3617
04:23:48,141 --> 04:23:50,113
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: It's okay.

3618
04:23:50,113 --> 04:23:53,908
LIAM: She barely even gave that shit to me. Keep
going!

3619
04:23:53,908 --> 04:23:57,977
JOE: How many do you need?

3620
04:23:57,977 --> 04:24:00,191
TALIESIN: We don't know. The more, the better.

3621
04:24:00,191 --> 04:24:02,347
SAM: We're down to one.

3622
04:24:02,347 --> 04:24:05,685
MARISHA: If we get two in, he has a 50-50 shot.

3623
04:24:05,685 --> 04:24:09,657
LAURA: She might be able to pass it to Grog, too.

3624
04:24:09,657 --> 04:24:16,319
TALIESIN: She's got a high strength. But we want
to try to end the round.

3625
04:24:16,319 --> 04:24:19,130
MATT: That's how the dice roll. It's all good.

3626
04:24:19,130 --> 04:24:23,259
SAM: Bonus action. Do you want to do anything? Do
you want to heal?

3627
04:24:23,259 --> 04:24:24,984
MATT: Bonus action or movement?

3628
04:24:24,984 --> 04:24:31,643
MARISHA: Bonus action. I'm a planetar. I don't
have bonus actions.

3629
04:24:31,643 --> 04:24:34,633
MATT: Okay, then that's the end of Keyleth's turn.
Percy, you're up.

3630
04:24:34,633 --> 04:24:41,023
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a step to my left, and
I'm going to drop a grit and I'm going to take a

3631
04:24:41,023 --> 04:24:51,722
line shot at those two skeletons and make them go
the fuck away. That's a 27 to hit.

3632
04:24:51,722 --> 04:24:54,221
MATT: That hits. Roll damage, and then roll for
the second one.

3633
04:24:54,221 --> 04:25:01,035
TALIESIN: That'll do. 15 points of damage plus
five psychic.

3634
04:25:01,035 --> 04:25:04,539
MATT: All right. He is disintegrated, and then
roll for the second one.

3635
04:25:04,539 --> 04:25:06,354
TALIESIN: That's an 18?

3636
04:25:06,354 --> 04:25:13,335
MATT: 18? You can't misfire on the others. It
still hits. Both are destroyed.

3637
04:25:13,335 --> 04:25:26,116
TALIESIN: Okay. And I get my grit back. So I'm now
going to back up against the wall. All we can do

3638
04:25:26,116 --> 04:25:30,155
at this point is take two more shots at Vecna.

3639
04:25:30,155 --> 04:25:35,215
MATT: As you're starting to figure out here, what
the damage pressure does is it reduces the DC

3640
04:25:35,215 --> 04:25:37,223
required to apply the trammel.

3641
04:25:37,223 --> 04:25:39,670
TRAVIS: The damage pressure?

3642
04:25:39,670 --> 04:25:46,289
MATT: Meaning the damage you guys put on prevents
the trammel DC from climbing up.

3643
04:25:46,289 --> 04:25:48,275
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

3644
04:25:48,275 --> 04:25:54,760
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take another shot. I'm
burning some grit for advantage, and I'm taking a

3645
04:25:54,760 --> 04:26:04,242
sharpshooter shot. Shot number one. Natural 20!
That'll hit. And let's double that up. Where's my

3646
04:26:04,242 --> 04:26:23,317
d10? Where's my d6? That'll do. That's nice.
That's (counting) 31 points of damage plus three

3647
04:26:23,317 --> 04:26:28,322
points of psychic damage, so that's 34, plus he's
going to have a bleed next round.

3648
04:26:28,322 --> 04:26:29,525
MATT: Correct.

3649
04:26:29,525 --> 04:26:35,220
TALIESIN: And I get a grit back, and I'm burning
my other grit for another shot.

3650
04:26:35,220 --> 04:26:38,366
MATT: Go for it.

3651
04:26:38,366 --> 04:26:40,279
TALIESIN: And yeah, that's another crit!

3652
04:26:40,279 --> 04:26:41,359
MATT: 19?

3653
04:26:41,359 --> 04:26:53,446
TALIESIN: 19. And that's not quite as good, but
that'll do. 26 points of damage plus five psychic

3654
04:26:53,446 --> 04:27:02,522
damage, which he'll also get half of that bleed
next round. And I get my grit back. And I'm going

3655
04:27:02,522 --> 04:27:05,465
to use my bonus to finally reload, because that
was everything I had!

3656
04:27:05,465 --> 04:27:08,502
MATT: Gun is reloaded. That finishes Percival's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

3657
04:27:08,502 --> 04:27:13,058
SAM: Bigby's Hand.

3658
04:27:13,058 --> 04:27:17,297
MARISHA: Wait, you're not going to hold your
turn?

3659
04:27:17,297 --> 04:27:24,461
SAM: Bigby's Hand, level five. Lift me up, inspire
Grog. That's it.

3660
04:27:24,461 --> 04:27:26,618
MARISHA: And then you'll hold your action?

3661
04:27:26,618 --> 04:27:28,121
SAM: That's my action.

3662
04:27:28,121 --> 04:27:30,096
MATT: It's going to carry you up. There you go.

3663
04:27:30,096 --> 04:27:34,748
MARISHA: I thought you were going to hold your
action so you could read the book after Pike did

3664
04:27:34,748 --> 04:27:36,175
the trammel?

3665
04:27:36,175 --> 04:27:39,085
MATT: It's too late now.

3666
04:27:39,085 --> 04:27:42,146
SAM: We need to get the last trammel in.

3667
04:27:42,146 --> 04:27:44,594
MARISHA: I would have given Grog the trammel,
dude!

3668
04:27:44,594 --> 04:27:47,315
TRAVIS: We're not sure if Pike's going to make
it.

3669
04:27:47,315 --> 04:27:50,039
LAURA: Yeah, he might have to do Pike's, too.

3670
04:27:50,039 --> 04:27:53,303
MATT: What are you doing?

3671
04:27:53,303 --> 04:28:00,089
SAM: I'm going to go up near Pike, and I'm going
to inspire Grog. That's it.

3672
04:28:00,089 --> 04:28:02,079
MATT: How do you inspire him?

3673
04:28:02,079 --> 04:28:04,737
TRAVIS: Do the Taylor Swift song.

3674
04:28:04,737 --> 04:28:19,789
SAM: I'm going to sing: (singing) Sunday, Monday,
Sarenrae! Tuesday, Wednesday, Sarenrae! Thursday,

3675
04:28:19,789 --> 04:28:27,171
Friday, Sarenrae! Sarenrae! She's my bae! Praying
all week for you!

3676
04:28:27,171 --> 04:28:35,651
MATT: Take your d12 for that, man! All right,
Scanlan, that end your turn? All right, that

3677
04:28:35,651 --> 04:28:37,572
brings us to Pike. Your turn.

3678
04:28:37,572 --> 04:28:41,959
ASHLEY: Okay, how far am I from my best pal Grog?

3679
04:28:41,959 --> 04:28:50,839
MATT: You are about 55, 60 feet from him.

3680
04:28:50,839 --> 04:28:53,008
ASHLEY: Can I get to him?

3681
04:28:53,008 --> 04:28:57,909
MATT: Not with your fly speed of 40, no. You can
get to him, but it'll be both your move and action

3682
04:28:57,909 --> 04:29:02,707
this turn.

3683
04:29:02,707 --> 04:29:06,588
ASHLEY: Fuck. Can I also pass him something when
I'm there?

3684
04:29:06,588 --> 04:29:08,352
LIAM: You can hold it out to him.

3685
04:29:08,352 --> 04:29:17,994
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so I'm going to fly up as far
as I can. I'm going to hold out the trammel and

3686
04:29:17,994 --> 04:29:19,964
stick it-- what? No?

3687
04:29:19,964 --> 04:29:21,675
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're good.

3688
04:29:21,675 --> 04:29:24,148
LAURA: It's just that Vecna gets to go between
us.

3689
04:29:24,148 --> 04:29:28,138
JOE: That one in the middle's about to topple over
if you don't push it.

3690
04:29:28,138 --> 04:29:31,049
TALIESIN: Got to give a little pressure.

3691
04:29:31,049 --> 04:29:37,493
MATT: We'll say for you, Pike, you're about ten
feet below Grog. Keep that in mind.

3692
04:29:37,493 --> 04:29:40,904
TRAVIS: If she double dashes?

3693
04:29:40,904 --> 04:29:49,009
MATT: Oh, a double dash? Oh, then you're right
there. Never mind. So you are good. There you go.

3694
04:29:49,009 --> 04:29:50,508
SAM: Relay race.

3695
04:29:50,508 --> 04:29:53,940
MATT: All righty. So that's your turn, Pike?

3696
04:29:53,940 --> 04:29:56,076
ASHLEY: Yeah. That's all I can do, right?

3697
04:29:56,076 --> 04:30:00,083
MATT: You have movement, movement, and you have a
bonus if you wanted to do something.

3698
04:30:00,083 --> 04:30:03,617
ASHLEY: Can I hand him the trammel?

3699
04:30:03,617 --> 04:30:05,339
MATT: Not as a bonus action, no.

3700
04:30:05,339 --> 04:30:14,538
ASHLEY: Fuck. Okay, I will also cast Guidance on
Grog.

3701
04:30:14,538 --> 04:30:16,266
MATT: Okay.

3702
04:30:16,266 --> 04:30:20,021
TRAVIS: What's that?

3703
04:30:20,021 --> 04:30:25,460
LIAM: That's key. That's great. It'll buff you a
little bit on your strength check.

3704
04:30:25,460 --> 04:30:27,616
ASHLEY: Before the spell ends, a target can roll a
d4.

3705
04:30:27,616 --> 04:30:29,071
LIAM: d4 on a skill check.

3706
04:30:29,071 --> 04:30:30,744
ASHLEY: Add the roll to one ability check.

3707
04:30:30,744 --> 04:30:35,172
MATT: All right, that end your turn, Pike?

3708
04:30:35,172 --> 04:30:36,812
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3709
04:30:36,812 --> 04:30:43,188
MATT: All right. End of the round, Vecna gets his
legendary actions back. Grog, Haste fades from

3710
04:30:43,188 --> 04:30:51,017
you. As the spell fades, you feel your muscles
lock up, and your entire body is currently stunned

3711
04:30:51,017 --> 04:30:58,368
for the next round. That's what happens when the
Haste spell ends. So as you're clutching, your

3712
04:30:58,368 --> 04:31:03,028
muscles lock up, and you're still holding onto the
trammel, but your entire body is locked up as

3713
04:31:03,028 --> 04:31:07,074
exhaustion takes over, and you're basically having
to hold yourself there in place.

3714
04:31:07,074 --> 04:31:12,189
JOE: Hold your action. Pick something good and
hold it.

3715
04:31:12,189 --> 04:31:22,005
MATT: Vecna is going to cast, with his last
7th-level spell, a 7th-level Banishment spell. I

3716
04:31:22,005 --> 04:31:32,208
would like both Pike and Grog to make charisma
saving throws, please.

3717
04:31:32,208 --> 04:31:35,875
SAM: Oh, but I Counterspelled it at 8th-level.
Ooh!

3718
04:31:35,875 --> 04:31:43,258
(laughter)

3719
04:31:43,258 --> 04:31:45,257
SAM: That's why I got closer, motherfucker!

3720
04:31:45,257 --> 04:31:50,589
(laughter and applause)

3721
04:31:50,589 --> 04:31:54,881
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3722
04:31:54,881 --> 04:32:07,492
LIAM: Oh shit. Now I am the master.

3723
04:32:07,492 --> 04:32:12,706
MATT: Oh, well done. So as the Banishment spell
fizzles in place--

3724
04:32:12,706 --> 04:32:16,603
TRAVIS: You are a steely-eyed motherfucker, man.

3725
04:32:16,603 --> 04:32:18,134
JOE: That was clutch.

3726
04:32:18,134 --> 04:32:24,239
MATT: Vecna glares right in your direction.

3727
04:32:24,239 --> 04:32:26,463
MARISHA: Oh my god, Scanlan.

3728
04:32:26,463 --> 04:32:38,662
MATT: All right. No words, just seething hatred in
your path. That's going to end Vecna's turn. Grog,

3729
04:32:38,662 --> 04:32:40,089
you're up.

3730
04:32:40,089 --> 04:32:45,305
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold my action until I can
move.

3731
04:32:45,305 --> 04:32:47,818
MATT: Your stun fades, but that's your turn.

3732
04:32:47,818 --> 04:32:53,323
ASHLEY: Wait, would stun be affected by Freedom of
Movement? Or vice versa?

3733
04:32:53,323 --> 04:32:54,628
MATT: What's up?

3734
04:32:54,628 --> 04:32:57,069
TALIESIN: Freedom of Movement would not have.

3735
04:32:57,069 --> 04:33:05,298
TRAVIS: Yeah. I guess I'm straight-up stunned,
huh? Can't move or take actions until its next

3736
04:33:05,298 --> 04:33:11,004
turn. I can't move or take actions until my next
turn.

3737
04:33:11,004 --> 04:33:21,538
MATT: Yeah, he loses his whole turn. At the end of
Grog's turn, he'll use two legendary actions. He's

3738
04:33:21,538 --> 04:33:25,436
going to cast, through the Hand of Vecna--

3739
04:33:25,436 --> 04:33:29,281
LIAM: Mass Cure Wounds.

3740
04:33:29,281 --> 04:33:33,883
MATT: He's starting to run low on high-level spell
slots. You guys have been running him ragged!

3741
04:33:33,883 --> 04:33:40,197
TRAVIS: Oh, he doesn't have another 9th-level
Meteor Strike? Another 12th-level Halley's Comet?

3742
04:33:40,197 --> 04:33:43,066
TALIESIN: 7th-level's something fierce, though.

3743
04:33:43,066 --> 04:33:45,752
JOE: You both have matching dice?

3744
04:33:45,752 --> 04:33:51,320
TALIESIN: Yeah. I love these. They're cruel, but I
love these.

3745
04:33:51,320 --> 04:33:59,680
MATT: He's going to cast Finger of Death at you,
Scanlan. Scanlan, I need you to go ahead and make a

3746
04:33:59,680 --> 04:34:04,467
constitution saving throw.

3747
04:34:04,467 --> 04:34:06,774
JOE: That's good.

3748
04:34:06,774 --> 04:34:12,900
SAM: That's really good. 28.

3749
04:34:12,900 --> 04:34:15,070
MATT: That's a success. You take half damage.

3750
04:34:15,070 --> 04:34:18,576
SAM: Half damage.

3751
04:34:18,576 --> 04:34:25,264
MATT: So you take 49 points of necrotic damage,
half of it.

3752
04:34:25,264 --> 04:34:28,057
TRAVIS: Half of 49.

3753
04:34:28,057 --> 04:34:29,674
SAM: Alive!

3754
04:34:29,674 --> 04:34:31,234
MARISHA: You're still alive?

3755
04:34:31,234 --> 04:34:32,623
MATT: That'll be 24 points of damage.

3756
04:34:32,623 --> 04:34:34,027
LAURA: Are you resistant to necrotic?

3757
04:34:34,027 --> 04:34:34,918
SAM: No.

3758
04:34:34,918 --> 04:34:36,079
TALIESIN: But he made his save.

3759
04:34:36,079 --> 04:34:37,768
LAURA: I know. I just was hoping it would be half
again.

3760
04:34:37,768 --> 04:34:39,206
MATT: How much health are you at right now?

3761
04:34:39,206 --> 04:34:40,182
SAM: 14.

3762
04:34:40,182 --> 04:34:42,779
MATT: Holy shit! Goddamn it!

3763
04:34:42,779 --> 04:34:44,001
JOE: That was a huge roll!

3764
04:34:44,001 --> 04:34:57,885
MATT: I'm both frustrated and proud. All right.
Well, that ends Grog's turn with that. Vex, you're up.

3765
04:34:57,885 --> 04:35:04,243
LAURA: Bonus action, I'm going to take a superior
healing potion. So that's 8d4?

3766
04:35:04,243 --> 04:35:06,263
MATT: 8d4 plus eight, yeah.

3767
04:35:06,263 --> 04:35:18,086
TRAVIS: Mercer, at the end of my turn, the stun
fades? Or at the end of the round? I don't get a

3768
04:35:18,086 --> 04:35:19,208
reaction or anything?

3769
04:35:19,208 --> 04:35:25,564
MATT: I would say it goes through the full round,
it would be at the next round I'd say.

3770
04:35:25,564 --> 04:35:36,846
LAURA: Okay, so I'm back up to 67 hit points.
Fuck. Oh! No, stun, there's nothing you can do to

3771
04:35:36,846 --> 04:35:39,322
take the effect of stun away, is there?

3772
04:35:39,322 --> 04:35:42,122
MATT: Yes, Greater Restoration.

3773
04:35:42,122 --> 04:35:44,085
LAURA: Oh, that's it? Not Lesser?

3774
04:35:44,085 --> 04:35:46,537
MATT: I don't think Lesser gets rid of stun,
unfortunately.

3775
04:35:46,537 --> 04:36:03,748
LAURA: Fuck me. Okay. All righty. I'm going to fly
up to Scanlan, and I'm going to cast Cure Wounds

3776
04:36:03,748 --> 04:36:30,204
at 4th-level. That's 4d8 plus my wisdom. Oh,
that's good! 14, 21, 27. 27 plus three. 30 points healed!

3777
04:36:30,204 --> 04:36:40,428
SAM: May I do a cantrip on her? Minor Illusion,
just to turn her skin green.

3778
04:36:40,428 --> 04:36:44,410
(laughter)

3779
04:36:44,410 --> 04:36:46,179
MATT: I'll allow it.

3780
04:36:46,179 --> 04:36:53,821
TRAVIS: (singing) I'm flying high, defying
gravity!

3781
04:36:53,821 --> 04:36:55,487
SAM: Exalted. Exalted form.

3782
04:36:55,487 --> 04:37:00,259
LAURA: Thank you. (singing) Something has changed
within me.

3783
04:37:00,259 --> 04:37:02,941
SAM: The hat. The broom.

3784
04:37:02,941 --> 04:37:06,070
LAURA: All right, but it's so hot. But I'll do
it.

3785
04:37:06,070 --> 04:37:08,617
MATT: And that's the end of your turn.

3786
04:37:08,617 --> 04:37:11,855
LAURA: That's as far as I can move, right? I can't
move any more?

3787
04:37:11,855 --> 04:37:16,258
MATT: To get up there? You can move five more
feet.

3788
04:37:16,258 --> 04:37:24,305
LAURA: Can I get over the edge of the floating
building so I'm not flying over the crevasse?

3789
04:37:24,305 --> 04:37:26,228
MATT: We'll say right there. I'll put you right
there.

3790
04:37:26,228 --> 04:37:27,146
LAURA: Thank you.

3791
04:37:27,146 --> 04:37:29,360
MATT: You're right over the edge. Okay.

3792
04:37:29,360 --> 04:37:35,887
LAURA: (singing) Just Scanlan and-- (speaking) No,
sorry. That was terrible.

3793
04:37:35,887 --> 04:37:41,751
JOE: Okay, for the artists' sake, Grog and Arkhan
are right next to each other.

3794
04:37:41,751 --> 04:37:43,065
TRAVIS: Just so you know.

3795
04:37:43,065 --> 04:37:44,061
TALIESIN: Always.

3796
04:37:44,061 --> 04:37:45,318
LAURA: Whenever possible.

3797
04:37:45,318 --> 04:37:46,999
JOE: In case anyone was out there--

3798
04:37:46,999 --> 04:37:50,375
SAM: Hands shoved in each other's crotches.

3799
04:37:50,375 --> 04:37:53,119
LIAM: Getting each other ready.

3800
04:37:53,119 --> 04:37:56,365
JOE: Just lubing up. Glistening.

3801
04:37:56,365 --> 04:37:59,383
TRAVIS: Shit. Body-glide.

3802
04:37:59,383 --> 04:38:05,731
(laughter)

3803
04:38:05,731 --> 04:38:22,746
MATT: All right, Scanlan. I would like you to--
Here it is. I'd like you to make a wisdom saving

3804
04:38:22,746 --> 04:38:24,266
throw, please.

3805
04:38:24,266 --> 04:38:29,850
SAM: Not great. 15.

3806
04:38:29,850 --> 04:38:31,381
MATT: 15.

3807
04:38:31,381 --> 04:38:34,376
LAURA: Why so low?

3808
04:38:34,376 --> 04:38:36,909
SAM: I have negative two wisdom.

3809
04:38:36,909 --> 04:38:38,675
LAURA: You do?

3810
04:38:38,675 --> 04:38:39,770
SAM: I do.

3811
04:38:39,770 --> 04:38:43,628
MARISHA: Why have we not made fun of you for that
way more throughout the years?

3812
04:38:43,628 --> 04:38:47,357
SAM: Why do you think I make stupid decisions all
the time?

3813
04:38:47,357 --> 04:38:56,115
MATT: Scanlan. In the grasp of Bigby's Hand, you
suddenly become a tiny little fox!

3814
04:38:56,115 --> 04:38:57,531
LIAM: Where's Pike?

3815
04:38:57,531 --> 04:38:59,485
SAM: Do I maintain concentration?

3816
04:38:59,485 --> 04:39:01,114
MATT: You maintain concentration.

3817
04:39:01,114 --> 04:39:02,883
SAM: But I'm a fox.

3818
04:39:02,883 --> 04:39:04,221
MATT: Correct.

3819
04:39:04,221 --> 04:39:05,868
SAM: What do I say?

3820
04:39:05,868 --> 04:39:09,261
JOE: You're a sly fox.

3821
04:39:09,261 --> 04:39:11,368
SAM: I'm a fox.

3822
04:39:11,368 --> 04:39:14,990
JOE: Are foxes' wisdom better than Scanlan's?

3823
04:39:14,990 --> 04:39:16,963
MATT: He Polymorphs you into a fox.

3824
04:39:16,963 --> 04:39:19,288
TRAVIS: Pike, can you undo Polymorph?

3825
04:39:19,288 --> 04:39:28,868
SAM: Wow, that's terrible. Foxes can totally talk
and cast spells, though, right?

3826
04:39:28,868 --> 04:39:30,007
MATT: No.

3827
04:39:30,007 --> 04:39:31,985
TALIESIN: So is this a concentration spell?

3828
04:39:31,985 --> 04:39:38,362
SAM: Wow, that's shitty. That's a shitty low-level
spell use, Matt Mercer.

3829
04:39:38,362 --> 04:39:40,170
(laughter)

3830
04:39:40,170 --> 04:39:41,938
JOE: And that's a spell, correct?

3831
04:39:41,938 --> 04:39:46,347
MATT: That's the end of that. All right.

3832
04:39:46,347 --> 04:39:49,547
TALIESIN: And that's not a concentration spell.

3833
04:39:49,547 --> 04:39:55,933
SAM: Polymorph is. But I don't actually know if
that's what he used.

3834
04:39:55,933 --> 04:40:05,786
MATT: That was the end of Vex's turn, Vax, you're
up. Polymorph: an unwilling creature must make a

3835
04:40:05,786 --> 04:40:07,424
wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect.

3836
04:40:07,424 --> 04:40:11,996
SAM: Why do I have written down constitution?
Well, I'm wrong.

3837
04:40:11,996 --> 04:40:20,373
MATT: Okay. I'll double-check. Wisdom saving
throw. So anyway. What are you doing?

3838
04:40:20,373 --> 04:40:27,928
LIAM: Do I in my knowledge in having watched this
crazy motherfucker with Polymorph know if striking

3839
04:40:27,928 --> 04:40:34,217
him and taking away his little bit of life, he
poofs back, right? Okay, so bonus action to

3840
04:40:34,217 --> 04:40:42,557
disengage from Vecnards, and I'm going to fly at
that fox, and I am going to strike him with the

3841
04:40:42,557 --> 04:40:44,403
flame tongue dagger.

3842
04:40:44,403 --> 04:40:50,660
(cheering)

3843
04:40:50,660 --> 04:40:52,866
LIAM: Raven Queen sends her regards, fox!

3844
04:40:52,866 --> 04:40:55,493
MARISHA: Did John have a dead pool on when it was
going to fall?

3845
04:40:55,493 --> 04:40:58,639
TALIESIN: I would have gone with the tower.

3846
04:40:58,639 --> 04:41:00,523
MARISHA: That would have been my bet.

3847
04:41:00,523 --> 04:41:03,432
JOE: Was there a Jenga pool?

3848
04:41:03,432 --> 04:41:09,694
MATT: All right. So we'll say you were there, you
were there.

3849
04:41:09,694 --> 04:41:12,188
TRAVIS: The fox is by your left hand.

3850
04:41:12,188 --> 04:41:15,040
JOE: Left hand, right.

3851
04:41:15,040 --> 04:41:17,814
MATT: There we go. I see it. There we go. Fixed!

3852
04:41:17,814 --> 04:41:24,528
LIAM: Thankfully, it's not sneak attack, but I
rolled a natural 20 and rolled a one, so the dice

3853
04:41:24,528 --> 04:41:29,202
get doubled to two, plus my modifier of six on the
flame tongue is eight, so he gets hit for eight

3854
04:41:29,202 --> 04:41:31,918
hit points of damage. Do I see a gnome or a fox?

3855
04:41:31,918 --> 04:41:34,664
SAM: I assume fox will not survive very long.

3856
04:41:34,664 --> 04:41:37,548
JOE: I don't think a fox has eight hit points.

3857
04:41:37,548 --> 04:41:43,631
MARISHA: We know a kitten has one hit point. Wait,
five? Two hit points? A kitten's worth? A kitten's

3858
04:41:43,631 --> 04:41:45,117
worth of hit points.

3859
04:41:45,117 --> 04:41:53,212
LIAM: It's a fox. It's like a cat or a dog. It's
nothing.

3860
04:41:53,212 --> 04:41:58,000
SAM: You might have to dagger-dagger-dagger me.

3861
04:41:58,000 --> 04:42:06,368
MATT: We'll say six hit points. So a total of how
much damage was it?

3862
04:42:06,368 --> 04:42:07,788
LIAM: It was eight total.

3863
04:42:07,788 --> 04:42:09,182
MATT: So you take two damage.

3864
04:42:09,182 --> 04:42:16,056
LIAM: And we'll call that my hasted action, and
with my regular action, I will put my hands on the

3865
04:42:16,056 --> 04:42:27,406
side of Ioun's chosen and use Lay on Hands to give
him 20 hit points back, and then I will use the

3866
04:42:27,406 --> 04:42:33,727
rest of my movement to fly back into Vecna's
fucking face. And I have no attacks left, but I'll

3867
04:42:33,727 --> 04:42:34,919
stay there.

3868
04:42:34,919 --> 04:42:37,450
MATT: All righty.

3869
04:42:37,450 --> 04:42:38,508
LAURA: Jenga.

3870
04:42:38,508 --> 04:42:39,639
LIAM: Jenga!

3871
04:42:39,639 --> 04:42:42,785
MATT: All right, at the end of Vax's turn--

3872
04:42:42,785 --> 04:42:45,200
SAM: At the end of the night, it's going to be up
in the rafters!

3873
04:42:45,200 --> 04:42:48,855
MATT: He is going to cast a fifth-level
Banishment.

3874
04:42:48,855 --> 04:42:53,873
LAURA: On who?

3875
04:42:53,873 --> 04:43:00,687
TRAVIS: There's a fucking treehouse on top of the
Fraggle Rock construction.

3876
04:43:00,687 --> 04:43:04,744
MATT: So I need a charisma saving throw on Grog
and Scanlan.

3877
04:43:04,744 --> 04:43:14,895
SAM: 21.

3878
04:43:14,895 --> 04:43:16,977
TRAVIS: 12.

3879
04:43:16,977 --> 04:43:25,023
MATT: Both Scanlan and Grog (poof) from existence.
Bigby's Hand remains, because concentration is

3880
04:43:25,023 --> 04:43:27,138
maintained-- oh god!

3881
04:43:27,138 --> 04:43:29,537
SAM: Everything's breaking.

3882
04:43:29,537 --> 04:43:33,172
Pike broke. Pike straight-up broke.

3883
04:43:33,172 --> 04:43:36,545
ASHLEY: That's okay. It's okay.

3884
04:43:36,545 --> 04:43:39,114
SAM: Right, the first roll was a nine, right?

3885
04:43:39,114 --> 04:43:42,589
JOE: Oh no. What's that?

3886
04:43:42,589 --> 04:43:47,943
SAM: The first roll I did was a nine? It was nine,
yeah.

3887
04:43:47,943 --> 04:43:49,417
JOE: It was either a six or a nine. I don't know.

3888
04:43:49,417 --> 04:43:50,649
MATT: Look at that.

3889
04:43:50,649 --> 04:43:51,795
JOE: You have glue?!

3890
04:43:51,795 --> 04:43:53,129
MATT: Hopefully it hasn't dried up.

3891
04:43:53,129 --> 04:43:56,487
SAM: Here, we'll work on it while you DM. We've
got it. Give it over here.

3892
04:43:56,487 --> 04:43:58,117
MATT: There you go. (laughs)

3893
04:43:58,117 --> 04:44:04,306
TRAVIS: I do have advantage on them because of
mage slayer, just in case.

3894
04:44:04,306 --> 04:44:06,699
LAURA: And you would have gotten to attack him!

3895
04:44:06,699 --> 04:44:11,581
TRAVIS: Oh, that's actually a 20! I rolled a 19 on
the advantage roll.

3896
04:44:11,581 --> 04:44:17,650
MATT: It's not enough, unfortunately, and mage
slayer is a reaction. They both vanish from the

3897
04:44:17,650 --> 04:44:20,258
space. All right.

3898
04:44:20,258 --> 04:44:22,453
TALIESIN: Did he take his half damage from me, by
the way, from the crits?

3899
04:44:22,453 --> 04:44:33,694
MATT: Yes, he did. 22 was the total from that one.
All right. That brings us back to the 20. At which

3900
04:44:33,694 --> 04:44:37,943
point, the dark energy emanates once more,
removing any sort of necrotic resistance from

3901
04:44:37,943 --> 04:44:39,404
anybody within the vicinity.

3902
04:44:39,404 --> 04:44:40,925
LIAM: Removing resistance?

3903
04:44:40,925 --> 04:44:43,493
LAURA: Yeah, we don't get necrotic for the next
turn.

3904
04:44:43,493 --> 04:44:44,869
MATT: Arkhan.

3905
04:44:44,869 --> 04:44:46,302
SAM: Did Pike give the trammel already?

3906
04:44:46,302 --> 04:44:49,927
TRAVIS: No, she had it out in her hand. She
couldn't give it to me.

3907
04:44:49,927 --> 04:44:51,049
SAM: She still has it?

3908
04:44:51,049 --> 04:44:54,020
MARISHA: But you're gone, so that sucks.

3909
04:44:54,020 --> 04:44:58,787
LAURA: But if we can break his concentration, they
come back, right?

3910
04:44:58,787 --> 04:45:04,689
JOE: Okay, that's going to be 31.

3911
04:45:04,689 --> 04:45:06,240
MATT: 31 hits.

3912
04:45:06,240 --> 04:45:13,643
JOE: That's a straight-up 2d8. And yes, I said
"two die eight," people at home. I'm old school,

3913
04:45:13,643 --> 04:45:23,408
okay? I learned how to play in the 80s, and we say
"two die eight." Not bad. That's going to be 30

3914
04:45:23,408 --> 04:45:24,501
points of damage.

3915
04:45:24,501 --> 04:45:26,444
MATT: 30 points of damage. All righty.

3916
04:45:26,444 --> 04:45:28,339
SAM: Halved? What kind of damage?

3917
04:45:28,339 --> 04:45:30,247
JOE: It's 30. Straight-up slashing.

3918
04:45:30,247 --> 04:45:32,387
TRAVIS: He has disadvantage on his saving throws.

3919
04:45:32,387 --> 04:45:37,376
MATT: That's going to be a 21, so he succeeds on
the first hit.

3920
04:45:37,376 --> 04:45:41,642
JOE: Okay. 27.

3921
04:45:41,642 --> 04:45:43,470
MATT: 27 hits.

3922
04:45:43,470 --> 04:45:45,640
SAM: Come on, roll big.

3923
04:45:45,640 --> 04:45:49,423
JOE: That's another 30 points of damage.

3924
04:45:49,423 --> 04:45:58,129
MATT: 30 points of damage again. Making his save.
That's ten plus seven. That's 17, so yes, because

3925
04:45:58,129 --> 04:46:00,344
the DC is 15 for the damage he takes, so he
succeeds.

3926
04:46:00,344 --> 04:46:02,266
TRAVIS: And that's with disadvantage, too!

3927
04:46:02,266 --> 04:46:06,715
SAM: You got this, friend. No, you don't got
this.

3928
04:46:06,715 --> 04:46:08,801
JOE: 23 for my third attack.

3929
04:46:08,801 --> 04:46:10,520
TALIESIN: That hits.

3930
04:46:10,520 --> 04:46:12,754
LAURA: Big damage.

3931
04:46:12,754 --> 04:46:18,566
JOE: I can't do much more than what I did before,
but that's 25. Get a one. Roll a one!

3932
04:46:18,566 --> 04:46:24,644
MATT: That's a two. Two and a three!

3933
04:46:24,644 --> 04:46:25,761
SAM: Two and a three?

3934
04:46:25,761 --> 04:46:26,665
MATT: Yeah.

3935
04:46:26,665 --> 04:46:33,974
(cheering)

3936
04:46:33,974 --> 04:46:36,187
MATT: Damn it. Okay, then.

3937
04:46:36,187 --> 04:46:38,404
LIAM: Back in the game!

3938
04:46:38,404 --> 04:46:44,616
MATT: Okay. Arkhan, end of your turn?

3939
04:46:44,616 --> 04:46:47,363
JOE: That's it. That's all I've got.

3940
04:46:47,363 --> 04:46:49,111
MATT: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

3941
04:46:49,111 --> 04:46:57,909
MARISHA: Okay, you have the trammel. No, Pike has
the trammel. Scanlan, how many hit points do you have?

3942
04:46:57,909 --> 04:46:59,594
SAM: 62.

3943
04:46:59,594 --> 04:47:05,633
MARISHA: Do I do more damage to this guy, or do I
heal Scanlan? Pike, what about you?

3944
04:47:05,633 --> 04:47:08,539
ASHLEY: I'm at 106.

3945
04:47:08,539 --> 04:47:09,868
MARISHA: You all right?

3946
04:47:09,868 --> 04:47:11,864
PIKE: Yeah. Heal Scanlan.

3947
04:47:11,864 --> 04:47:17,017
MARISHA: Scanlan's got the book.

3948
04:47:17,017 --> 04:47:20,165
LIAM: He's the most important. I'm not important.

3949
04:47:20,165 --> 04:47:24,822
MARISHA: Fuck. Yeah, I'm going to fly down and do
a healing touch on Scanlan.

3950
04:47:24,822 --> 04:47:28,302
SAM: Keyleth, I can take care of myself.

3951
04:47:28,302 --> 04:47:30,018
TALIESIN: Shut the fuck up.

3952
04:47:30,018 --> 04:47:31,778
TRAVIS: Shut your beautiful mouth!

3953
04:47:31,778 --> 04:47:33,700
MARISHA: You've got the fucking book!

3954
04:47:33,700 --> 04:47:41,404
TRAVIS: God. I'm rubbing my thigh, but there's
nothing wrong with it!

3955
04:47:41,404 --> 04:47:45,159
(laughter)

3956
04:47:45,159 --> 04:47:50,868
SAM: I can't get any superglue to come out of this
shit. I've been biting on it. I've been doing all

3957
04:47:50,868 --> 04:47:52,755
kinds of shit to it. We need a knife.

3958
04:47:52,755 --> 04:47:55,147
MATT: Well, no wonder it's not coming out.

3959
04:47:55,147 --> 04:47:59,539
JOE: I've got more work for you to do. Put the
shield back on.

3960
04:47:59,539 --> 04:48:02,658
SAM: I need a knife or scissors.

3961
04:48:02,658 --> 04:48:06,591
MATT: (laughs) You chewed the end closed!

3962
04:48:06,591 --> 04:48:08,761
TRAVIS: Did Arkhan break?

3963
04:48:08,761 --> 04:48:11,172
MATT: Yeah, the shield came off.

3964
04:48:11,172 --> 04:48:14,054
SAM: It's okay. It's the last episode.

3965
04:48:14,054 --> 04:48:20,692
MARISHA: 39 plus three, so 42. You get 42 hit
points.

3966
04:48:20,692 --> 04:48:22,231
SAM: Me?

3967
04:48:22,231 --> 04:48:23,182
MARISHA: Yeah.

3968
04:48:23,182 --> 04:48:24,551
SAM: Oh shit, that's actually great!

3969
04:48:24,551 --> 04:48:28,844
MARISHA: And you are freed from any curse,
disease, poison, blindness, or deafness. And I'm

3970
04:48:28,844 --> 04:48:35,510
going to use the rest of my movement to go up and
get in Vecna's face, as well, and be like, what's

3971
04:48:35,510 --> 04:48:42,971
up? Oh hey, we're pulling an Alfred Hitchcock
right now! Birds. Birds!

3972
04:48:42,971 --> 04:48:45,731
TRAVIS: "You can't see me" doesn't work because
you're in his face.

3973
04:48:45,731 --> 04:48:46,973
MARISHA: I'm John Cena.

3974
04:48:46,973 --> 04:48:53,947
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Percy.

3975
04:48:53,947 --> 04:48:59,212
TALIESIN: There's been a lot of damage done this
round, hasn't there? There's been a reasonable

3976
04:48:59,212 --> 04:49:00,383
amount.

3977
04:49:00,383 --> 04:49:05,552
JOE: Watch that, because it's going that way. Or
you can put him on the base or something. Or we

3978
04:49:05,552 --> 04:49:07,481
could pretend he's on top of that thing.

3979
04:49:07,481 --> 04:49:08,687
MARISHA: This is my favorite mini game!

3980
04:49:08,687 --> 04:49:15,360
TALIESIN: I've got a weird question: if I burn a
grit point for an arm shot, can I make him drop

3981
04:49:15,360 --> 04:49:16,535
his hand?

3982
04:49:16,535 --> 04:49:17,609
MATT: What's that?

3983
04:49:17,609 --> 04:49:20,327
TALIESIN: If I burn a grit point for an arm shot,
can I make him drop his hand?

3984
04:49:20,327 --> 04:49:22,126
MATT: No, it's attached to his body.

3985
04:49:22,126 --> 04:49:24,436
TALIESIN: I know it's stitched on--

3986
04:49:24,436 --> 04:49:26,724
MATT: It's attached to his body.

3987
04:49:26,724 --> 04:49:28,643
TALIESIN: If I hit it a bunch--

3988
04:49:28,643 --> 04:49:31,341
MATT: You can't shoot his hand off.

3989
04:49:31,341 --> 04:49:39,589
TALIESIN: That's fine. I was spit-balling. I'm
going to curl around the corner and I'm going to

3990
04:49:39,589 --> 04:49:46,824
hold my turn for-- who's the last of us to go? I'm
going to hold my turn for any spells that he

3991
04:49:46,824 --> 04:49:52,230
casts, and I'm going to blast him three times the
second he casts a spell on anybody. Right after a

3992
04:49:52,230 --> 04:49:53,599
spell, I'm going to hit him.

3993
04:49:53,599 --> 04:49:55,301
MATT: Scanlan, your turn.

3994
04:49:55,301 --> 04:49:58,577
SAM: My turn? I've already inspired Grog.

3995
04:49:58,577 --> 04:49:59,914
LIAM: Hold for Pike.

3996
04:49:59,914 --> 04:50:03,158
SAM: I'll hold for Pike.

3997
04:50:03,158 --> 04:50:05,049
MATT: All right, what are you holding?

3998
04:50:05,049 --> 04:50:10,019
SAM: I'm going to hold the book! And I will
inspire Pike.

3999
04:50:10,019 --> 04:50:14,788
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

4000
04:50:14,788 --> 04:50:19,648
TALIESIN: Man, he's looking way too smug.

4001
04:50:19,648 --> 04:50:25,811
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got one legendary resistance
left. He's been saving it.

4002
04:50:25,811 --> 04:50:28,476
SAM: I'll inspire Pike, yeah.

4003
04:50:28,476 --> 04:50:32,940
MATT: All right. So Pike, take your inspiration
die. What do you say to Pike?

4004
04:50:32,940 --> 04:50:38,707
SAM: I will sing to her: (singing) She's a good
girl.

4005
04:50:38,707 --> 04:50:41,043
(groaning)

4006
04:50:41,043 --> 04:50:42,767
SAM: That's it.

4007
04:50:42,767 --> 04:50:44,276
(laughter)

4008
04:50:44,276 --> 04:50:46,568
SAM: (singing) Loves her Scanlan.

4009
04:50:46,568 --> 04:50:50,349
MATT: All righty. Pike, it's your turn.

4010
04:50:50,349 --> 04:50:52,282
JOE: (singing) Loves chicken.

4011
04:50:52,282 --> 04:51:03,092
ASHLEY: No. Let's not do it. Okay. Passing over
the trammel to Grog, is that a bonus action, or

4012
04:51:03,092 --> 04:51:06,861
that's my action? Because I'm right next to him?

4013
04:51:06,861 --> 04:51:23,778
MATT: I'd say handing it over point-to-point, I'll
allow it to be part of an action because he's

4014
04:51:23,778 --> 04:51:25,737
right next to you and he's capable now.

4015
04:51:25,737 --> 04:51:32,860
ASHLEY: Okay. Because I was going to also try
something else, but I don't know if I can. I was

4016
04:51:32,860 --> 04:51:40,287
also going to try to clasp my holy symbol and try
to see if I can do Divine Intervention.

4017
04:51:40,287 --> 04:51:47,354
MATT: Okay. Roll 2d10. Roll the first one; tell me
what you get.

4018
04:51:47,354 --> 04:51:53,476
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. Why not, right?

4019
04:51:53,476 --> 04:52:01,095
MARISHA: Can you bring that third trammel back?
You get to ask your god for something awesome.

4020
04:52:01,095 --> 04:52:03,759
LIAM: This is the giant dragon punch. We saw in
the past.

4021
04:52:03,759 --> 04:52:05,027
ASHLEY: Six?

4022
04:52:05,027 --> 04:52:13,159
MATT: Okay, that's not a success, unfortunately. I
know, sorry! Sarenrae's influence cannot break

4023
04:52:13,159 --> 04:52:17,500
past this barrier right now, with your proximity
to Vecna. The sheer force of his current presence

4024
04:52:17,500 --> 04:52:19,378
is too strong.

4025
04:52:19,378 --> 04:52:24,941
ASHLEY: All right, I'll pass the trammel to Grog.

4026
04:52:24,941 --> 04:52:29,721
SAM: You aren't going to use your inspiration? All
right, whatever.

4027
04:52:29,721 --> 04:52:40,595
ASHLEY: Can't use it for that. Can I subtract
whatever I roll for the inspiration?

4028
04:52:40,595 --> 04:52:45,956
MATT: (laughs) Unfortunately, no. He's going to
attempt to Fire Bolt--

4029
04:52:45,956 --> 04:52:47,497
JOE: You mean reverse math?

4030
04:52:47,497 --> 04:52:50,482
ASHLEY: Yeah, reverse math. (laughs)

4031
04:52:50,482 --> 04:53:03,016
MATT: Going to Fire Bolt you, Vax. That's going to
be a 21 to hit.

4032
04:53:03,016 --> 04:53:04,562
LIAM: No, fuck you.

4033
04:53:04,562 --> 04:53:09,999
TRAVIS: I'll use my reaction now that the end of
the round is over with to make an attack on him.

4034
04:53:09,999 --> 04:53:11,966
MATT: Well, it's not until the very end of the
round.

4035
04:53:11,966 --> 04:53:13,445
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought it was the very end.

4036
04:53:13,445 --> 04:53:17,415
MATT: <i>Now</i> it's the end of the round. You have
control of yourself back. We're back at the top of

4037
04:53:17,415 --> 04:53:18,901
the round, which is Vecna.

4038
04:53:18,901 --> 04:53:20,462
TRAVIS: I've stopped peeing myself.

4039
04:53:20,462 --> 04:53:29,723
JOE: Matt, we've got a good thing going on with
this glue now. Could you pass me Arkhan back?

4040
04:53:29,723 --> 04:53:34,596
LIAM: I love that we are working on miniatures at
the table.

4041
04:53:34,596 --> 04:53:37,089
JOE: It's helping us with our nerves.

4042
04:53:37,089 --> 04:53:41,713
LIAM: Oh, it's very calming, working on minis.

4043
04:53:41,713 --> 04:53:45,549
JOE: You got some watercolors back there, Matt?

4044
04:53:45,549 --> 04:53:47,560
(laughter)

4045
04:53:47,560 --> 04:53:50,046
MATT: Strangely, no.

4046
04:53:50,046 --> 04:53:51,939
LIAM: On his utility belt.

4047
04:53:51,939 --> 04:53:56,379
JOE: We got tape. We got glue. We got everything.

4048
04:53:56,379 --> 04:54:05,275
MATT: Oh, this will be interesting.

4049
04:54:05,275 --> 04:54:11,416
ASHLEY: I have a question. Has Vecna still been
healing with each round?

4050
04:54:11,416 --> 04:54:13,601
TRAVIS: We've been dealing some pretty good
damage.

4051
04:54:13,601 --> 04:54:15,305
LIAM: Yeah, we've been hurting him pretty
bad.

4052
04:54:15,305 --> 04:54:17,336
TRAVIS: Especially with Ark--

4053
04:54:17,336 --> 04:54:18,863
LIAM: The Ark reactor.

4054
04:54:18,863 --> 04:54:20,102
ASHLEY: That was crazy.

4055
04:54:20,102 --> 04:54:27,625
SAM: Wow, this is the fucking craziest game ever.
It's midnight.

4056
04:54:27,625 --> 04:54:29,992
TALIESIN: Is it? I can't feel anything.

4057
04:54:29,992 --> 04:54:32,085
MARISHA: The fact that none of us are dead.

4058
04:54:32,085 --> 04:54:35,849
MATT: Trust me, I know.

4059
04:54:35,849 --> 04:54:42,657
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

4060
04:54:42,657 --> 04:54:46,295
MATT: Vecna is going to, through the Hand Of
Vecna, begin to attempt to Teleport.

4061
04:54:46,295 --> 04:54:48,067
LAURA: No!

4062
04:54:48,067 --> 04:54:49,967
TALIESIN: I take my shots.

4063
04:54:49,967 --> 04:54:51,621
MARISHA: Fuck that hand.

4064
04:54:51,621 --> 04:54:53,538
JOE: Fucking chop that hand.

4065
04:54:53,538 --> 04:54:55,556
TRAVIS: I do have a reaction.

4066
04:54:55,556 --> 04:54:58,218
LIAM: Does reaction work like attack of
opportunity?

4067
04:54:58,218 --> 04:55:01,318
TRAVIS: No, I do. I have a melee reaction.

4068
04:55:01,318 --> 04:55:10,324
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my shots. Shot number
one. Yeah, as long as I've got reaction I knew what I was

4069
04:55:10,596 --> 04:55:11,545
doing.

4070
04:55:11,545 --> 04:55:14,028
MATT: Because you held action, so yes.

4071
04:55:14,028 --> 04:55:15,472
MARISHA: And how far can he go?

4072
04:55:15,472 --> 04:55:17,171
JOE: He can go anywhere.

4073
04:55:17,171 --> 04:55:28,205
TALIESIN: That would have been 25. These are all
sharpshooter, fuck it.

4074
04:55:28,205 --> 04:55:33,897
SAM: Do I have a reaction?

4075
04:55:33,897 --> 04:55:35,834
MATT: You would.

4076
04:55:35,834 --> 04:55:37,472
SAM: Is it worth it?

4077
04:55:37,472 --> 04:55:39,609
LIAM: To keep him here? Yeah. He's running away.

4078
04:55:39,609 --> 04:55:41,258
MARISHA: He's trying to run away, trying to
teleport away.

4079
04:55:41,258 --> 04:55:44,450
SAM: Okay.

4080
04:55:44,450 --> 04:55:46,839
MATT: Are you going to try to Counterspell?

4081
04:55:46,839 --> 04:55:48,392
SAM: I'll Counterspell.

4082
04:55:48,392 --> 04:55:53,444
MATT: Okay. What level?

4083
04:55:53,444 --> 04:55:55,194
SAM: Nine.

4084
04:55:55,194 --> 04:55:57,502
LIAM: Oh.

4085
04:55:57,502 --> 04:55:59,215
MARISHA: (whoops)

4086
04:55:59,215 --> 04:56:00,699
JOE: That was pretty clutch.

4087
04:56:00,699 --> 04:56:02,312
MARISHA: That's right, you used your Wish last
night.

4088
04:56:02,312 --> 04:56:09,151
MATT: Well, that definitely works. (laughs) Okay,
then.

4089
04:56:09,151 --> 04:56:11,004
TRAVIS: I'm still going to hit you.

4090
04:56:11,004 --> 04:56:13,093
MATT: Go for it.

4091
04:56:13,093 --> 04:56:17,506
SAM: That was going to save Vax.

4092
04:56:17,506 --> 04:56:24,949
TRAVIS: Can I take the Sword of Kas and aim for
the Hand of Vecna? Can I try and chop the wrist?

4093
04:56:24,949 --> 04:56:30,299
MATT: Sure. Try for it.

4094
04:56:30,299 --> 04:56:32,882
TRAVIS: Why not? Reckless.

4095
04:56:32,882 --> 04:56:34,970
MATT: You have disadvantage on the attack,
though.

4096
04:56:34,970 --> 04:56:42,715
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, I have advantage normally,
reckless, so just a straight roll. 32?

4097
04:56:42,715 --> 04:56:44,403
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

4098
04:56:44,403 --> 04:56:46,962
LIAM: Yeah. That's our Grog.

4099
04:56:46,962 --> 04:56:48,587
LAURA: That's our Grog!

4100
04:56:48,587 --> 04:56:50,506
SAM: I'm sorry, Liam.

4101
04:56:50,506 --> 04:56:54,657
LAURA: Anybody got a camera so we can put this in
the scrapbook later?

4102
04:56:54,657 --> 04:56:59,745
TALIESIN: No. It's okay.

4103
04:56:59,745 --> 04:57:04,783
SAM: Sorry, bud.

4104
04:57:04,783 --> 04:57:10,501
TRAVIS: 33. Hand stay on him?

4105
04:57:10,501 --> 04:57:12,880
MATT: Hand stays on him, yeah.

4106
04:57:12,880 --> 04:57:15,593
TRAVIS: Okay. Cool. That's just my reaction.

4107
04:57:15,593 --> 04:57:17,314
JOE: You trying to chop off his hand?

4108
04:57:17,314 --> 04:57:20,448
TRAVIS: Yeah, thought I'd maybe Luke Skywalker his
hand.

4109
04:57:20,448 --> 04:57:23,925
MATT: That ends Vecna's turn. He seems extremely
frustrated.

4110
04:57:23,925 --> 04:57:32,138
TALIESIN: And he just took from me, because I took
my shots. It was 26 damage plus one psychic for

4111
04:57:32,138 --> 04:57:48,199
the first one. Goddamn it. The other one hits, and
again, goddamn it. 24 damage plus one psychic. And

4112
04:57:48,199 --> 04:57:54,501
the third shot probably does not hit. Third shot
does not hit.

4113
04:57:54,501 --> 04:57:59,658
MATT: Okay. (gunshots) Everyone's swarming up
around him, and each time he tries to cast a

4114
04:57:59,658 --> 04:58:04,359
spell, even in his current divine form, he's
growing more and more frustrated. You can see now

4115
04:58:04,359 --> 04:58:10,341
as this hulking entity is still bursting into
Vasselheim and destroying, you can see a moment of

4116
04:58:10,341 --> 04:58:16,387
panic in a fresh god's eyes. Ends Vecna's turn.
Grog, you're up.

4117
04:58:16,387 --> 04:58:25,593
TRAVIS: With all the rage I've ever had, I will
reckless attack. Grab the trammel from Pike and

4118
04:58:25,593 --> 04:58:28,306
aim it right in his stupid chest.

4119
04:58:28,306 --> 04:58:30,541
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check, Grog.

4120
04:58:30,541 --> 04:58:46,784
TRAVIS: Yeah, enough. Inspiration because fuck it,
why not? Yep. That's 33.

4121
04:58:46,784 --> 04:58:50,883
LAURA: You don't get that because it's strength.

4122
04:58:50,883 --> 04:58:53,095
TRAVIS: Oh, right. 33.

4123
04:58:53,095 --> 04:59:01,188
LAURA: He's marking off a resistance. You just did
that, didn't you?

4124
04:59:01,188 --> 04:59:07,423
MATT: That's actually not what I did, but you can
think what you want. All right, so what's the

4125
04:59:07,423 --> 04:59:08,650
grand total on that?

4126
04:59:08,650 --> 04:59:09,956
TRAVIS: 33 was the total.

4127
04:59:09,956 --> 04:59:18,216
MATT: 33. As you take the trammel, grabbing the
bottom of the ribcage, curving it underneath, you

4128
04:59:18,216 --> 04:59:25,202
thrust it up into the core center, it seems, of
his chest, where the avatar arcane energy is

4129
04:59:25,202 --> 04:59:32,194
amassed. And as the trammel squeezes in, you hear
the guttural rage from the inside of Vecna,

4130
04:59:32,194 --> 04:59:42,690
screaming, "You dare!" And as he inhales, the
force of the voice is pulled back into a moment of

4131
04:59:42,690 --> 04:59:46,941
weakness, and once again, you can see the fear
flickering in the eyes. The burning rage of the

4132
04:59:46,941 --> 04:59:52,273
green flame begins to diminish ever so slightly as
the second trammel is applied.

4133
04:59:52,273 --> 04:59:58,132
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm going to keep hitting him. I
have my hasted attack.

4134
04:59:58,132 --> 05:00:00,939
MATT: You don't have a hasted attack. It faded.

4135
05:00:00,939 --> 05:00:09,478
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. My bonus
action is a straight-up reckless. 17. That's a

4136
05:00:09,478 --> 05:00:29,036
million. 35 is to hit. Eight, 24, 32, 42. Enlarge.
44.

4137
05:00:29,036 --> 05:00:40,837
MATT: As you're cutting through the body, you see
bits of Vecna's avatar form tattering and falling

4138
05:00:40,837 --> 05:00:48,288
apart. I would like you to make an intelligence
check.

4139
05:00:48,288 --> 05:00:55,773
SAM: 22.

4140
05:00:55,773 --> 05:01:05,633
MATT: You were told and knew that you could not
kill a god. A god that ascended from a lich form

4141
05:01:05,633 --> 05:01:15,773
generally has the capability, if the body is
destroyed, to reform elsewhere. You begin to get

4142
05:01:15,773 --> 05:01:24,462
the sense that at a certain point, if you end up
destroying this avatar form, it might ruin

4143
05:01:24,462 --> 05:01:25,922
everything.

4144
05:01:25,922 --> 05:01:29,100
SAM: As in, don't use the book?

4145
05:01:29,100 --> 05:01:31,266
LAURA: As in, don't keep attacking him.

4146
05:01:31,266 --> 05:01:34,258
SAM: As in don't kill him.

4147
05:01:34,258 --> 05:01:37,413
LAURA: If we keep attacking him, he's going to
take too much damage.

4148
05:01:37,413 --> 05:01:39,293
MARISHA: The trammels are in.

4149
05:01:39,293 --> 05:01:43,131
SAM: The two trammels are in? He has one more
legendary save.

4150
05:01:43,131 --> 05:01:44,459
JOE: Read the book.

4151
05:01:44,459 --> 05:01:48,494
TRAVIS: Literally, it's all we got.

4152
05:01:48,494 --> 05:01:50,142
LIAM: It's Reading Rainbow time.

4153
05:01:50,142 --> 05:01:51,452
JOE: Time to cross the streams.

4154
05:01:51,452 --> 05:01:55,983
TALIESIN: If we're not careful, this gets worse.

4155
05:01:55,983 --> 05:01:57,484
SAM: Is someone before me?

4156
05:01:57,484 --> 05:01:59,917
MATT: Grog, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.

4157
05:01:59,917 --> 05:02:01,272
MARISHA: We're all before you.

4158
05:02:01,272 --> 05:02:04,385
LAURA: What's your hit points at now, Scanlan?

4159
05:02:04,385 --> 05:02:05,900
SAM: I'm fine.

4160
05:02:05,900 --> 05:02:08,279
MARISHA: Just tell us what your hit points are.

4161
05:02:08,279 --> 05:02:12,062
SAM: 106. I'm fine.

4162
05:02:12,062 --> 05:02:34,830
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on Scanlan at
3rd-level. 19 plus three is 22 hit points, and I'm

4163
05:02:34,830 --> 05:02:38,571
going to fly down next to Percy.

4164
05:02:38,571 --> 05:02:53,062
MATT: You get roughly to the edge here with your
50 movement. I'll say you can land. Sure. I'll

4165
05:02:53,062 --> 05:02:57,371
allow it. Okay. That ends your turn. Vax,
you're up.

4166
05:02:57,371 --> 05:03:02,752
LIAM: I'm going to use a bonus action to look over
my shoulder and see everyone that I know. I'm

4167
05:03:02,752 --> 05:03:06,885
going to see my sister and her husband. I'm going
to see the woman that I love. I'm going to see

4168
05:03:06,885 --> 05:03:16,103
Grog. I'm going to see Arkhan. I'm going to see my
friend Scanlan. And then I'm going to dig into

4169
05:03:16,103 --> 05:03:18,676
Vecna's eye and stab away.

4170
05:03:18,676 --> 05:03:22,012
LAURA: Don't do too much damage!

4171
05:03:22,012 --> 05:03:25,632
LIAM: It's too late.

4172
05:03:25,632 --> 05:03:31,293
TRAVIS: What? It's not too late. Retcon that shit.
You haven't rolled a thing.

4173
05:03:31,293 --> 05:03:33,496
LIAM: No?

4174
05:03:33,496 --> 05:03:36,543
TRAVIS: No. He just told us.

4175
05:03:36,543 --> 05:03:41,277
LIAM: I will use it to grapple.

4176
05:03:41,277 --> 05:03:46,652
MATT: Okay. So make an acrobatics or athletics
check.

4177
05:03:46,652 --> 05:03:48,259
LIAM: Should I reroll?

4178
05:03:48,259 --> 05:03:52,221
MATT: Actually, for grapple, it may just be
athletics. Let me double-check here.

4179
05:03:52,221 --> 05:04:05,142
LIAM: Two rolls here, unused.

4180
05:04:05,142 --> 05:04:09,354
MATT: It's an athletics check, so roll athletics.

4181
05:04:09,354 --> 05:04:20,597
LIAM: That is a 22.

4182
05:04:20,597 --> 05:04:23,812
MATT: 19 plus five, 24. Grapple fails.

4183
05:04:23,812 --> 05:04:26,021
LIAM: All right. That was my--

4184
05:04:26,021 --> 05:04:29,094
(clattering over Skype)

4185
05:04:29,094 --> 05:04:31,110
(laughter)

4186
05:04:31,110 --> 05:04:35,762
ASHLEY: I was getting a tissue, and I dropped a
fork.

4187
05:04:35,762 --> 05:04:49,041
LIAM: That was my hasted action. I'm going to stay
here and fucking hug Vecna's face.

4188
05:04:49,041 --> 05:05:02,622
MATT: All right. That brings us to the 20. The
buildings shift back once more across the ground.

4189
05:05:02,622 --> 05:05:13,860
These begin to rotate and spread outward this way.
That one merely stays where it is. At this point

4190
05:05:13,860 --> 05:05:15,559
in time, Arkhan?

4191
05:05:15,559 --> 05:05:17,814
JOE: So we don't want to do any more damage?

4192
05:05:17,814 --> 05:05:18,932
TALIESIN: No.

4193
05:05:18,932 --> 05:05:25,031
JOE: All right. I'm going to attempt to grapple
his arm with that hand on it.

4194
05:05:25,031 --> 05:05:26,441
MATT: Okay.

4195
05:05:26,441 --> 05:05:39,775
JOE: That's good. That's a natural 19. What would
I add? Proficiency plus strength?

4196
05:05:39,775 --> 05:05:45,287
MATT: This would be, on a grapple? That's
athletics check.

4197
05:05:45,287 --> 05:05:47,513
JOE: Oh. Athletics check.

4198
05:05:47,513 --> 05:05:49,678
TRAVIS: I don't think the hand comes off unless
the person goes.

4199
05:05:49,678 --> 05:05:51,550
JOE: 30.

4200
05:05:51,550 --> 05:05:55,010
MATT: Okay, and that was a 19, so you are
currently grappling the hand.

4201
05:05:55,010 --> 05:05:57,028
JOE: Okay. And that's my whole action?

4202
05:05:57,028 --> 05:05:58,838
MATT: That's an attack to grapple.

4203
05:05:58,838 --> 05:06:12,068
JOE: Attack. Oh, attack. What do I do with my
other attacks? Hold? There's no way to twist the

4204
05:06:12,068 --> 05:06:15,445
hand off? He tried. He tried it before.

4205
05:06:15,445 --> 05:06:20,710
MATT: It's on there pretty tight. It's not just a
hand you can cut off. It's an artifact. It's

4206
05:06:20,710 --> 05:06:22,199
returned to its original owner.

4207
05:06:22,199 --> 05:06:30,253
MARISHA: I would be dropping my planetar shape
which is making me fly right now.

4208
05:06:30,253 --> 05:06:32,954
JOE: Can I hold my bonus?

4209
05:06:32,954 --> 05:06:34,976
MATT: No, it's an action.

4210
05:06:34,976 --> 05:06:36,557
JOE: I'm out.

4211
05:06:36,557 --> 05:06:38,224
MATT: Spent your turn, yeah.

4212
05:06:38,224 --> 05:06:43,672
JOE: Is there a way to pull him down?

4213
05:06:43,672 --> 05:06:47,605
MATT: Not at this size and the fact that you're
flying there; he's too big.

4214
05:06:47,605 --> 05:06:54,087
JOE: All right. Then I'm going to hang. Just going
to grapple.

4215
05:06:54,087 --> 05:06:58,650
MATT: That brings us to Keyleth.

4216
05:06:58,650 --> 05:07:05,508
SAM: What you got, girl?

4217
05:07:05,508 --> 05:07:08,621
LAURA: Can you grapple him?

4218
05:07:08,621 --> 05:07:10,518
SAM: Grapple and pull him down.

4219
05:07:10,518 --> 05:07:16,294
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. I'll take the other side that
Arkhan has not. Grab the other side of him and try

4220
05:07:16,294 --> 05:07:20,348
and grapple him, leaving him open and available
for Scanlan.

4221
05:07:20,348 --> 05:07:22,005
MATT: Make an athletics check.

4222
05:07:22,005 --> 05:07:30,167
SAM: You have no spells that don't do damage?
Nothing that holds, nothing that silences? Nothing

4223
05:07:30,167 --> 05:07:34,618
that feebles? Not as Keyleth?

4224
05:07:34,618 --> 05:07:42,593
MARISHA: I'm a planetar. If I drop this, then I
fall. What am I doing? Athletics check?

4225
05:07:42,593 --> 05:07:44,956
MATT: The current avatar form looks like it's--

4226
05:07:44,956 --> 05:07:47,146
JOE: It's about to go.

4227
05:07:47,146 --> 05:07:49,218
MATT: It's pretty bad.

4228
05:07:49,218 --> 05:07:51,016
TALIESIN: Yeah, we do not want to kill him.

4229
05:07:51,016 --> 05:07:55,320
MARISHA: Oh, I had bonuses to saving throws that I
didn't even fucking realize. It's pretty good.

4230
05:07:55,320 --> 05:07:56,571
23.

4231
05:07:56,571 --> 05:08:05,748
JOE: Sorry, on saving throws, anyone within ten
feet of me gains plus four.

4232
05:08:05,748 --> 05:08:11,461
MATT: So you now have Arkhan grappling a hand, you
have Grog grappling the side of the torso.

4233
05:08:11,461 --> 05:08:16,796
Keyleth, you turn over and grapple part of the
body. You guys are basically holding Vecna at bay

4234
05:08:16,796 --> 05:08:17,968
at the moment.

4235
05:08:17,968 --> 05:08:19,690
SAM: We can always bring you back.

4236
05:08:19,690 --> 05:08:21,725
MATT: Is that your turn, Keyleth?

4237
05:08:21,725 --> 05:08:27,329
MARISHA: I don't even know what I have that would
make him burn it. I don't really have anything. I

4238
05:08:27,329 --> 05:08:29,288
don't think he would go for it.

4239
05:08:29,288 --> 05:08:35,395
TALIESIN: This just means we have to live through
one roll. I'm holding my action for any movement

4240
05:08:35,395 --> 05:08:42,078
or anything that he may do. I'm holding my action
for signs of life.

4241
05:08:42,078 --> 05:08:56,284
MATT: Scanlan, it's your turn.

4242
05:08:56,284 --> 05:09:05,355
SAM: Chapter One: The rites of banishment are
ancient and powerful. They cannot be stopped by

4243
05:09:05,355 --> 05:09:11,038
anyone, not even a god. I read. I read powerfully
and strong.

4244
05:09:11,038 --> 05:09:16,251
MATT: All right. He's going to make his wisdom
saving throw with a DC 20 because of two trammels.

4245
05:09:16,251 --> 05:09:25,569
That is a 17. He's going to use his last legendary
resistance to succeed.

4246
05:09:25,569 --> 05:09:27,208
TALIESIN: Next round.

4247
05:09:27,208 --> 05:09:34,407
MATT: The text goes blurred to you on the book, so
you cannot read it for a full round. Somebody else could.

4248
05:09:34,407 --> 05:09:35,884
MARISHA: A full round.

4249
05:09:35,884 --> 05:09:39,215
JOE: What is the basis of reading that thing?

4250
05:09:39,215 --> 05:09:43,158
SAM: Someone needs to cast a 3rd-level spell on
it.

4251
05:09:43,158 --> 05:09:44,751
LAURA: I have 3rd-levels left.

4252
05:09:44,751 --> 05:09:47,387
MATT: It's still glowing. The text is glowing for
an hour.

4253
05:09:47,387 --> 05:09:50,155
MARISHA: It's an arcane thing though, right?

4254
05:09:50,155 --> 05:09:52,285
SAM: I can't read it, but other people can?

4255
05:09:52,285 --> 05:09:59,982
MATT: Once you've put the spell slot into it, the
text becomes visible.

4256
05:09:59,982 --> 05:10:03,027
LAURA: Which you did.

4257
05:10:03,027 --> 05:10:04,206
SAM: I did that.

4258
05:10:04,206 --> 05:10:05,089
MATT: Correct.

4259
05:10:05,089 --> 05:10:08,600
TALIESIN: So now you can only try and read it.
Anybody can try and read it any six seconds as

4260
05:10:08,600 --> 05:10:10,850
long as it-- What language is it, again?

4261
05:10:10,850 --> 05:10:13,285
JOE: If you fail, then you can't read it for a
round.

4262
05:10:13,285 --> 05:10:16,439
MATT: Is anybody else here trained in arcana?

4263
05:10:16,439 --> 05:10:18,874
LIAM: <i>Trained</i> in arcana?

4264
05:10:18,874 --> 05:10:23,932
MARISHA: That was what I was asking. None of us
are, unless you are, Arkhan.

4265
05:10:23,932 --> 05:10:28,561
JOE: Arkhan does not have an arcana.

4266
05:10:28,561 --> 05:10:32,344
MARISHA: So we have to hold this motherfucker down
for a round?

4267
05:10:32,344 --> 05:10:33,596
MATT: You do.

4268
05:10:33,596 --> 05:10:38,113
SAM: Is Pike-- No, she's divinely--

4269
05:10:38,113 --> 05:10:41,554
MATT: I don't know. Pike, are you trained in
arcana? Do you have proficiency in arcana?

4270
05:10:41,554 --> 05:10:44,206
ASHLEY: I don't know. I don't think so.

4271
05:10:44,206 --> 05:10:49,574
JOE: Anyone else intelligent? What's that?

4272
05:10:49,574 --> 05:10:52,347
TRAVIS: You're grappling him too, right?

4273
05:10:52,347 --> 05:10:54,003
TALIESIN: So long as you guys all hold--

4274
05:10:54,003 --> 05:10:58,647
MATT: This text is far too illegible for somebody
who isn't trained in arcana.

4275
05:10:58,647 --> 05:11:04,960
MARISHA: Hang on, is it something I can do as a
planetar that can read all languages and is also

4276
05:11:04,960 --> 05:11:06,015
telepathic?

4277
05:11:06,015 --> 05:11:08,752
MATT: Planetars can read all languages?

4278
05:11:08,752 --> 05:11:09,888
MARISHA: Yeah.

4279
05:11:09,888 --> 05:11:11,146
MATT: You can certainly try.

4280
05:11:11,146 --> 05:11:15,314
LAURA: Give it a try, Keyleth. Because what
difference does it make? You have nothing to lose.

4281
05:11:15,314 --> 05:11:18,413
MATT: So at the end of Scanlan's turn--

4282
05:11:18,413 --> 05:11:20,355
SAM: Wait. Is anyone else?

4283
05:11:20,355 --> 05:11:23,247
MARISHA: I can read all languages as a planetar.

4284
05:11:23,247 --> 05:11:27,539
JOE: It's like the scene in Monster Squad when the
kid goes, "Is she a virgin?"

4285
05:11:27,539 --> 05:11:30,112
MATT: At the end of Scanlan's turn--

4286
05:11:30,112 --> 05:11:35,999
SAM: I cast my bonus action inspiration on
Keyleth.

4287
05:11:35,999 --> 05:11:38,813
MATT: Okay. How do you inspire her?

4288
05:11:38,813 --> 05:11:48,772
SAM: (singing) Here's the story. Of a lovely
druid. Who thought she could fly as a goldfish.

4289
05:11:48,772 --> 05:11:58,679
But she couldn't, and she became fish paste. And I
wish I had Wish.

4290
05:11:58,679 --> 05:12:02,723
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration die.

4291
05:12:02,723 --> 05:12:06,259
MARISHA: Okay. I have it now.

4292
05:12:06,259 --> 05:12:12,067
MATT: Okay. End of Scanlan's turn. Going to use
two legendary actions to attempt to cast Dominate

4293
05:12:12,067 --> 05:12:13,071
Person.

4294
05:12:13,071 --> 05:12:14,528
TALIESIN: Can he do it without arms?

4295
05:12:14,528 --> 05:12:19,326
MATT: Well, not both arms are currently grappled
to the point where the arms can't move.

4296
05:12:19,326 --> 05:12:23,093
TALIESIN: Okay, because there's a lot of people
grappling him.

4297
05:12:23,093 --> 05:12:27,791
MATT: He's also a very big guy. Grappling is more
of holding onto him and preventing him from

4298
05:12:27,791 --> 05:12:33,394
moving, but he can still move. It's a hard thing.
It's a little wishy-washy at this size. All right,

4299
05:12:33,394 --> 05:12:40,425
so Scanlan, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

4300
05:12:40,425 --> 05:12:42,374
SAM: I'll cast Counterspell.

4301
05:12:42,374 --> 05:12:44,342
MATT: At what level?

4302
05:12:44,342 --> 05:12:45,710
SAM: Three.

4303
05:12:45,710 --> 05:12:47,961
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

4304
05:12:47,961 --> 05:12:51,173
(shouting)

4305
05:12:51,173 --> 05:12:53,540
TALIESIN: What!

4306
05:12:53,540 --> 05:13:00,369
MARISHA: For no reason.

4307
05:13:00,369 --> 05:13:05,271
JOE: Scanlan has had the craziest last hour ever!

4308
05:13:05,271 --> 05:13:08,887
TALIESIN: Can't deal.

4309
05:13:08,887 --> 05:13:14,449
LIAM: Oh my god.

4310
05:13:14,449 --> 05:13:18,047
JOE: You just killed, dude.

4311
05:13:18,047 --> 05:13:22,122
MARISHA: Oh my gods. Oh my Pelor. Oh my Sarenrae.

4312
05:13:22,122 --> 05:13:28,551
MATT: So now it's Pike's turn. Pike, your turn.

4313
05:13:28,551 --> 05:13:36,104
ASHLEY: Okay. Am I close to Keyleth at all?

4314
05:13:36,104 --> 05:13:40,641
MATT: Yeah. You're actually right up there with
Keyleth.

4315
05:13:40,641 --> 05:13:46,007
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to float by Keyleth.

4316
05:13:46,007 --> 05:13:48,226
MATT: What are you doing?

4317
05:13:48,226 --> 05:13:54,299
ASHLEY: I'm going to float by Keyleth. Cast
Guidance on her.

4318
05:13:54,299 --> 05:13:55,817
MATT: Okay.

4319
05:13:55,817 --> 05:14:02,688
ASHLEY: And as a bonus action, cast Sanctuary on
her.

4320
05:14:02,688 --> 05:14:12,293
MATT: Okay. All right. That finish your turn,
Pike?

4321
05:14:12,293 --> 05:14:14,129
ASHLEY: Yes.

4322
05:14:14,129 --> 05:14:15,470
MATT: All right.

4323
05:14:15,470 --> 05:14:17,113
ASHLEY: Can I move again?

4324
05:14:17,113 --> 05:14:20,490
MATT: You can move if you want.

4325
05:14:20,490 --> 05:14:22,873
ASHLEY: I want to move close to Grog.

4326
05:14:22,873 --> 05:14:29,380
MATT: Okay. That's easy enough. You guys are all
clustered around him. Okay. That ends Pike's turn.

4327
05:14:29,380 --> 05:14:36,034
End of your turn, he's going to use two more
legendary actions to attempt to cast 4th-level

4328
05:14:36,034 --> 05:14:40,452
Banishment on Scanlan. He's running through what
things he can.

4329
05:14:40,452 --> 05:14:46,372
MARISHA: 4th-level Banishment on Scanlan?

4330
05:14:46,372 --> 05:14:53,180
MATT: All right. Make a charisma saving throw,
please.

4331
05:14:53,180 --> 05:14:55,189
MARISHA: Come on, charisma.

4332
05:14:55,189 --> 05:14:58,364
LIAM: Burt Reynolds, do it.

4333
05:14:58,364 --> 05:15:07,050
SAM: 30. I'm charisma as fuck!

4334
05:15:07,050 --> 05:15:10,169
(laughter)

4335
05:15:10,169 --> 05:15:12,760
JOE: This is craziness!

4336
05:15:12,760 --> 05:15:15,952
SAM: First roll two. Second roll 18.

4337
05:15:15,952 --> 05:15:21,023
JOE: We got to go to Vegas after this is done!

4338
05:15:21,023 --> 05:15:27,811
MATT: Top of the round. Vecna's turn. Legendary
actions are returned. At this point now, the titan

4339
05:15:27,811 --> 05:15:33,613
has waded into the center of Vasselheim. Each
progressive round, it's been this one footstep

4340
05:15:33,613 --> 05:15:37,774
after the other. You can hear screams and yells,
but you also see the divine temples in the

4341
05:15:37,774 --> 05:15:42,167
distance are beginning to summon various bits of
divine energy from those in the clerics that

4342
05:15:42,167 --> 05:15:46,982
reside within the city. You can see a storm has
now merged with the darkness that Vecna has spread

4343
05:15:46,982 --> 05:15:51,185
over the city, and lightning bolts are beginning
to be brought down in a familiar crack that you

4344
05:15:51,185 --> 05:15:56,763
heard when you were battling Groon. As you can see
now, the acolytes of the recently fallen Trial

4345
05:15:56,763 --> 05:16:02,402
Forge are bringing their rage down upon the
exterior of this entire swarm of gloomstalkers and

4346
05:16:02,402 --> 05:16:03,630
the titan.

4347
05:16:03,630 --> 05:16:14,498
Vecna is going to try again. He's going to cast
another Banishment on Scanlan. "Would you just be

4348
05:16:14,498 --> 05:16:21,640
"rid of me, finally? Go! Die!" Make another
charisma saving throw.

4349
05:16:21,640 --> 05:16:24,419
TRAVIS: Does Vecna have to speak to cast
Banishment?

4350
05:16:24,419 --> 05:16:29,072
SAM: Not good. Not good, both.

4351
05:16:29,072 --> 05:16:35,002
JOE: Does anyone have anything that negates--

4352
05:16:35,002 --> 05:16:36,814
TALIESIN: You can inspire yourself.

4353
05:16:36,814 --> 05:16:42,085
MATT: Well, not for a saving throw, he can't. What
did you roll?

4354
05:16:42,085 --> 05:16:43,669
SAM: 18.

4355
05:16:43,669 --> 05:16:51,186
MATT: Scanlan, with the book, vanishes from sight.
At this point, Vecna, who's being held by all,

4356
05:16:51,186 --> 05:16:57,490
(chuckles) "Come on, show me what you're worth."

4357
05:16:57,490 --> 05:17:01,319
TRAVIS: I'll do that right now. I'll use my
reaction against mage slayer, and I'm going to

4358
05:17:01,319 --> 05:17:03,706
punch him in the face. Just punch.

4359
05:17:03,706 --> 05:17:13,115
MATT: At this point, you watch as one of the
titan's arms is now rising up over the tower. You

4360
05:17:13,115 --> 05:17:17,340
get the sense he's getting really desperate.

4361
05:17:17,340 --> 05:17:21,107
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. Just trying to break
concentration, so I'm going to (punch).

4362
05:17:21,107 --> 05:17:23,047
SAM: Do what you've got to do.

4363
05:17:23,047 --> 05:17:24,697
MATT: Go for it, Grog.

4364
05:17:24,697 --> 05:17:26,286
TRAVIS: Reckless.

4365
05:17:26,286 --> 05:17:33,432
MATT: As Vecna's lifting his right hand up, even
in the grasp, you can see the titan's arm rising

4366
05:17:33,432 --> 05:17:38,829
up like it's being puppeteered by Vecna as it puts
another shadow down upon the top of Entropis. This

4367
05:17:38,829 --> 05:17:43,120
large multi-hundred-foot-wide ram of sheer rock.
All right.

4368
05:17:43,120 --> 05:17:47,626
TRAVIS: 25 to hit. 1d4. Three plus eight.

4369
05:17:47,626 --> 05:17:49,296
MATT: Total damage is?

4370
05:17:49,296 --> 05:17:51,428
TRAVIS: 11.

4371
05:17:51,428 --> 05:17:53,932
MATT: 11? Okay.

4372
05:17:53,932 --> 05:17:56,338
TRAVIS: He's got to roll at disadvantage.

4373
05:17:56,338 --> 05:18:03,549
MATT: He does. 12 and 12 plus seven each. So yeah,
he succeeds. That's the end of Vecna's turn, who's

4374
05:18:03,549 --> 05:18:05,527
locked in place. Now it's your turn, Grog.

4375
05:18:05,527 --> 05:18:08,022
TALIESIN: He has healed 50, though, in theory.

4376
05:18:08,022 --> 05:18:09,758
MATT: He did. He healed 50 hit points in the last
turn.

4377
05:18:09,758 --> 05:18:11,293
SAM: So hit him 50 points, Grog.

4378
05:18:11,293 --> 05:18:19,276
TRAVIS: All right. I'll hit him with the sword of
Kas. Reckless. That's a critical. That was a 19.

4379
05:18:19,276 --> 05:18:23,634
I'm not used to hitting on those. Oh shit.

4380
05:18:23,634 --> 05:18:25,991
LAURA: Oh no. Just the one to break his
concentration.

4381
05:18:25,991 --> 05:18:27,743
SAM: Roll high.

4382
05:18:27,743 --> 05:18:29,003
TRAVIS: I already rolled high.

4383
05:18:29,003 --> 05:18:30,315
LIAM: Close your eyes.

4384
05:18:30,315 --> 05:18:33,952
MARISHA: It didn't help for me earlier; I rolled a
three.

4385
05:18:33,952 --> 05:18:35,684
LIAM: Close your eyes.

4386
05:18:35,684 --> 05:18:41,732
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me. Oh shit. 28.

4387
05:18:41,732 --> 05:18:43,274
LAURA: Oh my god.

4388
05:18:43,274 --> 05:19:02,477
TRAVIS: 36. That's a one, but I've got to re-roll
it. 42. Yeah. 58.

4389
05:19:02,477 --> 05:19:05,709
TALIESIN: Yeah. He wasn't like 20 points away.

4390
05:19:05,709 --> 05:19:15,141
MATT: Okay. So he has to make a DC at half that,
which is going to be DC of 24.

4391
05:19:15,141 --> 05:19:17,863
TALIESIN: Disadvantage.

4392
05:19:17,863 --> 05:19:19,549
MATT: Well, no. Not on this.

4393
05:19:19,549 --> 05:19:22,657
TRAVIS: On saving throws? If I damage you--

4394
05:19:22,657 --> 05:19:24,937
MATT: Oh. Any time with mage slayer? Oh, that's
right!

4395
05:19:24,937 --> 05:19:28,882
TRAVIS: When you damage a creature that's-- yep.

4396
05:19:28,882 --> 05:19:30,303
MATT: 18 to a natural one.

4397
05:19:30,303 --> 05:19:32,944
(shouting)

4398
05:19:32,944 --> 05:19:36,923
MATT: Man, that's crazy.

4399
05:19:36,923 --> 05:19:40,359
SAM: You made this world, Matt.

4400
05:19:40,359 --> 05:19:49,093
MATT: Yeah, I know. And with that, Scanlan appears
back in place.

4401
05:19:49,093 --> 05:19:54,408
TRAVIS: I will forego the rest of my turn.

4402
05:19:54,408 --> 05:19:59,147
MATT: Oh shit. Okay, that's the end of Grog's
turn. Vex?

4403
05:19:59,147 --> 05:20:01,685
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4404
05:20:01,685 --> 05:20:06,767
TALIESIN: Huddle in fear at this point.

4405
05:20:06,767 --> 05:20:07,744
LAURA: Yeah, right?

4406
05:20:07,744 --> 05:20:09,101
TALIESIN: Hi. I'm back there. Come join me.

4407
05:20:09,101 --> 05:20:11,015
MARISHA: I use my action to go fetal.

4408
05:20:11,015 --> 05:20:13,213
LAURA: What's your health at?

4409
05:20:13,213 --> 05:20:14,599
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I'm 88.

4410
05:20:14,599 --> 05:20:16,341
MARISHA: That's under a hundred, though.

4411
05:20:16,341 --> 05:20:36,831
LAURA: I know. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at
3rd-level on Percy. Six, nine. So 11. No, 12, sorry.

4412
05:20:36,831 --> 05:20:39,817
MATT: Okay. That's your turn.

4413
05:20:39,817 --> 05:20:42,957
LAURA: For my bonus action, I'm going to take a
greater healing potion.

4414
05:20:42,957 --> 05:20:45,687
MATT: Go for it. Okay.

4415
05:20:45,687 --> 05:20:47,392
LAURA: So that's 4d4.

4416
05:20:47,392 --> 05:20:49,286
MATT: Are you going to move, as well?

4417
05:20:49,286 --> 05:21:02,290
LAURA: Yes. Whoa, that's good. 11 plus four is 15
to me. And then I'm going to run over to Percy,

4418
05:21:02,290 --> 05:21:04,972
and I'm going to hold his hand.

4419
05:21:04,972 --> 05:21:10,374
MATT: Just enough movement to come over and hold
Percy's hand.

4420
05:21:10,374 --> 05:21:13,824
LAURA: But I'm going to keep looking up at what's
going on up there.

4421
05:21:13,824 --> 05:21:18,432
MATT: Okay. As you guys stand there looking up,
hand in hand, glaring as Scanlan reappears in

4422
05:21:18,432 --> 05:21:24,184
place, and with the shadow now looming over
Entropis in a long line across the city of Thar

4423
05:21:24,184 --> 05:21:30,150
Amphala as this massive titan arm is rising up.
That's going to end that. Vax, what are you

4424
05:21:30,150 --> 05:21:31,460
doing?

4425
05:21:31,460 --> 05:21:36,494
LIAM: Okay. I would like to cast Compelled Duel on
Vecna. It's a long shot, but I'm going to do it.

4426
05:21:36,494 --> 05:21:38,231
MARISHA: The fuck is that?

4427
05:21:38,231 --> 05:21:43,451
LIAM: One creature that you can see within range
must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,

4428
05:21:43,451 --> 05:21:45,815
the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your
divine demand.

4429
05:21:45,815 --> 05:21:47,360
JOE: It's a weird paladin spell.

4430
05:21:47,360 --> 05:21:49,181
TRAVIS: There's always a one out there.

4431
05:21:49,181 --> 05:21:50,425
LIAM: So I would like to do it.

4432
05:21:50,425 --> 05:21:54,631
MATT: All right. That is a 24.

4433
05:21:54,631 --> 05:22:02,193
LIAM: Sure. Okay. So that didn't work. For my
action, I would like to steal a bonus kiss from

4434
05:22:02,193 --> 05:22:03,994
Keyleth of the Air Ashari.

4435
05:22:03,994 --> 05:22:09,315
MATT: I don't believe you've kissed her in her
Keytar form, so it's a new experience for you.

4436
05:22:09,315 --> 05:22:18,825
LIAM: Every different form-- male, female, big,
tall, small, whatever-- I'm in love. And I would

4437
05:22:18,825 --> 05:22:26,069
like to use my regular action to fly in front of
Scanlan Shorthalt, five feet in front of him, and

4438
05:22:26,069 --> 05:22:32,594
splay my wings as wide as they can and flip the
double birds to the biggest dick on the fucking

4439
05:22:32,594 --> 05:22:33,871
planet.

4440
05:22:33,871 --> 05:22:36,682
MARISHA: (air horns)

4441
05:22:36,682 --> 05:22:38,424
LIAM: In front of Scanlan.

4442
05:22:38,424 --> 05:22:44,531
MATT: The tape is wearing off. It's worked well
enough for most of it. Vecna's going to take

4443
05:22:44,531 --> 05:22:46,477
attack of opportunity on you as you rush by.

4444
05:22:46,477 --> 05:22:47,841
LIAM: Good.

4445
05:22:47,841 --> 05:22:51,715
JOE: Can he take an attack of opportunity
physically with me hanging onto his hand and her

4446
05:22:51,715 --> 05:22:54,621
on the other hand? I'm just along for the ride?

4447
05:22:54,621 --> 05:23:08,485
MATT: You're swung along as he strikes. (screams)
Swing in place. That's going to be a ten. There we

4448
05:23:08,485 --> 05:23:10,170
go. 27.

4449
05:23:10,170 --> 05:23:12,561
LIAM: That hits. I'll use uncanny dodge to reduce
it to half.

4450
05:23:12,561 --> 05:23:25,001
MATT: Okay. All right. That is 24 points of cold
damage, and you're immune to paralysis, so it

4451
05:23:25,001 --> 05:23:30,787
doesn't do anything else. All right. Arkhan.

4452
05:23:30,787 --> 05:23:53,694
JOE: Okay. Everyone's appeared. I'm grappled.
There's nothing to be done here. Can I hold

4453
05:23:53,694 --> 05:23:57,820
movement or is it hold action?

4454
05:23:57,820 --> 05:23:59,002
MATT: Just an action.

4455
05:23:59,002 --> 05:24:00,764
SAM: You have to name the action.

4456
05:24:00,764 --> 05:24:11,175
JOE: Okay. I will hold my action in case he
disappears.

4457
05:24:11,175 --> 05:24:15,931
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, it's your turn.

4458
05:24:15,931 --> 05:24:26,403
MARISHA: Okay. I fly down over Scanlan's shoulder
and attempt to read the damn book.

4459
05:24:26,403 --> 05:24:29,609
MATT: You probably have to take the tome from him
to read it.

4460
05:24:29,609 --> 05:24:33,948
JOE: Wings in front, wings in back? This is crazy.
This is a cool tableau.

4461
05:24:33,948 --> 05:24:46,834
MATT: Scanlan's being held up by Bigby's Hand in
the center. Black-winged angel of fate and death

4462
05:24:46,834 --> 05:24:49,624
on one side. The white-winged planetar of Keyleth
representing life on the other.

4463
05:24:49,624 --> 05:24:51,186
MARISHA: With antlers. Always antlers.

4464
05:24:51,186 --> 05:24:55,190
MATT: You take the book from Scanlan. You spend
your action to try and read it?

4465
05:24:55,190 --> 05:24:56,872
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

4466
05:24:56,872 --> 05:24:58,690
MATT: Which you can, because your planetar form--

4467
05:24:58,690 --> 05:25:04,714
MARISHA: Do I get anything? What do I do?

4468
05:25:04,714 --> 05:25:06,657
SAM: Nothing.

4469
05:25:06,657 --> 05:25:09,960
MARISHA: I've got inspiration and d4, right?

4470
05:25:09,960 --> 05:25:14,042
MATT: You just read it. It's his saving throw.

4471
05:25:14,042 --> 05:25:15,387
MARISHA: He saves.

4472
05:25:15,387 --> 05:25:21,320
MATT: He saves. You just read it. You begin to
recite from the text like Scanlan did. As the

4473
05:25:21,320 --> 05:25:26,555
mysterious words begin to emit from the--

4474
05:25:26,555 --> 05:25:28,083
TRAVIS: What is it?

4475
05:25:28,083 --> 05:25:31,298
MATT: Let me take a quick picture of this.

4476
05:25:31,298 --> 05:25:34,435
MARISHA: What does that mean? It's always good or
bad.

4477
05:25:34,435 --> 05:25:50,768
[music]

4478
05:25:50,768 --> 05:26:00,642
TALIESIN: Should be texting that fast.

4479
05:26:00,642 --> 05:26:05,292
MATT: As you read from the book, page after page,
the words come out, something you don't seem to

4480
05:26:05,292 --> 05:26:16,344
understand in your mind, but the form understands,
and as it does, the runes glow. You look up as the

4481
05:26:16,344 --> 05:26:27,395
trammels begin to glow. One, two. You hear this
sucking sound.

4482
05:26:27,395 --> 05:26:29,102
How do you guys want to do this?

4483
05:26:29,102 --> 05:26:34,612
(shouting)

4484
05:26:34,612 --> 05:26:39,265
LAURA: Oh my god.

4485
05:26:39,265 --> 05:26:46,157
MATT: Describe your support of this. You guys are
holding Vecna back. How do you prepare for this,

4486
05:26:46,157 --> 05:26:48,904
as he's currently being held by these trammels in
place?

4487
05:26:48,904 --> 05:26:50,906
LAURA: I grab Percy up on the broom so we can fly
up.

4488
05:26:50,906 --> 05:26:57,674
TRAVIS: I take out the immovable rod out of the
bag of holding, and I put the heel of my hand

4489
05:26:57,674 --> 05:27:00,406
against the trammel as it starts to push, just to
help it.

4490
05:27:00,406 --> 05:27:08,842
LIAM: I grab Scanlan like a football for old
times' sake and I come up behind Keyleth and I

4491
05:27:08,842 --> 05:27:10,930
kiss her on the cheek and stare forward.

4492
05:27:10,930 --> 05:27:14,260
MARISHA: We all spoon each other as a winged
spooning circle while holding Scanlan while

4493
05:27:14,260 --> 05:27:15,587
holding the book.

4494
05:27:15,587 --> 05:27:18,401
SAM: Bigby's Hand is gently tickling my taint.

4495
05:27:18,401 --> 05:27:20,994
(laughter)

4496
05:27:20,994 --> 05:27:23,620
TRAVIS: I make sure Pike's with me over here.

4497
05:27:23,620 --> 05:27:28,200
ASHLEY: Yeah. I fly up next to Grog, and if he has
a free hand, I hold the other hand.

4498
05:27:28,200 --> 05:27:30,500
TRAVIS: Yeah. I hold hands with Pike.

4499
05:27:30,500 --> 05:27:36,826
MATT: As you guys are there, clutching him in this
form, you watch as suddenly the dark clouds above

4500
05:27:36,826 --> 05:27:44,436
begin to part directly above the tower as the
titan arm is lifted up and beginning to make its

4501
05:27:44,436 --> 05:27:50,840
way down in your direction as the shadow
strengthens. The trammels (explosion) in the side

4502
05:27:50,840 --> 05:28:03,863
of the head. "No. Too long. <i>Too long!</i>" (agonized
yell) As they suddenly vibrantly brighten, you

4503
05:28:03,863 --> 05:28:09,722
watch as the lattice of the Divine Gate begins to
spread out around his body, the energy begin to

4504
05:28:09,722 --> 05:28:17,654
consume his form. And within one bright, fiery,
sun explosion-like flash and a sound like a

4505
05:28:17,654 --> 05:28:23,104
deafening thunderclap not feet from where your
body is, all of you are thrown from the detonation

4506
05:28:23,104 --> 05:28:26,405
as Vecna claps out of existence.

4507
05:28:26,405 --> 05:28:45,691
You all begin to fall as the entirety of the field
dissipates around Thar Amphala. The first sunlight

4508
05:28:45,691 --> 05:28:57,478
probably ever to really touch the city hits. As
you watch, waves of gloomstalkers dissipate as the

4509
05:28:57,478 --> 05:29:08,525
cloud slowly pulls away. The large titan arm
grinds to a halt from above as its entire undead

4510
05:29:08,525 --> 05:29:15,632
body halts, locked in place, the magic that
maintained it no longer of this plane.

4511
05:29:15,632 --> 05:29:31,022
You fall. There is a platform not too far from
you. I would like those who were clasping on to

4512
05:29:31,022 --> 05:29:37,025
Vecna to make a strength saving throw to try and
capture yourself on the edge.

4513
05:29:37,025 --> 05:29:40,191
JOE: Is anyone within ten feet of me?

4514
05:29:40,191 --> 05:29:43,332
LAURA: Grog and Pike are.

4515
05:29:43,332 --> 05:29:45,024
JOE: You get a plus four.

4516
05:29:45,024 --> 05:29:46,376
TRAVIS: Sick.

4517
05:29:46,376 --> 05:29:48,322
ASHLEY: Am I rolling, as well?

4518
05:29:48,322 --> 05:29:51,645
MATT: You're flying; you're fine.

4519
05:29:51,645 --> 05:29:55,482
SAM: Can J'mon catch anyone?

4520
05:29:55,482 --> 05:30:02,642
MATT: Unfortunately, the force cage is still in
place. It lasts for an hour.

4521
05:30:02,642 --> 05:30:08,288
TRAVIS: I rolled a 22.

4522
05:30:08,288 --> 05:30:11,169
MATT: 22, okay.

4523
05:30:11,169 --> 05:30:13,402
JOE: 17.

4524
05:30:13,402 --> 05:30:21,920
MATT: Okay. You both manage to barely catch on to
the edge. The strain is immense, and you both

4525
05:30:21,920 --> 05:30:36,516
still manage to suffer 23 points of general strain
damage. Technically, it's the fall damage, but you

4526
05:30:36,516 --> 05:30:45,792
caught yourself. You barely pull yourself back up
onto these platforms. The tethers still remain,

4527
05:30:45,792 --> 05:30:49,214
holding it, but you don't know how long it'll be
there, as the energy is subsiding around this

4528
05:30:49,214 --> 05:30:50,545
tower.

4529
05:30:50,545 --> 05:31:02,179
You all take a moment to imagine what you've lost,
what you've gained. Everything has led to this

4530
05:31:02,179 --> 05:31:19,608
moment. And in the quiet and the stillness, you
hear a new sound. It's thousands and thousands of

4531
05:31:19,608 --> 05:31:30,089
distant voices cheering from the city of
Vasselheim below. Of wyvern and eagle riders above

4532
05:31:30,089 --> 05:31:45,039
you. But a small example of the hundreds of
thousands of lives you may have saved.

4533
05:31:45,039 --> 05:31:53,359
LAURA: I'm staring at Vax.

4534
05:31:53,359 --> 05:31:56,258
MARISHA: Same. Holding on desperately.

4535
05:31:56,258 --> 05:31:58,557
MATT: Anyone else do anything?

4536
05:31:58,557 --> 05:32:05,901
SAM: Yeah. I go up to Vax. Palm over to him.

4537
05:32:05,901 --> 05:32:14,495
MATT: The hand did come off, actually. The body
vanished, but the hand, the artifact still remains

4538
05:32:14,495 --> 05:32:15,766
behind.

4539
05:32:15,766 --> 05:32:22,534
JOE: Then it's time to destroy this thing once and
for all. I kneel down, and I place the hand down

4540
05:32:22,534 --> 05:32:34,003
on the ground. I raise my axe above my head and I
say a prayer to Tiamat. And I bring the axe down

4541
05:32:34,003 --> 05:32:38,879
and chop my hand off, put Vecna's hand on, use my
healing pool to heal, and teleport out. I'm sorry,

4542
05:32:38,879 --> 05:32:45,123
it was just business. Until we meet again.

4543
05:32:45,123 --> 05:32:47,884
MARISHA: Wait. What?

4544
05:32:47,884 --> 05:32:55,770
TALIESIN: Did we just get janked? We just got
robbed! It's hard to get out of here, isn't it?

4545
05:32:55,770 --> 05:33:02,877
MATT: (laughing) You guys watch as Arkhan--

4546
05:33:02,877 --> 05:33:05,215
LIAM: See you in the next campaign, motherfucker!

4547
05:33:05,215 --> 05:33:09,240
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4548
05:33:09,240 --> 05:33:12,307
LIAM: Power move!

4549
05:33:12,307 --> 05:33:14,283
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4550
05:33:14,283 --> 05:33:18,038
TALIESIN: Okay, that just happened.

4551
05:33:18,038 --> 05:33:28,240
MARISHA: All right, you know. Yeah. Don't
congratulate him! Don't encourage that!

4552
05:33:28,240 --> 05:33:40,040
MATT: Without even the mental strength, the
emotional strength to take in the ramifications of

4553
05:33:40,040 --> 05:33:51,669
what just transpired, you all look to each other
in this moment of victory. A year's journey. And

4554
05:33:51,669 --> 05:33:54,570
you breathe a sigh of relief, true relief.

4555
05:33:54,570 --> 05:34:03,099
And that's where we're going to end tonight's
game. We'll pick up on this next week. Holy shit,

4556
05:34:03,099 --> 05:34:04,705
you guys.

4557
05:34:04,705 --> 05:34:08,733
TALIESIN: What. Holy fuck, man.

4558
05:34:08,733 --> 05:34:15,296
TRAVIS: Holy cow.

4559
05:34:15,296 --> 05:34:21,104
MATT: You are the luckiest motherfucker, I swear
to god.

4560
05:34:21,104 --> 05:34:25,271
TRAVIS: "Ooh, but I dispelled it. That's why I
moved closer."

4561
05:34:25,271 --> 05:34:29,132
LIAM: Lucky and smart.

4562
05:34:29,132 --> 05:34:31,087
MATT: All of you guys.

4563
05:34:31,087 --> 05:34:33,867
TRAVIS: MVP'ed it.

4564
05:34:33,867 --> 05:34:35,833
SAM: You trained us all.

4565
05:34:35,833 --> 05:34:38,912
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We learned it from watching
you.

4566
05:34:38,912 --> 05:34:40,990
SAM: Yep, we did.

4567
05:34:40,990 --> 05:34:42,881
TALIESIN: Wow.

4568
05:34:42,881 --> 05:34:52,398
MATT: Okay. Well, on that note, those of you who
are still with us, thank you for being so

4569
05:34:52,398 --> 05:34:53,837
patient.

4570
05:34:53,837 --> 05:34:56,815
SAM: "Those of you who are still with us?" It's
fucking everybody.

4571
05:34:56,815 --> 05:34:59,528
MATT: I hope so. I know it's been long. We're at
12:40.

4572
05:34:59,528 --> 05:35:01,357
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is late.

4573
05:35:01,357 --> 05:35:02,537
LAURA: It is so late.

4574
05:35:02,537 --> 05:35:06,218
MATT: But what a way to finish a final boss, man.

4575
05:35:06,218 --> 05:35:11,349
LIAM: I didn't use two of my luck. I saved them!

4576
05:35:11,349 --> 05:35:16,402
TRAVIS: After all this time, you finally saved
them.

4577
05:35:16,402 --> 05:35:19,671
MATT: As a note, he had ten hit points left.

4578
05:35:19,671 --> 05:35:22,218
(gasping)

4579
05:35:22,218 --> 05:35:25,277
TALIESIN: Okay, that could have gone real bad.

4580
05:35:25,277 --> 05:35:26,854
LIAM: Real bad.

4581
05:35:26,854 --> 05:35:30,587
MATT: And his ability discorporation. When Vecna
drops to zero hit points, his avatar form is

4582
05:35:30,587 --> 05:35:35,470
destroyed but his essence travels back to his
phylactery demiplane just beyond the Prime

4583
05:35:35,470 --> 05:35:37,844
Material, and he is unable to take physical form
for a time.

4584
05:35:37,844 --> 05:35:42,636
TRAVIS: That punch was <i>super</i> close.

4585
05:35:42,636 --> 05:35:43,924
LAURA: But he would have still been a god,
technically?

4586
05:35:43,924 --> 05:35:44,977
MATT: Yeah.

4587
05:35:44,977 --> 05:35:46,041
LAURA: Oh my god.

4588
05:35:46,041 --> 05:35:46,930
ASHLEY: Ugh.

4589
05:35:46,930 --> 05:35:50,048
LIAM: We would have had to have done five more games
for this thing to end.

4590
05:35:50,048 --> 05:35:51,911
MATT: This would have gone into a few more
sessions, and he would have come back with far

4591
05:35:51,911 --> 05:35:54,504
more knowledge and far more preparation before
he's up against you guys.

4592
05:35:54,504 --> 05:35:56,120
TALIESIN: Yeah, nope.

4593
05:35:56,120 --> 05:36:01,705
SAM: Everyone was clutch. Pike.

4594
05:36:01,705 --> 05:36:03,302
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone.

4595
05:36:03,302 --> 05:36:09,450
SAM: Keyleth for the win. The most wisdom she's
ever had.

4596
05:36:09,450 --> 05:36:12,184
(laughter)

4597
05:36:12,184 --> 05:36:16,616
MARISHA: In another form. Can read all languages.

4598
05:36:16,616 --> 05:36:21,125
LIAM: Sam. You were trying to save a Wish for me?

4599
05:36:21,125 --> 05:36:23,177
ASHLEY: Matt!

4600
05:36:23,177 --> 05:36:25,872
TRAVIS: Yeah, the gnarliest map of all time.

4601
05:36:25,872 --> 05:36:28,149
MATT: I'm glad that worked out.

4602
05:36:28,149 --> 05:36:32,904
(applause)

4603
05:36:32,904 --> 05:36:37,561
MATT: All right. It's late.

4604
05:36:37,561 --> 05:36:38,781
TALIESIN: It's so late.

4605
05:36:38,781 --> 05:36:41,728
LAURA: I love you guys.

4606
05:36:41,728 --> 05:36:43,352
MATT: Love you guys.

4607
05:36:43,352 --> 05:36:44,684
TALIESIN: Love you.

4608
05:36:44,684 --> 05:36:47,957
TRAVIS: We pick this up next week.

4609
05:36:47,957 --> 05:36:50,561
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Oh, we ain't done.

4610
05:36:50,561 --> 05:36:53,649
LIAM: Yeah. I get to play the first two minutes of
the game.

4611
05:36:53,649 --> 05:36:55,379
LAURA and MATT: Shut up.

4612
05:36:55,379 --> 05:36:57,097
LIAM: Love you.

4613
05:36:57,097 --> 05:37:00,187
TRAVIS: Johnson, we love you.

4614
05:37:00,187 --> 05:37:01,983
LAURA: Johnson!

4615
05:37:01,983 --> 05:37:04,752
LIAM: We're so glad you were here from the start
of the game, Ash!

4616
05:37:04,752 --> 05:37:08,714
MATT: It's 3:30, 4:30.

4617
05:37:08,714 --> 05:37:10,732
LAURA: What time is your call in the morning?

4618
05:37:10,732 --> 05:37:12,164
ASHLEY: I don't have to work tomorrow.

4619
05:37:12,164 --> 05:37:14,281
(cheering)

4620
05:37:14,281 --> 05:37:17,805
MATT: Thank you Blindspot for releasing her early
enough to come play with us tonight.

4621
05:37:17,805 --> 05:37:19,435
TALIESIN: Thank you, Blindspot. Oh my god.

4622
05:37:19,435 --> 05:37:23,641
MATT: Thank you guys for watching. We'll pick this
up next week. Until then, rest well, we love you,

4623
05:37:23,641 --> 05:37:25,061
and is it Thursday yet?

4624
05:37:25,061 --> 05:37:26,255
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is.

4625
05:37:26,255 --> 05:44:46,912
