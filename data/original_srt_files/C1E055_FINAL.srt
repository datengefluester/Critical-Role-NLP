1
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:08,102
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:15,016
nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons
&amp; Dragons. So, welcome. I know we had a two-week

3
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:17,525
hiatus. We had some birthdays-- in fact, the twins
had a birthday.

4
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,801
(cheering)

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:25,104
MATT: Awesome. A lot of really amazing community
art came out of it, because you guys are

6
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:30,412
ridiculous, and we'll probably see some of that at
the break today. But before we kick into the

7
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:36,721
game, let's get through our announcements for the
evening while we also wait for Mr. Sam Riegel,

8
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:40,807
Scanlan, who I think we all can consider is pretty
important to tonight's events, seeing as how he's

9
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,194
currently being digested in the belly of the
dragon.

10
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:45,306
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh shit!

11
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:47,163
LIAM: That didn't happen.

12
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:58,638
MATT: Yes it did. Yes it did. No. So. Starting off
our announcements for the evening: first off, I am

13
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:03,489
going to be flying out bright and early tomorrow
morning to A-Kon in Dallas. I'll be out there

14
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,881
doing panels and signings with a bunch of other
great guests. I understand the same weekend is

15
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:14,832
also Dallas Comic Con, because what the fuck,
Dallas? At which Mary and Steve are there also, so

16
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:18,384
don't choose: come to both! No.

17
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:21,568
TRAVIS: Wade the waters.

18
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:26,301
MATT: Exactly. But I'll be doing signings, panels,
and meeting a bunch of you Critters that are out

19
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:29,793
in that area, so come by and say hi this weekend.
And if not, go say hi to Steve and Mary, wherever

20
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:32,735
that happens, in the lesser part of Dallas. I
don't know if it is, I just like--

21
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:36,929
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's a lesser part of Dallas,
totally, over with the lesser-- are you guys

22
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,847
throwing up because of how nervous you are?

23
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:42,156
LAURA: What? No. Oh, my dice! Where are my dice?!

24
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,283
MATT: Where are your dice?

25
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:44,846
LAURA: I'm so nervous, I don't even have my dice!

26
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:46,773
TRAVIS: I'll go find them, I'll go find them.

27
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:53,441
MATT: Travis is going to get them. Wow. Two weeks
to stew on this and it's already falling apart.

28
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,875
LIAM: This is the exact icy, steely demeanor that
I depend on.

29
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:04,130
LAURA: Oh my god, are they in there?

30
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,900
MATT: While he looks for those--

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,805
TALIESIN: I have extras, if you need some.

32
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:15,780
MATT: I do want to also say the newest Dear Abby
article series for Critical Role characters went

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,452
up-- or goes up tomorrow, right?

34
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:18,685
MARISHA: Tomorrow, Fridays.

35
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,299
MATT: Friday. And whose is that one?

36
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:21,849
MARISHA: Who goes up next?

37
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,191
LAURA: What? Who goes up what next?

38
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,199
MATT: The next Dear Abby?

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,258
LAURA: Oh, I think it's me!

40
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:32,365
MATT: Oh! Then we'll have Vex tomorrow coming up.
See her answering questions to various distraught

41
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:37,188
people throughout the realms of Exandria, and her
I'm sure very astute--

42
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:41,005
LAURA: I'm a really good giver of advice. I
learned that about myself.

43
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,178
ASHLEY: It's true.

44
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,353
LIAM: More about quantity than quality? Maybe?

45
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:52,211
MATT: Possibly. This is very true. So look for
that tomorrow on geekandsundry.com, that'll be fun

46
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:59,589
and exciting. Also, for those who didn't catch it
yesterday, we had an awesome event at Meltdown

47
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:05,210
Comics with the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons crew
announcing: one, their new storyline, which is the

48
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:14,653
Storm King's Thunder, I think is what it's called.
Really awesome, bringing the giants back into the

49
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:20,090
world with a very fleshed-out story. I'm super
excited about it, and keep tabs on that whenever

50
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,239
that comes out, should be in the next few months,
I think. I've seen some stuff behind-the-scenes

51
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
and it looks really, really cool. But as part of
that event yesterday, we also kicked off and

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,687
announced a new video series campaign that I'm
doing with the actual Wizards of the Coast

53
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:38,318
Dungeons &amp; Dragons team. Me and Chris Perkins
wrote and designed together a story that I fleshed

54
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,811
out and am running for a series of celebrity
guests, one of which is our fantastic Ashley

55
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:46,048
Johnson there.

56
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,954
ASHLEY: Hey!

57
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:50,331
LAURA and MARISHA: You're a celebrity!

58
00:03:50,331 --> 00:04:00,777
MATT: That was pretty great, guys. I'm not going
to lie, that was pretty legit.

59
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,105
LIAM: Just keep vamping. Keep vamping until the
bard gets here.

60
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:09,651
MATT: That's right, we're waiting on Scanlan to
get here. Other guests include Utkarsh, Shelby,

61
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:15,239
Jonah-- I wrote all the first names down because
the last names, some of them were hard to pronounce, but

62
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,680
you can look up the actual announcements to get
the full names. I'm really bad at this. It's been

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,008
two weeks, give me a break.

64
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:21,254
LIAM: You're busy. You're busy.

65
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:28,966
MATT: Nah! I've got so much free time. But it's
going to be a great group, and I look forward to

66
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,063
announcing it soon on when those will begin to air
throughout the summer, because it's going to be a

67
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:36,166
lot of fun. And I get to play in Forgotten Realms,
which is something I've wanted to do again for a

68
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:41,028
long time, and hope I don't mess up all the
existing fantastic lore that Ed Greenwood has

69
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:44,115
developed since he-- oh, are you okay, Laura?

70
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,332
LAURA: No, I really feel like I'm going to throw
up.

71
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:48,928
TRAVIS: There's literally up-chuck going to
happen. Just do it in a little thing and I'll feed

72
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:50,643
it back to you like a little bird

73
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,126
LIAM: Just go in there.

74
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,297
LAURA: (retching noise) I threw up so many dice!

75
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:57,839
TRAVIS: I'll talk about our sponsor this week.

76
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,012
MATT: You want to jump into that? Yeah, so we have
a new sponsor coming in, sponsoring this episode

77
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,670
of Critical Role this evening.

78
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,674
(cheering)

79
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,776
MATT: So Travis, you want to take it away?

80
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:13,371
TRAVIS: Our amazing sponsor this week is
Backblaze. Backblaze is an amazing, unlimited

81
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:19,583
cloud backup company for your Mac and PC, for just
five dollars a month, it's incredible. We have an

82
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:25,678
amazing representative from Backblaze in the
studio. He's a crazy, crazy uber-fan. Yev, wave

83
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:28,413
to me baby, blow me a kiss. He's incredible.

84
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,506
LAURA: You should check out his Twitter page
because he has printed out Flat Mercer and he's

85
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,475
chronicling his adventures, and I'm pretty proud
of it.

86
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:38,641
TRAVIS: Yes! We're on you, we're talking about
Backblaze right now.

87
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:41,598
SAM: Hey guys. Backblaze is a great service.

88
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:44,514
(laughter)

89
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:50,805
SAM: It offers unlimited cloud backup for Macs and
PCs for just five dollars a month. They're

90
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:55,676
supporting the show tonight. I was saying this in
the car on the way over.

91
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:57,495
(laughter)

92
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,198
MATT: Well, please continue, we're not stopping
you.

93
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:04,084
SAM: Guys, no shit, I just installed it yesterday
on my home computer. It's currently backing up

94
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:10,899
right now. It's an online file backup system for
all your stuff. Your documents, your media, your

95
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:18,898
Critical Role fanart, your videos of Scanlan
singing things. There's no gimmicks or additional

96
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:23,024
charges, it's just five dollars a month, and! You
don't want to go to Backblaze.com, you want to go

97
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:32,906
to backblaze.com/criticalrole, where you can get a
fully-featured 15-day trial.

98
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,966
TRAVIS: How many days, Sam?

99
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:39,819
SAM: 15 days, free! If you like it, keep getting
it, pay five bucks a month, that's nothing. Or if

100
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,504
you don't, whatever, it doesn't bother me. But
it's only for Critters, and also if you go to

101
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:49,100
backblaze.com/criticalrole right now, you'll see
pictures of us, quotes from us. It's actually

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,065
really cute.

103
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,480
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was pretty cute.

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,875
SAM: And I am such a supporter of these guys that
I even wrote a song for them.

105
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,510
MARISHA: What?

106
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,062
SAM: It's very short. Okay.

107
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,646
MATT: Please, go ahead.

108
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:12,806
SAM: (singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of
glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm

109
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:14,562
backing up-- okay, that's it.

110
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:17,406
(cheering)

111
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,202
SAM: I need a drink now.

112
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,668
MATT: You did good Sam, you did good.

113
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,709
LAURA: There's some Guinness in the fridge.

114
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:32,901
MATT: It's been cool having sponsors come to the
show, partially because they all come to us from

115
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:37,193
being fans of the actual show, and that's the
driving force behind this, so we want to make

116
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:41,244
sure that things are on-brand from people who are
genuinely interested in our community and have

117
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:45,241
things to offer that'll be useful. I can say this
as I have a web series I directed many years ago

118
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:49,400
and spent a whole year doing, I lost all the files
because of the hard drive that I had-- the

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,613
external hard drive failed, and I don't have any
of those anymore. And so since then I've been

120
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:58,152
very, very careful about backing everything up. So
this service would have been really helpful back

121
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:08,219
then. So don't make the same mistakes I did. There
Will Be Brawl only lives as final video files. It

122
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,694
kills me. I couldn't even fix stuff. Still have
the watermark on the last three videos for the

123
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:20,690
Escapist that I can't remove. Anyway. Learn from
my mistakes. So! Do we have anything else any of

124
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,287
you folks want to announce?

125
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,111
LAURA: E3's next week!

126
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,507
MATT: E3 is next week.

127
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:26,954
LAURA: Oh wait, no it's not. It's two weeks from
now.

128
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:27,973
MATT: No, it's two weeks from now.

129
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,777
LAURA: It's two weeks from now. I'm sorry.

130
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,881
MATT: I believe nothing coming out of that mouth
now!

131
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:39,252
TALIESIN: E3 is two weeks from now, and I'm also
going to be at Amazing Comic Con Vegas two weeks

132
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:46,473
from now. And Signal Boost is currently in its
second week, which is hilarious, and amazing, and

133
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:48,966
you should totally check it out because it's
weird.

134
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,434
MARISHA: Yeah. You're like the most interesting
man in the world.

135
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,454
TALIESIN: Thank you.

136
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:53,340
MARISHA: It's fantastic.

137
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,511
LAURA: I've always thought that about you,
Taliesin.

138
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:59,221
TALIESIN: Oh. Thanks. I'm now... yeah. I'm going
to die today, thank you.

139
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,464
(laughter)

140
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:01,839
LAURA: No you're not!

141
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,785
TRAVIS: Pike's got us covered. Right, Pike?

142
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:12,926
MATT: All right, great. So, without further ado,
and no further delaying the inevitable--

143
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:16,758
TRAVIS: You got a little something on your--

144
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,512
MATT: Little thing on my nose, right there?

145
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:19,899
TRAVIS: You might need to go the bathroom, check
it out.

146
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,187
MATT: No, it's great. So let's go ahead and roll
the intro and start playing Critical Role.

147
00:09:23,187 --> 00:10:54,546
[dramatic music]

148
00:10:54,546 --> 00:11:00,658
MATT: So. Continuing where we left off two weeks
ago. The intrepid party of adventurers known as

149
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:06,912
Vox Machina, after recently freeing the town of
Westruun from being occupied and ruled by the

150
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:14,738
roving Herd of the Storm, which Grog once hailed
from, cut down their brutal leader Kevdak and

151
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:21,582
temporarily restored power to a combination of
himself and Kevdak's son, Zanror. An accord was

152
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:29,457
made between the two of you to agree to go after
and destroy the ancient black dragon Umbrasyl, a

153
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:34,259
member of the Chroma Conclave, and marked for you
to eventually destroy anyway, but who had

154
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:41,534
currently made a deal with the Herd in exchange
for goods, gold, and ruling over the town, would

155
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:47,905
let them live and be essentially undisturbed,
seemingly. You gathered an army, you forged a

156
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:54,525
plan, and an ambush was set for the next time the
dragon swooped down from atop the mountain

157
00:11:54,525 --> 00:12:03,925
Gatshadow to retrieve its package. At this time,
the trap was sprung, the dragon held fast by hooks

158
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:11,196
and chains, a giant metallic trap designed and
orchestrated by Percival, and everything was going

159
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:17,159
great. The dragon had sustained quite a bit of
damage and seemed to be in a rough place until it

160
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:26,428
broke free and left much of the Herd fallen,
dissolving and screaming. Also, Scanlan and Vax

161
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:31,727
Dimension Door'd into the inside of the dragon and
have spent a number of rounds now deciding how to

162
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,302
get out of it maybe?

163
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,527
SAM: Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax.

164
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:45,899
MATT: Tiny Vax. Thanks to a potion that does that.
You managed to go ahead and put in an Immovable

165
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,759
Rod within its stomach, which held it up for a
moment before it decided to truly gain the

166
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,160
advantage it needed to escape the circumstance,
allowed it to tear through its body, as well as an

167
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,818
arrow that was shot by Vex towards her brother, in
hopes of-- I don't know, being a signal of hope or

168
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:05,133
to put him out of his misery? I'm still trying to
figure it out. At this point in time, Umbrasyl

169
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:12,489
took to the sky and began to coast off towards
Gatshadow, seemingly the domain that it's carved

170
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:20,955
for itself in this region. On its way out, Grog
had thrown his newly acquired Bloodaxe and his

171
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:27,215
Chain of Returning into the dragon, left it, and
is now being dragged behind it now, dangling as it

172
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:34,123
flies off. And that, my friends, is where we kick
back into the story.

173
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:36,469
TRAVIS: That's when they knew they fucked up.

174
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:39,468
(laughter)

175
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:50,741
MATT: So we have, as you guys-- Grog, your feet
leave the ground as you swing forward, unable by

176
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:56,148
the momentum pushing forward to keep up with the
sheer speed of this dragon and its size, its mass,

177
00:13:56,148 --> 00:14:02,456
its full stretched wings, it is far faster than
any of you expected and it whooshes off towards

178
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:07,383
the mountaintop. You, just looking behind as the
ground just fades further and further away. The

179
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:13,761
rest of you, Vox Machina, seeing this happen, see
essentially half of your friends, your party, only

180
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:21,746
one of them visible, now beyond your reach. With
that being said, for this circumstance, let's pick

181
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:24,311
up where we were on the initiative order between
you three.

182
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:28,006
LAURA: Just straight into it!

183
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,204
MATT: Yeah.

184
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,232
TRAVIS: I'm ready.

185
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,518
MATT: We left at the right time for that, guys.

186
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,432
LIAM: I cannot feel the lower half of my body.

187
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:36,167
(laughter)

188
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,887
MATT: Here, how about this? Because I can't find
the original initiative order, we'll just say for

189
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:42,939
this circumstance we'll roll initiative based on
what action's going to happen here. So we're going

190
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:44,738
to have you three roll initiative.

191
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:48,685
TRAVIS: Come on, lucky dice. I get advantage on
that.

192
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,925
SAM: I got 12.

193
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:52,747
LIAM: 13.

194
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:53,933
TRAVIS: 13 also.

195
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,068
LAURA: Oh jeez.

196
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,372
SAM: Starting off right.

197
00:14:56,372 --> 00:15:08,881
MATT: All right. So. As it crests into the sky
(whoosh), blackish dragon blood dripping from

198
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:15,777
wounds, you can feel every single tension of its
upper torso muscles with each swoop of the wings

199
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:22,147
crushing against you in this rhythmic pattern.
What little bit of air currently has been placed

200
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:27,654
at the top of the stomach, based on your
Thunderwave, is all you have to maintain any

201
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:35,950
semblance of hope. You, there's an arrow in
darkness. However, Umbrasyl at this point, who

202
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:45,841
does go first in this order, is just concentrating
on survival and continues gliding upward. You hear

203
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:52,648
a rumble within the inside of the body, and the
essence of a growling, angry voice creeps through.

204
00:15:52,648 --> 00:16:04,922
"These foul creatures. Get out of me!" (straining
sound) I need you guys to both roll strength

205
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,502
saving throws right now.

206
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:08,704
LAURA: He's trying to puke you up?

207
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:11,467
SAM: Or just crush us.

208
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:17,575
LIAM: Strength saving? Nine.

209
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,606
SAM: Yeah, not great. 15.

210
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:25,967
MATT: 15. You manage to put your arms against the
side, and using whatever forceful arcane cantrips

211
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:30,141
to keep the walls at bay before it actually finds
you, and you slip out in time. You, however, do

212
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:37,662
suffer six points of bludgeoning damage as the
muscles once again tense against you. Umbrasyl is

213
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:43,842
very much aware that there are now living things
inside the stomach squirming around and as the

214
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:53,945
muscles relax, the voice just growls again, "Try
all you want. Don't worry. I can eat you now or later."

215
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,102
LIAM: Can't hear you.

216
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,940
MATT: So. We had two 13s and a--

217
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,291
SAM: 12.

218
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,605
MATT: 12. All right. So Grog, Vax, what are you
guys doing?

219
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,425
LIAM: I'm taking--

220
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,154
MATT: The Bramblewood is now beneath you, you're
heading towards the mountain, you can see the edge

221
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,477
of the forest now.

222
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,438
TRAVIS: Maybe I go first, just in case
something--

223
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,371
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

224
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:21,862
TRAVIS: The Bramblewood? I'm holding on, right?
With the Titanstone Knuckles. Whereabouts is the

225
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:25,043
axe lodged? Can I see where the chain is attached
to?

226
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:29,498
MATT: You can see it curving up ahead of you and
with how high the sun is in the sky, it's around

227
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,415
noon, there's a heavy bit of shadow, and at this
distance? Make a perception check.

228
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:40,700
TRAVIS: (laughs) That went one and then a 13.
Minus-- zero. 13.

229
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:47,683
MATT: 13. It seems to be somewhere around the base
of the tail, like where the tail meets the rest of

230
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,679
the actual body itself, the torso area.

231
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,845
LAURA: It's in his butt.

232
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:53,995
MATT: No, it's not quite in his butt, it's more in
his side.

233
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:55,578
TRAVIS: How high am I?

234
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:59,107
MATT: Looking down? Numbers are hard for you to
pick up. It's a long way.

235
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:00,231
TRAVIS: A long way.

236
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,894
MATT: It's a long way. Like-- yeah.

237
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:06,686
TRAVIS: Well. Only one way to go. And that's up. I
would like to try and pull myself up the chain

238
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,270
towards Umbrasyl.

239
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,102
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics
check.

240
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,591
TRAVIS: Athletics or strength?

241
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,047
MATT: Athletics. Which is better, technically.

242
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:20,131
LAURA: It's a strength saving thing, so--

243
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,031
MATT: Yeah, it's strength plus your proficiency
bonus.

244
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,408
TRAVIS: Oh! I get an advantage or?

245
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:28,561
MATT: You get your proficiency bonus. You're no
longer raging, because this is more fear-struck at

246
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,486
this point.

247
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:30,966
TRAVIS: Oh, 14 plus five-- 19.

248
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:35,529
MATT: 19, yeah. You begin to ascend the chain. You
get closer to it, and you can now see the axe

249
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:41,194
itself is embedded and is starting to wiggle and
pull out. So you're making your way up the chain

250
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:45,729
with the full round at this point, you're almost
to it, but that's going to be the rest of your

251
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:46,830
action this turn.

252
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,022
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay!

253
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,001
MATT: So what are you doing?

254
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:54,671
LIAM: I'm taking the dragon sword and I am shoving
it along the angle of the arrow that's coming in

255
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:56,745
toward it, to try to go parallel.

256
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:00,865
MATT: Okay. The arrowhead is still poking
through--

257
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,044
LIAM: Through, and I'm sending it along that
line.

258
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:12,936
MATT: Okay, okay. All right. Go ahead and make a
general dexterity check. To see if you're able to--

259
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:14,937
LIAM: Natural 20.

260
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,835
(cheering)

261
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:23,951
MATT: Okay. Using the essence of where the actual
shaft of the arrow has pierced the hide and is

262
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:29,514
stuck through, you take the blade and use your
understanding of precision weapons and implements

263
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:35,914
to find the slight opening. And the blade
thankfully is very thin. Slide it through with

264
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:39,838
minimal resistance. You can see the muscles are
still pushing against it, but the already preset

265
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:43,952
wound from the arrow does guide it through, and
you manage to go straight to the hilt, and it's

266
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:48,878
found its way all the way through the wound. No
additional damage is dealt necessarily, but it has gone--

267
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,154
LIAM: This does not count as an attack on the
creature?

268
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:54,440
MATT: You said you wanted to put it through an
existing hole.

269
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,254
LIAM: The hole is this thick.

270
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:58,425
MATT: Yeah.

271
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:03,240
LIAM: Like a straw, and the blade is this, that's
not piercing damage? There's no piercing damage.

272
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,937
Whatever you want.

273
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,902
MATT: Do you want to roll an attack for this?

274
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:08,856
LIAM: Yes, I want it to be an attack.

275
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:12,532
MATT: Right, now you would make the attack as the
blade. The idea being that you wanted to guide it

276
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:13,900
through the hole.

277
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,247
LIAM: I'm going to use one of my Lucks. I've got
two left. Better.

278
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:19,912
MATT: Didn't you use any Luck for the battle?

279
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:21,603
LIAM: I used one last time.

280
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,262
MATT: Right, so you have two left.

281
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:31,895
LIAM: 12 plus strength, which is low, is 14. The
dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything,

282
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,526
guys? I don't know that I have the--

283
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:34,637
MATT: Plus one.

284
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,848
LIAM: Plus one. All right.

285
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,504
MATT: Yeah, and then it does additional damage
against dragons.

286
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:44,114
LIAM: Oh, and I have to roll-- I'll just say
I missed. For my bonus action, I'm going to slide

287
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:48,256
the dagger up along the same line and try to widen
that gap.

288
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:51,678
MATT: Okay. This roll will be at disadvantage.

289
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:55,617
LIAM: The last one was too, which is why I just
scrubbed it.

290
00:20:55,617 --> 00:21:01,115
MATT: Right, right, right. Go ahead and make the
secondary attack.

291
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:03,094
LIAM: No.

292
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:07,728
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so, the blade is in there and it
has found its way through the existing

293
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:11,604
wound, but you don't quite have the strength to
actually wrench it enough to do any real, serious

294
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:17,997
damage as it is a very, very hardy and
well-defended creature from its natural mass. The

295
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:23,612
fleshy interior of a dragon is almost as dense and
as protected as the armored hide on the outside,

296
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:26,959
and that's one thing you weren't counting on when
entering its form.

297
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:31,411
LIAM: And what did I just do, though, with the
dragon sword, did I widen the hole?

298
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:38,682
MATT: You've put the blade through the hole and so
now you have that blade lodged in, you can then

299
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:42,607
use that to try and widen it in successive turns
in itself and that will prevent you from having

300
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:46,610
disadvantage on the attacks with that blade going
forward, because it's already in a soft place and

301
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,529
you can just wedge it, but it's going to be a
strength attack for each of those rounds. The

302
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:56,490
dagger unfortunately, you just can't find any
purchase at that point there in the time given,

303
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,122
because of the movement and the squishing. You do
also suffer an additional seven points of crushing

304
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,303
damage.

305
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:06,429
LIAM: Okay, and I forgot. One other thing I want
to do-- I have movement too, can I use my legs to

306
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:14,654
push as hard as I can forward a foot or something?
I know with movement over difficult terrain it's

307
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:17,864
halved, and I'm in the most difficult terrain.

308
00:22:17,864 --> 00:22:21,180
MATT: You are in the most difficult terrain there
probably is.

309
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,107
LIAM: But if I use my movement could I shove and
go like a foot towards the outside, half a foot or

310
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,261
anything?

311
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:28,971
MATT: Pushing towards the wound?

312
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:30,981
LIAM: Pushing in. Using my legs to go--

313
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:36,045
MATT: Okay. I would say that would be part of your
attack next round. Actual movement within, you

314
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:39,540
would be able to move a few feet but you'd have to
release the blade to do so. Any actual blade

315
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,396
pushing forward would be your next action, so
hold off for the next round. Scanlan, what you got?

316
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:50,662
SAM: Oi. So I'm in a beast. As we all know,
intestines are my favoured terrain--

317
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,715
(laughter)

318
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,282
TRAVIS: I remember him saying that years ago!

319
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:56,536
MATT: This is true!

320
00:22:56,536 --> 00:23:00,706
LAURA: Back when we first made these characters, I
remember you saying that.

321
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:08,398
SAM: So I held up that rod, clicked it, and then
it was pulled out of the body pretty close to

322
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:14,716
where I am right now. When it went, did I see air?
Did I see daylight, when it went out of there?

323
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:17,662
MATT: It was very small. It's the equivalent of a
bullet going through, because the rod when it

324
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:22,956
punched through it didn't-- it's a very thin,
elongated object, so it pierced through like a

325
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:24,729
metal rod at a very high speed.

326
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,588
LIAM: So the dragon got very lucky and it went
through like that, and not like that.

327
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:34,593
MATT: If it would have hit-- at whatever angle it
would be, even then, it's only that wide and it

328
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:39,422
would still puncture a tiny slit, and due to the
density of both the muscles of the creature and

329
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:43,831
its body, it took damage and there's a little bit
of blood coming from the wound, you imagine, but

330
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:46,029
it's not like it's going to leave an open,
cavernous hole.

331
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,035
SAM: It's a cut.

332
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,271
MATT: Yeah, it's a cut.

333
00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:49,398
SAM: Got it.

334
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,660
MATT: But you did see where it (tearing noise)
through.

335
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,430
SAM: And when it went out, I didn't see any
daylight or anything. Just disappeared.

336
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,662
MATT: You just saw it (tearing noise) through the
creature's stomach. You do see a little bit of

337
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:01,330
blood beginning to pour out of where the wound
was.

338
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,907
SAM: Okay. Oh boy.

339
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:06,429
TRAVIS: Do it, baby.

340
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:15,630
SAM: I don't know, I got nothing. All right, I'll
just try something and we'll see if it works and

341
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:23,646
then I'll try something else next time. I won't
die in one round, right? I'm going to Polymorph

342
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:30,123
into a Tri-- not-a-ceratops. Into a small,
poisonous snake.

343
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:32,571
MATT: Okay!

344
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,095
SAM: And I'm going to go straight into that
wound.

345
00:24:35,095 --> 00:24:39,095
MATT: Okay, well, before that happens you do take
four points of acid damage from the stomach before

346
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:44,069
you take the form, because that would be the top
of the round. So, at which point you turn into a

347
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:48,946
small poisonous snake, now floating amongst the
acids, and find your way along the surface. And

348
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,757
you're heading towards the wound?

349
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,320
SAM: I'm going into the wound.

350
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,526
MATT: Okay, all right--

351
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,420
SAM: With a swim speed of 30!

352
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,622
MATT: Right, you do.

353
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,637
(laughter)

354
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:02,368
MATT: Let me check.

355
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:08,967
SAM: But I don't know if it's swimming, it's more
squeezing.

356
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,086
MATT: Through the acid, it's swimming. Once you
get to the actual wound, this is more squeezing.

357
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:17,687
And that's going to be more of a strength-based
element. So that being the case here, a poisonous

358
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:23,332
snake, I'm going to need you to go ahead and roll
a strength check to push against the wound.

359
00:25:23,332 --> 00:25:25,210
SAM: Sure, man. This is a strong snake.

360
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,335
LAURA: Really?

361
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:27,463
SAM: Natural one.

362
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:30,003
(laughter)

363
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:37,721
MATT: Which, just as a heads up, is a minus four
to its strength, so that's technically a negative three.

364
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:46,623
SAM: (bink) Going well, guys!

365
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:52,874
MATT: Yeah. You just dive in headfirst and with
all your snaky might, you slither and slither and

366
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:56,387
slither, just getting nowhere. No headway. This is
bad.

367
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,861
(laughter)

368
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:00,287
LIAM: Why don't you bite it, dude?

369
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,211
SAM: Oh yeah! Sure, I'll take a bite.

370
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,299
LIAM: Poisonous bite.

371
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,861
MATT: Sure, go for it. Roll for an attack.

372
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:09,522
SAM: 14 plus-- I have no idea.

373
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:10,957
MATT: Plus five.

374
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:12,650
SAM: Hey! That's a 19. That doesn't hit.

375
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,513
MATT: A 19? The inside of the stomach is not as
well-armored as outer parts of the body. A 19

376
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:19,230
would hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

377
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,724
SAM: What do I roll?

378
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:25,509
MATT: This would be-- oh no, you don't roll. It
takes one piercing damage.

379
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:28,589
(laughter)

380
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,573
SAM: Guys, we knocked it down a point!

381
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:39,330
MATT: And it has to make a constitution saving
throw versus your poison. That's an eight plus 14,

382
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,051
at a DC of ten. So yeah, it doesn't take any
additional-- oh, it takes half damage. So go ahead

383
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:46,400
and roll 2d4.

384
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,352
SAM: Ooh! Seven.

385
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:52,412
MATT: It takes three points of poison damage.

386
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:54,497
(laughter)

387
00:26:54,497 --> 00:27:05,583
SAM: And it is considered grappled. Okay. Plan A,
cross it off the list.

388
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,896
(laughter)

389
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:18,750
MATT: All right. Top of the round. Okay, so,
Umbrasyl is still flying up, looking down at its

390
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,869
form, is glancing about...

391
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,238
TRAVIS: Don't see me! Don't see me!

392
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:29,060
LAURA: You're in its butt. How can it see you?

393
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:36,296
MATT: Grog. As you're holding onto the axe, you
see before you, just pass underneath the leg and

394
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:42,758
the front arms that are reaching down, this giant,
dark, looming projection comes down and looks

395
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:46,679
right towards you. The horned front of the dragon as
Umbrasyl stares right into your face and goes,

396
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:58,244
"There you are." (draws in breath, exhales) And
unleashes a torrent of acid towards you. I need

397
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:05,121
you to go ahead and make-- this is going to roll a
dexterity saving throw. You have disadvantage.

398
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,770
TRAVIS: I do?

399
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,892
MATT: Because you're currently holding onto the
chain, but I believe you have advantage on them

400
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,091
because you are a barbarian.

401
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,777
TRAVIS: I have Danger Sense. So just one roll?

402
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,423
MATT: Yeah. So just roll.

403
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:19,799
TRAVIS: That's not great. 11.

404
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,435
ASHLEY: Can I-- do I see them?

405
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:27,342
MATT: No! They are way over-- they're like a tiny
little dragon speck in the distance. We'll get to

406
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:30,758
you guys here in just a moment, but their
situation is a little more dire and immediate, so

407
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,823
I have to figure out what's going on with them
right now.

408
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:35,876
LAURA: What if we could've chased after them?
Right away?

409
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,897
MATT: You can if you want to. Did you want to go
after them?

410
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,093
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

411
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,896
LAURA: I would have chased after them,
immediately, when it took off.

412
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:52,456
MATT: Okay, we'll get to that in just a minute. As
it is-- the dragon's speed is it can fly 80 feet

413
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,878
per round.

414
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:55,861
LAURA: That's really fast, though.

415
00:28:55,861 --> 00:29:01,355
MATT: Yeah, and it's making double-dash
manoeuvring here, even at your fly speed on the broom--

416
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:06,287
LAURA: What do great eagles have? Giant eagles, I
think, have really fast speed too.

417
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:09,135
MATT: Let's check that real fast. Giant eagles--

418
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:10,474
MARISHA: 80.

419
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:14,718
MATT: 80 feet. So the eagles are able to keep up.
Do you want something that way?

420
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,961
LAURA: So, if the eagles were to pick up
somebody--

421
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:22,841
MATT: First off, Grog, you take 62 points of acid
damage.

422
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:24,721
TRAVIS: Nice.

423
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,575
LAURA: Wait, you have acid resis-- no, you don't,
because Keyleth-- it went away.

424
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:30,132
TRAVIS: It went away?

425
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,758
LAURA: Yeah, remember? Because she used--

426
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:34,779
MATT: She took damage and it dropped.

427
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:41,382
MARISHA: I took damage, I'm sorry. It wasn't my
fault. I lost concentration. Blame the dragon that

428
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:42,942
did 40 damage.

429
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:50,424
MATT: So, as the stream pours past you, you feel
your flesh burning, and elements of your skin are

430
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:54,475
actually sloughing off and plummeting beneath you
like a thick oatmeal.

431
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,081
LAURA: Gross!

432
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:00,875
MATT: You still maintain your grip on the axe
through sheer force of anger and willpower.

433
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:08,698
Umbrasyl slows down a little bit in not doing the
double-dash maneuver. That's going to end

434
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:12,490
Umbrasyl's turn. So you sent the eagles after--

435
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,947
LAURA: Well no, I wanted the eagles to pick up
Pike and Percy.

436
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:21,147
MATT: So the eagles swing by--

437
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:29,591
MARISHA: Wait, not yet. Stone! Stone!

438
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:32,795
TALIESIN: Throw her the teleport stone!

439
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:37,617
ASHLEY: Gatestone! I pull it out of my bag. Pass
it to her.

440
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,957
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop on an eagle.

441
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:43,220
LAURA: I literally am sending the eagles as this
is happening and I dash out of the tree on my

442
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,870
broom, and go for the Immovable Rod, just long
enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off

443
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,289
after the dragon.

444
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,590
MATT: Okay, so you retrieve the rod, grab it, and
head off in that direction. So we now have both of

445
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,580
you, on eagle-back, heading off, with you trailing
behind as you can't quite travel at the same speed

446
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,627
as the eagles.

447
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:01,427
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and clear my gun while
I'm up there, too.

448
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,283
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, what are you doing?

449
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:08,476
MARISHA: You've got a ride. Animal handling. I'm
going to drop and I'll start focusing on the Gatestone.

450
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:14,067
TALIESIN: So, situated, I'm just going to try and
clear the gun and see if it's an easy fix.

451
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,290
MATT: Go for it.

452
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,039
TALIESIN: Nope. Gun's broken.

453
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,231
LAURA: It's broken?

454
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:25,489
TALIESIN: Yeah, gun's broken. I've got another gun,
but big gun's broken.

455
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:31,707
MATT: Yeah, Bad News is out. All right. As you're
flying off you're having a hard time with the

456
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:35,737
bumpy ride, as this eagle also has been near death
due to being partially dissolved by the acidic

457
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:41,263
attack from the dragon before. It wasn't the acid,
it was something else that wrecked it.

458
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:45,401
LAURA: No, it was a bite or a claw.

459
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:49,340
MATT: Yeah, I think it was a bite or a claw,
because the acid would've destroyed it. So the

460
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,368
eagle's heavily wounded, and due to it shuddering
and trying to keep up it just causes you to end up

461
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:55,071
bending a portion of the actual weapon.

462
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,793
TALIESIN: Damn it. I put it away.

463
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:59,905
MATT: All right. So you guys are keeping up.
You're concentrating on the stone.

464
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,604
MARISHA: One minute, baby.

465
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:08,549
MATT: Bringing us back now. Grog, you're
recovering from this attack.

466
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:14,325
TRAVIS: I look down and I see my beautiful body
tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal. Not

467
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:18,138
even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind, it's
like the maple brown sugar that no one--

468
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:19,906
LAURA: That's my favorite kind of oatmeal.

469
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:25,538
TRAVIS: Nobody likes that; you're alone in this.
And it makes me so angry that I go into a rage?

470
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:30,192
MATT: Do recall, you do have one point of
exhaustion since your frenzied rage did wear off

471
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:31,038
beforehand.

472
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,045
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

473
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,250
MATT: So you go into a rage.

474
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,822
LAURA: Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that
good?

475
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:38,196
MATT: It doesn't help with that, no.

476
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:42,346
TRAVIS: All right. So I go in a rage, and I would
like to try and continue climbing up the remainder

477
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:44,245
of the distance to Umbrasyl.

478
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:48,687
MATT: Okay. Athletics check, with advantage.

479
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:53,871
TRAVIS: That was a one.

480
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,197
LAURA: Oh, that's way better!

481
00:32:56,197 --> 00:33:00,590
TRAVIS: That's much better. That's a 29.

482
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,714
MATT: You find your way up, grabbing onto the edge
of the tail, and you actually pull yourself up

483
00:33:05,714 --> 00:33:09,591
onto the base of the tail. You're on the back of
Umbrasyl right now. The chain is still currently

484
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,394
attached to its side.

485
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:12,720
MARISHA: Khaleesi!

486
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,278
TRAVIS: Mother of dragons! Do I have any more
movement?

487
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:26,598
MATT: It's taken your whole turn to really get up
there. Are you going to dislodge the Bloodaxe, or

488
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:27,779
leave it there?

489
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,028
TRAVIS: I'm going to dislodge it, because it was
already so weak.

490
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:33,971
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make your check to
remove it. It's a DC 12, I think.

491
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:40,878
TRAVIS: That's a one. Yep.

492
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:49,079
MATT: You pull on the chain, but the reason it
managed to hold your weight this whole ride up was

493
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:52,804
it was wedged pretty well into its armored hide.
And thank god it did. However, at this point, it's

494
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:57,315
proving that that is now coming back to haunt you,
as it is really hard to pull it from where it's

495
00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:01,915
stuck in the dragon. That's going to be the end of
your turn. Vax.

496
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:07,229
LIAM: First turn I'm going to use the dragon blade
to attack and slice downward and try to wedge that

497
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:09,464
hole open a little bigger.

498
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,994
MATT: Go for it.

499
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:19,798
LIAM: That hits. Well, I don't know if it hits.
Nine plus my strength for this sword, right, not

500
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:21,213
dexterity?

501
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:24,804
MATT: Correct. I'm letting this one be a finesse.

502
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:29,832
LIAM: I probably hit him before. So that's a 25.

503
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:43,699
MATT: 25? You carve an opening in the side about a
foot and a half in full length there. As you drag

504
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:48,254
it you hear a roaring. Go ahead and roll damage on
that.

505
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,339
TALIESIN: It's 1d8 plus your dex--

506
00:34:50,339 --> 00:35:01,986
LIAM: Yeah, I know, I got that written down, thank
you. 16.

507
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,388
MATT: 16? All righty.

508
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:10,081
LIAM: And then, this is a game rules thing. Grog's
within five feet of this thing and I'm no longer

509
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:12,800
at disadvantage. Or am I?

510
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,240
MATT: This is less rules and more narrative. You
don't understand the body or where you really are

511
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,017
in the body of the dragon. He's not threatening
the creature right now. If anything, it's

512
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:27,253
potentially threatening you. This would not be a
sneak attack.

513
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:29,087
LIAM: I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's
possible.

514
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,128
MATT: No worries.

515
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:38,323
LIAM: I'll use the dagger to hit. Am I at
disadvantage with the dagger still?

516
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:44,702
MATT: I'd say yes, because the only reason you
didn't have disadvantage with the other blade is

517
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:47,033
because it was within an existing wound and then
you pulled back.

518
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,321
LIAM: Then I miss.

519
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:50,675
MATT: Okay, the other dagger, you go ahead and
stab again, this time it hits a dense part of

520
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:54,159
muscle and does sink in, but not enough to do any
serious damage from the inside.

521
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,386
LIAM: And there's air queefing in and out of this
slot?

522
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:58,628
(laughter)

523
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:10,838
MATT: A little bit, yes. It's about that wide. You
staying there?

524
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:27,897
LIAM: Yes. No. I'm going to slide my body and try
to stick head and dagger arm out of it and hang

525
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,206
half in and half out, if possible.

526
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:34,434
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and make a straight strength
check.

527
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,894
LIAM: 13.

528
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,953
MATT: 13? That's fine. Thankfully, the DC's lower
because you managed to carve the large wound in.

529
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:44,290
You plant your feet against the other muscle wall
that you are between and you push off and get

530
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:53,004
yourself through. And in the most awkward, tiny
birth, just above your armpits, your head and arm

531
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:57,694
emerge out the side. Immediately a gust of wind
hits your hand as you realize and look down: you

532
00:36:57,694 --> 00:37:05,775
are hundreds of feet above the ground. Bramblewood
right beneath you. But you are partially out of

533
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,640
the dragon.

534
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,006
LAURA: You can breathe!

535
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,230
LIAM: (gasps for air)

536
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:18,044
MATT: Take a deep breath. You take three points of
crushing damage as the muscle walls around you are

537
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:23,847
still squeezing in on you in your current
placement. That ends your turn. You! At the top of

538
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:29,183
your round, your snake takes acid damage. Only one
point of acid damage. How many hit points does

539
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:30,438
your poisonous snake have?

540
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:31,694
SAM: I don't think he has very many.

541
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:35,689
MATT: It may have less than one hit point, in
which case, you're just going to turn right back

542
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:36,936
into Scanlan.

543
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,355
SAM: I think he's dead.

544
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:42,443
MATT: Let's find out. It has two hit points!

545
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:46,780
SAM: Oh god! Oh no, but wait, I took damage last
round, too.

546
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,791
MATT: That was before you transformed. It was 
at the top of your round.

547
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,787
SAM: Hey, I'm still a snake!

548
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:53,836
(laughter)

549
00:37:53,836 --> 00:38:01,954
SAM: Well, I'm not going to try that any more. If
I drop form, is that my whole round?

550
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:04,030
MATT: No, you just let it go.

551
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,591
SAM: I'm going to drop the snake. Snake was a try
and fail.

552
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:12,979
MATT: It was a good idea. Just not a very strong
snake.

553
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:20,810
SAM: I drop the snake, try to get that little
bubble of air (gasps), and I'll fucking cast

554
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,976
Bigby's Hand.

555
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:29,036
MATT: Okay! So, using that little pocket of air,
you bring your hand up, you do your quick somatic

556
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:34,910
components, shouting the phrase, and Bigby's Hand
appears and is currently being squished between

557
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,874
some of the walls of the stomach.

558
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,324
SAM: Can he move at all?

559
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:39,459
MATT: Yeah!

560
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:53,580
SAM: Okay. I would like to fist the wound. Jam it,
find a finger and-- how you like that?

561
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,951
TALIESIN: You're fingering the wound. Okay!

562
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:59,061
(laughter)

563
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:06,333
SAM: This wound will never heal.

564
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:11,387
MATT: I don't-- yeah.

565
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:16,245
(laughter)

566
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:20,179
SAM: So would it be a forceful hand?

567
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:24,990
MATT: This would be a very forceful hand. This
would be the definition of Bigby's Forceful Hand.

568
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:33,896
Go ahead and roll an athletics check for Bigby,
which is strength 28, so add plus eight to the roll.

569
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,391
SAM: 12?!

570
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,590
MATT: Total of 12?

571
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,565
SAM: Yes!

572
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:44,556
MATT: The finger pushes partway in and gets about
halfway up to its second knuckle.

573
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:47,507
(laughter)

574
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:49,819
MATT: It is just chilling right there.

575
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:55,990
SAM: This is so embarrassing! Wow!

576
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,718
(laughter)

577
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:01,138
MATT: I'm blushing, man!

578
00:40:01,138 --> 00:40:03,046
LIAM: All about phrasing.

579
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:05,258
SAM: Wow! Okay!

580
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:06,873
MATT: All right, that's your turn.

581
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:09,211
SAM: I have movement, right?

582
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,265
MATT: You do have movement, yes.

583
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:19,795
SAM: I can't move anywhere! I have climbing stuff
with me. Can I move my arms at all?

584
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,693
MATT: You can move your arms, yeah.

585
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:27,093
SAM: I would like to take out a grappling hook and
grab onto the inside lining of the stomach.

586
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:29,546
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.

587
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:32,149
SAM: Nope! Six!

588
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:39,082
MATT: Six. You take it and (ting, swish). It just
slips along the very heavy mucous material lined

589
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:42,242
interior of the stomach. There's a little scrape
line, but that's about it.

590
00:40:42,242 --> 00:40:44,687
SAM: I can't do anything! It's great.

591
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:53,117
MATT: Top of Umbrasyl's round. Breath weapon does
not return. However, is going to use one of its

592
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:58,423
legendary actions and attempt to beat its wings to
shake you off of it, Grog.

593
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:01,198
LAURA: Are you raging?

594
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:02,593
TRAVIS: Yeah.

595
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,021
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity
saving throw.

596
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:14,640
TRAVIS: Which I have advantage on. 18.

597
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,896
MATT: 18. You take 15 points of bludgeoning
damage, which is reduced by half, so you're only

598
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,817
taking seven. However, you are knocked prone.

599
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,172
TRAVIS: (laughing) On his back.

600
00:41:28,172 --> 00:41:32,443
MATT: Yes, which causes you to begin tumbling off
the back of the tail. The wind of it-- (thump thump)

601
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,034
TRAVIS: Shit!

602
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:39,647
MATT: The chain of returning is still attached to
you, however, and as you go tumbling off the back

603
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:48,875
of the tail, it catches you, and you are now
swinging towards the back of the creature, of the

604
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:55,589
dragon now, back where you started. Only the
dragon is very aware of your presence. But you

605
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:56,815
didn't plummet to your death!

606
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,248
TRAVIS: That's good!

607
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,538
MATT: That was the end of your turn. Now it's the
top of Umbrasyl's turn.

608
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:02,989
SAM: These dragons are hard to kill!

609
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:09,747
MATT: Yeah, imagine that! At this point, now, as this
has gone on for a little while as you guys began

610
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:15,693
to ascend and it went upward, it's now partway up
the mountainside. You can see the forest has

611
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:19,072
gotten more sparse. There are trees scattered
across the top of the mountaintop.

612
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:21,788
LIAM: We're close to Gatshadow already?

613
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:27,770
MATT: You can see it. You're not there, but it's
going across the forest top and it's coming

614
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:32,084
towards the actual mountain base. It hasn't quite
ascended it completely.

615
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:35,851
LAURA: What about giant eagles with people on
them?

616
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:41,391
MATT: They're keeping in tandem with it. They're
not able to quite catch up entirely, just due to

617
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,821
the nature of the fast dragon.

618
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:45,177
LIAM: Arrow range?

619
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:49,390
MATT: Not for her, unfortunately, no.

620
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,810
TALIESIN: We're not within 400 feet of it, are
we?

621
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,647
MATT: You, at this point, jumping on, would just
be on the outside of the range if you wanted to

622
00:42:59,647 --> 00:43:08,691
try. You're at disadvantage on these attacks
because you are on the back of a flying, wounded bird.

623
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:12,397
LAURA: Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl!

624
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:25,520
TALIESIN: Fuck it. Taking a shot. At least taking
one shot to see what happens. Ooh yeah.

625
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,514
Natural 20.

626
00:43:27,514 --> 00:43:29,982
MATT: With disadvantage.

627
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,823
TRAVIS: Do it again.

628
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:39,368
TALIESIN: 18, that'll do. 27 to hit.

629
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:41,777
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

630
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:49,374
TALIESIN: Oh, and he still has-- no, I lost Hex.

631
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:50,875
MATT: You lost Hex, yeah.

632
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:55,755
LIAM: You're doing great, de Rolo, come on! Keep
your head in the game.

633
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:59,538
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage.

634
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:11,997
MATT: Gun goes off. You hear a whizz go by your
ear as the bullet hits the side of Umbrasyl.

635
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:18,073
(grunting) The head looks back towards the rest of
you, now approaching at a distance.

636
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,180
LAURA: Do not let the bird get hit! You will
plummet to your fucking death.

637
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:33,207
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend the rest of my 
attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level.

638
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:39,727
MATT: So, at the top of Umbrasyl's turn, as you
guys are pushing forward and you're still

639
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:51,376
concentrating, the dragon growls under its breath.
(spellcasting) You can't hear it. You're too far away.

640
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:53,381
ASHLEY: She can read lips!

641
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:58,389
LAURA: I'm so far away! I just want to know what
he's saying.

642
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:04,439
MATT: The outer view of the dragon shimmers for a
second and then vanishes from sight.

643
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,937
LIAM: Are we visible?

644
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,145
MATT: No.

645
00:45:08,145 --> 00:45:11,105
LIAM: We're not like Wonder Woman inside the jet?
What about my hand hanging out?

646
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,261
MATT: Yeah. You see the dragon.

647
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:15,257
SAM: What about Grog?

648
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:20,493
MATT: Grog is dangling from nothing right now.
Grog is kiting through the air.

649
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:25,112
TALIESIN: You have Hunter's Mark.

650
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:27,704
ASHLEY: So we can see Grog?

651
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:29,938
MATT: In theory, yeah, if you can keep a bead on
him.

652
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,435
TRAVIS: I'm enlarged.

653
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,595
MATT: A very heavy Grog.

654
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,700
LAURA: Is he Hunter's Marked still--

655
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,641
MATT: He would be. You haven't taken a lot of
damage yet, or at all.

656
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:41,145
LAURA: I haven't taken any damage.

657
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:48,695
MATT: Then you still have Hunter's Mark on him,
yeah. Continues upward. That comes to the next

658
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:50,581
part. Grog, you're up.

659
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:55,289
TRAVIS: I had one question. I drank that Potion
of Speed. It hastes me for a minute. How many

660
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,939
rounds is a minute?

661
00:45:56,939 --> 00:45:59,321
MATT: That has gone away, unfortunately.

662
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:04,005
TRAVIS: Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back
up the chain!

663
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:05,615
MATT: Make an athletics check.

664
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:13,972
TRAVIS: Up the chain! Fucking weiner snap. 15.

665
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:20,209
MATT: 15? All righty. You manage to pull yourself
halfway up the chain. You get back to where you

666
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:24,330
were towards the base of the tail. That's the
extent of your round there. The wind resistance

667
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:28,108
itself, you can see the axe itself, after you
tried to tug it forward, did bring it a little

668
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:31,693
loose. So its position is still a little
precarious.

669
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:36,422
TRAVIS: Might as well say something cool. I can do
this all day! I'm really not confident.

670
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:39,096
MATT: All right. Vax.

671
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:44,670
LIAM: I would like to use my movement, if I can,
with the blade I used to go this way, and I cut a

672
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,191
big foot-long thing. I want to try to use my
movement to reverse the direction of the blade and

673
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:51,135
stab inward.

674
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,396
MATT: It would be part of the attack to draw it
out and attack. It wouldn't use your

675
00:46:57,396 --> 00:47:00,010
movement. It would be part of the attack to draw
it out and attack with it. It wouldn't use your

676
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,008
movement.

677
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:03,061
LIAM: My dagger hand's the one that's out. I want
to try to maneuver the sword around and stab

678
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:09,509
inward and keep cutting bacon in here. I want to
attack the dragon, but still from the inside with

679
00:47:09,509 --> 00:47:11,573
the hand that's inside.

680
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:17,946
MATT: Okay. You're in a weird position now where
the blade's at your side, so pulling away from the

681
00:47:17,946 --> 00:47:24,026
body, there's very little strength to pull that way,
since you punched through the wound. So you're

682
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:25,755
essentially holding the blade right here.

683
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:28,890
LIAM: Then if I did this, can I just continue to
saw in the same direction and do an attack?

684
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,119
MATT: You'd be at a disadvantage on it.

685
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,965
LIAM: Visual. I don't know what I'm seeing.

686
00:47:33,965 --> 00:47:39,516
MAT:T You stabbed through, you cut a wound.
Holding that blade, you punched through, and the

687
00:47:39,516 --> 00:47:46,797
thickness is about most of your body's length. So
most of your body is still in the wound. You've

688
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:51,017
just barely pushed through, and you're still
holding the blade back this way. There's no real

689
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:54,972
strength to attack from this position because
you're being squished.

690
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,645
LIAM: Then I'm going to attack at disadvantage
with the dragon blade, and then I'm going to stab

691
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,474
with the dagger that's outside.

692
00:48:00,474 --> 00:48:02,235
MATT: Go for it.

693
00:48:02,235 --> 00:48:09,635
LIAM: Dragon blade on the inside rolled a 15.

694
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:10,980
MATT: 15?

695
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,138
LIAM: Yeah.

696
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:16,237
MATT: There's just not enough strength to get it
though. You try and pull upward and the blade

697
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:22,496
comes loose, comes towards your body, but doesn't
actually find any additional part of the muscle to

698
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:23,501
cut through.

699
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,559
LIAM: Dagger on the outside is 21.

700
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:33,396
MATT: 21? Just scrapes across the hide. Not strong
enough to pierce it from the outside. You do also

701
00:48:33,396 --> 00:48:40,351
take one point of bludgeoning damage as the wound
tenses around you once more. Scanlan!

702
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:49,233
SAM: For my bonus action, I'm going to fist the
dragon again! Just going to jam it in there!

703
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,532
MATT: Roll an athletics check with plus eight.

704
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,291
SAM: 20!

705
00:48:53,291 --> 00:49:00,473
MATT: 20! The hand pushes into the wound, causing
it to tear open and rupture part of the stomach.

706
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:08,649
As it punches through, temporarily leaving an open
wound in the side of its stomach area, Bigby's

707
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:11,663
Hand is partially outside the dragon now.

708
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:13,091
SAM: Great!

709
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:28,099
MATT: It takes 11 points of damage from the wound.
And you currently have a little bit of light

710
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,968
that's visible before the wound closes.

711
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,972
SAM: Before the wound closes.

712
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:38,420
MATT: The muscles re-tense. You watch it punch
through and everything (gasp). It's the moment of

713
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,670
impact.

714
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:47,017
SAM: I'm going to jump in the hole.

715
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:51,573
MATT: You leap in after Bigby's Hand just in the
wake of it slamming into the side of the muscle of

716
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:56,925
the stomach walls. In that one moment, you're
rushing past, you can feel the actual muscles

717
00:49:56,925 --> 00:50:00,551
tensing behind you. Go ahead and make a dexterity
saving throw.

718
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:07,202
SAM: Dexterity saving throw. 18!

719
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:14,226
MATT: 18! Okay! You manage to leap behind Bigby's
Hand and grab onto the side of it as the hand

720
00:50:14,226 --> 00:50:19,457
punches entirely out of the dragon's body, the
wound slamming shut behind.

721
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,039
SAM: Oh god, I'm outside the dragon?!

722
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:22,339
MATT: You are now outside the dragon.

723
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:24,305
SAM: (screams) Shit!

724
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:26,233
MATT: Holding onto Bigby's Hand.

725
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:29,473
SAM: Is he flying? Does he stay still? What does
he do?

726
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:31,029
MATT: He is flying.

727
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,162
SAM: He can fly?!

728
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:35,046
MATT: Bigby's Hand!

729
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:36,829
SAM: Not as fast as the dragon.

730
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:41,943
MATT: Bigby's Hand can move up to 60 feet, so no,
it's slower than the dragon. Starting to drag a

731
00:50:41,943 --> 00:50:44,182
little bit behind as it's moving.

732
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:48,248
SAM: God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else,
right?

733
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:52,526
MATT: No, that was its action. That's most of
your turn, really, at this point. That was your

734
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:56,847
movement to push through after the bonus attack,
so you have your action. I'll give you your action.

735
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,632
SAM: You're not going to let me cast another
spell, probably.

736
00:50:59,632 --> 00:51:04,649
MATT: You have an action, so you could,
technically. You look out as you punch through.

737
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:10,667
You look down below you suddenly after you take a
moment to look, and you can see part of Vax

738
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:15,846
emerging from the side of the dragon. And then the
whole dragon and Vax vanish.

739
00:51:15,846 --> 00:51:20,674
SAM: Oh shit! Wait, I see Grog?

740
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:25,604
MATT: You do see Grog, dangling from the chain,
slowly pulling his way up towards the back.

741
00:51:25,604 --> 00:51:27,297
TRAVIS: (screaming) Scanlan!

742
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:29,159
SAM: I'm holding onto the hand?

743
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,881
TRAVIS: (screaming) What the fuck?!

744
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:35,743
MATT: You are now right there with Bigby's Hand.

745
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:39,172
(laughter)

746
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:41,378
SAM: The Hand can't do anything else.

747
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:43,144
MATT: Not this turn, no.

748
00:51:43,144 --> 00:51:52,796
SAM: Shit. I just got out of the dragon. I don't
know what's going on. I didn't even know we were

749
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:56,879
flying. I'm just going to shoot a Lightning Bolt
at him.

750
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,411
MATT: Okay!

751
00:51:58,411 --> 00:51:59,636
SAM: Yeah.

752
00:51:59,636 --> 00:52:08,793
MATT: All right. Advantage on the dexterity saving
throw. What's the DC of it? The DC of the

753
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,050
Lightning Bolt?

754
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,994
SAM: It's my spell. It's not through the Hand
Cone, I assume.

755
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:13,997
MATT: Nope, you are clutching both hands onto the
side.

756
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:14,877
SAM: 18.

757
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:17,633
MATT: 18. It makes the save. Roll damage, and it
takes half damage.

758
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:33,387
SAM: 26.

759
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:41,442
MATT: 26. All right, so it takes 13 points of lightning
damage. (blast) The bolt streaks upward, hitting

760
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:45,458
the sides of the wound that you just came out of
it, and arcs up the side of the body. Most of it

761
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:50,190
is absorbed from the hefty, scaled hide of the
black dragon, but it does (unhappy groan) roil

762
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:58,251
with pain. You hear it yelling, and with a very
slight shifting of light, you notice the dragon is

763
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:06,884
still there, and you recognize this. This is an
Invisibility spell. That ends your turn.

764
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,380
SAM: I guess so.

765
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,274
MATT: So, the rest of you guys, trying to keep up.
The dragon's far out of range of anything you

766
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:17,314
have, and it's just seems to be coasting as fast
as it can out of the way, so you have nothing, I

767
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:25,108
don't think, that can really go past a 300, 400
foot range. So you're just keeping on that eagle,

768
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:31,827
holding on. You as well, you're behind the others,
just slowly falling behind.

769
00:53:31,827 --> 00:53:34,032
LAURA: How fast can my broom go?

770
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:41,663
MATT: I think it's 50 feet. I can look it up again
real fast. It's not a racing broom. Quidditch

771
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:45,485
broom. I'll find it for you.

772
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:48,489
LAURA: And my boots of haste don't do shit to a
broom.

773
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:51,872
MATT: I'm going to look it up right now, just to
let you know, so we can all relax.

774
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:59,055
TRAVIS: It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry
Potter.

775
00:53:59,055 --> 00:54:00,515
MATT: I gather that.

776
00:54:00,515 --> 00:54:02,214
(laughter)

777
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:12,115
MATT: I love it, too. Broom of Flying. Flying
speed is 50 feet. You can't even see it now.

778
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:17,585
Grog's just become this little speck in the
distance. All right, so as that's going on, are

779
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:18,846
you doing anything?

780
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:23,954
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what
I can see and try to keep up as best I can at

781
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:25,859
treeline, like below.

782
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:35,126
MATT: Back to the top of the round. The dragon,
Umbrasyl, now (wings flapping). Even you are being

783
00:54:35,126 --> 00:54:41,499
dragged behind nothing, you can hear the wings
beating. You still have full sight of the dragon

784
00:54:41,499 --> 00:54:52,114
at this point. The voice growls out of its throat,
"Fine. Let's see how well you hold on, insects!"

785
00:54:52,114 --> 00:55:00,723
It begins to spin and do a barrel roll. I need
both of you, as also its muscles tense, to roll

786
00:55:00,723 --> 00:55:02,439
strength saving throws.

787
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:08,816
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those.

788
00:55:08,816 --> 00:55:10,106
LIAM: Six.

789
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,136
MATT: Six?

790
00:55:11,136 --> 00:55:12,432
TRAVIS: 26.

791
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:15,766
MATT: 26. You get swung around, the chain taking
the brunt of all the weight across its back.

792
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:25,964
(popping) Comes free. Thankfully, you were in an
up arc, but you are now arcing in the air. You

793
00:55:25,964 --> 00:55:32,061
also get ejected from the wound from the muscles
tensing behind, it almost squeezes you out. Before

794
00:55:32,061 --> 00:55:37,425
you can even get a grapple on, the dragon vanishes
from sight and you're now falling backwards.

795
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:44,928
LIAM: I'd like take a chance to say, here, that
when I went into this dragon, I was lost, and a

796
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:52,990
wanderer. As I am shat out its side, I come forth
a paladin of the Raven Queen. I have multiclassed

797
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:58,181
and leveled up. And the last thing I'm thinking as
I shoot out this hole in its side is: if you have

798
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:02,548
any wings to lend me, now is the time.

799
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:12,858
MATT: Okay. As you emerge from the body of
Umbrasyl, there is a streak of shadow that

800
00:56:12,858 --> 00:56:20,262
scatters into a burst of darkened raven feathers
that fill the air around you. You still plummet,

801
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:26,394
but as a nature of your prayer, that brief moment
of understanding, it appears there is some

802
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:31,257
reaction. That'll be that element there.

803
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:34,081
MARISHA: Where am I in my minute?

804
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:42,921
MATT: Oh, you're like 20 seconds in. 30 seconds
in.

805
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:45,041
ASHLEY: Are they all falling?

806
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:54,878
MATT: You guys now watch as, suddenly, Grog and
Vax just (rush of air). Vax appears out of nowhere

807
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:59,512
and is falling. Scanlan's being held aloft by a
distant Bigby's Hand, and Grog is arcing in

808
00:56:59,512 --> 00:57:07,601
the air. At that point now, Grog, Vax, what are
you doing as you're falling backward?

809
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:12,917
TRAVIS: I take out a case of fancy wine and--

810
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:17,534
(laughter)

811
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:26,352
TRAVIS: I pull out a fancy robe, of which there
are two, and pull it out. I'm going to drop the

812
00:57:26,352 --> 00:57:32,876
Bloodaxe. I'm going to grab both ends of the fancy
robe and just make the shittiest parachute of all time.

813
00:57:32,876 --> 00:57:34,722
MATT: (air puffs)

814
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:36,690
TRAVIS: There ain't much else to do.

815
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,234
MARISHA: Shitty G.I. Joes.

816
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:47,587
MATT: Yeah, it's like 25 cent quality, above you,
Grog, as you squeeze your eyes and hold on.

817
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:52,694
Plummeting down towards the Bramblewood. Vax.

818
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:57,914
LIAM: Hey, I'm a brand new paladin. Lay on Hands,
which is going to do fuck all for me, but is that

819
00:57:57,914 --> 00:57:59,383
a bonus action?

820
00:57:59,383 --> 00:58:00,831
MATT: I believe it's an action.

821
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:08,963
LIAM: An action? Okay. I'm going to cast Lay on
Hands on myself. And I'm going throw my poison

822
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:22,803
dagger at the dragon as I fall. That's a 23.

823
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,429
MATT: 23 does hit.

824
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:37,360
LIAM: That is ten points of damage with poison on
it. It's a DC of 15 for poison. I'm sure it makes it.

825
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,900
MATT: Yeah, it makes it. It would've had to roll a
one to not make it, unfortunately.

826
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,120
TRAVIS: Could I add one bonus thing at the end of
mine?

827
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,290
MATT: Sure.

828
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:49,379
TRAVIS: Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all?
Or is the world just a clusterfuck?

829
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:53,542
MATT: Make a perception check, just glancing
around you.

830
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,236
TRAVIS: Four.

831
00:58:55,236 --> 00:59:01,189
MATT: Four. No. You see earth beneath you, sky
above, mountain to your left, and the inevitable

832
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:04,141
plummet coming at you.

833
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:07,992
LIAM: I'm thinking about my mother as I fall
backward through space.

834
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:11,485
SAM: Distance between me and them?

835
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:20,962
MATT: Vax is about 20 feet from you, Grog's about
60, 70 feet from you.

836
00:59:20,962 --> 00:59:25,070
SAM: What's the range of-- shit.

837
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,329
TALIESIN: 50 feet.

838
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,232
TRAVIS: Remember, we're going to be 
going the same direction.

839
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:34,934
MARISHA: They're both falling, yeah. Vax will hit
the ground first.

840
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:37,897
SAM: Vax will?

841
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,509
TRAVIS: I'm higher.

842
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,290
MATT: The dragon's moved ahead to this point now
since you guys have fallen off.

843
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,435
SAM: Is anyone higher than me?

844
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:47,502
MATT: Grog is. Vax is a little bit below you.

845
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:51,175
SAM: And he's not flying or anything, is he?

846
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:56,479
MATT: He's trying. He's holding a scrap piece of
fabric that's just (rustling fabric).

847
00:59:56,479 --> 01:00:01,839
TRAVIS: I've seen Percy make shit, I can do it,
too! (blows puffs of air)

848
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,117
TALIESIN: You're doing very well. You're doing
very well.

849
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:07,237
SAM: Wow. This didn't go well.

850
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:11,385
MARISHA: I'm hoping you can hold on for a minute.

851
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:24,167
SAM: Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60
feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to

852
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,715
them as they fall?

853
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:28,531
MATT: Right now, you could catch up to one of
them.

854
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:31,606
SAM: All right. Because Grog is over me, right?

855
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:34,267
MATT: Yeah, Grog is in an arc, so you would have
to meet him as he fell.

856
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:36,091
SAM: I'll try to catch him then.

857
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:39,586
MATT: Okay, so you clutch onto Bigby's Hand and
move as he plummets.

858
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:41,250
SAM: Shit, wait. Wait.

859
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,369
MATT: What are you doing? What are you doing,
Scanlan?

860
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:46,227
SAM: Shit. Vax is below me, though.

861
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:49,698
LIAM: He said you can get to one of them, so it's
just a Sophie's Choice.

862
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:51,674
SAM: It's a Sophie's Choice.

863
01:00:51,674 --> 01:00:54,140
MARISHA: But who's on the lowest hit points?

864
01:00:54,140 --> 01:01:00,111
SAM: Yeah, I would go for Grog if he's above me,
with the hand.

865
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:08,616
MATT: Okay. The hand comes forward, sends out this
cupping motion, the fingers below. You, eyes

866
01:01:08,616 --> 01:01:15,282
closed, clenching tight, (impact). All of a
sudden, the wind stops, and it's like you're being

867
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:20,295
held by your mother again, a memory you haven't
recalled since you were a child. You open your

868
01:01:20,295 --> 01:01:24,054
eyes slowly, and you're still above the ground!
Holy shit! But there's a giant purple hand around

869
01:01:24,054 --> 01:01:26,868
you and a very freaked out Scanlan clutching the
outside.

870
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:29,792
TRAVIS: Look what you did!

871
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:37,481
SAM: Hi, friend. Shit. We've got to go to Vax.
I'll start moving us slowly down, I guess.

872
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:39,859
MATT: That was the turn to even get to him and
catch him.

873
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,116
SAM: Then-- fuck.

874
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,054
MATT: You still have an action if you have
anything.

875
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:46,086
SAM: I can't see the dragon anymore, right?

876
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:48,453
MATT: No. You have a vague idea of where it might
be.

877
01:01:48,453 --> 01:01:50,107
MARISHA: Do you still have Polymorph?

878
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,095
SAM: Yeah, concentration.

879
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:53,390
MARISHA: Fuck.

880
01:01:53,390 --> 01:02:03,916
SAM: Yep. I mean, I can make Grog deaf so he won't
hear us die.

881
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:06,173
(laughter)

882
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:07,311
MATT: That's useful.

883
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:09,392
TALIESIN: That seems like a really good use.

884
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:31,433
SAM: I got Grog. Fuck. Okay. I'm going to drop
Bigby's Hand and Polymorph Grog into an eagle.

885
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:40,949
MATT: Okay. So, as you look over at Scanlan, with
a big look of relief and thank you, he gives you a

886
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:44,102
cursory look as the hand vanishes.

887
01:02:44,102 --> 01:02:46,306
TRAVIS: What. What?! (screams)

888
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:47,723
SAM: Holding on to him!

889
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:56,950
MATT: He grabs you real fast, and suddenly you
have feathers! What the shit! And, strangely, you

890
01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:07,837
become smarter! As giant eagles have an
intelligence of eight.

891
01:03:07,837 --> 01:03:12,090
LIAM: Quick, come up with a plan!

892
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,624
TRAVIS: It's a new day, baby.

893
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,979
SAM: His brain is just geometry.

894
01:03:16,979 --> 01:03:27,310
MATT: It's a Beautiful Mind moment in the middle
of the sky. Suddenly you understand, the instinct

895
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:32,294
hits you, and (whoosh). You have wings. You feel
Scanlan's tiny hands grasping the back of your neck.

896
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:35,712
SAM: And I just yell at him, dive, motherfucker,
dive!

897
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:37,709
TRAVIS: (caw)

898
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:43,103
MATT: All right. You guys start seeing this happen
in the distance and a little sparkle of hope hits

899
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:53,518
you, whatever it may be. Coming back around to the
top, Umbrasyl is taking a double dash motion. He's past.

900
01:03:53,518 --> 01:03:55,547
LIAM: He got away.

901
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:57,336
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

902
01:03:57,336 --> 01:04:01,390
TRAVIS: Can I see that flurry of black feathers
streaking downwards of this guy?

903
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:05,751
MATT: You do, and it is a perpetual flurry.
They're coming out of nowhere. It is this long,

904
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:10,776
visual line of black feathers that are being
tossed from beneath Vax's flapping cape.

905
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:13,877
TRAVIS: We're going full Point Break terminal
velocity, straight down towards Vax.

906
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:17,237
SAM: I hope I can hold on! There's nothing to grab
onto, is there?

907
01:04:17,237 --> 01:04:19,407
MATT: There's just heavy feathers and digging in.

908
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:26,573
SAM: Luckily, I have a grappling hook. (dink dink
dink)

909
01:04:26,573 --> 01:04:30,521
TRAVIS: Maybe in my dive position I could squeeze
your legs with my wings, how about that?

910
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:34,732
LAURA: You're really smart. You would think to do
that.

911
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:35,791
TRAVIS: I would.

912
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,082
ASHLEY: Yeah, you would.

913
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,450
TRAVIS: I would also think, what idiot was just
flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain?

914
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,085
What a fool.

915
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:48,982
MATT: So as you go into a full dive, that's 80
speed, that's 160 feet. (whoosh) You manage to

916
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:56,291
just crest underneath the plummeting Vax, the
trail of black feathers, trailed by a long line of

917
01:04:56,291 --> 01:05:01,128
brown feathers being plucked out from Scanlan,
feverishly trying to grab onto your back for some

918
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:09,637
sort of purchase. Pain. You deal with pain all the
time. It doesn't dissolve your focus. Vax, I need

919
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:16,558
you to go ahead and attempt to grab onto the eagle
as it swoops beneath you. Go ahead and make a

920
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:21,280
single strength saving throw.

921
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,782
LIAM: No, wait, Luck! I have one last Luck.

922
01:05:23,782 --> 01:05:25,425
MATT: This is the time to use it.

923
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:26,933
LAURA: Oh my god!

924
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:28,468
LIAM: 21.

925
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:34,789
MATT: As the eagle swoops underneath you, you
reach out. You don't even see it, you're looking

926
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:39,873
up into the sky as you plummet, the trail of
feathers going past as you concentrate on the

927
01:05:39,873 --> 01:05:46,247
acceptance you've made to the Raven Queen, and the
understanding that perhaps, if there is a chance

928
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:51,037
to survive, let it be through this leap of faith
you've taken in the direction of an entity that

929
01:05:51,037 --> 01:06:00,455
you've been so fearful of and scoffed at since she
came to you in your dreams. A moment, you see the

930
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:04,759
feathers begin to trail off and subside from
beneath your cloak, and a voice whispers in your

931
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:11,875
ear and says, "Left." Without thinking, your hand
reaches out, without even seeing, and you (impact)

932
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:15,054
grab the edge of Scanlan's cloak.

933
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,563
SAM: Oh no!

934
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:23,132
MATT: As you're dragged behind, you (choking) from
behind.

935
01:06:23,132 --> 01:06:25,323
SAM: It's worth it, it's worth it!

936
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:32,328
MATT: You can barely breathe as the eagle swoops
up, you can feel the heartbeat, the blood flowing

937
01:06:32,328 --> 01:06:38,836
in the back of your head, your ears hot
(heartbeat) as you slowly reach over and grab the

938
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:47,242
back of the eagle. Is this Keyleth? You don't
know. All you know is Scanlan swooped in and in

939
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:56,360
this moment of need, seemingly, a prayer was
answered. So what are you guys doing?

940
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,973
LAURA: And you're itty bitty still!

941
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,025
LIAM: I prefer raven-sized.

942
01:07:00,025 --> 01:07:04,980
MATT: Yeah, he's tiny. That's the only reason I'm
not having him tear you off the back of the eagle,

943
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,567
because of the size.

944
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:10,641
TRAVIS: Unless I hear otherwise, I'm making a
controlled descent towards the ground.

945
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:16,646
MATT: Okay. You guys see this in the distance as
now the eagle captures the falling Vax and then

946
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:23,676
begins to head down towards the base of the
mountain where the Bramblewood meets.

947
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:26,983
LAURA: I guess we head down that direction.

948
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:29,464
ASHLEY: Yeah. Make the eagle follow.

949
01:07:29,464 --> 01:07:36,591
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way downward
towards the bottom. Keyleth, you finish your

950
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:44,745
concentration on the stone. (whoosh) Suddenly, you
step through, being pushed through a tunnel of

951
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:50,897
blue light and energy, and for a moment, all you
see before you is Vax's face, his tiny little

952
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:52,798
raven-sized face.

953
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,330
MARISHA: So cute!

954
01:07:54,330 --> 01:08:05,119
MATT: (whoosh) As you guys watch Keyleth apparate
right in front of Vax, and go speeding past you,

955
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:10,181
as she's now plummeting from the air, having
summoned to your side.

956
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:11,979
MARISHA: I'm technically an earth elemental
still.

957
01:08:11,979 --> 01:08:21,545
MATT: You're still earth elemental? So yeah, you
see Keyleth as a giant boulder that appears at the

958
01:08:21,545 --> 01:08:26,452
side. You have to dodge out of the way (whoosh) as
this giant rock being, out of the corner of your

959
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:34,784
eye, appears before you. However, she sinks
straight past you. You're flying as low as you

960
01:08:34,784 --> 01:08:40,065
can, you're going terminal velocity, and there is
this (rumble) rock entity plummeting at the same rate.

961
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:41,528
TALIESIN: A meteor.

962
01:08:41,528 --> 01:08:45,801
MARISHA: You know, it was a good idea when he was
still in the dragon.

963
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:47,867
MATT: Yeah, I know. It was.

964
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:50,518
LIAM: (singing) I came in like a wrecking ball!

965
01:08:50,518 --> 01:08:53,694
MATT: At about 200 feet up, you continue to
plummet.

966
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:56,245
MARISHA: 200 feet? That's all right.

967
01:08:56,245 --> 01:09:01,613
MATT: All right. You're not doing anything else?
You're going to take the fall?

968
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:12,339
MARISHA: Well, what's below me?

969
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:18,455
MATT: The very edge of the Bramblewood and the
base of the mountain. You're not quite sure where

970
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,928
you'll land. You see treetops and rocks.

971
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:25,871
TALIESIN: What's the worst that's going to
happen?

972
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:29,406
MARISHA: I would hit zero hit points as an earth
elemental and go back to Keyleth.

973
01:09:29,406 --> 01:09:31,748
MATT: And then the rest of the damage would carry
over.

974
01:09:31,748 --> 01:09:36,839
MARISHA: Right, but 200 feet. That's survivable.

975
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,531
MATT: That's 20d6.

976
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:43,407
SAM: You'll be fine. What's that? 60 points.

977
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:48,272
MARISHA: Yeah. It's roughly 60 points, and I've
got 67 left as this earth elemental.

978
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:49,934
MATT: All right, so you're going to take it?

979
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:56,602
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. Wait, wait. If I'm going
to do this, I'm going to do it right. I'm going to

980
01:09:56,602 --> 01:10:01,328
ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands,
that I keep forgetting because I didn't know I

981
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:05,084
could do them in elemental form, by the way.
Thought it was only beast form. I'm going to light

982
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:07,636
myself on fire and go meteor.

983
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:13,232
MATT: All right. You guys watch as the earth
elemental curls up, forms this streak of flame and

984
01:10:13,232 --> 01:10:19,146
smoke behind, and now a plummeting Keyleth meteor
goes slamming into the base of the mountain just

985
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:22,485
past you as you pull up from impacting at terminal
velocity.

986
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:26,989
MARISHA: I was trying to leave an impression. No
pun intended.

987
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,245
MATT: You suffer 76 points of bludgeoning damage
upon impact.

988
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:31,503
SAM: Of Jor-El damage.

989
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:35,155
(laughter)

990
01:10:35,155 --> 01:10:40,850
MATT: (boom) This giant crater is left around your
form as now there is this somewhat smoke-swirled

991
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,747
Keyleth sprawled out in the center of this.

992
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:48,840
MARISHA: I drop, and I stand up, Keyleth, in the
middle of a giant crater.

993
01:10:48,840 --> 01:11:00,978
MATT: The rest of you all eventually catch up. The
eagle-back carriers, you on broomback, finding

994
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:11,396
your party bruised, hurt, but ultimately survived
this moment of the encounter. As you've all had

995
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:19,726
this moment to yourself, Vex, you hear a noise to
your left coming from the exterior of the

996
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:21,293
Bramblewood.

997
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:24,208
LAURA: Can I see what it is?

998
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:30,128
MATT: You glance off to the side, and you can see,
emerging, slowly from the forest, a single

999
01:11:30,128 --> 01:11:33,379
humanoid standing before you.

1000
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:35,172
SAM: Is he single?

1001
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:48,216
MATT: No. You see, slowly coming forward, a woman.
An older woman, an older goliath woman, missing

1002
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:57,290
one eye and missing her forearm-- her left arm,
right at the elbow. The right arm clutches a very

1003
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:03,975
tall quarterstaff that is being used as a walking
stick as she wanders up. You can see dirt smeared

1004
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:09,378
in her face, darker dreadlocks pulled tight
against the back of the head that dangle past the

1005
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:17,961
shoulders, tattoos similar to the ones that adorn
Grog across the face and shoulders. She slowly

1006
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:31,445
walks towards the party. Let's go ahead and bring
our guest for the evening out. You can go around

1007
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:33,741
the other way. Let's welcome Chris Perkins!

1008
01:12:33,741 --> 01:12:37,851
LIAM: Welcome, Chris, welcome!

1009
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:39,291
TALIESIN: Is he coming to this side?

1010
01:12:39,291 --> 01:12:43,268
MATT: Right to the edge, next to you, Keyleth.

1011
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:49,938
SAM: Do you know how to play this game?

1012
01:12:49,938 --> 01:12:51,888
CHRIS: Keyleth meteor, what?

1013
01:12:51,888 --> 01:12:53,735
MARISHA: Yeah, that's me.

1014
01:12:53,735 --> 01:13:00,425
MATT: As she steps up and emerges from the forest,
everyone turns and sees the worry on Vex's face.

1015
01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:08,045
LAURA: (laughs) Vax pours a drink.

1016
01:13:08,045 --> 01:13:10,013
LIAM: It was very frightening.

1017
01:13:10,013 --> 01:13:12,828
LAURA: Halt! Who are you?

1018
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:15,033
CHRIS: My name is Shale.

1019
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:18,429
LAURA: What's your business here?

1020
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:26,439
CHRIS: I was following a scouting party out to the
mountain. But these old bones don't take me as far

1021
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:28,491
as fast as they used to.

1022
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:30,394
TRAVIS: Do I recognize Shale?

1023
01:13:30,394 --> 01:13:35,490
MATT: You do, actually. Not very well. Shale has
been around longer than you have as part of the

1024
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:41,922
herd, but is mostly considered past her prime as a
warrior. Since she lost her arm, was set to the

1025
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:48,565
side, and a lot of the herd seems to not value
their elders when they become less powerful in

1026
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:53,322
battle, but even still, she carries a bit of spit
and vinegar to her. But it's been a while since

1027
01:13:53,322 --> 01:14:00,612
you've seen her, and to see her surviving out
here, both curious and honorable.

1028
01:14:00,612 --> 01:14:02,064
TRAVIS: Shale.

1029
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:04,781
SAM: Sorry. You're still an eagle.

1030
01:14:04,781 --> 01:14:07,175
MATT: (caw)

1031
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:08,873
TRAVIS: (caw)

1032
01:14:08,873 --> 01:14:15,411
SAM: Grog, do you want to say something?

1033
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:20,221
CHRIS: I will brandish my quarterstaff, my
rune-covered quarterstaff, and try to hold this

1034
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:21,748
big creature at bay.

1035
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,878
MATT: Shale's holding her staff out.

1036
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:28,970
CHRIS: Stand down, bird!

1037
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,181
LIAM: I love you! Let me love you!

1038
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:38,324
SAM: All right, all right. I'll drop the form.
I'll drop the form.

1039
01:14:38,324 --> 01:14:42,273
TRAVIS: Thank you, god. Shale.

1040
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:46,477
CHRIS: Grog? Is that you?

1041
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:48,527
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's me. I know, you can't tell.

1042
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:51,126
CHRIS: You're kind of a blur. What's on your
face?

1043
01:14:51,126 --> 01:14:53,150
TRAVIS: It's a beard.

1044
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,647
CHRIS: You've gotten big.

1045
01:14:55,647 --> 01:14:59,785
TRAVIS: Yeah. Lots of lifting. Lots of running,
getting strong.

1046
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:02,372
CHRIS: Last time I saw you, you were the runt of
the goatball team.

1047
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:03,708
TRAVIS: Oh.

1048
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,202
LAURA: You were a runt, Grog?

1049
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:09,986
TRAVIS: No, when I was born, she means. When I was
born.

1050
01:15:09,986 --> 01:15:12,042
LAURA: Was he rather small?

1051
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,493
CHRIS: He was puny.

1052
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:18,184
TRAVIS: Puny compared to mountains and stuff.

1053
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:20,074
ASHLEY: What's goatball?

1054
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:27,895
CHRIS: It's a game you play. You stand on pillars
of rock, and you hurl balls at each other.

1055
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:29,410
LAURA: Made of goats?

1056
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,376
CHRIS: Made of goatskins. Skins, my dear.

1057
01:15:32,376 --> 01:15:34,867
MARISHA: Sounds kind of fun.

1058
01:15:34,867 --> 01:15:39,786
CHRIS: The object of the game is to knock the
other opponents off their pillars.

1059
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:42,206
LIAM: That's more civilized than what we were
imagining.

1060
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:45,955
TRAVIS: It's a lot of fun, actually.

1061
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:50,423
LAURA: Shale, what were you doing out here with a
scouting party? It seems--

1062
01:15:50,423 --> 01:15:54,919
CHRIS: We were spying on the dragon. Damnable
beast.

1063
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:56,819
LAURA: Did you succeed?

1064
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:00,496
CHRIS: No. The scouting team did not fare well.

1065
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:02,685
MARISHA: Are any of them still alive?

1066
01:16:02,685 --> 01:16:04,629
CHRIS: No. They're all dead.

1067
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:06,180
SAM: How did you survive?

1068
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:11,888
CHRIS: I was slow and stupid. I shouldn't have
gone at all. I couldn't keep up with them. By the

1069
01:16:11,888 --> 01:16:13,792
time I got to them, they were corpses.

1070
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:17,585
SAM: You sound like an excellent addition to our
team, then.

1071
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:24,231
CHRIS: She says, I would have killed the dragon
as soon as it came upon us, when we first arrived

1072
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:29,047
in Westruun, but that damn Kevdak formed an
alliance with the beast.

1073
01:16:29,047 --> 01:16:30,890
LAURA: Wait, you think you can kill a dragon?

1074
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,891
ASHLEY: Wait, what did you just say? Oh.

1075
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:34,173
SAM: We knew that.

1076
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,796
ASHLEY: Yes. Realized it as I was saying it.

1077
01:16:36,796 --> 01:16:41,057
CHRIS: That is how I wanted to die. Fighting the
dragon.

1078
01:16:41,057 --> 01:16:46,986
MARISHA: It's funny, we almost just died fighting
the dragon. How ironic.

1079
01:16:46,986 --> 01:16:53,441
TRAVIS: We put a good hurting on it, yeah. Do
you-- I mean, not like I'm questioning what can

1080
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:56,641
you do, because I don't think it's very much.

1081
01:16:56,641 --> 01:17:02,203
MARISHA: I'm actually great. I'm just in a
smoldering meteor and look like a badass.

1082
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:05,841
MATT: Which caught your attention, the large,
crashing boom.

1083
01:17:05,841 --> 01:17:07,271
CHRIS: That was it.

1084
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:13,890
LIAM: I yank on Vex's hand from down below and
say, pick me up! Put me on your shoulder!

1085
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:20,788
LAURA: What's the matter? Can you not see anything
down there? I pop Trinket out and put Vax on top

1086
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:23,830
of him. Don't you feel so tall now?

1087
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,378
LIAM: I am tall.

1088
01:17:25,378 --> 01:17:27,619
MARISHA: How much longer is he going to be tiny?

1089
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:29,092
MATT: How long does the potion last?

1090
01:17:29,092 --> 01:17:30,655
LIAM: I rolled a three, so that's three hours.

1091
01:17:30,655 --> 01:17:31,819
MATT: Yeah, three hours.

1092
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,155
TRAVIS: Sweet.

1093
01:17:33,155 --> 01:17:39,279
LIAM: We have to decide what to do. He's gone back
to his hole. He's going to rest. He's going to heal.

1094
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:43,508
MARISHA: I just have such a hard time taking you
seriously right now. I'm so sorry.

1095
01:17:43,508 --> 01:17:47,632
TRAVIS: So you had to have been a part of this
party for a reason. What's in your bag of tricks?

1096
01:17:47,632 --> 01:17:49,050
What can you do?

1097
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,364
CHRIS: I smash things with my stick.

1098
01:17:51,364 --> 01:17:54,792
TRAVIS: With your stick. Does magic come out of
your stick?

1099
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,429
CHRIS: It is a magical staff.

1100
01:17:56,429 --> 01:17:58,148
TRAVIS: Oh, well, that's good.

1101
01:17:58,148 --> 01:17:59,895
SAM: Yeah, we could use more of those.

1102
01:17:59,895 --> 01:18:02,076
TRAVIS: Is it a magical staff of dragon killing?

1103
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:04,877
CHRIS: It will be if we get on with it.

1104
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:06,983
TRAVIS: I like that.

1105
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:08,904
LIAM: I like her, too.

1106
01:18:08,904 --> 01:18:14,570
MARISHA: So, Shale, did you and your scouting
party find out any additional information that

1107
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,426
might be handy?

1108
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:19,095
LAURA: Maybe how to get into the lair without it
knowing?

1109
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:20,695
MARISHA: What she said.

1110
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:22,156
CHRIS: I know nothing of use.

1111
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,605
LAURA: That's wonderful.

1112
01:18:23,605 --> 01:18:26,529
LIAM: You never made it up to the cave entrance,
did you?

1113
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:29,945
CHRIS: I made it up to the dead ones. That's as
far as I got.

1114
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:31,277
LAURA: How far were the dead ones?

1115
01:18:31,277 --> 01:18:32,919
CHRIS: A ways.

1116
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:36,376
MARISHA: All right.

1117
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:39,559
SAM: I hate to tell you this, but Kevdak is gone.

1118
01:18:39,559 --> 01:18:42,151
CHRIS: No great loss.

1119
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:47,299
SAM: Your whole herd may have perished fighting
this same dragon.

1120
01:18:47,299 --> 01:18:48,692
LIAM: Not all of them.

1121
01:18:48,692 --> 01:18:50,001
MARISHA: A lot of them.

1122
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:55,519
TRAVIS: But it will all be worth it if we can
remove the head of this shitty black dragon.

1123
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:57,222
CHRIS: I agree.

1124
01:18:57,222 --> 01:19:01,472
LAURA: Plus, Zanror is still alive, as is his
wife. I think.

1125
01:19:01,472 --> 01:19:02,444
SAM: Maybe.

1126
01:19:02,444 --> 01:19:03,342
MARISHA: We hope.

1127
01:19:03,342 --> 01:19:04,511
TALIESIN: Possibly.

1128
01:19:04,511 --> 01:19:07,711
TRAVIS: So, how far would you think that we are
from his lair?

1129
01:19:07,711 --> 01:19:09,880
CHRIS: I'll just crane my neck up the mountain.

1130
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:16,409
MATT: It's a sizable climb. Gatshadow-- While this
portion is the south part of the Cliffkeep

1131
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:21,865
Mountains, which get higher the further north you
go, this mountain is called Gatshadow because it

1132
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:25,594
is dark and ominous and stands out amongst the
rest of the mountains. While the other ones crest

1133
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:32,202
at about maybe 4,000 feet up, this one's nearly a
mile, a little over a mile high.

1134
01:19:32,202 --> 01:19:34,201
LAURA: Well, we can obviously fly.

1135
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:40,471
MATT: There are sparse trees, most of them dead or
dried out towards the top, but other than that the

1136
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:42,093
vegetation is pretty sparse.

1137
01:19:42,093 --> 01:19:45,934
TRAVIS: Look, I'm a little jacked up. I think
those two are a little jacked up.

1138
01:19:45,934 --> 01:19:47,899
MARISHA: I could use a short rest.

1139
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:51,019
TRAVIS: It's fair to assume that he will do the
same thing, yeah?

1140
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,217
SAM: Yeah.

1141
01:19:52,217 --> 01:19:54,581
TRAVIS: Go brush his teeth, have a deuce, all that
stuff.

1142
01:19:54,581 --> 01:20:00,692
MARISHA: We're trying to catch the dragon while
he's still debilitated, right?

1143
01:20:00,692 --> 01:20:02,852
LIAM: The longer we wait, the harder it will be.

1144
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:05,239
ASHLEY: What if I just heal everybody and we keep
on?

1145
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:06,665
SAM: Yeah, that's great.

1146
01:20:06,665 --> 01:20:09,365
ASHLEY: I don't want to lose the damage that's on
him.

1147
01:20:09,365 --> 01:20:13,409
SAM: Yeah, heal us and let's keep going. Quickly.
How long has it been, a minute? Two minutes?

1148
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:20,087
MATT: Since you guys landed here? It's probably
been about two, three minutes.

1149
01:20:20,087 --> 01:20:21,884
SAM: We've got to move.

1150
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:24,137
TRAVIS: Can we travel a mile up a mountain
quickly?

1151
01:20:24,137 --> 01:20:25,887
SAM: We have eagles.

1152
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:31,333
MATT: Even at your fastest pace, eagle speed...

1153
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:34,040
LIAM: The broom and the two eagles at this point?

1154
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:40,172
MATT: The broom is slower than the eagles. Eagle
speed you're looking at about-- I'm estimating

1155
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:42,776
somewhere between ten to 20 minutes.

1156
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:52,125
LIAM: That's enough for a short rest for it. He's
not going to go back to full strength, but he's

1157
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,080
going to go back up a bit.

1158
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,222
LAURA: Would we know that?

1159
01:20:56,222 --> 01:20:58,132
MARISHA: We don't know what he has access to.

1160
01:20:58,132 --> 01:21:03,874
MATT: You would know, being as dragons are your
favored enemy, and you have information on that.

1161
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:15,270
Generally, they don't-- They themselves can
recover over time, and if given a full day or so,

1162
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:22,492
they can largely recover from the wounds they have
sustained almost entirely, especially a dragon as

1163
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:31,128
powerful as an ancient. You would know that,
because they understand and fear their demise, or

1164
01:21:31,128 --> 01:21:37,470
at least are arrogant enough to think it's not
possible, they will have certain reserves to try

1165
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:41,875
and help them recover if they ever find themselves
in a dire circumstance. Occasionally, depending on

1166
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:45,776
the intelligence of the dragon and what resources
it has at its disposal.

1167
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:47,666
MARISHA: Reserves. What do you mean?

1168
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:49,231
LAURA: Healing stuff?

1169
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:55,136
MATT: Some semblance of healing magic, items they
may have acquired that can help. The longer you

1170
01:21:55,136 --> 01:21:59,837
wait, the more it can recover, is essentially what
it comes down to.

1171
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:01,834
LIAM: We need to go now. We need to go.

1172
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,807
SAM: Should we mist form it there? Can we do
that?

1173
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:06,985
LAURA: That takes too long to think about.

1174
01:22:06,985 --> 01:22:10,693
MARISHA: I can get us there via trees.

1175
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,721
SAM: But you'd need to know a tree that's there.

1176
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:18,773
MARISHA: I need to know a tree that's there. I
could Scry, look for the closest tree, teleport us

1177
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:22,012
there, but by the time I'm getting there, I'm
exhausted.

1178
01:22:22,012 --> 01:22:25,257
LIAM: Are you able to see a tree from a great
distance?

1179
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:26,719
MARISHA: If I Scry.

1180
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,610
LIAM: Not even by eyesight?

1181
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,581
MARISHA: I mean, I guess I can look around and
take a guess.

1182
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:35,223
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds on
everybody.

1183
01:22:35,223 --> 01:22:41,434
MATT: All right. Go ahead and do that. And Shale,
you feel nice and warm at full health as the Mass

1184
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,281
Cure Wounds tickles you.

1185
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,742
LAURA: Is your arm back?

1186
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:47,770
MATT: Unfortunately, no. If only!

1187
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,530
SAM: The temporary hit points never go back up,
right?

1188
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:54,371
MATT: Correct, no. They were just for that little
bit of damage.

1189
01:22:54,371 --> 01:22:56,234
CHRIS: Lost it in an avalanche, I did.

1190
01:22:56,234 --> 01:22:58,916
SAM: Today?

1191
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:01,223
CHRIS: No, turd.

1192
01:23:01,223 --> 01:23:05,666
MATT: The Scrying will take you about ten minutes
or so.

1193
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:09,104
LAURA: Are we going to Scry it or are we just
going to go? How long would it take if we just

1194
01:23:09,104 --> 01:23:10,637
flew up?

1195
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:13,921
20 minutes?

1196
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:17,562
MATT: That's if you were all on eagle-back. Which
you don't. You have eight people, and you

1197
01:23:17,562 --> 01:23:19,427
currently have two summoned eagles.

1198
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,115
LIAM: Speed of the slowest.

1199
01:23:21,115 --> 01:23:24,604
MATT: Yeah, the speed of the slowest here, you're
looking at walking up the mountain.

1200
01:23:24,604 --> 01:23:31,663
MARISHA: Yeah. So I can teleport us closer and
then walk, or we can take a very short rest so I

1201
01:23:31,663 --> 01:23:38,380
can get my beast shaping back, and then could fly
a few more of us. It's a gamble.

1202
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,203
CHRIS: You take your rest, love. I'll start up the
mountain.

1203
01:23:41,203 --> 01:23:46,746
MATT: Shale walks away and starts hiking up the
rocks at the very base of Gatshadow.

1204
01:23:46,746 --> 01:23:54,278
TRAVIS: Can I just say that we agree that the
reason we didn't do what Zanror wanted and go to

1205
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:57,137
the lair is because it's a fucking death trap?

1206
01:23:57,137 --> 01:24:01,069
SAM: Yes, but the dragon is injured now.

1207
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:04,341
TRAVIS: But he's going to heal up by the time we
get there.

1208
01:24:04,341 --> 01:24:05,599
SAM: Not all the way.

1209
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:06,657
TRAVIS: Pretty good.

1210
01:24:06,657 --> 01:24:08,628
LIAM: It's still the best chance we have. We have
to kill it now.

1211
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:09,827
TRAVIS: In its lair?

1212
01:24:09,827 --> 01:24:12,722
CHRIS: It's your destiny to fight the dragon,
Grog.

1213
01:24:12,722 --> 01:24:15,468
MARISHA: Wait, what? What was that, Shale? Is that
true?

1214
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,858
CHRIS: No, it's not true.

1215
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:19,337
(laughter)

1216
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:25,640
ASHLEY: Everybody is healed 27.

1217
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,524
CHRIS: It's just a thing old women say.

1218
01:24:27,524 --> 01:24:28,851
MARISHA: Just let him believe it.

1219
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:34,039
LIAM: Kiki, may I have my-- Sorry. (higher voice)
May I have my cloak back?

1220
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:37,206
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, sure.

1221
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:40,472
LIAM: Thank you. (flump, whoosh)

1222
01:24:40,472 --> 01:24:42,663
MATT: To attune to it will take you a short rest.

1223
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:44,532
MARISHA: So are we resting?

1224
01:24:44,532 --> 01:24:45,872
MATT: That's up to you guys.

1225
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:47,533
LIAM: I don't know. But I'm still putting it on.

1226
01:24:47,533 --> 01:24:50,131
TRAVIS: When I turned into the eagle, what
happened to the Bloodaxe and chain?

1227
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:54,980
MATT: Actually, you check, and the equipment that
you have attuned to you and attached go into the

1228
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:59,946
form with you, so at this moment you realize, "Oh,
the axe!" You look behind you, and it's just been

1229
01:24:59,946 --> 01:25:04,220
dragging behind you in the dirt, carving this path
in the rocks and rubble.

1230
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:07,961
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's nifty.

1231
01:25:07,961 --> 01:25:11,314
MATT: Like a kid with a deflated balloon you're
just dragging behind you.

1232
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:17,105
LAURA: Can I-- well, I can't sense anything about
it with Hunter's Mark, I just know where he is.

1233
01:25:17,105 --> 01:25:18,467
MATT: You know where it is.

1234
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:19,597
LAURA: And he's up in his lair.

1235
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:22,773
MATT: He is up at the top of Gatshadow, somewhere
in that mountain.

1236
01:25:22,773 --> 01:25:24,657
LAURA: Moving around, or is he chilling?

1237
01:25:24,657 --> 01:25:26,262
MATT: At the moment, seems chilling.

1238
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:30,094
SAM: Let's go.

1239
01:25:30,094 --> 01:25:32,586
MATT: Short rest or not, what are you guys doing?

1240
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,855
MARISHA: How long would the hike up the mountain
be? An hour?

1241
01:25:34,855 --> 01:25:40,025
MATT: It's about a mile up. You're looking at the
better part of a day.

1242
01:25:40,025 --> 01:25:42,043
SAM: Oh, a mile up.

1243
01:25:42,043 --> 01:25:43,119
MATT: Yeah.

1244
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:44,257
LAURA: Unless we fly.

1245
01:25:44,257 --> 01:25:46,102
TALIESIN: What if we take shifts with the eagles?

1246
01:25:46,102 --> 01:25:49,626
MATT: Take shifts with the eagles? Back and
forth?

1247
01:25:49,626 --> 01:25:52,361
TALIESIN: Eagles fly a group up, fly down, pick up
another group and bring them?

1248
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,090
MATT: Probably about an hour.

1249
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:56,013
TALIESIN: But that's an hour with a short rest for
everybody as well.

1250
01:25:56,013 --> 01:25:58,796
MATT: If you're going to do it that way, yeah.

1251
01:25:58,796 --> 01:26:01,697
LIAM: Half could rest at the top while the eagles
fly back, and the ones at the bottom could rest.

1252
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:03,871
TALIESIN: So there's a short rest.

1253
01:26:03,871 --> 01:26:07,606
LIAM: Shifts of resting, yeah.

1254
01:26:07,606 --> 01:26:09,906
MATT: You're still looking at about an hour and a
half at that point, with people moving there and

1255
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:14,700
back and getting enough rest. You can't short rest
on the trip, and the short rest is about an hour,

1256
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,251
half an hour.

1257
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:20,302
LIAM: Eagles drop off, they rest while the eagles
return, and the people at the bottom rest while

1258
01:26:20,302 --> 01:26:22,175
the eagles are making the trip, no?

1259
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:25,242
MATT: Right, but you still have to have the eagles
that went to the bottom to pick up the second team

1260
01:26:25,242 --> 01:26:29,824
to get there, so you're still looking at about an
hour and a half to two hours.

1261
01:26:29,824 --> 01:26:35,133
LAURA: I could also use another spell and summon a
couple more eagles.

1262
01:26:35,133 --> 01:26:37,692
SAM: Sure.

1263
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,293
LAURA: I could summon two more eagles.

1264
01:26:40,293 --> 01:26:41,824
LIAM: That's worth it.

1265
01:26:41,824 --> 01:26:44,597
LAURA: And that could get how many of us up?

1266
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:45,907
LIAM: All of us up at the same time.

1267
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:47,988
SAM: But one is just for Grog, right?

1268
01:26:47,988 --> 01:26:50,032
LAURA: But two more eagles would get all of us
up?

1269
01:26:50,032 --> 01:26:55,525
MATT: It's a concentration spell. You can only
have one of it up at a time.

1270
01:26:55,525 --> 01:26:57,692
LAURA: It is?

1271
01:26:57,692 --> 01:27:01,301
MATT: Yeah. And it only lasts for an hour, and
you've already been at this for probably about

1272
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:03,571
ten, 15 minutes.

1273
01:27:03,571 --> 01:27:05,704
LAURA: So they're about to go away.

1274
01:27:05,704 --> 01:27:07,069
MATT: You have about another 40 minutes of the
eagles.

1275
01:27:07,069 --> 01:27:08,992
MARISHA: So we couldn't do round trips anyway.
They'd dissipate.

1276
01:27:09,047 --> 01:27:10,371
MATT: You'd just have to recast it.

1277
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:11,733
MARISHA: Well, yeah.

1278
01:27:11,733 --> 01:27:17,550
SAM: That seems like our fastest option. What's
the other option? A short rest and then we bamf.

1279
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:23,820
MARISHA: We rest and then go. If we rest for 30
minutes, and then I switch and then we have the

1280
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:27,875
eagles, then we can get up in another 30 minutes,
and then it's an hour. Theoretically, short

1281
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,477
resting is our shortest.

1282
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:34,221
MATT: You said you have Transport Via Plants,
right?

1283
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:35,529
MARISHA: I do.

1284
01:27:35,529 --> 01:27:39,784
MATT: If you wanted to Scry up that mountain and
look at one of the trees at the top, you could do

1285
01:27:39,784 --> 01:27:41,956
that. That would be, technically, the fastest
way.

1286
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:44,316
MARISHA: But then we'd still have to hike. How
long would the hike be?

1287
01:27:44,316 --> 01:27:49,272
MATT: It depends on how close the nearest tree to
the cavern would be.

1288
01:27:49,272 --> 01:27:51,594
SAM: Let's do that.

1289
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:57,821
MARISHA: I'm tapping myself-- I can do it, but I'm
tapping myself out. I'm burning literally all my

1290
01:27:57,821 --> 01:28:01,893
top level spells and I have no beast shapes left.
But I can do it. It's what we think is most

1291
01:28:01,893 --> 01:28:02,984
important.

1292
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:06,879
LAURA: What if we use the eagles, send them up.
Once they're used up, they're gone at the top, and

1293
01:28:06,879 --> 01:28:11,893
then I'll just summon two more and send everybody
else up? Once the people make it up the top, that

1294
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:17,313
way it takes less time. A couple people hop on the
eagles right now, because we only have a little

1295
01:28:17,313 --> 01:28:18,527
bit of time left.

1296
01:28:18,527 --> 01:28:21,901
MARISHA: Can I rest? Can I rest while the first
round goes?

1297
01:28:21,901 --> 01:28:23,221
MATT: Sure.

1298
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:25,069
TRAVIS: We're fighting a dragon in its lair! In
the worst place we could possibly fight it!

1299
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:26,952
SAM: We've also dealt so much damage to it.

1300
01:28:26,952 --> 01:28:29,769
MATT: Umbrasyl was looking pretty rough.

1301
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:32,345
SAM: I fisted through it!

1302
01:28:32,345 --> 01:28:33,823
TALIESIN: He said looking pretty rough.

1303
01:28:33,823 --> 01:28:40,491
TRAVIS: That's because he's a liar and a bringer
of death, and he is smiling at you while he does it.

1304
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:41,672
TALIESIN: I know.

1305
01:28:41,672 --> 01:28:45,242
SAM: What are we going to do today with Chris
Perkins? Talk, or go fucking kill a dragon?

1306
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:50,244
TALIESIN: Would you like a tour of Whitestone?
It's really lovely this time of year.

1307
01:28:50,244 --> 01:28:52,381
CHRIS: I'm judging you!

1308
01:28:52,381 --> 01:28:58,169
LIAM: Grog, she's right. It is your destiny.

1309
01:28:58,169 --> 01:29:01,876
TRAVIS: In your tiny voice.

1310
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:03,881
LIAM: What are you laughing at?

1311
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:06,018
LAURA: Everybody hop on an eagle.

1312
01:29:06,018 --> 01:29:07,362
ASHLEY: I hop on an eagle.

1313
01:29:07,362 --> 01:29:08,461
TALIESIN: Hopping on an eagle.

1314
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:10,120
SAM: Well, no, half of the people hop on an
eagle.

1315
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,448
LAURA: Two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes
can get on.

1316
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,601
ASHLEY: Scanlan.

1317
01:29:13,601 --> 01:29:16,376
SAM: I'm in back?

1318
01:29:16,376 --> 01:29:17,553
ASHLEY: Yes.

1319
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:19,048
LIAM: I'm sort of a halfling. Can I get on too?

1320
01:29:19,048 --> 01:29:23,766
MATT: At your size? The three of you would
probably be able to take one eagle, because you

1321
01:29:23,766 --> 01:29:25,185
are tiny.

1322
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:26,916
SAM: Oh, that's right, he's a little one.

1323
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:28,280
LAURA: All right. You guys go.

1324
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,021
LIAM: See you in a bit, sis! Bye, Keek!

1325
01:29:30,021 --> 01:29:35,698
MATT: So we'll say, for the purposes of this,
it'll take an additional cast of your spell, so

1326
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:40,133
mark off a second casting of Conjure Woodland
Beings. However, that brings-- What level is that?

1327
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:49,207
LAURA: That is level-- Oh, good. Level three.

1328
01:29:49,207 --> 01:29:50,826
MATT: Conjure Woodland Beings?

1329
01:29:50,826 --> 01:29:54,048
LAURA: So I've got two level threes left. With my
Pearl of power.

1330
01:29:54,048 --> 01:29:56,987
MATT: Conjure Woodland Beings is a 4th-level
spell, Laura.

1331
01:29:56,987 --> 01:30:00,657
LAURA: I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland
Beings.

1332
01:30:00,657 --> 01:30:03,577
MATT: Animals, there we go. Sorry, so yeah, that is
3rd-level. So yeah, mark off your second casting

1333
01:30:03,577 --> 01:30:10,226
there. You guys manage to make a short rest
between the journeys, making your way up towards

1334
01:30:10,226 --> 01:30:18,731
the dark, blackened rock peak of Gatshadow. We're
going to take a short break here for restroom.

1335
01:30:18,731 --> 01:30:23,375
We'll be back here in a few minutes. In the
meantime we have an awesome video from Backblaze

1336
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:24,750
to show you guys--

1337
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,885
ASHLEY: Yay!

1338
01:30:25,885 --> 01:30:27,151
TALIESIN: It's really cute.

1339
01:30:27,151 --> 01:30:28,493
MARISHA: It's for you guys!

1340
01:30:28,493 --> 01:30:32,986
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes guys,
stay tuned for apparently the attack on Umbrasyl's

1341
01:30:32,986 --> 01:30:35,405
lair. See you in a minute.

1342
01:30:35,405 --> 01:44:49,977
[break]

1343
01:44:49,977 --> 01:44:54,063
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. We've had a little
break here. A quick announcement for you guys, the

1344
01:44:54,063 --> 01:44:59,133
rebroadcast tonight will be delayed for about 30
minutes as we have to shoot something directly

1345
01:44:59,133 --> 01:45:03,602
after this so we can all go home. So, if you guys
are in chat after and folks are showing up going,

1346
01:45:03,602 --> 01:45:07,993
"Where's the rebroadcast?" Just let them know
it'll be around, about a 20-30 minute break

1347
01:45:07,993 --> 01:45:13,782
between. We appreciate you guys carrying that
thread over to them when they arrive. So we've had a

1348
01:45:13,782 --> 01:45:17,675
break. If you wanted to use any of your hit dice
to heal up during the short rest, now's the time

1349
01:45:17,675 --> 01:45:30,539
to do it. You've re-attuned to the Dragon Slayer
Longsword. And just so you guys know, both Grog

1350
01:45:30,539 --> 01:45:39,242
and Vax leveled up to 14 as well. Vax took a level
of paladin during the short rest. Grog also took

1351
01:45:39,242 --> 01:45:43,769
his 14th level as a barbarian. As a berserker, a
lot of you know what that means.

1352
01:45:43,769 --> 01:45:46,132
SAM: I don't know what that means.

1353
01:45:46,132 --> 01:45:52,391
LIAM: We'll find out. I'd like to re-attune
to the Cloak of Displacement. And the Boots of

1354
01:45:52,391 --> 01:45:57,353
Haste, are they spent for the day for anybody? If
I were to wear them, could I get the juice or no?

1355
01:45:57,353 --> 01:45:58,497
They're done?

1356
01:45:58,497 --> 01:46:00,024
LAURA: They're too big for you, teeny.

1357
01:46:00,024 --> 01:46:07,044
LIAM: They would shrink to me. I'm going to
re-attune my Keen Dagger, then, for the moment. So

1358
01:46:07,044 --> 01:46:12,763
it's Deathwalkers Ward, Keen Dagger, Cloak. Three
items.

1359
01:46:12,763 --> 01:46:17,783
MATT: Okay. I'll let it happen. Usually, you
attune one item in a short rest.

1360
01:46:17,783 --> 01:46:19,307
LIAM: Oh, okay. No, I can do one.

1361
01:46:19,307 --> 01:46:24,081
MATT: I think it's fine for this. You get attuned
as you walk up the rest of the way. It's fine.

1362
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:25,867
TRAVIS: I've rolled all nine of my hit dice.

1363
01:46:25,867 --> 01:46:27,248
MATT: So you're out of hit dice?

1364
01:46:27,248 --> 01:46:28,199
TRAVIS: Yes.

1365
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:31,523
MATT: All right. Everyone else good? Ready to jump
back in?

1366
01:46:31,523 --> 01:46:32,861
TALIESIN: Nope.

1367
01:46:32,861 --> 01:46:34,361
MATT: (laughs)

1368
01:46:34,361 --> 01:46:43,019
SAM: Does anyone need more healing? Are we
okay?

1369
01:46:43,019 --> 01:46:45,984
MARISHA: Yeah, we're good.

1370
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:50,712
LAURA: And because I Conjured Woodland Animals,
I lost my Hunter's Mark.

1371
01:46:50,712 --> 01:46:55,108
MATT: Yes, you did, but you know loosely where it
was.

1372
01:46:55,108 --> 01:46:56,628
SAM: All right, let's hurry.

1373
01:46:56,628 --> 01:47:09,577
MATT: As you guys slowly make your way up towards
the peak of Gatshadow, you all come to rest maybe,

1374
01:47:09,577 --> 01:47:16,287
from what best you can tell, is the entrance
cavern that Umbrasyl currently calls its home.

1375
01:47:16,287 --> 01:47:25,912
Across this blackened, dark craggy surface, you
see clumps of dead, petrified trees. Leafless,

1376
01:47:25,912 --> 01:47:37,302
gnarled, and devoid of any life. There are signs of
melted stone, soot. Long ago, there may have been

1377
01:47:37,302 --> 01:47:43,350
a fire that claimed the top of this mountain and
set its visual presentation that got its name.

1378
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:50,791
However, this is your moment, should you wish to
make your way towards your conflict with Umbrasyl.

1379
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:52,630
How do you wish to prepare?

1380
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:57,412
LAURA: I want to sleep for a day.

1381
01:47:57,412 --> 01:48:00,593
MARISHA: Yeah. I want to rock back and forth in a
corner.

1382
01:48:00,593 --> 01:48:06,609
LIAM: I'd like to go stealth and I'd like to see--
is there one clear, main entrance to this place?

1383
01:48:06,609 --> 01:48:09,947
MATT: There is a cavern opening.

1384
01:48:09,947 --> 01:48:10,959
LIAM: Yes.

1385
01:48:10,959 --> 01:48:17,808
MATT: There are a few small little inlets into the
mountain at certain points, but the path that you

1386
01:48:17,808 --> 01:48:22,054
guys land on that ends? You're going to have to
climb around the mountain to get to the entrance

1387
01:48:22,054 --> 01:48:27,351
of this. There is no walk-up path. Actually,
just an opening on the side of the mountain.

1388
01:48:27,351 --> 01:48:31,548
LIAM: So we're further down still. We're not near
the entrance?

1389
01:48:31,548 --> 01:48:34,770
MATT: You're about 400 to 500 feet away from the
entrance.

1390
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:37,177
LAURA: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on
all of us.

1391
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:40,987
MATT: You stealth ahead and look a little bit and
you notice the path comes to an end. You probably

1392
01:48:40,987 --> 01:48:44,343
have about a hundred feet that you have to scale
the side of mountain to get to the entrance.

1393
01:48:44,343 --> 01:48:49,313
LIAM: From where I am, I can tell that we need to
climb around it. If I look very hard, do I see any

1394
01:48:49,313 --> 01:48:51,600
little holes or cracks or anything above?

1395
01:48:51,600 --> 01:49:00,232
MATT: You see one other small entrance about
maybe 60 feet below it, a little bit to the left.

1396
01:49:00,232 --> 01:49:04,496
LIAM: All right.

1397
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:07,150
SAM: Pretty cool sound effects

1398
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,783
CHRIS: It's freaking me out.

1399
01:49:08,783 --> 01:49:11,752
LAURA: Is that your music?

1400
01:49:11,752 --> 01:49:16,915
MATT: That is not my music. That's the
atmosphere.

1401
01:49:16,915 --> 01:49:22,491
TALIESIN: Shale, Shale. The scouting party. Where
did you find the bodies? Where were they left?

1402
01:49:22,491 --> 01:49:28,727
MATT: Which actually you-- this was probably a
couple hundred feet back. They made it near the

1403
01:49:28,727 --> 01:49:34,060
peak. However, they were spotted upon the
approach, and you heard the battle. The very short

1404
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:38,063
battle that ensued. Heard the screams of them, far
from your eyesight.

1405
01:49:38,063 --> 01:49:40,111
CHRIS: I will have pointed them out, then.

1406
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:41,248
MATT: Yeah.

1407
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:44,147
LIAM: So that's why I cast Pass Without a Trace on
us.

1408
01:49:44,147 --> 01:49:49,013
LIAM: How far above our position is that smaller
entrance--

1409
01:49:49,013 --> 01:49:53,594
(noise of hissing gas)

1410
01:49:53,594 --> 01:50:01,747
MATT: It's all atmosphere, guys. I paid them to do
it. I know. All right. Towards where the actual

1411
01:50:01,747 --> 01:50:10,581
walkable portion of this mountain cliff ends, you
have about 40 feet of scaleable wall, at an upward

1412
01:50:10,581 --> 01:50:18,025
angle, before you can reach that small little
inlet that you saw there. An additional 60 feet

1413
01:50:18,025 --> 01:50:24,651
beyond that is the larger entrance where you saw,
the best you can tell, Umbrasyl retreat towards--

1414
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:30,300
or exit before, when you were watching him emerge
from the mountain. That's it.

1415
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,992
LIAM: What do you think? Do you think I should
climb in that little hole?

1416
01:50:33,992 --> 01:50:36,196
LAURA: Do you want-- say that again?

1417
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:42,494
LIAM: There's a main entrance above. But there's
also a smaller, little gap lower down. He cannot

1418
01:50:42,494 --> 01:50:43,838
fit in there.

1419
01:50:43,838 --> 01:50:46,236
MARISHA: I can try and scry inside the cavern.

1420
01:50:46,236 --> 01:50:49,733
LAURA: See if it's something that would be
worth--

1421
01:50:49,733 --> 01:50:52,188
MARISHA: Get a battle perspective?

1422
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:53,283
LAURA: Yeah.

1423
01:50:53,283 --> 01:50:57,181
MARISHA: All right. You have to give me a few
minutes. Is everyone all right with that?

1424
01:50:57,181 --> 01:51:04,093
LAURA: Can I use my ranger skills to try to
camouflage us into the side of the mountain? To

1425
01:51:04,093 --> 01:51:05,863
make us even more non-seeable?

1426
01:51:05,863 --> 01:51:12,899
MATT: Yeah. Totally. So we'll say for the
purposes of that, anyone at this point who'd like

1427
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:16,964
to make a stealth check, to go ahead and keep
yourselves hidden from any onlooking parties.

1428
01:51:16,964 --> 01:51:18,402
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1429
01:51:18,402 --> 01:51:19,586
LAURA: Add ten.

1430
01:51:19,586 --> 01:51:20,590
LIAM: Natural 20!

1431
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:21,593
MARISHA: Hey!

1432
01:51:21,593 --> 01:51:23,739
MATT: Add ten for Pass Without a Trace.

1433
01:51:23,739 --> 01:51:25,581
SAM: 17.

1434
01:51:25,581 --> 01:51:26,645
TALIESIN: 24.

1435
01:51:26,645 --> 01:51:27,746
CHRIS: 22.

1436
01:51:27,746 --> 01:51:29,532
TRAVIS: 16.

1437
01:51:29,532 --> 01:51:30,934
ASHLEY: 29.

1438
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,468
ALL: Whoa!

1439
01:51:33,468 --> 01:51:34,782
ASHLEY: What?!

1440
01:51:34,782 --> 01:51:36,260
(laughter)

1441
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,631
LIAM: Why, I do declare.

1442
01:51:37,631 --> 01:51:39,521
ASHLEY: Well, I do declare I'm invisible.

1443
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:42,366
MATT: The armored cleric cannot be seen.

1444
01:51:42,366 --> 01:51:44,627
(laughter)

1445
01:51:44,627 --> 01:51:46,788
LAURA: 32.

1446
01:51:46,788 --> 01:51:55,188
MATT: With Vex's help, you guys manage to take
bits of the mud, soot, and the burnt remnants of the once

1447
01:51:55,297 --> 01:52:01,309
lush forest that dotted this mountainside, and
darken your exteriors to help obscure the vision

1448
01:52:01,309 --> 01:52:05,931
of anything that wished to pry, along with the
magic drawing the shadows to your forms. You're

1449
01:52:05,931 --> 01:52:10,773
pretty confident that most of you would be fairly
difficult to be spotted by most creatures.

1450
01:52:10,773 --> 01:52:14,111
LIAM: I would just like to point out that my
complete total is 45.

1451
01:52:14,111 --> 01:52:16,995
ASHLEY: Of stealthing?

1452
01:52:16,995 --> 01:52:19,194
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out.

1453
01:52:19,194 --> 01:52:20,530
LIAM: Yes. It's mostly for your benefit.

1454
01:52:20,821 --> 01:52:21,918
LAURA: I appreciate it.

1455
01:52:21,918 --> 01:52:22,917
MATT: That's ridiculous.

1456
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,124
ASHLEY and LAURA: How?

1457
01:52:24,124 --> 01:52:28,957
LIAM: Natural 20, plus my 15 benefit, plus Pass
Without a Trace. Poof! (vanishing sound)

1458
01:52:28,957 --> 01:52:40,288
MATT: You've stealthed through time. People who
had seen you previously in your past, have no

1459
01:52:40,288 --> 01:52:42,057
recollection of ever actually seeing you.

1460
01:52:42,057 --> 01:52:43,489
(laughter)

1461
01:52:43,489 --> 01:52:45,915
LIAM: Marty McFly's holding a photograph.

1462
01:52:45,915 --> 01:52:50,973
MATT: Exactly. All right. So, what's up now?

1463
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:54,391
MARISHA: I take a little of the soot, and I give
myself some druid battle make-up.

1464
01:52:54,391 --> 01:52:56,244
MATT: There you go, just smear it.

1465
01:52:56,244 --> 01:52:57,795
LAURA: Yeah. Did you scry yet?

1466
01:52:57,795 --> 01:52:59,648
MARISHA: I'm about to.

1467
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:06,648
LAURA: Okay. I do the same thing. I soot my face
up, too. Let's all make battle paint while she's

1468
01:53:06,648 --> 01:53:07,910
scrying.

1469
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:09,478
TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

1470
01:53:09,478 --> 01:53:11,327
(laughter)

1471
01:53:11,327 --> 01:53:12,662
MARISHA: Pretentious asshole.

1472
01:53:12,662 --> 01:53:14,329
ASHLEY: I want to do a hand.

1473
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:16,870
(laughter)

1474
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:21,080
LAURA: I get soot on my finger and walk up to
Percy and just put a line from his forehead down

1475
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,793
his face.

1476
01:53:22,793 --> 01:53:24,736
TALIESIN: I feel violated, but thank you.

1477
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:32,990
CHRIS: I'll ask Grog if he wants any soot on his
face. I'll walk over.

1478
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:37,953
TRAVIS: I'll put soot on your face if you come
near me with that wicked, wicked staff of yours.

1479
01:53:37,953 --> 01:53:44,500
CHRIS: This is not wicked. It's just a staff. It
doesn't even have a name.

1480
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:47,621
TRAVIS: What?! How could you have a staff and not
give it a name?

1481
01:53:47,621 --> 01:53:49,837
CHRIS: Only men name their things.

1482
01:53:49,837 --> 01:53:50,877
(laughter)

1483
01:53:50,877 --> 01:53:54,268
MARISHA: Yeah. My staff doesn't have a name. It's
so true.

1484
01:53:54,268 --> 01:54:01,524
CHRIS: You know, if you kill this dragon, you'll
be the greatest goliath that's ever lived.

1485
01:54:01,524 --> 01:54:03,409
TRAVIS: No.

1486
01:54:03,409 --> 01:54:04,331
CHRIS: Yes!

1487
01:54:04,331 --> 01:54:05,738
TRAVIS: Really?

1488
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:09,750
CHRIS: No one else has killed a dragon of this
size. Not among us. Not among the Herd.

1489
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:11,519
ASHLEY: Grog.

1490
01:54:11,519 --> 01:54:13,100
TRAVIS: Pike killed a dragon.

1491
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:14,474
CHRIS: Did you, now?

1492
01:54:14,474 --> 01:54:18,842
ASHLEY: Well, we all did. But it wasn't this big.

1493
01:54:18,842 --> 01:54:20,988
LAURA: It was pretty small.

1494
01:54:20,988 --> 01:54:23,333
ASHLEY: It was pretty-- it was a lot bigger than
me.

1495
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:30,044
CHRIS: I'm sure that experience will come in
handy.

1496
01:54:30,044 --> 01:54:33,382
SAM: All right, let's do this.

1497
01:54:33,382 --> 01:54:35,513
MARISHA: All right. I scry. I focus really
hard on the dragon.

1498
01:54:35,513 --> 01:54:41,443
MATT: Okay. On Umbrasyl?

1499
01:54:41,443 --> 01:54:43,229
MARISHA: Yeah.

1500
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:48,523
SAM: Do you need any of his stomach bile to help
you scry?

1501
01:54:48,523 --> 01:54:52,168
MARISHA: Sure! Can I have some of the-- I scrape a
little stomach bile--

1502
01:54:52,168 --> 01:54:54,748
SAM: Does that help? Does that help?

1503
01:54:54,748 --> 01:54:59,425
MATT: Well, here. Let me pull up the actual
specifics for Scrying here.

1504
01:54:59,425 --> 01:55:01,284
CHRIS: This is going to go well, I can feel it.

1505
01:55:01,284 --> 01:55:10,335
MARISHA: Wait. He's going to sense what I can
scry, can't he? Maybe I can just try and scry

1506
01:55:10,335 --> 01:55:11,916
inside the lair?

1507
01:55:11,916 --> 01:55:13,443
MATT: It largely depends.

1508
01:55:13,443 --> 01:55:15,465
SAM: What do you want to do?

1509
01:55:15,465 --> 01:55:17,104
MARISHA: I mean, he knows we're coming, yeah?

1510
01:55:17,104 --> 01:55:21,725
LAURA: Can you scry that little cavern to see where it
leads to? Can you scry your mind up the cavern?

1511
01:55:21,725 --> 01:55:24,784
MARISHA: Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's
a camera drone?

1512
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:28,560
MATT: It's more like picking a location, as
opposed to an actual--

1513
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:33,109
MARISHA: Sure. I want to try and focus on
Umbrasyl's whereabouts, but I want to see if I

1514
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:37,123
can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the
cavern.

1515
01:55:37,123 --> 01:55:45,989
MATT: Okay. You are familiar with the target as
you've done battles, that does adjust the saving

1516
01:55:45,989 --> 01:55:51,318
throw for the scry. So, without further ado, what's
the DC of your spells currently?

1517
01:55:51,318 --> 01:55:52,695
MARISHA: 19.

1518
01:55:52,695 --> 01:56:06,392
MATT: 19. Hmm. As your eyes close, your vision
projects itself beyond your form, beyond the

1519
01:56:06,392 --> 01:56:13,773
craggy landscape of Gatshadow, out beyond the
mountain pass that ends abruptly. Beyond the

1520
01:56:13,773 --> 01:56:19,282
cavern entrance, you are pulled within the
darkness. Suddenly, you find a little bit of light

1521
01:56:19,282 --> 01:56:28,942
scatters across the damp stonework of the inside
of this cavern. You see stalagmites. You see pools

1522
01:56:28,942 --> 01:56:39,217
of murky, greenish-brackish liquid, ever so gently
disturbed by the wind that curls in and out of

1523
01:56:39,217 --> 01:56:47,588
this cavern. You see towards the back an elevated
platform next to another pool, where a large

1524
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:53,548
outcropping of stone that has just slowly pulled
itself out of the rock, nearly touching the very

1525
01:56:53,548 --> 01:57:12,474
height of this cavern. You don't see anything in
there. All you hear is (low breathing sound).

1526
01:57:12,474 --> 01:57:14,086
SAM: He's asleep.

1527
01:57:14,086 --> 01:57:16,700
CHRIS: (loudly) What do you see?

1528
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,818
MARISHA: Ah!

1529
01:57:18,818 --> 01:57:21,352
(laughter)

1530
01:57:21,352 --> 01:57:28,919
MARISHA: Well, nothing now. That's it? That's all
I see?

1531
01:57:28,919 --> 01:57:31,414
MATT: That's all you see.

1532
01:57:31,414 --> 01:57:33,281
LAURA: Did you see Umbrasyl?

1533
01:57:33,281 --> 01:57:43,012
MARISHA: No, but I heard him. He sounds very
rough, or possibly sleeping? I don't know, there

1534
01:57:43,012 --> 01:57:50,010
was a lot of heavy breathing. Very deep-- not, you
know, shallow breathing. Not impassioned

1535
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:51,405
breathing, Scanlan.

1536
01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:53,266
LAURA: Could he still be invisible?

1537
01:57:53,266 --> 01:58:00,027
MARISHA: He could I guess still be
invisible. Also the cave was covered in acid pools

1538
01:58:00,027 --> 01:58:02,769
and dark and dingy and everything else we would
expect.

1539
01:58:02,769 --> 01:58:03,828
LAURA: Yeah.

1540
01:58:03,828 --> 01:58:09,059
MARISHA: I know.

1541
01:58:09,059 --> 01:58:11,034
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

1542
01:58:11,034 --> 01:58:13,758
SAM: Okay. We're going in the small hole or the
big hole?

1543
01:58:13,758 --> 01:58:19,364
MARISHA: I don't think he caught my presence. I
don't think he's necessarily expecting us. We can

1544
01:58:19,364 --> 01:58:21,337
have the element of surprise, here.

1545
01:58:21,337 --> 01:58:26,381
LIAM: Let me check out that hole on top. You guys
can watch me do it.

1546
01:58:26,381 --> 01:58:28,005
LAURA: Go in the little hole, then.

1547
01:58:28,005 --> 01:58:31,701
LIAM: I'm little now. It's a big hole. It's quite
big, actually.

1548
01:58:31,701 --> 01:58:32,988
LAURA: It's roomy.

1549
01:58:32,988 --> 01:58:34,432
LIAM: I'd like to climb up to it.

1550
01:58:34,432 --> 01:58:36,872
MATT: Okay. Go ahead--

1551
01:58:36,872 --> 01:58:38,760
LIAM: Spider-sense tingling the whole time.

1552
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:44,700
MATT: All right. So you manage to find bits of
rock and pull yourself across the way. It's not

1553
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,998
too long a distance but enough to the point where I
need you to go ahead and make a basic strength check.

1554
01:58:48,998 --> 01:58:51,538
LIAM: 14.

1555
01:58:51,538 --> 01:58:58,162
MATT: 14. Okay. It's hard and you feel part of
your muscles build up lactic acid from the

1556
01:58:58,162 --> 01:59:03,540
exertion, from the previous round with Umbrasyl
and you not being necessarily the strongest

1557
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:08,911
individual of the troupe, but you do manage to
scurry your way up to the edge of this small

1558
01:59:08,911 --> 01:59:17,966
opening in the mountainside. Getting inside, you
get a look: this hole continues for about 15 feet

1559
01:59:17,966 --> 01:59:23,515
into the mountain before it ends abruptly. The
only other thing you notice is there are

1560
01:59:23,515 --> 01:59:36,134
currently four long-dead skeleton corpses within
this hole. Perhaps some sort of mountain-climbing

1561
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:44,766
expedition or travelers that found their way
there, and couldn't escape. There are remnants of

1562
01:59:44,766 --> 01:59:52,877
a small camp. Perhaps a small fire that is long
iced-over through winters past. A layer of dust

1563
01:59:52,877 --> 01:59:58,135
sits on everything and other than the occasional
gust of wind that finds its way in here, largely

1564
01:59:58,135 --> 01:59:59,828
undisturbed for a long period of time.

1565
01:59:59,828 --> 02:00:02,076
LIAM: I want to look through the remains.

1566
02:00:02,076 --> 02:00:09,448
MATT: Okay. You rummage through the remains. You
find roughly 85 gold pieces amongst their corpses

1567
02:00:09,448 --> 02:00:11,872
and spare change in silver and copper--

1568
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:13,090
LIAM: I don't take that.

1569
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:23,768
MATT: Copper. The pennies of D&amp;D. Poor things.
Copper dragons everywhere are just so

1570
02:00:23,768 --> 02:00:33,288
disappointed. You do find an oil lantern, climbing
gear for four people, some long-spoiled rations.

1571
02:00:33,288 --> 02:00:39,886
And you find a very moldy diary.

1572
02:00:39,886 --> 02:00:46,008
LIAM: I take out the Flametongue Dagger and give
myself some light.

1573
02:00:46,008 --> 02:00:52,013
MATT: As you're scanning through most of the pages
that are still intact and not completely molded

1574
02:00:52,013 --> 02:01:00,816
over or destroyed, it appears to be a journal that
contains writings of what was an expedition to

1575
02:01:00,816 --> 02:01:10,364
reach the peak of Gatshadow, because there was
some sort of movement, some sort of activity up

1576
02:01:10,364 --> 02:01:18,750
there that nobody could really discern. The rumors
speak of some sort of creature that would stalk out in

1577
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:32,417
the night and steal mountain goats. (belches) Pardon me.
Goats! Steal mountain goats, steal or find and

1578
02:01:32,417 --> 02:01:35,912
kill anybody who lived in-- there used to be a
smaller village that lived north on the

1579
02:01:35,912 --> 02:01:40,322
mountainscape that is now abandoned because of
this creature the folklore of the time said

1580
02:01:40,322 --> 02:01:45,721
supposedly lived at the top of the mountain. It speaks
of the entrance, the place that Umbrasyl now calls

1581
02:01:45,721 --> 02:01:52,349
the lair, and this leads you to believe that this
is a fresh lair. Umbrasyl did not appear to always

1582
02:01:52,349 --> 02:01:58,818
live within Gatshadow, but is only currently
making it its lair at the moment.

1583
02:01:58,818 --> 02:02:02,820
LIAM: Is this a dead end? Does it look like it
goes further in?

1584
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:04,294
MATT: Make a perception check.

1585
02:02:04,294 --> 02:02:05,741
LIAM: By the light of my dagger.

1586
02:02:05,741 --> 02:02:08,029
MATT: Actually, this would be investigation.

1587
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:13,104
LIAM: Investigation? All right. 20. No, wait--
Yeah, 20.

1588
02:02:13,104 --> 02:02:20,221
MATT: 20. Feeling along the walls, you find
elements of the rocks that are easier to break off

1589
02:02:20,221 --> 02:02:24,337
than others, but this is predominantly the end of
this cavern.

1590
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:28,846
LIAM: It's a cave. Okay. I tell my sister: it's a
dead end. It's nothing. Coming.

1591
02:02:28,846 --> 02:02:37,632
MATT: So Vax finds his way back to the group.

1592
02:02:37,632 --> 02:02:47,576
SAM: It's a dead end? Jesus. This ain't going to be good.
Shale, would you like to lead the way?

1593
02:02:47,576 --> 02:02:53,256
CHRIS: Yes. Now, I may not survive this. I'm quite
old, and I can only see about 30 feet ahead of me--

1594
02:02:53,256 --> 02:02:55,415
LAURA: Well then, maybe she doesn't lead the way.

1595
02:02:55,415 --> 02:02:58,146
(laughter)

1596
02:02:58,146 --> 02:03:04,065
LIAM: My sister and I should lead the way. You
stick to Grog, will you, grandma?

1597
02:03:04,065 --> 02:03:07,003
CHRIS: I whack him.

1598
02:03:07,003 --> 02:03:08,345
(laughter)

1599
02:03:08,345 --> 02:03:09,418
MATT: (whack sound)

1600
02:03:09,418 --> 02:03:11,508
LIAM: Wait! I don't get to dodge?

1601
02:03:11,508 --> 02:03:18,979
MATT: No. Because, unexpected, she is swift, and
she is strong for being one-armed and of her age.

1602
02:03:18,979 --> 02:03:23,965
The sting hits the side of your shoulder before
you have a moment to really understand and your

1603
02:03:23,965 --> 02:03:30,163
diminutive form is thrown about three or four feet
back before you catch yourself.

1604
02:03:30,163 --> 02:03:33,266
TRAVIS: (laughter)

1605
02:03:33,266 --> 02:03:36,413
LIAM: I skitter off ahead of the group.

1606
02:03:36,413 --> 02:03:42,079
MARISHA: I cast Protection from Acid on Grog,
again.

1607
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:54,418
CHRIS: Now, if I don't survive, loves, I do have
some magic on me. So this staff has runes. You

1608
02:03:54,418 --> 02:04:01,426
can scratch them off and magical things will
appear! And this horn, if you blow it real loud,

1609
02:04:01,426 --> 02:04:05,409
it will let out a tremendous thunder that could
bring down the entire cave.

1610
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:08,255
SAM: I don't think you should be planning for your
own death!

1611
02:04:08,255 --> 02:04:09,610
LAURA: I'll take the horn.

1612
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:11,159
CHRIS: It might explode.

1613
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:12,536
SAM: It might <i>explode</i>?!

1614
02:04:12,536 --> 02:04:14,055
CHRIS: It's a little unstable.

1615
02:04:14,055 --> 02:04:16,307
LAURA: Scanlan, you should take the horn.

1616
02:04:16,307 --> 02:04:18,059
SAM: She's not dead yet!

1617
02:04:18,059 --> 02:04:19,858
LAURA: I'm saying when she dies. If she dies.

1618
02:04:19,858 --> 02:04:23,995
SAM: We're not going to divvy up her stuff! That's
bad luck!

1619
02:04:23,995 --> 02:04:26,898
LIAM: She's bequeathing it to you in her will.

1620
02:04:26,898 --> 02:04:31,688
CHRIS: And this pendant here, which looks like a
dragon tooth, it's a dragon tooth. And if you

1621
02:04:31,688 --> 02:04:34,329
wear it, it will close your wounds.

1622
02:04:34,329 --> 02:04:38,570
LAURA: Could I insight check her? I feel like she's
lying through her teeth.

1623
02:04:38,570 --> 02:04:40,438
(laughter)

1624
02:04:40,438 --> 02:04:41,973
MATT: Make an insight check.

1625
02:04:41,973 --> 02:04:44,758
SAM: Maybe we should just kill her now and take
the stuff.

1626
02:04:44,758 --> 02:04:46,112
LAURA: Natural 20.

1627
02:04:46,112 --> 02:04:48,903
MATT: Really? So, Chris?

1628
02:04:48,903 --> 02:04:50,646
CHRIS: I'm being super sincere.

1629
02:04:50,646 --> 02:04:54,315
LAURA: Oh. I really want all those things--

1630
02:04:54,315 --> 02:04:56,598
CHRIS: She honestly believes.

1631
02:04:56,598 --> 02:04:58,784
(laughter)

1632
02:04:58,784 --> 02:05:05,628
MARISHA: Shale, you seem almost like you're--

1633
02:05:05,628 --> 02:05:07,967
CHRIS: My hide armor ain't worth shit.

1634
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:15,255
MARISHA: As I was saying, you seem like you're
almost expecting to die, or you're looking forward

1635
02:05:15,255 --> 02:05:16,464
to it?

1636
02:05:16,464 --> 02:05:22,827
CHRIS: Well, I'm very old. And if I could die
fighting a dragon, well, there's no better way to

1637
02:05:22,827 --> 02:05:29,323
go. If I don't die, great! Wonderful!

1638
02:05:29,323 --> 02:05:34,502
MARISHA: All right. Just checking that we wouldn't
disappoint you if you don't die.

1639
02:05:34,502 --> 02:05:38,103
TRAVIS: Wait, just to be clear: if we kill the
dragon, are you going to say you killed the dragon

1640
02:05:38,103 --> 02:05:41,493
or would you say <i>I</i> killed the dragon? Who's
going to be the greatest goliath?

1641
02:05:41,493 --> 02:05:44,094
CHRIS: Why, you, of course.

1642
02:05:44,094 --> 02:05:45,320
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1643
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,306
CHRIS: I'm past my prime.

1644
02:05:47,306 --> 02:05:48,834
TRAVIS: We'll shake on it?

1645
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:50,548
CHRIS: I will shake on it.

1646
02:05:50,548 --> 02:05:55,017
MATT: Which is easy because you put out the proper
hand for the one arm she has.

1647
02:05:55,017 --> 02:05:59,694
CHRIS: You want to mess with her, put out your
other hand.

1648
02:05:59,694 --> 02:06:02,136
(laughter)

1649
02:06:02,136 --> 02:06:05,995
MARISHA: Shale, what type of magic do you wield,
exactly?

1650
02:06:05,995 --> 02:06:08,001
CHRIS: I wield this staff.

1651
02:06:08,001 --> 02:06:11,807
MARISHA: Okay. Very clear.

1652
02:06:11,807 --> 02:06:20,018
TALIESIN: This is going to be great! I'm on board
and committed to this. This is very exciting!

1653
02:06:20,018 --> 02:06:23,170
SAM: Thank you, Shale. Let's try to live.

1654
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:29,652
MARISHA: So remember, acid pools everywhere. Do we
have any type of cohesive plan, or just--

1655
02:06:29,652 --> 02:06:31,186
SAM: We're just going to go in.

1656
02:06:31,186 --> 02:06:32,629
TALIESIN: Just be very quiet.

1657
02:06:32,629 --> 02:06:39,284
LIAM: I'm already looking for traps, looking for
danger.

1658
02:06:39,284 --> 02:06:45,117
MATT: So you're coming up to the entrance.

1659
02:06:45,117 --> 02:06:51,144
LIAM: I'm not going to go in the entrance, but I'm
going to try to climb up and peer over the edge

1660
02:06:51,144 --> 02:06:53,102
and look as carefully as I can.

1661
02:06:53,102 --> 02:06:54,583
MATT: Go ahead and make another strength check.

1662
02:06:54,583 --> 02:06:58,445
LIAM: 17.

1663
02:06:58,445 --> 02:07:09,823
MATT: You manage to climb your way up to the
larger mouth of the cavern. It's about 40 feet

1664
02:07:09,823 --> 02:07:15,664
across at the very front of it. And about 50 feet
up. It's this large--

1665
02:07:15,664 --> 02:07:17,670
LIAM: 40 feet, 50 feet?

1666
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:22,883
MATT: Yeah. And the rest of you guys? Are you
pursuing?

1667
02:07:22,883 --> 02:07:24,548
SAM: I'm going to come.

1668
02:07:24,548 --> 02:07:26,406
MATT: Rest of you climbing along the mountain as
well?

1669
02:07:26,406 --> 02:07:27,760
SAM: Wait, is that the way in?

1670
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:33,418
TRAVIS: Is there anything you can do to make the
dragon visible with his invisibility? Set fire, or

1671
02:07:33,418 --> 02:07:34,666
your faeries?

1672
02:07:34,666 --> 02:07:39,907
MARISHA: I do have Faerie Fire. You combine the
two things that you said and it's fantastic.

1673
02:07:39,907 --> 02:07:48,406
TRAVIS: Totally meant to. Okay. I'm just climbing.
I'll follow them.

1674
02:07:48,406 --> 02:07:51,602
MATT: All right. Everyone who's climbing, I need
you to roll a strength check.

1675
02:07:51,602 --> 02:07:53,249
MARISHA: Wait! Who's climbing where?

1676
02:07:53,249 --> 02:08:00,146
MATT: There's no actual walkway to it.

1677
02:08:00,146 --> 02:08:03,567
LAURA: Does anybody want to ride the broom with
me?

1678
02:08:03,567 --> 02:08:07,427
TALIESIN: I'll ride the broom. I'm not a climber.

1679
02:08:07,427 --> 02:08:10,073
SAM: My Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, are those
attuned items?

1680
02:08:10,073 --> 02:08:11,645
MATT: I don't think they are, no.

1681
02:08:11,645 --> 02:08:15,029
SAM: I'll put on my Gloves of Swimming and
Climbing, which I got two years ago.

1682
02:08:15,029 --> 02:08:17,593
TRAVIS: 26.

1683
02:08:17,593 --> 02:08:20,123
MARISHA: 19.

1684
02:08:20,123 --> 02:08:22,702
SAM: I don't know what they do.

1685
02:08:22,702 --> 02:08:24,217
MATT: Advantage on the roll.

1686
02:08:24,217 --> 02:08:26,743
SAM: Oh, great! 16.

1687
02:08:26,743 --> 02:08:27,923
MATT: 16? Okay.

1688
02:08:27,923 --> 02:08:28,840
CHRIS: 18.

1689
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:30,006
MATT: 18. All right.

1690
02:08:30,006 --> 02:08:35,660
ASHLEY: 12.

1691
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:38,710
MATT: Okay. And you're floating up?

1692
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:39,877
LAURA: Yeah.

1693
02:08:39,877 --> 02:08:44,792
MATT: All of you begin to shimmy across the
surface. The wind is piercingly cold. The clouds

1694
02:08:44,792 --> 02:08:53,692
up here are dark and there isn't enough moisture
to rain, but there are flashes of some sort of

1695
02:08:53,692 --> 02:09:01,399
wild lightning storm that go off in the distance
in the roiling clouds. As you're making your way

1696
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:06,966
across, Pike, your foot skips across one of the
stones, it breaks and falls beneath you and you

1697
02:09:06,966 --> 02:09:11,734
almost lose yourself. Grog grabs you, and holds
you in place, and pulls you back up.

1698
02:09:11,734 --> 02:09:13,813
ASHLEY: Sorry, Grog.

1699
02:09:13,813 --> 02:09:15,244
TRAVIS: Nobody saw anything.

1700
02:09:15,244 --> 02:09:17,227
ASHLEY: I thought I would be stronger, but I'm
still not.

1701
02:09:17,227 --> 02:09:18,901
TRAVIS: You're a champ.

1702
02:09:18,901 --> 02:09:20,530
LAURA: Wait! Aren't you wearing the strength
gauntlets?

1703
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:25,524
ASHLEY: Yes, I am. That brought me to 12.

1704
02:09:25,524 --> 02:09:28,412
(laughter)

1705
02:09:28,412 --> 02:09:35,247
MATT: You all slowly make your way to the very
mouth of the cavern. You've been at this point, as

1706
02:09:35,247 --> 02:09:37,710
well. You wanted to go ahead and make an
investigation?

1707
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:38,964
LIAM: Scootching in, yeah.

1708
02:09:38,964 --> 02:09:44,144
MATT: All right, go for it.

1709
02:09:44,144 --> 02:09:48,611
LIAM: 24.

1710
02:09:48,611 --> 02:09:58,813
MATT: 24. Feeling around the exterior, there are
two rocks that are nearly identical, placed at

1711
02:09:58,813 --> 02:10:06,472
each side of the cavern entrance. Upon
approaching, their texture and their weathered

1712
02:10:06,472 --> 02:10:12,212
appearance is far younger than the rest of the
stone around them, and that catches your

1713
02:10:12,212 --> 02:10:13,858
attention.

1714
02:10:13,858 --> 02:10:20,326
LIAM: Do I need a further investigation check to
discern their nature?

1715
02:10:20,326 --> 02:10:25,702
MATT: The nature is some semblance of a magical
enchantment. This is a little beyond your

1716
02:10:25,702 --> 02:10:31,577
understanding unless you want to try and roughshod
it in the way you know how.

1717
02:10:31,577 --> 02:10:33,743
TRAVIS: Call me up to the front. We got this.

1718
02:10:33,743 --> 02:10:35,936
LIAM: Scanlan, do you want to grab that big...

1719
02:10:35,936 --> 02:10:38,828
SAM: Big what?

1720
02:10:38,828 --> 02:10:40,186
LIAM: Shale.

1721
02:10:40,186 --> 02:10:41,221
SAM: Oh, Shale.

1722
02:10:41,221 --> 02:10:42,396
LIAM: And yourself.

1723
02:10:42,396 --> 02:10:44,067
SAM: You got a trap up there, friend?

1724
02:10:44,067 --> 02:10:48,801
LIAM: Something. There's rocks up here that look a
little funky and I don't think they actually are rocks.

1725
02:10:48,801 --> 02:10:55,452
SAM: Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are
rocks. You could do something with rocks--

1726
02:10:55,452 --> 02:10:56,647
MARISHA: I love rocks!

1727
02:10:56,647 --> 02:10:58,922
SAM: Yeah, I know. Go up there with Shale. Shale's
a rock. Go.

1728
02:10:58,922 --> 02:11:03,756
MARISHA: Okay. What's happening? Where am I?

1729
02:11:03,756 --> 02:11:08,700
LIAM: Just come up a little bit slowly. There are a couple
of rocks up here that look a little funny to me.

1730
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:10,312
Don't step on me.

1731
02:11:10,312 --> 02:11:13,868
MARISHA: Oh right! You're so tiny right now. I
keep forgetting that.

1732
02:11:13,868 --> 02:11:16,934
CHRIS: You're very brave for someone so small!

1733
02:11:16,934 --> 02:11:23,087
MARISHA: Do you want me to put you in a little
pouch? Could be like a kangaroo?

1734
02:11:23,087 --> 02:11:24,902
SAM: We're going to die!

1735
02:11:24,902 --> 02:11:27,702
LIAM: Another time.

1736
02:11:27,702 --> 02:11:34,016
MATT: As Keyleth and Shale approach the threshold
that you're currently standing at, the rest of you

1737
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:39,701
are a little ways behind. He points out these two
stones. Go ahead and both of you guys make an

1738
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:44,605
arcana check. Shale, just from what you've seen in
the world.

1739
02:11:44,605 --> 02:11:46,754
CHRIS: Right. 13.

1740
02:11:46,754 --> 02:11:50,684
MARISHA: I think like, seven. Pretty sure my
arcana-- It's seven.

1741
02:11:50,684 --> 02:12:00,294
MATT: Oh, druids. You ascertain, Shale, just from
stumbling upon such constructions, this is--

1742
02:12:00,294 --> 02:12:08,937
There's some sort of magical essence to these
rocks. It's old magic, which is the only reason

1743
02:12:08,937 --> 02:12:12,515
you really recognize it. It's not the
hoity-toity-learned-in-a-tower magic all the

1744
02:12:12,515 --> 02:12:18,128
stupid people in the world tend to learn. This is
<i>old</i> magic. That's all you were able to pick from it.

1745
02:12:18,128 --> 02:12:19,577
LIAM: You know what it is?

1746
02:12:19,577 --> 02:12:20,650
CHRIS: Old magic.

1747
02:12:20,650 --> 02:12:22,861
(laughter)

1748
02:12:22,861 --> 02:12:25,019
LIAM: Hey, dirty bard, could you come up here?

1749
02:12:25,019 --> 02:12:28,282
SAM: Oi! I'm here now. Sorry. I thought that the
rock people could handle it.

1750
02:12:28,282 --> 02:12:30,452
LIAM: All hands on deck.

1751
02:12:30,452 --> 02:12:32,509
MARISHA: Scanlan, it's a very pretty rock--

1752
02:12:32,509 --> 02:12:33,735
SAM: 11 on arcana.

1753
02:12:33,735 --> 02:12:35,392
MATT: It's old magic.

1754
02:12:35,392 --> 02:12:36,813
SAM: This is old magic.

1755
02:12:36,813 --> 02:12:38,762
(laughter)

1756
02:12:38,762 --> 02:12:41,821
SAM: Not the kind you learn in
those hoity-toity towers.

1757
02:12:41,872 --> 02:12:44,040
ASHLEY: What's going on down there?

1758
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:45,849
(laughter)

1759
02:12:45,849 --> 02:12:47,867
SAM: Can't you just melt the rocks, Keyleth?

1760
02:12:47,867 --> 02:12:51,646
MARISHA: Pike, these are very attractive rocks.
What does it look like?

1761
02:12:51,646 --> 02:12:53,429
SAM: It looks like a rock. Melt it!

1762
02:12:53,429 --> 02:12:56,637
MARISHA: No. What does it look like? Is it like a
slate?

1763
02:12:56,637 --> 02:13:00,666
MATT: There are two stones about three to four
foot in diameter that are almost matching, that

1764
02:13:00,666 --> 02:13:03,762
are younger, less weathered than the rest of the
stonework around them.

1765
02:13:03,762 --> 02:13:07,688
CHRIS: Is there any way to circumvent them? Or are
they in opposite sides?

1766
02:13:07,688 --> 02:13:10,607
MATT: They're on opposite sides. You could
circumvent them, they're not in your path.

1767
02:13:10,607 --> 02:13:14,909
MARISHA: I can alter their shape. I can melt, I
can do something with them.

1768
02:13:14,909 --> 02:13:18,159
LIAM: No. Just, they're not real. A few steps
back. Trickfoot's--

1769
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,839
MARISHA: What do you mean, they're not real?

1770
02:13:19,839 --> 02:13:21,295
ASHLEY: I walk up.

1771
02:13:21,295 --> 02:13:22,876
LAURA: Can you dispel that shit?

1772
02:13:22,876 --> 02:13:24,617
ASHLEY: Yes. Is it magic--?

1773
02:13:24,617 --> 02:13:27,592
SAM and CHRIS: It's old magic.

1774
02:13:27,592 --> 02:13:29,516
(laughter)

1775
02:13:29,516 --> 02:13:31,917
TALIESIN: Not the kind of magic you learn in ivory
towers.

1776
02:13:31,917 --> 02:13:34,452
CHRIS: Older-than-me magic.

1777
02:13:34,452 --> 02:13:37,178
ASHLEY: That's just old.

1778
02:13:37,178 --> 02:13:41,093
(laughter)

1779
02:13:41,093 --> 02:13:47,243
SAM: It sort of has that old smell to it.

1780
02:13:47,243 --> 02:13:50,815
LIAM: Hey, fuck it. I'm going to take a good, hard
look at this rock.

1781
02:13:50,815 --> 02:13:54,739
MARISHA: Hang on. We might be able to circumvent
it. Right? Can we go around it?

1782
02:13:54,739 --> 02:13:58,430
ASHLEY: I have Dispel Magic, but I wonder if we
should use it.

1783
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:01,959
SAM: Dispel that magic!

1784
02:14:01,959 --> 02:14:07,904
ASHLEY: But that's one of my last spells!

1785
02:14:07,904 --> 02:14:10,520
LAURA: Well then, let's avoid them. Let's just go
around them.

1786
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:15,261
MARISHA: Is there room on either side of them?

1787
02:14:15,261 --> 02:14:20,429
MATT: They are embedded in the sides of the wall.
So you could pass through them, over them, however

1788
02:14:20,429 --> 02:14:22,325
else you want to try and circumvent them.

1789
02:14:22,325 --> 02:14:29,202
MARISHA: How about this? I'm going to cast
Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path

1790
02:14:29,202 --> 02:14:33,238
around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little
recess?

1791
02:14:33,238 --> 02:14:34,532
MATT: You can, yeah.

1792
02:14:34,532 --> 02:14:39,305
SAM: See? Rocks! I told you!

1793
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:40,601
MARISHA: Rocks!

1794
02:14:40,601 --> 02:14:45,444
TALIESIN: Old rocks. Not the kind of rocks one
finds in ivory towers.

1795
02:14:45,444 --> 02:14:55,627
MATT: Yes. Your 4th-level Stoneshape. You cause a
portion of the rock wall at the side of the cavern

1796
02:14:55,627 --> 02:15:01,482
to actually forge itself into a tunnel,
circumventing the exterior rock on the left.

1797
02:15:01,482 --> 02:15:04,981
LAURA: Could you just do that the entire way
into the cavern?

1798
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:08,670
MARISHA: I can do it two more times. All the way
into the cavern.

1799
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:13,199
SAM: Okay. Let's go through the new hole.

1800
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:20,936
LIAM: I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to keep
doing the same. Come on, you big giant dummy.

1801
02:15:21,014 --> 02:15:25,205
LAURA: I'm on a broom, do you want to ride it with
me? Just kidding-- Percy's already on.

1802
02:15:25,205 --> 02:15:28,787
LIAM: I'll stealth ahead and look around.

1803
02:15:28,787 --> 02:15:31,741
MATT: Okay. So roll your stealth check.

1804
02:15:31,741 --> 02:15:33,726
LIAM: A new stealth check?

1805
02:15:33,726 --> 02:15:36,269
MATT: Yeah, because you've come out of stealth and
back into it.

1806
02:15:36,269 --> 02:15:47,357
LIAM: Okay. Well, I still have Pass Without a
Trace, right? So I'm at 40.

1807
02:15:47,357 --> 02:15:51,799
MATT: So you make your way into the next portion.
You're actually able to start seeing--

1808
02:15:51,799 --> 02:15:54,316
TALIESIN: Whoa! Slowly!

1809
02:15:54,316 --> 02:15:57,989
LIAM: You people don't see shit.

1810
02:15:57,989 --> 02:15:59,834
LAURA: Oh, that's acid!

1811
02:15:59,834 --> 02:16:08,871
MATT: --in a raised platform, in a pool of
somewhat pungent-smelling liquid as you get even

1812
02:16:08,871 --> 02:16:17,416
remotely close to it, the fume causes your sinuses
to open and burn and tingle.

1813
02:16:17,416 --> 02:16:19,260
LIAM: They barely get in.

1814
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,700
LAURA: Yeah. (cutesy voice) It's too small...

1815
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:27,671
LIAM: I'm just going to hold still for a second
and listen. Do I hear anything?

1816
02:16:27,671 --> 02:16:30,237
MATT: Make a perception check.

1817
02:16:30,237 --> 02:16:35,628
LIAM: 27.

1818
02:16:35,628 --> 02:16:44,007
MATT: 27? You hear a very faint breathing.
Breathing that is trying to stay quiet, but by the

1819
02:16:44,007 --> 02:16:51,496
sheer immensity of the beast creating the sound,
you can pick up the very subtle movement of air through

1820
02:16:51,496 --> 02:16:59,946
the normally still cavern. (faint breathing
noise)

1821
02:16:59,946 --> 02:17:09,525
LIAM: I'm going to quietly take-- I'm going to back
up 15 feet. (whispers) For everyone who's next to

1822
02:17:09,525 --> 02:17:16,938
me, and for those who are not, it is in here. It
is awake. And it is waiting for us.

1823
02:17:16,938 --> 02:17:18,499
CHRIS: What did he say?

1824
02:17:18,499 --> 02:17:22,836
LIAM: Pike. Don't. Move.

1825
02:17:22,836 --> 02:17:24,896
ASHLEY: I'm so still.

1826
02:17:24,896 --> 02:17:30,915
LIAM: Just coming running to go when
shit goes down, but don't move.

1827
02:17:30,915 --> 02:17:33,274
TRAVIS: (whispers) What about putting her on my
back?

1828
02:17:33,274 --> 02:17:39,659
LIAM: Grog, don't move yet. I'm going to go back
in for another look.

1829
02:17:39,659 --> 02:17:42,352
SAM: Alone?

1830
02:17:42,352 --> 02:17:46,276
MATT: Stealth.

1831
02:17:46,276 --> 02:17:53,649
LIAM: Well, yeah. I'm not a barbarian. I'm going
to go along the edge closest to you and move back to

1832
02:17:53,649 --> 02:17:55,448
where I stopped to listen.

1833
02:17:55,448 --> 02:17:58,318
MATT: About there would be in tandem with where
you were.

1834
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:02,314
LIAM: And I'm going to go another ten feet in,
looking.

1835
02:18:02,314 --> 02:18:12,357
MATT: As he curls back, the cavern is revealed
further. The pool does come to an end. There are

1836
02:18:12,357 --> 02:18:18,466
pieces of stone that jut out of the floor. You do
see now, scattered across the grounds,

1837
02:18:18,466 --> 02:18:25,734
occasionally a bit of shine, a little coin-- gold,
silver-- elements of wealth that've been dragged

1838
02:18:25,734 --> 02:18:30,891
deeper into the cavern that have left behind them
some remnants in the process of being carried and

1839
02:18:30,891 --> 02:18:32,258
carted in.

1840
02:18:32,258 --> 02:18:35,042
LIAM: If I look back, can I see my sister from
where I am?

1841
02:18:35,042 --> 02:18:40,520
MATT: Actually, no. Because she's really well
stealthed.

1842
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:44,316
LIAM: She can't see me either?

1843
02:18:44,316 --> 02:18:47,400
MATT: No. You guys have no visual perspective on
each other. You've all stealthed away from your

1844
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:48,913
own party.

1845
02:18:48,913 --> 02:18:53,089
LIAM: Okay. There's a pool of acid right by me,
yeah?

1846
02:18:53,089 --> 02:18:54,422
MATT: Yes, there is.

1847
02:18:54,422 --> 02:18:56,162
LIAM: Is there dim light here?

1848
02:18:56,162 --> 02:19:01,408
MATT: The light grows dim at about this point,
then it becomes darkness at about this point.

1849
02:19:01,408 --> 02:19:05,271
LIAM: But you said that I can see a pool 
of liquid, right?

1850
02:19:05,271 --> 02:19:09,194
MATT: Yeah. What little bit of daylight that's coming
in the cavern entrance would be over here.

1851
02:19:09,194 --> 02:19:12,411
LIAM: Is the surface of the liquid flat as far as
I can see?

1852
02:19:12,411 --> 02:19:16,861
MATT: What you can see, it is flat. There's a
little, very faint breeze that occasionally comes

1853
02:19:16,861 --> 02:19:20,900
through so there's a slight disturbance here and
there, but no specific visual disturbance.

1854
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:28,053
LIAM: How far along that pool can I actually see?
If you had to do a cut-off point?

1855
02:19:28,053 --> 02:19:32,745
MATT: Because of your darkvision, being an elf,
you can see pretty much to the edge of this.

1856
02:19:32,745 --> 02:19:37,088
LIAM: Okay. So it doesn't look like there's a big
divot?

1857
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:39,064
MATT: There's no displacement of the pool.

1858
02:19:39,064 --> 02:19:50,323
LIAM: I'm going to creep along the wall towards
that pillar. I'll stop in that corner, and then move

1859
02:19:50,323 --> 02:19:55,619
towards you one. Does it give me a better
view?

1860
02:19:55,619 --> 02:19:59,155
MATT: A little bit of a further view, just the
cavern continues in that direction.

1861
02:19:59,155 --> 02:20:01,235
LIAM: Can I still hear the same thing?

1862
02:20:01,235 --> 02:20:12,872
MATT: You can hear it very faintly. You can't
quite make out the source. There is something

1863
02:20:12,872 --> 02:20:18,492
about the room and the air that's travelling through
here. The sound itself, you're just barely catching it and

1864
02:20:18,492 --> 02:20:23,008
it seems to be reverberating to a small
extent off the walls of this cavern, which carry

1865
02:20:23,008 --> 02:20:24,567
sound very well.

1866
02:20:24,567 --> 02:20:26,036
LIAM: What do I see if I look up?

1867
02:20:26,036 --> 02:20:34,159
MATT: You look up, you see about 60 feet, 70 feet
in the air, just past where your vision begins to

1868
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:40,244
fade-- The only reason you know there's a ceiling
there is because there are a few points of rock,

1869
02:20:40,244 --> 02:20:46,735
the top of the cavern does descend into
stalactites-- it is?

1870
02:20:46,735 --> 02:20:48,034
CHRIS: Stalactites, yes.

1871
02:20:48,034 --> 02:20:49,364
MATT: Yes. Thank you.

1872
02:20:49,364 --> 02:20:53,851
LIAM: There's no large outcrops that this thing
could be sitting on?

1873
02:20:53,851 --> 02:20:59,785
MATT: Not from what you can see, no. The mineral
build-up of the inside of this cavern leads to a

1874
02:20:59,785 --> 02:21:04,840
direct, slick surface in the walls. The minerals
rounded off most of the stone.

1875
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:20,579
LIAM: I'm going to backtrack. I'm going to find my
sister. And I'm still very little. It's at the

1876
02:21:20,579 --> 02:21:27,118
back of that cavern. It's not in the pool of acid
that's near the front, and it's not just past

1877
02:21:27,118 --> 02:21:35,018
that. It keeps going back. So if we're going to do
this, and we're all just going to throw ourselves

1878
02:21:35,018 --> 02:21:43,302
into it, and let the chips fall where they may.
The best thing that I can do right now is take it

1879
02:21:43,302 --> 02:21:47,528
unawares, hurt it for as much as I can--

1880
02:21:47,528 --> 02:21:49,356
LAURA: Are you kidding me right now?

1881
02:21:49,356 --> 02:21:53,820
LIAM: I'm not kidding you! I want to kill this
thing. This is the first stepping stone, and I

1882
02:21:53,820 --> 02:22:05,427
could potentially take it out. Catch it unawares
before it vomits on all of you. I want to do it,

1883
02:22:05,427 --> 02:22:16,622
and I just want to know that you're going to come
in after and finish it if you need to. I told you

1884
02:22:16,622 --> 02:22:19,130
what I want to do.

1885
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:36,062
LAURA: All right. I will give you a minute head
start to get across the room. After that, I'm

1886
02:22:36,062 --> 02:22:38,926
coming in. So you better hope you're at the dragon
by that point.

1887
02:22:38,926 --> 02:22:50,540
LIAM: I start off. Come back and tug. (whispers)
Jenga.

1888
02:22:50,540 --> 02:22:54,596
MATT: Make a stealth check.

1889
02:22:54,596 --> 02:22:56,162
LIAM: I'm going back to where I was.

1890
02:22:56,162 --> 02:23:04,825
MATT: All right. What is it?

1891
02:23:04,825 --> 02:23:07,693
LIAM: With Pass Without a Trace? 43.

1892
02:23:07,693 --> 02:23:14,309
MATT: All right. So you're back where you were.
The rest of you, what are you doing?

1893
02:23:14,309 --> 02:23:16,811
CHRIS: Well, he's a mad little one, isn't he?

1894
02:23:16,811 --> 02:23:19,822
SAM: He's not usually little.

1895
02:23:19,822 --> 02:23:23,232
(laughter)

1896
02:23:23,232 --> 02:23:27,692
LIAM: I'd like to go around the column, and around
the edge of the wall.

1897
02:23:27,692 --> 02:23:43,486
MATT: This opens up slightly more, and you get to
see a portion of the mineral growth-- a lot of the

1898
02:23:43,486 --> 02:23:48,417
moisture that has coalesced into the ceiling has
come into a central point, and over time, it just

1899
02:23:48,417 --> 02:23:54,304
built up these central columns of rock and
natural materials. A few pools have gathered

1900
02:23:54,304 --> 02:24:00,846
towards the base. You see portions of the ground
where elements of the acrid liquid that filled the

1901
02:24:00,846 --> 02:24:07,489
pool over here just dripped in. Whether they began
this way or turned by the dragon's presence, you

1902
02:24:07,489 --> 02:24:12,142
are unaware. But that's as far as you can see.

1903
02:24:12,194 --> 02:24:21,800
LIAM: Further along the wall, that little rock--
yeah. And just a little bit past it. And then

1904
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:24,245
closer to you.

1905
02:24:24,245 --> 02:24:36,206
MATT: At this point, you can make out that
additional pool of acid, the far back corner and a

1906
02:24:36,206 --> 02:24:44,146
risen platform, you see the portion of the
cavernous stone beginning to mass into a higher

1907
02:24:44,232 --> 02:24:46,256
level towards the far back corner.

1908
02:24:46,256 --> 02:24:48,231
LIAM: I listen.

1909
02:24:48,231 --> 02:24:50,842
MATT: Roll a perception check.

1910
02:24:50,842 --> 02:24:52,776
LIAM: 20.

1911
02:24:52,776 --> 02:25:05,122
MATT: 20. You listen in... Silence. Stillness. The
very faint whisper of wind far behind you.

1912
02:25:05,122 --> 02:25:20,341
LIAM: Around the entire wall. Further, past that
pool of acid, even. Further corner.

1913
02:25:20,341 --> 02:25:22,739
SAM: Has it been a minute yet?

1914
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:24,338
TALIESIN: About half a minute.

1915
02:25:24,338 --> 02:25:30,770
MATT: As you come around this corner, being as
careful as you can, looking around you-- (impact).

1916
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:33,389
Your shoulder hits something.

1917
02:25:33,389 --> 02:25:35,356
LIAM: Stab.

1918
02:25:35,356 --> 02:25:38,143
MATT: Roll initiative.

1919
02:25:38,143 --> 02:25:50,768
LIAM: I'm going to call it. I mean, mostly I'm 14.
I'll take it, that means 19.

1920
02:25:50,768 --> 02:26:00,629
MATT: All right. So you have just bumped into the
currently invisible form of Umbrasyl lying in wait

1921
02:26:00,629 --> 02:26:09,139
in the far corner of the cavern. That would be a
20 initiative from Umbrasyl.

1922
02:26:09,139 --> 02:26:11,079
LIAM: Fuck. You.

1923
02:26:11,079 --> 02:26:12,824
LAURA: How long has it been?

1924
02:26:12,824 --> 02:26:16,634
MATT: At this travel pace, it's been about 
45 seconds or so.

1925
02:26:16,634 --> 02:26:23,671
LIAM: Jenga!

1926
02:26:23,671 --> 02:26:25,127
(laughter)

1927
02:26:25,127 --> 02:26:31,836
MATT: You hear "Jenga!" out of the back of the
earring as, let's say the rest of you guys are

1928
02:26:31,836 --> 02:26:32,771
right here.

1929
02:26:32,771 --> 02:26:36,860
LAURA: I still want to be stealthed on the broom but
I take off into the cavern.

1930
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,460
MATT: I assume Trinket is in your necklace?

1931
02:26:38,460 --> 02:26:39,703
LAURA: Yes.

1932
02:26:39,703 --> 02:26:43,279
MATT: All right. This is going to be you, with
your big stick.

1933
02:26:43,279 --> 02:26:44,659
CHRIS: Awesome!

1934
02:26:44,659 --> 02:26:53,054
MATT: Chilling here with the rest of the party. So, at
the top of this round, you just hear the growl,

1935
02:26:53,054 --> 02:27:01,441
the snarl. (snarling) You say "Jenga," blades
already at the ready, you go to stab as (swooshing)

1936
02:27:01,441 --> 02:27:06,654
all of a sudden, you hear this swishing
sound of air being cut through at such a speed

1937
02:27:06,654 --> 02:27:11,530
that it causes a high-pitched whine. Claws and
teeth come spinning out of nowhere. You can't even see

1938
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:15,431
your attacker but you feel the brunt force behind
each of these blows.

1939
02:27:15,431 --> 02:27:18,016
LIAM: Because it's invisible, is there no Uncanny
Dodge?

1940
02:27:18,084 --> 02:27:25,631
MATT: No, you've still got Uncanny Dodge on one of
the attacks. Just from your roguish instincts.

1941
02:27:25,631 --> 02:27:27,348
LIAM: Displacer Cloak.

1942
02:27:27,348 --> 02:27:34,769
MATT: Correct. It gets disadvantage on the first
attack, which is going to be a bite. That's a natural

1943
02:27:34,769 --> 02:27:41,371
19, and a two! With the two, that brings it to a
17.

1944
02:27:41,371 --> 02:27:43,289
LIAM: Nope.

1945
02:27:43,289 --> 02:27:51,462
MATT: So with that, you (whoosh) see for a split
second, the ripple of teeth snap before you,

1946
02:27:51,462 --> 02:27:58,259
missing your face by mere inches before they
disappear once again. Two more claws (whoosh)

1947
02:27:58,259 --> 02:28:04,616
towards you. The first one, that's a 19 again and a
seven. That's going to be a 22.

1948
02:28:04,616 --> 02:28:08,179
LIAM: Just hits. Uncanny Dodge.

1949
02:28:08,179 --> 02:28:11,075
MATT: Oh, your AC would be 20 because you're not
hasted right now.

1950
02:28:11,075 --> 02:28:12,821
LIAM: Oh, you're right. Thank you.

1951
02:28:12,821 --> 02:28:22,596
MATT: So that would put you at 18 points of
slashing damage.

1952
02:28:22,596 --> 02:28:24,418
LIAM: Halved to nine.

1953
02:28:24,418 --> 02:28:29,014
MATT: Halved to nine. Also your displacement is
gone from your cloak.

1954
02:28:29,014 --> 02:28:30,306
LIAM: For this round?

1955
02:28:30,306 --> 02:28:37,727
MATT: Yeah. For the next attack, it's a 19. Misses
you? 20? Yeah. The second claw swings

1956
02:28:37,727 --> 02:28:41,495
through, at this point, from the pain of the
first strike of the dragon claw hits you, you back

1957
02:28:41,495 --> 02:28:46,138
up to the very edge of the cave and duck out of
the way as you hear the wind change. As you do,

1958
02:28:46,138 --> 02:28:51,033
you hear the stone crash behind you as the claw
misses you, slamming instead to the side of the

1959
02:28:51,033 --> 02:28:55,967
cavern wall. It's now your turn.

1960
02:28:55,967 --> 02:29:00,551
LIAM: I'm going to stay right here. I'm going to
hold my turn until one of my friends is on top of

1961
02:29:00,551 --> 02:29:02,436
this thing and then I'm going to stab it.

1962
02:29:02,436 --> 02:29:05,204
MATT: You hold your action until one of your
friends is on it and then you move? Okay.

1963
02:29:05,204 --> 02:29:09,719
LIAM: Not <i>on</i> it, but against it, attacking it.
Melee attack.

1964
02:29:09,719 --> 02:29:14,699
MATT: So that ends your turn. Everyone else, I
need you to roll initiative.

1965
02:29:14,699 --> 02:29:16,368
MARISHA: Oh, shitballs!

1966
02:29:16,368 --> 02:29:20,096
TRAVIS: Balls of shit.

1967
02:29:20,096 --> 02:29:23,959
MARISHA: Whoa! Percy!

1968
02:29:23,959 --> 02:29:25,737
MATT: Your initiative from before was--?

1969
02:29:25,737 --> 02:29:27,006
LIAM: 19.

1970
02:29:27,006 --> 02:29:30,358
MATT: So 25 to 20?

1971
02:29:30,358 --> 02:29:31,421
LAURA: 22.

1972
02:29:31,421 --> 02:29:32,591
TALIESIN: 30.

1973
02:29:32,591 --> 02:29:34,305
MARISHA: He rolled a natural 20!

1974
02:29:34,305 --> 02:29:35,651
MATT: (laughs) Percy!

1975
02:29:35,651 --> 02:29:37,552
LAURA: Are you on the broom with me still?

1976
02:29:37,552 --> 02:29:40,402
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm hanging so I can drop.

1977
02:29:40,402 --> 02:29:48,638
MATT: So that's 20. 20 to 15?

1978
02:29:48,638 --> 02:29:49,919
CHRIS: Another 19.

1979
02:29:49,919 --> 02:29:53,167
MATT: Another 19! Nice!

1980
02:29:53,167 --> 02:29:54,654
MARISHA: 17.

1981
02:29:54,654 --> 02:29:56,637
ASHLEY: 18.

1982
02:29:56,637 --> 02:29:58,542
LAURA: Nice, Pike!

1983
02:29:58,542 --> 02:30:05,270
MATT: So Pike then Keyleth.

1984
02:30:05,270 --> 02:30:08,547
TRAVIS: A mere 16.

1985
02:30:08,547 --> 02:30:10,391
MATT: Scanlan, what did you get?

1986
02:30:10,391 --> 02:30:14,725
(laughter)

1987
02:30:14,725 --> 02:30:19,249
SAM: I got an eight.

1988
02:30:19,249 --> 02:30:21,424
MATT: And Scanlan taking the rear.

1989
02:30:21,424 --> 02:30:29,216
As you guys hear the crashing of stone at
the far corner accompanied directly after the

1990
02:30:29,216 --> 02:30:36,818
whisper of Vax's cry-out of "Jenga!" you already
know shit is going down. Percy, you're

1991
02:30:36,818 --> 02:30:39,411
up first. Clutching the bottom of the broom that
has not moved yet, what are you doing with your turn?

1992
02:30:39,411 --> 02:30:46,096
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop down. I'll let go of
the broom. I'm going to just fire blind where I

1993
02:30:46,096 --> 02:30:47,786
heard the noise coming from.

1994
02:30:47,786 --> 02:30:53,249
MATT: So you're firing in this direction?

1995
02:30:53,249 --> 02:30:54,516
TALIESIN: Yep.

1996
02:30:54,516 --> 02:30:56,474
MATT: Go ahead and make your attacks at
disadvantage.

1997
02:30:56,474 --> 02:31:06,755
TALIESIN: Disadvantage. That is a 25.

1998
02:31:06,755 --> 02:31:12,988
MATT: Due to the massive size of this currently
still invisible entity, you do manage to catch an

1999
02:31:12,988 --> 02:31:16,092
odd bullet towards its form. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2000
02:31:16,092 --> 02:31:24,976
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Ten points of piercing
damage.

2001
02:31:24,976 --> 02:31:32,425
MATT: All righty. (gunshot sound) Gun goes off,
echoes, little bit of dust comes loose from the

2002
02:31:32,425 --> 02:31:35,325
ceiling and falls down as you ready for your next
shot.

2003
02:31:35,325 --> 02:31:43,808
TALIESIN: I'll take the next shot. Forget it.
Might as well go for it.

2004
02:31:43,808 --> 02:31:45,930
MATT: At disadvantage.

2005
02:31:45,930 --> 02:31:49,187
TALIESIN: That's 20.

2006
02:31:49,187 --> 02:31:53,793
MATT: This time, the shot goes the second time
(gunshot sound) poofs against some stone in the

2007
02:31:53,793 --> 02:31:55,568
distance, not hitting its mark.

2008
02:31:55,568 --> 02:31:59,331
TALIESIN: Third shot for the run. Fucking--

2009
02:31:59,331 --> 02:32:01,350
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2010
02:32:01,350 --> 02:32:02,931
TALIESIN: And a one.

2011
02:32:02,931 --> 02:32:11,190
MATT: So with that, the third shot (click),
nothing emerges from it. And you look down. It's

2012
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:13,007
not been a day for Percy.

2013
02:32:13,007 --> 02:32:19,654
TALIESIN: It's not been a day for Percy. I'm going
to start making a dash into the corner there, up

2014
02:32:19,654 --> 02:32:20,981
in the--

2015
02:32:20,981 --> 02:32:22,394
MATT: Not a dash, because you used your action.

2016
02:32:22,394 --> 02:32:24,308
TALIESIN: No, I'll make a run. Yes, to the wall.

2017
02:32:24,308 --> 02:32:25,757
CHRIS: Is that some sort of weapon?

2018
02:32:25,757 --> 02:32:28,187
TALIESIN: Not anymore, it's not!

2019
02:32:28,187 --> 02:32:34,291
MATT: As she takes her one good arm and cleans
out, missing an eye now or maybe missing an

2020
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:38,194
eardrum. (laughs) That's going to end your turn,
Percy?

2021
02:32:38,194 --> 02:32:45,799
TALIESIN: Oh god, this is a terrible idea. I'm
going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind

2022
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:47,337
me. If that's okay?

2023
02:32:47,337 --> 02:32:48,393
MATT: This one, right here?

2024
02:32:48,393 --> 02:32:49,991
TALIESIN: Yeah. I've got to fix this.

2025
02:32:49,991 --> 02:32:53,535
MATT: That brings us to Vex.

2026
02:32:53,535 --> 02:33:08,754
LAURA: Yes. I'm going to fly on my broom as far in
as I can. And land, maybe on that? And just shoot

2027
02:33:08,754 --> 02:33:15,950
arrows towards where I heard it coming from. I
feel like I have one blazing bowstring left,

2028
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:18,462
because I used it once in the last battle,
right?

2029
02:33:18,462 --> 02:33:19,633
MATT: You would still have one more use, yes.

2030
02:33:19,633 --> 02:33:22,313
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to try it through the
blazing bowstring.

2031
02:33:22,313 --> 02:33:26,467
MATT: Go for it. At disadvantage on this shot, as
you cannot see the actual entity. You're firing

2032
02:33:26,467 --> 02:33:28,051
into the darkness.

2033
02:33:28,051 --> 02:33:31,667
LIAM: Natural 20. And another natural 20?

2034
02:33:31,667 --> 02:33:39,589
LAURA: Piece of shit! 19.

2035
02:33:39,589 --> 02:33:43,213
MATT: 19? Nope!

2036
02:33:43,213 --> 02:33:45,317
ASHLEY: Oh! War God's Blessing.

2037
02:33:45,317 --> 02:33:51,161
MATT: Okay. As your reaction, you guide her--
though the blazing bowstring was unfortunately

2038
02:33:51,161 --> 02:33:52,564
used on the first attack that missed.

2039
02:33:52,564 --> 02:33:59,993
LAURA: That was just for the first attack. I rolled
twice for disadvantage. So that's the blazing

2040
02:33:59,993 --> 02:34:01,145
bowstring.

2041
02:34:01,145 --> 02:34:08,130
MATT: Okay, I misunderstood. As you go for the attack,
you see the actual arrow bursting into flames, not

2042
02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:12,280
quite sure where to fire. You're about to pull
back and aim and Pike shouts to you, putting her

2043
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:16,783
hand out. Suddenly, a spark of divine energy hits
the front of the bow and corrects its course,

2044
02:34:16,783 --> 02:34:23,545
beyond your actual arm motion, and you release,
based on the faith you have in Pike. The arrow

2045
02:34:23,545 --> 02:34:28,404
strikes true. You hear a slight growling roar
from the distance. Go ahead and roll damage.

2046
02:34:28,404 --> 02:34:30,173
PIKE: Strike good and true!

2047
02:34:30,173 --> 02:34:42,613
LAURA: 22.

2048
02:34:42,683 --> 02:34:44,569
MATT: 22, nice.

2049
02:34:44,569 --> 02:34:53,035
LAURA: On my first attack! If I release Trinket,
is that an attack? Or is that a bonus action?

2050
02:34:53,035 --> 02:34:55,729
MATT: It would say in the actual item.

2051
02:34:55,729 --> 02:35:10,524
LAURA: Raven's Slumber. You can make a melee
attack. No, that's not it. Bonus action to release

2052
02:35:10,524 --> 02:35:20,702
it! I'm going to use a bonus action, and I'm going to shout
at Trinket to go run towards my brother. I'm going to

2053
02:35:20,796 --> 02:35:21,990
attack it again.

2054
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:26,577
MATT: You send Trinket out, ten feet in front.
Trinket is going to go-- it's 40 feet, right?

2055
02:35:26,577 --> 02:35:28,708
LAURA: Yeah.

2056
02:35:28,708 --> 02:35:34,535
MATT: Trinket rushes forward there. You go make
your second attack. Trinket goes: (angry bear

2057
02:35:34,535 --> 02:35:41,295
growls) big old grizzly bear charging into the
darkness, growling echoing through the cavern.

2058
02:35:41,295 --> 02:35:49,575
LAURA: Oh, disadvantage. 27.

2059
02:35:49,575 --> 02:35:57,383
MATT: 27 with disadvantage still hits, yeah. Your
honed senses to dragon-kind, you can remember the

2060
02:35:57,383 --> 02:36:02,081
mass, and general size and placement based on the
sound you heard from the growls from the first

2061
02:36:02,081 --> 02:36:06,206
impact you made. You just strike again in the
same direction, hitting true. Roll damage.

2062
02:36:06,206 --> 02:36:07,393
LAURA: 12.

2063
02:36:07,393 --> 02:36:08,357
MATT: 12 damage.

2064
02:36:08,357 --> 02:36:10,065
LAURA: Is that sneak attack because my brother is
next to it?

2065
02:36:10,065 --> 02:36:14,467
LIAM: It's occupied with me.

2066
02:36:14,467 --> 02:36:19,557
LAURA: So I would have gotten the sneak attack on both
those? Or just on the one?

2067
02:36:19,557 --> 02:36:23,880
MATT: Just on the one. Yes, I'll allow it because
he is currently threatening it. It was a lucky

2068
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:25,533
shot. It was a very lucky shot.

2069
02:36:25,533 --> 02:36:27,078
LAURA: Additional five.

2070
02:36:27,078 --> 02:36:29,461
MATT: All righty, good to know. So, total of--

2071
02:36:29,461 --> 02:36:30,614
LAURA: 17.

2072
02:36:30,614 --> 02:36:35,568
MATT: 17. Thank you. Both arrows done. Trinket
rushing in--

2073
02:36:35,568 --> 02:36:41,052
LAURA: I want to duck down if I can, behind that
whatever that I'm standing on now.

2074
02:36:41,052 --> 02:36:46,523
MATT: You can duck down, but you've used most of your
action in this turn to sail in, and you can't hide

2075
02:36:46,612 --> 02:36:47,603
per se.

2076
02:36:47,603 --> 02:36:51,756
LAURA: Okay. I just want to duck behind it so I'm
away from anything flying at me.

2077
02:36:51,756 --> 02:37:02,623
MATT: Makes sense. All right, so we're now at 20. At
this point in time, the roar hits (roaring),

2078
02:37:02,623 --> 02:37:10,325
echoing through the cavern. As the echoing begins
to vibrate and the noise doesn't subside, the low

2079
02:37:10,325 --> 02:37:21,031
hum turns instead to a (buzzing) as seemingly out
of the pool of acid, a cloud of biting, stinging

2080
02:37:21,031 --> 02:37:22,925
insects emerges.

2081
02:37:22,925 --> 02:37:24,882
MARISHA: He did Insect Plague.

2082
02:37:24,882 --> 02:37:33,841
MATT: (buzzing) Floats in this direction, getting
the three of you right there. I'll say for the

2083
02:37:33,841 --> 02:37:41,492
purposes of this that you guys are both in that
radius. Anyway, this cloud of insects moves in

2084
02:37:41,492 --> 02:37:50,390
to-- I need Percy, Shale, and Vex to make
constitution saving throws.

2085
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:53,605
CHRIS: Aw, eight!

2086
02:37:53,605 --> 02:37:56,936
TALIESIN: 21.

2087
02:37:56,936 --> 02:38:00,181
LAURA: 18.

2088
02:38:00,269 --> 02:38:09,974
MATT: 18. So you guys both, being dexterous and
quick, but also able to maintain your form-- the

2089
02:38:09,974 --> 02:38:13,827
best you can at this turn-- manage to pull out of
the way without too much impact. However, poor

2090
02:38:13,827 --> 02:38:16,785
Shale is surrounded by the insects.

2091
02:38:16,785 --> 02:38:19,584
CHRIS: Slow and half-deaf.

2092
02:38:19,657 --> 02:38:24,058
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage as the
insects riddle you with bites and stings.

2093
02:38:24,058 --> 02:38:32,033
SAM: Shale, do you have any gold teeth or hidden
savings accounts that we should also know about?

2094
02:38:32,033 --> 02:38:35,169
LAURA: She can't hear you, she's deaf.

2095
02:38:35,169 --> 02:38:48,868
MATT: At this point now, you hear a few footfalls,
Vax. You see a splash in the pool next to you that

2096
02:38:48,868 --> 02:38:53,195
almost scatters against you, bits of it hitting
the edge of your armor, but the armor absorbs the

2097
02:38:53,195 --> 02:38:59,823
blow, being attuned towards acid resistance. A few
other steps as it begins to walk away. I'll allow

2098
02:38:59,823 --> 02:39:03,333
you to make an attack of opportunity with
disadvantage--

2099
02:39:03,333 --> 02:39:06,652
LIAM: With disadvantage, but-- Yeah, okay.

2100
02:39:06,652 --> 02:39:11,070
MATT: Yeah, as you sense that it's moving away,
you wildly swing out in front of you.

2101
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:16,350
LIAM: Nah. 15.

2102
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:28,646
MATT: 15. Whiffs on air. However, (heavy
footfalls) moving forward. A voice comes roaring

2103
02:39:28,732 --> 02:39:42,688
out into the area, "You dare soil my home after
what you've done below?! I will watch you dissolve

2104
02:39:42,688 --> 02:39:59,273
"before I suck down your liquid forms!"
I need Vex, Pike, Keyleth,

2105
02:39:59,273 --> 02:40:01,943
Scanlan, and Percy to all make dexterity saving
throws.

2106
02:40:01,943 --> 02:40:03,659
TALIESIN: Do I not have cover?

2107
02:40:03,659 --> 02:40:10,112
MATT: Not enough to prevent this. It's a lobbed
stream of liquid acid that comes and surrounds,

2108
02:40:10,112 --> 02:40:11,630
corroding.

2109
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:14,747
LAURA: Do we get advantage on any of it?

2110
02:40:14,747 --> 02:40:18,534
MATT: Not unless you have something that gives you
advantage on him.

2111
02:40:18,609 --> 02:40:35,076
TALIESIN: I'm spending a Resolve because that was
bullshit. Can I burn another Resolve? Goddamn it.

2112
02:40:35,076 --> 02:40:37,130
MATT: Nope. All right, so.

2113
02:40:37,130 --> 02:40:40,655
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words to buff my roll?

2114
02:40:40,655 --> 02:40:43,436
MATT: You use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.

2115
02:40:43,436 --> 02:40:50,992
SAM: But not to-- That seems right, yeah. All
right. 18.

2116
02:40:50,992 --> 02:40:58,281
MATT: 18, all right. Hold on, I'll just double-check
while you're saying this. Just to bring up

2117
02:40:58,337 --> 02:40:59,900
the ability.

2118
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,944
SAM: I should know this.

2119
02:41:01,944 --> 02:41:06,801
MATT: It would have to be a damage roll, because
there's no attack roll. There's no other roll

2120
02:41:06,801 --> 02:41:08,668
incorporated on this other than the damage roll.

2121
02:41:08,668 --> 02:41:10,486
SAM: Got it. It just happens.

2122
02:41:10,486 --> 02:41:16,945
MATT: Right. But it reduces the damage roll, 
which affects everybody.

2123
02:41:16,998 --> 02:41:22,251
ASHLEY: Wait! I think I cast Resistance. I cast it
on Keyleth, I cast it on--

2124
02:41:22,251 --> 02:41:25,531
LAURA: Me. And I think you cast it on Scanlan.

2125
02:41:25,531 --> 02:41:27,937
MATT: It's faded since it's a concentration
spell.

2126
02:41:27,937 --> 02:41:29,946
TALIESIN: Scanlan's got the armor.

2127
02:41:29,946 --> 02:41:38,569
MATT: Yeah. If you were to use Cutting Words on
this, it would reduce the damage all of you would

2128
02:41:38,663 --> 02:41:40,032
take from it.

2129
02:41:40,032 --> 02:41:42,870
SAM: All right, I will use Cutting Words to reduce
the damage.

2130
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:44,108
MATT: What are your cutting words, Scanlan?

2131
02:41:44,108 --> 02:41:48,232
SAM: My cutting words are, "Your lower intestine
smells like shit!"

2132
02:41:48,232 --> 02:41:52,487
(laughter)

2133
02:41:52,487 --> 02:41:54,938
MATT: Go ahead and roll your bardic inspiration
die.

2134
02:41:54,938 --> 02:42:03,764
SAM: A ten? Shit roll. Three!

2135
02:42:03,764 --> 02:42:08,247
MATT: So 18 saving throw. What was yours?

2136
02:42:08,247 --> 02:42:09,328
TALIESIN: Ten.

2137
02:42:09,328 --> 02:42:10,199
MATT: Keyleth?

2138
02:42:10,199 --> 02:42:11,189
MARISHA: 14.

2139
02:42:11,189 --> 02:42:15,835
MATT: Vex? One. Pike?

2140
02:42:15,835 --> 02:42:17,476
ASHLEY: Seven.

2141
02:42:17,476 --> 02:42:21,652
MATT: Seven. Okay, reduced by three, you all
suffer 47 points of acid damage.

2142
02:42:21,652 --> 02:42:26,074
SAM: Including me, with my acid armor?

2143
02:42:26,074 --> 02:42:27,917
MATT: You take half of that.

2144
02:42:27,917 --> 02:42:30,431
LAURA: Aren't you glad I gave you the armor?

2145
02:42:30,431 --> 02:42:46,248
MATT: You take 23 points of acid damage. After its
long, angry, boastful diatribe, as it rears back

2146
02:42:46,248 --> 02:42:51,667
to blow, your words confuse it, and the spray
seems a little off-center than what it

2147
02:42:51,714 --> 02:42:58,233
intended. However, most of you are now currently
dealing with the searing pain of the acid

2148
02:42:58,233 --> 02:43:01,453
pressed against your bodies. Ending that turn,
Vax, you're up.

2149
02:43:01,453 --> 02:43:04,573
LIAM: Did I see where the ejection of acid came
out from?

2150
02:43:04,573 --> 02:43:06,576
MATT: You did. It came from there, this area.

2151
02:43:06,576 --> 02:43:12,917
LIAM: Am I still at a disadvantage even though I
saw right where that crap came out?

2152
02:43:12,917 --> 02:43:15,695
MATT: Correct. Because you don't know if it moved
away or not. You don't know exactly where it is.

2153
02:43:15,695 --> 02:43:18,349
You just know it's somewhere in that vicinity.

2154
02:43:18,349 --> 02:43:25,302
LIAM: I'm going to throw two daggers at it. I hope
that Trinket's near it, but we'll see. So, at

2155
02:43:25,302 --> 02:43:31,329
disadvantage. Bollocks! That's 15.

2156
02:43:31,329 --> 02:43:33,225
MATT: Nope.

2157
02:43:33,225 --> 02:43:38,609
LIAM: 22.

2158
02:43:38,609 --> 02:43:46,505
MATT: 22 just hits. Trinket, however, is actually
adjacent to Umbrasyl. So you could do sneak attack

2159
02:43:46,505 --> 02:43:47,701
damage.

2160
02:43:47,701 --> 02:43:49,132
MARISHA: Whoa! What's up?

2161
02:43:49,132 --> 02:44:03,363
LIAM: Keen Dagger. It's 26.

2162
02:44:03,363 --> 02:44:15,177
MATT: 26. All right. So one dagger just vanishes
into the darkness. The other one sticks into the

2163
02:44:15,177 --> 02:44:20,003
hide for a second before disappearing in a plume 
of smoke, reappearing at the side of your belt. You hear a low

2164
02:44:20,074 --> 02:44:22,060
(snarling grunt).

2165
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:26,515
LIAM: Can I use my movement to go along the back
edge of the cave as far as I can? Directly

2166
02:44:26,515 --> 02:44:28,576
opposite from my family.

2167
02:44:28,576 --> 02:44:32,919
MATT: All right. Looking at the rest of this
cavern--

2168
02:44:32,919 --> 02:44:37,793
LAURA: Look at all the gold, hiding over there!

2169
02:44:37,793 --> 02:44:43,672
MATT: There is what seems to be the majority of the funds
that were gathered from Westruun, and whatever

2170
02:44:43,672 --> 02:44:49,098
else of the previous dragon's hoard have currently
been brought over to the new lair. Who knows how

2171
02:44:49,098 --> 02:44:50,654
much has been--

2172
02:44:50,654 --> 02:44:56,848
LIAM: I thought that was his magic healing spot, but
I guessed wrong.

2173
02:44:56,848 --> 02:44:58,660
MATT: So, that end your turn?

2174
02:44:58,660 --> 02:44:59,344
LIAM: Yeah.

2175
02:44:59,344 --> 02:45:01,357
MATT: All right. Now it comes to Shale.

2176
02:45:01,357 --> 02:45:03,032
CHRIS: I'm with insects, right?

2177
02:45:03,116 --> 02:45:05,688
MATT: You are currently surrounded by stinging,
biting insects.

2178
02:45:05,753 --> 02:45:13,115
CHRIS: Okay. I will stride forth. I'm slow and
old. I move 20, so I'll use all my movement, 40, to

2179
02:45:13,115 --> 02:45:14,164
advance.

2180
02:45:14,164 --> 02:45:23,967
MATT: There you go. You come pushing through,
brushing them off with your stump and your staff,

2181
02:45:23,967 --> 02:45:29,323
waving it in front. Angrily growling, you come to
rest at the side of this one pillar that juts out

2182
02:45:29,323 --> 02:45:33,036
of the ground, with Vex right above you.

2183
02:45:33,036 --> 02:45:37,850
CHRIS: I'll dimly look into the darkness and see
if I can see, hear, or there's just gray mist in

2184
02:45:37,850 --> 02:45:39,437
front of my eyes right now.

2185
02:45:39,437 --> 02:45:46,229
MATT: You can't see anything. But you do hear
right in front of you a growling, snarling bear.

2186
02:45:46,229 --> 02:45:52,915
You see elements and flashes of the bear that you
saw Vex summon forth from her throat.

2187
02:45:52,915 --> 02:45:56,749
TRAVIS: And the dagger disappeared into something,
right?

2188
02:45:56,749 --> 02:46:09,700
CHRIS: All right. But I can't hear the dragon? At
all? It's stomping around.

2189
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:14,267
MATT: It's stomping around a little bit. You saw
where the actual projectile came from, so you know

2190
02:46:14,267 --> 02:46:16,282
it's somewhere in this vicinity.

2191
02:46:16,282 --> 02:46:25,278
CHRIS: Well, you're not very brave, are you?
Invisible! Hiding! Afraid to show your face? Taunt

2192
02:46:25,278 --> 02:46:31,039
it. Oh, bollocks!

2193
02:46:31,039 --> 02:46:33,920
(laughter)

2194
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:36,536
CHRIS: Well, that would be a nine.

2195
02:46:36,536 --> 02:46:46,555
MATT: A nine. You hear, slowly curling out from
the darkness ahead of you, "Bravery means nothing.

2196
02:46:46,555 --> 02:46:52,456
"Survival and victory mean <i>everything</i>!"

2197
02:46:52,456 --> 02:46:55,203
CHRIS: Oh, shut up, you flying suitcase!

2198
02:46:55,203 --> 02:46:59,439
MATT: And that's how you end a round. Pike, you're
up.

2199
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:04,017
MARISHA: Oh, it's something my grandma would say.
So good.

2200
02:47:04,017 --> 02:47:21,630
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to hold my action and I'm
going to backpack onto Grog.

2201
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:27,518
MATT: Okay. So you move over and leap up onto
Grog's back, holding tightly. What's the trigger

2202
02:47:27,518 --> 02:47:31,896
for your action that you're holding?

2203
02:47:31,896 --> 02:47:35,485
ASHLEY: On his next attack on somebody.

2204
02:47:35,485 --> 02:47:37,786
MATT: The next time you sense the dragon is
attacking somebody?

2205
02:47:37,786 --> 02:47:38,770
ASHLEY: Yes.

2206
02:47:38,770 --> 02:47:44,120
MATT: All right. What action are you holding? Is
it a spell?

2207
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:47,022
ASHLEY: Yes.

2208
02:47:47,022 --> 02:47:52,869
MATT: So you begin preparing the spell. You are
now concentrating on it, as you're holding the

2209
02:47:52,869 --> 02:47:57,125
back of Grog. Okay. Holding that bit, that brings
us to Keyleth. What are you doing?

2210
02:47:57,125 --> 02:48:05,515
MARISHA: If I move through Insect Plague, will I
take damage? Or is it if I end in it?

2211
02:48:05,515 --> 02:48:08,758
MATT: You don't know.

2212
02:48:08,758 --> 02:48:11,718
CHRIS: I seemed to waltz through it.

2213
02:48:11,718 --> 02:48:15,056
MARISHA: That's true. You waltzed through it. And
you didn't start in it, did you?

2214
02:48:15,056 --> 02:48:16,285
CHRIS: I did.

2215
02:48:16,285 --> 02:48:19,204
MARISHA: Oh. But you took the damage up top, you
didn't take damage again after you got out of it. All

2216
02:48:19,204 --> 02:48:28,507
right. I want to see if I can move. I'm having a
hard time seeing, Matt. Can I get my full movement

2217
02:48:28,507 --> 02:48:32,001
of 30 feet into this corner here?

2218
02:48:32,001 --> 02:48:33,171
MATT: Over here?

2219
02:48:33,171 --> 02:48:34,655
MARISHA: Yeah.

2220
02:48:34,655 --> 02:48:39,565
MATT: You're going to get up around there, unless
you want to try and go over the top of the rocks.

2221
02:48:39,565 --> 02:48:41,746
That way is going to require a climb check.

2222
02:48:41,746 --> 02:48:43,563
MARISHA: Oh really, I can parkour it? Yeah!

2223
02:48:43,563 --> 02:48:45,953
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength
check.

2224
02:48:45,953 --> 02:48:49,776
MARISHA: 14.

2225
02:48:49,776 --> 02:48:56,852
MATT: Yeah, it's not too hard. You ran up, grab, leap
over the side. You can get right there.

2226
02:48:56,852 --> 02:49:02,022
MARISHA: Oh, okay. I think the dragon is roughly
here?

2227
02:49:02,022 --> 02:49:06,715
MATT: In this vicinity. You can see Trinket is
currently snarling and lashing out and biting in

2228
02:49:06,715 --> 02:49:09,033
this area of the cavern.

2229
02:49:09,033 --> 02:49:18,619
MARISHA: I'm really sorry, Grog. I'm going to cast
Faerie Fire, roughly-- Yeah, somewhere where I

2230
02:49:18,619 --> 02:49:19,859
think he is.

2231
02:49:19,859 --> 02:49:22,141
LAURA: Why is that bad?

2232
02:49:22,141 --> 02:49:27,293
MARISHA: Means you don't have acid resistance
anymore. It's a concentration spell. But none of

2233
02:49:27,293 --> 02:49:29,415
us can see him, yeah.

2234
02:49:29,415 --> 02:49:42,386
MATT: All righty. So, Faerie Fire. You guys watch
as suddenly, this burst of somewhat violet-ish

2235
02:49:42,386 --> 02:49:49,831
blue light, like a small, tiny explosion of
glitter and starlight just hits the area and

2236
02:49:49,831 --> 02:49:55,525
outlines the entirety of the large dragon
Umbrasyl.

2237
02:49:55,525 --> 02:50:01,808
MARISHA: And with my bonus action--

2238
02:50:01,808 --> 02:50:08,840
MATT: Yeah, failed saving throw.

2239
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:16,142
MARISH: Damn right, he did. With my bonus action,
I'm going to go into my--

2240
02:50:16,142 --> 02:50:18,209
MATT: Actually, you know what?

2241
02:50:18,209 --> 02:50:22,100
MARISHA: He's going to do his thing, isn't he?

2242
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:25,276
ASHLEY: You know, you don't need to.

2243
02:50:25,276 --> 02:50:32,901
MATT: Yeah, I do. Third and final legendary
resistance. You get a glimpse of where Umbrasyl is

2244
02:50:32,901 --> 02:50:40,377
and then the magic dissipates. Umbrasyl vanishes
from sight.

2245
02:50:40,377 --> 02:50:43,214
SAM: Shit.

2246
02:50:43,214 --> 02:50:48,733
TALIESIN: You've burned his third legendary
action. You've burned it. It's gone.

2247
02:50:48,733 --> 02:50:53,364
SAM: Matt, did it also negate my disadvantage from
Cutting Words, on the save?

2248
02:50:53,364 --> 02:51:00,380
MATT: He can succeed automatically. It's a choice
to succeed.

2249
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:02,525
SAM: Balls. So that's dead, too?

2250
02:51:02,525 --> 02:51:04,938
MATT: Nope.

2251
02:51:04,938 --> 02:51:08,989
SAM: Does he use the legendary action before he
fails?

2252
02:51:08,989 --> 02:51:11,095
MATT: No. That's true. Yeah.

2253
02:51:11,153 --> 02:51:12,376
SAM: So it kills that too?

2254
02:51:12,376 --> 02:51:13,783
MATT: It does, yeah.

2255
02:51:13,783 --> 02:51:17,937
SAM: Nice. No, my thing's dead too. He
double-fucked us.

2256
02:51:17,937 --> 02:51:19,884
MARISHA: Great. Fuck you, asshole!

2257
02:51:19,884 --> 02:51:21,774
LAURA: He doesn't save it like that?

2258
02:51:21,774 --> 02:51:27,630
MATT: Well, no. Essentially he rolled at
disadvantage to make the saving throw. Failed it.

2259
02:51:27,630 --> 02:51:32,012
And then decided to succeed using legendary
resistance.

2260
02:51:32,012 --> 02:51:33,951
MARISHA: Okay. But it's gone! They're gone.

2261
02:51:33,951 --> 02:51:35,354
ASHLEY: They're gone, <i>gone</i>?

2262
02:51:35,354 --> 02:51:40,670
MATT: As far as you know, from previous experience
with dragons, there are no further uses of its

2263
02:51:40,670 --> 02:51:42,736
legendary resistance.

2264
02:51:42,736 --> 02:51:44,527
MARISHA: What a dick.

2265
02:51:44,527 --> 02:51:54,482
MATT: Does that end your turn, Keyleth? It's a level one
spell, you still have more up your sleeves if you

2266
02:51:54,482 --> 02:51:57,583
wanted to try it later.

2267
02:51:57,583 --> 02:52:07,116
MARISHA: I know. I don't think I'm going to go
into my beast shape form so I can do another

2268
02:52:07,116 --> 02:52:13,488
spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I
could take a bonus action to hide in this little

2269
02:52:13,488 --> 02:52:15,205
nook and cranny here?

2270
02:52:15,205 --> 02:52:17,460
MATT: You can't use a bonus action to hide,
unfortunately.

2271
02:52:17,460 --> 02:52:18,979
MARISHA: Because I'm not a rogue?

2272
02:52:18,979 --> 02:52:20,754
MATT: Because you're not a rogue. Sorry, girl.

2273
02:52:20,754 --> 02:52:25,643
MARISHA: Can I hug that pillar and say,
(panting)?

2274
02:52:25,643 --> 02:52:30,807
MATT: You can totally do that. And you are
currently hugging in the pillar going, (panting).

2275
02:52:30,877 --> 02:52:38,939
At the end of Keyleth's turn, it's going to use
two of its legendary actions to wing attack. It's

2276
02:52:38,939 --> 02:52:45,836
going to beat its wings, everything within 15 feet, which
right now would only be Trinket, has to go ahead

2277
02:52:45,836 --> 02:52:50,446
and succeed on a dexterity saving throw. Go ahead and
roll a dexterity saving throw for Trinket.

2278
02:52:50,446 --> 02:52:57,039
LAURA: I'm going to roll the brown 
dice for Trinket. Dexterity? 12.

2279
02:52:57,039 --> 02:53:00,419
MATT: 12. Okay. So Trinket takes 15 points of
bludgeoning damage--

2280
02:53:00,419 --> 02:53:02,765
LAURA: He's resistant to bludgeoning!

2281
02:53:02,765 --> 02:53:03,995
MATT: Because of the armor?

2282
02:53:03,995 --> 02:53:04,864
LAURA: Yes!

2283
02:53:04,864 --> 02:53:08,262
MAT: So takes seven points of bludgeoning damage.
However, he is still knocked prone from the blast

2284
02:53:08,328 --> 02:53:16,495
of wind that whooshes through the entirety of the
cavern, causing dust to raise up. The cloud of

2285
02:53:16,495 --> 02:53:20,441
insects gets shifted a little bit before having to
reform back into its place from the sheer force.

2286
02:53:20,441 --> 02:53:29,413
In doing so, suddenly, there's a rush of air, and
two giant slamming sounds, as feet have placed

2287
02:53:29,413 --> 02:53:39,029
themselves right up front with Shale and Vax. Vex.
I've got a lot to concentrate on.

2288
02:53:39,029 --> 02:53:43,452
SAM: When I die, I'm coming back as a character
named Vix.

2289
02:53:43,452 --> 02:53:51,305
MATT: Then you can find another Dungeon Master.
All right, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Grog,

2290
02:53:51,305 --> 02:53:52,451
you're up.

2291
02:53:52,451 --> 02:53:58,602
TRAVIS: I take the tiny Pike backpack, and I would
like to run along the right, the farther wall from

2292
02:53:58,602 --> 02:54:00,974
you. Opposite direction.

2293
02:54:00,974 --> 02:54:02,163
MATT: This way?

2294
02:54:02,163 --> 02:54:02,989
TRAVIS: Yes.

2295
02:54:02,989 --> 02:54:03,907
MATT: All right.

2296
02:54:03,907 --> 02:54:08,804
TRAVIS: 50 feet, using diagonals to try and get
as far around that pool as I can.

2297
02:54:08,804 --> 02:54:19,238
MATT: That's about as far as you can get there. So
that's movement with Pike on your back. So, that's

2298
02:54:19,238 --> 02:54:20,961
your movement?

2299
02:54:20,961 --> 02:54:25,987
TRAVIS: Yep. And I'll use my bonus action to go
into a rage.

2300
02:54:25,987 --> 02:54:28,891
MATT: All right. (growling)

2301
02:54:28,891 --> 02:54:30,986
TRAVIS: Hey Pike, gimme a slap!

2302
02:54:30,986 --> 02:54:32,793
ASHLEY: (slap)

2303
02:54:32,793 --> 02:54:35,036
TRAVIS: (growls)

2304
02:54:35,036 --> 02:54:40,869
MATT: Sends you into the rage. You still have your
action. Anything you want to do?

2305
02:54:40,869 --> 02:54:42,582
TRAVIS: Nope.

2306
02:54:42,582 --> 02:54:45,567
MATT: Are you holding your action for any
particular thing?

2307
02:54:45,567 --> 02:54:48,920
TRAVIS: Well, I can't really hit him from here.

2308
02:54:48,920 --> 02:54:54,277
MATT: All right. That ends Grog's turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

2309
02:54:54,277 --> 02:54:56,294
SAM: I can't see him, right?

2310
02:54:56,294 --> 02:54:58,337
MATT: Not from what you can tell, no.

2311
02:54:58,337 --> 02:55:18,989
SAM: Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh,
shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh,

2312
02:55:18,989 --> 02:55:32,451
here's what I will do: I'll start by inspiring
Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I

2313
02:55:32,451 --> 02:55:45,629
will always buff you! And then I will pick 
a place and cast Stinking Cloud.

2314
02:55:45,629 --> 02:55:49,671
MATT: Okay. You take your d10 inspiration die.

2315
02:55:49,671 --> 02:55:51,122
CHRIS: Excellent.

2316
02:55:51,122 --> 02:55:57,656
MATT: And Stinking Cloud. Haven't seen that in a
while.

2317
02:55:57,656 --> 02:56:03,437
SAM: No! Oh well, it's too late, I already said
it.

2318
02:56:03,437 --> 02:56:07,503
MATT: Stinking Cloud. Where are you setting it?

2319
02:56:07,503 --> 02:56:12,393
SAM: Can I have a pointer? Well, I'll just come
over. Right here.

2320
02:56:12,393 --> 02:56:18,408
MATT: Right there? All right. We'll put this over
here to keep track of the Stinking Cloud, we'll just

2321
02:56:18,408 --> 02:56:29,203
know the insects are in this vicinity as most people
have passed beyond it. With that, Umbrasyl is

2322
02:56:29,203 --> 02:56:38,584
going to attempt a constitution saving throw.
Three plus 14, that's a 17. What's the DC?

2323
02:56:38,584 --> 02:56:40,426
SAM: 20.

2324
02:56:40,426 --> 02:56:49,977
MATT: All right. That will technically be at the
start of its turn, but we will carry that over.

2325
02:56:49,977 --> 02:57:02,020
All right. The cloud appears in this space. You
can already hear (coughing). Are you going to move

2326
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,830
or stay where you are?

2327
02:57:03,830 --> 02:57:05,791
SAM: There's no more cloud of insects, yeah?

2328
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:07,469
MATT: It's still in this vicinity.

2329
02:57:07,469 --> 02:57:11,857
SAM: Is there any way to avoid it? Move up to
where Kiki is or anything?

2330
02:57:11,857 --> 02:57:13,667
MATT: Yeah, if you want to make a strength check
to climb.

2331
02:57:13,667 --> 02:57:18,729
SAM: All right, I'll do that. I'll move up 
to where Kiki is. 17.

2332
02:57:18,729 --> 02:57:24,998
MATT: 17. Yeah, you actually hopscotch up, leap
over Percy and get up on top next to her over there.

2333
02:57:24,998 --> 02:57:28,263
SAM: Oh, Percy! Didn't notice your bald spot
there.

2334
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:30,582
TALIESIN: It just grows in lighter.

2335
02:57:30,582 --> 02:57:32,235
SAM: Sure.

2336
02:57:32,235 --> 02:57:40,185
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan.
With that, it's going to use its third legendary

2337
02:57:40,185 --> 02:57:46,271
action this turn to attempt a tail attack against
you, <i>Vex.</i>

2338
02:57:46,271 --> 02:57:48,169
LAURA: Thank you.

2339
02:57:48,169 --> 02:57:49,883
MATT: You're welcome.

2340
02:57:49,883 --> 02:57:51,258
LIAM: That's Vix.

2341
02:57:51,258 --> 02:57:55,814
MATT: I will stab you. That is a 19 to hit.

2342
02:57:55,814 --> 02:57:58,486
LAURA: Nope. 20.

2343
02:57:58,486 --> 02:58:07,399
MATT: 20! With that, you dodge out of the way.
You feel the impact of some large, heavy slam onto

2344
02:58:07,399 --> 02:58:12,761
the stone right next to you. Pieces of it break
off, and then withdraws, barely dodging it in

2345
02:58:12,761 --> 02:58:17,230
time. All right, that ends--

2346
02:58:17,230 --> 02:58:19,368
ASHLEY: Since he made an attack, can I?

2347
02:58:19,368 --> 02:58:20,993
MATT: Yes, you can.

2348
02:58:20,993 --> 02:58:33,717
ASHLEY: I would like to Command him to be visible.
Reveal himself.

2349
02:58:33,717 --> 02:58:35,653
MATT: What's the word?

2350
02:58:35,653 --> 02:58:40,875
ASHLEY: Reveal! Appear!

2351
02:58:40,875 --> 02:58:49,697
MATT: Appear. There you go! Oh, that's cocked. All
right. That is a19 plus 11. I'm pretty sure it

2352
02:58:49,697 --> 02:58:51,397
makes the save.

2353
02:58:51,397 --> 02:58:53,184
ASHLEY: Fuck you!

2354
02:58:53,184 --> 02:58:55,244
MATT: Sorry.

2355
02:58:55,244 --> 02:58:58,560
ASHLEY: Do I still get a bonus action?

2356
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:01,446
MATT: That would've been during your turn. You can only
hold your action.

2357
02:59:01,446 --> 02:59:03,429
ASHLEY: (snarls frustratedly)

2358
02:59:03,429 --> 02:59:09,704
MATT: Good try. Brings us to the top. Percy,
you're up.

2359
02:59:09,704 --> 02:59:15,007
TALIESIN: Oh god! Okay, I'm going to take a second
to try and pray that my second gun doesn't break

2360
02:59:15,007 --> 02:59:21,618
because that's going to get really ugly! And it
doesn't! My gun is fine.

2361
02:59:21,618 --> 02:59:22,990
MATT: All right.

2362
02:59:22,990 --> 02:59:33,940
TALIESIN: My gun is fine. But that's it. I'm going
to start running straight down, as far as my legs

2363
02:59:33,940 --> 02:59:37,408
will take me. Not that way, towards the pool.

2364
02:59:37,408 --> 02:59:39,184
MATT: Towards the pool?

2365
02:59:39,184 --> 02:59:43,387
TALIESIN: Right there. Oh no, that's the insects,
that's right. So, yeah.

2366
02:59:43,387 --> 02:59:45,037
MARISHA: As long as you get out of it.

2367
02:59:45,037 --> 02:59:50,112
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll around to the stone to
the right, then. As far as I can go.

2368
02:59:50,112 --> 02:59:55,385
MATT: You can get there. You're outside of the
insect cloud, not a worry. As you're running,

2369
02:59:55,385 --> 02:59:59,831
you're cleaning it, polishing, loading it. Okay,
looks good.

2370
02:59:59,831 --> 03:00:05,901
TALIESIN: Oh, yes. I'm going to spend my bonus
action to do a quick heal.

2371
03:00:05,974 --> 03:00:07,930
MATT: Okay, your Second Wind?

2372
03:00:07,930 --> 03:00:09,122
TALIESIN: My Second Wind.

2373
03:00:09,122 --> 03:00:10,088
MATT: Go for it.

2374
03:00:10,088 --> 03:00:16,183
TALIESIN: Oh, god. That was awful. That's okay.
So, yeah. Good. You can move on, sorry.

2375
03:00:16,183 --> 03:00:17,440
MATT: Okay. Vex.

2376
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:21,513
LAURA: Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your
Stinking Cloud is right there.

2377
03:00:21,513 --> 03:00:27,643
MATT: Yeah. You do see some elements of the cloud
are displaced in places. It's not showing you

2378
03:00:27,643 --> 03:00:33,381
exactly where it is, but you are aware that the entity
of Umbrasyl is directly in front of Shale, and

2379
03:00:33,381 --> 03:00:35,421
nearly directly in front of you.

2380
03:00:35,421 --> 03:00:37,832
MARISHA: Enough to negate the disadvantage?

2381
03:00:37,832 --> 03:00:44,340
MATT: No. Not to mention the fact that you are
technically in its melee range. So any of your

2382
03:00:44,340 --> 03:00:45,594
ranged attacks--

2383
03:00:45,594 --> 03:00:47,997
LAURA: Are at disadvantage again, right?

2384
03:00:47,997 --> 03:00:54,456
MATT: Unless it's five foot. Is it five foot, or
is it melee? Trying to remember. I think it's five

2385
03:00:54,456 --> 03:00:57,182
feet. But regardless, it's close to you, it's bad
news.

2386
03:00:57,182 --> 03:01:03,072
LAURA: If Trinket gets up, does that use any of my
stuff? Trinket can move freely--

2387
03:01:03,072 --> 03:01:04,608
MATT: Trinket can move independently of you.

2388
03:01:04,608 --> 03:01:06,505
LAURA: So Trinket is going to get up.

2389
03:01:06,505 --> 03:01:08,205
MATT: It's half-movement, yeah.

2390
03:01:08,205 --> 03:01:18,415
LAURA: And he's going to bite Umbrasyl's tail to
try to distract him, so I can run between his legs.

2391
03:01:18,415 --> 03:01:24,861
MATT: Okay. So Trinket's going to go ahead and--
roll a perception check for Trinket.

2392
03:01:24,861 --> 03:01:27,010
LIAM: Trinket, snack attack!

2393
03:01:27,010 --> 03:01:37,272
LAURA: Oh, he's got a keen sense of smell, so
he's got advantage on smell perception.

2394
03:01:37,272 --> 03:01:43,523
MATT: But there is a Stinking Cloud right there.
Roll again. We'll see if Trinket can discern

2395
03:01:43,523 --> 03:01:44,821
between--

2396
03:01:44,821 --> 03:01:47,726
LAURA: Well, I rolled a 15. And I don't know what
I add to it.

2397
03:01:47,726 --> 03:01:50,022
MATT: That would be Trinket's wisdom--

2398
03:01:50,022 --> 03:01:53,391
LAURA: --oh, perception, seven. So 22

2399
03:01:53,391 --> 03:02:02,527
MATT: 22. Okay. Trinket (bear sniffs and growl)
runs past here, but can only make 20 feet of its

2400
03:02:02,527 --> 03:02:05,745
movement because he used the rest to get out of
prone. However, strafes aside and begins

2401
03:02:05,745 --> 03:02:09,135
reaching out and starts snapping, so you want
to give Trinket--?

2402
03:02:09,135 --> 03:02:10,636
LAURA: He's going to attack him.

2403
03:02:10,636 --> 03:02:13,429
MATT: Okay. As part of your attack action? Is that
what you're doing?

2404
03:02:13,429 --> 03:02:18,090
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to have Trinket do one of
his attacks so I can move and run.

2405
03:02:18,090 --> 03:02:24,963
MATT: As your bonus action on it? Okay, go for it.
Have Trinket roll for an attack. With disadvantage

2406
03:02:24,963 --> 03:02:28,930
because it is invisible.

2407
03:02:28,930 --> 03:02:36,060
LAURA: That doesn't count? I feel like it still
counts, though. It's only 15.

2408
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:43,120
MATT: 15. Trinket slashes out in the air. With the
obfuscation of the Stinking Cloud and the

2409
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:46,629
invisible dragon, Trinket's just getting mouthfuls
of air.

2410
03:02:46,629 --> 03:02:48,595
LAURA: What does Stinking Cloud do to me?

2411
03:02:48,595 --> 03:02:50,803
MARISHA and SAM: Makes you sick.

2412
03:02:50,803 --> 03:02:55,578
LAURA: Fuck. I try to run away. I try to run
around and run past Umbrasyl.

2413
03:02:55,578 --> 03:02:57,067
SAM: You're not in the cloud.

2414
03:02:57,067 --> 03:03:00,399
LAURA: But I would go through it if I tried to run
between its legs. I'll just try to run along to

2415
03:03:00,399 --> 03:03:01,578
the side.

2416
03:03:01,578 --> 03:03:05,803
MATT: On the broom, still?

2417
03:03:05,803 --> 03:03:10,615
LAURA: Sure! Why the fuck not?! I'm on the broom.
Does it matter?

2418
03:03:10,615 --> 03:03:15,780
MATT: I mean, that will give you a little more
action, you just can't attack from the broom

2419
03:03:15,780 --> 03:03:19,243
because you'll have disadvantage on your attacks since
you haven't finished your set-up yet.

2420
03:03:19,243 --> 03:03:27,366
LAURA: Jesus. I just want to run, on the broom,
and use my bonus action. Is that as far as I can get?

2421
03:03:27,366 --> 03:03:30,572
MATT: As far as you can get on your regular feet.

2422
03:03:30,572 --> 03:03:32,498
LAURA: On my broom, though?

2423
03:03:32,498 --> 03:03:33,489
MATT: There.

2424
03:03:33,489 --> 03:03:37,677
LAURA: And can I use my bonus action to hide? Can
I try to hide?

2425
03:03:37,677 --> 03:03:43,446
MATT: You are completely out in the open. You have
no way of hiding right now. You be can like, "Hide!

2426
03:03:43,446 --> 03:03:45,449
"You don't see me!"

2427
03:03:45,449 --> 03:03:47,427
LIAM: You can dash and get further away.

2428
03:03:47,453 --> 03:03:49,520
LAURA: I'm going to dash and I'm going to get further
away.

2429
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:54,696
LIAM: Rogue bonus action? Hide, dash, disengage.

2430
03:03:54,696 --> 03:03:57,349
MATT: Yes, you can.

2431
03:03:57,349 --> 03:04:00,119
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to hide behind those
things.

2432
03:04:00,119 --> 03:04:00,940
MATT: There?

2433
03:04:00,940 --> 03:04:01,865
LAURA: Yeah.

2434
03:04:01,865 --> 03:04:05,229
MATT: Okay, you can get there. However, as you
rush by, Umbrasyl does get an attack of

2435
03:04:05,229 --> 03:04:10,569
opportunity on you. He's going to make a bite as
you rush by. That is going to be a 30 to hit?

2436
03:04:10,569 --> 03:04:11,921
LAURA: I think that hits.

2437
03:04:11,921 --> 03:04:12,883
MATT: All right.

2438
03:04:12,883 --> 03:04:14,791
ASHLEY: Isn't it at a disadvantage since he's in
smoke?

2439
03:04:14,791 --> 03:04:16,135
MATT: Huh?

2440
03:04:16,135 --> 03:04:17,540
LAURA: Because he's in farts?

2441
03:04:17,540 --> 03:04:19,168
MATT: No. That's not quite what it does.

2442
03:04:19,168 --> 03:04:22,699
(laughter)

2443
03:04:22,699 --> 03:04:39,095
MATT: Oh, that's a d10. Sorry. You take 25 points of
piercing damage. Plus an additional eight points

2444
03:04:39,095 --> 03:04:41,431
of acid damage from the inside of its mouth.

2445
03:04:41,431 --> 03:04:43,007
LAURA: Cool. Tight, tight.

2446
03:04:43,007 --> 03:04:48,664
MATT: A total of 33 points of damage as you rush
past. All right, that ends your turn, Vex?

2447
03:04:48,664 --> 03:04:52,356
LAURA: Oh, that it does.

2448
03:04:52,356 --> 03:05:00,149
MATT: All right. The insect cloud fades away,
insects just dying off and dropping to the ground

2449
03:05:00,149 --> 03:05:12,425
in piles of currently twitching insects. However,
the acid pools suddenly begin to rumble and expand

2450
03:05:12,425 --> 03:05:13,893
and reach out.

2451
03:05:13,893 --> 03:05:16,788
LAURA: I'm glad I hid by another acid pool.

2452
03:05:16,788 --> 03:05:21,502
MATT: Any creature within 20 feet of the pool has
to make a strength saving throw. So that will be

2453
03:05:21,502 --> 03:05:26,937
Shale, Grog, Pike and Vex.

2454
03:05:26,937 --> 03:05:28,140
LAURA: Yay.

2455
03:05:28,140 --> 03:05:29,409
CHRIS: Five!

2456
03:05:29,409 --> 03:05:34,025
SAM: You have inspiration, if you want to use
it.

2457
03:05:34,025 --> 03:05:36,397
ASHLEY: What are we rolling for?

2458
03:05:36,397 --> 03:05:38,447
LAURA: A strength or a dex saving throw?

2459
03:05:38,447 --> 03:05:40,811
MATT: Strength.

2460
03:05:40,811 --> 03:05:45,441
TRAVIS: 23.

2461
03:05:45,441 --> 03:05:48,641
MATT: 23, good to know. Pike?

2462
03:05:48,641 --> 03:05:49,822
ASHLEY: 21.

2463
03:05:49,822 --> 03:05:50,984
MATT: All right.

2464
03:05:50,984 --> 03:05:52,229
LAURA: 13.

2465
03:05:52,229 --> 03:06:01,477
MATT: 13. And? Five. All right, so you guys both
manage to, as the pool swishes out and comes up

2466
03:06:01,477 --> 03:06:06,411
to your knees, Grog, and you just pull back and
lean against the wall. As the pool subsides back,

2467
03:06:06,411 --> 03:06:16,688
no immediate effect. Just barely manages to catch
you. However, both Shale and Vax are pulled 20

2468
03:06:16,688 --> 03:06:17,742
feet into the pool--

2469
03:06:17,742 --> 03:06:19,123
LAURA: Vex.

2470
03:06:19,123 --> 03:06:22,338
MATT: I'm sorry. Vex. I keep saying it now.
Over and over again. Pulled into the actual

2471
03:06:22,338 --> 03:06:23,465
acid pool.

2472
03:06:23,465 --> 03:06:25,607
LAURA: It's like adding insult to injury. You're
going to die and I'm going to call you your

2473
03:06:25,607 --> 03:06:27,093
brother the entire time.

2474
03:06:27,093 --> 03:06:31,991
MATT: Yep. I'm sorry about that. You both are
knocked prone and pulled into the water. Because

2475
03:06:31,991 --> 03:06:39,504
it is an acid pit, you both also suffer 12 points
of acid damage. Both Shale and Vex.

2476
03:06:39,504 --> 03:06:42,317
MARISHA: That's a thing that can happen. All
right.

2477
03:06:42,317 --> 03:06:49,010
MATT: All right. Now Umbrasyl, who failed the
saving throw--

2478
03:06:49,010 --> 03:06:52,159
SAM: Gets to spend his entire turn coughing.

2479
03:06:52,159 --> 03:06:57,824
MATT: I can't believe Stinking Cloud worked.

2480
03:06:57,824 --> 03:07:02,516
SAM: Spends his entire turn.

2481
03:07:02,516 --> 03:07:05,830
MATT: The creature spends its action retching and
reeling.

2482
03:07:05,830 --> 03:07:13,436
LIAM: I hope he coughs his innards out the hole in
his gut. Dragon hernia.

2483
03:07:13,436 --> 03:07:19,262
MATT: Yep. So the action is spent, the dragon is
just (coughing), which is good because it rolled a

2484
03:07:19,262 --> 03:07:26,739
five and got its breath weapon back. But it can't
use it this turn because it's coughing and "You--

2485
03:07:26,739 --> 03:07:33,890
"I will-- " It rears back, about to spit the acid
before (coughs) and bits of it come streaming out

2486
03:07:33,890 --> 03:07:42,225
of the nose, like the milk-in-the-nostrils thing
except for it's acid. That's the dragon. Okay.

2487
03:07:42,278 --> 03:07:56,993
That ends its action. It is going to move out, see
if it's-- I forgot to roll concentration for the

2488
03:07:56,993 --> 03:08:04,888
Invisibility on the last attack that happened. I
just rolled a one. With that, it appears once

2489
03:08:04,888 --> 03:08:07,758
again on the map. The Invisibility spell no longer
there.

2490
03:08:07,758 --> 03:08:09,180
MARISHA: Oh, thank god!

2491
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:11,935
LAURA: Now we can watch it kill us.

2492
03:08:11,935 --> 03:08:19,227
MATT: It's going to stomp over, out of the cloud,
right there.

2493
03:08:19,227 --> 03:08:24,223
SAM: Does Trinket get an attack?

2494
03:08:24,223 --> 03:08:27,273
MATT: He does, actually. Go ahead and roll for
Trinket.

2495
03:08:27,273 --> 03:08:36,790
LAURA: Yeah, he does! I don't know which one to
roll here. They've all been betraying me. 17.

2496
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:43,586
MATT: 17? That misses. Or it hits and Trinket's
claws streak across the back of the dragon's hide.

2497
03:08:43,586 --> 03:08:47,988
No damage sustained. But good job, Trinket. All
right, so--

2498
03:08:47,988 --> 03:08:51,117
LAURA: He's trying, man. He's out. He's so brave.

2499
03:08:51,117 --> 03:08:53,617
MATT: He's doing great. Vax, you're up.

2500
03:08:53,617 --> 03:08:59,067
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to dart out behind the
pillar of stone there. And I'm going to chuck a

2501
03:08:59,067 --> 03:09:00,233
dagger at it.

2502
03:09:00,233 --> 03:09:02,129
MATT: All right. What's the far range on it?

2503
03:09:02,129 --> 03:09:04,724
LIAM: 60. I'm a Sharpshooter, so there's no
disadvantage.

2504
03:09:04,724 --> 03:09:07,339
MATT: He's out of range.

2505
03:09:07,339 --> 03:09:11,088
LIAM: Then I'll move closer. I mean, I know how
far I can throw a dagger, so I want to get up

2506
03:09:11,088 --> 03:09:13,543
close enough to be within range to throw a dagger.

2507
03:09:13,543 --> 03:09:21,747
MATT: Still can't get close enough, not with your
full movement. You can move 30 feet.

2508
03:09:21,747 --> 03:09:23,497
LIAM: Where are you? You're in the acid?

2509
03:09:23,497 --> 03:09:24,725
LAURA: I am in the acid.

2510
03:09:24,725 --> 03:09:30,825
LIAM: Oh! I'm going to go to my sister, I'm going
to drag her out and I'm going to pop the one

2511
03:09:30,825 --> 03:09:32,602
healing potion I have down her gullet.

2512
03:09:32,602 --> 03:09:33,841
MATT: Okay.

2513
03:09:33,841 --> 03:09:37,098
LIAM: I'm going to pull her behind, so we're both
behind that pillar.

2514
03:09:37,098 --> 03:09:40,158
MATT: Okay, so you pull her behind the pillar. You
go ahead and feed her the healing potion. That is

2515
03:09:40,158 --> 03:09:42,455
your turn. He dragged you out of the acid pool.

2516
03:09:42,455 --> 03:09:43,982
LIAM: Potion of greater healing.

2517
03:09:43,982 --> 03:09:51,457
MATT: All right, so that is a 4d4 plus four
healing to you. That ends Vax's turn. Shale,

2518
03:09:51,457 --> 03:09:52,564
you're up.

2519
03:09:52,564 --> 03:10:00,848
CHRIS: All right. I'm going to stand up if I can
and make my way back onto firm rock. Do I take

2520
03:10:00,848 --> 03:10:03,626
any damage when I start my turn?

2521
03:10:03,626 --> 03:10:13,351
MATT: You do, actually. You take six points of
acid damage. You've now stepped up right there.

2522
03:10:13,351 --> 03:10:16,060
The dragon is fully visible to you.

2523
03:10:16,060 --> 03:10:21,908
CHRIS: Pick on someone your own size! And I whack
him on the derriere with my staff.

2524
03:10:21,908 --> 03:10:27,594
MATT: Go for it. You have three attacks, correct?

2525
03:10:27,594 --> 03:10:36,124
CHRIS: The first one is a very sad 14. I'm not
going to waste the d10 on that.

2526
03:10:36,124 --> 03:10:38,091
MATT: Across the hide, no damage.

2527
03:10:38,091 --> 03:10:39,496
CHRIS: Oh my god!

2528
03:10:39,496 --> 03:10:41,535
MARISHA: No, Chris, no.

2529
03:10:41,535 --> 03:10:44,098
SAM: Inspiration?

2530
03:10:44,098 --> 03:10:46,424
CHRIS: Natural one.

2531
03:10:46,424 --> 03:10:54,562
MATT: As a level 13 fighter, don't you get a
third attack with your action?

2532
03:10:54,562 --> 03:11:02,067
CHRIS: What's that? Oh, yes, you're right. That
one, I rolled a 19. I will spend the inspiration

2533
03:11:02,067 --> 03:11:04,472
die and turn it into a 26.

2534
03:11:04,472 --> 03:11:08,543
MATT: Okay. Roll damage with the quarterstaff.

2535
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:15,985
CHRIS: I do 11 points of whacky-whacky damage and
try to bait this thing into turning on me.

2536
03:11:15,985 --> 03:11:17,222
MATT: Okay.

2537
03:11:17,222 --> 03:11:21,179
CHRIS: I will also use my second wind.

2538
03:11:21,179 --> 03:11:22,878
MATT: All right. Go for it.

2539
03:11:22,878 --> 03:11:25,370
CHRIS: To regain 15 hit points.

2540
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:30,539
MATT: 15 hit points to you, go for it. Ending 
Shale's turn, that brings us to Pike. But at the

2541
03:11:30,539 --> 03:11:35,726
end of Shale's turn, the dragon is going to use
a legendary action to attempt a tail attack

2542
03:11:35,726 --> 03:11:42,178
against you, Scanlan, as you are the source of
the Stinking Cloud that caused it to cough. It

2543
03:11:42,178 --> 03:11:51,509
goes, (growls) "Foolish bard, get back into my
stomach!" And as it whips around, its tail comes

2544
03:11:51,509 --> 03:11:54,670
streaking overhead and it rolls a natural one!

2545
03:11:54,670 --> 03:11:57,305
(cheering)

2546
03:11:57,305 --> 03:12:09,316
MATT: As it spins around, that's when your staff
actually hits the back of its hide. As it does, it

2547
03:12:09,316 --> 03:12:17,938
gooses it a little, in a sensitive
place, and the tail arcs strangely and slams

2548
03:12:17,990 --> 03:12:20,530
into the stone, next to you, missing you by about
six inches.

2549
03:12:20,530 --> 03:12:22,812
SAM: Ah! Great. I'll take it.

2550
03:12:22,812 --> 03:12:25,789
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

2551
03:12:25,789 --> 03:12:28,451
ASHLEY: All right. (sing-song) I'm going to
Guiding Bolt him right up the butt!

2552
03:12:28,451 --> 03:12:31,245
(laughter)

2553
03:12:31,245 --> 03:12:32,790
MATT: You're in the position for it.

2554
03:12:32,790 --> 03:12:33,827
ASHLEY: Yep!

2555
03:12:33,827 --> 03:12:35,318
MATT: What level are you casting Guiding Bolt?

2556
03:12:35,318 --> 03:12:36,609
ASHLEY: Third.

2557
03:12:36,609 --> 03:12:46,726
MATT: Third level on Guiding Bolt. All right. That
will put it at 6d6. So go ahead and roll a spell

2558
03:12:46,726 --> 03:12:48,188
attack.

2559
03:12:48,188 --> 03:12:56,729
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

2560
03:12:56,729 --> 03:13:01,728
MATT: Go ahead and roll 6d6 and we'll double it.

2561
03:13:01,728 --> 03:13:05,421
ASHLEY: And double it?

2562
03:13:05,421 --> 03:13:06,920
MATT: It's a critical hit.

2563
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:09,324
ASHLEY: I've never done that before!

2564
03:13:09,324 --> 03:13:11,433
CHRIS: Right up the butt!

2565
03:13:11,433 --> 03:13:17,395
MARISHA: Monstah! Kill him!

2566
03:13:17,395 --> 03:13:20,314
LIAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Kan-cho!

2567
03:13:20,314 --> 03:13:30,768
ASHLEY: Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points.

2568
03:13:30,768 --> 03:13:38,379
MATT: 50 points of radiant damage right up
Umbrasyl's posterior. Suddenly as Pike, still

2569
03:13:38,379 --> 03:13:44,464
clutching onto the back of Grog, you reach and grab the
symbol of Sarenrae, leaving your sword to the side of

2570
03:13:44,464 --> 03:13:48,917
your sheath, hold it forward. And as you do, you
concentrate, a glowing beam of radiant energy

2571
03:13:48,917 --> 03:13:54,690
shoots forward just as Shale knocks the backside
of Umbrasyl. The tail streaks overhead to hit

2572
03:13:54,690 --> 03:14:02,899
Scanlan, leaves you a nice, direct shot right at
the dragon rump. There's a dull (impact) sound,

2573
03:14:02,899 --> 03:14:09,315
and Umbrasyl sits straight up for a second
(confused noise, explosion) as there's a burst of

2574
03:14:09,315 --> 03:14:16,189
divine, explosive energy right in the posterior
(painful growl). Looking back, there's now a shiny

2575
03:14:16,189 --> 03:14:21,062
glow, pulsing from the back of Umbrasyl's body.
And the next attack has advantage against

2576
03:14:21,062 --> 03:14:22,464
Umbrasyl.

2577
03:14:22,464 --> 03:14:26,845
ASHLEY: Still alive!

2578
03:14:26,845 --> 03:14:31,650
MATT: That's your action. You still have your
movement and bonus, if you want.

2579
03:14:31,650 --> 03:14:47,950
ASHLEY: Okay. I think I'm going to stay, and then
bonus action, I'm going to throw up a Spiritual

2580
03:14:47,950 --> 03:14:49,507
Weapon.

2581
03:14:49,507 --> 03:14:56,406
MATT: Okay. Where do you want your Spiritual
Weapon to go? What level is Spiritual Weapon,

2582
03:14:56,406 --> 03:14:58,134
Second level? Yep.

2583
03:14:58,134 --> 03:15:05,541
ASHLEY: Yeah. A really large meathook.

2584
03:15:05,541 --> 03:15:11,067
MATT: All right. Where are you setting it?

2585
03:15:11,067 --> 03:15:14,391
ASHLEY: Right at his back.

2586
03:15:14,391 --> 03:15:21,197
MATT: All right. Sitting right there at the tail
of Umbrasyl, this giant, glowing, radiant meathook

2587
03:15:21,197 --> 03:15:27,715
appears and makes its strike. Go ahead and make
your spell attack against Umbrasyl.

2588
03:15:27,715 --> 03:15:34,441
ASHLEY: 27.

2589
03:15:34,441 --> 03:15:41,735
MATT: All right. That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage. It's a 1d8 plus five.

2590
03:15:41,735 --> 03:15:46,720
ASHLEY: Ten.

2591
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:54,556
MATT: Nice, all right. Going to stay where you
are? Or you going to move?

2592
03:15:54,556 --> 03:15:57,309
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay with my Grog.

2593
03:15:57,309 --> 03:16:01,808
MATT: So you're still piggybacking on Grog. Got
it. Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Keyleth, you're

2594
03:16:01,808 --> 03:16:06,019
up. Actually, at the end of Pike's turn--

2595
03:16:06,019 --> 03:16:09,310
ASHLEY: You know what, I'm sorry, I'm going to get
off his back.

2596
03:16:09,310 --> 03:16:11,089
MATT: Okay. You're staying where you are, though?

2597
03:16:11,089 --> 03:16:12,117
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2598
03:16:12,117 --> 03:16:15,030
MATT: Okay, so you'll be there. At the end
of your turn, Umbrasyl's going to use another

2599
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:18,424
legendary action to make a second tail attack
at Scanlan again, frustrated by this whole

2600
03:16:18,424 --> 03:16:20,067
circumstance.

2601
03:16:20,067 --> 03:16:21,396
SAM: I'm sure he is.

2602
03:16:21,396 --> 03:16:23,635
MATT: That's a 20.

2603
03:16:23,635 --> 03:16:28,044
SAM: Can I use Cutting Words?

2604
03:16:28,044 --> 03:16:29,792
MATT: You may, if you want to.

2605
03:16:29,792 --> 03:16:31,040
SAM: All right.

2606
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:32,283
MATT: It's a natural 20.

2607
03:16:32,283 --> 03:16:33,260
SAM: Oh?!

2608
03:16:33,260 --> 03:16:34,879
MATT: You could reduce the damage though, with
your Cutting Words.

2609
03:16:34,879 --> 03:16:36,167
SAM: All right, I'll do that.

2610
03:16:36,167 --> 03:16:48,149
MATT: Probably for the best. For that, you suffer
28 points of bludgeoning damage. As the tail

2611
03:16:48,149 --> 03:16:53,126
swoops down, finding its mark, slamming into you,
sending you against the wall of the stonework, and

2612
03:16:53,126 --> 03:16:57,350
you stumble forward back into place, feeling
already the impact of the bludgeoning wound.

2613
03:16:57,350 --> 03:16:59,671
SAM: That's a four, so.

2614
03:16:59,671 --> 03:17:02,146
MATT: So you reduce that to 24.

2615
03:17:02,146 --> 03:17:05,596
TALIESIN: That halved? No, that's not halved.
Sorry-- brain!

2616
03:17:05,596 --> 03:17:08,665
MATT: So 24 points of bludgeoning damage from the
attack. However, Umbrasyl's next saving throw is

2617
03:17:08,665 --> 03:17:13,515
at a disadvantage because of Mythcarver.
Now, Keyleth, what are you doing?

2618
03:17:13,515 --> 03:17:23,949
MARISHA: Okay. Faerie Fire (poof) right in front
of me. Right on top of him. It gives everybody

2619
03:17:23,949 --> 03:17:25,749
advantage on attacks against him.

2620
03:17:25,749 --> 03:17:27,007
MATT: Yes, it does.

2621
03:17:27,007 --> 03:17:28,316
LAURA: That's great.

2622
03:17:28,316 --> 03:17:31,832
MARISHA: I hope he's got enough hit points to make
it worth it.

2623
03:17:31,832 --> 03:17:34,955
MATT: With disadvantage on the saving throw.

2624
03:17:34,955 --> 03:17:42,207
MARISHA: Yeah, take it, bitch! Glitter bomb! It's
like a Kesha music video.

2625
03:17:42,207 --> 03:17:49,400
MATT: So that's a four plus nine because of the
disadvantage. I rolled a ten and a four. That will

2626
03:17:49,400 --> 03:17:54,791
bring it to 13. It does not succeed. You watch as
a second burst of purplish energy surrounds

2627
03:17:54,791 --> 03:17:58,492
Umbrasyl, radiating a glow.

2628
03:17:58,492 --> 03:18:01,541
CHRIS: Who's the prettiest dragon?

2629
03:18:01,541 --> 03:18:02,995
MARISHA: You're so pretty!

2630
03:18:02,995 --> 03:18:15,464
MATT: Gilmore would love this right now. "Fancy
dragon! Now we're talking!" You went from being

2631
03:18:15,464 --> 03:18:19,225
not able to see the dragon to very much being able
to see the dragon. All right.

2632
03:18:19,225 --> 03:18:24,765
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
into a water elemental.

2633
03:18:24,765 --> 03:18:28,598
MATT: Okay! Look at you being a druid and shit.

2634
03:18:28,598 --> 03:18:31,030
MARISHA: Yeah. That's how I roll.

2635
03:18:31,030 --> 03:18:34,936
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Get it, girl! Get it, get it,
girl!

2636
03:18:34,936 --> 03:18:41,479
MATT: Water elemental Keyleth. Are you going to
stay there?

2637
03:18:41,479 --> 03:18:42,797
MARISHA: Can I move?

2638
03:18:42,797 --> 03:18:44,179
MATT: If you'd like to.

2639
03:18:44,179 --> 03:18:47,320
MARISHA: Am I in his range of attack?

2640
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:51,310
MATT: You gather, yes. Pretty big
range.

2641
03:18:51,310 --> 03:18:56,126
MARISHA: Honestly, Umbrasyl is so fucking big, I
can't see what's going on in front of me.

2642
03:18:56,126 --> 03:18:57,418
MATT: You're right there.

2643
03:18:57,418 --> 03:18:58,821
MARISHA: Is Scanlan in front of me?

2644
03:18:58,821 --> 03:19:00,589
MATT: Scanlan is right next to you, to the right.

2645
03:19:00,589 --> 03:19:04,336
MARISHA: Can I step in the front and shield
Scanlan?

2646
03:19:04,336 --> 03:19:08,621
MATT: Unfortunately, the cliff ends right there.
So you couldn't get in front of Scanlan without

2647
03:19:08,621 --> 03:19:10,329
dropping onto a lower platform.

2648
03:19:10,329 --> 03:19:12,447
MARISHA: What about anybody else?

2649
03:19:12,447 --> 03:19:19,104
MATT: Percy is down there. You could fill some of
Umbrasyl's space but you're not going to be able

2650
03:19:19,104 --> 03:19:24,092
to guard anybody from an attack, unfortunately.
Especially being an entity made of water, not

2651
03:19:24,092 --> 03:19:29,453
a whole lot of defensive strategy in there.

2652
03:19:29,453 --> 03:19:34,767
MARISHA: Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right?
We're all in the shit together?

2653
03:19:34,767 --> 03:19:36,226
MATT: Shale's over here.

2654
03:19:36,226 --> 03:19:37,695
MARISHA: Oh, Shale's over there.

2655
03:19:37,695 --> 03:19:39,049
MATT: Flanking from the side.

2656
03:19:39,049 --> 03:19:47,244
MARISHA: You know what, I'm just going to stay
there!

2657
03:19:47,244 --> 03:19:48,594
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

2658
03:19:48,594 --> 03:19:56,249
TRAVIS: I would like to run along the side of the
pool, and up on his left side, closest to the

2659
03:19:56,249 --> 03:19:59,159
entrance of the cave. Right there would be
delicious.

2660
03:19:59,236 --> 03:20:00,665
MATT: There you go.

2661
03:20:00,665 --> 03:20:09,766
TRAVIS: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. A
regular strike on the first.

2662
03:20:09,766 --> 03:20:12,518
MATT: You already have advantage on all the
attacks because of Faerie Fire. So you don't need--

2663
03:20:12,518 --> 03:20:14,584
TRAVIS: Yeah, not reckless. Not great weapon.

2664
03:20:14,584 --> 03:20:16,314
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

2665
03:20:16,314 --> 03:20:20,112
TALIESIN: Is that a 20?

2666
03:20:20,112 --> 03:20:22,956
ASHLEY: Oh, oh! That would be a natural 20!

2667
03:20:22,956 --> 03:20:26,412
SAM: Oh! That's not going to be good for him.

2668
03:20:26,412 --> 03:20:28,286
MATT: Barbarian crits, man.

2669
03:20:28,286 --> 03:20:29,814
TRAVIS: I keep rolling, yeah?

2670
03:20:29,814 --> 03:20:32,504
MATT: Well, do the damage for the critical, yeah.

2671
03:20:32,504 --> 03:20:39,039
TALIESIN: This and the next round are going to be
really ugly.

2672
03:20:39,039 --> 03:20:43,190
MARISHA: Kill it. Fucking kill it!

2673
03:20:43,190 --> 03:20:45,773
TRAVIS: 24.

2674
03:20:45,773 --> 03:20:47,326
MATT: 24. Okay.

2675
03:20:47,326 --> 03:20:49,811
TRAVIS: Is the roll and then, what? Double it or
add another--?

2676
03:20:49,811 --> 03:20:57,633
MATT: The dice roll is? Well, you roll 1d12. What
was that, the first d12 you rolled?

2677
03:20:57,633 --> 03:21:02,329
TRAVIS: That was a 15. Oh, the dice roll? 12.

2678
03:21:02,329 --> 03:21:04,493
MATT: 12. So make a-- it was a 12?

2679
03:21:04,493 --> 03:21:05,456
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2680
03:21:05,456 --> 03:21:09,371
MATT: Oh, shit! Okay, that's a 24. And then you
add your modifier. And then roll two more d12s.

2681
03:21:09,371 --> 03:21:12,855
So, that's 24 plus, is that seven?

2682
03:21:12,855 --> 03:21:14,314
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2683
03:21:14,314 --> 03:21:21,955
MATT: Plus the two for the axe. Oh my god! That'll
be at 33. Plus the necrotic-- oh, fuck! And that's

2684
03:21:21,955 --> 03:21:23,054
doubled too.

2685
03:21:23,054 --> 03:21:24,812
TRAVIS: So that's an 11 for the second d12.

2686
03:21:24,812 --> 03:21:27,015
MATT: Okay.

2687
03:21:27,015 --> 03:21:28,887
LAURA: Should we write these numbers down?

2688
03:21:28,887 --> 03:21:35,622
MATT: Yeah, we have to now. So it's 24 plus two for
the axe, plus seven for the strength.

2689
03:21:35,622 --> 03:21:37,653
TRAVIS: Plus five for the necrotic--

2690
03:21:37,653 --> 03:21:43,397
MATT: Hold on, getting there. We're getting there.
It's getting math crunchy here, guys. So 24 plus

2691
03:21:43,397 --> 03:21:48,527
nine, so that's 33, plus-- the necrotic?

2692
03:21:48,527 --> 03:21:50,114
TRAVIS: Five.

2693
03:21:50,114 --> 03:21:57,924
MATT: Times two, which is ten. That's 43, plus the
two other d12s, which is an 11. So that's 54. Plus

2694
03:21:57,924 --> 03:21:59,396
your last d12.

2695
03:21:59,396 --> 03:22:01,784
TRAVIS: It's a ten.

2696
03:22:01,784 --> 03:22:05,263
MATT: You did 64 points of damage with this one
critical hit.

2697
03:22:05,263 --> 03:22:07,070
ASHLEY: He's a monstah!

2698
03:22:07,070 --> 03:22:08,832
TRAVIS, MARISHA and LAURA: Monstah!

2699
03:22:08,832 --> 03:22:13,459
MATT: All right. So that's your first attack.

2700
03:22:13,459 --> 03:22:14,563
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2701
03:22:14,563 --> 03:22:16,616
CHRIS: Dragon's like, hello!

2702
03:22:16,709 --> 03:22:19,223
MARISHA: Disco dragon!

2703
03:22:19,223 --> 03:22:24,291
TRAVIS: 20.

2704
03:22:24,291 --> 03:22:33,001
MATT: 20. The first strike swings wide and slams
deep into an already open wound left by a rogue

2705
03:22:33,001 --> 03:22:41,082
earlier in the sky. This time, the axe sinks deep
into its body, and Umbrasyl roars out in immense pain.

2706
03:22:41,082 --> 03:22:47,776
You see spittle and blood both being jettisoned
from its mouth under the sheer pain that it's feeling.

2707
03:22:47,776 --> 03:22:52,202
You take the axe, and you push even deeper, and push
even deeper and withdraw. As you do, the blade is

2708
03:22:52,202 --> 03:22:57,807
entirely covered in deep purplish-black dragon
blood. You swing for a second strike. This time

2709
03:22:57,807 --> 03:23:03,630
it puts its claw out and catches the axe in the
middle of the air. You manage to wrench it free

2710
03:23:03,630 --> 03:23:06,430
from its grasp, but it turns its head toward you,
angrily.

2711
03:23:06,430 --> 03:23:08,848
ASHLEY: Can I use War God's Blessing again?

2712
03:23:08,848 --> 03:23:18,378
MATT: That is Channel Divinity? I'll go ahead and
double-check here real fast.

2713
03:23:18,378 --> 03:23:24,008
MARISHA: We also have Heroes' Feast up, by the
way, if that makes any amount of difference.

2714
03:23:24,008 --> 03:23:29,936
MATT: It won't do anything. It helped you with the
temporary hit points, it helped you with--

2715
03:23:29,936 --> 03:23:31,352
SAM, MARISHA and LIAM: Fear?

2716
03:23:31,352 --> 03:23:34,154
MATT: It helped you with the fear-resistance to begin
with. That was a big one.

2717
03:23:34,154 --> 03:23:41,535
Channel Divinity, War God's Blessing and you
can Channel Divinity twice. So you can do it a

2718
03:23:41,535 --> 03:23:46,707
second time, you can. Wait, didn't you use it--
between rests, yeah. You could do it a second time

2719
03:23:46,707 --> 03:23:48,183
if you want to.

2720
03:23:48,183 --> 03:23:49,155
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2721
03:23:49,155 --> 03:23:53,498
MATT: All right. So with that, with a plus ten brings it to
30. So, as Umbrasyl grabs the axe, stopping it in

2722
03:23:53,498 --> 03:24:00,307
mid-air, you just grin, reach forward with the
axe, and push it into its actual claw. Go

2723
03:24:00,307 --> 03:24:02,437
ahead and roll damage.

2724
03:24:02,437 --> 03:24:06,678
TRAVIS: You nasty, boy! 27.

2725
03:24:06,678 --> 03:24:14,533
MATT: 27 points of damage. All right. And do you
want to use your bonus action?

2726
03:24:14,533 --> 03:24:15,373
TRAVIS: I do.

2727
03:24:15,373 --> 03:24:16,495
MATT: Yes, you do.

2728
03:24:16,495 --> 03:24:18,870
TRAVIS: Let's do it great weapon master, just for
kicks.

2729
03:24:18,870 --> 03:24:20,877
MATT: All right.

2730
03:24:20,877 --> 03:24:26,314
TRAVIS: 26 minus five is 21.

2731
03:24:26,314 --> 03:24:32,021
MATT: 21. As you push the blade into Umbrasyl's
hand, (angry snarl) it rears back its head and

2732
03:24:32,021 --> 03:24:36,054
snaps toward you. You duck out of the way, pull
the blade back and go for a third strike. This

2733
03:24:36,054 --> 03:24:42,235
time however, it actually rears its torso up,
putting its claws in the air, and you (slicing)

2734
03:24:42,235 --> 03:24:45,050
find air right beneath it. Does not strike
true.

2735
03:24:45,050 --> 03:24:46,599
TRAVIS: Cool. Good beans.

2736
03:24:46,599 --> 03:24:52,542
MATT: Yeah. That finishes Grog's turn. At the end of
Grog's turn, it's going to use its third legendary

2737
03:24:52,542 --> 03:24:58,407
action to go ahead and make a-- Actually, no, its
going to hold onto that legendary action. All

2738
03:24:58,407 --> 03:25:00,088
right, that brings us to Scanlan.

2739
03:25:00,088 --> 03:25:01,835
SAM: Jesus, it's not dead yet?

2740
03:25:01,835 --> 03:25:05,454
MATT: Scanlan, because you took the tail attack
earlier, I'll have you roll a concentration check

2741
03:25:05,454 --> 03:25:12,008
for Stinking Cloud. You have advantage on it
though, so add your constitution bonus.

2742
03:25:12,008 --> 03:25:14,716
SAM: 20.

2743
03:25:14,716 --> 03:25:16,771
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2744
03:25:16,771 --> 03:25:23,949
SAM: Great. I've got my Stinking Cloud, still. I
would like to move the Stinking Cloud. Oh! No, I

2745
03:25:24,044 --> 03:25:24,991
can't do that.

2746
03:25:24,991 --> 03:25:26,094
MATT: You can.

2747
03:25:26,094 --> 03:25:27,285
SAM: You can move a Stinking Cloud?

2748
03:25:27,285 --> 03:25:28,824
MATT: I think it moves from a short breeze,
actually.

2749
03:25:28,824 --> 03:25:30,069
SAM: Eh, it's fine.

2750
03:25:30,069 --> 03:25:31,804
MATT: Older versions, I think you could.

2751
03:25:31,804 --> 03:25:34,836
SAM: I don't want the Stinking Cloud to move. All
right, he's right on us, he's got a legendary

2752
03:25:34,836 --> 03:25:55,376
action. This is not good. Okay, I will reintroduce
him to Bigby's Hand, (singing) Bigby's Hand! And

2753
03:25:55,376 --> 03:26:04,710
I'm going to use it as an-- Ugh, so weak!
Interposing Hand.

2754
03:26:04,710 --> 03:26:08,054
MATT: Bigby's Interposing Hand, all righty.

2755
03:26:08,054 --> 03:26:09,514
LAURA: What is that?

2756
03:26:09,514 --> 03:26:15,046
SAM: It will block him. It's a talk-to-the-hand
move.

2757
03:26:15,046 --> 03:26:18,875
MATT: The idea is, you can use your bonus action
to set it each turn to what you want it to do. So

2758
03:26:18,875 --> 03:26:23,677
right now, you're having it as an Interposing
Hand. So, yeah. It prevents it from moving--

2759
03:26:23,677 --> 03:26:26,497
SAM: Wait, just moving? It can still attack?

2760
03:26:26,497 --> 03:26:30,832
MATT: The Interposing Hand interposes between you
and a creature you choose until you give it a

2761
03:26:30,832 --> 03:26:35,388
different command. It stays between the two of you,
providing you half-cover against the target.

2762
03:26:35,442 --> 03:26:37,157
So it helps from ranged attacks.

2763
03:26:37,157 --> 03:26:40,933
SAM: Oh. But it won't block an attack. So in
that case, I'll just attack with it.

2764
03:26:40,933 --> 03:26:44,058
MATT: Okay, so you're just going to go and
Clenched Fist?

2765
03:26:44,134 --> 03:26:49,671
SAM: I'm going to try to finger it right in the
hole that I came out of before.

2766
03:26:49,671 --> 03:26:54,080
MATT: Of course you are! Go ahead and make a melee
spell attack.

2767
03:26:54,080 --> 03:26:56,341
SAM: He's the Bigby and the dike!

2768
03:26:56,341 --> 03:26:58,550
MATT: That would be over here

2769
03:26:58,550 --> 03:27:03,016
SAM: What do I roll? d20?

2770
03:27:03,016 --> 03:27:05,268
MATT: d20, add your spell attack modifier.

2771
03:27:05,268 --> 03:27:10,569
SAM: Oh! 27. Oh! With advantage? 27.

2772
03:27:10,569 --> 03:27:18,880
MATT: 27, that hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 force
damage, as Bigby angrily jams the magical finger

2773
03:27:18,880 --> 03:27:20,956
back into the wound.

2774
03:27:20,956 --> 03:27:22,917
ASHLEY: Rage fingering?

2775
03:27:22,917 --> 03:27:26,877
LIAM: This dragon is being violated in so many
ways.

2776
03:27:26,877 --> 03:27:29,772
SAM: It's just ten. 4d8 plus what?

2777
03:27:29,772 --> 03:27:31,990
MATT: It's 4d8 force damage.

2778
03:27:31,990 --> 03:27:33,520
SAM: That's it, ten.

2779
03:27:33,520 --> 03:27:35,014
MATT: Ten points of force damage.

2780
03:27:35,014 --> 03:27:36,204
SAM: Yes.

2781
03:27:36,204 --> 03:27:37,612
LIAM: Not like this!

2782
03:27:37,612 --> 03:27:43,898
MATT: All right, Scanlan, are you going to move or
stay where you are?

2783
03:27:43,898 --> 03:27:49,439
SAM: If I move, he'll kill me, so I won't.
Instead, I will-- where's Vax?

2784
03:27:49,439 --> 03:27:51,054
MATT: Vax is over here.

2785
03:27:51,054 --> 03:27:52,114
SAM: Way over there?!

2786
03:27:52,114 --> 03:27:53,625
LIAM: Playing medic with my sister.

2787
03:27:53,625 --> 03:27:54,708
LAURA: Hey!

2788
03:27:54,708 --> 03:27:55,762
SAM: Jesus.

2789
03:27:55,762 --> 03:28:11,584
Who can I inspire? I guess I'll inspire good
old Shale again. You don't need inspiration,

2790
03:28:11,584 --> 03:28:16,466
you're fine! This is an old lady!

2791
03:28:16,466 --> 03:28:27,817
I'll turn to Shale and say, I don't normally
do this, but I find you so attractive! For an old lady!

2792
03:28:27,817 --> 03:28:32,061
CHRIS: Focus on the dragon!

2793
03:28:32,061 --> 03:28:44,810
SAM: I can't! With your eyes-- eye? Eye so
beautiful! So twinkling when it looks at me! I

2794
03:28:44,810 --> 03:28:47,790
just want you to hold me in your arm tonight!

2795
03:28:47,790 --> 03:28:58,400
(laughter)

2796
03:28:58,400 --> 03:29:01,479
CHRIS: Have you ever had sex?

2797
03:29:01,479 --> 03:29:05,637
(laughter)

2798
03:29:05,637 --> 03:29:06,847
SAM: No!

2799
03:29:06,847 --> 03:29:08,868
TALIESIN: It was just hanging there!

2800
03:29:08,868 --> 03:29:14,986
SAM: Yes, I've had sex, Shale! I have a daughter.

2801
03:29:14,986 --> 03:29:22,349
MATT: He says this as a giant Bigby's Hand is just
(impact sounds) at the side of a giant, black

2802
03:29:22,349 --> 03:29:29,584
dragon. That brings us to the top of the
initiative round. Percy, it's your turn. Oh my god.

2803
03:29:29,584 --> 03:29:32,143
TALIESIN: Okay. How close am I to this dragon?

2804
03:29:32,143 --> 03:29:34,528
MATT: You are about ten feet from it right now.

2805
03:29:34,528 --> 03:29:37,588
TALIESIN: I'm walking right the fuck up to it.

2806
03:29:37,588 --> 03:29:39,987
MATT: Okay, Percy. You walk right up to the
dragon.

2807
03:29:39,987 --> 03:29:48,234
TALIESIN: I'm pulling out the sword. And I'm going
to fucking town, screaming like a little girl the

2808
03:29:48,234 --> 03:29:49,946
entire time.

2809
03:29:49,946 --> 03:29:51,339
MARISHA: Kill it! Advantage!

2810
03:29:51,339 --> 03:29:52,844
TALIESIN: With advantage.

2811
03:29:52,844 --> 03:29:54,495
MARISHA: All day! Advantage all day!

2812
03:29:54,495 --> 03:29:58,321
LAURA: Kill that fucking dragon.

2813
03:29:58,321 --> 03:30:02,013
TALIESIN: 26!

2814
03:30:02,013 --> 03:30:04,079
MATT: 26 hits.

2815
03:30:04,079 --> 03:30:13,733
TALIESIN: All right, first damage. 23 points of
damage.

2816
03:30:13,733 --> 03:30:15,731
MATT: 23 points of damage, all right.

2817
03:30:15,731 --> 03:30:17,751
TALIESIN: For shot number one. Shot number two.

2818
03:30:17,751 --> 03:30:20,133
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies. That's good!

2819
03:30:20,133 --> 03:30:22,416
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2820
03:30:22,416 --> 03:30:27,333
MARISHA: Sorry, excitement.

2821
03:30:27,333 --> 03:30:44,790
TALIESIN: Ten, 16, 16 times two is 32. 39, that's
39 points of damage. Number three! Oh, it gets

2822
03:30:44,790 --> 03:30:51,277
worse. I'm going to die. Okay, I can do better
than that. No, he can't. 22.

2823
03:30:51,277 --> 03:30:54,323
MATT: 22 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2824
03:30:54,323 --> 03:31:02,244
TALIESIN: That's 18 points of slashing damage.

2825
03:31:02,244 --> 03:31:03,923
MATT: All right.

2826
03:31:03,923 --> 03:31:05,911
TALIESIN: Action surge, motherfucker!

2827
03:31:05,911 --> 03:31:07,428
MATT: Go for it.

2828
03:31:07,428 --> 03:31:09,467
CHRIS: Going Ginsu on this dragon.

2829
03:31:09,467 --> 03:31:10,899
MATT: I know, seriously.

2830
03:31:10,899 --> 03:31:23,077
TALIESIN: It is not an awesome hit, it's just a
hit. I'm really excited. 18 points of damage.

2831
03:31:23,077 --> 03:31:24,378
MATT: All right.

2832
03:31:24,378 --> 03:31:25,574
TALIESIN: Shot number two.

2833
03:31:25,574 --> 03:31:26,957
SAM: Oh my god.

2834
03:31:26,957 --> 03:31:28,449
TALIESIN: That's a hit.

2835
03:31:28,449 --> 03:31:32,155
LAURA: Natural 20?

2836
03:31:32,155 --> 03:31:36,275
TALIESIN: Natural 20. This is to make up for all
these fucking ones.

2837
03:31:36,275 --> 03:31:38,873
LAURA: Why doesn't Percy just always attack
melee?

2838
03:31:38,873 --> 03:31:42,782
MARISHA: He's bad at it most of the time.

2839
03:31:42,782 --> 03:31:48,410
TALIESIN: 47 points of damage. Final attack.

2840
03:31:48,410 --> 03:31:49,623
SAM: Wait, what?

2841
03:31:49,623 --> 03:31:51,373
LIAM: How is this possible?

2842
03:31:51,373 --> 03:31:53,942
MARISHA: Because he's a fighter, he gets three
attacks per round.

2843
03:31:53,942 --> 03:32:00,779
TALIESIN: Plus an action surge for a second attack
set of three. So I'm basically going-- Yeah.

2844
03:32:00,779 --> 03:32:02,614
MARISHA: It's like a John Wu film.

2845
03:32:02,614 --> 03:32:12,344
TALIESIN: It's just a fucking John Wu attack. Oh
my god, it hit. Just barely, because it was a one,

2846
03:32:12,344 --> 03:32:22,640
otherwise. And that final hit is-- oh, that's
good. 27 points of damage, and I'm done.

2847
03:32:22,640 --> 03:32:30,269
MATT: As you unload on Umbrasyl, the pent-up anger
and frustration, you start slashing over and over

2848
03:32:30,269 --> 03:32:36,863
again. You guys watch as the blade shines in the
air in the presence of its naturally designed

2849
03:32:36,863 --> 03:32:43,412
enemy. You see at the corners of his outfit
little tufts of dark smoke beginning to appear.

2850
03:32:43,412 --> 03:32:52,961
The scar of Orthax still shows when the fury
builds within Percy. As each blow strikes, cutting

2851
03:32:52,961 --> 03:33:00,293
away hunks and bits of dragon flesh and scale,
Umbrasyl is heavily wounded and looking desperate.

2852
03:33:00,293 --> 03:33:02,813
That ends your turn, I believe?

2853
03:33:02,813 --> 03:33:04,694
LAURA: Oh my god, he's still alive?

2854
03:33:04,694 --> 03:33:07,919
MATT: You guys gave it time to rest.

2855
03:33:07,919 --> 03:33:13,778
TALIESIN: Fuck it, bonus action, I'm putting on
the mask and standing my ground. Fuck it.

2856
03:33:13,778 --> 03:33:16,221
MATT: Amazing what a dragon can do in two hours.

2857
03:33:16,221 --> 03:33:19,463
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm done.

2858
03:33:19,463 --> 03:33:21,717
MATT: All right. Vex.

2859
03:33:21,717 --> 03:33:28,648
LAURA: Hi. Okay. I'm going to--

2860
03:33:28,648 --> 03:33:34,993
MATT: Actually, at the end of Percy's turn, he's
going to use his third legendary action, knowing

2861
03:33:34,993 --> 03:33:38,718
the source of the Faerie Fire and extremely
frustrated by the fact that it has lent to a very

2862
03:33:38,718 --> 03:33:43,743
difficult round, it turns towards the now water
elemental quivering before it, and the tail comes

2863
03:33:43,743 --> 03:33:45,903
down to smash towards your liquid form.

2864
03:33:45,903 --> 03:33:48,141
MARISHA: (burbling)

2865
03:33:48,141 --> 03:33:50,454
MATT: Speaking of natural 20s.

2866
03:33:50,454 --> 03:33:52,334
TALIESIN: It's okay.

2867
03:33:52,334 --> 03:33:54,543
MARISHA: Come on, bitch. Come on.

2868
03:33:54,543 --> 03:34:01,725
TALIESIN: You're fine.

2869
03:34:01,725 --> 03:34:05,290
MARISHA: Totally fine. I'm an elemental for a
reason.

2870
03:34:05,290 --> 03:34:06,880
TALIESIN: You are totally fucking fine.

2871
03:34:06,880 --> 03:34:08,696
MATT: 32 points of bludgeoning damage.

2872
03:34:08,696 --> 03:34:10,143
MARISHA: Halved.

2873
03:34:10,143 --> 03:34:14,995
MATT: Halved, because of your elemental. Does
water elemental have resistance to damage?

2874
03:34:14,995 --> 03:34:20,355
MARISHA: Yeah, it has damage resistance against
acid, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from

2875
03:34:20,355 --> 03:34:21,820
non-magical weapons.

2876
03:34:21,820 --> 03:34:26,430
MATT: All right, so half that. So 32 made to 16.
16 points of bludgeoning damage. I need you to go

2877
03:34:26,430 --> 03:34:28,081
ahead and roll a concentration check.

2878
03:34:28,081 --> 03:34:29,433
MARISHA: What did you say?

2879
03:34:29,433 --> 03:34:32,721
MATT: Roll a concentration check. So roll a d20
and add your constitution modifier.

2880
03:34:32,721 --> 03:34:36,961
TALIESIN: Even if it goes, it was worth it.

2881
03:34:36,961 --> 03:34:45,599
MARISHA: Not bad, not bad. Hang on, sorry. Just my
straight modifier, it's not a save? Okay, 18!

2882
03:34:45,599 --> 03:34:50,685
MATT: You maintain concentration. You needed to
beat the 16.

2883
03:34:50,685 --> 03:34:54,197
MARISHA: Whoa, daddy. All right.

2884
03:34:54,197 --> 03:34:58,106
MATT: Well, half the damage. No, it would've been ten,
actually, because it's half the damage you

2885
03:34:58,106 --> 03:34:58,955
receive.

2886
03:34:58,955 --> 03:35:01,961
MARISHA: Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm
good. I'm golden.

2887
03:35:01,961 --> 03:35:05,732
MATT: All right, cool. So Vex, what are you
doing?

2888
03:35:05,732 --> 03:35:15,476
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Who all is within five feet of
it? Is everybody within five feet of it?

2889
03:35:15,476 --> 03:35:21,225
MATT: A lot of them are. Pretty much the whole
party aside from Pike, you, and your brother.

2890
03:35:21,225 --> 03:35:24,321
LAURA: Then I'm just going to attack it twice.

2891
03:35:24,321 --> 03:35:26,563
TALIESIN: With advantage.

2892
03:35:26,563 --> 03:35:32,784
SAM: Oi, Matt. My Bigby's is concentration, so
that cloud's gone, by the way.

2893
03:35:32,784 --> 03:35:34,861
MATT: Correct, thank you.

2894
03:35:34,861 --> 03:35:41,815
LAURA: 19 plus 12 hits.

2895
03:35:41,815 --> 03:35:43,698
SAM: Did you shoot it in the back?

2896
03:35:43,698 --> 03:35:46,002
MATT: Yes, it does. Go ahead and roll damage.

2897
03:35:46,002 --> 03:35:47,757
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark him?

2898
03:35:47,757 --> 03:35:49,201
MATT: As a bonus action?

2899
03:35:49,201 --> 03:35:50,274
LAURA: Yeah.

2900
03:35:50,274 --> 03:35:53,549
MATT: All right. Good memory on that one.

2901
03:35:53,549 --> 03:36:02,231
LAURA: 19 on the first hit.

2902
03:36:02,231 --> 03:36:05,016
MATT: 19 damage? All right.

2903
03:36:05,016 --> 03:36:13,525
LAURA: Then the second one hits as well, 17 plus
12.

2904
03:36:13,525 --> 03:36:18,150
MATT: Yep. Go ahead and roll damage for the second
hit.

2905
03:36:18,150 --> 03:36:20,065
LAURA: 23.

2906
03:36:20,065 --> 03:36:31,881
MATT: 23. All right. So, ending your turn, comes to
the top of the round. Umbrasyl, now gripping into

2907
03:36:31,881 --> 03:36:47,383
the stone, "I will not fall!" Suddenly, darkness
begins to sweep into the area. In this area, a

2908
03:36:47,383 --> 03:36:55,530
15-foot radius all completely around Umbrasyl, all
of you in this area, your vision goes dark.

2909
03:36:55,530 --> 03:36:57,863
LIAM: Cancels out Faerie Fire and the golden
butt?

2910
03:36:57,863 --> 03:37:00,320
MATT: Cancels out Faerie Fire. This is magical
darkness.

2911
03:37:00,320 --> 03:37:03,139
SAM: It's not a spell, right?

2912
03:37:03,139 --> 03:37:07,965
LIAM: For those of us on the outside, do we see a
bubble of darkness where Key and the others--

2913
03:37:07,965 --> 03:37:09,896
SAM: A spell, Matt?

2914
03:37:09,896 --> 03:37:19,546
MATT: No, this is an effect of the lair. Actually,
Faerie Fire would still affect it if you attacked

2915
03:37:19,546 --> 03:37:23,507
it, per se, but it doesn't reveal its location
currently within the darkness. However, it is

2916
03:37:23,507 --> 03:37:27,517
technically larger than the darkness. Regardless,
all of you guys that are in there, it would negate

2917
03:37:27,517 --> 03:37:31,117
the advantage you would have from Faerie Fire. It
would just be a central attack.

2918
03:37:31,117 --> 03:37:33,823
MARISHA: So it wouldn't give us disadvantage, it
would just be straight rolls?

2919
03:37:33,823 --> 03:37:37,398
MATT: A little bit of it's piercing through,
because it is magic on magic. However, the rest of

2920
03:37:37,398 --> 03:37:41,354
you see most of the party disappear into a giant
sphere of magical darkness that fills the space.

2921
03:37:41,354 --> 03:37:46,670
LAURA: So we on the outside, we can't use Faerie
Fire? It's just a bubble of dark? Or do we see

2922
03:37:46,670 --> 03:37:48,109
Umbrasyl peeking out?

2923
03:37:48,109 --> 03:37:50,042
LIAM: He said he's bigger than the dark, so we see
his head coming out.

2924
03:37:50,042 --> 03:37:58,131
MATT: You see the wings poking out the sides of
it. You still see where he would be. Okay, so with

2925
03:37:58,131 --> 03:38:15,627
that, Umbrasyl is going to go ahead and take a
risk. He's going to lift his wings and head upward

2926
03:38:15,627 --> 03:38:20,308
to move into an advantageous position.

2927
03:38:20,308 --> 03:38:22,327
SAM: No, it's not!

2928
03:38:22,327 --> 03:38:24,165
MARISHA: Come on. Come on, Scanlan.

2929
03:38:24,165 --> 03:38:32,550
SAM: I'm going to say, you leave when Burt
Reynolds says you can fucking leave! And I will

2930
03:38:32,550 --> 03:38:39,007
Bigby's Hand, and I will bring him back down,
because I get a spell on his retreat.

2931
03:38:39,007 --> 03:38:47,398
TALIESIN: I love watching him look at the phone.

2932
03:38:47,398 --> 03:38:51,199
MARISHA: Consult the helix.

2933
03:38:51,199 --> 03:38:56,707
MATT: Unfortunately, you have to be grasping it or
grappling it to attempt to--

2934
03:38:56,707 --> 03:39:05,917
SAM: No, I get a full spell action. It's my lore
feature. I get to cast a brand new fucking spell

2935
03:39:05,917 --> 03:39:07,837
when he lifts off.

2936
03:39:07,837 --> 03:39:09,683
MATT: Which one?

2937
03:39:09,683 --> 03:39:16,846
SAM: College of Lore. If he retreats, I get to
cast a spell. This is the exact same thing that

2938
03:39:16,846 --> 03:39:19,156
happened last time.

2939
03:39:19,156 --> 03:39:42,473
MATT: Trying to remember how this works. College
of Lore. I don't know if it is. Because what you

2940
03:39:42,473 --> 03:39:43,780
do is you grapple--

2941
03:39:43,780 --> 03:39:45,461
SAM: Oh, no, it's a War Caster feature.

2942
03:39:45,461 --> 03:39:47,979
MATT: Oh, War Caster! Thank you, that clarifies
it. I was like, I don't see this in the College of

2943
03:39:47,979 --> 03:39:55,542
Lore! You're confusing me! So as a War Caster,
when a hostile creature's movement provokes an

2944
03:39:55,542 --> 03:39:57,469
opportunity attack from you, you can use your
reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather

2945
03:39:57,469 --> 03:39:59,687
than making an opportunity attack. So yeah, if you
wanted to go ahead and attempt to grapple--

2946
03:39:59,687 --> 03:40:02,258
SAM: I will grapple him and pull him back down.

2947
03:40:02,258 --> 03:40:10,722
MATT: You can totally attempt that. Bigby, go
ahead and make a strength athletics check to beat

2948
03:40:10,722 --> 03:40:18,747
a dragon's strength. Bigby is just slightly under
the strength of the dragon, so let's see. It's a

2949
03:40:18,747 --> 03:40:19,926
roll-off.

2950
03:40:19,926 --> 03:40:28,859
SAM: It's a roll-off! Oh my god. This is a
critical roll. That's a two.

2951
03:40:28,859 --> 03:40:39,025
MATT: It was a 19 on my end. Natural 19. As
Bigby's Hand reaches forward, the angry, wounded,

2952
03:40:39,025 --> 03:40:43,200
frustrated, furious Umbrasyl just kicks the hand
away, pulling up.

2953
03:40:43,200 --> 03:40:45,505
TALIESIN: Do we get an attack of opportunity?

2954
03:40:45,505 --> 03:40:48,348
MATT: Attack of opportunity from you, you, you,
and you.

2955
03:40:48,348 --> 03:40:50,051
MARISHA: Down, bitch, down!

2956
03:40:50,051 --> 03:40:52,747
ASHLEY: And the Spiritual Weapon, right? And the
Spiritual Weapon?

2957
03:40:52,747 --> 03:40:54,533
MATT: No, it does not get attacks of opportunity.

2958
03:40:54,533 --> 03:40:56,492
MARISHA: Without advantage, even though he's
retreating?

2959
03:40:56,492 --> 03:40:58,580
MATT: Without advantage, because of the magical
darkness that has surrounded you guys.

2960
03:40:58,580 --> 03:41:01,795
MARISHA: Even though he's retreating in Faerie
Fire? That doesn't double it?

2961
03:41:01,795 --> 03:41:04,674
MATT: The darkness would give you disadvantage,
the Faerie Fire negates that. I'm letting you do this.

2962
03:41:04,674 --> 03:41:10,403
MARISHA: Okay. Letting you do this! Be thankful of
what you have! 22 exactly.

2963
03:41:10,403 --> 03:41:11,679
MATT: That hits.

2964
03:41:11,679 --> 03:41:13,487
TALIESIN: 20.

2965
03:41:13,487 --> 03:41:15,320
CHRIS: My staff bounces right off.

2966
03:41:15,320 --> 03:41:16,997
MATT: Okay. Grog?

2967
03:41:16,997 --> 03:41:18,197
TRAVIS: 23.

2968
03:41:18,197 --> 03:41:21,314
MATT: All right, so Grog and Keyleth both get a
hit in. Go ahead and roll damage.

2969
03:41:21,314 --> 03:41:32,209
MARISHA: Shit. Balls. Low. Shit. Eight damage from
the elemental.

2970
03:41:32,209 --> 03:41:34,059
TRAVIS: 20.

2971
03:41:34,059 --> 03:41:37,206
MATT: 20, all right.

2972
03:41:37,206 --> 03:41:42,803
TRAVIS: 25. Plus the necrotic.

2973
03:41:42,803 --> 03:41:44,440
MATT: Good to know.

2974
03:41:44,440 --> 03:41:49,098
MARISHA: And we decided I don't get my fire hands
when I'm a water elemental?

2975
03:41:49,098 --> 03:41:50,632
MATT: Because that's bullshit.

2976
03:41:50,632 --> 03:41:52,133
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

2977
03:41:52,133 --> 03:41:54,289
TALIESIN: That would just be steam.

2978
03:41:54,289 --> 03:42:00,245
MATT: So as you swing out, you arc, and the axe
strikes across the back of Umbrasyl's hide. You

2979
03:42:00,245 --> 03:42:09,323
slam with your water elemental form. The flight is
staggered, and barely lands on his feet. Umbrasyl,

2980
03:42:09,323 --> 03:42:17,128
"I will take you all down!" Unleashes.

2981
03:42:17,128 --> 03:42:19,592
MARISHA: Here it comes.

2982
03:42:19,592 --> 03:42:26,556
MATT: I need a dexterity saving throw from Shale,
Percy, Keyleth, and Scanlan.

2983
03:42:26,556 --> 03:42:29,380
LAURA: Oh, it's that whole table!

2984
03:42:29,380 --> 03:42:33,672
SAM: Seven!

2985
03:42:33,672 --> 03:42:35,263
CHRIS: 24.

2986
03:42:35,263 --> 03:42:36,295
MARISHA: 12.

2987
03:42:36,295 --> 03:42:37,486
TALIESIN: 18.

2988
03:42:37,486 --> 03:42:43,011
MATT: All right. Shale actually succeeded on that
one. DC 23.

2989
03:42:43,011 --> 03:42:44,980
MARISHA: DC 23!

2990
03:42:44,980 --> 03:42:53,257
MATT: So you take half damage on that one. That's
going to be, doing the dice rolls here. So that's

2991
03:42:53,257 --> 03:43:02,403
62 points of acid damage down to 31 to Shale, and
31 to you because you're resistant. So 62 points

2992
03:43:02,403 --> 03:43:04,186
of acid damage to both of you guys.

2993
03:43:04,186 --> 03:43:05,625
SAM: My armor, does that do anything?

2994
03:43:05,625 --> 03:43:07,181
MATT: Your armor takes it by half, so you would
take 31.

2995
03:43:07,181 --> 03:43:08,765
TALIESIN: 62? Okay.

2996
03:43:08,765 --> 03:43:16,977
CHRIS: Cursed lizard, we're going to give all your
treasure to the poor!

2997
03:43:16,977 --> 03:43:22,943
MATT: And with that, it takes the rest of its
action to move further back at its 80 foot flight,

2998
03:43:22,943 --> 03:43:26,365
and it's going to end up right about there.

2999
03:43:26,365 --> 03:43:31,143
SAM: It's too big to fit in its own house.

3000
03:43:31,143 --> 03:43:38,055
MATT: I know! Leaving the Spiritual Weapon there.
All right, that's going to end its turn. That now

3001
03:43:38,055 --> 03:43:40,143
brings it to Vax.

3002
03:43:40,143 --> 03:43:44,736
LIAM: The twins still have advantage because it's
got the Faerie Fire on it, right? You said

3003
03:43:44,736 --> 03:43:46,076
everyone in it?

3004
03:43:46,076 --> 03:43:48,924
MATT: Oh, you need to make a concentration check,
by the way, from the damage you just took.

3005
03:43:48,924 --> 03:43:51,151
MARISHA: Did he get out of the darkness?

3006
03:43:51,151 --> 03:43:52,810
MATT: He did.

3007
03:43:52,810 --> 03:44:00,854
MARISHA: Ooh, ouch, not good at all. What am I
making, just a constitution check?

3008
03:44:00,854 --> 03:44:03,004
MATT: Add your constitution modifier.

3009
03:44:03,004 --> 03:44:07,577
MARISHA: I don't think it's going to be enough.
Eight.

3010
03:44:07,577 --> 03:44:13,250
MATT: The Faerie Fire fades as the acid consumes
you, no longer affected by it.

3011
03:44:13,250 --> 03:44:14,700
MARISHA: Shit.

3012
03:44:14,700 --> 03:44:20,702
MATT: All right. Vax, it's your turn. To answer
your question, no.

3013
03:44:20,702 --> 03:44:22,304
LIAM: Nobody's near it anymore, right?

3014
03:44:22,304 --> 03:44:23,639
MATT: Nope.

3015
03:44:23,639 --> 03:44:32,041
LIAM: Okay. I would like to scrabble up behind it,
as close to its treasure pile as I can get.

3016
03:44:32,041 --> 03:44:36,899
MATT: Okay, that would be about there.

3017
03:44:36,899 --> 03:44:52,585
LIAM: And I'm going to throw. Shit. No, cancel
that. I'd like to run up its tail.

3018
03:44:52,585 --> 03:45:02,044
MATT: Okay. You go rushing, clambering onto the
back of its tail. It swoops around and sees you

3019
03:45:02,044 --> 03:45:04,924
doing so, but you're already quick and on it. What
are you going to do?

3020
03:45:04,924 --> 03:45:10,302
LIAM: I'm going to hold my action until somebody
gets up on this motherfucker, and as soon as

3021
03:45:10,302 --> 03:45:13,445
somebody gets close and catches his attention I'm
going to stab into it.

3022
03:45:13,445 --> 03:45:18,061
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that takes
the end of Vax's turn. Shale, you're up.

3023
03:45:18,061 --> 03:45:21,340
CHRIS: I stride up to the dragon and smack it on
the nose.

3024
03:45:21,340 --> 03:45:23,559
TRAVIS: Atta girl, Shale!

3025
03:45:23,559 --> 03:45:25,506
MATT: Speed of 20 feet, you said?

3026
03:45:25,506 --> 03:45:28,295
CHRIS: Yeah.

3027
03:45:28,295 --> 03:45:32,662
MATT: You can't quite get to it, unfortunately.
That's about as far as you can move this turn. You

3028
03:45:32,741 --> 03:45:35,856
can dash if you want to, but even so, you still
can't quite get to it.

3029
03:45:35,856 --> 03:45:44,924
CHRIS: All right then. I will use all my action to
get as close to it as I can.

3030
03:45:44,924 --> 03:45:49,677
MATT: Okay, there we go. All right! Ending Shale's
turn. Pike, you're up.

3031
03:45:49,677 --> 03:45:56,142
ASHLEY: Okay. I didn't realize I was up so
quickly. All right.

3032
03:45:56,142 --> 03:45:58,853
CHRIS: Although, actually, I have action surge.

3033
03:45:58,853 --> 03:46:00,153
MATT: You do, actually.

3034
03:46:00,153 --> 03:46:01,804
CHRIS: So I will then whack him on the nose.

3035
03:46:01,804 --> 03:46:02,922
MATT: That's true.

3036
03:46:02,922 --> 03:46:03,962
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

3037
03:46:03,962 --> 03:46:05,885
CHRIS: All right, so that's going to be--

3038
03:46:05,885 --> 03:46:07,533
TALIESIN: I have 13 hit points.

3039
03:46:07,533 --> 03:46:09,937
SAM: 13?

3040
03:46:09,937 --> 03:46:13,045
I thought that said 93.

3041
03:46:13,045 --> 03:46:14,414
TALIESIN: I count up.

3042
03:46:14,414 --> 03:46:15,536
CHRIS: 22.

3043
03:46:15,536 --> 03:46:17,436
MATT: 22, that just barely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

3044
03:46:17,436 --> 03:46:21,338
CHRIS: So I whack it for nine.

3045
03:46:21,338 --> 03:46:23,293
MATT: Nine points of damage, got it.

3046
03:46:23,293 --> 03:46:29,319
LIAM: I'm above it. Do I get advantage for that?

3047
03:46:29,319 --> 03:46:34,155
MATT: Technically, because you are behind, you are
flanking it, so as we'll use the flanking rules

3048
03:46:34,155 --> 03:46:36,260
for this, you do have advantage on the attack.

3049
03:46:36,260 --> 03:46:41,911
LIAM: Okay, so, good. 29.

3050
03:46:41,911 --> 03:46:44,718
MATT: 29 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with sneak
attack.

3051
03:46:44,718 --> 03:46:50,974
LIAM: 24.

3052
03:46:50,974 --> 03:46:53,274
MATT: 24, all righty.

3053
03:46:53,274 --> 03:46:57,761
LIAM: And is the bonus action gone because of
holding the action?

3054
03:46:57,761 --> 03:46:59,895
MATT: Correct, yeah, you just get the one action
to hold.

3055
03:46:59,895 --> 03:47:05,741
LIAM: Add one point to that. It was the keen
dagger.

3056
03:47:05,741 --> 03:47:09,907
MATT: So as part of your action surge, you get two
more attacks.

3057
03:47:09,907 --> 03:47:13,791
LIAM: I didn't add the damage! Add eight to that.
Not one, add eight to that. Sorry.

3058
03:47:13,791 --> 03:47:20,028
SAM: Add seven more. Then add three.

3059
03:47:20,028 --> 03:47:23,884
CHRIS: Nope, and nope.

3060
03:47:23,884 --> 03:47:26,456
SAM: You have inspiration!

3061
03:47:26,456 --> 03:47:28,083
CHRIS: I used it already.

3062
03:47:28,083 --> 03:47:29,405
SAM: Goddamn it!

3063
03:47:29,405 --> 03:47:31,208
CHRIS: But thank you, it was very helpful.

3064
03:47:31,208 --> 03:47:32,803
SAM: You're useless!

3065
03:47:32,803 --> 03:47:36,099
CHRIS: A fickle lover.

3066
03:47:36,099 --> 03:47:43,664
MATT: The one hit, it snorts in reaction to it. As
it pulls back, you swing twice more, pretty sure

3067
03:47:43,664 --> 03:47:47,792
the head was in the same place it was going to be,
but unfortunately, meet air. Curse your sight!

3068
03:47:47,792 --> 03:47:50,302
CHRIS: He had a bit of an itch on his back, that's
what it was.

3069
03:47:50,302 --> 03:47:55,698
MATT: Caught the attention. All right, that brings
us to Pike. What are you doing?

3070
03:47:55,698 --> 03:48:06,580
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing over
to everybody over there. So, Keyleth, Percy,

3071
03:48:06,580 --> 03:48:10,349
Scanlan, Shale.

3072
03:48:10,349 --> 03:48:14,933
MARISHA: Awesome. I'm into this.

3073
03:48:14,933 --> 03:48:17,314
CHRIS: I'm sort of right under the dragon. I'm
actually quite far.

3074
03:48:17,314 --> 03:48:19,947
ASHLEY: Yeah, she's gone. Who's that down there?
That's you, Percy, right?

3075
03:48:19,947 --> 03:48:21,550
TALIESIN: Trinket.

3076
03:48:21,550 --> 03:48:24,202
MATT: What level is Prayer of Healing?

3077
03:48:24,202 --> 03:48:28,435
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at fifth level. It's a
second level, but I'm going to do it at fifth level.

3078
03:48:28,435 --> 03:48:33,706
MATT: Within 30 feet of you, so five, ten, 15, 20,
25, 30.

3079
03:48:33,706 --> 03:48:35,858
SAM: You can heal my hand.

3080
03:48:35,858 --> 03:48:38,557
LIAM: You could also run closer and do it.

3081
03:48:38,557 --> 03:48:44,221
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, I'll run closer. And I'll run
around, not into the pool of acid death.

3082
03:48:44,221 --> 03:48:46,581
MATT: That's as close as you can get right now.

3083
03:48:46,581 --> 03:48:48,059
SAM: Is that close?

3084
03:48:48,059 --> 03:48:50,256
LIAM: It's close enough for Scanlan.

3085
03:48:50,256 --> 03:48:53,793
MATT: It's enough for Scanlan and Keyleth.

3086
03:48:53,793 --> 03:48:55,289
SAM: Don't do it.

3087
03:48:55,289 --> 03:48:58,755
MARISHA: Percy needs it.

3088
03:48:58,755 --> 03:49:00,766
ASHLEY: Percy needs it?

3089
03:49:00,766 --> 03:49:03,808
MATT: Percy's not in range.

3090
03:49:03,808 --> 03:49:07,149
ASHLEY: Fuck. Can I go the other way around?

3091
03:49:07,149 --> 03:49:08,796
SAM: You can go through the acid.

3092
03:49:08,796 --> 03:49:10,138
TALIESIN: No.

3093
03:49:10,138 --> 03:49:11,712
TRAVIS: It was only 12 points of damage.

3094
03:49:11,712 --> 03:49:17,390
ASHLEY: I don't have a lot left. All right, then.

3095
03:49:17,390 --> 03:49:18,893
TALIESIN: It's okay.

3096
03:49:18,893 --> 03:49:20,525
LIAM: Do what you can.

3097
03:49:20,525 --> 03:49:25,287
ASHLEY: Okay. Fuck. Can I stay where I was at,
then?

3098
03:49:25,287 --> 03:49:29,648
MATT: You can. Stay right there.

3099
03:49:29,648 --> 03:49:33,579
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry, I'm going to not do that. I'm
going to Guiding Bolt then.

3100
03:49:33,579 --> 03:49:44,825
MATT: Okay. You can just barely make out the position
of where Umbrasyl is. You can go ahead and make

3101
03:49:44,825 --> 03:49:48,620
the attack, but it's going to get cover bonus to
the range.

3102
03:49:48,620 --> 03:49:50,523
ASHLEY: Can I peek out? Can I move out?

3103
03:49:50,523 --> 03:49:56,211
MATT: You can move here if you want to, and it'll
help a little bit. It'll only give it a minor

3104
03:49:56,211 --> 03:49:59,056
bonus. Go ahead and make your attack.

3105
03:49:59,056 --> 03:50:01,397
ASHLEY: What's that?

3106
03:50:01,397 --> 03:50:04,459
MATT: Go ahead and make your spell attack. Is this
basic level Guiding Bolt?

3107
03:50:04,459 --> 03:50:06,103
ASHLEY: Basic level Guiding Bolt.

3108
03:50:06,103 --> 03:50:07,390
MATT: Okay.

3109
03:50:07,390 --> 03:50:14,150
ASHLEY: Nope. Doesn't hit.

3110
03:50:14,150 --> 03:50:18,850
MATT: You try and reach around and as it's moving
its wings about, you manage to strike the stone

3111
03:50:18,850 --> 03:50:23,098
just blocking half of its form. It splashes with
energy and dissipates with no effect,

3112
03:50:23,098 --> 03:50:24,096
unfortunately.

3113
03:50:24,096 --> 03:50:25,499
ASHLEY: All right. Can I tuck back in?

3114
03:50:25,499 --> 03:50:26,670
MATT: Yeah.

3115
03:50:26,670 --> 03:50:29,942
ASHLEY: And I'm going to move the Spiritual Weapon
with my bonus attack, or can I not do that?

3116
03:50:29,942 --> 03:50:34,133
MATT: You can do that, yeah. 20 feet? To there.

3117
03:50:34,133 --> 03:50:37,040
ASHLEY: Okay. That's it. That's what I can do.

3118
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:40,315
MATT: Is that as far as you can move it? Spiritual
Weapon can move, I believe it's 20 feet. Yeah,

3119
03:50:40,315 --> 03:50:41,861
that's as far as you can get it.

3120
03:50:41,861 --> 03:50:43,328
ASHLEY: No, 60 feet!

3121
03:50:43,328 --> 03:50:46,851
MATT: The range of the spell is 60 feet, but as a
bonus action, you can move it 20 feet and repeat

3122
03:50:46,851 --> 03:50:48,007
the attack.

3123
03:50:48,007 --> 03:50:49,191
ASHLEY: Oh.

3124
03:50:49,191 --> 03:50:50,720
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

3125
03:50:50,720 --> 03:51:00,457
MARISHA: I'm up? No shit. Wow. Okay. It's really
far away though now, yeah?

3126
03:51:00,457 --> 03:51:01,666
MATT: Yeah.

3127
03:51:01,666 --> 03:51:04,850
MARISHA: Way more than 30 feet, right?

3128
03:51:04,850 --> 03:51:06,545
MATT: Yep.

3129
03:51:06,545 --> 03:51:13,916
MARISHA: What is he? How far away is he from me?

3130
03:51:13,916 --> 03:51:15,657
MATT: You're not sure.

3131
03:51:15,657 --> 03:51:19,246
LIAM: He's about 40 or 50 feet or something.

3132
03:51:19,246 --> 03:51:23,117
MARISHA: Yeah. You're holding your action for
someone to get up close.

3133
03:51:23,117 --> 03:51:24,484
LAURA: He already did it.

3134
03:51:24,484 --> 03:51:42,217
MARISHA: Oh, you already did it. Yeah, I guess I'm
going to dash and see if I can get to him.

3135
03:51:42,217 --> 03:51:45,213
MATT: Okay, what's your movement as a water
elemental?

3136
03:51:45,213 --> 03:51:47,039
MARISHA: 30 feet.

3137
03:51:47,039 --> 03:52:06,435
MATT: 30 feet. 60, you're so close. Fucking dragon
wings. There you go, you're so close. We'll say

3138
03:52:06,435 --> 03:52:09,515
you're there, that's fine. That ends your turn,
Keyleth?

3139
03:52:09,515 --> 03:52:10,877
MARISHA: I guess so.

3140
03:52:10,877 --> 03:52:12,706
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

3141
03:52:12,706 --> 03:52:22,783
TRAVIS: I would like to stride over to Bigby's
Hand, and can I take out a level-- It's not level

3142
03:52:22,783 --> 03:52:26,131
two, what do you call it? Not superior, but the
middle one.

3143
03:52:26,131 --> 03:52:27,307
SAM: Moderate?

3144
03:52:27,307 --> 03:52:29,039
TRAVIS: Can I take a moderate healing potion?

3145
03:52:29,039 --> 03:52:32,938
MATT: There's healing and then greater healing, so
I imagine it would probably be greater healing.

3146
03:52:32,938 --> 03:52:36,251
TRAVIS: Can I take the greater healing potion and
chuck it to Percy?

3147
03:52:36,251 --> 03:52:37,660
MATT: Yeah.

3148
03:52:37,660 --> 03:52:40,104
TRAVIS: Just a toss while standing at Bigby's
Hand?

3149
03:52:40,104 --> 03:52:43,761
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw to catch the tossed potion at that

3150
03:52:43,761 --> 03:52:44,833
distance.

3151
03:52:44,833 --> 03:52:46,082
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3152
03:52:46,082 --> 03:52:48,119
MATT: You don't even look.

3153
03:52:48,119 --> 03:52:53,141
TRAVIS: And I will hold my attack.

3154
03:52:53,141 --> 03:52:54,962
MATT: You can keep moving if you want.

3155
03:52:54,962 --> 03:52:59,715
TRAVIS: I want to stay right by Bigby's Hand. I'll
hold my attack until Bigby's Hand twitches.

3156
03:52:59,715 --> 03:53:03,617
MATT: All right. Finishing Grog's turn, Scanlan,
you're up.

3157
03:53:03,617 --> 03:53:11,823
SAM: I will inspire Grog with a little ditty that
I like to call, Who Let the Grogs Out?

3158
03:53:11,823 --> 03:53:13,541
ALL: Who? Who who who who?

3159
03:53:13,541 --> 03:53:15,108
SAM: Who let the Grogs out?

3160
03:53:15,108 --> 03:53:16,802
ALL: Who? Who who who who?

3161
03:53:16,802 --> 03:53:24,200
MATT: I'm conflicted in giving that inspiration.
Take it, it's fine.

3162
03:53:24,200 --> 03:53:27,893
SAM: I can try a different one, if you'd like.

3163
03:53:27,893 --> 03:53:30,244
MATT: No, it's perfect.

3164
03:53:30,244 --> 03:53:35,968
SAM: And I will pick him up, with his blessing.

3165
03:53:35,968 --> 03:53:37,528
TRAVIS: Please.

3166
03:53:37,528 --> 03:53:39,566
SAM: And throw him at the dragon.

3167
03:53:39,566 --> 03:53:41,575
MATT: Throw?

3168
03:53:41,575 --> 03:53:43,865
SAM: Or, you know, send him.

3169
03:53:43,865 --> 03:53:47,052
MATT: Okay, so Bigby's Hand will move with you 60
feet.

3170
03:53:47,052 --> 03:53:49,761
SAM: You want to go up to his head?

3171
03:53:49,761 --> 03:53:51,246
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3172
03:53:51,246 --> 03:53:53,185
SAM: All right, yeah. He's going up top.

3173
03:53:53,185 --> 03:53:57,055
MATT: Okay. We'll go ahead and use some of the
platforms today.

3174
03:53:57,055 --> 03:54:03,857
LAURA: Yeah! Cut his horns off!

3175
03:54:03,857 --> 03:54:05,091
LIAM: Don't land on me.

3176
03:54:05,091 --> 03:54:06,806
ASHLEY: Kill him!

3177
03:54:06,806 --> 03:54:08,549
LAURA: Cut his wings off!

3178
03:54:08,549 --> 03:54:11,260
ASHLEY: Tear his head off!

3179
03:54:11,260 --> 03:54:13,106
LAURA: Jump off those head things!

3180
03:54:13,106 --> 03:54:15,213
TALIESIN: We have done a lot of damage to this
thing.

3181
03:54:15,213 --> 03:54:20,514
MATT: Problem with leaving it to heal, man.

3182
03:54:20,514 --> 03:54:23,945
SAM: He's only got 400 hit points left.

3183
03:54:23,945 --> 03:54:26,833
LAURA: He's looking rough.

3184
03:54:26,833 --> 03:54:34,385
MATT: Should be more like there, we'll say.

3185
03:54:34,385 --> 03:54:39,671
SAM: Release the hounds.

3186
03:54:39,671 --> 03:54:42,133
TRAVIS: Can I make two reckless attacks?

3187
03:54:42,133 --> 03:54:43,574
MATT: You may.

3188
03:54:43,574 --> 03:54:44,883
LAURA: Reckless?

3189
03:54:44,883 --> 03:54:58,225
TRAVIS: Yes, reckless. I'll use the inspiration
die. That's a ten, so that's a 29.

3190
03:54:58,225 --> 03:54:59,500
MATT: 29 hits.

3191
03:54:59,500 --> 03:55:01,271
SAM: Yeah! That helped.

3192
03:55:01,271 --> 03:55:05,470
TRAVIS: 23.

3193
03:55:05,470 --> 03:55:07,079
LAURA: Plus necrotic.

3194
03:55:07,079 --> 03:55:09,712
TRAVIS: 26.

3195
03:55:09,712 --> 03:55:13,119
MATT: 26, got it. All right, second attack.

3196
03:55:13,119 --> 03:55:19,677
TRAVIS: 24.

3197
03:55:19,677 --> 03:55:22,424
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

3198
03:55:22,424 --> 03:55:26,729
TRAVIS: 24.

3199
03:55:26,729 --> 03:55:28,506
LAURA: Plus necrotic.

3200
03:55:28,506 --> 03:55:33,482
TRAVIS: Thank you. 29. I'm not used to that.

3201
03:55:33,482 --> 03:55:38,648
MATT: All right. As Bigby's Hand lifts you up, you
reach out and swing with the axe, one hit, a second

3202
03:55:38,648 --> 03:55:43,688
hit, both streaking across the face, the second
one actually cutting through one of the eyes. The

3203
03:55:43,688 --> 03:55:50,352
eye bursts against the blade of bloodaxe, and you
can see now the fluids and material that once were

3204
03:55:50,352 --> 03:55:53,191
contained within are now spilling down the side of
Umbrasyl's face.

3205
03:55:53,191 --> 03:55:57,764
TRAVIS: Ain't you pretty?

3206
03:55:57,764 --> 03:56:01,856
MATT: All right, Scanlan.

3207
03:56:01,856 --> 03:56:03,564
SAM: What, me?

3208
03:56:03,564 --> 03:56:05,316
MATT: That was your bonus action.

3209
03:56:05,316 --> 03:56:17,804
SAM: Oh! Well, okay. I didn't know that. I will
try something else then. I will send-- shit. I

3210
03:56:17,804 --> 03:56:25,972
will send my Lightning Bolt. Can I see any part of
him that's not inhabited by one of my allies?

3211
03:56:25,972 --> 03:56:28,544
MATT: I'd say there's an arc you could probably
hit, yeah.

3212
03:56:28,544 --> 03:56:29,895
SAM: Right in the heart?

3213
03:56:29,895 --> 03:56:32,354
MATT: Sure. The heart region of the dragon.

3214
03:56:32,354 --> 03:56:36,853
SAM: I'm going to shoot him right through the
heart with lightning.

3215
03:56:36,853 --> 03:56:46,194
MATT: All right. That is a dexterity 21 save, so
I'm pretty sure it's halved.

3216
03:56:46,194 --> 03:56:47,603
SAM: Yeah, that saves.

3217
03:56:47,603 --> 03:56:49,508
MATT: Go ahead and roll 8d6, half damage.

3218
03:56:49,508 --> 03:56:52,156
LIAM: Shot through the heart!

3219
03:56:52,156 --> 03:56:54,901
SAM: I don't know that
song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that

3220
03:56:54,901 --> 03:57:03,038
song. 24, so just 12.

3221
03:57:03,038 --> 03:57:12,542
MATT: 12 points of lightning damage. All right.
The bolt of lightning bursts through the body. All

3222
03:57:12,542 --> 03:57:19,895
righty. That comes to the top of the round. At the
end of Scanlan's turn, it's going to use a

3223
03:57:19,895 --> 03:57:28,910
legendary action to strike down, with the tail,
onto Vax behind, as you are already in that

3224
03:57:28,910 --> 03:57:30,083
vicinity.

3225
03:57:30,083 --> 03:57:31,402
LIAM: Dex save?

3226
03:57:31,402 --> 03:57:34,768
MATT: No, this is instead going to be a 26 to
hit.

3227
03:57:34,768 --> 03:57:39,557
LIAM: Yeah, that-- oh, displacer cloak. Did you do
that at disadvantage?

3228
03:57:39,557 --> 03:57:43,092
MATT: That is instead a 24 to hit.

3229
03:57:43,092 --> 03:57:45,427
LIAM: That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge,
though.

3230
03:57:45,427 --> 03:57:55,870
MATT: All right. So what would be 18 damage, you
take nine instead from the tail. Percy.

3231
03:57:55,870 --> 03:58:04,219
TALIESIN: I'm going to take three shots from where
I'm at. First, I'm going to use my bonus action to

3232
03:58:04,219 --> 03:58:10,358
chug down that potion I just got. What's the
superior worth?

3233
03:58:10,358 --> 03:58:11,837
SAM: Greater.

3234
03:58:11,837 --> 03:58:13,820
MATT: It's a greater, yes. 4d4 plus four.

3235
03:58:13,820 --> 03:58:29,792
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four. Where are my d4s at? I'll
just do this four times. 13 points up, so that's a

3236
03:58:29,792 --> 03:58:42,492
little bit better. All right, I'm going to take
shot number one. I'm going to do a called shot to

3237
03:58:42,492 --> 03:58:50,695
the face. I'm going to hit his other eye. Come on.
Natural 20.

3238
03:58:50,695 --> 03:58:53,246
SAM: I feel like we need to retire the dice.

3239
03:58:53,246 --> 03:58:55,414
TALIESIN: Fuck no! No, I love this die.

3240
03:58:55,414 --> 03:58:57,285
MARISHA: You witnessed it!

3241
03:58:57,285 --> 03:58:58,558
CHRIS: Yeah!

3242
03:58:58,558 --> 03:59:00,288
MARISHA: You're a third party, it's good.

3243
03:59:00,288 --> 03:59:04,122
TRAVIS: Have you and Wheaton ever touched?

3244
03:59:04,122 --> 03:59:09,900
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I had a really bad day
afterward. Let me tell you. That didn't turn out

3245
03:59:09,900 --> 03:59:24,304
too well. That's just 16 points of damage, and I
don't think I get anything bonus for this, he has

3246
03:59:24,304 --> 03:59:26,230
to make a constitution saving throw.

3247
03:59:26,230 --> 03:59:28,040
CHRIS: Eyeball saving throw.

3248
03:59:28,040 --> 03:59:32,709
TALIESIN: Or he's going to have disadvantage on
all of his attacks for the next turn.

3249
03:59:32,709 --> 03:59:38,551
MATT: Okay, that is nine plus 14, 23.

3250
03:59:38,551 --> 03:59:40,080
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, he's fine.

3251
03:59:40,080 --> 03:59:41,397
MATT: Dragons.

3252
03:59:41,397 --> 03:59:46,513
TALIESIN: I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going
to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to

3253
03:59:46,513 --> 03:59:51,003
go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit
more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another

3254
03:59:51,003 --> 03:59:52,300
grit and get advantage on it.

3255
03:59:52,300 --> 03:59:53,510
MATT: Okay.

3256
03:59:53,510 --> 04:00:01,192
TALIESIN: So advantage sharpshooter. And that's a
good thing, because that was terrible. And that

3257
04:00:01,192 --> 04:00:03,625
was also terrible. So I miss.

3258
04:00:03,625 --> 04:00:09,571
MATT: All right, second shot. The first one (boom)
slams and blasts near the ocular socket of

3259
04:00:09,571 --> 04:00:14,651
Umbrasyl, shattering the bone, but not actually
damaging the eye. The second shot manages to go

3260
04:00:14,651 --> 04:00:18,929
through the wing, but unfortunately, the area was
already damaged, and it's minimal in the effect on

3261
04:00:18,929 --> 04:00:20,527
the dragon. Third strike?

3262
04:00:20,527 --> 04:00:26,847
TALIESIN: Yeah, third strike. Here we go.
Actually, you know what, I'm going to go for

3263
04:00:26,847 --> 04:00:29,783
advantage. I'm going to go for sharpshooter
advantage one more time, just for shits and

3264
04:00:29,783 --> 04:00:37,994
giggles. Jesus. Do I call it?

3265
04:00:37,994 --> 04:00:40,192
MATT: It fell to the table.

3266
04:00:40,192 --> 04:00:41,739
TALIESIN: So, yeah, I miss.

3267
04:00:41,739 --> 04:00:43,663
MATT: Two other shots, unfortunately, (bang).

3268
04:00:43,663 --> 04:00:50,279
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide. I'm going to pull top
right, and go up. I'm going up and I'm getting the

3269
04:00:50,279 --> 04:00:52,631
fuck back there, as far back as I can get.

3270
04:00:52,631 --> 04:00:58,014
MATT: Okay. End of Percy's turn, going to use
another legendary action to slam with the tail

3271
04:00:58,014 --> 04:01:02,128
once again towards you, Vax. This is going to
be--

3272
04:01:02,128 --> 04:01:05,110
LIAM: This is in the same round, so there's no
more disadvantage.

3273
04:01:05,110 --> 04:01:07,581
MATT: Correct. 25?

3274
04:01:07,581 --> 04:01:13,257
LIAM: Sure. And do I blow Uncanny Dodge now?

3275
04:01:13,257 --> 04:01:23,712
MATT: You only get one reaction, so yeah. That's
going to be 22 points of bludgeoning damage.

3276
04:01:23,712 --> 04:01:28,677
Whack! The tail comes down and slams into you,
putting you face-first into the stone. You can

3277
04:01:28,677 --> 04:01:33,699
feel the blood run from your nose from the impact
as the tail picks back up again. Vex, you're up.

3278
04:01:33,699 --> 04:01:40,791
LAURA: I'm going to attack him a couple times. How
about that? No advantage anymore, though, huh?

3279
04:01:40,791 --> 04:01:43,068
MARISHA: No, it failed.

3280
04:01:43,068 --> 04:01:46,040
LAURA: 18 on the first one doesn't hit.

3281
04:01:46,040 --> 04:01:48,699
MATT: Arrow just splinters across the dragon's
hide.

3282
04:01:48,699 --> 04:01:53,869
LAURA: That first one was way better, I should've
kept it!

3283
04:01:53,869 --> 04:01:57,390
MATT: What was the second one?

3284
04:01:57,390 --> 04:01:59,259
LAURA: The second one was 16.

3285
04:01:59,259 --> 04:02:03,514
MATT: 16, the second arrow strikes the side of
Umbrasyl's face. Unfortunately, once again, the

3286
04:02:03,514 --> 04:02:10,141
wood shaft streaks across, broken and destroyed by
the impact. That ends your turn.

3287
04:02:10,141 --> 04:02:15,926
LAURA: No, I still have a bonus action, so I'm
going to hide with my bonus action.

3288
04:02:15,926 --> 04:02:21,845
MATT: Okay, you can do that, roll stealth. Did you
add sneak attack? Oh, no, because nothing hit.

3289
04:02:21,845 --> 04:02:23,045
Sorry.

3290
04:02:23,045 --> 04:02:24,188
LAURA: Really?

3291
04:02:24,188 --> 04:02:25,510
MATT: Sorry, I was trying to be mindful.

3292
04:02:25,510 --> 04:02:27,044
LAURA: Did you really just do that?

3293
04:02:27,044 --> 04:02:29,979
MATT: Trying to help. Failing miserably, but
trying.

3294
04:02:29,979 --> 04:02:32,376
LAURA: Do I still have Pass Without Trace?

3295
04:02:32,376 --> 04:02:35,260
MATT: No. Hunter's Mark got rid of that.

3296
04:02:35,260 --> 04:02:36,479
LAURA: 20.

3297
04:02:36,479 --> 04:02:50,865
MATT: Okay, good to know. Top of the round.
Magical darkness fills this entire sphere once

3298
04:02:50,865 --> 04:02:59,983
more, encapsulating Grog, Vax, and everybody else
in the area of the dragon. Vision is taken. You

3299
04:02:59,983 --> 04:03:02,966
are all considered blind and have disadvantage on
any attack rolls.

3300
04:03:02,966 --> 04:03:05,025
LAURA: Who all?

3301
04:03:05,025 --> 04:03:08,162
MATT: Dragon does not seem to be--

3302
04:03:08,162 --> 04:03:10,957
LIAM: And is it we're blinded, or we're blind
where we are?

3303
04:03:10,957 --> 04:03:12,988
MATT: Blind where you are.

3304
04:03:12,988 --> 04:03:14,766
TRAVIS: Dragon does not seem to be--?

3305
04:03:14,766 --> 04:03:16,747
MATT: Affected by it.

3306
04:03:16,747 --> 04:03:22,025
LAURA: I'm not affected by that, though, because
I'm outside of the bubble?

3307
04:03:22,025 --> 04:03:26,356
MATT: Correct, yes. Actually, let me see
something.

3308
04:03:26,356 --> 04:03:30,681
TRAVIS: That dumb grin.

3309
04:03:30,681 --> 04:03:37,059
MATT: With a five. Yep.

3310
04:03:37,059 --> 04:03:39,135
MARISHA: Breath recharged.

3311
04:03:39,135 --> 04:03:48,562
MATT: Umbrasyl is going to turn up towards you,
Grog. The head peeks out of the darkness for a

3312
04:03:48,562 --> 04:03:59,694
second, right before it fills your space, and it
just says, "I will finish this." You hear a

3313
04:03:59,694 --> 04:04:06,287
familiar sound of gurgling, and then (liquid
spray) out another time. This is going to go for

3314
04:04:06,287 --> 04:04:12,919
everything in that vicinity. That's going to be
Keyleth, Shale, Grog, Trinket, and Percy.

3315
04:04:12,919 --> 04:04:14,505
TALIESIN: Did I not get cover?

3316
04:04:14,505 --> 04:04:20,437
MATT: You couldn't move that far, unfortunately.
That's as far as you could go with your movement.

3317
04:04:20,437 --> 04:04:22,008
TALIESIN: Okay.

3318
04:04:22,008 --> 04:04:28,204
MATT: So I need a dexterity saving throw from all
of you guys.

3319
04:04:28,204 --> 04:04:30,361
MARISHA: Fuck.

3320
04:04:30,361 --> 04:04:38,041
TALIESIN: Blowing my last reroll. That's better.

3321
04:04:38,041 --> 04:04:42,691
MARISHA: It's like a 23 save, right?

3322
04:04:42,691 --> 04:04:44,960
MATT: Yeah.

3323
04:04:44,960 --> 04:04:48,067
TALIESIN: Fuck no. I mean, I rolled good, but--

3324
04:04:48,067 --> 04:04:49,820
MARISHA: But it doesn't matter.

3325
04:04:49,820 --> 04:04:51,002
TRAVIS: 18.

3326
04:04:51,002 --> 04:04:52,328
CHRIS: Ten.

3327
04:04:52,328 --> 04:04:54,077
MARISHA: Six.

3328
04:04:54,077 --> 04:05:00,771
TALIESIN: That's 20.

3329
04:05:00,771 --> 04:05:03,647
MATT: And Trinket? Oh.

3330
04:05:03,647 --> 04:05:07,573
SAM: I guess I should do a Cutting Words, just to
help a little bit.

3331
04:05:07,573 --> 04:05:09,329
MATT: What's the range on Cutting Words,
unfortunately?

3332
04:05:09,329 --> 04:05:14,597
SAM: Probably 60, 30? Is he further than that?
Damn it.

3333
04:05:14,597 --> 04:05:23,211
MATT: Unfortunately. The distance of the bard.
Just to make sure. 60 feet, yeah. So that's 66

3334
04:05:23,211 --> 04:05:32,580
points of acid damage to Grog, Shale, halved to
you, and 66 to Percy.

3335
04:05:32,580 --> 04:05:34,736
LAURA: Trinket's unconscious.

3336
04:05:34,736 --> 04:05:36,722
MATT: Trinket is unconscious and dissolving.

3337
04:05:36,722 --> 04:05:38,085
TALIESIN: I'm unconscious.

3338
04:05:38,085 --> 04:05:40,230
MATT: Percy is unconscious and dissolving. Grog?

3339
04:05:40,230 --> 04:05:41,376
TRAVIS: I'm good.

3340
04:05:41,376 --> 04:05:42,519
MATT: You're good. Hit points.

3341
04:05:42,519 --> 04:05:46,130
TRAVIS: I have a question. Because he attacked me,
do I get my retaliation attack on him?

3342
04:05:46,130 --> 04:05:47,866
MATT: Yes, you do.

3343
04:05:47,866 --> 04:05:51,483
MARISHA: Kill him, motherfucker! Kill him!

3344
04:05:51,483 --> 04:05:53,440
MATT: Shale, what are you at?

3345
04:05:53,440 --> 04:05:58,227
CHRIS: This will depend on this roll. I've got
Stone's Endurance, so I'm going to try to use my

3346
04:05:58,227 --> 04:06:01,645
reaction to reduce the damage, and I reduce it by
enough to keep me up.

3347
04:06:01,645 --> 04:06:06,752
MATT: Fantastic! She's got grit! She's got
perseverance!

3348
04:06:06,752 --> 04:06:08,306
SAM: So sexy!

3349
04:06:08,306 --> 04:06:10,220
CHRIS: I'm at two hit points.

3350
04:06:10,220 --> 04:06:13,121
MATT: All right, Grog, go for it. Not with
advantage.

3351
04:06:13,121 --> 04:06:14,583
TRAVIS: It's not reckless?

3352
04:06:14,583 --> 04:06:16,258
MATT: The reckless is for your actual attack
round.

3353
04:06:16,258 --> 04:06:18,384
TRAVIS: The first one was an 18.

3354
04:06:18,384 --> 04:06:23,287
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is. Let me double check.
Just so the internet doesn't yell at me. It's

3355
04:06:23,287 --> 04:06:25,641
going to yell at me anyway, it always yells at
me.

3356
04:06:25,641 --> 04:06:30,756
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

3357
04:06:30,756 --> 04:06:33,413
TRAVIS: It's a 27, so.

3358
04:06:33,413 --> 04:06:35,285
MARISHA: This fucker's got to be close to death,
right?

3359
04:06:35,285 --> 04:06:36,756
TALIESIN: Nope.

3360
04:06:36,756 --> 04:06:38,988
MATT: During this turn, not round, so yeah.

3361
04:06:38,988 --> 04:06:40,724
TRAVIS: That was a 27 for the first one.

3362
04:06:40,724 --> 04:06:42,702
MATT: 27 was the hit? That hits. Roll damage.

3363
04:06:42,702 --> 04:06:49,166
TRAVIS: 18.

3364
04:06:49,166 --> 04:06:50,598
LAURA: Plus necrotic.

3365
04:06:50,598 --> 04:06:54,009
TRAVIS: Thank you. 22.

3366
04:06:54,009 --> 04:06:57,051
MATT: 22.

3367
04:06:57,051 --> 04:06:58,806
How do you want to do this?

3368
04:06:58,806 --> 04:07:04,284
(cheering)

3369
04:07:04,284 --> 04:07:06,478
TRAVIS: Did the fucking necrotic do it?

3370
04:07:06,478 --> 04:07:09,374
(screaming)

3371
04:07:09,374 --> 04:07:11,664
SAM: Oh, god.

3372
04:07:11,664 --> 04:07:19,863
MATT: So. Held aloft by Bigby's Hand, acid sprayed
in your face, two of your friends on the ground,

3373
04:07:19,863 --> 04:07:25,369
unconscious and dissolving, in the center of the
dragon's lair, Grog Strongjaw, how do you want to

3374
04:07:25,369 --> 04:07:26,570
do this?

3375
04:07:26,570 --> 04:07:31,119
TRAVIS: I rear back with the bloodaxe and I swing
for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw

3376
04:07:31,119 --> 04:07:34,760
meet, and I'd like to cleave up under his skull
into his brain.

3377
04:07:34,760 --> 04:07:44,024
MATT: As you lunge forward, the darkness fills
you, but the feral instinct that you've grown up

3378
04:07:44,024 --> 04:07:48,156
with is enough to know the source of that pain,
the source of that acid, is also the source of

3379
04:07:48,156 --> 04:07:54,875
victory. And as you swing wide, the jaw, still
extended from the blast of acid, you push through

3380
04:07:54,875 --> 04:08:00,682
it, as it's spraying into you, and the sheer force
of your blade hits the edge of the jaw, and you

3381
04:08:00,682 --> 04:08:06,944
push, and you hear from the back of the throat, as
the acid is projected, the gurgle of horrible,

3382
04:08:06,944 --> 04:08:14,953
shrieking pain. (groan) The stream stops as the
blade goes towards the base of the skull, pushing

3383
04:08:14,953 --> 04:08:24,268
forward and upward. You divide the actual mouth of
Umbrasyl like that. The darkness (whoosh) flicks

3384
04:08:24,268 --> 04:08:30,284
out, as you guys watch Grog descending, putting
your foot now onto the front of the dragon's neck,

3385
04:08:30,284 --> 04:08:36,681
you stand up, getting hold onto where the wound is
there, still living, the one working eye flitting

3386
04:08:36,681 --> 04:08:41,103
about wildly, you reach up and grab the edge of
the nose, bring the axe up with the other hand,

3387
04:08:41,103 --> 04:08:47,777
and slam again, and again, and as you do, the eye
rolls back. The whole body begins to fall limp as

3388
04:08:47,777 --> 04:08:51,876
it crumples backward. Vax, I need you to go ahead
and make a dexterity saving throw.

3389
04:08:51,876 --> 04:08:57,979
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I am very unconscious.

3390
04:08:57,979 --> 04:08:59,826
ASHLEY: You'll be okay. I've got you.

3391
04:08:59,826 --> 04:09:01,957
LIAM: 25.

3392
04:09:01,957 --> 04:09:09,695
MATT: 25. Okay, you dodge out of the way as the
dragon plummets to the ground. (heavy impact) What

3393
04:09:09,695 --> 04:09:11,685
was Trinket's maximum hit points?

3394
04:09:11,685 --> 04:09:13,175
LAURA: It was 60.

3395
04:09:13,175 --> 04:09:15,887
MATT: Let me check something here.

3396
04:09:15,887 --> 04:09:26,323
LAURA: But he was at 53 when he got hit.

3397
04:09:26,323 --> 04:09:31,164
MATT: The remaining damage. Yeah, you're fine.

3398
04:09:31,164 --> 04:09:36,369
TRAVIS: Night saved.

3399
04:09:36,369 --> 04:09:43,015
MATT: Umbrasyl's body hits the ground, the two
arms reach up, and the body still continues to

3400
04:09:43,015 --> 04:09:48,784
pull itself backwards. You pull out of the way.
The head lolls around, the jaw now grossly,

3401
04:09:48,784 --> 04:09:56,431
cartoonishly open, giving out these horrible
choking sounds, as the blood and bile and acid all

3402
04:09:56,431 --> 04:10:03,637
mingle. It tries to talk. The bubbles continue
coming forward before it stumbles, the arms

3403
04:10:03,637 --> 04:10:10,950
sprawled out, its head falls limp to the side as
the eye twitches and then falls still.

3404
04:10:10,950 --> 04:10:13,429
ASHLEY: I run over to Percy.

3405
04:10:13,429 --> 04:10:15,024
LAURA: I run over to Trinket.

3406
04:10:15,024 --> 04:10:18,792
MARISHA: I drop my water elemental form.

3407
04:10:18,792 --> 04:10:24,250
ASHLEY: I touch Percy and I cast Heal on him.

3408
04:10:24,250 --> 04:10:25,850
MARISHA: Nice.

3409
04:10:25,850 --> 04:10:29,939
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket.

3410
04:10:29,939 --> 04:10:41,596
MATT: As you stand there, Shale, watching the
dragon fall as Grog Strongjaw, the once runt of

3411
04:10:41,596 --> 04:10:48,564
the Herd of Storms, slams the blade over and over
again in the dragon's head, a little part of you

3412
04:10:48,564 --> 04:10:54,705
is a little jealous, and another part proud, and a
little sad that this was not the time for you to

3413
04:10:54,705 --> 04:10:57,486
lose your life in battle against a mighty dragon.

3414
04:10:57,486 --> 04:10:58,828
ASHLEY: Oh, Shale.

3415
04:10:58,828 --> 04:11:00,481
LIAM: Can you believe it?

3416
04:11:00,481 --> 04:11:02,370
SAM: Shale jumps into acid.

3417
04:11:02,370 --> 04:11:05,377
LIAM: Just walks in.

3418
04:11:05,377 --> 04:11:07,829
CHRIS: Dissolves.

3419
04:11:07,829 --> 04:11:21,331
MATT: (sizzle) I can make that joke in two weeks!
As you go and bring Trinket around for a second,

3420
04:11:21,331 --> 04:11:26,528
using the last bit of the magic that's been
afforded to you as a ranger, Trinket comes to.

3421
04:11:26,528 --> 04:11:35,149
(bear grunt) A lot of the fur has been singed off,
and spotted flesh with acid burn, but is conscious

3422
04:11:35,149 --> 04:11:42,198
and alive, and weak, Trinket leans forward as
you're cradling his head and licks the side of

3423
04:11:42,198 --> 04:11:45,730
your face and tucks his nose into the side of your
shoulder.

3424
04:11:45,730 --> 04:11:47,662
LAURA: You were so brave in here!

3425
04:11:47,662 --> 04:11:54,630
MATT: (bear grunt) You go ahead and help Percy get
off the ground. You come to consciousness again

3426
04:11:54,630 --> 04:11:59,440
and you see Pike's hand touching yours as she
lifts you. Suddenly, a surge of invigoration hits

3427
04:11:59,440 --> 04:12:02,297
your body, and you find yourself feeling a lot
better than you did a few moments ago.

3428
04:12:02,297 --> 04:12:03,730
TALIESIN: Yeah, what am I at?

3429
04:12:03,730 --> 04:12:05,479
ASHLEY: 70 hit points.

3430
04:12:05,479 --> 04:12:07,321
LAURA: That's major.

3431
04:12:07,321 --> 04:12:10,256
MATT: Heal, man. Clerics don't fuck around.

3432
04:12:10,256 --> 04:12:12,224
ASHLEY: I saved it just in case.

3433
04:12:12,224 --> 04:12:16,107
LAURA and MARISHA: Holy shit, Grog!

3434
04:12:16,107 --> 04:12:22,505
ASHLEY: Grog! I run over to Grog and I jump up on
his leg, I'm going to sit on his foot.

3435
04:12:22,505 --> 04:12:23,494
TRAVIS: Monstah!

3436
04:12:23,494 --> 04:12:24,881
ASHLEY: Yeah, monstah!

3437
04:12:24,881 --> 04:12:32,751
CHRIS: I will remove my dragon tooth necklace and
pass it off to Grog.

3438
04:12:32,751 --> 04:12:34,970
TRAVIS: No, Shale.

3439
04:12:34,970 --> 04:12:40,358
CHRIS: You must take this. You've got many more
battles left in you. This is going to serve you

3440
04:12:40,358 --> 04:12:45,792
better than it ever served me. And just so you
know, I don't know what the Herd would do, but if

3441
04:12:45,792 --> 04:12:50,380
you ever go into battle again against other
dragons, you know who to call. I'll be ready.

3442
04:12:50,380 --> 04:13:00,265
TRAVIS: Yeah. The wielder of the magic stick of
nose-whappiness. I will wear this with honor.

3443
04:13:00,265 --> 04:13:04,849
CHRIS: All right. So whenever you, by the way,
whenever you spend hit dice to regain hit points,

3444
04:13:04,849 --> 04:13:06,686
you double the number of hit points restored.

3445
04:13:06,686 --> 04:13:08,170
TRAVIS: With the necklace?

3446
04:13:08,170 --> 04:13:09,131
CHRIS: Yes.

3447
04:13:09,131 --> 04:13:10,587
TRAVIS: Oh, snap!

3448
04:13:10,587 --> 04:13:11,954
ASHLEY: You what?

3449
04:13:11,954 --> 04:13:13,855
CHRIS: Double your hit points you restore.

3450
04:13:13,855 --> 04:13:20,262
TRAVIS: I thought it was bullshit, but it's not!
Dope!

3451
04:13:20,262 --> 04:13:23,253
LIAM: You finally have some hit points.

3452
04:13:23,253 --> 04:13:29,829
LAURA: You know, if you seek another dragon to
kill, you might meet us in Whitestone. We're

3453
04:13:29,829 --> 04:13:31,895
forming an army there.

3454
04:13:31,895 --> 04:13:33,694
CHRIS: I just might.

3455
04:13:33,694 --> 04:13:40,418
MARISHA: Keyleth drops elemental form and goes
over to Vax and grabs him by the face.

3456
04:13:40,418 --> 04:13:43,220
LIAM: You'd have to lean over for that.

3457
04:13:43,220 --> 04:13:44,725
SAM: He's a little boy!

3458
04:13:44,725 --> 04:13:46,226
LAURA: It's like kissing a child.

3459
04:13:46,226 --> 04:13:51,464
CHRIS: He's like a little voodoo doll of Vax.

3460
04:13:51,464 --> 04:13:56,216
LIAM: I'm not pygmied or anything, I'm like a
doll.

3461
04:13:56,216 --> 04:14:01,473
LAURA: Keep it going, Keyleth. Just mug down with
him.

3462
04:14:01,473 --> 04:14:03,736
LIAM: Maybe this should wait till later?

3463
04:14:03,736 --> 04:14:10,211
MARISHA: I tap him on the face, and say: So glad
you're not dead. And I walk away.

3464
04:14:10,211 --> 04:14:16,565
LIAM: I'm going to shake that off, and then I'm
going to do a once around the entire chamber and

3465
04:14:16,565 --> 04:14:23,057
look around for any traps I can find, especially
around that pile up top, but also, I don't know

3466
04:14:23,057 --> 04:14:29,704
that they'll be here, but see if there's anything
like what we saw in Krieg's cave with the crystals

3467
04:14:29,704 --> 04:14:31,919
in the wall. Little peeky stones.

3468
04:14:31,919 --> 04:14:34,529
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3469
04:14:34,529 --> 04:14:37,172
LAURA: Can I look for those, too, since dragons?

3470
04:14:37,172 --> 04:14:39,846
LIAM: 22.

3471
04:14:39,846 --> 04:14:45,321
LAURA: Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get
advantage on all dragon things.

3472
04:14:45,321 --> 04:14:47,424
MATT: You do.

3473
04:14:47,424 --> 04:14:56,849
LAURA: It doesn't matter. I rolled shit, twice.
12.

3474
04:14:56,849 --> 04:15:02,129
MATT: 12, okay. You guys spend the better part of
the next 15 or so minutes glancing around and

3475
04:15:02,129 --> 04:15:11,485
trying to find any sign of these strange obsidian
spheres that were previously in the lair of Krieg,

3476
04:15:11,485 --> 04:15:20,062
or Brimscythe. After coasting through the crates
and barrels, gold piles, the various artifacts and

3477
04:15:20,062 --> 04:15:25,692
trinkets and things that are strewn about this
back corner, no sign of anything like that.

3478
04:15:25,692 --> 04:15:29,850
LIAM: What about weaponry in that pile of shit?

3479
04:15:29,850 --> 04:15:32,394
LAURA: What about all the stuff in that pile of
shit?

3480
04:15:32,394 --> 04:15:34,232
TRAVIS: You want to rage loot?

3481
04:15:34,232 --> 04:15:36,029
MATT: There's a lot of things in there.

3482
04:15:36,029 --> 04:15:38,611
LIAM: I was first on the pile. Are there any
weapons in there?

3483
04:15:38,611 --> 04:15:49,337
MATT: There are weapons. There are two glaives,
polearm glaives. There appear to be a number of

3484
04:15:49,337 --> 04:15:55,457
pieces of ornamental armor, very beautiful, made
of gold and platinum, that were either used for

3485
04:15:55,457 --> 04:16:00,341
ceremonial reasons or just adorning some sort of
popular hall.

3486
04:16:00,341 --> 04:16:02,923
MARISHA: Keyleth walks over and pulls out her Hunk
of Quall.

3487
04:16:02,923 --> 04:16:06,520
SAM: Yeah, Quall it up.

3488
04:16:06,520 --> 04:16:15,501
MARISHA: I'm going to Quall it up all over top of
the gold, see if anything lights up with my Wi-Fi

3489
04:16:15,501 --> 04:16:19,146
detector. Since that's what I feel like it is.

3490
04:16:19,146 --> 04:16:26,166
MATT: Strangely enough, no. Nothing seems to glow
in the vicinity of the Hunk of Quall.

3491
04:16:26,166 --> 04:16:28,067
LIAM: And no other blades?

3492
04:16:28,067 --> 04:16:34,926
MATT: There are two glaives. Pulling the list up
here. Going through the whole hoard, because it is

3493
04:16:34,926 --> 04:16:39,406
11:20, we may pick up the actual looting element
at the beginning of next session. We'll be here

3494
04:16:39,406 --> 04:16:41,266
for a while if you want to do that.

3495
04:16:41,266 --> 04:16:43,324
LAURA: I like the sound of that.

3496
04:16:43,324 --> 04:16:47,127
MARISHA: We have to go back and get Fassbender.

3497
04:16:47,127 --> 04:16:53,068
LAURA: Yeah, we're totally going to go back. We're
going to return a lot of this gold to Whiterun.

3498
04:16:53,068 --> 04:16:54,937
Westruun. All the towns.

3499
04:16:54,937 --> 04:17:01,699
SAM: Well, all the gold that we can definitely
prove came from Westruun, we'll bring back.

3500
04:17:01,699 --> 04:17:02,810
LAURA: I agree.

3501
04:17:02,810 --> 04:17:04,316
SAM: With Westruun markings.

3502
04:17:04,316 --> 04:17:07,173
LAURA: All the other gold that's just sitting
around, I mean, we should probably just take to

3503
04:17:07,173 --> 04:17:08,426
help the battles.

3504
04:17:08,426 --> 04:17:11,973
TRAVIS: Plus it would be nice to give Shale some
gold to take back to the Herd.

3505
04:17:11,973 --> 04:17:13,025
SAM: Who?

3506
04:17:13,025 --> 04:17:14,267
TRAVIS: Shale.

3507
04:17:14,267 --> 04:17:16,740
SAM: The Herd? I thought the Herd's-- Okay.

3508
04:17:16,740 --> 04:17:21,668
TRAVIS: There was a great remnant. The Herd will
live again, and with Shale's wisdom.

3509
04:17:21,668 --> 04:17:29,373
MARISHA: There were still a few members of the
Herd still alive. A good half dozen.

3510
04:17:29,373 --> 04:17:32,395
TRAVIS: Zanror's baby mama is still preggo.

3511
04:17:32,395 --> 04:17:33,735
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.

3512
04:17:33,735 --> 04:17:39,524
LIAM: It's also very lean times in Westruun. Most
of this gold should go back to Westruun.

3513
04:17:39,524 --> 04:17:42,418
LAURA: Most of it.

3514
04:17:42,418 --> 04:17:45,703
MARISHA: Did we contribute any of our own gold
into this pile?

3515
04:17:45,703 --> 04:17:49,917
LIAM: That's back in Westruun.

3516
04:17:49,917 --> 04:17:54,558
CHRIS: I can return with the remnants of the Herd
and gather up whatever you don't take.

3517
04:17:54,558 --> 04:17:56,837
LAURA: And bring it back to Westruun.

3518
04:17:56,837 --> 04:17:58,032
SAM: We'll divvy it up later.

3519
04:17:58,032 --> 04:18:00,239
MARISHA: Let's divvy it up.

3520
04:18:00,239 --> 04:18:04,070
LIAM: If we take most of the gold that came from
Westruun, we're a big pack of assholes.

3521
04:18:04,070 --> 04:18:07,846
LAURA: I said we weren't going to! We're going to
take it back to Westruun.

3522
04:18:07,846 --> 04:18:11,073
SAM: You're a tiny pack of assholes right now.

3523
04:18:11,073 --> 04:18:13,265
MARISHA: Is he still tiny? He's still tiny.

3524
04:18:13,265 --> 04:18:14,370
LAURA: Three hours.

3525
04:18:14,370 --> 04:18:15,836
LIAM: Probably another two hours.

3526
04:18:15,836 --> 04:18:17,177
LAURA: It's only been an hour? No.

3527
04:18:17,177 --> 04:18:19,682
MATT: You have, probably another 20, 30 minutes or
so before it fades.

3528
04:18:19,682 --> 04:18:24,423
MARISHA: We need Fassbender.

3529
04:18:24,423 --> 04:18:30,668
TRAVIS: Keyleth, you're going to butcher this
dragon, right?

3530
04:18:30,668 --> 04:18:36,471
MARISHA: Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town
on it.

3531
04:18:36,471 --> 04:18:40,314
LAURA: Because this is going to be worth a lot of
fucking money.

3532
04:18:40,314 --> 04:18:42,564
MARISHA: Yeah. Percy, do you have any extra vials?
Empty vials for blood?

3533
04:18:42,564 --> 04:18:45,958
LAURA: We should get some of the blood and put it
in the Bag of Colding.

3534
04:18:45,958 --> 04:18:51,143
MARISHA: Hey, Percy! So glad you're alive and not
burning in acid. Do you have any extra vials?

3535
04:18:51,143 --> 04:18:54,719
TALIESIN: Do I?

3536
04:18:54,719 --> 04:19:03,396
MATT: Checking in your various pieces of equipment
you have on you, as opposed to what you have

3537
04:19:03,396 --> 04:19:10,595
stored elsewhere, you had a few vials. They are a
little jangly when you reach for them, and you

3538
04:19:10,595 --> 04:19:13,628
realize they've been crushed.

3539
04:19:13,628 --> 04:19:15,535
TALIESIN: We have some empty potion bottles.

3540
04:19:15,535 --> 04:19:17,530
LIAM: I hand mine over from the one I gave Vex.

3541
04:19:17,530 --> 04:19:19,189
TALIESIN: The one I used as well.

3542
04:19:19,189 --> 04:19:21,473
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check.

3543
04:19:21,473 --> 04:19:29,785
MARISHA: I'll take that 16 for a 27. Nature check,
yeah? 27.

3544
04:19:29,785 --> 04:19:36,443
MATT: All right. So as you guys are gathering the
elements of this dragon's hoard, gathering the

3545
04:19:36,443 --> 04:19:42,434
equipment, the art pieces, the relics, all things
that were part of this-- and it is, especially

3546
04:19:42,434 --> 04:19:50,127
since you know, as far as dragon hoards go,
especially for an ancient dragon, it isn't huge.

3547
04:19:50,127 --> 04:19:57,730
And with the recent moving in, you get the idea
that this dragon's true hoard probably exists

3548
04:19:57,730 --> 04:20:05,032
elsewhere. This was either a temporary lair, or
was intended to be the new lair, and the process

3549
04:20:05,032 --> 04:20:13,930
of transitioning hadn't quite begun. Most of the
gold here seems to have been what was given to

3550
04:20:13,930 --> 04:20:17,405
Umbrasyl by the Herd once they had taken over
Westruun.

3551
04:20:17,405 --> 04:20:20,742
LIAM: Maybe he has to give it to Thordak in a
dragon pyramid scheme.

3552
04:20:20,742 --> 04:20:25,601
LAURA: We don't find any of those glyphs like
there were in--

3553
04:20:25,601 --> 04:20:28,537
TALIESIN: We already looked for those.

3554
04:20:28,537 --> 04:20:34,981
LAURA: Not the circles, I meant the transportation
glyph that we beamed into his--

3555
04:20:34,981 --> 04:20:42,228
MATT: That you saw in Krieg's lair? No. You do
know, from having one made by Allura within your

3556
04:20:42,228 --> 04:20:48,192
keep before, that they take quite some time to
ingrain. Dragon's only really had over a week or

3557
04:20:48,192 --> 04:21:00,805
so. So, gathering up the materials, the remnants
of that hoard, you guys descend down the mountain

3558
04:21:00,805 --> 04:21:03,777
if you wish, or is there anything else you wish to
accomplish within the actual lair?

3559
04:21:03,777 --> 04:21:06,446
MARISHA: I want to harvest some scales, some
blood, and some teeth.

3560
04:21:06,446 --> 04:21:13,280
MATT: Right, based on the roll you made. So we
have two empty vials that you managed to acquire.

3561
04:21:13,280 --> 04:21:15,431
MARISHA: Plus he had three in his Bag of Holding.

3562
04:21:15,431 --> 04:21:17,037
LIAM: Can I help her out?

3563
04:21:17,037 --> 04:21:22,807
MATT: Yeah. It's difficult because, with the
nature of Umbrasyl's death, as well as being a

3564
04:21:22,807 --> 04:21:29,582
creature that is naturally caustic and acidic in a
large portion of its body, there was a mixing of a

3565
04:21:29,582 --> 04:21:35,741
lot of the blood that has caused it to become
impure while vialing it, so you get three vials of

3566
04:21:35,741 --> 04:21:39,703
the blood that are still pure and viable.
Everything else seems to dissolve through the

3567
04:21:39,703 --> 04:21:41,085
glass upon contact.

3568
04:21:41,085 --> 04:21:43,241
LAURA: I can put it in the Bag of Colding, and
then it'll keep it.

3569
04:21:43,241 --> 04:21:48,007
TALIESIN: I can assist with any of the cutting,
because I've got the fuck-all sword.

3570
04:21:48,007 --> 04:21:52,113
MARISHA: I hand the three vials of blood to Vex to
put in the Bag of Colding.

3571
04:21:52,113 --> 04:21:58,276
MATT: Many dragon's teeth were sundered in the
ravaging of Umbrasyl at Grog's furious storm of

3572
04:21:58,276 --> 04:22:05,549
axe blade strikes. However, you do manage to
harvest from the body, unscathed, 14 ancient black

3573
04:22:05,549 --> 04:22:06,925
dragon teeth.

3574
04:22:06,925 --> 04:22:11,677
MARISHA: We should make some sweet necklaces. Any
scales?

3575
04:22:11,677 --> 04:22:20,906
MATT: Quite a lot of scales here, yes. It's going
to take you a long time to harvest what you can

3576
04:22:20,906 --> 04:22:25,644
off this body. A lot of the areas have been
damaged from the various wounds and such. How much

3577
04:22:25,644 --> 04:22:27,679
time do you want to spend to harvest scales?

3578
04:22:27,679 --> 04:22:29,241
LIAM: Do you think we should just camp here for
the night?

3579
04:22:29,241 --> 04:22:30,669
TALIESIN: We could just camp here for the night.

3580
04:22:30,669 --> 04:22:35,049
LAURA: As long as the other dragons don't realize
that we've just done this. Would I know if they

3581
04:22:35,049 --> 04:22:36,293
would know?

3582
04:22:36,293 --> 04:22:37,912
MATT: You have no idea.

3583
04:22:37,912 --> 04:22:41,638
LAURA: I don't know if it's actually safe to just
hang out in this dragon's lair.

3584
04:22:41,638 --> 04:22:46,181
TALIESIN: You know what we can do, is we can make
the magic mansion in that cave off to the side, in

3585
04:22:46,181 --> 04:22:48,279
the very back of it.

3586
04:22:48,279 --> 04:22:49,682
LAURA: That's a wonderful idea.

3587
04:22:49,682 --> 04:22:51,718
ASHLEY: And that magic trap, we didn't set it
off.

3588
04:22:51,718 --> 04:22:54,204
TALIESIN: We haven't sprung the magic trap,
either, so that's just none the wiser.

3589
04:22:54,204 --> 04:22:56,615
SAM: Okay.

3590
04:22:56,615 --> 04:23:02,019
MARISHA: All right. I'll spend as much time then,
I'll stay up as long as I can throughout the

3591
04:23:02,019 --> 04:23:05,738
night. If I hear any disturbances I'll come back
to the mansion.

3592
04:23:05,738 --> 04:23:07,468
TALIESIN: I'll help.

3593
04:23:07,468 --> 04:23:12,908
CHRIS: Once we get to the mansion, Shale will bid
the group farewell and head down to Westruun to

3594
04:23:12,908 --> 04:23:19,157
let the rest of the Herd know what's happened,
about the great triumph of the bearded king.

3595
04:23:19,157 --> 04:23:22,274
LAURA: Yeah!

3596
04:23:22,274 --> 04:23:25,232
MATT: As you come down and--

3597
04:23:25,232 --> 04:23:27,246
CHRIS: I'm killed by an owlbear.

3598
04:23:27,246 --> 04:23:33,252
MATT: Ravaged and eaten horribly in the
Bramblewood, never to be seen again!

3599
04:23:33,252 --> 04:23:35,956
CHRIS: Nobody hears the tale of the bearded king!

3600
04:23:35,956 --> 04:23:37,621
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch!

3601
04:23:37,621 --> 04:23:43,278
TALIESIN: Forever, the Herd will just say, Grog,
that asshole.

3602
04:23:43,278 --> 04:23:44,887
MARISHA: Such a dick.

3603
04:23:44,887 --> 04:23:51,665
MATT: No, you come down and as you speak with the
remnants of the Herd of Storms, many of which, a

3604
04:23:51,665 --> 04:23:57,949
number of them did survive the battle, though
scarred horribly, and many did lose their life in

3605
04:23:57,949 --> 04:24:04,986
the battle with Umbrasyl. Zanror, Worra,
recovering all right. However, the number's now

3606
04:24:04,986 --> 04:24:10,894
thinned down to a simple 12 members of the Herd.
As you speak with Zanror, he looks to you and

3607
04:24:10,894 --> 04:24:14,251
says, "Shale. You live."

3608
04:24:14,251 --> 04:24:17,424
CHRIS: Obviously.

3609
04:24:17,424 --> 04:24:22,346
MATT: "Have you word of the mountain? The
dragon?"

3610
04:24:22,346 --> 04:24:33,044
CHRIS: I toss one of its teeth at him. He will
trouble us no more. He is a bygone.

3611
04:24:33,044 --> 04:24:40,580
MATT: "Good. Good." He takes the tooth and gives
it to Worra. "Well."

3612
04:24:40,580 --> 04:24:43,094
CHRIS: It's the work of those adventurers.

3613
04:24:43,094 --> 04:24:46,773
MATT: "Vox Machina, they call themselves."

3614
04:24:46,773 --> 04:24:49,513
CHRIS: They are truly great.

3615
04:24:49,513 --> 04:24:53,689
MATT: "Good. We need greatness in this world.
We--"

3616
04:24:53,689 --> 04:24:57,388
CHRIS: Don't be so glum, you old fool.

3617
04:24:57,388 --> 04:25:00,004
MATT: He grins to himself.

3618
04:25:00,004 --> 04:25:02,771
CHRIS: This is a day of glory. A great battle has
been won.

3619
04:25:02,771 --> 04:25:06,425
MATT: "It is. But there's been a lot of cost in
it, too."

3620
04:25:06,425 --> 04:25:13,348
CHRIS: There's always cost. We will all die, it
just depends on how. We died fighting a dragon,

3621
04:25:13,348 --> 04:25:21,521
and we lived fighting a dragon. What more do you
want? That's the smile I want to see.

3622
04:25:21,521 --> 04:25:26,890
MATT: "I'm glad you're back, Shale. Your wisdom
stays strong."

3623
04:25:26,890 --> 04:25:31,883
CHRIS: Well, now that Kevdak's out of the way,
maybe people will listen to what I have to say for

3624
04:25:31,883 --> 04:25:33,260
a change.

3625
04:25:33,260 --> 04:25:42,460
MATT: "We've been talking here. I think the Herd
of Storms died in battle with the dragon. There's

3626
04:25:42,460 --> 04:25:43,873
"not many of us left."

3627
04:25:43,873 --> 04:25:45,627
CHRIS: But there are other herds.

3628
04:25:45,627 --> 04:25:50,465
MATT: "There are. And while we lost the Rivermaw,
I think maybe it's time we went and joined them."

3629
04:25:50,465 --> 04:25:53,826
CHRIS: I like that idea.

3630
04:25:53,826 --> 04:26:00,110
MATT: "They're damper lands. Better for raising
children. Take a break from all this warring and

3631
04:26:00,110 --> 04:26:05,061
"go back to a simple life. Will you come with us,
Shale?"

3632
04:26:05,061 --> 04:26:06,516
CHRIS: Of course.

3633
04:26:06,516 --> 04:26:12,024
MATT: "Good. We'll set out tomorrow. At dawn, we
plan."

3634
04:26:12,024 --> 04:26:15,961
SAM: He's learned!

3635
04:26:15,961 --> 04:26:25,206
MATT: You guys set up for the evening, resting
your sore, bruised bodies, smelling the ruin of

3636
04:26:25,206 --> 04:26:29,880
the black dragon as you prepare for an evening's
rest, well-earned. We will close this evening's

3637
04:26:29,880 --> 04:26:32,630
session. Well fought, guys!

3638
04:26:32,630 --> 04:26:34,062
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3639
04:26:34,062 --> 04:26:35,582
MARISHA: We didn't die!

3640
04:26:35,582 --> 04:26:39,713
LIAM: Scanlan, is there a hot springs in this
mansion?

3641
04:26:39,713 --> 04:26:42,325
SAM: There can be whatever you want.

3642
04:26:42,325 --> 04:26:48,492
LIAM: We need to bathe, soak. We need a good soak
to get the stink off.

3643
04:26:48,492 --> 04:26:52,745
MATT: It's amazing. You imagine why he didn't
mention it before, but Scanlan does indeed have a

3644
04:26:52,745 --> 04:26:54,803
hot spring in his magnificent mansion.

3645
04:26:54,803 --> 04:26:56,064
TRAVIS: It's amazing!

3646
04:26:56,064 --> 04:27:03,913
MATT: No, it's magnificent. Guys, a big thank you
and round of applause for Chris Perkins!

3647
04:27:03,913 --> 04:27:09,473
CHRIS: Thanks for having me! It's a great honor to
be here. Thank you.

3648
04:27:09,473 --> 04:27:15,198
MATT: All right, well. We'll pick this back up
again next week on Thursday to see what the next

3649
04:27:15,198 --> 04:27:23,864
adventure holds for Vox Machina now that one of
the four Conclave remaining have fallen! I can

3650
04:27:23,864 --> 04:27:30,674
tell you with the death of one dragon, I doubt the
others, upon hearing of it, will be anywhere near

3651
04:27:30,674 --> 04:27:37,334
as careless as Umbrasyl was. But there are more
Vestiges to find, more allies to acquire. Who

3652
04:27:37,334 --> 04:27:41,169
knows what other dangers lie in the realms of
Tal'Dorei and beyond, outside of the Conclave's

3653
04:27:41,169 --> 04:27:44,817
threat? We shall see in the weeks to come. Guys,
thank you so much for staying up with us tonight.

3654
04:27:44,817 --> 04:27:51,976
Rest well, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys
next week.

3655
04:27:51,976 --> 04:30:05,901
