00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:05,220
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
pseudo, not-really episode of Critical Role, where

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,417
a bunch of nerdy voice actors sit around here and
tonight, maybe play a little bit of Dungeons &

3
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:13,989
Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer and
unfortunately, we have a number of members who

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:18,809
were sick after our convention appearances this
last weekend, who couldn't make the game tonight

5
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,050
due to unfortunate circumstances. So with the
amount of people who couldn't make it, we decided

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,353
to instead not play this week and instead, do a
live Q&A with the questions in the chat room and

7
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:34,331
as well as questions that were put on Reddit, so
we'll get to those there in just a moment. And

8
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:43,097
then, when that's over, as decided recently, I'm
going to have a fun battle royale. I made a small

9
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:49,060
arena and the latter half of today's episode is
going to be Grog versus Keyleth versus Zahra

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,052
versus Kashaw free-for-all. See who stands winning
at the end of this show.

11
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:58,243
WILL: It's going to be such a slaughter.

12
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,924
MARY: I'm looking forward to the three minutes of
gameplay.

13
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,542
WILL: Exactly! It's going to be 90 seconds of
great fighting.

14
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,738
MATT: I cannot wait!

15
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:07,967
TRAVIS: Can anyone cast Hold Person or Friends?

16
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:14,646
WILL: I can. That's good to know! Okay, see, I wouldn't
have known that. Just like turning undead the first

17
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:16,247
time.

18
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,859
TRAVIS: I shouldn't have said anything.

19
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,817
MARY: Why did you say anything?

20
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:23,668
MATT: So that will be the second half of the show
after we take our midway break. Before that

21
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:26,949
happens, let's do a quick round of announcements.
First and foremost, I wanted to say thank you to

22
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:34,330
our Critters and fans that came out to Wizard
World Portland this past weekend. We had an

23
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,992
incredible turnout. Wizard World was very happy
and we're looking to possibly be doing more of

24
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:41,098
those in the near future. So we'll be able to see
other parts of the US, meet more of you guys we

25
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:45,325
didn't have the chance to that weekend. It's
wonderful to meet all of you, both at the con and

26
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:48,492
at Guardian Games out there. It was a great game
store. We got to hang out with a bunch of you in

27
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:55,510
person. But thank you so much for coming out and
visiting. We really appreciate it. Also today, I

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,853
put up on the Dungeons Masters Guild site,
dmsguild.com, a new order for the blood hunter

29
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:09,725
class. It's called Order of the Lycan. Which I
mentioned a little bit at Wizard World, but it's

30
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:16,316
essentially a blood hunter order that involves, as
part of a ritual called the Taming, they accept

31
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:23,289
the lycanthropic curse and through training and
honing their willpower and the blood magic that is

32
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,757
part of blood hunters' training, they can control
the curse of lycanthropy to a certain extent to

33
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:32,851
prevent themselves from going berserk, but still reap
the benefits as they transform into whatever

34
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,178
were-creature they choose--

35
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:36,821
TRAVIS: Were-creature?

36
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,611
MATT: I mean, there's were-tigers, were-rat. So
you decide which strain you're infected with.

37
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:43,246
WILL: A were-rat would be pretty damn cool.

38
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,584
TRAVIS: Can you change, or are you locked into
one?

39
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:48,617
MATT: No, you're locked to the strain of
lycanthropy you are, unless you get uncursed and

40
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,213
you get another strain.

41
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,364
MARISHA: Like half rat, half person.

42
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,580
TRAVIS: Like a big ass rat or you're like little
bitty?

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,181
MATT: No, you're like, big ass nasty--

44
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,259
TRAVIS: Princess Bride.

45
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,896
MATT: --Warhammer Skaven style. It's pretty rad.
Yeah, bigger than that.

46
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,605
WILL: I don't think they exist.

47
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:07,101
MATT: But yeah, it's on the DMs Guild site. It's
free. Go check it out, see if it's something you

48
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:15,586
guys want. Check it out. It's good. Also, another
announcement I want to make real fast, I'm saying

49
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:20,710
this because I've gotten 15 to 20 tweets a day
about it, for the Earthbreaker Groon fight last

50
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,878
week, it was intentional that the Quivering Palm
ability was held back. He was testing individuals

51
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:33,575
in the battle, not trying to go lethal or kill. It
was more of a tease for the actual ability. God

52
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:41,234
forbid they ever come across a not quite as
helpful or restrained monk in the future. But I'm

53
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:45,331
well aware. It was intentional. I should've made
it more clear that he was holding back in the

54
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,605
moment and I apologize for the confusion it
caused.

55
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,421
TRAVIS: Hold on. He was holding back during that
whole thing?

56
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,646
MATT: Yeah.

57
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,620
TRAVIS: Cool. Awesome.

58
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,901
WILL: Somebody asked me about that too. I think my
response was, "What?" He keeps holding back! And

59
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,359
it's like, all right. I just want a good fight.

60
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,755
TRAVIS: Put my belly button with my spine.
That's holding back?

61
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:05,837
MATT: Yeah.

62
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:09,501
MARISHA: I love how that's part of the
announcements, though, you try to--

63
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:12,229
MATT: I'm just trying to quell it now, because
it's been perpetual and I'm like, I know. It's all

64
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,721
good.

65
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,902
WILL: It's a good fight!

66
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,864
MATT: It was a good fight. I love me some monks,
man. It was so great to bring a monk in there and

67
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:22,081
more hopefully to come, because there are those in
the world that are trained for different sets.

68
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:26,388
MARISHA: In fact, maybe now's a good time to
hearken back to your episode one announcement,

69
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:32,971
because it's been almost 50 since you've made the
announcement that you like to house rule a lot of

70
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,096
stuff.

71
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,550
MATT: Yeah. House rules, rules are fluid, you have
a good time. But don't worry about it. I know that

72
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,479
you guys want to see it come out in all its full
glory and that may still happen in the future. We

73
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,779
shall see.

74
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,576
MARY: You'll be a lycan-tiger monk or a lycan-rat
monk?

75
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,255
WILL: Wow.

76
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,351
MARY: Can you cross?

77
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,832
MATT: I mean, you could multiclass.

78
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,599
WILL: It sounds like something we would have on
ThunderCats.

79
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,116
MARY and MARISHA: Yeah!

80
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,779
TRAVIS: Snarf gets an upgrade.

81
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,603
WILL: Snarf-grade. Snarr!

82
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:00,277
(laughter)

83
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,369
TRAVIS: The quivering snarf.

84
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,412
MATT: The quivering snarf?

85
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:05,981
WILL: The quivering snarf.

86
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:10,552
MATT: That's a great romance novel descriptor. As
he lies there, his quivering snarf in the

87
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:15,045
moonlight-- All right. So that I think is all my
announcements. You guys have anything else you

88
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:17,415
want to talk about before we jump into the Q&A?

89
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,443
TRAVIS: This cookie's good.

90
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:24,329
MARY: Oh! Steve Blum and I are going to be at
CoastCon next weekend, not this weekend. The next

91
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,530
weekend in Biloxi so come on out and say hi!

92
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:34,613
WILL: Nice! March 17th, I will be in Toronto at
the big con up there. So that's going to be a lot

93
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,989
of fun. So come out Canada and come chill out. It
will be a good time.

94
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,973
MATT: Fantastic! Go check him out there. And me
and Marisha--

95
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,298
MARISHA: We leave next week.

96
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:45,286
MATT: We leave next week. We'll be gone from the
2nd to the 9th in Ireland. We'll be at a

97
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,758
convention at Kaizoku Con in Cork, Ireland
which--

98
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,074
WILL: Say that three times fast.

99
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:52,786
MATT: Kaizoku Con in Cork, Ireland, Kaizoku Con in
Cork, Ireland, Kaizuku Con in Cork-- no.

100
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,492
(screaming)

101
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,307
MARY: That was so close!

102
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,997
WILL: It's always the C take!

103
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:01,131
MARY: Yeah, you get cocky on the C take and you're
out.

104
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:06,424
MATT: That's a problem. But yeah, so there will
not be an episode next week because we'll be gone

105
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,592
but we'll be returning to the next proper session
which will also have the return of Will and Mary

106
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:18,118
as well to finish off that arc on March 10th, I
believe? So we'll be doing that. Anything else?

107
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:22,804
You good? Oh, that's right. And we'll be giving
away two copies of these books throughout tonight.

108
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:30,025
Brandon Sanderson's The Bands of Mourning. That is
not me on the cover as the Internet likes to

109
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:32,149
perpetually point out.

110
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:37,818
WILL: Can I say something? Because Brandon
Sanderson is my favorite author, bar none. These

111
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:40,681
books are incredible. They're amazing. You should
read everything he does. These are all from

112
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:46,510
Mistborn-- they start with the Mistborn trilogy.
They go from there. These are standalone novels

113
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,235
that take place after everything you knew about
Vin and everybody else. They are incredible so

114
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,240
these are a really cool prize.

115
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,094
TRAVIS: Laura says the same thing and I think it
was Kit Buss' art of those novels that we saw

116
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,267
first and we're like, oh, she's an amazing
artist!

117
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:05,478
MATT: Yeah. Thank you, Brandon Sanderson for
bringing us our main artist on Critical Role! So

118
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,788
yeah, we'll be giving these out throughout the
show tonight--

119
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:26,787
MARISHA: Along with those giveaways, with
Lootcrate I did an Espionage nail-wrap tutorial

120
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:36,251
and Jamie hooked me up and gave me a few Critical
Hit nail wraps. Yeah, you can go see how easy and

121
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:41,992
awesome it is. Actually, someone asked me at the
Con this weekend if I was a paid sponsor, like

122
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:47,465
paid promoter for Espionage. And the answer is no.
Ashley Johnson and I actually, legitimately,

123
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:56,823
really love their products and are huge fans. I'm
just a legit fan. I think I tweeted the link

124
00:07:56,823 --> 00:08:03,174
yesterday. I'm going to go tweet it out and go
check out Espionage Cosmetics. They're great.

125
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:04,549
MATT: Do it.

126
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,877
TRAVIS: Those go on your nails?

127
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,886
MARISHA: I have some on right now.

128
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,721
MATT: They can. You can certainly try.

129
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,751
WILL: Is that what those are? So that's not
paint?

130
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,472
MARISHA: No, that's not paint. They're these.
They're nail wraps and you stick them on. They're

131
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:19,827
like stickers and you put clear coat on them and
they last two weeks.

132
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,104
TRAVIS: No, they don't!

133
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:22,900
WILL: No. I don't deserve it.

134
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,238
MARY: You could demonstrate on Will.

135
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,864
MARISHA: I could, yeah. I could. You want to
demonstrate? I need a nail file.

136
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:32,026
WILL: You're going to need more than nail file.
Some kind of a big thing.

137
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:34,036
TRAVIS: (chainsaw sounds)

138
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:37,920
MARISHA: I demonstrate in the tutorial. But
they're really great! And actually do make some

139
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,233
for dudes, as well. They make some that are like
gender neutral.

140
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,973
WILL: Okay. I'm not a big nail-guy, but all
right.

141
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,656
MATT: I'm not either, but I've worn before.

142
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:48,358
TRAVIS: It's gender neutral. Is it really for
dudes?

143
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:52,093
MATT: It's for everybody. Yeah, Marisha.

144
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,745
TRAVIS: Come on.

145
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:56,926
MARISHA: Yeah. Semantics. All right.

146
00:08:56,926 --> 00:09:01,558
MATT: All right. So that being the case, the first
half of this evening is going to be a general Q&A,

147
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:05,058
guys. We're going to be poring through the
Reddit, we're going to be trying to keep up with

148
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,617
the chat room to answer what questions we can, so
feel free. If you see something come by the chat

149
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,845
room on the side there, guys, if you caught
something that seems like a fun question to

150
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,603
answer, feel free to jump out and take it if
somebody's in the middle of explaining--

151
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,101
TRAVIS: Are you serious? That thing moves like The
Matrix screen.

152
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,992
MATT and MARY: I know.

153
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,623
WILL: I just like, Matthew, you're dreamy.

154
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,879
RYAN: We're pasting a lot of questions that come
up.

155
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,097
MATT: Great.

156
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,720
TRAVIS: Oh, there's an emoji thing!

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,180
MATT: Ryan will be helping with this.

158
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,273
MARISHA: So good.

159
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,904
MATT: There it goes.

160
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,650
MARISHA: Hey, where's Wendy? We could bring Wendy
out.

161
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,836
MATT and MARY: Yeah. Where's Wendy?

162
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,415
RYAN: I'm going to go get her.

163
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,172
MATT: We're going to pull her real fast, see if
you guys say hi to Wendy. She is one of our

164
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:46,075
official Critical Role artists. She did all the
artwork for our fantastic story of Vox Machina

165
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:49,738
pre-stream video and for the show.

166
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:52,685
MARISHA: She also did all the art for the Winter's
Crest Festival.

167
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,050
WILL: Yay!

168
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,641
MARY: She's wearing the best t-shirt ever.

169
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:59,624
(cheering)

170
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,568
TRAVIS and MARY: Hi Wendy!

171
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,772
MARISHA: We're getting a chair for you. Here you
go, scooch up a little bit.

172
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:11,253
MATT: Ryan! You want to start throwing questions
out?

173
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,666
RYAN: I have to frame her up and then I can do
questions.

174
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,061
MATT: Perfect! In the meantime, I'll start with
some--

175
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,140
MARISHA: Do it all at once, damn it!

176
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:24,924
MATT: Some of the Reddit questions we have ready
to go. PregosFearStaircases on Reddit.

177
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:29,105
ALL: PregosFearStaircases?

178
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:33,702
TRAVIS: Can we just talk about how that's the best
name I've heard all day? That's amazing!

179
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:35,000
MARY: Better than Bonertown?

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,445
TRAVIS: Well, Bonertown's a classic.

181
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:39,697
MATT: What does the PCs do for prep? I notice dry
erase markers for temporary hit points. Do they

182
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:44,535
lay out their spell cards or have them typed up on
one page? What do you guys do to prep for a game?

183
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:54,620
TRAVIS: Well, there's many hours of meditation and
reflection that goes into what Professor Grog is

184
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,983
going to do next. Or you can tattoo "impulse" on
my forehead; that would probably be it.

185
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:08,259
MARISHA: Does it need to be that clear? Nothing.
Yeah, how do they mean?

186
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,655
MARY: Do you go through your spells and stuff?

187
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,347
MARISHA: Clearly not.

188
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:23,630
WILL: You guys also know them so well by now that--
We're learning, so we're there going like-- most

189
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:30,244
of my prep is calling you and saying, "What can I
do at level four?" That's what I do because we

190
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:35,171
watch you guys and it's like, "All right, they
know everything." I didn't know any of this stuff.

191
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:36,933
You know it better than I do.

192
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:43,870
MARY: I feel like I'm cramming for an exam. It's a
constant school nightmare of, "I'm not wearing

193
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,744
"pants and I didn't study!"

194
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,846
WILL: "And there's a dragon in front of me and I
don't know how to kill it!"

195
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,225
MARY: Hellish something!

196
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,019
MATT: The classic school argument.

197
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,331
WILL: Exactly!

198
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:55,130
MARISHA: I guess I sometimes try and go back and watch
the end of the last episode so I can remember

199
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,345
where we were.

200
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:57,900
WILL: Like Breaking Bad?

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,059
MARISHA: Yeah!

202
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,348
WILL: Nice.

203
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:05,139
MARISHA: I also have all my spells on little
cards. I've got a few spell references: I've got

204
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:15,960
the book, cards, and spreadsheets. I have dry erase
markers and my notebooks, endless notebooks. I've

205
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,541
become the token party notetaker of the group.

206
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,716
TRAVIS: You're very organized.

207
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:27,399
MATT: And every now and then we still get a Wind
Walk. as much as we prep, we still sometimes don't

208
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,484
get it right.

209
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:34,312
MARY: The question was for the playable
characters, but how much time do you put in?

210
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:41,722
MATT: Per week, I put at least as much time in
prep as we do playing. So from like three, four

211
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:46,788
hours plus a week into prepping for each one of
our games. That involves, not just prepping for

212
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:51,232
that session, but also writing ahead, planning for
future elements that might tie into events, seeing

213
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:57,245
how things that happened last session will affect,
ripple down the line, and trying to make sure that

214
00:12:57,245 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm not completely caught off-guard. Not that it
ever helps; I'm always completely caught

215
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,034
off-guard. But it makes me feel better and sleep
at night during the week.

216
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,094
TRAVIS: It's kind of great because we have this
endless resource of people who are going to let

217
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:12,084
you know when you miss or forget something. So
it's like, what's the point of prepping because an

218
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:17,222
hour after the show I have 500 people going, "You
might have forgotten about that!" Yep, never even

219
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:18,526
thought about it.

220
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:23,420
MATT: It's like having a wave of Clippy the
paperclip. "Um!"

221
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,910
MARISHA: "Uh, by the way!"

222
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,986
MATT: It looks to me like you're trying to use
Reckless Attacks!

223
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,804
WILL: Did you mean Quivering Palm?

224
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:34,072
TRAVIS: To be clear, I like that it is there, so
please keep it coming otherwise I might not

225
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,360
remember any of that stuff.

226
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,756
MARISHA: See, I have a bunch of people shouting
spells at me that I should do, that I may or may

227
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:45,788
not have learned because druids work-- do druids
work like clerics where we learn spells at the top

228
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,425
of the day? Do clerics work like that?

229
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:52,029
MATT: Yeah, same way where you choose the ones you
have memorized, prepared and then you can choose

230
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,310
from that list.

231
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,448
TRAVIS: How many do you get?

232
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,007
MARISHA: Like 17.

233
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,889
TRAVIS: 17 spells?!

234
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:00,843
MARY: But you can only choose between how many per
day?

235
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:10,268
MARISHA: Well, I can choose 17 that I have total,
and then I have four 1st-level spell slots, three

236
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:16,766
2nd-level, three 3rd-level, three 4th-level, two
5th-level, one 6th-level and one 7th-level that I

237
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:28,328
can use. So, theoretically, I could learn ten
level four spells, but I only have three slots

238
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:34,053
that I can use of those ten. So I have 17 spells
that I can learn that I can pull from my entire

239
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:44,681
list, which is like 100 spells, but I have to
balance it out. So I have four 1st-level spell

240
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:52,493
slots that I can burn, so I try to pick three to
four first level spells that I learn at the top of

241
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:58,499
the day. So when people are shouting at me over
the internet going, "Keyleth, Polymorph Trinket!

242
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:05,042
"Polymorph him!" I don't necessarily have it
learned. I have to learn every time at the top of

243
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:05,981
the day.

244
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:07,328
TRAVIS: You also don't hear them.

245
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:13,682
WILL: I did, because I had Wil Wheaton going,
"Turn undead! Why aren't you turning undead?"

246
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:18,997
Because I don't fucking know what that means! What
are you talking about? That's what I had. That was

247
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,702
my prep. You have the whole internet. I had him
yelling at me.

248
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:27,049
MATT: Now, that's my high school nightmare. Wil
Wheaton in my ear the whole time.

249
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:32,116
MARY: Stop rolling ones. Oh.

250
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,566
TRAVIS: Yeah.

251
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,163
MARY: Sorry, Wil. I love you.

252
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:40,668
MATT: All right, so see if we can find another
question coming up here.

253
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:43,081
MARISHA: I saw someone ask if Wendy was going to
play with us.

254
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,491
WENDY: That is up to you guys.

255
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,499
(laughter)

256
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:53,186
MATT: Good to know. It's an interesting balance
for the show, because for Critical Role, it's the

257
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:59,666
story of Vox Machina. I'm trying to not turn it
into a guest-of-the-week show. This is why I'm

258
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,988
very sparing with storylines and bringing guests
in. You guys I brought in for the Slayer's Take,

259
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:06,273
and this was the right time to bring you guys back
for a bit. We'll have a couple more guests coming

260
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:12,730
in next month, it looks like, but I don't want to
make it too constant. We may have you in as a

261
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,508
guest in the future. It may not be very soon, but
it's good to know that you're interested.

262
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:19,254
WENDY: I would be honored.

263
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:25,731
MATT: Okay. Yeah, we will have guests
occasionally. Occasionally, because this is the

264
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:26,974
story of the core party.

265
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,682
TRAVIS: Yeah.

266
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:31,917
WILL: It should be. It's the way it should be.

267
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:34,430
MATT: We could do a spinoff with guests only or
something. I don't know.

268
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,296
WILL: We're already talking about it. You guys
have Thursday nights. We'll pre-you. We'll do

269
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:43,755
Wednesday night, and we'll have our own show.
It'll be fine. Just the two of us going, "I don't know."

270
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:49,087
MARY: "I don't know. I burned my three spells. Can
we wait an hour? I need a short rest."

271
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,197
WILL: And Wil's voiceover going, "Turn undead!"

272
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,825
MATT: There's no dungeon master.

273
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,457
WILL: There's no dungeon master at all!

274
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:59,563
MARY: That's all I remember: Hellish Rebuke. What
a day! I'm out.

275
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,248
MATT: That would be amazing.

276
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,110
MARY: We're going to get a home game.

277
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,586
WILL: We have other friends that really want to
play, so we're going to start playing, probably

278
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:10,789
getting a game together a week, and it's some
interesting people that want to join us.

279
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,614
MARY: If we can get one of them to get in town for
longer than a day.

280
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:19,263
WILL: We've got some cool people that want to join
our little club, so you guys have definitely

281
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:22,450
inspired us, which is good.

282
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,977
MARY: So much so that Liam has said, "Can we come
and watch?"

283
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,994
WILL: That's going to be fun.

284
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:35,833
MATT: Let's see. This is an interesting question.
From Raquem on Reddit: Do you or anyone ever get

285
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,544
tired of this being broadcast and wish you could
go back to your more personal game? While a lot of

286
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:42,080
good has come out of Critical Role in terms of
exposure, do you find the invasive nature of the

287
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,559
internet to be difficult to handle? Would you have
a problem saying, "Okay, we're done now. Thanks,

288
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,933
"Geek and Sundry. Thanks, everyone, and see you
later."

289
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,912
That was our fear when we first started the show,
and it was a very real fear, because taking

290
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:58,661
something that's so personal to us and putting it
on the internet is one, a risk; two, a danger,

291
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,180
having the internet come out and set fire to it
and tell you that your fun is wrong.

292
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,282
WILL: Your fun is wrong! I want that shirt.

293
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:10,083
(laughter)

294
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:17,343
MATT: I don't speak for everyone here, but while
that was our fear, in practice, I'm pleasantly

295
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:22,392
surprised that was never the case. The community
that's sprung out of this is so supportive and so

296
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:27,693
positive. Even the exceptions are people that are
passionate enough to want a voice and to feel

297
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:33,039
involved. There's not the hate that we were
expecting from it, and it hasn't really changed

298
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,993
how we play the game or our experience with it. We
enjoy it just the same. It may not be as close

299
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:42,957
physically, and the map proximity to the players
is something we're still working on getting

300
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,822
better, but other than that--

301
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:50,829
WILL: That's a question I would have, then. You
guys play Dungeons and Dragons, and it's a ton of

302
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,961
fun, and everybody's having a great time, but at
your core, you're all entertainers. We're all

303
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:59,049
entertainers; that's what we do. How much of any
of it has changed because now there's an audience?

304
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:03,310
Everything changes when there's an audience.
There's an audience, and you're entertainers.

305
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,460
That's what you do.

306
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,171
MARY: Or do you forget about it? At this point,
forget that the cameras are there, and you--

307
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,937
MATT: That's more the case. If there was a live
audience, it's hard not to, and as a stage

308
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,858
performer, you draw energy from the audience, and
it's a mutual sharing.

309
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:18,896
WILL: You do for the cameras, too, though. You
might forget that the cameras are there, but you

310
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:22,372
always forget that the cameras are there while
knowing exactly where the cameras are. That's how

311
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:27,331
we are as performers. The cameras are gone, but
you know exactly where you have to look. I've

312
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,221
totally forgotten that the camera's there, but I
know it's right there.

313
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:35,231
MATT: It's become a layer of it. I wouldn't say
it's impeded or changed our experience. At least,

314
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,373
not for me.

315
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:43,450
MARISHA: We seem to become more committed, maybe.
We try not to dick around in between. At home,

316
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,266
we'd go, "Hang on, I've got to go. Can we take 45
minutes for a break?"

317
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:54,197
TRAVIS: Did we? I think those were some pretty
marathon six-hour sessions. We would break off for

318
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,607
whispers.

319
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,793
MATT: But there would be catching up on shit you
did during the week.

320
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:03,084
TRAVIS: We were pretty slap-dickish when we were
playing, and I think we've carried that through

321
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,340
pretty nicely.

322
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,479
MATT: This is true.

323
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,628
MARISHA: I think we were pretty selfish in wanting
to entertain ourselves.

324
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:17,461
TRAVIS: That's true. It's weird, because Sam's
such a great improv person, Liam's got crazy

325
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:24,331
theater experience, so everybody knows to honor
moments, when to be quiet, when not to. The timing

326
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:29,932
is such a great thing among the cast. We're all
friends, so there's no trying to figure each other out.

327
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:33,693
MARISHA: I feel like all that was there before the
show. That was all there.

328
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:43,052
MATT: It's a lot of luck that we had those
relationships beforehand, and making that momentum

329
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:48,447
in the game before we put it on camera. What
things may have changed have been so minimal by

330
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,122
comparison that I haven't noticed too much of a
difference, personally.

331
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:57,809
WILL: I was saying, it would be a cool experiment
to have you dungeon master a game with a group of

332
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,767
people that have never played before.

333
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:02,067
MATT: I've done it. On camera.

334
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:09,527
WILL: That would be really interesting. It's like
being on any other cast, where after a while, you

335
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:14,776
know what your fellow cast member's going to do.
In a certain way, you know what's going to happen.

336
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:19,163
It'd be interesting where it's six people who have
never met before: go.

337
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:23,275
TRAVIS: That was like that D & Diesel thing,
because he had played years ago, but Chobot and

338
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:27,464
Dan were new to it, and when you sit down and
you're happy-go-lucky about it, and you drop into

339
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:32,637
your dungeon master thing, people are like, "Oh
shit, this is real."

340
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,951
(laughter)

341
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:40,566
TRAVIS: It's the perfect tone-setter.

342
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:47,948
MATT: That will be one of my shining moments of my
entire career, was looking over at Vin fucking

343
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:52,091
Diesel, this burly Fast and Furious guy.

344
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,326
TRAVIS: Tiny arms.

345
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:55,536
(laughter)

346
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:59,201
TRAVIS: He sat down. It was like, (thuds).

347
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,413
(laughter)

348
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:05,582
MATT: I shook his hand when he got there. I was
like, "Hi."

349
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:10,083
MARISHA: I still remember the camera guys were
like, "All right, Diesel, sit in frame." He was

350
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:15,713
like (thud) and the camera guy's like, "Let me
just scoot the camera back a little bit, adjust

351
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,544
"the focus."

352
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:22,932
MATT: That was the defining moment, watching that
arrive. He was so nice and so cordial and so much

353
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:26,398
fun and open to it, and then he sat down, and as
soon as we started, looking over and seeing this

354
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:28,723
burly man turn into an eight-year-old--

355
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:33,728
MARY: Completely. And you could see it on camera.
It was amazing. And then to see him slowly and

356
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,673
eventually come out of that shell and gain
confidence and remember what it was like to play

357
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,414
this at his age now.

358
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:40,829
TRAVIS: Those criticals didn't hurt, either.

359
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,145
MARY: No, it was so awesome!

360
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,583
MATT: His luck was ridiculous. We only had 25
minutes to play that game, which they cut down

361
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:50,203
from an hour when we got there. I was like,
"okay!" I was so afraid he would roll shitty and

362
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:54,152
have a terrible time, but he rolled really well,
and I was like, "Yes, thank you."

363
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:56,693
TRAVIS: Thank you, RNG Jesus.

364
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:59,187
WILL: I also have to say-- I don't know if you
actually saw the movie-- it was fun.

365
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,686
TRAVIS: Yes!

366
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:06,395
WILL: It was fun! It really was. I watched it two
nights ago. I had fun.

367
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:09,256
TRAVIS: First five or ten minutes, I was like,
"this is going to be a great movie."

368
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,946
(laughter)

369
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:13,168
WILL: They made a movie just for me.

370
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:20,354
MATT: Travis, do you and Laura even break into
character at home during stressful situations to

371
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:21,614
lighten the mood?

372
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:27,203
TRAVIS: Shit, no. Laura is already rolling her
eyes enough at Grog that if I tried to be that

373
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:34,971
stupid at home, she'd be like, "Fucking stop." She
wouldn't let that fly. We talk to each other in

374
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:41,902
weird voices, almost never our own, but if I tried
to talk as Grog, I would get dragon eyes of death.

375
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:45,245
I'd get smarter real fast.

376
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,332
WILL: I would like to slap you. Roll a dexterity
saving throw.

377
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:52,906
MARY: Feel better, Laura.

378
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:58,268
MATT: Hope you feel better. Ryan, do we have any
burning questions in the chat room?

379
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:00,568
RYAN: I have eight pages.

380
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:05,798
MATT: Do you want to toss one out? Toss one out
there we can maybe tackle?

381
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:08,646
RYAN: I can also just give you the damn thing.

382
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,435
MATT: Also viable, but I like hearing your voice.

383
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:14,358
TRAVIS: Lob it. Softball that bad boy.

384
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:20,318
RYAN: Red Sea Logos: does the positive outweigh
the negative on the internet? Does it make it

385
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:25,215
worth it? Because we love you guys. I'm assuming
they're referring to comments from people and the

386
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:29,662
community that have been developed. Does the
positive outweigh the negative?

387
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:34,801
MATT: Far. Far far far. The negative is so
comparatively miniscule in comparison to that

388
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:38,402
positive energy that you guys continuously
generate. Not just around the show, but this

389
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:44,707
entire Twitch channel and everyone that works hard
on it. It's been overwhelming. That was my biggest

390
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:48,723
fear, that the internet was going to come in and
go, "No!" and stab me in the chest. Don't do that,

391
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:55,844
please. No. I've already answered the question
from my perspective. It's been so overwhelmingly

392
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:56,626
positive.

393
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:59,038
TRAVIS: It's really such a weird thing to be
positive all the way across, and if you're not, we

394
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,134
mute you.

395
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:06,787
WILL: I still want the "your fun is wrong" shirt.
Your fun is wrong.

396
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:16,046
MARISHA: Even the people who get heated or upset,
they're getting heated and upset at our imaginary

397
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:25,485
characters that we made up in our heads, so at the
end of the day, it's still working. We're still

398
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:26,572
affecting them.

399
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:31,300
MATT: You guys are so invested in the play time to
have this much passion to yell about.

400
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,541
MARISHA: It makes them feel that.

401
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:39,546
MARY: Think about the effect that it's had
creatively on people. Let's talk to Wendy about

402
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:43,524
that. Come on, the artwork has been-- and the
fanfiction?

403
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:51,165
WILL: There was some fanfic this morning. I was
like, "What? Wait a minute, he's doing what? Why

404
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,958
"is he naked?!"

405
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,346
MARY: What am I doing with my tail?

406
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,445
WILL: Seriously, she's using her tail.

407
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:02,918
MARY: Who's driving? Okay. But in terms of
artwork, it's unbelievable.

408
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:09,345
WENDY: And your characters come to life so well,
and the world that you've painted is so vivid, so

409
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:12,406
it's easy to doodle it out.

410
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,614
TRAVIS: It's so great.

411
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,949
MARY: Wendy doodles.

412
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:20,230
MATT: It's not just artwork, too. There's people
that have produced incredible musical tracks, many

413
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,179
of which I've actually incorporated in our in-game
soundtracks. People that have sent fanfiction and

414
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:30,363
have gotten into writing heavily, some of them
because of the show. People tell us, "I haven't

415
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:37,930
"written in 15 years, and after watching the show,
I'm working on a new novel." It's much bigger than

416
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,400
us, at this point.

417
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,349
WILL: That's cool, though. That's what you want.
That's when everybody's imagination takes over,

418
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:46,422
and it goes to a whole other level. The same thing
happens with fantasy baseball. It's that kind of

419
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,094
thing. It started with a bunch of people around
the table, then everybody takes it and do whatever

420
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,247
they want.

421
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:55,148
MATT: It's music. It's doing what you love and
inspiring other people to do what they love, and

422
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:58,326
there are many people that inspired me to do this
and things before this, and it's great to continue

423
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:02,524
that chain, to do honor to those that inspire me
to continue to do the things that I love, and

424
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,324
hopefully continue that chain.

425
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:05,435
MARISHA: Beyond that--

426
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:08,219
TRAVIS: No, sorry. I had an art question.

427
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:16,402
MARISHA: I know you guys, you were saying you talk
with Kit and Meg all the time, and we were having

428
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:22,871
the conversation not long ago. All of our official
artists thus far, one's in Los Angeles, one's in

429
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:28,105
the UK, in London, one is in-- where's Joma?

430
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,083
MARY: The Philippines.

431
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,572
MARISHA: The Philippines. The other's in the
Philippines.

432
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:35,674
MARY: And Viktor is in--

433
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:39,851
MARISHA: He's in Sweden. All of our official
artists have been on different continents, which

434
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,247
is crazy.

435
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:44,572
MATT: Mikandi's in the Middle East.

436
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:47,492
MARISHA: Yeah, Mikandi's in the Middle East.
That's right.

437
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:50,646
MATT: We have people all over the world. It's
incredible. And people creating their own

438
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:54,383
adventures and sending us pictures and stories
from their own home games, and art of their

439
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:56,230
characters. It's so cool!

440
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,433
MARY: Anything that spawns that kind of creativity
is amazing.

441
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:04,014
WENDY: Creativity spawning creativity. Sorry.

442
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:09,675
TRAVIS: If you come up with a sketch, do you ever
stop and start and stop and start, or is it what

443
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:15,118
hits the page is eventually what comes up? We see
so much art, and rarely do we ever go, "No, that's

444
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:17,467
"not how I saw it." We're like, "Yes. Also yes!"

445
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:24,713
WENDY: I know sometimes I'll be watching and
sometimes I sit there and wait for a really cool

446
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:31,880
moment to come up, and then, "Bam! There it is.
I've got to get that down." My job is to put what

447
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,449
happens visually, so it just comes to me, I guess.
Sometimes it doesn't work. I'll sketch something

448
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:43,148
out, and it doesn't look right, so I'll have to do
it again, but what I put up, yeah.

449
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:47,594
TRAVIS: It's so cool. It's like a crystal ball.

450
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:52,164
WILL: One of the things you guys have also done,
in a weird way, is you've given people permission

451
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:58,745
to do this, if that makes any sense. I've talked
to certain people who have been like, "Yeah, I've

452
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:01,916
"played D&D forever, but we don't really talk about
it." Literally, people are like, "We don't bring

453
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:05,989
"it up; we don't talk about it. It's our thing.
There's six or seven of us. Nobody really tells

454
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:11,225
"their friends about it. We just do our thing." And
now, we watch that show and we talk about it! It's

455
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:17,096
permission to go, "Yeah, we nerd out. It's the
greatest thing in the world, and it's so much

456
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:20,997
"fun!" I think a lot of it is you guys doing that,
where it's a show.

457
00:29:20,997 --> 00:29:29,555
MARY: It's improv. I never knew what it was! The
first time I played was here, and I was like, "Oh

458
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:34,320
"my gosh! I studied this in grad school and
college. It's improv."

459
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,762
WILL: With wizards.

460
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:36,804
MARY: With wizards!

461
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:38,205
WILL: It can't get better than that.

462
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:42,734
MARY: Can I do it? Sure, roll. Okay. So then
there's gambling.

463
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:45,159
(laughter)

464
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,769
MARY: Yelling at my dice! It's craps and improv
and amazingness.

465
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:54,878
MATT: It feels like-- I mentioned this at
Portland-- it feels like being part of Fight Club.

466
00:29:54,878 --> 00:30:01,796
I was going through TSA when we were coming back
from Portland, Oregon. I'm going through TSA, and

467
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:06,232
the guy comes out with the laptop, because it gets
picked up from the side, and the guy has the

468
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:12,173
gloves on, and he pulls it off and looks at it and
hands it back to me and goes, "Here you go. Also

469
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:21,004
"had to stop your buddy Scanlan earlier." I was
like, "What?" And I go back, and Sam, who had

470
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:24,122
already gone through, tells me that yeah, he had
some of his checked, and the guy hands it to him

471
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,038
and goes, "Your bag, Scanlan Shorthalt."

472
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:27,753
(laughter)

473
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:31,783
MATT: People all throughout the world that sit
down and watch the show, and they keep it all

474
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:34,552
secret and put little comments off to the side,
and it's incredible.

475
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:39,126
MARISHA: And two days later, the Hollywood
Pantages tweeted, "Scanlan just walked the red

476
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:40,007
"carpet."

477
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,432
MATT: Yeah, the Hollywood Pantages.

478
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:45,564
MARISHA: The Pantages. Whoever runs social for
Pantages watches Critical Role.

479
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:50,572
MATT: So hi, if it's you. I had a bartender at the
Echoplex when we were there for Booty LA one

480
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:55,613
night, and I went to order some drinks, and he
goes, "Sure. Do you play Dungeons & Dragons on the

481
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:57,023
"internet?"

482
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:01,414
MARISHA: Which is very jarring when you're
drenched in sweat, and you're like, (untz untz

483
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:04,504
untz). Someone's like, "D&D?" and you're like--

484
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:07,424
MATT: It was awesome.

485
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:08,989
MARISHA: I feel really sober now.

486
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:10,258
WILL: That's cool.

487
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:14,257
MATT: Next question. Are there any you've chosen
there?

488
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:18,877
MARISHA: Someone asked: would you recommend
playing a game with friends or finding a group

489
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,429
made up of strangers?

490
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:26,947
MATT: You can go either way. I would recommend, if
you haven't played before and have any level of

491
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:30,007
self-consciousness about it, try and find friends
and people you're comfortable with to try it out

492
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:35,891
for the first time. If you don't find that much of
a social problem with engaging new things with

493
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,911
people you don't know, you can definitely give it
a shot, and if it turns out not being your thing,

494
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:43,348
if it's at a premade game with strangers, then you
can go back and try and find friends to play, and

495
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,775
if your friends are like, "I don't know how D&D
works," send them an episode of Critical Role.

496
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:52,419
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's a guy we know that plays at
Emerald Knights, and I forget what night they have

497
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:53,504
D&D nights--

498
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:54,628
MATT: Wednesday nights.

499
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:57,124
TRAVIS: Wednesday nights. He showed up a couple of
times to play with one group, and then he hopped

500
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,190
in some rando group and was totally nervous about
it, but he was like, "It was the best game I've

501
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:06,030
"ever played," because nobody knew him or what he
was going to do, so he was free to make these wild

502
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,148
choices and be totally nuts. He was like, "It was
exhilarating!" I'm like, "D&D night was

503
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:14,899
"exhilarating?" He was like, "Yeah, man! It was
great!"

504
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:20,420
WILL: There's a place right near us that does
stuff like that. Fire & Dice, right near us.

505
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,056
TRAVIS: We're coming.

506
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:26,059
(laughter)

507
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:29,144
TRAVIS: Hello! Are you open?

508
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:34,097
MATT: That's a good question. Someone asked, how
did you guys decide on the name Critical Role for the show?

509
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:37,398
I think that was actually a Liam suggestion,
wasn't it? You and Liam were doing a few on that

510
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:38,592
one.

511
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:45,901
MARISHA: We had a text thread going. We had a few
different options that we were floating around.

512
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,849
MARY: What were the other ones?

513
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,943
TRAVIS: d20 Turds.

514
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:52,341
WILL: Prego Fear Staircases.

515
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:55,355
(laughter)

516
00:32:55,355 --> 00:33:01,254
MATT: Nothing But Doors. Doors Forever. I can't
remember some of the ones we had, but Critical

517
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:07,134
Role was the one that seemed to best encompass who
we are, where we come from, and it plays in with

518
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:13,558
the RPG theme, but also role-play, and us being
actors who play roles for a living. It put

519
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,475
everything together what we were, so that one
stood out.

520
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:22,121
MARISHA: I think Charisma Save was being tossed
around, but someone else already had that.

521
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:28,297
MATT: There's a lot of RPG-based names that
already exist! Strangely.

522
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:33,624
MARISHA: We were trying to do something around
Dice Box, or Dice Tube or something.

523
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:37,509
(laughter)

524
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:41,247
WILL: We did Andrew Dice Play for a while. That
wasn't working.

525
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:44,583
TRAVIS: Everybody gets a pop and do the glasses.

526
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:54,148
MARISHA: We had a few different ones. I have an
art question, so while Wendy is here, from

527
00:33:54,148 --> 00:34:03,404
Carbacca. Hey, Matt and the gang: What scenes do
you think you could describe or even act out--

528
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:06,984
that's not going to happen-- from before the
stream that you would like to see drawn by us

529
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:12,204
crazy fan artists, because there would be no "new
mewments"-- no new moments this week.

530
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:13,587
MARY: No nude movements?

531
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:14,861
MARISHA: No nude movements.

532
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,510
MATT: No, Twitter has proven that wrong.

533
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,801
MARISHA: Artists need something to draw.

534
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:21,799
TRAVIS: Pre-stream?

535
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:22,896
MATT and MARISHA: Pre-stream.

536
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:28,227
TRAVIS: I have one. So one of the first pranks
that Vax pulled on Grog was we were sleeping

537
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:35,129
around a campfire, and in the middle of the night,
Vax went over and wrote "dork" on Grog's forehead

538
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:41,195
with a piece of charcoal from the campfire, and
when I woke up-- we might've been drinking while

539
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:46,176
we were playing. When we woke up, I look in my
goblet in-game, and I see the reflection, and I

540
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:52,429
said, "Who wrote Kord on my face? ...Krod?"

541
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,681
(laughter)

542
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,912
TRAVIS: In character. Can't even spell it
backwards.

543
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:02,332
MATT: It's so good.

544
00:35:02,332 --> 00:35:04,785
TRAVIS: It was one of the first ones, and off went
the prank war.

545
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:12,538
MATT: There was that. And I remember, named after
that, you guys purchased an ox at one of the small

546
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:19,459
towns on your way out to Emon. It was near
Westruun. You purchased an ox that was useless,

547
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:20,868
and you named it Dork the ox.

548
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,322
TRAVIS: We were going to use him as a sacrifice.

549
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:23,699
WILL: Dork the ox?

550
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:27,702
MARISHA: And we tried to interrogate him, because
we were hoping he would know stuff--

551
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,963
MATT: Speak to Animals. The ox was just like--

552
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,088
MARISHA: He was like, "I'm a cow. I don't know
shit."

553
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:38,973
MATT: It was similar to you interrogating the cows
in the later episode. You learned so much from the

554
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:44,128
first time. As you started to travel, because Dork
doesn't travel very well, Grog took it upon

555
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:49,631
himself to find a way to cram him into the bag of
holding, which took a series of strength checks

556
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:52,470
and tensile checks to see that the bag didn't
burst in the process.

557
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,112
TRAVIS: It's like in Hermione's handbag.

558
00:35:54,112 --> 00:36:00,002
MATT: He wasn't a huge ox, but he was still
growing up. Managed to push him in there, and this

559
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:03,281
was also the sad lesson when they reached the next
town to realize that the bag of holding does not

560
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:06,581
have a perpetual air supply, and that was the end
of Dork the ox.

561
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:12,433
TRAVIS: Dork was toast. We pull him out. This
giant carcass fell out.

562
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,475
WILL: Poke holes in the bag for Dork.

563
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:17,609
MARY: At least you ate well that night.

564
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:22,912
TRAVIS: I was like, "Oh shit!" And we butchered
him, and we put him back in little pieces, but

565
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,612
then we also learned that the bag of holding is
not refrigerated, so three months later, I pull it

566
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:35,501
out, and this gelatinous ooze comes sliding out.
We're like, "Has it coated everything else in

567
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:36,737
"there?"

568
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,469
"Let's say no."

569
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:43,540
MATT: Oh man. What are some other great moments
from pre-stream?

570
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,931
MARISHA: Two years' worth.

571
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,523
MATT: The most serious one was Pike's death.

572
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,067
MARY: That's what I was going to say.

573
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:53,177
MATT: Pike being killed in the throne room. I
think your artwork in the pre-stream video,

574
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,535
wonderfully done with the shadow against the
wall.

575
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,799
TRAVIS: We were not expecting that.

576
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,939
MATT: Yeah, that was the glabrezu, the treachery
demon, getting the killing blow on Pike as the

577
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,200
whole party watched on and crumpled to their
knees.

578
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,780
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ashley literally pulled her shirt up
to her eyes, and Laura sat under the table

579
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,749
MARISHA: Yeah, in the fetal position.

580
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:17,175
TRAVIS: They were both crying, and the rest of us
were in shock. What? We do what? What happened?

581
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:24,973
MARISHA: It was really sad. We always remember the
time we discovered the magic carpet, too, because

582
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:32,968
that was so good. It was so epic. Allura's tower,
which we've seen now happen on game, right, her

583
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:34,512
tower implode?

584
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:43,937
MATT: Well, Allura's tower has a specific magical
defense, where it can crush itself into a small

585
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:51,711
extra-dimensional space and then rebuild itself.
However, the recent attack on the tower was not

586
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:58,382
part of the defense mechanism. That was Vorugal
actually destroying the tower, so what you saw

587
00:37:58,382 --> 00:38:03,658
recently in Emon was the end of Allura's tower,
which is unfortunate.

588
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:10,888
Great question here, and this pertains to you and
technically, you. Romance between player

589
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:16,541
characters is not something you see in a lot of
games. This is by Gore Ax on reddit. Liam said in

590
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:20,021
an interview that he approached you first about
the possibility of adding romance to the game.

591
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:25,273
What advice did you give to him or would you give
to DMs and players about that subject? Also, since

592
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:27,964
you knew about Vax's interest in Keyleth months
before Marisha, did that ever create an awkward

593
00:38:27,964 --> 00:38:30,189
moment that you had to play dumb about it?

594
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:36,416
Interesting question. I think romance in game is
an interesting storytelling facet. I think it's

595
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:39,890
been a phenomenal thread in our game, and it's
driven a lot of great character moments, and it's

596
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:46,684
brought some needed realism to both Vax and
Keyleth's relationship. It's been really cool.

597
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:52,486
You do have to be respectful, and you have to make
sure that the game group is mature enough to

598
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:58,573
handle that. That would involve one, talking with
the players and the DM before it happens. In this

599
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:02,322
situation, Liam talked to me without talking to
Marisha because he wasn't sure if he wanted to

600
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:05,807
pursue it or not. He just wanted to make sure it
wouldn't be weird for me, and as we're actors, and

601
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:10,775
we trust we understand the separation between
character and ourselves, that was never an issue.

602
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:12,659
I was very comfortable with Liam.

603
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,436
But not all games will be like that, and some
people might have jealousy issues, so you want to

604
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:20,628
make sure before you even pursue anything like
that that you talk to everyone involved and make

605
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:23,967
sure that it's cool. It's not necessary, and it
can be a really cool facet if everybody treats it

606
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,169
like that.

607
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:28,661
And romance doesn't have to be a very melodramatic
thing, either. It could be an element of the

608
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:33,504
flavor. It could be a flirtation you carry on and
is an off-camera thing that gets mentioned here

609
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:37,510
and there. It doesn't have to be that you sit
there at the precipice of a cliff declaring your

610
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,069
love for 30 minutes while the other players gag
themselves in the corner.

611
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:44,622
WILL: You could just kiss her and leave. That's
what I did. Kiss her and walk out the door.

612
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:48,476
MARISHA: Cowboy in the sunset.

613
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:51,329
WILL: By the way, I probably should've asked you
about that. Do you mind if I kiss her and then

614
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,344
leave?

615
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:55,032
MATT: No, it was a great moment! I knew you were
leaving.

616
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:57,548
(laughter)

617
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:59,575
WILL: Exactly. I knew you were out.

618
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:04,098
MATT: It's cool, too, because some romances
succeed and become a cool driving moment for the

619
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:08,550
character to try and protect the one they care
about. Many romances fail and end up leading to an

620
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,103
interesting tension between the characters. I'm
excited to see where this goes, because it could

621
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:17,858
go either way. There's been a lot of interesting
perspectives here. What I like about your guys'

622
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:23,353
romance is it's very realistic in the sense that
it isn't an immediate grasping each other, and

623
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,391
it's perfect. Both of you are broken people, and
you're both trying to still figure out whatever

624
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:31,654
this is, and Keyleth's very unsure, and you're
both feeling out the circumstance in the midst of

625
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:36,011
this apocalyptic chaos. I find it fascinating.

626
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:40,607
WILL: And then Kash comes back in the middle to
add a little-- that's how life works! It's

627
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,501
absolutely how life works, though.

628
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,982
MARISHA: Because you know Kash was Keyleth's first
kiss, right?

629
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:46,761
WILL: Yeah. It's one of those things.

630
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:51,834
MARY: And it doesn't have to be this bang, bong
thing. The most beautiful moment, I think, was

631
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:55,960
when he knocked on your door and said, "I don't
want to be alone tonight." And one of my favorite

632
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:03,708
pieces of art came out of that, of "You are my
sun." That was so beautiful and encapsulated that

633
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:08,439
moment so perfectly, without having it hot and
heavy or anything else. Just two lonely broken

634
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:10,470
people seeking solace.

635
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,764
MATT: Everyone's like, "Oh, are they going to go
and bang?" I'm like, "No." Not where they are as

636
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:21,938
people. They're both so hurt and feeling so sad
and alone that they need that comfort of somebody

637
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:26,462
else there to hold them. That artwork, I felt, was
a great encapsulation of that.

638
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:31,348
WILL: That's the thing that amazed me about
watching you guys and how into your characters you

639
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:36,365
guys got. The last episode we did, when we're all
in the bar and they're having a drink. We finish

640
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:41,151
the episode, and Liam went, "Man, we needed that."
And it was like, "With everything going on, we

641
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:48,853
"needed to sit at a bar, and we needed to drink. We
needed that." You could tell. Everybody gets into

642
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:50,705
what's going on. It's really cool.

643
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:53,532
MARY: And then we watched Scanlan cause
diarrhea--

644
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:58,026
WILL: And the snarfed quivering palm technique.

645
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:02,120
(laughter)

646
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,395
MATT: I like that. If you guys see any questions,
by the way, that you want to reach out and grab,

647
00:42:06,395 --> 00:42:10,192
feel free to. Or we could look through some of
these papers.

648
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:16,518
RYAN: There's a question for Wendy that someone
sent. By Toruya: What class would she play if she

649
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:18,052
were to join?

650
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:24,321
WENDY: Well, in a game that I'm playing already, I
play a druid, and her name is Clover.

651
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,793
MARISHA: Clover's so cute.

652
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,653
WENDY: She's a faun. That's what I would play.

653
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:33,434
MATT: That's awesome! Clover's awesome.

654
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:44,732
MARISHA: Travis, what is yours and/or Grog's
favorite kill that you've had?

655
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:47,191
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) They're like your children.
You can't really pick one.

656
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:50,657
(laughter)

657
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:53,660
WILL: It's going to be Kashaw in about an hour.

658
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,017
TRAVIS: I think the one where he bit the tongue
out of the mouth and then tore it out. That was

659
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:03,546
pretty good. The gorier the better.

660
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:07,571
MATT: You bask in the glory of those so well.

661
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:09,518
TRAVIS: I do. I get so happy when it's a blood
shower.

662
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:15,196
MATT: This question here: Matt, does anyone in the
game have a deck of many things? No. And if I can

663
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:16,903
help it, they never will.

664
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:19,936
WILL: Write down where we can find that!

665
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:21,671
MARY: Deck of many things.

666
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:24,558
MATT: Oh, good luck, guys. Deck of many things is
what you throw in the game when you're bored and

667
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:26,181
want to get it over with.

668
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:28,204
TRAVIS: That was the charity game, right?

669
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,185
MATT: Yeah.

670
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:34,366
MARISHA: I have someone here saying, how detailed
are our notes? She just says, how detailed are

671
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:39,545
your notes? I don't know if she's asking Matt or
us. Why don't you go first?

672
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:47,276
MATT: My preparation is pretty-- a lot of my notes
are narrative points and bullet points. I'll

673
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:52,578
choose whatever locations they might possibly go
to, I'll list what NPCs are there and what their

674
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:58,826
current circumstance is. I will then bullet-point
important bits of information that NPC might know,

675
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:02,759
based on certain topics that are relevant to the
current storyline, and have that there for quick

676
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:11,877
reference. A lot of it's shorthand, to remind me.
A lot of it looks like a broken-down report that

677
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:15,723
you would send to some company somewhere. It's a
structure of information for myself. It's very

678
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:20,089
loose, because I don't want to feel like I'm
reading a page too often. There are certain scenes

679
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:24,318
I want to set properly, and I'll write those in
advance and go back and forth, but for the most

680
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:31,012
part, I'll outline basic notes and points the NPCs
would know, and then based on what you guys do--

681
00:44:31,012 --> 00:44:34,180
WILL: Do you ever do specific dialogue? Like, I
have to put this line in.

682
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,274
MATT: Every now and then, if it's a very key
character moment and the story lends itself and

683
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:42,485
there's a good possibility that someone will ask
about it. There's many things that don't get asked

684
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:48,108
that the NPCs never mention. Maybe that'll come to
light down the line. For more important NPCs or

685
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:52,018
very specific story beats, I will write out lines
of dialogue to make sure that I don't miss any

686
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:57,090
important information and to make sure that I
don't end up leading the players astray

687
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,531
accidentally, because when you're improvising off
the cuff, sometimes stuff comes out and you're

688
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:03,749
like, "Oh shit. What'd I just say?"

689
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:08,618
MARY: Accents and everything else, I was just
thinking, the notes you have to keep for making

690
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:10,917
sure you get the right voice.

691
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:16,405
MATT: That's the other thing, too. Whenever I
create an NPC, I'll note a texture and timbre of

692
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:25,026
their voice. I'll put "gravelly, low-key, haughty
and full of himself, Cornwall." Make note of the

693
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:32,035
texture and dialect I use, if any. That way, I can
get something ballpark of what they were before.

694
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:34,930
It's not going to be perfect, and I'm sure if you
line them up, you'd be like, "Oh, it's changed

695
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,180
"over time."

696
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,219
TRAVIS: What did you write next to Victor? Crazy?

697
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:39,051
WILL: Mad Hatter.

698
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,942
MATT: Victor, I didn't have to. Victor was created
on the spot.

699
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:42,547
WENDY: Really?

700
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:48,812
MATT: Yeah. And since then, I had to write down,
"fucking crazy old guy." Prospector, I think is

701
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:56,461
where it came from. Very much that (Victor voice)
crazy old prospector type thing. That realm.

702
00:45:56,461 --> 00:46:04,888
MARY: I was going to try to mask of many faces of
Vanessa, and I turned to Travis and was like,

703
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:09,132
"What accent did Vanessa have?" I totally forgot!
I can't sell it if I don't have the accent.

704
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:11,359
TRAVIS: I was like, Spanish?

705
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,897
MATT: She's eastern European.

706
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:20,636
RYAN: This question has come up several times, so
I figure it should be asked. It's by Villager26,

707
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:28,126
Valkyr Parable, and Gaica. Has there been a
storyline that hasn't been or cannot be explored

708
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:33,444
now that the campaign's on stream? If so, can you
tell us about it? Also, was there a failed version

709
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:38,500
of the campaign before Vox Machina, with the same
group. Like, you guys tried it, you had different

710
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,077
characters that didn't work and you had to reboot
it.

711
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:42,499
MARISHA: TPK'd?

712
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:48,421
MATT: No, actually. This group, Vox Machina was
its first time coming together in this world I

713
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:55,318
created. It's been created over time with the
campaign. I didn't go out to build the setting to

714
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,968
build the whole world. It was a one-shot, and I
built a town. I built Stillben. Then as we turned

715
00:46:59,968 --> 00:47:04,753
from a one-shot into a campaign, I began
expanding, and now it's become much bigger than I

716
00:47:04,753 --> 00:47:11,009
anticipated, and I'm perpetually fleshing it out
over time. But yeah, there was no failed earlier

717
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,603
attempt per se.

718
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:15,285
MARY: Didn't Taliesin have a different character
and he rerolled?

719
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:16,555
TRAVIS: Very first game, right?

720
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:20,681
MATT: Very first game, he had a character, and he
couldn't make it for the next few games. It was a

721
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:23,768
dragonborn paladin, and then he couldn't make the
next few games, and when he was able to, his

722
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:27,517
schedule opened up for the next one, I was like,
"Do you want to play the same character?" He was

723
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:30,887
like, "I want to try something different." And
then Percy was born. That was where you guys found

724
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:32,614
him over in the Umber Hills.

725
00:47:32,614 --> 00:47:35,440
TRAVIS: Which is great, because when he was
playing that dragonborn wizard, sorcerer?

726
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,651
MATT: Paladin.

727
00:47:36,651 --> 00:47:42,936
TRAVIS: Paladin. He knew everything. He saved us
from dying in that first hour and a half. We were

728
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:48,588
fumbling around like a bunch of blind morons, and
you could see him biding his time. I wish we had

729
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:51,645
video of it so I could go back and see if you gave
him a nod, like "go ahead and save these

730
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:55,956
"jackasses." He was like, "I would like to freeze
this gear and move this and shift that," and

731
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,684
everything stopped, and we're like, "We're alive!"
Just because of Taliesin.

732
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:08,565
MATT: Yeah. I will say, there aren't any dead
story threads from pre-stream. It's hard to equate

733
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:11,906
what that would be; the party went where they
went. There are many different facets of the world

734
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:13,337
that they didn't come across.

735
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:18,191
MARISHA: It's like trying to argue past timelines
that never existed.

736
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:22,073
MATT: I'm sure there are things that might answer
your question that I can't recall.

737
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:25,850
MARISHA: I'm sure I have a bunch of unborn
children that will never happen.

738
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,054
MATT: That got weird.

739
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:28,635
MARISHA: I don't know why I said it.

740
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:29,891
WILL: I just kissed her, dude!

741
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:34,407
MARY: That's a powerful kiss, man.

742
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:41,017
WILL: Just grab my medal, hey. That's what all the
slices on the arm are. No.

743
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:51,340
MATT: This is an interesting question. From
Sanderf90 on Reddit. Which NPC that Vox Machina

744
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,646
encountered became a lot more important than you
first expected? We know Clarota wasn't supposed to

745
00:48:55,646 --> 00:48:59,010
join the party and Victor came out of thin air.
Are there any examples where a character you

746
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,353
didn't expect became far more important? Gilmore.

747
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:02,634
MARY: Gilmore, yeah.

748
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:13,651
MATT: Your Gilmore was phenomenal. Ryan's Gilmore
was awesome. He was a merchant in Emon that I had

749
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:18,081
created that had a fun personality, and I fleshed
out his background a little bit, and I thought it

750
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:22,110
would be a fun character that they would
occasionally come across, but after that first

751
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:27,892
encounter, it turned into a full discussion, he
and Vax began to build this relationship, and you

752
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:32,833
guys kept going back to him as your go-to purveyor
of magical goods in Emon. Then the investment

753
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:37,924
became more attached, and then as it progressed,
he became a central NPC, which I'm really happy

754
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:39,490
about. I love Gilmore. He's such a great
character.

755
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,288
MARY: I can't wait to see where he goes, to be
honest. I'm really looking forward to seeing it.

756
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:48,987
I'm as big a fan as you guys are of the show, and
it's not just because you guys are my friends. I'm

757
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:54,877
invested in these characters. It's such great,
compelling storytelling. It really is. Bravo to

758
00:49:54,877 --> 00:49:59,002
all of you guys. Plus, it's really fun, but you
also get invested in these great characters. It

759
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:04,672
was hard last week to not hear about certain
characters and go, "Oh my-- oh. I don't know

760
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:05,844
"them."

761
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:08,192
(laughter)

762
00:50:08,192 --> 00:50:15,359
MARISHA: Going off that, Maelyn in the chat asked
if there was any more background for Gilmore.

763
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:22,718
MATT: Yeah. There's plenty of background for
Gilmore. Since he became a central character, I've

764
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:26,381
fully fleshed out his backstory. We'll have to see
if it comes to light.

765
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:31,851
MARISHA: And going off that again, StormShadow17
in chat asked, Are we more attached to these

766
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:35,276
characters because we made them from scratch and
they didn't come from a script?

767
00:50:35,276 --> 00:50:36,941
MATT and MARISHA: Very.

768
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:38,720
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally.

769
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,608
MATT: There is something to be said about-- as
actors, you're handed roles, and you work as a

770
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:47,522
collaboration with a production team to tell a
story, and all of you craft it together. You're a

771
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:54,659
facet of the machine. There's something about
creating from scratch a character's personality,

772
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:59,541
strengths, weaknesses, and then stepping into
their shoes and developing them and seeing

773
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:08,441
whatever their potential is for good or evil and
seeing it through in that imagination-based body

774
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:16,973
of theirs that is so much more personal and
connected that any role I've played. A lot of NPCs

775
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,977
in this game are closer to me than any character
I've played in a video game.

776
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:25,274
WILL: I also think you get the benefit of time
here, which you don't with a lot of roles you

777
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:29,904
play. A lot of roles we do, it's like, "Oh, when
did you play that role?" It was two Tuesdays ago

778
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:34,801
for three hours; that's when I played that role.
Whereas this, you're building it out, and you

779
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:42,573
become your character. It's the difference of when
you start a show, they're writing for you, and

780
00:51:42,573 --> 00:51:45,599
when you really get to know the character, then
they're writing to you. You know what I mean? So

781
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,825
you guys have that awesome benefit of time, so you
<i>really</i> become your characters. We have recording

782
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:57,956
sessions, and even long-running shows, you might
record once a week for three hours for four

783
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:00,814
months, and that's it, and then you're on to the
next character.

784
00:52:00,814 --> 00:52:05,184
MARY: Yeah, but somebody else is making your
choices for you. In this, you make your own

785
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:09,448
choices. You make your own mistakes, you've got
your own success, and everything else, so it is

786
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:12,160
from you guys and what the character is learning.

787
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,137
WILL: When you came to me and were like, "Would
you like to come on the show?" It was like, yeah,

788
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:21,084
great. And you're like, "All right. Who do you
want to be?" What? "Here you go. Who do you want

789
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:25,751
"to be? Let's build it." You sat at my house. I'd
assumed Matt's going to come over for a

790
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,465
half-hour.

791
00:52:27,465 --> 00:52:29,288
MARISHA: Well, my prom in eighth grade--

792
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:31,119
TRAVIS: It's all therapeutic.

793
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,642
WILL: I thought he was coming over for a
half-hour. We were working for five hours. "All

794
00:52:35,642 --> 00:52:38,927
"right, roll." Dude, this is the greatest. It was
awesome.

795
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:42,370
MATT: Which plays into a great question someone
else asked in the chat room. I can't remember who

796
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,036
it was, unfortunately, but they asked: For Will
and Mary, how did you guys come up with your

797
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,342
character backstories?

798
00:52:46,342 --> 00:52:52,867
MARY: Oh. I'm obsessed with the moon and astral
geography and everything else, so I knew I wanted

799
00:52:52,867 --> 00:53:00,404
that to have a very important part in her story,
and then to be honest, I had never played Dungeons

800
00:53:00,404 --> 00:53:05,315
& Dragons, so I looked at the group, and I was
like, what does everybody have? We've got a

801
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:12,149
sorcerer, we've got a druid, we've got gnomes,
we've got bards. I went on the internet and was

802
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:18,748
like, what's-- oh, a tiefling. Oh, a warlock. That
still is a spellcaster; I knew I wanted to cast

803
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:24,759
spells, and I thought, a tiefling. That's not on
the show. Let's do that, it's really cool. Looked

804
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:30,148
at the design and everything else, and then make
it as tragic as possible, because that's always

805
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:36,873
good. Everybody's got a terrible childhood. And we
do, but I love the image of her first time being

806
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:43,210
outside was at night after this castle, and
looking up at the moon and having it sing to her

807
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:49,228
and save her life. That's the moment when she came
to life the first time ever is that moment. And

808
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,705
then she throws rocks at it. No, I'm kidding.

809
00:53:52,705 --> 00:54:01,960
WILL: Yeah, I don't know. The name Kashaw was one
of the main characters in a story I wrote when I

810
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,949
was 16. He was the bad guy. He was the bad
brother, so originally I was sitting there going,

811
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:10,950
"I guess Kashaw could work." And then it changed
the whole character, then you and I sat down and

812
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:16,592
talked, and once you and I talked for a while, as
a writer, I then went, "Here we go." We've talked

813
00:54:16,592 --> 00:54:21,003
about this, since Laura's the same way. I love
fantasy so much that once you get one little

814
00:54:21,003 --> 00:54:26,052
nugget of an idea, then you start building a
world, and the story goes from there, and what

815
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:29,648
happens if we go this way or that way. And then
it's the little things. Different-colored eyes

816
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:33,705
having a whole story and the scars all have a
story, and you can build from every little thing

817
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:35,223
you do.

818
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:37,811
TRAVIS: It's like the ultimate character
customization screen at the beginning of a video

819
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:39,544
game. It's unlimited.

820
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:46,316
WILL: Side, quick thing. You guys do a lot of
video games. Isn't it the greatest when you're the

821
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:50,988
voice of the you character, so you can make it
look like you and it's your voice? It's the

822
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,282
coolest thing ever. I'm the only one in the world
that can do this!

823
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:56,392
(laughter)

824
00:54:56,392 --> 00:55:00,491
MATT: It's really cool until your character dies a
horrible death, and you're like, "I'm going to

825
00:55:00,491 --> 00:55:02,197
"take a walk."

826
00:55:02,197 --> 00:55:04,087
WILL: It's so funny. I love that, though.

827
00:55:04,087 --> 00:55:06,991
TRAVIS: Your own death.

828
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:14,645
MATT: On the topic of backstories and tragic
backstories, I will say, there is no more

829
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:22,570
dangerous occupation in any fantasy world than
being a parent, because everyone's an orphan.

830
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,229
(laughter)

831
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:29,284
MATT: If you have a kid, you're counting your days
down until a demon or orc comes and kills you and

832
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,765
burns your village.

833
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:36,295
WILL: Yeah, I guess it's rare. I created this
character. His life's great. Parents have been

834
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:38,676
married for 75 years. This is great, man.

835
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:40,862
MARY: They're funding my quest.

836
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:44,262
WILL: Yeah, taking a year off from college.

837
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:45,957
MARISHA: It's my bar mitzvah money.

838
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:50,371
TRAVIS: We do need to have one guest that's got
the silver spoon and has never suffered tragedy in

839
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:53,627
his life. We need a super optimistic person.

840
00:55:53,627 --> 00:55:58,277
WILL: Everything will be fine! Come on! We can
befriend the dragon.

841
00:55:58,277 --> 00:56:05,394
WENDY: Almost Clover, but not quite. Almost. Does
have the tragic backstory.

842
00:56:05,394 --> 00:56:08,278
MARY: Parents still alive?

843
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:09,420
WENDY: Everyone's dead.

844
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,377
TRAVIS: Everyone's dead!

845
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:14,612
MATT: Just me and the DM. No NPCs.

846
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:23,124
MARISHA: A friend of mine, Eric Campbell, who's
been on the stream a few times, in his current D&D

847
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:34,045
campaign that he's playing, he's playing a guard
from Whitestone-- in our world-- who saw Vox

848
00:56:34,045 --> 00:56:41,441
Machina come in, do these heroic feats, and is
like, I want to be like those guys. But he's got

849
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:48,357
parents, a nice background. He's going to hit the
road because Vox Machina inspired him, and then

850
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:56,708
find out how fucking terrible and awful it is.
He's real excited to be broken and beaten. He's

851
00:56:56,708 --> 00:57:01,336
trying to be optimistic and a hero--

852
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:03,229
MARY: I got a care package from Mom and Dad!

853
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:05,706
WILL: It's their heads! Oh my god!

854
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:07,115
TRAVIS: What's in the box?

855
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:09,513
ALL: What's in the box?

856
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:16,430
MATT: I saw a question in chat. Someone asked if
the loss of the magic carpet was intentional, and

857
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:23,885
making it difficult to enchant. It was not
intentional. It was a particular danger in the

858
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:27,831
room to any of the players. It was unfortunate
that rolls--

859
00:57:27,831 --> 00:57:30,064
MARISHA: The carpet took the brunt.

860
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:32,203
WILL: You saved me, though. Thank you.

861
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:33,915
MATT: The carpet took the brunt of it.

862
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:39,933
MARISHA: That's right! I feel really bad for you
guys, because Liam and I were like, "No!" And

863
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:43,329
you're like, "What the fuck is wrong with these
people?"

864
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,516
TRAVIS: We were in the other room. We were outside
in the studio.

865
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:50,163
WILL: There's the delay, so 30 seconds after it
happened, you heard from the other side of the

866
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:52,239
room, "No!"

867
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,958
MARISHA: You could feel the pain twice, like it
happened twice.

868
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:59,853
TRAVIS: You did it on purpose.

869
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:01,541
MATT: No, I did not do it on purpose!

870
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,491
TRAVIS: I'd like to roll insight. It's all good.

871
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:05,181
MARY: He's telling the truth.

872
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:10,256
MATT: It made it so much easier for you guys to
get from place to place when you had that magic

873
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:12,112
carpet.

874
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,111
TRAVIS: We flew over the Underdark. We flew over
the whole encampment and stuff.

875
00:58:14,111 --> 00:58:16,201
MATT: It was cool. It had a lot of utility.

876
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,931
TRAVIS: Now we're going to die quicker.

877
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:28,617
MATT: These things happen. Let's see. For the
cast, what predictions about where the story was

878
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:31,746
going did you make that turned out to be
completely wrong? Or did you have any theories

879
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:33,810
that turned out to be spot-on?

880
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,725
TRAVIS: Clarota was a bitch!

881
00:58:35,725 --> 00:58:38,394
MARY: You never trusted him from the beginning.

882
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:42,346
TRAVIS: I said it, but half the party was all
about it. I wrote it four times.

883
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:50,533
MARY: I remember when you guys went down into that
cave, and I was like, this is totally random, and

884
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:56,908
everybody said, "Don't do it!" And down you went.
I thought, "How much of this was planned? Was

885
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,770
"there somebody there in the first place?"

886
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:03,667
MATT: There was. I didn't expect them to ever
encounter it for the next four or five sessions,

887
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:10,968
let alone have it go so positively. It was going
to be an encounter, but they managed to roll

888
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:15,320
socially in a way that convinced Clarota not that
they were friends, necessarily, but to the

889
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:20,245
betterment of his survival to infiltrate and
manipulate.

890
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:27,211
TRAVIS: I thought the Briarwoods were both
vampires and somebody was going to turn vampiric.

891
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:32,902
I'm not going to say it was an easy fight, but I
thought somebody was going to be on death's door

892
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,188
legit, not just because of the ziggurat's
anti-magic zone.

893
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:37,970
MARY: Laura was.

894
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,288
TRAVIS: That was after-- was that because of the
fight, or was it because of the ziggurat?

895
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:44,265
MARY: No, Vex was before you guys went to
Whitestone. Wasn't it?

896
00:59:44,265 --> 00:59:47,778
TRAVIS: Going down to one? That was down in the
ziggurat.

897
00:59:47,778 --> 00:59:52,134
MARY: No, it was outside the castle. She cast
Finger of Death.

898
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:54,139
MATT: She's done it twice.

899
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:59,700
MARY: She's done it twice. Before you guys got the
carriage driver. I think this is right. Finger of

900
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:04,106
Death and Laura was two points away from dead.

901
01:00:04,106 --> 01:00:14,696
WILL: You're already up. Your fun is wrong. Your
fun is wrong! (laughs) I want one of those. I call

902
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:15,928
that.

903
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:18,485
MARISHA: Do you want to answer that question?

904
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:24,659
MATT: This is a good question, because this comes
up often. Will Cooper, @willmortis asks,

905
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:28,907
@matthewmercer, how open are you to ideas and
suggestions from us about allies for Vox Machina

906
01:00:28,907 --> 01:00:36,780
to encounter? I'm careful, because it is my game
world. I have a very specific layout as to how the

907
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:46,891
things in the story ought to go. If I do intend to
possibly in the future put this content out for

908
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:50,884
you guys to utilize, I have to be careful with
copyright stuff and not using too many outside

909
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:55,712
ideas because then it gets a little tricky. Plus,
a lot of people that have submitted stuff have

910
01:00:55,712 --> 01:01:00,090
been like, "Hey, I have an item I'd like for
someone to use. It does plus six damage and gives

911
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,043
"them the strength of four gods." Okay. That's
cool, yo.

912
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:05,260
TRAVIS: What's wrong with that? Give me that
thing.

913
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,982
MARY: You have it. It's called Bacon.

914
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:14,876
MATT: Or I'll get NPCs that have a 14-page
backstory that is fun to read, but the focus is on

915
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:19,626
the players. I'll try to bring in what I can. So
instead, we've done a couple of circumstances

916
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:22,422
where we've incorporated NPCs that fans have
submitted as part of a contest, and we'll start

917
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:27,424
hopefully doing that more as the year progresses.
There will be opportunities for that, and you're

918
01:01:27,424 --> 01:01:30,946
more than welcome to send stuff in. I don't have
time to read everything, unfortunately; my free

919
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:39,950
time is gone forever now, and I accept that, but
we'll have contests and stuff and incorporate

920
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:47,715
stuff for fans. We've had fans that we've lost due
to illness or circumstances in the past that I've

921
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:51,757
incorporated into the game. We've had fans who
were sick, and we've brought into the game as

922
01:01:51,757 --> 01:01:54,833
NPCs, as well, and we've had contests in the past
and hopefully do more of those in the future.

923
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:59,928
As far as how open to it? I'm careful, because it
is still my game, and I don't want it to be too

924
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:03,728
much of a door I open, where everyone throws
everything and I no longer have control over it,

925
01:02:03,728 --> 01:02:07,846
and I have very specific balancing ideas, too. But
there will be opportunities.

926
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:14,377
WILL: You're right, though. It's one of the
reasons why legally, your favorite television

927
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:18,405
show, you can't go and write a script for it. They
can't read it, because then if it shows up later,

928
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:23,076
then they can say, "Hey, I wrote that." It's one
of those things that it's a cool idea, but you do

929
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:26,297
have to be careful when you're building your own
world that it's just yours.

930
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:29,171
MATT: Yeah, if I ever intend to try and release
anything in the future, like a campaign setting,

931
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:33,526
which I would love to. The question comes up
often. I have to be very careful about that.

932
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:36,216
That's the largest reason.

933
01:02:36,216 --> 01:02:42,585
WILL: He's not being uncool. He's being totally
prudent. You have to, though. It's important.

934
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:44,455
MATT: There will be opportunities in the future.

935
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:53,425
MARISHA: And a lot of the players get that, too,
and we're on the same path. What, do you not get

936
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:54,949
that, Travis?

937
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:58,016
TRAVIS: Laura texted me and said my pulled-up
pants look weird like that.

938
01:02:58,016 --> 01:03:02,898
MARY and WILL: Wow.

939
01:03:02,898 --> 01:03:05,619
TRAVIS: It's hot in here! I was pulling the pants
up.

940
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:06,968
MARY: I thought we were waist-up!

941
01:03:06,968 --> 01:03:11,546
WILL: I'm sorry. I'm also about to get married, so
the idea of live-stream nagging is amazing to me.

942
01:03:11,546 --> 01:03:13,802
Wow.

943
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:15,859
MATT: (shushes, whip crack)

944
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:21,540
TRAVIS: You don't know what it's like living with
a dragon.

945
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,679
WILL: Could you make a masculinity throwing save?

946
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,743
MATT: That's an eight.

947
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,760
TRAVIS: Advantage? Two!

948
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:43,327
WILL: That's awesome. I love that. She's
hysterically funny. "Your rolled-up pants look

949
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:44,964
"weird."

950
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:51,638
MATT: Preciously Insane on Reddit asks whether
Matt has ever had to discard any cool ideas

951
01:03:51,638 --> 01:03:54,986
because of the players going in an entirely
different direction or because he felt it wouldn't fit

952
01:03:54,986 --> 01:03:59,573
in the world. Often! But I hold onto them
because that could come into a one-shot in the

953
01:03:59,775 --> 01:04:03,476
future, or if it comes back around in the story,
they return to the same place, they continue that

954
01:04:03,476 --> 01:04:09,288
thread, possibly, and like I said, if I ever end
up wanting to release a setting, it would be a

955
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:13,975
cool thing to put into the world that even if Vox
Machina never encounters, you guys can in your own

956
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:18,758
games. So yeah, I hold onto it all. Not everything
gets caught. It's part of the fun of the

957
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:21,574
randomness of the game is you never know where the
players are going to go. I'll put a lot of effort

958
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:26,168
into maps and threads, and be like, "All right,
cool, so today, they're-- where are you going?"

959
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:32,225
TRAVIS: I loved it in the pre-stream games, you'd
show up with these two bags and five or six maps,

960
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:36,873
and I remember there was one night, a six- or
seven-hour game, where no maps were put upon the

961
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:41,230
table. You were rolling them back up, and I was
like, "Were those for tonight?" You were like,

962
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:46,734
"They were going to be." And we didn't go any of
those places.

963
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:49,878
MATT: It still happens here, often. But that's
fine.

964
01:04:49,878 --> 01:04:55,531
MARISHA: My favorite was still when we snuck in
the back door of the Clasp the first time, and we

965
01:04:55,531 --> 01:05:04,181
were like "Knock-knock. Oh, hey, Clasp leader.
Hey. What's up? We're here to decapitate you." And

966
01:05:04,181 --> 01:05:13,075
we didn't plan any of that and you're like, "Oh,
you walk in? Let me start drawing real quick." And

967
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:19,484
starts drawing things. He's like, "Clasp leader is
there." It was good.

968
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:21,683
TRAVIS: Off the cuff.

969
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:29,457
MARISHA: Oh no, it just went dark. It's another
one going off that. Ivar @mistbornelite asks, how

970
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:34,592
often do we strategize outside the game? Which is
never, really.

971
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:36,770
TRAVIS: Strategize?

972
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:42,607
MARY: But do you think about it during the week? I
remember going, "Well, we ended that, and we've

973
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:44,881
"got frost giants coming up. What can I do?"

974
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:47,123
MARISHA: It's impossible not to think about it.

975
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:52,422
TRAVIS: I really wanted to look to see what their
traits are and stuff, but I can't.

976
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:55,205
MARY: I didn't do that. I didn't cheat--

977
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,959
TRAVIS: I wanted to cheat. I'm saying I wanted to
cheat.

978
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:03,474
MARY: I was like, "I really want to find out about
white dragons." But no, I did think about what

979
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:05,354
could I do?

980
01:06:05,354 --> 01:06:13,047
MARISHA: I'll do that. Honestly, I think more
often than not, I'll be like, "Goddamn it, Percy

981
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:17,468
"totally had the last word. I should have said
this."

982
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:19,400
WILL: Oh, you're doing the drive away from the
fight!

983
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,649
MARISHA: I should have done <i>this</i>.

984
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:25,496
WILL: The Jerk store called, and they ran out of
you!

985
01:06:25,496 --> 01:06:27,870
MARISHA: And I'll be like, next time!

986
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:40,075
MATT: To be fair, Taliesin is the master of the
one-liner bookend. He throws out some of the

987
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:45,019
best-- he'll wait for the perfect moment, and
then, "I'm sorry." (boof)

988
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:51,006
WILL: But there's a genius to that. Being able to
button a scene. There is a genius to that.

989
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:56,341
MARISHA: But I'll spend the week being like, "Next
time I see Percy, I'm going to give him a piece of

990
01:06:56,341 --> 01:06:59,010
"my--" And it never happens.

991
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:04,439
MATT: What you guys were saying about the creature
stuff, don't forget, in-game, you can research

992
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:09,427
creatures that you know you may encounter out in
the world to learn about what they do, and you

993
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:14,945
can, depending on how well you research and retain
the information, learn things like weaknesses or

994
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:16,695
what type of abilities they have.

995
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:20,001
TRAVIS: Me, research? He ain't going to read.

996
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,227
MATT: You have a problem with that.

997
01:07:22,227 --> 01:07:23,492
TRAVIS: But if it has pictures.

998
01:07:23,492 --> 01:07:28,061
WILL: I asked you about that, because you were
bringing me back, and I said, "Look, I haven't

999
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:30,981
"been able to watch the show lately. What should I
know?" And you were the first person to go, "You

1000
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:34,964
"know what? You're in a whole different part of the
world. You shouldn't know anything going on. So

1001
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:39,458
"come in the way you came in before. They're coming
to you, so you shouldn't know what was happening."

1002
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:44,055
I was like, "Okay. Yeah, that makes more sense." I
wanted to research and you were like, "No. You

1003
01:07:44,055 --> 01:07:45,479
"don't need to."

1004
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,760
MATT: For instance, in the game, Laura has a very
strong knowledge of dragons; that's been her

1005
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:56,199
favored enemy for a long time. You guys could
spend time and really delve into what threats they

1006
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,800
pose beyond your encounters, and who knows what
you might find.

1007
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,717
MARY: Exactly. Working for the Slayer's Take, how
much time have we had in the library after

1008
01:08:03,717 --> 01:08:12,486
encountering a rakshasa or the dragon. How much
time have we had to do our rakshasa--

1009
01:08:12,486 --> 01:08:15,670
WILL: You and I talked about a bunch of that stuff
coming back in, where we all met up, and we were

1010
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,248
there 20 minutes before Matt got there.

1011
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:20,661
MARY and WILL: What have we been doing?

1012
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:25,042
WILL: What was the last mission we were on? We
came up with a backstory for each other, for our

1013
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:26,480
relationship.

1014
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,860
MARY: Why we're together.

1015
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:32,791
WILL: Why we're friends, and why we've hung on,
and all that kind of stuff. <i>Friends</i>, all the

1016
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:38,836
people on the internet. Just friends. But yeah, I
love that stuff.

1017
01:08:38,836 --> 01:08:42,638
MATT: Any other questions burning right now?

1018
01:08:42,638 --> 01:08:51,816
MARISHA: Travis, do you think Grog is unable to be
corrupted by Craven Edge due to his lower

1019
01:08:51,816 --> 01:08:57,482
intelligence? You're too dumb to be corrupted?

1020
01:08:57,482 --> 01:09:03,235
TRAVIS: I don't even think Grog thinks the sword's
trying to corrupt him. He's just a chatty sword

1021
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:12,423
that for some reason talks to him. That's it. He
got the battle-sound lightsaber at Target, and it

1022
01:09:12,423 --> 01:09:14,080
talks.

1023
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:23,031
MARISHA: Is Grog convinced that it's in his head,
and it's like Wilson and Tom Hanks in Castaway?

1024
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:30,773
TRAVIS: I think he thinks it's just loud enough
for him to hear, so he's always like-- I have no

1025
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:32,868
idea how that sound actually works.

1026
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:37,994
MATT: I wasn't expecting you guys to retrieve
Craven Edge from the corpse. I wasn't expecting it

1027
01:09:37,994 --> 01:09:42,810
to be kept, and I definitely wasn't expecting it
to be handed to you, and now I'm so excited to see

1028
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,375
where this goes.

1029
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,784
TRAVIS: You didn't think we'd keep it?

1030
01:09:46,784 --> 01:09:52,152
MARISHA: He told me later he thought we'd throw it
into the acid with everything else.

1031
01:09:52,152 --> 01:09:54,396
TRAVIS: Fuck that noise. I'd throw Percy in if he
tried to do that.

1032
01:09:54,396 --> 01:10:02,317
MARY: I'm still waiting for the Calvin & Hobbes
mashups of Grog and Craven Edge. I put that out

1033
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:03,751
there.

1034
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:09,574
TRAVIS: I wasn't equipped for that shit in the
monk pit. That was unexpected. I had trouble

1035
01:10:09,574 --> 01:10:11,045
putting baby down.

1036
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:15,835
MARY: Baby didn't want to be put down. You're not
picking up a flaming hammer instead of baby.

1037
01:10:15,835 --> 01:10:23,763
MATT: Interesting question from duetempte in
reddit says, how do you balance combat around six

1038
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:32,295
to eight PCs, especially one- or two-enemy boss
fights? Best fast answer as I can. When you have

1039
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:36,935
that many players, you have to keep running
quickly. Taking initiative is a huge thing. For

1040
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:44,168
initiative, when I ask from top to bottom in
chunks of five. 25 to 20? 20 to 15? And what I do

1041
01:10:44,168 --> 01:10:49,640
is write the players' names down in the order, and
then if an enemy falls into that order, I'll write

1042
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:56,181
it in the column to the right of it, staggered. It
almost looks like a back-and-forth line so I can

1043
01:10:56,181 --> 01:11:00,056
tell one column are heroes, one column are
enemies, and I have them in the order that they

1044
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:04,627
show up in initiative. That way it's very easy,
very quick to write down, and visually it's easy

1045
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:09,622
for me to reference who's up next. But for
balancing? You don't always want to give something

1046
01:11:09,622 --> 01:11:13,283
more hit points, because that means it's going to
take longer. With a lot of players, you still want

1047
01:11:13,283 --> 01:11:18,444
it to be around long enough to be a challenge. I
recommend increasing damage it deals, because it

1048
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:21,464
doesn't mean you have to have as long an
encounter, but still have that threat of serious

1049
01:11:21,464 --> 01:11:30,539
danger. Not crazy damage, but scale the damage it
deals. A lot of creatures have legendary

1050
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:33,033
resistance and legendary actions, which are very
helpful.

1051
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:36,710
MARISHA: That's some bullshit. It's such
bullshit.

1052
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,596
TRAVIS: You get three per round or something?

1053
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:43,939
MATT: Oh my god, you're seven players. That's
fair.

1054
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:48,800
MARISHA: It sucks when you're like, I'm going to
burn this 5th-level spell, and it's going to be

1055
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,618
fucking amazing, and it can't fail, because the
spell says-- oh, legendary resistance. Oh.

1056
01:11:54,618 --> 01:12:00,456
MATT: So sorry. Maybe don't start off with all
your powerful shit.

1057
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:03,692
WILL: Wow. You know what would help? The deck of
everything, or whatever the hell that thing is.

1058
01:12:03,692 --> 01:12:05,287
MATT: No.

1059
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:14,736
MARY: Wand of healing. Do you guys ever go home
and have moments of contention about what occurred

1060
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:16,320
in the game?

1061
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,509
WILL: I'm so glad that was the question. I thought
it was going a different way. I'm so glad that was

1062
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:26,597
your question! I've got to be honest with you. I'm
glad that's where you went.

1063
01:12:26,597 --> 01:12:28,426
MARY: Do you ever role-play Gilmore?

1064
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:32,284
WILL: That's what I was waiting for! Do you ever
go home and have moments of contention? I was

1065
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:33,903
like, thank god.

1066
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:40,286
MARISHA: What was that tweet that we got that they
tagged you, me, and Liam in it, and it was like,

1067
01:12:40,286 --> 01:12:47,949
"God, Vax's voice is so sexy. Hey, Marisha, do you
ask Matt to do Vax's voice for you?" I was like--

1068
01:12:47,949 --> 01:12:58,804
out of everything; out of all the fan art, fanfic,
<i>now</i> you done made it weird. That's the line

1069
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,649
right there. We found it.

1070
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:09,205
MARY: But did stuff happen in the game and do you
have to take moments of breathing, or do you

1071
01:13:09,205 --> 01:13:10,876
realize it's just a game?

1072
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:19,583
MARISHA: Only a few times. Getting the polearm in
the face, I was like, really? All three attacks on

1073
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,982
Keyleth?

1074
01:13:20,982 --> 01:13:23,203
MATT: You can barter with an NPC. You can't barter
with the DM.

1075
01:13:23,203 --> 01:13:24,764
MARY: What!

1076
01:13:24,764 --> 01:13:26,448
WILL: (whip crack)

1077
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:29,034
MARY: Did you hear that? I hear that one, too.

1078
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:40,527
MARISHA: So many whips in the atmosphere. Not too
bad, though. Every game, we have people being

1079
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:44,833
like, "Oh shit, Matt's sleeping on the couch
tonight!" And I'm like, no, it's fine.

1080
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:49,256
TRAVIS: That doesn't happen at your house? When I
almost smacked Trinket and he ran through the

1081
01:13:49,256 --> 01:13:50,502
minefield?

1082
01:13:50,502 --> 01:13:52,136
MATT: You deserved that.

1083
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:56,018
TRAVIS: Generally, everybody laughs, and when you
clean it up, you're like, "Man, that was fun."

1084
01:13:56,018 --> 01:14:05,498
She's like, "You never do that again." "Oh shit,
it's just a game." She was like-- and went

1085
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:08,387
upstairs. "Babe, I love you!"

1086
01:14:08,387 --> 01:14:10,264
MARISHA: I love it so much.

1087
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:14,145
TRAVIS: Imaginary bear. "What?" Nothing!

1088
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:16,151
WILL: Totally real.

1089
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:20,457
MARY: Start doing bear sounds downstairs.

1090
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,477
TRAVIS: (bear-like) Grog is okay.

1091
01:14:22,477 --> 01:14:29,533
MATT: A two-part question; I want to answer a
couple of these. PseudoX1 on Reddit writes, with

1092
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:34,029
some enemies that Vox Machina has faced, every
once in awhile, a PC gets one-shot by something.

1093
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:36,967
Do you plan on one-shotting someone when they come
up against these enemies to provide a challenge,

1094
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:38,463
or is it a side effect of the monster?

1095
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,879
All the ones they've come across have been actual
side effects of the monster, like the banshee.

1096
01:14:41,879 --> 01:14:47,491
That's what they do. It's a nice way to bring in
challenge, especially when you have certain

1097
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:50,226
players that are really resilient. Every now and
then, it's nice to remind them that not all

1098
01:14:50,226 --> 01:14:55,778
attacks just do damage. Some of them snuff you
out. It's a cool dynamic to it, because it

1099
01:14:55,778 --> 01:15:00,708
immediately turns the tide of the battle to not
only intense danger, even if it's not a very

1100
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:06,904
powerful creature, to survival as well as being on
the aggressive, which is great. It adds tension to

1101
01:15:06,904 --> 01:15:10,464
it. Other part of the question: when listening to
players monologuing with each other, you look like

1102
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,898
you're staring into their souls. What is usually
going on in your mind during those? I'm

1103
01:15:14,898 --> 01:15:18,638
remembering Nick at Night reruns, usually. Dick
van Dyke Show.

1104
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:21,555
WILL: You've got (sings Meow Mix jingle).

1105
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:27,181
MARY: (flatline sound) A nice 1K tone.

1106
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:30,600
MATT: Someone please edit that, and at one of
those moments when the players are monologuing, my

1107
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,841
brain going off on the Gilligan's Island intro.

1108
01:15:32,841 --> 01:15:37,784
TRAVIS: When you were monologuing, I actually
leaned over to Laura or to you and was like, "He

1109
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:40,680
"hasn't looked down yet," because you were
explaining the history of the world, and we're

1110
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:46,691
always looking for a little bit of-- and come back
up, and you were up here the whole time. I'm like,

1111
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:48,245
"He's a god."

1112
01:15:48,245 --> 01:15:50,740
MARY: It was such an amazing monologue.

1113
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,295
TRAVIS: It was insane! It was six minutes!

1114
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:53,584
WILL: It was the history of the world!

1115
01:15:53,584 --> 01:15:58,627
MATT: I was afraid it was going to be boring. I
didn't realize I was going to be telling you guys

1116
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:01,237
the whole-- and that was the condensed version.

1117
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,843
WILL: I love that, though. Oh, he's talking about
how the world was created.

1118
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:05,888
MARISHA: It's creation myth time.

1119
01:16:05,888 --> 01:16:08,722
MARY: It's like Greek mythology. We've got all of
it up until--

1120
01:16:08,722 --> 01:16:13,111
MATT: You guys never got to the point where you
inquired about the creation myth of Exandria and

1121
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:16,922
what the Second Spark was, the Penance, and all
these other terms you've come across at points in

1122
01:16:16,922 --> 01:16:21,544
the game. It all plays into that world, and that
might be unveiled more as time goes on, as now

1123
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:27,138
you're looking for the Vestiges, which do tie into
previous time periods. But yeah, as soon as you

1124
01:16:27,138 --> 01:16:31,762
guys started inquiring about it, I was like,
okay!

1125
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:34,493
TRAVIS: We do go back and watch those things,
though, because there's no way some of us catch

1126
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:36,809
that the first time around. You're a good
note-taker, but I'm like--

1127
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:46,769
MARISHA: Even so, though, I'm generally scribbling
hot words, because I can't get it all. Oh, that

1128
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,520
seems important. Key points.

1129
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,870
WILL: I scribble them wrong. I was home later that
night going, "What's a vestibule?"

1130
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:57,440
TRAVIS: The vegetables of the portents.

1131
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,882
WILL: We're looking for vegetables. What's going
on?

1132
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:08,817
MARISHA: Someone said, Matt, how hard was it to
decide to destroy the city of Emon after you spent

1133
01:17:08,817 --> 01:17:13,915
so much time to build it? Additionally, how early
in the story planning did you decide to destroy

1134
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:16,597
the city, and what caused you to take that route?

1135
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:22,162
MATT: That's a great question. It was very
difficult. I'd spent a lot of time developing and

1136
01:17:22,162 --> 01:17:28,013
fleshing out this entire city, and I'd set the
stage for it a long time ago. I didn't quite know

1137
01:17:28,013 --> 01:17:32,506
the form it was going to take, I just knew that
the Chroma Conclave, depending on events that

1138
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:38,061
transpired and the return, which was going to
coincide with-- I know I had a two-year window of

1139
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:42,487
Winter's Crest festivals. I was keeping tabs on
that. That was when they were going to be

1140
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:46,410
signifying the release of Thordak from the Fire
Elemental Plane. It just so happened that Emon

1141
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:51,651
became so central to the campaign at that time,
and based on his previous experience being sealed

1142
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:56,425
by the adventuring party that now largely
incorporates themselves with the Council of

1143
01:17:56,425 --> 01:17:58,808
Tal'Dorei, that would be the first place to
strike.

1144
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:02,532
And it's not just Emon. They're hitting a lot of
other targets of major power that have some

1145
01:18:02,532 --> 01:18:08,730
history with members of the Conclave, and it was a
tough decision, but it made sense driving forward

1146
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:14,680
for the story. It brought together a moment where
players themselves, their characters were starting

1147
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:20,427
to wonder what their purpose was. It was a really
great crux moment. Unintentionally! I had this

1148
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:24,620
whole story arc looming, and the characters were
hitting interesting points of having an

1149
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:29,856
existential crisis of what is it that's holding us
together? What is our purpose? And I was like, "Oh

1150
01:18:29,856 --> 01:18:34,921
"my god, this is going to be perfect. This is going
to be perfect! Boom!" And dropped it. It was so

1151
01:18:34,921 --> 01:18:36,037
good.

1152
01:18:36,037 --> 01:18:40,483
MARY: The minute Vax said, "I don't know what
we're doing. Why are we doing this?" All of a

1153
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:47,519
sudden, I was like, "You did not plan that out." I
seemed at that point that you said to Liam, "Just

1154
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:51,378
"plant that, because the bomb's ready to drop."

1155
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:56,913
MATT: That whole conversation, I'm sitting there
going, "Just give me 30 minutes! Just give me 30

1156
01:18:56,913 --> 01:19:01,430
"minutes, man. It's coming!" It was so great. It
was very hard, but as a writer, sometimes to

1157
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:06,839
really elevate the stakes of a story, which is
what you want to do when it continues like that,

1158
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:12,925
you want to elevate the stakes and bring
everything back to a core, central focus and make

1159
01:19:12,925 --> 01:19:17,077
everyone feel the gravity of what's to come, you
have to destroy something that you love, and Emon

1160
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:20,004
happened to be the gem of that time.

1161
01:19:20,004 --> 01:19:24,981
MARY: Plus, they were getting complacent. They're
all on the council, they've got a nice keep. It's

1162
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:26,201
all lovely.

1163
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:31,383
MATT: You've got to mix things up a little. I was
glad to bring that two-year seed to bear. It was

1164
01:19:31,383 --> 01:19:32,665
fun.

1165
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:34,445
MARISHA: That's crazy. Two years.

1166
01:19:34,445 --> 01:19:41,041
MATT: What was your favorite PC that you've played
as?

1167
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,907
MARY: Victor!

1168
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:47,908
MATT: PC, like when I've actually played a game.
Actually, my friend Jason Bender, who's a game

1169
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:52,379
designer, he ran a game years ago where I played a
dwarf fighter, my first time playing a combat

1170
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:56,695
character in a D&D game. I was always casters
before that. I played a dwarf fighter named

1171
01:19:56,695 --> 01:20:02,504
Grimthorne, which I actually incorporated into
Exandria as the dwarf that ran you guys through

1172
01:20:02,504 --> 01:20:10,405
the brawlers' league. That character is my old PC,
Grimthorne. He was a fun, brash character.

1173
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:13,470
TRAVIS: He was our manager, right?

1174
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,387
WENDY: The wheels are turning. Oh yeah, that guy.

1175
01:20:16,387 --> 01:20:20,995
MATT: Yeah, shaved dwarf with no hair on his body,
and most of the dwarves shunned him for that

1176
01:20:20,995 --> 01:20:22,317
purpose.

1177
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,647
TRAVIS: He took us through that tournament,
right?

1178
01:20:23,647 --> 01:20:27,587
MATT: Yeah, he took you through the brawler's
league tournament, yeah, where Scanlan summoned a

1179
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:30,465
pony and you cut it in half to intimidate the
other team, and it worked.

1180
01:20:30,465 --> 01:20:33,496
TRAVIS: I didn't just cut its head off. I smeared
its gore all over us and we started screaming like

1181
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:34,092
crazy people.

1182
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:35,719
MATT and TRAVIS: Like you do.

1183
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:36,810
MARY: Wow.

1184
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:37,934
WILL: Fair enough.

1185
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:42,163
TRAVIS: You know you've done well when Mercer's
eyebrows go up, especially like-- oh.

1186
01:20:42,163 --> 01:20:50,128
MATT: Did Percy's demon get stronger with every
target on the list that he killed? Maybe. Also,

1187
01:20:50,128 --> 01:20:54,386
what would have happened if he killed all five or
six, counting Cassandra? I don't know. I guess

1188
01:20:54,386 --> 01:20:56,073
we'll never find out.

1189
01:20:56,073 --> 01:20:59,788
MARISHA: He does this all the time. I don't even
know anymore.

1190
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,221
MATT: But glad you're paying attention.

1191
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:02,796
TRAVIS: What did you say?

1192
01:21:02,796 --> 01:21:04,103
MATT: Nothing.

1193
01:21:04,103 --> 01:21:06,335
WILL: Why'd you write "kord" on my head?

1194
01:21:06,335 --> 01:21:08,741
(laughter)

1195
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:12,789
TRAVIS: Kord. I mean, krod. (moans)

1196
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:21,813
MATT: Let's see. What are your favorite snacks or
drinks that you like to be gifted at conventions.

1197
01:21:21,813 --> 01:21:23,410
MARY: Apparently, beer!

1198
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:29,199
WILL: Be careful how you answer this. I said
Twizzlers once as a joke, and everywhere I go now,

1199
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,415
I get Twizzlers.

1200
01:21:30,415 --> 01:21:35,682
TRAVIS: I get bags and bags of Reese's Pieces, and
I like them. I don't drink them.

1201
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:42,986
MARISHA: I would say, good note, though: please
don't bring us weapons at cons. Don't gift us

1202
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:43,735
weapons.

1203
01:21:43,735 --> 01:21:45,029
WILL: Important safety tip.

1204
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:46,078
TRAVIS: We've got to fly with them.

1205
01:21:46,078 --> 01:21:48,371
MARISHA: We've got to fly, and we have a hard time
getting them home.

1206
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:49,770
WILL: Bet TSA likes that.

1207
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:56,528
MATT: Yeah, we had a few great weapons gifted to
us at this recent convention, which were wonderful

1208
01:21:56,528 --> 01:22:01,594
gifts, and thank you guys for those, and we had to
go through Wizard World and find a way to ship

1209
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:04,617
them back to us for that purpose, and it was a
whole--

1210
01:22:04,617 --> 01:22:06,500
WILL: (blade scraping) Yeah, I'm in seat 1A.

1211
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,570
(laughter)

1212
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:11,128
MARY: Sir, your warhammer is flaming. Could you
put it out?

1213
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:13,894
MARISHA: There's no smoking on the aircraft.

1214
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:19,864
MATT: Somebody at the con gave Taliesin a
Pepperbox replica, with an actual spinning barrel.

1215
01:22:19,864 --> 01:22:24,633
A very small one, but a Pepperbox replica. He was
like, "This is really beautiful. Oh god. I'm not

1216
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:29,526
"checking luggage." So he took it in two pieces and
put them separately in there in the hopes it

1217
01:22:29,526 --> 01:22:32,452
wouldn't be a problem. Sure enough, TSA stopped
him from going through. He had to fill out all

1218
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:36,549
this paperwork. Spent 30 minutes. This is the same
TSA where the guy recognized me and Sam, so I walk

1219
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:42,736
over to check up on him, and the guy goes over and
goes, "Oh, of course it'd be Percy." And he helped

1220
01:22:42,736 --> 01:22:47,052
actually explain to TSA what it was and that he's
not trying to hide a gun through. We actually had

1221
01:22:47,052 --> 01:22:51,515
a Critter as part of TSA that was helping Taliesin
not get arrested for trying to carry a

1222
01:22:51,515 --> 01:22:54,051
150-year-old firearm.

1223
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:56,521
WILL: Do you mind proving you're Percy? Roll a
d20.

1224
01:22:56,521 --> 01:23:00,388
TRAVIS: They take you into the mirrored room, and
it's like--

1225
01:23:00,388 --> 01:23:02,962
(laughter)

1226
01:23:02,962 --> 01:23:04,842
TRAVIS: Am I going to jail or walking out?

1227
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:06,219
MARY: That's right!

1228
01:23:06,219 --> 01:23:10,740
MATT: I will happily run an improvised one-shot to
not go to prison.

1229
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:15,232
TRAVIS: I saw there was a person that was asking
about, do we have too many magical items? I think

1230
01:23:15,232 --> 01:23:17,550
it's important to say that you told us that we can
only have three.

1231
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,445
MATT: Three attuned.

1232
01:23:19,445 --> 01:23:22,523
TRAVIS: Attuned to us, yeah, so we don't walk
around and be like, "Oh, I'm going to use this."

1233
01:23:22,523 --> 01:23:26,299
MATT: You guys have been collecting magical items
for over three years now. That's the thing. They

1234
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:30,653
have a number of them, and a lot of them are
circumstantially helpful. I try not to give out

1235
01:23:30,653 --> 01:23:42,628
too many. You only really get one major upgrade
every six months or so, or somewhere in that

1236
01:23:42,628 --> 01:23:46,606
neighborhood. I try to make it more special so
when you do find one, it's a cool thing. If you

1237
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:50,307
give out too many too quickly, few have the
impact, and it's not really awesome when you find

1238
01:23:50,307 --> 01:23:51,842
something new.

1239
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:56,247
WILL: You guys tend to have a lot of stuff. I
remember the last game, Laura's like, "No, 750

1240
01:23:56,247 --> 01:24:00,124
"knick-knacks," and we're all like, "Oh, okay.
Knick-knacks." And she's like, "No, it's written

1241
01:24:00,124 --> 01:24:07,053
"here. He told me I had 750 knick-knacks." Tons of
stuff.

1242
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:10,729
MARY: Who's got the skull? Where's the skull?

1243
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:14,692
TRAVIS: Oh, I found out where it was, because Vex
is a sneaky bastard.

1244
01:24:14,692 --> 01:24:16,796
MATT: Vex was the last person to have it.

1245
01:24:16,796 --> 01:24:18,483
MARY: Vex was the last person to have it, okay.

1246
01:24:18,483 --> 01:24:19,880
MARISHA: She hid it, I'm pretty sure.

1247
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,506
TRAVIS: She didn't hide it. I rewatched the
episode.

1248
01:24:23,506 --> 01:24:26,773
(laughter)

1249
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:32,607
TRAVIS: I missed it the first time! I miss a lot
of things the first time. I missed Percy doing the

1250
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:33,845
shadow thing.

1251
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:36,887
MATT: That was so beautiful. That worked out
perfectly.

1252
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:41,374
MARY: Do you know what math is?

1253
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:46,982
MATT: Someone's asking, Tophlitz on Reddit asks if
I was part of the Black Rock City cuddle puddle.

1254
01:24:46,982 --> 01:24:48,472
TRAVIS: What?

1255
01:24:48,472 --> 01:24:55,567
MATT: Burning Man. Yes, I was. Good to hear from
you. That's really cool. It's a Burning Man

1256
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:57,794
gathering event. It's really cool.

1257
01:24:57,794 --> 01:25:00,500
WILL: The Black Rock City cuddle puddle?

1258
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,626
TRAVIS: Cuddle puddle.

1259
01:25:01,626 --> 01:25:03,706
MARY: Are you guys dressed as rabbits?

1260
01:25:03,706 --> 01:25:05,472
MATT: No, that's the Billion Bunny March.

1261
01:25:05,472 --> 01:25:08,326
MARISHA: Not to be confused--

1262
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:12,378
MATT: This is a bunch of strangers all getting
together and cuddling and hanging out and telling

1263
01:25:12,378 --> 01:25:13,738
stories.

1264
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:15,886
MARISHA: Whereas the Billion Bunny March is a
bunch of strangers dressing up as bunnies and

1265
01:25:15,886 --> 01:25:17,507
protesting The Man.

1266
01:25:17,507 --> 01:25:23,774
TRAVIS: How often do you rewatch episodes? Only if
I feel like I missed something important. But

1267
01:25:23,774 --> 01:25:27,348
normally, that's a character choice, too. But I
don't catch shit.

1268
01:25:27,348 --> 01:25:30,001
MATT: I'll rewatch beats of previous episodes as
I'm preparing for the next one to make sure I

1269
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:35,693
remember all the details of how it ended and try
to pick up from there. Try. Doesn't always work,

1270
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:38,078
but I try. And to remember NPC voices.

1271
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:42,887
MARISHA: Good question. Marisha, are you going to
Awaken Trinket someday? No! I'm not.

1272
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:44,416
MARY: What does that mean?

1273
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:52,799
MARISHA: No, and that's my Quivering Palm
question, is "Are you going to Awaken Trinket?"

1274
01:25:52,799 --> 01:26:00,426
No. I can't, actually. Trinket is literally too
smart for me to awaken him, and if I ever did, it

1275
01:26:00,426 --> 01:26:07,247
would mean that Trinket could theoretically be
like, "Oh, what? You've been my master this whole

1276
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:12,053
"time, Vex? Well, fuck this shit. I'm out." And I
don't want to ever do that, so no!

1277
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:13,613
TRAVIS: I wouldn't ever do that.

1278
01:26:13,613 --> 01:26:17,221
MARISHA: It's her bear. It's Vex's bear.

1279
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:19,975
MARY: What does that mean to awaken?

1280
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:24,051
MATT: It's a spell that druids have. Creatures
that have certain low-level intelligence, you give

1281
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:27,675
them human intelligence and the ability to speak
and converse. They essentially become NPCs.

1282
01:26:27,675 --> 01:26:29,530
MARISHA: Do we want to read it?

1283
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,038
TRAVIS: How smart is Trinket?

1284
01:26:31,038 --> 01:26:34,287
MATT: Trinket has an intelligence of four. Smarter
than the average bear.

1285
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:37,380
(groaning)

1286
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:42,782
TRAVIS: That's so low-hanging, and you-- It's
running down the jowls.

1287
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:44,438
MATT: And yet, it is 100 percent accurate.

1288
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:45,676
TRAVIS and MARY: It is.

1289
01:26:45,676 --> 01:26:50,980
MARISHA: The target must either have no
intelligence score or an intelligence of three or

1290
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,042
less.

1291
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:54,405
MARY: And what is Grog's intelligence?

1292
01:26:54,405 --> 01:26:55,613
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Six.

1293
01:26:55,613 --> 01:26:58,171
WILL: He says proudly. Six.

1294
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:02,225
TRAVIS: I remember when we were rolling the
character and I rolled it, and it was some awful

1295
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:08,539
roll, and you're like, "Your intelligence is six."
I was like, "Yay! What's that mean?"

1296
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:18,290
MATT: I cannot implore you guys enough to really
embrace low stats as a character. It's such a

1297
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:21,931
wonderful distinguishing trait for your
roleplaying capability. I'm disappointed when a

1298
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:25,653
player doesn't roll anything lower than a ten. I'm
like, oh, man. What a missed opportunity. I

1299
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:31,631
absolutely adore, as a player and as a DM, rolling
at least one or two low stats, because it really

1300
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:36,752
exemplifies all sorts of crazy shenanigans you're
going to get into in the future.

1301
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:40,195
WILL: That totally gave me my character, because I
didn't know what I was going to do. Did I want an

1302
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:43,579
accent? I had no idea. And then I rolled a nine
charisma, and I was like, he's a dick.

1303
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:45,361
TRAVIS: Yes! Awesome.

1304
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:49,837
MATT: Which also, I want to point out, is another
great example. Both you and Keyleth are great

1305
01:27:49,837 --> 01:27:56,344
examples of characters that have low charisma. A
lot of people equate charisma to physicality and

1306
01:27:56,344 --> 01:28:00,364
appearance and beauty, and that is one way to do
it. For some people, they look like the kind of

1307
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:05,471
person you would listen to or follow. Very
politician-like. They have this spirit to them,

1308
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:10,607
and this visual perspective. You guys are
relatively attractive characters, but

1309
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:13,536
personality-wise-- not you, your D&D characters.

1310
01:28:13,536 --> 01:28:16,803
WILL and MARISHA: Oh. Sure.

1311
01:28:16,803 --> 01:28:18,832
TRAVIS: Yeah, you two are total trainwrecks.

1312
01:28:18,832 --> 01:28:20,631
MARY: Keyleth is fucking hot.

1313
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:23,048
MARISHA: That's why we do voiceover!

1314
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,329
MATT: Exactly.

1315
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:26,409
WILL: I've got the body for voice over.

1316
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:28,558
MARY: And a face for radio.

1317
01:28:28,558 --> 01:28:34,168
MATT: But a perfect example. Kashaw has such an
abrasive personality that even the most average

1318
01:28:34,168 --> 01:28:39,649
individual is more likeable in general, despite
your appearance, than Kashaw is. You rub everyone

1319
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:42,470
the wrong way, and that's the perfect way to play
a nine-charisma character.

1320
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:45,972
WILL: It was so much fun to play that, and also,
it's one of those things where he does things

1321
01:28:45,972 --> 01:28:49,539
where it's this great juxtaposition where he's a
dick, and he tried to intimidate the last time.

1322
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:55,838
He's got a minus-one for intimidation, so he's
like, "How's your family? This isn't going to

1323
01:28:55,838 --> 01:29:01,458
"work." It's like if I tried to intimidate
somebody. Not going to work. All right, sorry.

1324
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:03,426
TRAVIS: How's your family? They're doing well.

1325
01:29:03,426 --> 01:29:05,177
MARY: Thanks for asking.

1326
01:29:05,177 --> 01:29:06,569
TRAVIS: The boy's in soccer.

1327
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:11,819
WILL: It was so much fun to let the numbers
dictate. I wasn't used to that, so yeah. It helped

1328
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:13,148
the character.

1329
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:16,517
MATT: Someone asked here, Matt, have you ever
considered dwarves with not-Scottish accents?

1330
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:22,561
Yeah. I love the Scottish brogue. It's my favorite
dialect of all, and so I revel in the chance to

1331
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:27,166
utilize it, and I've grown up around fantasy
tropes of the Scottish dwarf. The Kraghammer

1332
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:31,273
dwarves are definitively mostly Scottish. They
have some variations in there. There's some West

1333
01:29:31,273 --> 01:29:35,938
Country. There's some that fall out a bit. Dwarves
in other regions would probably have different

1334
01:29:35,938 --> 01:29:39,688
dialects, so if ever you guys travel to other
regions and meet other regional dwarves, perhaps

1335
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:47,811
there will be variations. Let's see if they have
any other ones. We've got time for another ten

1336
01:29:47,811 --> 01:29:50,899
minutes of questions before we'll take a short
break, and we'll come back for our battle

1337
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:52,343
free-for-all.

1338
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:54,159
MARY: Zahra doesn't know about Percy and Lillith.

1339
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:54,942
TRAVIS: She doesn't?

1340
01:29:54,942 --> 01:30:01,835
MARY: Nope. Zahra got a letter from Lillith saying
that she had an interesting time with the guys in

1341
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:07,582
Emon, but she didn't name names. Lillith is not a
kiss-and-tell.

1342
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:09,481
WILL: Kashaw is.

1343
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:11,018
(laughter)

1344
01:30:11,018 --> 01:30:13,691
WILL: Telling everybody what just happened.

1345
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:17,920
MARY: She told me about the world itself, but not
specifically--

1346
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:23,698
TRAVIS: What happens to Vox Machina when everyone
reaches level 20, or something like that?

1347
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:33,276
MATT: Oh, that's a good question. I'm foreseeing,
currently, the campaign has probably another good

1348
01:30:33,276 --> 01:30:39,174
year, little over a year, before everyone were to
reach max level. I don't know if we'll get that

1349
01:30:39,174 --> 01:30:44,345
far. There is a definitive arc to the story, and
it will progress to the point where the heroic

1350
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:52,493
deeds of Vox Machina-- hopefully, whoever survives
to that point-- will be battling deities, and not

1351
01:30:52,493 --> 01:31:02,341
just worlds, but also realm-saving circumstances.
At which point, there will come a moment where the

1352
01:31:02,341 --> 01:31:07,178
story comes to completion, whether it be through
the fall of Vox Machina and the next wave of

1353
01:31:07,178 --> 01:31:11,905
heroes that rise up to try and take that place, or
they will complete their goal, become the heroes

1354
01:31:11,905 --> 01:31:16,073
of the land, and fade into the sunset to pursue
whatever their epilogue-based storyline is, which

1355
01:31:16,073 --> 01:31:17,854
you guys would help to write.

1356
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:20,917
MARY: They come back through the wardrobe, and
they're kids again.

1357
01:31:20,917 --> 01:31:27,868
MATT: In which case, I would like to start a new
campaign with the new level-one characters you

1358
01:31:27,868 --> 01:31:31,718
guys would create, probably in the same world,
after the events of the first campaign. There

1359
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:34,846
would be elements of the universe that you've
affected with your choices.

1360
01:31:34,846 --> 01:31:36,229
MARY: Lycan rat.

1361
01:31:36,229 --> 01:31:37,801
MARISHA: I was going to say, were-rat.

1362
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:42,250
TRAVIS: Have you ever made a character that went
to level 20, anybody that's played before?

1363
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,395
MATT: I've had a campaign that went close, but not
quite.

1364
01:31:45,395 --> 01:31:47,742
TRAVIS: What do you mean "not quite?" Meaning you
stopped playing?

1365
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:51,664
MATT: Meaning we stopped playing, because adults
get busy and lives scatter.

1366
01:31:51,664 --> 01:31:53,169
MARISHA: Was that the Ravenloft campaign?

1367
01:31:53,169 --> 01:31:58,736
MATT: The Ravenloft campaign ended at 15, and the
previous campaign ended around 15, as well.

1368
01:31:58,736 --> 01:32:00,014
TRAVIS: Deities?

1369
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,328
MARY: There's some spells that you only find on
another plane.

1370
01:32:02,328 --> 01:32:04,376
MARISHA: Eventually, we go god hunting.

1371
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:09,357
TRAVIS: God hunting? Did you see the size of that
dragon back there? We're <i>fucked</i> next to that

1372
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:10,297
thing.

1373
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:11,929
MARISHA: Ghostbusters-style god hunting.

1374
01:32:11,929 --> 01:32:13,215
WILL: Are you a god?

1375
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:15,469
MARISHA: If someone asks if you're a god--

1376
01:32:15,469 --> 01:32:17,633
MARISHA, MARY, and TRAVIS: You say yes!

1377
01:32:17,633 --> 01:32:20,987
MATT: TiamatZX asks: Question for Mary. What are
your thoughts on the friendship between Vex and

1378
01:32:20,987 --> 01:32:22,881
Zahra?

1379
01:32:22,881 --> 01:32:35,585
MARY: Oh. Wouldn't you like to know? Maybe you'll
find out. I think Zahra has not had many friends

1380
01:32:35,585 --> 01:32:38,288
in her life. I'll put it that way.

1381
01:32:38,288 --> 01:32:40,482
WILL: Neither has Kash.

1382
01:32:40,482 --> 01:32:46,985
MARY: Yeah, and those that she does have, the few
she holds very dear, and I don't think that level of

1383
01:32:46,985 --> 01:32:54,678
devotion has any idea-- it's a level of passion
that goes beyond the plane of physical,

1384
01:32:54,678 --> 01:33:00,087
attractive. There's an attraction to someone's
soul, and I think that's what she feels.

1385
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:04,731
WILL: I think Kash is the same way, where it's
almost confusing to be with somebody that you

1386
01:33:04,731 --> 01:33:06,506
actually care about.

1387
01:33:06,506 --> 01:33:11,243
MARISHA: Keyleth feels some of that. It's a weird
feeling sometimes.

1388
01:33:11,243 --> 01:33:16,589
MATT: Quick question to answer here, since I get
questions about house rules a lot. Why did you

1389
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:20,220
choose to make inspiration-- the normal one, not a
bardic one-- a d6 instead of the default

1390
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,419
advantage? That was partially because there are a
lot of abilities and situations that give you

1391
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:29,995
advantage already in the game. I felt it would be
a tweak where you could, in theory, combine the

1392
01:33:29,995 --> 01:33:34,339
two. I like the disadvantage and advantage system
a lot. I think it's one of the best things they

1393
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:38,567
did in 5th edition to streamline combat and get
rid of a lot of the floating modifiers that I felt

1394
01:33:38,567 --> 01:33:43,128
bogged down combat in other systems. I felt like
this was a way to incorporate it where those that

1395
01:33:43,128 --> 01:33:47,685
could still get advantage and <i>consistently</i> get
advantage, based on how they play, would still be

1396
01:33:47,685 --> 01:33:51,635
able to benefit from the inspiration die. Mind
you, because there's a bard in the party, and such

1397
01:33:51,635 --> 01:33:54,994
a good bard, I don't feel that I have to throw it
out there too often. You guys are pretty

1398
01:33:54,994 --> 01:33:57,186
self-sufficient in giving your own inspiration.

1399
01:33:57,186 --> 01:33:58,967
WILL: That's amazing, watching him.

1400
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:03,198
TRAVIS: Isn't it? If you want to talk about
genius, we've got genius doing storytelling. I've

1401
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:09,542
asked him. I'm like, "Do you come to the show with
two or three songs in your pocket ready to go?"

1402
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:14,643
And he says no, because he's a cappella-- Mensa
level, from college, right?

1403
01:34:14,643 --> 01:34:16,441
MARY: The fight song, come on.

1404
01:34:16,441 --> 01:34:22,022
MARISHA: He has the limericks. He's been writing
down the limericks. That's been a very new thing,

1405
01:34:22,022 --> 01:34:29,140
though. He'll be like, "I've been listening to Top
40 more recently." That's pretty much all he said.

1406
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,117
He's like, "I'm trying to listen to the radio
more."

1407
01:34:31,117 --> 01:34:32,879
WILL: It's amazing to sit there. Damn.

1408
01:34:32,879 --> 01:34:34,856
MARISHA: He's crazy. He's great.

1409
01:34:34,856 --> 01:34:36,269
WILL: Totally awesome.

1410
01:34:36,269 --> 01:34:37,874
MARISHA: It's all that UCB training.

1411
01:34:37,874 --> 01:34:45,537
MARY: I'm pretty sure I saw him and his sister
Eden in Les Mis when they were in it on Broadway.

1412
01:34:45,537 --> 01:34:47,718
WILL: Oh, who hasn't been in Les Mis on Broadway?

1413
01:34:47,718 --> 01:34:51,506
TRAVIS: Let's wave a flag over some furniture.

1414
01:34:51,506 --> 01:34:57,959
WILL: We can't eat bread! Okay, I get you. Come
on. Take your prison time and shut up.

1415
01:34:57,959 --> 01:35:00,096
(laughter)

1416
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:08,521
MARISHA: His story, by the way, at this Wizard
World panel.

1417
01:35:08,521 --> 01:35:09,532
MARY: Oh, it was amazing.

1418
01:35:09,532 --> 01:35:12,913
MARISHA: Yeah, if anyone hasn't seen the Wizard
World panel, he has a story of him as Gavroche

1419
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:19,661
falling off the barricades, and it was in the
middle of the Miami riots, back in the day, and he

1420
01:35:19,661 --> 01:35:23,232
went to the hospital and was like, "I fell off the
barricade." He's all smudgy.

1421
01:35:23,232 --> 01:35:25,775
TRAVIS: The doctor's like, "You were on the
<i>barricade</i>?"

1422
01:35:25,775 --> 01:35:28,233
MATT: This little kid.

1423
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:38,036
WILL: He's dressed like a French peasant. "My god,
boy, what the hell were they doing to you? Why are

1424
01:35:38,036 --> 01:35:39,954
"you still harmonizing? My god."

1425
01:35:39,954 --> 01:35:45,194
MARISHA: You have to watch him tell it, though. We
can't even do it justice, but it's great. It's a

1426
01:35:45,194 --> 01:35:46,592
good story.

1427
01:35:46,592 --> 01:35:51,719
MATT: Let's see. We've got time for a few more
questions, and then we're going to take a break

1428
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:53,300
and come back for the free-for-all.

1429
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,592
WILL: Oh my god, I've got minutes to live.

1430
01:35:54,592 --> 01:35:55,745
MATT: Yes, you do.

1431
01:35:55,745 --> 01:35:57,682
MARY: It's going to be so exciting!

1432
01:35:57,682 --> 01:36:01,222
MATT: Interesting question. Matt, have you ever
gotten a TPK or killed most of the players in the

1433
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:06,534
party? Yes, actually. In the last campaign I ran,
the players went into the Shadowfell, and in this

1434
01:36:06,534 --> 01:36:11,204
particular world, necromancy had been banned and
outlawed for a hundred years, so undead and the

1435
01:36:11,204 --> 01:36:18,287
whole idea of undead creatures largely was
folklore. No one saw them. People thought they

1436
01:36:18,287 --> 01:36:22,415
were old wives' tales to keep kids in from
outside. And so when they actually went to the

1437
01:36:22,415 --> 01:36:27,951
Shadowfell, they were unprepared, wandered into a
tomb, and were surrounded by ghouls, and as

1438
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:33,401
opposed to focused, targeting down, they decided,
"Each of us take one!" and kill them off. Well,

1439
01:36:33,401 --> 01:36:43,431
then three of the five were immediately paralyzed
and were torn down, and two of the remaining party

1440
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:47,273
members, one of them started screaming while the
other grabbed her and pulled her out as they

1441
01:36:47,273 --> 01:36:50,498
watched the three other party members be devoured
by the ghouls that were there.

1442
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:55,257
MARISHA: Remember how when we were fighting the
banshees, they have an ability where they can

1443
01:36:55,257 --> 01:36:58,996
touch you and you're down? Ghouls have a similar
ability where they touch you and you're paralyzed,

1444
01:36:58,996 --> 01:37:07,374
and you get canned. So if you split up, the divide
and conquer technique is probably the worst that

1445
01:37:07,374 --> 01:37:09,432
you could use against ghouls.

1446
01:37:09,432 --> 01:37:10,807
WILL: Backs to each other.

1447
01:37:10,807 --> 01:37:12,016
MARISHA: Yeah, pretty much.

1448
01:37:12,016 --> 01:37:15,358
MATT: In that circumstance, they lost three party
members in one battle that were eaten. They

1449
01:37:15,358 --> 01:37:16,624
watched them be eaten in front of them.

1450
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:17,975
MARY: Oh, that's awful.

1451
01:37:17,975 --> 01:37:21,589
WILL: Now what do you do? Quick question. What do
you do? You're playing with seven players and you

1452
01:37:21,589 --> 01:37:26,080
put them in a situation where four die. How do you
come back next week with the three that are left?

1453
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:30,096
MATT: What I do is in that time period, I would
get with the players that lost characters--

1454
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:32,610
MARY: Why is he pointing to you?

1455
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:33,996
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1456
01:37:33,996 --> 01:37:39,537
MATT: Because you're there! I would see if the
remaining party members had options in which to

1457
01:37:39,537 --> 01:37:44,674
attempt resurrection at their disposal, see if
that was successful or not, preferably before the

1458
01:37:44,674 --> 01:37:47,754
end of that session. If any of those were not
successful and the players were lost permanently,

1459
01:37:47,754 --> 01:37:51,195
then over the next week, I would meet with the
players that lost characters to have them create

1460
01:37:51,195 --> 01:37:54,065
new ones, probably a level lower than the lowest
member of the party--

1461
01:37:54,065 --> 01:37:57,513
WILL: And meet up with them?

1462
01:37:57,513 --> 01:38:00,285
MATT: And meet up with them, and find a way to
incorporate them in the story where they would

1463
01:38:00,285 --> 01:38:04,463
then become a member of Vox Machina going forward.
It's what I've done before, in the past. There is

1464
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:08,926
a detriment to losing your character. I do bring
you in a level lower. Not starting at level one,

1465
01:38:08,926 --> 01:38:10,342
because that would be stupid.

1466
01:38:10,342 --> 01:38:11,636
WILL: You also lose your character.

1467
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:12,781
MATT: Exactly.

1468
01:38:12,781 --> 01:38:14,031
WILL: Horrible.

1469
01:38:14,031 --> 01:38:17,044
MATT: That's how I would do it. That's how I will
do it.

1470
01:38:17,044 --> 01:38:19,253
(groaning)

1471
01:38:19,253 --> 01:38:28,622
MATT: (cackles) All right, each of us pick a
question to finish this off, if we can. I'm sorry

1472
01:38:28,622 --> 01:38:31,392
if we didn't get to your questions. This is a lot
of questions here tonight, and not a whole lot of

1473
01:38:31,392 --> 01:38:34,228
time. We have record of these; I'll try and answer
them on Reddit later.

1474
01:38:34,228 --> 01:38:39,282
TRAVIS: Somebody asked if I could re-pick the
people that went into the Earthbreaker Groon pit,

1475
01:38:39,282 --> 01:38:46,146
would I do it? No. A, I didn't understand what you
were actually asking, because he was speaking in

1476
01:38:46,146 --> 01:38:50,320
such a poetic way, and I was trying to give you an
intense struggle. "Shit, I'm missing all of this.

1477
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:55,723
"I don't know what he's talking about." And you
were like, "Who are your blah-blah-blah muses?"

1478
01:38:55,723 --> 01:39:02,917
And I was like, "My muses? Pike. She's not here.
Shit. In case we fight, who's good? Oh, Vax has

1479
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:07,805
"daggers, and Scanlan's my pal." And we jumped down
and they're like, "Oh, we're fighting." And I was

1480
01:39:07,805 --> 01:39:09,417
like, "Fuck!"

1481
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:12,796
WILL: The second he got pushed into the pit, I saw
your face go, "Aw, shit."

1482
01:39:12,796 --> 01:39:15,397
MARISHA: I misunderstood the question.

1483
01:39:15,397 --> 01:39:17,375
WILL: All the blood drained from your face.

1484
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:21,306
TRAVIS: The first five minutes, I was going
through my mind, how it would have gone if I had

1485
01:39:21,306 --> 01:39:23,773
picked other people, but I wouldn't have changed
it for a second.

1486
01:39:23,773 --> 01:39:26,049
MARISHA: It was great.

1487
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:27,835
MARY: Vax and Scanlan.

1488
01:39:27,835 --> 01:39:29,141
TRAVIS: It was so great.

1489
01:39:29,141 --> 01:39:30,515
MARISHA: It worked beautifully.

1490
01:39:30,515 --> 01:39:37,030
MARY: Oh, will we see Salty Pete and the gang
again?

1491
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:38,537
MATT: I don't know.

1492
01:39:38,537 --> 01:39:40,770
MARISHA and MARY: I don't know.

1493
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:46,190
MATT: One of the members is up in Seattle now, and
another member only occasionally comes on for

1494
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:51,520
another game. Maybe! It was fun. Definitely a
unique experience doing that. If we have another

1495
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,530
Extra Life-type stream like we did, because that
was very successful, and we had a good time with

1496
01:39:55,530 --> 01:40:01,994
it. As much as it was a gamut for me to run, with
you guys helping with the story-- deck of many

1497
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:05,535
things-- if it happens again, I would love to have
them all back, so we'll see if we can get them and

1498
01:40:05,535 --> 01:40:07,508
schedule them for it. I hope so.

1499
01:40:07,508 --> 01:40:11,891
MARY: Oh, that was good. Somebody said, what color
dragons would you all be?

1500
01:40:11,891 --> 01:40:14,512
MATT: What color dragons would you be?

1501
01:40:14,512 --> 01:40:15,802
MARISHA: In real life or our characters?

1502
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:18,379
MATT: Let's say in real life.

1503
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:19,698
MARISHA: In real life?

1504
01:40:19,698 --> 01:40:22,647
MATT: I can't answer a character question. All of
them! No.

1505
01:40:22,647 --> 01:40:24,389
MARISHA: Red.

1506
01:40:24,389 --> 01:40:26,455
TRAVIS: Ain't those the bad ones?

1507
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:27,838
MATT: Yeah.

1508
01:40:27,838 --> 01:40:29,001
TRAVIS: You would be a bad dragon in real life?

1509
01:40:29,001 --> 01:40:33,097
MARISHA: That fire-breathing, man. Fire dragons.

1510
01:40:33,097 --> 01:40:36,916
WILL: "You'd be a bad dragon?" That was such an
earnest question.

1511
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:38,250
TRAVIS: I was expecting more from you.

1512
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:40,661
MARISHA: A chromatic dragon, just peaced-out--

1513
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:42,191
TRAVIS: Whatever, Voldemort. Shut up.

1514
01:40:42,191 --> 01:40:45,126
WILL: She Who Must Not Be Named.

1515
01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:49,841
TRAVIS: I'd be a gold dragon.

1516
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:51,464
MARY: Would you be a gold dragon?

1517
01:40:51,464 --> 01:40:53,461
TRAVIS: I'd call myself Kanye.

1518
01:40:53,461 --> 01:40:56,532
MARISHA: So influential.

1519
01:40:56,532 --> 01:41:02,536
TRAVIS: I'm a wordsmith. You're welcome for my
existence. I'm an influencer.

1520
01:41:02,536 --> 01:41:07,076
MATT: I'm going to make you play that if we ever
do a one-shot.

1521
01:41:07,076 --> 01:41:09,559
(laughter)

1522
01:41:09,559 --> 01:41:12,250
TRAVIS: I'll start smiling and then go--

1523
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,346
MATT: There you go.

1524
01:41:14,346 --> 01:41:21,612
WILL: I've got a good question from Twitter. How
open were you for me to create my own deity as a

1525
01:41:21,612 --> 01:41:22,612
cleric?

1526
01:41:22,612 --> 01:41:24,056
MATT: I was very open.

1527
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:30,319
WILL: You were suggesting to make one up if you
want to make one up. I don't know how other DMs

1528
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:36,861
run the game, but you were very open to suggestion
and here's what you could do, and let me help you

1529
01:41:36,861 --> 01:41:40,978
a little bit here, but it was more "what do you
want to be?" and you guided me, as opposed to

1530
01:41:40,978 --> 01:41:42,850
"this is what you do, and here's how you build
it."

1531
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:48,089
MARY: You encourage that. I was like, I've done
research and I want to do this. You're like, "No,

1532
01:41:48,089 --> 01:41:53,450
"don't pick anything that's established. You run
into problems with people nitpicking what you got

1533
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:58,047
"wrong about the lore and everything else. Make
your own." Which was so wonderful.

1534
01:41:58,047 --> 01:41:59,783
WILL: They always say write what you know.

1535
01:41:59,783 --> 01:42:04,377
MATT: Tailor it to the rules. So for you, your
whole moon deity worked well for the Great Old One

1536
01:42:04,377 --> 01:42:08,630
pact because it was an entity that is outside of
the pantheon and you don't truly understand the

1537
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:12,883
nature of where it comes from, just from the sky.
It was a perfect tie-in to that. And with you, I

1538
01:42:12,883 --> 01:42:17,108
didn't want to define anything, and I said, "You
can choose from the existing pantheon of the

1539
01:42:17,108 --> 01:42:20,882
"world," and I laid those out for you, and I said,
"You can create your own deity, but understand

1540
01:42:20,882 --> 01:42:23,903
"that based on the current rules that it would
probably be a much more confined belief system; a

1541
01:42:23,903 --> 01:42:28,701
"god that doesn't have the same following of the
others. Thus, why it's a receded worship than

1542
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:30,801
"other gods."

1543
01:42:30,801 --> 01:42:34,478
WILL: Which then guided the backstory of how
nobody's ever heard of Vesh, and there's one

1544
01:42:34,478 --> 01:42:36,972
person that knows who she is, and that's Kashaw.

1545
01:42:36,972 --> 01:42:38,333
MATT: It worked out perfectly.

1546
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:40,414
WILL: It worked out great, so yeah, it was very
cool.

1547
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:48,465
MARISHA: I had a question scroll by, and forgive
me, I didn't see the name of who it was, but they

1548
01:42:48,465 --> 01:42:57,880
were asking about being a female playing D&D in an
all-boy group and how you break that comfort

1549
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:05,024
level. Luckily, I think, especially now with the
resurgence of D&D, the boy's club aspect that

1550
01:43:05,024 --> 01:43:12,369
might have been surrounding it is definitely
slowly starting to get broken. D&D should never be

1551
01:43:12,369 --> 01:43:21,955
a gender-specific game at all. It's tough. It's
also where you grew up and where you're located

1552
01:43:21,955 --> 01:43:29,317
and the part of the country. I know, growing up in
Kentucky, I didn't have access to anybody,

1553
01:43:29,317 --> 01:43:37,590
especially other females that would want to play
with me. But yeah, if you feel uncomfortable, I

1554
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:46,464
try to remember that it's probably a little bit of
them feeling uncomfortable on their end, as well,

1555
01:43:46,464 --> 01:43:53,644
so try to be open-minded to that, and I think
you'll get used to it, but there's not supposed to

1556
01:43:53,644 --> 01:44:05,218
be gender specifics. And guys, we have a ton of
our players that like to RP girls. We're all

1557
01:44:05,218 --> 01:44:11,869
actors. Maybe the best way if you're a female in
an all-guy group, fuck it, make a male character,

1558
01:44:11,869 --> 01:44:13,290
as well.

1559
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:20,050
MARY: Or be the strongest, most feminine
role-playing character that you can be.

1560
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:26,304
WILL: I'm sorry, I should mention that the guy who
asked that question was @paleheathen, whose

1561
01:44:26,304 --> 01:44:29,132
picture is actually with you and Laura.

1562
01:44:29,132 --> 01:44:31,935
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like him.

1563
01:44:31,935 --> 01:44:37,813
MATT: Good question. I will say, too, I've played
with many players that have created characters

1564
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:44,109
that are across sex. Male players who made female
characters and vice versa. You see me play female

1565
01:44:44,109 --> 01:44:49,268
characters all the time. It's not a defining facet
of the character.

1566
01:44:49,268 --> 01:44:52,865
MARISHA: Female should never be a personality
trait.

1567
01:44:52,865 --> 01:44:58,176
MATT: Yeah, exactly. It can guide elements to it
down the road, but you want to create an

1568
01:44:58,176 --> 01:45:04,271
interesting character who just happens to be male
or female. I know some people have some weirdness

1569
01:45:04,271 --> 01:45:07,523
or they're not comfortable trying to play someone
of the opposite sex, and that's totally fine, but

1570
01:45:07,523 --> 01:45:10,988
you'd be surprised how cool it is sometimes to
jump into the character that's so different from

1571
01:45:10,988 --> 01:45:14,074
what you're used to and see how one, it can be a
very freeing experience from a role-playing

1572
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:16,772
standpoint, and you might learn a lot about
yourself.

1573
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:20,860
MARISHA: Actually, there's a really great video
that's on YouTube that someone linked me to this

1574
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:29,498
past week, and it was from about three years ago
before the Fine Brothers milked this format, and

1575
01:45:29,498 --> 01:45:39,262
it was boys, a group of ten-year-old boys playing
Dungeons & Dragons with a group of girls for the

1576
01:45:39,262 --> 01:45:49,162
first time. Did you see that? Yeah, and it was
great, and I love kid logic, because I feel like

1577
01:45:49,162 --> 01:45:57,591
it really simplifies what we're all actually
thinking on its purest form, and all the boys at

1578
01:45:57,591 --> 01:46:03,286
the end of it were super mature and were like,
"Oh, this is great." They were like, "The girls

1579
01:46:03,286 --> 01:46:12,938
"were really bloody and violent. I thought they
would puke at the blood. I didn't know that girls

1580
01:46:12,938 --> 01:46:22,091
"could be that violent." I'm like, yeah, man. So I
feel like the kids realizing that there really is

1581
01:46:22,091 --> 01:46:27,544
no separation is quintessential, how everyone
feels.

1582
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:29,692
WILL: It's also a flat-out awesome improv
exercise.

1583
01:46:29,692 --> 01:46:30,979
MARY: It really is.

1584
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:34,965
WILL: It really is, to play the opposite sex, for
no other reason that it's really cool to open up

1585
01:46:34,965 --> 01:46:36,862
and be free.

1586
01:46:36,862 --> 01:46:42,920
MARISHA: And ultimately, to be 100 percent honest,
I really enjoy people who have implemented

1587
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:47,242
Dungeons & Dragons in elementary schools as
teaching mechanisms, and there have been a lot of

1588
01:46:47,242 --> 01:46:54,047
people who've used it for kids who have social
imperatives or social awkwardness things in real

1589
01:46:54,047 --> 01:46:55,037
life.

1590
01:46:55,037 --> 01:46:58,099
WILL: I deal with anxiety, so I know exactly what
it's like to deal with that kind of stuff.

1591
01:46:58,099 --> 01:47:04,051
MARISHA: Yeah, totally, and I think it really does
teach you empathy on a different level, and you

1592
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:09,637
really can put yourself in the shoes of someone
else that you're probably nothing else like.

1593
01:47:09,637 --> 01:47:17,243
Keyleth has taught me a ton. Playing Keyleth has
taught me a ton because I don't really consider

1594
01:47:17,243 --> 01:47:23,775
myself anything like her in real life, so playing
something super empathetic, she's taught me a lot,

1595
01:47:23,775 --> 01:47:28,035
and I think everyone can learn from that. That's
my tangent. I'm done.

1596
01:47:28,035 --> 01:47:32,075
MATT: One more question. This one's come up quite
a few times from different people. Someone's

1597
01:47:32,075 --> 01:47:37,234
asking about balancing encounters for creatures
that could easily take down one member of the

1598
01:47:37,234 --> 01:47:41,182
party but would also be difficult to fight for
another-- that would be a good challenge for one

1599
01:47:41,182 --> 01:47:45,979
member but would completely annihilate another
person in the party. How to handle that. How does

1600
01:47:45,979 --> 01:47:50,974
the party handle that? That's a great point of
tension in the battle. If a player knows that

1601
01:47:50,974 --> 01:47:54,663
they're squishy, their tactics should revolve
around learning how to stay away from that

1602
01:47:54,663 --> 01:47:57,582
creature that could probably take them down very
quickly, and it's the tougher members of the

1603
01:47:57,582 --> 01:48:01,489
party's responsibility to try and get between them
as much as possible.

1604
01:48:01,489 --> 01:48:05,531
WILL: That was Sam last week. He's the first one
who said that. He's like, "I don't fight, so I'm

1605
01:48:05,531 --> 01:48:08,539
"going to sing and run this way."

1606
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:15,284
MATT: So yeah, you want to incorporate aspects of
a battle that will be a challenge across the

1607
01:48:15,284 --> 01:48:19,393
party, but you also want to make sure that you
don't tailor every enemy specifically to a player

1608
01:48:19,393 --> 01:48:23,705
all the time, like "This guy's a barbarian. He has
a lot of good resistance, so I'll build a creature

1609
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:28,038
"only for him," and then go for this character.
Find a good challenge for the overall party and

1610
01:48:28,038 --> 01:48:31,873
let them figure out the mechanics. Sometimes
they'll run really well and combo their abilities

1611
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:36,010
together like a well-oiled machine, and they'll
completely annihilate the encounter. Sometimes,

1612
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:41,263
they'll do the entirely wrong tactic that they
should, and end up walking away, limping, going,

1613
01:48:41,263 --> 01:48:46,290
"That was bad. That was very bad." Sometimes, it
will go really poorly and they have to run. That's

1614
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:51,572
the good thing, too. I always scale on the level
of making the encounter difficult, as opposed to

1615
01:48:51,572 --> 01:48:55,797
too easy, if you've done a few encounters that the
party has steamrolled, because if it gets too

1616
01:48:55,797 --> 01:49:02,141
hard, you can insinuate, you don't have to stick
around. They could always come back later with a

1617
01:49:02,141 --> 01:49:06,047
better plan if the first plan failed. In fact,
some fun battles are the vengeance ones, where

1618
01:49:06,047 --> 01:49:10,967
things didn't go so great the first time, but
going back with the knowledge you have now, you

1619
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:16,114
set up an ambush or find a way to use the terrain
to your advantage next time.

1620
01:49:16,114 --> 01:49:20,224
WILL: Real quick, do you have to be real careful
that you don't pick on one specific person too

1621
01:49:20,224 --> 01:49:23,430
much, like you keep attacking one character?

1622
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:26,995
MATT: It depends on the creature or monster that
they're fighting. If it's a beast-- if it's a

1623
01:49:26,995 --> 01:49:31,069
creature that is driven by instinct and isn't
super intelligent, it will go after whatever is

1624
01:49:31,069 --> 01:49:36,725
either the easiest and nearest kill or the thing
that apparently right now poses the biggest threat

1625
01:49:36,725 --> 01:49:42,154
to it. I try to think of the creature's mindset of
who it would go after, so if the battle begins and

1626
01:49:42,154 --> 01:49:46,697
all of a sudden the healer does something really
crazy and flashy and hurts the enemy, it might be

1627
01:49:46,697 --> 01:49:48,442
going after the healer for a while.

1628
01:49:48,442 --> 01:49:52,737
If it's a really intelligent creature, especially
if it's a well-trained combat veteran that knows

1629
01:49:52,737 --> 01:49:56,174
the strengths and weaknesses of different classes,
once a few rounds of combat have shown who

1630
01:49:56,174 --> 01:50:05,064
specializes in what, he may tell his team or
whoever he's commanding to focus down the healer

1631
01:50:05,064 --> 01:50:09,864
or the support class that's changing the tide of
the battle. If they know the barbarian's going to

1632
01:50:09,864 --> 01:50:13,014
resist the most damage, they'll ignore him for
now, take out the things that are supporting him

1633
01:50:13,014 --> 01:50:14,768
and keeping him up, and then we'll worry about him
later.

1634
01:50:14,768 --> 01:50:20,428
It's based on the intelligence of what they're
fighting, and I think for me, that's a lot of fun.

1635
01:50:20,428 --> 01:50:23,839
Sometimes it doesn't work out. Sometimes the party
comes up with a really cool plan and my really

1636
01:50:23,839 --> 01:50:28,504
awesome, interesting battle gets steamrolled. But
you know what? The players earned that victory.

1637
01:50:28,504 --> 01:50:31,995
I'm not going to fight and change numbers behind
the screen just because I wanted it to be cooler.

1638
01:50:31,995 --> 01:50:34,711
They earned that victory. I'll give it to them.

1639
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:37,738
TRAVIS: So glad we're not fighting him tonight
because I just got infinitely more nervous.

1640
01:50:37,738 --> 01:50:42,032
WILL: I'm sensing you'll be fine.

1641
01:50:42,032 --> 01:50:47,583
MATT: All right, guys. It is 9:00. We're going to
take a short bathroom break, and then we're going

1642
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:52,450
to come back here and see which one of these fools
is going to be the final standing fighter.

1643
01:50:52,450 --> 01:50:53,749
MARY: Place your bets!

1644
01:50:53,749 --> 01:50:55,569
WILL: I've got ten dollars on everybody but me.

1645
01:50:55,569 --> 02:03:57,498
[break]

1646
02:03:57,498 --> 02:03:58,872
MARISHA: --cock.

1647
02:03:58,872 --> 02:04:04,834
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, we're going to
see how this works out. Thank you, Marisha. So,

1648
02:04:04,834 --> 02:04:10,585
for the purposes of this, everyone's going to be
level 13, so bringing both Kashaw and Zahra up one

1649
02:04:10,585 --> 02:04:13,696
level. I need you guys to both roll additional hit
points right now, which we'll add to your

1650
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:20,729
character at the moment. So d6 for you. For you,
it'd be a d8, I'm pretty sure.

1651
02:04:20,729 --> 02:04:23,645
TRAVIS: Are you playing as Gilmore?

1652
02:04:23,645 --> 02:04:25,009
WILL: This is my eight, right?

1653
02:04:25,009 --> 02:04:27,952
MARISHA: That's a ten.

1654
02:04:27,952 --> 02:04:33,059
WILL: Five.

1655
02:04:33,059 --> 02:04:34,544
MARY: Four.

1656
02:04:34,544 --> 02:04:41,070
MATT: Four, plus your constitution modifier, which
is two. So yeah, that's 83. What'd you roll?

1657
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:42,309
WILL: I rolled a five.

1658
02:04:42,309 --> 02:04:43,940
MATT: You rolled a five plus, what's your
constitution modifier?

1659
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:45,365
WILL: 16. Oh, plus three.

1660
02:04:45,365 --> 02:04:47,948
MATT: Plus three, so eight. So, add eight to your
total hit points, for the purposes of this

1661
02:04:47,948 --> 02:04:48,998
battle.

1662
02:04:48,998 --> 02:04:50,405
WILL: So I am at 108 for this battle.

1663
02:04:50,405 --> 02:04:52,763
MATT: Oh wait, warlocks may be a d8. Let me go
check this again. I'm used to the sorcerer stuff.

1664
02:04:52,763 --> 02:04:54,608
Let me see here real fast.

1665
02:04:54,608 --> 02:05:02,007
TRAVIS: I'm going to do what Laura would do and
warm up this d20. Shit. Fuck. That's the same

1666
02:05:02,007 --> 02:05:03,114
number!

1667
02:05:03,114 --> 02:05:05,639
MATT: Yeah, a d8! I'm sorry, reroll it. I'm not
used to you warlocks.

1668
02:05:05,639 --> 02:05:07,809
MARY: What if I roll less than a four?

1669
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:09,277
MATT: Well, I'll let you keep the minimum.

1670
02:05:09,277 --> 02:05:11,877
MARY: I rolled a three.

1671
02:05:11,877 --> 02:05:13,906
MATT: We'll let you keep the four. It's my fault.

1672
02:05:13,906 --> 02:05:15,369
MARY: Oh, thank you.

1673
02:05:15,369 --> 02:05:20,662
WILL: Have I been killed yet? I'm surprised I'm
not dead yet, to be honest with you.

1674
02:05:20,662 --> 02:05:24,096
TRAVIS: We haven't started.

1675
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:27,948
WILL: I thought I was killed. My bad.

1676
02:05:27,948 --> 02:05:35,642
MATT: All righty, so. Since your proficiency
bonuses have also gone up, don't forget that your

1677
02:05:35,642 --> 02:05:42,407
spell attack, your spell DC, and your physical
attacks all go up by one. For this battle.

1678
02:05:42,407 --> 02:05:49,071
WILL: So, my spell attack goes to plus ten and my
spell DC goes to 18.

1679
02:05:49,071 --> 02:05:50,454
MATT: 18, correct.

1680
02:05:50,454 --> 02:05:52,290
TRAVIS: This set is amazing, by the way. I'm so
excited by it.

1681
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:57,859
MATT: This is my first time using Dwarven Forge
sets, which I've always wanted to. I was a

1682
02:05:57,859 --> 02:06:01,230
Kickstarter supporter when they first did the
dungeon tiles. I was stupid and didn't get them

1683
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:06,595
pre-painted. Never making that mistake again. So
I've dry-brushed all of these with white to make

1684
02:06:06,595 --> 02:06:13,273
them look decent. I hope to use more Dwarven Forge
stuff in the future, for our game, because it

1685
02:06:13,273 --> 02:06:17,344
makes for some really cool, dynamic-looking sets.
So. Just so you guys are aware, for this battle,

1686
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:21,971
this open pit here in the center is an open pit.
It falls into darkness. You don't know what's

1687
02:06:21,971 --> 02:06:22,910
below there.

1688
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:24,279
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Really?

1689
02:06:24,279 --> 02:06:25,677
MATT: Yeah, this is an open pit.

1690
02:06:25,677 --> 02:06:27,568
WILL: So Grog, push everyone. Push Grog into the
open pit.

1691
02:06:27,568 --> 02:06:31,994
MARY: It's an open pit? How deep is it?

1692
02:06:31,994 --> 02:06:36,744
TRAVIS: You don't know. "It falls into darkness."
So it's deep enough.

1693
02:06:36,744 --> 02:06:39,040
MATT: You'll have to go and make a perception
check next to it so you can see.

1694
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,200
TRAVIS: What if there's a giant trampoline down
there?

1695
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,871
MATT: Could be.

1696
02:06:41,871 --> 02:06:45,576
WILL: Has anybody thought about the idea of
meeting in the center and talking things out?

1697
02:06:45,576 --> 02:06:51,529
TRAVIS: I would like propose a pre-game handshake.
(under breath) I will throw all of you in.

1698
02:06:51,529 --> 02:06:55,586
MARISHA: Instead of violence, we can solve this
with rock paper scissors. It'll be great.

1699
02:06:55,586 --> 02:07:02,661
WILL: There was something you said about a
7th-level spell?

1700
02:07:02,661 --> 02:07:08,537
MATT: You and Zahra both get access to a single
7th-level spell casting. Also, you have access to

1701
02:07:08,537 --> 02:07:13,756
all the equipment you have on you, except for
healing potions. Each of you only has one superior

1702
02:07:13,756 --> 02:07:15,108
healing potion.

1703
02:07:15,108 --> 02:07:16,399
WILL: And what does a superior healing potion do?

1704
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:18,117
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

1705
02:07:18,117 --> 02:07:21,898
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

1706
02:07:21,898 --> 02:07:27,748
WILL: 8d4 plus eight. You'll have to explain to me
exactly what that means when I need it. Now, do we

1707
02:07:27,748 --> 02:07:32,749
need to pick our 7th-level spell now?

1708
02:07:32,749 --> 02:07:39,907
MATT: I would prefer for you to. I mean, you have
a couple prepared, but you have to choose which

1709
02:07:39,907 --> 02:07:41,752
one you use in combat.

1710
02:07:41,752 --> 02:07:46,947
MARISHA: So my armor, with spell resistance, I've
got advantage on spell attacks against me? I can

1711
02:07:46,947 --> 02:07:50,313
get saving throws? My armor that has spell
resistance?

1712
02:07:50,313 --> 02:07:53,197
MATT: You get advantage on your saving throws,
yes.

1713
02:07:53,197 --> 02:08:03,177
WILL: I think I know what I'm going for my
7th-level.

1714
02:08:03,177 --> 02:08:06,801
TRAVIS: I'm ready to die.

1715
02:08:06,801 --> 02:08:09,029
WILL: Seriously? Are you kidding me?

1716
02:08:09,029 --> 02:08:13,199
MARISHA: Oh my god, this is so nerve-wracking, you
guys.

1717
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:15,033
MATT: All righty, guys.

1718
02:08:15,033 --> 02:08:17,997
MARY: I'm very afeared now.

1719
02:08:17,997 --> 02:08:20,602
WILL: I got my 7th-level, I think.

1720
02:08:20,602 --> 02:08:31,433
MATT: All right, folks. I would like all of you...
to roll initiative! For the sake of this guys,

1721
02:08:31,433 --> 02:08:37,500
because I forgot my bag of side minis, which is
really stupid of me, the part of Kashaw will be

1722
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:45,303
played by this rather buxom dwarf cleric. The part
of Zahra will be played by this red-coated Percy.

1723
02:08:45,303 --> 02:08:51,057
So you guys can keep track on that. All right.

1724
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:54,064
MARY: I suck big balls and I cannot lie.

1725
02:08:54,064 --> 02:08:57,047
MATT: You know you have advantage on initiative?

1726
02:08:57,047 --> 02:08:58,780
TRAVIS: I rolled it twice and they both suck.

1727
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:06,809
MATT: As all of you are suddenly and
instantaneously transported by some omniscient

1728
02:09:06,809 --> 02:09:11,909
entity, you find your feet slamming into the stone
ground of what appears to be some pit, a hundred

1729
02:09:11,909 --> 02:09:17,764
feet recessed into the floor of some indeterminate
location. The walls and the floor are built of

1730
02:09:17,764 --> 02:09:23,152
ancient stone. You see each of you placed behind a
wall with just enough visual across the top to see

1731
02:09:23,152 --> 02:09:29,953
that the other of your band are there across from
you. In the center lies a darkened pit to some

1732
02:09:29,953 --> 02:09:32,154
unknown distance of depth.

1733
02:09:32,154 --> 02:09:33,387
MARISHA: Grog?

1734
02:09:33,387 --> 02:09:34,865
TRAVIS: This is nice stone!

1735
02:09:34,865 --> 02:09:36,111
WILL: Z?

1736
02:09:36,111 --> 02:09:37,713
MARY: Over here!

1737
02:09:37,713 --> 02:09:42,578
MATT: Looking up into the sky, you can see the
blue sky, clouds drifting above, but too high to

1738
02:09:42,578 --> 02:09:54,041
reach. You hear a voice rumble up from around you,
going, "Now, show me who is your champion." So,

1739
02:09:54,041 --> 02:10:01,527
initiative! 25 to 20, anyone? 20 to 15? (giggling)
15 to ten?

1740
02:10:01,527 --> 02:10:07,142
WILL: I have a 14. Oh wait, I'm adding my
initiative? Where's my initiative? Front, there we

1741
02:10:07,142 --> 02:10:08,262
go.

1742
02:10:08,262 --> 02:10:11,364
MARISHA: You have plus two.

1743
02:10:11,364 --> 02:10:12,670
WILL: Okay, so I'm a 16.

1744
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:18,912
MATT: 16? All right, so Kash is up first. Five to
ten?

1745
02:10:18,912 --> 02:10:19,767
TRAVIS: Ten.

1746
02:10:19,767 --> 02:10:21,338
MARISHA: Oh, I have 14.

1747
02:10:21,338 --> 02:10:22,077
MATT: 14.

1748
02:10:22,077 --> 02:10:23,766
MARY: Ten!

1749
02:10:23,766 --> 02:10:29,823
MATT: Grog and Zahra, who has the higher dexterity
between the two of you?

1750
02:10:29,823 --> 02:10:31,979
MARY: Plus one.

1751
02:10:31,979 --> 02:10:33,165
TRAVIS: Probably not me. 15?

1752
02:10:33,165 --> 02:10:35,785
MARY: Oh, dexterity? Ten.

1753
02:10:35,785 --> 02:10:44,760
MATT: All right, I'll say Grog is going slightly
faster than Zahra. All right. Based on that, Kash!

1754
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,324
You're up first. What do you want to do?

1755
02:10:46,324 --> 02:10:48,148
WILL: I want to get my papers I'm already losing!

1756
02:10:48,148 --> 02:10:57,965
MATT: You're right over here.

1757
02:10:57,965 --> 02:11:06,106
WILL: Yeah, I know. Yeah, I want to move closer to
Grog, I guess.

1758
02:11:06,106 --> 02:11:09,267
MATT: Okay. You can grab your mini.

1759
02:11:09,267 --> 02:11:11,356
WILL: Now how far can we move, here?

1760
02:11:11,356 --> 02:11:14,855
MATT: Well, your speed is, I believe, 30, so you
can move six square spaces.

1761
02:11:14,855 --> 02:11:17,596
WILL: Maybe that's not the best plan.

1762
02:11:17,596 --> 02:11:19,366
MATT: Whatever you want to do, buddy.

1763
02:11:19,366 --> 02:11:27,114
WILL: If I can stay away from him, the better. You
know what? I'm actually going to make my way

1764
02:11:27,114 --> 02:11:32,772
around here. So, six squares? I'm going to get
right here and I want to check out the room and

1765
02:11:32,772 --> 02:11:36,512
the giant pit, which I am now apparently in front
of.

1766
02:11:36,512 --> 02:11:38,467
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make a perception
check.

1767
02:11:38,467 --> 02:11:40,237
WILL: That's the d20?

1768
02:11:40,237 --> 02:11:41,870
MATT: Yep, d20 and add your perception skill.

1769
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:51,892
WILL: That is a seven and, where's perception?
Plus four. But it has advantage.

1770
02:11:51,892 --> 02:11:54,066
MATT: Okay, so roll again.

1771
02:11:54,066 --> 02:11:57,929
WILL: Now it's two. Four. So great.

1772
02:11:57,929 --> 02:12:02,128
MATT: Okay, so you look down. What little bit of
light is making it down, you can see, vaguely, the

1773
02:12:02,128 --> 02:12:07,729
bottom of the pit. About 15 feet down, ten to 15
feet, so it's not a huge drop. You do see there is

1774
02:12:07,729 --> 02:12:12,285
texture to it, meaning it's not a flat surface.
There is something down there that probably, at

1775
02:12:12,285 --> 02:12:19,189
least it doesn't look like it would happily accept
your body plummeting into it.

1776
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:24,927
WILL: Ah, it is not feathers. I'm sensing that's
going to come back to suck at some point.

1777
02:12:24,927 --> 02:12:28,674
MATT: All right, is there anything else you want
to do for your turn?

1778
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:30,247
WILL: No, I'm good for now.

1779
02:12:30,247 --> 02:12:31,612
MATT: Okay.

1780
02:12:31,612 --> 02:12:45,570
MARISHA: Going to get straight into this, I guess.
I am going to cast Call Lightning at 5th level.

1781
02:12:45,570 --> 02:12:53,858
MATT: Call Lightning at 5th level? Okay. You guys
all of a sudden feel the hair on your body and

1782
02:12:53,858 --> 02:13:00,039
your beard drift up, almost like gravity suddenly
has no impact on the moment, as the smell of

1783
02:13:00,039 --> 02:13:07,172
crispy ozone hits the air. Above you, you can see
clouds gather out of what was once a blue sky. You

1784
02:13:07,172 --> 02:13:08,666
hear in the distance the rumble of thunder.

1785
02:13:08,666 --> 02:13:11,610
TRAVIS: Looks like rain!

1786
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:17,620
WILL: I'm not dressed right for this. Look at the
size of her breasts.

1787
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:20,497
MARY: Use them as a shield, Kash!

1788
02:13:20,497 --> 02:13:28,705
MARISHA: Then I say, I'm really sorry about this,
you guys! I think this is an alternate reality,

1789
02:13:28,705 --> 02:13:39,220
though, and we'll be fine if we just get out of
this! I can go ahead and bring down a spell,

1790
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:43,584
right? Or no, yeah, I can the same time.

1791
02:13:43,584 --> 02:13:44,812
MATT: Yes you can.

1792
02:13:44,812 --> 02:13:49,481
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and hit Kashaw
because I can see him through my little window.

1793
02:13:49,481 --> 02:13:50,814
WILL: Suck.

1794
02:13:50,814 --> 02:13:54,485
MATT: All right.

1795
02:13:54,485 --> 02:14:04,792
MARISHA: I get 5d10, right?

1796
02:14:04,792 --> 02:14:08,337
MATT: Yeah, 5d10 points of lightning damage. I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

1797
02:14:08,337 --> 02:14:12,093
WILL: That's a d20 again? Four.

1798
02:14:12,093 --> 02:14:13,948
MATT: Plus your dexterity?

1799
02:14:13,948 --> 02:14:16,468
WILL: Three.

1800
02:14:16,468 --> 02:14:20,737
MATT: All right, I'm going to say that's a fail.
So you take full damage from Keyleth, at this

1801
02:14:20,737 --> 02:14:22,070
point.

1802
02:14:22,070 --> 02:14:23,349
WILL: And it's how much?

1803
02:14:23,349 --> 02:14:24,733
MARISHA: Sorry, Kash! 5d10.

1804
02:14:24,733 --> 02:14:26,473
WILL: Never should have kissed you.

1805
02:14:26,473 --> 02:14:30,073
MATT: That's a terrible roll. You're lucky.

1806
02:14:30,073 --> 02:14:40,886
MARISHA: That is a really terrible roll. 17, and
another one.

1807
02:14:40,886 --> 02:14:45,827
MATT: 18. You take 18 points of lightning damage
as a bolt of energy slams out of the sky like an

1808
02:14:45,827 --> 02:14:50,210
elemental hammer, hitting you and causing you to
hold yourself against the wall, directly to the

1809
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:51,422
back.

1810
02:14:51,422 --> 02:14:54,629
MARISHA: And then I take my bonus action to turn
into an eagle.

1811
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:56,449
MATT: Okay.

1812
02:14:56,449 --> 02:14:58,355
MARISHA: (eagle sounds)

1813
02:14:58,355 --> 02:15:03,690
WILL: I tried to check out the room a little bit,
first, see what was up.

1814
02:15:03,690 --> 02:15:06,787
MARISHA: Fuck that shit! Shit's getting real!

1815
02:15:06,787 --> 02:15:13,439
MATT: So a giant eagle, or just an eagle?

1816
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:15,039
MARISHA: Giant eagle.

1817
02:15:15,039 --> 02:15:21,442
MATT: All right, since I don't have your polymorph
figures with me--

1818
02:15:21,442 --> 02:17:39,895
[no audio until 2:17:40]

1819
02:17:39,895 --> 02:17:46,595
(Matt scatting)

1820
02:17:46,595 --> 02:17:48,972
WILL: Do I have to tell you my 7th-level spell
eventually?

1821
02:17:48,972 --> 02:17:50,738
MATT: Whenever you want to use it.

1822
02:17:50,738 --> 02:17:52,350
MARY: Ooh, surprises.

1823
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:55,377
WILL: I'm using a 7th-level Run Away spell.

1824
02:17:55,377 --> 02:17:57,980
MARY: Run away! That's my favorite.

1825
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:01,497
OFF-SCREEN: They can hear you right now, but now
they can't see you. We're working on it.

1826
02:18:01,497 --> 02:18:03,170
MATT: But now they can hear us?

1827
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:06,584
MARY: Kash, put your pants back on! Oh no!

1828
02:18:06,584 --> 02:18:11,238
TRAVIS: Is that a beholder coming out of the pit?

1829
02:18:11,238 --> 02:18:14,809
MARY: No, no, not a beholder! Don't eat Grog!

1830
02:18:14,809 --> 02:18:18,309
OFF-SCREEN: Program glitch. You're doing great.

1831
02:18:18,309 --> 02:18:24,376
[no audio]

1832
02:18:24,376 --> 02:18:26,306
OFF-SCREEN: They can hear you. They can't see
you.

1833
02:18:26,306 --> 02:18:27,368
MATT: Okay.

1834
02:18:27,368 --> 02:18:29,231
MARY: They can see Grog, but they can't hear
Matt.

1835
02:18:29,231 --> 02:18:31,589
WILL: Now they can't hear or see either of you,
but they can smell you all.

1836
02:18:31,589 --> 02:18:35,583
MATT: For those who were paying attention,
Keyleth, after casting her 5th-level Call

1837
02:18:35,583 --> 02:18:40,045
Lightning, turned into a giant eagle and then flew
80 feet up into the pit.

1838
02:18:40,045 --> 02:18:41,636
MARISHA: Fly away!

1839
02:18:41,636 --> 02:18:43,807
TRAVIS: Can you move diagonal squares?

1840
02:18:43,807 --> 02:18:57,222
MATT: Yeah you can. This is getting interesting.
Well, in the meantime, we shall see if we can get

1841
02:18:57,222 --> 02:19:03,411
this to work. RIP, sound? Oh no!

1842
02:19:03,411 --> 02:19:10,028
TRAVIS: One plus one, plus two, plus one.

1843
02:19:10,028 --> 02:19:20,632
WILL: Can I ask a question? While she is an eagle,
is she considered a creature now? Can she be taken

1844
02:19:20,632 --> 02:19:22,749
control of, if she's an animal?

1845
02:19:22,749 --> 02:19:27,407
MATT: That's a good question.

1846
02:19:27,407 --> 02:19:29,405
MARY: Because you use Polymorph, right?

1847
02:19:29,405 --> 02:19:30,901
MARISHA: Beast shape.

1848
02:19:30,901 --> 02:19:32,717
WILL: Could you use Geas on her?

1849
02:19:32,717 --> 02:19:35,281
MARISHA: I keep all of my mental stats.

1850
02:19:35,281 --> 02:19:37,083
MATT: Oh, a creature? Anybody's a creature.

1851
02:19:37,083 --> 02:19:38,456
WILL: Okay.

1852
02:19:38,456 --> 02:19:41,672
MATT: Any entity is a creature, whether it be a
monster or a person.

1853
02:19:41,672 --> 02:19:43,705
TRAVIS: It says we can see the board, but not you
guys?

1854
02:19:43,705 --> 02:19:48,420
OFF-SCREEN: Yeah, they can see the top-down right
now, but the shot right here doesn't have audio

1855
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,455
for some reason. We're fixing that.

1856
02:19:50,455 --> 02:19:54,769
MATT: Can they still hear us and see the top down?
Okay, well then never mind! Let's get this

1857
02:19:54,769 --> 02:19:59,086
running! We'll stick with this. All right, that
ends Keyleth's turn. Grog?

1858
02:19:59,086 --> 02:20:14,840
TRAVIS: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. I
would like to move ten spaces. Right there.

1859
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:21,658
MATT: All right. As a note, if you are raging and
you don't take damage or deal damage, you lose

1860
02:20:21,658 --> 02:20:23,263
your rage.

1861
02:20:23,263 --> 02:20:26,538
TRAVIS: Oh. So, should I maybe move first and then
rage?

1862
02:20:26,538 --> 02:20:30,774
MATT: Or not rage, if you're not going to do
anything.

1863
02:20:30,774 --> 02:20:36,531
TRAVIS: Oh. I'm very calm as I run from this spot
to here, preparing to rage.

1864
02:20:36,531 --> 02:20:38,409
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

1865
02:20:38,409 --> 02:20:42,375
TRAVIS: Shit, I don't think I ever knew that. You
learn something every day.

1866
02:20:42,375 --> 02:20:46,169
MATT: Yeah, if you fail to hit something or get
hit, which happens very rarely for you anyway, the

1867
02:20:46,169 --> 02:20:49,235
rage drops. Something to remember.

1868
02:20:49,235 --> 02:20:55,330
TRAVIS: Hit a little kid in the area if I have to
attack something. C'mere, boom!

1869
02:20:55,330 --> 02:21:03,063
MATT: All righty, so, if that's ending your turn,
Zahra, you're up. You see the eagle of Keyleth

1870
02:21:03,063 --> 02:21:05,866
take up after calling a bolt down from the
heavens.

1871
02:21:05,866 --> 02:21:07,985
MARY: You're beautiful, darling!

1872
02:21:07,985 --> 02:21:09,607
WILL: Good, now kill her!

1873
02:21:09,607 --> 02:21:21,536
MARY: All right. I would like to cast, because she
is within range of 120 feet, I'm going to do the

1874
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:30,133
combo of Eldritch Blast, a cantrip, plus an
invocation of Agonizing Blast.

1875
02:21:30,133 --> 02:21:36,355
MATT: All right, so the invocation goes on that.
Are you casting that first?

1876
02:21:36,355 --> 02:21:39,347
MARY: Pardon me?

1877
02:21:39,347 --> 02:21:43,472
MATT: Meaning, the eldritch invocation just
happens on top of the Eldritch Blast. Did you have

1878
02:21:43,472 --> 02:21:46,572
another spell or bonus ability you wanted to do
beforehand, or not?

1879
02:21:46,572 --> 02:21:49,413
MARY: No, I think I'm going to save it, because I
realize that casting Hex actually takes up one of

1880
02:21:49,413 --> 02:21:51,122
my spell slots, does it not?

1881
02:21:51,122 --> 02:21:53,791
MATT: Yes, but you can always move it to different
targets if one falls.

1882
02:21:53,791 --> 02:21:55,028
MARY: Yes, I know.

1883
02:21:55,028 --> 02:21:59,191
MATT: Okay, good to know. All right, so, Eldritch
Blast firing against, all three against--?

1884
02:21:59,191 --> 02:22:01,154
MARY: All three against Kiki.

1885
02:22:01,154 --> 02:22:02,800
MATT: All right, what's the range on Eldritch
Blast?

1886
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,153
MARY: 120 feet.

1887
02:22:04,153 --> 02:22:07,112
MATT: Yeah, she's definitely in range. All right,
what's the AC of your eagle?

1888
02:22:07,112 --> 02:22:15,625
MARISHA: 13.

1889
02:22:15,625 --> 02:22:17,845
MATT: 13, all right. Go ahead and roll three
d20s.

1890
02:22:17,845 --> 02:22:20,316
MARY: All right, do I get a spell attack bonus?

1891
02:22:20,316 --> 02:22:25,548
MATT: You do, plus 12. So don't roll a one. Roll
three times.

1892
02:22:25,548 --> 02:22:28,104
MARY: Roll three of the d20s?

1893
02:22:28,104 --> 02:22:41,081
MATT: That's a hit. That's a hit, and third one?
19, that's a hit. Go ahead and roll three d10s and

1894
02:22:41,081 --> 02:22:50,102
it's plus seven to each of them. There you go. So
17 points of damage.

1895
02:22:50,102 --> 02:22:52,188
WILL: Hurts, doesn't it?

1896
02:22:52,188 --> 02:22:54,789
MARY: 17, plus--

1897
02:22:54,789 --> 02:23:03,869
[intermittent audio]

1898
02:23:03,869 --> 02:23:06,441
MATT: --13, so 33. A total of 33 points of
damage.

1899
02:23:06,441 --> 02:23:13,390
MARISHA: Okay, well, that brings me, zero to my...
33 so that's nine points.

1900
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,927
MATT: Did you drop form now?

1901
02:23:15,927 --> 02:23:17,209
MARISHA: Yeah.

1902
02:23:17,209 --> 02:23:23,072
MATT: Okay. First off, make a concentration check
for each one of those hits. It's a constitution

1903
02:23:23,072 --> 02:23:24,505
save.

1904
02:23:24,505 --> 02:23:33,977
MARISHA: I have a ring. So 14?

1905
02:23:33,977 --> 02:23:37,285
MATT: 14. Roll again? So you have to beat ten on
each one.

1906
02:23:37,285 --> 02:23:40,140
MARISHA: Ooh, no. Eight.

1907
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:44,737
MATT: Eight? So as you're hit with the first
agonizing blast, it slams into your form and you

1908
02:23:44,737 --> 02:23:49,399
keep yourself in the air. The second one hits you
again. This time, the clouds disperse as your

1909
02:23:49,399 --> 02:23:56,123
concentration is wrecked from the blast. The third
one finally hits you, losing your form. You

1910
02:23:56,123 --> 02:23:59,900
transform back into a druid and immediately
plummet 80 feet to the ground.

1911
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:05,573
WILL: And you don't have the big breasts to block
you, like I do!

1912
02:24:05,573 --> 02:24:15,553
MATT: So that's 8d6 falling damage.

1913
02:24:15,553 --> 02:24:16,917
OFF-SCREEN: We're back!

1914
02:24:16,917 --> 02:24:26,456
MATT: We're back? All right! Hold on. You take 28
points of fall damage as you fall down into the

1915
02:24:26,456 --> 02:24:30,745
pit, smack! Slamming into the stone ground. Your
bell is rung for a moment as your eyes have a hard

1916
02:24:30,745 --> 02:24:36,466
time focusing around you. You can feel the blood
beginning to pour down the side of your head from

1917
02:24:36,466 --> 02:24:38,866
the impact of slamming into the stonework.

1918
02:24:38,866 --> 02:24:41,469
MARISHA: Oh, bad idea. Okay.

1919
02:24:41,469 --> 02:24:47,357
MARY: Just a warning, don't hurt Kash! Just a
warning! Don't hurt him!

1920
02:24:47,357 --> 02:24:50,372
MATT: All right, Zahra, anything else you want to
do with your turn? Stay there?

1921
02:24:50,372 --> 02:24:52,080
MARY: No, I think I'm fine.

1922
02:24:52,080 --> 02:25:00,788
MATT: Kash, you're up. I'd say, actually, Keyleth,
you are prone on the ground because you fell that

1923
02:25:00,788 --> 02:25:02,090
height.

1924
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:03,547
WILL: Can I see her, or no?

1925
02:25:03,547 --> 02:25:05,776
MATT: Yeah, you can see her, barely, around the
side.

1926
02:25:05,776 --> 02:25:14,096
WILL: I don't like Grog right behind me. That kind
of scares me a little bit.

1927
02:25:14,096 --> 02:25:16,744
TRAVIS: But I'm so stealthy!

1928
02:25:16,744 --> 02:25:30,935
WILL: Maybe he doesn't see me! I'm going to give
myself a little protection here and I'm going to

1929
02:25:30,935 --> 02:25:36,377
cast a 4th-level Guardian of Faith.

1930
02:25:36,377 --> 02:25:37,858
MATT: Okay.

1931
02:25:37,858 --> 02:25:43,066
WILL: I'm going to get a little help in an area
here, if I can.

1932
02:25:43,066 --> 02:25:47,412
MATT: Certainly. 4th-level Guardian of Faith.

1933
02:25:47,412 --> 02:25:53,902
WILL: And apparently the range is 30 feet and it
lasts eight hours. So if I hang near him,

1934
02:25:53,902 --> 02:25:55,792
hopefully that'll be helpful.

1935
02:25:55,792 --> 02:25:59,049
MATT: So any creature hostile to you that moves to
a space within ten feet of the guardian for the

1936
02:25:59,049 --> 02:26:05,466
first time on your turn has to succeed or take
damage. All right. So you choose an unoccupied

1937
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:11,046
space within range and it occupies that space. So
where do you want it to remain?

1938
02:26:11,046 --> 02:26:14,884
WILL: Can I move first and then cast it?

1939
02:26:14,884 --> 02:26:16,376
MATT: Yeah, if you wanted to.

1940
02:26:16,376 --> 02:26:25,841
WILL: All right, I'd like to move back to kind of
where Grog was. So I'm going to go (counting) so I

1941
02:26:25,841 --> 02:26:32,300
end up about here. I'd like to cast the Guardian
of Faith right here, in front of this little

1942
02:26:32,300 --> 02:26:33,407
window.

1943
02:26:33,407 --> 02:26:37,269
MATT: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and use this
piece of popcorn here as the guardian.

1944
02:26:37,269 --> 02:26:42,061
WILL: He guards me and is wonderfully crunchy!

1945
02:26:42,061 --> 02:26:44,212
MARY: He smells so good!

1946
02:26:44,212 --> 02:26:54,168
WILL: That's my, yeah, so for right now I'm good
and I feel a little bit protected.

1947
02:26:54,168 --> 02:26:55,926
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

1948
02:26:55,926 --> 02:26:59,638
MARISHA: Oh, me again? Already? Oh my god. Okay,
well, I stand up.

1949
02:26:59,638 --> 02:27:02,416
MATT: Uses half your movement.

1950
02:27:02,416 --> 02:27:11,067
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and throw a Call
Lightning up again, this time at 4th level.

1951
02:27:11,067 --> 02:27:14,671
MATT: Okay, the clouds re-form.

1952
02:27:14,671 --> 02:27:18,443
TRAVIS: What the shit. This is like Seattle.

1953
02:27:18,443 --> 02:27:21,447
WILL: Rain again? What, are we in London?

1954
02:27:21,447 --> 02:27:27,391
MARISHA: I think I've got a bit of a view on Grog,
kind of know where he is?

1955
02:27:27,391 --> 02:27:31,163
MATT: Ah, barely.

1956
02:27:31,163 --> 02:27:38,781
MARISHA: I can see Kash, though, right? Sorry,
Kash! (lightning crash) Right on Kash again.

1957
02:27:38,781 --> 02:27:41,228
MATT: All right, I need you to make another
dexterity saving throw.

1958
02:27:41,228 --> 02:27:51,073
WILL: And that's the 20 again, right? Come on,
come on. Eight, plus what? Dexterity? Plus two,

1959
02:27:51,073 --> 02:27:52,281
ten.

1960
02:27:52,281 --> 02:27:57,560
MATT: Plus your save, which would be more. Yeah,
you still failed. So 4d10 lightning damage to

1961
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:08,356
Kashaw. That's better. 29 points of lightning
damage as another bolt streaks down, slamming into

1962
02:28:08,356 --> 02:28:09,958
the ground.

1963
02:28:09,958 --> 02:28:17,011
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action to do a
Cure Wounds, or sorry, Healing Word at myself,

1964
02:28:17,011 --> 02:28:18,793
just at first level.

1965
02:28:18,793 --> 02:28:27,416
WILL: Okay, so I take 29 points of damage, is that
what you said? Eesh. 61 already.

1966
02:28:27,416 --> 02:28:32,805
MATT: All right. Keyleth? That's Keyleth's turn.
Grog, you're up.

1967
02:28:32,805 --> 02:28:44,030
TRAVIS: I would like to perform a little community
outreach and I would like to run. Frenzied Rage!

1968
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:46,922
MATT: That's your bonus action, okay.

1969
02:28:46,922 --> 02:28:51,948
MARISHA: This is the shit of nightmares. I want
you to know that.

1970
02:28:51,948 --> 02:28:55,012
TRAVIS: I would like to look at Keyleth and go,
Hi! And attack.

1971
02:28:55,012 --> 02:29:01,855
MATT: This blur of grey and black comes streaking
around the corner as you see the foam frothing

1972
02:29:01,855 --> 02:29:06,312
from Grog's mouth, running toward you, Craven Edge
out of its scabbard.

1973
02:29:06,312 --> 02:29:08,010
MARISHA: Keyleth friend! Keyleth friend!

1974
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:09,654
TRAVIS: 26?

1975
02:29:09,654 --> 02:29:11,449
MATT: Hits.

1976
02:29:11,449 --> 02:29:12,598
TRAVIS: 14?

1977
02:29:12,598 --> 02:29:14,608
MATT: 14 misses.

1978
02:29:14,608 --> 02:29:16,792
TRAVIS: 24.

1979
02:29:16,792 --> 02:29:18,174
MARISHA: Hits.

1980
02:29:18,174 --> 02:29:28,005
TRAVIS: 21.

1981
02:29:28,005 --> 02:29:30,147
MATT: 21 points of slashing damage.

1982
02:29:30,147 --> 02:29:34,405
TRAVIS: It was the third one that hit. 18.

1983
02:29:34,405 --> 02:29:36,842
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage.

1984
02:29:36,842 --> 02:29:39,096
TRAVIS: And she needs to make a constitution
check.

1985
02:29:39,096 --> 02:29:39,922
MATT: Two of them.

1986
02:29:39,922 --> 02:29:46,599
MARISHA: 18 would bring me to 40. Right?

1987
02:29:46,599 --> 02:29:50,462
MATT: 40. All right, so roll two constitution
saving throws.

1988
02:29:50,462 --> 02:29:55,097
MARISHA: Ooh!

1989
02:29:55,097 --> 02:30:02,041
MATT: Succeeds with both! 18 and 16! You hear the
voice creeping in your face go, "Come on, take her

1990
02:30:02,041 --> 02:30:04,537
"life! Give me her strength!"

1991
02:30:04,537 --> 02:30:09,186
TRAVIS: Well I'm working on it! Shit, relax a
little!

1992
02:30:09,186 --> 02:30:13,402
WILL: I love the fact, I'm sorry, I have to point
out that we're being guided by Mumm-ra. Which is

1993
02:30:13,402 --> 02:30:17,742
kind of awesome, I'm sorry.

1994
02:30:17,742 --> 02:30:24,159
MATT: Ancient spirits of evil. All right, so, that
ends your turn Grog. Zahra, you're up.

1995
02:30:24,190 --> 02:30:29,991
MARY: Can I move first so I can get Kiki and, so
sorry, my darling--

1996
02:30:29,991 --> 02:30:31,802
MATT: Where are you going?

1997
02:30:31,802 --> 02:30:34,322
MARY: I'm going to go toward Keyleth so I can get
her in sight.

1998
02:30:34,322 --> 02:30:37,878
MATT: You can see her there.

1999
02:30:37,878 --> 02:30:42,510
MARY: All right. I'm going to cast--

2000
02:30:42,510 --> 02:30:43,892
TRAVIS: Just do it!

2001
02:30:43,892 --> 02:30:46,870
MARY: Finger of Death.

2002
02:30:46,870 --> 02:30:49,645
TRAVIS: (shrieks) Does she have that?!

2003
02:30:49,645 --> 02:30:51,917
MATT: She does now!

2004
02:30:51,917 --> 02:30:54,782
WILL: Oh shit! Don't look at me!

2005
02:30:54,782 --> 02:30:58,961
MARY: I look like Percy, so No Mercy Percy.

2006
02:30:58,961 --> 02:31:02,557
TRAVIS: Do you have to roll for it?

2007
02:31:02,557 --> 02:31:07,748
MATT: Hold on, hold on. Okay.

2008
02:31:07,748 --> 02:31:11,461
TRAVIS: Well fuck the foreplay, let's get on with
it.

2009
02:31:11,461 --> 02:31:17,262
MATT: Constitution saving throw. It is a spell, so
you would have advantage on the roll for your

2010
02:31:17,262 --> 02:31:18,866
armor.

2011
02:31:18,866 --> 02:31:26,572
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! That's good. 17, that's
good for the first one. And a natural one! So I'll

2012
02:31:26,572 --> 02:31:27,991
take the 17.

2013
02:31:27,991 --> 02:31:33,355
MATT: All right, plus three? So you make the save.
You take half damage. Go ahead and roll 7d8 plus

2014
02:31:33,355 --> 02:31:34,377
30.

2015
02:31:34,377 --> 02:31:37,023
WILL: 7d8 plus 30! What?!

2016
02:31:37,023 --> 02:31:38,462
TRAVIS: You have that?

2017
02:31:38,462 --> 02:31:47,327
MARY: Just today. I don't know, I woke up! I may
need your help.

2018
02:31:47,327 --> 02:31:49,840
MATT: Chat room: "Well, that escalated quickly."

2019
02:31:49,840 --> 02:32:10,382
TRAVIS: 16? You're having <i>me</i> help you with math.
That's four. One more.

2020
02:32:10,382 --> 02:32:13,798
MARY: Grog and Zahra do math.

2021
02:32:13,798 --> 02:32:16,839
MATT: So you take 30 points of necrotic damage.

2022
02:32:16,839 --> 02:32:18,742
MARY: Plus 30? Oh yeah, that was 60.

2023
02:32:18,742 --> 02:32:24,657
MATT: Yep, 60, and half that. So you take 30 and
you're still up, at ten hit points, as a beam of

2024
02:32:24,657 --> 02:32:31,506
greenish necrotic death streaks across this
battlefield, slamming into your side unexpectedly

2025
02:32:31,506 --> 02:32:35,937
from behind as you're staring up at the horrible
form of Grog raging in front of you. You feel most

2026
02:32:35,937 --> 02:32:40,413
of your vitality sucked out of your body
immediately. You glance over your shoulder and see

2027
02:32:40,413 --> 02:32:42,466
Zahra around the corner going--

2028
02:32:42,466 --> 02:32:49,401
MARY: Slightly possessive of Kash, sorry! I'm so
sorry! You're too beautiful!

2029
02:32:49,401 --> 02:32:56,945
MATT: All right, Kash, you're up. Unless you
wanted to move still.

2030
02:32:56,945 --> 02:32:59,230
MARY: No, I'll stay there.

2031
02:32:59,230 --> 02:33:09,171
WILL: I think, wait, I have to see how close I can
get. I'd like to move first. My guardian is going

2032
02:33:09,171 --> 02:33:22,632
to stay there. I could stay there and ride it out,
let them fight it out. Seriously. Scanlan's

2033
02:33:22,632 --> 02:33:39,583
tactics. I'm going to move closer to the battle
here. So I'm going to go (counting). Wait, wait.

2034
02:33:39,583 --> 02:33:41,063
Hang on.

2035
02:33:41,063 --> 02:33:43,713
TRAVIS: Oh, into the pit! You die!

2036
02:33:43,713 --> 02:33:48,515
WILL: I guess it doesn't matter where I go, I'm
still not going to be able to see her, am I?

2037
02:33:48,515 --> 02:33:51,814
TRAVIS: There's a window. Is there a window, Matt,
or is it supposed to be a wall?

2038
02:33:51,814 --> 02:33:53,915
MATT: It's a window.

2039
02:33:53,915 --> 02:34:01,906
TRAVIS: Through the window, to the wall! To the
sweat drops down dragons' balls!

2040
02:34:01,906 --> 02:34:04,011
WILL: So can I see her?

2041
02:34:04,011 --> 02:34:09,474
MATT: Just so you're aware, that didn't use a
spell slot. No, because it's part of the mystic

2042
02:34:09,474 --> 02:34:13,366
arcanum ability. You get to use that once without
spending a spell slot.

2043
02:34:13,366 --> 02:34:27,324
WILL: Wow, that's a good spell. So can I actually
see her, then, through said window?

2044
02:34:27,324 --> 02:34:35,548
MATT: Keyleth? You could, yes. But she would have
three-quarters cover. If it has a spell attack

2045
02:34:35,548 --> 02:34:38,381
roll, she would get a bonus to armor class.

2046
02:34:38,381 --> 02:34:49,485
WILL: I'm still going to try to give her, if I can
see her from there, a 5th-level Flame Strike.

2047
02:34:49,485 --> 02:34:56,362
Okay, so that's what I'm going to do.

2048
02:34:56,362 --> 02:34:58,008
MATT: Okay.

2049
02:34:58,008 --> 02:35:03,827
WILL: She came out swinging! I was like, hey,
let's check it out!

2050
02:35:03,827 --> 02:35:09,852
TRAVIS: I was coming over to say hi and then it
was like, (explosions)!

2051
02:35:09,852 --> 02:35:18,893
MARY: You totally frizzed my hair with that
fucking lightning, so. Bad hair day is all Zahra

2052
02:35:18,893 --> 02:35:20,243
needs.

2053
02:35:20,243 --> 02:35:31,345
MATT: It's a ten-foot radius, so you're getting
this area? So I need both of you guys, Grog and

2054
02:35:31,345 --> 02:35:33,710
Keyleth, to make a dexterity saving throw.

2055
02:35:33,710 --> 02:35:35,801
MARISHA: Dexterity save?

2056
02:35:35,801 --> 02:35:37,934
MATT: Yes.

2057
02:35:37,934 --> 02:35:41,173
MARISHA: Nine plus--

2058
02:35:41,173 --> 02:35:43,708
MATT: You have advantage because spells.

2059
02:35:43,708 --> 02:35:49,329
MARISHA: So excited! Ooh, that's much better. 20
total.

2060
02:35:49,329 --> 02:35:52,140
MATT: 20? That would do it, so you take half
damage from this.

2061
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:53,554
TRAVIS: 15.

2062
02:35:53,554 --> 02:35:56,043
MATT: I believe your DC is 18, so no.

2063
02:35:56,043 --> 02:35:58,418
MARISHA: What are you hitting me? Oh, you're
firestorming us?

2064
02:35:58,418 --> 02:36:02,972
MATT: Flame Strike. So roll 8d6, because it's half
fire and half radiant damage.

2065
02:36:02,972 --> 02:36:10,978
WILL: 8d6? Is this the six? Yeah, where is it? I
don't have-- yes I do. So eight. You mind if I

2066
02:36:10,978 --> 02:36:14,935
borrow these?

2067
02:36:14,935 --> 02:36:19,194
MARISHA: What does the cover grant you? What's the
three-quarters cover do?

2068
02:36:19,194 --> 02:36:22,949
MATT: It helps give you a better armor class, but
it doesn't help you against radial spells.

2069
02:36:22,949 --> 02:36:33,781
WILL: Come on, daddy needs to cook a druid. Here
we go. (counting) If it's on critical role? All

2070
02:36:33,781 --> 02:36:46,067
right, so there's 16... 30.

2071
02:36:46,067 --> 02:36:48,391
MATT: 30. You roll two more.

2072
02:36:48,391 --> 02:36:50,411
WILL: I roll two more, sorry!

2073
02:36:50,411 --> 02:37:02,527
MATT: So there's an incredible roll. 39. So, 18
points of damage. You take 39 points of fire.

2074
02:37:02,527 --> 02:37:07,971
Keyleth is now currently unconscious right there.

2075
02:37:07,971 --> 02:37:10,668
WILL: Try fighting now!

2076
02:37:10,668 --> 02:37:13,600
MARY: First kiss my ass!

2077
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,800
MARISHA: Anything I can do to fix myself while I'm
out?

2078
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:20,811
MATT: No, you keep making death saves until
hopefully you'd roll a 20 and maybe stabilize.

2079
02:37:20,811 --> 02:37:28,159
Well, if you roll a 20 you, fuck. I have to
remember the roll. You come back to consciousness

2080
02:37:28,159 --> 02:37:29,932
with one hit point.

2081
02:37:29,932 --> 02:37:35,310
MARISHA: But I have to roll a nat 20. Other than
that, that's it? Oh man.

2082
02:37:35,310 --> 02:37:43,672
WILL: You started with Lightning Striking me!
That's not something you forget! Yeah, that's my

2083
02:37:43,672 --> 02:37:45,037
turn.

2084
02:37:45,037 --> 02:37:46,682
MATT: Keyleth, I need you to go ahead and roll a
death save.

2085
02:37:46,682 --> 02:37:48,709
MARISHA: Yeah, totally. Nope.

2086
02:37:48,709 --> 02:37:53,587
MATT: All right, so that's one failed save. Go
ahead and mark that off. Grog, it's your turn.

2087
02:37:53,587 --> 02:37:57,795
TRAVIS: I would ask a question. Is there any way I
can move just up against the wall so that Keyleth

2088
02:37:57,795 --> 02:38:00,599
and Zahra are in a straight line?

2089
02:38:00,599 --> 02:38:04,943
WILL: Oh, that's not a good sound. That's a bad
question.

2090
02:38:04,943 --> 02:38:10,374
MATT: Oh, not really. I mean, depends on what you
want to do. If you're trying to ricochet Keyleth's

2091
02:38:10,374 --> 02:38:11,706
body--

2092
02:38:11,706 --> 02:38:15,384
TRAVIS: No, I have the Javelin of Lightning, but
it only works in a straight line.

2093
02:38:15,384 --> 02:38:18,613
MATT: Yeah, you'd probably have to hit one or the
other.

2094
02:38:18,613 --> 02:38:20,545
MARISHA: I'm also on the ground.

2095
02:38:20,545 --> 02:38:21,873
TRAVIS: I'm going to hit Keyleth on the ground.

2096
02:38:21,873 --> 02:38:23,420
MATT: You're going to hit Keyleth on the ground?

2097
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,945
TRAVIS: Yeah, isn't she down on the ground?

2098
02:38:24,945 --> 02:38:27,631
MATT: Yeah. You can separate your moves and your
attacks. You can hit, then move, then hit.

2099
02:38:27,631 --> 02:38:35,744
TRAVIS: I'll hit her once and then move. I'm going
to pimp slap and run!

2100
02:38:35,744 --> 02:38:40,880
MATT: Okay, because it's a melee attack within
five feet, it's an auto-crit which is an immediate

2101
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:42,689
two death saves. How do you want to do this?

2102
02:38:42,689 --> 02:38:44,853
(yelling)

2103
02:38:44,853 --> 02:38:49,230
MARY: Oh my god! What?

2104
02:38:49,230 --> 02:39:00,379
MARISHA: Come on, come on. All that pent-up
aggression you've been wanting to get out.

2105
02:39:00,379 --> 02:39:06,348
TRAVIS: I pick up Craven Edge over my head. Seeing
her there, unconscious, I turn my head away, turn

2106
02:39:06,348 --> 02:39:08,337
the point down, and go, whack!

2107
02:39:08,337 --> 02:39:18,369
MATT: And with that, you hear an attempt at breath
and a slight gurgle as your eyes are closed as you

2108
02:39:18,369 --> 02:39:28,256
draw the blade. You hear a satisfying, "Yes,
delicious. Two more, Grog."

2109
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:36,142
TRAVIS: I'll do my best. Do I get an extra attack
after I make my move, because I killed someone?

2110
02:39:36,142 --> 02:39:40,777
MATT: Well, you have your bonus action attack
anyway because you have your frenzied rage, so you

2111
02:39:40,777 --> 02:39:43,139
still have your movement and two more attacks.

2112
02:39:43,139 --> 02:39:53,781
TRAVIS: All right, I would like to move to Zahra,
please. I would like to do like Joaquin Phoenix

2113
02:39:53,781 --> 02:40:02,528
and swing away. Yeah, Joaquin Phoenix in Signs?
See, and swing away? Grabs the bat and he beats

2114
02:40:02,528 --> 02:40:08,226
the shit out of the alien? I would also like to do
reckless attack on these.

2115
02:40:08,226 --> 02:40:11,424
MATT: All right, not great weapon master though?

2116
02:40:11,424 --> 02:40:23,243
TRAVIS: No. Reckless. Advantage, and whoever's
fighting me gets advantage. 24 is the first one.

2117
02:40:23,243 --> 02:40:25,254
MARY: Yeah, that hits.

2118
02:40:25,254 --> 02:40:29,671
TRAVIS: 18 is probably going to be good enough. 27
on the second one.

2119
02:40:29,671 --> 02:40:31,450
MATT: Both hit. You only get two attacks on her.

2120
02:40:31,450 --> 02:40:32,522
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

2121
02:40:32,522 --> 02:40:34,305
MATT: Yeah, because you killed Keyleth with one.

2122
02:40:34,305 --> 02:40:43,248
WILL: While she was unconscious! While she was
down and unconscious, awesome.

2123
02:40:43,248 --> 02:40:49,944
TRAVIS: Ten, 18 for the first one.

2124
02:40:49,944 --> 02:40:52,044
MATT: So 18 points of slashing damage.

2125
02:40:52,044 --> 02:40:56,638
TRAVIS: 12. 20 on the second one.

2126
02:40:56,638 --> 02:41:01,318
MATT: So 38 points of slashing damage against you,
Zahra. I need you to make two constitution saving

2127
02:41:01,318 --> 02:41:03,181
throws.

2128
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:07,884
MARISHA: Grog off the leash is a bad day.

2129
02:41:07,884 --> 02:41:12,244
MATT: Yeah man, you guys' best bet was probably to
gang up on Grog, and you guys let him stick

2130
02:41:12,244 --> 02:41:14,223
around. This is going to be rough.

2131
02:41:14,223 --> 02:41:15,387
MARY: What do I need to do?

2132
02:41:15,387 --> 02:41:26,845
MATT: Roll a d20 twice, adding three each roll. So
that's a fail. Second one again? Success. So your

2133
02:41:26,845 --> 02:41:31,218
strength goes down to ten as Craven Edge saps a
strength point from you. You get a plus one to

2134
02:41:31,218 --> 02:41:34,878
your strength, which brings you up to 18, I
believe? So currently you get a plus one to hit

2135
02:41:34,878 --> 02:41:36,312
and damage on all your attacks.

2136
02:41:36,312 --> 02:41:37,903
TRAVIS: A beautiful thing.

2137
02:41:37,903 --> 02:41:40,987
MATT: I believe that's the end of Grog's turn,
because you can't do much else? Zahra, you're up.

2138
02:41:40,987 --> 02:41:44,845
MARY: I would like to tell Grog how much I love
him.

2139
02:41:44,845 --> 02:41:51,090
MATT: Don't forget, as a reaction, before your
turn ends, if you wanted to use your Hellish

2140
02:41:51,090 --> 02:41:52,430
Rebuke?

2141
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:57,181
MARY: I know, but do I want to let it all go now?

2142
02:41:57,181 --> 02:42:06,975
MATT: It's either that or have him cleave your
face off next turn!

2143
02:42:06,975 --> 02:42:10,360
TRAVIS: It's always an option! Face slits are
always in!

2144
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:17,317
MARY: Out of nowhere, a voice comes to me and
says, "Use Hellish Rebuke!" And so, as a reaction,

2145
02:42:17,317 --> 02:42:18,609
I shall.

2146
02:42:18,609 --> 02:42:20,600
MARISHA: Now I'm envisioning Grog's Rhinoplasty.

2147
02:42:20,600 --> 02:42:23,171
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

2148
02:42:23,171 --> 02:42:27,576
TRAVIS: 19.

2149
02:42:27,576 --> 02:42:30,648
MATT: He succeeds, so he takes half the damage.
Roll 2d10.

2150
02:42:30,648 --> 02:42:33,040
WILL: Come on, you can do it, Z.

2151
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:38,086
MARY: 14.

2152
02:42:38,086 --> 02:42:40,735
MATT: So he takes seven points of fire damage to
Grog.

2153
02:42:40,735 --> 02:42:44,107
MARISHA: God, he is made of meat and hit points.

2154
02:42:44,107 --> 02:42:47,279
WILL: Made of meat, hit points, and shame.

2155
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:50,280
MATT: What are you at right now, Grog? He's at 134
hit points, guys.

2156
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:52,225
MARY: Fuck you.

2157
02:42:52,225 --> 02:42:57,051
MATT: Seriously, Grog has rolled some of the best
hit point rolls I've ever seen in my life, and

2158
02:42:57,051 --> 02:43:00,761
then he took the toughness feat. And has a
constitution of 20. It's stupid.

2159
02:43:00,761 --> 02:43:04,016
WILL: So we can't kill-- Dude.

2160
02:43:04,016 --> 02:43:11,899
MARY: I know. Witch Bolt is a concentration, so I
can't Hex him, is that correct?

2161
02:43:11,899 --> 02:43:14,566
MARISHA: Whenever he fails that save on Finger of
Death, that's fucking--

2162
02:43:14,566 --> 02:43:17,378
TRAVIS: Tell me she only has one of those a day,
right?

2163
02:43:17,378 --> 02:43:23,181
MARISHA: One for free, without burning a spell
slot.

2164
02:43:23,181 --> 02:43:30,515
MATT: It's one of those things where, if it's a
concentration spell and you're not using it to

2165
02:43:30,515 --> 02:43:38,096
concentrate, Generally, just a one-off thing, I'll
allow you to concentrate on two things at once if

2166
02:43:38,096 --> 02:43:43,592
you use it as a one-off spell. So I would say, if
you wanted to Hex somebody and then do a Witch

2167
02:43:43,592 --> 02:43:47,438
Bolt but not have the concentration effect, I'd
allow that.

2168
02:43:47,438 --> 02:43:49,343
MARY: I don't know what that means.

2169
02:43:49,343 --> 02:43:55,060
MATT: What that means is, as long as you're not
maintaining Witch Bolt, I'll let it not override

2170
02:43:55,060 --> 02:43:57,218
Hex because you're just doing it as a one-off
spell.

2171
02:43:57,218 --> 02:43:59,492
MARY: Okay, but what if i want to keep it going?

2172
02:43:59,492 --> 02:44:01,939
MATT: Then Hex would not overlap with it.

2173
02:44:01,939 --> 02:44:04,070
MARY: I'm going to Witch Bolt Grog.

2174
02:44:04,070 --> 02:44:17,225
MATT: It is also a ranged spell attack, which
means you have disadvantage to hit him with it

2175
02:44:17,225 --> 02:44:22,485
because he is right in your face. You can step
away from him to try to do it.

2176
02:44:22,485 --> 02:44:26,716
MARY: I'm going to Hex him. If I Eldritch Blast am
I still at disadvantage?

2177
02:44:26,716 --> 02:44:29,337
MATT: Same thing, disadvantage on blasts because
he's right up in your face. You'd have to get away

2178
02:44:29,337 --> 02:44:30,687
from him to do that.

2179
02:44:30,687 --> 02:44:36,829
MARy: All right, I'm going to use my Cloak of the
Bat and fly away from him, but he gets to whack me

2180
02:44:36,829 --> 02:44:47,973
then, doesn't he? All right. Wait, let me, is that
considered an action?

2181
02:44:47,973 --> 02:44:51,000
MATT: Well, it depends on what the ability is.

2182
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,954
MARY: Cloak of the Bat allows me to fly at will.

2183
02:44:54,954 --> 02:44:59,614
MATT: All it does is give you flying? So you don't
turn into a bat form, it means you can just fly?

2184
02:44:59,614 --> 02:45:00,812
So you can do that.

2185
02:45:00,812 --> 02:45:02,818
MARY: And then do I still get to cast something
afterwards?

2186
02:45:02,818 --> 02:45:05,097
MATT: Let me pull up the book real fast.

2187
02:45:05,097 --> 02:45:07,943
WILL: Like a kid at Christmas over there!

2188
02:45:07,943 --> 02:45:12,046
TRAVIS: No, I'm not getting excited about anything
because if Christmas is any indication, shit can go

2189
02:45:12,046 --> 02:45:21,456
south. I got a remote control car! (crashing)
(crying) I got a Nerf football!

2190
02:45:21,456 --> 02:45:39,624
MATT: You can choose to fly 40 feet. It's not
an actual action to use it, so you can do that.

2191
02:45:39,624 --> 02:45:41,708
That'd be your movement.

2192
02:45:41,708 --> 02:45:46,203
MARY: I'd like to do that and cast Evard's Black
Tentacles.

2193
02:45:46,203 --> 02:45:47,757
TRAVIS: What?! Whose?!

2194
02:45:47,757 --> 02:45:49,290
WILL: You'll find out!

2195
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:50,885
MATT: Are you going to cast that first and then
go?

2196
02:45:50,885 --> 02:45:52,726
MARY: No, I need to get out of there before.

2197
02:45:52,726 --> 02:45:54,245
MATT: Okay, so Grog you get a swipe at her.

2198
02:45:54,245 --> 02:45:56,689
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do. Do I get advantage on my
recklessness?

2199
02:45:56,689 --> 02:46:01,292
MATT: Yes. Though technically, he does have
reckless attack on him, so you could attack him

2200
02:46:01,292 --> 02:46:05,215
without disadvantage. I forgot about that. So if
you wanted to hit him with a spell, your

2201
02:46:05,215 --> 02:46:09,439
disadvantage is canceled out by the advantage
you'd have on him because he used reckless

2202
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:10,740
attack.

2203
02:46:10,740 --> 02:46:12,464
MARY: I'm not sure I understand that.

2204
02:46:12,464 --> 02:46:20,057
TRAVIS: You roll once instead of having to roll
twice and take the lower. Because you have

2205
02:46:20,057 --> 02:46:23,174
disadvantage, but I gave you advantage, so they
cancel each other.

2206
02:46:23,174 --> 02:46:25,340
MATT: So it's a regular roll if you wanted to stay
where you are.

2207
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:27,515
MARY: He's still going to cleave my face off next
turn.

2208
02:46:27,515 --> 02:46:31,897
MATT: Yeah, but he won't get a bonus attack of
cleaving. Up to you. If you want to take the hit

2209
02:46:31,897 --> 02:46:33,127
to the face and run away?

2210
02:46:33,127 --> 02:46:34,818
MARY: I'm going to take the hit to the face.

2211
02:46:34,818 --> 02:46:36,633
MATT: All right, make an attack, Grog.

2212
02:46:36,633 --> 02:46:40,975
TRAVIS: 15 was the total of the second roll. I'm
sorry, so that's 24.

2213
02:46:40,975 --> 02:46:43,136
MATT: That hits, roll damage. Where do you want to
fly?

2214
02:46:43,136 --> 02:46:47,249
MARY: I'd like to fly over here.

2215
02:46:47,249 --> 02:46:52,089
TRAVIS: 21.

2216
02:46:52,089 --> 02:46:53,881
MARY: Fuck you.

2217
02:46:53,881 --> 02:46:55,217
MATT: 21 points of damage to you.

2218
02:46:55,217 --> 02:46:56,861
TRAVIS: And a constitution save.

2219
02:46:56,861 --> 02:47:07,155
MARY: Not yet. And I'd like to cast Evard's Black
Tentacles. Would you like to hear the

2220
02:47:07,155 --> 02:47:08,788
description?

2221
02:47:08,788 --> 02:47:10,986
TRAVIS: In explicit details.

2222
02:47:10,986 --> 02:47:16,366
MARY: Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot
square on the ground that I can see within range.

2223
02:47:16,366 --> 02:47:21,142
For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground
in the area into difficult terrain. When a

2224
02:47:21,142 --> 02:47:27,154
creature enters or is affected for the first time,
the creature must succeed a dexterity saving throw

2225
02:47:27,154 --> 02:47:33,242
and take-- it's not too much damage. A creature
that starts its turn in the area is already

2226
02:47:33,242 --> 02:47:34,935
restrained. Basically, you're restrained.

2227
02:47:34,935 --> 02:47:36,684
TRAVIS: I'm restrained, okay.

2228
02:47:36,684 --> 02:47:41,030
MATT: This'll be the markers for the area. This
whole area is filled with dark tentacles.

2229
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:42,434
WILL: And he can't go anywhere.

2230
02:47:42,434 --> 02:47:48,250
MATT: It's difficult terrain, which means every
five feet step you take it costs ten feet of your

2231
02:47:48,250 --> 02:47:49,316
movement.

2232
02:47:49,316 --> 02:47:50,446
TRAVIS: So my speed is halved.

2233
02:47:50,446 --> 02:47:51,470
MATT: Yep.

2234
02:47:51,470 --> 02:47:53,144
TRAVIS: Shit.

2235
02:47:53,144 --> 02:47:56,708
MARY: Do I get anything else?

2236
02:47:56,708 --> 02:48:00,138
MATT: That's your action. If you wanted to use
your bonus action to drink a healing potion?

2237
02:48:00,138 --> 02:48:01,777
MARY: That's what I'd like.

2238
02:48:01,777 --> 02:48:03,104
MATT: Go ahead and do that. You heal 8d4 plus eight.

2239
02:48:03,104 --> 02:48:09,142
TRAVIS: She needs to make a constitution saving
throw.

2240
02:48:09,142 --> 02:48:34,899
MATT: That's right, yeah. So that's 14. Roll two
more. 19 plus eight. So you heal 27 hit points.

2241
02:48:34,899 --> 02:48:40,759
That's the end of your turn. Kash, you're up.
These black tentacles.

2242
02:48:40,759 --> 02:48:43,972
TRAVIS: Come join the party, it's like an anime
nightmare in here.

2243
02:48:43,972 --> 02:48:45,515
(laughter)

2244
02:48:45,515 --> 02:48:49,604
WILL: It's tempting. What's also tempting is my
Guardian of Faith that's still over there waiting

2245
02:48:49,604 --> 02:48:50,705
for me.

2246
02:48:50,705 --> 02:48:51,972
TRAVIS: Orville Redenbacher?

2247
02:48:51,972 --> 02:48:53,852
WILL: Yes! He will protect all. No.

2248
02:48:53,852 --> 02:48:55,577
MARISHA: Orville!

2249
02:48:55,577 --> 02:49:01,480
WILL: I think right now while he is trapped
there--

2250
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:10,953
MATT: That is eight plus three. That is a failure;
you lose another strength point.

2251
02:49:10,953 --> 02:49:12,579
MARY: Can I use luck?

2252
02:49:12,579 --> 02:49:13,414
MATT: If you have luck, yeah!

2253
02:49:13,414 --> 02:49:16,534
MARY: 15.

2254
02:49:16,534 --> 02:49:17,896
MATT: Yeah, never mind! It doesn't happen.

2255
02:49:17,896 --> 02:49:27,864
WILL: It is getting down to the nitty gritty. He
can't move now, which is--

2256
02:49:27,864 --> 02:49:29,987
MATT: That you know of, unless he makes his save.

2257
02:49:29,987 --> 02:49:35,063
WILL: Oh, well that's disappointing. With the way
he's rolling tonight, I'm guessing he'll make the

2258
02:49:35,063 --> 02:49:36,356
save.

2259
02:49:36,356 --> 02:49:41,527
TRAVIS: So I have to make a save to move, or it
just halves my speed?

2260
02:49:41,527 --> 02:49:48,366
MATT: At the start of your turn, you have roll to
see if you're restrained and take damage.

2261
02:49:48,366 --> 02:49:49,977
WILL: I think I got to hit him hard right now
while he's away from there.

2262
02:49:49,977 --> 02:49:52,343
TRAVIS: No! Look, she's right there in the open
world.

2263
02:49:52,343 --> 02:49:55,744
WILL: I think I'm going to use my 7th-level
Firestorm.

2264
02:49:55,744 --> 02:49:57,724
MARISHA: Yeah, you will!

2265
02:49:57,724 --> 02:49:59,851
MATT: Are you using it on both of them?

2266
02:49:59,851 --> 02:50:01,106
MARISHA: Yes, you are.

2267
02:50:01,106 --> 02:50:02,925
TRAVIS: You don't want to do that.

2268
02:50:02,925 --> 02:50:04,571
WILL: Yeah, I think I probably should.

2269
02:50:04,571 --> 02:50:08,164
TRAVIS: Think about all the poor tentacles that
just came to life.

2270
02:50:08,164 --> 02:50:12,699
MATT: That's true. It might knock her
concentration and lose the tentacle spell.

2271
02:50:12,699 --> 02:50:15,559
WILL: I imagine it might lose the tentacle spell,
but again, with the way he's rolling, I imagine

2272
02:50:15,559 --> 02:50:17,573
he's going to make his saving throw.

2273
02:50:17,573 --> 02:50:22,033
MATT: The point is, I guess, from a technical
standpoint, if you just hit him, the tentacles

2274
02:50:22,033 --> 02:50:25,293
will stay up. If you hit both of them, it'll
probably knock her down, but you lose the

2275
02:50:25,293 --> 02:50:27,369
tentacles and he'll be able to come after you next
turn.

2276
02:50:27,369 --> 02:50:31,989
WILL: Okay, then I want to do the one where he'll
go back after her and keep me alive and well,

2277
02:50:31,989 --> 02:50:34,398
which is what I'm guessing is going to happen.

2278
02:50:34,398 --> 02:50:39,028
MATT: It's up to you. You can go after them both
and take her out right now, probably. Your call.

2279
02:50:39,028 --> 02:50:44,742
Whatever you want to do.

2280
02:50:44,742 --> 02:50:46,715
WILL: I don't want to take her out right now,
because then it's just me and Grog. I've got

2281
02:50:46,715 --> 02:50:48,264
nobody who's helping me out.

2282
02:50:48,264 --> 02:50:50,045
TRAVIS: You might not get this chance again. I
mean, we're both right there.

2283
02:50:50,045 --> 02:50:59,044
WILL: How many hit points do you have? 309? How
many are there? 7000 hit points? You're at what?

2284
02:50:59,044 --> 02:51:00,457
TRAVIS: 134.

2285
02:51:00,457 --> 02:51:03,998
WILL: And you're at what? How many do you have
left?

2286
02:51:03,998 --> 02:51:06,986
MARY: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I didn't quite
hear you.

2287
02:51:06,986 --> 02:51:08,579
WILL: "My hit points are so low, I can't hear
anymore."

2288
02:51:08,579 --> 02:51:12,764
MARY: My hearing is gone. Apparently you lose
hearing. 57.

2289
02:51:12,764 --> 02:51:14,512
MATT: She looks hurt.

2290
02:51:14,512 --> 02:51:19,642
WILL: You know what, one thing at a time. I'm
going to go for Grog right now and I want to make

2291
02:51:19,642 --> 02:51:22,422
sure she holds her concentration on the
tentacles.

2292
02:51:22,422 --> 02:51:28,614
TRAVIS: I expected more.

2293
02:51:28,614 --> 02:51:30,414
WILL: You're still going to be like, "Oh my god,
it's the biggest hit I've taken all night! I'm

2294
02:51:30,580 --> 02:51:31,825
"down to 120."

2295
02:51:31,825 --> 02:51:36,354
MATT: As you're currently dealing with all these
dark, arcane tentacles that are sprouting out of

2296
02:51:36,354 --> 02:51:43,842
all the stones around the ground, a beam of light
seems to descend from the sky for a second as it

2297
02:51:43,842 --> 02:51:48,930
turns to a dark red crimson and bursts around you
in a giant inferno of searing divine energy.

2298
02:51:48,930 --> 02:51:55,125
WILL: Hey, how you doing! Boom!

2299
02:51:55,125 --> 02:51:59,458
MATT: It curves around and incinerates the remains
of Keyleth.

2300
02:51:59,458 --> 02:52:03,109
MARY: Bye, Kiki!

2301
02:52:03,109 --> 02:52:05,100
TRAVIS: Sarah Connor style!

2302
02:52:05,100 --> 02:52:09,946
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

2303
02:52:09,946 --> 02:52:20,475
TRAVIS: Oh wow, really? That's 21. It's a 19.
Dexterity saving, right? Yeah. Plus two.

2304
02:52:20,475 --> 02:52:24,929
MATT: So you take half damage from that. Go ahead
and roll 7d10 fire damage.

2305
02:52:24,929 --> 02:52:27,057
TRAVIS: 7d10?!

2306
02:52:27,057 --> 02:52:30,850
MATT: That's what she did to take out the
wyverns.

2307
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:46,626
WILL: Are these d10? No, those are d8. So I got,
these are all d10s here, right? Nine. Does anyone

2308
02:52:46,626 --> 02:52:50,047
have one more? I have six. I need one more. There
we go.

2309
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:54,898
TRAVIS: Why would I give him mine? I see a ten. I
see two tens.

2310
02:52:54,898 --> 02:53:11,602
MATT: 43 points of fire damage. You take half of
that, so 21 points of fire damage.

2311
02:53:11,602 --> 02:53:17,399
WILL: That's like nothing! And then for the rest
of my move, right? I'm going to run back to my

2312
02:53:17,399 --> 02:53:25,393
spiritual guardian and be like, what's up? That
was my 7th-level spell and nothing! We barely

2313
02:53:25,393 --> 02:53:26,687
touched him!

2314
02:53:26,687 --> 02:53:29,231
MATT: Keyleth smolders. Grog, it's your turn.

2315
02:53:29,231 --> 02:53:31,621
TRAVIS: I'd like to try and break free of the
tentacles of love.

2316
02:53:31,621 --> 02:53:35,512
MATT: Go ahead and make your dexterity saving
throw.

2317
02:53:35,512 --> 02:53:39,471
TRAVIS: It's 14.

2318
02:53:39,471 --> 02:53:45,983
MATT: 14 is a failure. You take 3d6 points of
damage. Could you roll that, Zahra?

2319
02:53:45,983 --> 02:53:47,776
WILL: Just keep tagging him, Z!

2320
02:53:47,776 --> 02:53:49,808
MARY: I'm trying, darling. I'm trying.

2321
02:53:49,808 --> 02:53:51,560
TRAVIS: What kind of damage, there, Matthew?

2322
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:59,704
MATT: This is bludgeoning, so you take half the
damage. So he took four points of bludgeoning

2323
02:53:59,704 --> 02:54:07,253
damage and you are restrained currently.
Restrained, to specifically read you what it does,

2324
02:54:07,253 --> 02:54:14,252
your speed becomes zero, so you cannot move.
Attack rolls against you have advantage, and your

2325
02:54:14,252 --> 02:54:17,486
attack rolls have disadvantage. You now have
disadvantage on dexterity saving throws.

2326
02:54:17,486 --> 02:54:20,174
WILL: And you're still going to beat us all.

2327
02:54:20,174 --> 02:54:23,371
TRAVIS: I don't know, it's not a good thing.

2328
02:54:23,371 --> 02:54:24,908
MATT: So Grog, what are you doing?

2329
02:54:24,908 --> 02:54:34,671
TRAVIS: I'm turning toward the black tentacle
dealer, right, and I'm giving her the bird. No, I

2330
02:54:34,671 --> 02:54:41,225
would like to take the Javelin of Lightning and
throw it at Zahra.

2331
02:54:41,225 --> 02:54:51,420
MATT: Okay. Let me see the card? You don't have to
roll for it, it's each creature in the line. It

2332
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:56,427
turns, as you see, Grog, the tentacles, turn
around, and throw something toward you, all of a

2333
02:54:56,427 --> 02:54:59,354
sudden it sparks with electrical energy and
streaks toward you like a bolt of lightning

2334
02:54:59,354 --> 02:55:03,239
horizontally. I need you to make a dexterity
saving throw, Zahra.

2335
02:55:03,239 --> 02:55:09,651
MARY: 12.

2336
02:55:09,651 --> 02:55:13,376
MATT: That's a success, so you take half damage.
Roll 4d6 lightning damage, Grog.

2337
02:55:13,376 --> 02:55:18,346
TRAVIS: Eight.

2338
02:55:18,346 --> 02:55:23,829
MATT: So you take four points of lightning damage
as the javelin streaks past you and skids across

2339
02:55:23,829 --> 02:55:29,631
the stonework behind, sending a few sparks, and
then falls to the ground, its energy used. All

2340
02:55:29,631 --> 02:55:33,328
right. Ends your turn, Grog? Zahra, you're up.

2341
02:55:33,328 --> 02:55:38,614
MARY: Right, so I've still got Witch Bolt on him,
yes? Is that what I used last time?

2342
02:55:38,614 --> 02:55:41,151
MATT: No, you used Evard's Black Tentacles.

2343
02:55:41,151 --> 02:55:45,201
MARY: Oh, I used Evard's Black Tentacles, which is
technically a concentration. It is. So I shall

2344
02:55:45,201 --> 02:55:54,328
use-- is Eldritch Blast? Can I do a combo of
Eldritch and Agonizing again, using my cantrip and

2345
02:55:54,328 --> 02:55:56,350
invocation? Or is that considered concentration?

2346
02:55:56,350 --> 02:56:03,074
MATT: Well, let me see. Agonizing Blast isn't a
cantrip, it's an Eldritch Invocation which gives

2347
02:56:03,074 --> 02:56:12,485
you the benefit on top of your Eldritch Blast. So
yeah, you can do that three times. That's your

2348
02:56:12,485 --> 02:56:17,794
cantrip, and you can do that, yeah. So all three
against him, or do you try and aim for your buddy

2349
02:56:17,794 --> 02:56:18,626
over there?

2350
02:56:18,626 --> 02:56:20,180
MARY: No, we've got to try and take out our giant
friend.

2351
02:56:20,180 --> 02:56:22,649
TRAVIS: I feel so loved.

2352
02:56:22,649 --> 02:56:32,686
MARY: It's a compliment. So that plus the
Agonizing, yeah? It'll still hold the

2353
02:56:32,686 --> 02:56:34,214
concentration?

2354
02:56:34,214 --> 02:56:42,773
MATT: Let me see the Javelin, what it does? Yeah,
I don't know what you guys are talking about. You

2355
02:56:42,773 --> 02:56:49,199
guys are really weird. Oh, and because it is four
damage, go ahead and roll a constitution save to

2356
02:56:49,199 --> 02:56:52,725
maintain concentration on your tentacles.

2357
02:56:52,725 --> 02:56:54,307
MARY: Ten.

2358
02:56:54,307 --> 02:57:00,582
MATT: Ten's enough to keep it, so the tentacles
stay. Thank you for the reminder, guys. So you're

2359
02:57:00,582 --> 02:57:07,012
doing all three against Grog? All right, roll with
advantage on each roll, because of his reckless

2360
02:57:07,012 --> 02:57:08,329
attack.

2361
02:57:08,329 --> 02:57:11,428
MARY: So it's 1d10 plus seven.

2362
02:57:11,428 --> 02:57:15,728
MATT: Go ahead and roll that twice. A nine, roll
again.

2363
02:57:15,728 --> 02:57:19,130
MARY: A nine.

2364
02:57:19,130 --> 02:57:21,074
MATT: All right, so that, what's your AC?

2365
02:57:21,074 --> 02:57:22,582
TRAVIS: 19.

2366
02:57:22,582 --> 02:57:26,661
MATT: 19, it does hit you because you have plus 12
on that attack roll. So roll for the second one.

2367
02:57:26,661 --> 02:57:28,263
That's one hit.

2368
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:29,768
MARY: 11.

2369
02:57:29,768 --> 02:57:32,749
MATT: And roll again? That hits again. Roll for
the third one?

2370
02:57:32,749 --> 02:57:34,535
MARY: 14.

2371
02:57:34,535 --> 02:57:36,215
MATT: Roll again. See if it gets a crit.

2372
02:57:36,215 --> 02:57:37,362
MARY: Natural 20!

2373
02:57:37,362 --> 02:57:50,079
MATT: Two hits and a crit. All right, so let's go
ahead and roll that. So that's one plus seven, so

2374
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:51,851
that's eight points of damage.

2375
02:57:51,851 --> 02:57:53,000
TRAVIS: Bludgeoning?

2376
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,694
MARY: What's the plus 11?

2377
02:57:54,694 --> 02:57:59,756
MATT: No, it's force damage. That's to hit, not
damage. Plus seven that. So that's eight points of

2378
02:57:59,756 --> 02:58:03,191
damage. Second one?

2379
02:58:03,191 --> 02:58:07,189
MARY: Five?

2380
02:58:07,189 --> 02:58:10,317
MATT: Five plus seven is 12 points. And then this
is the crit.

2381
02:58:10,317 --> 02:58:11,663
MARY: Four.

2382
02:58:11,663 --> 02:58:13,222
MATT: So that's eight, plus seven is 15.

2383
02:58:13,222 --> 02:58:19,957
TRAVIS: So 35. Can I use my Stone's Endurance to
limit that damage?

2384
02:58:19,957 --> 02:58:21,512
MATT: From the last one? You can, totally.

2385
02:58:21,512 --> 02:58:24,621
WILL: Got an answer for everything, don't you?

2386
02:58:24,621 --> 02:58:32,129
TRAVIS: No, shut up. So that's 14. No, 15.

2387
02:58:32,129 --> 02:58:34,188
MATT: Okay, so the last critical hit does
nothing.

2388
02:58:34,188 --> 02:58:36,527
TRAVIS: Okay, great. So 20 total.

2389
02:58:36,527 --> 02:58:42,438
MATT: So as you hit him with the final hit, it
slams into him and he puts his chest out, pumps

2390
02:58:42,438 --> 02:58:48,200
it, takes the blast and it seems to disperse
across his muscled form to no effect.

2391
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:50,668
MARY: Oh, it looked so good going in, too!

2392
02:58:50,668 --> 02:58:54,452
TRAVIS: Still pretty good. You actually burned off
the baby oil on these pecs.

2393
02:58:54,452 --> 02:59:05,183
WILL: That's what that smell is! All right. Let's
see if we can keep hitting him.

2394
02:59:05,183 --> 02:59:08,368
TRAVIS: I mean, look guys. Share and share alike.

2395
02:59:08,368 --> 02:59:15,038
WILL: I'm going to move a little closer to him.

2396
02:59:15,038 --> 02:59:16,943
TRAVIS: (whispering) Yeah, come closer.

2397
02:59:16,943 --> 02:59:22,872
WILL: So let's go there.

2398
02:59:22,872 --> 02:59:26,852
TRAVIS: Leave that guardian alone. He doesn't need
to come.

2399
02:59:26,852 --> 02:59:28,900
WILL: He can't come. He'd like to, but he can't.
He just hangs out there.

2400
02:59:28,900 --> 02:59:35,837
MARY: He's eating popcorn the whole time, enjoying
the fight.

2401
02:59:35,837 --> 02:59:42,121
WILL: But he looks awesome. He is, he's guarding
me just in case. He's a place to run back to if I

2402
02:59:42,121 --> 02:59:50,044
need it. I'm going to do another level five Flame
Strike. Yeah, because I can do two level-5s,

2403
02:59:50,044 --> 02:59:58,552
right? It's better than raising the dead. Doesn't
seem apropos at this moment. I would have raised

2404
02:59:58,552 --> 03:00:03,471
you, but you're ashes and you blew away. My bad.

2405
03:00:03,759 --> 03:00:06,319
MARISHA: Yeah, thanks. Matt had to go into
detail.

2406
03:00:06,319 --> 03:00:09,372
WILL: How do you think everything's going,
Keyleth? Oh, you're just ash.

2407
03:00:09,372 --> 03:00:11,588
MATT: All right, so, against who?

2408
03:00:11,588 --> 03:00:13,736
WILL: "Against who!"

2409
03:00:13,736 --> 03:00:16,983
MATT: All right, make a dexterity saving throw
with disadvantage, because you are restrained.

2410
03:00:16,983 --> 03:00:20,385
TRAVIS: 16.

2411
03:00:20,385 --> 03:00:26,813
MATT: 16, not enough. That's a failed save. Do 8d6
damage against Grog.

2412
03:00:26,813 --> 03:00:31,178
WILL: Where are the d6s now? Eight?

2413
03:00:31,178 --> 03:00:34,523
MATT: As you're being held back by the tentacles,
all of a sudden you see another streak of divine

2414
03:00:34,523 --> 03:00:39,462
energy come from the ground as flames erupt from
beneath you. Your vision becomes nothing but

2415
03:00:39,462 --> 03:00:40,557
fire.

2416
03:00:40,557 --> 03:00:42,364
TRAVIS: Not this again-- argh!

2417
03:00:42,364 --> 03:01:04,412
WILL: I have seven here. Here we go, come on. Aw.
Argh! 21, and then one more. Come on. 26.

2418
03:01:04,412 --> 03:01:08,136
MATT: So 26 points of fire damage.

2419
03:01:08,136 --> 03:01:13,696
WILL: To drink my potion, do I need to be able to
move?

2420
03:01:13,696 --> 03:01:17,466
MATT: It's a bonus action in my games, so don't
worry too much about that.

2421
03:01:17,466 --> 03:01:31,804
WILL: I'd like to drink my potion, sir. What do I
need? 8d4 plus eight, is that right?

2422
03:01:31,804 --> 03:01:36,607
MATT: Don't forget, you have your danger
sensibility. Roll another dexterity saving throw,

2423
03:01:36,607 --> 03:01:41,880
to be safe. It's things you can see, like spells
and traps.

2424
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:43,900
TRAVIS: It's a nine.

2425
03:01:43,900 --> 03:01:46,025
MATT: Nah.

2426
03:01:46,025 --> 03:01:48,852
WILL: So I can drink my potion?

2427
03:01:48,852 --> 03:01:57,550
MATT: Sure. 8d4 plus eight. So you're up next,
Grog. Know what you're going to do.

2428
03:01:57,550 --> 03:02:09,284
WILL: (counting)

2429
03:02:09,284 --> 03:02:10,853
MATT: Shitty rolls!

2430
03:02:10,853 --> 03:02:14,251
WILL: Awful rolls. So 22.

2431
03:02:14,251 --> 03:02:17,722
MATT: All right. Grog, I want you to go ahead and
roll a constitution save real fast.

2432
03:02:17,722 --> 03:02:25,481
TRAVIS: I don't like the way you're asking. Ooh,
11?

2433
03:02:25,481 --> 03:02:29,541
MATT: 11. As the flames subside, you take a moment
to take in the damage you've taken. There's a

2434
03:02:29,541 --> 03:02:35,351
familiar smell, a smell you've smelled once before,
when Trinket ran across a series of lightning

2435
03:02:35,523 --> 03:02:38,493
traps: the smell of burnt hair. As you reach up,
you find your chin clean.

2436
03:02:38,493 --> 03:02:41,106
(yelling)

2437
03:02:41,106 --> 03:02:42,755
WILL: I took Grog's beard!

2438
03:02:42,755 --> 03:02:45,544
TRAVIS: No! What have you done!

2439
03:02:45,544 --> 03:02:56,344
MARY: Seppuku with Craven Edge!

2440
03:02:56,344 --> 03:03:02,480
WILL: Kashaw the cleric takes Grog's beard! I want
to see that fan art real bad! That is the end of

2441
03:03:02,480 --> 03:03:05,511
my turn, sir, because I already moved out here, so
I can't move back.

2442
03:03:05,511 --> 03:03:07,224
MATT: Grog, you're up.

2443
03:03:07,224 --> 03:03:08,942
TRAVIS: So I have to break free of the tentacle
trap, right?

2444
03:03:08,942 --> 03:03:11,063
MATT: Yeah, top of the turn, I need you to try and
break free.

2445
03:03:11,063 --> 03:03:15,193
TRAVIS: Son of a fuck! No, I have advantage on
dex, right?

2446
03:03:15,193 --> 03:03:23,076
MATT: You are restrained currently. Let me double
check really fast to make sure we have the

2447
03:03:23,076 --> 03:03:25,303
specifics, here. We haven't used this spell
before.

2448
03:03:25,303 --> 03:03:26,693
TRAVIS: Wienerschnitzel!

2449
03:03:26,693 --> 03:03:37,674
MATT: Okay, so, you take another 3d6 bludgeoning
damage because you started your turn restrained in

2450
03:03:37,674 --> 03:03:39,990
the tentacles. So do another 3d6.

2451
03:03:39,990 --> 03:03:48,110
MARY: Oh, that's better. 11.

2452
03:03:48,110 --> 03:03:55,506
MATT: So you take five points of bludgeoning
damage. Round it down. You have to use an action

2453
03:03:55,506 --> 03:03:57,866
to make a check to try and break free of it.

2454
03:03:57,866 --> 03:04:01,539
TRAVIS: Well, I would like to do that.

2455
03:04:01,539 --> 03:04:04,288
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength or
dexterity check, your choice.

2456
03:04:04,288 --> 03:04:09,167
TRAVIS: Oh, well, I have advantage on both of
those because I'm raging and I have danger sense.

2457
03:04:09,167 --> 03:04:18,776
19, that's good. What am I talking about?
Strength! Thank you! Yeah, 26.

2458
03:04:18,776 --> 03:04:25,862
MATT: All right, not a saving throw. A check.
That's still enough. You break free of the

2459
03:04:25,862 --> 03:04:30,539
tentacles. Break free using your action. You still
have your bonus action and your move, though you

2460
03:04:30,539 --> 03:04:35,898
can't move quite as far. Which way are you going?
You've got two targets right now.

2461
03:04:36,061 --> 03:04:39,336
TRAVIS: I know. I'm going to go towards, ding dang
dong, Zahra.

2462
03:04:39,336 --> 03:04:47,672
MATT: All right. (counting) You can just get up to
her with your barbarian speed.

2463
03:04:47,672 --> 03:04:49,523
TRAVIS: And what do I have left?

2464
03:04:49,523 --> 03:04:50,895
MATT: You have your bonus action still.

2465
03:04:50,895 --> 03:04:58,411
TRAVIS: Just my bonus action. I'll take my potion,
my superior potion, because I can't attack

2466
03:04:58,411 --> 03:05:02,576
anybody. Can I grapple or anything like that?

2467
03:05:02,576 --> 03:05:04,567
MATT: You can attack with your bonus action. You
have frenzied rage, remember?

2468
03:05:04,567 --> 03:05:05,802
TRAVIS: (inarticulate yelling)

2469
03:05:05,802 --> 03:05:07,200
MATT: Up to you!

2470
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,085
TRAVIS: Awesome. Yes, let's do that. Let's attack
her.

2471
03:05:10,085 --> 03:05:16,090
MATT: All right. Go for it. Is this a reckless
attack?

2472
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:18,547
TRAVIS: Yes. 26.

2473
03:05:18,547 --> 03:05:20,199
MATT: 26 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2474
03:05:20,199 --> 03:05:28,496
TRAVIS: You piece of... (counting) 21! In your
horned face!

2475
03:05:28,496 --> 03:05:34,287
MATT: 21 points of damage to you, Zahra. And a
constitution save.

2476
03:05:34,287 --> 03:05:37,004
TRAVIS: Oh, 22 points of damage, because I forgot
to add.

2477
03:05:37,004 --> 03:05:45,790
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check, so
roll another constitution save. Oh, that's a

2478
03:05:45,790 --> 03:05:56,508
failure. The tentacles vanish from the scenery as
the spell disappears. Bye, kernels! I need you to

2479
03:05:56,508 --> 03:06:01,973
make another one from Craven Edge. That is another
failure. You lose another strength point. You're

2480
03:06:01,973 --> 03:06:03,867
now a strength of nine, and you gain another plus
one, Grog.

2481
03:06:03,867 --> 03:06:05,530
TRAVIS: Plus one to attack and damage?

2482
03:06:05,530 --> 03:06:08,102
MATT: Well, plus one to your strength. What is
your strength at, now?

2483
03:06:08,102 --> 03:06:12,496
TRAVIS: Now it is 19.

2484
03:06:12,496 --> 03:06:16,652
MATT: So no bonus yet. Next time. All right, that
ends Grog's turn. Zahra, you're up.

2485
03:06:16,652 --> 03:06:28,924
MARY: All right. My question is, with my dark
staff, does this expend a spell slot?

2486
03:06:28,924 --> 03:06:32,181
MATT: No, it's from the staff itself.

2487
03:06:32,181 --> 03:06:47,315
MARY: Okay. Then I will cast Witch Bolt from my
staff at 5th level. That leaves me with one charge

2488
03:06:47,315 --> 03:06:48,675
left.

2489
03:06:48,675 --> 03:06:53,053
MATT: Okay. Using almost all the charges in that
staff. You still have to make a ranged spell

2490
03:06:53,053 --> 03:06:57,206
attack, which right now would be at disadvantage,
but he attacked so it would be a straight roll. So

2491
03:06:57,206 --> 03:07:09,043
go ahead and do that, roll a d20. That's a nine
plus your spell attack, which is 12. 21. What's

2492
03:07:09,043 --> 03:07:10,540
your AC?

2493
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:11,708
TRAVIS: 19.

2494
03:07:11,708 --> 03:07:19,700
MATT: It hits. That's 5d12 points of lightning
damage against Grog. Five, because she did it at

2495
03:07:19,700 --> 03:07:22,393
5th level.

2496
03:07:22,393 --> 03:07:39,367
MARY: 21 plus 20. These two, it was the nine and
the 11. 41.

2497
03:07:39,367 --> 03:07:43,852
MATT: 41 points of damage to you, Grog. Lightning
damage. All of a sudden, up in your face, she

2498
03:07:43,852 --> 03:07:48,176
holds her staff in her front, closes her eyes, and
a blast of dark lightning hits you.

2499
03:07:48,176 --> 03:07:51,274
MARY: Don't taze me, bro! Sorry, love!

2500
03:07:51,274 --> 03:07:58,439
TRAVIS: It's okay, I'm going to kill you soon.

2501
03:07:58,439 --> 03:08:05,337
MATT: Zahra, is that the end of your turn? You
still have a bonus action.

2502
03:08:05,337 --> 03:08:16,778
MARY: I have a bonus action. What do I do with a
bonus action? If I move, does he get--? Meh.

2503
03:08:16,778 --> 03:08:19,157
MATT: That's Zahra's turn. Kash, you're up.

2504
03:08:19,157 --> 03:08:20,711
WILL: Okay, so I have a question here.

2505
03:08:20,711 --> 03:08:22,593
TRAVIS: Yeah, you can jump in the pit.

2506
03:08:22,593 --> 03:08:32,233
WILL: Can I? Great. Kash goes, I'm out. Taps out
and jumps in the pit. If Will was in the UFC, same

2507
03:08:32,233 --> 03:08:38,527
thing. You mentioned at the beginning of the
battle that we are now on a different plane,

2508
03:08:38,527 --> 03:08:39,864
correct?

2509
03:08:39,864 --> 03:08:43,830
MATT: You are out of your normal vicinity, yes.

2510
03:08:43,830 --> 03:08:48,880
WILL: Okay, but are we on a different spiritual
plane, do we know? I have a question.

2511
03:08:48,880 --> 03:08:54,043
MATT: You also know that you can cast lower spells
at a higher level if you wanted to.

2512
03:08:54,043 --> 03:08:59,170
WILL: I know, but my question is, I have a
wonderful Banishment spell, which is, if we're

2513
03:08:59,170 --> 03:09:03,288
from a different plane, I can Banish him, and if I
can hold the spell for up to a minute, he can't

2514
03:09:03,288 --> 03:09:07,201
come back. So can I banish him from the battle?

2515
03:09:07,201 --> 03:09:08,849
MATT: What's the range on it?

2516
03:09:08,849 --> 03:09:10,849
WILL: 60 feet, but I haven't moved yet.

2517
03:09:10,849 --> 03:09:14,110
MATT: Yeah, if he fails the save, you can banish
him for a period of time to another plane.

2518
03:09:14,110 --> 03:09:20,068
WILL: But that's the thing, according to the
spell, if we're not from this plane, he can't come

2519
03:09:20,068 --> 03:09:22,472
back. It's not just a period of time. He doesn't
return.

2520
03:09:22,472 --> 03:09:29,728
MARISHA: Oh, like, you're going to banish him? Oh
my god, do this. Send him to bizarro world!

2521
03:09:29,728 --> 03:09:34,033
WILL: Because we started, you said, we look up and
we're in a place we didn't know. It seemed like

2522
03:09:34,033 --> 03:09:36,574
we're in a different plane. So if I send him
back?

2523
03:09:36,574 --> 03:09:43,599
MATT: Technically it would be the same plane. It's
just in a different timeline.

2524
03:09:43,599 --> 03:09:47,789
WILL: Okay, so then he can return? Damn.

2525
03:09:47,789 --> 03:09:51,968
MATT: If you were fighting in the Hells, yeah, it
would send you back to the Prime Material Plane

2526
03:09:51,968 --> 03:09:53,646
and he would sit there.

2527
03:09:53,646 --> 03:09:56,260
WILL: Okay, so then it doesn't make any sense,
then.

2528
03:09:56,260 --> 03:09:58,507
MATT: It takes him out of the fight for a while,
but it's your call.

2529
03:09:58,507 --> 03:10:01,529
TRAVIS: Yeah, take me out a bit. You two talk it
out.

2530
03:10:01,529 --> 03:10:08,987
MATT: What are you doing, Kash?

2531
03:10:08,987 --> 03:10:12,172
WILL: I don't have a Flame Strike left. That's my
problem. I'm running out of spells.

2532
03:10:12,172 --> 03:10:18,460
MATT: With a 6th level, you could Flame Strike
both of them if you have one left of that.

2533
03:10:18,460 --> 03:10:20,430
WILL: Oh, I do have a 6th level.

2534
03:10:20,430 --> 03:10:21,735
MATT: Which would do more damage. It's your call.

2535
03:10:21,735 --> 03:10:23,077
WILL: But then she's going to die too!

2536
03:10:23,077 --> 03:10:24,354
MARY: (whispering) I have resistance to fire.

2537
03:10:24,354 --> 03:10:26,014
WILL: Well, then that's what I'm going to do. I'm
going to use a 6th level and I will do a 6th-level

2538
03:10:26,014 --> 03:10:27,620
Flame Strike on him.

2539
03:10:27,620 --> 03:10:29,420
MATT: I was just shooting it out there!

2540
03:10:29,420 --> 03:10:33,795
WILL: No, it's a good idea! I want to Banish him.
I wanted to be nice and go away for a while, but

2541
03:10:33,795 --> 03:10:40,157
he won't, so let's drop a huge thing of fire right
on his face. So we're going to do a 6th-level

2542
03:10:40,157 --> 03:10:43,754
Flame Strike right now.

2543
03:10:43,754 --> 03:11:01,347
MATT: All right, so that's 9d6 points of damage to
each of you. Do you want it to be radiant or fire

2544
03:11:01,347 --> 03:11:04,972
damage more? It's split into two types of damage,
so do you want to do more radiant or more fire

2545
03:11:04,972 --> 03:11:06,539
damage?

2546
03:11:06,539 --> 03:11:08,836
WILL: What hurts more?

2547
03:11:08,836 --> 03:11:17,248
MATT: They both hurt the same, although she's
resistant to fire. So fire or radiant, what are

2548
03:11:17,248 --> 03:11:18,899
you going to do? Just say one or the other.

2549
03:11:18,899 --> 03:11:20,385
WILL: I'm going to do radiant.

2550
03:11:20,385 --> 03:11:27,059
MATT: So roll 5d6 right now. I need you guys to
both make dexterity saving throws.

2551
03:11:27,059 --> 03:11:31,689
TRAVIS: Which I have advantage on.

2552
03:11:31,689 --> 03:11:42,583
WILL: 5d6, come on. I've been rolling crap here.
Let's go. Ones! Everywhere! Three ones. 13.

2553
03:11:42,583 --> 03:11:48,102
MATT: So you take 13 points of radiant damage that
is not reduced. You take 13 points of radiant

2554
03:11:48,102 --> 03:11:50,032
damage. Then roll 4d6 more.

2555
03:11:50,032 --> 03:11:56,653
WILL: Come on, come on. No whammies! Big money, no
Wheatons! Come on!

2556
03:11:56,653 --> 03:12:00,280
MARISHA: Oh my god, so many Wheatons!

2557
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:05,465
MATT: 13 again. So you take 13 points of fire
damage.

2558
03:12:05,465 --> 03:12:07,312
TRAVIS: That's not reduced by making the save
throw?

2559
03:12:07,312 --> 03:12:12,423
MATT: Oh, you made the save! Both of these are
halved. Sorry, I forgot about that. You take half

2560
03:12:12,423 --> 03:12:18,667
of it, so you would be at, it was 13, you'll take
six points of damage.

2561
03:12:18,667 --> 03:12:28,224
WILL: I'm rolling like crap tonight. It was rough!
It could've been a huge strike.

2562
03:12:28,224 --> 03:12:29,713
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

2563
03:12:29,713 --> 03:12:33,554
WILL: Yeah, it ends my turn. Oh wait, I haven't
moved yet! Can I move back to my guardian?

2564
03:12:33,554 --> 03:12:35,242
MATT: Okay.

2565
03:12:35,242 --> 03:12:40,707
MARISHA: I still imagine that it's a giant,
floating popcorn kernel.

2566
03:12:40,707 --> 03:12:42,179
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

2567
03:12:42,179 --> 03:12:49,491
TRAVIS: Right, okay. I would like to attack Zahra
and see how that does with the first of my three

2568
03:12:49,491 --> 03:12:50,773
attacks.

2569
03:12:50,773 --> 03:12:54,358
MATT: All right, make your first strike. With
advantage?

2570
03:12:54,358 --> 03:12:59,199
TRAVIS: Yeah. 23.

2571
03:12:59,199 --> 03:13:00,845
MATT: Her AC's 14. That hit.

2572
03:13:00,845 --> 03:13:04,784
MARY and MARISHA: (singing) So never more shall we
see you again.

2573
03:13:04,784 --> 03:13:08,300
TRAVIS: 21.

2574
03:13:08,300 --> 03:13:09,734
MATT: 21 points of damage.

2575
03:13:09,734 --> 03:13:11,191
MARY: Bye-bye, I'm out.

2576
03:13:11,191 --> 03:13:13,611
MATT: Zahra falls unconscious. I need her to make
a constitution saving throw.

2577
03:13:13,611 --> 03:13:16,077
WILL: Come on, Z!

2578
03:13:16,077 --> 03:13:29,056
MATT: You roll a d20. Okay, so she succeeds. You
are unconscious now, on the ground, bleeding out

2579
03:13:29,056 --> 03:13:33,870
as the blood that you draw from the blade you can
see seeping into the outside of Craven Edge. Grog,

2580
03:13:33,870 --> 03:13:38,217
what do you want to do? She's unconscious at your
feet, and you see Kash in the distance rushing

2581
03:13:38,217 --> 03:13:39,894
near a wall.

2582
03:13:39,894 --> 03:13:41,585
TRAVIS: No, I hit her again.

2583
03:13:41,585 --> 03:13:45,004
MATT: Roll with advantage, twice.

2584
03:13:45,004 --> 03:13:47,641
TRAVIS: 28?

2585
03:13:47,641 --> 03:13:54,468
MATT: That hits. It's an automatic crit, so you
lose two death saving throws. Mark those off. You

2586
03:13:54,468 --> 03:13:59,049
don't roll damage, she just lost two death saving
throws. She's on the edge. You have one more

2587
03:13:59,049 --> 03:14:00,484
attack.

2588
03:14:00,484 --> 03:14:02,834
TRAVIS: Is this my bonus action or one more
attack?

2589
03:14:02,834 --> 03:14:09,274
MATT: This would be your bonus action to attack,
yeah.

2590
03:14:09,274 --> 03:14:20,544
TRAVIS: And I can still move? I would like to run
behind the wall over here. Can I down a Superior

2591
03:14:20,544 --> 03:14:22,823
potion?

2592
03:14:22,823 --> 03:14:32,988
MATT: You haven't used your potion yet, right?
Yeah, you can do that. It's not d6s, it's d4s. 8d4

2593
03:14:32,988 --> 03:14:37,234
plus eight. This is getting intense.

2594
03:14:37,234 --> 03:14:40,711
WILL: It's not getting intense! It's a matter of
time before he comes over and kills me!

2595
03:14:40,711 --> 03:14:44,907
MARISHA: You've done really well.

2596
03:14:44,907 --> 03:14:46,607
WILL: Yeah, because I'm just running away.

2597
03:14:46,607 --> 03:14:49,412
MARISHA: You are kind of taking the defensive
route, which is great.

2598
03:14:49,412 --> 03:14:53,115
TRAVIS: 28 points.

2599
03:14:53,115 --> 03:14:56,612
MATT: All right, so you heal that up. Zahra, it's
your turn. I need you to make a death saving

2600
03:14:56,612 --> 03:14:58,071
throw.

2601
03:14:58,071 --> 03:15:00,985
TRAVIS: Fail it. Fail it, baby. Fail it for me.

2602
03:15:00,985 --> 03:15:05,978
MARY: 16.

2603
03:15:05,978 --> 03:15:13,646
MATT: That's a success, so mark a success. That
brings us to Kash. It's your turn. You have an

2604
03:15:13,646 --> 03:15:17,597
unconscious Zahra over there that you could finish
off, or toss a distant heal if you wanted to bring

2605
03:15:17,597 --> 03:15:22,080
her back. Or go directly after Grog and try and
bring him down.

2606
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:24,258
MARISHA: There might be a cushy water bed in the
pit. You don't know.

2607
03:15:24,258 --> 03:15:30,544
WILL: We're sensing it's <i>not</i> a water bed in the
pit. I don't <i>know</i>, technically, but we're

2608
03:15:30,544 --> 03:15:37,547
sensing it is. I'm at 83, so I don't have to heal
yet. You know what? I'm going to move closer to

2609
03:15:37,547 --> 03:15:44,419
Grog. I've got to start doing some damage. Let's
move. I want to be able to see him. I want a clear

2610
03:15:44,419 --> 03:15:48,265
line of sight on him if we can. Do I have a clear
line of sight?

2611
03:15:48,265 --> 03:15:51,253
MATT: No, you'd have to move over here to get a
clear line of sight on him, really. You could move

2612
03:15:51,253 --> 03:15:55,171
that far, but then you're outside of your
guardian, which you can do if you want.

2613
03:15:55,171 --> 03:15:57,346
MARY: (chicken noises)

2614
03:15:57,346 --> 03:16:00,942
MATT: So what do you want to do?

2615
03:16:00,942 --> 03:16:10,094
WILL: I want to get as close to Grog as I can.
I've got to start doing some damage. He's going to

2616
03:16:10,094 --> 03:16:12,071
fuck me up the next round, but I have to be able
to.

2617
03:16:12,071 --> 03:16:13,894
MATT: You can get there.

2618
03:16:13,894 --> 03:16:15,403
WILL: And can I see him pretty well?

2619
03:16:15,403 --> 03:16:16,382
MATT: You can see him all right.

2620
03:16:16,382 --> 03:16:21,563
WILL: All right, and I can cast them at higher
levels, correct? So I guess that I'm going to have

2621
03:16:21,563 --> 03:16:26,656
to do some damage. I've used my 7th, I've used my
6th, and I've used all my 5th. I have two fours

2622
03:16:26,656 --> 03:16:31,799
left, so I would like to cast Spiritual Weapon,
but at a level four.

2623
03:16:31,799 --> 03:16:36,535
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

2624
03:16:36,535 --> 03:16:38,945
MARY: (coughing) <i>Heal Zahra.</i>

2625
03:16:38,945 --> 03:16:44,379
WILL: My heals <i>are</i> sore! I'm running out of
things.

2626
03:16:44,379 --> 03:16:49,014
MATT: Okay, so you create a floating Spiritual
Weapon.

2627
03:16:49,014 --> 03:16:51,602
WILL: And I think I can hit him twice with this.

2628
03:16:51,815 --> 03:16:53,275
MATT: I will make this little kitten your
Spiritual Weapon. Where do you want to put it,

2629
03:16:53,275 --> 03:16:54,416
within 60 feet?

2630
03:16:54,416 --> 03:16:56,364
WILL: I want to put floating death kitten right in
front of him.

2631
03:16:56,364 --> 03:17:04,712
MATT: All right, little tiny floating death
kitten. So, all right. You have a spirit weapon, a

2632
03:17:04,881 --> 03:17:12,499
giant cat bludgeon, summoned by Vesh, and dark
energy pours off of this floating cat. (cat yowl)

2633
03:17:12,499 --> 03:17:14,081
Every impact.

2634
03:17:14,081 --> 03:17:17,880
WILL: And now, taste Mittens!

2635
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:25,582
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make a melee
spell attack. Roll a d20 twice and add plus ten.

2636
03:17:25,582 --> 03:17:28,628
Take the higher one and add ten.

2637
03:17:28,628 --> 03:17:32,902
WILL: 28.

2638
03:17:32,902 --> 03:17:43,987
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll, is it a 4th
level? Okay, for every two levels, so it takes 2d8

2639
03:17:43,987 --> 03:17:49,520
plus five damage. Roll that twice.

2640
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:55,931
WILL: 16.

2641
03:17:55,931 --> 03:17:59,814
MATT: 16 points of force damage, so it's not
reduced.

2642
03:17:59,814 --> 03:18:03,042
WILL: Mittens is death!

2643
03:18:03,042 --> 03:18:10,057
MATT: (cat noises) You're being bludgeoned by a
somewhat ethereal-looking dark energy kitten.

2644
03:18:10,057 --> 03:18:13,719
WILL: That's right. Who hits you and then goes--
(swipe noise)

2645
03:18:13,719 --> 03:18:17,811
MARY: Plus, Grog's allergic.

2646
03:18:17,811 --> 03:18:28,108
WILL: And now it says here that I can then, as a
bonus action on my turn, I can move the weapon up

2647
03:18:28,108 --> 03:18:38,607
to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a
creature. Again. Okay, so, I want-- Mittens, baby!

2648
03:18:38,607 --> 03:18:49,617
Let's move around the other side and hit him
again! Can we float him around the back or, I

2649
03:18:49,617 --> 03:18:53,535
guess it doesn't really matter.

2650
03:18:53,535 --> 03:18:55,668
MATT: Go ahead and roll again for the attack.
2d20.

2651
03:18:55,668 --> 03:18:58,998
WILL: 2d20. 12, seven.

2652
03:18:58,998 --> 03:19:02,095
MATT: So plus ten, it still hits. Go ahead and
roll 2d8 plus five.

2653
03:19:02,095 --> 03:19:09,436
WILL: Five, seven. 12 plus five, so there we go,
baby.

2654
03:19:09,436 --> 03:19:12,306
MATT: 17 points of force damage.

2655
03:19:12,306 --> 03:19:16,341
TRAVIS: I had exactly 17 hit points left, so I
would like to use my relentless rage.

2656
03:19:16,341 --> 03:19:18,191
MARISHA: Oh, he does have that!

2657
03:19:18,191 --> 03:19:21,763
MATT: Yep, this is where things get real
interesting.

2658
03:19:21,763 --> 03:19:26,806
WILL: Yeah, what exactly is happening? Damn you,
Mittens!

2659
03:19:26,806 --> 03:19:30,241
TRAVIS: I have to make a DC 10 constitution saving
throw. If I succeed, I come back to one hit

2660
03:19:30,241 --> 03:19:31,384
point.

2661
03:19:31,384 --> 03:19:34,608
MATT: Yep. Barbarians.

2662
03:19:34,608 --> 03:19:39,604
WILL: Hey, buddy? I hope you fail. Just want you
to know that.

2663
03:19:39,604 --> 03:19:41,108
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

2664
03:19:41,108 --> 03:19:44,962
MATT: So you are back at one hit point. That ends
your turn, Kash?

2665
03:19:44,962 --> 03:19:47,116
WILL: Yeah, I'm done!

2666
03:19:47,116 --> 03:19:52,769
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

2667
03:19:52,769 --> 03:19:56,932
TRAVIS: Can I stalk toward Kash?

2668
03:19:56,932 --> 03:20:04,178
WILL: Slowly and menacingly? Hey, buddy!

2669
03:20:04,178 --> 03:20:09,063
TRAVIS: How big are you?

2670
03:20:09,063 --> 03:20:18,974
WILL: Oh, shit. I'm guessing 6'8", 280? No, I'm
probably not huge, I would imagine.

2671
03:20:18,974 --> 03:20:26,566
TRAVIS: Can I attempt to pick up Kash and throw
him into the pit? Like, grab him and sumo-Greco,

2672
03:20:26,566 --> 03:20:29,105
whoom!

2673
03:20:29,105 --> 03:20:34,364
MATT: You know what? Go ahead and make a grapple
check. Roll an athletics. You can roll athletics

2674
03:20:34,364 --> 03:20:36,223
or acrobatics.

2675
03:20:36,223 --> 03:20:42,957
WILL: Is it 20? Let me see which is higher. Oh, I
don't have anything. Are these dex? Because I

2676
03:20:42,957 --> 03:20:44,520
don't have anything here.

2677
03:20:44,520 --> 03:20:50,498
MATT: Which is higher, your strength or your dex?
Probably your strength, so roll a d20 and add--

2678
03:20:50,498 --> 03:20:56,307
WILL: Yeah, my strength is higher, but my
acrobatics are two.

2679
03:20:56,307 --> 03:21:00,409
MATT: What's your athletics? Three. So roll a d20
and add three.

2680
03:21:00,409 --> 03:21:04,613
WILL: 19.

2681
03:21:04,613 --> 03:21:06,170
MATT: What'd you roll?

2682
03:21:06,170 --> 03:21:07,368
TRAVIS: 18.

2683
03:21:07,368 --> 03:21:09,391
(exclaiming)

2684
03:21:09,391 --> 03:21:14,660
MATT: So as you go to grab him, you get your hands
on Kash and, as you begin to try and pull, all of

2685
03:21:14,660 --> 03:21:19,812
a sudden Kash's eyes go jet-black and you see this
burst of dark energy around as Vesh comes in to

2686
03:21:19,812 --> 03:21:26,460
protect the one cleric follower. As that happens,
your hands are forced off of his form. You still

2687
03:21:26,460 --> 03:21:28,368
have a bonus action.

2688
03:21:28,368 --> 03:21:35,221
TRAVIS: I do, huh? Can I try it again?

2689
03:21:35,221 --> 03:21:36,941
MATT: No, it's an action to try and grapple.

2690
03:21:36,941 --> 03:21:47,076
TRAVIS: So I could attack? Oh, motherfuck. And
intimidate is an action? Okay, yeah, I'll attack

2691
03:21:47,076 --> 03:21:48,257
him.

2692
03:21:48,257 --> 03:21:50,003
MATT: Great weapon master, or not?

2693
03:21:50,003 --> 03:21:51,295
WILL: It sounds like you're helping him.

2694
03:21:51,295 --> 03:21:52,478
MATT: I've helped you!

2695
03:21:52,478 --> 03:21:54,202
WILL: Well, there's a difference! I suck!

2696
03:21:54,202 --> 03:21:55,992
TRAVIS: You have a high AC, right?

2697
03:21:55,992 --> 03:22:00,346
WILL: I do. Wait, high AC? The attack bonus? No,
my AC is 20.

2698
03:22:00,346 --> 03:22:07,355
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, no great weapon master. Well, all
right, yeah. Let's try it. This one, great weapon

2699
03:22:07,355 --> 03:22:16,667
master, reckless attack. Plus, okay. 26 minus five
is 21.

2700
03:22:16,667 --> 03:22:20,321
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2701
03:22:20,321 --> 03:22:22,641
WILL: Okay, wait now. I have a question, too,
because I also have a Ring of Protection and a

2702
03:22:22,641 --> 03:22:24,197
Sentinel Shield.

2703
03:22:24,197 --> 03:22:25,773
MARY: That's all wrapped up, I think.

2704
03:22:25,773 --> 03:22:27,000
WILL: Does it? Okay.

2705
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:30,528
MATT: I'm double-checking, I'm trying to remember
if grapple is--

2706
03:22:30,528 --> 03:22:34,196
TRAVIS: 35.

2707
03:22:34,196 --> 03:22:38,191
MATT: So 35 points of damage?

2708
03:22:38,191 --> 03:22:43,215
TRAVIS: 35 points of damage and a constitution
save.

2709
03:22:43,215 --> 03:22:44,985
MATT: I'm double-checking one thing, because I'm
trying to remember if grapple is an action or an

2710
03:22:44,985 --> 03:22:46,165
attack.

2711
03:22:46,165 --> 03:22:47,477
WILL: Are you still at one?

2712
03:22:47,477 --> 03:22:48,919
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yeah! Just one!

2713
03:22:48,919 --> 03:22:51,575
WILL: Your voice! (high-pitched) I could tell you,
but yeah!

2714
03:22:51,575 --> 03:22:55,437
TRAVIS: I'm kind of one-eyeing it.

2715
03:22:55,437 --> 03:22:58,586
MARISHA: If you get through this with one hit
point--

2716
03:22:58,586 --> 03:23:02,399
MATT: You also have an additional attack, because
it only takes one attack to attempt to grapple. Or

2717
03:23:02,399 --> 03:23:10,578
you could attempt another grapple. Your call. Do
you want to grapple with your second attack, or do

2718
03:23:10,578 --> 03:23:12,112
you want to hit him again?

2719
03:23:12,112 --> 03:23:13,368
TRAVIS: I'll just hit him again.

2720
03:23:13,368 --> 03:23:15,793
WILL: What was the first damage? 35.

2721
03:23:15,793 --> 03:23:18,051
MATT: Great weapon master, or not?

2722
03:23:18,051 --> 03:23:27,552
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Oh, it rolled over from a 20! Son
of a bitch! Okay.

2723
03:23:27,552 --> 03:23:30,086
WILL: Oh, this sucks. I can't do the math.

2724
03:23:30,086 --> 03:23:33,145
TRAVIS: No, that won't hit. Aw, it rolled over
from a 20!

2725
03:23:33,145 --> 03:23:43,884
MATT: So, as the first strike comes down with
Craven Edge, striking across the armor, it splits

2726
03:23:43,884 --> 03:23:48,912
and beneath you can see the red crimson already
spilling inside. Make a constitution saving throw.

2727
03:23:48,912 --> 03:23:53,992
d20, add your constitution modifier. Two, I
believe, right?

2728
03:23:53,992 --> 03:23:59,278
WILL: Yes. Four! Oh no, wait, I'm sorry. Three.

2729
03:23:59,278 --> 03:24:05,333
MATT: It's a failure! So he steals one of your
strength. Your strength goes up by one.

2730
03:24:05,333 --> 03:24:07,304
WILL: So my strength goes down?

2731
03:24:07,304 --> 03:24:12,314
MATT: It goes down to 16. Doesn't make a huge
difference. So, the second strike comes down

2732
03:24:12,314 --> 03:24:16,562
across with Craven Edge. This time, you put your
shield up, and you can feel the weight of it

2733
03:24:16,562 --> 03:24:22,869
almost pushing you off your feet, but it streaks
across the armor, no impact. That ends Grog's

2734
03:24:22,869 --> 03:24:25,034
turn. Zahra, make another death saving throw.

2735
03:24:25,034 --> 03:24:26,674
WILL: Come on, Z!

2736
03:24:26,674 --> 03:24:28,586
MARISHA: Roll a nat 20!

2737
03:24:28,586 --> 03:24:30,388
MARY: 19.

2738
03:24:30,388 --> 03:24:33,276
TRAVIS: Oh, it rolled over from a one, oh my god.

2739
03:24:33,276 --> 03:24:34,921
MARY: It sure did!

2740
03:24:34,921 --> 03:24:40,189
MATT: Two failures, two successes. Kash, you're
up.

2741
03:24:40,189 --> 03:24:50,463
WILL: I have one more 4th-level spell. I would
like to do another 4th-level Spiritual Weapon.

2742
03:24:50,463 --> 03:24:52,510
MATT: It would replace the other one.

2743
03:24:52,510 --> 03:24:54,331
MARISHA: Yeah, Mittens is still up.

2744
03:24:54,331 --> 03:24:59,457
MATT: You can use your bonus action to send
Mittens there and do another regular attack, or a

2745
03:24:59,457 --> 03:25:06,431
spell if you wanted to. Your call. It's a bonus
action. However, you do need to make a

2746
03:25:06,431 --> 03:25:09,311
concentration check for the damage you took last
turn. What was the total damage of that attack,

2747
03:25:09,311 --> 03:25:12,147
again?

2748
03:25:12,147 --> 03:25:15,030
WILL: It was 35.

2749
03:25:15,182 --> 03:25:21,911
MATT: Total damage, 35? Half of 35, that brings it
to, we'll say 17. Roll a constitution saving

2750
03:25:21,911 --> 03:25:23,023
throw.

2751
03:25:23,023 --> 03:25:28,679
WILL: And it has to be over 17 to see if Mittens
is still in the game? Come on, Mittens! Eight.

2752
03:25:28,679 --> 03:25:38,016
MATT: Nope, Mittens. So Mittens vanished from the
impact, but you can cast it again if you want to.

2753
03:25:38,016 --> 03:25:40,605
WILL: I can cast it again, though, and still hit
twice with it, can't I? Okay, so I'm going to

2754
03:25:40,605 --> 03:25:48,469
bring Mittens back. Hi, baby! So that's the last
of my 4th-level spells, okay.

2755
03:25:48,469 --> 03:25:57,858
MATT: Hold on, let me check one thing really fast.
Spiritual Weapon, checking one thing here. Just to

2756
03:25:57,858 --> 03:26:03,554
make sure. Lot of stuff happening really fast.
Spiritual Weapon is not concentration! My

2757
03:26:03,554 --> 03:26:05,561
apologies. So, you don't have to do that.

2758
03:26:05,561 --> 03:26:08,503
MARY: Mittens lives!

2759
03:26:08,503 --> 03:26:12,204
MATT: I look over and see Travis going like,
concentration check! I'm like shit, right! I need

2760
03:26:12,204 --> 03:26:19,243
to stop doing that. Mittens can move 20 feet and
repeat the attack.

2761
03:26:19,243 --> 03:26:21,737
WILL: Is she 20? Let's get Mittens over there.

2762
03:26:21,737 --> 03:26:23,743
MATT: Roll 2d20.

2763
03:26:23,743 --> 03:26:37,779
WILL: 2d20, come on! 16.

2764
03:26:37,779 --> 03:26:42,980
MATT: 16 plus your spell attack, that'll hit. Go
ahead and roll. Even at a minimum, Grog, I need

2765
03:26:42,980 --> 03:26:46,587
you to make another constitution check, with a DC
of 15 now.

2766
03:26:46,587 --> 03:26:51,581
TRAVIS: Yep. Yes! 28.

2767
03:26:51,581 --> 03:26:57,995
MATT: 28. Still at one hit point, Grog takes the
hit, almost goes down and then comes right back up

2768
03:26:57,995 --> 03:26:59,537
at the feet, angry.

2769
03:26:59,537 --> 03:27:02,930
WILL: Okay, so can I attack again?

2770
03:27:02,930 --> 03:27:07,578
MATT: You can use your action now to do something
else. Only a bonus action can do that. So now you

2771
03:27:07,578 --> 03:27:10,664
have your action. You could hit with your spear,
or you could do another spell if you wanted to.

2772
03:27:10,664 --> 03:27:20,800
TRAVIS: Now it's 20? (singing) Living on a
prayer!

2773
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:28,219
WILL: He's going to pick my ass up and throw me
somewhere.

2774
03:27:28,219 --> 03:27:30,843
MATT: You still have your action. What are you
going to do?

2775
03:27:30,843 --> 03:27:33,806
WILL: But I could also run back to my guardian.

2776
03:27:33,806 --> 03:27:36,990
MATT: You could, yeah. He'll get an attack on you
if you run.

2777
03:27:36,990 --> 03:27:43,819
WILL: I think I'm going to have to hit him with my
spear, which has six points of nec on it, right?

2778
03:27:43,819 --> 03:27:45,279
Yeah, let's do that.

2779
03:27:45,279 --> 03:27:54,504
MATT: All right, roll 2d20, adding ten to each
hit. So go ahead. I'm sorry, adding nine.

2780
03:27:54,504 --> 03:27:55,809
WILL: 18.

2781
03:27:55,809 --> 03:27:57,398
MATT: Roll again.

2782
03:27:57,398 --> 03:28:00,375
WILL: Four.

2783
03:28:00,375 --> 03:28:04,322
MATT: Yeah, so you hit it. The damage hits. I need
you to make another constitution saving throw. DC

2784
03:28:04,322 --> 03:28:06,223
of 20, buddy.

2785
03:28:06,223 --> 03:28:08,408
TRAVIS: That won't do it. That's a 14.

2786
03:28:08,408 --> 03:28:13,136
MATT: (chuckles) How do you want to do this?

2787
03:28:13,136 --> 03:28:16,022
(yelling)

2788
03:28:16,022 --> 03:28:18,667
TRAVIS: Wait, don't I get saving throws and
stuff?!

2789
03:28:18,667 --> 03:28:22,287
MATT: Well, in theory, he could finish you off
next round.

2790
03:28:22,287 --> 03:28:31,041
TRAVIS: (stammering) All right.

2791
03:28:31,041 --> 03:28:32,699
MARY: Severe allergies.

2792
03:28:32,699 --> 03:28:34,743
TRAVIS: That's true. Severe allergies.

2793
03:28:34,743 --> 03:28:38,388
WILL: So is this a straight-up attack with the
spear?

2794
03:28:38,388 --> 03:28:40,462
MATT: This is your dark spear, the Shadow Spear.

2795
03:28:40,462 --> 03:28:50,422
WILL: So he walks over to Grog standing in front
of him, and he looks him up and down. You are the

2796
03:28:50,422 --> 03:28:55,880
biggest individual I've ever faced in my life. See
ya! Right through the chest!

2797
03:28:55,880 --> 03:29:01,141
MATT: As the Shadow Spear pierces the front of
your unarmored chest, it goes sticking out the

2798
03:29:01,141 --> 03:29:06,704
back of your torso. At that moment, you can see
his eyes go dark once again as the spear itself

2799
03:29:06,704 --> 03:29:11,764
sends this cold wave through your body, the
necrotic enchantment on the spear sucking the life

2800
03:29:11,764 --> 03:29:16,130
from you. You watch as Grog reaches out, grabbing
it, but his muscles wither and atrophy within a

2801
03:29:16,130 --> 03:29:20,910
matter of seconds, his face going sallow, his
entire life force drained into the spear as you

2802
03:29:20,910 --> 03:29:28,460
withdraw it from his body. The now extremely
malnourished, shriveled body of Grog crumples to

2803
03:29:28,460 --> 03:29:34,756
the ground with a cracking sound of bones against
stone. You hear in the back of your head, now, a

2804
03:29:34,756 --> 03:29:41,691
voice that says, "You've proven yourself worthy.
Lift me. Become my new master."

2805
03:29:41,691 --> 03:29:47,845
WILL: Can Kash do something here?

2806
03:29:47,845 --> 03:29:49,375
MATT: Yeah.

2807
03:29:49,375 --> 03:29:56,292
WILL: He reaches down, picks up the blade, and
says, I've already had one dark master. Throws it

2808
03:29:56,292 --> 03:29:57,608
in the pit.

2809
03:29:57,608 --> 03:30:00,072
MATT: (blade spinning through air, impact)

2810
03:30:00,072 --> 03:30:02,338
I need you to roll another death saving
throw.

2811
03:30:02,338 --> 03:30:06,561
MARY: Two.

2812
03:30:06,561 --> 03:30:10,935
MATT: Two. And with that, you hear in the distance
this small (exhale).

2813
03:30:10,935 --> 03:30:12,801
(laughter)

2814
03:30:12,801 --> 03:30:15,995
MATT: As the last of Zahra's life force expires
and her body disappears.

2815
03:30:15,995 --> 03:30:18,577
WILL: There can be only one!

2816
03:30:18,577 --> 03:30:23,403
MATT: There was a slight chance you would have
rolled a 20, and it would've been great if you

2817
03:30:23,403 --> 03:30:24,952
woke up and went--

2818
03:30:24,952 --> 03:30:26,774
TRAVIS: What are you at?

2819
03:30:26,774 --> 03:30:28,830
WILL: 43.

2820
03:30:28,830 --> 03:30:31,633
MARY: No, he would've taken me out.

2821
03:30:31,633 --> 03:30:32,743
WILL: 48.

2822
03:30:32,743 --> 03:30:34,693
TRAVIS: Man. You're sitting pretty.

2823
03:30:34,693 --> 03:30:36,197
MARISHA: Wow.

2824
03:30:36,197 --> 03:30:38,800
(cheering)

2825
03:30:38,800 --> 03:30:40,269
MARY: That was amazing.

2826
03:30:40,269 --> 03:30:44,651
WILL: That is ridiculously exhilarating. It was
cool.

2827
03:30:44,651 --> 03:30:46,839
MARY: So much fun! Thank you.

2828
03:30:46,839 --> 03:30:51,855
MATT: Well done, guys. That was really
interesting.

2829
03:30:51,855 --> 03:30:55,212
TRAVIS: You all wake up in your bed and go,
(gasps). Oh man.

2830
03:30:55,212 --> 03:31:00,468
MARISHA: I had a terrible dream! You were there,
and you were there, and you were there.

2831
03:31:00,468 --> 03:31:04,212
MARY: And you weren't there, but I felt you there,
and you were evil.

2832
03:31:04,212 --> 03:31:09,293
MARISHA: I hope I never get on Grog's shit list.

2833
03:31:09,293 --> 03:31:11,376
WILL: I though you were going to chuck me into the
pit.

2834
03:31:11,376 --> 03:31:13,704
MARISHA: Oh, by one point.

2835
03:31:13,704 --> 03:31:16,664
TRAVIS: I thought you were lower. I should have
done another grapple check, but hey.

2836
03:31:16,664 --> 03:31:18,461
MATT: It's okay.

2837
03:31:18,461 --> 03:31:20,841
MARISHA: And the maiden voyage of the Dwarven
Forge.

2838
03:31:20,841 --> 03:31:22,121
MARY: Yeah.

2839
03:31:22,121 --> 03:31:23,752
MARISHA: It looks so great.

2840
03:31:23,752 --> 03:31:25,324
WILL: Kittens and popcorn!

2841
03:31:25,324 --> 03:31:27,419
MATT: I'll remember to bring my proper minis next
time.

2842
03:31:27,419 --> 03:31:32,339
MARY: Keyleth should feel very complimented that
we felt the need to take you out first.

2843
03:31:32,339 --> 03:31:35,203
WILL: Talk about coming in swinging. My god.

2844
03:31:35,203 --> 03:31:39,579
MARISHA: Falling through the sky as a dead bird.

2845
03:31:39,579 --> 03:31:52,992
MATT: So yeah, the pit, if anyone would have
fallen in there-- you saw the texture in the

2846
03:31:52,992 --> 03:32:04,058
bottom-- it was a cluster of undead that would
grab and pull down and devour. Every single turn,

2847
03:32:04,058 --> 03:32:10,070
you'd have to roll to try and get out of the
grasp. If not, you'd be restrained and be taking

2848
03:32:10,070 --> 03:32:13,493
3d10 points of damage every turn.

2849
03:32:13,493 --> 03:32:16,708
MARY: Isn't there a spell that lets us control
undead?

2850
03:32:16,708 --> 03:32:18,506
MATT: There are spells like that, yeah.

2851
03:32:18,506 --> 03:32:20,599
WILL: I have a question, because one of the things
I was going to do, but then it looked like I

2852
03:32:20,599 --> 03:32:24,679
wasn't going to be able to-- if you take control
of a creature, you can't then have them do

2853
03:32:24,679 --> 03:32:28,650
something that will commit suicide, right? So I
couldn't have taken control of Grog and gone: jump

2854
03:32:28,650 --> 03:32:30,248
in the pit.

2855
03:32:30,248 --> 03:32:33,858
MARISHA: Well, is jump in the pit considered
suicidal?

2856
03:32:33,858 --> 03:32:35,337
MATT: Which spell is this?

2857
03:32:35,337 --> 03:32:36,896
WILL: Geas.

2858
03:32:36,896 --> 03:32:45,689
MARY: What if you suggested to him, Grog, I saw a
cask of ale down in the pit. Go get it!

2859
03:32:45,689 --> 03:32:47,399
TRAVIS: I'd jump in there after that.

2860
03:32:47,399 --> 03:32:49,028
MARISHA: I want to get into some Kilgrave shit.

2861
03:32:49,028 --> 03:32:56,124
MATT: Geas isn't a direct-- you don't command them
to do a specific action; you tell them to complete

2862
03:32:56,124 --> 03:33:00,317
this task for you and they're compelled to do it
and if they resist it they take damage. The moment

2863
03:33:00,317 --> 03:33:03,520
you send someone on a suicidal impact, the spell
immediately breaks.

2864
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:10,910
MARISHA: But would "Hey, explore the bottom of
this pit" be considered a suicidal action?

2865
03:33:10,910 --> 03:33:13,843
WILL: You still know you're sending him to a
suicidal mission, though, right? So wouldn't that

2866
03:33:13,843 --> 03:33:15,164
essentially break the spell?

2867
03:33:15,164 --> 03:33:19,593
MATT: Possibly, but you could be like, "hey, I
need you to focus your attacks on Zahra," then he

2868
03:33:19,593 --> 03:33:22,670
could choose to do that or try to resist it and
take the psychic damage.

2869
03:33:22,670 --> 03:33:31,698
MARY: Could I have used Mass Suggestion to go:
"Guys, there's ale or something in the pit. Go

2870
03:33:31,698 --> 03:33:33,180
"find it."

2871
03:33:33,180 --> 03:33:38,836
MATT: It would've been a hard sell. With a really
low saving throw roll, a player could have been

2872
03:33:38,836 --> 03:33:43,405
compelled to lose a round to inspect, but it
wouldn't have been like "Yeah, sure!" and then

2873
03:33:43,405 --> 03:33:44,629
dove in.

2874
03:33:44,629 --> 03:33:46,987
WILL: Man, that was fun.

2875
03:33:46,987 --> 03:33:48,551
TRAVIS: That was really great.

2876
03:33:48,551 --> 03:33:52,456
MATT: Also, don't forget to check your casting
times, as well. I don't know what the Geas casting

2877
03:33:52,456 --> 03:33:53,683
time is.

2878
03:33:53,683 --> 03:33:56,239
WILL: Casting time's one minute.

2879
03:33:56,239 --> 03:33:59,924
MATT: Yeah, that would not be a combat spell.
Every round in combat is six seconds, so that

2880
03:33:59,924 --> 03:34:02,508
would have been a spell you could do outside of
combat.

2881
03:34:02,508 --> 03:34:04,122
MARISHA: What spell?

2882
03:34:04,122 --> 03:34:05,115
MATT: Geas.

2883
03:34:05,115 --> 03:34:06,180
MARISHA: Oh, right.

2884
03:34:06,180 --> 03:34:08,637
TRAVIS: Nicely done, Matt. Nicely done, Kashaw!

2885
03:34:08,637 --> 03:34:11,678
(applause)

2886
03:34:11,678 --> 03:34:13,798
WILL: I'm just a healer!

2887
03:34:13,798 --> 03:34:16,500
TRAVIS: I guess you can put one more notch on that
arm now.

2888
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:20,674
WILL: Hitting the deck, though. My god. Mittens.

2889
03:34:20,674 --> 03:34:24,139
TRAVIS: El gato es diablo.

2890
03:34:24,139 --> 03:34:31,422
MATT: Cool. So yeah, depending on if some point
down the road, we have the opportunity, like the

2891
03:34:31,422 --> 03:34:34,239
break after a major story arc when we run another
one of these games, but with the entire Vox

2892
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:40,778
Machina party, which would be fun. That would be a
ways off, but you saw this was fun to do. We'll

2893
03:34:40,778 --> 03:34:42,231
try that sometime.

2894
03:34:42,231 --> 03:34:45,208
WILL: I'd like to think as reigning champion I'd
be allowed to come back to defend my title.

2895
03:34:45,208 --> 03:34:48,400
MARY: You can think that as long as you'd like.

2896
03:34:48,400 --> 03:34:50,741
TRAVIS: We'll free up our own Summer Slam.

2897
03:34:50,741 --> 03:34:52,710
(laughter)

2898
03:34:52,710 --> 03:34:54,530
WILL: Oh, that's awesome.

2899
03:34:54,530 --> 03:35:02,625
MATT: And a great example of the power of warlocks
being nasty, the survivability of barbarians being

2900
03:35:02,625 --> 03:35:06,811
ridiculous, although it was you versus three magic
casters, which was not a good fight, but even

2901
03:35:06,811 --> 03:35:07,888
so--

2902
03:35:07,888 --> 03:35:09,925
TRAVIS: I was getting blasted.

2903
03:35:09,925 --> 03:35:14,742
MATT: And even so, it came down to quite literally
one roll, because if that hadn't taken you out,

2904
03:35:14,742 --> 03:35:19,699
that last spear hit, if you would have survived
that saving throw, you would have had three

2905
03:35:19,699 --> 03:35:24,097
attacks on him next round, and with great weapon
master, two of them would have taken him down.

2906
03:35:24,097 --> 03:35:34,872
WILL: Crazy powerful stuff. Running away is really
helpful at times. Sometimes, concession is the

2907
03:35:34,872 --> 03:35:36,160
better part of valor.

2908
03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:37,433
TRAVIS: Black tentacles.

2909
03:35:37,433 --> 03:35:38,658
WILL: Holding him there.

2910
03:35:38,658 --> 03:35:44,256
MARY: My suggestion to Travis was two of you both
jump into the pit, and then I lose my saving throw

2911
03:35:44,256 --> 03:35:46,052
and nobody wins!

2912
03:35:46,052 --> 03:35:47,639
(laughter)

2913
03:35:47,639 --> 03:35:49,987
WILL: It's just that voice going, "Guys?"

2914
03:35:49,987 --> 03:35:55,623
MATT: That's amazing. Guys, thank you so much for
coming.

2915
03:35:55,623 --> 03:35:59,115
MARY: Feel better, Laura and Liam.

2916
03:35:59,115 --> 03:36:06,208
MATT: Yeah, seriously. There will be no actual
session here. Me and Marisha will be out of town;

2917
03:36:06,208 --> 03:36:13,625
we're going to be at Kazuku Con in Cork,
Ireland. See you guys there. There will be no

2918
03:36:13,625 --> 03:36:15,927
show. There'll be stuff going on. They'll have
content here that they're going to decide on who to

2919
03:36:15,927 --> 03:36:20,224
show here, so keep an eye on the social media
platform to tell you what to look forward to in

2920
03:36:20,224 --> 03:36:23,995
our slot next week, and we will return for the
next session of Vox Machina's adventures on March

2921
03:36:23,995 --> 03:36:25,039
9th.

2922
03:36:25,039 --> 03:36:28,690
MARISHA: Do we have any giveaways that we need to
announce? Giveaway winners?

2923
03:36:28,690 --> 03:36:31,294
MARY: We have so much stuff to give away.

2924
03:36:31,294 --> 03:36:33,086
MARISHA: I know, there was so much stuff to give
away.

2925
03:36:33,086 --> 03:36:35,411
RYAN: Yeah, let's do a giveaway.

2926
03:36:35,411 --> 03:36:38,688
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. Giveaway.

2927
03:36:38,688 --> 03:36:40,538
WILL: You've got the Brandon Sanderson books.

2928
03:36:40,538 --> 03:36:42,942
MARISHA: Brandon Sanderson books and nail wraps.

2929
03:36:42,942 --> 03:36:45,602
RYAN: We were so enthralled with this that we
forgot to do our jobs.

2930
03:36:45,602 --> 03:36:47,833
(laughter)

2931
03:36:47,833 --> 03:36:52,608
WILL: That's when you know it's a good game! That
was really cool.

2932
03:36:52,608 --> 03:36:56,648
MARISHA: What was the book called, again?

2933
03:36:56,648 --> 03:37:02,278
TRAVIS: Two nuclear clouds. (explosion) Oh, that
sucked. Shit! (explosion)

2934
03:37:02,278 --> 03:37:07,172
WILL: It wasn't until the last move that I was
like, "Oh, right. I'm carrying a spear."

2935
03:37:07,172 --> 03:37:13,859
MARISHA: I feel like it was that scene in Sleepy
Hollow in the end, where the lighthouse is on

2936
03:37:13,859 --> 03:37:18,792
fire, then Grog walks out of it. That's what I
envision.

2937
03:37:18,792 --> 03:37:21,464
WILL: The last one was awesome.

2938
03:37:21,464 --> 03:37:26,607
MATT: All right, so you guys jump in there to see
if we have a winner here momentarily. I can see

2939
03:37:26,607 --> 03:37:28,203
you guys being active in there, which is awesome.

2940
03:37:28,203 --> 03:37:36,771
MARISHA: Be active! Check out The Bands of
Mourning. And Espionage Cosmetics! They have nerdy

2941
03:37:36,771 --> 03:37:42,517
makeup. Nerd makeup. It's a thing.

2942
03:37:42,517 --> 03:37:49,242
MATT, MARISHA, and MARY: You guys.

2943
03:37:49,242 --> 03:37:55,036
MARY: I really wanted to make Keyleth my willing
zombie slave.

2944
03:37:55,036 --> 03:37:56,873
MARISHA: That would have been really cool.

2945
03:37:56,873 --> 03:38:01,175
MARY: If I'd killed her with Finger of Death, she
would've come back as my zombie slave.

2946
03:38:01,175 --> 03:38:05,541
TRAVIS: You're dark, sister. I like it.

2947
03:38:05,541 --> 03:38:08,311
MARISHA: That took me down half my hit points.

2948
03:38:08,311 --> 03:38:10,515
MARY: Also what?

2949
03:38:10,515 --> 03:38:12,161
WILL: She also knits!

2950
03:38:12,161 --> 03:38:15,060
MARY and TRAVIS: Crochet!

2951
03:38:15,060 --> 03:38:16,658
MARY: Yes, lots of crochet.

2952
03:38:16,658 --> 03:38:20,940
WILL: Man, that was fun. When's the last time you
played as a player?

2953
03:38:20,940 --> 03:38:23,277
MATT: D&D?

2954
03:38:23,277 --> 03:38:24,839
WILL: Yeah.

2955
03:38:24,839 --> 03:38:29,923
MATT: A friend of mine, Matt Colville, who's the
writer for Evolve at Turtle Rock Studios, he had

2956
03:38:29,923 --> 03:38:34,827
me and Marisha and Liam and our friend Frieda down
to play a one-shot down at his studio back in

2957
03:38:34,827 --> 03:38:36,084
September.

2958
03:38:36,084 --> 03:38:37,519
WILL: Was that fun to not have to worry--

2959
03:38:37,519 --> 03:38:39,179
MATT: It was great! I missed that.

2960
03:38:39,179 --> 03:38:40,693
MARY: What were you?

2961
03:38:40,693 --> 03:38:44,518
MATT: I was a tiefling paladin. Oath of Vengeance,
named Marduun. It was fun.

2962
03:38:44,518 --> 03:38:48,343
TRAVIS: Oath of Vengeance named Marduun?

2963
03:38:48,343 --> 03:38:55,045
MATT: Paladins choose oaths as their variations,
and I was Oath of Vengeance. It was fun. That was

2964
03:38:55,045 --> 03:38:59,438
the last time, the only time I've played a player
character in D&D in years.

2965
03:38:59,438 --> 03:39:00,778
WILL: That must be fun.

2966
03:39:00,778 --> 03:39:03,081
MARISHA: Do we have a winner?

2967
03:39:03,081 --> 03:39:05,890
TRAVIS: Do we have a name? What?

2968
03:39:05,890 --> 03:39:16,916
MARY: I have no idea. Corbin? Corbin? Ow! It
hurts!

2969
03:39:16,916 --> 03:39:21,193
WILL: It's always something! A bomb, or something!
I mean it.

2970
03:39:21,193 --> 03:39:24,805
(laughter)

2971
03:39:24,805 --> 03:39:26,388
WILL: Corbin. Corbin!

2972
03:39:26,388 --> 03:39:28,877
MARY: I quit smoking. I have no fire!

2973
03:39:28,877 --> 03:39:32,447
MARISHA: This is pretty great fan art that came
out recently.

2974
03:39:32,447 --> 03:39:34,871
MARY: Is it Mittens?

2975
03:39:34,871 --> 03:39:38,924
MARISHA: It's all of us as the characters sitting
around a table.

2976
03:39:38,924 --> 03:39:41,587
MARY: Oh my god, that's amazing! Wendy, you're in
this.

2977
03:39:41,587 --> 03:39:43,529
WENDY: Oh my god!

2978
03:39:43,529 --> 03:39:45,731
MARISHA: I'll show it to Travis.

2979
03:39:45,731 --> 03:39:47,438
