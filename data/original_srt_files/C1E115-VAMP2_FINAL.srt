1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:04,800
TALIESIN: Didn't work last week, why was it going
to work this week? Good evening everybody, and

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:21,027
welcome to the second part of our Vampire-palooza
here on Critical Role. (laughter) Yes. While Matt

3
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:25,881
and Marisha are off on vacation somewhere warm and
bright, we will be slinking through the darkness

4
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:31,678
of Los Angeles. Currently, gosh, everybody looks
so pretty. Actually, it's really hot in here, so

5
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,253
I'm going to--

6
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,702
LAURA: We already know where you are. The hood is
pointless.

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,736
LIAM: Taliesin, when did you get here?!

8
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,598
LAURA: We're all going to have lisps tonight, you
guys.

9
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:43,390
LIAM: I am going to see how long I can last with
these fuckers in.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,788
LAURA: Because you have really big fangs.

11
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,575
TRAVIS: You've already fallen apart.

12
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:51,134
LIAM: Yeah, I know. If I can talk with a southern
accent, I'm fine. But other than that, I ain't

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:56,039
good. So I'll give you about ten minutes before
these suckers come out.

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:05,263
TALIESIN: I heard vampires burn. Get the diesel.
Yeah, everybody looks spectacular. That's a great

15
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,288
cake, by the way. We'll see how long that lasts.

16
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:09,519
SAM: You're from Portal?

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,518
LAURA: Yeah, I'm from Portal! I'm Chell.

18
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:16,611
SAM: And you're Assassin's Creed? Okay, I guessed
on that one.

19
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,058
TRAVIS: And Liam is?

20
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:20,610
LIAM: Hold on, let me check my Pip Boy. Yep.

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,447
LAURA: It really is a Pip Boy! It's so cool!

22
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:27,139
TRAVIS: Sam, what is Liam from?

23
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,894
SAM: He's from Fallout, he told me.

24
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:30,205
TALIESIN: I'm so impressed so far.

25
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,940
LAURA: And what is Travis from?

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,679
SAM: That's the only one I know. He is Ellie from
The Last of Us.

27
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,066
TRAVIS: That's right. Yep.

28
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,423
LIAM: That's the worst Q-Bert cosplay I've ever
seen.

29
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:40,408
LAURA: You're Kirby?

30
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:41,821
SAM: I'm Pac-Man.

31
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,811
LAURA: Oh.

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,210
TRAVIS: Are you?

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:51,750
SAM: This is apparently Pac-Man. This was $14 on
Amazon and it does not look like Pac-Man to me. It

34
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,947
looks like an M&M.

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:02:01,554
TALIESIN: It looks like a peanut M&M that's really
pretending it didn't have a bad day.

36
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:05,182
TRAVIS: Little Shop of Horrors meets peanut M&Ms.

37
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:09,677
LIAM: I've had bad dreams about this.

38
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:15,508
TALIESIN: It's really intense. I feel like, yeah,
between the two of us, with the $15 costume

39
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:27,125
contest. I'm always a fan of a cheap trip to Hot
Topic, so. We have a sponsor tonight! We are being

40
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:33,436
brought to you by Tor Books. Does Pac-Man have
anything to--?

41
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:38,151
SAM: Tor Books! Today's episode is brought to you
by our friends at Tor Books, America's largest

42
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:43,739
publisher of science fiction and fantasy. On
November 14th, Tor Books is proud to release

43
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:52,045
Oathbringer, by Brandon Sanderson. The third book
in the #1 best-selling Stormlight Archive follows

44
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:57,341
The Way of the Wings and Words of Radiance. To
gear up for your return to Roshar, which

45
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:01,998
apparently is something from the book, Tor Books
is celebrating by offering fans a chance to win an

46
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:11,116
exclusive, one-of-a-kind Bag of Holding. This 100%
leather messenger bag was handcrafted by Beastman

47
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:16,548
Caravan and contains a copy of Oathbringer to help
you on your quest. For a chance to win and for

48
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:21,208
official rules, visit the link that will be on
your screen, and follow Tor on Twitter at

49
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:29,634
@torbooks to tell them what's in your Bag of
Holding using the hashtag #torbagofholding.

50
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:36,392
Because they're watching, guys, real quick,
they're a huge sci-fi publisher. This is my chance

51
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,879
to pitch my book.

52
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,961
TRAVIS: That's really smart!

53
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:44,187
SAM: I've been pitching it around town, not really
getting traction, but they're watching. Captive

54
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:45,110
audience.

55
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,618
LIAM: And you are dressed for success.

56
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:56,259
SAM: So bear with me. Here's my pitch. Elevator
pitch. The year is 9999 and techno-cyber detective

57
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:02,585
Icarus Dunk is tracking the infamous Extonium
bandit, Wrath McQuaid through the radiation mines

58
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:08,406
of Sector Nine. Armed with his trademark time
cannon, Icarus came ready for danger, but didn't

59
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:15,299
bargain for love. At a hex-fuel outpost in the
desert world of Crypto-Diphthong Nine, Icarus'

60
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,747
ship, the STS Peacock, docks with a mysterious
vessel piloted by the most beautiful Gorgon he's

61
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:29,251
ever laid his eyes on: the leggy, legendary
ecto-crystal smuggler named Crasnogorofst Nine.

62
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:37,196
All of her faces are as gorgeous as her name. With
Icarus and Crasnogorofst Nine together, will the

63
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:43,587
universe ever be the same? Think of it like
Ender's Game meets Dune, but with Asimov dialog

64
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:49,896
and Heinlein twists, and a little dash of, I don't
know, The Name of the Wind or something.

65
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,330
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure there was some Rick and
Morty in there too.

66
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,746
SAM: It's available. It doesn't currently have a
publisher yet. Also, I haven't written it yet. I'm

67
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,185
trying to sell it on the pitch.

68
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,356
LAURA: Yeah, good call.

69
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:04,125
SAM: Thank you, Tor Books! Please buy my book.

70
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,918
TRAVIS: Laura will be stealing this book.

71
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,324
LAURA: Yes I will!

72
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:13,862
TALIESIN: On that note of stealing books, I don't
know, that was my best segue. It's the segue I

73
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,568
have. We go with the segues we have. Merchandise.

74
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,998
LAURA: How is that at all having to do with--

75
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:23,353
TALIESIN: I didn't say it was a good segue, I said
it was the segue we have.

76
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:29,852
LAURA: Okay, I'm really-- it's hard to tell if
these cameras are on us, but I think that they are.

77
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,868
TALIESIN: This new setup is very strange.

78
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:36,647
LAURA: I have two things to tell you about
tonight. This is good for the holidays.

79
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:42,194
LIAM: I am so excited.

80
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:53,671
LAURA: These are Strongjaw Ale coasters! For your
personal Strongjaw bar at home! Look at these

81
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,023
fucking-- and they're like, rubbery. They're cool
as fuck.

82
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,342
TALIESIN: The back of them is pretty cool, too.

83
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:04,074
SAM: Aged six months in a Bag of Holding.

84
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:10,577
LAURA: Like our shirts, man! With our Critical
Role logo! It's pretty tight!

85
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,440
TRAVIS: And it's, like, super textured.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,570
LAURA: In addition to those wonderful stocking
stuffers, I have, okay, so these have been in the

87
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:30,100
works for a very freaking long time. Finally, we
can announce them! With teeth in our mouth. Okay,

88
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:38,588
okay! So, it's a set of d20s, but they're all
inspired by our characters. We designed all of our

89
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:44,446
dice ourselves. And it comes in this Vox Machina
logo bag, but it looks like it's from Gilmore's

90
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,287
Glorious Goods!

91
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:50,401
LIAM: We picked the texture and the color and the
design for the d20!

92
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:53,093
LAURA: I have never sounded nerdier in my entire
life, and I love it.

93
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,067
TRAVIS: All the d20s are something different.

94
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,967
LAURA: Sam, yours is a total troll dice.

95
00:06:56,967 --> 00:07:00,860
SAM: Is this mine? I can't read it.

96
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,913
LAURA: You specifically asked for--

97
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,297
SAM: This was a long time ago.

98
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:07,648
LAURA: Yeah. You were like, "I want people to not
be able to read it."

99
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,167
SAM: Yeah, I'm a dick.

100
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:14,284
LAURA: So his is sparkly with purple on pink. It's
really hard to read.

101
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,156
TRAVIS: Keyleth's has antlers.

102
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:20,219
LAURA: Mine is really beautiful because it's
inspired by my white dragon armor.

103
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,198
TRAVIS: Mine has a big ale of mug on the 20.

104
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,361
LAURA: Yeah, and the 20s have our little icon on
the 20!

105
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,055
TALIESIN: This is the Sarenrae logo.

106
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:32,815
TRAVIS: Oh, yours is dope, with the two arrows and
the bear paw! It looks all marble-ized!

107
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:36,136
LAURA: And he's got the de Rolo family crest.

108
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,234
LIAM: I have a dagger and a feather crossed into
an X.

109
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,769
TRAVIS: What nerd got a book on theirs as the 20?

110
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,289
LAURA: I know, what a loser.

111
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,165
LIAM: Who likes books? Except books from Tor
Books!

112
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,106
LAURA: There's the segue!

113
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:54,409
TRAVIS: Get your d20! And it's soft, as with all
of our things.

114
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,689
LAURA: Online, right now! They're in the store
right now!

115
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,576
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I can't believe it finally
happened.

116
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,177
LAURA: I know, in the store! Right now!

117
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:05,310
TALIESIN: We have been working on this for quite a
while.

118
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,652
LAURA: Yeah, this is coming out this week, and
then we've got more merch coming out for the

119
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:16,119
holidays. So you know, keep your eye on the shop.
You don't have to, I'll be announcing it. You

120
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:20,131
don't have to. Yeah, I have enough for all of us
to take.

121
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:23,403
LIAM: Taliesin, may I use the V.A.T.S. system this
evening?

122
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:27,238
TALIESIN: I'll allow it.

123
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:32,999
TRAVIS: Where did that come from? Oh shit!

124
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:38,508
LAURA: You are so fancy! I don't even have a
Portal gun, and he's got two guns!

125
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:45,731
LIAM: This was a Nerf gun that I got on Etsy,
painted by some charming fellow or a lass.

126
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:48,306
TALIESIN: This whole game is going to feel so
horribly wrong with that accent.

127
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:53,612
LIAM: Oh, the teeth are coming out. I cannot do
the whole night with the teeth, no way.

128
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:59,042
TALIESIN: I'm not going to fight it. The Critical
Role podcast is up on iTunes, Google, and

129
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:03,785
geekandsundry.com. We're up to apparently episode
55. I know! That's a lot!

130
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,367
LIAM: We've done that many episodes?

131
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:10,501
TALIESIN: We've done over a hundred now. It
doesn't feel like that, does it? It doesn't make

132
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:16,444
any sense. I know, slouching toward the end.

133
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,042
LIAM: Thanks, Pac-Murderer.

134
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:25,005
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. It's also available on
Amazon Alexa, which I haven't quite figured out

135
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:27,628
what that means yet, but I'm fascinated by the
notion of this.

136
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:30,100
SAM: Wait, so I can say-- We've talked about this
before.

137
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,229
TALIESIN: We've talked about this. We did a whole
gag.

138
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,518
SAM: I could say, "Alexa, play Critical Role." I'm
going to do it tonight.

139
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:36,929
LAURA: What? Really? It might work?

140
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:41,550
TALIESIN: "Open Critical Role." If you have one,
you can simply ask Alexa to "open Critical Role.

141
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:51,446
"Alexa, open Critical Role." I don't have one. A
lot of people are really angry at me now. I hope

142
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:57,685
so. Second issue of the comic book has come out.
It's amazing and it's fabulous, and you two are

143
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:07,481
adorable. It's great. Let's see, what else have we
got here? You and Marisha did a thing that got

144
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,827
released today.

145
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:16,013
LIAM: Oh my god, yeah! Sagas of Sundry: Madness!
Came out.

146
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:20,563
TRAVIS: The tongue lick after each sibilant is the
best.

147
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:28,131
LIAM: There's too much extra shit with them! Too
much wax. I'll try again another year. Yeah, Sagas

148
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:34,493
of Sundry: Madness. Ivan led us on a fucking wild
ride and scared the shit out of me a little bit,

149
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:35,535
initially.

150
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:39,903
TALIESIN: I haven't seen the prequel yet, but I
saw some footage and it looked pretty intense.

151
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:44,717
LIAM: Came together real good. Real good. Should
definitely try it. It's on Project Alpha now.

152
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:48,355
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a little trailer on
YouTube that went up today if you want to get a

153
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:55,709
glimpse. If you want to get an idea of what the
thing looks like, the preview episode of the first

154
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:01,408
season is available on Twitch. You can find that
and see if you like the idea of people using a

155
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,893
giant wooden tower to play a game. It's pretty
cool.

156
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:06,871
LIAM: Oh, it was nerve-wracking! And it's
Halloween, so it's timely.

157
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,828
LAURA: It's hot in here, so my cake is melting.

158
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:11,893
SAM: Can we eat it?

159
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:13,699
LAURA: Yeah, we can totally eat it at the break!

160
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,972
TALIESIN: Next week, I'm not running another
Vampire game because this is stressful and I need

161
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:24,497
to take a vacation. Let's be honest, it's because
this is stressful and I need to take a vacation.

162
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:29,166
Boy, am I really looking forward to being on the
other side of this piece of wood.

163
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,019
LIAM: Why do you think the Mercers went around the
planet?

164
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,761
TALIESIN: Man, I would escape to another continent
myself.

165
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,043
SAM: I think you mean the Rays.

166
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,392
LIAM: They're kicking it in Australia right now,
having a blast.

167
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:42,227
TRAVIS: New one of these next week.

168
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:46,577
SAM: Yeah, what are we doing next week? Are we
announcing that? One-shot?

169
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,539
TALIESIN: I choose you, Pikachu.

170
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,485
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm doing a one-shot.

171
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,362
SAM: Travis Willingham one-shot.

172
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:56,216
TRAVIS: Or rather, Grog is running a one-shot.

173
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,781
SAM: That is a high-concept piece.

174
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:06,167
TRAVIS: Grog's game-night comes next week, where
we will all play Bunions and Flagons.

175
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:11,059
SAM: That could be a disaster.

176
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,986
LIAM: Big math night.

177
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,115
TRAVIS: Lots of algebra, trigonometry.

178
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,240
LAURA: So we're playing as our characters, playing
a game.

179
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,635
TRAVIS: Yep. A game within a game, if you dare.

180
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:28,427
LAURA: So all we have to do is outsmart Grog?

181
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:38,048
TRAVIS: Pretty much. But he is the game master,
so. Nothing to worry about. Everyone's totally

182
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,133
safe and fine. And you're alive, by the way.

183
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,103
LIAM: Not even thinking about it, I'm just taken
by how handsome you look tonight.

184
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:50,118
TRAVIS: Oh, good! Thanks! I killed a bunch of
clickers to get here. There were some cannibals.

185
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:53,073
But the Fireflies are on my six, so we should get
started.

186
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:58,310
TALIESIN: You should not wear makeup more often. I
think it really brings out your-- You have a

187
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,518
natural glow to yourself right now.

188
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:04,352
LIAM: Don't worry about going gray, because it's
working.

189
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:08,823
TRAVIS: It makes me look far wiser than I actually
am. I can reverse math all day.

190
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:12,941
TALIESIN: So to keep things moving, because
apparently I should do that even though I'm really

191
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:19,565
enjoying this: there's no Talks Machina this
Tuesday because it's Halloween. Instead of Talks

192
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:27,113
Machina, you're going to enjoy Eric Campbell's
Cthulhu one-shot on the 7:00-10:00 time. Our

193
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:31,765
Wednesday Club this week is going to be Japanese
influence on American comics with Erika Ishii,

194
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:36,792
which should be fun. Tomorrow, we are doing our
first little Halloween fun with Gather Your Treats

195
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:45,693
on Gather Your Party. You're going to see my real
Halloween costume, which is not on theme with this

196
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:50,667
episode. Oh, it's fancy as fuck. It's bad.

197
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,149
LIAM: I feel fancy as fuck.

198
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,881
TALIESIN: You look fancy as fuck.

199
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,262
LAURA: You're like, Fallout Glamor.

200
00:13:56,262 --> 00:14:02,686
LIAM: Yeah, we got a map tonight, so we're fine.
There's Geek & Sundry right there. There's the

201
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:05,615
Burbank Airport. Let me check my data. Oh, it's
all the secrets!

202
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:10,115
TALIESIN: So I apologize, things are going to be a
little weird tonight. I've got some tech things

203
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:14,266
that I'm still figuring out. But in the meantime,
I think that's the end of announcements.

204
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:18,842
LIAM: Oh nope! There's one last little thing.
Starting next week, we're going to be doing a

205
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:26,923
last, final round of Vox Machina character
playlists. Whoa. Not everybody's ready. Mine is

206
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:30,825
ready, so we'll start with me. Probably Keyleth
after that, and then we'll figure out from there.

207
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:33,507
TALIESIN: I've got, like, half of one. I'll finish
it up.

208
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:37,009
LAURA: Yeah, I've got some really good songs, but
I don't have all my songs.

209
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,599
LIAM: Well, you've got about three or four weeks
to figure that out.

210
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,534
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. I've got plenty of time.

211
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:48,610
TRAVIS: We do have one extra announcement. I
forgot. November 17th, some of us will be

212
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:55,181
attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. There
will be Matt and Marisha. Taliesin. Liam will be

213
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,292
making it. Laura and I will be in Australia,
unfortunately.

214
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,362
LAURA: Yes, at Supanova, come see!

215
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:04,332
TRAVIS: Sam can't make it, but the four of them
will be intrepidly braving the Philadelphia PAX

216
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,577
Unplugged. You're such a goober.

217
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:11,848
They'll be there. You can see them Friday
night. There will be two things. Let's make sure

218
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:17,260
that I have this right. 1:00-2:30pm Eastern
Standard Time is the Critical Role panel and then

219
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,197
the signing will be 5:30-7:30 Eastern Standard
Time. PAX Unplugged on Friday. Info should be on

220
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:27,930
the website. If it changes stay tuned. If you're
in that area, come out, throw things at them

221
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,774
because we won't be there.

222
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:34,695
TALIESIN: Encouraging all sorts of bad behavior.
We'll see if you live through the night. That'll

223
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:42,474
be cool. I think it's time for us to take a moment
and prepare ourselves so I can get a bit of my

224
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:52,437
aggravation and pent-up frustration out on you as
we start to pick up tonight's episode of Thursday

225
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:57,461
by Midnight Part Two. And again thank you to White
Wolf and to Onyx for everything they've done and

226
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:02,225
I'll talk a little bit about that during the game.
Thank you guys so much and let's roll the game.

227
00:16:02,225 --> 00:17:35,764
[dramatic music]

228
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:43,905
TALIESIN: That delighted me, that didn't really
throw me, it was just pleasing. When we last left

229
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:55,444
the game-- That's weird to say. We had just dove
underneath the Wednesday Club table into a

230
00:17:55,444 --> 00:18:08,903
mysterious hole in the back of the studio just in
time to see fire and air pressure push everything,

231
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:16,430
bedlam and sounds and screams and fire above us
and thankfully you had gotten to cover underneath

232
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:23,966
the table and whatever's going on up there, there's
still terrible commotion. You can hear things

233
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:31,714
falling, you can hear things breaking and
shredding and the fires are obviously spreading.

234
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:36,699
You can feel the heat pushing through the table.
But thankfully there seems to be some sort of

235
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,108
break in the floor.

236
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,623
LAURA: I found it!

237
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,499
TALIESIN: You did find it.

238
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,327
SAM: Good job, vampire Laura.

239
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:51,363
TALIESIN: And this perhaps is how somebody got
access to this building, I don't know. Right now

240
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:57,220
you've got about ten feet of clearance on the
little cap that's keeping the fire at bay. A

241
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,076
couple of you are still a little hungry.

242
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,435
LAURA: Just a little hungry.

243
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:03,323
SAM: I'm not hungry.

244
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:04,791
LAURA: You're sup-- oh, oh!

245
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,971
TALIESIN: You're fine at the moment.

246
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:06,887
SAM: Yeah.

247
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:11,414
LAURA: Maybe, you guys, should I sneak ahead?
Should I obfuscate ahead?

248
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:14,419
TRAVIS: Obfuscate? I don't think you used that
term correctly.

249
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,889
LAURA: Obfuscate?

250
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,819
TRAVIS: That means you vanish, but you've got
to hold still right?

251
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:19,348
LAURA: No.

252
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:24,848
SAM: Can we talk for a second about who was that
up there? Gary Gygax?

253
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:29,042
TRAVIS: Yeah. And to our rescue came Matthew
Colville.

254
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,016
SAM: Matthew Colville.

255
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:33,302
Was he undead? Or was he just a man?

256
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,602
LIAM: I think he was a vamp.

257
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:35,724
LAURA and SAM: Was he?

258
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,971
TALIESIN: He may have been a vamp, or maybe he was
just a really good guy. You don't know.

259
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,423
TRAVIS: Did he have claws?

260
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:45,539
TALIESIN: He did have claws, briefly. There was
some slight claw. You would have noticed that.

261
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,691
LIAM: And Gary Gygax, beloved for inventing our
cherished game. I'm a snaggle tooth now.

262
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,601
LAURA: You just took one out?

263
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,341
LIAM: I just took one out, sure. For now. I'll
change it, it'll be different teeth at different

264
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:03,645
times. Sometimes there will be none, sometimes
there will be both. Let's make it none. And Gygax

265
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:08,551
had very long protruding fingers, like obscenely
long fingers, right?

266
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:13,092
LAURA: Does that mean he's like, an old vampire?
Like, he's been a vampire a really long time?

267
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:16,182
LIAM: I don't know. I talk into a can for a
living, I don't know.

268
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:22,346
SAM: You, Liam O'Brien, know all sorts of stuff
about vampires. I, Sam Riegel, do not.

269
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:27,486
LIAM: I saw The Lost Boys, that doesn't tell me
anything about vampires. It's in the movies.

270
00:20:27,486 --> 00:20:29,071
SAM: I didn't even see Interview With A Vampire.

271
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,327
LAURA: It was so good.

272
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:31,238
SAM: Was it?

273
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:32,157
LAURA: Yeah.

274
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:35,933
LIAM: Guys, we are going to die or undie or
something, can we focus in on what are we going to

275
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,426
do? Dani's dead.

276
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:42,132
LAURA: We don't know that they're all dead, we
just know the Twitch studio has exploded. For all we

277
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:46,589
know, the rest of Legendary is still there.

278
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,873
SAM: Well, we're not going back there now, it blew
up.

279
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,053
LAURA: Fuck, no.

280
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,977
TRAVIS: Is the tunnel backup blocked by debris and
other--

281
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:53,816
TALIESIN: To go back up?

282
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:54,720
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

283
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,547
TALIESIN: You can't tell, but you're welcome to
find out.

284
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,111
TRAVIS: Well jesus, Taliesin.

285
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:03,519
LIAM: Does my iPhone have any service?

286
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,197
TALIESIN: If you recall, you got buried without
your iPhones last time.

287
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:11,940
TRAVIS: Oh that's right. We didn't have our phones
in the first place. So that thing on your wrist is--

288
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,091
TALIESIN: You're going to have to read a book like
somebody from the olden days now.

289
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:21,011
TRAVIS: Being that I have heightened senses, what
can I see in our new under the earth situation?

290
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:28,366
TALIESIN: Just because I feel like being a bit of
a jerk, if you're going to use your heightened

291
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,626
senses just burn a hunger.

292
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,008
TRAVIS: Okay.

293
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:35,538
TALIESIN: Actually, give me a hunger roll, I'm
going to do something different. Just roll a d10,

294
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:36,653
tell me what you get.

295
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:37,860
TRAVIS: Just a red d10?

296
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,317
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a red d10.

297
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,346
TRAVIS: Six.

298
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,591
TALIESIN: All right, you're fine.

299
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,457
TRAVIS: A six and above is a success right?

300
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,646
LAURA: I have to remember, yeah I have to remember
what is--

301
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:48,101
TALIESIN: Six and above is a success, and then
you'll always have to roll your red dice. You can

302
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,436
lose them and gain them.

303
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,925
LIAM: This is a really character-heavy question.
Does anyone have an extra pencil?

304
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:53,974
TRAVIS: Yep.

305
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:56,077
LIAM: No!

306
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:57,916
LAURA: No, don't throw things!

307
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:06,482
TALIESIN: This tunnel that you're in, from what you
can see, somebody burrowed somehow. Some creature

308
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:14,513
made this. And it's just big enough for like about
two people. And it goes down into a larger tunnel

309
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,875
directly below you. It's like a little offset.

310
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,832
LAURA: Do we hear any sounds coming from the
tunnel?

311
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:20,595
TALIESIN: Do you hear sounds coming from the iPad?
Let me find out.

312
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:26,475
TRAVIS: Do we see any slime or hair or anything
that's like "Oh this is a--?"

313
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:31,923
TALIESIN: You can hear the faint distant
sound of a little bit of water, a little moisture

314
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:38,296
and it's a big tunnel so down there it could be
anything. There's definitely some sound down there.

315
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,535
SAM: We can't go back up, it exploded.

316
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,650
LAURA: No, our only choice is to travel
underground.

317
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,535
LIAM: You should probably do that obfuscate thing
that you've talked about.

318
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:47,672
LAURA: I want to.

319
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:52,475
TRAVIS: Or, or we can do the thing that we've
learned from being Vox Machina for so long. Who's

320
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,964
super fast, like the Flash?

321
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:54,756
SAM: I am.

322
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:58,722
TRAVIS: Yeah, you should run ahead, dart ahead of
all of the rest of us and check it out.

323
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:04,721
SAM: But I, unlike Vax from Vox Machina, don't
have darkvision. Do we have anything that glows?

324
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:05,913
LAURA: We can see.

325
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,549
TALIESIN: You can see okay. You can't see as well
as he can.

326
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,209
SAM: All right.

327
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:13,407
LIAM: Is above sealed? Help me visualize what's
above us.

328
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:17,547
TALIESIN: So above you, you're down in a little
bit of a tunnel and it's at a bit of an angle and

329
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:25,288
the basically giant circular manhole that is that
table has stamped down and seems to be pressured

330
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:26,384
down at the moment.

331
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:27,839
LIAM: So we're not getting any firelight or
anything?

332
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,763
TALIESIN: No, you're feeling some heat but you're
not getting any firelight.

333
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:33,287
LIAM: I'm not seeing anything.

334
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,514
TALIESIN: He can kind of see something, and
there's a little light coming from the bottom of

335
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,244
the tunnel. There's just enough to make out
some--

336
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:40,787
TRAVIS: There's just enough light coming from the
bottom of the tunnel?

337
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,629
TALIESIN: Just at the very bottom there's enough.

338
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,306
LIAM: Definitely Sam or Laura or Travis should go
ahead.

339
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:49,592
TRAVIS: I think that's a good idea.

340
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:53,109
LAURA: I think that's a really good idea, Liam.
You should stay here and be safe.

341
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,015
TRAVIS: Good call. Yeah, I'm glad we agree.

342
00:23:56,015 --> 00:23:58,850
LIAM: Let the brain hang back and figure shit out,
right?

343
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,854
TRAVIS: I will kill him first.

344
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,406
SAM: Do you want me to go down there?

345
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,571
LAURA: Do it, go so fast.

346
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:14,174
SAM: I'm going to go so fast and dart ahead like
40 feet.

347
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,512
TALIESIN: You're going to go so fast like PacMan?

348
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:17,661
SAM: Yeah.

349
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,520
TALIESIN: All right.

350
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,269
LAURA: Or I could sneak down because people can't
see me if I do it well.

351
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:22,608
TRAVIS: Yeah, either one of two.

352
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:23,873
SAM: Maybe we should do that.

353
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:24,903
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that.

354
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:27,228
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that. He's not going
to go fast, I'm going to sneak in.

355
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:31,208
TALIESIN: You have to do a roll, don't you, or do
you just have to--

356
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,915
LAURA: I'll go caw caw.

357
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:38,182
TALIESIN: Oh, no you don't, you're fine. Roll a
d10, tell me what you get.

358
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:39,506
LAURA: The red?

359
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:40,728
TALIESIN: Yeah.

360
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:41,952
LAURA: Two.

361
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:46,945
TALIESIN: You get one point of hunger. You're
fine, you're going to do it, but here have a--

362
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,617
LAURA: I get hungrier, but I can do it.

363
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:49,713
TALIESIN: You get a little hungrier.

364
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:50,940
LAURA: Okay.

365
00:24:50,940 --> 00:25:00,805
TALIESIN: But yeah, so you sneak down and the
tunnel is larger than you'd expect. It's 12 feet

366
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:02,192
in diameter.

367
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,781
LAURA: Okay. I got hungrier, so I've got to put my
fangs back in you guys.

368
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:05,743
SAM: Sure.

369
00:25:05,743 --> 00:25:14,437
TALIESIN: It's a carved out tunnel, but not a
technically carved tunnel. There's like some

370
00:25:14,437 --> 00:25:22,967
animals that burrowed this big hole but 
did it very well. Something made this with some

371
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:29,383
skill, but it's not modern. There's something
weirdly ancient and a little unsettling about the

372
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:34,570
whole tunnel. It's not a sewer. You were
expecting a sewer. It's not there.

373
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,005
LAURA: Does it feel stable?

374
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:41,335
TALIESIN: It looks very stable and it looks like
it's been there a long time.

375
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:42,632
LAURA: What does it smell like?

376
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:50,277
TALIESIN: It smells slightly sour, like the algae
that is growing on the walls, this white

377
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:54,967
crystalline algae that gives off a very gentle
glow.

378
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,691
LAURA: Oh! So I can see!

379
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,075
TALIESIN: Just a hint.

380
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,281
LAURA: I'm going to lick the algae.

381
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:05,747
SAM: Oh god. Last time someone licked something,
tasted something--

382
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:06,818
TALIESIN: You're going to lick the algae?

383
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:09,628
LAURA: Just, like, a little lick.

384
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:10,842
TALIESIN: A little lick the algae?

385
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:12,308
LAURA: Not like a big, big lick.

386
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:14,532
SAM: That looks so gross with the teeth. The
tongue with the-- ugh.

387
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:18,816
TALIESIN: I'm going to say it tastes like algae.

388
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:21,863
LAURA: Hmm. Not like rat droppings?

389
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:29,414
TALIESIN: No. I mean, it tastes awful. It tastes
of putrescense and death and awful. This shit is

390
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:30,732
disgusting.

391
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:33,631
TRAVIS: Well, we know you're fans of rats, but--

392
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:36,297
LAURA: I know. I am.

393
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:38,246
SAM: How's it look down there, Laura?

394
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:42,004
LAURA: Shut up! I keep going forward.

395
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:43,942
LIAM: She's got this.

396
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:45,436
TALIESIN: The tunnel goes down--

397
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:46,542
LAURA: It keeps going?

398
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:50,442
TALIESIN: The tunnel keeps going. You can't see
the end of it.

399
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:56,427
LAURA: Oh. Okay, wait. I go back to them. Follow
behind me, but not right behind me.

400
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,928
TRAVIS: How far behind you?

401
00:26:57,928 --> 00:27:03,185
LAURA: Just, you know, whatever. Like 50
feet behind me. Is that far?

402
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:06,777
TALIESIN: Oh man.

403
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:09,369
LIAM: That's like here to the door out to the--

404
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:16,109
LAURA: Yeah! And then unless I make noise like a
scream or something then you know it's safe, you

405
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,493
can keep coming forward.

406
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:20,677
LIAM: I mean, you're not really human anymore,
you're kind of tough now.

407
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:21,996
LAURA: Yeah, I'm so tough.

408
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:25,220
TRAVIS: We will follow not so closely behind.

409
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,254
SAM, LIAM, and LAURA: Yep.

410
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,595
LIAM: I'll be 51 feet behind.

411
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:29,970
LAURA: And I go back to where I was and keep
walking.

412
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,629
LIAM: Yessir.

413
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:35,946
LAURA: Holy shit, it's like catacombs. Is this
serious?

414
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,169
TALIESIN: This is so serious.

415
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,289
LAURA: This is serious.

416
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,909
SAM: Guys, I took off my shoes and I've got to say
it feels so much better.

417
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,272
LAURA: Yeah?

418
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,884
LIAM: Not doing a good job of quelling the serial
killer thing, Sam.

419
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:51,509
LAURA: You are really creepy looking.

420
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,972
SAM: It's the eyebrows. Well, I put on this part
and I was like it needs something else.

421
00:27:56,972 --> 00:28:01,765
TALIESIN: It's genuinely distracting.

422
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:08,910
TRAVIS: You look like if the clown from Spawn was
trying to be PacMan. Pac McFarlane. PacMan.

423
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:16,642
TALIESIN: You're probably not going to really run
into anything for about a quarter of a mile in

424
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:22,380
going down. And eventually after about a
quarter mile you can see a place where the modern

425
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,557
sewer system has cut through this tunnel. Like
someone hit this and decided to keep going. And so

426
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:35,624
there's a sewer system that's obviously city sewer
although very old. coming out at an angle, hits

427
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:43,409
this tunnel, ignores it and continues in an odd
way. And this tunnel also keeps going around the

428
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:44,807
corner so you can--

429
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:45,768
LAURA: I can choose?

430
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:46,772
TALIESIN: There's some options.

431
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:53,831
LAURA: Okay guys! It intersects with the sewer.
There's got to be so many rats in the sewer.

432
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:56,039
SAM: Oh yeah. You could have a feast!

433
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,181
LAURA: Here's the thing.

434
00:28:58,342 --> 00:28:59,192
SAM: I don't eat rats.

435
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:00,723
LIAM: She doesn't either. You don't eat rats?

436
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:01,856
TRAVIS: You just eat people now.

437
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:03,508
LAURA: Y'all, rats are super good.

438
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,582
LIAM: What do you mean?

439
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:05,957
LAURA: They're like so fucking good.

440
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,239
TRAVIS: Sofa king?

441
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,611
LIAM: Sofa king.

442
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:14,741
LAURA: Sofa king delicious. But here's the thing.
This tunnel intersects with the sewer. We can

443
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:20,120
either continue through this tunnel and try
to figure out, I don't know, why we're

444
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,773
vampires and see if there's some source to this
power or we go to the sewer and we live.

445
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:27,957
TRAVIS: Live there?

446
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,226
SAM: You mean live forever in the sewers?

447
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,174
LAURA: Yeah. We can hide out in the sewers under
LA.

448
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:32,190
SAM: What if we need--

449
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,999
TALIESIN: I'm so into this plan.

450
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:36,790
TRAVIS: What happened to you in that coffin?
We're talking about you.

451
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,351
SAM: Don't you want to solve this? There's got to
be a cure right?

452
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:42,757
LAURA: Look, wait, we're fucked. We're vampires.

453
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:47,216
LIAM: We can but, yeah, let me pitch something
here. Like we're all tired. We have day jobs.

454
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:48,637
SAM: Are we?

455
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,362
LIAM: I am.

456
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:50,442
SAM: Taliesin, are we tired?

457
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:52,693
LIAM: That's not what I'm talking about, I mean in
general.

458
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:53,876
TALIESIN: Liam's tired.

459
00:29:53,876 --> 00:30:02,204
LIAM: We got day jobs. We got night jobs. We work
a lot. We could be princes and queens of death now.

460
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:08,035
SAM: Who's thinking princes and queens of death?
We almost were killed by werewolves and bigger

461
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,146
vampires.

462
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:10,464
LAURA: There's probably other things that are
scary.

463
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:15,599
SAM: We'd be the lowest-- I don't know anything
about vampires, but we could be private first

464
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,685
class vampires.

465
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:18,171
TRAVIS: Wait, didn't a week go by?

466
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:23,095
LIAM: Husbo, you are two hours into being a
vampire, if that. You just learned how to run, who

467
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,531
knows what else you're going to learn?

468
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,360
LAURA: True.

469
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,029
SAM: I also learned that I could kill a man in
seconds flat.

470
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,265
LIAM: That's hot.

471
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:32,992
TRAVIS: Wait, raise your hand if you've killed
somebody? A person?

472
00:30:32,992 --> 00:30:34,561
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, sorry. Carry on.

473
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:37,976
SAM: I killed a person, I don't know what came
over me. It was amazing.

474
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:40,027
LIAM: Did I kill that guy? Did I kill Max when I
ate him?

475
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:42,995
TRAVIS: Yeah. Wait no.

476
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:44,226
SAM: I killed Max.

477
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:47,497
TRAVIS: Oh, you left him for dead. Okay. I'm just
checking to make sure like--

478
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,600
TALIESIN: I think Sam's the only one who's
actually--

479
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,703
TRAVIS: Might be holding onto this for no good
reason.

480
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:58,535
LAURA: Technically I did too, but it's not
important.

481
00:30:58,535 --> 00:30:59,807
LIAM: Who was it?

482
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,318
LAURA: It's just a chick.

483
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,753
SAM: Wait, who did you kill?

484
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,891
LAURA: It's just this chick, up in the Smart
Girls.

485
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:06,298
SAM: Did you know who she was?

486
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,484
LAURA: No I didn't know her, remember we were
there fucking together?

487
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:12,065
SAM: Oh, that girl, yeah. And I guess I probably
caused that other boy to die.

488
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:15,402
LIAM: That's the worst thing to say dressed like
PacMan.

489
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:18,172
SAM: I've killed two people, Travis.

490
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:22,876
TALIESIN: You dress like that, you also eat their ghosts
so they're like the soulless, really. Sorry.

491
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:27,993
LAURA: Look, Travis, not all of us have willpower
like you. I get really hungry and if I don't eat,

492
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,598
I get really angry.

493
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,785
TRAVIS: No, that's the truth, preach. I know.

494
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:40,778
LIAM: And also I'm really shy and awkward right,
but as a vampire it can only get better, right?

495
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:45,568
SAM: So we're just committing? After an hour of
being a vampire we're saying, "You know what, fuck

496
00:31:45,568 --> 00:31:47,127
"it, let's be vampires forever."

497
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,183
LIAM: I mean, I am.

498
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:53,775
LAURA: Here's the thing, we could record at night.
After a few days with these teeth, I think I'll

499
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,333
get used to talking with them.

500
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:59,606
SAM: It's going to really hurt your commercial
auditions.

501
00:31:59,606 --> 00:32:01,682
LAURA: I know but I don't do very many of them.

502
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:03,264
SAM: Really? You have a good commercial voice.

503
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:04,483
LAURA: Really? You think so?

504
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,552
SAM: Yeah, I think so. Young mom.

505
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,696
LAURA: Thanks.

506
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:09,929
SAM: Sure.

507
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,388
TRAVIS: Forever. Let's go see the sewer a little
more closely. I feel weird about this.

508
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,824
LAURA: About what?

509
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:19,041
TRAVIS: Just committing to being-- I don't know if
I want to stay this way.

510
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:22,491
LAURA: I mean we can go, we can keep looking. We
might die.

511
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,841
TRAVIS: I like the sun. It's warm--

512
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,250
SAM: Yeah, sports are played there.

513
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,882
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, there are night games but--

514
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:31,815
LAURA: That's true. You can't swim at the beach
and stuff.

515
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:36,839
TRAVIS: I mean, you can, it's just super dark and
swimming in the ocean at night is scary.

516
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,400
LIAM: There might be underground lakes in here.

517
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
TRAVIS: Yeah.

518
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:45,284
LAURA: You know, in one of the games I did where I
was a vampire, vampires are allergic to water.

519
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:47,267
TRAVIS: All water?

520
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:51,706
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know if that's true or not.
Oh, is there water in the sewer?

521
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,274
TALIESIN: There's a little bit of water in the
sewer.

522
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,996
LAURA: I'm going to wind over and put my hand in
it and let--

523
00:32:54,996 --> 00:33:00,474
TALIESIN: That's disgusting and probably will give
you pink eye. You'll eventually get to find out if

524
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:03,515
vampires get pink eye. I don't know and that's a
question for--

525
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,986
LAURA: Did it hurt though?

526
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,364
TALIESIN: No, it didn't hurt.

527
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,393
LAURA: Okay, then I don't think we're allergic to
water.

528
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:10,416
LIAM: Okay. So we're not Nazgul.

529
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:17,704
Jeez, all kinds of things are changing now.

530
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:22,285
SAM: His vampire powers are amazing. He 
clutched this very warm mug.

531
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:28,196
LAURA: So what do you think? Do you want to go to
the tunnels some more?

532
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:32,024
LIAM: Yeah we've got to progress our lives, our
unlives further so we can't stay here arguing

533
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:33,377
whatever we're going to do.

534
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,421
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to go forward.

535
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:35,588
LIAM: I want to be a vampire.

536
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:36,524
LAURA: You want to stay a vampire?

537
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:37,420
LIAM: I'm fucking in.

538
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,212
TRAVIS: I have amazing senses, I hear everything
that you're saying.

539
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:41,683
LIAM: I'm not hiding this from you, Travis.

540
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,276
TRAVIS: Then why are you directing it towards her
shoulder?

541
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:47,984
SAM: I just touched myself and you didn't know
because I'm so fast that I--

542
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,913
TRAVIS: No, I knew that too.

543
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:51,931
TALIESIN: You also didn't feel it because you're
so fast.

544
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,499
LAURA: Aw, you didn't feel anything.

545
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,284
TALIESIN: No.

546
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,391
SAM: Just adjusted a little bit.

547
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:56,445
TRAVIS: Just a tremor.

548
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:58,410
LIAM: I'm not hiding anything from you. We'll
bring you around.

549
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:03,994
TALIESIN: Since you do have heightened senses, you
can hear some tiny bit of rattling around down one

550
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:07,319
of the sewer tunnels. You can hear some tiny bit
of rattling around further down.

551
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,061
TRAVIS: Oh wait! Shh. I actually hear something
down this way.

552
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:12,884
SAM: Let's go!

553
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,837
LAURA: Should we go to the path?

554
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:14,494
TRAVIS: Yeah.

555
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:15,393
SAM: Are you on point?

556
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:18,366
LAURA: But don't forget, this is where the tunnel
continues on from where Geek and Sundry was.

557
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:20,905
TRAVIS: No, we're going this way.

558
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,090
LAURA: Okay.

559
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,563
TRAVIS: We'll go towards that noise.

560
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:30,990
TALIESIN: You head down. It's about 200 feet
before you get to a sewer lock off where there's

561
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:41,623
an old power box and a small grate system that the
water flows through, but things do not. There are

562
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:53,284
definitely some rats rolling around, and there's a
weird brick square chimney that goes off up into

563
00:34:53,284 --> 00:35:01,222
god knows where and on the side of the wall is a
small lock box/power box with some very old

564
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:04,951
signage on it that's a little hard to read.

565
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:06,728
LIAM: I'll give it a shot.

566
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:12,321
TRAVIS: Can I snag one of the rats and fucking rip
its head off? And squeeze it like a thing of

567
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,468
toothpaste?

568
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:14,942
TALIESIN: Give me a dex brawl.

569
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,637
LIAM: Like an Otter Pop.

570
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:18,153
LAURA: Gross.

571
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:19,582
SAM: Like a Hi-Chew.

572
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:20,794
TALIESIN: Hi-Chew.

573
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:31,064
TRAVIS: Dex brawl. All the dice. Three successes,
two failures. But none of them are red.

574
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:35,186
TALIESIN: Three successes, two failures? Not two
ones though?

575
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:38,201
TRAVIS: Two ones, but they're black ones.

576
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:43,340
TALIESIN: They're black ones. Three successes, two
black ones. It's hard to read the handwriting,

577
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,217
it's a little tricky. Oh no, you were going for
the rat.

578
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:47,999
TRAVIS: I was going for the rat, yeah. Toothpaste
rat.

579
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,299
TALIESIN: You did not grab the rat.

580
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:50,277
TRAVIS: Damn it!

581
00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:51,297
TALIESIN: The rat got away.

582
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:55,362
TRAVIS: Fuck! I should have eaten somebody. I'm so
hungry, I've got all these red dice.

583
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:58,150
LIAM: Let's read the handwriting.

584
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,472
TALIESIN: Yeah! Give me a perception awareness.

585
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,458
LIAM: A perception and awareness. That's not bad.

586
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:03,421
TALIESIN: No.

587
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,970
LIAM: That's not bad. Let's see.

588
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,000
LAURA: Can I try to get a rat? Because I'm really
good at it now.

589
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,814
TALIESIN: Dex and athletics.

590
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:16,271
LIAM: I did really well in school. Except that's
cocked. I should just take the six. So I got an X,

591
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:27,099
I got a one on the red, and an eight. One, two,
three. Three successes and one--

592
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,450
TALIESIN: And one blood failure.

593
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,990
LIAM: Yeah.

594
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:42,519
TALIESIN: It's really hard to read. Somebody
scratched this in. It takes you a minute. It does

595
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,069
say "sanctuary."

596
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,381
LIAM: It says skanktuary.

597
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:55,794
TALIESIN: Skanktuary. With a little arrow facing
the way you came and either a cross or a T or

598
00:36:55,794 --> 00:37:01,499
something below it. And the box has definitely
been broken into. There used to be a lock on the

599
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:04,469
box, but the lock is broken. What did you roll?

600
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,883
LAURA: I rolled two successes.

601
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:08,684
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you got it. Give me a blood die
back.

602
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,980
LAURA: Yay! Can I try to catch one for Travis?

603
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,268
TALIESIN: Yes you can.

604
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:14,183
LAURA: Is it Dex brawl again?

605
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:15,483
TALIESIN: Dex brawl.

606
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:21,291
LAURA: Whoa! Critical success!

607
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,252
TALIESIN: Very nice.

608
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,010
LAURA: Oh, but I got a one on one of my red.

609
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,336
TALIESIN: It takes you a minute, but you get one.
You get a nice big one for Travis. So you can--

610
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:30,721
TRAVIS: I can get rid of one of these?

611
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:31,697
TALIESIN: You can get rid of one of these.

612
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:32,735
TRAVIS: Yes!

613
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:36,919
TRAVIS: (gulping and slurping)

614
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,209
TALIESIN: It makes a bit of a mess.

615
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:40,565
LIAM: That is disgusting.

616
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:41,680
TRAVIS: What? I'm trying to embrace it.

617
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,957
LIAM: I'll wait for a person, thanks. This says
"Sanctuary."

618
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:46,828
LAURA: I can make rat hamburgers.

619
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:51,396
LIAM: And we know that shit was going on in this
building for a while before we were let in on it.

620
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:58,561
So I don't know. Maybe a hideout that's been under
here for a while that we didn't know? While vamps

621
00:37:58,561 --> 00:37:59,505
were getting--

622
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:00,895
LAURA: I'm less hungry, I can take my teeth out.

623
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:04,315
SAM: That's what you've established now?

624
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,826
LAURA: Never mind, they won't come out. I'm stuck
like this.

625
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,043
LIAM: Yes you are.

626
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,115
TRAVIS: Forever.

627
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:13,078
SAM: Is there a way to continue on down the sewer
path or that's it?

628
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:18,518
TALIESIN: There's some attempts you could make,
but the sewer path is definitely treacherous at

629
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:19,559
this point.

630
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,519
SAM: All right, let's turn around.

631
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,647
LAURA: Let's go to the sanctuary.

632
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:22,925
TRAVIS: Okay.

633
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,961
SAM: If we follow the arrow where the sanctuary
was pointing.

634
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:27,440
TALIESIN: Further down that old tunnel?

635
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,694
SAM: Yeah.

636
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:29,976
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

637
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:42,300
TALIESIN: All right. This tunnel goes on for a
long time. What would I call this? If anyone wants

638
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,318
to make another perception awareness.

639
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,380
LAURA: I will!

640
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,103
LIAM: I will. Okay, Laura's going first.

641
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:49,395
TRAVIS: Oh, me too because I'm actually perceptive
for once.

642
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:50,914
SAM: I don't give a shit.

643
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,759
TALIESIN: You don't give a shit and that's fine,
that's PacMan life.

644
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:58,309
LAURA: Oh shit. Two successes, one fail.

645
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:02,605
TALIESIN: One one? Okay.

646
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:03,693
TRAVIS: Two successes.

647
00:39:03,693 --> 00:39:04,795
TALIESIN: Was it a blood one? Okay.

648
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:05,958
TRAVIS: Two successes, no failures.

649
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:12,264
TALIESIN: You've been paying some attention,
trying to figure out your direction and where

650
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:16,801
you're going and how long you've been walking. You
are starting to go under Mulholland.

651
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:18,163
TRAVIS: Whoa.

652
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:20,031
SAM: Under Mulholland?

653
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:24,504
TALIESIN: You're heading towards the Hills. You're
getting awful close to it. It's been a couple

654
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:31,397
miles you've been walking underneath this
underground tunnel, this really old tunnel.

655
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:36,415
TRAVIS: Is there any pavers or anything in this
tunnel or does it still look like it was burrowed?

656
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:40,275
Like rudimenti-larily.

657
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:47,010
TALIESIN: Since you had a decent perception: it's
burrowed, but there's some very specific scratch

658
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:54,031
marks since you've gotten a little further on.
There starts to be some rudimentary, like almost a

659
00:39:54,031 --> 00:39:58,545
hobo code is what I would call it? There's little
symbols that have been left that obviously mean

660
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:03,850
something but you don't know what they mean.
Somebody's been in here.

661
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,705
TRAVIS: We're making pretty good distance, I think
we're close to Mullholland.

662
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,267
LAURA: Really?

663
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:10,419
SAM: That's far.

664
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:11,765
LAURA: That's really far.

665
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:17,399
LIAM: Listen, when I was a teenager in New Jersey,
my first job was working for the Department of

666
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:25,723
Public Works, no joke, and we cleaned up after
homeless folk, okay. Can I try and read the hobo code?

667
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,683
TALIESIN: You can.

668
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,402
SAM: You're proficient in hobo?

669
00:40:29,402 --> 00:40:30,410
LIAM: Yeah.

670
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,216
TALIESIN: I'll give that intelligence academics.

671
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:35,799
LIAM: Okay. Ooh! Okay.

672
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,458
SAM: This marking means "can of beans."

673
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:46,468
LIAM: Yeah, we cleaned up and once I found some
nasty old mattresses with some magazines. Some

674
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:47,938
smelly things.

675
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,525
TALIESIN: I was not expecting someone to go for
the hobo code.

676
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:53,345
LIAM: Right underneath Hamilton Park.

677
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:57,680
SAM: What if these are taggers?

678
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,059
LIAM: Oh, no.

679
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:00,281
TRAVIS: Taggers?

680
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:01,306
SAM: Taggers.

681
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:06,569
LIAM: One success. Only one success and one
failure on a blood die.

682
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,648
LAURA: Well, but, no-- oh, that's a five.

683
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,878
LIAM: I didn't roll that.

684
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:14,500
TALIESIN: There are worse things in the world than
one failure on a blood die. Two failures on a

685
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,984
blood die is a problem.

686
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:18,719
LIAM: Yeah. Like dirty magazines on a mattress,
that's worse.

687
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,806
TALIESIN: You end up at the back of the group,
because you're staring at this stuff, and it's not

688
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:26,667
ringing a bell at all. This is weird.

689
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,974
LIAM: It is taking me home, though.

690
00:41:27,974 --> 00:41:34,099
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're drifting a little bit. I
mean, you're a little cloudy, you're not all there.

691
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,524
LIAM: It's good, I'm going to leave it behind,
because I've got a new future now.

692
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,746
SAM: What's our endgame here? We've been walking
for miles.

693
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:43,773
TRAVIS: Well, we can't go back the way we came,
we've got to find a way out, at least.

694
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:51,151
SAM: Are there any other tunnels? Or any other
peeks up into the daylight, or up top?

695
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:56,683
TALIESIN: Just the glow of the algae. Travis, roll
just perception.

696
00:41:56,683 --> 00:42:03,239
TRAVIS: Okay, just perception. That is a crit. Two
tens.

697
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:12,943
TALIESIN: There is something right above. There is
a creature.

698
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:15,134
TRAVIS: In the tunnel with us?

699
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:17,894
TALIESIN: In the tunnel with you, directly above
you.

700
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:20,044
LIAM: Why do you look like that? What's wrong with
you?

701
00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:22,502
SAM: What's up, Travis?

702
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:30,270
TALIESIN: It's very thin, it's the same color as
the walls, it's almost camouflaged perfectly, and

703
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,646
it's vaguely reptilian.

704
00:42:33,646 --> 00:42:39,930
TRAVIS: There's-- there is-- Don't look up,
there's--

705
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,839
SAM: Speak in code, speak in pig latin.

706
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,601
TRAVIS: (incoherent mumbling) There's something
above us, and it's reptilian looking.

707
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,935
LAURA: I look up.

708
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,170
TALIESIN: You look up?

709
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,049
LAURA: Yeah.

710
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:55,248
LIAM: I'm backing away.

711
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,751
SAM: I'm drawing my XLR whip.

712
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:02,336
TALIESIN: It goes scurrying at high speed when you
look up.

713
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:04,907
LAURA: Forward or back?

714
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:09,400
TALIESIN: Back from the direction you came. It
darts back there.

715
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,753
SAM: I'm going.

716
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:11,731
TALIESIN: You're going for it?

717
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:13,221
SAM: Yes, I take off after it.

718
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,878
TALIESIN: What level of Celerity are you?

719
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:16,452
LAURA: What is it?

720
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:17,749
TALIESIN: Some sort of lizard.

721
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,531
LAURA: A lizard? Like a person lizard?

722
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,046
TALIESIN: Something lizardy.

723
00:43:21,046 --> 00:43:23,707
SAM: It says you are capable of an incredibly fast
response time.

724
00:43:23,707 --> 00:43:25,829
TALIESIN: So, you're using Celerity two, right?

725
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:27,279
SAM: I don't know, what does that mean?

726
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:28,462
TRAVIS: Yeah, Celerity.

727
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:33,502
TALIESIN: Celerity two. I'm looking at the wrong
thing, here we go. I'm trying to be good about this.

728
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:36,601
SAM: May use your dodge skill against firearms,
you don't suffer penalties--

729
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:40,045
TALIESIN: So, you can actually climb vertical
surfaces with Celerity Two.

730
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:45,952
SAM: I have Grace that makes me climb any vertical
surface no matter how slippery or flimsy.

731
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:48,257
TALIESIN: Make a hunger roll. Roll a d10.

732
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,856
SAM: Just 1d10?

733
00:43:49,856 --> 00:43:51,064
TALIESIN: Just 1d10.

734
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:52,125
SAM: One.

735
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,970
TALIESIN: Okay, burn a hunger, so you're about to
get--

736
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,677
SAM: No, I have plenty, you don't need to give me
any more, I've got five over here.

737
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:03,575
TALIESIN: Do you have five? I thought 
you weren't hungry at all?

738
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:06,616
SAM: I'm just not giving them back to you when I'm
done because that's silly.

739
00:44:06,616 --> 00:44:09,532
TALIESIN: Okay, well, fine. I marked them all up
and made them all pretty for this.

740
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:12,044
SAM: What do I? Do I roll one of these?

741
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:16,380
TALIESIN: Well you did, and you just got an extra
one, so you're now at one hunger and you're

742
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,497
peckish.

743
00:44:18,497 --> 00:44:21,403
SAM: But I don't catch him, or what?

744
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:22,748
TALIESIN: You do catch him.

745
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:23,511
SAM: Oh.

746
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:31,516
TALIESIN: You are fast and you climb up the wall
and you come in contact with a humanoid lizard,

747
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:38,879
who turns, looks at you with big, gold eyes, and
(hissing screech).

748
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:42,423
SAM: I will try to grapple him.

749
00:44:42,423 --> 00:44:43,864
TALIESIN: You can do that.

750
00:44:43,864 --> 00:44:52,438
SAM: With my mic cable, I'm going to try and wrap
it around his snout, so he can't open his snout.

751
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:54,678
TALIESIN: Here we are, roll strength brawl.

752
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:58,577
SAM: Strength brawl, that's my forte. Oh, boy.

753
00:44:58,577 --> 00:45:01,383
LIAM: There will be brawl.

754
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:04,213
SAM: Three successes.

755
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:16,943
TALIESIN: Three successes? Yep, you grab onto a
leg and you've got a flailing angry lizard person

756
00:45:16,943 --> 00:45:18,592
currently grappled.

757
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,547
TRAVIS: We're all giving chase, we're trying to
catch up.

758
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:22,847
SAM: I'm trying to hog tie him while I say: get
over here! I need help!

759
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:26,988
TALIESIN: (hissing) "Let go! Let go!"

760
00:45:26,988 --> 00:45:28,734
SAM: Oh! He talks!

761
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,967
LAURA: (gasping) Oh my god, what is it? Can we eat
it?

762
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:35,319
TALIESIN: You turn so quick, god.

763
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,370
SAM: I think we like warm blood, we like mammals.

764
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,924
LAURA: Oh.

765
00:45:39,924 --> 00:45:41,678
LIAM: I'm following, too, but not that fast.

766
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:45,683
SAM: I'm going to try to tie him more secure.

767
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:49,559
TALIESIN: Just for fun, give me one more strength
brawl.

768
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,021
LAURA, LIAM, and TRAVIS: Ooh.

769
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:53,440
SAM: Two successes, one fail.

770
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,680
TALIESIN: Two successes, one fail? Is the fail on
the red?

771
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,824
SAM: Yes, it's a blood die.

772
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:58,356
TALIESIN: How do you keep doing that? Oh, is it a
fail or a one?

773
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,310
SAM: It's a one.

774
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,496
TALIESIN: It's a one, okay.

775
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:01,613
TRAVIS: That means you get another--

776
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:08,101
TALIESIN: No, that means I can maybe-- you were
very lucky. Yep, he's not doing well with you.

777
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:10,530
SAM: Hog tying him. I went to a rodeo once.

778
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,316
TRAVIS: I'm pretty fast, could I get there and try
and help?

779
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:19,928
TALIESIN: How long has it been? It's been two--
yeah, you're there by then. He didn't get very

780
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:21,792
far. Celerity is mean.

781
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:25,812
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that thing?!

782
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:27,366
SAM: I don't know, it talks, who are you, what are
you?

783
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:29,662
TALIESIN: (hissing monster noises) "Let go!"

784
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,445
SAM: We'll unhand you if you tell us who and what
you are.

785
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:39,561
TALIESIN: "My name is Lock. This is <i>my</i> tunnel.
No vampires!"

786
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:41,999
LAURA: Oh shit.

787
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,296
TRAVIS: His name's Slock?

788
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,591
SAM: Or lock. Or rock.

789
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:46,152
TALIESIN: "Lock."

790
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:49,060
LIAM: You guys doing okay down there?

791
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,798
SAM: No?

792
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:52,716
LAURA: Stay back Liam, it's too dangerous.

793
00:46:52,716 --> 00:46:53,960
LIAM: Good call.

794
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,185
SAM: This is your tunnel? We just became vampires
an hour ago.

795
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:04,664
TALIESIN: (hissing) "Vampires? Two weeks in my
tunnel, two weeks!"

796
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:07,123
LAURA: How long have you been here?

797
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:11,940
TALIESIN: "We've always been here."

798
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,876
SAM: Oh god.

799
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:16,002
LAURA: They're the lizard people of Los Angeles!

800
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:19,391
SAM: I knew they were true!

801
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:22,028
TALIESIN: I am genuinely amazed that you actually
know that there are lizard people beneath the--

802
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:24,923
TRAVIS: Yes! Of course, man. The rest are in DC.

803
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:31,307
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. That is some deep LA myth,
man. Okay.

804
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:39,715
TRAVIS: We want to let you go, we don't mean you
any direct harm, but we need to know how to get

805
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:41,151
out of this tunnel.

806
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,498
SAM: How long does the tunnel go? Where can we
find an exit?

807
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:45,098
LAURA: How can we not be vampires anymore?

808
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:49,667
TRAVIS: We're going to eat him. "I don't want to
be a vampire." We're going to eat him.

809
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:53,337
TALIESIN: "What's wrong with you people?"

810
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:59,760
SAM: We're new at this. You've been here for what,
a millennia or something? We've been vampires for

811
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,709
I guess two weeks, right?

812
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:03,124
LAURA: Ish.

813
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:12,551
TALIESIN: "I twice have been beneath cities since
its inception. For thousands of years we have

814
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:15,642
"lived-- You are supposed to know this."

815
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,992
LAURA: We don't know anything.

816
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:19,949
TALIESIN: "We had an arrangement with you."

817
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:26,883
TRAVIS: We're literally hours into this thing, we
don't mean any offense.

818
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:34,303
SAM: No one guided us through the change. We had
no bar mitzvah or whatever you call it.

819
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,687
TALIESIN: "You people are way too pitiful to be
vampires."

820
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:39,585
TRAVIS: Okay, hold it, take it easy.

821
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:44,749
SAM: We have powers, all right? Look at this. And
I walk up around the tunnel, like in a

822
00:48:44,749 --> 00:48:46,455
loop-de-loop.

823
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:48,249
TALIESIN: "I can do that. I don't really--"

824
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:49,516
SAM: Yeah, but I'm not a lizard.

825
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:52,087
LAURA: Yeah, but what about this?

826
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:54,170
TALIESIN: That doesn't work if we're actually
watching you, you know that right?

827
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,539
LAURA: Just kidding!

828
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,935
TALIESIN: It's like you got fuzzy for a second.

829
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:03,815
LIAM: I've been listening in and I come in and say:
What about this? And I use Presence Awe on him.

830
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,128
TALIESIN: Are you going to try Presence Awe?

831
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:06,278
LIAM: Sure am.

832
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,503
TALIESIN: I'm going to double check my--

833
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:09,478
LIAM: What do I roll? Charisma plus persuasion is
all it says.

834
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,618
TALIESIN: So give me a roll of 1d10.

835
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,643
LIAM: All right. Well, charisma plus persuasion?

836
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:15,940
TALIESIN: Well first give me a hunger roll since
I'm learning how to--

837
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,274
LIAM: Ooh, I failed it.

838
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:18,807
TALIESIN: You got a one?

839
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:20,581
LIAM: Wow, there are a lot of failures tonight.
Yeah.

840
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:23,911
TALIESIN: All right, you're getting an extra
hunger. But now do your charisma plus persuasion.

841
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:38,023
Where's my lizard?

842
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:43,150
LIAM: Two successes, and one failure on a blood
die. A lot of failures on a fucking blood die.

843
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,717
TALIESIN: My god, oh, what, nope.

844
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:47,093
TRAVIS: You're rolling crap tonight.

845
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:53,406
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're not alone. Yeah, Lock's
looking at you.

846
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:54,921
LIAM: Yeah?

847
00:49:54,921 --> 00:50:00,147
TALIESIN: "You look familiar. I don't know why.
Hmm."

848
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:03,715
LIAM: Do you work in the business?

849
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:06,494
SAM: He's an agent at UTA.

850
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:12,752
TALIESIN: Gets about that much sun. "And-- hmm."

851
00:50:12,752 --> 00:50:17,228
LIAM: Bottom line, we don't mean you any harm, I
mean, we're hungry, but you're not really our--

852
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:19,187
TALIESIN: "I wouldn't recommend it."

853
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:20,790
LIAM: You're not our diet.

854
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:21,970
LAURA: Yeah.

855
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,111
SAM: If I untie you, do you promise not to run
away?

856
00:50:25,111 --> 00:50:26,569
LAURA: Can you help us?

857
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:31,380
TRAVIS: We'd be most grateful.

858
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,085
LIAM: Just the basics.

859
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:38,026
TALIESIN: "I can bring you to someone you can talk
to."

860
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:41,461
LAURA: Are they going to kill us?

861
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:42,898
TRAVIS: Like you?

862
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:47,215
LAURA: "I don't know. Yes, like me. We'll see."

863
00:50:47,215 --> 00:50:52,319
LIAM: If you take the vampire teeth out.

864
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,768
TALIESIN: I blame you two, you've put it in my
head!

865
00:50:55,768 --> 00:50:57,527
TRAVIS: I think it's the best we can do.

866
00:50:57,527 --> 00:50:59,179
LAURA: Yeah. Let's do it.

867
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:05,202
SAM: I will untie the beast. Is he more
crocodile?

868
00:51:05,202 --> 00:51:16,273
TALIESIN: He's got a flattened face and very big
gold eyes and sharp shark teeth in the mouth. It's

869
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,905
a very big chop. But he's thin and smaller.

870
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:23,178
LAURA: Before we release you, pinky swear that
you're going to help us.

871
00:51:23,178 --> 00:51:26,493
TALIESIN: Don't know if he has pinkies. Well,
yeah, he could put something out, put a claw.

872
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:29,736
LAURA: Can I try to manipulate him or persuade him
or something?

873
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:34,369
TALIESIN: You can. Do you want to do charisma or
manipulation?

874
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:36,541
LIAM: Taliesin, did my glamor work?

875
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,589
TALIESIN: You don't know.

876
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:40,095
LIAM: Don't know. All right.

877
00:51:40,095 --> 00:51:42,534
LAURA: I'm not as good at it as Vex is.

878
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,693
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you charisma
persuasion.

879
00:51:44,693 --> 00:51:46,493
TRAVIS: Watch where you point that thing.

880
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:48,736
TALIESIN: Stamina.

881
00:51:48,736 --> 00:51:51,334
LAURA: Stamina!

882
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:57,891
TALIESIN: Hashtag Stanima. They made us character
sheets with "stanima" on them.

883
00:51:57,891 --> 00:51:59,972
LAURA: Three successes.

884
00:51:59,972 --> 00:52:05,820
TALIESIN: "I know this is weird, but I swear we've
met."

885
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,453
LAURA: You seem really familiar.

886
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:08,712
TALIESIN: "You look very familiar."

887
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:12,584
LAURA: Yeah! Do you ever go to Jinky's?

888
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:15,551
TALIESIN: "No."

889
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:22,386
LIAM: You're not Nerdist. I mostly know Geek &
Sundry.

890
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:27,410
TALIESIN: Might have been Smart Girls, to be fair
to you. You'd never know if there were lizard people

891
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,556
working.

892
00:52:28,556 --> 00:52:31,309
LAURA: I feel like we know him; let's release him
for sure.

893
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:37,810
LIAM: Before we do: we're idiots, right? We're
brand new. Obviously, there's been some sort of

894
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:42,219
peace between above and below, and we just want to
facilitate that, right?

895
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:46,745
TALIESIN: "That seems fair, yes."

896
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:51,368
SAM: He's been released. I release him.

897
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:58,228
TALIESIN: "Come. I'll take you to the chamber."

898
00:52:58,228 --> 00:53:00,788
TRAVIS: Who will we be meeting?

899
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:09,788
TALIESIN: "Well, that depends. We'll see." You're
going to follow him further down?

900
00:53:09,788 --> 00:53:15,810
TRAVIS: Sure. As we're walking from behind, can I
use my Aura Perception to see what his true

901
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,168
motives are as he's leading us to this chamber?

902
00:53:18,168 --> 00:53:26,699
TALIESIN: Sure. Roll a blood die. Just one die.

903
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:29,257
TRAVIS: Fuck!

904
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,032
TALIESIN: You rolled a one, didn't you?

905
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:32,386
TRAVIS: Yeah, a red one.

906
00:53:32,386 --> 00:53:34,212
TALIESIN: You get another hunger. What are you at
now?

907
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:38,934
TRAVIS: I was at three, down from the four from my
wife rat! Now I'm back up to four.

908
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:44,758
TALIESIN: Is that a proper die? Did I give you one
with an x? It doesn't matter. You know if you rolled

909
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:54,123
a one. Now you can roll your check for that. That
was to see if you get hungrier from using it.

910
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:59,559
SAM: In real life, or as a vampire?

911
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:02,137
LAURA: I know! Can we cut that cake?

912
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:08,189
TRAVIS: That's one blood one and three successes.

913
00:54:08,189 --> 00:54:16,359
TALIESIN: One blood failure? It's going to take
you a little while to figure it out, but he seems

914
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:21,527
frustrated. You get a frustrated vibe from his
aura.

915
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:23,628
TRAVIS: But not the "I'm leading them into a
trap?"

916
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:30,572
TALIESIN: There's nothing duplicitous yet. If
anything, you're getting a little activity up here

917
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:37,517
like he's wracking his brain trying to figure out
what is going on. He seems just as confounded by

918
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:47,018
this, perhaps. You go down a little further
through this cave until you come into a huge

919
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:52,072
clearing that is-- that was amazing!

920
00:54:52,072 --> 00:54:53,975
TRAVIS: I whip my hair back and forth!

921
00:54:53,975 --> 00:54:57,087
LIAM: It's hot in here, so if you could keep doing
that.

922
00:54:57,087 --> 00:55:01,609
TALIESIN: At home, if you want to simulate the
studio right, pump that heat up to about 100

923
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:11,980
degrees. It's great. There's a big interior cavern
that you seem to be under. You're probably pretty

924
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:18,084
deep now. We're probably deeper than the subway
tunnels. Probably, just barely on the other side

925
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:26,735
or a little further past Mulholland, maybe a
little deeper. And you come into these two giant

926
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:34,380
stone lions that have started to decay and crumble
and there's a big, beautiful stone sign that is

927
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:41,331
decaying, falling apart and covered with this
strange luminescent moss and it says Luna Park.

928
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:44,786
TRAVIS: Probably not the restaurant.

929
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:46,575
LAURA: Oh yeah! I was thinking of the restaurant.

930
00:55:46,575 --> 00:55:49,803
TALIESIN: You <i>were</i> thinking of the restaurant.
How do you know the restaurant? I'm so impressed

931
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:50,580
by you.

932
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,478
LAURA: We love that place. It's so good.

933
00:55:52,478 --> 00:56:00,719
TALIESIN: As you come in, you pass through these
arches and there's this strange what can only be

934
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:10,527
described as a supervillain's lair. This is an
abandoned theme park. Underground.

935
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:12,772
LAURA: What?! That's creepy!

936
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:20,804
TALIESIN: There's a lake in front of you with a
beautiful boardwalk that has crumbled into

937
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:28,386
disrepair. There's a strange pyramid volcano in
the distance. There's a strange little

938
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:34,258
amphitheatre to the left that looks like an
ancient Roman colosseum, odd gardens with strange

939
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:41,069
luminous plants growing. If you peek in the back,
you can see the beginning of cages, perhaps for

940
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:42,495
animals.

941
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,627
LIAM: How big are we talking? Like an NFL
stadium?

942
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:48,751
TALIESIN: Slightly less than. About half a
stadium.

943
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,769
SAM: Do you know what the size and shape is,
Liam?

944
00:56:50,769 --> 00:56:52,090
LIAM: I was just in one.

945
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,931
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what, not that we don't
have, but if you want to see it. You can get a

946
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,599
notion of it.

947
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,968
LAURA: Damn, this is big!

948
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:01,323
TALIESIN: It's big.

949
00:57:01,323 --> 00:57:02,966
LAURA: Which direction did we enter from?

950
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:04,035
TALIESIN: From the bottom.

951
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:05,948
LAURA; The main entrance. Wow.

952
00:57:05,948 --> 00:57:11,747
TALIESIN: I will, at some point, post that on the
internet so that people can see.

953
00:57:11,747 --> 00:57:18,859
LAURA: Jeez Louise. That's big and intricate. What
is his name?

954
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:19,802
TALIESIN: Lock.

955
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,657
LAURA: Lock. What is Lock doing right now?

956
00:57:21,657 --> 00:57:28,514
TALIESIN: He is guiding you past the lake to a
strange--

957
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:30,106
SAM: Is this the old zoo?

958
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,225
TALIESIN: No.

959
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:32,623
LAURA: This is still underground?

960
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:38,258
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. I'll tell you about this at the
break and then I'll tell you where that map came

961
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:43,169
from. It's fascinating. This is my other hobby
that I'm bringing into this game.

962
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:46,839
SAM: Collecting old lizard maps of LA?

963
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:55,151
TRAVIS: See, Taliesin's so immortal, he remembers
the civilizations that preceded--

964
00:57:55,151 --> 00:58:01,443
TALIESIN: 5000 years ago. 5000 years is how long
lizard people have been in Los Angeles. Man. No, I

965
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:08,641
got shit. As he brings you past the lake and he
brings you past the amphitheatre and the strange

966
00:58:08,641 --> 00:58:16,142
gardens with these strange luminous lilies and
these orchids that are growing that never seen

967
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:28,351
sunlight, you come to this weird old Victorian
house that's obviously a facade into a basic black

968
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:32,063
box, like in an amusement park. And above it, it
says "The House of Trouble."

969
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,504
SAM: Treble?

970
00:58:33,504 --> 00:58:35,071
TALIESIN: The House of Trouble.

971
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,508
SAM: There's music in there.

972
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:41,630
TALIESIN: And he is turning up-- not of treble.
It's not the House of Treble. The House of

973
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,714
Trouble, not treble.

974
00:58:42,714 --> 00:58:45,189
SAM: I'm pretty sure you said "treble" twice.

975
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:52,345
TALIESIN: Well, then you're going to be very
disappointed when you go in. And he gestures for

976
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:53,937
you to enter.

977
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:58,408
LAURA: Are you going to come in with 
us? Is it scary?

978
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:00,385
SAM: No, there's music! It's fine.

979
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:02,472
LIAM: Are you not allowed in there, Lock?

980
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:07,984
TALIESIN: "Inside will be those who know
what to do with the four of you."

981
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:11,904
SAM: Without a proper introduction, how will we
know who we're talking to? We really need you in

982
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:13,271
there with us.

983
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,603
TALIESIN: "I'll follow."

984
00:59:14,603 --> 00:59:16,136
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

985
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,390
SAM: Who should go in first?

986
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,404
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

987
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:20,357
SAM: Why?

988
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:21,750
LAURA: Because he's big and strong!

989
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:26,712
SAM: We choose leaders based on size? It should
be on intelligence.

990
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,689
LAURA: So Travis goes first, then?

991
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:32,174
SAM: Yes. Absolutely. But not because he's
strong.

992
00:59:32,174 --> 00:59:36,015
TRAVIS: What's your intelligence rating? Three and
mine's four. So yeah, I'll do that.

993
00:59:36,015 --> 00:59:38,069
LAURA: But you know what? Mine is four as well.

994
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:39,354
LIAM: Same.

995
00:59:39,354 --> 00:59:42,527
SAM: I'm the dumbest one?! Thanks, Taliesin.

996
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:44,516
LIAM: Taliesin's brother.

997
00:59:44,516 --> 00:59:48,268
TALIESIN: My brother! Thank you, Alex Jaffe for
making a judgment call there.

998
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:51,364
SAM: Out of those guys, I think Sam's probably the
dummy.

999
00:59:51,364 --> 00:59:56,579
TALIESIN: You know, maybe if you had gone to
Burning Man, he would have a better opinion of you.

1000
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:58,896
TRAVIS: Is this Tibet's doing?

1001
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,215
TALIESIN: No, it's Alex.

1002
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:02,268
TRAVIS: Oh, it's okay. Okay, great.

1003
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,361
TALIESIN: Both of my brothers are now dipping
their head in panic.

1004
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:07,342
TRAVIS: Laura and I will co-lead this venture into
the chamber.

1005
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,862
LAURA: Liam, you stay back. You have to be safe.

1006
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:11,847
LIAM: Are you sure? Okay. If you insist.

1007
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:13,499
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's actually a good
idea.

1008
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:14,700
LIAM: Only if you insist.

1009
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,973
TRAVIS: Yeah, in fact, just stay behind Sam.

1010
01:00:16,973 --> 01:00:19,788
LIAM: My normal place.

1011
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:22,308
TALIESIN: That's a smart place to be.

1012
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:24,090
SAM: Duh, that sounds good.

1013
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:28,425
TALIESIN: You're not taking that three very well,
are you?

1014
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,770
SAM: Going to the big house.

1015
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:43,595
TALIESIN: Really not taking that three well. Good
to remember. So sorry. As I check my notes, thank

1016
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:57,902
you. As you enter what appears to have once been
perhaps some strange boat ride, some weird tunnel

1017
01:00:57,902 --> 01:01:04,243
of love ride where you have boats that go through
some strange cave, has been drained. And you step

1018
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:08,891
into the cavern and you walk into the back. And as
you curl around into the main amphitheater of the

1019
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:23,365
ride, it is blindingly plated with gold. There is
ancient, beautiful, almost a little bit of Mayan,

1020
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:33,449
a little bit of North American Hopi Indian design
decked through this room. It is gleaming with a

1021
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:42,481
gold glow from all of the plates that have been
intricately set into this room from the throne

1022
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:49,671
that has been set up in the center to the benches
that have been placed around like a bit of an

1023
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:55,867
observation court, like a surgical observation.
You're sitting in a pit in a theater, thank you.

1024
01:01:55,867 --> 01:02:00,013
LAURA: Does it look like it was all done at the
same time, or has it been added over time?

1025
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:06,754
TALIESIN: It's all too old to tell. It's like
walking into a temple. It's hard to tell what came

1026
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:08,075
first and what didn't.

1027
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,552
LIAM: How big is the house? How many seats?

1028
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:12,792
TALIESIN: About 50.

1029
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:14,992
LAURA: So it's like a surgical theater.

1030
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:17,967
TALIESIN: It's like a surgical theater, you're
going to be at the bottom, and then there are rows

1031
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:22,557
of people at the top. And there's not a ton of
people, if you can call them people, there.

1032
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:29,634
There's about 20 lizard men gathered around,
taking a look.

1033
01:02:29,634 --> 01:02:31,515
LIAM: Specifically lizard <i>men</i>?

1034
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:37,775
TALIESIN: You probably can't tell gender yet. And
I wouldn't even necessarily know how one would

1035
01:02:37,775 --> 01:02:40,171
tell gender off the top of my head.

1036
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:41,693
SAM: I've got some ideas.

1037
01:02:41,693 --> 01:02:52,548
TALIESIN: I knew you would. There is obviously a
leader. Lock is coming in from the back and is

1038
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:57,771
joined by two or three others who are not
pressuring you inside but definitely making

1039
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:06,108
sure you're not about to run. As you enter and
stand in the center of the theater, Lock turns to

1040
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:19,916
the lizard creature in the largest, most ornate
gold chair, and turns and says, "My lord Kotori,

1041
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:26,606
"we found them in the tunnels, but I don't think
they are necessarily the ones that have been

1042
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:45,696
"causing our problems." And Kotori takes a moment,
looking over all four of you. "Well. Explain

1043
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:53,585
"yourselves, then. What are you doing in our
tunnels, when we have a very fair agreement with

1044
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:58,493
"the vampires above that you mind your own
business?"

1045
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:07,443
LIAM: I step forward and begin to talk using
Presence Awe again. Which is charisma.

1046
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,638
TALIESIN: Roll your blood and then roll your
charisma.

1047
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:13,317
LIAM: So I roll a single blood die? That's a two.

1048
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,588
TALIESIN: You get one more hunger. Where are you
at?

1049
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:19,571
LIAM: I'm at four. I'm real hungry, lizard.

1050
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:36,688
TALIESIN: What am I going to do with that? Hold
on. All right, you're fine.

1051
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:43,038
LAURA: Oh, that's good. You got a critical
success.

1052
01:04:43,038 --> 01:04:44,628
TALIESIN: One critical success?

1053
01:04:44,628 --> 01:04:45,714
LIAM: Two.

1054
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:47,333
LAURA: He got two tens on blood dice.

1055
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:55,982
TALIESIN: Two tens? Oh my god. On blood dice? That
changes things, okay. That's good to know.

1056
01:04:55,982 --> 01:05:09,212
LIAM: We mean no disrespect or harm, and are in
awe of what you have built here. We have wandered

1057
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:21,523
down by accident due to calamity and we are
children of the night in the purest sense. And we

1058
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:30,208
ask for patience and empathy for the unwise.

1059
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:35,291
SAM: Theater training.

1060
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:47,755
TALIESIN: So it worked. Definitely seems like
he's looking at you with nodding respect. Another

1061
01:05:47,755 --> 01:05:58,766
gaunter lizard comes up to Kotori on the side. "Be
careful of this one. I think he's trying to

1062
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:06,365
"manipulate you." And Kotori sits and looks at you.

1063
01:06:06,365 --> 01:06:22,962
LIAM: I'll go further. We are in fear and awe of
this council. No fucking joke. And all we want is

1064
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:32,384
safe passage and understanding. We don't mean to
subvert or cause problems. Merely to survive.

1065
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:41,983
TALIESIN: "There are rules and protocols in place
for these things. And ignorance of the law is not

1066
01:06:41,983 --> 01:06:52,307
"absolution from the law. However, you did not
know. And the fact that you did not know goes to show

1067
01:06:52,307 --> 01:07:04,109
"there's something very wrong. You should not exist
and not know this. Somebody has made a mistake."

1068
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:07,041
LAURA: Things are kind of crazy out there.

1069
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:11,200
SAM: So if you could undo it and make us humans
again, I think we'll be on our way.

1070
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,822
LIAM: He doesn't speak for all of us.

1071
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:15,017
TALIESIN: "I can make you lizards."

1072
01:07:15,017 --> 01:07:20,362
SAM: That sounds amazing.

1073
01:07:20,362 --> 01:07:22,517
LIAM and TRAVIS: Super cool.

1074
01:07:22,517 --> 01:07:25,866
SAM: It would be really great, but we're still
getting used to this, though.

1075
01:07:25,866 --> 01:07:29,241
LIAM: Might be too soon for a jump right away.

1076
01:07:29,241 --> 01:07:32,842
TALIESIN: (laughing) "No, I can't do that."

1077
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:35,152
LAURA: Aww, you got us.

1078
01:07:35,152 --> 01:07:39,124
TALIESIN: "But you're funny. You're not as smart
as the other ones, are you?"

1079
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:50,036
SAM: Apparently not. I mean, we haven't compared
SAT scores or anything, but we will later tonight.

1080
01:07:50,036 --> 01:07:55,701
LIAM: Sam, this is like Being John Malkovich.
You're not the real John Malkovich. This is like a

1081
01:07:55,701 --> 01:08:00,780
pretend John Malkovich. John Malkovich playing a
pretend John Malkovich. We'll pretend you aren't

1082
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,940
super keen.

1083
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:02,903
SAM: Sure.

1084
01:08:02,903 --> 01:08:05,216
LIAM: Yeah. You look like a serial killer.

1085
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:08,847
TALIESIN: So disturbing. It's really hard to work
through.

1086
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:12,598
TRAVIS: My 1600 will hold up.

1087
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:15,309
SAM: 1600?

1088
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:21,834
TALIESIN: "Well, obviously the four of you are not
our problem. But the fact that you're down here is

1089
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:29,460
"our problem. There have been vampires in our
tunnels for three weeks."

1090
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,963
LAURA: Three weeks?

1091
01:08:30,963 --> 01:08:38,374
TALIESIN: "There are rules, there are protocols,
and obviously they have been ignored. Do you have

1092
01:08:38,374 --> 01:08:45,882
"any notion of what has been going on? Do you
perhaps have any kernel of thought as to the

1093
01:08:45,882 --> 01:08:49,350
"nature of this? Why have people been in our
tunnels?"

1094
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:56,101
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to fluff us up. We don't
know much but we did come in contact with some

1095
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:59,460
sort of vampire lord.

1096
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,913
TALIESIN: "Interesting."

1097
01:09:00,913 --> 01:09:07,611
LAURA: There was a giant meatball that seemed to
be turning people into other things.

1098
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:18,527
SAM: Yeah, that's true. There was also, I mean,
some sort of void under the game table, right? That

1099
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:20,452
could have plunged people down below?

1100
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:24,807
LAURA: Oh yeah. There was a guy that we know that
when we woke up all of a sudden he was a wizard

1101
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:27,039
and he had electricity coming off of him.

1102
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,904
TRAVIS: And are you familiar with one Gary
Gygax?

1103
01:09:30,904 --> 01:09:41,863
TALIESIN: As he's about to speak, from the back,
one of the other lizards goes, "I've heard of Gary Gygax."

1104
01:09:41,863 --> 01:09:55,271
TRAVIS: Yes. Many of us have. We were surprised to
see him up and walking about a mere hour after we

1105
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:57,890
woke and found ourselves in this state.

1106
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:06,092
TALIESIN: This other lizard comes up and starts
whispering in Kotori's ear. Seems very excited

1107
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:07,804
about something.

1108
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,692
LAURA: Do you play D&D?

1109
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:11,069
SAM: He might be a Critter.

1110
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:19,301
TALIESIN: "We have internet down here, we're not
savages. Apparently members of our council are

1111
01:10:19,301 --> 01:10:20,966
"aware of your show."

1112
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:30,561
SAM: They're everywhere! Critters are everywhere!

1113
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:32,767
TALIESIN: You are everywhere. You are literally
everywhere.

1114
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:35,677
TRAVIS: Did we grab any posters or fan art on our
way out?

1115
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:37,269
LIAM: They all burned up.

1116
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:39,459
TALIESIN: Things would have gone so much better if
you had.

1117
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:42,987
LAURA: Hey, I have some merch we were going
to sell in my pocket.

1118
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:49,196
LIAM: The airport, subways, lizard colonies.
There's always one guy.

1119
01:10:49,196 --> 01:10:56,314
LAURA: Do you want coasters? I've got some
Strongjaw coasters.

1120
01:10:56,314 --> 01:11:02,090
TALIESIN: Kotori is giving you an eye, but the
other guy is not making eye contact, he's breaking

1121
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,768
and making eye contact.

1122
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:06,425
LIAM: Is he as old as the rest?

1123
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:14,065
TALIESIN: It's hard to tell, man. What's the
difference? Can you tell the difference between an

1124
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:15,798
old iguana and a young iguana?

1125
01:11:15,798 --> 01:11:20,033
LAURA: Sort of, like the scales are less vibrant.

1126
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:21,806
TALIESIN: They look pretty healthy.

1127
01:11:21,806 --> 01:11:24,637
LIAM: I mean, how much is the iguana talking about
IRAs and shit?

1128
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:31,853
LAURA: Here's the thing. We just want to know
what's going on with us. We just want to know

1129
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:37,433
what's going on. We don't know anything. Is there
something we can do to help you that will, you

1130
01:11:37,433 --> 01:11:42,134
know, we help you, you help us, help us figure out
what's happening.

1131
01:11:42,134 --> 01:11:44,023
TRAVIS: Is there any way to be of service? We
don't mean to offend.

1132
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:45,292
SAM: We're good at catching rats.

1133
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:46,942
LAURA: Yeah, I'm really good at rat catching.

1134
01:11:46,942 --> 01:11:50,051
TRAVIS: He's really fast. I can sense things.

1135
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:51,407
LAURA: I'm sneaky.

1136
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:56,518
LIAM: And also, do you have any human prisoners
down here or anything?

1137
01:11:56,518 --> 01:11:59,901
TALIESIN: "Sadly, we do not."

1138
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:03,891
LAURA: Any other animals that you don't care
about?

1139
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:15,979
TALIESIN: "Sadly, no. The few animals we do have
here have purposes. In the menagerie. But perhaps

1140
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:18,242
"we can come to an arrangement."

1141
01:12:18,242 --> 01:12:20,257
TRAVIS: We're very interested in that.

1142
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:28,534
TALIESIN: "Something has gone wrong. We are going
to have to re-establish some rules, and you're

1143
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:30,718
"obviously someone else's problem."

1144
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:32,178
TRAVIS: Clearly.

1145
01:12:32,178 --> 01:12:39,726
TALIESIN: "We will give you passage to the
surface. We will show you where you can come in

1146
01:12:39,726 --> 01:12:44,750
"contact with some individuals who can clear things
up."

1147
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,474
SAM: Passage to the surface?

1148
01:12:46,474 --> 01:12:47,508
LAURA: That's good.

1149
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:53,230
TALIESIN: "We will send you to the people whose
problem you are, as opposed to ours. And in return

1150
01:12:53,230 --> 01:13:01,222
"you will deliver a message. You will tell them
that we are displeased and that we have to have

1151
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:10,593
"words and that they must find a way of becoming
friends with us again. We will need--"

1152
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:13,122
LAURA: A boon!

1153
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:24,397
TALIESIN: "A boon. They will owe us for their
transgression. And you will deliver our message."

1154
01:13:24,397 --> 01:13:26,193
LAURA: We can do that.

1155
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:31,351
SAM: Sure. It doesn't seem like a great message to
deliver to someone. Just saying, like, they might

1156
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:32,433
be upset with us.

1157
01:13:32,433 --> 01:13:37,671
TALIESIN: "Oh, they may kill you. Vampires are not
known for their kindness."

1158
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:39,371
TRAVIS: Well, we might change that.

1159
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:42,097
LAURA: I mean, we're really nice. Pretty
genuine--

1160
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:47,619
LIAM: I'm a good talker these days. These
hours. If I could maybe eat?

1161
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:52,001
TRAVIS: We're very interested in getting to the
surface. We will deliver your message as you've

1162
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:53,213
described it.

1163
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:54,505
LIAM: Gratefully.

1164
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:59,778
SAM: But I feel like if it's nighttime we should
probably hurry. Because we can't be up there when

1165
01:13:59,778 --> 01:14:01,238
the sun comes up.

1166
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:02,609
LAURA: No, it'll kill us. I saw what happened to
Matt.

1167
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:03,561
LIAM: No, yeah.

1168
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:12,244
TALIESIN: "You won't have to be up there for very
long. Lock! Mahlo! Take them to the pyramid. Show

1169
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:14,174
"them to Los Globos."

1170
01:14:14,174 --> 01:14:19,555
LAURA: How long have you been a lizard person,
Lock? Have you always been a lizard person?

1171
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,609
TALIESIN: "Yes, of course."

1172
01:14:22,609 --> 01:14:25,838
LAURA: Are you thousands of years old?

1173
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:35,822
TALIESIN: "No, we've been here for thousands of
years. I am merely 250, 300 at this point."

1174
01:14:35,822 --> 01:14:38,348
TRAVIS: Infancy. Got it.

1175
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:43,782
LAURA: Cool. Just wondering.

1176
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:46,556
TALIESIN: "You'll know what that feels like if
you're lucky."

1177
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:50,000
LIAM: (whispering) That's what I'm talking about,
Travis!

1178
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,554
LAURA: I mean, we might not change back you guys.

1179
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:54,933
SAM: But what about our friends, our family?

1180
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:57,555
TRAVIS: Yeah, and fashion trends? They're such a
bitch to keep up with.

1181
01:14:57,555 --> 01:15:04,987
SAM: You're just going to give up everyone you
know and love to be immortal sewer vampires?

1182
01:15:04,987 --> 01:15:14,078
LIAM: Yeah, Sam! Yeah! This feels great! I mean,
I'm hungry, but we get to spend time together for

1183
01:15:14,078 --> 01:15:15,987
fucking ever!

1184
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:19,006
SAM: I love hanging out with you, but it's not
like we can podcast from down here.

1185
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:21,835
LIAM: They've got internet.

1186
01:15:21,835 --> 01:15:27,492
TALIESIN: "We have actually really good broadband
down here. It's insane."

1187
01:15:27,492 --> 01:15:31,287
LIAM: Question. Have you heard AllWorkNoPlay? Any
episodes?

1188
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:33,013
TALIESIN: "Of course, yeah. I've listened to the
whole thing."

1189
01:15:33,013 --> 01:15:35,070
LIAM: You've got nothing. You've got nothing!

1190
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,104
TRAVIS: Their router obviously runs through
Malaysia.

1191
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:39,896
SAM: I'll think about it.

1192
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:42,868
LAURA: Let's go.

1193
01:15:42,868 --> 01:15:43,884
TRAVIS: We're ready to go.

1194
01:15:43,884 --> 01:15:51,211
TALIESIN: "Good luck. And, Lock, see if you can't
wrangle them up something to eat on the way up

1195
01:15:51,211 --> 01:16:02,076
"there." Lock nods and starts leading you all,
along with Mahlo, who's definitely not quite

1196
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:08,574
grinning. I'm not entirely sure what you would
call this weird curl at the side as they lead you

1197
01:16:08,574 --> 01:16:10,264
to the pyramid at the very back.

1198
01:16:10,264 --> 01:16:12,726
LIAM: Is it one of these smiles?

1199
01:16:12,726 --> 01:16:14,846
LAURA: It's one of those.

1200
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:16,152
TALIESIN: It's like an iguana smile.

1201
01:16:16,152 --> 01:16:18,509
LAURA: Oh, cute. Marlo?

1202
01:16:18,509 --> 01:16:29,461
TALIESIN: Mahlo, Lock, Kotori are the three we've
met so far. Mahlo and Lock are taking you to the

1203
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:30,700
pyramid.

1204
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,098
LIAM: Which leads to Los Globos?

1205
01:16:33,098 --> 01:16:34,350
TALIESIN: You'll find out.

1206
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:39,833
SAM: Does anyone speak Spanish? What does Los
Globos mean?

1207
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,996
TALIESIN: I'm so amused by all of this.

1208
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:46,093
SAM: The Globos. What does that mean?

1209
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:50,856
TALIESIN: As you walk back across the lake, past
the not-quite-abandoned zoo, but slightly

1210
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:54,392
abandoned, there are definitely some creatures in
there that look vaguely familiar.

1211
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:56,172
LIAM: They're not typical, though?

1212
01:16:56,172 --> 01:17:00,595
TALIESIN: There's something a little off about all
of them. It's as if somebody had grabbed a mountain

1213
01:17:00,595 --> 01:17:05,576
lion and bred them for a few centuries and saw
what happened without sunlight. So they've all

1214
01:17:05,576 --> 01:17:11,549
started to lose their eyes and they've all got the
little bit of milky, appendage eye. Everything's

1215
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:13,037
gotten a little weird down here.

1216
01:17:13,037 --> 01:17:16,612
LAURA: Creepy. Ooh, very much like The Descent.

1217
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:21,210
TALIESIN: And there's a lot, again, that white
luminescent algae everywhere. That spiky,

1218
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,871
crystalline white luminescent algae is
everywhere.

1219
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:24,993
LIAM: Gross.

1220
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:28,034
LAURA: Cool. I'm excited to get up top.

1221
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:35,948
TALIESIN: So as you climb the steps of the
pyramid, and I'm going to also point out, this is

1222
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:40,929
obviously a man-made pyramid and maybe only about
80 years old, and like, Disneyland-bullshit

1223
01:17:40,929 --> 01:17:47,094
pyramid, definitely a little iffy and has seen
better days.

1224
01:17:47,094 --> 01:17:54,564
LIAM: Guys, so, careful. I do not want to get
Mercer-ed. Or you guys, but especially me. Let's go.

1225
01:17:54,564 --> 01:17:57,123
TALIESIN: You don't want to get Mercer-ed? Or
Marisha-ed?

1226
01:17:57,123 --> 01:18:00,475
LAURA: Or that. I feel like Marisha-ed is worse.

1227
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,631
TALIESIN: Marisha-ed is worse, in my opinion. If
you're going to go, go quick.

1228
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:05,530
LIAM: Worse, but Mercer-ed seems easier to happen.

1229
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:12,782
TALIESIN: That requires a Power Ranger helmet,
too. You make your way up the slightly cartoonish

1230
01:18:12,782 --> 01:18:22,354
pyramid. At the very top, there's another one of
those weird little square cube exits that you saw

1231
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:23,507
in the sewer.

1232
01:18:23,507 --> 01:18:25,260
LIAM: So the pyramid goes all the way to the top?

1233
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:32,316
TALIESIN: All the way to the top, and then there's
a drop ladder that goes right into a little brick

1234
01:18:32,316 --> 01:18:37,138
cavern. It's only big enough for one person at a
time, and you have to crawl up on those awful fire

1235
01:18:37,138 --> 01:18:44,224
escape ladders from the 40s, and there's more of
that awful white crystalline algae.

1236
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:50,120
TRAVIS: I'll go first this time. I'm very
perceptive. I can hear and smell and see things.

1237
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,695
LAURA: It's really high though, baby.

1238
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:58,702
TRAVIS: I'm a fucking vampire. I'll fly up there.
I go and I try to fly.

1239
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:05,159
TALIESIN: Cool, actually-- I'm so fucking with
you.

1240
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:10,875
TRAVIS: Aw, damn it! I thought I was going to Lost
Boys that shit. Fuck!

1241
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:21,375
TALIESIN: You cool. You ain't that cool. Are you
actually going to try and--? Give me a dexterity

1242
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:23,858
athletics.

1243
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:36,972
TRAVIS: Okay. Wait, (mumbling). All successes, no
failures, and one ten.

1244
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,144
TALIESIN: How many successes?

1245
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:39,926
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four, five.

1246
01:19:39,926 --> 01:19:46,347
TALIESIN: You don't fly, but you manage, after you
make a good leap, and by the time you realize that

1247
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:52,092
gravity is reasserting itself upon your person,
you are smart enough to extend your hands and legs

1248
01:19:52,092 --> 01:19:53,690
out and--

1249
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,675
LIAM: Flying squirrel.

1250
01:19:56,675 --> 01:20:02,382
TALIESIN: You made a good hop. It was impressive.
It was very impressive.

1251
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:03,766
LAURA: Baby, did you fly?

1252
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,894
TRAVIS: I didn't want to show off too long.

1253
01:20:05,894 --> 01:20:07,373
LAURA: Holy--!

1254
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:09,424
SAM: I'm going to try to turn into a bat.

1255
01:20:09,424 --> 01:20:15,109
LIAM: See, vampires are fucking awesome. Your
husband can fly. My husband can run.

1256
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:20,659
TALIESIN: How are we going to do this? Give me a
willpower check. Just straight willpower.

1257
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:24,846
LIAM: What are you doing? You're trying to turn
into a bat? Oh my god. Do it.

1258
01:20:24,846 --> 01:20:27,210
SAM: Three successes.

1259
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,459
TALIESIN: Three successes? You do not give a
little squirt of poop, then. Well done.

1260
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,454
SAM: (straining)

1261
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:37,806
LIAM: You feel it, but it stays up inside.

1262
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:41,184
SAM: We can't be bats.

1263
01:20:41,184 --> 01:20:43,045
TALIESIN: <i>You</i> can't be bats.

1264
01:20:43,045 --> 01:20:46,347
SAM: But maybe we can walk through walls and
shit?

1265
01:20:46,347 --> 01:20:47,727
LAURA: We haven't tried it.

1266
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:55,014
TRAVIS: I make my way up toward the ladder.

1267
01:20:55,014 --> 01:21:05,332
TALIESIN: Eventually, after quite a few feet, that
ladder goes up and up and up. It's about 450, 500

1268
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:08,264
feet before anything stops.

1269
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,673
LIAM: And we're all in the top of this ziggurat?

1270
01:21:10,673 --> 01:21:15,603
TALIESIN: And then it's a 90 degree turn and that
brick cavern goes straight out. It is a very

1271
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:17,428
claustrophobic crawl.

1272
01:21:17,428 --> 01:21:19,305
LIAM: (yelling) Travis!

1273
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,261
TRAVIS: So the ladder goes straight up, and then
it turns?

1274
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:22,561
TALIESIN: Just L's really hard.

1275
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:24,567
TRAVIS: At the surface, or into more under-earth?

1276
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:28,323
TALIESIN: More underground, in that same cube
that's not big enough to stand up in. It's about

1277
01:21:28,323 --> 01:21:30,821
maybe three feet by three feet. It's a little
claustrophobic.

1278
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:31,906
LIAM: Blam!

1279
01:21:31,906 --> 01:21:38,632
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm up here. There's a tunnel that
continues at the top of this stupidly, absurdly

1280
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:44,282
long ladder. It's only single-file. I guess you
guys can make your way up here, and we can crawl

1281
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:49,842
wherever this goes. Will you ask Mahlo if we're
supposed to crawl through this?

1282
01:21:49,842 --> 01:21:54,073
LAURA: Mahlo, are we supposed to crawl through
that tunnel? He's nodding!

1283
01:21:54,073 --> 01:21:58,573
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, go ahead and come up. I'll get
started.

1284
01:21:58,573 --> 01:22:04,591
LIAM: I'll give you a boost, but how are we all
going to--? Okay. This comes naturally.

1285
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:06,930
TRAVIS: Do I hear anything in the tunnel, now that
I'm up there?

1286
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,947
TALIESIN: Do you want to listen, or do you want to
<i>really</i> listen?

1287
01:22:09,947 --> 01:22:13,788
TRAVIS: With four red dice, I'll just listen.

1288
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:15,095
TALIESIN: No.

1289
01:22:15,095 --> 01:22:16,824
TRAVIS: Okay.

1290
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:18,054
LIAM: Do you still have that cable?

1291
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:20,294
SAM: Yeah, of course. It's all coiled up.

1292
01:22:20,294 --> 01:22:23,051
TALIESIN: I love that you're Indiana Jones-ing
this.

1293
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:26,084
LIAM: So one of us boosts the other up, drops the
cable. Don't dick me.

1294
01:22:26,084 --> 01:22:30,378
SAM: Of course not, but I don't know if an XLR
cable will hold us.

1295
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:34,184
LIAM: It's got to. I mean, neither of us are
Willingham.

1296
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:35,633
LAURA: You could try to jump.

1297
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:37,200
LIAM: I could try. It's not going to be pretty.

1298
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:45,618
SAM: Wait, I'll lift you up. My powers, I can walk
up walls and shit, can't I? There's no wall to

1299
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:46,668
walk up?

1300
01:22:46,668 --> 01:22:51,078
LIAM: Thousands of feet away! We're at the top of a
ziggurat looking at the ceiling!

1301
01:22:51,078 --> 01:22:53,974
TRAVIS: Do I see anything, like a switch or a
button, to lower something?

1302
01:22:53,974 --> 01:23:02,712
TALIESIN: No, although, I mean, you're way up
there, now. You've left these plebs behind. Lock

1303
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:04,526
will also look around and do the--

1304
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:06,618
SAM: Oh, he can help!

1305
01:23:06,618 --> 01:23:09,431
LIAM: Yeah, Lock, can you boost my friend?

1306
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:12,093
TALIESIN: "Yes, of course, yes. We can do that."

1307
01:23:12,093 --> 01:23:16,420
SAM: We'll sign, like, a Player's Handbook.

1308
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:22,128
TALIESIN: "I don't care." Mahlo is losing their
shit a little bit.

1309
01:23:22,128 --> 01:23:24,744
LIAM: Don't offer to Mahlo.

1310
01:23:24,744 --> 01:23:29,839
TALIESIN: It hurts, man. I give you a Critter, and
that's how you--?

1311
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:35,367
LAURA: I'm going to drop the dice down to Mahlo as
I'm climbing.

1312
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:36,915
TALIESIN: Mahlo will remember this.

1313
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:38,307
LAURA: I keep climbing.

1314
01:23:38,307 --> 01:23:41,344
SAM: All right, so you boost me up?

1315
01:23:41,344 --> 01:23:53,152
LIAM: Mahlo, come here. Let me find a Sharpie. I
write on his arm, "VAX ///" Let's go.

1316
01:23:53,152 --> 01:23:54,333
TALIESIN: "Cool!"

1317
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,522
LAURA: See, you're so cool.

1318
01:23:56,522 --> 01:24:02,859
LIAM: I'm not, but that's what I did. I'm not at
all. And I step on Sam's back and I jump.

1319
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:10,064
TALIESIN: Give me a dex athletics just for fun.
That's okay. This is not hard.

1320
01:24:10,064 --> 01:24:19,646
LIAM: I'm not talking about the character sheet.
Dex athletics, okay. Ooh, well, one success on a

1321
01:24:19,646 --> 01:24:23,063
blood die, and one fail on a non-blood die.

1322
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:29,863
TALIESIN: Nothing bad happens, but you miss on
your first attempt. You can get one more.

1323
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:34,885
LIAM: Same shit? Yeah. Two successes.

1324
01:24:34,885 --> 01:24:39,882
TALIESIN: That's all you needed. Actually, I
should have done the-- never mind. I can use that

1325
01:24:39,882 --> 01:24:43,514
next time. I keep forgetting I have this mechanic
they gave me that's super cool, and I'm not taking

1326
01:24:43,514 --> 01:24:49,922
advantage of it. Sorry, White Wolf. I'll start
doing that, because it's a cool mechanic. I think

1327
01:24:49,922 --> 01:24:54,128
they're in chat. Yeah, you make it. You're
crawling up. You guys are going?

1328
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:57,306
LIAM: Yeah, boys, can you help my friend up?

1329
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:59,920
TALIESIN: Yeah, they'll give you a little boost
up.

1330
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,049
SAM: Great.

1331
01:25:01,049 --> 01:25:04,194
TALIESIN: You can get, at whatever speed you
like, that you want to get up there, because you

1332
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:05,383
are fast as all hell.

1333
01:25:05,383 --> 01:25:07,137
SAM: I'll hang with Liam. Got to stay close.

1334
01:25:07,137 --> 01:25:09,060
LAURA: I'm already up and behind. I'm second.

1335
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:13,081
TALIESIN: You've got a long tunnel to crawl
to. It is not comfortable. It is a little

1336
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:20,705
claustrophobic. It's a little cramped. I want
everyone to, really quickly, roll a d10 for me.

1337
01:25:20,705 --> 01:25:25,819
LIAM: You're so big in a small space. Seven.

1338
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:28,003
SAM: Non-success. Four.

1339
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,244
TRAVIS: I rolled a one.

1340
01:25:30,244 --> 01:25:36,912
TALIESIN: You rolled a one, though? Let's have a
little fun with you. Where's my little chart?

1341
01:25:36,912 --> 01:25:45,492
Where's my chart of pain? I have too many papers.
Ah, here we go. There's my chart of pain. Let's

1342
01:25:45,492 --> 01:25:47,003
give you--

1343
01:25:47,003 --> 01:25:54,160
SAM: I'm going to be wearing this costume every
day for the next few days. This is my Halloween

1344
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,564
costume.

1345
01:25:55,564 --> 01:25:58,264
LAURA: It's really bad. Maybe get a different
one.

1346
01:25:58,264 --> 01:26:00,992
SAM: Laura, my eyes are up here, okay?

1347
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:07,896
TALIESIN: You've got the hangries. You're a
little irritated. You're having trouble thinking

1348
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:12,414
clearly and you are not subtle about anything.
You're going to have a really hard time being

1349
01:26:12,414 --> 01:26:18,379
clever. It's just that, yeah. It doesn't feel
good. You get what I'm getting at? Travis, do you

1350
01:26:18,379 --> 01:26:20,297
understand? Are you sure you're clear?

1351
01:26:20,297 --> 01:26:22,637
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah. I will fucking fang you
right now.

1352
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:31,703
TALIESIN: Cool. So yeah, this is a bit of a trek.
You come out, as you finally breach through, and

1353
01:26:31,703 --> 01:26:36,384
you seem to be in a crypt in the Hollywood
cemetery.

1354
01:26:36,384 --> 01:26:40,531
LIAM: We're within a mausoleum, or something?

1355
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:41,751
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1356
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:43,780
LAURA: Can I see a door? Is there a door?

1357
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:49,730
TALIESIN: There is a gate. It is unlocked. This is
practically an easy access to the surface.

1358
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,024
LAURA: Is there anything cool in this room? Are
there buttons?

1359
01:26:52,024 --> 01:27:01,833
TALIESIN: There are two caskets stacked on the
side, other than this little broken hole in the

1360
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:03,769
floor that you came through.

1361
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:06,795
LIAM: A metal gate? That we can see through?

1362
01:27:06,795 --> 01:27:08,635
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you can see through it. It's
just a gate.

1363
01:27:08,635 --> 01:27:10,900
SAM: Is it night still?

1364
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,323
TALIESIN: It is still night. Just barely.

1365
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:17,165
SAM: So wait, there's a gate that prevents us from
leaving this crypt?

1366
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,213
TALIESIN: Well, it's not locked or
anything. It's just a gate.

1367
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:23,685
TRAVIS: Does anybody else want to open the fucking
door, for once?

1368
01:27:23,685 --> 01:27:25,805
TALIESIN: I'm not going to make you fight doors.
It is getting a little cramped in here because

1369
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:28,149
it's only big enough for, like, four coffins, and
it's already two coffins full.

1370
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:29,944
LIAM: Is there any writing in here?

1371
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:34,122
TALIESIN: There is a name-- No, there's actually
no writing on the inside. It's all on the

1372
01:27:34,122 --> 01:27:35,057
outside.

1373
01:27:35,057 --> 01:27:36,278
LAURA: I open the gate.

1374
01:27:36,278 --> 01:27:40,121
LIAM: I duck behind one of the coffins.

1375
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,997
TALIESIN: It's filthy. But other than that--

1376
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:44,176
LIAM: Okay, that's fine.

1377
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:51,655
TALIESIN: All right, you step out into the late
night. It feels like time did not move at an

1378
01:27:51,655 --> 01:27:57,884
appropriate speed, like, the night is still darker
than it should be. You don't know how long you

1379
01:27:57,884 --> 01:28:01,834
were down there, but it feels like you were down
there a little longer than this.

1380
01:28:01,834 --> 01:28:06,214
LAURA: Is it possible an entire day passed while
we were down there? Because it's still real super dark.

1381
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,134
TALIESIN: It's entirely possible, but you're not
sure.

1382
01:28:08,134 --> 01:28:12,508
SAM: We were so fast that we got here in like ten
minutes.

1383
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:15,423
TRAVIS: Is there a name on the outside of the
crypt that we walked out of?

1384
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:18,217
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. It just says "Macbeth."

1385
01:28:18,217 --> 01:28:21,677
LIAM: Now that's happy.

1386
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:25,469
TRAVIS: Hollywood cemetery.

1387
01:28:25,469 --> 01:28:26,805
SAM: Are there humans around?

1388
01:28:26,805 --> 01:28:31,001
TALIESIN: There are definitely some humans around,
just walking around.

1389
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:32,717
SAM: Is it movie night?

1390
01:28:32,717 --> 01:28:35,562
TALIESIN: It is not movie night. For those of you
who don't know, we have movie nights at our

1391
01:28:35,562 --> 01:28:37,066
cemetery because that's fun.

1392
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:38,313
LIAM: Is it a goth party?

1393
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,455
TALIESIN: It's not a goth party.

1394
01:28:39,455 --> 01:28:42,176
LAURA: It's just regular humans, nobody seems
scared? They're not running around, it's not scary?

1395
01:28:42,176 --> 01:28:44,450
TRAVIS: Do they look like they're paying their
respects?

1396
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:48,873
TALIESIN: They look like hipsters in Hollywood,
hanging out at the hipster cemetery.

1397
01:28:48,873 --> 01:28:50,940
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Great.

1398
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,442
SAM: Are you guys going to feed?

1399
01:28:52,442 --> 01:28:58,691
TRAVIS: No! I am going to do a little natural
selection. Is there anyone that looks like they

1400
01:28:58,691 --> 01:29:07,267
are weak and clearly ailing and ready to have it
all come to an end?

1401
01:29:07,267 --> 01:29:09,442
LIAM: I'm looking for loners.

1402
01:29:09,442 --> 01:29:12,334
TALIESIN: If you walk around a little bit--

1403
01:29:12,334 --> 01:29:15,487
LAURA: I'm suddenly super uncomfortable with it.

1404
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:18,353
SAM: Is there a group of these guys, of these
humans?

1405
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:23,754
TALIESIN: Are you going to look around and find a
potential victim? I'm going to say right now, from

1406
01:29:23,754 --> 01:29:29,489
your experience, it is possible not to kill people
when you drink from them, by the way.

1407
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:30,708
LIAM: Whatever.

1408
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:32,287
TALIESIN: I know. Good for you.

1409
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:34,455
TRAVIS: I'm definitely looking for somebody. I've
got four red dice.

1410
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:41,224
TALIESIN: What's your hunger level? Okay, so you
definitely have something resembling morality

1411
01:29:41,224 --> 01:29:42,352
functioning right now.

1412
01:29:42,352 --> 01:29:46,347
SAM: Listen, let's not jump the gun on this.
I know you guys are hungry, but let's do this

1413
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:55,676
smart. I'm fast, you're stealthy, right? Okay, how
about this. Me and Laura will go around. I'll

1414
01:29:55,676 --> 01:30:02,185
chase them toward you. Laura can keep them
contained, and we'll drive them to you guys rather

1415
01:30:02,185 --> 01:30:05,311
than us trying to chase them, we'll drive them
this way.

1416
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:08,512
TRAVIS: Question. If we try and herd them, won't
they be doing that human thing called screaming,

1417
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,090
and making a racket?

1418
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:15,045
SAM: But it's a cemetery, and they're hipsters!
They could be joking around with each other.

1419
01:30:15,045 --> 01:30:20,300
LIAM: I'm already gone. I'm looking for somebody
on their own. I'm looking for an antelope away

1420
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,445
from the herd.

1421
01:30:21,445 --> 01:30:26,921
TALIESIN: Okay, and I'll add, you still have two
lizard people who have now put up little hoods so

1422
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:31,086
they're a little more incognito, but it's
Hollywood, so who really would notice two people

1423
01:30:31,086 --> 01:30:36,387
with lizard faces? Legitimately, we wouldn't care.
We don't care. This is how they've been here for

1424
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:43,812
five thousand years. No one cares. Yeah, there's
a, well, there's always the porta-potties.

1425
01:30:43,812 --> 01:30:45,926
LIAM: Sure.

1426
01:30:45,926 --> 01:30:48,687
LAURA: Ugh, stinky meal.

1427
01:30:48,687 --> 01:30:51,233
LIAM: Sure. I'm into it.

1428
01:30:51,233 --> 01:30:55,638
TALIESIN: You're into it? All right. As you curl
around, there's usually that little set that are

1429
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:58,575
out by the street, and there's not too many people
in the cemetery tonight, wandering

1430
01:30:58,575 --> 01:30:59,685
around being silly.

1431
01:30:59,685 --> 01:31:04,524
LIAM: So I look for one of the porta-potties
that's got the little circle turned to red, right?

1432
01:31:04,524 --> 01:31:07,534
Yeah. (knocking)

1433
01:31:07,534 --> 01:31:12,820
TALIESIN: "Just a minute!"

1434
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:14,502
LIAM: I forcibly yank it open.

1435
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,714
TALIESIN: You can give a try. See how this goes.

1436
01:31:17,714 --> 01:31:19,771
SAM: You don't have superhuman strength, right?
You're just Liam.

1437
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:24,987
LIAM: Yeah, you know how shitty porta-potties are
built? I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I

1438
01:31:24,987 --> 01:31:27,996
could break open. The one thing.

1439
01:31:27,996 --> 01:31:30,235
TALIESIN: Strength brawl.

1440
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:38,700
LIAM: Sure. Oh, that's going to be shitty.
Strength. Ooh, what do I--? I have more blood die

1441
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:46,326
than strength and brawl combined. All blood die?
Word. One fail.

1442
01:31:46,326 --> 01:31:47,495
TALIESIN: Only one fail?

1443
01:31:47,495 --> 01:31:48,518
LAURA: But no successes!

1444
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:50,078
SAM: And it's a blood die.

1445
01:31:50,078 --> 01:31:53,818
TRAVIS: "I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I
can break into."

1446
01:31:53,818 --> 01:32:00,575
TALIESIN: You pull, and you're not succeeding.
You're like, thunk, thunk! And all you hear from

1447
01:32:00,575 --> 01:32:03,919
the inside is, "Dude, really? Come on!"

1448
01:32:03,919 --> 01:32:08,111
LIAM: Yeah, sorry, man, it's uncalled-for. I'm
sorry. I'm going to wait until he's done.

1449
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:09,370
TALIESIN: You're going to wait?

1450
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:18,526
LIAM: I'm waiting in line, and as soon as the door
opens, as soon as I hear k-chunk, I'm yanking it

1451
01:32:18,526 --> 01:32:22,983
open and pushing in. I'm biting. Yeah. As soon as
that door's open.

1452
01:32:22,983 --> 01:32:27,040
TALIESIN: You wait for a minute, and there's
definitely sounds coming from in there.

1453
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,509
LAURA: It's going to be so stinky!

1454
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:36,180
TALIESIN: It's a blue porta-potty. This is what
you're getting. Are you going to take a moment to

1455
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,787
look around and see if anybody's looking?

1456
01:32:37,787 --> 01:32:39,330
LIAM: Of course!

1457
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:44,509
TALIESIN: All right, so you hear things finishing
up there, take a look around. Give me a

1458
01:32:44,509 --> 01:32:49,325
perception, where are we, perception awareness.

1459
01:32:49,325 --> 01:32:54,365
LAURA: He's taking a while. Eww.

1460
01:32:54,365 --> 01:33:01,749
LIAM: I'm so hungry. Oh no, I need another blood
die. That's great. Three successes, one failure.

1461
01:33:01,749 --> 01:33:03,463
TALIESIN: Three successes, one failure?

1462
01:33:03,463 --> 01:33:04,643
LIAM: The successes are on blood die.

1463
01:33:04,643 --> 01:33:22,665
TALIESIN: But one failure? Okay, the door unlocks,
starts to swing open, and you're in. You didn't

1464
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:23,981
even look? You're going for it?

1465
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:25,433
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going.

1466
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:32,558
TALIESIN: All right, you're in. So let me remember
how to do this. I'm so amused.

1467
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:34,034
LAURA: I feel like there are more subtle ways to
get blood.

1468
01:33:34,034 --> 01:33:36,089
TALIESIN: There are absolutely more subtle ways,
but that's not how this is happening.

1469
01:33:36,089 --> 01:33:43,512
LIAM: I don't care, I'm so fucking hungry right
now. What happens if I wanted to use Dread Gaze on

1470
01:33:43,512 --> 01:33:44,711
this person?

1471
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:45,644
TALIESIN: You could attempt to.

1472
01:33:45,644 --> 01:33:46,953
LIAM: But I risk more hunger, right?

1473
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:48,234
TALIESIN: Yeah, but at this point?

1474
01:33:48,234 --> 01:33:54,305
LIAM: No, I'm not going to do that yet. What do I
do?

1475
01:33:54,305 --> 01:34:04,033
TALIESIN: Where am I? It's strength brawl plus
two.

1476
01:34:04,033 --> 01:34:15,796
LIAM: Okay. Two successes and one failure.

1477
01:34:15,796 --> 01:34:21,640
TALIESIN: Two successes and one failure? Is that
with the plus two from the vampire fangs?

1478
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:28,120
LIAM: Yes, wait, what did I roll? It's brawl plus
something plus two, you said, right?

1479
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,129
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength, plus brawl, plus two.

1480
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:31,944
LIAM: So I actually rolled too many die.

1481
01:34:31,944 --> 01:34:35,498
TALIESIN: Oh, try again. This is a new
system, I'm being gentle on people.

1482
01:34:35,498 --> 01:34:41,803
LIAM: Two successes, one failure. Same thing.

1483
01:34:41,803 --> 01:34:49,920
TALIESIN: Okay. And the one failure's a one? All right.
It's a bit of a struggle, but you get in there.

1484
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,488
LIAM: Yeah, we're in, already! Nobody can see us
in here! They probably think we're macking.

1485
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:56,503
TALIESIN: How heavy are you draining this person?

1486
01:34:56,503 --> 01:35:01,077
LIAM: Well, I'm new at this, so I don't know. If I
keep going, do I get fed more?

1487
01:35:01,077 --> 01:35:06,372
TALIESIN: You can top off if you like, but if--
yeah. You can attempt to top off, or you can feed

1488
01:35:06,372 --> 01:35:08,211
until you're not ravenous.

1489
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:09,556
LIAM: Let's top off.

1490
01:35:09,556 --> 01:35:10,770
TALIESIN: You're going to top off?

1491
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,568
LIAM: Well, I don't know what that means, but yes.
Let's top off.

1492
01:35:12,568 --> 01:35:13,751
TALIESIN: You're going to drink until you don't
want to drink any more?

1493
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:14,815
LAURA: You're going to kill him.

1494
01:35:14,815 --> 01:35:15,779
LIAM: Yes.

1495
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:21,134
TALIESIN: All right, you are at zero hunger. You
feel perfectly normal, and you have a body in here.

1496
01:35:21,134 --> 01:35:25,015
LIAM: Yes I do. And do I give you any of these
blood die? All of them?

1497
01:35:25,015 --> 01:35:26,679
TALIESIN: All of them. They're all gone.

1498
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:30,251
LIAM: There you are.

1499
01:35:30,251 --> 01:35:33,252
LAURA: It's different when you're surrounded by
crazy things, but now that we're out in the

1500
01:35:33,252 --> 01:35:34,301
normal--

1501
01:35:34,301 --> 01:35:38,883
LIAM: Who is this person, now that I have a
moment?

1502
01:35:38,883 --> 01:35:41,329
TALIESIN: You're staring, and he looks really
familiar.

1503
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:43,160
TRAVIS: Of course!

1504
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,348
TALIESIN: Will Friedle was out--

1505
01:35:46,348 --> 01:35:49,812
TRAVIS: You killed Will Friedle!

1506
01:35:49,812 --> 01:35:53,843
TALIESIN: Will didn't even have the moment of
seeing your face. He never even saw what

1507
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:54,738
happened.

1508
01:35:54,738 --> 01:35:59,178
LIAM: I'm shoving him down through the toilet
seat, in, in, in.

1509
01:35:59,178 --> 01:36:01,456
LAURA: You can't shove a whole body into the--!

1510
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:06,740
TALIESIN: Actually, I assure you that an entire
body can fit in there. Don't ask me how I know.

1511
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,848
LAURA: But what if the poo is stacked really
high?

1512
01:36:08,848 --> 01:36:12,166
TALIESIN: It's not, thankfully. There's no
concert. It's not that bad.

1513
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,652
LIAM: Friedle is into the blue.

1514
01:36:13,652 --> 01:36:16,369
TALIESIN: You have pressed Will beneath the
fluids.

1515
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:18,026
LAURA: Gross.

1516
01:36:18,026 --> 01:36:24,026
LIAM: Will, what are you doing here, really? What
are you doing here? I don't care. I feel so good.

1517
01:36:24,026 --> 01:36:26,421
Being a vampire is the fucking best!

1518
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:28,646
TRAVIS: What do you think Liam's doing?

1519
01:36:28,646 --> 01:36:30,819
SAM: I'm sure he's just looking for someone.

1520
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:36,606
TALIESIN: Yeah, the lizards are trying to usher
you guys out of the cemetery.

1521
01:36:36,606 --> 01:36:38,319
SAM: We're going to hunt.

1522
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:39,824
TALIESIN: You're going to hunt while you're in the
cemetery?

1523
01:36:39,824 --> 01:36:44,924
SAM: I'm going to circle around somebody and try
to drive them to Travis.

1524
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:48,187
TRAVIS: Or, you know, you're also super charming.
You could just--

1525
01:36:48,187 --> 01:36:49,863
TALIESIN: Are you in your Pac-Man suit? No, you're
not. Never mind.

1526
01:36:49,863 --> 01:36:53,599
TRAVIS: You've got a trustworthy face.

1527
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,037
SAM: I've got fangs! Do I have fangs?

1528
01:36:56,037 --> 01:37:00,456
TRAVIS: Maybe ask if somebody will take a picture
of us over by this crypt, you know? Like we're

1529
01:37:00,456 --> 01:37:01,530
visiting.

1530
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:06,625
SAM: Okay. All right, Laura, come with me. Act
like my girlfriend or something. We're going to go

1531
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:09,511
talk to those people and push them toward Travis.

1532
01:37:09,511 --> 01:37:10,564
LAURA: Okay.

1533
01:37:10,564 --> 01:37:12,738
SAM: Are there any people around?

1534
01:37:12,738 --> 01:37:18,728
TALIESIN: There are definitely people around.
They're all over the place. Are you going to go

1535
01:37:18,728 --> 01:37:19,805
wander?

1536
01:37:19,805 --> 01:37:24,719
SAM: Is there anyone who looks stout or like they
have a lot of blood in them?

1537
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:27,758
TALIESIN: They all look pretty juicy, I suppose.

1538
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:32,491
SAM: Is there anyone standing alone-ish or lagging
behind their group?

1539
01:37:32,491 --> 01:37:35,636
TALIESIN: No, there's groups of people, at the
moment, hanging out together.

1540
01:37:35,636 --> 01:37:36,809
LAURA: Anyone we recognize?

1541
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:40,162
TALIESIN: Who wants to look for people they
recognize?

1542
01:37:40,162 --> 01:37:43,944
SAM: Yeah, me too. I'm looking for tourists
specifically.

1543
01:37:43,944 --> 01:37:47,583
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know. I don't feel like
tourists go to Hollywood cemetery, but I'm into

1544
01:37:47,583 --> 01:37:50,252
it. Do a perception awareness.

1545
01:37:50,252 --> 01:38:01,121
LAURA: Four successes.

1546
01:38:01,121 --> 01:38:03,913
SAM: Four successes.

1547
01:38:03,913 --> 01:38:05,879
LIAM: Diplomatic immunity.

1548
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:14,520
TALIESIN: So, yeah, nobody you recognize off the
top of your head, but there's a small, obviously

1549
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:19,157
low-key film shoot happening in the corner.
Somebody's shooting some bullshit YouTube shit.

1550
01:38:19,157 --> 01:38:24,894
And I swear to god, it looks like it's Mike Diva
and Manzi's definitely there. A couple people that

1551
01:38:24,894 --> 01:38:26,311
you definitely recognize.

1552
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:28,311
LAURA: Oh my god, wait! I know those guys!

1553
01:38:28,311 --> 01:38:29,507
SAM: Let's not kill them.

1554
01:38:29,507 --> 01:38:35,240
LAURA: No, but I have a feeling. I feel like Mike
is just crazy enough that he'd be down for this.

1555
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,351
SAM: Like, if we tell him we're vampires, come let
us drink your blood?

1556
01:38:38,351 --> 01:38:40,102
LAURA: I'm going to go talk to Mike for a second.

1557
01:38:40,102 --> 01:38:41,196
SAM: I'm going to come with.

1558
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:44,638
LAURA: Hey, okay, let's go. Hi, Mike.

1559
01:38:44,638 --> 01:38:46,352
TALIESIN: "Hey, oh, Laura! Hey!"

1560
01:38:46,352 --> 01:38:48,294
LAURA: What's up? I know it's been a while.

1561
01:38:48,294 --> 01:38:52,856
TALIESIN: "I know! I know I didn't call you for
the shoot."

1562
01:38:52,856 --> 01:38:57,218
LAURA: No, totally fine, you know, there's a bunch
of stuff going on. Have you seen what's happening

1563
01:38:57,218 --> 01:38:58,782
over at Geek & Sundry?

1564
01:38:58,782 --> 01:39:00,918
TALIESIN: "I mean, I've been really busy."

1565
01:39:00,918 --> 01:39:06,251
LAURA: I totally understand. Hey. I have a quick
question for you.

1566
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:08,072
TALIESIN: "Are you doing a shoot? You've got,
like, a whole--"

1567
01:39:08,072 --> 01:39:09,394
SAM: Yeah, we're doing a shoot.

1568
01:39:09,394 --> 01:39:11,136
LAURA: We're doing a vampire shoot.

1569
01:39:11,136 --> 01:39:13,440
TALIESIN: "That's cool. I've done that. That's
cool."

1570
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:20,532
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty tight. Ti-ti-tight. You
want to say hi to Travis? He's over here.

1571
01:39:20,532 --> 01:39:23,396
TALIESIN: "I mean, yeah. I mean, we're a little
busy."

1572
01:39:23,396 --> 01:39:28,754
LAURA: I know you're busy, but dude. I really
think you want to see him.

1573
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:36,188
TALIESIN: "Are we-- do we got--?" Do you want to
try and--? Give me a charisma persuasion.

1574
01:39:36,188 --> 01:39:37,893
LIAM: Do it.

1575
01:39:37,893 --> 01:39:41,224
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, Mike.

1576
01:39:41,224 --> 01:39:43,708
LIAM: Didn't apologize to Friedle.

1577
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:45,012
TALIESIN: No.

1578
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:52,392
SAM: Don't forget blood. Oh, that's a lot.
Taliesin's brother thinks you're pretty

1579
01:39:52,392 --> 01:39:53,466
charismatic.

1580
01:39:53,466 --> 01:39:54,533
TALIESIN: Yes, he does.

1581
01:39:54,533 --> 01:39:59,175
LAURA: One, two. Just two successes, but no--
well, yeah. No ones at all.

1582
01:39:59,175 --> 01:40:07,605
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you guys can reset this. Yeah,
I've got a second, all right. Show me what you

1583
01:40:07,605 --> 01:40:09,077
"guys are working on. That's cool."

1584
01:40:09,077 --> 01:40:11,054
LAURA: Yeah! I mean, I really think you'll be
interested in this.

1585
01:40:11,054 --> 01:40:14,008
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's into it. Honestly, he's
already pulling out his vape pen.

1586
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:20,891
LAURA: So we're going to make small talk on the
way back over, like, I was wondering if you had

1587
01:40:20,891 --> 01:40:22,948
any Pickleback stuff, because I have been
craving--

1588
01:40:22,948 --> 01:40:25,188
SAM: What is it? Pickleback? What's that?

1589
01:40:25,188 --> 01:40:28,043
LAURA: It's a whiskey shot with pickle juice as
a chaser.

1590
01:40:28,043 --> 01:40:31,940
TALIESIN: I haven't had time to have any fun
lately.

1591
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,211
SAM: I'm Sam, by the way. It's nice to meet you.

1592
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:34,158
LAURA: I'm so sorry, I didn't--

1593
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:36,234
SAM: I do stuff with her on Critical Role.

1594
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:39,659
TALIESIN: "That's cool, you're on the Critical
Role thing too? I hear that's cool."

1595
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:41,029
SAM: It's a dumb show.

1596
01:40:41,029 --> 01:40:43,977
LAURA: We meet up with Travis. Hey, Travis, look!

1597
01:40:43,977 --> 01:40:45,225
TALIESIN: "Hey, what's up, man?"

1598
01:40:45,225 --> 01:40:48,370
LAURA: Our shoot is right around the corner here!
And we take him around the side of the

1599
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:54,708
crypt. But don't kill him!

1600
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:58,340
SAM: I'm going to get down on my hands and knees
for one of those push-over things.

1601
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:05,957
LAURA: No, here's the thing! No! Mike's cool with
it!

1602
01:41:05,957 --> 01:41:07,316
SAM: Push him over!

1603
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:17,805
LAURA: Look, Mike, I have a proposition for you.
Have you ever met a vampire?

1604
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:19,052
TALIESIN: "Yes."

1605
01:41:19,052 --> 01:41:20,695
LAURA: Have they ever sucked your blood?

1606
01:41:20,695 --> 01:41:21,767
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

1607
01:41:21,767 --> 01:41:23,725
LAURA: Would you be willing to go for that again?

1608
01:41:23,725 --> 01:41:28,004
TALIESIN: "Do I get to be a vampire?"

1609
01:41:28,004 --> 01:41:30,459
LAURA: No, you get to be sucked.

1610
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:33,828
SAM: Push him over!

1611
01:41:33,828 --> 01:41:39,855
TALIESIN: "No, no, no! We can work! Okay, I can
make you a deal. We can do a deal with this. This

1612
01:41:39,855 --> 01:41:48,310
"is not my first rodeo. It's Hollywood, I've been
around. You got one round, but I want to be a

1613
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:51,518
"vampire. You got to work that out."

1614
01:41:51,518 --> 01:41:55,912
LAURA: That happens post-bite.

1615
01:41:55,912 --> 01:41:59,820
TALIESIN: You do some work for me, I'm going to do
some work for you.

1616
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:04,487
TRAVIS: I've seen the movies. I'm going to drain
you to life's edge, and then I'll open up my wrist

1617
01:42:04,487 --> 01:42:05,931
and give you a little--

1618
01:42:05,931 --> 01:42:07,949
SAM: Like on True Blood.

1619
01:42:07,949 --> 01:42:10,565
LAURA: Yeah, that's how they did in Interview,
too.

1620
01:42:10,565 --> 01:42:13,113
TALIESIN: "You know, I don't actually know where
you guys are sitting--"

1621
01:42:13,113 --> 01:42:14,865
TRAVIS: I grab him and I throw him into the
crypt.

1622
01:42:14,865 --> 01:42:17,276
(laughter)

1623
01:42:17,276 --> 01:42:18,122
TALIESIN: "Whoa!"

1624
01:42:18,122 --> 01:42:19,476
LAURA: Be nice about it!

1625
01:42:19,476 --> 01:42:23,628
TRAVIS: I take his chin and I go, sorry, Mike! And
I smash his head against the back of the crypt.

1626
01:42:23,628 --> 01:42:27,054
LAURA: What are you doing?! He said he was cool
with it!

1627
01:42:27,054 --> 01:42:29,399
TRAVIS: I'm fucking tired of your bullshit!
(snarling)

1628
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:40,600
TALIESIN: You going for it? All right, give me a
strength brawl plus two. Make a perception roll.

1629
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,479
Perception awareness.

1630
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:47,507
TRAVIS: Five successes, no failures.

1631
01:42:47,507 --> 01:42:52,652
TALIESIN: Ooh, how much do you want to drain him?

1632
01:42:52,652 --> 01:42:54,104
TRAVIS: All the way.

1633
01:42:54,104 --> 01:42:55,867
LAURA: No, you're going to kill Mike?!

1634
01:42:55,867 --> 01:42:59,534
TALIESIN: You're going to destroy my favorite
YouTube channel like that? With no--?

1635
01:42:59,534 --> 01:43:01,274
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.

1636
01:43:01,274 --> 01:43:07,625
LAURA: I rolled three successes. Do I see it
happening? I'm going to try and stop him.

1637
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:08,841
TALIESIN: You're going to try and stop him?

1638
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:11,390
SAM: Vampire on vampire fight?

1639
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:14,468
TALIESIN: All right, really quickly, I need to
double check this.

1640
01:43:14,468 --> 01:43:21,705
LAURA: I love you! (sobbing) No!

1641
01:43:21,705 --> 01:43:25,036
TALIESIN: What's your wits plus brawl?

1642
01:43:25,036 --> 01:43:26,723
LAURA: Wits plus brawl?

1643
01:43:26,723 --> 01:43:28,238
TALIESIN: I know that's weird.

1644
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:32,558
LAURA: Where's wits? It's six.

1645
01:43:32,558 --> 01:43:34,618
TALIESIN: Six together? What's your wits plus
brawl?

1646
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:36,478
TRAVIS: Six.

1647
01:43:36,478 --> 01:43:42,885
TALIESIN: Ooh, both roll a d10. One d10 each.

1648
01:43:42,885 --> 01:43:45,595
LAURA: Did you get a ten?

1649
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:47,294
TRAVIS: No, I got a six.

1650
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:48,638
LAURA: I got a four.

1651
01:43:48,638 --> 01:43:53,342
TALIESIN: You got a six, he got a four? He goes
before you, so he's going to at least get half of

1652
01:43:53,342 --> 01:43:54,724
him drained before--

1653
01:43:54,724 --> 01:43:58,887
LAURA: I want to jump on Travis' back before he
kills him.

1654
01:43:58,887 --> 01:44:03,763
TALIESIN: You jump on his back after he's got--
half your blood pool is empty, and you can decide

1655
01:44:03,763 --> 01:44:05,128
what you do about the--

1656
01:44:05,128 --> 01:44:09,369
LAURA: Travis, don't kill Mike! Don't kill him,
he's human!

1657
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:15,429
TRAVIS: This is not what we want for our friends.
I'll take his head and--

1658
01:44:15,429 --> 01:44:21,079
LAURA: No, no, Travis! Don't kill him! He's fine
with it! He said he was fine with it!

1659
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:23,009
TRAVIS: You want to make him a vampire?

1660
01:44:23,009 --> 01:44:28,962
LAURA: No, I just don't want him to die! He knows
we're vampires, it's fine!

1661
01:44:28,962 --> 01:44:30,179
TRAVIS: Okay.

1662
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:31,340
SAM: He's going to remember now.

1663
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,524
LAURA: No, seriously! I know you're saying okay, I
know you do that! And then you're going to snap

1664
01:44:33,524 --> 01:44:34,501
his neck!

1665
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:37,502
SAM: I don't think Travis knows how to snap
someone's neck. That's a video game thing.

1666
01:44:37,502 --> 01:44:39,244
LAURA: No, he totally would know.

1667
01:44:39,244 --> 01:44:43,312
SAM: How would he know how to snap someone's--?
That's hard to do!

1668
01:44:43,312 --> 01:44:44,865
TALIESIN: This is so dark!

1669
01:44:44,865 --> 01:44:46,816
LIAM: Have you been around the last five
years?

1670
01:44:46,816 --> 01:44:51,157
SAM: I'm sure you've seen it in movies, but it
doesn't just happen like that!

1671
01:44:51,157 --> 01:44:53,196
LAURA: It's really hard to do, I know.

1672
01:44:53,196 --> 01:44:55,370
TRAVIS: So what, you want us to leave him in
here?

1673
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,393
LAURA: No, just wake him up! He's fine!

1674
01:44:57,393 --> 01:45:00,031
TRAVIS: We should walk him back to Manzi.

1675
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:04,031
LAURA: You want to bite Manzi?

1676
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:05,650
TRAVIS: Well, how many of these did I get rid of?

1677
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:08,047
TALIESIN: You can honestly, how hungry were you?

1678
01:45:08,047 --> 01:45:09,575
TRAVIS: I was four blood.

1679
01:45:09,575 --> 01:45:12,588
TALIESIN: I'll say you got three out of your
system.

1680
01:45:12,588 --> 01:45:17,505
LAURA: See, you're fine. We can't get rid of the
last one without killing something. Don't worry

1681
01:45:17,505 --> 01:45:18,466
about it.

1682
01:45:18,466 --> 01:45:21,051
TRAVIS: Fine.

1683
01:45:21,051 --> 01:45:34,271
LAURA: Thank you. Just wake him up and tell him
he's going to be a vampire soon. Mike, Mike! How

1684
01:45:34,271 --> 01:45:35,799
are you?

1685
01:45:35,799 --> 01:45:38,873
TRAVIS: Actually, I pick his head up and I feel
around on the back side. How's the back of the head?

1686
01:45:38,873 --> 01:45:44,024
TALIESIN: He's got a little bump on the head, but
he had just taken a serious vape.

1687
01:45:44,024 --> 01:45:46,617
LAURA: Mike, you fell over! You passed out!

1688
01:45:46,617 --> 01:45:49,901
TALIESIN: "Oh, you totally bit me! Oh!"

1689
01:45:49,901 --> 01:45:51,605
LAURA: You said you wanted us to!

1690
01:45:51,605 --> 01:45:54,380
TALIESIN: "Give some warning, man! Oh god!"

1691
01:45:54,380 --> 01:46:00,841
LAURA: That's how you turn into a vampire. So be
ready. You're probably going to turn in the next

1692
01:46:00,841 --> 01:46:01,950
few days.

1693
01:46:01,950 --> 01:46:11,451
TALIESIN: "I'm going to go back to my shoot."

1694
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:13,972
LAURA: Yeah, they've been looking for you, I
think.

1695
01:46:13,972 --> 01:46:19,274
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you guys need to figure your shit
out. Jesus."

1696
01:46:19,274 --> 01:46:20,302
LAURA: Have a fun shoot!

1697
01:46:20,302 --> 01:46:24,601
TALIESIN: "Argh, ow. God."

1698
01:46:24,601 --> 01:46:26,389
TRAVIS: Sorry, Mike. Nothing personal.

1699
01:46:26,389 --> 01:46:29,983
TALIESIN: "Dude, not cool. Not cool."

1700
01:46:29,983 --> 01:46:35,886
TRAVIS: You made me feel bad. You get to kill
random Smart Girl people, and Mike gets away.

1701
01:46:35,886 --> 01:46:40,923
LAURA: It's like I said, when we were in the
offices, everything was weird, and it seemed okay,

1702
01:46:40,923 --> 01:46:43,160
and now that we're out there's humans around!

1703
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,897
TRAVIS: It's okay for you, just not cool for other
people, huh?

1704
01:46:44,897 --> 01:46:47,560
SAM: Well, I mean, all of us have killed except
for you, at this point.

1705
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,921
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty much.

1706
01:46:48,921 --> 01:46:53,778
LIAM: I come waltzing up. Oh my god, I just did a
bump of Friedle. I mean, I just bumped into

1707
01:46:53,778 --> 01:46:59,112
Friedle. It's crazy, the odds. Yeah! He's here!

1708
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,435
TRAVIS: Is he a vampire?

1709
01:47:00,435 --> 01:47:03,616
LIAM: No, he is not a vampire. He had to go.

1710
01:47:03,616 --> 01:47:06,192
TRAVIS: He had to leave? He couldn't say hi to us
first?

1711
01:47:06,192 --> 01:47:08,287
LIAM: (sucking noise)

1712
01:47:08,287 --> 01:47:09,741
LAURA: Oh, that's creepy.

1713
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:11,220
SAM: You killed Will Friedle.

1714
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,529
TRAVIS: Did you leave him alive?

1715
01:47:12,529 --> 01:47:14,294
LIAM: Sure.

1716
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:16,482
SAM: I feel like we've taken a plunge here.

1717
01:47:16,482 --> 01:47:21,010
LAURA: You have poop on you. I can smell poop on
you.

1718
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:22,517
TRAVIS: We're really supposed to be meeting up
with someone.

1719
01:47:22,517 --> 01:47:25,625
TALIESIN: Kotori and Mahlo are looking at you guys
a little like--

1720
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:28,523
TRAVIS: We told you we were new. Sorry. We're just
trying to flush this out.

1721
01:47:28,523 --> 01:47:31,018
LAURA: God, I'm so sorry you had to witness all of
this.

1722
01:47:31,018 --> 01:47:35,193
TRAVIS: Enough delays. We should really go. We
have a promise to keep.

1723
01:47:35,193 --> 01:47:40,799
TALIESIN: "Totes. We'll take you to where you need
to go." And we're going to take a break while we

1724
01:47:40,799 --> 01:47:48,324
take a gentle stroll to Los Globos. That got so
weird. I'm so pleased. I hope, now that Mike has

1725
01:47:48,324 --> 01:47:51,981
survived, I hope you all take a moment to go check
out his YouTube channel. It's quite

1726
01:47:51,981 --> 01:47:58,509
pleasing. Mike Diva. Thank you guys, we'll be back
in a few minutes. There's also going to be a

1727
01:47:58,509 --> 01:48:03,445
giveaway in the chat, but I think that's all going
to be in the little video. There's going to be a

1728
01:48:03,445 --> 01:48:07,738
video about the password. Otherwise, we have
dice.

1729
01:48:07,738 --> 01:48:09,078
LAURA: And we have coasters.

1730
01:48:09,078 --> 01:48:15,701
TALIESIN: Coasters, and thank you Tor Books. We
will continue with this madness when we come back

1731
01:48:15,701 --> 01:48:19,984
from a little bit of a snack. Cake.

1732
01:48:19,984 --> 02:08:52,338
[break]

1733
02:08:54,566 --> 02:08:57,506
TALIESIN: That's a lie. The cake is a lie.

1734
02:08:57,525 --> 02:08:59,087
LAURA: It was so good.

1735
02:08:59,118 --> 02:09:03,720
TALIESIN: It was actually a really good cake! I
feel a little guilty for eating it. The winner, by

1736
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:13,873
the way, of our contest in the chat room was
Sharpe_liquid. Sharpe liquid. Congratulations!

1737
02:09:13,893 --> 02:09:20,502
That's a great little call sign. That's pretty
cool. I hope you guys are enjoying this

1738
02:09:20,502 --> 02:09:23,950
ridiculousness. I had to take some layers off
because it's really hot!

1739
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:28,166
LIAM: Ridiculous! This is very serious.

1740
02:09:28,166 --> 02:09:30,446
TALIESIN: So serious. This is super, super
serious.

1741
02:09:30,456 --> 02:09:31,833
SAM: (loud burp)

1742
02:09:31,843 --> 02:09:33,991
LAURA: Wow! Did you feel better?

1743
02:09:33,991 --> 02:09:37,658
SAM: Yep. Sorry.

1744
02:09:37,668 --> 02:09:39,704
LAURA: Let's do this.

1745
02:09:39,704 --> 02:09:41,023
TALIESIN: Are we doing this?

1746
02:09:41,023 --> 02:09:43,787
LIAM: The eyebrows though...

1747
02:09:43,787 --> 02:09:54,142
TALIESIN: (Pac-Man noises) So where were we?
That's right, let me get my volume back up.

1748
02:09:54,142 --> 02:09:57,562
TRAVIS: We were just about to kill Mike Diva.

1749
02:09:57,562 --> 02:09:59,280
LAURA: No, Mike Diva's alive.

1750
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:04,629
TALIESIN: Can't kill Mike Diva. Mika Diva's got to
do his thing, man. There's no stopping Mike Diva.

1751
02:10:04,629 --> 02:10:06,995
TRAVIS: You get one.

1752
02:10:06,995 --> 02:10:10,980
TALIESIN: No, there is definitely some stopping
Will Friedle. You can leave Will Friedle at the

1753
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:13,741
bottom of the blue tank.

1754
02:10:13,741 --> 02:10:15,464
LIAM: Marinating right now.

1755
02:10:15,464 --> 02:10:17,121
TALIESIN: Slowly dissolving.

1756
02:10:17,121 --> 02:10:19,830
LAURA: I hope we make it out of LA before people
find his body.

1757
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:22,047
LIAM: Who's going to find it?

1758
02:10:22,047 --> 02:10:24,785
LAURA: The cleaners. The porta potty cleaners.

1759
02:10:24,785 --> 02:10:26,642
LIAM: You don't know about his body.

1760
02:10:26,642 --> 02:10:32,957
TALIESIN: They are going to find his body. That is
going to be a problem for another game. It's

1761
02:10:32,957 --> 02:10:37,264
somebody else's Vampire game is going to run into
Will Friedle's body.

1762
02:10:37,264 --> 02:10:38,845
LAURA: Do I have cake in my teeth?

1763
02:10:38,845 --> 02:10:41,074
SAM: Nope. You got other stuff, but not cake.

1764
02:10:41,074 --> 02:10:49,140
TALIESIN: So we had left the cemetery and its
roving hipsters and film crews and Will Friedle.

1765
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:56,786
We're slowly making our way through the city, up
to--

1766
02:10:56,786 --> 02:11:03,002
TRAVIS: I just realized Liam has the habit of
killing NPCs before they ever utter a word. Well,

1767
02:11:03,002 --> 02:11:05,020
I guess he protested through the door.

1768
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:11,882
TALIESIN: This is why every person that we know
who I know I can't do an impression of, I just

1769
02:11:11,882 --> 02:11:17,423
introduce them to Liam and I know it's never going
to be a problem. Should have just given you Mary

1770
02:11:17,423 --> 02:11:24,268
Elizabeth, that would have just been easy peasy,
because I can't do that. We make our way slowly up

1771
02:11:24,268 --> 02:11:35,813
to Sunset Boulevard, where you are brought to the
door of Los Globos, a skeezy-looking club. It's

1772
02:11:35,813 --> 02:11:39,655
maybe two, three stories. It's hard to tell. It's
built into a hill. It's hard to get an idea of the

1773
02:11:39,655 --> 02:11:46,457
place. You can't tell how big it is, really. It's
just got a big red fiery sign that says "Los

1774
02:11:46,918 --> 02:11:50,487
Globos" on the front and there's a doorman in
there.

1775
02:11:50,516 --> 02:11:51,919
LAURA: Is he a vampire?

1776
02:11:52,663 --> 02:11:53,586
TALIESIN: You don't know.

1777
02:11:54,218 --> 02:11:54,999
LAURA: You can't tell?

1778
02:11:55,065 --> 02:11:56,456
TALIESIN: You can't tell. I could tell.

1779
02:11:56,478 --> 02:11:57,498
LIAM: What's Los Globos?

1780
02:11:57,677 --> 02:11:59,665
LAURA: It's a club where vampires are!

1781
02:11:59,671 --> 02:12:00,792
LIAM: But what does it mean?

1782
02:12:00,811 --> 02:12:01,985
LAURA: The globes?

1783
02:12:02,227 --> 02:12:04,589
SAM: The balls, the balloons. Something like that.

1784
02:12:05,410 --> 02:12:07,147
LIAM: G.L.A.B.O.S.?

1785
02:12:08,169 --> 02:12:10,726
TRAVIS: I would like to use Google Translate.

1786
02:12:11,951 --> 02:12:15,588
TALIESIN: You don't have a phone, man. You could
have taken Diva's phone, but you didn't think

1787
02:12:15,588 --> 02:12:16,723
about that, did you?

1788
02:12:16,723 --> 02:12:17,728
LAURA: Oh, that would have been so smart!

1789
02:12:18,114 --> 02:12:18,936
TRAVIS: What about my iWatch?

1790
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:25,041
TALIESIN: Man, they took all your good shit before
they put you in anything in order to stay. Lock

1791
02:12:25,057 --> 02:12:36,367
and Mahlo take a second and show you inside. Lock
comes forward. "The ones you're looking for are

1792
02:12:36,367 --> 02:12:39,272
inside. Good luck."

1793
02:12:39,297 --> 02:12:43,657
SAM: What are they? What kind of creature are
they? Are they vampires?

1794
02:12:43,657 --> 02:12:44,948
TALIESIN: "Vampires."

1795
02:12:44,956 --> 02:12:46,206
SAM: And what are their names?

1796
02:12:46,206 --> 02:12:47,126
TALIESIN: "I don't know."

1797
02:12:47,126 --> 02:12:49,651
SAM: How will we know it's them?

1798
02:12:49,651 --> 02:12:56,950
TALIESIN: "Good luck." And they peace out. They
are out and leaving you to your own devices here.

1799
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:58,979
TRAVIS: Are we inside or are we outside the club?

1800
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:03,797
TALIESIN: You're currently outside, although the
bouncer inside has witnessed enough of this and

1801
02:13:03,797 --> 02:13:11,049
seems deeply unimpressed by two lizard people
having this conversation, that he's just sitting

1802
02:13:11,049 --> 02:13:13,010
with his clicker, waiting for you guys to walk
in.

1803
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:14,648
LAURA: I smile at him.

1804
02:13:14,648 --> 02:13:16,145
SAM: We don't have IDs.

1805
02:13:16,145 --> 02:13:19,561
LAURA: I'm trying to make you smile back at me.

1806
02:13:19,561 --> 02:13:22,365
TALIESIN: "You don't need IDs. You're fine."

1807
02:13:22,365 --> 02:13:24,552
SAM: Because we look old.

1808
02:13:24,552 --> 02:13:32,734
TALIESIN: "You do, yeah." Click. Click.

1809
02:13:32,734 --> 02:13:34,521
TRAVIS: At the door? Then we go right in?

1810
02:13:34,521 --> 02:13:37,691
TALIESIN: Yeah. The lizard people brought you in.

1811
02:13:37,691 --> 02:13:39,336
LAURA: Did he smile at us?

1812
02:13:39,336 --> 02:13:40,273
TALIESIN: Nah.

1813
02:13:40,273 --> 02:13:41,560
LAURA: Damn it.

1814
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:43,216
SAM: We don't have any money. We can't buy
anything in here.

1815
02:13:43,216 --> 02:13:44,072
TALIESIN: No.

1816
02:13:44,072 --> 02:13:46,023
LAURA: I don't think we're trying to get drunk,
Sam.

1817
02:13:46,023 --> 02:13:47,890
SAM: Well, I don't know. To fit in?

1818
02:13:47,890 --> 02:13:58,020
TALIESIN: You walk through a pretty scummy
hallway. It's definitely sticky in here and it's

1819
02:13:58,020 --> 02:13:59,620
dark and there's some thumping music.

1820
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:01,141
TRAVIS: Hemoglobin sticky or alcohol sticky?

1821
02:14:01,141 --> 02:14:02,337
TALIESIN: Alcohol sticky.

1822
02:14:02,337 --> 02:14:07,958
LAURA: It's like a Blade club where they bring
humans in and then when the music hits, then

1823
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:09,397
everybody gets bit?

1824
02:14:09,397 --> 02:14:13,681
SAM: I never understood why would anyone go into
those clubs if people were dying all the time.

1825
02:14:13,681 --> 02:14:20,341
TALIESIN: Because that's just the best club. There
is for reasons of a) that I don't want you

1826
02:14:20,341 --> 02:14:24,420
screaming over each other and b) finding music
that I could have used on short notice is just

1827
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:30,618
ridiculous, there is thumping, dropping industrial
music in this club. There are people dancing.

1828
02:14:30,618 --> 02:14:32,751
LAURA: I start dancing.

1829
02:14:32,751 --> 02:14:39,036
TALIESIN: It's definitely a goth industrial club.
There's some hairstyles, there's multicolored

1830
02:14:39,036 --> 02:14:44,097
hair. There's a lot of people wearing black
clothing. There is a lot of lights and laser

1831
02:14:44,097 --> 02:14:50,451
effects. There's a DJ doing his job, who's a
little old and craggily. And there is nothing you

1832
02:14:50,451 --> 02:14:53,219
recognize off the top of your head, but it looks
like a decent goth club.

1833
02:14:53,219 --> 02:14:55,414
LIAM: Can I get a drink out of habit?

1834
02:14:55,452 --> 02:14:57,199
SAM and LAURA: We have no money.

1835
02:14:57,199 --> 02:15:00,998
LIAM: We don't? There's nothing in my pants
anymore?

1836
02:15:00,998 --> 02:15:02,866
LAURA: No, they took all of our stuff.

1837
02:15:02,866 --> 02:15:03,963
LIAM: Just all my shit?

1838
02:15:03,963 --> 02:15:08,275
SAM: We can barter some blood or something. I
don't know. Maybe you could convince him with your charms!

1839
02:15:08,275 --> 02:15:11,709
LAURA: Maybe, check and see if the bartender is a
vampire.

1840
02:15:11,709 --> 02:15:18,195
SAM: Are there ladies on the dance floor?

1841
02:15:18,195 --> 02:15:20,854
TALIESIN: There are men, women and definitely--

1842
02:15:20,854 --> 02:15:22,712
TRAVIS: I'll look for a VIP area.

1843
02:15:22,712 --> 02:15:24,399
TALIESIN: You want to look for a VIP area?

1844
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:26,209
LAURA: I'm gonna dance too. I'm definitely dancing
too.

1845
02:15:26,209 --> 02:15:32,478
TALIESIN: You got to watch my guide to goth
dancing. You're doing fine but that's okay. You're

1846
02:15:32,478 --> 02:15:34,212
doing the Pac-Man. That's cool.

1847
02:15:34,212 --> 02:15:36,135
SAM: Glow-sticks.

1848
02:15:36,135 --> 02:15:39,741
TALIESIN: Give me a perception awareness roll for
the VIP lounge.

1849
02:15:39,741 --> 02:15:41,241
TRAVIS: Okay.

1850
02:15:41,241 --> 02:15:45,951
TALIESIN: If you're thinking about how you're
going to get a drink, I'm fascinated.

1851
02:15:45,951 --> 02:15:48,443
LIAM: I'll just say, hey, how's the night going?

1852
02:15:48,443 --> 02:15:58,174
TALIESIN: "It's fine. Yeah." So you know, guy in
his mid-30s, short haircut, black t-shirt.

1853
02:15:58,174 --> 02:16:02,406
Obviously he's probably here five nights a week
and for five different clubs.

1854
02:16:02,406 --> 02:16:08,260
LIAM: Jeez, you have a big smile. I know that's
weird to say.

1855
02:16:08,295 --> 02:16:09,525
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

1856
02:16:09,525 --> 02:16:10,922
TRAVIS: You've never been in a bar before.

1857
02:16:10,922 --> 02:16:13,995
(laughter)

1858
02:16:13,995 --> 02:16:20,035
LIAM: No, I have a friend with a, it's dumb, but a
huge smile. Like teeth as big as the Hollywood

1859
02:16:20,148 --> 02:16:21,497
sign. Gorgeous.

1860
02:16:21,497 --> 02:16:25,349
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Can I get you something?"

1861
02:16:25,349 --> 02:16:27,108
LIAM: Yeah, what's good tonight?

1862
02:16:27,108 --> 02:16:29,415
LAURA: The alcohol!

1863
02:16:29,415 --> 02:16:35,903
TALIESIN: "Beer on tap. We do a couple absinthe
drinks, but they're overpriced. What do you want?"

1864
02:16:35,903 --> 02:16:43,519
LIAM: Oh god. I would love an absinthe, but I lost
my wallet. I guess just beer on tap. Could I

1865
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:44,912
leave a card?

1866
02:16:44,912 --> 02:16:46,801
TALIESIN: "Yep. Card and ID?"

1867
02:16:46,801 --> 02:16:52,533
LIAM: God, I don't have that. God, I am up shit
creek.

1868
02:16:52,533 --> 02:16:56,011
LAURA: Can you imagine if somebody walked up to the
bartender doing this shit? He'd be like, get

1869
02:16:56,011 --> 02:16:56,839
the fuck out.

1870
02:16:56,839 --> 02:17:01,977
TALIESIN: I have seen weirder interactions with
bartenders. This is nowhere near the weirdest

1871
02:17:01,977 --> 02:17:03,061
interaction.

1872
02:17:03,061 --> 02:17:05,674
LIAM: It's no question that the three of you want
me to fail. It's fine. I'm used to it.

1873
02:17:05,674 --> 02:17:09,123
TALIESIN: I don't want you to fail! Are you going
to use Presence Awe?

1874
02:17:09,123 --> 02:17:10,532
LIAM: Yes I am.

1875
02:17:10,532 --> 02:17:16,880
TALIESIN: All right. Give me a 1d10 blood check
and then--

1876
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:20,317
LIAM: I'm used to it, Laura. Don't worry. Three.

1877
02:17:20,317 --> 02:17:26,910
TALIESIN: Ooh, where did it go? Three. Where's my
blood pool? Yep, you get one hunger.

1878
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:30,763
LIAM: Okay, cool. Good thing I drained Friedle.

1879
02:17:30,763 --> 02:17:34,974
TRAVIS: I had three successes on looking for the
VIP area.

1880
02:17:34,974 --> 02:17:43,521
TALIESIN: Yes, you notice actually, in a gothic
red sign, there's a little velvet rope and a sign

1881
02:17:43,521 --> 02:17:48,253
that reads, "Food is only served in the VIP
lounge."

1882
02:17:48,253 --> 02:17:52,972
TRAVIS: Is there a bouncer?

1883
02:17:52,972 --> 02:18:00,399
TALIESIN: There is a big bouncer. Very big, pale,
older-looking gentleman.

1884
02:18:00,399 --> 02:18:08,518
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to him. We're supposed to meet
someone in here.

1885
02:18:08,518 --> 02:18:11,939
TALIESIN: "You have a name on the list?"

1886
02:18:11,939 --> 02:18:22,747
TRAVIS: We're probably not, but me and my three
friends are new to this scene. My name is Travis.

1887
02:18:22,747 --> 02:18:30,678
TALIESIN: "Okay. Well, I would recommend getting
on the list."

1888
02:18:30,678 --> 02:18:34,346
TRAVIS: How does one go about getting on the
list?

1889
02:18:34,346 --> 02:18:35,973
TALIESIN: "I don't know, man."

1890
02:18:35,973 --> 02:18:39,106
TRAVIS: Does he seem like a human?

1891
02:18:39,106 --> 02:18:47,098
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence investigation
check. I'm going to get weird on this one. Give me

1892
02:18:47,098 --> 02:18:48,920
intelligence occult.

1893
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:56,026
TRAVIS: One success, no failures.

1894
02:18:56,026 --> 02:19:00,083
TALIESIN: You have no idea. He's big.

1895
02:19:00,083 --> 02:19:06,368
TRAVIS: While I am standing at the rope talking to
this gentleman, can I look and see who I see in

1896
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:09,043
the VIP area? A lot of people, a few people?

1897
02:19:09,043 --> 02:19:12,520
TALIESIN: It's up the stairs. It's a little hard
to see. You can't quite tell who's up there.

1898
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:18,267
There's a rope and then it goes upstairs and
there, it turns a corner. It's practically a

1899
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:19,660
different club.

1900
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:23,270
TRAVIS: Fantastic. I'll be back once we're on the
list. Thanks for your time. And I go find Sam.

1901
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:24,842
TALIESIN: "Good luck."

1902
02:19:24,994 --> 02:19:27,455
LIAM: I never did Presence Awe. For getting
that hunger.

1903
02:19:27,455 --> 02:19:29,765
TALIESIN: You've got to roll it now.

1904
02:19:29,844 --> 02:19:33,149
LIAM: Yep, sure. Just one success, no failures.

1905
02:19:33,149 --> 02:19:52,224
TALIESIN: He gives you a look over. "Are you sure
that this is the bar you want to be drinking at?"

1906
02:19:52,224 --> 02:19:54,561
LIAM: Absolutely.

1907
02:19:54,561 --> 02:20:03,537
TALIESIN: "Are you sure that you wouldn't rather
have something from the cocktail list?" Oh my god,

1908
02:20:03,537 --> 02:20:09,728
dude. This dance battle is killing me.

1909
02:20:09,728 --> 02:20:14,504
LIAM: I mean, I gotcha. That is what we're here
for. Do you see the guy over there with the

1910
02:20:14,504 --> 02:20:17,720
gigantic smile that looks like Pac-Man with the
huge teeth? Yeah.

1911
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:19,181
TALIESIN: "It's hard to miss."

1912
02:20:19,181 --> 02:20:23,837
LIAM: That's my guy. He was newly christened
tonight and the rest of us want to celebrate.

1913
02:20:23,837 --> 02:20:31,181
TALIESIN: "Oh man, that's a lot of info. You
should probably be upstairs, man."

1914
02:20:31,181 --> 02:20:33,128
LIAM: I do want to see the cocktail list.

1915
02:20:33,128 --> 02:20:39,421
TALIESIN: "Yeah. You've got a name, just drop a
name at the front. They'll let you right in."

1916
02:20:39,421 --> 02:20:45,145
LIAM: Just drop it at the front? Okay.

1917
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:47,422
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you're fine. You'll be fine, but
no trouble down here. We keep this clean."

1918
02:20:47,422 --> 02:20:50,733
LIAM: Sure. All right. Could I get an Old
Fashioned? Would that be all right?

1919
02:20:50,733 --> 02:20:53,288
TALIESIN: "Sure."

1920
02:20:53,288 --> 02:20:56,247
LAURA: It's gonna taste like shit.

1921
02:20:56,247 --> 02:20:59,712
TALIESIN: And he makes a club Old Fashioned.

1922
02:20:59,712 --> 02:21:01,822
LIAM: Just for old times' sake.

1923
02:21:01,822 --> 02:21:07,359
TALIESIN: What's muddled? He muddles the fruit,
like he just reminds it that it's ordinary and

1924
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:08,633
then hands it off.

1925
02:21:08,633 --> 02:21:13,598
LIAM: Every once in a while, I remind myself what I
left behind. What does that taste like?

1926
02:21:13,598 --> 02:21:24,814
TALIESIN: It tastes like gasoline. It's awful. It
burns. It doesn't feel good. It's petrol.

1927
02:21:24,814 --> 02:21:26,862
LIAM: Yeah. Better off.

1928
02:21:26,862 --> 02:21:30,010
LAURA: Sam and I have started line dancing.

1929
02:21:30,010 --> 02:21:37,638
SAM: Wait, are there any young ladies on the dance
floor that I can maybe chat up?

1930
02:21:37,638 --> 02:21:39,778
TALIESIN: You've never been to a goth club, have
you?

1931
02:21:39,778 --> 02:21:40,891
SAM: Nope.

1932
02:21:40,891 --> 02:21:42,872
TALIESIN: You can certainly try.

1933
02:21:42,872 --> 02:21:52,837
SAM: I'll pick one and say: Excuse me! Hey. Excuse
me. Hey. Do you come here a lot?

1934
02:21:52,837 --> 02:21:55,332
LIAM: Please tell me it's Lauryn Ipsum.

1935
02:21:55,332 --> 02:22:06,789
TALIESIN: Oh man. Oh Lauryn, oh dear. It's a girl
with a large blue mohawk and a bunch of metal

1936
02:22:06,789 --> 02:22:15,135
barbs tied into the large blue mohawk. She is
doing this heavy interpretive dance. She takes a

1937
02:22:15,135 --> 02:22:18,169
look at you, spins around and an elbow goes right
into your chest.

1938
02:22:18,169 --> 02:22:25,250
SAM: Does it stir anything in me? Do I have an
urge to kill her or anything like that?

1939
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:26,935
TALIESIN: What's your--

1940
02:22:26,935 --> 02:22:28,314
SAM: One.

1941
02:22:28,314 --> 02:22:30,718
TALIESIN: No. You're hungry, but you're fine.

1942
02:22:30,718 --> 02:22:38,236
SAM: I'll continue. I'll spin her back around and
say, that was so hardcore!

1943
02:22:38,236 --> 02:22:42,710
TALIESIN: Suddenly, a completely different elbow
ends up in your chest. From somebody else, there

1944
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:44,803
is another.

1945
02:22:44,803 --> 02:22:47,716
SAM: This is not the Electric Slide I grew up
with!

1946
02:22:47,716 --> 02:22:52,950
TALIESIN: There's a guy with long black hair and
he's wearing a little tie and a nice vest and

1947
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:55,208
suddenly another elbow is right in your
chest.

1948
02:22:55,208 --> 02:23:01,809
LAURA: I walk over to Sam and be like: You just
don't. Trust me. Just don't.

1949
02:23:01,809 --> 02:23:05,406
TALIESIN: And that's what happens when you try and
hit on people on the dance floor at a goth club.

1950
02:23:05,406 --> 02:23:08,694
TRAVIS: I make my way over to Laura and Sam. I'm like,
Sam, I need your-- what are you doing?

1951
02:23:08,788 --> 02:23:11,248
SAM: I'm working this girl right here. I think I'm
going to--

1952
02:23:11,248 --> 02:23:13,524
TALIESIN: The girl turns to you and goes, "He's
really not."

1953
02:23:13,614 --> 02:23:16,753
TRAVIS: My apologies. I pull him off the dance
floor with Laura.

1954
02:23:16,753 --> 02:23:18,101
LAURA: Me too?

1955
02:23:18,101 --> 02:23:23,814
TRAVIS: Yeah. So there is a VIP lounge but we
apparently need to be on the list. I don't know

1956
02:23:23,814 --> 02:23:27,376
how to do that. You're fast as shit. How about I
distract or--

1957
02:23:27,376 --> 02:23:28,865
SAM: Is there a clipboard list?

1958
02:23:28,865 --> 02:23:30,539
TRAVIS: Maybe.

1959
02:23:30,539 --> 02:23:32,245
LAURA: I could sneak past him!

1960
02:23:32,245 --> 02:23:34,113
TALIESIN: You seem to recall he had an iPhone.

1961
02:23:34,113 --> 02:23:43,820
SAM: Well, I could super-fast try to type one on
his iPhone, but that seems like he's going to

1962
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:45,661
catch me, right? I'm not that fast.

1963
02:23:45,661 --> 02:23:48,038
TRAVIS: Or if there's a payphone at the bar we could
call and pretend to be--

1964
02:23:48,038 --> 02:23:49,791
SAM: If you distract him, I could whiz by him.

1965
02:23:49,791 --> 02:23:51,651
TRAVIS: She's also nigh-invisible.

1966
02:23:51,651 --> 02:23:57,208
SAM: We could both. And then we could come out and be
like, hey, let our friends in.

1967
02:23:57,208 --> 02:23:58,975
LAURA: Oh, our friends. Yeah, that's good.

1968
02:23:58,975 --> 02:23:59,901
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

1969
02:23:59,901 --> 02:24:01,637
SAM: Okay, how are you going to distract him?

1970
02:24:01,637 --> 02:24:10,767
TRAVIS; I got it. So I walk back up to the bouncer
and I start in the normal roped area and I move to

1971
02:24:10,767 --> 02:24:18,328
his opposite side so that he has to follow me with
his vision. The thing about fingers is you

1972
02:24:18,328 --> 02:24:22,812
don't really need all of them. And I'll snap this
finger off. Just break it right there.

1973
02:24:22,812 --> 02:24:24,440
LAURA: Why?

1974
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,613
TALIESIN: Can you do that?

1975
02:24:25,613 --> 02:24:26,881
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1976
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:28,319
TALIESIN: This is a trick or are you really doing
it?

1977
02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:29,701
TRAVIS: I'm really breaking my own finger.

1978
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:39,927
TALIESIN: You just want me to say stanima, and I'm
going to do it for you. Stanima. Oh man, I'm going

1979
02:24:39,927 --> 02:24:44,743
to add survival. I know that's weird, but I'm
adding survival to this. Stanima and survival.

1980
02:24:44,743 --> 02:24:48,528
Stanima. I'm saying it.

1981
02:24:48,528 --> 02:24:52,006
LAURA: I'm going to go over against the wall in
the dark and Obfuscate.

1982
02:24:52,006 --> 02:24:53,670
TRAVIS: Three successes, no failures.

1983
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:58,077
TALIESIN: You're even doing the hands right. Yeah,
you do not even break eye contact with him, do you?

1984
02:24:58,077 --> 02:24:59,938
TRAVIS: I'll just (cracking sound).

1985
02:24:59,938 --> 02:25:05,075
TALIESIN: "Dude, what's wrong with you, man?"

1986
02:25:05,075 --> 02:25:07,744
SAM: Is he distracted?

1987
02:25:07,744 --> 02:25:09,416
TRAVIS: It normally stays--

1988
02:25:09,416 --> 02:25:12,254
TALIESIN: He's definitely staring at a broken
finger.

1989
02:25:12,254 --> 02:25:15,364
SAM: I'm going to wait and see if Laura
gets through before I dash.

1990
02:25:15,364 --> 02:25:17,237
LAURA: You can't even see me.

1991
02:25:17,237 --> 02:25:18,842
SAM: Oh. Well, that's why.

1992
02:25:18,842 --> 02:25:20,902
TALIESIN: You're going to wait a while.

1993
02:25:20,902 --> 02:25:22,139
LAURA: Can I try to go?

1994
02:25:22,139 --> 02:25:23,216
TALIESIN: You can try to go.

1995
02:25:23,216 --> 02:25:24,885
LAURA: And do I need to roll to Obfuscate?

1996
02:25:24,885 --> 02:25:26,654
TALIESIN: Let me double-check, because--

1997
02:25:26,654 --> 02:25:28,676
LAURA: I roll my hunger roll?

1998
02:25:28,676 --> 02:25:31,806
TALIESIN: You got to roll a 1d10 and tell me what
you get.

1999
02:25:31,806 --> 02:25:33,132
LAURA: Three.

2000
02:25:33,132 --> 02:25:38,405
TALIESIN: You are now one more hunger die up, but
I think you could just do it. I'm just

2001
02:25:38,405 --> 02:25:39,661
double-checking, because--

2002
02:25:39,661 --> 02:25:41,892
LAURA: Hunger roll, wits and stealth.

2003
02:25:41,892 --> 02:25:47,475
TALIESIN: Oh, now you have to roll wits and
stealth. Thank you, I was looking for that.

2004
02:25:47,475 --> 02:25:50,399
LAURA: Like you do!

2005
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:58,343
SAM: What's going on under the Pac-Man suit? You
don't know.

2006
02:25:58,343 --> 02:26:02,501
LAURA: Two successes.

2007
02:26:02,501 --> 02:26:12,730
TALIESIN: He rolled really poorly and he was
pretty distracted. Yeah, you would have my

2008
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:16,495
undivided attention. I'm just saying that if you
broke a finger in front of me, I would not be

2009
02:26:16,495 --> 02:26:17,936
looking at anything else.

2010
02:26:17,936 --> 02:26:20,859
TRAVIS: I'm hoping that vampires have amazing
regenerative powers.

2011
02:26:20,859 --> 02:26:27,983
TALIESIN: That's actually a good point. I think
you definitely have to take a point of damage, so

2012
02:26:27,983 --> 02:26:30,994
just mark off that you just took a point of
damage.

2013
02:26:30,994 --> 02:26:32,482
LAURA: Is that on your health?

2014
02:26:32,482 --> 02:26:35,888
TALIESIN: Yeah, under the health bar. Just put a
line through one of those.

2015
02:26:35,888 --> 02:26:39,356
LAURA: What is this health and humanity stuff that we
haven't even looked at yet?

2016
02:26:39,356 --> 02:26:43,619
TALIESIN: Humanity, we're ignoring because it's
because I'm deciding that it's far more

2017
02:26:43,619 --> 02:26:46,388
interesting to play with when you have a longer,
more complicated game.

2018
02:26:46,388 --> 02:26:48,744
LIAM: Humanity is in the porta potty with Friedle
right now.

2019
02:26:48,744 --> 02:26:50,504
TALIESIN: It's sadly, at the moment, we've dropped
humanity.

2020
02:26:50,504 --> 02:26:52,525
SAM: Did I see Laura get through?

2021
02:26:52,525 --> 02:26:56,503
TALIESIN: No. She's nigh invisible.

2022
02:26:56,503 --> 02:26:59,062
SAM: Well then, is he still distracted?

2023
02:26:59,062 --> 02:27:00,949
TALIESIN: He's still staring at a finger.

2024
02:27:00,949 --> 02:27:02,386
SAM: I'm going to bolt past him.

2025
02:27:02,386 --> 02:27:03,749
TALIESIN: All right. Roll a d10.

2026
02:27:03,749 --> 02:27:06,031
SAM: Just 1d10? Two.

2027
02:27:06,031 --> 02:27:07,390
TRAVIS: What if I pulled it out?

2028
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:08,718
TALIESIN: You got a hunger die.

2029
02:27:08,718 --> 02:27:10,003
SAM: Don't worry, I have plenty over here.

2030
02:27:10,003 --> 02:27:22,453
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm throwing them out anyway as
it makes me feel excited. Let's do dexterity and

2031
02:27:22,453 --> 02:27:24,830
dodge to see if you can get past this guy.

2032
02:27:24,830 --> 02:27:26,366
SAM: Ooh, not good.

2033
02:27:26,366 --> 02:27:27,651
TALIESIN: It's okay. He's distracted.

2034
02:27:27,651 --> 02:27:35,183
SAM: Well okay, that's one roll. Oh wait, that has
to be another hunger dice. Oh wait, that knocked

2035
02:27:35,183 --> 02:27:41,526
that one over! This is one success, one blood
fail.

2036
02:27:41,526 --> 02:27:56,288
TALIESIN: One blood fail. I think you stand there,
staring for a little while at where Laura was,

2037
02:27:56,288 --> 02:28:02,375
wondering if she was going to go. And you stand
there and stare for so long that you don't realize

2038
02:28:02,375 --> 02:28:09,011
that he is actually-- the bouncer is like, "I'm
going to go get you some gauze or something, man.

2039
02:28:09,011 --> 02:28:10,836
"No, I'll be right back."

2040
02:28:10,836 --> 02:28:14,376
TRAVIS: You don't even really-- is it bleeding?

2041
02:28:14,376 --> 02:28:16,337
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's nasty, man."

2042
02:28:16,337 --> 02:28:17,570
TRAVIS: Is the bone out?

2043
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:23,259
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that's a little nasty." He's
going to walk to the bar and once he goes to the

2044
02:28:23,259 --> 02:28:25,199
bar, you make a dash up.

2045
02:28:25,199 --> 02:28:27,265
LAURA: We can all go up. The bouncer's gone. Let's
go!

2046
02:28:27,265 --> 02:28:29,759
TRAVIS: Is he going to be looking for me? You got
to do what you need to do.

2047
02:28:29,759 --> 02:28:31,200
SAM: What, you're going to stay?

2048
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:35,105
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's four of us. Three go. Go!

2049
02:28:35,105 --> 02:28:38,514
SAM: Oh god. Does it hurt?

2050
02:28:38,514 --> 02:28:44,019
TRAVIS: Not yet. The vampire shock will wear off
in a second.

2051
02:28:44,019 --> 02:28:46,817
TALIESIN: Fun fact: There is no such thing as
vampire shock.

2052
02:28:46,817 --> 02:28:49,313
TRAVIS: And then all the humans in this bar will
be dead.

2053
02:28:49,313 --> 02:28:54,561
SAM: Do you need me to bite your finger to pour my
regenerative blood on it or anything?

2054
02:28:54,561 --> 02:28:55,927
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2055
02:28:55,927 --> 02:28:58,399
SAM: I will bite his finger.

2056
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:07,393
TALIESIN: Roll a strength plus two, since there's
no real--

2057
02:29:07,393 --> 02:29:11,015
LAURA and SAM: Critical success!

2058
02:29:11,015 --> 02:29:12,874
TALIESIN: Those are two blood criticals.

2059
02:29:12,874 --> 02:29:15,071
SAM: Two blood criticals and a fail.

2060
02:29:15,071 --> 02:29:23,863
TALIESIN: Okay. So this is called a messy
critical, so you bite his finger clean off.

2061
02:29:23,863 --> 02:29:26,673
TRAVIS: (laughs) What the fuck?

2062
02:29:26,673 --> 02:29:27,763
SAM: I'm sorry!

2063
02:29:27,763 --> 02:29:32,122
TRAVIS: (shouting) I just said bite it to fix it!
I'm a ninja turtle now!

2064
02:29:32,122 --> 02:29:34,686
SAM: I can heal it. I bite my wrist.

2065
02:29:34,686 --> 02:29:36,169
TALIESIN: You don't know how this works.

2066
02:29:36,169 --> 02:29:41,004
SAM: I saw True Blood! I bite my wrist and I rub
it on the stuff.

2067
02:29:41,004 --> 02:29:46,460
TALIESIN: Give me a strength plus two roll for
your wrist.

2068
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:50,664
SAM: One success, one fail.

2069
02:29:50,664 --> 02:29:53,825
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're just gnawing at yourself.
It's not going well.

2070
02:29:53,825 --> 02:29:58,892
SAM: You said plus two! Wait, what does that mean,
plus two? I roll two more dice?

2071
02:29:58,892 --> 02:30:00,268
TALIESIN: Yeah. Plus two more dice.

2072
02:30:00,268 --> 02:30:05,217
SAM: Oh, okay then. One success, one fail and
two more successes. Three successes.

2073
02:30:05,217 --> 02:30:10,919
TALIESIN: You have now managed to damage yourself.
Take a point of damage for gnawing through your wrist.

2074
02:30:10,919 --> 02:30:14,046
TRAVIS: What the hell, man?

2075
02:30:14,046 --> 02:30:19,547
TALIESIN: The bouncer is now coming back over and
he's coming. "What--"

2076
02:30:19,547 --> 02:30:26,648
TRAVIS: This guy-- not this gentleman. This guy that
just bolted for the bathrooms, he just pulled my

2077
02:30:26,753 --> 02:30:27,550
finger--

2078
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:30,311
TALIESIN: You are literally holding his finger
right now, I'm just pointing that out.

2079
02:30:30,311 --> 02:30:35,864
SAM: Listen man, we had some bad ecstasy and we're
just freaking out a little right now.

2080
02:30:35,864 --> 02:30:41,372
TRAVIS: Do you have a first aid kit? I'll get out
of your hair. I'll just need a first aid kit.

2081
02:30:41,372 --> 02:30:47,132
LAURA: Can I come down the stairs from above and
be like, what are you guys doing down here?

2082
02:30:47,132 --> 02:30:50,088
SAM: We were trying to do the finger trick.

2083
02:30:50,088 --> 02:30:51,630
TRAVIS: We were trying to get on the list.

2084
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:53,306
LAURA: These guys are with me.

2085
02:30:53,306 --> 02:31:03,222
TALIESIN: Wow. Roll a charisma persuasion. That's
so solid! Man, that's some Comic Con shit right

2086
02:31:03,222 --> 02:31:05,099
there! Fuck.

2087
02:31:05,099 --> 02:31:08,587
TRAVIS: A voice from above says--

2088
02:31:08,587 --> 02:31:11,776
LAURA: Two successes, one blood fail.

2089
02:31:11,776 --> 02:31:16,624
TALIESIN: Two successes, one blood fail? This guy
ain't that bright.

2090
02:31:16,624 --> 02:31:18,066
SAM: There's a lot of fails.

2091
02:31:18,066 --> 02:31:19,993
LAURA: Well yeah, but those don't count. It's only
blood fails that count.

2092
02:31:19,993 --> 02:31:22,013
SAM: Is that true?

2093
02:31:22,013 --> 02:31:32,766
TALIESIN: They're the ones that <i>really</i> count.
"This is more than I'm really up for. This is a

2094
02:31:32,766 --> 02:31:38,721
"lot." He's just going to shove. "I can't--"

2095
02:31:38,721 --> 02:31:43,380
SAM: Well, the old bite someone's finger off to
get in the VIP section trick.

2096
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:48,352
TALIESIN: You have traumatized this poor bouncer.
This was not a good night for him.

2097
02:31:48,352 --> 02:31:52,878
TRAVIS: Is the wound continuing to bleed or does
it--

2098
02:31:52,878 --> 02:31:54,934
SAM: Did my blood heal him at all?

2099
02:31:54,934 --> 02:32:01,069
TALIESIN: Do you want to think about making your
finger not be a problem anymore?

2100
02:32:01,069 --> 02:32:02,119
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2101
02:32:02,119 --> 02:32:04,147
TALIESIN: Are you going to try to meditate upon
that?

2102
02:32:04,147 --> 02:32:05,258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2103
02:32:05,258 --> 02:32:08,469
SAM: I'm going to try to put the finger back onto
the stump to see if seals.

2104
02:32:08,469 --> 02:32:11,276
LAURA: Hold it. Maybe it will coagulate or scab
over.

2105
02:32:11,276 --> 02:32:14,540
TALIESIN: Roll a hunger die.

2106
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:16,328
TRAVIS: Just one?

2107
02:32:16,328 --> 02:32:17,081
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2108
02:32:17,081 --> 02:32:18,699
LIAM: Losing one finger is not <i>the</i> worst.

2109
02:32:18,699 --> 02:32:21,703
TRAVIS: Four.

2110
02:32:21,703 --> 02:32:24,254
TALIESIN: Let me see. Hold on.

2111
02:32:24,254 --> 02:32:26,324
LAURA: Better than one.

2112
02:32:26,324 --> 02:32:33,288
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find all my stuff-- here
we are. Your finger does not grow back, but it

2113
02:32:33,288 --> 02:32:37,178
stops bleeding and crystallizes.

2114
02:32:37,178 --> 02:32:39,012
TRAVIS: What does my blood look like?

2115
02:32:39,012 --> 02:32:46,250
TALIESIN: It is a deep, dark crystalline red. It's
got a little bit of shimmer to it, not twilight

2116
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:48,208
sparkle! Motherfuckers.

2117
02:32:48,208 --> 02:32:50,786
TRAVIS: But that's actually the name of a show.

2118
02:32:50,786 --> 02:32:51,990
TALIESIN: Twilight Sparkle?

2119
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:54,110
SAM: It's a character from My Little Pony.

2120
02:32:54,110 --> 02:32:57,192
LIAM: Secret messages.

2121
02:32:57,192 --> 02:33:04,721
TALIESIN: Secret messages. It's the best. But it
almost seems to glow with a life of its own.

2122
02:33:04,721 --> 02:33:08,694
There's something about it that's a little
brighter. There's something about it that's a

2123
02:33:08,694 --> 02:33:10,001
little more--

2124
02:33:10,001 --> 02:33:13,180
TRAVIS: Brighter than the rest of these murdering
fucks?

2125
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:18,763
TALIESIN: It's part of your Aura Perception. Your
blood almost seems to have a life of its own.

2126
02:33:18,763 --> 02:33:21,810
There's something about it that's supernatural.

2127
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:24,400
SAM: I'm going to suck his severed finger like a
popsicle.

2128
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:27,734
TRAVIS: I am going to <i>resist</i>! Oh no, it's the
one you took!

2129
02:33:27,734 --> 02:33:30,743
SAM: Do I get anything out of it?

2130
02:33:30,743 --> 02:33:33,372
TALIESIN: Really, really awful fanart, but beyond
that--

2131
02:33:33,372 --> 02:33:35,202
SAM: (slurping)

2132
02:33:35,202 --> 02:33:37,452
(groaning)

2133
02:33:37,452 --> 02:33:39,565
TALIESIN: The best. The best fanart.

2134
02:33:39,565 --> 02:33:40,828
TRAVIS: Always you.

2135
02:33:40,828 --> 02:33:42,575
LAURA: Stop sucking on my husband's finger!

2136
02:33:42,575 --> 02:33:45,208
TALIESIN: This is not the worst thing I've seen in
a vampire game.

2137
02:33:45,208 --> 02:33:50,414
LIAM: I'm sure. I guess I'll show up at the bottom
of the stairs now, too. I wasn't there for that.

2138
02:33:50,414 --> 02:33:54,145
Laura! I feel like you're really unsafe up there
without me.

2139
02:33:54,145 --> 02:33:55,928
LAURA: Did you see us go up?

2140
02:33:55,928 --> 02:33:59,871
LIAM: Yes, I did as I was crossing through.
Absolutely. I saw the altercation.

2141
02:33:59,871 --> 02:34:03,041
LAURA: I come back down. He's the last one, 
I swear.

2142
02:34:03,041 --> 02:34:05,229
TALIESIN: Let me check. (scoffs)

2143
02:34:05,229 --> 02:34:07,228
LAURA: Come on.

2144
02:34:07,228 --> 02:34:10,629
LIAM: Love you! Thanks.

2145
02:34:10,629 --> 02:34:13,905
TALIESIN: Are you going to try and heal your wrist
too, as well?

2146
02:34:13,957 --> 02:34:15,422
SAM: Do I do that?

2147
02:34:15,475 --> 02:34:16,358
TALIESIN: You can try.

2148
02:34:16,358 --> 02:34:17,819
SAM: Do I get any blood out of the finger?

2149
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:23,591
TALIESIN: It's weird, man. It tastes weird. It's
making you feel weird. It's like Dodger Dog weird.

2150
02:34:23,591 --> 02:34:25,747
That's probably for the best.

2151
02:34:25,747 --> 02:34:27,778
LAURA: In Interview with a Vampire, it's bad to
feed on other vampires.

2152
02:34:27,778 --> 02:34:30,916
SAM: Oh, I didn't know. I haven't seen that! I
haven't seen that, because that's the one with Tom Cruise.

2153
02:34:30,916 --> 02:34:33,652
LAURA: Right? It's bad to feed on other vampires.

2154
02:34:33,652 --> 02:34:35,866
LIAM: I mean, are we supposed to be referencing
films for this?

2155
02:34:35,866 --> 02:34:38,316
TALIESIN: That's pretty much what you have to go
on right now.

2156
02:34:38,316 --> 02:34:39,888
TRAVIS: It's dead blood, yeah.

2157
02:34:39,888 --> 02:34:43,640
SAM: If my wrist hurts, I'll think about it.
Sure.

2158
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:47,618
LAURA: But in the book series I read, vampires fed
on other vampires and it was totally chill.

2159
02:34:47,618 --> 02:34:49,017
LIAM: Book series?

2160
02:34:49,017 --> 02:34:50,846
TALIESIN: Roll a d10.

2161
02:34:50,846 --> 02:34:52,001
SAM: Two.

2162
02:34:52,001 --> 02:34:58,390
TALIESIN: You gain a hunger, but your wrist
seems to-- you've got them. That's fine.

2163
02:34:58,390 --> 02:35:02,326
Rob me of all my joy. I will remember this.

2164
02:35:02,326 --> 02:35:04,911
SAM: And then what? I heal?

2165
02:35:04,911 --> 02:35:06,767
TALIESIN: You're healed for that.

2166
02:35:06,767 --> 02:35:08,580
SAM: So I get my health point back?

2167
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:13,058
TRAVIS: So we make our way to the top of the
stairs. What do we see?

2168
02:35:13,058 --> 02:35:18,203
TALIESIN: This is where the <i>real</i> club is. It's a
completely different DJ, it's a completely

2169
02:35:18,203 --> 02:35:24,226
different crowd. Except of course, that being a
goth industrial club, it could've been the same DJ

2170
02:35:24,226 --> 02:35:28,765
and the exact same crowd and no one would ever
notice. It's still a bunch of people dressed in black.

2171
02:35:28,765 --> 02:35:31,456
LIAM: The music doesn't really change too
much.

2172
02:35:31,515 --> 02:35:33,222
TALIESIN: No, it's just a different track of the
same vibe.

2173
02:35:33,222 --> 02:35:34,576
LIAM: Got it.

2174
02:35:34,576 --> 02:35:37,091
LAURA: Does it feel like Blade? Like, are people
dressed super-cool?

2175
02:35:37,091 --> 02:35:42,055
TALIESIN: Yes, actually. There's a lot of black
leather; there's a lot of black vinyl. People have

2176
02:35:42,055 --> 02:35:46,720
obviously dressed up and done nice makeup. You
can't tell if necessarily everybody is wearing

2177
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:50,580
the nice makeup, but it's definitely-- these are
some pretty people who have gone out of their way

2178
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:52,229
to be extra pretty tonight.

2179
02:35:52,229 --> 02:35:53,777
LIAM: Who's on the fringes that stands out?

2180
02:35:53,777 --> 02:36:00,408
TALIESIN: This is a <i>large</i> dance floor with a
main stage for the DJ.

2181
02:36:00,408 --> 02:36:06,026
SAM: Taliesin, the music. Are we talking things
that I would recognize? Chemical Brothers, your

2182
02:36:06,026 --> 02:36:07,609
Fat Boy Slims?

2183
02:36:07,609 --> 02:36:09,739
TRAVIS: Fat Boy Slim.

2184
02:36:09,739 --> 02:36:17,052
TALIESIN: You're such a gift. Ugh. Nothing. No.

2185
02:36:17,052 --> 02:36:23,241
LAURA: Are there any tables in the corner?
Anywhere where it looks like important people

2186
02:36:23,241 --> 02:36:24,454
would be sitting?

2187
02:36:24,454 --> 02:36:31,371
TALIESIN: There are some little corner tables all
around the outskirts. There's obviously a couple

2188
02:36:31,371 --> 02:36:35,776
dance boxes. But there are corner tables all around
the outskirts, but they all seem roped off and

2189
02:36:35,776 --> 02:36:40,180
there are definitely people sitting there who seem
like they have these tables on reserve.

2190
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:42,825
TRAVIS: Are there any golden thrones?

2191
02:36:42,825 --> 02:36:47,936
TALIESIN: No golden thrones. Just wumpa wumpa
music, a couple go-go boxes, a--

2192
02:36:47,936 --> 02:36:49,106
TRAVIS: A bar?

2193
02:36:49,106 --> 02:36:53,587
TALIESIN: There is a bar. There is a very nice
bar. Three sides, two bartenders.

2194
02:36:53,587 --> 02:37:01,868
SAM: I want to go on the dance floor and see if I
can chat anybody up. Excuse me.

2195
02:37:01,868 --> 02:37:05,209
TALIESIN: Are you really just doing the
Chattanooga Choo Choo? I really hope you are.

2196
02:37:05,209 --> 02:37:08,541
SAM: With a white man's overbite.

2197
02:37:08,541 --> 02:37:14,744
TALIESIN: All right. Are you going to try and chat
up a guy or a girl?

2198
02:37:14,744 --> 02:37:22,885
SAM: A female. Using my vampiric charms, I'm going
to say: Hey! Where is he tonight?

2199
02:37:22,885 --> 02:37:26,681
TALIESIN: Where... is he?

2200
02:37:26,681 --> 02:37:28,776
SAM: Where is <i>he</i> tonight?

2201
02:37:28,776 --> 02:37:31,559
TALIESIN: Where is he tonight?

2202
02:37:31,559 --> 02:37:33,459
SAM: Yeah, the big man. You know.

2203
02:37:33,459 --> 02:37:43,112
TALIESIN: The girl who has her back towards you,
who was ignoring you, turns around, and Satine

2204
02:37:43,112 --> 02:37:47,645
looks you in the face and says, "What the fuck are
you talking about?"

2205
02:37:47,645 --> 02:37:49,141
SAM: Oh hey!

2206
02:37:49,141 --> 02:37:50,152
TALIESIN: "Hey Sam!"

2207
02:37:50,152 --> 02:38:00,157
SAM: Hey! You know, the guy who runs the show. The
guy who runs the club, the most important of us here.

2208
02:38:00,157 --> 02:38:03,512
TALIESIN: "Did you-- is <i>that</i> what's been going
on?"

2209
02:38:03,512 --> 02:38:04,890
SAM: Yeah.

2210
02:38:04,890 --> 02:38:06,114
TALIESIN: "So you're all--"

2211
02:38:06,114 --> 02:38:08,849
SAM: Yeah, that's how it is.

2212
02:38:08,849 --> 02:38:10,596
TALIESIN: "All right. That's cool."

2213
02:38:10,596 --> 02:38:11,643
SAM: Is it?

2214
02:38:11,643 --> 02:38:12,811
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

2215
02:38:12,811 --> 02:38:14,303
SAM: Have you always been like this?

2216
02:38:14,303 --> 02:38:17,595
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Why?"

2217
02:38:17,595 --> 02:38:18,860
SAM: <i>Always</i> always?

2218
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:26,682
TALIESIN: "There are no-- we come in and shoot at
night, man. Have you not been paying attention

2219
02:38:26,682 --> 02:38:27,654
"this whole time?"

2220
02:38:27,654 --> 02:38:29,164
SAM: I don't know most of the crew.

2221
02:38:29,164 --> 02:38:31,128
TALIESIN: "You are really oblivious. It's like--"

2222
02:38:31,128 --> 02:38:33,178
LIAM: Hey. We're a little--

2223
02:38:33,178 --> 02:38:34,112
TALIESIN: "Hey."

2224
02:38:34,112 --> 02:38:35,108
LIAM: And hey, yeah.

2225
02:38:35,108 --> 02:38:37,167
TALIESIN: "Yeah, no, you're-- wow, you got the
whole thing going on."

2226
02:38:37,167 --> 02:38:39,098
LIAM: Yeah. We're unlikely, I know.

2227
02:38:39,098 --> 02:38:41,625
TALIESIN: "Wow. This has been a rough week,
then. Okay!"

2228
02:38:41,625 --> 02:38:43,270
LIAM: It's pretty good though.

2229
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:44,999
TALIESIN: "No, you look like you're doing okay."

2230
02:38:44,999 --> 02:38:46,029
LIAM: Then join me.

2231
02:38:46,029 --> 02:38:47,332
TALIESIN and LAURA: Hey!

2232
02:38:47,332 --> 02:38:49,761
TALIESIN: "What happened?"

2233
02:38:49,761 --> 02:38:52,727
LIAM: Yeah, that happened.

2234
02:38:52,727 --> 02:38:54,137
TRAVIS: My dark gift.

2235
02:38:54,137 --> 02:39:00,994
TALIESIN: "This is a once-a-week thing, it's very
exclusive. I'm amazed, even with this that you

2236
02:39:00,994 --> 02:39:03,916
"guys got-- This is a very serious thing, like this
is-- this place."

2237
02:39:03,916 --> 02:39:08,102
LAURA: Satine, can you help us?

2238
02:39:08,165 --> 02:39:11,338
TALIESIN: "Yeah. What do you need? You want a
drink? You need anything?"

2239
02:39:11,338 --> 02:39:15,476
LAURA: Well, do you know what happened there? Do
you know what happened up at the studio?

2240
02:39:15,476 --> 02:39:22,189
TALIESIN: "I mean, TwitchCon was this week. I've
been really busy. I've got a whole--"

2241
02:39:22,189 --> 02:39:29,574
LAURA: It's fucking crazy. It went crazy. Like,
the server room is a giant meatball.

2242
02:39:29,574 --> 02:39:31,558
Everybody's--

2243
02:39:31,558 --> 02:39:33,184
SAM: Matt and Marisha are dead.

2244
02:39:33,184 --> 02:39:34,899
TALIESIN: "Like dead?"

2245
02:39:34,899 --> 02:39:37,203
TRAVIS: No. Like ashes and mushrooms.

2246
02:39:37,203 --> 02:39:41,620
LAURA: Like, nobody told us what was going on. We
just woke up in coffins.

2247
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:45,108
TALIESIN: "Holy shit. Okay. Hold on--"

2248
02:39:45,108 --> 02:39:46,704
LIAM: Is that how it normally goes down?

2249
02:39:46,704 --> 02:39:51,697
TALIESIN: "Nah, this is weird. Normally, there's a
lot of talk about-- Okay, I'm going to talk to a

2250
02:39:51,697 --> 02:39:54,819
"few people. You guys-- hmm."

2251
02:39:54,819 --> 02:39:58,443
TRAVIS: Before you go, have you seen Taliesin?
He's the only one we haven't seen.

2252
02:39:58,443 --> 02:40:02,882
TALIESIN: "Oh god. You know, I've been asking him
to come out to this club for ages and he just

2253
02:40:02,882 --> 02:40:03,884
"never comes out."

2254
02:40:03,884 --> 02:40:05,611
LAURA: Is he like us?

2255
02:40:05,611 --> 02:40:14,734
TALIESIN: "I mean, not that I'm aware of... He's
his own thing. That's just a whole thing, but

2256
02:40:14,734 --> 02:40:16,311
"you know."

2257
02:40:16,311 --> 02:40:18,318
SAM: Is he here tonight? Have you seen him?

2258
02:40:18,318 --> 02:40:20,413
TALIESIN: "As far as I know, he's never been
here."

2259
02:40:20,413 --> 02:40:22,889
SAM: Who runs this club? Whose club is this?

2260
02:40:22,889 --> 02:40:28,509
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's a complicated story we'll
get into. That's complicated, but it's good that

2261
02:40:28,509 --> 02:40:34,680
"you're here. We're going to work this out. Why
don't you guys just don't ruffle any feathers? Go

2262
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:35,900
"have a drink."

2263
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:38,487
TRAVIS: Any recommendations from the bar?

2264
02:40:38,487 --> 02:40:40,160
TALIESIN: "Have a cocktail."

2265
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:41,469
LIAM: Special menu?

2266
02:40:41,469 --> 02:40:44,381
TALIESIN: "The whole menu's special. It'll
be good."

2267
02:40:44,381 --> 02:40:45,933
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I head towards the bar.

2268
02:40:45,933 --> 02:40:48,095
LAURA: We were buried with no money. Does that
matter?

2269
02:40:48,095 --> 02:40:49,438
TALIESIN: "No. You're fine."

2270
02:40:49,438 --> 02:40:50,888
LAURA: Is this like a mushroom--

2271
02:40:50,888 --> 02:40:52,212
TALIESIN: "You got a Twitch show! You're great!"

2272
02:40:52,212 --> 02:40:58,428
SAM: Do you think they have any Ace of Base
records that we could request?

2273
02:40:58,428 --> 02:41:00,223
TRAVIS: I saw the sign...

2274
02:41:00,223 --> 02:41:04,649
TRAVIS and LAURA: (singing)

2275
02:41:04,649 --> 02:41:09,638
TALIESIN: (laughs) "Thankfully, this is a club that
caters to people whose tastes haven't changed in

2276
02:41:09,638 --> 02:41:18,975
"decades, so you're going to be-- You're going to
fit in, but no. No Ace of Base. I'll be right back."

2277
02:41:18,975 --> 02:41:20,209
TRAVIS: We go to the bar.

2278
02:41:20,209 --> 02:41:23,343
LAURA: Maybe we can get rid of some of this hunger.
Help us.

2279
02:41:23,343 --> 02:41:33,727
TRAVIS: Okay. Barkeep! Would you thrill us with
four glasses of whatever you would like tonight?

2280
02:41:33,727 --> 02:41:35,534
LAURA: Something red.

2281
02:41:35,534 --> 02:41:36,990
TRAVIS: Dealer's choice.

2282
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:41,325
SAM: Blood. We would like to drink human blood. We
need human blood to drink.

2283
02:41:41,325 --> 02:41:43,131
TALIESIN: "I got just the thing. Hold on."

2284
02:41:43,131 --> 02:41:44,348
LIAM: Oh man, that's so gauche.

2285
02:41:44,348 --> 02:41:49,747
TALIESIN: He goes and there is literally a tap
that gets pulled and a red foamy lager.

2286
02:41:49,747 --> 02:41:53,615
TRAVIS: Does somebody scream when it gets pulled?
(yelling)

2287
02:41:53,675 --> 02:42:07,881
TALIESIN: Pulls four weird foamy beers that
are definitely-- St. Valentine's Day Specials, is what

2288
02:42:07,881 --> 02:42:08,692
I'll say.

2289
02:42:08,692 --> 02:42:11,625
TRAVIS: Do they smell Irish? European?

2290
02:42:11,625 --> 02:42:15,059
TALIESIN: They smell, if I had to place it--

2291
02:42:15,059 --> 02:42:17,190
TRAVIS: Has a nose of--?

2292
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:24,375
TALIESIN: It's the best, it's tomato juice and
vodka and just a little something special, a

2293
02:42:24,375 --> 02:42:26,414
little bit of Worcestershire. It's got a little
bit of that.

2294
02:42:26,414 --> 02:42:27,721
LAURA: Drink it up!

2295
02:42:27,721 --> 02:42:32,672
TRAVIS: A toast. I feel we're finally in a sort of
safe place.

2296
02:42:32,672 --> 02:42:35,092
LIAM: Yeah, we're civilized.

2297
02:42:35,092 --> 02:42:37,371
TRAVIS: To the new world order, right?

2298
02:42:37,371 --> 02:42:38,373
LIAM: Yes.

2299
02:42:38,373 --> 02:42:39,980
TRAVIS: To our fallen--

2300
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:41,074
LAURA: Homies.

2301
02:42:41,074 --> 02:42:46,434
TRAVIS: Yeah. May they live forever as dust
and spore.

2302
02:42:46,434 --> 02:42:50,958
SAM: And to the confidence that we all have, having
killed a human being.

2303
02:42:50,958 --> 02:42:53,467
LIAM: Fucking A.

2304
02:42:53,467 --> 02:42:56,449
SAM: True vampires.

2305
02:42:56,449 --> 02:42:59,933
LAURA: True vampires! Just kidding, baby.

2306
02:42:59,933 --> 02:43:03,326
TRAVIS: Drink up! To rats.

2307
02:43:03,326 --> 02:43:05,930
SAM: First kill, man. It just felt so good.

2308
02:43:05,930 --> 02:43:09,664
LAURA: If it had been somebody we didn't know.
It's just because it was Mike!

2309
02:43:09,664 --> 02:43:14,061
TRAVIS: You're sleeping in your own coffin
tonight.

2310
02:43:14,061 --> 02:43:16,649
SAM: You don't have a double wide.

2311
02:43:16,649 --> 02:43:19,596
TRAVIS and LAURA: California king!

2312
02:43:19,596 --> 02:43:26,011
TALIESIN: Wow. I'd never even thought about that and
now it's going to be the only thing I think about

2313
02:43:26,011 --> 02:43:30,600
for the rest of the night. What's a California
King coffin look like?

2314
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,811
LAURA: Comfy.

2315
02:43:31,811 --> 02:43:34,108
TALIESIN: Very comfortable. They're not comfy.

2316
02:43:34,108 --> 02:43:37,643
LIAM: What would the Briarwoods do? Like a side
car?

2317
02:43:37,643 --> 02:43:44,419
TRAVIS: As we sip these drinks and we turn our backs 
to the bar, posting up like one does,

2318
02:43:44,419 --> 02:43:51,559
can I see with my Heightened Senses anyone 
giving us a look of malcontent?

2319
02:43:51,559 --> 02:44:02,623
TALIESIN: A look of malcontent? There's a mix of
faces in the crowd. There's definitely some

2320
02:44:02,623 --> 02:44:10,118
indifference, there's some people who are eyeing
you very suspiciously, and a few smiling faces who

2321
02:44:10,118 --> 02:44:11,811
seem delighted.

2322
02:44:11,811 --> 02:44:16,653
TRAVIS: Before I look at the smiling faces, do I
get any whiff of a giant dog in the crowd?

2323
02:44:16,653 --> 02:44:20,083
TALIESIN: That would require a blood roll.

2324
02:44:20,083 --> 02:44:21,595
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

2325
02:44:21,595 --> 02:44:25,260
LAURA: Do we get rid of one of our blood dice from
this lager?

2326
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:28,084
TRAVIS: Perception and investigation. Jesus--

2327
02:44:28,084 --> 02:44:30,788
TALIESIN: Yeah, I love the toss.

2328
02:44:30,788 --> 02:44:33,527
TRAVIS: I'll use the Heightened Senses aspect.

2329
02:44:33,527 --> 02:44:40,053
TALIESIN: You also lose a blood die because of--
if you have one, you have to be at one at all times.

2330
02:44:40,053 --> 02:44:42,908
TRAVIS: Two successes.

2331
02:44:42,908 --> 02:44:49,991
TALIESIN: Two successes? Yeah, something smells a
little doggish. There's a little wolf, but it's

2332
02:44:49,991 --> 02:44:52,946
not what you had last time. It's something else.

2333
02:44:52,946 --> 02:44:57,783
TRAVIS: Can I focus on the smiling faces and see
what we see?

2334
02:44:57,783 --> 02:45:03,148
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's definitely a bouncing,
bobbing Erika Ishii who's jumping around the

2335
02:45:03,148 --> 02:45:05,940
crowd, having a good time and she just seems happy
that's--

2336
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:09,407
TRAVIS: Laura? Erika Ishii's here.

2337
02:45:09,407 --> 02:45:11,742
LAURA: (squealing) I run over and start dancing
with Erika.

2338
02:45:11,742 --> 02:45:13,811
TALIESIN: As she sees you, (squealing).

2339
02:45:13,811 --> 02:45:16,694
LAURA: Are you a vampire?

2340
02:45:16,694 --> 02:45:17,869
TALIESIN: "What? I mean, yeah!"

2341
02:45:17,869 --> 02:45:18,783
LAURA: Oh my god!

2342
02:45:18,783 --> 02:45:19,606
TALIESIN: "Oh my god!"

2343
02:45:19,606 --> 02:45:20,535
LAURA: How long have you been a vampire?

2344
02:45:20,535 --> 02:45:21,352
TALIESIN: "Oh, ages!"

2345
02:45:21,352 --> 02:45:22,410
LAURA: Really?

2346
02:45:22,410 --> 02:45:23,191
TALIESIN: "Yeah!"

2347
02:45:23,191 --> 02:45:24,698
LAURA: Oh, that would make so much sense.

2348
02:45:24,698 --> 02:45:26,328
TALIESIN: "Doesn't it? Sunscreen. It's a trick."

2349
02:45:26,328 --> 02:45:27,609
TRAVIS: Her hair's so cool.

2350
02:45:27,609 --> 02:45:31,477
TALIESIN: No, it's why she has such great hair.
It's the undead. Hair of the undead. It's the

2351
02:45:31,477 --> 02:45:32,809
haircut that did it.

2352
02:45:32,809 --> 02:45:34,380
LIAM: Is all the energy vampiric?

2353
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:40,417
TALIESIN: All the energy seems to be-- oh yeah.
From her? I mean, that makes sense, doesn't it?

2354
02:45:40,417 --> 02:45:43,411
LIAM: Does it? Because I want some of that.

2355
02:45:43,411 --> 02:45:47,984
TALIESIN: That's a different vibe than you've got,
sadly. You've got a different vibe going on.

2356
02:45:47,984 --> 02:45:49,229
LIAM: Okay.

2357
02:45:49,229 --> 02:45:52,462
LAURA: Erika?

2358
02:45:52,462 --> 02:45:54,073
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Yeah! Hey!"

2359
02:45:54,073 --> 02:45:56,959
LAURA: Where are the people that run this place?

2360
02:45:56,959 --> 02:45:58,174
TALIESIN: "What?"

2361
02:45:58,174 --> 02:45:59,576
LAURA: Where are the people that run this place?

2362
02:45:59,576 --> 02:46:00,798
TALIESIN: "Well, I mean, they're here!"

2363
02:46:00,798 --> 02:46:03,888
LAURA: How do we find them? How do we know what's
going on?

2364
02:46:03,888 --> 02:46:07,525
TALIESIN: "I don't know! What's going on is just a
party! It's great! Yeah!"

2365
02:46:07,525 --> 02:46:09,220
LAURA: It's great.

2366
02:46:09,220 --> 02:46:10,230
TALIESIN: "It's so great!"

2367
02:46:10,230 --> 02:46:11,321
LAURA: This is a lot for me.

2368
02:46:11,321 --> 02:46:21,504
TALIESIN: (shouting) "I'll be right back!" She
bounces out. There's a few minutes of sitting,

2369
02:46:21,504 --> 02:46:26,640
watching this crowd. There's definitely, slowly
starting to become more concerned faces checking

2370
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:28,335
you out.

2371
02:46:28,335 --> 02:46:29,939
SAM: Checking <i>us</i> out?

2372
02:46:29,939 --> 02:46:31,082
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2373
02:46:31,082 --> 02:46:32,258
TRAVIS: None that we recognize, though?

2374
02:46:32,258 --> 02:46:39,741
TALIESIN: Well, give me a perception awareness,
just for fun. Just see if you maybe know any of

2375
02:46:39,741 --> 02:46:40,954
these people.

2376
02:46:40,954 --> 02:46:45,693
LIAM: I'm still riding high on Friedle. I start
dancing.

2377
02:46:45,693 --> 02:46:47,489
TRAVIS: A critical. Two tens.

2378
02:46:47,489 --> 02:46:57,676
TALIESIN: Critical success? Yeah, there's a few
people that you're starting to recognize, but not

2379
02:46:57,676 --> 02:46:59,872
people you know personally, but there's
definitely--

2380
02:46:59,872 --> 02:47:01,213
LAURA: Celebrities?

2381
02:47:01,213 --> 02:47:07,510
TALIESIN: There's a few people who have a TV deal
in here. There's a couple serious TV deals in

2382
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:14,241
here. There's definitely a couple familiar faces
rounding around. Nobody that you're close to, but

2383
02:47:14,241 --> 02:47:15,800
there's a--

2384
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:17,596
TRAVIS: This is a happening spot.

2385
02:47:17,596 --> 02:47:23,312
TALIESIN: Few ironic faces. Juliet Landau wanders
through for a second and just nods and walks by.

2386
02:47:23,312 --> 02:47:34,805
They're nodding and obviously talking about
something and after a while, somebody comes up and

2387
02:47:34,805 --> 02:47:39,642
talks to Erika for a second in the corner and she
comes bounding over. "They want to talk to you guys."

2388
02:47:39,642 --> 02:47:43,107
LAURA: Okay. Should we be nervous?

2389
02:47:43,107 --> 02:47:49,019
TALIESIN: "No. I'm sure it's fine. You just got to
be cool. You guys are cool."

2390
02:47:49,019 --> 02:47:50,598
SAM: We're so cool.

2391
02:47:50,598 --> 02:47:53,093
TRAVIS: Yeah, look at Sam. We're totally cool.

2392
02:47:53,093 --> 02:48:06,310
TALIESIN: "You guys are cool, yeah. It's fine."
And you're taken to a far corner table, the

2393
02:48:06,310 --> 02:48:12,833
furthest, deepest corner so that you have the
best-- it's the furthest away from the speakers.

2394
02:48:12,833 --> 02:48:21,914
It's really nice. You can actually talk like
humans. And there, very gently spinning a very

2395
02:48:21,914 --> 02:48:27,863
nice cocktail, is a mildly irritated-looking Yuri
Lowenthal.

2396
02:48:27,863 --> 02:48:32,585
LAURA: Oh my god, this makes so much sense!

2397
02:48:32,585 --> 02:48:34,458
TALIESIN: It makes so much sense, doesn't it?

2398
02:48:34,458 --> 02:48:36,517
TRAVIS: He speaks nine languages.

2399
02:48:36,517 --> 02:48:38,606
LAURA: Like, he's a ninja, for real.

2400
02:48:38,693 --> 02:48:43,693
TALIESIN: Why they never age. The two of them just
don't age, do they? He's just peppering with fake

2401
02:48:43,693 --> 02:48:47,162
color in the hair, that's all it is.

2402
02:48:47,294 --> 02:48:48,321
SAM: It's Yuri!

2403
02:48:48,321 --> 02:48:49,867
LAURA: What's up, man?

2404
02:48:49,867 --> 02:48:59,611
TALIESIN: "Hey. I mean, this is weird, guys. So
what happened? Like honestly, we don't know. No one--"

2405
02:48:59,611 --> 02:49:06,531
SAM: Long story short, Geek & Sundry, Legendary,
there's armageddon over there. Monsters roving--

2406
02:49:06,531 --> 02:49:08,713
TALIESIN: "Well, there was a fire, it's all--"

2407
02:49:08,713 --> 02:49:10,097
TRAVIS: It was an explosion.

2408
02:49:10,097 --> 02:49:11,220
SAM: We set it off.

2409
02:49:11,220 --> 02:49:14,350
LAURA: We didn't <i>set it off</i>, it went off around
us.

2410
02:49:14,350 --> 02:49:17,578
TRAVIS: You remember Matthew Colville, right?

2411
02:49:17,578 --> 02:49:18,826
TALIESIN: "Oh, of course."

2412
02:49:18,826 --> 02:49:25,041
TRAVIS: Yeah, we woke up in coffins, missing
Taliesin. Matt and Marisha were killed while we

2413
02:49:25,041 --> 02:49:27,373
were trying to figure out what was actually going
on.

2414
02:49:27,373 --> 02:49:31,364
TALIESIN: "Well, we'll get to Taliesin. So
Colville did this? Was this his doing?"

2415
02:49:31,364 --> 02:49:34,302
LAURA: No, I don't think it was Matt that did it.
I think--

2416
02:49:34,302 --> 02:49:36,181
LIAM: It all sums back to Gary Gygax.

2417
02:49:36,181 --> 02:49:39,454
TALIESIN: "Wait. Gygax did this?"

2418
02:49:39,454 --> 02:49:40,982
LAURA, TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah.

2419
02:49:40,982 --> 02:49:46,561
SAM: We don't know if he did it, but he was
involved and there's been a changing of the guard

2420
02:49:46,561 --> 02:49:50,266
or disturbance in the order of things. The lizard
people are very upset.

2421
02:49:50,266 --> 02:49:53,807
LAURA: Yeah. They said that people go down in
their tunnels. They're super pissed.

2422
02:49:53,807 --> 02:49:57,809
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I was supposed to give you-- I
didn't think it would be you, but I'm supposed to

2423
02:49:57,809 --> 02:50:03,886
say they're very displeased and that we need to
make amends. We've got to find a way back to our

2424
02:50:03,886 --> 02:50:06,048
friendship. You guys are supposed to offer a boon--

2425
02:50:06,048 --> 02:50:08,016
SAM: Who said that? That was--

2426
02:50:08,016 --> 02:50:11,476
TRAVIS: Mahlo, or it was Lockey?

2427
02:50:11,476 --> 02:50:13,598
LAURA: No, it was the head of the lizard guys.

2428
02:50:13,598 --> 02:50:18,795
TALIESIN: "So this is all Gygax? Or was this
Colville and Gygax working together?"

2429
02:50:18,795 --> 02:50:25,890
LAURA: So Gygax said he wanted to play with Matt
Mercer, but then Mercer got killed by the sun and so--

2430
02:50:25,890 --> 02:50:27,619
TALIESIN: "Why does that guy got to be so weird,
man?"

2431
02:50:27,619 --> 02:50:29,294
TRAVIS: I didn't even know he was alive.

2432
02:50:29,294 --> 02:50:33,370
LIAM: Yuri, I'm so sorry. I've got questions.

2433
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:34,356
TALIESIN: "Sure."

2434
02:50:34,356 --> 02:50:40,507
LIAM: When I met you in '99, 2000, were you
<i>already</i>? In Princeton, New Jersey?

2435
02:50:40,507 --> 02:50:41,684
TALIESIN: "Oh, no."

2436
02:50:41,684 --> 02:50:43,382
LIAM: So this is somewhere between--

2437
02:50:43,382 --> 02:50:48,837
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, this wasn't part of the plan
for a while. I've been working towards this, so yeah,

2438
02:50:48,837 --> 02:50:50,398
"this has been a goal for a while."

2439
02:50:50,398 --> 02:50:51,567
TRAVIS: And Tara, too?

2440
02:50:51,567 --> 02:50:52,795
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, of course."

2441
02:50:52,795 --> 02:50:58,600
LIAM: And what about-- offspring is like Alucard?
Like halfsies?

2442
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:02,248
TALIESIN: "Oh no, we're raising him just
perfectly. We're trying to do it right, raising

2443
02:51:02,248 --> 02:51:06,160
"him normally, letting him find himself. It's going
to be a while before we--"

2444
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:08,876
LAURA: So how long does it take to actually
turn?

2445
02:51:08,876 --> 02:51:12,888
TALIESIN: "Oh, it takes about a week and there's a
whole ritual that's involved and usually a

2446
02:51:12,888 --> 02:51:17,810
"becoming, usually somebody-- well, you're supposed
to have somebody--"

2447
02:51:17,810 --> 02:51:19,558
LAURA: Nobody walked us through it!

2448
02:51:19,558 --> 02:51:21,368
TALIESIN: "Yeah. This is a problem. There is--"

2449
02:51:21,368 --> 02:51:23,865
TRAVIS: Rats, man. We ate rats.

2450
02:51:23,865 --> 02:51:26,962
LAURA: Is that bad? I didn't mind.

2451
02:51:26,962 --> 02:51:28,526
LIAM: Some of us ate rats.

2452
02:51:28,526 --> 02:51:35,149
TALIESIN: "Normally there's a process for this and
this is a problem. You're supposed to have a

2453
02:51:35,149 --> 02:51:37,827
"sponsor. Let's put it this way."

2454
02:51:37,827 --> 02:51:39,094
SAM: Like Tor Books?

2455
02:51:39,094 --> 02:51:45,948
TALIESIN: "Like Tor Books." Tor Books. "You're
supposed to have a sponsor and really, this is

2456
02:51:45,948 --> 02:51:53,132
"tricky because there's a process to just make sure
you don't go around killing people and making a

2457
02:51:53,132 --> 02:52:00,365
"scene in these things and there's really-- and you
guys haven't done anything inappropriate yet, have you?"

2458
02:52:00,365 --> 02:52:03,232
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you haven't done anything
inappropriate.

2459
02:52:03,246 --> 02:52:04,790
SAM: Well, I didn't kill any innocent people.

2460
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:10,480
LAURA: I mean, the only person that I killed
got burned up in the fire when everything-- so it

2461
02:52:10,480 --> 02:52:13,392
wasn't like we left any evidence, you know?

2462
02:52:13,392 --> 02:52:14,390
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Wow."

2463
02:52:14,390 --> 02:52:16,411
SAM: No bodies around in public places.

2464
02:52:16,411 --> 02:52:17,490
LAURA: Yeah. Nowhere in public.

2465
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:18,610
LIAM: I'm clean as a whistle.

2466
02:52:18,610 --> 02:52:21,270
TRAVIS: And as far as monsters go, thank god we
know you, right? Seems like you're pretty high up

2467
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:22,335
right now.

2468
02:52:22,335 --> 02:52:27,847
TALIESIN: "Yeah, I mean, I'm not that high up,
though. I'm really here because they thought that

2469
02:52:27,847 --> 02:52:35,761
"you should have a familiar face. And there's a
bunch of us here who're in it for you guys, but

2470
02:52:35,761 --> 02:52:41,398
"there's a lot of conversation about what to do
with the four of you. We don't even know what

2471
02:52:41,398 --> 02:52:44,071
"family you belong to. This is all so
complicated."

2472
02:52:44,071 --> 02:52:46,032
SAM: Are families assigned to us?

2473
02:52:46,032 --> 02:52:47,854
TALIESIN: "You see, this is the problem."

2474
02:52:47,854 --> 02:52:50,680
TRAVIS: Like a foster situation or--

2475
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:53,270
TALIESIN: (sighs) "This is where things get so
complicated."

2476
02:52:53,270 --> 02:52:56,537
LIAM: We are ready to learn. Spill it, girl. Spill
it.

2477
02:52:56,620 --> 02:53:08,208
TALIESIN: "Well, (sighs). We've been giving this a
lot of thought, and--"

2478
02:53:08,208 --> 02:53:12,585
LAURA: Are you adopting us?

2479
02:53:12,585 --> 02:53:16,566
TALIESIN: "I wish I could. I'm not-- I just don't
really have that kind of--"

2480
02:53:16,566 --> 02:53:18,053
SAM: Are you going to kill us?

2481
02:53:18,053 --> 02:53:25,067
TALIESIN: "No, I'm not going to do that. But that
has come up as an option."

2482
02:53:25,067 --> 02:53:26,389
LAURA: Oh no!

2483
02:53:26,389 --> 02:53:28,808
TRAVIS: Sure would love to avoid that.

2484
02:53:28,808 --> 02:53:31,344
SAM: We could prove ourselves in a
crucible-style--

2485
02:53:31,344 --> 02:53:35,250
LAURA: Yeah, we can get sorted! Give us a family!

2486
02:53:35,250 --> 02:53:39,083
LIAM: We're getting ahead of ourselves. Yuri,
what's the deal?

2487
02:53:39,083 --> 02:53:44,888
TALIESIN: "Well, you're going to need some kind of
sponsor or we're going to have to deal with you."

2488
02:53:44,888 --> 02:53:46,479
LAURA: How do we get a sponsor?

2489
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:48,039
LIAM: Yeah, what do we do?

2490
02:53:48,039 --> 02:53:54,286
TALIESIN: "I don't know. I guess I'll see if there's
anybody around who's up to dealing with this and

2491
02:53:54,286 --> 02:54:00,973
"we're going to have to get-- I'm going to have to
get just a little bit of blood from all four of

2492
02:54:00,973 --> 02:54:05,211
"you, because we have to figure out who you are and
where you belong, so--"

2493
02:54:05,211 --> 02:54:06,639
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

2494
02:54:06,639 --> 02:54:11,240
TALIESIN: He pulls out a little pinprick and a
couple cups, a couple little wine glasses.

2495
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:16,036
TRAVIS: I stab my newly healing finger.

2496
02:54:16,036 --> 02:54:17,472
SAM: Re-slice open my wrist.

2497
02:54:17,472 --> 02:54:22,846
LAURA: I'm going to look for my big-- this vein
and I'm going to stick it in there.

2498
02:54:22,846 --> 02:54:24,801
TALIESIN: It doesn't really do what you were
hoping it was going to do, but you get some stuff

2499
02:54:24,801 --> 02:54:27,907
out of there. It is as if the circulation is not
really moving the way it's supposed to. You can

2500
02:54:27,907 --> 02:54:29,086
juice it.

2501
02:54:29,086 --> 02:54:32,696
SAM: Ugh. It personally makes me physically
uncomfortable.

2502
02:54:32,696 --> 02:54:35,327
TALIESIN: Yeah. It makes me so happy. It's all I'm
really going for.

2503
02:54:35,327 --> 02:54:40,052
LIAM: All my veins are noticeably large so I don't
think I have a problem.

2504
02:54:40,052 --> 02:54:45,803
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're a little crusty all over
too, but you get in there. Your skin got a little

2505
02:54:45,803 --> 02:54:46,791
crusty.

2506
02:54:46,791 --> 02:54:48,881
TRAVIS: Do you know what's wrong with Liam's
face?

2507
02:54:48,881 --> 02:54:50,548
TALIESIN: "Nothing's wrong with Liam's face. It's
totally normal."

2508
02:54:50,548 --> 02:54:52,179
LIAM: Nothing's wrong with Liam's face.

2509
02:54:52,179 --> 02:54:54,087
TRAVIS: I don't know how to break it to you, man.
You're a little flakey.

2510
02:54:54,087 --> 02:54:55,608
LAURA: <i>Almost</i> a lizard person.

2511
02:54:55,608 --> 02:54:57,816
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that's a tricky one. We're going
to have to deal with that."

2512
02:54:57,816 --> 02:54:59,555
LIAM: I've been like that for years, man!

2513
02:54:59,555 --> 02:55:00,383
TALIESIN: "Really?"

2514
02:55:00,383 --> 02:55:01,262
LIAM: Yeah.

2515
02:55:01,262 --> 02:55:06,026
LAURA: How much blood do you need? I filled the
cup up, like, halfway.

2516
02:55:06,026 --> 02:55:13,049
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that will do it." So everybody
gets a die. You got a hunger die. You got a hunger

2517
02:55:13,049 --> 02:55:16,681
die. You got a hunger die. You got a hunger die.

2518
02:55:16,681 --> 02:55:19,497
LIAM: Billy Mays here for vampirism!

2519
02:55:19,497 --> 02:55:30,176
TALIESIN: So they go take those in back. Yuri
gets up on stage, stops the DJ. "Ladies and

2520
02:55:30,176 --> 02:55:39,488
"gentlemen, we have a bit of a conundrum. Gary went
and did something dumb this week and I think we

2521
02:55:39,488 --> 02:55:44,756
"all saw it coming. He's been acting weird with the
end of Critical Role. He was getting a little

2522
02:55:44,756 --> 02:55:51,297
"depressed; he's been feeling bad for a while and
he may have taken matters into his own hands and

2523
02:55:51,297 --> 02:55:59,089
"it feels like it's caused a bit of a disruption.
We figured out some of it and thankfully, now

2524
02:55:59,089 --> 02:56:08,541
"we've contained most of the problem. But we have
these four right here. We're getting some results

2525
02:56:08,541 --> 02:56:12,014
"very soon, but is there anybody in the audience--
is there anybody here tonight who would like to

2526
02:56:12,014 --> 02:56:13,802
"sponsor one of these four?"

2527
02:56:13,802 --> 02:56:22,328
SAM: I'm going to take a step forward and say, as
a vampire, as a young, junior vampire, I feel like

2528
02:56:22,328 --> 02:56:35,173
I have a lot to offer. I have strength, maybe not
of body, but of spirit, clearly not mind. And I

2529
02:56:35,173 --> 02:56:45,734
feel like I can make any family proud with my nice-guy
attitude and optimism, which are traits that

2530
02:56:45,734 --> 02:56:52,410
vampires really need. (laughs) Thank you. I yield
the rest of my time.

2531
02:56:52,410 --> 02:56:57,506
TRAVIS: Wow. We all have to do that?

2532
02:56:57,506 --> 02:57:08,945
TALIESIN: Well, I'll tell you what. Really
quickly, give me your wits brawl.

2533
02:57:08,945 --> 02:57:10,051
LAURA: Brawl?

2534
02:57:10,051 --> 02:57:11,844
TALIESIN: Wits plus brawl.

2535
02:57:11,844 --> 02:57:13,595
SAM: I don't understand this game.

2536
02:57:13,595 --> 02:57:17,554
TALIESIN: No, you don't have to roll it. Just tell
me what's your number.

2537
02:57:17,554 --> 02:57:18,500
SAM: Six.

2538
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:23,466
TALIESIN: Your wits plus brawl is six total? All
right.

2539
02:57:23,466 --> 02:57:28,060
LAURA: Why fight when you got up and gave a
speech? Is somebody about to fight you?

2540
02:57:28,060 --> 02:57:29,574
TRAVIS: This fight is mine.

2541
02:57:29,574 --> 02:57:45,256
TALIESIN: All right. And give me... roll
perception and awareness?

2542
02:57:45,256 --> 02:57:48,559
SAM: Okay. Perception and awareness.

2543
02:57:48,559 --> 02:57:50,305
TALIESIN: Yeah. Really quickly.

2544
02:57:50,305 --> 02:57:56,789
SAM: Two successes, no fails.

2545
02:57:56,789 --> 02:57:59,126
TALIESIN: Okay. That will do.

2546
02:57:59,126 --> 02:58:06,263
LAURA: Oh. Kotori. That was the name. Yeah, that
was the name of the leader.

2547
02:58:06,263 --> 02:58:15,592
TALIESIN: You suddenly feel a weird pressure as a
piece of wood comes bursting out of the front of

2548
02:58:15,592 --> 02:58:16,608
your chest.

2549
02:58:16,608 --> 02:58:18,386
(gasping)

2550
02:58:18,386 --> 02:58:22,148
SAM: My family has chosen me.

2551
02:58:22,148 --> 02:58:24,260
LAURA: Did he die?

2552
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:25,624
TALIESIN: He's not dead.

2553
02:58:25,624 --> 02:58:27,356
LAURA: Sam!

2554
02:58:27,356 --> 02:58:34,930
TALIESIN: But you do take four points of health
damage. Four serious points of health damage.

2555
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:39,918
LIAM: Babe, does it hurt?

2556
02:58:39,918 --> 02:58:41,899
SAM: It hurts!

2557
02:58:41,899 --> 02:58:44,929
LIAM: But in a bearable way?

2558
02:58:44,929 --> 02:58:46,661
SAM: I'm going to try to shove it back through.

2559
02:58:46,661 --> 02:58:50,479
TALIESIN: While you're doing that--

2560
02:58:50,479 --> 02:58:54,364
SAM: Oh wait! I turn around to see who did it.

2561
02:58:54,364 --> 02:58:56,109
TALIESIN: You're going to turn around and see who
did it?

2562
02:58:56,109 --> 02:58:57,120
SAM: Yeah.

2563
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:00,135
TALIESIN: You turn around and it is, sadly, Satine
who had a stake there.

2564
02:59:00,135 --> 02:59:02,467
SAM: Can I attack her?

2565
02:59:02,467 --> 02:59:03,898
TRAVIS: She hated your dancing!

2566
02:59:03,898 --> 02:59:05,596
TALIESIN: You can--

2567
02:59:05,596 --> 02:59:09,299
LAURA: You shouldn't have tried to hit on that
girl after she told you no.

2568
02:59:09,299 --> 02:59:10,755
LIAM: Yeah, they don't like it here.

2569
02:59:10,755 --> 02:59:14,479
SAM: I was trying to find out who Yuri was!

2570
02:59:14,479 --> 02:59:18,728
LIAM: Yuri Lowenthal is a popular actor in both
games and animation.

2571
02:59:18,728 --> 02:59:21,648
SAM: Can I attack her?

2572
02:59:21,648 --> 02:59:27,002
TALIESIN: Yeah. Roll a-- let's see, that was a
surprise run, so--

2573
02:59:27,002 --> 02:59:30,436
SAM: Do I have to roll for initiative? How does this
work?

2574
02:59:30,436 --> 02:59:36,083
TALIESIN: Give me a-- what, you're going to try
and attack her? Give me another wits brawl. Wits

2575
02:59:36,083 --> 02:59:37,241
plus brawl.

2576
02:59:37,241 --> 02:59:38,734
SAM: You want me to roll that?

2577
02:59:38,734 --> 02:59:40,770
TALIESIN: Yeah, roll that, really quickly.

2578
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:42,636
SAM: Two success-- three successes.

2579
02:59:42,636 --> 03:00:01,337
TALIESIN: Yeah, you attempt to and it does not go
well. She takes a swing with a knife.

2580
03:00:01,337 --> 03:00:08,476
Roll a dex dodge. Oh boy.

2581
03:00:08,476 --> 03:00:11,884
SAM: Three successes.

2582
03:00:11,884 --> 03:00:13,434
LAURA: One critical success.

2583
03:00:13,434 --> 03:00:16,840
TALIESIN: One critical success. Yeah, you manage
to stumble out of the way and now you're rolling

2584
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:25,996
with a piece of wood in your chest. You're now
rolling into the front stage. "No takers on that

2585
03:00:25,996 --> 03:00:30,989
"one," Satine seems to say, looking at the three of
you. "Do you have something better to say?"

2586
03:00:30,989 --> 03:00:35,084
LAURA: Oh man. Should we talk or is it best to--

2587
03:00:35,084 --> 03:00:37,740
TALIESIN: The audience appears to be looking at
you. I can't tell you.

2588
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:40,388
SAM: (strained sounds)

2589
03:00:40,388 --> 03:00:49,728
TRAVIS: So my wife and I, you know, I think we're
open to all scenarios at this point. I'm extremely

2590
03:00:49,728 --> 03:00:58,817
strong. I'm not terribly ugly. I'll kill anybody
you want and I can also talk a lot less than that guy.

2591
03:00:58,817 --> 03:01:03,228
TALIESIN: Suddenly, out of the crowd--

2592
03:01:03,228 --> 03:01:06,894
SAM: (strained) He's never killed anyone! He
doesn't have any guts!

2593
03:01:06,894 --> 03:01:13,178
TALIESIN: --Wil Wheaton slowly walks up to you and
gives you a big hug.

2594
03:01:13,178 --> 03:01:15,591
LAURA: I give a big hug back. Please don't stab me
in the back.

2595
03:01:15,591 --> 03:01:16,815
TALIESIN: He's going to stab you in the back.

2596
03:01:16,815 --> 03:01:25,507
LAURA: I knew it. Why is he stabbing me?! Wil!
Titansgrave!

2597
03:01:25,507 --> 03:01:27,967
TALIESIN: Roll dex dodge.

2598
03:01:27,967 --> 03:01:31,561
LAURA: N-n-n-n-n-nineteen!

2599
03:01:31,561 --> 03:01:32,593
TALIESIN: Roll dex dodge.

2600
03:01:32,593 --> 03:01:34,251
TRAVIS: (singing) Five gold and a party!

2601
03:01:34,251 --> 03:01:37,190
TALIESIN: Oh boy! Wil rolls really well when I'm
rolling for him.

2602
03:01:37,190 --> 03:01:39,456
LAURA: Oh damn!

2603
03:01:39,456 --> 03:01:44,939
TRAVIS: You're the alpha and omega of 20s and ones.
The two of you.

2604
03:01:44,939 --> 03:01:47,202
LAURA: Two successes.

2605
03:01:47,202 --> 03:01:59,334
TALIESIN: I'm going to let this be a succeed at a
cost. You give him a shove, but there's like a

2606
03:01:59,334 --> 03:02:03,196
knife scrapes your back. As you shove away, you
take one point of damage.

2607
03:02:03,196 --> 03:02:07,218
LAURA: One point of-- Is that marked off on the
health?

2608
03:02:07,218 --> 03:02:08,429
TALIESIN: On the health. Yeah.

2609
03:02:08,429 --> 03:02:15,886
LAURA: Okay. Why? I thought we were buds!

2610
03:02:15,886 --> 03:02:24,085
LIAM: Geek and Sundry is in rubble. It's
destroyed. Marisha Ray is gone. You need someone

2611
03:02:24,085 --> 03:02:31,623
to rebuild the studio and lead it creatively and
while I have no experience--

2612
03:02:31,623 --> 03:02:34,717
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2613
03:02:34,717 --> 03:02:36,578
LIAM: I use Presence Awe.

2614
03:02:36,578 --> 03:02:37,956
TALIESIN: You use Presence Awe?

2615
03:02:37,956 --> 03:02:38,804
LIAM: Yes.

2616
03:02:38,804 --> 03:02:43,207
TALIESIN: On Wil? On Satine? On who? Erika is also
slowly walking towards you.

2617
03:02:43,207 --> 03:02:44,995
LAURA: She's going to kill you.

2618
03:02:44,995 --> 03:02:50,272
LIAM: I'll use it on Erika. No, Erika and I, we
bonded on Dread.

2619
03:02:50,272 --> 03:02:52,153
TRAVIS: Sure you did. (laughs)

2620
03:02:52,153 --> 03:02:53,595
LAURA: I thought Wil was my friend!

2621
03:02:53,595 --> 03:02:54,851
LIAM: I will use it on Erika.

2622
03:02:54,851 --> 03:02:55,950
TALIESIN: You're going to try and--

2623
03:02:55,950 --> 03:03:06,327
LIAM: You and I, Erika, will rebuild Geek and
Sundry. We will create a nest of creativity and

2624
03:03:06,327 --> 03:03:10,693
vampirism like the undead have never seen.

2625
03:03:10,693 --> 03:03:13,575
TALIESIN: Roll your dice, man. That was good!

2626
03:03:13,575 --> 03:03:15,668
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion.

2627
03:03:15,668 --> 03:03:19,381
LAURA: I got it because I didn't say anything.

2628
03:03:19,381 --> 03:03:20,772
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2629
03:03:20,772 --> 03:03:23,510
SAM: I got it because I <i>did</i> say something.
(laughs)

2630
03:03:23,510 --> 03:03:25,414
LAURA: Yeah, your speech was very poor. (laughs)

2631
03:03:25,414 --> 03:03:29,299
TRAVIS: It was like the worst Walmart job
application ever.

2632
03:03:29,299 --> 03:03:31,191
LAURA: It was so bad it scared me out of talking.

2633
03:03:31,191 --> 03:03:35,125
TRAVIS: I work well with others and I'm quite
affable--

2634
03:03:35,125 --> 03:03:38,202
LIAM: Two successes, one failure. Nothing on the
blood die.

2635
03:03:38,202 --> 03:03:51,071
TALIESIN: She seems receptive to it. She's
starting to get that smile.

2636
03:03:51,071 --> 03:03:59,523
LIAM: Remember those two days on Madness and
how fucking cool it was?

2637
03:03:59,523 --> 03:04:04,879
TALIESIN: And then you feel shoved from behind.
Someone just shoves you from behind.

2638
03:04:04,879 --> 03:04:13,030
LIAM: Erika. The magic we had, the theatre <i>we</i>
had--

2639
03:04:13,030 --> 03:04:19,886
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that did it. And now a stake
hits you right in the back. Erika's still staring

2640
03:04:19,886 --> 03:04:21,347
at you.

2641
03:04:21,347 --> 03:04:24,185
LIAM: (strained) You want to help me, Erika?

2642
03:04:24,185 --> 03:04:27,859
TALIESIN: "I do, but my boss would get really mad
at me."

2643
03:04:27,859 --> 03:04:29,906
LIAM: (strained) Who is it?

2644
03:04:29,906 --> 03:04:40,025
TALIESIN: And behind you is Felicia Day, staring
down going, "No. Oh no."

2645
03:04:40,025 --> 03:04:41,774
LIAM: (strained) I'm clearly out-classed here.

2646
03:04:41,774 --> 03:04:43,336
TALIESIN: "I know."

2647
03:04:43,336 --> 03:04:51,893
SAM: Wait. I'm going to try-- I'm going to scream
a primal scream and say, I'll show you what a

2648
03:04:51,893 --> 03:05:01,466
<i>real</i> vampire is! And I'll run using my super
speed at Satine with the stake that's sticking out

2649
03:05:01,466 --> 03:05:07,409
of my body and just hug her in the heart and try
to jam it into her chest.

2650
03:05:07,409 --> 03:05:09,172
TALIESIN: Roll strength brawl.

2651
03:05:09,172 --> 03:05:11,262
LAURA: What about Travis? Did nobody stab Travis?

2652
03:05:11,262 --> 03:05:12,677
TALIESIN: No one stabbed Travis.

2653
03:05:12,677 --> 03:05:17,608
SAM: Three successes, no fails.

2654
03:05:17,608 --> 03:05:27,470
TALIESIN: It works! You are pinned to her and she
takes the pain and it's-- how much are we doing

2655
03:05:27,470 --> 03:05:35,284
here? Stakes are mean. You haven't-- and I'm going
to let her, since you're now top to bottom and

2656
03:05:35,284 --> 03:05:47,843
you're holding on. Okay. She is going to just take
her knife and start cutting your head right off.

2657
03:05:47,843 --> 03:05:49,607
SAM: Can I dodge it?

2658
03:05:49,607 --> 03:05:51,884
TALIESIN: You are literally pinned to her like a
thumbtack.

2659
03:05:51,884 --> 03:05:53,914
SAM: But I have an incredibly fast response time.

2660
03:05:53,914 --> 03:05:54,884
TALIESIN: You do.

2661
03:05:54,884 --> 03:06:01,838
SAM: My initiative doubles, can use dodge skill
against firearms.

2662
03:06:01,838 --> 03:06:06,331
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you can try to dodge
out of the way. That was a really good-- you just

2663
03:06:06,331 --> 03:06:09,151
knocked her and she went straight up for it so you
should try.

2664
03:06:09,151 --> 03:06:10,712
SAM: So what am I rolling?

2665
03:06:10,712 --> 03:06:16,323
TALIESIN: That would be a-- that's your initiative
roll, so it would be a dex dodge.

2666
03:06:16,323 --> 03:06:22,449
SAM: Dex dodge. Two successes.

2667
03:06:22,449 --> 03:06:28,315
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. Yeah, you're looking pretty
rough.

2668
03:06:28,315 --> 03:06:30,124
SAM: I'm going to take more points.

2669
03:06:30,124 --> 03:06:34,460
TALIESIN: That was five more points of health.

2670
03:06:34,460 --> 03:06:37,083
SAM: I'm dead. That's it.

2671
03:06:37,083 --> 03:06:39,326
TALIESIN: You're starting to powder on the floor.

2672
03:06:39,326 --> 03:06:47,820
LIAM: (strained) Felicia, I'm a big fan of Dr.
Horrible, <i>big</i> fucking fan of Dr. Horrible. I get

2673
03:06:47,820 --> 03:06:53,601
it. Tough love. We're ready. (normal voice) I use
Awe again. Presence Awe again.

2674
03:06:53,601 --> 03:06:55,517
LAURA: On the Grand Poobah.

2675
03:06:55,517 --> 03:06:57,095
LIAM: (strained) That's right. I do.

2676
03:06:57,095 --> 03:06:58,858
TALIESIN: Roll a blood die and then roll a...

2677
03:06:58,858 --> 03:07:14,655
LIAM: Loyal as the day is long. Okay. Three
successes, no failures.

2678
03:07:14,655 --> 03:07:18,452
SAM: (laughs)

2679
03:07:18,452 --> 03:07:22,290
LAURA: I saved your life!

2680
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:26,852
LIAM: Ten thousand years of Day. And not the bad
kind.

2681
03:07:26,852 --> 03:07:35,088
TALIESIN: "I'm really sorry, Liam, but this is
just not the kind of content we're really looking

2682
03:07:35,088 --> 03:07:40,509
"to make right now. But, really, thank you for
everything. Thank you for all of this and I'm so

2683
03:07:40,509 --> 03:07:48,671
"sorry. Sorry. It's going to hurt a little. I'm
trying to make it not hurt. Sorry!" And she takes

2684
03:07:48,671 --> 03:07:57,838
a stab. Pushes a little deeper. Yeah, you're
staked and down and you're not probably getting

2685
03:07:57,838 --> 03:07:59,790
back up.

2686
03:07:59,790 --> 03:08:02,386
LAURA: I'm just slashed across the back still?

2687
03:08:02,386 --> 03:08:04,081
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2688
03:08:04,081 --> 03:08:15,095
TRAVIS: If I could, my wife is a fantastic person
and she understands how valuable the relationship

2689
03:08:15,095 --> 03:08:22,993
between the vampire world and the human world is
and how much it must be protected. Such a delicate

2690
03:08:22,993 --> 03:08:23,919
balance.

2691
03:08:23,919 --> 03:08:28,021
LAURA: I read a lot of vampire novels, I've watched a
lot of movies.

2692
03:08:28,078 --> 03:08:33,450
TRAVIS: We are here to disappear and never cause a
bit of trouble and only to learn.

2693
03:08:33,450 --> 03:08:37,376
LAURA: I played a vampire in Skyrim, and in
Bloodrayne.

2694
03:08:37,376 --> 03:08:41,017
TALIESIN: "Yeah, but she tastes of death."

2695
03:08:41,017 --> 03:08:44,024
TRAVIS: I knew it. (laughs)

2696
03:08:44,024 --> 03:08:52,155
LAURA: Here's the thing. Nobody told us we weren't
supposed to do that. I didn't know. It was fight

2697
03:08:52,155 --> 03:08:58,746
or flight at that point and as soon we got out to
the real world and we were around actual humans

2698
03:08:58,746 --> 03:09:00,332
and I realised it wasn't the apocalypse--

2699
03:09:00,332 --> 03:09:01,472
TRAVIS: She was very remorseful.

2700
03:09:01,472 --> 03:09:02,956
LAURA: I kept him from killing somebody!

2701
03:09:02,956 --> 03:09:07,189
TRAVIS: I would have taken a life if it hadn't
been for her. If one of us can only enter this

2702
03:09:07,189 --> 03:09:10,092
world, I would ask that it be her.

2703
03:09:10,092 --> 03:09:14,532
LAURA: Oh, babe. That's really sweet. No, I'm not
okay with that.

2704
03:09:14,532 --> 03:09:19,357
LIAM: (strained) You were supposed to protect me!

2705
03:09:19,357 --> 03:09:21,974
(laughter)

2706
03:09:21,974 --> 03:09:29,670
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I suddenly feel
this lingering shame and guilt. But as the person

2707
03:09:29,670 --> 03:09:32,194
who applied it is now dead, I don't feel--

2708
03:09:32,194 --> 03:09:34,897
TALIESIN: Make a charisma persuasion roll.

2709
03:09:34,897 --> 03:09:37,646
LAURA: Can I help him? Can I aid him?

2710
03:09:37,646 --> 03:09:39,004
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can help him.

2711
03:09:39,004 --> 03:09:40,020
LAURA: What do I do?

2712
03:09:40,020 --> 03:09:41,794
TALIESIN: Charisma persuasion. You just add your
successes together.

2713
03:09:41,794 --> 03:09:42,852
LAURA: Okay.

2714
03:09:42,852 --> 03:09:51,642
TALIESIN: You could burn a willpower.

2715
03:09:51,642 --> 03:09:52,984
TRAVIS: I will burn a willpower.

2716
03:09:52,984 --> 03:09:55,315
TALIESIN: You can reroll any you like, as many as
you like.

2717
03:09:55,315 --> 03:10:03,188
LAURA: I have a critical success. I have two tens,
and two more successes outside of that. So four

2718
03:10:03,188 --> 03:10:04,700
successes, two of them are critical.

2719
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:09,053
TRAVIS: I now have five successes and no
failures.

2720
03:10:09,053 --> 03:10:18,869
TALIESIN: Out of the back room runs Mary
Elizabeth, who goes, "I'll take that one! It's

2721
03:10:18,869 --> 03:10:20,627
"okay. I've got this one."

2722
03:10:20,627 --> 03:10:22,536
LAURA: Mary, which one? Travis or--

2723
03:10:22,536 --> 03:10:23,444
TALIESIN: "You."

2724
03:10:23,444 --> 03:10:24,765
LAURA: You're taking me? You're going to adopt
me?

2725
03:10:24,765 --> 03:10:29,057
TALIESIN: She takes you and goes over.

2726
03:10:29,057 --> 03:10:32,918
LAURA: Oh my god. What about Stove?

2727
03:10:32,918 --> 03:10:37,986
TALIESIN: Satine walks over to you and goes, "Oh
no, you're fine. You don't smell of death."

2728
03:10:37,986 --> 03:10:47,849
TRAVIS: Oh good. No, I would <i>never have</i> stepped
into that-- that's a fool's errand. I know better.

2729
03:10:47,849 --> 03:10:53,553
TALIESIN: "Well then, we will say, welcome to the
Tremere family."

2730
03:10:53,553 --> 03:10:55,622
TRAVIS: The Tremere family!

2731
03:10:55,622 --> 03:11:03,408
TALIESIN: "And welcome to the Toreador family.
We'll train you, we will talk and we will see what else--"

2732
03:11:03,408 --> 03:11:06,211
LAURA: Are we cool that we're still married and
we're in different families?

2733
03:11:06,211 --> 03:11:07,352
TALIESIN: "Oh yes."

2734
03:11:07,352 --> 03:11:08,432
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2735
03:11:08,432 --> 03:11:12,777
TALIESIN: "We will sleep for the day and then in
the morning we will figure out precisely what it

2736
03:11:12,777 --> 03:11:17,952
"is that you can do and who may have been
responsible for creating you in the first place."

2737
03:11:17,952 --> 03:11:22,452
TRAVIS: Do I get a hint as to who my honorable
sponsor might be?

2738
03:11:22,452 --> 03:11:24,558
LAURA : It's Satine!

2739
03:11:24,558 --> 03:11:25,626
TALIESIN: Satine.

2740
03:11:25,626 --> 03:11:26,727
TRAVIS: Oh, fantastic.

2741
03:11:26,727 --> 03:11:27,953
TALIESIN: Satine's taking you.

2742
03:11:27,953 --> 03:11:29,294
TRAVIS: I'm thrilled.

2743
03:11:29,294 --> 03:11:32,977
TALIESIN: Well done for not--

2744
03:11:32,977 --> 03:11:34,659
TRAVIS: She's a really good sponsor!

2745
03:11:34,659 --> 03:11:42,724
TALIESIN: And with that, they lead you to the
basement of the club, where there are clean, fresh

2746
03:11:42,724 --> 03:11:44,949
coffins for everybody to sleep in.

2747
03:11:44,949 --> 03:11:47,435
LAURA: What happens to those dead bodies that are
up there?

2748
03:11:47,435 --> 03:11:49,851
TALIESIN: They're powder.

2749
03:11:49,851 --> 03:11:53,350
LIAM: As we're dying, I reach my hand and finds
Sam's.

2750
03:11:53,350 --> 03:11:54,765
SAM: I hold his hand.

2751
03:11:54,765 --> 03:11:58,165
LIAM: As we're fading away: (dying voice) Why is
our life so ridiculous?

2752
03:11:58,165 --> 03:12:00,933
SAM: (dying voice) On the next episode of All Work
No Play!

2753
03:12:00,933 --> 03:12:08,336
TALIESIN: Wow, I was really hoping to TPK
everyone, but you guys made it through the

2754
03:12:08,336 --> 03:12:11,683
evening. All you had to do was to kill Diva and
that would have been the fucking end of it.

2755
03:12:11,683 --> 03:12:14,463
LAURA: I saved you! See, it was good!

2756
03:12:14,463 --> 03:12:17,152
TALIESIN: Thank you, everybody, for letting me--

2757
03:12:17,152 --> 03:12:19,076
LAURA: Wait, what happened to Taliesin?

2758
03:12:19,076 --> 03:12:20,718
TALIESIN: You don't know what happened to
Taliesin.

2759
03:12:20,718 --> 03:12:22,696
TRAVIS: What do you mean, we don't 
know what happened to Taliesin?

2760
03:12:22,696 --> 03:12:24,467
TALIESIN: I know what happened to Taliesin.

2761
03:12:24,467 --> 03:12:26,432
TRAVIS: Could we have found him in the one-shot?

2762
03:12:26,432 --> 03:12:27,547
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2763
03:12:27,547 --> 03:12:28,668
TRAVIS and LAURA: We missed him?!

2764
03:12:28,668 --> 03:12:29,718
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2765
03:12:29,718 --> 03:12:31,497
LIAM: There was no Taliesin in the champagne
room.

2766
03:12:31,497 --> 03:12:33,305
LAURA: Oh no, was he upstairs with the
werewolves?

2767
03:12:33,305 --> 03:12:34,117
TALIESIN: No.

2768
03:12:34,117 --> 03:12:35,909
TRAVIS: We're not going to have a Talks this week
because it's Halloween.

2769
03:12:35,909 --> 03:12:37,511
TALIESIN: Yeah, Taliesin was in the back room.

2770
03:12:37,511 --> 03:12:39,059
LIAM: He's here, tonight?

2771
03:12:39,059 --> 03:12:40,293
TRAVIS: Where Mary came from?

2772
03:12:40,293 --> 03:12:41,242
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2773
03:12:41,242 --> 03:12:44,007
SAM: Wait, the back room where Mary was or the
back room where--

2774
03:12:44,007 --> 03:12:46,428
LAURA: Wait a minute. How come Taliesin didn't
come to our defense?

2775
03:12:46,428 --> 03:12:53,118
TALIESIN: Because he was in a cage. It's a long
story. We'll get there one day. Taliesin was not

2776
03:12:53,118 --> 03:12:57,167
doing well. He may have done some bad things.

2777
03:12:57,167 --> 03:13:00,390
LIAM: May have. Wow.

2778
03:13:00,390 --> 03:13:05,993
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got to say, this is a
wonderful system that I'm a very big fan of and

2779
03:13:05,993 --> 03:13:08,134
thank you all for joining me in this ridiculousness.

2780
03:13:08,134 --> 03:13:09,814
TRAVIS: Nicely done!

2781
03:13:09,814 --> 03:13:16,719
TALIESIN: I was really hoping to give you guys the
TPK you all wanted but fucking Laura just had to

2782
03:13:16,719 --> 03:13:22,280
be a good guy and let Diva live. It's okay. It's
great. She saved your ass, man.

2783
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:23,291
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2784
03:13:23,291 --> 03:13:29,199
TALIESIN: And then you saved hers, to be fair. She
was going to go, too.

2785
03:13:29,199 --> 03:13:33,182
LIAM: I'll see you in your dreams, Friedle.

2786
03:13:33,182 --> 03:13:40,388
TALIESIN: So if you guys want the v5 alpha,
there's a little playthrough online that you can

2787
03:13:40,388 --> 03:13:45,765
find. I'm sure someone in the chat can lead you to
it. Also, Onyx has got reams of stories of the old

2788
03:13:45,765 --> 03:13:51,756
books for this game, including Live Action
Role-Playing. There used to be these great City by

2789
03:13:51,756 --> 03:13:57,571
Night books: LA by Night, New York by Night and
all these wonderful references. I always love

2790
03:13:57,571 --> 03:14:01,698
that you can pull interesting-- these are great
characters for pulling weird historical bits of

2791
03:14:01,698 --> 03:14:08,980
different cities out, because some of these people
actually lived to see it, which is always fun. So

2792
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:14,292
yeah, look up the lizard people in LA and
those were fun. Those were real things and Los

2793
03:14:14,292 --> 03:14:16,469
Globos is a weird little club in LA.

2794
03:14:16,469 --> 03:14:17,648
TRAVIS: Still up and running?

2795
03:14:17,648 --> 03:14:22,238
TALIESIN: Still up and running. It's where Das
Bunker happens and sorry, Diva, for-- thank god we

2796
03:14:22,238 --> 03:14:28,204
did not kill Diva and Manzey. We love you both
very much. And thank you for everybody who's

2797
03:14:28,204 --> 03:14:33,409
watched this evening. Thank you for everybody who
offered to be a sacrifice for this episode. I did

2798
03:14:33,409 --> 03:14:38,162
see you, but I was not prepared to kill Critters
yet and thank you for not killing the one Critter

2799
03:14:38,162 --> 03:14:41,984
I gave you. Although I would have been really
interested to see if you guys had eaten lizard

2800
03:14:41,984 --> 03:14:45,821
people. That was an option. Their blood would have
been weird.

2801
03:14:45,821 --> 03:14:47,846
TRAVIS: Starts taking some of its
characteristics?

2802
03:14:47,846 --> 03:14:53,276
TALIESIN: Yeah. I had some interesting rules I
brewed up for eating lizard people and how it

2803
03:14:53,276 --> 03:14:59,663
would affect you. This has been fun. This has been
exhausting. I can't believe Matt Mercer does this

2804
03:14:59,663 --> 03:15:07,757
<i>every</i> week. I'm ready to pull my mohawk off. I
may have already pulled my mohawk off. Oh god. And

2805
03:15:07,757 --> 03:15:10,650
next week, it's going to be you.

2806
03:15:10,650 --> 03:15:14,796
TRAVIS: My turn. Yeah. Actually, Grog's turn. It's
not me.

2807
03:15:14,796 --> 03:15:16,843
LAURA: Grog is DM.

2808
03:15:16,843 --> 03:15:20,307
TALIESIN: Thank you everybody. I hope you have a
wonderful Halloween weekend if you have time

2809
03:15:20,307 --> 03:15:29,102
tomorrow. Thank you to our sponsor, Tor Books. And
if you have time to check out some of our other

2810
03:15:29,102 --> 03:15:33,254
shows, we've got Madness this weekend that you can
check out and Gather Your Party tomorrow, where

2811
03:15:33,254 --> 03:15:35,095
I'm going to be wearing something super fancy.

2812
03:15:35,095 --> 03:15:36,557
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

2813
03:15:36,557 --> 03:15:41,518
TALIESIN: Yeah. Thank you all, have a pleasant
evening and is it Thursday night yet?

2814
03:15:41,518 --> 03:15:43,868
TRAVIS: Happy Halloween!

2815
03:15:43,868 --> 03:15:47,075
TALIESIN: Happy Halloween! (evil laughter)

2816
03:15:47,075 --> 03:24:49,668
