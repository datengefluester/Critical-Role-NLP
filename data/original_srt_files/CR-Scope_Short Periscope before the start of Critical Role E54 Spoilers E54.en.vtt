NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.350
LIAM: Oh. Okay. Are we in? Okay, we're three
minutes away, we're told, from playing Dungeons &

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.318
Dragons.

00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:11.469
LAURA: Roll for jelly beans!

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.531
LIAM: Roll for jelly beans! We're using only these
tonight. Look at this! Sneak attack damage! Ooh,

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.230
strawberry and watermelon!

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.361
MARISHA: The buttered popcorn's like 1d12, all
right?

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:25.581
LAURA: The buttered popcorn, combine it with the
s'mores one, or the root beer, or the cream soda

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:27.851
one and it is delicious.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.521
LIAM: You cannot have any.

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:36.359
LAURA: No I think, wait. Chocolate pudding,
buttered popcorn, and marshmallow you can make a

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.110
s'more and it's delicious.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.149
LIAM: Whoop! Oh my god, you broke my phone!

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.411
LAURA: Stop it!

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.381
LIAM and TRAVIS: Sumbitch!

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.682
LAURA: That was a good one.

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:56.021
LIAM: Look at Sam. He's so serious about this
game. He's so serious. He's too in-character.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:01.019
SAM: Guys, this is going to be a night to remember
once we begin.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.521
TRAVIS: It's going to be like prom.

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.669
SAM: Whoa!

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:05.319
TRAVIS: It's made of gold!

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.553
LAURA: Oh, I like it!

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:14.960
LIAM: Here's mine. You've seen it before. It's the
one with daggers built into it and I can stick it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.679
right into Laura's ribs if she makes me mad. She
hasn't made me that mad yet, but it's inevitable.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.489
LAURA: I haven't sorted out my dice for tonight
yet, but I've got this gold one. In fact, I've got

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:31.417
two gold ones. They're so fancy. I've got this
little bitty one of amethyst.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.629
LIAM: Oh, sneak attack!

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:34.989
LAURA: No!

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.369
LIAM: What about you? Do you have any dice?

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.069
ASHLEY: I really like this one. It's like a Celtic
situation. That was a present.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010
LIAM: That's some Hell Raiser shit right there.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:56.012
ASHLEY: Yeah. I also really like this one. It's
real pretty. This is my very first d20 which I

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:57.661
want to burn.

00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:03.531
LAURA: Inside of my bag that I sort through. This
is just one of the bags, just one of them.

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.117
LIAM: That's bag number 22.

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:09.990
LAURA: Here's my Hail of Thorns one.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.240
LIAM: Look here. This one was given to me by
Matthew Colville. It's made from a meteorite. It's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.031
iron that fell to the earth and it's made of
aliens. Look, there's the dungeon master over

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.588
there. He's thinking about killing us all.

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:31.361
MATT: Sorry, there was a really good Taliesin face
suddenly on-screen.

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:34.090
LIAM: Ooh, snap!

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240
LAURA: I was aiming at Travis!

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.560
SAM: You nailed her!

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.572
MARISHA: You really did! I kind of half--

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:43.170
LAURA: I'm so sorry!

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.512
LIAM: You guys are all asking questions. Okay.
Here comes.

00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:52.899
(cheering)

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.311
MARISHA: That was pretty good!

00:02:54.311 --> 00:03:00.940
LIAM: Look. Check this out. Look at this asshole
over here. Oh, he's in Hawaii, sucker!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.638
TALIESIN: (cackling)

00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:07.571
MARISHA: And he's in a hotel room playing D&D so,
ha, joke's on him.

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:19.929
LIAM: Listen. We don't know what's going to
happen. We're contractually obligated to having a

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:27.310
possible TPK every other week. Get your Imodium
ready. Get your whiskey ready.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.310
LAURA: I know! Anyway, which 2nd-level should I
take?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.998
LIAM: You should take Fart Detection and Fart
Silencing.

00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:46.181
LAURA: I think it's going to be Spike Growth
because I had that for a second and I liked it.

00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.019
LIAM: What are you doing? What are we talking
about?

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.280
LAURA: Well, I leveled up and I realized when I
was going through my stats that I had all these

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.860
spells that I could've learned that I never
learned. I had a level one, a level two, and a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.722
level <i>three</i> spell that I never learned! So now I
get to pick those and add them to my list.

00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:05.109
LIAM: I think you should level up into barrette
for your bangs.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.950
LAURA: Little arrow barrettes?

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.071
LIAM: That's a challenge!

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:13.302
LAURA: No, I love my little Trinket barrette!

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:18.179
LIAM: Ooh! All right. I'm sure it's going to be 30
more minutes before we start, but I'm going to

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:23.740
hang up in case it's in 30 seconds. Love you all and
we'll see you soon. We're all going to die. Bye!
