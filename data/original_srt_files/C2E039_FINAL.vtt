NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.422
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:06.253
nerdy ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:08.907
(cheering)

00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:12.701
MATT: Before we get into tonight's episode, we're
going to do some quick announcements. First and

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.873
foremost, we brought tonight our fantastic
returning sponsor for campaign 2, our friends at

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:19.544
D&D Beyond! Sam!

00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:31.200
SAM: Hi guys. Tonight's ad copy was a little long,
so I tried to make a nursery rhyme out of it. I

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:37.864
couldn't crack it. I couldn't make it funny.
Instead, I decided I'm going to read the copy

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:44.211
while they paint my face. That is the bit. Laura
and Travis have free reign to paint anything they

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.576
want on my face.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:47.446
LAURA: This is Taliesin.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:48.835
TALIESIN: You obviously can't read while I'm
painting your face.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:53.958
SAM: D&D Beyond has teamed up with Beadle &
Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse on the platinum

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:59.536
edition of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, which releases
in November. If you don't know what Beadle &

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:03.329
Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse is, it's the
brainchild of friend of the show Matt Lillard.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.823
They make these fantastic boxes filled with all
the elements a dungeon master needs to create an

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:10.410
amazing experience. That's in my eye.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.462
(laughter)

00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:15.702
TALIESIN: Say it with me: you did this to
yourself.

00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:20.790
SAM: With maps and counter cards and one of a kind
figures to make your tabletop experience come to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.346
life! That's not all, every Beadle & Grimm's
Waterdeep: Dragon Heist platinum box sold will

00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:34.825
include access to Waterdeep: Dragon Heist on D&D
Beyond! For the next week, Beadle & Grimm's is

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:42.037
offering a $50 discount to purchase the box for
registered D&D Beyond users. That's $50! With the

00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:46.755
money you saved, you could buy two Critical Role
sleeveless Keyfish t-shirts now available in the

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:53.488
CritRole shop. Or one Nott the Brave t-shirt and
one All Work No Play t-shirt that doesn't exist,

00:01:53.488 --> 00:02:02.148
yet? I digress; this isn't about the merch I want
to make for our beloved Malaysian fans. It's about

00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:12.515
D&D Beyond! Specifically Beadle and-- ow!--
Grimm's Waterdeep: Dragon Heist! To get your

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:18.211
discount code, go to

over 140 items in each box! Some highlights

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:44.968

Nolzur's unpainted minis, a beautiful four panel

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:51.913
DM screen created especially for Waterdeep, all
sorts of maps, and much more. In conclusion, get

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:57.671

00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:59.586
(laughter)

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:03.809
SAM: Thank you, Laura and Taliesin. How do I
look?

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.535
MATT: You look about as good a a job as Jester did
to Yasha last week.

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:09.076
LAURA and TALIESIN: He's a snake person!

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:10.305
MATT: Good job!

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:14.720
SAM: Am I something? Or is it just dicks?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.080
TRAVIS: There's an explosion on the left side of
your face. Then you got punched to the right side

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.826
of your face. It's kind of great.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.022
MATT: I'd put it at a natural two.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:29.819
LAURA: Whoa, my natural one must have been real
shit.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.861
TRAVIS: It looks like you got bloody raw meat on
your lower--

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.859
MARISHA: I feel like it's if Nott was going for a
Bowie vibe.

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.216
MATT: How's it smell?

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:40.372
SAM: It smells like farts.

00:03:40.372 --> 00:03:42.954
(laughter)

00:03:42.954 --> 00:03:46.091
TRAVIS: Context! The face paint smells like
farts.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:52.268
SAM: Before we started rolling, this paint smells
like farts. But only when it's painted on a human face.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.550
(laughter)

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.583
TRAVIS: You're going to get sick by the halfway
point.

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:03.328
SAM: Beadle and Grimm's,
dndbeyond.com/promotions/platinum.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:11.292
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&D Beyond. Thank
you, Matt Lillard and friends at Beadle and Grimm's.

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:12.564
TRAVIS: It's a gorgeous box.

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:20.143
MATT: It's awesome. Up next, the latest episode of
Between the Sheets featuring our fantastic snake

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:26.624
person, Sam Riegel. Emmy award winning snake
person, Sam Riegel, is now available on the

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:30.053
Critical Role YouTube channel if you missed it on
Monday. You can find it on

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:37.142
youtube.com/criticalrole. Look forward to this
coming Monday at 7:00pm for the new Between

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:40.731
the Sheets starring our fantastic creative
director and my wife, Marisha Ray.

00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:42.255
(cheering)

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:47.685
LIAM: Not even paying attention. BTS Monday!
Marisha Ray!

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:49.931
MARISHA: Yay!

00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.079
MATT: She's so hard at work that she's not even
present when we're announcing her show.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.485
LIAM: She's seriously working all the time.

00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:04.889
MATT: Look forward to that on Monday at 7:00pm
Pacific on twitch.tv/criticalrole. You can see the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.252
next episode of All Work No Play tomorrow at the
same Twitch channel.

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:10.653
LIAM: It's a special one.

00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:17.628
MATT: This one, both Liam and Sam are getting some
special character creature makeup just like this.

00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:18.524
SAM: No, no.

00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:19.278
LIAM: Incorrect.

00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:20.552
SAM: Wait, is that tomorrow? No.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:22.145
MARISHA: No. That is incorrect.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.280
SAM: Spoilers!

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.645
MATT: My sheet is incorrectly filled out!

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:28.547
MARISHA: That is a spoiler, like a week ahead.

00:05:28.547 --> 00:05:30.847
SAM: I think tomorrow is goat yoga.

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:31.860
MATT: Oh!

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.638
SAM: Featuring Travis Willingham and friend of the
show, TJ Storm. It's going to be fun. There's

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:41.567
goats involved. There's yoga involved. We talk LA.
It's great.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:42.290
MARISHA: Yes.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.563
MATT: There you go.

00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:46.471
LIAM: I'll only say one word. Butts.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.531
TRAVIS: Lots of butts.

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.449
MATT: There you go.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.522
SAM: Butts and taints.

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:54.413
MATT: Lots of butts. Lots of TJ Storm and lots of
goat yoga tomorrow here at 7:00pm Pacific on

00:05:54.413 --> 00:06:01.275
twitch.tv/criticalrole. Check it out then. We are
headed overseas next week to MCM London to come

00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:03.370
meet a bunch of you awesome European Critters.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.574
SAM: (Australian accent) G'day mate!

00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:09.561
MATT: We're super excited about it. We'll be there
on October 27th and October 28th. For more info,

00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:15.315
you can got to critrole.com. Last but not least,
Laura Bailey is running a very special one-shot

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:16.686
next Thursday.

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:19.584
LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's happening!

00:06:19.584 --> 00:06:23.264
MATT: We're pre-recording an episode because at
the time that the show happens next Thursday,

00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:28.614
we're going to be on an airplane going to
aforementioned MCM London. We're taking a week off

00:06:28.614 --> 00:06:32.359
from the main storyline so that Laura Bailey can
run her very first one-shot.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.498
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:35.078
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:36.369
MATT: It's going to be great.

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:38.343
LAURA: Like ridiculously nervous.

00:06:38.343 --> 00:06:40.185
SAM: Do you know all the rules and stuff?

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:41.979
LAURA: I know nothing.

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:42.944
TRAVIS: That's all you need.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:43.859
MATT: She's never played.

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:44.466
LAURA: Ever.

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:49.403
MATT: (laughs) You can check that out next
Thursday, October 25th at this time, 7:00pm

00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:56.423
Pacific, in place of Critical Role on Geek &
Sundry's Twitch, YouTube, and Alpha channels. I

00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:04.130
think that's the extent of our announcements for
tonight. That brings us into the next episode of

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.530
Critical Role!

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.524
LIAM: Yaas, yuan-ti!

00:07:07.524 --> 00:07:12.053
[TV static, click]

00:07:12.053 --> 00:08:30.102
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:37.863
MATT: Welcome back everybody. Last we left off,
The Mighty Nein had found their way south outside

00:08:37.953 --> 00:08:45.023
of the Empire on the coast of the Menagerie Coast,
stolen a pirate ship, apparently. Following a

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:50.371
thread to pursue aspects of the mystery of Fjord's
background and the relationship to his mysterious

00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:59.006
patron, followed a mostly charred map to an island
known as Urukaxl. Passing the dangerous reefs, you

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:04.426
came upon the mother ship to the ship that you had
stolen, known as the Squalleater, which was then,

00:09:04.426 --> 00:09:11.734
you realized, helmed by Captain Avantika, who gave
you the option of either working with her under

00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:20.882
her guise as, essentially, currently captives and
maybe eventually crewmen of the ship, or be killed

00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:28.283
and left in the harbor, held down with rocks and
die. You took her up on the offer. You also

00:09:28.283 --> 00:09:33.449
discovered that she seems to be as enthralled with
this same entity as Fjord is and has some sort of

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:40.359
similar history with how this serpentine entity
known as--

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:42.422
TRAVIS: Uk'otoa.

00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:44.172
MATT: Uk'otoa. You remembered. Good job.

00:09:44.172 --> 00:09:46.115
LAURA and SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:50.523
MATT: Uk'otoa, once a creation of Zehir, the
Cloaked Serpent god, now banished since the

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:59.142
Calamity. This entity then began to build its own
following, and the followers of Zehir, this old

00:09:59.142 --> 00:10:06.229
god, this once creator grew jealous and sealed it
away. Now, Avantika, with your help, is working to

00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:12.863
begin to release these seals, bring it back, and
as such, gain the blessings and boons of this

00:10:12.863 --> 00:10:20.330
entity. You decided to go into the jungle with her
on this mission alongside an adventurer, a

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:28.511
dungeoneer who had plotted out some of the path
for you, named Jamedi. You had made your way

00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:37.437
through, avoiding hunting parties of lizard men
being hunted by yuan-ti snake people. You made

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:42.890
your way towards a mostly stone-crafted village in
the center of this island that surrounded one

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:51.809
large old temple. You snuck in, masquerading as
some of these snake people and mostly succeeded,

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:54.389
managed to sneak your way through part of the
town, gathering some attention. You threw up some

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:59.393
distracting illusions. You quickly killed off a
few of them that had begun to grow wise to your

00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:04.967
presence, not being naturally wanted, and in the
midst of the commotion, you raced up the steps of

00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:12.201
the temple, managed to kick one of the sentries
off the side, found a way through the top, and

00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:19.123
closed it off, locking behind the very top of this
five-sided pyramid. Now, once inside, you began to

00:11:19.123 --> 00:11:24.602
descend slowly down the curved stairs, but in
missing a trap that was present, triggered it. The

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:31.446
stairs went smooth, and the entire party slid down
this slide, Goonies-style before impacting into

00:11:31.446 --> 00:11:38.289
the ground of one of the top chambers of the
pyramid. Looking within the interior of this

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:44.376
five-sided chamber, you noticed amongst the two
pillars to the side a raised platform where there

00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:49.832
was a fountain of some kind surrounded by three of
these mostly humanoid, but

00:11:49.832 --> 00:11:58.828
snake-scale-covered-in-places yuan-ti people and
one with gray, armored, scaly skin, mostly human

00:11:58.828 --> 00:12:05.006
body though tall and lanky, and a head that was
purely cobra-like. The hood exposed as all of them

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:10.745
turn to your direction as you impact with the
stone, and are made aware of your presence. With

00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:15.022
that, Mighty Nein, I would like for you to roll
initiative.

00:12:15.022 --> 00:12:18.135
(exclamations)

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:24.919
LIAM: Do I get any jump on that Slow spell I
tossed out at the last second of the episode?

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.568
Yeah, I said "I start casting Slow," and you said,
"That's where we'll pick up next week."

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:32.445
MATT: Yes, you will, and that'll be your turn,
because literally-- it's not so much a stand-- you

00:12:32.445 --> 00:12:38.069
just slid down and hit the ground, and you just
take a moment to take in the scenario and then now

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:39.347
we get to be--

00:12:39.347 --> 00:12:40.256
LIAM: Had to ask.

00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:40.836
MATT: No worries.

00:12:40.836 --> 00:12:43.042
TALIESIN: Deep in the single digits over here.

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:43.928
LAURA: Ooh.

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:46.433
MARISHA: Deep in the single digits.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.808
LAURA: It's a cleric thing.

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.350
TALIESIN: This is a cleric thing.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.731
TRAVIS: Hey Max, can I get Ashley's iPad?

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.066
MATT: Good call. All righty. 25 to 20?

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.079
MARISHA: 22.

00:12:57.079 --> 00:12:58.425
SAM and LAURA: Ooh!

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:02.347
MATT: Look at you! Did you roll initiative for
Yasha?

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:05.024
TRAVIS: That's 21.

00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:07.449
SAM: We got strength.

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:10.254
LAURA: You got Yasha's tablet?

00:13:10.254 --> 00:13:11.436
TRAVIS: Max is bringing it.

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:12.507
LAURA: Fabulous.

00:13:12.507 --> 00:13:14.085
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.306
TRAVIS: 16.

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:20.490
MATT: 16 for Fjord. 15 to ten?

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:26.232
SAM: 14. Where are you?

00:13:26.232 --> 00:13:27.344
LAURA: Shut up.

00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:28.833
SAM: Where are you?

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.090
LIAM: Shut up.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.694
TRAVIS: Caduceus.

00:13:33.694 --> 00:13:35.898
MATT: All righty. Ten to five?

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.020
LAURA: Seven.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.632
LIAM: Six. Here comes that Slow spell. Fastball
special.

00:13:42.632 --> 00:13:45.343
TALIESIN: The wind-up.

00:13:45.343 --> 00:13:46.954
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:13:46.954 --> 00:13:52.783
MATT: I believe that's all of us. Beginning now
this round of combat; Beau, you have the jump.

00:13:52.783 --> 00:13:56.998
Everyone is prone, by the way. You slid down the
stairs on your ass and impacted with the stone

00:13:56.998 --> 00:14:03.063
floor of this chamber. Nott, what would you like
to-- sorry, Beau is-- sorry. Beau.

00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:06.810
MARISHA: These are lizard people? Or these are
snake people?

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.933
MATT: Yeah, these are--

00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.842
MARISHA: These are the yuan-ti.

00:14:09.842 --> 00:14:14.803
MATT: Yes, these are the yuan-ti. These three
individuals that are mostly humanoid, but bits of

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:19.611
their skin are scaled, their eyes are yellow, you
can see sharpened teeth. This individual here is

00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:23.810
the one with the large hooded snake head that's
still a bit taller than the rest and these long

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.874
lanky arms. Gray skin.

00:14:24.874 --> 00:14:26.538
MARISHA: Do they look super pissed off?

00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:29.231
MATT: They look very unhappy that you've stumbled
into this chamber.

00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.433
MARISHA: Okay. That's all I need to know.

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:36.281
SAM: I'm just going to say this, as players: last
time we encountered a group of people, we killed

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.397
them all. They hadn't done anything to us. I'm
just saying.

00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:42.391
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:46.403
LAURA: These people obviously skin other people
alive, okay? They're bad people.

00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:49.004
TALIESIN: These are Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom villains.

00:14:49.004 --> 00:14:51.174
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to get up.

00:14:51.174 --> 00:14:53.148
SAM: Okay, kill them all.

00:14:53.148 --> 00:14:55.295
MATT: Beau comes to her feet, that's half your
movement.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:15:03.881
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go for that hooded one
if I can. I've got 25. Do I round down, because

00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:05.248
it's 45 halved?

00:15:05.248 --> 00:15:08.410
MATT: It's halved that. Almost all numbers in the
game are rounded down, so to 20.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.944
MARISHA: So 20 "foint?" 20 "foint" of
"movemoint."

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:15.011
LIAM: What just happened?

00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:20.392
MATT: I don't know if you have enough room, or
enough distance, to get over here. You'd have to

00:15:20.392 --> 00:15:23.258
go over. Either way, you're going to take some
attacks of opportunity, so it's up to you.

00:15:23.258 --> 00:15:26.840
MARISHA: Okay, so I'll just go for these two right
there in the corner.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:33.015
MATT: You jump onto your feet and leap up onto the
top, and you're now pincered from both at

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.779
different angles. What are you going to do?

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:40.922
MARISHA: I say: We come in peace-- I can't even.
Then I throw a punch. I'm going to see if I can

00:15:40.922 --> 00:15:42.975
hit the one to my right first.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.064
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:15:45.064 --> 00:15:49.349
MARISHA: That was almost great. 12. Nope, 15.

00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:50.730
MATT: 15 hits.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:58.025
MARISHA: I'm going to punch with my fist. Which is
good. Nine.

00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.627
ALL: <i>Nein</i>!

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:05.390
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point to stun.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.513
MATT: It's nine damage.

00:16:07.513 --> 00:16:09.397
MARISHA: Stunning strike.

00:16:09.397 --> 00:16:13.482
MATT: That's a natural 18 plus zero.

00:16:13.482 --> 00:16:15.100
MARISHA: Bullshit!

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.462
MATT: It does make the save.

00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:17.933
MARISHA: I will punch the other one.

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:19.780
MATT: Go for it.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.145
MARISHA: Sorry, 13.

00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:27.318
MATT: 13 does hit. They're not wearing much in
armor. They're here for ceremonial reasons.

00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:28.396
MARISHA: Eight points of damage.

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:31.067
MATT: Eight points of damage to the other one, so
both been hit.

00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:36.571
SAM: I don't know, sure sounded like we were being
shamed. "They're not wearing any weapons, they're

00:16:36.571 --> 00:16:38.739
"just here for ceremonial reasons."

00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:43.316
MATT: I mean they're not armored; they have
weapons on them. These particular ones, the

00:16:43.316 --> 00:16:49.314
purebloods you see here, as they are called, are
not wearing heavy armor, so they're not too

00:16:49.314 --> 00:16:50.816
difficult to hit.

00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:54.967
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point again and
do flurry of blows.

00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:58.010
MATT: All right, go for it. You got two more
attacks, then.

00:16:58.386 --> 00:17:00.300
MARISHA: Then I'm going to punch each one of them
again.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.948
TRAVIS and MATT: Do it!

00:17:01.948 --> 00:17:06.830
MARISHA: That was almost a natural 20. Did you see
that? 15. That's good. Ten.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.733
MATT: Ten points of damage to the one on the
left.

00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:09.901
LAURA: I like those dice.

00:17:09.901 --> 00:17:13.996
MARISHA: Oh, thank you. I don't remember where
these came from.

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:18.325
MARISHA: The other one was a natural 16. They take
another ten points of damage.

00:17:18.325 --> 00:17:24.135
MATT: Nice! All righty. You went whack, whack!
Manage to hit them both repeatedly in a row. All

00:17:24.135 --> 00:17:30.251
attacks hit. They're both taken aback by the
impact, and then spin to you immediately, their

00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:37.936
tongues out. They're definitely focused on your
presence now.

00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:39.791
MARISHA: Probably should have done Patient
Defense, but I'm done.

00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:41.692
MATT: Now you're done. Yasha's go next.

00:17:41.692 --> 00:17:43.258
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to pop up!

00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:45.232
MATT: All right. Yasha gets to her feet.

00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:49.749
TRAVIS: She's there. Does she have half of her
speed left?

00:17:49.749 --> 00:17:50.523
MATT: Correct.

00:17:50.523 --> 00:17:58.537
TRAVIS: 20 feet. Can she get up onto the platform
opposite of Beau? How much further can she go? Can

00:17:58.537 --> 00:18:01.495
she get to hooded snake, Cobra Kai?

00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:03.742
MATT: Not right now. That path is blocked,
unfortunately.

00:18:03.742 --> 00:18:06.013
LAURA: But she's flanking. She gets advantage on
her attacks.

00:18:06.013 --> 00:18:08.504
TRAVIS: Which one is she flanking? This one in
between Beau and I?

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:09.804
MATT: Yeah, currently.

00:18:09.804 --> 00:18:14.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, with her bonus action she would like
to rage.

00:18:14.723 --> 00:18:19.418
MATT: Yes! The rage kicks in, pulls out her
Magician's Judge sword and--

00:18:19.418 --> 00:18:27.318
TRAVIS: Yeah, with the Magician's Judge, could she
make her first of two attacks against that one

00:18:27.318 --> 00:18:30.249
that she's flanking and could she make them
reckless?

00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:33.164
MATT: Certainly. I mean she's flanked, but she
can.

00:18:33.164 --> 00:18:34.613
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, so it's already there, right?

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.383
MATT: Yeah.

00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:42.764
TRAVIS: I ain't scared, and neither is Yasha.
She'll use Divine Fury if it hits.

00:18:42.764 --> 00:18:45.814
MATT: Roll for the attack with advantage, because
you have her flanked.

00:18:45.814 --> 00:18:48.723
TRAVIS: That's good. 18.

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:51.287
MATT: 18 hits, so damage on that one.

00:18:51.287 --> 00:18:58.967
(music)

00:18:58.987 --> 00:19:02.225
TRAVIS: 12 plus five, 17 on the first one.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:07.056
MATT: Nice! Jumps off of the side, and with the
momentum she leaps onto the platform. She pulls

00:19:07.056 --> 00:19:13.470
her sword out, arcs it past the already punched,
damaged yuan-ti in front. Reacts, looks over the

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.608
shoulder towards you as you go for your second
attack. Same one?

00:19:15.608 --> 00:19:30.349
TRAVIS: Yes, please. Natural 20. With that
barbarian critical! Double the dice. (counting)

00:19:30.349 --> 00:19:33.063
That's 17 points of damage on the second one.

00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:34.468
MATT: 17 points of damage?

00:19:34.468 --> 00:19:35.119
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.552
MATT: Okay, then.

00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:40.307
TRAVIS: Not a lot. They were low.

00:19:40.307 --> 00:19:42.983
MATT: On the same one, right?

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:43.835
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:19:43.835 --> 00:19:47.098
MATT: With the second strike-- the first one
carves past, it hisses at her, Yasha then spins

00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:53.290
the sword around and with one giant snap the head
(plop) and the body falls off to the side of the ground

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.163
and crumbles.

00:19:54.163 --> 00:19:56.158
LAURA: Easy kill, oh no!

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.275
TALIESIN: It means they hurt.

00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:02.850
TRAVIS: Yasha winks at Beau.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.532
MATT: Okay. Rage winks?

00:20:04.532 --> 00:20:06.415
TRAVIS: Yeah. (growls)

00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:08.755
MATT: That finishes Yasha's go.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:18.140
LIAM: Head's off that corpse. You can't put it
back.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.681
TALIESIN: A lot of things. It means that they
could actually do damage to us, possibly. They

00:20:22.792 --> 00:20:24.557
could be glass cannons.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:28.284
LAURA: Oh, right. That's true. We'll find out.

00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:30.230
TALIESIN: We're probably about to find out.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.273
LAURA: He's thinking.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.417
SAM: That one uses her turn to cry.

00:20:34.417 --> 00:20:38.368
LAURA: (fake crying) My sister!

00:20:38.368 --> 00:20:40.279
LIAM: Triplets down to twins.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:50.188
MATT: That one is going to look towards you, Beau,
and in this soft, pinched voice go, "Why don't you

00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:57.569
"just go sit down." Make a wisdom saving throw for
me as this brief sparkle happens in your eyes. You

00:20:57.569 --> 00:21:02.674
feel this wave of arcane influence begin to reach
out towards your mind.

00:21:02.674 --> 00:21:04.634
MARISHA: 18.

00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:08.369
MATT: You blink it off and smile back.

00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:13.436
MARISHA: There's not chairs. What?

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:15.560
SAM: I think they have a lisp.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:26.425
MATT: The other one is going to, moving off to
this end, attempt to pull out a scimitar and aim

00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:30.219
down to strike at an angle towards Nott who's
currently on the ground.

00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:32.163
SAM: I'm just a snake person!

00:21:32.163 --> 00:21:35.367
TRAVIS: I don't know if she was in melee with
Yasha.

00:21:35.367 --> 00:21:37.415
MATT: Yeah, she is. She's within melee.

00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:39.574
TRAVIS: I'll use that sentinel reaction.

00:21:39.574 --> 00:21:41.196
MATT: So she gets an attack.

00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:45.282
TRAVIS: That's reckless. 18.

00:21:45.282 --> 00:21:47.641
MATT: That definitely hits.

00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:50.606
LIAM: You can quit barbarians any time you want.

00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:56.430
TRAVIS: (counting) 15 points of damage.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:02.268
MATT: Nice! Yasha's seeing this one slink by and
swing with the scimitar down towards Nott, who's

00:22:02.348 --> 00:22:06.606
trying to scramble away down on the ground. Yasha
turns around and slams the blade into the back of

00:22:06.606 --> 00:22:10.445
her shoulder, forcing her down. However, the
scimitar is already arcing down towards Nott, with

00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:16.895
advantage because you are on the ground. All
right, a 15 and a 16. I believe that's a total of

00:22:16.895 --> 00:22:17.995
19 to hit?

00:22:17.995 --> 00:22:18.994
SAM: That hits.

00:22:18.994 --> 00:22:22.744
MATT: The strike hits you for seven points of
slashing damage.

00:22:22.744 --> 00:22:27.841
SAM: Uncanny dodge! So what's that, four?

00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:29.930
MATT: Three.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.770
TRAVIS: You look like that two year old that got
into the face paint. "How do I look, daddy?"

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.427
MARISHA: Mom's really expensive makeup.

00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:43.443
TRAVIS: "I'm a ninja turtle!"

00:22:43.443 --> 00:22:45.689
LAURA: Your work was far better than mine.

00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:50.444
TALIESIN: No, I was following your lead.

00:22:53.564 --> 00:23:01.407
MATT: Now the tall lanky gray one begins to take a
step forward and slither around in this direction.

00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:06.958
(slithering)

00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:13.831
TRAVIS: Those sounds are just awful. Oh shit, he
got some movement.

00:23:13.831 --> 00:23:23.096
MATT: 30. Over the top down. The legs as they bend
seem to give in places they shouldn't, with an

00:23:23.096 --> 00:23:27.109
unnatural slithery feel to even just the
footsteps. It's really creepy to watch it move. As

00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:36.807
it spins around, it's going to attempt to take a
bite and scimitar attack, both on Beau with

00:23:36.807 --> 00:23:45.161
advantage because it's flanking with its own
pureblood. That'll be a 24 to hit.

00:23:45.161 --> 00:23:50.430
MARISHA: Uh-huh. He knew. He didn't have to ask.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.243
LIAM: Tell me when the Nein stops screaming,
Clarice.

00:23:54.243 --> 00:24:01.562
MATT: Bite attack, so you take four points of
piercing damage plus nine points of poison damage.

00:24:02.302 --> 00:24:03.338
TRAVIS: <i>Nein.</i> I'll do it.

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:06.787
MATT: As part of its mind fang ability, you're
also going to take some psychic damage.

00:24:06.787 --> 00:24:08.643
TRAVIS: Psychic also?

00:24:08.643 --> 00:24:10.685
MATT: Oh, that's not good.

00:24:10.685 --> 00:24:15.355
(nervous laughter)

00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:17.846
LIAM: Things you never want to hear Matt say

00:24:18.427 --> 00:24:20.140
MATT: 22 points of psychic damage

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.512
MARISHA: Your DM and your doctor. "That's not
good."

00:24:22.512 --> 00:24:29.010
MATT: As the hood opens and the giant fangs extend
and sink into the back of your shoulder, the

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.694
poison hits your system and your brain suddenly
pulses with a sharpening pain. The psychic energy

00:24:33.694 --> 00:24:37.389
courses through the entirety of your
consciousness. For a second, your vision goes

00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:42.934
flash white and blurs. You almost fall to one knee
as the fangs pull out of the wound. At that

00:24:42.934 --> 00:24:45.025
moment, it's going to strike with its scimitar.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.581
LAURA: Oh my god, it gets another? Oh, this guy's
really hard.

00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:49.384
MATT: That's 23 to hit.

00:24:49.384 --> 00:24:51.643
SAM: Oh man. Do some monk shit!

00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:55.747
MARISHA: I should have. I made a wrong call.

00:24:55.747 --> 00:24:57.182
MATT: Seven points of slashing damage.

00:24:57.182 --> 00:24:58.565
MARISHA: Okay. I'm still alive.

00:24:58.565 --> 00:25:00.156
MATT: All right. That's going to end its turn.

00:25:00.156 --> 00:25:02.490
TALIESIN: Are you in the single digits or double?

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.570
MARISHA: Double, but barely.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.532
MATT: All right. That brings us to Fjord's turn.

00:25:09.532 --> 00:25:22.193
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'll pop up. Cool, all right.
Yeah, cool, cool, cool. Okay, hot second. Yeah,

00:25:22.193 --> 00:25:24.888
that changed what I was thinking.

00:25:24.888 --> 00:25:26.768
LAURA: Fjord, don't do it. Stop it.

00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:34.883
TRAVIS: You know what? I don't want to get in
there. Can I just--? Mm, yeah, boy.

00:25:34.883 --> 00:25:40.125
MARISHA: Did we ever do any of that poison resist
stuff? We fell down the stairs, right?

00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:42.788
LAURA: (singing) We didn't do it. We didn't have
time.

00:25:42.788 --> 00:25:48.615
TRAVIS: You know what, where I am, I'm going to
fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast at it and I'm

00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:50.188
going to close--

00:25:50.188 --> 00:25:51.791
MATT: To which one?

00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:54.934
TRAVIS: At Cobra Kai.

00:25:54.934 --> 00:25:56.775
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:12.990
TRAVIS: You know what, with my bonus action-- no,
just Eldritch Blast. 16?

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.172
MATT: That hits.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:16.844
TRAVIS: Ooh, good. Ooh, 15.

00:26:16.844 --> 00:26:18.516
MATT: 15 still hits.

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:32.132
TRAVIS: All right! Oh, it's an eight. 12 points of
damage total.

00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:35.807
SAM: Looking really rough?

00:26:35.807 --> 00:26:43.076
MATT: No. As it pulls back from Beau and swings
with its scimitar, the head curves back and stares

00:26:43.232 --> 00:26:50.115
at you. You can see, against this dark gray, scaly
skin, its very dull, yellow-white eyes immediately

00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:54.458
trace onto you. Is that the end of your turn? Are
you going to move or stay where you're at? You

00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:57.942
have 15 more feet of movement.

00:26:57.942 --> 00:27:00.803
TRAVIS: Can I move along the wall that way?

00:27:00.803 --> 00:27:03.615
MATT: (counting) 15, it's as far as you can get.

00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:05.025
TRAVIS: That'll be fine.

00:27:05.025 --> 00:27:07.227
MATT: That finishes your go, Fjord. Nott, you're
up.

00:27:07.227 --> 00:27:18.157
SAM: (screams) Nott will, from prone, fire a shot
at-- actually, will load a burning bolt-- I have

00:27:18.445 --> 00:27:26.833
one left-- and fire it at snake creature, the
hooded one. Okay. Ooh, yeah, 22.

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:33.352
MATT: That definitely hits. It's sneak attack
because it's adjacent to Beau, plus the additional

00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:35.015
damage from a fire bolt.

00:27:35.015 --> 00:27:49.274
SAM: Ooh, yes. (counting) 26. Plus I'll use Fury
of the Small, why not? 31. Plus the burning bolt,

00:27:49.274 --> 00:27:50.901
what does that do?

00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:55.374
MATT: It should be on your sheet there. I think
it's an additional 1d6 fire damage, if I recall.

00:27:55.374 --> 00:28:01.008
SAM: I didn't write it. Wait, no, it says 1d6 fire
damage. Another two points!

00:28:01.008 --> 00:28:03.667
TRAVIS: Yeah! Metal!

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:09.313
MATT: It hisses as the bolt hits it from the back
of the head, and you can see where it embedded

00:28:09.313 --> 00:28:14.780
itself partially into the skull. It comes up at
top, and part of the bone's piercing up, and the

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:20.123
flames are still burning in the back. It's trying
to reach and pull it out of its own head. All

00:28:20.123 --> 00:28:21.903
right, that's your action.

00:28:21.903 --> 00:28:24.766
LAURA: How did it shoot through the head and it's
still alive?

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:30.530
SAM: It's got that snake hood that's very thin, I
assume. I don't know.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:36.440
MATT: It didn't go all the way through the brain,
it just hooks into it. It did some serious damage still.

00:28:37.018 --> 00:28:41.840
SAM: I don't know how hiding works, but I'm going
to hide. I know that this thing over here will see

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:50.003
me, but can I hide right there, hiding from the
vision of that one? Does that work? Can you hide

00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:51.082
from one person?

00:28:51.082 --> 00:28:53.429
MATT: Well, you're still prone. If you want to get
up, it's half your movement, or you can crawl at

00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:54.306
half speed.

00:28:54.306 --> 00:28:56.339
SAM: I'm going to crawl over there and hide.

00:28:56.339 --> 00:29:00.443
MATT: You crawl over here. You can go there
because you're still in melee with that one, but

00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:02.176
you can attempt to hide from the other if you'd
like.

00:29:02.176 --> 00:29:04.159
SAM: I'm going to hide.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:07.102
TALIESIN: Prone still means you're disadvantage--
no, they have advantage.

00:29:07.102 --> 00:29:10.909
MATT: It's advantage on melee attacks against you,
disadvantage on ranged attacks against you. You

00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:13.945
crawl on the ground around the corner. Roll a
stealth check.

00:29:13.945 --> 00:29:19.816
SAM: 23, but I think because I'm wearing the hood
or whatever--

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:22.171
MATT: Yeah, you always get advantage while you
have that cloak on.

00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:23.751
SAM: Okay, still 23.

00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:30.717
MATT: You believe maybe you've hidden from that
one particular creature. That finishes Nott's go.

00:29:30.717 --> 00:29:37.510
Breaking the silence here, Beau, after you've been
struck by this terrible psychic pain in your face

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:43.160
and the poison courses through your veins, you
look before you and the one yuan-ti pureblood in

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.471
front of you you had already damaged is
(snarling), and it's pulling this crooked dagger

00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:53.551
out of this sheath from the side. Suddenly, in a
flash out of nowhere behind, you see blades go

00:29:53.551 --> 00:30:02.252
(wooshing) and you watch as Avantika, who was
previously invisible still from the spell, appears

00:30:02.252 --> 00:30:05.515
as she does three main strikes from behind.

00:30:05.515 --> 00:30:07.176
TRAVIS: Three?!

00:30:07.176 --> 00:30:14.547
MATT. Two with the rapier. First one hits. Second
one still hits. And the dagger hits. All righty.

00:30:14.547 --> 00:30:22.831
(counting)

00:30:22.831 --> 00:30:24.690
SAM: Ooh! I did my math wrong.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.051
TRAVIS: As soon as you attack, it drops your
invisibility, right?

00:30:27.051 --> 00:30:33.400
MATT: That'll do it. Eviscerates it from behind.
(screeches) Falls to the ground. Avantika is there

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.939
in front of you and flicks both blades off. Some
of the blood (splashing) across the stone on the

00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:47.886
ground. "Don't worry, I've got you," and is going
to use movement to move up this way. Actually, she

00:30:47.886 --> 00:30:52.441
doesn't have enough movement to do that. She can
be right there and gets one more space there. That

00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:54.262
ends Avantika's go.

00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:59.508
SAM: Not that it matters; fury of the small is six
points of damage, so it would have been 34 points

00:30:59.508 --> 00:31:00.374
of damage.

00:31:00.374 --> 00:31:03.324
MATT: One more point. Thank you for the
clarification on your math there, Sam. Jamedi's

00:31:03.883 --> 00:31:05.363
going to get up.

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.838
MARISHA: Mom's Jamedi.

00:31:07.838 --> 00:31:09.149
TRAVIS: First opportunity.

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:16.515
MATT: Makes me sad. Good patience on that one.
Jamedi's going to start taking the bow and huffing

00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:20.645
and running around the way to hide behind this
pillar. Coming that way, is going to attempt to

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:27.776
fire a short bow at the one that's right next to
Yasha. Natural 19, very nice.

00:31:27.776 --> 00:31:30.437
SAM: I'm so excited to find out when he will turn
on us.

00:31:30.437 --> 00:31:34.340
MATT: That is six points of damage to that
yuan-ti, and is going then continue to move--

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.885
actually, no, at that point he couldn't quite get
that far. He would have been right there. Trying

00:31:38.885 --> 00:31:42.168
to move behind, but because he had to get up from
prone, lost half of his movement. That ends his

00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:44.803
go. That brings us to Jester.

00:31:44.803 --> 00:31:46.881
LAURA: I want to stand up!

00:31:46.881 --> 00:31:49.637
MATT: Jester, you stand up.

00:31:49.637 --> 00:31:55.941
LAURA: Then I'm going to cast Hold Person on the
gray guy with the cobra head.

00:31:55.941 --> 00:32:03.201
MATT: On the gray guy? Okay, you release the
spell, and it has no effect. It seems that the

00:32:03.201 --> 00:32:09.754
snakelike form that this creature has mutated into
has gotten so far out of the realm of humanity to

00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:11.301
no longer be considered a person.

00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:12.406
SAM: Ooh.

00:32:12.406 --> 00:32:15.342
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:32:15.342 --> 00:32:18.379
TRAVIS: Hold Monster? Hold Creature?

00:32:18.379 --> 00:32:21.367
LAURA: Yeah, I need Hold Monster. Okay.

00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:22.562
MATT: That's your action.

00:32:22.562 --> 00:32:26.273
LAURA: That's my action. I don't have any spells
for bonus action.

00:32:26.273 --> 00:32:28.446
TRAVIS: Starting to feel less terrible about
killing them.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.583
SAM: Yes.

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:40.204
LAURA: Okay, so I say: Well shit! That's my move.

00:32:40.204 --> 00:32:45.112
MATT: All right. (hisses) towards you, its fangs
bared. That ends your go, Jester. Caleb and

00:32:45.112 --> 00:32:47.846
Caduceus, you guys are up at the same time.

00:32:47.846 --> 00:32:54.827
LIAM: I was rummaging in my pockets for the
molasses, but everybody is dropping, so instead I

00:32:54.827 --> 00:33:01.763
pull out a burned twig and hold my hand out and
cast Witch Bolt at 3rd-level through the twig

00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:03.464
towards snakeman.

00:33:03.464 --> 00:33:06.503
MATT: Ooh! All righty. Roll for attack.

00:33:06.503 --> 00:33:08.336
LIAM: That is a 21.

00:33:08.336 --> 00:33:09.403
MATT: That'll hit.

00:33:09.403 --> 00:33:18.085
LIAM: Okay, so that's 3d12, which I have never
used in my life. I think it's this one. The fuck

00:33:18.085 --> 00:33:30.332
is that?! That's an 11. Plus six is 17. 25
lightning damage.

00:33:30.332 --> 00:33:31.882
MATT: Nice!

00:33:31.882 --> 00:33:38.325
LIAM: Which I did from the ground, I guess, so I
will stand up now. Am I within five feet of that guy?

00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:40.618
MATT: You are, yes.

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:46.330
LIAM: Hey, I'm going to run for it. I'm going to
go toward that pillar there.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.109
MATT: Over here?

00:33:47.109 --> 00:33:47.860
LIAM: Yeah.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:56.972
MATT: (counting) 25. As you rush by, its snake
head cranes around and extends out to bite towards

00:33:56.972 --> 00:33:58.837
the side of your shoulder and arm as you rush
past.

00:33:58.837 --> 00:34:00.802
SAM: No, Caleb, no!

00:34:00.802 --> 00:34:04.359
LIAM: Am I able to use Shield as a reaction if
I've already cast a spell? No, correct? Because

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:06.364
I've not tried to do that, so I don't know if it's
allowed.

00:34:06.364 --> 00:34:11.133
MATT: If it's during your turn, I believe you
cannot because you only cast one spell--

00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:15.649
LIAM: Per round? Because as a rogue, you could do
sneak attack damage and then on an attack of

00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:17.471
opportunity, you could do sneak attack damage.

00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:22.759
MATT: It's different from combat spells versus
casting spells during one turn. I'll have to go

00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:29.510
back and look at that specifically. But for the
time being, no, because there's the one spell per

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:37.756
round limitation during your turn, at least. That
is going to be all together a 17 to hit.

00:34:37.756 --> 00:34:40.184
LIAM: Oh, that hits.

00:34:40.184 --> 00:34:52.850
MATT: With that, the bite strikes out for you.
That is six points of piercing damage, plus seven

00:34:52.850 --> 00:35:00.734
points of poison damage. It's going to use its
secondary mind fangs this round. Similar to Beau,

00:35:00.784 --> 00:35:05.987
your brain suddenly gets spiked with this burst of
terrible wracking pain that emanates into every

00:35:05.987 --> 00:35:11.184
memory of your past life. Like your existence in
one instant is just set on fire and pulled away.

00:35:11.184 --> 00:35:13.845
TRAVIS: Do not get close. If you can help it.

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:17.386
MATT: Oh, that's not too bad! That's 13 points of
psychic damage to you.

00:35:17.386 --> 00:35:18.950
LIAM: Ooh! That's not too bad.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.216
MATT: That ends your turn, then?

00:35:20.216 --> 00:35:22.783
SAM: But you're a wee man.

00:35:22.783 --> 00:35:30.409
MATT: Technically, you would have gotten that far.
That's half-speed. That ends your turn. Caduceus,

00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:31.564
you're up.

00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:34.368
TALIESIN: I'm going to shake it off a little bit.
I'm going to--

00:35:34.368 --> 00:35:36.071
MATT: Stand up?

00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:38.250
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll stand up. I'm going to back
into the corner.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:46.743
MATT: There? You back in towards this cluster of
weird, mossy plant matter that's on the edge.

00:35:46.743 --> 00:35:55.253
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to
just-- No, I'm not going to bother with that for

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:58.071
now. It's not really going to-- If you go down,
you go down at this point.

00:35:58.071 --> 00:36:00.275
TRAVIS: (scoffs)

00:36:00.275 --> 00:36:03.531
TALIESIN: No healing I'm going to do is going to
keep you from going down if you get hit by a

00:36:03.531 --> 00:36:06.000
triple. I can just get you back up.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.190
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.356
SAM: Yeah, but it could prevent-- Okay.

00:36:09.356 --> 00:36:10.848
MATT: Caduceus. What are you doing, buddy?

00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:13.150
TALIESIN: (conflicted stuttering)

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.930
SAM: You're a lost cause, basically.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:22.147
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a-- Where'd it go? These
are cantrips. Healing Word on Beau.

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:24.554
SAM: Oh! You guilted him into healing you.

00:36:24.554 --> 00:36:30.055
TALIESIN: I mean. Eight points of healing.

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:31.435
LAURA: It's something.

00:36:31.435 --> 00:36:33.800
MARISHA: Uh-huh! That's good! Yeah.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.696
MATT: There you go; take your eight points of
healing.

00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:37.004
MARISHA: I'll take it.

00:36:37.004 --> 00:36:46.415
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold the Channel Divinity:
Path to the Grave spell for Yasha.

00:36:46.415 --> 00:36:52.683
MATT: Okay. That ends Caduceus' turn. Beau, you're
up. Yasha's go is when you release?

00:36:52.729 --> 00:36:56.460
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Right as Yasha starts to move,
I'm going to.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.996
TRAVIS: What's that do?

00:36:57.996 --> 00:36:59.745
LAURA: You'll find out, won't you?

00:36:59.745 --> 00:37:03.900
TALIESIN: You don't know. It's going to make Yasha
boss.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:12.866
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around to Cobra Kai. I
want to be like: (slurring) That was mean. Because

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:19.122
I'm still very sick and now I'm poisoned. Then I'm
just going to start fucking blind rage, in my

00:37:19.122 --> 00:37:22.280
slight hallucinatory haze, whaling on her.

00:37:22.302 --> 00:37:23.874
MATT: Okay.

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:31.741
MARISHA: Her. He. Monster. That first one was 21.

00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:33.104
MATT: 21 hits.

00:37:33.104 --> 00:37:40.342
MARISHA: Beautiful. Okay, that's eight damage, and
I want to try Stunning Strike.

00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:41.796
SAM: A what?

00:37:41.796 --> 00:37:42.829
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:47.283
MATT: Stunning Strike on this one? That is a 14
plus one: 15. What's the DC?

00:37:47.283 --> 00:37:49.835
MARISHA: 14.

00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:55.906
MATT: Resists it, unfortunately. There's a
(impact) as you hit. You realize as you're trying

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:59.802
to do Stunning Strike, you don't fully understand
the physicality of it. Its body and organ

00:37:59.802 --> 00:38:04.146
placement is different from the usual, other
human-type creatures you've studied, and so you're

00:38:04.146 --> 00:38:06.701
just unable to hit the right point in its body.

00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:16.513
MARISHA: Okay. Hit it again. That was such
bullshit. 11.

00:38:16.513 --> 00:38:20.129
MATT: In your confusion and frustration of not
being able to find the soft spot in its body, your

00:38:20.129 --> 00:38:22.911
second strike goes and it manages to dodge out of
the way. No impact.

00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:31.690
MARISHA: I just look at it and I just go: I don't
feel very good. Then I'm going to do Patient

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.726
Defense.

00:38:32.726 --> 00:38:35.463
MATT: All right, so then you go in Patient Defense
to protect yourself. Got it.

00:38:35.463 --> 00:38:37.000
MARISHA: I'm a little nauseous.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.595
MATT: That is now Yasha's turn. Before Yasha can
begin the round, Caduceus?

00:38:41.595 --> 00:38:48.671
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Channel Divinity on
the angry snake in armor.

00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:51.729
MATT: Okay. So the next hit against it, it has
vulnerability.

00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:52.692
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:38:52.692 --> 00:38:53.811
MATT: Correct. All right--

00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:54.689
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

00:38:54.689 --> 00:38:55.752
MATT and TALIESIN: You'll find out.

00:38:55.752 --> 00:38:56.910
MATT: What's Yasha doing?

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:02.052
TRAVIS: She's turning around and head-butting the
woman. No, I'm just kidding! Yeah. I'll hop off

00:39:02.052 --> 00:39:06.776
the platform and run towards snake in armor,
right? The one you cast on.

00:39:06.776 --> 00:39:07.741
MATT: Right there?

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:08.486
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:13.198
MATT: As Yasha darts off, the pureblood behind
manages to swipe out with the scimitar. Has an

00:39:13.198 --> 00:39:17.161
attack of opportunity against her. That is going
to be a natural-- They're rolling really good! 17

00:39:17.161 --> 00:39:18.455
plus three. 20.

00:39:18.455 --> 00:39:19.496
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:39:19.496 --> 00:39:24.466
MATT: With that, Yasha suffers seven-- six on the
d6. Seven points of slashing damage, reduced to

00:39:24.466 --> 00:39:25.674
three because she's raging.

00:39:25.674 --> 00:39:26.513
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:39:26.513 --> 00:39:34.135
MATT: Then Yasha shrugs off the impact, rushes
towards the large gray snake entity, and?

00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:35.291
TRAVIS: Reckless attacks.

00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:36.174
MATT: Go for it.

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:42.109
TRAVIS: Oh, that definitely hits. That's a 22?

00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:44.647
MATT: That is correct. Go ahead and roll damage on
that one.

00:39:44.647 --> 00:39:54.371
TRAVIS: 11-- 16 points of damage on the first
one.

00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:57.694
MATT: Okay. 16 points of damage. It is vulnerable
against that. That is technically 32 points of

00:39:57.694 --> 00:40:01.235
damage from that strike. How does Yasha want to do
this?

00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:03.259
LAURA and MARISHA: (cheering)

00:40:03.259 --> 00:40:11.471
TRAVIS: Damn! That's fucking awesome. Yasha goes:
Don't touch her. And just shoves the sword in, and

00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:16.623
then slowly lifts up the snake, just bringing it
up through its ribcage.

00:40:16.623 --> 00:40:22.030
MATT: As the blade impales it, the creature grabs
the blade with both hands and (hisses) as it's

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:26.000
lifted up and begins cursing-- (clapping) Hold on.
Pay attention, guys!

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.141
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:40:27.141 --> 00:40:32.372
MATT: It's okay. As the blade carves through the
stomach of the gray snake man and is lifted off

00:40:32.372 --> 00:40:35.990
the ground (hissing). It begins to curse in
Abyssal as the blade begins to carve up its body,

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.413
until eventually, its hissing turns into a low
gurgle, and then it just slides off the blade, the

00:40:40.413 --> 00:40:43.915
parted half of it splitting into two sides onto
the ground.

00:40:43.915 --> 00:40:46.909
LIAM: Did all Caleb hear with Comprehend Languages
is swear words?

00:40:46.909 --> 00:40:47.880
MATT: Yes.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.752
LIAM: Okay.

00:40:48.752 --> 00:40:53.901
MARISHA: I look at Yasha and I just go: That was
very (vomiting) and I puke a little bit on her.

00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:55.061
MATT: All right.

00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:56.481
SAM: (whispers) Sexy.

00:40:56.481 --> 00:41:03.070
TALIESIN: Hot. I needed that today, thank you.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:16.270
MATT: This one is going to, seeing how everything
is working out-- Yeah. Does not have that ability,

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:24.147
so is instead going to go ahead and (counting) 30.
Then try and dash--

00:41:24.147 --> 00:41:27.762
TALIESIN: That's also a ramp, isn't that harder
terrain to get up there?

00:41:27.762 --> 00:41:34.175
MATT: Oh, no. That's true. Given that circumstance,
there's not much of an escape route for this one.

00:41:34.175 --> 00:41:40.057
LAURA: I would like if she tried to run up the
ramp and just kept sliding down.

00:41:40.057 --> 00:41:42.743
(cartoon running sound effects)

00:41:42.743 --> 00:41:47.076
MATT: Is going to, instead, leap down and attempt
to assail Nott.

00:41:47.076 --> 00:41:48.881
SAM: But I'm hiding!

00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:56.690
MATT: Not against that one, you're not. All right,
so attacks twice with the scimitar. Ooh, natural

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.426
20 on that one and a--

00:41:58.426 --> 00:41:59.455
TALIESIN: Denied.

00:41:59.455 --> 00:42:00.461
SAM: Denied?

00:42:00.461 --> 00:42:05.149
MATT: No, because when you hold your action, you
use your reaction to release it, so you don't have

00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:06.102
a reaction.

00:42:06.102 --> 00:42:08.031
TALIESIN: It uses a reaction for that? That's
bullshit.

00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:17.734
MATT: Sorry, buddy. That's a natural 20 on one
scimitar hit, and a 19 on the other to hit. The

00:42:17.734 --> 00:42:21.182
first one, that's eight plus one. Nine points of
slashing damage on the first hit.

00:42:21.182 --> 00:42:25.851
SAM: Great. I'll take that whatever it's called.

00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:27.011
LAURA: Uncanny Dodge?

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:27.981
SAM: Yeah, thank you.

00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:31.122
MATT: That's four slashing damage, and the second
one is going to be-- Ooh, that's not good. Two

00:42:31.122 --> 00:42:32.467
points of slashing damage.

00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:36.257
SAM: Okay, so that's six total points.

00:42:36.257 --> 00:42:41.188
MATT: Now with all of its allies fallen around and
seeing everyone else standing up, its eyes are

00:42:41.188 --> 00:42:46.023
darting around, looking like it's a caged animal
(snarling and hissing). Its scimitar in front of

00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:50.373
it, it's swinging it wildly in the air and
pointing it towards anything that comes near. That's

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.142
going to end their turn, Fjord, you're up next.

00:42:52.142 --> 00:42:58.362
TRAVIS: Fjord rushes up, summons the blade, and
points it at her, summoning a little eldritch

00:42:58.362 --> 00:43:05.372
energy in his off hand, and says: Drop it. That's
my turn.

00:43:05.372 --> 00:43:06.954
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:43:06.954 --> 00:43:12.422
TRAVIS: Okay. 13.

00:43:12.422 --> 00:43:20.174
MATT: Glaring at you doing that (hostile snarl).

00:43:20.225 --> 00:43:22.407
TRAVIS: No good?

00:43:22.407 --> 00:43:24.176
MATT: Doesn't seem to be fazed, unfortunately.

00:43:24.176 --> 00:43:31.284
TRAVIS: Oh, no! That's Yasha's, that's plus two!
This is plus seven! So (counting) 18!

00:43:31.284 --> 00:43:35.183
MATT: As it snarls at you, you pull the blade a
little closer to the face, up against the chin,

00:43:35.183 --> 00:43:38.655
(resigned snarl) and throws the scimitar to the
side.

00:43:38.655 --> 00:43:41.163
(cheering)

00:43:41.163 --> 00:43:44.644
TRAVIS: Stupid double iPads, fuck! That seems low
for charisma.

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:49.868
MATT: I was surprised, I was like: Okay. That
brings us effectively out of combat.

00:43:49.868 --> 00:43:51.517
LIAM: Slide that a little bit down.

00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:53.171
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:53.171 --> 00:44:02.230
MATT: At this point, you all take stock of your
surroundings. The one standing yuan-ti, the bowls

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:07.083
they were holding and pouring into this fountain
clattered to the ground, the one stands there

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:12.260
before you with your blade held towards their neck
as they're (snarling).

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.324
TRAVIS: Caleb.

00:44:13.324 --> 00:44:14.659
LIAM: Yeah?

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:17.370
TRAVIS: You understand anything coming out of this
thing's mouth?

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.189
LIAM: Not at the moment.

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:22.979
TRAVIS: Oh. Caduceus?

00:44:22.979 --> 00:44:24.179
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:33.312
TRAVIS: What's this one thinking? You do that,
right?

00:44:33.312 --> 00:44:41.104
TALIESIN: I'm very curious to see how this is
going to go. I just want to look her over. What is

00:44:41.104 --> 00:44:46.551
this room? What is happening? What was going on?

00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:55.326
MATT: Well, that would be more generally looking
around you guys. In this chamber, based on the

00:44:55.326 --> 00:45:01.461
little bit of travel you've done from the very top
of this temple, this is the top chamber in the

00:45:01.461 --> 00:45:07.521
pyramid. You're about partway down from where it
is on the surface. It continues down, you imagine,

00:45:07.521 --> 00:45:13.686
based on how large it is in size. This is the
highest part of the pyramid so far. Within this

00:45:13.686 --> 00:45:24.555
chamber, there are clusters of these bits of mossy
plant life that's growing in elements of the

00:45:24.604 --> 00:45:33.263
corners. There is a fountain that sits atop the
central platform in the center of the chamber. The

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:38.996
water itself is slowly trickling off the sides in
small little grooves; it looks to be brackish and

00:45:38.996 --> 00:45:51.145
green. The staircase-- a few minutes pass-- revert
to stairs, so ascension is possible. That's the

00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:55.346
most of what you can make out in the chamber. The
pillars appear to be more load-bearing and

00:45:55.346 --> 00:46:01.265
designed-- as you get a closer look, make a
perception check on this one.

00:46:01.265 --> 00:46:03.190
TALIESIN: 20.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:10.314
MATT: Interesting point. The stonework and
the construct of this entire temple is very old

00:46:10.314 --> 00:46:17.062
and very simple, but you see a lot of intricate
carvings and additional stone that's been added to

00:46:17.062 --> 00:46:26.275
the interior of the chamber that is all carved to
represent snake creatures surmounting, and a great

00:46:26.275 --> 00:46:28.695
snake god. Make a religion check.

00:46:28.695 --> 00:46:30.905
SAM: Oh my gosh. All kinds of checks.

00:46:30.905 --> 00:46:34.935
TALIESIN: 21.

00:46:34.964 --> 00:46:38.424
MATT: A lot of the iconography in
this chamber is directly based on Zehir, the

00:46:38.424 --> 00:46:49.488
Cloaked Serpent, and is imbuing their power into
the snake followers and giving them mutations. You

00:46:49.488 --> 00:46:55.987
can see people going into this metamorphosis and
transforming into a number of the larger snake

00:46:55.987 --> 00:47:00.737
entities you fought or have seen in the city
below. But all that carving is newer. It's

00:47:00.737 --> 00:47:06.592
fresher. It's been placed to cover the older stone
of the temple, and you get the sense that this

00:47:06.592 --> 00:47:12.600
temple was not constructed by these yuan-ti, but
has been since co-opted by them.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:21.154
TALIESIN: Priestess of Zehir, what was this place before you
found it?

00:47:21.154 --> 00:47:38.303
MATT: Looking you over, "It was--" she's speaking in 
Common now. "It was built to a false idol."

00:47:38.303 --> 00:47:44.076
TALIESIN: Do you know its name, or are you 
afraid of it?

00:47:44.076 --> 00:47:49.337
MATT: The eyes turn towards
you, looking up at your large, goofy grin.

00:47:49.337 --> 00:47:52.132
TALIESIN: As I'm large, goofy grin, I'm
going to start touching one of the other

00:47:52.132 --> 00:47:55.674
priestesses and I'm going to start the
process.

00:47:55.674 --> 00:48:03.125
MATT: With that, parts of their wounds
begin to split open wider as you see bits of

00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:08.378
reddish-orange fungus begin to find its way out.
It looks like a sponge emerging from it.

00:48:08.378 --> 00:48:10.934
TALIESIN: Don't mind that.

00:48:10.934 --> 00:48:24.549
MATT: She turns to you and goes, "Are 
you to let me live?"

00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:32.633
TRAVIS: I think that all depends on your
cooperation. We're trying to find our way further

00:48:32.633 --> 00:48:37.940
below. You can either help expedite that or
complicate that.

00:48:37.987 --> 00:48:41.982
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:48:41.982 --> 00:48:49.597
TRAVIS: Yep. Mine, my stats. Woo! 19.

00:48:49.597 --> 00:49:07.454
MATT: Looks towards you, looks towards
Caduceus. Goes, "I will not sully myself before

00:49:07.454 --> 00:49:16.352
"the eyes of my god." In a flash, pulls a dagger
from inside the sash attached to the side and--

00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:23.956
spray, cuts her own throat, scattering across the
front of you, Caduceus, before the body plummets

00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:28.910
back onto the ground with a sick thud on the
stonework and then bleeds out, a small grin

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:33.385
pulling across her sharpened teeth before her eyes
roll back and she expires.

00:49:33.385 --> 00:49:35.000
TALIESIN: Cure Wounds.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.287
LAURA: (gasps) Can you do that?

00:49:37.287 --> 00:49:40.146
TALIESIN: I don't know, can I? Or is it too--?

00:49:40.146 --> 00:49:41.894
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

00:49:41.894 --> 00:49:45.594
TALIESIN: Fair. All right, I was wondering if I 
was pushing this too far.

00:49:45.594 --> 00:49:47.356
LAURA: Cure her before she dies.

00:49:47.356 --> 00:49:51.687
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh man. Dexterity check? Oh no.
Eight.

00:49:51.687 --> 00:49:58.311
MATT: The moment of shock hits you, having
not encountered someone take their life right in

00:49:58.311 --> 00:50:03.399
front of your eyes, and that brief moment of pause
is enough that when you go to try and collect your

00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:07.041
thoughts and cast the spell, the spirit's already
left the body.

00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:09.532
TALIESIN: I obviously do cast the spell, don't I?

00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:10.958
MATT: I would say you go to cast the spell--

00:50:10.958 --> 00:50:11.904
TALIESIN: Can I start?

00:50:11.904 --> 00:50:15.337
MATT: You begin to, and then realize they've
already expired.

00:50:15.337 --> 00:50:17.281
TALIESIN: That's cheating.

00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:19.090
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.402
TRAVIS: They take it pretty seriously around here.

00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:25.501
LAURA: Do you think a lot of gods make people kill
themselves?

00:50:25.501 --> 00:50:26.929
SAM: Are they gone yet?

00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:28.127
TALIESIN: Doesn't seem very helpful.

00:50:28.127 --> 00:50:31.500
SAM: Ah, I was here the whole time!

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.102
TALIESIN: I'm going to start poking around some of
this. Is this attached to the walls?

00:50:35.102 --> 00:50:40.537
LIAM: Wait a moment. Nott, have a look around this
room. Do you see anything problematic?

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:49.147
SAM: Good idea! I'll go check the fountain. What
are these big fancy-- are these doors on the sides?

00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:55.397
MATT: Those are some of the inscripted carvings
that were placed over the existing stonework of

00:50:55.397 --> 00:50:56.629
the chamber.

00:50:56.629 --> 00:50:59.111
LAURA: I'm going to search the body of the beast
guy.

00:50:59.111 --> 00:51:03.274
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check as you're
searching the fountain.

00:51:03.274 --> 00:51:05.423
SAM: 19.

00:51:05.423 --> 00:51:17.309
MATT: That's not too bad. Stepping up onto the
outside of this fountain, it's a two-tiered

00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:26.141
fountain. Along the floor of the fountain basin,
within the water on the base, there are two

00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:35.991
reliefs of snakes coiled, sitting underneath the
water with empty eye sockets. Two of them-- one of

00:51:35.991 --> 00:51:42.944
them has empty eyes, the other one has an empty
eye socket and a dull gray eye that still remains.

00:51:42.944 --> 00:51:49.405
The liquid looks grimy and cloudy.

00:51:49.405 --> 00:51:51.832
SAM: I hate water.

00:51:51.832 --> 00:51:56.571
MATT: You do notice there are, on four edges of
the bottom basin at the lip of the water-- and the

00:51:56.571 --> 00:52:01.389
water meets the very edge-- there are slight
grooves where the water's slowly trickling out and

00:52:01.389 --> 00:52:05.704
down to the floor, and where it hits the floor
there is no pool of water. You inspect closer, and

00:52:05.704 --> 00:52:10.464
there is a hole beneath each groove where the
water itself is pouring through the floor below

00:52:10.464 --> 00:52:12.858
you to what you assume to be a chamber below.

00:52:12.858 --> 00:52:14.435
LAURA: This shit opens up!

00:52:14.435 --> 00:52:20.570
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. Is there anything arcane in nature to
the writing on the sides of it, or can I ascertain

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.751
the purpose of it? This fountain.

00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:31.498
MATT: Make an arcana check to see if you can
ascertain any arcane nature to it.

00:52:31.498 --> 00:52:39.692
MARISHA: While all this is happening, I'm going to
go over to one of those moss clusters and just

00:52:39.692 --> 00:52:43.285
cuddle up with it and sleep. And take a short
rest.

00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:45.628
MATT: You guys are all taking a short rest?

00:52:45.628 --> 00:52:49.574
MARISHA: I don't know. While you guys are doing
this I'm going to be like: Guys, they have

00:52:49.574 --> 00:52:50.663
pillows.

00:52:50.663 --> 00:52:52.720
TALIESIN: I'm going to talk to the moss.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.289
SAM: You're going to what?

00:52:54.289 --> 00:52:58.359
TALIESIN: I'm going to ask the moss to make sure
you have a very comfy sleep, do what they can. You

00:52:58.359 --> 00:53:00.191
guys take care of that one.

00:53:00.191 --> 00:53:01.534
TRAVIS: Is Beau feeling okay?

00:53:01.534 --> 00:53:03.607
TALIESIN: No, Beau is definitely not feeling okay.

00:53:03.607 --> 00:53:07.040
MATT: Beau, you do notice the corner where the
moss is, as you cuddle up to it and glance

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:15.820
forward, there is a six-inch or so diameter hole
in the corner of the wall.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.514
MARISHA: Oh!

00:53:17.514 --> 00:53:19.274
TRAVIS: That's a big glory hole.

00:53:19.274 --> 00:53:24.289
LIAM: There's all kinds of people in this world.

00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:27.696
MATT: Goristro need a way out, too.

00:53:27.696 --> 00:53:32.361
LIAM: Tune into All Work, No Play this Friday!

00:53:32.361 --> 00:53:41.256
MATT: Where the moss is growing, there is a hole
in the stone chamber about that big around that

00:53:41.256 --> 00:53:44.369
looks to be a tunnel or tube that slowly descends
downward.

00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:47.445
SAM: Trash chute.

00:53:47.445 --> 00:53:55.668
MATT: Upon glancing at it, the interior is somewhat damp
with condensation and that's where a lot of this

00:53:55.668 --> 00:54:03.077
moss is gathering around the outskirts of it. You
also notice scales, little clusters of scales that

00:54:03.077 --> 00:54:05.407
are gathered on the edges of the stone.

00:54:05.407 --> 00:54:07.543
LAURA: Ooh, snakes come in and out of here!

00:54:07.543 --> 00:54:11.586
TRAVIS: Directly above the fountain there's a
ceiling, I take it, yes?

00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:13.285
MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.

00:54:13.285 --> 00:54:14.818
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.783
LAURA: Did I find anything on that snake guy?

00:54:16.783 --> 00:54:18.187
TRAVIS: 16.

00:54:18.187 --> 00:54:25.591
MATT: You glance up on the ceiling and you can see
two grooves-- well, not two grooves, but two holes

00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:30.700
that are in the stonework above. Bits of the stone
have fallen and cracked a little. Where those two

00:54:30.766 --> 00:54:36.314
holes are, glancing directly below them looking
up, you can see the faint pinhole bits of light

00:54:36.314 --> 00:54:42.367
from the sky above. You also see the stone right
around those holes is faintly stained crimson.

00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:45.139
TRAVIS: Directly above the fountain.

00:54:45.139 --> 00:54:49.892
SAM: That was the sacrifice tablet on top.

00:54:49.892 --> 00:54:51.563
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:54:51.563 --> 00:54:56.291
SAM: Oh, that's why it's all grimy. It's blood
water. Ugh!

00:54:56.291 --> 00:55:01.958
TALIESIN: Is there sign of blood in or around the
fountain or in any of the grooves? I'm seeing if

00:55:02.004 --> 00:55:04.139
the blood makes it all the way down here.

00:55:04.139 --> 00:55:08.101
MATT: Make a medicine check.

00:55:08.101 --> 00:55:15.998
TALIESIN: That's 21.

00:55:15.998 --> 00:55:22.493
MATT: With your experience with blood and the
viscosity of it, you gather that if any of it were

00:55:22.493 --> 00:55:28.581
to find its way into the fountain, either it's not human
crimson color enough. You don't see any signs of

00:55:28.581 --> 00:55:34.137
it currently in here. Most of the water that's in
this fountain right now seems to be just water and

00:55:34.137 --> 00:55:37.807
algae and grime that has built up within the
fountain.

00:55:37.807 --> 00:55:44.683
SAM: Does it look like those vacuous eye holes in
the snakes are about the same size as those rubies

00:55:44.683 --> 00:55:45.906
that I had found?

00:55:45.906 --> 00:55:47.922
MATT: Approximately.

00:55:47.922 --> 00:55:50.751
SAM: Can I just--

00:55:50.751 --> 00:55:51.864
LAURA: Wait!

00:55:51.864 --> 00:56:00.803
SAM: --look for traps? Can I just look for traps
around the fountain without touching the water?

00:56:00.803 --> 00:56:02.471
MATT: Sure. Make an investigation check.

00:56:02.471 --> 00:56:04.220
LAURA: Can I search the cobra head?

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.325
SAM: 11.

00:56:05.325 --> 00:56:10.495
MATT: Yes. You inspect the body of the now
slaughtered cobra figure. It is nude. There's no

00:56:10.495 --> 00:56:14.206
clothing on it; it is a scaled flesh body.

00:56:14.206 --> 00:56:15.635
LAURA: Aw, I thought it had armor on it!

00:56:15.635 --> 00:56:25.423
MATT: No, no armor, it is just a lanky, heavily
scale-armored snake creature. There's nothing to

00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:27.660
pull off of its body, unfortunately.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.335
LAURA: Oh! Try to get some of the poison off its
fangs because it's poisonous!

00:56:31.335 --> 00:56:32.837
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, in a vial.

00:56:32.837 --> 00:56:33.735
SAM: Me?

00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:36.592
LAURA: Yeah, don't you like doing things with
chemicals?

00:56:36.592 --> 00:56:40.142
SAM: Sure, I can, but that seems like more of a
medical thing.

00:56:40.142 --> 00:56:43.744
LAURA: I'm going to try to get the poison off of
it. Off the fangs.

00:56:43.744 --> 00:56:49.241
MATT: Okay. Do you have the materials to do so?

00:56:49.241 --> 00:56:50.780
LAURA: I've got a vial.

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.344
SAM: Do you have a medical kit?

00:56:53.344 --> 00:56:56.852
MATT: Have you ever milked a dead snake for its
venom?

00:56:56.852 --> 00:57:00.260
LAURA: I haven't milked this kind of-- no, I
haven't milked a snake.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.797
MATT: Make a nature check for me.

00:57:03.797 --> 00:57:08.367
LAURA: 15!

00:57:08.367 --> 00:57:13.883
MATT: Okay, you'll spend the next 15 or 20 minutes
or so attempting to do this and I'll come to you

00:57:13.883 --> 00:57:16.600
in a minute with your success and/or failure.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:22.181
TALIESIN: Anywhere where there's moss, am I
finding these matching holes?

00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:27.113
MATT: You go around finding each of these patches?
Yes, there are. At each corner of the chamber

00:57:27.113 --> 00:57:32.232
there are these patches, and at each corner you do
see one of these holes. Make a perception check.

00:57:32.232 --> 00:57:36.784
TALIESIN: Ugh. Ten.

00:57:36.784 --> 00:57:42.657
MATT: All you can tell is that you do see the
errant scale. They're big scales, they're not

00:57:42.657 --> 00:57:48.876
tiny. You see bits of snake skin and larger chunks
of scales that have rubbed off from something

00:57:48.876 --> 00:57:50.378
moving through that chamber.

00:57:50.378 --> 00:57:52.493
TRAVIS: You said six inches in diameter?

00:57:52.493 --> 00:57:55.918
MATT: Yeah, from side to side diameter.

00:57:55.918 --> 00:57:57.520
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what I meant. Sorry.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.106
TALIESIN: I'm thinking about plugging these holes.

00:58:00.106 --> 00:58:01.811
LAURA: That'd be smart.

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.730
LIAM: What holes?

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:12.632
MARISHA: You hear me in the corner go, hoo. Hoo.
Does it echo?

00:58:12.632 --> 00:58:14.575
TALIESIN: Don't do that!

00:58:14.575 --> 00:58:16.032
MATT: Oh, through the hole? Okay.

00:58:16.032 --> 00:58:18.808
TRAVIS: She's all fucking sick and fucked up.

00:58:18.808 --> 00:58:20.006
MARISHA: Yeah, hoo!

00:58:20.006 --> 00:58:24.128
MATT: It does echo slightly down and you hear it
reverberate. It does continue downward.

00:58:24.128 --> 00:58:28.516
LIAM: What are you doing over there? I walk over
and I nudge her thigh and butt with my foot. What

00:58:28.516 --> 00:58:30.045
are you doing shouting in holes?

00:58:30.045 --> 00:58:31.485
MARISHA: I found a sing-songy tube.

00:58:31.485 --> 00:58:33.286
LIAM: I don't think that is what that is.

00:58:33.286 --> 00:58:36.069
MATT: Nott, what were you doing?

00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:38.585
SAM: I was looking for traps, I don't think I
found it with an 11.

00:58:38.585 --> 00:58:40.298
MATT: With an 11, it does not appear to be
trapped.

00:58:40.298 --> 00:58:44.098
TRAVIS: On the wall where the carvings look like
they've carved over something, are there any areas

00:58:44.098 --> 00:58:48.970
that aren't done as carefully and you can see what
was there before it was carved over?

00:58:48.970 --> 00:59:01.745
MATT: Whatever stone has been placed has been
cemented in with all sorts of adhesive and basic

00:59:01.745 --> 00:59:06.616
masonry materials. It was designed to permanently
cover what was there previously.

00:59:06.616 --> 00:59:08.496
TALIESIN: How many points down are you right now?

00:59:08.496 --> 00:59:09.718
LAURA: A lot, huh?

00:59:09.718 --> 00:59:10.716
SAM: Most of them?

00:59:10.716 --> 00:59:13.113
MARISHA: Yeah, most of them. I have 20 hit points
total right now.

00:59:13.113 --> 00:59:14.301
LAURA: I can do it.

00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:15.755
TALIESIN: We can both use--

00:59:15.755 --> 00:59:18.360
MARISHA: Am I resting long enough where I can put
on a few hit points?

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.274
MATT: If you guys want to take a short rest, you
can do it. At the moment, it does not appear that

00:59:20.274 --> 00:59:25.058
there's any immediate danger. The door locked
above you and you don't hear any more scuffling

00:59:25.058 --> 00:59:26.232
from above.

00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:27.367
LIAM: Nobody noticed.

00:59:27.367 --> 00:59:29.040
SAM: Caleb is way worse than her.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.092
TRAVIS: Yeah, 11.

00:59:30.092 --> 00:59:34.999
MARISHA: Let's take a short rest, for sure, that's
what that means.

00:59:34.999 --> 00:59:38.073
SAM: Are we plugging up the holes first or are we
just watching them?

00:59:38.073 --> 00:59:45.083
LIAM: It's a simple thing, if we have any kind of
wood or maybe some silver or copper coins to shove in?

00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:48.716
LAURA: Oh, these big giant pieces of wood that we
carry around with us all the time?

00:59:48.716 --> 00:59:53.760
LIAM: Like arrow and crossbow bolts and things
like that, use your noggin. Or some coins and I

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.887
could turn them to stone and block up the holes.

00:59:55.887 --> 00:59:58.619
LAURA: Coins, though? We would make them--

00:59:58.619 --> 00:59:59.658
LIAM: Copper?

00:59:59.658 --> 01:00:00.860
TALIESIN: Wait, what can you turn into stone?

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:06.251
SAM: He's excellent! He can make one thing into
another. We used to have this trick where we would

01:00:06.376 --> 01:00:11.890
sell people a magical box that could turn a copper
into a silver.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.168
LAURA: You motherfucker, that was me!

01:00:14.168 --> 01:00:16.091
SAM: Ooh. Did we use that one on you?

01:00:16.091 --> 01:00:21.657
LAURA: What if we get the weapons off the
priestesses and put them in the holes?

01:00:21.657 --> 01:00:23.829
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.360
LAURA: Then you could do that?

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.410
LIAM: It would be stone swords I would imagine, I
don't know. We could shove as many--

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.305
LAURA: It would keep them from coming up through
it as long as it was blocking, yes?

01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:37.593
MATT: Are you talking about the holes in the
corner?

01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:39.063
They are about that big around, just so you
know.

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:40.865
LAURA: Yeah, so we could shove a sword in there,
yeah?

01:00:40.865 --> 01:00:44.774
MATT: Yeah, you could put a sword in there. It
would be sitting on the ground and blocking the

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.780
space a bit.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.745
LIAM: I was thinking of jamming it full of a
material so it's like a clot and then turning that

01:00:50.745 --> 01:00:52.407
into stone.

01:00:52.407 --> 01:01:00.505
TALIESIN: We could do that with-- we have-- it's a
little morose, but we've got some dead people.

01:01:00.505 --> 01:01:02.871
LIAM: I can't do that to dead people.

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:07.517
SAM: Why don't we just shove the dead people in
there, and then if we see the dead people moving

01:01:07.517 --> 01:01:10.761
we'll all draw our weapons and attack whatever
comes out.

01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:12.892
LAURA: This is so fucked up. I'm into it.

01:01:12.892 --> 01:01:17.500
SAM: Take some legs and arms and just shove them
in the holes.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.242
MATT: You're taking the corpses and filling--

01:01:21.242 --> 01:01:22.475
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

01:01:22.475 --> 01:01:23.801
MATT: Okay.

01:01:23.801 --> 01:01:26.606
LIAM: You know, that's not a bad idea because I
could burn the flesh and it would fuse.

01:01:26.606 --> 01:01:27.483
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.719
LAURA: Oh god.

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:31.285
SAM: We need to chop-- Yasha, chop off all their
arms.

01:01:31.285 --> 01:01:33.936
TRAVIS: (as Yasha) No.

01:01:33.936 --> 01:01:37.583
SAM: Jester, chop off all their arms.

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:41.724
LAURA: Well, how about I just drag the bodies
over. I start dragging the body over and shoving

01:01:41.724 --> 01:01:43.743
an arm in the hole.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:44.854
MATT: Okay.

01:01:44.854 --> 01:01:46.621
LAURA: I'm pushing them.

01:01:46.621 --> 01:01:49.114
MATT: To which one, one of the purebloods?

01:01:49.114 --> 01:01:50.394
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:50.394 --> 01:01:52.178
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:01:52.178 --> 01:01:53.384
LAURA: Oh no.

01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:56.745
SAM: Nice.

01:01:56.745 --> 01:01:58.662
LAURA: 20.

01:01:58.662 --> 01:02:06.010
MATT: Okay. As you're dragging it over, you do see
a bit of metal jewelry fall out from underneath

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:07.131
the robe.

01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:07.893
LAURA: Yoink!

01:02:07.893 --> 01:02:11.943
MATT: It is an intricate stone key that is on a
metal chain.

01:02:11.943 --> 01:02:15.046
LAURA: We should get these of the other ladies.

01:02:15.046 --> 01:02:18.541
TALIESIN: Let's definitely check those bodies.

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:20.127
TRAVIS: We check the other bodies.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:21.950
MATT: Investigation check.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:24.119
TALIESIN: You can take it.

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:31.774
TRAVIS: That's not bad. I think I made one this
campaign. Natural 20.

01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:38.590
MATT: Across the other two bodies, you find that
was the only key. You do find amongst the two of

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:47.908
them some errant pieces of jewelry. You find a
nice gold ring. You're not quite sure how much

01:02:47.927 --> 01:02:54.158
it's worth, but it looks probably worth something.
You find two jeweled daggers, ceremonial, that

01:02:54.158 --> 01:03:00.520
they had kept sheathed or one of them had brought
out earlier. That's what you find on their bodies.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.049
TRAVIS: The gold ring have any sort of symbol on
it? Symbol of the snake?

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:12.286
MATT: Both of these blades have very simple,
snake-like iconography. Where the pommel is, it

01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:16.244
looks like the snout of a snake mouth.

01:03:16.244 --> 01:03:17.621
TRAVIS: The ring have anything on it?

01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:19.118
MATT: The ring? No, the ring is a simple gold
ring.

01:03:19.118 --> 01:03:20.712
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:20.712 --> 01:03:23.811
LAURA: You should put it in the fire and see if it
shows words.

01:03:23.811 --> 01:03:26.482
TRAVIS and LAURA: What?

01:03:26.482 --> 01:03:27.544
TRAVIS: Hey, Caleb.

01:03:27.544 --> 01:03:28.180
LIAM: Yeah?

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.622
TRAVIS: I'll flip the gold ring over towards
Caleb. I don't know if that does anything, but it

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:35.099
was on the lady.

01:03:35.099 --> 01:03:38.972
LIAM: Well, I could definitely inspect this. Do
you want me to do that now, though, or maybe we

01:03:38.972 --> 01:03:40.384
are pressed for time?

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:42.056
LAURA: We're taking a short rest, remember?

01:03:42.056 --> 01:03:43.132
LIAM: We're hanging here?

01:03:43.132 --> 01:03:44.125
MARISHA: How much time do we have left?

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:44.993
LIAM: Because I'm pretty beat up.

01:03:44.993 --> 01:03:48.056
MATT: Well, for you it's taken the full hour. If
everyone's taking a short rest, it's a full hour

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:49.228
of rest.

01:03:49.228 --> 01:03:51.441
LAURA: So that you can heal.

01:03:51.441 --> 01:04:02.566
MARISHA: I spent four hit dice, I'm up to 42
points. Does my malaria that I've come down with change?

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:11.859
MATT: No. While you're all resting, too, Jamedi is
carefully looking through the different holes in

01:04:11.859 --> 01:04:16.597
the side of the chambers and helping you plug them
with some of the dead bodies. As you push them in,

01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:27.121
Avantika saunters up to you, Fjord, and says, "So.
How long has it been for you, eh?"

01:04:27.121 --> 01:04:31.312
TRAVIS: How long has it been for--

01:04:31.312 --> 01:04:34.027
MATT: "Since you've been called."

01:04:34.027 --> 01:04:41.326
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh! Are people listening or are we by
ourselves?

01:04:41.459 --> 01:04:46.111
MATT: We'll say, for this purpose, you guys are
out of earshot of most of the group.

01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:53.498
TRAVIS: Actually, that night after our convo, I
had another dream.

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:57.541
MATT: "Then it was destiny. What happened? Tell me
everything."

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:05.958
TRAVIS: I found myself under the ocean and then I
saw these visions of people that I knew in my

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:10.499
life: some that had wronged me, some that were
very dear to me. I had to force my way through

01:05:10.499 --> 01:05:20.411
them up this staircase and when I reached the
top-- Have you ever heard the word "reward"?

01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:26.327
MATT: "I am familiar with this promise, aye."

01:05:26.327 --> 01:05:35.985
TRAVIS: It was astounding. Incredible. Hard to
believe. It was almost as if the oceans obeyed my

01:05:35.985 --> 01:05:38.801
commands?

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:43.185
MATT: Glancing at her expression, she's enthralled
and there's a moment where her head turns and you

01:05:43.185 --> 01:05:50.818
see a flash of jealousy in her eyes, and then it
reverts back and she goes, "That sounds incredible."

01:05:50.912 --> 01:05:55.510
TRAVIS: How long has it been for you?

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:59.648
MATT: "A few years, about."

01:06:04.938 --> 01:06:09.795
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, beginner's luck, right?

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.689
MATT: "Apparently." Her eyes are still locked on
yours and she leans forward and takes her fingers

01:06:15.689 --> 01:06:20.110
and puts them through the side of your hair and
goes, "I can trust you, right?"

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:24.076
TRAVIS: Of course.

01:06:24.076 --> 01:06:26.197
MATT: "And you trust these people?"

01:06:26.197 --> 01:06:29.570
TRAVIS: With my life.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:35.239
MATT: "Good. Good." She puts her fingers the rest
of the way through your hair, through the back of

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:39.599
your head, pulls you close and headbutts you a
little bit and lets you go, and gets up and walks off.

01:06:39.732 --> 01:06:42.067
LIAM: (whispering) You're a dead man.

01:06:42.067 --> 01:06:44.700
TALIESIN: (whispering) Seven days.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.471
TRAVIS: Anybody looking at us as I turn around?

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.584
MATT: Jester.

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:53.738
TRAVIS: (pained) Ah, ah!

01:06:53.738 --> 01:07:01.105
MATT: Your short rest comes to a close. You've
used your hit dice, you've healed up a bit, you've

01:07:01.105 --> 01:07:03.143
gotten your arcane--

01:07:03.143 --> 01:07:04.450
LIAM: Arcane recovery.

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.041
MATT: Cool. What would you guys like to do?

01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:12.041
TALIESIN: I would love to take a last look at the
snake iconography and the bits that have been

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:17.841
added to see how well-- I don't want to fudge them
or anything, but where's there a keyhole? Are

01:07:17.841 --> 01:07:20.942
these things attached to the wall? What's the
deal?

01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:22.265
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:07:22.265 --> 01:07:27.108
TALIESIN: Oh man, it would be. Eight.

01:07:27.108 --> 01:07:32.058
MATT: Best you can tell, they were carved onto a
separate piece of stone that has since been

01:07:32.058 --> 01:07:38.345
affixed to the previous backing of this chamber.
It's been that way across most of the walls here.

01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:41.280
LAURA: You want me to try to pull it away?

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.373
TALIESIN: I'm worried about what that might do. I
don't know. This is obviously an older temple than

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:53.938
they're giving it credit for, which means there's
probably things here that are older than snakes.

01:07:53.938 --> 01:07:57.465
MARISHA: Hey, Cad, you know ghosts, right?

01:07:57.465 --> 01:07:59.132
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:07:59.132 --> 01:08:06.930
MARISHA: Deep down inside, don't ghosts get mad
when you build temples on top of their temples?

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.815
TALIESIN: I don't know. I've never tried.

01:08:08.815 --> 01:08:11.130
MARISHA: Like graves on top of graves. Doesn't
that make--?

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.399
TALIESIN: No, it's perfectly fine to stack graves.
It's actually very efficient. It's a great way of

01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:18.810
using if you have a limited amount of space. Over
time, you eventually end up doing that. That's

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.115
common practice.

01:08:21.115 --> 01:08:23.041
MARISHA: My parents fucking lied to me.

01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:25.971
TALIESIN: Yeah, apparently they do that.

01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:30.824
MARISHA: (trilling) I'm still echoing.

01:08:30.824 --> 01:08:32.967
MATT: You're shouting into a dead body stuffed
into a hole?

01:08:32.967 --> 01:08:33.970
MARISHA: Oh.

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.104
TRAVIS: Dead armpit.

01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:41.097
TALIESIN: Can we understand any of these glyphs?
Is there anything that--

01:08:41.097 --> 01:08:46.209
LIAM: I have looked all around the fountain and
I'm not able to make anything out.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:53.902
MATT: You don't see any language carved in here.
It's mostly visuals of Zehir the Cloaked Serpent,

01:08:53.902 --> 01:08:59.575
bestowing the blessing and mutating followers that
are rising up. His army of snake people.

01:08:59.575 --> 01:09:05.595
LIAM: Are they any seams or visible machinery or
cogs or anything?

01:09:05.595 --> 01:09:09.818
MATT: There are the holes in the ground at the
base of the fountain where the waters is actually

01:09:09.818 --> 01:09:16.709
trickling through to something beneath. There's
the curled snakes that are in the water below.

01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:19.282
Those are the only things that you've noticed
around the fountain.

01:09:19.282 --> 01:09:22.336
TALIESIN: I don't think we want the water to go
into the ground.

01:09:22.336 --> 01:09:29.188
LAURA: Can I try looking at Beau? Check her out
and see if I can see what's wrong with her?

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.876
MATT: Make a medicine check.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:33.791
TRAVIS: Maybe she's thirsty. Give her some water
from the fountain.

01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:35.497
LAURA: That's good.

01:09:35.497 --> 01:09:36.843
SAM: Look at you, Mrs. Medicine.

01:09:36.843 --> 01:09:38.799
LAURA: 24.

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:48.735
MATT: Nice. Looking her over, you can see the dark
circles under the eyes, the continuous sweating

01:09:48.735 --> 01:09:52.138
along the brow and the shoulders and the chest
area.

01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:54.253
LAURA: Ooh, you're like The Gentleman.

01:09:54.253 --> 01:10:01.955
MATT: The pupils are slightly dilated and the
breathing is more shallow than normal.

01:10:01.955 --> 01:10:05.231
LAURA: Your breathing is more shallow than normal.

01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:12.384
MATT: Definitely warmer to the touch than a
healthy person would be. There's some sort of a

01:10:12.384 --> 01:10:17.975
disease that's working her way through her system.
You don't have a whole bunch of book experience

01:10:18.116 --> 01:10:23.771
with disease necessarily, but you get the sense
that this might have been transmitted by some of

01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:29.072
the insects that you encountered on the island on
your way in. It's some sort of disease transmitted

01:10:29.072 --> 01:10:31.232
by them through bites.

01:10:31.232 --> 01:10:38.406
LAURA: And Lesser Restoration says it can cure one
disease, but it's not that kind of disease?

01:10:38.406 --> 01:10:42.565
TALIESIN: I already tried and it didn't happen.

01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:44.486
SAM: Maybe it's a magic disease.

01:10:44.486 --> 01:10:46.286
TALIESIN: Or it's just mean.

01:10:46.286 --> 01:10:49.095
SAM: Maybe she's got two diseases.

01:10:49.095 --> 01:10:51.609
LIAM: Maybe Matt forgot the quality of Lesser
Restoration?

01:10:51.609 --> 01:10:55.007
MATT: That's true. It says condition be blinded,
deafened, paralyzed or poisoned, and then above it

01:10:55.007 --> 01:10:57.603
says diseased, and I did not read that part
earlier.

01:10:57.603 --> 01:11:00.257
TALIESIN: I just suck as a healer.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:10.277
MATT: As part of my own mistake here, we'll say
that this is where you come through with your

01:11:10.277 --> 01:11:14.519
casting of Lesser Restoration before.

01:11:14.519 --> 01:11:17.089
MARISHA: It's a time release capsule.

01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:20.947
MATT: Yeah. Exactly. It takes a while for it to
work its way through the system.

01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:24.848
TALIESIN: Did you take it with food or did you
just put it in your system?

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:26.646
MARISHA: I take it with booze.

01:11:26.646 --> 01:11:30.529
LAURA: Did you eat it or did you put it up your
butt, because it depends.

01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:34.406
LIAM: That's the fastest way. Up your butt.

01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:37.094
MATT: That's what I get for fast reading. Going,
"Oh well, it doesn't list that among the

01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:39.004
"conditions" but disease is not a condition. That's
my fault.

01:11:39.143 --> 01:11:45.292
SAM: As we're mounting up or getting ready to do
something, I'm going to go over to Jamedi Cosko

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:50.214
and just say: Hey, Jamedi.

01:11:50.214 --> 01:11:52.239
MATT: He's sitting there.

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:53.749
SAM: Wow, that was a tough battle.

01:11:53.749 --> 01:11:56.967
MATT: He's inspecting the side of the walls and
the carvings.

01:11:56.967 --> 01:12:00.477
SAM: Oof, I need a drink. Do you want one?

01:12:00.477 --> 01:12:03.614
MATT: "I am okay, but I appreciate the offer."

01:12:03.614 --> 01:12:08.588
SAM: You do drink liquids, don't you?

01:12:08.588 --> 01:12:11.236
MATT: "I do on occasion, yes."

01:12:11.236 --> 01:12:15.558
SAM: Well then, why wouldn't you want a nice
little nip of something?

01:12:15.558 --> 01:12:17.845
MATT: He turns back towards you with a curious
glance and says--

01:12:17.845 --> 01:12:19.615
SAM: It's really good.

01:12:19.615 --> 01:12:21.740
MATT: "I'm sober."

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:30.755
SAM: I have some jerky. Do you want a little
nibble? You do eat food, don't you?

01:12:30.755 --> 01:12:36.477
MATT: His eyes narrow. "Yes, I would love some
jerky."

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:40.453
SAM: Here.

01:12:40.453 --> 01:12:44.854
TRAVIS: Coveted jerky.

01:12:45.559 --> 01:12:52.435
MATT: He takes it from you. "I appreciate the
offer." He eats and continues to look over--

01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:53.742
SAM: Is he swallowing?

01:12:53.742 --> 01:12:55.485
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:12:57.251 --> 01:12:58.475
SAM: Ten.

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:05.734
MATT: Looks like it. You see him chewing. Chewing.
A little swallow. Chew chew chew.

01:13:05.734 --> 01:13:07.259
LAURA: Chewsy chews.

01:13:07.259 --> 01:13:08.631
MATT: Chewsing.

01:13:08.631 --> 01:13:11.206
SAM: All right.

01:13:11.206 --> 01:13:15.725
LAURA: Can I take the tip of one of my
paintbrushes and stick it in the holes in the

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.048
ground and swirl it around?

01:13:18.048 --> 01:13:19.735
SAM: He's not a zombie.

01:13:19.735 --> 01:13:22.614
MATT: Sure. You take your paintbrush and as you
put it in there-- because there is the groove on

01:13:22.614 --> 01:13:26.202
the side of the fountain and it meets with the
hole in the ground, so the water is going through

01:13:26.202 --> 01:13:30.864
the hole below. You stick your paintbrush in it
and it mixes with the paintbrush. It's thicker

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:37.211
than water, barely. It's faintly viscous and where
the groove is you can see the greenish slick where

01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:43.361
slime and general algae buildup has caused it to
discolor against the rest of the stone. It builds

01:13:43.361 --> 01:13:46.973
up a bit and you pull the paintbrush out and it
continues down into the chamber below.

01:13:46.973 --> 01:13:48.413
LAURA: Look at that.

01:13:48.413 --> 01:13:49.614
TALIESIN: That's a very nice paintbrush.

01:13:49.614 --> 01:13:52.479
LAURA: No, look at the weird algae shit on my
paintbrush now.

01:13:52.479 --> 01:13:56.469
TALIESIN: It doesn't look weird. It's just algae,
right?

01:13:56.469 --> 01:14:03.472
MATT: It smells like a typical type of algae,
though the liquid itself has a somewhat acrid

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:05.379
smell to it.

01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:09.576
LIAM: Caleb looks around at everyone doing
absolutely nothing and sits down, pulls out his

01:14:09.576 --> 01:14:12.603
book, and starts to Identify this ring to see if
anything's happening.

01:14:12.603 --> 01:14:20.954
TALIESIN: Does this seem like the stuff that's in
these people? I've seen several heads come off and

01:14:20.954 --> 01:14:23.195
I've got samples of it available to me.

01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:27.611
MATT: No, the blood of the yuan-ti that you've
seen as it scatters is a deep purple in color.

01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:30.831
TALIESIN: Including the crazy dude? The one that
was super--

01:14:30.831 --> 01:14:31.994
MATT: Correct.

01:14:31.994 --> 01:14:33.570
TALIESIN: And this is not that?

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.509
MATT: Correct.

01:14:34.509 --> 01:14:37.579
LAURA: Did I get any poison?

01:14:37.579 --> 01:14:42.202
MATT: Oh yeah, that's right. You did not,
unfortunately. As you try and sit there holding

01:14:42.202 --> 01:14:48.714
the head over a jar and jamming the fang into the
thing, this awkward process, you don't get much

01:14:48.714 --> 01:14:50.122
out of it, unfortunately.

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:51.693
TALIESIN: So we're looking for a keyhole.

01:14:51.693 --> 01:14:54.601
MARISHA: I'll search for a keyhole while we're at
it.

01:14:54.601 --> 01:14:56.576
LAURA: You should stick the rubies in those
eyeballs!

01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:58.132
SAM: Is it time?

01:14:58.132 --> 01:15:00.878
MATT: I will say you do recall as when you entered
the temple, now that you're thinking about it,

01:15:00.878 --> 01:15:06.865
that the door that locked behind you above you,
the trap door, it had a small opening where a--

01:15:06.865 --> 01:15:09.913
LAURA: That's how we get out. Good to know.

01:15:09.913 --> 01:15:11.810
MARISHA: Maybe it's a skeleton key.

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:13.122
SAM: It's time?

01:15:13.122 --> 01:15:14.594
LAURA: Wait!

01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.834
LIAM: Five more minutes, please!

01:15:16.834 --> 01:15:24.760
MATT: You complete your ritual. The ring is not
magical, but it is worth a fair amount of gold.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.507
TALIESIN: Let's assume that bad things are going
to come out of these holes at some point.

01:15:29.507 --> 01:15:33.949
LAURA: Can I swirl my paintbrush in the water in
the fountain and see if it does anything?

01:15:33.949 --> 01:15:38.949
MATT: You swirl the paintbrush in the fountain for
a bit. It collects some of the brackish liquid.

01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:41.728
TALIESIN: I have thoughts. I don't know.

01:15:41.728 --> 01:15:43.751
LAURA: It doesn't trigger anything, at least.

01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:49.465
TALIESIN: I mean, if I were going to make snake
people, I'd put them in a room with snakes and I'd

01:15:49.465 --> 01:15:53.590
have a way of calling the snakes when it's time to
start changing those people into snakes.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:55.863
MARISHA: Maybe the snakes come from the blood
sacrifice.

01:15:55.863 --> 01:15:58.427
TALIESIN: Maybe the blood sacrifice is what lets
them know it's dinner time.

01:15:58.427 --> 01:16:00.575
MARISHA: That's kind of what I said.

01:16:00.575 --> 01:16:05.340
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I think they're going to--
yeah, you got it. I think we've got to move this

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.755
fountain.

01:16:06.755 --> 01:16:10.109
LAURA: Let's move the fountain. Put some rubies in
some eyeballs.

01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:14.860
SAM: Before we go down the fountain, I'm going to
walk past Jamedi again.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:20.365
MATT: He's turned around. He's still chewing the
jerky. He puts his shortbow over his shoulder and

01:16:20.365 --> 01:16:25.204
gathers his things. He's loaded up with pouches
and sacks. He's not designed to be a combatant;

01:16:25.204 --> 01:16:27.245
he's designed to be a traveler.

01:16:27.245 --> 01:16:35.083
SAM: Hoo boy, it's going to be scary down there. I
think what I'm going to do is-- I'm going to take

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:40.339
out the snake idol thing and-- I'm going to do a
quick prayer to my god. Do you want to pray with

01:16:40.339 --> 01:16:42.618
me? Do you worship this one, too?

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:49.044
MATT: I am not a religious man, but I appreciate
your sense of inclusion.

01:16:49.044 --> 01:16:51.063
SAM: I just want you to be part of the team.

01:16:51.063 --> 01:16:52.710
TRAVIS: (laughter) Inclusion.

01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:56.047
SAM: We're a tolerant group.

01:16:56.047 --> 01:16:58.208
MATT: He looks over at the dead serpent people
jammed into holes.

01:16:58.208 --> 01:17:02.020
(laughter)

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.569
MATT: "So it would seem."

01:17:03.569 --> 01:17:05.448
TRAVIS: All evidence to the fucking contrary.

01:17:05.448 --> 01:17:07.403
SAM: To a point.

01:17:07.403 --> 01:17:12.458
LIAM: There's a yuan-ti woman hanging by her arm
off the wall.

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:19.183
TRAVIS: Her fucking arm's in it. Jester is
grabbing naked yuan-ti guy.

01:17:19.183 --> 01:17:21.140
SAM: Maybe not tolerant.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:25.605
TRAVIS: Milking its face.

01:17:25.605 --> 01:17:29.121
SAM: Let's go!

01:17:29.121 --> 01:17:32.044
LAURA: Can we have a refresher on what Jamedi
looks like?

01:17:32.044 --> 01:17:43.436
MATT: Jamedi has dark brown skin, smooth bald
head, gaunt features. He's wearing light cloth,

01:17:43.436 --> 01:17:48.705
billowing sleeves, but it's tied with a bracer to
each side so it doesn't get in the way of his

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:55.561
hands' movement. A few pack and satchels around
him. He looks like what you'd imagine a

01:17:55.561 --> 01:17:59.198
professional dungeoneer would look like, where he
has a few things to defend himself, but he's not a

01:17:59.198 --> 01:18:03.418
combatant by any means. He's very good about
getting in and out of places quickly, unseen, and

01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:05.313
gather as much information as he can.

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.319
TRAVIS: He got to the top of the temple. That was
it, right?

01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.211
MATT: Correct.

01:18:09.211 --> 01:18:10.644
TRAVIS: Nott?

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:15.919
SAM: All right. I'm going to ruby it up. There was
two vacant eye holes?

01:18:15.919 --> 01:18:19.670
MATT: There were three of them. One of them is
missing two eyes, the other is missing one and had

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.579
another gray rock in there.

01:18:21.579 --> 01:18:24.577
TALIESIN: What do I know about this god? About
this snake god?

01:18:24.577 --> 01:18:35.658
MATT: What you know about Zehir: Zehir is a god
that wanders in shadow, is the creator of snakes

01:18:35.658 --> 01:18:44.169
and serpent kin. It is essentially the evil god of
poisons, assassins and darkness. They believe that

01:18:44.169 --> 01:18:53.053
to keep your acts obfuscated and secret is the
greatest means of success. "Strike quickly and

01:18:53.380 --> 01:19:01.216
"without reason. Blind the target with their own
confusion" and "Kill slowly. Agonizingly. Or

01:19:01.216 --> 01:19:07.279
"worse, make them enjoy it," are some of the tenets
of their religion and belief.

01:19:07.279 --> 01:19:13.623
TALIESIN: Let's let that inform us as we figure
out which of these socket the gems go into.

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:16.231
SAM: I'm going to put all of them in!

01:19:16.231 --> 01:19:19.482
LAURA: We only have two rubies. Wait, do you have
three rubies?

01:19:19.482 --> 01:19:24.126
SAM: I have three-- oh. One was stuck to the back
of another one.

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:27.404
LAURA: Oh, that makes perfect sense.

01:19:27.404 --> 01:19:28.479
SAM: That's how rubies--

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:29.892
LAURA: Rubies are very sticky.

01:19:29.892 --> 01:19:33.990
SAM: Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:38.200
LAURA: It's okay.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.119
MATT: You reach into the water and place--

01:19:40.119 --> 01:19:42.902
TALIESIN: Do we want to do all three at the same
time?

01:19:42.902 --> 01:19:45.080
LAURA: He already did it.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.223
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's fair.

01:19:46.223 --> 01:19:47.645
SAM: I'm going to one at a time using Mage Hand.

01:19:47.645 --> 01:19:49.404
LAURA: Oh, good call.

01:19:49.404 --> 01:19:56.519
MATT: Using Mage Hand into the water, it finds its
way in. Seems to wedge into and affix. Mage Hand

01:19:56.519 --> 01:20:03.841
again into a second one. On one side, the
grime-covered snake that's coiled up there now has

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:11.183
two glittering ruby eyes peering out unnaturally
versus the rest of its relatively bland dark

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:18.273
gray-green body. You take it and place it in the
opposing socket. As soon as it slicks into place,

01:20:18.273 --> 01:20:30.693
you all hear this grinding of stone. The fountain
shifts, and begins to slowly spiral down below. As

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:38.371
it begins to move downward beneath, it begins to
show the about two feet of stone of the floor that

01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:45.690
you're standing on eventually gives way to the
roof of a chamber below you. Lightless, it is

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:47.758
pitch black below.

01:20:47.758 --> 01:20:49.510
SAM: We're between floors now?

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:53.576
MATT: You're still standing on the outside of the
fountain looking down in. Only just the outskirts

01:20:53.576 --> 01:21:01.417
of the fountain went down in this slow spiral. You
glance downward. It stops about ten feet below

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:07.086
you. It comes to a stop. There's a bit of a
ten-foot drop to where the fountain is, and now

01:21:07.086 --> 01:21:13.610
below where it was standing, there's about two
feet of smooth pillar, and then very thin stairs

01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:24.629
that continue to spiral down. Those of you with
darkvision, since there was no light source in

01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:29.302
here, you can see in pitch black of dim light
within 30 feet. The chamber itself goes just

01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:37.766
beyond that, so you cannot see the floor of the
chamber. What you can see: the boughs of stunted

01:21:37.766 --> 01:21:48.778
trees. The smell hits you as you lean forward:
it's a fresh earth and vegetation mixed with a

01:21:48.778 --> 01:21:59.622
smell of fermentation and rot. It seems that below
in this chamber, there is a small orchard of some

01:21:59.622 --> 01:22:02.998
kind that exists without sunlight.

01:22:02.998 --> 01:22:05.340
LAURA: Cool!

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.384
TRAVIS: Oh, but maybe it's nurtured by--

01:22:08.384 --> 01:22:10.159
SAM: Blood.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:11.566
TRAVIS: Blood and viscous--

01:22:11.566 --> 01:22:13.877
LAURA: Oh, shit, it only grows by the blood.

01:22:13.877 --> 01:22:16.749
SAM: It's a blood orange orchard.

01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:18.891
TRAVIS: You can do better than that.

01:22:18.891 --> 01:22:23.119
MATT: What do you do?

01:22:23.119 --> 01:22:25.034
LAURA: Could you send some light down there,
Caleb?

01:22:25.034 --> 01:22:28.742
LIAM: I could do that. Do we want to do that?
What's down there?

01:22:28.742 --> 01:22:32.621
TALIESIN: Can we throw a little light down there
to see if anything tries to bite at it?

01:22:32.621 --> 01:22:37.855
LIAM: Eh, let me borrow this. Frumpkin flies just
down to the fountain.

01:22:37.855 --> 01:22:40.492
MATT: Okay. (flittering)

01:22:40.492 --> 01:22:45.236
LIAM: I want to see, if I bamf into Frumpkin, if I
can hear anything below.

01:22:45.236 --> 01:22:46.910
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:48.712
LIAM: At advantage.

01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:49.634
LAURA: Why?

01:22:49.634 --> 01:22:58.723
LIAM: Because he's an owl, and has advantage over
hearing. Terrible, both terrible rolls. Eight.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:02.741
MATT: Absolutely silent.

01:23:02.741 --> 01:23:17.757
LIAM: Frumpkin's back on your shoulder. Okay. Four
globules of light lower down to the fountain and

01:23:17.757 --> 01:23:20.835
look over the side to see what that lights up.

01:23:20.835 --> 01:23:24.887
MATT: As you guys glance down, these small orbs
begin to illuminate the base on the floor. The

01:23:24.887 --> 01:23:32.109
pillar drops down about 40 feet. The chamber is
about 40-foot from floor to ceiling. You have

01:23:32.109 --> 01:23:36.502
about ten feet before you hit the actual staircase
down, but it's a thin staircase. Each step is

01:23:36.502 --> 01:23:39.118
maybe about seven or so inches wide.

01:23:39.118 --> 01:23:41.378
LAURA: Oh, that's terrifying.

01:23:41.378 --> 01:23:43.760
TRAVIS: Nott, want to do us a favor to make sure
our way is safe?

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.400
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.554
LAURA: Wait, let him keep explaining things
first.

01:23:48.554 --> 01:23:49.887
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, sorry.

01:23:49.887 --> 01:23:54.992
MATT: You guys look over and see this as well, the
orbs float down and light the area. It is a thick

01:23:54.992 --> 01:24:03.243
mass of jungle vines and roots, and damp earth
that hits the floor. You can see a lot of these

01:24:03.243 --> 01:24:09.121
similar trees. It's just this singular type of
tree that is just repeatedly planted throughout

01:24:09.121 --> 01:24:22.289
the area. You can see these slightly green- to
yellow-colored fruit that are bared by these

01:24:22.289 --> 01:24:27.514
various trees, a lot of which have fallen and are
beginning to ferment on the ground and rot. That's

01:24:27.514 --> 01:24:31.884
where you get the smell that hit you originally.
Some of them that have fallen begin to just slowly

01:24:31.884 --> 01:24:36.577
rot away and decompose into the floor of this
orchard.

01:24:36.577 --> 01:24:39.485
SAM: I love me some rotten fruit.

01:24:39.485 --> 01:24:42.252
LIAM: Did you say how far to the bottom it
seemed?

01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:46.054
MATT: About 40 feet from where you are. About 30
feet once you hit the stairs.

01:24:46.054 --> 01:24:49.990
SAM: All right, I'll jump down to the platform.

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:52.583
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check for me.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:57.963
SAM: Ooh, yeah. A check? 26.

01:24:57.963 --> 01:25:02.203
MATT: Easy enough to do. Even the slick spots and
as it ground its way down smeared some of the

01:25:02.203 --> 01:25:06.756
algae along the outside, which caused a faint bit
of slickness on outside of the pillar. Using that,

01:25:06.756 --> 01:25:13.235
without an issue, slide, land on the top step. It
holds your weight.

01:25:13.235 --> 01:25:20.055
SAM: I'll take a drink. (huffing) I'm going to
start going down the steps and feeling my way for

01:25:20.055 --> 01:25:22.586
traps and stuff.

01:25:22.586 --> 01:25:24.134
MATT: You got it.

01:25:24.134 --> 01:25:25.810
SAM: Is that cocked?

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:27.004
LAURA: No.

01:25:27.004 --> 01:25:28.394
SAM: Okay, I can't tell what it is.

01:25:28.394 --> 01:25:29.672
LAURA: That's an eight.

01:25:29.672 --> 01:25:33.359
SAM: That's a 17 for investigation.

01:25:33.359 --> 01:25:37.491
MATT: For investigation to see if there are any
traps on the way down. No traps. It is a simple

01:25:37.491 --> 01:25:42.125
descent and as soon as you hit the soft floor of
the orchard, it's just natural ground around you

01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:43.655
in the immediate vicinity.

01:25:43.655 --> 01:25:45.687
SAM: Are there any fruits lying around on the
ground?

01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:51.913
MATT: Yeah, two that are within a foot of where
you stand. They're somewhat beginning to ferment.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.907
SAM: I'll pick one up and smell it. (sniffing)

01:25:53.907 --> 01:25:55.246
TRAVIS: Ah-ah!

01:25:55.246 --> 01:25:59.997
MATT: Yeah. The interior is a bright orange-yellow
color. It looks fleshy, like the inside of a

01:25:59.997 --> 01:26:07.622
mango. It smells sweet, but it has that turning
point where it's starting to get a little bit--

01:26:07.622 --> 01:26:09.895
SAM: Do I like it?

01:26:09.895 --> 01:26:10.733
MATT: Yeah.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:11.712
TRAVIS: No, Nott!

01:26:11.712 --> 01:26:14.261
LAURA: What if they eat this fruit and that's how
they-- I'm not there.

01:26:14.261 --> 01:26:15.664
TRAVIS: Don't take it. No, Nott.

01:26:15.664 --> 01:26:19.374
SAM: I'm going to lick it.

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.796
MATT: It tastes sweet and tangy.

01:26:21.796 --> 01:26:26.178
TRAVIS: These trees grow in total darkness.

01:26:26.178 --> 01:26:27.500
LAURA: You're not there, either.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.645
SAM: I'm just taking a little bite.

01:26:28.645 --> 01:26:33.631
MATT: Okay. You nibble a little bit. It tastes
pretty good. It's got that tang to it, that iron-y

01:26:33.631 --> 01:26:36.344
tang aftertaste to it.

01:26:36.344 --> 01:26:37.888
SAM: I'll just eat one.

01:26:37.888 --> 01:26:39.546
MARISHA: Iron-y!

01:26:39.546 --> 01:26:41.873
MATT: Okay, you eat it. What are you guys doing?

01:26:41.873 --> 01:26:45.274
LIAM: Well, Fjord is nudging at Caleb--

01:26:45.274 --> 01:26:47.061
SAM: It's clear, come on down!

01:26:47.061 --> 01:26:49.860
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.798
MARISHA: He's looking! He's finger flipping!

01:26:51.798 --> 01:26:53.379
SAM: He's checking his Twitter. He's fine.

01:26:53.379 --> 01:26:56.330
MATT: It's just fun to fuck with you guys.

01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:58.395
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:26:58.395 --> 01:27:02.132
LIAM: In answer to your quiet question, I could
take the silver thread out and--

01:27:02.132 --> 01:27:03.924
LAURA: I jump down, too.

01:27:03.924 --> 01:27:05.747
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

01:27:05.747 --> 01:27:10.132
LIAM: I could have helped, okay. Everybody's doing
things too quickly. That thread will take me ten

01:27:10.132 --> 01:27:11.260
minutes.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:15.243
MATT: You catch yourself there, but keep yourself
up and begin to descend down the steps and below.

01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:18.000
TRAVIS: I was going to have Caleb put the silver
string at the entrance so we'd know if somebody

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.419
came in.

01:27:19.419 --> 01:27:22.018
LIAM: That's ten minutes if we want to take it.

01:27:22.018 --> 01:27:24.271
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: It's locked and we have the
key.

01:27:24.271 --> 01:27:27.239
TRAVIS: How did we get in? We picked the lock.
We'll be fine.

01:27:27.239 --> 01:27:28.789
MARISHA: I jump down.

01:27:28.789 --> 01:27:30.906
MATT: Okay, Beau, acrobatics check.

01:27:30.906 --> 01:27:32.457
LIAM: Jump just down the 40 feet?

01:27:32.457 --> 01:27:36.760
SAM: No, to the staircase. It's a ten-foot fall.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.368
MARISHA: 14.

01:27:40.368 --> 01:27:46.207
MATT: You hit it and your foot hits a slick spot.
You catch yourself and hold onto the edge, adjust,

01:27:46.207 --> 01:27:48.748
and then continue down without issue.

01:27:48.748 --> 01:27:51.781
LAURA: Oh god, 14 is like the--

01:27:51.781 --> 01:27:54.512
MARISHA: It's pretty high, considering.

01:27:54.512 --> 01:27:56.141
LIAM: You two are down, the two of you?

01:27:56.141 --> 01:27:57.090
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:58.514
LIAM: You're up at the top of the tower?

01:27:58.514 --> 01:28:02.199
SAM: No, she jumped already. It's you, Caduceus,
and Fjord, I think.

01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:05.112
TALIESIN: I'm making an athletics check. Ten.

01:28:05.112 --> 01:28:11.135
MATT: Ten! Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot
of handhold in this area. It's a smooth ten-foot

01:28:11.135 --> 01:28:15.525
space and as you try to find a handhold to grab
onto, you just fall straight down.

01:28:15.525 --> 01:28:18.496
LIAM: I cast Feather Fall on him, and me, and him,
and Yasha.

01:28:18.496 --> 01:28:19.798
SAM: You can do that?

01:28:19.798 --> 01:28:20.951
MATT: On how many?

01:28:20.951 --> 01:28:22.625
LIAM: On five people.

01:28:22.625 --> 01:28:24.197
MATT: That's awesome. That's slick.

01:28:24.197 --> 01:28:30.915
LIAM: "Choose up to five falling creatures within
range." I guess I push the two of you as I fall.

01:28:30.915 --> 01:28:34.364
MATT: Yeah, I was going to say: they're not
falling. As soon as he slips in--

01:28:34.364 --> 01:28:37.643
LIAM: I see him fall and I shove these two off and
I go (casting).

01:28:37.643 --> 01:28:39.529
MATT: Okay, do you take it? Do you guys--

01:28:39.529 --> 01:28:43.254
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I'm looking over the edge
like this.

01:28:43.254 --> 01:28:45.637
MATT: As Caleb sees this happening: shoves.

01:28:45.637 --> 01:28:48.272
TRAVIS: I should've known--!

01:28:48.272 --> 01:28:52.129
MATT: The four of you fall and begin to slowly
drift.

01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:55.893
TRAVIS: -- that you had everything under control.

01:28:55.893 --> 01:29:00.625
MATT: You all land gently on the tips of your toes
before the rest of your body finds its weight now

01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:04.365
resting onto the soft floor of the subterranean
orchard.

01:29:04.365 --> 01:29:06.012
LAURA: That was pretty cool.

01:29:06.012 --> 01:29:07.189
SAM: Wow!

01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:08.512
LIAM: That's a good one.

01:29:08.512 --> 01:29:10.281
TALIESIN: I'm going to let the trees know that
we're here.

01:29:10.281 --> 01:29:13.545
MATT: Nott, about a minute's past since you've
eaten that fruit and you start feeling a little

01:29:13.545 --> 01:29:15.499
tingly on the inside of your body.

01:29:15.499 --> 01:29:17.061
SAM: Yummy.

01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:18.488
LAURA: Tingly how?

01:29:18.488 --> 01:29:20.391
LIAM: Does it burn when you pee?

01:29:20.391 --> 01:29:23.992
MATT: You turn to look at Caleb and it's crazy.
His hair's purple, now it's pink, now it's orange,

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:25.054
now it's purple.

01:29:25.054 --> 01:29:26.281
SAM: Oh no!

01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:27.560
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.858
SAM: What is happening?

01:29:29.858 --> 01:29:32.642
TRAVIS: Your eyes are like big black saucers.

01:29:32.642 --> 01:29:35.136
MATT: His pupils are purely dilated.

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:41.126
LIAM: Your eyes are normally like tea saucers, but
now they're like full plates. Are you all right?

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:43.281
SAM: (giggling)

01:29:43.281 --> 01:29:48.582
MATT: As you're glancing around, the light orbs
that are slowly drifting, they're leaving trails behind.

01:29:49.163 --> 01:29:54.830
SAM: Oh, yes. You should try some of this fruit,
guys.

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.559
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:57.641
LAURA: Oh god.

01:29:57.641 --> 01:29:59.090
MATT: With disadvantage because you--

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:00.944
LAURA: Because you're high as fuck.

01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:02.112
SAM: Six.

01:30:02.112 --> 01:30:03.914
MATT: Six, okay.

01:30:03.914 --> 01:30:09.574
SAM: Man, this is the craziest place we've ever
been.

01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:13.952
LAURA: Nott, are you okay?

01:30:13.952 --> 01:30:21.529
SAM: Do that more. It feels nice, the wind. Do
that more. Slower.

01:30:21.529 --> 01:30:24.440
LIAM: How much have you had from that bottle of
yours?

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.994
SAM: Just let me enjoy this.

01:30:25.994 --> 01:30:30.600
(laughter)

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:39.622
SAM: Man, I just had one of these fruits, and I
think I know everything now. You know, it doesn't

01:30:39.622 --> 01:30:45.431
matter if Jamedi's alive or dead; we're all going
to be dead at some point.

01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:48.579
TRAVIS: I think he's clearly messed up. Did you
have a fresh fruit or--

01:30:48.579 --> 01:30:52.259
MATT: At this point, Jamedi and Avantika have
managed to join you below in the chamber.

01:30:52.259 --> 01:30:54.217
SAM: Oh! Hey!

01:30:54.217 --> 01:30:57.738
MATT: "Hello?"

01:30:57.738 --> 01:30:59.451
SAM: Hey!

01:30:59.451 --> 01:31:05.516
MATT: Jamedi he pulls out a torch and lights it
up. It's very bright.

01:31:05.516 --> 01:31:06.827
SAM: Ah!

01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:09.734
(laughter)

01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:11.601
MATT: Everyone turns slowly to Nott.

01:31:11.601 --> 01:31:14.244
TRAVIS: It's like Rocket Raccoon going through the
dimensional rifts.

01:31:14.244 --> 01:31:18.433
LIAM: There's already a merry go round of lights
going around Nott's head.

01:31:18.433 --> 01:31:25.223
MATT: As the faint orbs are met with the brighter
torchlight from Jamedi, it opens up the chamber.

01:31:25.223 --> 01:31:29.248
LIAM: It's like the sun in here.

01:31:29.248 --> 01:31:38.366
MATT: This entire chamber is roughly 70-ish feet
by about 50 feet in size. This orchard, these

01:31:38.366 --> 01:31:40.631
trees are everywhere.

01:31:40.631 --> 01:31:43.111
LIAM: Five-sided still?

01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:48.837
MATT: No, this chamber is four-sided, actually. It
seems-- make an intelligence check, actually.

01:31:50.489 --> 01:31:53.187
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:31:53.187 --> 01:31:58.336
MATT: Based on the shape of the temple as you saw
it, the size of the chamber you were just in, and

01:31:58.336 --> 01:32:02.944
the chamber below, there should be more space on
the sides and the front of it. It looks like this

01:32:02.944 --> 01:32:07.732
is probably a central chamber of this floor.

01:32:07.732 --> 01:32:11.521
TRAVIS: It's 50 by 70.

01:32:11.521 --> 01:32:13.534
LAURA: Do we see any movement in here?

01:32:13.534 --> 01:32:16.469
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.
Well, with advantage because you have the

01:32:16.469 --> 01:32:20.442
torchlight on. Or no, sorry, regular roll. Brain
working! It's been a week.

01:32:20.442 --> 01:32:22.472
LAURA: It's very shitty. Six.

01:32:22.472 --> 01:32:24.209
MATT: Yeah, nothing.

01:32:24.209 --> 01:32:28.389
TALIESIN: I'm going to let the trees-- I'm not
going to touch the tree, but I'm going to walk up.

01:32:28.389 --> 01:32:35.670
I don't know the last time you had people in here,
but we're going to try and pass through. If you

01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:40.616
want, we'll take some fruit, if you want the fruit
to leave the chamber. If not, we'll try and do our

01:32:40.616 --> 01:32:45.803
best to leave it be. We respect your space here.

01:32:45.803 --> 01:32:47.496
MATT: Seems receptive.

01:32:47.496 --> 01:32:48.827
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:32:48.827 --> 01:32:54.811
TRAVIS: Jamedi, Captain, either of you know
anything about these trees, or its fruit that

01:32:54.811 --> 01:32:56.577
grows in darkness?

01:32:56.577 --> 01:33:03.947
MATT: Jamedi looks around. "I did not go this far
into the temple. I returned for your aid, so no."

01:33:03.947 --> 01:33:08.828
TALIESIN: Does this look or smell like anything
those people eat?

01:33:08.828 --> 01:33:12.769
MATT: "It is very possible. I didn't spend too
much time studying the inner workings of their

01:33:12.911 --> 01:33:19.288
"day-to-day. I was more focused on surviving."
Avantika's looking around, arms crossed, glancing,

01:33:19.288 --> 01:33:21.670
keeping her hands near her weapons.

01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:25.942
TALIESIN: I don't see how those things are
non-interchangeable.

01:33:25.942 --> 01:33:28.955
MARISHA: Does this seem to be a lot of fruit?

01:33:28.955 --> 01:33:34.641
MATT: It's not a massive amount of it, but each
tree is in the process, maybe holding about a few dozen.

01:33:34.911 --> 01:33:38.758
TALIESIN: It's like I got a lemon tree!

01:33:38.758 --> 01:33:43.226
LAURA: Does this seem like anything we've seen
before anywhere, these trees? This fruit?

01:33:43.226 --> 01:33:51.721
MATT: No, not this stunted. They're squat trunk,
and the top doesn't reach the very top of this

01:33:51.721 --> 01:33:56.383
chamber. They're about five or so feet below.
They're not massive trees by any means, but the

01:33:56.383 --> 01:34:03.252
idea of trees like this-- and as you look at it
now, the color-- previously, you had just the

01:34:03.252 --> 01:34:07.397
faint light. Looking across the ground as you look
up towards the leaves in these trees, the

01:34:07.397 --> 01:34:16.848
coloration's not green, necessarily. It's more of
a deep purplish brown color to the leaves.

01:34:16.848 --> 01:34:18.528
LAURA: Creepy.

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:21.886
TRAVIS: What's our footing like? Stone, roots,
wet?

01:34:21.886 --> 01:34:27.463
MATT: Currently, it looks to be soft earth, and
where are the roots and various vines that have

01:34:27.463 --> 01:34:33.700
entwined their way around from other plant life
that have been subsisting off of the ecosystem

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.544
that's built in this space.

01:34:36.544 --> 01:34:40.227
LIAM: What about entrances and exits?

01:34:40.227 --> 01:34:43.180
MATT: You can certainly go check. Make an
investigation check.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:47.529
LIAM: Nott, will you come with me, please? Never
mind. Beau, will you come with me, please?

01:34:47.529 --> 01:34:49.180
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:53.245
MATT: Your vision is jittery there, Nott.

01:34:53.245 --> 01:34:55.404
SAM: Oh sure. I'm going to sit.

01:34:55.404 --> 01:34:56.834
TALIESIN: Yeah, Fjord?

01:34:56.834 --> 01:35:06.029
TRAVIS: I heard what you said to the trees. Any
way to see what runs through these things?

01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:22.001
TALIESIN: How are you all drinking? What is it
that you live off of? How is this possible in

01:35:22.136 --> 01:35:29.559
here? I'm going to quickly, out of fear, cast Eyes
of the Grave one more time.

01:35:29.559 --> 01:35:34.633
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, the same source. The
one small blip on your radar: Jamedi.

01:35:34.633 --> 01:35:36.160
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.529
MATT: In thinking of those questions, the ground
itself is damper around the base of the fountain.

01:35:41.529 --> 01:35:44.605
TRAVIS: Directly below where the fountain was?

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:45.811
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:45.811 --> 01:35:48.953
TALIESIN: These are carnivorous. Are the trees the
same color as the blood of these creatures

01:35:48.953 --> 01:35:51.382
upstairs? Is it a similar--?

01:35:51.382 --> 01:35:58.218
MATT: You could say it's comparable in some ways.
It goes from a brown to a faint purple-ish tint.

01:35:58.218 --> 01:36:01.511
TALIESIN: I think they've been feeding these
things.

01:36:01.511 --> 01:36:03.392
MARISHA: Yeah, with blood. Definitely with blood.

01:36:03.392 --> 01:36:05.403
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, they're pouring bloody water down
here.

01:36:05.403 --> 01:36:07.291
TRAVIS: But why?

01:36:07.291 --> 01:36:12.097
MARISHA: Well, judging by Nott's reaction right
now, and we've already seen that these people

01:36:12.097 --> 01:36:16.939
hunt, so clearly this fruit isn't their main food
supply.

01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:19.341
LAURA: They like to get high!

01:36:19.341 --> 01:36:25.178
TALIESIN: Is there any signs of animal life in
here? Is it any more complex of an ecosystem? I

01:36:25.178 --> 01:36:27.221
feel like I'm missing something.

01:36:27.221 --> 01:36:35.628
MATT: You don't see any signs of animals. You
don't see bits of droppings or claw marks or teeth

01:36:35.628 --> 01:36:38.627
marks on any of the nearby trees at all.

01:36:38.627 --> 01:36:40.761
MARISHA: I'm assuming it's for rituals.

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:42.166
MATT: You're looking for?

01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:46.753
LIAM: Entrances, exits, stonework, writing. I
think you said investigation?

01:36:46.753 --> 01:36:50.538
MATT: Investigation check, because at an immediate
glance you don't see. There's no open archway or anything.

01:36:50.562 --> 01:36:52.410
LIAM: 18.

01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:53.768
MARISHA: Ten.

01:36:53.768 --> 01:36:58.031
MATT: As you two begin to make a perimeter, you
don't see any doorways. What you do see are on the

01:36:58.031 --> 01:37:06.778
south wall, the western wall, and the northern
wall, there are large stone tablets that are

01:37:06.778 --> 01:37:13.686
affixed to the wall. Similar to the ones you saw
above that have almost mirroring inscriptions of

01:37:13.686 --> 01:37:21.078
this same vision of Zehir bestowing these
mutations upon the followers. On the bottom of

01:37:21.078 --> 01:37:31.746
each of these tablets there is a hole that's about
12 inches wide and about five or six inches tall.

01:37:31.746 --> 01:37:34.135
MARISHA: A tablet? A door?

01:37:34.135 --> 01:37:38.534
MATT: There's no door that you can tell, but you
see these large stone tablets that are affixed to

01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:43.793
the north, western, and south wall. Each of these
tablets is about maybe eight feet wide, ten feet

01:37:43.793 --> 01:37:50.236
tall and the base of it, right before where it
meets the floor, there is a little space. A little

01:37:50.236 --> 01:37:56.046
hole, if you will, that's about 12-14 inches wide
and about 4-5 inches tall.

01:37:56.046 --> 01:37:58.572
LAURA: Is it roundy or is it rectangular?

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:04.864
MATT: It's rectangular. You also see amongst the
ground as your walking, your foot hits something

01:38:04.864 --> 01:38:10.459
and you look down and you can see a wicker basket.
An empty wicker basket that's overturned.

01:38:10.459 --> 01:38:13.469
LIAM: Is there any blood in the wicker basket?

01:38:13.469 --> 01:38:14.825
MATT: No.

01:38:14.825 --> 01:38:17.903
TALIESIN: I think it's for fruit collecting.

01:38:17.903 --> 01:38:22.690
MARISHA: I grab Nott and say: Can I pick you up?

01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:26.204
SAM: I thought I was already picked up.

01:38:26.204 --> 01:38:31.599
MARISHA: Pick Nott up, walk Nott over to one of
the tablets. We'll say the north wall and I face

01:38:31.599 --> 01:38:34.623
Nott towards the tablet and I say: What do you
see?

01:38:34.623 --> 01:38:37.898
TRAVIS: (deep warped voice) What do you see?

01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:42.308
SAM: (gibberish)

01:38:42.308 --> 01:38:46.927
MATT: As these globes of light are brought over to
see it, it's quite beautiful, but before you even

01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:52.417
see the relief in the wall, there's this extremely
bright series of symbols glowing on the stone in

01:38:52.417 --> 01:38:54.030
front of you.

01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:56.063
MARISHA: You can see glowing symbols? Sorry, you
didn't tell me that.

01:38:56.063 --> 01:38:57.983
SAM: Oh! What, huh?

01:38:57.983 --> 01:38:59.007
MARISHA: What do you see?

01:38:59.007 --> 01:39:00.355
SAM: I see glowing symbols.

01:39:00.355 --> 01:39:04.104
MARISHA: Holy shit. But I can't see glowing
symbols?

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.811
SAM: They're so fucking bright!

01:39:05.811 --> 01:39:07.076
LAURA: Can you draw them? What do they say?

01:39:07.076 --> 01:39:08.020
SAM: Wait, you can't see them?

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.440
MATT: They look like that.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.362
SAM: You can't see this? You can see me, can't
you?

01:39:13.362 --> 01:39:18.605
MARISHA: Yeah. I walk Nott over to the western
wall. What is it?

01:39:18.605 --> 01:39:21.529
MATT: Another set of symbols. Say it! What is it?

01:39:21.529 --> 01:39:23.753
SAM: (screaming)

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:29.241
LIAM: Let's hold on a second. It's been less than
an hour. If I put my hand-- oh wait, no it hasn't.

01:39:29.241 --> 01:39:30.496
MATT: No, It's been more than an hour.

01:39:30.496 --> 01:39:33.033
LIAM: I'm going to start casting Comprehend
Languages again.

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:35.074
MARISHA: I take Nott over to the southern wall.

01:39:35.074 --> 01:39:40.387
SAM: Stop this! I can't take any more!

01:39:40.387 --> 01:39:45.541
MARISHA: Draw! Draw, Nott, draw!

01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:50.257
SAM: (sobbing) I've seen too much.

01:39:50.257 --> 01:39:53.361
LAURA: Should we have been keeping track of which
ones were on which wall?

01:39:53.361 --> 01:40:00.552
MARISHA: I went northern, western, southern. That
is right, right?

01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:05.747
SAM: I think that's the right order. I don't
understand any of this shit!

01:40:05.747 --> 01:40:07.687
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:40:08.934 --> 01:40:10.468
SAM: Seven.

01:40:10.468 --> 01:40:12.051
MATT: Okay.

01:40:12.605 --> 01:40:14.931
LAURA: Caleb, do you want to eat some fruit and
look at the--?

01:40:14.931 --> 01:40:16.269
SAM: Do you want me to draw what I see?

01:40:16.269 --> 01:40:17.165
LAURA: Yeah.

01:40:17.165 --> 01:40:18.854
LIAM: Feed me while I'm casting.

01:40:18.854 --> 01:40:20.790
TALIESIN: I think maybe you should draw what you
see.

01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:23.287
LIAM: Give me ten minutes. That's on the tablets,
right?

01:40:23.287 --> 01:40:24.252
TRAVIS: Any tracks in the dirt?

01:40:24.252 --> 01:40:25.258
MATT: Make a survival check.

01:40:25.258 --> 01:40:29.994
LAURA: I give her my sketchbook with ink and stuff
so she can draw the runes that she sees.

01:40:29.994 --> 01:40:31.938
MATT: Okay.

01:40:31.938 --> 01:40:34.108
TRAVIS: 13.

01:40:34.108 --> 01:40:49.884
MATT: You can see some grooves in the damp dirt,
and areas where the soft bits of leaves that are

01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:54.489
fallen that are pressed down, but the grooves are
pushed through pressure.

01:40:54.489 --> 01:40:56.649
TRAVIS: Not necessarily bipedal.

01:40:56.649 --> 01:40:58.175
MATT: No, not necessarily.

01:40:58.175 --> 01:41:00.453
LAURA: I thought you were trying to say "by
people."

01:41:00.453 --> 01:41:09.491
MATT: That works, too. Attempting to sketch these
over, I'm going to say make an intelligence check

01:41:09.491 --> 01:41:11.660
with disadvantage, please, Nott.

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:16.051
SAM: Okay. Intelligence check.

01:41:16.051 --> 01:41:18.092
MATT: Yes.

01:41:18.092 --> 01:41:20.589
SAM: 13.

01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:27.665
MATT: You do what you think is a decent job trying
to copy what you see. It takes a little while.

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:31.699
LIAM: That would punch in the ten minutes I need
to cast Comprehend, so I will retrace all the

01:41:31.699 --> 01:41:37.342
steps, and place my hands on that writing to see
if it reveals its meaning to me.

01:41:37.342 --> 01:41:40.746
MATT: Okay, looking at the spell here.

01:41:40.746 --> 01:41:43.243
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's an interesting question.

01:41:43.243 --> 01:41:45.989
LAURA: (singing) You need to eat some fruit.

01:41:45.989 --> 01:41:51.769
SAM: I'm going to take some time to start painting
my skin, and drawing my skin because it feels so good.

01:41:51.913 --> 01:41:56.874
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're literally peeling up your
skin, cool. (scratching)

01:42:06.692 --> 01:42:11.032
MATT: It doesn't do anything, because you cannot
see the language. You have to be able to touch it

01:42:11.032 --> 01:42:12.628
and see it to read it.

01:42:12.628 --> 01:42:14.274
LAURA: Eat the fruit.

01:42:14.274 --> 01:42:16.884
LIAM: (foomph) Lights floating around.

01:42:16.884 --> 01:42:18.822
MATT: Right. You see no language.

01:42:18.822 --> 01:42:21.024
LAURA: You have to eat the fruit.

01:42:21.024 --> 01:42:23.526
LIAM: Oh, I didn't know that she sees it because--
Oh, I didn't know.

01:42:23.526 --> 01:42:25.147
MATT: You're figuring this out now as you go to
the wall.

01:42:25.147 --> 01:42:27.274
LIAM: I do a lot of reading of spells and not a
lot of paying attention, you guys.

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:32.242
MATT: That's okay. As you go to the wall, there's
nothing there. You're like, "There's no language there."

01:42:32.666 --> 01:42:33.776
LAURA: Here.

01:42:33.776 --> 01:42:34.897
LIAM: So that's how you see it?

01:42:34.897 --> 01:42:36.649
LAURA: I cut some fruit and stick it on his
mouth.

01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:39.960
TALIESIN: Why don't you have the owl see it and
maybe you could see through the owl.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:42.011
LAURA: Too late, I already put it on his mouth.

01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:43.638
TALIESIN: Or you could just eat that.

01:42:43.638 --> 01:42:44.599
MARISHA: I help it down a little bit more.

01:42:44.599 --> 01:42:46.564
SAM: Is this good enough for him to discern?

01:42:46.564 --> 01:42:49.781
LAURA: Too late, he's already getting high!

01:42:49.781 --> 01:42:52.756
MATT: (laughs) Caleb eats the fruit!

01:42:52.756 --> 01:42:54.556
TRAVIS: He bought the ticket.

01:42:54.556 --> 01:42:59.536
MATT: That would have been probably decent enough
to get through that message. Over the next minute

01:42:59.536 --> 01:43:07.941
or so, Caleb, the colors of the lights begin to
shift. You guys watch as Caleb begins to slowly

01:43:07.941 --> 01:43:14.893
move the floating orbs in different patterns. Gets
distracted by his own cantrip.

01:43:14.893 --> 01:43:18.144
TRAVIS: (deep and warped) Caleb, how are you
feeling?

01:43:18.144 --> 01:43:22.732
LIAM: Hey, I stole this ring from you!

01:43:22.732 --> 01:43:25.917
LAURA: Caleb, Caleb, Caleb!

01:43:25.917 --> 01:43:27.722
LIAM: Oh, it echoes in here.

01:43:27.722 --> 01:43:29.764
MATT: Caleb, make a perception check.

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:39.473
LIAM: That is a 16 total.

01:43:39.473 --> 01:43:43.788
MATT: Actually, it would be with disadvantage,
because of the effect of the--

01:43:44.804 --> 01:43:46.540
LIAM: That is a 12.

01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:50.945
MATT: Glancing about the interior of the chamber,
you look in the directions where Nott was and you

01:43:50.945 --> 01:43:56.230
can see the three markers, and you see a faint
fourth glow from the eastern wall.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:58.330
LIAM: Eastern wall.

01:43:58.330 --> 01:44:00.060
LAURA: There's another wall.

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:05.696
LIAM: I feel really good, but I know--

01:44:05.696 --> 01:44:07.948
LAURA: Tell us what the walls say.

01:44:07.948 --> 01:44:09.434
LIAM: Wait, wait.

01:44:09.434 --> 01:44:11.241
ALL: Wait.

01:44:11.241 --> 01:44:15.286
LIAM: I know that I am not in a good position, so
somebody come with me to make sure--

01:44:15.286 --> 01:44:16.760
SAM: I'll go!

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.493
TRAVIS and MARISHA: No, no, not you.

01:44:19.493 --> 01:44:20.979
SAM: I protect him!

01:44:20.979 --> 01:44:22.402
LAURA: I go with him.

01:44:22.402 --> 01:44:25.216
TRAVIS: I pick up Nott by the scruff of her neck
and am holding her.

01:44:25.216 --> 01:44:26.485
SAM: It's so far!

01:44:26.485 --> 01:44:31.184
TALIESIN: I am going to sit on unbelievably high
alert, and this place is giving me the heebie jeebies.

01:44:31.330 --> 01:44:34.193
MATT: Jamedi is holding the torch as a light
source for those who need it. Avantika is

01:44:34.193 --> 01:44:36.577
grinning, watching this whole thing.

01:44:36.577 --> 01:44:39.058
TALIESIN: I'm making my own light source on the
staff now.

01:44:39.058 --> 01:44:45.521
MATT: As you're walking by, Avantika saunters up
to you, Fjord, and goes like, "I can certainly

01:44:45.662 --> 01:44:49.345
"say, this is the most entertaining bunch I've
traveled with in some time."

01:44:49.345 --> 01:44:51.532
TRAVIS: Consummate professionals, that's what we
are.

01:44:51.532 --> 01:44:54.974
MATT: "Oh, of course. We wouldn't be this far if
they weren't."

01:44:54.974 --> 01:44:56.521
LIAM: Blueberry, come on.

01:44:56.521 --> 01:44:57.854
LAURA: I'm coming!

01:44:57.854 --> 01:45:00.627
MATT: You head to the southern wall.

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:04.009
LIAM: Yeah, I always know where north is, so it's
one of these ways.

01:45:04.009 --> 01:45:07.261
MARISHA: "So it's one of these ways."

01:45:07.261 --> 01:45:09.039
SAM: You can see words.

01:45:09.039 --> 01:45:10.122
LAURA: What does it say?

01:45:10.122 --> 01:45:11.421
MATT: He cast Comprehend Languages.

01:45:11.421 --> 01:45:12.607
MARISHA: Is that south?

01:45:12.607 --> 01:45:13.708
LAURA: That's the east.

01:45:13.708 --> 01:45:17.984
LIAM: He said south just now. I thought you said
south. East was the one that we hadn't checked out yet.

01:45:17.984 --> 01:45:19.035
MATT: Correct.

01:45:19.035 --> 01:45:20.131
MARISHA: You better be writing this shit down.

01:45:20.131 --> 01:45:24.479
LIAM: But I don't know which way I am going at the
moment, so DM, which way does my keen, addled mind

01:45:24.479 --> 01:45:26.641
tell me the direction I just went. South?

01:45:26.641 --> 01:45:28.736
MATT: South.

01:45:28.736 --> 01:45:39.162
LIAM: South. This one says, "The fountain feeds
the garden." Oh, we knew that part. Okay. Let's

01:45:39.162 --> 01:45:41.520
keep looking at the-- okay, what's this one?

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.451
LAURA: Let's go to the next one.

01:45:42.451 --> 01:45:43.393
MATT: Which one do you go to?

01:45:43.393 --> 01:45:44.440
LIAM: Go to the west.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.228
MATT: Western one?

01:45:45.228 --> 01:45:46.306
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.650
MARISHA: West.

01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:50.514
SAM: Need water.

01:45:50.514 --> 01:45:55.566
LIAM: "The garden feeds the warden."

01:45:55.566 --> 01:45:57.852
MARISHA: The garden feeds the warden?

01:45:57.852 --> 01:46:05.142
LIAM: The warden sounds like a sentient-- Ooh, I
feel good.

01:46:05.142 --> 01:46:06.985
LAURA: Go to the 'nother one!

01:46:06.985 --> 01:46:08.882
SAM: The 'nother one?

01:46:08.882 --> 01:46:12.239
LIAM: I always know which way north is, so let's
go east.

01:46:12.239 --> 01:46:16.345
MARISHA: East, south, west, east.

01:46:16.345 --> 01:46:23.854
LIAM: Oh, this is like a chain and if I wasn't
high as fuck I would get it. "The sacrifice feeds

01:46:23.854 --> 01:46:24.919
"the fountain."

01:46:24.919 --> 01:46:26.125
LAURA: Yeah, that's the top thing.

01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:32.605
LIAM: <i>Ja</i> so this is Part A of the equation.
Feeds the fountain. The fountain feeds the garden.

01:46:32.605 --> 01:46:42.915
The garden feeds the warden. The warden feeds the
snakes! Let's go to the last wall. "The warden

01:46:42.915 --> 01:46:46.674
"guards the false serpent."

01:46:46.674 --> 01:46:48.237
TRAVIS and SAM: The what?

01:46:48.237 --> 01:46:49.876
LIAM: False serpent.

01:46:49.876 --> 01:46:52.240
LAURA: The warden guards the false serpent.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:55.747
LIAM: So there is a false serpent that lives here
and we have yet to meet the warden.

01:46:55.747 --> 01:47:00.493
MATT: Avantika just looks straight to you and
goes, "The false serpent."

01:47:00.493 --> 01:47:03.981
TALIESIN: The old serpent.

01:47:03.981 --> 01:47:05.762
MARISHA: What?

01:47:05.762 --> 01:47:08.513
LAURA: The false serpent.

01:47:08.513 --> 01:47:13.381
TALIESIN: I imagine they are speaking of the
previous owner of this temple.

01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:15.739
TRAVIS: Zehir?

01:47:15.739 --> 01:47:19.379
TALIESIN: Probably. Beneath us.

01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:22.044
MARISHA: Why's she looking at you like you know
what she's talking about?

01:47:22.044 --> 01:47:22.989
MATT: "We are close."

01:47:22.989 --> 01:47:24.418
MARISHA: What?

01:47:24.418 --> 01:47:27.497
MATT: What do you wish to do?

01:47:27.497 --> 01:47:31.739
MARISHA: I wish to know what Avantika just fucking
said.

01:47:31.739 --> 01:47:33.546
LAURA: Let's look for the warden.

01:47:33.546 --> 01:47:34.764
TRAVIS: She said we're close.

01:47:34.764 --> 01:47:36.431
TALIESIN: We are the warden right now.

01:47:36.431 --> 01:47:38.434
MARISHA: We're close?

01:47:38.434 --> 01:47:40.357
TALIESIN: We've got two wardens.

01:47:40.357 --> 01:47:43.996
LAURA: Oh. You guys are the wardens.

01:47:43.996 --> 01:47:45.927
SAM: I'm the warden?

01:47:45.927 --> 01:47:47.865
TALIESIN: This is what I'm estimating--

01:47:47.865 --> 01:47:49.898
LAURA: You guys are the wardens!

01:47:49.898 --> 01:47:52.775
SAM: I don't feel wardeny.

01:47:52.775 --> 01:47:54.862
TRAVIS: Jester, I don't think anyone is the
warden.

01:47:54.862 --> 01:47:57.259
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look--

01:47:57.259 --> 01:47:59.116
LIAM: I think we have yet to meet the warden.

01:47:59.116 --> 01:48:01.193
TRAVIS: Oh--

01:48:01.193 --> 01:48:07.607
MATT: There's a strange moment as, Nott-- this
cold sensation on your back. You're like, "Oh,

01:48:07.607 --> 01:48:15.141
"that kind of tickles." It begins to constrict and
you guys glance over and one of the vines is

01:48:15.141 --> 01:48:19.117
curled up around Nott and begins to tighten around
it.

01:48:19.117 --> 01:48:22.502
LAURA: Oh no! Get Caleb off the ground!

01:48:22.502 --> 01:48:26.233
SAM: It feels like there's a vine around me, but I
know it's not real.

01:48:26.233 --> 01:48:28.626
MATT: You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and
are grappled.

01:48:28.626 --> 01:48:30.229
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! Yasha runs over--

01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:31.559
MATT: You are restrained.

01:48:31.559 --> 01:48:33.524
LAURA: I lift Caleb off the ground because I'm
next to Caleb still.

01:48:33.524 --> 01:48:34.623
LIAM: Oh!

01:48:34.623 --> 01:48:35.503
MATT: All right.

01:48:35.503 --> 01:48:37.645
TRAVIS: Yasha runs over to Nott and with the--

01:48:37.645 --> 01:48:39.470
MATT: Go for it. Yasha goes in, takes two swings.

01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:41.014
LIAM: You're hurting my ribs.

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.749
TRAVIS: Reckless on el vine.

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:48.368
MATT: You got it. You hold him up at which point a
vine wraps up around your body, Jester. That is a

01:48:48.368 --> 01:48:50.273
16 to hit.

01:48:50.273 --> 01:48:51.858
LAURA: Doesn't hit me!

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.788
MATT: You kick it off and pull away. You can now
see this--

01:48:53.788 --> 01:48:56.106
LAURA: I am walking around so the vines don't get
me.

01:48:56.106 --> 01:49:00.780
MATT: This thick vine that is rising up and it
curls around, snake-like in its own right, towards

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:05.499
you. Other vines begin to thicken in the area
around you and the roots begin to turn the area

01:49:05.499 --> 01:49:09.731
into hard terrain to walk through. The floor of
the forest seems to briefly come alive and you now

01:49:09.731 --> 01:49:14.231
see these large two thick, entangling vines, one
that's wrapped entirely around Nott and

01:49:14.231 --> 01:49:19.104
constricting her tiny body. The other one trying
to wrap its way around Jester.

01:49:19.104 --> 01:49:21.434
TRAVIS: Her first strike was 21. Second one was
14.

01:49:21.434 --> 01:49:23.655
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

01:49:25.968 --> 01:49:36.912
TRAVIS: That's nine points of damage on the first
one. 12 points of damage on the second one.

01:49:36.912 --> 01:49:42.219
MATT: 12 points of damage on the second one. You
can now see as this is happening-- Who wants to

01:49:42.219 --> 01:49:44.002
take action on this one?

01:49:44.002 --> 01:49:47.851
MARISHA: I'll do something and I'll say: Caduceus,
can you talk to them?

01:49:47.851 --> 01:49:55.239
TALIESIN: You're making a terrible mistake. Stop.
Please?

01:49:55.239 --> 01:50:06.504
MARISHA: You're always so convincing except for
now! I pummel on the ones-- Jester saved Nott? Or

01:50:06.504 --> 01:50:07.434
is Nott still--

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:08.359
MATT: No, Nott's still being constricted.

01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:11.009
TRAVIS: Oh, it's still there. It didn't cut
through it?

01:50:11.009 --> 01:50:12.070
MATT: Yeah. No.

01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:13.123
TRAVIS: Oh wow!

01:50:13.123 --> 01:50:14.181
LAURA: What didn't cut through?

01:50:14.181 --> 01:50:16.344
TRAVIS: 20 points of damage.

01:50:16.344 --> 01:50:21.010
MATT: Carved into and cut elements of it. You can
see the vine itself, where it's split open,

01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:27.496
there's a hardy, thick, light green, tendon-like
material beneath. It's a very strong vine. It's

01:50:27.496 --> 01:50:32.234
wrapped around multiple times around Nott now and
it's pulling and trying to squeeze her to death.

01:50:32.234 --> 01:50:34.387
SAM: It's fine.

01:50:34.387 --> 01:50:41.142
MARISHA: Can I wedge my hand in there to try and
give a little bit of breathing room for Nott as I

01:50:41.142 --> 01:50:45.074
punch the vine?

01:50:45.074 --> 01:50:48.778
MATT: You can either attempt to help her escape or
you can attempt to punch the vine. The choice is yours.

01:50:49.028 --> 01:50:51.117
MARISHA: I'll attempt to help Nott escape.

01:50:51.117 --> 01:50:52.691
MATT: All right. This is your action.

01:50:52.691 --> 01:50:53.944
MARISHA: It might be a terrible mistake.

01:50:53.944 --> 01:50:55.037
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:50:55.037 --> 01:51:05.943
MARISHA: Okay. (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil. Fuck
me. Almost every time. Nine!

01:51:05.943 --> 01:51:09.700
MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, it's too strong and as
you try and pull the vines away, they just are

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.303
locked in this death grip around Nott. That ends
your action. Caduceus.

01:51:14.303 --> 01:51:17.207
TALIESIN: Is it wet in here or is it dry in here,
would you say?

01:51:17.207 --> 01:51:25.786
MATT: It's fairly damp. It's not super moist, but
there is a general hint of humidity in the air.

01:51:25.786 --> 01:51:29.717
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity--

01:51:29.717 --> 01:51:33.799
MATT: While this is happening, Nott, what are you
doing?

01:51:33.799 --> 01:51:39.810
SAM: I am trying to cast Teleport. I do not have
Teleport.

01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:40.987
MATT: No.

01:51:40.987 --> 01:51:42.426
SAM: I'm trying it anyway.

01:51:42.426 --> 01:51:49.314
MATT: You're just focusing. Action spent willing
yourself somewhere else. Make a constitution

01:51:49.314 --> 01:51:51.829
saving throw.

01:51:51.829 --> 01:51:54.827
SAM: Okay. Con save, 18.

01:51:54.827 --> 01:52:00.437
MATT: 18. All right. You don't pop a blood vessel
in your eye, but it gets close.

01:52:00.437 --> 01:52:02.475
SAM: I think it worked!

01:52:02.475 --> 01:52:06.835
TALIESIN: Can I use Create or Destroy Water to try
and dehydrate these vines really badly?

01:52:06.835 --> 01:52:08.435
MATT: You can--

01:52:08.435 --> 01:52:09.902
MATT and TALIESIN: -- certainly try.

01:52:09.902 --> 01:52:14.936
TALIESIN: I am going to cast Create or Destroy
Water and try and dehydrate as much of the tree

01:52:14.936 --> 01:52:23.396
and see if that-- While I make my way to some
higher ground.

01:52:23.396 --> 01:52:27.918
SAM: Remember, Laura, you do have a weasel around
your neck.

01:52:27.918 --> 01:52:29.611
LAURA: Good point.

01:52:29.611 --> 01:52:37.971
MATT: Okay. You manage to disperse a lot of the
moisture in the air, but you cannot pull it from a creature.

01:52:37.999 --> 01:52:40.296
TALIESIN: Okay. Can't pull it from a creature.

01:52:40.296 --> 01:52:41.467
MATT: You would know that with the spell.

01:52:41.467 --> 01:52:48.323
TALIESIN: I would know that? Okay. I'm going to
try and-- god, the only thing I can think to do at

01:52:48.323 --> 01:52:57.187
the moment is just do a Sacred Flame to try and
get it to let go while I make my way to higher

01:52:57.187 --> 01:53:00.840
ground because maybe we need to give it blood. I
don't know.

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.351
MATT: All right. It fails its save. Roll damage.
Caleb, what are you doing? You're being held up by

01:53:04.351 --> 01:53:05.516
Jester right now.

01:53:05.516 --> 01:53:08.497
LIAM: I can tell that things are going very poorly
so I reach into my pockets and I pull out a bit of

01:53:08.497 --> 01:53:14.081
iron dust and I go (blowing) and Jester doubles in
size.

01:53:14.081 --> 01:53:16.597
TRAVIS: Oh tall Jester!

01:53:16.597 --> 01:53:19.571
MATT: Now giant Jester is holding Caleb over your
shoulder.

01:53:19.571 --> 01:53:21.825
LIAM: Hey! Oh.

01:53:21.825 --> 01:53:23.122
TALIESIN: 11.

01:53:23.122 --> 01:53:24.471
MATT: 11 points of damage. All right.

01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:27.592
LIAM: You get advantage on strength checks and
strength saves right now, so you can bust if

01:53:27.592 --> 01:53:29.008
you're grappled.

01:53:29.008 --> 01:53:33.085
MATT: That ends your go. Caleb casts Enlarge on
giant Jester. Fjord, what are you doing?

01:53:33.085 --> 01:53:36.481
TRAVIS: Can I run over to the basket that was
tipped over?

01:53:36.481 --> 01:53:37.453
MATT: Yeah.

01:53:37.453 --> 01:53:39.265
TRAVIS: Can I run over and grab it and pick it up
and look at it?

01:53:39.265 --> 01:53:42.207
MATT: Sure. You grab it and pick it up and look at
it. It looks like on the inside it had some

01:53:42.207 --> 01:53:47.704
elements of remnants of fruit that may have
scuffed part of the wicker, but other than that it

01:53:47.704 --> 01:53:49.250
just looks like a basket.

01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:55.573
TRAVIS: Fuck. I'll just fire two blasts of
Eldritch Blast at the vine that's holding Nott.

01:53:55.573 --> 01:53:57.884
MATT: Well, you'll get to that next round because
it takes your action to lift up the basket and

01:53:57.884 --> 01:53:59.191
inspect it.

01:53:59.191 --> 01:54:00.019
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:54:00.019 --> 01:54:04.203
MATT: That's okay. That ends your turn. Now, the
vines. The one that constricts once again to you,

01:54:04.203 --> 01:54:11.559
Nott. As it's pulling you in, you feel now these
thorns emerge from the inside of its constriction

01:54:11.559 --> 01:54:17.591
and poison bursts into your system. You take--

01:54:17.591 --> 01:54:21.712
LAURA: Did I get to do an action on that last
one?

01:54:21.712 --> 01:54:23.125
MATT: 23 points of poison damage.

01:54:23.125 --> 01:54:25.192
SAM: 23? Nice.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:27.742
MATT: Yes. Your action was lifting Caleb up off
the ground.

01:54:27.742 --> 01:54:29.470
TRAVIS: Only you can start a forest fire.

01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:35.161
MATT: The other one will attempt to constrict you
again. That is a 14 to hit.

01:54:35.161 --> 01:54:36.210
LAURA: No.

01:54:36.210 --> 01:54:42.545
MATT: With that, you kick it off with your giant
foot. The vine pulls itself back up. Now you can go.

01:54:42.688 --> 01:54:52.787
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians.
Can I walk over to where Nott is? I'm going to

01:54:52.787 --> 01:55:00.820
cast Spirit Guardians and anything that enters
that space has to make a wisdom saving throw or

01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:03.887
take 3d8 radiant damage.

01:55:03.887 --> 01:55:05.567
MATT: What's the DC on that?

01:55:05.567 --> 01:55:07.263
LAURA: Wisdom save of 15.

01:55:07.263 --> 01:55:10.669
MATT: Three and 13. They both fail. Roll 3d6
damage and they both take it.

01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:12.676
SAM: These are creatures?

01:55:12.676 --> 01:55:18.012
LAURA: This is the vines that are attacking you
and if I'm close by anything that's attacking me, too.

01:55:18.156 --> 01:55:21.018
MATT: You're close enough to the vine that is
trying to attack you, yeah.

01:55:21.018 --> 01:55:27.893
LAURA: Okay. 11 points of radiant damage. No, 3d8!
Those are 3d6. Hold on. I rolled wrong.

01:55:27.893 --> 01:55:31.034
TRAVIS: Please be more than 18.

01:55:31.034 --> 01:55:33.402
LAURA: Ooh, that's better. 15.

01:55:33.402 --> 01:55:37.029
MATT: 15 points of radiant damage to each. The
vine that was constricting around you hadn't taken

01:55:37.029 --> 01:55:41.965
any damage yet. You see a burst of radiant energy.
You watch as it lights up the area briefly. The

01:55:41.965 --> 01:55:45.566
one that's currently burning around there, the
radiant damage burns past. You can see part of it

01:55:45.566 --> 01:55:50.286
blacken from the impact of the radiant energy, but
it's still holding Nott tight. That ends your go.

01:55:50.286 --> 01:55:52.405
Yasha. What's Yasha doing?

01:55:52.432 --> 01:56:01.593
TRAVIS: Fuck. Yeah. Yasha would like to fucking
<i>ragé</i> and she will take-- to <i>ragé.</i> Take two

01:56:01.593 --> 01:56:06.157
strikes using Divine Fury while she's raging of
radiant damage towards--

01:56:06.157 --> 01:56:07.834
MATT: Go for it.

01:56:07.834 --> 01:56:10.948
TRAVIS: Reckless. That's 20 for the first one.

01:56:10.948 --> 01:56:11.905
MATT: That hits.

01:56:11.905 --> 01:56:14.580
TRAVIS: Second one is 23.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.459
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage. Still tearing into
that same vine that's holding Nott.

01:56:19.459 --> 01:56:26.054
TRAVIS: 19 points with radiant damage on the end
of that.

01:56:26.054 --> 01:56:31.204
MATT: Correct. Damage on the second strike? 2d6
plus five. Weirdly cocked.

01:56:31.204 --> 01:56:33.705
TRAVIS: 11 points of damage.

01:56:33.705 --> 01:56:37.613
MATT: 11 points of damage. Hacking through that
vine. It's still holding Nott, but it is looking

01:56:37.613 --> 01:56:43.201
really rough. It's on the edge of keeping itself
held together and you can see the parts of where

01:56:43.201 --> 01:56:47.329
Yasha's carved through and where the radiant
energy has blasted it. It's starting to leak this

01:56:47.329 --> 01:56:49.835
thick, green sap. It's having a hard time.

01:56:49.835 --> 01:56:51.268
TRAVIS: Thick, green sap?

01:56:51.268 --> 01:56:53.342
MATT: Yeah, it's a plant bleeding. If you've ever
seen a plant bleed.

01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:55.580
MARISHA: It's a Green Day cover band.

01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.612
MATT: There you go. Beau.

01:56:57.612 --> 01:57:02.183
MARISHA: Okay. Shit. We didn't roll initiative.
Nott's still stuck?

01:57:02.183 --> 01:57:06.077
MATT: Yeah, Nott's still stuck. Though the vine
around Nott is hurt pretty bad.

01:57:06.077 --> 01:57:08.554
TRAVIS: The vine that was holding her was the one
that Caleb exploded.

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:14.825
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to take my staff and
where Jester already put in holes, I'm going to

01:57:14.825 --> 01:57:17.452
(grunting).

01:57:17.452 --> 01:57:22.579
MATT: Go for it. The one that's around Nott or the
one that's after Jester?

01:57:22.579 --> 01:57:24.515
MARISHA: Nott. Nott?

01:57:24.515 --> 01:57:26.089
MATT: The one that's around Nott or the one that's
after Jester?

01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:27.016
MARISHA: Nott!

01:57:27.016 --> 01:57:28.467
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:57:28.467 --> 01:57:29.944
MARISHA: I didn't know about the one after Jester.
I'm sorry.

01:57:29.944 --> 01:57:30.791
LAURA: No, I'm good.

01:57:30.791 --> 01:57:32.700
MARISHA: Okay. The first one is 22.

01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.491
MATT: That hits.

01:57:34.491 --> 01:57:40.588
MARISHA: Oh it's staff. Staff magic. Ten!

01:57:40.588 --> 01:57:43.349
MATT: Ten points of damage. All righty.

01:57:43.349 --> 01:57:47.937
MARISHA: Second attack. Not as good. 12.

01:57:47.937 --> 01:57:53.587
MATT: 12 misses. You swing the second hit with the
staff and as you do, the vine arcs out of the way

01:57:53.587 --> 01:57:55.607
and it hits air.

01:57:55.607 --> 01:57:56.710
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:57:56.710 --> 01:58:04.288
MARISHA: And bonus attack. Bad. Bad-ish. 13.

01:58:04.288 --> 01:58:05.620
MATT: 13 just hits.

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:07.441
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:58:07.441 --> 01:58:08.883
SAM: Bad-ish.

01:58:08.883 --> 01:58:10.588
TALIESIN: Bad-esque.

01:58:10.588 --> 01:58:15.057
MARISHA: Eight damage.

01:58:15.057 --> 01:58:17.933
MATT: At this point, I also need you to make a
strength saving throw.

01:58:17.933 --> 01:58:18.627
MARISHA: Me?

01:58:18.627 --> 01:58:20.208
MATT: Yep.

01:58:20.208 --> 01:58:21.819
MARISHA: Because I'm attacking?

01:58:21.819 --> 01:58:26.332
MATT: Now that you've moved in, the vines in the
area begin to entangle and move around.

01:58:26.332 --> 01:58:29.685
MARISHA: Okay. 14.

01:58:29.685 --> 01:58:34.580
MATT: You manage to push off of the vines on the
ground around you that are trying to entangle and

01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:38.324
hold your legs to the ground. Jester, I need you
to also make a strength saving throw.

01:58:38.324 --> 01:58:40.239
LIAM: At advantage because of Enlarge.

01:58:40.239 --> 01:58:41.585
MATT: Yes.

01:58:41.585 --> 01:58:43.023
LAURA: Oh, that's--

01:58:43.023 --> 01:58:44.343
SAM: Damn!

01:58:44.343 --> 01:58:45.739
TALIESIN: Hulk smash.

01:58:45.739 --> 01:58:47.078
LAURA: 22.

01:58:47.078 --> 01:58:48.996
MATT: No issue. You just kick out of the vines
without problem.

01:58:48.996 --> 01:58:51.531
LIAM: Yeah. Technically.

01:58:51.531 --> 01:58:55.212
LAURA: Technically-- you suck, vines.

01:58:55.212 --> 01:59:01.448
MATT: That brings us to Nott. On the top of your
turn, as you are still constricted, you take

01:59:01.448 --> 01:59:08.462
another 19 points of poison damage.

01:59:08.462 --> 01:59:10.124
SAM: I'm out.

01:59:10.124 --> 01:59:11.085
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:59:11.085 --> 01:59:16.846
MATT: Nott goes unconscious and you watch the
vines closing entirely around her face and torso,

01:59:16.846 --> 01:59:25.342
just the arm poking out of the side. You can now
see as the lighter green skin tone get darker with

01:59:25.342 --> 01:59:32.302
blood now being pushed towards the outer sides of
her limbs. At end of your turn, Nott, I need you

01:59:32.302 --> 01:59:34.362
to make a death saving throw.

01:59:34.362 --> 01:59:35.982
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:59:35.982 --> 01:59:37.187
SAM: 16?

01:59:37.187 --> 01:59:42.191
MATT: That's a success. All right. Caduceus.

01:59:42.191 --> 01:59:59.435
TALIESIN: I can sometimes influence plants. I'm
going to try and get them to stop.

01:59:59.435 --> 02:00:00.856
MATT: You're going to attempt to--

02:00:00.856 --> 02:00:03.256
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to tell the trees to
stop.

02:00:05.019 --> 02:00:09.370
MATT: Okay. What are you saying?

02:00:09.370 --> 02:00:14.011
TALIESIN: We're not here for you. Let go and stop
this, or I can't be held responsible for what

02:00:14.011 --> 02:00:18.232
happens to this place. Do not join the cycle of
life and death here.

02:00:18.232 --> 02:00:23.634
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:00:23.634 --> 02:00:25.446
TALIESIN: Do I get advantage?

02:00:25.446 --> 02:00:26.876
LAURA: Trees and vines.

02:00:26.876 --> 02:00:28.694
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're mean, though.

02:00:28.694 --> 02:00:29.986
TALIESIN: An intimidation check?

02:00:29.986 --> 02:00:31.804
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:00:31.804 --> 02:00:39.489
TALIESIN: All right. No. Wow, that's a terrible
roll-- and a terrible roll. Seven. No, no, eight.

02:00:39.634 --> 02:00:41.320
MATT: Oh, buddy.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:47.062
TALIESIN: That's okay! I'm going to use my bonus
to cast Spare the Dying anyway on Nott. You're stabilized.

02:00:47.062 --> 02:00:49.448
MATT: Okay, there you go. You no longer have to
roll death saving throws.

02:00:49.448 --> 02:00:51.051
SAM: Great.

02:00:51.051 --> 02:00:55.549
MATT: It can still constrict you, but... All
right, so that ends your turn. Unfortunately, your

02:00:55.549 --> 02:00:59.379
cries fall on deaf ears as it appears the hunger
that drives these vines overrides the

02:00:59.379 --> 02:01:03.184
communication you're attempting to spring with
them. That opportunity may have worked, but not

02:01:03.184 --> 02:01:04.370
this time!

02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:05.075
TALIESIN: Darn it.

02:01:05.075 --> 02:01:07.699
MATT: All right, finishing your go. Now --

02:01:07.699 --> 02:01:08.998
TRAVIS: Fjord hasn't gone.

02:01:08.998 --> 02:01:14.240
MATT: That's right, Jester and-- well, no, you
cast Spirit Guardians this turn, right? Last turn?

02:01:14.549 --> 02:01:15.871
TALIESIN: Last turn.

02:01:15.871 --> 02:01:17.310
LAURA: I have no idea what turn is what.

02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:18.520
MATT: I know, I'm trying to keep in my head
here--

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:19.468
SAM: It's the top of this round.

02:01:19.468 --> 02:01:20.776
TRAVIS: Have you taken two turns since--

02:01:20.776 --> 02:01:23.396
MATT: She did. She lifted up Caleb the first time,
the second time you cast Spirit Guardians. Now

02:01:23.396 --> 02:01:25.645
we're going to Caleb and Fjord. Fjord, what are
you doing?

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:28.376
LAURA: --there are little pocket unicorns dancing
around. I just wanted you to know.

02:01:28.376 --> 02:01:29.565
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:01:29.565 --> 02:01:30.523
MARISHA: Ooh!

02:01:30.523 --> 02:01:32.381
MATT: There you go. Dancing and spearing with
their little horns.

02:01:32.381 --> 02:01:33.996
MARISHA: Return of the fucking unicorns!

02:01:33.996 --> 02:01:37.019
TRAVIS: Because the basket didn't do anything,
I'll summon the falchion and I will run towards

02:01:37.019 --> 02:01:38.684
the vine.

02:01:38.684 --> 02:01:40.996
MATT: All right. Roll a strength saving throw to
see if you can manage to break through the

02:01:40.996 --> 02:01:43.388
entangling vines to get towards it.

02:01:45.533 --> 02:01:47.623
TRAVIS: That's not good, though. Oh, good, natural
16.

02:01:47.623 --> 02:01:51.000
MATT: You feel them pull at your shins but you
still kick through and you hear them snap as you

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.780
manage to brush past their grip making your way
towards-- which one, the one that has Nott?

02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.448
TRAVIS: Yeah, the one that has Nott.

02:01:56.448 --> 02:01:57.781
MATT: Go ahead and make your first attack.

02:01:57.781 --> 02:02:02.366
TRAVIS: Yeah. As I'm arcing down and I look out
the side, is the eye doing anything?

02:02:02.366 --> 02:02:03.810
MATT: It's present.

02:02:03.810 --> 02:02:07.999
TRAVIS: Cool, it's there, good deal. 23.

02:02:07.999 --> 02:02:10.861
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:02:10.861 --> 02:02:13.284
LAURA: (posh accent) 23.

02:02:13.284 --> 02:02:14.981
TRAVIS: (posh accent) Would you shut up?

02:02:14.981 --> 02:02:16.073
(laughter)

02:02:16.073 --> 02:02:17.273
TRAVIS: Aw, fuck. Five points of damage.

02:02:17.273 --> 02:02:22.272
MATT: Five points of damage. You carve through the
vine-- Bisecting it. You watch as now, looking as

02:02:22.272 --> 02:02:28.778
you get close up, you can see the base of it now.
This slowly shambling chunk of rooted plant. As

02:02:28.778 --> 02:02:33.024
you run forward, your blade arcing through the
air, you cut through the base of it. The actual

02:02:33.024 --> 02:02:38.011
vine falls limp and uncurls, Nott's body falling
to the ground unconscious. That vine is destroyed.

02:02:38.263 --> 02:02:39.904
MARISHA: Yay!

02:02:39.904 --> 02:02:42.984
LAURA: Get her off the ground! Get her off the
ground! As I spit on him.

02:02:42.984 --> 02:02:45.250
MATT: You still have another attack, and there's
the other vine still trying to wrap around Jester.

02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:47.630
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I'll take the other one.

02:02:47.630 --> 02:02:49.502
MATT: All right, you move up to strike that one.

02:02:49.502 --> 02:02:51.514
TRAVIS: Yes, please. Oh, that's not going to do
it. Nine.

02:02:51.514 --> 02:02:52.568
MATT: Nine misses, unfortunately.

02:02:52.568 --> 02:02:53.539
MARISHA: Nine!

02:02:53.539 --> 02:02:55.607
MATT: All right, that finishes your go. Caleb!

02:02:55.607 --> 02:02:58.626
LIAM: There is vines on Jester down below,
correct?

02:02:58.626 --> 02:02:59.675
MATT: Correct.

02:02:59.675 --> 02:03:02.725
LAURA: Oh, wait, but they should've taken damage
on my turn again.

02:03:02.725 --> 02:03:04.872
MATT: Correct-- on your turn or their turn?

02:03:04.872 --> 02:03:06.289
LAURA: On their turn again.

02:03:06.289 --> 02:03:08.901
MATT: Their turn's coming up. They forgot to keep
that up last time.

02:03:08.901 --> 02:03:13.753
LIAM: I'm just sort of being shaken back and forth
by the blue giant and I'm going to-- I'm super

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:19.621
high!-- throw a Fireball down at the vines below.
Simple spell.

02:03:19.621 --> 02:03:20.940
MATT: Okay.

02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:21.880
TRAVIS: Fire<i>bolt</i>.

02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.177
LIAM: Bolt. Not ball.

02:03:23.177 --> 02:03:25.250
MATT: Bolt! Okay. I was like-- All right.

02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:26.428
LIAM: I don't have Fireball.

02:03:26.428 --> 02:03:27.757
LAURA: (imitating death scream)

02:03:27.757 --> 02:03:28.875
TRAVIS: I saw you were going--

02:03:28.875 --> 02:03:29.976
LIAM: (combustion)

02:03:29.976 --> 02:03:30.837
LAURA: Thanks a lot Caleb!

02:03:30.837 --> 02:03:36.605
LIAM: That is a 25 to hit.

02:03:36.605 --> 02:03:39.258
MATT: 25 to hit, that definitely hits.

02:03:39.258 --> 02:03:42.250
TRAVIS: Like Independence Day. "They're opening
up!" (explosion)

02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:43.858
MATT: Basically.

02:03:43.858 --> 02:03:45.164
MARISHA: Just raving.

02:03:45.164 --> 02:03:47.979
LIAM: But it's just one, so I was scared to go too
big, and I just go (small zap).

02:03:47.979 --> 02:03:50.036
MATT: It should be-- how'd you get a one if it's
2d10?

02:03:50.036 --> 02:03:51.217
LIAM: It's <i>2</i>d10?

02:03:51.217 --> 02:03:52.408
MATT: At level five, you're--

02:03:52.408 --> 02:03:53.749
LIAM: Oh, level five, thank you!

02:03:53.749 --> 02:03:54.839
TRAVIS: Damn, 2d10?

02:03:54.839 --> 02:03:56.048
LIAM: Oh, now it's three.

02:03:56.048 --> 02:03:57.644
MARISHA: Aww.

02:03:57.644 --> 02:03:59.603
MATT: Three damage to it. That ends Caleb's go.

02:03:59.603 --> 02:04:02.400
LIAM: (panicky drug trip groan)

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.011
MATT: All right. Now both of them are going to
attempt-- the one's dead, the other one fails its

02:04:06.011 --> 02:04:08.376
save, so go ahead and roll that one.

02:04:08.376 --> 02:04:10.553
SAM and LAURA: --yeah yeah yeah!

02:04:10.553 --> 02:04:13.361
TRAVIS: Ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out.

02:04:13.361 --> 02:04:15.925
SAM: (singing) Check, check, check, check it
out--

02:04:15.925 --> 02:04:17.643
LAURA: 14 damage!

02:04:17.643 --> 02:04:21.507
MATT: 14 damage, nice. It's going to go ahead and
attempt-- it's now moving away from you and moving

02:04:21.507 --> 02:04:25.418
over towards Fjord. That is going to roll a 17 to
hit.

02:04:25.418 --> 02:04:26.951
TRAVIS: That is my armor class.

02:04:26.951 --> 02:04:30.765
MATT: It hits you. It-- (whiplash) wraps around
Fjord, pulls your arms to the side of your body

02:04:30.765 --> 02:04:37.884
and constricts you! You immediately take nine
points of bludgeoning damage, and you are grappled

02:04:37.884 --> 02:04:40.269
and restrained.

02:04:40.269 --> 02:04:41.937
TRAVIS: Okay, okay.

02:04:41.937 --> 02:04:47.170
MATT: All right, that finishes that one's go. That
brings us to-- now Avantika kicks in. Avantika

02:04:47.170 --> 02:04:51.860
pulls out blades and is going to go ahead and
attack the one going after you and goes "Hands off

02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:58.223
"of him!" Hits with both, and then-- natural 20 on
the dagger.

02:04:58.415 --> 02:05:04.175
TRAVIS: The magical elven poison flame hurricane
dagger.

02:05:04.175 --> 02:05:06.086
MARISHA: Double d4!

02:05:06.086 --> 02:05:08.934
LAURA: I feel like you got Avantika on your mug.

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:14.561
MARISHA: Oh yeah, kind of. This was me at the live
show.

02:05:14.561 --> 02:05:19.558
MATT: Avantika just starts eviscerating this vine
with two slaps of the rapier and then one giant

02:05:19.558 --> 02:05:24.688
dagger strike that carves up the side. Looking
pretty hurt! Still holding on, though. That being

02:05:24.688 --> 02:05:30.305
the case, we're going to be back at the top. That
brings us to Yasha, who's next.

02:05:30.305 --> 02:05:35.563
TRAVIS: Yasha will run, clearly disturbed by Fjord
being lifted into the air, and will <i>certainly</i>

02:05:35.563 --> 02:05:37.493
make two reckless attacks.

02:05:37.493 --> 02:05:39.571
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah!

02:05:39.571 --> 02:05:42.187
TRAVIS: She says (flirtily) "Put him down!"

02:05:42.187 --> 02:05:44.574
(laughter)

02:05:44.574 --> 02:05:46.594
SAM: I'm a little confused.

02:05:46.594 --> 02:05:48.051
MATT: Ashley's going to be real happy.

02:05:48.051 --> 02:05:50.211
MARISHA: Yasha, you're just so flirty today.

02:05:50.211 --> 02:05:51.816
TRAVIS: Nine, nine. It's nine.

02:05:51.816 --> 02:05:54.471
SAM: "Put that stud muffin down so I can make out
with him!"

02:05:54.471 --> 02:05:55.691
MATT: Nah, it misses.

02:05:55.691 --> 02:05:57.624
TRAVIS: Second one's a natural 20.

02:05:57.624 --> 02:05:58.842
MATT: Oh, there we go.

02:05:58.842 --> 02:05:59.794
TRAVIS: No Divine--

02:05:59.794 --> 02:06:03.058
MATT: No, for the first hit. The first hit that
hits gets the Divine Fury.

02:06:03.058 --> 02:06:13.298
TRAVIS: Oh, kickass. Okay. (counting)

02:06:13.298 --> 02:06:14.656
MATT: You double the dice on that one.

02:06:14.656 --> 02:06:15.976
TRAVIS: Yep. So 26.

02:06:15.976 --> 02:06:23.225
MATT: 26 points of damage. As Yasha just carves
through, the second strike cutting straight up the

02:06:23.225 --> 02:06:28.046
side, almost freeing you, it's shredded and still
holding on by a thread of its life as it's trying

02:06:28.046 --> 02:06:32.818
to pull you back to wherever it crawled its way
out of, but still standing. That finishes Yasha's

02:06:32.818 --> 02:06:35.222
go. Jester.

02:06:35.222 --> 02:06:40.560
LAURA: I'm going to cast --

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:43.354
MATT: It's barely holding on.

02:06:43.354 --> 02:06:47.309
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Sacred Flame it.

02:06:47.309 --> 02:06:53.677
MATT: All right. It fails with a four on its
wisdom save there. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:06:53.677 --> 02:06:58.549
LAURA: This is radiant damage again! That's five?

02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:59.985
MATT: Five points of damage; how do you want to do
this, Jester?

02:06:59.985 --> 02:07:02.930
(cheering)

02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:10.319
LAURA: I say "Put him down!" Just like Yasha, I
echo Yasha. Then I radiant damage the vine and

02:07:10.319 --> 02:07:16.755
then I stomp it with my giant feet, and then I
also lift Fjord up onto my other shoulder.

02:07:16.755 --> 02:07:21.705
MATT: Okay, the giant Jester stomping out the vine
on the ground, it's now like-- (splattering) Parts

02:07:21.705 --> 02:07:24.008
of it are being crushed and turned to pulp.

02:07:24.008 --> 02:07:26.714
TRAVIS: Oh, thanks Jester-- (scared moans)

02:07:26.714 --> 02:07:30.419
LAURA: Don't worry, little children.

02:07:30.419 --> 02:07:34.172
TRAVIS: Now am I over your shoulder in, like, the
baby burping pose, or sitting on your shoulder?

02:07:34.172 --> 02:07:38.690
LAURA: You're sitting on my shoulder. Caleb is
draped over the shoulder.

02:07:38.690 --> 02:07:40.845
TALIESIN: Just need to get Nott to higher ground.

02:07:40.845 --> 02:07:42.425
MATT: Caleb is fireman's carry.

02:07:42.425 --> 02:07:43.609
TRAVIS: Got to get Nott on --?

02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:46.688
TALIESIN: To higher ground would be nice. Anywhere
where we can see clearly.

02:07:46.688 --> 02:07:49.448
LIAM: Quickly! Before this runs out.

02:07:49.448 --> 02:07:51.962
LAURA: We need to heal. Heal Nott, heal Nott!

02:07:51.962 --> 02:07:56.085
TALIESIN: I just-- do we know where we're going
yet?

02:07:56.085 --> 02:07:58.604
TRAVIS: I think down, but I don't know how to get
there.

02:07:58.604 --> 02:08:02.222
MARISHA: I run over and I pick up Nott and I--

02:08:02.222 --> 02:08:07.932
TALIESIN: Are we still being attacked by these
things?

02:08:07.932 --> 02:08:09.595
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:08:09.595 --> 02:08:11.340
TALIESIN: (sarcastically) Happily.

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:13.671
SAM and MARISHA: (vocalizing intro to <i>The Lion
King</i>)

02:08:13.671 --> 02:08:15.978
MATT: Jamedi's still holding the torch up to give
you a good range of light.

02:08:15.978 --> 02:08:16.948
TALIESIN: 20.

02:08:16.948 --> 02:08:21.209
MATT: Looking around you, you can see where the
two clusters of these weird vine creatures were,

02:08:21.353 --> 02:08:28.430
these assassin-type vines. You see there's just
two of them, and glancing about the chamber and

02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:33.803
giving a good solid look, you don't see any more
of that type. It looks like these two were the

02:08:33.803 --> 02:08:38.049
ones that were rooted here either as protector or
had just woven their way down here and became part

02:08:38.049 --> 02:08:41.439
of the ecosystem. But at the moment, you don't see
any other threat.

02:08:41.439 --> 02:08:45.544
TALIESIN: Are we taking ten minutes, or are we
just moving on now?

02:08:45.544 --> 02:08:47.172
TRAVIS: We should move now, right?

02:08:47.172 --> 02:08:48.124
MARISHA: We should move.

02:08:48.124 --> 02:08:51.296
TALIESIN: Well, all right then. I'm going to just
pull a little energy out of the crystal and I'm

02:08:51.296 --> 02:08:55.929
going to tap Nott on the forehead and cast Cure
Wounds at level three.

02:08:55.929 --> 02:08:57.363
MATT: All right.

02:08:57.363 --> 02:08:58.917
TALIESIN: You have 30 hit points.

02:08:58.917 --> 02:09:00.849
SAM: Whoa, that's tons.

02:09:00.849 --> 02:09:04.170
LIAM: Also, Enlarge runs out and we crash on top
of Jester.

02:09:04.170 --> 02:09:05.137
LAURA: How long does it last?

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:06.004
LIAM: One minute.

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.818
LAURA: (brief exertion)

02:09:07.818 --> 02:09:11.551
MATT: Both Fjord and Caleb (crash) onto the
ground, tumbling onto your sides.

02:09:11.551 --> 02:09:13.176
TRAVIS: Sorry, Jester.

02:09:13.176 --> 02:09:17.056
LAURA: No, I'm sorry-- that you weren't protected
earlier.

02:09:17.056 --> 02:09:18.854
TRAVIS: You all right?

02:09:18.854 --> 02:09:21.417
LAURA: I'm good, thank you for asking.

02:09:21.417 --> 02:09:22.748
TALIESIN: That's good to know, too.

02:09:22.748 --> 02:09:32.186
SAM: (panting) That... was... amazing. I would do
it again in a second. Holy shit. I mean, we used

02:09:32.186 --> 02:09:36.044
to mess around with chemicals, but <i>nothing</i> like
that!

02:09:36.044 --> 02:09:38.477
LAURA: Is he still high? Are you still high? Are
either of you still high?

02:09:38.477 --> 02:09:41.668
MATT: They both very much are. You have no idea
how long this is going to last.

02:09:41.668 --> 02:09:45.568
LAURA: Spiritual unicorns are dancing around you
guys as this is going on.

02:09:45.568 --> 02:09:48.110
SAM: (excited laughter) Did you see that?!

02:09:48.110 --> 02:09:50.180
LAURA: They're like this big!

02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:53.441
SAM: How is my hand as big as yours now?! It
doesn't make any sense!

02:09:53.441 --> 02:09:56.846
LIAM: Ooh. I will turn your hand into gold.

02:09:56.846 --> 02:09:59.925
TALIESIN: I'm going to inspect these two plants.
If there's anything that would have been difficult

02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:05.433
to get to past these two plants. I feel like maybe
those are the-- they might be --

02:10:05.433 --> 02:10:08.438
SAM: Remember that there was those--

02:10:08.438 --> 02:10:13.032
MATT: The only other thing you've seen are the
central slips, the holes in the bottom of those

02:10:13.032 --> 02:10:15.084
three tablets.

02:10:15.084 --> 02:10:18.180
TRAVIS: Let's go look more closely at those.

02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:23.029
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast some-- I'm going to
use my light maybe to give everybody a little view.

02:10:23.171 --> 02:10:25.749
MATT: As you make your way towards some of those
doors, we're going to take a little break.

02:10:25.749 --> 02:10:27.199
(groaning)

02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:30.777
MATT: I just realized we're past nine o'clock.
Take a break here, we'll be back here in a short

02:10:30.777 --> 02:10:36.775
bit to pick up their investigation as to where the
next exit point of this chamber may be. In the

02:10:36.775 --> 02:10:43.525
meantime, guys, we have our giveaway here! We have
a fantastic padauk with ebony dust inlay Halloween

02:10:43.525 --> 02:10:47.087
dice vault. I've not seen this before, it looks
awesome.

02:10:47.087 --> 02:10:48.139
LIAM: That one says--

02:10:48.139 --> 02:10:49.296
MARISHA: Yeah, that one says--

02:10:49.296 --> 02:10:54.117
LIAM: Your toilet guarded by the hemoglobins.

02:10:54.117 --> 02:10:55.897
MARISHA: There's a hole in the bucket.

02:10:55.897 --> 02:10:57.258
TALIESIN: Knee bone connected to the--

02:10:57.258 --> 02:11:00.896
MATT: You can find this available now on
Kickstarter through Halloween, run by our good

02:11:00.896 --> 02:11:05.499
friends at Wyrmwood. This one will be given away
to someone who wins the giveaway, which in order

02:11:05.499 --> 02:11:09.264
to enter you have to come over to the Critical
Role Twitch chat-- that's twitch.tv/criticalrole--

02:11:09.264 --> 02:11:16.247
during the break and enter-- only once!-- the code
word "snakes." Plural. (as Indiana Jones) "Why'd

02:11:16.247 --> 02:11:19.647
it have to be snakes?" We'll have a winner for you
when we come back from the break, and we'll see

02:11:19.647 --> 02:11:21.996
you in a few minutes.

02:11:21.996 --> 02:25:41.226
[break]

02:25:41.498 --> 02:25:49.044
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome back. Our
winner of the fantastic Wyrmwood padauk with ebony

02:25:49.044 --> 02:25:55.397
dust inlay Halloween dice vault from the
Kickstarter is... punypompouspuffball.

02:25:55.397 --> 02:25:57.761
TRAVIS: Trippy!

02:25:57.761 --> 02:25:59.528
LIAM: Wow, that's almost a Matt Mercer callout!

02:25:59.528 --> 02:26:05.427
MATT: Congratulations, punypompouspuffball. We'll
have your Wyrmwood gift sent off to you ASAP.

02:26:05.427 --> 02:26:07.422
Happy Halloween.

02:26:07.422 --> 02:26:09.088
TALIESIN: Posthaste? Possibly?

02:26:09.088 --> 02:26:15.586
MATT: So. Where we left off, Mighty Nein. You
began to go and inspect some of these tablets with

02:26:15.586 --> 02:26:20.358
these gaps beneath the bottom. Which way did you
want to go?

02:26:20.358 --> 02:26:22.585
TRAVIS: Oh, the one that was--

02:26:22.585 --> 02:26:24.397
MARISHA: How big are the gaps?

02:26:24.397 --> 02:26:29.659
MATT: They're about 12 to 14 inches wide, and
about four to five inches tall. Or on the bottom.

02:26:29.659 --> 02:26:33.051
TALIESIN: North.

02:26:33.051 --> 02:26:34.226
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:26:34.226 --> 02:26:36.357
MARISHA: Yeah, because north was--

02:26:36.357 --> 02:26:38.139
TALIESIN: The warden garden.

02:26:38.139 --> 02:26:43.660
MARISHA: The warden. Okay, but hang on. Do we want
to go in, like, order, and start with the fountain

02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:50.720
feeds the garden? Sorry, sorry, sorry, "the
sacrifice feeds the fountain" at east.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:54.146
MATT: All right. There is no tablet or hole in the
east.

02:26:54.146 --> 02:26:55.559
MARISHA: Oh. What about --

02:26:55.559 --> 02:26:57.000
TALIESIN: South?

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.964
MARISHA: Yeah, south. "Fountain feeds the
garden."

02:27:00.964 --> 02:27:05.144
MATT: Okay. Into the south. Who's doing what? Are
you looking through it?

02:27:05.144 --> 02:27:06.354
TALIESIN: I'll take a look.

02:27:06.354 --> 02:27:09.451
MATT: All right. Make a perception check. Are you
doing it with a light source below?

02:27:09.451 --> 02:27:11.818
TALIESIN: Can I --

02:27:11.818 --> 02:27:14.929
LIAM: (intoxicated) Absolutely! (huffs)

02:27:14.929 --> 02:27:17.427
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep some distance to see
if anything snaps at me.

02:27:17.427 --> 02:27:19.294
MATT: Perception check.

02:27:19.294 --> 02:27:25.779
TALIESIN: I've gotten a little jumpy. Not very
good, 15.

02:27:25.779 --> 02:27:34.011
MATT: Glancing inside, you see a hatchery of some
kind. There's a strong smell of fermentation in

02:27:34.011 --> 02:27:42.205
there. A majority of the room seems to be a series
of clusters of roughly one foot tall eggs. They've

02:27:42.205 --> 02:27:48.090
all been placed in various edges there, nestled in
soft dirt and molding fruit.

02:27:48.090 --> 02:27:51.203
SAM: Eggs are always good in D&D.

02:27:51.203 --> 02:27:56.362
TALIESIN: Can I get a sense of the sort of animal
that would've laid--

02:27:56.362 --> 02:27:58.497
MATT: This is the south room, right?

02:27:58.497 --> 02:27:59.942
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is the south-- fountain feeds
the--

02:27:59.942 --> 02:28:04.790
MATT: You also see what appears to be a broken
humanoid corpse, long decomposed, jammed by one of

02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:06.780
the clusters.

02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:08.424
TRAVIS: Is he wearing manacles?

02:28:08.424 --> 02:28:10.314
MATT: No, no manacles.

02:28:10.314 --> 02:28:18.096
TALIESIN: Also, can I figure out being in here, do
we have any idea how those portholes, those four

02:28:18.096 --> 02:28:21.765
portholes up above, would feed into this room?

02:28:21.765 --> 02:28:27.080
MATT: You can look around you. Go ahead and make a
perception check.

02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:29.688
TALIESIN: How healthy does that egg look?

02:28:29.688 --> 02:28:31.836
MATT: Well, there are a number of eggs inside
there.

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:33.486
TALIESIN: They're lizard eggs, aren't they?

02:28:33.486 --> 02:28:36.246
MATT: They look to be somewhat reptilian, yeah.

02:28:36.246 --> 02:28:38.248
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. How healthy-- oh, yeah.

02:28:38.391 --> 02:28:42.685
MATT: I mean, it's hard to tell from this
distance. All you see is the eggs and the body there.

02:28:42.685 --> 02:28:44.218
MARISHA: I assume you're telling us all this,
yeah?

02:28:44.218 --> 02:28:46.619
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's some reptile-- large
reptile eggs in the--

02:28:46.619 --> 02:28:50.311
MATT: They start about four feet into the room,
and the room itself from what you can see down

02:28:50.311 --> 02:28:52.005
there is enclosed.

02:28:52.005 --> 02:28:53.814
TALIESIN: It appears to be a hatchery of some
kind.

02:28:53.814 --> 02:28:58.955
MARISHA: Is this-- "The fountain feeds the
garden." Maybe <i>this</i> isn't the garden that they

02:28:58.955 --> 02:29:00.746
were talking about.

02:29:00.746 --> 02:29:02.567
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll take a look to see if--

02:29:02.567 --> 02:29:03.526
MATT: Go for it.

02:29:03.526 --> 02:29:05.341
TRAVIS: No keyholes, right?

02:29:05.341 --> 02:29:09.331
TALIESIN: God, these are terrible. 14.

02:29:09.331 --> 02:29:21.975
MATT: You do see, in some of the walls about two
feet off the ground similar sized holes that are

02:29:21.975 --> 02:29:26.858
pushed in against where some of the vines and some
of the carvings are that curl upward-- you imagine

02:29:26.858 --> 02:29:36.142
probably meeting with some of the holes above. You
get the sense that perhaps something uses these to

02:29:36.142 --> 02:29:38.670
traverse up and down parts of this temple.

02:29:38.670 --> 02:29:42.584
TALIESIN: It could be where, once the eggs hatch,
they come up, or this is how they get the eggs

02:29:42.584 --> 02:29:47.872
down, this is a nesting area. All right, what's
the west side really quickly?

02:29:47.872 --> 02:29:51.603
MATT: You head to the west one and you go ahead
and look inside, I imagine putting the spheres in

02:29:51.603 --> 02:29:53.746
as well? Make a perception check.

02:29:53.746 --> 02:29:55.696
LIAM: I can feel my hair growing.

02:29:55.696 --> 02:29:57.588
TALIESIN: Oh, that's better. 19.

02:29:57.588 --> 02:30:02.569
MATT: Glancing inside, it's a relatively simple
chamber. From what you can tell, there are

02:30:02.569 --> 02:30:07.488
elements of stonework placed in, but they haven't
been carved, and they are only partially done.

02:30:07.488 --> 02:30:12.545
They've gotten most of the temple finished, and
they haven't quite fully completed their work in

02:30:12.545 --> 02:30:19.149
going over the walls inside. The small chamber is
maybe 15 by ten feet, and while there's no other

02:30:19.149 --> 02:30:28.071
real discerning shapes or details to it, you do
see about ten feet ahead of you. It descends into

02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:30.006
stairs. Ten-foot wide set of stairs.

02:30:30.006 --> 02:30:32.210
LIAM: Is there any writing or anything in there?

02:30:32.339 --> 02:30:37.492
TALIESIN: No, but I think it keeps going down. I
think they just never quite sealed it up.

02:30:37.492 --> 02:30:43.419
MARISHA: Seems like a pretty important entrance. I
don't know why that would be last on their list.

02:30:43.419 --> 02:30:48.901
TALIESIN: They're not expecting problems, and they
don't seem that bright.

02:30:49.021 --> 02:30:53.647
LIAM: They're not-- the warden can take care of
itself?

02:30:53.647 --> 02:30:56.880
TALIESIN: I guess we'll take a quick look at north
just to finish things off?

02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:00.135
MATT: Okay. Make another perception check,
please.

02:31:00.135 --> 02:31:04.221
SAM: Why is everyone yelling?

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:07.052
TALIESIN: 22.

02:31:07.052 --> 02:31:13.629
MATT: This looks to be a sister hatchery room to
the one on the south. This one does not contain a

02:31:13.629 --> 02:31:17.577
body, but just other clusters of eggs.

02:31:17.577 --> 02:31:21.657
TALIESIN: Is it possible to tell if these eggs
might hatch anytime soon, or are they that's left

02:31:21.657 --> 02:31:22.671
of them?

02:31:22.671 --> 02:31:24.054
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:31:24.054 --> 02:31:28.565
TALIESIN: All right. Let's do that. My nature is
terrible, which is ironic. But I rolled a natural

02:31:28.565 --> 02:31:31.504
20, so that should do.

02:31:31.504 --> 02:31:41.200
MATT: With what experience you have with seeing
much smaller snakes and other type creatures in

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:50.902
nature, you're not really fully understanding the
gestation period of yuan-ti. These eggs don't look

02:31:50.902 --> 02:31:56.357
like they're ready to hatch in the next few days
or so. There's still some time before the oldest

02:31:56.357 --> 02:31:59.096
clutches of--

02:31:59.096 --> 02:32:01.958
TALIESIN: Is this true? Both look similar, both
seem--

02:32:01.958 --> 02:32:03.341
MATT: Yeah, I'd say so.

02:32:03.341 --> 02:32:09.236
TALIESIN: There's probably no direct danger
leaving these things untouched for now. I think

02:32:09.236 --> 02:32:16.957
we've found a way down there, at the very least.

02:32:16.957 --> 02:32:19.931
TRAVIS: We found our way into the room, though.

02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:25.129
TALIESIN: How big is the entrance into that
little, unfinished--

02:32:25.129 --> 02:32:30.233
MATT: It's the same five-inch tall, 12, 13 inches
wide space.

02:32:30.233 --> 02:32:34.560
MARISHA: Do the tablets look to be on any hinges
or levers?

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:36.998
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:32:36.998 --> 02:32:40.914
MARISHA: Okay. That's a natural one.

02:32:40.914 --> 02:32:44.858
MATT: You have no idea.

02:32:44.858 --> 02:32:47.262
LAURA: Can I try reaching with my hands and
pulling?

02:32:47.262 --> 02:32:49.138
MATT: Sure. Make a strength check.

02:32:49.138 --> 02:33:01.522
LAURA: No, I'm still big! No, I'm not still big.
(humming) No. 12.

02:33:01.522 --> 02:33:07.238
MATT: It's wide enough. The actual stone tablets
are maybe about three and a half, four inches

02:33:07.238 --> 02:33:11.968
long. You can get your fingers through and pull on
the other side, but it does not budge. At all.

02:33:11.968 --> 02:33:15.323
TALIESIN: Does it seem like it's separating from
the rock, even a little, if I take a look at it

02:33:15.323 --> 02:33:16.900
from the side?

02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:18.987
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:33:18.987 --> 02:33:27.248
TALIESIN: Aw, man. Low intelligence. That's a 13.

02:33:27.248 --> 02:33:35.641
MATT: Okay. It doesn't separate at all, but you do
see each of the tablets. Where they're part of the

02:33:35.641 --> 02:33:42.366
wall, they're actually recessed in as opposed to
placed against it. You can see, a very very faint

02:33:42.366 --> 02:33:48.630
gap where they would probably slide either side to
side based on some mechanism.

02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:51.868
TRAVIS: Nott, you think you can fit under that
gap?

02:33:51.868 --> 02:33:57.018
SAM: Yeah! Course I can! That's a vast cavern down
there.

02:33:57.018 --> 02:33:58.847
TRAVIS: Get going.

02:33:58.847 --> 02:34:00.637
SAM: Okay.

02:34:00.637 --> 02:34:04.032
MATT: (laughter) Which one are you going in?

02:34:04.032 --> 02:34:08.128
SAM: Which one are we near? Which one had the
stairs going down? The stairwells?

02:34:08.128 --> 02:34:10.650
MATT: It's the western one.

02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:12.671
SAM: Yeah.

02:34:12.671 --> 02:34:18.135
MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just to
see if you can squeeze through the space.

02:34:18.135 --> 02:34:21.895
SAM: 14.

02:34:21.895 --> 02:34:28.606
MATT: Your small, goblin form has no real
problem-- you have to rearrange your skull at a

02:34:28.606 --> 02:34:32.773
certain angle to make it through the gap, but you
do manage to make your way through to the opposite

02:34:32.773 --> 02:34:34.649
side of the chamber.

02:34:34.649 --> 02:34:36.004
TRAVIS: What do you see?

02:34:36.004 --> 02:34:37.229
TALIESIN: Throw some light in there.

02:34:37.229 --> 02:34:40.470
SAM: I'll be back in five minutes.

02:34:40.470 --> 02:34:42.626
TRAVIS: No no, what do you see in the room, Nott?

02:34:42.626 --> 02:34:45.226
SAM: Oh. What? I don't know. What do I see?

02:34:45.226 --> 02:34:51.624
MATT: You see the simple chamber. It looks like,
at first, there was unfinished carvings in the

02:34:51.624 --> 02:34:56.374
wall, so it looks like the carvings come to a
completion, and then the rest of it is a solid

02:34:56.374 --> 02:35:03.118
stone interior that stops at a wall on the
opposite end about 15 feet in, and stairs that

02:35:03.118 --> 02:35:08.983
slowly curve down about ten-foot wide, just begin
to go on a wide spiral downward.

02:35:08.983 --> 02:35:12.765
SAM: There's some carvings, and there's a moving
staircase.

02:35:12.765 --> 02:35:14.424
MARISHA: Did you say moving?

02:35:14.424 --> 02:35:16.440
TRAVIS: I think she said moving staircase, yeah.

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:21.013
SAM: It's not moving fast, it's just going back
and forth.

02:35:21.013 --> 02:35:26.391
LIAM: Pressing face against the crack on. Do you
see-- Jester wants to know if you see a switch.

02:35:26.391 --> 02:35:29.250
LAURA: Like a lever, like a switch, or anything.

02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:32.553
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep trying, see if there's
anything that connects to anything.

02:35:32.553 --> 02:35:35.592
LIAM: Do you need a globule or an owl?

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:38.025
SAM: Is there light or any keyholes or any
switches or--?

02:35:38.025 --> 02:35:40.416
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:35:40.416 --> 02:35:45.909
SAM: I'm fascinated by the walls. I rolled a 28.

02:35:45.909 --> 02:36:00.623
MATT: Okay. So. Amongst the right hand carving,
you look within one of the simple portions of a

02:36:00.623 --> 02:36:07.770
pillar or an obelisk as part of this carving that
looks like a similar construct to the city that

02:36:07.770 --> 02:36:14.502
surrounds this temple, but the obelisk itself
appears to protrude from a slight groove from

02:36:14.502 --> 02:36:21.127
behind this actual gap behind the obelisk, and you
reach through and give it a tug. It pulls forward

02:36:21.127 --> 02:36:30.728
about an inch, at which point, the doors-- All
three of the doors open at once, and the fountain

02:36:30.728 --> 02:36:36.669
raises up to close and return to where it was
above.

02:36:36.669 --> 02:36:40.034
SAM: Nope. Didn't find any.

02:36:40.034 --> 02:36:42.470
TRAVIS: Good job, Nott.

02:36:42.470 --> 02:36:45.180
LIAM: Wow. Wow wee wee wow wow.

02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:50.116
TRAVIS: Why don't you hold Jester's hand and we'll
see where these stairs lead?

02:36:50.116 --> 02:36:54.441
TALIESIN: I'll grab a couple of the fruit that
were on the ground and put them in my pocket.

02:36:54.441 --> 02:36:56.862
MATT: You fill a pocket with fruit.

02:36:56.862 --> 02:36:58.798
MARISHA: I do the same.

02:36:58.798 --> 02:37:00.741
LIAM: Are you trying it?

02:37:00.741 --> 02:37:03.780
LAURA: Same. I'm going to take some and put it in
my bag again.

02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:06.002
MATT: Okay. You grab some fruit and put it in your
bag.

02:37:06.002 --> 02:37:10.611
SAM: I'll take some for the road. Just to hold.

02:37:10.611 --> 02:37:16.895
MATT: Jamedi's waiting for all of this to happen.
Avantika isn't immediately visible.

02:37:16.895 --> 02:37:18.610
TRAVIS: Is Nott immediately visible?

02:37:18.610 --> 02:37:19.944
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:37:19.944 --> 02:37:26.140
TRAVIS: Jamedi, where'd your boss go?

02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:33.366
MATT: You can see the southern wall. Avantika is
rushing back towards you. "Well done.

02:37:33.509 --> 02:37:36.876
"Congratulations. Shall we?"

02:37:36.876 --> 02:37:38.862
LAURA: Where were you?

02:37:38.862 --> 02:37:42.100
MATT: "I was inspecting the other chambers as they
opened."

02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:44.322
MARISHA: Did you find anything?

02:37:44.322 --> 02:37:46.593
MATT: "Snakes and a dead body. Huh?"

02:37:46.593 --> 02:37:48.490
MARISHA: Where's the dead body?

02:37:48.490 --> 02:37:50.591
MATT: "There's a corpse in the other chamber."

02:37:50.591 --> 02:37:52.595
MARISHA: Anything good?

02:37:52.595 --> 02:37:54.844
MATT: "Rotted flesh and some bones."

02:37:54.844 --> 02:37:58.329
SAM: You must know all about that!

02:37:58.329 --> 02:38:04.089
MATT: "I've seen a few in my time. Perhaps even
caused a few." She looks at you with a grin.

02:38:04.089 --> 02:38:10.337
(snaps fingers) You watch as this brief burst of
flame (poof) in front.

02:38:10.337 --> 02:38:12.235
SAM: Ah! Ah!

02:38:12.235 --> 02:38:14.226
MATT: "This is going to be so much fun!"

02:38:14.226 --> 02:38:20.802
TRAVIS: Indeed. Captain, I feel like we are having
all the fun ourselves. Perhaps you and your friend

02:38:20.802 --> 02:38:23.978
would like to take the lead this next round.

02:38:23.978 --> 02:38:27.957
MATT: "That was not part of the arrangement. You
are proving your use to me as my companions and

02:38:27.957 --> 02:38:34.971
"part of my team. As the captain of the ship and as
your superior, I tell you what to do, and you do it."

02:38:34.971 --> 02:38:40.211
MARISHA: I mean, we're not on the ship right now,
though. Right? Hard to captain the ship when

02:38:40.211 --> 02:38:44.725
you're a hundred feet underground.

02:38:44.725 --> 02:38:47.346
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, anything could happen right here.

02:38:47.346 --> 02:38:52.224
MATT: "So what, you kill me, then return and my
entire crew just wipes you out as you arrive?"

02:38:52.224 --> 02:38:55.370
TRAVIS: Kill you? My goodness, we were just trying
to offer you a little bit of <i>fun</i> for this next

02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:57.230
stage. We had no problem--

02:38:57.230 --> 02:39:01.375
MATT: "Oh, I can read between the lines quite
strongly there, Fjord. I appreciate that. Look,

02:39:01.375 --> 02:39:09.540
"this is not me trying to impose my will, just
continue the arrangement we made. And I do not

02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:15.497
"feel like taking the lead. No. That is not the
safest route for the captain, eh?"

02:39:15.497 --> 02:39:19.474
MARISHA: Why are you looking at me? Is she
invisible?

02:39:19.474 --> 02:39:20.866
MATT: No, she's visible.

02:39:20.866 --> 02:39:22.157
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:39:22.157 --> 02:39:24.595
TRAVIS: Did you eat that fruit yet?

02:39:25.198 --> 02:39:31.289
LAURA: I wander over and see if there was a
dead body in the other one.

02:39:31.433 --> 02:39:33.912
MATT: Yeah. There's a dead body there.

02:39:33.912 --> 02:39:37.916
TRAVIS: Is there anything missing in the room?

02:39:37.916 --> 02:39:40.439
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:39:43.782 --> 02:39:49.426
LAURA: Whoa, did you see that? That was crazy.
13.

02:39:49.426 --> 02:39:54.720
MATT: Looking around, you see the egg clutches.
You see the body. Not much else in there.

02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:57.636
LAURA: What does the body look like?

02:39:57.636 --> 02:40:09.044
MATT: It looks like a decomposed corpse. Tattered
clothing, broken leather belt, a simple satchel

02:40:09.044 --> 02:40:15.337
hangs open, just rotted and gone. It's been there
for a long time.

02:40:15.337 --> 02:40:17.145
LAURA: Anything in the satchel?

02:40:17.145 --> 02:40:20.912
MATT: You go ahead and scoot down for a look.

02:40:20.912 --> 02:40:28.190
LAURA: Did it look like-- like no way I could tell
if she took anything from the satchel?

02:40:28.190 --> 02:40:29.913
MATT: You have no idea.

02:40:29.913 --> 02:40:34.865
LAURA: She took something from the satchel. I
stomp back to the rest of the group.

02:40:34.865 --> 02:40:38.963
(laughter)

02:40:38.963 --> 02:40:48.283
MATT: She was the first to inspect the body. "So
who is to make their descent? How about you,

02:40:48.283 --> 02:40:53.808
"Captain Tusktooth? Will you choose one of your
subordinates to lead the fray into the

02:40:53.808 --> 02:40:57.062
"subterranean chambers?"

02:40:57.062 --> 02:40:59.772
MARISHA: Okay.

02:40:59.772 --> 02:41:02.414
MATT: "I think she's volunteering, huh?"

02:41:02.414 --> 02:41:05.187
MARISHA: No. That's-- ugh.

02:41:05.187 --> 02:41:09.310
LAURA: Go, Beau! You're so cool! You should lead
it!

02:41:09.310 --> 02:41:11.838
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> let's go unleash the big snake.

02:41:11.838 --> 02:41:17.139
MATT: "That sounds unanimous, then! Beauregard, I
believe is the name that they keep calling you.

02:41:17.139 --> 02:41:21.334
"Please find your way down. We'll be right behind
you."

02:41:21.334 --> 02:41:27.548
MARISHA: Tracy is my middle name. And I walk
downstairs.

02:41:27.548 --> 02:41:29.226
MATT: All right, so what's the marching order?

02:41:29.226 --> 02:41:31.738
TRAVIS: Hey Phillip, look at me real quick.
Phillip!

02:41:31.738 --> 02:41:33.171
SAM: Caleb, he's talking to you!

02:41:33.171 --> 02:41:35.081
LIAM: What, who? Who is?

02:41:35.081 --> 02:41:38.279
TRAVIS: (whistle) Over here. Eyes up. How big are
those--?

02:41:38.279 --> 02:41:39.120
MATT: Pretty big.

02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:42.157
TRAVIS: Fuck. Okay.

02:41:42.157 --> 02:41:45.169
MATT: Beauregard's in front.

02:41:45.169 --> 02:41:47.439
SAM: We've been down here for <i>days!</i>

02:41:47.439 --> 02:41:50.045
(laughter)

02:41:50.045 --> 02:41:57.361
TRAVIS: Maybe we should think about getting them
some coffee or something? Before we have to go

02:41:57.361 --> 02:41:59.555
back down?

02:41:59.555 --> 02:42:01.471
MATT: Who's after Beauregard?

02:42:01.471 --> 02:42:02.174
LAURA: Me.

02:42:02.174 --> 02:42:03.591
MATT: All right, Jester's after Beauregard.

02:42:03.591 --> 02:42:05.038
LIAM: Somebody's dead.

02:42:05.038 --> 02:42:07.033
TALIESIN: Put the high people in the middle,
maybe.

02:42:07.033 --> 02:42:09.340
MATT: Okay, so we'll put Caleb and Nott here.

02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:11.806
LIAM: Fjord and Yasha are the tallest. We put them--
perfect.

02:42:11.806 --> 02:42:13.274
TRAVIS: I'll be in the very back.

02:42:13.274 --> 02:42:16.912
TALIESIN: I'll be in front of you, just so we have
a cleric on either end.

02:42:16.912 --> 02:42:22.359
MATT: All right, and Avantika is going to stay
back with Fjord and Caduceus, and Yasha is going

02:42:22.359 --> 02:42:28.475
to be right in front of you guys. All righty. Are
you descending quietly?

02:42:28.475 --> 02:42:30.099
LAURA: Yes?

02:42:30.099 --> 02:42:33.415
MATT: I need you all to make a stealth check.

02:42:33.415 --> 02:42:35.566
SAM: Do the stonies get disadvantage or anything?

02:42:35.566 --> 02:42:37.113
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:42:37.113 --> 02:42:39.441
LAURA: Beau, I'm going to give you Blessing of the
Trickster right in front of you.

02:42:39.441 --> 02:42:44.665
MARISHA: Which gives me plus-- advantage? I will
take it.

02:42:44.665 --> 02:42:46.823
LIAM: (singing) Natural 20!

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:49.001
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

02:42:49.001 --> 02:42:52.677
LIAM: I need to drop acid <i>all</i> the time!

02:42:52.677 --> 02:42:54.258
MATT: Roll for Yasha, if you don't mind as well.

02:42:54.258 --> 02:42:54.816
TRAVIS: Oh yes.

02:42:54.816 --> 02:42:56.371
MATT: All right. Beau?

02:42:56.371 --> 02:42:57.059
MARISHA: 17.

02:42:57.059 --> 02:42:57.648
SAM: 20.

02:42:57.648 --> 02:42:58.474
LAURA: 15.

02:42:58.474 --> 02:42:59.429
TALIESIN: Five.

02:42:59.429 --> 02:43:02.673
TRAVIS: Holy shit! Yasha rolled a natural 20!

02:43:02.673 --> 02:43:06.416
(cheering)

02:43:06.416 --> 02:43:08.329
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god!

02:43:08.329 --> 02:43:12.560
MATT: While you catch yourself about to stumble
down the stairs, Yasha reaches out and catches you

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.682
and stops you, pulls you back quietly under your
heels, and just pats you on the shoulder and

02:43:16.682 --> 02:43:18.217
continues walking down.

02:43:18.217 --> 02:43:20.034
TRAVIS. Three natural 20s. Thank god.

02:43:20.034 --> 02:43:28.202
MATT: All right. You guys make your way quietly
down the spiraling staircase that descends 20, 40,

02:43:28.202 --> 02:43:39.343
60 feet before you see it begin to open into
another chamber. Jamedi has the torchlight and

02:43:39.478 --> 02:43:46.003
stays back so as to not let any flickering light
pollute into the next room. He gives a nudge into

02:43:46.003 --> 02:43:51.856
that direction, and you can see where the stairway
continues to descend, but there's an area where

02:43:51.856 --> 02:43:57.762
the wall comes to an end. There's an open chamber
lurking on the other side.

02:43:57.762 --> 02:44:01.356
LAURA: This is where the warden lives.

02:44:01.356 --> 02:44:06.826
MATT: Continuing through, Jamedi's staying back,
not wanting to show the torchlight. Who's going

02:44:06.826 --> 02:44:08.657
ahead to--?

02:44:08.657 --> 02:44:12.558
MARISHA: I just peek around the corner with my
goggles on to see if I see anything.

02:44:12.558 --> 02:44:14.167
MATT: I'll show you what you see.

02:44:14.167 --> 02:44:17.691
ALL: (sounds of awe)

02:44:17.691 --> 02:44:19.325
LIAM: Going into a battle high as fuck!

02:44:19.325 --> 02:44:21.233
TALIESIN: Got a brand new map, got a brand new
map!

02:44:21.233 --> 02:44:23.430
TRAVIS: (imitates sounds of drums)

02:44:23.430 --> 02:44:30.782
SAM: Guys, D&D Beyond has partnered with Beadle &
Grimm's to paint my face. Check it out! You get

02:44:30.782 --> 02:44:34.668
$50 off. Dndbeyond.com!

02:44:34.668 --> 02:44:37.095
MARISHA: What's that there?

02:44:37.095 --> 02:44:40.155
SAM: It's a symbol or shape!

02:44:40.155 --> 02:44:44.268
MARISHA: There's a different wallpiece!

02:44:44.268 --> 02:44:48.439
TALIESIN: She doesn't see the other side of it.

02:44:48.439 --> 02:44:58.033
MATT: As you look past the corner on that
staircase, into this chamber, you see these three

02:44:58.033 --> 02:45:03.821
large, load-bearing pillars, intricately carved,
that make their way to the ceiling of this roughly

02:45:03.821 --> 02:45:17.572
60-foot chamber.In the center of it, a pool of
water around a small well, but the entire chamber

02:45:17.572 --> 02:45:27.521
itself is filled with about an inch or two of
water. While it's not a glass surface-- There's a

02:45:27.521 --> 02:45:38.710
slight disturbance to it. There's a slight shift.
A shape that is currently coiled quietly. On this

02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:50.929
end, one of the large, full-bodied snake yuan-ti
that you had encountered briefly in the city

02:45:50.929 --> 02:45:55.584
outside of the temple that had grabbed Jester and
was about to make off with her. You can see the

02:45:55.584 --> 02:46:02.360
15- or 20-foot long serpentlike lower part of the
body where there are no legs-- just this long

02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:09.723
snake-- that coils around. The muscular, wide,
humanlike broad shoulders and muscular arms

02:46:09.723 --> 02:46:15.184
themselves folded forward. You can see the head--
this full snake head is curled in, eyes closed and

02:46:15.184 --> 02:46:21.486
almost like prayer or sleep. Strung across one
side of its back is a long scimitar that's

02:46:21.486 --> 02:46:28.223
sheathed. The other shoulder has a longbow thrown
over the shoulder, and there is a beautiful silver

02:46:28.223 --> 02:46:33.762
shield, almost like silver and marble, that's
resting on the ground next to its coil, and it's

02:46:33.762 --> 02:46:39.339
quietly looking down towards the pool of water.
There are a couple of other raised platforms in

02:46:39.339 --> 02:46:45.680
the chamber. Decorative or ceremonial, you're
uncertain, but it is quiet, and what little

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:50.445
movement that remains there is probably just the
very faint ripples of the last bit of physical

02:46:50.445 --> 02:46:56.088
activity this creature had made amongst the
surface of the two to three inches of water that

02:46:56.088 --> 02:46:57.930
fills the chamber.

02:46:57.930 --> 02:47:00.143
TRAVIS: The whole chamber is two to three inches?

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:07.095
MATT: From what Beau can see, yes. The well is
risen above it and the surface is still on the top

02:47:07.095 --> 02:47:08.476
of that well.

02:47:08.476 --> 02:47:16.428
MARISHA: I communicate all of that to everybody.
Caduceus, you were talking about some--

02:47:16.428 --> 02:47:20.140
LAURA: (whispered) Has it been more than ten
minutes since the fight?

02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:21.400
MATT: Since the fight? Oh yeah.

02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:22.887
LAURA: (whispered) Okay, just checking.

02:47:22.887 --> 02:47:25.236
MARISHA: (whispering) You were talking about some
poison resistance.

02:47:25.236 --> 02:47:27.316
TALIESIN: I can do one.

02:47:27.316 --> 02:47:28.460
MARISHA: One?

02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:31.972
TALIESIN: Who's going to take it?

02:47:31.972 --> 02:47:35.355
TRAVIS: Not me.

02:47:35.355 --> 02:47:36.984
SAM: Take what?

02:47:36.984 --> 02:47:39.036
TALIESIN: Poison resistance.

02:47:39.036 --> 02:47:44.081
MARISHA: All I have are these.

02:47:44.081 --> 02:47:48.629
TRAVIS: Yeah. Give it to Beau.

02:47:48.629 --> 02:47:55.854
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to cast Protection
from Poison on Beau.

02:47:55.854 --> 02:47:58.554
MARISHA: Thank you. I also communicate--

02:47:58.554 --> 02:48:01.310
MATT: What level is that?

02:48:01.310 --> 02:48:05.138
TALIESIN: Level two. You have advantage on saving
throws against being poisoned, and you have

02:48:05.138 --> 02:48:07.342
resistance to poison damage.

02:48:07.342 --> 02:48:20.022
MARISHA: Thank you. I also said: He has a shield
and a scimitar. I don't know if we can get the

02:48:20.022 --> 02:48:29.423
shield away from him, but it'll make him easier to
hit.

02:48:29.423 --> 02:48:35.023
LIAM: Is it pitch-black in there, or is there a
light source?

02:48:35.023 --> 02:48:36.492
MATT: There is no light source.

02:48:36.492 --> 02:48:39.665
TRAVIS: It looks like he's asleep or praying, you
said?

02:48:39.665 --> 02:48:44.953
MARISHA: It almost is like he's meditating, like I
did that <i>one</i> time.

02:48:44.953 --> 02:48:48.204
MATT: That one time.

02:48:48.204 --> 02:48:49.570
TRAVIS: What a good monk.

02:48:49.570 --> 02:48:56.277
MARISHA: Yeah. He's looking into the water, which
makes me nervous about the water, because what

02:48:56.277 --> 02:48:59.975
could come out of it?

02:48:59.975 --> 02:49:02.057
LAURA: (whispered) I feel like we should spring an
attack on him.

02:49:02.057 --> 02:49:02.988
TRAVIS: You don't have to whisper.

02:49:02.988 --> 02:49:05.314
LAURA: (normal voice) I feel like we should spring
an attack on him.

02:49:05.314 --> 02:49:07.020
TRAVIS: We'll probably get <i>one</i> shot.

02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:09.225
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Can we get the shield away
from him?

02:49:09.225 --> 02:49:11.593
TRAVIS: Who's got one awesome shot?

02:49:11.593 --> 02:49:13.034
SAM: We do.

02:49:13.034 --> 02:49:14.992
TRAVIS: We do?

02:49:14.992 --> 02:49:16.846
SAM and LAURA: We do.

02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:18.936
TRAVIS: What's your awesome shot?

02:49:18.936 --> 02:49:22.730
SAM: It's a little something we like to call--

02:49:22.730 --> 02:49:29.512
SAM and LAURA: Fluffernutter.

02:49:29.512 --> 02:49:36.014
TRAVIS: I want to say yes. I just don't know if
now's the time to be demoing a new thing.

02:49:36.014 --> 02:49:39.252
MARISHA: Can you pitch it to us in 30 seconds or
less?

02:49:39.252 --> 02:49:41.423
LIAM: A quick pitch would be really good.

02:49:41.423 --> 02:49:43.698
MARISHA: Do you have a one sheet?

02:49:43.698 --> 02:49:47.099
TRAVIS: You know what? Fluffernutter sounds
great.

02:49:47.099 --> 02:49:52.719
LIAM: No. I'm so high right now, but I know that
that is not a good-- what is it?

02:49:52.719 --> 02:49:56.185
SAM: (crossbow locking)

02:49:56.185 --> 02:49:58.357
TRAVIS: What are you holding?

02:49:58.357 --> 02:49:59.511
LIAM: What is that?

02:49:59.511 --> 02:50:04.317
LAURA: I'm pulling out the little keg of black
powder that Nott stole from the pirate ship.

02:50:04.317 --> 02:50:08.910
SAM: I've got my explosive arrow nocked.

02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:10.909
MARISHA: Starting to get a picture, yeah.

02:50:10.909 --> 02:50:14.991
TRAVIS: Couple quick thoughts. When we tried to
blow up the tree, didn't work so well. Two

02:50:14.991 --> 02:50:20.431
load-bearing beams in a closed room with no
windows, so it's going to hurt us too.

02:50:20.431 --> 02:50:22.046
LAURA: Fluffernutter.

02:50:22.046 --> 02:50:29.071
TRAVIS: Okay, the name is great. I'm just thinking
maybe in practical use, not the best idea here.

02:50:29.071 --> 02:50:30.346
SAM: Think about this.

02:50:30.346 --> 02:50:32.854
TRAVIS: I am the only one doing that.

02:50:32.854 --> 02:50:44.902
SAM: She throws it, I fire, it explodes. No
structural damage, only damage to the creature.

02:50:44.902 --> 02:50:47.541
That's how I see it going down.

02:50:47.541 --> 02:50:54.456
(laughter)

02:50:54.456 --> 02:50:57.433
LAURA: We're whispering all of this very quietly.

02:50:57.433 --> 02:51:04.770
MARISHA: If you miss though, the ground is covered
in water, so the powder will get really wet.

02:51:04.770 --> 02:51:07.534
TRAVIS: Hold for just a second. Captain.

02:51:07.534 --> 02:51:09.158
MATT: "Yes?"

02:51:09.158 --> 02:51:17.196
TRAVIS: I have been an admirer of your ability to
disappear. We could use that talent now if you

02:51:17.196 --> 02:51:22.661
thought you could get up close and strike without
being detected. None of us--

02:51:22.661 --> 02:51:25.088
LAURA: We could Fireball it.

02:51:25.088 --> 02:51:34.925
LIAM: I cannot do that right now. One, I have not
prepared it. Two, I'm really messed up.

02:51:34.925 --> 02:51:41.128
TRAVIS: Do you think you have the skill to pull
off such a feat?

02:51:41.128 --> 02:51:46.586
MATT: "Why, but of course I can make myself or
another invisible."

02:51:46.586 --> 02:51:48.701
LAURA: (whispered) Another person could be
invisible.

02:51:48.701 --> 02:51:50.311
SAM: Like you, with the keg.

02:51:50.311 --> 02:52:02.055
LAURA: (whispered) I could have the keg. Yeah, or
I could be invisible, go in, and touch him and

02:52:02.055 --> 02:52:05.688
cast Inflict Wounds.

02:52:05.688 --> 02:52:07.573
SAM: What's that?

02:52:07.573 --> 02:52:08.711
TRAVIS: Is that pretty heavy duty?

02:52:08.711 --> 02:52:10.568
LAURA: It does a lot of damage if it hits.

02:52:10.568 --> 02:52:12.274
SAM: But it won't kill the thing.

02:52:12.274 --> 02:52:14.274
TRAVIS: Do you want to be danger close like that?

02:52:14.274 --> 02:52:17.752
LAURA: It's 5d10, and it's heavy!

02:52:17.752 --> 02:52:18.771
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:52:18.771 --> 02:52:19.940
SAM: That's not enough!

02:52:19.940 --> 02:52:23.369
MARISHA: She can potentially get a good--

02:52:23.369 --> 02:52:24.547
SAM: (crossbow locking)

02:52:24.547 --> 02:52:25.341
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Okay.

02:52:25.341 --> 02:52:28.034
SAM: I've cocked this thing three times!

02:52:28.075 --> 02:52:34.977
TRAVIS: Bolts are just popping off the end of it
and onto the floor, just expending shells onto the floor.

02:52:36.675 --> 02:52:40.501
LIAM: I could also summon Schmidt.

02:52:40.501 --> 02:52:42.856
TRAVIS: What is Schmidt?

02:52:42.856 --> 02:52:44.986
SAM: He's the invisible friend.

02:52:44.986 --> 02:52:47.754
LIAM: To carry the keg over--

02:52:47.754 --> 02:52:54.979
TRAVIS: No, no keg. This is fantasy and magic.
Fuck the blackpowder keg.

02:52:54.979 --> 02:52:58.491
SAM: Fjord. Counterargument: (crossbow locking)

02:52:58.491 --> 02:53:05.255
(laughter)

02:53:05.255 --> 02:53:09.349
TRAVIS: I have a strong feeling the keg of
blackpowder won't do that much damage.

02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:12.249
SAM: It will deafen the creature.

02:53:12.249 --> 02:53:14.357
TRAVIS: Nope. Don't even know if it has ears.

02:53:14.357 --> 02:53:17.255
SAM: It might bring some rocks down from the
ceiling.

02:53:17.255 --> 02:53:18.564
TRAVIS: And kill us all.

02:53:18.564 --> 02:53:22.240
SAM: No! It'll make a big puff of smoke. No one
will be able to see.

02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:27.480
TRAVIS: Molly-- Caduceus, fuck, balls! I'm sorry,
it happens all the time.

02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:28.806
TALIESIN: That hurts.

02:53:28.806 --> 02:53:30.629
SAM: Yasha's crying now.

02:53:30.629 --> 02:53:34.598
(laughter)

02:53:34.598 --> 02:53:43.219
TALIESIN: I apologize for this. I don't think it
needs to see. I'm not even sure if it really-- do

02:53:43.219 --> 02:53:46.327
I know how snakes--

02:53:46.327 --> 02:53:53.486
MATT: You get the sense from the fact that most of
this temple is not lit at all, has no light

02:53:53.486 --> 02:53:55.884
source, they probably can see in the dark.

02:53:55.884 --> 02:53:57.173
TALIESIN: It probably can see in the dark.

02:53:57.173 --> 02:53:58.648
MATT: They have eyes, not necessarily to see.

02:53:58.648 --> 02:54:00.105
SAM: Not in smoke!

02:54:00.105 --> 02:54:01.476
MARISHA: That's not how darkness works!

02:54:01.476 --> 02:54:06.341
SAM: Yeah! We make a bunch of smoke, the thing is
like, "I don't know what's going on!"

02:54:06.341 --> 02:54:09.603
MATT: Smoke still obscures in darkness.

02:54:09.603 --> 02:54:16.860
TALIESIN: I think that we need to stay far away
from this thing. I think we need to get its shield

02:54:16.860 --> 02:54:18.081
away from it.

02:54:18.081 --> 02:54:24.658
TRAVIS: If we're keeping our distance-- how many
people are seriously considering fluffernutter?

02:54:24.658 --> 02:54:34.379
Show of hands. Can we put that to bed now?

02:54:34.379 --> 02:54:40.507
SAM: I think that's about 15 to 16 votes if my
eyes don't deceive me.

02:54:40.507 --> 02:54:42.981
TRAVIS: (British accent) Governor?

02:54:42.981 --> 02:54:47.977
(laughter)

02:54:47.977 --> 02:54:58.099
SAM: I've never been thinking clearer than right
now! I see this working big time.

02:54:58.099 --> 02:55:02.733
LAURA: I could Invoke Duplicity in there and then
Inflict Wounds with my duplicate.

02:55:02.733 --> 02:55:05.870
SAM: Or carry the keg in with your duplicate and
do both!

02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:07.393
LAURA: She can't carry anything.

02:55:07.393 --> 02:55:08.366
TRAVIS: Caleb.

02:55:08.366 --> 02:55:09.350
LIAM: (growling)

02:55:09.350 --> 02:55:12.505
TRAVIS: What is the nastiest thing you have?

02:55:12.505 --> 02:55:21.672
LIAM: I did not bring anything nasty like that. I
came to be a team player today, like I always am. Captain?

02:55:21.827 --> 02:55:24.520
MATT: "Yes?"

02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:26.615
LIAM: Do you have any--

02:55:26.615 --> 02:55:28.148
MATT: "Is it Philip, yes?"

02:55:28.148 --> 02:55:32.515
LIAM: Philip. Do you have any ranged abilities as
a sneaky one?

02:55:32.515 --> 02:55:38.808
MATT: "I can throw this," and she tosses the
dagger and catches it. "But I am more of a up

02:55:38.850 --> 02:55:40.814
"close and personal eviscerator."

02:55:40.814 --> 02:55:41.764
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:55:41.764 --> 02:55:44.943
LAURA: I'll duplicate in and Inflict Wounds.

02:55:44.943 --> 02:55:46.731
TRAVIS: Can she make your duplicate invisible?

02:55:46.731 --> 02:55:50.041
LAURA: I can make my duplicate silent.

02:55:50.041 --> 02:55:54.560
LIAM: Anything that walks through there has to
float above the water, or it's going to disturb it

02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:55.630
and alert--

02:55:55.630 --> 02:56:03.093
LAURA: Yeah, it's a duplicate. It's not going to
touch anything, really. It's a hologram, it's an illusion.

02:56:03.093 --> 02:56:05.742
TRAVIS: Okay, actually, I like that the best.

02:56:05.742 --> 02:56:10.708
MARISHA: I'm into that, and someone should look at
the dodecahedron.

02:56:10.708 --> 02:56:12.694
LAURA: We already did it today.

02:56:12.694 --> 02:56:14.493
MARISHA: Oh, you got it? Okay.

02:56:14.493 --> 02:56:21.594
TRAVIS: Okay. We're going to send your duplicate
to Inflict Wounds, float it up the water, don't

02:56:21.594 --> 02:56:23.713
disturb anything.

02:56:23.713 --> 02:56:24.938
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:24.938 --> 02:56:26.118
SAM: But Plan B!

02:56:26.118 --> 02:56:27.447
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Fluffernutter.

02:56:27.447 --> 02:56:28.669
MARISHA: Sure, yeah.

02:56:28.669 --> 02:56:38.331
TRAVIS: Nott, if any of us are in the room, <i>no</i>
Fluffernutter, okay?

02:56:38.331 --> 02:56:40.218
SAM: (crossbow locking)

02:56:40.218 --> 02:56:41.642
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:56:41.642 --> 02:56:45.331
SAM: (tension releasing)

02:56:45.331 --> 02:56:50.338
TRAVIS: I feel like I'm talking to Baby Groot in
Guardians 2. If we're in the room--

02:56:50.338 --> 02:56:53.713
MARISHA: No button? Button!

02:56:53.713 --> 02:56:55.195
TRAVIS: Fluffernutter?

02:56:55.195 --> 02:56:56.647
SAM: Fluffernutter?

02:56:56.647 --> 02:56:59.838
TRAVIS: No. <i>No</i> fluffernutter.

02:56:59.838 --> 02:57:07.350
LIAM: Are you more coherent than me so that you
two can attack as one? Because I have seen you do

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:12.502
a lot of damage when the enemy does not know you
are coming. Could you go simultaneously?

02:57:12.502 --> 02:57:13.985
LAURA: At the same time?

02:57:13.985 --> 02:57:17.585
LIAM: Yeah, you watch her, and when her dupe goes,
you go, and then--

02:57:17.585 --> 02:57:21.479
LAURA: Yeah, so that he doesn't see it coming.

02:57:21.479 --> 02:57:24.097
LIAM: Oh, there's so many of you right now.

02:57:24.097 --> 02:57:26.449
SAM: I can shoot at something.

02:57:26.449 --> 02:57:28.198
TRAVIS: Whatever you're doing, let's do it.

02:57:28.198 --> 02:57:29.864
LAURA: Let's do it. Okay.

02:57:29.864 --> 02:57:31.809
LIAM: Both of you, same time.

02:57:31.809 --> 02:57:35.881
SAM: Can we peek in without it seeing us?

02:57:35.881 --> 02:57:37.720
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:42.327
TRAVIS: Jester and Nott, darkvision, silent as
shit.

02:57:42.327 --> 02:57:46.336
SAM: I'm going to take off my explosive bolt and
put on a reg.

02:57:46.336 --> 02:57:53.078
MATT: Okay. Given the circumstance, I would put
Jester and Nott nearest to the top here.

02:57:53.078 --> 02:57:55.817
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:57:55.817 --> 02:57:59.554
MATT: Right. Behind Jester and Nott would be
whom?

02:57:59.554 --> 02:58:00.795
LIAM: Caleb.

02:58:00.795 --> 02:58:03.487
MARISHA: I guess me.

02:58:03.487 --> 02:58:08.450
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of--

02:58:08.450 --> 02:58:13.716
TRAVIS: I'll be close to the front, too. I'll get
nasty, I have darkvision. I mean, the second that

02:58:13.716 --> 02:58:16.850
water gets disturbed, it's going to be boy howdy.

02:58:16.850 --> 02:58:18.884
MATT: Who's at the back of that? Sorry.

02:58:18.884 --> 02:58:21.449
MARISHA: Me and Fjord.

02:58:21.449 --> 02:58:27.959
MATT: All righty. Who's after them?

02:58:27.959 --> 02:58:29.609
TRAVIS: Wizard in the back.

02:58:29.609 --> 02:58:31.671
MATT: We'll say Avantika will be about there.

02:58:31.671 --> 02:58:33.073
TALIESIN: Wizard and cleric in the back.

02:58:33.073 --> 02:58:34.931
LIAM: Yeah.

02:58:34.931 --> 02:58:38.311
TRAVIS: Yasha can get behind Beau.

02:58:38.311 --> 02:58:40.436
MATT: Jamedi's staying back here with the group.

02:58:40.436 --> 02:58:42.726
LIAM: (singing) My anaconda don't. My anaconda
don't.

02:58:42.726 --> 02:58:45.601
MATT: That is the marching order as you guys are
in the staircase.

02:58:45.601 --> 02:58:50.075
LAURA: Would I know if when I cast my duplicate,
does it make a sound?

02:58:50.075 --> 02:58:52.705
MATT: It does not make a sound. It is illusory.

02:58:52.705 --> 02:58:56.676
LAURA: It's not a loser! It's really cool.

02:58:56.676 --> 02:58:58.485
LIAM: Wow.

02:58:58.485 --> 02:59:00.723
TRAVIS: Let's not before we fight.

02:59:00.723 --> 02:59:02.376
MATT: We're both right.

02:59:02.376 --> 02:59:08.316
(laughter)

02:59:08.316 --> 02:59:13.974
MATT: What's the plan? Who's going first?

02:59:13.974 --> 02:59:17.794
TALIESIN: Simultaneous.

02:59:17.794 --> 02:59:24.643
SAM: You're going to float your dupe across the
water, and as soon as you say go, your dupe casts?

02:59:24.752 --> 02:59:26.022
LAURA: Or go around it, it doesn't have to go
across the water.

02:59:26.022 --> 02:59:29.680
SAM: Sure, but your dupe floats. We're assuming
that the snake creature's asleep?

02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.215
TRAVIS: Or meditating.

02:59:31.215 --> 02:59:33.361
LAURA: Does it look like it's got its eyes
closed?

02:59:33.361 --> 02:59:36.428
MATT: Make a perception check, Jester.

02:59:38.428 --> 02:59:39.503
LAURA: 19.

02:59:39.503 --> 02:59:42.818
MATT: From here, best you can tell, its eyes are
closed.

02:59:44.497 --> 02:59:46.035
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:46.035 --> 02:59:54.361
SAM: Just float your dupe in, and when you say go,
I'll shoot. I'm more than 30 feet away, so I think

02:59:54.361 --> 02:59:55.997
I shoot at disadvantage.

02:59:55.997 --> 02:59:57.962
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

02:59:57.962 --> 03:00:01.868
MATT: All right, Invoke Duplicity. 30 feet away?
That's where it appears.

03:00:01.868 --> 03:00:09.776
LAURA: Okay. She can move up to 120 feet, so she's
going to float silently and be on-- yeah, behind

03:00:10.098 --> 03:00:11.377
it so it doesn't see it.

03:00:11.377 --> 03:00:13.188
MATT: Right. Like right there?

03:00:13.188 --> 03:00:13.800
LAURA: Yes.

03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:15.527
MATT: Adjacent, okay.

03:00:15.527 --> 03:00:24.040
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to cue Nott and at the
same time I'm going to Inflict Wounds. 3rd-level.

03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:28.769
You can shoot them at the same time. One, two,
three, go!

03:00:28.769 --> 03:00:31.313
MATT: All right, both attack with advantage.

03:00:31.313 --> 03:00:32.792
LAURA: At advantage?

03:00:32.792 --> 03:00:35.626
MATT: Melee spell attacks. It's an ambush. It
doesn't know you're there.

03:00:35.626 --> 03:00:36.564
MARISHA: Come on!

03:00:36.564 --> 03:00:38.816
SAM: Wait-- oh, she attacks with advantage.

03:00:38.816 --> 03:00:39.833
MATT: Correct.

03:00:39.833 --> 03:00:41.214
LAURA: Okay, wait, got to look at my spell.

03:00:41.214 --> 03:00:44.302
TRAVIS: Come on, 5d10.

03:00:44.302 --> 03:00:47.009
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

03:00:47.009 --> 03:00:47.683
TALIESIN: Hey!

03:00:47.683 --> 03:00:50.576
LAURA: Okay, that's good.16 plus seven is--

03:00:50.576 --> 03:00:51.544
TRAVIS: 24?

03:00:51.544 --> 03:00:53.190
LAURA: 16 plus seven is 23?

03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:54.060
TRAVIS: 23, right.

03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:55.806
MATT: That hits. And you?

03:00:55.806 --> 03:00:59.342
SAM: I'm think I shoot at disadvantage because I'm
longer than 30 feet away.

03:00:59.342 --> 03:01:00.205
MATT: You are, yes.

03:01:00.205 --> 03:01:01.116
SAM: So that's a ten.

03:01:01.116 --> 03:01:02.801
MATT: Ten misses.

03:01:02.801 --> 03:01:05.959
SAM: Can I bonus action? No, this is a single
sneak attack action.

03:01:05.959 --> 03:01:07.061
MATT: Correct.

03:01:07.061 --> 03:01:11.531
SAM: Cool. (arrow whizzing)

03:01:11.531 --> 03:01:14.596
LIAM: Does the dupe count as an ally, though?

03:01:14.596 --> 03:01:17.697
MATT: No, it does not. It has to occupy space for
it to be an ally.

03:01:17.697 --> 03:01:20.376
SAM: Do I get advantage on the attack if I'm
hidden?

03:01:20.376 --> 03:01:22.172
MATT: Right! So it should just be a single
attack.

03:01:22.172 --> 03:01:23.318
TRAVIS: I like that sound!

03:01:23.318 --> 03:01:25.705
MARISHA: I like it! I know, yeah, I'm into it!

03:01:25.705 --> 03:01:27.000
MATT: The first one you rolled?

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:30.962
SAM: The first one I rolled was a 12 plus eight is
20.

03:01:30.962 --> 03:01:32.604
MATT: That would hit, so roll damage.

03:01:32.604 --> 03:01:33.601
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:01:33.601 --> 03:01:34.776
LAURA: 38.

03:01:34.776 --> 03:01:36.733
LIAM: Unload it.

03:01:36.733 --> 03:01:39.209
MATT: Because it is an ambush you get advantage on
that.

03:01:39.209 --> 03:01:40.095
LAURA: 38.

03:01:40.095 --> 03:01:41.295
TALIESIN: 38. Is that just straight?

03:01:41.295 --> 03:01:43.320
LAURA: Times two. 38 times two.

03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:45.271
MATT: Oh, it was a critical hit?

03:01:45.271 --> 03:01:47.472
LAURA: Well, isn't it because it's a sneak attack?

03:01:47.472 --> 03:01:48.172
TALIESIN: No.

03:01:48.172 --> 03:01:49.205
MATT: No, no.

03:01:49.205 --> 03:01:50.738
LAURA: Oh, I'm thinking-- sorry.

03:01:50.738 --> 03:01:52.380
MATT: It's okay. You're thinking of a critical
hit.

03:01:52.380 --> 03:01:54.548
LAURA: Critical hit. You're right, sorry.

03:01:54.548 --> 03:01:56.581
MATT: It's all good. No worries. So the total is?

03:01:56.581 --> 03:01:57.793
LAURA: 38 points.

03:01:57.793 --> 03:02:00.325
MATT: 38 points of damage. That is not bad at
all.

03:02:00.325 --> 03:02:02.709
MARISHA: That's. Fucking. Awesome.

03:02:02.709 --> 03:02:04.103
MATT: All righty. Then--

03:02:04.103 --> 03:02:16.290
SAM: I rolled-- let's see here, sorry. I rolled a
15 and I will use-- because we short rested?

03:02:16.290 --> 03:02:17.469
TRAVIS: We did.

03:02:17.469 --> 03:02:20.646
SAM: I'll also use Fury of the Small again. So
that's 21.

03:02:20.646 --> 03:02:31.047
MATT: 21 points of damage in one round. (impacts)
The bolt hits. Immediately, the creature (growls).

03:02:31.047 --> 03:02:35.499
The eyes flash open and looks around, sees the
illusion, looks in the direction where the bolt

03:02:35.499 --> 03:02:40.053
came from and glances up and sees you at the top
of the stairway. Everyone roll initiative.

03:02:40.053 --> 03:02:43.371
(cheering)

03:02:43.371 --> 03:02:47.919
SAM: Fluffernutter would have totally obliterated
it. We wouldn't have even had to fight.

03:02:47.919 --> 03:02:51.268
TRAVIS: Please. You would have singed its scales.

03:02:51.268 --> 03:02:52.028
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:02:52.028 --> 03:02:53.326
LAURA: Yeah, right.

03:02:53.326 --> 03:02:55.366
MATT: All right, 25 to 20.

03:02:55.366 --> 03:03:00.146
MARISHA: Hang on. Okay-- nope.

03:03:00.146 --> 03:03:02.620
MATT: Nobody? 20 to 15?

03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:03.699
MARISHA: 19.

03:03:03.699 --> 03:03:04.569
SAM: 18.

03:03:04.569 --> 03:03:05.488
TRAVIS: 15.

03:03:05.488 --> 03:03:07.374
TALIESIN: Yasha got to roll, too?

03:03:07.374 --> 03:03:08.218
LIAM: 14.

03:03:08.218 --> 03:03:10.554
TRAVIS: Beau, Nott, Fjord--

03:03:10.554 --> 03:03:14.548
MATT: On what? What did you get? It was Nott--

03:03:14.548 --> 03:03:15.715
TRAVIS: Beau, Nott, Fjord.

03:03:15.715 --> 03:03:16.503
MATT: Fjord got what?

03:03:16.503 --> 03:03:17.203
TRAVIS: 15.

03:03:17.203 --> 03:03:19.484
MATT: All righty.

03:03:19.484 --> 03:03:20.999
LIAM: 14.

03:03:20.999 --> 03:03:27.991
MATT: Then Caleb got a 14. Now it is--

03:03:27.991 --> 03:03:29.828
TRAVIS: Ten to five?

03:03:29.828 --> 03:03:31.342
MATT: Ten to five.

03:03:31.342 --> 03:03:33.198
LAURA and TALIESIN: Eight.

03:03:33.198 --> 03:03:35.633
MATT: Aww. What did Yasha get?

03:03:35.633 --> 03:03:37.703
TRAVIS: Oh, she got an eight also, sorry.

03:03:37.703 --> 03:03:38.354
LAURA: Oh!

03:03:38.354 --> 03:03:41.145
LAURA: I feel like we won a slot machine.

03:03:41.145 --> 03:03:44.799
TALIESIN: Although that will be good because if I
go right before Yasha. That means that I can--

03:03:44.799 --> 03:03:48.237
MATT: That means that if you guys have any
creative ways to do combined attacks, the three of

03:03:48.237 --> 03:03:50.690
you can go at the same time and be fun with it.

03:03:50.690 --> 03:03:57.849
TALIESIN: Oh, that power of mine doesn't work as a
big, simultaneous smush, it's just one attack, but

03:03:57.849 --> 03:03:59.951
I have to choose which attack that it--

03:03:59.951 --> 03:04:03.201
MATT: Correct. Well, essentially in that order you
would be able to be like (spell attack) right

03:04:03.201 --> 03:04:05.354
before somebody hit if you wanted to. Because
you're still on the same initiative order.

03:04:05.354 --> 03:04:06.774
TALIESIN: Yeah. I still keep my reaction.

03:04:06.774 --> 03:04:12.067
MATT: Yeah. That brings us to the top of the
combat round. Beau, you're up first.

03:04:12.067 --> 03:04:24.949
MARISHA: (distressed humming) Fuck. Can I make it
to the thing? Can I make it to him?

03:04:24.949 --> 03:04:26.549
SAM: You're going to run all the way to the snake?

03:04:26.549 --> 03:04:29.322
MARISHA: I'm a <i>monk</i>. I've got fists!

03:04:29.322 --> 03:04:32.167
SAM: (dramatic yelling) I'm a monk!

03:04:32.167 --> 03:04:36.490
MARISHA: That's all I've got. How far can I make
it?

03:04:36.490 --> 03:04:39.023
MATT: Well, you have 45 feet as your distance,
right?

03:04:39.023 --> 03:04:40.937
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:04:40.937 --> 03:04:46.900
MATT: (counting) That's one move. That'll get you
about there.

03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:54.111
MARISHA: Can I come here? Kind of behind?

03:04:54.111 --> 03:04:55.457
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

03:04:55.457 --> 03:04:56.406
MARISHA: And-- oops!

03:04:56.406 --> 03:04:57.465
TALIESIN: Oh no!

03:04:57.465 --> 03:05:01.334
MARISHA: And throw a couple of shurikens?

03:05:01.334 --> 03:05:05.073
MATT: Try it out. It is 30 feet from you.

03:05:05.073 --> 03:05:07.249
MARISHA: That's exactly my range.

03:05:07.249 --> 03:05:08.770
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

03:05:08.770 --> 03:05:15.000
MARISHA: This is just plus my dex, right? Do I get
my attack bonus?

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:16.617
MATT: Yeah. It's a ranged--

03:05:16.617 --> 03:05:20.338
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. 18 for the first one.

03:05:20.338 --> 03:05:21.571
MATT: 18 hits.

03:05:21.571 --> 03:05:27.678
MARISHA: Ooh, that's better. That's a natural 13.

03:05:27.678 --> 03:05:29.100
MATT: All right. Roll damage for each.

03:05:29.100 --> 03:05:31.840
MARISHA: Okay. They're d4's, right?

03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:33.406
MATT: D4's, yep.

03:05:33.406 --> 03:05:42.548
MARISHA: Two d4's? The long debate of what's a
monk weapon-- so five plus (counting)--

03:05:42.548 --> 03:05:45.889
MATT: Well, hold on. If it's a monk weapon because
it's the shuriken you got--

03:05:45.889 --> 03:05:47.001
MARISHA: It's the darts.

03:05:47.001 --> 03:05:48.458
MATT: Oh, but the darts. They're not monk weapons,
yeah.

03:05:48.458 --> 03:05:50.003
MARISHA: We've gone back and forth about this.

03:05:50.003 --> 03:05:52.332
MATT: Yeah. The daggers or something akin to that
would be a monk weapon.

03:05:52.332 --> 03:05:59.764
MARISHA: The debate rages on. Sorry. Five plus
four which is nine plus another four which is 13?

03:05:59.764 --> 03:06:01.671
MATT: 13 damage total?

03:06:01.671 --> 03:06:05.308
MARISHA: Right? Yeah, 13 damage total. Then I'm
going to--

03:06:05.308 --> 03:06:08.311
LAURA: Stop. (giggles).

03:06:08.311 --> 03:06:10.745
MARISHA: Do I want to do Patient Defense?

03:06:10.745 --> 03:06:13.784
MATT: You can move five more feet there to get
behind that pole if you want.

03:06:13.784 --> 03:06:16.096
MARISHA: I'll do that.

03:06:16.096 --> 03:06:17.035
MATT: Okay.

03:06:17.035 --> 03:06:19.595
MARISHA: And hold-- I still have a bonus action
though, right?

03:06:19.595 --> 03:06:21.749
MATT: Patient Defense would be your bonus action.

03:06:21.749 --> 03:06:23.485
MARISHA: Nah, you know, I'm not going to do that.

03:06:23.485 --> 03:06:24.750
MATT: You're not going to do that? Then you still
have a bonus action.

03:06:24.750 --> 03:06:25.975
MARISHA: I'll throw one more.

03:06:25.975 --> 03:06:27.129
MATT: Sure.

03:06:27.129 --> 03:06:28.732
MARISHA: Right? I can do that?

03:06:28.732 --> 03:06:31.792
MATT: I think it's an unarmed attack, actually.
For your bonus action.

03:06:31.792 --> 03:06:34.339
MARISHA: Then I'll--

03:06:34.339 --> 03:06:36.079
MATT: I'll double check.

03:06:36.079 --> 03:06:37.850
MARISHA: No, that's probably right.

03:06:37.850 --> 03:06:42.667
MATT: The Player's Handbook has vanished from me.

03:06:42.667 --> 03:06:45.760
MARISHA: What? It should be right there.

03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:47.432
SAM: Under the paper.

03:06:47.432 --> 03:06:50.430
MARISHA: No, that's the Monster Manual, DM's
guide.

03:06:50.430 --> 03:06:51.480
LIAM: In your hand.

03:06:51.480 --> 03:06:53.862
MATT: It's all good. While I'm looking this up,
anything else--

03:06:53.862 --> 03:06:55.158
MARISHA: It's fine.

03:06:55.158 --> 03:06:59.275
MATT: An unarmed strike is a bonus action, so you
cannot throw a third shuriken.

03:06:59.275 --> 03:07:02.120
MARISHA: I'll just hold for now. I'll just hold.

03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:07.311
MATT: Hold. All right. That's Beau's turn. Next up
is Nott. Nott, you are up next.

03:07:07.311 --> 03:07:10.007
SAM: Ah! I'll go in to the left.

03:07:10.007 --> 03:07:11.676
MATT: Fjord, you're on deck.

03:07:11.676 --> 03:07:14.714
SAM: Into the left as far as I can.

03:07:14.714 --> 03:07:15.394
MATT: This way?

03:07:15.394 --> 03:07:16.010
SAM: Yep.

03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:20.451
MATT: All right. Five, ten, (counting).

03:07:20.451 --> 03:07:24.199
SAM: I think I was just at 30. On the way, I'll
fire another crossbow bolt.

03:07:24.199 --> 03:07:25.188
MATT: Go for it.

03:07:25.188 --> 03:07:26.752
SAM: Ooh. Not good. 16.

03:07:26.752 --> 03:07:27.537
MATT: 16 hits.

03:07:27.537 --> 03:07:29.143
SAM and LAURA: Ey!

03:07:29.143 --> 03:07:33.887
SAM: Is it engaged with Jester's dupe?

03:07:33.887 --> 03:07:37.243
MATT: It does not count as an adjacent ally,
unfortunately.

03:07:37.243 --> 03:07:39.500
SAM: Boo. I rolled a six, though, so that's 11
points of damage.

03:07:39.500 --> 03:07:46.390
MATT: 11 points of damage. Nice! As the three
shurikens stick into its form (growling and hissing)

03:07:46.890 --> 03:07:47.842
SAM: Ah! Jesus.

03:07:47.842 --> 03:07:51.048
MATT: It sees you rush past and (growling).

03:07:51.048 --> 03:07:58.161
SAM: As it strikes and maybe looks down to see
where I got it, I'll bonus action hide behind the

03:07:58.161 --> 03:08:03.951
pillar. Okay. Ooh! 29 to hide.

03:08:03.951 --> 03:08:08.231
MATT: Okay. It looks (growling), it looks up
(snorting) and can't quite track you. It does see

03:08:08.231 --> 03:08:09.941
Jester up in the stairway, though.

03:08:09.941 --> 03:08:11.042
LAURA: Oh no!

03:08:11.042 --> 03:08:19.469
MATT: It's now its turn as the abomination takes
its round. It is going to pull its scimitar out

03:08:19.469 --> 03:08:25.617
and rake it across the stone, carving sparks and
grinding off some of them causing this echo

03:08:25.617 --> 03:08:31.439
throughout the chamber before resheathing it and
pulling its longbow out and getting it out to fire

03:08:31.439 --> 03:08:33.973
a volley of two arrows at Jester.

03:08:33.973 --> 03:08:37.041
LAURA: At me? But I could've hidden or something.

03:08:37.041 --> 03:08:43.516
MATT: With the longbow, you are in its first
range. First attack is 18 to hit.

03:08:43.516 --> 03:08:45.489
LAURA: That's my armor class.

03:08:45.489 --> 03:08:53.951
MATT: Oh yeah, that does hit. You take 18 points
of piercing damage as well as--

03:08:53.951 --> 03:08:57.686
SAM: 18 points?! From a bow shot?

03:08:57.686 --> 03:08:59.948
MATT: As well as 15 points of poison damage.

03:08:59.948 --> 03:09:02.953
SAM: Ooh. Wait, are you resistant to poison?

03:09:02.953 --> 03:09:09.194
MATT: As the arrow (groaning), it's longer than an
average arrow. This longbow is a longbow for one

03:09:09.194 --> 03:09:17.016
of these large abominations and it just sinks into
you. It pulls back for another arrow.

03:09:17.016 --> 03:09:18.795
SAM: Oh no. A second shot?

03:09:18.795 --> 03:09:20.214
MATT: That is a 15.

03:09:20.214 --> 03:09:21.457
LAURA: Oh, good. It misses me.

03:09:21.457 --> 03:09:22.272
SAM: Oh my god.

03:09:22.272 --> 03:09:26.457
MATT: This one you deflect it and the arrow
splinters off and hits the wall. With that, it's

03:09:26.457 --> 03:09:36.302
going to move behind here and is now back to the
wall and it's getting another arrow ready. That

03:09:36.302 --> 03:09:37.851
brings the end of his turn. Fjord, you're up.

03:09:37.851 --> 03:09:41.492
TRAVIS: Yeah. I will use my 30 feet of speed to
run in the direction of Nott.

03:09:41.492 --> 03:09:46.052
SAM: Don't draw attention. Go away!

03:09:46.052 --> 03:09:53.440
TRAVIS: I will cast Hunger of Hadar.

03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:57.704
SAM: (in deep voice) Hunger of Hadar.

03:09:57.704 --> 03:10:09.393
TRAVIS: 20-foot sphere, 20-foot diameter with the
closest lip of it on the side of the well that's

03:10:09.393 --> 03:10:13.218
closest to us. Here, back.

03:10:13.218 --> 03:10:14.225
MATT: Here, back?

03:10:14.225 --> 03:10:14.959
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:10:14.959 --> 03:10:20.281
MATT: We'll say there, there, there.

03:10:20.281 --> 03:10:23.178
LAURA: Does that reach the creature?

03:10:23.178 --> 03:10:25.614
TRAVIS: I hope so if it won't, I'll move it.

03:10:25.614 --> 03:10:30.463
MATT: Well, you're glancing your eye, it's where
you looking at. Going to land wherever it lands,

03:10:30.463 --> 03:10:32.846
wherever you want to place it.

03:10:32.846 --> 03:10:35.008
TRAVIS: Thought there was a big circle.

03:10:35.008 --> 03:10:37.922
MATT: 20-foot radius? Yeah, that'll definitely be
good.

03:10:37.922 --> 03:10:44.916
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's good. Yeah, cover the well,
cover him. Get everybody in, hopefully.

03:10:44.916 --> 03:10:47.229
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

03:10:47.229 --> 03:10:55.870
MATT: Back there. Yeah, that's about right. The
whole area fills with darkness, and these strange,

03:10:55.870 --> 03:11:03.247
somewhat translucent, slimy tendrils occasionally
whip out the sides of this orb where light cannot

03:11:03.247 --> 03:11:07.857
pierce. That's your action and your movement, is
that the end of your turn?

03:11:07.857 --> 03:11:08.512
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:11:08.512 --> 03:11:11.763
MATT: All right. That brings us to Caleb. You're
up.

03:11:11.763 --> 03:11:18.128
LIAM: I'm going to push forward through the
passage and peek over Jester's shoulders. I can

03:11:18.128 --> 03:11:25.505
see this guy partially hidden behind-- it's too
early. I give a tug to the glove of blasting and I

03:11:25.505 --> 03:11:28.455
am sending out three Scorching Rays.

03:11:28.455 --> 03:11:31.218
LAURA: We won't see anything into it, though,
because it's just black.

03:11:31.218 --> 03:11:32.986
LIAM: Is it pitch black still? There's no--?

03:11:32.986 --> 03:11:34.294
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's black.

03:11:34.294 --> 03:11:37.903
MATT: You come around the chamber and you look and
all you see is a giant sphere of blackness. You

03:11:37.903 --> 03:11:39.130
have no idea where the creature is.

03:11:39.130 --> 03:11:42.830
LIAM: It's pitch black? I have darkvision because
of the transmutation stone.

03:11:42.830 --> 03:11:44.785
MATT: Let's double check.

03:11:44.785 --> 03:11:48.416
TRAVIS: "You open a gateway to the dark. 20-foot
radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold."

03:11:48.416 --> 03:11:50.803
LIAM: Oh, it's totally dark because of what you
just did.

03:11:50.803 --> 03:11:54.214
MATT: "No light, magical or otherwise, can
illuminate the area, and creatures fully within

03:11:54.214 --> 03:11:55.319
"the area are blinded."

03:11:55.319 --> 03:11:57.141
LIAM: I don't see it at all.

03:11:57.141 --> 03:12:02.813
TRAVIS: You could hold it in case something comes
out of the sphere or the well.

03:12:06.243 --> 03:12:21.439
LIAM: Shit, I don't like this. Balls. I'm going to
cast-- no, I don't know where it is at all.

03:12:21.439 --> 03:12:22.871
MATT: Yeah, you haven't seen it yet.

03:12:22.871 --> 03:12:32.016
LIAM: Yeah, so I can't even aim at disadvantage.
Okay. What I am going to do is peek around the

03:12:32.016 --> 03:12:38.271
corner, and cast Haste on Beauregard.

03:12:38.271 --> 03:12:44.000
SAM: Nice. Useful. Beauregard.

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:44.827
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:44.827 --> 03:12:46.096
LIAM: You're hasted.

03:12:46.096 --> 03:12:47.585
SAM: You are super fast!

03:12:47.585 --> 03:12:50.132
MARISHA: Oh shit, fast. Super fast. Okay.

03:12:50.132 --> 03:12:51.674
SAM: Super fly.

03:12:51.674 --> 03:12:55.790
MATT: You are concentrating on that. All righty.
That ends Caleb's turn.

03:12:55.790 --> 03:13:00.171
LIAM: I will step out back into the passage so I'm
not in view.

03:13:00.171 --> 03:13:04.421
MATT: All right. That brings us to Yasha,
Caduceus, and Jester.

03:13:04.421 --> 03:13:06.121
LAURA: Wow!

03:13:06.121 --> 03:13:12.937
TALIESIN: Wow. I'm going to give you a quick pop
since you could use a little bit of--

03:13:12.937 --> 03:13:14.804
LAURA: Oh! Thank you, Caduceus.

03:13:14.804 --> 03:13:21.115
TALIESIN: You're welcome, I can't keep doing that.
Just a quick Cure Wounds really quickly.

03:13:21.115 --> 03:13:25.731
MATT: All right. d8 plus five, I believe.

03:13:25.731 --> 03:13:34.336
TALIESIN: Where are my d8s? That's not a d8. Ah, a
d8. That's nine points of damage.

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:35.718
LAURA: Nine!

03:13:35.723 --> 03:13:40.233
(music)

03:13:40.233 --> 03:13:45.935
TALIESIN: Yeah, my bonus actions, not a lot I can
do with my bonus actions at the moment.

03:13:45.935 --> 03:13:49.710
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to use her bonus action to
rage.

03:13:49.710 --> 03:13:50.920
MATT: Of course.

03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:53.766
TRAVIS: Double dash into this corner past Beau.

03:13:53.766 --> 03:13:56.889
MATT: Remember, if she doesn't attack or be
attacked, she loses her rage next round.

03:13:57.305 --> 03:13:58.836
TRAVIS: I'll hold it, thank you for the reminder.
You're right.

03:13:58.836 --> 03:14:00.055
MATT: She's going double rush in?

03:14:00.055 --> 03:14:00.497
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:14:00.497 --> 03:14:03.869
MATT: (counting) 30, 35, 40.

03:14:03.869 --> 03:14:05.729
TRAVIS: Then double dash.

03:14:05.729 --> 03:14:07.823
MATT: Dash and she can get over on this side, you
mean?

03:14:07.823 --> 03:14:08.959
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:14:08.959 --> 03:14:13.096
TALIESIN: For my bonus action, I'm going to cast a
Light spell on the other side of the wall really

03:14:13.096 --> 03:14:14.736
quickly so that we have some light in this.

03:14:14.736 --> 03:14:15.552
MATT: Over here?

03:14:15.552 --> 03:14:17.141
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just on one of the columns.

03:14:17.141 --> 03:14:21.464
MATT: All right. Now the chamber, primarily, is
now visible to everybody without issue, yourself included.

03:14:22.086 --> 03:14:23.243
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to take some cover.

03:14:23.243 --> 03:14:25.922
MATT: Is it an action to cast Light as a cantrip?

03:14:25.922 --> 03:14:29.939
TALIESIN: Oh, it's an action, never mind, can't do
it!

03:14:29.939 --> 03:14:33.312
MATT: Well, you had cast Light previously on the
edge of your staff. You're still giving off your

03:14:33.312 --> 03:14:34.327
own light source.

03:14:34.327 --> 03:14:36.798
TALIESIN: Okay, well I'm going to hide.

03:14:36.798 --> 03:14:38.540
MATT: Are you going to stay put, then?

03:14:38.540 --> 03:14:40.741
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull in the back and hide.

03:14:40.741 --> 03:14:42.723
MATT: In the back of the hallway there?

03:14:42.723 --> 03:14:46.895
TALIESIN: Yeah, just around the corner so I can't
get hit by a bow. I'm going to advise you do the

03:14:46.895 --> 03:14:48.188
same eventually.

03:14:48.188 --> 03:14:53.082
LAURA: Yes. I was watching when he walked around
the pillar, so I saw where he went.

03:14:53.082 --> 03:14:54.176
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:14:54.176 --> 03:15:00.621
LAURA: I'm going to send my duplicate backwards a
few steps and hold out her hand and hope that she

03:15:00.621 --> 03:15:02.124
touches him.

03:15:02.124 --> 03:15:07.334
MATT: Okay. Back a few steps. Make an attack with
disadvantage, if you're going to be doing

03:15:07.334 --> 03:15:08.370
something else.

03:15:08.370 --> 03:15:09.072
LAURA: Yeah.

03:15:09.072 --> 03:15:10.509
MATT: Are you doing another Inflict Wounds?

03:15:10.509 --> 03:15:11.183
LAURA: Yeah.

03:15:11.183 --> 03:15:12.266
MATT: All right.

03:15:12.266 --> 03:15:14.460
LAURA: At 3rd-level.

03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:15.891
MATT: Okay.

03:15:15.891 --> 03:15:21.497
LAURA: Ah, fuck me. It doesn't hit. Nine.

03:15:21.497 --> 03:15:26.928
MATT: You go to release. Spell is expended, but no
impact on the creature, unfortunately. 3rd-level

03:15:26.928 --> 03:15:28.030
spell used.

03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:30.872
LAURA: Man, sucks. Okay. That's fine.

03:15:30.872 --> 03:15:32.475
LIAM: Your dice look really good tonight.

03:15:32.475 --> 03:15:33.730
LAURA: They're really pretty, right?

03:15:33.730 --> 03:15:35.680
LIAM: Yeah, totally.

03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:39.972
LAURA: Oh, and I'm going to move around the corner
so that he can't fucking shoot arrows at me.

03:15:39.972 --> 03:15:41.739
MATT: Back up here? All righty.

03:15:41.739 --> 03:15:43.057
LAURA: Yeah.

03:15:43.057 --> 03:15:45.923
MATT: Crowded hallway. All right.

03:15:45.923 --> 03:15:49.709
SAM: It's a bunch of people waiting in line for
the bathroom.

03:15:49.709 --> 03:15:52.263
LAURA: Shit.

03:15:52.263 --> 03:15:55.756
SAM: I really have to go. Can I go before you?
Thanks.

03:15:55.756 --> 03:16:02.366
(music)

03:16:02.366 --> 03:16:05.669
LIAM: Just waiting for the other shoe to drop,
here.

03:16:05.669 --> 03:16:08.418
TALIESIN: We've already done some damage. He's
about to take more damage.

03:16:08.418 --> 03:16:10.474
MATT: Start of the turn, got it.

03:16:10.474 --> 03:16:11.893
TRAVIS: 2d6?

03:16:11.893 --> 03:16:16.061
MATT: All right. At the top of his turn. However,
you guys both finish. Yasha did her turn. You're

03:16:16.061 --> 03:16:21.443
all done there, looks good. Now comes to Avantika
and Jamedi. Avantika's going to charge down.

03:16:23.403 --> 03:16:31.937
SAM: (French accent) Into the fray! Do those
tentacles attack good guys, too?

03:16:31.937 --> 03:16:39.095
MATT: Goes in there with blades out ready to go.
Jamedi is going to come forward and take the torch

03:16:39.095 --> 03:16:45.277
and throw it further inside. It clatters this way,
helps illuminate that side of the chamber, and

03:16:45.277 --> 03:16:47.036
then backs up.

03:16:47.036 --> 03:16:50.180
LIAM: Not knowing how Hadar's works, it doesn't
pierce that area, though, right?

03:16:50.180 --> 03:16:52.275
MATT: Correct. It lights everything around it.

03:16:52.275 --> 03:16:54.223
TALIESIN: There's a bubble.

03:16:54.223 --> 03:17:02.573
MATT: Top of the round. The surface of the well
begins to bubble and move. The water begins to

03:17:02.573 --> 03:17:08.157
rise up like the surface bubbles up and begins to
pour on the side. As you watch this large,

03:17:08.157 --> 03:17:18.507
snake-like serpent head arrives. And another. And
another. And another. You see emerging from the

03:17:18.507 --> 03:17:20.084
center of this chamber--

03:17:20.084 --> 03:17:22.279
MARISHA: A hydra!

03:17:22.279 --> 03:17:24.373
TRAVIS: My god, what the fuck is that?!

03:17:24.373 --> 03:17:25.511
LIAM: A hydra!

03:17:25.511 --> 03:17:31.305
MATT: -- the true guardian: the Warden. Spoken of
in the text above.

03:17:31.305 --> 03:17:35.706
MARISHA: Who's the False Serpent? If the Warden
guards the False Serpent?

03:17:35.706 --> 03:17:38.702
LAURA: We haven't gotten to the False Serpent yet,
this is the Warden!

03:17:38.702 --> 03:17:39.794
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:17:39.794 --> 03:17:41.197
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:17:41.197 --> 03:17:43.053
SAM: That's the biggest thing I've ever seen!

03:17:43.053 --> 03:17:46.951
MATT: It definitely enters the Hunger of Hadar.

03:17:46.951 --> 03:17:48.354
TRAVIS: 2d6.

03:17:48.354 --> 03:17:52.379
MATT: A dexterity saving throw on its point there.
That is a ten.

03:17:52.379 --> 03:17:55.241
LAURA: We couldn't even kill the stupid little
snake guy, how are we going to kill a hydra?!

03:17:55.241 --> 03:17:57.419
TRAVIS: Ten points of cold damage.

03:17:57.419 --> 03:17:59.413
MATT: Ten points of cold damage to the hydra.

03:17:59.413 --> 03:18:00.356
LAURA: So stupid.

03:18:00.356 --> 03:18:05.129
MARISHA: Okay.

03:18:05.129 --> 03:18:08.082
MATT: All right. Gotcha.

03:18:08.082 --> 03:18:10.297
SAM: Yeah, you did get us.

03:18:10.297 --> 03:18:11.824
TRAVIS: Speed is halved.

03:18:11.824 --> 03:18:15.669
LIAM: Because of the Hadar's?

03:18:15.669 --> 03:18:16.997
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:18:16.997 --> 03:18:21.969
MATT: Right now, Avantika's the one closest to
it.

03:18:21.969 --> 03:18:23.137
SAM: Oh no.

03:18:23.137 --> 03:18:25.001
MATT: Moves forward.

03:18:25.001 --> 03:18:27.610
SAM: Oh. No. Stop. Don't.

03:18:27.610 --> 03:18:33.699
MATT: Has a reach of ten. Doesn't have to fully
get into melee with her. It's going to take

03:18:33.699 --> 03:18:36.455
multiple attacks at her.

03:18:36.455 --> 03:18:41.234
LAURA: We didn't even see the heads come out, we
just see the heads pop out of this bubble of blackness.

03:18:41.559 --> 03:18:51.894
MATT: You see this body emerge from it. That is a
natural one. Good for her. That misses. 16. That

03:18:51.894 --> 03:19:04.726
hits. That hits, and that hits. With that,
Avantika takes 15 points of piercing damage. Ten

03:19:04.726 --> 03:19:09.234
points of piercing damage, and 11 points of
piercing damage.

03:19:09.234 --> 03:19:11.379
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:19:11.379 --> 03:19:19.178
MATT: Avantika, she's like, "Holy fucking shit! I
could use some assistance!"

03:19:19.178 --> 03:19:20.331
TRAVIS: <i>Merde!</i>

03:19:20.331 --> 03:19:24.387
MATT: She is just trying to fight these things
off. All right, now it's Beau's turn.

03:19:24.387 --> 03:19:26.613
TRAVIS: Does it end its turn in the sphere as
well?

03:19:26.613 --> 03:19:28.011
MATT: It does.

03:19:28.011 --> 03:19:29.267
TRAVIS: 2d6.

03:19:29.267 --> 03:19:32.385
SAM: Ooh! So many d's.

03:19:32.385 --> 03:19:36.263
TRAVIS: Nine points of acid damage, if that makes
any difference.

03:19:36.263 --> 03:19:40.025
SAM: Hydra is down to 500 hit points!

03:19:40.025 --> 03:19:48.325
MATT: Got it. It's burning and holding it in
place, slowing it down, but it seems to neglect it

03:19:48.325 --> 03:19:49.617
for the most part.

03:19:49.617 --> 03:19:51.658
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem so great now.

03:19:51.658 --> 03:19:55.425
MATT: All right. That brings us to--

03:19:55.425 --> 03:19:56.634
MARISHA: To Beau?

03:19:56.634 --> 03:19:57.669
MATT: -- Beau's turn.

03:19:57.669 --> 03:20:01.519
MARISHA: (yelling) I'm going to attack it!

03:20:01.519 --> 03:20:02.700
MATT: All right.

03:20:02.700 --> 03:20:04.309
MARISHA: With my fists!

03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:06.649
MATT: As Beau swings around, Hasted--

03:20:06.649 --> 03:20:07.930
LAURA: Can you flank it?

03:20:07.930 --> 03:20:09.200
MARISHA: Holy shit!

03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:10.857
MATT: Not at its current position.

03:20:10.857 --> 03:20:15.880
MARISHA: Actually, can I go around? Can I flank
with Avantika? Or no? No, you got to be in the water.

03:20:16.107 --> 03:20:17.647
MATT: You can get into the pool, if you want to.

03:20:17.647 --> 03:20:19.400
MARISHA: Why are you putting a thing on me?

03:20:19.400 --> 03:20:20.770
LIAM and MATT: You're Hasted.

03:20:20.770 --> 03:20:22.320
MARISHA: Oh, it's a good thing!

03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:23.859
MATT: Where do you want to be? Here? Here?

03:20:23.859 --> 03:20:25.009
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

03:20:25.009 --> 03:20:26.291
LIAM: Speed is doubled.

03:20:26.291 --> 03:20:28.026
MATT: All righty. Go for it.

03:20:28.026 --> 03:20:33.110
MARISHA: I'm going to come in and I'm going to do
a big spinning barrel flip with two flying kicks!

03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:39.842
Crack, crack! Right onto its spinal cord. Sorry,
Gil, you've been destroying me here lately. First

03:20:39.842 --> 03:20:50.708
two hits! Oh! Did you see that?! That was such
shit! 14 for one.

03:20:50.708 --> 03:20:55.425
MATT: 14 just misses. Your staff just scrapes off
of its hard armor.

03:20:55.425 --> 03:20:57.091
MARISHA: No, they both miss.

03:20:57.091 --> 03:20:58.942
LIAM: What about your extra attack?

03:20:58.942 --> 03:21:03.289
MARISHA: I'm going to do that. I'm going to do
more attack because of Haste!

03:21:03.289 --> 03:21:05.881
SAM: Get out of there!

03:21:05.881 --> 03:21:11.161
MARISHA: (groans)

03:21:11.161 --> 03:21:12.693
SAM: Get out of there!

03:21:12.693 --> 03:21:14.150
LIAM: Disengage and bolt.

03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:18.851
LAURA: Travis, your face was just like-- That's
the most amazing face you just made.

03:21:18.851 --> 03:21:20.151
MATT: You still have a bonus action.

03:21:20.151 --> 03:21:21.488
MARISHA: I'm not going to get out of there!

03:21:21.488 --> 03:21:22.407
SAM: Get out of there!

03:21:22.407 --> 03:21:23.406
MARISHA: I'm going to stay there!

03:21:23.406 --> 03:21:25.244
SAM: No! Get out of there!

03:21:25.244 --> 03:21:29.784
TRAVIS: Remember: Ten! 15! 11! Lots of points of
damage.

03:21:29.784 --> 03:21:32.887
MARISHA: You're right, I'm going to back up and be
like, this sucks!

03:21:32.887 --> 03:21:35.961
MATT: What are you going to do? Don't listen to
them, do what you were going to do.

03:21:35.961 --> 03:21:38.816
MARISHA: Can I disengage as a bonus with Haste?

03:21:38.816 --> 03:21:43.113
MATT: No. Disengage is an action, unless you're a
rogue and had that ability.

03:21:43.113 --> 03:21:44.655
MARISHA: If I leave, I'm going to get hit.

03:21:44.655 --> 03:21:45.930
MATT: Probably.

03:21:45.930 --> 03:21:54.313
MARISHA: I'm going to take a bonus action to
Patient Defense.

03:21:54.313 --> 03:21:55.459
MATT: Okay. That's good.

03:21:55.459 --> 03:21:58.737
MARISHA: I'm going to try and tank this.

03:21:58.737 --> 03:22:02.047
TRAVIS: Was it three attacks from the hydra on
Avantika or four?

03:22:02.047 --> 03:22:03.286
MARISHA: I could have left.

03:22:03.286 --> 03:22:05.462
LAURA: It landed three. It got five attacks.

03:22:05.462 --> 03:22:07.317
MATT: One per head.

03:22:07.317 --> 03:22:08.975
LAURA: Yeah.

03:22:08.975 --> 03:22:10.732
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:22:10.732 --> 03:22:12.302
MARISHA: Kill it!

03:22:12.302 --> 03:22:14.681
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn. Nott, you're up.

03:22:14.681 --> 03:22:17.050
MARISHA: Jesus! Oh no!

03:22:17.050 --> 03:22:19.746
LIAM: Is each head a creature, or is each head
a--? Never mind.

03:22:19.746 --> 03:22:21.363
MATT: It's a singular creature.

03:22:21.363 --> 03:22:28.721
MARISHA: Step of the Wind. I could have disengaged
as a bonus action, but I want to stay.

03:22:28.721 --> 03:22:30.220
SAM: Sure you can.

03:22:30.220 --> 03:22:33.791
MATT: Step of the Wind allows you to do that?

03:22:33.791 --> 03:22:38.661
MARISHA: It does, yeah, it does. But I'm going to
stay. I don't want to do that, I want to stay and tank.

03:22:38.960 --> 03:22:40.165
MATT: Nott, what are you doing?

03:22:40.165 --> 03:22:46.133
SAM: I guess I don't see eyes on the other thing,
so I will step out and fire at one of those heads.

03:22:46.133 --> 03:22:47.620
MATT: Go for it.

03:22:47.620 --> 03:22:53.700
SAM: Terrible. I don't have any sort of advantage,
right? 11 points.

03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:57.186
MATT: 11 to attack? Misses.

03:22:57.186 --> 03:23:02.252
TALIESIN: Isn't it technically a sneak attack at
this point?

03:23:02.252 --> 03:23:05.295
MATT: Yeah, she doesn't know you're there, so it
would be advantage since you were hidden previously.

03:23:05.829 --> 03:23:07.778
SAM: I was hidden. 20 to hit!

03:23:07.778 --> 03:23:08.942
MATT: That does hit.

03:23:08.942 --> 03:23:10.181
SAM: Okay!

03:23:10.181 --> 03:23:13.178
MATT: You do get sneak attack damage.

03:23:13.178 --> 03:23:15.343
SAM: (counting) 16.

03:23:15.343 --> 03:23:21.481
MATT: 16 points of damage to it. Strikes into it,
one of the heads looks back into your direction,

03:23:21.481 --> 03:23:22.538
glancing around.

03:23:22.538 --> 03:23:33.498
SAM: (fearful yelp) I will shout out, Fluffernutter!
I'm going to go back behind the pillar and hide.

03:23:33.498 --> 03:23:37.086
MATT: Back which way, to here?

03:23:37.086 --> 03:23:41.853
SAM: Yeah, and I'm hiding. 20.

03:23:41.853 --> 03:23:45.578
MATT: Got it. That finishes your turn, Nott. It's
now the abomination's turn.

03:23:45.578 --> 03:23:47.247
TRAVIS: 2d6 cold damage.

03:23:47.247 --> 03:23:49.022
MATT: Yes, it does.

03:23:49.022 --> 03:23:51.949
TRAVIS: 11 points of cold damage.

03:23:51.949 --> 03:23:58.160
MATT: 11 points, nice. Slithers out of the
radius.

03:23:58.160 --> 03:23:59.501
SAM: Oh no.

03:23:59.501 --> 03:24:04.278
MATT: Sees Yasha and sees Avantika. Avantika's
handled now by the hydra. He's going to now look

03:24:04.278 --> 03:24:08.290
towards Yasha and take two arrow strikes at her.

03:24:08.290 --> 03:24:09.384
TRAVIS: At Yasha?

03:24:09.384 --> 03:24:10.087
MATT: Yep.

03:24:10.087 --> 03:24:11.589
MARISHA: Wait, the hydra? Or the thing?

03:24:11.589 --> 03:24:12.892
MATT: No, the abomination right there.

03:24:12.892 --> 03:24:14.024
LAURA: Is Yasha raging?

03:24:14.024 --> 03:24:17.503
MATT: No, she's not raging. That is an 18 to hit.

03:24:17.503 --> 03:24:19.853
TRAVIS: That is her armor class.

03:24:19.853 --> 03:24:22.509
TALIESIN: I thought you did rage as a bonus
action. Damn it.

03:24:22.509 --> 03:24:37.847
MATT: And a 19 to hit. She takes six points of
piercing damage and eight points of poison damage.

03:24:39.057 --> 03:24:41.120
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:24:41.417 --> 03:24:45.117
MATT: Second attack is 13 points of piercing
damage.

03:24:45.117 --> 03:24:45.940
TRAVIS: 13?

03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:51.034
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage, and ten points
of poison damage. She got lucky on those rolls

03:24:51.034 --> 03:25:00.292
there. It's going to stay back here in the corner,
trying to keep away. It's just using its arrows

03:25:00.292 --> 03:25:05.756
from a distance. It's starting to show some wear
and tear. This guy over here has been pummelled

03:25:05.756 --> 03:25:10.142
with a few things and the tentacles have been
tearing through him, but he's staying outside of

03:25:10.142 --> 03:25:13.265
the radius of that sphere. That finishes his go.
Fjord, you're up.

03:25:13.265 --> 03:25:30.861
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep. Good shit, good stuff. I'm
going to (tongue clicking) move a little closer to

03:25:30.861 --> 03:25:37.107
the column and I'll send two arcs of Eldritch
Blast towards the--

03:25:37.107 --> 03:25:38.967
MATT: You're moving, you said?

03:25:38.967 --> 03:25:40.699
TRAVIS: Yeah, just closer to Nott.

03:25:40.699 --> 03:25:46.045
MATT: Okay, here. As you're moving in that
direction (whooshing)-- this against the hydra?

03:25:46.045 --> 03:25:47.535
TRAVIS: Yes. 17?

03:25:47.535 --> 03:25:48.387
MATT: That hits.

03:25:48.387 --> 03:25:50.702
TRAVIS: Okay, so second one. Natural 20.

03:25:50.702 --> 03:25:52.294
MATT: Ooh.

03:25:52.294 --> 03:26:08.638
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay. The first one is 12,
second one is nine, 18, 22 points of damage.

03:26:08.975 --> 03:26:14.184
MATT: 22 points of damage. As both bolts slam into
the head, you watch as the head pops.

03:26:14.184 --> 03:26:15.942
LAURA: Oh!

03:26:15.942 --> 03:26:18.274
MATT: Actually blasts them off the hydra.

03:26:18.274 --> 03:26:19.888
LAURA: No way, you can actually pop off a head!

03:26:19.888 --> 03:26:21.520
ALL: Oh!

03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:22.834
TALIESIN: That's so cool.

03:26:22.834 --> 03:26:24.033
LAURA: I like it!

03:26:24.033 --> 03:26:29.164
TRAVIS: Like an idiot, I'll cast, with my bonus
action, Hexblade's Curse on the hydra, which would

03:26:29.164 --> 03:26:34.108
have really made that critical way more awesome,
but I'm flustered.

03:26:34.108 --> 03:26:35.312
MATT: But now you know.

03:26:35.312 --> 03:26:35.879
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:26:35.879 --> 03:26:41.524
MATT: Hexblade's Curse, right there. That brings
us to Caleb.

03:26:41.524 --> 03:26:48.492
LIAM: Ah, <i>Gott.</i> I'm going to lean around the
corner and do what I thought I would do before,

03:26:48.871 --> 03:26:59.149
which is to tug on the Glove of Blasting and fire
the three Scorching Rays. Natural 20 for the first.

03:26:59.149 --> 03:27:00.814
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:27:00.814 --> 03:27:03.156
LIAM: 18 for the second.

03:27:03.156 --> 03:27:04.373
MATT: That hits.

03:27:04.373 --> 03:27:06.098
LIAM: Very high for the third.

03:27:06.098 --> 03:27:10.435
MATT: All right, roll the first 2d6. Double this.

03:27:10.435 --> 03:27:19.284
LIAM: 16. 26. 35 total.

03:27:19.284 --> 03:27:26.700
MATT: 35 points of damage. You watch as another
head gets burnt to cinders. From the nearby

03:27:26.946 --> 03:27:33.520
impact, it actually cauterizes where the first head was
destroyed and where the second one was destroyed.

03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:37.004
LAURA: It needs burning damage or else it's
(popping)..

03:27:37.004 --> 03:27:40.574
LIAM: I will jump back into the hallway because
I'm a coward.

03:27:40.574 --> 03:27:42.274
MATT: All right.

03:27:42.274 --> 03:27:50.249
SAM: Caleb, I think it's a hallucination.
Fluffernutter.

03:27:50.249 --> 03:27:53.468
MATT: That finishes Caleb's turn. It is now Yasha,
Caduceus and Jester's.

03:27:53.468 --> 03:28:00.975
TALIESIN: I'm going to run out into the room. I
want to run out. Can I see both of these creatures?

03:28:01.909 --> 03:28:03.816
MATT: From this position, you cannot.

03:28:03.816 --> 03:28:07.120
TALIESIN: How far would I have to go to see both
of them?

03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:10.472
MATT: Hmm, you'd have to get this way and you
don't have enough-- you could try and leap off

03:28:10.472 --> 03:28:14.179
here. You'd have to make an acrobatics check to
see if you land properly.

03:28:14.179 --> 03:28:16.562
TALIESIN: Shit. I'll just see one of them, then.

03:28:16.562 --> 03:28:22.506
MATT: All right, you step out and see the hydra.
This sphere is preventing you from seeing the abomination.

03:28:23.100 --> 03:28:24.884
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bane.

03:28:24.884 --> 03:28:26.395
MATT: Okay.

03:28:26.395 --> 03:28:30.085
TALIESIN: That's a 16 charisma.

03:28:30.085 --> 03:28:36.664
MATT: Charisma save? No, that is an eight.

03:28:36.664 --> 03:28:38.641
TALIESIN: All right, you know what Bane does?

03:28:38.641 --> 03:28:40.587
MATT: I'm looking it up again.

03:28:40.587 --> 03:28:45.763
TALIESIN: I can tell you. You have to roll a d4
for every attack or saving throw. You roll a d4

03:28:45.763 --> 03:28:47.769
and you subtract that from what you get.

03:28:47.769 --> 03:28:50.092
MATT: Right. You're concentrating on that.

03:28:50.092 --> 03:28:51.806
TALIESIN: I don't even think it is concentration.

03:28:51.806 --> 03:28:53.339
MATT: It is, concentration for up to one minute.

03:28:53.339 --> 03:28:54.124
TALIESIN: Is it?

03:28:54.124 --> 03:28:56.242
MATT: Yep. That is Bane.

03:28:56.242 --> 03:28:59.032
TALIESIN: There's no 'C' on this thing. Oh, there
it is. Never mind, I'm an idiot.

03:28:59.032 --> 03:29:00.616
MATT: Is that where you're staying?

03:29:00.616 --> 03:29:02.459
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to hide back in.

03:29:02.459 --> 03:29:04.629
MATT: All right, pop back out. Healer tactics.

03:29:04.629 --> 03:29:05.972
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:29:05.972 --> 03:29:09.038
MATT: That finishes Caduceus's turn. Jester and
Yasha?

03:29:09.038 --> 03:29:17.446
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to move my duplicate
outside of the tentacles, close to the shitty guy

03:29:17.719 --> 03:29:19.534
that I was fighting before.

03:29:19.534 --> 03:29:23.751
MATT: Let me just double check something as far as
your duplicate is concerned.

03:29:23.751 --> 03:29:26.260
LAURA: Oh, I have to keep a visual.

03:29:26.260 --> 03:29:31.387
MATT: It might be the case, it might not be. I'll
double check here.

03:29:31.387 --> 03:29:34.740
LAURA: It is the case. I didn't think about the
fact when it was in there that I don't have visual

03:29:34.740 --> 03:29:40.261
on it. I would have lost it before I ever cast
that other spell.

03:29:40.261 --> 03:29:45.141
SAM: You got hit with 30 points of damage, too, so
that's concentration.

03:29:45.141 --> 03:29:48.026
LAURA: Oh jesus. I don't know if works like that.

03:29:48.026 --> 03:29:51.461
MATT: No, it just says, you create it for a
minute, it says it's concentration, an unoccupied

03:29:51.461 --> 03:29:55.471
space, you can move the illusion for 30 feet in
space you can see, but it must remain within 120

03:29:55.471 --> 03:29:56.955
feet of you.

03:29:56.955 --> 03:29:57.971
LAURA: Okay, then--

03:29:57.971 --> 03:30:00.403
MATT: But you cannot see any of these spaces where
it is.

03:30:00.403 --> 03:30:03.815
LAURA: Oh, can I move around the corner? Then see
it?

03:30:03.815 --> 03:30:08.244
MATT: You can. Right now it's consumed in
darkness. You cannot see anything past this. The

03:30:08.244 --> 03:30:13.907
Hunger of Hadar is blocking all your vision. You
do not know where your illusion is, you just see

03:30:13.907 --> 03:30:15.264
this large sphere of darkness.

03:30:15.264 --> 03:30:16.452
LAURA: I can't move it at all?

03:30:16.452 --> 03:30:17.008
MATT: Correct.

03:30:17.008 --> 03:30:19.962
LAURA: Great, cool. That was an awesome--

03:30:19.962 --> 03:30:26.000
TALIESIN: I was going to say, would you have spent
that spell? Would she have been able to spend that

03:30:26.000 --> 03:30:27.664
spell? If she couldn't--

03:30:27.664 --> 03:30:29.275
MATT: Technically no, but nevertheless.

03:30:29.275 --> 03:30:30.838
TALIESIN: Nevertheless she did.

03:30:30.838 --> 03:30:36.368
LAURA: Yeah, it happens. I can't move my duplicate
out of the darkness.

03:30:36.368 --> 03:30:40.147
MATT: To a space you can see, you can, but it
would be over on this side.

03:30:40.147 --> 03:30:43.758
LAURA: Can I move it over to Beau? Can I see that
area, over next to Beau?

03:30:43.758 --> 03:30:46.271
MATT: Over next to Beau on this side?

03:30:46.271 --> 03:30:47.234
LAURA: Yeah.

03:30:47.234 --> 03:30:49.110
MATT: You could try to.

03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:50.906
LAURA: Or just like in front of the well?

03:30:50.906 --> 03:30:55.183
MATT: You can get it right there on the cusp,
floating above the top there. It's just peering

03:30:55.183 --> 03:30:57.534
out, and it's visible to you now.

03:30:57.534 --> 03:31:11.924
LAURA: Okay, well at least it's out. I guess right
now I'll just do, jesus christ, Guiding Bolt at

03:31:12.007 --> 03:31:13.702
1st-level on the hydra.

03:31:13.702 --> 03:31:16.174
MATT: Go for it! Roll for an attack.

03:31:19.234 --> 03:31:21.739
LAURA: 16?

03:31:21.739 --> 03:31:23.985
MATT: 16 hits. Roll damage.

03:31:23.985 --> 03:31:34.485
(music)

03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:40.270
LAURA: 12 points of radiant and then next attack
gets advantage on it.

03:31:40.270 --> 03:31:42.971
MATT: You are correct. That finishes your turn.
Yasha?

03:31:42.971 --> 03:31:46.762
LAURA: Then I move out-- I move back.

03:31:46.762 --> 03:31:49.766
MATT: You move back, all right.

03:31:49.766 --> 03:31:51.963
TALIESIN: Smart.

03:31:51.963 --> 03:31:59.446
TRAVIS: Yasha got fucked up and does not care
about Captain Avantika and will move 40 feet

03:31:59.446 --> 03:32:04.954
towards Nott and Fjord that direction.

03:32:04.954 --> 03:32:09.704
MATT: This way? (counting)

03:32:09.704 --> 03:32:18.134
TRAVIS: Great, and will hold a melee attack in
case something comes within her range.

03:32:18.134 --> 03:32:23.097
MATT: Okay, that finishes Yasha's go. Top of the
round. Now the hydra goes.

03:32:23.097 --> 03:32:25.369
TRAVIS: 2d6 cold.

03:32:25.369 --> 03:32:30.708
MATT: The hydra spins around to face Beau who has
now moved up.

03:32:30.708 --> 03:32:32.344
TRAVIS: Nine points of cold damage.

03:32:32.344 --> 03:32:38.183
MATT: Now only three functional heads, it's going
to take three swipes at Beau.

03:32:38.183 --> 03:32:40.228
MARISHA: At disadvantage.

03:32:40.228 --> 03:32:46.190
TALIESIN: They need the d4 and at disadvantage.
I've never used Bane. I should really start using Bane.

03:32:46.974 --> 03:32:56.284
MATT: (laughter) Double natural ones! That's
impressive. Minus three!

03:32:56.284 --> 03:32:59.126
TRAVIS: Needed that.

03:32:59.126 --> 03:33:04.034
MATT: That's a 12?

03:33:04.034 --> 03:33:05.514
MARISHA: Miss!

03:33:05.514 --> 03:33:07.235
TALIESIN: Bane!

03:33:07.235 --> 03:33:08.689
TRAVIS: Yeah, more of that.

03:33:08.689 --> 03:33:10.052
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:33:10.052 --> 03:33:12.348
MATT: That's 21.

03:33:12.348 --> 03:33:14.115
MARISHA: With Bane?

03:33:14.115 --> 03:33:15.557
MATT: With Bane.

03:33:15.557 --> 03:33:17.070
MARISHA: (coughing) Hits.

03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:25.074
MATT: You take 15 points of piercing damage as it
suddenly-- two heads you manage to dodge by,

03:33:25.074 --> 03:33:28.463
there's one that was moving too quick that you
didn't see coming and--

03:33:28.463 --> 03:33:30.153
LIAM: Your AC is two higher.

03:33:30.153 --> 03:33:33.860
MARISHA: Ooh! You're right, my AC is two higher,
what did you say? Oh, 21?

03:33:33.860 --> 03:33:34.557
MATT: 21.

03:33:34.557 --> 03:33:35.878
MARISHA: 21 is the AC.

03:33:35.878 --> 03:33:39.619
MATT: Then it still hits you. Bites you in the
side, lifts you off the ground from the impact and

03:33:39.619 --> 03:33:44.434
you feel the teeth crunch into your abdomen. You
manage to elbow your way out and land, and you can

03:33:44.434 --> 03:33:48.360
see the fresh teeth marks starting to bleed down
the side.

03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:49.967
TALIESIN: You doing okay?

03:33:49.967 --> 03:33:54.505
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:33:54.505 --> 03:34:03.529
MATT: It's going to move out and into range with
both of them, right there.

03:34:03.529 --> 03:34:07.855
MARISHA: Shoot, the Captain.

03:34:07.855 --> 03:34:09.943
LIAM: She didn't want an attack of opportunity?

03:34:09.943 --> 03:34:11.423
MATT: She's not within range.

03:34:11.423 --> 03:34:12.473
LIAM: She's not? Oh.

03:34:12.473 --> 03:34:13.808
MATT: No, they have a reach of ten.

03:34:13.808 --> 03:34:16.427
LIAM: I thought she was right up. Okay.

03:34:16.427 --> 03:34:20.431
MATT: All right, so that's going to bring us to
Beau. You're up.

03:34:20.431 --> 03:34:29.376
MARISHA: Okay, I want to parkour off of this
pillar that I'm next to, and come down with a

03:34:29.376 --> 03:34:43.159
giant Superman pop! Just go for him. Two attacks.
First attack, I'll take that 13 and 14, plus seven

03:34:43.159 --> 03:34:52.792
so 19-- or, 20 and 21, you're right. With my first
one I want to do a stunning strike to it. No--

03:34:52.792 --> 03:34:56.252
yeah. First attack, stunning strike.

03:34:56.252 --> 03:35:00.694
TALIESIN: There's a d4 negative also.

03:35:00.694 --> 03:35:01.836
MATT: That's true, yeah.

03:35:01.836 --> 03:35:03.874
MARISHA: Oh my god, please.

03:35:03.874 --> 03:35:05.358
MATT: That lowers it to 16.

03:35:05.358 --> 03:35:07.301
MARISHA: Nope! No, he saves.

03:35:07.301 --> 03:35:08.897
MATT: Plus five on his con.

03:35:08.897 --> 03:35:12.375
MARISHA: Plus five on his con? That's great to
know.

03:35:12.375 --> 03:35:16.302
SAM: Didn't you do something that makes it more
vulnerable to its next hit?

03:35:16.763 --> 03:35:19.267
LAURA: Oh yeah! Advantage, she gets advantage on
the next hit.

03:35:19.267 --> 03:35:21.353
MATT: Roll one more dice, just in case it's a
crit.

03:35:21.353 --> 03:35:24.579
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. It's not a crit.

03:35:24.579 --> 03:35:25.933
MATT: There you go.

03:35:25.933 --> 03:35:31.335
MARISHA: That's definitely worse. With those two
hits, I want to do extract aspects. I already know

03:35:31.335 --> 03:35:33.374
its con is plus five.

03:35:33.374 --> 03:35:35.199
MATT: Gave you that to you as a freebie.

03:35:35.199 --> 03:35:40.793
MARISHA: Yeah, you did, thank you for the DM slip.
What's its wisdom saving throw?

03:35:40.793 --> 03:35:42.823
MATT: Plus zero.

03:35:42.823 --> 03:35:55.994
MARISHA: Wisdom save is plus zero. He's not smart!
Or wise, whatever. And if he has any-- do we want

03:35:55.994 --> 03:35:58.670
vulnerabilities or resistances?!

03:35:58.670 --> 03:36:00.193
LAURA and SAM: Just do--

03:36:00.193 --> 03:36:02.604
MARISHA: Vulnerabilities! What's his
vulnerabilities?

03:36:02.604 --> 03:36:04.637
MATT: No vulnerability for the hydra.

03:36:04.637 --> 03:36:12.860
MARISHA: Not vulnerable to shit! Then, I have one
more attack because of haste. Attacking again.

03:36:12.860 --> 03:36:15.402
That's a natural 16, pretty sure that hits.

03:36:15.402 --> 03:36:17.354
MATT: Yeah.

03:36:17.354 --> 03:36:23.826
MARISHA: I'm going to use my staff. That's
terrible. Six.

03:36:23.826 --> 03:36:25.976
MATT: Six points of damage there.

03:36:25.976 --> 03:36:30.805
MARISHA: I'm going to spend another ki point and
do flurry of blows and do two more hits.

03:36:30.805 --> 03:36:33.253
MATT: Go for it.

03:36:33.253 --> 03:36:37.592
MARISHA: One's an eight, so 15 for one.

03:36:37.592 --> 03:36:38.972
MATT: 15 hits.

03:36:38.972 --> 03:36:43.268
MARISHA: Then the other is an 11.

03:36:43.268 --> 03:36:45.502
MATT: That misses. You have one more hit.

03:36:45.502 --> 03:36:49.568
MARISHA: Terrible again. Six points of damage.

03:36:49.568 --> 03:36:55.631
MATT: Rolling series of strikes, you pull some
information from it. Manages to pummel the sides

03:36:55.631 --> 03:36:59.987
of this base where its torso is. Well done. Does
that end your turn?

03:36:59.987 --> 03:37:04.630
MARISHA: I communicate: His wisdom save sucks,
it's a plus zero. His constitution is a plus five.

03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:09.990
No vulnerabilities. No, I'm not moving.

03:37:09.990 --> 03:37:14.106
MATT: Okay, you stay where you are. That brings us
to Nott.

03:37:14.106 --> 03:37:29.168
SAM: Nott the Brave yells to her teammates: The
colors are so vivid! Then also: Everyone back up,

03:37:29.168 --> 03:37:39.087
we're going to Fluffernutter this bitch! I will
(cocking crossbow) and hold my action.

03:37:39.087 --> 03:37:40.668
MATT: With your explosive bolt?

03:37:40.668 --> 03:37:41.474
SAM: Yeah.

03:37:41.474 --> 03:37:42.883
MATT: Okay.

03:37:42.883 --> 03:37:48.746
SAM: Ah! Waiting for a keg to be thrown.

03:37:48.746 --> 03:37:53.348
MATT: All righty. You're holding your action.

03:37:53.348 --> 03:37:55.992
TRAVIS: That's a wasted action.

03:37:55.992 --> 03:37:58.181
SAM: (cocking crossbow) Fluffernutter!

03:37:58.181 --> 03:38:07.168
MATT: It is now the abomination's turn. The
abomination-- or Avantika's turn.

03:38:07.168 --> 03:38:11.386
TALIESIN: Also, the little--

03:38:11.386 --> 03:38:12.744
MATT: I feel like I forgot Avantika's turn.

03:38:12.744 --> 03:38:14.069
TALIESIN: Avantika and--

03:38:14.069 --> 03:38:18.992
MATT: And Jamedi. Avantika would have darted
around and gotten into melee with the hydra.

03:38:18.992 --> 03:38:23.625
SAM: I don't care about Avantika.

03:38:23.625 --> 03:38:29.034
TRAVIS: You've got the keg, right? Thank god,
there's another checks and balances to that crazy.

03:38:29.411 --> 03:38:41.310
MATT: Ooh, nice. Natural 20 on one of those hits.
That's a-- (counting) 22 points of damage to it.

03:38:41.310 --> 03:38:44.343
TRAVIS: 22 points of damage to it?!

03:38:44.343 --> 03:38:46.063
MATT: Correct, from Avantika.

03:38:46.063 --> 03:38:48.712
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! From the two strikes to it? Her
rapier, or--?

03:38:48.712 --> 03:38:54.687
MATT: Yeah, those were two rapier strikes.
Finishes her go. Jamedi is just shaking and not

03:38:54.687 --> 03:39:01.147
even getting involved in the combat. Too scared to
go in. That brings us to the abomination's turn,

03:39:01.147 --> 03:39:04.583
who's going to turn around the corner, rise up on
the platform here--

03:39:04.583 --> 03:39:07.060
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. What's it doing?

03:39:07.060 --> 03:39:08.297
LIAM: Fastball special.

03:39:08.297 --> 03:39:10.753
MARISHA: I was about to pee, but not-- did it
move?

03:39:10.753 --> 03:39:13.215
MATT: That's a good thing, yeah, because it turned
around and it's going to take two shots at you

03:39:13.215 --> 03:39:14.269
with its longbow.

03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:16.120
MARISHA: Cool, cool, cool.

03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:17.975
SAM: You're Patient Defense-ing, right? You're
fine.

03:39:17.975 --> 03:39:19.860
MARISHA: Nope, not this round.

03:39:19.860 --> 03:39:22.352
MATT: That is 15.

03:39:22.352 --> 03:39:25.922
MARISHA: Miss. He's shooting at me?

03:39:25.922 --> 03:39:27.422
MATT: And 23.

03:39:27.422 --> 03:39:32.769
MARISHA: 23? I'm going to use deflect missiles and
take that-- minus d10 to--

03:39:32.769 --> 03:39:37.102
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage?

03:39:37.102 --> 03:39:41.042
MARISHA: All of it's negated by deflect missiles.

03:39:41.042 --> 03:39:44.351
MATT: Including 12 points of poison damage.

03:39:44.351 --> 03:39:45.617
TALIESIN: Which you are--

03:39:45.617 --> 03:39:46.748
MARISHA: I'm resistant to.

03:39:46.748 --> 03:39:48.420
MATT: Correct. So you take six.

03:39:48.420 --> 03:40:03.919
MARISHA: Okay. I will go ahead-- My deflect-- I
guess not, it's poison, it's not going to-- I'll

03:40:03.919 --> 03:40:04.955
still take that--

03:40:04.955 --> 03:40:11.810
MATT: Well, here-- you resisted all of the damage
from the arrow entirely. That's pretty slick.

03:40:11.810 --> 03:40:17.878
Yeah, it doesn't even catch you. No poison. You
manage to stop it in place. The poison doesn't

03:40:17.878 --> 03:40:19.641
even hit your system.

03:40:19.641 --> 03:40:26.218
MARISHA: I'm going to-- I'm going to not spend the
ki point.

03:40:26.218 --> 03:40:29.493
MATT: Watching you reach behind and catch the
arrow and stop it from going there, and the second

03:40:29.493 --> 03:40:34.240
one just manages to dodge past you. (growling)
It's going to go ahead and--

03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:37.155
MARISHA: I look at him and I take the arrow and
go--

03:40:37.155 --> 03:40:40.559
MATT: That's when you take the 2d6.

03:40:40.559 --> 03:40:49.386
MARISHA: No! Resistance! (spitting)

03:40:49.386 --> 03:40:55.027
MATT: Spitting it out on the side, your lips and
tongue go a little numb. All right, that ends its

03:40:55.027 --> 03:40:57.098
go. Fjord, you're up and then Caleb you're on
deck.

03:40:57.098 --> 03:41:04.507
TRAVIS: I'll use the 30 feet of Fjord's movement
to go around the pillar, preserve this line of

03:41:04.507 --> 03:41:11.920
sight with the hydra. I'll unleash two Eldritch
Blasts at it. That's an 18 to hit.

03:41:11.920 --> 03:41:13.139
MATT: 18 hits.

03:41:13.139 --> 03:41:23.080
TRAVIS: One. That's terrible. That's 13 points of
Eldritch Blast energy. Oh, I'm sorry, wait. Just

03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:31.667
checking. Plus three, so 16 points, with the
additional three. That will be--

03:41:31.667 --> 03:41:35.081
MATT: You're concentrating on that. I forgot about
that.

03:41:35.081 --> 03:41:43.227
TRAVIS: Fuck. I should have said it first. That's
it, that's my turn.

03:41:43.227 --> 03:41:46.140
MATT: Did you add your extra damage for your
Hexblade's Curse?

03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:50.593
TRAVIS: Yeah. That was the plus three to damage. I
forgot to do something else. I'll do it next time.

03:41:50.593 --> 03:41:52.494
MATT: That finishes your turn, Fjord. Caleb,
you're up.

03:41:52.494 --> 03:41:58.920
LIAM: I'm going to do a little bit of a gamble
here. I peek out again and I drop Haste on

03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:07.114
Beauregard and smear molasses across my hand and
cast Slow on the hydra and his little snakey friend.

03:42:08.634 --> 03:42:10.169
MATT: All righty.

03:42:10.169 --> 03:42:11.371
TRAVIS: What'd you cast?

03:42:11.371 --> 03:42:17.466
LIAM: Slow. They have to beat a 16. They've got
Bane, or the hydra's got Bane.

03:42:17.466 --> 03:42:20.069
MATT: Well, this would be concentration,
regardless.

03:42:20.069 --> 03:42:21.181
LIAM: Yeah.

03:42:21.181 --> 03:42:26.202
MATT: The abomination, that is a natural 12 plus
two, that's a 14. What's your DC?

03:42:26.202 --> 03:42:31.180
LIAM: 16. The Bane's on hydra.

03:42:31.180 --> 03:42:32.388
MATT: For the hydra--

03:42:32.388 --> 03:42:33.703
LIAM: Come on motherfucker.

03:42:33.703 --> 03:42:34.971
MATT: It's a natural 18--

03:42:34.971 --> 03:42:36.742
LIAM: (whispering) Fuck me.

03:42:36.742 --> 03:42:39.623
MATT: Minus three for the Bane. That's 15.

03:42:39.623 --> 03:42:41.126
TALIESIN: Fuck you, hydra!

03:42:41.126 --> 03:42:46.413
LIAM: Part of the Slow spell is that, regardless
of the creature's abilities or magic items it

03:42:46.413 --> 03:42:52.427
can't make more than one melee or ranged attack
during its turn. It's lost all its head attacks.

03:42:52.427 --> 03:42:53.625
It gets one attack.

03:42:53.625 --> 03:43:01.259
TALIESIN: Oh! That a fucker's, oh! Okay. Things
can still go wrong.

03:43:01.259 --> 03:43:03.018
LIAM: Cad!

03:43:03.018 --> 03:43:04.359
SAM: What else does Slow do?

03:43:04.359 --> 03:43:05.623
LIAM: I've dropped Haste on you.

03:43:05.623 --> 03:43:06.501
MARISHA: No!

03:43:06.501 --> 03:43:08.318
LIAM: I've Slowed the hydra.

03:43:08.318 --> 03:43:09.313
TALIESIN: And the other one.

03:43:09.313 --> 03:43:10.393
LAURA: One attack.

03:43:10.393 --> 03:43:11.493
MARISHA: With a wisdom save?

03:43:11.493 --> 03:43:15.282
LIAM: It worked, yeah. With Caduceus' Bane we got
it. It almost didn't make it, but with Bane it

03:43:15.282 --> 03:43:15.893
made it.

03:43:15.893 --> 03:43:17.373
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:43:17.373 --> 03:43:19.871
TALIESIN: That went well.

03:43:19.871 --> 03:43:21.326
LIAM: (as Bane) Oh, hydra!

03:43:21.326 --> 03:43:24.061
MATT: This ends Caleb's go. That brings us to--

03:43:24.061 --> 03:43:25.571
LIAM: Caleb's hiding.

03:43:25.571 --> 03:43:31.365
MATT: Caleb moves off to the side. Yasha,
Caduceus, and Jester?

03:43:31.365 --> 03:43:33.135
TALIESIN: Jester, you first.

03:43:33.135 --> 03:43:36.663
SAM: It can't use reactions!

03:43:36.663 --> 03:43:40.209
TALIESIN: No reactions, none of them.

03:43:40.209 --> 03:43:41.721
LAURA: Should I do it?

03:43:41.721 --> 03:43:45.943
TALIESIN: I mean, no, because, I mean-- (groans)

03:43:45.943 --> 03:43:47.590
LAURA: Should I do it?

03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:49.550
SAM: Aim high!

03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:52.451
LAURA: Nott told me to do this.

03:43:52.451 --> 03:43:54.377
SAM: (cocking crossbow)

03:43:54.377 --> 03:43:55.760
LAURA: Fluffernutter!

03:43:55.760 --> 03:43:57.321
SAM: (yelling)

03:43:57.321 --> 03:43:59.179
LAURA: I throw it. But I throw it high.

03:43:59.179 --> 03:44:02.870
MATT: Jester steps out to the side. Throw it
high.

03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:04.231
LAURA: Towards the heads.

03:44:04.231 --> 03:44:06.064
MATT: Make a strength check.

03:44:06.064 --> 03:44:09.101
LIAM: (quietly) Don't roll a one.

03:44:09.101 --> 03:44:13.155
LAURA: Shut up! Don't curse it! 11.

03:44:13.155 --> 03:44:17.436
MATT: Nott, roll an attack roll.

03:44:17.436 --> 03:44:22.721
SAM: Do I get any advantages?

03:44:22.721 --> 03:44:24.957
MATT: No, you do not.

03:44:24.957 --> 03:44:26.351
SAM: 12.

03:44:26.351 --> 03:44:30.077
LAURA: We're almost in sync here.

03:44:30.077 --> 03:44:52.978
MATT: So. (laughing) The barrel (whooshing). The bolt (arrow
firing) and detonates somewhere on the opposite side

03:44:52.978 --> 03:44:58.994
of the chamber as the barrel (landing) into the
water of the well in the center there. You hear a

03:44:58.994 --> 03:45:00.690
splash of water.

03:45:00.690 --> 03:45:05.583
TALIESIN: It's good that we burned those two
actions for that; I feel like that was a good use.

03:45:07.043 --> 03:45:08.833
MATT: That would've been spectacular if it had
worked.

03:45:08.833 --> 03:45:10.494
TALIESIN: That would've been--

03:45:10.494 --> 03:45:13.306
LAURA: That didn't go as well as I had hoped.

03:45:13.306 --> 03:45:15.537
TALIESIN: That was about as disappointing--

03:45:15.537 --> 03:45:19.054
SAM and LAURA: (shouting) Fluffernutter!

03:45:19.054 --> 03:45:21.826
TALIESIN: If you've ever had fluffernutter, that's
about the flavor of it.

03:45:21.826 --> 03:45:23.287
MATT: There you go.

03:45:23.287 --> 03:45:31.894
LAURA: For my bonus action, I'm going to move my
duplicate out and stand next to Avantika.

03:45:31.894 --> 03:45:33.623
MATT: All righty.

03:45:33.623 --> 03:45:44.984
LAURA: She can't really do anything because I used
my action. She's just going to stare at Avantika.

03:45:44.984 --> 03:45:48.749
MATT: Okay, got it. That finishes that turn.
Caduceus?

03:45:48.749 --> 03:45:53.880
LAURA: I'm going to hide around the corner and for
my move, the rest of my movement.

03:45:53.880 --> 03:46:01.639
TALIESIN: Yasha, are we--? I'm going to yell down
to Yasha: I know what he's vulnerable to. I'm

03:46:01.639 --> 03:46:08.442
going peek out and cast my Path to the Grave
before Yasha's turn on the hydra.

03:46:08.442 --> 03:46:11.059
LAURA: Whoa.

03:46:11.059 --> 03:46:18.625
TALIESIN: It's now vulnerable to <i>everything</i>. The
next hit is double damage. It's what we did last

03:46:18.625 --> 03:46:21.139
time. Next hit is double damage, I'm back to
hiding.

03:46:21.139 --> 03:46:22.270
MATT: To Yasha.

03:46:22.270 --> 03:46:24.328
TRAVIS: Now she would like to <i>ragé</i>.

03:46:24.328 --> 03:46:25.525
MATT: There you go.

03:46:25.525 --> 03:46:26.883
TALIESIN: Just plow.

03:46:26.883 --> 03:46:30.794
MATT: She is flanking with Avantika, yes.

03:46:30.794 --> 03:46:34.327
TALIESIN: So auto-advantage.

03:46:34.327 --> 03:46:36.186
TRAVIS: I don't have to do reckless?

03:46:36.186 --> 03:46:38.300
MATT: Correct, you don't have to. You can if you
want to.

03:46:38.300 --> 03:46:49.850
TRAVIS: Divine thing on the first one. That's only
a 14 on the first one?

03:46:49.850 --> 03:46:52.805
MATT: 14 misses. Goes wide, second strike.

03:46:52.805 --> 03:46:56.627
TRAVIS: Fuck. 16.

03:46:56.627 --> 03:46:58.920
MATT: 16 does hit. 15 was the threshold.

03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:00.963
TALIESIN: It's okay, it's still holding.

03:47:00.963 --> 03:47:02.422
MATT: Yeah, and she still does her divine damage.

03:47:02.422 --> 03:47:03.832
TRAVIS: It's the first one that hits, right.

03:47:03.832 --> 03:47:05.214
TALIESIN: You still have it, though.

03:47:05.214 --> 03:47:14.285
TRAVIS: (counting) 16 points.

03:47:14.285 --> 03:47:22.271
MATT: Doubled, so it's 32 points of damage.
Another head is carved off of its body.

03:47:22.271 --> 03:47:28.026
LAURA: Now we have to burn the head with the--
aww, it would've been so great if we would've succeeded.

03:47:28.369 --> 03:47:29.895
SAM: Would've been fucking amazing.

03:47:29.895 --> 03:47:32.071
MARISHA: Cauterized all of the head wounds.

03:47:32.071 --> 03:47:33.704
MATT: That ends Yasha's go?

03:47:33.704 --> 03:47:34.147
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:47:34.147 --> 03:47:41.307
MATT: It's now Avantika's turn, Avantika is going
to take three strikes at it. The rapier-- both

03:47:41.307 --> 03:47:55.774
hit, 18 and 11 naturally. The dagger misses with a
four. Oh shit. (counting) 25 points of damage.

03:47:55.774 --> 03:47:57.847
TALIESIN: She can also back off without
repercussions.

03:47:57.847 --> 03:48:00.981
SAM: Liam, we ended the last round, did
Fluffernutter, we won.

03:48:00.981 --> 03:48:10.844
MATT: 25 points of damage from Avantika carves off
another head. There is now one head on the hydra.

03:48:10.844 --> 03:48:14.025
LAURA: We have to burn the heads.

03:48:14.025 --> 03:48:22.868
MATT: Next up is Jamedi, who's staying out of the
fray. Next is the hydra's turn. The hydra, who

03:48:22.868 --> 03:48:30.149
only has one head, but is slowed and can only make
one attack anyway, is going to swing back to you

03:48:30.149 --> 03:48:33.208
since you're the one who looks the most damaged
too and it wants to start taking something down.

03:48:33.208 --> 03:48:34.471
MARISHA: To him?

03:48:34.471 --> 03:48:35.834
MATT: No, against you.

03:48:35.834 --> 03:48:37.105
MARISHA: Oh.

03:48:37.105 --> 03:48:39.556
TRAVIS: Does Sentinel engage there?

03:48:39.556 --> 03:48:44.729
MARISHA: From Yasha, yeah, if it's attacking
something else other than her.

03:48:44.729 --> 03:48:47.452
MATT: Ooh, that's a natural 20 against you.

03:48:47.452 --> 03:48:53.240
TALIESIN: Is that a natural 20 against you?
(counting) Oh. Can I see from my vantage or can I not?

03:48:53.749 --> 03:48:55.358
MATT: No, you specifically got out of sight.

03:48:55.358 --> 03:48:57.445
TRAVIS: Does Sentinel come after the attack or
before the attack?

03:48:57.445 --> 03:48:58.681
MARISHA: It's a reaction.

03:48:58.681 --> 03:49:01.865
MATT: It happens as it happens, so roll for
Yasha.

03:49:01.865 --> 03:49:04.062
TRAVIS: She's going to do it reckless.

03:49:04.062 --> 03:49:05.664
MATT: She can't reckless out of turn.

03:49:05.664 --> 03:49:08.030
TRAVIS: Oh, I got you. Shit, I don't remember what
it was when I picked it up.

03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:09.433
MATT: It's all good.

03:49:09.433 --> 03:49:12.545
TRAVIS: Be level! It's a 15.

03:49:12.545 --> 03:49:24.584
MATT: 15 just hits. Roll damage for Yasha. That's
cocked. That is 18 points of piercing damage to

03:49:24.584 --> 03:49:25.843
you, Beau.

03:49:25.843 --> 03:49:26.560
MARISHA: 18?

03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:27.673
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:49:27.673 --> 03:49:29.896
TRAVIS: 17 points of--

03:49:29.896 --> 03:49:32.956
MATT: Nice. It's starting to look hurt.

03:49:32.956 --> 03:49:35.133
TALIESIN: How are you feeling?

03:49:35.133 --> 03:49:40.739
MARISHA: I'll let you know. Not great. Double
digits, but barely, once again.

03:49:40.739 --> 03:49:44.034
TALIESIN: All right, that'll do. The problem is
the fucker behind you.

03:49:44.034 --> 03:49:50.481
MATT: Hold on a second. At the end of its turn--
ah! End of its turn, it grows two heads for each

03:49:50.481 --> 03:49:53.997
of its heads that died since its last turn unless
it's taken fire damage. Since it was slowed and

03:49:53.997 --> 03:49:58.722
did not take fire damage, it regrows four new
heads.

03:49:58.722 --> 03:50:00.768
SAM: Four new heads?!

03:50:00.768 --> 03:50:02.950
LIAM: Can it do that because it can only do one
action?

03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:06.267
MATT: It's a natural ability. It's not an action.
It just happens at the end of its roll.

03:50:06.267 --> 03:50:08.271
SAM: Wait, even the ones that were cauterized?

03:50:08.271 --> 03:50:13.151
MATT: No, the cauterized ones are still gone, but
the two that it lost last turn--

03:50:13.151 --> 03:50:17.216
SAM: Grew back as four?

03:50:17.216 --> 03:50:18.104
MATT: Yes.

03:50:18.104 --> 03:50:20.127
MARISHA: It's a hydra!

03:50:20.127 --> 03:50:22.922
SAM: I don't know what a hydra is. I'm not a
dork.

03:50:22.922 --> 03:50:24.867
MARISHA: It's Greek mythology!

03:50:24.867 --> 03:50:29.601
MATT: It makes a wisdom save against the Slow,
right?

03:50:29.601 --> 03:50:33.426
LAURA: We could do it like Hercules and just keep
making it reproduce!

03:50:33.426 --> 03:50:37.237
MATT: At the end of its turn? Natural 17!

03:50:37.237 --> 03:50:38.664
TALIESIN: Minus?

03:50:38.664 --> 03:50:43.696
MATT: Oh, right, yeah! This could do it! Minus
one-- 16. What's the DC?

03:50:43.696 --> 03:50:47.436
LIAM: It's 16. "Each target must succeed on a
wisdom saving throw or be affected by the spell

03:50:47.436 --> 03:50:49.315
for the duration."

03:50:49.315 --> 03:50:50.687
MATT: At the end of the spell?

03:50:50.687 --> 03:50:58.275
LIAM: I'm not seeing that. I'm going to look in
the book. I don't see it.

03:50:58.275 --> 03:51:01.170
MATT: "A creature affected by the spell makes
another wisdom saving throw at the end of its

03:51:01.170 --> 03:51:03.997
"turn. On a successful save, the effect ends."

03:51:03.997 --> 03:51:06.466
LIAM: It just failed because of Bane, right?

03:51:06.466 --> 03:51:08.714
MATT: No, what's your spell DC?

03:51:08.714 --> 03:51:10.042
LIAM: 16.

03:51:10.042 --> 03:51:11.872
MATT: It succeeds the save.

03:51:11.872 --> 03:51:13.246
MARISHA: Wait, with Bane?

03:51:13.246 --> 03:51:19.980
MATT: I just rolled. It was a one on the d4. It
brought it from 17 to 16. He succeeded. The Slow

03:51:19.980 --> 03:51:27.997
fails and it does regenerate some hit points from
regaining the two heads back. All right. That ends

03:51:27.997 --> 03:51:31.035
the hydra's turn. Beau, you're up.

03:51:31.035 --> 03:51:42.080
MARISHA: Okay! Oh god. I see it grow more heads
and I'm like: Cool, cool, cool. I'm going to reach

03:51:42.276 --> 03:51:50.442
up and I'm going to bash two of its heads
together! Then do a little bit of speed bag action!

03:51:50.442 --> 03:51:52.002
MATT: Go for it.

03:51:52.002 --> 03:51:55.757
TALIESIN: Technically, isn't it flanked right now,
too?

03:51:55.757 --> 03:52:00.417
MATT: Not from Beau, it's not. Yasha and Avantika
are flanking.

03:52:00.417 --> 03:52:05.470
MARISHA: First attack. Yep, that's good. 21!

03:52:05.470 --> 03:52:06.786
MATT: 21 hits!

03:52:06.786 --> 03:52:13.762
MARISHA: I'm going to use my staff for this main
hand. That's-- cool. Five damage. Next attack:

03:52:13.762 --> 03:52:16.166
terrible. 12.

03:52:16.166 --> 03:52:18.938
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately.

03:52:18.938 --> 03:52:26.447
MARISHA: That's my two attacks. Patient Defense.

03:52:26.447 --> 03:52:29.601
MATT: Okay.

03:52:29.601 --> 03:52:32.149
TRAVIS: Where is Avantika and Jamedi in the
initiative order?

03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:34.140
MATT: Avantika and Jamedi are at the very bottom.

03:52:34.140 --> 03:52:38.261
TRAVIS: At the very bottom, they were? They should
probably go before Beau then, right? Because this

03:52:38.261 --> 03:52:40.372
is the beginning of a new round.

03:52:40.372 --> 03:52:42.814
MATT: She already went. She was the one who cut
off one of the heads and then it came back.

03:52:42.814 --> 03:52:46.144
MARISHA: Terrible round. Done for me.

03:52:46.144 --> 03:52:49.080
MATT: Patient Defense for Beau. That brings us to
Nott.

03:52:49.080 --> 03:52:52.345
SAM: Me?! We just did Fluffernutter!

03:52:52.345 --> 03:52:56.171
MATT: Yep. It's still over there in the darkness
somewhere.

03:52:56.171 --> 03:52:59.172
SAM: Is your dark spell still up so we can't see
anything?

03:52:59.172 --> 03:53:01.964
TALIESIN: No, we can-- Oh, not on that side of
things, but you see the other side.

03:53:01.964 --> 03:53:03.711
SAM: Well, that's where it went.

03:53:03.711 --> 03:53:04.557
TALIESIN: It's wet.

03:53:04.557 --> 03:53:05.872
LAURA: Yeah, it's wet.

03:53:05.872 --> 03:53:07.610
SAM: It's not wet.

03:53:07.610 --> 03:53:12.902
LAURA: The keg is wet.

03:53:12.902 --> 03:53:14.048
SAM: You mean kegs that hold beer and wine and are
completely waterproof?

03:53:14.048 --> 03:53:17.477
LAURA: That's true.

03:53:17.477 --> 03:53:22.464
TALIESIN: Unless it cracked from throwing it.

03:53:22.464 --> 03:53:27.049
SAM: I will stick my head out and shoot the
hydra.

03:53:27.049 --> 03:53:28.034
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack. I was hoping
Fluffernutter was going to work.

03:53:28.034 --> 03:53:29.528
LAURA: I know.

03:53:29.528 --> 03:53:30.767
MATT: I'm so sorry.

03:53:30.767 --> 03:53:31.668
SAM: 13.

03:53:31.668 --> 03:53:32.792
MATT: 13 misses, it goes wide.

03:53:32.792 --> 03:53:34.229
SAM: Wait! I'm hidden.

03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:37.244
MATT: You are hidden! You have advantage on that.

03:53:37.244 --> 03:53:37.833
SAM: 18!

03:53:37.833 --> 03:53:40.687
MATT: 18 does hit, so roll damage.

03:53:41.079 --> 03:53:43.364
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I'm getting nervous. Got to
admit, I'm getting nervous. I'm running out of

03:53:43.364 --> 03:53:44.761
cool shit to do.

03:53:44.761 --> 03:53:47.499
SAM: (counting) Oh 23!

03:53:47.499 --> 03:53:55.861
MATT: 23? Ooh, nice! All right. It takes the
damage. It sinks into one of the necks. Its body

03:53:55.861 --> 03:54:04.518
is taking wounds heavily. It's hurt. It's not on
the edge of its life, but it's hurt. That finishes

03:54:04.518 --> 03:54:06.722
Nott's turn. It's now the abomination's turn.

03:54:06.722 --> 03:54:08.350
SAM: Bonus action, I hide again.

03:54:08.350 --> 03:54:11.550
LIAM: He is slowed still. So half speed.

03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:18.504
MATT: Correct. He is going to go ahead and-- can't
take a reaction, right?

03:54:18.504 --> 03:54:23.612
LIAM: No reactions and it can only do an action or
a bonus action, not both, and only one attack.

03:54:23.612 --> 03:54:33.649
MATT: Oh man. The only one close enough to do
anything is Beau. It's going to sweep up behind

03:54:33.649 --> 03:54:37.948
Beau and take one giant swing with its scimitar at
you.

03:54:37.948 --> 03:54:39.436
TRAVIS: It's staying out of that bubble?

03:54:39.436 --> 03:54:42.414
MATT: With disadvantage. Yes, staying just on the
cusp of the bubble. Disadvantage because of

03:54:42.414 --> 03:54:49.527
Patient Defense. Which is good you did because its
was a natural 20 and then a five. That brings it

03:54:49.527 --> 03:54:56.958
to 12. It totally misses. It swings wide. It would
have been a head cleaving blow and out of the

03:54:56.958 --> 03:55:01.439
corner of your eye you see it with your Patient
Defense ready and watch it slowly carve past,

03:55:01.439 --> 03:55:04.500
catching a couple hairs on the side of your head
as you duck out of the way.

03:55:04.500 --> 03:55:07.648
MARISHA: Yeah, slow-mo style. Fwoom. Ting.

03:55:07.648 --> 03:55:09.469
LIAM: Touches up your undercut.

03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:15.894
MARISHA: Yeah. Ooh. Got a nice Erika Ishii zig-zag
pattern now in my undercut.

03:55:15.894 --> 03:55:21.499
MATT: Then it makes a wisdom save to see if it can
to see if it can resist that. Natural 11 plus two.

03:55:21.499 --> 03:55:28.009
13. No, still slowed. Man! That fucks him up, too,
bad. That ends his go. Fjord, you're up.

03:55:28.009 --> 03:55:33.060
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'll cast Hex at the
hydra, dropping the--

03:55:33.060 --> 03:55:34.708
MATT: Dropping the Hunger of Hadar.

03:55:34.708 --> 03:55:36.327
TRAVIS: The bubble.

03:55:36.327 --> 03:55:40.813
MATT: Correct. Now the chamber is visible.

03:55:40.813 --> 03:55:50.122
TRAVIS: Yes. Now, I will fire two Eldritch Blasts
at the hydra with Hex on top. That's only a 12.

03:55:50.122 --> 03:55:51.357
MATT: That hits.

03:55:51.357 --> 03:55:55.595
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20. You said the first
one hits?

03:55:55.595 --> 03:55:56.452
MATT: What did you roll?

03:55:56.452 --> 03:55:57.562
TRAVIS: It was a 12.

03:55:57.562 --> 03:55:59.418
MATT: 12? No. It misses.

03:55:59.418 --> 03:56:04.158
TRAVIS: Nine. 18.

03:56:04.158 --> 03:56:06.181
MARISHA: <i>Nein</i>.

03:56:06.181 --> 03:56:07.720
LIAM: Get it, F-jord.

03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:09.947
TRAVIS: 18 plus four.

03:56:09.947 --> 03:56:10.685
LAURA: 22.

03:56:10.685 --> 03:56:16.657
TRAVIS: 22, thank you. Plus 1d6 for Hex. Four. So
26.

03:56:16.657 --> 03:56:18.673
LAURA: Did you double the Hex dice, too?

03:56:18.673 --> 03:56:22.507
TRAVIS: No. 30. Total of 30.

03:56:22.507 --> 03:56:24.428
TALIESIN: There we go.

03:56:24.428 --> 03:56:25.621
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:56:25.621 --> 03:56:28.531
MATT: With that, you blow off another one of its
heads.

03:56:28.531 --> 03:56:30.821
SAM: Blow that head!

03:56:30.821 --> 03:56:35.202
MATT: There you go. Now it's down to four heads.

03:56:35.202 --> 03:56:41.159
SAM: Travis loves blowing four heads!

03:56:41.159 --> 03:56:45.349
MATT: Fjord, the stump goes limp, laying on the
ground, but there, out of the corner of your eye,

03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:49.517
you can see another head or two little snouts
beginning to try and regenerate out of that neck

03:56:49.517 --> 03:56:53.206
point. You now are seeing those processes of
regeneration. With each head that is removed, it

03:56:53.206 --> 03:56:56.056
immediately begins to try and regrow in its space.
That finishes your turn, Fjord?

03:56:56.056 --> 03:56:57.064
TRAVIS: It does.

03:56:57.064 --> 03:56:57.433
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

03:56:57.543 --> 03:57:02.232
LIAM: Yes. Caleb leans up to throw some fire at--
Oh, fuck! Fucking-- He pulls out some more

03:57:02.232 --> 03:57:05.231
molasses and just does the same thing again:
Slow.

03:57:05.231 --> 03:57:06.846
SAM: So much molasses.

03:57:06.846 --> 03:57:08.034
LIAM: So 16.

03:57:08.034 --> 03:57:09.667
LIAM: Yeah, Slow again.

03:57:09.667 --> 03:57:10.873
MATT: How many Slow slots do you have?

03:57:10.873 --> 03:57:15.407
LIAM: I only used one 3rd-level and I used it and
got it back with the Arcane Recovery.

03:57:15.986 --> 03:57:19.148
MATT: But you've cast Haste when you got in here
and you cast Slow earlier, so that's two--

03:57:19.148 --> 03:57:21.202
LIAM: That's two, so there's one more.

03:57:21.202 --> 03:57:24.026
MATT: That's right! 6th-level. You get a third
slot! That's correct. I was thinking you had two.

03:57:24.026 --> 03:57:25.161
Yeah, all right.

03:57:25.161 --> 03:57:27.554
LIAM: So Slow. DC 16 with Bane.

03:57:27.554 --> 03:57:37.352
MATT: DC 16 with Bane. For the abomination with
Bane, that's 12 with him. So he fails.

03:57:37.352 --> 03:57:38.396
LIAM: Slow.

03:57:38.396 --> 03:57:41.759
MATT: So he's still Slowed. And the hydra.
(laughs)

03:57:42.596 --> 03:57:44.147
TRAVIS: What?

03:57:44.147 --> 03:57:48.156
MATT: That's fucked up. It was a natural 20.

03:57:48.156 --> 03:57:53.370
LIAM: But I only cast it on the hydra, so the roll
would have been for the hydra because the snake

03:57:53.370 --> 03:57:57.048
guy was still Slowed. So I wouldn't have cast it
on the snake guy.

03:57:57.048 --> 03:58:02.436
MATT: Technically, you lose concentration on the--
When you recast a concentration spell, it drops before--

03:58:02.832 --> 03:58:06.064
LIAM: Could you say that I only give a fuck about
the hydra and that I was aiming at the hydra?

03:58:06.064 --> 03:58:09.578
Because that's a hundred percent true. The hydra is
the big target here.

03:58:09.578 --> 03:58:10.998
MARISHA: What was Matt going to say?

03:58:10.998 --> 03:58:14.014
MATT: I understand, but Slow is an area effect
meaning you can hit multiple enemies. There's no

03:58:14.014 --> 03:58:17.391
reason to not hit him. Otherwise, you lose the
concentration.

03:58:17.391 --> 03:58:18.294
LIAM: Okay.

03:58:18.294 --> 03:58:19.898
MATT: If you want to look at the dice.

03:58:19.898 --> 03:58:22.261
LIAM: No, I don't want to look at the dice. You're
the DM. Whatever you say.

03:58:22.261 --> 03:58:24.089
MATT: I know. That was--

03:58:24.089 --> 03:58:29.247
TALIESIN: If it's a natural 20, then the Bane
doesn't even matter.

03:58:29.247 --> 03:58:33.862
MATT: Right, but then I rolled a four on the Bane,
which brought it down to a 16. Which is exactly

03:58:33.862 --> 03:58:40.003
the DC. That's fucked up. That's why I laughed. I
was like, "That's really stupid."

03:58:40.003 --> 03:58:44.513
TALIESIN: Yeah, the 20 is the only thing you can
roll with a Bane that would definitely have no effect.

03:58:45.295 --> 03:58:48.671
MATT and LIAM: Yeah, that sucks.

03:58:48.671 --> 03:58:55.134
MATT: All right, well, ducked back behind. It
maintains basically where it was before. That

03:58:55.134 --> 03:58:59.219
finishes up your round, Caleb. Yasha, Caduceus,
and Jester.

03:58:59.219 --> 03:59:01.898
SAM: Come on, Jester!

03:59:01.898 --> 03:59:03.975
TALIESIN: We need a fire.

03:59:03.975 --> 03:59:08.612
LAURA: I know, but all I have is radiant flame.
That doesn't quite-- it's not the same.

03:59:08.612 --> 03:59:10.713
SAM: Just light a torch.

03:59:10.713 --> 03:59:13.141
TRAVIS: Is radiant flame the same?

03:59:13.141 --> 03:59:14.793
SAM: We'll find out.

03:59:14.793 --> 03:59:19.433
LIAM: I hate to do this. Can I ask one last
question? You just tell me to shut the fuck up,

03:59:19.433 --> 03:59:23.421
but I really don't care about the snake guy
because he seems weak to me and the spell says I

03:59:23.421 --> 03:59:33.003
can choose the target. So if I only chose the
hydra? I really don't care about that snake guy.

03:59:33.003 --> 03:59:35.624
He seems on his last legs. He seems like a weiner
dog.

03:59:35.624 --> 03:59:38.514
MARISHA: I think you choose it, but it's a radius
effect.

03:59:38.514 --> 03:59:41.926
LIAM: It's not radius! You can pick whoever you
want. So if there were like six guys, I can say,

03:59:41.926 --> 03:59:44.631
"Those two guys," and not get the rest.

03:59:44.631 --> 03:59:46.068
MATT: Okay. Correct.

03:59:46.068 --> 03:59:48.135
MARISHA: It still rolled a natural 20, though.

03:59:48.135 --> 03:59:51.932
LIAM: But if I only aimed at the hydra and didn't
aim at the snake guy, that roll would have gone to

03:59:51.932 --> 03:59:53.851
the hydra. Never mind.

03:59:53.851 --> 03:59:55.736
MATT: To not be a stickler on--

03:59:55.736 --> 03:59:57.143
LIAM: It's too nitpicky.

03:59:57.143 --> 04:00:02.413
MATT: I'm just saying. There was no benefit to not
choosing the snake guy because he would have lost

04:00:02.413 --> 04:00:06.901
his slow if you cast it on just the hydra and
recasting it again, you can choose them both which

04:00:06.901 --> 04:00:10.839
means there was no benefit other than
retroactively doing the die rolls.

04:00:10.839 --> 04:00:15.231
LIAM: I assumed that it would carry over, but
you're right. It drops and you start afresh.

04:00:15.231 --> 04:00:16.101
MATT: Correct.

04:00:16.101 --> 04:00:17.188
LIAM: Good.

04:00:17.188 --> 04:00:18.231
MATT: I'm sorry, man.

04:00:18.231 --> 04:00:19.895
LIAM: I It's okay. Now I understand how it works.

04:00:19.895 --> 04:00:22.304
MARISHA: Sucks when your high level spells fail.

04:00:22.304 --> 04:00:23.645
LAURA: It does.

04:00:23.645 --> 04:00:29.292
MATT: Wizards are high-risk, high-reward for that
reason. That brings us to Yasha, Caduceus, and Jester.

04:00:30.256 --> 04:00:31.796
LAURA: Yasha want to go first?

04:00:31.796 --> 04:00:34.038
TRAVIS: I can if you don't have anything you want
to do.

04:00:34.038 --> 04:00:39.288
TALIESIN: No. I'm going to--

04:00:39.288 --> 04:00:47.366
LAURA: I'm going to-- jeez, you're really hurt,
aren't you, Beau?

04:00:47.366 --> 04:00:53.616
MARISHA: I'm not feeling great, but if you--

04:00:53.616 --> 04:00:59.196
LAURA: It just seems like a waste. I feel like I
should take out at least the other guy to lessen

04:00:59.196 --> 04:01:01.024
to the damage coming in.

04:01:01.024 --> 04:01:02.124
MARISHA: You do you, man.

04:01:02.124 --> 04:01:04.708
TRAVIS: Get that fucking bow and that bow is no
joke. Those arrows are fucking--

04:01:04.708 --> 04:01:09.361
LAURA: What is the wisdom thing that you did?

04:01:09.361 --> 04:01:13.698
MARISHA: He has plus zero to his wisdom saves.

04:01:13.698 --> 04:01:15.211
LAURA: The hydra or the--

04:01:15.211 --> 04:01:17.159
MARISHA and MATT: The hydra.

04:01:17.159 --> 04:01:19.146
SAM: Oh? When did that happen?

04:01:19.146 --> 04:01:22.278
MARISHA: I don't know about the other guy.

04:01:22.278 --> 04:01:24.380
LAURA: I'm going to Sacred Flame the other guy.

04:01:24.380 --> 04:01:28.217
MATT: Okay. Wisdom save on him, natural 18.

04:01:28.217 --> 04:01:30.602
TALIESIN: Oh, no, he doesn't have fucking--

04:01:30.602 --> 04:01:32.205
MATT: Yeah. Plus two, it's 20.

04:01:32.205 --> 04:01:34.942
LAURA: Okay. Oh no, that was a dex save. It
doesn't matter.

04:01:34.942 --> 04:01:37.697
MATT: Oh, a dex save? That's even higher. That's a
21.

04:01:37.697 --> 04:01:38.242
MATT: Sorry.

04:01:38.242 --> 04:01:40.022
MARISHA: Shit!

04:01:40.022 --> 04:01:41.196
SAM: Nice.

04:01:41.196 --> 04:01:45.122
LAURA: I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm
trying to get this guy out. Okay.

04:01:45.122 --> 04:01:46.618
MATT: That finishes Jester's go?

04:01:46.618 --> 04:01:48.466
LAURA: I guess. That's all I can fucking do.

04:01:48.466 --> 04:01:57.746
TALIESIN: I'm going to pop my head up and I think
I'm going to back against the wall so that I can

04:01:57.746 --> 04:02:01.723
actually see what's going on for now because I'm
starting to get nervous. I'm going to use my bonus action--

04:02:02.038 --> 04:02:03.861
MATT: You're putting your back against the wall
here?

04:02:03.861 --> 04:02:08.420
TALIESIN: Yeah. Fuck, man. I'm also going to look
at that undead motherfucker in the corner and--

04:02:08.420 --> 04:02:13.490
MATT: You look at him and he's genuinely scared.

04:02:13.490 --> 04:02:26.520
TALIESIN: Pull your weight. I hate lazy people.
You found one of my buttons. I'm going to do a

04:02:26.520 --> 04:02:33.998
bonus action Healing Word on you. It's not a lot.

04:02:33.998 --> 04:02:36.666
MARISHA: (weakly) I'll take it.

04:02:36.666 --> 04:02:38.600
TALIESIN: Eight points of healing.

04:02:38.600 --> 04:02:41.548
MARISHA: I'll so fucking take it.

04:02:41.548 --> 04:02:46.748
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to use my other-- I can
do this twice. I'm going to use Path to the Grave

04:02:46.748 --> 04:02:54.139
again. The hydra has a problem one more time.
Yeah, I'm using Path to the Grave one more time on

04:02:54.139 --> 04:02:55.195
the hydra.

04:02:55.195 --> 04:02:56.870
MATT: How many times have you used it now?

04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:58.969
TALIESIN: Once and this is now my second because
it resets after a short rest.

04:02:58.969 --> 04:03:03.367
MATT: That's right. Because of short rest. Got it.
Okay. That brings us to Yasha.

04:03:03.367 --> 04:03:09.549
TRAVIS: Yes. She will walk up and-- Do I even need
to go reckless to get advantage?

04:03:09.549 --> 04:03:11.490
MATT: You're still flanking with Avantika.

04:03:11.490 --> 04:03:19.222
TRAVIS: Amazing. Okay. That's good. That's 25 to
hit?

04:03:19.222 --> 04:03:21.529
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

04:03:21.529 --> 04:03:31.771
TRAVIS: (counting) 18 points on the first one.

04:03:31.771 --> 04:03:34.143
TALIESIN: Is that including the--

04:03:34.143 --> 04:03:37.494
MATT: That's 18 points doubled. So that becomes
36?

04:03:37.494 --> 04:03:38.768
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:03:38.768 --> 04:03:39.673
LAURA: Tight.

04:03:39.673 --> 04:03:43.219
TALIESIN: Did you also do the thing where the
first hit of every--

04:03:43.219 --> 04:03:45.825
TRAVIS: The first hit on every hit gets the third
d6.

04:03:45.825 --> 04:03:47.676
TALIESIN: Correct. Okay.

04:03:47.676 --> 04:03:51.918
MATT: With that, another one of the heads is
carved off, reducing this--

04:03:51.918 --> 04:03:54.210
LAURA and TALIESIN: We need fire.

04:03:54.210 --> 04:03:58.406
TRAVIS: The second hit is a 22.

04:03:58.406 --> 04:03:59.707
MATT: That hits.

04:03:59.707 --> 04:04:00.686
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:04:00.686 --> 04:04:02.787
MATT: It's hurting real bad.

04:04:02.787 --> 04:04:04.628
TRAVIS: Two, eight.

04:04:04.628 --> 04:04:07.558
SAM: Every time one of these heads comes back,
does it gain hit points?

04:04:07.558 --> 04:04:08.308
TRAVIS: 16.

04:04:08.308 --> 04:04:10.374
TALIESIN: And also attacks.

04:04:10.374 --> 04:04:17.058
MATT: That's rough. That finishes Yasha's go.
Avantika, it's now her turn to go. Three attacks.

04:04:17.058 --> 04:04:24.893
Oof, that's not a good round. A two, a three, and
16 on the dagger. That hits, though. Five points

04:04:24.893 --> 04:04:26.431
of damage for Avantika.

04:04:26.431 --> 04:04:28.083
SAM: Yeah! Avantika!

04:04:28.083 --> 04:04:31.920
TRAVIS: Yeah! Let's get out of this! Shared
survival!

04:04:31.920 --> 04:04:40.475
MATT: Jamedi is just going to stare back at you
and be like, "I was not hired for this!" That

04:04:40.475 --> 04:04:42.081
brings us to the hydra's turn.

04:04:42.081 --> 04:04:44.507
TRAVIS: You want to reply to that, do you?

04:04:44.507 --> 04:04:48.089
TALIESIN: I'm curious if I buy his bullshit or
not.

04:04:48.089 --> 04:04:49.939
MATT: Sure. Make an insight check.

04:04:49.939 --> 04:04:54.311
TALIESIN: All right, thank you. Ugh, ten.

04:04:54.311 --> 04:05:03.958
MATT: Hard to read. The hydra, now that it has,
technically, advantage with the abomination across

04:05:03.958 --> 04:05:06.369
from you, Beau, it's going to take its attack--

04:05:06.369 --> 04:05:08.019
MARISHA: Oh, does it?

04:05:08.067 --> 04:05:10.301
MATT: Because they have you flanked.

04:05:10.301 --> 04:05:12.154
MATT: That means it's a straight attack for you.

04:05:12.154 --> 04:05:13.339
TRAVIS: I'll do the sentry on it.

04:05:13.339 --> 04:05:14.904
MARISHA: Cool, cool, cool.

04:05:15.501 --> 04:05:19.009
MATT: That is 20 to hit.

04:05:19.009 --> 04:05:20.641
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

04:05:20.641 --> 04:05:21.976
MATT: All right.

04:05:21.976 --> 04:05:23.657
TALIESIN: Oh, with negative d4.

04:05:23.657 --> 04:05:29.423
MATT: Right. That would make it 18.

04:05:29.423 --> 04:05:30.912
MARISHA: (strained) Miss!

04:05:30.912 --> 04:05:33.186
MATT: There you go.

04:05:33.186 --> 04:05:35.380
SAM: 18 misses you?

04:05:35.380 --> 04:05:36.627
TALIESIN: Yeah, she's hard to hit.

04:05:36.627 --> 04:05:38.480
SAM: Right, because you're Hasted.

04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:42.782
MARISHA: No, I got bracers and I'm just fast as fuck.

04:05:42.782 --> 04:05:44.227
SAM: That's <i>crazy</i>.

04:05:44.227 --> 04:05:46.558
MATT: That is 21 brought to 20.

04:05:46.558 --> 04:05:48.206
MARISHA: Yeah, that one hits.

04:05:48.206 --> 04:05:50.946
TRAVIS: 19 against the hydra--

04:05:50.946 --> 04:05:52.840
MATT: That hits. Roll damage for Yasha.

04:05:52.840 --> 04:05:54.482
TRAVIS: That was 12 points of damage.

04:05:54.482 --> 04:05:56.465
MATT: Ooh! That is 14 points of piercing damage.

04:05:56.465 --> 04:05:58.277
MARISHA: To me? Yeah? Okay.

04:05:58.277 --> 04:05:59.642
LIAM: Beau's low.

04:05:59.642 --> 04:06:02.627
MATT: That is 21.

04:06:02.627 --> 04:06:04.244
TALIESIN: Even with the Bane?

04:06:04.244 --> 04:06:08.431
MATT: With the Bane brought it down to 21. I rolled a three.
It was a 24. He's rolling really good this round.

04:06:08.431 --> 04:06:09.126
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:06:09.126 --> 04:06:13.652
MATT: That is 14 points of piercing damage.

04:06:13.652 --> 04:06:16.577
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Beau's down.

04:06:16.577 --> 04:06:17.988
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

04:06:17.988 --> 04:06:19.698
TRAVIS: It was 12 against the hydra--

04:06:19.698 --> 04:06:22.745
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm out of healing.

04:06:22.745 --> 04:06:25.646
MARISHA: Unconscious!

04:06:25.646 --> 04:06:29.717
MATT: That finishes the hydra's turn. The hydra now
regrows.

04:06:29.717 --> 04:06:32.575
LIAM: Oh, and she's all by herself over there.

04:06:32.575 --> 04:06:34.962
MARISHA: Who me?

04:06:34.962 --> 04:06:36.443
SAM: Where are you, Beau?

04:06:36.443 --> 04:06:40.227
LIAM: You're with Jester's clone, but
you're between them.

04:06:40.227 --> 04:06:44.398
MATT: Come here, buddy.

04:06:44.398 --> 04:06:45.637
MARISHA: Fuck.

04:06:45.637 --> 04:06:51.392
TRAVIS: I don't have any fire in the
bag of holding, either.

04:06:51.392 --> 04:06:59.484
MATT: It is back up to five heads now.
It's looking really rough, though. With Beau down,

04:06:59.484 --> 04:07:08.325
it's going to slither up over here and
get into melee with you, Caduceus.

04:07:08.325 --> 04:07:09.803
SAM: Oh shit.

04:07:09.803 --> 04:07:13.355
TRAVIS: No attack of opportunity because of sentry, right?

04:07:13.355 --> 04:07:15.999
MATT: Because you already used your reaction to do so.
In which case, actually, it's going to slither

04:07:15.999 --> 04:07:21.955
even further up into getting with melee with
Jester as well. Now the heads are curling down

04:07:21.955 --> 04:07:27.445
inside and it's making its way to up into the
hallway. That ends the hydra's turn. Beau, I need

04:07:27.445 --> 04:07:30.020
you to roll a death saving throw, please.

04:07:30.020 --> 04:07:31.456
SAM: Oh god.

04:07:31.456 --> 04:07:35.541
MARISHA: Lucky jade. Failure.

04:07:35.541 --> 04:07:39.304
MATT: First failed death save. Nott, you're up.

04:07:39.304 --> 04:07:41.757
SAM: Do I see the keg?

04:07:41.757 --> 04:07:45.673
MATT: It's in the water currently. Right there.

04:07:45.683 --> 04:07:52.143
(music)

04:07:52.153 --> 04:07:55.463
LAURA: Shoot up-- kill the monster guy.

04:07:55.463 --> 04:07:56.399
SAM: Why?

04:07:56.399 --> 04:08:00.669
LAURA: Because he can kill Beau-- he can do double
damage right now to her if he hits her.

04:08:00.669 --> 04:08:02.838
SAM: Yeah, but this guy is up there
fucking your shit--

04:08:02.838 --> 04:08:04.213
LAURA: Do it. Kill the guy.

04:08:04.213 --> 04:08:05.035
SAM: He's not in--

04:08:05.035 --> 04:08:07.890
LAURA: Yes, he is. He's right next to Beau.
He can kill her. <i>Kill her</i> kill her.

04:08:07.890 --> 04:08:09.752
TRAVIS: Kill her kill her?

04:08:09.752 --> 04:08:11.950
LAURA: (cooing) Kill him!

04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:16.094
TALIESIN: We're within talking
range. You don't have to yell at--

04:08:16.094 --> 04:08:17.845
MARISHA: Listen to Jester!

04:08:17.845 --> 04:08:22.783
SAM: I will peek around and fire at that guy,
whatever that guy is. The abomination.

04:08:22.783 --> 04:08:25.304
MATT: Okay. You scoot around the corner.

04:08:25.304 --> 04:08:27.031
SAM: That's a 19.

04:08:27.031 --> 04:08:28.339
MATT: 19 hits.

04:08:28.339 --> 04:08:32.210
SAM: That's--

04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:33.268
LAURA: A lot.

04:08:33.268 --> 04:08:35.048
MARISHA: Save me.

04:08:35.048 --> 04:08:37.354
SAM: 20 points of damage.

04:08:37.354 --> 04:08:52.620
MATT: He's so close. He's still slowed
and you watch him (groaning).

04:08:52.620 --> 04:08:58.824
SAM: I'll run up to that keg. Bend down.
Then shoot one more shot.

04:08:58.824 --> 04:09:01.487
MATT: All right, you grab the keg.

04:09:01.487 --> 04:09:04.947
SAM: 24?

04:09:04.947 --> 04:09:06.368
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

04:09:06.368 --> 04:09:08.412
TALIESIN: Oh thank god.

04:09:08.412 --> 04:09:09.937
MARISHA: Come on.

04:09:09.937 --> 04:09:11.136
SAM: Ten.

04:09:11.136 --> 04:09:15.673
(cheering)

04:09:15.673 --> 04:09:17.382
MARISHA: I live another day!

04:09:17.382 --> 04:09:22.824
MATT: Just right through the temple.
Onto the ground. You're just holding the keg there.

04:09:22.824 --> 04:09:26.457
SAM: I'm standing on the water holding my keg.

04:09:26.457 --> 04:09:31.330
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Nott. That
would have been the abomination's turn, but he's

04:09:31.609 --> 04:09:33.672
dead. That brings us to Fjord.

04:09:33.672 --> 04:09:35.125
LIAM: Wow!

04:09:35.125 --> 04:09:40.891
TRAVIS: Okay. Yes, I'll move just so I have
a line of sight with the hydra and I'll rip off

04:09:40.891 --> 04:09:47.030
two Eldritch Blasts in its direction. That is 18
on the first one to hit.

04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:48.088
MATT: That hits.

04:09:48.088 --> 04:09:49.368
TRAVIS: The second one is 14.

04:09:49.368 --> 04:09:50.081
MATT: That does not hit.

04:09:50.081 --> 04:09:58.295
TRAVIS: Does not hit. Okay. 1d10
plus four. Nine, plus four is 13, plus-- 16 plus

04:09:58.295 --> 04:10:03.274
1d6 for Hex. That's six points. 22 points of
Eldritch Blast damage.

04:10:03.274 --> 04:10:05.450
MATT: You undo its healing from last round.

04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:06.109
TRAVIS: I do?

04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:13.175
MATT: Meaning it healed up 20 points and then you
just did 22. You blast its body and part of its

04:10:13.175 --> 04:10:18.296
back muscles are exposed and bits of bone are
showing. It still has all of these heads that are

04:10:18.296 --> 04:10:22.622
sinking forward and desperately biting around it,
but it's looking really rough. That finishes your

04:10:22.622 --> 04:10:24.365
turn, Fjord. Caleb, you're up.

04:10:24.365 --> 04:10:28.709
LIAM: Oh jeez, okay. I'm not within range of it,
right? Because there's a tunnel here?

04:10:28.709 --> 04:10:30.791
MATT: Correct, you were just out of its range.

04:10:30.791 --> 04:10:35.428
LIAM: I killed it, you saw it. I'm backing up as
far as I can go.

04:10:35.428 --> 04:10:40.534
MATT: Well, this curves around so you can get that
close, but you can't see it.

04:10:40.534 --> 04:10:41.824
LIAM: I need to see it.

04:10:41.824 --> 04:10:44.728
MATT: That's where you can see it. Any further and
you're not going to be able to see it.

04:10:44.728 --> 04:10:47.839
LIAM: I'm going to cast Fire Bolt at one of its
heads.

04:10:47.839 --> 04:10:53.740
MATT: Go for it. It has, technically,
three-quarters cover because of most of it's

04:10:53.740 --> 04:10:55.491
covered by the rest of the chamber.

04:10:55.491 --> 04:10:58.772
LIAM: What if I stand next to Jester instead? And
risk my life.

04:10:58.772 --> 04:11:00.235
MATT: That's half cover.

04:11:00.235 --> 04:11:01.695
LIAM: Half cover?

04:11:01.695 --> 04:11:05.299
MATT: Yeah. Next to Jester there will get you into
its melee zone.

04:11:05.299 --> 04:11:07.400
LIAM: That's fine, that's what I'm doing.

04:11:07.400 --> 04:11:09.212
MATT: It's in the melee zone.

04:11:09.212 --> 04:11:12.500
LIAM: Okay, so that's regular and that is a 21 to
hit.

04:11:12.500 --> 04:11:14.076
MATT: Hold on a second.

04:11:14.076 --> 04:11:15.909
TRAVIS: Are you punching it?

04:11:15.909 --> 04:11:23.274
LIAM: I'm using Fire B-- yes fucking Dragonballing
that shit. Does the hydra have nads?

04:11:23.274 --> 04:11:25.421
MARISHA: Yeah, the hooligan.

04:11:25.421 --> 04:11:32.757
MATT: Just letting you know, you have disadvantage
on attacks when you're in melee with something.

04:11:32.757 --> 04:11:35.224
LIAM: When I'm in melee with something? Well, I
would know that.

04:11:35.224 --> 04:11:35.979
MATT: Correct.

04:11:35.979 --> 04:11:37.261
LIAM: Let's pretend like I knew that.

04:11:37.261 --> 04:11:41.227
MATT: It's either get into melee and have
disadvantage or take three-quarters cover.

04:11:41.227 --> 04:11:43.607
LIAM: So it's disadvantage no matter what. Right?

04:11:43.607 --> 04:11:46.769
MATT: Well it's disadvantage or it gets plus five
to its AC. Your call.

04:11:46.769 --> 04:11:49.220
LIAM: Disadvantage.

04:11:49.220 --> 04:11:51.263
MATT: All right, so you get in there.

04:11:51.263 --> 04:11:52.575
LIAM: So I got to roll again.

04:11:52.575 --> 04:11:53.761
MATT: You can, yes.

04:11:53.761 --> 04:11:58.007
LIAM: The first was 21. The second was much worse!
11.

04:11:58.007 --> 04:12:01.997
MATT: 11 misses. The bolt goes wide, arcing past
it.

04:12:01.997 --> 04:12:04.322
LIAM: Not a good day for Caleb.

04:12:04.322 --> 04:12:14.498
MARISHA: No, you did so much already! So much!
(farts) Sorry. I'd blame it on the chair if it

04:12:14.498 --> 04:12:15.667
wasn't trite.

04:12:15.667 --> 04:12:17.334
LIAM: I'm in range now, right?

04:12:17.334 --> 04:12:19.321
MATT: You are in melee range, yes.

04:12:19.321 --> 04:12:21.150
LIAM: Okay, I'm good.

04:12:21.150 --> 04:12:22.888
MATT: All right, you're staying there.

04:12:22.888 --> 04:12:27.183
LIAM: Yes, I'm staying. If I run, it's going to
hit me, so I'm just going stay put.

04:12:27.183 --> 04:12:30.612
MATT: All right that ends Caleb's turn. Yasha,
Caduceus, and Jester.

04:12:30.612 --> 04:12:36.396
TALIESIN: You want to go first? Actually I'll go
first.

04:12:36.396 --> 04:12:38.075
LAURA: Yeah, go, take it.

04:12:38.075 --> 04:12:42.838
TALIESIN: I apparently have more 3rd-level spells
than I thought, so that's exciting. I'm going to

04:12:42.838 --> 04:12:53.623
cast Spirit Guardians at level three. I just tap
my staff and a bunch of creepy little glowing

04:12:53.623 --> 04:13:02.449
fairies start flying around me. That's a wisdom 16
save. Minus d4.

04:13:02.449 --> 04:13:04.257
MATT: That is a natural 17.

04:13:04.257 --> 04:13:06.086
TALIESIN: Just need a two.

04:13:06.086 --> 04:13:11.456
MATT: A four. Fails. Actually no, technically--

04:13:11.456 --> 04:13:14.866
MARISHA: Oh! Technically, no!

04:13:14.866 --> 04:13:19.569
MATT: In casting Spirit Guardians, which is a
concentration spell, your Bane drops. So it does succeed.

04:13:20.124 --> 04:13:23.608
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, I wouldn't have dropped
the Bane, then. I'm so sorry. I didn't see that it

04:13:23.608 --> 04:13:27.486
was concentration. That would have changed my
plan--

04:13:27.486 --> 04:13:30.019
MATT: Okay, we'll just walk that back a little
bit.

04:13:30.019 --> 04:13:31.100
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

04:13:31.100 --> 04:13:33.389
LIAM: Nobody's allowed to learn at the table.

04:13:33.389 --> 04:13:37.886
MATT: Yeah, Spirit Guardians is a concentration of
ten minutes.

04:13:37.886 --> 04:13:47.504
TALIESIN: That's fine. Did we figure out what the
constitution of this creature was, by the way?

04:13:47.504 --> 04:13:50.857
LAURA: Plus five.

04:13:50.857 --> 04:13:54.616
MARISHA: Plus five to con, plus zero to wis.

04:13:54.616 --> 04:14:01.462
TALIESIN: I'm just going to do what I was going to
do originally which is I'm going to do a level

04:14:01.462 --> 04:14:03.498
three Guiding Bolt.

04:14:03.498 --> 04:14:08.045
MATT: Okay then. You are in its melee, so
disadvantage on the attack roll.

04:14:08.045 --> 04:14:09.534
TALIESIN: That's fine.

04:14:09.534 --> 04:14:11.538
SAM: Guiding Bolt up its ass.

04:14:11.538 --> 04:14:12.952
LAURA: Up the butt!

04:14:12.952 --> 04:14:21.522
TALIESIN: Please. What's the plus to this?

04:14:21.522 --> 04:14:23.088
MATT: Whatever your spell attack modifier is.

04:14:23.088 --> 04:14:24.960
TALIESIN: Where is my spell attack--

04:14:24.960 --> 04:14:26.393
MATT: I think it's plus eight.

04:14:26.393 --> 04:14:28.047
TALIESIN: Fuck! 13.

04:14:28.047 --> 04:14:32.346
MATT: 13 misses, unfortunately. Guiding Bolt goes
wide.

04:14:32.346 --> 04:14:36.240
TALIESIN: Fuck, man. Bonus action, I'm going to
vanish.

04:14:36.240 --> 04:14:46.259
MATT: You turn invisible which means you're still
there-- this is the mark that you're invisible.

04:14:46.259 --> 04:14:48.513
That means any attacks against you have
disadvantage.

04:14:48.513 --> 04:14:50.806
TALIESIN: I'm going to move two spaces over.

04:14:50.806 --> 04:14:52.681
MATT: Two space over--

04:14:52.681 --> 04:14:54.189
TALIESIN: To my right.

04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:55.586
MATT: Here you mean?

04:14:55.586 --> 04:14:57.068
TALIESIN: No, like--

04:14:57.068 --> 04:14:58.812
MATT: Inside the tunnel you mean?

04:14:58.812 --> 04:15:07.903
TALIESIN: Yeah, right in front of Caleb. Just to
get funky. Fuck man.

04:15:07.903 --> 04:15:12.094
MATT: That finishes your turn. Some bad rolls, you
guys, I'm sorry. Jester.

04:15:12.094 --> 04:15:13.669
LIAM: He's focused on us.

04:15:13.669 --> 04:15:18.315
LAURA: I know, he's going to get a hit on us. I'm
going to go down if I heal Beau, so I'm going to

04:15:18.315 --> 04:15:24.568
heal Beau and hope that somebody takes care of him
before he kills us. I'm going to use my duplicate

04:15:24.568 --> 04:15:29.971
to reach down and touch Beau. Can I see my
duplicate?

04:15:29.971 --> 04:15:31.723
MATT: You have to move forward to see it.

04:15:31.723 --> 04:15:33.465
LAURA: Well, I'm already within range of him.

04:15:33.465 --> 04:15:36.017
MATT: You can move there and glance up the side,
if you want.

04:15:36.017 --> 04:15:38.070
LAURA: Can I see?

04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:39.156
MATT: You can see Beau.

04:15:39.156 --> 04:15:41.533
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to reach down and use Cure
Wounds at level one because that's what I've got.

04:15:41.533 --> 04:15:42.970
MATT: Cure Wounds with-- yes.

04:15:42.970 --> 04:15:44.615
LAURA: With touch, yes.

04:15:44.615 --> 04:15:48.036
LIAM: I have this hydra miniature at home and when
I get home, I'm going to go to my office and I'm

04:15:48.036 --> 04:15:49.703
going to throw him into the neighbors yard.

04:15:49.703 --> 04:15:51.954
MATT: I'm sorry.

04:15:51.954 --> 04:15:54.045
TALIESIN: Yasha, please, Yasha.

04:15:54.045 --> 04:15:58.240
SAM: The neighbor finds lots of minis in his
yard.

04:15:58.240 --> 04:16:00.297
LAURA: Ten points of healing.

04:16:00.297 --> 04:16:04.436
LIAM: There's the oni, the giant red dragon.

04:16:04.436 --> 04:16:07.106
TALIESIN: Might as well get right up in there, I
suppose.

04:16:07.106 --> 04:16:09.073
MARISHA: I'm awake.

04:16:09.073 --> 04:16:10.135
SAM: Hi Beau.

04:16:10.135 --> 04:16:14.754
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm an idiot. I'm such an idiot.
I've got to get better at this.

04:16:14.754 --> 04:16:16.868
SAM: Give it a couple years.

04:16:16.868 --> 04:16:18.054
TALIESIN: I know.

04:16:18.054 --> 04:16:20.939
LIAM: Just a few more decades and you'll have
mastered this game.

04:16:20.939 --> 04:16:22.487
MATT: That ends your turn, Jester.

04:16:22.487 --> 04:16:23.983
TALIESIN: I'm seeing things I should have done.

04:16:23.983 --> 04:16:25.161
LAURA: That's all I've got.

04:16:25.161 --> 04:16:26.068
LIAM: That's the game.

04:16:26.068 --> 04:16:26.890
TALIESIN: No bonus?

04:16:26.890 --> 04:16:29.403
LAURA: I don't have anything to do for bonus,
outside of Spiritual Weapon.

04:16:29.403 --> 04:16:31.236
SAM: Do Patient Defense!

04:16:31.236 --> 04:16:32.528
MATT: It's Yasha's turn.

04:16:32.528 --> 04:16:39.341
LAURA: Okay, okay! I've got something. Can I bring
my duplicate up next to me? For my bonus action.

04:16:39.341 --> 04:16:40.205
MATT: Sure.

04:16:40.205 --> 04:16:41.636
SAM: Ooh, confusion technique.

04:16:41.636 --> 04:16:44.706
LAURA: It is, he gets a negative-- he gets
disadvantage on attack rolls against me when my

04:16:44.706 --> 04:16:46.103
duplicate's next to me.

04:16:46.103 --> 04:16:47.557
MATT: There you go.

04:16:47.557 --> 04:16:49.779
SAM: Smart, smart, smart.

04:16:49.779 --> 04:16:56.365
TRAVIS: It's Yasha? She's going to walk up and
swing away.

04:16:56.365 --> 04:16:57.913
LIAM: Save us, Yasha.

04:16:57.913 --> 04:17:01.010
TRAVIS: Is there any advantage from flanking
anything?

04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:06.282
MATT: At the moment, no, because nobody is
directly into melee with it, they're just within

04:17:06.282 --> 04:17:07.352
its reach.

04:17:07.352 --> 04:17:08.642
TALIESIN: I'm an idiot.

04:17:08.642 --> 04:17:13.215
TRAVIS: 25 to hit on the first one.

04:17:13.215 --> 04:17:14.557
MATT: That hits.

04:17:14.557 --> 04:17:20.814
LAURA: That's a lie. I get on advantage on
attacks, they don't have disadvantage on me.

04:17:20.814 --> 04:17:22.029
MATT: Well, there you go.

04:17:22.029 --> 04:17:23.384
TRAVIS: 15 on the second, does that hit?

04:17:23.384 --> 04:17:24.320
MATT: 15 just hits.

04:17:24.320 --> 04:17:43.271
TRAVIS: 20 and there's nothing else. Yeah, 20
points on the first one.

04:17:43.271 --> 04:17:45.119
MATT: Okay, and the next attack?

04:17:45.119 --> 04:17:54.846
TRAVIS: Nine points on the second-- I'm sorry,
ten. Ten points on the second one.

04:17:54.846 --> 04:17:57.338
MATT: How does Yasha want to do this?

04:17:57.338 --> 04:18:01.770
MARISHA: Wait, isn't that her second how do you
want to do this tonight?

04:18:01.770 --> 04:18:03.408
SAM: She's so brutal!

04:18:03.408 --> 04:18:05.937
LIAM: She's so strategic.

04:18:05.937 --> 04:18:16.244
TRAVIS: Jester, Caduceus, Caleb are all cowering
in the hallway with all the hydra heads coming in.

04:18:16.244 --> 04:18:23.706
As it rears back to strike, they see the
Magician's Judge pierce through the belly of the

04:18:23.706 --> 04:18:26.816
hydra and cleave through the middle of it.

04:18:26.816 --> 04:18:32.811
MATT: The blade <i>shinks</i> out the front and then
(squishing noises). With a violent swing, the

04:18:32.811 --> 04:18:37.480
torso splits apart with Yasha standing over the
back and leaping off behind it where it falls and

04:18:37.480 --> 04:18:40.852
slides down the steps to the base of the bottom
chamber,

04:18:40.852 --> 04:18:43.235
TRAVIS: She just goes: No problem.

04:18:43.235 --> 04:18:46.203
MARISHA: That was pretty good.

04:18:46.203 --> 04:18:48.520
LIAM: Fucking Swede.

04:18:48.520 --> 04:19:00.616
MATT: With the hydra slain and fallen, everyone
looks around, taking a moment breathing heavily,

04:19:00.616 --> 04:19:07.166
taking in the much worse way that could have gone
a few times.

04:19:07.166 --> 04:19:14.119
LIAM: One very important question-- Am I still
high as balls?

04:19:14.119 --> 04:19:16.222
MATT: Both Nott and Caleb are.

04:19:16.222 --> 04:19:18.492
TALIESIN: Roll for balls.

04:19:18.492 --> 04:19:20.967
SAM: This is some good shit!

04:19:20.967 --> 04:19:22.982
TALIESIN: That explains a lot.

04:19:22.982 --> 04:19:27.313
MATT: As you step out, you look down and see
Avantika walking up and kicking the body and

04:19:27.313 --> 04:19:32.224
looking at the rest of you. There's sweat in her
brow, little smear of her own blood down the front

04:19:32.224 --> 04:19:41.298
of her face. "Not bad. Not bad at all. You can
stay on the crew."

04:19:41.298 --> 04:19:44.735
MARISHA: Cool. Thanks.

04:19:44.735 --> 04:19:46.362
TALIESIN: That's nice.

04:19:46.362 --> 04:19:50.944
MATT: Puts her blades away. And that's where we're
going to pick up next week.

04:19:50.944 --> 04:19:52.785
TRAVIS: Fucking Jamedi.

04:19:52.785 --> 04:19:54.465
MARISHA: I had questions.

04:19:54.465 --> 04:19:58.365
LIAM: I had some words for Jamedi in the middle of
my drug high.

04:19:58.365 --> 04:20:02.563
LAURA: Holy shit.

04:20:02.563 --> 04:20:05.554
MARISHA: Fuck!

04:20:05.554 --> 04:20:07.082
TRAVIS: Fuck Matt, jesus.

04:20:07.082 --> 04:20:07.837
MATT: What?

04:20:07.837 --> 04:20:12.771
TRAVIS: How many heads did we go through? I think
we went through-- I'm sure CritRoleStats knows.

04:20:12.771 --> 04:20:18.021
MATT: I love the mini; it comes with so many
heads.

04:20:18.021 --> 04:20:24.050
TRAVIS: I think it was around like 14 or 16 or
something, I can't remember.

04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:25.367
MATT: That was fun.

04:20:25.367 --> 04:20:27.288
TRAVIS: That was really good.

04:20:27.288 --> 04:20:28.816
MATT: Well done, guys.

04:20:28.816 --> 04:20:29.990
MARISHA: Oh shit.

04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:31.651
LAURA: Was it?

04:20:31.651 --> 04:20:35.955
MATT: Man, I wanted that to explode so bad!

04:20:35.955 --> 04:20:40.440
TALIESIN: Thank you for not shooting it in the
pool because that might have killed you.

04:20:40.440 --> 04:20:43.184
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know.

04:20:43.184 --> 04:20:45.414
LAURA: I mean, Beau would have definitely died.

04:20:45.414 --> 04:20:47.524
TALIESIN: Beau would have taken an automatic death
saving fail.

04:20:47.524 --> 04:20:49.089
LIAM: But it would have been glorious.

04:20:49.089 --> 04:20:52.614
MATT: If you had thrown it high enough, if you hit
it, it would have just hit the hydra, but that low

04:20:52.614 --> 04:20:56.822
roll was just this low arc. It would have probably
hit Beau and everything around it.

04:20:56.822 --> 04:21:01.398
LIAM: So like, a medium range roll, like a 15,16,
17-- Hit the hydra, killed Beau.

04:21:01.398 --> 04:21:03.136
MARISHA: I would have lived.

04:21:03.136 --> 04:21:10.055
MATT: In essence with the low strength roll, it's
probably best that you missed because it would

04:21:10.055 --> 04:21:10.987
have been--

04:21:10.987 --> 04:21:12.305
SAM: Oh shit!

04:21:12.305 --> 04:21:14.192
MATT: It would have been like a free Fireball,
essentially.

04:21:14.192 --> 04:21:19.298
TRAVIS: What's the ballpark damage-ish? Like blank
d6?

04:21:19.298 --> 04:21:21.150
MATT: I don't know, you still can use it.

04:21:21.150 --> 04:21:22.797
TRAVIS: That's right.

04:21:22.797 --> 04:21:24.223
MATT: You'll figure it out.

04:21:24.223 --> 04:21:26.773
TRAVIS: He said we can still use it if it's not
damaged.

04:21:26.773 --> 04:21:29.247
TALIESIN: Large groups of enemies, it's a great
idea.

04:21:29.247 --> 04:21:30.504
TRAVIS: Fluffernutter.

04:21:30.504 --> 04:21:36.437
MATT: We'll pick up for this next time we play,
which will be in two weeks, technically, because

04:21:36.437 --> 04:21:41.426
we'll be at MCM. However next week, you get to see
Laura's amazing one-shot she's running. Enjoy

04:21:41.426 --> 04:21:48.396
that. We'll pick up this campaign November 1st.
We'll get to see the aftermath of this battle,

04:21:48.396 --> 04:21:58.132
explore this chamber, and what the things you've
learned and hope to learn mean. Until we get to

04:21:58.132 --> 04:22:02.519
then, guys, we love you very much and is it
Thursday yet? Good night.

04:22:02.519 --> 04:22:05.381
ALL: Fluffernutter!

04:22:14.001 --> 04:35:56.199
