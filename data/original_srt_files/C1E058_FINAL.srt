1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,566
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome
to tonight’s episode of Critical Role,

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,558
where a bunch
of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:06,960
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,790
and occasionally
get shivved by a rakshasa.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,318
LAURA AND ASHLEY: No!

6
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,773
MATT: Occasionally.
ASHLEY: Go away.

7
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,273
MATT: So! Before we go ahead
and jump into the game tonight,

8
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:17,893
let’s go ahead and do
a couple quick announcements.

9
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,073
First and foremost,
returning again this week,

10
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:25,777
our sponsor Loot Crate
for bringing this episode to you guys.

11
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:29,534
For those who are familiar with it,
and most of you are at this point,

12
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:31,753
but Loot Crate is
a monthly subscription box service.

13
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:36,311
They have awesome geek-related gear
and merchandise and clothing,

14
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,916
a lot of them exclusive to the box.
You get $20 a month to get 6-8 items

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,226
that include licensed gear, apparel,
collectible, all that fun-ness,

16
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:46,846
but you also get a $3 discount

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,895
if you go ahead and sign up
at lootcrate.com/criticalrole

18
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:54,148
and enter the key phrase
criticalrole - one word -

19
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:57,498
into that new subscription code box.

20
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:02,157
They also have a DX box, which is bigger,
awesome for the super-collector out there.

21
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,476
Which has a bunch
(indistinct music in background)

22
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,115
of really awesome exclusive content.

23
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,951
Plays awesome music
from Ashley’s phone.

24
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:11,749
ASHLEY: That’s true,
you all get my phone if you get it.

25
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:14,597
MATT: This month’s Dystopia boxes
will be shipping out soon

26
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:15,699
to those of you guys who subscribed,

27
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:20,715
and Loot Crate will be announcing
their next box tomorrow, 6/24.

28
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,596
TRAVIS: Yeah, they will!
MATT: So look forward to that -

29
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:23,879
MATT: - and you’ll see what
their next theme is, which will be nice.

30
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,896
LAURA: How - you were already here!
MATT: Sam! Come on in, sir.

31
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,931
MARISHA: You’re here,
you’re still coming in.

32
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:30,756
MATT: You were on time
and you’re still somehow late.

33
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:32,347
SAM: Nobody told me
that the show was starting.

34
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:33,579
MATT: It’s 7:00! It’s crazy.

35
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,034
SAM: Oh, that's right.
LAURA: Oh, that’s how it works.

36
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,862
MATT: So yeah. The links are in the chat.

37
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:41,930
Check it out if you’re interested
in signing up for Loot Crate.

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,807
We hope to make it
a little bit cheaper for you.

39
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:46,742
So, there. We got that.

40
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:50,452
The Critical Role t-shirt design contest
has been live for a while.

41
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:53,619
LAURA: There are so many good pieces.
MARISHA: Oh man, so many good ones.

42
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,386
MATT: It’s going to be ridiculous.

43
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:56,749
I’m not looking forward
to having to choose.

44
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,228
MARISHA: Yes, I know,
it’s going to be tough.

45
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,344
TRAVIS: Stick figures for the win.

46
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:05,303
MATT: But yeah, it closes June 24th, guys.
This Friday at midnight.

47
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,827
So go ahead and get them in;
you got one more day for the most part,

48
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,527
a little over a day
to get those last entries in

49
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,668
and we’ll announce those winners soon.

50
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:16,628
Remember, you have to be 
18 or older to enter,

51
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,297
or you can have a guardian enter -

52
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:22,390
LAURA: We choose the top three, right?
And then the Critters get to -

53
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,632
MATT: The Critters choose the last one.
SAM: But you can already vote.

54
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,822
LAURA: Yeah, I don’t understand
how that’s working,

55
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,447
because we’re choosing the top three,

56
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,781
and then the Critters get to choose
between the ones that we choose.

57
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:35,501
MARISHA: I think it’s supposed to be
like how our Congress is supposed to work,

58
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:38,808
SAM: They’re choosing representatives?

59
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,132
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.
LAURA: I understand.

60
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:44,807
MARISHA: We’ll see what you want -
LAURA: And disregard it completely.

61
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,732
MARISHA: We’ll disregard it completely
and just make our own choice.

62
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,137
MATT: We’re just all not
in the room where it happens.

63
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,977
ALL: (singing) I wanna be
in the room where it happens,

64
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:56,521
the room where it happens,
the room where it happens.

65
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:58,167
MATT: Oh god, we’re those people. Sorry.

66
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,652
Anyway, that ends tomorrow.
You have to be 18 or older to enter,

67
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,021
but you can have a guardian enter
on your behalf if you’re a young artist.

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,854
Fantastic news.

69
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:12,027
Next up, our posters
that we put up last week.

70
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:13,685
ALL: Oh!

71
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:16,736
MATT: Really excited about those,
done by the awesome Joe Mad.

72
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,060
Those are still on sale.

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,294
We have one more week only
for the exclusive cast-signed posters,

74
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:25,166
and then two weeks for the pre-order
for the regular poster.

75
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,518
Go check it out
at the Geek & Sundry shop

76
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,787
if you’re interested.
The artwork is amazing.

77
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,335
TRAVIS: They’re so pretty!
ASHLEY: They're just so pretty!

78
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:35,848
MATT: Pretty sick, movie poster-sized.
TRAVIS: I want it in a frame.

79
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,635
ASHLEY: They’re so pretty in person.

80
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:41,397
LIAM: In person, they look about
ten times more vibrant -

81
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,537
LIAM: - than the images I saw.
SAM: Just like us!

82
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:48,185
MATT: Mostly Sam, though.
You can’t help but be so vibrant.

83
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,447
(funny voice)
I just spilled on my groin.

84
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,383
I don’t know why I felt like
saying that out loud.

85
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,824
So those are the posters.
Check them out at

86
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:58,772
shop.geekandsundry.com/
collections/criticalrole.

87
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:04,783
Starting tomorrow,
we have the MDA stream.

88
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:09,979
Geek & Sundry’s doing
a fantastic 24-hour charity stream.

89
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,863
They’ve partnered with
Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls and Nerdist.

90
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,666
There’s going to be a variety:
game-show, livestream, everything,

91
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,479
benefiting
the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

92
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,002
You guys are welcome
to come in at any time

93
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,033
for as much of it as you can,

94
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,914
check out the great programming
we have set up for you guys.

95
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,118
It starts tomorrow at 7pm.

96
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,654
There will be
no regular programming tomorrow

97
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,680
because the crew is going to have to
be setting up and preparing

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,340
for this actual livestream,

99
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,124
but starting at 7pm,
it goes on for the next 24 hours.

100
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:39,214
So look forward to us all
being sleepless and crazy.

101
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:43,511
We are going to be finishing out
the charity drive Saturday evening,

102
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,169
starting at 5pm PT here.

103
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,474
I’m going to be running a one-shot
Deadlands Savage Worlds game

104
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:53,108
for a few of our cast
who are going to be here for that,

105
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,608
and I’m excited for that
because it’s one of my favorite settings.

106
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:57,297
It’s going to be great!

107
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,689
The shirts are available now
if you want to check them out.

108
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,721
MATT: We have our own -
TALIESIN: Right here. Critical Role.

109
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,798
MATT: - charity shirts right there.
LAURA: Ooh, it’s beautiful!

110
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,354
TALIESIN: Lovely vibrant blue
with a thing on the -

111
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:11,078
LAURA: All of it,
all of it goes to the charity.

112
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,768
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%
of the proceeds go to -

113
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,847
MATT: All the proceeds go to MDA.

114
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,807
ASHLEY: Beautiful “turquaz.”
TALIESIN: “Turquaz.”

115
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:16,974
MATT: We got that set up.

116
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,569
Next up, we have tomorrow,

117
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,713
we have the next issue,
release would we call it,

118
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,093
of Dear Vox Machina.

119
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,889
However, it is not necessarily
a member of Vox Machina.

120
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,047
This is one that I put together
that I think you guys should enjoy.

121
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,265
What character could it possibly be?

122
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,470
I guess you’ll just have
to check in tomorrow to find out.

123
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,211
But that’ll be on geekandsundry.com
tomorrow, I think around noon?

124
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,561
Maybe earlier. I’ll tweet it out.

125
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,849
You’ll find out
on Geek & Sundry’s Twitter page, but -

126
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:46,789
SAM: Is it Jarrett?

127
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,872
MATT: You’ll have to check it out,
you’ll have to come find out,

128
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:50,963
but I had a lot of fun writing it.

129
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,402
ASHLEY: Someone
keeps forgetting to do it.

130
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,613
LAURA: (gasps)
You haven’t done it yet?

131
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,418
ASHLEY: I keep forgetting.
I keep forgetting to do it.

132
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,015
And then it comes around,
and then...

133
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:00,760
MATT: I got you covered.
Trinket had you covered.

134
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,685
MATT: You got five more days.
ASHLEY: All right, guys, we’ll get there.

135
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:09,082
MATT: So yeah, that’s coming up tomorrow.
Check that out.

136
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:13,355
We have a new Signal Boost host.
Marisha, you want to take that?

137
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,024
MARISHA: A new host!
MATT: Yeah, what you got?

138
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:18,373
MARISHA: Stay tuned for the break
to see who it is,

139
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,587
or if you happened to watch it
you already know,

140
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,543
but stay tuned for the break
for the surprise.

141
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,354
SAM: Best kind of surprise.

142
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:30,833
MARISHA: Best kind of surprise.
That you’ve already heard about.

143
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:38,566
MATT: Yeah. And last on my end
as far as announcements go,

144
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:43,336
there will be no Critical Role
official episode next Thursday

145
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,887
because me and Marisha
will be in Australia at the Haven Expo,

146
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,730
so all you Aussies
that want to come see us then,

147
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,060
we’ll be out there
doing panels and talks

148
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,012
and meeting a bunch of you guys.
It’ll be a lot of fun.

149
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,023
However, while we will not be here,

150
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:58,385
there will still be other members
of our fantastic group here

151
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,577
that are able to be here next week
to put on whatever you decide to,

152
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:02,492
that’s up to you guys.

153
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:03,728
LAURA: We’re just going
to hula-hoop for three hours.

154
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:05,196
TRAVIS: It’ll be a surprise.
It’s going to be great.

155
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,106
We're going to draw on each others' faces
with toothpaste.

156
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:09,136
LAURA: They’re going to do other things.

157
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:10,916
I’m going to hula-hoop
for three hours straight.

158
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,098
MATT: Laura’s going to hula-hoop
for three hours straight.

159
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,656
You heard it here. Hold her to it.

160
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:16,023
ASHLEY: She’s really good.

161
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,446
TRAVIS: Yeah, Liam’s going
to hold the plank position for 2 hours.

162
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,620
LIAM: Oh, that’s easy.

163
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,405
TALIESIN: It’s the one
where you lie on your back, right?

164
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:24,643
TRAVIS: Yep. Roll like a turtle.
MATT: Hashtag flat on your back.

165
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,541
TALIESIN: I can do that one.
MATT: The reverse plank? Yeah.

166
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,415
MATT: So yeah, check it out on Twitter
as these yahoos figure out

167
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:33,929
what their content
is going to be next week.

168
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:34,945
I’m sure it’s going to be fantastic.

169
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,427
We’re going to be watching it
from Australia.

170
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,816
I’m excited to see
what you guys pull together.

171
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,917
Anyway. That’s all I got.

172
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,153
Has anyone else got something
they want me to mention?

173
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,478
Or shall we dive on in?

174
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,460
TRAVIS: Let’s get it! Let’s get it!
LAURA: No no no! Keep stalling!

175
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,770
MATT: All righty, then. 
LIAM: Wait wait wait.

176
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,553
LIAM: I would like to say that I was into
breaking my friends’ hearts

177
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,680
before it was cool.

178
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,265
(all laugh)

179
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,892
MATT: Sorry about that.

180
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,865
Without further ado,

181
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:04,286
let’s go ahead and dive into
this week’s episode of Critical Role.

182
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:07,866
(spooky ethereal music)

183
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:11,942
(heavy breathing)

184
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,226
(roaring)

185
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:27,902
(dramatic music)

186
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:31,273
(gun firing)

187
00:08:31,273 --> 00:09:26,948
(dramatic music)

188
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:34,143
(crackling flames)

189
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,127
MATT: Welcome back!

190
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:42,247
So. Last we left off, Vox Machina,
having returned to Vasselheim,

191
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,047
in which Vax
and to a lesser extent Percy

192
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,681
had their own encounters
with the Raven Queen.

193
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:51,709
Vax found seemingly
some catharsis and purpose

194
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,953
to his currently-deemed champion position
with the Raven Queen.

195
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,059
Percy discovered
he’s been broken all along

196
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,238
and left slightly slapped in the nuts.

197
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,455
But such is the nature of your journey.

198
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,744
But you also crafted
a metal claw hand for an ally.

199
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:12,467
But as you guys finish up
your business in Vasselheim,

200
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,223
you made your way
back to Whitestone.

201
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:19,063
While in Whitestone,
you met up with some old friends,

202
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:25,146
had dinner with Allura, Kima,
the Realmseer, Gilmore.

203
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,600
You guys discussed all the things
that you needed to do in the future,

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,491
some information had been acquired
from some of the Vestiges,

205
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:34,456
as well as the nature 
of some of the dragons of the Conclave

206
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:37,950
and some discussion was had
on the overall purpose

207
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,947
of this recent incursion
of dragon destruction.

208
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,110
After which, you all went to bed.

209
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,509
While resting, midnight,
a visit from Gilmore to Vax's room

210
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:50,073
after some oil prankery

211
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,493
was beset upon each other 
via Grog and Vax.

212
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:58,363
Gilmore gifted a fine silk robe to Vax

213
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:01,167
and requested his presence
to discuss time that has passed.

214
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:03,964
Upon changing into the robe,

215
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,789
you guys made your way
down the hallway, up the stairs

216
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:11,327
to one of the high balconies
of the west tower of Whitestone.

217
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:16,900
Upon which Gilmore turned,
seemingly in some serious displeasure,

218
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,482
and stabbed you with a dagger
you had not seen was there.

219
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,304
As the pain set in, you realized

220
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:26,436
perhaps this is not
the Gilmore you recall,

221
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:30,963
but a shapeshifting,
tiger-like devil entity

222
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:34,635
that you may have pissed off
some time in the past.

223
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,231
LIAM: Is it a sports mascot?
It's a sports mascot.

224
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,811
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: They're grrreat!

225
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,470
MATT: That's not sports.
TRAVIS: Wow.

226
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,483
(all laugh)

227
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:44,813
MATT: Not that I'd know.

228
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:49,029
Anyway, let's go ahead
and jump in this moment.

229
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,468
As the rest of the party
is sleeping soundly,

230
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,287
I would like you, Vax'ildan -

231
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:57,275
SAM: I am not sleeping.
MATT: You're not sleeping?

232
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,136
SAM: Remember, I said
I was staying up to read my book.

233
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,991
MATT: To read your book,
you're right, you are totally right.

234
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,934
Well, I'm going to have you
roll initiative, if you don't mind.

235
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,305
LIAM: I have a lot of interesting ideas

236
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,982
that will go out the window
depending on this roll, possibly.

237
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,680
TRAVIS: We're all watching.

238
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,916
LIAM: I don't like his reaction.
I'm going to use luck.

239
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,940
I have two lucks left,
I'm going to use one of them.

240
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,006
(groans) It was on 18
and went down. No, 16.

241
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,398
MATT: 16. All righty.

242
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:30,945
LIAM: Oh, well.
It was going to be really interesting.

243
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:32,325
MATT: I can only imagine.

244
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:35,093
(all laugh)

245
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,410
TRAVIS: Shit.
MATT: Sorry.

246
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,724
TRAVIS: Thug Life glasses come down,
joint comes up.

247
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:44,442
MATT: I didn't mean
for it to come off that way, it just -

248
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,909
TRAVIS: Bu-bu-bu-bu-blam, gutshot!

249
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:50,300
(all laugh)

250
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,479
SAM: Play ding dong...

251
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:56,025
LIAM: It went 18,
it hung like a half second... 4.

252
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,200
MATT: As the surprise round has faded,

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,599
the Gilmore-like entity draws the blade
out of your abdomen,

254
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,397
snarls towards you,

255
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:10,171
and the round begins
with the initiative on the rakshasa.

256
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:13,466
MARISHA: (groans)
TRAVIS: You got this, you're fine.

257
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:20,272
SAM: Wait, refresh us all.
Is Liam - I'm sorry - is Vax naked?

258
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:23,224
MATT: No, Vax is wearing
a long silk robe -

259
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,526
MATT: - and his boots.
SAM: And what underneath?

260
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,043
MATT: And that's it.
SAM: So, he's naked.

261
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,282
LIAM: I'm wearing my boots,
because it's cold.

262
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:31,455
I wouldn't go walking barefoot.

263
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,572
MATT: Boots are a given.
Everything else left behind.

264
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:37,576
SAM: No armor. No weapons.
LAURA: Remember, he was in his pajamas

265
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:41,884
and Gilmore was like, 
"put this on, I made this for you."

266
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:45,288
LIAM: Why wouldn't any of us
trust Gilmore? Or Matthew?

267
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,600
MATT: I'm just telling a story, yo.
Speaking of stories -

268
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,651
SAM: But wait!
The robe has like a rope tie to tie.

269
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,841
SAM: You can use that for something!
LIAM: Shush!

270
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,418
MATT: You’re reading your book.

271
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:01,966
So as it draws the blade back,
it goes in for a claw towards the face,

272
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,229
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge?

273
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:06,140
MATT: Hold on to see if I hit you first.
LIAM: Oh, okay.

274
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,100
MATT: (chuckles) Because
that is going to be a...

275
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,359
MATT: 13 to hit. Your AC is 15.
LIAM: Misses.

276
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,877
MATT: The claw (whoosh).

277
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:15,805
You duck underneath
as it spins around with the dagger

278
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,466
and hits you from the other side
as you come up from that.

279
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:22,261
MATT: That will be a 19 and does hit you.
LIAM: (funny voice) Uncanny Dodge?

280
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:29,223
MATT: You suffer 5 points
of piercing damage

281
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:32,834
as the dagger just barely (sssh)
cuts across your face.

282
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,344
You can feel the little line of blood
begin to spill down your chin

283
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,123
as you hear the growl
under the breath again,

284
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:43,132
"I will send you to a place
 you'll never return from." (growls)

285
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,532
and is actually going to
stay right there. You're up.

286
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,145
LIAM: Now I can do my crazy-ass shit.
So, out of instinct,

287
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:54,465
the heels click together, the boots go on,
the world slows down as I speed up

288
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:58,841
and in that split second,
in a millisecond, I think,

289
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,786
"he's gone to all this trouble
to get me here,

290
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:03,369
"the door behind me
could very well be locked.

291
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,875
"Also, he knows everything.
He knows about Whitestone.

292
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,100
"If he leaves, he can tell the Conclave

293
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,460
"and if I run, he's gone."

294
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,025
So instead...
he's right in front of me, yeah?

295
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,116
Okay. I would like to grapple him.

296
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:25,119
MATT: Okay. All right.
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

297
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,853
LIAM: Okay.

298
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:37,411
Last luck of the day. 14.

299
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:38,387
MATT: 16

300
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,694
You attempt to grapple

301
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:41,909
and as soon as your arms
reach around the rakshasa,

302
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,704
Hotis breaks away.

303
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:44,843
LIAM: Okay.
That's action number 1.

304
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,918
Action number 2,
I'd like to grapple him.

305
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:50,619
(all laugh)

306
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,531
LIAM: No good.

307
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,351
LAURA: Well, say it, he might roll less.

308
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,376
LIAM: Huh? Say what?

309
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,742
LAURA: Isn't it a roll against a roll?

310
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:57,881
MATT: Yes, it's a roll against a roll.
LIAM: It's a 7.

311
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,916
MATT: 17. Sorry.

312
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,869
LIAM: Okay,
I will cast Lay on Hands on myself.

313
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,571
MATT: That is an action to do so.

314
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,271
LIAM: That's an action?
Okay, then...

315
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,649
I'll stay where I am.

316
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:14,345
MATT: Okay. All right.

317
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:17,626
LIAM: No, sorry! Sorry, sorry (mutters).

318
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:22,008
At the top of my lungs I scream,
not just in my earring

319
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:25,646
but loud enough for every guard
and person in the castle. I scream,

320
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:29,539
"Assassins, western tower
and the courtyard!

321
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:31,446
"Jenga!"

322
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,521
MATT: All right.

323
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:37,811
Can I have all of you guys
roll a perception check?

324
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:41,315
MARISHA: What about
those of us with earrings?

325
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:44,817
LAURA: To wake us up?
SAM: I'm awake.

326
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,601
MATT: You're awake. You hear it.

327
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,030
TRAVIS: 16.

328
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,051
ASHLEY: 17.

329
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:50,960
LAURA: 26.

330
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,939
MARISHA: 16.

331
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:52,835
TALIESIN: 15.

332
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:56,354
MATT: All right.
Many of you jostle awake

333
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,802
at the sound of the shouting
into your ear.

334
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:02,984
You hear a few words come through
in the middle of your consciousness.

335
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:09,647
You hear “tower, west, jenga.”
That's as much as you make out.

336
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:12,343
The first word was enough
to just shake you awake

337
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,328
and you're not quite sure
what that word was,

338
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:18,352
but you hear “west tower, jenga,”
and you get the gist of that.

339
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,820
You, however,
did hear the full phrase.

340
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,325
As you look around you,

341
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:26,325
Percy, Keyleth, and Pike.

342
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,890
SAM: Oh, shit.
MATT: You aren't alone in your room.

343
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,390
TRAVIS: (laughing gasp)

344
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,787
MATT: As climbing through the window,
or in Percy's -

345
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:38,193
SAM: Ninjas!

346
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:40,108
MATT: - had come in
through the hallway, you see -

347
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,898
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Ninjas.

348
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:46,181
MATT: - cloaked individuals,
blades drawn up in the air,

349
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,042
about to come down
onto your asleep forms,

350
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,321
as you suddenly look up
and see the figure there before you -

351
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,828
MARISHA: Motherfucking ninjas!

352
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,273
MATT: - they look surprised
to see you suddenly move.

353
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:58,710
I need all of you guys to roll initiative
to add to this initiative order.

354
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,037
TRAVIS: All 3 or everybody else?
LAURA: Everybody?

355
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,410
MATT: Everybody.

356
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,433
MARISHA: Oh my god.
Ooh! That's not bad.

357
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,617
TRAVIS: Have advantage.
TALIESIN: That'll do.

358
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,719
TRAVIS: 18.

359
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,645
ASHLEY: 8!

360
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,609
TRAVIS, LAURA, AND MATT: (chuckle)

361
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,093
LAURA: (southern drawl) 11.

362
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,368
MARISHA: 17.

363
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,372
TALIESIN: 23.

364
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,400
LAURA: Nice.

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,079
SAM: Is initiative an ability check?

366
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,863
(all laugh)

367
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:32,866
MATT: Yeah.

368
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,837
SAM: Then I will inspire myself
on my initiative roll.

369
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:36,602
MARISHA: Yes!

370
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:38,070
MATT: You just got that ability
at level 14.

371
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,133
SAM: Yes.
MATT: So.

372
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,353
SAM: So I will just say,

373
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,724
"Come on Scanlan.
Wake up! Wake up, man!"

374
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,146
(all laugh)

375
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:46,170
SAM: Oh, it's a 1.

376
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,610
(all laugh)

377
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:52,329
SAM: No, it's a 7. It's a 7.
That brings my initiative to 19.

378
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,696
MATT: 19.

379
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,936
(all laugh)

380
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,737
ASHLEY: "Come on, man!"

381
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,066
MATT: All righty.
Well, as you all wake up,

382
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,676
the initiative round finishes
as the attempted assassins

383
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,920
do get their round
on the three of you guys.

384
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,928
So there is the one
that is up against Keyleth right now

385
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:14,867
is going to make
two short sword attacks on you.

386
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,110
MARISHA: Aw, he beat me?

387
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,232
MATT: Yep. Well this is -
as you guys wake up,

388
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,635
you see them there,
and they're finishing their combat round.

389
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,861
So that's going to be a 19 to hit.

390
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:24,582
MARISHA: Hits.

391
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:25,480
MATT: That hits.

392
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,746
Okay. You take 9 points
of piercing damage

393
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,086
and make a constitution saving throw.

394
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,673
ASHLEY AND LAURA: Oh, god.
TRAVIS: Shit.

395
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:40,056
MARISHA: That can't be good. Okay...

396
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,679
TALIESIN: (wordless noise of approval)
MARISHA: 20, total.

397
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,007
MATT: Okay. You take 12 points
of poison damage.

398
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,012
ASHLEY: With?

399
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,722
MARISHA: On top of I had 9 originally?
MATT: Mm-hm.

400
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,772
MARISHA: Right?
MATT: Yep.

401
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:53,209
MARISHA: Okay. So that's...

402
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,403
MATT: The second strike is going to
be another 19. Rolled 12 again.

403
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,003
You take another 9 points
of piercing damage,

404
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:03,601
and I need you to make
another constitution saving throw.

405
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:07,212
LAURA: This is so much worse
than I thought it was.

406
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:09,195
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

407
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:13,687
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 19, so 24.

408
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,216
MATT: You take another 12 points
of poison damage.

409
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,460
SAM: How many points?

410
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,264
TALIESIN: Wow, that's the good reaction,
apparently.

411
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:24,315
MARISHA: Jesus, fuck.
He just did 42 points of damage.

412
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:27,330
ASHLEY: What?
MARISHA: In one round. Yeah.

413
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,330
TRAVIS: Four-two? Four?!
MARISHA: 42!

414
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,813
MATT: So, the one
that's there before you, Percy,

415
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,794
as you're just sitting up out of your bed.

416
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:39,177
That's going to be an -
oh, that's a natural 17.

417
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,848
24 to hit.

418
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:46,458
TALIESIN: If I have an AC of 24,
Am I fine or no?

419
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,825
I mean an AC of 24 -
never mind, it hits.

420
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:52,158
MATT: It still hits you
and and this is assuming also

421
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:54,930
the fact that that you guys were sleeping
and not in your full armor, either.

422
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,593
TALIESIN: No, no that hits.

423
00:20:57,593 --> 00:20:59,735
No, actually - yeah,
I can't do that, can I? Fuck.

424
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,941
MATT: That's 8 points 
of piercing damage to you.

425
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,300
TALIESIN: (sighing) Yeah...

426
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,778
MATT: I need you to make
a constitution saving throw

427
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:08,939
TALIESIN: All right. Don't be stupid.

428
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:13,519
Oh, stupid.
That's a natural 1, that's what it is.

429
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,716
MATT: You suffer 24 points
of poison damage.

430
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,851
As whereas you manage
to shrug off the effects,

431
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:22,415
Percy, you feel as the short sword
strikes across your flesh

432
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:26,725
the wound that's left open
in the front of your long johns

433
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:29,361
suddenly begins to burn

434
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,740
and feels like it's singeing,
white-hot fire,

435
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,530
like an iron just out of the forge
has been pressed into your chest.

436
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,164
The second strike rolls a natural 2.
It's going to be a 9.

437
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,608
TALIESIN: Nope, that does not hit.

438
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,389
MATT: This time, you actually
duck out of the bed

439
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,553
as it slams down on the wood,
cutting into the side of the bed frame,

440
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:49,015
ending that guy's round.

441
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:52,193
That's going to bring us
to the one that is against you, Pike.

442
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:53,861
ASHLEY: Okay.

443
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:54,613
MATT: So, Pike.

444
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,970
ASHLEY: Yes?

445
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,670
MATT: First strike on you.
That's going to be a 20 to hit.

446
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,249
ASHLEY: (chuckles) Just hits.

447
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:06,409
MATT: Though, not wearing your armor
at this point in time.

448
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,052
LAURA: How do we know
what our AC is?

449
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:09,176
ASHLEY: So what are we, then?

450
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,813
MATT: Your AC would be
just 10 plus your dexterity modifier.

451
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:14,530
ASHLEY: So it's 11, so that hits.

452
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,258
MATT: 11. Yeah. You suffer 5 points
of piercing damage

453
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:19,907
and I need you to make
a constitution saving throw.

454
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,307
ASHLEY: Okay.

455
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:26,979
20?

456
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,003
MATT: All right, yeah.

457
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:29,541
So you take 12 points
of poison damage

458
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:35,010
and that is going to be 10,
so that misses you.

459
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,366
ASHLEY: Great.

460
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:37,372
MATT: Yeah. So you take

461
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:39,699
an additional 12 points
of poison damage from the last strike.

462
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:40,517
ASHLEY: So 5 plus 12?

463
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:41,621
MATT: Correct. 17 total,

464
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:44,656
and the second strike goes to hit you
and you actually reach over,

465
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,035
grab your shield which is sitting
on the table by your bed

466
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:50,280
and just (ping)
knock the blade nearly out of his hand

467
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,791
but deflecting the blow.

468
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,062
That brings us to the top
of the initiative round now.

469
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,428
You guys are all conscious.

470
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:58,125
Some of you are aware
of the danger you're currently in.

471
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,932
Percy you're up first.
What are you doing?

472
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:02,934
TALIESIN: I do keep my small pistol
under my pillow.

473
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:07,448
MATT: Of course you do. (laughs)
Yes, you would, Percy.

474
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:11,254
TALIESIN: I don't have access, in theory,
to the big gun, the sword,

475
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,336
which are under the bed
and that would require a thing,

476
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:14,380
and I also don't have access

477
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,855
to any of the things
I could use to reload it,

478
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:16,908
but I do have four shots.

479
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:19,769
MATT: You do.
TALIESIN: Okay. Where's my room?

480
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,616
MATT: Your room is right here.

481
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:22,756
TALIESIN: I don't have a window, do I?

482
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:25,066
MATT: No, you do not have a window.
Your room is on the inside

483
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,074
TRAVIS: What floor are we on?

484
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,543
MATT: You guys are
on the second major floor of the castle.

485
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:33,950
The west tower, as you know,
is up this way.

486
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,052
The staircase leads up
and then spirals up to the west tower.

487
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,428
SAM: Do we know how far?

488
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:42,680
MATT: You haven't -
you've maybe explored there a few times.

489
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,218
It's between 60 to 70 feet up.

490
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,544
SAM: We've not been there,
we're not familiar with it.

491
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:50,930
MATT: Percy would be
pretty familiar with it.

492
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,695
TALIESIN: Yeah, I would.

493
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:53,506
MATT: You guys may have gone there
here and there.

494
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,702
TALIESIN: You've seen it.
It's not that big a castle, to be honest.

495
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,812
MARISHA: So there are windows
that they came through?

496
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,666
They came in the windows?

497
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,650
MATT: These two came in the windows,

498
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,592
this one you're not sure,
may have come in through other means

499
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:07,681
or through another window.

500
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,355
MARISHA: Who are you pointing at? Percy's?
MATT: The one that's in Percy's room.

501
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,671
MARISHA: But we have windows.
MATT: Right.

502
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,588
MARISHA: That are open to the outside.
MATT: Yes.

503
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:19,225
TALIESIN: Is mine
standing against the door?

504
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,360
MATT: Currently, yes.

505
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,869
TALIESIN: I'm going to try
and shoot him through the door

506
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,495
to see if I can blow him out of my room.

507
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,091
TALIESIN: With trick shot. So.
MATT: Okay.

508
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,521
TALIESIN: Trick shot
to blow him out of the room,

509
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,695
Let's... Let's... Yeah, no,

510
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:33,179
I'm not adding a sharpshooter
for that, fuck that. First shot.

511
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,133
Oh god, I'm nervous.
(high pitched voice) That'll do.

512
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,081
It's 22.

513
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,109
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit. 
They're only wearing studded leather.

514
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,720
TALIESIN: Okay. Good enough.

515
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,181
MATT: And they're caught off guard
at how suddenly everyone,

516
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,954
or at least you,
were suddenly conscious.

517
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,179
He was so quiet,
he was so quiet

518
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,296
and yet you still got there
before he could stab you.

519
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:55,209
TALIESIN: Okay and that's got
an auto push, I think,

520
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,876
or do I have to roll for push?

521
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,724
MATT: I believe -
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw.

522
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:02,821
MATT: Yeah. That is going to be
a 5 plus 0, none. No.

523
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:03,923
So. how much damage is that total?

524
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:06,227
TALIESIN: That does... sorry.
I was not prepared.

525
00:25:06,227 --> 00:25:07,437
I thought I was going to watch a fight.

526
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:09,012
MATT: (chuckles)

527
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,524
TALIESIN: I was really prepared for that.

528
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:13,361
That's 11 points of piercing damage.

529
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:17,085
MATT: All right.
And pushes him how far back?

530
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:20,060
TALIESIN: Once... how many squares?
That's a good question.

531
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,400
That's 10 feet directly away.

532
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,266
MATT: (thwoosh) It pushes him
out through the door.

533
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:30,317
You guys hear this muffled (pshew)
gunshot in the distance

534
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:33,446
and this slamming sound
of a heavy wooden door hitting stone.

535
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:35,969
Percy, as you watch, as (boof)
he's blown through the doorway,

536
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,670
landing into the hallway on his back,

537
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,517
and jumps back to his feet just in time
with his blade still out in front of him.

538
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,871
TALIESIN: I'm going to take
two more shots on him.

539
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:46,807
The next shot is a Sharpshooter shot.

540
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:47,751
MATT: Okay.

541
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,167
TALIESIN: -5 to hit.

542
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,998
Yeah, no that's a 13.

543
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:56,111
MATT: 13. As you aim this time
and fire for a second time (pshew)

544
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,997
he does see it coming
and ducks out of the way

545
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,233
as it just scoots under his hood,

546
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,883
avoiding his head
and leaving a hole in the fabric

547
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:06,183
and then (kssh) taking a chunk
out of the stone in the wall behind him.

548
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:07,640
TALIESIN: Okay, final shot is -

549
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,971
I'm using the head shot
to try and blind him for a round, so...

550
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:11,946
MATT: Okay.

551
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:15,490
TALIESIN: That's no sharpshooter
because that sucked.

552
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,633
That's better! 28 to hit.

553
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,183
MATT: That'll do.
Go ahead and roll damage.

554
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:22,106
TALIESIN: He needs to roll
a constitution saving throw.

555
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,084
MATT: He rolls a 20 total.

556
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:30,654
TALIESIN: And that's against -
I just rolled so terribly...

557
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:34,873
20. It's a 19 DC,

558
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,300
so unless that changes
with my new intelligence?

559
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,749
MATT: Yeah so it doesn't -
it isn't affected by -

560
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:39,985
TALIESIN: He just takes 7 points of damage

561
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:41,806
MATT: It was sharpshooter, wasn't it?
It's a +10?

562
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:42,604
TALIESIN: What?

563
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:46,831
No, that wasn't sharpshooter.
I just did the middle one sharpshooter.

564
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:48,638
MATT: Gotcha. Okay.
7 points piercing damage on that.

565
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:52,218
(pshew) While the first hit
managed to miss his face,

566
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,023
this one does (whoosh)
scrape across his chin

567
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:55,934
and cracks a bit of his cheekbone,

568
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:59,545
but not too much of an impact on him
to actually affect his eyesight.

569
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:00,601
TALIESIN: I'm going to use
my movement and bonus

570
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:04,177
to grab at least some of the stuff
that's under my bed.

571
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:07,956
Some of my things
and start to put myself together

572
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:12,334
and steady myself
and I’ll start yelling bloody murder.

573
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:16,048
MATT: Okay. You guys, at this point,
start hearing the distant echo

574
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,615
of Percy's voice
screaming in the distance.

575
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:20,247
TALIESIN: Intruders! Intruders!

576
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,787
MATT: At the end of Percy's turn,
that now brings us back

577
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:25,286
to the rakshasa,
which is narrowed down.

578
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:31,867
Takes the dagger and as a bonus
dips it back into the sheath,

579
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,266
pulling it out
with the liquid trailing off of it.

580
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,876
It's going to go in
and attempt to claw and strike.

581
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,953
ASHLEY: No...

582
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:44,124
MATT: That's going to be
a 23 with the claw.

583
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:47,211
LIAM: Yep.

584
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:50,228
MATT: You take 10 points
of slashing damage.

585
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:55,422
LIAM: Where did my thing go?
LAURA: Here take it, I'm sorry.

586
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,189
LIAM: Okay.

587
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:59,368
MATT: And then the dagger

588
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:03,658
is also going to be thrust back at you
as it moves this way,

589
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:05,898
getting between you and the door.

590
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:09,861
That strike is going to be a 21 to hit.

591
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:10,703
LIAM: Yeah.

592
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:12,250
MATT: All right.
This time with the dagger.

593
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,209
That's going to be 4 plus...
that's going to be...

594
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:20,927
LIAM: Uncanny Dodge on it.

595
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:22,244
MATT: 7 points of piercing damage

596
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:25,634
and then I need you to make
a constitution saving throw.

597
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:30,212
LIAM: 20, natural 20.
LAURA: (happy grunting noise)

598
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,953
EVERYONE BUT MATT AND LIAM:
(groans in relief)

599
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,167
LIAM: There was some damage, though.
It was what?

600
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:45,612
MATT: An additional 7 points
of poison damage.

601
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:49,575
You used Uncanny Dodge on this.
That all gets reduced to just 7 total.

602
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:50,831
LIAM: I did use Uncanny Dodge.

603
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:53,747
MATT: So it would've been 14 total.
You take it down to 7.

604
00:28:53,747 --> 00:28:55,013
LIAM: I lost track of what was what.

605
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:57,651
MATT: Sorry. 7 points of piercing
and 7 points of poison

606
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:00,257
together would be 14.
Your Uncanny Dodge brings it down to 7.

607
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,201
So you just take 7 points of damage
that round.

608
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:04,741
LIAM: Okay.

609
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:14,816
MATT: All right.
That will end Hotis's turn.

610
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,020
That brings us to Scanlan.

611
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:21,143
SAM: Okay. I'll use, I guess,
some movement

612
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:26,042
to gather my belongings
and anything that I don't still have on.

613
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,125
MATT: I mean, everything that you have
would also include your armor,

614
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,571
which you can't really put on right now.

615
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,063
It would take you
about a minute to put it on,

616
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,192
as it is leather armor,

617
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:34,956
but you can grab everything else
if you wanted to.

618
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,766
Or you could carry your armor
awkwardly with you.

619
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:39,172
SAM: I'll just grab
a couple of instruments.

620
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,684
MATT: Okay. (grabbing sound)
You gather some things.

621
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:45,892
SAM: And go. I'll grab
the shawm and the Mythcarver.

622
00:29:45,892 --> 00:29:47,864
MATT: Okay. (grabbing noises)

623
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:50,149
SAM: And if I've ever been up there,

624
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,578
I'm going to try to Dimension Door
to the west tower.

625
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:55,784
MATT: Okay. All righty.

626
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:57,583
SAM: I don't know
if I'm familiar enough with it,

627
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,473
but I'll give it a shot.

628
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:02,648
MATT: All right.
You would've walked

629
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,621
through the castle
at some point in the past.

630
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,888
You grab your things.

631
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:09,743
ASHLEY: I've been there with you.

632
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:12,099
SAM: What did we do up there?
TRAVIS: Made out.

633
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:15,405
ASHLEY: Like just so much stuff there,
so we've totally been there.

634
00:30:15,405 --> 00:30:17,083
TRAVIS: Under the moonlight.

635
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,576
SAM: Did you have hickies afterward,
or something?

636
00:30:19,576 --> 00:30:21,423
SAM AND TRAVIS: (laugh)

637
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:22,807
SAM: Oh, it worked!

638
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:25,553
MATT: At the distance it is at that point

639
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:27,124
and plus the fact
that you have been there before,

640
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,191
you concentrate,

641
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:30,097
you remember a few nights
you walked up there

642
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,475
to look over the grounds
because it's a beautiful view

643
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,184
and it's close to where you guys
usually stay here in the castle.

644
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:34,817
(zoopf) You come out
of the Dimension Door

645
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:35,878
and looking before you,

646
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,204
you can see Gilmore
holding a dagger out to one side

647
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,645
and Vax bleeding,

648
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,411
holding and clutching
the front of his abdomen,

649
00:30:42,411 --> 00:30:44,082
eyes darting around wildly,

650
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:47,188
trying to think of some sort of plan
for survival.

651
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:49,788
So that's your action,
that's most of your movement...

652
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,806
SAM: That's - I mean,
that's pretty much all I've got.

653
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,934
I imagine
I would be pretty confused, so -

654
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,748
MATT: Yeah, you're taking
in the circumstances.

655
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:59,237
SAM: I will probably just,
if I have any time left, I'll just say,

656
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,289
"What the fuck is going on, Gilmore?"

657
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:02,601
And that's it.

658
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:05,622
MATT: The Gilmore looks over his shoulder
and sneers at you. (hissing growl)

659
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:07,156
SAM: Oh, shit.

660
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,066
(all laugh)

661
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,151
MATT: Grog, you're up.

662
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:13,086
TRAVIS: I spring out of my bed
because I don't sleep with any armor on,

663
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:15,169
I got all me bits on me,

664
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,263
and I grab my axe
and I kick the door open!

665
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:18,432
MATT: (boof)

666
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:21,297
TRAVIS: Because I know jenga.
It's one of my favorite words. I'm like,

667
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,513
(wordless aggressive sounds)

668
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,865
Is there anybody in the hallway?

669
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:24,663
MATT: There's nobody in the hallway.

670
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:26,393
LAURA: No no no.
I thought the gunman was in the hallway?

671
00:31:26,393 --> 00:31:28,587
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: Percy's gunman was in the hallway.

672
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,121
MATT: Grog is sleeping
in this side of the hallway.

673
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,243
LAURA: Oh, shit!
TALIESIN: Oh.

674
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:34,092
TRAVIS: Where are the stairs?
MATT: Around that way.

675
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,629
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!

676
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,465
So I start tearing down the hallway
as far as me little legs can carry me.

677
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,381
MATT: About there
if you want to take a dash.

678
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,595
TRAVIS: I'll dash.

679
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:49,754
MATT: That's your movement
and your dash, your action.

680
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:54,747
You get to there as you come around

681
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,609
and see a guy in full black cloak
and some bullets (tssh) flying by,

682
00:31:58,609 --> 00:31:59,735
shattering the stonework behind.

683
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,716
And then you see this humanoid character

684
00:32:01,716 --> 00:32:04,413
holding a short sword at his side,
growling.

685
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:08,442
He sees you looming down the hallway
and his eyes go wide for a moment,

686
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:11,902
unexpected to see this giant train
of a muscled entity charging down.

687
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:13,574
TRAVIS: And the dash
was my bonus action right?

688
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:14,762
MATT: No, the dash is your action.

689
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:16,015
TRAVIS: So I have a bonus?

690
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:17,006
MATT: You have a bonus, yes.

691
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:17,763
TRAVIS: Can I look down and say,

692
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,457
"Hello, muppet."

693
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,780
And I would like to rage.

694
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,618
(all laugh)

695
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:25,499
MATT: All righty.

696
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:26,831
LIAM: Golf clap.
LAURA: Golf clap.

697
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:29,271
MARISHA: Good play, good play.

698
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:30,875
TRAVIS: Polite as fuck.
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

699
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,097
MARISHA: Okay.
So this guy is by the door, yeah?

700
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:34,954
Or by the window?

701
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,071
MATT: Mm-hm.

702
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,153
MARISHA: How far away from the window?
Like, is his back up against the window?

703
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:42,323
MATT: Like - like basically just
stepped out of the window

704
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:45,982
and you were immediately next to it,
so the window is right to his left

705
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,910
as he's staring down at you
with a blade in the air.

706
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,157
MARISHA: It's an open window.
MATT: Yes.

707
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,642
MARISHA: Bars on it or something?
LAURA: He came in.

708
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:55,972
MATT: It looks like the window

709
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,394
is easy enough
for somebody to slip through.

710
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,976
It's an open window.

711
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,527
MARISHA: Okay.

712
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,099
TALIESIN: It's a nice neighborhood.
There's no bars on the windows.

713
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:07,428
MARISHA: I'm trying to think
which way I want to go with this.

714
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,424
MATT: Make it quick.

715
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:15,194
MARISHA: I'm going to towards him
do a Thunderwave push (boof)

716
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,660
and try and push him out the window.
Thunderwave.

717
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,088
MATT: So you're going
to move around him first?

718
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,696
MARISHA: Oh, does he have me
up against the window?

719
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,586
MATT: You're up against the wall.
If you want to Thunderwave him,

720
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,103
you'd have to get
on the other side of him

721
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,219
to knock him away from you.

722
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,161
MARISHA: And he'll get
an attack of opportunity, I'm assuming?

723
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:31,810
MATT: No, because you
don't leave his combat.

724
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,566
MARISHA: Oh. Okay, yeah,
I'll just shoulder around him.

725
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:37,861
MATT: You dart off the edge of the bed,
catching yourself on the ground,

726
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:39,872
turn around the other side and (boof).

727
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:41,705
What's the DC on that?

728
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,462
MARISHA: Jesus, I don't know.
I don't do this very often.

729
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:49,275
MATT: (singsong) DC of Thunderwave.
Vax, you're up next, prepare.

730
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:52,599
MARISHA: It is
a constitution saving throw.

731
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,039
MATT: And what's your spell DC?

732
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,085
MARISHA: 19.

733
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:58,733
MATT: That is a 9 + 2, 11.
That's not enough.

734
00:33:58,733 --> 00:33:59,642
How much damage does he take?

735
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:03,258
MARISHA: He takes 2d8 damage
and he is pushed 10 feet.

736
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:04,513
MATT: All righty.

737
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:08,221
MARISHA: Hopefully out the window
because that's what I was going for.

738
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:10,354
TALIESIN: It's a small room.

739
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:15,030
MARISHA: That was cocked. 4 damage.

740
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,434
MATT: 4 points of thunder damage.

741
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,238
However, (boomf) it slams him back.

742
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:22,137
His feet hit the edge
of the the lip of the window.

743
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:23,885
He goes flipping backwards
out the side.

744
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,030
He's going to attempt
to reach out and grab it.

745
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,961
TRAVIS: Please fail.

746
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:27,264
MATT: That is a natural 2.

747
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:29,074
(all cheer)

748
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:31,388
MATT: (thwoop) You hear, 
"Nooo!"

749
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:32,601
ASHLEY: Yes!

750
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:33,478
MATT: As he's flung out the window.

751
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:35,121
You don't even hear the landing,
he's just out of the room now.

752
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:36,817
TALIESIN: Full on Wilhelm scream.

753
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:39,016
TRAVIS: Nice. Nice job.
TALIESIN: (imitates Wilhelm scream)

754
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:43,087
LIAM: How about a Howard Dean?
MARISHA: And then I'm going to take just -

755
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:46,451
MATT: You have a few more...
15 more feet you can run, if you want to.

756
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,729
MARISHA: Okay.
I'm going to throw open the door

757
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:52,393
and just peek out the door
and see what's up.

758
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,145
MATT: Okay, you throw the door open.
Immediately out,

759
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:58,069
you see Grog standing in the hallway
clutching the axe,

760
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:01,656
kind of sleepy-eyed, but filled
with hatred and intent to kill,

761
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:04,119
while grinning
in the center of the hallway.

762
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,023
MARISHA: And then I’m going
to come over my comm and just say,

763
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,251
"Status report, where is everybody?"

764
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,979
And that’s it.

765
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:11,719
MATT: Okay, after Keyleth's turn,
that brings us to Vax.

766
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,028
LIAM: I can’t see
through the corner of the wall there.

767
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,411
Is Scanlan like 10 feet away?
5 feet away?

768
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:17,899
MATT: Scanlan is 10 feet from you.

769
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:20,433
LIAM: All right.

770
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:24,677
I’m going to skirt along on his side,
the rakshasa’s side, and shout out,

771
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,932
"It’s not Gilmore,
it’s a fucking demon!"

772
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:28,836
at Scanlan, and then

773
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:33,884
I’m going to use my first action
to try to disarm kitty-cat.

774
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,506
MARISHA: Meow.
MATT: Okay. All right.

775
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,300
LIAM: What is that?
TRAVIS: Disarm him?

776
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:42,700
MATT: Go ahead and make...
go ahead and make an attack roll -

777
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,486
or no, for this one,
let’s make an athletics check to try.

778
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:49,068
It’s essentially a type of grapple.

779
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,573
LIAM: All right.

780
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,221
Uh, 16.

781
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,124
MATT: 16.

782
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,066
Okay, you reach out

783
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:00,776
and manage to grab the Gilmore’s wrist,
holding the dagger.

784
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:04,876
His arm goes up
and starts clawing these fingernails,

785
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,292
these currently
not-even-visible fingernails

786
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,267
that all of a sudden
turn into these large hooks

787
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,132
that start tearing into your skin.

788
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:11,533
Go ahead and make a strength check

789
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,771
to see if you can
wrestle the blade from his grasp.

790
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:16,108
LIAM: And this is the next action?

791
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,605
MATT: This would be the next action, yeah.

792
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:19,739
Since you don’t have
any disarm-based abilities,

793
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,231
this is a more involved -

794
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:23,245
LIAM: 15. That’s still acrobatics, right?

795
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:24,773
MATT: No no no, this -
LIAM: What’d you say?

796
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:25,729
MATT: This is all athletics.

797
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:29,933
LIAM: This is athletics.
Same thing, sorry, yeah. 15.

798
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,345
MATT: Yeah, 15?
LIAM: 15.

799
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:38,081
MATT: You still have the grip on him,
but unfortunately his fingers

800
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,123
are too tight on the blade
and you can’t quite pull it out.

801
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:42,196
LIAM: Okay, then,
for the rest of my turn,

802
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,219
I whip my head to Scanlan, say,

803
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,665
"Follow me down. I’m going down."

804
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,416
And I want to drag him
off the balcony, and go with him.

805
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,797
MATT: Okay,
you can drag him at half-speed -

806
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:53,912
LIAM: Half-speed. I’m hasted.
MATT: Hasted.

807
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:57,341
LIAM: 12 squares, full.
MATT: (fwwsh)

808
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,977
(all shout)

809
00:36:58,977 --> 00:37:02,975
MATT: You watch, Sam,
as he grabs

810
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:09,831
this apparently Gilmore character,
looks at you, tells you this,

811
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:12,477
and then they both just hit the edge

812
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:17,043
and tumble over the side of the balcony 
and go falling off.

813
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:20,140
LIAM: This takes two seconds to go down.
I looked it up. 80 feet is two seconds.

814
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,500
MATT: Yep. (whoosh whoosh boomf)
You hear two impacts.

815
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:33,766
SAM: But I just got here!
Don’t leave!

816
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:37,529
MATT: Both you and Hotis...

817
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:50,404
36 points of damage
as you both (boomf)

818
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:56,256
hit the bottom, this stone surface,
essentially the ceiling

819
00:37:56,256 --> 00:38:01,865
and the beginnings
of the entire castle here on the top,

820
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:06,145
both prone on the ground,
dazed from the impact.

821
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:09,454
LIAM: Really hoping the guards are awake.
LAURA: Really hoping.

822
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:16,356
MATT: All righty. Ending your turn,
that brings us to the assassins. So -

823
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:20,789
ASHLEY: But we didn’t -
LAURA: But we didn’t get to go.

824
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:22,261
LAURA: Do assassins get to go twice?

825
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,069
MATT: No, you guys go after them

826
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,051
because that
was how the initiative order happened.

827
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:25,950
LAURA: (biting noise)

828
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,882
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: That was 3 points of damage.

829
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:32,847
MATT: Him yelling and waking you guys up

830
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,455
avoided them getting an auto-crit
on their first attack.

831
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,901
LAURA: Oh, shit.
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

832
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,790
MATT: So be happy that
at least you woke up for the last round.

833
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,998
LAURA: That’s good, that’s good.
ASHLEY: I’m happy, I’m happy.

834
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:43,013
TALIESIN: Thank you, Matt.
LIAM: So happy! Happy.

835
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,469
MATT: Happy.
TRAVIS: Thanks, Matt.

836
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,297
MATT: So that’s two strikes
against you, Pike,

837
00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:49,629
and then this one here

838
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:51,882
looks over the shoulder
and sees you, Grog,

839
00:38:51,882 --> 00:38:55,345
and is going to start darting this way...

840
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:03,999
and currently is out of sight.

841
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,140
MARISHA: The assassin doucher?
MATT: Yep.

842
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,573
MATT: The one that’s attacking you, Pike -

843
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:12,495
LIAM: I assume what I said to Scanlan
was heard over earring as well.

844
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:17,933
MATT: Most likely, yeah.
That’ll be a 22.

845
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:18,808
ASHLEY: Well, yes.

846
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:21,527
(all laugh)

847
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,090
MATT: You take 7 points
of piercing damage,

848
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,180
and roll
another constitution saving throw.

849
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,942
ASHLEY: 7 points?
MATT: Yep.

850
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:33,628
ASHLEY: Okay. That’s fine. 7 points.

851
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:34,863
MATT: And roll
a constitution saving throw when you can.

852
00:39:34,863 --> 00:39:39,921
The second strike, this time,
you slam his hand with the shield

853
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,115
and you can see
he actually drops the blade

854
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:43,091
and has to rush over to pick it up.

855
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:45,380
ASHLEY: 13?

856
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,934
MATT: 13. You suffer 24 points
of poison damage

857
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:51,320
as the first strike this time

858
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,926
cuts you right across the clavicle
and down to the front of your chest,

859
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:57,053
and it’s just, that sharp burning pain
for a second

860
00:39:57,053 --> 00:40:01,248
and as you knock the other hit away,
all of a sudden you feel the (oomf oomf).

861
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,186
Your ears fill with bright,
burning-hot warmth

862
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:06,917
and all of sudden
the pain from your wound

863
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:10,321
begins to pulse with every heartbeat
as the poison hits your system.

864
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:12,923
ASHLEY: Nice. Okay.

865
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:16,227
MATT: And he’s going to move this way

866
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,935
to start getting between you
and the doorway.

867
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:24,397
That’s going to end their turns.
Vex, you’re up.

868
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:27,749
LAURA: Okay. I’m going to get up,

869
00:40:27,749 --> 00:40:31,629
I’m going to yell at Trinket
to run out the door,

870
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:37,288
and I’m going to grab my arrows
and my quiver and my broom.

871
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:47,456
MATT: Trinket’s going into a full -
we’ll say he can do a full dash.

872
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:49,022
LAURA: Can he get to the guy?

873
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:50,606
MATT: He’s gotten that far
up the hallway.

874
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:51,462
He doesn’t see anybody yet.

875
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:54,390
You grab your stuff. All right.

876
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,545
That’ll be an action to
get all of your things together.

877
00:40:56,545 --> 00:40:58,310
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Your quiver, your arrows…

878
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,230
LAURA: The broom.
MATT: The broom.

879
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,073
LAURA: And I take off running
to the west tower.

880
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:05,966
So we don’t see the guy
outside of Percy’s room?

881
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,195
MATT: Nope.
That’s as far as you get, there.

882
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:12,710
Cool. That ends Vex’s turn.
Pike, you’re up.

883
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,586
ASHLEY: Okay. So, I’m going to
take out my hand,

884
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:19,843
and I’m going to Guiding Bolt him.

885
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,663
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Take out your hand?

886
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:25,782
TRAVIS: I’m going to take out my hand!
ASHLEY: My trusty old hand.

887
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,505
MATT: The wound across your chest
with the pulsing poison,

888
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:33,188
suddenly the area that was once dark
begins to light up

889
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,448
as the holy symbol that forever hangs
around your neck

890
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:38,320
begins to glow
with vibrant divine energy,

891
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,386
this whitish-yellow pulse of light.

892
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:43,284
The assassin, standing there grinning,
seeing that he’s getting the upper hand,

893
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,724
all of a sudden realizes

894
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:46,268
that you aren’t as disarmed
as he thought you were.

895
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,510
Go ahead and roll for the attack on this.

896
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,038
TRAVIS: Smoke him!

897
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,305
ASHLEY: 28.

898
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,840
MATT: That’ll hit.
Go ahead and roll damage on that.

899
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,865
What level were you casting it at?

900
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,008
ASHLEY: I’m going to do it at 4.

901
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:02,334
MATT: Usually you decide that
before you roll the attack, but yeah.

902
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,250
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Puddins, Pike.

903
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,123
ASHLEY: I was going to.
That’s what I was going to do.

904
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,377
MATT: I assumed you were.
That’s fine.

905
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:10,966
ASHLEY: But I didn’t tell you that.
How many do I roll?

906
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:14,984
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

907
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:18,656
MATT: Let me look it up for you.
Guiding Bolt is 4d6 -

908
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:19,934
ASHLEY: 7, right?

909
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:21,556
MATT: - and then it would be
an additional 3d6

910
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,451
for 7d6 radiant damage against him.

911
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:25,466
ASHLEY: Yeah, 7, okay.
Okay, so.

912
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,637
TRAVIS: Yep, 8.
ASHLEY: 8.

913
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:31,372
TRAVIS: 11, 19.

914
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:38,217
TRAVIS: 7, 26.
LAURA: One more.

915
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:40,632
ASHLEY: What was it?
TRAVIS: 27.

916
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:42,307
ASHLEY: 27 points.

917
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:47,608
MATT: 27 points, nice. 
You see his eyes widen

918
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:50,374
as suddenly you blast him in the face
with this Guiding Bolt.

919
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:53,213
The impact just (boof)
bursting across him,

920
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,301
leaving this trail of divine fire

921
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:58,975
that’s burning around the seams
of his leather armor.

922
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,545
He’s trying to pat it out,
but it won’t go out.

923
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,677
While it’s not burning him,

924
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:03,131
it’s lighting him up
like a Christmas tree,

925
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:07,172
and Grog, you see -
from underneath Pike’s door,

926
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:10,010
you see a little bit
of a bright divine glow

927
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,777
flash out from under the door

928
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:15,156
and you hear a couple thumps
against the wood from inside the room.

929
00:43:15,156 --> 00:43:17,294
TRAVIS: And that’s her,
the one to the right of me?

930
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,474
LAURA: Yeah, which ones
are everybody’s rooms?

931
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:23,450
MATT: This is Vex’s room,
Keyleth’s, Pike’s, Percy -

932
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,395
SAM: The one that smells like patchouli
is mine.

933
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:29,828
MATT: Yeah. Scanlan’s and Grog’s
and Vax’s were over here.

934
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:30,918
LAURA: Okay.

935
00:43:30,918 --> 00:43:34,070
ASHLEY: So can I move
out of the room?

936
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,722
MATT: You can try to, yeah.

937
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:42,202
ASHLEY: I grabbed all my stuff
and then I’m going to make my way out.

938
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,485
MATT: Okay, all your stuff would be -

939
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:45,667
You have your shield already
that you pulled off the side.

940
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:49,563
You can grab maybe one weapon and go.
You’re not going to get armor, though.

941
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:51,509
ASHLEY: I’ll grab my mace.
MATT: So you grab your mace, all right.

942
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:53,339
LIAM: You’re in a slip or nothing, so.

943
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,045
ASHLEY: I sleep naked.
TRAVIS: Thatta girl!

944
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:58,058
SAM: So you’re naked
with a shield and a mace.

945
00:43:58,058 --> 00:43:59,689
TRAVIS: That’s a bad bitch.
LAURA: Hell yeah, she is.

946
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:01,153
LIAM: Monster!

947
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:05,851
MATT: Shield, mace, holy symbol -
ASHLEY: Do I have my gauntlets on or no?

948
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,052
MATT: Nothing else.
Yeah, your gauntlets are on.

949
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:08,067
ASHLEY: Okay.

950
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:10,602
MATT: We’ll say the gauntlets were there,
you slip them on real fast.

951
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:13,070
As he’s pulled back
and trying to pat out the flames,

952
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,779
you grab your things and rush through.

953
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:16,293
He does get
an attack of opportunity on you

954
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:18,590
as you run out of his combat range,
so he’s going to swing at you.

955
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,886
MATT: That is going to be a 16.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

956
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:24,797
MATT: That does hit.

957
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:29,258
With your shield, what’s your AC?
It would be 11-13, so yeah, it still hits.

958
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:32,338
So you take 5 points
of piercing damage.

959
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:34,823
I need you to roll
another constitution saving throw.

960
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:37,713
SAM: Man. Pikey.

961
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,334
ASHLEY: That is a 5?

962
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:43,103
MATT: You take another 24
of poison damage.

963
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:44,912
SAM: Oh my gosh, she going to die.
LAURA: Oh, no!

964
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:47,546
ASHLEY: No no no, I don’t think
I’m uncon - wait, 24 points?

965
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,843
ASHLEY: I got one hit point left.

966
00:44:53,843 --> 00:44:56,824
SAM: How did that happen so fast?
LAURA: She took 24 twice!

967
00:44:56,824 --> 00:44:58,321
TRAVIS: Poison sucks.

968
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,576
MATT: Assassins, man.

969
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,775
SAM: What are these assassins?
MARISHA: Bullshit.

970
00:45:01,775 --> 00:45:04,085
LIAM: Heal and run, heal and run,
heal and run.

971
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:06,369
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All righty.

972
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,043
TRAVIS: Does she burst out in the hallway
naked with a mace and a shield?

973
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,915
MATT: Naked with a mace and shield,
glowing holy symbol,

974
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,933
and just gash across her chest,
blood pouring from the wound.

975
00:45:13,933 --> 00:45:15,178
LAURA: Oh, Pike!

976
00:45:15,178 --> 00:45:18,629
MATT: Sweat on her brow,
one eye’s half-closed.

977
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:20,500
MATT: She’s barely standing.
SAM: And weirdly hairy shoulders.

978
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,486
(all laugh)

979
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,681
LIAM: That’s why
I never take the armor off, guys.

980
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,777
MARISHA: No!

981
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:31,600
ASHLEY: And hairy chest.
Just full hairy chest.

982
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,162
MATT: Ending Pike’s turn.
SAM: Oh, god. I never knew.

983
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:34,926
MATT: Percy, you’re up.
LIAM: Still love me, Scanlan?

984
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:39,030
TALIESIN: I’m going to run out of my -
I’m grabbing just the basics.

985
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,858
Gloves and the gunbelt
and my gun stuff. No armor.

986
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:44,854
SAM: Gun stuff.

987
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:48,053
TALIESIN: No amulet.
Running out in the front, what do I -

988
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:49,364
MATT: Amulet, you would probably -

989
00:45:49,364 --> 00:45:51,117
you don’t need to take that off to sleep,
so I’ll let you have that.

990
00:45:51,117 --> 00:45:52,002
TALIESIN: Okay, so fine,
I’ll just have that.

991
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,297
All right, so no armor, so.

992
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:58,721
TALIESIN: Which direction is the west?
MATT: This way.

993
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:02,739
TALIESIN: It’s this way,
and do I see any, I don’t see what -

994
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:04,080
MATT: You don’t see anyone,

995
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,323
you just see Pike burst out
of her room suddenly, bloodied.

996
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:10,674
TALIESIN: Okay, I’m going to
run past her room towards the west,

997
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:12,996
and do I have a view right there?

998
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:15,935
MATT: You now have a view of a guy
beaming with divine light,

999
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:18,263
trying to pat out divine flames
after swinging

1000
00:46:18,263 --> 00:46:22,292
and getting a nice heavy wound on Pike,
who looks like she’s barely standing.

1001
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:25,612
TALIESIN: Okay,
I’m going to take a couple -

1002
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:29,704
LIAM: Fuck him up. Fuck him up.
TRAVIS: If he takes care of you, though...

1003
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,480
TALIESIN: I get one foot, stop,
turn around.

1004
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,623
I draw my sword and I’m just going to
go stabby on the bastard

1005
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,592
because I haven’t reloaded my gun yet.

1006
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:37,676
TRAVIS: That was in Pike’s room?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1007
00:46:37,676 --> 00:46:40,064
TRAVIS: Good, okay.
TALIESIN: I can get there.

1008
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:44,109
MATT: This is the end
of your movement.

1009
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:45,991
TALIESIN: Oh, right there? Okay.

1010
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:49,742
Then fine, I’ll just unload the gun.
That’ll be fun.

1011
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:51,374
MATT: So you have a fourth shot.

1012
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:53,987
TALIESIN: I have a fourth shot
and then another one, yeah.

1013
00:46:53,987 --> 00:46:57,711
MATT: Okay. Regular shot?
TALIESIN: No, sharpshooter.

1014
00:46:57,711 --> 00:46:59,551
MATT: Sharpshooter, okay.

1015
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,327
You have advantage on this shot,
by the way,

1016
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:02,701
because of the Guiding Bolt
that she did to him.

1017
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:03,809
SAM: Ooh!
TALIESIN: Oh, I do?

1018
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,023
MATT: Yeah, because the divine fire
that’s surrounding him

1019
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,150
is lighting him up
like a giant birthday candle.

1020
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,148
TALIESIN: All right, that’ll be 28 to hit.
MATT: That’ll hit.

1021
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:11,958
MATT: Go ahead
and roll damage on that one.

1022
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:16,898
SAM: Hashtag gun stuff.
LIAM: Quentin Tarantino joined.

1023
00:47:16,898 --> 00:47:18,377
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage.
LIAM AND MARISHA: Gun stuff.

1024
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,489
MATT: (gunshot sound)
The Guiding Bolt flares off.

1025
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:25,529
The impact hits him
and sends him on his back foot.

1026
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,011
He looks over and sees
the smoke pouring out of the barrel

1027
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,407
as you’re aiming down for another shot.
You reload real fast.

1028
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:33,625
TALIESIN: Taking another shot at him.
MATT: Go for it.

1029
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:36,622
TALIESIN: Advantage?
MATT: No, that was just the first one.

1030
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:38,553
TALIESIN: That’s okay,
I still rolled really great.

1031
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,860
(all laugh)

1032
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,332
ASHLEY: That’s okay, I still rolled well.

1033
00:47:42,332 --> 00:47:43,834
TALIESIN: I was hoping for a critical,
but whatever.

1034
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:45,973
LAURA: Yeah, I’m not going to need it.
ASHLEY: Fucking nailed it.

1035
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:47,660
MATT: Just wanted to check.

1036
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,029
TALIESIN: 25 to hit.

1037
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:51,908
MATT: The dungeon master
will remember this.

1038
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:54,881
No, it’s fine.
So go ahead and roll damage.

1039
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:55,807
Sharpshooter as well?

1040
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:59,572
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was...

1041
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:01,511
24 points of damage.

1042
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,728
MATT: 24 points of damage...

1043
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,000
(gunshot) The second shot.
You reload, fire again.

1044
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,181
This time this one hits him

1045
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,337
right square in what looks like
the side of his jaw,

1046
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:18,492
shattered his cheekbone and his jaw

1047
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:20,428
and there’s now blood and teeth
pouring out

1048
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:22,431
and he’s clutching the side of it,
shaking his head.

1049
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,877
He’s in a really bad place right now

1050
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:28,481
and is looking over the back window,
realizing he’s probably going to -

1051
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,662
TALIESIN: Fuck it, let’s burn
an Action Surge. This’ll be funny.

1052
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:37,259
LAURA: Percy tastes blood.

1053
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:39,884
TALIESIN: That’s, 16, 17, 18, 19... 25?

1054
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:40,729
MATT: That hits.

1055
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:43,180
ASHLEY: Get him!

1056
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,763
TALIESIN: That’s 19 points of damage?

1057
00:48:46,763 --> 00:48:50,404
MATT: With that, as he’s turning around,
about to dart towards the window,

1058
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:52,038
as he spins around in his space,

1059
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:56,745
you take aim a second,
or now a third time on him, fire...

1060
00:48:56,745 --> 00:48:58,889
You watch. It’s obscured to see;

1061
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:02,063
all you see is the moonlight
from the outside sky coming through

1062
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:03,575
and the silhouette of his head,

1063
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:06,233
and now the missing silhouette
of his head -

1064
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,396
as you scatter the top half of his skull

1065
00:49:08,396 --> 00:49:11,110
across the stone
surrounding the window in Pike’s room.

1066
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,130
ASHLEY: Thanks, Percy.

1067
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,303
TALIESIN: I reload.

1068
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,687
ASHLEY: I had him, but thanks.

1069
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:20,910
TALIESIN: I drop a health potion
and then steady to take care of that

1070
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,726
and reload my guns
with the rest of my turn.

1071
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,648
MATT: Okay. Good to know.
All right. Ending Percy’s turn,

1072
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:31,363
you’re currently on the ground now,
you’re both prone.

1073
00:49:31,363 --> 00:49:35,417
Hotis stands up,
using half of his movement,

1074
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,809
looks down at you,

1075
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,262
"You’re clever."

1076
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:43,644
Which, for the record,
the illusion has faded.

1077
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:49,996
The Gilmore visage is no more.
Now you see before you the angry,

1078
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:53,931
curled bare-teeth face
of the familiar rakshasa.

1079
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:01,492
"The feeling’s mutual."

1080
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:05,703
As you are currently 
prone on the ground,

1081
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:09,323
it has advantage on you.

1082
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:13,353
It's going to go ahead and...

1083
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:16,569
make two strikes
with the dagger against you.

1084
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:21,408
With advantage,
yeah, that’ll be 25?

1085
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:23,317
LIAM: He didn’t redip, though.

1086
00:50:23,317 --> 00:50:25,042
I don’t remember you saying
he redipped, right?

1087
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,890
He used his poison last time
and I made the save?

1088
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,132
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Right? Okay.

1089
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:32,359
LIAM: So that hits. Uncanny Dodge?
MATT: Right. So the first one hits.

1090
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:37,468
MATT: You take...

1091
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:41,168
10 points of piercing damage. No poison.

1092
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:43,558
ASHLEY: I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
Sorry, I’m nervously playing with it.

1093
00:50:43,558 --> 00:50:44,727
LIAM: Sorry. One more time?
MATT: 10 points of piercing damage.

1094
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:45,623
LIAM: Yes.

1095
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:48,848
MATT: He’s going to dip the blade,

1096
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:50,877
remembering that he forgot that
after the first strike.

1097
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:53,524
Then with the second strike
he’s going to stab down once more.

1098
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:54,770
LIAM: That’s just a bonus to do that?

1099
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:59,164
MATT: Yeah. That’s going to be a 21.

1100
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:05,733
You suffer 11 points
of piercing damage.

1101
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:10,412
Plus 10 points of poison damage.

1102
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:11,724
LAURA: No more!
LIAM: I’m unconscious.

1103
00:51:11,724 --> 00:51:12,529
MATT: Unconscious.

1104
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:19,194
So as you get up,
he just stabs and stabs again,

1105
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:22,373
and this time as your finger’s extended
the pain hits you

1106
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:24,367
and you just watch your vision
fade to darkness.

1107
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:26,060
LAURA: No.

1108
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,866
MATT: That’s the end of his turn.

1109
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,626
He has no more attacks,
so he just watches you go limp.

1110
00:51:31,626 --> 00:51:33,918
LIAM: For my turn, I’ll be dead.
LAURA: No.

1111
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:36,880
MATT: All right.
Well, Scanlan, you’re up first.

1112
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,984
SAM: I go to the ledge and look over.

1113
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:41,644
MATT: Yeah, you look over the ledge,

1114
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:46,270
down about 70 feet,
80 feet on the stonework,

1115
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:51,697
you see and watch as the rakshasa,
now fully visible, Gilmore visage gone,

1116
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:57,451
jams the blade twice
into the currently laid-out back of Vax,

1117
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:01,304
as the back's body goes limp,
unconscious.

1118
00:52:01,304 --> 00:52:04,279
Drawing the blade, chuckling,
throwing it up in the air, catching it,

1119
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:06,932
and is preparing to go down
for some finishing blows.

1120
00:52:06,932 --> 00:52:11,397
SAM: Okay, shit.
My stuff doesn’t go that far, does it?

1121
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:15,738
Any of my vocal spells, only goes 60 -

1122
00:52:15,738 --> 00:52:17,414
MATT: Only about 60 feet, yeah.

1123
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:21,919
SAM: Yeah, fuck. All right.
Well then, for my action-slash-attack,

1124
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:25,920
I, overcome with fury
seeing my friend on the ground,

1125
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,733
pull out Mythcarver
and just fucking jump and plunge.

1126
00:52:30,733 --> 00:52:34,996
LAURA: Oh my god!
TALIESIN: Yes!

1127
00:52:34,996 --> 00:52:38,521
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yes yes yes.

1128
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:41,808
MATT: So you leap, (shhh) -

1129
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:44,425
SAM: And I have advantage
because I’ve inspired myself.

1130
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:47,580
(all laugh)

1131
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,371
MATT: I’ll say for the purposes
of this action,

1132
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:57,023
you will have advantage
on the strike, as -

1133
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:58,388
SAM: But I’m also exhausted.

1134
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:01,655
MATT: Right, but that doesn’t affect
your actual attack roll.

1135
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,199
That’s more your ability check.

1136
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,865
Actually, you should have
had disadvantage earlier for that.

1137
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:07,247
SAM: I rolled twice for that.
MATT: Oh, you did? Okay, good.

1138
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:10,290
MATT: So as you come down, quiet.

1139
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:15,183
Currently overcome with the now 
possibility of vengeance before it,

1140
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:19,549
the rakshasa does not seem
to notice you

1141
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:23,190
as you fall off silently, blade down,
(whoosh) wind rushing past your face,

1142
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,553
the tunnel-vision before you

1143
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:27,497
as you can see
this whole scene play out before you.

1144
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:29,984
The blade comes down, slamming.

1145
00:53:29,984 --> 00:53:34,690
Go ahead and roll with advantage
your attack against the rakshasa.

1146
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:42,740
SAM: 14. 15. Plus I don’t know what!
I don’t do these things!

1147
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,436
TRAVIS: I’ve never hit!
SAM: Strength? Is that strength?

1148
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,226
MATT: It should be written on your attack.

1149
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:49,156
It would be
your proficiency bonus plus your -

1150
00:53:49,156 --> 00:53:51,012
SAM: Oh, it’s +8.
MATT: Yeah, so.

1151
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,448
SAM: That’s a 23.
TALIESIN: 23.

1152
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:53,820
MATT: 23 definitely hits.
TRAVIS: Nice.

1153
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,968
SAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: Nicely done!

1154
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:59,311
SAM: I don’t know what to do now.
I roll a d8?

1155
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,886
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d8
plus damage.

1156
00:54:02,886 --> 00:54:07,705
SAM: Okay. 8 + 3, so that’s 11.

1157
00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:11,955
Plus 1d6 force damage. 6! Holy shit!

1158
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:13,651
(all laugh)

1159
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,366
TALIESIN: This is happening.
This is happening.

1160
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:18,234
SAM: So that’s 11, that’s 17. Right?

1161
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,974
MATT: 17?
SAM: Okay.

1162
00:54:19,974 --> 00:54:24,402
MATT: I’m adding to that attack
half of the damage you take from the fall.

1163
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:28,394
Because of the force 
of yourself and the blade.

1164
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:31,884
So the damage
you take from the fall...

1165
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:34,034
TRAVIS: I don’t know
what that expression was.

1166
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:35,810
LAURA: Yeah, I know,
is that good or bad? Both?

1167
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,676
TALIESIN: It’s either a lot or a little.

1168
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:41,353
MATT: 29 points of damage you suffer,

1169
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:44,217
slamming into the ground
and falling prone from the attack.

1170
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:48,523
But he does suffer
an additional 14 points of damage

1171
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:53,600
as the blade (sssh) just sinks
into the shoulder and the torso

1172
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,418
and he tenses in pain

1173
00:54:58,418 --> 00:55:00,889
as the blade is still jammed
into his form.

1174
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:04,434
You let go of it
as you slam into the ground

1175
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:10,825
and he draws it out with a spurt of blood
and throws it to the ground angrily,

1176
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:12,286
spinning around towards you,

1177
00:55:12,286 --> 00:55:16,048
still holding the dagger aloft,
looking over.

1178
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:18,533
SAM: Do I still get my bonus action?
MATT: You do, technically, yeah.

1179
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:22,460
SAM: Okay, so I, on the ground,
turn over to Vax

1180
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,290
and I’ll bonus Healing Word him.

1181
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,299
LAURA: Oh, thank god.

1182
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:30,422
SAM: And I will sing with whatever wind
I have left in my body,

1183
00:55:30,422 --> 00:55:35,770
"(singing) Vax’ildan,
you’re going to put up a good fight,

1184
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:41,504
"Vax’ildan,
I need you to put up a good fight.

1185
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:46,403
"Put up a good fight! 
Put up a good fight!"

1186
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:49,479
TRAVIS: (laughing) Is that "Roxanne?"
SAM: That’s "Roxanne."

1187
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,327
(all laugh)

1188
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:55,844
TRAVIS: I couldn’t even join in
because it was so good.

1189
00:55:55,844 --> 00:55:58,115
LIAM: So in love with you right now.
So in love with you.

1190
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:03,072
SAM: 4! I’m rolling great!

1191
00:56:03,072 --> 00:56:05,162
Plus 5. So you have 9 hit points!

1192
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:08,990
MATT: So you come back to consciousness
face-down on the ground,

1193
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,973
scattered out on the stonework

1194
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:13,302
and the last thing,
as your eyes come open,

1195
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:15,898
you hear the gentle tunes
of Scanlan’s voice

1196
00:56:15,898 --> 00:56:17,552
calling you back from the darkness.

1197
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:19,108
You glance out the corner of your eye

1198
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:23,190
and see that Hotis is still standing
with the dagger up on top.

1199
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,237
LIAM: It was just my turn
in the initiative. Can I go?

1200
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:29,055
MATT: No, your turn’s not yet.
We have Grog, Keyleth, and then you.

1201
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,042
They actually got initiative
higher than you, so.

1202
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:32,019
LIAM: Oh, okay, okay.

1203
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:36,135
MATT: We’re coming to you, don’t worry.
So your turn hasn’t happened yet.

1204
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:38,276
LIAM: Okay. I totally -
I trust in you, Matt.

1205
00:56:38,276 --> 00:56:42,674
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: And fear you.

1206
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:46,901
MATT: Good.
All right, that brings us to...

1207
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,520
Grog, you’re up.

1208
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,065
TRAVIS: So I heard him say,
"I’m going down," right?

1209
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:55,058
We all heard him say
he’s going down as he was falling?

1210
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:58,838
MATT: Roll an intelligence check.
SAM: Oh, boy.

1211
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:05,001
TRAVIS: This’ll be great. Ah! 18 minus...

1212
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:06,937
(all laugh)

1213
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:08,642
TRAVIS: Minus 2. 16.

1214
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:11,172
MATT: 16. It takes you a moment,

1215
00:57:11,172 --> 00:57:14,460
and you have to bite your tongue
for a moment

1216
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,848
as you’re running down the hallway,

1217
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,760
but you ascertain that probably means...

1218
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,211
It’s a tower,
Probably jumped off the tower!

1219
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:23,291
TRAVIS: Yeah, probably.
I look out and I say,

1220
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,719
"Oh, Pike,
you’re in your birthday suit!

1221
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,664
"Are you all right?"

1222
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:29,334
ASHLEY: Yeah, I’m fine,
I’m fine, I’m fine.

1223
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:31,454
SAM: She’s bleeding all over.

1224
00:57:31,454 --> 00:57:33,651
ASHLEY: Wait, did I take -
I took a potion on the -

1225
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,944
MATT: Well, he had the potion
on the ground.

1226
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:37,203
TALIESIN: I threw you a minor.
It’s not much.

1227
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,839
ASHLEY: I’m going to be fine,
I’m going to be fine.

1228
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:39,741
TRAVIS: Okay.

1229
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,921
Is there a window in the hallway?

1230
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:45,915
My question is,
is the courtyard through those windows?

1231
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,360
MATT: The courtyard
would be over here, actually.

1232
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,011
TRAVIS: Right. Is there -
MARISHA: In relation to where we are?

1233
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:52,633
MATT: This is no longer
really part of the deal,

1234
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:55,925
so in relation to where you guys are,
they’re about here.

1235
00:57:55,925 --> 00:57:59,603
TRAVIS: Do all of the rooms have windows,
or is there a window in the hallway?

1236
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:02,461
MATT: All of the rooms that have windows
are the ones on that side,

1237
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:04,214
so currently the only way to get here

1238
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,292
would be to travel
back where you came from

1239
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:09,746
and find an exit out to the top of the -

1240
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:11,220
TRAVIS: Fucking ass.

1241
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,020
MARISHA: I was going to
try and handle that.

1242
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,751
TALIESIN: Do those stairs go
to the west tower, by the way?

1243
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:17,574
MATT: These stairs go
to the west tower, yes.

1244
00:58:17,574 --> 00:58:18,344
TALIESIN: Cool, just checking.

1245
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:23,943
TRAVIS: Can I hold my...

1246
00:58:23,943 --> 00:58:25,963
turn until Keyleth goes?

1247
00:58:25,963 --> 00:58:27,334
MATT: All right.

1248
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:28,713
You can still move, though,
if you want to.

1249
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,279
TRAVIS: I will - where are you?

1250
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:34,821
MARISHA: I’m right behind you.
In the room, in the door behind you.

1251
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:37,926
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can go back in.
LAURA: Okay.

1252
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:42,581
TRAVIS: I should just stay there
if you’re going to make a door.

1253
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:45,417
MARISHA: Hey, Grog!
TRAVIS: What?

1254
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:47,956
MARISHA: You want to jump
from really high?

1255
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:49,267
TRAVIS: Yeah. I just want out.

1256
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:50,081
MARISHA: All right.

1257
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:54,713
TRAVIS: So I’ll hold until Keyleth goes,
and I won’t move.

1258
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:55,835
I’ll stay there,
because she’s right beside -

1259
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:56,573
MATT: What action are you holding?

1260
00:58:56,573 --> 00:59:01,432
TRAVIS: I will hold my... movement.

1261
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:04,477
MATT: Well, no, I mean, the movement
gets used in your turn regardless.

1262
00:59:04,477 --> 00:59:06,389
You just choose what action
you want to hold as a trigger,

1263
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:07,622
so if something’s going to happen,

1264
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:10,075
you would then use
whatever your action is.

1265
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,722
Your movement you have to use now,
or it’s lost.

1266
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,964
TRAVIS: I have to choose 
what she’s going to do? I'm so confused.

1267
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,943
LAURA: Well, you won’t be able to move
once she goes.

1268
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:19,191
You won’t be able to do an action
because you’re trapping yourself.

1269
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:21,581
TALIESIN: It's like, 
"I’m holding everything

1270
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,656
"until she makes a door."

1271
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:26,387
MATT: Your impulse hit now
and if you decide not to move,

1272
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:28,534
then the impulse
loses the movement, so.

1273
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:29,812
TRAVIS: I don’t know.
I don’t know what to say, I -

1274
00:59:29,812 --> 00:59:33,296
SAM: Yeah, you can’t really do anything.
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don’t move.

1275
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:37,442
MARISHA: He’s just holding his action -
TRAVIS: I decide to stand still.

1276
00:59:37,442 --> 00:59:38,992
SAM: Yeah, but just to get
through this portal,

1277
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,425
he’s going to have to move.
It’s a whole other turn.

1278
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:41,950
TRAVIS: Otherwise,
I’m running down a hallway for no reason.

1279
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:42,896
I just don’t move.

1280
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:46,100
I just stand there dumbfounded
that Pike is naked and cut to shit.

1281
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,394
MATT: Okay. That ends Grog’s turn.
You’re up.

1282
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:53,170
MARISHA: Okay. I’m going to reach over,
put on my circlet in my nightgown.

1283
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:54,392
MATT: Okay.

1284
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:58,920
MARISHA: And I’m going to step out,
look left and right.

1285
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,776
Okay. And then,
going off what Grog was saying,

1286
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,361
I’m going to walk behind Grog
and I’m going to do Stone Shape.

1287
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:13,429
I’m going to blast a door into that wall,
blast a giant hole. Yeah.

1288
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:17,623
MATT: All right. (boof)
As you tear this wall open there -

1289
01:00:17,623 --> 01:00:19,249
MARISHA: Yeah, dude. Yeah.
LAURA: Awesome.

1290
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:22,948
MATT: - it opens up before you

1291
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:28,605
and you can see a little bit of it
gets pushed to the side,

1292
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:32,004
because it’s a little bit elevated
from the the roof area,

1293
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,841
but you force it upward

1294
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:35,485
to where it bursts open
and creates a slight ramp

1295
01:00:35,485 --> 01:00:38,070
that leads up
to what would be the roof

1296
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,100
of this part of Whitestone Castle.

1297
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:46,042
MARISHA: Okay. Cool. And then I’ll -
Can I see Pike from where I am?

1298
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:46,885
MATT: You can, yes.

1299
01:00:46,885 --> 01:00:47,973
MARISHA: I’m going to look at her

1300
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:52,796
and give her a Healing Word,
just a level 1 Healing Word.

1301
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:53,712
MATT: All right.

1302
01:00:53,712 --> 01:00:56,325
MARISHA: You are going to heal -
ASHLEY: Thanks, pal.

1303
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:58,082
MARISHA: Oh, it’s not great.
Sorry.

1304
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:06,015
MARISHA: So 7 points.
ASHLEY: I’ll take it.

1305
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,079
MATT: All right.

1306
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,444
You still have a little bit of movement
if you want to use it.

1307
01:01:12,444 --> 01:01:15,217
MARISHA: I’ll step back a little bit
out of Grog’s way.

1308
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,215
MATT: Okay. There you go.

1309
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,694
MARISHA: Not that, back towards you.

1310
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:20,735
MATT: Okay, got you.

1311
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:22,616
So it’d be there, probably,
far as you can get.

1312
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:23,837
MARISHA: Sure, yeah.
So he can get by.

1313
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:27,292
MATT: All right, cool.
That brings us to Vax. Your turn.

1314
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,720
MARISHA: Oh, Grog.

1315
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,881
TRAVIS: No, but I can’t do anything.
MARISHA: You can’t do anything?

1316
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:32,664
MARISHA: Oh, I thought he held -

1317
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:34,249
MATT: You didn’t say
you were holding an action for anything.

1318
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:37,059
TRAVIS: I wanted to move through the door
once she made it.

1319
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:39,645
MATT: I’ll let you do it.
You’re generally not supposed to do -

1320
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,672
TRAVIS: What do I say, I hold a dash?
Or a hold a movement?

1321
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:43,130
MATT: Say you hold a dash. 
You could do that, yeah.

1322
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,099
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.
I would like to hold a dash.

1323
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,974
MATT: Okay. So yeah,
then you just go ahead and -

1324
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:48,718
TRAVIS: We’re still learning.

1325
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:51,882
TALIESIN: You can hold a dash
for Keyleth’s turn.

1326
01:01:51,882 --> 01:01:55,390
TALIESIN AND TRAVIS:
Hold a dash for Keyleth’s turn.

1327
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,099
TALIESIN: And then she moves
and then you go.

1328
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:58,680
TRAVIS: I didn’t do my homework.

1329
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,207
MATT: So as Keyleth opens the window,
you dash up and rush onto the rooftop,

1330
01:02:02,207 --> 01:02:04,048
and there you can see
across the way...

1331
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:06,868
MARISHA: I give him a good-game
smack on the ass as he runs by.

1332
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:09,855
SAM: Naked ass.
LAURA: He’s got his normal clothes on.

1333
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:11,557
LIAM: Always naked.
TALIESIN: He’s naked.

1334
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:12,637
LAURA: We’re all naked.

1335
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:14,225
TRAVIS: Well, I only sleep naked
in the lady-favors house.

1336
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:15,203
LIAM: Question.

1337
01:02:15,203 --> 01:02:17,114
Grabbing a weapon off the ground,
that’s a freebie, right?

1338
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:19,763
Is that a bonus action?
I feel like that’s - I think that’s free?

1339
01:02:19,763 --> 01:02:21,350
MATT: As part of an action,
you can pick it -

1340
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,769
LIAM: Part of an action?
All right, great.

1341
01:02:22,769 --> 01:02:28,376
I’m going to thank the Raven Queen
for my family

1342
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:33,903
and cast Lay on Hands on myself,
take back 5 hit points.

1343
01:02:33,903 --> 01:02:35,856
I see Mythcarver on the ground.

1344
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:37,429
I’m going to grab it
and use my movement to stand,

1345
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,347
and I also noticed
that we’re flanking Hotis,

1346
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:41,576
so I’m going to sneak-attack
the motherfucker up the back.

1347
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:43,311
MATT: All right. Just as a note,

1348
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:48,611
the way that the bonus attack works -
well, this is with your haste ability.

1349
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,605
LIAM: Yeah, I’m hasted.
The bonus action was -

1350
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:53,492
Oh, no, the action, right.
The action was the spell.

1351
01:02:53,492 --> 01:02:56,252
MATT: The haste would’ve faded
once you went unconscious.

1352
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:59,135
LIAM: Oh, okay. That’s okay.
I have one action still.

1353
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:02,374
MATT: Well, you have an action,
and then you have your offhand strike.

1354
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:05,258
Offhand strike works
as part of the attack action.

1355
01:03:05,258 --> 01:03:10,331
If you use your action for anything else,
you don’t get the bonus attack.

1356
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:13,449
MARISHA: So is picking something up
not a free action?

1357
01:03:13,449 --> 01:03:15,672
I thought picking up a weapon
was a free action.

1358
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:18,185
MATT: It’s part of an action.

1359
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:19,301
Don’t worry about it.
It’s fine, let’s do it.

1360
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:21,022
LIAM: I didn’t even -
no no no, do it the real way, man.

1361
01:03:21,022 --> 01:03:22,419
I don’t want any mulligans.

1362
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:23,582
MATT: No, the idea would be,

1363
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:27,188
you don’t get a free bonus attack
with any other action.

1364
01:03:27,188 --> 01:03:30,324
It’s whatever you’re attacking,
you then get to throw this in this way.

1365
01:03:30,324 --> 01:03:31,288
LIAM: Well, let me ask you this

1366
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:32,286
because if I understood that
I wouldn’t have cast the spell,

1367
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:34,333
so I’m happy to skip the spell
and then cut the -

1368
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,112
MATT: Okay, that’s fine. We’ll do that.

1369
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:37,716
As part of the action economy,

1370
01:03:37,716 --> 01:03:41,022
the idea is
that because you’re attacking with one,

1371
01:03:41,022 --> 01:03:43,200
you can give yourself an opening
to get a quick strike with the other.

1372
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,289
LIAM: So it has to go with another attack.
Now I understand.

1373
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,512
So if I had understood -
thank you, thank you.

1374
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:50,170
I’ll take that mulligan for understanding.

1375
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,506
So now I’m going to stab him
with Mythcarver through the back.

1376
01:03:52,506 --> 01:03:54,668
LIAM: Flanked.
MATT: Yes.

1377
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:57,629
LIAM: And flanked is at advantage, yeah?

1378
01:03:57,629 --> 01:04:01,937
MATT: No.
LIAM: An ally nearby, was it not?

1379
01:04:01,937 --> 01:04:04,951
MATT: Technically, he’s not flanked
because the other ally is prone

1380
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:06,493
and is not currently
threatening his face -

1381
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:09,878
LIAM: All right, that misses, then.
MARISHA: Fucking fuck.

1382
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:13,976
LIAM: So I’ve used an action
but not the bonus action,

1383
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,516
so I’m going to disengage.

1384
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:16,726
MATT: Okay.

1385
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:21,369
LIAM: And I’m going to dart back,
as far away from him as I can get.

1386
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:24,415
ASHLEY, LAURA, AND TALIESIN: 
(silly voices) D&D!

1387
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:27,956
LIAM: 12 speed - the boots are off.
6, got it. Yeah, got it.

1388
01:04:27,956 --> 01:04:29,374
MATT: All right, there you go.

1389
01:04:29,374 --> 01:04:32,864
That brings us to...

1390
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:37,544
At this point,
waiting around this way.

1391
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:41,305
As you guys are all distracted
at this point,

1392
01:04:41,305 --> 01:04:42,766
turns around, takes a dagger.

1393
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:44,322
MARISHA: Who?

1394
01:04:44,322 --> 01:04:46,134
LAURA: There’s another guy?
MARISHA: Where did he come from?

1395
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,674
TALIESIN: That’s the one
that ran that way. He’s mine.

1396
01:04:48,674 --> 01:04:51,046
MARISHA: That yours? The little shit.

1397
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:53,524
LIAM: By the way,
the Whitestone guards are shit.

1398
01:04:53,524 --> 01:04:56,465
MARISHA: Yeah, no shit.
LAURA: This is all happening so fast!

1399
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:59,556
LIAM: Don’t they stand on the wall?
Don’t they stand on places?

1400
01:04:59,556 --> 01:05:00,572
SAM: It’s movie night.

1401
01:05:00,572 --> 01:05:03,980
They’re all watching The Sound of Music
in the rec room.

1402
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,369
TRAVIS: Vasselheim, yeah,
they’re on the lax.

1403
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:07,891
LIAM: Whitestone, Whitestone.
TRAVIS: I mean Whitestone.

1404
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:10,944
MATT: This is all, like, 3 a.m.
at Whitestone Castle right now.

1405
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,617
That being the case,
the guard makes two dagger attacks.

1406
01:05:18,617 --> 01:05:22,762
One at you, Percy,
and one at you, Pike.

1407
01:05:22,762 --> 01:05:25,811
That’s natural 20 against you, Percy.

1408
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:27,608
TALIESIN: Natural 20 against me?
MATT: Yes.

1409
01:05:27,608 --> 01:05:30,787
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.
Where’s my goddamn - ah, shit.

1410
01:05:30,787 --> 01:05:32,110
SAM: What do you need?
What? What’s wrong?

1411
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:33,184
MATT: No, it’s okay. He rolled a 1.

1412
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,302
So you take
6 points of piercing damage.

1413
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:37,574
TALIESIN: I was going to try and grab it.

1414
01:05:37,574 --> 01:05:40,480
I’m just trying to find my -
my dagger seems to have vanished.

1415
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,709
Yeah, I can’t find my dagger
for some reason. My gloves.

1416
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:48,381
MATT: That would be 18 against you, Pike?
That does hit you.

1417
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:49,438
ASHLEY: Does hit.

1418
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:51,180
MATT: You take 4 points
of piercing damage.

1419
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,395
ASHLEY: Okay okay okay okay okay.
TRAVIS: Okay okay okay.

1420
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:58,719
TALIESIN: I think the snare glove is 1d8.
MATT: 1d10, actually.

1421
01:05:58,719 --> 01:05:59,763
TALIESIN: 1d10. That’s even better.

1422
01:05:59,763 --> 01:06:03,043
MATT: Because he hit you first -
ASHLEY: I’m still alive.

1423
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:06,392
MATT: - it’s sneak attack
on top of that. He was hidden.

1424
01:06:06,392 --> 01:06:11,764
So that was 6, plus...

1425
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:19,804
34 points of piercing damage, all together.

1426
01:06:19,804 --> 01:06:26,699
TALIESIN: Dropped to 23.

1427
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:27,704
MATT: Okay.

1428
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:34,517
TALIESIN: Yeah. so. That’s right.

1429
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:36,636
MARISHA: Yeah, don’t do that.

1430
01:06:36,636 --> 01:06:38,548
TALIESIN: No, I’m not thinking.
There we go.

1431
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:39,587
MATT: All righty.

1432
01:06:39,587 --> 01:06:40,701
MARISHA: All right.

1433
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:43,913
MATT: That finishes their turn.
Vex, you’re up.

1434
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:45,762
LAURA: Me?
MATT: Yes.

1435
01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:49,658
LAURA: Okay, the wall just opened up,

1436
01:06:49,658 --> 01:06:53,260
so I’m going to shout for Trinket

1437
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,395
to run after the assassin
throwing the knives.

1438
01:06:55,395 --> 01:06:56,543
MATT: Okay.

1439
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:58,749
LAURA: And I’m going to run
out the doorway.

1440
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:04,323
If I go up on my broom,

1441
01:07:04,323 --> 01:07:05,882
will I be able to see them
down in the courtyard?

1442
01:07:05,882 --> 01:07:08,859
MATT: From this perspective? No.

1443
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,833
LAURA: I mean, if I run out the door -
right, right.

1444
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:13,724
MATT: If you run out the door...
is this all on the broom?

1445
01:07:13,724 --> 01:07:19,513
LAURA: Well, if I’m in the air,
can I see down at...

1446
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:24,736
MATT: You’d be able to from -

1447
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,156
MARISHA: Jazz hands?

1448
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,238
TALIESIN: (singing) You’ll be swell.

1449
01:07:32,238 --> 01:07:33,885
TALIESIN, ASHLEY, AND LAURA:
(singing) You’ll be great.

1450
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:35,724
TRAVIS: (singing)
You’ve got the world on...

1451
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:37,329
TRAVIS AND ASHLEY: (singing) a plate.

1452
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:40,444
MATT: Yeah, so from up there
as you (shhh) shoot out above,

1453
01:07:40,444 --> 01:07:44,212
looking down, you can see
where they lie on the battlefield there.

1454
01:07:44,212 --> 01:07:47,125
LAURA: I want to shoot the rakshasa!

1455
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:50,251
(all laugh)

1456
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:52,086
MATT: Go for it.

1457
01:07:52,086 --> 01:07:56,804
LAURA: Yes! I’m going to use
my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel.

1458
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:57,774
MATT: All righty.

1459
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:02,540
SAM: You were born for this stuff.
ASHLEY: I want to shoot the rakshasa!

1460
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,383
LAURA: Okay.
I make an attack roll for three arrows.

1461
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:13,458
Okay, that’s a good one. That is 31.

1462
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:16,182
MATT: 31? Hits.
LAURA: Yes. As the first hit.

1463
01:08:16,182 --> 01:08:19,912
LAURA: 19 is the second?

1464
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:22,688
MATT: That does hit.
TRAVIS: Nice.

1465
01:08:22,688 --> 01:08:24,685
LAURA: And 22 is the third.

1466
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:27,444
MATT: Okay. Just as a note,
what’s your alignment?

1467
01:08:27,444 --> 01:08:32,850
LAURA: No, I’m neutral.
Chaotic neutral.

1468
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,180
MATT: Okay, cool, just checking.
All right, so go ahead and roll damage.

1469
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,663
LAURA: Why?!
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

1470
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:40,965
LIAM: I know what it means.
SAM: I don’t know what it means.

1471
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:42,886
TRAVIS: You do know what it means?
LIAM: I do.

1472
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:44,158
LAURA: Does that mean

1473
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:45,596
I do not as good damage to him
or something?

1474
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:48,416
LIAM: Sort of.
LAURA: God darn it. Okay, wait.

1475
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:51,566
TRAVIS: That fucking smirk.
LIAM: Sort of.

1476
01:08:51,566 --> 01:08:55,510
LAURA: Hold on. I’m just
going to roll the first attack,

1477
01:08:55,510 --> 01:09:01,443
because I’m stupid.
Great. 12 for the first

1478
01:09:01,443 --> 01:09:03,426
because I forgot
to Hunter’s Mark him

1479
01:09:03,426 --> 01:09:04,402
because I’m a genius

1480
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:07,059
because I’m just so worked up
because my brother’s in trouble.

1481
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,283
TRAVIS: As per uzh.

1482
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:12,278
LAURA: Gosh darn it.
LIAM: This shit ain’t my fault.

1483
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:13,695
MATT: As a note,
your rage would have faded

1484
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:15,157
because you had gotten no damage,

1485
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:17,344
but you also could have used
your bonus action last turn

1486
01:09:17,344 --> 01:09:18,207
for your rage.

1487
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,545
TRAVIS: Which I totally whispered,
but just not loud enough.

1488
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:22,675
MATT: That's what I figured.

1489
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:25,404
SAM: We’re on point today.
TRAVIS: You are omnipotent, my man.

1490
01:09:25,404 --> 01:09:27,330
LAURA: 9 for the second attack.

1491
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,393
MATT: All righty.

1492
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:33,689
LAURA: Oh, I haven’t been adding
for the bracers.

1493
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:36,114
Add 4 extra to what I told you.

1494
01:09:36,114 --> 01:09:37,420
MATT: All righty.

1495
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,829
LAURA: 18 for the last.
MATT: Nice.

1496
01:09:44,829 --> 01:09:47,383
LAURA: No, 20 for the last.

1497
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:50,171
I’m sorry, Matt.
I’m freaking out.

1498
01:09:50,171 --> 01:09:52,182
LIAM: So cruel, so cruel, so cruel.

1499
01:09:52,182 --> 01:09:54,420
MATT: You rush up in the air,
and these were with disadvantage

1500
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,931
on all the attack rolls
because you’re on your broom?

1501
01:09:58,735 --> 01:10:00,785
TALIESIN: I swear
I’ll finish it eventually.

1502
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:02,114
I swear, I swear.

1503
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:04,625
MATT: Roll three more dice
and we’ll see if I negate any of these.

1504
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,138
First one is?

1505
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:06,975
LIAM: (laughs) 1.

1506
01:10:06,975 --> 01:10:12,968
MATT: First attack, nope,
and I need you to roll a dexterity check.

1507
01:10:16,123 --> 01:10:18,016
LAURA: Natural 20.
SAM: Whoa!

1508
01:10:18,016 --> 01:10:19,770
MATT: Okay, so you stay on the broom,
you don’t fall off.

1509
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,985
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: She’s surfing on the broom.

1510
01:10:20,985 --> 01:10:22,630
LIAM: No pressure.
MATT: Roll -

1511
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:25,637
LAURA: The second one I already rolled.
It's a 25 for the second.

1512
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:28,940
MATT: Okay.
Roll again for the third one.

1513
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,718
LAURA: (fake-cries)

1514
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,329
LAURA: What is that? 20.
ASHLEY: 21.

1515
01:10:37,329 --> 01:10:39,445
LAURA: 21 for the last.
MATT: Okay, so the last two still hit.

1516
01:10:39,445 --> 01:10:42,902
LAURA: Okay, do I have to roll...
oh no, do I have to roll again for -

1517
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:45,445
TRAVIS: No, you stayed on.
MATT: No, you stayed on. You’re fine.

1518
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:47,667
MATT: Essentially, as you rushed up,
you saw him, you took aim,

1519
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:50,412
but you almost fell off the side.
The first arrow goes far.

1520
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,861
The other two that split off
do manage to make their hit,

1521
01:10:52,861 --> 01:10:54,684
but the first one
does streak off into the sky.

1522
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,439
You right yourself back up on the broom,
but that’s the end of your turn.

1523
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:59,173
LAURA: Wait, I get another attack.

1524
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:00,672
MATT: You do,
because that was the first one.

1525
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:01,972
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll.

1526
01:11:01,972 --> 01:11:05,332
LAURA: My second one -
can I use my bonus action? Sorry.

1527
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:07,614
MATT: No.

1528
01:11:07,614 --> 01:11:09,414
LAURA: Not in between my two attacks?

1529
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:12,265
MATT: What are you going to use it for?

1530
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:14,324
LAURA: Hunter’s Mark!
MATT: Okay.

1531
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:21,019
TALIESIN: It’s really just a stink-eye.
ASHLEY: I want to shoot the rakshasa!

1532
01:11:21,019 --> 01:11:26,790
MATT: You watch as your mark...
has no effect.

1533
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,542
TRAVIS: It has no effect?

1534
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,751
LAURA: Oh, that’s right.
He’s a rakshasa. He’s an asshole.

1535
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,853
TRAVIS: Why does it have no effect?

1536
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:34,778
TRAVIS: Tigers resist Hunter’s Mark?
LAURA: I don’t know why.

1537
01:11:34,778 --> 01:11:36,193
MATT: You’ve never actually
fought one before, Laura.

1538
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:37,300
LAURA: No, I don’t know why, but -
ASHLEY: Tiger’s resistance?

1539
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,144
LAURA: - he didn’t seem to be affected.
ASHLEY: Tiger bomb?

1540
01:11:39,144 --> 01:11:40,621
TALIESIN: It’s the eye of the tiger.
MARISHA: Tiger bomb.

1541
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:41,987
MATT: You try and focus
your intent on attacking him

1542
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:44,245
and yet it doesn’t seem to find its form.

1543
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:49,509
LAURA: 19 for the last, with disadvantage.
MATT: That does hit. Roll the last attack.

1544
01:11:49,509 --> 01:11:51,506
LAURA: Okay. Okay okay okay.

1545
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,723
LIAM: Okay okay okay.

1546
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,362
MATT: Pike, you’re up next.

1547
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:02,461
LAURA: Oh, no,
I don’t get any additional -

1548
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:05,234
MATT: Nope.
LAURA: - so that’s just 14.

1549
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,101
TRAVIS: Why don’t you get any additional?

1550
01:12:07,101 --> 01:12:08,534
LAURA: Because I don’t get
any storm damage.

1551
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:09,872
MATT: So you pull -
LAURA: Oh, but -

1552
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,489
MATT: B-b-b!
LAURA: No, I didn’t say that was true.

1553
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:14,000
LAURA: I didn’t say that was
through the flaming bowstring, did I?

1554
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,293
Because I was so distracted
by the Hunter’s Mark.

1555
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:20,166
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn.
Pike, you’re up.

1556
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:25,706
ASHLEY: Okay, so I’m going to
cast Cure Wounds on myself.

1557
01:12:25,706 --> 01:12:27,492
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1558
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:31,711
MATT: What level?
ASHLEY: 5.

1559
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:32,869
SAM: Yeah!

1560
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:36,818
MATT: (laughs) 5th. Go for it.
So 5d8.

1561
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:44,608
ASHLEY AND TRAVIS: (count quietly)

1562
01:12:44,608 --> 01:12:47,928
SAM: 5d8?
MATT: Yeah, 5d8 + 5.

1563
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,764
TRAVIS: 21.

1564
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:53,073
ASHLEY: That’s the last one?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1565
01:12:53,073 --> 01:12:56,302
ASHLEY: Okay, 21 points.
MATT: You heal yourself 21 points.

1566
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:02,890
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: What else you doing now?

1567
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,705
MATT: You see Trinket
run around the corner

1568
01:13:04,705 --> 01:13:06,449
and is now currently in the face
of the assassin

1569
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,947
that just threw a blade at you.

1570
01:13:07,947 --> 01:13:09,986
And the rest of the party’s
running through this hole.

1571
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:12,490
ASHLEY: How close can I get to the hole?

1572
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:16,698
MATT: You can get about there.

1573
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:18,498
ASHLEY: Okay.
So I’m going to go to there.

1574
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:20,284
MATT: Okay, so you run around
to that area there.

1575
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:26,817
ASHLEY: And then I’m going to
create a Spiritual Weapon.

1576
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:27,753
MATT: Okay.

1577
01:13:27,753 --> 01:13:34,662
ASHLEY: Can I send it
down to the rakshasa?

1578
01:13:34,662 --> 01:13:36,443
MATT: You don’t know
where the rakshasa is.

1579
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:37,794
ASHLEY: I don’t know
where the rakshasa is.

1580
01:13:37,794 --> 01:13:39,091
MATT: You have no idea, no visual cue.

1581
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:41,338
You just see a hole in the stone wall
that everyone’s rushing through

1582
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:42,833
and that’s the most that you know.

1583
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,518
ASHLEY: Okay, so you know what?
Can I nix that?

1584
01:13:45,518 --> 01:13:46,474
MATT: Yep, you can do that.

1585
01:13:46,474 --> 01:13:48,622
ASHLEY: I’m going to
cast Shield of Faith on myself.

1586
01:13:48,622 --> 01:13:50,462
MATT: Okay.

1587
01:13:50,462 --> 01:13:54,411
ASHLEY: So that will bring me up to -
because I’m 13 right now with the shield?

1588
01:13:54,411 --> 01:13:55,822
MATT: Yes, that’ll bring you to 15.

1589
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,570
So you have that
on your concentration.

1590
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,611
Good call. Percy, you’re up.

1591
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:03,696
TALIESIN: Can I see that jerk
who just threw the knife at me?

1592
01:14:03,696 --> 01:14:06,851
MATT: No, he ducked around the corner
and Trinket gave chase.

1593
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:09,549
TALIESIN: Okay, I’m going to
roll towards that corner as well.

1594
01:14:09,549 --> 01:14:11,727
MATT: This corner?
TALIESIN: Yeah, I’m going that way.

1595
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:15,778
MATT: Come around the corner that way
and you see Trinket harrying the guy.

1596
01:14:15,778 --> 01:14:17,283
LIAM: Run, Steve Martin, run.

1597
01:14:17,283 --> 01:14:21,087
TALIESIN: (laughs)
I’m taking some shots at him.

1598
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:25,112
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter.

1599
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:27,525
LAURA: Trinket instinctually ducks.

1600
01:14:27,525 --> 01:14:33,432
TALIESIN: I will not hit Trinket. 24?

1601
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:34,722
MATT: Hits.

1602
01:14:37,362 --> 01:14:42,070
TALIESIN: Yeah, that’ll do it.
25 points of damage.

1603
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:43,984
MATT: Hoo.
LAURA: Yeah.

1604
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:47,582
MATT: (gunshot) Giant blast
as one of his shoulders is blown back.

1605
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:50,256
You see a spatter of blood
across the stairs behind him

1606
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:52,277
and he almost stumbles
back into the stairs.

1607
01:14:52,277 --> 01:14:54,948
Trinket’s using this position
to move even closer and snarl.

1608
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,307
He’s feeling closed off.

1609
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:57,530
TALIESIN: Taking another shot.
MATT: Go for it.

1610
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,717
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter.

1611
01:14:58,717 --> 01:15:01,459
That’s 19?

1612
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:03,671
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1613
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:11,641
TALIESIN: Hee! 24.

1614
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:14,589
ASHLEY: Dang.
MATT: All righty.

1615
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:15,936
TALIESIN: Another shot.
LIAM: Consistent.

1616
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:18,288
MATT: (tssh) This one
actually hits him

1617
01:15:18,288 --> 01:15:20,717
right above the pectoral muscle

1618
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:23,820
and blows him back,
now almost leaning against the stairs,

1619
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,375
these two big wounds
right in the middle of his chest.

1620
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,366
SAM: I think you’ll
probably have mercy on him, right?

1621
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:30,664
TALIESIN: Yeah, no,
I’m actually going to hire him.

1622
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:31,853
He’s been great.

1623
01:15:33,893 --> 01:15:35,404
MARISHA: Could be an intern.

1624
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:41,253
TALIESIN: (laughs) I can’t count
when you do that. 24.

1625
01:15:41,253 --> 01:15:43,583
MATT: 24?
TALIESIN: 24.

1626
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,937
MATT: All right, that hits.

1627
01:15:44,937 --> 01:15:48,990
TALIESIN: Come on. 18.
SAM: Jesus.

1628
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:52,391
MARISHA: Kill him. Kill him.

1629
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:57,705
TALIESIN: 6 + 10.
But I get a -5 to my attack.

1630
01:15:57,705 --> 01:16:02,611
MATT: Yeah, with this one,
as you pull back, final shot,

1631
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:05,829
you fire and it (fwoomp),
right through the forehead.

1632
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:08,796
Eyes roll back as Trinket lunges
and tears the throat out.

1633
01:16:08,796 --> 01:16:11,308
TALIESIN: I keep running by them
right up the hill.

1634
01:16:11,308 --> 01:16:13,648
LAURA: Midnight snack!
LIAM: Take it, DiCaprio!

1635
01:16:13,648 --> 01:16:15,616
MATT: That’s as far as you make it,
full movement.

1636
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:17,880
LAURA: He does the paw thing.

1637
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,144
ASHLEY: Wait,
are all the assassins gone now?

1638
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:24,351
MATT: You only saw two.

1639
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:27,208
ASHLEY: And you just killed one.

1640
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,600
TALIESIN: Mine’s dead and yours is dead.
ASHLEY: Or two. Okay.

1641
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,736
TALIESIN: We don’t know about any others.
TRAVIS: He smoked both of them, yeah.

1642
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:33,317
MATT: All right.
That ends your turn, Percy.

1643
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:35,117
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: All right.

1644
01:16:35,117 --> 01:16:36,390
SAM: Trinket’s the best
at killing dead guys.

1645
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,460
LAURA: He is so good at it.

1646
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:41,708
MATT: Everyone rushes in,
the rakshasa glares around.

1647
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,245
LAURA: No!
MARISHA: Oh, this motherfucker.

1648
01:16:44,245 --> 01:16:46,825
ASHLEY: Don’t you leave!
LIAM: He's going for spells!

1649
01:16:46,825 --> 01:16:49,617
TRAVIS: We’re still on the roof.
It’s just Scanlan and Vax down there.

1650
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:51,673
TRAVIS: He’s not intimidated yet.
LAURA: I shot him, though.

1651
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,935
TRAVIS: He doesn’t see us.
MARISHA: I hope he’s got a Counterspell...

1652
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:59,669
TRAVIS: He doesn’t know where it’s coming.
Right? (high-pitched) Right?

1653
01:16:59,669 --> 01:17:01,932
TALIESIN: (singing)
Sam has got a Counterspell.

1654
01:17:08,202 --> 01:17:10,992
LAURA: What are you - what’s happening?

1655
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:13,716
MARISHA: (singing) When you’re a Jet,
you’re a Jet all the way.

1656
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:14,987
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: I don't know.

1657
01:17:14,987 --> 01:17:16,858
LIAM: Rakshasa.
SAM: He’s doing math.

1658
01:17:16,858 --> 01:17:18,283
MATT: All righty.

1659
01:17:18,283 --> 01:17:20,692
SAM: It’s a Beautiful Mind moment
right now.

1660
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:22,802
LIAM: He does want to join Vox Monica.

1661
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,444
TALIESIN: This is what it's like
on this end,

1662
01:17:24,444 --> 01:17:26,297
going, "what the fuck do I do?" 
Thank you.

1663
01:17:26,297 --> 01:17:29,026
MARISHA: You know, there’s 
a mathematical equation for your stripes?

1664
01:17:29,026 --> 01:17:31,165
LIAM: Well, he reads thoughts
but he gets them backwards, sometimes.

1665
01:17:31,165 --> 01:17:34,652
SAM: He’s thinking
about that great Loot Crate deal.

1666
01:17:34,652 --> 01:17:38,771
LIAM: Vox Merkernerkerk.
LAURA: Verks Merkernerk.

1667
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:42,808
ASHLEY: Vox Monica. 
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

1668
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:45,090
ASHLEY: Vox Phoebe. 
TRAVIS: He’s really thinking about this.

1669
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:48,267
ASHLEY: Vox Ross. Vox Chandler.
SAM: How many people will die instantly

1670
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:51,580
SAM: - if I set off
a thermonuclear bomb in my pocket?

1671
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,445
MATT: All right. So.

1672
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:58,718
LAURA: Vox Joey.
TRAVIS: Joey.

1673
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:03,664
MATT: So. Hotis, first, is going to...

1674
01:18:03,664 --> 01:18:09,244
reach back and pull out -

1675
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:12,033
no actually, no.
Hotis is going to look up

1676
01:18:12,033 --> 01:18:15,050
at the creature that just
flew in on the broom.

1677
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,123
ASHLEY: Look away.

1678
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:18,003
MATT: Looks at you and says,

1679
01:18:18,003 --> 01:18:20,489
"You’ll do."

1680
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:23,168
MATT: Right as the eye contact hits you -
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1681
01:18:23,168 --> 01:18:24,791
MARISHA: He’s going to fucking 
Finger of Death.

1682
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:26,616
MATT: - you feel a presence
begin to push into your head.

1683
01:18:26,616 --> 01:18:28,285
I need you to roll
a wisdom saving throw.

1684
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:31,012
LIAM: At advantage, being a half-elf.
LAURA: Is it a charm?

1685
01:18:31,012 --> 01:18:32,640
MARISHA: Yeah, he’s trying to charm.

1686
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,078
LAURA: Okay okay okay!
LIAM: Okay okay okay.

1687
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:39,804
LAURA: Sheesh! Okay.
LIAM: Ah, we’re good.

1688
01:18:39,804 --> 01:18:42,096
LAURA: And what is it, wisdom?
MATT: Wisdom.

1689
01:18:42,096 --> 01:18:45,517
LAURA: 18 plus 3 is 21?

1690
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:47,890
MATT: 21, all right.
You resist the effect.

1691
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,741
TRAVIS: What was he doing?
What was the effect?

1692
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:52,246
MARISHA: Trying to charm you, man.

1693
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:54,978
LIAM: It was what he did to me
the last time we faced him.

1694
01:18:54,978 --> 01:18:56,409
TRAVIS: Oh, really?
LIAM: Yeah.

1695
01:18:56,409 --> 01:18:58,319
MARISHA: Only half of us
know how this fucker works.

1696
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:00,104
LIAM: Now he does nothing at all.
LAURA: I don’t know what he is.

1697
01:19:00,104 --> 01:19:01,155
MARISHA: Wait...

1698
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:02,481
TALIESIN: I wasn’t there.

1699
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:04,097
MARISHA: It was just -
was it just me and you?

1700
01:19:04,097 --> 01:19:05,172
LIAM: Yeah.

1701
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:06,681
MARISHA: Oh my god,
it was just me and you.

1702
01:19:06,681 --> 01:19:08,820
TALIESIN: Yeah, we’ve never, we have no...

1703
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,187
LIAM: (sings) We’ve only just met.

1704
01:19:10,187 --> 01:19:12,827
ASHLEY: (sings) We’ve only just begun.

1705
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:16,195
MATT: Yeah, he’s going to get
quite a way aways from you guys.

1706
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:18,455
ASHLEY: Where’s he going?

1707
01:19:20,975 --> 01:19:23,006
MATT: I’d say because you’re prone,

1708
01:19:23,006 --> 01:19:24,342
you do get
one attack of opportunity on him -

1709
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,174
no, you dropped the blade.
The blade is not at your feet,

1710
01:19:26,174 --> 01:19:27,995
so you can punch him if you want
as he runs by.

1711
01:19:27,995 --> 01:19:30,698
SAM: Oh, if he runs away
I can cast a spell on him.

1712
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:33,006
MARISHA: Yeah. Warcaster.

1713
01:19:35,376 --> 01:19:38,673
MATT: From prone.
I’ll let it happen, sure.

1714
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,093
MARISHA: You can cast
when you’re on your back.

1715
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:43,031
MATT: 5 feet of you. I’ll let you do it.
What do you want to do?

1716
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:45,302
SAM: Well, it’s not the rule, though,
I don’t want any preferential -

1717
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:48,442
MATT: No, it’s not against the rules.
It's a weird in-between.

1718
01:19:48,442 --> 01:19:50,207
You’re on the ground
after falling from the top.

1719
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:52,101
SAM: Yeah, I’m hurt,
so maybe it wouldn’t work.

1720
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:53,648
MATT: Yeah, but you see him running away

1721
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:55,937
and you can still cast from the ground,
so go for it.

1722
01:19:55,937 --> 01:19:57,356
What do you want to cast?

1723
01:19:57,356 --> 01:19:59,195
SAM: Okay. Well,

1724
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:01,717
what I was going to cast
before he ran away

1725
01:20:01,717 --> 01:20:05,543
was Bigby’s Hand
and try to grapple him.

1726
01:20:05,543 --> 01:20:09,393
MATT: Okay,
so you create Bigby’s Hand.

1727
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:11,931
SAM: (singing) Bigby's Hand!

1728
01:20:11,931 --> 01:20:13,332
MATT: And what level is Bigby’s Hand?

1729
01:20:13,332 --> 01:20:14,973
SAM: 5.
LAURA: Oh, no!

1730
01:20:14,973 --> 01:20:17,630
MATT: Bigby’s Hand (whoosh) appears
and rushes out,

1731
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:19,858
and the fingers
pass through the rakshasa.

1732
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,241
It has no effect.

1733
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:22,712
LAURA: I know, I know.
ASHLEY: No!

1734
01:20:22,712 --> 01:20:24,364
MATT: It twice more tries to reach out,

1735
01:20:24,364 --> 01:20:27,451
And the rakshasa shrugs it off
like it’s nothing.

1736
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:31,781
SAM: What? Bigby...
But the hand is still there?

1737
01:20:31,781 --> 01:20:33,488
SAM: He didn’t Counterspell it.
MATT: Correct.

1738
01:20:33,488 --> 01:20:36,957
SAM: He’s somehow immune
to hand-based attacks.

1739
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:41,302
What if it were a foot?
Would that have the same effect?

1740
01:20:41,306 --> 01:20:43,096
MATT: One could only conjecture.

1741
01:20:43,096 --> 01:20:44,752
SAM: Shit!

1742
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:46,379
TALIESIN: It’s just
the number of fingers, man.

1743
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:50,940
SAM: Well, then I flip him off with it,
but the British way.

1744
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:54,778
(all laugh)

1745
01:20:54,778 --> 01:20:58,639
MATT: Perfect.
All right, that’s going to end his turn.

1746
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,793
MATT: Scanlan, you’re up
LIAM: Rakshasa cannot be jerked.

1747
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:01,794
SAM: All right, I’m up.

1748
01:21:01,794 --> 01:21:05,749
Well, that didn’t work.
So I guess I’ll drop that.

1749
01:21:05,749 --> 01:21:11,318
And instead - 
Jesus, what else can he resist?

1750
01:21:11,318 --> 01:21:16,223
Fucking shit.

1751
01:21:16,223 --> 01:21:19,223
How far is he from me?

1752
01:21:19,223 --> 01:21:23,993
MATT: Currently? He’s about...
40 feet from you?

1753
01:21:23,993 --> 01:21:24,877
SAM: Okay.

1754
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:26,462
MATT: You can get up.
You’re still prone on the ground.

1755
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:29,027
SAM: I’ll use half of my movement
to get up,

1756
01:21:29,027 --> 01:21:35,613
and I will stare daggers at him
and cast Eyebite against him.

1757
01:21:35,613 --> 01:21:36,756
MATT: Okay.

1758
01:21:36,756 --> 01:21:41,113
SAM: Yeah, I’ll just do one of these

1759
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:44,173
and I'll sing at him. 
I'll sing,

1760
01:21:44,173 --> 01:21:50,339
"(singing) I hate rakasha,
so put another arrow in his body, baby!

1761
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:52,587
(others join in singing):
"I hate rakasha,

1762
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:55,918
"so come and take the time
and fight with me!"

1763
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:57,755
(all laugh)

1764
01:21:57,755 --> 01:21:58,990
MATT: As he looks back at you
as you’re singing out loud

1765
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,619
and chuckles to himself -

1766
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:01,926
SAM: Fucking -
MATT: - as it has no effect.

1767
01:22:01,926 --> 01:22:04,046
LIAM: Ah! Haha.
SAM: Fuck! But it was a good song!

1768
01:22:04,046 --> 01:22:05,717
TRAVIS: It was!
MATT: It was a very good song.

1769
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:07,940
LIAM: Petition to Chris Perkins
to rename it “rakasha.”

1770
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,617
MARISHA: Rakasha!
LAURA: (whispers) Rakasha!

1771
01:22:09,617 --> 01:22:13,038
SAM: But what, he’s impervious to spells?
How did that happen?

1772
01:22:13,038 --> 01:22:14,149
ASHLEY: What level was it?

1773
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:16,744
SAM: That’s a 6th-level spell!

1774
01:22:16,744 --> 01:22:17,982
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1775
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:21,617
MATT: You have two more squares,
if you want.

1776
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:25,849
SAM: I don’t have a sword anymore.
He picked it up, right?

1777
01:22:25,849 --> 01:22:26,825
LIAM: Yep.
MATT: Yep.

1778
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:30,222
SAM: So, I guess I will…
LIAM: Hey, I’m in a lot of pain.

1779
01:22:30,222 --> 01:22:31,980
SAM: Oh, yeah. That guy.

1780
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,350
(all laugh)

1781
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:39,455
SAM: Okay. I’ll, uh -
LIAM: 6 big hit points.

1782
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,879
SAM: I’ll heal you again with a -

1783
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:45,284
I can only do a level 1 bonus action
with a Healing Word, right?

1784
01:22:45,284 --> 01:22:46,616
MATT: Up to level 2.

1785
01:22:46,616 --> 01:22:48,961
SAM: Oh, then I’ll do
a level 2 Healing Word.

1786
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:50,463
MATT: So 2d4 + 5.

1787
01:22:50,463 --> 01:22:56,110
SAM: Ooh. 2d4 + 5 and 5?
Or 2d4 + 5?

1788
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:57,104
MATT: Just 5.

1789
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:59,157
SAM: Well, this is shitty.
It’s 9 points again.

1790
01:22:59,157 --> 01:23:00,047
LIAM: I’ll take it.

1791
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:01,586
MATT: It’s better than nothing.
LIAM: Yep.

1792
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:05,565
MATT: Better than nothing. All righty.
That ends Scanlan’s turn. Grog, you’re up.

1793
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:08,415
TRAVIS: Can I see them at all
from the roof?

1794
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:10,973
MATT: Yeah. You’ve gotten up
and you can see them all there.

1795
01:23:10,973 --> 01:23:12,978
Whatever this creature is,

1796
01:23:12,978 --> 01:23:15,573
is now in the distance,
trying to run back.

1797
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:17,689
TRAVIS: Sweet anus! Reason to jump!

1798
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:19,598
TRAVIS: And I jump off the roof
into the courtyard.

1799
01:23:19,598 --> 01:23:23,210
MATT: Okay, (landing thud) you leap
and it’s a very small step down (footstep)

1800
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:25,462
TRAVIS: But I make it look
like I landed really hard!

1801
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:26,581
MARISHA: Three-point landing!

1802
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:29,071
TRAVIS: Can I continue my movement
in his direction

1803
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,711
as far as I can go? 50 feet.

1804
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:34,047
MATT: 50. That’s as far as you can get.

1805
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:35,883
TRAVIS: Is he another 20 feet away?

1806
01:23:35,883 --> 01:23:37,399
MATT: About 20 feet from you, yeah.

1807
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:41,052
TRAVIS: Can I take my...

1808
01:23:41,052 --> 01:23:45,582
Can I attach the Blood Axe
to my Chain of Returning

1809
01:23:45,582 --> 01:23:47,597
and hurl it at the rakshasa?

1810
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:52,195
MATT: I’ll say yeah. You, being Grog,
for the most part,

1811
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,931
you don’t take your equipment
too far from you

1812
01:23:53,931 --> 01:23:55,811
because you’ve been
in uncomfortable situations.

1813
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:59,283
TRAVIS: Only in the house of lady favors
do I let my beans hang out when I sleep.

1814
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:01,656
MATT: Right. Fair enough.
You would have the chain on you, still.

1815
01:24:01,656 --> 01:24:03,043
ASHLEY: Franks and beans!

1816
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:04,991
LIAM: How do you get the beans
above the franks?

1817
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:07,175
MATT: You attach it, swish it, 
and throw the axe. Go ahead.

1818
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,689
TRAVIS: Reckless attack.
MATT: Okay.

1819
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:14,415
TRAVIS: Thank god.
Not much better. 17.

1820
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:17,526
MATT: 17. 17 does hit.
TRAVIS: Oh, yay!

1821
01:24:17,526 --> 01:24:19,281
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

1822
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:30,724
TRAVIS: 6! That’s 26
with 6 points of necrotic damage.

1823
01:24:30,724 --> 01:24:36,184
MATT: Nice!
(throwing sounds)

1824
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:38,809
The axe slams
into the tiger creature’s chest.

1825
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:44,305
"(growls, breathes heavily)
I’ll come back for all of you!"

1826
01:24:44,305 --> 01:24:46,979
Do you want to pull the blade back?

1827
01:24:46,979 --> 01:24:47,712
TRAVIS: Nope.

1828
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:48,873
MATT: All right.

1829
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:51,087
It’s on the ground next to him,
it’s not jammed into him -

1830
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,350
TRAVIS: Oh, then yeah, I’ll pull it back.

1831
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,654
MATT: Yeah, it’s not hard to pull back.
TRAVIS: Just (whoosh).

1832
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:56,640
MATT: Go ahead
and roll your athletics check.

1833
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,094
TRAVIS: What is it?

1834
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,627
MATT: You’re raging,
so you have advantage.

1835
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,720
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

1836
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,724
TRAVIS: Same number.
LAURA: (laughs)

1837
01:25:02,724 --> 01:25:05,417
MATT: Athletics.
TRAVIS: 11.

1838
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:10,285
MATT: You pull it back (vwoof)
and it streaks past you (shhh),

1839
01:25:10,285 --> 01:25:12,369
scatters across the ground
in the other direction.

1840
01:25:12,369 --> 01:25:14,718
You haven’t quite picked it up yet;
you’re going to have to try again.

1841
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:15,921
TRAVIS: Meant to do that.
MATT: Yep.

1842
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:17,458
ASHLEY: It’s 15.
SAM: Cool move.

1843
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:18,880
TRAVIS: Oh, it’s 15, sorry.

1844
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,684
MATT: 15?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1845
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:23,604
MATT: Then as you (shhh) pull it back -

1846
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:25,905
No, not this day, Blood Axe.
You’re mine.

1847
01:25:25,905 --> 01:25:29,341
(all laugh)

1848
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:31,312
MATT: All right.
That finishes your turn, Grog.

1849
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:32,552
Keyleth, you’re up.

1850
01:25:35,692 --> 01:25:38,794
MARISHA: I am going to...

1851
01:25:38,794 --> 01:25:42,284
move up, I guess.
My full movement.

1852
01:25:44,334 --> 01:25:45,872
MATT: About there.

1853
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:49,380
MARISHA: Okay, roughly how far away
is he from me now? The rakshasa?

1854
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:52,749
MATT: Eyeballing it right now,
from best you can tell,

1855
01:25:52,749 --> 01:25:54,899
he’s about 60-70 feet from you.

1856
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:59,699
MARISHA: All right. Okay. 60-70 feet.

1857
01:25:59,699 --> 01:26:04,251
First things first,
I’m going to cast Wall of Stone,

1858
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:10,265
and what I want to do
is make it a semi-circle,

1859
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:14,947
and wall him in with us.

1860
01:26:14,947 --> 01:26:17,119
MATT: A semi-circle and wall you guys in?

1861
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:18,471
MARISHA: Yeah, wall him in with us.

1862
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:21,861
I don’t want us to lose sight on him,
but I want to make it like a -

1863
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:26,264
TALIESIN: A cup.
MARISHA: A cup. Yeah.

1864
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,006
MATT: All righty. So like around there?

1865
01:26:29,006 --> 01:26:30,994
MARISHA: Yep. All the way...

1866
01:26:30,994 --> 01:26:33,434
MATT: How long can you make the wall?

1867
01:26:33,435 --> 01:26:35,236
MARISHA: How long can I make the wall?

1868
01:26:35,236 --> 01:26:38,256
I can make the wall...

1869
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:40,324
MATT: Vax, you’re on deck by the way.

1870
01:26:40,324 --> 01:26:45,818
MARISHA: I can do 10 by... sorry.

1871
01:26:45,818 --> 01:26:51,688
If it’s 3 inches thick,
I can do 10 foot by -

1872
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:53,410
TALIESIN: 10 by 20?

1873
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:58,690
MARISHA: 20-foot panels...
It doesn’t really specify right now.

1874
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,956
Is it supposed to be 10...

1875
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:05,476
Okay, right. Right.

1876
01:27:05,476 --> 01:27:08,915
So I think that’s about right.

1877
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:11,551
MATT: I will pull this up.

1878
01:27:11,551 --> 01:27:13,189
MARISHA: I don’t want it
to be super thick.

1879
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:14,703
TALIESIN: It’s not a very descriptive -

1880
01:27:14,703 --> 01:27:16,844
MARISHA: It’s not very descriptive.

1881
01:27:20,474 --> 01:27:23,215
MATT: Okay, 6-inch thick,
composed of 10 foot by 10 foot panels -

1882
01:27:23,215 --> 01:27:27,514
MARISHA: And when I do 3 inches thick,
I can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels -

1883
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:30,488
it says the same damn thing in the book.

1884
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:36,723
You create a span of 20-foot length...

1885
01:27:36,723 --> 01:27:39,163
MATT: We’ll say that that’s fine.

1886
01:27:39,163 --> 01:27:44,473
You do a 3-inch wall there, 10 feet high?

1887
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:45,981
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All righty.

1888
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:50,899
MARISHA: And now I’m going to
do a bonus action - see if this works.

1889
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:55,287
Okay, I have a 60-foot range here,

1890
01:27:55,287 --> 01:27:59,757
so I want to cast a Grasping Vine -

1891
01:27:59,757 --> 01:28:02,523
MATT: Grasping Vine is a 4th-level spell.

1892
01:28:02,523 --> 01:28:04,806
You can’t do it as a bonus action
the same turn you did another spell.

1893
01:28:04,806 --> 01:28:06,121
MARISHA: Fuck, that’s right.
Never mind.

1894
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:09,520
Then I’m going to
take a bonus action

1895
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,800
and Healing Word Vax.

1896
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,916
MATT: Okay.

1897
01:28:15,506 --> 01:28:20,537
MARISHA: 8 points.
How far away am I from Vax?

1898
01:28:20,537 --> 01:28:24,181
MATT: You’re about 25-30 feet.

1899
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:27,198
MARISHA: Okay, can I shout at him?
MATT: You may.

1900
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,182
MARISHA: Vax! Is that Hotis?

1901
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:32,516
LIAM: Yeah!

1902
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:36,292
MARISHA: Uh, holy shit!

1903
01:28:38,192 --> 01:28:39,730
LIAM: That’s what I said!

1904
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:42,356
MARISHA: That’s my turn.
MATT: And it’s your turn, Vax.

1905
01:28:42,356 --> 01:28:44,775
LIAM: Okay, and the first thing I do
is shout out,

1906
01:28:44,775 --> 01:28:48,106
"Blades! I think blades
are the best way to go here, folks!"

1907
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:50,084
And I’m going to run at him.

1908
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:53,227
MATT: All righty.

1909
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:56,059
LIAM: I think I should get there
with 12, no?

1910
01:28:56,059 --> 01:28:57,999
LAURA: No boots.
LIAM: Oh! No boots!

1911
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:04,074
LIAM: All right, I’ll use - fuck a duck.
I’ll use the bonus action to dash.

1912
01:29:04,074 --> 01:29:06,318
MATT: Okay, dash. (swoosh)
You’ll get right there.

1913
01:29:06,318 --> 01:29:08,764
Unless you want to hold back -

1914
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:11,445
LIAM: And I’m going to try
to grapple that fucking dick.

1915
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:12,610
MATT: Go for it.

1916
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:15,474
LAURA: Mmm, that’s good.
LIAM: 19.

1917
01:29:15,474 --> 01:29:19,522
LAURA: I’m going to grapple that dick
so good.

1918
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:21,983
ASHLEY: I’m going to grapple that dick!
TALIESIN: I’m going to grapple that dick.

1919
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:23,445
SAM: Grapple that dick.
MATT: He is grappled.

1920
01:29:23,445 --> 01:29:25,039
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: Grapple him, yeah!

1921
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:26,488
(all laugh)

1922
01:29:26,488 --> 01:29:29,239
LIAM: And before my turn ends,
I’m going to pull him in and say,

1923
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,771
"Fool me once, motherfucker."

1924
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:33,910
And whoever steps in steps in.

1925
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,448
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

1926
01:29:35,448 --> 01:29:41,349
This assassin is done -
no turns for them.

1927
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:47,616
He is being slowly torn apart by Trinket
against the stairs. Vex, you’re up.

1928
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:53,082
LAURA: Okay, I’m going to...
jeez, Louise.

1929
01:29:53,082 --> 01:29:58,124
I’m going to... fly down
and land on the ground as my move.

1930
01:29:58,124 --> 01:30:01,236
MATT: All righty.

1931
01:30:01,236 --> 01:30:05,007
LAURA: And I’m going to shoot him
with my Blazing Bowstring.

1932
01:30:05,007 --> 01:30:09,140
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: (singing) Blazing Bowstring!

1933
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:10,644
LAURA: 22!

1934
01:30:10,644 --> 01:30:12,398
MATT: That hits.

1935
01:30:12,398 --> 01:30:18,164
LAURA: All right. (mumbling) ...13…

1936
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:21,074
LIAM: (sighs) Girl…

1937
01:30:21,074 --> 01:30:22,686
LAURA: (mumbling) ...plus 8…
ASHLEY: Nice.

1938
01:30:22,686 --> 01:30:25,660
LAURA: Is 21! On the first attack.
MATT: 21 damage. All righty.

1939
01:30:25,675 --> 01:30:27,755
LAURA: And I get to use
the Blazing Bowstring again

1940
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:30,082
because I get it twice.

1941
01:30:30,082 --> 01:30:33,405
MATT: You do. Roll for the next attack.

1942
01:30:33,405 --> 01:30:34,817
LAURA: That is a 26.
MATT: That hits, yeah.

1943
01:30:40,187 --> 01:30:42,201
LAURA: 15 on the second.

1944
01:30:44,601 --> 01:30:45,976
ASHLEY: Bracers?

1945
01:30:45,976 --> 01:30:46,975
MATT: All righty...

1946
01:30:46,975 --> 01:30:51,704
LAURA: Ah! Shit, add 4 to that.
I’m sorry. I’m an asshole.

1947
01:30:51,704 --> 01:30:53,991
MATT: No, it’s all good.
TRAVIS: You said it.

1948
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:56,969
MATT: All righty, so (whoosh whoosh)
both arrows slam

1949
01:30:56,969 --> 01:30:58,421
(sound of flame catching)
burst of flame -

1950
01:30:58,421 --> 01:30:59,850
"(growls)"

1951
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:03,911
MATT: He’s now starting to look
even more rough and ragged.

1952
01:31:03,911 --> 01:31:05,951
The fire’s curling
up the side of the robe.

1953
01:31:05,951 --> 01:31:07,419
LAURA: And I yell,

1954
01:31:07,419 --> 01:31:08,957
"What’s a hotis?!"

1955
01:31:13,027 --> 01:31:14,935
MATT: All right. Pike, you’re up.

1956
01:31:14,935 --> 01:31:20,876
ASHLEY: Okay. I would like
to get to the window and jump out.

1957
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:22,681
MATT: The hole in the wall you mean?

1958
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:23,934
ASHLEY: The hole in the wall.

1959
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:27,009
I have my Celestial Shield.
I’m going to cast Featherfall on myself.

1960
01:31:27,009 --> 01:31:29,271
MATT: Okay, this actually is a climb up.
This isn’t a window.

1961
01:31:29,271 --> 01:31:31,815
This is an opening in the wall
that Keyleth made with Stone Shape.

1962
01:31:31,815 --> 01:31:34,277
MARISHA: I made a ramp with the rubble.
MATT: You’re actually stepping up.

1963
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:35,647
ASHLEY: She made a ramp,
so we don’t need to do it.

1964
01:31:35,647 --> 01:31:36,648
MATT: So you get up,

1965
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:40,267
and the farthest you can get this turn,
unless you want to go full movement -

1966
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:42,716
you’ll not be able to make it
all the way up the ramp

1967
01:31:42,716 --> 01:31:44,739
and still do something, so…

1968
01:31:44,739 --> 01:31:46,933
ASHLEY: Can I use my Sprinter’s Boots?

1969
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:48,801
MATT: You can, actually. Yes, you can.

1970
01:31:48,801 --> 01:31:51,703
ASHLEY: I’m still up on the ramp.
Can I still be hidden, then?

1971
01:31:51,703 --> 01:31:53,267
I’ll stay right there.

1972
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:55,144
MATT: Okay,
so you come out onto the roof

1973
01:31:55,144 --> 01:31:58,531
and you jump down about 5 feet,
and you’re on the roof, now,

1974
01:31:58,531 --> 01:32:01,449
the moonlight coming down,
a somewhat clouded, spotted sky.

1975
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:04,305
In the distance, you see everyone
rushing towards some sort of entity

1976
01:32:04,305 --> 01:32:09,272
that’s walled in by a stone wall.
He’s currently up in the face of Vax.

1977
01:32:09,272 --> 01:32:11,770
You still have your action right now.

1978
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:17,289
ASHLEY: Okay. Do I have a clear shot

1979
01:32:17,289 --> 01:32:23,799
to use - where did it go?

1980
01:32:23,799 --> 01:32:27,209
ASHLEY: Flame Strike at 7th level.
MATT: You do, actually.

1981
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:31,354
MATT: You do. On 7th level?

1982
01:32:31,354 --> 01:32:32,813
ASHLEY: Da.

1983
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:37,557
SAM: Our music, it’s gone.
LAURA: Oh no.

1984
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:39,376
MATT: Oh, it’s coming, don’t worry.

1985
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:42,564
LIAM: (singing "Whistle Stop")

1986
01:32:42,564 --> 01:32:48,930
(all join in on different parts)
SAM: That’s also Bluegrass, folks.

1987
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,874
MATT: And with that,
we’re putting box music up.

1988
01:32:52,874 --> 01:32:55,526
(all chuckle)

1989
01:32:55,526 --> 01:32:57,913
MATT: Or we should be.
LAURA: Oh no!

1990
01:32:57,913 --> 01:32:59,615
TALIESIN: (radio announcer voice)
That’s called "The Rakshasa Blues."

1991
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:03,157
TALIESIN: Coming up next -
LIAM: (starts singing Mortal Kombat theme)

1992
01:33:03,157 --> 01:33:04,633
MATT: We’ve got a boombox right here -

1993
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:06,263
LAURA, MARISHA, AND ASHLEY:
Mortal Kombat!

1994
01:33:06,263 --> 01:33:08,223
TRAVIS: Doo-doo-doo. Fight!

1995
01:33:08,223 --> 01:33:09,637
MATT: I don’t know why -
input’s functional,

1996
01:33:09,637 --> 01:33:11,051
but we’ll just make up the music as we go.

1997
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:16,504
So, at a 7th-level Flame Strike.
That’ll be putting... 10d6 damage.

1998
01:33:16,504 --> 01:33:18,362
Going to attempt a saving throw.

1999
01:33:18,362 --> 01:33:19,611
That’s a natural 1,

2000
01:33:19,611 --> 01:33:22,755
but does have advantage
on saving throws against spells.

2001
01:33:22,755 --> 01:33:24,898
LAURA: I can hear music,
it’s just really quiet!

2002
01:33:24,898 --> 01:33:28,387
MARISHA: Yeah, I can hear it.
LIAM: I liked ours better.

2003
01:33:28,387 --> 01:33:30,427
MARISHA: Oh, there we go!
Oh, you were doing something to it.

2004
01:33:30,427 --> 01:33:32,499
SAM: This is exciting.
MATT: It’s coming, isn’t it?

2005
01:33:32,499 --> 01:33:34,441
MARISHA: It’s coming.
LIAM: (record scratching noise)

2006
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:38,122
MATT: What’s the DC of your spell?
That’ll be an 18.

2007
01:33:38,122 --> 01:33:39,287
MATT: Spell DC?

2008
01:33:39,287 --> 01:33:40,445
ASHLEY: 18.

2009
01:33:40,445 --> 01:33:42,149
MATT: Yeah, it does save,
so it takes half damage.

2010
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,987
Go ahead and roll 10d6.

2011
01:33:43,987 --> 01:33:47,056
LAURA: Damn.
LIAM: Damn.

2012
01:33:47,056 --> 01:33:51,126
ASHLEY: Okay, 6, 8, 9.

2013
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,491
MARISHA: Kill that motherfucker!

2014
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:57,181
ASHLEY: 14.
LAURA: 18.

2015
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:59,945
ASHLEY: 18.
TRAVIS: (whispers) 19.

2016
01:33:59,945 --> 01:34:05,289
ASHLEY: 19, 22 -
TRAVIS: But that’s it -

2017
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:06,758
ASHLEY: I roll 10.
TRAVIS: Oh!

2018
01:34:06,758 --> 01:34:11,756
LAURA: 22, 28, 29.

2019
01:34:11,756 --> 01:34:13,516
LIAM: It’s like watching the Olympics.

2020
01:34:13,516 --> 01:34:14,937
ASHLEY: 29.

2021
01:34:14,937 --> 01:34:18,312
LIAM: 5-9, 5-8, 6-1.
LAURA: Ooh!

2022
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:21,758
MARISHA: I don’t even know
what that means!

2023
01:34:21,758 --> 01:34:23,905
ASHLEY: Okay, so 45.

2024
01:34:23,905 --> 01:34:29,105
MATT: So, 45 halved is 22 points
of fire and bludgeoning damage.

2025
01:34:29,105 --> 01:34:30,493
MARISHA: What did you cast?

2026
01:34:30,493 --> 01:34:32,402
MATT: So how do you want to do this?

2027
01:34:32,402 --> 01:34:33,830
ASHLEY: (gasps) Wha -
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Oh!

2028
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:35,323
TRAVIS: Shit!
LAURA: Oh my god!

2029
01:34:35,323 --> 01:34:39,519
ASHLEY: Are you serious? (gasps) What?

2030
01:34:39,519 --> 01:34:42,119
LAURA: Pikey-Pike killed a rakshasa!

2031
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:44,736
MATT: How do you want to do this?
LIAM: Do it, girl.

2032
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,962
ASHLEY: I’m so shocked! I don’t know!

2033
01:34:46,962 --> 01:34:51,060
Okay, okay. Oh, man.

2034
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:54,060
Can the Flame Strike go through his body

2035
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,770
and (explosion noise)
burst him like a (foof)?

2036
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,256
(all laugh)

2037
01:35:00,256 --> 01:35:01,854
MATT: Burst him like a foof.

2038
01:35:01,854 --> 01:35:03,650
So, as you turn the corner,

2039
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,275
seeing all your friends
charging toward this creature,

2040
01:35:06,275 --> 01:35:09,712
knowing the fear that you heard
in Vax’s voice earlier,

2041
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:12,424
the burning rage of vengeance -

2042
01:35:12,424 --> 01:35:13,348
ASHLEY: I’m mad.

2043
01:35:13,348 --> 01:35:16,163
MATT: - burns beneath your skin -
SAM: Exposed skin.

2044
01:35:16,163 --> 01:35:19,782
MATT: - your mostly exposed skin.
ASHLEY: My non-hairy skin.

2045
01:35:19,782 --> 01:35:21,084
(all laugh)

2046
01:35:21,084 --> 01:35:23,689
MATT: You grab your holy symbol,
drop the shield,

2047
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:26,672
and bring your arm up like this.

2048
01:35:26,672 --> 01:35:30,896
As you do, the rakshasa before you
all of a sudden goes like (grunts) -

2049
01:35:30,896 --> 01:35:33,729
LIAM: I’m going to let go of him now.
MATT: You see the skin cracking -

2050
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:35,647
LIAM: Just back up a few.

2051
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:40,130
MATT: - these breaks to his exterior,

2052
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:43,187
these strange, glowing,
internal cracks on his body.

2053
01:35:43,187 --> 01:35:49,977
"(hissing, raspy breaths)
I will return!"

2054
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,974
LIAM: Yeah, we’ll see you next time,
shitface.

2055
01:35:51,974 --> 01:35:54,891
MATT: (explosion sound)
And he detonates with a column of fire

2056
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:57,061
that comes bursting out of the ground
from the body.

2057
01:35:57,061 --> 01:35:59,944
You can see the shattering,
burned bits of rakshasa flesh

2058
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:03,292
go flying across
the entire exterior of the castle

2059
01:36:03,292 --> 01:36:08,391
as this column, 20, 30, 40 feet up,
streaks up out of the top of the castle,

2060
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:11,497
lighting up
the vicinity of Whitestone.

2061
01:36:11,497 --> 01:36:14,683
And as it slowly subsides,

2062
01:36:14,683 --> 01:36:18,033
there is nothing but a pile of ash
left where Hotis was.

2063
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:21,800
(cheers)

2064
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,581
TRAVIS: That was sweet!
LAURA: What the fuck was that?

2065
01:36:24,581 --> 01:36:25,758
ASHLEY: Thanks, Grog!

2066
01:36:25,758 --> 01:36:27,265
SAM: So, I think I understand.

2067
01:36:27,265 --> 01:36:29,603
You have to be naked
to cast spells on it. Is that it?

2068
01:36:29,603 --> 01:36:31,290
ASHLEY: I think that’s what it is!

2069
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,711
LIAM: That’s how we did it last time.

2070
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:35,184
LAURA: What was that? What is this?

2071
01:36:35,184 --> 01:36:38,136
TALIESIN: I’m going to
finish running up to the West Tower.

2072
01:36:38,136 --> 01:36:41,140
LAURA: Trinket is slowly realizing
nobody’s around him.

2073
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:45,015
TALIESIN: He could have joined me.
ASHLEY: I hold my shield over my body.

2074
01:36:45,015 --> 01:36:49,998
LIAM: I think we might need to have
a discussion with Vanessa at some point

2075
01:36:49,998 --> 01:36:52,660
for not alerting us
to the fact that this is a -

2076
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:55,075
MARISHA: That those things come back.
LIAM: - an ongoing -

2077
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:57,214
MARISHA: - problem.
LIAM: - contract.

2078
01:36:57,214 --> 01:36:59,354
TRAVIS: I run over
and I give Pike a fancy robe.

2079
01:36:59,354 --> 01:37:01,396
MARISHA: We watched him die.

2080
01:37:01,396 --> 01:37:04,398
LAURA: Who, Hotis?

2081
01:37:04,398 --> 01:37:07,045
LIAM: I stuck a knife through his throat
and slit the front of it.

2082
01:37:07,045 --> 01:37:08,578
TRAVIS: You killed him before?

2083
01:37:08,578 --> 01:37:09,929
ASHLEY: So he comes back?

2084
01:37:09,929 --> 01:37:12,027
MARISHA: Remember when we split up
for the Slayer’s Take?

2085
01:37:12,027 --> 01:37:13,760
He was our contract.

2086
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,576
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Right.

2087
01:37:15,576 --> 01:37:17,539
TRAVIS: Didn’t finish him off, did you?

2088
01:37:17,539 --> 01:37:20,313
MARISHA: Nope,
Vax and I watched him die.

2089
01:37:20,313 --> 01:37:25,566
TRAVIS: Like, die, or like he “ah” fell?
LAURA: And then you walked away.

2090
01:37:25,566 --> 01:37:28,023
LIAM: I slit his throat.
MARISHA: He slit his throat.

2091
01:37:28,023 --> 01:37:29,562
LIAM: And it exploded blood

2092
01:37:29,562 --> 01:37:32,234
all over the ground
underneath his big smile -

2093
01:37:32,234 --> 01:37:34,218
MARISHA: Yes, it got blood
all over the place.

2094
01:37:34,218 --> 01:37:36,208
TRAVIS: That’s pretty dead.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2095
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,039
TRAVIS: So he’s a vampire.

2096
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:41,873
MARISHA: I think we need
to talk to Vanessa, like he said.

2097
01:37:41,873 --> 01:37:43,800
TALIESIN: I am alerting the guards

2098
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,649
and I am yelling through the hallways
to lock down the city.

2099
01:37:46,649 --> 01:37:49,660
MATT: Which, at this point,
guards start coming up from below -

2100
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,782
LAURA: Good job, guys! Totally on it.

2101
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:54,815
TALIESIN: We don’t know we got everybody -
lock down, keep looking!

2102
01:37:54,815 --> 01:37:57,834
MARISHA: Yes, be that there are
assassins running around,

2103
01:37:57,834 --> 01:37:59,580
which was not part of the contract before.

2104
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,117
LAURA: I fly up on the broom

2105
01:38:01,117 --> 01:38:05,429
and try to spot anybody on the ground
that looks dangerous.

2106
01:38:05,429 --> 01:38:07,687
TRAVIS: Can I look at Vax
and ask him what he’s wearing?

2107
01:38:07,687 --> 01:38:10,356
LAURA: (laughs)
LIAM: Oh, this is a -

2108
01:38:10,356 --> 01:38:12,982
SAM: A bloody robe.
LIAM: A beautiful, bloodied...

2109
01:38:12,982 --> 01:38:15,117
LIAM: It’s a robe.
It’s a beautiful brown.

2110
01:38:15,117 --> 01:38:18,109
MARISHA: The beading on it is gorgeous.
LAURA: I thought it was silver.

2111
01:38:18,109 --> 01:38:19,086
ASHLEY: Can I check the robe?

2112
01:38:19,086 --> 01:38:21,457
LIAM: No, no look at it - it’s brown.
It’s brown, it’s earthy.

2113
01:38:21,457 --> 01:38:23,800
LAURA: Matt said it was silver
the last game.

2114
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,453
LIAM: Yeah, but look at it. 
Can’t you see with your eyes? It's brown.

2115
01:38:26,453 --> 01:38:30,550
MATT: Well, portions of it are brown now,
due to the blood that has seeped into it

2116
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:32,936
from the various stab wounds
that he’s suffered.

2117
01:38:32,936 --> 01:38:34,915
LIAM: I don’t really want to wear this.

2118
01:38:34,915 --> 01:38:36,917
I’m a little confused right now.
I think I need to -

2119
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:39,563
SAM: What happened?
TRAVIS: Yeah, how did that happen?

2120
01:38:39,563 --> 01:38:41,353
ASHLEY: Can I take a look at the robe?

2121
01:38:41,353 --> 01:38:43,225
MATT: As you attempt to take the robe off,

2122
01:38:43,225 --> 01:38:46,962
you feel like the strength
is sapped from your body

2123
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,177
and you’re like (raspy groan).

2124
01:38:49,177 --> 01:38:51,681
And the more you try to pull it off,
the more and more you start to feel

2125
01:38:51,681 --> 01:38:53,864
like it’s pulling the breath
out of your lungs.

2126
01:38:53,864 --> 01:38:55,935
ASHLEY: Can I try to rip it off of him?

2127
01:38:55,935 --> 01:38:58,920
LIAM: Ah, wait wait wait wait wait -
let’s figure out what’s going on!

2128
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,358
LAURA: Do I see anything? Can I land?

2129
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:03,498
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check -

2130
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:06,028
LIAM: Wait, stop, everyone stop.
(breathes heavily)

2131
01:39:06,028 --> 01:39:09,377
That thing came to me
disguised as Gilmore.

2132
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:12,761
He told me he wanted to talk,
we went for a walk, he gave me this -

2133
01:39:12,761 --> 01:39:16,662
Full disclosure,
we all know he’s fucking sweet on me.

2134
01:39:16,662 --> 01:39:19,687
We went for a stroll
and then he turned into whatever he is

2135
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,745
and then
he fucking stabbed me in the gut.

2136
01:39:21,745 --> 01:39:23,860
ASHLEY: Wait, but -

2137
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:25,924
MATT: You see guards
scattered around the castle.

2138
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:27,740
ASHLEY: Gilmore gave you the robe?

2139
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:32,569
LIAM: No, he was disguised as Gilmore.
MARISHA: The rakshasa can disguise -

2140
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:35,459
LIAM: He’s a skinchanger.
MARISHA: He can shape-shift -

2141
01:39:35,459 --> 01:39:38,170
MARISHA: - and he can teleport,
and he can do all sorts of shifty things.

2142
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:43,311
LIAM: Which means we need to find Gilmore
and we need to find Allura now.

2143
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:45,981
TALIESIN: Everyone get -
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on!

2144
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,427
MARISHA: I go up to Vax

2145
01:39:47,427 --> 01:39:51,646
and I cast Dispel Magic
as I try and pull off the robe.

2146
01:39:51,646 --> 01:39:53,040
MATT: Okay.

2147
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,051
LIAM: Ahh. Ahh?

2148
01:39:56,051 --> 01:39:59,534
It stings? I think.

2149
01:40:02,784 --> 01:40:07,353
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20

2150
01:40:07,353 --> 01:40:13,633
and add 6 for your wisdom.

2151
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:15,278
MARISHA: Add 6 to my wisdom?

2152
01:40:15,278 --> 01:40:16,980
MATT: Add 6 to the roll from your wisdom.

2153
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,983
MARISHA: Oh, add 6 to the roll
from my wisdom.

2154
01:40:19,983 --> 01:40:23,081
Oh, adding my modifier, right. 14.

2155
01:40:23,081 --> 01:40:26,304
MATT: 14. As you cast Dispel Magic
and start pulling the robe back,

2156
01:40:26,304 --> 01:40:30,284
you feel like someone’s
pulling the skin off your body.

2157
01:40:30,284 --> 01:40:32,217
SAM: Oh, god.
LIAM: Fuck me!

2158
01:40:32,217 --> 01:40:34,422
MATT: You suffer 12 points of damage

2159
01:40:34,422 --> 01:40:38,175
as it feels like someone’s
peeling the flesh off your body.

2160
01:40:38,175 --> 01:40:39,825
SAM AND MARISHA: Wait, does it come off?

2161
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:40,575
MATT: No.

2162
01:40:40,575 --> 01:40:42,445
TALIESIN: I've got a plan.
MARISHA: It doesn't come off.

2163
01:40:42,445 --> 01:40:43,612
TRAVIS: I pull it off.

2164
01:40:43,612 --> 01:40:45,040
TALIESIN: No no no no no! No.

2165
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,713
I’m grabbing Vex.

2166
01:40:46,713 --> 01:40:50,902
Vax, Vex, with me.
Everyone start searching.

2167
01:40:50,902 --> 01:40:53,143
Tell them that we’re going to need
a healer downstairs.

2168
01:40:53,143 --> 01:40:55,196
And I’m going to take him.
We’re going to head towards -

2169
01:40:55,196 --> 01:40:57,399
LAURA: Wait, did you say me or him?
TALIESIN: I’m taking both of you -

2170
01:40:57,399 --> 01:40:59,489
TALIESIN: - because I’m not 
carrying him alone, because he’s heavy.

2171
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:02,212
LAURA: He’s actually quite light.
LIAM: I’m lighter than my sister.

2172
01:41:02,212 --> 01:41:05,182
TALIESIN: I have a strength of 12.
There’s not a lot I can do.

2173
01:41:05,182 --> 01:41:08,155
LAURA: Ow, no, I'm serious. Don't! 
I'm really not strong.

2174
01:41:08,155 --> 01:41:13,211
TALIESIN: I’m going to try and drag him
down towards the pit

2175
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:17,173
with the orb of death.

2176
01:41:17,173 --> 01:41:19,186
MARISHA: Oh, that’s a good idea.

2177
01:41:19,186 --> 01:41:22,838
TRAVIS: Are there any pieces
of the rakshasa left?

2178
01:41:22,838 --> 01:41:26,338
MATT: Burned, tiny chunks and ash.

2179
01:41:26,338 --> 01:41:28,908
It was a full - it was -

2180
01:41:28,908 --> 01:41:33,178
We’re talking end-of-Matrix-style
Agent Smith scattering.

2181
01:41:33,178 --> 01:41:35,493
LIAM: Scanlan!
SAM: What?

2182
01:41:35,493 --> 01:41:37,309
LIAM: Will you grab
that dagger off the ground for me?

2183
01:41:37,309 --> 01:41:38,988
SAM: What dagger? You had a -

2184
01:41:38,988 --> 01:41:40,686
LIAM: His dagger, the dagger -
no, I’ve got your sword.

2185
01:41:40,686 --> 01:41:43,067
And I toss it as we get dragged off.

2186
01:41:43,067 --> 01:41:44,589
The dagger. Get the dagger for me!

2187
01:41:44,589 --> 01:41:45,790
SAM: I’ll grab the dagger.
I’m coming with.

2188
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:46,814
LIAM: I like them.

2189
01:41:46,814 --> 01:41:48,789
MARISHA: I go and I look
for Allura and Gilmore.

2190
01:41:48,789 --> 01:41:51,064
TALIESIN: Yes, let them know
what’s going on.

2191
01:41:51,064 --> 01:41:52,408
MARISHA: While they do that.

2192
01:41:52,408 --> 01:41:56,227
MATT: Okay. So you take Vax and Vex
down towards the ziggurat.

2193
01:41:56,227 --> 01:41:57,587
LAURA: Come on.
LIAM: (groans)

2194
01:41:57,587 --> 01:41:58,777
TALIESIN: Just make sure

2195
01:41:58,777 --> 01:42:00,572
if you start to feel strange
as we go down there, let us know.

2196
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:03,495
And we slowly inch
towards the effects of it.

2197
01:42:03,495 --> 01:42:05,387
LIAM: This is why
I didn’t even bother to take it off.

2198
01:42:05,387 --> 01:42:08,018
LAURA: You know what? At least 
it doesn’t smell as bad as your feathers.

2199
01:42:08,018 --> 01:42:09,359
TALIESIN: That’s so true.

2200
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:11,412
ASHLEY: I’d like to follow.
MATT: Okay.

2201
01:42:11,412 --> 01:42:13,384
LIAM: Life’s not that bad.
Life’s not that bad.

2202
01:42:13,384 --> 01:42:14,478
TALIESIN: Yes, but your smell is.

2203
01:42:14,478 --> 01:42:17,255
TRAVIS: I’ll go, too, just as security.
SAM: I’m with.

2204
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:18,926
MATT: You’re with them?
SAM: Yes.

2205
01:42:18,926 --> 01:42:20,617
MATT: All right, so you guys
all make your way down.

2206
01:42:20,617 --> 01:42:23,065
As you’re going through the castle,
it’s in utter chaos now.

2207
01:42:23,065 --> 01:42:29,001
All the guards who, in what was 
about 20 to 30 seconds of action

2208
01:42:29,001 --> 01:42:31,728
since the moment of actual shouting
at the top of the tower,

2209
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:35,005
the reaction time would be great

2210
01:42:35,005 --> 01:42:38,423
if it wasn’t such a short window
they had to get up there

2211
01:42:38,423 --> 01:42:40,127
and you guys
were right in the thick of it,

2212
01:42:40,127 --> 01:42:41,367
and more trained than these soldiers.

2213
01:42:41,367 --> 01:42:43,183
MARISHA: As I’m looking
for Gilmore and Allura,

2214
01:42:43,183 --> 01:42:48,574
I’m alerting the guards
of the visuals of the assailants.

2215
01:42:48,574 --> 01:42:52,004
MATT: Okay. And the guards
begin to continue pushing around.

2216
01:42:52,004 --> 01:42:53,120
You can see now,

2217
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,111
lights are starting to come on
in the town.

2218
01:42:55,111 --> 01:42:56,835
You guys make your way down

2219
01:42:56,835 --> 01:43:01,628
into the subterranean tunnels
under Whitestone, where the Ziggurat is.

2220
01:43:01,628 --> 01:43:05,565
You can see it, once again,
the large, pyramid-like structure.

2221
01:43:05,565 --> 01:43:11,083
TALIESIN: I cast - no, no, never mind.
I’ll hold off. Keep walking.

2222
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:13,468
MATT: Okay. You make your way
into the central chamber.

2223
01:43:13,468 --> 01:43:20,050
It has a number of fire-based braziers
that are set in there now for light

2224
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,187
that are just general fire,

2225
01:43:22,187 --> 01:43:23,899
but a lot of them
are burned down to embers.

2226
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:27,471
It’s very, very low light in this area.
You can barely see anything in here.

2227
01:43:27,471 --> 01:43:30,454
You guys make your way inside the room.

2228
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:35,221
It’s cold, it’s dank,
it’s not a very comfortable atmosphere.

2229
01:43:35,221 --> 01:43:37,441
TALIESIN: Okay. Very gently.

2230
01:43:37,441 --> 01:43:39,181
LIAM: I’ll do it! I’ll do it.

2231
01:43:39,181 --> 01:43:41,622
TALIESIN: If this doesn’t work,
we can try something else.

2232
01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:43,564
TRAVIS: What are you doing?
LAURA: I’ve got it.

2233
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:46,903
SAM: Hold on, we’re close enough
that magic has no effect, yeah?

2234
01:43:46,903 --> 01:43:48,384
LAURA: Potentially.
LIAM: Potentially.

2235
01:43:48,384 --> 01:43:51,200
SAM: I’ll cast Mage Hand
to slap Percy in the face.

2236
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,486
MATT: No effect.
SAM: No effect.

2237
01:43:53,486 --> 01:43:54,896
SAM: Okay, we’re good.
LIAM: All right.

2238
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:57,128
LIAM: I’m going to just peel it, slowly.

2239
01:43:57,128 --> 01:43:59,579
I’m not going to rip it off
like these assholes.

2240
01:43:59,579 --> 01:44:00,882
MATT: Okay.
It pulls back with no issue.

2241
01:44:00,882 --> 01:44:02,830
LAURA: Hey! Get that shit off.

2242
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:05,470
SAM: Throw it in the orb!
TALIESIN: Don’t throw it in the orb!

2243
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:07,390
LAURA: Somebody give him
something to put on.

2244
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:09,112
Grog, do you have
any more fancy robes?

2245
01:44:09,112 --> 01:44:10,743
TRAVIS: Nope, all out.

2246
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:12,804
TALIESIN: Put it on the ground.
We’ll deal with it.

2247
01:44:12,804 --> 01:44:14,515
We’re not leaving it here.

2248
01:44:14,515 --> 01:44:16,880
LAURA: Well, just cover up your bits
with it, maybe.

2249
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,806
LIAM: We look
almost exactly the same -

2250
01:44:21,806 --> 01:44:24,066
LAURA: I don’t have any dangly bits,
I’m sorry to tell you.

2251
01:44:24,066 --> 01:44:27,963
LIAM: Minus that one thing,
we are so close.

2252
01:44:27,963 --> 01:44:30,603
TALIESIN: Three things. Three things.
MARISHA: Three things. There’s a few.

2253
01:44:30,603 --> 01:44:32,237
LAURA: A couple other things.
LIAM: Yeah, but still.

2254
01:44:32,237 --> 01:44:34,475
TRAVIS: I do have one other fancy robe.

2255
01:44:34,475 --> 01:44:37,265
LAURA: Give him a fancy robe, Grog.
TRAVIS: Mmm.

2256
01:44:37,265 --> 01:44:38,631
LAURA: Grog!

2257
01:44:38,631 --> 01:44:39,652
TRAVIS: Yes?

2258
01:44:39,652 --> 01:44:41,191
LAURA: For my sake?

2259
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,674
TRAVIS: All right.
Last fancy robe to Vax.

2260
01:44:43,674 --> 01:44:45,480
SAM: Will the Bag of Holding
work down here?

2261
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:47,893
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: Shush, you fucker.

2262
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:49,655
LAURA: Oh, shit.

2263
01:44:49,655 --> 01:44:52,771
MATT: You reach into the Bag of Holding,
and it’s just an empty satchel.

2264
01:44:52,771 --> 01:44:55,339
TALIESIN: Yeah,
there’s no Bag of Holding in here.

2265
01:44:55,339 --> 01:44:58,372
So why don’t we go upstairs
now that it’s off

2266
01:44:58,372 --> 01:45:01,542
and we’ll leave it here,
and I’ll be the last to leave with it.

2267
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:04,655
LAURA: Wait.
Why are you keeping it, Percy?

2268
01:45:04,655 --> 01:45:08,769
TALIESIN: Because I'm not sure
destroying it in here is the best idea,

2269
01:45:08,769 --> 01:45:12,542
and I'm not sure if destroying it
is going to damage him.

2270
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:15,077
TALIESIN: So we're going to be careful.
LAURA: All right.

2271
01:45:15,077 --> 01:45:17,365
TRAVIS: Aren't there acid pools down here?
LAURA: No.

2272
01:45:17,365 --> 01:45:19,405
TALIESIN: It's not a terrible idea,
but we should -

2273
01:45:19,405 --> 01:45:20,508
TRAVIS: Yeah, there are.

2274
01:45:20,508 --> 01:45:23,085
LAURA: Oh. That's right,
that's where your gun went.

2275
01:45:23,085 --> 01:45:25,293
LIAM: But not near here, not here.

2276
01:45:25,293 --> 01:45:29,780
TALIESIN: Let's just very gently -
we don't know what that is yet,

2277
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:34,566
so let's very gently
get you out of the orb's influence,

2278
01:45:34,566 --> 01:45:36,706
and then we'll remove it
out of the orb's influence,

2279
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:38,179
and we'll see if there's a problem.

2280
01:45:38,179 --> 01:45:40,708
LIAM: I walk proudly and naked
out of the fucking ziggurat.

2281
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:42,440
TRAVIS: That's what I was going to ask.

2282
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,926
MATT: All right.

2283
01:45:43,926 --> 01:45:45,461
TALIESIN: I pick up the cloak

2284
01:45:45,461 --> 01:45:49,250
and move it outside the orb's influence
to see if it has any effect.

2285
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,783
MATT: Okay.

2286
01:45:50,783 --> 01:45:56,926
As you pull it beyond the perimeter
of what you've come to mark,

2287
01:45:56,926 --> 01:45:58,192
and it is marked, by the way.

2288
01:45:58,192 --> 01:45:59,893
Through the research of Allura

2289
01:45:59,893 --> 01:46:00,913
and the folks
that have been here for a while,

2290
01:46:00,913 --> 01:46:04,493
there is a specific mark in the hallway
where that barrier begins.

2291
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:07,702
TALIESIN: I just gingerly
start to put it forward, watching him.

2292
01:46:07,702 --> 01:46:10,439
MATT: No noticeable effect.
TALIESIN: All right.

2293
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:12,787
LAURA: Nothing?
TALIESIN: Seems all right.

2294
01:46:12,787 --> 01:46:14,638
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly walk
away from the -

2295
01:46:14,638 --> 01:46:16,845
slowly bring it
out of the influence of the sphere.

2296
01:46:16,845 --> 01:46:17,654
MATT: No effect.

2297
01:46:17,654 --> 01:46:19,459
LAURA: Does that mean
we should take it back in and chop it up

2298
01:46:19,459 --> 01:46:20,948
so nobody ever puts it on?

2299
01:46:20,948 --> 01:46:23,508
TALIESIN: I think we should
have someone look at it first.

2300
01:46:23,508 --> 01:46:25,457
SAM: No, we can use it as a weapon.

2301
01:46:25,457 --> 01:46:27,870
TALIESIN: Or we could destroy it properly.
One or the other.

2302
01:46:27,870 --> 01:46:30,452
TRAVIS: Probably a good idea.
Should I check the Bag of Holding now?

2303
01:46:30,452 --> 01:46:33,321
LAURA: Yeah, look in it.
TRAVIS: Can I reach in for a fancy robe?

2304
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:35,288
MATT: Yeah, you pull out a fancy robe.

2305
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:38,661
TRAVIS: Awesome. I wind it up like a towel
and I smack Vax on the ass super hard.

2306
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:40,388
LIAM: What's - fucking hell.
And I don't even roll for it.

2307
01:46:40,388 --> 01:46:41,899
(screams)

2308
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:45,130
TRAVIS: Bare ass. Bare ass
I get it really good, like (whack)!

2309
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:46,695
LIAM: Grog. Grog.
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2310
01:46:46,695 --> 01:46:48,758
LIAM: Brother,
I am so happy to be alive.

2311
01:46:48,758 --> 01:46:50,747
TRAVIS: Yeah, me, too.
Here you go. (whssht)

2312
01:46:50,747 --> 01:46:52,766
LIAM: Whoo.
Wait, is this the one? Ugh.

2313
01:46:52,766 --> 01:46:55,503
LAURA: No, no, it's a fancy robe.
It's just a regular robe.

2314
01:46:55,503 --> 01:46:57,301
LIAM: Are you sure?
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Yes.

2315
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:59,897
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it on, fucker.
MATT: (laughs)

2316
01:46:59,897 --> 01:47:03,677
MATT: The fear of robes has now set in.
MARISHA: (laughs) In robes?

2317
01:47:03,677 --> 01:47:06,728
TALIESIN: I am carrying the robe
on Bad News

2318
01:47:06,728 --> 01:47:09,436
like a stank rag, at this point,
through the hallway.

2319
01:47:09,436 --> 01:47:11,840
MATT: Okay. While this is happening,
you make your way down.

2320
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,327
Allura and Gilmore weren't staying
in the castle.

2321
01:47:15,327 --> 01:47:17,659
They were staying
on the north side of the town.

2322
01:47:17,659 --> 01:47:24,238
MARISHA: As I walk towards them,
I want to throw up a Skywrite, once again.

2323
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:27,702
The de Rolo crest, just alerting people.

2324
01:47:27,702 --> 01:47:30,094
MATT: Okay. And you do see,
there are lights coming on in the town

2325
01:47:30,094 --> 01:47:33,213
and guards are now going out
through the streets,

2326
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:35,334
going through buildings,

2327
01:47:35,334 --> 01:47:37,580
searching for individuals
that match the description you're at.

2328
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:41,224
As you make your way
towards Gilmore's home,

2329
01:47:41,224 --> 01:47:44,618
you hear what sounds like
a loud, heavy thud.

2330
01:47:44,618 --> 01:47:49,789
(boof) (boof boof) Another one,
and suddenly a crash of glass.

2331
01:47:49,789 --> 01:47:51,952
LAURA: I take off run -
oh, she's by herself.

2332
01:47:51,952 --> 01:47:53,805
MATT: She's there by herself.

2333
01:47:53,805 --> 01:47:56,110
MARISHA: Okay.

2334
01:47:56,110 --> 01:48:00,984
I'm going to cast Polymorph on myself.

2335
01:48:00,984 --> 01:48:01,853
MATT: Okay.

2336
01:48:01,853 --> 01:48:05,572
MARISHA: And I'm going to go as a mouse.

2337
01:48:05,572 --> 01:48:07,710
MATT: Wild Shape or Polymorph?

2338
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:08,687
MARISHA: Polymorph.

2339
01:48:08,687 --> 01:48:12,385
MATT: Okay. (fft)
You turn into a tiny little mouse.

2340
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:15,538
MARISHA: Can I fit through the door?

2341
01:48:15,538 --> 01:48:18,360
MATT: Yep. You (fft) skirt under the door.

2342
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:24,370
The first thing you notice now
is there is a bookcase that is shattered

2343
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:30,621
and there is a figure slumped
in the corner where the table is broken.

2344
01:48:30,621 --> 01:48:35,917
There's a little bit of light
from a lantern that's been knocked over

2345
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:37,900
that's starting to catch fire
on the curtains,

2346
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:40,511
and as the light (whoosh)
from the flames begin to pick up,

2347
01:48:40,511 --> 01:48:42,444
you can see the figure
that was off to the side

2348
01:48:42,444 --> 01:48:43,740
suddenly lifts up in the air.

2349
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:47,278
And you now see there, held aloft,
what looks to be a humanoid,

2350
01:48:47,278 --> 01:48:51,424
wearing dark leathers, a cloak,
and a hood (groans)

2351
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:55,116
being held about four feet in the air,
tense up.

2352
01:48:55,116 --> 01:48:59,847
Walking out of the next room,
you see Gilmore in disarray,

2353
01:48:59,847 --> 01:49:02,330
a little bit of blood
streaking down the forehead there,

2354
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:04,469
sweaty in the face, with his arm out.

2355
01:49:04,469 --> 01:49:05,947
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Yeah.

2356
01:49:05,947 --> 01:49:10,696
MATT: "What did you say?
That's what I thought!"

2357
01:49:10,696 --> 01:49:12,503
And he closes his hand
and you watch as the figure is just -

2358
01:49:12,503 --> 01:49:13,579
(squelching noise)

2359
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:15,640
ALL: (shocked and impressed exclamations)

2360
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:19,572
MATT: - squashed in this ball of flesh,
and you can see as it slowly twists,

2361
01:49:19,572 --> 01:49:22,545
it's like squeezing water out of a towel,
just blood pours out.

2362
01:49:22,545 --> 01:49:24,551
ALL: (noises of disgust)
TRAVIS: (gleeful laughter) Yes!

2363
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:26,206
MATT: And then he releases his fingers,
and the figure (thud)

2364
01:49:26,206 --> 01:49:28,152
falls limp on the ground
like a crushed doll.

2365
01:49:28,152 --> 01:49:29,873
"(sighs)"

2366
01:49:29,873 --> 01:49:32,463
MARISHA: I drop Polymorph.
MATT: "(startled shout)"

2367
01:49:32,463 --> 01:49:34,507
MARISHA: It's okay! It's okay!
It's me, Keyleth. Sorry.

2368
01:49:34,507 --> 01:49:36,783
MATT: "It's not the night
to be doing that to me!"

2369
01:49:36,783 --> 01:49:38,598
MARISHA: (shouting) I know, I know!

2370
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:41,938
(all laugh)

2371
01:49:41,938 --> 01:49:45,680
MATT: "(sighs) I need a drink."

2372
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:50,234
MARISHA: Gilmore.
Rakshasa. In the town.

2373
01:49:50,234 --> 01:49:53,867
Pretending to be you.
Trying to kill Vax.

2374
01:49:53,867 --> 01:49:55,099
MATT: "Right now?"

2375
01:49:55,099 --> 01:49:59,534
MARISHA: Yes!
Also, a bunch of fucking assassins.

2376
01:49:59,534 --> 01:50:03,030
MATT: He grabs you by the arm -
MARISHA: (scared) Yeah.

2377
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,110
MATT: - and just (shfff).

2378
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,178
There's a rush of air
and a sparkle of purplish-blue energy.

2379
01:50:08,178 --> 01:50:10,475
As you guys
are walking through the tunnel,

2380
01:50:10,475 --> 01:50:12,053
all of a sudden (boof),
with a flash of light,

2381
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:13,212
you see,
standing before you in the tunnel,

2382
01:50:13,212 --> 01:50:16,653
Keyleth and a very harried Gilmore,
who is -

2383
01:50:16,653 --> 01:50:19,052
MARISHA: (breathless) I found Gilmore.
MATT: "(pants)"

2384
01:50:19,052 --> 01:50:20,270
LAURA: I pull out my weapons.

2385
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:21,968
TRAVIS: Are we killing this one?

2386
01:50:21,968 --> 01:50:24,759
MARISHA: No! This is real Gilmore!
Real Gilmore.

2387
01:50:24,759 --> 01:50:28,087
MATT: "Hi. (chuckles)
I'm glad to see you're all right."

2388
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:30,409
LAURA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: (cracks up)

2389
01:50:30,409 --> 01:50:34,158
MATT: "Wasn't expecting it
to be my birthday, as well. (chuckles)"

2390
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:36,042
LIAM: Oh, I'm still here?
Oh, I'm still here!

2391
01:50:36,042 --> 01:50:38,044
SAM: Vax, Vax, quick!
LAURA: (singing) And naked!

2392
01:50:38,044 --> 01:50:41,036
LIAM: Let's look at the backside instead.
This is a little awkward.

2393
01:50:41,036 --> 01:50:42,282
SAM: Vax, ask him a question

2394
01:50:42,282 --> 01:50:44,240
that only Gilmore
would know the answer to.

2395
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:48,853
LIAM: Oh, sh -
What did I tell you in that tavern

2396
01:50:48,853 --> 01:50:51,813
the other night?
A couple of months ago, I guess.

2397
01:50:51,813 --> 01:50:52,911
What did I tell you?

2398
01:50:52,911 --> 01:50:55,150
LAURA: (laughs) Do you remember?
LIAM: Yeah, I do.

2399
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,963
MATT: And you can see now,
he's breathing heavy.

2400
01:50:57,963 --> 01:51:01,454
He's been a little winded.
And his eyes are excited to see -

2401
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:04,296
excited to see you for multiple reasons,
but excited to see that you're alive.

2402
01:51:04,296 --> 01:51:09,971
But as you ask him this question,
you see his demeanor darkens a little.

2403
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:15,727
"That you... had interests elsewhere."

2404
01:51:15,727 --> 01:51:18,219
LIAM: Yeah, that's Gilmore.

2405
01:51:21,769 --> 01:51:23,167
MARISHA: As he says this,

2406
01:51:23,167 --> 01:51:30,133
I do a little cantrip Fog Cloud
around Vax's... privies.

2407
01:51:30,133 --> 01:51:32,501
Just a little floating fog cloud.

2408
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:33,991
LIAM: Oh, not in my hair.
LAURA: A little floating cloud of -

2409
01:51:33,991 --> 01:51:36,118
MARISHA: Right around your waistline.

2410
01:51:36,118 --> 01:51:37,733
ASHLEY: A little tutu.
MARISHA: The old tutu.

2411
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:40,079
LAURA: A little smoky tutu?

2412
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:43,077
MARISHA: A little censor bar.
TRAVIS: Should I throw him the robe?

2413
01:51:43,077 --> 01:51:45,645
TALIESIN: Anime bathhouses.
TRAVIS: I thought I threw him the robe.

2414
01:51:45,645 --> 01:51:47,476
LAURA: He let it go.
He wanted to walk naked.

2415
01:51:47,476 --> 01:51:51,640
LIAM: It's been a shit night.
Who wants to get a drink?

2416
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,742
MARISHA: Well, wait.

2417
01:51:53,742 --> 01:51:57,422
MATT: "I, for one,
could really go for some heavy alcohol."

2418
01:51:57,422 --> 01:52:00,859
MARISHA: Gilmore. Where's Allura?
Where's Allura?

2419
01:52:00,859 --> 01:52:02,895
MATT: "I don't know."

2420
01:52:02,895 --> 01:52:06,422
MARISHA: Gilmore, if they were after us
and they were after you,

2421
01:52:06,422 --> 01:52:09,109
they were probably also after Allura.

2422
01:52:09,109 --> 01:52:11,415
We need to make sure
that everyone on the Council is okay.

2423
01:52:11,415 --> 01:52:13,651
LAURA: Zahra. Kashaw.

2424
01:52:13,651 --> 01:52:14,560
MARISHA: All of them.

2425
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,276
MATT: "Then let us go search.
And then we shall drink.

2426
01:52:18,276 --> 01:52:19,313
"Nevertheless."

2427
01:52:19,313 --> 01:52:22,023
And Gilmore steps into the fog cloud -

2428
01:52:22,023 --> 01:52:24,193
(all laugh)

2429
01:52:24,193 --> 01:52:27,585
MATT: - and puts his arms
around your neck

2430
01:52:27,585 --> 01:52:30,556
and pulls you in, 
deep into his shoulder,

2431
01:52:30,556 --> 01:52:33,142
and as he holds you really close,
he whispers,

2432
01:52:33,142 --> 01:52:34,824
"I'm glad you're all right."

2433
01:52:34,824 --> 01:52:38,301
LIAM: (quietly) I don't say anything.

2434
01:52:38,301 --> 01:52:39,355
MATT: He lets you go.

2435
01:52:39,355 --> 01:52:43,036
LIAM: I pick the dialogue choice
in the Telltale Game, where I say -

2436
01:52:43,036 --> 01:52:44,088
LAURA: You say "dot dot dot"?
ASHLEY: Ellipses.

2437
01:52:44,088 --> 01:52:45,468
MARISHA: Say nothing?
SAM: Dot dot dot?

2438
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:48,807
MATT: He pulls back with a smile
and kind of reads you.

2439
01:52:48,807 --> 01:52:51,455
TRAVIS: Gilmore will remember that.
LAURA: (laughs)

2440
01:52:54,085 --> 01:52:57,188
MATT: He gives a nod of understanding
and takes a step back.

2441
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:59,417
"I'm sorry."

2442
01:52:59,417 --> 01:53:02,204
LIAM: Oh, no no no.

2443
01:53:02,204 --> 01:53:05,042
MATT: "Let's go make sure
that everyone else is all right.

2444
01:53:05,042 --> 01:53:06,875
"Come! Follow me."

2445
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:12,109
He turns around
and goes into a jovial jog.

2446
01:53:12,109 --> 01:53:14,448
You guys make your way up
back up to the castle.

2447
01:53:14,448 --> 01:53:18,959
Kashaw and Zahra are both fine.

2448
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:22,012
You come to them and find
that their rooms were not disturbed,

2449
01:53:22,012 --> 01:53:28,229
as neither of them were in the -
actually, no, Kashaw was.

2450
01:53:31,549 --> 01:53:33,327
SAM: Where was Kashaw?

2451
01:53:33,327 --> 01:53:34,892
LAURA: He fought
the rakshasa to begin with.

2452
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:36,893
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, no.

2453
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:39,814
You do come to the point
where there are now a bunch of guards

2454
01:53:39,814 --> 01:53:42,646
swarmed around the outside
of Kashaw's room.

2455
01:53:42,646 --> 01:53:49,368
As you push past,
there is blood everywhere.

2456
01:53:49,368 --> 01:53:52,319
Everywhere.

2457
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:56,227
On the walls, the ceiling,
the floor, across the bed.

2458
01:53:56,227 --> 01:53:58,345
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2459
01:53:58,345 --> 01:54:01,118
MATT: And you see,
sitting on the edge of the bed,

2460
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:06,570
spear in hand, shield tossed to the side,
also covered in bits of viscera,

2461
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:10,590
Kashaw,
who's currently leaning against the edge.

2462
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:12,267
LIAM: What's up, Stink-Eye?

2463
01:54:14,617 --> 01:54:17,779
MATT: "They knew better, right?
What else was going to happen?"

2464
01:54:17,779 --> 01:54:19,560
TRAVIS: How many were there?

2465
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,119
MATT: "Oh, just one."

2466
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:24,406
TRAVIS: Whoa.
ALL: (impressed laughter)

2467
01:54:24,406 --> 01:54:27,007
TRAVIS: Cool. Cool. Respect.
LAURA: We're grabbing a drink, Kashaw.

2468
01:54:27,007 --> 01:54:31,103
MATT: "I'll take a shower first.
But then a drink."

2469
01:54:31,103 --> 01:54:33,630
MARISHA: I grab him real fast and say,

2470
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:42,984
"It was Hotis, the rakshasa.
Remember? From the Slayer's Take."

2471
01:54:44,554 --> 01:54:46,022
MATT: "I always hated cats."

2472
01:54:48,092 --> 01:54:50,368
ASHLEY: I put out my hand and say,

2473
01:54:50,368 --> 01:54:53,137
"I've heard a lot about you.
It's nice to meet you."

2474
01:54:53,137 --> 01:54:56,944
MATT: "Oh. Nice to meet you, too."

2475
01:54:56,944 --> 01:54:59,201
ASHLEY: I have a robe! I have on a robe!

2476
01:54:59,201 --> 01:55:00,775
TRAVIS: “I have on a robe,
I have on a robe!”

2477
01:55:00,775 --> 01:55:02,755
ASHLEY: I'm dressed! I'm dressed!

2478
01:55:02,755 --> 01:55:05,370
MATT: We'll say
he closes the front a little bit.

2479
01:55:05,379 --> 01:55:08,943
LIAM: It's probably way too large for you.
ASHLEY: A deep V?

2480
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:10,515
MATT: Right, right.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2481
01:55:10,515 --> 01:55:12,733
MATT: "It's nice to meet you, too.

2482
01:55:12,733 --> 01:55:19,393
"I... don't normally dress like this,
either, so don't worry."

2483
01:55:19,393 --> 01:55:22,228
ASHLEY: I'm dressed like this all the time.

2484
01:55:22,228 --> 01:55:24,118
MATT: "Huh.

2485
01:55:24,118 --> 01:55:25,747
"I like you."

2486
01:55:25,747 --> 01:55:28,086
And he walks out.

2487
01:55:28,086 --> 01:55:30,799
"I'll meet you guys in a minute."

2488
01:55:30,799 --> 01:55:33,039
And he goes off to clean himself up.

2489
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:35,513
Zahra's fine.
There's been no attack on Zahra.

2490
01:55:35,513 --> 01:55:36,884
LAURA: Cassandra?
TRAVIS: Allura?

2491
01:55:36,884 --> 01:55:38,960
MARISHA: Yeah.
Let's split up, I guess?

2492
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,710
TALIESIN: Let's all meet in the sitting room
in ten minutes.

2493
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:44,838
So let's have anybody on the Council
meet there in ten minutes.

2494
01:55:44,838 --> 01:55:47,750
I'll send word to the guards
to get everybody where they need to be.

2495
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:50,112
If anything's out of sort,
it will instantly reported to us.

2496
01:55:50,112 --> 01:55:50,967
ASHLEY: Good plan.

2497
01:55:50,967 --> 01:55:53,039
LIAM: I'm going to get my shit.
LAURA: I want to put on my armor.

2498
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:54,425
TALIESIN: I'm also getting my shit.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2499
01:55:54,425 --> 01:55:56,651
LAURA: And then go find Zahra.
MARISHA: I'm going to go look for Allura.

2500
01:55:56,651 --> 01:55:59,245
TRAVIS: I'll go for Cassandra with you
because I don't trust that bitch.

2501
01:55:59,245 --> 01:56:01,825
LIAM: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Oh.

2502
01:56:01,825 --> 01:56:03,574
MATT: All right.
You guys gather your stuff.

2503
01:56:03,574 --> 01:56:06,906
At this time, Cassandra's awake,
and she's actually in the process

2504
01:56:06,906 --> 01:56:08,692
of dealing with the guards
that are coming back with information.

2505
01:56:08,692 --> 01:56:11,603
They've been sweeping parts of the town.
Haven't found anyone else.

2506
01:56:11,603 --> 01:56:17,336
There's been no real follow-up

2507
01:56:17,336 --> 01:56:19,706
to any other figures that have been found,

2508
01:56:19,706 --> 01:56:21,950
beyond the few select individuals.

2509
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:23,325
And it's at this time,

2510
01:56:23,325 --> 01:56:25,213
as you guys gather your stuff
and begin to head back out,

2511
01:56:25,213 --> 01:56:28,505
that Allura comes
into the front of the castle.

2512
01:56:30,715 --> 01:56:34,361
She comes in, hair tossed,
and she looks a little frazzled.

2513
01:56:34,361 --> 01:56:35,908
"Is everyone all right?"

2514
01:56:35,908 --> 01:56:37,981
LAURA: Yes. Kima? Is she all right?

2515
01:56:37,981 --> 01:56:41,700
MATT: She looks over her shoulder,
and you see Kima come walking in,

2516
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:44,966
wearing what looks
like a long nightshirt.

2517
01:56:44,966 --> 01:56:48,983
Her maul in her hand
and dragging behind by the foot

2518
01:56:48,983 --> 01:56:51,824
what looks to be a mostly-mashed face
of one of the assassins

2519
01:56:51,824 --> 01:56:54,037
that tried to find its way
into their home.

2520
01:56:54,037 --> 01:56:55,858
MATT: Dragging a long trail.
MARISHA: Still alive?

2521
01:56:55,858 --> 01:56:57,451
MATT: No, not alive at all.

2522
01:56:57,451 --> 01:56:59,789
The head is caved in,
and there's a long trail of crimson

2523
01:56:59,789 --> 01:57:01,913
that leads all the way
down the walkway,

2524
01:57:01,913 --> 01:57:04,184
down the footpath of the castle,

2525
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,807
and disappears
towards the base of the walkway

2526
01:57:06,807 --> 01:57:08,725
at the north side of Whitestone.

2527
01:57:08,725 --> 01:57:10,758
"(grunts)"

2528
01:57:10,758 --> 01:57:12,346
And throws him. (repeated thuds)

2529
01:57:12,346 --> 01:57:14,404
Tumbles onto the ground,
smears across a bit of the stonework.

2530
01:57:15,504 --> 01:57:16,677
LAURA: Good work.

2531
01:57:16,677 --> 01:57:18,423
MATT: "You, too.

2532
01:57:18,423 --> 01:57:21,267
"I can see the rest of you guys,
at least, seem to be okay."

2533
01:57:21,267 --> 01:57:22,926
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2534
01:57:22,926 --> 01:57:24,789
TALIESIN: Who did get attacked,
out of curiosity?

2535
01:57:24,789 --> 01:57:27,313
What happened to yours?

2536
01:57:27,313 --> 01:57:30,551
MARISHA: This assassin
came through my window.

2537
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:31,818
TALIESIN: Did you kill him?

2538
01:57:31,818 --> 01:57:34,831
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, I...
actually, I don't know.

2539
01:57:34,831 --> 01:57:38,130
I chucked him out the window.
He might still be alive.

2540
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:39,638
TALIESIN: I'm going to
turn to a guard and say,

2541
01:57:39,638 --> 01:57:41,581
"Search underneath the window
of that bedroom.

2542
01:57:41,581 --> 01:57:42,428
"Anything you find -

2543
01:57:42,428 --> 01:57:45,437
"look carefully, find a body.
If you don't find a body, find a trail."

2544
01:57:45,437 --> 01:57:49,490
Good work. Windows are good.

2545
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:54,693
SAM: Do "ra-kasha-kashas"
typically hire people?

2546
01:57:54,693 --> 01:57:57,429
Where do they come from?
Do they come with a band of merry men?

2547
01:57:57,429 --> 01:57:58,573
I don't know anything about them.

2548
01:57:58,573 --> 01:57:59,639
LAURA: They're just tigers. Do tigers -

2549
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:01,183
MATT: Allura goes like,
"What did you say?"

2550
01:58:01,183 --> 01:58:02,669
SAM: Oh, there was
a "raka-sha-sha."

2551
01:58:02,669 --> 01:58:05,737
TALIESIN: A rakshasa.
MARISHA: A rakshasa.

2552
01:58:05,737 --> 01:58:07,314
SAM: No, I think you're saying it wrong.

2553
01:58:07,314 --> 01:58:08,952
LAURA: A hotis. A hotis?

2554
01:58:08,952 --> 01:58:11,418
MARISHA: His NAME was Hotis.

2555
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:14,192
Rakshasas are devils from the Nine Hells.

2556
01:58:14,192 --> 01:58:17,038
MATT: "I'm quite familiar with them, yes."

2557
01:58:17,038 --> 01:58:20,058
SAM: Do they travel
with assassin friends all the time?

2558
01:58:20,058 --> 01:58:21,180
Where do they come from?

2559
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:23,392
MATT: "Well, they come
from the hells,

2560
01:58:23,392 --> 01:58:26,805
"but they make allies
all throughout the realm.

2561
01:58:26,805 --> 01:58:30,170
"They're manipulators.
They masquerade as anyone

2562
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:35,165
"that they think would help
their current intent and goal.

2563
01:58:35,165 --> 01:58:39,025
"They lie, they deceive, they convert."

2564
01:58:39,025 --> 01:58:42,774
LIAM: Keyleth and I encountered him last.

2565
01:58:42,774 --> 01:58:45,048
MARISHA: And Kashaw, wherever he is.

2566
01:58:45,048 --> 01:58:48,449
LIAM: And Kash.
And I took his last blood,

2567
01:58:48,449 --> 01:58:51,747
and I heard a threat,
but I didn't make anything of it.

2568
01:58:51,747 --> 01:58:53,080
MARISHA: We watched him die.

2569
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:57,044
LIAM: And here he is again,
so I suspect this will happen again?

2570
01:58:57,044 --> 01:58:59,609
MATT: "So you slew this rakshasa tonight."

2571
01:58:59,609 --> 01:59:01,347
TRAVIS: Well, this one did.

2572
01:59:06,417 --> 01:59:09,996
MATT: "Well, that will be vengeance
on two, then. It will be back."

2573
01:59:09,996 --> 01:59:14,011
SAM: Is there a way
to prevent the "sha-ka-kan"

2574
01:59:14,011 --> 01:59:16,081
from coming back?

2575
01:59:16,081 --> 01:59:17,883
LIAM: Is there a way
to finish it off for good?

2576
01:59:17,883 --> 01:59:19,395
MARISHA: Permanently.

2577
01:59:19,395 --> 01:59:24,934
MATT: "There are a couple of ways.
All of them involve

2578
01:59:24,934 --> 01:59:28,299
"going to its home plane
and destroying it there.

2579
01:59:28,299 --> 01:59:30,584
"So unless you marvel
a trip to the Nine Hells,

2580
01:59:30,584 --> 01:59:34,938
"it's going to be a bit of paranoia
for a while.

2581
01:59:36,268 --> 01:59:41,115
"It does take weeks, months for them
to regain their form,

2582
01:59:41,115 --> 01:59:43,190
"but the process is very painful for them

2583
01:59:43,190 --> 01:59:46,639
"and, as far as what I've read, 
at least,

2584
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:52,182
"they only really care about getting back
at the ones that took it from them."

2585
01:59:52,192 --> 01:59:55,860
LAURA: So still him and you?
SAM: And now Pike.

2586
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:59,011
MARISHA: Is it one of those things
where it passes off down the line,

2587
01:59:59,011 --> 02:00:03,806
or is this rakshasa going to be pissed
at both of them?

2588
02:00:03,806 --> 02:00:06,490
MATT: "Since you're alive,
its vengeance was not sated.

2589
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:08,198
"I think that's two of you
on its shit list."

2590
02:00:08,198 --> 02:00:12,417
LIAM: Allura,
would you be able to...

2591
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:16,689
give us guidance
on how to get to it?

2592
02:00:16,689 --> 02:00:18,986
I mean, this is a group decision,

2593
02:00:18,986 --> 02:00:22,182
and I'm not going to be fooled
in the same way again.

2594
02:00:22,182 --> 02:00:26,496
I'm going to be sleeping
with my fucking knives for a while.

2595
02:00:28,876 --> 02:00:32,660
But this will just repeat.
How do we get to it?

2596
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:36,738
MATT: "Well, for right now,

2597
02:00:36,738 --> 02:00:40,519
"it's screaming its way back
to the pit of its own creation.

2598
02:00:40,519 --> 02:00:44,186
"It will take weeks, months
before it reforms.

2599
02:00:44,186 --> 02:00:48,300
"It will be very vulnerable
during that time.

2600
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:51,486
"Mind you, it's not
the most welcoming place, either.

2601
02:00:51,486 --> 02:00:57,239
"But (sighs) if we make a journey there
in a few weeks' time,

2602
02:00:57,239 --> 02:01:01,755
"we could probably find
where it's currently recouping,

2603
02:01:01,755 --> 02:01:03,956
"and slay it for good."

2604
02:01:03,956 --> 02:01:05,590
LAURA: How long will that take?

2605
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:08,382
MATT: "How long will what take,
the journey?

2606
02:01:08,382 --> 02:01:12,234
"Instantaneous.
To find it, longer.

2607
02:01:12,234 --> 02:01:16,291
"To survive that journey,
that is no easy task,

2608
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:21,096
"as it is a place of great danger
and great evil."

2609
02:01:21,096 --> 02:01:24,340
LIAM: Are you able to locate it
once it's reformed?

2610
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:26,167
MATT: "It's possible.

2611
02:01:26,167 --> 02:01:29,719
"It depends on what sort of magic wards
it may have.

2612
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:33,076
"I don't know where it is.
We could certainly try."

2613
02:01:33,076 --> 02:01:36,347
MARISHA: I believe it's immune
to certain magics, correct?

2614
02:01:37,877 --> 02:01:39,648
MATT: "That is the issue."

2615
02:01:40,478 --> 02:01:42,537
ASHLEY: Do they get any stronger
when they come back,

2616
02:01:42,537 --> 02:01:44,519
or are they always the same?

2617
02:01:44,519 --> 02:01:47,369
MATT: "All creatures don't like to make
the same mistake twice,

2618
02:01:47,369 --> 02:01:50,113
"thence the why
it seems it brought friends."

2619
02:01:50,113 --> 02:01:52,333
MARISHA: Speaking of those friends.

2620
02:01:52,333 --> 02:01:56,159
You said these rakshasas
are master manipulators.

2621
02:01:56,159 --> 02:02:02,147
Is there a group or an organization here
that has it out for us?

2622
02:02:02,147 --> 02:02:05,632
MARISHA: I mean, I'm sure many, but -
MATT: "I am certain there are many."

2623
02:02:05,632 --> 02:02:08,164
MATT: "As there are a few
that have it out for me, I'm certain."

2624
02:02:08,164 --> 02:02:11,118
LIAM: Were there any survivors
from our assailants?

2625
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:13,039
TALIESIN: We're looking, but none of ours.

2626
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:18,322
LIAM: (sighs) Well, if there are any,
we follow it back to the source.

2627
02:02:18,322 --> 02:02:19,334
TALIESIN: Yes.

2628
02:02:21,984 --> 02:02:24,209
MARISHA: In the meantime,
I guess it's time to drink.

2629
02:02:24,902 --> 02:02:27,937
LIAM: (quietly) Also ale.
TRAVIS: (quietly) Also ale.

2630
02:02:27,937 --> 02:02:31,472
MATT: "It will be hard
to find this rakshasa

2631
02:02:31,472 --> 02:02:33,880
"now or any time
in the very near future,

2632
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:38,421
"as it's still finding its seed
of corporeal form.

2633
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:44,587
"(sighs) But I agree,
this has to be rectified."

2634
02:02:44,587 --> 02:02:48,073
MARISHA: I still feel
like we need to reach out to Vanessa.

2635
02:02:48,073 --> 02:02:50,080
Let her know what's going on.

2636
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,966
LIAM: Maybe up the -

2637
02:02:52,966 --> 02:02:55,797
MARISHA: Cost of the contract?
LIAM: - asking price on that?

2638
02:02:55,797 --> 02:02:59,176
LAURA: (scoffs) Yeah, good luck.
LIAM: (laughs)

2639
02:02:59,176 --> 02:03:03,280
MATT: "I'm a bit confused,
but do what you need to do. Regardless,"

2640
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:08,160
and she looks to Gilmore,
who has taken a breath now

2641
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:12,084
and has pulled an evening flask
out of his night robe.

2642
02:03:12,084 --> 02:03:14,620
He takes a swig off of it, goes,

2643
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:18,940
"I think we need to quicken

2644
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,523
"our reinforcements
of the city.

2645
02:03:20,523 --> 02:03:24,574
"I think we need to make certain
that not only are we scry-proof,

2646
02:03:24,574 --> 02:03:28,808
"but I believe we need to find a way
to alert ourselves

2647
02:03:28,808 --> 02:03:33,890
"of any sort
of celestial or fiend intrusion."

2648
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:36,667
LAUAR: So it's a fiend.
LIAM: A fiend? Also -

2649
02:03:36,667 --> 02:03:38,241
MATT: "The very definition."

2650
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:40,066
LIAM: This is not just a vendetta.

2651
02:03:40,066 --> 02:03:43,608
It knows about Whitestone.
It knows about our base of operations.

2652
02:03:43,608 --> 02:03:44,857
LAURA: How do you know that?

2653
02:03:44,857 --> 02:03:46,191
TALIESIN: Because it came here.

2654
02:03:46,191 --> 02:03:48,722
LIAM: It looked us in the face.
It knows we're here.

2655
02:03:48,722 --> 02:03:51,395
It knows where we are.
It knows all of us.

2656
02:03:51,395 --> 02:03:53,182
It knows him. It knows all of us.

2657
02:03:53,182 --> 02:03:54,937
TALIESIN: It may not know its value,
but it does -

2658
02:03:54,937 --> 02:03:57,615
MATT: The rakshasa -
at this point, Gilmore is like,

2659
02:03:57,615 --> 02:03:59,355
"That's actually a very valid point.

2660
02:03:59,355 --> 02:04:02,799
"How would it - did it meet us?
How would it know what I look like?"

2661
02:04:02,799 --> 02:04:04,697
MARISHA: Good point. Did it meet us?

2662
02:04:04,697 --> 02:04:09,285
LIAM: When was the last time you saw us
before Kiki found you?

2663
02:04:11,295 --> 02:04:13,248
MATT: "You mean last night?"

2664
02:04:13,248 --> 02:04:15,448
LIAM: The last conversation we had.
LAURA: Okay, dinner?

2665
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,210
MATT: "Dinner would have been
the last time, yes."

2666
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:19,768
LAURA: Okay.

2667
02:04:19,768 --> 02:04:23,298
MATT: At this point,
Allura thinks for a second. She goes,

2668
02:04:23,298 --> 02:04:24,637
"I'm fairly certain

2669
02:04:24,637 --> 02:04:27,695
"that they can peer into the minds
of those nearby

2670
02:04:27,695 --> 02:04:30,015
"and can read surface thoughts.

2671
02:04:30,015 --> 02:04:34,039
"It may know more secrets
than you think it does,

2672
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:37,412
"which makes it
that much more important

2673
02:04:37,412 --> 02:04:38,784
"that we eliminate it."

2674
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:41,096
LIAM: Yeah, good.
That guy is a liability.

2675
02:04:41,096 --> 02:04:44,113
SAM: We'll put it on the list.

2676
02:04:44,113 --> 02:04:46,353
LAURA: I know.
Right next to the dragons?

2677
02:04:46,353 --> 02:04:49,293
MARISHA: He could be following us
for a while.

2678
02:04:49,293 --> 02:04:51,982
LIAM: He could rat us out to the dragons.
LAURA: (sighs)

2679
02:04:51,982 --> 02:04:53,829
LIAM: He's fucking pissed off.

2680
02:04:53,829 --> 02:04:57,482
He wants to hurt me, and now her,
as badly as possible.

2681
02:04:57,482 --> 02:04:59,765
All of you matter to us.

2682
02:04:59,765 --> 02:05:04,030
I think the rakshasa
comes before the dragons.

2683
02:05:04,030 --> 02:05:07,309
Maybe not before the Vestiges,
but on the list.

2684
02:05:07,309 --> 02:05:08,887
TALIESIN: If we can put some manpower

2685
02:05:08,887 --> 02:05:12,374
towards discovering where he is
and where he lies

2686
02:05:12,374 --> 02:05:15,298
while we continue our search
for the Vestiges,

2687
02:05:15,298 --> 02:05:17,270
and then once we have a solid lead,
we can follow it through.

2688
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:19,505
MATT: "I can work on that."

2689
02:05:19,505 --> 02:05:22,989
ASHLEY: Can I go over to the dead body

2690
02:05:22,989 --> 02:05:25,205
that Kima threw
into the middle of the room

2691
02:05:25,205 --> 02:05:26,783
and cast Speak With Dead?

2692
02:05:26,783 --> 02:05:28,571
SAM: Ooh.
LIAM: (whispering) Yeah, girl.

2693
02:05:28,571 --> 02:05:31,571
TALIESIN: That's a way to go.
TRAVIS: Is his face super crushed?

2694
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:35,773
TRAVIS: Is it like (krsch)
Halloween mask inside-out?

2695
02:05:35,773 --> 02:05:38,044
MATT: Yeah, it's just smashed inward.

2696
02:05:38,044 --> 02:05:39,728
TRAVIS: Well hold on,
let me reach into his mouth.

2697
02:05:39,728 --> 02:05:41,450
And I reach up under his nasal cavity

2698
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:43,730
and I pop his face back out
just a little bit.

2699
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:46,486
SAM: Ugh.
LIAM: (zombie groans)

2700
02:05:46,486 --> 02:05:49,591
TRAVIS: It's like
a deflated soccer ball, right?

2701
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:51,926
MATT: Yeah, it's horrifying.
Straight-up horrifying.

2702
02:05:51,926 --> 02:05:53,962
ASHLEY: Five questions.
SAM: Five questions?

2703
02:05:53,962 --> 02:05:55,760
LIAM: I thought it was three.
Five? That's good.

2704
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,446
MATT: Okay. All right.

2705
02:05:58,446 --> 02:06:00,092
So you have five questions
you can ask the creature.

2706
02:06:00,092 --> 02:06:02,307
As it sits there and you guys watch

2707
02:06:02,307 --> 02:06:04,193
as Pike comes over in her robe
and sits down next to it.

2708
02:06:04,193 --> 02:06:07,953
You touch your symbol
and reach out and touch the body.

2709
02:06:07,953 --> 02:06:11,157
And all of a sudden,
you watch as the chest rises again.

2710
02:06:11,157 --> 02:06:12,752
"(rasping inhale)"

2711
02:06:12,752 --> 02:06:15,443
You hear this horrible sucking sound
as air is brought into the chest cavity.

2712
02:06:15,443 --> 02:06:17,320
He doesn't breathe out,
he just holds the air in,

2713
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:22,255
and the deformed, wrecked,
bone shard-pierced face

2714
02:06:22,255 --> 02:06:24,519
that once was this assassin,
which you can see now,

2715
02:06:24,519 --> 02:06:27,821
it looks to be
loosely elvish in appearance,

2716
02:06:27,821 --> 02:06:30,464
or at least there's
some essence of elvish to its form,

2717
02:06:30,464 --> 02:06:34,355
but the eyes are gone,
the eyes are just mush.

2718
02:06:34,355 --> 02:06:39,300
It slowly sits up
and turns towards you, Pike, going,

2719
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,056
"(rasping groans)"

2720
02:06:42,056 --> 02:06:44,664
ASHLEY: Who sent you?

2721
02:06:44,664 --> 02:06:49,993
MATT: "(slowly) Hotis..."

2722
02:06:49,993 --> 02:06:51,344
ASHLEY: Hotis.

2723
02:06:51,344 --> 02:06:53,804
MATT: "...hired us."

2724
02:06:53,804 --> 02:06:55,862
ASHLEY: What was -

2725
02:06:55,862 --> 02:06:58,374
LAURA, LIAM, AND TRAVIS:
(overlapping) Hotis hired us.

2726
02:06:58,374 --> 02:06:59,526
ASHLEY: Hotis hired us.

2727
02:07:02,106 --> 02:07:04,052
What is your organization?

2728
02:07:06,542 --> 02:07:13,480
MATT: "We run The Clasp in Stillben."

2729
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:15,001
SAM: Stillben.

2730
02:07:15,001 --> 02:07:17,809
TRAVIS: The Clasp in Stillben.
LAURA: Sheesh.

2731
02:07:17,809 --> 02:07:19,474
ASHLEY: Three more questions.

2732
02:07:19,474 --> 02:07:22,774
TRAVIS: How did the rakshasa
know to find us here?

2733
02:07:22,774 --> 02:07:25,487
How did Hotis know.

2734
02:07:25,487 --> 02:07:29,459
ASHLEY: How did Hotis know
to find us here?

2735
02:07:29,459 --> 02:07:32,394
MATT: "I don't know.

2736
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:34,461
"He had information.

2737
02:07:34,461 --> 02:07:39,671
"He led us here.
Instructed our strikes."

2738
02:07:42,681 --> 02:07:46,273
SAM: How many men?
TALIESIN: How many of them were there?

2739
02:07:46,273 --> 02:07:49,120
ASHLEY: How many of you were there?

2740
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:53,664
MATT: "We were 6 in total."

2741
02:07:53,664 --> 02:07:56,868
LIAM: You've got one more question.

2742
02:07:56,868 --> 02:07:58,456
TALIESIN: Where were they all
supposed to meet

2743
02:07:58,456 --> 02:07:59,574
when everything was finished?

2744
02:07:59,574 --> 02:08:01,222
TRAVIS: Or who would know 
more than him?

2745
02:08:01,222 --> 02:08:03,802
LIAM: Who would know more?
LAURA: Who is his boss or something?

2746
02:08:03,802 --> 02:08:06,142
ASHLEY: Who his boss was?
TRAVIS: Or who does he report to?

2747
02:08:06,142 --> 02:08:08,254
LAURA: Within The Clasp.
Who does he report to in The Clasp?

2748
02:08:08,254 --> 02:08:09,113
LIAM: Who gives you your orders?

2749
02:08:09,113 --> 02:08:10,928
ASHLEY: Who gives you your orders?

2750
02:08:10,928 --> 02:08:14,208
LAURA: (whispering) Within The Clasp.
ASHLEY: Within The Clasp?

2751
02:08:14,208 --> 02:08:17,127
MATT: (chuckling) That's a fine -

2752
02:08:17,127 --> 02:08:18,817
LAURA: I have one job on this ship.

2753
02:08:18,817 --> 02:08:20,675
ASHLEY: I have one job -
LAURA AND TRAVIS: It's stupid -

2754
02:08:20,675 --> 02:08:22,070
ASHLEY AND TRAVIS:
(shouting) - but I'm going to do it!

2755
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:27,945
(all laugh)

2756
02:08:27,945 --> 02:08:30,093
TRAVIS: So good.
ASHLEY: Yes.

2757
02:08:30,093 --> 02:08:34,718
MATT: "Spireling Veekar. (groans)"

2758
02:08:34,718 --> 02:08:35,757
MARISHA: Veekar.

2759
02:08:35,757 --> 02:08:37,871
MATT: And with that,
the last bit of air

2760
02:08:37,871 --> 02:08:39,578
that had been trapped
in the chest cavity

2761
02:08:39,578 --> 02:08:42,173
has been utilized
and the body (rasping groan)

2762
02:08:42,173 --> 02:08:45,882
goes back to its still rest,
no longer moving,

2763
02:08:45,882 --> 02:08:49,554
no longer puppeteered
by your divine energies.

2764
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:50,698
TRAVIS: I'll take care of this.

2765
02:08:50,698 --> 02:08:52,483
MARISHA: Veekar.
LAURA: Spireling Veekar.

2766
02:08:52,483 --> 02:08:55,748
TALIESIN: So I think we have 4 dead bodies.
We're missing 2, then?

2767
02:08:55,748 --> 02:08:57,916
LAURA: Wait, 4 dead bodies? Wait -

2768
02:08:57,916 --> 02:08:59,887
SAM: Wait, there's Kashaw's.
TALIESIN: Kashaw's? Oh.

2769
02:08:59,887 --> 02:09:00,976
LAURA: Plus Kima's.

2770
02:09:00,976 --> 02:09:03,653
TALIESIN: Mine, yours -

2771
02:09:03,653 --> 02:09:06,791
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Gilmore's.

2772
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:07,937
MATT: And Gilmore's like,

2773
02:09:07,937 --> 02:09:11,208
"(weak chuckle)
I actually have one that's pretty rough

2774
02:09:11,208 --> 02:09:12,513
"in my place right now."

2775
02:09:12,513 --> 02:09:13,991
LIAM: He got Akira'd.

2776
02:09:13,991 --> 02:09:15,274
MATT: "I got a little angry."

2777
02:09:15,274 --> 02:09:17,159
LAURA: Did you kill one or two?

2778
02:09:17,159 --> 02:09:18,783
MATT: "Oh, just one."

2779
02:09:18,783 --> 02:09:20,459
MARISHA: So the only one
that's missing in action

2780
02:09:20,459 --> 02:09:21,749
is the one
that I shoved out the window?

2781
02:09:21,749 --> 02:09:23,757
TALIESIN: And we're waiting for news
on whether that one -

2782
02:09:23,757 --> 02:09:25,806
MATT: "Is there one that was left alive?"

2783
02:09:25,806 --> 02:09:28,458
MARISHA: Well, there was one
that was shoved out a window,

2784
02:09:28,458 --> 02:09:30,528
so hopefully he died.

2785
02:09:30,528 --> 02:09:33,264
MATT: "We'll find out."
TRAVIS: Hm. Sloppy.

2786
02:09:33,264 --> 02:09:34,878
LIAM: Broke his legs
and his heart never woke.

2787
02:09:34,878 --> 02:09:35,913
MARISHA: I heard that, Grog.

2788
02:09:35,913 --> 02:09:38,088
TRAVIS: Oh. (ahem) I said. Super.

2789
02:09:38,088 --> 02:09:40,416
LAURA: (laughs) Good save.

2790
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:46,123
MATT: "All right. Drinks? Please?"

2791
02:09:46,123 --> 02:09:47,078
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2792
02:09:47,078 --> 02:09:50,320
SAM: At some point, Percy,
ask Gilmore about that robe.

2793
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:51,660
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

2794
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,354
I still actually have it,
it occurs to me.

2795
02:09:53,354 --> 02:09:54,957
I haven't put it down yet.

2796
02:09:54,957 --> 02:09:57,776
MATT: (laughs) He's holding it
like a pair of soiled underpants, all -

2797
02:09:57,776 --> 02:09:59,874
TALIESIN: I've actually
been using Bad News like a -

2798
02:09:59,874 --> 02:10:02,426
MARISHA: Like a surrender flag?

2799
02:10:02,426 --> 02:10:06,228
TALIESIN: Like spindle. Like a bindle.

2800
02:10:06,228 --> 02:10:08,202
MARISHA: There you go.
TALIESIN: Hobo.

2801
02:10:08,202 --> 02:10:09,208
MARISHA: Hobo bindle.

2802
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:12,260
TALIESIN: This was given to Vax.

2803
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:15,727
It was mystical.
It was attached to your skin.

2804
02:10:15,727 --> 02:10:17,266
LIAM: Peeling the skin off my flesh.

2805
02:10:17,266 --> 02:10:18,634
MATT: "(shudders)"

2806
02:10:18,634 --> 02:10:23,463
He takes it for a second.
He puts his hand over

2807
02:10:23,463 --> 02:10:26,099
and his eyes flicker for a second
with a spark of arcane energy

2808
02:10:26,099 --> 02:10:27,301
and he sits back.

2809
02:10:27,301 --> 02:10:32,494
"No, this is indeed
a cursed robe.

2810
02:10:32,494 --> 02:10:35,388
"It's a Robe of Flaying."

2811
02:10:35,388 --> 02:10:37,298
LAURA: A Robe of Flaying?!
TRAVIS: Flaying?

2812
02:10:37,298 --> 02:10:38,535
SAM AND LAURA: Gross.
ASHLEY: Yikes.

2813
02:10:38,535 --> 02:10:39,963
TRAVIS: Awesome.

2814
02:10:39,963 --> 02:10:41,995
SAM: Is it worth anything?

2815
02:10:41,995 --> 02:10:44,258
MATT: "(chuckles)
To the right people, maybe."

2816
02:10:44,258 --> 02:10:45,783
LIAM: The Clasp, yeah.
SAM: Well, why don't you take it?

2817
02:10:45,783 --> 02:10:48,730
MATT: "Oh, I don't want to have
any hand in this type of business.

2818
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:55,324
"I'm sorry. I deal
with above-the-board magical items.

2819
02:10:55,324 --> 02:10:59,011
"You've gone creative with me,
but even that was relatively harmless.

2820
02:10:59,011 --> 02:11:02,513
"This slowly takes the skin
off of its wearer.

2821
02:11:02,513 --> 02:11:04,876
"I don't wish to have this
part of my repertoire."

2822
02:11:04,876 --> 02:11:10,469
ASHLEY: If we destroy it, though,
would that hurt Vax?

2823
02:11:10,469 --> 02:11:13,511
MATT: "Well,
if you've removed it from him,

2824
02:11:13,511 --> 02:11:15,038
"then the enchantment's been broken."

2825
02:11:15,038 --> 02:11:19,609
SAM: So does it - do you have to -
anyone you put it on, it curses them?

2826
02:11:19,609 --> 02:11:21,443
LIAM: It sticks.
It's like fucking flypaper.

2827
02:11:21,443 --> 02:11:23,668
SAM: Keep that robe. (laughs)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2828
02:11:23,668 --> 02:11:25,402
TRAVIS: I'll keep it.

2829
02:11:25,402 --> 02:11:26,793
LAURA: In the Bag of Holding?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2830
02:11:26,793 --> 02:11:28,013
LIAM: Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

2831
02:11:28,013 --> 02:11:30,371
LAURA: Don't play with it, Grog.
TRAVIS: Why?

2832
02:11:30,371 --> 02:11:32,534
LAURA: Just don't put it on
because you think it will be fun.

2833
02:11:32,534 --> 02:11:34,856
LIAM: You look way better mostly naked,
so don't -

2834
02:11:34,856 --> 02:11:36,995
TRAVIS: I'm not putting my bits
where Vax's were.

2835
02:11:36,995 --> 02:11:38,515
I'll just keep it in the Bag.

2836
02:11:38,515 --> 02:11:39,890
LIAM: Ow, that hurts my feelings.

2837
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:40,953
LAURA: Percy?

2838
02:11:40,953 --> 02:11:42,526
TALIESIN: Yes?

2839
02:11:42,526 --> 02:11:46,182
LAURA: Are your guards
very well-trained in tracking?

2840
02:11:46,182 --> 02:11:50,135
TALIESIN: I honestly don't know.
I haven't been here.

2841
02:11:50,135 --> 02:11:52,125
But we hunt. We are...

2842
02:11:54,255 --> 02:11:55,802
everybody here hunts.

2843
02:11:55,802 --> 02:11:58,977
LAURA: Trinket has their scent.
I mean, I can send him to help.

2844
02:11:58,977 --> 02:12:01,705
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.
That's a brilliant idea. Yes, please.

2845
02:12:01,705 --> 02:12:04,584
We also, I might add, in theory,
have a wolf patrolling the area.

2846
02:12:04,584 --> 02:12:06,881
TRAVIS: Yes, Baldrick's somewhere.

2847
02:12:06,881 --> 02:12:08,938
TALIESIN: And I'm sure he's aware
that there's a commotion.

2848
02:12:08,938 --> 02:12:11,226
LIAM: I walk over to Gilmore for a second.

2849
02:12:11,226 --> 02:12:15,359
LIAM: Shaun, you know - sorry.
MATT: "Ah. Yes?"

2850
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:17,451
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hand that over, big guy.

2851
02:12:17,451 --> 02:12:18,580
MATT: "But of course."
LIAM: Yeah, thank you.

2852
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:20,291
MATT: "You've certainly earned it."

2853
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:22,512
LIAM: You know everything 
about everything.

2854
02:12:22,512 --> 02:12:25,977
MATT: "(stuttering) I wouldn't say
I know everything about everything."

2855
02:12:25,977 --> 02:12:27,376
LIAM: It's close.
MATT: "Between the two of us,"

2856
02:12:27,376 --> 02:12:28,778
MATT: And he motions toward Allura.

2857
02:12:28,778 --> 02:12:31,076
"Pretty sure we know everything,
but she more than I."

2858
02:12:31,076 --> 02:12:36,333
LIAM: I can agree with that.
We found this in a tomb.

2859
02:12:36,333 --> 02:12:38,488
LAURA: What are you pointing at?

2860
02:12:38,488 --> 02:12:39,679
SAM: His pec.

2861
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:41,137
MARISHA: Your heart?
LAURA: Your boob?

2862
02:12:41,137 --> 02:12:44,807
LIAM: My fucking rock-hard pec.
The ARMOR. I tap the armor,

2863
02:12:44,807 --> 02:12:48,127
as you fucking very well knew, 
Laura Bailey.

2864
02:12:48,127 --> 02:12:53,456
I kind of understand it.
Can you tell anything about it?

2865
02:12:53,456 --> 02:12:56,062
LAURA: Other than the fact
that it smells really bad?

2866
02:12:56,062 --> 02:12:57,629
LIAM: Shush, yeah,
it does smell bad.

2867
02:12:57,629 --> 02:12:59,536
Scanlan gave me some patchouli
to rub on it,

2868
02:12:59,536 --> 02:13:01,226
but it only does half the job.

2869
02:13:01,226 --> 02:13:06,314
What can you tell me about it?
It belonged to a god.

2870
02:13:06,314 --> 02:13:09,117
MATT: He takes a minute
and walks around you,

2871
02:13:09,117 --> 02:13:10,862
looking at the armor up and down.

2872
02:13:10,862 --> 02:13:14,122
Looking at you up and down a little bit.
But mostly at the armor.

2873
02:13:14,122 --> 02:13:19,754
His eyes flare a few times
with arcane sparks.

2874
02:13:19,754 --> 02:13:24,717
"This is a powerful Vestige,
my friend.

2875
02:13:24,717 --> 02:13:28,087
"This has existed for quite some time,
and you've -

2876
02:13:28,087 --> 02:13:32,370
"well, there's certainly
a bit of dark divine energy around it.

2877
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:35,081
"It looks like it has the capability

2878
02:13:35,081 --> 02:13:39,872
"to resist most elements
when given the instruction,

2879
02:13:39,872 --> 02:13:42,031
"and it safeguards
the life of the bearer

2880
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:45,739
"and it looks like
there's some sort of a -

2881
02:13:47,459 --> 02:13:49,113
"Tell you what. Follow me."

2882
02:13:49,113 --> 02:13:50,059
LIAM: Yeah?

2883
02:13:50,059 --> 02:13:52,244
MATT: And he stops and he goes,

2884
02:13:52,244 --> 02:13:55,513
"It's really me this time!
Follow me."

2885
02:13:55,513 --> 02:13:57,080
LIAM: I know it is.

2886
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:58,377
MATT: "All right."

2887
02:13:58,377 --> 02:14:04,228
And he walks outside
of the front of the castle to the walkway,

2888
02:14:04,228 --> 02:14:08,205
stepping over the crimson smear
that once was the one assassin.

2889
02:14:08,205 --> 02:14:10,358
And he walks up to the edge

2890
02:14:10,358 --> 02:14:13,036
of the sheer cliffs
that are on each side of that walkway

2891
02:14:13,036 --> 02:14:16,693
and the elevated, cleaved mountain
the castle was built on.

2892
02:14:16,693 --> 02:14:18,069
He walks up
to the very edge with you and goes,

2893
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:20,922
"Do you trust me?"

2894
02:14:24,612 --> 02:14:25,865
LIAM: (quietly) I do.

2895
02:14:25,865 --> 02:14:27,887
MATT: As soon as you look down,

2896
02:14:27,887 --> 02:14:30,109
you feel a thrust
as he pushes you off the cliff.

2897
02:14:32,489 --> 02:14:39,287
At that moment, you suddenly,
instinctively, look up

2898
02:14:39,287 --> 02:14:42,837
and from outside
the back of the armor, (fwwsh) -

2899
02:14:42,837 --> 02:14:44,540
TRAVIS: What?!
MARISHA: Oh.

2900
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:46,532
MATT: - these giant black raven wings
spill out from the sides.

2901
02:14:46,532 --> 02:14:49,266
LAURA: Wait, so you could have flown
when you came out of the dragon?

2902
02:14:49,266 --> 02:14:51,751
LIAM: Only if I know how to work it.
LAURA: (gasps)

2903
02:14:51,751 --> 02:14:53,845
MATT: You get the sense

2904
02:14:53,845 --> 02:14:58,992
that this feature to the armor
was only recently -

2905
02:14:58,992 --> 02:15:02,020
LAURA: Oh, shit.
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking shit.

2906
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:03,643
TRAVIS: Get it, archangel.

2907
02:15:03,643 --> 02:15:04,672
MATT: You go from falling

2908
02:15:04,672 --> 02:15:07,581
to swooping over the forest
on the outside of Whitestone.

2909
02:15:07,581 --> 02:15:09,845
SAM: Oh, he's The Crow! He's The Crow!
LAURA: What the fuck?

2910
02:15:09,845 --> 02:15:13,291
LAURA: He can fly? 
HE can fucking fly?!

2911
02:15:13,291 --> 02:15:16,741
LIAM: After doing that, I double back
and I fly up that same cliff

2912
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:18,571
and I lift Gilmore up in the sky.

2913
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:19,780
MATT: "(startled noise)"

2914
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:22,835
LIAM: (shouting) You fucking
brilliant bastard!

2915
02:15:22,835 --> 02:15:25,427
Thank you. Thank you.

2916
02:15:25,427 --> 02:15:26,967
(sighs) This is embarrassing.

2917
02:15:26,967 --> 02:15:28,347
I float us back down.

2918
02:15:28,347 --> 02:15:30,787
MATT: You can see he's a little nervous,
but he's smiling.

2919
02:15:30,787 --> 02:15:32,149
"(nervous laughter)"

2920
02:15:32,149 --> 02:15:33,050
LIAM: Sorry.

2921
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:35,834
MATT: "Thank you. No, it's all right.
I would have been fine."

2922
02:15:35,834 --> 02:15:39,166
LIAM: You are a dear, dear friend.
You are a dear friend.

2923
02:15:39,166 --> 02:15:44,411
And I give him a big diagonal hug.
A long, strong hug.

2924
02:15:44,411 --> 02:15:47,164
MATT: He freezes for a moment,

2925
02:15:47,164 --> 02:15:53,386
still figuring out his boundaries
with the dynamic being what it is,

2926
02:15:53,386 --> 02:15:56,297
but eventually he gives in
and you feel his arms take you in as well,

2927
02:15:56,297 --> 02:16:01,395
and you guys have this long, honest,
connecting hug.

2928
02:16:01,395 --> 02:16:05,831
And as this happens,
the wings also wrap around

2929
02:16:05,831 --> 02:16:07,449
and envelop the both of you.

2930
02:16:07,449 --> 02:16:09,748
TRAVIS: Good moment.
LAURA: (frustrated) It's so ridiculous.

2931
02:16:09,748 --> 02:16:11,969
TRAVIS: He's alive. Let it go.

2932
02:16:11,969 --> 02:16:16,642
MATT: And then time seems to pass
for a minute

2933
02:16:16,642 --> 02:16:21,783
and as you release him,
the wings (fluttering sound)

2934
02:16:21,783 --> 02:16:24,444
scatter into black feathers in the wind
and disappear.

2935
02:16:24,444 --> 02:16:26,208
SAM: (whispering) Wow.
LAURA: (frustrated noise)

2936
02:16:26,208 --> 02:16:27,783
MATT: He steps away from you
and you can see

2937
02:16:27,783 --> 02:16:31,014
there's just a little streak
down the side of his face.

2938
02:16:31,014 --> 02:16:33,375
And he reaches up
and smacks you on the cheek a little bit.

2939
02:16:33,375 --> 02:16:35,083
"Glad you're all right."

2940
02:16:40,053 --> 02:16:43,149
LIAM: I am a great ally to you.

2941
02:16:43,149 --> 02:16:48,439
And if you need any favors,
I am your friend.

2942
02:16:48,439 --> 02:16:53,202
MATT: "That goes both ways.
Don't forget that."

2943
02:16:53,202 --> 02:16:56,524
LAURA: I walk up and I -

2944
02:16:56,524 --> 02:16:58,621
LIAM: Ow! Where were you,
what the fuck - oh, you're -

2945
02:16:58,621 --> 02:17:00,609
LAURA: You flying fuck. You flying fuck!

2946
02:17:00,609 --> 02:17:02,873
LIAM: I forgot you were a rogue. Yeah...

2947
02:17:02,873 --> 02:17:06,228
LAURA: (angry noise) I mean,
congratulations, it's really cool!

2948
02:17:06,228 --> 02:17:08,599
LIAM: That broom is really cool.
That you stole.

2949
02:17:08,599 --> 02:17:11,856
LAURA: If I didn't fall off of it.
You have fucking wings! Jesus.

2950
02:17:11,856 --> 02:17:13,086
I walk away.

2951
02:17:13,086 --> 02:17:14,224
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.
MATT: (laughs)

2952
02:17:14,224 --> 02:17:17,414
LIAM: I follow her and I stop her
and I give her a hug and I say,

2953
02:17:17,414 --> 02:17:19,274
LIAM: "I love you."
LAURA: (angry groan)

2954
02:17:19,274 --> 02:17:22,046
LIAM: I love you. I love you. I love you.

2955
02:17:22,046 --> 02:17:26,968
(whispering) And I'll be
less of a fuckwit lately, I promise.

2956
02:17:26,968 --> 02:17:28,372
LAURA: Really?
LIAM: (whispering) Yeah.

2957
02:17:28,372 --> 02:17:29,912
LAURA: All right.
LIAM: Yeah.

2958
02:17:29,912 --> 02:17:31,863
LAURA: I love you, too.
I'm glad you're not dead.

2959
02:17:31,863 --> 02:17:35,541
MARISHA: Keyleth has been
in the door frame,

2960
02:17:35,541 --> 02:17:37,461
watching all this happen.
I'm in the door frame.

2961
02:17:37,461 --> 02:17:39,444
TALIESIN: I'm slowly -
I'm going to walk in

2962
02:17:39,444 --> 02:17:42,765
and have a moment
and look Vax over.

2963
02:17:44,025 --> 02:17:45,344
LIAM: Hey, Shaun?

2964
02:17:48,484 --> 02:17:51,484
Once in a while? All the time?

2965
02:17:51,484 --> 02:17:56,845
MATT: "Oh, that's once every dawn,
that can return to you."

2966
02:17:56,845 --> 02:17:58,739
LAURA: Oh. I'm glad
I didn't push you off the cliff!

2967
02:17:58,739 --> 02:18:01,716
I almost did.
Wow, good to know.

2968
02:18:01,716 --> 02:18:03,168
MATT: (laughing)
That would have been really funny.

2969
02:18:03,168 --> 02:18:04,603
LIAM: That would have been hilarious.

2970
02:18:04,603 --> 02:18:05,975
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Holy shit.

2971
02:18:05,975 --> 02:18:09,015
ASHLEY: (laughs) You dick. (gasps)

2972
02:18:09,015 --> 02:18:13,098
MATT: It's for up to an hour,
it can last, just so you're aware.

2973
02:18:13,098 --> 02:18:18,469
But once per day,
you give yourself a fly speed of 60.

2974
02:18:18,469 --> 02:18:21,831
LIAM: 60. Same speed as my sister.
LAURA: No, I'm less, aren't I?

2975
02:18:21,831 --> 02:18:24,322
LIAM: Thank you, Shaun-slash-Matt.

2976
02:18:24,322 --> 02:18:27,754
TALIESIN: There's one last thing.

2977
02:18:27,754 --> 02:18:29,798
And I walk up and I look you over

2978
02:18:29,798 --> 02:18:35,397
and I pull out
the raven head cloak clasp

2979
02:18:35,397 --> 02:18:40,705
and I pin it to hold the cloak together.

2980
02:18:40,705 --> 02:18:44,467
And it's very deep, pitted silver
with a slight ruby tinge to it.

2981
02:18:44,467 --> 02:18:48,361
And it smells FABULOUS.

2982
02:18:48,361 --> 02:18:51,630
And it smells better
the more you sweat.

2983
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:54,870
And it smells 
of the Raven Queen's temple.

2984
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,852
Now talk to Keyleth.

2985
02:18:59,972 --> 02:19:03,992
I'm counting on you. Good luck.

2986
02:19:03,992 --> 02:19:05,472
And I walk away.

2987
02:19:05,472 --> 02:19:07,460
LIAM: (yelling after him)
You're hard to read, man!

2988
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,781
TALIESIN: I know!

2989
02:19:08,781 --> 02:19:12,474
TRAVIS: Cask of ale is out
and the ale is flowing.

2990
02:19:12,474 --> 02:19:14,348
LAURA: Oh, shit! Shit. 
Tracking the guy.

2991
02:19:14,348 --> 02:19:17,641
SAM: Have the guards reported yet?

2992
02:19:17,641 --> 02:19:21,155
MATT: By this time,
some of the guards have come back,

2993
02:19:21,155 --> 02:19:22,880
reporting that they haven't
seen anything yet.

2994
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:25,534
There are folks that were following
the tracks into the forest,

2995
02:19:25,534 --> 02:19:28,453
but the tracks have mostly gone cold.

2996
02:19:28,453 --> 02:19:31,917
Whoever it is knows how to not be found.
It's part of their job.

2997
02:19:31,917 --> 02:19:35,005
SAM: You could spend the night
tracking him.

2998
02:19:35,005 --> 02:19:37,618
LAURA: I could.
SAM: Or we could just drink.

2999
02:19:37,618 --> 02:19:39,042
MARISHA: Or we could just drink.

3000
02:19:39,042 --> 02:19:43,266
We know who the fucker was.
We know who he's going back to.

3001
02:19:43,266 --> 02:19:44,335
TRAVIS: Yep.

3002
02:19:44,335 --> 02:19:45,805
LAURA: We know he's going
back to Stillben.

3003
02:19:45,805 --> 02:19:50,404
MARISHA: To Spireling Veekar.
We know where he's headed.

3004
02:19:50,404 --> 02:19:53,638
TALIESIN: You guys
are going to drink for a bit?

3005
02:19:53,638 --> 02:19:55,792
LIAM: I'll do whatever you do.

3006
02:19:55,792 --> 02:19:57,904
TALIESIN: I'm going to go out
past the wall

3007
02:19:57,904 --> 02:20:00,334
and see if I can yell for the wolf.

3008
02:20:00,334 --> 02:20:02,869
MARISHA: Galdrick.
TALIESIN: Galdrick.

3009
02:20:02,869 --> 02:20:04,687
MATT: Galdrick. All right.

3010
02:20:04,687 --> 02:20:08,834
TALIESIN: I’m bringing a swath
from one of the -

3011
02:20:11,144 --> 02:20:15,461
MATT: Okay. You shout out
for about 10, 15 minutes or so

3012
02:20:15,461 --> 02:20:21,036
before you hear a distant howl. (howl)

3013
02:20:21,036 --> 02:20:22,853
TALIESIN: Galdrick!

3014
02:20:22,853 --> 02:20:26,969
MATT: A few more moments pass
before you hear (panting).

3015
02:20:26,969 --> 02:20:28,703
Coming up
from the outside of the forest,

3016
02:20:28,703 --> 02:20:34,182
the large gray dark wolf.
(padding footfalls)

3017
02:20:34,182 --> 02:20:37,119
TALIESIN: I show the blood-soaked chunk.

3018
02:20:37,119 --> 02:20:40,238
MATT: "(sniffs)"

3019
02:20:40,238 --> 02:20:43,097
TALIESIN: There were six. 
Now there’s one.

3020
02:20:43,097 --> 02:20:47,883
If you find him,
we would be forever grateful.

3021
02:20:47,883 --> 02:20:49,675
MATT: "(licks chops)"

3022
02:20:49,675 --> 02:20:53,247
Licks his deep,
pearly-white bladed incisors

3023
02:20:53,247 --> 02:20:54,701
and turns around and -

3024
02:20:54,701 --> 02:20:57,527
"(grunts)" -

3025
02:20:57,527 --> 02:21:01,034
takes off into the forest
at triple-speed.

3026
02:21:01,034 --> 02:21:03,003
TALIESIN: Now I’m going to go up
and have a drink.

3027
02:21:03,003 --> 02:21:07,549
TRAVIS: Triple-speed, damn.
That’s a fast-ass wolf.

3028
02:21:07,549 --> 02:21:10,849
MATT: All right.
You all at these twilight hours

3029
02:21:10,849 --> 02:21:13,888
find yourselves gathering
your friends and allies

3030
02:21:13,888 --> 02:21:17,657
for a long-needed drink
until the sun begins to rise.

3031
02:21:17,657 --> 02:21:22,379
You all appreciate the friendship
that you’ve maintained,

3032
02:21:22,379 --> 02:21:25,791
the survival of those
that were endangered,

3033
02:21:25,791 --> 02:21:28,979
and eventually find yourself,
rather tipsy,

3034
02:21:28,979 --> 02:21:31,074
finding your way back to bed,

3035
02:21:31,074 --> 02:21:35,115
this time with quadruple the guards
at the door -

3036
02:21:35,115 --> 02:21:37,772
LAURA: Fully armored.
MATT: - of each of your rooms, resting.

3037
02:21:37,772 --> 02:21:39,201
MATT: We’ll take a quick break.

3038
02:21:39,201 --> 02:21:40,921
We’ll be back here
to get to the next bit of this episode.

3039
02:21:40,921 --> 02:21:42,681
See you guys here in a few minutes.

3040
02:21:42,681 --> 02:21:50,848
[Critical Role resumes at 2:34:15]

3041
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:18,349
MATT: Welcome back! So.

3042
02:34:18,349 --> 02:34:22,584
As you guys find yourself
having a good night’s sleep,

3043
02:34:22,584 --> 02:34:26,915
waking up restfully around midday
to the early afternoon here in Whitestone.

3044
02:34:26,915 --> 02:34:28,954
Everyone except for you, Vax.

3045
02:34:28,954 --> 02:34:34,460
You, as you went to sleep, found,
as opposed to a restful night,

3046
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:36,078
especially given the circumstance,

3047
02:34:36,078 --> 02:34:39,457
a perpetual onslaught
of terrible nightmares

3048
02:34:39,457 --> 02:34:43,752
recapping the events of the night before
with alternate possibilities,

3049
02:34:43,752 --> 02:34:47,877
looking and seeing Gilmore
plunging the blade into your stomach,

3050
02:34:47,877 --> 02:34:52,037
seeing your friends and family
torn apart by demons

3051
02:34:52,037 --> 02:34:55,572
called forth by this rakshasa
returning for vengeance.

3052
02:34:55,572 --> 02:34:57,766
You were tossing and turning
and woke up sweaty.

3053
02:34:57,766 --> 02:35:00,744
Unfortunately, you do not
get the benefits of a full rest.

3054
02:35:00,744 --> 02:35:03,595
So you're still at the hit point value
that you had before.

3055
02:35:03,595 --> 02:35:06,482
LIAM: And I can't use hit dice, right?
ASHLEY: What?

3056
02:35:06,482 --> 02:35:07,724
MATT: You can use hit dice.

3057
02:35:07,724 --> 02:35:08,708
LIAM: I can use hit dice?
MATT: Yeah.

3058
02:35:08,708 --> 02:35:09,930
ASHLEY: I can also heal you.

3059
02:35:09,930 --> 02:35:13,961
LIAM: I think it might be more than that.
I feel weird. I feel really weird.

3060
02:35:13,961 --> 02:35:18,437
I'm going to have some -
I'm going to have -

3061
02:35:18,437 --> 02:35:21,754
What's the D&D term for Bloody Mary?

3062
02:35:21,754 --> 02:35:25,258
I need a mimosa or a Bloody Mary
and I'm going to take a rest.

3063
02:35:25,258 --> 02:35:27,225
MARISHA: A little hair of the dog?

3064
02:35:28,415 --> 02:35:31,176
LIAM: And use some hit dice.

3065
02:35:31,776 --> 02:35:36,717
TRAVIS: Technically, hair of the dog
would be poisoning him again this morning.

3066
02:35:36,717 --> 02:35:40,487
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
TRAVIS: Which we can do.

3067
02:35:40,487 --> 02:35:42,060
MARISHA: Which we could do.
You never know.

3068
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:45,398
MATT: You actually take the time
to go ahead and rest up,

3069
02:35:45,398 --> 02:35:47,847
and even then,
your body's just restless.

3070
02:35:47,847 --> 02:35:49,123
LIAM: Hit dice does nothing?

3071
02:35:49,123 --> 02:35:52,189
MATT: You find yourself
unable to spend those, either.

3072
02:35:52,189 --> 02:35:54,478
You're basically rocking in place

3073
02:35:54,478 --> 02:35:57,181
and playing over the imagery in your mind
over and over again,

3074
02:35:57,181 --> 02:35:59,722
and there's a perpetual cold sweat
across your brow.

3075
02:35:59,722 --> 02:36:01,995
LAURA: Can I go knock on his door
in the morning?

3076
02:36:01,997 --> 02:36:03,976
LAURA: Can I knock?
MATT: Yeah.

3077
02:36:03,976 --> 02:36:06,416
LAURA: Brother?
LIAM: What?

3078
02:36:06,416 --> 02:36:11,742
LAURA: Sorry. I don't mean to disturb you.
I just feel really guilty.

3079
02:36:11,742 --> 02:36:13,013
I just wanted to say sorry

3080
02:36:13,013 --> 02:36:15,351
for being mad at you
for being able to fly,

3081
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:18,046
because I'm actually
really impressed and proud of you,

3082
02:36:18,046 --> 02:36:19,446
and I'm glad you're not dead.

3083
02:36:19,446 --> 02:36:21,729
LAURA: Is all I wanted to say.
LIAM: I open the door, scratching my arm.

3084
02:36:21,729 --> 02:36:23,374
LAURA: What the fuck is wrong with you?

3085
02:36:23,374 --> 02:36:26,246
LIAM: I don't feel very well.
LAURA: You smell better.

3086
02:36:26,246 --> 02:36:29,620
LIAM: (sighs) I'm just
going to ignore that.

3087
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:35,290
Could you do me a favor,
if you really feel so special to me.

3088
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:39,042
Could you get Allura for me, maybe?
Send Allura to my room.

3089
02:36:39,042 --> 02:36:41,493
LAURA: I mean, yeah,
she's not in the castle, but I can find -

3090
02:36:41,493 --> 02:36:43,855
LIAM: Where does she - where is -
yeah, you've got a broom.

3091
02:36:43,855 --> 02:36:46,048
LIAM: Could you go fly over there?
LAURA: Yeah, no fucking -

3092
02:36:46,048 --> 02:36:47,939
LIAM: You can fly
as much as you want, all day.

3093
02:36:47,939 --> 02:36:49,977
LIAM: All day long, right?
LAURA: This is true.

3094
02:36:49,977 --> 02:36:52,509
LAURA: I will go find Allura for you

3095
02:36:52,509 --> 02:36:56,574
as an apology
for being a dick last night.

3096
02:36:56,574 --> 02:36:59,813
And I fly off
and I go try to find Allura.

3097
02:36:59,813 --> 02:37:02,604
MATT: You come to Allura's home -

3098
02:37:02,604 --> 02:37:07,376
LIAM: I go have diarrhea
in the chamber pot in my room.

3099
02:37:07,376 --> 02:37:08,613
MATT: Okay. Ugh.

3100
02:37:08,613 --> 02:37:10,533
TRAVIS: Talk to your daggers
while you do it.

3101
02:37:10,533 --> 02:37:13,031
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

3102
02:37:13,031 --> 02:37:17,358
MATT: You make your way back to the house
where Allura's been staying

3103
02:37:17,358 --> 02:37:18,905
and knock on the door.

3104
02:37:18,905 --> 02:37:21,863
Door opens. Kima's there.

3105
02:37:21,863 --> 02:37:24,261
LAURA: Oh. Hi, dear.

3106
02:37:24,261 --> 02:37:26,059
MATT: "Hi. You guys rest okay?
Everything all right?"

3107
02:37:26,059 --> 02:37:26,963
LAURA: Oh, yes -
MATT: "Any problems?"

3108
02:37:26,963 --> 02:37:28,578
MATT: She grabs her maul
from the side of the door.

3109
02:37:28,578 --> 02:37:31,067
LAURA: No, no, everything's great.
Is Allura in here, as well?

3110
02:37:31,067 --> 02:37:33,051
MATT: "Yeah, she's -
would you like some coffee?"

3111
02:37:33,051 --> 02:37:34,673
LAURA: I would love some.

3112
02:37:34,673 --> 02:37:36,642
MATT: As you come inside,
you can smell coffee brewing.

3113
02:37:36,642 --> 02:37:38,156
MARISHA: I've got time.

3114
02:37:38,156 --> 02:37:42,083
MATT: You see Allura
comes out of the kitchen area

3115
02:37:42,083 --> 02:37:43,631
of this home that she's staying in.

3116
02:37:43,631 --> 02:37:45,250
"Oh, hi!"

3117
02:37:45,250 --> 02:37:46,017
LAURA: Hi!

3118
02:37:46,017 --> 02:37:47,978
MATT: "I'll get another cup."

3119
02:37:47,978 --> 02:37:48,783
LAURA: Thank you.

3120
02:37:48,783 --> 02:37:49,748
MATT: And she leaves.

3121
02:37:49,748 --> 02:37:52,161
LIAM: Does she have
that beautiful but messy morning hair

3122
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:54,393
that takes two hours to prep for a movie?

3123
02:37:54,393 --> 02:37:56,776
MATT: Actually, no. Her hair is perfect.

3124
02:37:56,776 --> 02:37:59,013
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. I'm sure.
LAURA: Of course it is.

3125
02:37:59,013 --> 02:38:00,134
LIAM: Fucking wizards.

3126
02:38:00,134 --> 02:38:02,157
LAURA: Prestidigitation.

3127
02:38:02,157 --> 02:38:03,700
(all laugh)

3128
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:07,199
MARISHA: Fucking blow-outs
every morning.

3129
02:38:07,199 --> 02:38:09,082
MATT: No, she - yeah.
Way too well put together

3130
02:38:09,082 --> 02:38:11,570
for being this early 
in the conscious day.

3131
02:38:11,570 --> 02:38:13,492
LAURA: I look at Kima.
How the fuck does she do it?

3132
02:38:13,492 --> 02:38:15,182
MATT: "I know, you're telling me, right?"
LAURA: Right?

3133
02:38:15,182 --> 02:38:17,716
MATT: "It's obnoxious. (sighs)"

3134
02:38:17,716 --> 02:38:20,543
LIAM: (singing) I say bitch...
MARISHA: (cracks up)

3135
02:38:20,543 --> 02:38:22,030
MATT: She brings coffee back

3136
02:38:22,030 --> 02:38:28,687
and sets it in the center
of this serving table for guests.

3137
02:38:28,687 --> 02:38:33,335
You start drinking the coffee.
It's very well put on, nice and sweet.

3138
02:38:33,335 --> 02:38:35,130
"So, what -"

3139
02:38:35,130 --> 02:38:38,637
LAURA: Oh! I forgot.
I came here for a reason.

3140
02:38:38,637 --> 02:38:44,536
My brother is shaken up from last night,

3141
02:38:44,536 --> 02:38:51,198
and I think he might be
a little worried about -

3142
02:38:51,198 --> 02:38:52,728
I don't know, he sent me to find you.

3143
02:38:52,728 --> 02:38:55,707
I'm not exactly sure what's going on,
but he looked terrible,

3144
02:38:55,707 --> 02:38:59,245
and he thought
maybe you would be able to help?

3145
02:38:59,245 --> 02:39:00,747
MATT: "It was a very rough night."

3146
02:39:00,747 --> 02:39:05,220
LIAM: I mean, you're not a cleric, but -
I don't know,

3147
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:08,515
he seemed to think
he could use your help.

3148
02:39:08,515 --> 02:39:09,775
MATT: "Let's go have a look, then."

3149
02:39:09,775 --> 02:39:12,692
And so they go ahead
and they walk back with you.

3150
02:39:12,692 --> 02:39:14,601
LAURA: I'm going to catch up.
You get a head start.

3151
02:39:14,601 --> 02:39:15,993
I'm just going to get some more coffee.

3152
02:39:15,993 --> 02:39:19,387
MATT: (laughs) It's good coffee.

3153
02:39:27,517 --> 02:39:31,197
TRAVIS: You hear a whisper
from the coffee mug saying, "I own you."

3154
02:39:31,197 --> 02:39:33,352
(all laugh)

3155
02:39:33,352 --> 02:39:35,173
LAURA: I know you do, darling.
I know you do.

3156
02:39:35,173 --> 02:39:36,825
ASHLEY: You didn't perception check
the cup!

3157
02:39:36,825 --> 02:39:41,276
LIAM: Find my dominoes. They’re here.

3158
02:39:44,566 --> 02:39:46,666
ASHLEY: What's he looking up?
LAURA: I don't know.

3159
02:39:46,666 --> 02:39:49,361
MATT: Eventually,
you've found your way

3160
02:39:49,361 --> 02:39:56,178
wandering through the hall
to get some food, sunken sockets.

3161
02:39:56,178 --> 02:39:59,959
Grog passes by you in the hallway,

3162
02:39:59,959 --> 02:40:02,632
and you see Vax,
hand against the wall,

3163
02:40:02,632 --> 02:40:06,560
walking by,
looking dazed and a little weary.

3164
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,956
TRAVIS: You all right, mate?

3165
02:40:07,956 --> 02:40:09,246
LIAM: I've got the shits.

3166
02:40:09,246 --> 02:40:11,517
TRAVIS: Oh. Like, the shits or the twirls?

3167
02:40:11,517 --> 02:40:13,763
LIAM: Bad - what's the difference?

3168
02:40:13,763 --> 02:40:16,372
TRAVIS: The shits it's just one end,
the other, both.

3169
02:40:16,372 --> 02:40:19,259
North, south, all at the same time.
It's like a relay race.

3170
02:40:19,259 --> 02:40:21,444
LIAM: I know what you mean now. Yes.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3171
02:40:21,444 --> 02:40:27,004
LIAM: Well, I was just - you know,
I might be crossing that threshold.

3172
02:40:27,004 --> 02:40:28,035
And I jump into a side door -

3173
02:40:28,035 --> 02:40:28,845
MATT: Okay.

3174
02:40:28,845 --> 02:40:30,946
LIAM: - and send it out both sides.
Two exits, no waiting.

3175
02:40:30,946 --> 02:40:31,994
MATT: Oh.

3176
02:40:31,994 --> 02:40:35,277
TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, shit. Amazing.

3177
02:40:35,277 --> 02:40:37,401
ASHLEY: (dryly) Wow,
I've never heard of that.

3178
02:40:37,401 --> 02:40:39,808
MATT: You proudly hear,
through the doorway.

3179
02:40:39,808 --> 02:40:42,328
LIAM: This happened to me
when I was six, by the way.

3180
02:40:42,328 --> 02:40:45,022
I'm talking about Liam, not Vax.

3181
02:40:45,022 --> 02:40:47,708
TRAVIS: If you've had the twirls,
you never forget them.

3182
02:40:47,708 --> 02:40:53,704
MATT: All right. As time passes,
eventually your sister, Allura, and Kima

3183
02:40:53,704 --> 02:40:56,607
make their way towards you
to go ahead and check in.

3184
02:40:56,607 --> 02:40:58,514
LAURA: Is he still in the toilet
or did he get out yet?

3185
02:40:58,514 --> 02:41:00,725
MATT: He's made his way out.
LAURA: Okay.

3186
02:41:00,725 --> 02:41:03,619
MATT: Allura takes a look at you.

3187
02:41:03,619 --> 02:41:06,257
"You certainly don't look well."

3188
02:41:06,257 --> 02:41:09,816
LIAM: (hoarsely) I'm having really bad -
I had bad dreams all night long.

3189
02:41:09,816 --> 02:41:13,163
I relived the moment from last night

3190
02:41:13,163 --> 02:41:17,680
and I've got really bad...
bathroom etiquette.

3191
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:20,944
MATT: "It might be
lingering enchantment from the robe.

3192
02:41:20,944 --> 02:41:21,923
"Let me try something."

3193
02:41:21,923 --> 02:41:23,010
And she pulls back

3194
02:41:23,010 --> 02:41:27,373
and thumbs mentally
through some sort of index in her head

3195
02:41:27,373 --> 02:41:29,473
and brings her hand up.

3196
02:41:29,473 --> 02:41:31,390
"Eras to no est."

3197
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:34,261
And begins drawing
this strange glyph in the air,

3198
02:41:34,261 --> 02:41:38,668
that where her finger traces,
you can see a slight sparkle falls behind

3199
02:41:38,668 --> 02:41:42,081
before it forges some sort of a letter
that you don't recognize,

3200
02:41:42,081 --> 02:41:44,468
and it passes through you (foomf),

3201
02:41:44,468 --> 02:41:48,288
and as it gets through, you can't help
but to get pushed back for a second.

3202
02:41:50,358 --> 02:41:52,308
"Do you feel any different?"

3203
02:41:52,308 --> 02:41:54,948
LIAM: (fart noise)

3204
02:41:54,948 --> 02:41:56,924
MATT: No change,
from what you can tell.

3205
02:41:56,924 --> 02:41:59,366
Still just... bad place.

3206
02:41:59,366 --> 02:42:04,779
LIAM: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
(sighs) I'm new to this, but -

3207
02:42:04,779 --> 02:42:09,285
Can I cast Lay on Hands on myself?

3208
02:42:09,285 --> 02:42:10,435
MATT: Yeah.

3209
02:42:10,435 --> 02:42:11,841
LIAM: Pray to my god.

3210
02:42:11,841 --> 02:42:18,490
It's the worst. Can you help?

3211
02:42:22,460 --> 02:42:24,239
MATT: The effect hits

3212
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:28,120
and intends to remove any poison,
disease circumstance.

3213
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:30,706
No change in physical presence.

3214
02:42:30,706 --> 02:42:33,493
LIAM: (whispering) Fuck.
ASHLEY: (whispering) What the fuck?

3215
02:42:33,493 --> 02:42:35,068
MATT: "Kima, have you any ideas?"

3216
02:42:35,068 --> 02:42:37,620
"Here! Let me have a look at you."

3217
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:41,889
She pulls you down to her position,
just pushing your eyelids open.

3218
02:42:41,889 --> 02:42:43,892
TRAVIS: Yeah, be very thorough.

3219
02:42:45,762 --> 02:42:47,435
MATT: "Grog, do you
want to help me with this?"

3220
02:42:47,435 --> 02:42:49,793
TRAVIS: Yep, absolutely.
Open your mouth, stick out your tongue.

3221
02:42:49,793 --> 02:42:51,312
LIAM: You're not
going to slip me the digit, are you?

3222
02:42:51,312 --> 02:42:53,560
TRAVIS: Stick out your tongue!
MATT: "I'm not going to."

3223
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:55,954
TRAVIS: I grab his tongue.
LIAM: Aaah!

3224
02:42:55,954 --> 02:42:58,600
TRAVIS: Kima, you see anything in there?
Any bumps? Mumps?

3225
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:02,037
LIAM: (groans)
MATT: "Just seems tired to me."

3226
02:43:02,037 --> 02:43:03,262
TRAVIS: Pull his tongue a little bit more.

3227
02:43:03,262 --> 02:43:06,213
LIAM: Aaah! (garbled) Grog!
TRAVIS: I release, I release.

3228
02:43:06,213 --> 02:43:08,446
LIAM: Ohhh, fuck.

3229
02:43:08,446 --> 02:43:10,006
ASHLEY: Can I wake up
and come out into the hallway?

3230
02:43:10,006 --> 02:43:11,453
MARISHA: I'll join Pike.

3231
02:43:11,453 --> 02:43:13,106
MATT: You guys walk out

3232
02:43:13,106 --> 02:43:16,876
and see as Allura sits back
with a slight chuckle next to Vex,

3233
02:43:16,876 --> 02:43:21,577
as you see both Grog and Kima
manhandling a very exhausted-looking Vax

3234
02:43:21,577 --> 02:43:22,689
in the center of the hallway.

3235
02:43:22,689 --> 02:43:24,265
LIAM: Oh, it's funny to you, eh?

3236
02:43:24,265 --> 02:43:25,579
ASHLEY: What are you guys looking for?

3237
02:43:25,579 --> 02:43:26,853
TRAVIS: Oh, Vax doesn't feel well.

3238
02:43:26,853 --> 02:43:29,032
He shit and puked
all over the area in the back.

3239
02:43:29,032 --> 02:43:31,807
MARISHA: Oh no!
ASHLEY: Can I check him?

3240
02:43:31,807 --> 02:43:33,267
MARISHA: Was it the crab cakes?

3241
02:43:33,267 --> 02:43:34,638
LIAM: I didn't have those.

3242
02:43:34,638 --> 02:43:37,194
MATT: You want to make a Medicine check?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3243
02:43:37,194 --> 02:43:38,586
TALIESIN: I ate them, and I was fine.

3244
02:43:38,586 --> 02:43:40,369
MARISHA: Really?
The crab cakes messed with me a little.

3245
02:43:40,369 --> 02:43:44,932
SAM: I'm reading this whole time.
Just reading and reading.

3246
02:43:44,932 --> 02:43:48,028
MATT: You hear this echo in the distance
of him shitting himself.

3247
02:43:48,028 --> 02:43:49,844
And you're like, "eh."

3248
02:43:49,844 --> 02:43:51,127
ASHLEY: 23.

3249
02:43:51,127 --> 02:43:56,251
MATT: 23. You push Kima aside
and take a very intense look at his body.

3250
02:43:56,251 --> 02:43:57,809
ASHLEY: Move aside, move aside, move aside.

3251
02:43:57,809 --> 02:43:59,346
MATT: "Oh."

3252
02:43:59,346 --> 02:44:04,488
Very intense look over.

3253
02:44:04,488 --> 02:44:08,219
Physically, there does not appear
to be any ailment to him, whatsoever.

3254
02:44:08,219 --> 02:44:11,627
There are traces of exhaustion in him,

3255
02:44:11,627 --> 02:44:16,347
and you do have a point of exhaustion,
by the way, for a lack of evening's rest.

3256
02:44:16,347 --> 02:44:20,972
But there's no signs
of onset of splotchiness or diseases.

3257
02:44:20,972 --> 02:44:24,517
There's no pulsing
or darkened vein marks.

3258
02:44:24,517 --> 02:44:26,499
Nothing physical.

3259
02:44:29,179 --> 02:44:30,734
ASHLEY: No poison?

3260
02:44:30,734 --> 02:44:32,769
MARISHA: What did you try on him, Pike?

3261
02:44:32,769 --> 02:44:34,274
ASHLEY: Medicine check.

3262
02:44:34,274 --> 02:44:36,527
LAURA: Are you cursed? Is he cursed?

3263
02:44:38,247 --> 02:44:42,339
MARISHA: I go up to Vax.
Does he still have the brooch on?

3264
02:44:42,339 --> 02:44:45,707
MATT: The brooch
that was given to him by Percy.

3265
02:44:45,707 --> 02:44:47,489
MARISHA: I look at it.
MATT: Okay.

3266
02:44:47,489 --> 02:44:51,561
TALIESIN: I can tell you what is in there.
It's nothing fancy.

3267
02:44:51,561 --> 02:44:52,597
TRAVIS: You're killing him.

3268
02:44:52,597 --> 02:44:54,046
MARISHA: Is this the skull I gave you?

3269
02:44:54,046 --> 02:44:57,814
TALIESIN: Well, it's a cast of -
the skull you gave me is still in my bag.

3270
02:44:57,814 --> 02:44:59,859
MARISHA: You cast it? Wow.
TALIESIN: I did.

3271
02:44:59,859 --> 02:45:01,147
MARISHA: That's impressive.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3272
02:45:01,147 --> 02:45:04,108
LAURA: My brother, puking his guts out.
MARISHA: Sorry.

3273
02:45:04,108 --> 02:45:06,073
LIAM: Not right now (retch).

3274
02:45:06,073 --> 02:45:09,529
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
MARISHA: Ooh. Allura, what did you try?

3275
02:45:09,529 --> 02:45:11,748
TALIESIN: Did he just throw up everywhere?

3276
02:45:11,748 --> 02:45:13,155
LIAM: No, I stopped it.

3277
02:45:13,155 --> 02:45:14,879
LIAM: (moans)
TALIESIN: Let it out. Let it out.

3278
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:16,041
MATT: "I attempted to dispel,

3279
02:45:16,041 --> 02:45:21,867
"in case there was any spell
that was still sustained on him."

3280
02:45:21,867 --> 02:45:23,634
MARISHA: Kima, did you try Restoration?

3281
02:45:23,634 --> 02:45:25,115
MATT: Kima goes,

3282
02:45:25,115 --> 02:45:29,595
"Not really my specialty
at the moment. My apologies."

3283
02:45:29,595 --> 02:45:31,798
ASHLEY: I'll do it. I'll do it.

3284
02:45:31,798 --> 02:45:33,970
MARISHA: I've got
Greater Restoration learned.

3285
02:45:33,970 --> 02:45:36,457
ASHLEY: We could try.

3286
02:45:36,457 --> 02:45:39,062
MARISHA: Pike and I will tag-team
a Greater Restoration.

3287
02:45:39,062 --> 02:45:39,971
MATT: All righty.

3288
02:45:39,971 --> 02:45:41,239
LIAM: (groans)

3289
02:45:43,639 --> 02:45:46,075
TRAVIS: Percy, if you're feeling gross,
you can imagine -

3290
02:45:46,075 --> 02:45:48,489
go examine the leftovers over there.

3291
02:45:48,489 --> 02:45:50,451
TALIESIN: Is there some vomit
in the corner?

3292
02:45:50,451 --> 02:45:52,795
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. Just make sure
you crawl in on your hands and knees.

3293
02:45:52,795 --> 02:45:54,486
TALIESIN: I'm going to go poke at it

3294
02:45:54,486 --> 02:45:56,220
just to see if there's anything in there
that looks funny.

3295
02:45:56,220 --> 02:45:57,329
LIAM: Only some of it is vomit.

3296
02:45:57,329 --> 02:46:00,222
TALIESIN: I'm well-aware.
I have siblings, I've seen this before.

3297
02:46:00,222 --> 02:46:01,414
LIAM: (laughs)

3298
02:46:01,414 --> 02:46:03,725
MATT: And so as Percy has wandered off
at this time,

3299
02:46:03,725 --> 02:46:07,621
you guys both hold hands and channel,
through both of your abilities,

3300
02:46:07,621 --> 02:46:09,552
the Greater Restoration spell.

3301
02:46:09,552 --> 02:46:12,707
Suddenly,
you feel like this dark hook

3302
02:46:12,707 --> 02:46:15,320
that was in the center of your being
is lifted.

3303
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:18,887
And as it dissipates,
you're still exhausted,

3304
02:46:18,887 --> 02:46:21,497
and still lost
an entire evening's worth of rest,

3305
02:46:21,497 --> 02:46:25,500
but whatever was keeping you
in that nightmarish realm of stasis

3306
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:27,311
seems to have been dispelled.

3307
02:46:27,311 --> 02:46:28,895
LIAM: How's my intestines?

3308
02:46:28,895 --> 02:46:31,626
MATT: Better. Tired.

3309
02:46:31,626 --> 02:46:35,014
Your midsection is very sore
from the constant flexing.

3310
02:46:35,014 --> 02:46:37,140
MARISHA: Did Pike and I notice anything

3311
02:46:37,140 --> 02:46:39,903
when we ripped out this darkness
from his chest?

3312
02:46:39,903 --> 02:46:42,295
MATT: You gather
that there was some curse

3313
02:46:42,295 --> 02:46:43,593
that had taken hold of his body.

3314
02:46:43,593 --> 02:46:46,666
LAURA: Ah! He was cursed.
ASHLEY: Yeah, he was cursed.

3315
02:46:46,666 --> 02:46:48,693
MARISHA: Like, by the rakshasa, probably?

3316
02:46:48,693 --> 02:46:50,216
MATT: You gather,

3317
02:46:50,216 --> 02:46:52,360
probably something to do
with the rakshasa, yeah.

3318
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:54,438
LAURA: Grog, can I have your jug
for a moment?

3319
02:46:54,438 --> 02:46:56,294
TRAVIS: Why?
LAURA: I just want to get some water.

3320
02:46:56,294 --> 02:46:58,827
TRAVIS: What kind of water?
LAURA: Regular-ass water.

3321
02:46:58,827 --> 02:47:01,836
TRAVIS: I'll do it.
LAURA: Not ass-water. Just regular water.

3322
02:47:01,836 --> 02:47:04,435
TRAVIS: Could I have
some ass-water, please?

3323
02:47:04,435 --> 02:47:06,964
LAURA: No, no. Just regular water, Grog.
ASHLEY: No, Grog.

3324
02:47:06,964 --> 02:47:09,202
TRAVIS: Regular water, please?

3325
02:47:09,202 --> 02:47:13,334
MATT: Jug fills up with clear, cool water.

3326
02:47:13,334 --> 02:47:15,107
LAURA: Drink this.
LIAM: All of it?!

3327
02:47:15,107 --> 02:47:16,034
LAURA: Yeah.

3328
02:47:16,034 --> 02:47:18,592
LIAM: Are you sure
that won't make me throw up, as well?

3329
02:47:18,592 --> 02:47:22,078
LAURA: You're very dehydrated, seriously.
ASHLEY: As much as you can.

3330
02:47:22,078 --> 02:47:25,944
TALIESIN: There's no signs of poisoning
in any of the remains, is there?

3331
02:47:25,944 --> 02:47:27,079
LIAM: (gulping sounds)

3332
02:47:27,079 --> 02:47:28,518
MATT: No. In fact,

3333
02:47:28,518 --> 02:47:34,422
you spend probably a good 3 to 4 minutes
pushing through Vax refuse

3334
02:47:34,422 --> 02:47:37,780
while nobody else has thought
to actually come and stop you

3335
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:39,384
when they've already figured out
what the problem was.

3336
02:47:39,384 --> 02:47:40,365
TALIESIN: That's fine.

3337
02:47:40,365 --> 02:47:41,351
MARISHA: Hey, Percy!

3338
02:47:41,351 --> 02:47:43,520
TRAVIS: He still feels bad, keep looking!
MARISHA: Hey, Percy, you find anything?

3339
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:45,632
MARISHA: Sorry, haven't found 
anything yet, Percy.

3340
02:47:45,632 --> 02:47:47,492
Keep going. It might be clues.

3341
02:47:47,492 --> 02:47:50,143
TALIESIN: It will take -
if I don't see anything in 3 minutes -

3342
02:47:50,143 --> 02:47:50,906
MATT: Roll a medicine check.

3343
02:47:50,906 --> 02:47:52,912
(all laugh)

3344
02:47:52,912 --> 02:47:56,502
TALIESIN: Awful people.

3345
02:47:56,502 --> 02:47:59,502
That's a 14.

3346
02:47:59,502 --> 02:48:00,894
TRAVIS: Find a toy car...

3347
02:48:00,894 --> 02:48:03,815
MATT: It seems
fairly standard bile and excrement.

3348
02:48:03,815 --> 02:48:05,867
TALIESIN: Nothing, nothing, no poison.

3349
02:48:05,867 --> 02:48:08,259
MARISHA: Find anything, Percy?
TALIESIN: (annoyed) No.

3350
02:48:08,259 --> 02:48:10,442
MARISHA: Oh.
Maybe you should keep looking.

3351
02:48:10,442 --> 02:48:12,071
MATT: No signs of parasites, nothing.

3352
02:48:12,071 --> 02:48:14,964
LIAM: Are there any feathers?
LAURA: Percival!

3353
02:48:14,964 --> 02:48:16,041
MATT: There is one feather.

3354
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:19,907
MARISHA: Do a litmus test.
Is it basic or acid? We don't know.

3355
02:48:19,907 --> 02:48:21,844
LAURA: Percival, stop. He was cursed.

3356
02:48:21,844 --> 02:48:25,382
TALIESIN: I can actually have everybody
killed in their sleep.

3357
02:48:25,382 --> 02:48:28,552
This is actually one of the perks
of sleeping here.

3358
02:48:28,552 --> 02:48:30,351
I don't even have to do it myself.

3359
02:48:31,664 --> 02:48:33,515
I come out and I'm -

3360
02:48:33,515 --> 02:48:35,932
TRAVIS: Are you done with the jug?
Can I have that back, please?

3361
02:48:35,932 --> 02:48:36,978
TALIESIN: (shudders)

3362
02:48:36,978 --> 02:48:40,482
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3363
02:48:43,152 --> 02:48:46,424
LIAM: Grog, does that thing make mimosas?
LAURA: Oh!

3364
02:48:46,424 --> 02:48:47,690
MARISHA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Mimosas?

3365
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:49,055
LAURA: Or Bloody Marys?
TALIESIN: Mimosas.

3366
02:48:49,055 --> 02:48:53,123
TRAVIS: Well, there's one way 
to find out. Mimosas, please.

3367
02:48:54,593 --> 02:48:56,137
MATT: No effect.
TRAVIS: Shit.

3368
02:48:56,137 --> 02:48:57,609
LAURA: Ask for Bloody Marys. Bloody Marys.

3369
02:48:57,609 --> 02:48:59,381
TRAVIS: Bloody Marys, please.

3370
02:49:00,611 --> 02:49:01,900
MATT: No effect.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

3371
02:49:01,900 --> 02:49:03,888
LAURA: Does it not work anymore?
Ask for mayonnaise.

3372
02:49:03,888 --> 02:49:06,013
TRAVIS: Look, you put
a lot of stress on it, all right?

3373
02:49:06,013 --> 02:49:08,491
It made your ass-water just fine.

3374
02:49:08,491 --> 02:49:10,096
ASHLEY: Can you ask for some ale?

3375
02:49:10,096 --> 02:49:12,690
TRAVIS: No, I think it only works
for a little bit every day.

3376
02:49:12,690 --> 02:49:13,986
LAURA: Aw.

3377
02:49:13,986 --> 02:49:15,130
TRAVIS: You could try it.

3378
02:49:15,130 --> 02:49:17,713
ASHLEY: Ale?

3379
02:49:17,713 --> 02:49:19,277
LAURA: Please.

3380
02:49:19,277 --> 02:49:21,856
MATT: (fwssh) Fills with dark ale.

3381
02:49:21,856 --> 02:49:24,304
TRAVIS: Holy shit, you're magic!
MARISHA: Oh, we just found a loophole!

3382
02:49:24,304 --> 02:49:26,607
LAURA: Good job!
TRAVIS: (laughing) Monster magic!

3383
02:49:26,607 --> 02:49:29,097
ASHLEY: I drink some
and then pass it over.

3384
02:49:29,097 --> 02:49:30,561
SAM: Does it make mixed drinks?

3385
02:49:30,561 --> 02:49:32,172
TALIESIN: We hardly can make cocktails.

3386
02:49:32,172 --> 02:49:35,343
LAURA: Oh, that's probably bad for you
right now, but that's all right.

3387
02:49:35,343 --> 02:49:38,687
TALIESIN: No, this breakfast beer
is perfectly reasonable.

3388
02:49:38,687 --> 02:49:40,281
MARISHA: It needs to go
to a bartending class.

3389
02:49:40,281 --> 02:49:42,124
ASHLEY: Hair of the wolf.

3390
02:49:42,124 --> 02:49:45,026
TALIESIN: His face touched that.
I'm just dipping in.

3391
02:49:45,026 --> 02:49:47,358
LIAM: So studious.
TRAVIS: Oh, you're reading.

3392
02:49:47,358 --> 02:49:49,028
MATT: At this point,
you hear a guard's voice shout,

3393
02:49:49,028 --> 02:49:52,443
"Hail, Vox Machina!
Downstairs, please."

3394
02:49:52,443 --> 02:49:53,559
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

3395
02:49:53,559 --> 02:49:54,853
TRAVIS: We did your - give me the jug.

3396
02:49:54,853 --> 02:49:58,004
Don't you fucking hold onto that, Percy,
you give it back right now.

3397
02:49:58,004 --> 02:50:01,000
(all laugh)

3398
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,427
TALIESIN: I take one more big sip
and toss it at him.

3399
02:50:02,427 --> 02:50:04,294
LIAM: Oh, catch it!
TRAVIS: I catch it.

3400
02:50:04,294 --> 02:50:05,945
MATT: Scanlan,
are you still reading this morning?

3401
02:50:05,945 --> 02:50:08,787
SAM: I mean, I'd tell everyone,

3402
02:50:08,787 --> 02:50:11,055
"Call me if it's important.
I've got to do this."

3403
02:50:11,055 --> 02:50:12,743
MATT: Okay.
Did you get a full night's rest, though?

3404
02:50:12,743 --> 02:50:13,616
SAM: I did.

3405
02:50:13,616 --> 02:50:15,319
MATT: Okay, yeah,
so your exhaustion point is gone.

3406
02:50:15,319 --> 02:50:17,828
All right. So you guys head downstairs.

3407
02:50:17,828 --> 02:50:18,910
TRAVIS: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

3408
02:50:18,910 --> 02:50:21,661
MATT: As you get there,
the front gates to Whitestone castle -

3409
02:50:21,661 --> 02:50:23,739
no, the front doors
to the main entranceway

3410
02:50:23,739 --> 02:50:25,957
are partially open
and the guards are waiting there

3411
02:50:25,957 --> 02:50:30,547
as you see a shadow step in
from the outside daylight.

3412
02:50:30,547 --> 02:50:32,598
LAURA: It's a guy?

3413
02:50:32,598 --> 02:50:35,766
MARISHA: I light up my hands in defense.

3414
02:50:35,766 --> 02:50:38,043
MATT: You see step inside
to the center of the castle,

3415
02:50:38,043 --> 02:50:44,114
a very large, dark-furred wolf
carrying something within his jaws.

3416
02:50:44,114 --> 02:50:45,349
TRAVIS: Good boy.

3417
02:50:45,349 --> 02:50:50,093
MATT: Drops down on the ground
another dark-cloaked figure.

3418
02:50:50,093 --> 02:50:51,770
MARISHA: Is he still alive?

3419
02:50:51,770 --> 02:50:53,476
MATT: He is not alive.

3420
02:50:53,476 --> 02:50:54,616
There is a snapped neck
on this individual.

3421
02:50:54,616 --> 02:50:55,760
LAURA: Good job!

3422
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:57,535
MATT: You can see a series of scrapes
across the face.

3423
02:50:57,535 --> 02:50:59,434
This person, as you go and inspect,

3424
02:50:59,434 --> 02:51:01,783
had been rushing quickly
through the forest

3425
02:51:01,783 --> 02:51:06,091
and had taken a number of small injuries
in the haste to escape.

3426
02:51:06,091 --> 02:51:09,207
However, could not escape
the ever-watching vigil.

3427
02:51:09,207 --> 02:51:10,635
ASHLEY: Ah!
LAURA: Fuck, yeah.

3428
02:51:10,635 --> 02:51:12,529
TRAVIS: I mean, we might as well
let him keep his prize.

3429
02:51:12,529 --> 02:51:13,923
TALIESIN: Oh, it's all his.

3430
02:51:13,923 --> 02:51:16,967
Check the body for bits
and then the rest is his.

3431
02:51:16,967 --> 02:51:19,392
LAURA: I want to check the body
to see if I can find anything useful.

3432
02:51:19,392 --> 02:51:20,534
MATT: Okay, yeah.

3433
02:51:20,534 --> 02:51:23,710
You actually find about 320 gold pieces
on the body.

3434
02:51:23,710 --> 02:51:26,440
SAM: Did we inspect
any of the other bodies?

3435
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:27,422
MARISHA: No, we didn't.

3436
02:51:27,422 --> 02:51:29,539
LAURA: There was a lot going on.

3437
02:51:29,539 --> 02:51:34,074
MATT: You find 6 vials of poison.

3438
02:51:34,074 --> 02:51:36,195
LAURA: Whoa.
LIAM: Give that shit to me.

3439
02:51:36,195 --> 02:51:38,270
SAM: What kind? Just poison?
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

3440
02:51:38,270 --> 02:51:41,100
MATT: You're not too familiar
with poisons.

3441
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:42,586
Vax would be.
He could have a look at it.

3442
02:51:42,586 --> 02:51:45,147
LAURA: And you said 300 gold?

3443
02:51:45,147 --> 02:51:47,054
TRAVIS: 320.
MATT: 300 gold.

3444
02:51:47,054 --> 02:51:51,846
MATT: And you find what looks to be
a fist-sized glass sphere.

3445
02:51:51,846 --> 02:51:54,436
LAURA: A what-sized glass sphere?
MARISHA: Glass sphere?

3446
02:51:54,436 --> 02:51:55,716
MATT: Fist-sized glass sphere, 
about that big.

3447
02:51:55,716 --> 02:51:59,003
TALIESIN: It might be a gazing sphere.
Be careful. Keep it under cover.

3448
02:51:59,003 --> 02:52:00,144
Keep it wrapped in something.

3449
02:52:00,144 --> 02:52:03,022
LIAM: I want to walk out
towards our beast here

3450
02:52:03,022 --> 02:52:05,119
and hold out my hand.

3451
02:52:07,599 --> 02:52:13,705
MATT: He walks up to you. (sniffs)
Smells your hand, and steps into it.

3452
02:52:13,705 --> 02:52:16,743
He head-butts the palm of your hand
and then runs his head under it.

3453
02:52:16,743 --> 02:52:18,584
ASHLEY: Oh. Percy, can I touch him?

3454
02:52:18,584 --> 02:52:19,616
MATT: There's a familiar scent.

3455
02:52:19,616 --> 02:52:23,830
You can see
there's an immediate familiarity with you

3456
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:25,660
that wasn't there before.

3457
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:28,479
LAURA: Oh, it's the Raven Queen.
Her champion.

3458
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:31,868
LIAM: I just scrooch under his giant neck.

3459
02:52:34,678 --> 02:52:36,536
You want to be friends with me?

3460
02:52:36,536 --> 02:52:41,218
MATT: You can see the eyes,
dark and piercing into you.

3461
02:52:41,218 --> 02:52:43,049
"(grunts)"

3462
02:52:43,049 --> 02:52:47,309
LIAM: You be strong, I'll be fast.

3463
02:52:47,309 --> 02:52:49,989
You be strong and fast.
I'll be fast.

3464
02:52:53,729 --> 02:52:55,956
(shooka shooka shooka)

3465
02:52:55,956 --> 02:52:58,496
TRAVIS: Go give him a pet, Pike.

3466
02:52:58,496 --> 02:53:00,742
ASHLEY: Can I put my hand out to him?

3467
02:53:00,742 --> 02:53:02,627
MATT: He glances towards you.

3468
02:53:02,627 --> 02:53:04,632
LIAM: She's all right. She's all right.

3469
02:53:04,632 --> 02:53:07,296
MATT: You put your hand out?

3470
02:53:07,296 --> 02:53:08,186
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3471
02:53:08,186 --> 02:53:09,529
MATT: "(sniff sniff)"
He sniffs your hand.

3472
02:53:09,529 --> 02:53:13,043
MATT: "(snorts)"
ASHLEY: Oh!

3473
02:53:13,043 --> 02:53:15,630
ASHLEY: Can I try scratching at his ear?

3474
02:53:15,630 --> 02:53:18,520
MATT: You do,
and he seems to begrudgingly give into it.

3475
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:20,783
ASHLEY: (laughs) I go,

3476
02:53:20,783 --> 02:53:21,642
"Ohhh."

3477
02:53:21,642 --> 02:53:24,235
(all laugh)

3478
02:53:24,235 --> 02:53:25,576
ASHLEY: I love him.
TRAVIS: Sourpuss.

3479
02:53:25,576 --> 02:53:29,847
LAURA: Can I check out the sphere
that I'm looking at?

3480
02:53:29,847 --> 02:53:35,212
TRAVIS: Baldrick, thank you.
You are free to do with this as you will.

3481
02:53:35,212 --> 02:53:39,025
MATT: "(grunt, chomp)"

3482
02:53:39,025 --> 02:53:44,260
He picks it up in his jaws again
and starts walking outside.

3483
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:49,182
Spits it on the outside of the grounds,
rolling off the edge.

3484
02:53:49,182 --> 02:53:50,946
It doesn't go completely off,

3485
02:53:50,946 --> 02:53:53,022
but one of the legs
is dangling off the side,

3486
02:53:53,022 --> 02:53:56,090
and the guards wait there,
then take it and pull it away.

3487
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:58,030
The wolf's not going to eat
the dead body.

3488
02:53:58,030 --> 02:54:00,724
But it's done. He's done his job.

3489
02:54:00,724 --> 02:54:03,594
He takes it out of the castle,
gets it out of your way,

3490
02:54:03,594 --> 02:54:08,796
and then begins to step back down
the walkway path south of the castle,

3491
02:54:08,796 --> 02:54:11,959
making his way back towards Whitestone
and the surrounding forest.

3492
02:54:11,959 --> 02:54:13,775
TALIESIN: Good boy. Good boy.

3493
02:54:13,775 --> 02:54:15,825
LAURA: I shake it.

3494
02:54:15,825 --> 02:54:17,889
MATT: You shake it.
You actually look inside.

3495
02:54:17,889 --> 02:54:19,944
There's a cloudy liquid 
at the center of it.

3496
02:54:19,944 --> 02:54:23,900
When it was at rest,
it had no real motion,

3497
02:54:23,900 --> 02:54:25,837
but as you shake it,
it swirls on the inside.

3498
02:54:25,837 --> 02:54:27,145
LAURA: Oh, shit!
I made something happen.

3499
02:54:27,145 --> 02:54:29,061
LIAM: Bloop. Outlook shady.

3500
02:54:29,061 --> 02:54:31,354
MATT: (laughs)

3501
02:54:31,354 --> 02:54:33,234
MARISHA: You found a magic 8-ball!

3502
02:54:33,234 --> 02:54:37,041
TRAVIS: Signs point to yes.
LIAM: (laughs)

3503
02:54:37,041 --> 02:54:39,838
TALIESIN: We'll stop by Gilmore's
on our way back up to the front hall.

3504
02:54:39,838 --> 02:54:42,775
LAURA: Allura, do you know what this is?

3505
02:54:42,775 --> 02:54:44,567
MATT: She takes a look at it.

3506
02:54:47,167 --> 02:54:50,142
There's a little sparkle
of arcane energy in her eyes again.

3507
02:54:50,142 --> 02:54:51,678
You're starting to get the theme here.

3508
02:54:51,678 --> 02:54:54,608
There is a specific spell that she's using
to identify these objects.

3509
02:54:54,608 --> 02:54:55,808
You've seen it done before.

3510
02:54:55,808 --> 02:54:57,919
She takes a look at it and goes,

3511
02:54:57,919 --> 02:55:00,129
"Well, I can see
why this would be very useful

3512
02:55:00,129 --> 02:55:01,679
"for a member of the Clasp.

3513
02:55:01,679 --> 02:55:02,903
"It's a Scrying Eye."

3514
02:55:02,903 --> 02:55:04,337
MATT: And she throws it back to you.
LAURA: (gasps)

3515
02:55:04,337 --> 02:55:06,026
MARISHA: It's a scry - what?

3516
02:55:06,026 --> 02:55:07,393
LIAM AND SAM: A Scrying Eye.
LAURA: A Scrying Eye?

3517
02:55:07,393 --> 02:55:09,015
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Sure.

3518
02:55:09,015 --> 02:55:11,268
MATT: When you take, essentially,
10 minutes to focus on the eye,

3519
02:55:11,268 --> 02:55:12,875
you can scry as per the spell.

3520
02:55:12,875 --> 02:55:16,474
But it can only be used for 10 minutes
and it cannot be used until the next dawn.

3521
02:55:16,474 --> 02:55:18,962
MARISHA: Can it be used by anybody?

3522
02:55:18,962 --> 02:55:22,961
MATT: Well, in theory. 
You'll have to find out.

3523
02:55:22,961 --> 02:55:24,429
TALIESIN: And what can it see, precisely?

3524
02:55:24,429 --> 02:55:25,762
LAURA: This fist-sized glass sphere -

3525
02:55:25,762 --> 02:55:28,065
MATT: Anything a scrying spell could.
MARISHA: It works like scrying.

3526
02:55:28,065 --> 02:55:31,810
LAURA: You can scry...
Oh, you can scry for anything.

3527
02:55:31,810 --> 02:55:33,292
MATT: As per the spell. Once per day.

3528
02:55:33,292 --> 02:55:35,836
LIAM: What she does to waste a spell,
you can do as a freebie.

3529
02:55:35,836 --> 02:55:37,635
And you're so nosy,
so it's perfect for you.

3530
02:55:37,635 --> 02:55:39,740
LAURA: It actually is really perfect.

3531
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:42,183
TALIESIN: That's disquieting. Excellent.

3532
02:55:42,183 --> 02:55:44,932
LAURA: I really, really like this thing.

3533
02:55:44,932 --> 02:55:48,004
MATT: You can see Allura.
Her face gets a little stern at this.

3534
02:55:48,004 --> 02:55:51,119
"This is precisely the issue
we have here.

3535
02:55:51,119 --> 02:55:53,834
"If they could scry information,
anyone can.

3536
02:55:53,834 --> 02:55:56,678
"Which is why
I'm going to get with Gilmore

3537
02:55:56,678 --> 02:56:00,122
"and go and get together with the rest
of the arcane minds here in Whitestone,

3538
02:56:00,122 --> 02:56:02,848
"and we're going to try to ward this place
from any sort of intrusion.

3539
02:56:02,848 --> 02:56:08,148
"If possible, I'd like to blanket
this entire area with illusion.

3540
02:56:08,148 --> 02:56:13,296
"I'd like it so those who should not know
that Whitestone even exists do not."

3541
02:56:13,296 --> 02:56:15,383
LIAM: Is there anything we can do to help?

3542
02:56:15,383 --> 02:56:18,002
MATT: "Honestly, do what you're doing.

3543
02:56:18,002 --> 02:56:21,466
"Although, I may need some aid
from you, there."

3544
02:56:21,466 --> 02:56:23,304
And she looks towards you, Pike,
and says,

3545
02:56:23,304 --> 02:56:26,563
"If we're going to find out
where this rakshasa is

3546
02:56:26,563 --> 02:56:29,543
"and how to head it off at the pass
in the coming weeks,

3547
02:56:29,543 --> 02:56:33,082
"I think your divine nature
would be of great aid.

3548
02:56:33,082 --> 02:56:35,495
"You and Keeper Yennan.
Between the two of you,

3549
02:56:35,495 --> 02:56:39,400
"I think we could map out
a plot to head it off at the pass,

3550
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:44,315
"and when you return and are ready,
head into the hells ourselves

3551
02:56:44,315 --> 02:56:46,435
"and take it down 
while there's still time."

3552
02:56:46,435 --> 02:56:50,297
ASHLEY: I would be glad to help.
MATT: "All right."

3553
02:56:51,807 --> 02:56:56,735
ASHLEY: It's okay.
I can come back to you guys at any time.

3554
02:56:56,735 --> 02:56:57,845
LIAM: What do you mean?

3555
02:56:57,845 --> 02:56:59,626
MARISHA: But you're so important, Pike.

3556
02:56:59,626 --> 02:57:03,515
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know.
MARISHA: We tend to need you a lot.

3557
02:57:03,515 --> 02:57:07,105
LAURA: We can give her one of the stones.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3558
02:57:07,105 --> 02:57:13,381
ASHLEY: Any time you need me.
(laughs) Ish. I will try to be there.

3559
02:57:13,381 --> 02:57:15,749
LAURA: (laughs)
LIAM: Here. You take this.

3560
02:57:15,749 --> 02:57:18,447
ASHLEY: A sending stone?

3561
02:57:18,447 --> 02:57:20,469
LIAM: Should you need us.
LAURA: Yeah, should you need us.

3562
02:57:20,469 --> 02:57:21,489
ASHLEY: Oh.

3563
02:57:21,489 --> 02:57:23,198
MARISHA: I have the other one, currently.

3564
02:57:23,198 --> 02:57:26,456
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll keep this with me.
MARISHA: Okay.

3565
02:57:26,456 --> 02:57:27,428
ASHLEY: Okay.

3566
02:57:27,428 --> 02:57:29,402
TRAVIS: Yeah,
you keep practicing to be a monster.

3567
02:57:29,402 --> 02:57:31,190
ASHLEY: Okay, I will, Grog.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3568
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:33,081
ASHLEY: I'm a monster!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3569
02:57:33,081 --> 02:57:36,860
MATT: So you write down "gate stone"
on your inventory.

3570
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:43,114
TALIESIN: (quietly) She's staying 
in Whitestone while we do our work.

3571
02:57:43,114 --> 02:57:46,850
(louder) Thank you
for keeping my home safe.

3572
02:57:46,850 --> 02:57:51,962
ASHLEY: You're welcome.
TALIESIN: Thank you. (sighs)

3573
02:57:51,962 --> 02:57:54,448
MARISHA: Well,
at least it's not as far as Vasselheim.

3574
02:57:54,448 --> 02:57:55,216
TRAVIS: No.

3575
02:57:55,216 --> 02:57:57,420
LAURA: That's true.
ASHLEY: No, it's not.

3576
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:58,875
TALIESIN: We won't be gone long.

3577
02:57:58,875 --> 02:58:03,103
ASHLEY: No. And maybe
I'll meet you very soon.

3578
02:58:03,103 --> 02:58:04,138
LAURA: Yeah.

3579
02:58:04,138 --> 02:58:05,834
ASHLEY: I'll just help out where I can.

3580
02:58:08,114 --> 02:58:11,828
We got him once. I can get him again.

3581
02:58:11,828 --> 02:58:13,195
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: (cackles)

3582
02:58:13,195 --> 02:58:15,265
ASHLEY: (laughs)
MATT: "As you can."

3583
02:58:15,265 --> 02:58:17,271
TRAVIS: Dragon-slayer
and Rakshasa-slayer.

3584
02:58:17,271 --> 02:58:19,000
ASHLEY: I'm a monster.

3585
02:58:21,010 --> 02:58:24,948
MATT: "All right.
Where are you off to, then?"

3586
02:58:24,948 --> 02:58:29,729
TALIESIN: I'd say one more
proper night's sleep,

3587
02:58:29,729 --> 02:58:31,266
then into the Feywild.

3588
02:58:31,266 --> 02:58:32,545
LAURA: The Feywild.

3589
02:58:32,545 --> 02:58:33,784
TRAVIS: Feywild?

3590
02:58:33,784 --> 02:58:36,076
TALIESIN: We've seen
what the Vestiges can be.

3591
02:58:36,076 --> 02:58:38,968
I think they're...
terribly important.

3592
02:58:38,968 --> 02:58:43,221
And we can return
from the Feywild immediately

3593
02:58:43,221 --> 02:58:47,271
and in theory,
be right back here when we're finished,

3594
02:58:47,271 --> 02:58:48,303
and perhaps by then

3595
02:58:48,303 --> 02:58:51,582
we'll have an avenue of attack
to this rakshasa.

3596
02:58:51,582 --> 02:58:54,568
LAURA: And we can just pop on in there
because of you, Keyleth.

3597
02:58:54,568 --> 02:58:56,131
MARISHA: Yes.

3598
02:58:56,131 --> 02:58:59,033
LIAM: We're going to make you a beast.

3599
02:58:59,033 --> 02:59:02,025
LAURA: Oh. Sure.
MARISHA: Beefing up the twins.

3600
02:59:02,025 --> 02:59:03,628
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3601
02:59:03,628 --> 02:59:05,499
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Beast.

3602
02:59:05,499 --> 02:59:08,130
LAURA: Let's find it.

3603
02:59:08,130 --> 02:59:11,072
MARISHA: I go up to Pike.

3604
02:59:11,072 --> 02:59:15,972
MARISHA: Can we take a quick walk?
ASHLEY: Of course.

3605
02:59:15,972 --> 02:59:17,405
MARISHA: Before we take off?

3606
02:59:17,405 --> 02:59:22,477
TALIESIN: I figure we would take
one full night's sleep -

3607
02:59:22,477 --> 02:59:24,681
MARISHA: Before I take us in? Okay.

3608
02:59:24,681 --> 02:59:25,680
TALIESIN: We leave at dawn?

3609
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:28,374
ASHLEY: We plan at dawn?
MARISHA: Plan at dawn? (laughs)

3610
02:59:28,374 --> 02:59:29,737
TALIESIN: We plan at dawn.
MARISHA: We plan to leave at dawn.

3611
02:59:29,737 --> 02:59:31,445
TALIESIN: We plan to leave at dawn.

3612
02:59:31,445 --> 02:59:34,619
TRAVIS: You thought it was stupid
when I said it, but what?

3613
02:59:34,619 --> 02:59:37,491
ASHLEY: They learned.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3614
02:59:37,491 --> 02:59:39,806
TALIESIN: Right on thirty is fine,
if you say 9:00, 9:30.

3615
02:59:39,806 --> 02:59:41,425
MARISHA: Yeah. 9:00, 9:30.
We plan ahead.

3616
02:59:41,425 --> 02:59:43,331
TALIESIN: Barring traffic.

3617
02:59:43,331 --> 02:59:44,838
MARISHA: Okay,
I'm going to take a walk with Pike.

3618
02:59:44,838 --> 02:59:46,112
LAURA: You just have a Trapper-Keeper
full of appointments?

3619
02:59:46,112 --> 02:59:49,120
MATT: You just walk down the path
from Whitestone castle?

3620
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:52,642
MARISHA: Yeah, whatever.
We take a nice stroll around the Sun Tree.

3621
02:59:52,642 --> 02:59:54,697
MATT: All right, so you guys
start making your way

3622
02:59:54,697 --> 02:59:56,806
down towards Whitestone proper.

3623
02:59:56,806 --> 02:59:59,384
As you walk along the way...

3624
03:00:02,124 --> 03:00:08,973
MARISHA: I don't know, really,
how to start this conversation. (sighs)

3625
03:00:08,973 --> 03:00:11,090
I guess I just wanted to talk to you,

3626
03:00:11,090 --> 03:00:13,579
and maybe you can give
a little bit of insight

3627
03:00:13,579 --> 03:00:16,149
and help clear my head.

3628
03:00:16,149 --> 03:00:17,038
ASHLEY: Okay.

3629
03:00:17,038 --> 03:00:22,933
MARISHA: And I didn't think about it
until we were in Scanlan's spa the other day,

3630
03:00:22,933 --> 03:00:25,977
and you said you were really confused,

3631
03:00:25,977 --> 03:00:29,349
and I'm really confused,
and I didn't know you were confused

3632
03:00:29,349 --> 03:00:31,019
because I feel like
if I knew you were confused,

3633
03:00:31,019 --> 03:00:33,304
then I wouldn't feel so bad
about being confused

3634
03:00:33,304 --> 03:00:34,913
because we're confused together.

3635
03:00:34,913 --> 03:00:37,292
ASHLEY: I feel confused... all the time.

3636
03:00:37,292 --> 03:00:38,890
MARISHA: Do you? I do, too!
ASHLEY: Yes!

3637
03:00:38,890 --> 03:00:41,033
ASHLEY: Just in a perpetual state
of confusion.

3638
03:00:41,033 --> 03:00:45,139
MARISHA: The world is so big.
ASHLEY: I think that's just what life is.

3639
03:00:45,139 --> 03:00:48,299
MARISHA: (sighs) Right.
The world's really big.

3640
03:00:48,299 --> 03:00:50,036
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Very confusing.

3641
03:00:50,036 --> 03:00:53,386
LAURA AND LIAM: (laugh)

3642
03:00:53,386 --> 03:00:58,431
MARISHA: I guess I just -

3643
03:00:58,431 --> 03:01:05,136
I've always respected you
and looked up to you, and...

3644
03:01:07,156 --> 03:01:12,298
you're a cleric of Sarenrae,
but you still seem to be

3645
03:01:12,298 --> 03:01:15,060
very much in control
of your life and your destiny,

3646
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:20,093
and you seem to know
where you're going.

3647
03:01:20,093 --> 03:01:22,944
(boxes fall offscreen)

3648
03:01:22,944 --> 03:01:26,312
MARISHA: Fucking...
(shouts) Assassin!

3649
03:01:26,312 --> 03:01:27,926
MATT: You look around and you see

3650
03:01:27,926 --> 03:01:30,481
a boy holding a wheelbarrow nearby

3651
03:01:30,481 --> 03:01:33,035
is picking up a bunch of fruit
that had fallen out.

3652
03:01:33,035 --> 03:01:35,401
"I'm terribly sorry.
Didn't mean to bother you."

3653
03:01:35,401 --> 03:01:37,111
He puts them back in
and keeps wheeling on.

3654
03:01:37,111 --> 03:01:38,174
ASHLEY: It's all right. It's okay.

3655
03:01:38,174 --> 03:01:40,442
MARISHA: I've always loved,
"My cabbages!"

3656
03:01:40,442 --> 03:01:42,472
MATT: "My cabbages!" Yes.

3657
03:01:42,472 --> 03:01:43,711
MARISHA: Anyway,

3658
03:01:43,711 --> 03:01:46,734
Sorry, it was distract - loud noises.

3659
03:01:46,734 --> 03:01:49,197
ASHLEY: It's okay.
I feel like maybe I just look that way,

3660
03:01:49,197 --> 03:01:54,458
because I don't feel like
I have much of anything together,

3661
03:01:54,458 --> 03:01:56,513
or know where I'm going.

3662
03:01:56,513 --> 03:02:00,186
MARISHA: (laughs) I guess
that's probably all of us.

3663
03:02:00,186 --> 03:02:00,943
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3664
03:02:00,943 --> 03:02:05,655
MARISHA: I guess I just -
I'm a little curious

3665
03:02:05,655 --> 03:02:09,674
on how your relationship
with Sarenrae works,

3666
03:02:09,674 --> 03:02:15,097
because it doesn't necessarily
seem like she... is in control of you.

3667
03:02:15,097 --> 03:02:16,648
ASHLEY: No.

3668
03:02:16,648 --> 03:02:20,840
MARISHA: Or has dominion over you.

3669
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:26,462
ASHLEY: It's an interesting thing.
I think...

3670
03:02:26,462 --> 03:02:33,017
She just helps when we need her,
or when I need her,

3671
03:02:33,017 --> 03:02:37,644
and I think for the rest of the time,
She just -

3672
03:02:37,644 --> 03:02:38,945
MARISHA: Does her own thing?

3673
03:02:38,945 --> 03:02:40,559
ASHLEY: - does her own thing.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3674
03:02:40,559 --> 03:02:42,215
ASHLEY: It was interesting

3675
03:02:42,215 --> 03:02:46,604
going to the Temple
of the Raven Queen.

3676
03:02:46,604 --> 03:02:51,409
She seems... very interesting to me.

3677
03:02:51,409 --> 03:02:53,553
MARISHA: How do you mean?

3678
03:02:55,773 --> 03:02:57,361
ASHLEY: I don't know.

3679
03:02:57,361 --> 03:03:00,473
MARISHA: Like more...
ASHLEY: She's just very involved.

3680
03:03:00,473 --> 03:03:02,260
MARISHA: Involved? Yeah.

3681
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:05,691
ASHLEY: But maybe that's -

3682
03:03:05,691 --> 03:03:11,130
maybe that's because Vax
has fully given himself to Her.

3683
03:03:11,130 --> 03:03:12,940
MARISHA: Would you say

3684
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:14,851
you haven't fully given yourself
to Sarenrae?

3685
03:03:17,371 --> 03:03:23,522
ASHLEY: (hesitantly) I think I try to,

3686
03:03:23,522 --> 03:03:30,361
but there's always
that little part of me that thinks...

3687
03:03:32,731 --> 03:03:34,950
or has doubt?

3688
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:37,680
So I don't know.

3689
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:45,602
MARISHA: Growing up in the Ashari tribe,
we were taught

3690
03:03:45,602 --> 03:03:50,494
that the gods mind their own business
and we mind our own.

3691
03:03:50,494 --> 03:03:55,302
I don't have any disrespect for them,

3692
03:03:55,302 --> 03:03:59,642
but also want to... tread lightly.

3693
03:03:59,642 --> 03:04:05,241
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think that's
a very good way to handle it.

3694
03:04:05,241 --> 03:04:08,123
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know.

3695
03:04:08,123 --> 03:04:09,960
I guess I don't know
what I really wanted to find.

3696
03:04:09,960 --> 03:04:13,115
I guess misery loves company.

3697
03:04:13,115 --> 03:04:13,833
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3698
03:04:13,833 --> 03:04:17,277
MARISHA: It feels better
knowing I'm not the only one confused.

3699
03:04:17,277 --> 03:04:19,135
ASHLEY: Yes, there are two confused souls
in the world.

3700
03:04:19,135 --> 03:04:21,245
I'm sure there are so many more.

3701
03:04:21,245 --> 03:04:22,775
MARISHA: I confuse you?

3702
03:04:22,775 --> 03:04:25,668
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs) Hugs.

3703
03:04:25,668 --> 03:04:28,901
MARISHA: Hugs. Well.

3704
03:04:28,901 --> 03:04:31,563
I'm beginning to get the idea

3705
03:04:31,563 --> 03:04:35,065
that we're going to be
intermingling with gods

3706
03:04:35,065 --> 03:04:36,370
a little bit more, so.

3707
03:04:36,370 --> 03:04:37,724
ASHLEY: I think we will.

3708
03:04:37,724 --> 03:04:39,294
MARISHA: I guess it's something

3709
03:04:39,294 --> 03:04:40,901
I'm going to have to
start getting comfortable with.

3710
03:04:40,901 --> 03:04:43,116
ASHLEY: I think you should.

3711
03:04:43,116 --> 03:04:46,745
And I think...

3712
03:04:46,745 --> 03:04:51,155
you should
get comfortable with Vax.

3713
03:04:51,155 --> 03:04:53,157
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: (embarrassed) Oh!

3714
03:04:53,157 --> 03:04:57,980
ASHLEY: I think he really fancies you.

3715
03:04:57,980 --> 03:05:00,872
MARISHA: (weakly) Uh-huh?

3716
03:05:00,872 --> 03:05:02,084
ASHLEY: But don't be scared.

3717
03:05:02,084 --> 03:05:03,750
MARISHA: I'm so terrified.

3718
03:05:03,750 --> 03:05:05,633
ASHLEY: Just know
that things are not forever...

3719
03:05:07,343 --> 03:05:12,569
MARISHA: (sighs) I think that's my fear.
ASHLEY: And just have fun, you know?

3720
03:05:14,679 --> 03:05:17,410
MARISHA: (weak laughter)
I haven't had fun in a long time.

3721
03:05:17,410 --> 03:05:19,731
ASHLEY: Well, you should.

3722
03:05:19,731 --> 03:05:21,286
MARISHA: I should.

3723
03:05:21,286 --> 03:05:26,374
ASHLEY: We all need a little fun. 
(chuckles)

3724
03:05:26,374 --> 03:05:30,092
Well, I'll see you very soon.

3725
03:05:30,092 --> 03:05:33,097
MARISHA: You're always with us,
wherever we go.

3726
03:05:33,097 --> 03:05:34,113
ASHLEY: Okay.

3727
03:05:34,113 --> 03:05:35,646
MARISHA: (sighs)

3728
03:05:35,646 --> 03:05:36,464
ASHLEY: I love you.

3729
03:05:36,464 --> 03:05:37,431
MARISHA: I love you.

3730
03:05:37,431 --> 03:05:41,482
SAM: When I heard she was leaving,
I went out looking for Pike,

3731
03:05:41,482 --> 03:05:45,090
and I've come up to where they are.

3732
03:05:45,090 --> 03:05:48,600
MATT: They're both standing
at the northern base of the Sun Tree

3733
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:50,269
in the center of the town square.

3734
03:05:50,269 --> 03:05:53,205
You see them hugging
and give each other a kiss on the cheek.

3735
03:05:53,205 --> 03:05:55,072
SAM: (out of breath) Oh, sorry.
MARISHA: (shouting) Assassin!

3736
03:05:55,072 --> 03:05:58,951
SAM: No, no, it's me.
It's me. It's me. Sorry. Sorry.

3737
03:05:58,951 --> 03:06:01,657
ASHLEY: Oh.
MARISHA: Haa - sure.

3738
03:06:01,657 --> 03:06:03,875
SAM: There was
a very frightened child over there

3739
03:06:03,875 --> 03:06:04,973
with a bunch of fruit.

3740
03:06:04,973 --> 03:06:07,694
(all laugh)

3741
03:06:07,694 --> 03:06:08,796
ASHLEY: Oh, he just -

3742
03:06:08,796 --> 03:06:10,495
MARISHA: I might have
screamed in his face.

3743
03:06:10,495 --> 03:06:11,883
ASHLEY: Yeah, we thought
he was an assassin.

3744
03:06:11,883 --> 03:06:13,528
MARISHA: Assassin, yeah.
SAM: He was crying.

3745
03:06:13,528 --> 03:06:17,421
SAM: Maybe you should go -
here, take a gold piece.

3746
03:06:17,421 --> 03:06:18,841
Why don't you go
buy something from him?

3747
03:06:18,841 --> 03:06:20,855
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
What do you want?

3748
03:06:20,855 --> 03:06:22,242
You want some limes?
Some grapefruit?

3749
03:06:22,242 --> 03:06:23,208
SAM: I love a good lime.

3750
03:06:23,208 --> 03:06:24,732
MARISHA: You love a good lime?
I'll go to him and get some limes.

3751
03:06:24,732 --> 03:06:26,226
ASHLEY: See if he has a Choco Taco or -

3752
03:06:26,226 --> 03:06:29,616
MARISHA: Yeah, sure, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, okay.

3753
03:06:29,616 --> 03:06:30,929
I'm going to go to the kid.

3754
03:06:30,929 --> 03:06:32,768
MATT: Choco Taco, by the way,
is Draconic

3755
03:06:32,768 --> 03:06:38,204
for a fine cheese sandwich
in Wildmount.

3756
03:06:38,204 --> 03:06:40,576
It's a delicacy.

3757
03:06:40,576 --> 03:06:42,594
MARISHA: It's like
one of those traveling food carts?

3758
03:06:42,594 --> 03:06:45,232
You've got to track them on social media
to see where he's going to be?

3759
03:06:45,232 --> 03:06:47,224
MATT: Keyleth skips off in the direction -

3760
03:06:47,224 --> 03:06:48,272
ASHLEY: Love you, Kiki!

3761
03:06:48,272 --> 03:06:52,335
SAM: Pike, sorry.
I didn't know we were parting ways.

3762
03:06:52,335 --> 03:06:57,183
ASHLEY: I know. Maybe it won't be for long,
but I think I should stay.

3763
03:06:57,183 --> 03:07:00,453
SAM: Well, I respect that.
I just wanted to -

3764
03:07:00,453 --> 03:07:04,794
before we bid adieu, I wanted -
I can't believe we're leaving you again.

3765
03:07:04,794 --> 03:07:06,766
SAM: It's so sad.
ASHLEY: I know.

3766
03:07:06,766 --> 03:07:10,028
SAM: But I just wanted
to clear the air a bit.

3767
03:07:10,028 --> 03:07:13,772
You know, a short while ago,
I proposed marriage.

3768
03:07:13,772 --> 03:07:15,578
I've been thinking about it a lot -

3769
03:07:15,578 --> 03:07:18,578
ASHLEY: I know. I did not forget.
SAM: - and I hope you have been, too.

3770
03:07:18,578 --> 03:07:23,489
ASHLEY: Yes. I have been 
thinking about it so much.

3771
03:07:26,359 --> 03:07:28,465
MARISHA: About this time,
I take the limes and I go,

3772
03:07:28,465 --> 03:07:30,606
"(shouting) Hey, Pike! Look! Fun!"

3773
03:07:30,606 --> 03:07:32,265
As I juggle them.

3774
03:07:32,265 --> 03:07:34,616
MARISHA: I'm having fun! (forced laughter)
ASHLEY: I'm proud of you!

3775
03:07:34,616 --> 03:07:35,918
TALIESIN: I feel
that this is a skill check.

3776
03:07:35,918 --> 03:07:38,202
No. I spent too long in high school
learning how to juggle.

3777
03:07:38,202 --> 03:07:39,299
Skill check.

3778
03:07:39,299 --> 03:07:41,699
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

3779
03:07:41,699 --> 03:07:42,689
MARISHA: (laughs)

3780
03:07:42,689 --> 03:07:43,721
TALIESIN: No!
That's not how it works.

3781
03:07:43,721 --> 03:07:44,981
MARISHA: Fuck you, Percy,
you're not here!

3782
03:07:44,981 --> 03:07:46,312
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3783
03:07:46,312 --> 03:07:47,985
TRAVIS: It's off the table.
It's an automatic fail.

3784
03:07:47,985 --> 03:07:49,378
MARISHA: It landed on a -

3785
03:07:49,378 --> 03:07:51,384
LIAM: It's a fudge.
It landed on a blanket on an angle.

3786
03:07:51,384 --> 03:07:54,575
MARISHA: (laughs) What is it,
just a straight dex?

3787
03:07:54,575 --> 03:07:56,120
MATT: Acrobatics.
MARISHA: Acrobatics?

3788
03:07:56,120 --> 03:07:57,263
TALIESIN: Sorry. Sorry. I have -

3789
03:07:57,263 --> 03:07:58,202
MARISHA: 10!

3790
03:07:58,202 --> 03:08:00,503
MATT: 10. The limes (thud)
all over the ground.

3791
03:08:00,503 --> 03:08:01,440
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3792
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:04,361
MARISHA: (forced laughter)
This is fun! I'll just keep going.

3793
03:08:04,361 --> 03:08:07,954
MATT: Keyleth slowly backs away,
realizing the moment.

3794
03:08:07,954 --> 03:08:08,763
MARISHA: Sorry!

3795
03:08:08,763 --> 03:08:11,190
MATT: Goes to get less-bruised limes.

3796
03:08:11,190 --> 03:08:12,806
SAM: Anyway, listen,

3797
03:08:12,806 --> 03:08:16,312
before you do what you're going to do
and we're going to go off on our way,

3798
03:08:16,312 --> 03:08:18,245
I just wanted to say

3799
03:08:18,245 --> 03:08:24,867
that I am here to officially
absolve you of that proposal,

3800
03:08:24,867 --> 03:08:29,316
and I rescind it.
I was foolish to do so,

3801
03:08:29,316 --> 03:08:34,980
and I don't want there to be
any strings attached when we leave,

3802
03:08:34,980 --> 03:08:40,008
and I think, really,
with you on the cusp of parting ways

3803
03:08:40,008 --> 03:08:41,933
and me seeing my daughter
and everything,

3804
03:08:41,933 --> 03:08:46,568
everything's come into
a bit of a clearer focus, and...

3805
03:08:49,818 --> 03:08:55,149
I think I've always been in love
with the idea of you.

3806
03:08:55,149 --> 03:09:00,565
You know, you're so perfect
and beautiful and smart and -

3807
03:09:00,565 --> 03:09:02,537
ASHLEY: It was the hairy shoulders,
wasn't it.

3808
03:09:02,537 --> 03:09:04,892
(all laugh)

3809
03:09:04,892 --> 03:09:08,741
SAM: But I don't want
to love an idea. I want to love a girl.

3810
03:09:08,741 --> 03:09:12,132
And I think in all of this time
of pining after you,

3811
03:09:12,132 --> 03:09:15,964
I forgot to just hang out with you
and know you as a person,

3812
03:09:15,964 --> 03:09:17,409
and I'm sorry for that.

3813
03:09:17,409 --> 03:09:19,512
ASHLEY: That's okay, Scanlan.

3814
03:09:19,512 --> 03:09:22,388
SAM: So I'm sorry
for objectifying you or whatever.

3815
03:09:22,388 --> 03:09:24,682
LAURA AND LIAM: (giggle)
MARISHA: (laughing) "Or whatever."

3816
03:09:24,682 --> 03:09:26,258
ASHLEY: It's okay.
These things happen.

3817
03:09:26,258 --> 03:09:31,504
And maybe it wasn't the best time,
and maybe someday in the future,

3818
03:09:31,504 --> 03:09:36,534
we can just reconnoiter

3819
03:09:36,534 --> 03:09:40,814
and see if we want to make a -

3820
03:09:40,814 --> 03:09:43,682
just talk about it again, I guess.

3821
03:09:43,682 --> 03:09:45,166
SAM: We'll be friends.
ASHLEY: We'll be friends.

3822
03:09:45,166 --> 03:09:46,135
SAM: We'll be friends.

3823
03:09:46,135 --> 03:09:47,387
Listen, I will always love you,

3824
03:09:47,387 --> 03:09:52,834
but I don't want this to be
a barrier in our friendship anymore,

3825
03:09:52,834 --> 03:09:55,339
so I'm taking it off the table.

3826
03:09:55,339 --> 03:09:59,069
And besides, all I really want
is to matter to someone,

3827
03:09:59,069 --> 03:10:01,825
and I do now,
and that's very new for me,

3828
03:10:01,825 --> 03:10:04,473
and confusing, and exhilarating,

3829
03:10:04,473 --> 03:10:07,804
and I've got to figure out
how to do it

3830
03:10:07,804 --> 03:10:12,101
and, well, I'll work on that,

3831
03:10:12,101 --> 03:10:14,332
and you work
on whatever you're working on,

3832
03:10:14,332 --> 03:10:16,457
and I will say this before we leave.

3833
03:10:16,457 --> 03:10:19,772
I'm a little older than you,
so I can give you some advice.

3834
03:10:19,772 --> 03:10:21,496
ASHLEY: Oh, I - okay.

3835
03:10:21,496 --> 03:10:24,183
(all laugh)

3836
03:10:24,183 --> 03:10:25,421
SAM: I will say,

3837
03:10:25,421 --> 03:10:28,396
speaking as someone
who has lost out

3838
03:10:28,396 --> 03:10:32,194
on years of a relationship
with someone I care deeply about,

3839
03:10:32,194 --> 03:10:35,487
if you have someone out there
that you love,

3840
03:10:35,487 --> 03:10:41,509
you should tell that person,
or, at least, tell someone about it.

3841
03:10:41,509 --> 03:10:45,022
It's a weight
that you're going to continue to bear,

3842
03:10:45,022 --> 03:10:47,393
and you're going to miss out
on months and years

3843
03:10:47,393 --> 03:10:49,784
of either knowing or not knowing.

3844
03:10:49,784 --> 03:10:51,705
ASHLEY: That's very true.

3845
03:10:51,705 --> 03:10:55,398
SAM: You don't have to tell me,
but you're the bravest woman I know,

3846
03:10:55,398 --> 03:10:58,205
and you should be brave enough
to just admit your feelings.

3847
03:10:58,205 --> 03:11:03,797
ASHLEY: (sighs) Well, maybe -

3848
03:11:03,797 --> 03:11:09,425
(all laugh)

3849
03:11:09,425 --> 03:11:16,137
ASHLEY: (stuttering) I'll think on it more.

3850
03:11:16,137 --> 03:11:19,187
And just, yeah. I have to get -

3851
03:11:19,187 --> 03:11:22,797
maybe I'll get more courage
just by staying here and, you know...

3852
03:11:22,797 --> 03:11:27,743
But thank you for the advice,
wise old man.

3853
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:31,110
(all laugh)

3854
03:11:31,110 --> 03:11:34,192
LIAM: Bulletproof to peer pressure.

3855
03:11:34,192 --> 03:11:36,945
SAM: Anyway, I just wanted to say -

3856
03:11:36,945 --> 03:11:40,360
ASHLEY: But you are very charming.
I just wanted to tell you that.

3857
03:11:40,360 --> 03:11:42,462
SAM: Ah. It's not happening, sorry.

3858
03:11:42,462 --> 03:11:43,800
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

3859
03:11:43,800 --> 03:11:50,087
(extended laughter)

3860
03:11:50,087 --> 03:11:51,039
SAM: Just so I'm clear.

3861
03:11:51,039 --> 03:11:52,324
ASHLEY: Nothing.
SAM: Off the table now.

3862
03:11:52,324 --> 03:11:54,516
ASHLEY: Off the table. Nothing.

3863
03:11:54,516 --> 03:11:58,764
(others continue to laugh)

3864
03:11:58,764 --> 03:12:01,952
ASHLEY: All right. Well.

3865
03:12:01,952 --> 03:12:04,824
SAM: I'm sorry.
I just have to let you down.

3866
03:12:04,824 --> 03:12:10,043
ASHLEY: It's really okay.
(laughs) All right.

3867
03:12:10,043 --> 03:12:12,393
SAM: All right, well.
Oh! Hugs?

3868
03:12:12,393 --> 03:12:13,667
ASHLEY: Just a friend hug.

3869
03:12:13,667 --> 03:12:15,295
SAM: Of course. Of course.

3870
03:12:15,295 --> 03:12:17,712
LIAM: Careful you don't get
velcroed to her shoulders.

3871
03:12:17,712 --> 03:12:20,163
MATT: Make another acrobatics check.

3872
03:12:20,163 --> 03:12:25,531
MARISHA: (laughs) Worse. 8.

3873
03:12:25,531 --> 03:12:29,030
I'm trying, Pike!
(crying) I'm having so much fun!

3874
03:12:29,030 --> 03:12:32,293
ASHLEY: It's okay! It's okay!
We'll talk later.

3875
03:12:32,293 --> 03:12:33,737
MARISHA: (crying) Huh?

3876
03:12:33,737 --> 03:12:36,775
ASHLEY: Can I - I'll just say bye
to the rest of the group.

3877
03:12:36,775 --> 03:12:39,653
LAURA: (unhappy noise) Oh, oh.
ASHLEY: It's okay.

3878
03:12:39,653 --> 03:12:41,775
ASHLEY: You don't need to cry yet.
LAURA: It’s all going so fast.

3879
03:12:41,775 --> 03:12:43,198
ASHLEY: Maybe we'll see you very soon.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3880
03:12:43,198 --> 03:12:44,565
LIAM: Are we going already? 
LAURA: I’m just so proud.

3881
03:12:44,565 --> 03:12:47,089
ASHLEY: Wait, are we going already
or do we have the night?

3882
03:12:47,089 --> 03:12:48,859
TALIESIN: We have the night to sleep
and we leave at dawn.

3883
03:12:48,859 --> 03:12:50,559
ASHLEY: Sorry, I just wanted
to give you a hug.

3884
03:12:50,559 --> 03:12:52,186
LAURA: I just really wanted to hug you, too.

3885
03:12:52,186 --> 03:12:53,518
ASHLEY: Yeah, because
you're one of my best friends

3886
03:12:53,518 --> 03:12:55,494
and I needed to give you a hug.

3887
03:12:55,494 --> 03:12:57,212
ASHLEY: It's going to be fine.
LAURA: Yeah.

3888
03:12:57,212 --> 03:12:58,277
ASHLEY: I may be here next week.

3889
03:12:58,277 --> 03:12:59,374
LAURA: You might.

3890
03:12:59,374 --> 03:13:02,373
LIAM: I mean, do your work tomorrow.
Can't we get shitfaced one last time?

3891
03:13:02,373 --> 03:13:03,718
ASHLEY: Let's go get shitfaced.
Come on!

3892
03:13:03,718 --> 03:13:04,707
LAURA: Can I just -

3893
03:13:04,707 --> 03:13:06,459
LAURA: (whispers) Percy.
TALIESIN: What? Yes?

3894
03:13:06,459 --> 03:13:07,807
LAURA: One quick question -
TALIESIN: Yes?

3895
03:13:07,807 --> 03:13:12,836
LAURA: I don't want to bother you
because I know there's a lot going on,

3896
03:13:12,836 --> 03:13:16,728
but we're going into the Feywild.

3897
03:13:16,728 --> 03:13:17,780
TALIESIN: Yes.

3898
03:13:17,780 --> 03:13:23,469
LAURA: And... I'm really nervous
about this broom.

3899
03:13:23,469 --> 03:13:26,852
TALIESIN: (irritably) Do you see
the giant mess in front of me right now?

3900
03:13:26,852 --> 03:13:27,664
LAURA: Yeah?

3901
03:13:27,664 --> 03:13:30,554
TALIESIN: This is the thing for your broom.

3902
03:13:30,554 --> 03:13:34,347
I'm sitting here while you were drinking,
working on this.

3903
03:13:34,347 --> 03:13:35,633
LAURA: (gasps) You were?

3904
03:13:35,633 --> 03:13:39,142
TALIESIN: You will 
put a drink aside for me.

3905
03:13:39,142 --> 03:13:40,183
LAURA: Okay.

3906
03:13:40,183 --> 03:13:43,445
TALIESIN: I will see you
either later tonight, if this goes very -

3907
03:13:43,445 --> 03:13:44,896
Actually, give me the broom.
Just give me the broom.

3908
03:13:44,896 --> 03:13:46,485
LAURA: Okay. Well, all right, but -

3909
03:13:46,485 --> 03:13:47,600
TALIESIN: I will either see you
later tonight,

3910
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:48,737
or I will see you in the morning.

3911
03:13:48,737 --> 03:13:53,694
LAURA: Don't lose sleep over it.
Unless you really want to.

3912
03:13:53,694 --> 03:13:56,083
But I don't want
to force you into anything.

3913
03:13:56,083 --> 03:13:57,306
TALIESIN: This pains me.

3914
03:13:57,306 --> 03:13:59,659
This pains me,
and it must be put down.

3915
03:13:59,659 --> 03:14:03,293
This must be put down and finished!

3916
03:14:03,293 --> 03:14:06,354
LAURA: Thank you, dear.

3917
03:14:06,354 --> 03:14:07,630
TALIESIN: Good night.

3918
03:14:07,630 --> 03:14:11,334
TALIESIN: I'm going
to roll a tinker check, at some point.

3919
03:14:11,334 --> 03:14:12,170
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

3920
03:14:12,170 --> 03:14:14,786
As you guys spend the rest
of the afternoon -

3921
03:14:14,786 --> 03:14:16,234
which, you woke up late,
for the most part,

3922
03:14:16,234 --> 03:14:17,128
so the afternoon's pretty short.

3923
03:14:17,128 --> 03:14:20,731
But as the sun sets here in Whitestone,
the cloud cover takes in once more,

3924
03:14:20,731 --> 03:14:22,939
and a very light drizzle
begins to hit the rooftops,

3925
03:14:22,939 --> 03:14:24,506
and you hear in the distance

3926
03:14:24,506 --> 03:14:28,270
people finishing rebuilding the roofs
that were destroyed in the battle.

3927
03:14:28,270 --> 03:14:30,677
Some buildings
that are starting to be put back up again.

3928
03:14:30,677 --> 03:14:33,479
The city is definitely, over time,
coming back to life.

3929
03:14:33,479 --> 03:14:36,059
You also know
that throughout the day,

3930
03:14:36,059 --> 03:14:40,762
you can see Allura and Gilmore
and the Farseer Eskil

3931
03:14:40,762 --> 03:14:43,123
are beginning
to mark areas in the town.

3932
03:14:43,123 --> 03:14:44,879
You're not sure what for,
but you gather

3933
03:14:44,879 --> 03:14:47,511
it's probably preparation for their wards

3934
03:14:47,511 --> 03:14:49,797
they're going to start putting up
throughout Whitestone.

3935
03:14:49,797 --> 03:14:54,881
During this time,
you make your first tinker check.

3936
03:14:54,881 --> 03:14:56,384
LIAM: Roll to attach a Baby Bjorn?

3937
03:14:56,384 --> 03:14:58,004
LAURA: (quietly) Come on, come on.

3938
03:15:00,038 --> 03:15:02,331
TALIESIN: That's a 21.

3939
03:15:02,331 --> 03:15:08,262
MATT: 21? Okay.
Working a good portion of the evening -

3940
03:15:08,262 --> 03:15:10,615
TALIESIN: It's not my first roll at it,
so, yeah.

3941
03:15:10,615 --> 03:15:13,135
MATT: Yeah, you start making
some decent headway.

3942
03:15:13,135 --> 03:15:17,471
You get the stirrups
well-bolted into the side,

3943
03:15:17,471 --> 03:15:20,453
making sure not to interrupt
any of the enchantment.

3944
03:15:20,453 --> 03:15:23,012
You also begin to work

3945
03:15:23,012 --> 03:15:27,604
on the finer elements
of the seat portion of it,

3946
03:15:27,604 --> 03:15:30,366
which in itself will have
a gimbal hinge

3947
03:15:30,366 --> 03:15:33,229
to adjust based on positioning,

3948
03:15:33,229 --> 03:15:36,063
which will allow her
to actually functionally sit on the seat.

3949
03:15:36,063 --> 03:15:37,108
We'll get to that in a minute.

3950
03:15:37,108 --> 03:15:39,658
The rest of you guys,
anything else you're doing

3951
03:15:39,658 --> 03:15:41,632
other than just drinking
in the time you have left?

3952
03:15:41,632 --> 03:15:43,463
SAM: Yeah, I go to see Vex real quick.

3953
03:15:43,463 --> 03:15:45,317
LAURA: Me?
SAM: Yeah. Oi, you. Oi.

3954
03:15:45,317 --> 03:15:46,950
LAURA: Hey, what's going on?

3955
03:15:46,950 --> 03:15:49,466
SAM: Remember when I did you a favor,

3956
03:15:49,466 --> 03:15:52,746
and you came to my room,
and I taught you how to fly the broom?

3957
03:15:52,746 --> 03:15:54,151
LAURA: I very much remember that, Scanlan.

3958
03:15:54,151 --> 03:15:55,524
SAM: And you said you owed me one?

3959
03:15:55,524 --> 03:15:56,890
LAURA: I owe you so much.

3960
03:15:56,890 --> 03:16:00,115
SAM: Here's the payback.
LAURA: Oh, no.

3961
03:16:00,115 --> 03:16:02,818
SAM: You have to wear
this fucking hat every time you fly.

3962
03:16:02,818 --> 03:16:05,688
(all laugh)

3963
03:16:05,688 --> 03:16:09,599
LAURA: This pointy motherfucker?

3964
03:16:09,599 --> 03:16:13,829
LIAM: Oh my gods.
TALIESIN: That was a long walk!

3965
03:16:13,829 --> 03:16:16,096
MARISHA: Such a long walk!
TALIESIN: Wow.

3966
03:16:16,096 --> 03:16:17,531
LIAM: Playing a long game.

3967
03:16:17,531 --> 03:16:18,506
LAURA: How's it look?

3968
03:16:18,506 --> 03:16:20,562
SAM: It looks really cool.

3969
03:16:20,562 --> 03:16:21,747
LAURA: Well, there you go.

3970
03:16:21,747 --> 03:16:23,503
(all laugh)

3971
03:16:23,503 --> 03:16:25,098
LAURA: I will gladly
do this for you, Scanlan.

3972
03:16:25,098 --> 03:16:26,302
SAM: Thank you.

3973
03:16:26,302 --> 03:16:28,736
LAURA: Does this mean we're even?
This hat makes us even?

3974
03:16:28,736 --> 03:16:31,108
SAM: That would make me so happy.

3975
03:16:31,108 --> 03:16:33,210
TALIESIN: (snorts)
LIAM: (giggling) Wow.

3976
03:16:33,210 --> 03:16:34,820
SAM: The debt is paid.

3977
03:16:34,820 --> 03:16:35,885
MATT: As she cackles loudly,

3978
03:16:35,885 --> 03:16:37,529
the hat atop her head
is everything you hoped for.

3979
03:16:37,529 --> 03:16:41,133
(all crack up)

3980
03:16:41,133 --> 03:16:42,803
SAM: Yes!

3981
03:16:42,803 --> 03:16:45,470
ASHLEY: Oh, Vex, that hat is amazing!
LAURA: (cackles)

3982
03:16:45,470 --> 03:16:47,927
TRAVIS: She's actually cackling.

3983
03:16:47,927 --> 03:16:51,195
LIAM: Oh, you devious motherfucker.

3984
03:16:51,195 --> 03:16:52,334
TALIESIN: Wow.

3985
03:16:52,334 --> 03:16:57,191
LAURA: I fucking like it. I appreciate it.
ASHLEY: I think it looks amazing.

3986
03:16:57,191 --> 03:16:59,194
SAM: The silhouette
is beautiful on you.

3987
03:16:59,194 --> 03:17:00,434
LIAM: It's very aerodynamic.

3988
03:17:00,434 --> 03:17:01,567
LAURA: Yeah.

3989
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:05,638
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh my god.
LIAM: If you're going straight up.

3990
03:17:05,638 --> 03:17:07,959
LAURA: I would try it out,

3991
03:17:07,959 --> 03:17:09,948
but I don't have the broom on me
right now, so.

3992
03:17:09,948 --> 03:17:11,107
MATT: Another tinker check.

3993
03:17:11,107 --> 03:17:12,840
TALIESIN: (whispering) Oh, bastard.
MARISHA: (chanting) Go, go, go!

3994
03:17:12,840 --> 03:17:14,990
MATT: You guys are drinking,
carousing in a local tavern,

3995
03:17:14,990 --> 03:17:16,074
laughing at her new hat.

3996
03:17:16,074 --> 03:17:18,163
TALIESIN: That's a 25.

3997
03:17:18,163 --> 03:17:19,614
MATT: 25?

3998
03:17:19,614 --> 03:17:21,754
TALIESIN: Proficiency, dex, and roll.

3999
03:17:21,754 --> 03:17:24,534
MATT: As the wee hours begin to click by,

4000
03:17:24,534 --> 03:17:26,940
the rest of you have finished
your evening of drinking -

4001
03:17:26,940 --> 03:17:31,075
LAURA: I turn the hat at an angle
and make it look a little more dashing.

4002
03:17:31,075 --> 03:17:31,936
MATT: There you go.

4003
03:17:31,936 --> 03:17:35,806
Yeah, it's more stylistic.
It's more Vex'ahlia.

4004
03:17:35,806 --> 03:17:37,609
LAURA: I like it.
TRAVIS: "Vex'ahlia."

4005
03:17:37,609 --> 03:17:38,712
LIAM: Can I squeeze in
one mini-conversation

4006
03:17:38,712 --> 03:17:40,642
before the end of it all?

4007
03:17:40,642 --> 03:17:42,555
MATT: Yes. I'm going to start up here.

4008
03:17:42,555 --> 03:17:44,400
As the evening progresses,
up to that point in time,

4009
03:17:44,400 --> 03:17:47,223
you're battling and battling
with this gimbal,

4010
03:17:47,223 --> 03:17:51,405
and making sure that everything itself
can sustain the necessary weight

4011
03:17:51,405 --> 03:17:54,233
without putting too much pressure
on a single point within the broom

4012
03:17:54,233 --> 03:17:57,033
to actually splinter the wood
or damage the actual object.

4013
03:17:57,033 --> 03:17:59,824
You're not even paying attention

4014
03:17:59,824 --> 03:18:01,637
to the fact
that there's very little airflow

4015
03:18:01,637 --> 03:18:03,776
and the sweat's
been dripping off of your face,

4016
03:18:03,776 --> 03:18:07,007
as you just need
to get this project done.

4017
03:18:07,007 --> 03:18:10,551
And in the moment, it finally hits you,
not knowing what time it is,

4018
03:18:10,551 --> 03:18:14,253
but you lift it up in your hands,
and you can see the completed work.

4019
03:18:14,253 --> 03:18:16,586
Hoping it will function.
We shall see.

4020
03:18:16,586 --> 03:18:19,989
But for now, your project is done.

4021
03:18:19,989 --> 03:18:24,709
TALIESIN: I've got a wonderful 
little Elven signature on the bottom,

4022
03:18:24,709 --> 03:18:28,146
which I will tell you what it says
in just a little special signature,

4023
03:18:28,146 --> 03:18:29,957
and I put it aside.

4024
03:18:29,957 --> 03:18:32,657
I write down quick little notes

4025
03:18:32,657 --> 03:18:36,457
for some stuff that's to be taken care of
while we're away,

4026
03:18:36,457 --> 03:18:39,438
and I go find the bloody bar
that they have crashed.

4027
03:18:39,438 --> 03:18:40,548
MATT: All right.

4028
03:18:40,548 --> 03:18:42,033
TALIESIN: I'll take the broom.

4029
03:18:42,033 --> 03:18:44,026
LAURA: I hand him his drink
as soon as he comes in.

4030
03:18:44,026 --> 03:18:44,985
TALIESIN: I hand you a broom.

4031
03:18:44,985 --> 03:18:46,683
ASHLEY: Percy!
LAURA: (excited shout)

4032
03:18:46,683 --> 03:18:50,207
TALIESIN: At the very bottom in Elven,
scribed very gently with a twig,

4033
03:18:50,207 --> 03:18:52,418
it says in Elven,
"Death From Above."

4034
03:18:52,418 --> 03:18:53,204
SAM: Ooh.

4035
03:18:53,204 --> 03:18:55,059
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh, yes.
TRAVIS: Oh.

4036
03:18:55,059 --> 03:18:56,920
LAURA: Percy, you've outdone yourself.

4037
03:18:56,920 --> 03:18:58,010
MARISHA: You and the names.

4038
03:18:58,010 --> 03:19:00,041
ASHLEY: (gasps) That's amazing.

4039
03:19:00,041 --> 03:19:02,476
SAM: Give it a try.

4040
03:19:02,476 --> 03:19:03,716
LAURA: I just sit on it,
raise up a little,

4041
03:19:03,716 --> 03:19:06,521
take my hands off the broom -

4042
03:19:06,521 --> 03:19:07,316
MARISHA: I reach over

4043
03:19:07,316 --> 03:19:09,111
and I grab the chicken
that I'm sure is on the table,

4044
03:19:09,111 --> 03:19:09,835
and I say,

4045
03:19:09,835 --> 03:19:11,881
"Vex, pull!"

4046
03:19:11,881 --> 03:19:13,148
TALIESIN: (yelps)

4047
03:19:13,148 --> 03:19:15,782
MATT: Roll an attack.

4048
03:19:15,782 --> 03:19:18,750
LAURA: Oh, god.
Do I have to roll disadvantage?

4049
03:19:18,750 --> 03:19:19,625
MATT: Nope.

4050
03:19:19,625 --> 03:19:22,539
LAURA: Ha ha!
That's right, and it's a 30!

4051
03:19:22,539 --> 03:19:25,543
(excited cheers)

4052
03:19:25,543 --> 03:19:28,840
MATT: The arrow smashes
into the side of the half-eaten chicken,

4053
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:32,946
which, in your drunken state,
was not on your plate,

4054
03:19:32,952 --> 03:19:34,527
and you hear a voice go,

4055
03:19:34,527 --> 03:19:35,709
"Hey, that was my meal!"

4056
03:19:35,709 --> 03:19:36,912
(arrow impact)

4057
03:19:36,912 --> 03:19:39,240
TALIESIN: It's a 214-year-old pub. 
Oh, god.

4058
03:19:39,240 --> 03:19:41,404
MARISHA: (weakly) Sorry!

4059
03:19:41,404 --> 03:19:43,996
MATT: The chicken,
now stapled to the wall by the arrow,

4060
03:19:43,996 --> 03:19:48,144
and the somewhat
frustrated-looking gentleman

4061
03:19:48,144 --> 03:19:50,817
who is on the other side of the table,

4062
03:19:50,817 --> 03:19:52,833
who has just been eating on his own,
is like -

4063
03:19:52,833 --> 03:19:54,572
"How are you going to pay for that?"

4064
03:19:54,572 --> 03:19:58,230
LAURA: I'm sorry, sir. No, it's all right.
MARISHA: (stuttering)

4065
03:19:58,230 --> 03:20:00,500
LAURA: I fly up
and I grab it off the wall

4066
03:20:00,500 --> 03:20:02,340
and I bring it back down.

4067
03:20:02,340 --> 03:20:03,351
MATT: He hasn't really noticed
the flight thing at this point,

4068
03:20:03,351 --> 03:20:04,156
so he's just like,

4069
03:20:04,156 --> 03:20:05,765
"(awed) Oh."

4070
03:20:05,765 --> 03:20:07,534
MARISHA: I take my fire hands
and I blacken it

4071
03:20:07,534 --> 03:20:09,083
and make it like a nice shish kebab.

4072
03:20:09,083 --> 03:20:11,022
LAURA: You burned it. Thank you.

4073
03:20:11,022 --> 03:20:13,090
MARISHA: Just a little -
I'm getting the dirt off of it.

4074
03:20:13,090 --> 03:20:14,503
I'm getting the hair off of it.

4075
03:20:14,503 --> 03:20:16,938
LAURA: Sorry it's burned now,
but there you go.

4076
03:20:16,938 --> 03:20:18,419
MARISHA: There's a little hair on it.
MATT: "It's okay."

4077
03:20:18,419 --> 03:20:19,256
ASHLEY: A little extra cooked.

4078
03:20:19,256 --> 03:20:21,032
TALIESIN: A round for the gentleman.

4079
03:20:21,032 --> 03:20:23,550
MATT: "It's burned."
LAURA: Yes. Charred. It's nice and charred.

4080
03:20:23,550 --> 03:20:25,435
MAN WITH CHICKEN: (weakly) Thanks.

4081
03:20:25,435 --> 03:20:27,837
MARISHA: I'm not a cook.
MATT: "I can tell."

4082
03:20:27,837 --> 03:20:30,669
MARISHA: It's arcane fire.
What do you want from me?

4083
03:20:30,669 --> 03:20:32,862
MATT: "I want my chicken untouched."

4084
03:20:32,862 --> 03:20:35,992
And he starts cutting into it,
trying to find pieces that are edible.

4085
03:20:35,992 --> 03:20:38,317
LAURA: I land next to my brother.

4086
03:20:38,317 --> 03:20:40,350
You wanted to talk to me. Why?

4087
03:20:40,350 --> 03:20:42,342
LIAM: What, you?
I don't want to talk to you.

4088
03:20:42,342 --> 03:20:43,306
LAURA: Oh, well fuck it.

4089
03:20:43,306 --> 03:20:45,273
I get up and start flying again.

4090
03:20:45,273 --> 03:20:47,604
TALIESIN: I was going to
go take a seat next to Pike,

4091
03:20:47,604 --> 03:20:49,847
at some point.
I've got a letter for you.

4092
03:20:49,847 --> 03:20:50,933
LIAM: I think we all
want to say goodbye to Pike.

4093
03:20:50,933 --> 03:20:51,990
That's what I was going to do.

4094
03:20:51,990 --> 03:20:54,777
MATT: As this is happening,
while the flying display is happening

4095
03:20:54,777 --> 03:20:58,560
and you're really intent
on watching all the mechanisms work

4096
03:20:58,560 --> 03:21:01,944
and watching how it adjusts to her weight,
and you want to be damn sure

4097
03:21:01,944 --> 03:21:04,588
that everything
that's supposed to move is.

4098
03:21:04,588 --> 03:21:05,509
While this is happening...

4099
03:21:05,509 --> 03:21:06,645
LIAM: All right.

4100
03:21:06,645 --> 03:21:08,643
And I sit down next to her
and I scootch her a little bit.

4101
03:21:08,643 --> 03:21:10,833
Thank you, Pickle.

4102
03:21:10,833 --> 03:21:14,141
ASHLEY: Thanks, Vaxy.

4103
03:21:14,141 --> 03:21:18,403
LIAM: I'm starting to gather

4104
03:21:18,403 --> 03:21:22,024
that you don't have
as many answers as I thought,

4105
03:21:22,024 --> 03:21:26,311
but be that as it may,
you're still a great inspiration to me.

4106
03:21:26,311 --> 03:21:29,632
I still feel
like I'm following in your footsteps.

4107
03:21:29,632 --> 03:21:32,958
ASHLEY: Well...
LIAM: Take that for what it's worth.

4108
03:21:32,958 --> 03:21:34,682
ASHLEY: Or flying in my footsteps, rather.

4109
03:21:34,682 --> 03:21:37,543
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Because that's pretty cool.

4110
03:21:37,543 --> 03:21:41,227
LIAM: It is. It is pretty cool.

4111
03:21:41,227 --> 03:21:45,945
Fuck, we're going to miss you.

4112
03:21:45,945 --> 03:21:49,321
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you guys very much.

4113
03:21:51,631 --> 03:21:55,873
But maybe I'll see you more often?

4114
03:21:57,523 --> 03:22:01,453
LIAM: If you need us, blink of an eye.

4115
03:22:01,453 --> 03:22:04,543
Blink of an eye, we'll come back.

4116
03:22:04,543 --> 03:22:11,149
ASHLEY: Okay. (sighs) Okay.
And I'll just be there when I can.

4117
03:22:11,149 --> 03:22:12,986
LIAM: We know.

4118
03:22:12,986 --> 03:22:14,404
ASHLEY: Okay.

4119
03:22:14,404 --> 03:22:17,252
LIAM: It's going to hurt, but we know.

4120
03:22:17,252 --> 03:22:18,442
ASHLEY: Yeah?

4121
03:22:18,442 --> 03:22:23,970
LIAM: And you know that we all - all of us.
That big asshole over there.

4122
03:22:23,970 --> 03:22:26,202
ASHLEY: That big asshole.

4123
03:22:26,202 --> 03:22:27,749
LIAM: My twin, with the -

4124
03:22:27,749 --> 03:22:29,579
LAURA: I float down behind him -

4125
03:22:29,579 --> 03:22:31,302
LIAM: She's behind me, isn't she?
ASHLEY: Yes.

4126
03:22:31,302 --> 03:22:33,136
LAURA: - and give him bunny ears 
behind his head.

4127
03:22:33,136 --> 03:22:34,680
LIAM: That one.
ASHLEY: (laughs) Hi, Vex.

4128
03:22:34,680 --> 03:22:39,828
LIAM: Red, Whitey, Shorty.

4129
03:22:39,828 --> 03:22:42,216
We're all going to miss you.

4130
03:22:42,216 --> 03:22:47,778
ASHLEY: (sighs)
I'm going to miss you guys a lot.

4131
03:22:47,778 --> 03:22:50,873
LIAM: Cheers.

4132
03:22:50,873 --> 03:22:52,054
ASHLEY: Cheers.
LIAM: (toonk)

4133
03:22:52,054 --> 03:22:55,905
ASHLEY: (drinking noises)
LAURA: Gulp, gulp, glub, glub, glub.

4134
03:22:55,905 --> 03:22:59,082
LIAM: (sighs) All right.
ASHLEY: All right.

4135
03:22:59,082 --> 03:23:02,087
LIAM: I'm going to tie one on. Thanks.

4136
03:23:02,087 --> 03:23:04,763
ASHLEY: All right. Bye, Vax.

4137
03:23:04,763 --> 03:23:07,519
MATT: As you continue to drink, Percy -

4138
03:23:07,519 --> 03:23:08,546
MARISHA: Keyleth just hollers,

4139
03:23:08,546 --> 03:23:13,269
"Vax! Come sit by me."

4140
03:23:13,269 --> 03:23:19,180
LAURA: (loudly) Oooh! 
I mean, go for her...

4141
03:23:19,180 --> 03:23:21,800
MARISHA: (yelling) Shut the fuck up, Vex!
LIAM: Or say nothing!

4142
03:23:21,800 --> 03:23:23,757
LAURA: Say nothing.
I won't say anything.

4143
03:23:23,757 --> 03:23:25,300
I'm just going to keep flying around.

4144
03:23:25,300 --> 03:23:27,442
MARISHA: That's it.

4145
03:23:27,442 --> 03:23:28,464
MATT: All right. As Percy,

4146
03:23:28,464 --> 03:23:30,625
you see the opportunity now
as Vax moves

4147
03:23:30,625 --> 03:23:32,538
to take that same spot next to Pike.

4148
03:23:32,538 --> 03:23:34,479
TALIESIN: Oh, bloody hell,
about fucking time.

4149
03:23:34,479 --> 03:23:36,836
LIAM: (giggles)
TALIESIN: (sighs)

4150
03:23:36,836 --> 03:23:39,088
ASHLEY: Hi.

4151
03:23:39,088 --> 03:23:42,142
TALIESIN: You're intimidating as fuck,
you know that?

4152
03:23:42,142 --> 03:23:43,203
ASHLEY: Me?
TALIESIN: Yes.

4153
03:23:43,203 --> 03:23:44,459
ASHLEY: How?!

4154
03:23:47,639 --> 03:23:50,662
TALIESIN: Everyone's always worried
about impressing you.

4155
03:23:50,662 --> 03:23:53,453
ASHLEY: Impressing me?

4156
03:23:53,453 --> 03:23:54,709
TALIESIN: Yes, it's why we're rubbish
when you're not around.

4157
03:23:54,709 --> 03:23:56,900
Everybody's trying to impress you.

4158
03:23:56,900 --> 03:24:03,241
ASHLEY: You know, I'm just rubbish.
I'm just all the time rubbish. (laughs)

4159
03:24:03,241 --> 03:24:07,142
TALIESIN: I know. Believe me, I'm aware.

4160
03:24:07,142 --> 03:24:09,483
I hand her a letter, and say,

4161
03:24:09,483 --> 03:24:11,930
"Here's a list

4162
03:24:11,930 --> 03:24:14,462
"of every terrible thing
I've got going on in this city right now."

4163
03:24:14,462 --> 03:24:15,789
ASHLEY: Okay.

4164
03:24:15,789 --> 03:24:17,689
TALIESIN: "So you'll know
what I've got cooking.

4165
03:24:17,689 --> 03:24:22,268
"Plus some people
that if you need particular things,

4166
03:24:22,268 --> 03:24:25,175
"you can talk to in the city,
who are friends of the family.

4167
03:24:25,175 --> 03:24:28,080
"10 things to see in the city
that might be nice,

4168
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:31,560
"and my 10 favorite books in the library,
in case you get bored."

4169
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:33,299
ASHLEY: Oh, Percy.

4170
03:24:33,299 --> 03:24:34,826
SAM: What to Do in Whitestone
for 48 Hours.

4171
03:24:34,826 --> 03:24:35,619
TALIESIN: Exactly.

4172
03:24:35,619 --> 03:24:37,165
(all laugh)

4173
03:24:37,165 --> 03:24:39,043
TALIESIN: You're going to
have to kill some time, I'm sure.

4174
03:24:39,043 --> 03:24:40,444
MARISHA: Whitestone Atlas Obscura.

4175
03:24:40,444 --> 03:24:42,467
ASHLEY: I will make sure
to visit all of these places

4176
03:24:42,467 --> 03:24:43,987
and read all these things.

4177
03:24:43,987 --> 03:24:48,136
TALIESIN: I'll try
and keep the kids safe,

4178
03:24:48,136 --> 03:24:50,962
and I will try not to be
the thing that kills them, either.

4179
03:24:50,962 --> 03:24:52,927
ASHLEY: Well - oh.

4180
03:24:52,927 --> 03:24:55,616
I have something for you.

4181
03:24:55,616 --> 03:24:57,594
TALIESIN: Hm? All right.

4182
03:24:57,594 --> 03:25:01,977
SAM: Is it a profession of love?
(laughs) Damn it!

4183
03:25:01,977 --> 03:25:03,687
LIAM: (laughs)

4184
03:25:06,887 --> 03:25:12,365
ASHLEY: When we went to my house,
or, well, where I lived with Wilhand...

4185
03:25:12,365 --> 03:25:13,324
TALIESIN: I remember.

4186
03:25:13,324 --> 03:25:16,489
ASHLEY: I got something
from underneath the bed, and -

4187
03:25:16,489 --> 03:25:20,986
LAURA: (whispering) Was it lacy panties?
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yes, it's lacy panties.

4188
03:25:20,986 --> 03:25:23,574
(all laugh)

4189
03:25:23,574 --> 03:25:25,333
TALIESIN: I will wear them always.

4190
03:25:27,473 --> 03:25:29,135
ASHLEY: This is something

4191
03:25:29,135 --> 03:25:32,319
that's been in my family
for a really long time,

4192
03:25:32,319 --> 03:25:36,506
and I've been thinking about it,

4193
03:25:36,506 --> 03:25:40,849
and I feel like I need to give it to you.

4194
03:25:40,849 --> 03:25:45,082
So come closer to me real quick.

4195
03:25:47,732 --> 03:25:53,253
It's a necklace.
And just... don't take it off.

4196
03:25:53,253 --> 03:25:56,694
TALIESIN: Okay. I will keep it on.

4197
03:25:56,694 --> 03:25:58,348
ASHLEY: And it will keep you safe.

4198
03:25:58,348 --> 03:26:00,116
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4199
03:26:00,116 --> 03:26:01,476
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

4200
03:26:01,476 --> 03:26:05,340
TALIESIN: And please
keep all this safe, as well.

4201
03:26:05,340 --> 03:26:06,167
ASHLEY: I will.

4202
03:26:06,167 --> 03:26:08,801
And keep them safe,
and keep yourself safe, please?

4203
03:26:08,801 --> 03:26:13,822
TALIESIN: (sighs) Let's all be safe. 
To that.

4204
03:26:13,822 --> 03:26:15,128
ASHLEY: Cheers.
TALIESIN: Cheers, and god,

4205
03:26:15,128 --> 03:26:16,734
TALIESIN: I hope they're making out
in the next hour.

4206
03:26:16,734 --> 03:26:18,612
ASHLEY: Same.
TALIESIN: God, wouldn't that be lovely.

4207
03:26:18,612 --> 03:26:20,422
LAURA: I float down
and kick Grog in the head

4208
03:26:20,422 --> 03:26:21,517
and then float back up.

4209
03:26:21,517 --> 03:26:23,013
TRAVIS: Ow!

4210
03:26:23,013 --> 03:26:24,653
MATT: Make a perception check, Grog.

4211
03:26:26,803 --> 03:26:29,359
TRAVIS: Shit! 6.

4212
03:26:29,359 --> 03:26:31,056
(all laugh)

4213
03:26:31,056 --> 03:26:33,044
MATT: Someone fucking
threw something at your head.

4214
03:26:33,044 --> 03:26:35,430
TRAVIS: Who wants to go
right fucking now?

4215
03:26:35,430 --> 03:26:37,471
I was in the middle
of a gorgeous cup of ale

4216
03:26:37,471 --> 03:26:39,261
and I'm wearing half of it!

4217
03:26:39,261 --> 03:26:41,583
SAM: It was that guy
with the burnt chicken.

4218
03:26:41,583 --> 03:26:43,662
TRAVIS: I rush the guy
with the burnt chicken

4219
03:26:43,662 --> 03:26:46,252
and I pick him up,
and I throw him across the tavern.

4220
03:26:46,252 --> 03:26:47,513
MATT: "(screams)"

4221
03:26:47,513 --> 03:26:49,769
TRAVIS: Who's with
the burnt chicken piece of shit?

4222
03:26:49,769 --> 03:26:51,315
MATT: He slams onto a table.

4223
03:26:51,315 --> 03:26:53,491
You can now see
there are two guys in the back,

4224
03:26:53,491 --> 03:26:55,589
who are probably
part of the building crew here,

4225
03:26:55,589 --> 03:27:00,250
look at each other
and roll up their sleeves.

4226
03:27:00,250 --> 03:27:01,988
"We doing this?!"

4227
03:27:01,988 --> 03:27:04,643
ALL: YEAH!
LAURA: Big tavern brawl!

4228
03:27:04,643 --> 03:27:08,135
MATT: They rush in and start slugging at you
and it goes into an old-style -

4229
03:27:08,135 --> 03:27:10,164
TALIESIN: Outside. Outside!
LAURA: Trinket!

4230
03:27:10,164 --> 03:27:13,467
MARISHA: Keyleth picks up two chickens,
burns them with her hands,

4231
03:27:13,467 --> 03:27:15,378
and chucks them at the guys.

4232
03:27:15,378 --> 03:27:18,296
MARISHA: (shouting) Food fight!
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes!

4233
03:27:18,296 --> 03:27:21,081
MATT: A giant brawl
breaks out at this time.

4234
03:27:21,081 --> 03:27:22,581
TRAVIS: (laughing) Whole-tavern brawl.

4235
03:27:22,581 --> 03:27:27,236
MATT: You hear people laughing,
and the music picks up more,

4236
03:27:27,236 --> 03:27:30,284
and there's tables being tossed over.

4237
03:27:30,284 --> 03:27:33,449
There's a hint of gingerness to it;
no one's damaging the -

4238
03:27:33,449 --> 03:27:35,420
TRAVIS: Not the face. Not the face.

4239
03:27:35,420 --> 03:27:37,804
MATT: - you can see,
in general, in the city,

4240
03:27:37,804 --> 03:27:40,190
there's a lot of tension to get out
from previous events,

4241
03:27:40,190 --> 03:27:41,879
and there are a few folks in this town,

4242
03:27:41,879 --> 03:27:43,615
in this particular tavern 
that are enjoying

4243
03:27:43,615 --> 03:27:45,840
throwing a couple of punches 
and taking a few,

4244
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:47,040
and there are some folks 
that are watching,

4245
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:49,653
and enjoying watching, 
this fight go down.

4246
03:27:49,653 --> 03:27:51,719
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yes! Amazing.

4247
03:27:51,719 --> 03:27:53,365
MATT: And while no one here

4248
03:27:53,365 --> 03:27:56,499
can throw a punch
to really give you much of an issue, Grog,

4249
03:27:56,499 --> 03:27:59,003
it is fun to feel the energy again.

4250
03:27:59,003 --> 03:28:00,264
TRAVIS: Take a few, yes.
TALIESIN: Slap fight.

4251
03:28:00,264 --> 03:28:01,652
TRAVIS: I sell them a bit more
than they're worth.

4252
03:28:01,652 --> 03:28:04,235
(all laugh)

4253
03:28:04,235 --> 03:28:07,080
MATT: All right. As eventually,
the fight dies down,

4254
03:28:07,080 --> 03:28:10,026
another round of drinks are purchased
by those who are involved.

4255
03:28:10,026 --> 03:28:14,550
You all find yourselves
now into the late, late hours.

4256
03:28:14,550 --> 03:28:17,372
Once again, probably pushing
another sunrise in the next hour or so.

4257
03:28:17,372 --> 03:28:19,783
You gather you
should probably find yourselves to rest.

4258
03:28:19,783 --> 03:28:23,118
TALIESIN: Sleep, then leave.
Sleep, then leave.

4259
03:28:23,118 --> 03:28:25,280
ASHLEY: I give Grog a big hug and say,

4260
03:28:25,280 --> 03:28:27,320
ASHLEY: You're my big brother, yeah?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4261
03:28:27,320 --> 03:28:28,320
ASHLEY: Please be safe.

4262
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:31,017
TRAVIS: I will. We're the original O.G.,
you know that?

4263
03:28:31,017 --> 03:28:32,683
ASHLEY: Yeah, we're the original O.G.

4264
03:28:32,683 --> 03:28:35,041
TRAVIS: Well, I guess original and O
is redundant, but -

4265
03:28:35,041 --> 03:28:36,430
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4266
03:28:36,430 --> 03:28:38,013
ASHLEY: Original Original G.

4267
03:28:38,013 --> 03:28:40,770
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're the O-O-G.

4268
03:28:40,770 --> 03:28:42,369
ASHLEY: Oo-G. Oog.

4269
03:28:42,369 --> 03:28:43,347
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4270
03:28:46,327 --> 03:28:48,685
MATT: You guys make your way
back to Whitestone castle.

4271
03:28:48,685 --> 03:28:51,253
Find a full evening's sleep.

4272
03:28:51,253 --> 03:28:57,226
Eventually, the late morning,
early afternoon comes about.

4273
03:28:57,226 --> 03:29:01,369
You're well-rested,
and a night of good dreams come to you.

4274
03:29:01,369 --> 03:29:05,674
In contrast to the bad night before,
you do manage to get full rest.

4275
03:29:05,674 --> 03:29:12,314
[no audio]

4276
03:29:12,314 --> 03:29:13,530
LIAM: - into my sister's room

4277
03:29:13,530 --> 03:29:17,720
with a bowl of lukewarm lentil soup,
and go,

4278
03:29:17,720 --> 03:29:19,855
"Oh, god, I'm still sick.
(vomit noises)"

4279
03:29:19,855 --> 03:29:20,910
LAURA: No, no!
ASHLEY: (laughs)

4280
03:29:20,910 --> 03:29:21,975
LIAM: And throw it all over her.

4281
03:29:21,975 --> 03:29:24,360
LAURA: You're such an asshole.

4282
03:29:24,360 --> 03:29:27,413
LIAM: Whoo! Still got it, baby!

4283
03:29:27,413 --> 03:29:29,024
And I run back to my room
and go to bed.

4284
03:29:29,024 --> 03:29:30,766
MATT: (giggles)

4285
03:29:30,766 --> 03:29:34,618
LAURA: I go take a shower.

4286
03:29:34,618 --> 03:29:35,754
(all laugh)

4287
03:29:35,754 --> 03:29:38,621
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh!
Can I find Pike? And I say,

4288
03:29:38,621 --> 03:29:40,160
"Hey, wait. Before I go,

4289
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:43,555
"do you want me
to keep a special eye on Scanlan,

4290
03:29:43,555 --> 03:29:45,791
"since he proposed marriage?"

4291
03:29:45,791 --> 03:29:51,771
ASHLEY: Oh. Well,
that offer is off the table.

4292
03:29:51,771 --> 03:29:53,141
TRAVIS: What?

4293
03:29:53,141 --> 03:29:57,752
ASHLEY: Oh.
It's not happening anymore.

4294
03:29:57,752 --> 03:29:58,851
TRAVIS: Oh.

4295
03:29:58,851 --> 03:30:04,681
ASHLEY: So, yeah, he's free
to have some good times

4296
03:30:04,681 --> 03:30:09,786
at the old "lady houses"
that you guys like to visit.

4297
03:30:09,786 --> 03:30:11,866
The lady spas?

4298
03:30:11,866 --> 03:30:14,526
(all laugh)

4299
03:30:14,526 --> 03:30:17,239
MARISHA: Lady spas?!
TALIESIN: Lady spas?

4300
03:30:17,239 --> 03:30:18,821
ASHLEY: Whorehouses?

4301
03:30:18,821 --> 03:30:21,767
(all laugh)

4302
03:30:21,767 --> 03:30:24,034
LIAM: I'd rather go to the lady spas.

4303
03:30:24,034 --> 03:30:25,629
ASHLEY: You know what?

4304
03:30:25,629 --> 03:30:30,088
I think he's not quite ready.
I think it was just the idea of it.

4305
03:30:30,088 --> 03:30:30,956
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4306
03:30:30,956 --> 03:30:34,329
ASHLEY: The idea of me.
Because I'm just really great.

4307
03:30:34,329 --> 03:30:36,245
TRAVIS: I mean, you really are.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4308
03:30:36,245 --> 03:30:37,516
TRAVIS: He got a little swept up,
carried away.

4309
03:30:37,516 --> 03:30:38,646
ASHLEY: Yeah, he did. It happens.

4310
03:30:38,646 --> 03:30:41,329
TRAVIS: Is there anybody
I should keep a special eye on?

4311
03:30:41,329 --> 03:30:43,947
(all laugh)

4312
03:30:43,947 --> 03:30:45,823
SAM: Yes!
TALIESIN: Wow, just -

4313
03:30:45,823 --> 03:30:51,750
ASHLEY: Oh. I have my eye on one already.

4314
03:30:51,750 --> 03:30:53,151
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah?

4315
03:30:53,151 --> 03:30:53,980
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4316
03:30:53,980 --> 03:30:54,999
TRAVIS: Like, magically?

4317
03:30:54,999 --> 03:30:55,969
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4318
03:30:55,969 --> 03:30:57,239
TRAVIS: All right.

4319
03:30:57,239 --> 03:30:59,967
ASHLEY: Yeah. It's fine.
TRAVIS: You just let me know.

4320
03:30:59,967 --> 03:31:02,049
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: I'm an extra layer of protection.

4321
03:31:02,049 --> 03:31:07,286
ASHLEY: Yeah. Well. Just be careful.
Keep yourself safe.

4322
03:31:07,286 --> 03:31:08,652
TRAVIS: Me?
ASHLEY: Yeah!

4323
03:31:08,652 --> 03:31:09,926
TRAVIS: That's never part of the plan.

4324
03:31:09,926 --> 03:31:13,086
ASHLEY: Well, just don't make
too crazy of decisions.

4325
03:31:13,086 --> 03:31:14,010
TRAVIS: All right. Hey!

4326
03:31:14,010 --> 03:31:16,294
When I come back,
those Gauntlets of Ogre Strength?

4327
03:31:16,294 --> 03:31:17,167
ASHLEY: Yeah?

4328
03:31:17,167 --> 03:31:19,842
TRAVIS: I wanna see 'em super beat up.

4329
03:31:19,842 --> 03:31:20,641
ASHLEY: Okay.

4330
03:31:20,641 --> 03:31:23,876
TRAVIS: Okay. We'll compare damage box.
ASHLEY: (doosh doosh doosh doosh doosh)

4331
03:31:23,876 --> 03:31:24,935
TRAVIS: (buuh)

4332
03:31:27,815 --> 03:31:30,227
LAURA: I run up behind Pike
out of my shower

4333
03:31:30,227 --> 03:31:32,092
and I twirl her around

4334
03:31:32,092 --> 03:31:33,793
and I give you a big old hug
and a kiss on the cheek.

4335
03:31:33,793 --> 03:31:36,286
ASHLEY: Oh. Ohh.
LAURA: We'll be back soon, darling.

4336
03:31:36,286 --> 03:31:38,436
ASHLEY: Okay. I hope so.
LAURA: Take care of everything.

4337
03:31:38,436 --> 03:31:40,583
ASHLEY: All right.
LAURA: I ought to get dressed.

4338
03:31:40,583 --> 03:31:44,245
ASHLEY: Yeah, will you - yeah. Okay.

4339
03:31:44,245 --> 03:31:48,390
(all laugh)

4340
03:31:48,390 --> 03:31:51,247
MATT: The flushed gnome runs off.

4341
03:31:51,247 --> 03:31:54,185
You guys all eventually
gather your materials,

4342
03:31:54,185 --> 03:31:56,065
your weapons, your equipment,

4343
03:31:56,065 --> 03:31:58,268
and anything else
you need for the journey,

4344
03:31:58,268 --> 03:32:03,094
and you all meet just on the outside
of the front doors to Whitestone castle

4345
03:32:03,094 --> 03:32:04,242
for a final goodbye.

4346
03:32:04,242 --> 03:32:10,636
There waiting for you:
Allura, the Realmseer, and Gilmore.

4347
03:32:10,636 --> 03:32:12,883
Kima's off elsewhere right now.

4348
03:32:12,883 --> 03:32:16,412
And Cassandra follows up behind
as you guys step out.

4349
03:32:16,412 --> 03:32:20,080
They all nod their heads.

4350
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:22,823
Allura walks over to you
and pats you on the shoulder.

4351
03:32:22,823 --> 03:32:26,244
"Don't worry.
Have faith, and when you return.

4352
03:32:26,244 --> 03:32:31,067
"I'll know how to absolve you
of this cursed individual.

4353
03:32:31,067 --> 03:32:33,893
"And I think you'll have, hopefully,

4354
03:32:33,893 --> 03:32:36,546
"something else even more helpful
in your midst."

4355
03:32:38,586 --> 03:32:42,553
Cassandra comes up by you
and rests her chin on your shoulder.

4356
03:32:44,913 --> 03:32:47,038
"Percy, stay alive, please."

4357
03:32:47,038 --> 03:32:49,632
TALIESIN: All right. (sighs)

4358
03:32:49,632 --> 03:32:51,233
MATT: "I mean it."

4359
03:32:51,233 --> 03:32:54,810
TALIESIN: I know. I plan on coming back.
I'm not done.

4360
03:32:54,810 --> 03:32:56,425
MATT: "No, you're not."

4361
03:32:56,425 --> 03:32:58,807
And she smacks you in the face. (dshh)

4362
03:32:58,807 --> 03:32:59,696
TALIESIN: (sighs) I hate you.

4363
03:32:59,696 --> 03:33:03,570
MATT: Once everyone else is looking,
she rights herself again.

4364
03:33:03,570 --> 03:33:06,226
She takes her coat
and buttons it there in the middle.

4365
03:33:09,036 --> 03:33:13,098
"I cannot express, truly,

4366
03:33:13,098 --> 03:33:18,146
"how important
your influence has been in this city,

4367
03:33:18,146 --> 03:33:20,945
"and I don't think you realize

4368
03:33:20,945 --> 03:33:24,979
"just how many lives here
are for the better

4369
03:33:24,979 --> 03:33:29,612
"since you've
walked into our humble home.

4370
03:33:29,612 --> 03:33:34,491
"And it is for that reason 
that I request,

4371
03:33:34,491 --> 03:33:37,033
"on the behalf
of all of us here in Whitestone,

4372
03:33:37,033 --> 03:33:41,602
"that you come back safe.

4373
03:33:41,602 --> 03:33:46,097
"That is all. Good luck."

4374
03:33:46,097 --> 03:33:50,598
She puts her shoulders back
and walks back into the castle.

4375
03:33:50,598 --> 03:33:52,874
TALIESIN: At your service, Lord Cassandra.

4376
03:33:52,874 --> 03:33:54,972
MATT: "Don't call me that."
TALIESIN: (laughs)

4377
03:33:54,972 --> 03:33:57,220
MATT: She walks back in.

4378
03:33:59,260 --> 03:34:02,660
ASHLEY: I put my shoulders back
and do the same thing she does.

4379
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:04,096
And turn around and wave.

4380
03:34:04,096 --> 03:34:06,003
ASHLEY: I love you guys. (blows kiss)
MARISHA: Bye, Pike.

4381
03:34:06,003 --> 03:34:07,777
LAURA: Bye, Lord Pike.
TRAVIS: Bye, Pike.

4382
03:34:07,777 --> 03:34:09,230
ASHLEY: Bye.
VEX AND ASHLEY: (laugh)

4383
03:34:09,230 --> 03:34:10,289
LIAM: Bye, Pickle.

4384
03:34:10,289 --> 03:34:12,291
ASHLEY: Bye, Vaxy.

4385
03:34:12,291 --> 03:34:14,581
MATT: Allura and Gilmore
look at each other.

4386
03:34:14,581 --> 03:34:17,047
Allura nods
and walks in the castle after Pike,

4387
03:34:17,047 --> 03:34:18,666
leaving Gilmore there.

4388
03:34:18,666 --> 03:34:20,342
Gilmore looks at you all.

4389
03:34:24,402 --> 03:34:27,443
"Sorry about forgetting the hug
last time. It wasn't my intent."

4390
03:34:27,443 --> 03:34:29,328
LAURA: (laughs) Totally fine, dear.

4391
03:34:37,328 --> 03:34:40,082
MATT: "I have no words.
You all look fabulous.

4392
03:34:41,872 --> 03:34:45,616
"If you find anything really amazing
that you don't need,

4393
03:34:45,616 --> 03:34:47,573
"I'm trying to build up stock again.

4394
03:34:47,573 --> 03:34:51,133
"(chuckling) I kind of...
lost two shops in the same month."

4395
03:34:51,133 --> 03:34:52,778
LAURA: Are you building another shop?

4396
03:34:52,778 --> 03:34:54,401
MATT: "Well, I mean, eventually.

4397
03:34:54,401 --> 03:34:56,964
"You've got to have long-term plans,
my dear."

4398
03:34:56,964 --> 03:34:58,495
LAURA: Of course.
We'll keep promoting you, then.

4399
03:34:58,495 --> 03:35:02,004
MATT: "Please. I'm far beyond
the adventuring business,

4400
03:35:02,004 --> 03:35:06,110
"and income's been stale for a while.

4401
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:11,899
"But stay safe. Be careful.
It's weird out there."

4402
03:35:11,899 --> 03:35:13,350
SAM: (laughs)

4403
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:15,647
MATT: "Very, very weird out there."

4404
03:35:15,647 --> 03:35:17,126
LAURA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: So true.

4405
03:35:17,126 --> 03:35:18,049
MARISHA: Thank you, Gilmore.

4406
03:35:18,049 --> 03:35:21,819
TRAVIS: Should we -
since they're all smart and stuff -

4407
03:35:21,819 --> 03:35:24,436
ask them anything in particular
about the Feywild?

4408
03:35:24,436 --> 03:35:29,143
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
Any last words of wisdom for the Feywild?

4409
03:35:29,143 --> 03:35:31,999
MATT: "It's WEIRD out there."

4410
03:35:31,999 --> 03:35:33,289
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Thank you.

4411
03:35:33,289 --> 03:35:34,517
TRAVIS: Deep.
MARISHA: I think that was it.

4412
03:35:34,517 --> 03:35:35,698
MATT: "Take everything with caution.

4413
03:35:35,698 --> 03:35:37,404
"Trust nothing.

4414
03:35:37,404 --> 03:35:42,696
"Keep your eyes open
and for the love of god,

4415
03:35:45,466 --> 03:35:49,216
"absolve yourself
of any preconceptions."

4416
03:35:49,216 --> 03:35:52,530
TRAVIS: Shit. Okay.
MARISHA: All right.

4417
03:35:52,530 --> 03:35:54,466
MATT: "Fly high, my bird."

4418
03:35:54,466 --> 03:35:55,947
MARISHA: Oh.

4419
03:35:55,947 --> 03:35:57,665
MATT: He walks up
and gives you a kiss on the cheek,

4420
03:35:57,665 --> 03:35:59,931
and then walks into the castle
after the rest.

4421
03:35:59,931 --> 03:36:01,089
MARISHA: Oh.

4422
03:36:01,089 --> 03:36:03,022
TALIESIN: (quietly) See?
That wasn't so hard, was it?

4423
03:36:03,022 --> 03:36:04,989
MARISHA: (whispering) Hush, Percy.

4424
03:36:07,739 --> 03:36:09,014
LAURA: Well.

4425
03:36:09,014 --> 03:36:10,159
SAM: Shall we?

4426
03:36:10,159 --> 03:36:11,806
LAURA: Oh, god. It's happening.

4427
03:36:11,806 --> 03:36:15,597
MARISHA: All form a circle and hold hands.

4428
03:36:15,607 --> 03:36:16,869
LIAM: All right.

4429
03:36:16,869 --> 03:36:19,705
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah,
let's actually do it, yeah.

4430
03:36:19,705 --> 03:36:21,530
LAURA: Oh, it's really -
LIAM: We're really doing it.

4431
03:36:21,530 --> 03:36:23,367
ASHLEY: I'm not here.
LAURA: Oh, Pike's not here.

4432
03:36:23,367 --> 03:36:24,330
LIAM: Ready, Stubby?

4433
03:36:24,330 --> 03:36:25,879
LAURA: Hum - oh, yes.

4434
03:36:25,879 --> 03:36:27,307
MARISHA: All right, everyone.
Close your eyes.

4435
03:36:27,307 --> 03:36:28,620
SAM: Do we have
to say a magic word?

4436
03:36:28,620 --> 03:36:30,603
MARISHA: No. Just close your eyes.
It helps -

4437
03:36:30,603 --> 03:36:31,712
SAM: Can we say a magic word?

4438
03:36:31,712 --> 03:36:33,625
MARISHA: If it makes you feel better,
Scanlan.

4439
03:36:33,625 --> 03:36:34,392
SAM: All right.

4440
03:36:34,392 --> 03:36:35,693
MARISHA: Close your eyes.
It helps with the nausea.

4441
03:36:35,693 --> 03:36:36,808
TALIESIN: You could sing.

4442
03:36:36,808 --> 03:36:38,783
MARISHA: And -

4443
03:36:38,783 --> 03:36:41,737
SAM, MARISHA, AND LIAM:
(gibberish noises)

4444
03:36:41,737 --> 03:36:44,416
(laughter)

4445
03:36:44,416 --> 03:36:45,450
LAURA: My pretty!

4446
03:36:45,450 --> 03:36:46,909
SAM: Wait, did it happen already?
We're still here.

4447
03:36:46,909 --> 03:36:48,860
MARISHA: My pretty!
LAURA: (cackles)

4448
03:36:48,860 --> 03:36:52,872
MATT: Where are you specifying?
Where are you going?

4449
03:36:52,872 --> 03:36:55,098
LIAM: (Brooklyn accent)
We're going to Florida!

4450
03:36:55,098 --> 03:36:56,685
(cheers)

4451
03:36:56,685 --> 03:36:58,725
MARISHA: We're going to Disney!
TALIESIN: Harry Potter Land!

4452
03:36:58,725 --> 03:37:01,340
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Harry Potter Land!

4453
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:03,265
TRAVIS: (laughing) Epcot Center.

4454
03:37:03,265 --> 03:37:05,972
MARISHA: I'm going to go
to the one place I know,

4455
03:37:05,972 --> 03:37:09,832
which is the portal
just beyond where Grog entered.

4456
03:37:09,832 --> 03:37:12,121
MATT: You haven't been in there.

4457
03:37:12,121 --> 03:37:16,013
MARISHA: But I know
that there's a portal there, right?

4458
03:37:16,013 --> 03:37:19,335
TRAVIS: There was a lake
in the middle of the -

4459
03:37:19,335 --> 03:37:20,922
LIAM: Yeah, Grog's girlfriend.

4460
03:37:20,922 --> 03:37:23,009
MARISHA: Grog's girlfriend.

4461
03:37:23,009 --> 03:37:24,919
SAM: But we weren't in the Feywild,
were we?

4462
03:37:24,919 --> 03:37:26,502
TRAVIS: No, no,
it's a portal to the Feywild.

4463
03:37:26,502 --> 03:37:28,604
MARISHA: No, but I've got a vague idea.
MATT: Okay.

4464
03:37:28,604 --> 03:37:30,816
MARISHA: Can I talk to - hang on, wait.

4465
03:37:30,816 --> 03:37:31,870
MARISHA: Grog!
TRAVIS: What?

4466
03:37:31,870 --> 03:37:34,109
MARISHA: Remember your girlfriend
in the Feywild?

4467
03:37:34,109 --> 03:37:37,273
TRAVIS: Pfft. Yeah.

4468
03:37:37,273 --> 03:37:40,445
MARISHA: Think about her and that place
very, very hard.

4469
03:37:40,445 --> 03:37:42,720
TRAVIS: Which part?

4470
03:37:42,720 --> 03:37:44,104
MARISHA: Going there.

4471
03:37:44,104 --> 03:37:45,366
LAURA: Oh, it's happening?
It's happening.

4472
03:37:45,366 --> 03:37:47,197
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I thought we already -

4473
03:37:47,197 --> 03:37:48,879
MARISHA: Think about Grog's girlfriend.

4474
03:37:48,879 --> 03:37:50,051
TRAVIS: Peanut butter and jelly.

4475
03:37:50,051 --> 03:37:51,515
LIAM: What did they do in there?
We don't know, still.

4476
03:37:51,515 --> 03:37:52,557
MARISHA: We don't know.

4477
03:37:52,557 --> 03:37:53,385
SAM: Maybe we'll find out!

4478
03:37:53,385 --> 03:37:57,060
MATT: For a moment,
there's just this still quiet,

4479
03:37:57,060 --> 03:38:00,607
and then this very cold breeze

4480
03:38:00,607 --> 03:38:04,013
begins to pick up
around your feet (wind noise)

4481
03:38:04,013 --> 03:38:08,745
and it's like someone smacked each of you
on your back really hard (boomf).

4482
03:38:08,745 --> 03:38:13,506
And with that,
your vision flashes for a moment,

4483
03:38:13,506 --> 03:38:18,277
and you look about
and everything has changed.

4484
03:38:18,277 --> 03:38:21,795
You step forward
into the now-temperate air.

4485
03:38:21,795 --> 03:38:23,961
You're struck immediately

4486
03:38:23,961 --> 03:38:28,069
by the vibrant purples, blues, and pinks
of a sunset sky

4487
03:38:28,069 --> 03:38:30,064
that envelops the clouds above you,

4488
03:38:30,064 --> 03:38:33,527
just above the treeline
that surrounds you.

4489
03:38:33,527 --> 03:38:38,162
The smell of fresh morning dew
and poppy upon the breeze

4490
03:38:38,162 --> 03:38:40,928
rolls past your nose and fills your senses

4491
03:38:40,928 --> 03:38:43,376
as you look down and see yourself wading

4492
03:38:43,376 --> 03:38:48,931
through what looks like two-foot-tall,
knee- to thigh-high grass.

4493
03:38:52,691 --> 03:38:56,605
Vine-covered tree trunks wrap
and rise around you,

4494
03:38:56,605 --> 03:39:01,567
curling as they stretch upward
like a bending dreamscape

4495
03:39:01,567 --> 03:39:03,493
of hundreds of small bobbing fairy lights

4496
03:39:03,493 --> 03:39:06,249
that float in the shadowed distance
of the forest.

4497
03:39:06,249 --> 03:39:11,793
You can see what looks to be
a few small pools of water

4498
03:39:11,793 --> 03:39:15,541
that have gathered in this small glade
that surrounds you.

4499
03:39:17,361 --> 03:39:19,120
And that's where
we'll pick up next week.

4500
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:20,755
ASHLEY: Oh.
LAURA: It sounds beautiful.

4501
03:39:20,755 --> 03:39:22,423
MATT: Or two weeks from now, I guess.

4502
03:39:22,423 --> 03:39:23,955
LAURA: Oh, man, that's right.
ASHLEY: Boo.

4503
03:39:23,955 --> 03:39:25,499
TRAVIS: But we'll be back.
We'll do stuff next week.

4504
03:39:25,499 --> 03:39:26,759
MATT: You guys'll be back next week
for your own little fun time.

4505
03:39:26,759 --> 03:39:27,707
LAURA: Yeah, we'll do something.

4506
03:39:27,707 --> 03:39:30,652
MATT: We'll be back to pick up that line,
as the party enters the Feywild,

4507
03:39:30,652 --> 03:39:31,723
in two weeks.

4508
03:39:31,723 --> 03:39:37,153
TALIESIN: Man.
SAM: Who knows what we'll encounter.

4509
03:39:37,153 --> 03:39:38,698
MATT: It's going to be real interesting
here in the Feywild.

4510
03:39:38,698 --> 03:39:42,214
All right, so first and foremost,

4511
03:39:42,214 --> 03:39:44,498
thanks again to Loot Crate
for being our awesome sponsors.

4512
03:39:44,498 --> 03:39:46,943
TRAVIS: We're wearing
these awesome shirts.

4513
03:39:46,943 --> 03:39:47,949
Keyleth's got one. I'm rocking -

4514
03:39:47,949 --> 03:39:49,353
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone's
been tweeting at me,

4515
03:39:49,353 --> 03:39:50,774
asking "where did you get
your awesome shirt?"

4516
03:39:50,774 --> 03:39:52,063
Uh, LOOT CRATE, what.

4517
03:39:52,063 --> 03:39:55,968
ASHLEY: Loot Crate!
TRAVIS: Alex Murphy, RoboCop, holla.

4518
03:39:55,968 --> 03:39:58,186
LIAM: And our discount!

4519
03:39:58,186 --> 03:40:01,646
MATT: And Ashley,
if you hadn't picked up at this point,

4520
03:40:01,646 --> 03:40:05,024
is going back to New York
to shoot on the next season of Blindspot.

4521
03:40:05,024 --> 03:40:06,677
LIAM: No! No!
LAURA: Oh, no...

4522
03:40:06,677 --> 03:40:08,228
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, hold on a second.
SAM: Wait, what does she have?

4523
03:40:08,228 --> 03:40:11,858
ASHLEY: Guys, for those of you
in the Critter community

4524
03:40:11,858 --> 03:40:13,803
who made this amazing quilt.

4525
03:40:13,803 --> 03:40:17,833
This is going to come with me
and be on my bed, and I'll snuggle it.

4526
03:40:17,833 --> 03:40:19,832
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's amazing!

4527
03:40:19,832 --> 03:40:22,260
LAURA: They made her
the most amazing quilt!

4528
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:23,808
ASHLEY: I love this so much.
SAM: Is that a Pike quilt?

4529
03:40:23,808 --> 03:40:24,754
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: Yes, it is.

4530
03:40:24,754 --> 03:40:27,064
LAURA: And it's got art.
ASHLEY: It has all the art on it -

4531
03:40:27,064 --> 03:40:30,788
ASHLEY: - and then on the sides
it's just little quotes and things.

4532
03:40:30,788 --> 03:40:34,495
TRAVIS: Aim long, strike true,
a War God's Blessing upon you.

4533
03:40:34,495 --> 03:40:36,289
ASHLEY: People wrote on Twitter
LAURA: It's so amazing.

4534
03:40:36,289 --> 03:40:37,976
MARISHA: That's amazing!
TRAVIS: So many good messages.

4535
03:40:37,976 --> 03:40:41,591
ASHLEY: Never stop being yourself.
You empower others to be themselves -

4536
03:40:41,591 --> 03:40:43,179
oh, okay, now I'm just reading, like -

4537
03:40:43,179 --> 03:40:45,369
(all laugh)

4538
03:40:45,369 --> 03:40:47,190
ASHLEY: I thought it was going to be -

4539
03:40:47,190 --> 03:40:49,554
I wasn't trying
to read compliments about myself.

4540
03:40:49,554 --> 03:40:51,709
(all laugh)

4541
03:40:51,709 --> 03:40:54,026
MATT: I love this blanket.
It tells me how awesome I am.

4542
03:40:54,026 --> 03:40:56,113
TRAVIS: I like your hair!
LAURA: I'm pretty awesome.

4543
03:40:56,113 --> 03:40:58,732
ASHLEY: Your hair's great! I love it.

4544
03:40:58,732 --> 03:41:02,390
LIAM: Us pack of nerds
are going to miss you

4545
03:41:02,390 --> 03:41:04,635
more than Vox Machina misses Pike.

4546
03:41:04,635 --> 03:41:06,007
ASHLEY: Oh, goodness.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

4547
03:41:06,007 --> 03:41:07,029
LIAM: We're going to miss you.

4548
03:41:07,029 --> 03:41:08,080
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys
so much.

4549
03:41:08,080 --> 03:41:09,374
TRAVIS: We're going to steal you back
whenever we can.

4550
03:41:09,374 --> 03:41:11,754
MATT: We got better internet
in the studio for you.

4551
03:41:11,754 --> 03:41:13,172
LAURA: Yeah, it's true.
ASHLEY: What's he say, again?

4552
03:41:13,172 --> 03:41:15,403
MATT: We got better internet
in the studio specifically for you.

4553
03:41:15,403 --> 03:41:17,337
LAURA: So it'll be faster.
ASHLEY: Okay. All right.

4554
03:41:17,337 --> 03:41:18,542
MATT: When you can, Skype in.

4555
03:41:18,542 --> 03:41:20,458
ASHLEY: All right. When I can, Skype in.

4556
03:41:20,458 --> 03:41:22,590
MATT: I know it's not the same.

4557
03:41:22,590 --> 03:41:25,372
ASHLEY: Astral projection Pike. (laughs)
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

4558
03:41:25,372 --> 03:41:28,574
LAURA: No, no, no, you have the stone.
You'll be really there.

4559
03:41:28,574 --> 03:41:30,263
ASHLEY: Oh, I'll be really there.
That's right. That's right. Yes.

4560
03:41:30,263 --> 03:41:32,015
We're going to make it work.

4561
03:41:32,015 --> 03:41:33,991
MATT: I'll make it work.

4562
03:41:33,991 --> 03:41:40,400
ASHLEY: Matt will have to make it -
MATT: I'll figure it out. It's my job.

4563
03:41:40,400 --> 03:41:43,810
LIAM: Pike in a box
is better than no Pike.

4564
03:41:43,810 --> 03:41:46,037
MATT, TALIESIN, AND MARISHA: 
(singing) It's a Pike in a box, ooh.

4565
03:41:46,037 --> 03:41:47,076
ASHLEY: It's a Pike in a box!

4566
03:41:47,076 --> 03:41:48,749
MATT, MARISHA, TALIESIN, AND LAURA:
(singing) Pike in a box, baaabe.

4567
03:41:48,749 --> 03:41:50,733
(singing peters out)

4568
03:41:50,733 --> 03:41:55,178
MATT: (singing) Step one, put a hole
in that box… put a Pike in that box?

4569
03:41:55,178 --> 03:41:56,401
MARISHA: Oh, god!

4570
03:41:56,401 --> 03:41:58,124
MATT: Not continuing the song...

4571
03:41:58,124 --> 03:41:59,873
(all laugh)

4572
03:41:59,873 --> 03:42:01,185
MATT: Guys,
thank you so much for watching.

4573
03:42:01,185 --> 03:42:03,191
I hope you enjoyed your time.

4574
03:42:03,191 --> 03:42:06,052
Looking forward to seeing all you folks
in Australia next week.

4575
03:42:06,052 --> 03:42:08,754
It's going to be awesome.
We'll see you guys Saturday night.

4576
03:42:08,754 --> 03:42:10,451
I believe it'll be Taliesin, Marisha -

4577
03:42:10,451 --> 03:42:12,024
MARISHA AND TALIESIN:
Not Taliesin.

4578
03:42:12,024 --> 03:42:15,493
MATT: Not Taliesin, sorry.
Liam, Marisha, Laura, and Travis

4579
03:42:15,493 --> 03:42:17,494
are going to play some Deadlands
for a couple of hours

4580
03:42:17,494 --> 03:42:18,575
on our awesome charity stream.

4590
03:42:39,144 --> 03:42:42,726
My apologies.
I've had a lot on my mind today.

4591
03:42:42,726 --> 03:42:46,251
But yeah. So we'll see you guys
throughout the stream.

4592
03:42:46,251 --> 03:42:48,684
Until then, is it Thursday yet?

4593
03:42:48,684 --> 03:42:50,690
Have a good night, guys.
