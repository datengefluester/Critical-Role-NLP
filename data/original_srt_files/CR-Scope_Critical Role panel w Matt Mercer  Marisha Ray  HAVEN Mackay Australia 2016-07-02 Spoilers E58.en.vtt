00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.109
[dramatic music]

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.229
(cheering)

00:00:16.229 --> 00:01:33.080
(Critical Role theme music)

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.870
(cheering)

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:43.184
MODERATOR: Hey.

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:43.974
MATT: Hi!

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:47.032
MODERATOR: So that was cool.

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:51.767
MARISHA: I've never seen it so big! That's 
what she said. Oh, that's so great.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:53.077
MATT: After 4 PM.

00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:55.308
MARISHA: After 4 PM!

00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:59.143
MODERATOR: All right, guys, this is the panel
you've all been waiting for. It is about a little

00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:02.223
show called Critical Role. Have you heard of it?

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.472
(cheering)

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:09.897
MODERATOR: Some of you have heard of it. That's
good. That's cool. Joining us, two of the stars,

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:19.504
and the dungeon master himself, Mr. Matthew
Mercer! And the lovely Marisha Ray!

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:25.263
MARISHA: And joining me is this glass of Shiraz.
Yay, Shiraz!

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:27.758
MATT: Biggest cheer.

00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:32.462
MODERATOR: We're going to start, dive right into
it. There is going to be time at the end for you

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:40.236
guys to ask your questions, so figure them out in
your head, hold onto them. So. Do you guys

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:44.362
remember your first ever D&D character?

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:45.703
MARISHA: I do!

00:02:45.703 --> 00:02:47.931
MODERATOR: Tell us about it.

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:53.218
MARISHA: My first ever D&D character was actually
with this guy. He was my first dungeon master.

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:56.575
Once you go Matt Mercer?

00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:01.415
(laughter)

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:05.045
MATT: Sure. I'll allow it.

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:10.537
MARISHA: I had never played before, because I grew
up in a small town in Kentucky, where Dungeons &

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:13.767
Dragons was a ritual cult, or something.

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:16.411
MATT and MARISHA: It's the devil!

00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:25.953
MARISHA: I came out to Los Angeles, and he ran a
one-shot for me, and I made a controller ranger.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:37.380
It was Fourth Edition, and she was a ranger that
would cast control spells.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.447
MATT: I think it was a drow, too.

00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:47.249
MARISHA: She was a drow, yeah. Drow ranger
controller caster. It was cool. I had bats. I had

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.583
a lot of bats. I would make AoE's filled with
bats. That's what I remember.

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:55.702
MATT and MARISHA: Bats.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:04:00.830
MATT: My first character was less cool. I'd been
brought into a Second Edition D&D game in high

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.018
school. They're like, "Play whatever you want!"
I'm like, "I want to be a wizard! I want to be a

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:10.613
"Gandalf wizard who uses his sword. How can I do
that?" Well, there's this militant wizard kit. Oh,

00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:16.044
cool, I'll use that! As such, I made a wizard that
wasn't as good at magic, and was really terrible

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:22.443
with a sword. He didn't last very long. His name
was Ameridus Trent, named after the Xanth

00:04:22.443 --> 00:04:27.536
character, and it was a terrible, terrible
character. But! You learn from your mistakes! To

00:04:27.536 --> 00:04:31.878
this day, he has a special place in my heart, to
not make a wizard that uses swords.

00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:34.096
(laughter)

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:39.205
MODERATOR: We all know Critical Role for what it
has become now, but where did it start? What was

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.961
the first thing that brought this show to us?

00:04:41.961 --> 00:04:50.137
MATT: Before it was a show, it was just our home
game for a little over two years. I'd been running

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:55.695
different campaigns for years, off and on, and
Liam O'Brien loved D&D when he was a kid, but

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.874
hadn't played in many, many years.

00:04:57.874 --> 00:05:01.470
I'd been threatening all through the time we
were working on Resident Evil together, saying,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.405
"Hey man, you want to play D&D, let me know."
Finally, as part of a birthday celebration, he was

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:10.529
like, "All right, go ahead and run a game, we'll
bring some people over." That's where we brought

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:17.473
Taliesin in, dragged Laura, Travis, and Sam, who
had never, ever played before. Most of the players

00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:22.840
who came in had never played, so we began running
a home game from that one-shot, and it turned into

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.714
a campaign that was ongoing.

00:05:24.714 --> 00:05:30.620
MARISHA: I actually didn't play that first game,
because no one else had played. I was there as

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:39.226
assistant coach, assistant to the dungeon master.
I went around and would help the characters.

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:43.232
I basically just pointed to their stat sheets
whenever they were confused on what to roll.

00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:47.464
MODERATOR: Can you come to my place, and just do
that? I mean that.

00:05:47.464 --> 00:05:51.141
MARISHA: Just pointing over people's shoulders.
"Where's my damage?!" "Right there."

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:54.130
MATT: You were essentially Microsoft Word's Clippy
of D&D.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.447
MARISHA: I was totally Clippy.

00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:58.577
MATT: It looks like you have a strength bonus
right there!

00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:00.840
MARISHA: Don't forget your advantage!

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.112
MATT: Exactly. We played on our own for two years,
and then word got around in the industry about a

00:06:07.112 --> 00:06:10.977
bunch of voice actors playing D&D, and people were
like, "That sounds pretty nerdy?" and we were

00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:16.204
like, "Damn right." Eventually Felicia Day
contacted us, through Ashley Johnson, and she was

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:21.115
like, "Hey, you guys ever thought about making
this into a show?" We're like--

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:22.800
MATT and MARISHA: No!

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.251
MATT: That sounds like a terrible idea!

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:25.451
MARISHA: No one would watch that shit.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.891
MATT: Yeah! And then, eventually, we were
like, well, we'll give it a shot and see if it

00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:33.015
works out, and we're all here now. That worked
out.

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:36.892
(cheering)

00:06:36.892 --> 00:06:41.080
MARISHA: We gave ourselves a promise that if we
hated it after six weeks and if it didn't take

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:49.186
off, we would quit and go back to playing at home.
No harm, no foul. We aren't losing anything,

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:56.518
really. Needless to say, that decision was not
made. Which I am very glad it was not made.

00:06:56.518 --> 00:07:02.461
MATT: Now we have CG video of Sam shooting a
lightning bolt out of his crotch. That's fun.

00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:05.467
MARISHA: It's funny how things work out.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:10.732
MODERATOR: How has the game changed since when it
was your home game to now being livestreamed to

00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:15.807
over 20,000 people at any given minute?

00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:21.991
MARISHA: Not a whole lot. Part of our stipulation
for making it a show is that we didn't want it to

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:30.220
change. We were in pre-production for six to eight
months with Geek and Sundry, because they were in

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.231
the same camp that we were in, where they thought
there's no way anyone's going want to to sit down

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:40.702
and watch people play Dungeons & Dragons for four
hours. They kept trying to make it more visual.

00:07:40.702 --> 00:07:47.344
One of the original ideas is that we would play to
a certain point in the campaign, then we would

00:07:47.344 --> 00:07:52.114
stop, then we would all jump on computers into an
MMO, like World of Warcraft, and then beat the

00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:59.329
boss in the MMO. We were like, "You don't know how
Dungeons & Dragons work. That-- no." Luckily it

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:01.672
didn't go that way.

00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:07.484
MATT: We had a while figuring out how the show
would work. We decided we would leave it up there,

00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:12.385
blemishes and all, all of its awkward stumbling
and us messing with the rules. Essentially just

00:08:12.385 --> 00:08:18.950
our game with cameras available. And it worked.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:24.489
MARISHA: The benefits are one, we're not waiting
in between games for six weeks. We only have a

00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:30.647
week so we can retain information a lot more.
Since we're on camera, it cut away from the

00:08:30.647 --> 00:08:37.485
side-table chatter that you have in a lot of your
games, where if one person's distracted with

00:08:37.485 --> 00:08:41.469
something, you're like, "Hey bro, how's work
going?"

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.708
MATT: Oh it sucks, my car broke down last weekend.
I was supposed to get it fixed. Oh, and I'm

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.120
rolling initiative.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.962
MARISHA: "Wait, what happened?" It cut down on a
lot of that, which was good. If anything, we're

00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:55.221
almost more engaged?

00:08:55.221 --> 00:09:00.589
MODERATOR: That's cool. Obviously you guys didn't
expect it to be the runaway success that it has

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:07.386
become. Your fans are incredible. I mean, they
create fanart, they cosplay, they're so engaged.

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:12.069
What's it like for you guys, especially seeing
someone--I know Matt, you used to be a

00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:16.603
cosplayer--seeing someone dressed up in costume as
the characters you guys are creating? What's that

00:09:16.603 --> 00:09:17.814
like for you?

00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:28.107
MATT: I don't know what's going on! It's crazy!
We're all crazy! So awesome! I-- it's seriously--

00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:32.136
MARISHA: There are no words. I don't know, man.

00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:37.637
MATT: If I told you how many times we've read the
response letters we've gotten from fans, and the

00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:45.459
heartfelt emails, and breaking down into tears
with the idea that people out there are either so

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:51.011
touched by our silly little game, or have gone on
and made their own home games and sent us pictures

00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:54.454
of their friends getting together on weekends and
playing, and how much it's affected their life and

00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:59.460
changed their life, that they've created their own
worlds. That's really the most I could have ever

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.491
hoped to create with this show, with all of us.

00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:09.313
MARISHA: It's forever overwhelming, and we'll say
repeatedly that Critical Role is not just the

00:10:09.313 --> 00:10:18.166
show. When we say Critical Role, we're not talking
about the stream that airs from seven to ten on

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:23.911
Thursday nights, we're talking about the fan art
and about the community, because if it wasn't for

00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:33.720
the fan art we wouldn't have visuals. The fan art
really does add so much more to the show.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.494
MATT: When we say fan art, that includes like, we
have a lot of wonderful musicians that write songs

00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:43.907
and music based on their inspiration from the
show. We have wonderful writers that write a lot

00:10:43.907 --> 00:10:48.182
of really awesome fan fiction, side stories within
the world they create on their own.

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:51.755
MARISHA: It's all so good, it's all so good.

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:55.565
MATT: All these people find different crafts and
different things that they're good at and find a

00:10:55.565 --> 00:11:00.966
way to take the inspiration and funnel it that way
and create something really cool and unique. We're

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:06.072
constantly beside ourselves and don't know how we
ever got so lucky to be even remotely involved in

00:11:06.072 --> 00:11:09.442
this wonderful chaos.

00:11:09.444 --> 00:11:13.721
MODERATOR: Can I get a show of hands if you've
ever made Critical Role fan art or cosplay, or

00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:18.258
written something, or engaged with the Critical
Role community?

00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:21.064
MARISHA: See, look at how many.

00:11:21.064 --> 00:11:22.762
MODERATOR: That's crazy.

00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:32.927
MARISHA: It accounts for 50% of what we are, for
sure. We're always so humbled. Not to go Keyleth

00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:41.897
on everybody here for a minute, but we're not
heroes, we're not special. We're just people and--

00:11:41.897 --> 00:11:43.917
MATT: You totally went Keyleth.

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:50.489
MARISHA: I did! But we're not! We're not. Just to
have anybody to say that we've moved them or

00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:55.565
affected them, it's like-- I'm going to stop
talking about it so I don't start crying on

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:57.183
stage.

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:59.820
MODERATOR: Just drink.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.380
MARISHA: I drink.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.085
MODERATOR: Matt, a question I think every DM in
the room wants to know is: how do you prepare for

00:12:05.085 --> 00:12:09.575
a session? How do you get that ready? What's the
process?

00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:20.242
MATT: It changes based on the story elements and
what's happening but I generally try and foresee

00:12:20.242 --> 00:12:27.386
possible directions the party may go based on what
happened in the last game. I'll consider those

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:32.747
paths. Maybe they'll go and-- this one story lead
I left them a while back, they'll pursue that in

00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:37.411
this direction, so I'll flesh out this path and
whatever NPC's they may come across, and possible

00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:44.993
encounters they may circumvent or go head on into,
and I'll prepare that from multiple different

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:51.142
avenues. I don't flesh it out too crazy because
most of that is going to go out the window the

00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:55.463
moment you play anyway because inevitably players
do the most random shit ever and you have no

00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:56.965
control anymore.

00:12:56.965 --> 00:12:58.155
MARISHA: Cows.

00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:00.088
(cheering)

00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:02.236
MARISHA: Proudest moment.

00:13:02.236 --> 00:13:07.867
MATT: I usually break it down in a Word document
and I'll have bullet points with major important

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:12.898
points of information, like if an NPC knows
certain key elements of a conversation they try to

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:16.891
draw out, I'll have notes on what they know and
what the players could find out if they ask the

00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:22.569
right questions. It's pretty loose, so I don't
feel like I put too much effort to have something

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:25.907
never come to light if it doesn't get used, and if
it does happen, a lot of the conversation is still

00:13:25.907 --> 00:13:30.109
improvised and I use those bullet points as points
of reference as they emerge.

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:37.033
MARISHA: A lot of people ask for your improv-ed
NPC's. Give a quick list of your improv-ed,

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:43.198
unexpected NPC's. Victor. Victor wasn't
expected--

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.126
MATT: There's a lot of them.

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:48.860
MARISHA: Kynan wasn't expected, right? No wait,
Kynan was.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.599
MATT: Kynan I prepared a little bit. There's a lot
of them.

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:53.600
MARISHA: There's so many that you weren't
expecting.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.532
MATT: I mean, technically-- there's too many to
list right now.

00:13:58.532 --> 00:14:00.521
MARISHA: Never mind.

00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:06.024
MATT: You caught me off guard with that one! There
are a lot of ones that are improvised when they

00:14:06.024 --> 00:14:09.919
first happened but I then fleshed them out once
they were created too so it's hard to remember

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:13.275
which ones started that way unless I go through a
list to consider it. It's okay, put me on the

00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:18.082
spot, it's fine. (deep voice) Matthew Mercer 
will remember this.

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:21.099
(laughter)

00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:24.506
MARISHA: Shut up, Telltale. Shut up.

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:30.986
MODERATOR: What's the most unexpected curveball
that the players have thrown you?

00:14:30.986 --> 00:14:33.108
MATT: Cows was pretty crazy--

00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:37.240
MODERATOR: Someone has to fill me in on the cows
thing.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.291
MATT: Long story short, they were briefly given a
task to help this farming community outside of the

00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:48.705
main city who had been losing livestock. They had
just gone missing, and there had been rumors of

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:53.290
some large creature snatching them away in the
middle of the night. The party decides to go and

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:59.564
infiltrate this cattle field by masquerading as
cows through illusion magic, and then try

00:14:59.564 --> 00:15:01.644
and interrogate the cows for information.

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:03.317
(laughter)

00:15:03.317 --> 00:15:07.126
MATT: Cows, even if you can speak to them through
magic means, aren't the best conversationalists

00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:12.611
nor really take in the information around them.
She talks to one of the cows and was like "So,

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.521
what have you seen?" and the cow is like--

00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:17.346
MARISHA and MATT: "Grass."

00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:18.735
MARISHA: "Big bird."

00:15:18.735 --> 00:15:24.922
MATT: "Pooping." Not a lot going on inside the
cow's head. Then suddenly this giant bird, a roc,

00:15:24.922 --> 00:15:30.449
comes swooping in and snatches one of the players
up, thinking it's one of the cows, and takes off

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:35.878
into the night. The rest of them, to give chase,
have to use a fly spell. Now all of a sudden you

00:15:35.878 --> 00:15:42.097
have this giant squadron of flying cows coasting
over the night sky after this giant bird, and thus

00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:49.482
the fan art rolled in after the evening, of this
wonderful moment. That was definitely a strange

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:52.563
curveball.

00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:57.994
MARISHA: I think the hashtag Vox Moochina started
happening after that.

00:15:57.994 --> 00:16:04.796
MATT: Yeah, there was a whole sequence where they
went to the Temple of the Raven Queen to retrieve

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:09.612
this artifact and the artifact in the end was
trapped. After this big battle with the beholder,

00:16:09.612 --> 00:16:13.965
everyone was like "Oh, thank god that was cool,
let's go see what loot there is." No one

00:16:13.965 --> 00:16:19.204
checked for traps. Taliesin, scared for Percy,
grabs it. Sets it off. Avoids it himself but it

00:16:19.204 --> 00:16:25.974
hits Laura's character. She fails her saving throw
and it kills her, outright. She's just dead, and

00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:30.857
so they end up trying to resurrect her and they go
through the ritual and as part of the ritual,

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:36.802
Liam's character, who is her twin brother,
basically prays to the Raven Queen in an angry way

00:16:36.802 --> 00:16:44.092
saying "Take me instead of her," and, unknowing,
started this path of joining in a pact with the

00:16:44.092 --> 00:16:49.810
Raven Queen. None of that was planned! None of
this was expected-- and now suddenly this entire

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.372
character's story is completely changed based on
this one improvised character moment, and it's

00:16:54.372 --> 00:16:57.522
pretty much defined his story.

00:16:57.522 --> 00:16:59.827
MARISHA: Based on this one fuck up.

00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:03.088
MATT: Yeah, this one bad roll that Laura made
completely altered the trajectory of this

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:04.452
character's story.

00:17:04.452 --> 00:17:07.164
MARISHA: I remember we were all so angry at
ourselves after that because we were like "Man,

00:17:07.164 --> 00:17:14.827
that was some level one mistakes right there--
can't believe we did that," and everyone wonders

00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:18.643
why we're so paranoid. (high pitched voice) "God,
why are you guys taking so long to talk about

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:25.174
these plans?" (crying voice) "Because people die!
This is real life!" Go with it.

00:17:29.404 --> 00:17:33.470
MODERATOR: Now that I think we're getting pretty
deep into the fandom I think I can ask this

00:17:33.515 --> 00:17:40.191
question. This is one of the many, many questions
submitted on Twitter, and this one is: If Gilmore

00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:46.482
owned a business, present day, what would it be?
And would it be a dance club?

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:52.094
(laughter)

00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:55.621
MATT: I think one of his many business in
modern-day would probably be a delightful dance

00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:58.361
club, that-- hell, I'd frequent that dance club.

00:17:58.361 --> 00:18:00.442
MARISHA: I'd go there, hell yeah.

00:18:00.442 --> 00:18:04.042
MATT: Gilmore's Glorious Dance Floor? Yeah.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:08.101
MARISHA: Gilmore's Glorious Grooves.

00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:12.441
MATT: There it is. (dance music noises) Oh yeah.

00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:15.204
MARISHA: (dance music noises)

00:18:15.204 --> 00:18:17.173
MATT: (Gilmore voice) That's right shake that
money maker.

00:18:17.173 --> 00:18:19.526
MARISHA: (dance music noises)

00:18:19.526 --> 00:18:25.722
MATT: Yeah, other than that, he would probably buy
out the Men's Warehouse and make it so much more

00:18:25.722 --> 00:18:30.340
fabulous. (Gilmore voice) Think business suits,
everything would be rhinestones and glitter, it

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.812
would be marvelous.

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:34.813
MARISHA: You're going to like the way you look, I
guarantee it.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.402
MATT: (Gilmore voice) I'm going to like the way
you look--

00:18:36.402 --> 00:18:37.525
(laughter)

00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:40.655
MATT: (Gilmore voice) Everyone's going to like the
way you look. Trust me, I know what I'm talking

00:18:40.655 --> 00:18:42.872
about.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:50.422
MODERATOR: Okay, so now that we've all experienced
that. Bringing it back a little bit, tell us more

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:57.413
about your background in tabletop gaming. Where
did it all start for you and what encouraged this

00:18:57.413 --> 00:18:59.962
love of gaming?

00:18:59.962 --> 00:19:06.761
MARISHA: I briefly mentioned it before but he was
my first DM and then-- that was just a one-shot,

00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:13.893
and then I was hooked from there on out. I think I
had an adrenaline high for like the rest of the

00:19:13.893 --> 00:19:20.533
evening after that game, and then from there on
out I sought out my own games and then I ended up

00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:28.123
doing a Buffy the Vampire tabletop RPG for a
while, which was great. A few other shorter

00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:37.164
campaigns, little one shots, and then came back
around for the game before this one. Which was

00:19:37.164 --> 00:19:38.865
with you and yeah--

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:39.846
MATT: Taliesin.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:45.941
MARISHA: Taliesin, and a few other people. That
was our long running game for about a year, well--

00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:47.508
MARISHA and MATT: For two years.

00:19:47.508 --> 00:19:55.600
MARISHA: Then from there, jumped into this game.
That's a deeper question for you.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:05.231
MATT: I started way back, before there was time
and deserts. In the ancient dark days of 1997.

00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:07.090
MARISHA: (sharp inhale)

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.831
[no audio]

00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:10.441
MARISHA: (sharp inhale)

00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.961
(laughing)

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.112
MARISHA: That's it.

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:21.361
MATT: Okay, I was waiting for more. Yeah, so I was
in high school, I was invited to be part of a

00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:27.880
game. I was excited. I made a terrible
sword-wielding wizard we talked about. We played

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.741
for a few months and I realized very quickly that
the dungeon master that was running the game was

00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:36.531
really frustrating and was playing more for his
own personal empowerment and power trip type

00:20:36.531 --> 00:20:40.875
circumstance than trying to tell a good story and
a narrative, and so I got frustrated and stopped

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:47.331
playing that game and started dungeon mastering my
own. That was where my real path of game running

00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:51.291
started. I've played in many games since, and with
many good friends I still talk to and occasionally

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:55.232
game with to this day, but that was
definitely where it all started.

00:20:55.232 --> 00:21:00.501
MODERATOR: That's awesome. A good D&D group is
hard to get right. As you mentioned, certain DMs

00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:04.720
can be super controlling and some people just
aren't great in a team.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.499
MATT: I think a lot of that also stems from
communication before you start playing too.

00:21:08.499 --> 00:21:12.940
Sometimes if the people aren't clear about what
kind of game it's going to be when you get into

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.212
it, you start discovering until it's too late,
that everyone had different ideas and expectations

00:21:18.212 --> 00:21:24.536
of it-- but I think that can be avoided for the
most part if that communication actually happens,

00:21:24.536 --> 00:21:27.239
but it still happens, it's hard to avoid.

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:31.461
MODERATOR: My question was going to be: do you
have any advice for anyone who might be starting

00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:36.451
their first game?

00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:43.429
MATT: If you're starting your first game where you
haven't played before, it's okay to be nervous,

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:52.685
I still am before every game we play, regardless.
You learn over time to go ahead and let go and get

00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:57.763
into the story and have fun. It doesn't mean you
have to do crazy voices like we do, or insane

00:21:57.763 --> 00:22:03.698
people, that's what we do for a living. You find
your comfort zone, and if someone is new to your

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:08.367
game and they're being a little shy, let them be.
Give them opportunities, and try to elevate them,

00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:12.057
and give them the spotlight occasionally. If you
have that one player in your game that usually

00:22:12.057 --> 00:22:17.179
takes the spotlight and stands up and overshadows
the rest, perhaps talk to them and let them calm

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:22.491
down a little bit and let somebody else step in
and be in that light as well. If you're just

00:22:22.491 --> 00:22:28.167
starting, definitely take the time to build a
character personality that you would be

00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:32.254
comfortable playing for an extended period of
time. It could be something that's opposite from

00:22:32.254 --> 00:22:36.461
you, if you're a meek person, you can try pick
someone who is more strong and bombastic in the

00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:41.318
hopes that maybe that will help pull you out of
that shell a little bit. Conversely, you can pick

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:45.188
someone who is comfortable first as well, just
make sure that when you have a character that

00:22:45.188 --> 00:22:49.152
you've developed, you have a clear enough idea of
how to play it so that when the opportunity

00:22:49.152 --> 00:22:55.724
arises, you don't feel, for lack of a better
term--

00:22:55.724 --> 00:22:57.772
MARISHA: Trapped?

00:22:57.772 --> 00:23:04.742
MATT: Maybe. You lack the drive and the will to
step out and make those character moments happen.

00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:08.445
A lot of D&D is give and take in an improv
environment with the other players, and if you

00:23:08.445 --> 00:23:12.702
have a lot of experienced people around you, it's
hard to find a place to jump in. Other people are

00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:18.857
used to seizing the moment and if you wait too
long you'll miss that opportunity. That comes with

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:25.062
experience. Don't be afraid to leap out, and take
a moment to say something, to shake the story up,

00:23:25.062 --> 00:23:30.455
and show the rest of the party that you have
something to offer beyond just additional damage

00:23:30.455 --> 00:23:33.209
in the occasional combat circumstance.

00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:40.234
MARISHA: I think to go off of that point, know
that the game won't wait for you, so if you want

00:23:40.234 --> 00:23:49.192
to say something, you have to make it be known. I
mean, there's been a few times-- I'm sure you guys

00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:55.450
have all noticed most of them, when something
might happen and one of us will have an idea, or

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.183
want to try to say something and then a moment
will come in and take it off in another direction

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:05.221
and then it's gone, but you have to let it go.
Once again. it's just like life, that happens

00:24:05.221 --> 00:24:16.681
sometimes, but if you want to say something, you
jump on it immediately. I actually get asked a lot

00:24:16.681 --> 00:24:24.547
from my fellow ladies, any advice for women who
want to jump into the genre, and a lot of them are

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:32.072
very intimidated because it seems very
male-dominated. That's such a tough, layered

00:24:32.072 --> 00:24:39.709
question to answer in so many ways-- I mean, in
two ways. One, we look out in this audience, like

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:49.215
half of them are women. First off, represent.
Yeah! Ladies game, hell yeah. I feel like that's

00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:51.476
slowly coming out of that trend.

00:24:51.476 --> 00:24:58.201
Secondly, I then want to address all of
our boys out there, all of our men, because there

00:24:58.201 --> 00:25:07.768
is a little bit of onus on you to realize that it
can be intimidating if you're a woman trying to

00:25:07.768 --> 00:25:17.195
come into this. So, if you are at a gaming store,
and a woman joins your group, just be welcoming.

00:25:17.195 --> 00:25:24.737
Realize that that's not necessarily easy to do and
it does take a lot of balls to walk in there, and

00:25:24.737 --> 00:25:30.702
just be open and accepting. I think so much about
D&D is about being open and accepting, because you

00:25:30.702 --> 00:25:34.439
don't want to sit down at a table where you feel
like you're going to be judged. You know?

00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:39.247
MATT: On that point, and this is my last other
note point to make on this. If you do feel there's

00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:42.456
conflict, there's something in the game that's
bothering you as a player, if you play for a few

00:25:42.456 --> 00:25:47.666
games and it's not clicking or a player is acting
in a way that you feel is preventing you from

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:52.725
really enjoying the experience, don't be afraid to
talk to them about it after the game. I wouldn't

00:25:52.725 --> 00:25:56.192
say throw down in the middle of the roleplaying
game session because it just tends to lead to

00:25:56.192 --> 00:26:01.083
heightened emotions and conflict, but talk to the
dungeon master afterward or talk to that player or

00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:06.125
both and just be like, "Hey, just wanted to ask,
the way this is going I'm not really feeling like

00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:11.710
it's letting me play my character or the story is
really hindering me from enjoying this, is there a

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:18.235
way that we can work towards changing or making it
better for all of us together?" And most people

00:26:18.235 --> 00:26:23.248
will be happy to, they just weren't aware that
there was a conflict of that type of circumstance.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:29.968
And if they aren't willing to, maybe find another
gaming group. Yeah, those are my biggest

00:26:29.968 --> 00:26:31.475
suggestions.

00:26:31.475 --> 00:26:37.328
MODERATOR: Super helpful. So, I know that you're
all bursting to ask your questions. Wonder Woman

00:26:37.328 --> 00:26:43.190
is our roving mic tonight which is just a really
fun thing to say, so put your hand up if you do

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.193
have a question, and Wonder Woman might choose
you.

00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:48.868
MATT: Come on, Wonder Woman.

00:26:48.868 --> 00:26:50.304
MARISHA: I choo- choo- choose you!

00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:52.175
MATT: Pick the person. I'm going to get my water.

00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:56.453
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Australian accent) Some great
NPC character voices. Any chance of an Australian

00:26:56.453 --> 00:26:57.283
one?

00:26:57.283 --> 00:26:59.732
(laughter)

00:26:59.732 --> 00:27:02.464
MATT: When I get comfortable enough with the
dialect to not embarrass myself in front of all of

00:27:02.464 --> 00:27:03.475
you, yes.

00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:05.724
(laughter)

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:10.188
MATT: As a performer I'm always working on
different dialects and accents and the Australian

00:27:10.188 --> 00:27:14.636
is one that I've, only in recent years, been
really trying to take a crack at and I'm not quite

00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:19.148
comfortable enough yet to go all in with a
character in that regard.

00:27:19.148 --> 00:27:22.152
MARISHA: We try not to be offensive.

00:27:22.152 --> 00:27:23.124
(laughter)

00:27:23.124 --> 00:27:25.496
MARISHA: Try. Emphasis on try.

00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:28.220
MATT: And if I do it and it sounds awful it's only
because it's a fantasy world where there aren't

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:35.369
actually Australians. It's its own unique dialect
that might loosely at times sound Australian, but

00:27:35.369 --> 00:27:37.089
it's my world whatever.

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:41.133
(laughter)

00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:43.804
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another one over here.

00:27:43.804 --> 00:27:49.391
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi Matt, I've got a question
about foreshadowing, storybooks and villain

00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:54.721
progression. So, I want to know, without giving
too much spoilers away, and I won't mind if you

00:27:54.721 --> 00:28:00.981
choose not to answer this, but back in the
pre-stream, when the group fought Brimscythe, was

00:28:00.981 --> 00:28:07.637
there anything they would have encountered that
would have stopped Thordak from returning?

00:28:07.637 --> 00:28:10.387
(laughter)

00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:15.854
MATT: I mean, there were things that were
happening during that time period parallel to

00:28:15.854 --> 00:28:19.928
their progression in the story that they could
have totally mucked up what eventually became the

00:28:19.928 --> 00:28:26.030
releasing of Thordak, but that would have been a
very very far arc, out of the path they were

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:33.227
taking. And they didn't have the necessary magical
ability at the time, nor the really clear know-how

00:28:33.227 --> 00:28:39.540
or knowledge to know to pursue that thread. As far
as they knew, Brimscythe was a singular entity and

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.451
what brief hint they had of the rest of the Chroma
Conclave with the other obsidian spheres in his

00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:52.460
lair, it was more like a "Oh, that's not good.
Let's not go there ever again. Slowly step out and

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.725
let's say that never happened."

00:28:54.725 --> 00:29:01.740
MARISHA: Yeah, basically there were evil eyeballs
in a bunch of crystal orbs, and they were like,

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.417
"We saw what you just did and we're coming for
you!" and were like "Well, that's ominous. Well,

00:29:07.417 --> 00:29:13.451
anyway, moving on! We have no context for that!"
and kind of just kept going.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:15.189
(laughter)

00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:19.614
MARISHA: I think we all had that moment when we
were like "This is going to come back to haunt us.

00:29:19.614 --> 00:29:25.441
"Moving on, time for the Winter's Crest Festival
you guys, high five, yeah!"

00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:30.702
MATT: They had more pressing matters at the time. 
So, it may have been possible, but it would have been

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:37.637
a very very extraneous long shot to discover all
the story elements, and even so, the entities that

00:29:37.637 --> 00:29:44.225
were involved would have probably sneezed and
killed them all, like Raishan who was partially

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:47.038
responsible for that, would have just turned and
gone "(laughs) That's adorable

00:29:47.038 --> 00:29:50.161
"(acid breath sound)," and they're all dead.

00:29:50.161 --> 00:29:53.332
MARISHA: That bitch is mine. That bitch is mine!
That bitch is mine!

00:29:53.332 --> 00:29:55.478
Raishan!

00:29:55.478 --> 00:29:57.693
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another question over
here.

00:29:57.693 --> 00:30:03.455
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey guys, huge fan, I watch all
of your videos all the time and one of the videos

00:30:03.455 --> 00:30:07.216
that I watched was with Vin Diesel, with the large
Witcher.

00:30:07.216 --> 00:30:09.277
MARISHA: What? Who's that? (fake laugh)

00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:15.474
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just want to ask you a
question, as a DM and a player myself. Was it

00:30:15.474 --> 00:30:23.539
awkward or was it funny moments when you're trying
to DM for Vin Diesel, yourself?

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:29.923
MATT: Well, first off that was one of the weirdest
phone calls I've ever gotten in my life. Dan Casey

00:30:30.229 --> 00:30:36.260
from Nerdist, three days before it happened, going
"Hey Matt, so? You want to come on Monday and

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.702
"dungeon master for Vin Diesel?" I was like "Haha,
what?"

00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:42.899
(laughter)

00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:47.179
MATT: Life's weird enough in L.A. that with
conversations like that there is always the chance

00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:51.866
of truth, even if someone's messing with you. I
was like "Erm, what? What do you mean? Yeah

00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:55.606
"totally, all right cool, so how long are we going
to play?" He's like "How about two hours of game

00:30:55.606 --> 00:30:58.927
"play time?" I'm like, "I'll prepare about two
hours of story, it'll be great." They build the

00:30:58.927 --> 00:31:04.920
whole set over the weekend. I show up Monday. I
get a call the morning up Dan Casey's like "Hey,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:10.284
"so Vin Diesel's time is cut a little short so we
can only play for an hour." I'm like "Okay." So I

00:31:10.284 --> 00:31:15.602
had to condense two hours of story that I had into
an hour. "We can do this, we can do this."

00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:20.215
MARISHA: And then they were like "Oh yeah, by the
way, we actually want to do a PR Q&A with Vin

00:31:20.543 --> 00:31:24.807
"Diesel for like, the last 20 minutes. So you
really only have about 40 minutes?"

00:31:24.807 --> 00:31:28.084
MATT and MARISHA: Which they then cut down to 25.

00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:33.894
MATT: So I had to condense two hours of story to
25 minutes, no pressure. But at the same time when

00:31:33.894 --> 00:31:38.755
you have someone on that level of multi
international stardom like Vin Diesel, it feels

00:31:38.755 --> 00:31:44.641
like an 80 to 90 percent chance they're going to
be a complete asshole. It's just how it works

00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:50.676
sometimes. So I was really worried. I was really
worried. And he showed up, and we finally got a

00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:54.712
chance to talk, and we went over the story and his
character for about ten, 15 minutes. And he was

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.888
the coolest, chillest dude ever.

00:31:57.888 --> 00:31:59.383
MARISHA: He was so nervous.

00:31:59.383 --> 00:32:02.865
MATT: He was like "I'm so excited, I haven't
played in a while and I hope I do okay. I like the

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:06.496
"idea of the character. Okay cool, we can do that.
Oh man I'm really excited, thanks for having me

00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:12.723
"on." He was a very very cool guy. I was super
excited. He was a little rusty at first and as you

00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:17.128
watch the video you see him, he kind of has to get
into it. It takes him a few minutes. But as soon

00:32:17.128 --> 00:32:22.284
as he rolls that first natural 20 he turns into a
big eight year old and he's like "Yeah! Critical!"

00:32:22.284 --> 00:32:25.496
That was when I knew we had him. I was like, "We
got this."

00:32:27.396 --> 00:32:28.018
MARISHA: Jesus.

00:32:28.018 --> 00:32:29.731
MATT: You were just talking into your wine,
weren't you!

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.830
(laughter)

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.953
MARISHA: Shut up! I wasn't, no I wasn't, no i
wasn't!

00:32:31.953 --> 00:32:32.905
MATT: You were talking into your wine!

00:32:32.905 --> 00:32:34.481
MARISHA: No, that wouldn't happen in front of a
bunch of people!

00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:37.372
MATT: So Marisha, what was the next question?

00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:38.606
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:40.808
(laughter)

00:32:40.808 --> 00:32:41.601
MATT: Here, talk into the mic.

00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:42.872
(laughter)

00:32:42.872 --> 00:32:45.598
MATT: I'm so glad we were all here to witness
that.

00:32:45.598 --> 00:32:52.147
(cheering)

00:32:52.147 --> 00:32:52.651
MATT: Yes!

00:32:52.651 --> 00:32:59.087
MARISHA: That was the most L.A. thing I've ever
done. I don't know what I was going to say. It's

00:32:59.087 --> 00:33:00.449
not important anymore.

00:33:00.449 --> 00:33:03.276
WONDER WOMAN: Would you like me to move on to the
next question?

00:33:03.276 --> 00:33:07.186
MATT: Yeah, yeah, to answer your question, it was
intimidating, but ultimately a lot of fun.

00:33:07.186 --> 00:33:09.912
WONDER WOMAN: We've just got another question
here, so--

00:33:09.912 --> 00:33:15.998
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi guys, this kind of ties in to
the whole making a character that you're

00:33:15.998 --> 00:33:20.135
comfortable with. How much of your personality
goes into making your characters, and for you

00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:23.798
Matt, how much of your personality drives the
stories you create?

00:33:23.798 --> 00:33:29.525
MATT: It's hard not to put an element of your
personality in every character you play, because

00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:34.659
they're your character. Each represents a facet of
your personality, some that maybe don't get

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:39.494
explored as often, or that you don't have the
opportunity to. Even in evil campaigns, you can

00:33:39.494 --> 00:33:44.199
make a terrible character, but is a part of your
id that's in that character, you want to play the

00:33:44.199 --> 00:33:50.331
story because you don't have the opportunity to
express these darker elements of your persona, so

00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:55.327
this is your chance to do so. So it's hard not to
put yourself into a character to a certain

00:33:55.327 --> 00:33:55.766
extent.

00:33:55.766 --> 00:34:01.281
MARISHA: I mean, technically, if we want to get
all actor-y woo-woo on you for a hot second, the

00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:08.466
Stanislavski method actually works a little bit
like this, where you make a table, or a T chart,

00:34:08.466 --> 00:34:15.719
and whenever you have a character, you write down
the ways you are like that character and all the

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:22.219
ways you are not alike that character, and the way
Stanislavski teaches it is; in the ways that you

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:30.652
are similar, awesome! You don't have to act. And
it's not a bad system because I could be a mile

00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:36.138
apart from someone sitting next to me, but you're
still going to have something in common. Everyone

00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:38.492
has something in common, somewhere.

00:34:38.492 --> 00:34:45.886
MATT: As far as creating stories and world and
NPCs, in the same way, it's hard not to put a

00:34:45.886 --> 00:34:52.318
little bit of yourself into them. Story is a
little more esoteric. I'm fascinated by things

00:34:52.318 --> 00:34:58.468
that are not like me, things that are different.
Especially as a dungeon master where you play so

00:34:58.468 --> 00:35:03.489
many characters, part of the fun of that, the
thrill of that, is being able to express so many

00:35:03.489 --> 00:35:07.494
different things that are outside of your comfort
zone.

00:35:07.494 --> 00:35:12.381
MATT: I really enjoy being able to step in and
play female characters across the spectrum. From

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:19.691
very powerful, strong personalities, to sly, dark,
somewhat manipulative individuals. As far as dudes

00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:28.394
go, I get to play a range of dumb, grizzled,
outback farmers, to very intense politicians, to

00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:32.606
all these different things that are not at all
like me, except for little bits here and there.

00:35:32.606 --> 00:35:39.012
You find that seed of truth is what you build on
each time. But for making characters, it's hard

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:41.179
not to put a nugget of yourself in there, really.

00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:43.209
WONDER WOMAN: Got another question over here.

00:35:43.209 --> 00:35:49.683
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So, you've got a backstory you
said you've written for both Gilmore and Allura.

00:35:49.683 --> 00:35:54.971
God forbid anything happens to them because we
love them, but would you post online their

00:35:54.971 --> 00:35:56.600
backstories for us to read?

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:03.902
MATT: Perhaps one day. It's one of those things
where, when you're developing a world of this

00:36:03.902 --> 00:36:11.677
size, and it's a lot to develop, a lot of
expectation, a lot of eyes on it, I have to find a

00:36:11.677 --> 00:36:15.627
fine line between revealing information that's
already been revealed, and things that are still

00:36:15.627 --> 00:36:19.811
behind closed doors. There are things that may,
and probably shouldn't be revealed, because the

00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:23.642
party won't know. And if I've learned anything
it's that information online, everyone is going to

00:36:23.642 --> 00:36:27.772
tweet it at my players. I can be like "This is a
thing that's happening, but don't tell the

00:36:27.772 --> 00:36:32.702
players." And then 12 hours later it's like "Hey
Liam, look at this thing!" And of course players

00:36:32.702 --> 00:36:37.086
are going to look, so I purposely keep a lot of
things close to my chest because I want it to be a

00:36:37.086 --> 00:36:39.394
surprise for the players and for the watchers.

00:36:39.394 --> 00:36:44.222
MARISHA: Yeah, by the by, if you tag us in the
tweet it does mean we can see it.

00:36:44.222 --> 00:36:46.543
(laughter)

00:36:46.543 --> 00:36:49.332
MARISHA: Not a lot of people understand that
concept.

00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:57.555
MATT: "Oh my god, I hate that episode, I hate
watching @Marisha_Ray's face." Like, she sees that tweet.

00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:05.800
MARISHA: And I'm like, "Hey dude." And he's like
"I didn't know! I didn't know you-- Hi? Hi." I can

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.370
see that.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:11.311
MATT: "Big fan, I love Keyleth, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean that!" Dude, it's cool, just don't put

00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:12.102
me in the tweet.

00:37:12.102 --> 00:37:14.494
(laughter)

00:37:14.494 --> 00:37:19.080
MATT: But yeah, I think eventually, when this arc
finishes and things are revealed, I probably do,

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:25.189
and I've talked about this a little bit, when Vox
Machina's story ends (sad noise), do a big Q&A

00:37:25.189 --> 00:37:29.771
with all the things that people didn't know and
the questions that I can't answer now because that

00:37:29.771 --> 00:37:32.082
part's over, I'll be happy to discuss.

00:37:32.082 --> 00:37:38.374
MARISHA: We've been planning as a group that
whenever Vox Machina's story comes to the end we

00:37:38.374 --> 00:37:45.081
want to have like, at a tavern, some drinks, and
it's us talking to St. Peter at the Pearly Gates

00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:51.349
being like "All right dude, so tell us this one
time that the beholder did this thing and could I

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:53.641
"have avoided it?" and you just tell us all your
secrets.

00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:55.299
MATT: I can't tell you all the secrets.

00:37:55.299 --> 00:37:56.780
MARISHA: I want all the secrets!

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.532
MATT: I can't tell you all the secrets.

00:37:58.532 --> 00:37:59.105
MARISHA: All!

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:00.402
MATT: Can't. Can't tell you all the secrets.

00:38:00.402 --> 00:38:00.841
MARISHA: Yes!

00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:02.102
MATT: Not happening.

00:38:02.102 --> 00:38:03.142
MARISHA: Okay, moving on.

00:38:03.142 --> 00:38:04.076
(laughter)

00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:06.003
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another question over
here.

00:38:06.003 --> 00:38:10.083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: In any game, past or present, do
you have a favorite trick or cursed item?

00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:12.063
MARISHA: I'm sorry what?

00:38:12.063 --> 00:38:14.681
WONDER WOMAN: A favorite trick or cursed item.

00:38:14.681 --> 00:38:18.423
MATT: I mean, Craven Edge was a fun one.

00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:20.305
(laughter)

00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:24.732
MATT: Not necessarily cursed, but sentient weapons
and sentient magical items are always an

00:38:24.732 --> 00:38:30.442
interesting dynamic. Bringing another personality
and source of strong power in a game that also can

00:38:30.442 --> 00:38:34.663
decide whether or not it likes its wielder, or can
manipulate the wielder, always makes for a fun

00:38:34.663 --> 00:38:44.553
game. That's a lot of fun. Less of a magical item,
but I like characters that can play with luck. It

00:38:44.553 --> 00:38:54.134
happened in our game, these hags, dark fey
creatures, could pluck elements of luck and fate

00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:58.852
from players as part of a trade, and I like that
aspect of it. While it's not necessarily an item,

00:38:58.852 --> 00:39:05.801
that character now looms. Technically, now Vax is
now indentured to one of those hags. The trade

00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:13.000
that he made for the poison that he has yet to
use. Oh, I remember everything guys. I remember

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.464
everything.

00:39:13.464 --> 00:39:14.193
MARISHA: He hasn't used that poison?

00:39:14.193 --> 00:39:15.004
MATT: Nope.

00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:16.223
MARISHA: What a dumbass.

00:39:16.223 --> 00:39:18.382
(laughter)

00:39:18.382 --> 00:39:20.924
MARISHA: He's going to die over that poison and
he's not going to even use it.

00:39:20.924 --> 00:39:22.402
MATT: Not my problem.

00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:24.732
MARISHA: Love you Liam, if you watch this later.

00:39:24.732 --> 00:39:28.032
(laughter)

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.853
WONDER WOMAN: So we've got another question over
here.

00:39:29.853 --> 00:39:36.663
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's up guys. So, we've had a whole
year of this happening so we've got great fan art,

00:39:36.663 --> 00:39:43.616
great fanfiction and stuff. So that we know, if
this is being recorded, what's the line of you

00:39:43.616 --> 00:39:47.812
going "Hey this is great-- whoa, back up, I don't
want that!"

00:39:47.812 --> 00:39:50.727
MARISHA: Anything on rule 34?

00:39:50.727 --> 00:39:53.470
(laughter)

00:39:53.470 --> 00:40:03.276
MATT: I will say, I'm very open to all sorts of
fanfiction, fan art, even racy stuff. We go to

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:09.638
Burning Man, we're cool, whatever floats your
boat, it's fine. But when you stumble upon

00:40:09.638 --> 00:40:17.262
extremely graphic sexual fan fiction about the
players, not the characters? I'll draw the line there.

00:40:17.262 --> 00:40:19.438
MARISHA: I forgot about that, yeah.

00:40:19.438 --> 00:40:24.780
MATT: And you know what? Power to you, I guess,
but that, at least, that was a very awkward

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.242
morning. I think Taliesin read longer than
anybody, and he was like, "Oh, god, oh god, I

00:40:31.242 --> 00:40:33.058
can't stop, why, no, oh!"

00:40:33.058 --> 00:40:41.121
MARISHA: It became like a test of willpower, to
see how long you could get through it. I did what

00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:46.589
with-- how many of us were in one-- what?! Jesus!

00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:48.330
MATT: That was unique.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.780
MARISHA: Yeah, that was extreme.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.539
MATT: And yet, at the same time, I guess,
achievement unlocked? I don't know. The saddest

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:55.213
little boop boop.

00:40:55.213 --> 00:40:59.668
MODERATOR: Now everybody is going to try and find it now.

00:40:59.668 --> 00:41:04.810
MATT: We may have just horribly embarrassed some
poor Tumblr writer, I'm so sorry if we did.

00:41:05.221 --> 00:41:06.341
MARISHA: We love you, just--

00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.934
MATT: You're great, we love you and appreciate
you, it just caught us off guard.

00:41:08.934 --> 00:41:09.621
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:41:09.621 --> 00:41:11.303
MATT: Wasn't expecting that.

00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:14.451
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another question, if you'd
like.

00:41:14.451 --> 00:41:15.221
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:41:15.221 --> 00:41:16.890
(laughter)

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.481
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matthew Merther-- Merth? uh.

00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.032
MATT: Yes?

00:41:20.032 --> 00:41:21.092
MARISHA: (garbled noises)

00:41:21.092 --> 00:41:25.083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matthew Mercer, I'm sure this has
never happened to you, you're such a great DM, but

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:28.363
let's say you wake up one day, 20 minutes to
game--

00:41:28.622 --> 00:41:29.864
MARISHA: Where are you going with this?

00:41:29.864 --> 00:41:31.252
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There is a point.

00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:34.034
MARISHA: I'm sorry, this has never happened to me,
I'm so embarrassed. Keep going.

00:41:34.034 --> 00:41:38.583
AUDIENCE MEMBER: 20 minutes to the game, you've
got nothing prepared. What do you do?

00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:40.843
MATT: 20 minutes to the game and nothing
prepared?

00:41:40.843 --> 00:41:41.963
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Nothing prepared.

00:41:41.963 --> 00:41:49.687
MATT: Write down a bunch of names, and just see
where it goes. One of the things that'll hold you

00:41:49.687 --> 00:41:56.091
up for any game, situation wise, is having to
create NPC names, in my opinion. And nothing will

00:41:56.091 --> 00:42:04.672
take the players out of a deep fantasy story, more
than being like, "Oh, you encounter? David. The

00:42:04.672 --> 00:42:13.153
"knight." Or, "Steve, the stable master." You know?
Steve's been in a lot of your guys' games, and mine

00:42:13.153 --> 00:42:19.694
too. Steve gets around the table. The rest of it
you can bullshit as much as you want, but having

00:42:19.694 --> 00:42:25.546
that list of names is so helpful, because can just
say, "Oh yeah, you run into a half-orc named--"

00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:26.093
MARISHA: Perv-an!

00:42:26.093 --> 00:42:32.724
MATT: Purvan, as a singular phrase.

00:42:32.724 --> 00:42:34.144
MARISHA: Perv-an!

00:42:34.144 --> 00:42:44.103
(laughter and cheers)

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:48.760
MATT: That's an actual name, and all the people
out there whose name is Purvan, who watch the

00:42:49.078 --> 00:42:53.518
show, hate all of you now. But I love you,
Purvan!

00:42:53.518 --> 00:42:59.178
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another question up here,
unless you want to continue?

00:42:59.178 --> 00:43:03.855
MATT: Just to finish up real fast, once you have
those names down, the rest of it you can bullshit

00:43:04.085 --> 00:43:09.649
all you want and make up whatever happens, but
that to me has always been what sells a story

00:43:09.649 --> 00:43:13.295
you're making up or not, is to have those names on
the go, for any NPCs they encounter like that.

00:43:13.295 --> 00:43:17.246
Monsters, you can make up stats on the go if you
want, you just see how the dice roll and say,

00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:22.055
"Yeah, that seems like that should hit." Or,
"Oops, that missed!" Or, "You find a crystal that

00:43:22.055 --> 00:43:27.487
"hums and whispers the phrase 'Golden Girls' over
and over again. What does that mean? Let's find

00:43:27.487 --> 00:43:30.734
"out!" You can make up whatever you want, but the
names make it easier.

00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:34.876
MARISHA: Monday, Tuesday, Happy Days-- whoa! Holy
shit, what is this stone?

00:43:34.876 --> 00:43:37.406
MATT: It's a great module, the Happy Days module,
highly recommend it.

00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:46.316
MARISHA: What was the book we found in the store,
Game Empire, and it was called GM's Gems or

00:43:46.316 --> 00:43:47.154
something like that.

00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:51.426
MATT: Yeah, it was a cool book called GM's Gems,
that has just a bunch of resources for game

00:43:51.426 --> 00:43:57.904
masters that has a bunch of tips and tricks on NPC
creation, world building, magical item

00:43:57.904 --> 00:44:01.160
development, and a bunch of examples you can pull
from that, as well.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:08.319
MARISHA: Yeah, it had a list of names, it had a
list of NPC quirky hooks, like has one eye and an

00:44:08.578 --> 00:44:13.368
eyepatch, and has a limp, you know, so that you
can just look quickly and be like, this is an

00:44:13.368 --> 00:44:15.709
interesting person, that I totally thought about!

00:44:15.709 --> 00:44:20.377
MATT: So if you have 20 minutes, you can go there
and be like, Uh, all right, they're in a small

00:44:20.377 --> 00:44:29.950
bog, and they discover that giant rats have become
sentient, and have begun stealing children in the

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:35.018
night to mutate them into horned rat gods.

00:44:35.018 --> 00:44:36.868
MARISHA: It's like Mad Libs D&D.

00:44:36.868 --> 00:44:41.345
WONDER WOMAN: So we've got another question over
here.

00:44:41.374 --> 00:44:41.859
MATT: Yes!

00:44:41.859 --> 00:44:47.064
AUDIENCE MEMBER: G'day, guys. One thing I've
noticed with Matt saying a lot of the Telltale

00:44:47.064 --> 00:44:53.825
things, like "Matt will remember this." What are
the chances of actually getting a Critical Role

00:44:53.825 --> 00:45:01.844
Telltale game? And if it was in the works, would
it be a pre-season one, a post-season one, or

00:45:01.844 --> 00:45:03.645
would it follow an NPC?

00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:12.304
MATT: I mean, I'd love that! That would be
awesome! I think, when their licenses involve

00:45:12.304 --> 00:45:22.266
Minecraft and Batman, our lowly D&D game isn't
quite going to call their attention-- yet. One can dream.

00:45:22.266 --> 00:45:30.434
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, we know a lot of the
Telltale guys too, but they--- Yeah, they're doing

00:45:30.434 --> 00:45:32.255
their own thing right now.

00:45:32.255 --> 00:45:37.405
MATT: Between Minecraft and Batman, and the
Borderlands, most of our party has worked with

00:45:37.712 --> 00:45:43.653
some Telltale to some degree, but it's also their
interest. If they came to us, and wanted to make

00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:48.252
one, hell yeah! Hell yeah! I'd be all over that!
So what I'm saying is, you all should bombard

00:45:48.252 --> 00:45:53.906
Telltale to make a Critical Role game, and just
let them know that there is interest. No, don't do that.

00:45:53.906 --> 00:45:54.875
MARISHA: Don't do that.

00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:57.705
MATT: Don't do that. That can come across as a
little?

00:45:57.705 --> 00:46:04.122
MARISHA: Let's just say there are things. Being
worked on.

00:46:04.122 --> 00:46:06.828
MATT: That's way too vague.

00:46:06.828 --> 00:46:10.988
MARISHA: I can't say any more! NDAs, and shit!

00:46:10.988 --> 00:46:15.487
MATT: We have no idea; we would love one day to
create something like that.

00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:18.256
MARISHA: We're working on it, man!

00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:22.264
MATT: We're trying to find ways to expand the
media.

00:46:22.264 --> 00:46:26.424
MARISHA: And I do want to preface all of this
with, when you guys watch Critical Role, we are

00:46:26.424 --> 00:46:33.134
pretty much 100% self-produced. We work with our
producers at Geek and Sundry, but they are also

00:46:33.134 --> 00:46:41.657
producing everything else, so we're very self-run,
so when you see the fan-art galleries, in break,

00:46:41.657 --> 00:46:49.887
Liam does that. When we do the pre-show
announcements, I do that. That's all stuff we

00:46:49.887 --> 00:46:58.893
wrangle. We self-produced our opening title video,
you know? So it's just us, and we're working as

00:46:58.893 --> 00:47:01.845
fast as we can. Yeah.

00:47:01.845 --> 00:47:04.675
MODERATOR: I think we've got time for one more
question.

00:47:04.675 --> 00:47:08.525
WONDER WOMAN: We've actually been given a few
moments more to ask some more questions.

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:10.917
MATT: You don't say. Lovely.

00:47:10.917 --> 00:47:15.295
WONDER WOMAN: You guys are special. We've got a
question here.

00:47:15.295 --> 00:47:16.305
MATT: Question, please!

00:47:16.305 --> 00:47:19.324
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was just wondering, if you
could do the Gollum voice?

00:47:19.324 --> 00:47:22.205
MARISHA: Something about the Gollum voice?

00:47:22.205 --> 00:47:24.734
WONDER WOMAN: Yeah, just wondering if you could do
the Gollum voice.

00:47:24.734 --> 00:47:25.906
MARISHA: Go, Matt, go.

00:47:25.906 --> 00:47:31.162
MATT: Well Liam can do it a lot better, because he
actually does Gollum for the games, but let me

00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:41.549
see. (Gollum voice) "It came to me. My own. My
love. My precious. Gollum! Gollum! We wants it.

00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:48.694
"Gives it to us, please! No, you're a thief, a
liar. No, no, not listening. Not listening!

00:47:48.694 --> 00:47:55.556
"Murderer! No, go away!" There you go!

00:47:55.556 --> 00:48:02.009
(cheers)

00:48:02.274 --> 00:48:03.277
WONDER WOMAN: So we've got a question over here.

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:07.238
MATT: Pff. I do not need your mic!

00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:10.828
(laughter)

00:48:10.828 --> 00:48:15.438
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was just wondering, in Vox
Machina, a lot of their characters are

00:48:15.438 --> 00:48:21.200
multiclassed for story purposes, but Keyleth is
one of the characters I don't see multiclassing.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.850
So if you could, what would you be, and why?

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:33.677
MARISHA: If I multiclassed into anything? So, full
disclosure, I actually debated heavily about

00:48:33.917 --> 00:48:42.047
multiclassing with Keyleth for a hot second, but I
am a little torn, because honestly I'm still kind of

00:48:42.047 --> 00:48:46.801
going with the flow of the character-- none of us
know what's going on, we're all riding by the seat

00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:53.706
of our pants with this one, so you guys know about
as much of Keyleth's future as I do. Because we're

00:48:53.706 --> 00:49:01.436
allowing ourselves to be affected by the story
elements, so it'd be stupid if I was like, "No, I

00:49:01.436 --> 00:49:06.227
"mean, this is going to be my future, I'm going to
have an Oscar in five years!" You know, like that

00:49:06.227 --> 00:49:15.949
type of thing. So we try not to do that, because
the world changes you. So, I did debate for a hot

00:49:15.949 --> 00:49:27.777
second when Keyleth was very angry, she's pulling
out of her anger phase, but when she was so upset

00:49:27.777 --> 00:49:33.105
at the way that the world had become, and that
she'd been lied to-- she felt like she'd been lied

00:49:33.105 --> 00:49:38.826
to. So there was a hot second that I actually
debated about throwing a point of barbarian into her.

00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:40.799
(whoas, surprise)

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:41.678
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:48.427
MATT: Man, Raging and Wild Shape is no joke. That
is no joke.

00:49:48.427 --> 00:49:56.653
MARISHA: So I thought about-- and I'll tell you
the moment that I thought about it, and it was

00:49:56.983 --> 00:50:01.753
after the Fire Ashari had gotten wiped out, and I
levelled shortly after the Fire Ashari got wiped out.

00:50:01.753 --> 00:50:07.403
And then there was the few times at
Whitestone where I started using my Fire Storm

00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:14.259
spell and I was describing it as very like,
Keyleth is enraged, she's enraged, and angry, and

00:50:14.259 --> 00:50:20.032
she's crying and she's casting these fire spells.
So that was the moment after the Fire Ashari was

00:50:20.032 --> 00:50:27.544
wiped out that I heavily debated it but-- it is
tough because Keyleth's whole overarching journey

00:50:27.544 --> 00:50:33.963
is to try and become arch-druid, and be the
salvation to her people so, yeah.

00:50:33.963 --> 00:50:37.728
WONDER WOMAN: We've got another quick voice
request over here.

00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:39.378
MARISHA: Dance, monkey. Dance!

00:50:39.378 --> 00:50:40.457
MATT: Dance, monkey!

00:50:40.457 --> 00:50:41.440
MARISHA: Dance, monkey!

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.736
AUDIENCE MEMBER: About your character McCree,
what's the time?

00:50:45.736 --> 00:50:49.307
(mic drop)

00:50:49.307 --> 00:50:58.736
(laughing)

[no audio]

00:51:07.738 --> 00:51:10.546
MARISHA: I'm just enjoying Overwatch like a happy
person.

00:51:10.546 --> 00:51:12.536
(laughing)

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.068
MARISHA: Pew, pew, pew, pew.

00:51:14.068 --> 00:51:14.945
(laughing)

00:51:14.945 --> 00:51:18.705
MATT: (western intro noise) (McCree voice) It's
high noon.

00:51:18.705 --> 00:51:23.347
MARISHA: (screaming)

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:25.437
(cheering)

00:51:25.437 --> 00:51:27.558
MATT: (McCree voice )Someone call the undertaker.

00:51:27.558 --> 00:51:30.985
WONDER WOMAN: Now we've got our final question.

00:51:30.985 --> 00:51:34.615
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Um, Hi!

00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:35.725
MATT: Hi!

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:38.334
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Some of my-- Marisha! Hey!

00:51:38.334 --> 00:51:39.761
MARISHA: Hi!

00:51:39.761 --> 00:51:44.417
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Some of my favorite moments in
Critical Role have been the character

00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:50.596
interactions, whether it's between the player
characters or between the NPCs. I think my

00:51:50.596 --> 00:51:56.995
favorite to date is Gilmore and Keyleth
teleporting to find a very naked Vax.

00:51:56.995 --> 00:51:59.792
(laughter)

00:51:59.792 --> 00:52:01.044
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And just that reaction--

00:52:01.044 --> 00:52:05.096
MATT: There's been a lot of player nudity in
recent games. It's been a theme recently, I'm

00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:06.534
like, okay! All right!

00:52:06.534 --> 00:52:07.703
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think everybody is okay with
this.

00:52:07.703 --> 00:52:11.463
MARISHA: Hey! Body pride, right. Be comfortable
with yourself!

00:52:11.463 --> 00:52:12.674
MATT: There's nothing wrong with it.

00:52:12.674 --> 00:52:13.769
MARISHA: No body shaming!

00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:15.596
MATT: No, I'm not shaming anything. I just--

00:52:15.596 --> 00:52:17.817
MARISHA: Free the nipple!

00:52:17.817 --> 00:52:19.906
(cheering)

00:52:19.906 --> 00:52:22.964
MATT: It's just a trend that started happening
more often recently. I was like, huh all righty.

00:52:22.964 --> 00:52:24.378
Anyway, your question.

00:52:24.378 --> 00:52:28.166
MARISHA: Dragons are destroying the world, you
think we give a shit about seeing each other's titties?

00:52:29.266 --> 00:52:35.997
MATT: No! Why are you yelling at me? I think it's
great! I was just acknowledging it! What's your question?

00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:42.734
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is, is that something
that-- that interaction between

00:52:42.936 --> 00:52:50.976
yourselves, between the player characters, between
the NPCs. Is that something you actively try to

00:52:50.976 --> 00:52:58.127
foster, or is that something that's just kind of
come about over the years as you've been playing?

00:52:58.127 --> 00:53:10.405
or is that something you kind of go, "Oh I really
want to go for these cute moments, go for these

00:53:10.405 --> 00:53:11.971
"sad, scary moments between all of you so it's not
just combat," or is that like, "Oh it's happened

00:53:11.971 --> 00:53:13.671
"this way, this is great?"

00:53:14.011 --> 00:53:17.659
MATT: I think it's not so much that everyone's
trying to shoot for sad moments, or happy moments,

00:53:17.659 --> 00:53:23.973
or levity-- we're all performers and we all love
story telling and narrative, primarily. That's our

00:53:23.973 --> 00:53:30.228
career, that's what drew us into it. So while all
players and myself enjoy the strategy and the

00:53:30.228 --> 00:53:34.362
difficulty of battle, that's a very big part of
the game for us at the same time it's as

00:53:34.362 --> 00:53:37.762
important, if not slightly more so, is the
narrative and the character interactions for us.

00:53:37.762 --> 00:53:45.004
Nobody really plans moments, per se, because no
one knows what's going to happen, even me. I can't

00:53:45.365 --> 00:53:49.513
tell you how many games I've prepared sheets and
then we only get that far into it, or we skip all

00:53:49.513 --> 00:53:53.472
this and go right to here. So I don't know what
they're going to do either, I think all these

00:53:53.472 --> 00:53:59.415
moments that you see are part of what makes the
show so interesting, for all you guys, and us, is

00:53:59.415 --> 00:54:02.923
no one knows what's going to happen, and all those
moments happen organically.

00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:08.423
MARISHA: Yeah, you're experiencing it with us.
Which I think, like you said, is why it's so

00:54:08.423 --> 00:54:14.913
engaging. When there is a huge plot line reveal,
we're reacting with you guys.

00:54:14.913 --> 00:54:21.970
MATT: Yeah, that kind of-- for us, the thrill is,
for me, knowing what's going to come, dropping it,

00:54:22.289 --> 00:54:25.886
and seeing how the players react and take it, and
in many cases, taking it in directions I don't

00:54:25.886 --> 00:54:32.200
expect and-- that's really cool for me too. So, I
don't think anyone plans specifically-- except for

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:38.877
maybe Sam, Sam plays the long con. I know he'll
plan moments to happen a ways away and find a way

00:54:38.877 --> 00:54:44.231
to drop it. So if anyone, he's the one that does
plot on his own for a bit, but other than that I

00:54:44.231 --> 00:54:48.633
think most everyone else is playing pretty much
reactionary to whatever is occurring in the game

00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:50.171
and that's kind of thrilling.

00:54:50.171 --> 00:54:54.361
MARISHA: Yeah, I think the only time that I've
really-- like the Gilmore thing, that was totally

00:54:54.361 --> 00:54:58.121
circumstantial, that just worked out the way it
worked out.

00:54:58.121 --> 00:55:05.911
MARISHA: The only times that I've tried to think
about moments and conversations I want to have,

00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:12.680
generally they're still a result of reaction,
they're still a result of "Well, this happened, so

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:17.752
"I know I want to have this conversation." So like,
in last-- not last episode but the episode before,

00:55:17.752 --> 00:55:24.740
talking with Pike. I knew that Keyleth wanted to
talk to Pike about the religion aspect before they

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:34.342
left, and then-- Keyleth and Kima had butted heads
early on and that was totally reactionary because

00:55:34.342 --> 00:55:42.019
Keyleth did not trust Kima. But after that,
Keyleth felt a little bad so there were apologies

00:55:42.019 --> 00:55:50.650
later. That was thought about, but not necessarily
much more beyond, "I know I want to apologize," or

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:54.729
"I know I want to talk to Pike," and that's kind
of as far as we go.

00:55:54.729 --> 00:55:57.781
MATT: Good question.

00:55:57.781 --> 00:56:04.009
WONDER WOMAN: Okay so, we don't have any more
questions left to ask them but do any of you guys

00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:06.151
like singing? By any chance?

00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.188
MODERATOR: Do you guys know that there's a reason
this weekend is special, other than Haven, and

00:56:09.188 --> 00:56:11.837
it's Matt's birthday this weekend.

WONDER WOMAN: So? I'm going to point this mic at
you guys.

00:56:21.217 --> 00:56:23.357
MODERATOR: None of us want to sing into the mic.

00:56:23.357 --> 00:56:29.758
WONDER WOMAN: None of you want us to sing into the
mic and we're going to do a very extra special

00:56:29.758 --> 00:56:38.438
Happy Birthday chorus. Now, we've also got a bit
of a special group of singers joining us tonight.

00:56:38.438 --> 00:56:43.569
You may recognize their voices, and if you peek
around the corner on to the video screens, if you

00:56:43.569 --> 00:56:48.787
can, you might be able to see them but let's get
started with Happy Birthday.
