[no audio]

2
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,892
--break into a coughing fit at the
top of the game. You all right, Liam?

3
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:57,771
LIAM: I said a bad word. I got the soap.

4
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:03,654
MATT: That's called karma. First and foremost,
we're going to get through our announcements for

5
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:08,347
the evening so we can hop into the game. First
off, tonight's awesome sponsor returning to us is

6
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,871
Backblaze.

7
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:18,673
SAM: Yeah, are we good, guys? Are we good? What's
going on over there? There's lots of people

8
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,439
pulling out their hair.

9
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,873
OFFSCREEN: I think we're having sound issues.

10
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:25,761
MATT: Okay. Hold on just a second.

11
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:29,491
SAM: A lot of people doing this. (panicked
sounds)

12
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,549
TRAVIS: Out of sync, is what they're saying.

13
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,233
OFFSCREEN: All right, Twitch has sound.

14
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,845
SAM: Twitch has sound? We're good to go?

15
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:40,231
MATT: All righty. So Sam.

16
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:47,146
SAM: Hi. You know, Backblaze is one of our top two
favorite sponsors.

17
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:50,223
(laughter)

18
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:55,530
SAM: We love them to death. They love us. They are
Critters. In fact, coming up later, you should

19
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,826
tune in to the break to see their newest ad. It's
made for Critters by a Critter. Backblaze is

20
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:03,724
unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just
five dollars a month. I actually use it. All my

21
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:11,028
shit's backed up. Tonight, I prepared a word game
for all of you to compete. You have to buzz in.

22
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:17,638
You have to give me the answer. I can give you two
clues, like two words, and you buzz in and tell me

23
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:22,549
what the words are. Here's a hint. Here's a clue:
all the answers are the same. Okay, so like, for

24
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:29,957
instance, if I were to say, the rear part of your
chest and what a fire does--

25
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,425
LAURA: Backblaze.

26
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:38,770
SAM: Backblaze, that's right. One point for Laura.
Okay. Here the game begins. The opposite color of

27
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,284
white, and the topmost part of a helicopter.

28
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:42,871
TRAVIS: Black blades!

29
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:47,476
(laughter)

30
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:53,022
SAM: Classical composer Johann Sebastian, and a
hairstyle made popular by Pippi Longstocking.

31
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,439
LAURA: Bach braids!

32
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:58,139
SAM: Laura Bailey. Two points.

33
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,238
MARISHA: Is there a buzzer system?

34
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:02,199
SAM: You just have to say it.

35
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:08,339
Pages of paper bound together and a climbing
or rappel technique.

36
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,382
TRAVIS: Binder rappel!

37
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:14,697
LAURA: Brad! No.

38
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:23,611
TRAVIS: Book rappel. Book belay. Book belay!
(laughs) I'm the smartest man alive!

39
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,727
SAM: Is it two-to-two right now?

40
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:29,045
LAURA: I thought pages binded together. I was
going to say brad.

41
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:37,335
SAM: Okay, this is not a real game. I invented
this on the drive over! Okay, one more. You know

42
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:44,666
what? You guys aren't playing anymore. This is
between Laura and Travis. You know what? I'm going

43
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:52,378
to do two more, just because I love them. Popular
Ben Folds Five song, and the abrasive sound a

44
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,409
donkey makes.

45
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,795
LIAM: Brick bray!

46
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:14,971
SAM: Brick bray, yes! One more. One more. To get
stoned and to get stoned. It's bake blaze. Anyway,

47
00:24:14,971 --> 00:24:20,751
Bakeblaze is an unlimited cloud backup for Macs
and PCs. It can backup fanart, fanfic, music,

48
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,551
photos, videos, drawings, documents, all of your
data. You can restore by mail. If you crash,

49
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:28,950
they'll send you a hard drive. It's amazing. Go to
backblaze.com/criticalrole.

50
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,342
(cheering)

51
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:44,197
MATT: Thank you, Bakeblaze, for your sponsorship.
All right. Let me get through the next few

52
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:48,881
announcements really quick, then. You guys got to
see a video before this that Geek and Sundry put

53
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:54,832
together. It was a fun weekend shoot to talk about
the game Masquerada. I talked about it in previous

54
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:59,776
episodes, but it's an awesome PC RPG. I am so in
love with the process of us putting this together.

55
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:05,767
It's a great story, fantastic cast, incredible
writing, and very much hearkens to the isometric,

56
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:10,800
Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment-style RPG format
of the early 2000s. I highly recommend it. You

57
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:18,265
should check it out. I think it's in Steam now,
and hope you like it. Next up, my first episode of

58
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:25,747
the new GM Tips series is out today. It goes a
little behind my screen, and gives some ideas as

59
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:31,915
to how you can set up your own GM circumstance and
experience. Mind you, most of it's just fluff. You

60
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:35,737
don't need any of that to run a game. You can just
have books, dice, paper, and pens, and you're good

61
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:41,163
to go. But these are just suggestions and an
example of the things that I do to run my game

62
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:44,636
smoothly, and you should check it out if you'd
like it. New episodes will be coming out every

63
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:49,514
Wednesday on Alpha, I suppose, and then on
Thursdays coming out on YouTube and the website

64
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,587
proper.

65
00:25:50,587 --> 00:25:53,291
TRAVIS: Is it pronounced GM tips, or gmmm tips?

66
00:25:53,291 --> 00:26:00,537
MATT: Gmmm tips. They are now. It is now Matthew
Mercer's Gmmm Tips. Thank you, Travis.

67
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:02,337
Disadvantage.

68
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,663
(laughter)

69
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:12,274
MATT: So check that out. Also, my last
announcement for me. There's a project up on

70
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:19,581
Kickstarter right now called Open Legend RPG. It's
a cool new RPG system. Both myself and Ed

71
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:24,719
Greenwood, the creator of Faerun and the Forgotten
Realms, are contributing to this project. It looks

72
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:28,426
pretty cool, people involved are really nice, and
go ahead and check it out, see if it's your jam.

73
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:33,669
And if it is, you should go ahead and help support
it, so check it out. It's Open Legend RPG. That's

74
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:37,498
all my announcements. Does anybody else have
anything they want to talk about?

75
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:40,630
LAURA: What about our Halloween costume
competition?

76
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,989
SAM: Oh, yeah!

77
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:46,617
LAURA: I've been seeing some of them. It's
Critical Costumes, is the hashtag, right?

78
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:50,076
SAM: #CriticalCostumes. You explained the
competition?

79
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:54,659
LAURA: Yeah. Next week, I think, is where we're
stopping. Halloween will be the last day?

80
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,077
MARISHA: On Halloween.

81
00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:59,358
LAURA: Halloween's the last day to submit, and
then we're all just going to look at all your

82
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:01,335
costumes and just decide who we like.

83
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:04,956
MARISHA: I will say I had a cat dress up as my
character, so the bar is pretty high.

84
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:09,130
LAURA: I saw a really amazing Vex today. I'm just
saying, I may be biased.

85
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,477
SAM: So just to be clear, the winners are not
going to be announced next week. It's the week

86
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,421
after.

87
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,511
MATT: No, the week after. The first Thursday of
November, we'll be announcing the winners.

88
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:19,062
SAM: We don't know what the prizes are. But it
will include my shirts.

89
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:20,094
LIAM: Your sweaty shirts.

90
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:21,790
LAURA: But not that shirt.

91
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:28,458
SAM: Yeah, this is my shirt. Forever.

92
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:35,990
MATT: One of these days, you're going to wake up,
put a shirt on, and the universe is going to fold

93
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:46,163
in on you. I'm excited. All righty. Anything else?
All right, then. That being the case, let's go

94
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:50,345
ahead and dive down into tonight's episode
of Critical Role.

95
00:27:50,345 --> 00:29:27,050
[dramatic music]

96
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,528
MARISHA: --balanced breakfast!

97
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:34,812
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. I just physically
ordered the other torch, so that'll be fixed soon.

98
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:44,154
Because sometimes you just got to do it yourself.
Anyway, welcome back. So to continue from where we

99
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:51,259
left off for tonight's episode of Critical Role,
Vox Machina, our heroic players and characters, in

100
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:56,548
fighting their way across the land of Tal'Dorei
against the Chrome Conclave, a gathering of

101
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:03,456
ancient chromatic dragons that have torn the
current civilization asunder. They've gathered a

102
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:08,487
number of artifacts of old called the Vestiges of
Divergence and recently made allies with one of

103
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:14,339
these dragons, Raishan, the green dragon of the
conclave, apparently interested in revolting

104
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:21,374
against the conclave's leader, Thordak the Cinder
King. A tentative alliance has been forged and to

105
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:27,705
prove both the stalwartness of that alliance, as
well as to further your agenda against the

106
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:33,988
conclave, you all traveled back to Wildemount, to
the ruins of Draconia. With the help of the

107
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:39,950
Ravenites you set a trap for Vorugal, the Frigid
Doom. You summoned, using your single Gate scroll,

108
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:48,508
from the Abyss, Yenk the Goristro, a great,
powerful siege demon and caused it to battle with

109
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:55,724
the white dragon. Partway through, the encounter
got more intense, you all rushed into the fray. Got

110
00:30:55,724 --> 00:31:01,728
the crap kicked out of you in a lot of cases but
when all was said and done, with the aid of

111
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:05,878
Raishan, you felled Vorugal. The final shot being
landed by Vex'ahlia herself.

112
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,808
LAURA: Thank you.

113
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:16,547
MATT: You guys have now taken a moment. You've
discussed with Raishan to meet back in Whitestone,

114
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:23,763
after which she reverted form and vanished. And
you've now begun to collect your spoils and gather

115
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:31,370
what you can from the battlefield at this moment.
So that's where we pick up this week. What would

116
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,502
you like to do?

117
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:36,291
LIAM: Man, we've gotta find Larkin.

118
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:40,169
LAURA: Did you have dragon bits you wanted to
gather?

119
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:42,241
MARISHA: I did, very much so.

120
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:44,129
TALIESIN: And some Yenk, I imagine.

121
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:46,394
MARISHA: A little bit of Yenk, a little bit of
dragon.

122
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:48,346
LAURA: I got a little Yenk blood
already.

123
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:49,796
MATT: You did.

124
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:51,283
LIAM: Brazen, guys.

125
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:58,587
MATT: All right, so, you're heading to the dragon
or Yenk first?

126
00:31:58,587 --> 00:31:59,736
MARISHA: Dragon.

127
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:01,396
MATT: Okay, so you head to the dragon.

128
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:08,885
Okay. So you guys head over there. You now see
partially elements of the wall that had crumbled

129
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:15,634
in on Vorugal's body. You see now, emerging from
the center of the scales in the chest as it lays

130
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:22,564
on its back, slain, its throat torn out by
Raishan, a piercing tree begins to burrow its way

131
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:29,532
through the torso of the dragon and bloom
outwards. Waiting for that process to finish, you

132
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,008
bring out your carving dagger and--

133
00:32:32,008 --> 00:32:33,632
MARISHA: I patiently wait for the tree.

134
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:34,456
MATT: Okay.

135
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:35,951
MARISHA: I don't want to interrupt. That's rude.

136
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:42,151
MATT: It grows pretty fast as part of the
enchantment of Fenthras. So, that brief pause

137
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:51,307
completed, you go to town with your blade on the
dragon's corpse. Let's go ahead and make a check

138
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:52,733
on this. This would be--

139
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:53,653
MARISHA: Nature, right?

140
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:54,600
MATT: Yeah.

141
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,596
MARISHA: With advantage. Oh, that's good. 28.

142
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:07,960
MATT: 28, okay. It'll take you the better part of
about an hour to really harvest everything you

143
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,568
want from this that's usable, and that's with aid
from Scanlan, because it's a very big dragon, and

144
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:20,535
that's a pretty small blade. So you begin that
process.

145
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:29,386
LAURA: I can help. I want to go up and carve a
bear onto the tree growing out of Vorugal.

146
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:35,210
TALIESIN: I may lend my cut-dragon-like-butter
blade to this whole process.

147
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,695
MATT: Okay.

148
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:40,649
SAM: Can I just pull off a scale? A single scale.
Is that really hard to do?

149
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,596
MATT: Make a strength check.

150
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,744
SAM: Two.

151
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:51,530
MATT: You spend the next minute and a half going
(grunting sounds). It's not budging.

152
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,020
SAM: It's actually three.

153
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,750
MATT: Oh, the next minute and 20 seconds going
(grunting sounds).

154
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,058
SAM: Great.

155
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:03,626
MATT: You do manage to found a couple loose scales
on the ground nearby after you've thoroughly

156
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,765
embarrassed yourself.

157
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:11,877
SAM: I'll grab one and then I'll immediately start
yelling for Tooma. (yelling) Tooma!

158
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:15,123
MATT: Okay, while he's doing that, what are you
guys doing?

159
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:18,680
TRAVIS: Right, so the dragon's got booty, right?

160
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,544
LAURA: Yeah, like a lot.

161
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:25,766
TRAVIS: So I look over and they're working on the
dragon bits. Everything's cool? Yenk is like

162
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:28,832
melting into the snow, right, because he's like a
hell fiend or whatever?

163
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:29,935
MATT: Yeah.

164
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,572
TRAVIS: I take off running towards the lair.

165
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,420
LAURA: Grog!

166
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,088
SAM: I'm going to go with.

167
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:40,409
MATT: Grog's already run off. Scanlan's
following.

168
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,686
SAM: I'm going to Polymorph into an eagle.

169
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:45,659
LAURA: Fucking fuck! Do you guys have this?

170
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,596
MARISHA: Yeah.

171
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:52,465
LAURA: Give me a claw. I want a claw to wear around
my neck.

172
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,073
MARISHA: You're going to be like Mr. T.

173
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:59,569
LAURA: I want something to wear around my neck.
Fucking something, all right!

174
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,902
TALIESIN: We'll find something.

175
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:02,642
LAURA: I'll take off on the broom after Grog.

176
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,679
LIAM: Just scooping up Pike into a bit of a piggy
back ride and carrying her inside and we're going

177
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,896
to rest.

178
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:15,734
MATT: Okay. She's thoroughly hurt, but you still
have the entrance to the mansion. Yeah, so you

179
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:21,245
guys pull into there to rest for the moment. While
Grog, as you're running, this eagle comes up to

180
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:26,796
your side, is gaining on you a bit. As you come
over the top of this one little ridge area, as the

181
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:34,716
ravine begins to widen and head towards the lair
portion that Vorugal was using, you see before you

182
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:41,211
a group of about 22 or so armored dragonborn that
are currently jogging up the ramp in your

183
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:48,210
direction. As soon as you cross over the top they
come to a slower point, with their weapons out,

184
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:54,217
and you see one of them raise its hand. You
recognize Skork, who you met earlier, who goes,

185
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:57,526
"We've come to aid you!"

186
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:03,773
TAVIS: I'm still raging using Persistent Rage and
I point over my shoulder and yell, Dragon that way!

187
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:05,357
And I keep running past them.

188
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:09,864
MATT: All right! They pick up their weapons and keep
running past you as you [whoosh] through them, the eagle

189
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:11,004
following closely after.

190
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,013
SAM: Is Tooma with them?

191
00:36:12,013 --> 00:36:13,201
MATT: Tooma is not with them, no.

192
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:15,215
LAURA: I followed too. I am following as well.

193
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,785
MATT: Yeah, you coast up behind, you begin
catching up to Grog and the wayward eagle. You're

194
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:19,263
the fastest of everything right now.

195
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,711
SAM: I'm following him.

196
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:25,340
MATT: So you're staying back at same speed. Okay.
As you guys begin carving, you begin hearing the

197
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:32,364
footsteps approaching of numerous dragonborn. The
rest of you guys continue down the path. You see

198
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:39,330
the icy throne, if you will, of where Vorugal had
placed as the new lair on this northern portion of

199
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:45,903
the ravine. You guys that are staying behind, as
you're carving your way into the dragon, all of a

200
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:52,120
sudden you hear the footsteps and a bunch of these
dragonborn, armored, with scavenged pieces,

201
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:59,294
leather hide with metallic bits of armor. Weapons,
definitely not of the highest degree from what you

202
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:05,327
can tell, though some are ornate and seemingly
unused, maybe scavenged from the fall of Draconia.

203
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:12,018
They approach and slow their jog and look over
at the destroyed corpse of the dragon.

204
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:14,235
MARISHA: Hi.

205
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:15,369
TALIESIN: Things went well.

206
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,122
MARISHA: Man, how long of a jog is that?

207
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:23,625
MATT: They all look confused at each other and
start talking to each other in a language you

208
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,924
don't understand.

209
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:29,430
MARISHA: Man, ooh, Vex isn't here.

210
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:36,752
TALIESIN: No. All good. Good.

211
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:38,035
TRAVIS: Fuck.

212
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:46,025
MATT: They nod and Skork gives a respectful nod
and they all approach the dragon's corpse and

213
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,049
start hacking into it.

214
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,166
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, no. Hold on.

215
00:37:50,166 --> 00:38:09,275
TALIESIN: No. I'm going to point at all-- you all,
sun goes down, all of us drink back there.

216
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,081
Go back. Everything's fine.

217
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:15,786
MATT: Skork takes two steps forward and goes, "I
understand this speak."

218
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:21,942
TALIESIN: Oh, why didn't you say something? You're
standing there making us very nervous.

219
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:31,938
MATT: (disgruntled grunt) "Look. We have to come
to aid you in the battle as promised. You have

220
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:38,943
"seemingly done well without our presence. So let's
all harvest the uses of what remains of this beast."

221
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:46,350
TALIESIN: I'm fair with that, all right. Harvest
gently. We're trying to keep as much of it--

222
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:50,711
MARISHA: Yes, I'm working right here on this area
and Vex wants a claw.

223
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:58,685
MATT: "Take what you wish. We are interested
in hide and meat."

224
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:04,169
TALIESIN: And we are interested in scale, tooth,
and claw, and maybe some eyeballs, so that works

225
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:05,294
out very well.

226
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:06,175
MARISHA: And blood.

227
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:11,890
MATT: "Perhaps some teeth and claws as well. We
shall trade." (speaks Draconic) All of them rush

228
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:18,114
up and start hacking into the soft portions of the
underbelly, where it's been exposed from where you

229
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:22,524
guys have left large wounds and such and basically
start to carve huge bits of dragon meat off the body.

230
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:24,375
TALIESIN: Mind the tree. Mind the tree.

231
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:31,733
MATT: One of them was going for the tree and stops
like-- And then looks very confused that the tree

232
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:36,288
wasn't piercing through the dragon, but was rooted
inside of it. They all take a moment to start

233
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:41,524
carving around it. It's a very awkward. They don't
know what the hell happened and it looks very

234
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:44,407
strange from an outsider's perspective, but
they're trying to adjust best they can.

235
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,697
TRAVIS: New town square will be built around it.

236
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:54,834
MATT: In the meantime, the three of you guys coast
down towards the lair. You can still see all the

237
00:39:54,834 --> 00:40:03,257
ice spires that are jutting out from portions of
the snow, the various dragonborn corpses still

238
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:10,273
adorning a number of the spires. As you begin to
approach the throne of Vorugal, you can see

239
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:15,804
there's a group of about 15 or so dragonborn
currently there that are starting to climb up and

240
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:23,243
get to that portion to inspect. You see, first,
before anyone else does, Vex, that one of them

241
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:29,779
appears to be Tooma, who is walking with this
gnarled staff that she keeps to her side. And

242
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:32,948
they're all approaching and climbing up the sides
of the throne to get to the top.

243
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:36,104
LAURA: I shout out, don't go up there!

244
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:39,668
MATT: You shout that and there's a moment of
pause. Then, all of them turn and look in your

245
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,091
direction.

246
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:49,799
LAURA: I fly down close to Tooma and say quietly,
Thordak has means of seeing through the stones up

247
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:56,756
there. If you go up top, it's possible he'll be
able to know that Vorugal has fallen. He might

248
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:57,968
already know.

249
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:06,038
MATT: "This is good to know." (speaks Draconic)
And the dragonborn around slowly pull backwards.

250
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:12,622
You understand her saying, "Hold off. Words of
warning." They all pull back and gather around

251
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:21,227
you, and stand, awaiting what this conversation is
going to entail as Tooma steps forward to you. "So

252
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:25,512
"am I to understand, then, that the dragon has
fallen?"

253
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,085
LAURA: (laughing) Yes.

254
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:32,516
SAM: I'll drop my form and throw the scale in
front of her. It's done. There's your fucking

255
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:33,849
dragon.

256
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:44,985
MATT: She looks over at the rest of the people who
are all looking towards her for confirmation. She

257
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:57,179
goes, "You came to us with words. You stood behind
them. You displayed honor and honesty, things we

258
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:10,546
"find rare in supply outside of our people. Us, the
Ravenites, survivors of chain and frost, are now

259
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:14,830
"truly free. We thank you."

260
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,283
LAURA: And we thank you.

261
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:25,454
SAM: But we'll need something more than just
thanks. We have two requests to make of you. One,

262
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:31,231
this is not the final fight. There will be more,
and unlike this fight, we would expect your aid in

263
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:34,391
the next one. Is that something you can guarantee
us?

264
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:43,132
MATT: "I am curious as to what you require from
us."

265
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:50,102
SAM: We don't know yet, but you have many men, and
they seem like good fighters, so we may call upon

266
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:52,146
you in the future.

267
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:53,701
MATT: "Against what foe?"

268
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:59,305
LAURA: Thordak the Ancient. He was commander of
all of these dragons.

269
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:11,872
MATT: You see her face immediately goes from that
calm, welcoming, elated expression she had a

270
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:17,652
moment ago to this guarded, retracted position
where she shifts her weight onto the back leg and--

271
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:28,322
LAURA: You are not beholden to us. We ask this of
your own free will. All of Tal'Dorei is at risk.

272
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:43,564
MATT: "We are not an army. We wish to help in <i>this</i>
fight, for we had a stake in it, both of us. This

273
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:52,848
"was a mutual arrangement. You owe us nothing. We
owe you nothing. But we are not ready to continue

274
00:43:52,848 --> 00:43:57,048
"the fight immediately with a more dangerous foe
than this one."

275
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:03,642
SAM: Hopefully, it won't be immediately. And might
I remind you that you did <i>not</i> help us in this

276
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,423
fight. We did it all by ourselves.

277
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:12,024
MATT: "Who do you think arranged, through previous
conversation, to send the dragon your way into the

278
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:20,521
"trap that you had sprung? At my suggestion of the
place of proper, and most conventional and helpful

279
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:21,815
"circumstances?"

280
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:24,074
LAURA: It's true, Scanlan, they did help a lot in
that regard.

281
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:27,461
MATT: "We may not have the might to finish the
dragon--"

282
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:31,703
SAM: You told us that you would have men there to
help us, and there was nothing. We almost died.

283
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,163
MATT: "We sent men your way!"

284
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:34,555
SAM: You knew when the fight was.

285
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:40,365
MATT: "We knew when to begin the fight, but we do
not have means of travelling as fast as a dragon!"

286
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:46,590
TRAVIS: I'm running around like a cracked-out PCP
addict in the background. Just looking on the

287
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,576
ground for booty, that's all.

288
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:52,081
MATT: Perception check.

289
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:53,216
TRAVIS: One.

290
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:54,935
(laughter)

291
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:57,805
MATT: There is snow and ice and it's pissing you
off!

292
00:44:57,805 --> 00:45:00,639
TRAVIS: I'm doing the dog thing.

293
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:05,586
MATT: More snow. More and more snow. In the middle
of this conversation, some of it starts spattering

294
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:13,560
the side of Vex. You're like, "Stop it!" Angrily
rage-looting nothing. (laughs)

295
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:21,203
LAURA: Draconia has had a history of separating
itself from the rest of Tal'Dorei. This is an

296
00:45:21,203 --> 00:45:30,146
opportunity for <i>you</i> to welcome other
communities, to become part of the rest of the world.

297
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:46,061
MATT: "You are right. [no audio] And from this, I think we
could try to rebuild, a new home for the

298
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:58,016
"dragonborn of Wildemount. Learn from the mistakes
of our predecessors and our oppressors. We are no

299
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:05,082
"majestic mage nation by any means, but we can
learn."

300
00:46:05,124 --> 00:46:08,896
LAURA: You are strong.

301
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:19,636
MAT: "<i>They</i> are strong. My time is nearly up. But
what time I have left, I fully intend to make sure

302
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:24,449
"that there is a future for my people. For the
Ravenites."

303
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:34,921
SAM: One more request, before we go. Once we're
long gone, you can feel free to inspect this hill

304
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:42,093
where the dragon slept, and be very careful in
disarming any traps that you might find there. I

305
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:51,260
would ask you one favor for us: we lost a friend
in this fight, a dragonborn. He's buried near

306
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:58,744
here. We'll tell you where. We would like a proper
tomb for him on this hill, where the dragon slept.

307
00:46:58,744 --> 00:47:05,638
Could you build a statue, a fine statue, a
handsome statue of Tiberius Stormwind, and bury

308
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:12,063
him underneath it. And on the pedestal, could you
please write, "I encourage peace."

309
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:23,563
MATT: She looks over at one of the nearby
dragonborn. "This is Korsa. He is our finest

310
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:27,948
"stonesmith. I will see to it that it is done."

311
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:34,209
SAM: Teach your people of him, your offspring,
that he was a brave dragonborn that wanted to

312
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:36,284
unify all of your peoples.

313
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:48,394
MATT: "This can be done. (sighs) This mound
represents the spoils of the remains of Draconia

314
00:47:48,394 --> 00:48:02,121
"the dragon greedily stole, hoarded, and forced us
to gather at the base of its icy seat. This will

315
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:13,160
"be the beginning of our new nation, and with this,
we will make sure this statue comes to bear."

316
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,001
SAM: Good luck.

317
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:21,213
TRAVIS: Where the fuck is it?! That's all you hear
me say.

318
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:23,065
(laughter)

319
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:25,508
SAM: What are you looking for?

320
00:48:25,508 --> 00:48:26,984
TRAVIS: Help me look!

321
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:28,159
SAM: For what? What are we looking for?

322
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,407
TRAVIS: Just dig!

323
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,412
(laughter)

324
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:33,567
TRAVIS: Can I make another perception check,
please?

325
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:34,611
MATT: No.

326
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,646
TRAVIS: No?!

327
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,992
MATT: You can, Scanlan.

328
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:40,520
SAM: What am I looking for? Grog, what am I
looking for?

329
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,286
TRAVIS: We're looking for that booty.

330
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:47,797
SAM: Booty? Just dragon booty? It would be up
where the dragon sleeps, not down here.

331
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:50,360
LAURA: There's some under the ice right here.

332
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,955
SAM: All right, I will peer down into the ice
below us with my 21 perception.

333
00:48:56,955 --> 00:49:05,198
MATT: Okay. You glance down, and after pushing
some of the snow out of the way, it's amazing that

334
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:14,474
Grog didn't see this at all, but not really when
you think about it. Encased in this pedestal that

335
00:49:14,474 --> 00:49:24,534
Vorugal had taken as a perch, beneath multiple
feet of thick, locked ice, you see an incredible

336
00:49:24,534 --> 00:49:31,616
amount of hoarded gold, silver, platinum
glittering as bits of light break through the

337
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:37,992
overhead clouds, as the sleet is still raining
down in places. Bits of it gleam and shift and

338
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:45,138
shimmer. You can see finely crafted knick-knacks
and statues and gems and antiqued metals all

339
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:52,521
buried deep beneath this platform. It looks to be
pieces of ornate armor and weaponry, all sorts of

340
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:57,497
a random assortment of items that are locked
beneath feet of ice, right there before you.

341
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,364
SAM: Nothing there, Grog. Sorry.

342
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,451
TRAVIS: No! It has to be here somewhere!

343
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:06,286
SAM: (whispering) Just look right there, friend.

344
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:07,125
TRAVIS: What?

345
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,018
SAM: (whispering) Right there.

346
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:10,235
TRAVIS: Where? What?

347
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:11,661
SAM: He's my BFF.

348
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:12,712
TRAVIS: I see it?

349
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:18,017
MATT: Oh yeah, once he points it out, you
immediately clarify and the red haze that was

350
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:20,181
covering your eyes suddenly fades and you see
shiny.

351
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:25,394
TRAVIS: Can I use the siege portion of the
Titanstone Knuckles and start smacking the shit

352
00:50:25,394 --> 00:50:27,052
out of this ice trying to get down there?

353
00:50:27,052 --> 00:50:28,061
MATT: Yes, you can.

354
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:29,345
TRAVIS: Just like (smashing noises).

355
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:32,552
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

356
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:38,602
TRAVIS: I deal double damage against objects or
structures.

357
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:45,831
MATT: Yeah, and as you start, each punch, the ice
(splintering noise) more cracks begin to spider

358
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:50,346
out. An incredible feat of strength and you can
see the dragonborn take a few steps back at this

359
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:55,546
view, and Tooma is almost intrigued at this point,
staring with this grin across her face as this

360
00:50:55,546 --> 00:51:04,317
symbolic destruction of what represented Vorugal's
lording over their entire life is being ripped

361
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:13,115
apart by this half-giant madman. A few more
punches through and a whole portion slides off and

362
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:17,337
you have to move out of the way. You knock it
aside with your fist and keep punching through and

363
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:22,825
eventually you get about, over the next ten or 15
minutes, breaking through enough of the ice that

364
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:29,635
you start hitting (clanging), starting to hit the
actual outskirts of this large pile of gold pieces.

365
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:35,279
LAURA: Wait, Grog. Can I check for any traps or is
it like totally fine? Because I've been here

366
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:37,288
before and it's not pleasant.

367
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:39,635
TRAVIS: I really wouldn't mind.

368
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:45,151
LAURA: Investigation? 18?

369
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:51,799
MATT: Okay, glancing about best you can in the
vicinity, you don't see any traps.

370
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:58,221
LAURA: What about the gemstones? Those are up
high. I'm staying away from those.

371
00:51:58,221 --> 00:52:03,349
SAM: We're outside the perimeter of the gemstones
or the the main portion of the lair, right?

372
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:13,476
MATT: Yeah, the orbs are embedded in the top
restful area. The actual hoard is hidden, locked

373
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:17,871
beneath the ice at the base of this large
platform, so you're essentially punching through

374
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:24,979
the bottom portion. Much like any sandcastle, the
further you go, the less structural integrity it

375
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:33,454
has. You're starting to make headway into
releasing and finding access to some of the horde

376
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:34,602
yourself.

377
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:39,967
TRAVIS: We need heat, and more than my wee urine
can generate.

378
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,489
SAM: I can give us a little bit of fire?

379
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:47,047
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, or get Keyleth over here.

380
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:51,314
LAURA: Do you have dragon's breath?

381
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:57,871
MATT: She points to two of them and brings them
over and two of the dragonborn step forward and

382
00:52:57,871 --> 00:53:04,044
release this torrent of flame into the area that
you've already carved out.

383
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:05,381
SAM: Ooh, they can do that?

384
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:09,766
MATT: Yeah, it only lasts a few seconds and it
causes a portion of it to melt back, but it's

385
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:15,101
still extremely strong ice and it didn't have as
much of an impact as you hoped it would've. This

386
00:53:15,101 --> 00:53:21,745
is very, very sturdy white dragon-conjured,
ice-protected walls.

387
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:24,815
LAURA: Just keep on punching it, Grog.

388
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:25,762
TRAVIS: Really?

389
00:53:25,762 --> 00:53:27,573
LAURA: Just punch it. You're doing some good
damage.

390
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:28,712
TRAVIS: But no fireballs?

391
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:32,009
SAM: I have a fireball. I'll send a fireball over
there. Back up a little bit.

392
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,023
TRAVIS: Why? What if I want to be close?

393
00:53:34,023 --> 00:53:35,614
SAM: Well, you'll get burned.

394
00:53:35,614 --> 00:53:38,064
LIAM: You're way down by 101 hit points, though.

395
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:40,881
TRAVIS: I know. Yeah, I'm still up in the three
digits. Let's make it exciting.

396
00:53:40,881 --> 00:53:42,888
SAM: I'm not going to burn you, Grog. Just take
ten feet.

397
00:53:42,888 --> 00:53:44,481
TRAVIS: All right, all right! Ten feet!

398
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:51,632
SAM: All right, I'll send a wand of fireballs
down. I don't know, is that magic actually hot

399
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:52,859
when it goes off?

400
00:53:52,859 --> 00:54:01,222
MATT: Yeah, it's hot and it's an explosion. It's
not just fire. It's an explosion. So it detonates

401
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:11,314
from the inside of that small concave path that you
had punched through and as it hits and detonates

402
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:24,476
you can see the ice further crack. The ice begins
to crack even further and portions of it, you see

403
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:30,310
a bit of snow bank that had gathered at the top
shakes free and off the side, revealing some of

404
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,420
the upper platform.

405
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,971
SAM: We don't want to make too much of a
disturbance here.

406
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,222
LAURA: No, we don't.

407
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:36,874
SAM: Let's just take some stuff on the outside.

408
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:41,412
TRAVIS: Is there any free platinum or gold or
little bits I can start to put in my hands?

409
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:46,328
MATT: Yeah, you can start scooping bits.

410
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:51,149
LAURA: You might want to ask Tooma if she has a
problem with you taking all of Draconia's gold.

411
00:54:51,149 --> 00:55:03,160
TRAVIS: You saw what his face did, didn't you?
Tooma, we are about to unsheathe and reveal a

412
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,251
great fortune, of which we have very little
interest because honestly it weighs us down.

413
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:14,170
We're, like, plenty loaded already. However, it is
a tradition to take little bits here and there as

414
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,439
keepsakes.

415
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:27,447
MATT: "The spoils here were largely collected from
the wreckage of our captors and much of the gold

416
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:35,366
"here was earned through our blood and turmoil.
However, we were able to free ourselves and have

417
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:43,989
"access to this fortune a great deal thanks to your
aid. We are more than willing to divide this

418
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,309
"between your folk and ours."

419
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:56,274
TRAVIS: That sounds most generous. Shall we look
for specifically interesting little bits, or just

420
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:57,779
grab the platinum?

421
00:55:57,779 --> 00:55:59,517
SAM: Just grab whatever's closest and leave.

422
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:06,519
TRAVIS: Are there any interesting-looking weapons
or unique items that are out of the ordinary?

423
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:08,485
MATT: Make an investigation check.

424
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:10,956
LAURA: Any looking-magically thingies?

425
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:12,518
MATT: Make an investigation check.

426
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:15,830
TRAVIS: Yes! Minus two. 17.

427
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:27,531
SAM: I will look for weapons of any sort. Ooh, 30.
Investigation, right?

428
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:28,674
MATT: Yeah.

429
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,182
LAURA: 16.

430
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:35,160
MATT: (laughing) Do you want to add your bardic
inspiration dice to that to be a dick?

431
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,902
LAURA: Inspire me!

432
00:56:36,902 --> 00:56:38,289
SAM: Did you suck or something?

433
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:39,681
LAURA: Yeah, I only got 16.

434
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:48,596
SAM: Okay, I will add my bardic inspiration. I
will sing to her. (singing) Something in the way I

435
00:56:48,596 --> 00:57:00,487
wink, inspires you like no other gnome can.
Something makes you stop and think, how did he get

436
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:04,961
so handsome? How did he get so suave?

437
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:08,496
LAURA: Six extra points, so 22.

438
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:11,497
MATT: All right, there you go.

439
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:29,680
Now Critical Role owes a royalty to the
Beatles. All right, so, Grog, you find a painted

440
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,068
gold war mask that looks really cool and nasty
with the lower jaw. You're like, yes and you can

441
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:36,102
put it on.

442
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:39,255
TRAVIS: Yep, in fact, I lick it knowing that it's
cold and I stick it to my face.

443
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,611
MATT: Okay. Your tongue sticks to the mask.

444
00:57:41,611 --> 00:57:42,989
TRAVIS: Fuck! And I rip it off.

445
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:52,324
MATT: You rip it off, all right. You take a point
of damage. And your tongue is pounding with pain

446
00:57:52,324 --> 00:58:02,027
(throbbing) as the top layer of skin has been torn
off your tongue. But the mask is still yours. You

447
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:09,917
do also find a really beautiful black stone. It's
really well cut and it's about that big and it's

448
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,749
really pretty and dark and awesome.

449
00:58:12,749 --> 00:58:15,259
TRAVIS: I love stones. I'm a fucking fan.

450
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:30,097
MATT: And a whole shitton of gold and platinum.
You, looking through, you find a beautiful reddish

451
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:36,243
ruby gem that has this slightly gold refraction in
the center of it that's somewhat symmetrical, it

452
00:58:36,243 --> 00:58:46,122
looks otherworldly almost. It's beautiful. You see
deeper within the actual hoard a ship's mast that

453
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:52,458
was plated with gold that has been jammed in the
center of the hoard, wreckage that was dragged

454
00:58:52,458 --> 00:59:03,333
here and included in the hoard. You do also see,
amongst some of the gold, a small vial with liquid

455
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:06,186
that is unaffected by the freezing temperatures
around it.

456
00:59:06,186 --> 00:59:08,962
LAURA: What color is the liquid?

457
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:13,081
MATT: The liquid is-- let me look that up.

458
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:16,632
TRAVIS: This is my favourite part, getting new
shit.

459
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:26,014
MATT: It is like a thick syrupy metallic, like a
liquid iron, a reddish metallic tint to it.

460
00:59:26,014 --> 00:59:30,416
TRAVIS: I had an idea until reddish, but I don't
know anymore.

461
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:41,263
MATT: And you find a pair of boots that are made
from a very thick, dark brown hide.

462
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:44,060
LAURA: Another boots of haste! For sure!

463
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,355
TRAVIS: They're probably like elephant strength
boots.

464
00:59:46,355 --> 00:59:50,615
LAURA: Definitely boots of haste! Pair of boots
out of brown leather, you said?

465
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:56,608
MATT: Yeah, a dark brown leather, not very
elaborate in their design, but they're well made

466
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:59,823
and seemingly have braved the cold weather well
enough.

467
00:59:59,823 --> 01:00:02,143
TALIESIN: They're Boots of Taste that you have.

468
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:03,777
TRAVIS: I appreciate well-made boots.

469
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:05,307
LIAM and TALIESIN: They're Uggs.

470
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:07,944
TRAVIS: Do we have an approximation of the gold and
platinum?

471
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:11,456
MATT: We'll get to that in a second. Sam!

472
01:00:11,456 --> 01:00:14,410
SAM: I'm sorry, who?

473
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,716
MATT: Scanlan.

474
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:16,670
SAM: Thank you.

475
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,472
LIAM: Whoa! What just happened?

476
01:00:18,472 --> 01:00:33,740
MATT: You find amongst this a platinum bracelet
set with a gorgeous sapphire that looks like it's

477
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:43,010
probably worth quite a bit. You also find another
unbroken vial amongst a series of other vials that

478
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:47,000
did break in the process of being hoarded here,
the liquid spilled out. There's one unbroken vial.

479
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:58,430
This one is a yellowish fluid with black swirls
that shift on their own inside the vial's

480
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:05,668
contents. As you shake it, you see they move at a
faster speed and then slow down in a reverse

481
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:07,799
direction. It's a very interesting pattern.

482
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:09,519
TALIESIN: Lava lamp.

483
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:16,162
MATT: Kind of. Underneath that vial, you see a
very beautiful--

484
01:01:16,162 --> 01:01:21,544
LAURA: Ooh, sheets of paper!

485
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:26,254
TRAVIS: I love this shit. It's like walking into a
Toys 'R' Us. It's the fucking best. It's like,

486
01:01:26,254 --> 01:01:27,591
"Which way do I go?!"

487
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,301
LIAM: Find the Plate of the Dawnmartyr.

488
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:32,672
SAM: That was easy!

489
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:41,725
MATT: There you go! You find a gold and platinum
band that is two separate bands that are woven

490
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:43,878
together like a braid in a band.

491
01:01:43,878 --> 01:01:45,782
SAM: Like a back braid?

492
01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:54,556
MATT: Kind of. Other than that, it looks nice.
There's no other defining markings on it. Looks

493
01:01:54,556 --> 01:02:01,116
like it would be worth quite a bit. You do, also,
as you rolled ridiculously high, in pulling the

494
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:07,231
ring out and the vial, you glance over and a
handle is embedded in a large part of the gold.

495
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:14,092
You go and grab it and it's actually a pretty big
handle once you get your gnomish hand on it. You

496
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:27,199
pull and you pull forth a very beautiful platinum
greatsword. It has a series of small symbols

497
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:36,003
carved along the base of the blade on each side.
The handle comes a gradual upward curve. It looks

498
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:42,701
beautiful, ornamental, like something you'd see in
a temple as part of a centerpiece. But it's

499
01:02:42,701 --> 01:02:48,488
weighted properly for a greatsword and is far too
big for you to ever possibly muster in battle.

500
01:02:48,488 --> 01:02:51,491
SAM: I can't use this, so I'll just leave it.

501
01:02:51,491 --> 01:02:56,317
TRAVIS: Wait! Let's not be hasty! My god, it's
beautiful!

502
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:57,895
SAM: Do you want it?

503
01:02:57,895 --> 01:03:01,502
TRAVIS: I'm very emotional about this right now.
Can I check it for traps?

504
01:03:01,502 --> 01:03:02,934
SAM: Check it for traps.

505
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:04,501
MATT: Make an investigation check.

506
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:06,403
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

507
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:10,242
LAURA: It is a natural 20, oh my god.

508
01:03:10,242 --> 01:03:16,341
MATT: You have never been so sure in your life
that this sword: totally not trapped.

509
01:03:16,341 --> 01:03:21,387
TALIESIN: I'm so hoping it talks to you now, I'm
so hoping it starts talking to you.

510
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:22,574
TRAVIS: 'Tis clean.

511
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:23,433
SAM: 'Tis clean?

512
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,356
TRAVIS: Yes.

513
01:03:24,356 --> 01:03:27,653
SAM: You hold it, I can't hold it, it's too heavy.
It weighs as much as I do.

514
01:03:27,653 --> 01:03:33,776
LAURA: How's it feel, Grog?

515
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:37,206
TRAVIS: Feels like money, money, money.

516
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:40,928
LAURA: Speaking of money, money, money.

517
01:03:40,928 --> 01:03:48,062
MATT: As you begin pulling out these materials, a
series of the other Ravenites start gathering

518
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:53,213
gold, filling sacks and having to pass them off.
You see now two of them are pulling two big carts

519
01:03:53,213 --> 01:04:00,422
over and are loading up cash in the area. This is
going to push your bag of holding.

520
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:02,790
TRAVIS: That's why I said we can't take that
much.

521
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,505
LAURA: But if it's platinum, it'll help.

522
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:08,799
MARISHA: More bang for our buck.

523
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,062
SAM: What can we lose from the bag of holding?

524
01:04:11,062 --> 01:04:13,625
TRAVIS: I'm very emotional about some of this.

525
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:20,815
MATT: You get about 20 minutes of gathering gold
and platinum pieces from the section you have

526
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:27,218
access to. You could get more, if you continue to
dig beneath, probably. You manage to pull roughly,

527
01:04:27,218 --> 01:04:34,872
between the three of you, 18,000 gold pieces and
about 12,000 platinum pieces.

528
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:39,314
(yelling)

529
01:04:39,314 --> 01:04:41,899
TRAVIS: Forget the dragons, let's go buy real
estate.

530
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:45,973
MATT: That's a third of what's in the hoard right
now.

531
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:47,973
LIAM: Park Place, motherfucker!

532
01:04:47,973 --> 01:04:49,723
TRAVIS: Build a fucking water park, let's go!

533
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:53,867
LAURA: We don't need any more than-- This is
really nice.

534
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:56,037
TALIESIN: Let's build a condominium.

535
01:04:56,037 --> 01:04:57,605
LIAM: Condos in Marquet.

536
01:04:57,605 --> 01:05:00,690
MARISHA: Parking garage, that's where it's at.

537
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,334
LAURA: How many gold is a platinum?

538
01:05:02,334 --> 01:05:04,939
MATT: For the gold to platinum transition here--

539
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:12,412
TRAVIS: It's a lot. Scrooge McDuck over here is
fucking swimming in that shit.

540
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:14,513
SAM: With Brexit, it's not worth as much any
more.

541
01:05:14,513 --> 01:05:16,364
MATT: Ten gold pieces per platinum.

542
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:17,216
LAURA: How many?

543
01:05:17,216 --> 01:05:24,585
SAM: <i>Ten</i> gold pieces per platinum. So that's
another 120 grand. Grog. Vex. We don't need to

544
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:25,864
tell the others about this

545
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:27,225
LAURA: They don't need to know. No!

546
01:05:27,225 --> 01:05:30,926
SAM: We could go to a warm place, the three of us,
and live out the rest of our days.

547
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:33,259
TRAVIS: We'll build a bank. It'll just be us.

548
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,452
SAM: They'll never find us. We have the Dust of
Tracelessness.

549
01:05:35,452 --> 01:05:36,705
LAURA: I'm tempted. This is amazing.

550
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:38,267
TRAVIS: Right. We kill Vex after the first month.

551
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,445
LAURA: Wait, I can hear you.

552
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:40,484
TRAVIS: I was joking.

553
01:05:40,484 --> 01:05:42,305
SAM: We might need her to restart civilization.

554
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,402
TRAVIS: True, true.

555
01:05:43,402 --> 01:05:49,395
LAURA: Oh, you know what? Let's go back. You lost
me. I'm out.

556
01:05:49,395 --> 01:05:51,772
(laughter)

557
01:05:51,772 --> 01:06:01,267
LIAM: Meanwhile, for the last twenty minutes, I've
been combing blood out of Pike's hair, and we've

558
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:09,449
been having god talk, and as I put little fun buns
in Pike's hair I say, "You know, sometimes I feel

559
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:15,191
"like she is right there with me. I ask questions
and I know the answers, but most of the time I

560
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:19,540
"don't know anything. Does the balance ever
shift?"

561
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:26,639
MATT: "No, not really. It's part of what's great
about it, is you put your trust into them and

562
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,242
"everything turns out okay."

563
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:32,748
LIAM: That is so cool.

564
01:06:32,748 --> 01:06:35,696
MATT: "You saw her, she punched a dragon for me!"

565
01:06:35,696 --> 01:06:42,397
LIAM: We've got to find Larkin though, what do we
do about Larkin?

566
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:44,300
LAURA: Okay, all right.

567
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,590
LIAM: You're not here!

568
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:52,959
MATT: "I didn't like Larkin very much. It's
probably for the best."

569
01:06:52,959 --> 01:06:58,492
LIAM: Aye, but he's out here on his own in the
cold. Ravenites everywhere!

570
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:01,689
MATT: "Dwarves are made of hardy stuff, I'm sure
he'll be okay."

571
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,709
LIAM: You're probably right. Let me even you off.

572
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:08,769
MATT: (pained) "Thank you."

573
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:10,618
MARISHA: What did we find?

574
01:07:10,618 --> 01:07:13,229
(laughter)

575
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,334
SAM: Ten dragon scales, the end.

576
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:26,253
MATT: All right, come back to you guys. So Vorugal
is butchered in the center of the snow here.

577
01:07:26,253 --> 01:07:33,175
Strangely, as you begin to carve, the air, as
freezing as it is, actual touch on the skin of

578
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:37,332
Vorugal is colder, and there's a few moments where
your fingers begin to adhere to the cold and you

579
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:44,888
have to pull back a bit. But you do manage to
carve from the hide, if you can carry it properly,

580
01:07:44,888 --> 01:07:48,647
about 150 pounds of dragon hide.

581
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:52,824
MARISHA: Oh jeez. Oh boy.

582
01:07:52,824 --> 01:07:55,341
LAURA: How much?

583
01:07:55,341 --> 01:07:56,809
TALIESIN: 150 pounds.

584
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:00,785
LAURA: We got 40 pounds of black dragonhide in the
Bag of Holding.

585
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,717
MARISHA: Well we now apparently have 150 pounds.

586
01:08:03,717 --> 01:08:08,255
TALIESIN: We're going to have to fill the
Whitestone coffers with some of this stuff when we

587
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,279
get back.

588
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:15,210
SAM: Grog is dumping stuff out of our Bag of
Holding.

589
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:19,295
TRAVIS: So one black studded dwarven armor suit,
because Pike's the only one that wears full armor.

590
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:25,804
There's another full set of regular plate armor.
That's going too. There's a totally decomposed orc

591
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:35,471
head. A brain chunk, two dark elf heads, one
random arm, a piece of bulette armor.

592
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:38,687
LIAM: That shit has been festering for months!

593
01:08:38,687 --> 01:08:41,312
TRAVIS: Twelve beef jerky strips are going.

594
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:43,445
TALIESIN: I was saving that!

595
01:08:43,445 --> 01:08:46,719
MATT: As you're doing this, Tooma is watching you,
going--

596
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:53,679
TRAVIS: By the way, this is totally up for grabs,
anytime you want. You say something to me and

597
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,192
we'll work it out.

598
01:08:55,192 --> 01:09:02,746
MATT: (speaks Draconic) Another dragonborn walks
over and picks up the beef jerky strips, hands

599
01:09:02,746 --> 01:09:05,056
them to Tooma, and Tooma keeps watching you all,
chewing on one.

600
01:09:05,056 --> 01:09:07,325
LIAM: They're starving.

601
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:09,683
TRAVIS: Those are super fresh.

602
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:13,844
(laughter)

603
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:21,818
TRAVIS: I'm throwing out a greatsword and
replacing the platinum greatsword in its spot so

604
01:09:21,818 --> 01:09:27,101
that should make enough weight out. Bye, black
studded dwarven armor. That was the first thing in

605
01:09:27,101 --> 01:09:28,703
the bag of holding.

606
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,109
SAM: By the way, excellent note-taking and keeping
track of what's been in the bag of holding.

607
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,212
LAURA: Yeah, that's great.

608
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,430
MATT: Well done.

609
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,437
TRAVIS: Half of that body part stuff came out as
gelatinous poo.

610
01:09:38,437 --> 01:09:41,985
MATT: Yeah, it's the gamiest of gamey meat you've
ever touched.

611
01:09:41,985 --> 01:09:47,582
TRAVIS: Just strings of-- You pull it up and you
got to wrap it up in the string and toss it.

612
01:09:47,582 --> 01:09:51,260
MATT: It is why I love the word "slough."

613
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,865
(disgusted groaning)

614
01:09:54,865 --> 01:10:10,074
MATT: You guys pull away portions of that, Kima
helping out where she can. The sweat beads on her

615
01:10:10,074 --> 01:10:16,898
forehead; even among the cold exterior, she's a
workhorse. You also manage to pry from Vorugal's

616
01:10:16,898 --> 01:10:25,082
mouth 20 individual dragon teeth that are
harvestable outside of the ones the other

617
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:36,400
Ravenites take for themselves. You manage to get
six dragon talons pulled from the whole body, and

618
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:42,097
about-- let's see, with all the destruction of the
outside, and there is this creeping ice that's

619
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:49,792
beginning to freeze the body from the inside,
post-death-- the hide includes the scales, you

620
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:55,795
have to pull off the scales and destroy the hide,
and any other organs? You said the eyes, you were

621
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:57,199
thinking about taking?

622
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,475
MARISHA: Blood. Eyes.

623
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:03,660
MATT: Do you have any more empty vials?

624
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:07,785
TALIESIN: Empty vials? I'm out of vials.

625
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:14,855
LAURA: Did you take any healing potions? If you
did you'd have an empty healing potion vial.

626
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:20,238
TALIESIN: In theory then, I have three empty vials
because I did have three healing potions that I've used.

627
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:23,691
MATT: We'll say you go ahead and recork three
vials of white dragon blood.

628
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:25,509
TALIESIN: Thank you.

629
01:11:25,509 --> 01:11:26,888
MATT: Anything else?

630
01:11:26,888 --> 01:11:27,933
MARISHA: No.

631
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:31,487
TALIESIN: I'm going to go sit down for a little
while, and breathe.

632
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,422
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to go into the mansion as
well.

633
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:38,941
MATT: Okay. So you guys go ahead and join Vax and
Pike. Kima comes and joins you as well, to rest

634
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:42,379
for a moment, while the rest of the Ravenites
begin tearing off pieces of Vorugal's body,

635
01:11:42,379 --> 01:11:48,841
leaving the ribcage, the spine. They pull most of
the organs out of it, but the tree itself is

636
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:52,987
rooted into the ribcage and the roots reach down
and burrow into the ground beneath it. It's left

637
01:11:52,987 --> 01:12:02,160
this really interesting sculpture that they've
torn everything away from. At this point now, the

638
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,918
Ravenites have descended upon the interior of the
hoard, and they're hacking away at bits of ice to

639
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:14,534
open up more of the space beneath, while keeping a
very careful eye to make sure the structure

640
01:12:14,534 --> 01:12:18,883
remains intact. You guys have gathered what you
decided to take from the hoard, and are doing what?

641
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:27,441
TRAVIS: Scanlan. Vex. We should disable the orbs,
right?

642
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:28,676
LAURA: I don't know how to.

643
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:30,060
TRAVIS: Just beat the shit out of them.

644
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:33,091
SAM: Wouldn't that alert Thordak?

645
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,078
TRAVIS: We don't want to taunt him first?

646
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:41,739
LAURA: I'd rather him not know, right now, that
Vorugal's dead because--

647
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:48,307
SAM: He would instantly know that we're not in our
home base, he could launch an attack on that place.

648
01:12:48,307 --> 01:12:53,668
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe let's not do that just yet.

649
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:56,518
TRAVIS: But what if he comes here?

650
01:12:56,518 --> 01:13:06,057
LAURA: Well if he does, hopefully they'll be
inside their caves? I don't think he's going to

651
01:13:06,057 --> 01:13:11,409
leave Emon to come check out what's going on with
Vorugal, unless he knows that Vorugal's dead.

652
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:17,467
TRAVIS: All right. Shall we check in with the
other members first, before we biggity-bounce?

653
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:21,009
LAURA: Well, let's go back to the mansion. Maybe
we can destroy it on the way out, if we feel

654
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:22,572
necessary.

655
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:27,322
TRAVIS: What about that big golden mast? You think
there's a golden ship under there?

656
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:29,045
LAURA: What if there's a skyship in here?

657
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:33,429
SAM: I assume it wouldn't fly very well, but all
right.

658
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:36,963
LAURA: Maybe that's how the Ravenites can get to
Emon, if they can help us?

659
01:13:36,963 --> 01:13:38,551
TRAVIS: It was made of gold, right?

660
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:42,555
MATT: Gold plating around it. There are portions
of it where you can see the wooden mast with large

661
01:13:42,555 --> 01:13:43,579
bands of gold.

662
01:13:43,579 --> 01:13:45,105
LAURA: Did it look like airship or normal ship?

663
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:53,179
MATT: It was hard to tell. From what you could
tell, it is a mast. The airships you've seen do

664
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,615
not have masts, since they do not use the wind.

665
01:13:55,615 --> 01:13:57,057
LAURA: Oh, right.

666
01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:04,333
MATT: So it was most likely a sea-faring ship, and
was torn asunder, from a great distance and then

667
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,649
dragged here as part of the hoard by Vorugal.

668
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:10,113
SAM: What are we going to do with a mast?

669
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:16,501
LAURA: I have no idea. Maybe on the way out we can
see if it's uncovered any more.

670
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:22,171
SAM: We'll stick a Google Maps pin here. We'll
always know it's here, because when we come visit

671
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:27,653
Tiberius' grave, we'll also leave some flowers and
take a mast with us.

672
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:32,391
LAURA: They've been working on this for a while
now, is it possible to wiggle my way in and check

673
01:14:32,391 --> 01:14:34,042
out the mast now?

674
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:37,306
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

675
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:45,173
LAURA: 22.

676
01:14:45,173 --> 01:14:51,109
MATT: You push past some of the Ravenite workers,
their shoulders don't give and you have to squeeze

677
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:55,554
through. As you get there, the upper part is still
locked in ice, and the lower part is locked in

678
01:14:55,554 --> 01:15:01,182
ice. For how much they've carved through already,
is the central portion, but what you can see is a

679
01:15:01,182 --> 01:15:07,813
wooden mast with large, thick bands of gold around
it that are ornamental. You can see within them

680
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:12,299
carvings and designs of a language you don't
really understand-- actually, what languages do

681
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,698
you know?

682
01:15:13,698 --> 01:15:17,097
LAURA: Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal and
Draconic.

683
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:23,173
MATT: You do not recognize this language, but it
appears to be ornamental, and that whatever ship

684
01:15:23,173 --> 01:15:33,250
this belonged to was a prized ship of either a
navy or merchant fleet. Based on some of the marks

685
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:42,773
on it, it looks like it was grabbed and broken off
a ship. Looking down below, there is a portion of

686
01:15:42,773 --> 01:15:50,110
a ship that is beneath it as well. Much deeper,
maybe another 25 feet of solid ice below you with

687
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:55,827
the rest of this hoard. There's a portion of this
ship that was dragged here by Vorugal.

688
01:15:55,827 --> 01:15:59,282
LAURA: That's crazy. It's a ship! I'm coming back
out.

689
01:15:59,282 --> 01:16:03,518
SAM: All right. Let's go back to the main group
and tell them what we've discovered.

690
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:12,605
MATT: As you're hustling your way up the ravine to
the east, you pass by a number of Ravenites coming

691
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:22,472
by with large sacks, and chunks of dragon meat
draped over them. You can see the meat itself is

692
01:16:22,472 --> 01:16:28,639
freezing the air and shoulders of those that are
carrying it. The essence of the dragon's ice-built

693
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:34,912
form is causing them to constantly shift it
because it's starting to stick to their armor, and

694
01:16:34,912 --> 01:16:38,270
you see icicles beginning to form at the outside
of these large dragon-meat haunches that they're

695
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,191
carrying.

696
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:43,073
TRAVIS: When you dry-age meat like that, salt it
first, then hang it. Just a pro tip.

697
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:47,643
MATT: (speaking Draconic). Keeps walking, doesn't
seem to understand you.

698
01:16:47,643 --> 01:16:50,655
TRAVIS: Really bad sinus problems.

699
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:57,250
MATT: Eventually you make your way back to
Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion and gather the rest

700
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:03,959
of the party. Percy, Kima, Keyleth and Vax are all
there, resting and eagerly awaiting your return.

701
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:06,894
TALIESIN: I've got to try and fix my guns.

702
01:17:06,894 --> 01:17:08,845
MATT: Okay, make some tinkering checks.

703
01:17:08,845 --> 01:17:12,263
TALIESIN: Is this a misfire check or a tinkering
check, since I'm not in combat?

704
01:17:12,263 --> 01:17:13,627
MATT: These are tinkering checks.

705
01:17:13,627 --> 01:17:25,321
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's proficiency bonus, dex roll.
Ooh, 28!

706
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,321
MATT: That's your Animus?

707
01:17:28,321 --> 01:17:30,161
TALIESIN: Yep, that's fine.

708
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:33,534
MATT: I believe Bad News was also?

709
01:17:33,534 --> 01:17:38,665
TALIESIN: Yup. 26.

710
01:17:38,665 --> 01:17:45,693
MATT: 26 is fine. You manage to get Bad News
functioning again in the workshop below. And

711
01:17:45,693 --> 01:17:46,760
Retort was okay, right?

712
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,246
TALIESIN: Yeah, Retort's fine.

713
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:50,544
MATT: So as you all return and gather around--

714
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:56,700
MARISHA: Keyleth has laid out the Vorgual spoils
like she got back from a yard sale.

715
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:04,039
MATT: Which, by the way, is a macabre view as you
walk in, and there's this smear of dark purple

716
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:12,950
dragon blood, and long, haphazardly carved chunks
of dragon hide, almost like the preset green lawn

717
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:18,538
rectangles that roll out and smeared across the
center of the foyer.

718
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:20,756
LAURA: I drop the Bag of Colding next to Keyleth.

719
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:26,062
MARISHA: Grog, can you help me see how much we can
shove in here?

720
01:18:26,062 --> 01:18:27,425
TRAVIS: Shit, yeah.

721
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:35,320
MARISHA: Here, maybe like a sleeping bag, and I'll
sit on it and you can wrap it up?

722
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,701
TRAVIS: Yeah, good deal.

723
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:39,121
MARISHA: Okay, we'll do that. Try and shove as
much as we can.

724
01:18:39,121 --> 01:18:41,185
(squishing)

725
01:18:41,185 --> 01:18:43,749
MATT: When it's finally wound up, it won't fit
within the Bag of Colding. The Bag of Colding is

726
01:18:43,749 --> 01:18:50,022
the size of a relatively large satchel. The dragon
hide, rolled up, is about that big around, what

727
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:51,132
you managed to carve off.

728
01:18:51,132 --> 01:18:52,586
LAURA: Ah, shit. What do we do?

729
01:18:52,586 --> 01:18:59,218
LIAM: Can we make Percy some dragonborn armor
right now, somehow, so he can be all white, all

730
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:00,073
over?

731
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:03,006
TALIESIN: Wow, that would be a thing, wouldn't
it?

732
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:05,561
TRAVIS: How much do you think that roll weighs?

733
01:19:05,561 --> 01:19:08,297
MATT: About 150 pounds.

734
01:19:08,297 --> 01:19:11,184
LAURA: Oh jeez. We can't carry that.

735
01:19:11,184 --> 01:19:13,727
TRAVIS: I could drag it behind me for a little
bit.

736
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:16,053
LIAM: Scanlan, do you have a room here?

737
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:17,236
SAM: A room?

738
01:19:17,236 --> 01:19:22,627
LIAM: For cold things? You have everything here,
do you have a chilly room?

739
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:28,456
SAM: Sure, in the kitchen there's a chilly room.
The mansion will expire in 12 hours though.

740
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:32,834
LAURA: We just got to go through the tree, yo.
That's it.

741
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,086
SAM: We could bring it into the kitchen for now.

742
01:19:35,086 --> 01:19:38,072
TRAVIS: Can we get everything else into the Bag of
Colding, besides the roll of hide?

743
01:19:38,072 --> 01:19:42,276
MATT: The teeth and those things can be put in the
Bag of Holding. The only thing that needs to be

744
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:43,938
preserved is the hide, until it's treated.

745
01:19:43,938 --> 01:19:45,588
LAURA: What about the blood?

746
01:19:45,588 --> 01:19:48,751
MATT: The blood's been capped. That should
probably be put in there.

747
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:51,882
MARISHA: Three vials of dragon blood in the Bag of
Colding.

748
01:19:51,882 --> 01:19:54,048
MATT: Yeah, mark three vials of white dragon blood
in the Bag of Colding.

749
01:19:54,048 --> 01:19:55,578
MARISHA: And we have six talons.

750
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:58,614
MATT: The talons themselves are large claws that
have been removed.

751
01:19:58,614 --> 01:20:02,981
MARISHA: Okay, so we have six talons, 20 teeth and
150 pounds of hide.

752
01:20:02,981 --> 01:20:04,652
MATT: There you go.

753
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:06,722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

754
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:07,851
MARISHA: Word.

755
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:16,251
TRAVIS: We got so much bling. We're stupid rich.

756
01:20:16,251 --> 01:20:18,708
SAM: A lot of things that we don't know what they
are.

757
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:20,108
LIAM: What's that mask?

758
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:26,726
TRAVIS: I take the mask, and like Jim Carrey in
The Mask, I stick it to my face and (yells).

759
01:20:26,726 --> 01:20:29,614
LIAM: Do you feel anything? What's it doing?

760
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:32,150
MATT: Okay, I need you to-- no, I'm kidding.

761
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,769
(laughter)

762
01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:38,254
MATT: It is chilly against your skin.

763
01:20:38,254 --> 01:20:43,186
TRAVIS: I feel like it's making me fall in love
with the first person I look-- Vax!

764
01:20:43,186 --> 01:20:47,012
LIAM: Oh, you don't want to fuck with this. Are
you sure?

765
01:20:47,012 --> 01:20:50,049
TRAVIS: No, you're right, I don't.

766
01:20:50,049 --> 01:20:52,934
LIAM: Maybe just a little bit.

767
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:59,539
(laughter)

768
01:20:59,539 --> 01:21:04,391
TRAVIS: I take the mask off and put it in the bag
of holding. But we got this! And I hold up the

769
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:06,779
big-ass platinum greatsword.

770
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:07,846
LIAM: Whoa.

771
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:09,981
LAURA: Can anyone identify things in our group?

772
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:16,934
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the text on it?
Celestial?

773
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:20,156
MATT: Celestial, yes, you do.

774
01:21:20,156 --> 01:21:21,862
LAURA: Oh, you can read it!

775
01:21:21,862 --> 01:21:24,455
SAM: When did you learn Celestial?

776
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:26,100
TALIESIN: I was a very lonely child.

777
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,333
LIAM: It's like Latin in the world of D&amp;D.

778
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:31,586
TRAVIS: It's like, covered with prunes, up and
down the blade.

779
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,251
LIAM: Priss, what's it say?

780
01:21:33,251 --> 01:21:35,552
LAURA: Are you calling him a priss?

781
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:38,636
LIAM: (laughing) Yeah.

782
01:21:38,636 --> 01:21:43,643
MATT: Looking across the symbols, they are
specifically symbols speaking of creation,

783
01:21:43,643 --> 01:21:53,752
devotion, the power of a deity's love and the
unity between god and creation. It is a very

784
01:21:53,752 --> 01:21:58,504
religious and holy text across the blade, both
sides.

785
01:21:58,504 --> 01:22:04,896
TALIESIN: This is some sort of paladin sword. It's
a holy weapon of some kind.

786
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:07,107
LAURA: Oh, I bet Kima would want the shit out of
that.

787
01:22:07,107 --> 01:22:08,545
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, is Kima here?

788
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:13,294
MATT: She's right now in the process, in the
kitchen, of massaging some of the bruising and

789
01:22:13,294 --> 01:22:14,669
wounds she took from the battle.

790
01:22:14,669 --> 01:22:16,230
SAM: Got some meat tenderizer on that?

791
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,615
LIAM: Couple of chickens on it?

792
01:22:18,615 --> 01:22:27,330
TRAVIS: Stop what you're doing. I want you to get
your hands on this big, beautiful bastard. And I

793
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:29,241
hand her the greatsword.

794
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:33,469
MATT: "Where the heck did you get this?"

795
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:36,957
TRAVIS: I could tell you, but I don't remember.

796
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:51,608
MATT: "Give me a little bit of time, I need to see
if I can make this part of my communion. Hold on a

797
01:22:51,608 --> 01:22:57,654
"second." And she walks away, staring at the blade.
Without leaving her eyes from the scrolling on the

798
01:22:57,654 --> 01:23:01,851
side, walks quietly past all of you in the center
of the foyer, sits down with it and starts

799
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,916
meditating over the blade.

800
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:07,761
TRAVIS: I walk over and go, "Before you hit
anything with it, you come talk to--"

801
01:23:07,761 --> 01:23:09,060
MATT: (shushing)

802
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,215
TRAVIS: I leave.

803
01:23:11,215 --> 01:23:12,633
TALIESIN: Anything else interesting?

804
01:23:12,633 --> 01:23:18,487
LAURA: I found a jewel. It's red. It looks pretty
neato.

805
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:25,075
TALIESIN: How were the dragonborn about us taking
some of their--

806
01:23:25,075 --> 01:23:28,348
LAURA: They were great about it actually, they
were quite generous.

807
01:23:28,348 --> 01:23:31,335
TALIESIN: Anything else we should go back for, as
well?

808
01:23:31,335 --> 01:23:36,504
TRAVIS: There was possibly a giant gold ship,
underneath.

809
01:23:36,504 --> 01:23:37,757
TALIESIN: There was a what?

810
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:45,202
SAM: Gold mast, underneath the hoard. And also,
much more gold and platinum that we can't possibly

811
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:46,216
carry.

812
01:23:46,216 --> 01:23:52,086
LAURA: Wait, it had runes on it as well. Do they
look similar to the runes that were on Greg--

813
01:23:52,086 --> 01:23:54,439
Grog's sword?

814
01:23:54,439 --> 01:24:03,017
MATT: No, the symbols on the side of weapon look
like an ancient text, they're laid in a very

815
01:24:03,017 --> 01:24:09,378
ceremonial format. The text that you saw on the
side of the mast looked more like an engraving.

816
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:12,188
LAURA: Did it look fluid?

817
01:24:12,188 --> 01:24:13,109
MATT: It was fluid.

818
01:24:13,109 --> 01:24:17,057
TALIESIN: There's a ship in the dragon's
collection?

819
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:20,909
LAURA: Yes. I don't know if it was an entire ship,
but it was a ship.

820
01:24:20,909 --> 01:24:23,479
LIAM: So you didn't go in, you saw it?

821
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,724
LAURA: Well I got down, but most of it was still
frozen.

822
01:24:25,724 --> 01:24:32,217
TALIESIN: I think this would be a really good
idea, before we left. If a dragon grabbed a ship,

823
01:24:32,217 --> 01:24:39,249
it was probably filled with something interesting.
It got his attention and he kept it.

824
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:45,179
MARISHA: It could take days to potentially melt
the ice, right?

825
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:46,491
TALIESIN: The ice is already melting.

826
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:49,846
LIAM: Keek, you could probably melt your way in
there in 24 hours.

827
01:24:49,846 --> 01:24:55,071
MARISHA: And I also have this. My new toy.

828
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:58,839
LAURA: We should check that out before we go.

829
01:24:58,839 --> 01:25:05,461
SAM: Are we in any danger staying here, leaving
our special hidey place unprotected?

830
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:08,031
TALIESIN: It's not like anyone can get in here.

831
01:25:08,031 --> 01:25:13,122
SAM: No, I'm talking about your homeland. Leaving
it unguarded.

832
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:15,898
TALIESIN: It's as guarded as it's going to be
right now.

833
01:25:15,898 --> 01:25:18,422
SAM: We know that Raishan's out there, doing
something.

834
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:24,263
TALIESIN: She was doing something previously. I
don't think that anything awful is going to

835
01:25:24,263 --> 01:25:25,387
happen.

836
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,784
TRAVIS: I also took this little keepsake. I call
it Stoneblack.

837
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:30,629
SAM: Because it's a black stone?

838
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:33,468
TRAVIS: Well don't fucking break it down like
that.

839
01:25:33,468 --> 01:25:34,858
LAURA: It's so neat.

840
01:25:34,858 --> 01:25:37,556
MARISHA: Does it look fancy? Is it magic?

841
01:25:37,556 --> 01:25:41,524
SAM: Why don't you Detect Magic, whoever can
Detect Magic?

842
01:25:41,524 --> 01:25:44,591
MARISHA: I can't. Wait, can I? No, I can't.

843
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:47,877
SAM: I can look at it and see if it looks magical.

844
01:25:47,877 --> 01:25:50,746
MATT: Yeah, make an arcana check.

845
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,595
SAM: Ooh, 20!

846
01:25:53,595 --> 01:26:01,189
MATT: It is not magical. However, your keen bardic
eye, looking at the gem, it is a very rare gem. It

847
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,582
is worth quite a bit.

848
01:26:03,582 --> 01:26:07,928
SAM: Platinum zirconia.

849
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:15,779
MATT: It's actually a black sapphire, an extremely
rare gem. It runs in the market anywhere between

850
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:18,188
four to six thousand gold.

851
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:23,037
TRAVIS: So anyway, I got rid of my old saltlick
rock and now I've got Stoneblack here to take its

852
01:26:23,037 --> 01:26:25,677
place. Do you have a pet rock?

853
01:26:25,677 --> 01:26:26,711
SAM: No.

854
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:29,829
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I sleep with it, I put it under
my back and it gets all the knots out.

855
01:26:29,829 --> 01:26:31,410
LIAM: That is the cutest.

856
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:34,384
SAM: Do you paint a face on it, or anything?

857
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:37,953
MARISHA: I've actually had a lot of rocks that are
friends.

858
01:26:37,953 --> 01:26:40,297
LAURA: Oh, that's great. You can make little
clothes for it.

859
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:42,517
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't have a lot of friends
growing up.

860
01:26:42,517 --> 01:26:46,827
TRAVIS: Sometimes I carry it in my armpit to keep
it warm. You don't need to know about that.

861
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,165
SAM: That's very maternal.

862
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:49,447
LAURA: Oh, and these boots!

863
01:26:49,447 --> 01:26:52,149
SAM: Leather boots, could be anything.

864
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:54,226
LAURA: Are they magic, Scanlan?

865
01:26:54,226 --> 01:27:03,636
SAM: Oh sure, I'll look at those. Wow, 24! Arcana
check, yeah?

866
01:27:03,636 --> 01:27:10,598
MATT: Yeah. They're very simple leather boots,
there's no real ornamentation beyond being

867
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:15,551
functional boots. As you take a moment to look at
them, there is a faint shimmer to the leather

868
01:27:15,551 --> 01:27:22,316
itself. When the light hits it, the brown gives
way to a slight purplish undertone. It looks to

869
01:27:22,316 --> 01:27:23,971
have some sort of enchantment.

870
01:27:23,971 --> 01:27:25,836
LAURA: Does it seem evil or good?

871
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:29,512
SAM: I have no idea. However, they look fancy.

872
01:27:29,512 --> 01:27:32,276
TALIESIN: They are interesting, and I'm
indifferent to such things.

873
01:27:32,276 --> 01:27:36,219
LAURA: I want to put one on.

874
01:27:36,219 --> 01:27:38,628
SAM: Go ahead, put one on, what could happen?
We're in a safe place.

875
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,769
LAURA: I just want to see what it does.

876
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:43,526
SAM: Wait, what if it's single use only?

877
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,740
TRAVIS: Well, now's a good time.

878
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,994
LAURA: Oh no.

879
01:27:46,994 --> 01:27:51,514
SAM: It's a boot, it's probably made for multiple
uses.

880
01:27:51,514 --> 01:27:54,782
MATT: You can take a short rest and take time with
the item to figure out what it could do, if you

881
01:27:54,782 --> 01:27:55,855
want to.

882
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:59,953
MARISHA: I attune to my staff.

883
01:27:59,953 --> 01:28:04,105
MATT: Okay, so you attune to your staff. What are
you unattuning from?

884
01:28:04,105 --> 01:28:06,059
MARISHA: Currently my Ring of Protection.

885
01:28:06,059 --> 01:28:08,592
LAURA: Oh, that's painful.

886
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:12,016
SAM: AC down!

887
01:28:12,016 --> 01:28:16,399
MATT: So all your saves are down by two, your AC
is down by two, for now. Good to know.

888
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:20,939
SAM: By the way, we have two unused Ring of
Protections that we can trade for things. I have

889
01:28:20,939 --> 01:28:23,352
one that I haven't used in months.

890
01:28:23,352 --> 01:28:29,963
MATT: Like Stone of Jordans now. It's the thing
you trade. Props to you if you know what that

891
01:28:29,963 --> 01:28:36,087
reference was. What do you guys want to do? Do you
want to take a short rest to try and figure things out?

892
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:37,870
ALL: Sure.

893
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:42,257
MATT: Kima's focusing on the sword, you're
focusing on the boots.

894
01:28:42,257 --> 01:28:44,365
TRAVIS: I'm focusing on the war mask.

895
01:28:44,365 --> 01:28:46,949
MATT: Who else is doing what?

896
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:48,147
TALIESIN: Is there other things?

897
01:28:48,147 --> 01:28:52,233
LAURA: Here's a beautiful red gem. It looks
special.

898
01:28:52,233 --> 01:28:55,451
TALIESIN: Does this actually look like a special
gem?

899
01:28:55,451 --> 01:28:57,204
MATT: Which gem is this?

900
01:28:57,204 --> 01:29:00,691
LAURA: The red beautiful gem you told me about.

901
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:02,075
MATT: Oh, the ruby. It looks very pretty.

902
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:07,031
SAM: I've got a vial with yellow and black swirly
stuff in it.

903
01:29:07,031 --> 01:29:09,652
TALIESIN: That requires somebody who knows
things.

904
01:29:09,652 --> 01:29:11,066
SAM: I'll look at that.

905
01:29:11,066 --> 01:29:15,482
MARISHA: Can I do a check on the potion since I've
got alchemy training?

906
01:29:15,482 --> 01:29:18,805
MATT: You know what? Yeah, if you wanted to take a
look.

907
01:29:18,805 --> 01:29:21,769
TALIESIN: There's some bracelets and such, I
thought I'd take a look.

908
01:29:21,769 --> 01:29:24,339
SAM: I have a gold and platinum band with braids.

909
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:28,570
TALIESIN: Ah, I'll take a look at the
back-blades.

910
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,978
SAM: The back-blades. That's nice.

911
01:29:30,978 --> 01:29:34,065
MATT: So Keyleth was taking a look at the
potions?

912
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:38,520
LAURA: What about the bracelet, you also had a
bracelet with a sapphire?

913
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,808
SAM: I just gave it to back-blades over here.

914
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:43,655
LAURA: No, you had a ring and you had a bracelet.

915
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:49,263
SAM: I have a platinum bracelet which I assumed
was just fancy and pretty. Here, look at that one

916
01:29:49,263 --> 01:29:50,550
too, Percy.

917
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:55,969
TALIESIN: I think I can only handle one of these,
but we'll find out what happens.

918
01:29:55,969 --> 01:30:04,240
MATT: All right, so as you guys make a short rest.
Keyleth, you identify both potions, one of which

919
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,809
is a Potion of Speed.

920
01:30:05,809 --> 01:30:09,513
MARISHA: That's what I thought it was. The yellow
one?

921
01:30:09,584 --> 01:30:13,589
MATT: Yep. The other is a Potion of
Invulnerability.

922
01:30:13,589 --> 01:30:26,262
SAM: What does it do? Read it! Out loud, with your
mouth.

923
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:33,307
MARISHA: For one minute after you drink this
potion, you have resistance to all damage.

924
01:30:33,307 --> 01:30:34,598
LIAM: God-mode!

925
01:30:34,598 --> 01:30:37,907
MARISHA: The potion's syrupy liquid looks like
liquefied iron.

926
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:39,343
TRAVIS: So you half all damage.

927
01:30:39,343 --> 01:30:40,936
MATT: Half all damage for a minute.

928
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:45,892
LAURA: That is so insane.

929
01:30:45,892 --> 01:30:48,933
MARISHA: And then Potion of Speed: when you drink
this potion, you gain the effects of Haste spell

930
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:50,386
for one minute.

931
01:30:50,386 --> 01:30:53,060
LAURA: I'm putting that in the party inventory.

932
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:58,007
SAM: No, no, no. Hand it out to somebody. Oh, that
one should go in the party inventory.

933
01:30:58,007 --> 01:30:59,995
MARISHA: Which one, the Potion of Speed?

934
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:02,554
LAURA: The Potion of Invulnerability, so we can
decide later.

935
01:31:02,554 --> 01:31:04,262
LIAM: That's for a very special day.

936
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:06,201
SAM: Grog could take the speed.

937
01:31:06,201 --> 01:31:07,722
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want to take the speed
potion, Grog?

938
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:09,129
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, I won't use it.

939
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:12,667
MARISHA: Give the invulnerability to Laura.

940
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,139
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

941
01:31:14,139 --> 01:31:18,460
MATT: All right, the boots. To you, Vex.

942
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:22,343
TALIESIN: So many things.

943
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:31,253
LAURA: Is it Boots of Haste? (yells) Oh my god,
this is so crazy, because I was about to learn a

944
01:31:31,253 --> 01:31:41,462
spell, for somebody, but these take care of that.
These are Boots of Feral Leaping. When you wear

945
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:47,723
these boots you can instill your leaps with
incredible bursts of power! As a bonus action you

946
01:31:47,723 --> 01:31:52,438
can attempt to leap. Make a strength check with a
DC of 16. If you are successful you leap either 15

947
01:31:52,438 --> 01:31:54,523
feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally.

948
01:31:54,523 --> 01:31:56,627
SAM: (meowing)

949
01:31:56,627 --> 01:31:58,208
TRAVIS: Do you have to attune to them?

950
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:00,013
LAURA: It doesn't say!

951
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:02,066
MATT: Yeah, those aren't attunement.

952
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:04,616
(cheering)

953
01:32:04,616 --> 01:32:06,770
LAURA: There you go Grog. You need those.

954
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:12,004
TRAVIS: Does anyone want the Potion of Speed? I
don't want it to be just my Christmas. That's

955
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:13,340
amazing!

956
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,880
SAM: Anyone need the Potion of Speed?

957
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,906
MATT: If you fail the check though, you fall prone
where you stand.

958
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:20,019
LAURA: Oh, that's important.

959
01:32:20,019 --> 01:32:23,697
MATT: Strength check, so you'll probably be okay.

960
01:32:23,697 --> 01:32:25,619
LIAM: Most of the time, but once in awhile--

961
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:28,887
MATT: Once in a while banana peel.

962
01:32:28,887 --> 01:32:32,822
LAURA: I have a question, because the spell that I
was going to take, because I still have one spell

963
01:32:32,822 --> 01:32:42,631
that I haven't learned yet, is Jump, which triples
your jump for one minute. So if I did that, would

964
01:32:42,631 --> 01:32:47,429
that triple that as well? Or would it just be
Grog's normal jump?

965
01:32:47,429 --> 01:32:54,492
MATT: That magic would override the spell, based
on the enchantment. It's two different magical

966
01:32:54,492 --> 01:33:00,121
forces affecting the same thing. The Jump spell is
part of the enchantment that boot was crafted

967
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:01,134
around.

968
01:33:01,134 --> 01:33:02,338
LAURA: Oh, so that's perfect.

969
01:33:02,338 --> 01:33:06,124
MATT: The platinum band is not magical.

970
01:33:06,124 --> 01:33:07,793
TALIESIN: Yay!

971
01:33:07,793 --> 01:33:16,014
MATT: But it is worth quite a bit, actually. The
platinum band is worth about 2500 gold.

972
01:33:16,014 --> 01:33:18,568
TALIESIN: That's a magic all its own.

973
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:20,804
MATT: And the ring, who had the ring?

974
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:24,078
SAM: I have a platinum bracelet?

975
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:27,292
MATT: The platinum bracelet was what he looked at
right now. That's worth 2500.

976
01:33:27,292 --> 01:33:33,667
SAM: Oh wait, the gold platinum band? The band was
a ring? Got it.

977
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:36,952
MATT: You have the ring?

978
01:33:36,952 --> 01:33:41,840
SAM: Yes I do. Oh, it's a thing! I'm stuck here.
Oh god.

979
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:49,521
TRAVIS: The cube shrinks to half its size.

980
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:51,038
LIAM: A centimeter.

981
01:33:51,038 --> 01:33:59,197
SAM: It's a Ring of Invisibility. While wearing
this ring you can turn invisible as an action.

982
01:33:59,197 --> 01:34:03,533
Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible
with you. You remain invisible until the ring is

983
01:34:03,533 --> 01:34:11,423
removed, until you attack or cast a spell or until
you get Backblaze. I don't need this.

984
01:34:11,423 --> 01:34:13,304
LIAM: Does it say attunement on it?

985
01:34:13,304 --> 01:34:25,517
MATT: It does require attunement. It's a legendary
item, meaning it's extremely rare. You know how

986
01:34:25,517 --> 01:34:29,940
you use a spell, and once you do something the
spell's gone? That, while you're wearing it-- you

987
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:35,888
can turn back invisible for another action. As many
times as you want, for as long as you wear it. So

988
01:34:35,888 --> 01:34:41,044
situationally, it can be very useful, if you're
trying to do infiltration or something.

989
01:34:41,044 --> 01:34:45,892
SAM: You can pop out, cast a spell and pop back.
But not a bonus action.

990
01:34:45,892 --> 01:34:51,846
MATT: No. It's less of a combat benefit,
necessarily, in some situations it may be.

991
01:34:51,846 --> 01:34:57,375
LIAM: Like going to a white dragon lair.

992
01:34:57,375 --> 01:35:00,629
MARISHA: Who wants to keep it?

993
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:02,220
LAURA: Stealthy people need it, probably.

994
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:03,595
MATT: Kima is happy.

995
01:35:03,595 --> 01:35:04,665
TRAVIS: Kima is happy?

996
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:05,634
MATT: Kima is very happy.

997
01:35:05,634 --> 01:35:06,911
MARISHA: What'd she get?

998
01:35:06,911 --> 01:35:09,420
LAURA: Did you just give away something amazing?

999
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:12,769
SAM: We can always take it back.

1000
01:35:12,769 --> 01:35:16,963
MATT: As she stands up she takes the blade and
swings it. It hits the ground, and when she hits

1001
01:35:16,963 --> 01:35:25,445
you can see a spark of divine energy from the
impact. She looks at her maul and goes, "Sorry, old

1002
01:35:25,445 --> 01:35:34,066
"friend. You'll find a good new home. But I'd say
this Holy Avenger is going to do me quite well."

1003
01:35:34,066 --> 01:35:36,662
MARISHA: What's it do, Kima?

1004
01:35:36,662 --> 01:35:40,654
MATT: To give you specifics, it requires
attunement by a paladin.

1005
01:35:40,654 --> 01:35:42,959
LAURA: Oh, so it has to be a paladin.

1006
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:48,348
MATT: Only really Vax or her could attune to it.
It's plus three bonus to attack and damage rolls.

1007
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:56,902
Hitting a fiend or undead, the creature takes an
additional 2d10 radiant damage on every hit. While

1008
01:35:56,902 --> 01:36:00,854
you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a
10ft radius around you. You and all creatures

1009
01:36:00,854 --> 01:36:04,770
friendly to you in the aura have advantage on
saving throws against spells and magical effects.

1010
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:08,715
TRAVIS: Kima is now an associate member of Vox
Machina.

1011
01:36:08,715 --> 01:36:11,466
SAM: Provisional.

1012
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:19,216
TRAVIS: Provisional, yeah. That's amazing. So the
maul-- Kima, because I want to respect your

1013
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:21,684
weapon, what does the maul do?

1014
01:36:21,684 --> 01:36:27,313
MATT: "Oh, you want the maul?"

1015
01:36:27,313 --> 01:36:30,949
TRAVIS: What? No, I'm just saying, what it does,
or does it just beat the shit out of people

1016
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:32,469
beautifully by itself?

1017
01:36:32,469 --> 01:36:44,798
MATT: "It's my Holy Thunder Maul. It deals
additional thunder damage when I hit something.

1018
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:47,797
"That's about it."

1019
01:36:47,797 --> 01:36:50,254
TRAVIS: Cool. You want me to hold onto it for you,
or are you cool?

1020
01:36:50,254 --> 01:36:56,140
MATT: (thunk) I'm good for now.

1021
01:36:56,140 --> 01:37:00,264
TRAVIS: Boss. Total boss moment.

1022
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:02,953
LAURA: She can do 100 push-ups.

1023
01:37:02,953 --> 01:37:05,368
TRAVIS: That's true. Enjoy that.

1024
01:37:05,368 --> 01:37:07,236
MATT: "Oh, I shall."

1025
01:37:07,236 --> 01:37:12,407
MARISHA: I run downstairs to the training area
with my staff.

1026
01:37:12,407 --> 01:37:14,845
TRAVIS: Anything from the war mask?

1027
01:37:14,845 --> 01:37:19,019
MATT: No, but it is worth 750 gold.

1028
01:37:19,019 --> 01:37:20,959
LAURA: Whoa.

1029
01:37:20,959 --> 01:37:24,686
TRAVIS: I'll unlock its secrets. Wear him down.

1030
01:37:24,686 --> 01:37:29,322
SAM: Well, if we're ever invited to a Masqueradé--
is that how you say it?

1031
01:37:29,322 --> 01:37:31,082
MATT: No, but continue please.

1032
01:37:31,082 --> 01:37:36,587
TALIESIN: Paper faces on paradé.

1033
01:37:36,587 --> 01:37:38,457
TRAVIS: Can I get a description of it?

1034
01:37:38,457 --> 01:37:46,879
MATT: Yeah, it resembles the Maori warrior masks
with the big open mouth, the tongue sticking out,

1035
01:37:46,879 --> 01:37:52,601
the two pronged teeth coming up from underneath.
It's a war mask, it's meant to inspire fear and

1036
01:37:52,601 --> 01:37:57,078
give you an ominous presence on the battlefield.

1037
01:37:57,078 --> 01:37:58,482
SAM: Is it platinum?

1038
01:37:58,482 --> 01:38:00,603
MATT: It's gold. Old, very old.

1039
01:38:00,603 --> 01:38:02,102
SAM: Does it go with his hat?

1040
01:38:02,102 --> 01:38:06,321
MATT: If you were to attach it some way, it would
look very interesting.

1041
01:38:06,321 --> 01:38:09,175
TALIESIN: Would you like me to attach the mask to
your fine hat?

1042
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:11,307
LIAM: To the back of his head.

1043
01:38:11,307 --> 01:38:12,992
LAURA: Ooh, to the back of it.

1044
01:38:12,992 --> 01:38:16,345
LIAM: So they don't know if he's going or coming.

1045
01:38:16,345 --> 01:38:18,677
TALIESIN: All right, bring it downstairs.

1046
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:23,368
MARISHA: They're both metal, right? I can help you
by heating metal, actually.

1047
01:38:23,368 --> 01:38:25,060
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just do this.

1048
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,773
TRAVIS: Can you also put my title on the inside?

1049
01:38:27,773 --> 01:38:29,062
TALIESIN: Your what?

1050
01:38:29,062 --> 01:38:30,173
TRAVIS: My title.

1051
01:38:30,173 --> 01:38:31,288
TALIESIN: Oh yes, of course.

1052
01:38:31,288 --> 01:38:38,142
MARISHA: I'm going to go test this out, and I'll
meet you in the workshop. I'll be right back.

1053
01:38:38,142 --> 01:38:39,927
TRAVIS: Wait! Are you going downstairs?

1054
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:41,859
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to see what this does.

1055
01:38:41,859 --> 01:38:43,077
TRAVIS: Can I come with you?

1056
01:38:43,077 --> 01:38:44,379
TALIESIN: We're all going downstairs.

1057
01:38:44,379 --> 01:38:46,180
MARISHA: It's a free mansion, man.

1058
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:48,565
LIAM: You want to have a drink with me?

1059
01:38:48,565 --> 01:38:49,871
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

1060
01:38:49,871 --> 01:38:56,856
MATT: So while you guys go downstairs, you two are
going to the dining area?

1061
01:38:56,856 --> 01:38:59,984
LAURA: Is there a lounge in the mansion, is there
a bar?

1062
01:38:59,984 --> 01:39:02,635
SAM: There's <i>mostly</i> lounges in the mansion.

1063
01:39:02,635 --> 01:39:05,738
LIAM: Is there an aerated wine cellar?

1064
01:39:05,738 --> 01:39:09,937
(laughter)

1065
01:39:09,937 --> 01:39:11,869
SAM: It's constantly aerating.

1066
01:39:11,869 --> 01:39:17,765
(swirling)

1067
01:39:17,765 --> 01:39:28,450
SAM: Inside joke. I'm being teased right now for
owning and using a wine aerator.

1068
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:33,531
TRAVIS: Whoever sold you that and said it was an
aerator is laughing their happy asses off.

1069
01:39:33,531 --> 01:39:38,728
SAM: I appreciate fine things, and I'm not going
to apologize for that.

1070
01:39:38,728 --> 01:39:42,237
TRAVIS: Some guy broke that off of his kid's toys
and was like "It's an aerator!"

1071
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:48,249
LAURA: So yes, that's where we'll go. We're going
to go to the wine room.

1072
01:39:48,249 --> 01:39:50,732
MATT: All right, you guys find your way to the
wine room. Scanlan, what are you doing?

1073
01:39:50,732 --> 01:39:57,898
SAM: A whole lot of nothing. I'll go down and
watch the show, I guess. I'll watch the training show.

1074
01:39:57,898 --> 01:40:01,878
MATT: All right, you four head down to the
training room. Kima comes down to watch as well.

1075
01:40:01,878 --> 01:40:07,521
Pike comes down, eager to watch what this new
artifact does. You head down to the training area.

1076
01:40:07,521 --> 01:40:12,470
You have the big sandpit that's cordoned off with
the wooden outskirts, you have the various dummies

1077
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:18,773
set up in certain ways, you have the portion of
the room that has the armor stand on the side, the

1078
01:40:18,773 --> 01:40:21,001
weapon stand. What do you want to do?

1079
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:31,907
MARISHA: Ooh-hoo. Okay. All right. Everyone stay
back. I'm going to start by casting the lowest

1080
01:40:31,907 --> 01:40:34,130
level of spell out of it, see what it does.

1081
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,597
MATT: Which is?

1082
01:40:35,597 --> 01:40:38,525
MARISHA: Apparently a Fireball.

1083
01:40:38,525 --> 01:40:40,508
MATT: Okay. At where?

1084
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:46,147
MARISHA: Whatever is further in the sandpit. I
told everyone to stand back.

1085
01:40:46,147 --> 01:40:50,659
MATT: Everyone stays back. Furthest part of the
sandpit is going to be one of the various combat

1086
01:40:50,659 --> 01:40:56,629
dummies. So you launch-- put the staff down, you
guys watch as in the centerpiece at the top, where

1087
01:40:56,629 --> 01:41:01,662
that one gem is hovering and slowly rotating in
place, the gem begins to glow bright red from its

1088
01:41:01,662 --> 01:41:09,102
soft bluish-green composure. As it hits bright
red, this beam of familiar red arcane energy

1089
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:15,561
streaks forward, hits it and detonates into a
shaking explosion, destroying the wooden dummy and

1090
01:41:15,561 --> 01:41:18,118
singeing the one immediately left to it.

1091
01:41:18,118 --> 01:41:20,953
TRAVIS: Whoa. Cool.

1092
01:41:20,953 --> 01:41:22,015
MARISHA: Did you see that, Grog?

1093
01:41:22,015 --> 01:41:23,214
TRAVIS: Yeah. Really nice.

1094
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:24,242
MARISHA: That was awesome.

1095
01:41:24,242 --> 01:41:26,183
TRAVIS: Was that the biggest thing it does?

1096
01:41:26,183 --> 01:41:28,586
MATT: So that's three charges off.

1097
01:41:28,586 --> 01:41:32,739
LAURA: How many charges are there?

1098
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:40,374
MARISHA: 20, and they recharge at the top of a
day. They recharge 1d6 plus four.

1099
01:41:40,374 --> 01:41:42,600
LAURA: Oh. How many recharge a day?

1100
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,525
MARISHA: 1d6 plus four.

1101
01:41:44,525 --> 01:41:48,338
TRAVIS: So five to ten. Five to eleven.

1102
01:41:48,338 --> 01:41:55,229
MARISHA: Because I've been really excited about
this one, I'm going to point at the other dummy and

1103
01:41:55,229 --> 01:41:59,011
cast Chain Lightning.

1104
01:41:59,011 --> 01:42:03,667
MATT: Okay. As you do, you watch as this giant
bolt of electrical energy arcs off the same place

1105
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:09,477
on the staff, hits the dummy and the dummy
immediately bursts into flames from the energy

1106
01:42:09,477 --> 01:42:13,577
hitting the wood, and then arcs off and hits the
two others. Suddenly the dummies are partially

1107
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:20,254
blown apart on one side, the charred section
slowly smoldering as smoke pours up, and you can

1108
01:42:20,254 --> 01:42:24,338
see bits of the electrical energy going
(crackling) through the remainder of the wooden

1109
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:25,461
dummy.

1110
01:42:25,461 --> 01:42:26,724
MARISHA: Grog. Did you see that?

1111
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:29,544
TRAVIS: Holy shit. That was amazing. I kind of
want to get out there for whatever you do next.

1112
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:30,629
MARISHA: Really?

1113
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:35,660
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to see how much damage it does.
Wait, can you use this in Minxie form too?

1114
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:38,765
MARISHA: Hmm, I don't think so.

1115
01:42:38,765 --> 01:42:41,688
TRAVIS: No, you think so, or you don't?

1116
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:48,510
MARISHA: I can try this though! Hang on, wait,
that was five charges. No sorry, six charges.

1117
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:51,928
Burning through all the charges, but I don't care.

1118
01:42:51,928 --> 01:42:54,713
TRAVIS: Do you have another one you want to do?

1119
01:42:54,713 --> 01:42:58,437
MARISHA: Watch this Grog, watch this. I'm going to
do Conjure Elemental.

1120
01:42:58,437 --> 01:43:01,025
MATT: Okay, and which elemental are you going to
conjure?

1121
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:03,506
MARISHA: What elemental?

1122
01:43:03,506 --> 01:43:04,971
TRAVIS: Earth, big!

1123
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:06,025
MARISHA: Earth!

1124
01:43:06,025 --> 01:43:16,247
MATT: You watch as she slams the staff in the
ground and you feel this quaking, and the sandpit

1125
01:43:16,247 --> 01:43:23,340
behind her begins to slowly billow and rise up. As
the sand falls away from underneath, you see,

1126
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:30,377
standing behind and looming over Keyleth, this
giant, cracked stone earth elemental, very much

1127
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:35,367
like the form she often takes, standing behind
her. Its eyes flash up with a bright green glow

1128
01:43:35,367 --> 01:43:37,972
and it sits there, awaiting her command.

1129
01:43:37,972 --> 01:43:42,822
MARISHA: Then I do a bonus action and I also turn
into an earth elemental.

1130
01:43:42,822 --> 01:43:44,470
MATT: That's right, because you got your forms
back at a short rest.

1131
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,419
MARISHA: Yes I did.

1132
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:48,377
MATT: So now she turns into the same form. There's
now two elementals there.

1133
01:43:48,377 --> 01:43:49,430
SAM: Fight, fight, fight!

1134
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,231
MARISHA: Then we walk by and we Top Gun each
other.

1135
01:43:51,231 --> 01:43:58,698
MATT: Each slam itself causes the air around to
(cracking) like a small thunderwave in its own right.

1136
01:43:58,698 --> 01:44:01,436
MARISHA: Then we both turn and look at Grog.

1137
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:05,900
TRAVIS: That was <i>amazing</i>.

1138
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,750
MARISHA: Then I punch Grog in the face!

1139
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,031
LIAM: Yes!

1140
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:11,179
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

1141
01:44:11,179 --> 01:44:14,363
MARISHA: Natural one!

1142
01:44:14,363 --> 01:44:18,299
TALIESIN: That's not a spell attack, is it?

1143
01:44:18,299 --> 01:44:19,697
MARISHA: That was for me!

1144
01:44:19,697 --> 01:44:26,048
MATT: And for the other elemental, what's your
bonus? As an earth elemental, what's your attack

1145
01:44:26,048 --> 01:44:28,777
bonus? Because the other elemental is going to
punch him at the same time too.

1146
01:44:28,777 --> 01:44:31,115
MARISHA: He gets a plus eight.

1147
01:44:31,115 --> 01:44:35,502
MATT: Plus eight? That's a 16, that does not. So
here's what happens. In slow motion, Grog stands

1148
01:44:35,502 --> 01:44:43,202
there with a big grin on his face, and both fists
go (slamming) and glide off, no impact. And you're

1149
01:44:43,202 --> 01:44:45,525
still dumbfounded and enjoying the moment.

1150
01:44:45,525 --> 01:44:46,669
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

1151
01:44:46,669 --> 01:44:49,381
MARISHA: (gruffly) I did that on purpose.

1152
01:44:49,381 --> 01:44:51,301
TRAVIS: Can I understand what she's saying?

1153
01:44:51,301 --> 01:44:53,402
MATT: No, you hear (rockslide crashing).

1154
01:44:53,402 --> 01:44:56,954
SAM: Wow, she can become far-sighted earth
elementals.

1155
01:44:56,954 --> 01:45:01,623
(laughter)

1156
01:45:01,623 --> 01:45:03,968
SAM: Amazing.

1157
01:45:03,968 --> 01:45:07,066
MARISHA: Okay, I drop my form to hear what Grog
has to say.

1158
01:45:07,066 --> 01:45:12,858
TRAVIS: That sucked. That was the worst one of all
of them.

1159
01:45:12,858 --> 01:45:14,101
MARISHA: Really?

1160
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:14,944
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1161
01:45:14,944 --> 01:45:16,201
MARISHA: Did it hurt you when we punched you?

1162
01:45:16,201 --> 01:45:18,505
TRAVIS: No, like-- wait, is the beard all right?

1163
01:45:18,505 --> 01:45:21,371
MATT: The beard is fine.

1164
01:45:21,371 --> 01:45:25,877
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, no. It's all good. Does it do
anything else than whiff?

1165
01:45:25,877 --> 01:45:30,379
MARISHA: Well. And I tell the elemental to--

1166
01:45:30,379 --> 01:45:37,113
TALIESIN: No, it does nothing else.

1167
01:45:37,113 --> 01:45:38,354
LAURA: Nothing.

1168
01:45:38,354 --> 01:45:40,121
MARISHA: Attack Grog again.

1169
01:45:40,121 --> 01:45:42,093
TRAVIS: Let me turn around.

1170
01:45:42,093 --> 01:45:45,713
MATT: That is an 18.

1171
01:45:45,713 --> 01:45:48,973
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

1172
01:45:48,973 --> 01:45:55,268
MATT: It doesn't miss, what it does is it hits you
and you're like (slamming). You barely felt it.

1173
01:45:55,268 --> 01:45:56,537
MARISHA: How was that?

1174
01:45:56,537 --> 01:46:00,636
TRAVIS: Oh man, yeah. Really, whew. Stout.

1175
01:46:00,636 --> 01:46:02,072
MARISHA: Really? Yeah?

1176
01:46:02,072 --> 01:46:04,889
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm questioning my faith now.

1177
01:46:04,889 --> 01:46:07,275
MARISHA: Man, this staff is so powerful.

1178
01:46:07,275 --> 01:46:08,509
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure is.

1179
01:46:08,509 --> 01:46:09,759
MARISHA: Jeez, wow.

1180
01:46:09,759 --> 01:46:19,410
TRAVIS: Not that I want to feel any more damage
after that hurricane of pain, but does it do

1181
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:20,730
<i>anything</i> else?

1182
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:23,626
MARISHA: I can keep burning the fucking charges.

1183
01:46:23,626 --> 01:46:26,813
MATT: By the way, you've now burned 14 charges.

1184
01:46:26,813 --> 01:46:28,431
MARISHA: Yes, I know.

1185
01:46:28,431 --> 01:46:29,852
TRAVIS: Give me one really big one.

1186
01:46:29,852 --> 01:46:33,419
MARISHA: Goddamn it. I hope we're not fighting
anything so I can recharge these.

1187
01:46:33,419 --> 01:46:36,478
LAURA: It's going to be like three days for her to
get them back.

1188
01:46:36,478 --> 01:46:40,068
SAM: Does this thing protect you at all?

1189
01:46:40,068 --> 01:46:44,343
MARISHA: No, it's a damage-dealer.

1190
01:46:44,343 --> 01:46:50,462
LAURA: Don't do any more. Don't waste any more,
Marisha. Don't do it.

1191
01:46:50,462 --> 01:46:51,715
LIAM: You're not there.

1192
01:46:51,715 --> 01:46:53,484
LAURA: That's why I said Marisha.

1193
01:46:53,484 --> 01:47:03,275
MARISHA: I'm going to wait. I'm going to see. I'm
going to save some action. Real fast, just in

1194
01:47:03,275 --> 01:47:05,912
case-- and I whack him with the staff.

1195
01:47:05,912 --> 01:47:07,439
TRAVIS: Like Rafiki?

1196
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:15,167
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a d20. Add your
strength modifier and your proficiency modifier.

1197
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:25,550
MARISHA: My strength and my-- Let's see, 18. No
wait, 19!

1198
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,105
MATT: 19. What's your AC, Grog?

1199
01:47:27,105 --> 01:47:28,138
TRAVIS: 20.

1200
01:47:28,138 --> 01:47:29,775
ALL: Aww.

1201
01:47:29,775 --> 01:47:30,772
MATT: Whack!

1202
01:47:30,772 --> 01:47:45,072
TRAVIS: (melodramatic groaning) Oh, the pain of--
what's this thing called? Confires! It hurts so much.

1203
01:47:45,072 --> 01:47:47,378
MARISHA: Wow, really?

1204
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:50,876
TRAVIS: I feel the reflux-- the conflux.

1205
01:47:50,876 --> 01:47:53,153
MARISHA: Oh, it gave you acid reflux?

1206
01:47:53,153 --> 01:47:56,372
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's real bad. I have to leave
because I feel like I might toss.

1207
01:47:56,372 --> 01:47:58,949
MARISHA: That's good to know. It induces
sickness?

1208
01:47:58,949 --> 01:48:01,375
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like I'm going to cry too.

1209
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:04,123
MARISHA: Okay, good to know, all right, thank
you.

1210
01:48:04,123 --> 01:48:07,605
TRAVIS: And I leave, holding my forehead and
laughing. Small, little laugh.

1211
01:48:07,605 --> 01:48:09,743
MARISHA: I'm good for now.

1212
01:48:09,743 --> 01:48:11,772
MATT: Percy, you're going to the workshop, you
said?

1213
01:48:11,772 --> 01:48:15,132
TALIESIN: Yeah, grabbing the helmets and here, I'm
going to borrow you.

1214
01:48:15,132 --> 01:48:16,388
MARISHA: And now I go.

1215
01:48:16,388 --> 01:48:20,567
MATT: So you guys go and do that. In the meantime,
both of you find your way to Scanlan's wine room.

1216
01:48:20,567 --> 01:48:28,393
(aerating noises and laughter)

1217
01:48:28,393 --> 01:48:32,184
LIAM: I don't know what any of these are; do you
know what's good and what's bad?

1218
01:48:32,184 --> 01:48:33,903
LAURA: Pick the one that looks the fanciest.

1219
01:48:33,903 --> 01:48:36,153
LIAM: You were better at that than I am.

1220
01:48:36,153 --> 01:48:43,874
LAURA: I go to the corner-- the highest shelf, I
don't fucking know. These are probably all fake

1221
01:48:43,874 --> 01:48:47,762
wine anyway. I fly up and grab the one on the
highest shelf and fly back down.

1222
01:48:47,762 --> 01:48:57,055
MATT: You grab it, look at the label. It's a Pinot
Noir, and the title of the brand says Le White Meat.

1223
01:48:57,055 --> 01:49:00,041
LAURA: Oh no, it's chicken wine. Fuck.

1224
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:01,698
TRAVIS: Oh no, is it really?

1225
01:49:01,698 --> 01:49:04,628
LAURA: Whatever, we'll drink it anyway. It's going
to be disgusting.

1226
01:49:04,628 --> 01:49:10,304
TALIESIN: There's actually a drink called Cock
Ale, which is brewed in a dead chicken.

1227
01:49:10,304 --> 01:49:11,778
TRAVIS: Of <i>course</i> you would know that.

1228
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:17,694
MATT: No, it's regular red wine. But definitely is
labelled with a chicken on it.

1229
01:49:17,694 --> 01:49:18,930
LAURA: That's funny.

1230
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:21,975
LIAM: I'm grabbing a random Two Buck Chuck next to
me on the wall.

1231
01:49:21,975 --> 01:49:25,972
MATT: Same label. They're all the same wine.

1232
01:49:25,972 --> 01:49:31,142
LIAM: Hey, hey, hey. To Vex'ahlia, the dragon
slayer.

1233
01:49:31,142 --> 01:49:32,303
LAURA: Fuck yes!

1234
01:49:32,303 --> 01:49:34,198
LIAM: (slamming) Oh shite, we should do it for
real.

1235
01:49:34,198 --> 01:49:36,605
LAURA: Oh yeah, right, what's up?

1236
01:49:36,605 --> 01:49:39,206
LIAM: Oh man, I'm proud of you.

1237
01:49:39,206 --> 01:49:40,385
LAURA: Thanks!

1238
01:49:40,385 --> 01:49:41,506
LIAM: Yeah.

1239
01:49:41,506 --> 01:49:43,446
LAURA: Is that all you wanted to say?

1240
01:49:43,446 --> 01:49:44,376
LIAM: No.

1241
01:49:44,376 --> 01:49:45,526
LAURA: I didn't think so.

1242
01:49:45,526 --> 01:49:46,854
LIAM: Well, that's three of five.

1243
01:49:46,854 --> 01:49:52,351
LAURA: Yeah.

1244
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:55,904
LIAM: I don't know if we're all going to live, but
I think that collectively we might actually pull

1245
01:49:55,904 --> 01:49:57,192
it off.

1246
01:49:57,192 --> 01:49:59,444
LAURA: I think we have a good shot of it.

1247
01:49:59,444 --> 01:50:03,905
LIAM: Yeah. Almost bit it, out there.

1248
01:50:03,905 --> 01:50:06,295
LAURA: Yeah, I noticed.

1249
01:50:06,295 --> 01:50:07,482
LIAM: Again.

1250
01:50:07,482 --> 01:50:09,737
LAURA: Yes. Scary.

1251
01:50:09,737 --> 01:50:12,729
LIAM: Can I have a hug?

1252
01:50:12,729 --> 01:50:14,436
LAURA: I'm glad you're not dead.

1253
01:50:14,436 --> 01:50:21,226
LIAM: Yeah, old news. We've done it before, we'll
do it again. Hey, do you want to try jumping

1254
01:50:21,226 --> 01:50:22,899
around with those boots?

1255
01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:24,176
LAURA: Oh, I gave them to Grog.

1256
01:50:24,176 --> 01:50:26,051
LIAM: You want to try to jump around anyway?

1257
01:50:26,051 --> 01:50:27,277
LAURA: Sure.

1258
01:50:27,277 --> 01:50:29,265
LIAM: What can you do? How high can you go?

1259
01:50:29,265 --> 01:50:33,551
LAURA: I jump. It's a jump. A normal little jump.

1260
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:34,988
LIAM: It's good, yeah.

1261
01:50:34,988 --> 01:50:36,405
LAURA: Why?

1262
01:50:36,405 --> 01:50:38,639
LIAM: No reason, I'm procrastinating.

1263
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:41,225
LAURA: Oh, yeah. So tell me what you're
procrastinating about?

1264
01:50:41,225 --> 01:50:44,430
LIAM: How long are you going to torture yourself
for?

1265
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:58,149
LAURA: Oh, you fuck. (laughing) What? (muffled)
What are you even talking about right now? Do you

1266
01:50:58,149 --> 01:51:02,908
want to see how high I can jump now? So high. I
get on my broom and I fly up to the ceiling.

1267
01:51:02,908 --> 01:51:06,714
LIAM: Push out the wings. No, I can't!

1268
01:51:06,714 --> 01:51:08,241
MATT: Yeah, you already used it.

1269
01:51:08,241 --> 01:51:09,952
LIAM: Will you come down here and talk to me?

1270
01:51:09,952 --> 01:51:13,771
LAURA: (groans) Fine, fine! Hi.

1271
01:51:13,771 --> 01:51:16,723
LIAM: Yeah. What are you doing?

1272
01:51:16,723 --> 01:51:21,132
LAURA: I don't know! I don't-- what?

1273
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:26,509
LIAM: You know I've known for a while? It's all
over your face, I've known you since you were a

1274
01:51:26,509 --> 01:51:28,283
baby, I've known for a while.

1275
01:51:28,283 --> 01:51:31,303
LAURA: Okay. (nervous laughter)

1276
01:51:31,303 --> 01:51:37,133
LIAM: I've almost died. You <i>have</i> died.

1277
01:51:37,133 --> 01:51:38,256
LAURA: Yes.

1278
01:51:38,256 --> 01:51:39,217
LIAM: He died.

1279
01:51:39,217 --> 01:51:40,077
LAURA: Yes.

1280
01:51:40,077 --> 01:51:41,802
LIAM: What are you fucking doing, Vex?

1281
01:51:41,802 --> 01:51:45,714
LAURA: (sighs) It's just timing, you know? It's
all timing.

1282
01:51:45,714 --> 01:51:50,101
LIAM: Timing could have you dead in the ground
tomorrow.

1283
01:51:50,101 --> 01:51:51,634
LAURA: This is true.

1284
01:51:51,634 --> 01:51:56,579
LIAM: And do you know something? Hey.

1285
01:51:56,579 --> 01:51:57,840
LAURA: Hmm?

1286
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,507
LIAM: He leads with this. Not with that.

1287
01:52:01,507 --> 01:52:02,979
LAURA: His collarbone?

1288
01:52:02,979 --> 01:52:12,909
LIAM: Yeah. Fucking smart-ass. Maybe he'll
surprise you, but I don't know.

1289
01:52:12,909 --> 01:52:18,407
LAURA: I think he isn't thinking that way at all,
and honestly--

1290
01:52:18,407 --> 01:52:23,779
LIAM: (snorts) You're a dummy. I'm the dummy, why
are you such a dummy?

1291
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:36,137
LAURA: I don't know, darling. It seems so trivial.
Doesn't it?

1292
01:52:36,137 --> 01:52:47,040
LIAM: What the fuck do we have in this world
except for moments with each other? That's all

1293
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,617
we've got.

1294
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:49,942
LAURA: Yeah.

1295
01:52:49,942 --> 01:52:54,822
LIAM: I want you to have some happiness in your
life.

1296
01:52:54,822 --> 01:52:56,700
LAURA: I <i>do</i> have happiness!

1297
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:03,998
LIAM: I want you to have a little more. There's no
reason to hold back. Why?

1298
01:53:03,998 --> 01:53:07,503
LAURA: Wouldn't it be so awkward though?

1299
01:53:07,503 --> 01:53:13,267
LIAM: Who cares? You know what's awkward?

1300
01:53:13,267 --> 01:53:14,467
LAURA: Hmm?

1301
01:53:14,467 --> 01:53:16,557
LIAM: A life not lived.

1302
01:53:16,557 --> 01:53:24,273
LAURA: Hey, I'm living a life. I've got Trinket.
I've got you, sometimes, when you're not with

1303
01:53:24,273 --> 01:53:26,167
Keyleth.

1304
01:53:26,167 --> 01:53:41,259
LIAM: Listen, you're my sister, and I love you
very much, and I know a lot about you, and I can

1305
01:53:41,259 --> 01:53:46,217
help you in a lot of ways. But not every way.

1306
01:53:46,217 --> 01:53:47,675
LAURA: I know.

1307
01:53:47,675 --> 01:53:52,037
LIAM: There are facets of you that have nothing to
do with me.

1308
01:53:52,037 --> 01:53:55,395
LAURA: Very few.

1309
01:53:55,395 --> 01:54:03,974
LIAM: I want you to be happy, and we all could be
dead in a week. You know that.

1310
01:54:03,974 --> 01:54:06,149
LAURA: Yeah.

1311
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:10,420
LIAM: I'm a fucking idiot. I don't know anything.

1312
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:13,990
LAURA: (laughing) I want you to remember that you
just said that.

1313
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:21,007
LIAM: I never forget it. Ever. In the game or out
of the game, Laura.

1314
01:54:21,007 --> 01:54:22,976
LAURA: Oh, don't!

1315
01:54:22,976 --> 01:54:35,183
LIAM: It's a short life we got. I'm not going to
tell you what to do, but I won't tell you what to

1316
01:54:35,183 --> 01:54:39,411
do. I do want you to be happy.

1317
01:54:39,411 --> 01:54:43,784
LAURA: Thank you. And I'll try.

1318
01:54:43,784 --> 01:54:51,079
LIAM: And on a side note-- he's a little fucked
up.

1319
01:54:51,079 --> 01:54:52,406
LAURA: Oh, I know.

1320
01:54:52,406 --> 01:54:55,470
LIAM: And he <i>only</i> listens to you.

1321
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:57,781
LAURA: Well, that's not true.

1322
01:54:57,781 --> 01:54:58,741
LIAM: Yes it is.

1323
01:54:58,741 --> 01:54:59,619
LAURA: No!

1324
01:54:59,619 --> 01:55:00,908
LIAM: Who does he listen to?

1325
01:55:00,908 --> 01:55:03,148
LAURA: Keyleth. They're like, so close.

1326
01:55:03,148 --> 01:55:08,345
LIAM: Yeah, they enjoy each other's company, I
know that, but you're really the only one who he

1327
01:55:08,345 --> 01:55:19,627
listens to. So I need you to-- he has impulses. He
has impulse control. I have impulse control.

1328
01:55:19,627 --> 01:55:20,750
LAURA: Yes you do!

1329
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,313
LIAM: He has a different kind of impulse control.

1330
01:55:22,313 --> 01:55:31,214
LAURA: Okay. You want me to control him then. Get
him under my thumb. Bring him to the light, just a

1331
01:55:31,214 --> 01:55:32,636
little bit?

1332
01:55:32,636 --> 01:55:34,498
LIAM: You know what I'm talking about.

1333
01:55:34,498 --> 01:55:36,403
LAURA: I know what you're talking about.

1334
01:55:36,403 --> 01:55:41,440
LIAM: I take another bottle of wine and I
(gulps).

1335
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,876
LAURA: (laughing) I thank you.

1336
01:55:43,876 --> 01:55:47,218
LIAM: Am I drunk, am I at disadvantage now, if do
the whole bottle?

1337
01:55:47,218 --> 01:55:49,970
MATT: In a minute you will be, yeah.

1338
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:51,290
LIAM: Grab another bottle.

1339
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:56,569
LAURA: Hm? Glug glug glug? Well, all right.

1340
01:55:56,569 --> 01:56:02,410
LIAM: (groans) I want to go see some fireballs get
shot, I'll see you later!

1341
01:56:02,410 --> 01:56:04,345
LAURA: Okay, have fun.

1342
01:56:04,345 --> 01:56:05,675
LIAM: Woo!

1343
01:56:05,675 --> 01:56:12,500
MATT: As Vax sloppily leaves the room, you're left
in quiet, by yourself with your--

1344
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,611
LIAM: (booming) And I walk away!

1345
01:56:14,611 --> 01:56:22,448
LAURA: I pop Trinket out, cast Speak with Animals
and have a nice fun conversation with him.

1346
01:56:22,448 --> 01:56:28,690
MATT: We're going to go ahead and take a break
here, come back here in a minute, use the

1347
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:29,733
restroom.

1348
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:31,188
MARISHA: Aw, we haven't done shit!

1349
01:56:31,188 --> 01:56:39,998
MATT: That's not true. You've discussed the spoils
from your last major story bit, so we'll be back

1350
01:56:39,998 --> 01:56:43,651
here in a few minutes. We're going to go ahead and
take a restroom break, fill up on drinks. Stay

1351
01:56:43,651 --> 01:56:45,560
tuned and we'll see you in a minute.

1352
01:56:45,560 --> 02:14:30,243
[break]

1353
02:14:30,243 --> 02:14:35,659
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome back to Critical
Role! After a barrage of delightful phrases that

1354
02:14:35,659 --> 02:14:40,090
were just shouted at me. It's great.

1355
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:41,184
TRAVIS: Love you, Matt!

1356
02:14:41,184 --> 02:14:46,690
MATT: Love you too, guys. I do want to say real
fast that our wonderful Kiki Day, who made a

1357
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:48,273
number of other Vestiges--

1358
02:14:48,273 --> 02:14:49,613
LAURA: Fenthras!

1359
02:14:49,613 --> 02:14:51,481
MATT: Made Fenthras, made--

1360
02:14:51,481 --> 02:14:52,619
MARISHA: And the Spire!

1361
02:14:52,619 --> 02:14:55,247
MATT: Made the Spire of Conflux, which you can see
on Marisha's twitter right now?

1362
02:14:55,247 --> 02:14:56,293
MARISHA: Geek &amp; Sundry's twitter.

1363
02:14:56,293 --> 02:14:59,643
MATT: Geek &amp; Sundry's twitter. As well as making
me a belt buckle that I'm going to be wearing at

1364
02:14:59,643 --> 02:15:00,783
Blizzcon.

1365
02:15:00,783 --> 02:15:03,681
(yelling)

1366
02:15:03,681 --> 02:15:05,558
MATT: That's fucking fantastic.

1367
02:15:05,558 --> 02:15:07,000
TRAVIS: That's a badass motherfucking belt.

1368
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,654
MATT: (McCree voice) Just saying.

1369
02:15:08,654 --> 02:15:12,393
LIAM: (Oprah voice) Spire of Conflux!

1370
02:15:12,393 --> 02:15:15,375
MATT: (McCree voice) Now I've got a reason to go
ahead and wear myself a tucked-in shirt.

1371
02:15:15,375 --> 02:15:23,262
(normal voice) Anyway, let's get into the game. You guys,
finishing those scenes. Taking a short rest. You

1372
02:15:23,262 --> 02:15:27,556
roll your hit dice to heal up a bit. What more do
you wish to accomplish? What's your next plan of

1373
02:15:27,556 --> 02:15:29,284
action, Vox Machina?

1374
02:15:29,284 --> 02:15:34,072
TALIESIN: I say we pack up all of our things and
raid a ship.

1375
02:15:34,072 --> 02:15:39,274
LAURA: And then head back to Whitestone. I mean-- 
Oh, no, we're fine in here.

1376
02:15:39,274 --> 02:15:41,033
SAM and LAURA: Are we?

1377
02:15:41,033 --> 02:15:43,836
MARISHA: Do you want to rest before we do that?

1378
02:15:43,836 --> 02:15:44,851
TALIESIN: I say we--

1379
02:15:44,851 --> 02:15:49,894
SAM: We have to rest. We're all severely injured.

1380
02:15:49,894 --> 02:15:55,815
TALIESIN: Well, some of us, yes. I say we take a
night, we hit the ship and then head home.

1381
02:15:55,815 --> 02:15:58,048
LIAM: It's good wine!

1382
02:15:58,048 --> 02:15:59,518
LAURA: Oh, he's drunk.

1383
02:15:59,518 --> 02:16:02,150
MARISHA: You guys got into the wine?!

1384
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:04,500
SAM: Did you aerate it first?

1385
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:06,223
LIAM: How do you do that?

1386
02:16:06,223 --> 02:16:12,139
SAM: If you don't have an aerator, you can put it
in a mason jar and shake it up a bit.

1387
02:16:12,139 --> 02:16:13,948
LIAM: We just drank it out of the bottle.

1388
02:16:13,948 --> 02:16:17,207
SAM: Well, that's just pedestrian, really.

1389
02:16:17,207 --> 02:16:18,810
LAURA: You have so many.

1390
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:22,513
TALIESIN: Put some ice in it, keep it cold.

1391
02:16:22,513 --> 02:16:25,130
MARISHA: Are we still melting a mask to a helmet?

1392
02:16:25,130 --> 02:16:28,367
TALIESIN: We had a little bit of metallurgy to
do.

1393
02:16:28,367 --> 02:16:32,530
MATT: Make a tinkering check, and this, actually,
make--

1394
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:37,359
MARISHA: I help him with my Heat Metal spell like
a soldering iron.

1395
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:45,026
MATT: Okay! That being the case, it's going to
help with the metal's pliability. Go ahead and

1396
02:16:45,026 --> 02:16:46,683
make your regular dex-based.

1397
02:16:46,683 --> 02:16:48,009
TALIESIN: Regular dex-based? All right.

1398
02:16:48,009 --> 02:16:50,942
MATT: Would make it strength-based for the metal,
but the Heat Metal is helping you with that.

1399
02:16:50,942 --> 02:16:52,159
TALIESIN: All right.

1400
02:16:52,159 --> 02:16:53,957
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies!

1401
02:16:53,957 --> 02:16:55,943
TALIESIN: That's a 26.

1402
02:16:55,943 --> 02:17:01,371
MATT: 26? Yeah, without an issue you manage to
apply the mask onto the back of the helmet after

1403
02:17:01,371 --> 02:17:09,254
looking at some brief glances at the shape of
Grog's head, making sure that it has a hinge so if

1404
02:17:09,254 --> 02:17:16,238
he leans forward, it doesn't restrict or press
into his back if he looks up. It is a functional

1405
02:17:16,238 --> 02:17:19,944
backmask onto his delightful pointed helmet.

1406
02:17:19,944 --> 02:17:25,197
TALIESIN: I've also carved, in Elven, in the
inside, "Kick Me."

1407
02:17:25,197 --> 02:17:27,785
MATT: On the inside of the mask?

1408
02:17:27,785 --> 02:17:29,669
TALIESIN: Yeah. So it's there.

1409
02:17:29,669 --> 02:17:31,689
MARISHA: It's magnificent.

1410
02:17:31,689 --> 02:17:33,004
TALIESIN: I think so.

1411
02:17:33,004 --> 02:17:34,357
MARISHA: Shall we present it to him?

1412
02:17:34,357 --> 02:17:35,472
TALIESIN: Yes, let's.

1413
02:17:35,472 --> 02:17:40,189
MARISHA: I feel like we should go at this with a
little bit of theatricality. Just because it's so

1414
02:17:40,189 --> 02:17:41,613
much fun to fuck with Grog.

1415
02:17:41,613 --> 02:17:42,639
TALIESIN: I know!

1416
02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:43,731
MARISHA: How do you want to do this?

1417
02:17:43,731 --> 02:17:44,735
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1418
02:17:44,735 --> 02:17:49,319
MARISHA: Oh! I turn into an elephant. Get on my
back!

1419
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:52,638
TALIESIN: Did you say that before turning into an
elephant?

1420
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:55,205
MARISHA: Yes, I do! Get on my back!

1421
02:17:55,205 --> 02:17:58,586
LIAM: (elephant sound)

1422
02:17:58,586 --> 02:18:05,743
TALIESIN: For god's sake, Vax, stop aerating more
wine! We've had enough! <i>You've</i> had enough!

1423
02:18:05,743 --> 02:18:08,678
MATT: Sam is so over it.

1424
02:18:08,678 --> 02:18:11,889
TALIESIN: No, never!

1425
02:18:11,889 --> 02:18:17,761
MARISHA: Percy's on my back and I'm an elephant
holding the mask while we go find Grog.

1426
02:18:17,761 --> 02:18:20,437
MATT: Well, first you get to the doorway of the
workshop.

1427
02:18:20,437 --> 02:18:25,438
MARISHA: It's a temporary fucking mansion. I bust
through.

1428
02:18:25,438 --> 02:18:27,433
MATT: Make a strength check.

1429
02:18:27,433 --> 02:18:35,761
MARISHA: I don't know how to-- Will you put this
in dice jail for me?

1430
02:18:35,761 --> 02:18:37,068
LAURA: You got it.

1431
02:18:37,068 --> 02:18:38,459
MATT: What'd you roll?

1432
02:18:38,459 --> 02:18:39,798
MARISHA: I don't know. What do I roll for a--

1433
02:18:39,798 --> 02:18:43,115
MATT: Look it up. You add your strength modifier
as an elephant.

1434
02:18:43,115 --> 02:18:45,725
MARISHA: Well, I don't know what an elephant's
stats are!

1435
02:18:45,725 --> 02:18:50,750
MATT: I'm going to find it right now. I'm going to
find for you what an elephant's stats are! Just

1436
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:51,906
going to go look it up for you!

1437
02:18:51,906 --> 02:18:53,107
MARISHA: Well, I rolled a two!

1438
02:18:53,107 --> 02:18:54,175
MATT: You rolled a what, a two?

1439
02:18:54,175 --> 02:18:55,143
MARISHA: Yeah, a two.

1440
02:18:55,143 --> 02:18:56,360
SAM: It's not going to work!

1441
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:58,262
MARISHA: I'm a fucking elephant and it's a door!

1442
02:18:58,262 --> 02:19:05,469
MATT: It's plus six because it has a strength of
22 because it's a goddamn elephant. So eight. You

1443
02:19:05,469 --> 02:19:12,346
(slam). It lurches ever so slightly, but that is a
very strong doorway. It's almost like the arcane

1444
02:19:12,346 --> 02:19:14,487
nature of Scanlan's magic makes a good home.

1445
02:19:14,487 --> 02:19:15,822
MARISHA: Can I try it again?

1446
02:19:15,822 --> 02:19:18,518
MATT: You hit it again. Make another strength
check.

1447
02:19:18,518 --> 02:19:23,181
MARISHA: That's much better! 16 total!

1448
02:19:23,181 --> 02:19:31,845
MATT: 16. It causes some of the plaster to crack.
Doesn't get that much further, but you're starting

1449
02:19:31,845 --> 02:19:33,058
to get a serious headache.

1450
02:19:33,058 --> 02:19:35,567
TRAVIS: Are we hearing this? Are we hearing a
massive commotion?

1451
02:19:35,567 --> 02:19:39,345
MATT: You're starting to hear it now. There's this
low, general slamming sound in the mansion.

1452
02:19:39,345 --> 02:19:40,440
LAURA: What is that?

1453
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:41,945
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you hear that?

1454
02:19:41,945 --> 02:19:45,826
SAM: I do. Doesn't sound right.

1455
02:19:45,826 --> 02:19:47,427
LAURA: Should we go find out?

1456
02:19:47,427 --> 02:19:50,221
SAM: I pull out Mythcarver and run down the
stairs!

1457
02:19:50,221 --> 02:19:52,175
TRAVIS: I take out the bloodaxe and I follow him!

1458
02:19:52,175 --> 02:19:53,799
MATT: Another strength check.

1459
02:19:53,799 --> 02:19:58,164
MARISHA: They get better with each time. 19!

1460
02:19:58,164 --> 02:20:04,926
MATT: 19. The door gets knocked partially off of
its hinges and the frame is now slightly bent

1461
02:20:04,926 --> 02:20:09,820
forward. The wood is splintered and the stone has
more cracks into it. The headache is now

1462
02:20:09,820 --> 02:20:11,124
pounding.

1463
02:20:11,124 --> 02:20:12,666
MARISHA: I should have thought about this!

1464
02:20:12,666 --> 02:20:18,297
MATT: You guys hear another, even louder slam this
time. As you rush down to the outside of Percy's

1465
02:20:18,297 --> 02:20:25,483
workshop you see some crazed, large, shifting gray
movement of some creature, on the other side of

1466
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:26,326
the doorway.

1467
02:20:26,326 --> 02:20:27,625
TRAVIS: Jesus! Scanlan, is this one yours?

1468
02:20:27,625 --> 02:20:30,289
SAM: No. It's definitely an intruder.

1469
02:20:30,289 --> 02:20:34,645
TRAVIS: Then we fucking kill it! We race forward
and attack.

1470
02:20:34,645 --> 02:20:36,607
MATT: All right, both of you guys roll a--

1471
02:20:36,607 --> 02:20:38,612
LIAM: Wait, is Percy still riding?

1472
02:20:38,612 --> 02:20:41,146
MATT: You don't see Percy, because Percy's above
you!

1473
02:20:41,146 --> 02:20:47,417
TALIESIN: Am I aware of this happening? At
all, I don't see them at all?

1474
02:20:47,417 --> 02:20:51,236
MATT: No, because you're inside the workshop and
you're above the doorframe she's slamming into.

1475
02:20:51,236 --> 02:20:52,481
TRAVIS: 23.

1476
02:20:52,481 --> 02:20:53,836
SAM: One.

1477
02:20:53,836 --> 02:21:02,846
MATT: So Scanlan, you go running with Mythcarver
in the air, and as you go to strike, Grog shoves

1478
02:21:02,846 --> 02:21:08,122
you out of the way, in the middle of his angry
grab and you go skidding across the ground,

1479
02:21:08,122 --> 02:21:14,737
Mythcarver spinning out of your grasp across the
floor. Are you making a single attack or are you

1480
02:21:14,737 --> 02:21:16,461
doing a full round of attacks on this beast?

1481
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:19,097
TRAVIS: This is a giant beast, I'm giving it what
for!

1482
02:21:19,097 --> 02:21:21,672
MATT: So roll another attack, are you raging for
this?

1483
02:21:21,672 --> 02:21:27,863
TRAVIS: No, I'm not raging. (laughing) 24.

1484
02:21:27,863 --> 02:21:31,596
MATT: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
both attacks, non-rage damage.

1485
02:21:31,596 --> 02:21:37,030
MARISHA: No, go with it. Go with it.

1486
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:39,046
TRAVIS: 20 points, four points of necrotic.

1487
02:21:39,046 --> 02:21:40,330
LAURA: Oh god.

1488
02:21:40,330 --> 02:21:42,359
TRAVIS: I know, I don't hit lightly.

1489
02:21:42,359 --> 02:21:44,502
SAM: Elephant's going to die.

1490
02:21:44,502 --> 02:21:49,223
TRAVIS: 22 points of damage.

1491
02:21:49,223 --> 02:21:54,777
MATT: You take 42 points of damage from your
maximum of 76 hit points as an elephant, as all of

1492
02:21:54,777 --> 02:21:57,941
a sudden, what little bit of vision you have
through the pounding headache, you glance through

1493
02:21:57,941 --> 02:22:02,148
in time to see Grog's form (roaring) run up and
slam his axe into you twice.

1494
02:22:02,148 --> 02:22:04,573
MARISHA: How much damage?

1495
02:22:04,573 --> 02:22:06,017
MATT: 42.

1496
02:22:06,017 --> 02:22:07,320
MARISHA: What's my form?

1497
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:08,355
MATT: 76.

1498
02:22:08,355 --> 02:22:12,424
MARISHA: I fucking headbutt him, I'm going to
gorge him! Let's go!

1499
02:22:12,424 --> 02:22:14,027
MATT: You're going to gorge him?

1500
02:22:14,027 --> 02:22:16,279
TRAVIS: Scanlan!

1501
02:22:16,279 --> 02:22:19,732
SAM: Careful Grog, it has some protection magic on
it. It threw me across the room!

1502
02:22:19,732 --> 02:22:26,581
(laughter)

1503
02:22:26,581 --> 02:22:34,705
MATT: All right, Marisha. I would like you to roll
for a gore attack against Grog.

1504
02:22:34,705 --> 02:22:38,161
LAURA: This is ridiculous.

1505
02:22:38,161 --> 02:22:40,079
MARISHA: What do I add? I don't have a stat.

1506
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:40,972
MATT: Plus eight.

1507
02:22:40,972 --> 02:22:42,066
MARISHA: 18.

1508
02:22:42,066 --> 02:22:47,284
MATT: 18? No, I don't think that hits you. So you
go ahead and try and gore Grog, and Grog ducks

1509
02:22:47,284 --> 02:22:49,972
right beneath the two giant ivory horns.

1510
02:22:49,972 --> 02:22:52,056
MARISHA: Do I knock down the doorway a little bit
more?

1511
02:22:52,056 --> 02:22:53,771
MATT: Make a strength check.

1512
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:56,112
MARISHA: Okay. 20 total.

1513
02:22:56,112 --> 02:23:02,713
MATT: With that, as you duck below, the elephant
slams through the archway, sending stone and

1514
02:23:02,713 --> 02:23:08,120
pieces of wood flying, and stumbles past. You duck
down to try and the avoid the attack, going

1515
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,672
underneath the elephant as it begins to stomp over
you into the room. You see this as you spin

1516
02:23:12,672 --> 02:23:16,822
around. The elephant bursts in, and it is very
much an elephant, you can see now, with Percy on

1517
02:23:16,822 --> 02:23:19,190
top being dragged through the rubble.

1518
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:22,646
TALIESIN: I'm thankfully wearing a helmet.

1519
02:23:22,646 --> 02:23:25,092
SAM: It's got Percival!

1520
02:23:25,092 --> 02:23:27,739
TRAVIS: Roll off! Roll off, Percy!

1521
02:23:27,739 --> 02:23:31,811
TALIESIN: (deadpan) Oh help. Help, please.

1522
02:23:31,811 --> 02:23:33,884
TRAVIS: He's so weak he can barely speak!

1523
02:23:33,884 --> 02:23:36,080
SAM: We must kill this elephant.

1524
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:37,752
TRAVIS: We must destroy this beast!

1525
02:23:37,752 --> 02:23:39,689
MATT: Scanlan and Grog, what are you doing?

1526
02:23:39,689 --> 02:23:42,753
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

1527
02:23:42,753 --> 02:23:44,782
SAM: We got to kill this thing.

1528
02:23:44,782 --> 02:23:46,517
TRAVIS: Yeah, you go. Come on.

1529
02:23:46,517 --> 02:23:51,670
SAM: I will throw a Wand of Fireballs at it.

1530
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:53,692
MATT: How many charges does it have left?

1531
02:23:53,692 --> 02:23:55,958
SAM: Oh, plenty. I have only used one of seven.

1532
02:23:55,958 --> 02:24:07,128
MATT: But each time you use it-- okay. Not quite
how it works, I don't think.

1533
02:24:07,128 --> 02:24:14,407
LIAM: Just look at the shirt, Matt, just look at
his shirt.

1534
02:24:14,407 --> 02:24:18,813
MATT: Oh, you're right. One charge is a third
level spell, I misunderstood. So you launch your

1535
02:24:18,813 --> 02:24:20,348
Fireball, go ahead and roll damage.

1536
02:24:20,348 --> 02:24:25,637
SAM: Oh wait, what is the damage? It's 8d6. Got
it.

1537
02:24:25,637 --> 02:24:31,254
MATT: 8d6. Keyleth, I need you to roll a d20 minus
one.

1538
02:24:31,254 --> 02:24:37,512
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Rolling your die!
Wait, a d20 minus one? (laughing) Six total.

1539
02:24:37,512 --> 02:24:39,066
Goddamn it Gil.

1540
02:24:39,066 --> 02:24:41,526
MATT: Okay. Percy, I need you to roll a dexterity
saving throw.

1541
02:24:41,526 --> 02:24:52,854
TALIESIN: That's not bad, that's 18.

1542
02:24:52,854 --> 02:24:54,895
MATT: Okay, what was the damage you said?

1543
02:24:54,895 --> 02:24:55,928
SAM: 26.

1544
02:24:55,928 --> 02:24:59,371
MATT: I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw,
with advantage.

1545
02:24:59,371 --> 02:25:02,637
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1546
02:25:02,637 --> 02:25:06,385
MARISHA: I'm still wearing my cloak, so do they
get disadvantage on attacks against me? Because

1547
02:25:06,385 --> 02:25:07,713
I'm in the Cloak of Displacement.

1548
02:25:07,713 --> 02:25:08,991
SAM: You're an elephant though.

1549
02:25:08,991 --> 02:25:10,421
TALIESIN: You're an elephant in the Cloak of
Displacement.

1550
02:25:10,421 --> 02:25:14,374
MARISHA: But whenever I Beast Shape I absorb my
items.

1551
02:25:14,374 --> 02:25:22,652
MATT: That would have been something to mention
earlier, so going forward the attacks will have

1552
02:25:22,652 --> 02:25:25,007
disadvantage, but you have to remember that for it
to have an effect.

1553
02:25:25,007 --> 02:25:26,528
MARISHA: But they're just now rolling.

1554
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:31,442
MATT: He hasn't attacked yet, he's rolling because
a Fireball just blew up in his face!

1555
02:25:31,442 --> 02:25:33,160
TRAVIS: I got a natural 20, so I'm good.

1556
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,556
MATT: So that's half damage to you. You said it
was 26 damage?

1557
02:25:35,556 --> 02:25:36,565
SAM: 26.

1558
02:25:36,565 --> 02:25:42,102
MATT: So 13 points of fire damage to Percy and
Grog, and a full 26 points of fire damage to you.

1559
02:25:42,102 --> 02:25:52,326
That puts you at a total of 42 plus 26, so 68.
You're still up. The elephant that's now storming

1560
02:25:52,326 --> 02:25:56,478
through the center-- hold on, I have to go with
the battle music for this now.

1561
02:25:56,478 --> 02:25:58,919
SAM: Where's your battle map?

1562
02:25:58,919 --> 02:26:04,718
MATT: --storming through the center of the foyer,
is now spinning around, flames exploding,

1563
02:26:04,718 --> 02:26:12,527
engulfing Percy, Grog. The elephant is now covered
in blood and scrapes. That finishes your go. Grog,

1564
02:26:12,527 --> 02:26:13,510
you're up.

1565
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:18,913
SAM: Before I'm done I'm going to inspire Grog and
say: Grog, remember. They never forget!

1566
02:26:18,913 --> 02:26:25,008
(laughter)

1567
02:26:25,008 --> 02:26:27,893
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration.

1568
02:26:27,893 --> 02:26:34,277
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'll take two strikes at the
elephant's ass. That's a one.

1569
02:26:34,277 --> 02:26:35,455
MATT: With disadvantage.

1570
02:26:35,455 --> 02:26:37,051
TRAVIS: Oh. Well, that's a one, so.

1571
02:26:37,051 --> 02:26:38,689
MATT: I know. You still have the second attack.

1572
02:26:38,689 --> 02:26:41,147
TRAVIS: That's a two.

1573
02:26:41,147 --> 02:26:44,951
MARISHA: (heavy footsteps)

1574
02:26:44,951 --> 02:26:46,321
MATT: So as you go--

1575
02:26:46,321 --> 02:26:48,991
LAURA: Wait, it's not a two!

1576
02:26:48,991 --> 02:26:54,303
TRAVIS: So the second one was 16, the first one
was a 15.

1577
02:26:54,303 --> 02:27:01,191
MATT: It still hits. You rolled a two and it still
hits because its AC is 12. It's very big and easy

1578
02:27:01,191 --> 02:27:02,785
to hit. Go ahead and roll damage on the next
attack.

1579
02:27:02,785 --> 02:27:04,620
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. What a joy!

1580
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:06,088
TALIESIN: It's not hard to hit an elephant.

1581
02:27:06,088 --> 02:27:09,199
LIAM: Can we also say that the two winos have come
down to watch?

1582
02:27:09,199 --> 02:27:11,364
LAURA: Yeah, we're staring from the top of the
stairs at all of it happening.

1583
02:27:11,364 --> 02:27:14,599
TRAVIS: The first one is 20, with four points of
necrotic damage.

1584
02:27:14,599 --> 02:27:15,710
MATT: You only hit with one.

1585
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:16,568
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

1586
02:27:16,568 --> 02:27:17,688
MATT: How much was that, 20 points?

1587
02:27:17,688 --> 02:27:18,577
TRAVIS: Yeah, 20.

1588
02:27:18,577 --> 02:27:27,975
MATT: Okay, so Keyleth, you yourself take 12
points of damage. As your axe swings through and

1589
02:27:27,975 --> 02:27:34,612
slams into the elephant, the elephant's form
suddenly vanishes, as your axe cleaves through

1590
02:27:34,612 --> 02:27:39,497
Keyleth a little bit, causing her to fall back and
catch herself.

1591
02:27:39,497 --> 02:27:41,774
LAURA: Is Percy still on her back, piggy-backing?

1592
02:27:41,774 --> 02:27:44,752
MATT: In a second, Percy goes (thud) on the ground
next to you.

1593
02:27:44,752 --> 02:27:46,103
MARISHA: (pained noise)

1594
02:27:46,103 --> 02:27:50,473
TRAVIS: Percy, you've been riding Raishan! Die,
evil witch!

1595
02:27:50,473 --> 02:27:53,188
LAURA: Grog! It's Keyleth.

1596
02:27:53,188 --> 02:27:59,981
MARISHA: Oh, Grog, thank you! That elephant ate
me! You saved me!

1597
02:27:59,981 --> 02:28:00,932
TRAVIS: I did?

1598
02:28:00,932 --> 02:28:02,079
MARISHA: You did.

1599
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:08,822
TRAVIS: Sometimes I don't know if you guys would
live without me. I'm really glad I'm around,

1600
02:28:08,822 --> 02:28:09,915
sometimes.

1601
02:28:09,915 --> 02:28:13,524
TALIESIN: I can't imagine it. I legitimately
cannot imagine it.

1602
02:28:13,524 --> 02:28:14,797
TRAVIS: Ooh, is that my helmet?!

1603
02:28:14,797 --> 02:28:16,023
TALIESIN: It is!

1604
02:28:16,023 --> 02:28:23,018
LIAM: Ayy, Fredrickstein the Science Guy, nice
job! Look at that! That is beautiful.

1605
02:28:23,018 --> 02:28:24,511
LAURA: (whispering) He's drunk.

1606
02:28:24,511 --> 02:28:26,459
MARISHA: The elephant ate this too.

1607
02:28:26,459 --> 02:28:28,468
TALIESIN: It's Dr. Fredrickstein, please.

1608
02:28:28,468 --> 02:28:31,594
TRAVIS: Is there poo on it?

1609
02:28:31,594 --> 02:28:35,652
MARISHA: No, it's good.

1610
02:28:35,652 --> 02:28:37,955
TALIESIN: It's clean. It's perfectly reasonable.

1611
02:28:37,955 --> 02:28:43,560
TRAVIS: Ooh, the mask's on the back. Did you write
on the inside like I said?

1612
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:46,183
TALIESIN: It is engraved in Elven on the inside,
it's lovely.

1613
02:28:46,183 --> 02:28:51,773
TRAVIS: It looks like writing. What's it--

1614
02:28:51,773 --> 02:28:53,128
TALIESIN: It's your title, sir.

1615
02:28:53,128 --> 02:28:54,840
TRAVIS: --is that? What language?

1616
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:56,529
LAURA: Oh, that? It's Elvish.

1617
02:28:56,529 --> 02:29:00,236
TRAVIS: Oh, it's Elvish? So not everybody knows
what my title is.

1618
02:29:00,236 --> 02:29:02,150
TALIESIN: It's meant to be secret.

1619
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:05,785
TRAVIS: Very smart. Did you see my title?

1620
02:29:05,785 --> 02:29:07,104
LAURA: I did, it's impressive.

1621
02:29:07,104 --> 02:29:08,851
MARISHA: I wrote it down.

1622
02:29:08,851 --> 02:29:10,052
TALIESIN: Did you? Oh dear.

1623
02:29:10,052 --> 02:29:11,505
MARISHA: I knew it was going to be handy.

1624
02:29:11,505 --> 02:29:15,158
TRAVIS: I will put on the new mask slash horned
helm.

1625
02:29:15,158 --> 02:29:18,231
MATT: It feels impressive.

1626
02:29:18,231 --> 02:29:19,465
TRAVIS: Does it?

1627
02:29:19,465 --> 02:29:20,312
MATT: Yeah.

1628
02:29:20,312 --> 02:29:25,985
TRAVIS: Actually, because now the mask is facing
the back, right? Can I fucking turn it around and

1629
02:29:25,985 --> 02:29:30,842
put the mask on the front, with the horn sticking
out the back like a big Nike swoosh?

1630
02:29:30,842 --> 02:29:34,454
MATT: You can. It's not as comfortable, but it
definitely feels badass.

1631
02:29:34,454 --> 02:29:36,360
TRAVIS: (muffled) I don't feel like this is the
best--

1632
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:39,054
TALIESIN: You sound very intimidating.

1633
02:29:39,054 --> 02:29:42,320
LIAM: He got polymorphed into De Niro.

1634
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:45,025
(laughter)

1635
02:29:45,025 --> 02:29:49,370
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

1636
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:54,970
SAM: I feel like I'm going to have to write some
house rules from now on.

1637
02:29:54,970 --> 02:29:58,215
TALIESIN: It'd be good to have a list of things to
ignore, I agree.

1638
02:29:58,215 --> 02:30:02,812
LIAM: You need some of those blue guys with an
aerator at all times down in those cellars.

1639
02:30:02,812 --> 02:30:04,025
SAM: Blue man group?

1640
02:30:04,025 --> 02:30:07,703
LIAM: One of your blue guys! The blue guys! That
disappears with this place--

1641
02:30:07,703 --> 02:30:16,244
SAM: My hundreds of--? There's no guys here.
They're all female servants. I don't know how many

1642
02:30:16,244 --> 02:30:17,622
times I need to say this.

1643
02:30:17,622 --> 02:30:22,865
LIAM: Well, nobody farted in our wine tonight. We
had to drink it regular.

1644
02:30:22,865 --> 02:30:31,494
SAM: I am sorry for your loss, because it's really
excellent once you let it breathe and open up.

1645
02:30:31,494 --> 02:30:33,412
LIAM: It's pretty good right now.

1646
02:30:33,412 --> 02:30:40,633
TRAVIS: Well, now that I got my helmet, are we
going down to the ship?

1647
02:30:40,633 --> 02:30:46,188
TALIESIN: I propose that we have an evening's
rest. In the morning--

1648
02:30:46,188 --> 02:30:47,754
LIAM: We should go now.

1649
02:30:47,754 --> 02:30:51,523
LAURA: No. Maybe you need to rest.

1650
02:30:51,523 --> 02:30:54,047
TALIESIN: No, I think we need an evening's rest.

1651
02:30:54,047 --> 02:30:55,756
LIAM: I have 25 hit points. I'm fine!

1652
02:30:55,756 --> 02:31:00,806
LAURA: Yeah. Well, Pike is resting because she was
hurt quite badly.

1653
02:31:00,806 --> 02:31:03,852
LIAM: Yeah, but did you see her fun buns, though?
I did those.

1654
02:31:03,852 --> 02:31:05,338
LAURA: I didn't.

1655
02:31:05,338 --> 02:31:06,651
TALIESIN: You did her fun buns?

1656
02:31:06,651 --> 02:31:08,564
LIAM: Yeah, I pulled little fun buns--

1657
02:31:08,564 --> 02:31:10,137
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay! That's good--

1658
02:31:10,137 --> 02:31:11,870
LIAM: What do you think I meant?

1659
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:13,293
TALIESIN: I didn't think anything, I'm going
up.

1660
02:31:13,293 --> 02:31:16,859
LIAM: What else does fun buns mean except for
little, cute, little hairballs on your hair?

1661
02:31:16,859 --> 02:31:18,536
SAM: I'll give you a book later.

1662
02:31:18,536 --> 02:31:20,131
LAURA: Oh, yeah! You have a book?

1663
02:31:20,131 --> 02:31:23,651
SAM: I have a few. I have a library.

1664
02:31:23,651 --> 02:31:30,559
LIAM: Oh, gosh! Neither Vax nor Liam knew there
was anything other than little cute hair buns--

1665
02:31:30,559 --> 02:31:34,118
Fun buns. What is a "fun bun" besides a fun bun?

1666
02:31:34,118 --> 02:31:36,719
MATT:	Ask Larkin.

1667
02:31:36,719 --> 02:31:40,410
LIAM: You guys! We got to find Larkin!

1668
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:47,619
MATT: Okay. All right, so you guys take your long
rest. You regain your spells, you're all full hit

1669
02:31:47,619 --> 02:31:55,422
points, you regain half your max hit dice. So if
you spent more than half of your hit dice, you still--

1670
02:31:55,422 --> 02:32:01,115
LAURA: Do we keep our hit dice from our Heroes'
Feast? If we never got rid of them? Or are they gone?

1671
02:32:01,115 --> 02:32:03,668
MATT: No. By the time you'd wake up, they'd be
gone, probably.

1672
02:32:03,668 --> 02:32:08,414
LIAM: Can you use the hit-- never mind.

1673
02:32:08,414 --> 02:32:18,102
SAM: When they wake up in the morning, Vax has a
bill under his door for three bottles of wine. And

1674
02:32:18,102 --> 02:32:23,794
Vex for one bottle. And Keyleth for a construction
bill of 5,000 gold pieces.

1675
02:32:23,794 --> 02:32:30,692
LAURA: I promptly rip the fuck out of my bill.

1676
02:32:30,692 --> 02:32:33,954
MARISHA: I think it's a scam, and I throw it
away.

1677
02:32:33,954 --> 02:32:35,023
MATT: Okay.

1678
02:32:35,023 --> 02:32:37,089
SAM: It is a scam.

1679
02:32:37,089 --> 02:32:40,390
(laughter)

1680
02:32:40,390 --> 02:32:50,621
MATT: All right. Well-rested. A fresher day. The
mansion, growing fairly close to probably

1681
02:32:50,621 --> 02:32:53,973
expending the rest of its magic. What do you guys
do?

1682
02:32:53,973 --> 02:32:57,824
TALIESIN: Let's pack our things, head down and
take a look at that pirate ship, then head home.

1683
02:32:57,824 --> 02:33:02,177
Well, that ship. I don't know if it has pirate
symbols, but I'm very excited.

1684
02:33:02,177 --> 02:33:06,608
MARISHA: So wait, do we need things-- how far
under the ice is it?

1685
02:33:06,608 --> 02:33:11,807
TALIESIN: Probably a bit. Having the ability to
melt some ice would probably be helpful. Also,

1686
02:33:11,807 --> 02:33:18,090
you're going to have to do the tree teleport and
possibly we want to deal with reforestation of

1687
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:19,073
some kind.

1688
02:33:19,073 --> 02:33:22,943
MARISHA: Reforestation. Oh, sure because the Ice
Age wiped out--

1689
02:33:22,943 --> 02:33:26,386
TALIESIN: We have to go out like Captain EO. It's
a thing.

1690
02:33:26,386 --> 02:33:27,622
MARISHA: Yeah!

1691
02:33:27,622 --> 02:33:31,887
SAM: Just throwing this out there, is there
anything to gain by going up to the dragon lair

1692
02:33:31,887 --> 02:33:35,494
and communicating with Thordak? Is there anything
we want to say to him?

1693
02:33:35,494 --> 02:33:37,344
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

1694
02:33:37,344 --> 02:33:39,400
SAM: Misdirection? Taunting? Anything?

1695
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,828
TRAVIS: Like, you suck. You can find us at the
Glintshore?

1696
02:33:41,828 --> 02:33:46,640
LIAM:	We don't even want to take an hour for
me to slip this on and go see if there's anything

1697
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,249
of value?

1698
02:33:48,249 --> 02:33:49,270
SAM: Up in the lair?

1699
02:33:49,270 --> 02:33:50,267
LIAM: Yes.

1700
02:33:50,267 --> 02:33:53,486
LAURA: You can do that while we look at the ship.

1701
02:33:53,486 --> 02:33:55,525
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.

1702
02:33:55,525 --> 02:34:01,083
SAM: But don't go alone. You can still get
hit with traps.

1703
02:34:01,083 --> 02:34:05,622
LIAM: I can look for those. I do like buddies to
go. Do you need to go to the boat?

1704
02:34:05,622 --> 02:34:07,516
TALIESIN: It's all in the same place.

1705
02:34:07,516 --> 02:34:09,447
LAURA: Yeah. It's all in the same place.

1706
02:34:09,447 --> 02:34:11,305
SAM: I can hover above you or something.

1707
02:34:11,305 --> 02:34:13,360
TRAVIS: Let's jauntily head over.

1708
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:16,862
TALIESIN: If there's a problem, we can call the
others. We won't be that far away.

1709
02:34:16,862 --> 02:34:22,788
LIAM: All right. Ooh! I slip Whisper into my pack
and I put this ring on.

1710
02:34:22,788 --> 02:34:25,099
SAM: (whispers) Ooh! Precious!

1711
02:34:25,099 --> 02:34:29,302
LAURA: Right, so you have to attune to that.

1712
02:34:29,302 --> 02:34:30,530
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty!

1713
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:31,492
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1714
02:34:31,492 --> 02:34:32,621
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty!

1715
02:34:32,621 --> 02:34:35,777
TRAVIS: Nasty woman.

1716
02:34:35,777 --> 02:34:40,700
LIAM: (Gollum voice) She's a nasty woman!

1717
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:44,852
(laughter)

1718
02:34:44,852 --> 02:34:46,620
TALIESIN: Oh, I may need a ringtone later.

1719
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:52,271
MATT: Yeah. All right, great. So you guys have put
yourselves together. Kima and Pike joined you

1720
02:34:52,306 --> 02:34:59,624
downstairs in the foyer. You make your way back
out into the ravine just as the magic of the mansion

1721
02:34:59,624 --> 02:35:07,586
fades. There you can see most of the dragon bones
picked entirely off the corpse of Vorugal, except

1722
02:35:07,586 --> 02:35:14,585
for the ribcage, still remaining as a landmark of
the battle that took place with a central tree

1723
02:35:14,585 --> 02:35:16,321
still sprouting from the top of it.

1724
02:35:16,321 --> 02:35:19,482
LAURA: Is it any bigger?

1725
02:35:19,482 --> 02:35:26,096
MATT: No, the magic of Fenthras creates the tree and
it stays that size as it sprouts. Who knows if over

1726
02:35:26,096 --> 02:35:32,822
time it may grow? You haven't had the time to
really tell. You guys make your way--

1727
02:35:32,822 --> 02:35:34,689
MARISHA: I didn't know you are an artist.

1728
02:35:34,689 --> 02:35:35,797
LAURA: It's quite lovely, isn't it?

1729
02:35:35,797 --> 02:35:37,991
MARISHA: It's pretty amazing, yes. I appreciate
this.

1730
02:35:37,991 --> 02:35:40,991
LAURA: You're welcome. I did it for you, Keyleth.

1731
02:35:40,991 --> 02:35:46,240
TALIESIN: Certainly adds something, doesn't
it? To the whole valley. It's quite nice.

1732
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:47,869
TRAVIS: Yeah. Green.

1733
02:35:47,869 --> 02:35:53,620
MATT: The weather has cleared up. There's breaks
in the clouds. It's still mostly cloud-covered,

1734
02:35:53,620 --> 02:36:00,172
but you do see glimpses of blue sky here and
there. Still cold, still see your breath out in

1735
02:36:00,172 --> 02:36:08,612
the air. But the temperature does feel slightly
warmer than it was the day before. You begin to

1736
02:36:08,612 --> 02:36:15,247
walk down to the ravine center on the north side
of the ravine where Vorugal's lair once resided.

1737
02:36:15,247 --> 02:36:20,356
You can see hundreds of footprints, up and down, through 
the snow, through the ravine; looks like there's been a lot

1738
02:36:20,356 --> 02:36:28,419
of foot traffic to and from while you guys were
resting. You make your way to the ice throne of

1739
02:36:28,419 --> 02:36:36,216
Vorugal and you see a portion of it has collapsed
inward. But you also see a lot of foot traffic

1740
02:36:36,216 --> 02:36:41,910
around, most of the ice spires that remained up
there have been broken. The remaining Draconian

1741
02:36:41,910 --> 02:36:46,553
corpses that were adorning them were taken down,
or aren't in sight. And you can see there are a few

1742
02:36:46,553 --> 02:36:52,660
remaining dragonborn Ravenites that are stepping
in and out of the cavern-like chamber that you

1743
02:36:52,660 --> 02:36:56,495
largely punched through and they continued to
excavate it into the night.

1744
02:36:56,495 --> 02:37:03,647
TALIESIN: If you could let them know that we're
going to make one last venture into the ship and

1745
02:37:03,647 --> 02:37:05,123
then we'll be on our way.

1746
02:37:05,123 --> 02:37:12,366
LAURA: I walk up to one of the guys going in, and
say in Draconic, have you unearthed the giant

1747
02:37:12,366 --> 02:37:13,803
ship yet?

1748
02:37:13,803 --> 02:37:25,329
MATT: He looks for a second and says, "It is
nothing for us. But we've worked around it." He

1749
02:37:25,329 --> 02:37:30,408
points down, and you can see the portion of it that
has collapsed, filled in part at the side and

1750
02:37:30,408 --> 02:37:37,273
shoveled out in these large chunks of ice that 
are sitting outside of this cavern area. Parts of the

1751
02:37:37,319 --> 02:37:43,869
ship have been moved around-- it looks like it's
been somewhat damaged. It's not a full ship. It's a

1752
02:37:43,869 --> 02:37:52,388
large portion of a ship. It looks like in whatever
battle or attack that Vorugal took this ship,

1753
02:37:52,388 --> 02:37:59,802
it destroyed a huge portion of it in doing so and
took the rest of it with it, in pieces. And it is

1754
02:37:59,802 --> 02:38:08,220
a very pretty ship. It looks like it may have been
the jewel of a navy somewhere. And here it resides.

1755
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:18,519
However, it does appear like the ship has seen
many moons since it was originally taken, if that

1756
02:38:18,519 --> 02:38:23,492
makes any sense. Like, it wasn't brought directly
here. It looks like almost a keepsake that

1757
02:38:23,492 --> 02:38:26,057
Vorugal has moved from lair to lair.

1758
02:38:26,057 --> 02:38:27,978
LIAM: (whispers) Oh, that's legit!

1759
02:38:27,978 --> 02:38:30,112
MATT: Has some sort of sentimental value.

1760
02:38:30,112 --> 02:38:35,517
LAURA: Oh, wow! It had some engraving on it. You
speak a lot of languages, right?

1761
02:38:35,517 --> 02:38:39,272
TALIESIN: Well. I speak a couple of languages, I
read a couple.

1762
02:38:39,272 --> 02:38:40,501
MARISHA: What is it?

1763
02:38:40,501 --> 02:38:42,972
TALIESIN: Does it look familiar?

1764
02:38:42,972 --> 02:38:45,459
MATT: What languages do you know?

1765
02:38:45,459 --> 02:38:47,136
TALIESIN: Celestial, Elven, Common.

1766
02:38:47,136 --> 02:38:51,242
MARISHA: Sylvan, Primordial, Druidic, Elven.

1767
02:38:51,242 --> 02:38:53,115
TRAVIS: Giant, Common.

1768
02:38:53,115 --> 02:38:56,081
SAM: Gnomish. That's it.

1769
02:38:56,081 --> 02:39:00,222
MATT: You don't even know Common. No one has
understood you this entire game!

1770
02:39:00,222 --> 02:39:03,692
LAURA: Pike speaks Dwarvish.

1771
02:39:03,692 --> 02:39:06,586
MATT: Pike does pick up on it. It is Dwarvish
text.

1772
02:39:06,586 --> 02:39:10,174
TRAVIS: I speak Dwarvish, but I can't read.

1773
02:39:10,174 --> 02:39:12,383
MATT: That is a problem.

1774
02:39:12,383 --> 02:39:13,946
TRAVIS: I have a belt, yeah.

1775
02:39:13,946 --> 02:39:22,922
MATT: It is Dwarven, and as Pike begins reading
around it, this-- it's the name of the ship across

1776
02:39:22,922 --> 02:39:33,488
the mast, which is "The Floebreaker." This ship
appears to have been, at least in some way, shape, or

1777
02:39:33,488 --> 02:39:43,038
form, designed as a means of travelling through very
far north icy regions, meant to break through

1778
02:39:43,038 --> 02:39:49,039
elements of heavy glacier flows and such. The
construction of it, as you get closer to the

1779
02:39:49,039 --> 02:39:53,633
actual bit of the ship that is there, you can see
it's very heavily reinforced with metal and has a

1780
02:39:53,633 --> 02:40:01,894
very rigid structure to it. The fine scrolling
that you saw before, it looks to be partially

1781
02:40:01,894 --> 02:40:06,197
filled with ice at times. So as soon as it broke
away, you could see it's actually more of a harsh,

1782
02:40:06,197 --> 02:40:16,111
broken Dwarvish runic writing to it. The ship has
definitely seen a lot of wear and tear. That's

1783
02:40:16,154 --> 02:40:18,070
about as much you can make out of it.

1784
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:20,840
LAURA: Can we get inside of it? Is there anything
to see inside of it?

1785
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,922
MATT: You can attempt to climb inside if you want to.

1786
02:40:23,970 --> 02:40:25,289
MARISHA: How much is exposed right now?

1787
02:40:25,289 --> 02:40:31,449
MATT: Just the top of the deck, and where the
mast connects to the-- that portion is still

1788
02:40:31,449 --> 02:40:38,639
frozen into the upper part of the throne.
There is no entrance immediately visible, but you can

1789
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:42,564
break through some more ice or try to break
through the actual deck to get there.

1790
02:40:42,564 --> 02:40:46,979
MARISHA: I cast a Flaming Sphere.

1791
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:54,960
MATT: Okay. A flaming ball begins to roll on the
bridge of the ship.

1792
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:59,225
MARISHA: Where does it look like the most
convenient entrance? With ice and stuff?

1793
02:40:59,225 --> 02:41:05,756
MATT: Maybe four feet away from where the
ice begins. You can see there is one broken

1794
02:41:05,756 --> 02:41:11,546
portion of the ship deck, maybe about a three-foot,
four-foot hole that you could melt towards if

1795
02:41:11,546 --> 02:41:12,445
you wanted to.

1796
02:41:12,445 --> 02:41:15,069
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to concentrate my
Flaming Sphere on that and start melting it.

1797
02:41:15,101 --> 02:41:21,568
MATT: Okay. It's taking a while. About how long
does the spell last, the Flaming Sphere?

1798
02:41:21,568 --> 02:41:23,313
MARISHA: About a minute, I think?

1799
02:41:23,313 --> 02:41:31,418
LAURA: (hums the Jeopardy theme)

1800
02:41:31,418 --> 02:41:38,985
MATT: All right, Flaming Sphere, up to a minute,
yeah. The spell expires, the minute done, and you've

1801
02:41:38,985 --> 02:41:43,060
managed to melt maybe three inches into the ice?

1802
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:44,441
LAURA: Grog, go punch it.

1803
02:41:44,473 --> 02:41:45,754
MARISHA: How much was it?

1804
02:41:45,754 --> 02:41:47,090
MATT: About four feet of ice.

1805
02:41:47,090 --> 02:41:48,273
MARISHA: Oh, fuck that.

1806
02:41:48,273 --> 02:41:52,615
TRAVIS: Ugh! I got it.

1807
02:41:52,615 --> 02:41:54,011
MARISHA: I step back.

1808
02:41:54,011 --> 02:41:56,775
TRAVIS: And I start going Rocky-ribcage on this
big piece of meat.

1809
02:41:56,775 --> 02:41:59,103
MATT: Okay, make your strength check.

1810
02:41:59,103 --> 02:42:01,815
LAURA: Natural 20.

1811
02:42:01,815 --> 02:42:04,546
TRAVIS: 21.

1812
02:42:04,546 --> 02:42:15,126
MATT: 21. He continues to punch, and punch, and
punch, and each one you see the ice crack, pieces

1813
02:42:15,126 --> 02:42:22,217
of it break away. You get quite a ways to punching
through towards the direction that you are

1814
02:42:22,217 --> 02:42:27,828
currently melting before a lot of the ice crumbles
and falls and almost buries you for a second. But

1815
02:42:27,828 --> 02:42:34,559
you knock it away and pull yourself out of it as
you do, scooping the shards that occupied the

1816
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:36,352
space where you were and get out of the way.

1817
02:42:36,352 --> 02:42:40,376
MARISHA: I cast a Gust cantrip over top of
him to keep ice from falling on him.

1818
02:42:40,376 --> 02:42:42,882
LAURA: I hope there's really something in here.

1819
02:42:42,931 --> 02:42:43,839
MARISHA: Me too.

1820
02:42:43,839 --> 02:42:52,134
MATT: Keeps punching. You get to one point, and
you hit, and you hear a (dull impact). You watch a

1821
02:42:52,134 --> 02:42:57,287
crack spider up to the top of the throne.

1822
02:42:57,287 --> 02:43:03,577
TRAVIS: I think we need to go.

1823
02:43:03,577 --> 02:43:08,966
MATT: Portion of the throne above you is now
starting to crack and fall onto the side.

1824
02:43:08,966 --> 02:43:11,137
TRAVIS: I start running out of there.

1825
02:43:11,137 --> 02:43:13,196
LAURA: We should get out. Let's go.

1826
02:43:13,246 --> 02:43:14,853
MARISHA: I also back out.

1827
02:43:14,853 --> 02:43:19,402
MATT: Okay. I need the three of you who are
closest to it to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

1828
02:43:19,478 --> 02:43:24,748
TRAVIS: Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping?

1829
02:43:24,748 --> 02:43:32,865
MATT: You have advantage on dexterity, though.
You'll be fine.

1830
02:43:32,865 --> 02:43:37,838
LIAM: I could've hanged back, but I've been meaning to say 
this whole time that I was creeping around the thrones,

1831
02:43:37,838 --> 02:43:40,100
I'm just going to throw that out, that I'm up there.

1832
02:43:40,145 --> 02:43:46,724
MATT: Okay, so you see this happening. A portion
of it, like a whole half side of it has cracked

1833
02:43:46,724 --> 02:43:52,717
and is sliding down into the cavern that has been
excavated by your party and the Ravenites.

1834
02:43:52,717 --> 02:43:56,949
LIAM: So if I'm almost on it, should I be making a
dex save as well?

1835
02:43:57,005 --> 02:43:59,019
MATT: If you're almost on it--

1836
02:43:59,019 --> 02:44:00,953
LIAM: I was going to poke around and look around
it.

1837
02:44:00,953 --> 02:44:05,701
MATT: Only half of it's collapsing, I'll say
sure. Go for it. You who offers me to let you make

1838
02:44:05,701 --> 02:44:08,212
a dexterity saving throw, yes. I will take it.

1839
02:44:08,212 --> 02:44:10,210
LAURA: Really? Did you really do that?

1840
02:44:10,210 --> 02:44:14,314
LIAM: I rolled a one, but I have lots of Luck
left. And now I'm fine.

1841
02:44:14,357 --> 02:44:16,317
TRAVIS: I'm not.

1842
02:44:16,317 --> 02:44:17,608
LIAM: So that's a 26.

1843
02:44:17,608 --> 02:44:23,101
MATT: So yeah. You manage to leap off and
tumble in the snow to the bottom and don't have

1844
02:44:23,147 --> 02:44:24,675
to worry about it. Travis?

1845
02:44:24,675 --> 02:44:26,145
TRAVIS: Eight. With advantage.

1846
02:44:26,145 --> 02:44:27,163
LAURA: 29.

1847
02:44:27,163 --> 02:44:28,290
MARISHA: Eight.

1848
02:44:28,290 --> 02:44:34,920
TALIESIN: 19. But I burned a Resolve.

1849
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:40,888
MATT: So as you guys dart out, Grog and Keyleth
unfortunately are left a little bit behind. You

1850
02:44:40,888 --> 02:44:53,972
both are pummelled with chunks of hard ice and
jagged points of broken frost there, dealing 13

1851
02:44:53,972 --> 02:45:01,075
points of bludgeoning and piercing damage to both
of you. And you find yourselves partially buried

1852
02:45:01,075 --> 02:45:06,930
in the ice that cracks off it. You see most of
Keyleth's body is currently buried, just her head

1853
02:45:06,930 --> 02:45:12,252
and arms are out. And Grog, you're about up to
your waist now in broken ice and snow. And you're

1854
02:45:12,252 --> 02:45:15,588
like, (grunts), and pull yourself out.

1855
02:45:15,588 --> 02:45:17,174
TRAVIS: Look at Keyleth's arm.

1856
02:45:17,174 --> 02:45:18,833
LAURA: Yeah, I see it. Can you get her out?

1857
02:45:18,833 --> 02:45:21,227
TRAVIS: Okay. I start moving the ice and pull her
out.

1858
02:45:21,227 --> 02:45:23,642
MATT: You pull Keyleth out.

1859
02:45:23,642 --> 02:45:25,281
MARISHA: (coughing)

1860
02:45:25,281 --> 02:45:26,866
TRAVIS: That didn't go well.

1861
02:45:26,866 --> 02:45:32,731
TALIESIN: Let's burrow straight into the side, I
think, to be on the safe side. Let's stop melting ice.

1862
02:45:32,731 --> 02:45:35,871
LAURA: Isn't it buried completely at this point?

1863
02:45:35,871 --> 02:45:41,116
MATT: At this point, the entire excavation
portion-- by the way, as you guys came back, most

1864
02:45:41,116 --> 02:45:46,110
of the gold and platinum that was in there has
been completely removed by the Ravenites over

1865
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:51,343
time. And this whole area that has been excavated
so carefully left it in a precarious place. Those

1866
02:45:51,343 --> 02:46:00,333
physical hits by Grog sent that whole south side
of the throne to collapse inwards. So it's

1867
02:46:00,333 --> 02:46:06,705
partially collapsed. There's a large pile of ice,
rock and snow. And it's not very accessible from

1868
02:46:06,705 --> 02:46:08,204
the current standpoint.

1869
02:46:08,204 --> 02:46:13,796
LAURA: Maybe it was one of Vorugal's first
kills or something? And it's sentimental?

1870
02:46:13,845 --> 02:46:16,134
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm irritated by it.

1871
02:46:16,134 --> 02:46:19,829
LIAM: I think it might have given him a little bit
of juice when he was at home.

1872
02:46:19,829 --> 02:46:23,389
MARISHA: Do you think it has some sort of
icy-like--

1873
02:46:23,389 --> 02:46:27,289
LIAM: Extra ability when he was here, maybe.

1874
02:46:27,289 --> 02:46:30,408
MARISHA: I could try, and maybe now that the ice
is broken I can melt it through it easier?

1875
02:46:30,442 --> 02:46:32,666
LIAM: Why would a dragon keep a boat?

1876
02:46:32,666 --> 02:46:34,122
TALIESIN: Why would he?

1877
02:46:34,122 --> 02:46:37,141
TRAVIS: Maybe his woobie, you know--?

1878
02:46:37,141 --> 02:46:38,679
LAURA: Like a blankie.

1879
02:46:38,679 --> 02:46:41,290
LIAM: Yeah. You know about that, Percy?

1880
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:45,156
MARISHA: Some people like collecting ships, you
know? Maybe he's a nautical kind of guy.

1881
02:46:45,156 --> 02:46:46,555
TRAVIS: Yeah, guns and ships.

1882
02:46:46,555 --> 02:46:48,296
LAURA: He was a nautical kind of guy.

1883
02:46:48,296 --> 02:46:49,470
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

1884
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:53,481
TRAVIS: (hums the intro of "Alexander Hamilton")

1885
02:46:53,481 --> 02:46:59,083
LIAM: While we're all standing here with our
thumbs in our butts, could I look around and see

1886
02:46:59,083 --> 02:47:02,919
if I see a little stone, a little palantir?

1887
02:47:02,919 --> 02:47:04,438
MATT: Make a investigation check.

1888
02:47:04,438 --> 02:47:06,489
SAM: Where are you standing?

1889
02:47:06,489 --> 02:47:09,443
LIAM: Ugh, Luck again. Jeepers creepers.

1890
02:47:09,443 --> 02:47:10,659
LAURA: He's up top.

1891
02:47:10,659 --> 02:47:13,926
SAM: If he's up top, I would have been up there
with him, too.

1892
02:47:13,926 --> 02:47:15,087
LIAM: 26.

1893
02:47:15,087 --> 02:47:18,572
SAM: I'm a crow. Circling around, watching him
from above.

1894
02:47:18,572 --> 02:47:19,686
LIAM: I'm invisible.

1895
02:47:19,686 --> 02:47:22,086
SAM: Well, I'm watching the area.

1896
02:47:22,086 --> 02:47:29,363
MATT: All right. What did you roll? 26? Yeah. You
see within the north side of the throne, there are

1897
02:47:29,363 --> 02:47:35,867
two orbs embedded in the ice, about a foot beneath
the surface. Previously you saw more.

1898
02:47:35,867 --> 02:47:41,363
LIAM: In the past, in other locations, you mean?

1899
02:47:41,363 --> 02:47:52,444
MATT: No, meaning when you guys first came to this
when he wasn't there, you saw three stones. You now see two.

1900
02:47:52,487 --> 02:47:57,384
But half of the throne has collapsed as well.

1901
02:47:57,384 --> 02:48:03,919
LIAM: And how far down are they under the ice?

1902
02:48:03,919 --> 02:48:06,778
MATT: About a foot, a foot and a half from the
surface.

1903
02:48:06,778 --> 02:48:09,884
MARISHA: Never mind.

1904
02:48:09,884 --> 02:48:13,284
LIAM: I'm going to go find my sister.

1905
02:48:13,284 --> 02:48:16,709
LAURA: (groans) It's--

1906
02:48:16,709 --> 02:48:19,289
LIAM: Hey! I'm invisible! Here I am.

1907
02:48:19,289 --> 02:48:20,914
LAURA and LIAM: Hi.

1908
02:48:20,914 --> 02:48:22,151
LAURA: Did you see it? It collapsed.

1909
02:48:22,151 --> 02:48:24,364
LIAM: Yes, I saw it. I dodged out of the way.

1910
02:48:24,364 --> 02:48:25,265
LAURA: Good.

1911
02:48:25,265 --> 02:48:27,034
LIAM: I'm right here.

1912
02:48:27,034 --> 02:48:28,314
LAURA: I know! I'm looking at you.

1913
02:48:28,314 --> 02:48:29,753
LIAM: Yes, but I'm invisible.

1914
02:48:29,753 --> 02:48:31,365
LAURA: I'm looking in your direction.

1915
02:48:31,365 --> 02:48:32,823
LIAM: Boop!

1916
02:48:32,823 --> 02:48:34,082
LAURA: Ugh, goddamn it.

1917
02:48:34,082 --> 02:48:38,153
LIAM: Remember those little round seeing stones?

1918
02:48:38,153 --> 02:48:39,250
LAURA: Yeah.

1919
02:48:39,250 --> 02:48:42,480
LIAM: There's a couple under the ice over there. Now,
I was invisible so I don't--

1920
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:43,803
LAURA: You saw them under the ice?

1921
02:48:43,803 --> 02:48:44,725
LIAM: Yeah.

1922
02:48:44,725 --> 02:48:45,943
LAURA: You saw a couple under the ice?

1923
02:48:45,943 --> 02:48:47,391
LIAM: A couple under the ice, a foot or two away.

1924
02:48:47,391 --> 02:48:50,521
LAURA: Where were the other ones?

1925
02:48:50,521 --> 02:48:52,159
LIAM: I didn't see any other ones.

1926
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:55,044
LAURA: Were they there before it collapsed?

1927
02:48:55,044 --> 02:49:00,465
LIAM: I don't know. I was standing right beneath
the throne when the throne collapsed. Then I found them.

1928
02:49:00,465 --> 02:49:05,551
LAURA and LIAM: Were they near the area that it
collapsed?

1929
02:49:05,551 --> 02:49:07,953
MATT and LIAM: One of them was, yeah.

1930
02:49:07,953 --> 02:49:11,905
LAURA, MARISHA, TALIESIN, and TRAVIS: Fuck!

1931
02:49:11,905 --> 02:49:13,065
LIAM: Fucking--

1932
02:49:13,065 --> 02:49:14,086
SAM: (caws)

1933
02:49:14,086 --> 02:49:26,407
MARISHA: Hold on, did we maybe get-- is Thordak
going to-- we should go.

1934
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:28,511
LAURA: Fuck!

1935
02:49:28,511 --> 02:49:32,190
MARISHA: Percy, want to leave a mark anymore?

1936
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:33,922
LAURA: We should tell Tooma that--

1937
02:49:33,922 --> 02:49:35,223
TALIESIN: We left one.

1938
02:49:35,223 --> 02:49:37,027
LAURA: I go find Tooma.

1939
02:49:37,027 --> 02:49:46,215
MATT: The handful of dragonborn that were there,
after the collapse, were walking back to the

1940
02:49:46,215 --> 02:49:53,964
internal cavern area. As you head back, a large
portion of Ravenites have all come out of their

1941
02:49:53,964 --> 02:50:02,595
caves, and right now are in the process of
scouring the ruins. Some of them are putting

1942
02:50:02,595 --> 02:50:06,753
armaments away. Tooma is out there, currently
conversing with a number of the other community

1943
02:50:06,753 --> 02:50:08,989
leaders that are deciding what the next steps
are.

1944
02:50:08,989 --> 02:50:18,361
MARISHA: I approach Tooma. (clears throat) Tooma,
it's time that we make our departure very soon.

1945
02:50:18,361 --> 02:50:20,005
MATT: "Very well."

1946
02:50:20,005 --> 02:50:24,050
MARISHA: I want to thank you so much for
everything that you provided and everything that

1947
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:25,390
your people have done.

1948
02:50:25,390 --> 02:50:31,741
MATT: "I wish to thank you for your sticking to
your word."

1949
02:50:31,741 --> 02:50:40,893
MARISHA: Of course. I would love to help and leave
some parting gift in any way that I can.

1950
02:50:40,893 --> 02:50:50,666
MATT: "The riches from the hoard will provide
enough for us. You need not worry."

1951
02:50:50,666 --> 02:50:56,362
MARISHA: What was your land like before Vorugal
got here? I know it wasn't as icy and as frigid.

1952
02:50:56,362 --> 02:51:07,913
MATT: "It was without snow. We are at the
south side of Wildemount. I hope this fades with

1953
02:51:07,957 --> 02:51:10,475
"time, we are not bound for snow people."

1954
02:51:10,475 --> 02:51:18,583
MARISHA: I can attempt to maybe revitalize your
plant life as much as I can before I leave.

1955
02:51:18,583 --> 02:51:20,586
MATT: "You can do this?"

1956
02:51:20,586 --> 02:51:22,151
MARISHA: I can.

1957
02:51:22,151 --> 02:51:27,216
MATT: "By all means. We would appreciate it."

1958
02:51:27,216 --> 02:51:36,276
MARISHA: You have a good, strong people and I
want to see your recovery. Just like I hope the

1959
02:51:36,276 --> 02:51:37,729
same with mine.

1960
02:51:37,729 --> 02:51:39,850
MATT: "Me too."

1961
02:51:39,850 --> 02:51:42,091
MARISHA: Anything that I can do.

1962
02:51:42,091 --> 02:51:43,167
LAURA: Tooma?

1963
02:51:43,167 --> 02:51:44,752
MATT: "Yes?"

1964
02:51:44,752 --> 02:51:47,790
LAURA: You know the stones we talked about?

1965
02:51:47,790 --> 02:51:50,657
MATT: "Yes."

1966
02:51:50,657 --> 02:51:52,282
LAURA: Yeah, they got jostled.

1967
02:51:52,282 --> 02:51:54,312
MATT: "Why?"

1968
02:51:54,312 --> 02:51:59,308
LAURA: It looks like that ice wasn't super-strong,
and it collapsed.

1969
02:51:59,308 --> 02:52:03,124
TALIESIN: The ice was going to collapse
eventually, anyway.

1970
02:52:03,124 --> 02:52:04,883
MATT: "What does this mean?"

1971
02:52:04,883 --> 02:52:06,900
LAURA: Not sure exactly.

1972
02:52:06,900 --> 02:52:08,356
MATT: "Okay."

1973
02:52:08,356 --> 02:52:18,372
LAURA: But you should keep an eye on the sky. If you
see something red, maybe hide. Just for a while.

1974
02:52:18,372 --> 02:52:25,026
Thordak doesn't know what was here. But if he
realizes Vorugal's been killed, he'll come

1975
02:52:25,026 --> 02:52:26,617
looking. Potentially.

1976
02:52:26,617 --> 02:52:28,855
MATT: "But you're going to kill this Thordak,
yes?"

1977
02:52:28,855 --> 02:52:34,871
LAURA: Oh, yeah! With your help, I think. Just in
case he comes before we get to him.

1978
02:52:34,871 --> 02:52:37,120
MATT: "You should get to him quickly, then."

1979
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,970
LAURA: Good plan.

1980
02:52:38,970 --> 02:52:39,828
MATT: "Good."

1981
02:52:39,828 --> 02:52:42,813
LIAM: The whole time she's been talking, her braid
has been going like a magical jump rope because I'm

1982
02:52:42,813 --> 02:52:45,111
standing here doing this with it.

1983
02:52:45,157 --> 02:52:46,850
LAURA: Not. The time.

1984
02:52:46,850 --> 02:52:49,546
TALIESIN: If you find something--

1985
02:52:49,546 --> 02:52:52,181
LAURA: (whispers) Fucking dick! Stop it!

1986
02:52:52,181 --> 02:53:03,517
TALIESIN: If you find an ice weapon in that ship
beneath the throne-- anything magical, some sort

1987
02:53:03,517 --> 02:53:09,075
of ice power, we may need it. That may be useful.

1988
02:53:09,075 --> 02:53:11,693
MATT: "Keep in mind for it."

1989
02:53:11,693 --> 02:53:22,789
MARISHA: I go up to the group. Percy, Vax, I need
to take time with this, so are you all all right

1990
02:53:22,789 --> 02:53:25,683
spending the rest of the day here while I help
them?

1991
02:53:25,683 --> 02:53:27,160
LAURA: Of course.

1992
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:28,331
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1993
02:53:28,331 --> 02:53:36,747
MARISHA: All right. I ascend to the top of the
ravine and I start meditating, and I cast Plant Growth.

1994
02:53:36,747 --> 02:53:40,348
LAURA: We all need to go up there anyway because
that's where the trees are that we're going to

1995
02:53:40,348 --> 02:53:41,924
transport through, right?

1996
02:53:41,924 --> 02:53:42,896
MARISHA: Yeah.

1997
02:53:42,896 --> 02:53:44,120
LAURA: We make our way to the top of the ravine
as well.

1998
02:53:44,155 --> 02:53:45,491
MATT: What level is Plant Growth?

1999
02:53:45,491 --> 02:53:46,468
MARISHA: Third.

2000
02:53:46,468 --> 02:53:47,419
MATT: 3rd-level. Gotcha.

2001
02:53:47,419 --> 02:53:49,219
MARISHA: And I'm doing the eight-hour--

2002
02:53:49,219 --> 02:53:50,289
LAURA: Eight hours!

2003
02:53:50,289 --> 02:53:51,680
MATT: Boy, guys!

2004
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:53,556
SAM: Super boring day for us.

2005
02:53:53,607 --> 02:53:55,123
MARISHA: Yep. Sorry.

2006
02:53:55,123 --> 02:53:58,167
TALIESIN: God, I want to get in that ship!

2007
02:53:58,167 --> 02:54:08,325
MARISHA: I start doing that and revitalizing their
landscape as close to what it was before, giving

2008
02:54:08,325 --> 02:54:11,335
their-- [no audio]

2009
02:54:11,335 --> 02:54:16,800
MATT: It affects all normal plants within a
hundred-foot radius. So you have a very specific

2010
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:18,937
portion that you revitalize in the ravine.

2011
02:54:18,937 --> 02:54:22,286
MARISHA: Okay. Well, I talked to Tooma and find
out where she--

2012
02:54:22,286 --> 02:54:24,630
MATT: Actually, no, all plants in a
half-mile radius are--

2013
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:28,605
MARISHA: That's what I thought, yeah. In the eight
hour one that's like, crazy.

2014
02:54:28,605 --> 02:54:34,764
MATT: I should have kept reading. Okay, so yeah.
You talk to her about it, and she tells you,

2015
02:54:34,764 --> 02:54:43,062
"The ravine itself does not have the nutrients to
support crops, but we had farmland right

2016
02:54:43,062 --> 02:54:44,459
"above the ravine."

2017
02:54:44,459 --> 02:54:47,845
MARISHA: All right. Do you plan to still reside
there?

2018
02:54:47,845 --> 02:54:49,348
MATT: "Once the snow melts, yes."

2019
02:54:49,348 --> 02:54:51,347
MARISHA: I'll do what I can. And I go there.

2020
02:54:51,347 --> 02:54:56,655
MATT: Okay. You get there, and through the use of
your elemental magics, you easily cast aside the

2021
02:54:56,655 --> 02:55:01,959
snow. And from underneath, you can see where once
there was a heavy amount of cropland that has all

2022
02:55:01,959 --> 02:55:07,211
died off because of the recent freeze that came
with Vorugal. You take the eight hours to

2023
02:55:07,211 --> 02:55:11,423
concentrate and as you, do you enrich the land. You
can watch as many of these dead seeds come to life

2024
02:55:11,423 --> 02:55:19,930
with green once more. Suddenly, you see sprouting
bits of delicious cabbages and other forms of

2025
02:55:19,930 --> 02:55:26,240
produce begin to spring to life and grow nutrient
rich. As this happens, you can see a few of the

2026
02:55:26,274 --> 02:55:31,768
Ravenites who followed you to watch this are taken
aback and excitedly rush down to tell the rest of

2027
02:55:31,768 --> 02:55:35,034
the people. The rest of you are bored out of your
mind for the next eight hours.

2028
02:55:35,034 --> 02:55:37,746
TRAVIS: Kima and I are sparring.

2029
02:55:37,746 --> 02:55:42,659
SAM: Challenge Vax to a peeing in the snow
contest.

2030
02:55:42,659 --> 02:55:44,981
MATT: He's had a lot of wine.

2031
02:55:44,981 --> 02:55:49,006
LIAM: Oh yeah, that was last night.

2032
02:55:49,006 --> 02:55:51,062
LAURA: So you're pretty hungover, you don't have a
lot.

2033
02:55:51,062 --> 02:55:52,299
SAM: Distance and accuracy.

2034
02:55:52,299 --> 02:55:54,996
LIAM: (sings a fanfare) I've brought one
from your house.

2035
02:55:54,996 --> 02:55:56,337
SAM: It's gone.

2036
02:55:56,337 --> 02:55:57,648
LAURA: It disappeared.

2037
02:55:57,648 --> 02:55:58,934
LIAM: Damn it!

2038
02:55:58,934 --> 02:56:00,630
MATT: Yes, as you reach for it, there's nothing
there.

2039
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:07,406
LAURA: That's amazing.

2040
02:56:07,406 --> 02:56:11,637
MATT: So you guys have fun sparring for a while,
you beat the crap out of each other off and on for

2041
02:56:11,683 --> 02:56:17,355
a few hours and you both feel good about it. When
the eight hours have finished, you guys reconvene.

2042
02:56:17,355 --> 02:56:21,498
LIAM: V-A-X. Your turn.

2043
02:56:21,498 --> 02:56:24,297
MARISHA: Vax is shorter than Scanlan.

2044
02:56:24,297 --> 02:56:25,922
TRAVIS: Cursive, baby.

2045
02:56:25,922 --> 02:56:30,314
MATT: I want both of you guys to make performance
checks

2046
02:56:30,314 --> 02:56:32,634
SAM: Okay.

2047
02:56:32,679 --> 02:56:34,290
Performance for peeing in the snow.

2048
02:56:34,290 --> 02:56:37,655
LAURA: Oh, what what. He's got a really high
modifier, though.

2049
02:56:37,655 --> 02:56:39,054
LIAM: Oh, I'm sure he'll win.

2050
02:56:39,054 --> 02:56:40,621
TALIESIN: No, you're going to win.

2051
02:56:40,621 --> 02:56:41,989
SAM: Not good.

2052
02:56:41,989 --> 02:56:44,253
LIAM: No, even at his lowest it'll be higher I
bet.

2053
02:56:44,253 --> 02:56:44,898
SAM: 18.

2054
02:56:44,898 --> 02:56:45,874
LIAM: 21.

2055
02:56:45,874 --> 02:56:47,170
MATT: You want to add your d12?

2056
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:48,104
LIAM: Zorro.

2057
02:56:48,104 --> 02:56:50,801
MATT: You can add your own bardic inspiration.

2058
02:56:50,801 --> 02:56:52,240
LIAM: Yeah, if he thinks of it.

2059
02:56:52,240 --> 02:56:53,608
SAM: It's a fair fight.

2060
02:56:53,608 --> 02:56:54,643
MATT: Okay, okay.

2061
02:56:54,643 --> 02:56:55,727
SAM: This is a fair fight.

2062
02:56:55,727 --> 02:57:02,720
MATT: It is close, but as much as your cursive
writing was on point, it was impressive that Vax

2063
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:08,313
was capable of cursive drawing the X, stopping and
then crossing the X.

2064
02:57:08,313 --> 02:57:09,955
SAM: Whoa.

2065
02:57:09,955 --> 02:57:12,676
TRAVIS: It stings when you stop.

2066
02:57:12,676 --> 02:57:17,795
SAM: That's impressive, but you know my wang is
built for power, not accuracy.

2067
02:57:17,795 --> 02:57:25,459
LAURA: As soon as the cube comes out: can I talk
to you, do you mind stepping away?

2068
02:57:25,459 --> 02:57:27,022
TRAVIS: With the cube out?

2069
02:57:27,022 --> 02:57:28,318
SAM: You talking to me?

2070
02:57:28,318 --> 02:57:29,390
LAURA: No, not you.

2071
02:57:29,390 --> 02:57:35,614
TALIESIN: Sure, yeah, I'm going to do nothing but
stare at that bloody ship if I don't, so sure.

2072
02:57:35,614 --> 02:57:40,453
LAURA: How are you, after dying?

2073
02:57:40,453 --> 02:57:54,846
TALIESIN: I'm trying really hard not to think
about it, actually. I don't know, honestly. There

2074
02:57:54,846 --> 02:57:57,482
hasn't been a lot of time to process.

2075
02:57:57,482 --> 02:58:00,814
LAURA: No, there hasn't. It's a lot in a few days.

2076
02:58:00,814 --> 02:58:07,514
TALIESIN: I would say it would be nice to be going
home, except I know what we're going home to. So

2077
02:58:07,514 --> 02:58:09,085
there's going to be no relief.

2078
02:58:09,085 --> 02:58:11,910
LAURA: No, not for a while, I don't think.

2079
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:15,442
TALIESIN: That creature hanging around.

2080
02:58:15,442 --> 02:58:17,403
LAURA: Yes.

2081
02:58:17,403 --> 02:58:21,046
TALIESIN: Yeah, death was not pleasant.

2082
02:58:21,046 --> 02:58:30,181
LAURA: No. I have to tell you something

2083
02:58:30,181 --> 02:58:34,721
TALIESIN: All right.

2084
02:58:34,721 --> 02:58:41,618
LAURA: Do you know what Fenthras means?

2085
02:58:41,618 --> 02:58:44,211
TALIESIN: I don't, actually.

2086
02:58:44,211 --> 02:58:49,990
LAURA: It comes from the Elvish words, I'm
surprised. Growth and protection.

2087
02:58:49,990 --> 02:58:57,351
TALIESIN: I would've eventually looked it up. It's
the sort of terribly boring thing I would do.

2088
02:58:57,351 --> 02:59:04,754
LAURA: It's odd that Saundor had it for so long,
since he was quite the opposite of that, don't you think?

2089
02:59:04,754 --> 02:59:10,997
TALIESIN: I tend to think that many people tend to
exalt the exact opposite of what they are.

2090
02:59:10,997 --> 02:59:24,456
LAURA: Yes. I don't know, I think he focused for
so long on the betrayal of his love, on all of the

2091
02:59:24,456 --> 02:59:35,461
horrible things within himself that caused that,
that he became the physical embodiment of it. And

2092
02:59:35,461 --> 02:59:46,471
I think he was trying to do the same thing to me. Even
though I refused him, I could feel those seeds

2093
02:59:46,471 --> 03:00:00,946
being planted. Self-doubt and loathing echoing in
my mind every night. Reliving every wrong that

2094
03:00:00,946 --> 03:00:04,013
people have done to me and everything I have done.

2095
03:00:04,013 --> 03:00:14,805
TALIESIN: I recently-- I will say, before death-- had a 
bit of an epiphany, and have been trying--

2096
03:00:14,805 --> 03:00:20,209
not always succeeding, but trying-- not to 
dwell on such things.

2097
03:00:20,209 --> 03:00:25,506
LAURA: That's actually what I wanted to talk to
you about. In the fight with Ripley.

2098
03:00:25,506 --> 03:00:26,763
TALIESIN: Yes.

2099
03:00:26,763 --> 03:00:31,273
LAURA: Your last words to her were, "I forgive
you."

2100
03:00:31,273 --> 03:00:33,480
TALIESIN: Yes.

2101
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:36,042
LAURA: It was such a surprise.

2102
03:00:36,042 --> 03:00:37,649
TALIESIN: Yes.

2103
03:00:37,649 --> 03:00:43,746
LAURA: I pull out Fenthras and I show him what
I've carved onto it, it's "sinaeth." Do you know

2104
03:00:43,746 --> 03:00:44,946
that word?

2105
03:00:44,946 --> 03:00:46,416
TALIESIN: How common is that word?

2106
03:00:46,416 --> 03:00:48,058
MATT: You know the word.

2107
03:00:48,058 --> 03:00:49,144
TALIESIN: I would know the word.

2108
03:00:49,144 --> 03:00:50,391
LAURA: It's forgive.

2109
03:00:50,391 --> 03:00:51,663
TALIESIN: Oh.

2110
03:00:51,663 --> 03:01:01,727
LAURA: I carved this on Fenthras because that's
the key, isn't it? It's the only way to really grow.

2111
03:01:01,727 --> 03:01:15,605
TALIESIN: I think so. I'm trying. It's the only
thing I've tried that's made any sense so far. And

2112
03:01:15,605 --> 03:01:31,209
it felt very liberating, it felt good, it felt
perfect. And it wasn't about her. It was just

2113
03:01:31,209 --> 03:01:38,025
about me. Honestly, that was really the thing that
I noticed, was I didn't say it to make her feel

2114
03:01:38,025 --> 03:01:47,158
better, I didn't say it to give her any peace. I
came to that feeling before running into her. I

2115
03:01:47,158 --> 03:02:00,504
didn't know if it would be true when I saw her,
but I feel like so much of my energy had been such

2116
03:02:00,504 --> 03:02:08,768
a waste. And worse than a waste, it had been
twisted in the wrong direction. And it's too late

2117
03:02:08,768 --> 03:02:12,841
for a lot of things. There are things I cannot
take back and things that I have done that will

2118
03:02:12,841 --> 03:02:18,207
forever be terrible, but that's not the point, I
suppose.

2119
03:02:18,207 --> 03:02:25,030
LAURA: It isn't. Whoever that boy was that created
those things, that suffered such horrors that he

2120
03:02:25,030 --> 03:02:35,799
felt they were justified? You have to forgive him,
too. Because everything you've suffered and

2121
03:02:35,799 --> 03:02:42,645
endured and created in that time has made you into
the person you are now. And you have a brilliant

2122
03:02:42,645 --> 03:02:54,319
mind. And any darkness that might cloud your
vision on occasion, the fact that you found it

2123
03:02:54,319 --> 03:02:58,939
within yourself to forgive her means that it will
never overtake you.

2124
03:02:58,939 --> 03:03:11,467
TALIESIN: Thank you. I would like to think we're
all better than we think we are. Except maybe

2125
03:03:11,467 --> 03:03:13,169
your brother. I think he's just a mess.

2126
03:03:13,169 --> 03:03:15,056
LAURA: He's terrible, isn't he? Just the worst.

2127
03:03:15,056 --> 03:03:16,482
TALIESIN: Is he in here?

2128
03:03:16,482 --> 03:03:19,290
LAURA: Maybe, he's probably hiding somewhere.

2129
03:03:19,290 --> 03:03:28,880
TALIESIN: Shouldn't have given him that ring.
Thank you. I know I have to forgive myself. I'm

2130
03:03:28,880 --> 03:03:43,619
not quite there yet, but I can see a path. I like
where we are and what we're doing. I think that

2131
03:03:43,619 --> 03:03:47,775
we're the right people in the right place and the
right time.

2132
03:03:47,775 --> 03:03:59,327
LAURA: I agree. And this engraving is a reminder
that every time I attack, it's not out of

2133
03:03:59,327 --> 03:04:00,882
vengeance.

2134
03:04:00,882 --> 03:04:04,235
TALIESIN: I would be horrified if you were taking
yourself too seriously.

2135
03:04:04,235 --> 03:04:09,514
LAURA: Never. Did you see the bear that I carved
on the tree? It's quite lovely.

2136
03:04:09,514 --> 03:04:14,768
TALIESIN: It was quite lovely. I don't know if the
tree is quite as happy with it, but I was quite

2137
03:04:14,768 --> 03:04:16,066
impressed.

2138
03:04:16,066 --> 03:04:22,355
LAURA: Thank you.

2139
03:04:22,355 --> 03:04:29,674
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2140
03:04:29,717 --> 03:04:35,281
LAURA: That's all.

2141
03:04:35,281 --> 03:04:42,318
TALIESIN: What room are we in, out of curiosity?

2142
03:04:42,318 --> 03:04:44,629
LAURA: There's no room, we're in the woods.

2143
03:04:44,629 --> 03:04:52,917
TALIESIN: Oh, no room, we're in the woods. Yeah,
all right. As I walk away, I walk up.

2144
03:04:52,917 --> 03:04:56,123
I kiss her.

2145
03:04:56,123 --> 03:04:58,517
So we'll talk later. And I walk away.

2146
03:04:58,517 --> 03:05:02,437
LIAM: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.

2147
03:05:02,437 --> 03:05:05,357
TALIESIN: Bless you.

2148
03:05:05,357 --> 03:05:07,277
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh shit!

2149
03:05:07,277 --> 03:05:09,607
MATT: And it's ten o'clock. We're going to go
ahead and end today's session.

2150
03:05:09,607 --> 03:05:11,608
TALIESIN: Bam, motherfuckers! Bam!

2151
03:05:11,608 --> 03:05:21,221
TRAVIS: (singing) Go on and kiss the girl.

2152
03:05:21,221 --> 03:05:26,139
LAURA: Oh man, oh man.

2153
03:05:26,139 --> 03:05:32,743
MATT: Thank you guys for watching! That episode 
had a lot of interesting moments.

2154
03:05:32,743 --> 03:05:34,841
SAM: We had an elephant fight.

2155
03:05:34,841 --> 03:05:37,382
(laughter)

2156
03:05:37,382 --> 03:05:40,228
MATT: The spoils of war.

2157
03:05:40,228 --> 03:05:42,030
TRAVIS: A whole bunch of new shit.

2158
03:05:42,030 --> 03:05:46,311
LIAM: Look at our signatures in the snow, that's
fucking beautiful!

2159
03:05:46,311 --> 03:05:49,004
TALIESIN: There was pissing, there was kissing,
there was everything!

2160
03:05:49,004 --> 03:05:50,611
SAM: Pissing and kissing.

2161
03:05:50,611 --> 03:05:53,815
TALIESIN: Pissing and Kissing is the title.

2162
03:05:53,815 --> 03:05:55,556
MARISHA: That's a good title.

2163
03:05:55,556 --> 03:05:59,371
MATT: That is <i>not</i> going to be the title.

2164
03:05:59,371 --> 03:06:02,373
LIAM: I shit it.

2165
03:06:02,373 --> 03:06:03,847
TALIESIN: You're welcome, Internet.

2166
03:06:03,847 --> 03:06:08,814
MATT: Well then. We'll get ourselves to rest for
the evening. You guys do the same, thank you for

2167
03:06:08,814 --> 03:06:13,760
hanging in there. Once again, amazing community,
we love you guys so much, all the support you

2168
03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:18,756
have. Make sure to dig into all the awesome
charities that we support, and you guys support as

2169
03:06:18,756 --> 03:06:24,109
well. We're continuously getting messages from
them, blown away by the generosity of the Critter

2170
03:06:24,109 --> 03:06:29,294
and Team Hooman community, so thank you guys so
much for your support on those.

2171
03:06:29,294 --> 03:06:32,149
LAURA: Thank you, Backblaze.

2172
03:06:32,149 --> 03:06:35,154
ALL: Thanks, Backblaze!

2173
03:06:35,154 --> 03:06:40,654
TRAVIS: That amazing commercial. They're always so
good.

2174
03:06:40,654 --> 03:06:47,707
MATT: I guess until next week, guys. Is it
Thursday yet? See you then.

2175
03:06:47,707 --> 03:06:50,230
TRAVIS: Oh shit, man!
