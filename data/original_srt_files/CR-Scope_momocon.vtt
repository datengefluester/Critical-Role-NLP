NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:12.821
[intense music]

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:18.892
(applause)

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:27.004
MATT: Good morning, everyone. Whoa! There we go, I
think we're good?

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.195
MARY: Good morning!

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.756
MATT: Morning!

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:32.643
MARY: How do you want to do this?

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:40.058
MATT: I saw you were repping with this shirt. It
made me happy. Yeah, both of our schedules on our

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:45.063
badges said this was the main stage. So if
you have any friends that are there, let them know

00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:50.116
that they're in the wrong place. And that it's
okay because we were also at the wrong place. We

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:54.012
almost fought for it, too. There were Guild Wars
folks there and we were like: Whose panel is this?

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.702
Are you sure?

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:57.504
MARY: Smackdown backstage.

00:00:57.504 --> 00:01:04.604
MATT: It almost happened. So welcome to our
Saturday morning-ish, near noonish Critical Role panel!

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:07.729
(applause)

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.340
MATT: Glad you guys could join us. Who here hasn't
seen the show?

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.586
MARY: Awesome! Oh, great!

00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:20.675
MATT: Fantastic! So careful with spoilers.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:23.805
(alarm beeping)

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:36.613
MATT: (explosion) Sorry, I just assume that's what
follows that sound. We're a show of a bunch of

00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:42.157
voice actors that sit around, roll dice, and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons like the long-term basement

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:50.660
nerds we are; it's awesome. That's pretty much the
show! Once a week on Twitch we'll get together and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.197
continue to game and people show up and watch us
and it's really amazing. I don't really know how

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:01.374
it happened, but you guys are incredible and the
community that's come out of this is continuously

00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:04.547
blowing me away. So a round of applause for you
guys.

00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:09.192
(applause)

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:11.428
MARY: I don't know who did it!

00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:16.934
MATT: We've got mood lighting now, heck yeah. And
the ominous countdown in the corner.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:22.213
MARY: I know! We have to solve this puzzle.

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:29.240
MATT: So if we have that going like the '24' sound
through the whole panel it'd be great!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.605
MARY: That'd be terrifying.

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:32.341
MATT: We should start with intros. Mary.

00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:37.252
MARY: Hi, I'm Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, and I had
never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons until Matt asked

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:48.784
me onto Critical Role and I played a tiefling
warlock named Zahra. I have two kill shots, one on

00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:56.354
Rimefang, poor sucker. And a beholder, much to
Vex's-- I vexed Vex with two kill shots. Laura

00:02:56.354 --> 00:03:01.304
Bailey is very mad at me. It's her birthday today,
so get on board and-- actually, it's Liam and

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:06.823
Laura's birthday today, so tweet them. The twins'
birthday.

00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:09.666
MATT: That's actually how they came up with the
idea to make their characters twins is because

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:12.148
they share a birthday and I said, well, that's
convenient.

00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:17.075
MARY: So I'd never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I
had no idea. I've taken a lot of theater and I

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:23.514
didn't realize-- I think I was intimidated by it
because the kids I knew growing up were really--

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:30.265
They kept to themselves and were this really
quiet, shy group and I was a bit louder and with a

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:36.845
louder group of nerds and they were a quieter
group of nerds. So we never really crossed borders

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:41.515
and they'd play D&amp;D all the time. I don't know
what that is and it's freaking me out a little bit

00:03:41.515 --> 00:03:47.623
until I realized it's just improv with dice
rolling to see how well your improv goes. And I

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:54.194
thought: That's brilliant! These were the probably
the most creative people I could've known and I

00:03:54.194 --> 00:03:59.744
didn't get a chance to know them, and now I do. I
just love the idea that it is one of the most

00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:07.356
creative things you can do, and what's come out of
it: the fan art, the fan shipping, all the stuff

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:12.756
that's happening. And Kash and Zee are <i>not</i> an
item, let's put it out there now.

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:17.223
MATT: We have built Tumblr trash! Yes!

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:29.942
MARY: Yes! First of all, to watch this guy in
action is just amazing! Unbelievable! Amazing!

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:35.068
I've been directing Matt for years and I had <i>no</i>
idea. I was like: I'm so intimidated to direct you

00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:38.150
now. (laughs)

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.032
MATT: It is a weird reversal. For most of my life
it's been: Oh, don't let them know you play

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.202
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:47.090
MARY: How long have you been playing?

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.464
MATT: I've been playing since my freshman of high
school, so 20 years this year.

00:04:52.464 --> 00:04:53.915
MARY: Wow!

00:04:53.915 --> 00:05:01.023
MATT: I've been playing longer than some of you
have been alive! Oh God!

00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:05.080
MARY: What was the first character you rolled?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.324
MATT: That hit me harder than I expected.

00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:11.408
MARY: It's true, though. Terrifying.

00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:16.032
MATT: First character I ever made, I was invited
to the game and I didn't know much about the

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:20.669
logistics of it, but I wanted to be a wizard,
because magic practitioners sound like a really

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.692
cool idea, and so I made a wizard. This was Second
Edition D&amp;D so I had to learn how THAC0 worked.

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:31.242
And I was like, "Okay, what kind of wizard can I
make? Oh, there are kits!" And your kits are ways

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:35.003
you customize your character, and so I was like,
"Oh, a militant wizard? I get to wield a sword and

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:38.961
"be a wizard like Gandalf? Cool!" Little did I know
it was the most useless kit ever because wizards

00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:45.454
back then were so dead if you didn't have magic
ready. So if you get up with a sword and go "Eh!"

00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:53.442
you're dead. So it wasn't the best idea, but it
was fine and we played for a bit, but my DM at the

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:58.349
time was not the best DM, and after we played for
a few months, I got really frustrated with the

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:04.416
style, and we had one crux moment during a game
that got me so frustrated I just left and decided,

00:06:04.416 --> 00:06:11.923
"I'm going to DM my own stuff now. I know there's
more to this. It can be better." And I really

00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:13.755
haven't played characters much since.

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:16.262
MARY: You've been DMing that long?

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:21.642
MATT: Yeah. I've played in games. I've played a
lot of other systems as well, but D&amp;D's kinda

00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:26.705
where my heart is because I'm a big RPG fantasy
nerd.

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:29.937
MARY: How are you liking Fifth Edition?

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:34.652
MATT: I love it! I love it. I think I've really
enjoyed Second Edition because it was all I knew,

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:39.824
although it had its quirks. Somehow everyone had
18-100 strength. Everyone was really lucky when

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:47.562
they rolled their character. But the math was
ridiculous. But it had such depth to it, and 3.0

00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:54.071
and 3.5 I felt were really, really good ways to allow
character customization. It did tend to complicate

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:58.854
aspects of combat, or at least cause a lot of
floating modifiers, and the math kind of--while

00:06:58.854 --> 00:07:08.368
less esoteric math-- based around the AC and THAC0
equation. It didn't lend to a lot of everyone

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:13.049
paying attention to, "Okay, you get the +1 from
here and this gives you +1 to hit and damage from

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:18.743
"the bard thing. Oh, but you have this Bless spell
on, so it's another +1 to hit from there, so +4...

00:07:18.743 --> 00:07:24.802
"but you're also turned away, so it's +3 and ugh!"
I just start bleeding from the nose.

00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:26.761
MARY: Head explodes.

00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:31.761
MATT: But you know, you made it work, and it was
better than previous editions, and Fourth Edition

00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:38.503
came out and that was a struggle to certain
points. I ran a long-term Fourth Edition game

00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:44.063
which my friend Shawn actually played in here.
Yeah, we actually had a great job. Actually, Shawn

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:49.982
here, if you guys are watching the game we did the
other night, we had the Q&amp;A? He was the rogue in

00:07:49.982 --> 00:08:00.130
my Ravenloft campaign for two years that ended up
taking over the castle after Strahd and cut out

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:07.162
the bard's tongue and turned him into his own
private Theon at end of the game. A real happy

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:10.515
ending there. Ravenloft.

00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:12.836
MARY: Sang with a lot of vowels after that.

00:08:12.836 --> 00:08:19.735
MATT: Fourth Edition, it had some cool ideas, I
love the skill challenge aspect of it. I felt the

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:26.345
idea of the at-will magics-- Magic practitioners
never actually ran out of spells, there was some

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:30.375
low-level stuff that they could just do forever.
It was really great and useful, because as a

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:36.029
wizard I never wanna have to go, "Well, I'm out of
spells." You shouldn't have that, you shouldn't

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:40.425
have to be able to only Mage Hand three times a
day. I'm like, "No, I don't want to pick up stuff.

00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:49.106
"I trained for years in this shit. Make my book
float to me!" So the Fourth Edition at-will magics

00:08:49.106 --> 00:08:53.243
carried over as the cantrips in Fifth, and so they
kept that over, which was really nice. The skill

00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:58.144
system was a little more refined and the Fifth
Edition combat and character development still

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:03.688
allows a breadth of customization with your
character, but not overcomplicated, and I really

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:07.863
felt like they streamlined it in the right ways,
so I'm really enjoying Fifth Edition. I think it's

00:09:07.863 --> 00:09:09.259
[audio skips].

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:13.231
MARY: Yeah, cantrips are awesome, because I
realized as a warlock, I get three spells and

00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.176
that's it. I mean like three? That's it.

00:09:16.176 --> 00:09:21.408
MATT: To be fair, those three spells--

00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:23.578
MARY: They're pretty good.

00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:26.089
MATT: They pack a punch there.

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:30.330
MARY: Come on, how many hit points did Rimefang
have left when I did the Hellish Rebuke? It was

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:36.709
like six, right? So Laura could have went (blows)
on him and he would have been dead. It was just I

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:48.198
got lucky with the timing of my turn, that's it.
Both times. Happy Birthday, Laura. (laughs)

00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:56.798
MATT: That's one of the things I love about this
game in general and any RPG system, is everybody

00:09:56.798 --> 00:10:02.051
who grew up as a kid playing in their front yard
kind of fighting windmills like Don Quixote, we

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:05.258
all had that period of time where we embraced our
imagination and made up stories and went with it.

00:10:05.258 --> 00:10:10.960
And as we grow up, society tends to have this
trend of pushing that thought away. "No, you must

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.737
"be a realist. You must not play. You must not be
able to get together with people and just be

00:10:15.737 --> 00:10:20.709
"creative for the hell of being creative." And RPGs
are one of the mediums that continues to allow

00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:26.321
that to flourish long into adulthood, and I think
it's such a wonderful therapeutic and positive way

00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:32.378
of reinforcing social connection with people. I've
built stronger bonds with the people I've gamed with

00:10:32.378 --> 00:10:36.488
than most anybody else in my life, and there's
something about that shared adventure experience

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:40.229
that's so wonderful and those memories are real.

00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:45.071
MARY: But you're world-building, too, in your
memory, building off of these characters. I look

00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:50.849
up-- I mean, these are some of my best friends in
the world are playing on Critical Role, and after

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:56.029
a while I forget that it's Laura and Travis and
Sam and Liam. I'm just worried about how the hell

00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:02.338
is Scanlan going get out of this stupid dragon?
And Grog is on the chain flying behind him and Vex

00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:07.588
can't fly fast enough on the broom and if he lets
go-- I mean, these are massive concerns about

00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:13.794
these characters that I've really come to love. I
let go of the fact that I'm stalking my friends

00:11:13.794 --> 00:11:21.150
online, because it was a real conflict for a
while. Is it weird that I'm watching my friends

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:28.438
every week play this game? And I realize it
wasn't. I know it's weird. Why be normal, right?

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:33.388
But it was amazing and I'm just so in love with
these characters. I'm so glad that Pike is back.

00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:34.890
It's just--

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.451
(cheers and applause)

00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:44.539
MATT: We've never been so torn about promoting a
friend's television series. "Go watch Blindspot,

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:49.198
"hopefully it'll get a second season."

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.070
ASHLEY: You're like some kind of wizard!

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.594
AUDREY: What do we do now, elf?

00:11:52.594 --> 00:11:56.011
ASHLEY: Actually, I am a gnome cleric. Now--

00:11:56.011 --> 00:12:00.998
MARY: So we keep praying to move Blindspot to LA
so she doesn't have to go back to New York.

00:12:00.998 --> 00:12:07.114
MATT: So if we can write a petition to Blindspot
to set the show in LA next season, that'd be

00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:18.499
great. We'd appreciate that. Part of this-- since
you know the gist of it so far, let's open the

00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:21.181
floor to questions. We'll turn this into a Q&amp;A. We
have a microphone--

00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:23.190
MARY: There's a mic there, so if you guys want to
ask anything--

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.749
MATT: Go ahead and line up behind that microphone
and we'll start taking your questions one at time.

00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:30.750
We'll get through as many of you guys as we
possibly can. As you can see, we have a looming

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.819
48, 47 minutes left.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.284
MARY: 47:47, make a wish!

00:12:34.284 --> 00:12:37.661
MATT: All right, sir, what's your name?

00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:44.448
CONNER: My name's Conner, hello hello? Screw it,
I'm loud!

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:47.162
MARY: Be loud, Conner! Be loud!

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:50.664
CONNER: My name's Conner, sometimes people call me
Tiffany, don't ask why.

00:12:50.664 --> 00:12:52.114
MATT: Hi, Conner-Tiffany!

00:12:52.114 --> 00:13:01.318
CONNER: So my question, a bit more of a serious
one: there's so much stigma around games like D&amp;D

00:13:01.318 --> 00:13:06.715
and roleplaying and stuff like that, that
society sometimes tends to exploit that nerd

00:13:06.715 --> 00:13:09.702
culture with shows like Big Bang Theory and
whatnot--

00:13:09.702 --> 00:13:11.349
MATT: (shudders)

00:13:11.349 --> 00:13:15.975
CONNER: I told you it was a serious question.

00:13:15.975 --> 00:13:21.908
MATT: No, it is, and you definitely tugged a cord
there. You invoked that which should not be

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:25.653
invoked. Continue, no, it's a necessary
conversation.

00:13:25.653 --> 00:13:32.498
CONNER: Now things like Critical Role, which
features, if I may say, a charismatic cast of

00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:42.383
people that are authentically playing the game.
How do you think this is going to trend in the

00:13:42.383 --> 00:13:48.678
next ten years where these types of things start
to become more popular culture? Where they start

00:13:48.678 --> 00:13:55.316
having followings, niche audiences, like with Twitch,
it's a great way to get out to 20 or 30

00:13:55.398 --> 00:14:00.057
thousand views per episode, livestreaming. Do you
think it's going to keep addressed in this area, do

00:14:00.057 --> 00:14:05.444
you think you it's going to become an actual
television series or something like that one day?

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:06.844
What are your thoughts on that?

00:14:06.844 --> 00:14:13.051
MATT: I don't know. We're still kind of holding
on as to what this show is. We had no idea this

00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:18.585
was going to become whatever it is. We had like a
six to eight week plan of, "Well, if it doesn't

00:14:18.585 --> 00:14:24.005
"work out, we'll just go home and keep playing on
our own." And people found us and resonated and

00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:29.382
started creating their own games and it just built
this community that I never expected. It's become

00:14:29.382 --> 00:14:33.415
so much more important to me than just a game we
play now. It's introducing other people to it and

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:37.274
watching them create their own stories with their
friends and send us pictures of their game nights

00:14:37.274 --> 00:14:43.932
and their families playing now. To me it's--
D&amp;D has an unfortunate stigma because of when the

00:14:43.932 --> 00:14:48.791
time it came out there was a very anti-D&amp;D
fundamentalist Christian movement that didn't

00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:53.954
understand the game, just saw surface elements and
decided that it was "evil demons being summoned!"

00:14:53.954 --> 00:14:55.689
CONNER: Those are my people, I apologize.

00:14:55.689 --> 00:15:00.224
MATT: Oh no, it's okay! It's my people too!
(Southern accent) My family's all from the South as

00:15:00.224 --> 00:15:11.291
well, I fully understand. Don't think y'all gotta
carry that burden just yourself. So that put a

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:16.559
stigma on it, and the media of course ran with it,
as it does. So yeah, it got off to a bad start.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:22.903
But I think now, through geek culture becoming pop
culture, for better or for worse, I think largely

00:15:22.903 --> 00:15:29.051
for the better, you're now seeing a trend of
people that grew up playing D&amp;D, who grew up

00:15:29.051 --> 00:15:32.016
writing stories and making up stories with their
friends, are inheriting the entertainment

00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:36.830
industry. They're becoming the producers and the
writers and the directors of films, television. So

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.483
that's part of the reason we've had this big
surgence in geek culture is because now the people

00:15:40.483 --> 00:15:44.072
that are creating the media are the geeks. We took
over.

00:15:44.072 --> 00:15:48.332
MARY: Yeah. Yeah, we did. It wasn't "the meek
shall inherit the earth," it was "the geeks shall

00:15:48.332 --> 00:15:50.205
"inherit the earth." I mean, it really is.

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:57.051
MATT: And so, to your question there, I'm not sure
where it's going to go. I think it's cool that

00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:00.892
it's bringing it to an audience that didn't have
the opportunity to really understand at first.

00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:04.936
There are a lot of people out there that would
love to play RPGs, but like Mary said, you just

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:09.427
didn't really know what it was, and there was a
weird-- between the stigma, or just intimidation,

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:13.846
you didn't think it was something you could or
would want to do. And so, through these shows, a

00:16:13.846 --> 00:16:18.197
lot of people message us almost daily saying,
since I watched your show I went out and bought

00:16:18.197 --> 00:16:21.323
the books and started a game with my family, or
with my father, and we reconnected through it.

00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:27.156
It's become this really cool re-emergence of
tabletop gaming. And thanks to other shows, like

00:16:27.156 --> 00:16:31.537
High Rollers and the Real Role Play Guys, and now
the Dice, Camera, Action that Wizards does,

00:16:31.537 --> 00:16:37.013
there's this trend now of people showing other
people what D&amp;D can be. And other RPGs as well.

00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:41.128
Like Zac, who used to run our stream, is now doing
his Hyper RPG Go up in Seattle, and they're doing

00:16:41.128 --> 00:16:47.984
a bunch of awesome Shadowrun games and all these
different other types of RPGs as well. So will it

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:52.288
end up mainstream media? I don't know. I know
there's people trying it, because whenever

00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:55.764
anything seems to be doing well on the internet,
that means all the executives in a room somewhere

00:16:55.764 --> 00:17:00.786
with a bunch of suits have to be like, "How can we
capture this and make money?" So I'm sure we'll

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:05.799
see some attempts at that. Some may be genuine,
some may not be. I think the charm of our show is

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:09.678
the fact that we're just a bunch of doofuses that
like each other a lot, and play for our own

00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:16.351
amusement, not necessarily to make maximum dollar
for our company. As soon as that gets introduced,

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:20.557
it kind of gets a little weird and, I don't know,
the flavor gets a little tainted for me. So I

00:17:20.557 --> 00:17:24.763
think as long as people are genuine in producing
this content, it will still resonate with people.

00:17:24.763 --> 00:17:29.619
So we'll see how the entertainment industry treats
it. I know we're putting our feet on the ground

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:34.095
making sure that it doesn't fall in that category,
because I would rather jump in front of traffic. (laughs)

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:39.067
MARY: Yeah. I also feel like it's sort of starting
to change the whole idea of "adulting." You know,

00:17:39.067 --> 00:17:43.367
of what it is to be an adult, and you have to be
straight and serious and everything else. And it's

00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:48.194
just like that combined with the internet, and
everything in this sort of isolationism that that

00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:53.909
causes, that this is now bringing people together
again in a social environment, to be creative. And

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:57.801
with the cutting of funding in schools and
everything else, I feel like we're sort of losing

00:17:57.801 --> 00:18:04.686
that creativity, and that idea that we are here
to-- That's one of our main things as human

00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:12.324
beings, is the power to create, you know? I just
think it's an amazing thing, and I think it's

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:17.835
bringing people together. And bringing this out of
the basement and into the light, and making it

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:23.376
cool. And that it's all right to now talk to
people again and not just sit on your phone and

00:18:23.376 --> 00:18:25.186
tweet anonymously to people, you know?

00:18:25.186 --> 00:18:28.825
MATT: To be fair, it's okay to go back in the
basement, for those of us who don't like light.

00:18:28.825 --> 00:18:30.243
MARY: Yeah, that's fine.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:32.566
MATT: Not a fan of sunlight myself. Basement's
cool.

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:37.457
MARY: Yeah. Nothing wrong with that. But still. Go
out and see the stars. There's no light. Go look

00:18:37.457 --> 00:18:38.716
at the stars.

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.005
CONNER: That's it. Well, thanks for coming to
MomoCon.

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.133
MATT and MARY: Thanks for having us.

00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:44.185
MARY: Thanks, Tiffany. We love you.

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:52.006
STEPHANIE: I think it's working. Do I need to
be--? Hi!

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:53.347
MATT: Hi! What's your name?

00:18:53.347 --> 00:18:54.247
STEPHANIE: Stephanie.

00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:55.339
MATT: Hi, Stephanie.

00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:59.786
STEPHANIE: I just wanted to say thank you for
bringing Critical Role into my life, because it's

00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:04.367
amazing. And, I'm pretty sure, into everybody
else's life that's here. So I just wanted to thank

00:19:04.367 --> 00:19:11.596
you personally, and also congratulate you guys
personally for 50 plus episodes of Critical Role.

00:19:11.596 --> 00:19:15.575
(cheering)

00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:18.537
STEPHANIE: And so my question is-- I'm sorry; I'm
shaking.

00:19:18.537 --> 00:19:19.997
MATT: It's okay.

00:19:19.997 --> 00:19:29.107
STEPHANIE: My question to you guys: Which is your
favorite character in the Critical Role world?

00:19:29.107 --> 00:19:32.936
MATT: Okay. Favorite character in the Critical
Role world.

00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:36.716
MARY: What's his name, who Percy goes to to get
ammunition?

00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:37.596
MATT: Victor.

00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:44.926
MARY: Victor! Victor. The fact that-- Who watched
the birth of Victor? The first time-- I mean, come

00:19:44.926 --> 00:19:49.065
on! How, where? It just came out.

00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:55.894
MATT: That's what scares me. I don't know where it
came from. That was a purely improvised character.

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.515
That has become like a staple now.

00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:02.235
MARY: I know, and I'm so afraid every time you go
back to him there's going to be less and less of him.

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:03.494
(laughter)

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:09.156
MATT: There's a good chance. When you're the only
individual that has discovered black powder in the

00:20:09.156 --> 00:20:16.699
universe, and that's kind of your personality,
you're not going to be very careful with it. We've

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:24.096
already seen him blow up once, though it was not
in canon. Victor's an interesting one. I'm sure

00:20:24.096 --> 00:20:25.614
he'll show up again.

00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:30.876
MARY: They're all so unique though, everybody's
got such wonderful personalities. I love the way

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:35.257
that Vax and Vex play off of-- I'm a twin, so to
see them play off each other. Yeah, they're

00:20:35.257 --> 00:20:39.783
totally twins. It's kind of amazing, and Sam
Riegel is just a bloody genius.

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:42.408
(laughter)

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.909
MARY: I don't know where that stuff comes from.

00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:46.657
MATT: Same place Victor came from, I think.

00:20:46.657 --> 00:20:52.430
MARY: Yeah, I think so. And Travis. Who doesn't
love Grog? I was sort of scared with Craven Edge,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.935
I thought for a while Bacon might take our Grog,
and I don't want that to happen.

00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:59.296
MATT: Yeah. (chuckles)

00:20:59.296 --> 00:21:01.178
(laughter)

00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:03.618
MARY: And there's still the skull. Still that
skull though, isn't that skull still there?

00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:04.709
MATT: Yeah, what happened to that skull?

00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:06.271
MARY: I don't know. Where did that skull go?

00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:07.338
MATT: I know where it went.

00:21:07.338 --> 00:21:09.718
(laughter)

00:21:09.718 --> 00:21:13.948
MARY: How far in advance do you plan where they're
going to go? In this world, I mean.

00:21:13.948 --> 00:21:17.988
MATT: I don't plan where they're going to go,
because I don't know where they're going to go. I

00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:24.878
plan possible places they can go. I try and
prepare enough to the point where I'm not

00:21:24.878 --> 00:21:30.276
completely lost if they make random choices, but
it still happens occasionally. For me it's about

00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:33.868
considering what their discussions have been in
the game, listening to what their characters have

00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:39.180
insinuated they might want to do next, and then
I'll flesh out those avenues they might possibly

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.549
go, so that when they choose that path or this path, I
have some things prepared for it.

00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:50.250
MARY: Did you have the acid river prepared when
you knew at some point they were going to get on

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.519
that rug?

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.848
(laughter)

00:21:52.848 --> 00:21:54.758
MARY: I'm sorry, I know it's a very painful
wound.

00:21:54.758 --> 00:21:57.718
MATT: No, the acid river had nothing to do with
the rug. The acid river had everything to do with Wil

00:21:57.718 --> 00:21:59.471
Wheaton being a guest in that episode.

00:21:59.552 --> 00:22:01.036
(laughter)

00:22:01.036 --> 00:22:02.348
MARY: Okay, why?

00:22:02.348 --> 00:22:06.208
MATT: Okay, so you aren't aware of this: Wil
Wheaton used to play on Acquisitions Inc., which is

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:11.009
the PAX prime live game they did with the official
D&amp;D folks, and he had a character named Aeofel who

00:22:11.009 --> 00:22:14.408
died horribly in a pit of acid.

00:22:14.408 --> 00:22:16.471
MARY: Oh. Did he always roll ones?

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:17.891
MATT: Of course. It's Wil Wheaton!

00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:19.646
(laughter)

00:22:19.646 --> 00:22:26.605
MATT: And it became a thing. He was really
distraught that his character died straight-up and

00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:30.198
was gone for good in this acid pit, and the
internet of course let him know: "Hey man, your

00:22:30.198 --> 00:22:35.874
"guy died in acid." He's like: "I know." You get
this whole long post about the eulogy of Aeofel

00:22:35.874 --> 00:22:39.777
and it became a thing. And so acid pits and him is
a very sore spot. So of course when I had the

00:22:39.777 --> 00:22:44.532
opportunity to have Wil Wheaton play in my D&amp;D
game, I couldn't not do that.

00:22:44.532 --> 00:22:46.411
(laughter)

00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:53.748
MATT: It also just unfortunately happened that the rug
got in. I was like: "Oh!" Magical enchantments can

00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:57.618
resist certain things, but that's not one of them
for a tapestry.

00:22:57.618 --> 00:22:59.683
(laughter)

00:22:59.683 --> 00:23:06.588
MATT: Yeah. It's hard for me to pick a favorite
character. I really enjoy playing, as an NPC,

00:23:06.588 --> 00:23:11.747
Gilmore is a lot of fun.

00:23:11.747 --> 00:23:13.599
MARY: Gilmore. I was just going to say.

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:14.604
(cheering)

00:23:14.604 --> 00:23:17.688
MATT: The NPCs I have that are the most layered
are Gilmore and Allura, and I enjoy playing them

00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:21.929
both for different reasons, because they're both
very, very layered characters. You guys have

00:23:21.929 --> 00:23:26.702
probably only seen elements of those two, and I
hope more of that plays out in the future, but

00:23:26.702 --> 00:23:30.979
both those characters are two that I really enjoy
jumping into their shoes for a bit. They're both

00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:32.823
very close and personal to me.

00:23:32.823 --> 00:23:34.028
STEPHANIE: Thank you guys!

00:23:34.028 --> 00:23:35.425
MATT: Thank you! Good question.

00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:37.591
ERIN: Hello.

00:23:37.591 --> 00:23:38.625
MATT: Hello, what's your name?

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:45.888
ERIN: My name is Erin, I'm songtree on Twitch and
also Twitter. My question is: Do you guys ever

00:23:45.888 --> 00:23:51.251
watch past episodes, and if so, which one have
you watched the most, or have you most enjoyed?

00:23:51.251 --> 00:23:59.960
MARY: I have watched them all. I watch it every
week with you guys. We flew in on Thursday night,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.688
landed about 10:30 or 11:00, and I'm in the car
going: "I can find it, I can find it on Twitch,

00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:12.479
"it's-- There it is!" And the Q&amp;A was going on and
stayed up until two and watched Percy, and then I

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:16.860
was like, "I can't watch, I have to go to bed." So
I'm live-tweeting with you guys pretty much every

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:27.219
week if I'm available. I loved the Wil and Kash
episodes, I thought those were really fun.

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:28.439
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:28.439 --> 00:24:33.467
MARY: I wish we had been there to see Pike die and
be brought back.

00:24:33.467 --> 00:24:35.620
MATT: Yeah, that was intense.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.268
(silence)

00:24:37.268 --> 00:24:39.857
(laughter)

00:24:39.857 --> 00:24:43.619
MARY: I remember hearing about it, Laura was like:
"Aww." That's the week I was like, "What's wrong?"

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:48.461
She's like, "Intense D&amp;D..." Because you guys used
to play how many hours a day? You would do these

00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:50.037
marathon sessions.

00:24:50.037 --> 00:24:53.438
MATT: Yeah, because we could only play once every
four to six weeks, and so we'd play for a standard

00:24:53.438 --> 00:24:57.071
eight hours, or more sometimes, depending.

00:24:57.071 --> 00:24:58.314
ERIN: Yeah, full Saturday.

00:24:58.314 --> 00:25:02.056
MATT: We wanted to get as much time as we could
when we got the dads away from their kids, we had

00:25:02.056 --> 00:25:09.518
a very short window where we're like: "All right,
maximize time!" Then we all go home drained. Worth

00:25:09.518 --> 00:25:17.248
it. So as far as your question is concerned, I've
rewatched a lot of them, partially because I have

00:25:17.248 --> 00:25:21.984
to go back and-- It works as a good note-taker as
a DM to have the actual episode online. I'd be

00:25:21.984 --> 00:25:27.717
like: "What-- Who did they meet again? What NPC
did they talk to, oh crap, I'll look it up. Okay,

00:25:27.717 --> 00:25:31.122
"there we go, what did that character sound like?"
It's been a helpful tool for me to have that

00:25:31.122 --> 00:25:35.443
video. There have been times where we'd put
episodes on in the background when we had to leave

00:25:35.443 --> 00:25:38.544
our bird alone for a while, just so she'd hear our
voices.

00:25:38.544 --> 00:25:39.987
(awwing)

00:25:39.987 --> 00:25:41.848
MARY: Which is your bird's favorite episode?

00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:53.955
MATT: I don't know. She's a bird? We found
ourselves putting this couple of episodes on and

00:25:53.955 --> 00:25:56.648
then sitting down and ended up watching a full
episode, and me and Marisha would be like: "Oh,

00:25:56.648 --> 00:25:57.988
"we're those people."

00:25:57.988 --> 00:25:59.119
(laughter)

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:04.211
MATT: We're like: "We watched a full episode of
our own show that we already did. Ugh." It was a

00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:05.447
good episode, though.

00:26:05.447 --> 00:26:06.998
(laughter)

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:10.897
MATT: The one I probably watched the most, just
because I love the reactions to it, would have

00:26:10.897 --> 00:26:12.808
been the Conclave attack.

00:26:12.808 --> 00:26:16.009
MARY: That was so good.

00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:17.847
MATT: Yeah it was.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:19.158
MARY: Man.

00:26:19.158 --> 00:26:20.728
MATT: Holding on to that for two years.

00:26:20.728 --> 00:26:28.290
MARY: Wow. And stuff is going to go down. I can't
wait to see it.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.928
ERIN: For me it's probably cows.

00:26:30.928 --> 00:26:33.439
MARY: Cows. That was amazing.

00:26:33.439 --> 00:26:42.659
MATT: Let me tell you. Seeming messes up
everything in the best way. Thank you so much.

00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:47.467
All right, we have a few people back there, we'll
try and make these answers more concise, my fault,

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.195
sorry. Hello.

00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:51.409
ANDREW: Hi. My name is Andrew.

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:55.310
MARY: You can tilt that up if you want. No, just
the mic itself. There you go.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.238
ANDREW: Appreciate it. I'm tall.

00:26:58.238 --> 00:26:59.307
MATT and MARY: Hi Paul!

00:26:59.307 --> 00:27:01.118
ANDREW: No, I'm Andrew.

00:27:01.118 --> 00:27:03.007
(laughter)

00:27:03.007 --> 00:27:04.647
ANDREW: No, I had to adjust the mic.

00:27:04.647 --> 00:27:05.988
MARY: Oh, you're tall? Hi Tall!

00:27:05.988 --> 00:27:06.954
MATT: I see.

00:27:06.954 --> 00:27:07.979
(laughter)

00:27:07.979 --> 00:27:09.028
MARY: Sorry.

00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:13.410
ANDREW: My question is mostly directed at Matt.
Because I'm kind of an aspiring voice actor, but

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:19.370
I'm kind of coming up here asking as a
going-to-be-a-DM and game designer.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.689
MATT: Oh, very cool.

00:27:20.689 --> 00:27:26.367
ANDREW: And so I was hoping-- One thing I'm trying
to figure out is, I've got a game in the works

00:27:26.367 --> 00:27:32.418
here, but the thing I'm trying to figure out is,
how do I help it to where I can help players

00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:38.228
begin, to where they can just set up a character
in maybe ten, 15 minutes and go. Have there been

00:27:38.228 --> 00:27:40.898
systems that have been fairly welcoming?

00:27:40.898 --> 00:27:44.598
MATT: There are many systems that are a lot faster
at character building than D&amp;D. D&amp;D is a fairly

00:27:44.598 --> 00:27:56.127
deep system. It's not super deep, it's not Rifts
deep. There are other systems that are a lot

00:27:56.127 --> 00:28:04.680
faster, some Savage World stuff can be pretty fast
to put together. If you look online for fast

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.627
character generation RPGs, especially on RPGnet,
they'll have a lot of examples that I can't think

00:28:10.627 --> 00:28:12.459
of any off of the top of my head right now.

00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:13.718
AUDIENCE: Dungeon World.

00:28:13.718 --> 00:28:20.731
MATT: Dungeon World! There you go, that's one.
Those are all great systems. If it's D&amp;D in

00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:27.057
particular, you can also pre-create characters,
like generate a character per class if it's their

00:28:27.057 --> 00:28:31.427
first game and they don't know what to do. Then
instead of having them build it, you can have them

00:28:31.427 --> 00:28:36.877
pick from the list and tweak and customize a few
things if they want to, and then introduce them to

00:28:36.877 --> 00:28:40.657
the game. That way you have taken the weight off
their shoulders. I've done that for a few people,

00:28:40.657 --> 00:28:44.458
where I'll create their character for them in
advance and they'll show up and be like: "Okay,

00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:49.605
"I'll pick this guy." And I'm like: "Cool, go!" And
the other characters just go away. Or I make them

00:28:49.605 --> 00:28:52.839
NPCs. Why not? That's my recommendation.

00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:54.929
ANDREW: Cool. Appreciate it.

00:28:54.929 --> 00:28:56.358
MATT: No worries. Good question.

00:28:56.358 --> 00:28:57.560
ANDREW: Thank you.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.688
MARY: Good luck with the voice acting.

00:28:58.688 --> 00:29:00.385
MATT: And good luck with he DMing, dude!

00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:02.268
HARLEY: Okay, I'm much shorter. Hi!

00:29:02.268 --> 00:29:03.109
MATT and MARY: Hi!

00:29:03.109 --> 00:29:06.639
HARLEY: My name is Harley, like the motorcycle,
because people end up calling me Hayleigh.

00:29:06.639 --> 00:29:09.357
MATT: Hey Harley. Harley Quinn is more what I
would think.

00:29:09.357 --> 00:29:10.593
MARY: Yeah, it's what I would go to.

00:29:10.593 --> 00:29:15.906
HARLEY: More people that I know apparently know
the motorcycle than that Quinn. So my question is:

00:29:15.906 --> 00:29:20.031
How do y'all come up with the voices for y'all's
characters? Because that's always interesting,

00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:23.458
because each of them have different accents, and
ways of speaking.

00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:29.676
MARY: Zahra was easy for me, the minute I said
"Zahra" I was like, well, that's her voice right

00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:36.507
there. Anybody who's got a name called Zahra, and
she was very sort of in there. I had been doing a

00:29:36.507 --> 00:29:45.854
female crusader for Diablo 3 and for Heroes of the
Storm, and I loved Johanna, and she was a bit more

00:29:45.854 --> 00:29:51.949
street, but I loved that vocal placement. I didn't
even know what Zahra was going to be until we

00:29:51.949 --> 00:29:58.318
started the show, and then that's what the voice
was. It just came out of that and my obsession of

00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:03.478
the moon and the stars and everything else, so I
thought I'd start with myself. Because I didn't

00:30:03.478 --> 00:30:08.817
know anything else, especially about this world,
so when I was building her I just said, well, I'll

00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:13.097
have her be obsessed with the moon and everything
else, because that's an obsession I'm very

00:30:13.097 --> 00:30:21.388
familiar with, so I started with me and my own
likes and I think I'm trying to figure out what I want

00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:27.618
to roll next. I would love to hear you talk about
the bard, the conductor--

00:30:27.618 --> 00:30:28.685
MATT: The Maestro?

00:30:28.685 --> 00:30:35.202
MARY: The Maestro, yeah, sounds really cool. So,
short answer is Zahra, and thus came her voice.

00:30:35.272 --> 00:30:51.150
MATT: I spent a lot of time alone as a kid. I
don't know? For me, especially from a DM

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:59.820
standpoint, it's considering sometimes character
regionality or some races might have kitschy

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.421
themes through them. Like the dwarves, I tend to
go Scottish. Not all of them, but just because

00:31:03.421 --> 00:31:07.301
it's classic, and I will always make any excuse for
myself to do a Scottish brogue because it's my

00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:15.061
favorite dialect ever. I love it so much. It's
like music. Horrible, discordant music.

00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:20.021
MARY: What was the game that you were talking
about yesterday with Taliesin? Taliesin directed

00:31:20.021 --> 00:31:21.041
you in a game.

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:21.991
MATT: Akiba's Trip?

00:31:21.991 --> 00:31:22.771
MARY: Yeah.

00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:27.833
MATT: Yeah, they had me do the "foreigner voice,"
which is a voice setting you can set for NPCs in

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:31.192
the game, and in the Japanese version the
foreigner voice is American and they couldn't do

00:31:31.192 --> 00:31:35.341
that. Taliesin was like, "Whatever accent you want
to do that's not American," so I'm like (Scottish

00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:41.250
voice) "All right. This is your foreigner." Which
is great, because you could set the voices to

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:47.251
little moe café maids. Little cute anime girl, and
you enter and it's like (Scottish voice) "Hello!

00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:48.741
"Would you like a tea?"

00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:51.803
(laughter)

00:31:51.803 --> 00:31:53.671
MARY: I love that story so much.

00:31:53.671 --> 00:32:01.623
MATT: As such, I think everyone should play that
game. For that reason alone. For me, it's just

00:32:01.623 --> 00:32:05.272
what works for the character, what sounds
different and unique so they stand out against

00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:09.969
each other. I've made a lot of characters in this
world and I don't have that many voices, so it's

00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:14.318
hard to differentiate a lot of the time, so I try
and find ways, whether it be through texture,

00:32:14.318 --> 00:32:16.701
timbre, vocal patterns--

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.557
MARY: Attitude is huge.

00:32:18.557 --> 00:32:20.516
MATT: Accents-- attitude, physicality.

00:32:20.516 --> 00:32:26.683
MARY: I mean, Gilmore, the minute you do that--
that's Gilmore, right? He doesn't need to say a

00:32:26.683 --> 00:32:32.291
word. It's just... all of a sudden he's there.
It's amazing. It's physicality as well. I think

00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:36.870
that also-- for me, as a watcher, it really
enhances the characters.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.072
MATT: Being a dragon can be a dragon.

00:32:39.072 --> 00:32:40.833
(cheering)

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:45.205
MATT: But being a dragon can be a dragon.

00:32:45.205 --> 00:32:47.758
MARY: Not anymore, Rimefang.

00:32:47.758 --> 00:32:48.915
MATT: Aww...

00:32:48.915 --> 00:32:51.116
(laughter)

00:32:51.116 --> 00:32:52.578
HARLEY: Thank you.

00:32:52.578 --> 00:32:58.027
MATT: Good question! Thank you. Hello! There we
go.

00:32:58.027 --> 00:32:59.141
NICK: Hi.

00:32:59.141 --> 00:33:00.165
MATT: Hi, what's your name?

00:33:00.165 --> 00:33:01.050
NICK: I'm Nick.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.020
MATT and MARY: Hi, Nick!

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:08.914
NICK: Quick question. You guys go to a ton of
different places in-- Westruun was the main

00:33:08.914 --> 00:33:10.462
continent, right?

00:33:10.462 --> 00:33:12.931
MATT: Tal'Dorei's the main continent that they're
in right now, yeah.

00:33:12.931 --> 00:33:14.535
NICK: Tal'Dorei, got it. Where's Westruun? Sorry.

00:33:14.535 --> 00:33:16.752
MATT: Westruun is a town in central Tal'Dorei.

00:33:16.752 --> 00:33:22.020
NICK: Got it. So in Tal'Dorei, you guys go to tons
of different places. My question is: do you have

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:28.105
any deserts in there? Everywhere gets colder and
colder. It's cold one way, and then you go north

00:33:28.105 --> 00:33:32.055
and it's colder now. Are there any deserts or hot
places?

00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:37.842
MATT: On Tal'Dorei-- Tal'Dorei is a northern
continent. It starts to crest... Othanzia is much

00:33:37.842 --> 00:33:42.381
colder, which is the other continent that has
Vasselheim. That's where the Slayer's Take is,

00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:48.325
that's where the Fire Ashari exist. That one's
even further north and that one's most of the time

00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:53.648
covered in snow or at least some level of cold,
cloudy weather. The northern parts of Tal'Dorei

00:33:53.648 --> 00:34:00.091
like Whitestone and where Kraghammer is-- those
are a little more snow-covered. But yeah, it's a

00:34:00.091 --> 00:34:07.532
colder continent by nature. It's more of the
European-type climate. Marquet is a southern

00:34:07.532 --> 00:34:14.611
continent. That's where Ank'Harel is, and that is
a mostly desert continent. It is probably 70%

00:34:14.611 --> 00:34:24.165
desert-covered. If ever they go there, that will
be a very different scenic and cultural experience

00:34:24.165 --> 00:34:27.950
than what they've encountered at all in the
campaign thus far. Should be interesting.

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.020
NICK: Thank you.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.922
MATT: No worries.

00:34:29.922 --> 00:34:34.401
NICK: Could we hear McCree or the black powder
merchant? (laughter) Either one!

00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:38.019
MATT: I'll do you one better. (McCree voice) "It's
high noon."

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:39.971
(cheering)

00:34:39.971 --> 00:34:44.735
MATT: (Victor voice) "What time? What time is it?
I don't know-- noon? No! It's three o'clock!"

00:34:44.735 --> 00:34:46.302
There you go.

00:34:46.302 --> 00:34:47.560
NICK: Thank you.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.020
(cheering)

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.622
MARY: So good. So good!

00:34:52.622 --> 00:34:55.594
RYAN: Hello. My name is Rock McKickass.

00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.163
MARY: Hey, Kick Ass!

00:34:57.163 --> 00:35:02.044
RYAN: My friends call me Ryan. First thing I
wanted to do was thank you on behalf of a friend

00:35:02.044 --> 00:35:07.048
of mine. He's running a Pathfinder campaign, and
when you did those Tips and Tricks videos on Geek

00:35:07.048 --> 00:35:10.612
and Sundry, I showed them to him and they helped
him immensely at running the campaign a lot

00:35:10.612 --> 00:35:11.828
smoother.

00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:16.672
MATT: Awesome! That's great. Also, a plug for a
friend, finding time to do more Tips and Tricks has

00:35:16.672 --> 00:35:21.877
been difficult. I am trying to get into a new
batch soon. But at the same time a good friend of

00:35:21.877 --> 00:35:27.461
mine, Matt Colville, who is the writer of Turtle
Rock, has gone further than I ever could as far as

00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:34.413
outlining really detailed videos on worldbuilding
and running a game, and running encounters. So if

00:35:34.413 --> 00:35:38.910
you're like, "Oh, I'm mad there's not more GM Tips."
There's a guy who is doing a much better job than

00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:46.343
me, who is doing a lot more than me, go watch his
shit. His stuff. Sorry. Family panel. But, yeah,

00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:48.861
Matt Colville, go check out his videos. They are
really good. Anyway, back to your question?

00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:53.772
RYAN: My question is: What was the most difficult
thing you have had to do as a DM and how did you

00:35:53.772 --> 00:35:55.781
end up dealing with it if you did?

00:35:55.781 --> 00:36:01.600
MATT: Killing a player is always a difficult
thing. I have done it in a few games and it's not

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:08.187
a fun experience, but it is an interesting
experience from a narrative standpoint. D&amp;D is a

00:36:08.187 --> 00:36:15.441
fantasy world and there are things that can
reverse death. In D&amp;D, sometimes it can be, later

00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:19.569
in the game, a little too easy to reverse death in
my opinion. That's why I introduced the skill

00:36:19.569 --> 00:36:24.031
challenge ritual for resurrection in my game. Take
an element of the skill challenge from Fourth

00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:29.823
Edition that I liked, and convert that to the idea
that not every soul can be recovered. Whether they

00:36:29.823 --> 00:36:34.641
themselves accept their own death, or whatever
entity holds sway over their immortal soul

00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:41.653
takes them before the ritual can... That's kind of
the challenge in that ritual. The players, their

00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:49.130
actions in that ritual essentially represent them
trying to facilitate or reach out to their soul to

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:56.703
stay and to come back to the body. But every
single time I've had to kill a player, it's hard.

00:36:56.703 --> 00:37:01.226
Because this person has put so much energy and
time into this. And you are essentially, not

00:37:01.226 --> 00:37:05.193
robbing them of it, but circumstantially, they're
losing it and you have to be the person to agree

00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:09.931
to it and tell them, "They're gone." And it sucks.
And it's hard. And people go home sometimes

00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:12.742
crying. And you're like, "What have I done?!"

00:37:12.742 --> 00:37:14.319
(laughter)

00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:20.482
MATT: But, conversely, that mourning process and
that acceptance, one, it's a fresh start for them

00:37:20.482 --> 00:37:25.588
to create something that they have always wanted
to play before. And the story implications of

00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:34.752
losing a hero really, really continues to guide
how tight the rest of the survivors are. I had a

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:42.338
game, once again Shawn was in, where we had most
of the party killed in a battle with a bunch of

00:37:42.338 --> 00:37:48.179
ghouls. In this one campaign, necromancy had been
abolished for so long that it was just a myth. No

00:37:48.179 --> 00:37:52.954
one believed that undead really existed or if they
did, it's more of a wives' tale and it's grossly

00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:57.851
exaggerated. Their first time into the Shadowfell
they go into this tomb and they walk into a room

00:37:57.851 --> 00:38:04.522
with a bunch of ghouls. And I think it was some
sort of an undead knight. And they're like, "Oh,

00:38:04.522 --> 00:38:08.118
"what the hell are these things? They're just
nasty-looking people? All right. We'll go and each

00:38:08.118 --> 00:38:18.422
"take one." Well, three people paralyzed later.
They just converged, and Shawn, being the smart

00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:22.556
person, his ranger grabbed Chloe, the rogue, who
was screaming out trying to help them and

00:38:22.556 --> 00:38:27.568
says, "No, we have to go. There's no way we can
win this," and dragged her out of the tomb as they

00:38:27.568 --> 00:38:30.584
watched their three other party members be eaten
alive by the ghouls.

00:38:30.584 --> 00:38:32.903
(groaning)

00:38:32.903 --> 00:38:37.602
MATT: And it was like, "What are you gonna do?
Welcome to the Shadowfell."

00:38:37.602 --> 00:38:40.323
(laughter)

00:38:40.323 --> 00:38:44.607
MATT: That's definitely the hardest thing for me
to do is to notify a player that their character

00:38:44.607 --> 00:38:48.124
is dead. Good question.

00:38:48.124 --> 00:38:56.364
JEREMY: Afternoon. My name is Jeremy.

00:38:56.364 --> 00:38:57.773
MATT: Hi, Jeremy.

00:38:57.773 --> 00:39:01.202
JEREMY: I guess this is a question for both of
you. One as a fan and one as a person running the

00:39:01.202 --> 00:39:07.446
game. Where do you hope the current Critical Role
campaign ends, and based on the suicidal

00:39:07.446 --> 00:39:13.401
tendencies of your players and friends, where do
you think it's actually going to end?

00:39:13.413 --> 00:39:17.080
MARY: There's a fine between suicidal and brave.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.323
JEREMY: True.

00:39:18.323 --> 00:39:21.038
MARY: I like to lean towards that they're brave.

00:39:21.038 --> 00:39:34.007
MATT: With a toe in suicidal. I-- Unless they
make real some serious mistakes. Here's the thing.

00:39:34.007 --> 00:39:41.021
For a TPK to happen they have to not be able to
acknowledge their mortality. Most TPKs happen in

00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:47.122
games because the players are assuming they're
going to win. Or they're just not being careful.

00:39:47.122 --> 00:39:53.305
"If we keep fighting and keep fighting-- Oh god
he's down too. I know if I keep fighting-- I'm the

00:39:53.305 --> 00:39:59.442
"only left. If I keep fighting-- We're dead?!" You
know? Then yeah, it's going to happen.

00:39:59.442 --> 00:40:02.660
Like Shawn-- that could have been a total TPK if
his character wasn't like, "Okay, we're not going

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.069
"to win this. Any chance we have of recovering this
party, some of us have to get out of here alive.

00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:11.883
"Run." As long as somebody does that, there are
opportunities to try and retrieve a few of those

00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:16.229
people, you know, because of resurrection magic,
and such. And there's always the Wish spell, you

00:40:16.229 --> 00:40:20.553
can always quest down the road, part of an
adventure for a while could be to find a way to

00:40:20.553 --> 00:40:25.468
find a being of enough power to be able to Wish a
friend back to life. That's a classic fantasy

00:40:25.468 --> 00:40:30.837
trope, and that's a really worthwhile journey.
That's-- go to the underworld to seek a friend and

00:40:30.837 --> 00:40:33.338
bring them back. That's as old as there's been
written word.

00:40:33.338 --> 00:40:35.579
MARY: Yeah, that's Greek mythology--

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:41.771
MATT: That's old Gilgamesh days in Greek
mythology, yeah. So (pause) I forgot the

00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:42.755
question.

00:40:42.755 --> 00:40:44.060
(laughter)

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.048
MARY: Where do you want--

00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:53.363
MATT: I think they have about a year of story left
before they finish the biggest arc of the story.

00:40:53.363 --> 00:41:03.055
The next step, beyond the Chroma Conclave, because
that's-- Thordak the Cinder King, I expect him to

00:41:03.055 --> 00:41:09.215
be probably around level 17 or 18 when they get to
that. Maybe earlier, depending on how brash they

00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:13.172
are, how careful they are. But there's other
things brewing in the world of Exandria.

00:41:13.172 --> 00:41:16.213
MARY: There's that spinning marble of death.

00:41:16.213 --> 00:41:18.415
MATT: I don't know what that's about.

00:41:18.415 --> 00:41:21.003
MARY: I don't know what that's about. What is that
about?

00:41:21.003 --> 00:41:24.574
MATT: Put all the survivors on top of it, what
could possibly go wrong?

00:41:24.574 --> 00:41:29.051
MARY: What could possibly go wrong? Just touch it,
get Grog, go on, grab it.

00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.804
MATT: Don't tell them about the marble.

00:41:30.804 --> 00:41:33.163
MARY: It's a good marble, it's good, you want it.

00:41:33.163 --> 00:41:34.305
AMANDA: Hi--

00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:35.391
MATT: Just a failed ritual.

00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:42.932
AMANDA: Hi, I'm Amanda. I was wondering-- First of
all, thank you for the hours and hours that you

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:48.823
spend doing Critical Role and preparing episodes
for us to watch every Thursday. Thank you so much.

00:41:48.823 --> 00:41:53.634
(cheering)

00:41:53.634 --> 00:42:00.553
AMANDA: My question is: I'm trying to start my own
campaign at my school, but-- And it's really funny

00:42:00.603 --> 00:42:04.435
because it's a liberal arts college so you'd think
that there would be a lot of people into it, but

00:42:04.435 --> 00:42:09.775
they keep turning away, like, "Oh, that's not
cool." I was wondering you would have any tips as

00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:15.336
to how to get people into D&amp;D, because I'm trying
to-- I really want to do a game.

00:42:15.336 --> 00:42:19.814
MATT: Have you ever seen that scene in A Clockwork
Orange with the--

00:42:19.814 --> 00:42:22.233
(laughter)

00:42:22.233 --> 00:42:31.394
MATT: That's the hard thing. You can't force
someone to want to play an RPG. You can always

00:42:31.457 --> 00:42:37.243
find ways to show them that it's not what you
think it is. And if not Critical Role, there are

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:40.853
other shows out there as well that might fit them.
I think that's part of one of the reasons we did

00:42:40.853 --> 00:42:45.894
this show, was we felt that there wasn't enough media
out there that represented friends having fun

00:42:45.894 --> 00:42:54.302
playing a game that was entertaining to people. So
we hoped it would fill that gap for some. We had a

00:42:54.302 --> 00:42:58.439
lot of people that have messaged us saying, "Well,
I showed the show to a few folks and they were

00:42:58.439 --> 00:43:02.524
"like, 'Oh, this is it? That looks like fun.'"
That's a way you can do it, you can always pass

00:43:02.524 --> 00:43:06.521
around episodes of our show or one of these other
great shows out there as an example to be like,

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:09.104
"No no no, it's just friends around a table
goofing off and improvising."

00:43:09.104 --> 00:43:11.274
MARY: Also, ale.

00:43:11.274 --> 00:43:13.844
(laughter)

00:43:13.844 --> 00:43:15.013
MARY: Bring beer.

00:43:15.013 --> 00:43:20.043
MATT: Aside from that, it's the way-- you've got
to explain it. Whenever anybody says, "What is

00:43:20.043 --> 00:43:22.732
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons?" Like when you asked me at the
beginning, "What is Dungeons &amp; Dragons?"

00:43:22.732 --> 00:43:23.729
MARY: What is it, yeah.

00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:27.672
MATT: I'm like, uhh, it's communal storytelling
and improv.

00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:28.745
MARY: Yeah.

00:43:28.745 --> 00:43:31.982
MATT: In a fantasy setting. It's like Lord of the
Rings, but you're just making it up as you go.

00:43:31.982 --> 00:43:35.823
MARY: That's how I describe it, I was like I'm
watching my friends make up Lord of the Rings. And

00:43:35.823 --> 00:43:43.454
it's-- with dice, so there's math, which sucks.
But that's good, too. You need math, so it hits

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:46.742
so many different levels. It's kind of amazing.

00:43:46.742 --> 00:43:50.422
MATT: What would you, as an outsider coming in
originally, what do you think would be the best

00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:52.633
way to describe it to you, if that's not it?

00:43:52.633 --> 00:44:06.344
MARY: That was it, to me. It's improv, I mean, it
was improv. It's come and play with your friends,

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:14.121
we're going to go into Rivendell. We're going to
create-- you want to be a wizard? You want to be

00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:18.722
a-- what do you want to be? You can be anything
you want. You get to choose who you want to be and

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:21.773
we're going to play. And create things and see
what happens.

00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:23.241
AMANDA: Thank you so much.

00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:25.488
MATT: You're welcome. If that doesn't work, send
them to me.

00:44:25.488 --> 00:44:27.852
(laughter)

00:44:27.852 --> 00:44:32.824
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, nice to see you guys. Mary,
I saw you yesterday. Hope to see you tomorrow, at

00:44:32.824 --> 00:44:34.725
your autograph signings.

00:44:34.725 --> 00:44:36.032
MATT: Come, do it.

00:44:36.032 --> 00:44:40.804
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is: what has been the
most interesting thing that a player has done in

00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:44.763
the game that was totally random, that you never
thought would happen?

00:44:44.763 --> 00:44:46.434
MARY: Cows.

00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:48.983
(laughter)

00:44:48.983 --> 00:44:56.503
MATT: Yeah man, Seeming an entire party into cows,
to try and masquerade as-- and to a certain

00:44:56.503 --> 00:45:04.632
extent, interrogate cows, as cows, varying sized
cows. Seeming messes everything up, I'm going to

00:45:04.632 --> 00:45:11.823
keep putting this out there. I love it. I love it.
Then having to chase down a roc, so cast Fly on

00:45:11.823 --> 00:45:18.432
the cows so you have a party of different-sized
flying cows across the moonlight. It's everything

00:45:18.432 --> 00:45:20.284
you hoped Amgen would have produced.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.274
(laughter)

00:45:22.274 --> 00:45:29.173
MATT: Oh my god, that was weird. I've had some
strange things happen. I've had some surprising

00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:36.295
things happen. I think really-- I'm sorry, it's
not because you're in the room, Shawn, I have to

00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:44.412
keep picking on you. Sorry. When you cut out
Jack's character's tongue was one of the most

00:45:44.412 --> 00:45:49.557
unexpected player things to ever happen in a
game.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.149
SHAWN: Well, to be fair, it was Jack.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.178
MATT: I know I know, he had it coming.

00:45:53.178 --> 00:45:58.008
MARY: So this was one of your regular players, and
you cut out his tongue?

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.477
SHAWN: Yeah. You don't know me that well, Mary.

00:46:01.514 --> 00:46:03.057
(laughing)

00:46:03.057 --> 00:46:07.307
MARY: No no. I don't. How did he adapt to this new
occurrence?

00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:09.906
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, how well did the young
Greyjoy adapt?

00:46:09.906 --> 00:46:19.875
MATT: Not very well. For him, his bard character
was a Vistani and was this very somewhat slimy,

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:28.028
charismatic in that I-can't-possibly-trust-you
ringmaster-y kind of way. Eventually he just got

00:46:28.028 --> 00:46:32.377
fed up with it, and the corruption had set in so
strongly, he just cut his tongue out. Jack played

00:46:32.377 --> 00:46:39.751
it as this now freaked-out, and then subservient,
quiet and--

00:46:39.826 --> 00:46:40.779
MARY: Theon.

00:46:40.779 --> 00:46:43.596
MATT: Yes, he would express his stuff through
character action, and describing what he was doing

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:48.334
emotionally, but couldn't actually say it. So it
would be like: "I bow my head and nod, and look

00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:53.305
"directly in his eyes and give him a look of
intense hatred, but then look away and walk." And

00:46:53.305 --> 00:46:54.779
I'm like: "All right!"

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:56.127
(laughter)

00:46:56.127 --> 00:46:57.257
MATT: This got real.

00:46:57.257 --> 00:46:58.907
(laughter)

00:46:58.907 --> 00:47:04.124
MARY: That's the other thing I love about it, is
that you have to say yes. If you get out there and

00:47:04.124 --> 00:47:09.877
you roll a 20 or whatever against someone else,
and they're like: "Don't do that to me!" it's

00:47:09.877 --> 00:47:18.166
like: "I rolled a 20." You have to say yes, or you
have to leave. It's great, it teaches you you have

00:47:18.166 --> 00:47:24.066
to deal with the shit you put out in the world and
everything, it's-- Consequences.

00:47:24.066 --> 00:47:29.941
MATT: Yeah. In a lot of games if one player had
cut out another player's tongue, that would have

00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:36.397
been a really tense, angry-- Real people being
angry like: "He can't do that, that's bullcrap!"

00:47:36.397 --> 00:47:43.898
You know, maybe. Or you could take it as a really
interesting character moment, the way Jack did,

00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:49.274
and play it into the personality, and now that's a
reason for the mute character to be silently

00:47:49.274 --> 00:47:53.976
plotting against the person who did it, or try to
find a way to get their tongue back, and their

00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:58.477
comeuppance against that player. That in itself
can be a really cool arc as well. I don't promote

00:47:58.477 --> 00:48:06.356
PvP in your games unless your players are really
into the idea and respectful of continuing the

00:48:06.356 --> 00:48:11.317
narrative, because that can go really south very
quickly if you're not being mature about it. But

00:48:11.317 --> 00:48:14.126
yeah, that's one of the weirder ones.

00:48:14.126 --> 00:48:17.777
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So thank you, and just saying
y'all's show did inspire me to go down to the

00:48:17.777 --> 00:48:20.748
gaming room downstairs and play my first game of
Dungeons and Dragons ever.

00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:21.660
MATT: Awesome!

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.044
MARY: Yay! What did you roll?

00:48:23.044 --> 00:48:29.146
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I decided to go with a half-orc
barbarian named Thok that I like to do the voice for.

00:48:29.146 --> 00:48:30.766
MATT and MARY: Yeah!

00:48:30.766 --> 00:48:32.374
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you guys.

00:48:32.374 --> 00:48:33.544
(cheering)

00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:35.396
MATT: That's awesome. Hello!

00:48:35.396 --> 00:48:37.998
AUDIENCE MATT: Hi, my name's Matt.

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.569
MATT: Good strong name.

00:48:39.569 --> 00:48:41.178
(laughter)

00:48:41.178 --> 00:48:45.397
AUDIENCE MATT: It is a good strong name, yes.
We've had this conversation before, in fact. So

00:48:45.397 --> 00:48:50.478
I've been playing mostly Pathfinder, but a couple
of different RPGs for a little while now, I don't

00:48:50.478 --> 00:48:52.618
get to play as often as I'd like. I've been very
blessed to have some very good DMs.

00:48:52.618 --> 00:48:53.582
MATT: Awesome

00:48:53.582 --> 00:48:59.156
AUDIENCE MATT: We just had a bit of a perfect
segue about how 20s can make things happen. I want

00:48:59.156 --> 00:49:06.806
to ask, there's those instances where a series of
20s and ones tend to make something go hilariously

00:49:06.806 --> 00:49:12.507
but horribly wrong. Do you have any experiences
like that? For example, we turned Fallout into

00:49:12.507 --> 00:49:17.498
Risk. It was a lot of ones and 20s.

00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:25.897
MATT: Okay. That's what I like about ones and 20s.
While in the system, technically in D&amp;D, rolling a

00:49:25.897 --> 00:49:33.314
20 on a skill check is isn't considered a critical
success necessarily, I consider that just lowering

00:49:33.314 --> 00:49:38.117
the DC on the skill check, because I think a 20
should be magical whenever it's rolled. I think

00:49:38.117 --> 00:49:42.626
that number is so intrinsically wonderful when you
see it on the table, that to roll that for a skill

00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:48.217
check and have it not really be just a high
number, I think that robs you of that moment. So I

00:49:48.217 --> 00:49:54.417
do give some sort of benefit. Like if Grog rolled
a 20 on an intelligence check a few times. That

00:49:54.417 --> 00:49:57.966
doesn't mean he suddenly has an encyclopedia in
his head, or that he knows exactly what he's

00:49:57.966 --> 00:50:01.916
trying to find out, but I'll give him a little bit
of information he otherwise might not have known.

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:06.204
Whether it be just an instinct or something he
remembered, he's like: "Oh yeah." You can find

00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:12.515
ways to work it into a game. But there have been a
number of encounters that have been steamrolled by

00:50:12.515 --> 00:50:22.036
a series of 20s. You guys watched Percy's crazy
20-a-thon butt flap orc death 2015.

00:50:22.036 --> 00:50:23.336
MARY: Yeah.

00:50:23.336 --> 00:50:27.175
MATT: That's going to be a bumper sticker, by the
way, that whole phrase.

00:50:27.175 --> 00:50:28.997
(laughter)

00:50:28.997 --> 00:50:34.386
MATT: There have been a series of social
encounters in games previously where a well-placed

00:50:34.386 --> 00:50:41.036
20 or series of 20s have lead into a complete
social upheaval in a city. Like overthrowing an

00:50:41.036 --> 00:50:48.039
individual who is in control of a market or a
political movement. We've had circumstances where

00:50:48.039 --> 00:50:59.057
a natural one ended up accidentally inciting the
entire town to turn on a party. We've had a series

00:50:59.057 --> 00:51:07.056
of unintentional 20s when you're trying to hold
back, end up in the death of what's supposed to be

00:51:07.056 --> 00:51:15.047
just a threatened individual. It's led to a lot of
very sticky situations, but conversely it's led to

00:51:15.047 --> 00:51:18.449
a lot of really great narrative moments. Nothing
really stands out in my head, because we've had

00:51:18.449 --> 00:51:19.696
quite a few of them.

00:51:19.696 --> 00:51:22.099
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Scanlan Shorthalt?

00:51:22.099 --> 00:51:32.997
MATT: Scanlan and Kaylie, that was one of those
natural ones-- When Scanlan's history caught up to

00:51:32.997 --> 00:51:40.197
him, and she was there to kill him, or at least
cut him down to the point where he would

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:47.847
understand the pain that she went through. Through
his speech, and she rolled a straight one-- Those

00:51:47.847 --> 00:51:52.086
are those perfect narrative moments. They don't
work out often, but every now and then you get

00:51:52.086 --> 00:51:55.865
that moment where it would be perfect if I had
critically succeeded or critically failed at this

00:51:55.865 --> 00:52:01.157
moment, and then it happens. That's the magic of
the game for me. Those are the moments you

00:52:01.157 --> 00:52:03.196
remember <i>forever.</i>

00:52:03.196 --> 00:52:06.255
AUDIENCE MATT: We basically killed an essential
NPC.

00:52:06.255 --> 00:52:16.786
MATT: Yeah. Good job, guys! That's a whole
questline you'll never touch again. Thank you. Hello!

00:52:16.786 --> 00:52:18.388
NATHAN: Hi there. I'm Nathan.

00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:19.886
MATT and MARY: Hi Nathan!

00:52:19.886 --> 00:52:23.496
NATHAN: I have no idea who you two are, I've
honestly never heard Critical Hit before, and this

00:52:23.496 --> 00:52:25.548
seems like a series I need to invest in.

00:52:25.548 --> 00:52:27.438
MARY: Have you ever played D&amp;D?

00:52:27.438 --> 00:52:33.625
NATHAN: I'll jump right to that. About two years
ago I just had a couple of friends invite me to play

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:40.246
D&amp;D just-- After so many years of avoiding it for
the social stigma that you referenced, decided to

00:52:40.246 --> 00:52:48.685
finally give it a shot, and the people who I was
with were amazing. Just playing with them, getting

00:52:48.685 --> 00:52:53.837
to know them, and getting to know their player--
it really is a whole separate meta when you play

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:59.347
it. But! Our DM was horrendous. Comically so.

00:52:59.347 --> 00:53:02.876
MARY: Like Showgirls bad, or?

00:53:02.876 --> 00:53:04.367
(laughter)

00:53:04.367 --> 00:53:06.599
MARY: I love Showgirls.

00:53:06.599 --> 00:53:10.580
NATHAN: He had the strange tendency of
wanting to constantly put us in danger, but never

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:19.231
kill a character. Which was a very strange kind of
presentation. It really speaks to the enjoyment of

00:53:19.231 --> 00:53:25.221
the game and the players, when we played for twice
a week for six months <i>hating</i> the game, and just

00:53:25.221 --> 00:53:30.571
enjoying hating it. After two years of playing--
Getting new players and whatnot, I'm finally going

00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:35.520
to try my hand at playing-- I didn't have your
magical quip, and I'm just going to start my own

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.588
after two years-- Had a lot of good experiences.
But what I wanted to ask you is, as a starting DM

00:53:41.588 --> 00:53:45.861
I know there's going to be so much I'm going to
learn, and clearly got tips and tricks videos I'm

00:53:45.861 --> 00:53:52.461
going to take a look at, but what I want to know
is: What major pitfall should I avoid? How should

00:53:52.461 --> 00:53:59.351
I avoid being that first DM that's absolutely
terrible-- That Showgirls DM for my very first party?

00:53:59.351 --> 00:54:06.739
MATT: My biggest recommendation is: Start small.
If you're doing homebrew, if you're making your

00:54:06.739 --> 00:54:12.239
own world: Start small. If you're running a
pre-made adventure or module it can be a little

00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:14.981
easier, especially for your first time because a
lot of the information is already provided for

00:54:14.981 --> 00:54:20.812
you. But if you're creating your own story: Start
small. You get stuck in this world-building aspect

00:54:20.812 --> 00:54:26.071
of trying to build a whole continent, a whole
culture-- multicultures and political structure

00:54:26.071 --> 00:54:29.479
between these two sides and all of a sudden your
party is like: "We're going to spend the next six

00:54:29.479 --> 00:54:37.452
"months in <i>this</i> city." You're like: "But I built
all this... Okay." So start on that city. Build a

00:54:37.452 --> 00:54:42.689
small town or a small farm village or wherever you
want them to start, and just focus on fleshing out

00:54:42.689 --> 00:54:49.410
that small area. Consider the major NPCs, who they
interact with positively or negatively. What's the

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:55.913
antagonistic force in that area that's going to be
driving the story? What type of character intrigue

00:54:55.913 --> 00:55:01.641
can you input in this small little cluster of
people, and then once they start playing it, their

00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:05.630
decisions will begin to inform your worldbuilding.
How they interact with these people, what kind of

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.520
things that their characters are interested in
finding in the story, will inform you of what kind

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.553
of things you can put into the world down the
road that will really hook them and get them

00:55:14.553 --> 00:55:20.241
interested in the story as they progress. So start
small, have some big ideas and take notes on

00:55:20.241 --> 00:55:25.621
things you would like to build in the long run,
but don't overwork yourself creating everything at

00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:31.413
once, and have only this much be seen for a year.
That's my biggest recommendation, because all of

00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:36.993
that effort you put into a smaller area will
make that small area so much more fleshed out and

00:55:36.993 --> 00:55:41.534
lively and real in their minds, and really give
you, the DM, the confidence of knowing that

00:55:41.534 --> 00:55:46.441
whatever they do in this little area, you have a
really strong idea of where it might go and how

00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:49.881
you can react to their decisions. That's my
biggest recommendation.

00:55:49.881 --> 00:55:50.802
NATHAN: Thank you.

00:55:50.802 --> 00:55:51.833
MATT: No worries.

00:55:51.833 --> 00:55:54.718
MARY: We have about five minutes left, so let's
see if we can go really fast and we can get all of

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:55.892
you guys done.

00:55:55.892 --> 00:55:57.304
BLAKE: Hey, my name is Blake.

00:55:57.304 --> 00:55:58.352
MARY: Hey Blake.

00:55:58.352 --> 00:56:06.842
BLAKE: The question I had is: What was the saddest
moment you've had DMing, other than Pike's death?

00:56:06.842 --> 00:56:14.221
One of those moments where it happened, and you
had to do it, but you felt bad doing it. Other

00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:15.751
than killing a player.

00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:23.793
MATT: Other than killing a player? Killing my city
of Emon. Man, building a town over two and a half,

00:56:23.793 --> 00:56:28.470
three years and having it be like a central
location to the story and the characters' world,

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:34.111
and where they live and everyone they love lives,
for the most part, and it's the political center.

00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:39.676
And then having to, because it was the narrative I
built, where the world was going and where the

00:56:39.676 --> 00:56:44.702
story needed to be, come in and just smash it.
Just kick all my Legos over.

00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:47.293
MARY: But it was such a cool way to do it.

00:56:47.293 --> 00:56:48.383
MATT: Oh, it was fun.

00:56:48.383 --> 00:56:49.622
MARY: Oh, such a cool way.

00:56:49.622 --> 00:56:50.632
MATT: Weirdly cathartic.

00:56:50.632 --> 00:56:52.823
BLAKE: Thank you.

00:56:52.823 --> 00:56:55.619
MATT: You're welcome. In a stomp my own sandcastle
kind of way.

00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:59.641
MARY: Yeah! Rawr, you played Godzilla in your own
Tokyo.

00:56:59.641 --> 00:57:01.173
MATT: Basically. Hello!

00:57:01.173 --> 00:57:02.434
SEAN: Hi, my name is Sean.

00:57:02.434 --> 00:57:03.361
MATT: Hey Sean.

00:57:03.361 --> 00:57:07.753
SEAN: So there has been a fad going around, I'm
not sure if you've heard of it, called out of

00:57:07.753 --> 00:57:09.484
context D&amp;D quotes.

00:57:09.484 --> 00:57:13.062
(laughter)

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.054
MARY: Oh.

00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:19.401
SEAN: So this is lines from different campaigns,
that, when taken completely out of their original

00:57:19.401 --> 00:57:24.512
settings, sound hysterical. An example of a
campaign that I started thanks to you guys: "No,

00:57:24.512 --> 00:57:28.121
"your familiar cannot hold a spear. It is made of
spaghetti."

00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:29.651
(laughter)

00:57:29.651 --> 00:57:34.991
SEAN: Are there any lines like that, or
moments of the show, either Critical Role, or any

00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:40.503
other campaign you've had, that for people who may
not have seen the show may really enjoy.

00:57:40.503 --> 00:57:44.356
MATT: Sure. I'm not going to be able to quote
things exactly from memory, but something along

00:57:44.356 --> 00:57:59.122
the lines of: "Okay, I'm going to focus on the
poop in a jar. What can I see around me?" That's one.

00:57:59.122 --> 00:58:02.582
(laughter)

00:58:02.582 --> 00:58:03.891
MATT: Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen.

00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:05.519
MARY: Woohoo!

00:58:05.519 --> 00:58:12.173
STEFAN: Hi. My name is Stefan. Do you play Final
Fantasy?

00:58:12.173 --> 00:58:16.021
(laughter)

00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:17.042
STEFAN: I'm sorry.

00:58:17.042 --> 00:58:22.700
(cheering)

00:58:22.716 --> 00:58:24.739
MATT: Yes.

00:58:24.774 --> 00:58:31.182
STEFAN: Yes, I have a question about the new game
that's coming out, Final Fantasy XV. Would that

00:58:31.182 --> 00:58:35.073
one have online-- Like open roam like Final
Fantasy XIV?

00:58:35.073 --> 00:58:43.572
MATT: I don't know. As far as I know from the
game, I don't think it's multiplayer, but I think

00:58:43.572 --> 00:58:48.780
they're making it a little more open world, like
you can wander around the map. It's not like Final

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:53.397
Fantasy X where you had an airship and you pick
places and it drops you down there. I think it's a

00:58:53.397 --> 00:58:58.861
little more open world wandering, from what I've
seen in the trailers. But it's not multiplayer

00:58:58.861 --> 00:59:03.142
like XIV is, if that's what your question means.

00:59:03.142 --> 00:59:06.331
STEFAN: Oh. Okay. Yeah, that was my question.

00:59:06.331 --> 00:59:10.051
MATT: As far as I know. But when I find out I'll
let you know. I promise.

00:59:10.051 --> 00:59:11.052
STEFAN: All right, thank you.

00:59:11.052 --> 00:59:12.080
MATT: Thanks, buddy.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.477
MARY: Okay quick, we only have a minute left.

00:59:13.477 --> 00:59:14.881
MATT: We can do this, we can do this.

00:59:14.881 --> 00:59:19.242
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fist of all, I just wanted to
thank you guys for sharing what is normally such

00:59:19.242 --> 00:59:24.020
an intimate experience with everyone. On behalf of
everyone here and thousands of people on the internet.

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.302
MARY: That's because of you, Matt.

00:59:26.302 --> 00:59:29.992
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm actually here with my
players, everyone in my current campaign is here today.

00:59:29.992 --> 00:59:30.869
MATT: Awesome!

00:59:30.869 --> 00:59:34.670
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm starting to run another one
for some people who felt left out, and then my

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:38.362
current players wanted to play, and all of a
sudden I've got nine people and two beasts hanging

00:59:38.362 --> 00:59:41.451
out that I'm going to have to run combat for.

00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:43.461
MATT: I feel your pain.

00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:45.057
(laughter)

00:59:45.057 --> 00:59:47.292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I actually thought you would
be a terrific person to ask if I could get up

00:59:47.292 --> 00:59:52.203
here: What are some of the ways that you raise the
bar, not just in combat, to make things

00:59:52.203 --> 00:59:54.452
challenging for that amount of people?

00:59:54.452 --> 01:00:01.901
MATT: A general sliding scale I go for, because--
Adding just more hit points means it can go on for

01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:07.271
a long time. For scaling. So, I mean, adding more
hit points does help to have enemies have

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.832
longevity, especially when you have that many
players, because that's a lot of damage that can

01:00:09.832 --> 01:00:15.193
be dished out in a combat round. My recommendation
is to also increase the damage that can be done by

01:00:15.193 --> 01:00:20.782
these creatures. Because you'll get fewer rounds
of combat with more players, but to still keep it

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:26.019
dangerous, have the damage they take from certain
attacks be large enough to the point where it

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:31.410
really is dangerous. Or conversely, consider
adding abilities to certain creatures that are

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:37.202
area of effect attacks. You can customize any
monster they come across. The Monster Manual are

01:00:37.202 --> 01:00:41.191
just templates, and suggestions of how to run
these things. You can customize however you want.

01:00:41.191 --> 01:00:46.207
So if you want that beholder to be really nasty
against nine players, perhaps it has an eye wipe

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:51.213
ability that chooses to do one eye ray attack on
everything within a 20 foot radius. How will that

01:00:51.213 --> 01:00:52.603
do against nine players?

01:00:52.603 --> 01:00:53.892
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're evil.

01:00:53.892 --> 01:00:59.642
MATT: I'm just saying. There are ways you can
customize creatures to be more of a threat to

01:00:59.642 --> 01:01:02.681
multiple entities. And, yeah, because a lot of
single target attacks will be less effective

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:05.843
against larger groups, think of ways that you can
give them big sweeping attacks that can hit

01:01:05.843 --> 01:01:12.172
multiple guys at once. Or things that can lock
down and grapple multiple players at a distance

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:16.061
and make them ineffective for a round or two.
Like, those are ways you can still make it

01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:21.323
threatening for that many players without having
to just give them 400 more hit points, and it

01:01:21.323 --> 01:01:23.490
becomes a huge slog fest.

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:24.912
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

01:01:24.912 --> 01:01:28.153
MARY: We are out of time. One more! One more.

01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:29.113
MATT: One more; one more!

01:01:29.113 --> 01:01:30.251
MEGAN: Okay. Hi, guys.

01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:31.663
MARY and MATT: Hi, Megan!

01:01:31.663 --> 01:01:32.491
MEGAN: Hi!

01:01:32.491 --> 01:01:33.352
MARY: How are you?

01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:43.883
MEGAN: I'm good. I know. I'm trying to be quick
best I can. What is the biggest inspiring and

01:01:43.883 --> 01:01:50.353
influentional of Keyleth.

01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:51.792
MARY: Of Keyleth?

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:52.881
MEGAN: And Zahra.

01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.862
MARY: Oh, what was...?

01:01:54.862 --> 01:01:56.423
MATT: Most influential for your character?

01:01:56.423 --> 01:01:58.362
MARY: What was most influential for me? Wow.

01:01:58.362 --> 01:02:09.783
MATT: While you think about that... For Keyleth, I
know Marisha, for her it was partially <i>Avatar:</i>

01:02:09.783 --> 01:02:14.792
<i>the Last Airbender</i>. She's a huge fan of the
series. So when she created a druid, she wanted to

01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:22.686
go that elemental, trying to learn, to master
different tribes of elemental types. Which has

01:02:22.686 --> 01:02:28.862
been kind of a cool journey for her character.
Also, because Marisha, as you may have noticed,

01:02:28.862 --> 01:02:36.084
she's a tough chick. She's, like, really
confident, and that's why I like her. You know.

01:02:36.084 --> 01:02:40.633
She's the fighter; I'm the diplomat. It works out
fine. She defends my honor.

01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:43.022
(laughter)

01:02:43.022 --> 01:02:46.534
MATT: So for her, she wanted to choose a character
that was very against type for her. She wanted to

01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:49.721
play a character that was very different than what
she would normally play, or who she is. So for

01:02:49.721 --> 01:02:55.490
Keyleth, she wanted to make someone that was, you
know, very awkward and insecure and trying to find

01:02:55.490 --> 01:03:00.416
her place in the world. And like with any D&amp;D
character, you learn a lot about yourself as you

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:05.252
play a character. It's hard to not be made a
better person through these experiences. And so

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:08.790
she attributes-- While that was her inspiration
for Keyleth, Keyleth has also been an inspiration

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:13.480
to her. And she's learned to be more in touch with
that aspect of herself as well. So that's been

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.201
really inspirational for her.

01:03:15.247 --> 01:03:16.404
MARY: Yeah.

01:03:16.404 --> 01:03:21.871
MEGAN: I'm much like Keyleth. I'm very awkward and
have a lot of self-esteem issues as well.

01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:26.261
MATT: Hey, we all are in many ways. I think we can
all agree on that.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:33.551
MARY: It's probably why we all get along so well.
For Zahra, I looked at all the different classes

01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:37.601
and-- because, again, I was brand new to this
world-- and I really looked at the group dynamic,

01:03:37.601 --> 01:03:44.919
and I thought, What's missing? What's not there?
So I saw, okay, warlock, and then I was doing

01:03:44.919 --> 01:03:50.059
research online. (mumbles) "I don't know if I
should do that or not." And somebody posted

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:55.190
something about, you know, badass tiefling
warlock, and I said, "Okay. Well, there's no

01:03:55.190 --> 01:04:03.541
"tieflings there. So let's try that." And I found
out as I went. Again, as I said before, I sort of

01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:09.499
started with myself in terms of the personality,
and the moon and everything else, and someone who

01:04:09.499 --> 01:04:16.679
was-- I don't know. I think she's kinder and more
eloquent than I am, you know? So that helps me,

01:04:16.679 --> 01:04:22.459
you know? Because I can be sort of, I'm from
Jersey; I get a little brash every now and then.

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:29.102
So I think she's a more elegant creature than I
am, which is nice. You know. That will still use

01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:33.761
the Finger of Death on Keyleth within five minutes
of a knock-down-drag-out. She mentioned that the

01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:38.710
other night. I was like, "Oh, sorry, Marisha."
But, yeah, we're not here to play tiddlywinks.

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:40.360
We're here to destroy.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.271
MATT: Thank you.

01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:42.892
MEGAN: All right, then. Thank you so much, guys.
Thank you.

01:04:42.892 --> 01:04:45.382
MARY: Thanks, Megan. Thanks, you guys. I'm so
sorry.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:50.116
MATT: So sorry. If we didn't get to your question,
if you see us around the convention, feel free to

01:04:50.116 --> 01:04:54.483
stop us and ask. Or come to another panel, or come
to our signing and ask us. Or shoot me a message

01:04:54.483 --> 01:04:55.472
on Twitter.

01:04:55.472 --> 01:04:58.782
MARY: I'm going to a signing right now, so if you
want to come down I've got some great Kit Buss

01:04:58.782 --> 01:05:03.734
artwork of the kill shot on Rimefang. So come and
check it out. It's really fun.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:04.932
MATT: Thank you guys so much.

01:05:04.932 --> 01:05:07.962
MARY: Bye, guys! Thank you! Roll 20s.

01:05:07.962 --> 01:05:40.774
