1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,999
MARISHA: And I cast my Skywrite spell-- ew, I just
spit-- and I use the smoke in the distance and as

2
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:16,309
it's rising up into the sky, start drawing out the
de Rolo family crest in the smoke.

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,645
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the plume of smoke
and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make

4
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:28,295
the smoke go to a thicker, thicker black and take
the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air

5
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:32,750
until eventually we have a very well-defined de
Rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,008
Whitestone.

7
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,293
SAM: Oh! Something's happening! Something's
happening in the sky!

8
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:38,700
MARISHA: That's me.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,252
SAM: I think it's a magic wielder of some sort.
Something-- I must flee!

10
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,311
(laughter)

11
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:53,239
MATT: All right. Investigation checks from both of
you.

12
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,071
LAURA: Okay.

13
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,349
TRAVIS: Did I find anything on Smash-Face?

14
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,510
LIAM: (sighs) That's what you rolled the last
time.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,523
LAURA: I know!

16
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:01,719
TALIESIN: 16.

17
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,194
LAURA: I've got to put this one away for a while.

18
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,329
MATT: What did you roll?

19
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,680
LAURA: I rolled a nine.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,059
MATT: Okay. The two of you take a while upstairs
looking about the rooms. You manage to acquire

21
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:20,877
from just some of the local bits of cabinets and
dust, you gather about 230 gold pieces.

22
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,292
LAURA: 230?

23
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:27,191
MATT: Just loose gold pieces that are around.
There is a nice jewelry box that seems to contain

24
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:31,314
most of the jewels and gems that this individual
likes.

25
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,430
LAURA: I'm going to take the whole jewelry box and
sort through it later.

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,539
MATT: Okay. So say a box of Tylieri's jewelry
would be what you've marked down.

27
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,349
TALIESIN: Tylieri family jewels.

28
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,113
(laughter)

29
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:43,431
TALIESIN: That won't be confusing at all.

30
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:46,716
MATT: There you go. You do notice, however, that's
all you're able to find for the most part, other than

31
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:51,111
some few bits of clothing and outfit. The master
bedroom has no bed.

32
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,477
LAURA: Does he sleep in a coffin?

33
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:58,175
TALIESIN: We're going to finish searching
downstairs and then find the entrance to the--

34
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:59,475
MATT: Okay.

35
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:02,712
LIAM: I'd like to wind my way up there, as well.

36
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:05,390
MATT: Okay, as you make your way up there you
notice them stepping out.

37
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,316
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still curious. I want to go have a
look as well.

38
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,986
MATT: Go for it. Investigation.

39
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:11,477
LAURA: That's better, thank you.

40
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:13,307
LIAM: 16.

41
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:17,779
MATT: 16? You look through the room. Most
everything of interest has already been picked

42
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:24,586
clean. This room also doesn't seem to see much use
other than the clothing that's in there. This room

43
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:28,202
is used for dressing and presentational purposes
but other than that, as a bedroom, it's pretty

44
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:34,957
useless. As you guys go downstairs, we'll say for
the sake of brevity you take a little bit of time

45
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:38,249
to start looking through. You know you're a little
pressed for time because you can feel the energy

46
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:41,176
in the town begin to rise and you start hearing
noises. You keeping an eye out?

47
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,148
MARISHA: Yeah.

48
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:44,728
MATT: The people that rush into the rooms are now
rushing back out, some of them wearing leather

49
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:49,317
tunics and small bits of armor, their weapons
gathered, and they're forming small bands.

50
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:54,808
MARISHA: I come over the speakers once again, the
ear pieces. "I think it's time to go. Whenever you

51
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,007
"guys are ready, I want to light this bitch up."

52
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,452
TRAVIS: We need to check all the rooms that go
downstairs first.

53
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,750
MARISHA: All right, quick.

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,756
TRAVIS: "Got an empty house." I run out to the
door to the left. To the uncovered areas.

55
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:10,710
MATT: Okay. You go over to this hallway. You
eventually smash the door, doesn't take too long.

56
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:19,657
It leads into what looks like a small study or
some sort of an office room. A big blue rug, a

57
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,318
desk with a chair, some papers strewn about.

58
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,772
TRAVIS: Can I grab the rug and yank it?

59
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,239
MATT: Yeah, pull the rug off, reveals a hatch.

60
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,421
TRAVIS: (excited shouting) I found a hatch!

61
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,540
LAURA: (cries out in pain) No need to yell!

62
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,628
TRAVIS: Oh sorry. (quieter) I found a hatch.

63
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:38,690
TALIESIN: Quick, I just want to do a quick round
of the downstairs room before going to the hatch.

64
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,490
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you find what looks to
be a general sitting area, a music room, or a

65
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:49,769
place where you would host guests. Also in fair disuse.
And then beyond that, you find a room that's

66
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,494
pretty bland, with a staircase that leads down
into what was once servants' quarters that has

67
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:57,209
been converted into a torture room.

68
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,649
LAURA: Oh, lovely.

69
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:04,368
MATT: It's a little nicer in its presentation and
tools than the duergar torture room that you

70
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:10,348
encountered in the Underdark, but this looks to be
like Tylieri had a definite interest in

71
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:14,970
entertaining unwanted guests.

72
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,685
TALIESIN: Okay.

73
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:20,499
TRAVIS: Vax or Vex, will you come check this hatch
for boobies?

74
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:22,438
(laughter)

75
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,236
LIAM: I jog on down.

76
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:26,549
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

77
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:30,079
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 23.

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,179
MATT: Yeah, it does not appear to be trapped.

79
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,449
TRAVIS: No boobies.

80
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,317
LIAM: Okay. You want to open that, big guy?

81
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,701
TRAVIS: Yeah! (growls)

82
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:44,923
MATT: (vroom) The hatch comes up. There is no
ladder; it's just a ten-foot drop down into a

83
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:45,879
basement.

84
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,242
TRAVIS: Okay, I jump.

85
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:52,750
MATT: Land down there. A 20 foot by 20 foot room.
It's very musty. However, you do see in the far

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,718
corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up, and
there is a dark box.

87
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,414
TRAVIS: Um.

88
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:00,653
MATT: About eight feet long.

89
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:04,090
LIAM: I hear him say "Um," and I jump down, too.
With the Flametongue dagger out for light.

90
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,456
MATT: Okay. The room lights up a little bit and
you can see across the way there is a not

91
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:12,255
super-detailed, but a fairly well-crafted coffin
on the opposite side of the room.

92
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:16,196
TRAVIS: Ooh! I bet there's treasure in there!

93
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:19,243
LIAM: You might be right. Yeah, let's go have a
look.

94
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,028
LAURA: Is there treasure? Did you find treasure?

95
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:27,407
LIAM: "Hold, please." Perception check the coffin.
That's a 20.

96
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:32,249
MATT: Okay. The coffin does not appear to be
trapped?

97
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,186
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

98
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,924
MARISHA: He said that with a question mark.

99
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,645
MATT: It's always fun to do that.

100
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:41,659
TRAVIS: Well, should I just smash it?

101
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,984
LIAM: I really feel like this could be--

102
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,261
LAURA: Smash it!

103
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:50,549
TRAVIS: Three, two. Grog smashes.

104
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,908
LIAM: I kick it off with the end of my foot.
Little bit. Or try to.

105
00:05:53,908 --> 00:06:00,116
MATT: Okay. (boof) The lid flies off and then
slams on the ground. A smell hits you that's just

106
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:08,678
like musty old mildewed earth. The inside of the
coffin is, it's lined with like a fine purplish

107
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:13,748
velvet material, the smell quickly fades. It looks
like there are some small baubles in there,

108
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:22,248
keepsakes. There is what looks to be a cape or a
cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for

109
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,061
comfort.

110
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,729
LIAM: Roll it up. Put it into my satchel. I'm
going to take a dagger out and I want to cut all

111
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:32,428
the way up through that purple velvet. Just see,
just in case.

112
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:36,840
MATT: Okay. You cut through the purple velvet.
Rummage through underneath. It appears to be the

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,169
back of the box.

114
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,723
TALIESIN: I'm going to check his desk upstairs for
anything interesting.

115
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:45,339
MATT: Okay. Want to make an investigation check?

116
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,958
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

117
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:56,119
MATT: As you're rummaging through the notes in the
desk, a lot of them are ledgers involving the

118
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,058
trade in and out of the city. He has his hands
dabbling in elements of the timber trade, elements

119
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:08,135
of the actual trade of whitestone. He talks about
the-- and you understand, the reason that

120
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:13,735
Whitestone itself is-- the stone that's mined here
is so popular for construction and architecture

121
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:22,295
and other elements is the stone that these
mountains are made of, when properly prepared,

122
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:28,851
there is a faint bit of residuum that is naturally
ingrained in the rock here. No one really knows

123
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,972
how it came about, but whatever it is, while it is
not inherently magical, it makes it a little bit

124
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:38,876
easier, faster, and cheaper to enchant the stone.
So when it comes to, you know, enchanting a

125
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:46,172
teleportation circle permanently somewhere or for
traps or things-- not actual objects but actually

126
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:52,081
enchanting anything made of stonework. It's easier
to enchant, and that's why the whitestone of this

127
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:58,182
area is sought after and a good trade element. So
there's notes about that. But the stone trade has

128
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:03,271
been halted, all stone has continued to be mined,
but it's not being transported.

129
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:06,022
TRAVIS: Is the desk made out of the stone?

130
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:12,451
MATT: No, there's just notes about it. So all the
whitestone that is being mined is not being

131
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,731
exported. It's being kept here, somewhere.

132
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,887
LAURA: They're making something big.

133
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,149
TALIESIN: They're making something big.

134
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:19,562
LIAM: I think we need to get out of here.

135
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,969
TRAVIS: I was going to ask, are you good with the
coffin?

136
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,321
LIAM: Yeah.

137
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,842
TRAVIS: Okay. I smash the shit out of it, in an
effort to see what's underneath.

138
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,746
MATT: Okay. You take about 30 seconds of extreme
violence against the wooden coffin, killing it

139
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:39,347
into chunks and blocks. You get the feeling that
this may have been the place the mist was

140
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:50,111
trying to get to. But it did not make its journey.
It got scattered by druid Sunbeam and destroyed,

141
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:56,452
and the coffin is left in ruins. You do-- even you,
Grog-- absorb the fact that when a vampire goes to

142
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:01,232
mist form, you get the feeling that this is the
home it needs to come to, to try and survive.

143
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:03,123
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

144
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,902
MATT: Not anymore. Not that one.

145
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,775
MARISHA: Do I see anyone coming?

146
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:13,371
MATT: Oh. You see another zombie giant coming up
the way. You can see people attacking it, it's

147
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:16,849
just thrashing them about, but this one seems less
bothered by the group and is now moving towards a

148
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:21,921
specific area, moving towards the fiery plume
in the distance. They're all gathering in that

149
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,876
direction.

150
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,430
MARISHA: But no one seems to be rushing towards
this house?

151
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,446
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

152
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:27,047
TRAVIS: This one's not on fire. Yet.

153
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:34,228
MATT: All right, you all gather, you can hear the
rainstorm itself is coming down in sheets. What

154
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,467
do you want to do?

155
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,861
TRAVIS: Light this candle!

156
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,599
LAURA: Should we light this on fire, too?

157
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,224
TALIESIN: Burn it to the ground.

158
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:44,394
MARISHA: "Everyone out." And I start casting a
Flaming Sphere.

159
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,635
MATT: Okay.

160
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:46,876
TRAVIS: We're out by now.

161
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,002
MARISHA: Everyone out.

162
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:51,765
MATT: You guys all step out into the rain
(whooshes) pouring down. What bits of guard blood

163
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,965
that have been pressed against you washes off.

164
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,174
TRAVIS: Aw.

165
00:09:55,174 --> 00:10:01,784
MARISHA: I peek in this foyer. And just (boof),
right in the middle, and take a minute to

166
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,710
move it all around.

167
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:07,643
MATT: A Flaming Sphere begins to corkscrew around
this room, up over the banister, up to the upper

168
00:10:07,643 --> 00:10:13,227
area, and like an artist, you paint this entire
room with flame until the entire interior of this

169
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:18,664
main foyer is just an inferno. You can hear the
flames licking and the light is very bright. You

170
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:24,172
end up backing up and you can see people,
unarmored folk in nearby homes that are pressed up

171
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:28,851
against their windows watching this happen and
whispering to each other. The children, those that

172
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:33,065
are kept guarded and are not part of this
rebellion, they are watching this with smiles.

173
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:38,084
MARISHA: Okay, I think that's good enough.
Let's go.

174
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,109
TALIESIN: Head back to the curiosity shop.

175
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,204
LAURA: Yeah, sneaky, stealthing.

176
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,647
MATT: Okay. As you guys run off into the alley
behind--

177
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,474
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace I cast on all of us.

178
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:50,665
MATT: Okay. How many more spells do you have at
that level? Because you used it several times

179
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:51,594
today.

180
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:55,286
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine with Pass Without a Trace.
That's a 1st-level. 2nd-level, but I'm fine.

181
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,736
TALIESIN: Back to the alcove, then?

182
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:02,035
MATT: You guys all dart off into the alley under
the cover of the shadows of the storm and the

183
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,004
rainfall, to head towards the alcove, and we'll go
ahead and take a quick break.

184
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,535
(cheering)

185
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,982
MATT: A quick break, I know I always say that, I'm
not going to say five minutes, but.

186
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:10,218
SAM: This one's a real quick break.

187
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,745
MATT: We'll take it real quick because we want to
try and get through as much of the story before we

188
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,293
get to Critmas.

189
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:14,215
LAURA: Critmas!

190
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,245
LIAM: Critmas! Crimmas.

191
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:16,246
TALIESIN: Oh dear god.

192
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:17,116
TRAVIS: It's going to be a thing.

193
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,293
MATT: Which is going to, which is going to take
some time tonight. Be back here in a few minutes

194
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,275
guys, we'll see you in a sec.

195
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,046
TRAVIS: Pizza!

196
00:11:20,046 --> 00:25:30,878
[break]

197
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:36,732
MATT: Welcome back. So. Jumping back into the
chaos, the party has scattered back into the

198
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:42,191
rainstorm. I would like everyone to make a stealth
check.

199
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,853
LAURA: Oh, right. Plus ten for everybody.

200
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:45,340
MATT: Plus ten.

201
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,657
LIAM: I did all right.

202
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:52,547
TALIESIN: I rolled my disadvantage.

203
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:54,819
TRAVIS: Does it matter on a one?

204
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,180
MATT: All right.

205
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,554
TRAVIS: Ten?

206
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:00,950
MATT: Total ten?

207
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,946
TRAVIS: Total ten. 11.

208
00:26:02,946 --> 00:26:04,596
LAURA: 11, technically.

209
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,841
MATT: Okay.

210
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:07,120
LAURA: 29.

211
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,378
LIAM: 43.

212
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:10,542
SAM: I'm not there.

213
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:12,252
TRAVIS: 43?

214
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:18,001
MATT: Well, you're making your own stealth,
though. You're invisible, so just roll twice.

215
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,271
SAM: Natural 20.

216
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,772
MARISHA: 28.

217
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:22,102
TALIESIN: 30.

218
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:28,743
MATT: Okay. So making up for the bounding chaos
that is Grog throughout the city, you manage to

219
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:34,893
still make your way largely as a group stealthed
to-- are you heading to the alcove, you said?

220
00:26:34,964 --> 00:26:38,620
TALIESIN: That's where we had our little
crash-base set up, right?

221
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:46,901
MATT: Correct. All right. You make your way to the
alcove. As you're darting through, you can see in

222
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:54,472
the distance small pocketed sounds of yells and
the occasional sound of some sort of large-scale

223
00:26:54,472 --> 00:27:00,493
crumbling or crashing of wood and stone.
Occasionally, darting past the streets, you see

224
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:10,872
militant occupants of Whitestone: armored, rushing
through, shouting orders to each other, some

225
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:17,013
coming back wounded and helping their friends
back. The midday rebellion has definitely started,

226
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:22,583
and you get the sense that the initial surprise
has been effective, but the longer this runs, the

227
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:28,558
longer this wears on, the more and more of a body
count this will be.

228
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,766
TRAVIS: Seeing the chaos, can I get the Dust of
Tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it

229
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:34,674
behind us?

230
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:35,943
MATT: Yeah.

231
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:37,669
MARISHA: Guys, we should do something.

232
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,034
LAURA: I know, we really should.

233
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,703
SAM: Am I with these guys yet?

234
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:47,106
MATT: You have not, but you all meet up back at
the alcove, communicating over your earpieces. You

235
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:50,947
make your way to the front of the building. The
doors are closed and locked.

236
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:53,642
LIAM: The alcove?

237
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,822
TRAVIS: Closed and locked?

238
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:59,311
LIAM: I'll see about that. I'm going to check the
door.

239
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,884
MATT: Go for it.

240
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:05,204
LIAM: That is ten. 23.

241
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:07,924
MATT: Okay. Seems to be a fairly simple lock.

242
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:09,029
LIAM: All right.

243
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:10,948
TRAVIS: Look for an ambush around. Can we look
around?

244
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:12,288
LAURA: Yeah, perceive it?

245
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,988
TRAVIS: Rooftops? Sides of the building?

246
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:15,553
MATT: Make a perception check, guys.

247
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:16,804
MARISHA: All of us?

248
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,352
SAM: Me too?

249
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,658
MATT: Not you, you haven't gotten there yet.

250
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,427
LIAM: 20.

251
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:24,853
TRAVIS: I actually rolled a 17.

252
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:25,873
MARISHA: 12.

253
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:26,874
TALIESIN: 24.

254
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:27,781
LAURA: 26.

255
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:34,803
MATT: Okay. Looking about, there doesn't appear to
be any set ambush or anybody else here. You do

256
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:39,405
hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps in the
interior.

257
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:43,606
LAURA: Should we knock on the door?

258
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,014
TRAVIS: Canvass the building.

259
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:51,179
LIAM: I can get in there and see who that is. I
can go in, yeah.

260
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,735
LAURA: They're right on the inside.

261
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,827
LIAM: I thought it was upstairs, or you said right
on the other side of the door?

262
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:58,538
LAURA: Right on the other side of the door.

263
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:05,194
MARISHA: Oh, for crying out loud. I push past
them I just go, Jordana! Jordana, it's us!

264
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:10,074
MATT: Okay, there's a pause and a voice goes,
"Who's us?"

265
00:29:10,074 --> 00:29:12,640
LAURA: Oh. Crazy grandma!

266
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,724
MARISHA: And Vox Machina. (quietly) Does she know
we're called that?

267
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:20,487
LAURA: No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy grandma
was staying with you. Crazy peasants.

268
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,888
MARISHA: Allies.

269
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,615
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

270
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:28,179
MARISHA: Son of a-- nine?

271
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,832
LAURA: Can I help?

272
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:31,986
LAURA AND MARISHA: Crazy grandma!

273
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:33,774
MARISHA: Crazy grandma can help!

274
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:37,073
MATT: I'll say since you're backing her failure
up, go ahead and make it with disadvantage.

275
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:41,781
MARISHA: Hey, you don't have to call it-- that
sounds so sad when you say it like that.

276
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,006
LAURA: 18.

277
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:54,434
MATT: 18. There's a pause. "Crazy grandma? Come
in." You hear the sound of a locking sound and the

278
00:29:54,434 --> 00:30:00,482
door opens up ever-so-slightly. A very, very dimly
lit interior, there's a small lantern, a hooded

279
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,790
lantern across the room. Other than that, you see
the shadow of Jordana as she ushers you all in out

280
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,065
of the rain.

281
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:08,785
LAURA: So, hey guess what? It's started.

282
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:15,211
MATT: "Yeah, apparently." She closes the door
behind you, looks out the window that has the

283
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:22,975
curtains closed and goes, "Okay. So. It's
underway. It's not safe to be here right now."

284
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,105
LAURA: No.

285
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:26,164
MATT: "Did anyone see you come in?"

286
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:27,669
LAURA: No, no.

287
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:32,872
MATT: "Good. Who are you?"

288
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:39,973
LAURA: "Oh. Well." How about Seeming? This whole
time, have we looked like

289
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,492
crazy peasants during the battle?

290
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:42,388
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

291
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:43,290
TRAVIS: We dropped it.

292
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,142
LAURA: We dropped it?

293
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,260
MATT: You dropped Seeming before all of this.

294
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,658
LAURA: Okay, just making sure Trinket wasn't a
donkey that killed the--

295
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:48,488
MATT: No.

296
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:50,057
TALIESIN: That would've been intense and awesome.

297
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,176
MATT: That would've been amazing. Donkey eating a
vampire head? Aw, man.

298
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:57,824
LIAM: This is hard to believe, but this is crazy
grandma.

299
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:02,586
LAURA: "I'm crazy grandma." I do a crazy eye thing
just to show her.

300
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:05,620
SAM: Am I there, Matt?

301
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,586
MATT: You've just now gotten to that point, you
see the door closing as you get there.

302
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:13,895
SAM: Hello. Hi. How'd it go?

303
00:31:13,895 --> 00:31:18,890
MARISHA: Good work, by the way! That was awesome!
I mean, I saw the fire, I don't know what you did.

304
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,978
LAURA: So it went well?

305
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:27,345
SAM: I set fire to the place, some shit went down,
dinosaurs were harmed, but I know you got the

306
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,623
smoke signal and used that to attack.

307
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:31,527
MARISHA: The de Rolos have dinosaurs?

308
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:35,840
SAM: No, it was me. It's all good, though. I
caused a ruckus, that's all I was supposed to do.

309
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,028
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah.

310
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,478
MATT: "What is going on?"

311
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,577
TRAVIS: Right.

312
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:43,568
TALIESIN: We may have just started a revolution.

313
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,278
MARISHA: Does he look familiar to you?

314
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,949
LIAM: You don't recognize us, it's not safe to
walk these streets for outsiders, so we were using

315
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:58,779
a little bit of trickery. This is us. We're the
same people you were dealing with before.

316
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,360
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

317
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,088
LAURA: We just need to rest.

318
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:07,559
MATT: "Okay. You can rest here, but how long?"

319
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,610
LAURA: Until we're healed, and then we'll go.

320
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,012
LIAM: Overnight.

321
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,148
MATT: "All right."

322
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:16,250
LAURA: I feel like we should get word out to
somebody, though, because--

323
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,649
SAM: To what? To hold the revolution?

324
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:21,477
LAURA: I feel like everybody's going to die before
we even get to the castle!

325
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:24,448
MARISHA: That's the thing. I don't know if this is
the time to rest.

326
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:26,459
LAURA: But we don't have any spells.

327
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:31,627
MARISHA: I'm okay. We can maybe make do.

328
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:34,794
LAURA: I can't make do.

329
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:38,019
TRAVIS: You might be cool, but we're fucked.

330
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,918
TALIESIN: How about we stay here until 4:00, 5:00
in the morning--

331
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,440
MARISHA: What time is it now?

332
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,470
MATT: Right now, I'd say you're close to three in
the afternoon.

333
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:53,469
LAURA: How do we tell the people to like hold
off?

334
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:55,232
SAM: We need to briefly quell the rebellion?

335
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:58,841
MARISHA: We started something. We can't stop it
now.

336
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:05,282
TALIESIN: We're going to be indoors. It doesn't
matter what time we go to attack the castle.

337
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:10,252
SAM: Let's spread word. We can spread word. Let's
find a few--

338
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:13,007
LAURA: Can we send off a message?

339
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:23,632
MARISHA: We sparked a hope in people. We now have
innocent peasants, people who are not fighters--

340
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:28,549
SAM: Can you Skywrite something like "attack
tomorrow" or "hold"?

341
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,052
LAURA: What if we all take off in separate
directions and we tell all the peasants we find

342
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:35,275
that are fighting the time that we're going to
attack?

343
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:39,522
TRAVIS: Aren't there a bunch of zombie stone
giants walking around?

344
00:33:39,522 --> 00:33:43,760
LAURA: Well yeah, we'll have to be sneaky about
it, but we'll spread the rumors around. I look at

345
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,904
Jordana. Joanna?

346
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:47,072
MATT: Jordana.

347
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:53,628
LAURA: Jordana. And I say, can you get word out
to people?

348
00:33:53,628 --> 00:34:01,643
MATT: "To a few, maybe. I don't want to go outside
right now."

349
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,471
LAURA: I don't blame you, dear.

350
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:09,125
TALIESIN: Let's let her stay. I say we just rest
up and we attack tonight.

351
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,712
TRAVIS: Tonight?

352
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:14,474
MARISHA: What if there isn't a town to defend
tonight?

353
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:17,943
TRAVIS: Aren't they stronger then?

354
00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:21,417
TALIESIN: It's going to be indoors, anyway.

355
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:26,043
SAM: First of all, it's raining outside. It's
daytime. There's no vampires out there right now,

356
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,905
right? They don't like water, do they?

357
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:30,752
LAURA: No, they don't like running water, in fact
they hate running water!

358
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,477
I didn't think about that.

359
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:35,504
MARISHA: It's a lot of running water, though. I
think they're all right with rain.

360
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,973
TRAVIS: Yeah, they said a river is what the...
right?

361
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:45,710
SAM: I'm sure they don't like it. In any case, the only
thing that our rebels are rebelling against right

362
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:51,594
now are six zombie giants, one of whom I'm pretty
sure they killed already. Did I see them?

363
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:55,837
MATT: Best you could see, that group was doing
pretty well and was hacking it down. Lost a few of

364
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,193
their number in the process.

365
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,272
MARISHA: Did we ever get a count of how many
zombie giants there were?

366
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:00,245
SAM: There were six.

367
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:03,247
MATT: There were six that you saw while you were
doing your overall flight.

368
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:04,967
LAURA: What, so we go out and fight zombie
giants?

369
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,375
SAM: No, but maybe we could--

370
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:14,140
MARISHA: Why not? We are the most capable people
in this town right now.

371
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,203
LAURA: Well. We could go fight zombie giants and
then tell everybody to wait.

372
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,154
TRAVIS: Nah, it's going to fuck us. We've got to
rest.

373
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:30,546
MARISHA: Why don't we take a short rest, heal up a
bit, get back out there, take down some giants.

374
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,576
What do you guys say?

375
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:36,751
SAM: I admire this fire in your eyes, but it's so
stupid.

376
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:39,585
LAURA: What if we run out and tell people to stop
fucking fighting and wait until tomorrow?

377
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:44,736
LIAM: They won't. The giants are going to keep
smashing them.

378
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:46,889
SAM: What time did he say it was?

379
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:51,416
TALIESIN: It's about three. We could just do a
round of the front courtyard and see what's going on.

380
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,450
LAURA: Fuck! Fine.

381
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,715
TALIESIN: Try and sleep through the night.

382
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:58,143
LAURA: All right. We fight until we absolutely
can't fight anymore.

383
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:01,736
TRAVIS: What about the people who absolutely need a
short rest at the minimum stay.

384
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:02,986
LIAM: We stay for an hour.

385
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,798
TALIESIN: We're short-resting right now.

386
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,125
LIAM: Rest for an hour.

387
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:10,005
MARISHA: This is going to go on for a while, but
the longer we wait indoors, the more people are

388
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:17,981
going to die, and if we're killing people to try
and save the masses-- which is how I'm justifying

389
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:23,276
this whole thing, by the way-- I feel like we
can't leave the masses to their own devices.

390
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:28,786
SAM: Wait a second, what about that, what about
that cleric, the religious man that you've talked

391
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,423
to. Could he get a message out to everybody?
What's his name?

392
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,016
LAURA: At this point, though, it's chaos.

393
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:35,007
TRAVIS: Yeah.

394
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:39,063
MARISHA: We literally lit the fire and we can't
stop it now.

395
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,500
SAM: Archibald? Is that his name?

396
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,979
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're standing up for themselves.

397
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:47,075
TALIESIN: We also, somebody-- there's the point
that somebody is informing on us.

398
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:49,016
MARISHA: Someone <i>is</i> informing on us.

399
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,447
SAM: What are you talking about, why?

400
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:51,956
TALIESIN: They were ready for us. They knew we
were coming.

401
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,447
SAM: Of course they knew we were coming, we killed
one of their--

402
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,825
LAURA: They said there was an informant. They said
that there was an informant when we were there.

403
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:57,738
TRAVIS: Who did?

404
00:36:57,738 --> 00:37:03,112
LAURA: That guard. He said our contacts were
right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is

405
00:37:03,112 --> 00:37:05,931
informing on us. It could be you.

406
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,676
LIAM: I insight-check this woman.

407
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,812
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

408
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:13,152
LIAM: 14.

409
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:16,968
LAURA: Can I say it? Because I just said, "It
could be you." Can I do the same thing?

410
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,927
MATT: Sure, go ahead.

411
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:24,306
LAURA: All right. That's terrible. Okay. So.

412
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:25,750
SAM: What do you want to know?

413
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,385
MATT: Best that you can tell, she just looks
genuinely scared and is uncomfortable with your

414
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:34,589
presence right now but is letting it happen. She's
still getting over the fact that you guys look

415
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,869
entirely different than when you first talked to
her about staying here.

416
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,258
LAURA: Well, short rest and then we head out? We
do some attacks and--

417
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:43,787
LIAM: I've never fought a zombie giant before.

418
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:46,819
LAURA: No, but everybody else is doing it. Those
peasants are doing it.

419
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,827
LIAM: That's what I'm saying. Let's see what we're
up against. Let's take a breather and let's go

420
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:52,083
pick one off.

421
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:58,487
MARISHA: Jordana, do you have any books here on
zombie giants?

422
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:09,088
MATT: "For the most part, necromancy is not
studied in this town. At least, we never had to

423
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:15,447
"deal with it until recently, and we haven't had
the opportunity to really study since."

424
00:38:15,447 --> 00:38:22,074
MARISHA: Well, I mean, zombie combined with
giants. We've fought zombies and we've fought

425
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:25,939
giants, so I'm assuming it with a vague--

426
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:28,080
TRAVIS: What?

427
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,522
LAURA: We keep our distance.

428
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:32,128
TALIESIN: How long does it take to recharge Hex,
by the way?

429
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:34,248
MATT: You need a long rest.

430
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:37,566
TRAVIS: How many Sunbeam hadoukens do you have
left, Keyleth?

431
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:42,109
MARISHA: How many hadoukens? As in Sunbeams? I'm
done on Sunbeams.

432
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:43,944
SAM: We need to rest.

433
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:45,339
TRAVIS: If we get a short rest, how many do you
get?

434
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,552
MARISHA: I'm done. None.

435
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,940
LAURA: We need a long rest to get spells.

436
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,627
MARISHA: However, if I short rest, I actually
haven't burnt any of my animal forms here recently

437
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:59,260
and I can water elemental up, which would also
permanently kill them. So I have other defenses

438
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,472
that could still take down vampires if we
encounter another one. I'm more concerned about

439
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,181
these giants right now.

440
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,990
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about. They're
vampires.

441
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,311
MARISHA: No, they're zombies. They're undead.

442
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:11,293
LAURA: They're zombies.

443
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:12,305
LIAM: They're undead.

444
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:13,860
TRAVIS: Those are two different things, huh?

445
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,327
MATT: They are two very different things.

446
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:16,519
TRAVIS: Grog learns.

447
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,797
(laughter)

448
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:22,613
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

449
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:24,937
LAURA: We short rest and get back out.

450
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:27,665
LIAM: We take a short rest and then exterminate.

451
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:32,436
SAM: Wait, join the rebellion or ride around town
telling everyone, "quell?"

452
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:37,380
MARISHA: We're taking down these damn giants.
These giants are killing people left and right; we

453
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,858
watched them crush people on our way here.

454
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:42,428
TALIESIN: We tell them that they take cover during
the night.

455
00:39:42,428 --> 00:39:44,292
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll four hit dice.

456
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:47,212
MATT: Yeah, you guys go ahead, use your hit dice to
heal up while you're taking your short rest

457
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,710
for those who've taken damage.

458
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,122
LAURA: Oh, Trinket. Can you heal Trinket?

459
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:52,395
MARISHA: I can.

460
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:59,662
LAURA: Heal him so much. Does Trinket get... oh,
he does get hit dice.

461
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:05,729
MATT: Trinket technically does not. Trinket
requires--

462
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:08,071
LAURA: It says he does. It's written down.

463
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:09,031
MATT: Hit dice?

464
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,788
LAURA: Yeah.

465
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:10,728
MATT: Okay.

466
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:17,882
TALIESIN: Also, another strange question: what
creates initiative? Initiative is your dexterity

467
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,870
modifier?

468
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,911
MATT: Correct.

469
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:22,264
TALIESIN: So with me, it's my dexterity modifier.
Plus two.

470
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:23,334
MATT: Correct.

471
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:26,185
TALIESIN: I'm also currently wearing a Headband of
Initiative, which I'd forgotten about.

472
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,250
MATT: Which...?

473
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,025
TALIESIN: Gives me plus two to my initiative.

474
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:29,797
MATT: Correct.

475
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,590
TALIESIN: Oh, dear god almighty. Okay. Thank you.

476
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,741
MATT: Percy, Percy, Percy.

477
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:37,040
TALIESIN: I don't mean to be doing this.

478
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,500
MATT: No, it's great. Just glad you didn't take the
Alertness feat. Then things would have gotten

479
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:43,733
stupid.

480
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,442
LAURA: Are you healing Trinket?

481
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:46,940
MARISHA: How much more does he need?

482
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,621
LAURA: He's at 36. He needs 24 more.

483
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:56,413
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to be using the Hat
of Disguise just because it's probably safe. Does

484
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,838
anybody want a Headband of Initiative?

485
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:02,552
LAURA: Yeah. Do you not need it?

486
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:05,022
TALIESIN: I can't wear two things on my head.

487
00:41:05,022 --> 00:41:07,086
LAURA: I don't have anything on my head.

488
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:10,702
TALIESIN: So you've got plus two to your
initiative, and I'm losing plus two to my

489
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:14,317
initiative. It's called a Headband of Initiative.

490
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:16,050
MARISHA: You already have an eight to your
initiative.

491
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,711
LIAM: It's very mystical.

492
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:22,625
TRAVIS: How much time do we have before the sun
that is being blocked by the rainclouds goes

493
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,512
down?

494
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:28,139
MATT: Well, you guys are taking a short rest,
about 30 minutes to an hour, so you have about two

495
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,080
and a half, three hours before it goes down
entirely.

496
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,861
TALIESIN: That should give us enough time to do a
quick tour. We already know their walking route,

497
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,073
and I'm sure that the people are putting up a
fight.

498
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:38,073
MARISHA: I'm going to give him a level two Cure
Wounds.

499
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:38,953
LAURA: Okay.

500
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:40,707
MARISHA: So do 2d8 plus ten.

501
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,668
LAURA: Me?

502
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,984
MARISHA: Sure. Me or you. Whoever feels more
comfortable.

503
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,482
LAURA: I'll do it. It was good.

504
00:41:46,482 --> 00:41:52,686
MATT: During this rest, if you wanted to
spend some time with that cape--

505
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:58,561
LIAM: I do. I'm going to sniff it and shake it
out.

506
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,591
MATT: For the most part, it doesn't appear to be
enchanted.

507
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:05,107
SAM: No, I can sing a Song of Rest for all of us.

508
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,027
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh, yeah. Do that.

509
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:10,632
SAM: It gives us all 1d6. That's pretty weak.

510
00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:12,873
MARISHA: No, but that's...

511
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:15,442
LAURA: No, it's fine. He's got extra hit points;
don't worry about it.

512
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:21,442
MARISHA: Well, Song of Rest just happens, right?
Do you get that for free? You might as well, if

513
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:22,916
you don't burn anything.

514
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:32,401
SAM: Okay. (sings) Health! We need some now.
Health! Not just anybody. Health! You know you

515
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:33,552
need someone.

516
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,239
ALL: (sings) Health!

517
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:47,522
MATT: That's not trademarked at all. I love it.
All right, so you guys have rested up. Through the

518
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:53,651
rest, you occasionally hear voices run by,
yelling. As you guys get toward the end of your

519
00:42:53,651 --> 00:43:03,799
rest, you hear the (stomping) large heavy
footfalls heading nearby. (groaning, crash) A

520
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:07,577
loud, heavy impact, and you hear some short cheers
outside.

521
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:08,640
TRAVIS: Yes!

522
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,683
LAURA: Yay!

523
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,964
SAM: Oh, he died. That's two down. Splash two.

524
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:17,314
TRAVIS: Right out front, we hear it?

525
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:21,517
MATT: Out front, a little ways off. Not
immediately.

526
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:23,515
SAM: Do we have horses? We don't have any horses,
do we?

527
00:43:23,515 --> 00:43:24,249
LAURA: No.

528
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,142
LIAM: They died.

529
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:26,972
MATT: Yeah, they got eaten by harpies.

530
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:28,841
TRAVIS: Should we go outside and see how they're
doing?

531
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:30,466
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's check it out.

532
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:31,904
TRAVIS: We go out front.

533
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,812
LIAM: Time to kill some giant undead.

534
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,599
MATT: Okay. Jordana lets you guys out, locks
behind her.

535
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,793
MARISHA: Do we want to split up?

536
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:38,242
TALIESIN: No, let's keep together.

537
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,045
LAURA: Actually, before we go, I ask, do you have
any holy symbols at all in here?

538
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,574
MATT: "I'm sorry, no."

539
00:43:42,574 --> 00:43:43,723
LAURA: Nothing?

540
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:49,264
MATT: "No. All those were kept in either of the
two temples here."

541
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:51,743
LAURA: Do you have anything magic that could help
me?

542
00:43:51,743 --> 00:43:53,574
MATT: "I already gave you everything of magic that
I had here."

543
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:55,474
LAURA: Oh, right. I forgot we took it.

544
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:56,550
MATT: "Sorry."

545
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,177
LAURA: Shit. All right, thank you.

546
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:00,071
TRAVIS: Once we're outside, how far away is that
giant that was felled?

547
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:04,999
MATT: As you step outside and look, it's about 60
feet off, near one of the big crossroads near this

548
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:09,887
area. And a zombie giant has been completely
felled down, and there are three people now that

549
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:13,855
are currently in the process of hacking its head
off just to make sure. It's a group of about seven

550
00:44:13,855 --> 00:44:18,253
people that live here. They're all looking pretty
messed up, but they're all eager and

551
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:24,347
adrenaline-driven, they're all hacking away, then
stopping and taking a breath (breathes heavily).

552
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:28,746
You hear in the distance, (thunder crack) bolt of
lightning coming down from the storm, and as it

553
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:35,222
echoes, everyone shakes for a second, look at each
other, (cheers) give a cheer of victory. They all

554
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:40,725
hop off the body of the zombie giant and begin
darting further in towards the center of the city.

555
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,935
MARISHA: I look up. Is my de Rolo symbol still in
the sky?

556
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:48,244
MATT: It's there. It's dissipating slowly, but
it's still there. It's moved a little bit off-axis

557
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:49,786
with the storm.

558
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:54,334
TRAVIS: So that's it for the big houses, right?
Just the castle.

559
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:55,444
TALIESIN: Just the castle.

560
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:59,554
SAM: Except we haven't killed the members of one
of the houses. By the way, my Song of Rest is a d8.

561
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:00,725
LAURA: Awesome.

562
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:05,847
SAM: But we haven't killed the last one. Now, the
one that you guys killed. What's his name again,

563
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:06,714
Tylieri?

564
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:07,605
MATT: Tylieri.

565
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:08,766
SAM: He was a vampire.

566
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:09,806
ALL: Yes.

567
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:15,905
SAM: Because Sylas killed him. Right?

568
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:17,077
TALIESIN: Yes.

569
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:19,415
SAM: And then made him a vampire.

570
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:20,524
TALIESIN: One would assume.

571
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:22,715
SAM: Didn't he hang him on the Sun Tree?

572
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:25,732
LAURA: What? No. What? What are you talking
about?

573
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:28,287
SAM: I don't know. Didn't that guy that we
meet...

574
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:36,155
MATT: You do recall, actually, when you were
interrogating the driver of the Briarwoods.

575
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:46,267
Tylieri was the master of the driver Desmond, who
beat him and subjugated him to various forms of

576
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:53,941
torture and abuse before Lord Briarwood took
Desmond and, to try and show extension of faith,

577
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:58,468
revealed to Desmond Tylieri hanging from the Sun
Tree. That was true.

578
00:45:58,468 --> 00:45:59,987
TRAVIS: Wow.

579
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:04,369
SAM: And then he became a vampire. Is that where
they're spawning?

580
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,417
LAURA: No. Maybe he was already a vampire and he
hung him from the tree just to show--

581
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:13,438
SAM: That doesn't seem right.

582
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,580
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Sun Tree, why don't
we?

583
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,947
LAURA: Let's head that direction.

584
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:20,286
TRAVIS: Let's go.

585
00:46:20,286 --> 00:46:25,396
MARISHA: Something to us about how when people die
in this town. The guy you talked to at the bar?

586
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:29,341
SAM: Yes, we talked to a guy at the bar. What
about him?

587
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:32,829
MARISHA: He said when people die here they don't
die.

588
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,648
SAM: Well, yes, we know that, yes.

589
00:46:34,648 --> 00:46:35,881
LAURA: They come back.

590
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:38,995
LIAM: They could be-- yes, that could apply, too.

591
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:44,087
MARISHA: I think this whole damn town-- I think
the whole land is cursed. Is what I think.

592
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:45,281
TRAVIS: I think that's--

593
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:46,687
LAURA: Probably pretty fair.

594
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:48,517
TRAVIS: Should we go to the tree?

595
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:49,517
LAURA: Sure.

596
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,022
MARISHA: Why?

597
00:46:51,022 --> 00:46:53,751
TALIESIN: Just to see--

598
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:56,748
LAURA: We'll make our way through the town and
look for giants as we make our way to the tree.

599
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:58,919
MARISHA: Let's look for giants. Let's go
giant-hunting.

600
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:04,355
MATT: Okay. All right, so from the Alcove, you guys
head in a southwestern motion, keeping off the

601
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:11,711
main paths best you can. The main chaos seems to
have died down a little bit in this area of the

602
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:19,193
town. You come across another body of a zombie
giant, surrounded by what looks like eight bodies

603
00:47:19,193 --> 00:47:21,352
of civilians of the town.

604
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:23,208
LAURA: Are they all dead, or are they injured?

605
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:28,259
MATT: No, they are all very dead. Two of which are
torn in half and just tossed to different sides,

606
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:34,881
one appears to be half-eaten, and the rest are
just smashed. But whatever troop was with

607
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:38,661
them managed to take the zombie giant down.
Eventually, you make your way to the center of the

608
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:46,781
town square where the Sun Tree is and there is,
across the way on the opposite side, what appears

609
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:54,526
to be, in mid-struggle, one zombie giant that has
a series of spears or javelins sticking out of its

610
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:59,067
torso. It's currently swatting at a group of
individuals that have torches in the rain, still

611
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:04,249
trying to get up towards it and push it backward.
The Sun Tree, at a glance-- roll a perception

612
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:05,650
check.

613
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,506
MARISHA: All of us?

614
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:07,929
MATT: Yes.

615
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:12,480
TALIESIN: One. There's a tree!

616
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,829
SAM: Four.

617
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,319
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, so 29?

618
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:16,350
MATT: Okay.

619
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,310
LIAM: 23.

620
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,139
LAURA: If my passive perception's higher than my
roll--

621
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:22,765
MATT: Active perception and passive perception--
passive is more something to keep track when

622
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:26,517
you're not actively perceiving. So. Grog?

623
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,674
TRAVIS: Seven.

624
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:33,225
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you pick this out in the
rain, and it's hard to see, but from this angle,

625
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:41,881
you see what looks to be eight ropes, currently,
just dangling free from the Sun Tree.

626
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,390
TALIESIN: Damn it.

627
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,590
LAURA: Shit.

628
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,425
SAM: The tree is the spawning spot.

629
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,120
LAURA: Really?

630
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,330
SAM: Or maybe one of them.

631
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,400
TRAVIS: Or maybe they cut them down.

632
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,196
SAM: We've got to cut down this tree.

633
00:48:55,196 --> 00:48:58,201
LAURA: Does it look like the ropes have been cut?

634
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,111
MATT: You can go closer to inspect it if you
want.

635
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,190
MARISHA: Yeah.

636
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,600
MATT: You're hearing in the distance the (roars)
the battle's still raging about 65, 70 feet from

637
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,837
you. You get up behind the tree and you take the
ropes and inspect it. All the ropes are very

638
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:11,909
finely cut.

639
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:14,291
LAURA: Oh. They were cut. They cut them down.

640
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:15,998
TRAVIS: They cut their dead down.

641
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,839
MARISHA: Okay, so the nooses are gone.

642
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:24,038
MATT: Yeah. And you do see, there are a number.
This close, you can see there are loops of rope

643
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:29,337
all over the tree: some very old and weathered and
aged, some of them are torn, some of them are cut,

644
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:34,991
but the fresh ones that are the longest currently
and that are placed closest to where the bodies

645
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,430
were originally there are all very cleanly cut.

646
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,402
LAURA: Can we spin around and look and see if
there's anything around that looks like-- or look

647
00:49:41,402 --> 00:49:45,371
at tracking and see if it looks like somebody cut
them down or if they fell on their own?

648
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:52,455
MATT: You glance around real fast and you can see
to the south there is still the battle raging

649
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:55,965
between the zombie giant and the crew of
individuals, but you look back where you guys were

650
00:49:55,965 --> 00:50:01,813
from, and you see a large series of shapes
stepping through the rain, coming from the

651
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:03,281
direction you guys were.

652
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:07,132
LIAM: I think they cut them down just like
Tylieri. I think that this is where they hang them

653
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:11,132
to ripen, and then when they're ready they pluck
them off the tree and set them on their way.

654
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:16,193
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you,
keeping your eyes forward as he's saying this in

655
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:23,182
your ear, you can see, as the light of the town is
slowly beginning to vanish into a sunset--

656
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:24,584
MARISHA: Is it still raining?

657
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:31,852
MATT: It is still raining. You see ahead of you,
coming from the central roadway into the square of

658
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:40,585
the town, what you can only surmise to be anywhere
from 30 to 50 armored skeletal entities that are

659
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:42,783
pouring from the north.

660
00:50:42,783 --> 00:50:44,644
MARISHA: Okay. I climb the Sun Tree.

661
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:46,343
SAM: Wait, what? We've got to get out of here!

662
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:47,626
MARISHA: I'm climbing the Sun Tree.

663
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:51,103
MATT: Climbing the Sun Tree. All right. You guys
see Keyleth scurry up the Sun Tree.

664
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:56,808
SAM: I blow my Horn of Fog to create a
smokescreen. I don't know what the fuck she's

665
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:57,873
doing.

666
00:50:57,873 --> 00:51:03,153
MATT: Okay. (foghorn sound) The slow horn-blow
comes out, and this fog begins to fill the area

667
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:08,845
between this marching skeletal army and the Sun
Tree where you guys currently are. Looking over

668
00:51:08,845 --> 00:51:13,324
your shoulder, you can see the zombie giant
finishes smashing the last individual in that

669
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:18,074
crew, picks it up and jams it into its jagged
giant teeth.

670
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,644
MARISHA: So there's a big army coming down,
filtering down a street.

671
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:21,991
MATT: Down the street towards you.

672
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,022
MARISHA: How far away?

673
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:24,999
MATT: You can't tell now. There's just fog along
the way.

674
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,613
MARISHA: I can't tell how far away they are right
now?

675
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:27,714
MATT: No, you can't see them.

676
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:29,253
MARISHA: I can't see them?

677
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,588
MATT: No, because Scanlan just created a whole
bunch of fog between the two of you. The moment

678
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:37,755
you saw, they may be about a hundred or so feet
from you.

679
00:51:37,755 --> 00:51:41,215
LIAM: Keyleth, tell us what you're thinking,
because the rest of us are taking this time to go.

680
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:44,846
TRAVIS: You engage, they'll follow, we go, we
fight another day, we sleep in the rafters and

681
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:46,486
wait until daybreak.

682
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:48,103
LIAM: Who are you?

683
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:53,391
MARISHA: I might be able to do something.

684
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,474
LAURA: What is it? Say it!

685
00:51:55,474 --> 00:52:01,962
MARISHA: I can do a big ice storm or do something
to take all these fuckers out at once.

686
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:04,714
TRAVIS: All 30 to 50 of them? Kill them all?

687
00:52:04,714 --> 00:52:06,330
MARISHA: It's a big range.

688
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,645
LIAM: No. Keyleth, we've got to go.

689
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:15,015
TALIESIN: I say we let her hit them, and we run.

690
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:20,145
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you drop the fog just a
bit?

691
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,727
SAM: Nope, not by magic.

692
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:22,975
MATT: He can't control it.

693
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:27,115
LAURA: It's on the ground. You can probably see
above it. Fog is low.

694
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:32,755
MATT: Well, the fog this creates is a magical fog
that obscures an entire area. If you climbed to

695
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:35,695
the very top of the tree, you might be able to get
a little bit of a visual.

696
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,664
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to climb as high as
I can.

697
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,525
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

698
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,111
LAURA: I'm going to climb up after her.

699
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,529
SAM: Oh my god.

700
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:49,947
MARISHA: 11. Acrobatics or athletics?

701
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:51,023
MATT: Athletics.

702
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:53,329
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 15.

703
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:59,948
MATT: 15. Okay. You make your way up to the very
precarious top of the branches. You can feel the

704
00:52:59,948 --> 00:53:04,565
brittleness of it as the tree itself, its life
force is withered over time and some of it cracks

705
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:10,754
and some of the actual bark of the tree twists off
in your grip as you get to the very top. You can look

706
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:15,893
just over the bank of fog that Scanlan has created
and you can see beyond that. The number of undead

707
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:20,933
from this angle, what was initially like 30
probably pushes closer to about a hundred.

708
00:53:20,933 --> 00:53:24,957
MARISHA: Okay. And they're like a hundred feet
away?

709
00:53:24,957 --> 00:53:27,615
MATT: Starting about a hundred feet away, slowly
marching towards you.

710
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:33,597
MARISHA: Right where they are, I'm going to start
a little ahead of where they originate, I'm going

711
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:39,878
to start making an ice storm. I'm pushing all the
way back to where-- just right down these

712
00:53:39,878 --> 00:53:40,717
fuckers.

713
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,616
LIAM: I'm also just trying to stay underneath her
as best I can.

714
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:46,564
LAURA: Stop looking up her skirt, brother.

715
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:48,397
LIAM: Is she in a skirt?

716
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:50,738
SAM: She's been wearing a dress this whole time?

717
00:53:50,738 --> 00:53:52,376
LIAM: I thought she was covered in leaves.

718
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,114
TALIESIN: Stop looking up her fig leaf.

719
00:53:55,114 --> 00:54:00,547
MATT: All right. What's the damage on that? Is it
2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8--

720
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:04,138
MARISHA: They take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6
cold damage.

721
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:09,147
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for both. And it's a
save for half, right?

722
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:10,639
TALIESIN: Inspiration?

723
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,008
SAM: Oh. Well. I didn't do it.

724
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:28,408
MARISHA: 2d8 bludgeoning, that's seven
bludgeoning... 4d6. Not great at all. Four, five,

725
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:29,908
six, seven, eight.

726
00:54:29,908 --> 00:54:34,186
MATT: Total of eight. Eight plus... what was the
other one?

727
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:35,418
MARISHA: Seven.

728
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:37,030
MATT: Seven, okay.

729
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,828
MARISHA: And it's difficult terrain.

730
00:54:38,828 --> 00:54:46,364
MATT: Okay. So the first area. Suddenly you see
some of the clouds above you begin to funnel

731
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:52,791
downward, and a few bolts of electricity (crackle)
through it. As the funnel hits, it grows dark, and

732
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:58,888
then all of a sudden this cold wind begins to
swirl around it. And with that, the cloud almost

733
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:04,790
seems to tear open within itself and a sheet of
jagged ice and sleet begins to pour downward into

734
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:12,179
the center of this undead horde. As it does, you
can see probably a good 25, 30 of these are just

735
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:19,319
blown apart, bone shards scattered around and you
can see bits of rusted metal weapons and armor

736
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:25,259
thrown left and right. The ice then coalesces over
the floor of this area and some of the skeletons

737
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:31,540
just slip, but they keep marching forward. It
definitely took a chunk, but as it continues

738
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,971
pushing forward--

739
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:36,949
MARISHA: Now we can run.

740
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:41,140
LAURA: Good job. I grab the back of her 
shirt and yank her towards me.

741
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:47,263
MATT: You guys make your way down the tree.
As you get to the bottom of the tree, the zombie

742
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:55,578
giant has taken notice of the sudden flashing of
light and the movement in the tree and is bounding

743
00:55:55,578 --> 00:55:57,688
towards the tree after you guys.

744
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,633
LAURA: Are we running?

745
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:01,872
TRAVIS: Are we going to the Alcove or going to the
treeline?

746
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:05,240
TALIESIN: I say we go to the treeline, and I say
that you take a couple shots as we're heading--

747
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:10,455
LAURA: I'm definitely doing that, yes. I'm going
to shoot at the giant as we're running. Hunter's

748
00:56:10,455 --> 00:56:11,442
Mark him.

749
00:56:11,442 --> 00:56:13,512
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark, turning around,
looking at the giant.

750
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:17,565
MARISHA: As she says that, I'm going to go ahead
and start casting my Call Lightning spell.

751
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:22,649
MATT: Okay. So you land and you cast Call
Lightning. The fog that you created, Scanlan?

752
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:23,652
SAM: Yes.

753
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:28,794
MATT: Has formed up. You start seeing shapes;
these terrifying skeletal faces begin to appear

754
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:35,641
through the fog as the rest of the army begins to
push through. The clouds coalescing above Keyleth

755
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:39,611
as you get your Call Lightning ready, you marking
the zombie giant, you guys begin bolting out of

756
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:43,841
the way. Trinket comes running up behind you, Vex,
and picks you up onto his back, and you guys begin

757
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:46,272
rushing off toward the treeline-- to the west or
the east?

758
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:47,560
LAURA: Can I shoot him?

759
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,812
MARISHA: Yeah, as I turn around, I Call Lightning
on the giant.

760
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:52,604
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

761
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:56,113
MARISHA: And it's cloudy, so I get how much more?

762
00:56:56,113 --> 00:57:00,287
MATT: I don't know, how much do you get more on
that? Call Lightning would be...

763
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:03,201
SAM: While you decide, which way are we going,
Percy? West or east?

764
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:08,022
MATT: 3d10. It does an additional d10. It does
4d10.

765
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:12,502
LAURA: And I'm going to shoot him through my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel as we're going away, too.

766
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:13,963
MATT: Okay.

767
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:21,742
TALIESIN: So the passage to the castle I'm aware
of is to the west, and then the one that Stonefell

768
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,512
mentioned is to the east?

769
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:25,984
TRAVIS: Do we go to the treeline by the castle?

770
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,463
MATT: No, the one Stonefell mentioned was the
same.

771
00:57:27,463 --> 00:57:28,313
TALIESIN: Was the same?

772
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:30,082
MATT: It wasn't Stonefell, it was Vouk.

773
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:31,283
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you.

774
00:57:31,283 --> 00:57:33,022
MATT: But yeah. He was referring to the same one.

775
00:57:33,022 --> 00:57:34,913
TALIESIN: Treeline to the west so that we can
attack first thing.

776
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,262
LAURA: 22. Twice.

777
00:57:37,262 --> 00:57:38,462
MATT: 22 hits.

778
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:40,062
LAURA: And then three on the last one.

779
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:41,202
MATT: Okay, yeah.

780
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:43,402
LAURA: Well, it's technically 14 on the last one.

781
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:46,324
MATT: For him? Still hits.

782
00:57:46,324 --> 00:57:47,323
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

783
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:50,362
MATT: It's a big target. Big target, lot of hit
points.

784
00:57:50,362 --> 00:57:55,472
MARISHA: And as she's brewing up her bow, I'm
behind her and just bring down the bolt for 32

785
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,510
damage.

786
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:00,474
MATT: Damn. (lightning sound) You can see the bolt
strikes the front of the zombie giant right as it

787
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:05,892
starts swinging after you guys. The bolt hits its
shoulder and blasts a chunk of its shoulder blade

788
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:10,773
off. You see bone shards fire behind, and there's
a giant piece of its torso now missing where the

789
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:15,212
bolt hit. (groans) Stumbles back onto its back
foot and catches itself, almost toppling over.

790
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:17,733
MARISHA: Just start backing up. "Vex?"

791
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:22,184
MATT: It starts lumbering forward again as Vex
releases her arrow, which splits into three.

792
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,476
MARISHA: Vex?

793
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:25,823
LAURA: 54 points of damage.

794
00:58:25,823 --> 00:58:26,775
MARISHA: Kill it!

795
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:35,050
MATT: Nice! (impact sounds) All the arrows
blasting into its body, you can see they sink in

796
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,235
and burst on the inside. There's a little, a dull
glow as this burst of electrical energy hits from

797
00:58:40,235 --> 00:58:45,944
underneath its sickly zombified flesh. At which
point, there's a slight delay before it (explosion

798
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:50,733
sound) bubbles forth and a bit of its internal
liquid just spews out like a boil. You can see

799
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:57,260
it's definitely taking damage, and it keeps
pushing forward. Yeah, it's still moving towards

800
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,284
you guys.

801
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,565
LIAM: How far away is it?

802
00:58:59,565 --> 00:59:00,796
TALIESIN: For gods' sakes!

803
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:02,758
MATT: It's about ten feet from you guys right
now.

804
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:10,764
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News. I'm shooting it
with Bad News, and I'm going for an aimed shot to

805
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,405
the legs.

806
00:59:12,405 --> 00:59:18,204
MATT: Okay. The moment it would take for you to
stop and pull out Bad News, by the way, the moment

807
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:21,534
you guys are turning around to attack it, it has
gotten within range to hit, so this is all

808
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:25,815
happening simultaneously, so it's going to get two
strikes as you guys get your attacks, as well.

809
00:59:25,815 --> 00:59:27,226
MARISHA: What are you doing?

810
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:29,013
MATT: So. Go ahead and roll your attack.

811
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:29,874
LIAM: I did.

812
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:30,705
MATT: What did you get?

813
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:31,524
LIAM: 27 and an 18.

814
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:32,535
MATT: Both hit.

815
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,775
TALIESIN: I got 28.

816
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:41,674
MATT: Okay. And against Percy, that is a 17 and a
20.

817
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:44,234
TALIESIN: 17 misses. The 20 hits.

818
00:59:44,234 --> 00:59:55,573
MATT: Okay. You take 16 points of bludgeoning
damage as its fist comes down and (whack) slams

819
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:00,205
into your side just as Bad News fires off and your
daggers go (dagger sounds) towards it.

820
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:02,522
LIAM: Keen Dagger, Flametongue, combined 20 hit
points.

821
01:00:02,594 --> 01:00:05,121
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

822
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:09,711
MARISHA: And as soon as I'm able, I'm backing up
and bringing down another lightning bolt.

823
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:11,894
LAURA: Well, I've got another attack. That was
just one attack that I did.

824
01:00:11,894 --> 01:00:13,750
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

825
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,591
SAM: You need your spells. We need to hide. We
need to run.

826
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:21,871
MARISHA: It's okay, this is a concentration spell.
I can keep doing it. I'm not blowing spells on it.

827
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:25,490
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage, plus he's knocked
prone.

828
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,120
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. Through the daggers--

829
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,054
TALIESIN: Oh, he can make a con saving throw,
though.

830
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:36,252
MATT: It doesn't matter. It still manages to keep
its zombie form, though it seems like every single

831
01:00:36,252 --> 01:00:40,301
hit you're taking chunks off its body, but it
continues to push through the damage until

832
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:45,170
eventually it swings at you with the hit, Bad News
goes off as it blasts through the center of its

833
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:49,440
torso and takes out the back of its spine. It
can't keep its physical form together, and as its

834
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,351
body lunges forward, you throw both of your
daggers, which go (thoonk thoonk) into each of its

835
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:59,032
eyes. It falls forward. The torso seems to roll on
impact and come after you like a slow-moving

836
01:00:59,032 --> 01:01:03,133
boulder for a few feet, but since you're all
moving forward, you manage to outrun it, just

837
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:07,096
barely keeping out of the way. The legs
walk on their own for two more steps before it

838
01:01:07,193 --> 01:01:14,255
just falls forward into the mud, relieving all its
intestines into the rain-soaked ground.

839
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:15,777
SAM: Let's get out of here!

840
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:16,981
MARISHA: Go, go, go. Run!

841
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:18,482
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace!

842
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:20,112
TRAVIS: Aggressive flower girl.

843
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:23,372
MARISHA: Do I see any other-- as we're running
through--

844
01:01:23,372 --> 01:01:24,755
LAURA: Just run, Keyleth!

845
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:26,814
LIAM: I grab Keyleth by the arm and I just pull
and run.

846
01:01:26,814 --> 01:01:29,752
MATT: You guys go running back and as you're
looking over your shoulder you can see the

847
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:36,302
skeletal army swarming the center of the square
and pouring into the streets. It seems that the

848
01:01:36,302 --> 01:01:42,472
Briarwoods had their own reserve anti-riot
campaign at the ready.

849
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:44,643
LAURA: Oh, are they going to take out everybody?

850
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:46,232
MARISHA: We can't go, we can't go!

851
01:01:46,232 --> 01:01:49,168
SAM: We have to go. We have nothing left.

852
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:51,650
MATT: And with that, we're going to conclude
tonight's session.

853
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,313
(groaning)

854
01:01:53,313 --> 01:01:58,132
MATT: We'll be returning next week on that note.

855
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:02,723
TRAVIS: (laughs) You son of a bitch, I love it.

856
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:08,531
MATT: All right, so we're going to take a little break
here while we set up for Critmas. Quick one, very

857
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:13,101
quick, we'll be back here in just a few minutes,
for those who want to hang in and watch how

858
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:15,152
ridiculously amazing this community is.
