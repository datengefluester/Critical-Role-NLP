00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,215
MATT: (laughing) Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical--

2
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,666
fuck you, Liam! Fuck you!

3
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:41,511
Tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch 
of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:43,508
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.

5
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,969
LIAM: Victory!

6
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:47,508
LAURA: You did it.

7
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:50,879
MATT: Oh, that's gonna come back to haunt you.
Welcome to tonight's episode.

8
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,675
We have quite an episode tonight. We'll have that
to get to in just a moment.

9
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,694
First, we'll get through our announcements for the
evening.

10
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:01,827
First and foremost, our wonderful sponsor tonight,
returning to sponsor the show, Lootcrate!

11
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,562
ALL: Lootcrate!

12
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:08,530
MATT: To open that up, Sam, who could not be here
tonight unfortunately,

13
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,745
Sam Riegel is not able to make the episode.

14
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:14,571
He did make a video, however, to help get us in
the spirit of Lootcrate's awesomeness.

15
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,568
LAURA: Oh, wow.

16
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:20,059
MATT: If you want to go ahead and show that for
us.

17
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:25,323
SAM: Hi everyone, it's me, pro alpine skier Sam
Riegel, a.k.a. Scanlan Shorthalt

18
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:30,390
from Critical Role. You know, when I'm not 
rolling dice, I'm rolling the dice on the hot,

19
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,661
hot slopes of Park City, Utah.

20
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:33,995
(worried noise)

21
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:38,580
Anyway. I just did a lot of downhill skiing 
today, and it was pretty cool,

22
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,170
but not as cool as the stuff you can get
inside Lootcrate. Sign up now and you'll save so

23
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:51,994
much money, you can come on an exciting vacation
to Park City, Utah, buy skis, and gloves, and go

24
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:59,248
skiing. With me! Sam Riegel, a.k.a Scanlan
Shorthalt from TV's-- well. The internet's

25
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:07,182
Critical Role! Anyway, I'm about to go do my last
run. Hope I don't break my leg. (worried noise)

26
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:13,619
If I do, I won't see you on Thursday, but if 
I don't, let's roll high. Bye-bye.

27
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:18,109
MATT: Thank you very much, Sam. We look forward to
having you back next week in one form or another.

28
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,934
ALL: Ohhh.

29
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,149
LAURA: Mercer!

30
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,617
MATT: What? What?

31
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:24,607
LAURA: Oh no!

32
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,776
ASHLEY: That's cold!

33
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:26,813
LAURA: Ice-cold.

34
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:27,557
TALIESIN: That's not nice.

35
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,503
MATT: But to finish up the details of our
wonderful Lootcrate sponsorship, we have Ashley

36
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:31,823
Johnson joining us thankfully from New York.

37
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,520
ALL: (cheering)

38
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,860
MATT: The monster herself.

39
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,635
ASHLEY: Tonight's episode of Critical Role is

43
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,197
TRAVIS: Oh man, I mean, just--

44
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:18,526
ASHLEY: Critical Role!

45
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,965
ALL: (applauding)

46
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,013
MATT: Thank you, Ashley.

47
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,052
LAURA: Good job, Ashley.

48
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,267
MARISHA: That was so good. That was--

49
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,638
LIAM: You have to get a plane back to New York
now, right?

50
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:28,651
ASHLEY: Okay, bye!

51
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,076
MATT: All right, so, next up we have merch
announcements. Laura, do you want to go ahead?

52
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:39,571
LAURA: Oh gosh, yeah! Okay, you guys. I know we've
been teasing it for a while, but guess what we

53
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,186
have back in stock?

54
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,275
MARISHA: Are those the Critical Role dice sets?

55
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:45,712
LAURA: Why, they are!

56
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,412
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!

57
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,985
LAURA: Don't get too excited right now, 'cause
they're not in the store at this very moment,

58
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:55,904
okay? We're putting them up for sale tomorrow at
noon our time, Pacific Standard Time, so that, you

59
00:14:55,904 --> 00:15:00,366
know, all you lovely folks that don't get to watch
at 7PM on Thursdays can maybe snag 'em tomorrow

60
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:05,737
afternoon, too. So, 12PM. Go to the store
tomorrow. That's Friday, and you will get one of

61
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,156
these cool things.

62
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,765
MATT: Yay!

63
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,589
TRAVIS: They've all been anointed with our
individual musks.

64
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,099
LAURA: That's right. We've licked very bag.

65
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,061
MARISHA: It's true.

66
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,590
ASHLEY: Every dice. Every die.

67
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,503
TRAVIS: Yeah, DNA all over.

68
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:15,459
LAURA: I literally just licked it.

69
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,611
MARISHA: I put a bunch in my bra, walked around
for a day.

70
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,373
TALIESIN: Swished it right to left. Right to left.

71
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,482
LAURA: Nice, nice.

72
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,388
ASHLEY: Armpits.

73
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:20,013
LAURA: Armpits. Lots of armpits.

74
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:20,731
MARISHA: Boob sweat.

75
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:21,827
TALIESIN: Yeah. Wet.

76
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:27,032
MATT: So, you get to enjoy that. Thank you, Laura.
Also a reminder, we have Anime Milwaukee coming

77
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:31,152
up, February 17th through the 19th. We have me and
Marisha and Laura and Travis will be in attendance

78
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,266
with some cool folks.

79
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,236
(all cheer)

80
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,447
MATT: So come check us out. I think that's it.

81
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:35,917
LAURA: Noon.

82
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,336
MATT: Anyone else have anything they wanna talk
about?

83
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,416
TRAVIS: Nope.

84
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,592
TALIESIN: Uh, yeah, no. (laughs)

85
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:45,342
MATT: All right, then. Then, let's bring it down
just a little bit--

86
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:46,303
LIAM: What do you mean?

87
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,888
MATT: --as we step into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

88
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:52,580
(nervous sounds)

89
00:15:52,580 --> 00:17:19,847
(opening credits)

90
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:26,011
MATT: And welcome back. So, to get you caught up
on the current events of Critical Role. The party,

91
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:32,135
Vox Machina, has been combating the horrible,
terrible influence of the Chroma Conclave, a group

92
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,643
of chromatic dragons that have been terrorizing
the countryside of Tal'Dorei, occupying the city

93
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:42,256
of Emon, Westruun, and places beyond. They've
managed to kill off all the members of the

94
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:48,289
Conclave, leading up to Raishan, the orchestrator
behind the scenes of most of the chaos that

95
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:54,112
they've seen in recent months. Raishan managed to
nearly destroy Vox Machina before absconding with

96
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:59,730
the corpse of Thordak, apparently into the next
portion of her plot. The party, upon running into

97
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:06,882
an old friend, Kerrek from Westruun, who had
helped in the attack on Emon, joined forces to

98
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:11,897
give chase, in hopes through your decision to head
her off at the pass and prevent Raishan from

99
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:18,533
seeing to fruition whatever plan she had after
this leg. Through a series of very well-placed

100
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:24,500
scrys, you discovered that she had absconded to
the island of Viscond, an old lair of Thordak's

101
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,496
and before that, an older lair of Opash, an
ancient necromancer who was banished and made that

102
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:36,529
his lair. As you made your way to the island,
hopefully prepared for this, you've fought through

103
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:41,901
various traps and difficult challenges throughout
the necromancer's sanctum, eventually coming into

104
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:49,820
battle with Raishan herself. A long hard-fought
battle left Percy and Scanlan both lifeless to the

105
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,835
ground. Percy was risen quickly. Scanlan,
unfortunately, was not. And the final blow

106
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:00,860
delivered a combination of both Keyleth tearing
the intellect from Raishan through a well-placed

107
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,080
Feeblemind spell and Kerrek with a well-placed
warhammer blow to the head of the green dragon.

108
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,740
MARISHA: High five.

109
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,489
MATT: (laughs) High five from the screen.

110
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,011
TRAVIS: You're just hitting him in the face.

111
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:14,017
TALISIN: So awkward.

112
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:14,821
MARISHA: Deuces.

113
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,828
MATT: There you go.

114
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:17,225
TRAVIS: (laughs) Deuces.

115
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:23,899
MATT: The dragon destroyed. However, their friend,
Scanlan, still lifeless and still, growing colder

116
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,856
as the minutes passed. Picked up his body and you
fled the cavern to the outside of the island after

117
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:34,310
discovering the teleportation or, at least, the
magic of transport had some sort of an alteration

118
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:43,499
or a funkiness to it, if you will. You watched as
two of your allies, Kima and Allura, were, instead

119
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,289
of teleporting away through a circle, sent deep
out into the ocean. You managed to find them

120
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,006
(laughs) through a very lucky perception roll.

121
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,030
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

122
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,805
MATT: And at least was able-- you were able to
connect your Transport via Plants through one of

123
00:19:54,805 --> 00:20:02,629
the outside trees by the beach to get you all to
Whitestone. There you took Scanlan's body to the

124
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:12,367
recently constructed temple to the Raven Queen
and in preparing for this ritual the Gatestone was

125
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:20,965
taken by Vex, who with the help of the Realmseer
Eskil Ryndarien, transported to Kymal, made your

126
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:27,000
way through the riff-raff to one of the darkened
taverns there, to find Kaylie, Scanlan's daughter,

127
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,713
long-estranged and rambunctious daughter but
daughter nonetheless. Handed her the Gatestone and

128
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:41,224
she vanished in a puff of arcane smoke, leaving
you and-- Eskil more confused than you, within the

129
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:45,891
tavern. And that... is where we jump back in for
the evening.

130
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,568
TRAVIS: (gagging noise)

131
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:55,064
MATT: So, as you guys are waiting carefully,
figuring out what to do in these moments. Pike, as

132
00:20:55,064 --> 00:21:01,306
you're cleaning the area, cleaning the body and
doing the best you can to begin preparing for a

133
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:08,008
ritual that you are hoping will be in the favor of
you and your friends. Percy, as you hold the other

134
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:13,234
end of the Gatestone, you feel it begin to glow
and warm in your hand and you instinctively take a

135
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:20,626
step back as within a bright flash (fizzle sound)
you watch as Kaylie, the gnomish, short-haired,

136
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:25,622
rambunctious bard stands there now, near the
entranceway to the Raven Queen's temple holding

137
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:30,087
the other Gatestone. She's clutching it, her face
still stoic and confused by the sudden

138
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:34,199
transference. She takes it and drops it to the
ground.

139
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,946
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

140
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,589
MARISHA: She found you.

141
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:47,991
MATT: Right. Good to see all of you. 
So... Is it true?

142
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:54,315
TALIESIN: Yes (clears throat) He's inside.

143
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:58,305
MATT: "Let me see the bastard." 
And she pushes past and muscles through you

144
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:03,744
who've just previously begun to walk into the
temple slowly kind of taking in the gravity of the

145
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:11,384
situation and whether or not you want to even step
up the plate on this, in that quiet, tense, slow

146
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:16,726
but perpetual thought process that is Grog. You
feel a small hand grab the side of your hip and

147
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:21,631
shove, though to no effect, you just feel a little
tug as Kaylie pushes past you.

148
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,363
"Pardon me big man"

149
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:29,125
And you watch as she darts up to where Pike is
currently preparing the body for the ritual.

150
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,897
ASHLEY: (quick sigh)

151
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:39,349
MATT: You watch as Kaylie steps up to the edge and
gets up onto the top of the central altar and

152
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:53,649
stands over quietly looking down over Scanlan's
cold body. She crosses her arms.

153
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:57,148
"He made me a promise."

154
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:59,583
ASHLEY: I know

155
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:07,687
MATT: "You made me a promise!"

156
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:14,914
And she leans forward, kneels down and slaps him
across the face (cracking sound)

157
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:17,189
"You made me a promise."

158
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:22,268
And she gets up and (sniffle) wipes her nose a bit
and hops off and just storms

159
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,646
ASHLEY: I run after her.

160
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:27,143
MATT: Okay, she just keeps charging, not stopping
not slowing.

161
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:29,363
ASHLEY: Wait!

162
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:33,315
MATT: You eventually get outside. You guys watch
as Kaylie pushes past, and then Pike shortly

163
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:39,067
thereafter. She spins around, looking at you. You
can see her fists are clenched at her sides, face

164
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:44,681
still dry but you can see the water just slightly,
barely keeping back in her eyes. She goes,

165
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,535
"What?"

166
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:50,508
ASHLEY: Listen, I know how angry you are--

167
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,854
MATT: (sarcastically laughs)

168
00:23:52,854 --> 00:24:00,592
ASHLEY: --but we need you here today. So he can at
least have more of a chance to be the father that

169
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:03,521
you've always wanted him to be.

170
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:06,399
MATT: "Those days have passed I'm afraid."

171
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,477
ASHLEY: You have no idea how much he loves you.

172
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:17,364
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, he's- he's loved a lot of
girls in his days. That I'm certain."

173
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:23,267
ASHLEY: That may be true, but not as much as you

174
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:30,613
MATT: (sighs) "Well, get on with
it then. I figure at the very least we can go

175
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:38,569
"about our business when this is over. Clear
conscience and all that.

176
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:43,038
"How much time do you need?"

177
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,290
ASHLEY: As long as it takes.

178
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,112
MATT: "Well, have we time for a drink?"

179
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,724
ASHLEY: Uh, yes

180
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,077
MATT: "I'm going to get a drink."

181
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:58,013
And she just walks back into Whitestone.

182
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:01,602
TRAVIS: Am I still in there?

183
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:05,382
MATT: You're still in there, right now by
yourself, as Pike just pushed past you, and you

184
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:10,279
have Scanlan alone, on the altar.

185
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:23,267
TRAVIS: Can I go over to him? Does he look the
same?

186
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:32,947
MATT: He looks the same, just...paler. He's been
cleaned, so, the rest of you are a mess still, but

187
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:39,500
he's clean, his hair is pulled back and brushed a
bit by Pike as part of the preparation for the

188
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,009
ritual, his clothes still tattered and worn from
previous battles but--

189
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:55,973
TRAVIS: Can I reach out and put my hand on his
chest? Do I feel anything?

190
00:25:55,973 --> 00:26:04,120
MATT: Nothing. It's cold to the touch. He's been
gone for a while now and there's very little

191
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:14,014
difference between the touch of the stone he's on
and the chest other than the fleshy texture.

192
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:26,512
TRAVIS: This is not over. It can't be. (laughs).
We've done so much and we have so much more to do,

193
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:40,797
right? This is, this is not over. All right, don't,
don't you move. Go ahead and get your shut eye and

194
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:50,613
we'll be back. You rest here. Try not to have too
much fun without us.

195
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:52,321
And I leave.

196
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:59,126
MATT: Okay. Pike, you go in and finish the
preparations for the ritual. And the ritual itself

197
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:05,917
is an hour long once the spell is engaged. You're
just cleansing the temple, some of the leaves that

198
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:16,941
have blown in. What's everybody else doing in
the meantime?

199
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,278
LIAM: I'm just an assistant.

200
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:20,385
MARISHA: Same

201
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:26,622
TALIESIN: I'm organising, getting any materials
that we need

202
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:29,074
MATT: Okay. Kerrek?

203
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:39,158
PATRICK: I'm keeping my distance  but watching
what it is that they're getting ready to do here.

204
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:51,698
I'm half way between disbelief and wanting to see
how somebody else runs their priestly-- this is

205
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:59,241
sort of like a professional interest, what is this
guy doing to appease the Raven Queen this way?

206
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:09,668
MATT: Alrighty. You finish preparations. Kaylie
hasn't returned at that moment. About ten minutes

207
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:18,249
more pass and you hear small footsteps begin to
make their way to the outside of the temple.

208
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:31,177
There, stepping through, a little wobbly, but a
stoic, stone faced Kaylie, her hair kind of damp

209
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,030
and slicked back with her fingers  as she comes
through.

210
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:40,273
(sniffs) "All right, let's get it over with."

211
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:51,576
And you can smell the alcohol. She stumbles up to
the temple and puts her hands on the altar

212
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:53,166
"So, do your thing."

213
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:58,832
TRAVIS: Hold on. Look at me.

214
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:04,227
MATT: She turns around and looks up at you as she
is, practically, just past your thigh.

215
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:14,110
TRAVIS: It's so funny. I never realized it before.
You look so much like him.

216
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,534
MATT: Well be careful, I'm at the right height to
be juggling your-- (laughs half-heartedly)

217
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,553
TRAVIS: I'd expect no less

218
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:27,521
(laughter)

219
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:35,043
MATT: She lingers on your eye contact for a
second, gives a nod.  She gives you a tap

220
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,608
and turns back around, and puts her hands
on the altar.

221
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,639
TRAVIS: (groans) Right.

222
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,428
(laughter)

223
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:52,366
ASHLEY: Okay. I guess we'll go ahead and
get started. (sighs shakily)

224
00:29:52,366 --> 00:30:02,349
MATT: All right, so as Pike takes her holy symbol
out and begins preparing and burning the incense,

225
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:12,197
you, conscious that while you are a follower of
Sarenrae, you are in the space of the Raven Queen,

226
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:19,178
take heed to make sure that the symbols you
prepare as part of the ritual are a union of the

227
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:24,503
symbols of redemption, which call to your divine
nature, and the cycle of life, that are indicative

228
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:31,957
of the Raven Queen's spheres of both fate and
passing.  You orchestrate them in a way that is

229
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:39,914
synergistic, so that there is a definitive intent
to not let this life-line sever. As you finish the

230
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:47,426
completion of these various symbols and glyphs,
spreading the salts across with each line that is

231
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:59,252
drawn, you then begin to gather everyone around
the altar itself, closing the doors behind you.

232
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:06,433
You pull out the diamond component of this
resurrection ritual. If you want to mark it off

233
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:15,496
within your gear, either if you have a diamond
worth 1000 gold or just mark 1000 gold off.

234
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:21,812
LAURA: There's a diamond.

235
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:28,679
MATT: At which point you take the diamond and
place it over Scanlan's chest, and you begin

236
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,815
uttering the incantation. What begins as a small
whisper begins to echo, and you hear the source of

237
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:42,547
the voice from Pike, but within a minute, it's
almost like the voice is sourceless. It begins to

238
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:48,074
fill the room. It seeps from every corner. We hear
Pike from all sides, and the more she begins to

239
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:56,770
chant, the more you hear this very faint chorus
begin to join in, a harmonizing voice. A secondary

240
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:03,467
harmonizing voice. And you are familiar with this.
This is the initiation of the ritual. This is the

241
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:09,494
reaching out to the soul, the bond, the thread
that maintains the connection of the spirit to the

242
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:24,096
prime material plane. Now, who would like to make
a contribution to the ritual?

243
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:41,113
TRAVIS: I'll go. I step up, and I take my
Titanstone Knuckles off. I take the Belt of

244
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:55,096
Dwarvenkind off and I wrap it around the knuckles,
and I lay it next to Scanlan, and I say,

245
00:32:55,096 --> 00:33:03,450
You've been with me through so much. I pride 
myself on my strength, but as we fought

246
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:09,254
Earthbreaker Groon, you were there by my side 
as I learned that my true strength comes from my

247
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:21,759
friends, which means that these trinkets, no 
matter how strong they are, mean nothing. You

248
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:31,178
knew me before then, and I would hope you would 
know me after. While my best buddy Pike taught

249
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:43,762
me to love, you taught me to laugh, and I don't 
want to know what life is like without that. And

250
00:33:43,762 --> 00:33:51,862
the last thing I'd say is, you spent so many 
times inspiring me, I'd like to take a page from

251
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:59,161
your book. And to the tune of the Washington 
Redskins fight song--

252
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:00,641
(laughter around the table)

253
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:03,243
I sing 
(singing)

254
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:10,770
Hail to Scanlan Shorthalt 
Hail to victory!

255
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:24,355
No one can make me laugh faster. 
Please bring him back to me.

256
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:45,683
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check with
advantage.

257
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,101
TRAVIS: 14.

258
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:58,253
MATT: Okay. As Grog steps away, you watch as a
portion of the circular glyph pattern of the

259
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:04,852
ritual around you lights up, the first
contribution being presented.

260
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:10,949
Who wishes to take
the next presentation?

261
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,822
ASHLEY: I have a couple things to say but
I know I'm already--

262
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:19,471
MATT: Okay.

263
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:31,267
ASHLEY: I reach in my pocket and I
pull out a little doll, and--

264
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:42,442
Scanlan, I don't know if you remember this, but 
you gave this to me, and it's a little doll of you

265
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:49,583
Which is very appropriate.
But when I died, this saved my life because you

266
00:35:49,583 --> 00:36:00,038
gave it to me, and I didn't know that you had put
Healing Words in it. It saved me, and I hope that

267
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:05,312
today I can return the favor. 
I place that next to him.

268
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:20,530
I prepared a poem. I don't have it memorized, so
hold on.

269
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:27,731
Here lies Scanlan the bard, 
A gnome who sang soft but died hard.

270
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:33,312
To anyone who hears us, both far and wide, 
Bring us back our dirty friend

271
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:40,011
At least one more time. 
He may not be tall, or brute, or rough

272
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:47,981
He may be little, but his heart is buff. 
We are a party, and every party needs a clown,

273
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:52,877
Without our friend to reign us in we'll burn down
your whole fucking town.

274
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,194
(all laugh)

275
00:36:55,194 --> 00:37:02,824
You see, I love this gnome very much. 
He's small like me, but he's touched.

276
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:07,844
He's raided and slain, 
He's pooped while he sang,

277
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:13,596
But if he's gone forever I won't be the same

278
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:18,610
Now that he's learned he's a dad, 
The journey that all of us had

279
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,868
Cannot be in vain 
Will not be in waste.

280
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:43,058
Please, Scanlan, open your eyes and see your
daughter's face.

281
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:54,289
MATT: I'd say go ahead and make-- make a
performance check with advantage.

282
00:37:54,289 --> 00:38:04,032
ASHLEY: Okay.

283
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:11,202
ASHLEY: Okay, that's good, that's good.

284
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:15,613
I just rolled a natural 20.

285
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:18,703
(Matt laughs)

286
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:24,559
ASHLEY: Oh man. Okay, okay.

287
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:33,587
MATT: All right. As you finish the
poem you had wrote and step back, the second of

288
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:40,055
the three portions of the circle comes aglow, and
you realize, as she was speaking this poem, the

289
00:38:40,055 --> 00:38:44,236
chanting that she had begun has just continued
without her, like as the ritual continues the

290
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:49,747
chanting seems to have been taken and echoed by
the actual essence of the spell. As she stepped

291
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:56,581
out of the incantation it continued on its own; it
continues to swell, stronger and stronger. At this

292
00:38:56,581 --> 00:39:06,204
point as you step back, there's a flash of
movement at the edge of the altar, and with a

293
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:13,228
double clack of her shoes, you watch Kaylie land
her flip onto the top of the altar, stand up

294
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:20,671
straight, wobble for a second, and catch her-- she
pulls out her fiddle.

295
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:28,357
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait-- I just take her wrist.

296
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:32,660
It's no small thing to have a father who loves
you.

297
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:40,562
And I cast Lay on Hands and clear her mind of
the alcohol.

298
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:45,026
MATT: Her instinct is to pull away as you grasp
her wrist, as it is instinctive for any man who

299
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:51,354
tries to lay a hand on her. In a moment she fights
the instinct, and as the healing energy flows

300
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:58,737
through her arm she closes her eyes, and for the
first time since she arrived, you watch as the

301
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:06,750
tears that she had kept at bay blink down her
cheek, finally. She reaches over and taps your

302
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:19,604
hand twice with her bow, and still not making eye
contact with you, just nods, and begins to play a

303
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:31,867
beautiful, soft, sad violin piece that begins to
swell faster and faster and faster and transition

304
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:40,857
from a mournful piece of remembrance into a
lively, jovial fiddle piece. The music begins to

305
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:46,110
pick up, and she begins to dance, her feet
clacking across the top of the altar. The

306
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:52,387
juxtaposition of the energy and the emotion of the
room towards this strange rush of energy and

307
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:58,260
liveliness is awkward at first, and then welcome,
and you can't help but, in spite of yourselves,

308
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:05,211
smile. The sound fills the room as she goes faster
and faster and faster, her feet clacking, faster

309
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:10,067
and faster, across the stone work on the top. She
brings it to a giant crescendo, finishes with a

310
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:15,423
flourish, the bow (makes a whooshing noise)
outside. She puts her head up, and you see the

311
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:24,138
tears streak down her face, no smile, just a stone
expression, and she gives a bow.

312
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:34,034
That's a performance check on that. The third, and
final, portion of the ritual begins to swell. As

313
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:47,090
the magic crescendos, we take into account the
final roll.

314
00:41:47,090 --> 00:42:13,343
I'm going to post this right now. And I assure you
guys, this is what got rolled.

315
00:42:13,343 --> 00:42:23,281
MATT: As the divine energies of the ritual swell,
you watch as the energy shoots across, stepping

316
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:30,068
into the diamond that's still on his chest. You
watch as the divine powers--

317
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:34,569
The diamond swells with bright energy
before (explosion sound effect) shattering into a

318
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:40,534
diamond dust across his chest, across the altar,
clattering to the ground like a glittering handful

319
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:50,638
of sand just tossed across his body. The glyphs
fade and grow cold, the light of the room descends

320
00:42:50,638 --> 00:43:03,118
into the same low-lit candlelight that you
presented to the ritual, Pike. A moment passes.

321
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:14,885
Another moment passes. Another moment passes, and

322
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:19,398
eyes still closed, you watch as a small smile
curls across Scanlan's face.

323
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:29,499
And his chest rises, and falls, and rises, and
falls.

324
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:37,301
As the relief spreads throughout the room,
Kaylie walks up,

325
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:40,374
"Wipe that smile off your face. We're gonna have a
talk."

326
00:43:40,374 --> 00:43:47,086
and slaps his face the other way, jumps off the
altar, slams out the two doors to the front,

327
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:57,282
and staggers out of the temple into the outside.

328
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:59,734
Scanlan still lays unconscious but breathing.

329
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:03,585
I rolled a natural fucking 20, by the way 
guys, on that final roll.

330
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:04,588
TRAVIS: Did you really?

331
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:05,586
ASHLEY: No way.

332
00:44:05,586 --> 00:44:09,005
MATT: It's right there. I haven't touched it since
it landed.

333
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:10,601
MARISHA: That was two natural 20s.

334
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,048
ASHLEY: Two!

335
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:15,414
MATT: Two natural 20s. It was 14 for Kaylie's
performance roll, and then a 20.

336
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:16,525
LAURA: You know,

337
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:17,687
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

338
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,528
LAURA: The fates just wanted Scanlan to
come back.

339
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:23,338
MARISHA: It's true. And he was all poo-pooing on
the dice

340
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:24,477
LAURA: I know.

341
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:29,565
MATT: There was--I mean with the DC increase,
because he was at a 12. I missaid 13 last week, it

342
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:36,078
was a 12, and we had two successes and one
failure. That brought it from a 13, ten, to a

343
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:39,420
seven. So we had a one through six and he would
have been good.

344
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,051
LAURA: Oh, good.

345
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,990
ASHLEY:  That responsibility is so scary.

346
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,089
MATT: Yeah. Anyway.

347
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:59,083
As you all take in the moment, it appears 
that Scanlan's spirit has returned to the body.

348
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:04,518
TRAVIS: Anybody wanna wake him up?

349
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:10,334
TALIESIN: No. I don't think so, not yet.

350
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:14,945
MARISHA: Keyleth goes up and does a simple
medicine check, just to see what's up with him.

351
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:20,103
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and roll it.

352
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:21,854
MARISHA: 18.

353
00:45:21,854 --> 00:45:31,428
MATT: Okay. He is alive, and he's breathing. His
body has been ravaged by the experience and trauma

354
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:36,395
of death. His body has been ravaged by the trauma
of the resurrection.

355
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:39,033
He is borderline comatose
right now.

356
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:41,784
LAURA: Oh, God.

357
00:45:41,784 --> 00:45:45,806
MATT: You've seen trauma have this
impact on bodies before.

358
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:48,936
It could be minutes, hours, days, who knows?

359
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:55,653
But with the right treatment, usually people 
recover. It's not like a heavy skull trauma

360
00:45:55,653 --> 00:46:03,252
induced coma, it's just the physical exhaustion 
of the experience. So there may or may not be

361
00:46:03,252 --> 00:46:11,413
something you could do at the moment to rouse 
him from his slumber, but Scanlan lives.

362
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:13,728
MARISHA: I think he needs his rest.

363
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:19,934
Percy, can we station some of the best 
sages and doctors to watch over him?

364
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:22,450
TALIESIN: We take him to the castle, I suppose, at
this point.

365
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,928
MARISHA: Yes.

366
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:24,900
TRAVIS: Yeah.

367
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,853
TALIESIN: He'll be taken care of.

368
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,594
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I carry him?

369
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:34,179
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Of course.

370
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:35,895
TRAVIS: I pick him up.

371
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:42,747
MATT: Okay. He's warmer now.

372
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:45,959
TRAVIS: That's better.

373
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:48,673
MATT: He's also drooling a little bit, and may
have wet himself a second time.

374
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,986
TRAVIS: That's more like it. Yeah, that's
appropriate.

375
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:52,840
(all laugh)

376
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,571
MATT: But he's warmer.

377
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:58,262
TRAVIS: Everyone, he may have pissed himself.

378
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:00,051
(all laugh)

379
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:03,165
Just remind him later.

380
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:04,438
ASHLEY: It happens.

381
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:05,933
LIAM: The more things change...

382
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:08,650
(all laugh)

383
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,315
MATT: All right, as you guys begin to 
step outside--

384
00:47:12,315 --> 00:47:20,748
Kerrek, you're there at the door after Kaylie
charged out. Kima and Allura, who are just waiting

385
00:47:20,748 --> 00:47:28,507
outside, respectfully, are kind of engaged, but
you watch as Kima immediately pushes up

386
00:47:28,507 --> 00:47:32,693
"Is he--?"

387
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:34,457
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

388
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:40,134
MATT: "(sighs and then scoffs) And you were
worried. So dumb."

389
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:42,892
(laughs all around)

390
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:47,787
Allura steps up behind her and puts her hands on
Kima's shoulders and goes,

391
00:47:47,787 --> 00:48:00,970
"Well, that's good news. Take care of him. We'll 
probably return to Emon and help helm the

392
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:08,126
"remainder of the cleaning, and situation, of Emon:
gather the dead, see who we still have alive,

393
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:15,036
"and come back soon with an 
idea of what we have to rebuild."

394
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:17,045
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

395
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:17,907
MATT: Sure.

396
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:23,656
MARISHA: She seems worried. Is something wrong?

397
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:25,019
MARISHA: 26.

398
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:31,552
MATT: 26.

399
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:33,255
ASHLEY: So, lootcrate.

400
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:34,947
(everyone laughs)

401
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:37,139
LAURA: So building, huh?

402
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,019
ASHLEY: It's such a cool thing, what they have
this month.

403
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,565
LAURA: (laughs)

404
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:49,801
ASHLEY: You know, if you love power rangers and
leegos. I love leegos.

405
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,376
TRAVIS: You know, man, these lootcrates are great.

406
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:54,034
ASHLEY: Can't do it like Sam.

407
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:54,792
MATT: Who can, though?

408
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:55,809
TRAVIS: If you haven't got one, you should.

409
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,253
LIAM: Hey everybody. Scanlan's still in the game.

410
00:48:57,253 --> 00:49:00,036
(all cheer)

411
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:02,132
LIAM: (badly plays a flute)

412
00:49:02,132 --> 00:49:07,510
(all laugh)

413
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,438
MARISHA: Do you have to leave immediately? You
seem tired.

414
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:14,197
We've all been through a lot. You
should rest a day.

415
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:20,410
MATT:  I mean, I have to rest before I can find
our way back to Emon quicker, but the sooner the

416
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:27,098
better. We did kind of leave the city in a vacuum
of leadership, depending on who survived the

417
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:33,799
conflict there, and I want to make sure that we
have whatever remains of the council there to put

418
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:43,767
the pieces back together and count the dead; make
sure we don't leave a vacuum of power so that

419
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:50,836
another Thordak-like entity can sweep in and lead
us back on a dark path.

420
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,937
MARISHA: Let us know if you need our assistance

421
00:49:52,937 --> 00:50:00,484
MATT: " I shall. (sighs) I, for one, need to get
clean."

422
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:03,584
She taps Kima's shoulders, and Kima says,

423
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,406
"Me too,"

424
00:50:05,406 --> 00:50:12,431
and they both walk up towards the
castle. What do you guys want to do?

425
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:16,673
TALIESIN: I am going to go back the castle, sit
down, take this off,

426
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:20,771
and I think sleep for a long
while.

427
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,929
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. What time of day is it?

428
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:31,780
MATT: At this time, the arrival here... It's
pushing past sunset, I'm pretty sure. Or if not,

429
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,263
it's probably early night at this time with the
hour for the ritual, so--

430
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:40,025
TRAVIS: Where are we dropping off the urine
smelling one?

431
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:43,854
TALIESIN: We'll take him to his room. I'll make
sure someone cleans him up,

432
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:47,119
dresses him, puts his
things away.

433
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,396
TRAVIS: All right.

434
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:54,326
TALIESIN: You're welcome to take him to his room.

435
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:55,734
TRAVIS: I do that.

436
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,183
ASHLEY: I'll go with Grog and Scanlan.

437
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,946
MATT: Okay. Kerrek?

438
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:07,309
PATRICK: I probably just drift along in everyone's
wake at this point.

439
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:18,122
MATT: Okay. Staggering behind a bit, just
ruminating on the current events. Vex, you are

440
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:23,895
still back at Kymal with Eskil Ryndarien, who has
come back with drinks and says,

441
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:32,079
"So...what business have you here, to drag me 
this far out to town?"

442
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:38,833
LAURA: I thought you were grabbing a room, Eskil.
Aren't you tired? Just so tired.

443
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,536
(laughter)

444
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:43,525
MATT: "Well, I suppose--"

445
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:47,225
LAURA: We probably need our sleep right so that we
can recharge

446
00:51:47,225 --> 00:51:49,927
those spells of yours as soon as
possible.

447
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:52,282
MATT: I just want you to know that I'm not
interested.

448
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:53,693
(laughter)

449
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,407
LAURA: (dryly) Oh, are you sure, darling? You're
so attractive to me.

450
00:51:56,407 --> 00:52:00,763
MATT: I understand that, and I've had my heyday,
but those years are long past me now.

451
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:03,616
LAURA: Well, you better get to bed before I jump
on you.

452
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:05,181
(all laugh)

453
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:09,137
MATT: And he seems legitimately really disturbed
and walks away.

454
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:12,096
LAURA: I sit down next to Doctor Dranzel.

455
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:18,338
MATT: Okay, he's sitting. He's actually half
passed out now, in the back corner. He wasn't

456
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:25,363
there for the whole exchange with Kaylie. His
hat's pushed over his eyes, and he has an empty

457
00:52:25,363 --> 00:52:31,240
tankard there in his one hand. You don't see where
his other hand is. And you sit down?

458
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,982
LAURA: I look to see where his other hand is.

459
00:52:33,982 --> 00:52:39,694
MATT: All right. You glance under the table and
you come right face to face with a crossbow that

460
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:44,093
is under the table pointed in your direction, and
without moving, you hear him grin under his chin.

461
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:47,569
"(laughs) Nice try, Vex'ahlia."

462
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:51,919
LAURA: (laughs) Just seeing what it was, dear.
Didn't want to sit on it.

463
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,532
MATT: So do you know my coin is mine?

464
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:56,258
LAURA: As is mine.

465
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:59,818
MATT: (chuckles) He puts the hat up a bit over his
eyes now, and you can see him.

466
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:04,053
He gives you a sort
a brow push.

467
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:07,144
LAURA: Did you hear what I said to Kaylie?

468
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:08,973
MATT: As much as I could from a distance, yeah.

469
00:53:08,973 --> 00:53:15,777
Seems our old pal finally had his adventures catch
up to him.

470
00:53:15,777 --> 00:53:18,522
LAURA: How do you feel about that?

471
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:23,060
MATT: I've had friends come and go through the
years. It's part of the job.

472
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,710
LAURA: That can't be true. That cold...

473
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:32,880
MATT: Well, no. Each one hurts, but-- Look, doll,
I've lived in some of the harshest landscapes

474
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,640
Tal'dorei and beyond has to see. I've watched
people torn asunder in the streets before me.

475
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,048
I have--

476
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,035
LAURA: I hold onto my purse the entire time
talking to him.

477
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:42,763
MATT: Okay.

478
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:45,036
(all laugh)

479
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:48,533
TALIESIN: That was so subtle.

480
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:55,593
MATT: Make a perception check.

481
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:57,527
LIAM: There's a lot in there.

482
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:59,517
LAURA: Motherfuck.

483
00:53:59,517 --> 00:54:01,601
TRAVIS: You know your own kind.

484
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:03,219
LAURA: 22.

485
00:54:03,219 --> 00:54:11,951
MATT: 22. You catch the crossbow still placed
there, but his other hand has slipped underneath

486
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,038
and has been slowly reaching toward your-

487
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:15,965
LAURA: Trying to cop a feel, darling?

488
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:17,944
MATT: (laughs) Always.

489
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:25,266
TRAVIS: (laughing) He wiped a nose on his cheek.

490
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:27,614
MARISHA: So crass.

491
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:34,440
MATT: But, yeah. Not cold, just pragmatic. When
you lose enough people you learn to just move on.

492
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,407
LAURA: Yeah, but Scanlan's special.

493
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:43,635
MATT: He's a special pain in my ass. Nah, he's
great. He'll be missed.

494
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:51,066
LAURA: He will be. To Scanlan

495
00:54:51,066 --> 00:55:00,982
MATT: To Scanlan Shorthalt and our brief but very
lucrative carrier together. By the way, if you're

496
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:06,012
curious, we're looking to sell off some of this
really nice silverware that we--

497
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,674
LAURA: You motherfucker.

498
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:11,625
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's right, it's ours. Shit.

499
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:15,970
MATT: He just smiles at you, his big bright toothy
grin.

500
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:20,654
LAURA: You're lucky that our keep was under attack
and everything else got ransacked.

501
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:23,070
Otherwise, I'd come after you.

502
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,640
MATT: I'm always lucky. That's why I'm still
alive.

503
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,550
LAURA: Well, give some of your luck to Scanlan.
I'm going to bed.

504
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:37,344
MATT: All right. I've got a few more of these to
put down. Stay safe, Vex'ahlia.

505
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:43,924
LAURA: Yeah. Don't come to my room. I'm serious,
don't.

506
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,032
MATT: He looks legitimately-- like the wink
afterward--

507
00:55:46,032 --> 00:55:49,529
his face has a mixed signals
expression.

508
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,654
(all laugh)

509
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,066
TRAVIS: Question mark.

510
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:54,951
ASHLEY: Don't come to my room.

511
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,359
MATT: I'm not sure if you're serious...

512
00:55:58,359 --> 00:55:59,956
LAURA: But seriously, don't.

513
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:03,086
MATT: Right, right, no. Gotcha. Psh, yes, fine.

514
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:08,077
Besides, you seem like you're already shacking up
with a... curious gentleman.

515
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:10,286
LAURA: (sarcastically) Isn't he dreamy?

516
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:11,657
And I head upstairs.

517
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:13,146
MATT: "Strange bedfellows."

518
00:56:13,146 --> 00:56:15,251
(all laugh)

519
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:17,270
He goes and orders another round.

520
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:22,420
You go ahead and find yourself up there 
with two separate rooms purchased by Eskil,

521
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,811
all the way across the hall. He rapidly hands 
you the key, and says without making eye contact,

522
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:29,307
"Your room is at the end, please, yes,"

523
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:37,631
and finds his way. You hear the door
(clicking sound) and lock behind him

524
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:42,365
LAURA: I stay up for a really long time waiting to
hear any kind of word from Allura,

525
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:46,018
from anybody... Something.

526
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:48,375
MATT: Well, nobody told Allura to contact you.

527
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,465
LAURA: Nope, they didn't.

528
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:50,452
MATT: No.

529
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:51,459
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

530
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:53,188
LAURA: So I'll eventually go to sleep, wondering
if Scanlan's alive.

531
00:56:53,188 --> 00:56:55,480
MARISHA: We weren't done on our side.

532
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,411
ASHLEY: We can't-- that's-- the earrings--

533
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:59,688
TALIESIN: Technically, chronologically, it
wouldn't have happened yet, yeah?

534
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:05,326
MATT: Yeah. So, as she is going throughout the
room and napping through the day--

535
00:57:05,326 --> 00:57:13,064
It's taken you guys hours to prepare the ritual, 
bring Kaylie there, the whole circumstance,

536
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:16,177
so yeah, she's been up for a few hours, waiting.

537
00:57:16,177 --> 00:57:19,573
The rest of you guys back at the castle, anything 
else you want to prep for the evening?

538
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:23,377
LIAM: In the meantime I wander over to Kerrek,
just for a minute, and I say

539
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:29,632
Kerr, I'm really terrible about lending my stuff. 
I forget who I've given what,

540
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:30,960
and sometimes it doesn't come back.

541
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,475
(all laugh)

542
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:37,786
LIAM: Could I, I'm so sorry, could I trouble you
for that ring back, please?

543
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:43,403
PATRICK: Oh, oh, oh. No, he just takes it off. He
hands it back.

544
00:57:43,403 --> 00:57:44,942
TRAVIS: Aww, damn it.

545
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:46,347
LAURA: That was awesome!

546
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:50,855
LIAM: Thank you, thank you. Oh, that is beautiful.
Right back where it belongs.

547
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:53,322
MARISHA: Keyleth taps Vax and says,

548
00:57:53,322 --> 00:57:56,796
Smooth. Nice one.

549
00:57:56,796 --> 00:57:58,644
LIAM: That's me.

550
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:04,340
MARISHA: And I turn to Kerrek and just give him a
massive hug.

551
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:12,676
Thank you so much for following us
into the fray. Literally, into the pit of the

552
00:58:12,676 --> 00:58:22,107
beast-- So, thank you. There's not a lot of people
who would blindly follow us there.

553
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:29,664
PATRICK: It was a pleasure, and it was a double
pleasure to actually come out again.

554
00:58:29,664 --> 00:58:36,830
MARISHA: I don't know if would say risking your
life is a pleasure, but I appreciate your positive

555
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:41,590
attitude on the whole thing. (chuckles)

556
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:50,269
PATRICK: It was nice to have something to do
again. Something worthwhile to do again.

557
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:59,225
MARISHA: I'd say you definitely spent your time
wisely. What do you plan to do next?

558
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:08,900
PATRICK: If you folk are heading back to the city
tomorrow, I should meet up with my people. They

559
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:17,638
don't need me to shepherd them, exactly, but I
should head back with them.

560
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:30,336
MARISHA: Okay. Well, thank you for everything.
Sincerely.

561
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:34,440
I give him another hug and say
goodnight and go in the castle.

562
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,731
MATT: Okay

563
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:42,798
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay with Scanlan for a bit.
Just for the night.

564
00:59:42,877 --> 00:59:46,271
MATT: Okay, so you take him back to his chamber.

565
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:49,237
You stay next to him as he's sleeping, making sure
he's okay.

566
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:52,644
All right. Everyone else, just--

567
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:54,921
TRAVIS: I'm just staying outside his room.

568
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:55,730
MATT: Okay.

569
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:01,012
MARISHA: I then go, I was going to go find Allura
and actually ask her if she had a message spell or

570
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:05,282
a sending spell, and I was totally gonna do that
before

571
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:07,176
(all laugh)

572
01:00:07,176 --> 01:00:13,030
everyone staring making the jokes about us being
shitty and forgetting.

573
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,587
Because that would be
awful--

574
01:00:14,587 --> 01:00:16,958
TALIESIN: I was really looking forward to it, to
be honest.

575
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,873
MARISHA: --to wait for 12 hours to figure out if
your friend is alive or dead.

576
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:24,497
(all singing) Somewhere out there--

577
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:32,135
MATT: Yeah, as you go find her, she's already 
in her night clothes

578
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:34,133
and has brought her hair down and is like,

579
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:38,362
"Yes, actually, I can.
Thank you for reminding me."

580
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:44,921
MARISHA: She must be insane right now, or half
drunk, or both.

581
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:45,926
MATT: Probably both.

582
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:47,729
MARISHA: Yeah, I would be.

583
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,970
MATT: I will make sure she knows.

584
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:51,455
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

585
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:55,501
MATT: Of course, of course. Sleep well. You've
done-- you've done good.

586
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:57,691
MARISHA: You, too. Thank you.

587
01:00:57,691 --> 01:01:02,329
MATT: You've all finished what I started.

588
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:07,134
MARISHA: I think we'll head back with you tomorrow
to Emon so we can check in on our keep,

589
01:01:07,134 --> 01:01:09,688
once Vex'ahila comes back, of course

590
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:16,329
MATT: "Very well. I can bring most of you with me.
Should not be an issue.

591
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:19,832
All right, rest well. Have a good night."

592
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:25,064
She goes back inside.

593
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:32,797
PATRICK: Kerrek will probably track down a bottle
of some kind of

594
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:41,637
really strong liquor and look for Grog.

595
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:45,840
MATT: Okay, it doesn't take you long to find it.
You've seen where they keep most of it and since

596
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:53,817
you're already an esteemed guest of the keepers
here of Whitestone, they have given you a bottle,

597
01:01:53,817 --> 01:02:01,888
already open, but promised to have been fine
quality and it doesn't take you long to hear the

598
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:08,837
various bodily functions of Grog Strongjaw in the
hallway, watching Scanlan's room. As it's

599
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:15,451
now the middle of the night, close to midnight or
so, you come across Grog alone leaning up against

600
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:21,108
the wall, arms crossed, just waiting outside of
Scanlan's room.

601
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:29,686
PATRICK: And I just kind of pass the bottle over
and say,

602
01:02:29,686 --> 01:02:37,409
Well, this is a better sort of vigil than
what I've seen in the past.

603
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:45,744
TRAVIS: Why, that is true, that could have been
much-- what is this?

604
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:52,849
PATRICK: They seemed really impressed that
they were giving it to me.

605
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:54,411
TRAVIS: They gave it to you. You didn't--

606
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:57,714
PATRICK: That's the extent of my knowledge. It
looks brownish.

607
01:02:57,714 --> 01:03:03,725
TRAVIS: You didn't pay for it, no coin. You don't
know if it's, like, cheap or expensive.

608
01:03:03,725 --> 01:03:10,842
PATRICK: Yeah, I'm guessing it's top shelf, not
that I would know.

609
01:03:10,842 --> 01:03:13,358
TRAVIS: Hold on, let an expert take a taste.

610
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:16,134
And I take a sip.

611
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:19,337
(all laugh)

612
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:23,257
TRAVIS: Do I detect any notes of stuff?

613
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:26,760
MATT: Roll an intelligence check.

614
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:33,035
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. That's a three... No,
that's a one.

615
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:40,681
MATT: You detect notes of alcohol. Very strong
alcohol.

616
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,073
LAURA: And liquid.

617
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:48,438
TRAVIS: Yes, this is clearly the finest reserve
alcohol of the... area.

618
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:54,868
We shall enjoy this to great lengths. May I 
commend you on the acquisition of a great--

619
01:03:54,868 --> 01:04:03,478
I think I just stroked
out on that word. Here.

620
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:07,170
PATRICK: And so I just kind of share some space.

621
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:16,805
We chat a bit, and then I kind of bring up that
whole resurrection ritual, slowly like,

622
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:22,801
So that sort of thing has happened before 
with you folks?

623
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:28,012
TRAVIS: Yeah, it has, unfortunately. A bit too
often.

624
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:33,912
But I have to say, before this group, I
didn't even know people could do that, 'cause you

625
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:42,261
know me. I can't do anything like that. Have you
ever done one of those?

626
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:56,191
PATRICK: I... No, no. I... (sighs) I've looked
into things like that,

627
01:04:56,191 --> 01:05:01,124
but I've never known
anyone who's actually come back.

628
01:05:01,124 --> 01:05:03,918
TRAVIS: Really?

629
01:05:03,918 --> 01:05:06,991
PATRICK: Yeah.

630
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:14,212
TRAVIS: Wait, so are you saying, someone coming
back is rare?

631
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:26,862
PATRICK: I've, I mean, I've heard stories, and I
know, but I've never seen it myself and I've

632
01:05:26,862 --> 01:05:39,277
never... I don't know how much. I never knew how
practical any of the stories were before.

633
01:05:39,277 --> 01:05:48,426
TRAVIS: I don't really know how pra-- pracsti--
they are either, but I guess I hadn't really

634
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:55,845
thought about it much. It just seems like the
others in the group are responsible for it. This

635
01:05:55,845 --> 01:06:07,105
one was hard, though. I felt like it might not
work, you know?

636
01:06:07,105 --> 01:06:10,393
PATRICK: So it always works?

637
01:06:10,393 --> 01:06:22,007
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. I mean, of the ones I've seen.

638
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:34,075
PATRICK: And has it always been--? How-- do you
need a body?

639
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:41,917
TRAVIS: Uh... for what? To stay warm at night or
for a resurrection?

640
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,907
(all laugh)

641
01:06:43,907 --> 01:06:50,679
PATRICK: No no, for a-- have you ever brought
someone back when you didn't have the body?

642
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:56,645
TRAVIS: No?

643
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,366
PATRICK: I expected that couldn't happen.

644
01:06:58,366 --> 01:07:06,099
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Cause that would be-- what
would you use? Like, you can't bring along, like,

645
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:12,415
a tea cosy and then be like bam! You're back! How
would that even work? What are you talking about?

646
01:07:12,415 --> 01:07:15,349
PATRICK: Exactly, how would any of that work?

647
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:21,550
And that is about as subtle as Kerrek can be at
this point.

648
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:29,126
Awake for three days and two wars and
a dragon. That's why he's desperately trying to

649
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:33,025
pump Grog for information about how the hell
someone can come back--

650
01:07:33,025 --> 01:07:34,268
TRAVIS: You picked the wrong source.

651
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:35,742
(all laugh)

652
01:07:35,742 --> 01:07:36,511
MATT: Yeah.

653
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:41,625
TRAVIS: You know, if you have questions, the wall
behind me also knows probably as much as I do.

654
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,121
(all laugh)

655
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:52,900
PATRICK: And that's like, this is especially the
only person I could trust to not realize that I

656
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,414
was trying to get information out of him on this
subject.

657
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:58,742
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

658
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:06,591
PATRICK: And then when it does not-- when it dead
ends, I just drink as much of that bottle as I

659
01:08:06,591 --> 01:08:13,120
can, moving it back and forth between the two of
us for the rest of the night.

660
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,538
TRAVIS: I'm good with that.

661
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:16,441
ASHLEY: Do I hear them at all on the other side of
the door?

662
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:21,357
MATT: You hear them muttering from across the
wall, but do you wanna listen in?

663
01:08:21,357 --> 01:08:24,289
TALIESIN: I was actually hoping to be around the
corner for a chunk of this,

664
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:26,491
'cause I was heading to
Scanlan's room as well.

665
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:28,122
MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks.

666
01:08:28,122 --> 01:08:28,764
ASHLEY: Okay.

667
01:08:28,764 --> 01:08:33,005
TALIESIN: Awesome.

668
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:38,414
TRAVIS: So you, like, you take a big shiny thing,
and then someone starts like "ay-ay-ah".

669
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:39,074
TALIESIN: 14.

670
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:41,885
ASHLEY: 19.

671
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,306
MATT: You're around the way.

672
01:08:43,306 --> 01:08:46,910
You catch the tail end of the conversation, 
just the questioning back and forth.

673
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:54,464
You pick up bits and pieces of it, and you're 
able to make out the gist of the conversation.

674
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:59,362
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm gonna peek my head out the door.

675
01:08:59,362 --> 01:09:03,896
MATT: Okay, as you guys are finishing passing the
bottle back and forth, Scanlan's door opens and

676
01:09:03,947 --> 01:09:07,533
Pike just barely pushes her head out from the
crack.

677
01:09:07,533 --> 01:09:08,458
ASHLEY: Hey.

678
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:13,813
TRAVIS: Aaah! Oh my god!

679
01:09:13,813 --> 01:09:21,140
ASHLEY: What are you drinking? And why didn't you
bring some to me?

680
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,142
TRAVIS: Shit. Really good point. We might be in
trouble, Kerr.

681
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:35,065
PATRICK: I... have made a terrible mistake. But it
is one that I can fix.

682
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:40,171
And I know this is why the
gods gave us two hands.

683
01:09:40,171 --> 01:09:43,449
I will bring back two
bottles.

684
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:46,127
TRAVIS: Is this why the gods gave us two hands?

685
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:48,579
(all laugh)

686
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:53,584
TRAVIS: They gave us two hands for two bott--
Pike, I am so wise right now.

687
01:09:53,584 --> 01:09:58,266
ASHLEY: You are--that must be like an intelligence
serum.

688
01:09:58,266 --> 01:10:01,347
TRAVIS: Serum. Did they teach you that in your
Sarenrae temple classes,

689
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:07,468
because if not, maybe you
have a thing or two to teach them now.

690
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:11,429
ASHLEY: Probably not, Grog, but thank you.

691
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:13,644
TALIESIN: All right, now I am coming around the
corner. I've waited long enough.

692
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:20,877
MATT: So, Percival, you hear just enough to hear
the talk about needing a body and then alcohol.

693
01:10:20,877 --> 01:10:26,607
TRAVIS: Percy, the gods gave you two hands for
bottles for each of them!

694
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:29,822
TALIESIN: Four if you can learn to use your feet.

695
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:33,099
TRAVIS: That's too much. My brain will explode.

696
01:10:33,099 --> 01:10:37,780
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him, since I knew,
since I could hear what was going on?

697
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:41,187
MATT: Uh, sure. Make it with disadvantage, because
it was through a wall.

698
01:10:41,187 --> 01:10:42,953
ASHLEY: Okay.

699
01:10:42,953 --> 01:10:45,669
MATT: It's hard to pick up nuances without seeing
expressions and stuff.

700
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:47,989
LIAM: It's just bass.

701
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:53,070
MATT: Yeah, bass, practically.

702
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:54,549
ASHLEY: 18.

703
01:10:54,549 --> 01:10:58,952
MATT: 18? It's too hard to pick up without
the nuances. From through a wall, I mean, the fact

704
01:10:58,952 --> 01:11:05,632
that you could pick up any of the words is one
thing, but most of insight is based around facial

705
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:09,419
expressions, physical activity. You have no idea.

706
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:11,574
TRAVIS: Probably some intermittent farting.

707
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:16,066
MATT: That, too, yeah. So, you wander in. Kerr
wandered away.

708
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:20,799
TALIESIN: I am going to wander into the room, with
a nod and just sit for a moment.

709
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:26,195
TRAVIS: Wait. Prove that you're you.

710
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:27,722
TALIESIN: No.

711
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:28,797
TRAVIS: It's you.

712
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:39,708
(all laugh)

713
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:42,150
TALIESIN: I love you so much.

714
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,857
MATT: All right, so you sit for a bit, Kerr
eventually returns

715
01:11:44,857 --> 01:11:48,809
with a second bottle of
matching alcohol, unopened though, the same--

716
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:51,724
PATRICK:  Two, two hands.

717
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,559
MATT: Oh, so you go for a third bottle as well.

718
01:11:54,559 --> 01:11:55,450
PATRICK: Yes.

719
01:11:55,450 --> 01:12:01,096
MATT: Two unopened bottles of the same brackish
liquor.

720
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:10,592
PATRICK: And I'll pass one to both of the people,
that I was not drinking with before.

721
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,864
I'll pass them off.

722
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:15,355
MATT: Okay, so Pike and Percival, you have a fresh
bottle jammed into your hand.

723
01:12:15,355 --> 01:12:17,909
ASHLEY: One for me.

724
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:24,458
TALIESIN: I'll be passing this around a bit.

725
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:29,717
ASHLEY: Should we all sit on the bed around
Scanlan, like a slumber party?

726
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:31,541
TRAVIS: Is that creepy?

727
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:34,437
TALIESIN: Honestly I am thinking about going
through his things, so no, I don't think it is.

728
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:37,568
TRAVIS: Well, okay.

729
01:12:37,568 --> 01:12:39,891
(fart noise)

730
01:12:39,891 --> 01:12:43,818
MATT: Scanlan is definitely alive.

731
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:54,155
ASHLEY: Oh my god. What were you guys talking
about out there? If I can be so rude to ask.

732
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:55,578
TRAVIS: Oh, us?

733
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:59,307
PATRICK: Uh, the liquor, it has fabulous brackish
notes.

734
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:03,880
TRAVIS: Yep. Notes of brack.

735
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,095
ASHLEY: Great, great.

736
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:08,797
TALIESIN: Thank you. We make it here.

737
01:13:08,797 --> 01:13:17,353
TRAVIS: I was also talking about what a great job
you do. Apparently, you're really rare.

738
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:19,400
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

739
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:24,062
TRAVIS: Like, like, apparently, you and your
resurrections, like, they don't always work.

740
01:13:24,062 --> 01:13:26,445
Which is amazing.

741
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,792
ASHLEY: They don't always work.

742
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:30,066
TRAVIS: I didn't know that.

743
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:35,064
ASHLEY: They don't. We've been very fortunate.
We've been very fortunate.

744
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:40,312
What, did you-- why do you ask, Kerr?

745
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:49,038
PATRICK: I've never actually seen anything like
that before. It was quite an experience.

746
01:13:49,038 --> 01:13:51,003
Am I still wearing my armor?

747
01:13:51,003 --> 01:13:52,740
I might actually ask that
out loud.

748
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,418
(all laugh)

749
01:13:54,418 --> 01:14:01,664
MATT: And he is. He is still wearing his armor,
unwashed. A few of you have gotten washed, a few

750
01:14:01,664 --> 01:14:05,359
of you are still kind of, you know, going over the
events of today. Grog is not washed.

751
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:06,589
LAURA: Grog never washes.

752
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:07,253
MATT: Yes.

753
01:14:07,253 --> 01:14:08,802
TRAVIS: Perfume de Grog.

754
01:14:08,802 --> 01:14:10,890
MATT: So yes, he is still wearing his armor.

755
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:19,004
PATRICK: You get the marvelous spectacle of a
slightly older, slightly portly man shrugging out

756
01:14:19,004 --> 01:14:27,656
of a full suit of chainmail. It's entertaining.

757
01:14:27,656 --> 01:14:40,095
And then just like dumps it on the floor, and then
like the padding underneath. (groans)

758
01:14:40,095 --> 01:14:43,380
TRAVIS: That's a lot of shit you're wearing, man.

759
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:53,687
PATRICK: You know what I forgot over all these
years, like the sweat gathers in your ass.

760
01:14:53,687 --> 01:14:55,120
ASHLEY: Swamp ass.

761
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,886
MARISHA: Swamp ass. Swamp crack, yeah.

762
01:14:56,886 --> 01:14:58,641
ASHLEY: It's a thing.

763
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:04,958
PATRICK: You'd think that I would remember but no,
I had forgotten that.

764
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:15,715
TALIESIN: I forget, and then suddenly I remember
that I met you all in a prison cell.

765
01:15:15,715 --> 01:15:20,335
ASHLEY: I remember very well.

766
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:22,205
TALIESIN: It's not fair, is it?

767
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:23,623
TRAVIS: What?

768
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:32,197
TALIESIN: It's just, one day you lose so many
people and then just one day you stop.

769
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:42,204
And at one point in your life you decide that 
suddenly for no reason, there's just--

770
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,193
you're just not allowed to die yet. Your life just
isn't your own anymore, and suddenly you've

771
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:53,046
done what you were supposed to do and now 
you're back. And it's just not yours anymore,

772
01:15:53,046 --> 01:16:04,509
is it? And what of everybody else? It's
not fair, any of it. I don't know.

773
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:08,399
TRAVIS: You don't think your life is your own?

774
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:15,291
TALIESIN: I know my life isn't my own. My life is
all of yours. My life is my sister's.

775
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:25,045
My life is this castle's. My life ended.

776
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:27,329
ASHLEY: Do you feel--

777
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:37,958
TALIESIN: I'm very glad to be here. (laughs) I
just miss an awful lot of people, that's all.

778
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:43,391
And I don't understand how we get to choose.

779
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:48,609
TRAVIS: Oh.

780
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:49,914
ASHLEY: I understand.

781
01:16:49,914 --> 01:16:51,049
TALIESIN: I know.

782
01:16:51,049 --> 01:16:52,661
TRAVIS: (whispers) I just got it too.

783
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:53,483
ASHLEY: (whispers) Yeah.

784
01:16:53,483 --> 01:17:01,532
TALIESIN: I know you don't, Grog. I'm so grateful
that you don't.

785
01:17:01,532 --> 01:17:03,687
To the unyielding unfairness of
the universe.

786
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,376
TRAVIS: Yep, raising drinks.

787
01:17:05,376 --> 01:17:07,089
LIAM: I'm not even here, and I'll drink to that
one.

788
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,225
MARISHA: I know.

789
01:17:08,225 --> 01:17:09,269
LIAM: Fucking A.

790
01:17:09,269 --> 01:17:13,119
PATRICK: I'll drink.

791
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:20,703
TALIESIN: And that it decided that we get to keep
this bastard. Hardly fair.

792
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:23,765
TRAVIS: What do we tell him when he wakes up?

793
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:26,380
TALIESIN: That's why I was thinking about going
through all of his things.

794
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,974
We could just leave him
in a gutter somewhere.

795
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:30,860
LAURA: (laughs)

796
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,101
TALIESIN: Make him think he's reincarnated a
hundred years in the future. I don't know.

797
01:17:33,101 --> 01:17:35,480
I keep thinking of terrible things 
to do to him now.

798
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,574
MARISHA: That's pretty funny.

799
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:37,482
TALIESIN: I know.

800
01:17:37,482 --> 01:17:39,507
TRAVIS: I have not explored any of that, and it is
amazing.

801
01:17:39,507 --> 01:17:41,721
TALIESIN: I-- well, we were all troubled.

802
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:47,590
I feel like once Vax is awake, we'll really 
have an expert at this sort of thing available.

803
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,239
LIAM: Now's your chance to throw something in the
acid.

804
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:52,108
(All laugh.)

805
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:57,020
TALIESIN: I wish I could hear that!

806
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,885
LIAM: Riegel's not even here.

807
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:00,820
LAURA: Oh my god.

808
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,141
LIAM: You could run roughshod over that
motherfucker.

809
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,248
TALIESIN: You're not in the room. You're not in
the room, asshole!

810
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,895
LIAM: This is Liam talking to Taliesin.

811
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:16,109
TALIESIN: I know. I don't know if Percy is that--
has that much of a lack of propriety.

812
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:20,519
He's really debating though. How much 
have we had to drink?

813
01:18:20,519 --> 01:18:23,052
MATT: Well, it's up to you. Other members in this
room have gotten quite drunk.

814
01:18:23,052 --> 01:18:28,241
MARISHA: Well, the math is always how much you've
had to drink versus distance it takes to travel to

815
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:32,464
your goal, 'cause they kinda balance each other
out.

816
01:18:32,464 --> 01:18:33,528
MATT: Yeah.

817
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:34,363
TRAVIS: That's true.

818
01:18:34,363 --> 01:18:35,269
MARISHA: The longer you have to go--

819
01:18:35,269 --> 01:18:36,716
TRAVIS: If you're stationary, that's one thing.

820
01:18:36,716 --> 01:18:46,155
MARISHA: Yeah, but, oh, I gotta go a mile? Ehh.
Half of it's down stairs? I don't know.

821
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:49,087
ASHLEY: We could play a prank on him.

822
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:54,365
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea. I think I
need somebody with a better mind for this.

823
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:56,936
TRAVIS: I walk out of the room.

824
01:18:56,936 --> 01:19:04,566
MATT: Grog leaves. Is there any other business you
guys want to conduct before the evening's done?

825
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:07,634
ASHLEY: Did you want to go through his things?

826
01:19:07,634 --> 01:19:15,677
TALIESIN: A bit. That would be cruel. Well, you're
a decent person. Should we?

827
01:19:15,677 --> 01:19:17,003
ASHLEY: Well, I mean--

828
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:25,662
PATRICK: Well, what if he happens to have
something on him that requires attention?

829
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:31,400
ASHLEY: I actually would agree, 'cause what if
there's something, you know, that he needs our

830
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,837
help with but feels weird about asking?

831
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:45,547
PATRICK: Right. Or if he has-- if there's-- well,
I was thinking like a plant that needs watering--

832
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:46,670
ASHLEY: Of course.

833
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,492
PATRICK: Except something you would have in your
pocket, which is not a plant.

834
01:19:50,492 --> 01:19:54,561
MATT: Kerr, by the way, is pretty trashed at this
point.

835
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:57,904
LIAM: Thanks for clarifying.

836
01:19:57,904 --> 01:19:59,153
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

837
01:19:59,153 --> 01:20:00,265
ASHLEY: Okay, what's your idea?

838
01:20:00,265 --> 01:20:03,703
TALIESIN: We're gonna need one of your nightgowns
and some of the pudding from downstairs kitchen.

839
01:20:03,703 --> 01:20:05,085
(all laugh)

840
01:20:05,085 --> 01:20:06,218
ASHLEY: Oh okay.

841
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,185
LIAM: Wow.

842
01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:10,190
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I go grab one of my-- I'm gonna
go grab one of my nightgowns.

843
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,140
MATT: Okay.

844
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,542
TALIESIN: I'm gonna send for some desserts from
downstairs.

845
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,358
MATT: Okay.

846
01:20:14,358 --> 01:20:16,151
MARISHA: I had nights like this in college you
guys. This is not cool.

847
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:16,957
(all laugh)

848
01:20:16,957 --> 01:20:17,931
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm well aware.

849
01:20:17,931 --> 01:20:19,012
MARISHA: This is not cool when you wake up like
this.

850
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:22,243
MATT: All right, nightgown retrieved, pudding, a
little stale but retrieved.

851
01:20:22,243 --> 01:20:23,690
TALIESIN: That's fine, stale is better.

852
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,442
MATT: Yeah.

853
01:20:24,442 --> 01:20:25,826
ASHLEY: Is my nightgown a little big on him?

854
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:28,041
(all laugh)

855
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:30,621
MATT: Actually yeah. You're a little thicker than
Scanlan. Got some--

856
01:20:30,621 --> 01:20:32,109
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ayyy!

857
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:33,509
TRAVIS: She's a monstah.

858
01:20:33,509 --> 01:20:34,489
ASHLEY: (singing) More to love.

859
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:36,758
MATT: Ain't nothing wrong with that. Ain't nothing
wrong with that.

860
01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:38,405
(all laughing)

861
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,774
ASHLEY: That's right, I got all the games.

862
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:42,318
LIAM: He's like a gnome Steve Buscemi.

863
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:43,527
(laughing continues)

864
01:20:43,527 --> 01:20:45,513
MATT: Essentially, yes.

865
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:46,953
TRAVIS: Those pythons, yo.

866
01:20:46,953 --> 01:20:48,064
MATT: You're the monster.

867
01:20:48,064 --> 01:20:50,648
All right, so you have the nightgown and 
you have the pudding, what's the plan?

868
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:52,056
ASHLEY: What are you thinking?

869
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,542
TALIESIN: Well, first we're going to have to strip
him

870
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:54,324
ASHLEY: Okay.

871
01:20:54,324 --> 01:20:55,643
TALIESIN: We're gonna put him in your nightgown.

872
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:56,842
ASHLEY: Okay.

873
01:20:56,842 --> 01:21:00,383
TALIESIN: We're gonna just, sort of leave him
hanging off the bed and decorate the entire room

874
01:21:00,383 --> 01:21:04,101
with all the desserts we've brought up and just
smear them in interesting patterns and--

875
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:05,081
ASHLEY: (gasps)

876
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:09,230
TALIESIN: Maybe some Latin everywhere. Just wonder
what happened. Let's just leave him a tableau.

877
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,083
ASHLEY: We'll have an art party.

878
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:14,988
TALIESIN: I think it's a fabulous idea.

879
01:21:14,988 --> 01:21:17,109
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll start undressing him.

880
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:26,396
MATT: All right so Kerr, you watch as Percival and
Pike begin undressing Scanlan's comatose body--

881
01:21:26,396 --> 01:21:27,417
TRAVIS: In a coma.

882
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:28,586
MATT: --and re-dressing it in a nightgown--

883
01:21:28,586 --> 01:21:29,578
LAURA: Terrible.

884
01:21:29,578 --> 01:21:35,877
MATT: --and then stage by stage, taking handfuls
of room temperature, probably day-old pudding--

885
01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:36,874
LAURA: (gasps)

886
01:21:36,874 --> 01:21:38,874
MATT: --and desserts and smearing them across the
room--

887
01:21:38,874 --> 01:21:40,142
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Eww.

888
01:21:40,142 --> 01:21:41,358
MATT: --and Scanlan himself.

889
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:42,567
TALIESIN: We're gonna braid his hair as well.

890
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:47,950
LAURA: It could be like a week before he wakes up
all moldy and nasty.

891
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:52,065
TALIESIN: I'm gonna smear in some of it on his
forehead

892
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:55,725
so he can read it in the mirror backwards
and it's just gonna say, 'no, never.'

893
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:57,720
(all laugh)

894
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,566
LIAM: With a quill? (laughing) it's a lot of
letters

895
01:22:00,566 --> 01:22:02,894
TALIESIN: Gently, gently with your-- you can fit
that.

896
01:22:02,894 --> 01:22:04,140
MATT: It's a small forehead.

897
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:04,916
LIAM: Yeah, sharpies don't exist.

898
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:10,483
TALIESIN: Oh, that's true, it is a small head.
Let's do two lines.

899
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:13,496
MARISHA: I feel like I want to do "You've got the
nightgown and you've got the pudding.

900
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:16,498
"Now what are you gonna do?" 
in cross stitch on my wall.

901
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,714
LAURA: (laughs)

902
01:22:17,714 --> 01:22:22,831
MATT: All righty. So, you complete your art
project.

903
01:22:22,831 --> 01:22:26,544
MATT: Take it however you feel, witnessing the
event Kerrek--

904
01:22:26,544 --> 01:22:29,861
PATRICK: Actually, Kerr, at some point, is
probably like,

905
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:34,879
If you got some ribbons, get his hands.

906
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:35,889
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

907
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:38,080
(all laugh)

908
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,047
TRAVIS: I'm shocked.

909
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:40,063
PATRICK: On the bedpost.

910
01:22:40,063 --> 01:22:41,100
TRAVIS: I'm shocked.

911
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,515
TALIESIN: You, sir, are a man of the world. What a
great idea.

912
01:22:43,515 --> 01:22:46,204
(all laugh)

913
01:22:46,204 --> 01:22:48,552
TRAVIS: A man of the world.

914
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:51,415
TALIESIN: I'm going to retrieve two of my scarves
from my room.

915
01:22:51,415 --> 01:22:52,524
(all laugh)

916
01:22:52,524 --> 01:22:53,704
MATT: Okay.

917
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:54,655
LIAM: Yes, yes.

918
01:22:54,655 --> 01:22:58,147
TALIESIN: With two of-- of the-- uh, yeah.

919
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:00,315
MATT: (laughs) That's perfect.

920
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:01,700
TALIESIN: Couple of neck scarves.

921
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,019
MATT: Great, okay.

922
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:04,296
PATRICK: Not too tight.

923
01:23:04,296 --> 01:23:05,046
TALIESIN: Not too tight.

924
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:05,656
PATRICK: Not too tight.

925
01:23:05,656 --> 01:23:06,914
TALIESIN: Gentle. (laughs)

926
01:23:06,914 --> 01:23:09,539
PATRICK: No, no that's not that sort of knot.

927
01:23:09,539 --> 01:23:11,011
MATT: (laughs)

928
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:17,808
PATRICK: You have to wrap it around and then
through.

929
01:23:17,808 --> 01:23:21,254
MATT: You unintentionally learn more about
Kerrek's history than you expected to.

930
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:24,110
TALIESIN: I really I feel like I'm getting so many
more chapters.

931
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:26,442
LIAM: So very Vox Machina.

932
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:35,941
MATT: All right, and with the presentation
complete, your diorama con Scanlan, the evening

933
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:40,664
draws late. It is now probably a good 2:30, 3
o'clock in the morning upon completion.

934
01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:41,515
MARISHA: Oh, oh shit.

935
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:43,157
TALIESIN: It is time for sleep.

936
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:45,198
LAURA: Did I ever get a message?

937
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:46,970
MATT: Yeah, we're gonna get to that right now.

938
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:52,306
You did get a message from Allura that tells you 
that the ritual is successful. Scanlan is alive.

939
01:23:52,306 --> 01:23:54,791
LAURA: (excited noise)

940
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,445
MATT: Yes?

941
01:23:55,445 --> 01:23:58,989
LAURA: I wake Trinket up. He's alive!

942
01:23:58,989 --> 01:23:59,962
MATT: (confused bear noises)

943
01:23:59,962 --> 01:24:01,101
LAURA: He's alive!

944
01:24:01,101 --> 01:24:02,381
And I go running out of the room.

945
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:03,468
He's alive!

946
01:24:03,468 --> 01:24:05,047
to the entire
bar down below.

947
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:05,874
MATT: Trinket rushes out after you.

948
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,338
"(aggressive bear noises)"

949
01:24:07,338 --> 01:24:08,181
TRAVIS: (laughs)

950
01:24:08,181 --> 01:24:11,321
LAURA: It worked! It worked! Who's awake!? Anyone?
Is anyone awake?

951
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:16,408
MATT: You-- (laughs) you look down and there's
maybe three people in the open expanse of the

952
01:24:16,408 --> 01:24:23,681
tavern floor, two of which are passed out on
tables, one of them in their own vomit and there

953
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:30,014
is-- the door to the tavern is still open and the
one barkeep is somebody else has taken on the

954
01:24:30,014 --> 01:24:34,315
night shift, who's currently just sitting back and
reading a book. Just kinda looks up at you,

955
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:36,046
"Shhhhh."

956
01:24:36,046 --> 01:24:37,410
LAURA: You!

957
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,446
MATT: What?

958
01:24:38,446 --> 01:24:40,014
LAURA: I'm buying you a drink!

959
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:41,212
(all laugh)

960
01:24:41,212 --> 01:24:43,799
LAURA: I come running downstairs and keep
drinking.

961
01:24:43,799 --> 01:24:49,128
MATT: Okay, you approach the gentleman, who-- you
know, receding hairline, short, kind of salt and

962
01:24:49,128 --> 01:24:55,793
pepper hair, bit of a double chin going on. A
portly fella in his probably late forties or so,

963
01:24:55,793 --> 01:25:00,464
kinda square spectacles at the tip of his nose
with his book he sits down to the side.

964
01:25:00,464 --> 01:25:05,975
He's wearing just a simple tunic with a little bit
of an apron on.

965
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:09,896
"Um, uh (sputtering) sure, I uh, I suppose."

966
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,067
LAURA: Yeah.

967
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:16,994
MATT: Alright, um, I'll pour my drink.

968
01:25:16,994 --> 01:25:19,912
LAURA: What's the best thing you've got? That's,
you know, within reason?

969
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:24,082
(all laugh)

970
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:28,003
MATT: "That'll be the Supple Wake, um--"

971
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:34,693
And he pulls this dark red, terracotta jug from 
underneath and it has a wax seal on the

972
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:38,585
top of it that's kind of currently
closed off and he,

973
01:25:38,585 --> 01:25:44,353
"This'll run you about uh, 20 gold for
the bottle. It's the best we have."

974
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:49,740
LAURA: I'm in! Let's do it! and then pour a bowl
of ale for my bear here.

975
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,332
MATT: He looks over and he just sees like,
lumbering across the room--

976
01:25:53,332 --> 01:25:55,728
He didn't notice at the time, just kinda 
transfixed by your sudden strangeness.

977
01:25:55,728 --> 01:25:57,935
LAURA: Cause he was in my necklace
earlier when I came in.

978
01:25:57,935 --> 01:25:59,858
MATT: Yeah. Suddenly there's a giant bear
(crashing noises) and he goes,

979
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:05,642
"Um... okay. (nervous laughter)" (sound of the
bottle being popped open)

980
01:26:05,642 --> 01:26:09,459
MATT: And just goes ahead and fills three 
small glasses--

981
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:10,736
LIAM: He's on a different layer.

982
01:26:10,736 --> 01:26:11,548
MATT: --passes them over--

983
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:12,900
LIAM: A whole new sound effect.

984
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,654
MATT: --and puts over into a bowl and kinda sets
it onto the edge and Trinket kinda pulls and grabs

985
01:26:15,654 --> 01:26:18,058
the edge of the bowl with a big claw and it tips
over and kinda splashes--

986
01:26:18,058 --> 01:26:19,108
LAURA: Yeah.

987
01:26:19,108 --> 01:26:20,825
MATT: --and as Trinket's face is (licking noises).

988
01:26:20,825 --> 01:26:22,937
LAURA: Drink up, buddy. That's some expensive
shit.

989
01:26:22,937 --> 01:26:26,929
MATT: Gets up on the top. Gets both arms up on the
actual bar and is kinda like crushing the wood a

990
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:31,128
little bit and knocked the bowl over and
it's spilled out and he's like (slurping) and the

991
01:26:31,128 --> 01:26:36,393
guy's just sitting back leaning further and
further away, grabs his glass...

992
01:26:36,393 --> 01:26:38,109
LAURA: Cheers!

993
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:41,009
LAURA: What a great night! Ha! (drinking sound)

994
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:42,486
MATT: --to the night shift"

995
01:26:42,486 --> 01:26:46,982
(all laugh)

996
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:50,667
MATT: All right--

997
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:53,811
LIAM: We've been playing this game three years.
You wait three years to pull out that brand new

998
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:56,399
sound effect of a cork (popping sound) coming out
of a bottle.

999
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:57,405
LAURA: I know, right!?

1000
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:59,093
MATT: I don't know! I spent a lot of time alone as
a kid. (laughs)

1001
01:26:59,093 --> 01:27:01,019
LIAM: Wow, wow.

1002
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:02,770
MARISHA: We've been playing this game for like
five years.

1003
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:03,776
LAURA: Yeah, god, five years!

1004
01:27:03,776 --> 01:27:05,323
ASHLEY: Five years.

1005
01:27:05,323 --> 01:27:08,440
MARISHA: This is like two and then-- two and a
half, four and a half, I think.

1006
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,449
LIAM: Yeah, we started back in nineteen aught
five, right?

1007
01:27:10,449 --> 01:27:12,071
TRAVIS and LAURA: (old-timey voices) Nineteen
aught five!

1008
01:27:12,071 --> 01:27:14,977
MARISHA: It was spring break, Cancun.

1009
01:27:14,977 --> 01:27:16,444
MATT: (dudebro voice) Spring break!

1010
01:27:16,513 --> 01:27:18,601
(all laugh)

1011
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:28,207
MATT: So, evening comes full circle, rest comes
about, the next day, presents you with rest,

1012
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:39,011
comfort. You're healful, you've restored your hit
points, you get back half of your hit dice. Also,

1013
01:27:39,011 --> 01:27:42,195
bright and early, as you all begin to kinda rouse
from your slumber and wake up, Scanlan still

1014
01:27:42,195 --> 01:27:52,426
asleep, still covered in the mess that you left
him in. And shortly into the morning there is a

1015
01:27:52,426 --> 01:27:58,075
series of quick (pounding sounds) footsteps up
from the lower regions of the castle as Vex'ahlia

1016
01:27:58,075 --> 01:28:02,747
arrives, freshly transported by Eskil Ryndarien to
Whitestone.

1017
01:28:02,747 --> 01:28:04,281
LAURA: (laughs)

1018
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:08,067
MATT: So as you rush in, you can see everybody
kind of slightly groggily having their breakfast

1019
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:10,782
in the main eating hall of Whitestone castle.

1020
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:13,164
LAURA: (gasp) Where is he? Where is he?

1021
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:14,992
TRAVIS: Oh no, he's still asleep.

1022
01:28:14,992 --> 01:28:17,341
TALIESIN: He's still sleeping it off.

1023
01:28:17,341 --> 01:28:18,380
LAURA: Oh.

1024
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,167
TALIESIN: I don't think he's actually like woken
up yet.

1025
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,517
LAURA: Oh, oh! It takes a lot out of you.

1026
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:24,123
TALIESIN: It does, yes.

1027
01:28:24,123 --> 01:28:26,328
LAURA: How's everyone? Are you good? How'd it go?

1028
01:28:26,328 --> 01:28:27,766
ASHLEY: Good, good good good good.

1029
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:28,706
TALIESIN: Good.

1030
01:28:28,706 --> 01:28:30,343
LAURA: (relieved sigh) I was so worried.

1031
01:28:30,343 --> 01:28:31,406
ASHLEY: I'm so glad you're back.

1032
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,317
LAURA: I'm so glad to be here.

1033
01:28:32,317 --> 01:28:34,988
MARISHA: How was your night? Where are-- did you--
how was it? How was that town?

1034
01:28:34,988 --> 01:28:36,529
LAURA: The town.

1035
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:37,849
MARISHA: Yeah?

1036
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:39,685
LAURA: You know, I didn't see much of it.

1037
01:28:39,685 --> 01:28:40,312
MARISHA: No?

1038
01:28:40,312 --> 01:28:41,026
LAURA: Outside of a bar.

1039
01:28:41,026 --> 01:28:42,046
MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah.

1040
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:45,426
LAURA: Yeah, me and Eskil had some times though, I
can tell you.

1041
01:28:45,426 --> 01:28:48,260
MARISHA: Really!? I never pegged him for like--

1042
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,734
LAURA: That guy is a partier.

1043
01:28:49,734 --> 01:28:51,636
MARISHA: No way! What!?

1044
01:28:51,636 --> 01:28:52,403
LAURA: Oh yeah.

1045
01:28:52,403 --> 01:28:53,406
TALIESIN: Fascinating to know.

1046
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:54,752
MARISHA: Shut up.

1047
01:28:54,752 --> 01:28:56,557
LAURA: He put some moves on me, Percy. You should
be aware.

1048
01:28:56,557 --> 01:28:57,907
TALIESIN: Really? Really?

1049
01:28:57,907 --> 01:28:58,567
MARISHA: (shocked gasp)

1050
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:01,589
MATT: At which point, you turn around in the room
and you see Eskil entering

1051
01:29:01,589 --> 01:29:08,451
with his little walking stick like 
(back cracking noises) (old man groan).

1052
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:14,035
MARISHA: Eskil, you devil. You little pit fiend,
you! Look at you!

1053
01:29:14,035 --> 01:29:16,306
TALIESIN: Such impropriety.

1054
01:29:16,306 --> 01:29:20,046
MATT: I'll take my meal in my room.

1055
01:29:20,046 --> 01:29:21,227
LAURA: Thanks again darling! It was wonderful.

1056
01:29:21,227 --> 01:29:23,078
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh, he's having a hangover
meal.

1057
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:26,394
TRAVIS: You gave him back problems?

1058
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:27,894
MATT: "... good day."

1059
01:29:27,894 --> 01:29:29,901
(all laugh)

1060
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:37,588
MATT: He slowly turns around. "Where is my
manservant?" and he wanders off into the castle.

1061
01:29:37,588 --> 01:29:39,644
LAURA: So what are we doing today?

1062
01:29:39,644 --> 01:29:45,759
MARISHA: (sigh) Well, I guess, I mean we-- I know
Allura's going back to Emon to check in on things

1063
01:29:45,759 --> 01:29:51,612
since we kind of left in a hurry but, I guess we
should wait for Scanlan to wake up.

1064
01:29:51,612 --> 01:29:56,300
TALIESIN: Well... there are things to do I
suppose.

1065
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,132
There's still a list of things that need
to be taken care of.

1066
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:02,269
TRAVIS: Yeah 
And I suppose we really shouldn't rush Scanlan,

1067
01:30:02,269 --> 01:30:05,216
I mean, we might be able to do some of those.

1068
01:30:05,216 --> 01:30:07,498
ASHLEY: Sleep is the best medicine!

1069
01:30:07,498 --> 01:30:08,790
TRAVIS: It is?

1070
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,668
ASHLEY: Some people say that.

1071
01:30:10,668 --> 01:30:12,984
(all laugh)

1072
01:30:12,984 --> 01:30:19,503
ASHLEY: Although real medicine is a little better 
but just really for rejuvenation and...

1073
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:21,226
What are we doing?

1074
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:22,610
(all laugh)

1075
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:27,379
MATT: Pike, holistic cleric.

1076
01:30:27,379 --> 01:30:30,049
TRAVIS: Pretty much anything is good.

1077
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:33,142
MATT: Kerrek now wanders in very hungover

1078
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:35,173
TALIESIN: Good morning.

1079
01:30:35,173 --> 01:30:38,482
PATRICK: Yeah, very... yeah.

1080
01:30:38,482 --> 01:30:39,826
(all laugh)

1081
01:30:39,826 --> 01:30:43,665
I look every bit as old as I am

1082
01:30:43,665 --> 01:30:45,738
TRAVIS: Yeaaah, swamp ass!

1083
01:30:45,738 --> 01:30:46,769
(all laugh)

1084
01:30:46,769 --> 01:30:48,812
ASHLEY: Aaaaay!

1085
01:30:48,812 --> 01:30:53,181
ASHLEY: I remember, I remember it

1086
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:53,951
LAURA: Swamp ass?

1087
01:30:53,951 --> 01:30:55,580
TALIESIN: I don't remember, what?

1088
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,798
ASHLEY: He was talking about his butt getting
sweaty.

1089
01:30:57,798 --> 01:31:00,583
TALIESIN: Oh... 
Ah, the night got weird.

1090
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:03,914
ASHLEY: We all agreed it happens!

1091
01:31:03,914 --> 01:31:08,636
LIAM: (clicks tongue) Uh, I'm actually not here.
I never left the temple.

1092
01:31:08,636 --> 01:31:09,606
LAURA: Oh!

1093
01:31:09,606 --> 01:31:10,877
MATT: Stayed there overnight?

1094
01:31:10,877 --> 01:31:13,010
LIAM: Ah, yes I did. And we'll have a flashback
now.

1095
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,114
MATT: Okay!

1096
01:31:14,114 --> 01:31:15,602
LIAM: Super quick! Super quick.

1097
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:17,882
LAURA and ASHLEY: (make "flashback" sounds)

1098
01:31:17,882 --> 01:31:20,567
MATT: (with a "narrator" voice) Where is Vax?
(whooshing sounds)

1099
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:28,586
LIAM: Fucking exhausted. Set down everything that
I own on the altar, and took ten minutes to take

1100
01:31:28,586 --> 01:31:32,891
off all the armor and lay that out on the altar
and just, uh--

1101
01:31:32,891 --> 01:31:35,299
LAURA: (unwrapping a candy loudly)

1102
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:38,093
LIAM: Get your candies unwrapped, grandmas. 
(laughs)

1103
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:45,645
And I just stare at it. For a long time
wondering,

1104
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:49,965
What happens now?

1105
01:31:49,965 --> 01:31:53,832
That's it. And then I stay there for the whole
night.

1106
01:31:53,832 --> 01:31:55,799
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys continue breakfast--

1107
01:31:55,799 --> 01:31:58,228
LAURA and LIAM: ("flashback" whooshing sounds)

1108
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:02,321
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. And you arrive and catch up
with everybody and your brother's not there.

1109
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:03,918
LAURA: (with her mouth full of candy) Where's
Vax?!

1110
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,069
TRAVIS: Your brother's not here

1111
01:32:05,069 --> 01:32:06,277
LAURA: Where is he?

1112
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:11,084
ASHLEY: He stayed in the Raven Queen's temple? 
I know that.

1113
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:12,425
LAURA: He stayed in the temple?!

1114
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:14,824
ASHLEY: I think he did. I-- I don't know, I was up
in the room that I--

1115
01:32:14,824 --> 01:32:16,190
TRAVIS: That's where we saw him last.

1116
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:18,839
ASHLEY: He stayed there when we left, so he could
still be there? I'm not sure.

1117
01:32:18,839 --> 01:32:21,953
MARISHA: He didn't come back last night, so... I'm
assuming he stayed there.

1118
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,863
LAURA: Well, I'm, gonna go find him! I give Percy
a kiss on the head as I walk by.

1119
01:32:24,863 --> 01:32:26,534
It's good to see you again.

1120
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:28,675
TALIESIN: It's good to see you too. Welcome home!

1121
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:30,444
LAURA: Glad you're alive.

1122
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:32,295
TALIESIN: (laughs) Very glad to be alive.

1123
01:32:32,295 --> 01:32:34,093
LAURA: Where's my brother?

1124
01:32:34,093 --> 01:32:36,386
(all laugh)

1125
01:32:36,386 --> 01:32:38,281
MARISHA: She's in a really good mood.

1126
01:32:38,281 --> 01:32:40,581
TALIESIN: Yes, she is.

1127
01:32:40,581 --> 01:32:42,986
TRAVIS: Maybe you should hit up Eskil for some
tricks.

1128
01:32:42,986 --> 01:32:44,752
MARISHA: I know!

1129
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:46,195
TALIESIN: I think that might be fun!

1130
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:47,628
(all laugh)

1131
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:52,076
MARISHA: I didn't know you guys had that kind of
relationship.

1132
01:32:52,076 --> 01:32:56,896
TALIESIN: The girth of things you do not know
could fill such a cavern.

1133
01:32:56,896 --> 01:32:58,751
MARISHA: (laughs) You said "girth".

1134
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:03,867
TALIESIN: I did. Ah, I love you. I'm so proud 
of you.

1135
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:08,973
MATT: The bad influence of Vox Machina.

1136
01:33:08,973 --> 01:33:10,861
MARISHA: Vex taught me that was funny!

1137
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:14,808
(all laugh)

1138
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:17,745
TALIESIN: Wow, thank you, I didn't need that.

1139
01:33:17,745 --> 01:33:25,801
MATT: Vax. After a long night of meditation on
your place between the mortal realm and divine,

1140
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:33,648
the ramifications or meaning behind the choices in
allowance that destiny still lays unfulfilled, to

1141
01:33:33,648 --> 01:33:42,924
have not felt intervention against the return of
the spirits of those you've lost weighs a bit on

1142
01:33:42,924 --> 01:33:56,829
you. The idea that to not allow a thread to be 
severed means there's still a plan. And that

1143
01:33:56,829 --> 01:34:02,499
worries you. Because that means, in what little 
scope you have, you don't see that there's still

1144
01:34:02,499 --> 01:34:11,502
more work to be done, at least as far as she's 
concerned. As tonight you've had nothing but

1145
01:34:11,502 --> 01:34:19,319
silence within the temple. 
And then (slams) the door slams open, the bright

1146
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:23,623
light of the morning just (swooshes) across you as
you're on the altar, and there you see,

1147
01:34:23,623 --> 01:34:28,175
silhouetted in the light, the outline of your
sister.

1148
01:34:28,175 --> 01:34:34,976
LAURA: What are you doing!? Trinket, stay outside,
it's holy in here.

1149
01:34:34,976 --> 01:34:37,040
LIAM: Don't come in here, Trinket, I'm naked!

1150
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,383
MATT: (Trinket groans)

1151
01:34:38,383 --> 01:34:42,319
LAURA: Oh. Well. I walk in blindly, one hand in
front of me.

1152
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:46,274
Are you really naked or are you just
saying that? Where are you?

1153
01:34:46,274 --> 01:34:48,287
LIAM: I stand up and let my dinglies dangle.

1154
01:34:48,287 --> 01:34:49,132
LAURA: No!

1155
01:34:49,132 --> 01:34:50,801
(all laugh)

1156
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:51,670
LAURA: Hey!

1157
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:53,133
LIAM: Yeah?

1158
01:34:53,133 --> 01:34:55,502
LAURA: I heard he's alive!

1159
01:34:55,502 --> 01:34:56,183
LIAM: Yeah.

1160
01:34:56,183 --> 01:34:59,385
LAURA: That's pretty great, right?

1161
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:02,001
I turn my back to him so I can open my damn eyes.

1162
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:03,189
MATT: Okay.

1163
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:04,843
LAURA: What are you doing sleeping in here?!

1164
01:35:04,843 --> 01:35:06,137
LIAM: I give her a naked hug from behind.

1165
01:35:06,137 --> 01:35:09,940
LAURA: Ahh, creepy! Get off! Fucking gross!

1166
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:12,464
LIAM: (laughs) Oh, we used to take baths together.

1167
01:35:12,464 --> 01:35:16,834
(all laugh)

1168
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:18,877
LIAM: What? What's that funny?

1169
01:35:18,877 --> 01:35:22,164
LAURA: Nothing! Nothing!

1170
01:35:22,164 --> 01:35:23,484
LIAM: Ah, he is, he is.

1171
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:26,310
And I back off.

1172
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,634
He's good.

1173
01:35:27,634 --> 01:35:30,323
LAURA: (still laughing) Yeah...

1174
01:35:30,323 --> 01:35:32,502
LIAM: You missed quite a performance, actually.

1175
01:35:32,502 --> 01:35:35,129
LAURA: Oh, really? By whom?

1176
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:40,004
LIAM: The younger Shorthalt.

1177
01:35:40,004 --> 01:35:43,061
LAURA: So she did contribute.

1178
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:46,175
LIAM: Oh, yes.

1179
01:35:46,175 --> 01:35:49,291
LAURA: Thank God that trip wasn't
for nothing.

1180
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:55,744
LIAM: I start to put on my sort of Mormon unibody
underwear thing.

1181
01:35:55,744 --> 01:36:00,467
Uh. So that's done, then.

1182
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:02,030
LAURA: What's done? What?

1183
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:04,127
LIAM: Dragons!

1184
01:36:04,127 --> 01:36:07,330
LAURA: I mean... Can I turn around?

1185
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:09,636
LIAM: Uh... Yeah, I've covered.

1186
01:36:09,636 --> 01:36:10,764
LAURA: Okay.

1187
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:11,929
LIAM: The glory.

1188
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:14,748
(both laugh)

1189
01:36:14,748 --> 01:36:17,509
LAURA: I mean, I think so? Right?

1190
01:36:17,509 --> 01:36:18,382
LIAM: Yeah.

1191
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:22,440
LAURA: I don't know what she was up to, but--
What were you doing here! Why are you sleeping in

1192
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:27,126
this cold, creepy temple when everyone else 
is celebrating?

1193
01:36:27,126 --> 01:36:29,843
LIAM: You encouraged me to embrace all this when I
was complaining about--

1194
01:36:29,843 --> 01:36:33,844
LAURA: Oh, well, yes, of course. Not to the
detriment of your happiness.

1195
01:36:33,844 --> 01:36:38,293
LIAM: (laughs) I'm happy. Ish.

1196
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,599
LAURA: Ish?

1197
01:36:41,599 --> 01:36:44,516
LIAM: What happens now?

1198
01:36:44,516 --> 01:36:52,054
LAURA: Now that dragons are defeated and all of
Tal'Dorei can live in peace and harmony and Vox

1199
01:36:52,054 --> 01:36:56,496
Machina, the heroes that everyone was searching
for...

1200
01:36:56,496 --> 01:36:59,334
LIAM: (laughs) You're staying here?

1201
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:03,296
LAURA: Staying where? Here? Here in this temple?
Here in Whitestone? I know what you're talking

1202
01:37:03,296 --> 01:37:07,361
about. I mean, I do have a keep here. Right, a
castle? A home.

1203
01:37:07,361 --> 01:37:09,855
LIAM: A husk.

1204
01:37:09,855 --> 01:37:11,317
LAURA: I also have money.

1205
01:37:11,317 --> 01:37:12,016
LIAM: Yeah.

1206
01:37:12,016 --> 01:37:20,246
LAURA: I can build. What're you gonna do? 
Would you stay?

1207
01:37:20,246 --> 01:37:22,035
LIAM: Here?

1208
01:37:22,035 --> 01:37:25,670
LAURA: You have a temple!

1209
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:31,541
LIAM: I know. I like it! I slept in it.

1210
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:32,418
(both laugh)

1211
01:37:32,418 --> 01:37:34,998
LAURA: You know, I can get some lush pillows put
in here as well.

1212
01:37:34,998 --> 01:37:39,754
This is on my property after all! (laughs)

1213
01:37:39,754 --> 01:37:48,404
LIAM: No, I was thinking... I mean, I don't know what 
any of us are doing, but I was thinking that I might

1214
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:55,062
go back with Keyleth. For a while.

1215
01:37:55,062 --> 01:38:00,227
LAURA: Right! Well, of course!

1216
01:38:00,227 --> 01:38:06,380
LIAM: I mean, you're set, you're-- This is your
home, now

1217
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:11,247
LAURA: I mean, one of--

1218
01:38:11,247 --> 01:38:22,783
LIAM: I don't mean the place, or the building...
You know what I mean.

1219
01:38:22,783 --> 01:38:29,388
LAURA: I mean, it's-- Hasn't been very long,
dear, who knows what's gonna happen?

1220
01:38:29,388 --> 01:38:30,526
LIAM: Sure.

1221
01:38:30,526 --> 01:38:31,485
LAURA: Sure?

1222
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:33,276
LIAM: Sure.

1223
01:38:33,276 --> 01:38:36,394
LAURA: Would you like me to travel with you and
Keyleth?

1224
01:38:36,394 --> 01:38:44,202
LIAM: I would never turn you away. But I think 
that you have activities to explore here...

1225
01:38:44,202 --> 01:38:50,906
But no, I mean, you're my heart, you're me, you're
my other half, you're welcome with me always.

1226
01:38:50,906 --> 01:38:54,478
LAURA: (distressed) Why are we talking about
this!? Don't talk about this now!

1227
01:38:54,478 --> 01:39:06,359
This is a time of happiness, don't talk about 
sad things! Please... Please?

1228
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:07,077
LIAM: I am happy.

1229
01:39:07,077 --> 01:39:08,687
LAURA: Good!

1230
01:39:08,687 --> 01:39:11,766
LIAM: Happiest I've been in a long time. Long
time.

1231
01:39:11,766 --> 01:39:14,134
LAURA: Good. Come.

1232
01:39:14,134 --> 01:39:14,785
LIAM: Yeah!

1233
01:39:14,785 --> 01:39:15,563
LAURA: All right!

1234
01:39:15,563 --> 01:39:17,462
LIAM: Well, you know, I'm in my undies, so...

1235
01:39:17,462 --> 01:39:18,552
LAURA: Well! Put your armor on--

1236
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,089
LIAM: Why don't you go and I'll catch up-- That
takes like 22 minutes, though!

1237
01:39:21,089 --> 01:39:22,556
LAURA: Well, what if I help you!

1238
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:24,196
LIAM: All right.

1239
01:39:24,196 --> 01:39:24,947
LAURA: Done it before.

1240
01:39:24,947 --> 01:39:25,643
LIAM: Yeah

1241
01:39:25,643 --> 01:39:28,119
LAURA: Ten minutes, then, right? Go get some breakfast, after all.

1242
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:32,499
LIAM: Yeah.

1243
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:33,844
MARISHA: Dress sequence!

1244
01:39:33,844 --> 01:39:34,882
TALIESIN: And that's how you put on armor.

1245
01:39:34,882 --> 01:39:37,247
(all laugh)

1246
01:39:37,247 --> 01:39:42,189
MATT: Alright. As you guys head back, you all
gather at this point in time.

1247
01:39:42,189 --> 01:39:46,960
Allura and Kima have woken and met up with you, 
begin to make arrangements and telling you to

1248
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:54,354
gather your things if you're going to journey with 
them to Emon to find your way there.

1249
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:57,592
You guys have everything you need?

1250
01:39:57,592 --> 01:40:04,104
TRAVIS: Uh, yes.

1251
01:40:04,104 --> 01:40:06,373
LAURA: I mean we're all healed, everything's
great?

1252
01:40:06,373 --> 01:40:08,183
MATT: Yeah, you all had a night's rest.

1253
01:40:08,183 --> 01:40:10,788
LAURA: What are we gonna do, we're bringing 
Scanlan with us?

1254
01:40:10,788 --> 01:40:11,495
LIAM: No.

1255
01:40:11,495 --> 01:40:12,618
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

1256
01:40:12,618 --> 01:40:13,383
LAURA: Scanlan's gonna stay here?

1257
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:14,074
TRAVIS: Yes!

1258
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:14,725
LAURA: Alone?

1259
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:15,647
TRAVIS: Yes!

1260
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:17,370
TALIESIN: He's got nurses.

1261
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:23,465
MATT:  Well, not alone, we can have Keeper Yennen
watch over him, we have a number of guard

1262
01:40:23,465 --> 01:40:31,554
here, and soon as any word comes to his rousing we
will make sure that it's sent to us.

1263
01:40:31,554 --> 01:40:33,592
LIAM: Pike, how's he looking?

1264
01:40:33,592 --> 01:40:37,700
PATRICK: Someone should probably roll him over and
change his knots (snickers).

1265
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,558
LAURA: Oh that's true. I mean I wasn't there, I
don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1266
01:40:40,558 --> 01:40:43,639
(all laugh)

1267
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:44,890
LAURA: What knots?

1268
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:48,215
TALIESIN: The nurses were given some instructions.

1269
01:40:48,215 --> 01:40:52,216
PATRICK: Actually he's just nodding, just laughing
to himself, he just can't talk about anything.

1270
01:40:52,216 --> 01:40:55,793
MATT: As his laughter begins to build, a second
set of laughter gets to join in,

1271
01:40:55,793 --> 01:41:05,927
as you see coming around the corner, laughing a
still drunk, not slept, Kaylie...

1272
01:41:05,927 --> 01:41:06,897
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1273
01:41:06,897 --> 01:41:10,021
MATT: --comes with circles in her eyes, just goes,

1274
01:41:10,021 --> 01:41:13,748
"Heh, well, that there's some fancy work, whoever
did that".

1275
01:41:13,748 --> 01:41:16,850
TRAVIS: Oh shit, she saw the room.

1276
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:21,766
MATT: That's choice! (laughs)

1277
01:41:21,766 --> 01:41:24,252
TALIESIN: You're welcome, dear. Seemed the least
we could do.

1278
01:41:24,252 --> 01:41:28,055
ASHLEY: Figured it was appropriate when he woke
up, that he would--

1279
01:41:28,055 --> 01:41:29,501
LAURA: What did you do?

1280
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,349
ASHLEY: Not anything--

1281
01:41:31,349 --> 01:41:35,716
MATT: Knot, exactly! Knot! A few knots.

1282
01:41:35,716 --> 01:41:38,821
PATRICK: I think we should, those arms will be 
asleep,

1283
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:40,718
there's gonna be a problem up there if we don't--

1284
01:41:40,718 --> 01:41:46,442
(all laugh)

1285
01:41:46,442 --> 01:41:48,438
MATT: You know what, I'll stay here, I'll watch
over him,

1286
01:41:48,438 --> 01:41:55,132
I'll make sure the knots are changed in
time. I kinda wanna be here to see his face.

1287
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:57,949
LIAM: Did he break a leg or something?

1288
01:41:57,949 --> 01:42:01,885
ASHLEY: No, he just-- we wanted to make sure he
stayed-- that he didn't--

1289
01:42:01,885 --> 01:42:02,905
MATT: Comfortable!

1290
01:42:02,905 --> 01:42:04,267
ASHLEY: --didn't roll off the bed.

1291
01:42:04,267 --> 01:42:05,588
MATT: Make sure he stays comfortable.

1292
01:42:05,588 --> 01:42:06,844
ASHLEY: Keep him there.

1293
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:07,748
LIAM: All right.

1294
01:42:07,748 --> 01:42:09,493
LAURA: All right.

1295
01:42:09,493 --> 01:42:10,661
LIAM: (whispers) I feel like we're missing
something.

1296
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:12,673
TALIESIN: Keeping him in the manner in which he is
comfortable. (laughs)

1297
01:42:12,673 --> 01:42:14,506
ASHLEY: Yes.

1298
01:42:14,506 --> 01:42:15,963
LAURA: How are you doing, Kaylie?

1299
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,000
MATT: I'm fine.

1300
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,153
LAURA: You look great.

1301
01:42:18,153 --> 01:42:20,952
MATT: "I'm sure I do."

1302
01:42:20,952 --> 01:42:27,567
Her hair is kind of all clustered to one side 
now, and you can see the stains on her shirt,

1303
01:42:27,567 --> 01:42:32,507
but she still looks like she could probably take 
somebody in a bar-fight. You can definitely see

1304
01:42:32,507 --> 01:42:39,380
in this moment more than anything,
she is of Shorthalt stock.

1305
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,636
"Well, go on! Do your thing."

1306
01:42:42,636 --> 01:42:46,207
TRAVIS: You're sure? You'll be all right here? I'm
sure Percy can let you have whatever you

1307
01:42:46,207 --> 01:42:49,068
want, right, Percy? Just anything she wants.

1308
01:42:49,068 --> 01:42:51,051
TALIESIN: No. But if you do need a room--

1309
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:52,306
(all laugh)

1310
01:42:52,306 --> 01:42:57,473
TALIESIN: --and some drink, we definitely have
that available. And the appropriate authorities

1311
01:42:57,473 --> 01:43:03,780
have already been-- why are you all
looking at me like that?

1312
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:07,961
TRAVIS: Do I need to remind you of the title you
gave me? Surely I hold some power in--

1313
01:43:07,961 --> 01:43:09,481
TALIESIN: It does.

1314
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:11,318
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, ooh, I wrote that title down.

1315
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:13,054
LIAM: Yes, of all of this and that? The Doinka
Doink?

1316
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:15,036
MARISHA: Grand Poobah?

1317
01:43:15,036 --> 01:43:18,370
TRAVIS: It doesn't really matter, I'm just saying,
if she needs something while we're gone--

1318
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,013
MARISHA: This is very important--

1319
01:43:20,013 --> 01:43:22,700
TALIESIN: Don't hesitate to ask if you do need
anything.

1320
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:25,368
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I have decreed it.

1321
01:43:25,368 --> 01:43:29,432
MATT: Well, I shall certainly ask. And I will
need everything.

1322
01:43:29,432 --> 01:43:32,589
TALIESIN: I am powerfully aware.

1323
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:34,897
MATT: Kind of rushes past you and sits down and
starts eating

1324
01:43:34,897 --> 01:43:37,203
the leftovers of whatever dish was
not finished.

1325
01:43:37,203 --> 01:43:40,487
MARISHA: Grand Poobah de Boink is the title.

1326
01:43:40,552 --> 01:43:42,222
LIAM: Of all this and that.

1327
01:43:42,222 --> 01:43:43,056
MARISHA: I wrote it down.

1328
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:44,235
LAURA: Of all this and that.

1329
01:43:44,235 --> 01:43:47,619
MARISHA: Of all, yes, "In Charge of All Of This
And That".

1330
01:43:47,619 --> 01:43:50,540
TRAVIS: That was the proper title.

1331
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:51,665
(all laugh)

1332
01:43:51,665 --> 01:43:58,293
MATT:  I need to add that to the Campaign Guide. I
need to do that.

1333
01:43:58,293 --> 01:44:00,172
ASHLEY: Grand, what is it? Grand Poobah..?

1334
01:44:00,172 --> 01:44:01,598
TALIESIN: Poobah!

1335
01:44:01,598 --> 01:44:02,311
MARISHA: de Boink.

1336
01:44:02,311 --> 01:44:03,311
TALIESIN: de Boink.

1337
01:44:03,311 --> 01:44:04,048
MATT: de Boink.

1338
01:44:04,048 --> 01:44:06,116
MARISHA: Like Des Moines, but de Boink.

1339
01:44:06,116 --> 01:44:07,444
LIAM: Of the Vermont de Boinks?

1340
01:44:07,444 --> 01:44:09,128
MARISHA: Of the Vermont de Boinks.

1341
01:44:09,128 --> 01:44:11,302
TALIESIN: Steady are the winds caused by the farts
of kings.

1342
01:44:11,302 --> 01:44:13,922
(all laugh)

1343
01:44:13,922 --> 01:44:15,014
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1344
01:44:15,014 --> 01:44:16,239
ASHLEY: That is adorable.

1345
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:16,989
TALIESIN: Indeed.

1346
01:44:16,989 --> 01:44:18,073
MATT: "All right."

1347
01:44:18,073 --> 01:44:23,115
She finishes eating. Allura is watching this whole
thing in the distance with her arms crossed.

1348
01:44:23,115 --> 01:44:27,032
"Whenever you're ready, shall we?"

1349
01:44:27,032 --> 01:44:28,643
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1350
01:44:28,643 --> 01:44:29,588
LAURA: All right.

1351
01:44:29,588 --> 01:44:30,763
TRAVIS: Ready.

1352
01:44:30,763 --> 01:44:32,289
TALIESIN: (whispers) We'll be back.

1353
01:44:32,289 --> 01:44:39,496
MATT: "Now, please, hands together."

1354
01:44:39,496 --> 01:44:43,039
And there's a rush of cold wind (whooshing 
sound) which takes up suddenly the familiar

1355
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:49,861
sensation of teleportation as you're all thrust 
back into the outside of the Cloudtop District,

1356
01:44:49,861 --> 01:44:56,862
exterior of the gates. You can see there's still 
smoke rising up, but as opposed to the clouds

1357
01:44:56,862 --> 01:45:01,703
of billowing cinders and flame, it appears that 
most buildings in the immediate vicinity,

1358
01:45:01,703 --> 01:45:07,597
while black and darkened and broken, no longer 
rage of burning fire. The smoke has gone from

1359
01:45:07,597 --> 01:45:14,418
pitch-black to bits of dark grey and plumes 
of white. You can see already there is a bustle

1360
01:45:14,418 --> 01:45:19,511
throughout the city as a number of bodies are 
laid out across the ground with bits of gathered

1361
01:45:19,511 --> 01:45:26,020
cloth placed over them, those who had fallen in 
the battle and are being gathered,

1362
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:30,811
being prepared to be brought back 
to their families.

1363
01:45:30,811 --> 01:45:33,691
MARISHA: I immediately look to the sky.

1364
01:45:33,691 --> 01:45:37,255
Do I see any sign of the Ashari, and what 
do the clouds look like?

1365
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:40,522
MATT: The sky is a clear cloudless crystalline
blue.

1366
01:45:40,522 --> 01:45:41,443
MARISHA: Really?

1367
01:45:41,443 --> 01:45:42,495
MATT: Yes.

1368
01:45:42,495 --> 01:45:46,197
MARISHA: Okay. No sign of Ashari?

1369
01:45:46,197 --> 01:45:53,845
MATT: No, it's been, it's been a day and a half or
so since the battle happened. There is no

1370
01:45:53,845 --> 01:46:01,969
current clouds or storm in the sky. But as you do
appear, you see there are a number of soldiers in

1371
01:46:01,969 --> 01:46:10,925
patchwork armor, some that appeared to be in
similar outfits as the Fort Daxio soldiers that

1372
01:46:10,925 --> 01:46:17,518
you met there during the pre-battle circumstance.
There are few that you recognize as Syngornian

1373
01:46:17,518 --> 01:46:23,230
armor, and a few that are just people gathered
what they could and have been part of the fray and

1374
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:32,591
the recovery process. You can see, in all
the turmoil and darkness and the destruction

1375
01:46:32,591 --> 01:46:37,625
you've seen in this city, it's strangely beautiful
and welcoming to see that there is life thriving

1376
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:43,304
again as people are returning, doors are being
pushed back upon the frames, people are searching

1377
01:46:43,304 --> 01:46:47,122
for survivors behind the rubble and the various
homes, and finding them. And you're seeing

1378
01:46:47,122 --> 01:46:53,536
families that are stepping out and being reunited
as you begin to walk through the street. You can

1379
01:46:53,536 --> 01:47:02,514
see, essentially, the hidden heartbeat of the city
is re-emerging once more to take back what it's

1380
01:47:02,514 --> 01:47:12,349
lost. All of you are caught speechless for
a few moments and you take in this vision,

1381
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:17,438
and begin to walk as Allura kind of leads you,
looking around and walks on and talks to a few

1382
01:47:17,438 --> 01:47:26,749
guards. She glances back to you and kind of
smiles.

1383
01:47:26,749 --> 01:47:34,259
"Well, you've done it."

1384
01:47:34,259 --> 01:47:38,760
And you hear a voice behind her, a kind of echoing
shout.

1385
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:42,537
"Kerrek!"

1386
01:47:42,537 --> 01:47:48,774
And you watch a familiar female face come rushing
up in clanking armor (clanking noises), and she

1387
01:47:48,774 --> 01:47:53,738
rushes up and just socks you across the face.
Whack!

1388
01:47:53,738 --> 01:47:54,832
PATRICK: This is Samantha?

1389
01:47:54,832 --> 01:47:55,777
MATT: This is Samantha.

1390
01:47:55,777 --> 01:47:56,392
(all laugh)

1391
01:47:56,392 --> 01:47:57,855
PATRICK: Okay.

1392
01:47:57,855 --> 01:48:00,779
MATT: Where'd you go?

1393
01:48:00,779 --> 01:48:01,586
PATRICK: What?

1394
01:48:01,586 --> 01:48:06,438
MATT: What'd you do?

1395
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:09,201
PATRICK: What did I do?

1396
01:48:09,201 --> 01:48:11,226
LAURA: That man's a hero.

1397
01:48:11,226 --> 01:48:13,020
MARISHA: He slayed a dragon.

1398
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:13,668
MATT: (laughs)

1399
01:48:13,668 --> 01:48:14,669
LAURA: A giant one.

1400
01:48:14,669 --> 01:48:15,573
MARISHA: The big green one.

1401
01:48:15,573 --> 01:48:17,027
MATT: You've been gone for two days.

1402
01:48:17,027 --> 01:48:17,929
LAURA: Killing a dragon.

1403
01:48:17,929 --> 01:48:21,524
PATRICK: I told you I might be gone for a while.
Is everything okay?

1404
01:48:21,524 --> 01:48:24,961
MATT: Everything's fine, we're ready to go!

1405
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:31,820
PATRICK: Good. Good. Good.

1406
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:42,184
TRAVIS: You're leaving? Where are you
going?

1407
01:48:42,184 --> 01:48:53,130
PATRICK: Back where we came from. I've got a
town to continue looking after. And now I know

1408
01:48:53,130 --> 01:49:05,406
that any work I put into it would probably have
time to become something worthwhile.

1409
01:49:05,406 --> 01:49:10,248
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus you got all that money you took
from down in the dragon's lair, so that helps.

1410
01:49:10,248 --> 01:49:11,586
LAURA: Shh, Grog.

1411
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:14,367
PATRICK: A lot of money.

1412
01:49:14,367 --> 01:49:18,135
LIAM: Hey, make sure your people know.

1413
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:24,365
That man played the final note in the song 
of the Conclave of Dragons.

1414
01:49:24,365 --> 01:49:26,592
MARISHA: It's true.

1415
01:49:26,592 --> 01:49:27,789
TALIESIN: So I'm told.

1416
01:49:27,789 --> 01:49:28,828
MATT: Kerr?

1417
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:29,716
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1418
01:49:29,716 --> 01:49:30,448
LIAM: That's right.

1419
01:49:30,448 --> 01:49:31,241
LAURA: Yeah.

1420
01:49:31,241 --> 01:49:32,913
MARISHA: He's a badass.

1421
01:49:32,913 --> 01:49:34,477
TRAVIS: His hammer glows.

1422
01:49:34,477 --> 01:49:36,422
LAURA: Well it did until it was destroyed by the
dragon.

1423
01:49:36,422 --> 01:49:38,527
MATT: She looks down at her fist.

1424
01:49:38,527 --> 01:49:41,655
"I just punched a badass."

1425
01:49:41,655 --> 01:49:46,239
PATRICK: I'm like, my lip is split, blood out of
my nose, I'm like

1426
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:49,624
"Yeah, that's-- what you got
there is now a holy relic."

1427
01:49:49,624 --> 01:49:52,879
(all laugh)

1428
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:57,287
MATT: She pats you in the arm (clanging noise),
then a clang in her armor against yours.

1429
01:49:57,287 --> 01:49:59,915
"Well, good. Glad to see you back in action.

1430
01:49:59,915 --> 01:50:04,234
"Glad to see you fighting, kicking ass, 
killing dragons."

1431
01:50:04,234 --> 01:50:09,700
PATRICK: Yeah, uh, are folks ready to troop out?

1432
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,319
MATT: And you see her now, her expression goes
from kind of

1433
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,330
joyous excitement to see him return
to a somber tone.

1434
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:20,816
"Yes, um, we have the bodies on carts and 
the rest

1435
01:50:20,816 --> 01:50:24,458
"of us are ready to make the trek back to Westruun."

1436
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:31,835
PATRICK: Okay. Thanks. I'll be along
straight away. I should say my goodbyes.

1437
01:50:31,835 --> 01:50:39,318
MATT: All right, well, about three blocks down 
that way, turn to the right, second square.

1438
01:50:39,318 --> 01:50:40,260
PATRICK: Okay.

1439
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:43,159
MATT: She turns around and makes her way off and,
looking over her shoulder,

1440
01:50:43,159 --> 01:50:46,871
kind of grinning a little bit. Looks at 
her fist again, looks back,

1441
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:48,782
shakes her head, and just keeps walking.

1442
01:50:48,782 --> 01:50:57,189
TRAVIS: (mournfully) Bye, Sam.

1443
01:50:57,189 --> 01:51:15,565
PATRICK: I can't thank you all enough.
And I need you to look after each other.

1444
01:51:15,565 --> 01:51:23,353
Because I will not be here to do it.

1445
01:51:23,353 --> 01:51:28,089
LAURA: You're a good man, Kerr.

1446
01:51:28,089 --> 01:51:36,822
PATRICK: Uh, we do our best.

1447
01:51:36,822 --> 01:51:45,643
PATRICK: He just stands there awkwardly for 
a moment and then turns around and walks away.

1448
01:51:45,643 --> 01:51:51,457
LAURA: Awww.

1449
01:51:51,457 --> 01:51:52,595
ASHLEY: Awww.

1450
01:51:52,595 --> 01:51:54,891
MARISHA: Kerr!

1451
01:51:54,891 --> 01:51:57,832
PATRICK: Turns around.

1452
01:51:57,832 --> 01:52:03,836
MARISHA: Vox Machina was better to have you.

1453
01:52:03,836 --> 01:52:07,365
PATRICK: Well, you know where I am.

1454
01:52:07,365 --> 01:52:11,449
MARISHA: And you know where to find us.

1455
01:52:11,449 --> 01:52:19,525
PATRICK: I'll let you know if we need ya. And
really, really keep an eye on the knots.

1456
01:52:19,525 --> 01:52:21,911
It's-- no
more than four hours.

1457
01:52:21,911 --> 01:52:28,290
(all laugh)

1458
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:31,937
PATRICK: And then I walk off into the sunset.

1459
01:52:31,937 --> 01:52:34,595
LAURA: Ahhhh.

1460
01:52:34,595 --> 01:52:42,094
MATT: As you watch Kerr slowly walk down the
street, looking back, making his way to this

1461
01:52:42,094 --> 01:52:48,344
current chapter of his re-adventuring, to gather
those he brought up here willing to die for the

1462
01:52:48,344 --> 01:52:54,958
battle that you finished, we're going to take a
break.

1463
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:57,586
MATT: We'll be back here in a minute. Patrick
Rothfuss, thank you so much for joining us.

1464
01:52:57,586 --> 01:52:58,388
TRAVIS: Patrick!

1465
01:52:58,388 --> 01:52:59,127
LAURA: Patrick!

1466
01:52:59,127 --> 01:53:00,775
(applause)

1467
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:08,287
PATRICK: Guys, thank you, thank you so much. It
was such a treat. I did not plan on being up in

1468
01:53:08,287 --> 01:53:14,920
your business for so long, but I'm so, so happy 
to be a part of this, for this piece of the story.

1469
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,701
I'm so flattered that you had me.

1470
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:18,221
LIAM: Oh man, mutual, mutual.

1471
01:53:18,221 --> 01:53:19,144
MATT: Definitely.

1472
01:53:19,144 --> 01:53:19,849
LAURA: Yeah.

1473
01:53:19,849 --> 01:53:21,917
MARISHA: There's a green dragon waiting for you.

1474
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:22,925
PATRICK: Woo hoo!

1475
01:53:22,925 --> 01:53:24,009
LAURA: In your bedroom.

1476
01:53:24,009 --> 01:53:26,642
MARISHA: He's in my house and you have to fight me
to get it, so...

1477
01:53:26,642 --> 01:53:27,595
MATT: (laughs)

1478
01:53:27,595 --> 01:53:29,097
PATRICK: Okay, that's a deal.

1479
01:53:29,097 --> 01:53:32,667
MARISHA: But it's technically yours whenever you
come for it.

1480
01:53:32,667 --> 01:53:35,780
LIAM: Three weeks from now, the door opens.
(explosion sound)

1481
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:40,837
MARISHA: Oh, shit! That's fair.

1482
01:53:40,837 --> 01:53:45,075
MATT: Thank you so much, Patrick. Guys, we'll take
a break.

1483
01:53:45,075 --> 01:53:47,442
We have a giveaway, actually, 'cause we
didn't get a break last week.

1484
01:53:47,442 --> 01:53:52,049
We have a big Wormwood giveaway to do here 
at the end of the break, with a big old cluster.

1485
01:53:52,049 --> 01:53:55,333
So, pay attention to the chat room. They'll
have all the information for you on how to get and

1486
01:53:55,333 --> 01:53:58,460
be a part of that. And we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

1487
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:01,127
(all cheer)

1488
01:54:01,127 --> 02:09:22,081
[BREAK]

1489
02:09:22,233 --> 02:09:24,035
MATT: Welcome back to Critical Role.

1490
02:09:24,035 --> 02:09:25,069
(everyone laughs)

1491
02:09:25,069 --> 02:09:27,464
MATT: Apparently, we had a penguin
explode in the background.

1492
02:09:27,464 --> 02:09:29,375
LAURA: That sounded
like Dolores Umbridge.

1493
02:09:29,375 --> 02:09:30,481
TRAVIS: Did Foster just shart?

1494
02:09:30,481 --> 02:09:31,900
TALIESIN: It was like a goose.

1495
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:36,661
TRAVIS: What was it? Who sneezed?

1496
02:09:36,661 --> 02:09:37,900
LAURA: Eddie! (laughs)

1497
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:40,809
LIAM: --specifically thinking, let me give Matt a
little break here. I'll give him a little time.

1498
02:09:40,809 --> 02:09:42,912
And then (makes loud sound).

1499
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:47,326
MATT: There's no break. I get an
instinctual nervousness now right before we go

1500
02:09:47,326 --> 02:09:51,934
live because of you assholes now. Like this kind
of Pavlovian, kind of (nervously) okay.

1501
02:09:51,934 --> 02:09:53,888
TRAVIS: It's like somebody sniped a parakeet. That
was crazy.

1502
02:09:53,888 --> 02:09:55,042
(loud high tooting sound)

1503
02:09:55,042 --> 02:09:56,188
MATT: There it was.

1504
02:09:56,188 --> 02:09:56,843
LAURA: There it is.

1505
02:09:56,843 --> 02:09:57,456
MATT: Second time.

1506
02:09:57,456 --> 02:09:58,518
TRAVIS: Is that a sneeze or is he fucking with us?

1507
02:09:58,518 --> 02:09:59,118
MATT: I don't know.

1508
02:09:59,118 --> 02:10:00,198
LIAM: (mobster voice) It would be a shame if
something

1509
02:10:00,198 --> 02:10:01,561
should happen to your piece of mind
before a D&amp;D game.

1510
02:10:01,561 --> 02:10:03,889
MATT: Yeah, I know. Just keep rolling your dice.

1511
02:10:03,889 --> 02:10:05,908
LIAM: (dying noise)

1512
02:10:05,908 --> 02:10:11,316
MATT: All right, anyway. Welcome back, guys. So
the winner of the contest in the chat room is

1513
02:10:11,316 --> 02:10:15,090
kalagrace. K-A-L-A-G-R-A-C-E. Congratulations!

1514
02:10:15,090 --> 02:10:16,222
(all cheer)

1515
02:10:16,222 --> 02:10:19,115
MATT: You're going to win a bunch of stuff.

1516
02:10:19,115 --> 02:10:20,186
MARISHA: You got stuff!

1517
02:10:20,186 --> 02:10:21,672
MATT: They haven't told me. From Wyrmwood.

1518
02:10:21,672 --> 02:10:22,654
LAURA: What stuff, though?

1519
02:10:22,654 --> 02:10:24,255
MATT: Cool stuff, apparently.

1520
02:10:24,255 --> 02:10:25,913
TRAVIS: Pantomime it.

1521
02:10:25,913 --> 02:10:27,914
MATT: There's stuff here in a big stack this big.

1522
02:10:27,914 --> 02:10:28,733
LAURA: This kind of stuff?

1523
02:10:28,733 --> 02:10:29,680
MATT: That kind of stuff.

1524
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,076
MARISHA: I imagine it's wood, and it's box-shaped.

1525
02:10:31,076 --> 02:10:35,790
MATT: But you won it, and it's going to be really
cool, so congratulations kalagrace.

1526
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:36,852
LAURA: You just wait.

1527
02:10:36,852 --> 02:10:37,842
MATT: Boom!

1528
02:10:37,842 --> 02:10:39,682
TALIESIN: You just wait.

1529
02:10:39,682 --> 02:10:44,464
MATT: (laughs) All right, so back into the game.

1530
02:10:44,464 --> 02:10:52,402
After you watched Kerrek walk away, the city
itself is getting its bearings. People are

1531
02:10:52,402 --> 02:11:01,986
returning to the recovery process, post-Conclave.
Emon's rebuilding and restructuring.

1532
02:11:01,986 --> 02:11:03,725
What do you guys want to do?

1533
02:11:03,725 --> 02:11:05,736
LAURA: (sighs)

1534
02:11:05,736 --> 02:11:07,928
MATT: Did you retrieve your items, by the way,
from the ritual?

1535
02:11:07,928 --> 02:11:09,965
TRAVIS: Yes, I did want to grab them from the
temple.

1536
02:11:09,965 --> 02:11:12,904
MATT: Okay, yeah. I assumed post-ritual you
weren't going to

1537
02:11:12,904 --> 02:11:15,503
just leave your favorite
artifacts on the altar.

1538
02:11:15,503 --> 02:11:18,469
TRAVIS: No! I got them.

1539
02:11:18,469 --> 02:11:22,060
TALIESIN: And I flipped the Dragonslayer Longsword
for the Gloves of Missile Snaring.

1540
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:23,528
That was the last thing I did.

1541
02:11:23,528 --> 02:11:28,566
MATT: Traded it out? Okay. Cool. What else would
you guys like to do? What's your plan?

1542
02:11:28,566 --> 02:11:33,029
TRAVIS: We do have a grocery list of things that
we could pick from, right?

1543
02:11:33,029 --> 02:11:35,337
LAURA: We have a lot of stuff we need to do.

1544
02:11:35,337 --> 02:11:37,327
MARISHA: A ton of stuff we need to do.

1545
02:11:37,327 --> 02:11:39,759
TRAVIS: Do we want to make good on that promise
real fast, or what?

1546
02:11:39,759 --> 02:11:40,723
MARISHA: Which one?

1547
02:11:40,723 --> 02:11:42,370
MARISHA: The eighth one we have?

1548
02:11:42,370 --> 02:11:44,297
TRAVIS: The thing under the tree?

1549
02:11:44,297 --> 02:11:46,760
LAURA: That's in Vasselheim.

1550
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,445
LAURA: We also have a hand to deliver to Marquet.

1551
02:11:48,445 --> 02:11:53,177
MARISHA: And a rakshasa to kill.

1552
02:11:53,177 --> 02:11:56,138
TRAVIS: Hey, let's hold off on that one, I think.

1553
02:11:56,138 --> 02:12:01,346
MARISHA: Maybe we should start with checking in
with home? Seeing how the keep is?

1554
02:12:01,346 --> 02:12:02,817
We haven't been home in a long time.

1555
02:12:02,817 --> 02:12:03,778
TRAVIS: Oh, Greyskull?

1556
02:12:03,778 --> 02:12:05,228
LAURA: We were just there.

1557
02:12:05,228 --> 02:12:07,858
MARISHA: I guess we were just there in passing.

1558
02:12:07,858 --> 02:12:14,865
TRAVIS: We're all sore, right? We could knock the
dust off a little bit if we just did a little

1559
02:12:14,865 --> 02:12:18,402
delivery, like some final remains into a tree, or
a hand, or whatever.

1560
02:12:18,402 --> 02:12:21,534
LIAM: We just ended a threat to civilization.

1561
02:12:21,534 --> 02:12:24,582
I don't feel like diving into the Nine Hells, 
at the moment.

1562
02:12:24,582 --> 02:12:25,195
MARISHA: No.

1563
02:12:25,195 --> 02:12:26,155
LAURA: Yeah, not so much.

1564
02:12:26,155 --> 02:12:27,117
TALIESIN: No, not really.

1565
02:12:27,117 --> 02:12:28,432
MARISHA: I'm tired.

1566
02:12:28,432 --> 02:12:29,850
TRAVIS: Where is the hand going, again?

1567
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:32,165
LAURA AND MARISHA: Marquet.

1568
02:12:32,165 --> 02:12:33,266
TRAVIS: Why?

1569
02:12:33,266 --> 02:12:35,807
LAURA: Because we told them we would give them a
hand.

1570
02:12:35,807 --> 02:12:42,553
TRAVIS: Who did we promise that to?

1571
02:12:42,553 --> 02:12:48,039
LAURA: You know, the thieves'
guild thing. The group of assassins.

1572
02:12:48,039 --> 02:12:51,174
TRAVIS: That's boring. Let's go to Vasselheim.

1573
02:12:51,174 --> 02:12:52,734
MARISHA: Right now?

1574
02:12:52,734 --> 02:12:58,064
LAURA: Shouldn't we help with making sure the
Council is in place? Is everything solid here?

1575
02:12:58,064 --> 02:13:03,183
MATT: You've been gone for a couple of days, and
it's been moving. You could ask around if you want

1576
02:13:03,183 --> 02:13:07,279
to try and get some information about the current
circumstance.

1577
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:08,775
TRAVIS: I guess we could do that.

1578
02:13:08,775 --> 02:13:09,998
LAURA: Just to make sure.

1579
02:13:09,998 --> 02:13:14,592
MARISHA: Maybe we should also check in with some
of our other keep members,

1580
02:13:14,592 --> 02:13:16,753
and see who's alive and
who's dead?

1581
02:13:16,753 --> 02:13:19,620
MATT: The people of your keep you brought to
Whitestone with you. They've been there.

1582
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:21,608
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. I totally--

1583
02:13:21,608 --> 02:13:23,136
MATT: It's been a while. It's been a year.

1584
02:13:23,136 --> 02:13:24,058
MARISHA: That's right.

1585
02:13:24,058 --> 02:13:26,953
LAURA: How is Jarett? Was he fine when we got back
to Whitestone?

1586
02:13:26,953 --> 02:13:28,562
MATT: Jarett is recovering.

1587
02:13:28,562 --> 02:13:29,587
LAURA: Okay.

1588
02:13:29,587 --> 02:13:31,751
MARISHA: Did he come back with us, or is he still
in Whitestone?

1589
02:13:31,751 --> 02:13:32,945
MATT: Jarett's still in Whitestone.

1590
02:13:32,945 --> 02:13:34,988
LAURA: He's like, "Fuck you!"

1591
02:13:34,988 --> 02:13:41,877
MATT: Jarett's proud and excited about the things
you've accomplished, but Jarett needs a vacation.

1592
02:13:41,877 --> 02:13:43,482
LIAM: He's got to find some drugs, too.

1593
02:13:43,482 --> 02:13:45,244
MATT: Yeah.

1594
02:13:45,244 --> 02:13:48,124
MATT: He's not happy about that.

1595
02:13:48,124 --> 02:13:49,378
TRAVIS: Modify Memory.

1596
02:13:49,378 --> 02:14:00,100
MATT: (laughs) If you want to roll an
investigation check, Vex.

1597
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,101
LAURA: 19.

1598
02:14:01,101 --> 02:14:01,894
MATT: Okay.

1599
02:14:01,894 --> 02:14:03,116
LAURA: N-n-n-n-nineteen.

1600
02:14:03,116 --> 02:14:06,588
MATT: Spending the next hour or so asking around
from various people, you don't come across any

1601
02:14:06,588 --> 02:14:16,236
notable allies that you recognize, but the word is
that the remaining bulk of the standing army of

1602
02:14:16,236 --> 02:14:22,634
Emon and Fort Daxio, combined with the remnants of
Syngorn's army-- half went back to Syngorn, just

1603
02:14:22,634 --> 02:14:28,984
in case, and the other half remained to help with
the relief effort here-- as well as The Clasp.

1604
02:14:28,984 --> 02:14:32,072
The Clasp is now bringing people they'd been 
keeping underground

1605
02:14:32,072 --> 02:14:34,993
and hidden back to their homes, back
to their locations.

1606
02:14:34,993 --> 02:14:39,776
It seems that the structure, for now, is focused
on the relief effort

1607
02:14:39,776 --> 02:14:42,833
and the returning of the city
to its people.

1608
02:14:42,833 --> 02:14:47,208
As far as the actual Council structure, you don't 
hear anything yet, on that point.

1609
02:14:47,208 --> 02:14:48,402
LAURA: Okay.

1610
02:14:48,402 --> 02:14:50,740
MATT: To be fair, half of the Council was at
Whitestone,

1611
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:56,812
and you haven't heard from any of the people that 
you knew on the Council who came as

1612
02:14:56,812 --> 02:15:04,751
part of the battle yet. What do you guys want to
do?

1613
02:15:04,751 --> 02:15:08,021
TRAVIS: We don't need to check in with The Clasp,
do we, or anything?

1614
02:15:08,021 --> 02:15:09,368
TALIESIN: (groans)

1615
02:15:09,368 --> 02:15:12,378
LAURA: No. They kind of have their shit that
they're doing.

1616
02:15:12,378 --> 02:15:14,787
MARISHA: We're fine, right?

1617
02:15:14,787 --> 02:15:16,206
LAURA: We're solid.

1618
02:15:16,206 --> 02:15:18,770
LIAM: I'm just going to throw this out: if we
leave things as they are,

1619
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:23,681
The Clasp are going to
completely ruin the city.

1620
02:15:23,681 --> 02:15:27,092
At some point soon, we might want to get 
some of the Council back here faster.

1621
02:15:27,092 --> 02:15:28,782
LAURA: Well, Allura's here.

1622
02:15:28,782 --> 02:15:31,018
LIAM: That's one, yeah.

1623
02:15:31,018 --> 02:15:33,293
TRAVIS: Do we know where everyone else is?

1624
02:15:33,293 --> 02:15:34,275
LIAM: Whitestone.

1625
02:15:34,275 --> 02:15:41,038
LAURA: Well, the problem is, Uriel was killed when
the dragons attacked.

1626
02:15:41,038 --> 02:15:43,357
Nothing else was ever set in
place after that.

1627
02:15:43,357 --> 02:15:44,821
MARISHA: That's true. Who was acting as--

1628
02:15:44,821 --> 02:15:45,864
LAURA: Thordak.

1629
02:15:45,864 --> 02:15:54,347
MATT: Well, when Sovereign was slain, part of his
instruction was to hand power entirely over to the

1630
02:15:54,347 --> 02:16:04,741
Council. So we are still the power structure of
the city. It's more of a localized republic. We

1631
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:09,621
need to enforce that structure. While you take to
what business you need, I'm going to try the best

1632
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:17,842
I can to amass the remaining members of that
Council and install some sort of political

1633
02:16:17,842 --> 02:16:23,585
structure here, now. Partly for the reason you
mentioned,

1634
02:16:23,585 --> 02:16:29,627
and partly because we don't want the
military suddenly running the show, either.

1635
02:16:29,627 --> 02:16:37,152
MARISHA: So as a quick recap, he stepped down and
gave this whole speech that he sees the flaws in

1636
02:16:37,152 --> 02:16:39,882
one ruler, and wants to hand it over to a council
rule--

1637
02:16:39,882 --> 02:16:42,886
MATT: Yeah. He didn't want to be a tyrant with
advisors.

1638
02:16:42,886 --> 02:16:46,262
He wanted to have a council that best
represented the people's interests in power.

1639
02:16:46,262 --> 02:16:51,449
MARISHA: Right. He essentially switched it from a
monarchy to a republic.

1640
02:16:51,449 --> 02:16:52,321
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

1641
02:16:52,321 --> 02:16:53,222
MARISHA: Okay.

1642
02:16:53,222 --> 02:16:55,748
TALIEISN: And we have the rest of the royal family
in Whitestone.

1643
02:16:55,748 --> 02:16:59,278
MATT: Yes. Salda and the children are currently
there.

1644
02:16:59,278 --> 02:17:05,051
We've kept them safe, and Salda will most
likely be placed on the Council, as she has quite

1645
02:17:05,051 --> 02:17:13,871
a bit of knowledge and experience, and to keep the
memory. If we can recover his body or some

1646
02:17:13,871 --> 02:17:22,740
semblance of it, I will also see that there is a
monument built to the memory of the Sovereign.

1647
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,670
TRAVIS: Yep.

1648
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:27,854
LIAM: And you think you've got a handle on getting
a foothold here?

1649
02:17:27,854 --> 02:17:34,570
MATT: I think if I can find one or two of my
friends, definitely.

1650
02:17:34,570 --> 02:17:38,398
MARISHA: Do you need help in finding your friends?

1651
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:42,984
MATT: Your strengths are best tended to
elsewhere.

1652
02:17:42,984 --> 02:17:44,201
MARISHA: Okay.

1653
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:49,034
MATT: Don't worry. I know Mikhail is around, and
me and him have a good rapport, and he has the

1654
02:17:49,034 --> 02:17:55,769
military at his back, so if anything goes south or
wrong, I know how to let you know. So much as you

1655
02:17:55,769 --> 02:17:59,829
stay on this realm. Don't go vanishing to other
planes without letting me know, please.

1656
02:17:59,829 --> 02:18:00,828
LAURA: No Feywild?

1657
02:18:00,828 --> 02:18:02,347
MATT: Please. No.

1658
02:18:02,347 --> 02:18:03,675
TALIESIN: Not for a bit.

1659
02:18:03,675 --> 02:18:06,044
LAURA: Not for a bit. Allura, before we leave.

1660
02:18:06,044 --> 02:18:06,920
MATT: Yes?

1661
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:08,969
LAURA: Will you take a look?

1662
02:18:08,969 --> 02:18:12,541
I hand her the box of ashes that Senokir gave us.

1663
02:18:12,541 --> 02:18:18,166
Do you sense any kind of aura coming off of this, 
or do you think it is what he said:

1664
02:18:18,166 --> 02:18:22,550
just a box of his wife's
ashes?

1665
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:28,012
MATT: She takes the dark box, and it has small
chained edges on each end.

1666
02:18:28,012 --> 02:18:32,589
She inspects it for a moment.

1667
02:18:32,589 --> 02:18:38,102
"The box does have a very faint magical
essence to it, but it appears to be purely

1668
02:18:38,102 --> 02:18:44,507
"protective. I'm not entirely certain of anything
beyond that. It's very faint."

1669
02:18:44,507 --> 02:18:47,181
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

1670
02:18:47,181 --> 02:18:48,865
MARISHA: Kima's with us, right?

1671
02:18:48,865 --> 02:18:54,564
MATT: Kima's in the process of going around and
gathering information and checking in.

1672
02:18:54,564 --> 02:18:57,479
MARISHA: I grab Vax and Vex really quick, and I
say,

1673
02:18:57,479 --> 02:19:02,703
Hey. You guys are really good at asking
people back for the stuff that we lent them.

1674
02:19:02,703 --> 02:19:08,801
I feel a little rude doing that, but you guys are
good at that. So--

1675
02:19:08,801 --> 02:19:10,229
LAURA: Oh! Kima?

1676
02:19:10,229 --> 02:19:11,072
MARISHA: The boots.

1677
02:19:11,072 --> 02:19:12,330
LAURA: Hey, those boots?

1678
02:19:12,330 --> 02:19:13,805
MARISHA: See? You guys are good at it.

1679
02:19:13,805 --> 02:19:14,739
MATT: What?

1680
02:19:14,739 --> 02:19:17,077
LIAM: Hey, you know those boots you hate wearing?

1681
02:19:17,077 --> 02:19:18,755
MATT: Oh, they're fantastic. I love them.

1682
02:19:18,755 --> 02:19:19,685
LIAM: Oh, shit.

1683
02:19:19,685 --> 02:19:21,676
(all laugh)

1684
02:19:21,676 --> 02:19:26,290
LAURA: It's unfortunate that they look a little
iffy with your armor, though.

1685
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:28,856
Just kind of-- can
we have them back, please?

1686
02:19:28,856 --> 02:19:31,017
LIAM: Yeah.

1687
02:19:31,017 --> 02:19:34,972
LAURA: We might be sneaking around, you know, in
life or death situations,

1688
02:19:34,972 --> 02:19:36,850
and you're going to be
here with the Council.

1689
02:19:36,850 --> 02:19:41,549
MARISHA: Pike is very clanky. No offense, Pike.

1690
02:19:41,549 --> 02:19:44,856
ASHLEY: No, none taken.

1691
02:19:44,856 --> 02:19:49,460
LIAM: You look like a badass gladiator in Yuletide
socks.

1692
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,013
MATT: She holds her Holy Avenger out in front of
her and checks its blade.

1693
02:19:53,013 --> 02:19:54,076
LAURA: We did give you that.

1694
02:19:54,076 --> 02:19:57,743
MARISHA: You can keep it.

1695
02:19:57,743 --> 02:20:05,077
MATT: (metal scraping noise) "Fine!" She bends
down, and kind of... (grunt of effort).

1696
02:20:05,077 --> 02:20:08,909
LIAM, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Eyyy.

1697
02:20:08,909 --> 02:20:10,004
TRAVIS: Kima!

1698
02:20:10,004 --> 02:20:11,012
LAURA: Those are for you, man!

1699
02:20:11,012 --> 02:20:11,932
ASHLEY: Those are mine?

1700
02:20:11,932 --> 02:20:16,208
MATT: She's now barefoot in full armor. Kind of
wiggles her toes and goes--

1701
02:20:16,208 --> 02:20:18,529
ASHLEY: I can give her the shoes that I was
wearing!

1702
02:20:18,529 --> 02:20:20,844
LAURA: No, cause you have the Sprinter's Boots on.

1703
02:20:20,844 --> 02:20:21,575
ASHLEY: What are they?

1704
02:20:21,575 --> 02:20:22,536
LAURA: You got the Sprinter's Boots on.

1705
02:20:22,536 --> 02:20:23,435
ASHLEY: What's she giving me?

1706
02:20:23,435 --> 02:20:24,793
LAURA: She's giving you the Elven Boots.

1707
02:20:24,793 --> 02:20:25,973
MARISHA: They're like stealthy boots.

1708
02:20:25,973 --> 02:20:27,414
LAURA: They're stealth boots! They make you
silent!

1709
02:20:27,414 --> 02:20:28,383
ASHLEY: Oh, shit!

1710
02:20:28,383 --> 02:20:30,895
MARISHA: They're silent! And you don't have to
attune to them!

1711
02:20:30,895 --> 02:20:32,631
ASHLEY: Thanks for giving those back.

1712
02:20:32,631 --> 02:20:34,707
(all laugh)

1713
02:20:34,707 --> 02:20:36,781
ASHLEY: We need 'em.

1714
02:20:36,781 --> 02:20:39,015
TRAVIS: She's staring at you.

1715
02:20:39,015 --> 02:20:40,464
ASHLEY: I-- You're great.

1716
02:20:40,464 --> 02:20:42,418
(all laugh)

1717
02:20:42,418 --> 02:20:43,864
MATT: She actually laughs back at you and says,

1718
02:20:43,864 --> 02:20:47,017
"I know."

1719
02:20:47,017 --> 02:20:50,258
LAURA: Kima, seriously though. You are great.

1720
02:20:50,258 --> 02:20:56,290
MATT: And you know, she's been kind of a ball of
intensity in all of this and she's had frustrating

1721
02:20:56,290 --> 02:21:01,459
moment in combat and she's had earnest fear and
she's had her own journey with you guys from the

1722
02:21:01,459 --> 02:21:04,104
beginning when crossing your paths. She walks up,
and--

1723
02:21:04,104 --> 02:21:07,740
MARISHA: Look, we smoothed it over. We're cool
now.

1724
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:09,844
(laughter)

1725
02:21:09,844 --> 02:21:14,162
TRAVIS: In between salsa and chips there. Killer.

1726
02:21:14,162 --> 02:21:18,497
MATT: Kima walks up and places her hand on Pike's
shoulder,

1727
02:21:18,497 --> 02:21:27,005
a little bit shorter than her, and looks
at the rest of you,

1728
02:21:27,005 --> 02:21:33,929
"You've done more than anyone ever asked you 
to do. Done a lot of good things.

1729
02:21:33,929 --> 02:21:43,982
"For me, for Allie. For everyone. I know I can be 
a pain in the ass sometimes.

1730
02:21:43,982 --> 02:21:48,520
"I know I get a
little hot-headed."

1731
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:51,113
LAURA: Lies! Lies.

1732
02:21:51,113 --> 02:22:01,240
MATT: But I just-- thank you for letting me come
along.

1733
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:05,331
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thanks for kicking ass with us.

1734
02:22:05,331 --> 02:22:07,873
MATT: We're not done yet!

1735
02:22:07,873 --> 02:22:09,293
LAURA: We're not?

1736
02:22:09,293 --> 02:22:10,899
MATT: (laughs) 'course not!

1737
02:22:10,899 --> 02:22:13,594
What, you think one of these Clasp bastards 
won't start wandering the town?

1738
02:22:13,594 --> 02:22:16,854
TRAVIS: Whew! Thank goodness.

1739
02:22:16,854 --> 02:22:19,560
MATT: Now, if you guys end up actually going back
to Vasselheim,

1740
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:26,891
and Mr. Vord starts coming around, asking 
questions... tell him you haven't seen me.

1741
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:29,521
LAURA: (laughs) You got it.

1742
02:22:29,521 --> 02:22:31,034
TRAVIS: Lie?

1743
02:22:31,034 --> 02:22:35,172
MATT: No, no! Just tell him you haven't seen me.

1744
02:22:35,172 --> 02:22:36,951
TRAVIS: Well, I have seen you.

1745
02:22:36,951 --> 02:22:40,639
MATT: Tell him you haven't.

1746
02:22:40,639 --> 02:22:50,399
(all laugh)

1747
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:56,420
MARISHA: You are the cutest thing sometimes!

1748
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:01,014
LIAM: He's like the chihuahua with the bulging
eyes!

1749
02:23:01,014 --> 02:23:07,846
MATT: Kima just goes-- Kima walks past Pike and
goes up and pats you on the chest.

1750
02:23:07,846 --> 02:23:12,520
"It's okay, Big Man. Forget I said anything."

1751
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:13,704
Then turns back you
guys and goes,

1752
02:23:13,704 --> 02:23:16,167
"I'm sorry! I didn't know!"

1753
02:23:16,167 --> 02:23:18,108
ASHLEY: We'll say the words.

1754
02:23:18,108 --> 02:23:19,814
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

1755
02:23:19,814 --> 02:23:24,903
MATT: "All right, all right. Well, stay safe.

1756
02:23:24,903 --> 02:23:30,098
And if you need someone's skull cracked in, 
you know where to find me."

1757
02:23:30,098 --> 02:23:33,641
She turns back and runs after
Allura, who's currently walking off to go ahead

1758
02:23:33,641 --> 02:23:38,647
and find the rest of her connections in the city.
What do you guys want to do?

1759
02:23:38,647 --> 02:23:41,317
LIAM: It was like he polymorphed into something!

1760
02:23:41,317 --> 02:23:44,924
TRAVIS: (silly noise)

1761
02:23:44,924 --> 02:23:46,905
ASHLEY: That face will be burned into my brain.

1762
02:23:46,905 --> 02:23:49,644
(all laugh)

1763
02:23:49,644 --> 02:23:53,168
TALIESIN: Don't talk to me. Sorry.

1764
02:23:53,226 --> 02:23:54,630
ASHLEY: Okay.

1765
02:23:54,630 --> 02:23:56,414
LAURA: Shit!

1766
02:23:56,414 --> 02:23:58,512
TRAVIS: What easy thing can we accomplish?

1767
02:23:58,512 --> 02:24:00,259
TALIESIN: I say we go to Vasselheim.

1768
02:24:00,259 --> 02:24:02,445
MARISHA: Well, wait, aren't we going to check in
with our keep?

1769
02:24:02,445 --> 02:24:04,019
LAURA: Yeah! Let's walk to our keep and bamf out
there.

1770
02:24:04,019 --> 02:24:05,162
TALIESIN: We'll walk to our keep--

1771
02:24:05,162 --> 02:24:07,955
MARISHA: If anything, that means we came to Emon
for nothing--

1772
02:24:07,955 --> 02:24:08,925
LAURA: Yeah, pretty much.

1773
02:24:08,925 --> 02:24:09,948
MARISHA: --except to go to our Keep.

1774
02:24:09,948 --> 02:24:11,254
TALIESIN: We made a double-check.

1775
02:24:11,254 --> 02:24:13,079
LAURA: Yeah! We had to make sure everything was
alright here.

1776
02:24:13,079 --> 02:24:14,049
TALISIN: It was a free ride.

1777
02:24:14,049 --> 02:24:14,900
MARISHA: That's true.

1778
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:16,036
TRAVIS: Cool! To the keep.

1779
02:24:16,036 --> 02:24:19,975
MARISHA: And as I'm walking through, I keep an eye
out to see if there are any Ashari lingering

1780
02:24:19,975 --> 02:24:23,594
around but I'm sure they've all bounced at this
point.

1781
02:24:23,594 --> 02:24:25,625
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

1782
02:24:25,625 --> 02:24:32,138
MARISHA: Alright. I'm gonna use my druid die. 
Oh, okay. Just straight perception?

1783
02:24:32,138 --> 02:24:32,622
MATT: Yup.

1784
02:24:32,622 --> 02:24:33,617
MARISHA: 26.

1785
02:24:33,617 --> 02:24:39,662
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue your way through
the city, and you keep an eye out, you don't see

1786
02:24:39,662 --> 02:24:48,956
anybody with an Ashari dress. You do see a handful
of occasional bodies in Ashari dress.

1787
02:24:48,956 --> 02:24:50,252
MARISHA: Sure.

1788
02:24:50,252 --> 02:24:55,897
MATT: And you very carefully go and inspect, and
while you recognise a handful,

1789
02:24:55,897 --> 02:24:59,279
you didn't know
them extremely well.

1790
02:24:59,279 --> 02:25:00,974
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been gone awhile.

1791
02:25:00,974 --> 02:25:05,011
MATT: Older folks you didn't connect with. But
thankfully not Korren.

1792
02:25:05,011 --> 02:25:09,721
MARISHA: Okay

1793
02:25:09,721 --> 02:25:13,895
MATT: But yeah there is no walking presence here
of the Ashari.

1794
02:25:13,895 --> 02:25:17,844
You ask around a bit and one of the
guards is like,

1795
02:25:17,844 --> 02:25:22,224
"Supposed to be coming back here in a few days to
gather the dead but they went ahead and chased the

1796
02:25:22,224 --> 02:25:27,392
"rest of them wyvern riders up to the mountains.
Think they're still at the Storm Crest."

1797
02:25:27,392 --> 02:25:29,031
MARISHA: So the Storm Crest.

1798
02:25:29,031 --> 02:25:30,190
MATT: Probably.

1799
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:31,614
MARISHA: Still fighting?

1800
02:25:31,614 --> 02:25:35,015
MATT: Well at least picking off what they can.

1801
02:25:35,015 --> 02:25:37,791
MARISHA: All right, thank you.

1802
02:25:37,791 --> 02:25:40,120
MARISHA: If you see any of them,

1803
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:47,848
just let them know that Vox Machina passed 
through here and that we're all still alive.

1804
02:25:47,848 --> 02:25:50,224
MATT: "Will do."

1805
02:25:50,224 --> 02:25:51,402
And keeps on walking

1806
02:25:51,402 --> 02:25:57,289
MARISHA: Any bodies that I pass by that are Ashari,
I druidcraft little flowers and do

1807
02:25:57,289 --> 02:26:01,066
my own little rituals as I walk by.

1808
02:26:01,066 --> 02:26:09,030
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way through Emon,
eventually the southern walls to the outside of

1809
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:17,072
Greyskull Keep there standing still proud,
undamaged in the fray, still holding the fresh

1810
02:26:17,072 --> 02:26:24,107
stonework crafted by your planar ally that you
summoned quite some time ago

1811
02:26:24,107 --> 02:26:28,479
LAURA: You got a-- remember a servant of Sarenrae
came down and helped us rebuild

1812
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,384
MATT: Yeah after the Vorugal fight that
destroyed--

1813
02:26:30,384 --> 02:26:31,540
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

1814
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:40,244
MATT: -- the temple. But yeah, the keep is, 
currently the front gates are open.

1815
02:26:40,244 --> 02:26:47,720
As you walk in it looks like since you were
last there there have been a few people that have

1816
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:51,404
come through and looked for things.

1817
02:26:51,404 --> 02:26:55,716
Doesn't look like it were raided by thieves by any
means, but it looks like anything that was left in

1818
02:26:55,716 --> 02:26:59,574
the kitchen has been ransacked. Looks like tables
and chairs and some bedrooms have been moved,

1819
02:26:59,574 --> 02:27:07,574
whether they briefly held up refugees from
the city who have then gone back in, or people that

1820
02:27:07,574 --> 02:27:11,741
just moseyed through and left, but the place is
still currently empty.

1821
02:27:11,741 --> 02:27:15,056
LAURA: Eventually we do have to hire some people
again.

1822
02:27:15,056 --> 02:27:19,972
MARISHA: Yeah, get this place lively again.

1823
02:27:19,972 --> 02:27:24,265
TRAVIS: I think it looks nice. I mean, it's kind 
of like a lived-in look.

1824
02:27:24,265 --> 02:27:25,116
ASHLEY: Rustic?

1825
02:27:25,116 --> 02:27:26,839
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1826
02:27:26,839 --> 02:27:29,105
LAURA: Minimalistic now.

1827
02:27:29,105 --> 02:27:31,253
MARISHA: Hire people.

1828
02:27:31,253 --> 02:27:33,904
LIAM: We can start to look for new hands yeah.

1829
02:27:33,904 --> 02:27:40,402
MARISHA: I go through and use my Gust cantrip and 
dust off some shelves

1830
02:27:40,402 --> 02:27:42,530
and straighten some paintings.

1831
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:44,527
MATT: (fwoosh) There's a lot of dust.

1832
02:27:44,527 --> 02:27:47,642
LAURA: I wonder if we should offer this up to the
city to the council to house some refugees that

1833
02:27:47,642 --> 02:27:52,386
haven't found homes again, after they've
been destroyed.

1834
02:27:52,386 --> 02:27:53,362
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

1835
02:27:53,362 --> 02:27:55,409
TALIESIN: Not a terrible idea at all.

1836
02:27:55,409 --> 02:27:57,910
MARISHA: It's not like we're gonna be using it any
time soon.

1837
02:27:57,910 --> 02:27:58,934
LAURA: Right.

1838
02:27:58,934 --> 02:28:00,124
ASHLEY: It's a great idea.

1839
02:28:00,124 --> 02:28:02,331
TRAVIS: We do tend to wander.

1840
02:28:02,331 --> 02:28:06,989
TALIESIN: We'll need to install the teleportation
circle at some point, perhaps.

1841
02:28:06,989 --> 02:28:10,133
LAURA: Should I run back and tell Allura that
before we head out?

1842
02:28:10,133 --> 02:28:13,063
MARISHA: Yeah, let me check on the garden, too.
Pike, do you want to join me?

1843
02:28:13,063 --> 02:28:13,978
ASHLEY: Yes.

1844
02:28:13,978 --> 02:28:15,997
LAURA: I'll head off on the broom and try to find
Allura.

1845
02:28:15,997 --> 02:28:19,941
MATT: Yup. It'll take you couple hours to get 
there and hunt her down

1846
02:28:19,941 --> 02:28:22,243
but you do so and let her know.

1847
02:28:22,243 --> 02:28:24,845
ASHLEY: Go look at the garden and temple.

1848
02:28:24,845 --> 02:28:27,105
MARISHA: How's it looking?

1849
02:28:27,105 --> 02:28:31,035
MATT: The blessings placed upon it and the
position of sunlight,

1850
02:28:31,035 --> 02:28:35,493
a little overgrown, but flourishing.

1851
02:28:35,493 --> 02:28:37,939
MARISHA: Wow, overgrown's better than dead.

1852
02:28:37,939 --> 02:28:39,746
MATT: Yeah.

1853
02:28:39,746 --> 02:28:40,679
MARISHA: All right cool.

1854
02:28:40,679 --> 02:28:42,234
ASHLEY: I like it a little overgrown.

1855
02:28:42,234 --> 02:28:43,791
MARISHA: It's nice, it's kinda rustic.

1856
02:28:43,791 --> 02:28:44,559
MATT: (laughs)

1857
02:28:44,559 --> 02:28:46,578
TALIESIN: Seems to be the word of the day.

1858
02:28:46,644 --> 02:28:48,732
(all laugh)

1859
02:28:48,732 --> 02:28:50,595
TRAVIS: Can I go down to Percy's room?

1860
02:28:50,595 --> 02:28:51,666
MATT: Mm-hm, the workshop?

1861
02:28:51,666 --> 02:28:54,261
TRAVIS: Yeah, the workshop. Is the door closed?

1862
02:28:54,261 --> 02:28:55,438
MATT: It is partially ajar.

1863
02:28:55,438 --> 02:28:56,224
TRAVIS: (gasps)

1864
02:28:56,224 --> 02:28:57,363
MATT: It is dark inside there--

1865
02:28:57,363 --> 02:28:59,717
TRAVIS: Fucking sweet. I go in.

1866
02:28:59,717 --> 02:29:02,384
(all laugh)

1867
02:29:02,384 --> 02:29:04,418
TRAVIS: Is there any light inside?

1868
02:29:04,418 --> 02:29:07,544
MATT: There are a couple of small oil lamps that
are hanging from the walls.

1869
02:29:07,544 --> 02:29:12,333
They are not currently lit, and the forge is dark,
cold there-- most of the tools have already

1870
02:29:12,333 --> 02:29:18,547
been stolen or taken, anything that can be 
grabbed by hand is gone.

1871
02:29:18,547 --> 02:29:22,230
TRAVIS: Are there any of those dangerous buckets
of water around?

1872
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:27,886
MATT: There are a couple, and it smells
of stale hard water.

1873
02:29:27,886 --> 02:29:29,263
TRAVIS: Treacherous.

1874
02:29:29,263 --> 02:29:33,759
(all laugh)

1875
02:29:33,759 --> 02:29:40,855
TRAVIS: Don't really know what I'm looking for.
Are there any like powders? Like sacks of powder--

1876
02:29:40,855 --> 02:29:42,365
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1877
02:29:42,365 --> 02:29:49,570
TRAVIS: --crates of powder, or-- Oh,
that's not terrible! 14.

1878
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:59,196
MATT: You do find what looks to be a small
brown wooden barrel-type container. It has a lid on

1879
02:29:59,249 --> 02:30:03,977
it, but it's easy to pull off. And on the inside it
has a familiar smell that you catch whenever

1880
02:30:03,977 --> 02:30:11,839
you see Percy fiddling with his weapons, sort of a
dark powder substance.

1881
02:30:11,839 --> 02:30:13,561
TRAVIS: Can I pour a little out?

1882
02:30:13,561 --> 02:30:20,596
MATT: Yup. Looks like soot or charcoal
dust, grainy like sand.

1883
02:30:20,596 --> 02:30:24,820
LIAM: Can I have snuck down and be watching this?

1884
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:28,003
MATT: Make a perception check.

1885
02:30:28,003 --> 02:30:31,856
LIAM: That's pretty high, that is a
30.

1886
02:30:31,856 --> 02:30:36,398
MATT: Yeah, you totally saw Grog just stomp down
into the lower area so you can go ahead and...

1887
02:30:36,398 --> 02:30:38,366
LIAM: Thanks.

1888
02:30:38,366 --> 02:30:44,662
TRAVIS: Hm, no fire, dangerous water, no
weapons?

1889
02:30:44,662 --> 02:30:46,874
(all laugh)

1890
02:30:46,874 --> 02:30:49,541
MATT: Does not appear to be any weapons in the
room.

1891
02:30:49,541 --> 02:30:53,179
There are the racks where tools are usually
hung on that you remember but they're all gone.

1892
02:30:53,179 --> 02:30:53,982
TRAVIS: Shit.

1893
02:30:53,982 --> 02:30:57,073
MATT: There's just nubs out of the wall.

1894
02:30:57,073 --> 02:30:58,893
TRAVIS: All right, I turn around and I leave.

1895
02:30:58,893 --> 02:30:59,526
MATT: Okay.

1896
02:30:59,526 --> 02:31:00,404
LIAM: Oh!

1897
02:31:00,404 --> 02:31:00,992
TRAVIS: Hi!

1898
02:31:00,992 --> 02:31:01,663
LIAM: Hey!

1899
02:31:01,663 --> 02:31:02,907
TRAVIS: Oh!

1900
02:31:02,907 --> 02:31:03,677
LIAM: There you are.

1901
02:31:03,677 --> 02:31:05,294
TRAVIS: Yes.

1902
02:31:05,294 --> 02:31:07,702
TRAVIS: Chased off a, uh, yup.

1903
02:31:07,702 --> 02:31:09,270
LIAM: What were you doing in there?

1904
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:10,975
TRAVIS: Securing the castle.

1905
02:31:10,975 --> 02:31:12,639
LIAM: In the dark room with nobody in it?

1906
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:17,964
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, there was a guy, right? And I
like, "Hey you, stop!"

1907
02:31:17,964 --> 02:31:22,928
and he was covered in this black powder and he 
just he gave me the slip.

1908
02:31:22,928 --> 02:31:23,978
LIAM: He ran out?

1909
02:31:23,978 --> 02:31:24,753
TRAVIS: Yup.

1910
02:31:24,753 --> 02:31:25,923
LIAM: That's who that was.

1911
02:31:25,923 --> 02:31:26,832
TRAVIS: You saw him!

1912
02:31:26,832 --> 02:31:27,398
LIAM: I did.

1913
02:31:27,398 --> 02:31:28,365
TRAVIS: Why'd you let him go?

1914
02:31:28,365 --> 02:31:28,961
LIAM: He's fast.

1915
02:31:28,961 --> 02:31:30,318
(all laugh)

1916
02:31:30,318 --> 02:31:33,800
LIAM: I don't like to get in between you and a
kill, Big Man.

1917
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:36,593
TRAVIS: I should go after him, then.

1918
02:31:36,593 --> 02:31:38,875
LIAM: You know, I just was looking
for you.

1919
02:31:38,875 --> 02:31:41,162
TRAVIS: Oh. I have a moment.

1920
02:31:41,162 --> 02:31:53,572
LIAM: Yeah. yeah. Ah, I just wanted to thank you 
for working your magic yesterday again.

1921
02:31:53,572 --> 02:31:54,285
TRAVIS: Me?

1922
02:31:54,285 --> 02:32:10,908
LIAM: Yeah. You saved him. You saved him. You did
good, Grog.

1923
02:32:10,908 --> 02:32:33,613
I'm proud of you. And, don't hurt me, I
love you. Thank you.

1924
02:32:33,613 --> 02:32:36,128
I slap him as hard as I
can.

1925
02:32:36,128 --> 02:32:36,996
MATT: (Echoing slap)

1926
02:32:36,996 --> 02:32:39,540
LIAM: And I use Disengage and I fucking run like
balls!

1927
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:49,340
(all laugh)

1928
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:54,252
MATT: He's gone. The sting fades.

1929
02:32:54,252 --> 02:32:58,609
TRAVIS: Huh. Okay.

1930
02:32:58,609 --> 02:33:01,998
(all awww)

1931
02:33:01,998 --> 02:33:03,961
MARISHA: So adorable.

1932
02:33:03,961 --> 02:33:08,508
MATT: All right, so you guys have checked
the keep, secured it, everything

1933
02:33:08,508 --> 02:33:18,285
seems in the right place given the circumstances,
what do you want to do?

1934
02:33:18,285 --> 02:33:20,283
MARISHA: What time is it?

1935
02:33:20,283 --> 02:33:24,499
MATT: At this point it's maybe early afternoon.

1936
02:33:24,499 --> 02:33:25,604
MARISHA: Oh, man.

1937
02:33:25,604 --> 02:33:28,306
LAURA: Should probably head out. Then I'm back,
right?

1938
02:33:28,306 --> 02:33:30,478
MATT: You've returned by the time that
they've gone through and checked the whole keep,

1939
02:33:30,478 --> 02:33:33,235
you made it to Allura and back. It's been a
couple hours in the Keep.

1940
02:33:33,235 --> 02:33:35,499
LAURA: Sweet.

1941
02:33:35,499 --> 02:33:41,128
MARISHA: So... we're just going to go bury ashes
in Vasselheim?

1942
02:33:41,128 --> 02:33:43,107
LAURA: Check one off the list.

1943
02:33:43,107 --> 02:33:44,097
TALIESIN: One a day.

1944
02:33:44,097 --> 02:33:47,311
MARISHA: No fighting?

1945
02:33:47,311 --> 02:33:48,020
TRAVIS: What?

1946
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:48,706
LAURA: In Vasselheim?

1947
02:33:48,706 --> 02:33:50,466
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not gonna get into any 
fights, right?

1948
02:33:50,466 --> 02:33:51,695
LIAM: Not if we can help it.

1949
02:33:51,695 --> 02:33:52,541
MARISHA: Okay.

1950
02:33:52,541 --> 02:33:53,373
TALIESIN: That's the hope.

1951
02:33:53,373 --> 02:33:56,375
MARISHA: Grog, why are you making that face,
Grog?

1952
02:33:56,375 --> 02:33:57,601
TRAVIS: I'm holding my breath.

1953
02:33:57,601 --> 02:33:59,548
LAURA and MARISHA: Why are you holding your
breath?

1954
02:33:59,548 --> 02:34:06,042
TRAVIS: Hiccups? No fights at all? Like, what if we run into
bad people?

1955
02:34:06,042 --> 02:34:09,019
MARISHA: If we run into bad people, we can fight
them.

1956
02:34:09,019 --> 02:34:14,083
TALIESIN: Can I roll a perception check on his
hands?

1957
02:34:14,083 --> 02:34:16,652
MATT: You know what, what's your passive
perception?

1958
02:34:16,652 --> 02:34:17,489
TALIESIN: 18.

1959
02:34:17,489 --> 02:34:19,501
TRAVIS: Don't make him roll-- make him roll for it.

1960
02:34:19,501 --> 02:34:25,017
(all laugh)

1961
02:34:25,017 --> 02:34:28,199
MATT: He was not actively looking, he
normally does not check for your hands, Grog, but

1962
02:34:28,199 --> 02:34:32,578
he's a perceptive guy and there is indeed a very
dark familiar residual--

1963
02:34:32,578 --> 02:34:33,693
MARISHA: Powder?

1964
02:34:33,693 --> 02:34:37,939
MATT: --on the hands, forearms, and a little bit on
the top of the cheek.

1965
02:34:37,939 --> 02:34:40,156
TALIESIN: Good to know.

1966
02:34:40,211 --> 02:34:43,582
LIAM: (laughs) It's like an eight-year-old with
chocolate across his face

1967
02:34:43,582 --> 02:34:44,591
(all laugh)

1968
02:34:44,591 --> 02:34:45,476
MATT: Kinda.

1969
02:34:45,476 --> 02:34:46,956
ASHLEY: I didn't get into it.

1970
02:34:46,956 --> 02:34:47,761
MARISHA: I didn't eat any.

1971
02:34:47,761 --> 02:34:50,460
TRAVIS: No unnecessary fights.

1972
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:51,873
MARISHA: No unnecessary fights.

1973
02:34:51,873 --> 02:34:52,634
TALIESIN: No.

1974
02:34:52,634 --> 02:34:53,292
MARISHA: Okay.

1975
02:34:53,292 --> 02:34:54,202
TRAVIS: Yup.

1976
02:34:54,202 --> 02:34:55,120
MARISHA: All right.

1977
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:57,133
LIAM: I mean, the crucible is there.

1978
02:34:57,133 --> 02:35:01,256
MARISHA: Well, that's not unnecessary.

1979
02:35:01,256 --> 02:35:04,814
ASHLEY: Wait, he said we can't open the box, 
right? Or did he say?

1980
02:35:04,814 --> 02:35:07,685
LAURA: He didn't say not to.

1981
02:35:07,685 --> 02:35:09,841
TALIESIN: Seems a bit disrespectful.

1982
02:35:09,841 --> 02:35:12,343
LAURA: He said it was his wife's ashes after all.

1983
02:35:12,343 --> 02:35:15,150
ASHLEY: I know, Okay.

1984
02:35:15,150 --> 02:35:17,011
TRAVIS: Why would you want to-- 
do you not like--

1985
02:35:17,011 --> 02:35:18,834
LAURA: Do you not trust it?

1986
02:35:18,834 --> 02:35:23,516
ASHLEY: No, I just wanna know for sure

1987
02:35:23,516 --> 02:35:27,826
MARISHA: Didn't we kinda look before?
We thought the same thing and it's--

1988
02:35:27,826 --> 02:35:29,559
LAURA: Did we look, though? Did we look--

1989
02:35:29,559 --> 02:35:31,262
MATT: I don't recall you looking in--

1990
02:35:31,262 --> 02:35:33,271
MARISHA: But didn't we do an insight
check and--

1991
02:35:33,271 --> 02:35:35,343
LAURA: And, I mean, I had Allura look at the box.

1992
02:35:35,343 --> 02:35:36,098
MARISHA: Right.

1993
02:35:36,098 --> 02:35:38,485
LAURA: She said it had a faint magical aura of protection.

1994
02:35:38,485 --> 02:35:40,003
MARISHA: But it was protection.

1995
02:35:40,003 --> 02:35:42,003
LIAM: Could you shake it like a yuletide present?

1996
02:35:42,003 --> 02:35:42,837
LAURA: No.

1997
02:35:42,837 --> 02:35:43,616
LIAM: No.

1998
02:35:43,616 --> 02:35:47,433
ASHLEY: Maybe it's actually somebody requesting
that we do something that is nice then,

1999
02:35:47,433 --> 02:35:49,121
which I feel like never happens.

2000
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:50,401
(all laughs)

2001
02:35:50,401 --> 02:35:53,844
MARISHA: From what I remember from my--
I can look, right?

2002
02:35:53,844 --> 02:35:55,006
ASHLEY: I don't trust anybody anymore.

2003
02:35:55,006 --> 02:35:56,533
MARISHA: From Senokir, cause didn't I do 
an insight check?

2004
02:35:56,533 --> 02:35:57,148
MATT: Yup.

2005
02:35:57,148 --> 02:35:59,126
TALIESIN: I would love the notion that the one
time that we actually follow through with this

2006
02:35:59,126 --> 02:36:02,179
very simple and basic thing that we aim to do and
just everything goes to shit.

2007
02:36:02,179 --> 02:36:04,477
MARISHA: We plant a seed of a demon spawn.

2008
02:36:04,477 --> 02:36:07,569
TALIESIN: Really lovely, very us.

2009
02:36:07,569 --> 02:36:11,296
TALIESIN: This time everybody goes to shit because
it's the one

2010
02:36:11,296 --> 02:36:14,905
purely altruistic thing that we do.

2011
02:36:14,905 --> 02:36:18,959
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on.

2012
02:36:18,959 --> 02:36:20,059
TALIESIN: My god, your notes.

2013
02:36:20,059 --> 02:36:21,350
MARISHA: Give me a second.

2014
02:36:21,350 --> 02:36:23,353
TALIESIN: No, these are amazing.

2015
02:36:23,353 --> 02:36:24,621
MARISHA: His wifes name was Zofin?

2016
02:36:24,621 --> 02:36:25,955
LAURA: Playing with those dice, are you?

2017
02:36:25,955 --> 02:36:27,219
MATT: I'm just turning dice over and
over again in my dice pile.

2018
02:36:27,219 --> 02:36:28,916
MARISHA: Senokir's wife was Zofin?

2019
02:36:28,916 --> 02:36:29,847
MATT: Zaafin.

2020
02:36:29,847 --> 02:36:31,404
MARISHA: Zaafin?

2021
02:36:31,404 --> 02:36:32,350
ASHLEY: Zofah.

2022
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:33,261
LIAM: So fine.

2023
02:36:33,261 --> 02:36:34,316
TRAVIS: Why don't you check it?

2024
02:36:34,316 --> 02:36:38,450
LAURA: So fiiine.

2025
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:40,764
MARISHA: Nope, that's all I got.

2026
02:36:40,764 --> 02:36:42,890
LAURA: If you want to do it, just do it.

2027
02:36:42,890 --> 02:36:44,257
MARISHA: I feel like I remember--

2028
02:36:44,257 --> 02:36:45,901
TRAVIS: It's your say, go for it.

2029
02:36:45,901 --> 02:36:50,548
TALIESIN: I think we should make a tree 
and head in that direction.

2030
02:36:50,548 --> 02:36:52,320
MARISHA: Well, we already have a tree, but yeah.

2031
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:54,067
TALIESIN: All in favor of jumping through that
tree--

2032
02:36:54,067 --> 02:36:57,717
MARISHA: Make like a leaf and wait--
Make like a tree and leave. (Laughs)

2033
02:36:57,717 --> 02:36:58,754
LAURA: Yeah.

2034
02:36:58,889 --> 02:37:00,192
TRAVIS: I don't know, ask him.

2035
02:37:00,192 --> 02:37:01,727
ASHLEY: Was the box already checked for traps?

2036
02:37:01,727 --> 02:37:04,183
MATT: You don't know.

2037
02:37:04,183 --> 02:37:05,761
ASHLEY: Can I check it for traps?

2038
02:37:05,761 --> 02:37:07,471
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2039
02:37:07,471 --> 02:37:08,112
ASHLEY: Okay.

2040
02:37:08,112 --> 02:37:09,071
TRAVIS: Do what you want, man.

2041
02:37:09,071 --> 02:37:10,722
LAURA: Should we scoot this forward a little bit?

2042
02:37:10,722 --> 02:37:16,324
MATT: As you guys are walking up, heading your way
up into the temple area with the singular tree

2043
02:37:16,324 --> 02:37:20,524
used for transportation before, Pike is just
holding and inspecting the box as you walk.

2044
02:37:20,524 --> 02:37:21,955
ASHLEY: I got an eight.

2045
02:37:21,955 --> 02:37:23,094
LAURA: What're you doing, Pike?

2046
02:37:23,094 --> 02:37:27,215
MATT: Eight? It's hard to tell, looks pretty safe.

2047
02:37:27,215 --> 02:37:28,737
LAURA: Do you not trust it?

2048
02:37:28,737 --> 02:37:30,941
ASHLEY: I just don't trust anybody anymore.

2049
02:37:30,941 --> 02:37:33,512
TRAVIS: Man, I know what that's like.

2050
02:37:33,512 --> 02:37:38,204
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm not good at--
Okay, let's go.

2051
02:37:38,204 --> 02:37:39,490
MATT: All right.

2052
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:40,767
ASHLEY: Let's go.

2053
02:37:40,767 --> 02:37:42,791
LIAM: What's on your mind?

2054
02:37:42,791 --> 02:37:45,114
ASHLEY: I just feel like this is something 
fishy about it,

2055
02:37:45,114 --> 02:37:49,599
it just seems too easy, you know?

2056
02:37:49,599 --> 02:37:50,833
LAURA: Too simple for us?

2057
02:37:50,833 --> 02:37:52,062
ASHLEY: Too simple.

2058
02:37:52,062 --> 02:37:55,605
ASHLEY: To just take a box and go bury it? Why
couldn't he do it?

2059
02:37:55,605 --> 02:37:57,370
I know we already talked about this.

2060
02:37:57,370 --> 02:37:59,838
MARISHA: Well wasn't he kind of stuck in the Fire
Plane--

2061
02:37:59,838 --> 02:38:01,539
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's not allowed.

2062
02:38:01,539 --> 02:38:02,227
MARISHA: Yeah.

2063
02:38:02,227 --> 02:38:02,868
ASHLEY: All right.

2064
02:38:02,868 --> 02:38:05,164
LAURA: He's not? He's not allowed? I don't
remember him saying that.

2065
02:38:05,164 --> 02:38:06,415
TRAVIS: I might have made that up.

2066
02:38:06,415 --> 02:38:08,714
(all laugh)

2067
02:38:08,714 --> 02:38:11,175
MATT: He said he had been intending to make a trip
to Vasselheim to bury it himself

2068
02:38:11,175 --> 02:38:13,187
but he hasn't had
the time or the ability to do so.

2069
02:38:13,187 --> 02:38:18,200
LAURA: Seems odd, right? I mean, it is his wife's
ashes.

2070
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:20,844
MARISHA: Oh man, you guys, I thought this was
something sweet

2071
02:38:20,844 --> 02:38:22,939
and we weren't gonna question it
and now we're making it complicated.

2072
02:38:22,939 --> 02:38:24,184
TRAVIS: You're right, yeah

2073
02:38:24,184 --> 02:38:25,669
TRAVIS: You're right. We're thinking too much.

2074
02:38:25,669 --> 02:38:27,442
LIAM: Are we saying there's no one in the world 
who's truthful? At all?

2075
02:38:27,442 --> 02:38:30,499
MARISHA: I don't know anymore. We're all too
scarred and damaged.

2076
02:38:30,499 --> 02:38:39,074
LAURA: Some people are truthful, but I mean 
Senokir did wanna make us his slaves--

2077
02:38:39,074 --> 02:38:43,198
MARISHA: We were all on board for this until 20
seconds ago when we started questioning it!

2078
02:38:43,198 --> 02:38:44,516
(all laugh)

2079
02:38:44,516 --> 02:38:48,528
ASHLEY: I'm sorry! I just-- (sighs)

2080
02:38:48,528 --> 02:38:50,331
LAURA: Pike could be saving our lives right now.

2081
02:38:50,331 --> 02:38:50,989
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2082
02:38:50,989 --> 02:38:52,506
ASHLEY: Or I could be killing all of us.

2083
02:38:52,506 --> 02:38:57,527
LIAM: Well, the bottom line is, he's probably
never gonna know if we take a peek.

2084
02:38:57,527 --> 02:38:58,836
ASHLEY: What if I just take a peek?

2085
02:38:58,836 --> 02:38:59,830
MARISHA: Vax!

2086
02:38:59,830 --> 02:39:01,973
TRAVIS: Oh wait, that's a good idea.

2087
02:39:01,973 --> 02:39:04,894
ASHLEY: Or like open it to a mirror.

2088
02:39:04,894 --> 02:39:05,957
LAURA: Ooh.

2089
02:39:05,957 --> 02:39:07,667
MARISHA: Are we taking a peek?

2090
02:39:07,667 --> 02:39:08,653
MARISHA: Or never doing it.

2091
02:39:08,653 --> 02:39:09,993
TRAVIS: I mean, she is quite holy right?

2092
02:39:09,993 --> 02:39:13,507
Like, if anyone was gonna look on those
sacred remains least it would be old stinker here.

2093
02:39:13,507 --> 02:39:17,303
LAURA: I mean, it does have a magical aura of
protection so it might be--

2094
02:39:17,303 --> 02:39:18,554
ASHLEY: It might hurt me.

2095
02:39:18,554 --> 02:39:19,275
MARISHA: It might backfire.

2096
02:39:19,275 --> 02:39:23,564
LIAM: I'm not gonna open it, can I look
at it? Can I look for locks or traps?

2097
02:39:23,564 --> 02:39:25,950
I'm not opening it.

2098
02:39:25,950 --> 02:39:26,868
MATT: Look for traps.

2099
02:39:26,868 --> 02:39:31,960
LIAM: Yeah? Oooh. That is a 22.

2100
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:37,399
MATT: 22. It is not trapped.

2101
02:39:37,399 --> 02:39:38,818
LIAM: And I don't know if it's locked.

2102
02:39:38,818 --> 02:39:41,926
MATT: Well, go ahead and make a roll 
to see if it's locked.

2103
02:39:41,926 --> 02:39:42,882
LIAM: Ooh.

2104
02:39:42,882 --> 02:39:43,763
LAURA: (laughs)

2105
02:39:43,763 --> 02:39:45,530
LIAM: That's even better, that's a 30.

2106
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:51,106
MATT: 30. It is locked, there are four individual
locks in each side--

2107
02:39:51,106 --> 02:39:52,035
LIAM: Four locks?

2108
02:39:52,035 --> 02:39:57,952
MATT: And it appears that there is some sort 
of a-- usually when something like that has a

2109
02:39:57,952 --> 02:40:02,279
little bit of give against the chain, the box has
none.

2110
02:40:02,279 --> 02:40:06,920
That usually either means it's adhered or
it's sealed magically.

2111
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:09,068
LIAM: Pickle, I will help you if you want,

2112
02:40:09,068 --> 02:40:12,467
but my gut is telling me that this is 
just his wife's ashes.

2113
02:40:12,467 --> 02:40:15,401
ASHLEY: Shake it. Listen.

2114
02:40:15,401 --> 02:40:18,654
TRAVIS: I second that.

2115
02:40:18,654 --> 02:40:20,351
MATT: Make a perception check.

2116
02:40:20,351 --> 02:40:21,890
LAURA: I put my hands up and walk a little bit
away.

2117
02:40:21,890 --> 02:40:24,831
LIAM: 30 again!

2118
02:40:24,831 --> 02:40:27,373
MATT: You hear what sounds like the very gentle
sifting of

2119
02:40:27,373 --> 02:40:31,094
some very, very light particles inside
of a box.

2120
02:40:31,094 --> 02:40:34,939
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I think he's telling us the
truth.

2121
02:40:34,939 --> 02:40:39,809
MARISHA: Vax, the Raven Queen is like your girl.

2122
02:40:39,809 --> 02:40:40,643
LIAM: Yeah.

2123
02:40:40,643 --> 02:40:44,949
MARISHA: Can you maybe, like, there is remains in
here--

2124
02:40:44,949 --> 02:40:46,642
LAURA: Can you both just ask, you know?

2125
02:40:46,642 --> 02:40:48,869
TRAVIS: Yeah, like, yo, is this the dead or--

2126
02:40:48,869 --> 02:40:58,953
MARISHA: Pike, you're a cleric, if you're that
concerned. Man, this is so extravagant, you guys.

2127
02:40:58,953 --> 02:41:00,763
TALIESIN: How paranoid has everybody gotten?

2128
02:41:00,763 --> 02:41:03,554
LIAM: I'm gonna use my paladin powers. There's
nothing undead in there, is there?

2129
02:41:03,554 --> 02:41:04,986
ASHLEY: Divine Intervention?

2130
02:41:04,986 --> 02:41:06,571
TALIESIN: Wow.

2131
02:41:06,571 --> 02:41:08,333
MATT: Okay, so you're using your--

2132
02:41:08,333 --> 02:41:09,302
LIAM: Divine Sense, yeah.

2133
02:41:09,302 --> 02:41:13,814
MATT: Divine Sense. You do not get a fiendish or
undead aura from the box.

2134
02:41:13,814 --> 02:41:17,538
LIAM: Yeah, man, this is just the guy's wife.

2135
02:41:17,538 --> 02:41:20,577
ASHLEY: What if we bury it and it turns into
something crazy?

2136
02:41:20,577 --> 02:41:22,520
TRAVIS: What have you been reading?

2137
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:23,940
ASHLEY: I don't know.

2138
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:25,178
MARISHA: When he told us it was his wife, we all
went,

2139
02:41:25,178 --> 02:41:29,276
awww, when that happened. And now we're
questioning it.

2140
02:41:29,276 --> 02:41:32,897
ASHLEY: But that's what a shyster does! You know?

2141
02:41:32,897 --> 02:41:34,578
LIAM: You're so hardened by the war.

2142
02:41:34,578 --> 02:41:38,384
ASHLEY: They tell you things to make you feel bad!
To buy their magazines!

2143
02:41:38,384 --> 02:41:41,138
(all laugh)

2144
02:41:41,138 --> 02:41:42,514
ASHLEY: You know?

2145
02:41:42,514 --> 02:41:44,402
TALIESIN: This is getting weirdly personal.

2146
02:41:44,402 --> 02:41:47,815
MARISHA: Who is trying to sell you magazine
subscriptions? Who?

2147
02:41:47,815 --> 02:41:49,264
ASHLEY: Just... everyone!

2148
02:41:49,264 --> 02:41:51,260
TALIESIN: What high schooler hurt you?

2149
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:54,762
LAURA: We just fought Raishan, I don't blame this.

2150
02:41:54,762 --> 02:41:55,847
LIAM: Pickle, Pickle, Pickle--

2151
02:41:55,847 --> 02:41:57,954
ASHLEY: Everyone in Whitestone. You guys haven't
been there long enough.

2152
02:41:57,954 --> 02:41:58,940
LIAM: Pickle, Pickle.

2153
02:41:58,940 --> 02:41:59,941
ASHLEY: Yes.

2154
02:41:59,941 --> 02:42:03,293
LIAM: There is a fucking tiger-faced demon who
wants both you and I dead.

2155
02:42:03,293 --> 02:42:07,404
We have bigger problems
than this man's wife's ashes.

2156
02:42:07,404 --> 02:42:08,830
MARISHA: Pike, we have to sail the ocean!

2157
02:42:08,830 --> 02:42:10,006
TALIESIN: People haven't sold you a subscription
to Highlights.

2158
02:42:10,006 --> 02:42:12,527
ASHLEY: I know. All right, let's go bury the, you
know.

2159
02:42:12,527 --> 02:42:13,567
LIAM: But you carry it.

2160
02:42:13,567 --> 02:42:14,498
ASHLEY: I'll carry it.

2161
02:42:14,498 --> 02:42:18,131
(all laugh)

2162
02:42:18,131 --> 02:42:23,788
ASHLEY: I pop it under my arm. Let's go.

2163
02:42:23,788 --> 02:42:25,601
MATT: Okay.

2164
02:42:25,601 --> 02:42:29,793
MARISHA: I just wanna let you know, I feel you.

2165
02:42:29,793 --> 02:42:31,460
ASHLEY: Okay.

2166
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:38,396
MARISHA: But I'm trying to make this our first
step into being a more positive Vox Machina.

2167
02:42:38,396 --> 02:42:39,627
ASHLEY: Okay.

2168
02:42:39,627 --> 02:42:41,509
TRAVIS: What's wrong with your face?

2169
02:42:41,509 --> 02:42:43,169
MARISHA: This is me forcing a smile.

2170
02:42:43,169 --> 02:42:45,655
TRAVIS: Oh.

2171
02:42:45,655 --> 02:42:48,664
MARISHA: There's pain under here. That's why it
looks like that.

2172
02:42:48,664 --> 02:42:49,270
TRAVIS: Right.

2173
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:50,650
LAURA: You're not supposed to say all those
things.

2174
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:53,767
MARISHA: Sorry. Oh, right, I'm supposed to hide
behind and bottle those emotions.

2175
02:42:53,767 --> 02:42:54,600
LAURA: Yeah.

2176
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:57,060
MARISHA: Right. No, things are great.

2177
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,635
LAURA: That's good, that's good, that's good.

2178
02:42:58,635 --> 02:43:01,032
MARISHA: Yeah, that's how normal people talk,
right? Things are great.

2179
02:43:01,032 --> 02:43:03,758
TRAVIS: We just bury it in the tree, that's it. In
the tree.

2180
02:43:03,758 --> 02:43:05,401
ASHLEY: No, we got her name, right?

2181
02:43:05,401 --> 02:43:06,432
MARISHA: Yes.

2182
02:43:06,432 --> 02:43:09,592
ASHLEY: So we'll make her a little tombstone,
we'll do a whole thing, then.

2183
02:43:09,592 --> 02:43:10,539
LAURA: Yeah.

2184
02:43:10,539 --> 02:43:12,383
LIAM: We'll do a whole thing, we'll bury the
ashes--

2185
02:43:12,383 --> 02:43:14,531
ASHLEY: We're gonna make it nice.

2186
02:43:14,531 --> 02:43:18,120
TALIESIN: I am genuinely worried about everybody.

2187
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:23,549
ASHLEY: Put Grasping Vines all over it.

2188
02:43:23,549 --> 02:43:25,039
TRAVIS: Bada-bing, bada-bam.

2189
02:43:25,039 --> 02:43:26,729
MATT: The Conclave arc has taken its toll on Vox
Machina.

2190
02:43:26,729 --> 02:43:30,254
(All laugh.)

2191
02:43:30,254 --> 02:43:33,998
MARISHA: We're all huddled around a box, just
like, freaking out right now.

2192
02:43:33,998 --> 02:43:37,827
LIAM: Vex just draws on that box.

2193
02:43:37,827 --> 02:43:46,490
TRAVIS: One little fucking box. Reveal your
secrets!

2194
02:43:46,490 --> 02:43:47,602
MATT: So, Keyleth.

2195
02:43:47,602 --> 02:43:49,377
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

2196
02:43:49,377 --> 02:43:50,494
ASHLEY: Let's go.

2197
02:43:50,494 --> 02:43:53,345
MATT: Okay, so what are you connecting to?

2198
02:43:53,345 --> 02:43:54,606
MARISHA: Huh? What?

2199
02:43:54,606 --> 02:43:55,813
TALIESIN: The other side of the tree.

2200
02:43:55,813 --> 02:43:58,953
MATT: The other side of the tree. Where are you
sending? You have many options at your disposal.

2201
02:43:58,953 --> 02:44:02,651
You have the outskirts of the city, there's the
lush forest, the Vesper Timberland.

2202
02:44:02,651 --> 02:44:04,259
MARISHA: He told us where to bury her, right?

2203
02:44:04,259 --> 02:44:05,918
MATT: He said the Abundant Terrace, which you have
passed by.

2204
02:44:05,918 --> 02:44:07,399
MARISHA: I have passed by?

2205
02:44:07,399 --> 02:44:08,299
MATT: Yeah.

2206
02:44:08,299 --> 02:44:11,732
LAURA: We should stick to the outside of the city,
right? Because of the magical laws there--

2207
02:44:11,732 --> 02:44:15,609
MATT: Well, the Abundant Terrace is a very heavily
wooded area.

2208
02:44:15,609 --> 02:44:17,686
MARISHA: On the outskirts.

2209
02:44:17,686 --> 02:44:21,015
MATT: And the magical laws are more about rampant
arcane casting.

2210
02:44:21,015 --> 02:44:27,469
Divination and divine magics
generally fall more into the territory of respect

2211
02:44:27,469 --> 02:44:31,503
as long as they're relatively controlled and not a
grand display of power.

2212
02:44:31,503 --> 02:44:32,781
LAURA: Solid.

2213
02:44:32,781 --> 02:44:35,499
MARISHA: So the Abundant Terrace is a forest on
the outskirts of the town?

2214
02:44:35,499 --> 02:44:38,368
MATT: The Abundant Terrace is Melora's section of
the city.

2215
02:44:38,368 --> 02:44:39,343
LAURA: Melora!

2216
02:44:39,343 --> 02:44:40,763
MARISHA: Oh, right, right, right.

2217
02:44:40,763 --> 02:44:46,323
MATT: It's where-- it's a district that has
maintained magical fertility for growing crops and

2218
02:44:46,323 --> 02:44:51,814
plants and it's basically where a lot of the food
for Vasselheim is grown.

2219
02:44:51,814 --> 02:44:57,452
MARISHA: Oh, perfect. Farming district. Okay. Is
there a tree there?

2220
02:44:57,452 --> 02:45:03,238
MATT: There are a number of trees, actually. A
number of the homes are actually built in--

2221
02:45:03,238 --> 02:45:04,724
MARISHA: In trees? That's cool.

2222
02:45:04,724 --> 02:45:05,646
LIAM: Sick!

2223
02:45:05,646 --> 02:45:08,648
MARISHA: I want a tree house! Okay.

2224
02:45:08,648 --> 02:45:16,722
And you said it's safe, this isn't arcane, 
it's natural, since Melora, I'll probably be okay?

2225
02:45:16,722 --> 02:45:20,438
People aren't gonna look at us weird when
we come out of a tree on the other end?

2226
02:45:20,438 --> 02:45:22,332
MATT: I mean, when you come out of a tree people
probably look at you weird anyway.

2227
02:45:22,332 --> 02:45:23,418
MARISHA: Sure.

2228
02:45:23,418 --> 02:45:25,169
ASHLEY: Do people bury their dead here?

2229
02:45:25,169 --> 02:45:30,113
MATT: You don't know. Roll a history check.

2230
02:45:30,113 --> 02:45:35,080
LAURA: But didn't he say that she was from this
area?

2231
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:36,911
TALIESIN: I'll join in this history check, this is
bothering me.

2232
02:45:36,911 --> 02:45:39,303
MARISHA: Sofine? Sofin?

2233
02:45:39,303 --> 02:45:40,049
MATT: Zaafin.

2234
02:45:40,049 --> 02:45:41,280
LAURA and MARISHA: Zaafin.

2235
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,320
LAURA: Zaafin was from this area?

2236
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:46,441
MATT: Apparently, yes, this was where she came
from.

2237
02:45:46,441 --> 02:45:49,175
ASHLEY: We both did a history check. 15.

2238
02:45:49,175 --> 02:45:50,229
TALIESIN: 26.

2239
02:45:50,229 --> 02:45:52,066
ASHLEY: Well, there you go.

2240
02:45:52,066 --> 02:46:00,314
MATT: Okay. I mean, usually the dead are interred
in specific graveyards.

2241
02:46:00,314 --> 02:46:04,778
Some people do prefer to have their ashes spread 
in places that were important to them, it's just a

2242
02:46:04,778 --> 02:46:11,438
general request, but the Birth Heart or the 
Abundant Terrace are not areas that are

2243
02:46:11,438 --> 02:46:17,884
designated for interring the dead. So 
it is a special request.

2244
02:46:17,884 --> 02:46:19,855
LAURA: Okay, I have a thought.

2245
02:46:19,855 --> 02:46:21,347
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2246
02:46:21,347 --> 02:46:26,277
LAURA: What if we do bury this where he's asked,

2247
02:46:26,277 --> 02:46:32,775
but we put it inside of something that deters
magic?

2248
02:46:32,775 --> 02:46:34,564
TRAVIS and LIAM: Like what?

2249
02:46:34,564 --> 02:46:39,984
LAURA: I don't know. Like a fine container or
something. It was just a thought. Isn't there

2250
02:46:39,984 --> 02:46:46,320
things like that? Like a chest or something that
dispels magic so that if he is trying to do

2251
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:50,698
something nefarious, then we keep him from doing
that.

2252
02:46:50,698 --> 02:46:53,166
LIAM: You want to go find an arcane shop--

2253
02:46:53,166 --> 02:46:54,166
ASHLEY: Like a container store.

2254
02:46:54,166 --> 02:46:55,887
LIAM: -- find a very expensive container...

2255
02:46:55,887 --> 02:46:58,598
TRAVIS: This seems really out of the way for what
is a simple burial.

2256
02:46:58,598 --> 02:47:03,508
TALIESIN: How about we just ask a few questions to
see if anyone remembers his wife?

2257
02:47:03,508 --> 02:47:04,170
LAURA: Good call.

2258
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:05,496
TRAVIS: Hey! Yes.

2259
02:47:05,496 --> 02:47:06,195
LAURA: I like it.

2260
02:47:06,195 --> 02:47:08,654
TALIESIN: Maybe she left some sort of connection
to this place.

2261
02:47:08,654 --> 02:47:11,689
LAURA: Could you cast Speak with the Dead on
ashes?

2262
02:47:11,689 --> 02:47:13,119
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2263
02:47:13,119 --> 02:47:15,284
TALIESIN: Yes, but they just say shkshkshkshk.

2264
02:47:15,284 --> 02:47:19,124
(all laugh)

2265
02:47:19,124 --> 02:47:20,365
MARISHA: That's probably true.

2266
02:47:20,365 --> 02:47:21,606
TRAVIS: Like baby powder.

2267
02:47:21,606 --> 02:47:27,304
LIAM: We saved the world, but we are still a bunch
of assholes.

2268
02:47:27,304 --> 02:47:29,168
MATT: A corpse still requires a mouth to speak.

2269
02:47:29,168 --> 02:47:30,821
TRAVIS: Let's get over there.

2270
02:47:30,821 --> 02:47:33,880
MARISHA: (laughs) We saved the world, but we're
still a bunch of assholes.

2271
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:36,557
MATT: It doesn't work. All right, so. Keyleth,
what--

2272
02:47:36,557 --> 02:47:38,060
TRAVIS: The wondrous sand doesn't come up?

2273
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:39,599
MARISHA: What am I doing?

2274
02:47:39,599 --> 02:47:42,309
MATT: Are you going to come popping out within the
city? Abundant Terrace?

2275
02:47:42,309 --> 02:47:43,226
LAURA: Abundant Terrace.

2276
02:47:43,226 --> 02:47:44,138
ASHLEY: Yeah, Abundant Terrace.

2277
02:47:44,138 --> 02:47:45,306
MARISHA: Abundant Terrace, ho!

2278
02:47:45,306 --> 02:47:46,090
MATT: All right.

2279
02:47:46,090 --> 02:47:47,129
ASHLEY: We'll decide when we get there.

2280
02:47:47,129 --> 02:47:48,647
MATT: The tree-- (laughs)

2281
02:47:48,647 --> 02:47:50,179
MARISHA: We'll have six seconds to think about it.

2282
02:47:50,179 --> 02:47:52,052
LAURA: Be an idiot!

2283
02:47:52,052 --> 02:47:58,203
MATT: The tree shreds open into the familiar oval
or diamond-shaped entryway. On the opposite side,

2284
02:47:58,203 --> 02:48:04,273
you see the cold landscape, or at least the cold
sky of Vasselheim, though surrounding you it is

2285
02:48:04,273 --> 02:48:09,331
just verdant green. You can see moss and bushes
and grass, and a number of tree trunks around you.

2286
02:48:09,331 --> 02:48:16,833
You can see a very clear-cut path that walks
through like an intentional park walkway. As you

2287
02:48:16,833 --> 02:48:23,676
all emerge, you find yourself looking up into the
relatively grey, heavily cloud-covered sky, and it

2288
02:48:23,676 --> 02:48:31,974
is very cold. You watch as very, very faint snow
drifts to the ground, but it doesn't touch, it

2289
02:48:31,974 --> 02:48:37,419
immediately evaporates before it hits the ground.
It seems either the warmth of the area or an

2290
02:48:37,419 --> 02:48:42,765
enchantment of some kind is resistant to the
weather of this northern continent.

2291
02:48:42,765 --> 02:48:48,811
MARISHA: Can I do a quick nature check to see if
this is a mystical realm

2292
02:48:48,811 --> 02:48:51,748
or if they've done
something naturey to make it--

2293
02:48:51,748 --> 02:48:57,446
MATT: Nature check.

2294
02:48:57,446 --> 02:48:58,226
MARISHA: 22.

2295
02:48:58,226 --> 02:49:09,178
MATT: 22. The snow would usually touch the ground,
and then slowly turn to water and melt, if it was

2296
02:49:09,178 --> 02:49:13,952
just a difference between the ground. However, the
snow never reaches within a foot, it just kind of

2297
02:49:13,952 --> 02:49:19,930
drifts and then (poof). So it does appear to be an
enchantment or some sort of magical essence to the

2298
02:49:19,930 --> 02:49:27,744
Abundant Terrace itself. But you are surrounded by
a forest that has very beautifully kept walkways

2299
02:49:27,744 --> 02:49:32,390
in a grid-type pattern. You do see some people
that are walking through, a couple hand-in-hand,

2300
02:49:32,390 --> 02:49:40,332
almost like they're just on a stroll, bunched furs
around their shoulders. You can see a little ways

2301
02:49:40,332 --> 02:49:45,764
down, the trees stop, and it opens up into what
looks to be an expanse of farmland, rows and rows

2302
02:49:45,764 --> 02:49:55,036
and rows of various crops that are perpetually
being planted, pulled up, and harvested. There is

2303
02:49:55,036 --> 02:49:58,710
no harvest season in Vasselheim because of the
enchantment of the Abundant Terrace.

2304
02:49:58,710 --> 02:50:01,569
It is perpetually fertile and bearing--

2305
02:50:01,569 --> 02:50:02,336
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

2306
02:50:02,336 --> 02:50:04,947
LAURA: Wow.

2307
02:50:04,947 --> 02:50:10,315
MATT: You haven't done a full pass of this area,
but it's not densely populated.

2308
02:50:10,315 --> 02:50:17,705
What people come here either are working the 
land, keeping the land, or are enjoying the

2309
02:50:17,705 --> 02:50:27,768
change in scenery from the rest of what can 
be sometimes a more, I guess you would say,

2310
02:50:27,768 --> 02:50:37,176
grey and expressionless landscape that some 
parts of the city tend to hold.

2311
02:50:37,176 --> 02:50:40,567
But here you are at the Abundant Terrace. 
What do you want to do?

2312
02:50:40,567 --> 02:50:48,012
MARISHA: I remember he said he wanted us to plant
the box under a tree.

2313
02:50:48,012 --> 02:50:50,995
MATT: He said to bury it beneath the Birth Heart
in the Abundant Terrace.

2314
02:50:50,995 --> 02:50:52,602
MARISHA: The Birth Heart.

2315
02:50:52,602 --> 02:50:54,026
LIAM: That is not a random tree.

2316
02:50:54,026 --> 02:50:55,861
LAURA: Is that couple pretty close?

2317
02:50:55,861 --> 02:51:01,431
MATT: Yeah, they kinda walk by and look over. They
both appear to be human, the woman with darker

2318
02:51:01,431 --> 02:51:07,529
hair, it's braided and pulled around to one side.
The man's a little older, dark beard that kinda

2319
02:51:07,529 --> 02:51:13,181
goes to grey around the mustache and the chin,
dark hair that's slicked back and it's kinda long

2320
02:51:13,181 --> 02:51:16,767
in the back. Both have their furs around their
shoulders, and she has her arm around his arm and

2321
02:51:16,767 --> 02:51:22,132
they just walk past, and glance back at you with
a, huh, they just walked out of a tree.

2322
02:51:22,132 --> 02:51:23,079
ASHLEY: Hello.

2323
02:51:23,079 --> 02:51:24,426
MARISHA: Hi.

2324
02:51:24,426 --> 02:51:25,421
MATT: Hello.

2325
02:51:25,421 --> 02:51:31,708
ASHLEY: Do you-- do you guys live here, or are you
just passing through, or checking out the town?

2326
02:51:31,708 --> 02:51:35,549
MATT: We live in the Quad Roads, we're just out
here for a walk.

2327
02:51:35,549 --> 02:51:48,415
ASHLEY: Beautiful place. Do you-- do you happen to
know, or knew of someone named, uh, Zaafin.

2328
02:51:48,415 --> 02:51:51,446
MATT: "Zaafin?"

2329
02:51:51,446 --> 02:51:54,191
He turns to his companion, she
looks up.

2330
02:51:54,191 --> 02:51:57,693
"No, I don't recall anyone named Zaafin,
I'm sorry."

2331
02:51:57,693 --> 02:52:04,449
"I do not either, my apologies. Good
day."

2332
02:52:04,449 --> 02:52:06,592
They awkwardly continue walking.

2333
02:52:06,592 --> 02:52:08,272
MARISHA: Ask them where the Birth Heart tree is!

2334
02:52:08,272 --> 02:52:10,507
ASHLEY: Do you know where the Birth Heart tree is,
actually?

2335
02:52:10,507 --> 02:52:12,258
MATT: She stops and turns back.

2336
02:52:12,258 --> 02:52:17,994
"The Birth Heart is two paths up and to 
the right. It's hard to miss."

2337
02:52:17,994 --> 02:52:20,504
ASHLEY: How long have you guys lived here?

2338
02:52:20,504 --> 02:52:24,947
MATT: They kinda look at each other, back at you,
awkwardly.

2339
02:52:24,947 --> 02:52:30,538
"My entire life. She lived up north in
Crossin but moved here ten years ago."

2340
02:52:30,772 --> 02:52:33,495
ASHLEY: And you've never heard of a Zaafin?

2341
02:52:33,495 --> 02:52:34,826
MATT: No.

2342
02:52:34,826 --> 02:52:36,289
ASHLEY: Insight check?

2343
02:52:36,289 --> 02:52:42,122
MATT: Yes, make an insight check.

2344
02:52:42,122 --> 02:52:43,499
ASHLEY: 24.

2345
02:52:43,499 --> 02:52:45,231
MATT: 24.

2346
02:52:45,231 --> 02:52:46,776
ASHLEY: I get a whisper?

2347
02:52:46,776 --> 02:52:48,753
MARISHA: Whispers!

2348
02:52:48,753 --> 02:52:50,724
TALIESIN: If you wanna help build tension,

2349
02:52:50,724 --> 02:52:53,783
Lootcrate will help you build a lot of things
today. Oh, stop it.

2350
02:52:53,783 --> 02:52:55,295
MARISHA: With their next theme.

2351
02:52:55,295 --> 02:52:56,618
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Build.

2352
02:52:56,618 --> 02:52:58,547
TALIESIN: Build suspense. Build character.

2353
02:52:58,547 --> 02:53:00,312
MARISHA: Build tension. Build stress.

2354
02:53:00,312 --> 02:53:01,983
LAURA: Do you feel powerful when you go-- yeah?

2355
02:53:01,983 --> 02:53:07,653
MARISHA: Yes, build anxiety disorders.

2356
02:53:07,653 --> 02:53:09,195
LAURA: Did you just hijack her Twitter?

2357
02:53:09,195 --> 02:53:11,401
LIAM: No.

2358
02:53:11,401 --> 02:53:17,649
TALIESIN: (laughs) Sorry. Shit.

2359
02:53:17,649 --> 02:53:18,871
MATT: Well done.

2360
02:53:18,871 --> 02:53:22,711
ASHLEY: Thank you. Thank you very much for
stopping and talking with us.

2361
02:53:22,711 --> 02:53:24,381
MATT: "Of course."

2362
02:53:24,381 --> 02:53:30,442
And they continue their path, quicken their pace 
a bit, hoping to avoid any future questions.

2363
02:53:30,442 --> 02:53:39,030
ASHLEY: They have no idea who she is. They just
wanted to be on their way.

2364
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:42,373
TRAVIS: Why is it called the Birth Heart tree?

2365
02:53:42,373 --> 02:53:48,029
MARISHA: I guess we'll find out. They said we
couldn't miss it.

2366
02:53:48,029 --> 02:53:49,491
TRAVIS: All right, let's go find it.

2367
02:53:49,491 --> 02:53:50,696
MARISHA: All right.

2368
02:53:50,696 --> 02:53:53,062
MATT: All right, you follow their instructions,
which involves you guys

2369
02:53:53,062 --> 02:53:57,264
now following them about
40 feet back and they notice you.

2370
02:53:57,264 --> 02:53:59,488
MARISHA: We're trying to do that thing where it's
not like

2371
02:53:59,488 --> 02:54:01,782
you're walking to your car after you've
already said goodbye.

2372
02:54:01,782 --> 02:54:02,848
MATT: Okay, so you hold back a bit.

2373
02:54:02,848 --> 02:54:03,813
MARISHA: Yeah.

2374
02:54:03,813 --> 02:54:09,569
MATT: They eventually turn the opposite direction.
Following instructions, you go up two paths and to

2375
02:54:09,569 --> 02:54:19,686
the right, and you can see now-- amongst what is
a fair number of, I'd say 20-foot-tall trees that

2376
02:54:19,686 --> 02:54:25,690
you've come across in this area, there is a large
domed cluster of trees, almost like a redwood

2377
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:35,161
forest dome of 100-foot-tall trees. This one, it
looks like Lothlorien in the distance.

2378
02:54:35,161 --> 02:54:40,164
You have regular forest and this giant bump in 
the canopy.

2379
02:54:40,164 --> 02:54:43,378
And you get the sense that's probably the Birth
Heart.

2380
02:54:43,378 --> 02:54:48,657
LAURA: Does it kind of remind us of Sondur's tree?

2381
02:54:48,657 --> 02:54:50,903
MATT: Sondur was a singular tree.

2382
02:54:50,903 --> 02:54:54,189
This, from what you can tell, appears 
to be a cluster of many trees.

2383
02:54:54,189 --> 02:54:58,856
LAURA: Okay.

2384
02:54:58,856 --> 02:55:00,931
TRAVIS: Do we proceed towards it?

2385
02:55:00,931 --> 02:55:02,203
MARISHA: Yeah, we do.

2386
02:55:02,203 --> 02:55:03,242
LIAM: Yes, yes.

2387
02:55:03,242 --> 02:55:05,927
MATT: All right. You guys push on, and as you
approach--

2388
02:55:05,927 --> 02:55:09,318
TRAVIS: Can we keep an eye out for guards? Anybody
that might be watching us?

2389
02:55:09,318 --> 02:55:11,222
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

2390
02:55:11,222 --> 02:55:12,088
TRAVIS: Me?

2391
02:55:12,088 --> 02:55:14,321
MATT: Yes, you. He who asks.

2392
02:55:14,321 --> 02:55:22,253
TRAVIS: He who asks rolls a ten.

2393
02:55:22,253 --> 02:55:30,482
MATT: Okay. As you walk, you see a handful of
guards that just occasionally wander through.

2394
02:55:30,482 --> 02:55:39,749
The Bastions wear patchwork armor, there isn't a
standard Bastion armor set, per se, but they do

2395
02:55:39,749 --> 02:55:48,628
have elements of colors and cloths that symbolize
their station as well as some pins or badges that

2396
02:55:48,628 --> 02:55:53,099
mark the symbol there. So you do pick up on a few
of them, and they're just kind of doing the

2397
02:55:53,099 --> 02:55:58,134
rounds, and there are a couple that are curiously
keeping their distance and keeping an eye.

2398
02:55:58,134 --> 02:56:00,568
But not following you, just, hm.

2399
02:56:00,568 --> 02:56:02,433
TRAVIS: Bidet.

2400
02:56:02,433 --> 02:56:06,048
MATT: Bidet?

2401
02:56:06,048 --> 02:56:09,854
LAURA: Can I keep an eye out for any kind of
tombstones or

2402
02:56:09,854 --> 02:56:12,976
anything in the area that looks like
anybody else might have done similar things?

2403
02:56:12,976 --> 02:56:16,135
MATT: Sure. Perception check.

2404
02:56:16,135 --> 02:56:20,720
LAURA: Oh, is it at advantage because we're in a
forest?

2405
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:22,988
MATT: (defeated) Technically, yes.

2406
02:56:22,988 --> 02:56:30,131
TALIESIN: That was the saddest advantage I've ever
seen.

2407
02:56:30,131 --> 02:56:31,321
LAURA: Perception, you said?

2408
02:56:31,321 --> 02:56:32,105
MATT: Yes.

2409
02:56:32,105 --> 02:56:33,249
LAURA: That's a 20.

2410
02:56:33,249 --> 02:56:37,689
MATT: Okay. As you walk towards the Birth Heart,
and you get towards the outside of this large

2411
02:56:37,689 --> 02:56:45,074
cluster of towering trees, you do not see anything
that would be a tombstone per se.

2412
02:56:45,074 --> 02:56:48,635
Occasionally you do see a cluster of stones.

2413
02:56:48,635 --> 02:56:51,273
LAURA: Can I check 'em out and see if it looks
like--

2414
02:56:51,273 --> 02:57:00,715
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.

2415
02:57:00,715 --> 02:57:01,636
LAURA: What?

2416
02:57:01,636 --> 02:57:02,799
TRAVIS: Why's your binder closed?

2417
02:57:02,799 --> 02:57:09,053
LAURA: Well, I'm trying to take up less space
'cause we, you know? What was the first one?

2418
02:57:09,053 --> 02:57:10,551
LIAM: Eight. They were both dogshit.

2419
02:57:10,551 --> 02:57:11,436
LAURA: 15.

2420
02:57:11,436 --> 02:57:12,924
MATT: 15, okay.

2421
02:57:12,924 --> 02:57:14,822
LAURA: Shut up.

2422
02:57:14,822 --> 02:57:19,567
MATT: Looking at the rocks that are here, there
are not a lot of errant stones here.

2423
02:57:19,567 --> 02:57:31,195
Some occasional natural stones, but there is a 
thick kind of naturally composting pine and

2424
02:57:31,195 --> 02:57:36,434
leaves that fall on this area that regenerate the 
cycle of fertility here as part of the

2425
02:57:36,434 --> 02:57:41,020
enchantment. These stones are deliberately 
placed and are placed in a circular pattern

2426
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:44,676
with a pile in the center. It does appear to be 
a marking of some kind.

2427
02:57:44,676 --> 02:57:47,857
LAURA: All right.

2428
02:57:47,857 --> 02:57:49,274
TRAVIS: What's that?

2429
02:57:49,274 --> 02:57:52,139
LAURA: I don't know. It looks like it could be a
marker,

2430
02:57:52,139 --> 02:57:55,478
a tombstone, memorial, something like
that.

2431
02:57:55,478 --> 02:57:57,360
TRAVIS: Do we have to make one that looks like
that?

2432
02:57:57,360 --> 02:58:00,307
LAURA: We could.

2433
02:58:00,307 --> 02:58:02,983
TRAVIS: Okay.

2434
02:58:02,983 --> 02:58:08,876
LIAM: Is it in the exact center of this big area
of the trees?

2435
02:58:08,876 --> 02:58:12,382
MATT: You're unable to see from this perspective,
you don't have an aerial view.

2436
02:58:12,382 --> 02:58:17,468
LIAM: Oh, all right. But I mean, is it deep in or
is it just as we come in?

2437
02:58:17,468 --> 02:58:21,081
MATT: It's not terribly deep. If you guys have
reached the outside of the Birth Heart, you've

2438
02:58:21,081 --> 02:58:27,313
been walking for maybe ten minutes, it's not,
you're not entirely certain how far you are from

2439
02:58:27,313 --> 02:58:31,845
the outskirts of the Abundant Terrace. You haven't
really walked through it before, you've seen it

2440
02:58:31,845 --> 02:58:38,606
from a distance. Keyleth did one pass on it when
you first came to Vasselheim for the second time.

2441
02:58:38,606 --> 02:58:40,892
You really have no idea where you are within the
city.

2442
02:58:40,892 --> 02:58:48,330
LIAM: Do I get a vibe off of it, like it's a place
where others have been buried before?

2443
02:58:48,330 --> 02:58:54,386
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

2444
02:58:54,386 --> 02:58:57,689
LIAM: I'll use Luck.

2445
02:58:57,689 --> 02:58:59,143
LAURA: That's cocked, that's cocked.

2446
02:58:59,143 --> 02:58:59,700
LIAM: Sure.

2447
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:00,955
MATT: Nope.

2448
02:59:00,955 --> 02:59:04,442
LIAM: All right. It was a tiny bit. Eight.

2449
02:59:04,442 --> 02:59:06,413
MATT: If you can read the number, it's not.

2450
02:59:06,413 --> 02:59:07,632
LAURA: Okay.

2451
02:59:07,632 --> 02:59:12,448
LIAM: What does it say?

2452
02:59:12,448 --> 02:59:20,535
MATT: Yeah, you get the sense, I mean, it's
awe-inspiring to be in this giant canopy of trees.

2453
02:59:20,535 --> 02:59:26,448
It's hard to tell from this distance, but it's
probably hundreds of feet across from end to end,

2454
02:59:26,448 --> 02:59:32,025
and it's beautiful. There is, once again you can
see trees up on the mountain that Vasselheim is

2455
02:59:32,025 --> 02:59:37,923
built on the base of, and you can see distant
clusters of pine that are all covered in snow.

2456
02:59:37,923 --> 02:59:43,701
There should be snowfall on these trees to a
certain extent, ice gathering at some point in the

2457
02:59:43,701 --> 02:59:49,123
boughs, and it is just verdant green, untouched by
frost or snow.

2458
02:59:49,123 --> 02:59:53,775
MARISHA: Does there seem to be one central tree in
the center of all this, or just a massive--

2459
02:59:53,775 --> 02:59:56,930
MATT: It's hard to tell from this outside. You'd
have to walk into the Birth Heart to see.

2460
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:57,956
LAURA: Let's do it.

2461
02:59:57,956 --> 03:00:01,499
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought we already
were doing that.

2462
03:00:01,499 --> 03:00:06,112
MATT: As you enter the Birth Heart, it's an
archway of branches and trees that knit into each

2463
03:00:06,112 --> 03:00:13,795
other and wrap around as you step in. You can see
what looks like a heavy cluster of forest is

2464
03:00:13,795 --> 03:00:22,485
really just an outside row of trees that are all
intertwined. The inside is open with the

2465
03:00:22,485 --> 03:00:27,380
occasional stalk of tree that blossoms up into the
higher portion.

2466
03:00:27,380 --> 03:00:32,024
There is one large central tree in
the center of the area that marks--

2467
03:00:32,024 --> 03:00:33,483
MARISHA: The Birth Heart.

2468
03:00:33,483 --> 03:00:35,875
MATT: This is the center of the Birth Heart.

2469
03:00:35,875 --> 03:00:40,441
And within there are a number of lanterns 
that are hung from the branches all throughout--

2470
03:00:40,441 --> 03:00:42,746
LAURA: It's beautiful!

2471
03:00:42,746 --> 03:00:45,302
MATT:  -- that all have their own yellowish fairy
glow within each point.

2472
03:00:45,302 --> 03:00:47,735
They're all through the inside at different levels.

2473
03:00:47,793 --> 03:00:49,055
MARISHA: Shut up, don't judge us!

2474
03:00:49,055 --> 03:00:51,780
MATT: It's just hundreds and hundreds of these
yellow glowing lights that are hooked up into the

2475
03:00:51,780 --> 03:01:04,834
boughs ahead. There are a number of people walking
off the path, just through the soft mulch wood and

2476
03:01:04,834 --> 03:01:12,656
dying pine soft floor of the canopy, all wearing
similar robes of greens and yellows, golds and

2477
03:01:12,656 --> 03:01:18,570
whites. You recognize these as similar signs of
followers, priests--

2478
03:01:18,570 --> 03:01:19,689
MARISHA: Of Melora?

2479
03:01:19,689 --> 03:01:21,604
MATT: -- and people who are worshipers of Melora.

2480
03:01:21,604 --> 03:01:23,408
MARISHA: Oh shit, all right.

2481
03:01:23,408 --> 03:01:28,034
MATT: The central tree does have a number of
staircases that spiral up. At certain points there

2482
03:01:28,034 --> 03:01:37,418
look to be windows and holes throughout. The
inside gives a warm glow from the interior and you

2483
03:01:37,418 --> 03:01:42,032
can already see dozens of people gathered around
the outside at tables talking.

2484
03:01:42,032 --> 03:01:44,289
TRAVIS: (whispering) It's a cafe.

2485
03:01:44,289 --> 03:01:45,821
MATT: (laughs) There's no cafe, necessarily.

2486
03:01:45,821 --> 03:01:47,165
(all laugh)

2487
03:01:47,165 --> 03:01:48,773
LIAM: But there is a gift shop!

2488
03:01:48,773 --> 03:01:50,678
MARISHA: There's a Starbucks!

2489
03:01:50,678 --> 03:01:53,895
MATT: But there is a surprisingly-- I won't say
vibrant social atmosphere, but there are places

2490
03:01:53,895 --> 03:01:57,101
where people are congregating here to have soft
conversations.

2491
03:01:57,101 --> 03:01:58,672
LAURA: Are they all holy or is this like--

2492
03:01:58,672 --> 03:01:59,751
MATT: Some of them are, some of them aren't.

2493
03:01:59,751 --> 03:02:00,644
LAURA: Okay.

2494
03:02:00,644 --> 03:02:05,153
MATT: It's a smattering of individuals.

2495
03:02:05,153 --> 03:02:06,697
LAURA:  This is beautiful!

2496
03:02:06,697 --> 03:02:08,813
MARISHA: I know! This is so romantical!

2497
03:02:08,813 --> 03:02:12,054
TRAVIS: (mimics throwing up)

2498
03:02:12,054 --> 03:02:19,138
MARISHA: I go up to one of the worshipers of
Melora.

2499
03:02:19,138 --> 03:02:31,629
MATT: Okay. There is an older woman, her hair
starts red and goes to grey. Best you can tell,

2500
03:02:31,629 --> 03:02:39,115
her heritage is human, but she is a little thicker
and more muscular than most women of her age that

2501
03:02:39,115 --> 03:02:51,054
you've come across. Her skin is weathered from
sunlight and harsh seasons, but she smiles as you

2502
03:02:51,054 --> 03:02:59,282
approach and her eyes, one looks to be a little
cataract-ridden but the other one is a beautiful

2503
03:02:59,282 --> 03:03:06,003
clear blue color, and both of them meet with yours
as you approach and she smiles.

2504
03:03:06,003 --> 03:03:08,464
"Ah, can I help you?"

2505
03:03:08,464 --> 03:03:13,492
MARISHA: Oh hello, I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari.
What's your name?

2506
03:03:13,492 --> 03:03:15,511
MATT: Lamor. It's nice to meet you.

2507
03:03:15,511 --> 03:03:21,819
MARISHA: Lamor, pleasure to meet you. I was just
curious-- Lamor?

2508
03:03:21,819 --> 03:03:23,109
MATT: Yes, Lamor.

2509
03:03:23,109 --> 03:03:24,194
MARISHA: I want to write this down before I
forget.

2510
03:03:24,194 --> 03:03:25,225
MATT: L a m o r.

2511
03:03:25,225 --> 03:03:26,007
MARISHA: Uh what?

2512
03:03:26,007 --> 03:03:27,878
MATT: L a m o r.

2513
03:03:27,878 --> 03:03:41,182
MARISHA: L a m o r. Okay. I was just curious. We
are here to pay our respects and to do a favor for

2514
03:03:41,182 --> 03:03:49,605
a friend and bury his fallen wife. Is there a
specific place where we can do that and spread the

2515
03:03:49,605 --> 03:04:00,099
ashes in a respectful manner. Below the Birth
Heart tree? I just don't want disturb the grounds.

2516
03:04:00,099 --> 03:04:09,326
MATT: I mean, to return to the earth is a sacred
offering. From what you were given life is to give

2517
03:04:09,326 --> 03:04:18,925
life once more. You would need a witness. I could
witness for you, if you'd prefer?

2518
03:04:18,925 --> 03:04:20,532
MARISHA: Really?

2519
03:04:20,532 --> 03:04:23,162
MATT: Just to make sure that there's no funny
business, of course.

2520
03:04:23,162 --> 03:04:28,089
MARISHA: Of course. I have no problems with that.

2521
03:04:28,089 --> 03:04:28,798
LAURA: No.

2522
03:04:28,798 --> 03:04:29,629
MARISHA No problems with that?

2523
03:04:29,629 --> 03:04:30,512
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea.

2524
03:04:30,512 --> 03:04:31,804
LAURA: Solid.

2525
03:04:31,804 --> 03:04:38,948
MATT: Um, find a place of your choosing. I will
come as well.

2526
03:04:38,948 --> 03:04:45,815
MARISHA: Thank you. Do you have any suggestions?
Kind of new to this.

2527
03:04:45,815 --> 03:04:50,623
LAURA: Anything with orange flowers around? I feel
like Senokir would like orange flowers.

2528
03:04:50,623 --> 03:04:59,135
MATT: Not much in the way of blooming flowers of
color in the Birth Heart.

2529
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:04,764
ASHLEY: Is it better to open a box and put the
ashes out or is it--

2530
03:05:04,764 --> 03:05:07,584
MATT: That depends on the interred.

2531
03:05:07,584 --> 03:05:16,817
I mean, whatever the wishes are of the 
one you've lost, but that's--

2532
03:05:16,817 --> 03:05:21,002
TRAVIS: Should we ask if maybe she knows
her, the name?

2533
03:05:21,002 --> 03:05:27,744
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Did you happen to know a woman
named Zaa... Zaafin--

2534
03:05:27,744 --> 03:05:29,374
(laughter)

2535
03:05:29,374 --> 03:05:34,511
LAURA: I literally was thinking "so fine" in my
head and I was trying to remember.

2536
03:05:34,511 --> 03:05:38,370
MATT: I'm afraid I don't know that name, I'm
sorry.

2537
03:05:38,370 --> 03:05:40,952
LAURA: She was a big fan of this place.

2538
03:05:40,952 --> 03:05:42,936
MARISHA: One of her favorite locations.

2539
03:05:42,936 --> 03:05:44,706
MATT: That's very sweet.

2540
03:05:44,706 --> 03:05:47,059
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, well, I think we would just

2541
03:05:47,059 --> 03:05:54,941
like to bury the box without disturbing the box,
right guys?

2542
03:05:54,941 --> 03:05:55,908
LAURA: Probably.

2543
03:05:55,908 --> 03:05:57,148
TRAVIS: Yeah, just put the box in there.

2544
03:05:57,148 --> 03:05:57,862
MARISHA: Okay.

2545
03:05:57,862 --> 03:05:58,899
LIAM: Yes.

2546
03:05:58,899 --> 03:05:59,762
LAURA: Probably.

2547
03:05:59,762 --> 03:06:02,410
MATT: (laughs) She's looking a little awkward from
all this conversation.

2548
03:06:02,410 --> 03:06:03,881
LAURA: We've never buried ashes before.

2549
03:06:03,881 --> 03:06:05,288
TALIESIN: We've had a very long week.

2550
03:06:05,288 --> 03:06:06,731
MARISHA: Yes.

2551
03:06:06,731 --> 03:06:09,130
MATT: You do look a bit worse for wear.

2552
03:06:09,130 --> 03:06:10,620
LIAM: A couple of months, actually.

2553
03:06:10,620 --> 03:06:14,655
MATT: Well, decide on a location of your choosing.

2554
03:06:14,655 --> 03:06:18,054
We will have to keep vigil over it for a short
time.

2555
03:06:18,054 --> 03:06:19,236
LAURA: Great, that's wonderful!

2556
03:06:19,236 --> 03:06:20,432
MARISHA: That's great yes.

2557
03:06:20,432 --> 03:06:21,438
TALIESIN: Excellent.

2558
03:06:21,438 --> 03:06:26,308
MATT: If there is anything found that is not
approved within the Birth Heart,

2559
03:06:26,308 --> 03:06:28,717
it will be excised and removed from 
the premises.

2560
03:06:28,717 --> 03:06:29,611
MARISHA: Great!

2561
03:06:29,611 --> 03:06:30,900
MATT: No disrespect meant.

2562
03:06:30,900 --> 03:06:34,230
LAURA: (clicks her tongue) None taken.

2563
03:06:34,230 --> 03:06:43,756
TRAVIS: Question. What sort of thing would
represent an unwelcome burial?

2564
03:06:43,756 --> 03:06:48,126
MATT: Anything that's not the remains of an
individual like you've promised they are?

2565
03:06:48,126 --> 03:06:51,989
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah. Like foreign seeds or
something?

2566
03:06:51,989 --> 03:06:53,251
MATT: Very much so.

2567
03:06:53,251 --> 03:06:55,468
TRAVIS: Agriculture control, very important.

2568
03:06:55,468 --> 03:06:57,711
LAURA: Bad, bad, very bad.

2569
03:06:57,711 --> 03:07:01,067
LIAM: There are flowers here, aren't there?

2570
03:07:01,067 --> 03:07:04,792
MATT: I mean, simple wildflowers, yes.

2571
03:07:04,792 --> 03:07:09,073
LIAM: Lead the way, please. Whatever is closest.

2572
03:07:09,073 --> 03:07:09,824
MATT: All right.

2573
03:07:09,824 --> 03:07:10,539
LIAM: Thank you.

2574
03:07:10,539 --> 03:07:11,744
MATT: "All right. Follow me."

2575
03:07:11,744 --> 03:07:18,271
She turns around, and she looks not 
mistrusting, but definitely a little confused.

2576
03:07:18,271 --> 03:07:24,415
She brings you to the edge of this pathway 
and you can see there is a nice, smooth-packed

2577
03:07:24,415 --> 03:07:30,163
dirt walk that's well kept, and you can see 
occasionally a few of the priests come through

2578
03:07:30,163 --> 03:07:35,170
with these very fine rake-like brooms that 
they pull through like a very fine zen garden, and

2579
03:07:35,170 --> 03:07:39,571
it rakes the earth as they go through and it helps
then pack it as they walk.

2580
03:07:39,571 --> 03:07:42,089
LIAM: As we walked over here, I turned around to
the group and went--

2581
03:07:42,089 --> 03:07:47,078
(all laugh)

2582
03:07:47,078 --> 03:07:53,194
MATT: She brings you to the edge where the dirt
ends, and you can see the underbrush and greenery

2583
03:07:53,194 --> 03:07:58,844
continues. She steps into it and you watch as each
foot comes down, as you would when you walk

2584
03:07:58,844 --> 03:08:08,516
through a densely wooded area, with each crush of
a plant or a brush or a stick or twig as it

2585
03:08:08,516 --> 03:08:19,874
breaks, it mends itself immediately after she
steps past it. She leads you maybe 70 feet off the

2586
03:08:19,874 --> 03:08:28,423
path, past a couple of the central trees that are
dappled throughout this area. In one spot, you can

2587
03:08:28,423 --> 03:08:31,538
see these faint whitish-grey flowers that are

2588
03:08:31,538 --> 03:08:34,119
gathering in clusters around the base of a tree
here.

2589
03:08:34,119 --> 03:08:34,723
LAURA: That's nice.

2590
03:08:34,723 --> 03:08:36,961
LIAM:  This looks perfect.

2591
03:08:36,961 --> 03:08:38,709
MATT: Well, it is yours to do.

2592
03:08:38,709 --> 03:08:41,619
LAURA: Does the Birth Heart have healing
properties?

2593
03:08:41,619 --> 03:08:48,287
MATT: The Birth Heart has many properties. The
guiding and blessings of Melora are strongest here

2594
03:08:48,287 --> 03:08:56,891
than anywhere on Exandria, and here her presence
is felt even beyond the divine gate.

2595
03:08:56,891 --> 03:08:59,426
LIAM: Pike, this feels right.

2596
03:08:59,426 --> 03:09:01,700
LAURA: Right?

2597
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:02,651
ASHLEY: It does?

2598
03:09:02,651 --> 03:09:04,815
LIAM: Yes, it does.

2599
03:09:04,815 --> 03:09:06,838
LAURA: Does it?

2600
03:09:06,838 --> 03:09:19,939
MARISHA: Okay, look, I feel like this is an
exercise in simplicity for us, and trust, right?

2601
03:09:19,939 --> 03:09:20,750
LAURA: Yeah.

2602
03:09:20,750 --> 03:09:21,545
MARISHA: Right?

2603
03:09:21,545 --> 03:09:24,076
TRAVIS: Sorry for all the questions. It's very
lovely here.

2604
03:09:24,076 --> 03:09:24,711
MATT: Thank you.

2605
03:09:24,711 --> 03:09:25,775
MARISHA: It's not you, it's us.

2606
03:09:25,775 --> 03:09:26,880
LAURA: We're so weird.

2607
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:28,317
MARISHA: (sighs) We really are.

2608
03:09:28,317 --> 03:09:31,089
MATT: I wasn't going to say it, but I'm glad you
brought it up.

2609
03:09:31,089 --> 03:09:37,303
LIAM: Pike, would you bring the box over here,
please? Would you pray with me, please?

2610
03:09:37,303 --> 03:09:40,505
ASHLEY: Well, I-- Matt, can I ask you a question?

2611
03:09:40,505 --> 03:09:42,816
(all laugh)

2612
03:09:42,816 --> 03:09:44,648
MATT: Yeah, yes you may, Ashley.

2613
03:09:44,648 --> 03:09:45,934
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

2614
03:09:45,934 --> 03:09:47,143
LAURA: That got serious!

2615
03:09:47,143 --> 03:09:49,299
TRAVIS: Oh, legit!

2616
03:09:49,299 --> 03:09:51,702
ASHLEY: Is it respectful to--

2617
03:09:51,702 --> 03:09:52,942
LIAM: Spike the box!

2618
03:09:52,942 --> 03:09:57,437
ASHLEY: -- when you're at a place of another god's
worship to--

2619
03:09:57,437 --> 03:10:04,155
I know we did at the resurrection
ritual, but to bring another god into it?

2620
03:10:04,155 --> 03:10:10,499
MATT: Roll a religion check.

2621
03:10:10,499 --> 03:10:14,249
ASHLEY: Oh, fuck it. Do I get advantage?

2622
03:10:14,249 --> 03:10:17,439
MATT: No. You have no idea.

2623
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:18,715
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

2624
03:10:18,715 --> 03:10:22,624
MATT: You've spent some time in Vasselheim, but
it's always been focused around your temple and

2625
03:10:22,624 --> 03:10:26,430
the reconstruction of Sarenrae's temple. You have
spent very little time studying the other

2626
03:10:26,430 --> 03:10:32,960
religions around you and what that sort of
situation would entail, so you have no clue.

2627
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:36,956
MARISHA: Wait, did you say something about a
resurrection? You didn't say that, did you?

2628
03:10:36,956 --> 03:10:38,126
ASHLEY: I was just saying 'cause--

2629
03:10:38,126 --> 03:10:39,668
TRAVIS: The resurrection was both the Raven Queen
and--

2630
03:10:39,668 --> 03:10:42,317
ASHLEY:-- was in the Raven Queen, but we were
using Sarenrae as well.

2631
03:10:42,317 --> 03:10:44,812
MATT: Yeah, so the crossing over of the deities'
influence

2632
03:10:44,812 --> 03:10:46,682
in the space is what she was inquiring
about.

2633
03:10:46,682 --> 03:10:47,782
MARISHA: Right.

2634
03:10:47,782 --> 03:10:49,939
LAURA: Some deities might like each other more
than other deities though.

2635
03:10:49,939 --> 03:10:51,426
TALIESIN: That's very true, actually.

2636
03:10:51,426 --> 03:10:52,786
LIAM: Ours are cool though.

2637
03:10:52,786 --> 03:10:53,588
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

2638
03:10:53,588 --> 03:10:54,285
LIAM: Ours are--

2639
03:10:54,285 --> 03:10:55,112
LAURA: --like besties.

2640
03:10:55,112 --> 03:10:56,065
LIAM: Ours are besties.

2641
03:10:56,065 --> 03:10:57,395
ASHLEY: I feel like Melora and Sarenrae--

2642
03:10:57,395 --> 03:10:59,007
MARISHA: They might be chummy!

2643
03:10:59,007 --> 03:11:00,565
TALIESIN: Or so similar that it might be a
problem?

2644
03:11:00,565 --> 03:11:01,664
LIAM: Yeah.

2645
03:11:01,664 --> 03:11:02,463
MARISHA: Well...

2646
03:11:02,463 --> 03:11:03,531
TRAVIS: This is kind of her spot--

2647
03:11:03,531 --> 03:11:04,912
LIAM: Makes sense on the surface--

2648
03:11:04,912 --> 03:11:07,529
TALIESIN: It's just, there's a lot of clash.

2649
03:11:07,529 --> 03:11:12,033
MARISHA: Well, Melora's more neutral. She's more,
nature is--

2650
03:11:12,033 --> 03:11:13,157
TRAVIS: Earth tone?

2651
03:11:13,157 --> 03:11:17,100
MARISHA: Earth tones, you know. Fall colors.

2652
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:20,863
LIAM: I know that we're all really fucking worn
out,

2653
03:11:20,863 --> 03:11:24,941
but I would like to not cheapen this moment
any more than we maybe already have.

2654
03:11:24,941 --> 03:11:30,038
MARISHA: Guys, when we set out to do this, we
promised we were going to make this easy and

2655
03:11:30,038 --> 03:11:34,200
simple and we can't even do that, we are torturing
ourselves, we are--

2656
03:11:34,200 --> 03:11:35,389
TRAVIS: You're-- you're getting a little--

2657
03:11:35,389 --> 03:11:36,583
MARISHA: -- making this far more complicated--

2658
03:11:36,583 --> 03:11:37,588
LAURA: Whoa, let's stop. Let's stop. Let's just--

2659
03:11:37,588 --> 03:11:38,474
MARISHA: Okay.

2660
03:11:38,474 --> 03:11:40,550
LAURA: -- bury these ashes.

2661
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:41,908
ASHLEY: Percy?

2662
03:11:41,908 --> 03:11:44,191
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my mouth so shut.

2663
03:11:44,191 --> 03:11:53,758
MARISHA: Okay, look. All right. Pike. If you want,
before we do this, I could do a Commune with

2664
03:11:53,758 --> 03:12:00,392
Nature? And maybe study the lands and see if I
could maybe connect with Melora?

2665
03:12:00,392 --> 03:12:03,480
Maybe through my Spire? If you want.

2666
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,815
TRAVIS: Put the box in the ground.

2667
03:12:04,815 --> 03:12:08,201
MARISHA: Okay, or we could just put the box in the
ground, Jesus.

2668
03:12:08,201 --> 03:12:11,008
ASHLEY: All right, well, are we going to dig a
hole or we just--

2669
03:12:11,008 --> 03:12:13,670
LAURA: Is it all right if we dig a hole?

2670
03:12:13,670 --> 03:12:15,577
MATT: I imagine so, yes.

2671
03:12:15,577 --> 03:12:16,409
LAURA: All right.

2672
03:12:16,409 --> 03:12:18,203
MATT: "All right."

2673
03:12:18,203 --> 03:12:19,922
So, you get down to dig a hole?

2674
03:12:19,922 --> 03:12:21,129
LAURA: Sure!

2675
03:12:21,129 --> 03:12:23,112
MATT: It's soft. The ground is pretty malleable,
actually.

2676
03:12:23,112 --> 03:12:25,783
Not like clay, but the dirt isn't
densely packed in this portion.

2677
03:12:25,783 --> 03:12:27,178
LAURA: As I'm doing it, I'm like,

2678
03:12:27,178 --> 03:12:33,494
Melora, you were clutch in the fight against 
Raishan and we appreciate it greatly.

2679
03:12:33,494 --> 03:12:37,571
Thank you for everything
you've done for us. Your trees are beautiful.

2680
03:12:37,571 --> 03:12:40,919
MATT: (laughs)

2681
03:12:40,919 --> 03:12:43,263
ASHLEY: So, we don't know what we're planting
here,

2682
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:45,545
so if it's something bad it's not our
fault--

2683
03:12:45,545 --> 03:12:47,126
(all laugh)

2684
03:12:47,126 --> 03:12:50,320
ASHLEY: Side note.

2685
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:51,836
LAURA: Are you talking to the dirt?

2686
03:12:51,836 --> 03:12:53,606
ASHLEY: I'm talking to Melora through the dirt.

2687
03:12:53,606 --> 03:12:54,687
MARISHA: You just put, like, a

2688
03:12:54,687 --> 03:12:57,802
"we are not responsible for any damages"
clause into the contract.

2689
03:12:57,802 --> 03:13:02,103
LIAM: Um, I am smirking, but trying to pray to the
Raven Queen.

2690
03:13:02,103 --> 03:13:06,208
MATT: Okay. You place the box in?

2691
03:13:06,208 --> 03:13:09,712
ASHLEY: Augh. Yes.

2692
03:13:09,712 --> 03:13:10,510
MATT: Okay.

2693
03:13:10,510 --> 03:13:11,777
LAURA: (laughs)

2694
03:13:11,777 --> 03:13:12,863
MATT: You rest-- you rest the box down--

2695
03:13:12,863 --> 03:13:13,606
ASHLEY: My precious--

2696
03:13:13,606 --> 03:13:16,833
(all laugh)

2697
03:13:16,833 --> 03:13:17,771
ASHLEY: It doesn't feel right!

2698
03:13:17,771 --> 03:13:19,170
TRAVIS: (like Gollum) Why should I?

2699
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:23,857
MATT: -- into the hole freshly dug by Vex.

2700
03:13:23,857 --> 03:13:27,141
LAURA: I'm gonna cover it. It's getting covered.

2701
03:13:27,141 --> 03:13:33,252
MATT: Vex covers it. Takes the dirt, pats it.
(pats down) There, the flowers arranged naturally

2702
03:13:33,252 --> 03:13:40,657
across the tree trunk and the growth surrounding
it. The woman clasps her hands together.

2703
03:13:40,657 --> 03:13:45,311
"Very well. Now, if you please--"

2704
03:13:45,311 --> 03:13:48,079
MARISHA: Would it be okay if I just picked a
couple flowers

2705
03:13:48,079 --> 03:13:53,812
to press and take with me for
remembrance?

2706
03:13:53,812 --> 03:13:58,799
MATT: She reaches over and (click noises).

2707
03:13:58,799 --> 03:14:00,100
"There you are, child."

2708
03:14:00,100 --> 03:14:01,243
MARISHA: Thank you.

2709
03:14:01,243 --> 03:14:04,839
MATT: Now, um. Business is done.

2710
03:14:04,839 --> 03:14:08,841
LAURA: Could we leave a marker of some sort? So we
know exactly where we left her.

2711
03:14:08,841 --> 03:14:10,845
MATT: What would you wish to leave?

2712
03:14:10,845 --> 03:14:17,577
LAURA: I saw earlier circles of stones. Is that
traditional?

2713
03:14:17,577 --> 03:14:20,712
MATT: Depends on your background, of course, if
that's what you prefer.

2714
03:14:20,712 --> 03:14:27,069
We wish nothing with names or engravings. The 
memory is kept by Melora and the presence

2715
03:14:27,069 --> 03:14:30,412
of nature in its own. So, a marker
or--

2716
03:14:30,412 --> 03:14:33,291
LAURA: Can you think of anything Senokir would've
appreciated?

2717
03:14:33,291 --> 03:14:36,616
TALIESIN: I think knowing his work is underground
may be enough.

2718
03:14:36,616 --> 03:14:39,437
MARISHA: I could Stone Shape something simple.

2719
03:14:39,437 --> 03:14:42,448
LAURA: Maybe a ring? He's a jeweler.

2720
03:14:42,448 --> 03:14:43,158
MARISHA: That's true.

2721
03:14:43,158 --> 03:14:44,596
LAURA: It was his wife.

2722
03:14:44,596 --> 03:14:49,610
MARISHA: That's true. I out of the ground Stone
Shape

2723
03:14:49,610 --> 03:14:54,560
what looks like a simplistic fire branded
wedding band.

2724
03:14:54,560 --> 03:15:00,850
MATT: You watch as the earth off to the side of
where you buried the box shakes and a single

2725
03:15:00,850 --> 03:15:06,208
stone, roughly that big, (shaking ground sounds)
finds its way to the surface, like a localized

2726
03:15:06,208 --> 03:15:13,445
earthquake. And as it hits the top, it (cracks)
splits and shapes into a circular band, and then

2727
03:15:13,445 --> 03:15:18,370
falls on the side and rests there for a moment on
top of the dirt pile.

2728
03:15:18,370 --> 03:15:19,206
LAURA: That's perfect.

2729
03:15:19,206 --> 03:15:20,336
LIAM: That's cool.

2730
03:15:20,336 --> 03:15:25,235
MARISHA: Okay. (lets out a deep breath)

2731
03:15:25,235 --> 03:15:30,961
TRAVIS: Thank you for, um, this.

2732
03:15:30,961 --> 03:15:35,761
MATT: I will remain vigil over this.

2733
03:15:35,761 --> 03:15:39,691
You may take your walk up the Birth 
Heart or the rest of Vasselheim.

2734
03:15:39,691 --> 03:15:40,880
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

2735
03:15:40,880 --> 03:15:42,683
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2736
03:15:42,683 --> 03:15:46,907
LAURA: Can we go in? Can we go up and look, or? Is
it like--

2737
03:15:46,907 --> 03:15:53,195
MATT: Well, you would have to speak with the
priests. It's not necessarily an open--

2738
03:15:53,195 --> 03:15:55,437
TRAVIS: It's not the Swiss Family Robinson tree
house.

2739
03:15:55,437 --> 03:15:57,006
LAURA: It's just beautiful, I don't think I've
ever seen--

2740
03:15:57,006 --> 03:16:00,172
MARISHA: Who are the priests?

2741
03:16:00,172 --> 03:16:03,172
MATT: Any of the individuals in similar garb, but

2742
03:16:03,172 --> 03:16:08,350
they have a series of golden rings around their
neck, at the base of the tree.

2743
03:16:08,350 --> 03:16:16,041
MARISHA: I was just curious because, you see, I
have this staff that has Melora's marking on it.

2744
03:16:16,041 --> 03:16:20,443
MATT: She takes a moment, reaches for it. (gasps)

2745
03:16:20,443 --> 03:16:21,497
MARISHA: Wow, that's--

2746
03:16:21,497 --> 03:16:22,738
LAURA: We should've led with that.

2747
03:16:22,738 --> 03:16:27,751
MARISHA: You know, that's quite a reaction. I
wasn't expecting that.

2748
03:16:27,751 --> 03:16:32,343
MATT: This-- where did you-- how? Where did you
come across such an artifact?

2749
03:16:32,343 --> 03:16:37,593
MARISHA: I found it through a series of very hard
and troubling events and circumstances.

2750
03:16:37,593 --> 03:16:39,651
TALIESIN: (laughs)

2751
03:16:39,651 --> 03:16:48,602
MATT: I can only understand that. What you hold in
your hand is one of the great relics of Melora.

2752
03:16:48,602 --> 03:16:52,841
MARISHA: Okay.

2753
03:16:52,841 --> 03:16:57,529
MATT: I must remain as I've chosen my vigil
already,

2754
03:16:57,529 --> 03:17:04,123
but if you would do the honor of the
Birth Heart of having that returned to the

2755
03:17:04,123 --> 03:17:09,903
priestesses of Melora that would be of a great aid
to our people.

2756
03:17:09,903 --> 03:17:11,732
MARISHA: (inhales sharply)

2757
03:17:11,732 --> 03:17:19,141
(all laugh)

2758
03:17:19,141 --> 03:17:20,632
LIAM: He just did that.

2759
03:17:20,632 --> 03:17:22,375
MARISHA: (laughing) Fuck you, Travis.

2760
03:17:22,375 --> 03:17:24,468
TALIESIN: Woooow.

2761
03:17:24,468 --> 03:17:30,014
LAURA: (through her bottle) That's why you keep
things hidden.

2762
03:17:30,014 --> 03:17:31,597
MATT: "It's--"

2763
03:17:31,597 --> 03:17:34,141
And she reaches out and runs her
finger along the side and is like--

2764
03:17:34,141 --> 03:17:39,411
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, you know, that's enough.
That's enough touching.

2765
03:17:39,411 --> 03:17:47,158
MATT: A magic, a force as potent in that. You're
blessed to have found it.

2766
03:17:47,158 --> 03:17:49,895
LAURA: She's aided us greatly.

2767
03:17:49,895 --> 03:17:52,036
MATT: As she does us all.

2768
03:17:52,036 --> 03:18:03,606
MARISHA: What if her aid-- (clears throat) What if
her aid was best used--

2769
03:18:03,606 --> 03:18:05,076
LAURA: Protecting the world--

2770
03:18:05,076 --> 03:18:08,155
MARISHA: -- in the world. And not maybe in a
museum.

2771
03:18:08,155 --> 03:18:11,311
MATT: That is your choice, not mine.

2772
03:18:11,311 --> 03:18:13,733
TALIESIN: I think perhaps there will come a time,

2773
03:18:13,733 --> 03:18:17,510
but that it is not yet time to put the staff to
rest.

2774
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:21,181
MARISHA: Look-- (sighs painfully)

2775
03:18:21,181 --> 03:18:31,323
TRAVIS: Wow. Just walk away. Walk away.

2776
03:18:31,323 --> 03:18:38,957
MARISHA: You know, I don't want to hold on to
anything if it doesn't rightfully belong to me,

2777
03:18:38,957 --> 03:18:44,716
but this has also been lost for a long time. So
who does it rightfully belong to?

2778
03:18:44,716 --> 03:18:47,195
And I'm trying to do good with it.

2779
03:18:47,195 --> 03:18:49,211
MATT: (shushes) She reaches out and touches your
forehead.

2780
03:18:49,211 --> 03:18:52,068
MARISHA: Okay. I just-- I don't wanna--

2781
03:18:52,068 --> 03:18:55,734
MATT: It's all right. We mean not to take it from
you.

2782
03:18:55,734 --> 03:18:56,967
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2783
03:18:56,967 --> 03:19:03,167
MATT: If it still has purpose in your hands, keep
it. Keep it safe. Do not lose it as you say it was

2784
03:19:03,167 --> 03:19:16,918
once lost. And when you find the need for such
power no longer necessary, then return it.

2785
03:19:16,918 --> 03:19:23,277
MARISHA: I promise you I will.

2786
03:19:23,277 --> 03:19:29,967
And I'm very grateful, and I do feel very blessed 
that I found it and that I have this power.

2787
03:19:29,967 --> 03:19:36,732
MATT: Then use it to spread her love. Use it to
spread her comfort and protection.

2788
03:19:36,732 --> 03:19:42,117
LAURA: Champion of Melora! I see it now.

2789
03:19:42,117 --> 03:19:47,784
MARISHA: You know-- (sighs)

2790
03:19:47,784 --> 03:19:49,126
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2791
03:19:49,126 --> 03:19:57,873
MARISHA: Is there a way? 'Cause you see, I'm not
great with the gods, but I've never really spoken

2792
03:19:57,873 --> 03:20:05,725
to Melora. I have a lot of friends who are very
much supporters of her.

2793
03:20:05,725 --> 03:20:11,217
Is there something I could
do to show my thanks?

2794
03:20:11,217 --> 03:20:14,534
MATT: I think that the fact that you still hold
that to this day means that her favor smiles on

2795
03:20:14,534 --> 03:20:23,862
you. If you walk the path she rides, maybe you'll
find a way to talk with her yourself. But there is

2796
03:20:23,862 --> 03:20:35,615
no key, there is no trick, there is no secret. She
speaks through the growing buds of the flowers

2797
03:20:35,615 --> 03:20:42,188
below, she speaks through the rain that comes and
brings water to them to grow. I'm sure she's

2798
03:20:42,188 --> 03:20:54,518
spoken to you most of your life. Maybe now your
ears are open to listen.

2799
03:20:54,518 --> 03:20:57,924
MARISHA: Thank you, Lamor.

2800
03:20:57,924 --> 03:20:59,061
MATT: You're welcome.

2801
03:20:59,061 --> 03:21:01,063
MARISHA: I will not forget your words.

2802
03:21:01,063 --> 03:21:08,378
MATT: I hope not. There is great wisdom in that
staff, as there is great wisdom in you.

2803
03:21:08,378 --> 03:21:12,068
MARISHA: (exhales) Okay.

2804
03:21:12,068 --> 03:21:15,914
MATT: You doubt yourself too much, child.

2805
03:21:15,914 --> 03:21:20,588
MARISHA: People keep telling me that. Okay. All
right. Thank you. Thank you.

2806
03:21:20,588 --> 03:21:26,124
MATT: She takes your hand and cups it into both of
hers and holds it for a second.

2807
03:21:26,124 --> 03:21:29,527
MARISHA: (whispers) I'm so conflicted. Thank you.
Okay, bye.

2808
03:21:29,527 --> 03:21:31,476
MATT: Aren't we all.

2809
03:21:31,476 --> 03:21:33,071
TRAVIS: Do we get to leave the arboretum now?

2810
03:21:33,071 --> 03:21:36,093
(everyone laughs)

2811
03:21:36,093 --> 03:21:38,176
LAURA: It was beautiful, though, while it lasted.

2812
03:21:38,176 --> 03:21:39,409
ASHLEY: It's so beautiful.

2813
03:21:39,409 --> 03:21:41,322
TRAVIS: I stepped on this toadstool and I'm afraid
to tell someone.

2814
03:21:41,322 --> 03:21:42,952
(everyone laughs)

2815
03:21:42,952 --> 03:21:44,331
LAURA: I think it'll grow back, Grog.

2816
03:21:44,331 --> 03:21:45,671
ASHLEY: Yeah, take your foot off and watch.

2817
03:21:45,671 --> 03:21:48,141
TRAVIS: I can't. I'm scared, they're looking
really close.

2818
03:21:48,141 --> 03:21:50,433
LIAM: Let's get her out of here before they change
their mind, alright? Yeah.

2819
03:21:50,433 --> 03:21:51,134
LAURA: Yeah.

2820
03:21:51,134 --> 03:21:52,675
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

2821
03:21:52,675 --> 03:21:55,633
TALIESIN: I could watch your moral panic all day,
it's so delightful.

2822
03:21:55,633 --> 03:21:59,250
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy!

2823
03:21:59,250 --> 03:22:02,076
MATT: As you guys make your way out of the Birth
Heart,

2824
03:22:02,076 --> 03:22:06,604
into the Abundant Terrace, what do you wish
to do?

2825
03:22:06,604 --> 03:22:12,845
TRAVIS: See, that was not such a big deal. All
that fuss for a box in the dirt.

2826
03:22:12,845 --> 03:22:16,511
LAURA: Do we need to stock up on supplies?

2827
03:22:16,511 --> 03:22:21,330
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. We haven't been to a right
proper store in a long time, right?

2828
03:22:21,330 --> 03:22:27,521
LAURA: Yeah. Do you need to check in on the
temple?

2829
03:22:27,521 --> 03:22:31,181
ASHLEY: Maybe, I don't know.

2830
03:22:31,181 --> 03:22:32,530
TRAVIS: What's wrong with you?

2831
03:22:32,530 --> 03:22:36,049
ASHLEY: I dunno, I just still feel weird about it.

2832
03:22:36,049 --> 03:22:40,231
LIAM: You know, this might be a bit of a wild
hare, but watching you back there,

2833
03:22:40,231 --> 03:22:41,990
I had a thought. Grog.

2834
03:22:41,990 --> 03:22:43,371
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2835
03:22:43,371 --> 03:22:47,586
LIAM: I mean, we've just had a really hard time
for weeks, months.

2836
03:22:47,586 --> 03:22:55,954
It was fuckin' awful. You seem
a bit punchy. You wanna take her--

2837
03:22:55,954 --> 03:22:59,646
TRAVIS: (gasps) Say it.

2838
03:22:59,646 --> 03:23:01,095
LIAM: -- to the Crucible?

2839
03:23:01,095 --> 03:23:02,255
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2840
03:23:02,255 --> 03:23:04,525
LIAM: To let off a little bit of steam?

2841
03:23:04,525 --> 03:23:06,268
ASHLEY: What's the Crucible?

2842
03:23:06,268 --> 03:23:07,926
LAURA: (gasps)

2843
03:23:07,926 --> 03:23:12,383
TRAVIS: Are you sure you weren't here? Were you
not?

2844
03:23:12,383 --> 03:23:13,939
LIAM: Think she was off.

2845
03:23:13,939 --> 03:23:15,791
MARISHA: I think she had just left.

2846
03:23:15,791 --> 03:23:24,248
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. The Crucible is a pit
fighting arena next to the temple of Kord, right?

2847
03:23:24,248 --> 03:23:25,182
Around that area?

2848
03:23:25,182 --> 03:23:26,308
MATT: In the Trial Forge, yeah.

2849
03:23:26,308 --> 03:23:28,666
TRAVIS: In the Trial Forge. Yeah. One on one.

2850
03:23:28,666 --> 03:23:31,031
LIAM: We know you are an angel, but we know that

2851
03:23:31,031 --> 03:23:33,653
you also have a little bit of piss and vinegar in
you.

2852
03:23:33,653 --> 03:23:34,730
TRAVIS: No weapons.

2853
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:35,902
ASHLEY: Yeah-- No weapons?

2854
03:23:35,902 --> 03:23:36,507
TRAVIS: Nope.

2855
03:23:36,507 --> 03:23:37,303
LAURA: Just a fist fight.

2856
03:23:37,303 --> 03:23:38,236
ASHLEY: No armor? Nothing?

2857
03:23:38,236 --> 03:23:40,083
TRAVIS: No, you can have--

2858
03:23:40,083 --> 03:23:41,404
LAURA: Yeah, armor?

2859
03:23:41,404 --> 03:23:45,708
TRAVIS: It's like a bare-knuckle fight.

2860
03:23:45,708 --> 03:23:49,000
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty much fisticuffs in the
Crucible.

2861
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:50,343
LIAM: They got gnome fights there?

2862
03:23:50,343 --> 03:23:51,360
LAURA: They got gnome fights?

2863
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:52,928
ASHLEY: They got gnome fights?

2864
03:23:52,928 --> 03:23:54,140
MATT: (laughs)

2865
03:23:54,140 --> 03:23:55,450
ASHLEY: That sounds like a blast.

2866
03:23:55,450 --> 03:23:58,580
TALIESIN: I wanna see if I can find two small
stones while we're walking through the path.

2867
03:23:58,580 --> 03:24:03,747
I wanna find two pretty reasonable fire-starting
stones.

2868
03:24:03,747 --> 03:24:04,943
MATT: Flints, you mean?

2869
03:24:04,943 --> 03:24:06,323
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a flint.

2870
03:24:06,323 --> 03:24:11,749
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check-- well, this
would be investigation, 'cause you're--

2871
03:24:11,749 --> 03:24:14,081
TALIESIN: Man. Nine

2872
03:24:14,081 --> 03:24:16,176
MATT: You find one.

2873
03:24:16,176 --> 03:24:22,307
TALIESIN: Damn it. I'm gonna keep looking.

2874
03:24:22,307 --> 03:24:24,006
LAURA: What're you doing with a rock?

2875
03:24:24,006 --> 03:24:25,020
TALIESIN: (sighs)

2876
03:24:25,020 --> 03:24:26,878
LAURA: Doesn't seem like something you normally
look for.

2877
03:24:26,878 --> 03:24:27,824
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

2878
03:24:27,824 --> 03:24:29,109
LAURA: It's more Grog's speed there.

2879
03:24:29,109 --> 03:24:30,762
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was just thinking that he needs
a gift.

2880
03:24:30,762 --> 03:24:32,822
TRAVIS: I mean does anybody-- You got a gift for
me?

2881
03:24:32,822 --> 03:24:33,701
TALIESIN: Not yet.

2882
03:24:33,701 --> 03:24:39,201
TRAVIS: Oh. I mean, I dunno about anybody else,
but besides the store, I would like to go by the

2883
03:24:39,201 --> 03:24:44,463
temple of Kord again. Just pop in. I don't want to
bore anybody.

2884
03:24:44,463 --> 03:24:45,920
MARISHA: No.

2885
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:46,876
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

2886
03:24:46,876 --> 03:24:47,646
LAURA: We can go there.

2887
03:24:47,646 --> 03:24:48,595
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

2888
03:24:48,595 --> 03:24:52,028
MARISHA: I'm sure we bored you several times with
our god mumbo-jumbo.

2889
03:24:52,028 --> 03:24:54,569
TRAVIS: No, yeah, you have. Been keeping track.

2890
03:24:54,569 --> 03:24:56,098
(everyone laughs)

2891
03:24:56,098 --> 03:24:58,946
MARISHA: Tell me how you really feel, Grog. Yeah.

2892
03:24:58,946 --> 03:25:01,164
TRAVIS: I resent you.

2893
03:25:01,164 --> 03:25:05,053
MARISHA: You know what? Never mind. I take all of
it back.

2894
03:25:05,053 --> 03:25:09,851
TRAVIS: Well, I thought you-- all right.

2895
03:25:09,851 --> 03:25:16,569
LIAM: Tangentially, not today, not for a while. I
need to go back to--

2896
03:25:16,569 --> 03:25:17,804
MARISHA: The temple of the Raven Queen?

2897
03:25:17,804 --> 03:25:19,738
LIAM: Yeah, not today. Eventually.

2898
03:25:19,738 --> 03:25:21,047
MARISHA: Do you even want to today?

2899
03:25:21,047 --> 03:25:22,732
LIAM: No, I don't want to today.

2900
03:25:22,732 --> 03:25:30,053
MARISHA: You know, you never came back last night.
Thought you were gonna come back.

2901
03:25:30,208 --> 03:25:38,314
LIAM: (softly) I'll come back.

2902
03:25:38,314 --> 03:25:39,854
MARISHA: Carry on!

2903
03:25:39,854 --> 03:25:41,269
(laughter)

2904
03:25:41,269 --> 03:25:44,991
MATT: So as you guys are walking, where are you
headed? Are you headed to the Birth--

2905
03:25:44,991 --> 03:25:46,596
TRAVIS: The Birth?

2906
03:25:46,596 --> 03:25:47,758
MATT: Uh, what's it called? Sorry.

2907
03:25:47,758 --> 03:25:48,728
TRAVIS: The Trial Forge?

2908
03:25:48,728 --> 03:25:49,787
MATT: Oh, the Trial Forge is--

2909
03:25:49,787 --> 03:25:50,862
TRAVIS: The temple of Kord?

2910
03:25:50,862 --> 03:25:51,598
MATT: -- is the temple. Yeah.

2911
03:25:51,598 --> 03:25:53,744
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I would like to go to the
temple of Kord. Pike, do you want to see--

2912
03:25:53,744 --> 03:25:54,824
MATT: The Braving Grounds.

2913
03:25:54,824 --> 03:25:56,116
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Braving Grounds.

2914
03:25:56,116 --> 03:25:57,252
LAURA: The Braving Grounds.

2915
03:25:57,252 --> 03:25:58,244
LIAM: Oh, man.

2916
03:25:58,244 --> 03:25:59,510
LAURA: By the Obleiz.

2917
03:25:59,510 --> 03:26:00,652
LIAM: The Oubliette?

2918
03:26:00,652 --> 03:26:01,675
LAURA: Obliette.

2919
03:26:01,675 --> 03:26:02,760
ASHLEY: Oubliette.

2920
03:26:02,760 --> 03:26:03,926
MATT: (laughs)

2921
03:26:03,926 --> 03:26:05,119
MARISHA: (aside to Taliesin) What do you want for
me to cantrip?

2922
03:26:05,119 --> 03:26:06,617
TALIESIN: (aside to Marisha) Well, I just want,
like, another one. Two.

2923
03:26:06,617 --> 03:26:08,334
LIAM: Does that exist somewhere in this city, the
Oubliette?

2924
03:26:08,334 --> 03:26:09,318
LAURA: It does!

2925
03:26:09,318 --> 03:26:10,473
MARISHA: Two plinths? Yeah, I think I can
Druidcraft that.

2926
03:26:10,473 --> 03:26:12,190
LIAM: It it likely that we have--

2927
03:26:12,190 --> 03:26:20,242
MATT: It is in-- let me check my notes real fast.
It's in the Duskmeadows.

2928
03:26:20,242 --> 03:26:21,780
The Amaranthine Oubliette.

2929
03:26:21,780 --> 03:26:23,172
LAURA: Oh, that's what it was.

2930
03:26:23,172 --> 03:26:24,946
LIAM: Right. Oh, out of character, Ashley, I wish
you were here next week.

2931
03:26:24,946 --> 03:26:26,065
ASHLEY: (groans)

2932
03:26:26,065 --> 03:26:27,271
LIAM: We're gonna get into a fuckin' fist fight!

2933
03:26:27,271 --> 03:26:28,198
LAURA: Oh, man!

2934
03:26:28,198 --> 03:26:29,587
LIAM: Down in the Crucible!

2935
03:26:29,587 --> 03:26:30,617
TRAVIS: She's looking at her schedule.

2936
03:26:30,617 --> 03:26:32,000
LAURA: Are you looking at your schedule?

2937
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:36,654
TRAVIS: Can we make our way towards the Temple of
Kord?

2938
03:26:36,654 --> 03:26:39,899
MATT: Yes, so you guys make your way to the Birth
Heart. It's easy to follow. Out of all the areas

2939
03:26:39,899 --> 03:26:43,676
in here that are more clean-- the Birth Heart,
sorry, the Braving Grounds.

2940
03:26:43,676 --> 03:26:44,487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2941
03:26:44,487 --> 03:26:49,709
MATT: The Braving Grounds is where all the
ironwork, metalwork, smithy, and refining of

2942
03:26:49,709 --> 03:26:57,677
various burnable fuels are maintained. So you see
the plumes of coal smoke coming out of the various

2943
03:26:57,677 --> 03:27:06,785
forges. You head that direction, following that as
a very definitive visual reference point. It takes

2944
03:27:06,785 --> 03:27:13,859
you the better part of an hour or so, making your
way through the crowds, the Bastions, and it seems

2945
03:27:13,859 --> 03:27:16,985
like not a whole lot has changed since last time
you were in Vasselheim. For all the chaos and

2946
03:27:16,985 --> 03:27:22,960
destruction you have seen in Tal'Dorei, it appears
that Isilra is none the wiser, and life goes on.

2947
03:27:22,960 --> 03:27:25,347
LAURA: Wow.

2948
03:27:25,347 --> 03:27:28,111
MATT: You make your way through the Braving
Grounds to the Trial Forge. And there you see

2949
03:27:28,111 --> 03:27:34,898
before you the large Temple of Kord, the dark deep
red rusted iron color of the temple, with the

2950
03:27:34,898 --> 03:27:45,248
statue on top. The front doors, the tall, thin
doors are open just enough for about two

2951
03:27:45,248 --> 03:27:51,074
shoulders-width of people to walk through. The
interior appears to be brightly lit.

2952
03:27:51,074 --> 03:27:54,951
TRAVIS: Do you want to go inside? Only the strong
may enter.

2953
03:27:54,951 --> 03:27:56,402
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go with you.

2954
03:27:56,402 --> 03:27:58,895
TRAVIS: All right. I would like to go inside.

2955
03:27:58,895 --> 03:27:59,577
MATT: All right.

2956
03:27:59,577 --> 03:28:03,500
LAURA: Should we wait out here for you?

2957
03:28:03,500 --> 03:28:06,418
TRAVIS: Meh. You can come in if you want.

2958
03:28:06,418 --> 03:28:07,886
LAURA: All right.

2959
03:28:07,886 --> 03:28:09,888
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2960
03:28:09,888 --> 03:28:15,986
MATT: Okay. You guys walk into the temple. There
are no sentries.

2961
03:28:16,042 --> 03:28:20,053
There are no worshipers of Kord that you remember

2962
03:28:20,053 --> 03:28:22,909
greeting you the first time you came to the temple.

2963
03:28:22,909 --> 03:28:27,168
The hallway's just this
straight shot to the central cross section.

2964
03:28:27,168 --> 03:28:33,306
TRAVIS: That's strange. There's usually people
here. (clears throat) Hello?

2965
03:28:33,306 --> 03:28:41,198
MATT: You keep walking, making your way down the
smooth, dark, granite-like floors. You can see the

2966
03:28:41,198 --> 03:28:48,411
tall archway just continues and the repeated
pattern of the pillars that mark the strength

2967
03:28:48,411 --> 03:28:53,811
portions of the archway, meeting in the center,
just over and over again, like this oversized

2968
03:28:53,811 --> 03:28:59,318
spinal column, almost, in the way that it's
segmented, eventually coming to where the center

2969
03:28:59,318 --> 03:29:05,815
points cross, where the sand pit, you recall, the
center of the Trial Forge was. As you approach,

2970
03:29:05,815 --> 03:29:10,126
you see a singular figure standing in the center
of the pit, facing away from you.

2971
03:29:10,126 --> 03:29:12,348
TRAVIS: (blows out a slow breath)

2972
03:29:12,348 --> 03:29:23,621
MATT: You see the same dark, deep ruddy color and
weather-texture of the shoulder muscles and arms

2973
03:29:23,621 --> 03:29:32,636
resting at the side. The same grayish-white hair
pulling down the back of the bald-on-top head. The

2974
03:29:32,636 --> 03:29:41,127
reds and golds of the billowing pants there before
you. And as you approach quietly towards the edge

2975
03:29:41,127 --> 03:29:47,208
of the sand pit, the voice shouts out,

2976
03:29:47,208 --> 03:29:57,360
"I have had visions in my rest of your path to 
war, Strongjaw. You took my words and you

2977
03:29:57,360 --> 03:30:07,916
found your strength.
What have you learned?"

2978
03:30:07,916 --> 03:30:16,881
TRAVIS: That without my friends, and love, my
strength would be nothing.

2979
03:30:16,881 --> 03:30:18,702
MATT: Then show me what you have learned.

2980
03:30:18,702 --> 03:30:20,228
LAURA: Oh, shit.

2981
03:30:20,228 --> 03:30:28,068
MATT: "Show me what you possess. Show me your
worth under the watch of Kord, half-giant.

2982
03:30:28,068 --> 03:30:29,237
"Show me."

2983
03:30:29,237 --> 03:30:32,282
And he turns around. (smashing sound) And
he--

2984
03:30:32,282 --> 03:30:33,068
LAURA: Fight!

2985
03:30:33,068 --> 03:30:35,534
MATT: -- slams his fists into the side and the
sand that's around him (exploding sound), dusts

2986
03:30:35,534 --> 03:30:42,016
out in this small arc and then rests in the ground
and he looks up.

2987
03:30:42,016 --> 03:30:43,779
TRAVIS: I'm having a DBZ orgasm right now.

2988
03:30:43,779 --> 03:30:45,252
LAURA: (sings the Dragon Ball Z theme song)

2989
03:30:45,252 --> 03:30:46,332
MATT: And that's where we're gonna finish the
episode.

2990
03:30:46,332 --> 03:30:48,094
(everyone yells)

2991
03:30:48,094 --> 03:30:49,642
MATT: (laughs)

2992
03:30:49,642 --> 03:30:50,762
MARISHA: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

2993
03:30:50,762 --> 03:30:52,061
TALIESIN: --what you've GOOOOT!

2994
03:30:52,061 --> 03:30:53,297
TALIESIN: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

2995
03:30:53,297 --> 03:30:54,744
MARISHA: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

2996
03:30:54,744 --> 03:30:56,245
TALIESIN: Show me what you've got!

2997
03:30:56,245 --> 03:30:57,999
(everyone laughs)

2998
03:30:57,999 --> 03:31:02,174
LAURA: How long have you waited-- how long have
you--

2999
03:31:02,174 --> 03:31:03,108
TRAVIS: Since last time.

3000
03:31:03,108 --> 03:31:04,307
LAURA: Oh, shit!

3001
03:31:04,307 --> 03:31:05,375
MARISHA: Yes!

3002
03:31:05,375 --> 03:31:06,348
LAURA: Oh, man.

3003
03:31:06,348 --> 03:31:07,549
MATT: Since, like, whenever you got back to the
Trial Forge--

3004
03:31:07,549 --> 03:31:08,611
TRAVIS: (cries out)

3005
03:31:08,611 --> 03:31:09,665
MATT: -- that's been sitting there.

3006
03:31:09,665 --> 03:31:10,956
MARISHA: Yeah!

3007
03:31:10,956 --> 03:31:11,829
MATT: You never went back.

3008
03:31:11,829 --> 03:31:13,149
TALIESIN: What? What?

3009
03:31:13,149 --> 03:31:14,462
MATT: We'll pick up on, pick up on that next week.

3010
03:31:14,462 --> 03:31:15,601
LIAM: Round two. Fight!

3011
03:31:15,601 --> 03:31:16,694
MARISHA: Fight!

3012
03:31:16,694 --> 03:31:19,782
(Taliesin and Marisha sing the Mortal Kombat
Theme)

3013
03:31:19,782 --> 03:31:21,507
TRAVIS: He's a bad dude.

3014
03:31:21,507 --> 03:31:23,371
LAURA: Yeah, but in the best way.

3015
03:31:23,371 --> 03:31:26,882
TRAVIS: It was Scanlan, Vax, and me against him--

3016
03:31:26,882 --> 03:31:28,076
LIAM: Don't pick me again.

3017
03:31:28,076 --> 03:31:30,729
TRAVIS: -- and we were giving him everything we
had with Craven Edge,

3018
03:31:30,729 --> 03:31:32,130
and he was just shrugging it
off, like--

3019
03:31:32,130 --> 03:31:33,295
ASHLEY: Nothing.

3020
03:31:33,295 --> 03:31:35,439
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were slashing through at his
forearms and then he would,

3021
03:31:35,439 --> 03:31:38,445
like, go (grunting
sound) and all the wounds would heal.

3022
03:31:38,445 --> 03:31:39,618
ASHLEY: (laughs)

3023
03:31:39,618 --> 03:31:42,473
TRAVIS: Who did he one-hit punch? The one punch?

3024
03:31:42,473 --> 03:31:44,149
LIAM: Me.

3025
03:31:44,149 --> 03:31:46,366
TRAVIS: Yeah, and he could have killed Vax.

3026
03:31:46,366 --> 03:31:47,179
ASHLEY: One punch!

3027
03:31:47,179 --> 03:31:48,942
TRAVIS: With one punch. But he held it.

3028
03:31:48,942 --> 03:31:49,769
MARISHA: With quivering--

3029
03:31:49,769 --> 03:31:50,692
TALIESIN: Quivering Palm.

3030
03:31:50,692 --> 03:31:51,822
MATT: He held back specifically. He was just
teaching Grog a lesson.

3031
03:31:51,822 --> 03:31:53,118
LAURA: It's serious.

3032
03:31:53,118 --> 03:31:54,886
TRAVIS: He just held him one hit, like boom! And
Vex went waaaaah!

3033
03:31:54,886 --> 03:31:55,742
LAURA: Vax.

3034
03:31:55,742 --> 03:31:56,430
TRAVIS: Sorry.

3035
03:31:56,430 --> 03:31:57,355
LIAM: Vix.

3036
03:31:57,355 --> 03:31:58,891
TALIESIN: The potion of broken heart.

3037
03:31:58,891 --> 03:31:59,880
TRAVIS: He's a bad, bad dude.

3038
03:31:59,880 --> 03:32:00,857
ASHLEY: Oh, my god.

3039
03:32:00,857 --> 03:32:02,137
LAURA: But in a good way. He's, like, super, super
smart.

3040
03:32:02,137 --> 03:32:03,329
MARISHA: He's awesome.

3041
03:32:03,329 --> 03:32:04,242
ASHLEY: You're gonna have your--

3042
03:32:04,242 --> 03:32:08,125
TRAVIS: Well, the last time he was like, "Where
does your strength come from?"
