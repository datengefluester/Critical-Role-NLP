1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,224
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:06,394
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:13,868
LIAM: It's been a while! So long since Matthew
Mercer ran Dungeons & Dragons!

4
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:15,866
MATT: It's been a nice break.

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,992
TRAVIS: That chair has been violated by more than
a few people.

6
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:19,506
MATT: I can smell it.

7
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,882
TRAVIS: They told me to wear pants.

8
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:28,177
MATT: The very onion musk you got from that end of
the table. I miss it; I do! I'm excited for the

9
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:32,641
new campaign and the new year. I've been working
really hard on that world. I hope you guys are

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,540
excited, too. We'll have information about that
first game soon. But tonight, we're excited

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,205
because we get to have the fantastic Jennifer Hale
join us!

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:46,810
JENNIFER: I am honored and terrified. I am a
virgin.

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,484
TRAVIS: A quote, right above your head, "Honored
and terrified."

14
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:51,308
JENNIFER: Call me HT.

15
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:57,157
MATT: There you go. Hashtag. We're happy to have
you. Excited for you to play. Once again, don't

16
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,396
feel stressed. Ask questions if you need them.
People are here to help you. You'll be good.

17
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:03,074
LAURA: Be stressed. Very, very stressed.

18
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:10,031
MATT: Laura, we talked about this. Tonight, on top
of that, we have a very special one-shot. The

19
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:15,762
fantastic folks at Blizzard have come together and
asked us to do a Hearthstone one-shot in

20
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:22,034
celebration of the upcoming expansion, Kobolds &
Catacombs. Super excited about that. For those who

21
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:26,486
aren't aware of it, it's an upcoming expansion for
the card game, Hearthstone, that brings the

22
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:31,219
classic fantasy dungeon crawl element to the
awesome, existing card game. It incorporates a

23
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,298
bunch of cool, mysterious magical items, nine new
legendary weapons, some of which you'll recognize

24
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:40,805
if you've played World of Warcraft in the recent
expansions. There's unidentified magical items

25
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:45,129
that you can find in the game, so this has
definitely more of a D&D, classic-dungeon-crawl

26
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:49,291
feel. There's spell stones you have to power as
you go through. It's got a lot of really cool new

27
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,489
mechanics that add to the game. They have a
single-player dungeon run mode now, where you're

28
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,123
actually doing a dungeon delve with your Hearthstone
deck, playing through a storyline, making choices.

29
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:03,622
It brings a whole new kind of tabletop element to
the game. I've seen a bunch of it. They even had

30
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,836
me come and sing in the trailer, so I've been tied
to this--

31
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,819
LAURA: It was so fabulous, Matt!

32
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,673
MATT: Possibly other elements of the expansion.
But it's been really fun and we're excited for you

33
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:18,644
guys to check it out. For those who've been
playing the game, there's a new mechanic called

34
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:22,280
recruit, which allows you to recruit members to
your party, basically minions from your deck, to

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,450
help you out. So there's a whole bunch of new
mechanics that work out for the new dungeon-run

36
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,384
mode and other elements of the game, so definitely
look forward to checking that out. It is coming

37
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:41,842
out December 7th, so right around the corner. Keep
an eye out for that. Go to bit.ly/crhearth to stay

38
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:47,878
up to date and learn more. Also, to celebrate the
release of Hearthstone, the people at Blizzard

39
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:54,401
have created a custom kobold escape room, based on
one of the lairs in the world. They'll be

40
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:59,110
live-streaming players and personalities from the
Hearthstone community going through that escape

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,613
room on December 5th, at 4:30pm Pacific time, at
twitch.tv/playhearthstone, or

42
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:12,215
youtube.com/hearthstone. Check it out to get to
vote on items to try and make their way through

43
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:16,143
it. It's actually a community-interactive event.
Looks to be pretty cool, so definitely go check

44
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,408
that out on December 5th. And then the expansion
on December 7th!

45
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,664
TALIESIN: This is why I feel bad in not reading
the announcements, now. That sounds like fun!

46
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:30,379
LAURA: It's all a surprise for us. Oh, I have an
announcement! Wait, but I don't think I have it

47
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,541
with me!

48
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,339
TALIESIN: Wait, is it this?

49
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,807
LAURA: It is that! Okay. I'm ready.

50
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,286
MATT: All right, go for it.

51
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:46,611
LAURA: Okay, it's my turn? Da da-da da! We have
new merch in the store now! We've been waiting on

52
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:54,320
these ones for so long, and they're finally here!
It's so beautiful. This is the artwork that's on

53
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,773
my save screen on my phone. It's been that way for
a long-- me and Ashley both. We're in love with

54
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:06,381
this art. It's got pages so you can take all your
personal D&D notes in here. That's why we did it.

55
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:12,730
And it goes with our pencil set, so you can have,
you know. You can have one, Jen, if you want!

56
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,694
TALIESIN: You can make your own art book.

57
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:19,289
LAURA: So yeah, go check it out! It's in the store
now!

58
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:28,007
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura. Also, cool note.
The third issue of Critical Role - Vox Machina:

59
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:35,331
Origins comic is available. It's getting more and
more intense as each issue goes along. Check it

60
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:40,597
out if you haven't had a chance. It's on
Comixology, digital.darkhorse.com, and wherever

61
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:46,268
else you can find digital comics online. It's
pretty radical. Me and Liam, who have read the

62
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:51,033
scripts and given notes on the scripts for future
issues, this is getting better and better as it

63
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,620
goes.

64
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,271
TRAVIS: Kings of the kingdom! We don't even know,
but you do!

65
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:01,174
LIAM: Three just came out. I just read five, and
it is so baller. Oh my god.

66
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:09,080
MATT: Be patient with the rest of them, Taliesin.

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:21,391
LIAM: Also, to rewind, that beautiful art on that
book is by @NatRoze. Roze with a Z. Made that ages

68
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,744
ago, and Laura's been in love with it for ages.

69
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:28,223
LAURA: Yes, and so we had to put it on a notebook.
And doesn't it look so perfect? It's so perfect.

70
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,589
And by the way, it's the Feywild!

71
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:37,585
TALIESIN: I'm very excited. I was not aware this
was coming down the pipe.

72
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:40,388
LAURA: Yeah, and it's shiny. I don't know if you
can see it, but there's a little shimmer.

73
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:45,982
TALIESIN: Thanks to the art book, I know what this
is called. It's called spot gloss. Thanks to the

74
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:48,420
art book, I know it's got a spot gloss cover.

75
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,771
LIAM: That is one shiny bear ass.

76
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:54,568
TALIESIN: You can rub it for luck.

77
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:57,186
LAURA: If you're so inclined.

78
00:05:57,186 --> 00:06:02,439
MATT: So you are all here tonight to witness
somebody in a very, completely honest way, shout

79
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:11,846
excitedly, "And it's in the Feywild!" And I love
that that is a thing that happened. Couple other

80
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:18,551
quick announcements so we can get into the game. I
will be at Paradise City Comic Con in Miami,

81
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:23,399
January 12th to 14th. All of you folks out there,
east coast Florida. I'm visiting my old stomping

82
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:30,277
grounds where I originally grew up. Check me out
there. Also, later in 2018, I'll be at Otafest in

83
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:35,283
Calgary, May 18th to 20th, and A-Kon in Texas,
June 7th through the 10th. Early announcement for

84
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:38,958
those dates, but that way if you want to come and
say hi, you can mark it in your calendar.

85
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:46,230
TRAVIS: We're at SacAnime, January 5th or 6th or
something. It's the first week of January. We

86
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,744
hated missing when Sam and Liam went.

87
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:51,147
LAURA: We love SacAnime. It's great.

88
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:56,883
JENNIFER: I got to hang with you guys at SacAnime
a few years ago. We did an interview. It was so

89
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,344
fun!

90
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:04,319
LIAM: We tried to get you to talk about killing
your friends and you would not do it. Why won't

91
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,177
you kill your friends? What's the matter with
you?

92
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,420
JENNIFER: Tonight I will.

93
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,418
MATT: No, you're supposed to collaborate, but
we'll see how it goes. Did a new episode of

94
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,098
Madness go up?

95
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:27,596
LIAM: New episode of Madness came out! We have
this guy to show. Oh! This is the shirt for Sagas

96
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:33,514
of Sundry: Madness. I am a Jenga pro! If you want
to learn how to play Jenga, you must watch Sagas

97
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:37,920
of Sundry: Madness. This eye glows in the fucking
dark.

98
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,569
JENNIFER: Let me see!

99
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,190
MATT: I like the idea that the Jenga catchphrase
from Critical Role was preparation for you to

100
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,551
actually be a Jenga master.

101
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,584
LIAM: I surprise myself, let me tell you!

102
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,352
TALIESIN: We loved our Dread shirts and were like,
it's a shame they don't glow! And they were like,

103
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,067
next time. And we're like, man!

104
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:55,339
LIAM: I think this is Ivan van Norman's eye. I
hope it's his eye.

105
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,586
MATT: It looks about right.

106
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:59,914
TALIESIN: It's the door of the house, right?

107
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:14,582
MATT: Some eldritch horrors are more horrible than
others. All right, guys. Happy to be back. We

108
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:19,862
missed you. Sorry for the chaos. Bringing it down,
we finished our announcements. That means tonight,

109
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:27,097
we step into the world of Azeroth as we prepare
for tonight's episode of Critical Role.

110
00:08:27,097 --> 00:09:59,389
[dramatic music]

111
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:08,939
MATT: And welcome back. So, as we bring ourselves
into this story-- I missed you guys.

112
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,399
JENNIFER: It's their fault!

113
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:28,581
MATT: It's okay. The Burning Legion has returned.
The world-conquering armies of the corrupt titan,

114
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:36,956
Sargeras, have assaulted Azeroth. The greatest
heroes of both the Alliance and the Horde have

115
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:42,711
gathered their resources to combat this
apocalyptic scourge. Traveling off to the Broken

116
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:49,684
Isles and to Argus beyond to fight for the
salvation of Azeroth, these heroes will be the

117
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:55,192
stuff of legend. While they're away, things are a
little slow down here in the Eastern Kingdoms for

118
00:10:55,192 --> 00:11:06,347
you guys, as a band of friends seeking to make a
name for yourselves. The streets of Ironforge grow

119
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:12,010
dull with fetch quests and baking runs. Gilneas'
biggest torment is a terrible flea infestation.

120
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,323
After Stormwind holds a pet-racing contest, which
you each individually lose, you gather your

121
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:23,701
frustration and head east in search of real
adventure, trudging through a mire of

122
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:29,161
uninteresting quests and aid to local farm-hands
and wandering merchants. You've all amassed some

123
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:34,688
equipment to aid you for the new challenges ahead.
Although the patchwork sources leave your gear

124
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:40,862
somewhat mismatched in color and make. Bundle, you
in particular seem to take pride in your

125
00:11:40,862 --> 00:11:44,583
lime-green robes that you were assured carried a
powerful enchantment.

126
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:49,161
TALIESIN: It's from a boutique!

127
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:55,082
MATT: Your troupe has now found your way to the
valley of the Red Ridge Mountains seeking solid

128
00:11:55,082 --> 00:12:00,943
work, only to find the work boards empty and the
wild beasts that roam the surrounding landscape

129
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:06,304
well in the hands of the local guard. You all sit
within the Lakeshire Inn, within the village of

130
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:12,899
Lakeshire, two cups into your woes as you lament
your life choices and clashing attire. The warm

131
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,526
interior is rather vacant outside of your band,
the hearth empty with naught but a smoldering log

132
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:24,057
to combat the chill morning air. That's right,
you're two cups in <i>for breakfast</i>. The innkeeper,

133
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:29,564
Brianna, yawns and leaves as the bartender, of
fiery-orange, shoulder-length hair and mustache,

134
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,464
walks over to deliver your next round of breakfast
drinks.

135
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:48,770
LAURA: Sure is chilly in this place, huh? Woo!
Maybe you can add another log, there?

136
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,550
MATT: "Over here, in the fireplace?"

137
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,425
LAURA: Yeah, in that hearth.

138
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:54,721
MATT: "I'll throw one on. Okay."

139
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:55,916
LAURA: Thanks!

140
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,143
MATT: "Let me know if you want another round."

141
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:03,005
LIAM: This is a little weak. Do you have anything
stronger than this?

142
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:06,000
MATT: "I can go look, but I got to do the log
thing first."

143
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,217
LIAM: All right. Log, then grog, yes?

144
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:14,549
TALIESIN: If you have a menu of breakfast beers,
that would be most gracious.

145
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:21,988
MATT: "All right." He looks a bit scattered but
goes off to put the log in the hearth. So, as we

146
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:26,004
go around the table, if you wouldn't mind taking a
moment to describe your character as you appear at

147
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,484
the table.

148
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:36,070
TRAVIS: Yes! I am Lohkor Windfallow, paladin.
Keeper of virtues and righteousness. I am

149
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,723
devilishly handsome, and I don't play well with
others because of that devilish handsomeness. But

150
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:50,298
my skills are always for sale and my fellows seem
to appreciate my roguish good looks.

151
00:13:50,298 --> 00:14:04,695
LAURA: You are quite handsome. Oh, hi! My name is
Greldamine Clypsol. I'm a gnome mage. I am short,

152
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:13,247
even for a gnome; I know. That's fine. I wear my
hair in a high bun. It's brown. I'm just the

153
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,888
biggest fan of Jaina Proudmore. I think she's just
the most amazing mage I've ever seen, you know. I

154
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:24,289
hear good things about her. She's so powerful
and beautiful. Sounds amazing, I hear. I don't

155
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:27,228
know, I haven't met her in person.

156
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:40,486
TALIESIN: I have to catch my breath. Okay. My name
is Bundle. I'm a dwarf. I've got a very, very nice

157
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,311
lime green robe.

158
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:43,489
LAURA: It's beautiful.

159
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:48,206
TALIESIN: Thank you, I'm very proud. I'm a priest
and I've been studying for quite some time.

160
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:54,339
Learning my trade, perfecting it. I'm a bit
behind. I mean, I've got some younger brothers

161
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,087
that are doing much better than I am, and
certainly they're succeeding more and going

162
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:07,095
further, and that's fine. I'm doing my best. I'm
taking my own pace. Going a bit bald and I'm

163
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:13,338
trying to do my best to bring it over, and it's
going into a-- it's not a great beard, but I use

164
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,488
the ham hocks to liven it up a bit.

165
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,646
TRAVIS: It's good. No, it frames your face very
well.

166
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:27,493
TALIESIN: And I feel like I'm making my way at my
own pace very well. More beer.

167
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:35,114
JENNIFER: I'm Aerwin Whiteclaw. It's been quite a
long time since I've been in this much company.

168
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:41,196
It's rather overwhelming. I am a night elf of the
rogue persuasion. I come from a long line of

169
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:47,058
rogues. I attempted to be rather more of a
businessperson and healer, but was quickly dragged

170
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:53,229
into the family business. I spend large amounts of
time alone, in the dark, by myself. I dress in

171
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:54,889
black. I prefer it that way.

172
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,312
(laughter)

173
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,746
TRAVIS: No reason to spend all that time by
yourself.

174
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,251
JENNIFER: Ready for another drink.

175
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,541
(laughter)

176
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:08,498
LIAM: Yes, my name is Quazirat Toluus.

177
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,932
LAURA: Quazirat <i>Toes</i>?

178
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:13,343
LIAM: Quazirat <i>Toluus</i>.

179
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,855
TALIESIN: All ten of them?

180
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:23,693
LIAM: All ten, yes. I am Draenei, wear all white
at all times, top and bottom, underneath and

181
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:34,491
front. Whole nine yards. I am simple man. I like
to test myself in battle for the glory of Argus.

182
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:43,939
Every day of my life for the glory of Argus. I
also like to sample the fine spirits of the realm,

183
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:53,962
and I am a big player of MMORPGs. I like to unwind
at night when I am done killing the Burning

184
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,459
Legion.

185
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,314
LAURA: What's your handle?

186
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:03,122
LIAM: It is LRJenkins1234.

187
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,286
LAURA: Creative. I like it.

188
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:16,637
MATT: At this point, the bartender comes by this
time with the next round of drinks. The one log he

189
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:20,202
placed in there is starting to catch a little bit,
but it's cold enough in the morning where it's

190
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:24,902
taken a little while. The smoke's billowing up,
bit of it dribbling past the top of the fireplace

191
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:30,821
and hitting, what you can see, is a casual stain
of gray that reaches the roof of the interior of

192
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:37,153
the tavern above it. As he sets it down, he goes,
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. But based

193
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:44,146
"on your conversation and attire, I can see that
you seem to be aspiring problem solvers. Is that

194
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,540
"right?"

195
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,992
TRAVIS: I guess so, that <i>does</i> describe us,
doesn't it?

196
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:48,750
JENNIFER: I suppose.

197
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:56,062
MATT: "Wonderful. Well, I'm the bartender here.
And my name is Wental. I happen to have a problem

198
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:03,467
"that's in need of saving, friends, and solving.
You see this inn, it's been in my family for

199
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:11,182
"generations, left to me by my late father. And
while it does keep me busy," and he looks around

200
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:19,882
to a very empty tavern around you, "extremely busy,
my passions lie elsewhere. My hobby, my greatest

201
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:23,541
"of loves, is being a smear monger."

202
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,587
TRAVIS: A what?

203
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:29,301
MATT: "A smear monger."

204
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,111
LAURA: That sounds great.

205
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,064
MATT: "A smear monger, a chandler, crafter of
light."

206
00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:34,436
LAURA: Of course!

207
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,057
MATT: "A candlemaker!"

208
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,619
TRAVIS, LAURA, TALIESIN: Oh!

209
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,451
LAURA: What kind of candles?

210
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,951
MATT: "Oh, all kinds of candles: scented,
colorful, sizes, long wicks, short wicks."

211
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,438
TRAVIS: Explosive?

212
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:49,736
MATT: "No, but I haven't dabbled, either."

213
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:50,999
JENNIFER: Any black ones?

214
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:57,530
MATT: "Ah, that'll bring us to the crux of our
conversation. There <i>were</i>. I've been hoarding all

215
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,615
"of the oils and fats from the kitchen since I was
a boy, slowly learning to build a stock and keep

216
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:07,859
"it beneath my bed, and eventually moving it to a
shed offsite. Reading what books I can in secret.

217
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:14,329
"If my father knew my interests in candle making...
anyway." And you can see his eyes begin to well up

218
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:22,502
a bit and his hands are shaking. "I went to go to
my storage shed after buying a small homestead in

219
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:30,282
"Goldshire and hoping to open a shop at some point
in the future. It's all gone. All of it! Just

220
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:36,775
"gone! Every. Single. Candle I've made! Gone!"

221
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,753
LAURA: Even your fat stores?

222
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:47,198
MATT: "Well the fat stores are normally stored in
there, but they've gone bad since. I asked for it

223
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:50,897
"to be investigated, but the guard laughed at me.
They have no appreciation for fine candlework."

224
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:56,553
You notice, across the room, one of the other
women who are in there who's the local voyeur

225
00:19:56,553 --> 00:20:01,931
chuckles under her breath and she eats her cold
toast and stays at the table. Wental shoots her an

226
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:09,200
icy dagger glance and back to you. "I ask, if you
would help retrieve my life's work, I would

227
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:18,190
"greatly make it worth your while. I have my
savings, which isn't much, about 520 gold pieces.

228
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,397
"And I could probably muster some armor that
matches."

229
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:24,976
LAURA: That'd be great!

230
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:26,498
MATT: "What do you say?"

231
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,764
LAURA: Do you have robes?

232
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:29,175
MATT: "That could be arranged."

233
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,588
TALIESIN: Doesn't have to match.

234
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:35,845
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we should present a united
front, though. I mean, people should be able to

235
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,440
see that we are a group.

236
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,206
JENNIFER: As long as it's black.

237
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,763
LIAM: As long as it's white.

238
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:43,459
TALIESIN: As long as it's lime green.

239
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,206
LAURA: I'm partial to purple.

240
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:51,201
MATT: "I'll see what I can do about dye colors.
I'll have to send away, possibly to Westfall. They

241
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:57,473
"have some good dyers there. But if you agree to
this, then the sooner we can get off the better!"

242
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:03,075
And he twirls his mustache with both of his
fingers, a nervous tick or an exclamation of

243
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,328
physicality. "Shall we?"

244
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,561
JENNIFER: I'll agree as long as you never do that
again.

245
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,672
MATT: "Very well."

246
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:12,858
TALIESIN: There was a fisherman who did like 25 of
those little red plants, but this sounds better.

247
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:19,004
LAURA: This sounds fun! Wental, you can count on
us! I jump on top of the table and raise my fist

248
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,819
into the air.

249
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,459
JENNIFER: I shrink into my chair.

250
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:25,096
MATT: He awkwardly reaches out and side fistbumps,
not sure what to do.

251
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:26,839
LAURA: Candles!

252
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,698
MATT: "I like her!"

253
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:33,376
TRAVIS: I'm sure this morning's fare will be also
a part of our arrangement?

254
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,384
MATT: "Sure."

255
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:39,675
LIAM: And I was going to ask for a couple bottles
of your best vintage to be added to the agreed

256
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,133
upon price.

257
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,620
TRAVIS and JENNIFER: Yes.

258
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,517
MATT: "Very well. I'll be happy to place it upon
your tab that will be wiped clean upon the

259
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,356
"retrieval of my candles."

260
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,912
JENNIFER: A steed or two. I saw something out back
that looked rather suitable.

261
00:21:52,912 --> 00:22:01,803
MATT: "I'll see what I can do. I only have so much
I can do in the town, but let me try. Anyway." And

262
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:07,274
he rushes off. He comes back and he brings you two
bottles of wine, not the greatest. You don't get a

263
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:12,305
lot of decent import over here on Lakeshore,
unfortunately. It's a little out of the way.

264
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,973
LIAM: Will it mess me up?

265
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,822
MATT: "If you were to chug it now, most likely!"

266
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,638
LIAM: That's a deal.

267
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:22,567
MATT: "All righty. Follow me. I'll take you to the
shed. See if you can learn anything."

268
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,214
LAURA: Great.

269
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:33,856
MATT: So Wental guides you outside the Lakeshore
Inn, around the back and up past some bushes.

270
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:37,809
There's a number of trees that crest right against
the base of the Red Ridge Mountains, just above

271
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,637
the location of the inn. As he comes around, you
can see there's the one stable off to the side. He

272
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:49,741
goes, "I'll talk to them and see what I can do.
But to be honest, the stable master and me don't

273
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:51,510
"really get along."

274
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,270
JENNIFER: Just show me where he is. I'm sure we
can work something out.

275
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:01,436
MATT: "Very well. Should I take you to the shed
first, or do you need your steed now?"

276
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,599
LAURA: Maybe to the shed since it's close.

277
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,641
JENNIFER: We can go to the shed. I don't want to
make the small one run.

278
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:11,475
LAURA: Thank you.

279
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:14,500
MATT: "I don't mind. All right." And you see he
seems to have confidence around the gnome. And

280
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,279
then he gets really sheepish in the gaze of the
night elf who stares down and probably stands a

281
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:26,289
good six inches taller than him. So he leads you
up past this section to the base of the mountains

282
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:31,605
and you can see there's a really nice-looking shed
that's settled between the edge of the mountains

283
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:36,416
and a tree over there. It's closed, it's locked
up, there's chains. But as you walk up, you can

284
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:40,147
see that the actual lock has been broken and the
chains dangle off to the sides of the two doors

285
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:42,333
that open up into it.

286
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,385
TALIESIN: There's your trouble. You left it
unlocked.

287
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,498
TRAVIS: I think someone broke the lock.

288
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:54,626
TALIESIN: You're making assumptions, I feel.
That's a lot to just assume, just taking your

289
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,096
first look.

290
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:59,870
MATT: (squeak) He opens the front doors to the
shed and upon looking inside, you can see there

291
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:06,697
are shelves arranged. There are small crates that
have been pried open. Across the entirety of the

292
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:12,729
floor you see scraps of wax scattered here and
there, large spaces where apparently clusters of

293
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:18,499
it were set and have since been pulled. And it is
entirely empty and scraped of any possible

294
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:24,746
remainder of wax. And there's a sudden smell that
comes out, too. It could be a combination of

295
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:32,949
either rotting animal bits and/or some element of
fecal matter. It's hard to really pick out. But

296
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:34,522
it's not a pleasant interior.

297
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:41,016
LIAM: Are there any markings, footprints,
different toe patterns, any kind of clues?

298
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:45,989
MATT: "I looked everywhere and saw nothing. I'm
also a bartender and that's why I asked you guys.

299
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:48,189
"So if you want to have a look, please!"

300
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:51,517
LIAM: Yeah. I was actually asking the DM.

301
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:54,869
MATT: Oh, okay.

302
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,915
LIAM: Do I see, with my Draenei eyes, as I stroke
my chin tentacles--

303
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:05,164
LAURA: You have tentacles?! You have tentacles on
your chin?

304
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:08,235
LIAM: On my chin. I don't like to draw attention
to them.

305
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:12,199
TRAVIS: You don't need to. They're just there.

306
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:17,868
MATT: So are you getting to the ground?

307
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:19,235
LIAM: That's right.

308
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:20,843
MATT: Make an investigation check.

309
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:28,912
LIAM: Yes. I'm making an investigation check. I'm
rolling a d20. That's not very good. That is, hold

310
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:32,009
on! I've just solved the entire game. That's a
two.

311
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:36,444
MATT: You get close to the ground and there's a
lot of small bits of wax. And you start pulling

312
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:40,623
them together and piecing them, and you figure if
you spend the next couple hours, you can maybe put

313
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,674
together a very small candle.

314
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,470
LIAM: There were candles here.

315
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,246
MATT: You are correct.

316
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:50,533
TRAVIS: Quazi, you are astute, as always. Bundle,
would you mind checking the lock to see if

317
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,950
there's--?

318
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,399
TALIESIN: I take a look at the lock.

319
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:55,944
MATT: Make an investigation check.

320
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:58,602
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Oh, wow.

321
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:01,996
TRAVIS: Oh, no. It's cold in here.

322
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:05,755
LAURA: Warm it up, guys!

323
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,119
TALIESIN: Seven?

324
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,435
MATT: Seven? The lock appears to have been broken
through blunt force, but you have no other

325
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:14,518
information you can draw from it.

326
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:18,961
TALIESIN: Lock appears to have been broken by
blunt force. I don't know.

327
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,870
JENNIFER: Let me have a look.

328
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,012
MATT: All right, if you want to go ahead and make
an investigation check as well.

329
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:33,073
LIAM: That's a good idea. Okay, that's better than
us. So you go from there to there, and add that.

330
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,479
JENNIFER: So it's 13.

331
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:41,647
MATT: 13? So as you start glancing around, first
things first. When you get closer to the ground

332
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:48,390
and elements of the doorway, you can smell in the
air, it's almost like a wet fur scent in the air.

333
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,371
And as you glance towards the edge of the shed's
opening in the mud and dirt that surrounds the

334
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:59,911
exterior, you can see faint foot tracks smattering
in different directions. Many of them. There's

335
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:06,745
multiple sets. Soled shoes, or boots of some kind.
But it looks almost like there's also a toe or two

336
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:15,470
protruding from the front. Smaller than a man's
feet. They lead away from the shed and then

337
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,349
further up the mountain range to the westward
direction.

338
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:28,193
JENNIFER: I've seen these before. It's been a long
time. It was very far from here. I hesitate to

339
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:34,206
name it. I'll leave that to the Dungeon Master.
It's my first game!

340
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:41,979
LIAM: You can also tell there were candles here,
yes?

341
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:45,141
JENNIFER: Yes. I can smell there were candles
here.

342
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:51,537
MATT: So, go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
intelligence modifier to this one. So, look at

343
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,623
your intelligence. Liam, want to help her with the
intelligence modifier?

344
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:57,089
LIAM: Intelligence modifier is up here, yeah? Five
plus--

345
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,305
JENNIFER: So, 13.

346
00:27:58,305 --> 00:27:59,960
MATT: That's a saving throw.

347
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,448
LIAM: Oh, so intelligence check, you say?
Intelligence check? Well, then it's just that

348
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:08,569
plus-- where the hell is it? There it is.

349
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:09,997
JENNIFER: Ten!

350
00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:16,193
MATT: Ten? Okay. You recall seeing tracks like
this before but the name is on the tip of your

351
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,026
tongue. You're not entirely certain what it could
be.

352
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:20,665
JENNIFER: The name's on the tip of my tongue and I
can't quite grab it. Can someone else grab it for

353
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,441
me?

354
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,765
TRAVIS: Yes. Let me see if I recognize these
tracks.

355
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:30,479
LAURA: Does anyone know that you make candles?
Other than your father?

356
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:34,421
MATT: "Well, he doesn't know yet. I was going to
open the store first and have him come take a look

357
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,647
"at it."

358
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,736
LAURA: Oh, okay. So you don't have any candle
enemies?

359
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:42,195
MATT: "I don't believe so. Not in this town. There
isn't a candlemaker, not anymore."

360
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:46,071
LAURA: And are your candles scented?

361
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,602
MATT: "Some of them were."

362
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:50,279
LAURA: Do most of them smell like animal fat?

363
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:57,145
MATT: "Yes, they do, by their very nature. But I
try best to add lavender to the batch and

364
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,910
"occasionally--"

365
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,320
JENNIFER: Lavender, you say?

366
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,457
MATT: "Yes, lavender."

367
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:03,352
LIAM: What about paht-pourri?

368
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:07,477
TRAVIS: We've discussed this. It's <i>potpourri</i>.

369
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:09,115
LIAM: You're dropping off the T.

370
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,847
TRAVIS: Well, it's just potpourri.

371
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:13,310
LIAM: You're fucking with me.

372
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,008
TRAVIS: No, for the fourth time.

373
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:17,514
LAURA: Were you going to track them?

374
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,624
TRAVIS: I'd like to try.

375
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,795
MATT: Make a survival check.

376
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,520
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

377
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,627
LAURA: Is that with your Grog dice?

378
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,351
TRAVIS: With my die!

379
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:36,697
MATT: You watch as the armored human paladin gets
low. His eyes suddenly spark! As he looks to the

380
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:40,798
left, looks to the right, looks down to the
ground, and, almost like a hound dog, begins

381
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,876
trailing this track curving around the shed into
the west as you guys slowly follow suit.

382
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:51,117
TALIESIN: This is why we pay him big gold bucks
right there.

383
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:55,009
TRAVIS: And because I'm handsome.

384
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:59,278
MATT: As you guys follow, Wental stays a few steps
behind. He seems excited, but also not sure what

385
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,056
you guys are going to discover and you can see the
tension rising in him. His shoulders are slowly

386
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:05,355
creeping up across the sides of his head.

387
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:10,050
LAURA: Yes, we're clearly much more experienced
fighters than you are.

388
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:19,168
MATT: "I completely agree. I hope." At this point
you catch up to your human paladin friend over

389
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:25,901
there and you find the tracks lead up to a large
cluster of bushes that are embedded right in the

390
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:36,758
base of the mountain range. They're thorny.
They're dry. It's a small bramble cluster. It's

391
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:40,960
about five or so feet up. It's a wide chunk and
you can see bits and pieces of it scattered across

392
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,797
the edge of the mountain range here. As you get
closer you can see some of the jagged edges of the

393
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:50,970
boosh have a faint-- A boosh. The boosh.

394
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,165
TRAVIS: Are you amused by the boosh?

395
00:30:54,165 --> 00:31:09,389
MATT: You find the boosh rather amusing. On the
jagged edges of the bush you see faint elements of

396
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,149
a waxy residue that have been scraped onto some of
the thorns of the brambles.

397
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:15,341
LIAM: Probably unrelated.

398
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:21,537
MATT: Just beyond you can barely see a dark
recess, about four feet tall and about four feet

399
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:24,514
wide, behind the bush, that presses into the
mountain range.

400
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:31,676
TRAVIS: The tracks lead to this bush. If you see
just beyond there's a recess in the mountains.

401
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:33,517
LAURA: How big is the recess?

402
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,676
TRAVIS: It's like four-- what is it? How far
about?

403
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:40,712
MATT: Four foot wide and four foot tall.

404
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:44,248
LAURA: Oh. That's small for a human.

405
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:46,106
TRAVIS: Indeed it is.

406
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:50,728
LAURA: So I wonder if these creatures who stole
the candles are smaller than humans.

407
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:55,023
TRAVIS: My hypothesis exactly.

408
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,783
TALIESIN: Or they're prone to crawling.

409
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,087
LAURA: Oh, or that.

410
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:02,939
TALIESIN: They could be crawlers. That's some mean
crawlers.

411
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:08,357
JENNIFER: Gren-- Grel-- Greldamin?

412
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:14,759
LAURA: Greldamine. It's okay, it's a hard name.
Especially for elves.

413
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:21,255
(laughter)

414
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:23,878
JENNIFER: It looks like you could stand upright in
that hole.

415
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:26,135
LAURA: I could.

416
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:31,448
JENNIFER: Yes. It's another element we should
factor into our search.

417
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:35,472
LAURA: Should I go in? Should we all go in?

418
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:37,016
LIAM: You first, little one.

419
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:40,653
LAURA: Gladly. Can we move these thorny bushes out
of the way though?

420
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:44,459
TRAVIS: Absolutely. I start ripping the dried
brush out of the--

421
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:48,183
MATT: The brush is actually not attached to the
ground. It comes and pulls out of the way really

422
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,445
easily.

423
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,320
JENNIFER: Does he fall on his butt when he pulls
on it that hard?

424
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,449
MATT: He almost does. He teeters on one foot as
his sheer show of strength to tear them out

425
00:32:55,449 --> 00:33:00,559
overcompensates and his armored self, being top
heavy as he is, he stands there and awkwardly

426
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:08,808
wobbles in place. And for a moment you see as the
bartender, Wental, swallows deeply out of the

427
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:11,040
choice of companions that he's hired for this.

428
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,352
LAURA: Wental, are you coming with us?

429
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:14,033
MATT: "Oh goodness no!"

430
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,284
TRAVIS: Are you sure? We have extra daggers and
all sorts of things.

431
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:23,014
MATT: "I have a job. It's busy. Lot of people in
there. I need to make drinks and breakfast. I

432
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:26,205
"hired you to do this for me. Please do this for
me."

433
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,731
LAURA: Of course, yes, don't worry.

434
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:30,588
TRAVIS: We will take care of this and be back
expediently. You can count on us!

435
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:31,952
MATT: "Wonderful, thank you."

436
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,284
JENNIFER: Please have dinner ready.

437
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:40,548
MATT: "Yes ma'am." You can't tell if he's crushing
or legitimately super frightened but, "Good

438
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:42,036
"luck!"

439
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,576
JENNIFER: One and the same.

440
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:49,397
MATT: So pulling the brush out of the way, you can
see this has been a deliberately-dug cavern that

441
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,973
recedes into the mountain and into darkness.

442
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,914
LAURA: Hello!

443
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:59,197
MATT: (imitates echo) It does echo a bit.

444
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:01,058
TRAVIS: Can you see in the dark?

445
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:10,491
LAURA: Yes, but I also have Light! And I send
Light down the tunnel. Can I do that? Can I send

446
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:12,956
Light down the tunnel or does it light up around
me?

447
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:14,960
MATT: Well, you choose an object to then light up
like it was a torch.

448
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,909
LAURA: Oh, what do we have on us?

449
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,763
TRAVIS: I have a torch. I have ten of them.

450
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:22,086
LAURA: Oh. Well we should probably just use a
torch then.

451
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:24,068
LIAM: There's also rocks on the ground.

452
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:29,382
LAURA: Oh! I'll pick up a rock and cast Light on
the rock! That was a good idea,

453
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:31,073
Whatever-Your-Toes!

454
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:38,106
LIAM: Yes. Is there room for our World of Warcraft
pauldrons to go into this space?

455
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:44,113
MATT: Four foot wide? At your size? Barely. It
scrapes the edges as you push inward, digging two

456
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:45,963
small grooves along the cavern.

457
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:50,778
JENNIFER: Let's send him first. Someone push him
from behind.

458
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:55,772
TALIESIN: Grease it up and he'll squeeze right in
there.

459
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,241
JENNIFER: There's candle wax around.

460
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:00,098
TALIESIN: Wax the corners and push him through.

461
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:05,759
LIAM: Either the small magic one or the sneaky one
should be going first, I think, yes?

462
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:08,268
JENNIFER: Well she can stand upright.

463
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:09,530
LAURA: I'll go first.

464
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,905
LIAM: All right little stinker, let's see what you
can do.

465
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,957
MATT: All right, so Greldamine, as you light up
the rock in your hand and it's giving off this

466
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:21,943
bright torch light, you hold it in front of you
and you walk right into it. As soon as you begin

467
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:27,162
to step into the chamber you can already feel
there's a faint cold breeze blowing from the open

468
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:33,762
world behind you into the chamber. You're drawn
deeper and deeper into the darkness within as it

469
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:40,293
begins to faintly grade into a descent. What's the
order in which you guys are traveling behind her?

470
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:42,624
LAURA: Oh jeez, this is so dumb that I'm in the
front.

471
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:44,895
MATT and LAURA: What do you mean?

472
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:48,256
LAURA: With my 37 hit points.

473
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:50,654
TRAVIS: You're so squishy!

474
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:52,134
TALIESIN: We're all a little squishy.

475
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,136
TRAVIS: To make you feel better I will be second.

476
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,139
LAURA: Okay.

477
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,369
TALIESIN: I'll go right in the middle.

478
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,516
JENNIFER: If you'd like a wall behind us, I'll go
after him.

479
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:05,440
LIAM: All right. Dramamine, lead the way.

480
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:14,985
MATT: As you continue delving deeper down this
cavern, the smell of damp earth seems to be ever

481
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:19,294
present as a recent rainfall has left a lot of
this path, the early portion of it, rather muddy.

482
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:25,148
Your feet slip and slick against the soft floor as
you occasionally have to right yourself against

483
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:30,799
the walls of the cavern, being careful as you push
deeper into this. Now after some time the path

484
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:36,571
comes to an abrupt halt where the floor seems to
drop down about five feet into a tunnel that opens

485
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:40,224
larger and wider, 15 feet below you, deeper still
into the mountain.

486
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:44,680
LAURA: Shh! Can I hear anything?

487
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,335
MATT: Make a perception check.

488
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:54,899
LAURA: Ooh! 23.

489
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:56,011
TRAVIS: Wow.

490
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:03,334
MATT: What little bit of wind is passing through
down into the cavern, you can hear what sounds

491
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:15,635
like a faint rock falling. Some scraping sounds
and a door slam, distant, below you, and distant.

492
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:21,559
JENNIFER: Might this be a good time for some
shadow melding?

493
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,247
LAURA: What is that?

494
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:26,949
MATT: It's up to you. You can only use it once per
short rest so keep that in mind. If there's

495
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:30,760
nothing currently around you can still stealth
whenever you want to.

496
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,523
JENNIFER: I'm inclined to stealth.

497
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:33,762
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can stealth.

498
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,242
JENNIFER: I'm inclined to stealth.

499
00:37:35,242 --> 00:37:37,017
MATT: Okay, so yeah, go ahead and roll a stealth
check.

500
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:38,639
JENNIFER: I'll be the stealth person. All right
so--

501
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,317
LAURA: We can all try to stealth right now if you
want to.

502
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:42,876
LIAM: It would be better because here's the thing,
even if you are supremely sneaky which you are,

503
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:46,856
I'm fucking bullshit with sneaking so we all have
to, you know, pull our weight.

504
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:50,771
LAURA: Maybe you'll roll a 20.

505
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:56,091
LIAM: We'll see how I do. Three!

506
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:59,830
JENNIFER: 28.

507
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:09,677
MATT: Your darker night elf complexion vanishes
into the shadows-- there you go. I love it.

508
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,569
TALIESIN: 15.

509
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:13,189
LAURA: 13.

510
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:14,328
TRAVIS: 13 as well.

511
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:15,997
LIAM: And I lied. Five.

512
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:21,891
MATT: That makes a difference. All right so, as
you guys all quietly look down into this small

513
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:26,048
cavern it drops down, you're looking over the
edge--

514
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,326
LAURA: Like five feet?

515
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:30,258
MATT: Like five, six feet down below you jump down
if you want to.

516
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:31,832
LAURA: Should we jump down?

517
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:33,074
LIAM: Yeah! They'll never see us coming!

518
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:34,704
(shushing)

519
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:40,743
JENNIFER: Put a sock in it. So I suppose I should
go ahead. I'm going to sneak ahead because I'm the

520
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:42,879
sneaky one in this one. All right, I'm sneaking
ahead.

521
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,973
MATT: As you guys all leap down into the tunnel
below you--

522
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:49,595
JENNIFER: Oh, oh! (grunt)

523
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:57,823
MATT: Okay. Said that, you all leap in afterward.
You go ahead and begin to sneak ahead a bit and it

524
00:38:57,823 --> 00:39:03,767
switches back a bit and goes into a much more
steady decline in the direction of where you came

525
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:04,771
from below.

526
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,168
JENNIFER: Is it slippery?

527
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,864
MATT: It's actually much drier now. You're further
away from the cavern entrance, it looks like the

528
00:39:07,864 --> 00:39:09,090
water--

529
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,516
JENNIFER: It's much drier here. I'm going ahead. I
smell something. It's very familiar, but my

530
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:17,853
intelligence is not as high as I'd like so I can't
remember what it is.

531
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:20,408
TALIESIN: Lavender.

532
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,546
LAURA: Ooh.

533
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:23,317
JENNIFER: It smells like lavender. It does, good
reminder.

534
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:24,418
LAURA: Does it?

535
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:25,721
MATT: You don't smell lavender as well--

536
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,870
TALIESIN: No? Never mind, that's just me being a
nuisance.

537
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,284
JENNIFER: I don't smell lavender, I take that
back.

538
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,321
MATT: But you--

539
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,144
JENNIFER: Stop it, I'm new.

540
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:37,532
MATT: You do begin to hear as you begin your
approach what sounds like faint rushing water.

541
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:39,827
JENNIFER: I hear rushing water.

542
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,577
MATT: And you see ahead as you're pushing
forward-- are you guys following behind her?

543
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:46,821
LAURA: Yeah, no, we're following, we're following.

544
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,557
MATT: So like, hanging about 20 feet or so back?

545
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:49,805
LAURA: Yeah.

546
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,406
MATT: Eventually the path begins to curve to the
left and you can see a faint source of light that

547
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:56,638
begins to emerge around the corner as you begin to
curve around.

548
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:59,240
LAURA: (whispering) What does it look like?

549
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:06,907
JENNIFER: (whispering) It looks like a long thin
ray of light. Vertical, I think. I've been waiting

550
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,509
to find out if I'm right.

551
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,126
TRAVIS: Are you making this up?

552
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,919
JENNIFER: I am, totally. Am I allowed? Am I
allowed to do that?

553
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,078
LAURA: No!

554
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,895
JENNIFER: Oh, I'll stop now. I don't know this
game yet.

555
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:19,387
LIAM: What happens is he will create the
environment and the things around you and you

556
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:22,088
interact with them and you roll dice occasionally.

557
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,891
JENNIFER: I'm going to go under here for a
minute.

558
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:29,494
LIAM: You're in control of your personality and
the actions you do in this world. He's the world.

559
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,948
JENNIFER: I don't know, do I see any light?

560
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:35,127
MATT: So as you coast around the corner go ahead
and make a perception check.

561
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:36,595
JENNIFER: Okay.

562
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:43,208
LIAM: There it is. Oh that's shnazzy. Yeah. What
is that?

563
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,999
JENNIFER: (counting) 18.

564
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:48,377
MATT: All right, so as you coast around the
corner, placing your hand along the edge of the

565
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:55,310
cavern you glance over and you can see the hallway
opens up into a much larger chamber of natural

566
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:03,536
stone formations and stalactites litter the roof
above you, the cavern top. There's about 20 feet

567
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:07,822
beyond this entrance, an underground river that is
stretching across from one side to the other

568
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:14,692
before diving in and vanishing beneath the rock
wall on the far right side. Crossing this small

569
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:20,991
recess where the water seems to be rushing, you
can see the occasional mist and spray from wayward

570
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:27,385
rocks that are breaking up the flow of the river.
Two rickety wood plank bridges that cross past it

571
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:35,341
are attached and nailed into portions of the rock,
and then right across, you can see the source of

572
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:40,786
light. There's a number of sources of light that
are slightly shifting on the opposite end of the

573
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:47,486
chamber. There's another platform on the other end
of the river where you can see roughly nine nasty

574
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:54,403
looking humanoid creatures that are clustered with
patches of fur on portions of their body. They

575
00:41:54,403 --> 00:42:01,581
carry satchels and packs. A single, melting lit
candle rests atop each of their heads as their

576
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:04,563
light source in these dark tunnels.

577
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,051
LAURA: That's really cute.

578
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:09,644
MATT: You now recognize what was on the tip of
your tongue. These are definitely kobolds and they

579
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:13,233
appear to have been coming through a door that is
now closed and being locked on the opposite side

580
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:18,251
by one of them that is larger. They're carrying
these large sacks and they're all talking amongst

581
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:22,968
each other. You can see their features are
somewhat rat-like and their protruded snouts,

582
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:27,597
whiskers that shoot off to each side. They haven't
noticed your presence yet.

583
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,991
LAURA: How tall are they?

584
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:32,191
MATT: About three and a half, four feet?

585
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:33,853
LAURA: So they're taller than I am.

586
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,144
MATT: Mm-hmm.

587
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,719
LAURA: I put my rock out.

588
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,677
MATT: Okay, so your light source vanishes.

589
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:40,723
LAURA: Yeah.

590
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:45,129
LIAM: And we've been trailing the elf, so--

591
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:49,188
JENNIFER: Now we're in the clear, so I'm going to
step back.

592
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:55,428
LAURA: What should we do? How many of them are
there?

593
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:59,649
TALIESIN and JENNIFER: (counting) One, two, three,
four.

594
00:42:59,649 --> 00:43:01,412
TRAVIS: Nine.

595
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,750
LAURA: Nine? There's about nine of them. Okay. Do
you think we could take nine of them?

596
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,202
JENNIFER: Yeah.

597
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:09,613
TRAVIS: Of course.

598
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:11,478
LAURA: Has anybody tried talking to kobolds
before?

599
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,268
TRAVIS: I haven't.

600
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:14,923
TALIESIN: I've never talked to one before.

601
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:18,374
JENNIFER: If our mission is to bring the candles
home, what would happen to the candles if we took

602
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:21,741
them out in a violent manner? Would they be
damaged, would that--

603
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:24,219
TRAVIS: Did we ask how many candles were missing?
Boxes of them.

604
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:26,027
LAURA: An entire shed's worth!

605
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:34,894
LIAM: I think it was more than nine so like ten
candles. Eleven, probably. We'll find out if we

606
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:35,831
kill them.

607
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:39,671
LAURA: I wonder if these are actual candles or if
these are old candles and they stole his candles

608
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:44,247
for new candles because the candles on their head
are wearing down, do you know what I mean?

609
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,579
LIAM: You just said candles a lot of times.

610
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:50,027
TRAVIS: Who's feeling particularly sneaky right
now?

611
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,637
LAURA: I can be invisible.

612
00:43:51,637 --> 00:43:59,508
TRAVIS: That's right. Feel like journeying in a
little bit? Seeing what else you can see?

613
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:05,611
LAURA: Sure. Sure! I cast Invisibility on myself.

614
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:16,537
MATT: Okay. You watch as the outside of your
gnomish companion shimmers and then vanishes. You

615
00:44:16,537 --> 00:44:19,234
find yourself invisible and you step carefully.

616
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:21,399
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to walk across the bridge
now.

617
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,083
JENNIFER: We can still hear you.

618
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,869
LAURA: Yeah. I'll be quiet once I get <i>towards</i>
the bridge.

619
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:30,404
TRAVIS: See if you can see any of the other
candles.

620
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:35,742
LAURA: I walk towards one of the rickety bridges.

621
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:39,907
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a stealth check with
advantage because you're invisible.

622
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:47,475
LAURA: Ooh. Yeah. 22.

623
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:52,743
MATT: Okay. As you carefully make your way over
towards the edge of the bridge you can see the

624
00:44:52,743 --> 00:44:58,573
water is about a foot and a half, two feet below
where the bridge is and it's not rushing super

625
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:03,269
fast but enough where it's breaking the water a
bit, you're seeing a bit of spray and mist and you

626
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:10,206
see these nine kobold creatures across the way. It
looks like the one that was locking the door is

627
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:14,213
currently talking and giving instructions to the
others as you see the larger one is standing there

628
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:20,887
with this massive pack on his back that's filled
to the brim. All of them are carrying pickaxes to

629
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:27,435
the side, but he has the wicked, more strongly
built one. As he's pointing to them he's talking.

630
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:31,187
Make a perception check.

631
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,187
LAURA: Oh, natural 20! Ha!

632
00:45:33,187 --> 00:45:34,529
MATT: Nice.

633
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:38,947
So you can hear faintly what he's
instructing is, "Stop complaining. We've gots to

634
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:45,940
"get these tunnels boom-booming before more cursed
people come. Now you, place there, you place

635
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:53,210
"there, me, I place everywhere else." And they all
begin to scatter a bit and make their way towards

636
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,497
the two bridges to begin to cross over in the
direction of you.

637
00:45:55,497 --> 00:46:03,594
LAURA: Oh no! Oh god, and I start backing up
towards my companions. I run towards them and say

638
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,868
They're on their way over here! They're going to
blow things up! I think the big one has the bag of

639
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,318
candles on his back!

640
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:11,317
TRAVIS: You sure you heard <i>blow</i> things up?

641
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:13,301
LAURA: Yeah, he said something about blowing
things up!

642
00:46:13,301 --> 00:46:14,763
LIAM: Where are you?

643
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:21,705
LAURA: I'm right here! I punch him in the knee. I
could've punched something else.

644
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:24,079
TRAVIS: We've got to stop them. There's nine of
them.

645
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,357
LAURA: We can do it!

646
00:46:25,357 --> 00:46:26,688
TRAVIS: There's five of us.

647
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:29,966
LAURA: What if we take out one of the bridges
while they're on the bridge?! Cut the rope and

648
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:32,294
then some of them that are on the bridge will
fall!

649
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:36,419
MATT: While you're having this conversation two of
them have just now finished traversing the bridge.

650
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,245
LAURA and TRAVIS: Shit.

651
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:40,480
LAURA: Quick! Go cut the bridge!

652
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,973
TRAVIS: Go cut the bridge?

653
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,616
LAURA: Cut the rope on the bridge!

654
00:46:43,616 --> 00:46:45,727
JENNIFER: Can I take them out while--

655
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,566
MATT: If you'd like to.

656
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:48,828
LIAM: This is the time.

657
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:50,239
JENNIFER: This is the time to take them out.

658
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,221
MATT: All right, so as they're having this
conversation you pull around the corner with your

659
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:56,576
hand crossbow and make a shot at the closest one
to you. You see one of the kobolds lumbering up,

660
00:46:56,576 --> 00:47:01,157
he's reaching into his satchel and he's pulling
out a small rod of some kind. Go ahead and roll an

661
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:01,981
attack.

662
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:04,424
LIAM: All right. And it's at advantage because
she's hiding, yeah?

663
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:05,453
MATT: Exactly.

664
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:09,903
LIAM: Yeah, so roll it twice and take the higher
one. So it's a 17 plus your attack from the

665
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:12,877
crossbow is a 25.

666
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:15,248
JENNIFER: 26. 17 plus nine.

667
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:16,872
MATT: Oh that most definitely hits.

668
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:17,950
LIAM: Plus eight.

669
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,573
JENNIFER: Oh sorry, plus eight, sorry, yes, right.
25.

670
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:21,770
MATT: That most definitely hits. So go ahead and
roll damage on that with sneak attack damage.

671
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,257
LIAM: So the damage is a 1d6, so you roll one of
those cubes.

672
00:47:25,257 --> 00:47:27,140
JENNIFER: One?

673
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,358
LIAM: Okay, three plus your sneak attack damage
which is at your level--

674
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:34,933
LAURA: Probably 1d6. 2d6 maybe?

675
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:38,197
MATT: It's 4d6. It's under the attack.

676
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:39,574
JENNIFER: There it is. 4d6.

677
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:40,916
LAURA: 4d6?! What level are we?!

678
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,406
MATT: Level seven.

679
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:43,814
LAURA: Oh shit.

680
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:45,605
JENNIFER: So I add ten. 17.

681
00:47:45,605 --> 00:47:47,066
LIAM: Plus the five.

682
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,267
JENNIFER: So 22.

683
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:53,011
MATT: 22 points of damage. So, as that one crosses
the way it pulls out its rod and (grunting)

684
00:47:53,011 --> 00:48:02,285
(arrow whooshing) (cry of pain) and goes straight down,
limp, drunk ET style, on the ground, slams face

685
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:04,429
first and is done.

686
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:06,327
JENNIFER: We need to get the other one now don't
we?

687
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:10,622
MATT: At this point, the one that just finished
crossing the bridge on the other side goes "Cera!

688
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:18,126
"Get up!" Walks over and kicks him. Then looks over
and sees you holding the hand crossbow and goes

689
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,542
(screaming).

690
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:23,018
TALIESIN: Do I have time to get one attack in?

691
00:48:23,018 --> 00:48:24,997
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative.

692
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:26,065
(groaning)

693
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,326
JENNIFER: What's initiative?

694
00:48:27,326 --> 00:48:29,871
LIAM: So we're seeing what the order is so roll 20
again and add this. And then keep that number in

695
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:34,286
your head. For a moment. You changed it, roll it
again.

696
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,910
JENNIFER: I saw what it was but--

697
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,360
LIAM: Well if you know what it was then keep it.

698
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,608
JENNIFER: I do know what--

699
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:43,865
LIAM: I can't read your die Jen! Yes, that's good,
that's 23. Okay.

700
00:48:43,865 --> 00:48:45,315
MATT: 23?

701
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:47,691
LIAM: Just remember that. Why can't I roll well?
Okay.

702
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,546
TRAVIS: What did you roll?

703
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:50,773
LIAM: 11.

704
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:55,792
MATT: All right so we have 23, we have-- how do
you spell your character's name again?

705
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:59,368
JENNIFER: A-E-R-W-Y-N but it's I-N, either one.

706
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:00,625
MATT: Aerwin? Okay cool.

707
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,340
LIAM: J-E-L-L-O.

708
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,175
MATT: There you go. Perfect.

709
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,940
TALIESIN: 14.

710
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,001
MATT: So it's 20 to 15? Anybody?

711
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:10,876
LAURA: Oh.

712
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:11,932
TRAVIS: She had 23 right?

713
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:13,033
MATT and JENNIFER: Yeah.

714
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,252
TRAVIS: Oh, what was it?

715
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,317
MATT: 20 to 15.

716
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:16,404
TRAVIS: I'm 15.

717
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:18,392
MATT: All righty. And spell your name for me real
fast.

718
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,053
TRAVIS: L-O-H-K-O-R.

719
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:21,645
LAURA: Lohkor.

720
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:29,124
MATT: 15 to ten.

721
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:30,787
TALIESIN: 14.

722
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:31,882
LAURA: 13.

723
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:33,476
LIAM: 11.

724
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:38,256
LAURA: Lies. 12.

725
00:49:38,256 --> 00:49:45,888
MATT: All righty and then--?

726
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:48,284
LIAM: 11. Quazirat.

727
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:49,645
TRAVIS: Quasimodo.

728
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:53,234
LIAM: Q-U-A-Z-I.

729
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:57,184
LAURA: I'm naming you Toes, because that's all I
can remember.

730
00:49:57,184 --> 00:50:01,228
MATT: All right, cool. So top of the round as all
the kobolds now notice you guys clustered right

731
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:07,418
there at the entrance of the cavern, start rushing
over the bridge, their pickaxes out and the larger

732
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:11,982
one on the opposite side, seeing this, seems to be
preparing for something. What are you doing?

733
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:13,883
JENNIFER: I'm loading up the crossbow.

734
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:17,091
MATT: Okay, so you pull out another bolt, load it
up and staying there, and you're going to fire at

735
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:18,385
which one?

736
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:20,933
JENNIFER: They're all behind the one in the
front?

737
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:25,754
MATT: There's the one that just kicked the guy you
killed and there's two sets that are running

738
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:27,795
across the bridges currently over the water.

739
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:29,432
JENNIFER: I'm going for their leader.

740
00:50:29,432 --> 00:50:32,553
MATT: Okay cool, so you might have to get a little
closer, you're about 40 feet away from him or you

741
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:35,153
can fire from now but you'll have disadvantage on
the attack. But up to you.

742
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:38,744
JENNIFER: I can move a little closer. I'll move,
hit and then move, right?

743
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,565
MATT: Okay.

744
00:50:39,565 --> 00:50:40,953
JENNIFER: I can do that can't I?

745
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:43,268
MATT: You can do that, yeah. So you go ahead and
move forward your 30 feet, that'll get you into

746
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:48,533
a 30 foot range. You'll be almost in melee range
with one of the kobolds. Go ahead and take a shot

747
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,171
at the leader.

748
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:53,362
JENNIFER: And that's these? No.

749
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:58,343
LIAM: To hit you roll d20. So roll the roundy and
add your attack bonus for crossbow.

750
00:50:58,343 --> 00:50:59,601
JENNIFER: 16.

751
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,509
MATT: 16 just hits. So you roll damage, it's not
sneak attack because you're not hidden.

752
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:06,068
LIAM: Yeah, so now you're just rolling d6, a cube.

753
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:10,540
JENNIFER: d6 cube. Which one's the d6? It's this
one! Okay, there we go.

754
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,268
LIAM: And add a five.

755
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:13,381
JENNIFER: Seven.

756
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:16,993
MATT: There we go, seven points of damage,
(grunting). They seem angry as it begins to reach

757
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:22,209
and fiddle with the back of his pack on his back.
You can use your bonus action to dash backward if

758
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,237
you'd like to back into the cavern entrance.

759
00:51:23,237 --> 00:51:25,968
JENNIFER: Yes, I think that's most useful.

760
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:29,510
MATT: Okay so, after firing the kobolds are
rushing in and you back up, getting behind your

761
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,076
allies to protect you. All right, that brings it
to Lohkor.

762
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:36,429
TRAVIS: I don't know why we always try and do this
stealthily. I get the warhammer out and I'll reach

763
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:39,328
forward to the one and take a big swing right in
his face.

764
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:42,677
MATT: Go for it. This is the one who kicked his
friend trying to wake him up.

765
00:51:42,677 --> 00:51:44,320
TRAVIS: 18.

766
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,375
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

767
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:51,708
TRAVIS: That's 1d8. 13 points of bludgeoning
damage.

768
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:55,002
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. All right.

769
00:51:55,002 --> 00:51:57,253
TRAVIS: I have another one because of extra
attack?

770
00:51:57,253 --> 00:51:58,501
MATT: You do.

771
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:01,441
TRAVIS: Nice! 15.

772
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:02,854
MATT: 15 hits.

773
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:06,099
TRAVIS: Nice. And that is seven points of
bludgeoning damage.

774
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:10,517
MATT: All right. As you rush forward the first hit
hits him upside the chin. You see a spatter of

775
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:15,711
blood across the rock behind you. He gets back and
pulls out his pickaxe, his angry whiskered face,

776
00:52:15,888 --> 00:52:20,006
you see fury in his eyes and you sink the hammer
into his face. He's like (cry of pain) (gurgle)

777
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:22,203
and he falls to the ground, dead.

778
00:52:22,203 --> 00:52:27,319
TRAVIS: Yes! I turn to the rest of them and I say:
Let them have it! And I take off running into the

779
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,594
fray.

780
00:52:28,594 --> 00:52:33,904
MATT: All right, great. As that's happening, you
running, the larger leader in the back who

781
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:41,336
finishes fiddling with his pack pulls a small rod,
holds it up to the top of the candle on his head

782
00:52:41,336 --> 00:52:50,978
and you watch it spark, and lobs it in an arc over
to where you are. The kobolds stop running and

783
00:52:50,978 --> 00:52:56,011
watch it going as it arcs over, except for two of
them that weren't paying attention and are

784
00:52:56,011 --> 00:53:01,729
charging towards you as it (thudding) between your
legs, rolls a little behind you, and there's that

785
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:08,387
brief moment where everything slows down for but
an instance before it explodes in a cacophonous

786
00:53:08,387 --> 00:53:13,021
explosion of flame and force. I need all of you to
make a dexterity saving throw.

787
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:15,398
JENNIFER: So that's the d20?

788
00:53:15,398 --> 00:53:24,716
LIAM: So yeah, roll d20. Dexterity save. So what
you get on that? Ten plus that is here. Nine.

789
00:53:24,716 --> 00:53:28,284
MATT: All right so, what did you get?

790
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:29,485
JENNIFER: 18.

791
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:30,611
MATT: Okay, that succeeds.

792
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:31,464
TALIESIN: Eight.

793
00:53:31,464 --> 00:53:32,304
MATT: Nope.

794
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:33,142
LAURA: 18.

795
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:34,082
MATT: Succeeds.

796
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,073
TRAVIS: 16.

797
00:53:35,073 --> 00:53:36,184
MATT: Just barely succeeds.

798
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:38,753
LIAM: And this is a save, not ability skill,
correct?

799
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:39,670
MATT: Right.

800
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,107
LIAM: Oh, that's big 11.

801
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:42,129
MATT: That's a failure.

802
00:53:42,129 --> 00:53:45,599
LIAM: No. I don't think so.

803
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,562
MATT: All right so, Bundle and Quazirat, you guys
both suffer 18 points of fire damage.

804
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:50,820
LIAM: Seems fake.

805
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:57,026
MATT: The rest of you suffer nine points of fire
damage. And the two nearest kobolds who are

806
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:02,969
rushing in to go after Lohkor also explode into
pieces and are thrown behind you. You see them

807
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:12,912
running like (screaming) (explosion) and are
destroyed by their own dynamite. And you hear this

808
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:19,559
laughter at the back of the cavern. "Firework!" He
seems to be rather excited and given this bit of

809
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:25,768
fury inspirational boost from the carnage he's
caused. All right, that's going to end his turn.

810
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:29,673
He's going to stay right there at the edge.
Bundle, your turn.

811
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:42,529
TALIESIN: Everything hurts, one second. I'm
finding a thing--

812
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:47,216
TRAVIS: New class abilities. We're all like,
flexing in the thing that we've never played

813
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:48,439
before.

814
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:49,941
TALIESIN: I know, this is so difficult.

815
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:51,512
JENNIFER: At least I'm not the only one.

816
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:59,853
TALIESIN: I'm going to quickly cast Mass Healing
Word on everybody while I, not even get up, I'm

817
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,396
going to sit up and cast Mass Healing Word on the
group.

818
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:05,862
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll that. That's a d4
plus your--

819
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:14,095
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right it's auto. So, d4 plus
wisdom modifier. That's six.

820
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:16,260
MATT: All right, so everyone heals six hit
points.

821
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:24,257
TALIESIN: And I'm going to use my bonus action to
create a Spiritual Weapon.

822
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:27,644
MATT: Okay. What kind of weapon is it taking the
form of?

823
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:37,079
TALIESIN: A giant hammer that looks a little bit
like an anvil that's bigger than his hammer. It's

824
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:44,499
going to manifest right above the main kobold's
head ten feet up.

825
00:55:44,499 --> 00:55:50,415
MATT: All right, so as it begins to apparate in
the sky, Lohkor, you look across and you can see

826
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,180
the hammer, slightly larger than your hammer,
apparate.

827
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,679
TRAVIS: Son of a Bundle!

828
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:59,604
MATT: It does take a swing at the leader, so go
for it. I believe when you summon, it gets to take

829
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:00,682
one hit.

830
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:01,979
TALIESIN: Does it get to take one hit?

831
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:03,395
MATT: Double-check.

832
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:04,666
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll go for it.

833
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,927
MATT: Spiritual Weapon. Yep!

834
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,937
TALIESIN: That's 15?

835
00:56:08,937 --> 00:56:14,413
MATT: 15 unfortunately misses. It swings, and you
can see the kobold look up as it sees your eyes

836
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:19,119
trace up and he goes, (growl). Sees it, (growl).
Leaps backward as it slams into the ground,

837
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,269
cracking the stone beneath and he dodges out of
the way. (laughs)

838
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:24,986
TRAVIS: Still with the performance issues, eh,
Bundle?

839
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:29,567
TALIESIN: I'm getting up! And I use my movement to
stand up and shake off.

840
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:33,336
MATT: All right, cool. Ending Bundle's turn,
that'll bring us to Grendlemine.

841
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:36,407
LAURA: Okay, it's Greldamine.

842
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:40,093
MATT: Greldamine, sorry! Reading my own
handwriting's a problem.

843
00:56:40,093 --> 00:56:46,376
LAURA: Are any of them in a line? Are they on the
bridge still?

844
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:49,584
MATT: On the bridge there's three on each bridge
that are in a line.

845
00:56:49,584 --> 00:56:51,821
LAURA: And then the big one?

846
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:57,192
MATT: Actually, no, at this point, there's two,
because two of them got blown away. There's two on

847
00:56:57,192 --> 00:56:58,548
each bridge right now.

848
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:02,861
LAURA: Okay, and the big one, is he lined up with
a bridge, or is he between the bridges?

849
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,319
MATT: No, he's in between the two.

850
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,425
LAURA: Okay.

851
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:06,505
LIAM: On other side.

852
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,030
JENNIFER: Is Greldamine still invisible?

853
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,374
MATT: She is currently.

854
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:12,993
LIAM: What's the length of those bridge,
guesstimation-wise?

855
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:16,962
MATT: The bridges are about 20 feet across, 15 to
20. They're not super long bridges; it's not a

856
00:57:16,962 --> 00:57:18,165
huge chamber.

857
00:57:18,165 --> 00:57:20,389
JENNIFER: How many of them are left now? We were
down to eight.

858
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:23,998
LIAM: Five total: two on each bridge, big guy
other side. Big is relative term.

859
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:31,861
LAURA: Okay. For fear of damaging the perhaps bag
of candles on the big one's back, that would be

860
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:48,092
bad, I'm going to cast Burning Hands towards one
of the bridges with two of the things on it.

861
00:57:48,092 --> 00:57:53,092
MATT: Okay! So you rush forward as two of the
surviving kobolds-- on the right or the left

862
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:53,933
bridge?

863
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,205
LAURA: The left!

864
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,693
MATT: Okay, so you run over to the left bridge
and, as the kobolds are rushing across with their

865
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:00,714
pickaxes out (heavy breathing), you--

866
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:02,285
LAURA: (screams)

867
00:58:02,285 --> 00:58:07,894
MATT: You watch as her invisible form suddenly
appears, apparating as the illusion that has been

868
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:14,076
hiding her vanishes. As a flamethrower gout of
fire burns out from in front, engulfing both of

869
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:20,226
the kobolds. What's the saving throw on that?
What's your DC? Your spell DC?

870
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:22,132
LAURA: My DC is 16.

871
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:28,789
MATT: 16! No! Yes! One of them succeeds, one of
them fails.

872
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:29,785
LAURA: Okay.

873
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:30,947
MATT: So, what's the damage on that?

874
00:58:30,947 --> 00:58:31,984
LAURA: 3d6 fire damage.

875
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:33,435
MATT: So go ahead and roll 3d6.

876
00:58:33,435 --> 00:58:34,967
LAURA: And it sets things on fire.

877
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:37,631
MATT: Yes. The bridge is definitely on fire.

878
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:41,147
LAURA: Nine damage.

879
00:58:41,147 --> 00:58:47,869
MATT: All right, nine damage. Then one of them
takes four damage. Okay, so they're like, "Ugh!"

880
00:58:47,869 --> 00:58:51,813
They pull back a bit, and you can see the edge of
their whiskers are curling in and burned. The

881
00:58:51,813 --> 00:58:55,902
fur's seared at the edges. Some of them actually
have caught fire and a little bit of smoke is

882
00:58:55,902 --> 00:58:58,891
pouring off. But the edge of the bridge that
they're standing on, that you're right in front

883
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:03,505
of, has definitely caught fire. And you can see
the two kobolds are now trying to figure out what

884
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:05,697
to do as they're stuck in the middle right now.

885
00:59:05,697 --> 00:59:10,548
LAURA: I'm going to run away from the bridge and
hide behind Lohkor's legs.

886
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:14,147
MATT: You used your movement to approach the
bridge to cast Burning Hands.

887
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:16,022
LAURA: Oh, I did? Great! Can I move at all?

888
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:17,536
MATT: I'll give you five feet.

889
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:18,672
LAURA: I'll back up five feet.

890
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:22,279
MATT: (small steps). Their eyes are trained on
<i>you.</i>

891
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:23,459
LAURA: Shit!

892
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,794
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. That brings
it to their turn. So, as far as kobolds go, the

893
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:30,509
two that are on the bridge start rushing towards
you. I'm going to go ahead and see if the bridge

894
00:59:30,509 --> 00:59:37,789
maintains its coherence for both of them. For the
first one it's fine. The second one it is not. So

895
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:44,193
the first kobold runs forward and it's going to
swing at you with its pickaxe. Because you were

896
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:47,760
damaged by another kobold, it gets a bonus to
damage.

897
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,334
LAURA: I was? Oh, I was.

898
00:59:49,334 --> 00:59:54,046
MATT: From the explosion earlier. So, that is
going to be a 20 to hit?

899
00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:55,081
LAURA: Oh.

900
00:59:55,081 --> 00:59:56,573
MATT: I believe that hits, right?

901
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:57,972
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

902
00:59:57,972 --> 01:00:02,582
MATT: All right, and you suffer ten points of
piercing damage as the pickaxe hacks into your

903
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:08,027
shoulder as it rushes past. The other one, as it's
running towards you, you see it pulling back its

904
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:13,487
pickaxe to follow through and try and attack with
its friend as the final ropes release. And you

905
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:19,289
watch him go (yells) and vanish into the water
below. You hear him (gurgles) as he gets carried

906
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:23,360
by the water current further down the river and
he's trying to swim upstream. He's currently stuck

907
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,282
in the middle of trying to figure out what to do
there. The other two rush across the other side of

908
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:34,238
the chamber, finish traversing that bridge, and go
straight towards you, Lohkor, because you're the

909
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:40,263
closest to them at this point. That's going to be
a 17 to hit.

910
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:41,322
TRAVIS: Misses.

911
01:00:41,322 --> 01:00:46,713
MATT: You reach out and you parry off to the side.
The other one's going to go ahead and instead he's

912
01:00:46,713 --> 01:00:50,823
going to-- That's a 22 to hit.

913
01:00:50,823 --> 01:00:51,829
TRAVIS: That does hit.

914
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:58,875
MATT: So you go ahead and suffer six points of
piercing damage. The first one you deflect, the

915
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,307
second one hits you, jamming into one of the
plates, bending the armor, and hitting you in the

916
01:01:02,307 --> 01:01:06,172
side. You feel your body tense from the severe
pain. But it's nothing, you've had worse.

917
01:01:06,172 --> 01:01:08,228
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just not the face.

918
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:12,735
MATT: Quazirat, you're up.

919
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:18,424
LIAM: Is there a clear path between where I'm
standing and either bridge?

920
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:24,137
MATT: Well, one bridge is currently collapsed. The
one on the right you could run through, but you

921
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:29,743
would probably be getting attacked from both the
kobolds that ran across and are blocking the path.

922
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:32,288
You'd have to take an attack of opportunity from
both of them.

923
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:37,985
LIAM: Yeah, that sounds fun. I'm going to run for
edge of bridge on this side. How far is that for

924
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,257
me where I'm starting?

925
01:01:39,257 --> 01:01:42,289
MATT: I'd say it's about 15 feet from you now.

926
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:44,801
LIAM: That's good. I like it. 15 feet is good. I
run towards edge.

927
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:50,488
MATT: Okay, so you run to the edge. You go past
the two kobolds. Are you just running past them?

928
01:01:50,488 --> 01:01:51,715
LIAM: Yes.

929
01:01:51,715 --> 01:01:55,728
MATT: All right, they both get attacks of
opportunity on you. The first one is-- Wow, the

930
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:59,968
golden snitch is working for me now. That is 21 to
hit.

931
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:01,742
LIAM: Sure, that hits.

932
01:02:01,742 --> 01:02:07,016
MATT: That is seven points of piercing damage as
the pickaxe swings and snags you in the back of

933
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:11,129
the shoulder blade. The other one is a 17 to hit.

934
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:12,529
LIAM: No, eat shit.

935
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:17,620
MATT: That one scrapes across the back of your
armor and makes no effective impact. You continue

936
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,238
rushing across the bridge--

937
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:24,602
LIAM: No. I used 15 feet to get here. I'm going to
do my running long jump for 25 feet over 20 foot bridge

938
01:02:24,602 --> 01:02:30,461
you describe to me and land on other side. And
move up to this asshole on other side.

939
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:40,746
MATT: Okay. You cannot jump further than your
movement speed, technically. So you run, you jump,

940
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:46,630
and you're getting right towards the edge there. I
would like you to go ahead and make an acrobatics

941
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,354
check.

942
01:02:47,354 --> 01:02:50,777
LIAM: Oh, you think I would understand this
mechanic before this moment in my life at level

943
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:52,525
seven. What kind of check?

944
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:53,997
MATT: This would be an acrobatics check.

945
01:02:53,997 --> 01:03:08,719
LIAM: Okay. Oh, not great at all. But I get to add
two because of Remarkable Athlete, so hopefully

946
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,238
that's enough. 14.

947
01:03:11,238 --> 01:03:18,743
MATT: 14. You were prepared. You make your way
through the air, barely catch the edge of where

948
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:23,569
the other platform begins, and you roll over the
shoulder into it. And as you come to stand, you're

949
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:28,267
right there before the leader kobold who's there
with his giant pack there ready as he has another

950
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:31,798
one of these sticks that he's currently trying to
pull up to the candle on his head. What are you

951
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:32,676
going to do?

952
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:37,476
LIAM: I'm how far from him?

953
01:03:37,476 --> 01:03:38,701
MATT: You're right up against him.

954
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:47,217
LIAM: Oh, well I'm going to take his head off. I
had a pet rat but I don't care. Here we go. Oh,

955
01:03:47,217 --> 01:04:00,705
that's a one! But I have an extra attack, so I
will go again. Oh, that's so bad! That's a 12.

956
01:04:00,705 --> 01:04:08,066
MATT: As you confidently grin, your massive
draenei body looking down upon this kobold, who

957
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:13,547
looks like he got caught with his hand in the
cookie jar, you swing wide with-- What weapon are

958
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:14,842
you using?

959
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:15,895
LIAM: I'm using greatsword.

960
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:20,477
MATT: This giant two-handed cleaver that swings,
and the kobold goes (hums).

961
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:24,057
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to embarrass myself
further and use action surge.

962
01:04:24,057 --> 01:04:28,132
MATT: Okay, make two more attacks. He dodges both
of your swings.

963
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:31,040
LIAM: Colville, don't fuck me, Colville!

964
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,337
MATT: It's now laughing.

965
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:36,304
LIAM: 15 for the one.

966
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:38,168
MATT: 15 just misses.

967
01:04:38,168 --> 01:04:40,808
LIAM: But this last one is okay! 17.

968
01:04:40,808 --> 01:04:42,102
MATT: 17 does hit.

969
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:43,173
LIAM: Yes, finally!

970
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:46,185
MATT: He dodges the third one and goes, "You have
problem? Can't hit?"

971
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:57,126
LIAM: Oh Fievel, your troubles are just beginning.
That is ten slashing damage.

972
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:03,472
MATT: Ten slashing damage. You take a chunk out of
his shoulder. "This favorite shoulder!"

973
01:05:03,472 --> 01:05:09,130
LIAM: Kiss my sword. The hilt says Leeron Jenkins.
Let's get this shit started!

974
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:17,526
MATT: Perfect. Ending your turn. To the top. It is
your turn, Aerwin. So there are now currently four

975
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:25,216
living kobolds. Well, one of them has fallen into
the river, who is currently beneath the water,

976
01:05:25,216 --> 01:05:29,030
struggling against the current. There is one that
is partially damaged that is currently up against

977
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:32,568
and fighting him. Actually, no, two of them that
are up against fighting you and one that's up

978
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:33,736
against you.

979
01:05:33,736 --> 01:05:36,559
JENNIFER: But this one also--

980
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,558
MATT: Yes, there's the main leader across the way
that he's currently up against.

981
01:05:39,558 --> 01:05:44,574
LIAM: So, you attack this guy, you get sneak
attack damage because I am right up against him.

982
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,201
JENNIFER: Yes, I want to do that.

983
01:05:46,201 --> 01:05:47,809
MATT: All right, so you're taking another shot
with your crossbow?

984
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:48,853
JENNIFER: Yes.

985
01:05:48,853 --> 01:05:54,776
MATT: All right, so you load up another bolt. And
then aiming across the way. Making your way up

986
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:59,227
close to where the bridge is, you'll end up being
in the melee range of the one that's fighting her,

987
01:05:59,227 --> 01:06:00,671
but you can still make the strike.

988
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:02,447
LIAM: Acceptable risk.

989
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:05,751
JENNIFER: All right, so I roll a d20?

990
01:06:05,751 --> 01:06:07,455
MATT: Go ahead and roll your attack.

991
01:06:07,455 --> 01:06:10,474
LIAM: What'd you get? Plus your crossbow--

992
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:12,998
JENNIFER: 19.

993
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:15,196
MATT: 19 hits, go ahead and roll damage plus sneak
attack damage.

994
01:06:15,196 --> 01:06:21,439
LIAM: So, 1d6 to start, then you add the other
cubes. Okay, that's good.

995
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:27,588
JENNIFER: And then I add these guys? Okay. 18.

996
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:28,823
LIAM: Plus?

997
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:29,849
JENNIFER: 23.

998
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:37,167
MATT: As the kobold's still laughing after the
blows of your warrior friend swinging wide, It's

999
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:43,929
like, "It's fun, I take you with me! It's--" You
watch as a crossbow bolt slinks right into where

1000
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:50,678
the top of the clavicle in the kobold's neck is.
It's reaching up to try and pull it out. Its

1001
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:56,659
fingers look like it's going numb and it looks
hurt. It's holding on but it's hurt. That's a

1002
01:06:56,659 --> 01:07:00,109
nice, slick shot. So, you've made your movement.
You have a bonus action if you wanted to do

1003
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:01,098
anything.

1004
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:05,046
JENNIFER: Well, I'm right next to the one that's
attacking her, correct? I think I'll turn around

1005
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:06,263
with the short sword--

1006
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:12,856
LIAM: Nope, you cannot do that with bonus. But is
she up against any kobolds at the moment?

1007
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:14,979
MATT: She's right next to one that's been fighting
her.

1008
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:20,766
LIAM: Well, the best you could do with a bonus is
maybe to disengage. Which means get away from them

1009
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:24,297
so they cannot hurt you. But you cannot hit again
with--

1010
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,264
JENNIFER: Okay, I'll disengage.

1011
01:07:26,264 --> 01:07:29,403
LAURA: Yeah, leave me alone next to it, thank you.
Thank you for the good advice.

1012
01:07:29,403 --> 01:07:31,650
LIAM: That's good advice. Just dance back a little
bit.

1013
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,494
MATT: So with the five feet of your movement left,
you go ahead and step away, using your bonus

1014
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:39,739
action to disengage, carefully stepping from the
kobold as it's going feral right now, feeling

1015
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:41,968
surrounded. That ends your turn. You're up,
Lohkor.

1016
01:07:41,968 --> 01:07:50,174
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am <i>over</i> these guys right next to
me. Warhammer! That is a 22.

1017
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:52,693
MATT: 22 will definitely hit.

1018
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,926
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

1019
01:07:56,926 --> 01:08:00,448
MATT: 12 points of bludgeoning damage. As it comes
down, the hammer slams into the chest area of one

1020
01:08:00,448 --> 01:08:06,370
of the kobolds that's harassing you. It hits him
and you hear this little squeak sound as the chest

1021
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:11,379
cavity takes a very heavy blow. Still standing,
but it's hurt.

1022
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:17,350
TRAVIS: Still standing, eh? Round two! That is a
25.

1023
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,874
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

1024
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:22,733
TRAVIS: Another 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

1025
01:08:22,733 --> 01:08:27,079
MATT: And with that you use the momentum of
pulling away to swing upward and from the

1026
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:31,841
underhand to hit. It snaps against the bottom of
the kobold's jaw and you hear its neck (cracks)

1027
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:37,979
from the impact and it falls onto its back as its
legs curl back into its torso. And it's done.

1028
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:42,508
TRAVIS: With my bonus action I turn and point to
the last standing one: My eye sees you.

1029
01:08:42,508 --> 01:08:50,693
MATT: You swear you see a slight tinkle dribble
down its leg. All right, that ends your turn. At

1030
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:59,351
this point, the leader over there who's glaring at
you goes, "No, Ham has to finish his work!" And

1031
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:05,679
he's going to go ahead and grab one of the-- Yeah,
it regenerates. Rolled a five. He pulls another

1032
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,373
what you recognize now to be sticks of dynamite.
And looking at his pack you can see his pack is

1033
01:09:09,373 --> 01:09:16,579
filled. It wasn't candles in that pack. It is
jam-filled with explosives. And he goes rushing

1034
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:18,712
past you. You get an attack of opportunity on him.

1035
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:24,278
LIAM: Oh good, yes. He's got lots of candles!
Yeah, that's good. That's 24.

1036
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:25,343
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

1037
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:27,187
LAURA: Chop his head off!

1038
01:09:27,187 --> 01:09:31,572
LIAM: I'm trying! It's a ten.

1039
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:38,393
MATT: Ten points of damage. (yells) Takes a heavy
hit but continues rushing past the bridge area.

1040
01:09:38,393 --> 01:09:44,767
Then, as he's rushing, he lights it from the top
of his head and chucks it in your guys' direction.

1041
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:58,274
As it lands, it detonates, taking out-- let's see
here. Damage-wise, everybody but you needs to go

1042
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,857
ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw please.

1043
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:03,351
LAURA: Oh no, this is bad.

1044
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:08,870
LIAM: Okay, so you did quite good with 22, yeah.

1045
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,684
TRAVIS: That's a one.

1046
01:10:10,684 --> 01:10:12,298
MATT: 21 points of fire damage.

1047
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:13,612
LAURA: 15.

1048
01:10:13,612 --> 01:10:18,220
MATT: 15 just barely succeeds, so you take 12
points of fire damage.

1049
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,716
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

1050
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:26,688
MATT: I said 21, right? Sorry, so it's ten points
of fire damage. 21 points of fire damage.

1051
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:28,509
JENNIFER: 22.

1052
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:30,355
MATT: Ten points of fire damage.

1053
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,801
LIAM: Does she have evasion?

1054
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:33,405
MATT: You do, so you take nothing.

1055
01:10:33,405 --> 01:10:36,247
LIAM: Zero! Because rogue is best class.

1056
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:43,584
MATT: So you, seeing this coming, you jump
backwards, grab the kobold that's in front, and

1057
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:49,184
use him to shield you from the blast. And he goes
(screams) and scatters into ash as it manages to

1058
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:55,060
detonate and explode the remaining kobolds in the
area. So all the kobolds that were with him have

1059
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,508
all fallen to the ground now, turned to ash, or
detonated in some way. And you can see as the

1060
01:11:00,508 --> 01:11:10,227
leader of them is catching his breath across the
bridge, he goes, "Oh no." And he glances past with

1061
01:11:10,227 --> 01:11:13,832
his long gaze, and you can look over at the other
kobolds that had their own small caches of

1062
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:18,268
dynamite sticks, some of which have been lit by
the recent explosion, that are rolling towards the

1063
01:11:18,268 --> 01:11:20,182
rock wall where you guys entered.

1064
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:24,634
TRAVIS: We've got to go! Double dash, all the way
out!

1065
01:11:24,634 --> 01:11:30,341
MATT: So you guys all start rushing towards where?
Off the bridge?

1066
01:11:30,341 --> 01:11:32,365
LAURA: Across the bridge, right?

1067
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:39,353
MATT: All right. So, I need all of you guys to--
Let's have everyone roll an initiative check right

1068
01:11:39,353 --> 01:11:43,516
now since technically the combat here is finished.
We're going to do this as to see who can manage to

1069
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:45,185
make it across before the explosion.

1070
01:11:45,185 --> 01:11:46,786
TRAVIS: It's going to be an early night.

1071
01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:48,837
TALIESIN: What's the check again?

1072
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:53,787
MATT: Just roll initiative.

1073
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:55,183
LAURA: 19.

1074
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:56,375
TRAVIS: Four.

1075
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:59,464
TALIESIN: God, why am I rolling so bad? Ten.

1076
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:01,789
JENNIFER: 16.

1077
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:02,810
LIAM: 14.

1078
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:08,050
MATT: Okay. You were pretty much mostly fine
across the bridge. All of you go rushing past as

1079
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:15,365
you see Lohkor going (huffing and explosion). You
see the whole room behind him light up. You can

1080
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:23,637
see a silhouette. It's full-on movie style
explosion as you see it burn past him. You only

1081
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:28,890
catch the edge of it, which is good, because you
then only suffer eight points of fire damage. But

1082
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:35,096
you watch as the entrance you guys came through
falls and collapses, a series of boulders and

1083
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:39,121
rocks, the opposite end of the chamber falling in
on itself. Part of the river, you can see the

1084
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:44,565
kobold that's barely clawing its way out of the
water, (panting) "Huh?" (thud). A rock hits and

1085
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:51,264
smashes him across the bank. Part of the river
fills in and you can see now the bank splashing

1086
01:12:51,264 --> 01:12:54,309
over and starting to try to make its way back. But
you guys are now on the opposite side of the

1087
01:12:54,309 --> 01:12:58,995
chamber. It's quiet. You all take a minute to
breathe, look at your wounds. You're a bit singed

1088
01:12:58,995 --> 01:13:00,048
around the way--

1089
01:13:00,048 --> 01:13:04,648
TRAVIS: I'm putting out the fire in my hair. I use
Lay on Hands to put out the fire.

1090
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:08,619
LAURA: Oh, I forgot to do this. And I cast Mage
Armor on myself.

1091
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:12,974
TRAVIS: Before. Much better than after.

1092
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:16,331
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe do a Prayer of
Healing. Also, technically speaking, I have

1093
01:13:16,331 --> 01:13:20,588
Disciple of Light, which means-- Would everyone
have gained an extra five points?

1094
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:24,864
MATT: They would've, yes. Keep that in mind. Next
time. We'll say for now, you guys all would've

1095
01:13:24,864 --> 01:13:28,682
healed an additional five points of damage because
he is really good at healing as a priest.

1096
01:13:28,682 --> 01:13:35,787
LIAM: You want to take like five, or maybe even 20
minutes here before we go forward?

1097
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,199
TRAVIS: I mean we're hot on the trail.

1098
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,808
LAURA: Why do we need to do that?

1099
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:43,885
LIAM: I don't know. You know, conserving energy,
that kind of thing. Let's go! You want to kick

1100
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:46,231
ass, I can tell. Little one, let's go.

1101
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:53,573
JENNIFER: I'm with her. I will now call her Small
and Brave. I'm with Small and Brave. SB for short.

1102
01:13:53,573 --> 01:14:00,471
TALIESIN: I can't do Prayer of Healing while we're
walking though, can I? It's just verbal.

1103
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:04,271
MATT: Is it the ten minute one? You have to sit
still for ten minutes to do it.

1104
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:15,582
TALIESIN: Ten minutes to heal everybody up a bit.
So that's 2d8 plus my spellcasting ability

1105
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:17,034
modifier?

1106
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:19,491
TRAVIS: That's not long enough for hit dice and
stuff though?

1107
01:14:19,491 --> 01:14:21,458
MATT: So roll 2d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

1108
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:22,694
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

1109
01:14:22,694 --> 01:14:24,611
MATT: Double ones?

1110
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:25,711
TALIESIN: Yep.

1111
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:31,170
TRAVIS: You gave the golden snitch away, Taliesin.
This is the beginning of the end.

1112
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,206
LAURA: Did he really?

1113
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:33,725
LIAM: He tossed it at the DM.

1114
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:39,236
TALIESIN: So that's nine points of healing to
everybody.

1115
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,463
MATT: Still good. All of you guys heal nine
points. That's not bad.

1116
01:14:41,463 --> 01:14:48,057
JENNIFER: Okay, so we already added the five, but
we don't get the five?

1117
01:14:48,057 --> 01:14:51,158
MATT: Nine on top of that.

1118
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:53,266
JENNIFER: Nine more on top of the five? Okay.

1119
01:14:53,266 --> 01:15:01,028
MATT: As Bundle finishes the Prayer of Healing and
you all feel your wounds begin to close and stitch

1120
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:04,988
themselves together, you see a little bit of
movement at the edge of the banks. Between the

1121
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:12,903
rock that had plummeted into it, you watch as a
tiny hand-- Climbing out of the water you see a

1122
01:15:12,903 --> 01:15:16,730
very bloodied, smashed, one eye swollen kobold.

1123
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:20,009
LAURA: Can I use Firebolt at it?

1124
01:15:20,009 --> 01:15:25,391
TRAVIS: No! Don't you want to ask maybe what they
were doing down here, or what their plans might

1125
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:26,490
be?

1126
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,733
LAURA: Oh, I mean sure, if that sounds good to
you!

1127
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,576
TRAVIS: I think it might be wise.

1128
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:32,771
LAURA: I'm a rage monster. I just like to kill
things!

1129
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:34,319
TRAVIS: I know that about you.

1130
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:36,260
JENNIFER: That's why she's my new best friend.

1131
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,727
LAURA: Go for it.

1132
01:15:37,727 --> 01:15:42,420
TRAVIS: Can I go over and pick it up by the back
of the neck?

1133
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,661
MATT: (squeals)

1134
01:15:43,661 --> 01:15:48,168
TRAVIS: Hello, friend. Before I let one of these
fine people--

1135
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:52,266
MATT: As he's scrambling right now, looking up at
the candle which is currently out because of the

1136
01:15:52,266 --> 01:15:55,674
waterlogged, it's like (whimpers).

1137
01:15:55,674 --> 01:16:02,741
TRAVIS: I know, a very sad face. Before one of
these fine people sends you to your maker, what

1138
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:04,031
were you doing in here?

1139
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:10,378
MATT: "Okay. Just, you friend, right? I work,
help!"

1140
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:14,266
TRAVIS: Yes, friend. Much more work for you,
friend.

1141
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:15,661
MATT: "Reeksus."

1142
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:17,498
TRAVIS: Wicksis.

1143
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:19,073
MATT: "Reeksus."

1144
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:20,325
TRAVIS: Reeksus.

1145
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,633
LAURA: You understand what he's saying? Because I
can't tell at all.

1146
01:16:23,633 --> 01:16:36,200
MATT: "We sent by great King Togwaggle. Togwaggle
send us to make bigger booms! Make better tunnels

1147
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,207
"to people town!"

1148
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:42,352
TRAVIS: Yes, I am aware of people town.

1149
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:46,437
MATT: "King Togwaggle greatest, best of all
kobolds!"

1150
01:16:46,437 --> 01:16:52,101
LIAM: How are those tunnels coming? You've made
them, or making them?

1151
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:59,009
MATT: "We made and make more, by the glory of
Rakanishu and King Togwaggle."

1152
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:02,708
TRAVIS: King Togwaggle, is he here with you now,
close by?

1153
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:06,421
MATT: He looks back towards the closed door.

1154
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,677
TRAVIS: Back that way?

1155
01:17:09,677 --> 01:17:12,612
LAURA: Does the king have all of our candles?

1156
01:17:12,612 --> 01:17:14,159
MATT: "Lots of candles."

1157
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,179
LAURA: Lots of candles. We should talk to him.

1158
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:20,020
JENNIFER: How many people are with the king?

1159
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,876
MATT: "People? No people."

1160
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:28,020
JENNIFER: Sorry, how many of your kind are with
the king?

1161
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,959
MATT: "King is not very kind either, but is good
king!"

1162
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:35,331
JENNIFER: Are there many kobolds with the king?

1163
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:36,871
MATT: "There is a few."

1164
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:40,047
JENNIFER: More than there were here?

1165
01:17:40,047 --> 01:17:43,064
MATT: "Depends on the time of day."

1166
01:17:43,064 --> 01:17:45,216
LAURA: What about now?

1167
01:17:45,216 --> 01:17:47,507
MATT: "I don't know, we've been away for a
while."

1168
01:17:47,507 --> 01:17:55,520
JENNIFER: When do you eat? When do the kobold
eat?

1169
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,302
MATT: "When there is food."

1170
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:59,227
LAURA: I like him. Can we keep him?

1171
01:17:59,227 --> 01:18:01,726
TRAVIS: And what would we do with him?

1172
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:03,135
MATT: "Do you have food to eat?"

1173
01:18:03,135 --> 01:18:08,304
JENNIFER: Do all the kobold eat together?

1174
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:10,536
LAURA: I pull out some beef jerky and hand it to
him.

1175
01:18:10,536 --> 01:18:11,915
MATT: (messy chewing)

1176
01:18:11,915 --> 01:18:22,773
JENNIFER: There's more where that came from if you
answer the question. Are there more than those of

1177
01:18:22,773 --> 01:18:26,242
us you see here of the kobold?

1178
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:33,045
MATT: "There are, but scattered. Dangerous
tunnels, find dangerous things. Wander. Avoid

1179
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,674
"them! We do."

1180
01:18:34,674 --> 01:18:40,877
TRAVIS: Quazi, do you think maybe you could
convince him to show us safe passage?

1181
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:46,809
LIAM: Safe passage, convince him? Oh, yes. Bring
closer.

1182
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:50,296
MATT: (squeals) And you catch him as he throws
him.

1183
01:18:50,296 --> 01:18:54,793
LIAM: Your hands, what I like about them is
they're so little (bones snapping).

1184
01:18:54,793 --> 01:19:00,731
MATT: (yelps) Make an intimidation check. With
advantage for breaking his hands.

1185
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:08,153
LIAM: That's a 17.

1186
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:11,449
MATT: (screams and sobs)

1187
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:14,942
LIAM: Okay, I can do this to you five more times.

1188
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:16,761
MATT: "No, I only have two hands!"

1189
01:19:16,761 --> 01:19:28,123
LIAM: I can play this game all night long, little
man. So we need to get inside. We need to be, you

1190
01:19:28,123 --> 01:19:34,413
know, alive and not getting killed, so we would
like to keep you. She has lots of beef jerky, we

1191
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:38,087
could feed you. But we can't have any, what did
you call these?

1192
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:44,536
MATT: "Boom booms. Okay, I show you. I show you!
Don't break! No more arms left to break."

1193
01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:47,510
LAURA: Aw, heal him, please? His poor hands!

1194
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:53,155
LIAM: Well let him earn it first, you know? Maybe,
20 minutes we're still alive, you have healed hand

1195
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,490
and more meat.

1196
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,941
MATT: "Okay. Put me down?"

1197
01:19:56,941 --> 01:19:58,418
LIAM: I'm not holding you.

1198
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,585
TRAVIS: Yes, you are.

1199
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:05,509
LIAM: You gave him to me? I like this guy. Pat pat
pat.

1200
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:10,246
MATT: In the rush of combat, you didn't realize
that you were clutching him the whole time.

1201
01:20:10,246 --> 01:20:15,191
LIAM: Well, I went like this. I thought you were
holding him. You know, Dungeons & Dragons is funny

1202
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:22,270
thing. Your mind's different from my mind. Who
knows what we're seeing? I drop his ass on

1203
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,457
ground.

1204
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,717
MATT: "We need to go through door."

1205
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:28,193
JENNIFER: Should we secure him?

1206
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:30,207
LAURA: If you want.

1207
01:20:30,207 --> 01:20:31,299
TALIESIN: We've got rope.

1208
01:20:31,299 --> 01:20:36,745
TRAVIS: Just so we make sure you don't break your
other hand, she's going to make sure that you're

1209
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:38,284
secure.

1210
01:20:38,284 --> 01:20:40,264
MATT: "Okay."

1211
01:20:40,264 --> 01:20:42,501
JENNIFER: Do I need to roll something for that?

1212
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:45,759
MATT: No, easy enough. He waits for you-- You have
rope on you?

1213
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:47,004
JENNIFER: I do, I have rope.

1214
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:49,881
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and you bind him up
and you have a little leash that you're holding

1215
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:52,518
him by. And he's like, "Okay. To the door."

1216
01:20:52,518 --> 01:20:55,473
JENNIFER: Can I pass her the leash since he's her
pet?

1217
01:20:55,473 --> 01:21:02,574
MATT: "Oh. Pet?" Greldamine.

1218
01:21:02,574 --> 01:21:03,926
LAURA: What?

1219
01:21:03,926 --> 01:21:06,565
MATT: You're having a kobold's leash handed to
you.

1220
01:21:06,565 --> 01:21:08,510
JENNIFER: Can I pass him your leash? Would you
like to have him as a pet?

1221
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,760
LAURA: Oh, well, all right.

1222
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,665
MATT: Broken, jagged teeth, spittle drooling
down.

1223
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:19,133
LAURA: I don't think he's much of a pet. He's more
of a companion.

1224
01:21:19,133 --> 01:21:22,183
MATT: "Could you light the candle?"

1225
01:21:22,183 --> 01:21:24,280
LAURA: I will in a little bit.

1226
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,754
MATT: (whines)

1227
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:29,283
JENNIFER: Hearts next to it.

1228
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:31,196
LAURA: What's your name?

1229
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:33,451
MATT: "Reeksus."

1230
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:36,083
LAURA: Reeksus. You got it.

1231
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:40,260
MATT: "Open door!"

1232
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,520
TRAVIS: Through the door then.

1233
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,493
LIAM: And I kick him really hard in the ass. Lead
the way.

1234
01:21:46,493 --> 01:21:49,211
MATT: The door is closed.

1235
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:50,278
LIAM: Lead the way.

1236
01:21:50,278 --> 01:21:52,642
MATT: "I'm bound! You made me put rope on it!"

1237
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:54,977
TRAVIS: Is there a latch, a door knob?

1238
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:58,396
MATT: There is a handle latch and it looks like
there is a lock mechanism to it.

1239
01:21:58,396 --> 01:22:00,780
TRAVIS: Hmm, a lock.

1240
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,430
JENNIFER: Whose purview is this?

1241
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,618
LIAM: That's you. You take look. Make sure it does
not explode on you.

1242
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:08,786
JENNIFER: I don't see any wicks. I don't see
anything explosive.

1243
01:22:08,786 --> 01:22:12,054
MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to
check for traps.

1244
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:19,123
JENNIFER: Oh! 25.

1245
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:22,339
TALIESIN: What did you roll? Well, she rolled a
20.

1246
01:22:22,339 --> 01:22:25,404
LAURA: That's important.

1247
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:30,708
MATT: Very nice. It's a lock mechanism. A
relatively simple lock. It is not trapped. So, you

1248
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:34,551
could easily undo this with your thieves' tools.

1249
01:22:34,551 --> 01:22:37,126
JENNIFER: So I do something so I can do that?

1250
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:41,841
MATT: Yep, so you roll another d20, and then add
your proficiency modifier and your dexterity

1251
01:22:41,841 --> 01:22:43,154
modifier.

1252
01:22:43,154 --> 01:22:46,845
LIAM: This plus this, so plus eight to what you
roll.

1253
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:49,002
JENNIFER: So that is 14.

1254
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:57,576
MATT: Easy enough. The door unlocks, opens a bit,
and beyond that is a tunnel of darkness. An

1255
01:22:57,576 --> 01:23:01,708
interesting smell hits you as you open it though.
Whereas inside here you have that damp,

1256
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:06,781
hard-water, Pirates of the Caribbean ride smell
that's in the water chamber, beyond that as the

1257
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:16,752
door opens this musty, almost mildewed smell hits
you. It's earthy, it's fresh, it's natural, but

1258
01:23:16,752 --> 01:23:20,544
it's definitely an underground, familiar smell.

1259
01:23:20,544 --> 01:23:23,729
JENNIFER: Why can we never encounter a field of
flowers?

1260
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:29,993
LAURA: Should I light up a rock again?

1261
01:23:29,993 --> 01:23:37,594
TALIESIN: Oh, I can do it. So I pick up a rock and
light it up, and toss it in front of us. Just keep

1262
01:23:37,594 --> 01:23:40,637
kicking it down.

1263
01:23:40,637 --> 01:23:44,885
MATT: It lights up the chamber as it goes, and you
continue to walk and kick it as you push forward.

1264
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:52,894
The walls begin to slowly glow the further in you
go. You begin to notice that, aside from a few

1265
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:57,939
small crystalline areas, there are heavy bits of
fungus that are beginning to appear along these

1266
01:23:57,939 --> 01:24:04,011
chambers. Glowing green, orange, blue mushrooms
and clusters of fungal matter that are beginning

1267
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:09,084
to give this faint luminescence to the interior of
the chamber. And you now very much understand

1268
01:24:09,084 --> 01:24:17,020
where the smell was coming from. As you begin to
curve around the right side of it, the tunnel

1269
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:22,400
widens a little broader to about 15 feet wide. The
mushrooms begin to get larger and larger, some of

1270
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,423
them four feet tall or bigger. You can see large
pillar stalactites and stalagmites are meeting in

1271
01:24:27,423 --> 01:24:31,043
the center where they give their own little
offshoots of fungus. But some of these are getting

1272
01:24:31,043 --> 01:24:37,377
very big and the pathways are getting a little
narrow to move past until, as you turn around one

1273
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:42,508
of the right bends, the fungus is pushed around to
the point where it's a very narrow passage to push

1274
01:24:42,508 --> 01:24:44,241
through these fungal forests.

1275
01:24:44,241 --> 01:24:46,611
LIAM: I don't like mushrooms.

1276
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:48,601
LAURA: They're quite tasty, actually.

1277
01:24:48,601 --> 01:24:51,629
TALIESIN: Could make a glowing salad of some
kind.

1278
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:53,470
LAURA: Ooh, yeah. Hey, Reeksus.

1279
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:55,419
MATT: "Yeah?"

1280
01:24:55,419 --> 01:25:00,642
LAURA: I give him a little bit of beef jerky.
Okay. Do you want to go in front of us and lead

1281
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,468
the way to your king?

1282
01:25:02,468 --> 01:25:12,756
MATT: "Okay." And he carefully turns to his side
and thins up and slowly-- with disadvantage

1283
01:25:12,756 --> 01:25:19,213
because he's bound-- still effectively manages to
squiggle his way between the small path. And you

1284
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:25,477
can see he knows it pretty well, through the small
cluster of dense tall fungus safely to the other

1285
01:25:25,477 --> 01:25:26,698
side.

1286
01:25:26,698 --> 01:25:28,275
LAURA: Is it bad to touch it?

1287
01:25:28,275 --> 01:25:30,511
MATT: "I would not recommend it."

1288
01:25:30,511 --> 01:25:35,720
LIAM: And the rope is still trailing from him?

1289
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,137
MATT: Yeah, it's 30 feet of slack rope. It's on
the ground over there.

1290
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:41,696
TRAVIS: If only we had some fire.

1291
01:25:41,696 --> 01:25:51,790
LAURA: Oh. Do you want me to set these on fire?
Because I have some. I mean, is it safe to burn?

1292
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:59,418
What if it sets off a poison when they're on fire?
I've heard that burning mushrooms could get you,

1293
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:01,949
you know--

1294
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,830
TRAVIS: <i>Eating</i> mushrooms.

1295
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,236
LAURA: Oh, it's not fumes?

1296
01:26:05,236 --> 01:26:06,734
TALIESIN, LIAM and TRAVIS: No.

1297
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:16,388
LAURA: Oh! I wouldn't know. They don't allow that
kind of stuff at mage school. Okay! I'm going to

1298
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:20,866
go through! Wait, am I going to burn it? I'm going
to get to the other side and then I'm going to try

1299
01:26:20,866 --> 01:26:26,720
to burn it. I don't want to burn Reeks. Okay. I go
to the other side.

1300
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,683
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a straight dexterity
check, please.

1301
01:26:30,683 --> 01:26:41,949
LAURA: All right. Woo-hoo! What is that, 18 or 19?
18 plus dexterity. 21.

1302
01:26:41,949 --> 01:26:45,992
MATT: Following suit, you deftly follow the same
pattern and come out the other side, not even

1303
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:54,902
touching any of the fungus with either side of your
armored shoulder pauldrons. Your mantle, I guess

1304
01:26:54,902 --> 01:26:56,292
it would be.

1305
01:26:56,292 --> 01:27:00,013
LAURA: Should I try to burn them now? What do you
guys think?

1306
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:04,705
LIAM: Depends on what we think biggest threat is.
Touching mushroom, breathing mushroom?

1307
01:27:04,705 --> 01:27:12,634
JENNIFER: Should we test it first? Touch it to
test it to see if it affects us?

1308
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:16,934
TRAVIS: I'm afraid they might release spores and
then become airborne which is why I only recommend

1309
01:27:16,934 --> 01:27:18,356
trying to burn it first.

1310
01:27:18,356 --> 01:27:21,931
JENNIFER: That would release a lot of spores.

1311
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:25,372
LIAM: How far away can you cast that shit from?

1312
01:27:25,372 --> 01:27:31,828
LAURA: It's ranged about eight. I don't know what
that means.

1313
01:27:31,828 --> 01:27:34,011
MATT: Is this Burning Hands?

1314
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:35,758
LAURA: No, Fire Bolt.

1315
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:39,714
MATT: Oh, Fire Bolt? Oh, it's a pretty decent
range. Just a single hit, yeah.

1316
01:27:39,714 --> 01:27:44,522
LIAM: What if we all back up to our different
sides, yeah? Get back as far as you can and we'll

1317
01:27:44,522 --> 01:27:47,777
get way the fuck back. See what happens.

1318
01:27:47,777 --> 01:27:50,806
LAURA: And then I'll hit it because I can do
cantrips a lot, right?

1319
01:27:50,806 --> 01:27:52,552
MATT: Cantrips you can do as many times as you
want.

1320
01:27:52,552 --> 01:27:54,394
LAURA: Fuck-- I mean heck yeah! I'm going to do--

1321
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,452
TRAVIS: They don't let cursing happen in mage
school either?

1322
01:27:57,452 --> 01:27:59,998
LAURA: They don't curse in mage school. I'm sorry
about that.

1323
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:01,948
MATT: Yeah, they're real tough on that in
Dalaran.

1324
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:03,756
LAURA: They smack your hands. I'll tell you that
much.

1325
01:28:03,756 --> 01:28:09,295
MATT: They wouldn't tell you but Madame had a
potty mouth.

1326
01:28:09,295 --> 01:28:17,448
LAURA: I'm going to cast Fire Bolt at the
mushrooms. That gives me 2d10 fire damage.

1327
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:22,864
MATT: Yes, even with a singular bolt, the
mushroom's pretty big and it's not moving. It's

1328
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:27,578
pretty easy to hit. You hit the first one a while
away and as it impacts you watch as the flames

1329
01:28:27,578 --> 01:28:35,300
burn up. Immediately the strange, subtle squeaking
sound releases as it shakes and shimmies. And you

1330
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:41,388
watch as spores filter out and then ignite from
the nearby flames that immediately destroy the

1331
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:45,857
cloud before it can emerge. And the fungus slowly
withers and crumples over.

1332
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:49,634
LAURA: Okay, good! I do the same thing on all of
the mushrooms that are along the path.

1333
01:28:49,634 --> 01:28:58,323
MATT: Okay. One by one you create this pathway,
destroying the fungus on the opposite side. Are

1334
01:28:58,323 --> 01:28:59,978
you still holding the rope?

1335
01:28:59,978 --> 01:29:01,219
LAURA: Yes.

1336
01:29:01,219 --> 01:29:03,431
MATT: Okay. As the flames begin--

1337
01:29:03,431 --> 01:29:06,363
LAURA: But I went through, remember? I went
through and I'm holding the rope on my side.

1338
01:29:06,363 --> 01:29:10,309
MATT: Right. So as you're destroying these the
rope pulls a little taut to your side as you begin

1339
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:14,412
clearing the path. And you look over and you can
see your friend is peeking around a rock. You can

1340
01:29:14,412 --> 01:29:18,723
see this glow on the other side of a boulder
around the bend where he's looking over and looks

1341
01:29:18,723 --> 01:29:20,652
back at you and is like--

1342
01:29:20,652 --> 01:29:21,892
LAURA: What?

1343
01:29:21,892 --> 01:29:23,182
MATT: (mutters)

1344
01:29:23,182 --> 01:29:24,249
LAURA: Hold on.

1345
01:29:24,249 --> 01:29:28,916
MATT: "Okay." The rest of you guys, there is a
path wide enough to follow through.

1346
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,601
TRAVIS: We join.

1347
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:32,532
LAURA: They're coming? Okay, I go over to Reek.

1348
01:29:32,532 --> 01:29:39,168
MATT: As you guys approach you can see the small
flickering of light shift suddenly and a dark

1349
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:46,737
shape of a figure whips around from behind the
rock. You see a flash of cloth that floats open

1350
01:29:46,737 --> 01:29:52,472
and then drifts down to the side as an arm
uncurls. You can see immediately wide-shouldered,

1351
01:29:52,472 --> 01:29:59,133
a broad long trench coat that swings open to one
side, a clawed, familiar, slightly furred hand

1352
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:06,094
holding it open as a brownish hat, wide-brimmed,
appears with its candle placed on top of the brim.

1353
01:30:06,094 --> 01:30:10,913
You see another kobold standing there looking at
your tied-up friend and the rest of you. And he

1354
01:30:10,913 --> 01:30:20,585
goes, "Hey! Hey! Want to buy a fungus?" As you
look on the inside of the cloak you can see these

1355
01:30:20,585 --> 01:30:28,478
little patchwork pouches of different gathered
mushrooms, orange, green and blue. "I sell, good

1356
01:30:28,478 --> 01:30:30,263
"price. Come. Buy."

1357
01:30:30,263 --> 01:30:32,201
TALIESIN: Well--

1358
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:34,148
LAURA: Well, what do they do?

1359
01:30:34,148 --> 01:30:38,750
MATT: "Taste good! Ugh. Bad. Good bad. Fun!"

1360
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,129
LAURA: I don't understand what he just told me.

1361
01:30:41,129 --> 01:30:45,162
LIAM: I mean, to begin with you're not alarmed by
us being here in the first place?

1362
01:30:45,162 --> 01:30:47,431
MATT: "I need to make money."

1363
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:54,314
TALIESIN: Let's not look a gift horse in the
mouth. A gift rat. Orange?

1364
01:30:54,314 --> 01:31:01,579
MATT: "Orange fungus. Slight citrus-y taste. Weird
fuzzy sensation. 40 gold."

1365
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:05,332
TALIESIN: And the other two were--

1366
01:31:05,332 --> 01:31:06,762
TRAVIS: What about blue?

1367
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:11,190
MATT: "Blue fungus. 30 gold. Make for good
digestion tract."

1368
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,485
TRAVIS: I'll take the blue one.

1369
01:31:13,485 --> 01:31:15,111
LAURA: You have that much gold?

1370
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:16,458
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1371
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:18,549
MATT: You now have a helping of blue fungus.

1372
01:31:18,549 --> 01:31:20,599
TALIESIN: What's the third?

1373
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:28,318
MATT: "Green fungus! 25 gold. More of the onion of
fungus family."

1374
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:30,160
LAURA: That's a good topping.

1375
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,636
MATT: "Yeah!"

1376
01:31:31,636 --> 01:31:37,233
LIAM: I grab rope that is holding Reekcheeks and
bring him over. "You know this one?"

1377
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:44,203
MATT: "He is strange one. Don't like him. I
don't-- kobolds stay away."

1378
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:45,533
LIAM: Is he problem?

1379
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,399
MATT: (whispering) "I don't know."

1380
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:50,105
LAURA: You be nice to him!

1381
01:31:50,105 --> 01:31:53,383
TRAVIS: It's the-- they're real--

1382
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:54,513
LIAM: I punch him in the eye.

1383
01:31:54,513 --> 01:31:55,777
MATT: (cry of pain)

1384
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:57,505
TALIESIN: You only live once. Orange.

1385
01:31:57,505 --> 01:31:59,268
LIAM: You've got to keep them in line with tough
love.

1386
01:31:59,268 --> 01:32:01,252
TALIESIN: I take the orange.

1387
01:32:01,252 --> 01:32:02,265
MATT: All righty.

1388
01:32:02,265 --> 01:32:04,462
TRAVIS: Do I know anything about this blue fungus?

1389
01:32:04,462 --> 01:32:05,835
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1390
01:32:05,835 --> 01:32:08,200
LAURA: It's good for digestion I hear.

1391
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,305
TRAVIS: 16.

1392
01:32:09,305 --> 01:32:10,517
MATT: 16, okay.

1393
01:32:10,517 --> 01:32:13,221
TALIESIN: Oh, 20.

1394
01:32:13,221 --> 01:32:24,971
MATT: Okay. So eating this fungus has a chance of
poisoning you, but also has the opportunity to

1395
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:29,869
heighten your senses and perceptive capabilities
for a short time.

1396
01:32:29,869 --> 01:32:31,912
LAURA: Ooh, it's a gamble.

1397
01:32:31,912 --> 01:32:34,168
TALIESIN: How about mine?

1398
01:32:34,168 --> 01:32:36,193
MATT: So that's the orange one, you got the--

1399
01:32:36,193 --> 01:32:37,429
TALIESIN: I have the orange.

1400
01:32:37,429 --> 01:32:38,418
MATT: You've got the orange.

1401
01:32:38,418 --> 01:32:39,306
LAURA: Yeah, he got the blue.

1402
01:32:39,306 --> 01:32:43,101
MATT: He got the blue, sorry, yeah. So the blue
one has a faint possibility of poisoning you.

1403
01:32:43,101 --> 01:32:48,699
Sorry, you're the blue. The orange one is the one
you got. So you get the heightened senses, yours

1404
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:52,698
has a chance of poisoning you as well and or has
the possibility of healing some hit points.

1405
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:55,661
TALIESIN: Down the hatch.

1406
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:58,811
MATT: All right, both of you make constitution
saving throws.

1407
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:00,538
LIAM: Give it to Mikey, he'll try anything.

1408
01:33:00,538 --> 01:33:05,294
TRAVIS: Now, because you're next to me I have Aura
of Protection which is plus two to saves?

1409
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:06,517
MATT: Yeah, it would.

1410
01:33:06,517 --> 01:33:09,946
TALIESIN: Oh, that helps because my constitution's
really low.

1411
01:33:09,946 --> 01:33:13,812
TRAVIS: Yes! 21.

1412
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:15,133
TALIESIN: Eight.

1413
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,043
MATT: Okay, so you're poisoned for the next hour.

1414
01:33:18,043 --> 01:33:26,016
The poisoned status means all of your
attacks are at disadvantage and your ability

1415
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:34,463
checks are at disadvantage as well. So you have
advantage on all perception and investigation

1416
01:33:34,463 --> 01:33:36,452
checks for the next hour.

1417
01:33:36,452 --> 01:33:38,391
LIAM: Everything is crystal clear.

1418
01:33:38,391 --> 01:33:42,648
MATT: Yeah, your eyes dilate suddenly and I know
kung-fu.

1419
01:33:42,648 --> 01:33:44,362
TRAVIS: Yeah! Show me.

1420
01:33:44,362 --> 01:33:48,206
MATT: Bundle, you heal six hit points.

1421
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:50,946
TALIESIN: I heal six?

1422
01:33:50,946 --> 01:33:52,544
LAURA: Ooh, at least it healed you while it
poisoned you.

1423
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:57,174
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast Lesser
Restoration and make the poison go away.

1424
01:33:57,174 --> 01:34:04,941
MATT: Okay. So the poison vanishes from your
system at which point the kobold, "Mushhuckster

1425
01:34:04,941 --> 01:34:10,988
"Max thanks you. Now off to find new ventures!"
Pulls the cloak in front of his head and darts

1426
01:34:10,988 --> 01:34:15,391
away on little ninja feet. Back through the
mushrooms and vanishes into darkness.

1427
01:34:15,391 --> 01:34:19,706
TALIESIN: It's weird he's selling mushrooms to
random people in caverns like that.

1428
01:34:19,706 --> 01:34:21,811
TRAVIS: I highly recommend the blue fungus.

1429
01:34:21,811 --> 01:34:28,035
LIAM: In another life, I would have hit that guy
before he said a single word. I would have dropped

1430
01:34:28,035 --> 01:34:30,294
his ass.

1431
01:34:30,294 --> 01:34:32,139
TRAVIS: Somehow I know that to be true about you.

1432
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:38,494
MATT: At this point you hear a strange guttural
growl from the path that you were traveling near a

1433
01:34:38,494 --> 01:34:43,254
pillar of stone encased in mushrooms as from
around one back of it you see a shape of a large,

1434
01:34:43,254 --> 01:34:51,729
hunched, bestial dwarf ape-like creature standing
at about six and a half feet tall as its long arms

1435
01:34:51,729 --> 01:34:57,637
drag on the ground. It's drooling down its own
chest. You've experienced, most of you in particular,

1436
01:34:57,637 --> 01:35:05,302
this is a trogg, a large subterranean creature,
but this trogg is acting strange. It's giggling to

1437
01:35:05,302 --> 01:35:11,370
itself. (deep laughter) Holds the pillar and grabs
some mushroom and scarfs it.

1438
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,121
LAURA: Oh no.

1439
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:13,487
JENNIFER: Here we go.

1440
01:35:13,487 --> 01:35:23,320
MATT: (grunts) And he starts walking around the
edge, looks around the edge right to you, "It's

1441
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,144
"real?"

1442
01:35:25,144 --> 01:35:28,594
TALIESIN, JENNIFER, and LAURA: No!

1443
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:30,831
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1444
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:41,841
TALIESIN: Come on! Natural 20! About fucking time!
There we are! No!

1445
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:52,449
MATT: "Too weird! I see things!" You see two other
large troggs come from behind going. They're

1446
01:35:52,449 --> 01:36:01,975
tripping balls. One of them is currently clutching
a long staff of purple and gold inlay and is

1447
01:36:01,975 --> 01:36:06,311
gnawing on it like a large lollipop. You can't see
the top because it's jammed in his mouth. They're

1448
01:36:06,311 --> 01:36:09,485
all looking at you going (laughing).

1449
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:14,162
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thaumaturgy to make us
all look really fuzzy, in and out, if I can do

1450
01:36:14,162 --> 01:36:15,142
that.

1451
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:16,251
MATT: You may.

1452
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,865
TALIESIN: Ooh!

1453
01:36:17,865 --> 01:36:35,199
MATT: No. Okay! They all stand there and watch.
(groaning) One of them picks his nose slowly.

1454
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,221
TALIESIN: I hadn't thought this through.

1455
01:36:38,221 --> 01:36:42,245
LAURA: I use Prestidigitation and create light
flares around him.

1456
01:36:42,245 --> 01:36:47,200
MATT: One elbows one in the chin, the guy who was
holding the staff, he elbows him the chest.

1457
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:55,553
(gagging) Pulls it out. You can see on the top of
the staff, it has these awesome, pointed purple

1458
01:36:55,553 --> 01:37:02,829
stones, three of them in a triangular pattern that
float, locked into place. (licking) Jams it back

1459
01:37:02,829 --> 01:37:04,918
in his mouth and begins chewing on it again.

1460
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:12,282
TALIESIN: Can I make the staff look like it's made
of snakes or something? Can I Thaumaturgy?

1461
01:37:12,282 --> 01:37:15,870
MATT: Unfortunately, that's an illusion spell.
Thaumaturgy is very simple. It's a very faint

1462
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:19,917
effect that wouldn't have an effect if they
weren't already tripping balls.

1463
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,049
LAURA: If they're already tripping can we say:
Whoa, why are you holding that snake in your

1464
01:37:22,049 --> 01:37:23,540
hand?

1465
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,873
MATT: Make a persuasion check!

1466
01:37:26,873 --> 01:37:35,010
LAURA: Please! Oh no, 11.

1467
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:41,488
MATT: 11. He goes (gags). Pulls it out, looks at
it, "Hey, a snake!" and begins trying to bite

1468
01:37:41,488 --> 01:37:44,136
through. You watch as his teeth are breaking on
the metal.

1469
01:37:44,136 --> 01:37:50,740
TRAVIS: I'll cast Command on him and say: drop
that wicked snake!

1470
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:56,758
MATT: Okay! What's your spell DC?

1471
01:37:56,758 --> 01:37:58,098
TRAVIS: 13.

1472
01:37:58,098 --> 01:38:08,848
MATT: He rolled a 13 minus one. This trogg is not
very wise. Drops it. You see he's putting his

1473
01:38:08,848 --> 01:38:12,734
tongue through his mouth and bits of teeth are
falling out of his lips and bouncing off of his

1474
01:38:12,734 --> 01:38:21,246
belly. (grunts) They're all currently entranced by
the movement and the lights that you've created.

1475
01:38:21,246 --> 01:38:26,578
JENNIFER: I'd love to collect the thing.

1476
01:38:26,578 --> 01:38:30,759
MATT: Make a stealth check to see if you can not
gather their gaze as they're currently entranced

1477
01:38:30,759 --> 01:38:31,837
by this.

1478
01:38:31,837 --> 01:38:34,587
TRAVIS: We're doing our best outside inflatable
people.

1479
01:38:34,587 --> 01:38:35,946
JENNIFER: 21.

1480
01:38:35,946 --> 01:38:43,582
MATT: 21. You slowly, subtly go beneath their
eyeline, slip out, and pull the staff away as

1481
01:38:43,582 --> 01:38:50,710
they're all still (gasping). One of them begins
picking his ear, pulls something out, and eats

1482
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:51,710
it.

1483
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:53,341
(groaning)

1484
01:38:53,341 --> 01:38:55,208
LAURA: We should back away slowly.

1485
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:56,959
MATT: (farts)

1486
01:38:56,959 --> 01:39:00,595
TALIESIN: Oh, slowly. Okay!

1487
01:39:00,595 --> 01:39:04,825
LAURA: Reeks, if we leave them, will you keep
guiding the way?

1488
01:39:04,825 --> 01:39:12,235
MATT: "Behind them? The way is where they came
from."

1489
01:39:12,235 --> 01:39:18,973
TRAVIS: Quazi? Feel like introducing yourself?

1490
01:39:18,973 --> 01:39:32,566
LIAM: Good news, my brothers. We come from both
the future and the past.

1491
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:35,695
MATT: All three of them (grunt).

1492
01:39:35,695 --> 01:39:40,942
LIAM: Let me tell you. Your fathers are proud of
you.

1493
01:39:40,942 --> 01:39:50,739
MATT: The two on the sides look in to the one in
the center who goes, "You know father?"

1494
01:39:50,739 --> 01:40:02,839
LIAM: I've been this fucked up before. Your
mothers love you and are proud of you!

1495
01:40:02,839 --> 01:40:05,717
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1496
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:15,302
LIAM: Persuasion, you said. That's 18.

1497
01:40:15,302 --> 01:40:22,577
MATT: 18? His giant, meaty, fur-covered hands clap
onto your shoulders of your armor and pulls you in

1498
01:40:22,577 --> 01:40:28,212
close. You can smell the horrible trogg breath
billow out across your face. Almost thickens the

1499
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:33,969
air around you. It smells of rotting meat and a
multitude of terrible memories.

1500
01:40:33,969 --> 01:40:41,580
LIAM: And the deep secret is: You know that I am
you.

1501
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:52,257
MATT: He releases you and takes a step back and
goes. (sobbing) And starts sobbing openly. The two

1502
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:56,493
other troggs clap the side of his shoulders and
start sobbing, too. The three of them sit in place

1503
01:40:56,493 --> 01:41:02,566
and start having the most basic of existential
crises you could watch.

1504
01:41:02,566 --> 01:41:05,638
TALIESIN: Slowly making our way around the
existential crisis.

1505
01:41:05,638 --> 01:41:08,923
MATT: The rest of you make a stealth check. You
already made one. The rest of you make a stealth

1506
01:41:08,923 --> 01:41:10,041
check.

1507
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:18,550
LIAM: Doing inches this way like an arc. And Papa
and Mama don't want you to hurt you! You have to

1508
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:21,739
love you!

1509
01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:27,980
MATT: You get the sense they're picking up every
third word due to the limits of their language

1510
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:41,128
comprehension. They're like, (grunting) "Love!
(grunting) Ove! (sobbing) Guh!" They're just

1511
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:42,867
making guttural noises at this point.

1512
01:41:42,867 --> 01:41:44,117
LIAM: Give into it.

1513
01:41:44,117 --> 01:41:45,557
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

1514
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:49,427
LIAM: Oh, that's a 20!

1515
01:41:49,427 --> 01:42:00,793
MATT: As you guys slowly curve around the three
sobbing troggs, staff in hand, you exit through

1516
01:42:00,793 --> 01:42:06,328
the tunnel they had passed through. The fungus
begins to give way as the heat begins to rise

1517
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:10,902
steadily once you traverse further into this
tunnel. You're holding the staff. As you're

1518
01:42:10,902 --> 01:42:23,529
walking, looking over it, a slow voice beings to
peek in seemingly from nowhere. It says, "Oh,

1519
01:42:23,529 --> 01:42:31,084
"wondrous. Another unworthy soul. I command you to
throw me into a river and be done with it."

1520
01:42:31,084 --> 01:42:37,646
JENNIFER: Hmm. First, you must tell us your
secrets.

1521
01:42:37,646 --> 01:42:42,866
MATT: "I require a wielder who walks the path of
power, fool."

1522
01:42:42,866 --> 01:42:44,695
LAURA: What's it saying?

1523
01:42:44,695 --> 01:42:49,017
JENNIFER: It requires a wielder who walks the path
of power, fool.

1524
01:42:49,017 --> 01:42:50,037
LAURA: Magic?

1525
01:42:50,037 --> 01:42:52,507
JENNIFER: I'm not calling you a fool, it's calling
you a fool. Magic.

1526
01:42:52,507 --> 01:42:55,267
LAURA: I do magic!

1527
01:42:55,267 --> 01:42:57,242
JENNIFER: Take him.

1528
01:42:57,242 --> 01:43:04,985
MATT: As you take the staff, it warms to your
touch. For a moment, there's an awkward silence

1529
01:43:04,985 --> 01:43:08,544
of: did she actually hear anything, or has your
friend been crazy the whole time you've been

1530
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,703
traveling?

1531
01:43:09,703 --> 01:43:11,192
JENNIFER: Both.

1532
01:43:11,192 --> 01:43:23,025
MATT: A voice slowly echoes in, "Ah, you! You have
potential. A withered seed that could blossom into

1533
01:43:23,025 --> 01:43:25,026
"a tyrant of the arcane."

1534
01:43:25,026 --> 01:43:27,786
LAURA: Well, I'm pretty blossomed already, but
okay.

1535
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:37,501
MATT: "Yes. You will do. I am Aluneth and
together, we will do great things." And that's

1536
01:43:37,501 --> 01:43:39,200
where we're going to take a break.

1537
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:44,110
TRAVIS: Ooh! You've got sentient weapons in this
thing! The little gems are floating in a

1538
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:44,860
triangle?

1539
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:47,481
MATT: They're held aloft by some mystical power.

1540
01:43:47,481 --> 01:43:49,063
LAURA: Fancy!

1541
01:43:49,063 --> 01:43:50,347
MATT: I'll show you pictures of it.

1542
01:43:50,347 --> 01:43:53,900
TRAVIS: Nicely done! Your baptism is going well!

1543
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,785
JENNIFER: Sorry about trying the narrative thing!
I was like: Oh shit!

1544
01:43:56,785 --> 01:44:00,333
MATT: No, it's all good! First time in, you just
figure it out. You're doing great.

1545
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:03,611
JENNIFER: Oh, there's a wall there!

1546
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:07,208
MATT: Thank you guys so much. We're going to to go
break. We'll be back in a few minutes. Rest, get

1547
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:13,675
drinks. We have some fun stuff at the break for
you to watch. You get to check out, if you haven't

1548
01:44:13,675 --> 01:44:18,640
seen it, the song I sing for this expansion.
Pretty sure it's coming up.

1549
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,691
LAURA: Notebooks in the store!

1550
01:44:21,691 --> 01:44:22,802
MATT: Yep!

1551
01:44:22,802 --> 01:44:23,838
JENNIFER: Where's the notebook?

1552
01:44:23,838 --> 01:44:25,338
LIAM: Show the Feywild!

1553
01:44:25,338 --> 01:44:28,587
TALIESIN: Now I want to do Russian now.

1554
01:44:28,587 --> 01:44:30,970
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. We'll
see you then.

1555
01:44:30,970 --> 01:52:00,228
[break]

1556
01:52:00,228 --> 01:52:07,988
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. Before we dive in,
the winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway is

1557
01:52:07,988 --> 01:52:15,411
flashfletch33. So congratulations, flashfletch33.
Danoba will get your contact info and we'll get

1558
01:52:15,411 --> 01:52:26,270
that off to you ASAP. Also, I was just notified
that the chat had discovered: back when vanilla

1559
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:29,434
launch happened, I was one of the people waiting
at the midnight launch of World of Warcraft

1560
01:52:29,434 --> 01:52:36,829
outside of a cold Best Buy in Irvine many years
ago, and started my long trek on the RP server

1561
01:52:36,829 --> 01:52:43,458
Silverhand at launch. I discovered today via
fatalcake23 in the chat that there is both a Vox

1562
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:50,506
Machina and a Slayer's Take guild on the server I
started on, which is so weird and full circle.

1563
01:52:50,506 --> 01:52:52,432
Yeah, we used to play on that server.

1564
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,080
TALIESIN: Yeah, you dragged me onto Silverhand!

1565
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,321
MATT: Yeah, so that's kind of cool. So hi,
everybody on Silverhand and those guilds and

1566
01:52:57,321 --> 01:52:58,603
beyond.

1567
01:52:58,603 --> 01:53:01,104
TALIESIN and MATT: It's been a while.

1568
01:53:01,104 --> 01:53:04,979
LIAM: We are such fake nerds.

1569
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:06,942
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Totes fake.

1570
01:53:06,942 --> 01:53:08,665
TRAVIS: I just want to go deadlift right now.

1571
01:53:08,665 --> 01:53:09,973
JENNIFER: I aspire to nerd.

1572
01:53:09,973 --> 01:53:11,410
MATT: You aspire what?

1573
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,621
JENNIFER: I aspire to nerd.

1574
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:15,993
MATT: All right. So as we come back in, you have
acquired--

1575
01:53:15,993 --> 01:53:21,556
LAURA: Yay! Should I read it out loud?

1576
01:53:21,556 --> 01:53:22,696
MATT: If you'd like to.

1577
01:53:22,696 --> 01:53:28,741
LAURA: I have acquired Aluneth. "This ancient,
extremely powerful staff was once owned by

1578
01:53:28,741 --> 01:53:32,555
"Aegwynn." Egwin. Agewin.

1579
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:33,845
MATT: Sure.

1580
01:53:33,845 --> 01:53:39,915
LAURA: "The only female guardian of Tirisfal. This
staff carries a mind far more ancient than most

1581
01:53:39,915 --> 01:53:46,613
"things in Azeroth." My spell attack rolls gain a
+3 to hit. Whenever I deal damage, I deal two

1582
01:53:46,613 --> 01:53:51,570
additional hit points of force damage. That's
amazing.

1583
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:58,601
MATT: As you're clutching the staff, as it speaks
to you in your mind: "Together, we will do great

1584
01:53:58,601 --> 01:54:07,059
"things. But you must survive. So: be smart. Stay
alive. And perhaps ditch these unnecessary

1585
01:54:07,059 --> 01:54:08,476
"dregs."

1586
01:54:08,476 --> 01:54:11,413
LAURA: They're pretty cool, actually. Well, some
of them.

1587
01:54:11,413 --> 01:54:12,577
TRAVIS: Who's cool?

1588
01:54:12,577 --> 01:54:13,750
LAURA: What?

1589
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:15,062
TALIESIN: Well, I'm cool.

1590
01:54:15,062 --> 01:54:15,999
LAURA: What are you talking about?

1591
01:54:15,999 --> 01:54:17,656
LIAM: What are you doing? Did you eat mushrooms?

1592
01:54:17,656 --> 01:54:19,065
TRAVIS: You said "They're pretty cool."

1593
01:54:19,065 --> 01:54:21,303
LIAM: You were talking out loud to no one.

1594
01:54:21,303 --> 01:54:24,596
LAURA: Oh, no! It's the staff! It has a voice!

1595
01:54:24,596 --> 01:54:27,039
JENNIFER: What did it say? I heard it.

1596
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:33,210
LAURA: It said that I'm really amazing and that
I'm going to do good things. I think that it's

1597
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:39,206
like a really powerful weapon. It's like the kind
of thing you take with you for several levels at

1598
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,229
least.

1599
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:42,189
TALIESIN: How did we agree that you get the epic
loot drop?

1600
01:54:42,189 --> 01:54:43,488
TRAVIS: Staff of flirting.

1601
01:54:43,488 --> 01:54:46,682
JENNIFER: He wouldn't speak to me. I'm too tall.

1602
01:54:46,682 --> 01:54:48,620
LAURA: That's probably what it is.

1603
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:52,063
LIAM: I think it's your own positive nature,
speaking to you from yourself.

1604
01:54:52,063 --> 01:54:57,069
LAURA: That's possible. My mama and papa are very
proud of me.

1605
01:54:57,069 --> 01:55:00,450
LIAM: I mean, that's up to you and them. I don't
know shit about that.

1606
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:02,284
JENNIFER: Is he you?

1607
01:55:02,284 --> 01:55:04,514
LAURA: Is it a he? I don't know.

1608
01:55:04,514 --> 01:55:06,868
JENNIFER: Is <i>he</i> you?

1609
01:55:06,868 --> 01:55:09,566
LAURA: Oh, him? Not staff. I'm confused.

1610
01:55:09,566 --> 01:55:15,000
MATT: Your perceptive Night Elf sense picks out
the air becoming more sulfurous as you progress.

1611
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,711
You all begin to feel a bit uncomfortable in your
armor as the temperature gets warmer and warmer.

1612
01:55:21,711 --> 01:55:30,530
As this tunnel descends slightly and then comes to
an abrupt leveling point, you can see a faint

1613
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:36,778
orange glow begin to fill the chamber before you
as the pathway opens up to a large, cavernous

1614
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:44,867
dome. The floor of this new chamber is cracked,
with dark soot, and brittle, black rock. The room

1615
01:55:44,867 --> 01:55:51,017
seems to maintain its own atmospheric,
reddish-orange glow across the entirety of the

1616
01:55:51,017 --> 01:55:58,674
roof. Roughly 30 feet into this chamber, you get a
glance at the source of light as the rocky floor

1617
01:55:58,674 --> 01:56:04,934
suddenly drops off into a river of roiling, molten
magma. The heat at this point is extremely

1618
01:56:04,934 --> 01:56:10,349
intense, causing you to squint as you back away
from the edge. There's a series of pillars that

1619
01:56:10,349 --> 01:56:18,458
rise from the lava into platforms. In fact, it
looks like at one point, two wide stone bridges

1620
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:24,841
that were perpendicular, meeting in the center,
once reached across this lava field, both from

1621
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:29,894
where you stand and then one on two opposite ends
of this cavern, where you can see openings on the

1622
01:56:29,894 --> 01:56:34,992
opposite end to the right of where you are, and
then to the left, it appears a portion of it has

1623
01:56:34,992 --> 01:56:39,876
collapsed and closed it off. These bridges,
however, through time and erosion, have fallen in

1624
01:56:39,876 --> 01:56:45,029
parts. And to give you a visual perspective of
what you're glancing at, you entered from this

1625
01:56:45,029 --> 01:56:51,221
chamber. These are the existing platforms still.
The shaded elements represent ones that are down

1626
01:56:51,221 --> 01:56:56,913
in the lava, and resting there. There's a slight
alcove over here, there's a number of dotted bits

1627
01:56:56,913 --> 01:57:02,348
here and here, this appears to have collapsed, and
there's an opening here and an opening here.

1628
01:57:02,348 --> 01:57:04,538
You're currently on this platform.

1629
01:57:04,538 --> 01:57:12,569
TALIESIN: See, this would have been an appropriate
place to build bridges that are kind of iffy. Two

1630
01:57:12,569 --> 01:57:14,118
of them, even.

1631
01:57:14,118 --> 01:57:17,318
LAURA: Yeah. Hey, Reeks?

1632
01:57:17,318 --> 01:57:18,841
MATT: "What?"

1633
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:20,887
LAURA: Which direction is your king?

1634
01:57:20,887 --> 01:57:27,967
MATT: "Uh--" And he bends forward and tries to get
one hand up, and the finger goes like--

1635
01:57:27,967 --> 01:57:33,771
LAURA: Hey, look! Your hands are working again!

1636
01:57:33,771 --> 01:57:36,765
MATT: "Ow!"

1637
01:57:36,765 --> 01:57:44,119
(laughter)

1638
01:57:44,119 --> 01:57:46,026
LIAM: Mind over matter.

1639
01:57:46,026 --> 01:57:50,648
MATT: "They mostly just let me through."

1640
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:54,039
LAURA: Oh, Okay, well, we'll figure it out.

1641
01:57:54,039 --> 01:57:57,028
TRAVIS: Now, now, you know King Tagwaggle will be
very disappointed--

1642
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,331
MATT: "<i>Togwaggle!</i>"

1643
01:57:58,331 --> 01:58:03,012
TRAVIS: Togwaggle will be very disappointed if we
are not brought before him.

1644
01:58:03,012 --> 01:58:14,051
MATT: "Wait. Across." And the finger, the broken
hand, tries to lift up. "Across. I remember! That

1645
01:58:14,051 --> 01:58:16,042
"way. That way to Togwaggle."

1646
01:58:16,042 --> 01:58:17,850
LAURA: Straight across?

1647
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:18,715
MATT: "Yes."

1648
01:58:18,715 --> 01:58:26,022
TALIESIN: I want to take a quick insight check and
give him an eye. I don't trust this one. That's

1649
01:58:26,022 --> 01:58:28,398
not bad. That's a 16.

1650
01:58:28,398 --> 01:58:42,334
MATT: 16? Kind of hard to read. You get the sense
that something doesn't sit right with the way he's

1651
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:43,739
saying it.

1652
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:53,484
LIAM: Aerwin, do you see anything hinky in this
room? Anything off? Bad?

1653
01:58:53,484 --> 01:58:55,447
MATT: You can make a perception check if you
like.

1654
01:58:55,447 --> 01:58:56,910
JENNIFER: I'd like to make a perception check.

1655
01:58:56,910 --> 01:58:59,298
TRAVIS: Can I join her with my heightened senses
from my blue fungi?

1656
01:58:59,298 --> 01:59:01,374
MATT: You may. With advantage.

1657
01:59:01,374 --> 01:59:07,209
LIAM: What's that? Okay, that's 16, plus
perception.

1658
01:59:07,209 --> 01:59:09,256
JENNIFER: So, 23.

1659
01:59:09,256 --> 01:59:10,569
TRAVIS: 18.

1660
01:59:10,569 --> 01:59:17,142
MATT: All right. So as you both glance over, you
notice the part that's collapsed and taken down

1661
01:59:17,142 --> 01:59:22,005
that portion of the bridge, there is no way
through. It is completely sealed off. You both

1662
01:59:22,005 --> 01:59:27,458
notice simultaneously, on the central cross
platform in the center of the chamber, where you

1663
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:32,451
see across the broken center there's a bunch of
scraps of metal. Empty shells of armor

1664
01:59:32,451 --> 01:59:38,906
plates that have been left there and have long
been covered in dust and soot. <i>You</i> notice with

1665
01:59:38,906 --> 01:59:45,359
your fair vision that the small alcove on the far
end of the upper corner that's down near the

1666
01:59:45,359 --> 01:59:53,592
surface of the lava, it appears to be two figures
lying down in the shadows there. You can't make

1667
01:59:53,592 --> 01:59:58,745
out much more detail than that, but there appears
to be two humanoid entities that are currently

1668
01:59:58,745 --> 02:00:01,341
resting on that platform.

1669
02:00:01,341 --> 02:00:05,798
LAURA: They're laying a trap. I'll bet you
anything.

1670
02:00:05,798 --> 02:00:07,475
JENNIFER: We need to get closer.

1671
02:00:07,475 --> 02:00:09,302
TALIESIN: With darkvision, could I see them?

1672
02:00:09,302 --> 02:00:12,317
MATT: At this distance, no. You'll probably have
to get closer to the central platform to get a

1673
02:00:12,317 --> 02:00:13,324
better view.

1674
02:00:13,324 --> 02:00:19,626
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to try and go for
the central platform.

1675
02:00:19,626 --> 02:00:27,702
LAURA: Wait! But you just said there's a big pile
of metal in the middle, and two creatures hiding!

1676
02:00:27,702 --> 02:00:31,173
What if they're waiting to explode the middle?

1677
02:00:31,173 --> 02:00:33,970
LIAM: And we're standing here talking in this
chamber.

1678
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:39,433
JENNIFER: Could I take some of my ball bearings
and go across? I have my ball bearings in my

1679
02:00:39,433 --> 02:00:43,080
pocket to trip them, and go across and try to get
closer.

1680
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,859
MATT: You could throw them out in front of you to
try and see if it hits them.

1681
02:00:45,859 --> 02:00:49,373
JENNIFER: No, I'll have them with me in case I
need them as a defense. Can I sneak across to see

1682
02:00:49,373 --> 02:00:50,471
them?

1683
02:00:50,471 --> 02:00:53,903
MATT: Okay. So you pull out your small pouch of
ball bearings, hold them in your hand. Go and make

1684
02:00:53,903 --> 02:00:55,455
a stealth check.

1685
02:00:55,455 --> 02:00:59,540
LIAM: That's good. You're going to be good.

1686
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:00,990
JENNIFER: 23.

1687
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:06,138
MATT: That's not bad. You have to leap across to
get to the smaller platform that's going up,

1688
02:01:06,138 --> 02:01:12,799
because there are the breaks in it. What's your
strength? Ten?

1689
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:14,196
JENNIFER: Zero.

1690
02:01:14,196 --> 02:01:18,440
MATT: Right, so maximum ten. So you get about a
10-foot jump across that way. It's about a 10-foot

1691
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:25,003
jump to get to that smaller platform. You, keeping
low, using the balls of your feet, make a leap for

1692
02:01:25,003 --> 02:01:30,216
it, just catching the edge ever so carefully. If
you can make an acrobatics check to use your

1693
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:32,166
momentum to tumble onto it.

1694
02:01:32,166 --> 02:01:37,594
LIAM: Acrobatics, you say?

1695
02:01:37,594 --> 02:01:39,265
JENNIFER: 12 total.

1696
02:01:39,265 --> 02:01:46,008
MATT: 12! Okay. You barely use your momentum to
not tumble backward towards the molten rock below.

1697
02:01:46,008 --> 02:01:50,964
Using your shoulder, you roll, and using your
momentum you come to the other side of that and

1698
02:01:50,964 --> 02:01:58,164
leap a second time towards that other side of that
platform. I need you to make one more check for

1699
02:01:58,164 --> 02:01:59,323
me.

1700
02:01:59,323 --> 02:02:03,837
JENNIFER: 13.

1701
02:02:03,837 --> 02:02:10,616
MATT: 13. All right. So you leap, tumble, and you
make your way across the platform. As you stand

1702
02:02:10,616 --> 02:02:18,235
there, looking around, you get a quick glance down
into that little alcove below as you take in the

1703
02:02:18,235 --> 02:02:23,880
circumstance. You see there, there are two
figures. They are armored, they are lying down,

1704
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:31,180
and they are skeletal. They are long burned away.
The flesh is gone. They long died there. Either

1705
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:38,062
they were trapped and couldn't find a way out and
slowly starved or dehydrated, but there's nothing

1706
02:02:38,062 --> 02:02:45,752
but a pile of their equipment, their weapons,
their armor, and bone. At this point, the floor

1707
02:02:45,752 --> 02:02:53,107
below you gently rumbles a bit, and you watch as
some of the metal scraps scrape across the ground

1708
02:02:53,107 --> 02:03:01,802
on their own. They leap up into the air and form
bracers, some sort of large, thick pieces of

1709
02:03:01,802 --> 02:03:08,779
armor, separate, as molten rock shoots up and
flame ignites, filling the center of the empty

1710
02:03:08,779 --> 02:03:15,180
armor into a large, elemental-like enemy made of
fire and magma within the armor. You watch as this

1711
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:21,155
magma rager, appearing, giving this flexing roar,
goes charging towards you. What are you doing?

1712
02:03:21,155 --> 02:03:23,958
JENNIFER: Am I doing this?

1713
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:27,457
MATT: Well, you're definitely not hidden from it
yet. You have to hide first.

1714
02:03:27,457 --> 02:03:32,388
JENNIFER: Okay. Strength is not my thing. I think
I'm going to run.

1715
02:03:32,388 --> 02:03:39,924
MATT: Okay. So you run back the opposite
direction, leap, head across the way. Go ahead and

1716
02:03:39,924 --> 02:03:41,358
make an acrobatics check.

1717
02:03:41,358 --> 02:03:43,704
JENNIFER: 22.

1718
02:03:43,704 --> 02:03:47,450
MATT: Fine. You spin, roll off your shoulder,
leap, a second time on the other side, and make

1719
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,899
one more acrobatics check.

1720
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:52,183
JENNIFER: 16.

1721
02:03:52,183 --> 02:03:55,753
MATT: Not a problem. You make it across to the
other side and you watch as this large, raging

1722
02:03:55,753 --> 02:04:02,984
elemental stops at the edge, scoots back, and
stands there, waiting, on the center platform.

1723
02:04:02,984 --> 02:04:06,259
JENNIFER: Well, at least now we know.

1724
02:04:06,259 --> 02:04:11,110
LAURA: That's intimidating. What about the two
things laying in wait? Were they setting a trap?

1725
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:14,075
JENNIFER: They were skeletons. They were done.
They were dead.

1726
02:04:14,075 --> 02:04:15,209
LAURA: They were undead?

1727
02:04:15,209 --> 02:04:16,220
JENNIFER: They're dead.

1728
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,094
LAURA: Just dead.

1729
02:04:17,094 --> 02:04:18,270
JENNIFER: They were regular dead.

1730
02:04:18,270 --> 02:04:23,283
LIAM: Well, that's iffy. You know. But also
tempting. Because what did they have when they

1731
02:04:23,283 --> 02:04:24,543
died?

1732
02:04:24,543 --> 02:04:25,950
LAURA: We should definitely check it out.

1733
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:27,316
LIAM: I can chuck you over.

1734
02:04:27,316 --> 02:04:30,106
LAURA: But there's a giant flame monster.

1735
02:04:30,106 --> 02:04:32,050
LIAM: Well, yeah. First one thing, then the
other.

1736
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:34,001
LAURA: How are we going to beat him?

1737
02:04:34,001 --> 02:04:35,479
TRAVIS: I could stun him.

1738
02:04:35,479 --> 02:04:37,402
LAURA: You think that would work?

1739
02:04:37,402 --> 02:04:40,020
TRAVIS: Might. We'd have to be fast. And no one
could fall.

1740
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,651
LIAM: I'm not going to fall.

1741
02:04:44,651 --> 02:04:46,187
TRAVIS: Why did you think I was saying that you
would fall?

1742
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:47,239
LIAM: You were staring straight at me.

1743
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:48,150
TRAVIS: Was I?

1744
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:49,018
LIAM: Oh, yes.

1745
02:04:49,018 --> 02:04:50,201
TRAVIS: One of us could fall.

1746
02:04:50,201 --> 02:04:51,775
LIAM: Now you seem sarcastic, because you're
rolling your eyes.

1747
02:04:51,775 --> 02:04:58,821
LAURA: I'm not very good at jumping, but I can
cast Fly on myself.

1748
02:04:58,821 --> 02:05:02,863
JENNIFER: (gasps) She is invisible. She has
invisibility.

1749
02:05:02,863 --> 02:05:08,864
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we have to get to-- did you
trust Skeever?

1750
02:05:08,864 --> 02:05:10,654
LAURA: Reeks?

1751
02:05:10,654 --> 02:05:11,688
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1752
02:05:11,688 --> 02:05:16,311
LAURA: Well... Hey, that's a good point. Reeks?

1753
02:05:16,311 --> 02:05:17,748
MATT: "Yes?"

1754
02:05:17,748 --> 02:05:20,601
LAURA: Why didn't you warn us about the giant
monster in the middle there?

1755
02:05:20,601 --> 02:05:22,972
MATT: "Sorry, I forgot."

1756
02:05:22,972 --> 02:05:24,263
LAURA: Did you?

1757
02:05:24,263 --> 02:05:25,162
MATT: "Yes."

1758
02:05:25,162 --> 02:05:26,750
LAURA: What happened to your voice?

1759
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:28,084
MATT: "What?"

1760
02:05:28,084 --> 02:05:38,319
JENNIFER: Did they die from the monster in the
middle because they are on the far side? Or did

1761
02:05:38,319 --> 02:05:41,782
they die trying to get out that entrance because
it is not really an entrance?

1762
02:05:41,782 --> 02:05:50,840
LAURA: That's deep. Maybe they just fell, and they
couldn't climb back up.

1763
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:56,715
TRAVIS: They had to have gotten there for a
reason, right?

1764
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:59,421
LIAM: There are these big bruisers floating there,
staring at us.

1765
02:05:59,421 --> 02:06:00,853
MATT: Just staring at you, yeah.

1766
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,043
LIAM: You can fly.

1767
02:06:02,043 --> 02:06:02,962
LAURA: Yeah!

1768
02:06:02,962 --> 02:06:07,395
LIAM: I have seen you do it so many times. Can't
you skirt the edge of this room and go over there?

1769
02:06:07,395 --> 02:06:08,686
You don't need to go through this guy.

1770
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:10,112
LAURA: Over to the alcove?

1771
02:06:10,112 --> 02:06:14,442
LIAM: Sure, see if there is anything worth, you
know. This is what we live for.

1772
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:16,043
LAURA: I can try.

1773
02:06:16,043 --> 02:06:19,335
TRAVIS: Fly fly away. Fly far away.

1774
02:06:19,335 --> 02:06:23,257
LIAM: I am not going, too much hassle.

1775
02:06:23,257 --> 02:06:29,913
MATT: "Be careful. It's dangerous. Big fire
thing."

1776
02:06:29,913 --> 02:06:33,306
LAURA: Okay. What did you say?

1777
02:06:33,306 --> 02:06:34,960
MATT: "Big fire thing."

1778
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,266
LAURA: Yeah, how do you make him go back to
sleep?

1779
02:06:37,266 --> 02:06:39,596
MATT: "Don't let him know you came."

1780
02:06:39,596 --> 02:06:46,041
LAURA: Okay. Tell you what, Lohkor. Will you hold
his leash, please?

1781
02:06:46,041 --> 02:06:47,572
TRAVIS: Sure!

1782
02:06:47,572 --> 02:06:53,830
LAURA: I'm going to fly! I know exactly how to do
it.

1783
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:57,732
MATT: You cast it on yourself. It's a
concentration for I believe up to an hour?

1784
02:06:57,732 --> 02:06:59,048
LAURA: Ten minutes!

1785
02:06:59,048 --> 02:07:00,468
MATT: Ten minutes. Even better.

1786
02:07:00,468 --> 02:07:04,083
LAURA: Sure, yeah, I'm going to fly. And I'm going
to try to go over to that little alcove and see

1787
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,235
what happens.

1788
02:07:05,235 --> 02:07:08,461
MATT: All right. So you watch as the tiny gnome
suddenly takes off and begins gliding across the

1789
02:07:08,461 --> 02:07:11,874
roof of this magma area.

1790
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:14,191
LAURA: And I'm giving the creature a wide berth.

1791
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:15,945
LIAM: Look, Laura, you're finally doing it.

1792
02:07:15,945 --> 02:07:24,192
MATT: As you're doing it, you watch as the magma
rager stares and tracks her as she goes. And as

1793
02:07:24,192 --> 02:07:29,949
you head across the way, it shifts to the very
edge of the platform, almost tensing at the border

1794
02:07:29,949 --> 02:07:35,285
and watches as you slowly descend towards this
platform. As you come down, make a perception

1795
02:07:35,285 --> 02:07:36,834
check.

1796
02:07:36,834 --> 02:07:41,790
LAURA: 17.

1797
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:47,387
MATT: Glancing, you look down. Yeah, they are
charred and long dead. The armor appears to be

1798
02:07:47,387 --> 02:07:51,121
burned away. There are a few pieces of equipment
that have lasted okay, although covered in black

1799
02:07:51,121 --> 02:07:55,736
soot. There's a couple of small satchels that are
left there and looks like they were back to back.

1800
02:07:55,736 --> 02:07:59,494
Just hoping for help or trying to find a way off,
and eventually, they expired.

1801
02:07:59,494 --> 02:08:04,871
LAURA: I'm sorry you had a tragic ending. I'm
going to keep flying around them. I don't want to

1802
02:08:04,871 --> 02:08:09,289
touch my feet to the ground, in case something
comes out of the ground. But I'm going to dig

1803
02:08:09,289 --> 02:08:11,508
through all of their shit and see what I can find.

1804
02:08:11,508 --> 02:08:13,198
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1805
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:17,119
TRAVIS: Wow. One.

1806
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:23,731
LAURA: Goodbye.

1807
02:08:23,731 --> 02:08:33,938
MATT: Okay. Glancing through, most of it falls
apart as you grasp it. The armor crumples and

1808
02:08:33,938 --> 02:08:39,493
falls apart as you touch the armor. The only thing
that catches your attention because it is the one

1809
02:08:39,493 --> 02:08:44,111
piece of equipment that is shining amongst the
rest, is in one of the sheaths. There is a blade,

1810
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:49,172
that as you pull it out, it's got this beautifully
wicked metal that curves into a point at the end,

1811
02:08:49,172 --> 02:08:54,659
like a forked point. It's got a bit of an energy
pulse gem in the center of where the hilt is. And

1812
02:08:54,659 --> 02:09:00,719
as you reach over to look at it, it looks pristine
untouched by time. (burps) Pardon me! A little

1813
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:05,018
effervescent tonight, apparently! The soot wipes
off of it cleanly.

1814
02:09:05,018 --> 02:09:16,488
LAURA: I hold it aloft. I found a weapon. I'll
bring it back over to you guys.

1815
02:09:16,488 --> 02:09:18,030
LIAM: I also talk to you.

1816
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:24,467
MATT: At this point, Aluneth does whisper and say
"You've already found a weapon. This is of no use

1817
02:09:24,467 --> 02:09:25,419
"to you."

1818
02:09:25,419 --> 02:09:27,589
LAURA: I'm not going to keep it. I'm going to give
it away.

1819
02:09:27,589 --> 02:09:33,829
MATT: "Good. The sooner, the better." Goes silent.
You watch as, coasting over, blade forth, the magma

1820
02:09:33,829 --> 02:09:38,380
rager still tensing against the edge as she flies
overhead.

1821
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:41,839
LAURA: I wave it towards the creature as I fly by,
but I don't get close enough to really do

1822
02:09:41,839 --> 02:09:43,014
anything.

1823
02:09:43,014 --> 02:09:45,958
MATT: Greldamine finally lands on the ground,
presenting the blade.

1824
02:09:45,958 --> 02:09:47,643
LIAM: What kind of blade? How big is this thing?

1825
02:09:47,643 --> 02:09:50,890
MATT: It's a longsword. It's big for a longsword,
but it does technically act as a longsword.

1826
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:56,368
LAURA: Which one of you would like this beautiful
blade?

1827
02:09:56,368 --> 02:10:00,594
TRAVIS: I would like to see it.

1828
02:10:00,594 --> 02:10:02,862
LIAM: I would also, but I would do roshambo with
you.

1829
02:10:02,862 --> 02:10:03,750
TRAVIS: Yep.

1830
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:05,992
LIAM: Okay. Best out of three, or just one time?

1831
02:10:05,992 --> 02:10:07,162
TRAVIS: One time. Throw on four.

1832
02:10:07,162 --> 02:10:10,556
LIAM: On four?! I have intelligence of eight.

1833
02:10:10,556 --> 02:10:12,093
TRAVIS: Throw on three.

1834
02:10:12,093 --> 02:10:13,217
LIAM: Throw on three?

1835
02:10:13,217 --> 02:10:14,317
TRAVIS: Throw on one.

1836
02:10:14,317 --> 02:10:22,362
LIAM: Why are you changing it on me? Let's do it
on two. We go one, two, shoot. Okay? All right.

1837
02:10:22,362 --> 02:10:31,952
One, two, shoot! Oh shit, two papers. We go again.
One, two, shoot! Give me that shit.

1838
02:10:31,952 --> 02:10:36,358
MATT: It's a very fine blade.

1839
02:10:36,358 --> 02:10:39,096
JENNIFER: What's the name of her sword again?

1840
02:10:39,096 --> 02:10:40,362
MATT: Aluneth.

1841
02:10:40,362 --> 02:10:41,768
LAURA: It's a staff.

1842
02:10:41,768 --> 02:10:44,617
JENNIFER: Sorry. Does Aluneth have anything to say
about where we are?

1843
02:10:44,617 --> 02:10:51,343
LAURA: Oh mighty Aluneth, do you have anything to
say about where we are?

1844
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,271
LIAM: You seem very crazy right now.

1845
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:54,804
LAURA: It talks, I swear.

1846
02:10:54,804 --> 02:11:03,958
MATT: The voice comes back in from the aether. "I
do despise these subterranean regions. I don't

1847
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:09,426
"recognize where we are. This world has changed
quite a bit since I last walked its surface."

1848
02:11:09,426 --> 02:11:11,732
LAURA: Yes.

1849
02:11:11,732 --> 02:11:14,582
JENNIFER: How long since you walked its surface?

1850
02:11:14,582 --> 02:11:18,462
LAURA: How long since you walked its surface? I
mean, I know, I've heard about Aluneth before.

1851
02:11:18,462 --> 02:11:19,938
It's very ancient.

1852
02:11:19,938 --> 02:11:26,600
MATT: "Of course you have. I don't know,
generations."

1853
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,525
LAURA: Long time.

1854
02:11:28,525 --> 02:11:31,187
TALIESIN: Could you fly over to the--

1855
02:11:31,187 --> 02:11:34,318
MATT: Do you wish to attune to the weapon?

1856
02:11:34,318 --> 02:11:38,021
LIAM: Hell yeah. I am attuned to nothing, so I
will attune to this.

1857
02:11:38,021 --> 02:11:41,166
LAURA: You want me to go over to the collapse?

1858
02:11:41,166 --> 02:11:45,071
TALIESIN: Yeah, lead the creature over to that
section.

1859
02:11:45,071 --> 02:11:51,003
LAURA: Oh, okay! I'm going to fly over to the
collapsed area, because I've still got a little

1860
02:11:51,003 --> 02:11:52,203
time left, right?

1861
02:11:52,203 --> 02:11:54,111
MATT: Okay, so you coast over to the collapsed
area.

1862
02:11:54,111 --> 02:11:57,734
LAURA: And I land. Now what do you want me to do?

1863
02:11:57,734 --> 02:12:00,509
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Hold Person on
the creature.

1864
02:12:00,509 --> 02:12:03,952
LAURA: Wait, I'll wave my arms so he walks toward
me.

1865
02:12:03,952 --> 02:12:05,988
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1866
02:12:05,988 --> 02:12:08,210
TALIESIN: God, it won't work on him, will it?

1867
02:12:08,210 --> 02:12:11,763
MATT: Yeah, so the creature heads over and it's
focused on you. What'd you get?

1868
02:12:11,763 --> 02:12:13,787
TALIESIN: I got 20.

1869
02:12:13,787 --> 02:12:18,876
MATT: 20. You get the sense that Hold Person
mainly affects small humanoid creatures. A large

1870
02:12:18,876 --> 02:12:20,813
elemental like this would not be held by a spell.

1871
02:12:20,813 --> 02:12:22,581
LAURA: Is an elemental considered a monster?

1872
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:24,169
MATT: It's considered a monster.

1873
02:12:24,169 --> 02:12:25,445
TRAVIS: Creature, though.

1874
02:12:25,445 --> 02:12:29,088
MATT: So you discovered your weapon.

1875
02:12:29,088 --> 02:12:35,998
LIAM: Yes. This was made for me. Should I be
describing this to the table? Yes, this is called

1876
02:12:35,998 --> 02:12:42,284
Adventurefury, Blessed Blade of the Thrillseeker.
This weirdly pristine longsword is encased in

1877
02:12:42,284 --> 02:12:47,172
meticulous, almost gaudy, gold scrolling and
rune-like carvings that spell out phrases like,

1878
02:12:47,172 --> 02:12:53,831
"Carpe Diem", like your shirt with donut, and "You
only live once." You gain plus two to all attacks

1879
02:12:53,831 --> 02:12:58,267
and damage rolls made with this weapon. You are
immune to fear and, if you ever attempt to flee

1880
02:12:58,267 --> 02:13:04,859
from danger, you must make a wisdom saving throw,
DC 12. On a failure, you instead rush toward the

1881
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:07,435
challenge in hopes of glory. YOLO!

1882
02:13:07,435 --> 02:13:10,067
TRAVIS: Yes! That's a great item!

1883
02:13:10,067 --> 02:13:12,272
MATT: It's Adventurefury, Blessed Blade of the
Thrillseeker.

1884
02:13:12,272 --> 02:13:14,871
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Damn!

1885
02:13:14,871 --> 02:13:16,601
LAURA: Is that an actual blade in the game?

1886
02:13:16,601 --> 02:13:17,781
MATT: (chuckling) No.

1887
02:13:17,781 --> 02:13:20,309
LAURA: Please make it an actual weapon in the
game.

1888
02:13:20,309 --> 02:13:23,079
MATT: It's an inside joke.

1889
02:13:23,079 --> 02:13:27,238
LIAM: For Argus and for LRJenkins1234.

1890
02:13:27,238 --> 02:13:35,404
TRAVIS: I could try to stun him if we all wanted
to make a break for one side or the other. I'm not

1891
02:13:35,404 --> 02:13:39,257
sure if it would work, so, any other ideas?

1892
02:13:39,257 --> 02:13:41,862
JENNIFER: Which side?

1893
02:13:41,862 --> 02:13:47,093
LAURA: Straight through, I think! I mean, that's
what Reek said.

1894
02:13:47,093 --> 02:13:48,593
TRAVIS: Wasn't Reek lying?

1895
02:13:48,593 --> 02:13:51,085
LAURA: No! He's very trustworthy.

1896
02:13:51,085 --> 02:13:55,247
JENNIFER: I think there's something on the other
side that we don't know. We need to know.

1897
02:13:55,247 --> 02:13:57,438
TRAVIS: I cast Zone of Truth.

1898
02:13:57,438 --> 02:14:04,687
MATT: Okay. What's your spell DC? Oh, 13, right?
Nope.

1899
02:14:04,687 --> 02:14:05,996
LAURA: Yay!

1900
02:14:05,996 --> 02:14:13,565
TRAVIS: Cheeker-- what's his name? Oh, right,
Reek.

1901
02:14:13,565 --> 02:14:16,081
MATT: "Reeksus."

1902
02:14:16,081 --> 02:14:21,007
TRAVIS: Do you really know the way back to
Tagwaggle?

1903
02:14:21,007 --> 02:14:22,823
MATT: "I do, yes!"

1904
02:14:22,823 --> 02:14:24,478
TRAVIS: Which direction is it?

1905
02:14:24,478 --> 02:14:29,072
MATT: "That would be (straining) right!"

1906
02:14:29,072 --> 02:14:34,660
LAURA: He lied to me!

1907
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:38,175
TRAVIS: He did. I'm sure it's nothing personal,
though!

1908
02:14:38,175 --> 02:14:39,954
MATT: "I'm bad with directions!"

1909
02:14:39,954 --> 02:14:49,900
LAURA: He's telling the truth! Do you like us?
Aww. Do you like me?

1910
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:52,495
TRAVIS: No, he has to answer.

1911
02:14:52,495 --> 02:14:56,157
MATT: "I endure you!"

1912
02:14:56,157 --> 02:14:58,637
LAURA: I'll take it!

1913
02:14:58,637 --> 02:15:00,783
MATT: I endure you.

1914
02:15:00,783 --> 02:15:03,596
LIAM: Hey, Shakira, do you fear me?

1915
02:15:03,596 --> 02:15:05,624
MATT: (panicked wimper)

1916
02:15:05,624 --> 02:15:08,082
LIAM: Good, that's all that matters. Let's go.

1917
02:15:08,082 --> 02:15:09,489
LAURA: I think I'm running out of my ten minutes.

1918
02:15:09,489 --> 02:15:11,277
MATT: You're getting down to the last couple of
minutes.

1919
02:15:11,277 --> 02:15:14,137
LAURA: I need to stand up and I need to fly away
from this place, or else I'm going to be stranded

1920
02:15:14,137 --> 02:15:15,316
on this side!

1921
02:15:15,316 --> 02:15:16,919
TALIESIN: You can land wherever we need to be.

1922
02:15:16,919 --> 02:15:19,867
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, but I want to
fly around to the other side.

1923
02:15:19,867 --> 02:15:24,710
MATT: Okay, so you coast around to this platform
over here and land on the opposite side of the

1924
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:28,759
bridge. The magma rager spins and is flexing in
the direction of where you are.

1925
02:15:28,759 --> 02:15:32,704
TRAVIS: While the Zone of Truth is still active,
Bundle, what are you the most afraid of?

1926
02:15:32,704 --> 02:15:36,451
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1927
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:48,324
TALIESIN: Oh! That's a 24.

1928
02:15:48,324 --> 02:15:49,844
MATT: Answer as you feel.

1929
02:15:49,844 --> 02:15:58,076
TALIESIN: Not you. Not even a little. You're so
soft and squishy.

1930
02:15:58,076 --> 02:16:01,530
TRAVIS: No, see, if it was a spider, then I could
take care of it for you. I don't want to leave you

1931
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:03,133
in an awkward situation.

1932
02:16:03,133 --> 02:16:04,646
JENNIFER: Should we leave you two alone?

1933
02:16:04,646 --> 02:16:05,839
TALIESIN: No.

1934
02:16:05,839 --> 02:16:07,534
MATT: "Yes!"

1935
02:16:07,534 --> 02:16:11,848
TALIESIN: Well, you only live once.

1936
02:16:11,848 --> 02:16:14,118
LAURA: What are you going to do?

1937
02:16:14,118 --> 02:16:16,216
TRAVIS: Do it.

1938
02:16:16,216 --> 02:16:18,323
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for it. Fuck
it.

1939
02:16:18,323 --> 02:16:19,704
MATT: What's your strength?

1940
02:16:19,704 --> 02:16:24,024
TALIESIN: My strength is 16.

1941
02:16:24,024 --> 02:16:31,665
MATT: 16? That's easy enough for you. You run and
leap, big dwarven strong legs. You leap across. You

1942
02:16:31,665 --> 02:16:38,969
land on the center platform, at which point the
magma rager turns to face you. What are you

1943
02:16:38,969 --> 02:16:40,606
doing?

1944
02:16:40,606 --> 02:16:44,919
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Sacred Flame, which I
know will do very little on him, but it might

1945
02:16:44,919 --> 02:16:50,049
temporarily irritate him. I'm going to run the
opposite direction.

1946
02:16:50,049 --> 02:16:54,992
MATT: Okay, Sacred Flame. So he makes a dexterity
saving throw. No, it's an action to do that.

1947
02:16:54,992 --> 02:16:58,137
TALIESIN: Oh, it's an action to do that? Should I
burn my action running?

1948
02:16:58,137 --> 02:17:04,216
MATT: To dash? You can, if you want to. Okay, you
go running as it goes charging toward you. It's

1949
02:17:04,216 --> 02:17:14,751
going to go ahead and attempt to make a
charge-slam attack. That is going to be a 23 to

1950
02:17:14,751 --> 02:17:16,433
hit.

1951
02:17:16,433 --> 02:17:18,266
TALIESIN: Oh my god, yeah, that hits.

1952
02:17:18,266 --> 02:17:21,090
MATT: Double ones on the attack, so only six
points of bludgeoning damage.

1953
02:17:21,090 --> 02:17:22,391
TALIESIN: I can live with that.

1954
02:17:22,391 --> 02:17:23,822
MATT: Six points of fire damage.

1955
02:17:23,822 --> 02:17:25,240
TALIESIN: I can live with that too.

1956
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:30,734
MATT: As it slams into you, you immediately get
pushed 15 feet back into the air. You arc

1957
02:17:30,734 --> 02:17:36,532
backwards. As you're falling back, you can look,
you're edging toward where the central platform

1958
02:17:36,532 --> 02:17:40,356
where you were before you go to the middle one,
and off to the side where the lava is. Go ahead

1959
02:17:40,356 --> 02:17:41,985
and make an acrobatics check.

1960
02:17:41,985 --> 02:17:48,143
TALIESIN: God, if I have to do an action, I hope I
can get an action before this happens. Acrobatics

1961
02:17:48,143 --> 02:17:49,438
check, oh god.

1962
02:17:49,438 --> 02:17:51,181
TRAVIS: Why'd you give the Snitch back?!

1963
02:17:51,181 --> 02:17:52,876
TALIESIN: Because I'm an idiot! 20.

1964
02:17:52,876 --> 02:17:58,757
MATT: 20? You barely manage to catch yourself on
the edge and roll back up (straining) onto the

1965
02:17:58,757 --> 02:18:05,076
platform. The magma rager is right there staring
at you, its burning coal magma eyes angrily

1966
02:18:05,076 --> 02:18:06,865
staring at your dwarven form.

1967
02:18:06,865 --> 02:18:08,653
TALIESIN: So where am I now?

1968
02:18:08,653 --> 02:18:11,729
MATT: You are now currently right here in the
center, yeah.

1969
02:18:11,729 --> 02:18:13,649
LAURA: Oh, he ran backwards?

1970
02:18:13,649 --> 02:18:16,982
MATT: He slammed into him as he ran toward him and
pushed him back onto the middle platform. At least

1971
02:18:16,982 --> 02:18:18,684
he didn't fall in.

1972
02:18:18,684 --> 02:18:25,209
LAURA: Okay, I have an idea. Is he considered
fighting us right now, or is he just staring?

1973
02:18:25,209 --> 02:18:30,800
MATT: I mean, in theory, it can't seemingly do
anything at you from range, so he's waiting for

1974
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:35,502
somebody to come to his platform. If you decide to
then assault him on the middle platform, there'd

1975
02:18:35,502 --> 02:18:38,327
be an initiative roll. But right now it doesn't
seem to have any means of attacking at range.

1976
02:18:38,327 --> 02:18:42,997
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to cast Charm Monster
on the creature.

1977
02:18:42,997 --> 02:18:45,223
MATT: Okay. So this is your 4th-level?

1978
02:18:45,223 --> 02:18:46,501
LAURA: It is.

1979
02:18:46,501 --> 02:18:48,572
MATT: It rolled a four, so it does not succeed.

1980
02:18:48,572 --> 02:18:54,862
LAURA: Woo! You love us! We're really great! Let
us pass!

1981
02:18:54,862 --> 02:19:03,274
MATT: You watch as its intense expression toward
the dwarf slackens and it flexes its shoulders and

1982
02:19:03,274 --> 02:19:08,214
then roils back to the center platform and then
looks over toward you with a nod.

1983
02:19:08,214 --> 02:19:15,729
LAURA: Your mama loves you very much. Your papa's
very proud of you. Come on, you guys.

1984
02:19:15,729 --> 02:19:17,998
TRAVIS: Doesn't seem so scary! Across.

1985
02:19:17,998 --> 02:19:20,947
MATT: All right, so your strength, your strength.
What's your strength?

1986
02:19:20,947 --> 02:19:24,069
JENNIFER: Ah, zero. Or ten, sorry, ten.

1987
02:19:24,069 --> 02:19:26,691
LAURA: Nobody attack him, guys. If anybody touches
him, this is going to break.

1988
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:31,157
MATT: Yeah, so the three of you make it across
fine without any issue. Go ahead and make an

1989
02:19:31,157 --> 02:19:32,996
acrobatics check for me.

1990
02:19:32,996 --> 02:19:35,108
LIAM: 20. Natural 20.

1991
02:19:35,108 --> 02:19:39,941
MATT: I'll let that go for all of them. With a
natural 20, seeing this happen and watching them

1992
02:19:39,941 --> 02:19:45,754
all dart across, you begin to do hand-over-feet,
full-on handspring-style leaping over the

1993
02:19:45,754 --> 02:19:50,624
platforms past the rager. You all make it over to
the side platform, meeting up with your mage

1994
02:19:50,624 --> 02:19:54,055
friend as the magma rager's still sitting there,
resting in the center, looking toward you for some

1995
02:19:54,055 --> 02:19:55,625
sort of an order.

1996
02:19:55,625 --> 02:19:56,744
TRAVIS: I did have Reeksus with me.

1997
02:19:56,744 --> 02:20:05,231
MATT: (screeching) (impact) He's being dragged and
slammed like some horrible, slow-motion yo-yo.

1998
02:20:05,231 --> 02:20:08,608
TALIESIN: I did a quick Cure Wounds back to 41.

1999
02:20:08,608 --> 02:20:10,974
LAURA: Can you talk, magma monster?

2000
02:20:10,974 --> 02:20:19,395
MATT: You hear it emitting some sort of sound, but
it sounds like a heavy bonfire and rocks banging

2001
02:20:19,395 --> 02:20:20,835
together.

2002
02:20:20,835 --> 02:20:28,078
LAURA: You know what friends do? They dance.
Friends dance with each other. We should dance.

2003
02:20:28,078 --> 02:20:33,176
MATT: So as you step up to the edge of the
platform, begin to gnome-dance, the rager--

2004
02:20:33,176 --> 02:20:37,180
LIAM: Is it the Warcraft dancing animation?

2005
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:38,863
LAURA: Yeah.

2006
02:20:38,863 --> 02:20:48,483
MATT: There's this large elemental covered in
armor that's pseudo-getting down with this tiny

2007
02:20:48,483 --> 02:20:53,214
mage gnome on the edge of the platform as the lava
glows from underneath, uplighting him.

2008
02:20:53,214 --> 02:20:57,905
LAURA: I guess we can go, you guys. See you
later.

2009
02:20:57,905 --> 02:21:02,267
MATT: As you walk away, it slowly stops dancing
and goes back to rest in the center of the

2010
02:21:02,267 --> 02:21:07,306
platform. All righty, that was a unique solution.

2011
02:21:07,306 --> 02:21:12,590
TRAVIS: Reeksus, now that your lies are through,
lead the way. Quietly!

2012
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,546
LIAM: We are problem solvers!

2013
02:21:14,546 --> 02:21:19,553
MATT: "Quietly is the key here! Shh!"

2014
02:21:19,553 --> 02:21:24,221
LIAM: Aw, I don't feel bad. Why is that?

2015
02:21:24,221 --> 02:21:29,815
MATT: "Big thing lives ahead!"

2016
02:21:29,815 --> 02:21:33,235
LIAM: Not Toddlewaddle? Something else?

2017
02:21:33,235 --> 02:21:37,533
MATT: "Togwaggle beyond. This is big dragon!"

2018
02:21:37,533 --> 02:21:41,684
LIAM: What did you say?

2019
02:21:41,853 --> 02:21:42,973
MATT: "Dragon!"

2020
02:21:42,973 --> 02:21:53,664
TRAVIS: I have actually not gone up against a
dragon. I just want to put that out there.

2021
02:21:53,664 --> 02:21:56,250
TALIESIN: They're not bad. Well, I mean, I hear
they're not bad.

2022
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:57,994
LAURA: Have you ever seen a dragon in person?

2023
02:21:57,994 --> 02:22:01,021
TALIESIN: No, no. I mean, well, no. Well, no.

2024
02:22:01,021 --> 02:22:03,365
TRAVIS: Reeksus, one dragon? Just one?

2025
02:22:03,365 --> 02:22:05,842
MATT: "One dragon. Not too bad for you, right?"

2026
02:22:05,842 --> 02:22:09,310
LAURA: Have you ever seen a dragon?

2027
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:13,864
JENNIFER: Yes. Well, my grandfather, he told me
tales of them, yes.

2028
02:22:13,864 --> 02:22:16,396
LAURA: Okay.

2029
02:22:16,396 --> 02:22:19,953
JENNIFER: We choose the shadows in the presence of
dragons.

2030
02:22:19,953 --> 02:22:22,706
TRAVIS: Yes, let's stealth for a minute.

2031
02:22:22,706 --> 02:22:32,335
MATT: As you guys press down through the darkened
grade, the heat subsides slightly. You feel the

2032
02:22:32,335 --> 02:22:41,399
breeze now, this pulsing breeze through the
tunnel, rhythmic almost, as you turn into an open

2033
02:22:41,399 --> 02:22:48,953
cavern, a magnificent natural pocket of geodes and
crystals, beautiful blue and green crystals

2034
02:22:48,953 --> 02:22:55,239
refracting patches of luminous fungus into these
faint kaleidoscopes that permeate the entirety of

2035
02:22:55,239 --> 02:23:02,582
this entryway. There's a visible exit across the
chamber and slightly to the left, where you can

2036
02:23:02,582 --> 02:23:13,906
see in the middle is a glittering mass, piles upon
piles of gold coins, punctuated by gems of all

2037
02:23:13,906 --> 02:23:19,307
colors peeking through this hoard. As you enter
and look about, it is more money than any of you

2038
02:23:19,307 --> 02:23:29,342
have ever seen. There atop this mound, you see
lying the gargantuan, curled form of a sleeping

2039
02:23:29,342 --> 02:23:35,056
red dragon, arms crossed, head resting there,
(snoring).

2040
02:23:35,056 --> 02:23:40,652
JENNIFER: Creature hasn't acted in combat yet?

2041
02:23:40,652 --> 02:23:52,317
LIAM: Yeah, but I have to share. Speaking in
accent, but out of game. As a former rogue,

2042
02:23:52,317 --> 02:24:01,050
boo-hoo, this one is asking me if assassinate is
good in this moment to get a special surprise

2043
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:04,800
attack on gargantuan-sized dragon. Yes.

2044
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:06,237
JENNIFER: He doesn't know I'm here.

2045
02:24:06,237 --> 02:24:07,441
MATT: It's true.

2046
02:24:07,441 --> 02:24:10,029
TRAVIS: Is she asking Quazi, or is she asking
Vax?

2047
02:24:10,029 --> 02:24:16,452
LIAM: You would almost definitely hit dragon, but
it would be like taking donut and hitting side of

2048
02:24:16,452 --> 02:24:25,768
Empire State Building. Absolutely you will hit,
absolutely. You will take off half of one scale of

2049
02:24:25,768 --> 02:24:32,676
dragon. I mean, you can do it. This is Dungeons &
Dragons. Do whatever you like, but I'm just

2050
02:24:32,676 --> 02:24:35,504
saying, the game will end in two minutes.

2051
02:24:35,504 --> 02:24:37,546
MATT: Technically, it's Kobolds & Catacombs.

2052
02:24:37,546 --> 02:24:43,082
JENNIFER: Point made.

2053
02:24:43,082 --> 02:24:45,612
LIAM: I <i>am</i> curious to see.

2054
02:24:45,612 --> 02:24:52,037
TRAVIS: It's still sleeping. What else do we see
in this--?

2055
02:24:52,037 --> 02:24:54,290
MATT: Make a perception check.

2056
02:24:54,290 --> 02:24:57,008
TRAVIS: Okay. With advantage still? Blue fungus
still?

2057
02:24:57,008 --> 02:24:58,420
MATT: You do, yeah.

2058
02:24:58,420 --> 02:24:59,991
TALIESIN: You're a fun guy.

2059
02:24:59,991 --> 02:25:01,544
TRAVIS: Thank you, Taliesin. 19.

2060
02:25:01,544 --> 02:25:06,379
MATT: 19. Glancing about, you can see that the
crystals across the room appear to have been

2061
02:25:06,379 --> 02:25:12,183
either naturally grown, or some have been placed
with some sort of faint, magical light behind them

2062
02:25:12,183 --> 02:25:16,914
that, when it refracts, it actually acts as a
light source within the chamber, almost

2063
02:25:16,914 --> 02:25:23,463
intentionally so to make the place prettier.
Looking throughout this large cluster of coins on

2064
02:25:23,463 --> 02:25:30,354
the floor, you can see broken bits of furniture
and decor, things that have been jammed into there

2065
02:25:30,354 --> 02:25:37,800
and bent slightly, like vases and sculptures.
Various pieces of art that are scattered in this

2066
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:45,210
horde. What does catch your eye is there is a
beautiful, jagged-looking dagger with a series of

2067
02:25:45,210 --> 02:25:52,868
red gems across the blade, a chain affixed to its
pommel that is currently resting partially jammed

2068
02:25:52,868 --> 02:25:55,814
underneath one of the hands of the sleeping
dragon.

2069
02:25:55,814 --> 02:25:59,095
LIAM: Tempting, tempting.

2070
02:25:59,095 --> 02:26:03,034
TRAVIS: I bet he's a heavy sleeper.

2071
02:26:03,034 --> 02:26:08,105
LIAM: Yes. If anyone's going to fuck with that
shit, it's going to be you, but it's still a big

2072
02:26:08,105 --> 02:26:09,409
if.

2073
02:26:09,409 --> 02:26:10,534
JENNIFER: I'm in.

2074
02:26:10,534 --> 02:26:11,659
TRAVIS: Yes!

2075
02:26:11,659 --> 02:26:19,754
LIAM: I also have a question about this item that
I'm attuned to. Let's say that this one's not

2076
02:26:19,754 --> 02:26:26,823
crazy enough to grab dagger and we just want to go
by. This says that, if you ever attempt to flee

2077
02:26:26,823 --> 02:26:29,755
from danger, you make wisdom save. Does sneaking
by--?

2078
02:26:29,755 --> 02:26:31,601
MATT: Avoiding is different than fleeing.

2079
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:36,528
LIAM: I just wanted to triple check. Part of me
thinks it would be hilarious to see me rush in,

2080
02:26:36,528 --> 02:26:37,823
but--

2081
02:26:37,823 --> 02:26:41,646
MATT: Oh, believe me, part of me thinks it'd be
hilarious, too. But distinctive; fleeing is

2082
02:26:41,646 --> 02:26:47,137
different. If the dragon were to be awakened and
engage you, it might be a different deal, but

2083
02:26:47,137 --> 02:26:49,286
slaying a sleeping creature is no glory.

2084
02:26:49,286 --> 02:26:50,992
LIAM and MATT: YOLO.

2085
02:26:50,992 --> 02:26:54,110
TRAVIS: Are there any other exits out of this
room?

2086
02:26:54,110 --> 02:26:58,015
MATT: Currently, from what you view, no. The rest
of the chamber appears to be the home to where

2087
02:26:58,015 --> 02:27:01,807
this dragon is. You do not see an exit and it
seems strange that a dragon of this size would

2088
02:27:01,807 --> 02:27:03,260
find its way in or out.

2089
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:08,734
TRAVIS: Not to be a stickler for our contract, but
do we see any candles?

2090
02:27:08,734 --> 02:27:14,484
MATT: Looking around with your perception bit, you
glance around, and you can see there is a trail of

2091
02:27:14,484 --> 02:27:20,831
flecks of wax that lead across the left side of
the chamber into the exit where it goes. So it

2092
02:27:20,831 --> 02:27:24,054
looks like whatever has been transporting the mass
of candles went that direction.

2093
02:27:24,054 --> 02:27:25,854
LAURA: Great, there's the exit.

2094
02:27:25,854 --> 02:27:29,515
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making my way that
direction no matter what.

2095
02:27:29,515 --> 02:27:32,482
LAURA: Sneaking, sneaking. As stealthy as
possible.

2096
02:27:32,482 --> 02:27:34,043
MATT: Who's sneaking first?

2097
02:27:34,043 --> 02:27:35,621
TALIESIN: Sure.

2098
02:27:35,621 --> 02:27:36,957
MATT: Make a stealth check, please.

2099
02:27:36,957 --> 02:27:43,274
TALIESIN: That's all right. 19.

2100
02:27:43,274 --> 02:27:51,126
MATT: As you make your way slowly around the edge
of the chamber, carefully stepping gingerly on

2101
02:27:51,126 --> 02:28:01,735
your dwarven toes, with a sudden snort, it shifts
slightly. As it blows hot air from its nostrils, a

2102
02:28:01,735 --> 02:28:11,947
few coins glitter and come to rest. Stillness.
Your breath is held. Slowly you exhale as it does

2103
02:28:11,947 --> 02:28:15,852
not appear to have disturbed the dragon. You
slowly make your way the rest of the way across

2104
02:28:15,852 --> 02:28:20,252
the chamber and you're now standing at the archway
for the tunnel that extends beyond to the next area.

2105
02:28:20,252 --> 02:28:21,798
Who's next?

2106
02:28:21,798 --> 02:28:28,133
LIAM: I elbow the gnome and lip sync, and I say,
<i>chain</i>.

2107
02:28:28,133 --> 02:28:29,459
LAURA: No, no.

2108
02:28:29,459 --> 02:28:30,542
LIAM: I know.

2109
02:28:30,542 --> 02:28:38,053
LAURA: Don't do it! Okay. Are you going? Okay, I'm
going to try to go.

2110
02:28:38,053 --> 02:28:41,458
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

2111
02:28:41,458 --> 02:28:44,545
LIAM: You all need to go through because, you
know, I'm so big and heavy.

2112
02:28:44,545 --> 02:28:47,424
LAURA: Once you're through, and then she's got to
go last because she's going to try and steal that

2113
02:28:47,424 --> 02:28:48,813
dagger.

2114
02:28:48,813 --> 02:28:52,070
MATT: What'd you roll?

2115
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:53,465
LAURA: 13.

2116
02:28:53,465 --> 02:29:03,400
MATT: 13, okay. As you slowly make your way
through, there's a slight shift to the dragon's

2117
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:12,328
neck position as it turns (snorting). One eye
slightly opens and you watch as the interior

2118
02:29:12,328 --> 02:29:23,467
secondary lid flicks a little bit and a voice,
(grunting). And it instinctually lobs out a jet of

2119
02:29:23,467 --> 02:29:28,656
flame in your direction. I need you to make a
dexterity saving throw, please.

2120
02:29:28,656 --> 02:29:38,365
LAURA: Ten!

2121
02:29:38,365 --> 02:29:40,846
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice.

2122
02:29:40,846 --> 02:29:44,537
MATT: You take 38 points of fire damage.

2123
02:29:44,537 --> 02:29:58,552
LAURA: Well, I'm unconscious! Oh wait, no. Okay,
wait, let me do my math because I have my Mage

2124
02:29:58,552 --> 02:30:04,830
Armor up, which means that my Arcane Ward is
active, which means I have 19 hit points on my

2125
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:06,141
ward.

2126
02:30:06,141 --> 02:30:07,517
MATT: Which it takes those off first. Yes.

2127
02:30:07,517 --> 02:30:14,930
LAURA: Yes, so that means there's, how many? 38
minus 19. So 19 left. So I'm still alive!

2128
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:21,892
MATT: So the dragon, after snorting haphazardly in
a brief moment of being roused from its slumber,

2129
02:30:21,892 --> 02:30:27,293
its dream, it goes back to sleep as the jet of
flame subsides. You look over and see this, what

2130
02:30:27,293 --> 02:30:35,091
once was a tightly- and well-placed-together bun,
is now a singed mat of scraggled gnome hair as the

2131
02:30:35,091 --> 02:30:40,066
mage stands there, covered in soot, little bits of
fire burning off the edge of the cloak-robe.

2132
02:30:40,066 --> 02:30:45,987
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw a Cure Wounds at that
to help with that.

2133
02:30:45,987 --> 02:30:48,314
LAURA: I'm going to stealthily run toward him.

2134
02:30:48,314 --> 02:30:51,802
MATT: You catch up with Bundle as he goes ahead
and heals. Go ahead and roll for that.

2135
02:30:51,802 --> 02:30:55,472
TALIESIN: You get 11 points back to help.

2136
02:30:55,472 --> 02:30:58,277
MATT: All right, who's next?

2137
02:30:58,277 --> 02:31:01,691
TRAVIS: I'll go.

2138
02:31:01,691 --> 02:31:05,916
MATT: Make a stealth check.

2139
02:31:05,916 --> 02:31:08,359
TRAVIS: That's a five.

2140
02:31:08,359 --> 02:31:15,885
MATT: All right. As you follow suit behind your
gnomish friend, <i>clank clank</i>, a couple of

2141
02:31:15,885 --> 02:31:25,578
footfalls hit and you hear how loud it is. You
stop. (snorting) Heck yeah, it's totally sleeping.

2142
02:31:25,578 --> 02:31:35,001
Two more steps. <i>Clang, clang, clang!</i> (snorting)
You hold still. Okay, it's fine. Two more steps.

2143
02:31:35,001 --> 02:31:39,971
Clang, shink! Your foot hits a small pot on the
ground, which breaks and shatters at the impact of

2144
02:31:39,971 --> 02:31:44,964
your armored foot. (grunting and whooshing) Make a
dexterity saving throw.

2145
02:31:44,964 --> 02:31:50,439
TRAVIS: Nope! Five again!

2146
02:31:50,439 --> 02:31:53,749
MATT: Okay.

2147
02:31:53,749 --> 02:31:57,158
TRAVIS: Let the dice hit the floor.

2148
02:31:57,158 --> 02:31:59,977
MATT: 35 points of fire damage.

2149
02:31:59,977 --> 02:32:02,894
LARUA: Oh jeez! Are you alive?

2150
02:32:02,894 --> 02:32:10,237
MATT: As this gout of fire slams into and burns
all of your flesh, it takes all personal strength

2151
02:32:10,237 --> 02:32:13,963
to not scream out in pain as the flames subside.
You're like, (gasping).

2152
02:32:13,963 --> 02:32:16,778
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I--

2153
02:32:16,778 --> 02:32:19,505
MATT: Are you still holding the rope that
connects?

2154
02:32:19,505 --> 02:32:23,564
TRAVIS: Oh, I was, wasn't I? I still had Reek.

2155
02:32:23,564 --> 02:32:28,177
MATT: Yeah, the rope is burned off now. Reeks,
while still bound, doesn't have a tether.

2156
02:32:28,177 --> 02:32:30,277
TRAVIS: Did he get smoked by the fire too?

2157
02:32:30,277 --> 02:32:36,047
MATt: No, because he was a number of feet behind
you. He's like, (gasping). But you can make the

2158
02:32:36,047 --> 02:32:37,499
rest of the way if you would like to.

2159
02:32:37,499 --> 02:32:41,383
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to. And can I Lay on
Hands, dump the rest of my hit point pool into--?

2160
02:32:41,383 --> 02:32:42,613
Okay.

2161
02:32:42,613 --> 02:32:45,913
MATT: And so the three of you are across now. It's
just the two of you and Reeksus.

2162
02:32:45,913 --> 02:32:50,523
LIAM: Okay. So you want to try to tangle with the
devil and try to take this blade?

2163
02:32:50,523 --> 02:32:52,219
JENNIFER: I do, I do.

2164
02:32:52,219 --> 02:33:00,704
LIAM: Hm. And what is the landscape like from
where they are to where we are, here?

2165
02:33:00,704 --> 02:33:07,524
MATT: It looks like most of it is either a small,
maybe eight- to ten-foot-wide walkway with bits of

2166
02:33:07,524 --> 02:33:12,350
furniture and gold that are pressed over there,
and a few small pillars that have nothing resting

2167
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:16,807
on them at the moment, and along the curved wall
where everyone has been stealthing around. The

2168
02:33:16,807 --> 02:33:20,186
rest of the chamber is filled by hoard pile and
the dragon.

2169
02:33:20,186 --> 02:33:27,839
LIAM: Here's what I think. If I fucking move, big
noise, jig is blown. You need me to stay still. So

2170
02:33:27,839 --> 02:33:35,430
you do your thing and if it goes well, you go and
then I go. If things go bad, we all die together.

2171
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:40,018
JENNIFER: Things go bad, can you run while I
distract him with my things going bad?

2172
02:33:40,018 --> 02:33:43,254
LIAM: You know, no promises. We'll see what
happens. Good luck.

2173
02:33:43,254 --> 02:33:49,249
JENNIFER: Here goes nothing.

2174
02:33:49,249 --> 02:33:51,744
MATT: Stealth check.

2175
02:33:51,882 --> 02:34:03,024
LIAM: Stealth, oh. It's a one. Does she have--?
She does not. Does she have what I had?

2176
02:34:03,024 --> 02:34:06,031
MATT: Are you talking about Reliable Talent?
That's a much higher level skill, unfortunately.

2177
02:34:06,031 --> 02:34:07,910
LIAM: Oh, too bad, so sad.

2178
02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:21,261
MATT: So as you approach and grab the base of the
dagger, you slowly climb up the coins and get your

2179
02:34:21,261 --> 02:34:32,159
hand around the hilt. As you tug, it's caught on
something. You're like, no, I don't know if this

2180
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:40,058
is worth it. You pull again. It's caught on
something. Eventually, it comes free. Whew. You

2181
02:34:40,058 --> 02:34:47,039
glance up and watch as this large, yellow eye is
looking right down at you as a deep voice begins

2182
02:34:47,039 --> 02:34:56,906
to vibrate the ground. The coins jangle at the
sheer bass of its intensity. "Might I ask what

2183
02:34:56,906 --> 02:34:58,632
"you're doing?"

2184
02:34:58,632 --> 02:35:03,207
JENNIFER: I thought it was stuck in your hand. I
thought I would help.

2185
02:35:03,207 --> 02:35:12,211
MATT: "Well, allow me to help you." The arms
suddenly reach out and grab as it lifts its torso

2186
02:35:12,211 --> 02:35:15,145
back. Its head retracts as it inhales.

2187
02:35:15,145 --> 02:35:17,786
TALIESIN: Power Word Shield.

2188
02:35:17,786 --> 02:35:22,314
MATT: Okay, so you're using Power Word Shield on
her? Go ahead and roll up for that. You guys are

2189
02:35:22,314 --> 02:35:24,253
over there. What are you doing?

2190
02:35:24,253 --> 02:35:31,091
LIAM: LRJenkins1234!

2191
02:35:31,091 --> 02:35:36,278
MATT: What are you guys doing? This large dragon
is now rearing back. What are you doing?

2192
02:35:36,278 --> 02:35:37,830
LIAM: Running forward.

2193
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:39,901
MATT: I need everyone to roll initiative.

2194
02:35:39,901 --> 02:35:43,498
JENNIFER: 16 temporary hit points? What does that
mean?

2195
02:35:43,498 --> 02:35:47,188
TALIESIN: It means add 16 that you're about to
probably lose.

2196
02:35:47,188 --> 02:35:48,628
LIAM: So you're there.

2197
02:35:48,628 --> 02:35:49,919
JENNIFER: 56, 62, 72.

2198
02:35:49,919 --> 02:35:52,433
LIAM: But this is where you're at isn't it? Or is
that where you're at?

2199
02:35:52,433 --> 02:35:53,819
JENNIFER: No, I'm right here, that's where I'm at.

2200
02:35:53,819 --> 02:35:57,004
LIAM: You shouldn't be there because you can't go
higher than that so now you add 16 <i>to</i> that and

2201
02:35:57,004 --> 02:35:59,504
that's where you are. So 45 add 16.

2202
02:35:59,504 --> 02:36:00,661
JENNIFER: 61.

2203
02:36:00,661 --> 02:36:01,703
LIAM: Yeah.

2204
02:36:01,703 --> 02:36:04,475
MATT: All right so, initiative everyone. 25 to 20?

2205
02:36:04,475 --> 02:36:05,629
LAURA: 20.

2206
02:36:05,629 --> 02:36:08,832
LIAM: 24. Oh shit, that was Vax's voice.

2207
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:11,066
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was!

2208
02:36:11,066 --> 02:36:12,993
TALIESIN: Seven.

2209
02:36:12,993 --> 02:36:14,709
TRAVIS: 19.

2210
02:36:14,709 --> 02:36:17,572
JENNIFER: Do I roll for that?

2211
02:36:17,572 --> 02:36:19,659
MATT: Yeah, you do. Roll initiative.

2212
02:36:19,659 --> 02:36:24,423
JENNIFER: Oh god, four. You're done.

2213
02:36:24,423 --> 02:36:26,666
MATT: Four plus--? What's your initiative modifier
there?

2214
02:36:26,666 --> 02:36:27,962
JENNIFER: Initiative, my initiative is--

2215
02:36:27,962 --> 02:36:29,391
LIAM: Five plus whatever you roll.

2216
02:36:29,391 --> 02:36:33,858
JENNIFER: Nine. It's not going very well is it?

2217
02:36:33,858 --> 02:36:35,797
LAURA: This is going to go very badly.

2218
02:36:35,797 --> 02:36:39,130
MATT: What did you get Bundle?

2219
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:40,450
TALIESIN: Seven.

2220
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:42,177
MATT: Ooh.

2221
02:36:42,177 --> 02:36:46,979
JENNIFER: YOLO?

2222
02:36:46,979 --> 02:36:50,961
LAURA: We have candles to get!

2223
02:36:50,961 --> 02:36:57,963
MATT: So, top of the round is you. Quazirat. Are
you running to meet up with the rest of the party?

2224
02:36:57,963 --> 02:37:05,837
LIAM: <i>Party?</i> I'm running at dragon. Yes. I'm not
running from dragon. Couldn't if I tried now.

2225
02:37:05,837 --> 02:37:08,597
Well, maybe I could.

2226
02:37:08,597 --> 02:37:12,948
MATT: It's a small tunnel that everyone else is
standing at.

2227
02:37:12,948 --> 02:37:16,938
LIAM: Nah, I'm going to dragon. Yeah. First one is
17.

2228
02:37:16,938 --> 02:37:18,271
MATT: Nope!

2229
02:37:18,271 --> 02:37:22,125
LIAM: Of course not. Second one is 25.

2230
02:37:22,125 --> 02:37:23,950
MATT: 25 hits.

2231
02:37:23,950 --> 02:37:31,794
LIAM: Yes, it does. Okay so that is big damage,
16!

2232
02:37:31,794 --> 02:37:37,503
MATT: 16 points of damage as you strike, arching
your Adventurefury Blessed Blade of the Thrill

2233
02:37:37,503 --> 02:37:42,589
Seeker across the chest of the red dragon. It
scrapes through and you see a little trickle of

2234
02:37:42,589 --> 02:37:47,742
blood begin to spill from the little bit of scales
that you carved through. It's still inhaling and

2235
02:37:47,742 --> 02:37:49,653
seems to not even notice your presence.

2236
02:37:49,653 --> 02:37:53,036
LIAM: Oh buddy. Let's go!

2237
02:37:53,036 --> 02:37:56,161
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Greldamine.

2238
02:37:56,161 --> 02:38:00,193
LAURA: I'm going to hide and not fight a dragon.

2239
02:38:00,193 --> 02:38:03,782
MATT: Okay, so you're retreating into the hallway
and hiding?

2240
02:38:03,782 --> 02:38:04,751
LAURA: Yeah!

2241
02:38:04,751 --> 02:38:08,349
MATT: You run deeper into the hallway. Are you
trying to make a hide action?

2242
02:38:08,349 --> 02:38:09,576
LAURA: Sure.

2243
02:38:09,576 --> 02:38:14,661
MATT: Make a stealth check. So you disappear into
the (screaming), into the cavern.

2244
02:38:14,661 --> 02:38:17,346
LAURA: Oh, I didn't stealth very well. Seven.

2245
02:38:17,346 --> 02:38:21,334
MATT: Okay, you feel like you're pretty stealthed.
All right, Lohkor.

2246
02:38:21,334 --> 02:38:27,854
TRAVIS: I run forward with my warhammer and I'm
going to take two attacks and I'm going to dump

2247
02:38:27,854 --> 02:38:30,311
Divine Smite into both of them.

2248
02:38:30,311 --> 02:38:31,408
MATT: Go for it.

2249
02:38:31,408 --> 02:38:35,488
TRAVIS: Smite. 22 for the first one.

2250
02:38:35,488 --> 02:38:36,964
MATT: That hits.

2251
02:38:36,964 --> 02:38:40,264
TRAVIS: And 16 for the second one.

2252
02:38:40,264 --> 02:38:44,150
MATT: Does not hit. So you don't dump the second
one, once you hit you Divine Smite. So you didn't

2253
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:46,097
lose any spells.

2254
02:38:46,097 --> 02:39:02,412
TRAVIS: Okay. 13 plus-- what's Divine Smite? There
it is. 2d8. 25 points of radiant damage.

2255
02:39:02,412 --> 02:39:09,659
MATT: Nice. So as you run forward <i>slam</i>! Your
hammer hits right near the wound that was left by

2256
02:39:09,659 --> 02:39:14,012
your Draenei friend. As it impacts, there's a
flash of radiant energy and you watch as the wound

2257
02:39:14,012 --> 02:39:20,723
opens up ever so slightly more. The dragon's still
(inhales). Your second strike, you go to swing at

2258
02:39:20,723 --> 02:39:27,824
it and it hits the scales and the impact causes
your entire body to shake from the sheer force of

2259
02:39:27,824 --> 02:39:31,383
its armor against your impact. No effect. That
ends your turn?

2260
02:39:31,383 --> 02:39:32,762
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

2261
02:39:32,762 --> 02:39:43,635
MATT: All right. The dragon rears back and
releases an entire burst of fire breath towards

2262
02:39:43,635 --> 02:39:48,542
all of you except for you. You're just out of
range because you ran. Everyone else, make a

2263
02:39:48,542 --> 02:39:50,510
dexterity saving throw, please.

2264
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:55,377
TRAVIS: You have plus two because you're near me.

2265
02:39:55,377 --> 02:39:56,933
LIAM: What did you get, what is that?

2266
02:39:56,933 --> 02:39:58,488
JENNIFER: One.

2267
02:39:58,488 --> 02:40:01,368
LIAM: That's seven plus your dex but it's still
not great.

2268
02:40:01,368 --> 02:40:03,353
TRAVIS: Ten.

2269
02:40:03,353 --> 02:40:06,274
LAURA: Everybody rolled shit.

2270
02:40:06,274 --> 02:40:07,506
LIAM: Not me.

2271
02:40:07,506 --> 02:40:09,099
TRAVIS: You get a plus two, Liam.

2272
02:40:09,099 --> 02:40:13,047
LIAM: That's not bad.

2273
02:40:13,047 --> 02:40:15,326
TRAVIS: What did you roll?

2274
02:40:15,326 --> 02:40:17,192
LIAM: 22 total.

2275
02:40:17,192 --> 02:40:22,683
MATT: Okay. You take 24 points of fire damage.

2276
02:40:22,683 --> 02:40:24,832
LIAM: Ain't no thing but the chicken wing.

2277
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:30,478
MATT: You failed on the save, but you still take
half because of your evasion so you also take 24

2278
02:40:30,478 --> 02:40:32,407
points of fire damage.

2279
02:40:32,407 --> 02:40:33,370
JENNIFER: Okay.

2280
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:37,932
TALIESIN: Thank you for that cold resistance by
the way, that's really cool of you to put on this

2281
02:40:37,932 --> 02:40:38,885
character.

2282
02:40:38,885 --> 02:40:40,178
MATT: Dude, dwarves have frost resistance in
Warcraft, I'm sorry.

2283
02:40:40,178 --> 02:40:41,721
TALIESIN: I know, bring it.

2284
02:40:41,721 --> 02:40:42,931
MATT: What did you roll on your--

2285
02:40:42,931 --> 02:40:43,723
TALIESIN: Ten.

2286
02:40:43,723 --> 02:40:45,070
TRAVIS: Ten here as well.

2287
02:40:45,070 --> 02:40:46,707
MATT: Okay. So you take 48 points of fire damage.

2288
02:40:46,707 --> 02:40:47,714
TALIESIN: I'm out.

2289
02:40:47,714 --> 02:40:48,812
TRAVIS: Me too.

2290
02:40:48,812 --> 02:40:50,160
LAURA: Oh no!

2291
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:59,224
MATT: You watch as both of them fall to the ground
unconscious--

2292
02:40:59,224 --> 02:41:00,769
LAURA: Oh, they're the only two that can bring our
people back!

2293
02:41:00,769 --> 02:41:02,225
TALIESIN: I've got a healing potion.

2294
02:41:02,225 --> 02:41:03,337
LAURA: I do.

2295
02:41:03,337 --> 02:41:05,351
JENNIFER: We still have to kill this beast.

2296
02:41:05,351 --> 02:41:10,018
(laughter and yelling)

2297
02:41:10,018 --> 02:41:16,135
MATT: With your time traveling, as minor as it may
be, when you're facing death in the face here and

2298
02:41:16,135 --> 02:41:18,669
you don't see much of a chance of victory at this
point--

2299
02:41:18,669 --> 02:41:21,020
LIAM: So these two are down?

2300
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:21,998
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2301
02:41:21,998 --> 02:41:25,346
MATT: That ends the dragon's turn. Aerwin, it's
your turn.

2302
02:41:25,346 --> 02:41:28,352
LIAM: Get the hell out of dodge.

2303
02:41:28,352 --> 02:41:30,844
JENNIFER: We have to get them out, we have to get
everyone out.

2304
02:41:30,844 --> 02:41:32,936
LAURA: Tell them you're sorry.

2305
02:41:32,936 --> 02:41:34,443
JENNIFER: Sorry.

2306
02:41:34,443 --> 02:41:39,072
MATT: (laughs) You have two allies currently on
the ground. One that's right next to you which is

2307
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:41,085
your big friend and--

2308
02:41:41,085 --> 02:41:43,301
JENNIFER: I need to help him. What do I have that
can help them?

2309
02:41:43,301 --> 02:41:45,094
MATT: You can try to grab and drag them if you
want to.

2310
02:41:45,094 --> 02:41:46,872
JENNIFER: I'm going to grab and drag them.

2311
02:41:46,872 --> 02:41:51,058
MATT: Okay. You grab them by the scruff of the
neck and begin pulling them across the way towards

2312
02:41:51,058 --> 02:41:59,662
the direction of where they are. The flames as
they pour through barely miss and begin to catch

2313
02:41:59,662 --> 02:42:09,024
fire. You're now inside an old mine shaft and the
archways have wooden supports in the mine shaft

2314
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:13,141
that are starting to catch fire. So you're
dragging him through. You get him right to the

2315
02:42:13,141 --> 02:42:18,833
edge of the cavern using your movement and action
pulling him over there. The dragon's going to take

2316
02:42:18,833 --> 02:42:26,017
one swipe at you as an attack of opportunity. Oh
that is a 13. What's your armor class?

2317
02:42:26,017 --> 02:42:27,014
JENNIFER: 17.

2318
02:42:27,014 --> 02:42:35,307
MATT: One big swipe barely misses you overhead and
you hear the wind over top as you barely duck

2319
02:42:35,307 --> 02:42:39,013
below, drag him through the coin and get him to
the edge of the cavern. That's the end of your

2320
02:42:39,013 --> 02:42:43,318
turn. That's going to bring us to Bundle! Make a
death saving throw please.

2321
02:42:43,318 --> 02:42:45,382
TALIESIN: I'm cool.

2322
02:42:45,382 --> 02:42:47,139
MATT: All right, cool. You're up.

2323
02:42:47,139 --> 02:42:55,562
LIAM: Okay, this is bad. I'm stupid, but not that
stupid so I'm going to run towards these two, to

2324
02:42:55,562 --> 02:43:01,649
dwarf, yes? And use action to cram potion healing
into his mouth. Wake him up.

2325
02:43:01,649 --> 02:43:04,720
MATT: Okay. So you rush out, the dragon's going to
take a swipe at you as an attack of opportunity.

2326
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:06,467
LIAM: Okay.

2327
02:43:06,467 --> 02:43:12,314
MATT: Actually, he already used a reaction on her,
yeah, so he cannot. So you go running, you get up

2328
02:43:12,314 --> 02:43:15,344
to Bundle's body, drag him the rest of the way so
now you have both their bodies at the edge of the

2329
02:43:15,344 --> 02:43:21,374
cavern entrance, the flames starting to curl in
this area. You put a healing potion-- What healing

2330
02:43:21,374 --> 02:43:23,449
potion is it?

2331
02:43:23,449 --> 02:43:26,641
LIAM: This is a potion of healing greater. 4d4
plus four.

2332
02:43:26,641 --> 02:43:28,504
MATT: Okay. 4d4 plus four you heal.

2333
02:43:28,504 --> 02:43:30,509
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four (coughs).

2334
02:43:30,509 --> 02:43:32,373
TRAVIS: Just you, right?

2335
02:43:32,373 --> 02:43:33,567
LAURA: Yeah.

2336
02:43:33,567 --> 02:43:35,149
MATT: Quazirat, that's the end of your turn.

2337
02:43:35,149 --> 02:43:36,841
LIAM: That's the end of turn, yes.

2338
02:43:36,841 --> 02:43:43,471
MATT: All right. That brings us to-- unless
there's anything else you want to do.

2339
02:43:43,471 --> 02:43:52,036
LIAM: That was action. Wait, hold on. I will use
bonus action to do Second Wind on myself.

2340
02:43:52,036 --> 02:43:54,221
MATT: Okay, sorry, didn't mean to cut you off
there, sorry.

2341
02:43:54,221 --> 02:43:56,310
LIAM: No, that's fine. That's three, yes.

2342
02:43:56,310 --> 02:44:02,901
MATT: All right, that brings us to Greldamine?
It's your turn. The rest of your allies come in,

2343
02:44:02,901 --> 02:44:06,977
two of them being dragged in, burned and
unconscious. One of them slowly comes to

2344
02:44:06,977 --> 02:44:10,735
consciousness as the potion is applied and the
dragon is in the room behind roaring now. The

2345
02:44:10,735 --> 02:44:17,737
whole chamber shakes and quakes and you watch as
bits of rock begin to fall in the mine shaft that

2346
02:44:17,737 --> 02:44:19,579
you're in. What are you doing?

2347
02:44:19,579 --> 02:44:21,427
LAURA: Who else is still in the room?

2348
02:44:21,427 --> 02:44:26,459
MATT: All of your allies haven't quite caught up
to you, they're about ten feet away from you, but

2349
02:44:26,459 --> 02:44:28,793
they're coming into the tunnel that you're in.

2350
02:44:28,793 --> 02:44:30,847
LAURA: Ten feet away? He is?

2351
02:44:30,847 --> 02:44:31,794
MATT: Yes.

2352
02:44:31,794 --> 02:44:35,164
LAURA: I'm going to run towards him because he's
still unconscious, he's being dragged, right?

2353
02:44:35,164 --> 02:44:36,125
MATT: Correct.

2354
02:44:36,125 --> 02:44:42,451
LAURA: I'm going to run towards him, ten feet,
give him a greater healing potion, 4d4 plus four.

2355
02:44:42,451 --> 02:44:44,351
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you roll that.

2356
02:44:44,351 --> 02:44:46,129
LAURA: No, you roll it.

2357
02:44:46,129 --> 02:44:48,739
MATT: Whichever, as long as somebody rolls, it's
fine.

2358
02:44:48,739 --> 02:44:57,007
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I can't grab it. Stop it.
This is the slipperiest dice ever. Damn.

2359
02:44:57,007 --> 02:44:59,237
12.

2360
02:44:59,237 --> 02:45:03,455
LAURA: Plus four. 16. And then I'm going to use
the remainder of my movement to run back into the

2361
02:45:03,455 --> 02:45:04,535
tunnel.

2362
02:45:04,535 --> 02:45:08,767
MATT: You go rushing back down the tunnel.
(yelling)

2363
02:45:08,767 --> 02:45:09,927
LAURA: (yelling)

2364
02:45:09,927 --> 02:45:16,573
MATT: That brings us to your turn, Lohkor. You
come to consciousness coughing from the vial of

2365
02:45:16,573 --> 02:45:18,096
healing potion.

2366
02:45:18,096 --> 02:45:21,095
TRAVIS: (yelling) Double dash!

2367
02:45:21,095 --> 02:45:27,315
MATT: Half of your movement to get up. Then you do
the rest of your movement and then dash. You go

2368
02:45:27,315 --> 02:45:34,190
screaming past your gnome friend. You haven't seen
a person in plate move so quickly. That ends your

2369
02:45:34,190 --> 02:45:40,866
turn. It is now the dragon's turn. To your luck,
the breath weapon does not regenerate. The dragon

2370
02:45:40,866 --> 02:45:45,228
is going to take swipes at each of you. That's a
24 versus you.

2371
02:45:45,228 --> 02:45:51,630
LIAM: Only hits a little bit, though.

2372
02:45:51,630 --> 02:45:58,656
MATT: Okay. And then against you. That's a 15.

2373
02:45:58,656 --> 02:45:59,812
JENNIFER: 17.

2374
02:45:59,812 --> 02:46:06,683
MATT: As both claws strike out to slam into both
of you down on the ground, you manage to dive out

2375
02:46:06,683 --> 02:46:11,525
of the way. You feel the impact behind you. You
almost don't get to your feet as you catch. You

2376
02:46:11,525 --> 02:46:14,617
turn around, though, and you see the arms and legs
splayed underneath the dragon claws of your

2377
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,409
Draenei friend, Quazirat.

2378
02:46:17,409 --> 02:46:20,550
LIAM: Everything's going to be fi--

2379
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:25,173
MATT: That is 15 points of slashing damage.

2380
02:46:25,173 --> 02:46:26,687
LIAM: Yes, okay.

2381
02:46:26,687 --> 02:46:29,250
LAURA: Are you still alive?

2382
02:46:29,250 --> 02:46:31,857
LIAM: Yeah, you know, always living.

2383
02:46:31,857 --> 02:46:34,741
MATT: There's no room in here to do a tail attack,
unfortunately. So it can't make that. That ends

2384
02:46:34,741 --> 02:46:36,517
the dragon's turn. Your turn, Jennifer.

2385
02:46:36,517 --> 02:46:39,454
JENNIFER: Okay. So I decide what we're going to
do?

2386
02:46:39,454 --> 02:46:43,490
MATT: All your friends are running out that way.
The dragon seemingly can't get into this size of

2387
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:44,337
the chamber.

2388
02:46:44,337 --> 02:46:45,442
JENNIFER: I'm running.

2389
02:46:45,442 --> 02:46:46,934
MATT: You go bolting out there.

2390
02:46:46,934 --> 02:46:48,371
LAURA: Good thing you got that dagger, though!

2391
02:46:48,371 --> 02:46:49,521
JENNIFER: Yes!

2392
02:46:49,521 --> 02:46:52,717
MATT: You're holding the dagger like, "Yay!"
(yelling) You go running and you catch up to the

2393
02:46:52,717 --> 02:46:59,528
rest of them. You're bolting past the mage. Full
on double dash. You go past your paladin friend.

2394
02:46:59,528 --> 02:47:03,537
That ends your turn. That brings us to Bundle.

2395
02:47:03,537 --> 02:47:06,285
TALIESIN: I'm running. No, I'm out!

2396
02:47:06,285 --> 02:47:11,772
MATT: You go bolting, dwarven legs catching up to
the rest of them. That brings us to the top.

2397
02:47:11,772 --> 02:47:13,025
Quazirat?

2398
02:47:13,025 --> 02:47:17,079
LIAM: I'm going to flee from the dragon.

2399
02:47:17,079 --> 02:47:18,827
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

2400
02:47:18,827 --> 02:47:20,804
LIAM: We'll see how we do!

2401
02:47:20,804 --> 02:47:22,163
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

2402
02:47:22,163 --> 02:47:23,468
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

2403
02:47:23,468 --> 02:47:26,004
LIAM: It's a big 13!

2404
02:47:26,004 --> 02:47:28,323
MATT: Exactly? What's the DC on the sword?

2405
02:47:28,323 --> 02:47:29,692
LIAM: 12.

2406
02:47:29,692 --> 02:47:31,595
MATT: So you succeed!

2407
02:47:31,595 --> 02:47:32,929
LIAM: Let's get the hell out of here, you guys!

2408
02:47:32,929 --> 02:47:39,717
MATT: You resist the magical influence of the YOLO
that's thrown upon you by Adventure--

2409
02:47:39,717 --> 02:47:44,021
LIAM: Blessed Blade of the Thrill Seeker.

2410
02:47:44,021 --> 02:47:46,197
MATT: Adventurefury. Blessed Blade of the Thrill
Seeker.

2411
02:47:46,197 --> 02:47:48,393
LIAM: Eh, too much hassle! Go!

2412
02:47:48,393 --> 02:47:56,685
MATT: I believe he's wielding an adventure sword.
As you guys are bolting behind, rushing as fast as

2413
02:47:56,685 --> 02:48:03,420
you can, you hear the rumbling and the roar of the
dragon and the heavy inhale once more. As the head

2414
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:10,496
begins to push its way into the cavern behind you,
the impact, the cavern shaking, you two who are

2415
02:48:10,496 --> 02:48:16,760
running the fastest notice before anyone else
does, the ground gives out beneath you. You both

2416
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:22,207
go into a freefall as the strength of the ground
dissipates beneath your form. The rest of you see

2417
02:48:22,207 --> 02:48:26,307
this happen just as you reach the edge and you
watch as the tunnel is falling and collapsing

2418
02:48:26,307 --> 02:48:32,477
beneath you as you all begin to tumble down into
darkness. Right as that gout of fire is released,

2419
02:48:32,477 --> 02:48:38,612
you watch above you as you spin into shadow, the
flames completely engulf the cavern where you once

2420
02:48:38,612 --> 02:48:45,802
were. Strangely, the collapse saved you! As you
plummet down, whack! I need everyone to make an

2421
02:48:45,802 --> 02:48:49,526
acrobatics check to see if you can manage to
lessen the impact of the fall.

2422
02:48:49,526 --> 02:48:54,820
LAURA: Natural 20!

2423
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:56,767
TALIESIN: Not a natural 20, but 20.

2424
02:48:56,767 --> 02:48:58,690
MATT: You take four points of bludgeoning damage.

2425
02:48:58,690 --> 02:49:00,253
TRAVIS: 14.

2426
02:49:00,253 --> 02:49:01,903
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

2427
02:49:01,903 --> 02:49:02,847
TALIESIN: 20.

2428
02:49:02,847 --> 02:49:04,223
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

2429
02:49:04,223 --> 02:49:05,370
JENNIFER: 19.

2430
02:49:05,370 --> 02:49:06,608
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage.

2431
02:49:06,608 --> 02:49:07,927
LIAM: 24.

2432
02:49:07,927 --> 02:49:10,206
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage. You guys
all managed to lessen the impact of the fall.

2433
02:49:10,206 --> 02:49:11,803
LAURA: What happened to Reeksus?

2434
02:49:11,803 --> 02:49:18,816
MATT: He is nowhere to be seen. Who knows what his
fate was. Probably very toasty.

2435
02:49:18,816 --> 02:49:22,783
TRAVIS: Can I Cure Wounds on myself?

2436
02:49:22,783 --> 02:49:23,805
MATT: Yeah!

2437
02:49:23,805 --> 02:49:25,321
TRAVIS: Cure Wounds!

2438
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:33,195
MATT: Go for it. By the way, you now have that.

2439
02:49:33,195 --> 02:49:37,159
LIAM: See what you got. Ooh!

2440
02:49:37,159 --> 02:49:39,130
LAURA: Read it out loud!

2441
02:49:39,130 --> 02:49:43,439
JENNIFER: Kingslayer. Dagger. Artifact. Requires
attunement slot. One-handed weapon. Once

2442
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:47,812
commissioned by the orc warlock Gul'dan for his
assassin Garona, this blade has seen many a death

2443
02:49:47,812 --> 02:49:52,473
at its hands. One of a pair, the other has been
lost to time. You gain +3 to all attack and damage

2444
02:49:52,473 --> 02:49:57,695
rolls made with this weapon. When you hit an
enemy, they suffer an extra 1d8 poison damage and

2445
02:49:57,695 --> 02:50:03,181
make constitution save (DC 14) or become poisoned
until the end of your next turn.

2446
02:50:03,181 --> 02:50:04,677
TALIESIN: That's mean!

2447
02:50:04,677 --> 02:50:06,308
LAURA: Attune to that shit!

2448
02:50:06,308 --> 02:50:07,864
JENNIFER: It was hard to get.

2449
02:50:07,864 --> 02:50:09,642
TALIESIN: Worth it!

2450
02:50:09,642 --> 02:50:13,689
LIAM: She needs 20 minutes with that. So we should
probably, you know.

2451
02:50:13,689 --> 02:50:15,079
LAURA: We could rest up.

2452
02:50:15,079 --> 02:50:17,905
TALIESIN: I'll do a Mass Healing Word.

2453
02:50:17,905 --> 02:50:22,547
LAURA: Do you want to? Or we could use our hit
dice. If we take a short rest while she attunes.

2454
02:50:22,547 --> 02:50:25,608
TALIESIN: We could use our hit dice, or I could
do, yeah.

2455
02:50:25,608 --> 02:50:27,826
LAURA: We might need that later.

2456
02:50:27,826 --> 02:50:29,488
TRAVIS: Yeah, do the hit dice.

2457
02:50:29,488 --> 02:50:31,718
MATT: You guys glance around the space you're in.

2458
02:50:31,718 --> 02:50:33,633
LAURA: Oh, yeah. We need to actually do that.

2459
02:50:33,633 --> 02:50:39,619
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you look around. What faint bit of light you carry

2460
02:50:39,619 --> 02:50:42,973
with your torch light or the Light spell to look
around at the space around. You seem to have

2461
02:50:42,973 --> 02:50:49,870
slipped down into a small crevasse that is
partially broken open. You're hidden in this

2462
02:50:49,870 --> 02:50:54,853
small, collapsed portion where a lot of it is
filled with the loose rock. Beyond it, you can see

2463
02:50:54,853 --> 02:51:00,195
a flickering, orange glow. As you approach and
glance up the side, make a perception check,

2464
02:51:00,195 --> 02:51:01,885
whoever is at the front of that.

2465
02:51:01,885 --> 02:51:14,628
TRAVIS: I've got it. Advantage. Blue fungus! That
was crap all around. Nine. Ten.

2466
02:51:14,628 --> 02:51:16,806
LAURA: That's terrible.

2467
02:51:16,806 --> 02:51:26,877
MATT: As you come inside, you see a circular
chamber. More hexagonal, I guess. Stone-built,

2468
02:51:26,877 --> 02:51:31,257
constructed. Most everything else here has been
natural. This has some cavernous feel, but has

2469
02:51:31,257 --> 02:51:39,493
some structure to it. This entire chamber is
filled with knickknacks, gold pieces, random

2470
02:51:39,493 --> 02:51:49,463
boxes, collected odds and ends, and mounds of wax
ending in numerous lit candles. The entire

2471
02:51:49,463 --> 02:51:55,606
chamber: hundreds of lit candles. The most
romantic of chambers you've seen. Large, small.

2472
02:51:55,606 --> 02:52:03,630
This is the mass of where candle storage is for
this subterranean cavern network. That's all

2473
02:52:03,630 --> 02:52:05,403
you're able to make out from this point.

2474
02:52:05,403 --> 02:52:10,114
TRAVIS: Well, there's a shitload of wax ahead.

2475
02:52:10,114 --> 02:52:13,494
LAURA: Should we sit down and heal ourselves?

2476
02:52:13,494 --> 02:52:16,878
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think the coast is clear.

2477
02:52:16,878 --> 02:52:20,602
LAURA: Okay.

2478
02:52:20,602 --> 02:52:31,731
TALIESIN: Actually, I can do a thing that might
help. Where's the thing where I can make it so we

2479
02:52:31,731 --> 02:52:36,611
all get max healing no matter what?

2480
02:52:36,611 --> 02:52:40,146
MATT: That's a 3rd-level spell. That is--

2481
02:52:40,146 --> 02:52:45,013
TALIESIN: Beacon of Hope?

2482
02:52:45,013 --> 02:52:47,504
LAURA: No, I don't think you have it.

2483
02:52:47,504 --> 02:52:58,419
TALIESIN: It's Beacon of Hope. So I'm going to
cast Beacon of Hope on everybody so for the next

2484
02:52:58,419 --> 02:53:04,514
minute, I suppose it's just-- will this work for
hit dice?

2485
02:53:04,514 --> 02:53:06,031
MATT: Not on hit dice, no.

2486
02:53:06,031 --> 02:53:07,050
TALIESIN: Never mind.

2487
02:53:07,050 --> 02:53:10,437
MATT: Beacon of Hope is for spells and effects
that heal you. The hit dice is resting for an

2488
02:53:10,437 --> 02:53:12,742
extended period of time.

2489
02:53:12,742 --> 02:53:16,249
TALIESIN: We'll just do the hit dice. It's been so
long!

2490
02:53:16,249 --> 02:53:19,196
LIAM: Where are you at?

2491
02:53:19,196 --> 02:53:30,561
LAURA: All right!

2492
02:53:30,561 --> 02:53:39,357
TALIESIN: Wow, that was awful.

2493
02:53:39,357 --> 02:53:42,469
LAURA: I'm back, baby!

2494
02:53:42,469 --> 02:53:43,913
TALIESIN: Boy, I'm not.

2495
02:53:43,913 --> 02:53:51,001
MATT: As you guys are completing your short rest,
a new sound perks your ears as you're resting. You

2496
02:53:51,001 --> 02:53:59,845
all stop for a moment and listen. It's the sound
of a soft violin. Echoey. In the direction of

2497
02:53:59,845 --> 02:54:02,189
where the candles are being stored.

2498
02:54:02,189 --> 02:54:03,759
LAURA: Can I peek through the little thing?

2499
02:54:03,759 --> 02:54:06,469
MATT: (violin playing) Make a perception check.

2500
02:54:06,469 --> 02:54:10,165
LIAM: I don't like that music.

2501
02:54:10,165 --> 02:54:11,381
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2502
02:54:11,381 --> 02:54:12,738
LIAM: I don't like it.

2503
02:54:12,738 --> 02:54:15,936
LAURA: 17 plus five is 22.

2504
02:54:15,936 --> 02:54:23,187
MATT: As you come to the edge and you glance past the
first few rows of wax and candle mounds, you can

2505
02:54:23,187 --> 02:54:32,612
see in the distance a number of piles of collected
unlit candles that line the walls. To the back of

2506
02:54:32,612 --> 02:54:40,523
this 30-foot diameter chamber, a large lump wax
throne stands, crowned with a dozen wide candles

2507
02:54:40,523 --> 02:54:48,168
all flickering as they wreathe a sitting, larger,
more rotund than average kobold, wearing leather

2508
02:54:48,168 --> 02:54:52,735
armor that cannot seem to contain his bulging
belly, now freed from the bursting leather plates

2509
02:54:52,735 --> 02:54:59,035
around his torso. A white, wild chinstrap beard
marks his chin line, as a large metallic crown of

2510
02:54:59,035 --> 02:55:06,138
cobbled golds, silvers, and iron adorn his head,
fused with a tall window lantern that shines

2511
02:55:06,138 --> 02:55:12,622
brighter than a lantern should. You see shifting
movement from within the lantern, like the light

2512
02:55:12,622 --> 02:55:20,818
source seems to be moving of its own accord,
almost alive. A smaller, elderly kobold stands

2513
02:55:20,818 --> 02:55:28,812
next to this wax throne with a tiny violin, and
he's playing music as the kobold king sitting on

2514
02:55:28,812 --> 02:55:34,936
the throne has his eyes partially closed,
listening. You see, through the shadows of the

2515
02:55:34,936 --> 02:55:39,996
flickering candlelight, amongst the various piles
beyond your vision, apparently other kobolds are

2516
02:55:39,996 --> 02:55:47,864
also in the chamber rummaging around, moving,
organizing, placing goods they've received. That's

2517
02:55:47,864 --> 02:55:50,071
what you see.

2518
02:55:50,071 --> 02:55:52,007
LAURA: How far away is the throne?

2519
02:55:52,007 --> 02:55:54,354
MATT: It's about 25 feet from you.

2520
02:55:54,354 --> 02:56:02,582
LAURA: (whispering) You guys, the king is right
there! Lots of other dudes in there too.

2521
02:56:02,582 --> 02:56:06,936
TRAVIS: Does the staff have any suggestions?

2522
02:56:06,936 --> 02:56:13,015
LAURA: Hey, Aluneth! Should we attack?

2523
02:56:13,015 --> 02:56:22,383
MATT: "If you feel confident in your power, then
destroy them and siphon their magic. Feed on what

2524
02:56:22,383 --> 02:56:24,132
"power they've got."

2525
02:56:24,132 --> 02:56:25,637
LAURA: Can I do that with you?

2526
02:56:25,637 --> 02:56:27,847
MATT: "Of course, my darling."

2527
02:56:27,847 --> 02:56:30,641
JENNIFER: What's he saying?

2528
02:56:30,641 --> 02:56:34,409
LAURA: Aluneth is saying: destroy them!

2529
02:56:34,409 --> 02:56:36,335
JENNIFER: Can you do that?

2530
02:56:36,335 --> 02:56:37,521
LAURA: I don't know.

2531
02:56:37,521 --> 02:56:39,372
MATT: "Can you do that?"

2532
02:56:39,372 --> 02:56:40,541
LAURA: Yeah!

2533
02:56:40,541 --> 02:56:43,487
MATT: "Then prove that you're worthy of my
gifts."

2534
02:56:43,487 --> 02:56:52,044
LAURA: Yeah! Should I do a Fireball at the king?

2535
02:56:52,044 --> 02:56:54,780
TRAVIS: Who's playing the violin?

2536
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:57,624
LAURA: An old kobold next to him.

2537
02:56:57,624 --> 02:56:59,811
TRAVIS: I thought it was a little gnome?

2538
02:56:59,811 --> 02:57:04,851
MATT: It's a tiny, elderly kobold who's like
(squeaky violin music)

2539
02:57:04,851 --> 02:57:14,246
LIAM: I've seen you two in action. What if she
fires and you follow with fire?

2540
02:57:14,246 --> 02:57:18,400
LAURA: I'll let her do the first attack, because
you get assassinate, and then I'm going to

2541
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:20,692
Fireball immediately after that.

2542
02:57:20,692 --> 02:57:23,045
TALIESIN: And I'll Sacred Flame as well.

2543
02:57:23,045 --> 02:57:32,146
JENNIFER: Am I assassinating the king? Should we
assess first the power of these other kobold

2544
02:57:32,146 --> 02:57:33,476
around him?

2545
02:57:33,476 --> 02:57:34,249
LAURA: Fuck it!

2546
02:57:34,249 --> 02:57:39,554
JENNIFER: All right, let's do it. Eyes on the
prize. Crossbow's ready.

2547
02:57:39,554 --> 02:57:45,190
MATT: Make a stealth check as you approach the
edge and begin to get to a place where you can--

2548
02:57:45,190 --> 02:57:47,552
JENNIFER: 19.

2549
02:57:47,552 --> 02:57:52,887
LIAM: No, it's not, it's much higher. 30.

2550
02:57:52,887 --> 02:58:00,740
MATT: You feel comfortable enough stepping from
the crack in the wall, and then diving below the

2551
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:07,736
first row of large, heavy, wax mounds. You ready
your crossbow across your forearm, aiming it for

2552
02:58:07,736 --> 02:58:15,477
the king's soft under throat. As you prepare
yourself, the music comes to a halt from the

2553
02:58:15,477 --> 02:58:29,813
violinist, and the king turns to him. "Thank you.
This earthquake has made me ever so nervous." Do

2554
02:58:29,813 --> 02:58:33,390
you take your shot? You have advantage on your
attack, so you get to roll twice.

2555
02:58:33,390 --> 02:58:40,845
LIAM: That's cocked. So what's the higher one?

2556
02:58:40,845 --> 02:58:44,708
JENNIFER: 27.

2557
02:58:44,708 --> 02:58:48,044
MATT: That definitely hits, go ahead and roll
damage.

2558
02:58:48,044 --> 02:58:49,911
JENNIFER: That's this one?

2559
02:58:49,911 --> 02:59:01,867
LIAM: You're doing crossbow? 1d6. Roll a cube.
Three plus your sneak attack damage. And we're

2560
02:59:01,867 --> 02:59:06,199
going to double this when you're done, because
you're an assassin hitting in the dark.

2561
02:59:06,199 --> 02:59:08,748
MATT: It is considered a critical hit because he
is unaware.

2562
02:59:08,748 --> 02:59:21,388
LIAM: (counting) 37, because you're an assassin.

2563
02:59:21,388 --> 02:59:23,808
LAURA: Fireball!

2564
02:59:23,808 --> 02:59:32,772
MATT: (choking) It reaches up and turns as you
release the Fireball into the room. The violinist

2565
02:59:32,772 --> 02:59:42,917
starts playing again, looks back and barely pulls
the bow away and goes, "Oh no!" as the entire room

2566
02:59:42,917 --> 02:59:46,435
bursts into flame. Go ahead and roll your 8d6
damage.

2567
02:59:46,435 --> 02:59:48,576
LIAM: Every kobold is the best in this game.

2568
02:59:48,576 --> 03:00:08,173
LAURA: How many? 8d6? Oh jeez. 24.

2569
03:00:08,173 --> 03:00:11,110
MATT: Okay, so 24.

2570
03:00:11,110 --> 03:00:16,687
LAURA: Oh! Plus two! 26, because I'm attacking
with Aluneth.

2571
03:00:16,687 --> 03:00:32,433
MATT: Four of the ten kobolds in the room are
destroyed as the explosion hits. You hear a bunch

2572
03:00:32,433 --> 03:00:37,539
of screams in the corner as a number of them are
annihilated. As you can see, the throne itself is

2573
03:00:37,539 --> 03:00:47,742
melting in the wake of it. King Togwaggle. A three
does not make it. So that's 26 fire damage to him.

2574
03:00:47,742 --> 03:01:01,367
And the violinist is ashes. As the flames subside,
you watch as there's a kobold shaped skeleton

2575
03:01:01,367 --> 03:01:10,572
clutching a now burning violin that tumbles into a
pile on the ground. At which point, the other

2576
03:01:10,572 --> 03:01:15,490
kobolds jump out, damaged and burning looking to
King Togwaggle as he's sitting there, the edges of

2577
03:01:15,490 --> 03:01:22,236
his chin beard burning and curled up. He has this
giant shovel that he has resting at his side. And

2578
03:01:22,236 --> 03:01:34,548
he glances up at his crown and goes "Rakanishu, it
looks like company we has. And You! No! Take!

2579
03:01:34,548 --> 03:01:40,266
"Candle!" Slams the shovel onto the ground and
stands up. Everyone roll initiative.

2580
03:01:40,266 --> 03:01:46,442
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What the hell? What's
Rakanishu?

2581
03:01:46,442 --> 03:02:00,434
MATT: All righty. Wow, okay. So, 25 to 20,
anybody?

2582
03:02:00,434 --> 03:02:01,609
LAURA: 22.

2583
03:02:01,609 --> 03:02:02,753
TALIESIN: 21!

2584
03:02:02,753 --> 03:02:03,900
MATT: Oh wow, look at that!

2585
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:05,059
TALIESIN: It finally happened.

2586
03:02:05,059 --> 03:02:06,508
TRAVIS: "Finally happened."

2587
03:02:06,508 --> 03:02:15,335
MATT: All righty. Then 20 to 15?

2588
03:02:15,335 --> 03:02:16,631
TRAVIS: 18.

2589
03:02:16,631 --> 03:02:21,156
MATT: 15 to ten?

2590
03:02:21,156 --> 03:02:22,630
JENNIFER: 13.

2591
03:02:22,630 --> 03:02:24,412
LIAM: Big ten, my man.

2592
03:02:24,412 --> 03:02:35,544
MATT: All right. Greldamine, you're up first. You
finished shooting the fireball, they're all now

2593
03:02:35,544 --> 03:02:39,705
pulling out pickaxes and going (yelling) and
they're all turning. They can see you and they can

2594
03:02:39,705 --> 03:02:44,991
see you and the rest of you, currently now
stuck in this hole in the wall right now. You're

2595
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:47,149
all locked in this pincered position.

2596
03:02:47,149 --> 03:02:48,596
LIAM: Let's go, wee one.

2597
03:02:48,596 --> 03:02:52,791
LAURA: Okay, ooh. How close are they all to each
other?

2598
03:02:52,791 --> 03:02:55,982
MATT: They're all about 15 feet from each other.

2599
03:02:55,982 --> 03:02:57,966
LAURA: Fireball!

2600
03:02:57,966 --> 03:03:17,334
MATT: All right! Roll the damage. Togwaggle does
make his save this time.

2601
03:03:17,334 --> 03:03:22,735
LAURA: 34.

2602
03:03:22,735 --> 03:03:30,855
MATT: 34, all right. So that's 17 points of fire
damage to Togwaggle. And the rest of the kobolds

2603
03:03:30,855 --> 03:03:34,809
(explosion) (screaming). Annihilated.

2604
03:03:34,809 --> 03:03:36,773
TRAVIS: The one syllable protest!

2605
03:03:36,773 --> 03:03:45,605
MATT: Their pickaxes tumble off and some are stuck
into the stonework. Surrounding, beginning to melt

2606
03:03:45,605 --> 03:03:50,293
wax elements have now melted even further and are
now beginning to coat the ground with soft molten

2607
03:03:50,293 --> 03:03:55,215
wax. The entire chamber is now becoming a sticky
wax base.

2608
03:03:55,215 --> 03:03:58,658
LAURA: Oh. I may have melted all of our loot that
we were supposed to take back.

2609
03:03:58,658 --> 03:04:01,288
LIAM: It'll form back together though.

2610
03:04:01,288 --> 03:04:07,979
LAURA: Yeah, he's getting his wax back, that's the
important part! I am going to back away from the

2611
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:11,403
little crack in the wall and hide against the
wall.

2612
03:04:11,403 --> 03:04:13,424
MATT: So you're now moving out of the crack of the
wall and moving into the chamber?

2613
03:04:13,424 --> 03:04:14,451
LAURA: No.

2614
03:04:14,451 --> 03:04:18,933
MATT: There's a giant, hexagonal, circular
chamber, and the small crack in the wall where you

2615
03:04:18,933 --> 03:04:20,294
guys were hiding.

2616
03:04:20,294 --> 03:04:21,658
LAURA: All of us in this teeny crack?

2617
03:04:21,658 --> 03:04:24,438
MATT: Yes. Except for you, you're actually outside
of it and by one of the mounds that is slowly

2618
03:04:24,438 --> 03:04:25,526
melting in front of you.

2619
03:04:25,526 --> 03:04:31,995
LAURA: Okay, I guess I will step outside of the
crack and try to hide behind a mound of

2620
03:04:31,995 --> 03:04:32,896
something.

2621
03:04:32,896 --> 03:04:35,931
MATT: Okay, so you dart off to one of the mounds.
You don't have any action to do a hide check,

2622
03:04:35,931 --> 03:04:40,254
unfortunately. Using it for cover, hopefully. That
ends your turn. Bundle, you're up.

2623
03:04:40,254 --> 03:04:41,990
LIAM: Everybody say crack as much as you can.

2624
03:04:41,990 --> 03:04:43,715
ALL: Crack!

2625
03:04:43,715 --> 03:04:53,287
TALIESIN: Just for fun, let's do-- where is it? I
keep losing everything I'm doing. I'm going to do a

2626
03:04:53,287 --> 03:05:05,448
very standard Guiding Bolt. And a Sacred Flame
attack. I'm going to go for a two-fer on the big

2627
03:05:05,448 --> 03:05:07,013
kahuna.

2628
03:05:07,013 --> 03:05:08,309
MATT: Those are technically both actions.

2629
03:05:08,309 --> 03:05:19,427
TALIESIN: Oh they're both actions? I thought it
was a bonus, never mind. This is so hard to do,

2630
03:05:19,427 --> 03:05:21,017
it's been so long since I've done this.

2631
03:05:21,017 --> 03:05:23,203
MATT: It's okay. Guiding Bolt?

2632
03:05:23,203 --> 03:05:25,569
LAURA: (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt!

2633
03:05:25,569 --> 03:05:30,554
TALIESIN: I'll do a standard Guiding Bolt at this
guy, and see what happens.

2634
03:05:30,554 --> 03:05:33,033
MATT: Okay. Make a ranged spell attack against
King Togwaggle.

2635
03:05:33,033 --> 03:05:37,867
TALIESIN: Here we go, Guiding Bolt. That's a 19.

2636
03:05:37,867 --> 03:05:39,194
MATT: Plus?

2637
03:05:39,194 --> 03:05:41,510
TALIESIN: Guiding Bolt is a 25.

2638
03:05:41,510 --> 03:05:43,056
MATT: That'll hit, go ahead and roll damage.

2639
03:05:43,056 --> 03:05:55,391
TALIESIN: That's 4d6 radiant. Ooh! 16 points of
radiant damage.

2640
03:05:55,391 --> 03:06:01,544
MATT: Okay, and the next hit against him has
advantage.

2641
03:06:01,544 --> 03:06:08,028
TALIESIN: Yeah, the next hit against him has
advantage, and yeah, I'm going to give myself a

2642
03:06:08,028 --> 03:06:10,982
quick Healing Word as a bonus action because I'm
really low.

2643
03:06:10,982 --> 03:06:18,569
MATT: Okay. As a reaction, King Togwaggle's going
to go ahead and use Vengeance of Rakanishu. After

2644
03:06:18,569 --> 03:06:24,607
the Guiding Bolt slams into King Togwaggle, he
lifts up his giant shovel in his hand and you

2645
03:06:24,607 --> 03:06:30,862
watch as the interior of the lantern crown that he
has begins to brighten and suddenly your chest

2646
03:06:30,862 --> 03:06:42,550
bursts into flame. You suffer 14 points of fire
damage and you are considered on fire. Until you

2647
03:06:42,550 --> 03:06:45,536
spend an action to put it out, you're going to
take 1d6 fire damage every turn.

2648
03:06:45,536 --> 03:06:51,245
TALIESIN: All right. I am at 29 points of health,
that's okay.

2649
03:06:51,245 --> 03:06:52,519
MATT: All righty, so that ends your turn?

2650
03:06:52,519 --> 03:06:53,547
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2651
03:06:53,547 --> 03:06:57,554
MATT: All right, suddenly you watch across the
chamber which you hadn't noticed before, there is

2652
03:06:57,554 --> 03:07:02,281
a door that slams open and from the inside, from
what little of bit you can see it looks like some

2653
03:07:02,281 --> 03:07:13,712
sort of a latrine or like an open piss pot room.
Four kobolds start rushing out into the center of

2654
03:07:13,712 --> 03:07:16,711
the chamber, their feet getting stuck in the wax,
so they'll only be able to move at half their

2655
03:07:16,711 --> 03:07:21,302
speed so they can't get up to anybody. They take
their pickaxes and throw them! So they're going to

2656
03:07:21,302 --> 03:07:29,175
throw three at you and three at you. Technically
you guys would both have a little bit of cover

2657
03:07:29,175 --> 03:07:33,385
because you're behind those, so I'd give a plus
two to your AC for each of you. So the first three

2658
03:07:33,385 --> 03:07:38,722
against you. That is going to be a 16, what's your
armor class?

2659
03:07:38,722 --> 03:07:41,059
LAURA: I did Mage Armor, so I've got 16.

2660
03:07:41,059 --> 03:07:46,941
MATT: Correct, so with the plus two, it does not
hit. The first one is deflected off the armor. Oh,

2661
03:07:46,941 --> 03:07:53,477
that's going to be a natural 19, so that hits you.
You suffer nine points of piercing damage as one

2662
03:07:53,477 --> 03:07:58,233
pickaxe hits you in the chest, clavicle area,
you're like (grunt). The third one's going to

2663
03:07:58,233 --> 03:08:00,518
throw and that is a 19.

2664
03:08:00,518 --> 03:08:05,189
LAURA: That hits.

2665
03:08:05,189 --> 03:08:09,927
MATT: So you take seven points piercing damage
from a second pickaxe that jams you in like the

2666
03:08:09,927 --> 03:08:17,567
hip area, it falls out, but the wound's open. The
three against you. That's going to be a 15 plus

2667
03:08:17,567 --> 03:08:19,034
four, that's 19?

2668
03:08:19,034 --> 03:08:21,148
JENNIFER: I'm 17, I don't have any pluses, right?

2669
03:08:21,148 --> 03:08:22,479
LAURA: Plus two!

2670
03:08:22,479 --> 03:08:23,841
JENNIFER: Okay, so 19.

2671
03:08:23,841 --> 03:08:27,745
MATT: Plus two, so 19, so it hits you exactly. So
you take six points of piercing damage as one

2672
03:08:27,745 --> 03:08:33,374
pickaxe grazes you across the neck and shoulder.
It hurts, you can feel the welt picking up. Second

2673
03:08:33,374 --> 03:08:40,201
one is going to go ahead and strike you, that is
going to be an 11. So, no. That one you dodge out

2674
03:08:40,201 --> 03:08:45,411
of the way, and a third and final one is going to
come for you. That is a natural 20! As you dodge

2675
03:08:45,411 --> 03:08:51,875
out of the way and come around, there is one that
takes both hands (grunt) (whooshing) and as you

2676
03:08:51,875 --> 03:08:59,642
spin around to hear the scream it hits you right
in the forehead. That's a six, that's 12, plus

2677
03:08:59,642 --> 03:09:05,193
three. You take 15 points of piercing damage as
your head is ringing from the impact of the

2678
03:09:05,193 --> 03:09:09,328
pickaxe. Your vision blurs and doubles for a
second as you right yourself and clutch onto the

2679
03:09:09,328 --> 03:09:16,052
soft wax. You fall into a little bit, and pull
yourself out. That's going to end the kobolds'

2680
03:09:16,052 --> 03:09:32,050
turn, now it's King Togwaggle's turn. King
Togwaggle is going to rush forward, currently it's

2681
03:09:32,050 --> 03:09:35,206
only the three of you visible because nobody's
come out of the chamber yet. So he's going to rush

2682
03:09:35,206 --> 03:09:41,536
forward and get between the two of you and make a
shovel strike on each of you. So the first one

2683
03:09:41,536 --> 03:09:43,938
against you, that's a 27.

2684
03:09:43,938 --> 03:09:45,475
LAURA: Oh god!

2685
03:09:45,475 --> 03:09:48,032
MATT: I rolled a natural 19. You take--

2686
03:09:48,032 --> 03:09:54,028
LAURA: He's at disadvantage though, because I'm a
gnome. I'm very small.

2687
03:09:54,028 --> 03:10:03,845
MATT: No. That is 15 points of damage, as the
shovel hits you upside your head, and then

2688
03:10:03,845 --> 03:10:11,651
attacking you. That is a 16 plus eight, that's 24.
That hits you. That's an eight plus six, that's 14

2689
03:10:11,651 --> 03:10:13,453
points of bludgeoning damage.

2690
03:10:13,453 --> 03:10:14,776
TALIESIN: (groans)

2691
03:10:14,776 --> 03:10:19,153
MATT: Ending their turn, it now comes to you.

2692
03:10:19,153 --> 03:10:23,483
TRAVIS: Can I push out of the crevice and run at
King Togwaggle?

2693
03:10:23,483 --> 03:10:27,288
MATT: You push out and he's right there. You guys
are all clustered right on the outside so he's

2694
03:10:27,288 --> 03:10:28,631
easily within range.

2695
03:10:28,631 --> 03:10:29,647
TRAVIS: I can get right on him?

2696
03:10:29,647 --> 03:10:30,613
MATT: Yeah.

2697
03:10:30,613 --> 03:10:33,614
TRAVIS: Can I use my Hammer of Justice, "Target a
creature within 15 feet of you to make a

2698
03:10:33,614 --> 03:10:37,611
"constitution saving throw against your spell save
DC or become stunned until the next round" on my

2699
03:10:37,611 --> 03:10:39,019
next turn?

2700
03:10:39,019 --> 03:10:43,554
MATT: Yes you can. All right, so. That is an 11.
What's your--

2701
03:10:43,554 --> 03:10:44,766
TRAVIS: 13! Yes!

2702
03:10:44,766 --> 03:10:51,859
MATT: So as you step out of the crevice, you
summon the radiant energy granted to you from the

2703
03:10:51,859 --> 03:10:57,762
divine, and you watch as this giant radiant
hammer, summoned from the sky, slams down and

2704
03:10:57,762 --> 03:11:04,412
strikes the top of King Togwaggle's head. The
crown goes off to the side for a second and he's

2705
03:11:04,412 --> 03:11:10,908
like (grunting). He can't make words, his bell is
rung. So he's stunned until the end of your next

2706
03:11:10,908 --> 03:11:11,919
turn.

2707
03:11:11,919 --> 03:11:12,985
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2708
03:11:12,985 --> 03:11:16,776
MATT: All right, that's your action. You're there
and you're up engaged with him. That finishes your

2709
03:11:16,776 --> 03:11:20,511
turn. All right, you're up, Aerwin.

2710
03:11:20,511 --> 03:11:23,485
LAURA: With stunned, if you hit him does it break
the stun? Or he's--

2711
03:11:23,485 --> 03:11:28,201
MATT: No, he's stunned, and attacks against him
have advantage and melee attacks against him I'll

2712
03:11:28,201 --> 03:11:30,466
double check, I'm pretty sure auto-crit.

2713
03:11:30,466 --> 03:11:32,798
TRAVIS: Do I get a bonus action with that crazy
move or is that it?

2714
03:11:32,798 --> 03:11:34,032
MATT: You do, if you want to use a bonus action.

2715
03:11:34,032 --> 03:11:36,836
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to pour some Searing Smite
into it as well.

2716
03:11:36,836 --> 03:11:42,868
MATT: I'll let you do that, sure. Well, it's not
a melee weapon attack, I think, unfortunately.

2717
03:11:42,868 --> 03:11:45,737
TRAVIS: Oh that's right, never mind. That's what
it is, your call.

2718
03:11:45,737 --> 03:11:48,431
MATT: Stunned, incapacitated. Yep, so as an
incapacitated creature, yeah.

2719
03:11:48,431 --> 03:11:50,749
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2720
03:11:50,749 --> 03:11:55,774
LAURA: So you guys, melee attacks are auto-crits on
him right now.

2721
03:11:55,774 --> 03:12:00,466
LIAM: Okay, and your buddy is there so--

2722
03:12:00,466 --> 03:12:03,438
LAURA: Dagger, dagger, dagger!

2723
03:12:03,438 --> 03:12:06,212
LIAM: Not hidden, can't do that, but you're still
going to get sneak attack.

2724
03:12:06,212 --> 03:12:08,587
JENNIFER: Dagger, I want to do the dagger.

2725
03:12:08,587 --> 03:12:15,206
LIAM: Yeah, you're going for an attack. Is she at
advantage because he's stunned and weird?

2726
03:12:15,206 --> 03:12:16,406
MATT: Yes.

2727
03:12:16,406 --> 03:12:18,172
LAURA: It's an auto-crit!

2728
03:12:18,172 --> 03:12:20,333
LIAM: So roll twice. Oh auto-crit, so you don't
even have to roll.

2729
03:12:20,333 --> 03:12:22,014
LAURA: Yeah you do, you have to roll to see if it
hits.

2730
03:12:22,014 --> 03:12:24,282
LIAM: Well, yeah you hit, 16 plus eight, so 24.

2731
03:12:24,282 --> 03:12:28,209
MATT: 24 definitely hits. I'm checking to make
sure I do this right.

2732
03:12:28,209 --> 03:12:30,236
LIAM: So you roll--

2733
03:12:30,236 --> 03:12:32,760
JENNIFER: 1d4?

2734
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:38,133
LIAM: 1d4, which is the triangle, the pyramid.
Roll that. Okay, now you roll your-- four, good.

2735
03:12:38,133 --> 03:12:41,218
Roll these guys. Okay, roll those.

2736
03:12:41,218 --> 03:12:44,521
JENNIFER: Okay, all right.

2737
03:12:44,521 --> 03:12:47,266
LIAM: Holy shit, that's a good sneak attack.

2738
03:12:47,266 --> 03:12:48,981
JENNIFER: 22.

2739
03:12:48,981 --> 03:12:57,514
LIAM: 22, wait, you double it, because it's an
auto-crit, so 22, 44 plus the three, is 47.

2740
03:12:57,514 --> 03:12:59,682
LAURA: Plus the poison damage?

2741
03:12:59,682 --> 03:13:03,838
MATT: Plus a d8, which is doubled because it's an
auto-crit, so roll a d8.

2742
03:13:03,838 --> 03:13:05,502
LIAM: Oh, you have smoked this guy.

2743
03:13:05,502 --> 03:13:07,616
LAURA: Yeah, that one, that one.

2744
03:13:07,616 --> 03:13:09,406
JENNIFER: Five.

2745
03:13:09,406 --> 03:13:10,734
LIAM: Ten.

2746
03:13:10,734 --> 03:13:13,443
57.

2747
03:13:13,647 --> 03:13:17,539
TRAVIS: Jesus, 57 points?

2748
03:13:17,539 --> 03:13:23,832
MATT: So using the dagger you mustered from
beneath the dragon, you jam it right up into the

2749
03:13:23,832 --> 03:13:29,834
abdomen of King Togwaggle and while stunned he
goes (choking) and you watch as some of his brackish

2750
03:13:29,834 --> 03:13:35,157
blood (splattering) out of his mouth. He looks
hurt, but is very angry. While still stunned in

2751
03:13:35,157 --> 03:13:39,107
place, his eyes have locked in on you. You can see
the bloodshot look behind the whites. He goes,

2752
03:13:39,107 --> 03:13:48,005
"No. Take. Candle." Is that your turn?

2753
03:13:48,005 --> 03:13:52,611
JENNIFER: Is that the end of my turn? That's the
end of my turn.

2754
03:13:52,611 --> 03:13:55,813
LIAM: Yes, you can disengage as bonus action and
get away from him so he can't hurt you.

2755
03:13:55,813 --> 03:13:57,429
JENNIFER: I'll do that.

2756
03:13:57,429 --> 03:13:58,175
LIAM: Dance back.

2757
03:13:58,175 --> 03:13:59,472
JENNIFER: I'll dance back.

2758
03:13:59,472 --> 03:14:02,457
MATT: He's stunned, he can't even attack her. So
you move away from him. All right, so you pull

2759
03:14:02,457 --> 03:14:07,080
away, pulling the blade out from the wound which
now is like (dripping sound). Ending your turn,

2760
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:08,192
you're up.

2761
03:14:08,192 --> 03:14:10,641
LIAM: How far away are other little guys from this
one?

2762
03:14:10,641 --> 03:14:13,576
MATT: They're about ten feet behind him, in the
center.

2763
03:14:13,576 --> 03:14:18,785
LIAM: Ten feet behind him? Then I will use my
whirlwind warrior class ability, and I will start

2764
03:14:18,785 --> 03:14:21,421
with the big man and move to his little buddies.

2765
03:14:21,421 --> 03:14:22,417
MATT: Okay.

2766
03:14:22,417 --> 03:14:23,789
LIAM: Okay? So here we go.

2767
03:14:23,789 --> 03:14:28,131
MATT: So as an action you can make an attack
against each creature that you come adjacent to.

2768
03:14:28,131 --> 03:14:36,065
LIAM: So I'll start with him, yeah? So I get two
attacks because of who I am, that is 16? Not

2769
03:14:36,065 --> 03:14:36,823
great.

2770
03:14:36,823 --> 03:14:40,301
MATT: You don't get two attacks of part of this,
you get one attack against each thing you go

2771
03:14:40,301 --> 03:14:41,696
across.

2772
03:14:41,696 --> 03:14:42,632
LIAM: Okay.

2773
03:14:42,632 --> 03:14:44,035
MATT: So you get one attack on him.

2774
03:14:44,035 --> 03:14:45,216
LIAM: So am I at advantage because he's fucked
up?

2775
03:14:45,216 --> 03:14:46,360
MATT: Yes.

2776
03:14:46,360 --> 03:14:50,311
LIAM: Okay good. That's better, that's 24 to hit,
that hits.

2777
03:14:50,311 --> 03:14:51,868
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2778
03:14:51,868 --> 03:14:53,241
LIAM: Okay, here we go again.

2779
03:14:53,241 --> 03:14:56,015
MATT: And I'll say with your movement, moving
through you can hit four of the six kobolds.

2780
03:14:56,015 --> 03:15:03,896
LIAM: Okay great. 14 on this guy. Keep going?

2781
03:15:03,896 --> 03:15:08,838
MATT: So you're shifting on and you watch as
Quazirat suddenly grabs his blade and begins

2782
03:15:08,838 --> 03:15:14,849
spinning in a circle. You guys have to duck out of
the way as he carves into King Togwaggle, carves

2783
03:15:14,849 --> 03:15:18,969
through a bunch of the wax and begins burning into
the center of the chamber and cleaves through,

2784
03:15:18,969 --> 03:15:20,482
hopefully, four of these kobolds.

2785
03:15:20,482 --> 03:15:26,314
LIAM: Ever hear of Baryshnikov? Amateur. Do I roll
for attack on each one?

2786
03:15:26,314 --> 03:15:27,432
MATT: Yes, you do.

2787
03:15:27,432 --> 03:15:32,356
LIAM: Okay, here we go. First one, we get 18.

2788
03:15:32,356 --> 03:15:33,548
MATT: Hits.

2789
03:15:33,548 --> 03:15:38,304
LIAM: Second one, we get natural 20. Third one we
get one.

2790
03:15:38,304 --> 03:15:39,482
MATT: Nope.

2791
03:15:39,482 --> 03:15:43,620
LIAM: Fourth one we get 28.

2792
03:15:43,620 --> 03:15:45,844
MATT: Three of them hit, one of them is a
critical.

2793
03:15:45,844 --> 03:15:51,327
LIAM: Okay, so first one we get 18.

2794
03:15:51,327 --> 03:15:52,514
MATT: 18 damage?

2795
03:15:52,514 --> 03:15:53,720
LIAM: Yeah.

2796
03:15:53,720 --> 03:15:56,516
MATT: The first one you cleave the head off.
(squeal)

2797
03:15:56,516 --> 03:16:02,473
LIAM: Okay, so second one critical so eight, 16,
18, 24.

2798
03:16:02,473 --> 03:16:08,339
MATT: That one, the blade bisects him from hip to
chest and he stumbles forward to the ground in two

2799
03:16:08,339 --> 03:16:09,242
pieces.

2800
03:16:09,242 --> 03:16:11,394
LIAM: Oh buddy. And the last one, 14.

2801
03:16:11,394 --> 03:16:19,607
MATT: 14. That one the blade stops in his body and
he's like (choking) "Why?"

2802
03:16:19,607 --> 03:16:22,631
LIAM: Life comes at you fast.

2803
03:16:22,631 --> 03:16:30,583
MATT: (growling) All right. That ends your turn.

2804
03:16:30,583 --> 03:16:31,983
LIAM: Sure does.

2805
03:16:31,983 --> 03:16:35,390
MATT: All right. Greldamine, your turn.

2806
03:16:35,390 --> 03:16:40,632
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try and take his crown
off his head since he's stunned.

2807
03:16:40,632 --> 03:16:45,163
MATT: Okay, what are you going to do, are you
going to grab and pull it off?

2808
03:16:45,163 --> 03:16:45,887
LAURA: Yeah!

2809
03:16:45,887 --> 03:16:47,069
MATT: Okay.

2810
03:16:47,069 --> 03:16:51,783
LAURA: Oh wait, no! Can I use Mage Hand to do it?
Is that what Mage Hand does?

2811
03:16:51,783 --> 03:16:56,215
MATT: If you want to do that roll an athletics
check. Sorry, not an athletics, an arcana check to

2812
03:16:56,215 --> 03:16:57,970
see if you can manage to pull it off.

2813
03:16:57,970 --> 03:17:04,028
LAURA: 15?

2814
03:17:04,028 --> 03:17:10,480
MATT: 15. You watch as the crown comes off and is
now floating there as you're holding it with the

2815
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:11,853
Mage Hand.

2816
03:17:11,853 --> 03:17:19,070
LAURA: I got his crown! I'm going to run across
the room with the Mage Hand following behind me

2817
03:17:19,070 --> 03:17:24,307
and start trying to bury it in wax on the other
side of the room.

2818
03:17:24,307 --> 03:17:27,676
MATT: Okay. So you're holding it in the air and
trying to dig a hole in the soft wax?

2819
03:17:27,676 --> 03:17:28,627
LAURA: Yeah.

2820
03:17:28,627 --> 03:17:30,830
MATT: That will end your turn, Bundle, you're up.

2821
03:17:30,830 --> 03:17:33,974
TALIESIN: It's going to take an action to put
myself out, I assume.

2822
03:17:33,974 --> 03:17:35,575
MATT: If you want to put yourself out.

2823
03:17:35,575 --> 03:17:36,899
TALIESIN: I would like to put myself out.

2824
03:17:36,899 --> 03:17:39,693
MATT: At top of the round, you do take three
points of fire damage.

2825
03:17:39,693 --> 03:17:41,456
LIAM: Stop, drop and roll.

2826
03:17:41,456 --> 03:17:42,269
TALIESIN: Okay.

2827
03:17:42,269 --> 03:17:44,380
MATT: You spend the round (yelping), putting the
fire out on you.

2828
03:17:44,380 --> 03:17:45,701
TALIESIN: Do I get a bonus action?

2829
03:17:45,701 --> 03:17:46,848
MATT: You do.

2830
03:17:46,848 --> 03:17:50,955
TALIESIN: So for a bonus action I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon at 4th-level, because I think

2831
03:17:50,955 --> 03:17:52,830
that gives me an extra d8 for spiritual weapon.

2832
03:17:52,830 --> 03:17:54,027
MATT: It does, yes.

2833
03:17:54,027 --> 03:17:55,582
TALIESIN: All right, so I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon.

2834
03:17:55,582 --> 03:17:56,775
MATT: And what are you summoning?

2835
03:17:56,775 --> 03:18:02,831
TALIESIN: I basically want to summon what is
basically a big chomping mouse trap.

2836
03:18:02,831 --> 03:18:05,961
MATT: (laughing) All right.

2837
03:18:05,961 --> 03:18:08,117
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a whack at the king's
head with a giant--

2838
03:18:08,117 --> 03:18:13,731
MATT: A divine mouse trap. It's beautifully
carved, from ivory it looks like. The silver

2839
03:18:13,731 --> 03:18:20,372
snapping mechanism, it looks like it was of elven
make. It has filigree on it. As it appears you

2840
03:18:20,372 --> 03:18:25,321
hear this chorus go (angelic singing) as it
prepares itself.

2841
03:18:25,321 --> 03:18:28,374
TALIESIN: I'm going to smack it right into him.
Does it auto-crit, if it hits?

2842
03:18:28,374 --> 03:18:31,815
MATT: It's advantage on the attack and I think
it'll be an auto-crit.

2843
03:18:31,815 --> 03:18:35,945
TALIESIN: Oh, it's also advantage on the attack. I
rolled a 17 plus--

2844
03:18:35,945 --> 03:18:37,833
LAURA: Well you could get a 20.

2845
03:18:37,833 --> 03:18:42,815
TALIESIN: Yeah, 23, but it's an auto-crit anyway.

2846
03:18:42,815 --> 03:18:45,189
LAURA: Isn't it? It's an auto-crit?

2847
03:18:45,189 --> 03:19:00,184
TALIESIN: He's still stunned. So that's 26 points
of damage. (snapping)

2848
03:19:00,184 --> 03:19:10,253
MATT: You watch as it snaps down and more blood
spills out. And you hear the snapping of a bone

2849
03:19:10,253 --> 03:19:17,278
and one eye closes in pain. He's still standing
there and is furiously awaiting his return.

2850
03:19:17,278 --> 03:19:22,047
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a bit, with my
movement. And get a little bit of cover.

2851
03:19:22,047 --> 03:19:33,791
MATT: The four kobolds see you running by with the
crown gliding. They go "No! Rakanishu! Save it!"

2852
03:19:33,791 --> 03:19:49,456
and they all throw all their pickaxes at you. That
is 12? Misses you. First one hits soft wax. Second

2853
03:19:49,456 --> 03:19:51,787
one is a 24.

2854
03:19:51,787 --> 03:19:53,175
LAURA: Oh no!

2855
03:19:53,175 --> 03:19:58,764
MATT: So you take five points of piercing damage.
Make a concentration check.

2856
03:19:58,764 --> 03:20:03,168
LAURA: Oh, what a concentration check for the Mage
Hand? Okay!

2857
03:20:03,168 --> 03:20:11,393
MATT: I'm pretty sure Mage Hand is concentration.
We'll find out real fast here. No, it's not

2858
03:20:11,393 --> 03:20:13,094
concentration, it lasts for a minute.

2859
03:20:13,094 --> 03:20:14,438
LAURA: Okay good!

2860
03:20:14,438 --> 03:20:23,852
MATT: Just lasts for a minute. So that one you
took the damage. Third one, that's going to be a

2861
03:20:23,852 --> 03:20:25,700
17 plus four, that's a 21.

2862
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:26,886
LAURA: Oh no.

2863
03:20:26,886 --> 03:20:31,666
MATT: So you take another four plus three damage.
That's seven points of piercing damage.

2864
03:20:31,666 --> 03:20:34,956
LAURA: I turn and look at it right as it hits me
in the face and knocks me out cold.

2865
03:20:34,956 --> 03:20:36,440
TRAVIS: Oh it does?

2866
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:38,470
LAURA: (screams)

2867
03:20:38,470 --> 03:20:43,277
MATT: You fall to the ground and the axe
(pinging). There's a little trickle of blood down

2868
03:20:43,277 --> 03:20:45,609
your forehead as you hit the soft wax, which does
soften your blow.

2869
03:20:45,609 --> 03:20:47,208
LAURA: Oh, it cracks my glasses.

2870
03:20:47,208 --> 03:20:53,838
MATT: It does, one side is now shattered in a
spiderweb, as the crown clatters to the ground. As

2871
03:20:53,838 --> 03:21:02,368
it does the glass of the lantern breaks. All
right, that's the end of the kobolds' turn. Your

2872
03:21:02,368 --> 03:21:03,337
turn.

2873
03:21:03,337 --> 03:21:04,840
TRAVIS: My turn?

2874
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:05,951
MATT: Yes.

2875
03:21:05,951 --> 03:21:10,952
TRAVIS: Hold real still for me (whoosh). Two big
attacks with the warhammer. I'm going to dump

2876
03:21:10,952 --> 03:21:12,935
Searing Smite into the second one.

2877
03:21:12,935 --> 03:21:16,555
LAURA: Advantage.

2878
03:21:16,555 --> 03:21:19,956
TRAVIS: Oh advantage, that's right. I mean they're
crits, aren't they?

2879
03:21:19,956 --> 03:21:21,516
LAURA: Yeah.

2880
03:21:21,516 --> 03:21:29,643
TRAVIS: So 18 to hit. 12 points of damage on the
first one.

2881
03:21:29,643 --> 03:21:31,011
MATT: All right.

2882
03:21:31,011 --> 03:21:33,162
LAURA: No, it's a crit. Double it.

2883
03:21:33,162 --> 03:21:34,169
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. 24.

2884
03:21:34,169 --> 03:21:36,431
MATT: Whatever the dice was you double.

2885
03:21:36,431 --> 03:21:41,040
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh I'm sorry, right. So 14 plus
five. 19.

2886
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:42,039
MATT: 19, all right.

2887
03:21:42,039 --> 03:21:52,699
TRAVIS: 21. 21 again, and I'm dumping Searing
Smite into it. He does a constitution--

2888
03:21:52,699 --> 03:21:53,659
LAURA: 19.

2889
03:21:53,659 --> 03:21:55,446
TRAVIS: Yeah, sorry, what'd I say?

2890
03:21:55,446 --> 03:21:57,347
LAURA: 19 again, you said 21.

2891
03:21:57,347 --> 03:21:58,696
TRAVIS: Oh damn it. (laughing) Sorry.

2892
03:21:58,696 --> 03:22:00,053
MATT: How do you want to do this?

2893
03:22:00,053 --> 03:22:02,017
(cheering)

2894
03:22:02,017 --> 03:22:08,841
TRAVIS: Stunned, I walk up with the warhammer,
spin it in my hand, and do one, two, with the

2895
03:22:08,841 --> 03:22:13,880
second one arcing up with all that radiant damage.
Coming under his chin, trying to change the way

2896
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:15,385
his pretty face looks.

2897
03:22:15,385 --> 03:22:20,021
MATT: And as you do, frozen in place you see the
neck muscles tensing against the magic, trying

2898
03:22:20,021 --> 03:22:27,083
desperately to fight his way back and as the
hammer swings up, the first hit clanks across the

2899
03:22:27,083 --> 03:22:33,143
jaw, which you see (crunch) break and go slack.
The second strike, as you hit the jaw slams

2900
03:22:33,143 --> 03:22:38,871
upward. You see teeth shatter from the sheer force
of the impact. As the jaw slowly falls slack, both

2901
03:22:38,871 --> 03:22:44,665
eyes are cross eyed, the forehead is pushed
inward, and he gurgles before falling onto his

2902
03:22:44,665 --> 03:22:53,298
back, onto the ground. Unconscious. And bleeding
horribly. All right, that end your turn?

2903
03:22:53,298 --> 03:22:54,680
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2904
03:22:54,680 --> 03:22:58,346
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn you
glance over and you notice the mage is down and

2905
03:22:58,346 --> 03:23:07,128
you watch the shattered lantern-- suddenly flames
are beginning to emerge and swirl. You see all the

2906
03:23:07,128 --> 03:23:11,899
nearby candle wicks that have been slowly burning
away from the heat of the room, the flames are

2907
03:23:11,899 --> 03:23:17,784
almost being drawn from the candles towards this
lantern and this flame that is growing in the

2908
03:23:17,784 --> 03:23:25,553
center. And you see all the kobolds are now going,
"Rakanishu, Rakanishu, Rakanishu." That ends your

2909
03:23:25,553 --> 03:23:27,581
turn. Aerwin, you're up.

2910
03:23:27,581 --> 03:23:33,289
JENNIFER: We need to get to safety for a minute,
and get everybody healed I think.

2911
03:23:33,289 --> 03:23:37,728
MATT: You have two outs here, there latrine room,
and there is the crack where you were in.

2912
03:23:37,728 --> 03:23:39,568
JENNIFER: Latrine room.

2913
03:23:39,568 --> 03:23:41,275
MATT: You go darting for the latrine room?

2914
03:23:41,275 --> 03:23:42,294
JENNIFER: Yep.

2915
03:23:42,294 --> 03:23:46,896
MATT: Okay, so you double dash around, leaping
over the body of King Togwaggle, leaping off of

2916
03:23:46,896 --> 03:23:54,110
the soft wax mound, out of the range of the
kobolds that can get a swipe at you. Dart into the

2917
03:23:54,110 --> 03:24:03,361
open latrine room, and as you dart inside, you see
a makeshift royal restroom, complete with a

2918
03:24:03,361 --> 03:24:09,366
terrible smell you'd expect from a kobold latrine.
There is a rickety wooden commode series, three of

2919
03:24:09,366 --> 03:24:16,456
these nasty looking, supposed to look nice but
aren't really nice at all kobold toilets. Even

2920
03:24:16,456 --> 03:24:21,681
dangerous to sit in, they look like they have
shards of wood and nails, jagged up. There is a

2921
03:24:21,681 --> 03:24:25,045
rushing underground river that vanishes through a
far wall. It looks like it's set up with the bars

2922
03:24:25,045 --> 03:24:27,365
to be almost like a bathing apparatus.

2923
03:24:27,365 --> 03:24:33,367
JENNIFER: (sighs) Man. Rushing river, bathing
apparatus. Can I duck in there to hide?

2924
03:24:33,367 --> 03:24:35,381
MATT: You could certainly try.

2925
03:24:35,381 --> 03:24:37,710
JENNIFER: I'm going to duck in there and hide for
a minute to get out of danger.

2926
03:24:37,710 --> 03:24:41,768
MATT: Okay, so you get into the water and you get
down into the rushing water. It's a pretty strong

2927
03:24:41,768 --> 03:24:42,715
current.

2928
03:24:42,715 --> 03:24:43,893
JENNIFER: All right.

2929
03:24:43,893 --> 03:24:49,009
MATT: So you can hold onto one of the rails
there, that can hold you in place. Okay, so you're

2930
03:24:49,009 --> 03:24:50,596
there, keeping low in the water.

2931
03:24:50,596 --> 03:24:53,596
JENNIFER: Do I have any more rope left? No I used
it. I could tie myself up to rest for a minute?

2932
03:24:53,596 --> 03:24:55,076
No, I'll just sit.

2933
03:24:55,076 --> 03:24:57,088
LIAM: You've got six seconds, that's what your
turn is.

2934
03:24:57,088 --> 03:25:00,472
MATT: All right, that brings us then to Quazirat.

2935
03:25:00,472 --> 03:25:05,980
LIAM: Right I see the little one go down, so I
start hoofing it in that direction and I plant my

2936
03:25:05,980 --> 03:25:15,050
hand right down on her little forehead and I use
Gift of the Naaru. And you get seven hit points of

2937
03:25:15,050 --> 03:25:16,360
life.

2938
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:17,531
LAURA: Yay, I'm alive!

2939
03:25:17,531 --> 03:25:19,328
LIAM: But then I keep running past her as far as I
can go.

2940
03:25:19,328 --> 03:25:24,501
MATT: Okay. So you do that, you rush past, go to
heal her. Two of the kobolds that you struck last

2941
03:25:24,501 --> 03:25:29,053
turn that are in melee range with you swing out
with their reactions to take an attack of

2942
03:25:29,053 --> 03:25:30,370
opportunity.

2943
03:25:30,370 --> 03:25:31,505
LIAM: That's fine.

2944
03:25:31,505 --> 03:25:32,207
MATT: 20?

2945
03:25:32,207 --> 03:25:33,323
LIAM: Sure, that hits.

2946
03:25:33,323 --> 03:25:37,855
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage.
Other one. Oh that's a natural one. He swings

2947
03:25:37,855 --> 03:25:43,506
wide. You rush forward, between the two other
kobolds, intending to get to her, heal her, and

2948
03:25:43,506 --> 03:25:45,324
then continue to run. Which direction?

2949
03:25:45,324 --> 03:25:47,109
LIAM: Towards the latrine.

2950
03:25:47,109 --> 03:25:48,634
MATT: Okay, you go darting towards the latrine.

2951
03:25:48,634 --> 03:25:51,090
LIAM: Which is technically fleeing, so do I need
to make saving throw with sword?

2952
03:25:51,090 --> 03:25:52,109
MATT: You would.

2953
03:25:52,109 --> 03:26:00,659
LIAM: Okay good. No. That's not good. That's a
four. YOLO.

2954
03:26:00,659 --> 03:26:08,375
MATT: Adventurefury: Blessed Blade of the Thrill
Seeker calls to you. And this day, glory must be

2955
03:26:08,375 --> 03:26:11,811
found! YOLO, motherfucker.

2956
03:26:11,811 --> 03:26:13,314
LIAM: Bozhe moi!

2957
03:26:13,314 --> 03:26:14,945
MATT: All righty.

2958
03:26:14,945 --> 03:26:17,040
LIAM: But am I out of movement and I'm stuck where
I am?

2959
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:20,097
MATT: You've healed her and then you spin around,
blade ready, and you're going to fight these

2960
03:26:20,097 --> 03:26:22,535
kobolds and whatever that fire thing is that's
growing.

2961
03:26:22,535 --> 03:26:24,147
LIAM: Yes, I am.

2962
03:26:24,147 --> 03:26:26,150
TRAVIS: Electric guitar in the background. (guitar
solo)

2963
03:26:26,150 --> 03:26:27,991
LIAM: I take the sword. (guitar solo)

2964
03:26:27,991 --> 03:26:36,173
MATT: All right, Greldamine. You come to
consciousness and watch as your friend spins

2965
03:26:36,173 --> 03:26:40,725
around with his giant blade and start laughing in
this face of this-- now you notice, swelling

2966
03:26:40,725 --> 03:26:45,631
elemental entity that is drawing fire from all of
the candles in the room and is growing by the

2967
03:26:45,631 --> 03:26:46,760
moment.

2968
03:26:46,760 --> 03:27:01,889
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to use Frost Nova and try
to target the fire element and the other little

2969
03:27:01,889 --> 03:27:03,671
things that are in the room.

2970
03:27:03,671 --> 03:27:10,463
MATT: Okay, all right. So that's a 20-foot radius.
You can hit all the kobolds. All right, so roll

2971
03:27:10,463 --> 03:27:12,510
3d6 cold damage.

2972
03:27:12,510 --> 03:27:18,279
LAURA: Ooh. 15.

2973
03:27:18,279 --> 03:27:19,877
MATT: 15.

2974
03:27:19,877 --> 03:27:21,997
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw.

2975
03:27:21,997 --> 03:27:27,635
MATT: Sorry about that, microphone. And they have
to make a constitution?

2976
03:27:27,635 --> 03:27:29,021
LAURA: Constitution.

2977
03:27:29,021 --> 03:27:36,178
MATT: For the kobolds, what is the DC on that one?
Your spell DC?

2978
03:27:36,178 --> 03:27:40,385
LAURA: My spell DC is 16. Oh, did it go up? No.

2979
03:27:40,385 --> 03:27:46,655
MATT: No, 16, so that's a failure on the first
one. One kobold freezes to death, locked in place

2980
03:27:46,655 --> 03:27:55,453
as they're frozen solid. That one does succeed.
Next one fails with a one and this Rakanishu fails

2981
03:27:55,453 --> 03:28:03,101
with a six plus-- yeah because it's constitution
he doesn't have-- it's a plus four, so that's ten.

2982
03:28:03,101 --> 03:28:10,654
So you watch, first off, Rakanishu takes double
damage for that. Takes 30 points of cold

2983
03:28:10,654 --> 03:28:16,572
damage being vulnerable to the cold. You watch as
the fire entity (freezing sounds). The flames

2984
03:28:16,572 --> 03:28:20,193
slightly flicker and pull in there, and the ice
that's encased around it seems to create this orb

2985
03:28:20,193 --> 03:28:25,042
or sphere that's holding it in place. The source
of the fire that's drawing towards it seems to be

2986
03:28:25,042 --> 03:28:30,180
temporarily cut off and all but one kobold are all
locked by ice. One seems to break forth (growling

2987
03:28:30,180 --> 03:28:38,533
and snorting) "My candles now!" All right, does
that end your turn or do you-- you can still

2988
03:28:38,533 --> 03:28:39,414
move.

2989
03:28:39,414 --> 03:28:42,140
LAURA: I'm going to move, I'm going to run towards
the latrine.

2990
03:28:42,140 --> 03:28:45,380
MATT: Okay. Half your movement to get up from
prone because you were unconscious. So you can get

2991
03:28:45,380 --> 03:28:50,993
about ten to 12 feet. You rush over, you're about
maybe ten feet away from it. But you're making

2992
03:28:50,993 --> 03:28:52,328
your way as best you can!

2993
03:28:52,328 --> 03:28:53,509
LAURA: Are there any candles around?

2994
03:28:53,509 --> 03:28:55,092
MATT: There are dozens of candles.

2995
03:28:55,092 --> 03:28:55,509
LAURA: Still?

2996
03:28:55,509 --> 03:28:58,452
MATT: Yeah, I mean they seem softer and you can
see clusters of them, but yeah.

2997
03:28:58,452 --> 03:28:59,605
LAURA: Okay.

2998
03:28:59,605 --> 03:29:03,024
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? That brings
us to Bundle.

2999
03:29:03,024 --> 03:29:07,859
TALIESIN: I'm going to Channel Divinity and
quickly throw seven points of healing at

3000
03:29:07,859 --> 03:29:21,384
everybody, and myself. Every little bit helps. I'm
going to, just for fun, take a swing with the

3001
03:29:21,384 --> 03:29:26,785
mousetrap at the giant flame beast to see what
happens.

3002
03:29:26,785 --> 03:29:30,308
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack on that.

3003
03:29:30,308 --> 03:29:33,926
TALIESIN: That's a 14?

3004
03:29:33,926 --> 03:29:37,661
MATT: 14? Unfortunately, as it goes to snap, it
hits the ice that's encased around it and can't

3005
03:29:37,661 --> 03:29:39,441
seem to break past. No effect.

3006
03:29:39,441 --> 03:29:44,224
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn and run to the
latrine. <i>Aye!</i> Then I'm going to turn around and

3007
03:29:44,224 --> 03:29:45,368
run.

3008
03:29:45,368 --> 03:29:48,252
MATT: Okay. So you go and run. You can get into
the doorway of the latrine to avoid the kobolds

3009
03:29:48,252 --> 03:29:51,870
that are still in place from getting an attack of
opportunity. All right cool, so you get there,

3010
03:29:51,870 --> 03:29:55,724
that's the end of your turn. The kobolds now are
there, only one of them can move. He's going to go

3011
03:29:55,724 --> 03:29:59,895
ahead and charge after you, who got back up and
swing at you. It's going to rush up to you, and

3012
03:29:59,895 --> 03:30:01,474
swing with its pickaxe.

3013
03:30:01,474 --> 03:30:10,410
That's going to be a 17 plus four. That's
going to be a 21. You take five points of piercing

3014
03:30:10,410 --> 03:30:12,967
damage. Are you still up?

3015
03:30:12,967 --> 03:30:13,880
LAURA: Yeah.

3016
03:30:13,880 --> 03:30:20,359
MATT: The other two are going to begin throwing
their pickaxes. They have a whole cluster of them

3017
03:30:20,359 --> 03:30:23,795
in their bag, and they're throwing them as best as
they can. One of them's going throw at you, and

3018
03:30:23,795 --> 03:30:34,695
then one more, because one of them died, is going
to throw at you. So against you, that's going to

3019
03:30:34,695 --> 03:30:36,031
be a 14.

3020
03:30:36,031 --> 03:30:37,388
TRAVIS: Misses! Sorry.

3021
03:30:37,388 --> 03:30:43,740
MATT: Against you, that's going to be a 12. You
guys are deflecting the pickaxes in the middle of

3022
03:30:43,740 --> 03:30:47,705
the air. Ending their turn, it is now Rakanishu's
turn.

3023
03:30:47,705 --> 03:30:51,422
LAURA: At least he can't move, you guys.

3024
03:30:51,422 --> 03:31:00,813
MATT: All right, so. Beginning of the round, the
ice breaks. His movement's still zero, so

3025
03:31:00,813 --> 03:31:03,862
Rakanishu cannot move, but you're watching as he
begins to gather the flames again from the nearby

3026
03:31:03,862 --> 03:31:11,042
candles. This is a burning fire elemental entity
made of pure rage and flame, and this flickering

3027
03:31:11,042 --> 03:31:24,170
voice goes, "Free! That foolish kobold knew not
what he had. I will be the new firelord!" And his

3028
03:31:24,170 --> 03:31:29,336
mouth opens, and you watch as all the flames begin
to pull out. All of the candles in the room are

3029
03:31:29,336 --> 03:31:36,723
snuffed as the flames are consumed, and the
elemental begins to grow bigger and bigger. As it

3030
03:31:36,723 --> 03:31:44,996
does so, everyone who's still in the room-- which
is you, you, and you're at the door, and you-- all

3031
03:31:44,996 --> 03:31:48,604
suffer one point of fire damage.

3032
03:31:48,604 --> 03:32:00,814
And then as part of his attack, he's going to use
his explode. (roars) And detonates in the chamber,

3033
03:32:00,814 --> 03:32:05,141
40-foot radius, so that's all of you.

3034
03:32:05,141 --> 03:32:05,945
LIAM: Is that a dex save?

3035
03:32:05,945 --> 03:32:13,757
MATT: Nope. All of you ignite. No immediate
damage, but you're all on fire. At the top of your

3036
03:32:13,757 --> 03:32:18,562
round, you take 1d6 fire damage until you take an
action or something to put the fire out. All

3037
03:32:18,562 --> 03:32:22,795
right, so that's the end of Rakanishu's turn. It's
your turn.

3038
03:32:22,795 --> 03:32:26,238
TRAVIS: (pained noises) I run forward.

3039
03:32:26,238 --> 03:32:29,555
MATT: Top of your turn, you take six points of
fire damage.

3040
03:32:29,555 --> 03:32:41,434
TRAVIS: I run forward with two attacks from my
warhammer against Rakanishu. That is 16?

3041
03:32:41,434 --> 03:32:46,450
MATT: Misses. You swing, and the flames seem to
dodge out of it. You hit air, as it seems to be

3042
03:32:46,450 --> 03:32:51,183
reforming its body to avoid the blows and then
going back into its semi-solid fire form.

3043
03:32:51,183 --> 03:32:52,709
TRAVIS: 23?

3044
03:32:52,709 --> 03:32:53,507
MATT: 23 hits.

3045
03:32:53,507 --> 03:33:11,071
TRAVIS: Ten and I will use my bonus action to dump
Searing Smite into this one. So that's an extra

3046
03:33:11,071 --> 03:33:18,380
five points of what kind of damage? I'm not sure.
I think it's fire.

3047
03:33:18,380 --> 03:33:23,458
MATT: Searing Smite? Yeah, that's fire damage.
That does nothing against a fire elemental.

3048
03:33:23,458 --> 03:33:25,030
TRAVIS: That was so smart!

3049
03:33:25,030 --> 03:33:31,842
MATT: So as the flames consume your hammer and it
hits, it devours the fire from the hammer.

3050
03:33:31,842 --> 03:33:35,013
TRAVIS: Well, cool. Good deal. All right, next!

3051
03:33:35,013 --> 03:33:41,186
MATT: (laughter) You still do weapon damage on top
of it, so roll that.

3052
03:33:41,186 --> 03:33:42,963
TRAVIS: It was ten points.

3053
03:33:42,963 --> 03:33:48,854
MATT: All right. Ten damage there. That ends your
turn. That brings us to you, Aerwin.

3054
03:33:48,854 --> 03:33:53,044
JENNIFER: I'm going to go after it with the
kingslayer. Try to take it out.

3055
03:33:53,044 --> 03:33:56,843
MATT: At the top of your round, because you're on
fire-- technically, you were low in the water.

3056
03:33:56,843 --> 03:34:01,554
Because you were low in the water, the flames,
when they begin to take form on you and begin to

3057
03:34:01,554 --> 03:34:06,430
engulf, you duck low and you would have probably
been unaffected. Water puts out the flames. All

3058
03:34:06,430 --> 03:34:10,980
right, so you let go of the pole, you rush back
into the chamber. You cannot get quite close

3059
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:15,282
enough to hit him with a melee. You could throw
the dagger, if you want to, or shoot it.

3060
03:34:15,282 --> 03:34:19,505
JENNIFER: Oh, with the crossbow? Yes, I'm going to
do the crossbow.

3061
03:34:19,505 --> 03:34:24,473
MATT: Okay, so bolt in. Release it. Fire with the
crossbow.

3062
03:34:24,473 --> 03:34:26,689
LIAM: Is Lohkor adjacent?

3063
03:34:26,689 --> 03:34:28,599
MATT: He is, yes, so you get sneak attack.

3064
03:34:28,599 --> 03:34:32,271
JENNIFER: I'm going to add, because it's the
dagger--

3065
03:34:32,271 --> 03:34:35,030
LIAM: No, you're doing the crossbow, you said. You
can do the dagger.

3066
03:34:35,030 --> 03:34:37,061
JENNIFER: It's the dagger in the crossbow.

3067
03:34:37,061 --> 03:34:41,723
LIAM: You cannot fire it. You can throw the
dagger, or you can fire the crossbow.

3068
03:34:41,723 --> 03:34:47,444
JENNIFER: Throwing the dagger, so 30.

3069
03:34:47,444 --> 03:34:49,229
MATT: 30? That'll hit. Roll damage.

3070
03:34:49,229 --> 03:34:58,443
LIAM: So 1d4. Roll the pyramid, then roll your
four cubes. Add that all up.

3071
03:34:58,443 --> 03:35:07,607
JENNIFER: Eight, 11, 13. 16. Plus poison.

3072
03:35:07,607 --> 03:35:14,894
MATT: No poison damage. The elemental is immune to
poison, unfortunately. It's made of fire; there

3073
03:35:14,894 --> 03:35:20,048
are no veins for the poison to affect. The dagger
slams into the fiery torso, and you see a moment

3074
03:35:20,048 --> 03:35:25,291
of resistance as the blade carves into the flames,
then falls and clatters to the ground below it. It

3075
03:35:25,291 --> 03:35:30,652
seems like it did some damage. But it doesn't seem
to be reacting to the impact.

3076
03:35:30,652 --> 03:35:38,039
JENNIFER: So now, I daggered him. Can I shortsword
him?

3077
03:35:38,039 --> 03:35:40,234
LIAM: No, you can't do another attack. You can use
a bonus action--

3078
03:35:40,234 --> 03:35:41,806
JENNIFER: I'm going to back up.

3079
03:35:41,806 --> 03:35:46,150
MATT: You can dash back into the water, if you
want to. So you go back to the water. Holding on

3080
03:35:46,150 --> 03:35:50,899
there; the water's rushing below you. You can see
the water as it's rushing in, it's disappearing

3081
03:35:50,899 --> 03:35:56,056
into a small opening where the rest of the river
is disappearing towards. That ends your turn. That

3082
03:35:56,056 --> 03:35:57,414
brings us to Bundle.

3083
03:35:57,414 --> 03:36:04,667
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is attack
with the Spiritual Weapon, as my bonus action, so

3084
03:36:04,667 --> 03:36:09,874
that's-- oh, that probably hit. 23.

3085
03:36:09,874 --> 03:36:16,637
MATT: Wait, no. I got the order wrong. Quazirat.
Hold onto that roll.

3086
03:36:16,637 --> 03:36:26,104
LIAM: Okay, so I'm on fire? Fuck it. I run, and I
attack. I shout: For Argus! And I run forward to

3087
03:36:26,104 --> 03:36:31,139
him, and I would like to attack-attack for my
attack, but then also use my recovered action

3088
03:36:31,139 --> 03:36:43,428
surge, so I'll hit this fucker three times. First
one is good. Don't distract me! Is 29.

3089
03:36:43,428 --> 03:36:47,207
MATT: That hits. You take four points of fire
damage.

3090
03:36:47,207 --> 03:36:49,426
LIAM: Fine. Is 17 for the next?

3091
03:36:49,426 --> 03:36:51,066
MATT: That misses.

3092
03:36:51,066 --> 03:36:55,251
LIAM: Okay. And last one-- oh, balls-- is 20.

3093
03:36:55,251 --> 03:37:01,825
MATT: 20 hits, and you suffer ten fire damage from
hitting him. You now see at the size that it's

3094
03:37:01,825 --> 03:37:06,597
gotten, hitting it with a melee attack does fire
damage to you by proximity.

3095
03:37:06,597 --> 03:37:14,361
LIAM: That's good shit, so here we go. First
attack-- oh, that's terrible!-- for ten? Second

3096
03:37:14,361 --> 03:37:20,897
attack that hits is 18, so a total of 28, all
told.

3097
03:37:20,897 --> 03:37:25,316
MATT: 28, all told. Gotcha. Okay, so as you're
slamming into it, the flames are burning your

3098
03:37:25,316 --> 03:37:30,888
skin, and you're wincing, swinging as hard as you
can, a few make purchase into its body, and you

3099
03:37:30,888 --> 03:37:35,880
can see it carving away. It reacts a bit from the
hits, but the giant jack-o-lantern fire grin

3100
03:37:35,880 --> 03:37:38,438
continues to swell and grow with its physical
size.

3101
03:37:38,438 --> 03:37:40,851
LIAM: It's all right. I hold my ground and block
my friends.

3102
03:37:40,851 --> 03:37:47,272
MATT: Okay, ending that, now it comes to top of
the round. Your turn.

3103
03:37:47,272 --> 03:37:48,827
LAURA: Are there any more kobolds alive?

3104
03:37:48,827 --> 03:37:58,878
MATT: There are three of them. Actually, yes.
There are three of them, but they're on fire. It

3105
03:37:58,878 --> 03:38:04,542
didn't distinguish. Everything caught fire in the
room, and there are three kobolds going, (pained

3106
03:38:04,542 --> 03:38:08,927
noises) as they're burning up. Rakanishu don't
give a shit.

3107
03:38:08,927 --> 03:38:22,994
LAURA: Okay, well, I'm going to cast Sleep at
2nd-level, so that gives me 7d8 worth of hit dice

3108
03:38:22,994 --> 03:38:24,182
to knock people out.

3109
03:38:24,182 --> 03:38:25,519
MATT: Okay, roll that.

3110
03:38:25,519 --> 03:38:29,140
TRAVIS: Whoa. Sleep.

3111
03:38:29,140 --> 03:38:43,754
LAURA: I'm thinking they're d6, but they're not.
(counting)

3112
03:38:43,754 --> 03:38:48,495
LIAM: Don't act surprised, Travis. We know you're
going to be a Sleep magician in the next

3113
03:38:48,495 --> 03:38:49,833
campaign.

3114
03:38:49,833 --> 03:38:51,995
LAURA: 34.

3115
03:38:51,995 --> 03:39:03,630
MATT: 34? Okay. You watch as the three screaming
kobolds (screaming, snoring). Smoldering as they

3116
03:39:03,630 --> 03:39:07,813
sleep on the ground. On fire. Really tired.

3117
03:39:07,813 --> 03:39:12,641
LAURA: For my movement, I'm going to run towards
the latrine.

3118
03:39:12,641 --> 03:39:14,277
MATT: You're still on fire, right?

3119
03:39:14,277 --> 03:39:15,458
LAURA: Yeah, and jump in the water.

3120
03:39:15,458 --> 03:39:17,290
MATT: You took four fire damage at the top of the
round.

3121
03:39:17,290 --> 03:39:20,044
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to jump in the water to
put myself out.

3122
03:39:20,044 --> 03:39:22,616
MATT: The flames go out as you dive into the
water.

3123
03:39:22,616 --> 03:39:26,362
LIAM: They look so innocent when they're asleep
and on fire.

3124
03:39:26,362 --> 03:39:30,354
MATT: Bundle, now it's your turn. Sorry. You can
still take that attack if you want to.

3125
03:39:30,354 --> 03:39:33,138
TALIESIN: 23 with the Spiritual Weapon to hit.

3126
03:39:33,138 --> 03:39:37,565
MATT: Top of the turn, you still take six points
of fire damage, as you're burning.

3127
03:39:37,565 --> 03:39:47,847
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine. Let's hit this
thing with the mousetrap again. Plus my spell

3128
03:39:47,847 --> 03:39:50,320
attack bonus, so it's 16 points of damage.

3129
03:39:50,320 --> 03:39:56,130
MATT: 16 points of damage. As the giant divine
trap snaps on, you watch as it snaps through one

3130
03:39:56,130 --> 03:40:01,329
of the arms. The fire arm vanishes, as it seems to
sever it at the shoulder, then it reforms

3131
03:40:01,329 --> 03:40:02,912
afterward.

3132
03:40:02,912 --> 03:40:14,006
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to use my second Channel
Divinity: Preserve Life and put 30 points of

3133
03:40:14,006 --> 03:40:21,279
health into you to keep you awake, and I'm going
to take five for myself, then I'm going to run

3134
03:40:21,279 --> 03:40:23,054
into the latrine, as well.

3135
03:40:23,054 --> 03:40:27,705
MATT: Okay, so you dart into the latrine. You go
into the water. You manage to put the flames out

3136
03:40:27,705 --> 03:40:31,098
on you, and now you have three of you sitting in
there. There's enough room for maybe four of you

3137
03:40:31,098 --> 03:40:36,593
into this rushing-water area. All right, so you've
mostly clustered there. That ends your turn. The

3138
03:40:36,593 --> 03:40:47,005
kobolds that are sleeping, it's their turn.
(laughs) They all quietly expire as they smolder

3139
03:40:47,005 --> 03:40:48,535
in their sleep.

3140
03:40:48,535 --> 03:40:52,981
TALIESIN: Live by the candle, die by the candle.

3141
03:40:52,981 --> 03:41:02,890
MATT: And they are. They are their own candle.
Okay, so that finishes their turn. There are no

3142
03:41:02,890 --> 03:41:08,545
more kobolds in this chamber. Rakanishu is now
going to--

3143
03:41:08,545 --> 03:41:11,684
LIAM: I'm in his grill.

3144
03:41:11,684 --> 03:41:21,317
MATT: Both of you are. He's going to focus on you.
He's going to take two fire rakes at you. That is

3145
03:41:21,317 --> 03:41:24,105
26 to hit and 25 to hit.

3146
03:41:24,105 --> 03:41:26,108
LIAM: That almost doesn't hit, but it does.

3147
03:41:26,108 --> 03:41:31,838
MATT: You take 18 points of fire damage from the
first hit.

3148
03:41:31,838 --> 03:41:33,182
LIAM: Totally cool.

3149
03:41:33,182 --> 03:41:36,705
MATT: That's 21 points of fire damage from the
second hit.

3150
03:41:36,705 --> 03:41:51,457
LIAM: So 18 and 21? Cool. Let's find out what that
does. I'm not down, but-- okay, cool. I'm up.

3151
03:41:51,457 --> 03:41:58,898
MATT: Actually, technically? Sorry, those should
be an additional d6, because every round that he

3152
03:41:58,898 --> 03:42:04,709
consumes fire, he increases the damage he deals,
so an additional seven points of fire damage. All

3153
03:42:04,709 --> 03:42:09,130
right, cool. That brings us to the end of
Rakanishu's turn, who is going to begin shifting,

3154
03:42:09,130 --> 03:42:13,856
using the movement, which gives you guys both an
attack of opportunity. Is now moving towards the

3155
03:42:13,856 --> 03:42:17,362
latrine, where everyone's rushing towards. Both of
you guys get attacks of opportunity.

3156
03:42:17,362 --> 03:42:22,261
LIAM: 15.

3157
03:42:22,261 --> 03:42:24,299
TRAVIS: Jesus! Nope.

3158
03:42:24,299 --> 03:42:28,040
MATT: Both of you guys-- he's too fast, and both
of you swing your weapons and actually hit in the

3159
03:42:28,040 --> 03:42:35,518
middle of the air, and there's a spark, and you
both "Damn it!" at each other. Up to the top. That

3160
03:42:35,518 --> 03:42:41,440
brings us to Lohkor. Your turn.

3161
03:42:41,440 --> 03:42:42,882
LAURA: Lohkor.

3162
03:42:42,882 --> 03:42:45,272
TRAVIS: Oh, me! I run up behind and I hit it!

3163
03:42:45,272 --> 03:42:47,159
MATT: Go for it.

3164
03:42:47,159 --> 03:42:50,511
TRAVIS: 20!

3165
03:42:50,511 --> 03:42:53,421
MATT: Hits. You take three points of fire damage.

3166
03:42:53,421 --> 03:43:08,192
TRAVIS: Yay. I rolled the wrong thing. Six points
of damage. Second one. 16.

3167
03:43:08,192 --> 03:43:10,919
MATT: 16 misses. It goes wide.

3168
03:43:10,919 --> 03:43:14,359
TRAVIS: There you go. Cool. That's it.

3169
03:43:14,359 --> 03:43:18,549
MATT: All right, so you rush up and you're behind,
swinging. One hits, one misses. The heat is

3170
03:43:18,549 --> 03:43:22,960
intense now, and whatever facial hair you had is
now gone. Your hairline is beginning to burn away.

3171
03:43:22,960 --> 03:43:27,781
The hairs on your head are being singed off by
being this close to the beast. All right, that's

3172
03:43:27,781 --> 03:43:30,713
going to bring us to Aerwin, your turn.

3173
03:43:30,713 --> 03:43:33,019
JENNIFER: I need to get my dagger back. I'm going
to get my dagger back.

3174
03:43:33,019 --> 03:43:36,372
LIAM: Oh, you're picking it up instead of
attacking? That's your call.

3175
03:43:36,372 --> 03:43:40,923
JENNIFER: No, I want to attack. I want to attack!
I'm going to use the crossbow, because that's what

3176
03:43:40,923 --> 03:43:42,203
I have.

3177
03:43:42,203 --> 03:43:43,392
MATT: All right, roll for an attack.

3178
03:43:43,392 --> 03:43:48,022
LIAM: Plus, what is it, seven?

3179
03:43:48,022 --> 03:43:50,442
JENNIFER: Seven. 15.

3180
03:43:50,442 --> 03:43:54,883
MATT: 15? You go to strike, and it barely misses
it by a couple of inches and fires off into the

3181
03:43:54,883 --> 03:43:56,460
distant room, unfortunately.

3182
03:43:56,460 --> 03:43:59,777
JENNIFER: He's coming toward the latrine?

3183
03:43:59,777 --> 03:44:01,232
MATT: He's coming in that direction, yeah.

3184
03:44:01,232 --> 03:44:03,817
JENNIFER: I'm going to go around him to the other
side to prepare to come after him again.

3185
03:44:03,817 --> 03:44:05,942
MATT: Still inside the latrine?

3186
03:44:05,942 --> 03:44:09,735
JENNIFER: I'm not in the latrine. I came out of
the latrine to attack him.

3187
03:44:09,735 --> 03:44:11,507
MATT: I thought you backed back into it, into the
water.

3188
03:44:11,507 --> 03:44:15,119
JENNIFER: End of the last turn, I went back in,
right?

3189
03:44:15,119 --> 03:44:16,829
MATT: You threw it, then went back in.

3190
03:44:16,829 --> 03:44:20,095
JENNIFER: I didn't have to come out to crossbow
him, did I?

3191
03:44:20,095 --> 03:44:21,263
MATT: Not necessarily.

3192
03:44:21,263 --> 03:44:24,747
JENNIFER: I came out to crossbow him, and then can
I run across the chamber?

3193
03:44:24,747 --> 03:44:29,218
MATT: Sure, I'll let you do that. As you move past
him, he does get an attack of opportunity on you.

3194
03:44:29,218 --> 03:44:40,056
That's going to be a 23 to hit. That is 15 points
of fire damage to you as you run past.

3195
03:44:40,056 --> 03:44:44,415
LAURA: Oh no, unconscious?

3196
03:44:44,415 --> 03:44:46,484
LIAM: No, she's up.

3197
03:44:46,484 --> 03:44:49,836
MATT: That ends your turn. Quazirat, you're up.

3198
03:44:49,836 --> 03:44:57,350
LIAM: I think of my father, Leeron Jenkins, and I
run.

3199
03:44:57,350 --> 03:45:01,316
MATT: I like Leeron Jenkins. Offshoot bloodline.

3200
03:45:01,316 --> 03:45:10,443
LIAM: I run at him, and I attack again. Yeah,
okay. First attack is okay. It's 22.

3201
03:45:10,443 --> 03:45:11,842
MATT: That hits.

3202
03:45:11,842 --> 03:45:16,656
LIAM: Second attack is a 21.

3203
03:45:16,656 --> 03:45:17,618
MATT: Both hit.

3204
03:45:17,618 --> 03:45:25,961
LIAM: Okay, first time, we get 18. Next one, 16.

3205
03:45:25,961 --> 03:45:31,663
MATT: Okay, 18 and 16. All right. You also suffer
nine points of fire damage from the two strikes,

3206
03:45:31,663 --> 03:45:34,867
the flames beating into your face each time you
hit him.

3207
03:45:34,867 --> 03:45:36,615
LIAM: That is so cool.

3208
03:45:36,615 --> 03:45:40,260
MATT: All right, is that the end of your turn?

3209
03:45:40,260 --> 03:45:43,449
LIAM: Yes, it is. Still up.

3210
03:45:43,449 --> 03:45:50,911
MATT: Nice. Yeah, it looks like it's taken a
beating, but it's not looking super rough.

3211
03:45:50,911 --> 03:45:53,541
LIAM: Next round, for sure.

3212
03:45:53,541 --> 03:45:56,354
MATT: Now, your turn. Greldamine.

3213
03:45:56,354 --> 03:45:59,201
LAURA: With my magic wand of missiles--

3214
03:45:59,201 --> 03:46:04,002
LIAM: Sorry! I have a bonus action. I'm going to
use my Second Wind. Thank you. Go.

3215
03:46:04,002 --> 03:46:05,395
MATT: How many times can you use Second Wind?

3216
03:46:05,395 --> 03:46:09,375
LIAM: I recovered it. I used it once before, we
took a short rest, and this is the last time.

3217
03:46:09,375 --> 03:46:12,775
LAURA: With my magic wand of missiles, can I use
all my charges?

3218
03:46:12,775 --> 03:46:14,291
MATT: Sure.

3219
03:46:14,291 --> 03:46:24,656
LAURA: I'm going to use all seven charges in the
magic wand of missiles, and I'm going to try to

3220
03:46:24,656 --> 03:46:25,788
hit it.

3221
03:46:25,788 --> 03:46:30,074
MATT: All right, so that would technically be a
7th-level Magic Missile, which means you'd shoot

3222
03:46:30,074 --> 03:46:34,250
nine darts, so 9d4 plus nine.

3223
03:46:34,250 --> 03:46:36,767
TRAVIS: 9d4?

3224
03:46:36,767 --> 03:46:56,459
LAURA: (counting) 20.

3225
03:46:56,459 --> 03:46:57,808
TRAVIS: Uno mas.

3226
03:46:57,808 --> 03:47:01,436
LAURA: One more? 21 plus--

3227
03:47:01,436 --> 03:47:01,936
MATT: Nine.

3228
03:47:01,936 --> 03:47:03,398
LAURA: Plus nine?

3229
03:47:03,398 --> 03:47:10,128
MATT: 30 points of force damage. As you hold the
wand out in front of you, full-on anime missile

3230
03:47:10,128 --> 03:47:18,326
style, nine magic arcane missiles slam into
Rakanishu. As the impacts hit, Aluneth, in the

3231
03:47:18,326 --> 03:47:25,276
back of your mind, goes, "Yes, that's what I'm
talking about!" Awesome. And you're going to stay

3232
03:47:25,276 --> 03:47:26,470
in the water?

3233
03:47:26,470 --> 03:47:27,442
LAURA: Heck yeah!

3234
03:47:27,442 --> 03:47:30,444
MATT: All right. That's going to end your turn.
Bundle, you're up.

3235
03:47:30,444 --> 03:47:33,918
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians at
level three.

3236
03:47:33,918 --> 03:47:36,260
MATT: Spirit Guardians is still up, isn't it,
though?

3237
03:47:36,260 --> 03:47:40,570
TALIESIN: Spirit Guardians is different. You're
thinking of Spiritual Weapon. This is Spirit

3238
03:47:40,570 --> 03:47:46,931
Guardians, so if he's within 15 feet of me, that's
going to be a thing on his turn, if he's within 15

3239
03:47:46,931 --> 03:47:53,018
feet. Also, he's slowed by half. But I'm also
going to hit him with my Spiritual Weapon.

3240
03:47:53,018 --> 03:48:00,195
Mousetrap! Goddamn it. I miss. Can I have my die
back?

3241
03:48:00,195 --> 03:48:06,337
MATT: Nope. It's mine now. All right, that ends
your turn. It is now Rakanishu's turn. The flames

3242
03:48:06,337 --> 03:48:15,327
continue to swell even larger, and now there is a
flaming radius. Fire is now around him. You see

3243
03:48:15,327 --> 03:48:21,048
all the wax around him is beginning to burn and
bubble in the immediate vicinity. He's going to

3244
03:48:21,048 --> 03:48:29,260
make two fire rake attacks: one against you, and
one against you. Against you, that is an 18.

3245
03:48:29,260 --> 03:48:31,032
LIAM: Oh, I'm an 18 AC.

3246
03:48:31,032 --> 03:48:38,694
MATT: That hits you, just barely. And against you,
that is a 16.

3247
03:48:38,694 --> 03:48:40,120
TRAVIS: That misses.

3248
03:48:40,120 --> 03:48:49,351
MATT: All right, it misses you. You, however,
suffer 19 points of fire damage.

3249
03:48:49,351 --> 03:48:51,118
LIAM: Do svidaniya.

3250
03:48:51,118 --> 03:48:52,680
(groaning)

3251
03:48:52,680 --> 03:48:58,036
MATT: (impact) Falls to the ground, burning in
cinders. Still conscious, but hurting.

3252
03:48:58,036 --> 03:49:00,398
LIAM: Still conscious?

3253
03:49:00,398 --> 03:49:02,959
MATT: Not conscious, sorry. Still <i>alive</i>.

3254
03:49:02,959 --> 03:49:04,304
LIAM: Still alive.

3255
03:49:04,304 --> 03:49:13,244
MATT: All right, and with that, you watch as
Rakanishu begins to move into the chamber, and the

3256
03:49:13,244 --> 03:49:21,265
presence begins to light the commodes on fire. The
wood's beginning to burn. The entire area is now

3257
03:49:21,265 --> 03:49:22,531
in flames.

3258
03:49:22,531 --> 03:49:25,929
LIAM: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Pots.

3259
03:49:25,929 --> 03:49:28,484
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity as he
moves away from you.

3260
03:49:28,484 --> 03:49:31,514
TRAVIS: That's a 24.

3261
03:49:31,514 --> 03:49:34,353
MATT: That hits. You suffer five points of fire
damage.

3262
03:49:34,353 --> 03:49:45,150
TRAVIS: That's nine points of bludgeoning damage,
and I'll put some Branding Smite into it, as well,

3263
03:49:45,150 --> 03:49:48,490
as a bonus action. Do I get a bonus action as a
reaction?

3264
03:49:48,490 --> 03:49:52,940
MATT: On a reaction, you don't, so you can't do
that. Nine points of bludgeoning. All right--

3265
03:49:52,940 --> 03:49:58,938
TALIESIN: Is he within 15 feet of me now? He has
to do a wisdom saving throw.

3266
03:49:58,938 --> 03:50:00,845
MATT: Okay. Natural 20.

3267
03:50:00,845 --> 03:50:02,556
(groaning)

3268
03:50:02,556 --> 03:50:05,323
MATT: Still takes damage, but it's halved, I
believe.

3269
03:50:05,323 --> 03:50:11,608
TALIESIN: That's 3d8. 12, so six points of radiant
damage.

3270
03:50:11,608 --> 03:50:15,068
MATT: Six points of radiant damage onto Rakanishu.
All right, end of the turn, top of your turn,

3271
03:50:15,068 --> 03:50:22,386
Lohkor, you suffer three points of fire damage
from the proximity of the fire aura. All right,

3272
03:50:22,386 --> 03:50:24,041
your turn.

3273
03:50:24,041 --> 03:50:31,715
TRAVIS: My turn. Two attacks against him. That's a
23, should hit, and the second one is-- no, that's

3274
03:50:31,715 --> 03:50:33,136
not a hit.

3275
03:50:33,136 --> 03:50:35,531
MATT: Okay, so four points of fire damage from the
first hit.

3276
03:50:35,531 --> 03:50:47,101
TRAVIS: Nine points of bludgeoning damage, and as
a bonus action, I'm going to put Branding Smite

3277
03:50:47,101 --> 03:50:54,017
into it, which is 2d6 radiant damage, and the
enemy glows bright.

3278
03:50:54,017 --> 03:50:56,828
MATT: I think he's pretty bright as it is.

3279
03:50:56,828 --> 03:50:58,565
TRAVIS: Four points of radiant damage.

3280
03:50:58,565 --> 03:51:03,720
MATT: All righty, got it. That ends your turn? All
right, so you rush up to him. All of you are

3281
03:51:03,720 --> 03:51:08,803
clustered in the commode, which is now in flames
all around. Aerwin, your turn.

3282
03:51:08,803 --> 03:51:10,580
JENNIFER: I'm going to shoot him with the
crossbow--

3283
03:51:10,580 --> 03:51:14,260
MATT: You're now on the other side of the chamber,
crossbow out. Go for it.

3284
03:51:14,260 --> 03:51:20,333
JENNIFER: 18. 26.

3285
03:51:20,333 --> 03:51:21,828
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

3286
03:51:21,828 --> 03:51:23,389
LIAM: Is Lohkor adjacent? Okay.

3287
03:51:23,389 --> 03:51:25,111
JENNIFER: 1d6?

3288
03:51:25,111 --> 03:51:31,305
LIAM: Yeah, you hit, so a cube, plus sneak attack
damage. Four, plus these guys.

3289
03:51:31,305 --> 03:51:39,126
JENNIFER: 16. 21.

3290
03:51:39,126 --> 03:51:48,918
MATT: 21 points of damage. Okay, so it sticks in
the back, and you watch the flames, while growing,

3291
03:51:48,918 --> 03:51:54,730
it's starting to grow thin. The flames are growing
more disparate, and the connectivity of all this

3292
03:51:54,730 --> 03:51:59,325
fire is beginning to look like the mass is
lessening. The damage is starting to take a toll

3293
03:51:59,325 --> 03:52:02,511
on it. Are you going to stay where you are?

3294
03:52:02,511 --> 03:52:05,373
JENNIFER: I'll back up.

3295
03:52:05,373 --> 03:52:09,985
MATT: So you're even further away on the opposite
side? Gotcha. All right, cool. That brings us to--

3296
03:52:09,985 --> 03:52:12,544
make a death saving throw.

3297
03:52:12,544 --> 03:52:15,358
LIAM: Yo. I'm good.

3298
03:52:15,358 --> 03:52:19,345
MATT: All right. Greldemeyer, you're up.

3299
03:52:19,345 --> 03:52:20,924
LAURA: Greldamine.

3300
03:52:20,924 --> 03:52:22,051
MATT: Greldamine, sorry.

3301
03:52:22,051 --> 03:52:24,130
LAURA: It's fine. It's a hard name.

3302
03:52:24,130 --> 03:52:25,639
TRAVIS: Grundlemeyer.

3303
03:52:25,639 --> 03:52:26,518
MATT: Gwendelmere.

3304
03:52:26,518 --> 03:52:37,699
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- Grandlefarts!-- Sleep
again, at 2nd-level.

3305
03:52:37,699 --> 03:52:39,735
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll the dice.

3306
03:52:39,735 --> 03:52:41,702
LIAM: On the thing?

3307
03:52:41,702 --> 03:52:44,928
LAURA: Yeah. That's how many? 7d8?

3308
03:52:44,928 --> 03:52:46,751
MATT: 7d8.

3309
03:52:46,751 --> 03:53:08,967
LAURA: (counting) 25.

3310
03:53:08,967 --> 03:53:18,539
MATT: You watch as the flame begins to flicker a
bit, then die down to this tiniest little candle

3311
03:53:18,539 --> 03:53:24,890
flicker on the ground. And there, you see this
tiny flame that's wavering lazily. Room is still

3312
03:53:24,890 --> 03:53:29,912
on fire, and everything around it is awful, but
apparently, it was at a point where the Sleep

3313
03:53:29,912 --> 03:53:31,164
could take effect.

3314
03:53:31,164 --> 03:53:36,279
LAURA: Oh my gosh! You guys, grab as many candles
as you can, and let's get the hell out of here!

3315
03:53:36,279 --> 03:53:38,014
TRAVIS: Snuff that flame?

3316
03:53:38,014 --> 03:53:42,100
LAURA: I don't know! If you damage it, it wakes
back up. I'm not exactly sure how this thing

3317
03:53:42,100 --> 03:53:43,234
works.

3318
03:53:43,234 --> 03:53:53,622
JENNIFER: I have a waterskin. If it's that size
and sleeping, would that much water take it out?

3319
03:53:53,622 --> 03:53:58,879
LAURA: Let's grab all the candles we can. They
might all be completely melted.

3320
03:53:58,879 --> 03:54:00,324
MATT: Make an investigation check.

3321
03:54:00,324 --> 03:54:02,126
LIAM: About 20 seconds have passed. Should I make
another death save?

3322
03:54:02,126 --> 03:54:03,471
MATT: Yes, you should.

3323
03:54:03,471 --> 03:54:09,522
LAURA: Can somebody else please make an
investigation check? We're searching for candles.

3324
03:54:09,522 --> 03:54:11,262
TRAVIS: 16.

3325
03:54:11,262 --> 03:54:12,714
TALIESIN: Take 2d4 plus two.

3326
03:54:12,714 --> 03:54:19,190
MATT: You manage to find an armful of soft
candles. They're pushed together and mush now.

3327
03:54:19,190 --> 03:54:22,874
LAURA: Is there a bag I can shove some wax into?

3328
03:54:22,874 --> 03:54:28,188
MATT: You've got sacks. You quickly start filling
sacks. How long does the spell last for Sleep?

3329
03:54:28,188 --> 03:54:31,104
LAURA: It doesn't say. Oh, a minute.

3330
03:54:31,104 --> 03:54:34,149
MATT: Okay. You've got to hurry.

3331
03:54:34,149 --> 03:54:35,804
LAURA: Really quickly!

3332
03:54:35,804 --> 03:54:37,318
LIAM: What happened?

3333
03:54:37,318 --> 03:54:38,604
TALIESIN: Good things. We're running!

3334
03:54:38,604 --> 03:54:39,745
LIAM: Did I get him?

3335
03:54:39,745 --> 03:54:40,721
TALIESIN: Yes. We're running.

3336
03:54:40,721 --> 03:54:41,485
LIAM: What are we doing?

3337
03:54:41,485 --> 03:54:44,174
LAURA: Right as we're running out, pour the water
on him, and we'll jump in the latrine.

3338
03:54:44,174 --> 03:54:46,740
JENNIFER: Got it. It's done!

3339
03:54:46,740 --> 03:54:50,339
MATT: So you guys all rush into the latrine room,
and what are you doing?

3340
03:54:50,339 --> 03:54:54,859
JENNIFER: I have the waterskin. I'm going to pour
some water on this tiny flame and try to kill it.

3341
03:54:54,859 --> 03:54:59,183
MATT: All right, so you uncork it and pour the
water onto the flame. You watch the flame

3342
03:54:59,183 --> 03:55:06,911
(whoosh). It restores into the full Rakanishu
elemental. The room immediately, all the flames

3343
03:55:06,911 --> 03:55:09,899
brighten once more. What are you guys doing?

3344
03:55:09,899 --> 03:55:11,268
LAURA: Jumping into the latrine!

3345
03:55:11,268 --> 03:55:15,231
TRAVIS: Yeah, jump into the latrine, and maybe let
the raging current take us wherever.

3346
03:55:15,231 --> 03:55:16,529
JENNIFER: It goes somewhere.

3347
03:55:16,529 --> 03:55:21,838
MATT: The rushing river, you mean? Okay.

3348
03:55:21,838 --> 03:55:29,304
LIAM: Right, so we make a run, and I make a wisdom
save, and I fail, so I turn around and go back. I

3349
03:55:29,304 --> 03:55:30,500
drop my candles.

3350
03:55:30,500 --> 03:55:34,598
MATT: All of you guys dive into the water, letting
the water take you like a water slide, one after

3351
03:55:34,598 --> 03:55:43,538
the other, and you watch as Quazirat turns around
with Adventurefury, the Blessed Blade of the

3352
03:55:43,538 --> 03:55:51,821
Thrill-Seeker in his hand, and knows, "No, this is
your fate. This is your glory." And the last thing

3353
03:55:51,821 --> 03:55:55,915
you see before you all vanish into the water is
him scream and run towards the reformed

3354
03:55:55,915 --> 03:55:58,255
Rakanishu's elemental form.

3355
03:55:58,255 --> 03:56:02,524
LIAM: LRJenkins1234!

3356
03:56:02,524 --> 03:56:05,294
JENNIFER: Your father's proud of you!

3357
03:56:05,294 --> 03:56:12,070
MATT: So at this point, darkness takes over.
You're being rushed around the current. It's

3358
03:56:12,070 --> 03:56:15,472
battering you around at a rapid speed. Even those
of you with darkvision, things are coming by so

3359
03:56:15,472 --> 03:56:23,025
fast that you're only seeing things quick enough
before it impacts you. I need all of you to make a

3360
03:56:23,025 --> 03:56:25,364
perception check. If you have darkvision, you make
it with advantage.

3361
03:56:25,364 --> 03:56:32,426
TALIESIN: 19.

3362
03:56:32,426 --> 03:56:33,911
MATT: Success.

3363
03:56:33,911 --> 03:56:35,177
LAURA: 23.

3364
03:56:35,177 --> 03:56:36,301
TRAVIS: 16.

3365
03:56:36,301 --> 03:56:38,025
JENNIFER: 17.

3366
03:56:38,025 --> 03:56:43,150
MATT: 17? Okay, you all succeed, so you only
suffer three points of bludgeoning damage as you

3367
03:56:43,150 --> 03:56:45,911
guys are being battered around-- oh, you go limp
and unconscious.

3368
03:56:45,911 --> 03:56:47,608
TRAVIS: Oh, you do?!

3369
03:56:47,608 --> 03:56:49,302
JENNIFER: I only had two left.

3370
03:56:49,302 --> 03:56:53,705
MATT: All right, as you're being thrust around
inside, the river's carrying you, and you're

3371
03:56:53,705 --> 03:56:58,762
trying to hold your breath. The air escapes your
lungs. You guys all try your best to hold

3372
03:56:58,762 --> 03:57:04,112
together. You hit another sequence of rock. Using
your perception from before, you still only suffer

3373
03:57:04,112 --> 03:57:12,393
another seven points of bludgeoning amongst you,
so seven, seven-- actually, it would be half, so

3374
03:57:12,393 --> 03:57:21,116
three to each of you. Eventually, after a minute
or so, your lungs begin to burn from holding in

3375
03:57:21,116 --> 03:57:23,304
the air. What's your constitution?

3376
03:57:23,304 --> 03:57:25,558
TRAVIS: 16.

3377
03:57:25,558 --> 03:57:26,568
MATT: What about you?

3378
03:57:26,568 --> 03:57:28,695
LAURA: 13.

3379
03:57:28,695 --> 03:57:29,837
TALIESIN: 14.

3380
03:57:29,837 --> 03:57:34,945
MATT: Okay, so your air begins to escape your
lungs. You can't hold it anymore and you begin to

3381
03:57:34,945 --> 03:57:39,638
drown just as a light comes to you. All of a
sudden, the thrusting of water stops, and you're

3382
03:57:39,638 --> 03:57:46,491
all free-floating in water, and you all begin to
scavenge around for any sense of what's up, what's

3383
03:57:46,491 --> 03:57:51,797
down. The light is below you, the glow, and you
begin to right yourself and realize that that is

3384
03:57:51,797 --> 03:57:56,578
actually above. You look up, and it looks to be
there's a surface of water. You all begin to swim

3385
03:57:56,578 --> 03:58:01,298
up-- at least, those of you that are conscious.
You're struggling and drowning, and you limply

3386
03:58:01,298 --> 03:58:03,529
begin to float to the surface.

3387
03:58:03,529 --> 03:58:06,721
TALIESIN: Is she floating to the surface? I'm
going to follow her up, then.

3388
03:58:06,721 --> 03:58:12,796
MATT: Okay. Make a constitution saving throw.

3389
03:58:12,796 --> 03:58:15,500
TRAVIS: Is my plate mail a problem?

3390
03:58:15,500 --> 03:58:18,966
MATT: You have a high constitution, so you're able
to hold your breath longer.

3391
03:58:18,966 --> 03:58:22,210
(laughter)

3392
03:58:22,210 --> 03:58:24,491
LAURA: Ten?

3393
03:58:24,491 --> 03:58:29,772
MATT: Ten? You go unconscious and begin drowning.

3394
03:58:29,772 --> 03:58:31,872
LAURA: Does that mean I start floating?

3395
03:58:31,872 --> 03:58:36,075
MATT: You're scrambling under the water and go
limp and begin to slowly rise up, as well. Two of

3396
03:58:36,075 --> 03:58:37,923
them begin to rise up in the water.

3397
03:58:37,923 --> 03:58:39,301
LIAM: Rise up.

3398
03:58:39,301 --> 03:58:46,845
MATT: All right, as you guys break the surface,
(gasping) you glance around, gasping in the cold

3399
03:58:46,845 --> 03:58:52,596
air. The blue sky above you is nearly cloudless: a
welcome sight as you recognize the nearby docks

3400
03:58:52,596 --> 03:58:58,371
and humble buildings of Lakeshore, where you once
left. You apparently were jettisoned to the bottom

3401
03:58:58,371 --> 03:59:01,887
of Lake Everstill, and you're just around the
corner from where you started this venture.

3402
03:59:01,887 --> 03:59:07,369
TALIESIN: Healing Word, level two; Healing Word,
level three.

3403
03:59:07,369 --> 03:59:14,142
MATT: Okay, you come to consciousness. She's a
little worse for wear.

3404
03:59:14,142 --> 03:59:18,131
LAURA: Oh no. Do you have Revivify?

3405
03:59:18,131 --> 03:59:23,728
TALIESIN: If I use my Healing Word not knowing
that she was dead-- did I use my Healing Word not

3406
03:59:23,728 --> 03:59:30,584
knowing she was dead? Because I'm out of magic, at
that point, if I've used two Healing Words.

3407
03:59:30,584 --> 03:59:32,884
MATT: Make a medicine check.

3408
03:59:32,884 --> 03:59:34,455
TALIESIN: All right, that'll do.

3409
03:59:34,455 --> 03:59:36,798
LIAM: Also, did his spell reach three miles back?

3410
03:59:36,798 --> 03:59:38,154
MATT: No.

3411
03:59:38,154 --> 03:59:40,192
TALIESIN: Oh! 24.

3412
03:59:40,192 --> 03:59:45,010
MATT: 24? Glancing over as you begin to cast the
spell, you recognize the signs that she is not--

3413
03:59:45,010 --> 03:59:48,455
TALIESIN: Revivify on this one, Healing Word at
level two on this one.

3414
03:59:48,455 --> 03:59:53,283
MATT: Okay, I'll allow that. For the purposes of
this, you reach over, and from the cold shackles

3415
03:59:53,283 --> 04:00:02,431
of death, the spirit of Aerwin, who went on to
greet the goddess Elune, is pulled back into her

3416
04:00:02,431 --> 04:00:05,768
form as she gasps for breath back at the surface
and begins to paddle.

3417
04:00:05,768 --> 04:00:08,523
TALIESIN: Big dwarven punch in the face. Wake up!

3418
04:00:08,523 --> 04:00:15,199
MATT: The four of you slowly scramble and make
your way towards the shores of Lake Everstill.

3419
04:00:15,199 --> 04:00:27,219
Waterlogged and down one ally, you make your way,
beaten and bruised. So you have two satchels of

3420
04:00:27,219 --> 04:00:34,952
no-longer-soft candles, and you make your way
inside Lakeshore Inn, which has another patron

3421
04:00:34,952 --> 04:00:39,844
now, so business is booming. You see as Wental
turns around as you enter and goes, "My goodness,

3422
04:00:39,844 --> 04:00:47,910
"friends! You've returned! Oh, and a little worse
for wear, but where's your friend with the

3423
04:00:47,910 --> 04:00:49,025
"beard?"

3424
04:00:49,025 --> 04:00:50,116
TRAVIS: He died.

3425
04:00:50,116 --> 04:00:52,030
LAURA: He died getting your candles.

3426
04:00:52,030 --> 04:00:53,539
TALIESIN: You owe us lunch.

3427
04:00:53,539 --> 04:00:59,524
MATT: "I'm terribly sorry, but food can be
prepared. That's a shame. But did you get my

3428
04:00:59,524 --> 04:01:00,867
"candles?"

3429
04:01:00,867 --> 04:01:02,065
TRAVIS: Show him the bag.

3430
04:01:02,065 --> 04:01:11,058
MATT: As you dump out a solid rock of wax onto the
wooden table, he glances down.

3431
04:01:11,058 --> 04:01:19,945
LAURA: Those creatures, they had melted all of
your candles already. We saved as much wax as we

3432
04:01:19,945 --> 04:01:21,501
could for you.

3433
04:01:21,501 --> 04:01:30,400
MATT: "Let me go make some breakfast." As he
shell-shockedly makes his way towards the kitchen,

3434
04:01:30,400 --> 04:01:37,082
you all sit down, pull the wooden chairs out, slap
down on the table, water still dripping from your

3435
04:01:37,082 --> 04:01:45,107
armor and clothes. You sit there, grab whatever
half-drunk tankards you left as you exited, finish

3436
04:01:45,107 --> 04:01:53,577
them off, make eye contact, and think, "Man, can
it really be worse up on Argus right about now?"

3437
04:01:53,577 --> 04:01:56,349
And that's where we'll close today's game.

3438
04:01:56,349 --> 04:01:59,710
(cheering)

3439
04:01:59,710 --> 04:02:01,829
LAURA: Oh no, poor Toes!

3440
04:02:01,829 --> 04:02:04,231
LIAM: Will one of you please look after my WoW
account?

3441
04:02:04,231 --> 04:02:09,364
JENNIFER: Absolutely.

3442
04:02:09,364 --> 04:02:11,620
MATT: Thank you guys so much for playing. Thank
you, Jen, for coming and joining us.

3443
04:02:11,620 --> 04:02:16,304
JENNIFER: Thank you! This was so fun. Thank you.
Amazing.

3444
04:02:16,304 --> 04:02:20,319
MATT: Thank you guys for coming and joining us.
Thank you very much to Blizzard for working with

3445
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:26,699
us and putting this together and letting us play
in Azeroth for a bit. Once again, please check out

3446
04:02:26,699 --> 04:02:32,309
the Kobolds & Catacombs expansion for Hearthstone
releasing on December 7th, and they're streaming

3447
04:02:32,309 --> 04:02:38,134
on the official Blizzard Twitch and YouTube on the
5th for their awesome Kobolds & Catacombs escape

3448
04:02:38,134 --> 04:02:43,633
room. Thank you guys, again. Have a wonderful
night, and is it Thursday yet?

3449
04:02:43,633 --> 04:02:46,875
(cheering)
