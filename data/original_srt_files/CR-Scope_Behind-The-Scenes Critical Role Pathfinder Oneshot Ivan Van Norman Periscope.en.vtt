NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:08.808
IVAN: Hey guys! I'm going to wait for people to
jump in here before I start rambling. I'm going to

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:15.335
Periscope a little bit since we're running behind,
because why not? And because people are waiting.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.226
TALIESIN: People love that shit.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:23.974
IVAN: People do love the Periscoping, which is
part of the thing. So hey guys! We're hanging out

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:30.154
here a little bit while we still get stuff up and
running. It's a Monday night, since they're still

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:34.165
getting stuff done with Pathfinder. Good, I can
check my hair, too, because, Jesus, what's going on

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:41.086
there with that? That's weird. Look at that little
cowlick! Look at that cowlick go! Ha ha! Yeah!

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.725
Phoenix is great, thanks for asking, Ozai!

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:45.527
TALIESIN: Quit fucking with your wig, man!

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:51.016
IVAN: Do you know what? It's okay. I need to get a
new one because it's starting to look more brown

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:56.006
instead of red. There's a Taliesin! Look at
Taliesin!

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:57.336
TALIESIN: I'll come over and say hi.

00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:03.016
IVAN: Come over and say hi! Yes, Davian, I missed
being a player. I'm so happy to have an

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:11.148
opportunity to roll dice and not have to worry
about what I'm going to say next. It's very

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:16.148
lovely. I was telling Matt earlier as I was
grabbing all my stuff, I was like, "Is this

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:21.807
"everything I need to bring? Just my character
sheet, right? That's the only-- this is weird." I

00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:29.168
didn't have to bring a box of things for the
normal chaos and craziness. Yeah, Dias, it is very

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:37.177
untamable. Special thanks, guys, for Paizo and
Syrinscape to come to hang out with us and do

00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:43.966
this awesome Pathfinder one-off. Oh look, I found
a Phil! Say hi, Phil! And there's a Taliesin!

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:47.905
What's that? What's that one? There it is. There
they are. See?

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:50.796
TALIESIN: (goblin growling)

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:55.996
IVAN: We're waiting currently for Marisha to show
up, as well as Miss Burch to show up. They are

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.687
inbound. Again, it's a Monday night.

00:01:58.687 --> 00:02:00.765
TALIESIN: It's LA. Monday. Only so much you can
do.

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:04.475
IVAN: It's a school night. It's not a Thursday
night, which I guess traffic just parts ways for

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:06.246
Critical Roll to show up to the set.

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.855
TALIESIN: Spoilers, dude, what the hell?

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:17.106
IVAN: Boop! I think there's a gray. I have to tell
you, I have one of their shirts. Your logo is one

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.275
of my favorites.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:19.997
TALIESIN: Yeah, I really like the logo.

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:26.905
IVAN: It's so good. Yeah, guys, we're just hanging
out in the pre-setup because they're making sure

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:33.197
that Syrinscape: 1. Sounds awesome, and 2. That
Matt's hair is appropriately coiffed, designed,

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:38.284
and styled, because if there's one thing that you
can't have, it's an unattractive-looking Matt on

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:39.295
camera.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:41.784
TALIESIN: They have to dope it first so it sleeps
through the game.

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:45.686
IVAN: They have to make sure they inject it with a
localized anesthetic so that it behaves?

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.856
TALIESIN: Well, it is carnivorous and it can bite
if you haven't had it properly doped down. It's

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.946
used to doing two shows a day, so it's pretty
solid.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:56.315
IVAN: It's fair. Normally, it's usually well-fed
right before a show.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.806
TALIESIN: You can't get it wet and you can't feed
it after midnight.

00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:06.436
IVAN: It spawns little tiny Matt's hair. Yeah, he
heard me.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.576
TALIESIN: Speaking of things that should be an
icon in the chat room.

00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:16.397
IVAN: Oh gosh, Matt's hair? Oh gee. It's funny the
things we make as a result of chat's amazing

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:23.388
knowledge and glory. We have a pantheon of food
gods now because of chat.

00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:27.035
TALIESIN: I don't even know how to say it.

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:34.625
IVAN: How do you say it, Taliesin? Hold on. What
have you been doing since 9:00AM, Taliesin?

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.896
TALIESIN: I have been directing stuff that I can't
talk about.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.546
PHIL: NDA!

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:42.118
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm under NDA, cone of NDA.

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:45.836
IVAN: There's no saving throw for that.

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:49.915
TALIESIN: No saving throw for that. Go back to
your--

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:52.315
IVAN: It actually makes you lose levels.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.566
TALIESIN: Go back to cutting open dead people, at
that point.

00:03:55.566 --> 00:04:06.405
IVAN: Right. Normally, for Monday nights, we do No
Survivors. I will take this opportunity-- oh,

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:13.757
Ozai, yeah, it's an Elfquest tee. Shout out to the
longest running independently published comic

00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:25.767
ever! Love the Elfquest. Normally, we do No
Survivors on Monday nights, but of course, we're

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:35.075
doing this tonight. Sadly, I will not be GMing for
the next three weeks! Ugh! Why? Because I'm going

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:45.256
to be producing Tabletop season four, so there's
that. Yeah. Which, I know, sucks, but guys, it's

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:52.185
for a good cause. It's for Tabletop season four.
It is coming and we're going to be filming very

00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:58.607
soon. Sadly, that means I'm going to have to be
out of the No Survivors loop, which means that

00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:05.186
you're going to get a good buddy of mine GMing
next week and then Miss Jess is going to be GMing

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:11.774
for two weeks. Maybe I'll sneak in as a player on
one of her games, but I can't promise any of that

00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:18.115
at the moment. Announcement! Tabletop Season 4 is
coming! It means that I'll be out for the next

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:23.763
three weeks. Ironically, I'll still be able to do,
not next week's Game the Game, but the week after.

00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:35.847
Jess from No Survivors, Chocobeangirl! Miss
Merizan, all right? It's going to be crazy, but

00:05:35.847 --> 00:05:46.567
I'm very proud of her for taking it by the horns
and going to be amazing GM. ChalkyDragon, I will

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:53.136
not lay out such spoilers as to which guests are
playing as what. I know Wil did confirm that he

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:59.156
wanted Becca and I and Zac to be playing Lanterns,
but you're going to have to wait and wait for the

00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:07.137
episodes to come out before finding out. Yes!
Expect some Periscopes from me on set as we chill

00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:15.196
out and do things. I just zoomed in on myself,
which I didn't mean to do. I'm going to show a

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:19.276
pacing Mercer. Hold on. There it is.

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:25.006
MATT: A frenzy before starting the game.

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:31.697
IVAN: As it is. As you will. It's okay! It's not
like a show has never been late ever.

00:06:31.697 --> 00:06:37.266
MATT: No, this is the first time we've ever fallen
behind and it hurts my soul. That's not true at all.

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:43.786
IVAN: Since I'm just a player, I am totally calm
right now!

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:46.857
MATT: Well, enjoy it!

00:06:46.857 --> 00:06:52.097
IVAN: Enjoy it! It's all right, buddy, I will do
you the favor and I will give you a night off.

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:55.155
Which really isn't a night off because I'm asking
you to come out an extra week.

00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:57.569
MATT: That's okay. A couple of weeks and you can
chill.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:03.817
IVAN: Yeah. Well, I ain't doing shit until after
mid-May because Tabletop.

00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:04.856
MATT: Yeah.

00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:07.477
IVAN: Then, after that, yes.

00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:08.597
MATT: We'll chat.

00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:16.058
IVAN: We shall chat, as always. It's not like I
see you every week or whatever. It's all fleeting.

00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:18.237
Passing in the winds.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:22.994
MATT: All Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves in
Lakehouse, it's my theory.

00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:38.074
IVAN: That's very true. We're still chilling out,
hanging out while we get through stuff. As with

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:46.075
anything, it's chaos. We are doing a show, guys.
As we wait for Eric. Oh wait! We should go say hi

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:54.466
to Eric Mona! Let's go say hi to Eric! (singing)
Are you guys looking at Comixology?

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:55.707
TALIESIN: We are.

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:56.886
IVAN: Is that what you're doing?

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:57.934
TALIESIN: I am.

00:07:57.934 --> 00:07:58.997
IVAN: I love Comixology.

00:07:59.057 --> 00:08:00.705
TALIESIN: I'm currently reading The Wicked + The
Divine. Hi, dear!

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:02.466
ASHLY: I know, it's been so many!

00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:04.087
IVAN: Ashly Burch just arrived.

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:05.467
ASHLY: How are you?

00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:06.705
TALIESIN: I'm good.

00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:12.413
IVAN: We'll all talk class and race-- I'm not
going to spoil what we're playing tonight, guys.

00:08:12.413 --> 00:08:16.817
TALIESIN: You'll be table buddies.

00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:18.306
IVAN: That's great.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:19.758
TALIESIN: This book's amazing.

00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:23.037
IVAN: Let's go say hey. Eric!

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:28.265
TALIESIN: Marisha's here!

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:37.416
IVAN: Is Eric a surprise or is he not?
Okay. Eric! Do you want to say hi to the internet?

00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:38.737
ERIC: Sure!

00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:42.358
IVAN: Guys, we have a special guest tonight. Eric
Mona is here.

00:08:42.358 --> 00:08:43.404
ERIC: Hello!

00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:46.415
IVAN: This is one of the gentlemen, not all of it
because it's a team effort.

00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:47.845
ERIC: It's a team effort.

00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.684
IVAN: But basically you can thank him for
Pathfinder.

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:52.807
ERIC: Hmm, and lots of other people. I'm the
publisher of Pathfinder.

00:08:52.842 --> 00:08:58.025
IVAN: He is the publisher and he's here tonight
making sure that: 1. That we're awesome, and 2.

00:08:58.025 --> 00:08:59.247
That we do everything right.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.595
ERIC: I'm going to make sure every rule is 100%
correct.

00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:06.085
IVAN: He's going to pass little notes in the
middle of every single session and Matt's going to be

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:07.915
like, "Calm."

00:09:07.937 --> 00:09:11.248
ERIC: I think it's going to work just great. I
don't think it's going to be a problem.

00:09:11.248 --> 00:09:13.216
IVAN: I think it'll be fine. I don't think it's
going to be an issue. We're going to have a good time.

00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:17.125
ERIC: We can all do this together. The chat can
help and keep everything online.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.468
MARISHA: Hi!

00:09:18.468 --> 00:09:23.247
IVAN: Hi! I think everybody's here, guys, ladies,
everybody, people.

00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:24.715
CREW: I'm going to steal him.

00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:31.446
IVAN: Go steal. We're going to get it up so we can
get the show going. See you later, guys! Bye!

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.154
MATT: What?!
