00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:03,596
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:10,712
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons
and occasionally leave sobbing messes. Tonight's

3
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:14,920
going to be a very interesting episode. Before we
get into that, let's go ahead and coast through

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,103
our announcements so we can get to the actual game
at hand. First and foremost, we want to thank our

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:24,243
sponsor for many weeks still going, Loot Crate!

6
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:26,666
ALL: Loot Crate!

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,925
MATT: Thank you so much. Sam, did you have
something prepared?

8
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:33,658
SAM: I don't really have anything prepared this
week, guys. Instead, I thought I'd tell you a

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:38,122
little story about something that happened to a
friend of mine. Her name is Jessie. We grew up

10
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:42,784
together in a small town. When she went away to
college, she didn't want to go because she was a

11
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:46,217
homebody. Her parents said, just go, have fun,
you'll love it.

12
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:51,555
She got to college. A couple of weeks into it, she
and her roommate went out at night. She came home.

13
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:56,579
She fell asleep. They were a little tipsy. She
woke up in the middle of the night to this

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,662
scratching sound and she couldn't figure out what
it was. She just went back to sleep. Got up again,

15
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:07,512
heard another scratching sound. What was it? She
couldn't figure it out. She went back to sleep.

16
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:14,125
The next morning, she woke up. Her roommate, the
skin had been ripped off of her body, and the cat

17
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:19,538
that they shared had also been turned essentially
inside out. And on the wall in the blood of her

18
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:26,897
roommate was written: Use code criticalrole for $3
off.

19
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:29,002
TRAVIS: That's a lot of blood.

20
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:35,005
SAM: That's a lot of blood, and it's a lot of
savings for the new Loot Crate, whose theme is

21
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:42,842
horror. Channel your best Final Girl with items
from The Walking Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street,

22
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:48,593
Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre,
Halloween, and the story I just told. Hey, should

23
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:49,922
we open them up, guys?

24
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:53,653
TRAVIS: Yeah! Now, I think this is September's
theme.

25
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:59,280
SAM: This is definitely horror. Let's open them
and see what horror items we have?

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,180
LIAM: Whoa, look at this scary car!

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,598
LAURA: Whoa!

28
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:08,002
LAURA: Look at this scary keychain of Batman!

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,877
MATT: Scary Stark Industries.

30
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,593
TRAVIS: Stark Motor Racing.

31
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:13,690
TALIESIN: The scariest Stark Industries.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,283
SAM: Look, it's Dark Knight.

33
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:17,423
LAURA: No, it's Gone in Sixty Seconds.

34
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:23,798
MARISHA: Nicolas Cage was scary in Gone in Sixty
Seconds, just throwing it out there.

35
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:25,801
MATT: I forgot he was in that movie.

36
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,937
LAURA: Ashley, do you want this?

37
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:36,988
SAM: What's the pin? The pin says Loot Year. Oh,
it's like Goodyear.

38
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:39,223
TRAVIS: Is this really a hood ornament?

39
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:40,444
MARISHA: Yeah.

40
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:43,056
LAURA: That's pretty sick.

41
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:48,574
SAM: But in all seriousness, Loot Crate is a big
supporter of the show, so we want to support them.

42
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:56,802
Go online, go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Sign
up, get subscriptions for all of your friends and

43
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,096
all of your dead friends who died tragically in a
horror.

44
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,155
LAURA: (laughter) In a horror.

45
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,548
TRAVIS: I used to break those off of the front of
people's cars when I was a kid because I was an

46
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:05,584
asshole.

47
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:16,192
MATT: Yeah, you were. (laughs) Great! Thank you,
Sam. Next up on the list, I will actually be down

48
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:23,447
in San Diego tomorrow for the first day of
TwitchCon. I have a panel in room FrankerZ. It's

49
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:32,373
at 6:30 to 7:30pm about GMing roleplaying games on
Twitch. It's going to be me, Adam Koebel, Chris

50
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:36,666
Perkins, a bunch of great people that run a lot of
great RPG programming on Twitch. We're going to be

51
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,579
talking about our experiences running it,
answering questions, all that fun stuff, so if

52
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,669
you're already down there or you're in the San
Diego area, come tomorrow and say hi at the panel

53
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:45,715
at 6:30. It'll be awesome.

54
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:46,845
LAURA: 6:30am.

55
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:54,408
MATT: Oh, totally. No, never. 6:30pm in FrankerZ,
I think is the room, unless I'm reading the emails

56
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:57,674
wrong. That's the only room information I was
given. FrankerZ is the guy who's sending me the

57
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:58,812
emails.

58
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:02,094
SAM: (stage whispering) They're our fucking
sponsors! Leave the box on the goddamn table!

59
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:06,068
TRAVIS: I got it!

60
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:13,507
MATT: Anyway, speaking of fun news, Laura, you
wanted to mention something about some things up

61
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,606
on the store?

62
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:15,675
LAURA: Yes, this is exciting!

63
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,544
SAM: Is it about your friend who went to college?

64
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:22,773
LAURA: Her face was ripped off, but when her body
was discovered, she was wearing one of these How

65
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:27,398
Do You Want to Do This? hoodies. These sweatshirts
that have been available before and then we took

66
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:30,219
them away. But guess what, guys? They're back!

67
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,590
TRAVIS: We made more!

68
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,028
LAURA: For two weeks of preorder, you can get
these comfy, cozy hoodies.

69
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,606
TRAVIS: What is that voice you're doing?

70
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:39,645
(laughter)

71
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:43,415
LAURA: There's other things in the store too, like
our beautiful mug that I don't have on the table

72
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:47,450
today that Ashley used in Blindspot!

73
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,607
MARISHA: Yes. And Christmas is right around the
corner, you guys!

74
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,467
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's getting cold, so make sure you
bundle up nice and warm.

75
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:58,255
MATT: It is, no joke, the most comfortable hoodie
I've ever owned.

76
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,365
LAURA: You'll be wearing it all the time.

77
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,770
LIAM: Soft as hell.

78
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,806
MATT: I was a little worried when we started doing
actual wearable merch, I was like, it's going to

79
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,366
end up being that chintzy stuff that we don't want
to hawk, but I'm actually really happy that it

80
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,071
came out pretty high-quality.

81
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,985
MARISHA: I miss school relay races.

82
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,625
MATT: What?

83
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,160
MARISHA: Sorry, go ahead. Nothing. Don't worry
about it. Keep going.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,472
MATT: Anyway, anything else you want to talk
about? Nope, then let's go ahead and get into

85
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,547
tonight's episode of Critical Role!

86
00:05:23,547 --> 00:06:54,738
[dramatic music]

87
00:06:54,775 --> 00:07:00,523
MATT: Welcome back. Before we begin, real fast, I
have been notified that Twitch is having some

88
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:06,108
audio sync issues. Recommendation has been said to
try and switch between the Flash player or the

89
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:10,806
HTML5 player on Twitch. That seems to be fixing
the issues for a lot of people out there. So if

90
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:16,199
you're having issues with that, reloading or
trying that switchover should fix the audio sync

91
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,841
issues if you're having any.

92
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:23,442
Without further ado, last we picked up, Vox
Machina, who had been traveling to collect the

93
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:28,777
Vestiges of Divergence, artifacts from an old
ancient time to gain enough power to combat the

94
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:36,694
Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that
assailed-- (burps) pardon-- Tal'Dorei, led by

95
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:42,599
Thordak the Cinder King. When you get nervous, you
get the burps. I feel like Robert Durst.

96
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:49,372
TRAVIS: Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots.

97
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:57,210
MATT: Different guy. You, in searching these artifacts,
found that one in the city of Ank'Harel had been

98
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,810
taken out from under your nose by a long-forgotten
NPC named Ripley.

99
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,740
MARISHA: Well, she wasn't forgotten.

100
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,989
MATT: You know what I mean. You gave chase down to
the Glintshore Island of the Hespet Archipelago,

101
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:17,638
and upon storming the beaches, destroying her
ship, you walked into the jungle, where an ambush

102
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:23,879
turned into folly. You charged into what appeared
to be a couple of illusions. As the floor

103
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,063
detonated beneath you, setting you across the
ground and starting an encounter with snipers in

104
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,621
position, at half-health and below for most of
you.

105
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:39,179
You gave a very good fight and still managed to
push through. Unfortunately, Dr. Ripley, with the

106
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,550
reveal that she has now bound herself to Orthax,
the shadow demon that once plagued Percy's

107
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:52,808
inspiration and nightmares, bent on vengeance,
managed to take him, slay him, and leave him cold

108
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,067
on the ground.

109
00:08:54,067 --> 00:09:02,500
As a group, you did manage to dissect Dr. Ripley
very aggressively and get vengeance back for your

110
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,023
friend. But where we left off, you'd just let the
adrenaline and the shock of the moment hit you as

111
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:20,160
Ripley's breath expends and a tiny tree begins to
try and break and grow from her corpse on this

112
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,752
parched land.

113
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:26,299
So. What do you want to do?

114
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:33,171
SAM: (chuckles) We have no idea.

115
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,575
LAURA: Oh no.

116
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,571
SAM: Yeah.

117
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:42,586
TRAVIS: Wait, did she originally take Percy's gun?
Was that what she was using?

118
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,167
SAM: I don't think so. She took his designs.

119
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,023
MARISHA: He threw Percy's gun into the pool of
acid.

120
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,647
TRAVIS: Should we collect her gun now?

121
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:54,795
SAM: We're all extremely emotional, but we need to
move quickly if we're going to do anything. We

122
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,511
need to collect all the guns.

123
00:09:56,511 --> 00:10:03,382
MARISHA: We should collect her guns. We need her
other hand, and we need the Vestiges off of her

124
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:04,836
fucking body.

125
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,977
TRAVIS: Well, let's collect those. Quickly.

126
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,133
MARISHA: Grog?

127
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,300
TRAVIS: Yes?

128
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,090
MARISHA: Will you do the honors of taking her
other hand?

129
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,404
TRAVIS: I would love to use my teeth for that. No,
I'll use the axe.

130
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:20,825
MATT: All right. With a heavy thud sound, her hand
is jettisoned from the wrist, her left hand, as it

131
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:25,545
scatters across the broken glass floor of the
center of the jungle here in Glintshore.

132
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,825
TRAVIS: This one, right?

133
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:30,178
SAM: There's only one, so yes, that's the one.

134
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,390
TRAVIS: Bag of Colding.

135
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:39,910
MATT: Fair enough. Kynan is still standing there,
the adrenaline wearing off of him. And he's at a

136
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,745
good 15, 20-foot distance from all of you just
standing.

137
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,361
TRAVIS: I forgot, are we killing him?

138
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:48,551
LIAM: Hold on a second. I walk over. Do you have
the blade?

139
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:54,945
MATT: (stammers) He looks down and he seems to
have dropped it after everything that transpired.

140
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,542
And he picks it up and holds it.

141
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:00,400
LIAM: I've come a long way for that.

142
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,271
MATT: "Take it." He throws it to your feet and it
spins and scatters and comes to a halt at the tip

143
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,815
of your boot

144
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:18,062
LIAM: Wait here a moment, please. I bend down, I
take the knife, and I walk it over to Keyleth and

145
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:28,907
put it in her hands. And I walk back to him. How?

146
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:33,913
MATT: "I didn't mean for any of this to happen."

147
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:44,229
LIAM: How? There are people behind me who want you
dead, and I cannot blame them. How?

148
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:54,329
MATT: "I wouldn't blame them, either. Look, after
we met, I was hurt. I was angry. I knew I could be

149
00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:01,300
"someone, despite what you told me, and I could
prove it, prove that I was worth your attention.

150
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,757
"And I left Emon and my home to seek that destiny
and I'm sure many of you did the same."

151
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:17,107
LIAM: Do you know what shape Emon is in right now?
And <i>this</i> is what you choose to do with your time?

152
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,147
MATT: "You don't know what I've been through!"

153
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:25,133
LIAM: What has that man done to you? What has she
done to you? What have any of them, except for

154
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:28,487
me, done to you? And what have I done except be an
asshole?

155
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:42,716
MATT: "Look, when she picked me up in Kymal, she
taught me a lot. I learned a lot. She also told me

156
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:53,162
"that you weren't who I thought you were. When
everything went down in Emon, with the dragons.

157
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:57,512
"She said <i>you</i> did that!"

158
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:03,704
LIAM: Summoned the dragons?

159
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:10,668
MATT: "You were responsible for it. She had me
listen in to a conversation where you admitted

160
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:13,867
"that it was your fault."

161
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,313
LIAM: I'd like to make an insight check.

162
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,166
MATT: Go for it.

163
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,761
LIAM: (sighs) No.

164
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:26,626
MATT: He seems emotionally on the brim of a
complete nervous breakdown, but he's holding his

165
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:31,225
ground. His hands are shaking in place as he
stands staring at you with the look of a man on

166
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:32,523
the precipice.

167
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,877
LIAM: Kynan, what am I to do with you?

168
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:38,985
LAURA: We'll deal with him later.

169
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:46,705
LIAM: I ought to cut the heart from your ribs. I
ought to cut out my own! Is there anyone else

170
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,934
here, now? Is that it?

171
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:56,247
MATT: "Well, we went back to the cavern to set up,
but you got here too quickly--"

172
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,535
LIAM: How long have you been here?

173
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:00,673
MATT: "Only a few hours."

174
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:06,991
LIAM: A few hours was all it took for that? Are
there more of you?

175
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:09,995
MATT: "We have a few people on the ship."

176
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:13,099
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

177
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:21,586
LIAM: Listen to me. I don't know what's going to
happen in the next 24 hours for you, but the best

178
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:26,307
thing you can do right now is help us. When anyone
asks you to do something, you do it.

179
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:32,099
MATT: "Well, I would ask for a chance to redeem
myself, but I am also beginning to understand what

180
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:45,433
"I've done. And I accept whatever judgment 
you see fit. Just know that-- just know that

181
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,008
"I've been very confused."

182
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:57,565
LIAM: Look at me. Kynan, look at me. You help
right now. Put all that out of your mind. Right

183
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,059
now, you help. Can you do that?

184
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,254
MATT: (whispering) "How can I help?"

185
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:05,272
LIAM: Just do whatever we ask.

186
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:11,446
MATT: "Whatever you want me to tell you. I know a
little bit. Anything, just let me know."

187
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:16,761
LIAM: We're going to table this. Just be
Johnny-on-the-spot right now, all right?

188
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,362
MATT: "Okay."

189
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:24,695
LAURA: (tearfully) Grog? Can you pick him up?
Percy?

190
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:28,912
TRAVIS: Yeah. Where am I taking him?

191
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:33,830
MARISHA: I have nothing left. I have no way to get
us out of here quickly right now.

192
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,803
TRAVIS: Can I ask, is Orthax still here? That's
who that was, right?

193
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,000
LIAM: Yes.

194
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,923
MARISHA: Orthax could have his soul, for all we
know.

195
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,526
LAURA: Do we sense him? Is Orthax around? Can you
sense evil?

196
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,913
LIAM: Yeah, I could, yes.

197
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:56,889
MATT: Okay, so you sense as part of your paladin
ability. Divine Sense, I believe it was?

198
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:06,817
LIAM: Yeah. 60 feet: demons, celestials, devils.

199
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:14,454
MATT: Yeah, as you guys are going through Ripley's
things, you do sense there is a pulse of fiendish

200
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:18,612
energy emanating from somewhere near Ripley's
body.

201
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,140
MARISHA: Near Ripley's body?

202
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,339
LAURA: How do we destroy him?

203
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,682
SAM: I don't think we can. He's just a shadow,
isn't he?

204
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,908
LIAM: We have to go to him.

205
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:33,277
TRAVIS: Oh, I was going to ask the question of
could he help us with Percy.

206
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:35,936
SAM: Orthax?

207
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:36,831
TRAVIS: Yeah.

208
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:42,444
MARISHA: Honestly, right now I think-- it sounds
crazy that I'm saying this, but we have mutual

209
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:46,418
interests with him. It might not be the worst
idea.

210
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:47,992
MATT: Who's inspecting Ripley's body?

211
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:50,477
LAURA: I will, I guess.

212
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:59,749
MATT: A few things you find as you rummage
through. You find about 1,051 gold pieces.

213
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:08,784
Two weeks of rations, some of which appear to 
have been dampened and will probably be gone soon.

214
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:17,292
You do find the cloak. The dagger that Kynan used
still lays to the ground. No, it was handed to

215
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:23,844
you, so you have it right now. There is what
appears to be a small polished grey stone with a

216
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:33,920
couple of runic symbols carved into it. You also
find what appears to be a small leather case, a

217
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:44,926
long thin case about that long, that is latched
shut. And her gun. Which is similar to Percy's

218
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:56,934
Pepperbox, but thinner, longer, more refined. It's
a deep gunmetal gray color with brass sections and

219
00:17:56,934 --> 00:18:06,243
what appear to be portions of whitestone built
into it. As she pulls the gun out, you immediately

220
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:09,740
know that that's the direct source of the fiendish
energy.

221
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,929
LIAM: Put that down. Please. Put it on the
ground.

222
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,195
SAM: It's in the gun?

223
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,571
LIAM: It's in the gun.

224
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,507
MARISHA: Just like last time.

225
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,436
LAURA: So we drop it in acid again?

226
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:29,036
SAM: Well, that didn't kill it, did it? Just got
it out of the gun.

227
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:33,662
MARISHA: And what if he has Percy?

228
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:36,810
LAURA: No!

229
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,047
TRAVIS: Well, let's try and get him back first
before we get upset about it.

230
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,462
LAURA: How do we get him to Whitestone?

231
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,673
TRAVIS: Yeah. How do we move?

232
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,803
SAM: We have an airship.

233
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,634
TRAVIS: That'll be too slow.

234
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,713
SAM: Maybe it can take us somewhere with trees.

235
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:58,781
LAURA: Somewhere with a tree.

236
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:00,454
MARISHA: I need to rest.

237
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,232
TRAVIS: How long?

238
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:04,028
MARISHA: I need to sleep.

239
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:08,058
LIAM: This tree is stunted that's coming out of
Ripley's body?

240
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:11,740
MATT: Yeah. It's a slow-growing tree. It's only
about six feet tall. It wouldn't be large enough

241
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,724
to use her spell through it. This is the
remnants of a Fenthras death. There are a few

242
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:25,070
large jungle trees, like I mentioned before, that
have managed to find root and grow in this jungle.

243
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:33,566
It'd be like one healthy tree for every 50 that
are burnt, charred, and petrified.

244
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:37,921
There are trees available in this jungle that 
in theory could be used for that spell,

245
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,319
if you had it available to you.

246
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,839
TRAVIS: I don't remember, do we have a way to call
Pike?

247
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,095
LAURA: We have the stone.

248
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,197
SAM: Wait, does that send one of us back to her?

249
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,215
LAURA: Potentially.

250
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:52,796
SAM: One living soul holding a dead soul?

251
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,903
TRAVIS: Or can we bring her to us?

252
00:19:54,903 --> 00:20:00,204
MARISHA: I could try and scry her. Let me see,
actually.

253
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:03,088
LAURA: I could try putting Percy in the necklace
and--

254
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:07,228
SAM: Going through? Yes.

255
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:15,575
MARISHA: But what if you can't get him back out?
Living and willing, right?

256
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,208
LAURA: Yes.

257
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,696
MARISHA: We don't want him to get stuck.

258
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:23,907
TRAVIS: Is that correct?

259
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:34,043
SAM: No disrespect, he's an object right now. So
if one of used the stone, holding him, it'd be

260
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:40,814
carrying him like a sword. He'd go through.

261
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:51,536
MATT: Make an intelligence check. With plus two
because of your Jack of All Trades. Add your

262
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,163
intelligence modifier plus two.

263
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,880
SAM: Okay. 16, 18.

264
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,928
MATT: 18? That might not work for most spells.

265
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:03,421
(laughter)

266
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:07,042
SAM: Shame, intelligence check.

267
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:11,993
MATT: He's still considered a creature. It's just
a dead creature.

268
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:18,692
LAURA: So we rest and then we go to Whitestone in
the morning.

269
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:21,561
LIAM: Can you do the mansion, Scanlan? Are you
tapped out?

270
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,877
SAM: I could, but--

271
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:26,465
MARISHA: I can't believe that there's nothing we
can do right now.

272
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:30,086
LIAM: We could stay here.

273
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:36,710
LAURA: I still bring Trinket out of the necklace,
and I cast Cure Wounds on him.

274
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:41,355
MATT: Okay, yeah. As Trinket emerges from the
necklace, his unconscious form hits the ground,

275
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:50,482
laying on the side. As you walk up and place your
hand, still breathing, and your warm touch presses

276
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:57,897
across his fur and the breathing inflates into one
deep breath and then (bear noises) the head leans

277
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:01,771
up and begins licking your hand as you finish the
casting of the spell. Go ahead and roll hit points

278
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:04,361
for Trinket.

279
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:08,560
LIAM: I'm also going to give him a butt scratch
and do Lay on Hands and give him

280
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,724
another five hit points.

281
00:22:19,897 --> 00:22:24,233
LAURA: Nine whole points. Plus five.

282
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:37,481
MATT: You also do notice, Vex, on the gun, it has
across the handle, the bottom of the handle, the

283
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:42,514
name of the weapon, which is named Animus.

284
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:44,086
LAURA: Animus?

285
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,981
MATT: And across the barrels you now see there are
three empty barrels and three that still have

286
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:48,999
names.

287
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,514
LAURA: Can I read the names?

288
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:56,876
MATT: The names are: Rictor Wells, Oz Grud, and
King Bertrand Dwendal.

289
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,506
SAM: Oh my god.

290
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:09,679
MATT: Rictor Wells, Oz Grud, and King Bertrand
Dwendal. Apparently all people that Ripley in some

291
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,227
way, shape, or form felt vengeful towards.

292
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:22,210
LIAM: I'm going to walk over and pick up the false
arm that I hacked off. Will you put this in the

293
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,974
bag?

294
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:26,667
TRAVIS: Which one? Oh, regular bag.

295
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,499
LIAM: This big, old arm here.

296
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:37,268
TRAVIS: Can I see the little stone with the runes
on it?

297
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:41,679
SAM: Why don't we ask Kynan what it is? Maybe he's
seen her use it.

298
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,519
TRAVIS: Kynan, what is this?

299
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,125
MATT: "That's what she used to listen in on you
guys."

300
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:53,404
MARISHA: Ugh. Hang on, wait let me see it. Does it
look like the other Scrying Stone that we have?

301
00:23:53,404 --> 00:24:00,212
MATT: No. It's a very different enchantment. This
one looks a little simpler, and upon looking at it

302
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:09,968
there's no magic left in it. You did disenchant
the other side of the enchantment, of her old

303
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:11,016
gun.

304
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,936
TRAVIS: What about the little latch box that's
closed?

305
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:18,195
SAM: Yeah, open that little box.

306
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:21,290
TRAVIS. I open the latch box. Or she opens the
latch box.

307
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,486
SAM: I open the latch box.

308
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:25,002
LAURA: Just rip everything out of my hands. Go for
it.

309
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:26,457
SAM: We all simultaneously tear it open.

310
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:34,296
MATT: Okay, as you open the cap on the edge of
this leather casing, you pull it open. You see

311
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:41,472
it's essentially a side scroll case. On the
inside, there is a single tightly wound piece of

312
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:50,961
parchment. The smell immediately is very musty and
old with a hint of burnt wood. And yeah, there's

313
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:53,711
some sort of parchment that is tightly coiled in
there.

314
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,569
SAM: Should I take it out and take a look?

315
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,713
TRAVIS: Read that.

316
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:59,020
LAURA: Have you seen her messing with that,
Kynan?

317
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,587
MATT: "That was something we found in the cave
when we got here. But she quickly grabbed it and

318
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,343
put it away and wouldn't tell us what it was."

319
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:07,772
LIAM: What is this cave?

320
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,675
MATT: "I only got to the outside of it. I was
standing guard."

321
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,582
TRAVIS: So you haven't been inside?

322
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:13,705
MATT: "No."

323
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:14,833
LIAM: How far off?

324
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:23,991
MATT: "Maybe a couple of miles. It's at the base
of the mountain."

325
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:27,121
TRAVIS: What if that was her escape route? What if
there's a way out?

326
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:30,760
SAM: Yeah, could be. I'll open it and look it
over.

327
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,316
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

328
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:36,136
MARISHA: Be careful, Scanlan.

329
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:43,078
SAM: Not good. Do I add Jack of All Trades? Is
that a thing now? 16.

330
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:48,027
MATT: Well, you add it to all ability checks and
skills you're not proficient in.

331
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:50,098
SAM: I am proficient in this. 14.

332
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:54,577
MATT: 14. That's fine. That's enough. Yes, it is a
Scroll of Gate.

333
00:25:54,577 --> 00:25:57,522
SAM: A Gate scroll.

334
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:01,209
TRAVIS: Good thing?

335
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,605
MARISHA: Oh, we just got our ticket out of here!

336
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:10,662
SAM: The scroll allows an arcane caster to use an
action to cast the 9th-level spell Gate.

337
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:14,061
LAURA: Do we have an arcane caster? Is that you?
Scanlan?

338
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:15,803
SAM: Am I an arcane caster?

339
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:21,114
MATT: Yeah, you are an arcane caster. Consider
this is an extremely powerful spell that has a lot

340
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:27,085
of various uses, so consider. Just so you
know what it's capable of, I'm going to read you

341
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,564
some of the spell here.

342
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:33,162
SAM: Also, I might not be able to do it because it
says level nine. If the spell is higher than the

343
00:26:33,162 --> 00:26:37,140
level the caster can use, then they must make a
spellcasting ability check to succeed.

344
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,461
TRAVIS: Okay, so just cut off your foot as a
tithe.

345
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:46,403
MATT: So Gate, just so you know: You conjure a
portal linking an unoccupied space you can see

346
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:50,920
within range to a precise location on a different
(or the same) plane of existence. The portal is a

347
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,578
circular opening which you can make five to 20
feet in diameter. It lasts for up to a minute. The

348
00:26:55,578 --> 00:27:01,751
portal has a front and back on each plane where it
appears. It would be between planes essentially. I

349
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:05,011
would say if you wanted to use it as just a
teleportation circle, you could, but it's a waste

350
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,808
of a 9th-level spell.

351
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,020
SAM: But it's a waste of a 9th-level spell?

352
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,372
MATT: Comparatively to what she can do with Tree
Stride and other things like that.

353
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:14,033
MARISHA: We might want to save it.

354
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,679
LIAM: Is it different from Plane Shift?

355
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,474
MATT: Deities and other Planar Rulers can prevent
portals created by this from opening in their

356
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:22,610
presence. When you cast the spell, you can speak
the name of a specific creature. A pseudonym,

357
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,398
title, or nickname doesn't work. Specific name of
a creature. If the creature is on a plane other

358
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:32,009
than the one you're on, the portal opens and pulls
them through to you.

359
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:34,368
So it has a lot of various uses.

360
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:35,965
LAURA: We could bring the rakshasa through.

361
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,342
MARISHA: We could. If we knew its name.

362
00:27:39,342 --> 00:27:40,740
TRAVIS: We stow it.

363
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,978
MATT: You can bring a lot of things through on
that, instantly, for better or for worse.

364
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:49,222
LIAM: Hotis, Orthax.

365
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:54,466
MARISHA: That is how it's different from Plane
Shift.

366
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,819
SAM: Or we could use this to go save our friend.

367
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:01,265
LAURA: What do we know about these healing
spells?

368
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:05,031
TRAVIS: What healing spells?

369
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:12,609
LAURA: Well, what we need to do to Percy. How long
do we have? To get him to someone?

370
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,698
MARISHA: I have a feeling the longer we wait, the
harder it will be.

371
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:24,355
TRAVIS: Then we rest now, yeah? Hard choices, but
we have to help ourselves if we plan to help him.

372
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:29,857
MARISHA: But like you said, the Gate spell could
theoretically bring Orthax back, if we might need

373
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:31,213
to. Who knows?

374
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:33,354
SAM: Or it could bring a healer to us right now.

375
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:41,625
TRAVIS: I say save it and rest. That's my vote.

376
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,304
MARISHA: How long has Percy been dead?

377
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,362
MATT: At this point, maybe 20, 25 minutes.

378
00:28:56,872 --> 00:29:00,591
TRAVIS: Voice your opinions now. Do it.

379
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:03,089
SAM: I don't know how death magic works.

380
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,706
LAURA: I don't, either.

381
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:09,601
SAM: I don't know if eight hours makes this huge
difference.

382
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:18,231
MARISHA: It depends on what you're trying to do. I
have one ability I could use. You have to do it

383
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:23,753
within ten days. But I'm not necessarily
comfortable doing it, regardless. I don't know,

384
00:29:23,753 --> 00:29:31,735
I've never done it before, and I don't know the
ramifications. I'd prefer to get him to Pike.

385
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:34,161
TRAVIS: Then let's summon the mansion and do
this.

386
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:40,415
SAM: All right. But we have to collect things
first. We need all the guns. Even the broken ones.

387
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:44,910
If any one finds any of these, they could be
retrofitted or used for evil in the future and

388
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,347
that's something that Percy would not want. Ever.

389
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:51,463
TRAVIS: I'll go get them, because I'm still doing
pretty dandy and I'll absorb all the glass shards

390
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,428
from walking around.

391
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:58,008
SAM: I need to go find our dog. He probably won't
be able to be found, but he could be somewhere.

392
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,833
And I feel like we should look in this cavern,
don't you think?

393
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,609
LIAM: We could go.

394
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,528
MARISHA: I'll stay with Percy.

395
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,827
SAM: Someone has to stay with him.

396
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:10,849
TRAVIS: Okay. If you two want to go check the
cavern, I'll collect all the guns and check the

397
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,070
bodies of the people that are down.

398
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,819
LAURA: Can we have taken a short rest to heal a
bit before we do anything?

399
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:19,425
MATT: You could do that. Just half an hour to an
hour. You can do that. So you guys take a short

400
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:26,995
rest now to use any of your hit dice to go ahead
and heal up. And Scanlan's giving Song of Rest, so

401
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:28,120
you get an additional--

402
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,819
SAM: 1d12.

403
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:33,353
MATT: 1d12 to each one of you guys on top of
whatever you're healing.

404
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:39,994
MARISHA: Keyleth takes Percy's body and I drag him
over to the table and I lay him out and I start

405
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:45,020
cleaning him and cleaning his wounds as best as I
can.

406
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:53,622
MATT: He's a bloody mess. But at the same time,
there is a strange look of peace on his face. It

407
00:30:53,622 --> 00:31:02,005
both comforts and upsets you. And you have a hard
time concentrating on the face. You're just

408
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:06,997
focusing on the body as you clean him and make him
look as good as you possibly can using Druidcraft

409
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:09,329
and other spells at your disposal.

410
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,721
TRAVIS: Guns and bodies.

411
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:17,722
MATT: Make an investigation check.

412
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:24,622
TRAVIS: Nice. Oh, minus two. 15.

413
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:39,488
MATT: 15. All right, you find, let's see... you
find 620 gold pieces total across all the bodies.

414
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:57,647
You find two pistols, two rifles. There is also a
long-barreled Bad News-like rifle that was

415
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:06,159
discarded across the battlefield by Ripley earlier
in the fight. It's busted. There is a greatsword

416
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,219
and a set of full plate that were on the goliath
that you battled.

417
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,158
TRAVIS: Full plate?

418
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:22,683
MATT: Full plate, yes. You find a total of 185
rounds of small ammunition.

419
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,237
TRAVIS: Okay. For the pistols?

420
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:28,914
MATT: And about 26 rounds of large ammunition for
the rifles.

421
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,645
TRAVIS: Got it. 26 rounds.

422
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:36,823
MATT: You find a potion of superior healing on the
smashed corpse of the wizard that didn't get a

423
00:32:36,823 --> 00:32:44,110
chance to use it before it fell to its horrible
death. That's a really good one. A set of Bracers

424
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,280
of Defense, plus two, which I think you've
encountered previously.

425
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,243
TRAVIS: I have.

426
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:54,753
MATT: So you can write that down. And yeah, that's
all you find on the corpses.

427
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:57,763
TRAVIS: Those Bracers of Defense need to be
attuned?

428
00:32:57,763 --> 00:33:02,238
MATT: It's a plus two. They do need to be attuned,
I'm pretty sure. Let me double check. I'm pretty

429
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:10,197
sure they do. Yeah. And you have the cloak, and
you have the dagger at your disposal, and the gun.

430
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,045
If you wanted to take the time to inspect them
during the short rest.

431
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:16,823
TRAVIS: Okay.

432
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:23,353
MATT: Okay. So. While he's doing that, you guys go
off to the cave?

433
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:27,032
LIAM: Yes. And I'm going to look for traps the
entire way there.

434
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:30,513
LAURA: And I'm going to ride my broom there so I
don't get any damage walking on the glass.

435
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:35,082
MATT: Okay. Is Kynan staying behind with you
guys?

436
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,466
SAM: I can keep him, and he can help me look for
the dog.

437
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:41,083
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

438
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,736
SAM: Does he make one, too?

439
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:45,127
MATT: He does, yeah.

440
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:50,607
SAM: 30.

441
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:55,074
MATT: It takes you the better part of 30 minutes
or so, but the needle in the haystack was not as

442
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:59,808
hard a search as you thought, and you find it
wedged between two branches back in its hard onyx

443
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,920
form. Unscathed, seemingly, from the explosion.

444
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,113
SAM: Just scratch him behind his ear. Sorry! Maybe
we'll do more next time.

445
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:19,441
MATT: All right. You guys, because you're going to
check for traps as you go? Go ahead and roll an

446
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,923
investigation check.

447
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:25,583
LIAM: 18.

448
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:32,126
MATT: Okay. Making your way through, there don't
appear to be any traps in your way. And as you

449
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:37,907
wind through the path, and there is a walked path
following the tracks of the people who had set up

450
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:41,424
the ambush for you and heading towards the
mountain where Kynan had pointed earlier. You do

451
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:45,624
eventually, and also watching your sister above,
and you can see the entrance to this. There is a

452
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:52,745
large volcanic-mouthed cavern at the bottom of the
mountain before it meets the edge of the jungle.

453
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:59,860
You get to it, and it's about 40 feet by 20 feet
initially. And it quickly funnels down. All the

454
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:09,562
rock in here, by the way, is very dark, broken,
porous volcanic texture. It looks like this

455
00:35:09,562 --> 00:35:14,461
mountain at one point in time may have been
volcanically active, or at least, may still be,

456
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:18,456
and there isn't sign of any recent activity.
There's no smoke. There is a heavy sulfurous smell

457
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:26,272
as you get close and actually begin to enter the
front of the cave. Do you guys continue forward

458
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:27,143
into the cavern?

459
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:29,291
LAURA: Is it dark in there?

460
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,787
MATT: Yeah. There's no light source. You guys can
still see up to a certain distance okay

461
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:33,960
without light.

462
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,025
LAURA: Could I--

463
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:42,917
LIAM: I'll check for traps again. I'll pull out
the flame tongue dagger

464
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,191
to get a little more light.

465
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:46,968
MATT: Little bit of torch light.

466
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:52,386
LAURA: I set fire to the tip of an arrow and shoot
it using Oracle Shot into the cave.

467
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:56,186
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your investigation
check.

468
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,344
LIAM: One.

469
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:02,127
MATT: Okay. As you instead are distracted by the
flaming side of the arrow, her lobbing it, and

470
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:07,107
suddenly her eyes just glazing over white. It
catches you off guard, the first time really

471
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:10,350
seeing this happen, and so you weren't even paying
attention to the rest of the cavern.

472
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:16,847
You all of a sudden are having an immediate
first-person of the very tip of the arrow coasting

473
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:21,823
through darkness. The fire itself crackling around
you like you're wreathed in flame. You can hear

474
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:29,220
the flame licking past your ears almost as you
pass through the wind of this still tunnel air.

475
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,385
Eventually, coming down, you can see the tunnel
condenses and then turns sharply right and you

476
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:42,860
scatter against the rock, fall to the side. We'll
see where it lands, actually. Okay. You hit the

477
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:53,492
ground and ahead you can see with a little light
that the tunnel splits into two, but there is...

478
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:58,610
There's detail to the walls that doesn't look 
natural. There is some idea of construction here.

479
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,651
There is structure. Someone has refined elements
of the interior of this tunnel. That's the best

480
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:06,797
you can make out with the arrow's placement.

481
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,421
LIAM: You all right?

482
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:19,201
LAURA: That was cool. It's a fucking tunnel.
There's maybe something in there.

483
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:22,902
(tearfully) I don't know what we're doing. 
I don't know what purpose it serves.

484
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:27,522
LIAM: (voice breaking) I'm so sorry.

485
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,008
I walk in.

486
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:39,696
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue following the
path that the arrow did, the tunnel winds back and

487
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:43,440
forth a bit. It pinches and then curves quickly to
the right, where you find the arrow still lying

488
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,381
there.

489
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:45,693
LIAM: Stealth, please?

490
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:46,945
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

491
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:51,517
LAURA: Can I check for anything that looks out of
place, any danger or anything?

492
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:53,031
Traps, if you will.

493
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:55,830
MATT: Make an investigation check, 
while you're stealthing.

494
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,744
LIAM: 25.

495
00:37:57,744 --> 00:38:05,131
LAURA: Terrible investigation.11.

496
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:06,394
MATT: It seems safe.

497
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:08,014
LAURA: It seems so safe.

498
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:09,135
MATT: Are you stealthing, as well?

499
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:13,013
LAURA: Sure. 20.

500
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:17,564
MATT: Okay. The two of you pushing forward, the
cavern divides to the right and left eventually.

501
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,012
To the right was what you got the glimpse at. To
the left, it just continues, the same kind of

502
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:28,762
porous rock. And it's like a volcanic tube, that
general erosion built a floor that's a little less

503
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:31,100
wide than the walls, which are spherical in shape.

504
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,295
LIAM: So, on the right, it's natural, and on the
left it's more altered.

505
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:37,322
MATT: Other way.

506
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:40,510
LIAM: Other way. So one is natural, one is
touched.

507
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,092
MATT: To the right, where the tunnel curves off,
you can see what appear to be smoothed-over walls,

508
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:49,112
where it's been just either ground down. They're
not perfectly flat but there has been some amount

509
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:55,547
of effort put in making it a smooth-walled
structure. That same burnt sulfur smell is

510
00:38:55,547 --> 00:39:00,281
stronger the deeper into the mountain you go, but
not to the point where it's forcing you to cough.

511
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:03,456
You do feel a little bit of burning in the lungs
from proximity.

512
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:06,118
LAURA: Are there tracks at all in the cave?

513
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:11,765
MATT: There are a few footfalls going through the
dust. Very hastily. They're like jogging-paced

514
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:17,944
footfalls. And even just from some of the tracking
you've done previously in the day, some of these

515
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:21,659
footfalls are of the people that you encountered
earlier, including Ripley.

516
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:27,841
LAURA: I feel like they've already been in here,
and she took what she found.

517
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:35,834
LIAM: Let's be sure. I'll take point. I start
walking down the altered path.

518
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,961
LAURA: Following the path that we see her
footsteps in.

519
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:43,298
MATT: Okay. And carefully stepping forward for the
next ten minutes or so, it goes from a slightly

520
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:49,161
curved and bunched rock formation into a singular
long tunnel that has been pushed into the mountain

521
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:59,640
itself. And it abruptly comes to an end. In here,
the soft, ashy dust that once formed the floor has

522
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,123
given way to crunching of thousands and thousands
of tiny bone shards. And you see before you what

523
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:11,391
appears to be a cluster of hundreds of skulls that
are built up into one altar-like platform.

524
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:24,034
Everything here is burnt. And elements of this
look like a large fiery event transpired in here

525
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:29,518
that destroyed much of what once was a more
structured interior. And this altar, while it

526
00:40:29,518 --> 00:40:34,942
remains in place, it look like it suffered severe
damage in the past. The skulls and rocks that are

527
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:40,605
there, most of them are broken, cracked and thrown
against the walls. This looks very old. It looks

528
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,770
like this place hasn't been touched in a very long
time.

529
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:50,247
LAURA: Anything that looks like a teleportation
circle or anything?

530
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,939
MATT: Investigation check.

531
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:58,500
LAURA: (sighs) Natural one.

532
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:05,502
LIAM: I got an 18. No, I got a 20.

533
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:08,511
MATT: You don't find anything that resembles a
teleportation circle. What you do find is in the

534
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:18,104
altar. It appears that there was a compartment
that has since been opened up that is left vacuous

535
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:23,404
and empty. It appears to have been recently
disturbed.

536
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:26,103
LAURA: Okay. This is what Ripley took. This is
where she found the scroll.

537
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:34,395
MATT: And once you do that, looking at the little
bit of ashy soot that was on the outside of the

538
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:38,281
scroll, you do get the sense that that was
probably what was taken from this altar.

539
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:43,121
LIAM: Do we waste our time with the other passage,
or do we go back?

540
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,476
LAURA: (tearfully) Let's go back.

541
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:53,523
MATT: Eventually, you guys make your way back to
the rest of the camp. You've cleaned up Percy to

542
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:57,685
the best of your ability. You've gathered all the
materials from all the other corpses around the

543
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:03,262
battlefield. You and Kynan return with your onyx
dog. What are you going to do?

544
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:05,516
SAM: We sleep.

545
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:08,249
LAURA: Super restful, just the most restful
sleep.

546
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:15,743
SAM: Yeah, it's going to be a great night. We'll
hang out, tell stories about Percy, cry a bunch.

547
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,249
TRAVIS: Not yet!

548
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:26,471
SAM: Yeah, you're right. All right. What time is
it? How long have we been awake? Should we let the

549
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:28,695
airship know so they don't keep hovering?

550
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:31,623
LAURA: Yes. I'll fly over to them.

551
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:33,118
SAM: We have flares.

552
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:39,425
LAURA: Yeah, but they might not understand what it
means. I'll fly over to them and tell them, what,

553
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:41,040
they can go?

554
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:50,790
SAM: But we don't-- I guess. Is there anything we
need from them? They can bring the arm back to

555
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,719
Ank'Harel. Weren't we supposed to bring her arm
back to Ank'Harel?

556
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,152
LAURA: Yeah, but there wasn't a time limit on
that.

557
00:42:58,152 --> 00:42:59,417
SAM: We'll mail it?

558
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:01,864
LIAM: We'll just hold onto it for now.

559
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:03,547
SAM: Okay.

560
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,240
LAURA: I'll fly up to the airship.

561
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,756
MATT: Okay. It's a little ways south of the
island, but it was at the ready. All of its

562
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:17,102
various arbalest setups are still ready for war.
They're basically just waiting for your guys'

563
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:22,396
order to come and attack. As you come to the edge,
you see Captain Damon immediately rush up and

564
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:32,107
goes, "We saw some sort of explosion on the
island. Is everyone all right?" Immediately his

565
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:36,699
expression drops, and he steps on to the back of
his heels and drops his hands in front of him in a

566
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:40,260
very business-type setup. "I'm sorry."

567
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:47,372
LAURA: We're going to find another way back home.
You can take the airship back to Ank'Harel

568
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:48,620
if you want.

569
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,128
MATT: "Where are you going?"

570
00:43:50,128 --> 00:44:00,615
LAURA: Somewhere with... clerics. I don't know.

571
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:15,123
MATT: "Very good. I guess, if you need me 
and my crew, come find us in Ank'Harel."

572
00:44:15,123 --> 00:44:19,340
LAURA: Of course. Thank you.

573
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:28,216
MATT: "Safe travels. Crew!" And he starts shouting
out to the rest of everyone on the deck. As you

574
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:34,221
coast off, you hear him shouting at a distance
over the wind, "We're going home.

575
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:42,171
"Whatever that is these days." 
You hear the flare of various magical crystals.

576
00:44:42,171 --> 00:44:45,073
The vibration creaks. They glow a brighter blue 
as the ship turns around.

577
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:47,238
LAURA: Oh shit. I go back.

578
00:44:47,238 --> 00:44:48,914
(laughter)

579
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:50,150
MARISHA: Did you leave your purse?

580
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,798
LAURA: Oh, my wallet! No, but I go back up and I
say to Captain Damon:

581
00:44:55,798 --> 00:45:00,586
Are you willing to join a fight?

582
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:07,633
MATT: "Explain."

583
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:17,326
LAURA: Those dragons destroyed our home. We could
use an airship in the fight against them.

584
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:25,077
MATT: "We're outfitted to take down relatively
dangerous prey, but--"

585
00:45:25,077 --> 00:45:27,630
LAURA: You wouldn't be fighting alone.

586
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:37,052
MATT: "I mean no offense here, and the 
honorable goal is fantastic,

587
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:38,611
"but I also have a crew to feed."

588
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:46,891
LAURA: Of course. There's a lot of gold there. A
lot of riches.

589
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,823
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

590
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:51,653
LAURA: I've been rolling so well tonight.

591
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:54,020
LIAM: This is the one.

592
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:58,219
LAURA: 20?

593
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:05,042
MATT: "We'll learn the details later, but I'm
happy to help. Convincing them will take some

594
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:08,921
"coin, but where would you like us to go?"

595
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:11,811
LAURA: (quietly) Oh shit. Should I?

596
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,466
SAM: We're not there.

597
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:18,538
LAURA: (sighs) Do you know where Whitestone is?

598
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:20,671
MATT: "I've not been there, but I can figure it
out."

599
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,044
LAURA: It's in the mountains.

600
00:46:22,044 --> 00:46:32,794
MATT: He looks over, and you can see Teera, who is
the halfling with the rotted teeth, comes up and

601
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:37,793
goes, "I know that's by the Alabaster Sierras. 
I can get us there."

602
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:42,835
LAURA: I'm trusting you with that location.

603
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:51,704
MATT: "All right." She bows her head and backs
away, uncomfortable with the tension

604
00:46:51,704 --> 00:46:53,119
of the situation.

605
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,974
Captain Damon goes, "We'll meet you in
Whitestone."

606
00:46:56,974 --> 00:46:58,804
LAURA: Thank you.

607
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,432
MATT: "Safe travels."

608
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:01,620
LAURA: You, as well.

609
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,504
MATT: The ship continues making its way southward,
turning around slowly to start turning more

610
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:15,395
northeast direction. You guys watch as you see the
ship go overhead from the island, heading in the

611
00:47:15,395 --> 00:47:21,110
opposite direction of Ank'Harel. Eventually, 
Vex makes her way back to your location

612
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,804
on the island.

613
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:27,865
SAM: How'd it go with Damon?

614
00:47:27,865 --> 00:47:31,919
LAURA: We're getting married. It's wonderful.

615
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,082
SAM: I knew it!

616
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:35,945
LAURA: They're heading to Whitestone.

617
00:47:35,945 --> 00:47:41,600
SAM: Aren't we not supposed to tell anybody about
Whitestone? Didn't we have some blood pact,

618
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,622
don't ever say the word Whitestone?

619
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:44,580
LAURA: We did.

620
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,234
SAM: Also, isn't it invisible?

621
00:47:46,234 --> 00:47:47,396
LAURA: It is.

622
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:51,039
SAM: Great. All right, well, maybe they'll find
it, anyway.

623
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:53,599
TRAVIS: Shall we?

624
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:56,895
LIAM: Can you do the thing, Scan-man?

625
00:47:56,895 --> 00:47:59,625
SAM: Sure. I'll house it up.

626
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:10,915
MATT: Okay. As you summon Scanlan's Magnificent
Mansion, you all come to a familiar space,

627
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:19,388
spectral servants waiting to wait on you. But the
somber atmosphere still remains. You find your way

628
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:22,716
to your respective rooms, and if there's anything
you'd like to do before the evening's rest,

629
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,752
now's the time to speak up.

630
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:31,222
LIAM: Hey, just an idea. Everybody remembers when
they were kids putting blankets out in the living

631
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:38,851
room and sleeping. I don't really want to go back
to my room. Want to camp out in the den together?

632
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:41,117
MARISHA: Yeah, we can make a blanket fort.

633
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:43,595
SAM: Sounds good.

634
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:50,646
LAURA: Didn't you ever have blanket forts, Grog?

635
00:48:50,646 --> 00:48:52,004
TRAVIS: I didn't have blankets.

636
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:54,278
LAURA: We'll show you how it's done.

637
00:48:55,228 --> 00:48:56,401
TRAVIS: Fine.

638
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,567
LIAM: Where do we put Percival?

639
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:04,954
TRAVIS: With us.

640
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:07,608
SAM: Yeah. We're still a team.

641
00:49:08,518 --> 00:49:10,462
MARISHA: That sounds a little weird, you guys.

642
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:14,325
SAM: Well, we're not going to let him sleep alone.

643
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:28,535
We'll put him on a table, and we'll all sleep
around him on the floor. It'll be super weird.

644
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:40,311
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding, and I
take out one of the ten expensive-ass bottles of

645
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:47,595
wine. I take out two of them. I de-cork two. 
I hand one to Vex and one to Keyleth and say:

646
00:49:47,595 --> 00:49:54,117
It'll be a hard night, but you both have to sleep.
Drink this, and we will attempt to remedy this

647
00:49:54,117 --> 00:50:01,491
when we wake. The best thing you can do 
for your friend now is to sleep, so do that.

648
00:50:03,071 --> 00:50:04,999
Save your tears for later.

649
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:08,805
MARISHA: Keyleth also pulls a Vex.

650
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,623
MATT: All right.

651
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:22,243
MARISHA: I take out the dagger and I hand it to
Vex-- to Vax, sorry.

652
00:50:22,243 --> 00:50:26,121
LAURA: Thank you, you already said it. 
You said it's mine. It's mine.

653
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:34,644
I take one of the blankets, and I cover up Percy.

654
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:43,357
MATT: You take that and cover him up and put him
currently to rest on the ground.

655
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,171
Kynan is still by the door.

656
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:54,937
LIAM: Come here. Two things. One, there's blue
people all over the place in here.

657
00:50:54,937 --> 00:50:56,917
Don't pay them any mind.

658
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:57,967
MATT: "Yeah."

659
00:50:57,967 --> 00:51:04,077
LIAM: Stay in the room, but give us a little bit
of space.

660
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:05,653
MATT: "Of course."

661
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:24,323
LIAM: Hey. We'll work it out. Have faith.

662
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:31,986
MATT: He doesn't say anything.

663
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:33,499
LIAM: I go back to the group.

664
00:51:33,499 --> 00:51:35,640
TRAVIS: And we sleep.

665
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:43,630
MARISHA: I Druidcraft little fireflies above us.
Make it all pretty, and sleep, too.

666
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:52,503
MATT: You guys take an evening's rest within the
mansion. You recover half of your hit die.

667
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:58,122
Whatever your maximum hit die is, you recover half
that for the evening's rest. You're at full hit

668
00:51:58,122 --> 00:52:00,405
points, and your spells are returned to you.

669
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:04,448
TRAVIS: What?

670
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:05,941
LAURA: We're normal again.

671
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:07,840
LIAM: Well, that's debatable.

672
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,458
MATT: Grog is at level 15, so you would get back
eight of your hit dice that you've spent.

673
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:18,833
LAURA: (sing-song) Morning comes.

674
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:36,793
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

675
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:42,224
SAM: Well, we're recovered. How'd you guys sleep?
Everyone sleep okay? Not great.

676
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:46,164
LAURA: Can we Tree Stride, Keyleth? Can we go?

677
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,775
MARISHA: Yes, let's go.

678
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:54,975
MATT: As you guys make your way to the front door,
you see Kynan is leaning against the wall of the

679
00:52:54,975 --> 00:53:03,067
front, his knees pushed to his chest. He hasn't
slept. He has big bags under his eyes.

680
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:05,994
He's just staring at the floor.

681
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:11,579
TRAVIS: Kynan, is it? Do me a favor. Sulk around
this group a little bit later. Otherwise, I might

682
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:17,222
kill you right now. So fall in line and pick your
chin up.

683
00:53:17,222 --> 00:53:24,061
MATT: He's not reacting.

684
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:25,739
LAURA: I give him some water.

685
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:32,054
MATT: He acknowledges as you place it down. 
He doesn't drink any of it.

686
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:35,368
LAURA: You should get up. We're leaving.

687
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:37,504
MARISHA: Are we bringing him with us?

688
00:53:37,504 --> 00:53:38,729
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

689
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:46,799
MATT: He stands up slowly and just follows you
like a ghost right now. What's the plan?

690
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:48,730
SAM: Got to find a tree.

691
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,052
LAURA: Go to tree. Go to Sun Tree.

692
00:53:51,052 --> 00:53:52,876
SAM: Where we going?

693
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,612
LAURA and TRAVIS: Whitestone.

694
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:56,063
SAM: Okay.

695
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:59,059
MARISHA: Closest, biggest, fattest tree.

696
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:03,304
MATT: It doesn't take you long. You've seen a few
that'll work in your initial travel into the

697
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:10,812
jungle here. You find one thick jungle tree that's
probably 35 feet up, slightly curving at the top,

698
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:17,059
one of the few living trees in this forest. It's a
nice wide solid trunk, so it's perfect for you to

699
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:23,800
do this. As you all gather around, making sure you
have everything you need, Keyleth, you reach out,

700
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,638
touch, and mark the space where the doorway is to
open. As you finish the casting of your spell, the

701
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:36,283
bark of this striated palm tree-type structure
falls away into the entrance. On the other side,

702
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:42,493
you can see that brief, hazy glimmer of a
cloud-covered day at Whitestone. You all quickly

703
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:47,853
rush through, one after another. Portal closes
behind as you all stand now leaping outside of the

704
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:59,873
Sun Tree in the center of the main town square in
Whitestone. It is getting close to...

705
00:54:59,873 --> 00:55:07,597
The sun is setting. It's later in the afternoon, 
evening.

706
00:55:15,193 --> 00:55:18,583
LAURA: Do we see anyone around? We get Pike. 
We go to Pike.

707
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,684
MARISHA: Pike immediately.

708
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,997
MATT: All right. There is still that faint shimmer
on the sky above you.

709
00:55:23,997 --> 00:55:27,042
TRAVIS: I have Percy over my shoulders, fireman
carry.

710
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,960
MATT: As you guys arrive, a number of people who
live in Whitestone--

711
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,704
LAURA: What?

712
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:40,938
TRAVIS: Yeah, around my shoulders. Yeah. No.
Fireman carry.

713
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:47,465
MATT: As you guys begin walking away from the Sun
Tree, you can see a bunch of townsfolk and some

714
00:55:47,465 --> 00:55:55,174
guards begin to walk up to greet you, and be like,
"You've returned--" Immediately, the energy is

715
00:55:55,174 --> 00:56:01,313
felt and everyone steps away and gives you space
as people begin to see the limp body of Percival

716
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:05,037
being held over Grog's shoulder.

717
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:07,884
LAURA: Someone should get Cassandra.

718
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:13,641
MARISHA: Immediately. Tell them we're coming. To
prepare quarters.

719
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:20,773
MATT: "Right away." The guard rushes off up
towards the Castle Whitestone. Are you guys

720
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:22,503
walking towards the Castle Whitestone, as well?

721
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:23,754
SAM: That's where Pike is, right?

722
00:56:23,754 --> 00:56:25,913
LAURA: Is she building a temple here?

723
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:27,465
MATT: There is a temple being built here, yes.

724
00:56:27,465 --> 00:56:28,693
SAM: In the castle?

725
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:32,385
MATT: No. The temple would be within the city
itself.

726
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:34,856
SAM: And that's where she was last seen?

727
00:56:34,856 --> 00:56:37,565
LAURA: Can we try the earrings? Does Pike have her
earring?

728
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:38,688
MARISHA: Yeah, she's got to have her earring,
right?

729
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,365
LAURA: Pike, can you hear us?

730
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:51,813
MATT: Pike, you who have been suffering a very
sleepless night, feeling some amorphous heartbreak

731
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:57,775
that you haven't been able to define yet that has
prevented you from closing eyes without spells of

732
00:56:57,775 --> 00:57:06,193
sudden anxiety and sadness, hear the voice come
peeking through, and the immediacy of Vex's tone

733
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:12,741
is both comforting and immediately confirming a
terrible fright that you've had lingering at the

734
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:14,148
back of your mind.

735
00:57:14,148 --> 00:57:16,316
ASHLEY: Vex?

736
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:18,181
LAURA: Where are you, darling?

737
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:22,269
ASHLEY: I'm in the temple. Where are you? I know
something's wrong.

738
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:23,777
LAURA: (tearfully) We're coming to find you.

739
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:29,458
ASHLEY: Okay.

740
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,564
MARISHA: To Sarenrae's temple.

741
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:36,541
MATT: You guys beeline there. The temple is still
under construction, and construction's been slow

742
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:41,122
due to the scenario that currently exists on
Tal'Dorei. Many folks instead are putting a lot of

743
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:48,665
energy toward defenses and training in case
anything bad happens in Whitestone. There are a

744
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:52,525
few worshipers that have converted to Sarenrae and
are helping, but Pike is still the central place

745
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:56,582
of what is a basic stone structure that is slowly
being outfitted.

746
00:57:56,582 --> 00:58:05,356
As you approach, it's pretty much a hovel, but is
making its way. As you approach, you can see the

747
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:16,952
front door open, and there Pike's form, long
silver- and gold-colored evening wear, her hair

748
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,498
tousled around her face, the little bit of wind
that's blowing through causing it to tumble

749
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:26,024
against one chin. She looks out the rest of you
with sadness across her eyes.

750
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:34,533
ASHLEY: I knew something was wrong. Where is he?

751
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:36,636
LAURA: We bring him inside.

752
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:41,746
MATT: You all make your way into this room. There
are two other people that are helping around.

753
00:58:41,746 --> 00:58:48,891
They're general townsfolk. They're not heavy 
into any specific use aside from cleaning and

754
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:55,410
helping construct. But they bring a large table 
out, and you guys set Percy on top of it.

755
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:00,001
LAURA: Pike, can you do something? Can you help
him?

756
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:02,259
ASHLEY: I'm going to try.

757
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:04,867
TRAVIS: We're here with you, Pike.

758
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:08,538
MARISHA: Whatever we can do to help. We just knew
we couldn't do this without you.

759
00:59:08,538 --> 00:59:16,361
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast Resurrection on
him.

760
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:23,098
SAM: Resurrection? What does that do? Does it just
bring him back?

761
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:24,707
LAURA: Does Resurrection just bring him back?

762
00:59:24,707 --> 00:59:34,287
MATT: There are two spells at your disposal. There
is Resurrection, which is a 7th-level spell. It

763
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:41,105
costs a diamond worth 1,000 gold, which the spell
consumes. Or there is Raise Dead, which is a

764
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:47,538
5th-level spell, which consumes a diamond worth
500 gold pieces, but the target has to have been

765
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:49,550
dead no longer than ten days.

766
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:53,049
LAURA: Okay, so we could do that. What does
Resurrection do?

767
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:56,002
MATT: The same thing, but the person could have
been dead for up to a century.

768
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:57,879
MARISHA: Is there a better chance with
Resurrection?

769
00:59:57,879 --> 01:00:06,838
MATT: I would say, being a 7th-level spell, I
would give a very faint modifier, depending.

770
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:10,560
SAM: I don't know, Vex. We could save 500 gold.

771
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,995
LAURA: I bring out the best diamond I have.

772
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:14,715
MATT: Okay.

773
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:18,997
LAURA: I got a whole 40-pound bag of gems.

774
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:21,419
SAM: What was that, Ash?

775
01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:31,770
ASHLEY: With Raise Dead, is there-- (sighs) what
is my question? How whole does he come back?

776
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:37,086
MATT: Whole. With both spells, he comes back
whole. If it works.

777
01:00:37,086 --> 01:00:38,872
ASHLEY: Well, we could save a little money.

778
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:41,382
(laughter)

779
01:00:41,382 --> 01:00:43,371
SAM: No, Pike, no!

780
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:48,386
TRAVIS: Oh, how grief does strange things to
people!

781
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:52,484
SAM: Or we could buy him a better tombstone if we
had the extra money!

782
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:55,116
LAURA: That's terrible, Scanlan!

783
01:00:55,116 --> 01:00:57,967
ASHLEY: His glasses are broken. We could fix his
glasses.

784
01:00:57,967 --> 01:00:59,921
LAURA: Yeah.

785
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:06,488
LIAM: This is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III. He needs a large-ass

786
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:09,336
diamond. Pull out the biggest one you've got.

787
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:13,028
LAURA: I've got a thousand-dollar diamond. 
It's actually listed in my items.

788
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:16,407
A thousand-gold diamond.

789
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:19,390
ASHLEY: Let's do it. He's a de Rolo. He deserves
the best.

790
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:29,743
MATT: Okay. Pike, you begin to set the stage for
the ritual. You begin to pull out the sage. This

791
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:34,473
temple, as simple as it is, but simple is the
nature of Sarenrae, one who does not have much

792
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:41,122
worshiping influence in this world. You know that
she requires just enough, and the faith is

793
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:45,510
stronger than the presentation, but you pull out
the best you can all the offerings that are

794
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:52,675
necessary. You scrawl out the various divine runic
symbols that represent healing, that represent

795
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:59,895
connection to one's divine entity, that represent
stalwartness and strength of heart, that represent

796
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:06,355
love and family, everything you can think of that
really binds this ritual to the moment. As you

797
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:12,225
guys are sitting around to prepare, you begin the
incantation of the ritual. The first stage allows

798
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:24,134
you to reach out and make contact with the spirit
wherever it is. After five minutes of searching,

799
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:35,758
you have no way of locating it. The spirit,
currently-- something is blocking it.

800
01:02:35,762 --> 01:02:37,838
LAURA: Is it Orthax?

801
01:02:43,808 --> 01:02:53,337
MATT: You know it's out there. You can sense that
there is an essence of Percival, but it's like

802
01:02:53,337 --> 01:03:00,039
it's blurred and there's something blocking it.
The ritual's unable to reach out.

803
01:03:01,892 --> 01:03:06,516
ASHLEY: How do I find out what it is?

804
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:13,862
LAURA: Is there a way to find out what it is
that's blocking it?

805
01:03:13,862 --> 01:03:19,295
MATT: You may have to think about it.

806
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,306
ASHLEY: Insight check, or can I--

807
01:03:22,306 --> 01:03:26,157
LIAM: Religion. It's Orthax.

808
01:03:26,157 --> 01:03:35,382
MARISHA: I pull out Ripley's gun, and I hand it to
Pike while she's still in her ritual, and see if

809
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:37,965
that has any effect.

810
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:48,990
MATT: As Keyleth hands you the gun, that strange
blockage becomes crystalline. What was once a dark

811
01:03:48,990 --> 01:04:00,014
spot that was preventing you from clarifying your
vision is now a clear patch of shadow. Having seen

812
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:08,924
this once before, Orthax is indeed blocking the
ritual and is currently hungrily feasting on the

813
01:04:08,924 --> 01:04:10,517
soul of Percival.

814
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:13,117
SAM: In the gun?

815
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,997
LAURA: How do we draw him out?

816
01:04:15,997 --> 01:04:19,163
MARISHA: Do we try and destroy the gun again? 
Do we do this again?

817
01:04:19,163 --> 01:04:22,164
TRAVIS: What if we carve his name back onto the
barrel?

818
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:24,614
LIAM: What if we use that scroll to go to him
now?

819
01:04:24,614 --> 01:04:26,372
SAM: Go to Percy?

820
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:27,604
TRAVIS: Or go to Orthax.

821
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:29,050
LAURA: We can pull Orthax through the gate.

822
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,999
LIAM: Or kill him on his home turf and kill him
for real.

823
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,699
MARISHA: He's a shadow fiend. Does that mean 
we have to kill him on his own turf? Do we know?

824
01:04:38,717 --> 01:04:46,235
MATT: I would say, Pike, make a religion check, 
and make an intelligence check, Scanlan.

825
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:53,426
LIAM: Can I make a religion check?

826
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:55,665
MATT: Actually, yes, you can, as well.

827
01:04:55,665 --> 01:04:57,471
SAM: Check? Just a check?

828
01:04:57,471 --> 01:04:59,280
ASHLEY: 21.

829
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,614
SAM: 11.

830
01:05:03,855 --> 01:05:12,548
MATT: Holding this, the essence of Orthax, a
shadow demon like this. Orthax was not destroyed

831
01:05:12,548 --> 01:05:19,352
and sent back to his plane. Orthax cannot be sent
back to its plane when it's bound to whatever its

832
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:28,089
crux is. Whatever object that Orthax has used as
its focus holds it in this plane and it cannot be

833
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:33,014
destroyed on its plane while it's attached to that
object. The gun right now is essentially the

834
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:35,736
anchor that Orthax is using.

835
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:37,423
LAURA: We need to destroy the gun.

836
01:05:37,423 --> 01:05:40,778
MATT: Destroy the gun or find a way to break the
connection.

837
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:50,184
TRAVIS: Didn't you detach Craven Edge from me?
Didn't you sever a thread? Didn't that happen?

838
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,191
LAURA: Can you reach out? Can you do that?

839
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:53,290
TRAVIS: Yeah!

840
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:58,000
MARISHA: Pike did that, right?

841
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,779
SAM: How'd you do that, Pikey?

842
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:02,195
ASHLEY: I'm trying to remember!

843
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:04,779
TRAVIS: I don't even remember, 
and it happened to me.

844
01:06:04,779 --> 01:06:06,920
SAM: Well, you were dead, weren't you?

845
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,196
TRAVIS: No excuse.

846
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:11,143
MARISHA: Wasn't it a something-evil spell?

847
01:06:11,143 --> 01:06:16,546
SAM: Could we throw the gun into the little hole
under Whitestone Castle?

848
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:17,878
LIAM: There also still acid.

849
01:06:17,878 --> 01:06:24,470
LAURA: Yeah! What if we brought the gun in front 
of the circle? It cancels out the magic of it.

850
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,797
MARISHA: Throw it in the circle?

851
01:06:26,797 --> 01:06:28,728
LAURA: Or just bring in there.

852
01:06:28,728 --> 01:06:32,837
MARISHA: Is it an arcane magic like that?

853
01:06:32,837 --> 01:06:34,645
LAURA: I don't know. We could try.

854
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:36,895
SAM: There is acid. We could do the same exact
thing.

855
01:06:36,895 --> 01:06:38,669
LIAM: And repeat history, Scanlan.

856
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:42,620
ASHLEY: I think it was Greater Restoration.

857
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,452
TRAVIS: That was right. That's what severed it.

858
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:49,941
MATT: You want to try a Greater Restoration spell,
is that what you're saying?

859
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:51,295
SAM: On what?

860
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:53,309
TRAVIS: On the gun.

861
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,569
SAM: Can you do that to an object?

862
01:06:56,569 --> 01:06:59,286
MATT: Yeah, that's what she did for--

863
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:04,857
TRAVIS: She could see a thread 
that was connecting us.

864
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:09,710
MATT: What are you doing, Pike?

865
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:13,282
ASHLEY: To the gun? Is that even going to make 
any sense?

866
01:07:13,282 --> 01:07:17,188
MARISHA: Pike, I can try Greater Restoration, if
you want to save your healing magic.

867
01:07:17,188 --> 01:07:20,770
Do you want me to try it?

868
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,986
ASHLEY: I mean, in case this doesn't work--

869
01:07:22,986 --> 01:07:26,981
MARISHA: I'll try to recreate what Pike did to
Grog.

870
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:35,805
MATT: You take Animus from her, the pepperbox, and
even holding it there is this dark weight to it.

871
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:42,317
It feels like lead and cold in your hands. As you
concentrate, channeling the divine druidic

872
01:07:42,317 --> 01:07:49,979
energies that currently you're focusing into it, 
your vision comes to a similar dark, shadowy

873
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:56,581
mass that Pike had seen during the attempt at the
resurrection ritual. You can see there is indeed a

874
01:07:56,581 --> 01:08:05,581
connection, there is a tangible gateway between
this weapon and Orthax, the shadow demon.

875
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:12,722
There, enveloped in the darkness, you can sense 
in your heart of hearts: that's where Percy lies.

876
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:20,036
As you begin to focus on Greater Restoration, you
begin to feel the nature of the curse that binds

877
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:26,974
him to it. And you reach out in this space. You
guys watch as Keyleth reaches out into the air of

878
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:31,631
nothing, but within your sight and your vision,
you can see that thread, and you grasp it.

879
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:36,346
As you hold it with your fingers, you feel it 
fight. You watch as Keyleth's hand bolts around

880
01:08:36,346 --> 01:08:45,813
with nothing in her grasp. You hear the voice 
whisper, "No! No, I finally have him. I finally--"

881
01:08:45,813 --> 01:08:52,630
And with that, you snap with your fist. 
The shadow screams and vanishes

882
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:59,964
and there you see a brief glimmer of light, 
the remaining spirit of Percival

883
01:08:59,964 --> 01:09:02,907
as it drifts off into the Astral Sea.

884
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:05,849
MARISHA: I scream: Percy!

885
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:12,170
MATT: The spell finishes. The gun itself, you guys
see a flash of shadow around it, and it dulls.

886
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:15,409
All the names on the side vanish as well. 
The barrels are now clean.

887
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:18,485
MARISHA: Pike, do it!

888
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:22,391
ASHLEY: I continue working on the 
Resurrection spell.

889
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:31,318
MATT: Okay. As you go back into this ritual, that
blockage is gone now, and you can see, clear,

890
01:09:31,318 --> 01:09:41,067
the somewhat tattered-around-the-edges, but whole 
and existing soul of Percival. The ritual makes

891
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:48,385
connection, and with that, that coldness becomes a
warmth and a familiarity as you reach out and

892
01:09:48,576 --> 01:09:54,617
implore the spirit to take your attention and come
back.

893
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:58,145
Now, who wants to aid in this resurrection ritual?

894
01:09:58,145 --> 01:10:01,276
Who has something to offer 
as a part of this skill challenge?

895
01:10:01,276 --> 01:10:06,136
SAM: I would like to inspire her, at least. Is
that something that will help?

896
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:12,004
MATT: Inspiring whoever wants to be part of the
ritual, yeah. You can go ahead and inspire.

897
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:20,820
LAURA: Can I reach forward and look in Percy's
coat for that condensed whitestone

898
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,476
that he carries?

899
01:10:22,476 --> 01:10:24,496
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

900
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:29,727
MARISHA: Hey, Vex, will you look for that raven
skull that I gave him while you're at it?

901
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:34,343
LAURA: Sure. 25.

902
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:42,726
MATT: 25. You start rummaging through his coat and
you find his gun, Retort. You find a bunch of

903
01:10:42,726 --> 01:10:47,832
random bullet casings and bullets. You find a
cluster of papers and notes that are folded up in

904
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:54,072
a small book, and what appears to be a partially
sealed letter with no name on it.

905
01:10:54,072 --> 01:10:55,790
LAURA: Nothing else?

906
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:04,735
MATT: You eventually find some of the whitestone
glass, the green glass that you guys had flashed

907
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:07,241
around in Ank'Harel.

908
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:08,792
MARISHA: Does he still have the raven skull on him
that I gave him?

909
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:10,950
MATT: The raven skull is still on him. It hangs
around his neck, yeah.

910
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:14,205
TRAVIS: What is that?

911
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:19,359
LAURA: He says it's supposed to amplify magic.
Right?

912
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,457
SAM: I think.

913
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:25,876
LAURA: So I put it on his chest.

914
01:11:25,876 --> 01:11:33,798
MATT: All right. What do you want to offer to the
skill challenge for this event? Something that you

915
01:11:33,798 --> 01:11:39,232
as an individual bring to this and bring to the
connection to Percy to try and--

916
01:11:39,232 --> 01:11:54,019
LAURA: (shakily) I say: Percy, I don't know if you
can hear me, but that day in Syngorn was one of

917
01:11:54,019 --> 01:12:00,427
the best moments of my life. And not because of
what you think. It wasn't because of my father or

918
01:12:00,427 --> 01:12:10,734
the title. It was because of Whitestone. It was
because of you. You allowed me to be a part of the

919
01:12:10,734 --> 01:12:24,843
thing that you hold dearest. And I was so proud.
But I don't want to be here if you're not.

920
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:37,653
Whitestone still needs you, darling. I still need
you here. And I lean down and I kiss him,

921
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:47,991
and I say, 
I should have told you: it's yours.

922
01:12:47,991 --> 01:12:50,249
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

923
01:12:57,769 --> 01:12:59,351
LAURA: Natural 20!

924
01:13:01,796 --> 01:13:12,059
MATT: I trust you. Okay. Who else wants to add
something to this ritual?

925
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:18,253
SAM: Matt, would I inspire Pike or Percy?

926
01:13:18,253 --> 01:13:22,158
MATT: If you want to inspire Pike, Pike could
attempt to bring something to the ritual and then

927
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:25,247
could use your inspiration die on top of what her
check is.

928
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:34,699
SAM: I see. All right. I'll inspire Pike, then. 
I assume she's going to bring something

929
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:37,586
to the ritual, right? I assume?

930
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:39,607
ASHLEY: Okay.

931
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:40,963
MATT: So how do you inspire?

932
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:46,112
SAM: I inspire her the only way I know how, 
which is being an ass. So I'll inspire her

933
01:13:46,112 --> 01:13:49,689
with a shitty limerick.

934
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:57,267
I know a gunman with a white coif-a
Who acted evil and had a bad cough-a.

935
01:13:57,267 --> 01:14:00,765
He learned that someone
Had possessed his big gun,

936
01:14:00,765 --> 01:14:02,753
So I threw that shit in the lava.

937
01:14:02,753 --> 01:14:04,723
(laughter)

938
01:14:04,723 --> 01:14:10,796
MATT: All right. You have a d12 inspiration die,
Pike. What do you want to try and bring to the

939
01:14:10,796 --> 01:14:20,534
ritual on top of your casting the spell to draw
him back? What do you want to bring

940
01:14:20,534 --> 01:14:21,575
to the ritual?

941
01:14:21,575 --> 01:14:35,475
ASHLEY: I don't know. I mean, the love that we
have for him? I don't know.

942
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:40,101
(tearfully) This is so stressful.

943
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:49,916
MATT: I know. You being the pious woman you are,
what you've used in the past, religion has been

944
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:54,132
optional. Your connection with Sarenrae in this is
important. If there are other skills you can think

945
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:58,811
of that you'd want to bring to this, as well, that
you're good at that would fit this circumstance.

946
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:04,874
You can try anything. How well it fits will depend
on how high the difficulty class is.

947
01:15:04,874 --> 01:15:12,261
ASHLEY: Right. I think, clearly, I would hope that
Sarenrae would come in and step in

948
01:15:12,261 --> 01:15:13,840
and help in this.

949
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:19,420
LAURA: Can you sing? Can you sing, Pike, like you
did for that little boy? Percy joined you then.

950
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,911
ASHLEY: I could.

951
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:28,850
SAM: Didn't you have that thing that brings your
god to help once a day?

952
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,389
LAURA: Divine intervention?

953
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:34,525
ASHLEY: Can I use that along with this?

954
01:15:34,525 --> 01:15:36,616
MATT: I'll let you, yeah.

955
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:39,045
ASHLEY: Well, heck yes.

956
01:15:39,045 --> 01:15:45,359
MATT: All right. Roll a d10. Let me know what you
roll first.

957
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:53,374
ASHLEY: Okay.

958
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:55,987
MATT: What'd you roll?

959
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:57,842
ASHLEY: I rolled a three.

960
01:15:57,842 --> 01:16:03,516
MATT: Okay. Sarenrae is with you, but the
intervention, the Divine Gate that separates the

961
01:16:03,516 --> 01:16:10,987
gods from the Prime Material Plane still stands.
She's lending what energy she can in this moment.

962
01:16:11,092 --> 01:16:16,192
Imploring to her and the connection you do have
through the Divine Gate, I want you to go ahead

963
01:16:16,192 --> 01:16:19,334
and make a religion check. Roll a d20 and add your
religion modifier.

964
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:27,857
ASHLEY: Come on. 18?

965
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:31,522
MATT: Okay. Do you want to add your d12
inspiration from Scanlan?

966
01:16:31,522 --> 01:16:41,770
ASHLEY: Yes. That's ten. An extra ten, so what did
I say? 28.

967
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:50,688
MATT: All right, gotcha. One final skill challenge
check to make. Who wishes to add to this?

968
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:54,177
LIAM: I have a notion, but you are very close to
him.

969
01:16:54,177 --> 01:17:09,658
MARISHA: I grab the skull from around his neck
that I gave him. I say: Percy, we had many

970
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:22,956
conversations about life and death, and in many
ways, you were my total opposite. But you are also

971
01:17:22,956 --> 01:17:39,242
my best friend. Even though I told you that day
that I gave you this that we're all going to die

972
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:46,854
and that you can still be saved from yourself, it
was clear the journey was far from over, and it

973
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:53,355
still isn't. And then I'm going to cast Conjure
Woodland Beings, and I'm going to have a barrage

974
01:17:53,355 --> 01:18:06,777
of crows come from around me. I'm going to tell
him: As much as you might think your journey is

975
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:19,052
over, just because yours might be, ours isn't. And
we need you. And I need you.

976
01:18:19,052 --> 01:18:30,659
LIAM: I kneel at his head and shoot out the wings
and lend them to Percival like the crow he is.

977
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:34,399
Like a cloak.

978
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:43,018
MATT: I'm going to say between the two of you on
that, I need you to make a charisma ability check.

979
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:52,559
With advantage because of Vax helping you. This is
in particular a challenge for you because

980
01:18:52,559 --> 01:18:57,060
persuasion's already been used. You as your point
of leadership and strength of character, you're

981
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:01,631
piercing through the veil and through the ritual
to appeal to him as a person to another through

982
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:10,151
sheer force of charismatic persuasion. With
advantage. Adding your charisma bonus.

983
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:27,494
MARISHA: Use the gold die. Percy. 19.

984
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:37,171
MATT: 19. You feel, Pike, the ritual begin to
culminate. The divine energies lent to you by

985
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:45,005
Sarenrae fill your form, and you watch as Pike's
physical form now seems to overlap her divine form

986
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:50,849
you've had at a distance. She is this radiant
golden image of herself, the same golden wings

987
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:56,628
flaring up around her. You watch as Percy's body
begins to rise off the table, the arms and legs

988
01:19:56,628 --> 01:20:03,820
limply hanging underneath, the chest rising up.
The light from Pike begins to create a small well

989
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:09,208
of divine energy that spirals down into his chest
and blasts through him and the table. The table

990
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:12,529
itself cracks beneath him, yet he still remains
aloft as the energy hits.

991
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:33,004
The energy fades. The ritual completes. The room
grows still and cold and dark once more. Pike's

992
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:40,024
divine form disperses into golden feathers that
drift and disappear across the wooden floor.

993
01:20:40,024 --> 01:20:58,156
Percy's body slowly lands onto the table.
Stillness. Stillness.

994
01:20:58,156 --> 01:21:03,897
(inhalation) Breaths begin

995
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:13,983
to fill his chest once more. Unconscious as he is,
life is slowly returning to Percival, as is color.

996
01:21:14,025 --> 01:21:20,911
His pale skin pale as it's ever been, but now
slowly stirring.

997
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,951
ASHLEY: (sighs with relief)

998
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:27,883
LAURA: (laughs) Pike!

999
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,805
MATT: I'll take a picture of that just so everyone
knows.

1000
01:21:30,805 --> 01:21:38,447
LAURA: Taliesin, get your butt in here!

1001
01:21:38,447 --> 01:21:42,017
SAM: He's so quiet. We should just let him sleep.

1002
01:21:42,017 --> 01:21:47,715
ASHLEY: This is too fucking much, man.

1003
01:21:47,715 --> 01:21:52,078
SAM: Pike, you're in a temple! Don't curse.

1004
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:54,118
ASHLEY: I don't care.

1005
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,845
LAURA: Percy?

1006
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,932
MARISHA: You said he's still unconscious?

1007
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:01,379
MATT: Still unconscious.

1008
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:08,712
LIAM: Oh. Well, I cast Lay on Hands and take him
out of that, right away. Ten hit points.

1009
01:22:08,712 --> 01:22:12,608
MATT: Percival! Get back in your chair.

1010
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:15,161
TRAVIS: Get your monkey ass back in that chair!

1011
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:20,349
SAM: But--

1012
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:25,001
TALIESIN: I've been watching South Park. I don't
know about the rest of you.

1013
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:27,298
LIAM: No Hamlet death for you!

1014
01:22:27,298 --> 01:22:30,990
MATT: Let me tweet out the photo real fast.

1015
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:38,163
LAURA: I feel like we need to take a break. Can we
take our break? I'm going to throw up.

1016
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:43,416
MATT: Actually, this would be a great time to go
ahead and take a break. We're going to go ahead

1017
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:45,389
and go take a quick break.

1018
01:22:45,389 --> 01:22:46,769
LAURA: Good job, Ashley!

1019
01:22:46,769 --> 01:22:50,540
SAM: Ashley, you did it! You have one job, Ashley!
One job!

1020
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,376
TALIESIN: Two jobs.

1021
01:22:52,376 --> 01:23:01,916
MATT: Those were some good rolls, man, and
apparently a convincing-- I was literally waiting

1022
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:06,685
for a text from Taliesin to let me know, based on
how the ritual went, whether or not Percival felt

1023
01:23:06,685 --> 01:23:09,662
it was enough to bring him back, even if it would
have succeeded.

1024
01:23:09,662 --> 01:23:12,146
TALIESIN: You guys could have fucked it up so bad.
It would have been great.

1025
01:23:12,146 --> 01:23:15,410
MATT: We'll be back here in a number of minutes.

1026
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:19,701
MARISHA: (hoarsely) Did we say the right thing?
Clearly?

1027
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:23,717
TALIESIN: I'll tell you when the camera's off.

1028
01:23:23,717 --> 01:23:26,607
LIAM: Listen, all we know is half the audience is
going to be furious.

1029
01:23:26,607 --> 01:23:28,631
(laughter)

1030
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:31,420
MATT: All right, guys. We'll see you here in a few
minutes.

1031
01:23:31,420 --> 01:36:33,784
[break]

1032
01:36:33,784 --> 01:36:39,056
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Diving right
back in.

1033
01:36:39,056 --> 01:36:46,875
Percival, freshly breathing on the table in the
partially constructed small temple to Sarenrae in

1034
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:54,847
the city of Whitestone, apparently successful, his
spirit restored. You come to consciousness as a

1035
01:36:54,847 --> 01:36:56,862
tiny hand is smacking you in the face.

1036
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:59,296
SAM: It's like that little doll hand on SNL.

1037
01:36:59,296 --> 01:37:02,942
TALIESIN: Can I use my missile grab again?

1038
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,275
MATT: Yes, you can.

1039
01:37:04,275 --> 01:37:06,145
TALIESIN: I do not open my eyes.

1040
01:37:06,145 --> 01:37:08,577
SAM: He's awake! He's alive! Ow!

1041
01:37:08,577 --> 01:37:10,875
TALIESIN: And I slap him in the face.

1042
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:15,454
MARISHA: His reflexes are working. His reflexes
are working great.

1043
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,136
TALIESIN: (gasping)

1044
01:37:17,136 --> 01:37:21,193
LAURA: Welcome back.

1045
01:37:21,193 --> 01:37:25,392
TALIESIN: (hoarsely) Where are we?

1046
01:37:25,392 --> 01:37:29,295
SAM: Your home. Our home.

1047
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:32,193
LAURA: Oh shit. Can you see? Are his glasses
broken?

1048
01:37:32,193 --> 01:37:34,462
MATT: His glasses are cracked.

1049
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:45,510
TALIESIN: But I can see fine. I'm nearsighted. 
I don't feel well.

1050
01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:47,637
LIAM: You want to feel better?

1051
01:37:47,637 --> 01:37:48,700
TALIESIN: Yes.

1052
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,506
LIAM: Ripley is dead.

1053
01:37:50,506 --> 01:37:52,277
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1054
01:37:52,277 --> 01:37:56,154
SAM: Deader than dead. She's torn asunder. We have
parts of her.

1055
01:37:56,154 --> 01:38:10,300
TALIESIN: That's good news. There's only one part
we need. Well, two.

1056
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,649
SAM: Two?

1057
01:38:11,649 --> 01:38:13,951
TALIESIN: Did we keep both her hands?

1058
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:15,094
LAURA: We did!

1059
01:38:15,094 --> 01:38:17,322
SAM: I thought one was a fake.

1060
01:38:17,322 --> 01:38:18,935
TALIESIN: I'd like to see it.

1061
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:21,956
SAM: Okay. All right. That's a weird request when
you just wake up.

1062
01:38:21,956 --> 01:38:23,964
TALIESIN: Not now.

1063
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,556
LIAM: Yeah, your sister's going to be running up
in here very soon.

1064
01:38:26,556 --> 01:38:28,915
TALIESIN: Oh god, no. I'm going to lie back down.

1065
01:38:28,915 --> 01:38:36,636
MATT: At which point, the door slams open and
Cassandra's there with what appears to be Seeker

1066
01:38:36,636 --> 01:38:41,891
Asum and a couple of the guards from Whitestone.
"Where is he? Is he all right?"

1067
01:38:41,891 --> 01:38:43,376
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw up.

1068
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,827
MATT: "Oh, he's all right."

1069
01:38:44,827 --> 01:38:46,563
(laughter)

1070
01:38:46,563 --> 01:38:48,131
MATT: "You scared me. I heard he was--"

1071
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,144
LAURA: Everything's fine, dear.

1072
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:57,477
MATT: She walks up to you at the table and leans
over and, "Stop getting into trouble, brother.

1073
01:38:57,477 --> 01:38:58,838
"Please?"

1074
01:38:58,838 --> 01:39:09,361
TALIESIN: Well, just a few more dragons and I'll
take a break. It'll be fine. I'm tired.

1075
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:13,201
MATT: She runs her fingers through your hair a
couple of times and looks down. Her stern

1076
01:39:13,201 --> 01:39:21,928
expression melts into a warmth and appreciation.
And she feels the coldness of the body and goes--

1077
01:39:21,928 --> 01:39:29,963
You can see her putting together the setup, the
ritual, your emotional state and the damp cheeks.

1078
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:36,366
She looks over towards you, Pike, and nods and
says, "Thank you."

1079
01:39:36,366 --> 01:39:39,156
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

1080
01:39:39,156 --> 01:39:42,331
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily)

1081
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:46,326
MATT: "Get some food in you and stop being so
bloody useless," and slaps you upside the face and

1082
01:39:46,326 --> 01:39:49,164
turns around and leaves the temple.

1083
01:39:49,164 --> 01:39:54,733
TALIESIN: If everybody had just slapped my face
while I was dead, that would have been so much

1084
01:39:54,733 --> 01:39:56,176
more convenient.

1085
01:39:56,176 --> 01:39:57,840
LAURA: Who says we didn't?

1086
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,793
LIAM: That wasn't the worst of it.

1087
01:40:00,793 --> 01:40:06,145
TALIESIN: No, it was really not. I am very tired.

1088
01:40:06,145 --> 01:40:12,136
SAM: Well, you spent last night on a table, which
is much beneath a man of your station.

1089
01:40:12,136 --> 01:40:18,154
MARISHA: Percy, you were gone for quite a while.

1090
01:40:18,154 --> 01:40:20,046
TALIESIN: How long?

1091
01:40:20,046 --> 01:40:21,583
LAURA: A day.

1092
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:23,554
TALIESIN: Only a day?

1093
01:40:23,554 --> 01:40:24,790
SAM: Yeah.

1094
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:26,686
MARISHA: How long did it feel?

1095
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:28,116
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1096
01:40:28,116 --> 01:40:30,152
TRAVIS: What do you remember?

1097
01:40:30,152 --> 01:40:32,846
TALIESIN: Nothing worth repeating.

1098
01:40:32,846 --> 01:40:34,791
MARISHA: I beg to differ.

1099
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:41,773
SAM: I wanted to use a Gate spell to save you
instantly, but everyone else in the group said no.

1100
01:40:41,773 --> 01:40:43,681
They wanted to save it for something else.

1101
01:40:43,681 --> 01:40:47,598
(laughter)

1102
01:40:47,598 --> 01:40:56,710
SAM: I stood up for you when you were down, and
they turned their backs on you. I give him a big

1103
01:40:56,710 --> 01:41:02,865
hug, and I say: I think that entitles me to one of
the guns that we found. Just one of them.

1104
01:41:02,865 --> 01:41:05,924
The smallest one. You can teach me how to use it 
on weekends.

1105
01:41:05,924 --> 01:41:11,933
TALIESIN: We'll discuss this.

1106
01:41:11,933 --> 01:41:14,562
SAM: It's a hard yes I'm expecting.

1107
01:41:14,562 --> 01:41:19,268
(laughter)

1108
01:41:19,268 --> 01:41:22,593
LIAM: Laughter. Laughter's back.

1109
01:41:22,593 --> 01:41:37,007
TALIESIN: It was not pleasant. Thank you. 
Thank you for what you did.

1110
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,926
MARISHA: What?

1111
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,438
TALIESIN: I saw what you did.

1112
01:41:40,438 --> 01:41:42,294
MARISHA: What do you mean you saw what I did?

1113
01:41:42,294 --> 01:41:45,227
TALIESIN: It was the only thing I saw.

1114
01:41:45,227 --> 01:41:47,527
MARISHA: Did you hear me yell for you?

1115
01:41:47,527 --> 01:41:54,854
TALIESIN: No, but I saw your hand. 
Thank you. (sighs)

1116
01:41:54,854 --> 01:41:56,487
MARISHA: Percy.

1117
01:41:56,487 --> 01:42:01,976
TALIESIN: Yes? I'm glad that that's not waiting
for me any more.

1118
01:42:01,976 --> 01:42:04,664
MARISHA: Are you sure?

1119
01:42:04,664 --> 01:42:06,156
LAURA: Is he gone?

1120
01:42:06,156 --> 01:42:07,946
MARISHA: Do you still feel him?

1121
01:42:07,946 --> 01:42:18,360
TALIESIN: I haven't felt him in a long time. I
stopped feeling him after you did what you did.

1122
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:33,000
And then there was nothing, and then I was here.
But in between, I did feel him, quite a bit.

1123
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,243
I'd rather not think about it at the moment.

1124
01:42:37,243 --> 01:42:42,186
MARISHA: You should rest and get better.

1125
01:42:42,186 --> 01:42:43,898
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to rest.

1126
01:42:43,898 --> 01:42:47,684
LIAM: Bedtime, Percy.

1127
01:42:47,684 --> 01:42:49,370
TALIESIN: Hello, Pike!

1128
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,025
ASHLEY: Hi!

1129
01:42:51,025 --> 01:42:55,566
TALIESIN: I don't suppose you've had time to read
any of those books.

1130
01:42:55,566 --> 01:43:06,731
ASHLEY: I've read all of them. Just all of them.
I've had lots of time on my hands.

1131
01:43:06,731 --> 01:43:08,917
TRAVIS: I want to insight-check Pike.

1132
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:11,458
(laughter)

1133
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:13,599
MATT: Roll an insight check. Pike, roll a
deception check.

1134
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:18,055
ASHLEY: Yes! Here we go!

1135
01:43:18,055 --> 01:43:20,747
MATT: What'd you roll?

1136
01:43:20,747 --> 01:43:22,250
TRAVIS: 11.

1137
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,558
ASHLEY: All right.

1138
01:43:23,558 --> 01:43:26,098
MATT: Pike, what'd you roll a deception check?

1139
01:43:26,098 --> 01:43:28,548
ASHLEY: (laughs) Four.

1140
01:43:28,548 --> 01:43:31,331
(laughter)

1141
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:33,377
MATT: She's lying through her fucking teeth,
Grog.

1142
01:43:33,377 --> 01:43:35,060
TRAVIS: Pike!

1143
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:39,245
ASHLEY: Hey, it was a joke! Trying to make
everyone laugh?

1144
01:43:39,245 --> 01:43:42,899
TALIESIN: You just lied to me. I'm so proud of
you.

1145
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:44,756
ASHLEY: I'm learning.

1146
01:43:44,756 --> 01:43:47,124
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

1147
01:43:47,124 --> 01:43:49,387
TRAVIS: That was very clever, Pike.

1148
01:43:49,387 --> 01:43:51,562
TALIESIN: You should do that more often.

1149
01:43:51,562 --> 01:43:53,421
ASHLEY: I give Percy a big hug.

1150
01:43:53,421 --> 01:43:54,991
TALIESIN: (groans)

1151
01:43:54,991 --> 01:43:57,478
ASHLEY: Please don't do that again?

1152
01:43:57,478 --> 01:44:03,950
TALIESIN: I can make no promises. Oh, that hurts.
Hi.

1153
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:06,560
TRAVIS: Did you thank her for the necklace?

1154
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,482
TALIESIN: Thank you for the necklace. That was--

1155
01:44:10,482 --> 01:44:17,328
ASHLEY: Not enough?

1156
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:27,945
TALIESIN: No, apparently just enough, because here
we are, and she's been dealt with. So it was just

1157
01:44:27,945 --> 01:44:34,408
enough. (sighs) I'm very tired.

1158
01:44:34,408 --> 01:44:38,070
MARISHA: You should sleep, and we'll talk more
tomorrow.

1159
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:40,684
TALIESIN: I'm going to not sleep in here, wherever
this is.

1160
01:44:40,684 --> 01:44:43,509
MARISHA: No, this is still a construction zone.

1161
01:44:43,509 --> 01:44:45,728
TALIESIN: Is this what you've been building?

1162
01:44:45,728 --> 01:44:52,649
ASHLEY: Yes. I know, it still needs some work.
It's not very cozy yet, but it's coming around.

1163
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:58,455
TALIESIN: I don't know if cozy is really the
point. I'm going to lie down somewhere soft.

1164
01:44:58,455 --> 01:45:02,158
TRAVIS: We should all go back to the castle,
then.

1165
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:10,103
MARISHA: I'll go dump a few healing spells and
stuff into him. Let's get you to lie down first.

1166
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:14,526
MATT: So you go and heal him up. You guys make
your way back to the castle. The guards are there

1167
01:45:14,526 --> 01:45:27,620
waiting. As you enter, you can see there, sitting
in the foyer, talking and discussing, is Jarett

1168
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:33,454
and Gilmore, who both look a little nervous and
intense about apparently recently hearing what

1169
01:45:33,454 --> 01:45:41,487
happened. As soon as you enter, Gilmore turns. "I
take that as a good sign. He's standing."

1170
01:45:41,487 --> 01:45:46,285
TALIESIN: I am literally using my gun as a
crutch.

1171
01:45:46,285 --> 01:45:52,877
MATT: "Oh, come here, you white-haired fool!" Then
he runs forward and lifts you up with a hug that

1172
01:45:52,877 --> 01:45:59,464
hurts so much. He holds you up for a second and
sets you back down. "I know that hurt."

1173
01:45:59,464 --> 01:46:02,431
(laughter)

1174
01:46:02,431 --> 01:46:07,319
MATT: "And what did we learn? Don't get killed
again!"

1175
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:14,831
TALIESIN: Third time's the charm, in theory.
Should we show them what we got?

1176
01:46:14,831 --> 01:46:17,650
SAM: What do we have?

1177
01:46:17,650 --> 01:46:20,591
MARISHA: You heal 48 hit points, by the way.

1178
01:46:20,591 --> 01:46:22,819
TALIESIN: Thank you. I don't even know what hit
point level I'm at.

1179
01:46:22,819 --> 01:46:24,191
MATT: You'd be at one.

1180
01:46:24,191 --> 01:46:25,685
TALIESIN: I'm at 49.

1181
01:46:25,685 --> 01:46:32,969
LAURA: What do we have to show them?

1182
01:46:32,969 --> 01:46:34,912
TRAVIS: We have two Vestiges to show them.

1183
01:46:34,912 --> 01:46:38,311
LAURA: Oh shit, I haven't even looked at the
cloak. I tucked it away.

1184
01:46:38,311 --> 01:46:40,173
TALIESIN: We have two Vestiges.

1185
01:46:40,173 --> 01:46:42,101
LAURA: I pull out the cloak.

1186
01:46:42,101 --> 01:46:43,361
MATT: Okay.

1187
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:45,166
SAM: Get it identified.

1188
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:54,274
MATT: Gilmore goes, "I see you've also been prolific.
Here, let me have a look." He takes the cloak and

1189
01:46:54,274 --> 01:47:01,246
folding it over his hands, you see the sparkle of
energy through the blue inside of it. He's like,

1190
01:47:01,246 --> 01:47:10,944
"Very interesting." He puts his hand over it, and
his eyes flare with arcane energy. "This is indeed

1191
01:47:10,944 --> 01:47:21,045
"Cabal's Ruin, one of the Vestiges of Divergence.
Well, to be specific about this: once attuned

1192
01:47:21,045 --> 01:47:26,391
"to whoever's wearing it, you have advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical

1193
01:47:26,391 --> 01:47:36,511
"effects, which is pretty badass, if I do say so
myself. Also, when you're hit by some sort of

1194
01:47:36,511 --> 01:47:41,213
"asshole's spell out there, you can use your 
reaction to have the cloak swallow part of it.

1195
01:47:41,213 --> 01:47:46,200
"You halve the damage you take from the spell, 
if there's any damage to be taken,

1196
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:51,052
"and the cloak gains a number of charges equal to 
the spell level of the triggering spell."

1197
01:47:51,052 --> 01:47:54,175
LIAM: All this arcane terminology is fascinating.

1198
01:47:54,175 --> 01:48:00,645
MATT: It's the filter of game rules. You don't get
a Vestige now! You get Whisper, Keyleth.

1199
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:02,743
(laughter)

1200
01:48:02,743 --> 01:48:07,936
MATT: Essentially, what this does is you can use
your reaction to swallow a spell if you're hurt by

1201
01:48:07,936 --> 01:48:11,678
one. Even if you're not hurt by it, you can still
swallow a spell. You can only use it once per

1202
01:48:11,678 --> 01:48:15,000
short rest. But it does half damage to you and--

1203
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,481
(static from Ashley's microphone)

1204
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:22,474
LIAM: Excuse you.

1205
01:48:22,474 --> 01:48:26,386
MATT: It gains a number of charges equal to the
spell level that you absorb. Up to a maximum of

1206
01:48:26,386 --> 01:48:34,247
six charges can be stored in the cloak. So, six
charges. If you have the cloak on and you hit with

1207
01:48:34,247 --> 01:48:40,297
an attack, you can expend any number of charges
from the cloak to deal an additional 1d6 lightning

1208
01:48:40,297 --> 01:48:41,964
damage per charge.

1209
01:48:41,964 --> 01:48:44,951
LAURA: So you could do an additional 6d6 lightning
damage?

1210
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:51,473
MATT: Yeah, onto an attack that you deal with the
cloak. That's what Cabal's Ruin does.

1211
01:48:51,473 --> 01:48:54,005
SAM: Does it have to be a magic user to wear it?

1212
01:48:54,005 --> 01:49:00,451
MATT: No. In fact, it doesn't channel through
spells. It channels through physical attacks.

1213
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,884
MARISHA: Oh, melee attacks.

1214
01:49:01,884 --> 01:49:04,777
MATT: Melee weapon attacks is how 
the enchantment works.

1215
01:49:04,777 --> 01:49:10,041
SAM: Groggy? Percy?

1216
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,928
LAURA: Grog in a cloak?

1217
01:49:11,928 --> 01:49:15,995
LIAM: Percy, you'd look pretty swag in that.

1218
01:49:15,995 --> 01:49:18,283
TALIESIN: I would.

1219
01:49:18,283 --> 01:49:20,437
SAM: But you already have a Vestige.

1220
01:49:20,437 --> 01:49:22,082
TALIESIN: I do?

1221
01:49:22,082 --> 01:49:24,062
SAM: No, Groggy. So does this go to Percy?

1222
01:49:24,062 --> 01:49:28,175
LIAM: Yeah, this is going to David Bowie you up.
You should wear that.

1223
01:49:28,175 --> 01:49:31,998
MARISHA: It was worn by the woman who tried to
kill you. And succeeded.

1224
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:34,712
SAM: That's pretty cool.

1225
01:49:34,712 --> 01:49:36,732
TRAVIS: What about the other Vestige?

1226
01:49:36,732 --> 01:49:40,415
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Whisper.

1227
01:49:40,415 --> 01:49:42,479
LIAM: How are you doing, Shaun?

1228
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,570
MATT: "What do you mean? I'm doing fantastic."

1229
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:47,523
LIAM: How are you holding up?

1230
01:49:47,523 --> 01:49:51,308
MATT: "It's a little rough, but it's okay."
(chuckles) "I'm doing my job just as you are.

1231
01:49:51,308 --> 01:49:55,586
"I mean, you all look tired, exhausted, and
emotionally drained. So do I!

1232
01:49:55,586 --> 01:49:58,247
"So I think we're all doing our part."

1233
01:49:58,247 --> 01:50:00,631
MARISHA: Your parents are lovely, by the way.

1234
01:50:00,631 --> 01:50:03,593
MATT: (chuckles) "Ah, yes."

1235
01:50:03,593 --> 01:50:05,354
MARISHA: Thank you so much again.

1236
01:50:05,354 --> 01:50:07,192
TRAVIS: We gave them a bunch of water.

1237
01:50:07,192 --> 01:50:11,501
SAM: Didn't he give us something to give to them?
Did we do that? Yes, we gave them

1238
01:50:11,501 --> 01:50:13,683
what you told us to.

1239
01:50:13,683 --> 01:50:14,977
LAURA: The locket.

1240
01:50:14,977 --> 01:50:17,114
MATT: "Thank you. I appreciate that."

1241
01:50:17,114 --> 01:50:22,518
MARISHA: We told them you're doing great and we
told them you were doing fantastic and wonderful

1242
01:50:22,518 --> 01:50:23,713
and successful.

1243
01:50:23,713 --> 01:50:27,522
MATT: "Well, thank you. When all this is done, I
should go visit. It's been a while."

1244
01:50:27,522 --> 01:50:29,806
LIAM: They seem very proud of you.

1245
01:50:29,806 --> 01:50:33,076
MATT: "Taken a while."

1246
01:50:33,076 --> 01:50:38,783
SAM: They told us you weren't potty-trained until
you were six. Is that true?

1247
01:50:38,783 --> 01:50:47,523
MATT: "Give me your dagger." He takes it, runs his
fingers on the blade. The slight curvature to it

1248
01:50:47,523 --> 01:50:56,416
out there to the point. He does his Identify.
Forged with a mercurial metal pulled from the Far

1249
01:50:56,416 --> 01:51:01,989
Realm. Light dances and shifts across this curved
blade. It has a plus three bonus to attack and

1250
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:07,833
damage rolls made with the dagger. It also deals
an additional 1d8 psychic damage on a hit.

1251
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:13,508
Whenever Whisper is thrown, you can choose to
transform into shadow and merge with the blade,

1252
01:51:13,508 --> 01:51:19,384
teleporting instantly to wherever the blade
impacts. Which means you can teleport as far as

1253
01:51:19,384 --> 01:51:24,887
you can throw the dagger, which is the max range
of the dagger. Yeah, so 60 feet, you go wherever

1254
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:29,074
it throws to. If the target is a creature, you
emerge adjacent to the target in a space of your

1255
01:51:29,074 --> 01:51:33,262
choice around the creature. Whenever you
critically hit a creature with an attack with

1256
01:51:33,262 --> 01:51:37,275
Whisper, the target has to make a wisdom saving
throw against a DC 18 or become frightened of you

1257
01:51:37,275 --> 01:51:39,150
for one minute.

1258
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:40,966
LIAM: Well, it's either Pike or me.

1259
01:51:40,966 --> 01:51:42,366
(laughter)

1260
01:51:42,366 --> 01:51:44,279
LAURA: What about Keyleth?

1261
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:46,086
MATT: It's up to you guys.

1262
01:51:46,086 --> 01:51:50,061
LIAM: You're going to fight with a little-- you
want it?

1263
01:51:50,061 --> 01:51:54,757
MARISHA: I've been practicing my juggling, to be
fair. I could use it in my knife juggling. Yeah.

1264
01:51:54,757 --> 01:51:57,273
No. What am I going to do with it?

1265
01:51:57,273 --> 01:52:03,688
TRAVIS: I honestly would like to make a case for
it. Just consider one thing: I chase people around

1266
01:52:03,688 --> 01:52:09,407
the battlefield. And I really have a hard time
getting to them sometimes. It'd be really great to

1267
01:52:09,407 --> 01:52:14,208
travel 50 feet, then throw another 60, and then be
right on their fucking asses.

1268
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:17,644
MARISHA: Do they happen in the same turn? They
happen in the same turn, yeah?

1269
01:52:17,644 --> 01:52:21,245
MATT: Yeah. The minute you throw and hit
something, it immediately teleports you if you

1270
01:52:21,245 --> 01:52:25,045
choose. It doesn't have to happen. You could throw
it, and then it hits the ground and you stay where

1271
01:52:25,045 --> 01:52:28,731
you are if you want to, but if you choose, you can
travel with the blade and essentially appear

1272
01:52:28,731 --> 01:52:31,603
Nightcrawler-style in shadow next to whatever you
hit.

1273
01:52:31,603 --> 01:52:39,535
LIAM: This knife is so sexy, though, and you are
so invulnerable to everything.

1274
01:52:39,535 --> 01:52:47,752
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, for consideration.
Obviously, daggers are your bag, baby.

1275
01:52:47,752 --> 01:52:50,915
LIAM: What if--

1276
01:52:50,915 --> 01:52:52,667
SAM: You arm wrestle for it.

1277
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:58,416
LIAM: No. What, give him this? I'm considering
giving you my cloak instead.

1278
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:00,754
SAM: Haste? No.

1279
01:53:00,754 --> 01:53:02,310
LAURA: Your armor?

1280
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:03,902
LIAM: No! My cloak.

1281
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:05,175
SAM: Which one's that?

1282
01:53:05,175 --> 01:53:06,691
LIAM: Displacer cloak.

1283
01:53:06,691 --> 01:53:07,876
SAM: What does that do?

1284
01:53:07,876 --> 01:53:09,275
TALIESIN: Makes you very hard to hit.

1285
01:53:09,275 --> 01:53:11,568
LAURA: Yeah, but Grog doesn't need that.

1286
01:53:11,568 --> 01:53:14,732
LIAM: He doesn't need anything. He's got a
thousand hit points.

1287
01:53:14,732 --> 01:53:16,864
TRAVIS: Do I need to be attuned to Whisper?

1288
01:53:16,864 --> 01:53:18,232
LIAM: Yeah, all of these.

1289
01:53:18,232 --> 01:53:20,071
MATT: You have to be attuned to Whisper, yeah.

1290
01:53:20,071 --> 01:53:22,210
TRAVIS: Somebody else can have it.

1291
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:25,783
MATT: "If there was anything else 
you need me to look at, I still have

1292
01:53:25,783 --> 01:53:28,473
"a full score of simple tricks."

1293
01:53:28,473 --> 01:53:30,357
TRAVIS: Simple tricks?

1294
01:53:30,357 --> 01:53:35,145
MATT: "Is there anything else you want me to look
at before I go to bed, because it's late."

1295
01:53:35,145 --> 01:53:37,961
LIAM: What time is it, Shaun?

1296
01:53:37,961 --> 01:53:43,717
MATT: At this point now, the sun has gone down.
It's, I'd say, nine in the evening.

1297
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:47,155
LIAM: Nine. Percival, you should go to bed.

1298
01:53:47,155 --> 01:53:50,479
LAURA: Wait, I have an old music box. Can you look
at it and see if it's magical?

1299
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:53,310
TRAVIS: An old wooden music box?

1300
01:53:53,310 --> 01:54:04,908
MATT: He takes the music box. Eyes flare up. "No,
it's an impressive music box."

1301
01:54:04,908 --> 01:54:07,340
LAURA: Just a music box? Lovely.

1302
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:15,104
SAM: Hey, you read Marquesan. The language of
Marquet.

1303
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:16,832
MATT: Marquesian, but yeah.

1304
01:54:16,832 --> 01:54:22,716
SAM: Marquesian. I got this book, found this book
in this shitty casino office. It's written in

1305
01:54:22,716 --> 01:54:24,776
Marquesian.

1306
01:54:24,776 --> 01:54:36,697
MATT: "Don't pronounce it, please. It's offensive.
Huh. Well." He blushes a little and closes it.

1307
01:54:36,697 --> 01:54:39,618
"I think it found the right owner."

1308
01:54:39,618 --> 01:54:42,012
SAM: Oh. It's a porno.

1309
01:54:42,012 --> 01:54:47,025
MATT: "It's an instructional guide. You might
learn something."

1310
01:54:47,025 --> 01:54:48,873
LAURA: It's an instructional guide?

1311
01:54:48,873 --> 01:54:51,495
SAM: I can't read it, though. How will I learn?

1312
01:54:51,495 --> 01:54:54,949
MATT: "Maybe you start taking classes in
Marquesian."

1313
01:54:54,949 --> 01:54:57,232
LAURA: Are there any illustrations?

1314
01:54:57,232 --> 01:54:59,287
LIAM: Yeah, pictures. You like pictures, Scanlan.

1315
01:54:59,287 --> 01:55:00,956
SAM: Are there?

1316
01:55:00,956 --> 01:55:04,205
MATT: (chuckles) You scan through real fast, and
yeah. You only got a little ways into the book

1317
01:55:04,205 --> 01:55:07,541
when you first looked at it. In the center,
there's probably a good 30 pages of really

1318
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:12,529
beautiful old-- it's essentially the Kama Sutra.

1319
01:55:12,529 --> 01:55:14,882
(laughter)

1320
01:55:14,882 --> 01:55:16,953
TALIESIN: I think that one folds out. That's quite
nice.

1321
01:55:16,953 --> 01:55:18,718
SAM: Oh, ooh?

1322
01:55:18,718 --> 01:55:20,229
LIAM: Oh, it's a pop-up book.

1323
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:22,356
(laughter)

1324
01:55:22,356 --> 01:55:26,870
TRAVIS: Scanlan, isn't there anything else you
need to deliver to one of these two fine

1325
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,008
gentlemen?

1326
01:55:28,008 --> 01:55:29,827
SAM: I don't think so.

1327
01:55:29,827 --> 01:55:35,232
TRAVIS: No, I believe there is something you
acquired for one of these two gents.

1328
01:55:35,232 --> 01:55:39,945
SAM: Ix-nay on the ice-spay. There are authorities
around.

1329
01:55:39,945 --> 01:55:42,155
TRAVIS: Why are you calling spice "ice-spay?"

1330
01:55:42,155 --> 01:55:46,341
SAM: Grog, if someone hears you talking about this
shit, you could be in deep trouble.

1331
01:55:46,341 --> 01:55:51,243
TALIESIN: I literally am the law here. 
I am literally the living embodiment

1332
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:53,261
of law and justice.

1333
01:55:53,261 --> 01:55:54,506
SAM: Jarett.

1334
01:55:54,506 --> 01:56:00,426
MATT: "Yes? I'm glad to hear everyone is doing
okay, and it's good to see you here in one piece.

1335
01:56:00,426 --> 01:56:02,737
"How was your journey?"

1336
01:56:02,737 --> 01:56:04,851
SAM: It was great! (quietly) Do you spice?

1337
01:56:04,851 --> 01:56:07,788
MATT: "Right!"

1338
01:56:07,788 --> 01:56:11,489
SAM: We had a great time! (quietly) Do you spice,
boss? Do you want to spice something?

1339
01:56:11,489 --> 01:56:13,597
MATT: "If you brought some, yes."

1340
01:56:13,597 --> 01:56:16,887
SAM: I like the way you look.

1341
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:20,564
(laughter)

1342
01:56:20,564 --> 01:56:22,722
SAM: All right. I give him one bag of spice.

1343
01:56:22,722 --> 01:56:31,277
MATT: "That is a lot of fusaka. Thank you very
much. That lasts a long time."

1344
01:56:31,277 --> 01:56:32,757
LAURA: He spent 50 gold on it.

1345
01:56:32,757 --> 01:56:34,554
MATT: "You paid 50 gold for this?!"

1346
01:56:34,554 --> 01:56:35,781
SAM: For the pair.

1347
01:56:35,781 --> 01:56:37,895
MATT: "Oh, you got swindled, my friend!"

1348
01:56:37,895 --> 01:56:39,852
(laughter)

1349
01:56:39,852 --> 01:56:43,733
MATT: "But I appreciate it. It's very
thoughtful."

1350
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:46,627
SAM: It was worth it to see the smile on your
face.

1351
01:56:46,627 --> 01:56:48,239
MATT: "Well, thank you."

1352
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:52,245
SAM: I'll keep this bag, if that's all right with
you. I've grown quite accustomed to the stuff.

1353
01:56:52,245 --> 01:56:53,577
It's really quite lovely.

1354
01:56:53,577 --> 01:56:58,933
MATT: "Great! I'll give you some tips on how 
to prepare it, but you know what? I'll cook

1355
01:56:58,933 --> 01:57:03,835
"a classic Marquesian feast in the coming 
days for all of us in thank you for the spice."

1356
01:57:03,835 --> 01:57:05,163
LAURA: Thank you.

1357
01:57:05,163 --> 01:57:06,388
LIAM: Oh, Jarett.

1358
01:57:06,388 --> 01:57:07,369
MATT: "Yes?"

1359
01:57:07,369 --> 01:57:10,026
LIAM: This is Kynan.

1360
01:57:10,026 --> 01:57:18,020
MATT: Who's been ghosting you guys the whole time,
looking extremely nervous.

1361
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:23,382
LIAM: Kynan has been telling me that he wanted to
help protect Whitestone. He hasn't anywhere to

1362
01:57:23,382 --> 01:57:32,396
live. He needs something to do with his time, and
he has a fire in his belly and wants to serve.

1363
01:57:32,396 --> 01:57:39,809
MATT: "All right. A friend of you is a friend of
ours. You are able-bodied?"

1364
01:57:39,809 --> 01:57:45,941
Kynan is taken aback by the whole thing. His eyes
are wide, still staring at you. Slowly, he starts

1365
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:55,968
talking out the side of his mouth to Jarett. "Yes.
Anything. Whatever I can do."

1366
01:57:55,968 --> 01:58:02,154
Jarett walks up and puts his hand on his shoulder
and goes, "Well, first off, you need to be more

1367
01:58:02,154 --> 01:58:07,701
"assertive. You are talking like a sniveling
coward. You need to project your chest, shoulders

1368
01:58:07,701 --> 01:58:13,945
"back, and when you speak, you speak with intent
and-- ah, it's late. We'll work on it tomorrow."

1369
01:58:13,945 --> 01:58:16,331
TALIESIN: I may have a thought for the boy later.

1370
01:58:16,331 --> 01:58:22,066
MATT: "Oh! Before I forget, this came for you,
Keyleth."

1371
01:58:22,066 --> 01:58:24,866
MARISHA: What now?

1372
01:58:24,866 --> 01:58:26,274
LAURA: A letter?

1373
01:58:26,274 --> 01:58:28,999
SAM: (singing) Letters! We got letters!

1374
01:58:28,999 --> 01:58:37,299
MATT: "Traders came in. A parcel in your name.
Don't know who it's from."

1375
01:58:37,299 --> 01:58:38,883
MARISHA: What did they look like?

1376
01:58:38,883 --> 01:58:40,848
SAM: How did they get through the invisible wall?

1377
01:58:40,848 --> 01:58:42,594
MARISHA: How do they know my name?

1378
01:58:42,594 --> 01:58:49,310
MATT: "I don't know. They were sent from Westruun,
I think it was."

1379
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:51,272
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Open that.

1380
01:58:51,272 --> 01:58:52,562
LAURA: What is it?

1381
01:58:52,562 --> 01:58:57,084
MARISHA: It's got something thick in it, which
isn't--

1382
01:58:57,084 --> 01:58:59,119
SAM: Could be a seal.

1383
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:06,200
MATT: Read the letter first.

1384
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:07,749
MARISHA: Read the letter first?

1385
01:59:07,749 --> 01:59:12,207
SAM: It's in Marquesian.

1386
01:59:12,207 --> 01:59:15,968
MARISHA: It's long.

1387
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:19,897
PATRICK ROTHFUSS: (offscreen) Keyleth, I write to
let you and your companions know that the repair

1388
01:59:19,897 --> 01:59:25,277
of Westruun is proceeding well. I will not bore
you with the details. Suffice to say that our

1389
01:59:25,277 --> 01:59:32,111
children are well-fed and safe, our elderly and
infirm are cared for and comfortable. Without the

1390
01:59:32,111 --> 01:59:34,651
help of you and yours, this would not be the
case.

1391
01:59:34,651 --> 01:59:41,777
The folk in charge argue constantly, but that is
to be expected, and it is no bad thing. They all

1392
01:59:41,777 --> 01:59:47,077
want the same good things in different ways. I
listen, mostly, and do what I can to make sure

1393
01:59:47,077 --> 01:59:51,273
that they listen to each other. Without listening,
nothing good can happen.

1394
01:59:51,273 --> 02:00:02,322
The town-- when I say the repair is going well, it
is a hard thing for me to talk about. I am not a

1395
02:00:02,322 --> 02:00:08,810
particularly clever man, and much of this is new
to me. When you make a mistake with metal, you can

1396
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:14,872
melt things down and start afresh. It is
irritating, and it costs in time and soot and

1397
02:00:14,872 --> 02:00:20,355
sweat, but it can be done. There is a comfort in
iron, knowing that a fresh start is always

1398
02:00:20,355 --> 02:00:26,926
possible. But a city is not a sword. It is a
living thing, and living things defy simple

1399
02:00:26,926 --> 02:00:34,446
fixing. Roots cannot be reforged. They scar, and
broken branches must be cut and sealed with tar,

1400
02:00:34,446 --> 02:00:40,206
and this makes me angry, as it always has, and my
anger has no place to go.

1401
02:00:40,206 --> 02:00:48,483
It was easier when I was young. I could use my
anger like a hammer against the world. I was so

1402
02:00:48,483 --> 02:00:55,213
sure of myself and my friends and my rightness. I
would hammer at the world, and breaking felt like

1403
02:00:55,213 --> 02:01:02,667
making to me, and I was good at it. And while I
was not wrong, neither was I entirely right.

1404
02:01:02,667 --> 02:01:10,745
Nothing is simple. I do not work in wood. I am not
brave enough for that. There is a comfort in iron,

1405
02:01:10,745 --> 02:01:18,750
a promise of safety, a second chance if mistakes
are made. But a city is more a forest than a

1406
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:24,802
sword. No, it needs more tending than that.
Perhaps a city is like a garden, then.

1407
02:01:24,802 --> 02:01:32,932
So these days, it seems I have become a gardener.
I dig foundations in the earth. I sow rows of

1408
02:01:32,932 --> 02:01:41,279
houses. I plan and plant. I watch the skies for
rain and ruin. I cannot help but think that you

1409
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:48,071
would be better at this, but circumstance has put
both of us in our own odd place. You are forced to

1410
02:01:48,071 --> 02:01:54,400
be a hammer in the world, and my ungentle hands
are learning how to tend a plot of land.

1411
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,784
We must do what we can do.

1412
02:01:56,784 --> 02:02:03,837
Did you know that there are some seeds that cannot
sprout unless they are first burned? A friend once

1413
02:02:03,885 --> 02:02:12,855
told me that. She was-- she was a bookish sort. I
think of gardening constantly these days. I wear

1414
02:02:12,855 --> 02:02:18,666
your gift, and I think of you, and I think it is
interesting that there are some living things that

1415
02:02:18,666 --> 02:02:22,155
need to pass through fire before they flourish.

1416
02:02:22,155 --> 02:02:30,235
I ramble. You have the heart of a gardener, and
because of this, you think of consequence, and

1417
02:02:30,235 --> 02:02:37,615
your current path pains you. I am not wise, and I
do not give advice, but I have come to know a few

1418
02:02:37,615 --> 02:02:45,618
things: sometimes breaking is making, even iron
can start again, and there are many things that

1419
02:02:45,662 --> 02:02:50,006
move through fire and find themselves much better
for it afterward.

1420
02:02:50,006 --> 02:02:57,664
I have enclosed a gift. Once it was a sword, but
it has changed. It is a small thing, and silly.

1421
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:05,051
Please forgive an old man for his foolishness.
Still, I hope it brings you some small comfort.

1422
02:03:05,051 --> 02:03:07,785
Kindly, Kerr.

1423
02:03:07,785 --> 02:03:13,209
MARISHA: (hoarsely) Holy shit.

1424
02:03:13,209 --> 02:03:18,278
SAM: What's the thing?

1425
02:03:18,278 --> 02:03:19,947
MARISHA: I don't know what to say.

1426
02:03:19,947 --> 02:03:23,613
LIAM: Are you all right?

1427
02:03:23,613 --> 02:03:26,197
MARISHA: It was Kerr.

1428
02:03:26,197 --> 02:03:29,221
LAURA: Is he proposing to you?

1429
02:03:29,221 --> 02:03:31,093
(laughter)

1430
02:03:31,093 --> 02:03:35,529
MARISHA: It's got branches on it.

1431
02:03:35,529 --> 02:03:38,529
TALIESIN: It's quite beautiful.

1432
02:03:38,529 --> 02:03:48,273
SAM: Does it say something?

1433
02:03:48,273 --> 02:03:51,207
MARISHA: I have passed through fire.

1434
02:03:51,207 --> 02:03:54,375
LAURA: Wow. Motherfucker, that's cool.

1435
02:03:54,375 --> 02:04:16,689
MARISHA: This is a lot to deal with right now. We
have friends. I have a friend.

1436
02:04:16,689 --> 02:04:22,165
LAURA: You're becoming a wonderful leader,
Keyleth.

1437
02:04:22,165 --> 02:04:32,900
MARISHA: And as kind as his letter was, I think
something was wrong, and I think there's more to

1438
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:51,069
his message. Vex, maybe you? He scribbled out some
words.

1439
02:04:51,069 --> 02:04:53,017
LAURA: Let me see.

1440
02:04:53,017 --> 02:04:57,081
MARISHA: And speaks vaguely in areas around them.

1441
02:04:57,081 --> 02:05:11,989
LAURA: Can't tell.

1442
02:05:11,989 --> 02:05:19,500
LIAM: Those are called words, Grog.

1443
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:25,046
LAURA: I don't know. Maybe he just didn't like
what he wrote.

1444
02:05:25,046 --> 02:05:31,939
MATT: Make an insight check, Vex.

1445
02:05:31,939 --> 02:05:33,808
LAURA: Natural 20!

1446
02:05:33,808 --> 02:05:42,595
MATT: Looking at handwriting and the way it's
scribbled out, the scribble is hastily, and little

1447
02:05:42,595 --> 02:05:47,935
bits of text that come through, it appears that
they are just thoughts that he may have felt

1448
02:05:47,935 --> 02:05:52,824
uncomfortable putting in the letter after writing
them out, and then scratched them out. There

1449
02:05:52,824 --> 02:05:56,889
doesn't appear to be any serious agency or danger
around them.

1450
02:05:56,889 --> 02:05:58,904
LAURA: I think it's fine, Keyleth.

1451
02:05:58,904 --> 02:06:01,566
MARISHA: You sure? I worry.

1452
02:06:01,566 --> 02:06:04,074
LAURA: I think he perhaps bared his heart a little
too much.

1453
02:06:04,074 --> 02:06:06,150
MARISHA: What do you mean?

1454
02:06:06,150 --> 02:06:11,307
LAURA: Maybe he said things he thought better of.

1455
02:06:11,307 --> 02:06:26,402
MARISHA: I don't know what to say. It's really
comforting to know that not everyone hates us.

1456
02:06:26,402 --> 02:06:35,975
LAURA: Speaking of, I did have Captain Damon bring
his airship here. Is that stupid?

1457
02:06:35,975 --> 02:06:47,993
TALIESIN: No. No, that's not a bad idea. We need a
better way of communicating with them. And I'm

1458
02:06:47,993 --> 02:06:54,772
rethinking. Did you collect everything from the
battle?

1459
02:06:54,772 --> 02:06:57,131
SAM: Yes.

1460
02:06:57,131 --> 02:07:05,466
TALIESIN: Good. That is a discussion we should
have in private downstairs. Perhaps in the

1461
02:07:05,466 --> 02:07:15,812
morning? Bring everything downstairs and have a
discussion with Cassandra and anybody we trust.

1462
02:07:15,812 --> 02:07:24,017
LAURA: Yes. We should sleep. You should. You look
very tired.

1463
02:07:24,017 --> 02:07:29,557
TRAVIS: What time of the day is it right now?

1464
02:07:29,557 --> 02:07:36,614
MATT: It's getting later in the evening, close to
10pm, comparably, even though you guys woke up

1465
02:07:36,614 --> 02:07:40,896
maybe three hours ago.

1466
02:07:40,896 --> 02:07:48,009
LAURA: Jetlag, man. It'll get you. I don't know
what to do.

1467
02:07:48,009 --> 02:07:53,378
TALIESIN: We can have this conversation tonight.
I'm going to feel miserable for a while.

1468
02:07:53,378 --> 02:07:55,724
MARISHA: I don't think it's a wise idea.

1469
02:07:55,724 --> 02:07:57,967
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could certainly let you sleep.

1470
02:07:57,967 --> 02:08:03,153
SAM: We do have to start planning for the next leg
of our journey.

1471
02:08:03,153 --> 02:08:06,943
LIAM: It's true, but Percy needs to go the fuck to
sleep, seriously.

1472
02:08:06,943 --> 02:08:10,060
TALIESIN: I will admit I fear sleep at the
moment.

1473
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:12,929
LAURA: How about some coffee, then?

1474
02:08:12,929 --> 02:08:16,249
LIAM: Jack him up first?

1475
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:23,437
TALIESIN: How am I physically, at the moment?

1476
02:08:23,437 --> 02:08:29,174
MATT: Physically, you're sore and you're drained.
The essence of the ritual and the following

1477
02:08:29,174 --> 02:08:35,128
healing spells-- you're physically whole, but
there is a very physical toll on you from the

1478
02:08:35,128 --> 02:08:36,408
ritual as well.

1479
02:08:36,408 --> 02:08:38,313
TALIESIN: So I'm not filled with holes or
anything.

1480
02:08:38,313 --> 02:08:44,129
MATT: No, but you feel like a walking bruise, and
every movement of your body is fraught with such

1481
02:08:44,129 --> 02:08:52,311
physical exhaustion that you haven't felt, and
only time is going to take care of that. You're

1482
02:08:52,311 --> 02:08:56,799
effectively at minus four to any d20 rolls you
make until you rest. Then it becomes a minus

1483
02:08:56,799 --> 02:09:01,470
three, then another night's rest becomes a minus
two. So you're in a rough spot for the next few

1484
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:04,255
days, unless you're resting consistently.

1485
02:09:04,255 --> 02:09:13,278
TALIESIN: (sighs) We do have to have a
conversation about all that. We either have it now

1486
02:09:13,278 --> 02:09:14,459
or later.

1487
02:09:14,459 --> 02:09:20,751
TRAVIS: Take a fucking nap, man! We'll convene in
the morning!

1488
02:09:20,751 --> 02:09:22,884
LIAM: You're outvoted, Percy. Go to bed.

1489
02:09:22,884 --> 02:09:24,699
MARISHA: You literally just rose from the dead.

1490
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:26,733
TALIESIN: I'm going to need new clothes.

1491
02:09:26,733 --> 02:09:31,413
LIAM: Nobody wants to talk to you right now. We
want you to go to sleep. We're going to go have a

1492
02:09:31,413 --> 02:09:34,814
drink and have a fabulous time. We'll see you in
the morning.

1493
02:09:34,814 --> 02:09:43,882
TALIESIN: Right. I'll see you in the morning. I'm
going to go up to my room and pass out.

1494
02:09:43,882 --> 02:09:49,261
MATT: For the brief moment you have consciousness
as you enter the room, it is a wondrous, welcoming

1495
02:09:49,261 --> 02:09:53,968
sight. You have just enough time to get that
thought across before you facedown in your bed and

1496
02:09:53,968 --> 02:10:01,691
right to sleep. Clothes still on, facedown from
the corner of the bed. It's a terrible sight, but

1497
02:10:01,691 --> 02:10:05,993
you don't care. The rest of you, what do you wish
to do?

1498
02:10:05,993 --> 02:10:08,785
LAURA: I give Pike a huge hug.

1499
02:10:08,785 --> 02:10:11,640
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1500
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:15,176
ASHLEY: I give everybody a big hug!

1501
02:10:15,176 --> 02:10:17,811
TRAVIS: Yeah, little Pike!

1502
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:21,479
ASHLEY: With my gauntlets on, so a big bear hug!

1503
02:10:21,479 --> 02:10:24,091
MATT: It hurts a little, and you're proud of her
for it.

1504
02:10:24,091 --> 02:10:26,273
ASHLEY: (growls)

1505
02:10:26,273 --> 02:10:29,784
TRAVIS: Yeah, I give her a fist bump with the
gauntlets, and the knuckles.

1506
02:10:29,784 --> 02:10:34,785
MATT: It actually causes this strange collision
shockwave. It pushes you back a second because

1507
02:10:34,785 --> 02:10:36,647
there's too much strength in one fistbump!

1508
02:10:36,647 --> 02:10:39,481
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike, you're getting too strong for
your own good!

1509
02:10:39,481 --> 02:10:41,755
ASHLEY: (laughs) Hey!

1510
02:10:41,755 --> 02:10:43,694
(laughter)

1511
02:10:43,694 --> 02:10:49,360
ASHLEY: Oh man. Should we all have a drink or
something?

1512
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,511
LIAM: Jarett, Shaun, can you get away?

1513
02:10:51,511 --> 02:11:01,181
MATT: Shaun goes, "For a moment, maybe. I should
probably rest, as well. Jarett?"

1514
02:11:01,181 --> 02:11:06,760
Jarett goes, "You know what? Yes. Drink sounds
nice. It's been a while. Good company."

1515
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,143
LIAM: Kynan, come on.

1516
02:11:10,143 --> 02:11:19,720
MATT: Kynan's still in shock and nods and slinks--
as he walks behind you, he walks with his head low

1517
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:23,731
and you can see he averts his gaze towards the
ground, watching where he's going to be walking.

1518
02:11:23,731 --> 02:11:32,877
Gilmore individually gives you all a brief hug or
handshake. "I'm sure we'll talk more tomorrow.

1519
02:11:32,877 --> 02:11:38,210
"I'm going to go join Percy's plan of action."

1520
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:45,873
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to Vax? So I'm assuming
you're taking this little chick under your wing.

1521
02:11:45,873 --> 02:11:50,445
LIAM: Well, I'm not taking him with us to Draconia
or anywhere, no.

1522
02:11:50,445 --> 02:11:53,392
TRAVIS: No, but you're sure he's clean?

1523
02:11:53,392 --> 02:12:00,479
LIAM: I might like to have Pike take a look at him
in the morning, but I think so.

1524
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:02,487
TRAVIS: He's pretty spaced out.

1525
02:12:02,487 --> 02:12:05,961
LAURA: Why doesn't Pike look at him now? Are you
tapped, Pike?

1526
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:09,438
ASHLEY: No. Who is this guy?

1527
02:12:09,438 --> 02:12:15,956
MATT: You recognize him, Pike, as you say that,
looking at him, though much more harrowed, a

1528
02:12:15,956 --> 02:12:24,573
little more built than you last saw him, but this
is the young man who was waiting for you guys

1529
02:12:24,573 --> 02:12:31,279
outside of Greyskull Keep a few months back,
asking to join, who was bright-eyed

1530
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:33,474
and inexperienced.

1531
02:12:33,474 --> 02:12:35,082
LIAM: And I clocked him.

1532
02:12:35,082 --> 02:12:41,599
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. Hi, again.

1533
02:12:41,599 --> 02:12:46,915
MATT: "Hi." It's one of the things where he's
always looking down, but you step into his field

1534
02:12:46,915 --> 02:12:51,016
of vision, already being shorter than him. As
you're looking up at him with your gauntlets there

1535
02:12:51,016 --> 02:12:55,841
at your side, he's looking at you, but he's also
not wanting to look you in the eyes a little bit.

1536
02:12:55,841 --> 02:12:59,383
"Hello, Pike. It's good to see you."

1537
02:12:59,383 --> 02:13:03,106
ASHLEY: Good to see you.

1538
02:13:03,106 --> 02:13:09,197
TRAVIS: Pike, do us a favor and give him a
once-over. Make sure there's no funk on him.

1539
02:13:09,197 --> 02:13:12,312
LAURA: He was traveling with Ripley, Pike.

1540
02:13:12,312 --> 02:13:14,647
ASHLEY: He was probably what?

1541
02:13:14,647 --> 02:13:18,082
LAURA: He was traveling with Ripley. Oh no.

1542
02:13:18,082 --> 02:13:22,099
SAM: She froze, she froze in a weird position.

1543
02:13:22,099 --> 02:13:27,571
(laughter)

1544
02:13:27,571 --> 02:13:33,214
MATT: Welcome back. We had a bit of a technical
difficulty there, but apparently, we're back up

1545
02:13:33,214 --> 02:13:35,139
and streaming and everything's good, so we're
going to jump right back into the story

1546
02:13:35,139 --> 02:13:36,785
where we were.

1547
02:13:36,785 --> 02:13:41,888
SAM: I am currently holding Gilmore's severed head
in my hands, right? Blood spilled, dripping--

1548
02:13:41,888 --> 02:13:46,273
MATT: Just gouts of it, anime-style like Fist of
the North Star, spraying.

1549
02:13:46,273 --> 02:13:47,853
LAURA: And Percy's dead again.

1550
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:49,611
SAM: Percy died, yeah. Percy died.

1551
02:13:49,611 --> 02:13:52,974
MARISHA: Yeah, he's gone. I've cried eight more
times.

1552
02:13:52,974 --> 02:13:54,632
LAURA: My bad, sorry.

1553
02:13:54,632 --> 02:13:58,019
SAM: We need to resurrect him. Ready? One, two,
three.

1554
02:13:58,019 --> 02:14:00,356
(yelling)

1555
02:14:00,356 --> 02:14:02,219
MARISHA: Thanks, Vesh!

1556
02:14:02,219 --> 02:14:04,509
TRAVIS: We're having Pike check--

1557
02:14:04,509 --> 02:14:08,685
MATT: So having Pike check Kynan. Kynan's looking
at you, Pike. What are you going to do?

1558
02:14:08,685 --> 02:14:13,843
ASHLEY: I'm going to Detect Evil.

1559
02:14:13,843 --> 02:14:25,436
MATT: Okay. Looking over and you finish the spell,
there is no sense of evil from him. Make an

1560
02:14:25,436 --> 02:14:30,723
insight check. I'll say with advantage because of
the nature of the spell, because why not?

1561
02:14:30,723 --> 02:14:33,706
(laughter)

1562
02:14:33,706 --> 02:14:36,001
LAURA: Because you are all powerful and you can do
that.

1563
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:39,316
MATT: Because he is a broken man standing before
you.

1564
02:14:39,316 --> 02:14:45,460
ASHLEY: Okay. 28!

1565
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:50,156
MATT: You don't sense any evil in the sense of
what the spell would gather. You do sense from

1566
02:14:50,156 --> 02:14:55,551
looking at his expression, his reaction, and what
bit of information you have, this is a person

1567
02:14:55,551 --> 02:15:03,374
that's been heavily brainwashed, and their idea of
what the world was, or as it was, has been broken,

1568
02:15:03,374 --> 02:15:12,413
probably many times. Kynan's in a rough spot, and
the guilt is weighing so heavily on him right now

1569
02:15:12,413 --> 02:15:17,183
that it's probably best that somebody keep an eye
on him.

1570
02:15:17,183 --> 02:15:31,964
ASHLEY: I put my hand on his shoulder and I say:
Kynan, you look like a man who feels like he's

1571
02:15:31,964 --> 02:15:39,923
made a mistake, and you just need to turn that
frown upside down.

1572
02:15:39,923 --> 02:15:42,240
(laughter)

1573
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:43,751
SAM: Wise.

1574
02:15:43,751 --> 02:15:53,249
MATT: Looking down at your smiling blue gnomish
eyes, this broken boy of a man does mutter a

1575
02:15:53,249 --> 02:16:09,803
slight chuckle in reaction, then catches himself
and nods. "I have a lot to think about.

1576
02:16:09,803 --> 02:16:16,713
"I have a lot of penance to deal with. Thank you."

1577
02:16:16,713 --> 02:16:18,653
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

1578
02:16:18,653 --> 02:16:22,385
MATT: "Maybe a drink would help."

1579
02:16:22,385 --> 02:16:24,575
ASHLEY: Of course. That always helps.

1580
02:16:24,575 --> 02:16:32,340
MATT: Jarett smacks him on the shoulder. "All
right, then. Let's get this pup trashed. Follow me."

1581
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:39,187
He leads you down to one of the two taverns.
The one that had been destroyed as part of the

1582
02:16:39,187 --> 02:16:45,439
initial battle here in Whitestone has been
constructed. The roof's still mostly missing, but

1583
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:50,726
they have a covering over it. It doesn't appear to
be a rainy evening, so it should be fine. There's

1584
02:16:50,726 --> 02:16:56,352
a handful of folk in there having drinks. Jarett
treats you all to a round of finer ale of

1585
02:16:56,352 --> 02:16:59,870
Whitestone brand. They don't have a large
selection of rare imported drinks here, but it's

1586
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:04,881
enough to at least get the job done. Anything you
guys want to do specifically while you're all

1587
02:17:04,881 --> 02:17:06,027
having drinks tonight?

1588
02:17:06,027 --> 02:17:12,882
TRAVIS: Wait, Jarett! While we were in your hood,
I acquired this delicious little bit. And I pull

1589
02:17:12,882 --> 02:17:25,069
out the sandkheg bottle. This is called Seraph's
Swine Swallow. And I pour a little into a glass

1590
02:17:25,069 --> 02:17:26,611
and I hand it to him.

1591
02:17:26,611 --> 02:17:32,448
MATT: He goes, "I am not familiar with this. 
You say this is from Ank'Harel?"

1592
02:17:32,448 --> 02:17:39,435
TRAVIS: Yeah, and it's all in one. Hit the back of
the throat and swallow it all in one.

1593
02:17:39,435 --> 02:17:42,508
MATT: "To friends?"

1594
02:17:42,508 --> 02:17:44,690
TRAVIS: Yes. To friends, and to health.

1595
02:17:44,690 --> 02:17:46,176
MATT: "And to survival."

1596
02:17:46,176 --> 02:17:51,414
TRAVIS: And to fukasa. Sukasa. Mi casa.

1597
02:17:51,414 --> 02:17:53,709
(laughter)

1598
02:17:53,709 --> 02:17:55,615
MATT: Make a deception check.

1599
02:17:55,615 --> 02:18:01,457
TRAVIS: 14.

1600
02:18:01,457 --> 02:18:11,610
MATT: He gives you a keen look, looks to Vex,
nods. "To friends and trust."

1601
02:18:11,610 --> 02:18:14,950
LIAM: It's so worth it.

1602
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:19,982
TRAVIS: I take his cup. I pour a little, and I'm
like, can't let him take this ride by himself.

1603
02:18:19,982 --> 02:18:21,606
I pound it, as well.

1604
02:18:21,606 --> 02:18:23,388
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

1605
02:18:23,388 --> 02:18:26,306
LAURA: Oh no!

1606
02:18:26,306 --> 02:18:28,295
TRAVIS: Not great. 13.

1607
02:18:28,295 --> 02:18:40,654
MATT: The fiery rumble in your stomach is matched
directly behind by the heavy flow of numbness that

1608
02:18:40,654 --> 02:18:43,799
fills the entirety of your chest, jaw, and tongue.

1609
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:48,545
Jarett goes, 
(heavily slurred) "That was quite strong."

1610
02:18:48,545 --> 02:18:50,299
TRAVIS: (slurred) I think so, too.

1611
02:18:50,299 --> 02:18:53,708
MATT: (slurred) "You fucker."

1612
02:18:53,708 --> 02:18:56,656
(laughter)

1613
02:18:56,656 --> 02:19:00,780
MATT: Slams the glass down. (slurred) "Well, I'm
not going to have any conversation for a while."

1614
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:03,002
(laughter)

1615
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:08,817
TRAVIS: (slurred) You're talking really funny.
Let's braid each other's hair.

1616
02:19:08,817 --> 02:19:14,748
MATT: "Please don't. I think that I have far more
than you do, and it's too short, anyway.

1617
02:19:14,748 --> 02:19:18,920
"Be a waste of your time." 
He became Castilian, suddenly.

1618
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:28,937
LIAM: I get three drinks at the bar and I walk
past Keyleth and leave one on the table by her and

1619
02:19:28,937 --> 02:19:38,694
go and sit down by Kynan. I want to show you
something. I bought these months ago. And I root

1620
02:19:38,694 --> 02:19:43,509
around in my pack and I pull out the three finely
made daggers that I bought.

1621
02:19:43,509 --> 02:19:45,075
LAURA: They were expensive!

1622
02:19:45,075 --> 02:19:48,869
LIAM: She's right. They were expensive. I'm
actually not going to give them to you tonight

1623
02:19:48,869 --> 02:19:54,436
because you're worrying me a little bit, but in a
day or two, these are yours. I bought these for

1624
02:19:54,436 --> 02:20:10,178
you months ago. I looked for you. I visited the
butcher shop, and I missed you. I'm very sorry

1625
02:20:10,178 --> 02:20:18,692
about that. I wish that this had not... I wish
this had not played out the way it had.

1626
02:20:18,692 --> 02:20:22,108
MATT: "Me, too."

1627
02:20:22,108 --> 02:20:30,706
LIAM: You can atone. It is not too late. I see the
look in your eye. It is not too late.

1628
02:20:30,706 --> 02:20:36,017
MATT: He keeps looking over at Keyleth, and you
see every time he sees her, he has that spike of

1629
02:20:36,017 --> 02:20:37,388
guilt in his heart.

1630
02:20:37,388 --> 02:20:42,672
MARISHA: Yeah. You better, motherfucker.

1631
02:20:42,672 --> 02:20:52,481
LIAM: You fucked up, clearly. Big time. And you
can either curl in on yourself and rot in a ball,

1632
02:20:52,481 --> 02:21:03,477
or you can make up for it. You know what's going
on in Tal'Dorei. You know what's going on. I spent

1633
02:21:03,477 --> 02:21:11,315
too much time looking inward. It's pointless. 
Be of use.

1634
02:21:11,315 --> 02:21:15,845
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1635
02:21:15,845 --> 02:21:26,089
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. That is a 17.

1636
02:21:26,089 --> 02:21:33,383
MATT: Most of this conversation, his eyes have
been darting away from connecting with yours. The

1637
02:21:33,383 --> 02:21:37,848
evasion has been persistent, but as soon as those
words finish, his eyes finally lock with yours and

1638
02:21:37,848 --> 02:21:53,078
stay with you. He takes a beat and goes, "I know
what I've done. And there's no way I can express

1639
02:21:53,078 --> 02:22:10,282
"how sorry I am. The woman I followed, she was
confident, she was persuasive, and she picked up

1640
02:22:10,282 --> 02:22:16,821
"what others wouldn't, and I bought into that. 
And that shows once again that I was never ready

1641
02:22:16,821 --> 02:22:22,646
"to begin with, like you said, and I appreciate 
that wisdom in hindsight."

1642
02:22:22,646 --> 02:22:26,078
LIAM: I was kind of a dick.

1643
02:22:26,078 --> 02:22:35,382
MATT: "You were kind of a dick. But still. I'll do
my best. I can't make any promises,

1644
02:22:35,382 --> 02:22:38,813
"but I'll do my best."

1645
02:22:38,813 --> 02:22:40,902
LIAM: That's all any of us can do.

1646
02:22:40,902 --> 02:22:43,459
MATT: "Yeah."

1647
02:22:43,459 --> 02:22:50,351
LIAM: You're battered. You're not broken. 
Do better.

1648
02:22:50,351 --> 02:22:53,120
MATT: "Okay."

1649
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,981
LIAM: Drink up.

1650
02:22:55,981 --> 02:23:02,959
MATT: You guys share a silent drink.

1651
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:08,840
MARISHA: I shoot him daggers whenever his eyes
meet mine at one point.

1652
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,578
MATT: And he immediately goes back to his drink
and takes another sip.

1653
02:23:11,578 --> 02:23:15,106
ALL: Oh no!

1654
02:23:15,106 --> 02:23:24,210
MATT: We're living in the broken future of
technology. Thank you for your patience. So as

1655
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:27,242
Kynan's avoiding eye contact with Keyleth and
getting progressively drunk as the evening goes

1656
02:23:27,242 --> 02:23:33,581
on, occasionally, you see him smile hearing other
bits of conversation. The positive presence, at

1657
02:23:33,581 --> 02:23:40,475
least, of you guys being somewhat forgiving in the
moment and the fact that Percy did come back

1658
02:23:40,475 --> 02:23:46,273
alleviated some of his guilt. He's doing better
than he was earlier, definitely, but he's still

1659
02:23:46,273 --> 02:23:48,014
very inward.

1660
02:23:48,014 --> 02:23:56,018
Jarett is having hilarious conversation with Grog
as it progresses. (slurred) "It is great to have

1661
02:23:56,018 --> 02:24:04,371
"all of you back, and I hope my hometown was very
kind to all of you. I do miss it, and perhaps when

1662
02:24:04,371 --> 02:24:08,060
"all this is said and done and I can get 
a proper-- maybe a writ of approval

1663
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:14,646
"from you folks here at Whitestone. 
Maybe they can absolve me of a couple of things

1664
02:24:14,646 --> 02:24:17,501
"on the books I would like to say goodbye to."

1665
02:24:17,501 --> 02:24:20,099
TRAVIS: (slurred) I can't understand what you're
saying.

1666
02:24:20,099 --> 02:24:24,647
MATT: (slurred) "I can't understand what I'm
saying. Where did you get this?"

1667
02:24:24,647 --> 02:24:26,215
TRAVIS: (slurred) It is the best!

1668
02:24:26,215 --> 02:24:27,980
MATT: (slurred) "It's pretty great."

1669
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:29,112
ASHLEY: What is it?

1670
02:24:29,112 --> 02:24:30,084
LAURA: Oh, Pike!

1671
02:24:30,084 --> 02:24:31,453
MARISHA: Pike, you have to try some!

1672
02:24:31,453 --> 02:24:33,481
TRAVIS: (slurred) Pike, do you want a little bit?

1673
02:24:33,481 --> 02:24:37,439
MATT: (slurred) "You have to have some. It's not
very tasty, I'll tell you that,

1674
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:40,604
"but let me tell you, what it will do is this."

1675
02:24:40,604 --> 02:24:43,673
ASHLEY: That's okay. You don't drink alcohol for
the taste.

1676
02:24:43,673 --> 02:24:47,238
TRAVIS: That's my monster! And I pour her a little
glass.

1677
02:24:47,238 --> 02:24:50,701
MATT: All right. Do you down the shot, Pike?

1678
02:24:50,701 --> 02:24:52,727
ASHLEY: Well, yeah!

1679
02:24:52,727 --> 02:24:54,855
(laughter)

1680
02:24:54,855 --> 02:24:56,837
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw!

1681
02:24:56,837 --> 02:24:59,172
ASHLEY: I came to party!

1682
02:24:59,172 --> 02:25:04,161
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution saving
throw, Pike.

1683
02:25:04,161 --> 02:25:09,551
ASHLEY: Oh boy. Here we go.

1684
02:25:09,551 --> 02:25:11,785
LIAM: (singing) Turn down for Pike!

1685
02:25:11,785 --> 02:25:15,790
(singing)

1686
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:19,207
TRAVIS: That was the whitest drop-in beat ever.

1687
02:25:19,207 --> 02:25:21,540
ASHLEY: 15.

1688
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:26,688
MATT: 15? Pike downs it. It burns in her stomach,
and she takes it.

1689
02:25:26,688 --> 02:25:28,146
TRAVIS: What?!

1690
02:25:28,146 --> 02:25:32,252
LAURA: Seriously? Pike, you're such a badass!

1691
02:25:32,252 --> 02:25:36,101
TRAVIS: (slurred) How do you feel, Pike?

1692
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:43,061
ASHLEY: I feel like it didn't taste any different
than what I usually have.

1693
02:25:43,061 --> 02:25:45,546
Throw me off another one!

1694
02:25:45,546 --> 02:25:48,614
TRAVIS: I pour her another one.

1695
02:25:48,614 --> 02:25:50,812
MATT: All right. Make another saving throw, Pike.

1696
02:25:50,812 --> 02:25:57,170
ASHLEY: Oh shit. (laughs) I just rolled a one!

1697
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:59,386
(laughter)

1698
02:25:59,386 --> 02:26:06,627
MATT: So Pike takes the second shot, slams the
drink down on the table. You feel the numbness hit

1699
02:26:06,627 --> 02:26:16,573
your lips, Pike, and you feel a little strange, a
little sparkly and numb for a second. Your tongue

1700
02:26:16,573 --> 02:26:20,170
isn't quite functioning as you would hope as
everyone's looking towards you.

1701
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:25,280
(slurred) "A second shot? That is obviously 
very brave of you, Pike."

1702
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,480
TRAVIS: (slurred) Yes, she's got quite the
tolerance.

1703
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:33,216
ASHLEY: Well, I thought it-- I don't even know...
(garbled speech)

1704
02:26:33,216 --> 02:26:34,807
(laughter)

1705
02:26:34,807 --> 02:26:38,192
MATT: And with that, Pike faceplants onto the
ground and passes the fuck out.

1706
02:26:38,192 --> 02:26:40,680
(laughter)

1707
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,615
LAURA: Oh no, Pike!

1708
02:26:44,615 --> 02:26:48,614
TRAVIS: (slurred) Pike? Pike.

1709
02:26:48,614 --> 02:26:51,982
ASHLEY: I got too cocky.

1710
02:26:51,982 --> 02:26:58,751
TRAVIS: Can I try to pick her up by her collar and
try to hold her up? Is she just limp?

1711
02:26:58,751 --> 02:27:01,644
MATT: She's limp in your grasp, man. She's snoring
loudly, too.

1712
02:27:01,644 --> 02:27:04,760
TRAVIS: (slurred) Well, that's one way to go for
the night.

1713
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:10,204
MATT: (slurred) "I think this is an important
lesson for all of us-- at least the two of us--

1714
02:27:10,204 --> 02:27:11,477
"no more of that."

1715
02:27:11,477 --> 02:27:15,051
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. I put it in the bag of holding.
(slurred) Did you know that it comes from a

1716
02:27:15,051 --> 02:27:17,281
venomous part of a big animal?

1717
02:27:17,281 --> 02:27:21,101
MATT: (slurred) "You should have prefaced that 
before we had a drink."

1718
02:27:21,101 --> 02:27:23,704
TRAVIS: (slurred) Didn't I say that? That was my fault.

1719
02:27:23,704 --> 02:27:25,712
MATT: (slurred) "It's fine. Too late now."

1720
02:27:25,712 --> 02:27:30,152
TRAVIS: I go lay Pike in a booth or something.

1721
02:27:30,152 --> 02:27:31,655
MATT: She's slumped over.

1722
02:27:31,655 --> 02:27:33,907
(laughter)

1723
02:27:33,907 --> 02:27:37,314
MATT: Anything else you guys wish to accomplish
while drinking?

1724
02:27:37,314 --> 02:27:38,657
Or do you want to call it a night?

1725
02:27:38,657 --> 02:27:41,070
SAM: Do we need to talk about our plans, or are we
waiting for Percy for that?

1726
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:43,564
LIAM: Wait for the brain.

1727
02:27:43,564 --> 02:27:45,012
LAURA: I know, right?

1728
02:27:45,012 --> 02:27:46,284
TRAVIS: I'm over here.

1729
02:27:46,284 --> 02:27:49,885
SAM: I'll pull Jarett aside real quick, if that's
all right.

1730
02:27:49,885 --> 02:27:54,126
LAURA: Can I check out that letter that I found on
Percy's--

1731
02:27:54,126 --> 02:27:56,485
TALIESIN: I'm going to fucking kill you.

1732
02:27:56,485 --> 02:28:03,447
SAM: Well, while she reads, I pull Jarett aside
and I say: Listen, I know you've had legal

1733
02:28:03,447 --> 02:28:12,085
troubles before in your homeland, but we're
buddy-buddy with the leader now. In fact, I have

1734
02:28:12,085 --> 02:28:17,483
this symbol. They gave me this symbol.

1735
02:28:17,483 --> 02:28:23,410
MATT: (slurred) "Look, Scanlan, I've known you
long enough to know that you are

1736
02:28:23,410 --> 02:28:24,949
"a master of tall tales."

1737
02:28:24,949 --> 02:28:32,085
SAM: This is the gods' honest truth, man. This is
a real deal. This is diplomatic immunity, man.

1738
02:28:32,085 --> 02:28:34,822
I can get you off!

1739
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:39,392
MATT: (slurred) "I honestly don't even know if you're real
right now. I am so fucked up on this."

1740
02:28:39,392 --> 02:28:43,382
TRAVIS: (slurred) Jarett, I'd listen to him. It's
not very often he offers to get people off.

1741
02:28:43,382 --> 02:28:47,610
MATT: (slurred) "You're telling me that you've made friends
with J'mon Sa Ord."

1742
02:28:47,658 --> 02:28:59,216
SAM: We met them in their palace, and we're 
pretty tight now, so I bet I could get you

1743
02:28:59,216 --> 02:29:01,192
free and clear.

1744
02:29:01,192 --> 02:29:02,823
MATT: (slurred) "Then please do."

1745
02:29:02,823 --> 02:29:06,395
(laughter)

1746
02:29:06,395 --> 02:29:08,635
SAM: Will you do something for me?

1747
02:29:08,635 --> 02:29:14,960
MATT: (slurred) "If it is within my ability, as
your employee, of course."

1748
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:18,955
SAM: You're a man who knows things, knows 
how to get things.

1749
02:29:18,955 --> 02:29:20,791
MATT: (slurred) "Depending, maybe."

1750
02:29:20,791 --> 02:29:26,743
SAM: I was a little disappointed with the
samplings in your home. I was wondering if around

1751
02:29:26,743 --> 02:29:30,976
here, you couldn't find me a little
something-something.

1752
02:29:30,976 --> 02:29:34,685
MATT: (slurred) "What?"

1753
02:29:34,685 --> 02:29:41,295
SAM: A little pick-me-up? A little ride? A little
dipsy doodle?

1754
02:29:41,295 --> 02:29:45,666
(laughter)

1755
02:29:45,666 --> 02:29:51,448
SAM: Drugs, man. Drugs. I want drugs. I want you
to go find me drugs. Listen, I've had a really

1756
02:29:51,448 --> 02:29:55,885
rough time. I saw my friend die. We found the body
of another friend.

1757
02:29:55,885 --> 02:29:58,815
MATT: (slurred) "I understand that. I don't really
deal with these things."

1758
02:29:58,815 --> 02:30:00,986
SAM: But you know people who know people.

1759
02:30:00,986 --> 02:30:02,456
MATT: (slurred) "Not here in Whitestone!"

1760
02:30:02,456 --> 02:30:04,835
SAM: I'm going to get you cleared of murder, man!

1761
02:30:04,835 --> 02:30:09,196
MATT: (slurred) "Look, if you want to get some
suude, go down to the Turst Fields,

1762
02:30:09,196 --> 02:30:10,910
"or maybe over in Kymal."

1763
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:14,340
SAM: What were those words? The thirst feels?

1764
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:18,538
MATT: (slurred) "The Turst Fields! South of the
Alabaster Sierras."

1765
02:30:18,538 --> 02:30:22,236
SAM: There's way too many S's in what you just
said!

1766
02:30:22,236 --> 02:30:24,892
MATT: (slurred) "Looking for drugs, yes?"

1767
02:30:24,892 --> 02:30:25,807
SAM: Yes.

1768
02:30:25,807 --> 02:30:27,088
MATT: (slurred) "Get some suude!"

1769
02:30:27,088 --> 02:30:30,246
SAM: Some thuude?

1770
02:30:30,288 --> 02:30:32,128
MATT: (slurred) "Suude!"

1771
02:30:32,128 --> 02:30:37,379
SAM: I don't know what you're saying! Spell it!

1772
02:30:37,379 --> 02:30:42,067
MATT: (slurred) "S-U-U-D-E. Suude."

1773
02:30:42,067 --> 02:30:43,065
SAM: Suude.

1774
02:30:43,065 --> 02:30:44,169
MATT: (slurred) "Yeah, suude!"

1775
02:30:44,169 --> 02:30:46,058
(laughter)

1776
02:30:46,058 --> 02:30:47,756
SAM: What is that? Is that place? Is that a
person?

1777
02:30:47,756 --> 02:30:49,075
MATT: (slurred) "No, it's a drug!"

1778
02:30:49,075 --> 02:30:51,978
(laughter)

1779
02:30:51,978 --> 02:30:54,312
MATT: (slurred) "What did-- do you even know 
what you're asking me for?"

1780
02:30:54,312 --> 02:30:57,314
SAM: I don't! I don't know it at all!

1781
02:30:57,314 --> 02:30:59,217
MATT: (slurred) "You confuse me, gnome."

1782
02:30:59,217 --> 02:31:01,147
SAM: I am confused, too!

1783
02:31:01,147 --> 02:31:06,322
MATT: (slurred) "Look, as your employee, this is 
a very uncomfortable conversation to have."

1784
02:31:06,322 --> 02:31:10,813
SAM: This will not affect our professional
relationship one bit. You have my word.

1785
02:31:10,813 --> 02:31:15,313
MATT: (slurred) "I can send a courier, maybe, 
but that's very highly illegal stuff.

1786
02:31:15,313 --> 02:31:19,798
"Mind you, to be fair, the prison where they 
put you is currently being sat on

a time to buy, this would be it."

1788
02:31:22,364 --> 02:31:23,596
SAM: There you go!

1789
02:31:23,596 --> 02:31:29,021
MATT: (slurred) "Look, I'm in charge, of well,
that!" And you look over.

02:31:29,021 --> 02:31:35,012
Kynan's face-down on the table, trashed.
(slurred) "In charge of that, now, apparently.

people. I cannot do this myself.

"It would not behoove our current state 
here in Whitestone. I could ask around,

1793
02:31:47,406 --> 02:31:50,370
maybe send somebody. It'll be a while. 
I can't get you suude here in Whitestone!"

1794
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:53,276
SAM: It's okay. Just try your best.

1795
02:31:53,276 --> 02:31:55,013
MATT: "All right."

1796
02:31:55,013 --> 02:31:56,465
SAM: I believe in you.

(laughter)

1799
02:32:00,559 --> 02:32:02,930
SAM: (lisping) You're the best.

1800
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:06,107
MATT: (slurred) "Now you're just making fun of
me."

1801
02:32:06,107 --> 02:32:10,410
SAM: No. I'm going to clear your name, man. I'm
your ticket to freedom.

1802
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:13,410
MATT: (slurred) "I'll go and get you some suude."

SAM: Thank you.

MATT: "You're welcome."

1805

SAM: That would make me so happy.

MATT: (slurred) "That's all I want. Be pleased."

(laughter)

1808

LIAM: Vax paid attention to that entire
conversation.

1809
02:32:28,424 --> 02:32:38,516
MATT: Eventually, Jarett: 
(slurred) "All right, I need to sleep this off,

See you in the morning."

LAURA: Good night.

MATT: He stumbles his way out the door frame into
the Whitestone night. Anything else you guys wish

1813
02:32:51,477 --> 02:32:53,513
to accomplish tonight, or are you going to go
ahead and get some sleep?

MARISHA: I was looking anxiously over at Vex when
she was--

LAURA: Oh, this? Oh. Well, I suppose I'm a
horrible person, so you might as well be, too.

1816
02:33:06,488 --> 02:33:08,941
TRAVIS: What, you read it?

1817
02:33:08,941 --> 02:33:10,786
LAURA: This?

1818
02:33:10,786 --> 02:33:11,743
TRAVIS: Yep.

1819
02:33:11,743 --> 02:33:13,175
LIAM: What is it?

1820
02:33:13,175 --> 02:33:15,848
LAURA: It's a letter. It's a goodbye letter from
Percy to us.

1821
02:33:15,848 --> 02:33:17,612
TRAVIS: A what?

1822
02:33:17,612 --> 02:33:27,384
LAURA: I feel like it's a bit of an invasion. I
probably shouldn't have done that.

1823
02:33:27,384 --> 02:33:30,192
SAM: It's weirdly Patrick Rothfuss's voice,
though.

1824
02:33:30,192 --> 02:33:33,388
(laughter)

1825
02:33:33,388 --> 02:33:37,379
SAM: (Rothfuss voice) Dear Vox Machina, it's me,
Percy.

1826
02:33:37,379 --> 02:33:42,405
TRAVIS: Are we all reading it, or just you two
pricks?

1827
02:33:42,405 --> 02:33:44,968
MATT: Just read it out loud at that point.

1828
02:33:44,968 --> 02:33:48,259
TALIESIN: Only those of you who don't care about
my privacy.

1829
02:33:48,259 --> 02:33:50,932
LIAM: Taliesin, would you like this to be in your
voice?

1830
02:33:50,932 --> 02:33:53,153
TALIESIN: No! It was never supposed to be in my
voice.

1831
02:33:53,153 --> 02:33:57,490
LIAM: "My friends, I have just taken an audience
with the Raven Queen, who has snuffed any hope of

1832
02:33:57,490 --> 02:34:03,947
"my redemption, for which I am truly grateful. With new
clarity, I can finally see my life as a series of

1833
02:34:03,947 --> 02:34:10,852
"compounding poor choices. There was nothing I
could have done to save my family, yet I still

1834
02:34:10,852 --> 02:34:17,127
"sold my soul in search of vengeance. Later, I
allowed Ripley to leave, knowing full well she was

1835
02:34:17,127 --> 02:34:23,447
"a greater threat to the world than the Briarwoods
would ever be. I traded the world's safety for the

1836
02:34:23,447 --> 02:34:30,181
"belief that I could murder my way to peace, that
if I could be a greater horror, it would bring my

1837
02:34:30,181 --> 02:34:36,507
"family back. Once this lie was shattered, I
scrambled to find a solution, to make a deal, to

1838
02:34:36,507 --> 02:34:43,894
"undo my mistakes and balance the scales. I now
understand that there are no scales. There is no

1839
02:34:43,894 --> 02:34:49,861
"redemption, and no ledger that judges me good or
evil. I am free to simply be myself and live with

1840
02:34:49,861 --> 02:34:52,595
"the terrible mistakes I've made.

1841
02:34:52,595 --> 02:34:59,408
"Tomorrow, I start upon a new path beyond the gods
and demons who have tormented me, and it's your

1842
02:34:59,408 --> 02:35:05,923
"friendship that makes this possible. Though a
shadow lingers, the need for vengeance is gone.

1843
02:35:05,923 --> 02:35:13,190
"I will try and do my best for you all. I will strive
to buy the future more time free of my legacy.

1844
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:22,149
"I will stand against the children of my madness
in hope, rather than in anger. And if you are

1845
02:35:22,149 --> 02:35:27,506
"reading this, then my travels on this path have
come to an end.

1846
02:35:27,506 --> 02:35:34,032
"Scanlan, thank you for destroying my gun. Do not
let the weight of life's consequences crush your

1847
02:35:34,032 --> 02:35:36,290
"bravado. It is your greatest weapon.

1848
02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:44,874
"Grog, remember that your compassion has brought
you this far, not just strength. For the record,

1849
02:35:44,874 --> 02:35:48,500
"I would have wiped the floor with you that time.

1850
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:56,753
"Vax, you often remind me of myself, and yes, I
know that that is a bit of an insult. Stop

1851
02:35:56,753 --> 02:36:01,358
"indulging your desire to sacrifice and try being
the man that these two women seem to think you

1852
02:36:01,358 --> 02:36:05,418
"are. They may actually need you one day.

1853
02:36:05,418 --> 02:36:14,216
"Vex, you often remind me of myself, and that is
the highest of compliments." Oh, true to form,

1854
02:36:14,216 --> 02:36:19,622
Percival, true to form. "I hope you free yourself
of whatever voices haunt you. Also, since I'm

1855
02:36:19,622 --> 02:36:24,108
"gone, you're the clever one now." Still the clever
one.

1856
02:36:24,108 --> 02:36:30,059
"Keyleth, don't let the world break you. Learn to
forgive it for not living up to your standards.

1857
02:36:30,059 --> 02:36:31,814
"We promise to try harder."

1858
02:36:31,814 --> 02:36:34,313
MARISHA: (chuckles) Smartass.

1859
02:36:34,313 --> 02:36:41,065
LIAM: "Pike, it is wonderful to have you home. You
bring everyone closer to their best selves, and I

1860
02:36:41,065 --> 02:36:48,020
"can only imagine what a burden that must be." Oh,
she's out. "Allow yourself some vice and failure.

1861
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:53,545
"Done and done. They'll still love you just the
same. All true.

1862
02:36:53,545 --> 02:37:00,499
"As to what must be done, I'd be content to be left
in a ditch, my weapons and notes burnt and broken."

1863
02:37:00,499 --> 02:37:08,727
Fucker. "But I imagine that would upset Cass. If
you can, take me home. If you can't, I understand.

1864
02:37:08,727 --> 02:37:13,679
"She knows where to find the rest of my
instructions. Times being what they are, burn my

1865
02:37:13,679 --> 02:37:17,377
"work or bring it home in the hopes of aiding in
the defense of Whitestone.

1866
02:37:17,377 --> 02:37:23,330
"I leave this judgment in your capable hands.
Please find Ripley before she does too many

1867
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:29,405
"terrible things and erase my legacy wherever you
find it. That silence would be the greatest eulogy

1868
02:37:29,405 --> 02:37:40,257
"I could ever hope for." Oh dear. "With eternal
gratitude, Percival of Vox Machina."

1869
02:37:40,257 --> 02:37:43,450
TRAVIS: I'm going to kick his fucking ass.

1870
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:48,187
SAM: Why? He didn't mention you, did he?

1871
02:37:48,187 --> 02:37:54,244
TRAVIS: Yeah, he did! He said he could have wiped
the floor with me!

1872
02:37:54,244 --> 02:37:56,230
SAM: Well, I'm sure it was a joke, friend.

1873
02:37:56,230 --> 02:38:01,405
LIAM: Yeah, that's a very highbrow kind of humor.
It's hilarious. I promise it's hilarious.

1874
02:38:01,405 --> 02:38:02,617
TRAVIS: Highbrowed?

1875
02:38:02,617 --> 02:38:08,620
LIAM: Yeah. It means stuffy. Boring. Boring
humor.

1876
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:10,109
ASHLEY: Am I still out?

1877
02:38:10,109 --> 02:38:12,304
MATT: You're still out. You're done for the
night.

1878
02:38:12,304 --> 02:38:13,786
(laughter)

1879
02:38:13,786 --> 02:38:19,758
MATT: Actually, you know what? Roll a perception
check. With disadvantage.

1880
02:38:19,758 --> 02:38:29,273
SAM: Well, you should not have taken that note.

1881
02:38:29,273 --> 02:38:32,690
LAURA: Well, I know. I was searching for something
important.

1882
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:35,214
MATT: 12? You're passed out. You don't hear
anything.

1883
02:38:35,214 --> 02:38:38,447
LAURA: I just realized I still had it, is all.

1884
02:38:38,447 --> 02:38:42,785
TRAVIS: So do we plan to act like we didn't read
it, or are you going to try and slip it back

1885
02:38:42,785 --> 02:38:44,613
in his pocket without him noticing?

1886
02:38:44,613 --> 02:38:46,116
LAURA: What do you guys think?

1887
02:38:46,116 --> 02:38:50,718
LIAM: That's a good point. I balance a tray 
on top of Pike's prone form

1888
02:38:50,718 --> 02:38:52,578
and put some cups on top of it.

1889
02:38:52,578 --> 02:38:55,786
LAURA: Should I pretend I didn't read it? Should I
pretend I didn't take it?

1890
02:38:55,786 --> 02:38:57,180
TRAVIS: Was it sealed or anything?

1891
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:58,687
LAURA: No, it's just folded.

1892
02:38:58,687 --> 02:39:02,117
TRAVIS: Yeah. Try and sneak it in.

1893
02:39:02,117 --> 02:39:03,185
LAURA: All right.

1894
02:39:03,185 --> 02:39:06,522
LIAM: I put a tray on top of the cups on top of
the first tray.

1895
02:39:06,522 --> 02:39:12,912
MARISHA: But now we go forward with the knowledge
that we know Percy was anticipating dying?

1896
02:39:12,912 --> 02:39:15,511
SAM: Well, aren't we all anticipating dying?

1897
02:39:15,511 --> 02:39:19,130
LAURA: Technically, we should all write these
letters.

1898
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:23,666
LIAM: That's Percival up and down. There's nothing
really that surprising in the letter, really.

1899
02:39:23,666 --> 02:39:26,416
TRAVIS: Don't know if we all need to write.

1900
02:39:26,416 --> 02:39:29,124
LAURA: Grog, you can draw some pictures for us.

1901
02:39:29,124 --> 02:39:32,776
LIAM: More cups on top of the second tray.

1902
02:39:32,776 --> 02:39:40,445
SAM: The fact is, we all might die at any point,
and it would be terrible, and we should enjoy

1903
02:39:40,445 --> 02:39:42,281
every day that we have together.

1904
02:39:42,281 --> 02:39:43,619
LIAM: That's right. Third tray.

1905
02:39:43,619 --> 02:39:45,120
MATT: Make a dexterity check, Vax.

1906
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:49,008
LIAM: No problem. 24.

1907
02:39:49,008 --> 02:39:53,159
MATT: 24. The stack is beautifully balanced. It's
rotating a little bit.

1908
02:39:53,159 --> 02:39:54,954
LAURA: You better hope she doesn't move.

1909
02:39:54,954 --> 02:39:57,280
LIAM: I stand and admire my own work.

1910
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:01,985
TRAVIS: I walk up and shove Vax into the tray of
glasses.

1911
02:40:01,985 --> 02:40:07,289
MATT: As he's admiring it, you get a sudden push
forward and clacking. All the trays and glasses

1912
02:40:07,289 --> 02:40:11,110
fall and hit the ground. You hear the metal and
the brass (clanging).

1913
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:13,685
LAURA: Did it wake her up?

1914
02:40:13,685 --> 02:40:21,350
MATT: Pike stirs. You wake up, still trashed,
Pike, and your lips numb as ever, but you're back

1915
02:40:21,350 --> 02:40:23,796
to consciousness now, hearing all this clattering
around you.

1916
02:40:23,796 --> 02:40:25,837
LIAM: Hey! Did you know that I'm--

1917
02:40:25,837 --> 02:40:31,459
ASHLEY: I just tried to stealth!

1918
02:40:31,459 --> 02:40:33,109
LIAM: What?

1919
02:40:33,109 --> 02:40:35,598
ASHLEY: Too loud.

1920
02:40:35,598 --> 02:40:40,550
LIAM: You are drunk! You are very drunk!

1921
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:41,785
ASHLEY: Oh!

1922
02:40:41,785 --> 02:40:46,146
LAURA: We should head back to the castle.

1923
02:40:46,146 --> 02:40:49,007
LIAM: Yeah. Grog, you want to pick up Pickle and
let's go get some sleep?

1924
02:40:49,007 --> 02:40:52,430
TRAVIS: Pike, what did you do to all these cups
and trays?

1925
02:40:52,430 --> 02:40:55,391
ASHLEY: Did I do that?

1926
02:40:55,391 --> 02:41:01,794
TRAVIS: Yes! I'm very disappointed. You should
apologize to the owner.

1927
02:41:01,794 --> 02:41:04,981
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, owner.

1928
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:06,773
(laughter)

1929
02:41:06,773 --> 02:41:10,690
MATT: The older woman over in the corner who owns
the bar is like, "It's fine."

1930
02:41:10,690 --> 02:41:13,070
TRAVIS: I flip her a gold coin.

1931
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:17,933
MATT: She watches it hit the ground and goes,
"Thanks."

1932
02:41:17,933 --> 02:41:22,151
TRAVIS: Welcome. All right, let's go home! I pick
up Pikey.

1933
02:41:22,151 --> 02:41:28,760
MATT: All right. You guys find your way back to
Whitestone Castle to your respective rooms.

1934
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:31,310
LAURA: No. I sneak into Percy's room.

1935
02:41:31,310 --> 02:41:33,880
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

1936
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:38,339
LIAM: Turn down for what.

1937
02:41:38,339 --> 02:41:40,311
LAURA: (sings) 
Shit, why? I'm sorry!

1938
02:41:40,311 --> 02:41:42,953
SAM and LAURA: (continue singing)

1939
02:41:42,953 --> 02:41:45,401
LAURA: 29.

1940
02:41:45,401 --> 02:41:52,730
MATT: 29. Yeah, no. Percy does not seem to notice
you. He's snoring loudly face down in his

1941
02:41:52,730 --> 02:42:00,651
still-set bed, (snoring) in the bed itself. The
room is dark, but you can still see fine.

1942
02:42:00,651 --> 02:42:08,317
LAURA: I'm not going to shove it in his butt, all
right? Can I try to reach under and get it into

1943
02:42:08,317 --> 02:42:09,903
the pocket in the coat?

1944
02:42:09,903 --> 02:42:11,701
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a sleight of hand
check.

1945
02:42:11,701 --> 02:42:13,210
SAM: Reaching around?

1946
02:42:13,210 --> 02:42:16,533
(laughter)

1947
02:42:16,533 --> 02:42:18,671
TALIESIN: I love you all so much.

1948
02:42:18,671 --> 02:42:24,922
LAURA: Sleight of hand? Seven plus 15 is--

1949
02:42:24,922 --> 02:42:30,277
MATT: 22. Percival, I need you to roll 
a perception check with disadvantage.

1950
02:42:30,277 --> 02:42:33,347
TALIESIN: Full disadvantage, or the new
disadvantage?

1951
02:42:33,347 --> 02:42:35,458
SAM: You're dead. You're essentially 
a dead person.

1952
02:42:35,458 --> 02:42:38,619
MATT: You are in the sleep of the dead right now,
so you're rolling with disadvantage,

1953
02:42:38,619 --> 02:42:40,246
and whatever you roll, minus four.

1954
02:42:40,246 --> 02:42:46,355
TALIESIN: Minus four. Perception?

1955
02:42:46,355 --> 02:42:48,341
MATT: Yes.

1956
02:42:48,341 --> 02:42:51,367
TALIESIN: 13.

1957
02:42:51,367 --> 02:42:59,150
MATT: A couple moments of snoring, and you stop
and you wait for the breathing to continue, and

1958
02:42:59,150 --> 02:43:05,022
you find the coat pocket where you found it,
gently slip the letter in with the notes that you

1959
02:43:05,022 --> 02:43:10,244
found it with, close it, step away.

1960
02:43:10,244 --> 02:43:16,480
LAURA: I tell him: I'm glad you're back. And I
leave the room.

1961
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:19,352
MATT: Okay. You gently close the door. No issue.

1962
02:43:19,352 --> 02:43:21,218
LIAM: Cucumber sandwiches...

1963
02:43:21,218 --> 02:43:24,885
LAURA: Oh, so this is yours. Here, 
I don't need it any more.

1964
02:43:24,885 --> 02:43:29,824
(laughter)

1965
02:43:29,824 --> 02:43:36,627
MATT: All right. As you guys go to rest for the
evening, sleep takes you eventually, some of you

1966
02:43:36,627 --> 02:43:44,115
longer than others, because you woke up not too
long before. Sunrise comes in Castle Whitestone

1967
02:43:44,115 --> 02:43:50,524
once again. The previously somewhat cloudy day is
now a very gray sky day. There is a slight mist in

1968
02:43:50,524 --> 02:43:54,434
the air. Looking out over the forest from the
windows, you can see that the forest itself has a

1969
02:43:54,434 --> 02:44:00,915
very thick, low fog and mist that does cover
portions of it. It's a cold, cold morning and it's

1970
02:44:00,915 --> 02:44:03,101
a brisk way to wake up.

1971
02:44:03,101 --> 02:44:10,342
As you guys all begin to come down to eat your
meal for the morning as the guards go about

1972
02:44:10,342 --> 02:44:17,812
business within the castle, Seeker Asum comes 
into the room with you guys and goes,

1973
02:44:17,812 --> 02:44:26,146
"I am sorry to intrude. There is some 
new information while you were gone

1974
02:44:26,146 --> 02:44:30,691
"that I would like to discuss with you. When you 
finish eating, we'll meet in the war room.

1975
02:44:30,691 --> 02:44:37,369
"I'll be waiting for you." He leaves, 
looking a little spooked.

1976
02:44:37,369 --> 02:44:41,082
SAM: That's ominous.

1977
02:44:41,082 --> 02:44:42,764
LIAM: Let's throw it back and go.

1978
02:44:42,764 --> 02:44:45,048
SAM: Yeah, let's chug and go.

1979
02:44:45,048 --> 02:44:50,022
MATT: Okay. You guys finish your meal as fast as
you can. You head up and meet in the war room.

1980
02:44:50,022 --> 02:44:55,028
LAURA: The war room down by the orb?

1981
02:44:55,028 --> 02:45:00,556
MATT: No, this is actually a meeting room in the
castle that has been converted into a war room for

1982
02:45:00,556 --> 02:45:06,203
planning and such. This is where you met with
Cassandra and Allura and people in the past to

1983
02:45:06,203 --> 02:45:12,209
discuss about important matters. You come into the
room. There's the big window facing out across

1984
02:45:12,209 --> 02:45:16,777
Whitestone on the second floor for this room.
There's the table in the center, and Asum is

1985
02:45:16,777 --> 02:45:21,967
sitting there, fingers steepled, looking at the
table. "Thank you. Please, come in.

1986
02:45:21,967 --> 02:45:24,402
"Close the door behind you. I think 
we should have some privacy for this."

1987
02:45:24,402 --> 02:45:28,506
MARISHA: Very foreboding, Asum.

1988
02:45:28,506 --> 02:45:31,244
MATT: "This is an important conversation."

1989
02:45:31,244 --> 02:45:33,387
LAURA: Should we have this downstairs, then?

1990
02:45:33,387 --> 02:45:36,879
MATT: "I'd prefer to have it here, in private."

1991
02:45:36,879 --> 02:45:39,155
LIAM: Out with it.

1992
02:45:39,155 --> 02:45:48,687
MATT: Asum stands up for a second and goes, 
"Thank you for coming. I think it's time

1993
02:45:48,687 --> 02:45:50,887
"we discuss something of extreme importance."

1994
02:45:50,887 --> 02:45:52,020
LAURA: I want to insight.

1995
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:53,121
MARISHA: I agree.

1996
02:45:53,121 --> 02:45:54,543
MATT: Go for it. Insight checks.

1997
02:45:54,543 --> 02:45:55,763
SAM: He hasn't even said anything yet.

1998
02:45:55,763 --> 02:45:56,715
LAURA: I don't care.

1999
02:45:56,715 --> 02:45:58,443
MARISHA: He's being really shifty.

2000
02:45:58,443 --> 02:46:00,464
LAURA: 27.

2001
02:46:00,464 --> 02:46:03,468
SAM: Ooh, whispers.

2002
02:46:03,468 --> 02:46:07,168
MARISHA: Also 27.

2003
02:46:07,168 --> 02:46:08,942
LAURA and LIAM: Ooh!

2004
02:46:08,942 --> 02:46:12,502
TALIESIN: Look at the big brain on Brad.

2005
02:46:12,502 --> 02:46:22,985
SAM: Hello. I am Loot Crate. Please buy me. 
Oh, hold on, Matt's coming behind.

2006
02:46:22,985 --> 02:46:26,234
TALIESIN: That just got really awkward and really
weird.

2007
02:46:26,234 --> 02:46:31,199
LAURA: Don't you think? Ashley, I think we should
go down to the orb.

2008
02:46:31,199 --> 02:46:33,776
SAM: Ashley, I think you should move to 
Los Angeles.

2009
02:46:33,776 --> 02:46:35,344
LAURA: Ashley, come home.

2010
02:46:35,344 --> 02:46:44,404
SAM: Ashley, we all died. It's just you now. 
You versus the dragons.

2011
02:46:44,404 --> 02:46:48,103
MATT: Asum stands up, hands on the table.

2012
02:46:48,103 --> 02:46:54,084
MARISHA: Asum, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be
insistent here, but if this is as private of

2013
02:46:54,084 --> 02:46:59,221
information as you seem to be making it out to be,
maybe we should go to the room where we know

2014
02:46:59,221 --> 02:47:01,015
cannot be spied upon.

2015
02:47:01,015 --> 02:47:05,744
MATT: "I assure you, this room is safe. It's going
to be a brief discussion."

2016
02:47:05,744 --> 02:47:12,278
LAURA: I would feel more comfortable downstairs.
We talked about this.

2017
02:47:12,278 --> 02:47:23,956
MATT: "Before I continue, hear my words. 
Think before you act. I implore you.

2018
02:47:23,956 --> 02:47:31,257
"Understand that not all is what it seems, 
and I come to you as an ally."

2019
02:47:31,257 --> 02:47:36,176
TALIESIN: All right.

2020
02:47:36,176 --> 02:47:47,504
MATT: Asum's eyes flash a vibrant green for a
second and then become yellowish reptilian orbs.

2021
02:47:47,504 --> 02:48:07,625
You see a hint of green scales curl across the
face. "Now please, let us talk. Violence will not

2022
02:48:07,625 --> 02:48:17,978
"end in your favor. You have no plan, no trap. 
I am smarter, more prepared, and more powerful

2023
02:48:17,978 --> 02:48:20,234
"than all of you.

2024
02:48:20,234 --> 02:48:27,091
"I know of Whitestone. I know your tricks, and I
know your weaknesses. If I wished you destroyed

2025
02:48:27,091 --> 02:48:35,426
"right now, I could have done it a thousandfold
already. So consider the fact that we're even

2026
02:48:35,426 --> 02:48:42,565
"having this conversation is me putting forth 
a lot of effort and intent

2027
02:48:42,565 --> 02:48:48,856
"to have this discussion. No rash actions."

2028
02:48:48,856 --> 02:48:51,191
TALIESIN: Noted.

2029
02:48:51,191 --> 02:48:59,585
MATT: "Now, let us put our cards on the table,
shall we? I, as I'm sure you've noticed,

2030
02:48:59,585 --> 02:49:08,619
"am Raishan. It is a pleasure to meet you 
in person, slayers of the Hope Devourer

2031
02:49:08,619 --> 02:49:21,144
"and the Iron Storm. I need your help. 
I wish to kill the Cinder King."

2032
02:49:21,144 --> 02:49:22,886
And that's where we'll end tonight's session!

2033
02:49:22,886 --> 02:49:27,868
(screaming)

2034
02:49:27,868 --> 02:49:30,511
LIAM: You fucking Machiavelli!

2035
02:49:30,511 --> 02:49:34,618
TRAVIS: You came into our home with that shit?!

2036
02:49:34,618 --> 02:49:38,802
MARISHA: Fucking you come into our house!

2037
02:49:38,802 --> 02:49:44,821
LIAM: Wow. Look at that little boy smile. He's so
pleased.

2038
02:49:44,821 --> 02:49:46,969
MATT: And on time, 10:05.

2039
02:49:46,969 --> 02:49:48,207
LIAM: Wow!

2040
02:49:48,207 --> 02:49:51,319
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding?

2041
02:49:51,319 --> 02:49:54,363
LAURA: Wow.

2042
02:49:54,363 --> 02:49:56,638
TRAVIS: Okay.

2043
02:49:56,638 --> 02:50:04,117
MATT: There were a few holes in Asum's story when
he first got here nobody picked up on. Yeah.

2044
02:50:04,117 --> 02:50:06,189
TRAVIS: He's been this way the whole time?!

2045
02:50:06,189 --> 02:50:08,393
MATT: The whole time since he arrived in
Whitestone.

2046
02:50:08,393 --> 02:50:10,071
MARISHA: She's been posing as Seeker Asum.

2047
02:50:10,071 --> 02:50:14,104
LAURA: It's when he showed up and he's like-- 
you said something about transporting somewhere--

2048
02:50:14,104 --> 02:50:21,012
MATT: Yeah, there is no teleportation sigil to
Whitestone. That's why you guys had to travel

2049
02:50:21,012 --> 02:50:22,604
there on foot.

2050
02:50:22,604 --> 02:50:27,427
LIAM and TALIESIN: We're so smart.

2051
02:50:27,427 --> 02:50:30,464
SAM: We're like seven detectives.

2052
02:50:30,464 --> 02:50:32,658
TRAVIS: I knew that. I don't know if the rest of
you did.

2053
02:50:32,658 --> 02:50:35,537
SAM: He was just playing to his character's
intelligence.

2054
02:50:35,537 --> 02:50:42,300
MARISHA: But I also put a bracelet on the actual
Seeker Asum, so I should be able to scry on that

2055
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:44,348
guy. Find out where he is.

2056
02:50:44,348 --> 02:50:45,678
MATT: If you wish to, you can.

2057
02:50:45,678 --> 02:50:47,278
MARISHA: Hopefully, he's not dead.

2058
02:50:47,278 --> 02:50:50,586
MATT: Well, I guess we'll find out in the future.
Maybe we'll find out in the future.

2059
02:50:50,586 --> 02:50:51,985
TRAVIS: Thank you to Loot Crate.

2060
02:50:51,985 --> 02:50:53,389
LAURA: Hey, thanks, Loot Crate.

2061
02:50:53,389 --> 02:50:54,957
MATT: Thanks, Loot Crate. You guys are awesome!

2062
02:50:54,957 --> 02:50:56,856
LAURA: Thanks, Ashley!

2063
02:50:56,856 --> 02:50:59,795
MATT: Thank you, Ashley, for coming! You're
amazing!

2064
02:50:59,795 --> 02:51:01,863
TRAVIS: We set a crazy new record tonight.

2065
02:51:01,863 --> 02:51:05,515
MATT: Apparently. A lot of you guys came tonight
to watch the show. Thank you so much for coming

2066
02:51:05,515 --> 02:51:06,815
and watching.

2067
02:51:06,815 --> 02:51:09,644
MARISHA: And thank you to Patrick Rothfuss.

2068
02:51:09,644 --> 02:51:14,356
MATT: He's been planning that for a couple of
months with me.

2069
02:51:14,356 --> 02:51:17,488
MARISHA: Miss you, Kerr-bear.

2070
02:51:17,488 --> 02:51:22,064
MATT: Thank you guys for your patience with the
technical difficulties in the latter half of the

2071
02:51:22,064 --> 02:51:25,815
show. Hopefully we didn't miss anything on that.
We tried to make sure we got everything up to

2072
02:51:25,815 --> 02:51:30,132
speed with you guys. Thank you for being so
supportive of the show. We love you guys very

2073
02:51:30,132 --> 02:51:36,440
much. We'll see you in a week, and is it Thursday
yet? Have a good night, guys.

2074
02:51:36,440 --> 02:58:27,819
