00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:05,316
MATT: Welcome, and hello everyone to the next
episode of Critical Role. A silly show where a

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:09,657
bunch of us voice actors get together and play
Dungeons and Dragons on Geek and Sundry's twitch

3
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:14,726
stream. So for returning fans, welcome, and to all
the new folks tuning in finally, welcome to you as

4
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:21,427
well. So before we get into the meat, a few
announcements and such, let's roll that intro.

5
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:22,699
TRAVIS: Silly?

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:01:29,559
[dramatic music]

7
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:34,638
MATT: And welcome back. So, a couple things I want
to get off the bat to you guys. Our subscription

8
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:40,139
giveaways this evening. For every hundred
subscribers, we are giving away special care

9
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:45,140
packages with D&amp;D books signed by the Critical
Role crew, as well as a signed photo, comics,

10
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,126
other goodies. So the next one will be at 5,300,
we will do another giveaway. Remember, you have to

11
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:58,374
be in the chat room to be able to acquire one of
these packages. So tune in to get something. Keep

12
00:01:58,374 --> 00:01:59,483
that in mind.

13
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:00,650
LAURA: Yeah.

14
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,906
MATT: Also, for those who may not remember from
last week, we are in a very interesting month of

15
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:11,252
Critical Role, as the party has been split due to
a circumstance where, in the city of Vasselheim,

16
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:16,195
the party, chasing after a hydra that seemed to be
harrying the outside walls of the city and

17
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:22,631
slaying it, got in the way and accidentally broke
the laws of the Vasselheim by hunting and slaying

18
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:29,005
when they weren't approved to do so. Being called
skags by a band of hunters that works for the

19
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:34,062
Slayer's Take guildhall. A guild that pretty much
regulates most hunting of monsters and creatures

20
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:41,449
within the vicinity of Vasselheim. So, as opposed
to going up and dealing with charges at the seat

21
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:46,398
of justice, they instead were given the option by
the head of the guild hall to possibly join, but in

22
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:52,581
order to do so, they would have to fulfill a
contract and prove themselves worthy of being a

23
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:58,871
member of the guild. And the guild master, our
fantastic Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial, hand-picked

24
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:05,644
two different groups, splitting up the twins, and
they have all set out to return the next day to

25
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,268
join, and figure out what their contract will be.
So, this week we have playing: we have Grog. We

26
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:18,697
have Vex'ahlia. We have Percy. We have the 
shortly arriving here Scanlan,

27
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,383
who has been fighting L.A. traffic.

28
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,373
TRAVIS: He's here!

29
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,488
(cheering)

30
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:24,483
MATT: Quite literally shortly arriving, Scanlan.

31
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,681
TRAVIS: Like Superman, that was amazing.

32
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:37,540
MATT: And eventually to join the party as they
slowly make their way there-- mysterious head

33
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,056
kiss. This is the best Thursday ever. We have
joining us eventually at some point we have the

34
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:49,446
very wonderful and talented Mary Elizabeth
McGlynn. A fantastic, talented voice actress and

35
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,898
director and amazing person.

36
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,178
MARY: Hello, sorry.

37
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:58,756
MATT: So look her stuff up online. She is also a
great musician, singer, and this is her first time

38
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,392
playing Dungeons and Dragons.

39
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:01,572
TRAVIS: Newbie!

40
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:02,828
MARY: Newbie!

41
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,350
MATT: Yeah, I'm super excited.

42
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,626
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill you.

43
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:06,453
MARY: Yes.

44
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:12,401
MATT: Probably. And in the middle of the other
table, we have our other illustrious guest this

45
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,439
evening. The so-called headmaster of Geek and
Sundry herself, Felicia Day.

46
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,952
Thank you for joining us, Felicia.

47
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:19,897
(cheering)

48
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:21,818
FELICIA: I like to refer to myself as Duchess,
Grand Duchess.

49
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:23,145
MATT: Grand Duchess, also viable.

50
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:24,949
SAM: Golf claps.

51
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,668
FELICIA: Golf claps, very appropriate.

52
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,293
MATT: (laughs) So yeah, thank you so much for
joining.

53
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:33,910
FELICIA: I'm so excited to be here. I'm a huge fan
of the show, so I spend my

54
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,676
Thursdays watching you guys.

55
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,523
SAM: Who is your favorite character on the show?

56
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,236
LAURA: Say Trinket, say Trinket

57
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:42,098
FELICIA: Not the one with the scatological
problem.

58
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,957
SAM: I think of it more as a gift.

59
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:46,337
(laughter)

60
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,609
TALIESIN: That keeps giving and giving and...

61
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,895
MARY: The one who likes to talk to poo.

62
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:53,847
TRAVIS: Well that's a lot of us, actually.

63
00:04:53,847 --> 00:05:00,498
MATT: Before we get into the nitty gritty, do we
have any announcements we want to make? Anything

64
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,548
in particular coming up? I believe, Laura, you're
bolting at the end of the game.

65
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:08,057
LAURA: I'm leaving probably during the game, to
catch my flight to go to GenCon for the

66
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,154
Titansgrave panel. Tomorrow!

67
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:14,988
MATT: Yeah! Which for the record, I want to point
out guys, this is how much Laura loves you. She

68
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:19,377
was going to miss today's game but then bit the
bullet, changed her flight, just so she could be

69
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:20,606
here to play with everyone.

70
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:24,053
FELICIA: Golf claps.

71
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:28,854
LAURA: Well, after I saw my glorious Trinket
yesterday, there was no choice really.

72
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:33,718
MATT: (laughs) The Trinket that devours, by the
way. Every person that's hugged that bear has

73
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:39,437
vanished, temporarily, within its physical form.
It is a new wonderful addition to the chat room--

74
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:44,355
I mean to the whole show, and thank you to the
Critters for making that happen. It's ridiculous.

75
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:50,059
It's-- you guys are the best, I have no words.
Anything else anyone wants to announce?

76
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,314
Anything coming up?

77
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:57,067
MARY: I'm off to San Antonio tomorrow morning,
very early, for San Japan. With Steve Blum. So

78
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:00,077
come on out and have some fun in San Antonio.

79
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:03,750
MATT: Heck yeah. It's a great convention, I went
there last year. They're really, really good, so

80
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,768
all you folks out there.

81
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,024
MARY: We were both there last year.

82
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:06,994
MATT: That's right, we were.

83
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:07,987
MARY: Yes!

84
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:13,972
MATT: So go check out Mary in San Antonio. You
guys should go. Also, we've had a lot of questions

85
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:17,980
through twitter, from a lot of the fans, and I
like the idea of transparency, and mentioning how

86
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,667
first off, no game or game master is infallible
and rules do shift and change and there have been

87
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:29,701
a couple of minor alterations to the rules. Which,
you know, you house rule things in a game and you

88
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:33,695
test it out and balance can shift. For those who
have looked at the gunslinger martial archetype

89
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,793
that Percy plays with, I have made a few
adjustments to it, balancing out a few elements

90
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:40,548
there. DCs for different shots and--

91
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,921
TALIESIN: Definitely some foam darts that I'm
shooting now. That's all I'm saying. I'm saying

92
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:46,649
there is a lot of pump action and then a foam dart
comes out.

93
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,533
TRAVIS: Really?

94
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,244
TALIESIN: With a suction thing at the end.

95
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:56,545
MATT: You don't get foam darts until level 18.
That is a higher level ability. The noise happens

96
00:06:56,545 --> 00:07:01,905
at level 19-- you level up to get the actual
sound. So check out the gunslinger archetype,

97
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:07,677
there's been some changes to it. Also, for the
sorcerer points, we had house ruled a

98
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,902
configuration where sorcerer points would be one
point per spell level of spell cast. As the levels

99
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:16,604
got higher it got a little overpowered in some
combat circumstances, so we narrowed that down.

100
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,353
Which is still a bonus over the actual rules which
allow you to only cast one spell per round and a

101
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:27,663
cantrip. We made it so that you can cast, with
quickened spell, any spell and then a 2nd-level

102
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:31,133
spell maximum in the same round. Slight
variation.

103
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,596
LAURA: I don't understand anything you just said.

104
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:33,774
TALIESIN: Made no sense to me.

105
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,072
MARY: Two spells at once? Two spells.

106
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:39,258
MATT: That's okay. It's for the sorcerer, you
don't have to worry about it. Minor house rule

107
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:45,921
adjustments, so all you guys out there who GM and
DM don't be afraid to adjust balance as you go, as

108
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:51,397
long as you talk to the players about it. Anyway,
that's it and that's all on my end. Shall we

109
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,774
go ahead and begin?

110
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:54,763
TRAVIS: (loud maniacal laughter)

111
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:56,001
MATT: Calm down, Phillip.

112
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,437
TRAVIS: All right, but I'm not Phillip right now,
he lost. I'm a winner.

113
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,959
LAURA: Phillip doesn't exist anymore.

114
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,541
TRAVIS: (cries)

115
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,003
LAURA: Phillip's legacy is 1,000 gold to repay.

116
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,760
TRAVIS: Phillip is training to an 80s training
montage right now. In a beef locker somewhere.

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,421
MARY: Because everyone needs a montage.

118
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:13,605
TRAVIS: Yep.

119
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:18,312
MATT: Glorious. I think that is an important
circumstance. All right, so getting this started.

120
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:25,013
The party has found themselves in the city of
Vasselheim; a very deity and religion based city,

121
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:30,068
in a very harsh environment. It's far up
north in this continent and the weather itself is

122
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:36,064
very cold, the landscape is very harsh and rugged,
and outside of the city itself, there is an

123
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:42,620
extremely dark, oppressive, almost unnaturally
fast-growing forest known as the Vesper

124
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,093
Timberland. This is where you encountered the
hydra, last time. You just barely trekked out of the

125
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:53,683
the city and found that creature. Who knows what
else lies out there, but the city seems very well

126
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:57,118
prepared to defend itself against whatever
atrocities make their way towards the outskirts of

127
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:08,577
the city. So, after Grog fought very gloriously in
the Crucible and just barely lost due to a test of

128
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:15,173
strength that just didn't fall in his favor, he
sulked via ale and ladies back at the tavern.

129
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,525
TRAVIS: Yeah.

130
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:24,289
MATT: Now, after defeating the hydra, being called
on their law breakage in Vasselheim, have been

131
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:29,256
tasked to return the next morning, as separate
groups, to figure out what contract is being given

132
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:35,880
to them and what members of their team await them
as they arrive. So, you guys have taken the

133
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,228
evening to rest. The next morning has come about.
You find yourselves awakening within your

134
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:46,476
respective tavern rooms, the members of Vox
Machina. What preparation would you like to embark

135
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:50,818
in this morning for whatever mysterious trek
awaits you?

136
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:53,946
TRAVIS: Do they have a weapons closet?

137
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:56,147
LAURA: In the tavern room?

138
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:58,644
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I thought we were in the
guildhall.

139
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,723
MATT: Not yet. You can go there if you want to,
but if there is anything you want to do before

140
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:04,577
arriving at the guildhall, that's up to you.

141
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:06,246
TRAVIS: Scanlan.

142
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:07,331
SAM: Oi!

143
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,919
TRAVIS: Do you want anything from the tavern
before we leave?

144
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,021
SAM: What time is it?

145
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,505
TRAVIS: What time is it?

146
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:15,865
LAURA: What difference does it make? I want to
take a shot with my brother.

147
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:24,733
MATT: All right. So as you and Vax'ildan get
together at the bar, you have the strongest form

148
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:30,968
of nasty Vasselheim liquor that they could
possibly muster. It looks somewhat murky, it has

149
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:37,531
elements of blue and gray to it. The barkeep
assured you that this is-- "This is what you're

150
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,730
"looking for to wake up in the morning, trust me."

151
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,035
LAURA: Does it taste like NyQuil?

152
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:48,770
MATT: As you down the shot, it's-- not knowing
what NyQuil tastes like because there is no such

153
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,366
thing as NyQuil in this world.

154
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:51,300
LAURA: Right.

155
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,634
TALIESIN: Ye olde NyQuil.

156
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:57,420
MATT: The flavor would be reminiscent of licking a
wagon wheel that has seen

157
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,484
at least 100 miles of travel.

158
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:04,924
LAURA: Tastes like your feet smell, brother.

159
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:12,492
MATT: Of which, Vax immediately cringes his face.
"Oh well, that is rather uncouth, dear sister"

160
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:16,064
TALIESIN: And not having Liam here, I'll just--
like that.

161
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:18,118
TRAVIS: Get rid of it. Put it down.

162
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:24,197
MATT: The foot's healed now. The foot is healed.
So you finish your shots,

163
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:26,614
you say adieu to each other and--

164
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,720
LAURA: See you on the other side

165
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,651
MATT: "Indeed, stay safe."

166
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,435
TRAVIS: Bye Vax! (laughs)

167
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:40,439
MATT: "Bye Grog." And he gives you a silent finger
as he leaves the tavern, in true Vax fashion.

168
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:44,251
TRAVIS: He always mixes those fingers up.

169
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,356
MATT: Any preparation on your guys' end?

170
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:50,839
SAM: I'm going to load up my-- whatever this thing
is.

171
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,103
MATT: Your Ioun Stone?

172
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:57,251
SAM: Is that what I have? That's the thing here.
I'm going to load that up with an Invisibility

173
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,015
spell. Is that a thing I could do?

174
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:01,181
MATT: Yeah, you can put up to three spell levels
into that.

175
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,310
SAM: That's two in there, right?

176
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,194
MATT: You may have even been able to do before
you slept the night before, so then you would

177
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:09,798
have all your spells back. So we'll say you did that. 
So you have an extra Invisibility

178
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,470
spell in your Ioun Stone.

179
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,617
SAM: And I can store three spells in there,
right?

180
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:14,923
MATT: Three spell levels.

181
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,129
SAM: Three spell level-- So only one spell at a
time?

182
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,176
MATT: Or you can do three 1st-level spells.

183
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:23,078
SAM: Oh! Then never mind. I thought it was three
different spells. I've already got an extra

184
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:25,380
Lightning Bolt in there. I won't add to it, never
mind.

185
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,037
MATT: Then yeah, that is a full Ioun Stone. That
thing is pulsing with energy and going,

186
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,081
"I'm good."

187
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:32,129
SAM: I'm good, didn't understand.

188
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,694
MATT: Fair enough. Percy.

189
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:38,233
TALIESIN: Other than just tinkering on a few plans
that I have rolling around. I don't really have

190
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:41,770
the equipment to build anything particularly
interesting before we head out.

191
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,795
SAM: Grog might have something in the bag of
holding that you could use.

192
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:51,945
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! I've got lots of shit. We have a
salt lick rock, we've got three firewood bundles,

193
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,545
dried food rations...

194
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,049
SAM: How many fancy cloaks left?

195
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,756
TRAVIS: There's... two.

196
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,632
SAM: Well, that's something.

197
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:02,333
TALIESIN: And we've got that leather from that
weird bat creature from the Underdark.

198
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,649
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't smell bad.

199
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,898
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

200
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:09,480
TALIESIN: Is there any metal canisters in there,
of any kind?

201
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,330
TRAVIS: I mean, I've got my hooded lantern, but
you can't have that. It's dark in places.

202
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,489
TALIESIN: No, I don't want that.

203
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,790
LAURA: I bet Tiberius has metal canisters, he's
got so many canisters.

204
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,935
TRAVIS: Two pieces of armor. Just armor

205
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:28,952
TALIESIN: I may take a piece of armor and see if I
can put together some sort of frag grenade thing.

206
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,078
SAM: A what?

207
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:31,592
TALIESIN: I just want to make a--

208
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:32,834
SAM: Is that a thing?

209
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:33,852
TALIESIN: You don't know me.

210
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,825
(laughter)

211
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:41,436
TALIESIN: Just make a canister, put some black
powder in there, put the thing together. It

212
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:45,507
doesn't even have a fuse, it's something I can
toss and shoot to trigger.

213
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:46,900
TRAVIS: Ooh.

214
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,227
MATT: Interesting. I will say, due to time
constraints, you would probably have to skip a

215
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:56,058
decent breakfast to do this. So, be aware you
may be hungry later on.

216
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,726
LAURA: I've got food.

217
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:58,960
TALIESIN: Done

218
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,841
TRAVIS: We've got dried food rations in the bag.

219
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,428
TALIESIN: I'll have a granola bar.

220
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:05,574
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

221
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,465
TRAVIS: Roll good, you're starting us off. Roll
good.

222
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,053
SAM: I'm going to try to inspire him.

223
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,042
TRAVIS: Roll good.

224
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,478
TALIESIN: You're going to inspire me?

225
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,312
SAM: I'm going to inspire him with a little,
(sings) Boom, clap, the sound of your gun, the

226
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:22,222
beat goes on and on and on and on. Boom, clap--
That's all I got

227
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:31,081
MATT: You can take your d10 bardic inspiration, as
his song blares into your left ear as you search

228
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:35,632
the town for a decent location to possibly
construct this.

229
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:36,801
TALIESIN: 19.

230
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:37,763
MATT: Total of 19?

231
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:38,828
TALIESIN: Total of 19.

232
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:43,291
MATT: All right. Asking around and speaking to a
few folks around Vasselheim, you eventually find a

233
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:49,489
few folks that point you toward this long
abandoned workshop that's been burned down, and it

234
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,832
hasn't really been touched. As you go to it, you
have to push some of the burned wood out of the

235
00:14:53,832 --> 00:15:01,214
way, but there is indeed a currently functional,
if for a long time unused, forge and anvil

236
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:10,810
available. In poor condition, but
functional. Given about two, two and a half hours,

237
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,916
you might be pushing your arrival time at the
guildhall, but you could probably do it. Do you

238
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,220
want to go ahead and give it a shot?

239
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,568
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a shot.

240
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:21,111
MATT: All right. Do you want to use another one of
your bardic inspirations on this?

241
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,290
SAM: Can I do that?

242
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,156
MATT: You can use it up to-- I think it's like
five or six times.

243
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,345
SAM: He's fine.

244
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:27,578
(laughter)

245
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:28,908
TRAVIS: Stingy motherfucker!

246
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,362
SAM: At this point I'm probably drunk.

247
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,698
TALIESIN: I don't get a montage then, never mind.
It's all right, save it for later. We're

248
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,953
going to need it for later.

249
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:43,115
MATT: So it takes you a while to rummage through
the ground to get everything set up. You have the

250
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:47,906
tools from your tinker's kit that you usually keep
with you anyway, and you begin hammering away at

251
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:52,996
the metal, preparing yourself a nice little
spherical container. Using your black powder,

252
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:55,812
which you're starting to get a little low on
black powder between your bullets you've been

253
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,294
constructing and other stuff.

254
00:15:57,294 --> 00:15:58,896
TALIESIN: Got to get home, I know.

255
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:02,457
MATT: So something you can either, some point in
the future try to scavenge up the materials for or

256
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:07,594
make yourself. But just letting you know, you're
starting to run a little low. So go ahead and make

257
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:15,147
a-- I'm going to say make a tinkering check with
your proficiency bonus of four and we will say

258
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:18,951
with your dexterity. Since this is very
meticulous, to make sure this doesn't detonate

259
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,422
during construction.

260
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:25,057
SAM: Wow, you could really use some
inspiration right now.

261
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,998
TALIESIN: No, I don't. That is a 29.

262
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:30,251
SAM: Stingy works.

263
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:31,600
TRAVIS: Like two-nine?

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,489
TALIESIN: Like two-nine. Not two nines, but
two-nine.

265
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:35,509
MATT: What did you roll?

266
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:36,639
TALIESIN: I rolled 19.

267
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,757
MATT: Yeah. That'll do it.

268
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:40,248
(laughter)

269
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:45,352
MATT: All right, so, in spite of the terrible
materials at your disposal-- As far as the forge

270
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:49,950
itself, you barely get it lit, but you can manage
to heat it at enough, at least, to ply a soft

271
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,050
metal. There is an aluminum base type that you
construct as the container, and then coat that

272
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,728
with chunks of very, very hard steel that you
think will work as shrapnel. You manage to

273
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:06,038
complete it. You're not sure how effective it will
be, but at least you know it will travel safe, and

274
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:11,188
that is really more important than anything else
with these type of makeshift explosives.

275
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,156
TALIESIN: I made a holy hand grenade.

276
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,235
(laughter)

277
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,587
TRAVIS: Awesome.

278
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:22,371
MATT: Indeed. All right, as the rest of you gather
up, you've had your breakfast, you rested, you

279
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:28,882
make your way towards the Slayer's Take guildhall.
Approaching the front steps again, the wooden

280
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:34,760
engraving on the front doors, you step into the
main foyer area and are greeted again by Mertin,

281
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,817
the gruff looking halfling, who is in the process of
thumbing through some books. He has some dried

282
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,292
fruit on the side of his chin. He's a little
groggy, like he

283
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,469
didn't sleep well the night before.

284
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,935
TRAVIS: He's a little what?

285
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:46,688
MATT: He's a little groggy.

286
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,773
TRAVIS: Lucky chap.

287
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:56,350
MATT: He looks up as you guys approach. "Very nice
you all could finally make it, it appears you are

288
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,112
"only a grand total of 25 minutes late."

289
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,266
LAURA: 25?!

290
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,699
MATT: "It's not too much of a problem."

291
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:03,849
SAM: What's a minute?

292
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,671
MATT: "It's... All right, there is not too much
going on at the moment. I will not mention this to

293
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:13,110
"the wife. I mean the Huntmaster. Don't mention to
her that I referred to her as my wife."

294
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:19,570
TRAVIS: Kord's strength to you, sir, you've got a
little bit right here.

295
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,322
LAURA: Oh, that's lovely.

296
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:22,668
MATT: "I appreciate the heads up."

297
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,899
TRAVIS: Not a problem, not a problem.

298
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:31,721
MATT: "I hate to lose papaya. So. Let's see, we
have the four of you here. This is the required

299
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:36,339
"necessary group for the first travel this morning,
I am excited to see what the mistress has

300
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:42,634
"available for you. First, and foremost, let me
introduce to you one of your traveling companions

301
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:47,719
"for this. Another hopeful for the Slayer's Take.
Let me retrieve her."

302
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:52,459
And you see Mertin walks off to one of the back
rooms, opens the door and whispers out, "Hey

303
00:18:52,520 --> 00:19:00,316
"quick, your team is here." Opens the door, and
walking out-- if you want to describe yourself.

304
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:02,653
MARY: I walk out in a black cloak.

305
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,446
SAM: This is exciting.

306
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:11,541
MARY: My hair is white, and I have silver eyes,
and a long staff with four dragons and a moonstone

307
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:21,463
planet, as it were, in their midst. I walk out
slowly and I look them all over, one by one.

308
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:32,393
Saying, I don't know you, I don't know you-- as my
tail whips back and forth. I don't know you--

309
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:39,633
almost hitting you with my horns. You, I know. I
saw you at the Crucible, didn't I?

310
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,899
TRAVIS: Maybe.

311
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,246
MARY: Well done against the Hammer.

312
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:51,537
TRAVIS: Thank you, I often get confused with
Phillip the Terrible.

313
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:58,223
MARY: Yes, I'll bet you do. You don't look that
terrible to me, though.

314
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:04,105
TRAVIS: Grog begins to blush, a large blue color
on his cheeks.

315
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:06,300
LAURA: What's your name, woman?

316
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,327
MARY: Zahra.

317
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:07,986
SAM: What?

318
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,931
MARY: Zahra. Zahra Hydris.

319
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:11,565
LAURA: Lovely.

320
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:15,437
MARY: And what's yours?

321
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:16,467
SAM: Me?

322
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,419
MARY: Yes.

323
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,696
SAM: Well, I'm known by different names in
different places.

324
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,881
TRAVIS: Ain't that the truth.

325
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,313
MARY: Really?

326
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,947
SAM: Some call me Kingslayer.

327
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:26,977
(laughter)

328
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:32,943
SAM: Some call me Scanlan. Some just call me when
they want a good time.

329
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,690
(laughter)

330
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,388
TALIESIN: Mostly we just call him Scanlan.

331
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:41,993
MARY: I'll keep the good time in mind. And you?

332
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:45,890
TALIESIN: Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III.

333
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,275
TRAVIS: You can call him Percy.

334
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,273
TALIESIN: They just call me Percy.

335
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,610
MARY: I see you have many weapons on you.

336
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,728
TALIESIN: Yes, I dabble

337
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:52,741
MARY: You dabble a bit?

338
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,737
TALIESIN: I do dabble.

339
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,588
MARY: Yes. Any forging?

340
00:20:55,588 --> 00:21:00,431
TALIESIN: Yes, actually. I just picked it up
recently. I've been working on things. I pull out

341
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,845
the holy hand grenade.

342
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,890
MARY: Ah.

343
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,092
TALIESIN: Getting better.

344
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,779
MARY: I saw one of those in Antioch once

345
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,708
TALIESIN: It's where I've seen them written of.
It's something new.

346
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,847
MARY: We'll have to compare notes sometime.

347
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,301
TALIESIN: Absolutely, charmed.

348
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,255
MARY: I'd love to see your technique.

349
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:24,371
MATT: There is something mildly off-putting by her
intense red skin, her relatively pointed incisors

350
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:31,437
and the very prominent tiefling demonic blood in
her body.

351
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:33,270
TRAVIS: You're a tiefling?!

352
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:41,737
MATT: Nevertheless, there is an elegance to the
way she walks, and there is this look of silent

353
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:45,204
judgment as she continuously passes her eyes over
the rest of the group.

354
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,013
LAURA: Did you want to know my name?

355
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:51,943
MARY: Yes I would. Now I'm not so sure, but
please. Humor me

356
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,649
LAURA: Vex'ahlia. It's a pleasure

357
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,367
MARY: The pleasure is all mine.

358
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,651
LAURA: Yes.

359
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,461
TRAVIS: Oh that's an icy hand grip, isn't it.

360
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,640
LAURA: I love being out here without my brother. I
just love it.

361
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,151
MARY: You have a brother?

362
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:07,300
LAURA: I do.

363
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,221
MARY: Oh. How fascinating.

364
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:14,308
TRAVIS: I am Grog, the unintimidated.

365
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:18,457
MARY: It's nice to know your true name Phillip-- I
mean Grog.

366
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:21,612
TRAVIS: (whispered) I think she knows.

367
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:24,040
TALIESIN: I would like to run a quick perception
test.

368
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,475
MATT: What are you trying to do?

369
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:29,860
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out if she's
titled. She certainly strikes me as titled. I

370
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,895
think she has blood. She may not have blue blood
but--

371
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,156
LAURA: (whispers) She's got blood.

372
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,410
MATT: This would be more of an insight check.

373
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,705
TALIESIN: Insight check, all right.

374
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,829
TRAVIS: (whispers) She's a tiefling!

375
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,183
TALIESIN: Ten.

376
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:51,163
MATT: Best you can tell. From her posture, the way
she walks, there is definitely a, for lack of a

377
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:58,605
better term, a non-arrogant self importance to how
she holds herself. But there is something about it

378
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:04,632
that... there is a mild hint of insecurity there.

379
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:06,484
TALIESIN: Interesting. All right.

380
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,917
TRAVIS: Could I ask you what your weapon of choice
is?

381
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,087
MARY: That would be my staff.

382
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,425
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah.

383
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,384
MARY: It took many years to forge it.

384
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:18,844
LAURA: You made it yourself?

385
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,216
MARY: I did.

386
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:21,826
LAURA: Damn, that's impressive.

387
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:23,102
MARY: Thank you.

388
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,182
MATT: At this point Mertin is looking angrily at a
small pocket watch that he pulls out and looks at.

389
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:32,582
"This is very unusual. Let me see who is supposed
to be leading your group. Hold on just a moment."

390
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:34,325
And he gets up and exits the room briefly.

391
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:35,587
LAURA: Leading?

392
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:40,797
MATT: He comes back after about two minutes with a
small handbook and reads through. "Yes, well, it is

393
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:45,841
"customary that as a part of these trials, there is
a member of the Slayers Take is to accompany you

394
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,278
"on this journey to make sure that you--"

395
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:49,427
SAM: I volunteer to be leader of the group.

396
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,746
MATT: "That is not up for discussion. I am sorry,
small man."

397
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:54,479
(laughter)

398
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,682
SAM: I magically make a cup appear.

399
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:04,306
MATT: He looks slightly impressed, but only
slightly. By the way, being called 'small man' by a

400
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:12,769
halfling is a feat within itself. "All right, so,
the assigned leader to be your guide slayer for

401
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:22,922
"this venture... Oh... really. Well, this should be
curious indeed. She's late, it seems." At which

402
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:29,905
point, the door opens to the guild hall and in
comes stumbling a human female.

403
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:35,773
FELICIA: And I run and I-- Oh my gosh I'm so sorry
I'm late, I'm so sorry-- and then I trip,

404
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:45,239
ridiculously, and I spill cut papaya everywhere.
Oh my gosh, that is disappointing. That is just

405
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:51,110
disappointing. Oh my gosh, you are so
impressive, how lovely. Mertin, I brought you some

406
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,992
papaya. I'm sorry. It's all over the floor right
now. I-- you know what, I will go get a broom, I'll

407
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:56,203
clean it up right now--

408
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,932
MATT: "No, no, don't worry about it, I insist--"

409
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,416
FELICIA: Somebody might slip--

410
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,612
MATT: "Stay. With your group. We have important
business to discuss. I appreciate the papaya."

411
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:05,359
TRAVIS: (under his breath) She's the leader?

412
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,025
FELICIA: Well I just wanted to-- this is my group.
Yay!

413
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:09,648
(desultory yays)

414
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:12,238
FELICIA: So nice to meet all of you. You are
large. You are not. You are so pretty.

415
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:13,365
LAURA: Oh, you are too.

416
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:15,527
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, I've heard about her, she is
something.

417
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,751
LAURA: She is... yeah.

418
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,082
FELICIA: Anyway. Nice to meet you, nice to meet
you.

419
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,158
ALL: Hi.

420
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:20,149
FELICIA: Hi, I'm Lyra.

421
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:21,807
ALL: Lyra? Lyra.

422
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,812
FELICIA: Yes, very nice to meet you all.

423
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:28,755
MATT: And you can see from her-- she is dressed in
a nice blouse, her just-past-shoulder-length,

424
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:35,520
somewhat curly hair, is kept as much as a frazzled
woman would keep. A large pair of glasses adorn

425
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,164
the front of her face, and she definitely is not
who you were expecting to be considered leading

426
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:43,592
this group into its journey.

427
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:44,737
TRAVIS: Nope.

428
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:45,770
MARY: No.

429
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,450
LAURA: What sort of fighter are you, Lyra?

430
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,393
FELICIA: Oh, this is so exciting. This is-- I'm
getting out Mertin, they are letting me out! This

431
00:25:50,393 --> 00:25:51,692
is so exciting.

432
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:55,775
MATT: "This is probably a technicality. I'll have
to make sure this was maybe not--"

433
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:57,018
TALIESIN: Please, yes.

434
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,295
FELICIA: Oh, no, I don't think so.

435
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:04,306
MARY: Do you find yourself sitting behind a wooden
structure most of the day? Something flat like

436
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:06,997
this? Like a desk or a table?

437
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:10,067
FELICIA: Oh my gosh! Do you have psy abilities?

438
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,869
MARY: Just intuition, I guess.

439
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,203
FELICIA: Oh, no. This is so funny. I've seen you
from afar, but I'm very busy in the back room. You

440
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,632
know, I'm very-- I'm invaluable. Right, Mertin?

441
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,266
MATT: "She is. Useful. Yes."

442
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:27,977
FELICIA: Yes. I'm very good at alphabetizing.
Listen, we are going to catch up so much. I'm just

443
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:31,945
really excited. They are letting me out, Mertin!

444
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:34,161
SAM: Have you led a group like this before?

445
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:37,293
FELICIA: No, it's so funny. You wouldn't be able
to tell, right?

446
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,718
TRAVIS and LAURA: Not at all.

447
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:41,240
MARY: You seem very experienced.

448
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,497
TRAVIS: Veteran.

449
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:43,821
LAURA: Very in-charge.

450
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:47,559
FELICIA: Thank you. Thank you. I mean, listen. I
just wanted to welcome everybody. No, no. They

451
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,670
don't actually let me out a lot and I was-- you
know-- when I got the scroll in front ... it was

452
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,575
just-- This is my best robe.

453
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,022
MARY: You've got a little papaya juice on the
front of it

454
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:04,939
FELICIA: Oh no, oh no, oh no! And then I'm like
brushing it and accidentally-- the robe falls off.

455
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:09,457
(gasp) Oh my god! That was inadvertent.

456
00:27:09,457 --> 00:27:16,022
MATT: You hear this awkward smack sound as Mertin
has face-palmed, as unbelievably hard as he can,

457
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:28,726
at the edge of his desk. "I shall retrieve the
Huntmaster." Then he gets up and leaves. You guys

458
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:30,863
are left alone in the foyer for a moment.

459
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:36,094
SAM: So Lyra, you are already a full fledged
slayer?

460
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:37,664
FELICIA: I am, in fact.

461
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,041
SAM: Have you slain?

462
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:42,498
FELICIA: I am a member of the guild. Well, if you
want to be technical--

463
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:44,432
SAM: You seem like someone from The Guild.

464
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:48,739
FELICIA: Yes, I'm a guild member. It's funny
because it's kind of a technicality. I don't know

465
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:50,791
how that happened, but I'm here.

466
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,130
LAURA: What do you normally do? Bookkeeping?
Storage?

467
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,230
FELICIA: Oh, well. It's a really long story. Can I
tell you all about it?

468
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,928
SAM: Abridged. Abridged.

469
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,753
LAURA: Grog look, papaya.

470
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:01,967
TRAVIS: Rah!

471
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,704
FELICIA: I guess some of it's still clean.

472
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:04,939
SAM: He doesn't care.

473
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,654
TRAVIS: It's still good.

474
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:07,953
FELICIA: Yes, so.

475
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,072
LAURA: And Trinket, Trinket too. This is my bear.

476
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:12,364
SAM: Oh, do we get Trinket?

477
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,544
LAURA: Yes, of course we get Trinket!

478
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:14,784
Scanlan Do we get Trinket on the trip?

479
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:18,180
MATT: As you turn, you see that the door after you
pass, and the giant armored bear has made its way

480
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,891
in and pushes past your shoulder abruptly. And
immediately goes nose down and joins Grog, eating

481
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:25,168
papaya off of the ground.

482
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:26,788
TRAVIS: Hey, get your own papaya.

483
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,771
LAURA: This is Trinket.

484
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:29,461
MARY: Fascinating. What kind of bear is he?

485
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:30,256
TALIESIN: A big one.

486
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:31,433
LAURA: A brown one.

487
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:34,977
TRAVIS: We start to wrestle. Gently. That's my
papaya you-- let go!

488
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:40,067
FELICIA: Does anyone have any allergies, if I take
some to-go lunches?

489
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,054
LAURA: Oh, that would be lovely actually.

490
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,286
TRAVIS: Cats.

491
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,997
LAURA: Actually I think Percy is quite hungry.

492
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:48,274
TALIESIN: I actually am quite hungry. I was-- I
don't know if I am quite capable of eating papaya

493
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:54,108
off the floor, but if there is, I don't
know, something brunchy?

494
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:56,974
TRAVIS: I have some dried food rations. Would you
want one of those?

495
00:28:56,974 --> 00:28:58,411
TALIESIN: It will do in a pinch.

496
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,674
FELICIA: Here is a crumbled biscuit.

497
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:02,093
TALIESIN: A crumbled biscuit sounds-- I like her
already, that will do.

498
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,490
TRAVIS: I will remember this slight.

499
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,610
SAM: So have you slain-- have you had any battle
experience at all?

500
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:14,120
FELICIA: Well, it's funny. I'm actually from this
city, but I was in Emon, and I was studying. I'm a

501
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,155
wizard. You know, the wizardly arts.

502
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,627
SAM: Oh, I've heard of them yes.

503
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:18,704
FELICIA: Yes absolutely.

504
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:20,756
SAM: I dabble with them myself.

505
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:26,217
FELICIA: Exactly. My uncle is actually the
diplomat from Emon here, in Vasselheim.

506
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:28,047
SAM: Oh, we are from Emon, as well.

507
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:29,212
FELICIA: That's so funny.

508
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:30,573
LAURA: Perhaps you've heard of us?

509
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:31,788
SAM: Vox Machina?

510
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:33,501
LAURA: Castle Greyskull Keep.

511
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,212
SAM: Castle Greyskull. Some know us as the
S.H.I.Ts.

512
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:37,715
TALIESIN: Kind of a big deal.

513
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:43,838
FELICIA: No. No, but I would love to hear all
about it. I'll put it on a scroll. Anyway, so I

514
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:52,735
came here because my boyfriend, Aldor, is here. He
is going to be my boyfriend. It's a long story.

515
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:55,368
SAM: We've met Aldor.

516
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,209
LAURA: We have?!

517
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,255
SAM: We have.

518
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,990
LAURA: Where did we meet Aldor?

519
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,103
SAM: Yes, we met Aldor.

520
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,258
MATT: He was the leader of the team that found you
guys in the forest.

521
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,196
TRAVIS: That's right!

522
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:05,552
LAURA: (gasps) That guy!

523
00:30:05,552 --> 00:30:10,022
SAM: We tangled with him. Our first run in with
Aldor was not fortuitous.

524
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:12,079
FELICIA: Did he look good? Did he look healthy?

525
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,895
LAURA: I mean, he looked kind of like a dick. If
you want my personal opinion but--

526
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:16,689
SAM: She means he was--

527
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,623
TALIESIN: Strapping!

528
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:19,047
SAM: Strapping, like a dick.

529
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:22,562
FELICIA: Well he is very large, and we won't talk
about that area. I have seen it, but let's not talk

530
00:30:22,562 --> 00:30:28,659
about that either.

531
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,037
TRAVIS: What is your weapon of choice, Lyra?

532
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:38,104
FELICIA: Oh, I have a wand. I have a wand. It's
right here. See? It's not very long.

533
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:39,905
MARY: What's it made of?

534
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:45,370
FELICIA: Oh, it's ash. Which-- it's
lovely. It's very nice. Do you want to know more

535
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,342
about it?

536
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:47,637
MARY: I would love to.

537
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:52,530
MATT: At which point the Huntmaster arrives.
Vanessa Cyndrial steps into the room and looks

538
00:30:52,530 --> 00:31:00,059
about the rest. "Very nice to see that you've all
gathered your teams for the day, and I am also

539
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:05,810
"curious to see your first foray into leading a
group of slayers yourself, Lyra."

540
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,376
FELICIA: Well, I just want to thank you. Thank
you, Vanessa. Thank you for entrusting me with

541
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:18,262
this group. I have been reading up a lot, lately.
I'm very excited to use the commanding presence of

542
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:21,288
a guild leader, and prove my membership of the
guild.

543
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:23,845
LAURA: I would like to thank you very much, as
well.

544
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:24,987
TRAVIS: (muffled) Yeah, me too.

545
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:28,726
LAURA: For putting us in her capable hands.

546
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:36,817
MATT: "This was a... more of a choice of
convenience, and a test universally. As you are a

547
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:44,370
"team of unproven fighters, in the eyes of the
guildhall, and, well. We have a relatively

548
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,758
"unproven member, as well."

549
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,953
FELICIA: Well. I mean, I'm a member.

550
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:55,957
MATT: "Technically, yes. However, I think that her
knowledge and experience would be of very good use

551
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,435
"on such a trek."

552
00:31:57,435 --> 00:32:02,212
MARY: Yes, it should prove to be quite
educational, I would think.

553
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,003
SAM: We'll learn a lot from hearing her talk.

554
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,913
FELICIA: Yay! Thank you.

555
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:09,171
SAM: You're welcome.

556
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:12,802
TALIESIN: You should try the biscuits. They are
slaying me. That's all I know.

557
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:16,712
LAURA: What do you eat? Do you eat-- does it get
stuck in your teeth a lot?

558
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:25,216
MARY: Well, it does sometimes, but you grab a twig
and just work it out after a while. Gives you a

559
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,008
little something later to chew on.

560
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:29,189
TRAVIS: Twigs work great. Don't they? I like
twigs.

561
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:32,351
SAM: Don't we have some guilds to prove membership
to?

562
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,966
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we kill something now please,
before we learn anything else.

563
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:40,769
MATT: She snaps her fingers loudly, and Mertin
comes rushing from around the corner carrying

564
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:46,657
something in his arms. "As you are on this journey
for us, and for the guild, and your own personal

565
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:52,410
"name and title within our establishment, we would
like to provide you with a semblance of

566
00:32:52,470 --> 00:33:01,401
"protection, or at least a useful little package. A
gift, from us to you." She puts her hand on the

567
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:07,326
table and Mertin comes over and hands you what
looks like a small leather chest. It's made of

568
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:10,997
sculpted leather. Rolls back, and pushes it
forward. You can hear the clinking of glass as he

569
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:16,326
does so, and on the inside you can see there are
four glass vials, prepared with some sort of a

570
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:22,442
swirling red, silver-ish liquid inside. You
recognize these as healing-based potions.

571
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,436
SAM: Like Moderate Healing?

572
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,848
LAURA: Superior? Perhaps.

573
00:33:26,848 --> 00:33:32,116
MATT: These would constitute as Greater Healing
Potions, and there are four in total. You can

574
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:33,768
distribute as you see fit.

575
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:35,654
SAM: I think the members of Vox Machina should get
them.

576
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:39,328
LAURA: That doesn't seem really--

577
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,415
MARY: Is that what you think?

578
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:44,301
SAM: Well, just because I-- I defer to--

579
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:49,981
FELICIA: As the leader, I enjoy being hospitable,
and I agree with this small person.

580
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:53,062
MARY: Well Scanlan, if you feel you need it.

581
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:56,214
TALIESIN: I already have a couple, so I will
gladly give one to somebody

582
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:57,120
who is going to need it.

583
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,704
LAURA: I've got plenty. Take it. If you need it.

584
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,436
MARY: I have plenty myself. Thank you very much.

585
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,867
SAM: I will. More for me.

586
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:10,487
MATT: "Very well. Now that we have this situated.
Has everyone gathered the provisions they require

587
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,694
"for this journey? Are you ready to embark?"

588
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:15,295
TRAVIS: I mean, we don't have a body bag for some
of these chumps.

589
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,178
SAM: Did you eat enough, Percy?

590
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:19,078
TALIESIN: The biscuit was very filling. It was
extremely filling.

591
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:25,435
FELICIA: You're very welcome. I can get some more.
Can I just go to the kitchen and grab some-- no?

592
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:34,344
MATT: "Anyway. This is a secondary gift.
Temporarily lent out for your contracts." Mertin

593
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:39,880
brings up what looks like another satchel. It has
a series of metal snaps across the top. These

594
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,326
little buttons that snap together and enclose it
entirely. It's an over-the-shoulder-type throw. As

595
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:52,000
he opens it and you look inside, it resembles the bag
of holding, but it's not quite a bag of holding.

596
00:34:52,144 --> 00:35:00,555
"This is used for the transportation of, how do
you say, perishable aspects of your quarry. Things

597
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:06,346
"that you would harvest from the creature you have
been assigned tend to, depending on the creature,

598
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:13,849
"rot away within a very short period of time. When
placed within this, they should be sustained for a

599
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:19,463
"few weeks at the very least. So, please do be very
mindful and careful of this. Should it be lost,

600
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:24,500
"there is a very small chance you will be able to
fulfill your contract. So, who shall be taking

601
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,198
"this on the journey?"

602
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:28,591
SAM: You've already go the bag of holding.

603
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:29,838
LAURA: I'll hold onto it.

604
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:30,882
MARY: I shall.

605
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:31,844
TALIESIN: You're kind of stealthy aren't you?

606
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:32,669
MARY: I shall take it.

607
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:33,642
LAURA: I shall take it.

608
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,486
MARY: I shall take it.

609
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:35,299
LAURA: I will--

610
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,214
TRAVIS: Roll for it.

611
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:38,340
SAM: Why don't we roll for-- Why don't we flip a
coin for it?

612
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,225
MARY: Do you know Roshambo?

613
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,546
SAM: That would be great.

614
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,573
LAURA: Ha!

615
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:47,060
MARY: Congratulations, I'm so happy for you.

616
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,201
SAM: Oh, wait. Should we ask the leader of the
group, here?

617
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,339
MARY: I'm so sorry.

618
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:51,311
LAURA: Sorry Lyra.

619
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:53,618
FELICIA: Oh that's quite all right. Thank you for
actually including me.

620
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,690
LAURA: Of course.

621
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,768
FELICIA: As the leader of this party, I will agree
with the roshambo.

622
00:35:57,768 --> 00:36:00,736
SAM: (chuckles) So it is decreed.

623
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:07,227
MARY: Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for my tail to
hit you in your rear end so sharply. Sometimes it

624
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,499
has a mind of its own.

625
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,894
LAURA: It's like a whip.

626
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,378
MARY: I know.

627
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:15,935
MATT: At which point Vanessa is just watching with
a grin on her face. "It is good to see you have

628
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:21,671
"already established a pecking order within your
traveling companions. This bodes well for your

629
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:26,810
"journey, most certainly. To you." And she hands
you the satchel.

630
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,318
LAURA: (gasps) But I won. I won. Give it to me.
What? Please.

631
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:33,615
MARY: I'm sorry, I don't think it was given to
you.

632
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:38,841
LAURA: I already have it. I already have it on my
shoulder. It's too late. I'm writing it down.

633
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:43,529
MARY: I certainly hope you don't lose it during
our quest.

634
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:47,615
TRAVIS: Vanessa, I have a question. What happens
if we don't come back

635
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:50,274
with all of the members we left with?

636
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,370
MATT: "Well, then I suppose they would not be
allowed into the guildhall."

637
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,449
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

638
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:58,719
MATT: "Mostly for no longer returning to the city
of Vasselheim, but that is not our problem. There

639
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,556
"is danger in this which I should get to,
actually."

640
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,156
SAM: Yes, please tell us. Where are we going?

641
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:08,067
MATT: "You have now received your gifts and your
various required implements for this journey. A

642
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:14,460
"contract has just recently come to us from the
Crown of Erathis, within this portion of the city.

643

"It has been approved for slaying. This will prove
quite a challenge. Based on how highly you spoke

644
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:30,383
"of your abilities, I will warn you. The quarry is
quite dangerous. Should you find yourself in

645
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:41,728
"trouble, I wish to remind you that it is better to
live and fail, than to be foolish and die. Let me

646
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:46,782
"pass on to you the contract that has been
selected for you." Then she reaches out and hands

647
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:55,175
this over to you, Percy.

648
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:58,614
SAM: Should Lyra?

649
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:03,871
FELICIA: Oh no, let me try. Oh no! Maybe you
should read it.

650
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,487
MARY: I cast Mending on it.

651
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:09,857
SAM: You can do that? So sexy.

652
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:15,594
MATT: As she flicks her wrist a small spark of
purple-ish dark energy shoots from her finger,

653
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:19,858
slams into the side of the contract, and the tear
in the contract repairs itself immediately.

654
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:21,961
FELICIA: Oh wow.

655
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:24,972
TALIESIN: Scotch tape would do it too.

656
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:29,252
MARY: The Scots have nothing to do with it.

657
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:32,726
TALIESIN: "Ordered and paid in advance by the
alchemist Oswind Grund, the client... This

be refunded to the client. This client--"

662
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,380
MARY: I'm sorry, could you go over, again, what we
are harvesting, please?

663
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,946
TALIESIN: Ah, we haven't gotten to that yet.

664
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:56,847
MARY: Sorry.

665
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:59,345
TALIESIN: Oh, it's all right. "This contract is
good for three days, and should the contract not

"willful forgiveness."

SAM: This is the fine print, get to the details.

670
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,080
TALIESIN: "Quarry has been approved for hunting by
the Holy Paramounts of the Crown of Erathis. The

671
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,524
quarry: one adult white dragon--" One adult white
dragon?!

672
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:23,840
LAURA: A white dragon? Would I know? I would know,
because I've studied them.

673
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:31,654
MATT: Yes, having dragons being a very favored
enemy for you. White dragons are one of the

674
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:39,860
chromatic dragon circle. They are considered
largely very spiteful, arrogant, a little more

675
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,676
bestial, and very, very dangerous foes.

676
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:44,523
MARY: Yes, they are glorious.

677
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:46,514
LAURA: Didn't we kill a white dragon?

678
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,842
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

679
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,030
SAM: Platinum dragon?

680
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,939
LAURA: No, I thought the ice dragon thing-- wasn't
she white?

681
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:56,238
MATT: Once upon a time, you battled, back at
Westruun.

682
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:58,379
SAM: I don't see race so I don't know.

683
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,705
FELICIA: What kind of element is a white dragon?

684
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,592
MATT: Ice and frost.

685
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:05,513
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

686
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:08,581
LAURA: Yeah, the woman and then she turned into a
dragon.

687
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:10,761
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ashley killed her. I mean, Pike.

688
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:15,448
MATT: "This bodes well. If you have already
defeated such a creature, then this should be a

"very simple task."

690
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:18,241
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

691
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,525
FELICIA: This is going to be easy.

692
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:20,883
TRAVIS: What do we have to bring back?

693
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:23,068
TALIESIN: They want eyes, tongue, heart, claws,
and teeth.

694
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:25,124
LAURA: So anything else we get to keep ourselves?

695
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:30,675
TALIESIN: Two eyes, one tongue, one heart, six
claws, and 20 teeth, is what they are requesting.

696
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,325
SAM: And do we get paid for such items?

697
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:39,456
TALIESIN: Yes. There are individual prices for
each individual object. Eyes, 900 gold each.

698
00:40:39,456 --> 00:40:47,569
Tongue is 1,200 gold. The heart is 3,500. Claws,
250 gold each, and teeth are 50 gold each.

699
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:50,774
FELICIA: If there are any remaining organs, we can
roshambo for it.

700
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:53,508
MATT: "Very good."

701
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:55,547
LAURA: And scales, definitely. There will be
plenty of scales.

702
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,678
TALIESIN: Plenty of scales.

703
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:58,885
MARY: Yes, there will be plenty of scales. Very
good for armor and--

704
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:00,671
TALIESIN: Very good for armor.

705
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,909
TRAVIS: Does it say where this dragon lives?

706
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,384
TALIESIN: No.

707
00:41:04,384 --> 00:41:12,981
MATT: "Ah, see. That is part of the job. To find
one's quarry is why we are so specialized, in the

708
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:20,784
"Slayer's Take. You may now embark. Once we signify
the pact of the contract." And as she reaches out

709
00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:25,422
and touches the edge of it, you can see there are
these arcane sigils that are on the contract

710
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:31,455
itself. They glow and pulse briefly and she just
walks across the group. First, to you Percy, as

711
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:36,925
you were holding it. "Place your hand against the
contract." As you do they light up, and you feel a

712
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:42,006
surge of warm energy go through your torso. At
which point, you now see, at the bottom of the

713
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:49,466
contract, your name inscribe itself, magically,
into the contract. She then takes it and passes it

714
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:54,728
to each one of you to the same point. As the spell
binds--

715
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:58,044
LAURA: What about Trinket? Does he use his paw?

716
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:03,506
MATT: "I suppose he is part of your band." And she
reaches out the paper.

717
00:42:03,506 --> 00:42:05,350
LAURA: Trinket. Shake.

718
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:10,715
MATT: Slams it out of her hand, knocking the
contract onto the ground, and there is a brief

719
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:16,950
moment where she pulls the paw back and the paper
is wrecked a little bit, but there is indeed a paw

720
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:23,810
that inscribes itself on the bottom of the
contract for Trinket's insignia. "Now, I have a

721
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:29,992
"busy day to attend. I wish you the utmost of
safety, good luck, and safe travels."

722
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,578
SAM: Thank you, I guess.

723
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:38,547
FELICIA: Bye! I'll alphabetize the rest of those
ingredients when I get back. Don't worry. It's

724
00:42:38,547 --> 00:42:39,609
going to be fine.

725
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:41,537
MATT: "I'd appreciate that, good luck."

726
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:43,976
FELICIA: Okay, great. Bye-bye. Thanks again for
giving me a chance.

727
00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:45,490
MATT: "That's great. Please, go."

728
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,346
FELICIA: Okay.

729
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:47,773
SAM: Are you the housekeeper here?

730
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:52,667
FELICIA: No, no. Listen. No, I am a guild member.
On a technicality, but I am a guild member.

731
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,822
MARY: Tell me again, what have you slain?

732
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,552
FELICIA: Well, well, it's--

733
00:42:56,552 --> 00:43:02,029
MARY: No, very abbreviated, just a short-- can you
say the word of what it is.

734
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:04,056
LAURA: Just the biggest one.

735
00:43:04,056 --> 00:43:09,563
FELICIA: It was a worg. Who almost absconded with
my boyfriend, Aldor.

736
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,617
And at the last minute I interceded.

737
00:43:11,617 --> 00:43:13,916
LAURA: You killed someone who was sleeping with
your boyfriend?

738
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,969
FELICIA: No, no. It was worg. A worg!

739
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:16,906
LAURA: Okay.

740
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:18,732
SAM: Is that a thing?

741
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:19,796
FELICIA: It's a thing

742
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:21,209
SAM: We haven't encountered one of those, I don't
think.

743
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:22,805
LAURA: It's a person that changes into animals, am
I right?

744
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:26,511
MARY: No, it's something that-- it projects itself
into animals?

745
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:29,971
MATT: In certain book series, yes.

746
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:34,097
(laughter)

747
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:39,378
MARY: I'm a very prolific reader. And I've never
read of worgs other than in that circumstance.

748
00:43:39,378 --> 00:43:42,170
SAM: In Twilight, that's true.

749
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,048
MARY: That could have been the fairy tale section
of the library.

750
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:47,144
TRAVIS: It also sparkles. Sparkles in the
sunlight.

751
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:48,566
MARY: But only in the sun.

752
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:54,806
MATT: Worgs in this world are essentially a side
breed of large bulbous, wolf-like entities.

753
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,117
ALL: Oh!

754
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:57,926
MARY: A bulbous dire wolf.

755
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,235
LAURA: Oh you killed a wolf?

756
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,523
MARY: A bloated wolf, basically?

757
00:44:00,523 --> 00:44:01,716
FELICIA: It's a large wolf.

758
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:03,087
MATT: It's not quite dire wolf sized.

759
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,270
LAURA: No, yeah, that's great.

760
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,532
MARY: A gaseous wolf?

761
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,681
MATT: For instance-- out of character here,
outside of the world. In Lord of the Rings, the

762
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:10,135
things that the orcs ride.

763
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:11,481
ALL: Oh!

764
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,827
LAURA: Oh, they're really scary.

765
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:18,734
FELICIA: It was quite a situation. It was either
the worg or Aldor, and I would do anything to save

766
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:21,298
Aldor. What did he look like, when you saw him?

767
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:22,868
TRAVIS: Oh god, here we go again.

768
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,124
SAM: He was a little dirty.

769
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,058
LAURA: I mean, he looked actually kind of
frightened.

770
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:30,482
FELICIA: Was he wearing armor? Like, a
red-ish sort of very fantastic armor?

771
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,063
SAM: It was hard to focus on his armor with all of
his screaming and panting.

772
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:35,655
LAURA: And whimpering, really.

773
00:44:35,655 --> 00:44:37,303
FELICIA: He is very brave. He must have been
injured.

774
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,373
LAURA: No, yes, he seems like he would have been
had he hadn't--

775
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,616
SAM: We tease because we love. He did fine. He
fought well. He fought bravely,

776
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:42,800
and he treated us fairly.

777
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,979
LAURA: Especially when he got burned by Tiberius.

778
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:47,927
FELICIA: You burned my.... kind-of-boyfriend?!

779
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:49,545
SAM: Not the face. Not the face.

780
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:50,813
LAURA: His face is fine.

781
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,902
SAM: I didn't do it.

782
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,930
FELICIA: We need to talk about this more on the
road, but we should get going.

783
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,208
SAM: Let's certainly start talking.

784
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,451
MARY: Yes, let's do.

785
00:44:56,451 --> 00:45:00,040
MATT: As you all leave, the Huntmaster expectantly
waiting for you to exit the guildhall, you find

786
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,853
yourself out amongst the streets of Vasselheim.
With no particular direction in where to find the

787
00:45:06,853 --> 00:45:08,411
white dragon in three days.

788
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:09,523
LAURA: Three days?

789
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:10,908
MATT: Three days to slay it, yes.

790
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:14,053
SAM: Hey, Vex. Can any of us sense a dragon within
six miles of here?

791
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:15,628
LAURA: That's what I'm doing. I'm checking that
out.

792
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:17,660
FELICIA: Oh, yes. I can cast Locate Creature too.

793
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,927
LAURA: Oh, that works too.

794
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:20,359
FELICIA: Yeah, let's do it. Together.

795
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:23,359
SAM: Do we need some sort of-- anything for you to
cast the spell?

796
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,787
FELICIA: Oh no, I have all of my ingredients.

797
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:27,406
SAM: No, but do you need to know something of what
you are trying to locate?

798
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,743
Or does it work on name alone?

799
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:35,107
MATT: As per the Locate Creature spell, it can
only locate creatures within 1,000 feet of the

800
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,958
ritual that is completed. But it locates them with
pinpoint accuracy.

801
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:43,417
LAURA: Oh, that's great. Well then we can use it
in conjunction. Because I can use Primeval

802
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,743
Awareness and find any dragons within six miles.

803
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,954
FELICIA: Oh you are very skilled.

804
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:50,069
TRAVIS: Can I try to grow my beard, real quick?

805
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:51,316
MARY: You can grow a beard?

806
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,337
MATT: Yes.

807
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:53,312
SAM: Sometimes.

808
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:54,182
TALIESIN: Not really.

809
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:55,216
TRAVIS: 33.

810
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:56,469
SAM: That's better, that's better.

811
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:59,202
MATT: At this point, and you guys noticed it and
didn't make a mention, because for some of you

812
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:04,820
this was just a very dire morning. But since Grog
woke up this morning he had a very, very nice coat

813
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:09,458
of somewhat bristly, translucent-- not very
attractive facial hair,

814
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,294
but facial hair by definition.

815
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:15,080
LAURA: It's like fishing line coming out of his
face.

816
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,466
TRAVIS: I'm a damn pirate now. Watch out.

817
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:21,187
TALIESIN: Like a 14 year old whose father doesn't
love him enough to

818
00:46:21,187 --> 00:46:22,815
teach him how to groom himself.

819
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:26,127
TRAVIS: (laughs) Jesus... Oh. Wow.

820
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:27,893
SAM: That's dark.

821
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,857
TRAVIS: There's a story there.

822
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:33,263
LAURA: Percy's seen some shit.

823
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:35,179
MARY: Yeah!

824
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:37,965
TALIESIN: There's no parental issues over here.
None.

825
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,845
LAURA: So, can I do that then?

826
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:45,980
MATT: You can. You, along with Trinket by your
side, you find a small space--

827
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,106
LAURA: I can't find his exact location, but I
can...

828
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:49,597
MATT: You can gather the general--

829
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:51,386
MARY: How far away are we, from the wood, at this
point?

830
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:54,917
MATT: You are still in the city of Vasselheim. You
are in the Quadroads district, which is the most

831
00:46:54,917 --> 00:47:01,641
central portion of the city-- it's the Erathis
driven area. You are about a 15 minute walk from

832
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:04,417
the nearest walls that exit out into the Vesper
Timberlands.

833
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:05,458
TRAVIS: 15.

834
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,275
FELICIA: Do I know anything about where the dragon
might be?

835
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:13,320
MATT: You have no idea. This would be one of those
occasions where your best bet would be research or

836
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:14,790
asking around.

837
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,540
TRAVIS: Dragon! Drag--!

838
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,632
SAM: No, don't do that.

839
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:20,328
LAURA: So can I--?

840
00:47:20,328 --> 00:47:23,861
MATT: So, you take a moment, you ground yourself,
and you place your hands on the dirt and take in

841
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:30,013
the general feel of all natural creatures and 
unnatural beasts that you are attuned to in the

842
00:47:30,062 --> 00:47:36,136
vicinity. You focus on the essence of what is
dragon and dragonkin, dragon kind. And

843
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:41,971
find that within the six mile radius, there is
nothing that catches your attention.

844
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:43,113
LAURA: Shit.

845
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:47,296
SAM: All right. Lyra. Lira? Lyra.

846
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:50,085
FELICIA: Lyra. Thank you for asking because some
people just don't care.

847
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:56,214
SAM: Yes, well I want to get it right. Who--
you've been living here for quite some time, I

848
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:57,542
imagine, as a guild member.

849
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,209
FELICIA: Well, I grew up here, with my uncle--
Uncle Randy. Do you want to meet him?

850
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:06,585
SAM: No. Unless he is knowledgeable about dragons.
I was going to ask you where should we go to ask

851
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:11,357
who might know things about the woods, about the
wilds, about where dragons might keep?

852
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:14,952
FELICIA: That's a very good question. I would say
Aldor, but he will not talk to me.

853
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:18,592
SAM: That's unfortunate.

854
00:48:18,592 --> 00:48:22,918
FELICIA: It is, really. Do you want to talk about
it, because I could use some advice.

855
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:27,770
SAM: We can have some girl talk later, but right
now, focus on the dragon.

856
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,123
LAURA: Zahra, what about you, do you know about
dragons?

857
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:32,855
MARY: I don't know where the dragons are, but--
I'm so sorry. I do not mean to interrupt-- but I

858
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:41,899
can use Beast Speech, so if we come close to
anything, I could ask, potentially, to understand.

859
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,717
Maybe get an idea, or--

860
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:47,633
FELICIA: There may be somebody at the Abundant
Terrace who might know something about the woods

861
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,799
and direction. That might be a good place to
start. It's a section of town where they

862
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:57,382
concentrate on-- yes. So we can go there.

863
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:59,500
LAURA: All right, let's do that.

864
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,064
TRAVIS: Let's go there. Please, god.

865
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:08,643
MATT: All right, so in following Lyra towards the
Abundant Terrace, which is on the western side of

866
00:49:08,643 --> 00:49:13,238
town. This area is very different in visual style.
As soon as you approach this small hill that leads

867
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:19,440
into the terrace proper, it is almost entirely
farmland. In this strange, harsh environment there

868
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,802
is something about this entire district that is
structured to be the source of vegetation and

869
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:29,673
crops, and to be essentially feeding a large
portion of the population here. You also see there

870
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:37,913
are a series of small temple towers and statues
that are focused around a particular deity. I

871
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:41,522
want you guys to go ahead and 
roll religion real fast.

872
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:44,845
LAURA: Roll a d20, and add your religion.

873
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:48,816
MARY: Starting off well.

874
00:49:48,816 --> 00:49:52,511
LAURA: Great first roll.

875
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,029
FELICIA: That roll is not good.

876
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:56,208
SAM: 23.

877
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,364
TALIESIN: 22.

878
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:01,259
MATT: Which, you know this information. But before
you can even say it, as you are eager to mention,

879
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:07,296
you sense that there is worship of Melora here.
Melora which is considered the goddess of

880
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:14,006
wilderness and the sea and is one of the five--
soon to be six if Pike's temple raises-- deities

881
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:21,453
that essentially rule the belief system and
lifestyle of the city of Vasselheim. So through

882
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:27,673
the blessing and touch of Melora in this district
they are able to treat the land as magically

883
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:35,802
fertile territory to grow. You gather upon
stepping inside that there's a cluster of dirty

884
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,299
looking, but very, very cluttered and busy
taverns, inns and general stores, like the entire

885
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:51,568
portion of the district that isn't farmland is
jammed into this one little corner. Go ahead and

886
00:50:51,705 --> 00:50:56,713
make an investigation check.

887
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:59,225
TRAVIS: Six.

888
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:00,225
FELICIA: 21.

889
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,276
SAM: 22.

890
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:02,525
LAURA: 20.

891
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:04,977
MATT: Percy?

892
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:05,989
TALIESIN: 17.

893
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:07,657
MARY: 17.

894
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:13,279
MATT: 17, all right. You guys split up a bit
briefly to try and find more information. One of

895
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:19,936
the groups that coalesces is Vex, Scanlan, and
Lyra. The three of you come upon a place called

896
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:25,006
The Midnight Breath Tavern. You step inside and
speak for a bit and eventually you meet the

897
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:34,649
co-owner, a gentleman named Dagon, who is an older
human who has what looks like a reddish, but

898
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:39,519
somewhat patchy red and brown beard, a couple
scars on his body, but nothing battle worn-- more

899
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,486
just a person who has existed in this harsh
landscape for a while. You guys are asking around

900
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:48,560
and talking about dragons, mentioning dragons, and
somebody points in his direction and says, "Ah,

901
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,820
"dragon. You're gonna want to talk to Dagon about
that. He's the one who sees dragons."

902
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:55,131
LAURA: Sees them?

903
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,703
SAM: Let's go.

904
00:51:56,703 --> 00:51:58,246
FELICIA: That's nice.

905
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,716
TRAVIS: I walk over to Dagon--

906
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,123
SAM: You're not with us, are you?

907
00:52:01,123 --> 00:52:01,956
MARY: No.

908
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:02,830
TRAVIS: What?

909
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,816
LAURA: You're not with us.

910
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,396
TALIESIN: You're with me. We're still wandering
about like idiots.

911
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:06,658
MATT: You guys are wandering about.

912
00:52:06,658 --> 00:52:07,658
MARY: Are we outside?

913
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,288
MATT: You guys are in the process of asking
around. You'll meet up

914
00:52:09,288 --> 00:52:10,773
with them in just a moment.

915
00:52:10,773 --> 00:52:13,650
FELICIA: Vex, you're very attractive. Use your
wiles.

916
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,092
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

917
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:18,226
SAM: Her wiles kill.

918
00:52:18,226 --> 00:52:21,402
LAURA: Dagon, is that your name?

919
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:26,970
MATT: "That's my name." He's cleaning a glass.

920
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,161
LAURA: I've heard many things about your knowledge
of dragons.

921
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:32,463
MATT: "Correct."

922
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:33,664
LAURA: Yes.

923
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,249
MATT: "Y--You've seen it? You've seen the
dragon?"

924
00:52:35,249 --> 00:52:37,356
LAURA: I have seen dragons, and they suck.

925
00:52:37,356 --> 00:52:41,008
MATT: You hear a couple of snickers down the bar
and he goes, "Shut the hell up!"

926
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:43,460
LAURA: Unless you like them. Do you like them?

927
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:50,413
MATT: "No, no one around here likes a dragon
proper. At least, none that I've come across. No,

928
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:57,875
"I swears it. I swears it. I saw this one. I was up
north, about two days' travel northwest of here via

929
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,652
"the Glasswalk Road. That's two days' travel
horseback, mind you."

930
00:53:00,652 --> 00:53:02,083
LAURA: The Glasswalk...? The Glasswalk... Road?

931
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,206
MATT: "The Glasswalk Road, yeah."

932
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:04,211
LAURA: Yes, of course.

933
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:08,002
MATT: "I was heading to Muldire to, you know, visit
my brother and some of my family lives up in that

934
00:53:08,002 --> 00:53:15,221
"northern area. It's freezing cold, too chilly for
my tastes but-- I was going to visit and no more

935
00:53:15,221 --> 00:53:21,014
"than two days up there, a nasty blizzard blows in
out of nowhere, just starts wrecking the entire

936
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:24,554
"roadside, slick with ice. We decide to go ahead
and make camp, me and a couple of the others who

937
00:53:24,554 --> 00:53:29,969
"were journeying with me. We head off the road, set
up a small camp, throw up some tents, and

938
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:34,718
"thankfully, at least within the canopy of the
forest, it's easy enough to escape the barrage of

939
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:40,196
"the elements, but it was a very, very cold night.
Our fire began to go out,

940
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:41,769
"and we were a little worried."

941
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:43,153
LAURA: And then there was a dragon?

942
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,569
SAM: Yeah, get to the dragon. I'm sorry.

943
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:46,209
MATT: "Hold on, let me tell my story."

944
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:47,478
FELICIA: That was very rude. I am so sorry.

945
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:48,828
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

946
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:52,191
MATT: "It's all right, I'm used to it." And a
voice over there says, "Yeah, he is!"

947
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:54,386
"You. I will kick you out. I will kick you--"

948
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:57,548
LAURA: I believe that you saw a dragon and I
believe that it was white because you were in a

949
00:53:57,548 --> 00:53:59,395
blizzard. Right? Am I right?

950
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:04,260
MATT: "I'll get to that. Patience. Now, we're
sitting there--" And you get the feeling around

951
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:09,263
you that, there's like eight other people in
this tavern who are all face in their hands, like

952
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:12,934
this story has probably been told dozens of times.
Over and over again.

953
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:19,369
"So partway into the night, we're trying to keep
warm when suddenly we hear this terrifying roar,

954
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:25,316
"that streaks across the sky. We could hear it over
the blistering sound of the snow and sleet

955
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:31,314
"battered against our tent. I rush outside to take
a look. Not sure what to find, but instead, I see

956
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:36,521
"what looks like a pack of four dire wolves
converging on our camp. Large, nasty beasts--"

957
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:38,682
LAURA: Very much like a worg, if you will.

958
00:54:38,682 --> 00:54:40,359
MATT: "Worg-like, a little larger, yes."

959
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:44,718
FELICIA: How large? Do you want to tell-- How
large proportionally would you say the...? No?

960
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:46,211
Okay, keep going.

961
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:48,880
MATT: "Well, no. I mean, if you want to get into--
if you're talking worg versus dire wolf, worg is

962
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,072
"still pretty large. About a good three, four--"

963
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:54,405
FELICIA: I know, I've seen one. You know what
happened with me? I got into the guild because...

964
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,854
TRAVIS: Oh god, here we go.

965
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:57,812
LAURA: Well. Actually. Dragon.

966
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:05,816
MATT: "So, this pack of dire wolves are converging
on me. I myself am fearful, but I know that, if

967
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:09,730
"I'm gonna make a stand, now is the time to do it.
So I reach over and draw my dagger, and prepare

968
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,051
"myself to defend--"

969
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:14,116
LAURA: That's a giant dagger, if I've ever seen
one.

970
00:55:14,116 --> 00:55:23,504
MATT: "Thank you." He re-sheathes it, a little
blush to his cheeks. "I prepared myself to accept

971
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:28,935
"possible defeat at these terrifying beasts. Then a
secondary roar breaks out. This time not from

972
00:55:28,935 --> 00:55:38,341
"around, but above. Incoming, streaking out of the
clouds above, I see, believe me, a dragon.

973
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:41,072
"Wing-span huge, claws and teeth gnashing--"

974
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:44,840
LAURA: I would never have guessed that's where
that was going. White dragon?

975
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,544
MATT: "White as the snow that encased the skyline.
It streaks down and snatch! Takes one of the worgs

976
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:56,904
"in its jaws. Lifts up the worg, screeching about
angrily. It throws it into the air, and from its

977
00:55:56,904 --> 00:56:02,363
"mouth cascades a blistering, freezing cascade of
ice and sleet.

978
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:05,553
"The worg itself freezes in mid-air."

979
00:56:05,553 --> 00:56:06,638
LAURA: Whoa.

980
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:10,907
MATT: "Before it can plummet, the creature then
closes its jaws, snatching down on that worg, and

981
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:16,579
"biting it in two. Only one fell stroke. As the
pieces of ice clatter to the ground, the rest of

982
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:20,163
"the worgs scatter. I believe that dragon saved our
lives that night."

983
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:26,568
LAURA: That's great. How did you make it back,
without dying?

984
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:31,687
MATT: "Well apparently the dragon had its fill and
the dire wolves went off. So we packed up and went

985
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:33,616
"right on back. Never made it to Muldire."

986
00:56:33,616 --> 00:56:41,542
LAURA: Did the dragon keep flying in the direction
of the Glasswalk Road? Or did it go east or west?

987
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:42,913
Or which way?

988
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:46,354
MATT: "I have no idea, actually. We just ran. We
turned tail and got the hell out of there as fast

989
00:56:46,354 --> 00:56:47,447
"as we could."

990
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,668
SAM: That was quite a story, quite a story.

991
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:50,857
FELICIA: That was stirring.

992
00:56:50,857 --> 00:56:52,269
MATT: "You believe me? You believe me on this?!"

993
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:53,445
LAURA: We believe you.

994
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:57,481
SAM: Not only do we believe you, but we want to tell
others of this. In fact, I'm a bit of a performer.

995
00:56:57,529 --> 00:56:59,635
I may write a song about your exploits.

996
00:56:59,635 --> 00:57:00,621
MATT: "Could you?"

997
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:04,813
LAURA: Actually, could I roll for perception or
insight to see if he's

998
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:06,354
telling the truth on everything?

999
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:08,734
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

1000
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:12,870
SAM: Roll! Two.

1001
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:16,246
LAURA: Oh yeah, two. No, 17.

1002
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:17,478
MATT: 17.

1003
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:19,828
LAURA: No, is that a 17 or an 11?

1004
00:57:19,828 --> 00:57:20,686
TRAVIS: 11.

1005
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:21,602
MARY: That's 11.

1006
00:57:21,602 --> 00:57:22,478
LAURA: 17.

1007
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:29,475
MATT: 17. All right. He's not the most complicated
man. So, reading his intent is easier than a lot

1008
00:57:29,475 --> 00:57:35,080
of individuals you've had to keep an eye on
previously. He is eager to tell the story and is

1009
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:42,080
in full belief. The frustration, and the only
things that detract from his child-like excitement

1010
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,989
at telling this tale, is his moments of side
looking frustration to the other members of the

1011
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:52,862
tavern that do not take him seriously, it seems.
Dagon does seem to be truthful in, at least,

1012
00:57:52,862 --> 00:57:54,670
believing what he is saying to you.

1013
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,313
FELICIA: Thank you so much for your information-- I
take a gold coin and I'm just like, is this

1014
00:57:58,313 --> 00:58:02,363
enough? Yes, that's good. Thank you. So we-- we'll
be going. Yeah?

1015
00:58:02,427 --> 00:58:07,143
LAURA: Can I perception and see how heavy that bag
of gold actually looks? I just want to know.

1016
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:09,246
MATT: Make a perception check.

1017
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:15,620
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to roll the gold dice. 24.

1018
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:27,471
MATT: 24. As she reaches into the pouch-- there is
a rather large, visibly bulging pouch to her side

1019
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:31,252
that is, in no way shape or form, even attempting
to be covertly hidden.

1020
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:34,772
SAM: She's got a Scrooge McDuck bag?

1021
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:36,436
(laughter)

1022
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:38,592
MATT: Seemingly.

1023
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:43,263
MARY: Does it make her limp? So sorry.

1024
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:47,686
FELICIA: Oh goodness. Guys. We are going to have
to get some warm clothing. It seems like that. So

1025
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:48,986
let's go shopping.

1026
00:58:48,986 --> 00:58:50,135
LAURA: I love this plan.

1027
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:51,139
TRAVIS: Oh God.

1028
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:52,319
SAM: Dagon. Dagon?

1029
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,858
MATT: "It is! Dagon. Remember the name Dagon for
your song."

1030
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:55,915
SAM: I will definitely write a song for you.

1031
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:57,172
MATT: "I can write it down for you."

1032
00:58:57,172 --> 00:59:03,480
SAM: No, I can remember that. Will we have any
trouble finding this place? Will we need a guide?

1033
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,738
Someone who's possibly been there before? Would
that make the journey--

1034
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:12,519
MATT: "Oh, I ain't going back! Y'all's crazy if
you're going back there. I would say just look for

1035
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:15,773
"where the blizzard is coming from. That seemed to
be the harbinger of the beast."

1036
00:59:15,773 --> 00:59:17,316
LAURA: Go to the blizzard.

1037
00:59:17,316 --> 00:59:19,286
TRAVIS: Two days on horseback, or two days
walking?

1038
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:21,540
MATT: "Two days on horseback. Up the Glasswalk."

1039
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,230
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, we'll have to get horses,
too. Well, let's go.

1040
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:29,011
LAURA: Does the guild give you money for..?

1041
00:59:29,011 --> 00:59:30,785
FELICIA: Um.

1042
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:36,591
MATT: As far as you know, horses are provided to
full-fledged hunting members. You got the feeling,

1043
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:41,209
in your very, very brief preparation for this,
that part of the test was to secure your own

1044
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:42,508
transportation.

1045
00:59:42,508 --> 00:59:43,438
LAURA: Lovely.

1046
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:49,773
FELICIA: I think we are on our own. I mean, I
think it's part of our perseverance to prove that

1047
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:53,146
we are worthy of being-- I mean I am in the guild,
just to be clear.

1048
00:59:53,146 --> 00:59:54,531
SAM: You're a member?

1049
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:58,049
FELICIA: We are just going to have to-- Yes, I am
a member. Did you hear how I got in? It is really

1050
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,138
a fascinating story.

1051
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:00,552
SAM: No, I heard it was sort of a technicality.

1052
01:00:00,552 --> 01:00:01,595
FELICIA: Oh, well it was but--

1053
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:03,202
SAM: I can't wait to hear it.

1054
01:00:03,202 --> 01:00:04,757
FELICIA: Maybe around the campfire!

1055
01:00:04,757 --> 01:00:05,718
SAM: Yes.

1056
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:07,016
FELICIA: You could sing!

1057
01:00:07,016 --> 01:00:13,032
SAM: I could, if you told me the details. You know
what, I do forget a lot. Maybe you could just

1058
01:00:13,097 --> 01:00:16,038
write them down quietly to yourself and just give
me a note later.

1059
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:19,056
FELICIA: Okay, as long as it's a love story
between me and Aldor-- I'll tell you how to spell

1060
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:21,280
it. Okay! Well, let's go meet the rest of the
group!

1061
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,579
SAM: Thank you, Dagon.

1062
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:26,673
LAURA: As we're leaving, I walk up behind Lyra and
I put my hand on her shoulder, and then I reach

1063
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:32,536
down and grab her bag of gold and I (clears
throat) and look down to it and say, you might

1064
01:00:32,536 --> 01:00:37,283
want to keep a better eye on this, darling. There
are very very nasty people around.

1065
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:38,695
FELICIA: Oh my goodness.

1066
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:40,591
SAM: You're traveling with some of them.

1067
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:43,363
LAURA: I didn't take anything, I'm simply letting
you know.

1068
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:46,791
FELICIA: That is so nice of you! I'm going to buy
you the prettiest cloak as thanks.

1069
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,210
LAURA: Thank you so much, darling. You have lovely
eyes.

1070
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:54,517
FELICIA: Thank you! I've never had a friend
before! This is so great!

1071
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:57,373
LAURA: Maybe when we shop you can tell me all
about Aldor.

1072
01:00:57,373 --> 01:01:01,133
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, he is so handsome.

1073
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:05,718
MATT: As you guys step out of the tavern, you walk
up to the other members of your party: Zahra, Grog

1074
01:01:05,718 --> 01:01:06,956
and Percy.

1075
01:01:06,956 --> 01:01:08,089
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

1076
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:09,586
MARY: What have you discovered?

1077
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:11,176
SAM: Northwest. Cold.

1078
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:12,045
LAURA: Blizzards.

1079
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:13,394
SAM: Dragon. Blizzard.

1080
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:14,393
LAURA: It ices things.

1081
01:01:14,393 --> 01:01:15,749
SAM: Two days. We need horses.

1082
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:16,627
MARY: Two days?

1083
01:01:16,627 --> 01:01:19,164
LAURA: We'll definitely need some sort of
protection against ice attacks.

1084
01:01:19,164 --> 01:01:20,081
MARY: Right.

1085
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:23,931
TRAVIS: I have a question. I'm not good with
numbers, but it's a two days' journey there? And a

1086
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,340
two days' journey back?

1087
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:26,356
LAURA: Yeah.

1088
01:01:26,356 --> 01:01:27,528
TALIESIN: We do have an airship.

1089
01:01:27,528 --> 01:01:29,646
TRAVIS: Is that four, and we have three days to do
this in?

1090
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:30,866
TALIESIN: Don't we have an airship?

1091
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:33,008
LAURA: How are we going to do that exactly?

1092
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:35,043
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm not the brightest in the
bunch, but.

1093
01:01:35,043 --> 01:01:39,863
MATT: You know that contracts are complete upon
the quarry being slain.

1094
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,297
ALL: Oh!

1095
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:46,039
FELICIA: We have three days to get home. It's
hard. You were reading it a little bit fast

1096
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,192
MARY: Two days to get there and one day to slay
it?

1097
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:49,313
LAURA: Thereabouts, yes.

1098
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:50,661
MARY: Is that about it?

1099
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:54,974
MATT: Once the creature is actually slain, and the
pieces are harvested, then the contract is

1100
01:01:54,974 --> 01:01:57,195
completed. Then you can take your time returning.

1101
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:58,345
TRAVIS: Thank God.

1102
01:01:58,345 --> 01:02:00,722
MARY: Great. We can ride it down the mountain.

1103
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:01,622
TRAVIS: Really?

1104
01:02:01,622 --> 01:02:02,635
MARY: No.

1105
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,658
SAM: We need to get some horses up in this joint?

1106
01:02:04,658 --> 01:02:06,765
FELICIA: We need horses, we need cloaks, we need
furs, wools...

1107
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:12,500
LAURA: We definitely need warm things. Actually, I
have warm cloaks for the party and half of our

1108
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,871
party isn't here so we can have them.

1109
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:18,650
SAM: Will you need some cold weather clothes,
Zahra?

1110
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,879
MARY: I believe, it would be nice.

1111
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:23,104
SAM: And Lyra did you bring anything?

1112
01:02:23,104 --> 01:02:25,332
FELICIA: Well I can go by my uncle's house and get
pretty much anything.

1113
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,420
SAM: Yeah? Oh wait! Would he have enough for us?

1114
01:02:27,436 --> 01:02:31,607
FELICIA: Oh! Well goodness he's a trade ambassador
to here. It's funny. We have a lot of warehouses.

1115
01:02:31,607 --> 01:02:32,844
It's so funny.

1116
01:02:32,844 --> 01:02:34,033
SAM: Let's go do that!

1117
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:37,931
LAURA: Seriously? Wait, so does he give discounts
to family members?

1118
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:43,645
FELICIA: Oh I can just, you know. I can persuade
him to-- because he's nice and--

1119
01:02:43,645 --> 01:02:45,590
LAURA: Lyra, I think we're going to be best
friends!

1120
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,876
SAM: Way to bury the lede!

1121
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,352
MARY: Lyra, does he have access to horses?

1122
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,712
FELICIA: Um. I don't--

1123
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:54,244
MATT: You haven't ever had any sort of discussions
with him in regards to horses. You know there are

1124
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:57,052
a few liveries throughout town, but you don't
think you have any family ties to them directly.

1125
01:02:57,052 --> 01:03:02,561
FELICIA: Not directly. I mean, it's trade more
than that, but I know some places.

1126
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:04,101
SAM: Is this your Uncle Randy?

1127
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:05,917
FELICIA: Uncle Randy! Yes, you know about him?

1128
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:08,748
SAM: He's legend. His legend has been sung far and
wide.

1129
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:12,448
FELICIA: He's so fantastic. He's so kind-hearted.
He took me in when I was-- anyway we'll talk about

1130
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:15,082
it over fire camps!

1131
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,258
TALIESIN: Come on, everybody.

1132
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:19,038
LAURA: So can we find horses in the area?

1133
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:24,533
MATT: You briefly look about and you find a livery
not too far from the outskirts of this district.

1134
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:31,743
As you enter, the gentleman who runs it there is
eager, "Have you come to buy some horses? Well,

1135
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:33,129
"certainly."

1136
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:35,580
SAM: Rent them. Let's rent them for a week.

1137
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,482
MATT: "The thing about renting is, in this area if
you're riding out with horses, a lot of them don't

1138
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,771
"make their way back."

1139
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:43,948
LAURA: How about we rent them, and if they don't
make their way back we'll pay you the difference?

1140
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:45,459
SAM: We'll leave you a hefty deposit.

1141
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:50,248
MATT: "That could possibly work, yes."

1142
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:53,079
MARY: May I cast Suggestion?

1143
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,508
LAURA: Oh, try it. Do it!

1144
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:57,508
MARY: Are you all right? Am I all right to--

1145
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:58,622
SAM: Go for it.

1146
01:03:58,622 --> 01:04:00,302
MARY: I cast Suggestion.

1147
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:04,061
MATT: Okay, so while you guys are in this
conversation, you stay back and make a few symbols

1148
01:04:04,061 --> 01:04:08,246
with your fingers, whispering under your breath,
you complete the Suggestion spell. What's the DC

1149
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:14,539
of your spell? It should be on the top of your
spell page. The top of your actual sheet that has

1150
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:16,056
all your things listed.

1151
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:17,956
LAURA: DC 17.

1152
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:21,434
MATT: All right. What do you want to suggest?

1153
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:31,177
MARY: You shall lend us the horses, knowing that
we shall take very good care of them. We may keep

1154
01:04:31,177 --> 01:04:33,768
them for as long as we like.

1155
01:04:33,768 --> 01:04:38,669
MATT: As you're having this conversation he looks
over at the group and goes, "You know what? You

1156
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:46,469
"all look like a very trustworthy group. I wouldn't
wanna breed any sort of ill will for future

1157
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:47,523
"business."

1158
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:49,795
LAURA: Right. I mean, Uncle Randy after all.

1159
01:04:49,795 --> 01:04:54,427
MATT: "Tell you what. I'll give you the horses,
rental, half price. I trust you'll bring 'em back.

1160
01:04:54,427 --> 01:04:59,777
"Don't worry about any sort of deposit. I believe
you're trustworthy folk."

1161
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:01,213
SAM: Wow. Thank you, sir!

1162
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:02,116
LAURA: That's lovely.

1163
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:09,049
MATT: "So for six horses, we're look for a rental
price of around... Say, 50 gold for the lot, rental."

1164
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:10,327
TRAVIS: Done!

1165
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,609
LAURA: Wait, well--

1166
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:14,095
SAM: We can save a little if I shared a horse with
you.

1167
01:05:14,095 --> 01:05:19,005
FELICIA: Oh. Wha-- no. No, I'd rather have my own
horse. Thank you.

1168
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:19,966
SAM: Okay.

1169
01:05:19,966 --> 01:05:21,658
LAURA: You can ride with me, Scanlan.

1170
01:05:21,658 --> 01:05:22,758
SAM: No, thanks.

1171
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:24,879
(laughter)

1172
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,762
LAURA: But, Trinket--

1173
01:05:26,762 --> 01:05:28,655
TRAVIS: Shut down!

1174
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:30,728
LAURA: Does he ride-- is he as fast as a horse?

1175
01:05:30,924 --> 01:05:35,344
MATT: (chuckles) Trinket would probably be
struggling to keep up with you guys.

1176
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:36,791
LAURA: Well, how--

1177
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,766
SAM: Should we leave Trinket?

1178
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:38,518
LAURA: No!

1179
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:39,933
SAM: I always want to leave Trinket!

1180
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:41,752
LAURA: Why do you always wanna leave my wonderful
bear?!

1181
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:44,550
SAM: Because he only almost dies every time.

1182
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:48,366
LAURA: I know, he almost dies every time I put him
in battle. It's ridiculous.

1183
01:05:48,366 --> 01:05:50,318
FELICIA: I think he's adorable, and it would be 
really nice to have him along.

1184
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:51,967
LAURA: He is adorable, isn't he?

1185
01:05:51,967 --> 01:05:54,816
FELICIA: You guys, it's so beautiful to see
the friendship that you have. If I had that with

1186
01:05:54,876 --> 01:05:56,539
another person-- say, Aldor-- it would be--

1187
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:57,519
SAM: Aldor is--

1188
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:01,398
TRAVIS: Oh God. Do you have any Clydesdales or
giant horses for me?

1189
01:06:01,543 --> 01:06:03,241
TALIESIN: Have you thought of getting a cat, by
any chance?

1190
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:04,015
FELICIA: Hm?

1191
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:05,364
TALIESIN: Just a suggestion. I don't know.

1192
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:09,822
MATT: "I think we could... probably facilitate. I
can't say that it'll have much of a shelf life,

1193
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:11,913
"depending on how much you ride it, but--"

1194
01:06:11,913 --> 01:06:13,532
TRAVIS: That's what people say about me. That's
fine.

1195
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:17,803
MATT: He pulls out a very, very nice looking
warhorse that looks like it's designed to carry

1196
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:21,174
very heavy soldiers. Still unproven as to whether
or not it will be able to carry you,

1197
01:06:21,174 --> 01:06:22,103
but we shall see.

1198
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,054
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1199
01:06:23,054 --> 01:06:26,343
MATT: And once again, the horse travel wasn't two
days of straight gallop. It was--

1200
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:27,190
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

1201
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:31,057
MATT: A casual trot, in which Trinket could
probably keep up, but you guys might have to take

1202
01:06:31,057 --> 01:06:32,913
a break every now and then, because he's still a
bear.

1203
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:34,916
LAURA: Okay. Well, it's doable.

1204
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,370
TRAVIS: Make him earn it!

1205
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,823
TALIESIN: At the bear-est mean.

1206
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:38,817
MATT: Oh.

1207
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:41,289
TALIESIN: I've got, like, five more. I've been
saving them up for this entire game.

1208
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,005
SAM: I missed...

1209
01:06:43,005 --> 01:06:45,544
TALIESIN: Nothing. No-- it's nothing.

1210
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:46,697
TRAVIS: Oh, puns yeah.

1211
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:48,604
MATT: For every bear pun that happens, an angel
loses its wings.

1212
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,742
MARY: So do we give you our gold and--

1213
01:06:49,742 --> 01:06:51,037
SAM: Yes, yes. Here's our gold.

1214
01:06:51,037 --> 01:06:52,407
MATT: Certainly, certainly! I'll get you your
horses.

1215
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:54,036
LAURA: Wait, who's-- who's paying?

1216
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:55,089
TRAVIS: The party is.

1217
01:06:55,089 --> 01:06:56,633
LAURA: But it-- half our party isn't here, so--

1218
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:57,522
TRAVIS: Vex.

1219
01:06:57,522 --> 01:06:58,951
FELICIA: I'll just-- Don't, don't-- I'll just do
it!

1220
01:06:58,951 --> 01:06:59,823
SAM: Oh, thank you!

1221
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:01,972
FELICIA: There you go. Thank you! Bye-bye, nice to
meet you!

1222
01:07:01,972 --> 01:07:02,960
MATT: "Thank you kindly."

1223
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,460
TALIESIN: Oh! You're so kind! That's excellent.

1224
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:05,538
TRAVIS: Thanks, Lyra

1225
01:07:05,538 --> 01:07:07,269
MARY: Well done, Lyra. Very good.

1226
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:12,848
FELICIA: Now, I need to talk with you. Can-- can
we go out? Are we leaving yet?

1227
01:07:12,848 --> 01:07:13,967
(laughter)

1228
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:19,156
MATT: Yes. The stable boy is bringing the horses
over, the rest of you begin like putting your

1229
01:07:19,156 --> 01:07:23,399
materials up and strapping them to the saddles.
And what did you want to do?

1230
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:27,000
FELICIA: Listen, missy. I am a leader of this, and
the fact that you pulled out a spell and did not

1231
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,369
say-- and it is just-- it's just not even the way
I want to conduct my team. So. You. If you're

1232
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:36,485
going to use underhanded tactics you need to clear
them with me first because I am the leader.

1233
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,736
MARY: My spellcasting is actually overhand,
but...

1234
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:41,639
FELICIA: Wha--?

1235
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,328
MARY: I understand. And I shall keep that in mind,
and I do apologize.

1236
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:46,618
FELICIA: Really?

1237
01:07:46,618 --> 01:07:53,174
MARY: Yes, I apologize very deeply. Very, very
sincerely.

1238
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:54,829
FELICIA: I was just a leader! I did it.

1239
01:07:54,829 --> 01:07:55,990
TALIESIN: Oh, well done!

1240
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,352
FELICIA: Yay! We're going to have a great
journey!

1241
01:07:58,352 --> 01:08:00,816
SAM: That was impressive. You put her in her
place.

1242
01:08:00,816 --> 01:08:01,672
FELICIA: I did!

1243
01:08:01,672 --> 01:08:02,984
SAM: Asserted yourself, but you were--

1244
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:03,982
FELICIA: Firm, but polite, right?

1245
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:04,872
TALIESIN: You were firm, but fair.

1246
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,215
SAM: Firm, but fair. Yes.

1247
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:09,430
LAURA: I am very, very nervous that somebody is
going to die when we fight this dragon.

1248
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:11,032
TRAVIS: Oh, I hope it's me.

1249
01:08:11,032 --> 01:08:16,876
MATT: So. Horses ready and mounted up? You guys
gather all the rest of your materials, you ride up

1250
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:25,265
back through the Braving Grounds to the
northwestern exit to the outside wall.

1251
01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:26,166
Anything else?

1252
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:30,068
LAURA: Ooh! So, protection against ice magic. Does
anybody have stuff that works for that?

1253
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:31,633
SAM: Didn't we need to go to Uncle Randy's?

1254
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:32,765
LAURA: Lyra do you know any--

1255
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:34,534
FELICIA: Well, we were going to go and get
some...

1256
01:08:34,534 --> 01:08:35,341
MATT: That's right.

1257
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:38,039
FELICIA: Yeah, we're going to go to the warehouse
that's on the edge of the district.

1258
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:38,884
MATT: Okay.

1259
01:08:38,884 --> 01:08:41,512
FELICIA: Where we're going, we're going to get
some furs and all that sort of stuff.

1260
01:08:41,512 --> 01:08:46,064
MATT: Easy enough. You guys follow Lyra down to
the outside of the Quadroads. There is one

1261
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:50,761
warehouse she goes to, she knocks on the door and
as it opens up, you can see a rather comely

1262
01:08:50,761 --> 01:09:01,291
looking gentleman with a nice soft, almost a
purple-blue beret. Little bit of a heavyset neck

1263
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:07,412
bulge that rests over the top of his little
doublet. And he opens it and he looks up. "Eh,

1264
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:09,628
what can I-- oh Lyra."

1265
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:12,519
FELICIA: Hi! Oh my gosh. How are you?!

1266
01:09:12,519 --> 01:09:14,969
MATT: (groans) "What do you want this time?"

1267
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:19,704
FELICIA: Well, it's funny. Because I finally got
an assignment with the guild! Can you believe it?

1268
01:09:19,752 --> 01:09:21,813
It's like whoa! Uncle Randy's going to be so--

1269
01:09:21,813 --> 01:09:23,157
MATT: "No, I can't believe it."

1270
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:24,292
FELICIA: Oh. Really?

1271
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:25,753
MATT: "But good for you."

1272
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:28,417
FELICIA: Thank you! So anyway, me and my friends--
these are my friends now.

1273
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:30,396
SAM: You know what? She's sort of our leader.

1274
01:09:30,396 --> 01:09:31,405
TALIESIN: Hello.

1275
01:09:31,405 --> 01:09:32,842
SAM: If you must know, Randy.

1276
01:09:32,842 --> 01:09:33,929
FELICIA: Right?!

1277
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:41,617
MATT: He gives a very, very long, judgmental,
mistrusting look across all five of you.

1278
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:43,433
LAURA: Should we call you uncle?

1279
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,642
MATT: "Please, don't."

1280
01:09:45,642 --> 01:09:47,912
(laughter)

1281
01:09:47,912 --> 01:09:51,173
SAM: You know what, Mister Randy? We had our
doubts about your--

1282
01:09:51,173 --> 01:09:54,973
FELICIA: Oh, no that's not-- No no no no, he's not
my uncle. No-- my uncle is not here, he's just--

1283
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:56,459
this is just one of his--

1284
01:09:56,522 --> 01:09:57,534
LAURA: Oh!

1285
01:09:57,534 --> 01:09:59,229
FELICIA: Managers. Yeah, very important.

1286
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:00,248
SAM: Oh, okay.

1287
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:03,098
FELICIA: He's going to be-- Uncle Randy is going
to eat his hat, isn't he? I got a leadership

1288
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:06,121
position! Anyway, can you help us out?

1289
01:10:06,121 --> 01:10:07,863
MATT: "What do you need, Lyra?"

1290
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:10,420
FELICIA: We're going into the cold-- we're going
into a blizzard, can you believe that? And you

1291
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,838
know how much I hate the cold, but we do need to
be provisioned, so what do we have in the crates

1292
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:15,098
that we can help...?

1293
01:10:15,098 --> 01:10:16,665
MATT: He closes the door.

1294
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:20,845
(laughter)

1295
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:22,383
MATT: A minute goes by.

1296
01:10:22,383 --> 01:10:23,144
SAM: Did you--

1297
01:10:23,144 --> 01:10:24,087
LAURA: Um, I thought--

1298
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,144
MATT: Two minutes go by.

1299
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:26,643
FELICIA: Oh, he's going to hook us up. He's going
to hook us up, really.

1300
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:27,492
SAM: Really?

1301
01:10:27,492 --> 01:10:29,196
FELICIA: Uh! (Knocks)

1302
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:38,218
MARY: I use Mask of Many Faces and I disguise
myself as Uncle Frank.

1303
01:10:38,218 --> 01:10:39,420
LAURA: Uncle Randy?

1304
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:40,591
MARY: Uncle Randy!

1305
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:41,607
(laughter)

1306
01:10:41,607 --> 01:10:43,475
MARY: Frankly, my dear! I am Uncle Randy.

1307
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:45,156
TRAVIS: Bob? Peter?

1308
01:10:45,156 --> 01:10:46,249
TALIESIN: Don't talk to Frank anymore.

1309
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:47,130
MATT: All right. You have not seen Uncle Randy.

1310
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:47,978
MARY: Oh, balls!

1311
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,020
MATT: Which is the only downside to that.

1312
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,204
MARY: Balls and a half!

1313
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,223
MATT: Um. You could--

1314
01:10:51,223 --> 01:10:52,259
(laughter)

1315
01:10:52,259 --> 01:10:54,001
MARY: There's no pictures on the wall anywhere I
could look at outside?

1316
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,118
SAM: Just go on Facebook. Facebook!

1317
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:59,214
MARY: A great big, beautiful... this is where he
sells things! Great.

1318
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:02,275
MATT: Unfortunately, no. But if there's any other
form you'd like to take you're welcome to.

1319
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:05,461
MARY: (whispers) Bollocks.

1320
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,393
TALIESIN: Oh, bloody hell. I'm going to knock
loudly.

1321
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:11,722
FELICIA: Well, this is just very-- this is is a
very egg-on-face situation.

1322
01:11:11,722 --> 01:11:14,192
TRAVIS: He's looking for stuff, right? He's--

1323
01:11:14,192 --> 01:11:18,073
MATT: The door opens at this point, almost pushing
you back on your heels. You catch yourself as he

1324
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:26,591
comes out carrying a large pile of what look like
relatively well-kept furs and thick leather

1325
01:11:26,591 --> 01:11:34,596
cloaks, and shoves them into your arms. "Be safe,
little one." (bff) Closes the door.

1326
01:11:34,596 --> 01:11:35,477
SAM: Bye.

1327
01:11:35,477 --> 01:11:37,095
TALIESIN: We'll try to get her back in one piece.

1328
01:11:37,095 --> 01:11:39,672
FELICIA: Thank you. That's sweet. See? I came
through, guys. I came through.

1329
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:40,694
TALIESIN and SAM: You did!

1330
01:11:40,694 --> 01:11:42,054
FELICIA: Just remember, that I came through.

1331
01:11:42,054 --> 01:11:45,499
SAM: We'll write a good comment card when we get
back.

1332
01:11:45,499 --> 01:11:46,544
LAURA: Definitely.

1333
01:11:46,544 --> 01:11:48,833
MARY: Can I get the one that's slit up the back so
my tail doesn't--

1334
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:55,383
SAM: All right, we're loaded up. We've got horses,
we've got healing potions, we've got--

1335
01:11:55,383 --> 01:11:57,222
MARY: Loaded for bear, as it were.

1336
01:11:57,222 --> 01:11:59,748
LAURA: We're great. Trinket's wonderful.

1337
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:00,910
MARY: Yes, he is!

1338
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,834
MATT: He nuzzles up alongside
Vex.

1339
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:05,571
SAM: Shall we set off?

1340
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,597
TRAVIS: Go? Yeah.

1341
01:12:06,597 --> 01:12:07,669
MARY: Yes, let's do.

1342
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:10,094
SAM: Do you want to go, one more time to the
Braving Grounds, Grog, and just--

1343
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:10,900
LAURA: No.

1344
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,414
SAM: Try your hand against-- no?

1345
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,732
TALIESIN: Why don't we slay the dragon first, and
then--

1346
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:16,675
LAURA: Yeah.

1347
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,054
TALIESIN: Then he can punch things.

1348
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:19,399
LAURA: Since we're on a time crunch, Scanlan.

1349
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:20,526
SAM: You're right. You're right, there is a--

1350
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:21,796
MARY: Everyone is good on weapons?

1351
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:22,797
LAURA: I'd say yes.

1352
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:27,019
TRAVIS: I haven't finished my training montage
yet. Got to run through the snow, got to do

1353
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:28,077
pullups on trees.

1354
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,448
MARY: (sings) Gonna need a montage.

1355
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:30,321
TRAVIS: Inverted sit-ups--

1356
01:12:30,321 --> 01:12:31,834
MARY: (sings) Even Phillip had a--

1357
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:33,638
MARY and TRAVIS: (sings) Montage!

1358
01:12:33,638 --> 01:12:36,105
SAM: All right, we go west along the Glass...
Hand... Road.

1359
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:37,569
TALIESIN: Glasswalk Road.

1360
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:42,255
MATT: You embark on the Glasswalk Road, which
forms right on the outskirts of the Braving

1361
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:47,758
Grounds. You are let through the front gates of
the outside of the Vesper Timberlands, and this is

1362
01:12:47,758 --> 01:12:52,887
the first time you've actually seen a formal road
that is carved and at least traversed enough that

1363
01:12:52,887 --> 01:12:57,164
the Timberland hasn't completely consumed it. You
can still see various tree roots and branches are

1364
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:03,538
progressively, almost angrily, pushing in towards
this gate, but you get the feeling based on the

1365
01:13:03,538 --> 01:13:06,544
cuts that whoever goes through here-- at least
some people go through here, they keep it

1366
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:12,110
relatively well-kept for travel up north. You ride
out into it and the canopy almost completely

1367
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:24,187
encloses it, so it's like a tunnel of very dense
tree, vine, and leaf structure. You push forward

1368
01:13:24,392 --> 01:13:31,378
out into the cold air and begin to ride for the
remainder of the day. A good eight or nine hours

1369
01:13:31,378 --> 01:13:38,304
hit before the chill begins to grow. The sun
begins to find itself setting across the far

1370
01:13:38,304 --> 01:13:42,884
mountains, and the forest around you grows darker
and darker still.

1371
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:45,443
LAURA: Probably need to make camp.

1372
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:48,491
FELICIA: I think we should make camp! 
I-- should we make camp? Yes! We should

1373
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:49,830
make camp!

1374
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,882
MARY: I shall take first watch.

1375
01:13:51,882 --> 01:13:54,221
TRAVIS: I have a firewood bundle that we can make
a fire with.

1376
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,157
LAURA: There's also lots of wood around, Grog.

1377
01:13:57,157 --> 01:13:58,016
MARY: Yes.

1378
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:03,154
TRAVIS: And I have an axe. Let's do that instead.
Can I find a really tiny tree and start hacking

1379
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:04,173
away at it?

1380
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,243
SAM: Tiny?

1381
01:14:05,243 --> 01:14:08,376
TRAVIS: Yeah, tiny. We don't need to kill, like,
Grandpa Tree. We kill Baby Tree.

1382
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,234
LAURA: Keyleth would be proud.

1383
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:12,983
TRAVIS: Don't-- how about don't tell Keyleth?

1384
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:14,532
LAURA: I miss my brother.

1385
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:20,712
MATT: Okay. You guys get off of the main road, as
that's probably not a very good area to be out in

1386
01:14:20,712 --> 01:14:27,943
the open. You find, after about a five to ten
minute walk, a small opening and along the way you

1387
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:32,621
find a tree that looks viable. There's a small
slope of hill that heads up to an upper platform

1388
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:36,801
area maybe about five to ten feet up, and a small
opening that you think would be a fitting place to

1389
01:14:36,801 --> 01:14:42,720
put a fire that wouldn't be in danger of setting
the nearby vegetation aflame. You go ahead and

1390
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,371
start looking for firewood. Go ahead and make an
athletics roll.

1391
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:51,472
TRAVIS: 16.

1392
01:14:51,472 --> 01:14:57,361
MATT: All right. After a good 15, 20 minute
period-- relatively brief for most folk-- you come

1393
01:14:57,361 --> 01:15:01,824
back with a nice, hefty stack of firewood from the
driest small tree you could find.

1394
01:15:01,824 --> 01:15:02,974
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

1395
01:15:02,974 --> 01:15:03,978
TRAVIS: Hey, Zahra?

1396
01:15:03,978 --> 01:15:04,782
MARY: Well done.

1397
01:15:04,782 --> 01:15:05,732
TRAVIS: Impressed?

1398
01:15:05,732 --> 01:15:07,031
MARY: Yes.

1399
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:10,552
(laughter)

1400
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:13,237
SAM: Kord's strength to you, sir.

1401
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:18,745
MATT: Throwing the wood down, you begin to set up
small stones into a fire pit establishment, and

1402
01:15:18,745 --> 01:15:26,984
begin building a fire as the entirety of the sun
disappears behind the distant mountain range. At

1403
01:15:26,984 --> 01:15:30,469
this point, the temperature has gotten extremely
cold, and most of you begin to pull up your winter

1404
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:35,867
cloaks and get your bedrolls ready for an
evening's bit of rest. Is there anything in

1405
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:40,784
particular that you guys want to do before the
night and sleep take you?

1406
01:15:40,784 --> 01:15:43,340
MARY: I would like to go out. Has the moon risen?

1407
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:51,338
MATT: About two hours into nightfall, you can see
a gentle bit of moonlight begin to appear off the

1408
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:56,181
distant horizon to the northeast, from your
position. It's hard to see because the trees are

1409
01:15:56,181 --> 01:16:00,195
so thick, but you take a moment to walk through,
and you can see little bits of

1410
01:16:00,195 --> 01:16:01,787
the moonlight peeking.

1411
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:07,457
MARY: I just bask in what little rays I can for
ten, 15 minutes before retiring.

1412
01:16:07,457 --> 01:16:10,433
MATT: All right. Anything else you wish to do?

1413
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:19,162
FELICIA: I'm going to change my stone, my
Transmuter Stone, to be resisting ice or cold.

1414
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:20,675
LAURA: Ah, that's really good.

1415
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:21,591
TALIESIN: Clever.

1416
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:23,102
MATT: Good call. Good call, indeed.

1417
01:16:23,102 --> 01:16:28,138
LAURA: I need something like that. Do we have any
magic stuff that makes us resistant?

1418
01:16:28,138 --> 01:16:33,919
MARY: I have a Ring of Protection. May I do that
around the camp?

1419
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,491
MATT: The Ring of Protection is an actual ring you
wear.

1420
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,583
MARY: Oh! I have a ring.

1421
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,688
MATT: Yes, and it protects you.

1422
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:38,930
MARY: And it protects me.

1423
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,034
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

1424
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:42,710
MARY: You see? I'm learning everything. Not all at
once.

1425
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:43,911
LAURA: I have one, too.

1426
01:16:43,911 --> 01:16:45,490
MARY: Oh, you do? Oh, yours is nice.

1427
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,096
MATT: Very helpful.

1428
01:16:48,096 --> 01:16:54,743
LAURA: Yeah, but we don't have any ice-resistant
things, outside of that damn--

1429
01:16:54,896 --> 01:16:57,882
TALIESIN: Or fire spells. Fire spells would be
very--

1430
01:16:57,882 --> 01:16:59,311
FELICIA: Oh, I have a fire spell.

1431
01:16:59,311 --> 01:17:00,131
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1432
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:02,406
FELICIA: That's how I took down the worg. So,
anyway, we were in the forest--

1433
01:17:02,406 --> 01:17:09,549
MARY: How powerful is it? Because I can conjure
something and it would be very-- too large for

1434
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:10,771
this particular--

1435
01:17:10,771 --> 01:17:14,368
FELICIA: I mean, I think a Fireball would not help
here. I can do Firebolt, but there's really no use

1436
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:15,456
until we get there.

1437
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:16,502
LAURA: Are we starting a fire?

1438
01:17:16,502 --> 01:17:17,431
FELICIA: I can start the fire.

1439
01:17:17,431 --> 01:17:18,880
SAM: Do we not have a fire going?

1440
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,076
LAURA: Yeah, of course we do.

1441
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:24,864
MATT: You guys look over and Grog is sitting
there, rubbing wood together.

1442
01:17:24,864 --> 01:17:26,592
LAURA: Grog, one second. Here--

1443
01:17:26,592 --> 01:17:28,218
TRAVIS: No, I'm probably getting so close.

1444
01:17:28,218 --> 01:17:29,910
(laughter)

1445
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:32,357
TRAVIS: Fine. Take all the joy out of everything.

1446
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:38,094
MATT: The ranger, who is very well-experienced in
surviving in woodland areas, starts the fire that

1447
01:17:38,094 --> 01:17:45,359
had taken you a good five, six minutes of
aggressively fighting against the water-soaked

1448
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:49,019
wood of this woodland. (snaps) She lights the
flames.

1449
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,854
TRAVIS: I warmed it up first.

1450
01:17:50,854 --> 01:17:52,634
LAURA: Thank you, Grog. You did. You really did.

1451
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:53,810
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're welcome.

1452
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,080
MATT: All right. Anyone keeping watch?

1453
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,252
TALIESIN: I'll keep watch.

1454
01:17:56,252 --> 01:17:57,808
MATT: All right, so you're taking first watch.

1455
01:17:57,808 --> 01:17:58,746
TALIESIN: I'll take first watch.

1456
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:01,392
SAM: She had already-- Zahra had volunteered.

1457
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:02,732
FELICIA: Zahra had first watch.

1458
01:18:02,732 --> 01:18:03,801
TALIESIN: I'll take second watch, then.

1459
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:04,746
FELICIA: You can take second watch.

1460
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,412
MATT: All right, so Zahra takes first watch. Percy
takes second watch.

1461
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:07,901
LAURA: Can I watch with Zahra?

1462
01:18:07,901 --> 01:18:09,255
MATT: If you'd like to.

1463
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,125
TRAVIS: Third watch.

1464
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,320
MATT: Third watch for Grog. All right.

1465
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,178
SAM: No watch.

1466
01:18:12,178 --> 01:18:14,810
FELICIA: I'm-- I would take watch, just for the
record, but I just get so peckish--

1467
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,670
TRAVIS: You just sleep. You need your beauty
rest.

1468
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,161
SAM: I'm sleeping, yes. Thank you.

1469
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:20,219
TALIESIN: You're going to be clear for leading
tomorrow.

1470
01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:23,645
FELICIA: I really need my head clear, and I just
cannot function without sleep.

1471
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:24,834
There was one time, when I--

1472
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,442
TRAVIS: Oh, man. No, no, yeah.

1473
01:18:26,442 --> 01:18:27,711
MARY: I think-- shall we?

1474
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:28,617
LAURA: Yes.

1475
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:30,030
MARY: First watch, Percy.

1476
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:30,974
LAURA: No.

1477
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:32,221
MARY: Oh, is it you and I?

1478
01:18:32,221 --> 01:18:33,159
LAURA: It was us.

1479
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:34,063
TALIESIN: I'm second watch.

1480
01:18:34,063 --> 01:18:35,077
MARY: I'm so sorry.

1481
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:39,508
MATT: All right. As the rest of you make your
bedrolls, prepare and gather around the fire,

1482
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:43,931
eventually drift off to sleep. Vex and Zahra are
left awake.

1483
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:52,360
MARY: You need help carrying your purse? Your
bag?

1484
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,071
LAURA: Oh, no. It's quite comfortable against my
side, actually.

1485
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:56,912
MARY: Could I feel how heavy it is?

1486
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:59,391
LAURA: It's not heavy at all. We don't have
anything in it, darling.

1487
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:00,342
MARY: Oh, all right.

1488
01:19:00,342 --> 01:19:02,331
LAURA: Where do you come from?

1489
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:08,572
MARY: (exhales) I come--

1490
01:19:08,572 --> 01:19:11,810
LAURA: We just don't see very many tieflings
around here.

1491
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:16,599
MARY: No. I come from very far away. It took quite
a long time for me to get here. I come from the

1492
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,095
land of Feren.

1493
01:19:18,095 --> 01:19:19,074
LAURA: Feren.

1494
01:19:19,074 --> 01:19:25,137
MARY: Yes. Very far-off, mountainous, dark. Very
dark.

1495
01:19:25,137 --> 01:19:28,423
LAURA: And you left because...?

1496
01:19:28,423 --> 01:19:39,924
MARY: My father was killed, and I was left on my
own in the woods, so I left.

1497
01:19:39,924 --> 01:19:42,593
LAURA: That sounds familiar.

1498
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:44,012
MARY: Oh, it does?

1499
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,613
LAURA: Yes, actually.

1500
01:19:45,613 --> 01:19:47,004
MARY: Why? Why is that?

1501
01:19:47,004 --> 01:19:48,406
LAURA: My mother was killed.

1502
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:49,415
MARY: She was?

1503
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:50,279
LAURA: Yes.

1504
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:51,278
MARY: By whom?

1505
01:19:51,278 --> 01:19:54,998
LAURA: A dragon. (sighs) I wonder if it was
white.

1506
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:57,178
MARY: I wonder if it was.

1507
01:19:57,178 --> 01:19:59,573
TRAVIS: Shit. I mean, (snores)

1508
01:19:59,573 --> 01:20:01,054
MARY: What about your father?

1509
01:20:01,054 --> 01:20:02,343
LAURA: My father's alive.

1510
01:20:02,343 --> 01:20:03,837
MARY: And what is he?

1511
01:20:03,837 --> 01:20:05,373
LAURA: An asshole, actually.

1512
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:06,937
MARY: Really? Mine was an asshole too.

1513
01:20:06,937 --> 01:20:07,879
LAURA: Really?

1514
01:20:07,879 --> 01:20:09,477
MARY: He was. He was a dark wizard. He was awful.

1515
01:20:09,477 --> 01:20:11,534
LAURA: Oh, wow. Mine's just a jerk.

1516
01:20:11,534 --> 01:20:13,327
MARY: He kept me in a cage.

1517
01:20:13,327 --> 01:20:15,584
LAURA: Zahra.

1518
01:20:15,584 --> 01:20:16,647
MARY: I know.

1519
01:20:16,647 --> 01:20:18,549
LAURA: Getting a bit personal here around the
fire.

1520
01:20:18,549 --> 01:20:22,325
MARY: Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

1521
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:26,192
LAURA: (laughs) Here. Have some food.

1522
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:28,526
MARY: Thank you. God, what is this?

1523
01:20:28,526 --> 01:20:31,273
LAURA: Disgusting. Grog found it. I don't know.

1524
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:32,376
TRAVIS: It's wood.

1525
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:38,073
MARY: Is it wood? All right, well at least it's
elm.

1526
01:20:38,073 --> 01:20:40,240
LAURA: Oh.

1527
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:45,089
MATT: As you guys munch and awkwardly make your
way through conversation through the evening,

1528
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:47,752
eventually your watch comes to a close, and you
guys are able to rest.

1529
01:20:47,752 --> 01:20:49,826
Percy, you take up second watch.

1530
01:20:49,826 --> 01:20:50,995
TALIESIN: I do.

1531
01:20:50,995 --> 01:20:58,954
MATT: About three, four hours go by--

1532
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,726
TALIESIN: (whispers) Oh, bollocks.

1533
01:21:00,726 --> 01:21:06,928
MATT: Without incident. Eventually, your watch
comes to a close. You find yourself just past the

1534
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:10,618
middle of the night period of the evening. Who has
the third watch? Is that--

1535
01:21:10,618 --> 01:21:11,748
TRAVIS: I do.

1536
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:12,875
MATT: Grog. All right.

1537
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:13,681
TALIESIN: Wake up, Grog.

1538
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:15,519
TRAVIS: What? Mom? (screams and flails)

1539
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:16,526
LAURA: Ugh. Grog.

1540
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:17,678
TRAVIS: Sorry.

1541
01:21:17,678 --> 01:21:20,324
MARY: Is he always this loud?

1542
01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:21,998
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yes.

1543
01:21:21,998 --> 01:21:23,029
MARY: All right.

1544
01:21:23,029 --> 01:21:26,876
TRAVIS: All right, keep sleeping! (whispers) I
mean, keep sleeping. You're safe while I'm out.

1545
01:21:26,876 --> 01:21:28,377
FELICIA: Aldor! What? Huh?

1546
01:21:28,377 --> 01:21:33,416
(laughter)

1547
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:39,970
MATT: As the rest of you maintain or continue your
sleep. Grog keeps a very watchful eye in the

1548
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:45,929
darkened woods around. Grog, go ahead and 
make a perception check.

1549
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:47,343
TRAVIS: Shit. Me?

1550
01:21:47,343 --> 01:21:48,158
MATT: Yeah.

1551
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:49,198
SAM: Oh, he's the worst.

1552
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:55,437
TRAVIS: I see everything. Yes! Minus... 16.

1553
01:21:55,437 --> 01:21:56,976
MATT: 16. That's good.

1554
01:21:56,976 --> 01:22:10,461
All right. As you're keeping your eyes
around for any sort of dangerous or encroaching

1555
01:22:10,527 --> 01:22:19,170
villainy, the fire itself is slightly mesmerizing
in its pattern, and you look off to the right. You

1556
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:25,289
hear the slight snapping of a twig about 15, 20
feet off from the camp.

1557
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:27,955
TRAVIS: I go to check it out by myself.

1558
01:22:27,955 --> 01:22:29,600
LAURA: What? (groans)

1559
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,881
MATT: Okay. You stand up, lifting your axe and
begin to take a few steps away from the camp. As

1560
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:40,081
you turn around one of the nearby tree trunks, the
first thing you're greeted by in the darkness-- do

1561
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:41,505
you have Darkvision?

1562
01:22:41,505 --> 01:22:47,053
TRAVIS: I have low-- Wait, the Dwarven Belt of
Beard Power gives me-- I have Darkvision out to a

1563
01:22:47,053 --> 01:22:48,151
range of 60 feet.

1564
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:49,001
SAM: Wow.

1565
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:55,106
MATT: You do. So as you turn the corner, you get
about a step before you notice, about 15 feet away

1566
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:55,825
from you--

1567
01:22:55,825 --> 01:22:56,879
SAM: Your beard tingles.

1568
01:22:56,879 --> 01:23:06,380
MATT: There is a very large fur-covered, wolf-like
creature that is (snarls).

1569
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,422
MARY: Is it a worg?

1570
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:12,390
MATT: Snarling at you with bony protrusions from
parts of its body. It stands, from ground to top

1571
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:19,500
of its shoulder, almost up to your entire height,
and it is currently snarling, and behind it you

1572
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:24,143
can see there are two very gingerly stepping
humanoid figures in the darkness.

1573
01:23:24,143 --> 01:23:27,409
TRAVIS: (chuckles) I yell out, PLAYTIME!

1574
01:23:27,409 --> 01:23:30,900
MATT: As you all wake up--

1575
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,162
MARY: Where is he?

1576
01:23:32,162 --> 01:23:33,843
MATT: We're going to go to our break.

1577
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:36,104
(cheering)

1578
01:23:36,104 --> 01:23:42,468
MATT: All right, so we're gonna take a quick break
here for us to go ahead and feed real fast on the

1579
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:45,709
wonderful food purchased by our beautiful
chatroom.

1580
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:47,668
(cheering)

1581
01:23:47,668 --> 01:23:51,208
MATT: And we'll be back here. We're also going to
show a really cool video as we recently put up our

1582
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:56,883
challenge to the Critter-verse-- of all the
Critters that watch the show, the-- (chuckles),

1583
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:01,652
the Cancer Cream Pie Challenge. Those of you who
haven't seen it can go look it up.

1584
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:02,498
LAURA: Cream cancer.

1585
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:03,351
MATT: Cream cancer.

1586
01:24:03,351 --> 01:24:04,369
MARY: Cream cancer.

1587
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:05,050
MATT: Yeah.

1588
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,097
TALIESIN: Cancer of the cream.

1589
01:24:06,097 --> 01:24:08,957
MATT: Cancer of the cream, if you will. A bunch of
our fans took up the challenge, and there's a

1590
01:24:08,957 --> 01:24:12,197
wonderful video compilation of that. We'll go
ahead and put that up here in a moment, but we'll

1591
01:24:12,197 --> 01:24:16,377
be back shortly to to see what dangers have been
unveiled in the nearby forest.

1592
01:24:16,377 --> 01:24:17,289
TRAVIS: Yar.

1593
01:24:17,289 --> 01:24:18,665
MATT: See you momentarily.

1594
01:24:18,665 --> 01:33:49,561
[break]

1595
01:33:49,668 --> 01:33:55,209
MATT: Welcome back. So, a couple things we wanted
to mention before we jump back into the game. I'm

1596
01:33:55,357 --> 01:33:58,783
sure you guys have noticed our new format. We're
trying out different-- new visual styles for the

1597
01:33:58,783 --> 01:34:04,043
show to match the mood and up the quality of it.
We're working out some kinks and appreciate you

1598
01:34:04,043 --> 01:34:07,851
hanging with us in that, and things will
progressively get better as we push forward from

1599
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:12,869
here. We hope you like the new format. This is all
put together by our wonderful Overlord and his

1600
01:34:12,869 --> 01:34:20,698
crack team of twitch experts. Also, wanted to
mention to you guys the '5k and a bear' t-shirts

1601
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:23,479
that are up because of the ridiculous Trinket--

1602
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:26,062
LAURA: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1603
01:34:26,062 --> 01:34:30,223
MATT: 5k arrival from last week's episode, is
available for one more day. So if you want to get

1604
01:34:30,271 --> 01:34:34,567
that, get it soon, because once it's gone it's
gone. So make sure to go check that out if you're

1605
01:34:34,567 --> 01:34:43,744
interested. Other than that, are we good to go
ahead and continue? Perfect. All right. First and

1606
01:34:43,801 --> 01:34:47,132
foremost, I would like everyone to roll
initiative.

1607
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:47,939
LAURA: Oh God.

1608
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:49,012
TALIESIN: Yay!

1609
01:34:49,012 --> 01:34:50,796
LAURA: How did I just immediately forget that's
what we were doing?

1610
01:34:50,796 --> 01:34:51,764
MARY: How do I do that?

1611
01:34:51,764 --> 01:34:52,552
TRAVIS: You take a d20.

1612
01:34:52,552 --> 01:34:53,479
MARY: Okay.

1613
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,712
TRAVIS: And roll it.

1614
01:34:54,712 --> 01:34:55,647
TALIESIN: Eh.

1615
01:34:55,647 --> 01:34:56,837
FELICIA: (retches)

1616
01:34:56,837 --> 01:35:00,008
TRAVIS: Look at that. Add initiative, which is...

1617
01:35:00,008 --> 01:35:02,163
MARY: Oh. Heh. I don't know how that's possible,
but yeah!

1618
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:03,934
TRAVIS: Shit. Better.

1619
01:35:03,934 --> 01:35:05,498
FELICIA: Oh, it's a pen.

1620
01:35:05,498 --> 01:35:06,930
TALIESIN: There should be a laser in there
somewhere.

1621
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,185
FELICIA: Oh yeah!

1622
01:35:08,185 --> 01:35:11,547
TALIESIN: So that way you can vaguely say, move me
there.

1623
01:35:11,547 --> 01:35:12,845
FELICIA: I love it.

1624
01:35:12,845 --> 01:35:16,716
LAURA: Oh! I have to put my glasses on today.

1625
01:35:16,716 --> 01:35:18,264
FELICIA: Yeah, it's far away.

1626
01:35:18,264 --> 01:35:19,818
SAM: You mean your magic glasses.

1627
01:35:19,818 --> 01:35:21,287
LAURA: My magic glasses of seeing.

1628
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:22,219
MATT: Indeed.

1629
01:35:22,219 --> 01:35:25,146
SAM: This is so exciting!

1630
01:35:25,146 --> 01:35:26,975
MATT: All righty. So.

1631
01:35:27,131 --> 01:35:31,134
SAM: Mary and Felicia don't know. This is fun,
come on.

1632
01:35:31,134 --> 01:35:32,369
FELICIA: Thank you.

1633
01:35:32,369 --> 01:35:34,153
MARY: This is amazing, guys.

1634
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,627
TALIESIN: It's okay.

1635
01:35:35,627 --> 01:35:38,677
MATT: Cool. So. Initiative rolls for everyone--

1636
01:35:38,677 --> 01:35:39,904
TALIESIN: Blind Matt Mercer.

1637
01:35:39,904 --> 01:35:45,127
MATT: There will be a mild surprise round here
except for Grog, but we have initiatives from

1638
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:46,569
here. Percy, what you got?

1639
01:35:46,569 --> 01:35:47,597
TALIESIN: 16.

1640
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:50,432
MATT: 16 for Percy. Felicia?

1641
01:35:50,432 --> 01:35:51,455
FELICIA: Four!

1642
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,175
(laughter)

1643
01:35:53,175 --> 01:35:54,329
TALIESIN: Whoa!

1644
01:35:54,329 --> 01:35:55,638
FELICIA: Thank you, Thank you.

1645
01:35:55,638 --> 01:35:57,126
SAM: Eight!

1646
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:58,368
MATT: Okay, Lyra and Scanlan.

1647
01:35:58,368 --> 01:35:59,881
LAURA: Eight.

1648
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:00,989
TRAVIS: Holy crap.

1649
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:02,059
LAURA: Yep.

1650
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:03,059
MARY: Five.

1651
01:36:03,059 --> 01:36:04,803
LAURA: Oh God. Why did we all roll terribly.

1652
01:36:04,803 --> 01:36:06,299
MATT: You guys. (laughs)

1653
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:08,204
TRAVIS: We'll be dead. We'll be dead before we
leave.

1654
01:36:08,204 --> 01:36:11,682
MATT: Oh this is wonderful, you're all going to
die.

1655
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:15,291
SAM: You're all going to die, man!

1656
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:17,187
TALIESIN: That's never a good sign.

1657
01:36:17,187 --> 01:36:19,027
LAURA: I should have grabbed some of that dessert
that's here.

1658
01:36:19,027 --> 01:36:19,883
TRAVIS: 16.

1659
01:36:19,883 --> 01:36:22,572
MATT: Percy, you were 16 as well?

1660
01:36:22,572 --> 01:36:23,566
TALIESIN: 16.

1661
01:36:23,566 --> 01:36:25,909
SAM: I just had a couple. They're great, and I'm
sure Liam could get us some more.

1662
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:27,425
MARY: Maybe your brother--

1663
01:36:27,425 --> 01:36:31,336
MATT: All right. So. In this regard, Grog.

1664
01:36:31,336 --> 01:36:32,223
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1665
01:36:32,223 --> 01:36:35,812
MATT: You are actually going first. Everyone else,
you're currently in the process of waking up so

1666
01:36:35,812 --> 01:36:37,907
there's going to be a round before it gets to the
rest of you.

1667
01:36:37,907 --> 01:36:39,171
LAURA: Trinket! Wake up!

1668
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:42,178
MATT: Trinket wakes up. Grog.

1669
01:36:42,178 --> 01:36:43,155
TRAVIS: Eh?

1670
01:36:43,155 --> 01:36:46,604
MATT: You look, and you see the big, dire
wolf-like creature is currently staring at you

1671
01:36:46,604 --> 01:36:51,039
across the way, and you see other entities,
humanoid, coming towards you. As your Darkvision

1672
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:56,697
allows you to take up their features you can see
these are very heavily fur covered, dense leather

1673
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:05,052
armor protected, roving band of straight up orcs
that are currently converging on the campsite from

1674
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:07,755
the center of the woods. What are you going to
do?

1675
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:13,216
TRAVIS: You look like someone I just saw recently.
I would like to Rage, and I will charge the dire

1676
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,559
wolf puppy-thing and swing at its head with my
great-axe.

1677
01:37:16,559 --> 01:37:22,152
MATT: All right. So you immediately go into a
Grog-style charge. You guys can hear Grog yelling

1678
01:37:22,152 --> 01:37:26,668
in furious anger, echoing through the nearby wood
in the direction you heard his initial shout that

1679
01:37:26,668 --> 01:37:32,038
woke you up. Grog, you rush forward towards the
dire wolf. Go ahead and make your two attacks.

1680
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:34,069
TRAVIS: 26.

1681
01:37:34,069 --> 01:37:35,784
MATT: That hits.

1682
01:37:35,784 --> 01:37:38,229
TRAVIS: Ah! 25.

1683
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:39,579
MATT: Both hit!

1684
01:37:39,579 --> 01:37:40,671
TRAVIS: That was really good.

1685
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:42,499
MATT: Nice. Go ahead and roll some damage.

1686
01:37:42,499 --> 01:37:46,597
TRAVIS: Thank you. Ten and 18, is 28.

1687
01:37:46,597 --> 01:37:51,399
MATT: Great. So as you rush forward, your axe
hits into the side of the dire wolf.

1688
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:56,659
Slamming into its shoulder, you can see as you
draw the axe out of the wound, you've left a nice

1689
01:37:56,659 --> 01:38:02,009
hearty gash into the muscle tissue that holds its
arm to its shoulder. The other one, as you bring

1690
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:05,845
your axe around the other side it slams into the
upper part of its back. It sinks a good three or

1691
01:38:05,845 --> 01:38:10,602
four inches into it and the dire wolf (rrgaaah)
just reacts to the pain with a guttural screech

1692
01:38:10,602 --> 01:38:16,648
and then looks up at you, releasing its lips apart
for these nasty looking, sharp, long dire wolf

1693
01:38:16,648 --> 01:38:21,974
fangs revealed as it prepares itself to pounce
back. That ends your turn?

1694
01:38:21,974 --> 01:38:22,977
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1695
01:38:22,977 --> 01:38:28,787
MATT: As part of this round, the dire wolf is
going to return, as the two nearest orcs charge in

1696
01:38:28,787 --> 01:38:31,112
to flank Grog.

1697
01:38:31,112 --> 01:38:32,374
MARY: Oh no.

1698
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:37,245
MATT: This guy is going to move... One, two,
three... six... can't quite-- there. Is going to

1699
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:43,003
use its action to dash in here and loom over. So
as you're waking up you see this orc come

1700
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:44,171
lumbering around one of the trees--

1701
01:38:44,171 --> 01:38:45,072
FELICIA: (gasps)

1702
01:38:45,072 --> 01:38:46,440
SAM: Oh no! You? You're eating!

1703
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,101
MATT: -- with this giant club and just
gets in front of you. As you're freaking out,

1704
01:38:49,101 --> 01:38:51,539
another one flanks around and comes up towards
Percy.

1705
01:38:51,539 --> 01:38:53,564
TALIESIN: Hm!

1706
01:38:53,564 --> 01:38:59,652
MATT: Another one rushes up behind Scanlan there.
And you see, behind-- another growl and a series

1707
01:38:59,652 --> 01:39:05,273
of heavy footfalls as-- not quite an ogre, not
quite an orc; like some sort-of ogre/orc

1708
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:09,078
crossbreed, comes walking behind one of the other
trees to go up behind Percy on that side

1709
01:39:09,078 --> 01:39:10,125
LAURA: Oh God!

1710
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,105
SAM: Oh my Grog.

1711
01:39:11,105 --> 01:39:12,017
FELICIA: Oh no!

1712
01:39:12,017 --> 01:39:13,066
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh my Grog.

1713
01:39:13,066 --> 01:39:18,176
MATT: And from the far end over here another orc
moves forward one, two, three, four, five... six--

1714
01:39:18,176 --> 01:39:22,078
And he's going to use his action to finish his
movement here on Percy, as well.

1715
01:39:22,078 --> 01:39:23,430
TALIESIN: Oh God!

1716
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:25,059
LAURA: Are they attacking Percy?

1717
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:34,440
MATT: Yes. Currently there's only two attacks on
you from this ogre-like creature and this orc. Oh,

1718
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:40,518
that's not going to be very good. That would be a
nine?

1719
01:39:40,518 --> 01:39:41,427
TALIESIN: No.

1720
01:39:41,427 --> 01:39:42,708
MATT: What's your AC?

1721
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:43,802
TALIESIN: 18.

1722
01:39:43,802 --> 01:39:47,594
MATT: 18, that is not going to hit. And then we
also have-- that'll be a 22.

1723
01:39:47,594 --> 01:39:48,817
TALIESIN: That's going to hit.

1724
01:39:48,817 --> 01:39:55,666
MATT: All right, so the giant ogre-ish type
creature comes rushing towards you. Swings with

1725
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:59,947
its giant club and slams the ground next you as
you manage to roll out of the way and get up to

1726
01:39:59,947 --> 01:40:05,440
your feet, and as you do the orc to the other side
swings with what looks like a heavy axe and it

1727
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:10,623
nicks you in the side of the shoulder blade,
dealing 12 points of slashing damage.

1728
01:40:10,623 --> 01:40:12,207
TALIESIN: Hm!

1729
01:40:12,207 --> 01:40:19,588
MATT: We have-- this guy just barely gets to
Scanlan. Scanlan, as you're standing up one of the

1730
01:40:19,588 --> 01:40:22,804
orcs rushes up behind and you see he's holding
another large, double-handed great axe--

1731
01:40:22,804 --> 01:40:34,155
SAM: I sing-- (sings) No I don't want to get hurt,
by you. Doo doo doo doo.

1732
01:40:34,155 --> 01:40:40,201
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll the d10 to
reduce the attack modifier on that one.

1733
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,324
TRAVIS: (laughs) Where does this come from?

1734
01:40:42,324 --> 01:40:45,210
MATT: Rolled a 24 by the way.

1735
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,746
SAM: Okay, so I reduce that by two.

1736
01:40:47,746 --> 01:40:49,148
MATT: 22.

1737
01:40:49,148 --> 01:40:53,741
SAM: Yes, so he'll still hit, but he got a song
out of it.

1738
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:56,555
TRAVIS: (laughs) Lucky bastard.

1739
01:40:56,555 --> 01:41:03,703
MATT: Well there you go. All right, that will come
to another 12 points of slashing damage. As the

1740
01:41:03,703 --> 01:41:08,419
axe swings down, you manage to just pull out of
the way so it hits the armor and deflects, but it

1741
01:41:08,419 --> 01:41:13,673
leaves a huge gash in the front of the armor and
just the sheer weight of it kind of shook you for

1742
01:41:13,673 --> 01:41:14,930
a second.

1743
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:16,177
SAM: Ahh!

1744
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:21,388
MATT: That'll bring us to Grog, who is currently
being heavily flanked. First the dire wolf is

1745
01:41:21,388 --> 01:41:27,498
going to snatch at you because it's not happy with
your series of attacks, and with Pack Tactics it

1746
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:35,419
has advantage because it's within five feet of
other allies. So, its bite attack against you with

1747
01:41:35,419 --> 01:41:37,562
advantage is a-- natural 20.

1748
01:41:37,562 --> 01:41:38,673
LAURA: Oh no.

1749
01:41:38,673 --> 01:41:39,952
FELICIA: Oh no.

1750
01:41:39,952 --> 01:41:43,022
MATT: Using my new Critical Role dice.

1751
01:41:43,022 --> 01:41:44,587
LAURA: We're all going to die.

1752
01:41:44,587 --> 01:41:46,377
TALIESIN: Thanks chatroom. Thank you.

1753
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:48,204
FELICIA: Yes, chatroom.

1754
01:41:48,204 --> 01:41:53,207
MATT: It's 21 points of piercing damage from the
jaws which is reduced

1755
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:54,607
by half because of your Rage.

1756
01:41:54,607 --> 01:41:55,968
TRAVIS: Yes, so 11?

1757
01:41:55,968 --> 01:42:01,718
MATT: Yep. That finishes the dire wolf's turn. The
two other orcs are also going to swing at you from

1758
01:42:01,718 --> 01:42:07,173
the sides. They have advantage because they're
flanking you. That's going to be a 17.

1759
01:42:07,173 --> 01:42:08,433
TRAVIS: Misses.

1760
01:42:08,433 --> 01:42:13,676
MATT: And then with advantage on that one: 16.
Also misses. They're just swinging

1761
01:42:13,676 --> 01:42:20,824
at you with no effect. That completes the surprise
round. The orcs have pounced onto your campsite.

1762
01:42:20,824 --> 01:42:23,783
Back at the top of the order we have Percy. What
are you doing first?

1763
01:42:23,783 --> 01:42:33,187
TALIESIN: Going to cry a little. So,
I have three orcs basically-- or two orcs and a

1764
01:42:33,187 --> 01:42:34,731
god-knows-what?

1765
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:40,512
MATT: Yeah, it's too small to be an ogre but it's
too big to be an orc. A very unholy union of the

1766
01:42:40,512 --> 01:42:43,320
two probably created this spawn.

1767
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:50,960
TALIESIN: The first thing I'm going to do, is I'm
going to take a Fire Shot to the right to that

1768
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:57,193
giant monstrosity and spend a Grit point to try to
shoot him in the foot.

1769
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:58,437
MATT: Okay.

1770
01:42:58,437 --> 01:43:04,461
TALIESIN: -- makes a constitution saving throw.
Okay, these rules are new, so pardon me if I'm a

1771
01:43:04,461 --> 01:43:16,004
little iffy. So shot with Pepperbox is-- wow,
what's wrong with me? 28 to hit.

1772
01:43:16,004 --> 01:43:20,846
MATT: 28 definitely hits. He has to make a saving
throw or be knocked prone?

1773
01:43:20,846 --> 01:43:23,663
TALIESIN: Well yeah, there's damage plus a saving
throw.

1774
01:43:23,663 --> 01:43:28,096
He has to make a constitution saving throw.

1775
01:43:28,096 --> 01:43:29,781
MATT: All right.

1776
01:43:29,781 --> 01:43:34,319
TALIESIN: Eight plus my proficiency modifier plus
my dexterity modifier.

1777
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:36,236
MATT: Four plus six, so it would be 18?

1778
01:43:36,236 --> 01:43:42,832
TALIESIN: It's actually ten. 18, yeah, you're
right.

1779
01:43:42,832 --> 01:43:46,944
MATT: Yeah, he does not make that. So you shoot,
he gets knocked prone. As you shoot

1780
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,643
his foot out from under him, he stumbles to one
knee and then you just kick out and push him onto

1781
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:53,506
his back. That's the first shot.

1782
01:43:53,506 --> 01:43:59,590
TALIESIN: And it does six points of damage-- I'm
sorry, it does 12 points of damage plus three

1783
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:01,021
points of fire damage.

1784
01:44:01,021 --> 01:44:02,398
MATT: Nice.

1785
01:44:02,398 --> 01:44:15,032
TALIESIN: And now my other shot. Marking that off.
I'm going to shoot him while he's down.

1786
01:44:15,032 --> 01:44:16,395
MATT: Okay.

1787
01:44:16,395 --> 01:44:18,198
TALIESIN: So, do I get a bonus to hit there?

1788
01:44:18,198 --> 01:44:19,640
MATT: You have advantage because he's prone.

1789
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,155
TALIESIN: Okay, I get advantage. So I'm actually
using--

1790
01:44:21,155 --> 01:44:23,640
MATT: He's right there in front of you and he's
not able to really dodge effectively, so I'm going

1791
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,944
to give you advantage on this attack.

1792
01:44:24,944 --> 01:44:26,291
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm using Sharpshooter then.

1793
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:27,653
TRAVIS: Get him Percy!

1794
01:44:27,653 --> 01:44:34,792
TALIESIN: Thank God. Natural 20! So, this is going
to suck for him!

1795
01:44:34,836 --> 01:44:37,096
MATT: Which regenerates your Grit point you just
used, by the way.

1796
01:44:37,096 --> 01:44:38,823
TALIESIN: Does it? I'm back to three?

1797
01:44:38,823 --> 01:44:40,440
MATT: You get a Grit point whenever you crit.

1798
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:47,836
TALIESIN: Every time I crit, that's right!
Math! Okay, so I get double points

1799
01:44:47,886 --> 01:44:49,562
right? That's how this--

1800
01:44:49,562 --> 01:44:51,989
MATT: Roll the dice and double the number you
get.

1801
01:44:51,989 --> 01:45:00,934
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh, that kind of sucks. Seven, 14,
24, 25... 30 points of damage.

1802
01:45:00,934 --> 01:45:03,868
(cheering)

1803
01:45:03,868 --> 01:45:07,409
MATT: While it's on the ground, it looks up at you
and snarls. You removed your boot from where you

1804
01:45:07,409 --> 01:45:12,324
kicked it down. You bring the gun down, aim it,
and give it a glare as you fire with the

1805
01:45:12,324 --> 01:45:18,337
Pepperbox. As you do, you blast part of its jaw
off and you see it-- You see blood

1806
01:45:18,337 --> 01:45:21,880
starting to trickle and pour down the front of its
chest and it's trying to get up angrily, reaching

1807
01:45:21,939 --> 01:45:27,649
for its club which is currently in the half snow
floor of this forest interior. It's looking pretty

1808
01:45:27,649 --> 01:45:30,356
rough, but it's looking very intent on getting
vengeance on you.

1809
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:33,588
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity, if I try to make
a break for it they would get two attacks of

1810
01:45:33,588 --> 01:45:34,949
opportunity against me, right?

1811
01:45:34,949 --> 01:45:37,171
MATT: Yes. Yes, they are harrying you pretty
heavily right now.

1812
01:45:37,171 --> 01:45:41,983
TALIESIN: Ooh, that doesn't make my life any
better does it. No, never mind then.

1813
01:45:41,983 --> 01:45:48,654
TRAVIS: Do it, Percy!

1814
01:45:48,654 --> 01:45:52,000
TALIESIN: Actually, you know what? I'm pulling an
Action Surge. Two more shots.

1815
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,308
MATT: Go for it.

1816
01:45:53,308 --> 01:45:55,020
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him two more times while
he's on the ground.

1817
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:56,083
MATT: All right.

1818
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57,784
TALIESIN: Same thing with a plus ten to hit with a
Sharpshooter.

1819
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:58,923
MATT: Yep. He still has--

1820
01:45:58,923 --> 01:46:00,056
TALIESIN: Disadvantage?

1821
01:46:00,056 --> 01:46:01,805
MATT: Advantage to your shot because he's still on
the ground.

1822
01:46:01,805 --> 01:46:04,578
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

1823
01:46:04,578 --> 01:46:06,706
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

1824
01:46:06,706 --> 01:46:15,816
TALIESIN: Let's see. Sorry, trying to do this...
five plus 16, so 21 points of damage.

1825
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:21,183
MATT: 21 points of damage. All right, with that
shot as it's getting up and reaches for its club,

1826
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:25,607
it gets hold of it and starts bringing it in an
arc towards you. You lower the gun again, this

1827
01:46:25,656 --> 01:46:30,620
time shooting for the other side of its face.
With an echoing blasting sound you see the

1828
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:35,533
remainder of its lower jaw and head just blown out
the back of it. Its eyes roll back.

1829
01:46:35,533 --> 01:46:37,184
(cheering)

1830
01:46:37,328 --> 01:46:40,471
LAURA: Instakill!

1831
01:46:40,471 --> 01:46:42,113
TRAVIS: Damn! One turn!

1832
01:46:42,113 --> 01:46:46,172
TALIESIN: And now, I'm going to take that last
shot and swing up and shoot at the one that's to

1833
01:46:46,172 --> 01:46:48,201
the right of--

1834
01:46:48,201 --> 01:46:49,221
MATT: This one?

1835
01:46:49,221 --> 01:46:50,495
TALIESIN: That one right there.

1836
01:46:50,495 --> 01:46:52,246
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.

1837
01:46:52,246 --> 01:46:54,091
TALIESIN: Oh, God. Natural 20!

1838
01:46:54,091 --> 01:46:55,303
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

1839
01:46:55,303 --> 01:46:56,719
FELICIA: What the heck?

1840
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,893
LAURA: This is the best night for Percy, ever.

1841
01:46:58,893 --> 01:47:04,645
TALIESIN: I'm just sitting in the corner going
(maniacal laughter)

1842
01:47:04,704 --> 01:47:08,441
TRAVIS: You were sleeping. Are you doing all this
naked, since you were woken up so quickly?

1843
01:47:08,441 --> 01:47:09,561
LAURA: Yes, definitely.

1844
01:47:09,561 --> 01:47:12,687
TALIESIN: I'm in the pajamas with the butt flap,
and the butt flap is down.

1845
01:47:12,687 --> 01:47:13,569
MARY: Yes!

1846
01:47:13,569 --> 01:47:15,019
TALIESIN: The butt flap is down!

1847
01:47:15,019 --> 01:47:16,026
TRAVIS: I applaud.

1848
01:47:16,026 --> 01:47:19,257
MATT: All right. Good to know, because that will
affect your armor class.

1849
01:47:19,257 --> 01:47:24,803
TALIESIN: And that's eight, 16, 26, 27, 28, 29,
31, 32 points of damage.

1850
01:47:24,803 --> 01:47:26,715
MATT: 32 points of damage.

1851
01:47:26,715 --> 01:47:27,837
TRAVIS: What the what?

1852
01:47:27,837 --> 01:47:28,962
LAURA: That's insane.

1853
01:47:28,962 --> 01:47:30,306
TALIESIN: It's a crit.

1854
01:47:30,306 --> 01:47:34,157
LAURA: Can we all get inspiration from seeing
Percy just massacre?

1855
01:47:34,348 --> 01:47:36,302
FELICIA: It's like a John Woo film right now.

1856
01:47:36,302 --> 01:47:38,205
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? With the doves--

1857
01:47:38,205 --> 01:47:41,234
MATT: You all are a little distracted by the other
ones that are currently pushing in. You hear the

1858
01:47:41,234 --> 01:47:46,206
explosions and you see off to the corner, but you
have too many things around you right now. Okay,

1859
01:47:46,206 --> 01:47:50,359
so as you pull back the gun, the orc that's in
front of you that's currently holding its one

1860
01:47:50,359 --> 01:47:55,059
handed axe with two hands is rearing back. You
fire right towards its face. It tries to duck out

1861
01:47:55,059 --> 01:47:58,604
of the way and you smack into its shoulder. With
an explosion you can see its leather armor

1862
01:47:58,604 --> 01:48:03,941
splinters, and its fur kind of burns and curls
back from the flame of the blast, and beneath you

1863
01:48:04,004 --> 01:48:09,358
can see that most of the muscle tissue and exposed
bone is visible as you've blown a giant crater in

1864
01:48:09,358 --> 01:48:11,096
its shoulder.

1865
01:48:11,096 --> 01:48:12,701
LAURA: Gross!

1866
01:48:12,701 --> 01:48:15,681
TALIESIN: That was brilliant. I'm done. Sorry.

1867
01:48:15,681 --> 01:48:16,930
MATT: Grog, you're up.

1868
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:20,742
TRAVIS: I'm up. I would like to go into a Frenzied
Rage now that I've got all my playmates around me.

1869
01:48:20,742 --> 01:48:25,365
And I would like to take one giant swing in a half
circle, trying to get all three at one time.

1870
01:48:25,365 --> 01:48:27,237
MATT: All right, so attack for each one. Go for it.

1871
01:48:27,237 --> 01:48:29,761
TRAVIS: So that's a 22.

1872
01:48:29,761 --> 01:48:31,625
MATT: That hits the orc. Dire wolf.

1873
01:48:31,625 --> 01:48:33,570
TRAVIS: That's a 23.

1874
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:35,585
MATT: Hits. And for the last orc.

1875
01:48:35,585 --> 01:48:36,842
LAURA: Hell yeah.

1876
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:38,607
TRAVIS: 26. 25!

1877
01:48:38,607 --> 01:48:42,042
MATT: Okay, roll damage three times, and it's in
order. This orc over here?

1878
01:48:42,042 --> 01:48:48,989
TRAVIS: 15. 12. And 17.

1879
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:58,508
MATT: All right. As you (whoosh) swing the axe
around, it clips across the chest of the orc who

1880
01:48:58,508 --> 01:49:04,367
is almost pushed off his feet from the sheer
force. The axe swings, slams into the front

1881
01:49:04,425 --> 01:49:09,087
throat, chest area of the dire wolf with so much
force that it cuts clean through leaving this open

1882
01:49:09,135 --> 01:49:12,581
wound where its main veins just begin to pour its
lifeblood.

1883
01:49:12,581 --> 01:49:13,530
FELICIA: Ew.

1884
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:17,849
MATT: The dire wolf just gurgles for a
second before slumping onto the ground, motionless.

1885
01:49:17,893 --> 01:49:22,214
With the inertia carrying through its body
it slams into the other orc, who actually has a

1886
01:49:22,214 --> 01:49:28,109
small buckler shield that manages to catch. It
shatters most of the leather and metal that

1887
01:49:28,109 --> 01:49:32,911
encompasses the piece, getting stuck into his
forearm and he yells in your face

1888
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:36,053
with this kind of guttural shout and he pulls his
own arm off the blade of the axe

1889
01:49:36,053 --> 01:49:37,231
as you withdraw it.

1890
01:49:37,231 --> 01:49:38,393
TRAVIS: Ooh.

1891
01:49:38,393 --> 01:49:43,454
MATT: That concludes your turn. It's now their
turn. All you low initiative rolling motherfuckers

1892
01:49:43,454 --> 01:49:44,570
got to wait!

1893
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:45,783
(laughter)

1894
01:49:45,783 --> 01:49:47,924
MARY: (sings) Mother! Motherfucker!

1895
01:49:47,924 --> 01:50:00,591
MATT: Let's see. First and foremost, the two guys
that are-- in that motion, the two orcs that you

1896
01:50:00,591 --> 01:50:06,455
just slammed rear back and then retaliate very
heavily against you. They both have advantage

1897
01:50:06,609 --> 01:50:09,882
because they have you flanked. That'll be 22.

1898
01:50:09,882 --> 01:50:11,347
TRAVIS: Hits.

1899
01:50:11,403 --> 01:50:13,450
MATT: And a 14.

1900
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:14,450
TRAVIS: Misses.

1901
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:19,265
MATT: Yes. All right. So the one with the buckler
and what looks like a longsword strikes you for

1902
01:50:19,265 --> 01:50:22,457
eight points of slashing damage, of which you take
four.

1903
01:50:22,457 --> 01:50:23,481
TRAVIS: Great.

1904
01:50:23,481 --> 01:50:29,496
MATT: That ends their turn. The one orc that's
overtop of you, Lyra, goes (rggh!) and swings

1905
01:50:29,496 --> 01:50:34,943
in a wide arc down towards you. 
That's going to be a 14.

1906
01:50:35,099 --> 01:50:36,736
FELICIA: I have a 13.

1907
01:50:36,736 --> 01:50:46,333
MATT: Aw, okay. So, as its two handed axe swings
down on top of you, you take six points of

1908
01:50:46,333 --> 01:50:47,431
slashing damage.

1909
01:50:47,431 --> 01:50:48,463
FELICIA: Ouch!

1910
01:50:48,463 --> 01:50:51,831
MATT: You instinctively freak out and back up out
of the way and it actually doesn't hit you, it

1911
01:50:51,831 --> 01:50:56,718
slams into your bedroll. But the sheer impact
shakes you and you can feel the sweat beginning to

1912
01:50:56,718 --> 01:51:06,242
pour from your forehead. That's going to bring us
to this guy here, who's attacking Scanlan. That's

1913
01:51:06,242 --> 01:51:08,086
going to be a 12.

1914
01:51:08,086 --> 01:51:09,281
SAM: Miss!

1915
01:51:09,281 --> 01:51:13,596
MATT: He swings towards your head. Thankfully he's
not used to attacking things so small. You duck

1916
01:51:13,596 --> 01:51:15,167
quickly out of the way.

1917
01:51:15,167 --> 01:51:16,481
SAM: Fuck you!

1918
01:51:16,481 --> 01:51:18,276
(laughter)

1919
01:51:18,276 --> 01:51:23,442
MATT: And that's-- Oh, and the two on Percy, who
are now looking for retribution. They're looking

1920
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:26,036
a little shaken by the whole experience. The one
that you shot in the shoulder too.

1921
01:51:26,036 --> 01:51:31,243
TALIESIN: I'm just screaming in their face like a
manic pixie. (screams)

1922
01:51:31,243 --> 01:51:33,468
FELICIA: Manic pixie dream gunslinger.

1923
01:51:33,468 --> 01:51:34,521
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1924
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:35,997
MATT: That'll be a 20.

1925
01:51:35,997 --> 01:51:36,948
TALIESIN: I walked into that.

1926
01:51:36,948 --> 01:51:37,878
MATT: 20 to hit.

1927
01:51:37,878 --> 01:51:41,528
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a Grit point and--
Wait, if my armor class is 20, does that mean they

1928
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:42,933
still hit?

1929
01:51:42,933 --> 01:51:45,312
MATT: I thought you were wearing your pajamas with
the butt flap?

1930
01:51:45,312 --> 01:51:47,015
ALL: Oh!

1931
01:51:47,015 --> 01:51:48,220
SAM: Details, details.

1932
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,607
LAURA:That's so mean.

1933
01:51:49,607 --> 01:51:53,581
TALIESIN: One day, far in the future, I'll figure
out a way to make you pay for that.

1934
01:51:53,581 --> 01:51:55,346
(laughter)

1935
01:51:55,346 --> 01:51:56,954
TALIESIN: For now, fine. That hits.

1936
01:51:56,954 --> 01:51:59,888
MATT: Sometimes you-- This is what I heard.

1937
01:51:59,888 --> 01:52:01,686
TALIESIN: Damn it.

1938
01:52:01,686 --> 01:52:03,605
TRAVIS: The visualization was worth it alone.

1939
01:52:03,605 --> 01:52:05,622
MATT: And 22 for the second attack.

1940
01:52:05,622 --> 01:52:06,592
TALIESIN: That hits.

1941
01:52:06,592 --> 01:52:09,603
MATT: So both of them strike at once. You don't
quite know which way to dodge, and as you try to

1942
01:52:09,603 --> 01:52:13,070
duck out of the way both blades hit you
simultaneously on the sides.

1943
01:52:13,117 --> 01:52:14,276
LAURA: Oh no!

1944
01:52:14,276 --> 01:52:17,962
MATT: You take four points of damage from one.
Rolled really low.

1945
01:52:17,962 --> 01:52:20,554
That one rolled pretty high, you take 12.

1946
01:52:20,612 --> 01:52:21,663
TALIESIN: 12 total?

1947
01:52:21,663 --> 01:52:22,795
MATT: The total would be 16.

1948
01:52:22,795 --> 01:52:23,803
TALIESIN: Okay, 16.

1949
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:27,991
MATT: You take 16 points of slashing damage from
the two of those orcs. Now we come to Scanlan.

1950
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:33,349
SAM: Okay, I turn to the orc who just missed me
and I cast Dominate Person.

1951
01:52:33,349 --> 01:52:34,426
TRAVIS: Yes!

1952
01:52:34,426 --> 01:52:38,416
SAM: With my-- through my Hand Cone of Clarity, of
course.

1953
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:46,650
MATT: All right. So, as you finish your casting of
the spell you can see the anger in its face

1954
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:50,960
suddenly drop and subside, and it gives you this
expectant look.

1955
01:52:50,960 --> 01:53:02,425
SAM: I command him to protect our goliath, with
his life if he needs to,

1956
01:53:02,425 --> 01:53:05,077
and retreat from me instantly.

1957
01:53:05,077 --> 01:53:10,156
MATT: Okay. It nods and looks over
towards where Grog is and with this kind of slack

1958
01:53:10,156 --> 01:53:15,045
jawed expression turns and looks like it's ready
to make its way towards Grog next round. Do you

1959
01:53:15,045 --> 01:53:17,376
want to move at all? Or are you staying here?

1960
01:53:17,376 --> 01:53:20,057
SAM: I will move a step towards Lyra.

1961
01:53:20,057 --> 01:53:23,160
MATT: All right. Yeah, he's not currently
threatening you because he is controlled by you.

1962
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:26,672
So you step back with the fire to your
back, you can feel the heat flickering behind you.

1963
01:53:26,718 --> 01:53:31,285
SAM: And I will just be backup for her, and I also
will inspire her.

1964
01:53:31,331 --> 01:53:32,700
MATT: All right.

1965
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:41,635
SAM: With a little-- I turn to her, and I start
singing. (sings) And I raise my hand to Lyra and

1966
01:53:41,635 --> 01:53:54,091
say that you could use some Scanlan today.
Tonight I give you a d10.

1967
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:57,067
(laughter)

1968
01:53:57,067 --> 01:54:01,850
MATT: So with that you have a d10 inspiration dice
that you can add to any d20 roll you need to make.

1969
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:03,517
It could be an attack, could be a saving throw.

1970
01:54:03,517 --> 01:54:05,640
FELICIA: Okay, great. Thank you.

1971
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:07,707
MATT: You can roll and if that's not enough, you
can add a d10 to it.

1972
01:54:07,707 --> 01:54:09,189
FELICIA: Okay, great. That's so nice.

1973
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:12,750
MATT: So that ends Scanlan's turn. Vex, you're
up.

1974
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:17,357
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast-- How many people are
on Percy?

1975
01:54:17,402 --> 01:54:19,008
MATT: Two currently, flanking him right there.

1976
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:22,736
LAURA: I'm going to do Hunter's Mark on the
damaged one.

1977
01:54:22,736 --> 01:54:24,127
MATT: Okay.

1978
01:54:24,127 --> 01:54:26,619
LAURA: Should I get-- Yeah, the one that's
damaged.

1979
01:54:26,619 --> 01:54:30,045
MATT: The one that's damaged the most is going to
be this one.

1980
01:54:30,045 --> 01:54:31,669
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the one.

1981
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:38,462
LAURA: Yeah! And I'm going to shoot him.

1982
01:54:38,598 --> 01:54:44,498
Through my-- I'm going to shoot him through
my Flaming Bow.

1983
01:54:44,498 --> 01:54:45,610
MATT: All right.

1984
01:54:45,610 --> 01:54:51,463
LAURA: And I also am going to have Trinket attack
him twice. How about that?

1985
01:54:51,463 --> 01:54:52,810
MATT: You can do that.

1986
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:53,776
LAURA: All right.

1987
01:54:53,776 --> 01:54:56,214
MATT: All right, so Trinket runs around the tree.

1988
01:54:56,272 --> 01:54:57,654
SAM: Never happened before.

1989
01:54:57,654 --> 01:55:03,753
MATT: An unexpected circumstance. So as you turn
around, you go ahead and you point at the orc to

1990
01:55:03,753 --> 01:55:10,683
the side with a flicker of slightly shimmering
white energy. You can see your attention focus and

1991
01:55:10,683 --> 01:55:14,700
clarity crystallize on this one orc who glances
over at you, returning the gaze.

1992
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:16,117
LAURA: 19 attack.

1993
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:19,598
MATT: 19 attack does hit. And as the arrow is
released from your bow--

1994
01:55:19,598 --> 01:55:20,920
LAURA: Yes.

1995
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:22,967
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

1996
01:55:22,967 --> 01:55:40,422
LAURA: Plus the d10 for the flaming. 17 to hit,
and then Trinket's attacks?

1997
01:55:40,422 --> 01:55:46,080
MATT: Yep. Roll twice for Trinket. As the arrow
(sploof) hits him on the chest area and (boom)

1998
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,853
bursts into flames, igniting part of his shoulder.
As he looks down you hear this guttural growl from

1999
01:55:50,853 --> 01:55:53,970
around the corner. As he glances over Trinket
comes jumping out of the shadows

2000
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:55,344
from behind the tree.

2001
01:55:55,344 --> 01:56:02,154
LAURA: Trinket! I never know what to look at
because I never attack with Trinket.

2002
01:56:02,154 --> 01:56:03,368
MATT: Attack bonus.

2003
01:56:03,368 --> 01:56:05,239
LAURA: Okay. That's 22 for one.

2004
01:56:05,239 --> 01:56:07,425
MATT: 22 hits. Roll for the second attack.

2005
01:56:07,425 --> 01:56:11,952
LAURA: The second one is a 16.

2006
01:56:11,952 --> 01:56:14,381
MATT: 16 just barely hits.

2007
01:56:14,381 --> 01:56:20,504
LAURA: Oh my goodness!

2008
01:56:20,558 --> 01:56:21,989
SAM: Trinket's doing something.

2009
01:56:22,035 --> 01:56:26,395
LAURA: I know! You guys! Does that mean he can
bite twice?

2010
01:56:26,395 --> 01:56:27,663
MATT: Yep.

2011
01:56:27,663 --> 01:56:33,919
LAURA: Okay, he's going to do that. Oh wait, no.
One is going to be bite

2012
01:56:33,919 --> 01:56:35,271
and one is going to be claws.

2013
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:36,573
SAM: And he dies.

2014
01:56:36,573 --> 01:56:39,760
LAURA: Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark on the
previous one. Four for Hunter's Mark.

2015
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,335
MATT: Four additional damage for Hunter's Mark.

2016
01:56:42,335 --> 01:56:53,883
LAURA: 13. No 12, for one attack. And then-- What
did I just do? I did it wrong. That was wrong.

2017
01:56:53,883 --> 01:56:55,659
TRAVIS: What?

2018
01:56:55,659 --> 01:56:59,458
LAURA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is 11 for the first
one.

2019
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:00,858
MATT: 11 for the first one. All right.

2020
01:57:00,858 --> 01:57:05,904
LAURA: And then the second one. This is so new and
exciting. And 12 for the second.

2021
01:57:05,904 --> 01:57:11,458
MATT: All right. So, as Trinket rushes around the
corner with one claw (whacks) hits him in the back

2022
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:15,519
of the shoulder sending him onto the ground. The
orc now, shoulder in flames, is on its back.

2023
01:57:15,519 --> 01:57:20,229
Trinket leaps on top, reaches down and with its
jaws around its head

2024
01:57:20,229 --> 01:57:22,452
just bites the head off.

2025
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:24,007
ALL: Ohh!

2026
01:57:24,007 --> 01:57:29,808
MATT: As you see the head flip into the air, 
catches the head in his jaws and

2027
01:57:29,808 --> 01:57:31,319
crunches down on it.

2028
01:57:31,504 --> 01:57:33,548
LAURA: Yes! Have a meal, buddy!

2029
01:57:33,548 --> 01:57:35,815
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you want to cuddle with that?

2030
01:57:35,815 --> 01:57:37,281
LAURA: Hell yeah I do!

2031
01:57:37,281 --> 01:57:39,037
MATT: Zahra, it's your go.

2032
01:57:39,037 --> 01:57:42,327
MARY: All right. Is that an orc right behind me?

2033
01:57:42,327 --> 01:57:44,693
MATT: This is Vex right there.

2034
01:57:44,693 --> 01:57:46,094
LAURA: That's me.

2035
01:57:46,094 --> 01:57:47,645
MARY: No, I can't see where I am.

2036
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:49,208
MATT: You're right here.

2037
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:52,199
MARY: Okay. Who are the three strongest orcs right
now?

2038
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:57,577
MATT: This one and these two here all look pretty
untouched. This one is actually untouched. Four.

2039
01:57:57,577 --> 01:57:59,533
One, two, three, four.

2040
01:57:59,533 --> 01:58:02,623
MARY: And I can only Hex one creature, is this
correct?

2041
01:58:02,696 --> 01:58:03,991
MATT: Correct.

2042
01:58:03,991 --> 01:58:10,532
MARY: All right. I'm going to Hex the one by-- in
the back, sorry. I'm going to Hex him.

2043
01:58:10,532 --> 01:58:12,099
MATT: Him? All right.

2044
01:58:12,099 --> 01:58:21,647
MARY: And I'm going to incant Agonizing Blast, and
cast Eldritch Blast on those three orcs.

2045
01:58:21,647 --> 01:58:23,244
SAM: I've never heard of any of these things.

2046
01:58:23,244 --> 01:58:25,432
MARY: Because there's three blasts that come from,
yeah?

2047
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:28,445
MATT: Well, Eldritch Blast is three different
beams, and that's just Eldritch Blast for your

2048
01:58:28,445 --> 01:58:30,534
turn. Or you can do Agonizing Blast, you choose
one or the other.

2049
01:58:30,534 --> 01:58:32,746
MARY: Oh, I thought Agonizing Blast was a--

2050
01:58:32,746 --> 01:58:34,212
LAURA: Cantrip?

2051
01:58:34,212 --> 01:58:35,644
MATT: Oh. It's one of your abilities?

2052
01:58:35,644 --> 01:58:36,550
MARY: Yes.

2053
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:37,804
MATT: Oh, it just improves the Eldritch Blast?

2054
01:58:37,804 --> 01:58:38,606
MARY: Yeah.

2055
01:58:38,606 --> 01:58:39,739
MATT: Oh yeah, you can totally do that.

2056
01:58:39,739 --> 01:58:40,768
MARY: I want to do that.

2057
01:58:40,768 --> 01:58:41,771
MATT: Okay, so you turn around--

2058
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:43,762
MARY: I'd like to do that with my Staff of
Dragons.

2059
01:58:43,762 --> 01:58:47,577
MATT: You hold the staff forward and for a second
your eyes, which are normally a vibrant bright

2060
01:58:47,577 --> 01:58:54,234
white suddenly close with this darkness and then
reveal a pale blue like the moon in the sky. As

2061
01:58:54,234 --> 01:59:00,397
you do, this hue of light blue energy begins to
emanate from this orc right there. He looks down

2062
01:59:00,397 --> 01:59:06,150
confused as you pull your staff up and slam the
ground with it. As you do, these three streaks of

2063
01:59:06,150 --> 01:59:09,182
pale, blueish green energy streak out towards it.

2064
01:59:09,182 --> 01:59:10,089
MARY: Ha!

2065
01:59:10,089 --> 01:59:12,043
MATT: Go ahead and roll three attacks.

2066
01:59:12,043 --> 01:59:13,321
MARY: Oh my god.

2067
01:59:13,321 --> 01:59:16,146
MATT: Adding your bonus-- your spell bonus to each
one.

2068
01:59:16,146 --> 01:59:18,764
MARY: 13 plus 11.

2069
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:20,488
LAURA: So 24.

2070
01:59:20,488 --> 01:59:21,548
MARY: 24.

2071
01:59:21,548 --> 01:59:22,856
MATT: That hits.

2072
01:59:22,856 --> 01:59:26,610
MARY: That was a good one. 30.

2073
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:28,150
MATT: 30. Okay.

2074
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:29,226
SAM: What?

2075
01:59:29,226 --> 01:59:30,692
MARY: And 21.

2076
01:59:30,692 --> 01:59:32,150
MATT: Are you adding the plus--

2077
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:34,292
MARY: Oh and plus two to each of them.

2078
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:35,946
LAURA: That's damage.

2079
01:59:35,946 --> 01:59:40,783
MARY: Oh, I'm sorry. So it's Eldritch Blast, it
gets plus 11.

2080
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:43,442
MATT: Right. So what was the last one?

2081
01:59:43,442 --> 01:59:44,991
MARY: 21.

2082
01:59:44,991 --> 01:59:49,118
MATT: They all hit, so go ahead and roll damage
for each, and each does additional Hex damage,

2083
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:51,005
because it's three different hits.

2084
01:59:51,005 --> 01:59:54,302
MARY: Yes. And the damage is 1d10 plus seven times
three?

2085
01:59:54,302 --> 01:59:57,040
SAM: Too much math.

2086
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,428
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll that three times.
1d10 plus seven, 1d10 plus seven,

2087
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,570
1d10 plus seven.

2088
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:03,370
MARY: Okay. Oh, help me.

2089
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:06,729
LAURA: That's not a d10, that's a d12.

2090
02:00:06,729 --> 02:00:08,037
MARY: Sorry. Sorry!

2091
02:00:08,037 --> 02:00:08,906
MATT: It's all right.

2092
02:00:08,906 --> 02:00:10,013
SAM: She's a guest.

2093
02:00:10,013 --> 02:00:11,588
MARY: I'm a guest.

2094
02:00:11,588 --> 02:00:14,335
LAURA: Oh, you know what, I was rolling eights
instead of tens. That's okay.

2095
02:00:14,498 --> 02:00:16,385
MATT: Too late now. Next time.

2096
02:00:16,385 --> 02:00:20,341
MARY: Two plus seven. Two plus seven is ten.

2097
02:00:20,486 --> 02:00:21,554
SAM: Nine. Nine.

2098
02:00:21,554 --> 02:00:22,682
MATT: All right.

2099
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:24,421
MARY: Two plus seven is nine, thank you.

2100
02:00:24,421 --> 02:00:25,483
LAURA: Ten.

2101
02:00:25,483 --> 02:00:27,207
MARY: Ten plus seven is 17.

2102
02:00:27,207 --> 02:00:28,181
MATT: All right.

2103
02:00:28,181 --> 02:00:31,219
MARY: And five plus seven is--

2104
02:00:31,219 --> 02:00:32,071
TRAVIS: 12.

2105
02:00:32,071 --> 02:00:32,875
MARY: 12.

2106
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:35,929
MATT: 12. And then then add-- roll a d6 three
times because each time you blast them you do the

2107
02:00:35,929 --> 02:00:37,585
additional Hex damage.

2108
02:00:37,585 --> 02:00:39,392
TRAVIS: Holy crap what are you?

2109
02:00:39,392 --> 02:00:40,506
MARY: Two.

2110
02:00:40,506 --> 02:00:41,595
MATT: All right two.

2111
02:00:41,595 --> 02:00:43,377
MARY: Six.

2112
02:00:43,377 --> 02:00:44,556
LAURA: Fuck.

2113
02:00:44,556 --> 02:00:45,787
MATT: Eight total.

2114
02:00:45,787 --> 02:00:46,722
MARY: Five.

2115
02:00:46,722 --> 02:00:47,570
TRAVIS: Whoa!

2116
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:48,772
MATT: 13.

2117
02:00:48,772 --> 02:00:50,469
LAURA: It's like a Hunter's Mark all on your
own.

2118
02:00:50,469 --> 02:00:56,835
MATT: So, after the beams streak out-- all three
blast simultaneously into the torso area of the

2119
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:00,597
orc that's standing by Percy. It's glaring at you
with this look of surprise, and fury, and

2120
02:01:00,597 --> 02:01:04,819
frustration and before it can even try and mount
any sort of attack, the three beams strike it in

2121
02:01:04,819 --> 02:01:12,943
the chest. You can see this scattering of brackish
liquid as the back of its torso is blown out like

2122
02:01:12,943 --> 02:01:14,197
a shotgun blast.

2123
02:01:14,197 --> 02:01:15,497
MARY: Yes!

2124
02:01:15,497 --> 02:01:20,632
MATT: And it falls to the ground with
this gurgle in its throat, and for a second you

2125
02:01:20,632 --> 02:01:27,542
swear you see the glistening moonlight colored
energy that you had Hexed upon it almost sucks the

2126
02:01:27,542 --> 02:01:31,392
soul from its body and then it dissipates into the
air above it.

2127
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:35,550
MARY: Thaumaturgy makes my eyes go fire.

2128
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:37,821
(laughter)

2129
02:01:37,821 --> 02:01:38,804
SAM: Wow.

2130
02:01:38,804 --> 02:01:45,882
MATT: A big blast of flame. Great. So that will
end your turn there.

2131
02:01:45,882 --> 02:01:47,811
TRAVIS: You did really well.

2132
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:49,331
LAURA: How is she so cool?

2133
02:01:49,331 --> 02:01:52,066
SAM: She just changed the game.

2134
02:01:52,066 --> 02:01:55,484
MATT: That will bring us to Lyra.

2135
02:01:55,484 --> 02:01:56,712
TRAVIS: She can stay.

2136
02:01:56,712 --> 02:01:58,413
FELICIA: Is that 30 feet?

2137
02:01:58,413 --> 02:02:03,203
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. 30 foot is right
there. From you.

2138
02:02:03,203 --> 02:02:05,978
FELICIA: Who are the bad guys? This one, this one,
and this one?

2139
02:02:05,978 --> 02:02:08,138
MATT: This one, this one, and these two there.

2140
02:02:08,138 --> 02:02:13,465
FELICIA: Okay. So I'm like-- (screams) Oh, that
was cool. Okay. (pff) And I use my Chain

2141
02:02:13,465 --> 02:02:22,914
Lightning. You have to do a save on that. That
just automatically hits.

2142
02:02:22,914 --> 02:02:24,296
MATT: That just hits, yeah.

2143
02:02:24,296 --> 02:02:25,910
FELICIA: Okay, so it's 10d8.

2144
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:26,901
SAM: To whom?

2145
02:02:26,901 --> 02:02:29,891
FELICIA: To one guy, and then it can hit up to
three people within 30 feet.

2146
02:02:29,891 --> 02:02:32,198
SAM: Are they within 30 feet?

2147
02:02:32,198 --> 02:02:34,456
MATT: These two are not but this guy is.

2148
02:02:34,456 --> 02:02:50,811
FELICIA: Ten, is 21. Plus 21 plus 24. 21 plus 24
is-

2149
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:51,959
SAM: 45.

2150
02:02:51,959 --> 02:02:54,789
FELICIA: 45 points of damage to that guy, and then
it goes to the other guy.

2151
02:02:54,789 --> 02:02:59,557
MATT: This guy there. These guys are a little
too far away, unfortunately. This guy is not.

2152
02:02:59,608 --> 02:03:01,075
FELICIA: Oh, okay. Get that guy.

2153
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:05,780
MATT: As you freak out you back up and as an
instinctual maneuver you put your fingers out, and

2154
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:14,963
there is a loud crackling sound as a condensed
thunderstorm blasts forth from Lyra's hands. The

2155
02:03:14,963 --> 02:03:20,640
orc that's threatening her and actually managed to
try and strike you gives you this look of sudden

2156
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:26,134
pity before its entire upper body is fried
instantly from the electricity that just

2157
02:03:26,134 --> 02:03:30,887
destroys-- You can see all its flesh is now curled
back and cracking from the sheer amount of energy

2158
02:03:30,887 --> 02:03:34,850
that's flowing through it. The bolt then streaks
off and slams the one that you dominated that was

2159
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:41,769
currently running in the other direction-- all of
a sudden gets hit in the side. However, maintains

2160
02:03:41,769 --> 02:03:43,093
the Domination.

2161
02:03:43,093 --> 02:03:44,674
(laughter)

2162
02:03:44,674 --> 02:03:48,930
MATT: He did take half damage to that one. But
this one is blown off the map. The other one over

2163
02:03:48,930 --> 02:03:52,916
here is looking pretty rough now. It's
hobbling forward currently with

2164
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:54,399
one of its legs ruined.

2165
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:57,515
LAURA: (laughs) That poor orc!

2166
02:03:57,515 --> 02:04:01,301
MATT: It's pretty rough. It's been a rough day for
him. Do you want to stay where you are or do you

2167
02:04:01,301 --> 02:04:02,851
want to move?

2168
02:04:02,851 --> 02:04:04,979
FELICIA: I'll stay where I am. Wow, that worked!

2169
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:06,371
SAM: Wow, that was amazing!

2170
02:04:06,371 --> 02:04:10,485
I turn around and sort of barf because I just
saw a guy's upper half get incinerated.

2171
02:04:10,533 --> 02:04:12,764
(laughter)

2172
02:04:12,764 --> 02:04:15,345
MARY: Suck it up, Scanlan.

2173
02:04:15,404 --> 02:04:17,932
MATT: All right. Top of the round. Percy, Grog.

2174
02:04:17,932 --> 02:04:23,021
TALIESIN: You first or I? I'm going to start
running towards Grog.

2175
02:04:23,021 --> 02:04:24,349
MATT: Okay.

2176
02:04:24,349 --> 02:04:30,308
TALIESIN: How far can I get? About that far. And
while I'm running I'm just going to take-- Oh

2177
02:04:30,308 --> 02:04:34,703
hello, where are we? There we are. I'm just going
to take two pot shots at him as I'm running by.

2178
02:04:34,703 --> 02:04:37,397
SAM: My dominated guy is not going to live to see
his--

2179
02:04:37,397 --> 02:04:42,718
TALIESIN: And just because I don't really care I'm
going to take the negative-- the Sharpshooter plus

2180
02:04:42,718 --> 02:04:44,767
damage negative to that. So.

2181
02:04:44,811 --> 02:04:46,238
MATT: Okay.

2182
02:04:46,238 --> 02:04:49,920
TALIESIN: 16.

2183
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:51,817
MATT: 16 does hit.

2184
02:04:51,817 --> 02:04:56,161
TALIESIN: And I'll just do both right now. And--

2185
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:58,393
FELICIA: Oh my god!

2186
02:04:58,393 --> 02:04:59,569
LAURA: Did you get another 20?

2187
02:04:59,569 --> 02:05:00,481
FELICIA: Yes!

2188
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:01,481
TALIESIN: I got another 20!

2189
02:05:01,481 --> 02:05:03,292
FELICIA: That's a very good dice. That's a very
good die.

2190
02:05:03,292 --> 02:05:05,427
TRAVIS: You can spread them out over several
games. You don't have to--

2191
02:05:05,427 --> 02:05:07,796
LAURA: We have to fight dragons soon. A dragon.

2192
02:05:07,796 --> 02:05:13,620
TALIESIN: Thank you. This is phenomenal, I know.
I've got such terrible things that are going to

2193
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:17,630
happen to me because of all this good luck. So
that's-- I'll do the first one really quickly.

2194
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:23,420
That's 20 points of damage for the first shot.

2195
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:27,431
TRAVIS: Leave none alive, my boy.

2196
02:05:27,431 --> 02:05:33,501
MATT: First shot smacks into its thigh, and you
can see where once there was an actual functional

2197
02:05:33,558 --> 02:05:41,806
thigh area is now a splintered femur that is
exposed through one side of his leg. You can see

2198
02:05:41,806 --> 02:05:46,865
it's barely keeping itself standing. It roars out
(raaah!) in pain as you fire again--

2199
02:05:46,865 --> 02:05:49,287
TALIESIN: 32 points.

2200
02:05:49,287 --> 02:05:54,825
MATT: With the final bullet in your Pepperbox's
chamber, the sixth bullet,

2201
02:05:54,825 --> 02:05:57,073
you fire the last round--

2202
02:05:57,073 --> 02:06:00,189
TALIESIN: You're going to make me change the
Sharpshooter thing by the

2203
02:06:00,189 --> 02:06:01,935
end of this round I get the--

2204
02:06:01,935 --> 02:06:04,011
MATT: No, no, no. Sharpshooter works well for a
reason.

2205
02:06:04,011 --> 02:06:06,982
TALIESIN: It's kind of spectacular. I keep rolling
20s! I keep rolling 20s!

2206
02:06:06,982 --> 02:06:10,127
MATT: That's what the dice does, man. It's worked
poorly in your favor before.

2207
02:06:10,127 --> 02:06:11,983
TALIESIN: Really poorly, normally!

2208
02:06:11,983 --> 02:06:17,988
MATT: It's great when it works awesomely. So with
this look of confusion as this orc that's trying

2209
02:06:17,988 --> 02:06:20,178
to do the bidding of this gnome that--

2210
02:06:20,178 --> 02:06:22,131
SAM: Protect our goliath!

2211
02:06:22,131 --> 02:06:25,875
MATT: It's trying desperately to go and protect
Grog but on the way there it gets its leg blown

2212
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:30,975
out, and then suddenly it turns and the shot
enters one side of its temple and out the other

2213
02:06:30,975 --> 02:06:38,997
and there's just this very quick (shpt) sound as
it falls to the ground motionless and is no longer

2214
02:06:38,997 --> 02:06:40,262
a living organism.

2215
02:06:40,262 --> 02:06:43,286
SAM: Good job Percy. I sort of had that guy
covered but it's all good. It's all good.

2216
02:06:43,286 --> 02:06:44,570
TALIESIN: I'm coming, Grog!

2217
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:46,715
MATT: Grog, you're up.

2218
02:06:46,715 --> 02:06:51,542
TRAVIS: For the gentleman that I'm facing right
now, I would like to take my first swing.

2219
02:06:51,542 --> 02:06:53,479
MATT: All right.

2220
02:06:53,479 --> 02:06:55,935
TRAVIS: Well all right, 24.

2221
02:06:55,935 --> 02:06:57,722
MATT: 24. That hits.

2222
02:06:57,722 --> 02:07:01,569
TRAVIS: And that is 19 points of damage.

2223
02:07:01,569 --> 02:07:03,373
MATT: Whew. All right.

2224
02:07:03,373 --> 02:07:05,523
TRAVIS: I'll take my second swing at him.

2225
02:07:05,523 --> 02:07:06,257
MATT: Same guy?

2226
02:07:06,257 --> 02:07:07,167
TRAVIS: Same guy.

2227
02:07:07,167 --> 02:07:08,955
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

2228
02:07:08,955 --> 02:07:10,264
TRAVIS: 26.

2229
02:07:10,264 --> 02:07:11,500
MATT: That hits.

2230
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:15,347
TRAVIS: (laughs) Also 19 points of damage.

2231
02:07:15,347 --> 02:07:21,077
MARY: After the Hammer, orcs are nothing.

2232
02:07:21,077 --> 02:07:27,587
MATT: So, the first strike you slam into his upper
torso area and it actually digs about four or five

2233
02:07:27,587 --> 02:07:34,183
inches in. He reaches up and grabs-- drops his
weapon and grabs the axe and tries to pull it out

2234
02:07:34,183 --> 02:07:40,941
of his body. You, however, reach up with your fist
and slam it down on the axe shoving it about five

2235
02:07:40,941 --> 02:07:47,938
or six more inches. You can see his actual
shoulder and arm fall away from his torso as his

2236
02:07:47,938 --> 02:07:50,543
eyes roll back and he falls limp against the
blade.

2237
02:07:50,543 --> 02:07:57,992
TRAVIS: With my third attack, I'd like to turn to
his friend, grab him by the throat and go-- It's

2238
02:07:57,992 --> 02:08:03,029
death, or target practice for my friends. Talk.

2239
02:08:03,029 --> 02:08:07,225
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll.

2240
02:08:07,225 --> 02:08:10,078
TRAVIS: Yay. 19.

2241
02:08:10,078 --> 02:08:20,446
MATT: All right. The orc, looking at its current
fate and the rather rapid destruction of its

2242
02:08:20,446 --> 02:08:27,328
entire band-- (speaks Orcish) Anyone here
speak Orcish?

2243
02:08:27,328 --> 02:08:31,366
MARY: I speak Orc. So, my friend--

2244
02:08:31,366 --> 02:08:33,483
LAURA: What did he say? What did he say?

2245
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:44,229
MATT: You hear him say, "Death may come, but the
rest will find you. You come into our wood. It's

2246
02:08:44,229 --> 02:08:47,241
"only a matter of time before you're eaten."

2247
02:08:47,241 --> 02:08:51,365
LAURA: Tell him we're just passing through.

2248
02:08:51,365 --> 02:08:59,163
MARY: We are simply passing through. We are in
search of something. If you choose to help us, we

2249
02:08:59,163 --> 02:09:00,987
may let you live.

2250
02:09:00,987 --> 02:09:02,739
TRAVIS: Yeah, 'may'.

2251
02:09:02,739 --> 02:09:08,275
MARY: And it is not one of yours.

2252
02:09:08,275 --> 02:09:11,240
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

2253
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:12,444
MARY: What do I roll?

2254
02:09:12,444 --> 02:09:13,979
TRAVIS: 20.

2255
02:09:13,979 --> 02:09:15,177
MARY: What do I add to it?

2256
02:09:15,177 --> 02:09:16,642
SAM: Plus your persuasion.

2257
02:09:16,642 --> 02:09:18,026
TRAVIS: Nine.

2258
02:09:18,175 --> 02:09:19,294
LAURA: Heck yeah!

2259
02:09:19,294 --> 02:09:20,731
MARY: 24!

2260
02:09:20,731 --> 02:09:22,325
TRAVIS: Okay.

2261
02:09:22,325 --> 02:09:26,194
MATT: As you're speaking to him in his own
language, his--

2262
02:09:26,194 --> 02:09:28,633
MARY: (speaks Orcish)

2263
02:09:28,633 --> 02:09:30,070
TRAVIS: Bless you.

2264
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:32,187
MATT: (laughs) You guys hear these horrible
guttural sounds, almost as

2265
02:09:32,187 --> 02:09:34,215
good as Keyleth's Giant.

2266
02:09:34,215 --> 02:09:35,401
TRAVIS: Almost.

2267
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:39,870
MATT: Almost. You can see a look of fear and his
eyes dart about the rest of the party as they all

2268
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:45,038
begin stepping out of the firelight and into the
darkness surrounding him. He gauges the scenario.

2269
02:09:45,038 --> 02:09:50,200
Looks down at the dead dire wolf. He gives you
another look and you still have the flaring blaze

2270
02:09:50,200 --> 02:10:02,803
of your angry Thaumaturgy eyes. He says in Common,
very broken Common-- "Very well. I live. I serve."

2271
02:10:02,849 --> 02:10:08,713
You can see his blood now trickling down to the
corner of his mouth.

2272
02:10:08,713 --> 02:10:10,697
LAURA: What, is he going to fight with us?

2273
02:10:10,697 --> 02:10:12,317
FELICIA: Can I see if he's truthful? Insight?

2274
02:10:12,372 --> 02:10:14,010
MATT: Make an insight check.

2275
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:15,433
FELICIA: Aw, that's not my strength.

2276
02:10:15,433 --> 02:10:16,732
MATT: You can certainly try, though!

2277
02:10:16,732 --> 02:10:18,958
FELICIA: Oh good, I rolled a four!

2278
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:19,771
SAM: Plus two!

2279
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:20,833
FELICIA: Plus two!

2280
02:10:20,833 --> 02:10:22,060
MARY: That's a six.

2281
02:10:22,060 --> 02:10:29,055
MATT: He looks.... constipated? That's the best
way you can read it.

2282
02:10:29,055 --> 02:10:30,476
LAURA: Can I try as well?

2283
02:10:30,476 --> 02:10:31,788
MATT: You're welcome to.

2284
02:10:31,788 --> 02:10:32,951
TRAVIS: Constipated?

2285
02:10:32,951 --> 02:10:39,377
MATT: You're concerned, briefly, for the diet he 
usually eats. Vex, you wanna go ahead?

2286
02:10:39,424 --> 02:10:41,520
LAURA: 16, is what I rolled.

2287
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:48,450
MATT: 16? Ah, there is definitely an intent for
self-preservation, but there is that

2288
02:10:48,450 --> 02:10:50,807
fight-or-flight look in the eyes as well.

2289
02:10:50,807 --> 02:10:52,157
TRAVIS: Let me kill him.

2290
02:10:52,157 --> 02:10:54,230
LAURA: Well, let's find out about our dragon
first.

2291
02:10:54,230 --> 02:10:56,672
FELICIA: Oh! I can cast Friend on him.

2292
02:10:56,672 --> 02:11:00,299
MARY: No, because he'll know you're casting magic
and then he'll come back at you.

2293
02:11:00,299 --> 02:11:01,610
LAURA: Will he?

2294
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:04,371
MATT: He will.

2295
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:06,615
FELICIA: Is that why it never worked on Aldor?

2296
02:11:06,615 --> 02:11:10,059
MARY: Yes, and he'll come back and attack you
afterwards and it can only be used for--

2297
02:11:10,059 --> 02:11:11,615
LAURA: How do you know?

2298
02:11:11,615 --> 02:11:13,306
MARY: Friends! Well, I can cast Friends.

2299
02:11:13,321 --> 02:11:16,403
MATT: Friends, however, has to be on something
that's not hostile, and you get the feeling that

2300
02:11:16,403 --> 02:11:19,826
even though he's currently docile, he's probably a
little hostile.

2301
02:11:19,826 --> 02:11:22,429
FELICIA: Okay, okay. I guess we'll just go
without.

2302
02:11:22,429 --> 02:11:27,450
MARY: Suggestion only works-- but Mass Suggestion
works for a long time.

2303
02:11:27,450 --> 02:11:29,123
LAURA: Why don't we just ask him?

2304
02:11:29,123 --> 02:11:31,987
SAM: Yeah! We got him! We can kill him in a second
if we have to, so--

2305
02:11:31,987 --> 02:11:33,576
MARY: You know we can kill you.

2306
02:11:33,576 --> 02:11:35,495
LAURA: There's a dragon. Where is it?

2307
02:11:35,495 --> 02:11:42,572
MARY: We are looking for a dragon. Specifically, a
white dragon, and we know it is to the north--

2308
02:11:42,572 --> 02:11:43,885
SAM: West.

2309
02:11:43,885 --> 02:11:45,185
MARY: -- west.

2310
02:11:45,185 --> 02:11:57,287
MATT: "This beast, I see-- in the sky. Takes those
who do not hide. Look for the tallest mountain

2311
02:11:57,287 --> 02:12:03,421
"that way." And points up the north area, a little
ways off the road and in the direction you're

2312
02:12:03,421 --> 02:12:12,129
travelling. "It... takes refuge top of the
mountain. There is no path. Just hiding."

2313
02:12:12,129 --> 02:12:14,399
MARY: How tall is the mountain?

2314
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:16,380
MATT: "High."

2315
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:20,969
LAURA: Do you know of a secret passageway to get
up to it?

2316
02:12:20,969 --> 02:12:26,146
MATT: "Only fools would try to scale a dragon's
mountain."

2317
02:12:26,146 --> 02:12:29,607
LAURA: Yeah, well we're pretty stupid. Do you know
of a path?

2318
02:12:29,607 --> 02:12:36,111
MATT: He gives you a look of momentary
indifference and kind of... no.

2319
02:12:36,111 --> 02:12:39,522
FELICIA: I don't believe him. I do not believe
him.

2320
02:12:39,522 --> 02:12:40,632
SAM: He's giving you sass.

2321
02:12:40,632 --> 02:12:42,314
LAURA: He is giving me sass!

2322
02:12:42,314 --> 02:12:44,827
MARY: Yes. Can we-- what do we roll to--

2323
02:12:44,827 --> 02:12:48,134
SAM: While they're talking, I'm going to loot the
other bodies.

2324
02:12:48,134 --> 02:12:58,831
MATT: Okay. As you glance around the corpses, you
find not too much on them, though it looks like

2325
02:12:58,831 --> 02:13:03,976
they've gathered from raiding other people they're
passing on the road, or just scavenging about. You

2326
02:13:03,976 --> 02:13:05,847
find 274 gold.

2327
02:13:05,847 --> 02:13:09,830
FELICIA: Vex, can you do your detect dragon?
Here?

2328
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:11,234
LAURA: I can actually!

2329
02:13:11,234 --> 02:13:13,963
FELICIA: Because I'm not quite there, at a
thousand feet, but--

2330
02:13:13,963 --> 02:13:19,758
LAURA: I can most definitely detect the dragon.
So, you're saying that we need to not be out in

2331
02:13:19,758 --> 02:13:23,000
the open, because the dragon is attracted to
things that are not hidden?

2332
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:23,935
MARY: Yes.

2333
02:13:23,935 --> 02:13:28,473
MATT: "Hungry, it will take you. But that's your
choice."

2334
02:13:28,473 --> 02:13:32,314
MARY: Have you ever seen it up close?

2335
02:13:32,314 --> 02:13:33,707
MATT: "No."

2336
02:13:33,707 --> 02:13:35,266
SAM: Would you like to?

2337
02:13:35,266 --> 02:13:37,303
LAURA: You want to come with us?

2338
02:13:37,303 --> 02:13:39,344
MATT: "No!"

2339
02:13:39,344 --> 02:13:41,090
LAURA: Then stop giving us sass!

2340
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:51,404
MATT: "You say you'll keep me alive but you walk
towards death. One or the other way,

2341
02:13:51,449 --> 02:13:53,075
"I end up at the bottom."

2342
02:13:53,075 --> 02:13:54,974
MARY: We talk towards glory.

2343
02:13:54,974 --> 02:13:59,554
LAURA: Did you see how fast we killed your
friends? We're pretty amazing.

2344
02:13:59,554 --> 02:14:04,688
MATT: "Then go. Go and see your dragon."

2345
02:14:04,688 --> 02:14:13,032
MARY: Do you know of any more information on this
dragon? That's all? Any weaknesses? Anything?

2346
02:14:13,032 --> 02:14:20,456
MATT: He gives you a look like, he's on empty.
He's given you everything he's gonna give you.

2347
02:14:20,456 --> 02:14:24,081
TRAVIS: Well, now you're on empty, I take my
greataxe and I chop off his head.

2348
02:14:24,081 --> 02:14:25,511
ALL: Oh!

2349
02:14:25,511 --> 02:14:27,384
TALIESIN: Guys...

2350
02:14:27,384 --> 02:14:29,530
SAM: No. Wait. Stop.

2351
02:14:29,530 --> 02:14:31,956
FELICIA: Now this is just not right!

2352
02:14:31,956 --> 02:14:37,535
MATT: As the whole group gasps, Grog just shoves
him back and (whoosh whoom, pff pff). The head

2353
02:14:37,579 --> 02:14:42,416
rolls, hits a patch of snow and stops. The body
falls back and you see kind of dark blood begin to

2354
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:44,836
pour out of the rest of the body and into the
snow.

2355
02:14:44,836 --> 02:14:45,616
SAM: Grog.

2356
02:14:45,616 --> 02:14:46,469
TRAVIS: What.

2357
02:14:46,469 --> 02:14:48,537
SAM: You should have checked with our leader
before you did that.

2358
02:14:48,537 --> 02:14:49,934
LAURA: Yes. Most definitely.

2359
02:14:49,934 --> 02:14:52,679
FELICIA: Okay. I think we're going to have to have
a talk circle. Right now.

2360
02:14:52,679 --> 02:14:58,767
MARY: Okay. Before that, do any of the orc have
any iron on them at all?

2361
02:14:58,767 --> 02:15:03,659
MATT: Looking around, there are bits and pieces
of, whether it be iron weapons-- you can see,

2362
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:11,226
scavenged a few-- like some of the axes that were
being used have an iron or similar type metal that

2363
02:15:11,385 --> 02:15:15,160
is crafted in those, though it's usually pretty
beaten and not very well maintained.

2364
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:18,635
MARY: It doesn't matter, I just want the iron.
Whatever I can, I--

2365
02:15:18,635 --> 02:15:21,751
MATT: I'll say you can harvest the iron blades
from three axes.

2366
02:15:21,751 --> 02:15:22,941
MARY: Thank you.

2367
02:15:22,941 --> 02:15:25,791
MATT: They're in relatively poor condition, but
you can mark that.

2368
02:15:25,791 --> 02:15:27,420
TRAVIS: Sorry, Lyra.

2369
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,883
SAM: All right. Are we doing a talk circle?

2370
02:15:28,883 --> 02:15:33,898
FELICIA: I think we need to discuss the fact that
that was just very inappropriate and I am here as

2371
02:15:33,898 --> 02:15:37,461
a leader and I think that that was just not right,
we are better than that.

2372
02:15:37,461 --> 02:15:39,447
LAURA: We are. But here's the thing--

2373
02:15:39,447 --> 02:15:40,865
SAM: You did kill one of them too, though.

2374
02:15:40,865 --> 02:15:41,761
FELICIA: Yes--

2375
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:44,389
MARY: Lyra, we are going to kill-- we are on our
way to kill something.

2376
02:15:44,389 --> 02:15:46,345
FELICIA: Well, it's-- we had a deal.

2377
02:15:46,345 --> 02:15:49,490
LAURA: Well, he probably would've led his friends
to us to kill us.

2378
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:56,150
FELICIA: As a leader I choose not to pursue this
any more, but I will register my disapproval, and

2379
02:15:56,150 --> 02:16:00,863
I think we should just proceed, I'm very, I'm very
vexed.

2380
02:16:00,863 --> 02:16:02,896
TALIESIN: That's very fair, that's very fair.

2381
02:16:02,896 --> 02:16:03,865
FELICIA: Thank you.

2382
02:16:03,865 --> 02:16:05,223
MARY: Scanlan, can't you sing a song to make her
feel better.

2383
02:16:05,223 --> 02:16:06,657
SAM: I could sing a song to make her feel better.

2384
02:16:06,657 --> 02:16:08,222
MARY: But you don't want to.

2385
02:16:08,222 --> 02:16:10,309
LAURA: (sings) Scanlan make you feel good.

2386
02:16:10,309 --> 02:16:12,821
SAM: At least she's not talking about Aldor, so
I'm okay with it.

2387
02:16:12,821 --> 02:16:15,394
FELICIA: Oh, did you want to, we haven't talked
yet.

2388
02:16:15,394 --> 02:16:16,516
SAM: I-- we should go.

2389
02:16:16,516 --> 02:16:18,104
TALIESIN: You should write a song about Aldor.

2390
02:16:18,104 --> 02:16:20,719
TRAVIS: I go over and I pick up the orc's head and
I walk it over to Lyra and I go, here, I'm sorry,

2391
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:23,417
you can keep this. It won't happen without me
asking again.

2392
02:16:23,463 --> 02:16:24,705
FELICIA: No, that's quite all right, it's--

2393
02:16:24,705 --> 02:16:27,015
TRAVIS: No, really, look, it's still got stuff in
it.

2394
02:16:27,015 --> 02:16:29,163
MATT: As he shakes it, you see spattering across
the--

2395
02:16:29,163 --> 02:16:31,733
FELICIA: No, okay-- that's quite-- I think we
should just proceed-- we should proceed,

2396
02:16:31,733 --> 02:16:32,827
everyone.

2397
02:16:32,827 --> 02:16:36,326
LAURA: I'm gonna try to see if there's a dragon
within--

2398
02:16:36,326 --> 02:16:37,947
TALIESIN: And I say we could just cut out the
tongue, it's not--

2399
02:16:37,947 --> 02:16:39,013
TRAVIS: Just the tongue?

2400
02:16:39,013 --> 02:16:39,967
TALIESIN: Like that yes, yes.

2401
02:16:39,967 --> 02:16:41,121
TRAVIS: I rip the tongue out of the head.

2402
02:16:41,121 --> 02:16:42,373
FELICIA: That's a good idea, Vex.

2403
02:16:42,373 --> 02:16:43,481
MARY: Do we need the pelt of the dire wolf?

2404
02:16:43,481 --> 02:16:46,186
TRAVIS: I put the orc tongue in the bag of
holding. And the orc head. Both.

2405
02:16:46,186 --> 02:16:47,141
MARY: Just asking.

2406
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:48,377
MATT: All right.

2407
02:16:48,377 --> 02:16:49,469
TALIESIN: With the lip, now we-- you're slowly--

2408
02:16:49,469 --> 02:16:50,617
TRAVIS: The lip is in my belt, baby.

2409
02:16:50,617 --> 02:16:52,891
MARY: And I would like to extract the canines from
the dire wolf.

2410
02:16:52,891 --> 02:16:55,439
MATT: From the dire wolf, all right. I would like
you to go ahead and make a nature check.

2411
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:56,544
MARY: What's that?

2412
02:16:56,544 --> 02:16:59,941
MATT: That's to attempt to harvest the creature's
canines.

2413
02:16:59,941 --> 02:17:01,377
LAURA: What's that? Sorry?

2414
02:17:01,377 --> 02:17:02,771
MARY: Sorry, what do I do?

2415
02:17:02,905 --> 02:17:05,018
MATT: Roll a d20 and add your nature check bonus.

2416
02:17:05,018 --> 02:17:06,059
MARY: Oh, that sucks.

2417
02:17:06,059 --> 02:17:07,480
LAURA: Can I Primeval Awareness the dragon?

2418
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:08,521
MARY: 12.

2419
02:17:08,521 --> 02:17:15,676
MATT: Okay. As you begin taking a small dagger out
from the inside of your Cloak of Useful Things you

2420
02:17:15,676 --> 02:17:23,310
break one of the tooths in the
process, unfortunately. You manage to get one of

2421
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:27,877
them, at least, so you do have one dire wolf
canine you can add to your items.

2422
02:17:27,877 --> 02:17:35,420
MARY: I would like to put my hands on the dire
wolf and just thank it, for no other reason than I

2423
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:37,027
respect its life.

2424
02:17:37,027 --> 02:17:38,312
MATT: Very well.

2425
02:17:38,312 --> 02:17:40,056
TALIESIN: I don't think he's going to answer.

2426
02:17:40,056 --> 02:17:41,660
MARY: You know, it's not for you, Percy.

2427
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,030
TALIESIN: Oh well, I'm just saying.

2428
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:44,154
LAURA: The dragon, then.

2429
02:17:44,154 --> 02:17:45,156
TALIESIN: I'm trying to be helpful.

2430
02:17:45,156 --> 02:17:46,307
MARY: I understand.

2431
02:17:46,307 --> 02:17:57,268
MATT: All right, you take a moment and concentrate
and, for a six mile radius-- currently no dragon.

2432
02:17:57,268 --> 02:17:59,678
LAURA: Still? It's still-- oh right, it's towards
a mountain.

2433
02:17:59,678 --> 02:18:02,859
SAM: We've got another day's travel, it's got to
be 20 miles away.

2434
02:18:02,859 --> 02:18:05,723
TRAVIS: Should we keep sleeping, or should we just
pack it up now and go?

2435
02:18:05,723 --> 02:18:06,867
SAM: Is it nighttime?

2436
02:18:06,867 --> 02:18:08,634
MATT: It's still-- it's probably like a good two,
three in the morning.

2437
02:18:08,634 --> 02:18:09,825
SAM: Oh, let's go back to bed.

2438
02:18:09,825 --> 02:18:12,520
TRAVIS: Would you say a new day has passed? So can
I try for my beard again?

2439
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:15,147
MATT: We will once you get a full-on rest.

2440
02:18:15,147 --> 02:18:16,151
TRAVIS: Shit.

2441
02:18:16,151 --> 02:18:19,732
FELICIA: Let's fully rest. I'm going to make a
leadership decision that hopefully everybody

2442
02:18:19,732 --> 02:18:21,969
agrees with that we need more sleepytime.

2443
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:26,168
LAURA: Is it okay to keep sleeping right here, are
they going to come search for us? Probably not

2444
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:27,362
more than one search party.

2445
02:18:27,362 --> 02:18:28,208
TALIESIN: Probably not.

2446
02:18:28,208 --> 02:18:29,120
FELICIA: Probably not.

2447
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,545
TALIESIN: I'm in my pyjamas, I'm going back to
bed.

2448
02:18:30,545 --> 02:18:33,030
FELICIA: I think that's a good call that I agree
with as the leader of this group.

2449
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:33,807
TALIESIN: What she said.

2450
02:18:33,807 --> 02:18:35,693
MARY: Are we always going to call it sleepytime?

2451
02:18:35,693 --> 02:18:37,465
FELICIA: I mean, that's.

2452
02:18:37,465 --> 02:18:41,730
MARY: I'm just asking, I like to put labels on
things. It's an OCD thing.

2453
02:18:41,730 --> 02:18:46,416
FELICIA: Whatever you would like to call it. Or
just, yeah.

2454
02:18:46,416 --> 02:18:47,996
MARY: No, you're the leader, I shall accept
whatever name--

2455
02:18:47,996 --> 02:18:49,695
FELICIA: Yes, sleepytime is the official name for
it!

2456
02:18:49,695 --> 02:18:51,397
(laughter)

2457
02:18:51,397 --> 02:18:53,349
MARY: Sleepytime it is. Thank you so much.

2458
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:54,852
TALIESIN: I'm going to sleepytime, good night,
all.

2459
02:18:54,852 --> 02:18:56,423
TRAVIS: Is it-- is it still my watch?

2460
02:18:56,423 --> 02:18:57,521
MATT: It is.

2461
02:18:57,521 --> 02:18:58,338
SAM: You did your job.

2462
02:18:58,338 --> 02:18:59,266
FELICIA: You did your job.

2463
02:18:59,266 --> 02:19:00,210
SAM: I'll take the next watch.

2464
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:01,489
TRAVIS: Thanks. (snores)

2465
02:19:01,489 --> 02:19:02,721
MARY: May I?

2466
02:19:02,721 --> 02:19:04,561
FELICIA: And we can heal up, right?

2467
02:19:04,561 --> 02:19:08,519
MATT: Yes, so the rest of you guys, you go ahead
and take your full evening's rest, at which point

2468
02:19:08,519 --> 02:19:13,046
your hit points and spells are restored. And Grog,
go ahead and make a percentage roll.

2469
02:19:13,092 --> 02:19:18,724
TRAVIS: Yeah! Come on, you big bearded bastard!
58.

2470
02:19:18,724 --> 02:19:21,332
MATT: 58, nah, unfortunately.

2471
02:19:21,332 --> 02:19:26,109
MATT: But you've still got that nice scruff, a
good like, y'know, half an inch to an inch of

2472
02:19:26,109 --> 02:19:29,902
whatever that is pushing through.

2473
02:19:29,902 --> 02:19:32,663
TRAVIS: Dire wolf blood all over my feet didn't
stimulate the growth at all?

2474
02:19:32,663 --> 02:19:33,730
MATT: Unfortunately no.

2475
02:19:33,730 --> 02:19:34,744
TRAVIS: All right.

2476
02:19:34,744 --> 02:19:36,190
MARY: That blood looked quite black.

2477
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:39,650
MATT: Eventually you all complete your evening's
rest, the rest of the watches go without incident,

2478
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:44,098
in the morning you wake up and the cold air was
pretty rough for a lot of you. Thankfully the fire

2479
02:19:44,098 --> 02:19:50,576
was there to help, but you're-- you get the
feeling that the further north you travel, the

2480
02:19:50,576 --> 02:19:56,214
weather's going to become an issue, even with the
warm clothing you currently have on. All right. So

2481
02:19:56,214 --> 02:19:59,426
you guys step back to where your horses are
currently--

2482
02:19:59,426 --> 02:20:01,105
LAURA: Oh. Our horses are okay?

2483
02:20:01,105 --> 02:20:03,200
TRAVIS: Oh shit, we forgot about those.

2484
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:10,302
MATT: Thankfully, your horses were far enough away
from the area where you were, the focus was not to

2485
02:20:10,302 --> 02:20:14,396
make any noise when they came upon you, so the
orcish party knew better than

2486
02:20:14,396 --> 02:20:15,680
to attack the horses first.

2487
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:16,783
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

2488
02:20:16,783 --> 02:20:19,663
MATT: The horses are still a little spooked from
the evening's events, but nevertheless. You get

2489
02:20:19,663 --> 02:20:23,224
back on your horses, you continue up the Glasswalk
Road. You had a question?

2490
02:20:23,224 --> 02:20:29,186
MARY: I use Beast Speech to calm them. Tell them 
everything shall be fine.

2491
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:31,108
TRAVIS: You have just got all sorts of shit.

2492
02:20:31,108 --> 02:20:35,663
MARY: Everything will be wonderful and thank you
for leading us where we need to go. We shall try

2493
02:20:35,663 --> 02:20:38,397
and make sure that no harm comes to you.

2494
02:20:38,397 --> 02:20:41,411
MATT: And immediately with that, the horses who
were currently rattled, and some of them are being

2495
02:20:41,411 --> 02:20:48,191
unresponsive to your attempts to mount them,
settle down, come to a calm point and allow you

2496
02:20:48,191 --> 02:20:50,656
all to get atop them without an issue.

2497
02:20:50,656 --> 02:20:53,007
TRAVIS: Being fully asleep, I cast fart.

2498
02:20:53,007 --> 02:20:54,959
(laughter)

2499
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:57,300
MATT: All right.

2500
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:00,727
TALIESIN: The irony is, I was going to recommend
Dust of Tracelessness, but that works too.

2501
02:21:00,727 --> 02:21:01,918
LAURA: Oh, that works too. Can you--

2502
02:21:01,918 --> 02:21:03,407
TALIESIN: They would never follow that, so.

2503
02:21:03,407 --> 02:21:05,609
MATT: Dust of-- Cloud of Deterrence.

2504
02:21:05,609 --> 02:21:07,307
TALIESIN: Cloud of Deterrence, thank you.

2505
02:21:07,307 --> 02:21:10,815
MARY: What do you want to do, my love. Dear.
Whoever you are.

2506
02:21:10,815 --> 02:21:14,156
LAURA: Oh yes, Dust of Tracelessness. He's got
this stuff, we can cover our tracks.

2507
02:21:14,156 --> 02:21:15,238
TRAVIS: Should we sleep?

2508
02:21:15,238 --> 02:21:16,596
FELICIA: We slept already, we're on the horses.

2509
02:21:16,596 --> 02:21:18,126
SAM: It's the next day.

2510
02:21:18,126 --> 02:21:19,103
TRAVIS: Oh, it is?

2511
02:21:19,103 --> 02:21:20,155
LAURA: Yeah.

2512
02:21:20,155 --> 02:21:21,471
TRAVIS: Oh. We ride.

2513
02:21:21,471 --> 02:21:22,505
SAM: We ride!

2514
02:21:22,505 --> 02:21:23,528
MARY: And so we ride!

2515
02:21:23,528 --> 02:21:26,138
TRAVIS: And I take the Dust of Tracelessness and
I, in the back.

2516
02:21:26,138 --> 02:21:28,083
SAM: Do we ever run out of that stuff?

2517
02:21:28,083 --> 02:21:28,976
LAURA: Never.

2518
02:21:28,976 --> 02:21:30,382
TRAVIS: No, it's an infinite supply.

2519
02:21:30,382 --> 02:21:31,235
SAM: Wow.

2520
02:21:31,235 --> 02:21:32,334
FELICIA: That is very convenient.

2521
02:21:32,334 --> 02:21:33,861
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is, it's really nice.

2522
02:21:33,861 --> 02:21:38,068
MATT: (laughs) And so as you're on your warhorse,
which, as you can tell the more and more you ride

2523
02:21:38,068 --> 02:21:42,832
on it the more and more it's starting to slow.
Thankfully you're keeping pace with Trinket, it's

2524
02:21:42,832 --> 02:21:45,684
having a hard time keeping a goliath on its back
for extensive riding.

2525
02:21:45,684 --> 02:21:48,822
TRAVIS: Could I give it-- could I give it a health
potion?

2526
02:21:48,822 --> 02:21:53,703
MATT: Let's just say it's probably going to be a
little sway-backed by the end of this adventure.

2527
02:21:53,703 --> 02:21:55,168
LAURA: Oh, poor thing.

2528
02:21:55,168 --> 02:21:56,738
FELICIA: Poor little horsie.

2529
02:21:56,738 --> 02:21:58,403
MARY: It may need to ride you.

2530
02:21:58,403 --> 02:21:59,462
MATT: It's okay for now.

2531
02:21:59,462 --> 02:22:01,156
TALIESIN: At some point you should give it a break
with the carpet.

2532
02:22:01,156 --> 02:22:01,949
LAURA: Yeah.

2533
02:22:01,949 --> 02:22:03,182
TRAVIS: I can't ride the carpet.

2534
02:22:03,182 --> 02:22:04,181
SAM: We don't have the carpet.

2535
02:22:04,181 --> 02:22:05,057
LAURA: Why did we--

2536
02:22:05,057 --> 02:22:05,864
SAM: Do we have the carpet?

2537
02:22:05,864 --> 02:22:07,129
TRAVIS: We gave the carpet to them.

2538
02:22:07,129 --> 02:22:09,347
LAURA: The other team has the carpet? Those
bastards.

2539
02:22:09,347 --> 02:22:10,865
FELICIA: I don't know them, but that's very-- that
is upsetting.

2540
02:22:10,865 --> 02:22:12,138
TRAVIS: Yeah. That is.

2541
02:22:12,138 --> 02:22:14,125
MATT: You guys continue traveling for a second
day--

2542
02:22:14,125 --> 02:22:16,903
LAURA: Why? Because Tiberius can fly, why the hell
did we give them the carpet?

2543
02:22:16,903 --> 02:22:18,586
(laughter)

2544
02:22:18,586 --> 02:22:20,652
LAURA: Sorry.

2545
02:22:20,652 --> 02:22:22,003
MARY: Oh.

2546
02:22:22,003 --> 02:22:24,829
SAM: It's all right, we don't need the crutch.

2547
02:22:24,829 --> 02:22:26,132
LAURA: All right.

2548
02:22:26,132 --> 02:22:27,079
TRAVIS: Second day.

2549
02:22:27,079 --> 02:22:28,053
SAM: We're fine.

2550
02:22:28,053 --> 02:22:29,093
MARY: Day two.

2551
02:22:29,093 --> 02:22:32,022
FELICIA: And so anyway, so, when I first met
Aldor--

2552
02:22:32,022 --> 02:22:32,888
SAM: Uh-huh.

2553
02:22:32,888 --> 02:22:37,576
FELICIA: -- he was hired to be my bodyguard and it
was so obvious that he was so capable when he

2554
02:22:37,639 --> 02:22:38,837
walked in the room--

2555
02:22:38,837 --> 02:22:41,984
SAM: How did he react when you first told him of
your feelings?

2556
02:22:41,984 --> 02:22:47,085
FELICIA: I mean, it was not a good evening, but he
was paid to be there so he couldn't leave, so that

2557
02:22:47,085 --> 02:22:48,482
was, well, that was good for me--

2558
02:22:48,482 --> 02:22:49,865
SAM: Always works for me.

2559
02:22:49,865 --> 02:22:51,788
FELICIA: It's not, it didn't work today, but it
could work tomorrow or the day after.

2560
02:22:51,788 --> 02:22:53,447
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Can we make an agreement. I
kill you, you kill me?

2561
02:22:53,447 --> 02:22:54,395
MARY: Yes.

2562
02:22:54,395 --> 02:22:56,243
FELICIA: And suddenly he disappears, it's so funny
that--

2563
02:22:56,243 --> 02:22:57,508
SAM: Well, you-- men are complicated.

2564
02:22:57,508 --> 02:22:59,609
MATT: A few hours of-- a few hours of travel
and--

2565
02:22:59,609 --> 02:23:01,135
MARY: Percy, any extra guns?

2566
02:23:01,135 --> 02:23:02,084
TALIESIN: What?

2567
02:23:02,084 --> 02:23:03,136
MARY: Sorry.

2568
02:23:03,136 --> 02:23:11,056
MATT: Learning the ins and outs of the extremely
tumultuous history of Lyra and Aldor, you

2569
02:23:11,056 --> 02:23:15,917
eventually come to a point where the clouds are
beginning to darken, and in the distance you can

2570
02:23:15,917 --> 02:23:23,850
see what looks like a very heavily obscured
curtain of snowfall to the north-northwest. You

2571
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:31,973
get to a point of the Glasswalk Road where a
snowstorm is starting to pour over this vicinity.

2572
02:23:31,973 --> 02:23:41,835
You guys stop for a second and repackage yourself
with your fur and heavy winter clothing, and even

2573
02:23:41,835 --> 02:23:45,214
still it's very, very chilly. I'd like everybody
to make a constitution save.

2574
02:23:45,214 --> 02:23:47,480
LAURA: Are we still in the forest?

2575
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:52,155
MATT: You are nearing forest, yes. So yeah, you
would be considered in forest area.

2576
02:23:52,155 --> 02:23:53,371
LAURA: Okay.

2577
02:23:53,371 --> 02:23:56,603
TRAVIS: Aren't I good like above 20,000 feet in
really, really cold environments?

2578
02:23:56,603 --> 02:23:58,586
MATT: Yes, you have advantage on this.

2579
02:23:58,586 --> 02:24:01,800
LAURA: Natural 20! Sorry, that was my first one.

2580
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,261
FELICIA: You're so warm.

2581
02:24:03,261 --> 02:24:04,381
MATT: (laughs) So warm.

2582
02:24:04,381 --> 02:24:06,046
LAURA: It's bad thing to roll a natural 20 on.

2583
02:24:06,046 --> 02:24:07,873
TALIESIN: We're cuddling you for warmth,
apparently. You're like an oven.

2584
02:24:07,873 --> 02:24:09,014
LAURA: It's Trinket, you know.

2585
02:24:09,014 --> 02:24:09,961
MARY: 15.

2586
02:24:09,961 --> 02:24:11,048
MATT: All right.

2587
02:24:11,048 --> 02:24:12,460
FELICIA: 20.

2588
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:13,643
SAM: Four.

2589
02:24:13,643 --> 02:24:14,525
TALIESIN: 24.

2590
02:24:14,525 --> 02:24:16,382
SAM: Hey, that adds up.

2591
02:24:16,382 --> 02:24:18,329
TRAVIS: Is this a constitution saving throw or
just a modifier?

2592
02:24:18,329 --> 02:24:20,574
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, so you
roll twice and take the higher.

2593
02:24:20,574 --> 02:24:22,096
TRAVIS: Oh, wow. 23.

2594
02:24:22,096 --> 02:24:24,734
MATT: I think, I'm pretty sure that's how that
works. I'll check here with the goliath as the

2595
02:24:24,734 --> 02:24:28,472
mountain-born-- oh, you're just naturally adapted
to it, so you're fine.

2596
02:24:28,472 --> 02:24:33,716
TRAVIS: (laughs) I've got my chest out, my nipples
aren't even getting hard. It's amazing.

2597
02:24:33,716 --> 02:24:38,462
TALIESIN: Oddly, your face is a bit cold because
it's so bare.

2598
02:24:38,462 --> 02:24:43,109
TRAVIS: Your instinct-- that was a low blow. That
was a low blow.

2599
02:24:43,153 --> 02:24:47,996
MATT: All right, so all of you manage-- Scanlan,
mark yourself, you have one level of fatigue.

2600
02:24:47,996 --> 02:24:49,297
LAURA and MARY: Oh no.

2601
02:24:49,297 --> 02:24:51,109
SAM: What's that mean, what's that mean?

2602
02:24:51,109 --> 02:24:52,703
MATT: Fatigue, let me go ahead and make sure--

2603
02:24:52,703 --> 02:24:54,465
MARY: Too much listening to-- oh, sorry.

2604
02:24:54,465 --> 02:24:58,485
FELICIA: Does he look cold? I'm going to give him
my stone, I'm going to give him my stone of

2605
02:24:58,485 --> 02:24:59,479
resisting cold.

2606
02:24:59,479 --> 02:25:01,062
TRAVIS: That was bullshit, Percy.

2607
02:25:01,062 --> 02:25:02,117
SAM: What about you?

2608
02:25:02,117 --> 02:25:04,569
FELICIA: It's okay. I'm a leader, and a leader
sacrifices--

2609
02:25:04,569 --> 02:25:06,006
SAM: I can't let you do that, Lyra.

2610
02:25:06,006 --> 02:25:10,233
FELICIA: No, really, just take it. You listened to
me so good. It's like we're besties.

2611
02:25:10,233 --> 02:25:14,610
SAM: I feel-- I feel a connection, I do. You know
when you were telling me about Aldor--

2612
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:15,746
FELICIA: It's not sexual at all.

2613
02:25:15,746 --> 02:25:16,665
SAM: No-- I-- uh.

2614
02:25:16,665 --> 02:25:18,969
FELICIA: I'm not attracted to you at all, like
literally if it happened I would be ill, but it's

2615
02:25:18,969 --> 02:25:20,046
really nice--

2616
02:25:20,046 --> 02:25:23,192
SAM: Believe me, you sexually? You repulse me.

2617
02:25:23,192 --> 02:25:24,111
FELICIA: Thank you!

2618
02:25:24,111 --> 02:25:25,211
SAM: Yeah, no, really.

2619
02:25:25,211 --> 02:25:26,428
FELICIA: Oh my god, I'm so with you right there.

2620
02:25:26,428 --> 02:25:27,309
SAM: Oh yeah.

2621
02:25:27,309 --> 02:25:28,476
FELICIA: But really, as a friend you are so nice.

2622
02:25:28,476 --> 02:25:29,568
SAM: I feel a connection too!

2623
02:25:29,568 --> 02:25:30,737
FELICIA: So here's the stone.

2624
02:25:30,737 --> 02:25:32,688
SAM: I have had some Aldors in my life, too.

2625
02:25:32,688 --> 02:25:34,268
FELICIA: I want to hear all about them.

2626
02:25:34,268 --> 02:25:37,923
SAM: Yes, mainly they were whores who kicked me
out early.

2627
02:25:37,923 --> 02:25:39,140
FELICIA: Oh.

2628
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:43,182
SAM: But they-- in a similar way they disrespected
me, didn't see the true Scanlan

2629
02:25:43,182 --> 02:25:44,697
that I could've been.

2630
02:25:44,697 --> 02:25:47,366
FELICIA: I mean, I was-- listen. The one time we
were together it was after I gave him armor, but

2631
02:25:47,366 --> 02:25:48,537
he was not servicing me--

2632
02:25:48,537 --> 02:25:49,742
SAM: Wait, together?

2633
02:25:49,742 --> 02:25:50,518
FELICIA: Yes.

2634
02:25:50,518 --> 02:25:51,363
SAM: You've been with him?

2635
02:25:51,363 --> 02:25:52,320
FELICIA: Of course, I told you--

2636
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:54,517
MARY: Oh look, we seem to be coming to something
interesting in the road.

2637
02:25:54,517 --> 02:25:55,728
FELICIA: Were you not listening?

2638
02:25:55,728 --> 02:25:57,034
SAM: I thought you meant that as a metaphor.

2639
02:25:57,034 --> 02:26:00,771
FELICIA: No, it was his birthday and I bought him
some very expensive custom armor that he-- you

2640
02:26:00,771 --> 02:26:04,117
said he had it on, which is-- he obviously has
feelings for me to wear that armor.

2641
02:26:04,117 --> 02:26:05,789
It was 10,000 gold--

2642
02:26:05,789 --> 02:26:06,780
LAURA: (gasps)

2643
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:12,049
FELICIA: -- and he just, he was very attracted to
me that night and we had intercourse so. My uncle

2644
02:26:12,049 --> 02:26:13,162
was very upset with me.

2645
02:26:13,162 --> 02:26:14,567
TRAVIS: Intercourse.

2646
02:26:14,567 --> 02:26:16,572
FELICIA: And after that, he never saw--

2647
02:26:16,572 --> 02:26:23,483
SAM: Somehow you made that less sexual than I
could've ever imagined. Is there-- Grog, what's

2648
02:26:23,543 --> 02:26:28,268
the term for when your penis is inverted? The
opposite of a boner?

2649
02:26:28,268 --> 02:26:29,581
TRAVIS: Belly button.

2650
02:26:29,581 --> 02:26:30,865
SAM: Yeah, that's what I've got now.

2651
02:26:30,865 --> 02:26:36,112
FELICIA: Anyway, I was really certain after that
moment that we would be together forever and I

2652
02:26:36,112 --> 02:26:37,280
never saw him again.

2653
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,767
SAM: You know men are fickle and when I-- I'll
have a talk with him.

2654
02:26:40,767 --> 02:26:43,204
FELICIA: He kept the armor, so he has feelings.
Let's just move on.

2655
02:26:43,204 --> 02:26:44,101
SAM: Let's do it.

2656
02:26:44,101 --> 02:26:44,965
FELICIA: Here's the stone.

2657
02:26:44,965 --> 02:26:45,883
SAM: Let's not dwell.

2658
02:26:45,883 --> 02:26:49,505
MATT: You take the stone and your fatigue fades.
You find yourself adjusting well to the cold

2659
02:26:49,505 --> 02:26:53,744
climate, thanks to your gift from your new leader
and--

2660
02:26:53,744 --> 02:26:55,279
SAM: I love her.

2661
02:26:55,279 --> 02:26:56,628
MARY: Leader-slash-lover?

2662
02:26:56,628 --> 02:27:05,084
MATT: All right, so as you guys pull off the side
of the road and use the cover of the forest to

2663
02:27:05,084 --> 02:27:10,100
help from the snow that's beginning to hit even
harder, you gather there is in this vicinity an

2664
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:16,778
ever waxing-and-waning blizzard that pours
through. You can see a localized area that is not

2665
02:27:16,778 --> 02:27:21,540
really moving. You wait like a good 20, 30 minutes
to see if there's any movement but the blizzard is

2666
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,673
not shifting from its location.

2667
02:27:23,673 --> 02:27:29,741
FELICIA: Should we try to do the spell, locate
dragon again, just to make sure

2668
02:27:29,741 --> 02:27:31,073
it's at the top of this--

2669
02:27:31,073 --> 02:27:32,412
SAM: Good leading, good leading.

2670
02:27:32,412 --> 02:27:33,983
LAURA: Sure, I will try it again.

2671
02:27:33,983 --> 02:27:45,354
MATT: All right. You sit and concentrate for a
moment and... nothing. Nothing-- wait. You sense

2672
02:27:45,354 --> 02:27:49,268
this very, very small blip at the edge, it's
moving quickly.

2673
02:27:49,268 --> 02:27:51,780
LAURA: There. There's a dragon.

2674
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:54,071
FELICIA: Where is it, which, which--

2675
02:27:54,071 --> 02:27:55,457
LAURA: It's fast, wait.

2676
02:27:55,457 --> 02:27:57,530
SAM: Which way, east, north, south?

2677
02:27:57,530 --> 02:27:59,981
MATT: It's getting closer, you can sense its
energy up in the air.

2678
02:27:59,981 --> 02:28:01,305
LAURA: It's up in the air.

2679
02:28:01,305 --> 02:28:06,731
MATT: At that point you hear this distant guttural
howl, just a--

2680
02:28:06,731 --> 02:28:08,870
LAURA: We should hide just in case. How about we
hide?

2681
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:14,718
MATT: (raaah!) comes bursting out over the air.
The wind begins to pick up and the snowfall begins

2682
02:28:14,718 --> 02:28:18,235
to become ice. The rest of you guys have to kind
of duck yourself out of the way--

2683
02:28:18,235 --> 02:28:19,474
LAURA: No way.

2684
02:28:19,474 --> 02:28:22,343
MATT: -- everyone make a reflex, or sorry, a
dexterity saving throw.

2685
02:28:22,343 --> 02:28:23,821
MARY: What's that?

2686
02:28:23,821 --> 02:28:25,474
FELICIA: I am very good at that.

2687
02:28:25,474 --> 02:28:27,994
SAM: I don't even know what this is, what is
this?

2688
02:28:27,994 --> 02:28:30,676
FELICIA: That's a nine.

2689
02:28:30,676 --> 02:28:31,980
MARY:12.

2690
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:33,070
TRAVIS: Eight.

2691
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:35,700
SAM: 13.

2692
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:36,976
FELICIA: 11.

2693
02:28:36,976 --> 02:28:38,174
TALIESIN: 16.

2694
02:28:38,174 --> 02:28:39,404
LAURA: 24.

2695
02:28:39,404 --> 02:28:44,437
MATT: All right. All of you guys manage to find
cover under the nearest tree where the bough of

2696
02:28:44,437 --> 02:28:54,195
the forest is at its strongest. You avoid most of
the brunt impact, Grog unfortunately takes a good

2697
02:28:54,195 --> 02:29:00,355
portion of slamming ice-stone damage. Negligible
for most damage you're used to, but you still take

2698
02:29:00,355 --> 02:29:04,088
four points of bludgeoning damage from the falling
ice.

2699
02:29:04,088 --> 02:29:05,180
TRAVIS: All right.

2700
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:09,111
MATT: The sleet. As you guys are currently in this
position, you can see barely through the very very

2701
02:29:09,111 --> 02:29:14,543
heavy snowfall a shape that (whoo) moves over in
the distance that circles around and then heads

2702
02:29:14,543 --> 02:29:18,868
back in a western direction.

2703
02:29:18,868 --> 02:29:20,419
SAM: Can we get its attention?

2704
02:29:20,419 --> 02:29:24,505
MARY: I cast Beast Speak and say, where do you
live?! I'm kidding.

2705
02:29:24,552 --> 02:29:26,615
TRAVIS: I was like, really?

2706
02:29:26,615 --> 02:29:29,428
TALIESIN: Thank you for that addendum, because
we--

2707
02:29:29,428 --> 02:29:31,037
LAURA and MARY: Not really.

2708
02:29:31,037 --> 02:29:32,024
MARY: Not really.

2709
02:29:32,024 --> 02:29:33,438
LAURA: All of us are like, ahh.

2710
02:29:33,438 --> 02:29:34,783
MARY: I have a sick sense of humor.

2711
02:29:34,783 --> 02:29:37,670
LAURA: Can I see which direction it's going back
towards the mountain?

2712
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:43,475
MATT: Yeah. You look over in that direction and
you can barely make it through bits as the storm

2713
02:29:43,475 --> 02:29:48,858
intensifies and begins to subside a little bit,
you can see what looks to be the gentle outline of

2714
02:29:48,858 --> 02:29:53,861
a mountain range maybe about ten miles off from
the road. To the west of the road,

2715
02:29:53,861 --> 02:29:55,503
into the forest itself.

2716
02:29:55,503 --> 02:29:56,771
LAURA: Great.

2717
02:29:56,771 --> 02:29:58,141
SAM: We've got this.

2718
02:29:58,141 --> 02:29:59,214
LAURA: We got to go in the forest.

2719
02:29:59,214 --> 02:30:02,174
FELICIA: Okay. Let's go!

2720
02:30:02,174 --> 02:30:05,285
MARY: It should provide us with some cover from
the snow as well.

2721
02:30:05,335 --> 02:30:07,603
SAM: But who knows what lurks in those woods?

2722
02:30:07,603 --> 02:30:08,617
MARY: This is true.

2723
02:30:08,617 --> 02:30:11,354
LAURA: Well, I can also, you know, see what kind
of creatures are around.

2724
02:30:11,354 --> 02:30:12,499
SAM: All right.

2725
02:30:12,499 --> 02:30:13,578
MARY: Oh, yes.

2726
02:30:13,578 --> 02:30:17,585
LAURA: No, I can't. I can't see animals. Just
kidding.

2727
02:30:17,585 --> 02:30:20,282
FELICIA: Well, we don't really have a choice, we
have to get the dragon.

2728
02:30:20,282 --> 02:30:21,289
SAM: Let's plunge in.

2729
02:30:21,289 --> 02:30:22,392
FELICIA: And we have a time limit.

2730
02:30:22,392 --> 02:30:23,506
TRAVIS: You're the team leader.

2731
02:30:23,506 --> 02:30:25,849
FELICIA: We have-- we need-- now there's really no
other way to go,

2732
02:30:25,849 --> 02:30:26,950
we have to go through the forest?

2733
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:28,445
MATT: Currently.

2734
02:30:28,445 --> 02:30:29,257
FELICIA: Currently.

2735
02:30:29,257 --> 02:30:34,007
MATT: Unless you guys have any other plan, right
now there is about ten miles of forest between

2736
02:30:34,007 --> 02:30:38,779
you, near the roadway, and this mountain range,
where apparently the dragon has returned to.

2737
02:30:38,779 --> 02:30:42,854
FELICIA: Great, okay. Well, there's nothing else
to be done, we just have to go as fast as we can.

2738
02:30:42,854 --> 02:30:44,059
LAURA: All right.

2739
02:30:44,059 --> 02:30:45,877
MARY: I could cast Invisibility and Fly, I could
fly us all somewhere.

2740
02:30:45,877 --> 02:30:47,433
FELICIA: I don't really have any other--

2741
02:30:47,433 --> 02:30:49,447
LAURA: Oh, you can't fly all of us, can you?

2742
02:30:49,447 --> 02:30:51,282
MARY: I think I can fly up to nine, I thought.

2743
02:30:51,282 --> 02:30:53,390
LAURA: You can fly up to nine people?

2744
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:54,310
SAM: What?

2745
02:30:54,310 --> 02:30:56,224
LAURA: Tiberius can only fly up to three people.

2746
02:30:56,224 --> 02:30:57,391
SAM: What kind of devil are you?

2747
02:30:57,391 --> 02:30:58,568
FELICIA: Oh, should we fly? We--

2748
02:30:58,568 --> 02:30:59,756
SAM: Wait, can you fly?

2749
02:30:59,756 --> 02:31:02,448
FELICIA: I can't fly, no, but maybe Zahra can
fly.

2750
02:31:02,448 --> 02:31:06,696
LAURA: If we're flying, though, I'm just going to
put this out there. There's nowhere to hide if the

2751
02:31:06,696 --> 02:31:08,079
dragon comes back out.

2752
02:31:08,079 --> 02:31:10,160
MARY: I understand, but I can also cast
Invisibility.

2753
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,455
LAURA: Well, that's awesome.

2754
02:31:11,455 --> 02:31:13,261
FELICIA: But that doesn't last as long, or--

2755
02:31:13,261 --> 02:31:17,625
MARY: I can target one additional creature for
each slot above third, what does that mean?

2756
02:31:17,625 --> 02:31:21,665
MATT: It means, if everything you cast is at
maximum level, it would be fifth level, which

2757
02:31:21,665 --> 02:31:23,496
means you could target three creatures with
Invisibility.

2758
02:31:23,496 --> 02:31:25,821
MARY: Three creatures with Invisibility and three
creatures with Fly.

2759
02:31:25,874 --> 02:31:28,379
LAURA: But is it at the same time or is it a
concentration?

2760
02:31:28,379 --> 02:31:33,609
MATT: It's a concentration either way. I will say,
as soon as you start thinking about flying and

2761
02:31:33,609 --> 02:31:37,353
getting there, you look up past where the trees
are. Flying in this weather

2762
02:31:37,353 --> 02:31:39,956
would be a terrible idea.

2763
02:31:39,956 --> 02:31:41,233
FELICIA: That's a terrible idea.

2764
02:31:41,233 --> 02:31:42,302
MARY: All right.

2765
02:31:42,302 --> 02:31:45,014
FELICIA: You know what I was thinking, it might
not be good. It might not be good. Let's just

2766
02:31:45,014 --> 02:31:48,010
ride, we have the horses, we can't leave the
horses behind. We only have--

2767
02:31:48,010 --> 02:31:49,383
TRAVIS: Right, okay. We start riding.

2768
02:31:49,383 --> 02:31:52,107
SAM: We could, we just rented them. 50 bucks, so.

2769
02:31:52,107 --> 02:31:56,538
FELICIA: Don't remind me of that, that was just a
thing. All right, onward! Let's--

2770
02:31:56,538 --> 02:31:58,691
TRAVIS: I'm still in the back doing the dust of
uhhh.

2771
02:31:58,691 --> 02:31:59,646
FELICIA: Yay, go.

2772
02:31:59,646 --> 02:32:00,810
MATT: Dust of uhhh?

2773
02:32:00,810 --> 02:32:02,101
TRAVIS: Nay-nay.

2774
02:32:02,101 --> 02:32:03,209
MARY: We ride!

2775
02:32:03,209 --> 02:32:10,426
MATT: As the flower girl picks up the back end,
you guys trudge on horseback into the heart of

2776
02:32:10,426 --> 02:32:17,176
this section of the Vesper Timberlands. It is a
very dense forest and you find that any

2777
02:32:17,176 --> 02:32:20,412
straight-road path is not going to function, as
you're constantly having to weave in and out from

2778
02:32:20,412 --> 02:32:25,506
the thick tree trunks and heavy foliage that has
taken over the floor. Plus a layer of snow that

2779
02:32:25,506 --> 02:32:32,206
tends to encapsulate the area, your movement is
relatively restrained than this pace you're

2780
02:32:32,206 --> 02:32:35,983
normally used to going. You have-- what bonuses do
you have because of the forest terrain?

2781
02:32:35,983 --> 02:32:37,273
LAURA: I have--

2782
02:32:37,273 --> 02:32:38,883
MATT: To the group's movement, if any?

2783
02:32:38,883 --> 02:32:42,437
LAURA: Yes, movement is fine for all of the
group.

2784
02:32:42,437 --> 02:32:46,387
MATT: Thankfully, though, you have Vex guiding you
on this path and where it would be a very

2785
02:32:46,387 --> 02:32:51,541
difficult experience pushing through this forest,
especially with the time limit you have, she is

2786
02:32:51,541 --> 02:32:56,014
able to find the quickest paths to dodge any of
the heavy areas that are dense

2787
02:32:56,014 --> 02:32:57,438
with dangerous snowfall.

2788
02:32:57,438 --> 02:33:02,071
LAURA: I would also like to perception ahead and
make sure that nothing is going to

2789
02:33:02,071 --> 02:33:03,517
sneak attack us again.

2790
02:33:03,517 --> 02:33:04,754
MATT: Understood, understood.

2791
02:33:04,754 --> 02:33:06,096
FELICIA: Very good call.

2792
02:33:06,096 --> 02:33:10,498
MATT: All right. In that regard, I would like you
to go ahead and make a perception check.

2793
02:33:10,498 --> 02:33:17,134
SAM: Oh boy. Something out there. Nope.

2794
02:33:17,134 --> 02:33:21,953
LAURA: That is lower than my passive perception,
though. Which is 21.

2795
02:33:21,953 --> 02:33:23,856
SAM: Your passive perception--

2796
02:33:23,856 --> 02:33:25,039
LAURA: -- is 21.

2797
02:33:25,039 --> 02:33:25,982
MATT: Right.

2798
02:33:25,982 --> 02:33:26,934
SAM: Wow.

2799
02:33:26,934 --> 02:33:30,691
LAURA: And plus five-- no, that's it, just 21. But
it's a 12. For right now.

2800
02:33:30,691 --> 02:33:34,137
MATT: It's a 12? Okay. You keep an eye out as you
continue to move forward.

2801
02:33:34,137 --> 02:33:38,780
LAURA: Oh, but I get to roll twice though, because
it's my favored terrain?

2802
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:41,084
MATT: That's true, you do. Advantage on that.

2803
02:33:41,084 --> 02:33:45,344
LAURA: Okay. Shut up.

2804
02:33:45,344 --> 02:33:47,243
SAM: When the cameraman laughs.

2805
02:33:47,243 --> 02:33:49,590
MARY: When the cameraman is laughing at you, you
know it's a good roll.

2806
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:52,747
LAURA: It's-- no, that's not that bad-- It's 15.

2807
02:33:52,747 --> 02:33:54,275
MATT: That's an improvement.

2808
02:33:54,275 --> 02:33:55,524
LAURA: It's a slight improvement.

2809
02:33:55,524 --> 02:33:56,720
FELICIA: Better than 12.

2810
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:57,694
LAURA: That's right.

2811
02:33:57,694 --> 02:33:58,899
MATT: 15 is indeed--

2812
02:33:58,899 --> 02:34:00,564
MATT and TALIESIN: -- better than 12.

2813
02:34:00,564 --> 02:34:02,382
MATT: The things you learn watching Critical Role,
ladies and gentlemen.

2814
02:34:02,533 --> 02:34:04,025
SAM: (sings) The more you know.

2815
02:34:04,025 --> 02:34:05,179
TRAVIS: Learning.

2816
02:34:05,179 --> 02:34:11,573
MATT: So in following Vex through the forest,
weaving back and forth, about an hour of travel in

2817
02:34:11,573 --> 02:34:16,436
you-- I know you gotta get going soon. How soon do
you have to go?

2818
02:34:16,497 --> 02:34:19,842
LAURA: We're calling a car, and it's however soon
it gets here.

2819
02:34:19,842 --> 02:34:29,401
MATT: All right. Pushing forward, you eventually
manage to avoid what looks like a long frozen lake

2820
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:33,318
in the center of the forest with a series of
heavily iced-over stone ruins.

2821
02:34:33,318 --> 02:34:35,056
LAURA: Don't walk on this lake.

2822
02:34:35,056 --> 02:34:37,081
FELICIA: Oh, good call, good call.

2823
02:34:37,081 --> 02:34:41,282
MATT: You move around and in the distance you
swear you see the glimmer of some glowing entity

2824
02:34:41,282 --> 02:34:46,497
in the midst of these ruins and you manage to keep
enough of a distance. Everyone make a stealth

2825
02:34:46,497 --> 02:34:52,187
check on this. So roll a d20 and add your stealth
bonus.

2826
02:34:52,247 --> 02:34:55,338
FELICIA: Add it, or take away? Because it's
negative.

2827
02:34:55,338 --> 02:34:57,301
MATT: For you it'd be taking away from your
stealth roll.

2828
02:34:57,301 --> 02:34:58,464
FELICIA: Great, that's great.

2829
02:34:58,464 --> 02:34:59,903
SAM: Clang-clang-clang.

2830
02:34:59,903 --> 02:35:00,824
FELICIA: 11.

2831
02:35:00,824 --> 02:35:01,691
MARY: 13.

2832
02:35:01,691 --> 02:35:02,471
MATT: 13.

2833
02:35:02,471 --> 02:35:03,403
SAM: 13.

2834
02:35:03,403 --> 02:35:04,672
LAURA: 16.

2835
02:35:04,672 --> 02:35:06,700
MATT: Grog? Stealth.

2836
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:08,158
TRAVIS: Stealth is 14.

2837
02:35:08,158 --> 02:35:09,263
SAM: 13.

2838
02:35:09,263 --> 02:35:10,244
TALIESIN: 24.

2839
02:35:10,244 --> 02:35:11,220
FELICIA: 11.

2840
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:16,924
MATT: All right, so. Though clumsy in form, the
group is able to pull you far enough away where

2841
02:35:16,924 --> 02:35:21,963
they cover your bases on this, and this glowing
entity doesn't seem to take notice of your passage

2842
02:35:21,963 --> 02:35:27,498
as it slowly fades into the stone ruins once
again. You press on towards the mountain--

2843
02:35:27,498 --> 02:35:28,915
SAM: Should we go check that glowing entity out?

2844
02:35:28,915 --> 02:35:29,929
MARY: What was it?

2845
02:35:29,929 --> 02:35:32,579
FELICIA: Do I-- oh, do I know? I have an arcana,
or would it be nature, or?

2846
02:35:32,579 --> 02:35:37,245
MATT: For this, I would say go ahead and make a
religion check, actually.

2847
02:35:37,245 --> 02:35:40,488
FELICIA: Oh, good, three. I don't know, it's 11.

2848
02:35:40,488 --> 02:35:44,855
MATT: It's spooky and you don't like it.

2849
02:35:44,855 --> 02:35:46,661
FELICIA: I don't like that so let's keep going.

2850
02:35:46,661 --> 02:35:47,963
LAURA: We should avoid it.

2851
02:35:47,963 --> 02:35:49,474
SAM: Okay. If you insist.

2852
02:35:49,474 --> 02:35:56,063
MATT: Pushing forward about another hour and a half,
two hours, you eventually make it through the

2853
02:35:56,123 --> 02:36:02,955
forest, dodging a few other areas where clustered
vines and almost thick brambles begin to close off

2854
02:36:02,955 --> 02:36:08,233
portions of the passage. Without Vex's help on
this it would be a very difficult element to

2855
02:36:08,233 --> 02:36:11,840
traverse, but you manage to find areas you can cut
through, and where the weak points of these

2856
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:18,132
various interwoven nets of vinework are. You push
through until the forest comes to an end at the

2857
02:36:18,132 --> 02:36:25,379
base of a giant tree-covered mountain that is
currently coated in snow and ice. Looking about,

2858
02:36:25,379 --> 02:36:32,307
you can see that the highest spire is obscured by
the very blizzard clouds ahead. There is heavy

2859
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:39,209
snowfall in this vicinity and your vision is
semi-obscured past a certain area. Only because of

2860
02:36:39,209 --> 02:36:42,118
Vex's keen sight are you able to make out the
details of that mountain

2861
02:36:42,118 --> 02:36:44,348
disappearing into the blizzard.

2862
02:36:44,348 --> 02:36:46,310
TRAVIS: This is very much like home for me.

2863
02:36:46,310 --> 02:36:50,508
LAURA: Do we see any-- anything along the bottom,
the edge of the mountain that looks like it could

2864
02:36:50,508 --> 02:36:52,120
open into a cavern of some sort?

2865
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:55,115
MATT: There are a number of large rocks and
boulders that seem to have tumbled off the

2866
02:36:55,115 --> 02:36:58,937
mountain and embedded themselves in the ground in
sections. You do see what looks to be a cavern of

2867
02:36:58,937 --> 02:37:05,567
some kind that is in the-- at the base of this
mountain, it's about 20, 25 feet high and about 35

2868
02:37:05,567 --> 02:37:06,813
feet wide.

2869
02:37:06,813 --> 02:37:07,861
MARY: Should we maybe go in?

2870
02:37:07,861 --> 02:37:10,685
FELICIA: Does it look like we can climb the
mountain, or is it just too sheer?

2871
02:37:10,685 --> 02:37:13,663
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

2872
02:37:13,663 --> 02:37:18,839
FELICIA: Oh, good, this is my best. Oh! Nope, it's
a nine.

2873
02:37:18,839 --> 02:37:21,278
(laughter)

2874
02:37:21,278 --> 02:37:24,856
MATT: You-- you've read about mountains.

2875
02:37:24,856 --> 02:37:28,210
(laughter)

2876
02:37:28,210 --> 02:37:33,027
MATT: And you've seen many pictures of them.
Seeing one up close? They're a lot bigger than you

2877
02:37:33,027 --> 02:37:34,305
thought they'd be.

2878
02:37:34,305 --> 02:37:39,463
FELICIA: Very large mountain, guys, I'm not sure--
as a leader I'd like to invite you guys to

2879
02:37:39,463 --> 02:37:43,506
evaluate whether we could possibly climb this
mountain.

2880
02:37:43,506 --> 02:37:46,779
TALIESIN: I would like to evaluate whether or not
we could climb this mountain.

2881
02:37:46,779 --> 02:37:47,990
SAM: You're delegating, that's good.

2882
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:49,090
LAURA: Yeah, delegate.

2883
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:50,313
TRAVIS: So I'm proficient here, right?

2884
02:37:50,313 --> 02:37:51,342
LAURA: Can we check?

2885
02:37:51,342 --> 02:37:56,814
MATT: You-- I'd say for this and since you know
mountain ranges pretty well, go ahead and make a

2886
02:37:56,814 --> 02:37:59,048
wisdom check on this, yeah.

2887
02:37:59,048 --> 02:38:00,783
TRAVIS: Shit.

2888
02:38:00,783 --> 02:38:02,314
MATT: Just add your wisdom modifier to the roll.

2889
02:38:02,314 --> 02:38:04,502
TRAVIS: Which is zero. (laughs) 15.

2890
02:38:04,502 --> 02:38:09,613
MATT: 15. As you're kinda taking a moment to
inspect it, you, your people, your actual race

2891
02:38:09,613 --> 02:38:14,918
being mountain-born people, you look at it, and it
could be scaled. It would be a dangerous climb and

2892
02:38:14,918 --> 02:38:17,767
you would need some semblance of simple climbing
tools to do so.

2893
02:38:17,767 --> 02:38:20,959
TRAVIS: So we got to make it come to us.

2894
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:22,082
FELICIA: Well.

2895
02:38:22,082 --> 02:38:23,364
MARY: We could.

2896
02:38:23,364 --> 02:38:25,137
LAURA: Oh, that's smart, Grog. That's really
smart!

2897
02:38:25,137 --> 02:38:26,637
FELICIA: We have to lure the dragon down.

2898
02:38:26,637 --> 02:38:28,188
SAM: Or one of us could climb it and--

2899
02:38:28,188 --> 02:38:29,102
TRAVIS: Jump off?

2900
02:38:29,102 --> 02:38:32,516
SAM: -- bring it down as bait. I could do that.

2901
02:38:32,516 --> 02:38:34,114
FELICIA: I don't think that sounds like a good
idea. There's a cavern over there, should we

2902
02:38:34,114 --> 02:38:36,710
inspect it? Maybe there's some inner workings to
get to the top.

2903
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:40,229
TALIESIN: I think this conversation would be
greatly improved by some sort of cover.

2904
02:38:40,229 --> 02:38:42,966
LAURA: We'll get into cover maybe just to be
safe.

2905
02:38:42,966 --> 02:38:44,815
MARY: I agree, I vote on going to investigate the
cavern.

2906
02:38:44,815 --> 02:38:48,092
FELICIA: Let's go to the cavern. Well, it's not a
democracy, but that's okay, I am totally open--

2907
02:38:48,092 --> 02:38:49,320
MARY: And I agree with your--

2908
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:53,239
MATT: You hear this heavy sound of wind rushing
suddenly.

2909
02:38:53,239 --> 02:38:54,618
FELICIA: Oh god, get in the cavern, get in the
cavern! Get in the cavern!

2910
02:38:54,618 --> 02:38:55,779
TALIESIN: Cavern now!

2911
02:38:55,779 --> 02:39:05,852
MATT: Let's see. Oof. Okay. (laughs) Vex. On
horseback, you look over, and the snow that's

2912
02:39:05,852 --> 02:39:12,434
hitting your face-- you see a dark shape begin to
form in the snow. It gets larger and larger and

2913
02:39:12,434 --> 02:39:15,531
larger, and you realize it's not something that's
swelling or growing, it's something that's coming

2914
02:39:15,531 --> 02:39:19,824
at you very fast and it's very large. You
immediately try and turn your horse around, but

2915
02:39:19,824 --> 02:39:24,615
it's too fast, and it slams into the side of you,
sending you off the horse and tumbling to the

2916
02:39:24,615 --> 02:39:29,080
ground. You feel a heated pain in your side you
haven't felt in a long time from the impact.

2917
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:30,411
LAURA: Ah! What?

2918
02:39:30,411 --> 02:39:34,099
MATT: You guys watch as a boulder about that big,
of rock and ice--

2919
02:39:34,099 --> 02:39:35,168
SAM: Oh, shit.

2920
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,691
MATT: -- just smacks into the side of you.

2921
02:39:36,691 --> 02:39:37,663
SAM: Oh, shit.

2922
02:39:37,663 --> 02:39:40,160
LAURA: You're kidding me, right? That sucked.

2923
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:41,733
MARY: Where did it come from?

2924
02:39:41,733 --> 02:39:43,411
SAM: It was just a random meteor.

2925
02:39:43,411 --> 02:39:45,067
MATT: You take 30 points of bludgeoning damage.

2926
02:39:45,067 --> 02:39:46,387
LAURA: You're kidding me!

2927
02:39:46,387 --> 02:39:47,407
FELICIA: What the--

2928
02:39:47,407 --> 02:39:48,372
MARY: Wow!

2929
02:39:48,372 --> 02:39:49,545
MATT: And you're knocked onto the ground.

2930
02:39:49,545 --> 02:39:50,756
FELICIA: Oh my god, Vex! (screams)

2931
02:39:50,756 --> 02:39:53,436
MATT: The rest of you, who are currently on
horseback, see this, and from the direction of the

2932
02:39:53,436 --> 02:39:58,717
forest you see a large, very large humanoid figure
begin to step out of the edge of the forest.

2933
02:39:58,717 --> 02:40:01,023
LAURA: It's a giant? Oh, no.

2934
02:40:01,023 --> 02:40:08,539
MATT: This low voice kind of
bellows out. You can see on it thick, snow-covered

2935
02:40:08,539 --> 02:40:15,018
fur, patchwork hide armor. The skin itself is a
dull bluish-grey in color, white eyes, a giant

2936
02:40:15,018 --> 02:40:19,224
metallic horn, what looks like some sort of
creature's horns that are affixed to the sides of

2937
02:40:19,276 --> 02:40:24,527
its helmet. A giant axe in its hand. This is
indeed-- and you recognize it immediately-- this

2938
02:40:24,527 --> 02:40:32,288
is a frost giant. You see it reach down
and grab another boulder and begin to toss it in its

2939
02:40:32,441 --> 02:40:35,896
hand. As the rest of you see this, you hear
another bellow.

2940
02:40:35,896 --> 02:40:37,298
LAURA: You speak Giant, you speak Giant, right?

2941
02:40:37,298 --> 02:40:38,373
MATT: Does anyone speak Giant here?

2942
02:40:38,373 --> 02:40:39,403
TRAVIS: I do.

2943
02:40:39,403 --> 02:40:42,887
MATT: You hear a voice come echoing from the
cavern behind you, saying, "Intruder!

2944
02:40:42,887 --> 02:40:44,792
"Take him down!"

2945
02:40:44,792 --> 02:40:46,375
LAURA: Oh no, no no!

2946
02:40:46,424 --> 02:40:47,538
SAM: What do we do, guys?

2947
02:40:47,538 --> 02:40:48,694
MARY: Talk to him, for--

2948
02:40:48,694 --> 02:40:50,051
MATT: A second frost giant steps out of the cavern
behind you.

2949
02:40:50,051 --> 02:40:50,796
LAURA: Shit.

2950
02:40:50,796 --> 02:40:52,449
MATT: And that's where we're going to go ahead and
end the session for today.

2951
02:40:52,449 --> 02:40:54,159
(yelling)

2952
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:55,795
SAM: We're in between two giants and a dragon?

2953
02:40:55,795 --> 02:40:56,708
FELICIA: Without--

2954
02:40:56,708 --> 02:40:58,309
MARY: Hagawaga... hawafenor!

2955
02:40:58,309 --> 02:40:59,484
LAURA: I'm damaged.

2956
02:40:59,484 --> 02:41:00,527
FELICIA: Very damaged.

2957
02:41:00,527 --> 02:41:01,448
MARY: She's damaged.

2958
02:41:01,448 --> 02:41:03,410
MATT: Yes, on the ground. You marked your damage,
because that carries over to next week.

2959
02:41:03,410 --> 02:41:04,499
LAURA: I did.

2960
02:41:04,499 --> 02:41:08,710
MATT: All right, guys, we'll-- because I know you
had to leave soon and that would be a good place

2961
02:41:08,710 --> 02:41:12,347
to stop it for this point and this week, we're
going to continue this session next week.

2962
02:41:12,347 --> 02:41:13,404
TRAVIS: We're screwed!

2963
02:41:13,404 --> 02:41:14,619
MARY: No we're not!

2964
02:41:14,619 --> 02:41:15,554
LAURA: I'm dead!

2965
02:41:15,554 --> 02:41:16,612
MARY: No we're not.

2966
02:41:16,612 --> 02:41:18,296
MATT: Starting a battle with two delightful frost
giants.

2967
02:41:18,296 --> 02:41:19,949
LAURA: I feel like we did such a good job on the
last one.

2968
02:41:19,949 --> 02:41:21,008
TRAVIS: Two giants!

2969
02:41:21,008 --> 02:41:22,317
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2970
02:41:22,317 --> 02:41:23,514
MARY: All right.

2971
02:41:23,514 --> 02:41:26,001
MATT: So first off, guys. Welcome to Critical
Role, Mary.

2972
02:41:26,001 --> 02:41:27,653
(cheering)

2973
02:41:27,653 --> 02:41:31,283
MARY: Thank you so much. It was such a bloody
delight.

2974
02:41:31,283 --> 02:41:33,001
LAURA: You have to be careful with my dice.

2975
02:41:33,001 --> 02:41:34,047
SAM: Do they break?

2976
02:41:34,047 --> 02:41:35,306
MATT: Very, very well done.

2977
02:41:35,306 --> 02:41:36,412
LAURA: I've got gems in here.

2978
02:41:36,412 --> 02:41:37,478
MARY: I hope we'll survive.

2979
02:41:37,478 --> 02:41:38,491
FELICIA: You never know.

2980
02:41:38,491 --> 02:41:41,169
SAM: Wow, that was amazing. Mary and Felicia are
so good.

2981
02:41:41,169 --> 02:41:42,246
MARY: Thank you.

2982
02:41:42,246 --> 02:41:43,269
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

2983
02:41:43,269 --> 02:41:44,133
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2984
02:41:44,133 --> 02:41:45,503
SAM: So talented. You killed people and stuff.

2985
02:41:45,503 --> 02:41:46,379
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

2986
02:41:46,379 --> 02:41:48,198
MARY: I mended a piece of paper.

2987
02:41:48,198 --> 02:41:50,062
LAURA: You did! And you--

2988
02:41:50,062 --> 02:41:51,912
MATT: Blasted the torso out of an orc.

2989
02:41:51,912 --> 02:41:52,930
MARY: And I killed an orc--

2990
02:41:52,930 --> 02:41:56,525
LAURA: And you made a guy like give us things for
super cheap, which is like

2991
02:41:56,525 --> 02:41:57,701
the best thing in the world.

2992
02:41:57,701 --> 02:41:59,200
MARY: I love a good sale, I do.

2993
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:00,283
LAURA: I do too!

2994
02:42:00,283 --> 02:42:03,115
MARY: I love finding a bargain. We should
definitely go shopping.

2995
02:42:03,115 --> 02:42:07,708
FELICIA: Oh, I'm fine with it. I'm fine with my
trust fund, because my parents are dead, yay.

2996
02:42:07,708 --> 02:42:09,069
MATT: All right, we have our--

2997
02:42:09,069 --> 02:42:12,487
ZAC: We have some donations to go through, so
guys, just like last week because we're getting so

2998
02:42:12,487 --> 02:42:17,030
many donations we just don't have time to read all
the messages, so we'll just read off who the

2999
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:23,173
donation was from and say thank you, and then I
will send an exported list with all your messages

3000
02:42:23,173 --> 02:42:28,516
in an e-mail form to all of our hosts so they can
see them. But it's just so many,

3001
02:42:28,516 --> 02:42:29,773
which is amazing.

3002
02:42:29,773 --> 02:42:30,635
LAURA: Yay!

3003
02:42:30,635 --> 02:42:31,744
MATT: You guys are ridiculous.

3004
02:42:31,744 --> 02:42:32,790
TRAVIS: Yeah. You guys are rad.

3005
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:34,757
ZAC: We just don't have all night to go through
them. Oh, can I make a personal request?

3006
02:42:34,757 --> 02:42:35,472
MATT: Sure.

3007
02:42:35,472 --> 02:42:36,701
ZAC: Can you kill Felicia next week?

3008
02:42:36,701 --> 02:42:38,098
MATT: That's not up to me.

3009
02:42:38,098 --> 02:42:39,477
LAURA: That's just not appropriate.

3010
02:42:39,477 --> 02:42:40,665
FELICIA: What's that about?

3011
02:42:40,665 --> 02:42:42,047
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow.

3012
02:42:42,047 --> 02:42:42,963
MATT: That's really unnecess--

tomorrow's show. Tomorrow we are having a new show

lock, and he challenged anyone

3115
02:47:12,609 --> 02:47:14,156
to try to beat him, so.

3116
02:47:14,156 --> 02:47:16,505
MATT: By the way, I would watch that movie in a
second.

3117
02:47:16,505 --> 02:47:17,204
ZAC: Right?

3118

excited. And then after that--

3120

community, what you guys do for each other, the
support you guys have in playing together and

3127
02:47:51,056 --> 02:47:57,726
supporting each other is incredible and I-- every
week we're perpetually blown away and feeling

3128
02:47:57,726 --> 02:48:01,166
unworthy for all the gifts you send, and it's
amazing.

3129
02:48:01,166 --> 02:48:02,624
TRAVIS: Get out of my seat!

3130
02:48:02,624 --> 02:48:08,834

both the set and our living spaces now with all

baby.

02:48:24,825 --> 02:48:25,893

LIAM: Is that your woobie?

3139
02:48:29,577 --> 02:48:31,085
TALIESIN: Hey now. That's not nice.

3140
02:48:31,085 --> 02:48:32,561
TRAVIS: Grog's ale, keep away from giants.

3141
02:48:32,561 --> 02:48:37,450
MATT: Hey congratulations chat room, by the way,

3143
02:48:40,793 --> 02:48:41,956
TRAVIS: They chose that shit?

3144
02:48:41,956 --> 02:48:45,595
FELICIA: Wait, what? They picked the harder one
for us? Thanks, guys.

3145
02:48:45,595 --> 02:48:47,541
TRAVIS: We love you guys. It's not like we want to
live or anything.

3146
02:48:47,541 --> 02:48:49,345
FELICIA: You want Lyra to die, that's what you
want.

3147
02:48:49,345 --> 02:48:51,092

3148
02:48:51,092 --> 02:48:52,959

3149
02:48:52,959 --> 02:48:55,245

know-- I don't know, goblins

3151
02:48:59,590 --> 02:49:02,156
or like really angry dogs?

3152
02:49:02,156 --> 02:49:04,423
MARY: When you see what we do to orcs.

3153
02:49:04,423 --> 02:49:09,097
ORION: I don't know what would be worse, a dragon
or a beholder.

3154
02:49:09,097 --> 02:49:12,234
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm thinking of that. That instant
death-ray.

3155
02:49:12,234 --> 02:49:13,751
FELICIA: Thank you!

3156
02:49:13,751 --> 02:49:19,160
They all are Critical Role dice, which is
pretty amazing.

3157
02:49:19,208 --> 02:49:22,260
MARY: Yes! That's awesome!

3158
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:27,040
MATT: All right, guys, real fast we'll get to
these gifts here--, we have a few gifts to open for

3159
02:49:27,193 --> 02:49:40,357
the group here, from a Vincent Langolas. Open
this. Oh yeah!

3160
02:49:40,357 --> 02:49:44,903
SAM: Are they in the box of holding, there in the
box? Somewhere.

3161
02:49:44,903 --> 02:49:47,089
MATT: So, guys, for those who don't know, Vincent
has been--

3162
02:49:47,089 --> 02:49:48,014
SAM: Oh my god.

3163
02:49:48,014 --> 02:49:54,335
MATT: --progressively pumping out amazing episodic
fanfiction of Vox Machina, and sending us all of

3164
02:49:54,335 --> 02:49:58,896
it, the stories are really really awesome. If you
are inclined to, I recommend if you haven't

3165
02:49:58,896 --> 02:50:01,436
already put them online, then share them with the
rest of the Critter community,

3166
02:50:01,436 --> 02:50:02,883
they're really awesome.

3167
02:50:02,883 --> 02:50:06,622
FELICIA: There's a place called wattpad.com where
you-- a lot of people do post fanfic.

3168
02:50:06,622 --> 02:50:07,626
MATT: Oh, awesome.

3169
02:50:07,626 --> 02:50:12,710
FELICIA: I actually am on there for my book, it's
promotion, but when I started poking around there

3170
02:50:12,710 --> 02:50:17,744
was lots of fanfic, a lot of Supernatural fans
around there writing fiction. But like, it could

3171
02:50:17,744 --> 02:50:19,536
be a place that people could post.

3172
02:50:19,536 --> 02:50:21,617
LIAM: Have you written any?

3173
02:50:21,617 --> 02:50:26,855
FELICIA: Not yet, but I do want to. I have to
pick, it might be just Nancy Drew fanfic,

3174
02:50:26,855 --> 02:50:28,038
I'm not sure.

3175
02:50:28,038 --> 02:50:32,979
MATT: Well, I have Vax and Vex's copies here, I'll
get these both to you, Liam, to handle there.

3176
02:50:32,979 --> 02:50:34,859
SAM: One Dwarf Too Many.

3177
02:50:34,859 --> 02:50:37,416
MATT: I'll hold on to Pike's, Ashley's currently
absent, but we'll--

3178
02:50:37,416 --> 02:50:38,933
TALIESIN: This is chapter three?

3179
02:50:38,933 --> 02:50:41,439
MATT: Actually, why don't you hand these out, if
you could, thank you so much. This is the next

3180
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:44,459
chapter in the One Dwarf Too Many saga.

3181
02:50:44,459 --> 02:50:45,891
SAM: One Dwarf Too Many.

3182
02:50:45,891 --> 02:50:47,225
MATT: One Dwarf Too Many.

3183
02:50:47,225 --> 02:50:49,609
SAM: As read by Sir Ian McKellen.

3184
02:50:49,609 --> 02:50:50,984
LIAM: Here's Percival's.

3185
02:50:50,984 --> 02:50:52,143
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3186
02:50:52,143 --> 02:50:53,346
MATT: That is awesome.

3187
02:50:53,346 --> 02:51:01,491
TALIESIN: I need to get these bound at some point.
I feel like I don't work hard enough every time

3188
02:51:01,491 --> 02:51:03,066
one of these comes.

3189
02:51:03,066 --> 02:51:12,615
MATT: All right, so from Joe, aka jockguy89 to
Matt Mercer, "Epic dungeon master

3190
02:51:12,615 --> 02:51:14,240
"needs an epic d20."

3191
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:15,620
MARISHA: Oh snap!

3192
02:51:15,620 --> 02:51:17,381
SAM: It's made of dice.

3193
02:51:17,381 --> 02:51:19,015
TALIESIN: It's gonna be an engagement d20.

3194
02:51:19,015 --> 02:51:23,269
MATT: Oh, oh I get my own flashing d20 now.

3195
02:51:23,269 --> 02:51:24,501
FELICIA: Is it flashing?

3196
02:51:24,501 --> 02:51:25,635
MARISHA: Is that what it is?

3197
02:51:25,635 --> 02:51:27,222
(cheering)

3198
02:51:27,222 --> 02:51:30,581
MATT: I've seen these, I've seen these, I wanted
one. This is one that if it lands on a 20, it

3199
02:51:30,632 --> 02:51:32,578
flashes a bunch of LEDs on the inside.

3200
02:51:32,578 --> 02:51:34,670
TALIESIN: It gives you an alarm when you know he's
gonna kill a party member.

3201
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:38,834
MATT: It's like this red glow beneath the shield,
I just kinda look up silently. It's going to be

3202
02:51:38,834 --> 02:51:45,742
great. Thank you so much, Joe, that's really
really sweet. I'm going to use that. Here we have

3203
02:51:45,742 --> 02:51:54,786
a letter. All right, Sir Drey, about 21
hours ago, block. "Hello there, Critical Role, my

3204
02:51:54,835 --> 02:51:57,808
"name is Drey, and my friends and I have created
our own Pathfinder D&amp;D group after religiously

3205
02:51:57,808 --> 02:52:02,383
"watching the show every Thursday." Awesome! "We
used Tabletop in which I purchased a battlemap,

3206
02:52:02,383 --> 02:52:05,764
"but we have really old metal figurines, I was
wondering if by chance you could point us in the

3207
02:52:05,764 --> 02:52:08,985
"direction of where to get better figurines? I've
checked Amazon and a few other comic stores and

3208
02:52:08,985 --> 02:52:11,391
"couldn't find any miniatures. It'd be really a big
help if you could point me in the right direction.

3209
02:52:11,391 --> 02:52:14,502
"I know you might not answer back due to busy
schedules, but thank you guys for putting on the

3210
02:52:14,502 --> 02:52:19,394
"show and entertaining us Critters. Sincerely,
Drey." Thank you, Drey. A lot of these minis come

3211
02:52:19,394 --> 02:52:25,974
from-- if you can't find it at comic stores nearby
there's good websites like Miniature, I think it's

3212
02:52:25,974 --> 02:52:31,258
Miniature Market. There is--Troll and Toad is one
of my mainstays, Troll and Toad has a good

3213
02:52:31,258 --> 02:52:34,318
selection of minis you can order. eBay is also a
good source.

3214
02:52:34,318 --> 02:52:35,700
TALIESIN: Hero Forge.

3215
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:39,296
MATT: Hero Forge, you can customize your own
character minis, which is really great, and have

3216
02:52:39,296 --> 02:52:47,488
them 3D printed out for you. And then, there
is.... You can order on Amazon some of the packs

3217
02:52:47,488 --> 02:52:52,301
of D&amp;D figures. You don't know what's in there,
it's one of those kinda you know surprise figure

3218
02:52:52,301 --> 02:52:56,438
boxes, which is kinda fun in itself. I've bought
way too many of those. But you can find those on

3219
02:52:56,438 --> 02:53:00,200
Amazon, usually. Just look for Dungeons and
Dragons miniature boxes and Pathfinder boxes as

3220
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:03,388
well, they have a whole slew of that, so. Those
would be your best bets.

3221
02:53:03,388 --> 02:53:05,851
MARISHA: They're like miniature grab bags.

3222
02:53:05,851 --> 02:53:14,005
MATT: Apparently. Oh, what? All right. "Matt, can
read on air." And then I can read that off the air.

3223
02:53:14,005 --> 02:53:21,587
That's the private conversation. Here we go, this
is filled with money! No, it's not. It's my

3224
02:53:21,587 --> 02:53:24,055
favorite fan.

3225
02:53:24,055 --> 02:53:25,811
MARY: It's a check!

3226
02:53:25,811 --> 02:53:31,295
MATT: I want to take a moment to say, I appreciate
that most of our letters we get are hand-written,

3227
02:53:31,346 --> 02:53:37,651
and that is such a rarity these days and it kinda
makes this little archaic happiness in my heart

3228
02:53:37,651 --> 02:53:42,825
sprout. So, "Matt, so far from my experience, DMs
typically have a ton of dice, so I thought why not

3229
02:53:42,825 --> 02:53:48,206
"make a little bug to help with the struggle." Bag!
Bag to help with the struggle. Oh. Read that

3230
02:53:48,206 --> 02:53:51,640
'bug'. I'm also bad at writing hand, reading
handwriting. I love handwritten letters, I'm just

3231
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:52,853
terrible at them, I apologize.

3232
02:53:52,853 --> 02:53:55,047
MARISHA: I got really excited, I thought it was
gonna be like a dice bug.

3233
02:53:55,047 --> 02:53:58,347
MATT: Right, or just like a whole bunch of roaches
start pouring out, I'm like, this was a great

3234
02:53:58,347 --> 02:54:09,410
idea. (screams) "I made one for everyone but
started to run out of materials and only sent this

3235
02:54:09,410 --> 02:54:17,134
"one out. Hope you enjoy the candy inside." Ooh.
"Let's really hope it doesn't melt. Sorry if it

3236
02:54:17,134 --> 02:54:19,484
"does. Rebecca Christian." Thank you so much,
Rebecca! That's really sweet. What did Rebecca--

3237
02:54:19,484 --> 02:54:24,436
Oh! That is-- that is a chainmail dice bag.

3238
02:54:24,436 --> 02:54:25,908
ALL: Whoa!

3239
02:54:25,908 --> 02:54:28,420
MATT: That says DM on it in gold chains.

3240
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:31,350
(cheering)

3241
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:36,369
FELICIA: That's really hard to make, chainmail. It
really takes a long time.

3242
02:54:36,369 --> 02:54:37,415
MARISHA: Takes forever.

3243
02:54:37,415 --> 02:54:38,432
FELICIA: Yeah, takes forever.

3244
02:54:38,432 --> 02:54:42,829
MATT: It's full of coins. Let's share some gold
coins.

3245
02:54:42,829 --> 02:54:44,823
(cheering)

3246
02:54:44,823 --> 02:54:46,029
MATT: Catch?

3247
02:54:46,029 --> 02:54:47,014
FELICIA: No, no!

3248
02:54:47,014 --> 02:54:48,247
TRAVIS: Throw it at her!

3249
02:54:48,247 --> 02:54:49,916
ORION: Actually, just throw them all to Sam.

3250
02:54:49,916 --> 02:54:53,882
MATT: There you go. Sam! There you go.

3251
02:54:53,882 --> 02:54:58,551
ORION: Hey Matthew?

3252
02:54:58,551 --> 02:55:00,074
MATT: Also acts as a bag protector.

3253
02:55:00,074 --> 02:55:01,424
ORION: Nice sack.

3254
02:55:01,424 --> 02:55:09,542
MATT: Thank you. Oh my god, you guys are so sweet,
thank you so much. That's awesome. And then did we

3255
02:55:09,542 --> 02:55:13,700
find out who these are for? Ryan? Ryan?

3256
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:14,815
RYAN: Yes?

3257
02:55:14,815 --> 02:55:16,164
MATT: Did you find out who these are for?

3258
02:55:16,164 --> 02:55:18,125
RYAN: Those are for you to distribute, they're
from jpcguy.

3259
02:55:18,125 --> 02:55:24,099
MATT: Jpcguy! Awesome, thank you so much! We got
two sets of elven dice to distribute here amongst

3260
02:55:24,099 --> 02:55:25,582
the party. Oh, these are really cool.

3261
02:55:25,582 --> 02:55:27,277
TRAVIS: I got dwarvish dice to distribute, too.

3262
02:55:27,277 --> 02:55:30,579
ORION: I already got a set, jpcguy already gave me
one, so I'm good.

3263
02:55:30,579 --> 02:55:35,284
MATT: Awesome. Thank you so much, that's amazing.

3264
02:55:35,284 --> 02:55:40,270
TRAVIS: These were from Eric, redzanwatt, "Grog,
thank you to all Critical Role for the joy you

3265
02:55:40,270 --> 02:55:43,457
"bring me and showing me the amazing world of D&amp;D.
These dice would fit in nice with the dwarf beard

3266
02:55:43,457 --> 02:55:48,331
"I hope you finally grow. Your fan, Eric." Very
cool, Eric. Thank you, man.

3267
02:55:48,331 --> 02:55:49,932
FELICIA: When are you gonna grow hair, Grog?

3268
02:55:49,932 --> 02:55:57,487
MATT: The dice pool we've slowly gathered over
this time. So, not to worry.

3269
02:55:57,487 --> 02:56:00,811
TRAVIS: Can I show this off real quick?

3270
02:56:00,811 --> 02:56:01,833
MATT: Yeah?

3271
02:56:01,833 --> 02:56:05,723
TRAVIS: So I'm a crazy Dallas Cowboys fan and
somebody sent me an autographed picture of the

3272
02:56:05,723 --> 02:56:09,895
original three, like, Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin
and Emmitt Smith.

3273
02:56:09,895 --> 02:56:11,168
ALL: What?!

3274
02:56:11,168 --> 02:56:13,581
MATT: I don't know who those are but I'm so happy
for you!

3275
02:56:13,581 --> 02:56:18,433
TRAVIS: It's instantly going on my wall next to my
Dallas Cowboys--

3276
02:56:18,433 --> 02:56:24,426
ORION: I don't watch sports, but I know these
names because that's when I used to watch sports,

3277
02:56:24,426 --> 02:56:25,810
and those are cool names.

3278
02:56:25,810 --> 02:56:28,476
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you thank you, I don't
know, the Cowboys are my team.

3279
02:56:28,476 --> 02:56:30,401
ORION: That is ace.

3280
02:56:30,401 --> 02:56:39,236
TRAVIS: It just came from Nostalgic, I don't even
know! Who sent it? It gave me this!

3281
02:56:39,236 --> 02:56:42,234
MARY: Nostalgic in Ohio.

3282
02:56:42,234 --> 02:56:44,210
MARISHA: Thanks, nostalgic.

3283
02:56:44,210 --> 02:56:45,503
FELICIA: In Ohio.

3284
02:56:45,503 --> 02:56:49,477
SAM: Wow, for a fan of the Cowboys to get that,
that's amazing!

3285
02:56:49,477 --> 02:56:51,042
FELICIA: How did they know that?

3286
02:56:51,042 --> 02:56:52,243
TRAVIS: Internet?

3287
02:56:52,243 --> 02:57:03,967
SAM: I am a fan of obscure Picasso art. And
sketches. Maybe Hundertwasser sketches, or

3288
02:57:03,967 --> 02:57:04,979
something.

3289
02:57:04,979 --> 02:57:06,366
(laughter)

3290
02:57:06,366 --> 02:57:08,440
LIAM: You're human? You can have these.

3291
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:10,426
FELICIA: Oh yay! Oh, these are beautiful.

3292
02:57:10,426 --> 02:57:11,508
TALIESIN: These are fabulous.

3293
02:57:11,508 --> 02:57:12,514

the DX15 campaign." Which is the Deus Ex campaign

3299
02:57:37,458 --> 02:57:43,399

and Jim Carroll." Flipside-- Oh, Zac, pay

3305
02:58:15,009 --> 02:58:22,178
attention. "We bought Final Fantasy Type 0 for a
giveaway during the Deus Ex thing, but never got a

"chance to promote it. So we would like to offer it
to you and the team members could give it away to
