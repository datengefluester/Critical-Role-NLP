1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:04,638
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:13,461
nerdy-ass voi-- (gibberish) voice actors. It's
been a long year, a lot of us voice actors-- Look,

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,822
there's very high nerves in the studio right now
'cause tonight's going to be crazy. A bunch of us

4
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:21,226
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Tonight's going to be an

5
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:26,339
intense episode but before we get to that, let's
go ahead and get through our announcements for the

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:32,031
evening. First and foremost, we have an amazing
sponsor tonight. We have Backblaze.

7
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,870
(cheering)

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,665
LAURA: We love you, Yev!

9
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:40,225
MATT: Our final episode of the year. So Sam, you
have a few words on that?

10
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:44,911
SAM: Yeah well, you know Backblaze is unlimited
cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month.

11
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:52,675
You can go to backblaze.com/criticalrole for a
full 15-day free trial, and I was going through my

12
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,516
library. You know I have a whole library?

13
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:57,303
MATT: It's pretty impressive, actually.

14
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:03,965
SAM: Yeah and I dug up an old poetry book and
buried inside there was a very curious poem by a

15
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,459
young Dr. Seuss.

16
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,043
TRAVIS: Oh really?

17
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:09,617
SAM: Yeah.

18
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:10,929
MATT: That's worth a lot of money.

19
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,253
SAM: I know, I know. I thought I would read it for
you all today.

20
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:15,014
TRAVIS: Doesn't even look yellowed or anything.

21
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,176
SAM: He printed it on his laser printer.

22
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,168
TRAVIS: Oh good.

23
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:19,657
(laughter)

24
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:25,838
SAM: But it happens to concern Backblaze. The
drive did not spin. It just clacked and it

25
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:31,891
clicked. I rebooted and prayed and gave it a swift
kick. But my data was gone, poof, every byte and

26
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:37,959
bit. And I cried, "How I wish I had backed up my
shit!" But who should appear in a car that he

27
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:45,205
revved? A zingity zangity furry red Yev. The Yev
jumped through my window, he pounced on my mouse

28
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:50,417
and said, "You must have wished Backblaze to your
house." But I looked at him cross, shouting, "What

29
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:55,783
"do you mean? My files are corrupt. This is one
dead machine." He just laughed and said, "You daft

30
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:02,779
"binkle blot, Backblaze works whether you remember
or not. Your pics of your kids and the food that they

31
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:09,255
"eated, all stored on the cloud. Nothing's ever
deleted. Your docs, Firefox, alarm clocks, and

32
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:14,849
"your socks will all be restored from our miracle
box." The Yev yelled, "Don't worry from midnight

33
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:23,064
"to morn, we save all your stuff, your taxes and
porn. Your music and apps are safe on Backblaze."

34
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:28,635
And with that, the Yev tipped his hat, "Good day."
So remember, go visit backblaze.com and find the

35
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:34,019
red Yev sing-singing his song. Let them take care
of you heart and soul and tell him you're sent

36
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,203
there by Critical Role.

37
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:41,356
TRAVIS: Damn! Man, I don't know if that was Dr.
Seuss or Lin-Manuel but that was great.

38
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:50,788
LIAM: It was sweet and offensive. By the way, Sam,
that's a very handsome hoodie you're wearing. I

39
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,318
can't wait to open you up like an advent calendar
later.

40
00:02:53,318 --> 00:03:02,280
SAM: Oh! There's nothing offensive to Matt Mercer
under this shirt. It's just another shirt

41
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,261
progression to inspire us. This one goes four
deep.

42
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,509
(yelling)

43
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:13,303
LAURA: It looks like your tiny little weenus is--

44
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:16,451
TRAVIS: You're shirt-cocking your own mouth!

45
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,338
MATT: I am so happy!

46
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:32,160
SAM: It's to inspire us in our final fights. It
might be the last time I'm ever on this show, so I

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,460
wanted it to be five of me.

48
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:40,435
MATT: For the power of five Sams. Thank you, Sam,
and thank you, Backblaze, for being our awesome

49
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:44,296
sponsor for our episode tonight. You guys are
awesome. We have a great video for you to watch

50
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,823
from them at the break.

51
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:51,257
LAURA: Wait. Can I say, Yev, about the stuff? All
the little pictures you see in the different

52
00:03:51,257 --> 00:04:00,059
videos, he's giving some of those away tonight?
Giving some away! If you sign up for Backblaze or

53
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:04,553
if you have signed up for Backblaze already,
you're entered into the competition. And then you

54
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:09,345
can win them, and we've signed them, and it's
wonderful. Did I say it right?

55
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,476
SAM: Yep, you did great.

56
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:11,532
LAURA: Okay. Cool.

57
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:18,063
MATT: It was pretty bad. As a quick addendum,
while they're not officially sponsoring the show

58
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:21,965
tonight, our friends at Loot Crate, who sponsored
us for a large portion of the year as well, wanted

59
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:26,140
us to give you a heads up about their current Halo
Legendary crate. It's filled with a bunch of

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,033
exclusive Halo figures, collectibles and in-game
items. If you're a Halo fan, this has some

61
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,709
exclusive stuff that comes through Loot Crate in
that specific crate. You can go to

62
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,789
lootcrate.com/LDNHalo to check it out. You can use
the code "LDNHalo," all one word, for a

63
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:46,374
discount to that. The cutoff for orders is
tonight, so if you plan to do that, you might want

64
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:51,830
to check it out in the next couple of hours. Now's
your chance to do it, go. Do it, it's awesome.

65
00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:01,253
Right. That's our sponsorship. Couple of other
things to mention. We will be returning January

66
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:08,175
5th, will be our returning episode in 2017. The
new year. We'll pick up wherever tonight leaves off.

67
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,360
LIAM: Those characters are going to be awesome.

68
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:18,079
MATT: You have so much faith in yourselves! It's
very possible. No. So yeah, we'll be back January

69
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,917
5th. We wish you guys a very very merry holiday,
in all your celebrations, and your families, and

70
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,920
your New Year's, and all that crazy stuff. We'll
have more of that at the end of the episode, but

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,694
we'll see you back then. We have a merch
shout-out, actually. Laura, if you want to talk

72
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,629
about what we have up on the store for them?

73
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:41,252
LAURA: That's a good question. I have no idea
what's in the store tonight. I have no sheet in

74
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:45,257
front of me, and I have no idea what's there. I
think there's some hats left, I know there are

75
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,355
some hats--

76
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:47,743
TRAVIS: The dice got restocked.

77
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:51,298
LAURA: No, they did not. No, the dice did not get
restocked, the dice are coming back in, like,

78
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:56,995
January, so there's a lot more coming in January,
so that's good. I have no idea what else is in the

79
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:59,144
store though. A hat? There's a hat.

80
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,038
MATT: There you go.

81
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:02,677
LAURA: Shit, I got nothing.

82
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:04,340
SAM: You are the best.

83
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,542
LAURA: You guys, I'm focused on spells, and I'm
focused on arrows, and hit points and-- (gasps)

84
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:17,032
And the patches! And our mugs!

85
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:21,908
MATT: If you go to the Geek and Sundry store under
Critical Role, you'll see merch! That's our

86
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:25,021
announcement for the evening!

87
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:33,654
LAURA: There's still patches left, you guys!
That's pretty cool! Yeah, the hats are still

88
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:37,422
there. There's only a few left, though! There's
only a few hats left, I know that for sure.

89
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,844
MARISHA: Only a few hats left.

90
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:41,545
MARISHA and TALIESIN: And they're gone.

91
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:43,871
LAURA: Sorry. I'm stressed!

92
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:49,347
MARISHA: Yes, tomorrow we have a last-minute
special edition Signal Boost episode that is a

93
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:55,095
stocking stuffer edition. Yeah, coming out
tomorrow, and it's got, like, coupons in it, so

94
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:59,651
you should watch it. And also: everyone likes
coupons!

95
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,510
TALIESIN: That's true.

96
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,961
MARISHA: End of statement. Also, there was a
playlist that we put out that is a collection of

97
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,915
all of the artists that we have boosted over the
year.

98
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,346
TALIESIN: Except one.

99
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:17,196
MARISHA: Except for one because they're not on
Spotify and it's not my fault. But yeah, go check

100
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:21,562
it out and I also wrote a little thing giving some
insight into the background of the show.

101
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,357
MATT: It's a great write-up, I recommend you guys
check it out. Even if you haven't watched Signal

102
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,555
Boost, it's a great write-up. I recommend it.
Thank you, Marisha.

103
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:35,011
MARISHA: You're welcome. I'll be here all week.
Yeah, not really, it's Christmas time.

104
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:41,537
MATT: This is a pretty cool announcement. After a
back and forth for the past year, we just got

105
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:47,347
approval from Blizzard Entertainment to
incorporate their music from their game projects

106
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,920
into our Critical Role soundtrack.

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,212
SAM: For the final fight?

108
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:54,003
MATT: I've incorporated a few tracks for tonight's
battle, as well as a couple of community-made

109
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:59,246
tracks that have been submitted over time, so
we'll have some fresh tracks for the evening. But,

110
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,935
Blizzard, thank you so much, thank you to Woody
Day, and a bunch of the guys who have helped out

111
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:06,639
over there to make this happen. We're excited to
include those amazing soundtracks into our

112
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,954
atmospheric background tracks in future episodes.

113
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:16,290
LIAM: I was not prepared. Oh! I'm fired, aren't
I?

114
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,392
MATT: Yeah, you are. Anything else anyone wants to
mention real fast?

115
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:21,830
BRIAN: (distantly) Critmas!

116
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,783
MATT: Oh yes. (laughing) Thank you, disembodied
voice of Brian Wayne Foster, ghost of Christmas

117
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:33,634
Tuesday. Next Tuesday we have a special Critmas
episode of Talks Machina. A bunch of us are

118
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:38,233
opening your awesome Critmas presents, and we'll
be showing the videos the community submitted

119
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:43,101
about what Critical Role means to them, to you,
and to us! So check it out next Tuesday in the

120
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:54,078
usual spot. I think that's it. All right, cool!
Then let us go ahead and bring the tension up as

121
00:08:54,078 --> 00:09:01,990
you guys wander into the flaming core of Emon to
show down with Thordak, the Cinder King, on

122
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,491
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

123
00:09:05,491 --> 00:10:37,391
[dramatic music]

124
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:46,456
MATT: Welcome back. So! Last we left off, Vox
Machina, after spending the better part of a

125
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:51,721
number of months traversing the Prime Material
Plane and planes beyond in search of ancient

126
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:57,382
relics known as the Vestiges of Divergence, they
finally increased their abilities, they've made

127
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:04,377
allies, and they've begun their trek to tear down
the collection of evil chromatic dragons known as

128
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:09,603
the Chroma Conclave that destroyed your city of
Emon and took over most of the continent of

129
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:17,855
Tal'Dorei and beyond. You've defeated and you've
slain three members of the Conclave, allied with a

130
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:23,673
fourth, and you've made your way, along with an
army combined with the powers of Fort Daxio and

131
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:31,476
Syngorn, to the central city of Emon. Utilizing
aid from the Ashari people to cover the skies as

132
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:42,265
the armies began to assault the outer walls, you,
along with Zahra, Kashaw, Jarett, Gilmore, the

133
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,360
whole party, everyone's there, Kima--

134
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,814
TRAVIS: Britney Spears, NSYNC--

135
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,277
SAM: My other brother.

136
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:54,232
MATT: Drake's staying back with the army to help
them with the assault. You guys made your way

137
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:59,908
underneath through the sewer system, made a brief
alliance with some wayward Clasp who led you to

138
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:05,702
the center of town where the volcanic essence of
Thordak's mutated draconic form has been pulling

139
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:11,563
volcanic activity up beneath the city. You climbed
out on top and there, at the walled gates to the

140
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:16,392
central Cloudtop District, which Thordak now calls
his home and his lair, you saw two fire giants

141
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:23,716
guarding the entrance. Kashaw and Zahra, in a
heroic display, bound the giants to place and

142
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:28,548
decided to take care of them while you rushed into
the fray, bursting through the door due to the

143
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:38,588
strength of your Titanstone Gauntlets. You rushed
into the cloud, smoke, and ember-filled Cloudtop

144
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:46,672
District ruins, jumping from ruined building to
wreck of rubble and stone. The air itself is dense

145
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:52,276
and black with dark fume and it's hard to see
anything. You all carefully, gingerly, stealthily

146
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:58,569
made your way into the alcove of one ruined
building, where across the way, you see a giant

147
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:08,542
raised central cavern, a hole, a burrow, if you
will, that is close to 40 feet across. Apparently,

148
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:15,213
your approach was somewhat sensed by the red
dragon himself, as you watch Thordak emerge from

149
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:21,214
this burrow and climb out saying to itself, "It
appears we have visitors."

150
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,823
(sound of liquid pouring)

151
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:25,374
SAM: I'm really nervous.

152
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:30,008
(laughter)

153
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:36,707
MATT: So, as Ashley unfortunately can not be with
us, Pike's control and duty will be taken care of

154
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:40,739
by the twins for the evening. You guys will be
dual cleric-ing tonight.

155
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,060
LAURA: We're Jaegering.

156
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:50,351
MATT: Indeed. At this point in time, you guys are
all keeping as still and as quiet as you can while

157
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:58,815
figuring out your circumstances. You can hear the
low growling voice of Thordak as he begins to scan

158
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,959
the vicinity. (growling)

159
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,739
MARISHA: Potions! Potions!

160
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:05,360
SAM: Oh, good idea, good idea.

161
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,218
LAURA: I take fire resistance.

162
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,914
MATT: Fire resistance? Fire resistance, fire
resistance--

163
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:15,033
LIAM: Am I able to make a jello shot of
invulnerability and haste at the same time?

164
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:25,317
LAURA: But you know they only last for one minute
each. Just wait for like a second. Just wait. Fire

165
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:28,747
resistance lasts for a while, I passed them out,
so if you've got them, take them.

166
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:38,534
MATT: Okay, so we have Scanlan, Keyleth, Vex,
Grog, all with fire resistance? And Percy? All

167
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:42,876
right. That's pretty much everyone but you, I
believe, right?

168
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,364
LAURA: Oh, but he's got the armor--

169
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:50,464
MATT: So yeah, the entire party, thank god, is set
to resist fire. That may help your chances here.

170
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:55,856
As you all guys quietly begin to drink and figure
out your circumstances--

171
00:14:55,856 --> 00:15:00,976
TRAVIS: Why are you laughing? Why'd you laugh?

172
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:05,962
MATT: Because I was rolling Thordak's perception
check to see if he noticed any of your presences

173
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:08,566
as you were drinking the potions. I got a natural
one.

174
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:12,535
LAURA: Wow, just drinking a potion would make him
notice us?

175
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:15,042
LIAM: "I guess I'll go back to sleep now."

176
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:27,356
MATT: He's still scanning, and he's still like, "We
can sense you here. Where are you?" And you hear

177
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:30,449
(heavy footsteps).

178
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,268
SAM: Should I cause a distraction?

179
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,506
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

180
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:40,575
MATT: Okay. What are the components of that spell?
Let's take a look here.

181
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:49,761
LAURA: It can't be vocal because it's Pass Without
a Trace-- oh no, it's verbal.

182
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:50,876
MATT: Yep!

183
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:54,113
LAURA: No, I don't do that! I don't know what
those things mean!

184
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:57,019
TRAVIS: You better get your shit in gear.

185
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:02,760
LAURA: It's a whisper. Tell me it's a one! Tell me
it's a one!

186
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,366
MATT: That was not a one.

187
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:12,013
TRAVIS: I mean, let's be clear, what are we really
going to hide from? Look where his fucking head

188
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:17,999
is. He's like the sun. We ain't hiding from that
shit.

189
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:20,726
LAURA: He may have heard us, but now we've got
plus ten stealth.

190
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:32,501
MATT: So, as you guys are all quietly huddled over
in this broken space there, Vex'ahlia begins to do

191
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:37,811
her incantation beneath her breath and as you feel
the shadows cling to you, you hear in the

192
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:43,624
distance, "Ah. There you are."

193
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,772
TRAVIS: I just want to pee on myself and run.

194
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:53,567
MATT: He has currently moved out to this area, and
began to asses the scenery. I need all of you to

195
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,675
roll initiative.

196
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:58,489
(screaming)

197
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,250
LAURA: Already!? Take your potions!

198
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,826
LIAM: I can't, we're into initiative, right? It's
too late for potions.

199
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:10,502
MATT: You took your fire resistance potions.
That's all you had time to do.

200
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:12,172
MARISHA: That's not too bad, not too bad.

201
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:13,768
TALIESIN: That will do.

202
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:16,628
LAURA: Who's rolling for Pike?

203
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:21,109
LIAM: I'll do it. I got 11, plus what?

204
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,639
LAURA: I don't think she has anything, so--

205
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,913
MATT: Pike has no bonus.

206
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:29,575
TRAVIS: 14. Oh wait, you ask them, in order.

207
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:34,411
LAURA: I'm freaking out, shit, I'm sorry, I
thought I was helping.

208
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:38,419
MATT: Vex, what did you get?

209
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,537
LAURA: 13.

210
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,269
MATT: 13 for you? All right.

211
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,071
LIAM: 12, and Pike got 11.

212
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,582
TALIESIN: Pretty good for Pike.

213
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,881
LAURA and MARISHA: That is pretty good for Pike.

214
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:53,526
MATT: Keyleth?

215
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:54,711
MARISHA: 17.

216
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,222
LAURA: Good.

217
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,581
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty good for Keyleth. Oh
god.

218
00:17:58,581 --> 00:17:59,396
MATT: Percy?

219
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:03,670
TALIESIN: 25. Fast, fast.

220
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:12,308
SAM: Eight. I'll be bringing up the rear. That's
how I like it anyway.

221
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:17,632
LIAM: While we're cowering here, Pike says, "Guys,
I think I could really help you out if you wait a

222
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,400
"second. Okay?"

223
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,504
LAURA: Oh, Pike didn't even get a chance to--

224
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:29,192
TRAVIS: Were we supposed to have a Heroes' Feast?

225
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,572
LAURA: We did, we did have a Heroes' Feast.

226
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,640
TRAVIS: I'm so glad, I was totally here last
week.

227
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,126
LAURA: We're all immune to fear and poison still,
we all have advantage on wisdom.

228
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:39,288
MATT: You do indeed.

229
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:41,879
TALIESIN: And extra hit points.

230
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:51,958
MATT: All righty. So! With that, beginning of the
round, at the very top: Percival. You glance around the

231
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:57,378
corner and you see sifting through the large
columns of smoke that are billowing off each one

232
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:05,959
of these destroyed, burning buildings, you see the
gargantuan form of Thordak (heavy footsteps) and

233
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:09,684
looks right over. You see all of a sudden as his
eyes pass in your direction, almost like a cat

234
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:15,402
caught in a light beam, as his eyes flare up with
bright white light as it sees your presence.

235
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,667
TALIESIN: Okay.

236
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,327
TRAVIS: What do you see?

237
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:25,454
TALIESIN: It's coming. Is there room, can I get
even vaguely a shot in that room?

238
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:31,861
MATT: From here, at his size, you could get a shot
if you moved a little bit.

239
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,163
TALIESIN: I'll move a little bit.

240
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:35,631
MATT: Jump between these folks there.

241
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:39,772
TALIESIN: I have Spider Climb on right now, so
actually I'll climb up on the wall and then climb

242
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,351
back down when I'm done.

243
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,352
MATT: Okay.

244
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:52,018
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Ignore that, I've been
drinking. First of all, I'm going to cast Hex on

245
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,162
him. Because that's really going to make a
difference.

246
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,862
TRAVIS: No, it is! Stay positive!

247
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:01,623
TALIESIN: What kind of checks should I-- I'm going
to down him for--

248
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:04,462
MARISHA: I feel like he's real good at
everything.

249
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,366
LAURA: Like, wisdom, or something.

250
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:19,226
TALIESIN: I'm going to give him a disadvantage on
dexterity checks. Because fuck it. All right, I'm

251
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:24,028
going to take out Bad News, and I'm going to take
two shots, which is my way, with Hex and Bad News,

252
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:36,147
and hopefully everything's going to go just fine. I'm
going to use Sharpshooter, and I'm going to use

253
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:44,567
Deadeye on the first one. I'm going to drop a
point on Deadeye. So, Deadeye roll-- That should

254
00:20:44,567 --> 00:21:01,845
have counted, damn it, I shouldn't have picked it
up. Oh, thank god. That's-- sorry, I'm blanking.

255
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,154
26 to hit.

256
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:06,503
MATT: That hits.

257
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,051
TRAVIS: That's a good sign.

258
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:16,623
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's not start saying that now.
And that's-- wow, I'm nervous!

259
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:20,311
SAM: Wow!

260
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:35,148
TALIESIN: That's actually really good. First shot
is 21, 37 points of damage plus five points of

261
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:38,077
necrotic damage.

262
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,454
MATT: In addition to 37? That's nice.

263
00:21:40,454 --> 00:21:43,632
TALIESIN: That's really nice. I rolled really
high, and I have Sharpshooter running.

264
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:44,820
MATT: Good opening shot.

265
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:58,912
TALIESIN: Next one, I'm going to shoot
Sharpshooter, but no Deadshot. Is an 18 to hit?

266
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,674
MATT: Nope.

267
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:04,578
TALIESIN: Okay, second one misses. I'm going to
crawl back and hide again and get a little bit

268
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:08,057
of-- yeah, I got up on top, took two shots, and
crawled back down to hide.

269
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:12,809
MATT: All right, as you climb up to the top, you
slam Bad News over the top of the stonework, and

270
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,504
as soon as the barrel catches a little bit of the
light through the smoke, you watch as Thordak's

271
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:21,854
face whips over in your direction. (gunshot) The
first shot smashes across the crest on the front

272
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:27,905
of the dragon's face. You see sparks fly, and bits
of flame, red crystal get shattered in the

273
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:32,103
distance. The head spins back towards you, and
immediately you start shaking, and you fire the

274
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:38,208
second shot and it ricochets off of its angry,
thick hide. You immediately duck back behind the wall.

275
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:49,191
TALIESIN: I'm regretting so many things right now!
Not you! Oh god! I shouldn't avoid my family. It

276
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,665
leads to dragons.

277
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:56,252
MATT: In all of your focus, and all of your
attention into the arrival, and the crawl into

278
00:22:56,252 --> 00:23:00,752
this, and Thordak, none of you noticed that Larkin
is not with you.

279
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:03,032
LAURA: No surprise there.

280
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,255
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

281
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:05,356
LAURA: Piece of shit.

282
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:14,136
MARISHA: Piece of shit. Okay, I don't know what to
do here? What are we trying to do? Do we have a

283
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:17,243
plan? Should I try and burn a big spell?

284
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:23,142
SAM: Do whatever you do! We've been practicing for
this our whole lives.

285
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:32,738
MARISHA: Okay, before I do something crazy, based
off of Percy saying that, I turn to Vex and I go,

286
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:36,940
by the way, I've been meaning to ask you about
that, if he ever followed through, so stay alive,

287
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:44,947
we can talk later! Okay! And I pop over the corner
and I'm going to cast Tsunami?

288
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:47,656
SAM: I've never heard you say those words.

289
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,653
LIAM: No, it's not.

290
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:52,088
MATT: So you're casting Tsunami.

291
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,446
LIAM: She did this once and wrecked our enemies.

292
00:23:54,446 --> 00:24:00,775
MARISHA: That was Tidal Wave, this is like a big
daddy version of that.

293
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,319
LIAM: It's worse than that?

294
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:12,831
MARISHA: This is my 8th-level spell. So I create a
wall 300 feet high, 300 feet long, and 50 feet

295
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,478
thick of water.

296
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:23,008
MATT: You watch as the smoke is instantly replaced
with steam in the vicinity, completely filling the

297
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:29,223
area with fog, as this giant wall of water is
conjured out of the broken, cracked, dry earth and

298
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:40,212
begins curling over towards Thordak's front side.
All right, so, strength saving throw-- Wait, any

299
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,696
Huge or smaller creature.

300
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,994
LAURA: Is he bigger than Huge?

301
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:48,485
MATT: He is bigger than Huge.

302
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:53,536
LAURA: So it doesn't have any effect on him? Is he
bigger than 300 feet?

303
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,716
MARISHA: Yeah, he's not bigger than 300 feet, is
he?

304
00:24:55,716 --> 00:25:03,907
MATT: It's big, but the sheer mass size-- You
watch as the tidal wave smashes into Thordak and

305
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:07,654
splits and falls around him, no effect. His form
is too big--

306
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:08,861
MARISHA: None at all?

307
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:13,193
MATT: The water crashes against him, he's too big
for it to actually have an impact on him.

308
00:25:13,193 --> 00:25:16,013
LIAM: Are there any fires left burning in the
vicinity?

309
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:25,416
MATT: Actually, this fire is out now, this fire
goes out, and water spills down into the tunnel

310
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,676
and you watch a bunch of steam (whoosh) rise out
of it.

311
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:33,268
MARISHA: Well, it's also a six-round spell, and
he's supposed to get stuck in it. Nothing? No.

312
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:34,329
MATT: He's too big.

313
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:35,996
LAURA: He doesn't even get damaged at all,
though?

314
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:39,770
TRAVIS: Does he question his choices in life?

315
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,009
MARISHA: Because I'm questioning mine.

316
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,676
MATT: It says any Huge or smaller creature inside
the wall has to make a saving throw or take

317
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:53,205
damage, creature caught in the wall can move, but
yeah, it only seems to have an effect on--

318
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:57,036
SAM: Well, that was a valiant effort.

319
00:25:57,036 --> 00:26:00,605
MATT: I was with you. But, hey, 8th-level spell!

320
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,335
SAM: You got tons of 8th-level spells, you'll be
fine.

321
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:07,325
MARISHA: "But, hey, 8th-level spell?" Did you just
say that to me?

322
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:09,940
MATT: Sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

323
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,872
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

324
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,746
SAM: No problem.

325
00:26:16,746 --> 00:26:19,065
TALIESIN: I would get back behind the wall if I
were you.

326
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:22,664
MATT: So Keyleth, do you want to use the rest of
your movement?

327
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,199
SAM: Don't get back behind the fucking wall, don't
get back behind the wall, we're all bunched up. Go

328
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,487
somewhere else.

329
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:27,816
TRAVIS: Scatter.

330
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:31,707
LAURA: I know how painful this is right now,
Keyleth, but it looked really cool. Just run.

331
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:35,817
LIAM: Our pores are cleared-- the steam--

332
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:41,080
TALIESIN: The wall will at least take some damage
at this point, most things he's going to do are

333
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,086
going to be a giant area effect anyway that you're
not going to be able to outrun, you might as well

334
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,040
have cover--

335
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,312
MATT: Oh, wait, hold on--

336
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:48,890
SAM: Judges weighing in.

337
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,753
MATT: Sorry, I scrolled past that part there--
Each creature has to make a saving throw, so it

338
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:56,598
does affect him the first round. It does.

339
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:58,447
MARISHA: Just on the first round, though?

340
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,586
LAURA: Still, that's something!

341
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,903
MATT: Each turn after that-- so, yeah, basically
as it gets smaller it affects less and less

342
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:05,954
creatures. Sorry, I scrolled past that one.

343
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:08,964
MARISHA: So it just doesn't keep him restrained?

344
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:16,914
MATT: That is a 21.

345
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,979
SAM: What's your spell DC?

346
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:21,365
MARISHA: 20.

347
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:26,580
MATT: So it takes half-- so roll 6d10 and it takes
half damage.

348
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,848
SAM: Oh, that's something!

349
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:30,087
LAURA: That's better than zero!

350
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:36,685
MARISHA: It's better than-- yay, 8th-level spell,
to quote Matt Mercer.

351
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:42,491
TALIESIN: That will be our next t-shirt, "Yay,
8th-level spell."

352
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:50,348
MATT: It's fine. keep digging. This is my battle
against you guys.

353
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:51,770
MARISHA: I'm not digging!

354
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,181
LAURA: No, no, not at all! We're very happy with
that!

355
00:27:54,181 --> 00:28:02,506
MARISHA: 26, 35, halved.

356
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,950
MATT: Okay, half of the 35--

357
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,491
MARISHA: But it's not going to do anything to him
on subsequent rounds?

358
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:09,990
SAM: 17 points, that's something!

359
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,536
LAURA: Is there water all over the ground,
though?

360
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:15,059
MATT: It says here that at the start of each of
your turns after the wall appears, the wall along

361
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,616
with any creatures in it move 50 feet away from
you. So it will move him 50 feet back, unless he

362
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,952
gets out of it.

363
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:28,052
MARISHA: Yeah, it says any Huge or smaller
creatures must make a strength saving throw in

364
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,625
order to move.

365
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:33,210
MATT: Correct. He can move through it fine, he's
too big now, he doesn't take the additional damage

366
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,696
in following rounds.

367
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:39,153
MARISHA: So he gets to move out of it no problem?
Is that essentially the deal?

368
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:41,219
TALIESIN: But he is picked up for 50 feet, though.

369
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,082
MARISHA: Yeah, but is he moved back?

370
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:49,513
MATT: It still has to try and make an athletics
check against your spell DC to move at all, but it

371
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,504
doesn't take any additional damage.

372
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:53,106
MARISHA: All right, I'll take that.

373
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,156
MATT: It's her first time using this spell, guys,
so be patient, we're figuring this out as we go.

374
00:28:57,156 --> 00:29:05,545
TALIESIN: I would say also just because Pike was
going to do a thing, so come back for Pike's thing

375
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,007
that she was going to do.

376
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,580
MARISHA: Pike's going to do a thing?

377
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,037
LIAM: So is he.

378
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:14,156
LAURA: I feel like, run, Marisha, 'cause the thing that
Pike's going to do is--

379
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:17,197
MARISHA: Is that an AOE thing that she's going to
do?

380
00:29:17,197 --> 00:29:18,474
LAURA: Yeah, but just go.

381
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:24,817
MARISHA: All right, here's what I'm going to do,
I'm going to move in this area over here. Kind of

382
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:26,930
poke into this building?

383
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,748
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your full
movement.

384
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:37,057
MARISHA: No, no, I don't want to go that way, I
want to go behind-- sorry, this isn't very--

385
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:38,286
MATT: Over here?

386
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:44,598
MARISHA: Yes, that way. Thank you.

387
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:47,417
MATT: That right there is as far as you can get with your
full movement.

388
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,532
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

389
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:51,189
SAM: It's going to be great.

390
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,081
MARISHA: It's going to be so great, it's going to
be great.

391
00:29:54,081 --> 00:30:05,568
MATT: All right, that ends Keyleth's turn. Jarett
is going to go ahead and rush around here. Pulling

392
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:10,115
out his heavy crossbow, he's going to go ahead, as
he runs past, releasing a bolt towards Thordak--

393
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:18,567
two bolts, actually, that is a-- nope, that
misses. That also misses. Well, they both hit, but

394
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,366
they both splinter across his hide. All right,
Jarett's going to make the full move behind this

395
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:28,683
wall and begin loading another bolt. "It's all
right, we got this!"

396
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:30,890
SAM: He's dead.

397
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,676
MATT: It is now Gilmore's turn.

398
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:36,375
SAM: Shaun Gilmore!

399
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:45,125
LAURA: I'm sorry. I don't know how I just stole two
pencils.

400
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,436
LIAM: I do.

401
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:56,221
MATT: Gilmore is going to-- As he watches Jarett
rush off and Keyleth rush back around the wall,

402
00:30:56,221 --> 00:31:02,645
watching the wall of water crash past the dragon,
goes, "All right. It's been a while since I've had

403
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:09,427
"to do this." And he points his finger up towards
the dragon's head, and you watch as this green

404
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:16,311
spark shoots this single green beam in the
direction of the dragon's face.

405
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,580
TRAVIS: Please hit his face. Please hit his face.
Please hit his face.

406
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,223
LAURA: Hit him, Gilmore!

407
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:44,239
MATT: Let's see if it makes its dexterity saving
throw. That is-- yeah, he succeeds. Against the

408
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:58,292
spell DC, yeah, he succeeds with a 19. He goes and
fires and you watch as Thordak sees the beam

409
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:04,248
glimmer out of the fingers and he ducks down and
it fires past, dodging between the side of the

410
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:07,035
head and the beam goes casting out that way, no
effect.

411
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,453
TRAVIS: Shit hammer.

412
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:10,928
LAURA: What level spell was that, Gilmore?

413
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,699
MATT: "6th."

414
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:16,877
MARISHA: I look at him and I go, yeah, 8th, I feel
you, man.

415
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:20,224
MATT: "It's okay, we've got this."

416
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,429
MARISHA: Fucking sucks, bro, all right, let's do
this.

417
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:24,129
MATT: And he's going to go ahead and--

418
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,891
LIAM: I don't understand all this arcane
terminology.

419
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:34,203
MATT: "Scatter, right?" He pushes past and goes
running this way. All right, that's going to end

420
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,339
his turn. Grog!

421
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:41,882
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see Gilmore take off running, and
being there's a giant T-Rex on the map, I'm going

422
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:47,339
to go, "Must go faster, must go faster--" And I
would like to run as fast as balls this way

423
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,924
towards this cover as far as I can for 50 feet.

424
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:54,058
MATT: Okay. You get right about there, as Thordak
has the same initiative as you.

425
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:55,384
TRAVIS: Oh!

426
00:32:55,384 --> 00:33:01,433
MATT: Thordak, who has dodged the beam, and is
seeing the ants begin to scatter in front, goes,

427
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:04,616
"Moving targets--"

428
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,996
TRAVIS: Glad I joined Gilmore!

429
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:09,418
MATT: "We love moving targets." And he's going to
step forward--

430
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,732
LAURA: No! Don't move!

431
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:24,849
MATT: --and is going to rear back and (inhales)
(whoosh) and unleash Flame Breath.

432
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,517
SAM: Oh, Kiki, you're okay!

433
00:33:28,517 --> 00:33:30,425
LAURA: You made it!

434
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:41,515
MATT: I need Vex, Percy, Vax, Pike, Scanlan,
Trinket, Grog, and Gilmore to all make dexterity

435
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:44,612
saving throws. Hold on to that number.

436
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:47,025
TALIESIN: Does partial cover help at all?

437
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,898
MATT: No. The flame is like napalm.

438
00:33:49,898 --> 00:33:53,290
TALIESIN: I'm rerolling that.

439
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:58,594
MATT: Kima fails. Gilmore rolls a one! Are you
serious?

440
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,127
LAURA: Did you roll for Pike?

441
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:06,794
TALIESIN: That's a little better.

442
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,619
SAM: Can I Cutting Words to do anything?

443
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,337
TRAVIS: The Ancient Dragon?

444
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:14,643
MATT: Cutting Words actually can reduce the
damage.

445
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:17,576
SAM: Just the damage, not his attack?

446
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,975
TRAVIS: We'll take the damage reduction.

447
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,961
SAM: Will it reduce the damage for everybody?

448
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,053
MATT: I'm double-checking that. I'm pretty sure it
does.

449
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:27,019
SAM: If so, I will do that.

450
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:29,424
TALIESIN: I just had to use a Resolve.

451
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:32,359
LAURA: What did you roll?

452
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,479
TALIESIN: A one. So I had to burn a Resolve, which
I have done.

453
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:39,083
MATT: Yeah, so you can reduce the damage by a
certain amount for everybody.

454
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,696
SAM: It won't be much, but I'll do it.

455
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,182
TALIESIN: It'll help.

456
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:47,410
LAURA: And then he's got disadvantage on something
next, doesn't he? After you use Cutting Words?

457
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,969
MATT and SAM: Yes.

458
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,925
MATT: All right, so--

459
00:34:50,925 --> 00:35:00,835
SAM: So as he goes, I will yell at him, oi! What
sexual position makes the ugliest children? I

460
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,566
don't know, ask your mama!

461
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:07,384
(laughter)

462
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:14,127
MATT: Wow. That's a thing.

463
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:18,160
LIAM: I like to think of all of Vox Machina
nervously laughing.

464
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:30,438
MATT: She has advantage on her saving throw-- Kima
does make her saving throw! All right, so! Go

465
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:32,925
ahead and roll your d12 and it will reduce the
damage.

466
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,125
SAM: Guys, you can reduce that damage by five.

467
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,466
LAURA: Sweet.

468
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,582
SAM: So instead of 150, it's 145.

469
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:41,635
MATT: No, instead of 99 points of fire damage, it
is 94.

470
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:43,329
SAM: 94!

471
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:46,718
MATT: 94 points of fire damage.

472
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:49,725
LAURA: 9d4?

473
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:51,288
MATT: It was 99, now it's 94.

474
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:55,019
TALIESIN: Does the five get subtracted before we
halve it, or after?

475
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,874
MATT: It reduces the damage of the attack.

476
00:35:57,874 --> 00:36:02,356
LAURA: And then if we have fire resistance, then
it-- But what if we rolled 28, did we make our save?

477
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:04,665
MATT: Grog, what was your--?

478
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,897
TRAVIS: 17.

479
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,902
MATT: Nope.

480
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:07,713
LAURA: 28?

481
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:08,509
MATT: Yes.

482
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:09,308
LIAM: 24.

483
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:10,764
MATT: 24--

484
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:13,095
SAM: Oh shit. He has to look?

485
00:36:13,095 --> 00:36:14,336
MATT: You just make it.

486
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:17,351
TALIESIN: 24 is a "just made it?"

487
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,210
LIAM: So I take zero, because I'm using Evasion.

488
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,670
MATT: Yes you do.

489
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,714
MARISHA: I didn't have to roll.

490
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,198
TALIESIN: 18.

491
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:25,409
MATT: 18, nope.

492
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:26,361
SAM: 21.

493
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,417
MATT: 21, nope.

494
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,302
LAURA: And Trinket and Pike both fail as well.

495
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:37,363
MATT: Okay. Thankfully, that's half damage. So
that would be, at half of 94, 37-- I'm sorry, no,

496
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:48,337
47. 47 points of fire damage to Grog, to Percy, to
Scanlan--

497
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:50,107
LAURA: Pike and Trinket.

498
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,828
MATT: Well, Trinket does not take half.

499
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:54,907
SAM: Wait, I thought you said I didn't save.

500
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:59,075
LAURA: Takes the full 90-- Trinket is in my
necklace. Again, already.

501
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:01,513
MATT: Trinket goes right into your necklace.

502
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,960
SAM: Wait, wait, so I get 94 or 47?

503
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,043
MATT: You didn't succeed, so you would take 94,
but because you have fire resistance, you take 47.

504
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,189
SAM: Oh, okay! That's not bad!

505
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:18,911
MATT: You take half of 47, because you have fire
resistance and you made the save.

506
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:21,345
LAURA: So 23. 24.

507
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:25,043
TRAVIS: Tell me he has only one of those per day.

508
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,881
MATT: Nope, that regenerates.

509
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:28,091
LAURA: 23 or 24?

510
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:29,058
MATT: It would be 23.

511
00:37:29,058 --> 00:37:35,401
SAM: And Matthew DM, do our temporary hit points
go away first? Or last?

512
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:39,659
TALIESIN: They're technically not temporary, it's
actually your max increases, so they can come back.

513
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,302
MATT: Correct, they can come back, yeah.

514
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,893
TALIESIN: You can heal into them.

515
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,496
TRAVIS: Did somebody get temporary hit points?

516
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,863
SAM: We all did.

517
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,581
17, from our feast.

518
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:51,026
LAURA: Oh, that's right, Pike has-- I need to--

519
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:54,114
TALIESIN: You're 17 up. You can go 17 up even if
you lose them.

520
00:37:54,114 --> 00:37:57,064
TRAVIS: Right, well I'm going to add them now.

521
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:59,183
TALIESIN: Your max is now much higher.

522
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:03,972
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you, that's much better.

523
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:10,850
MATT: Okay. Kima's doing okay, but Gilmore is
looking rough. As the flames burn through, hyper

524
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:17,465
white, red, orange, blazing fire, you haven't felt
heat like this before. You instinctively close

525
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:21,835
your eyes, but it doesn't seem to help. As the
flames pass by you, Keyleth, you can even feel the

526
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:26,194
impact from here, singeing your eyebrows, and you
have to cover your face for fear of being

527
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:32,453
disfigured by the proximity. As the fire
eventually burns away, Gilmore is like stumbling

528
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:37,805
right now, burned all around. The rest of the
party is already smoking, bits of your outfits and

529
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:47,017
edges of clothing are now actually curling up and
burning. That was bad. So that ends Thordak's go. Grog?

530
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:52,714
TRAVIS: Well, being that my run was so rudely
interrupted by shit-chest over there, can I change

531
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:57,604
course seeing that he's going to barf fire at all
of us and run straight at him in a rage?

532
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,389
MATT: Yes, you may.

533
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:05,604
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we go ahead and see how we do
here, and I will go Reckless Attack, Great Weapon Master.

534
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,058
MATT: Sure.

535
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,024
LAURA: Doesn't that mean he gets advantage on his
attacks against you?

536
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:13,642
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, let's buy the ticket and
take the train, right? Who fucking knows. One!

537
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,213
Better. 19.

538
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:18,671
MATT: 19 misses.

539
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:22,555
TRAVIS: Shit. Roll better. That's better.

540
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:24,138
LAURA: He's so big, though!

541
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:25,691
MATT: But his armor is hard.

542
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:28,595
TRAVIS: That is a 25.

543
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:31,608
MATT: 25 hits. So the second attack hits. Are you
doing--?

544
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:33,556
TRAVIS: Reckless and Great Weapon.

545
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:38,103
MATT: Right, but I mean are you doing your frenzy
for the third attack? Or are you going regular?

546
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:40,212
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going frenzied!

547
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,721
MATT: All right.

548
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:46,794
TRAVIS: 21.

549
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:49,712
MATT: 21 misses. But you did get a hit in.

550
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:50,952
TRAVIS: I do.

551
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:54,097
LAURA: Oh my god. What was the second attack?

552
00:39:54,097 --> 00:40:11,842
TRAVIS: 25. So somewhere between 21 and 25. Which
one is the d12? This one. 11. Two points of

553
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,172
necrotic and 36 total.

554
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:24,016
MATT: 36, nice! As the flames subside from the
dragon breath, the flames part and you see,

555
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:30,810
rushing out, flames curling off the edges of the
fur, this angry raging goliath (yells) runs and

556
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:36,790
takes one swing. It skids across the scales of the
front of Thordak's chest, gleaning past the giant

557
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:45,752
scar in the center. No damage. Thordak (laughs).
You look up into the beaming star-like eyes and

558
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:53,769
angrily (yells). This time, the axe sinks in and
the laughter stops. You see the slight twinge of

559
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:59,417
pain in the right eye of the dragon as you pull
back for a third one, brings its claw up and

560
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:04,923
swings down to try and crush you. As you swing for
your attack, you instinctually realize it's

561
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:10,505
probably best to let this go and you duck out of
the way in time as the claw (slam) into the ground

562
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:11,946
in front of you.

563
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:21,219
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah! Fuck. That ends my turn.

564
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,479
MATT: Vex! Your turn!

565
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:29,360
LAURA: Cool! I click my Boots of Haste!

566
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:36,450
MATT: You feel, for the first time, the adrenaline
surge through you and you suddenly go, "My

567
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,338
"brother's been hoarding this this whole time?!"
Everything slows down around you ever so slightly,

568
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,142
and for a second, your mind's racing faster than
it normally does.

569
00:41:45,142 --> 00:41:50,559
LAURA: With my full movement, can I get behind the
wall up where Keyleth was headed?

570
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,352
MATT: You can move 60 feet.

571
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:57,607
LAURA: I want to stop in a place where I can
attack before I finish my move.

572
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:01,117
MATT: You'll go over there and as you're rushing
past, Keyleth--

573
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:05,559
LIAM: As she rushes past, she hears: (slowly)
Those are just a loaner!

574
00:42:05,675 --> 00:42:23,093
LAURA: (slowly) Go fuck yourself! Okay. All right.
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark. Then, for my

575
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:26,314
first attack, I'm going to try a Bramble Shot.

576
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:30,991
MATT: Percy, by the way, I need you to make a
concentration check. It's a constitution saving throw.

577
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:33,681
LAURA: Yes! 30 on the first.

578
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,156
MATT: That hits.

579
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,994
TALIESIN: Ten.

580
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,731
MATT: Your Hex fades.

581
00:42:38,731 --> 00:43:03,646
LAURA: I took the bracers off, right? Yes, I did.
Okay. 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak

582
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:14,783
attack and a Hunter's Mark. Ooh! 12 plus 4d8 for
the Bramble Shot.

583
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:19,746
MATT: Nice! So already at 29 damage plus--?

584
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:29,634
LAURA: 15. No. 13. 17.

585
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:41,337
MATT: Plus 17. All right! 46 points of damage on
the first strike! What's the DC on the strength

586
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:42,599
saving throw?

587
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,266
LAURA: Oh. 16.

588
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:46,249
MATT: Yeah. He makes it.

589
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,270
LAURA: That would have been amazing.

590
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:53,044
MATT: Ten plus 12. That would have been amazing.
As you run past and fire the first arrow, it sinks

591
00:43:53,044 --> 00:44:01,189
in and jams into the side of where the plates of
the chest armor meet the scar. As it hits, you

592
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:05,428
watch it cause a spurt of dragon blood, knowing
exactly where the weak points of the armor are,

593
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:07,201
being a person that studied dragons.

594
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:12,574
LAURA: Oh! That's right! And an additional d6
because he's a dragon, right? 2d6?

595
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:17,405
MATT: You should have the additional damage, I
think it was plus two damage against creatures

596
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,455
that are--

597
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,510
LAURA: Oh, just plus two.

598
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:24,370
TRAVIS: 2d20 of damage.

599
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,970
LAURA: I thought it was a d6. Sorry. You're right,
I think.

600
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,722
MATT: Do you want to go look it up?

601
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:35,683
LAURA: No, it's fine. I'll look it up between. My
next attack, I want to try one of my poisoned

602
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:36,729
arrows.

603
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:42,061
MATT: You see the brambles extend out from the arrow
and the dragon leans forward, already focused on

604
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:46,363
Grog as you're slamming him in the side. As his
body flexes, the brambles shatter.

605
00:44:46,363 --> 00:44:47,467
LAURA: 27!

606
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,759
MATT: 27 hits.

607
00:44:48,759 --> 00:45:09,068
LAURA: Okay! 14 plus four lightning damage. Plus
Hunter's Mark is another four. What is the poison?

608
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:10,913
Do I do anything for the poison?

609
00:45:10,913 --> 00:45:15,469
MATT I am going to go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw for him. Which succeeds.

610
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:21,522
So, yeah, he just resists the poison effects of
the arrows.

611
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:25,850
LAURA: Okay, and then I'm going to do a third
attack, right? Because I am hasted.

612
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,491
MATT: Yep.

613
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:31,822
LAURA: And that hits too! That's 31!

614
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:34,268
TRAVIS: Damn, girl.

615
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:45,258
LAURA: 16 plus another four lightning damage! Plus
Hunter's Mark, plus two plus two, because he is a

616
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:47,814
dragon. But I didn't do plus two on the second one
because I--

617
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:51,682
MATT: So 24 damage that final strike. Nice! You
did almost 100 points of damage in a single round.

618
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,847
(cheering)

619
00:45:54,847 --> 00:46:00,982
LAURA: And then I finish my round of movement and I
keep running behind the building. Yeah. Right

620
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:02,414
there. I know.

621
00:46:02,414 --> 00:46:08,941
MATT: As you rush past, looking up into the face
of the creature that you know for certain, seeing

622
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:12,820
it there, that this is the creature that brought
your mother to her end and half the city of

623
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,433
Byroden to the south. And as that anger swells
into you and mixes with the surge of adrenaline in

624
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:22,139
your body and you don't even feel the momentum,
your hands instinctively go through all training,

625
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,823
all the years that have gone by, as each arrow
gets loosed, there is just kind of this fuzz, this

626
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:33,591
kind of numbness, around as your hatred is focused
so clear on this dragon's head. And then the air

627
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:39,626
rushes back into your lungs and you slam your back
into the wall, preparing for your next round. All

628
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:43,626
right, that finishes Vex's go. Vax and Lady Kima
go at the same time. What do you want to do?

629
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:46,308
LIAM: I am going to down the potion of healing
with a bonus action.

630
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:47,903
MATT: Okay.

631
00:46:47,903 --> 00:46:50,467
LIAM: And then now I have two actions because of
the potion--

632
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:51,970
MATT: The potion of healing?

633
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:58,596
LIAM: No, no. Haste. So that's bonus action, now I
have two actions? Because of the potion.

634
00:46:58,596 --> 00:46:59,919
MATT: Correct.

635
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:02,432
LIAM: Second action's used to pump out the wings.

636
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:05,357
MATT: Okay. Wings are up.

637
00:47:05,357 --> 00:47:14,952
LIAM: Then I am going to fly directly towards
Thordak's face to-- you don't need that-- to ten

638
00:47:14,952 --> 00:47:20,459
feet away from him to his face. you can just hold
it for a second, and cast Vow of Enmity at him.

639
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:22,045
MATT: All righty.

640
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:28,681
LIAM: And then I am going to barrel roll back,
fly, and land hard right down next to my sister

641
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,109
where she's hiding.

642
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:34,354
MATT: Okay. At a non-hasted fly speed.

643
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,677
LIAM: 120, hasted.

644
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:40,705
MATT: Oh, because you are hasted with the potion.
So yeah, not a problem. Land right next to your

645
00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:42,033
sister.

646
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:46,720
SAM: So you prayed at him? Good job!

647
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,600
MATT: You swoop up, right in front, you cast the
Vow of Enmity.

648
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,696
LIAM: He could have taken a swipe at me. I'm just
glad he didn't.

649
00:47:55,696 --> 00:48:01,255
MATT: Oh, but we are going to get there. As you
swoop up within ten feet of his face and cast the

650
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:13,414
Vow, focusing on him, the dragon grins, and as you
pull out of his attack space, because he has a

651
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:19,231
reach of 15 feet with his bite, he is going to take
a bite attack at you. That is a 32 to hit.

652
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:21,283
LIAM: Can I Uncanny Dodge this?

653
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:22,427
MATT: You can.

654
00:48:22,427 --> 00:48:24,008
LIAM: Yeah. I have to.

655
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,261
TRAVIS: 32 to hit?

656
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,948
LAURA: We're fucked.

657
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:32,431
MATT: That's actually a bad roll. 17 points of
piercing damage plus--

658
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:38,974
LIAM: I knew it was going to happen.

659
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:43,346
MATT: Plus 16 points of fire damage reduced to
half.

660
00:48:43,346 --> 00:48:46,817
LIAM: No, 17 plus 16 total.

661
00:48:46,817 --> 00:48:49,311
MATT: Well, because you have fire resistance that
is reduced.

662
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:53,244
LIAM: Okay. So eight and 17. 25.

663
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,949
MATT: Yes, 25 points of damage to you.

664
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:56,782
LIAM: Gives me advantage on every attack.

665
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:58,230
LAURA: Oh, that's great.

666
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,348
LIAM: I will get sneak attack on every attack
whether there's someone next to him or not.

667
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:02,415
LAURA: That's good.

668
00:49:02,415 --> 00:49:04,334
TALIESIN: Good! That's really good.

669
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:13,679
MATT: Kima is going to--

670
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,063
SAM: Who that? Who that? Is that Kima?

671
00:49:19,063 --> 00:49:31,123
MATT: That's Kima. Kima can't do too much at this
distance, unfortunately. She is going to cast Aura

672
00:49:31,123 --> 00:49:33,115
of Vitality on herself.

673
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:36,121
SAM: On herself?

674
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:44,041
MATT: Correct. What that does is allows her to
heal people as a bonus action for as long as it

675
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:54,678
lasts. Which is pretty damn helpful, right now.
Let me pull it up real fast. Let's see, Aura of

676
00:49:54,678 --> 00:50:02,994
Vitality. She can use a bonus action to cause a
creature in the aura, including herself, to regain

677
00:50:02,994 --> 00:50:07,423
hit points. She's doing okay. She looks over at
Gilmore, who's hurt on the ground, staggering over

678
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:12,978
in flames. As she rushes up, casts the spell on
herself, holding her holy symbol of Bahamut to her

679
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:19,758
chest, she looks up at the dragon. "Remember me?"
Without even losing her vision, she puts her hand

680
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:24,432
out like this, and you watch as a beam of divine
energy streaks out, slams into Gilmore's side. He

681
00:50:24,432 --> 00:50:27,514
almost doubles over as it swirls around his body
and heals his wounds for 2d6.

682
00:50:27,514 --> 00:50:29,381
SAM: Okay.

683
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:30,794
MATT: So he heals four hit points.

684
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:35,668
SAM: He's looking better.

685
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:40,196
MATT: All right, that is going to end Kima's turn.
Pike's turn.

686
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:44,149
SAM: By committee.

687
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:50,631
LAURA: Okay, we're going to move to the corner of
the building that she's standing in.

688
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:55,722
LIAM: Inside. Squished into the corner.

689
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:59,791
MATT: Okay. Ten feet of movement to get there.

690
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:08,118
LAURA: Yes. She's going to, as a bonus action,
cast Spiritual Weapon. At fifth level.

691
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,943
LIAM: Okay. I'll mark that off.

692
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:11,359
TALIESIN: Go nuts with it, yeah.

693
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,658
MATT: What else is she doing this round?

694
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:15,945
LAURA: And then she's also going to cast Beacon of
Hope.

695
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:19,698
MATT: Beacon of Hope is a 3rd-level spell. If you
are casting a 3rd-level or higher spell as an

696
00:51:19,698 --> 00:51:23,782
action, you can only do a 2nd-level spell as a
bonus action. So you can either do Beacon of Hope

697
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:25,509
and then a 2nd-level Spiritual Weapon or--

698
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:30,629
LAURA: So we should do Beacon of Hope and not do
Spiritual Weapon because we want to do a higher

699
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,205
Spiritual Weapon later?

700
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:37,157
LIAM: So anyone within 30 feet of her is getting
some nice things.

701
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:41,870
LAURA: So anybody within 30 feet gets advantage on
wisdom, which you already have, but you get

702
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,824
advantage on death saving throws as well.

703
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:45,589
LIAM: And the best part--

704
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:50,029
LAURA: --is any time you're healed, you're
automatically healed to the max possible amount.

705
00:51:50,029 --> 00:51:51,684
SAM: What do you mean any time you're healed?

706
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:56,598
LIAM: When someone heals you, you don't roll. You
calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll.

707
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:58,068
LAURA: And that's what you're healed for.

708
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:01,945
TALIESIN: So, if it's 3d4, you just get 12. That's
amazing!

709
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:04,258
SAM: Do we get any healing from this as well?

710
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:09,296
LAURA: No, this is a prep spell. This is something
that probably we should have done before Thordak

711
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:10,635
started attacking us.

712
00:52:10,635 --> 00:52:12,391
SAM: Yeah, well, you're not Pike. You don't know.

713
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:16,237
LIAM: So, DM. Who all gets that? Looks like Grog
is just out of reach of it?

714
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:22,486
MATT: Within 30 feet of her? Grog is just out of
the radius. Gilmore, Kima.

715
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:26,334
LAURA: Should we have run around the corner? If we
had run around the corner, would Grog get?

716
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:34,434
MATT: If you run to there? Okay, yeah. That would
get Grog, Gilmore, Scanlan, Percy, Keyleth. It

717
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:36,041
does not get either of you.

718
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:39,562
LAURA: Well, that's fine.

719
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:42,744
MARISHA: This looks bad, but I feel okay about
this.

720
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,407
MATT: So that's your action?

721
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:47,316
LAURA: And that gets Pike in that as well.

722
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:49,213
SAM: You get a bonus action.

723
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:50,715
LAURA: Bonus action?

724
00:52:50,715 --> 00:52:53,531
SAM: You can do a Healing Word.

725
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:55,968
LAURA: Oh, that's right, Healing Word!

726
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,338
MATT: You can do up to a level two.

727
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:04,545
LAURA: Okay, so she should do a Healing Word. Is
Healing Word a level two?

728
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:06,941
TALIESIN: You can do it at any level you like.

729
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:10,212
LIAM: Percy needs it? Grog needs it?

730
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:11,858
LAURA: Grog needs it?

731
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:17,638
TRAVIS: Yeah. I took like 40 points of damage.

732
00:53:17,638 --> 00:53:21,876
LAURA: I feel like he's okay still, so Percy?

733
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:23,793
TALIESIN: One of the two of us, I would say.

734
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,151
MARISHA: I didn't get hit. I'm good.

735
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:27,713
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll take it. How much do I get
back?

736
00:53:27,713 --> 00:53:29,686
LAURA: At a level two, that's 2d4.

737
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,069
MATT: 2d4 plus five.

738
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:32,509
TALIESIN: 13.

739
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:38,917
MARISHA: Is that for everybody or just for her?

740
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:40,544
LAURA: Everybody.

741
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:46,126
MATT: Anyone who is affected by the spell, all
healing is maximum. For as long as it lasts, and

742
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:52,147
it's concentration. Okay, that ends Pike's turn.
Pike can technically move five more feet from

743
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:53,238
where she is.

744
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,727
LAURA: But she can't hide, though.

745
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:58,292
MATT: No. She's out in the open right now.
Scanlan, you're up.

746
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:07,072
SAM: I'll move ten feet towards that way, still
ducking behind that stone there. I will inspire

747
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:15,720
Percy. Wait, should I heal or inspire? I'll
inspire Percy. I'll sing him a lovely Christmas

748
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:26,164
song, (singing) You know Raishan and Vorugal, the
Frigid Doom, Brimscythe and Umbrasyl, we killed in

749
00:54:26,164 --> 00:54:36,220
his room. But do you recall the most fucked-up
dragon of all? Thordak the Cinder King had a

750
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:44,890
very shiny gem. And if you ever saw it, run the
fuck away from him.

751
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:50,051
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration die.

752
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:52,136
TALIESIN: All right. d12 is awesome.

753
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:54,228
MATT: Bards are great. All right, that's your
bonus action.

754
00:54:54,228 --> 00:55:02,456
SAM: And for the move, I guess I'll attack him? I
don't do that very well. I'll do Bigby's Hand.

755
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:05,881
(sings) Bigby's Hand! At level seven.

756
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:08,785
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

757
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:10,355
MATT: 7th-level Bigby's Hand!

758
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:17,321
TALIESIN: We're just going to spray-paint Matt's
hand purple and he's going to sit there, punch things.

759
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,362
LIAM: Check out the big hand on Scan.

760
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:25,706
MATT: Where do you want Bigby's Hand to appear?
Within 120 feet.

761
00:55:25,706 --> 00:55:34,365
SAM: I guess keep it low. Just go for the ball
shot, yeah.

762
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:37,062
MATT: All right, so what are you having the hand
do?

763
00:55:37,062 --> 00:55:40,419
SAM: Punch. Just punch.

764
00:55:40,419 --> 00:55:51,349
MATT: So Clenched Fist, and that is with plus 2d6
for each. Sorry, plus 2d8 for each slot above

765
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:55,746
fifth. That is an additional 4d8. That is 8d8. If
it hits. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.

766
00:55:55,746 --> 00:56:01,869
SAM: 18.

767
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:14,852
MATT: 18, no. The fist gleans off of Thordak's
chin. The dragon just kind of grins (growls). "Is

768
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:17,444
"this all you've got?"

769
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:21,406
SAM: Actually, yes. That is my biggest thing, so
yes.

770
00:56:21,406 --> 00:56:33,552
MATT: "Good." All right. That brings us back to
the top of the order. Now at the top of this

771
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:36,202
round, we're going to start doing lair actions.

772
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,940
LAURA: No!

773
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,958
TALIESIN: Lair actions are the worst.

774
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,347
MATT: It happens after Percy's turn, though.

775
00:56:42,347 --> 00:56:44,057
TALIESIN: Oh, good.

776
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:45,768
MATT: So, Percy, your go.

777
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:49,429
TALIESIN: Fine.

778
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:54,143
LAURA: Make sure he dies before he gets anything
else.

779
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:56,057
LIAM: Pull out your dragon gun.

780
00:56:56,057 --> 00:56:57,349
TALIESIN: My dragon gun?

781
00:56:57,349 --> 00:57:00,322
MARISHA: We're going to be real disappointed if
you can't take this all on your own.

782
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:05,807
SAM: Wait a second, Matt! Doesn't he get a disadvantage
on his save because of my Cutting Words?

783
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:07,704
MATT: That wasn't a save, that was your attack.

784
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:09,902
SAM: Yeah. That's what I meant.

785
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:12,139
MATT: On the next saving throw he has to make, he
has a disadvantage. Yes.

786
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:17,175
SAM: Making sure you guys know how spells work.

787
00:57:17,175 --> 00:57:19,273
TRAVIS: Yep, thank you. I was confused.

788
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:23,318
SAM: Jesus, Sam #3, why didn't you tell me that?!

789
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:26,860
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

790
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:36,526
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a deep breath and
shoot directly north, or I suppose to you it would

791
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:41,329
be south, down the map towards that building on
the far corner. I'm just going to run in that

792
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,867
direction.

793
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:46,486
MATT: As far as you can get with your full move?

794
00:57:46,486 --> 00:57:49,452
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get with my full
movement? And he has to recharge his fire probably

795
00:57:49,452 --> 00:57:50,820
before he can do that again?

796
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,165
MATT: Yeah, when it comes back to his turn I have
to roll to see if he gets it that round.

797
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:58,906
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. I'm going to take two
shots while I'm running. I'm going to, just

798
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:06,581
because I'm not feeling lucky right now, I'm going
to burn another Deadeye on my first run, so let's

799
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:07,696
do that.

800
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:08,995
MARISHA: Are you feeling lucky?

801
00:58:08,995 --> 00:58:15,536
TALIESIN: No, no, I am really not. So less so that
I'm not even going to do sharpshooter. That's

802
00:58:15,536 --> 00:58:17,381
awesome! I take that back.

803
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,178
MARISHA: Percy! You should have done it.

804
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:24,045
TALIESIN: It's okay. Actually, that doesn't affect
the crit at all. Sharpshooter isn't affected by a

805
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:29,802
crit. I critted, by the way. Sorry. That's nice.
So, hey! I get that Deadeye back. That's cool.

806
00:58:29,802 --> 00:58:32,987
TRAVIS: You should have said that first and we'd
all go, yay!

807
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:38,223
TALIESIN: This is like bad college theater. No one
knows when to applaud. Excellent. That's-- oh my

808
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:44,455
god, that's kind of nice. 1d12, 2d12, 3d12, 4d12.

809
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:49,261
LIAM: Nice. Actually not bad. Pretty good. This
makes me happy. This is going to be funny.

810
00:58:49,261 --> 00:59:06,530
TALIESIN: Pretty good. That's not great, but it'll
do. 24 points of damage. And I'm going to take

811
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:12,648
another shot. You know what? Screw it. Let's put a
sharpshooter on this. Actually, no. Never mind.

812
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:19,819
Yes! I'm going to put a sharpshooter on this. I am
so nervous. I'm putting a sharpshooter on it. Which

813
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,496
is good because I rolled--

814
00:59:22,496 --> 00:59:24,428
SAM: You have an inspiration.

815
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:27,753
TALIESIN: 17, 18, 19, 26.

816
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:28,887
MATT: 26 hits.

817
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:44,933
TALIESIN: Yay. And that's 2d12. Yay. Boo, but
that's okay. 30 points of damage.

818
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:51,675
MATT: Nice. So both shots as you are running
past, you watch as it slams into the sides,

819
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:57,122
causing a little (explosion) out of the side of
Thordak's armor, the scales slip for a second. The

820
00:59:57,122 --> 01:00:00,912
second shot smashes a small hole in one of the
wings, but you watch as the leather seems to be

821
01:00:00,912 --> 01:00:05,920
largely unaffected by the impact. It's already
tattered at the bottom anyway, but well done.

822
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,535
TALIESIN: (high-pitched noises) Okay.

823
01:00:07,535 --> 01:00:13,504
MATT: So, there you are. At the end of your turn,
Thordak's going to go ahead and use one of his

824
01:00:13,504 --> 01:00:23,765
legendary actions to do a tail attack against Grog
right now, because you're within range.

825
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:26,548
TRAVIS: Yeah, test your might. Oh no, please
don't! (sobs)

826
01:00:26,548 --> 01:00:29,569
MATT: That's going to be a 25 to hit.

827
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:31,033
TRAVIS: It hits.

828
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:37,651
MATT: Yep. You take 22 points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to half, so 11 points of

829
01:00:37,651 --> 01:00:39,386
bludgeoning damage to you, Grog.

830
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,695
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's good.

831
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:49,385
MATT: All right. That ends that. At this point
now, you watch as through the clouds this winged

832
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:57,359
figure comes and (crashing) lands on this distant
building, the flames flickering out.

833
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,193
LAURA: Moment of truth. Moment of truth.

834
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:10,293
MATT: As the impact happens, you watch as Thordak
turns and grins. "There you are. Oh, you're going

835
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:19,462
"to taste so good." Raishan grins from the side.
"Not to worry, my king."

836
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:22,432
SAM: Oh shit. That doesn't sound good.

837
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:24,864
LAURA: I can't tell what she's going to do.

838
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:27,504
SAM: Is she lying? She's a deceitful one.

839
01:01:27,504 --> 01:01:37,147
MATT: At this point, she will-- let me pull it up.
Oh there you go, there's the spell sheet. She's

840
01:01:37,147 --> 01:01:47,121
going to go ahead and move right there. Gets right
up onto the building that you guys are hiding

841
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,530
behind as you feel the rubble and rock tumble
around you, you look up and you can see the giant

842
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:59,284
green leathery wings unfurl. She inhales, her
chest expanding.

843
01:01:59,284 --> 01:02:01,619
(cheering)

844
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:10,066
MATT: Releasing a giant cloud of poisonous gas in
the direction of Thordak. Into his face. Suprise,

845
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,788
motherfucker!

846
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:19,293
SAM: We have the best friends.

847
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:29,887
MATT: Does not make his-- wait, this is a poison,
oh, it's constitution. He <i>does</i> make that. He

848
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,278
takes 38 points of poison.

849
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:35,947
TRAVIS: 38?

850
01:02:35,947 --> 01:02:49,880
MATT: 38 points of poison damage on that one. As
Thordak rears from the attack. "Oh, you'll die

851
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,586
"especially painfully."

852
01:02:52,586 --> 01:02:59,516
LIAM: Is Thordy La Forge poisoned there?

853
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:01,820
MATT: No, he just takes poison damage.

854
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,972
LIAM: No disadvantage. I really just wanted to say
Thordy La Forge.

855
01:03:04,972 --> 01:03:07,276
TALIESIN: Of course you did.

856
01:03:07,276 --> 01:03:16,485
MATT: All righty. So, that ends Raishan's turn.
Raishan's like, "Now, get in, circle and finish this!"

857
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:18,258
MARISHA: Wait, Raishan said that?

858
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:19,396
MATT: Yes.

859
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,472
TRAVIS: No, that was Lady Kima's voice.

860
01:03:21,472 --> 01:03:24,074
(laughter)

861
01:03:24,074 --> 01:03:27,466
LIAM: Clarota, is that you? On a flying steed.

862
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:31,371
MARISHA: I turn to Raishan and say, I don't take
orders from you, I'm only doing this because it's

863
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:40,712
a good plan. And then I run in. If I run my full
movement, can I get into touch range with him?

864
01:03:40,712 --> 01:03:44,275
MATT: You can, yes.

865
01:03:44,275 --> 01:03:50,522
MARISHA: Okay, angry at what happened before and
realizing that not a lot is probably going to work

866
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:59,979
unless I get ballsy, I run in guns blazing, and I
am going to do Contagion on him.

867
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:01,754
MATT: Okay.

868
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,520
MARISHA: I'm going to attempt Slimy Doom.

869
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,490
ALL: Ooh.

870
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:11,995
MARISHA: In honor of Zahra! And her teaching us
about hentai!

871
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:17,118
TRAVIS: Yup. I saw that hentai.

872
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:20,066
SAM: We hear Zahra in the distance, "I'm still
alive!"

873
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:27,962
MATT: Okay. So make a melee spell attack against
him. So roll a d20, add your spell attack bonus.

874
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:30,322
MARISHA: I know, I'm picking the right one.

875
01:04:30,322 --> 01:04:34,357
LAURA: It should probably be like a black or a
green or something that's like slimy.

876
01:04:34,357 --> 01:04:36,017
MARISHA: I'll do a green one. Green's good.

877
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:37,437
TRAVIS: Or just any dice.

878
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:42,800
MARISHA: Shut up, Travis. Ooh, that's not too bad.
That's not too bad, plus 12? So that's 28!

879
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,561
MATT: 28 hits.

880
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:47,911
MARISHA: (laughs) Redemption!

881
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:50,422
LIAM: Keyleth is on The Price is Right.

882
01:04:50,422 --> 01:04:55,790
MATT: Contagion, we'll put that blue there. So at
the end of each of the target's turns it has to

883
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:59,649
make a constitution saving throw. After failing
three, the disease takes effect.

884
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:02,524
SAM: After failing three?

885
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,761
MARISHA: He has to fail three.

886
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:10,096
MATT: So as you're rushing up, running past the
tumbling rocks and boulders of the barely standing

887
01:05:10,096 --> 01:05:14,718
ceiling that Raishan's stepping on, you rush
towards Thordak, and getting closer you see the

888
01:05:14,718 --> 01:05:19,512
immense size towering above you. And getting this
close, there is a heated presence around him, like

889
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:23,452
an aura of superheated air that burns you as you
get close enough to touch him. You reach out and

890
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:28,064
grab as you cast the spell under your breath. And
as you touch the edge of his scales, it's like

891
01:05:28,064 --> 01:05:33,065
touching a hot iron (sizzles). Your fingers singe
upon contact, but you feel the burst of druidic

892
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:40,766
energy pierce through the scales and you watch as a
little bit of black power seeps into the body and

893
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:42,954
curls in between the scales and has taken root.

894
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:44,764
TRAVIS: (whispered) Yes.

895
01:05:44,764 --> 01:05:53,288
MARISHA: That's all I got, right? I'm going to
turn. Grog, you're still down, right?

896
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:54,428
TRAVIS: (weakly) Yeah.

897
01:05:54,428 --> 01:06:00,923
MARISHA: I'm going to do a bonus Healing Word on
Grog. I'm going to go ahead and do it at third--

898
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,110
MATT: Can't do third level because you cast a
5th-level spell.

899
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:04,530
MARISHA: Second level.

900
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,296
MATT: All right. So 2d4 plus six.

901
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,595
MARISHA: But it's max. Eight plus six.

902
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:13,948
MATT: 14. You heal 14.

903
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:16,564
TRAVIS: Woohoo! 14 points. 194.

904
01:06:16,564 --> 01:06:22,090
MATT: All right. At the end of your turn,
Thordak's going to go ahead and use his next two

905
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:29,928
legendary actions to use his wing attack. Thordak,
now being surrounded by everything, goes (wing

906
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:35,559
flapping). He begins beating his wings. You watch
as the flames on the ground begin to curl up into

907
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,983
these small tornadoes in the presence from the
sheer vacuum of wind up under the wings. I need

908
01:06:40,983 --> 01:06:46,904
Grog and Keyleth and Raishan to make dexterity
saving throws.

909
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:51,653
TRAVIS: I think I have advantage on those,
(singing) because I got Danger Sense!

910
01:06:51,653 --> 01:06:56,815
MARISHA: 12.

911
01:06:56,815 --> 01:06:59,686
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

912
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,183
ALL: Ooh.

913
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:17,150
MATT: So you stay put, hunkering down for this.
Keyleth, you suffer 13 points of bludgeoning

914
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:21,592
damage. 13 points of bludgeoning damage and six
points of fire damage.

915
01:07:21,592 --> 01:07:24,526
MARISHA: To three, so 16 total.

916
01:07:24,526 --> 01:07:34,291
MATT: Yes, and you are knocked prone as the wind
blows you to the ground. And the dragon can move

917
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:43,613
up to half its movement speed. So it's going to
pull back to there.

918
01:07:43,613 --> 01:07:48,435
SAM: Do you get an attack, Grog?

919
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:52,257
MATT: You do. As you get hit by that, by the way,
you can do retaliation or you can do your attack

920
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:53,969
of opportunity, either works right now.

921
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:56,809
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Reckless and Great Weapon
Master.

922
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:01,610
MATT: Go for it.

923
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,804
TRAVIS: Eight and that's a natural 20.

924
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:08,058
MATT: Go ahead and roll your brutal damage there.

925
01:08:08,058 --> 01:08:11,650
SAM: Wow. That's a hit.

926
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:23,024
TRAVIS: 19, 20, plus ten is 30 points of damage,
including the one point of necrotic, and then I

927
01:08:23,024 --> 01:08:23,961
double that?

928
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:25,311
LIAM: Double all the dice.

929
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:27,308
TRAVIS: Double all the dice. Right so, 60.

930
01:08:27,308 --> 01:08:30,386
LAURA: No. Double the dice.

931
01:08:30,386 --> 01:08:40,096
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Okay. 12, so 25, 35, 37.

932
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:41,613
MATT: 37, nice.

933
01:08:41,613 --> 01:08:43,325
TRAVIS: Thanks. Two points necrotic.

934
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:46,898
MATT: Yes. Okay. So, as the wind beats up and the
dragon begins to back up--

935
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:49,244
LAURA: Did you add your plus ten, because it was
Reckless?

936
01:08:49,244 --> 01:08:50,556
TRAVIS: Yeah.

937
01:08:50,556 --> 01:08:53,867
MATT: --hovering off the ground, you strike out
with the-- technically, yeah, it was Reckless, you

938
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:58,392
cannot do Great Weapon Master on the-- well, I
guess you can on any attack you make. I'll double

939
01:08:58,392 --> 01:09:01,240
check on that real fast. So we'll say that's right
there.

940
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,315
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's a reaction I'm not quite
sure.

941
01:09:03,315 --> 01:09:05,368
MATT: I'm going to double check just to make
sure.

942
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:08,093
TRAVIS: That could have been better.

943
01:09:08,093 --> 01:09:10,115
LAURA: That's okay, that was a six.

944
01:09:10,115 --> 01:09:13,487
MATT: On your turn, so no, you cannot do that, so
26, yes.

945
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,458
SAM: That's great! That's extra! That's just
bonus.

946
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:24,460
MATT: You reach out with the axe amongst the heat
and the wind blowing in your face (wind blows) and

947
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,170
strike across the front of Thordak's chest as he
begins to swing back with his wings beating out.

948
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:33,904
All right, at the end of that turn, as Thordak
does that, at the end of that turn, Raishan's

949
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:37,463
going to use two legendary actions to cast Blight
on Thordak.

950
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:39,529
TRAVIS: There's some shit going down on this map.

951
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:46,008
LAURA: Oh my God, Matt. I'm impressed and
terrified of you for having to keep track of this.

952
01:09:46,008 --> 01:09:49,075
LIAM: They should really just do it already.

953
01:09:49,075 --> 01:09:52,673
LAURA: I honestly had no idea what my hands were
going to do.

954
01:09:52,673 --> 01:09:57,146
MATT: Constitution saving throw from Thordak.

955
01:09:57,146 --> 01:09:59,819
SAM: At disadvantage!

956
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:04,555
MATT: At disadvantage. That's a natural one. He is
going to use one of his legendary resistances.

957
01:10:04,555 --> 01:10:06,317
LAURA: Get rid of them.

958
01:10:06,317 --> 01:10:10,019
MARISHA: Burn it, burn it! Burn that shit.

959
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:13,081
SAM: He might have five of those.

960
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:14,487
TALIESIN: Yeah and now he's got four.

961
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:15,970
MARISHA: He has three, right?

962
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:18,103
LAURA: He's probably got more than three. He's
Thordak.

963
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:20,745
TALIESIN: Thordak, he's got like 12.

964
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:31,017
MATT: He takes 18 points of necrotic damage. All
right. And because I initially forgot it, lair

965
01:10:31,017 --> 01:10:32,247
action!

966
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:36,043
SAM: Oh shit. Lair action.

967
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:37,378
MATT: Lair action, indeed.

968
01:10:37,378 --> 01:10:41,707
LAURA: Isn't that like if you forget to move or
something, you don't get to do it later, if you

969
01:10:41,707 --> 01:10:43,500
forgot about it?

970
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,604
SAM: Everyone with knees dies.

971
01:10:45,604 --> 01:10:49,763
MATT: For that, we're going to choose--

972
01:10:49,763 --> 01:10:52,531
LAURA: No no no no, I was just joshing you!

973
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:57,126
TALIESIN: Don't make him look things up, it's
always going to be worse.

974
01:10:57,126 --> 01:11:08,335
MATT: The two twins that have currently ducked
around the way, you feel the ground nearby begin

975
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:14,042
to shake, and down below you the earth cracks open
and a giant column of magma (explosion) shoots out

976
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:15,380
and sprays in the vicinity.

977
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,531
LIAM: Evasion!

978
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:17,804
MATT: You've already used Evasion.

979
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:21,431
LIAM: On this round? It's once a round. This is a
whole new round.

980
01:11:21,431 --> 01:11:26,368
MATT: Actually, you're right, you're right. You
haven't gone since then. All right. Dexterity

981
01:11:26,368 --> 01:11:28,502
saving throw from both of you.

982
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:31,168
LIAM: Okay. At advantage, because of those boots,
man!

983
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:36,045
LAURA: That's good. (whispers) Okay, that's good,
that's good.

984
01:11:36,045 --> 01:11:37,601
LIAM: 23.

985
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:39,844
LAURA: 27.

986
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:43,325
MATT: Okay. You both take--

987
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:47,271
LIAM: Did we fail the save?

988
01:11:47,271 --> 01:11:49,405
MATT: You succeeded on the save.

989
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,838
LIAM: So I take zero.

990
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:57,468
MATT: So you take zero. You, however, take what
would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to half,

991
01:11:57,468 --> 01:11:58,747
so six.

992
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,839
SAM: (scoffs) You call this a lair?

993
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:10,789
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleth's go, it's now
Jarett. Jarett, who's loaded up his crossbow, is

994
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:19,730
going to go ahead and spin around, take two shots
at Thordak. That's a cocked die. That's good. 18

995
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:33,156
plus seven hits, and the second one just barely
hits, actually. There's two hits on him. Five

996
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:35,574
points. Two ones in a row for damage, are you
serious? Okay.

997
01:12:35,574 --> 01:12:37,132
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Jarett.

998
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:38,924
LAURA: It's okay, I'm happy that he's here.

999
01:12:38,924 --> 01:12:40,548
LIAM: Happens to everybody.

1000
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:46,578
MATT: And then he is going to try and move back
this way to keep everyone scattered and use the

1001
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:50,045
space to his advantage. That's going to end
Jarett's turn.

1002
01:12:50,045 --> 01:12:54,711
TALIESIN: Is there a little hole in the ground
where the magma came out or no?

1003
01:12:54,711 --> 01:13:03,473
MATT: No, it burst and then it cooled and covered
the space. All righty. That brings us to Gilmore's

1004
01:13:03,473 --> 01:13:07,966
turn. Gilmore, who's in a bad place, is going to
go ahead and take his superior healing potion.

1005
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:11,011
TALIESIN: Gets max healing, because he was in the
spell.

1006
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:20,448
MATT: That's true. Yeah, so he takes 16, 20, 24
plus eight is 32. Nice.

1007
01:13:20,448 --> 01:13:22,755
MARISHA: That's awesome! Good spell!

1008
01:13:22,755 --> 01:13:26,602
LIAM: Thanks Pike. We're so glad you're here.

1009
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:36,065
MATT: Gilmore, who currently drinks the potion.
"This is already not the best start to this, but

1010
01:13:36,065 --> 01:13:38,693
"let's see what else I can do here."

1011
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:49,054
LIAM: Come on, Shaun.

1012
01:13:49,054 --> 01:14:00,265
MATT: He's going to try a Hold Monster. From where
he is right there. That's a wisdom saving throw

1013
01:14:00,265 --> 01:14:10,937
for Thordak. Yeah, that succeeds. That's a nine
plus-- but he tried.

1014
01:14:10,937 --> 01:14:12,812
SAM: And looked good doing it.

1015
01:14:12,812 --> 01:14:15,536
LAURA: That's right. Those robes are fabulous,
Gilmore!

1016
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:30,082
MATT: "Thank you!" He goes darting behind the
other building off the opposite side. Yeah, that

1017
01:14:30,082 --> 01:14:33,988
actually doesn't help in this
circumstance. That ends his turn. Grog.

1018
01:14:33,988 --> 01:14:35,064
TRAVIS: Yes?

1019
01:14:35,064 --> 01:14:36,810
MATT: It's you and the dragon's go.

1020
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,070
TRAVIS: (giggles) Now, who's going first this
time?

1021
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,908
MATT: You both are going at the same time, so what
are you going to do?

1022
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:45,955
TRAVIS: Ah, you want to know what I'm going to do,
do you? Intimidated by my presence, eh? Whack the

1023
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:47,542
Titanstone Knuckles!

1024
01:14:47,542 --> 01:14:53,050
SAM: You're now 1/16 his size.

1025
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:57,768
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I now come up to his ankle
bone. Life is a thrill.

1026
01:14:57,768 --> 01:14:59,342
MATT: Basically.

1027
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:05,457
TRAVIS: Can I use my full-- oh, he's far away.
Shit.

1028
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:06,998
MATT: Yeah, he moved away from you.

1029
01:15:06,998 --> 01:15:15,396
TRAVIS: Balls and ass. I would like to run
straight forward and then veer off to this side,

1030
01:15:15,396 --> 01:15:17,623
I'm flanking him.

1031
01:15:17,623 --> 01:15:18,855
MATT: This side over here?

1032
01:15:18,855 --> 01:15:19,725
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1033
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,116
MATT: Yeah. You can get over to there.

1034
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,770
TRAVIS: Great. Am I now within striking range?

1035
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:23,921
MATT: You are.

1036
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:25,893
TRAVIS: I would like to make all three attack
Great Weapon Master, Reckless!

1037
01:15:25,893 --> 01:15:27,657
MATT: Go for it.

1038
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:38,728
TRAVIS: 12, oh, so close. Damn it, covering up the
wrong page. That's, damn it, 19.

1039
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:42,463
MATT: 19. The first strike, you slam the axe as
your form grows, rushing up next to the dragon,

1040
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:48,583
grinning, feeling the foam gathering at the corner
of your mouth. You swing with the axe and carves a

1041
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:51,083
small line, but doesn't actually penetrate the
armor of Thordak.

1042
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:56,654
TRAVIS: (Scottish accent) Great. That's better.
That is a 26.

1043
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,001
MATT: That hits.

1044
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,754
TRAVIS: Good.

1045
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:02,227
TALIESIN: You beat the Scottish into him.

1046
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:04,250
TRAVIS: 27 minus five is 22.

1047
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,244
MATT: 22 misses.

1048
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:09,199
TALIESIN: Good to know. We're learning. 22
misses.

1049
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,903
MATT: Roll damage on that strike.

1050
01:16:10,903 --> 01:16:13,096
TRAVIS: I got to get rid of that fucking Great
Weapon Master, that thing's killing me.

1051
01:16:13,096 --> 01:16:14,686
LAURA: Oh yeah.

1052
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:20,063
LIAM: His AC is high, so ditch the handicap.

1053
01:16:20,063 --> 01:16:24,944
TRAVIS: Hey, that's a six! Six points of necrotic
for a total of 36 points of damage.

1054
01:16:24,944 --> 01:16:30,678
MATT: 36 points of damage. Nice. So, as two blows
are deflected from the armor, one does sink in

1055
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:37,789
pretty hard, carving a piece of dragon flesh
that's dangling off now in the torso region.

1056
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:39,943
Thordak's like (snarls).

1057
01:16:39,943 --> 01:16:41,968
TRAVIS: 'Ello, poppet.

1058
01:16:41,968 --> 01:16:43,895
MATT: "Insect."

1059
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:45,765
TRAVIS: Sect?

1060
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:47,397
MATT: Is that your turn?

1061
01:16:47,397 --> 01:16:49,630
TRAVIS: Oh, insect. Yeah, that's my turn.

1062
01:16:49,630 --> 01:17:00,912
MATT: Yeah, okay. Thordak begins laughing, (deep
laugh).

1063
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:05,668
LAURA: Oh no, this is the laughter we heard about.
It drives you crazy. I cover my ears!

1064
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:08,799
MATT: The fire breath does not come back, it's a
two.

1065
01:17:08,799 --> 01:17:11,931
SAM: Oh, whew.

1066
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:13,469
TRAVIS: The fire breath does not recharge?

1067
01:17:13,469 --> 01:17:14,500
MATT: Nope.

1068
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,222
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

1069
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:21,575
MATT: However, he does make a full multiattack and
that's four attacks against you.

1070
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:27,160
TRAVIS: On me? I'm trying to keep him warm! Like,
I'm trying to give him a little touch, little

1071
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,002
feel, let him know that we love him.

1072
01:17:29,002 --> 01:17:33,687
MATT: And it's with advantage against you?

1073
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:35,212
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's right.

1074
01:17:35,212 --> 01:17:37,917
MATT: Okay, that's a 34.

1075
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,473
TRAVIS: I think that'll hit.

1076
01:17:39,473 --> 01:17:45,797
MATT: Natural one and a 15, that is a 32. Natural
20.

1077
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:48,447
SAM: On the last one, I'm going to Cutting Words.

1078
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,468
TRAVIS: There's three. There's one more.

1079
01:17:50,468 --> 01:17:52,381
SAM: Then on the last one.

1080
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:55,157
MATT: Okay. Natural 20! (laughs)

1081
01:17:55,157 --> 01:17:57,619
SAM: Well then, maybe that won't help.

1082
01:17:57,619 --> 01:18:00,610
TRAVIS: (singing) Happy trails to... shit.

1083
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:06,969
MATT: Okay, so a bite, two claw attacks, and a
tail attack against you, as its tail swings down

1084
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:19,708
and whips towards you. So, first, the bite attack.
You suffer 16 plus a 12. 28 points of piercing

1085
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,802
damage reduced to 14 as well as--

1086
01:18:22,802 --> 01:18:30,869
MARISHA: Come on, this is what you're built for.
This is why we trained you.

1087
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:35,414
MATT: 19 points of fire damage, reduced that to
nine.

1088
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:37,301
TRAVIS: Cool.

1089
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:44,987
MATT: So that's the first, that's the bite attack.
The two claw attacks against you. That is 18

1090
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:50,650
points of slashing damage reduced to nine. And
then the critical on the claw attack. That is--

1091
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,558
TRAVIS: Was there no fire damage on the second
one?

1092
01:18:52,558 --> 01:19:04,032
MATT: No, that's just the bite attack. That is 32
points of slashing damage, reduced to 16. And the

1093
01:19:04,032 --> 01:19:12,402
tail attack, that is also a crit. 24. 36 points of
bludgeoning damage.

1094
01:19:12,402 --> 01:19:14,418
SAM: Can I Cutting Words that?

1095
01:19:14,418 --> 01:19:15,993
MATT: You can, yes.

1096
01:19:15,993 --> 01:19:22,515
SAM: So I yell at him, "You're so ugly, you scared
the shit out of an outhouse!"

1097
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:29,783
MATT: Go ahead and roll your d12. 36.

1098
01:19:29,783 --> 01:19:32,105
SAM: Make that a 33.

1099
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:45,589
MATT: So 16 points of bludgeoning damage. And as
part of his multiattack, he also uses his

1100
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:54,090
Frightful Presence, so everyone, as you see it
clawing at Grog, it's like (roars), the tail whips

1101
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:58,231
down and slams the ground. The entire ground
quakes and you feel all the flames grow brighter

1102
01:19:58,231 --> 01:20:05,309
in the vicinity. While Thordak is large in this
moment, it's like staring at a fire god. I need

1103
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:06,575
everybody--

1104
01:20:06,575 --> 01:20:08,453
TALIESIN: Who is not immune to fear?

1105
01:20:08,453 --> 01:20:10,327
LAURA: We're all immune to fear.

1106
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,034
MATT: Everyone, yeah, all of you are immune to
fear.

1107
01:20:12,034 --> 01:20:14,315
LAURA: Yeah. Except for Jarett.

1108
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:21,579
MATT: Except for Jarett. Jarett does not succeed!
Jarett is pissing himself right now behind. He

1109
01:20:21,579 --> 01:20:24,831
almost ran into the wall and is like, "Oh, this is
not good!" (yells)

1110
01:20:24,831 --> 01:20:29,410
LIAM: Hey, Thordy, eat a dick.

1111
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:33,189
MATT: Raishan does make her save.

1112
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:34,397
SAM: Does not?

1113
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:35,312
MATT: Does.

1114
01:20:35,312 --> 01:20:36,727
LAURA: Oh, good.

1115
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:44,737
TRAVIS: Legendary? Did he do his legendary thingy?
Or he just made it?

1116
01:20:44,737 --> 01:20:48,736
MARISHA: Yeah, he also has to save against my
Contagion.

1117
01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:55,197
MATT: His turn's not done yet. Raishan uses her
legendary resistance to resist the-- Oh sorry, she

1118
01:20:55,197 --> 01:21:01,765
doesn't have to because she made it. From the
shaking and the quaking you watch as the flames

1119
01:21:01,765 --> 01:21:09,233
that brighten up leap out of the sides in the form
of two fire elementals.

1120
01:21:09,233 --> 01:21:10,601
LAURA: Damn it!

1121
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:13,091
MATT: That leap out of the sides of the cavern.

1122
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:14,583
LAURA: Can they fly?

1123
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,991
TRAVIS: Can we bring all the alcohol on set right
now?

1124
01:21:16,991 --> 01:21:22,434
TALIESIN: There's a lot of alcohol on the set
right now. A lot of it's hiding.

1125
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:24,249
LIAM: How about acknowledge it?

1126
01:21:24,249 --> 01:21:26,699
TALIESIN: There's a mini fridge built into
Trinket.

1127
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:32,722
LIAM: Ancient dragon wasn't enough, huh, Matt?

1128
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:37,637
MATT: Thordak is going to move around Grog to this
side.

1129
01:21:37,637 --> 01:21:42,511
TRAVIS: Yeah, move around me, bitch. I'm going to
get my insults in while I'm still breathing.

1130
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:45,224
MARISHA: He accidentally stepped on one of his
elemental friends.

1131
01:21:45,224 --> 01:21:51,180
MATT: He moved around it. It's fine. The
elementals are now going the same turn as Thordak.

1132
01:21:51,180 --> 01:22:15,980
50 feet. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. This
elemental. 35, 40, 45, 50. Right there. They're

1133
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,997
going to rush up and get into base to base with
you guys, and up to Keyleth, who's currently on

1134
01:22:20,997 --> 01:22:26,108
the ground prone as the elemental (roar) and comes
up against you. You hear the familiar sound of the

1135
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:29,095
flickering flame of its elemental form rush up
towards you.

1136
01:22:29,095 --> 01:22:33,485
MARISHA: I feel like I saw you, in like the fire
plane! 'Sup, man?

1137
01:22:33,485 --> 01:22:49,968
MATT: All righty. At this time, you also hear a
distant sound in the sky. A (sharp whooshes), but

1138
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:53,374
you make no visual. Everyone roll a perception
check.

1139
01:22:53,374 --> 01:22:57,602
SAM: 21.

1140
01:22:57,602 --> 01:22:59,168
MARISHA: 24.

1141
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:00,469
TALIESIN: 12.

1142
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:02,476
LAURA: Do I get advantage because it's
dragon-related?

1143
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:03,854
MATT: This is not dragon-related.

1144
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:04,968
LIAM: 25.

1145
01:23:04,968 --> 01:23:06,301
TRAVIS: Six.

1146
01:23:06,301 --> 01:23:07,791
LAURA: 16.

1147
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:11,196
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you rolled a 21, you
said?

1148
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,204
SAM: 21.

1149
01:23:12,204 --> 01:23:16,923
MATT: So, Scanlan, Keyleth, and Vax. You guys see
a shape in the darkness of clouds and the smoke

1150
01:23:16,923 --> 01:23:23,122
ahead. In between the sounds of thunder and
lightning in the distance, you see the bow of the

1151
01:23:23,122 --> 01:23:24,677
skyship Deera.

1152
01:23:24,677 --> 01:23:26,332
LAURA: Yes, the skyship!

1153
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:29,968
TALIESIN: Fucking Teddy Ruxpin.

1154
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:32,805
MATT: (laughs) Vex, it's your turn.

1155
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:38,975
LAURA: Me? Okay. Where can I go to where I can hit
him?

1156
01:23:38,975 --> 01:23:40,234
TRAVIS: Pretty much anywhere.

1157
01:23:40,234 --> 01:23:46,152
MATT: With your bow, you have quite a few options.
So you'd have to move around this way or this way.

1158
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:47,783
LAURA: Is the fire elemental right next to me?

1159
01:23:47,783 --> 01:23:50,026
MATT: It is. It'll get a swipe at you if you try
to move away from it.

1160
01:23:50,026 --> 01:23:56,158
LAURA: Asshole. If I'm a third level rogue, do I
get disengage?

1161
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:58,906
MATT: As a bonus action, yeah.

1162
01:23:58,906 --> 01:24:04,965
LAURA: Okay, so for my bonus action I'll
disengage. And then I'll move so I can hit

1163
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:12,591
Thordak. So can I move towards-- back towards the
very back building? Can I get all the way there?

1164
01:24:12,591 --> 01:24:14,640
MATT: With Haste, yes, you can.

1165
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:20,039
LAURA: Okay. So then I'm going to shoot him!
Before I duck in around a corner or whatever. And

1166
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:28,534
I want to-- oh, that's 18.

1167
01:24:28,534 --> 01:24:33,537
MATT: 18 does not hit. So you rush past,
disengaging. You hit up against the edge of the

1168
01:24:33,537 --> 01:24:36,652
wall with your arrow out (arrow whoosh). It arcs
past and misses.

1169
01:24:36,652 --> 01:24:45,151
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty far. Okay. This next one.
I'm going to use another poison arrow. Oh my

1170
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:47,809
God, I miss him again. Dice jail!

1171
01:24:47,809 --> 01:24:51,625
MATT: That one hits the hide but ricochets off.

1172
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:59,882
LAURA: Okay okay. Third attack. 25.

1173
01:24:59,882 --> 01:25:01,278
MATT: 25 hits.

1174
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:26,539
LAURA: Yay! One, that's one lightning, at 17 plus,
Grog is standing next to him? Yeah, it's good.

1175
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:29,397
That's nine, 13. Plus 13.

1176
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:31,442
SAM: Hey, that's many points.

1177
01:25:31,442 --> 01:25:33,385
MATT: So a total of--?

1178
01:25:33,385 --> 01:25:39,960
LAURA: 14, 15, 16, 17 plus 13.

1179
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:48,388
MATT: So 30. Nice. All righty. So the final arrow
releases and (whoosh) gets stuck up under one of

1180
01:25:48,388 --> 01:25:52,936
the scales on the side of where its shoulder and
body hits and the dragon, Thordak, turns and

1181
01:25:52,936 --> 01:25:56,494
(roars and laughs).

1182
01:25:56,494 --> 01:25:58,375
LAURA: Oh no, I hide behind that building.

1183
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:00,198
SAM: Oh, God. What was that?

1184
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:01,703
TRAVIS: Those faces are-- wow!

1185
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,515
TALIESIN: Yeah, way too many emotions happening
there.

1186
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:12,115
MATT: You hear the voice ring out, "Don't worry,
we'll take them down. All of them. Each and every one."

1187
01:26:12,115 --> 01:26:13,937
LAURA: He's crazy as fuck.

1188
01:26:13,937 --> 01:26:15,849
SAM: He's straight-up crazy.

1189
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:18,278
TALIESIN: No, he's not.

1190
01:26:18,278 --> 01:26:19,890
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex?

1191
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,577
LAURA: I guess so, I mean, I don't know what else
I can do.

1192
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,447
MATT: All right. Vax and Kima.

1193
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:26,622
SAM: When I was younger, I had an imaginary
friend, too.

1194
01:26:26,622 --> 01:26:28,305
LIAM: Should I go, or should Kima go?

1195
01:26:28,305 --> 01:26:34,662
MATT: (chuckles) Kima, frustratingly so, being a
short-ranged lady that she is, is first off going

1196
01:26:34,662 --> 01:26:38,894
to glance over and see Keyleth on the ground. How
are you doing, Keyleth?

1197
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:48,734
MARISHA: I'm okay. I'm on the ground, but I'm not
super low. I'm still full on hit points. Well.

1198
01:26:48,734 --> 01:26:52,001
MATT: Yeah, she's going to go full double move on
this one. She wants to get into the fray and is so

1199
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:57,819
frustrated that she's too far out of the way. Kima
is going to go ahead and rush out and do a 2d6

1200
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:01,515
heal to Gilmore again. So that's seven to
Gilmore.

1201
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:03,205
SAM: No, well he gets full healing.

1202
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:05,561
MATT: Oh that's right. 2d6, so it's a full 12.

1203
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:11,046
TALIESIN: That's so clutch. We should do that
every time from now on.

1204
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:24,467
MATT: Kima is now taking a full 50 foot move. 50.
Okay, she's charging in. "We've done this before

1205
01:27:24,467 --> 01:27:29,503
"and we can do it again!" as she has her Holy
Avenger arcing over her shoulder, running

1206
01:27:29,503 --> 01:27:34,727
screaming. (yells) Vax, what are you doing?

1207
01:27:34,727 --> 01:27:37,453
LIAM: Bonus action, I'm taking the potion of
invulnerability.

1208
01:27:37,453 --> 01:27:38,840
SAM: Oh, shit.

1209
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,044
TRAVIS: Time to get crunk.

1210
01:27:42,044 --> 01:27:44,805
LIAM: Next action, I cast Hunter's Mark on
Thordak.

1211
01:27:44,805 --> 01:27:46,057
LAURA: Yeah!

1212
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:47,487
MATT: Okay.

1213
01:27:47,487 --> 01:27:48,989
SAM: You can do that?

1214
01:27:48,989 --> 01:27:54,571
LIAM: Then I fly at Thordak's face and strike at
him with the dragon-slayer sword.

1215
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:56,600
(cheering)

1216
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,759
LIAM: Face. Face.

1217
01:27:57,759 --> 01:27:59,278
MATT: Right, so you're up in the air now.

1218
01:27:59,278 --> 01:28:07,489
LIAM: At advantage. Good. 26 hits.

1219
01:28:07,489 --> 01:28:09,216
MATT: Yes, it does.

1220
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:16,170
LIAM: So this is dragon-slayer sword plus Sneak
Attack, I'm going to Smite and Hunter's Mark.

1221
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:18,770
SAM: That's all the attacks.

1222
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:20,736
LIAM: Yes, all the attacks.

1223
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,356
TALIESIN: Every die.

1224
01:28:22,356 --> 01:28:47,639
LIAM: Okay, nine plus six is 17, plus-- 18, 19, 21,
balls. 21, okay plus the Sneak Attack. 27, 29, 33,

1225
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:58,226
39, 40, 42, 44, plus the Hunter's Mark, 45 total.

1226
01:28:58,226 --> 01:29:00,331
MATT: That includes the Smite damage as well?

1227
01:29:00,331 --> 01:29:02,106
LIAM: No, no.

1228
01:29:02,106 --> 01:29:04,974
MATT: It's 2d8.

1229
01:29:04,974 --> 01:29:07,347
LIAM: Now we're at 50.

1230
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:09,912
SAM: What about the dragon sword? Did you do
that?

1231
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:14,387
LIAM: That's done. So I don't know exactly how far
it was to his face and I know I'm all out of moves

1232
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:20,535
and I'm open to getting bitten again, but I want
to fly away from his face as far as I can and land

1233
01:29:20,535 --> 01:29:24,847
opposite everybody. Maybe near the lip. No, behind
the building behind him.

1234
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:29,535
MATT: I'm currently working out how much movement
you've done, because you're crazy.

1235
01:29:29,535 --> 01:29:38,719
LIAM: 120 feet of movement.

1236
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,863
MATT: It's about 65 to get up to his face.

1237
01:29:40,863 --> 01:29:42,443
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

1238
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,557
MATT: All right, and you're going to pull back
from him?

1239
01:29:44,557 --> 01:29:50,441
LIAM: Curve over his, oh, no-- sword's in his
head? My friends are going to fucking kill you

1240
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:54,271
today, you fuck! Arc over his head.

1241
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:58,561
MATT: The blade, which has jammed itself right in
the cheekbone under the eye of the dragon, as you

1242
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:08,306
draw it out, there's a streak of dragon blood
(roar, unhinged laughter). You arc over. As you

1243
01:30:08,306 --> 01:30:19,464
do, he reaches up with his face, his jaws (snarl)
reach out to try and bite you. That is a 21 to hit.

1244
01:30:19,464 --> 01:30:20,681
LIAM: No.

1245
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:25,812
MATT: The jaws snap in the air, just as you coast
through with your wings.

1246
01:30:25,812 --> 01:30:31,456
LIAM: I'll slam down, if I can, behind the
building behind his big fat ass.

1247
01:30:31,456 --> 01:30:32,943
MATT: Sure.

1248
01:30:32,943 --> 01:30:36,740
LAURA: I whisper on the earring, that was my
brother! That was my brother.

1249
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:42,226
MATT: You are going to have an attack of
opportunity from-- oh, no, you disengaged from the--

1250
01:30:42,226 --> 01:30:43,457
LIAM: I didn't disengage.

1251
01:30:43,457 --> 01:30:45,221
MATT: Oh, sorry, so the Fire Elemental actually
would have gotten an attack of opportunity on you

1252
01:30:45,221 --> 01:30:46,988
as you ran past.

1253
01:30:46,988 --> 01:30:50,690
LAURA: Before all that, he knocks you
unconscious.

1254
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:55,598
MATT: That's a 20-- yeah, misses.

1255
01:30:55,598 --> 01:31:02,172
TALIESIN: Vax, it might be worth taking a peek in
that crater when you get a second.

1256
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:04,248
LIAM: Working on it, working on it.

1257
01:31:04,248 --> 01:31:12,127
MATT: All righty, that ends your turn, Kima's
turn. Pike's up. However! At the end of Vax's

1258
01:31:12,127 --> 01:31:18,478
turn, Thordak is going to go ahead and use a tail
attack against Grog.

1259
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,726
MARISHA: Did he ever make that save, by the way?

1260
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:22,323
SAM: Not yet.

1261
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:31,995
MATT: Disadvantage, which is good because it was a
natural 20. And a six, plus 16, 22. Makes it.

1262
01:31:31,995 --> 01:31:38,463
LAURA: 22. He's got to roll under a four or lower
to get--

1263
01:31:38,463 --> 01:31:40,355
SAM: There's no way, it's not going to happen.

1264
01:31:40,355 --> 01:31:41,909
LAURA: It's possible! It's possible!

1265
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:43,379
MARISHA: It keeps going. It still goes.

1266
01:31:43,379 --> 01:31:45,538
MATT: It keeps going. It lasts for seven days.

1267
01:31:45,538 --> 01:31:47,719
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a seven-day thing.

1268
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:51,820
TRAVIS: After we're all dead, he'll get very sick.

1269
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:55,049
TALIESIN: If we die today, he's going to get the
flu later in his life.

1270
01:31:55,049 --> 01:31:59,326
TRAVIS: Let's reason with him! You can die now,
wait for later--

1271
01:31:59,326 --> 01:32:01,190
LIAM: "That doesn't look normal."

1272
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:05,188
TRAVIS: "Why does it burn when I pee?"

1273
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:13,554
MATT: However, it lasts for seven days, but
remember, that's if the spell succeeds. If he

1274
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,832
succeeds three saving throws, it goes away.

1275
01:32:15,832 --> 01:32:17,742
MARISHA: If he succeeds three?

1276
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:18,822
MATT: Yeah.

1277
01:32:18,822 --> 01:32:20,133
MARISHA: I thought he just had to fail.

1278
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,905
MATT: Fail three to take effect, succeed three to
just get rid of the disease.

1279
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:26,125
LIAM: Just dish out damage.

1280
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,068
LAURA: These damn spells.

1281
01:32:28,068 --> 01:32:29,774
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage.

1282
01:32:29,774 --> 01:32:36,713
MATT: So, anyway, that brings us to Pike. Oh, he
was doing the tail attack to you. So, using one of

1283
01:32:36,713 --> 01:32:39,474
the Legendary Actions to make a tail strike
against--

1284
01:32:39,474 --> 01:32:42,172
LIAM: So Legendaries can fall whenever they want?

1285
01:32:42,172 --> 01:32:44,217
MATT: At the end of someone else's turn.

1286
01:32:44,217 --> 01:32:45,687
TRAVIS: This is against me.

1287
01:32:45,687 --> 01:32:59,656
MATT: Yeah, because you're right there. With
advantage. That would be 31. So yeah, that hits you.

1288
01:32:59,656 --> 01:33:03,658
TALIESIN: I pray for a single-digit number.

1289
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,759
TRAVIS: Almost double my AC.

1290
01:33:05,759 --> 01:33:08,778
MATT: 20 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
ten.

1291
01:33:08,778 --> 01:33:11,407
TALIESIN: Man, you are a tank.

1292
01:33:11,407 --> 01:33:13,087
TRAVIS: Not much longer.

1293
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,613
TALIESIN: We're working on it.

1294
01:33:14,613 --> 01:33:16,941
MATT: All righty. So, Pike, what's Pike doing?

1295
01:33:16,941 --> 01:33:19,911
LAURA: Okay, Pike is going to run forward--

1296
01:33:19,911 --> 01:33:21,394
LIAM: "Oh, Grog!"

1297
01:33:21,394 --> 01:33:24,524
LAURA: "Oh, Grog!" And she runs as far forward as
she can.

1298
01:33:24,524 --> 01:33:26,656
MATT: That's as far as she can get.

1299
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:31,233
LAURA: We're trying to get a little diagonal, she
wants to be 60 feet away from him.

1300
01:33:31,233 --> 01:33:33,003
MATT: He's within 60 feet.

1301
01:33:33,003 --> 01:33:37,338
LAURA: Okay. Can she be at a diagonal so she's not
lined up with Keyleth and Bigby?

1302
01:33:37,338 --> 01:33:41,924
MATT: I mean, that's as far as she can get.

1303
01:33:41,924 --> 01:33:47,637
LAURA: Okay. Then she casts Heal on Grog, which
gives him 70 hit points, automatically healed.

1304
01:33:47,637 --> 01:33:49,335
TRAVIS: That's amazing!

1305
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:51,278
MATT: Yeah. So you're up 70 hit points, Grog.

1306
01:33:51,278 --> 01:33:55,040
LAURA: And that's a 6th-level spell, so she's
going to cast Spiritual Weapon as a 5th-level

1307
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,501
spell as her bonus action.

1308
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:58,885
MATT: She can't, because she already cast a
6th-level spell. If you do a spell that's higher

1309
01:33:58,885 --> 01:34:01,549
than 2nd-level, you can only do a 2nd-level spell
as your bonus action.

1310
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:05,188
LAURA: Oh, <i>that's</i> how it works. I thought it
just had to be lower than--

1311
01:34:05,188 --> 01:34:08,797
MATT: Technically, rules as written, you can't do
that, but as we've been playing, for the sake of

1312
01:34:08,797 --> 01:34:12,200
having so many players, I allow bonus action
spells as long as they're level two or lower.

1313
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:13,633
LAURA: Should we just do it?

1314
01:34:13,633 --> 01:34:14,674
TALIESIN: No, no.

1315
01:34:14,674 --> 01:34:16,798
LAURA: If she does it at a 2nd-level, then--

1316
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:18,370
LIAM: And it'll keep going.

1317
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:19,551
LAURA: Yeah.

1318
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:21,453
TALIESIN: But what happens if you do it at a
higher level?

1319
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:22,755
MARISHA: More damage.

1320
01:34:22,755 --> 01:34:25,933
LAURA: Well yeah, but she's always going to be at
a higher level than 2nd-level spells, so it

1321
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:27,072
doesn't matter.

1322
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,331
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, like, next round though,
if she does that at a 5th-level, just the damage

1323
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:33,392
it'll add will be more than double the damage
it'll do now.

1324
01:34:33,392 --> 01:34:36,476
LIAM: I say wait, because she's doing her job.
She's keeping Grog alive.

1325
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:39,660
MARISHA: So you might want to do that at a lower
spell level, and keep the higher levels for

1326
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:41,020
healing.

1327
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:51,668
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Wait-- okay, she can also
do Mass Healing Word as a bonus action at-- never

1328
01:34:51,668 --> 01:34:53,262
mind, that's a 3rd-level spell, so fuck it.

1329
01:34:53,262 --> 01:34:54,454
MATT: Yeah, sorry.

1330
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:57,287
LAURA: She can do Healing Word, though! At second
level.

1331
01:34:57,287 --> 01:34:58,601
MATT: She can.

1332
01:34:58,601 --> 01:35:01,398
LAURA: Should we do that? Who needs healing?

1333
01:35:01,398 --> 01:35:02,998
SAM: I mean, everybody.

1334
01:35:02,998 --> 01:35:05,108
LAURA: She's going to do Healing Word on Grog
again.

1335
01:35:05,108 --> 01:35:06,817
LIAM: At max.

1336
01:35:06,817 --> 01:35:12,913
MATT: Okay. So at second level, that means that's
2d4 plus five. So 13, you heal 13 hit points.

1337
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:14,091
TRAVIS: Nice!

1338
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:17,511
TALIESIN: Which is like another attack you absorb.
That's great. It's like one more attack to

1339
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:18,827
absorb.

1340
01:35:18,827 --> 01:35:22,935
MATT: All right, that ends Pike's turn, then.
Scanlan, you're up.

1341
01:35:22,935 --> 01:35:24,269
SAM: I'm up?

1342
01:35:24,269 --> 01:35:25,279
MATT: Yes.

1343
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:35,785
SAM: For my attack, I will punch the fire
elemental currently menacing Kiki with my fist of

1344
01:35:35,785 --> 01:35:37,062
fury.

1345
01:35:37,062 --> 01:35:39,316
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll a spell
attack.

1346
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,146
SAM: Okay, 24.

1347
01:35:41,146 --> 01:35:42,433
MATT: That hits.

1348
01:35:42,433 --> 01:35:43,736
LIAM: It would have hit the fucking dragon.

1349
01:35:43,736 --> 01:35:46,744
MATT: It would've. So 8d8 points of damage to the
fire elemental.

1350
01:35:46,744 --> 01:35:49,187
SAM: 8d8. I need all the d8s.

1351
01:35:49,187 --> 01:35:51,252
TRAVIS: All the d8s.

1352
01:35:51,252 --> 01:35:55,689
MARISHA: Here, I've got d8s, how many do you
need?

1353
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:58,888
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan. (mimes playing a flute)

1354
01:35:58,888 --> 01:36:00,670
TALIESIN: That's seven.

1355
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:11,255
SAM: Four... I need one more. That's a d12.
(laughs) Oh man, these are all good, though.

1356
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:12,835
TALIESIN: So you want one more, though.

1357
01:36:12,835 --> 01:36:21,734
SAM: I do. Oh my God! Okay. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
30, 41.

1358
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:27,850
MATT: 41 points of damage, nice! It slams into his
form and you watch as his body kind of tears open

1359
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:31,474
for a second, the flames dissipating and then form
back in, but they're starting to flicker.

1360
01:36:31,474 --> 01:36:32,921
SAM: He's not dead?

1361
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:33,888
MATT: No.

1362
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:35,888
SAM: As my bonus action, I'll punch him again.

1363
01:36:35,888 --> 01:36:37,090
MATT: No bonus.

1364
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:40,776
SAM: That was my action, as a bonus action, I can
do something else with Bigby, no?

1365
01:36:40,776 --> 01:36:42,935
MATT: Let me double check.

1366
01:36:42,935 --> 01:36:48,833
SAM: Every subsequent action I can do something as
a bonus action, does that also negate the action?

1367
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:53,798
MATT: When you cast a spell as a bonus action, it
says here you can move the hand and cause the

1368
01:36:53,798 --> 01:37:01,935
effects. It's your bonus action to move the spell.
So your action is there, I'll say-- it says

1369
01:37:01,935 --> 01:37:03,681
specifically bonus action.

1370
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:05,681
SAM: So I can't do it as my action?

1371
01:37:05,681 --> 01:37:07,537
LAURA: So you can do something else!

1372
01:37:07,537 --> 01:37:09,112
SAM: So that was my bonus action, then.

1373
01:37:09,112 --> 01:37:10,342
MATT: Correct, to do that is your bonus.

1374
01:37:10,342 --> 01:37:11,514
SAM: So I can do something else, then?

1375
01:37:11,514 --> 01:37:13,658
MATT: I'll let you do it again if you want to.

1376
01:37:13,658 --> 01:37:21,164
SAM: No, no, no, I'll do something else. Oh! By
the way, I can't use my movement to drink a

1377
01:37:21,164 --> 01:37:22,385
potion, right?

1378
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:23,280
MATT: No.

1379
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,480
SAM: Okay (laughs).

1380
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,085
TRAVIS: (laughing) I'd like to drink a potion.

1381
01:37:26,085 --> 01:37:31,043
SAM: Can I lean over the wall there? And I'll
Lightning Bolt the same guy.

1382
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:41,501
MATT: Okay. So it would be over the edge of that
wall there and (blasting noise). All right, go for

1383
01:37:41,501 --> 01:37:52,936
it. So that's a no. That is a 12 for its dexterity
saving throw, so it takes full damage.

1384
01:37:52,936 --> 01:37:55,386
SAM: All right, so.

1385
01:37:55,386 --> 01:37:58,255
TALIESIN and SAM: Oh!

1386
01:37:58,255 --> 01:38:01,548
SAM: Four ones in a row so far, so--

1387
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:04,105
(laughter)

1388
01:38:04,105 --> 01:38:12,328
SAM: So I made up for some of them. 15.

1389
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:19,051
MATT: 15 points of lightning damage against the
fire elemental. Okay, the bolt hits it and the

1390
01:38:19,051 --> 01:38:24,634
fire elemental goes (sizzling), not terribly
damaged by the impact.

1391
01:38:24,634 --> 01:38:26,719
TRAVIS: At least it didn't point and laugh at you.

1392
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,560
MATT: Okay, do you want to stay where you are?

1393
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,273
SAM: Yeah, absolutely.

1394
01:38:30,273 --> 01:38:34,465
MATT: Okay, that ends Scanlan's turn. Up to the
top: Percival.

1395
01:38:34,465 --> 01:38:37,861
TRAVIS: He used your full first name.

1396
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:39,903
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay, that's fine.

1397
01:38:39,903 --> 01:38:41,363
MARISHA: It's like when you're in trouble.

1398
01:38:41,363 --> 01:38:45,175
TALIESIN: I am in trouble. I have a whole bunch of
your d8s over here, by the way. Feel free to pull

1399
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:52,666
them out whenever you like. I'm going to try a
couple things. I'm going to do a piercing shot on

1400
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:59,074
the fire elemental, which I think I can do. I'm
going to start moving in a northerly direction, so

1401
01:38:59,074 --> 01:39:07,200
I guess I'll take like one or two steps southwest,
I suppose it would be to you. Yeah, there you go.

1402
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,452
MATT: There?

1403
01:39:08,452 --> 01:39:26,860
TALIESIN: Yeah, that'll do it. And I'm going to do
a piercing shot. That burns a grit, okay. That'll

1404
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:33,700
do! That's 25 to hit the elemental.

1405
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,623
MATT: 25 hits.

1406
01:39:35,623 --> 01:39:37,678
TALIESIN: And now I have to roll again for
Thordak?

1407
01:39:37,678 --> 01:39:43,154
MATT: Well, you have to decide whether your-- if
it's a piercing shot affecting also Kima or Grog.

1408
01:39:43,154 --> 01:39:46,599
Because it's a straight line, and it hits--
depending on how you angle it, you're either

1409
01:39:46,599 --> 01:39:48,252
hitting Kima or you're hitting Grog.

1410
01:39:48,252 --> 01:39:49,409
SAM: Oh shit.

1411
01:39:49,409 --> 01:39:50,435
TALIESIN: Really?

1412
01:39:50,435 --> 01:39:51,610
MATT: Yep.

1413
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:57,150
TRAVIS: I'm saying Kima's not actually attached to
a human being, just saying.

1414
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:59,283
TALIESIN: Kima's not short enough that it'll go
right over her head?

1415
01:39:59,283 --> 01:40:06,147
MATT: Nope. As per the rules as designed, no.

1416
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:09,977
TRAVIS: I totally love Kima, I got nothing against
her. Just looking out for myself right now.

1417
01:40:09,977 --> 01:40:15,208
MATT: She's parkouring off of the damaged wall,
trying to get into the fray with the dragon, and

1418
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:17,522
happens to catch where the bullet would be going.

1419
01:40:17,522 --> 01:40:19,753
TALIESIN: Okay, that's happening, apparently.

1420
01:40:19,753 --> 01:40:21,034
MARISHA: Are you shooting Kima?

1421
01:40:21,034 --> 01:40:23,689
TALIESIN: It's either Kima or Grog. Although Grog
takes half damage.

1422
01:40:23,689 --> 01:40:25,177
MATT: This is true.

1423
01:40:25,177 --> 01:40:27,003
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, come on.

1424
01:40:27,003 --> 01:40:28,250
TALIESIN: You take half damage.

1425
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:29,738
TRAVIS: All right. I'll remember this later.

1426
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:31,742
MATT: So Grog it is? Roll for attack against
Grog.

1427
01:40:31,742 --> 01:40:34,655
LAURA: I know, his head is so high. How are you
hitting Grog?

1428
01:40:34,655 --> 01:40:36,782
TRAVIS: It's in the rules.

1429
01:40:36,782 --> 01:40:37,951
TALIESIN: It's in the rules.

1430
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:43,641
MATT: In theory, from this angle, in to hit
the fire elemental and Thordak, he has to aim up.

1431
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:44,511
TALIESIN: 20.

1432
01:40:44,511 --> 01:40:46,857
MATT: 20? Against Grog hits?

1433
01:40:46,857 --> 01:40:48,011
TRAVIS: Yeah, it hits.

1434
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:49,606
MATT: And roll against Thordak.

1435
01:40:49,606 --> 01:40:57,109
TALIESIN: And, no. I can't have a misfire once
I've already hit the first?

1436
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:58,597
MATT: Correct, only the additional attack can
misfire.

1437
01:40:58,597 --> 01:41:00,124
TALIESIN: Okay. That's 15, that doesn't hit.

1438
01:41:00,124 --> 01:41:01,085
SAM: So you only hit Grog.

1439
01:41:01,085 --> 01:41:03,992
TALIESIN: I only hit Grog. No, I also hit the fire
elemental.

1440
01:41:03,992 --> 01:41:05,508
MATT: Roll damage once.

1441
01:41:05,508 --> 01:41:07,534
TALIESIN: Yeah, I hit the fire elemental, though.

1442
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:08,937
MARISHA: Maybe you'll kill it.

1443
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:13,284
TALIESIN: Maybe I will. Maybe it's Maybelline.
Where are my d12s, they seem to have all

1444
01:41:13,284 --> 01:41:14,689
vanished.

1445
01:41:14,689 --> 01:41:23,102
MARISHA: Kill it! Oh, jeez. Come on, man.

1446
01:41:23,102 --> 01:41:25,531
TALIESIN: That's awful. 13 points of damage.

1447
01:41:25,531 --> 01:41:33,082
MATT: Okay. Grog, you take 13 points of piercing
damage, halved to six. Round it down. Six.

1448
01:41:33,082 --> 01:41:35,472
TALIESIN: Sorry! And the bullet gets lodged in
you.

1449
01:41:35,472 --> 01:41:37,064
MATT: Yeah, basically.

1450
01:41:37,064 --> 01:41:38,923
LIAM: It's there for 50 years.

1451
01:41:38,923 --> 01:41:41,832
TALIESIN: Sorry! And then, is the fire elemental
still standing?

1452
01:41:41,832 --> 01:41:43,127
MATT: Yes, it is.

1453
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:48,086
TALIESIN: I'm irritated. I'm burning another grit,
and I'm going to do a pushback on the elemental.

1454
01:41:48,086 --> 01:42:00,814
That's actually no save, that's just a pushback. I
just have to hit. And that hits, I should have

1455
01:42:00,814 --> 01:42:04,692
done a-- that's a 29, 32 to hit.

1456
01:42:04,692 --> 01:42:09,415
MATT: 32 to hit. That'll hit, go ahead and roll
damage. And it just gets pushed back ten feet?

1457
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:11,144
TALIESIN: No, I'm saving you.

1458
01:42:11,144 --> 01:42:14,539
MARISHA: I mean, I could have handled it.

1459
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:19,639
TALIESIN: 14. I want you to be able to get up
without that thing on you. 20 points of damage.

1460
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:27,073
And it gets pushed back ten feet. Thank you.

1461
01:42:27,073 --> 01:42:31,141
MATT: Its form gets knocked back, coalesces again
as a flickering flame creature. It's looking hurt,

1462
01:42:31,141 --> 01:42:34,448
it's barely keeping its form together at this
point, it's still standing.

1463
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:46,998
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action for a
healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points.

1464
01:42:46,998 --> 01:42:52,680
Then I'm going to keep running, use spider to run
over that wall into that little house beneath the

1465
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,025
green dragon.

1466
01:42:54,025 --> 01:42:55,140
MATT: All right.

1467
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,886
LIAM: Spider-climb is cool.

1468
01:42:56,886 --> 01:42:59,868
SAM: Little house on the prairie, with the dragon
on it.

1469
01:42:59,868 --> 01:43:01,145
TALIESIN: There we go.

1470
01:43:01,145 --> 01:43:06,933
MATT: All right. That finishes your turn, Percy.
Now you watch as the skyship Deera pushes through

1471
01:43:06,933 --> 01:43:11,911
some of the clouds, and you can now see a series
of small shapes as it looks like a half-dozen

1472
01:43:11,911 --> 01:43:17,684
wyverns are currently harrying it from the sky,
attacking it. You can see some sort of combat

1473
01:43:17,684 --> 01:43:22,387
going on on the bow of the ship, but you also
watch as two of its arballists are set up, and

1474
01:43:22,387 --> 01:43:32,596
fire towards Thordak. That actually hits. That's
cocked. And, yeah. A 16 and a 15. With bonus, it

1475
01:43:32,596 --> 01:43:33,791
hits both.

1476
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,687
LAURA: That's Captain Damon, right? To the
rescue!

1477
01:43:35,687 --> 01:43:40,643
MATT: So, they're both super-heated, they are
flaming arballists, fire doesn't have an effect,

1478
01:43:40,643 --> 01:43:50,135
but they still do piercing damage, for a total of
22 points of piercing damage. You watch these two

1479
01:43:50,135 --> 01:43:57,730
large, thick heavy metallic piercing bolts come
arcing through, slamming into Thordak's hide. The

1480
01:43:57,730 --> 01:44:01,304
flames flicker on the edge where it impacted,
though it has little effect, and Thordak is

1481
01:44:01,304 --> 01:44:03,966
(insane growling).

1482
01:44:03,966 --> 01:44:05,240
TRAVIS: Crazy motherfucker.

1483
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,725
LAURA: He's so fucking crazy.

1484
01:44:06,725 --> 01:44:10,469
MATT: (insane growling) (maniacal laughter)

1485
01:44:10,469 --> 01:44:11,848
SAM: Oh, god.

1486
01:44:11,848 --> 01:44:16,142
MATT: Two of the wyverns apparently, noticing the
fray, and peel off, beginning to make their way

1487
01:44:16,142 --> 01:44:20,876
down to where this struggle is happening.

1488
01:44:20,876 --> 01:44:23,532
SAM: No problem. (whispered) Big problem!

1489
01:44:23,532 --> 01:44:26,006
LIAM: This is a busy battlefield.

1490
01:44:26,006 --> 01:44:29,311
MATT: At this point in time, I'm going to do--

1491
01:44:29,311 --> 01:44:32,226
TALIESIN: You're having way too much fun.

1492
01:44:32,226 --> 01:44:33,788
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

1493
01:44:33,788 --> 01:44:36,156
SAM: Matt has been waiting a year for this.

1494
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:38,407
LIAM: Don't worry, sir, we didn't see you playing
with your dolls.

1495
01:44:38,407 --> 01:44:49,430
MATT: (laughs) Grog and Kima. Suddenly the ground
quakes beneath you, and it splits open, and a very

1496
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:56,800
thick, yellowish-green sulfurous gas just spills
out in the vicinity, immediately filling your

1497
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,298
lungs and causing your chest to seize just from
breathing the air in. I need both you and her to

1498
01:45:01,298 --> 01:45:13,859
make a... The area is now heavily obscured, so now
there is a heavy smoke all in this area right now.

1499
01:45:13,859 --> 01:45:16,278
LAURA: Does his head peek up above that?

1500
01:45:16,278 --> 01:45:17,863
MATT: Yes, it does.

1501
01:45:17,863 --> 01:45:19,607
LAURA: He's so tall.

1502
01:45:19,607 --> 01:45:24,515
MATT: You don't do anything yet.

1503
01:45:24,515 --> 01:45:26,128
TRAVIS: Nothing yet?

1504
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:27,542
MATT: You don't do anything yet.

1505
01:45:27,542 --> 01:45:28,713
TRAVIS: On my turn.

1506
01:45:28,713 --> 01:45:29,792
MATT: On your turn, you'll do it.

1507
01:45:29,792 --> 01:45:31,642
SAM: Does that affect the fire elemental, too?

1508
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:32,821
MATT: It may.

1509
01:45:32,821 --> 01:45:34,775
LAURA: You don't know.

1510
01:45:34,775 --> 01:45:41,455
SAM: I don't. Sam Five has his theories, though.

1511
01:45:41,455 --> 01:45:49,834
MATT: For Raishan's turn, as smoke has filled the
area, (coughing) you're having a hard time--

1512
01:45:49,834 --> 01:45:55,743
Raishan sees this, picks up off the ground as the
wyvern begins to strike. First I'm going to see if

1513
01:45:55,743 --> 01:46:03,129
her breath comes back. It does not. Seeing the new
creatures in the fray, is going to rush up and

1514
01:46:03,129 --> 01:46:09,161
interfere with this one immediately, and just do a
full round of attacks against the wyvern.

1515
01:46:09,161 --> 01:46:13,245
TRAVIS: (singing) Eat the little pterodactyl.

1516
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:34,004
MATT: That'll hit. That'll hit. That'll hit. Bite
and two claws. Yep. That wyvern is looking really

1517
01:46:34,004 --> 01:46:38,000
hurt, as you watch as Raishan reaches up and just
tears into its side, and claws into its belly,

1518
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,732
they're both wrestling in the air, almost in a
momentary freefall, then catch themselves again.

1519
01:46:41,732 --> 01:46:45,782
Raishan just clings on. The wyvern is already in a
really, really bad place.

1520
01:46:45,782 --> 01:46:47,285
SAM: Oh, that's great.

1521
01:46:47,285 --> 01:46:58,639
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn. At the end of
Raishan's turn, Thordak is going to do another

1522
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,339
wing attack.

1523
01:47:00,339 --> 01:47:05,395
LIAM: Man, Groggy. 17 displacer beasts just
appear.

1524
01:47:05,395 --> 01:47:09,782
LAURA: Like, why would he add wyverns? For his own
sake!

1525
01:47:09,782 --> 01:47:17,105
MATT: He's going to do another wing attack, at the
cost of two of its actions. Picking up the wind

1526
01:47:17,105 --> 01:47:25,535
around it once more, I need Grog... Kima's just
out of the range, thankfully. Grog, I need you to

1527
01:47:25,535 --> 01:47:27,471
make a dexterity saving throw.

1528
01:47:27,471 --> 01:47:29,267
TRAVIS: I have advantage because of--

1529
01:47:29,267 --> 01:47:30,536
MATT: You do.

1530
01:47:30,536 --> 01:47:32,880
LAURA: Would the wings disperse the gas on the
ground?

1531
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,401
MATT: Nope! But it does push it.

1532
01:47:34,401 --> 01:47:36,042
LAURA: Damn it.

1533
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:37,326
MARISHA: Oh, boy.

1534
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:39,376
TRAVIS: 17.

1535
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:41,773
MATT: 17, nope. You take--

1536
01:47:41,773 --> 01:47:43,130
LAURA: Oh, no!

1537
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:46,801
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
eight.

1538
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:47,973
TRAVIS: Okay.

1539
01:47:47,973 --> 01:47:53,864
MATT: And you take eight points of fire damage,
reduced to four, from the impact, and you are

1540
01:47:53,864 --> 01:48:04,625
knocked prone. So you are now prone on the ground.
And this gets pushed ever-so-slightly this way.

1541
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,168
TRAVIS: Off of me?

1542
01:48:06,168 --> 01:48:14,971
MATT: Off of you, onto Keyleth, Pike, Kima,
currently. The dragon does shift.

1543
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:21,947
TALIESIN: Oh! No, Grog's down, so there's no
attack of opportunity.

1544
01:48:21,947 --> 01:48:31,707
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. Initially, I need you to
make a constitution saving throw.

1545
01:48:31,707 --> 01:48:39,446
MARISHA: Yeah, all right. Not that one, not that
one. Gil! Don't fuck me, Gil. All right, that's

1546
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:42,362
not too bad. 19.

1547
01:48:42,362 --> 01:48:46,968
MATT: 19, you succeed. You manage to just hold
your breath, and the poison doesn't makes its way

1548
01:48:46,968 --> 01:48:48,735
and fit into your lungs.

1549
01:48:48,735 --> 01:48:51,738
MARISHA: So, I still have this asshole in front of
me, right?

1550
01:48:51,738 --> 01:48:53,608
MATT: Yes, you do.

1551
01:48:53,608 --> 01:48:55,125
MARISHA: But he's been pushed back?

1552
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:57,371
MATT: It's pushed back, yeah, so it's not in
contact with you.

1553
01:48:57,371 --> 01:48:59,707
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got to see if you can get up
and walk away.

1554
01:48:59,707 --> 01:49:03,010
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool. I will stand up.

1555
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:04,499
MATT: Okay.

1556
01:49:04,499 --> 01:49:18,372
MARISHA: Rise up! This guy in front of me is
almost dead, right?

1557
01:49:18,372 --> 01:49:20,494
MATT: He's looking pretty rough, yeah.

1558
01:49:20,494 --> 01:49:23,402
SAM: Focus on the dragon.

1559
01:49:23,402 --> 01:49:25,986
TRAVIS: What was that?

1560
01:49:25,986 --> 01:49:27,392
SAM: "Focus on the dragon."

1561
01:49:27,392 --> 01:49:28,896
TRAVIS: "Focus on the dragon."

1562
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:32,898
MARISHA: How far away is Thordak from me?

1563
01:49:32,898 --> 01:49:38,965
MATT: Quite a ways away. I'd say close to 65, 70
feet from you.

1564
01:49:38,965 --> 01:49:56,687
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to-- Can I move up one
square closer to Thordak, but not get near the--

1565
01:49:56,687 --> 01:49:58,718
MATT: Yeah, right there, you can.

1566
01:49:58,718 --> 01:50:02,667
MARISHA: But I'm in this cloud, too! Shit.

1567
01:50:02,667 --> 01:50:05,007
SAM: You have resistance to poison clouds,
remember?

1568
01:50:05,007 --> 01:50:10,067
MARISHA: I don't, but that's nice. And now I'm
going to--

1569
01:50:10,067 --> 01:50:12,126
MATT: You are immune to poison, just so you're
aware.

1570
01:50:12,126 --> 01:50:13,192
MARISHA: Am I?

1571
01:50:13,192 --> 01:50:14,612
MATT: Because of the Heroes' Feast.

1572
01:50:14,612 --> 01:50:16,559
MARISHA: Oh, because of the Heroes' Feast! Oh,
that's right. Oh, well, fine.

1573
01:50:16,559 --> 01:50:17,767
MATT: Thordak doesn't know that.

1574
01:50:17,767 --> 01:50:22,688
MARISHA: Right. And then I'm going to cast Blight
on Thordak.

1575
01:50:22,688 --> 01:50:28,590
MATT: Okay. Thordak's going to make a saving
throw. This is constitution?

1576
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:31,077
MARISHA: I think so?

1577
01:50:31,077 --> 01:50:33,573
MATT: Success. So half damage.

1578
01:50:33,573 --> 01:50:37,140
SAM: Success. Half damage. Hey, you caused damage!
That's great!

1579
01:50:37,140 --> 01:51:01,843
MARISHA: I did! I did a thing! Not too bad. 11,
17, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35. 35, halved.

1580
01:51:01,843 --> 01:51:10,011
MATT: Half of 35, all right. As the Blight spell
takes hold, you watch as the tendrils of black

1581
01:51:10,011 --> 01:51:17,316
necrotic energy begin to carve between the scales
of Thordak's body. You watch as portions of the

1582
01:51:17,316 --> 01:51:23,566
scar in the chest split, almost like a fresh
wound. A little bit of pus begins to pour forth.

1583
01:51:23,566 --> 01:51:24,952
It's nasty.

1584
01:51:24,952 --> 01:51:29,901
MARISHA: I take a few steps back. Can I tuck into
that little broken building, a little bit? Just

1585
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:32,377
inside the doorway?

1586
01:51:32,377 --> 01:51:35,724
MATT: Sure. You are just inside the doorway right
now with Percy.

1587
01:51:35,724 --> 01:51:36,952
MARISHA: Perfect.

1588
01:51:36,952 --> 01:51:40,793
MATT: Actually, you can't quite get that far
because you were knocked prone, so you're just

1589
01:51:40,793 --> 01:51:46,989
barely... No, you can just get in there, so you're
good.

1590
01:51:46,989 --> 01:51:49,588
MARISHA: How are you doing?

1591
01:51:49,588 --> 01:51:53,289
TALIESIN: I am just-- I am regretting so many
things right now.

1592
01:51:53,289 --> 01:51:54,693
MARISHA: I don't know how we got here.

1593
01:51:54,693 --> 01:51:59,214
TALIESIN: Neither do I. I should have saved him--

1594
01:51:59,214 --> 01:52:01,956
MATT: Well, it is a 30-foot range.

1595
01:52:01,956 --> 01:52:03,331
MARISHA: What?

1596
01:52:03,331 --> 01:52:05,048
MATT: Blight has a 30-foot range.

1597
01:52:05,048 --> 01:52:07,224
MARISHA: Oh. Hm. Yeah.

1598
01:52:07,224 --> 01:52:11,014
MATT: So we're going to take that damage off.

1599
01:52:11,014 --> 01:52:12,634
MARISHA: Okay. Well...

1600
01:52:12,634 --> 01:52:14,973
SAM: Can we say that she walked 30 feet closer
to--

1601
01:52:14,973 --> 01:52:17,489
MATT: No, because she was prone at the start of
her round, she can only move 15 feet.

1602
01:52:17,489 --> 01:52:26,598
MARISHA: Okay. Well, then instead, (reverse
words), take me back. I can only do 15 feet. All

1603
01:52:26,598 --> 01:52:31,177
right. How many feet am I from the elemental?

1604
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:34,786
MATT: He is 15 feet from you. Ten feet.

1605
01:52:34,786 --> 01:52:36,645
SAM: You could have cast it on the--

1606
01:52:36,645 --> 01:52:40,833
MARISHA: No, I'm not going to blow a 4th-level
spell on his ass. I'm going to do a 1st-level

1607
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:42,897
spell, though, and do a Thunderwave.

1608
01:52:42,897 --> 01:52:48,960
MATT: Okay. So in that right there. What level,
you're going to do first level?

1609
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,354
MARISHA: Yeah.

1610
01:52:50,354 --> 01:52:54,778
MATT: Okay. That is a, what save? Constitution?

1611
01:52:54,778 --> 01:52:56,616
MARISHA: Yes.

1612
01:52:56,616 --> 01:53:03,166
MATT: That is a 17, so it does not succeed, I
don't think.

1613
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:08,587
MARISHA: It does not. It takes 2d8. Ooh, that's
good! Ten damage! Please kill it, please kill it!

1614
01:53:08,587 --> 01:53:11,597
SAM: Does my hand need to make a save, as well?

1615
01:53:11,597 --> 01:53:15,028
MATT: No, because she aimed the-- It's a cone,
right?

1616
01:53:15,028 --> 01:53:16,726
MARISHA: It's a radius.

1617
01:53:16,726 --> 01:53:18,635
MATT: Radius? So yeah, your hand would have to--

1618
01:53:18,635 --> 01:53:22,968
MARISHA: Oh, no, sorry. It's a cube. It's a cube,
15-foot cube.

1619
01:53:22,968 --> 01:53:30,496
MATT: Yeah, so you can just go right there. You're
fine. As you get up off the ground, the smoke, you

1620
01:53:30,496 --> 01:53:34,941
slam your staff into the ground. The smoke around
you dissipates momentarily as the shockwave hits

1621
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:39,713
the fire elemental. It just turns into ash, and
vanishes.

1622
01:53:39,713 --> 01:53:44,045
MARISHA: Got rid of that fucking asshole. All
right. And that's all I can do.

1623
01:53:44,045 --> 01:53:46,875
MATT: You have 15 feet you can move.

1624
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:50,098
MARISHA: Okay, now I'll tuck into there.

1625
01:53:50,098 --> 01:53:53,736
MATT: Now you can tuck in, yeah. Since you did
move that time. There you go.

1626
01:53:53,736 --> 01:53:56,232
TRAVIS, MARISHA: There you go!

1627
01:53:56,232 --> 01:54:08,170
MATT: At the end of Keyleth's turn, Raishan's
going to use a legendary action to make another

1628
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:15,834
attack against the wyvern. That will hit. And that
will do it. With that, the wyvern gets its head

1629
01:54:15,834 --> 01:54:20,753
ripped off by Raishan. The body plummets, the
lizardman that was riding it ends up falling off.

1630
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:26,354
Slams into the ground.

1631
01:54:26,354 --> 01:54:27,693
TRAVIS: Wilhelm scream!

1632
01:54:27,693 --> 01:54:29,789
MARISHA, TALIESIN: (half-hearted Wilhelm scream)

1633
01:54:29,789 --> 01:54:34,764
TALIESIN: I've got shit to do in the morning, I'm
not going to do it for real.

1634
01:54:34,764 --> 01:54:35,933
TRAVIS: All right, fair enough.

1635
01:54:35,933 --> 01:54:41,727
MATT: Nine points of bludgeoning damage, as it
hits the ground. It's still alive, but it's

1636
01:54:41,727 --> 01:54:49,615
looking up at this green dragon. That ends
Keyleth's turn. Jarett is currently afraid as shit.

1637
01:54:49,615 --> 01:54:54,161
TRAVIS: (laughs) Because he rolled not very good.

1638
01:54:54,161 --> 01:54:59,222
MATT: He's going to reload, and look over. He has
to roll with disadvantage against Thordak from

1639
01:54:59,222 --> 01:55:05,757
that distance, can't get closer. Even with
disadvantage, hits, on the first attack. With 16

1640
01:55:05,757 --> 01:55:08,007
and 18. Misses with the second one.

1641
01:55:08,007 --> 01:55:09,376
TRAVIS: Crossbow?

1642
01:55:09,376 --> 01:55:14,339
MATT: Yeah, with the crossbow. Still manages to do
13 points of piercing damage. To Thordak, which is

1643
01:55:14,339 --> 01:55:22,690
nice. Jarett is then going to finish moving out of
visual sight of this, like, "Nope, nope, nope!"

1644
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:29,077
Behind the wall, (panting) "This is, uh. This is a
terrible idea. They're not paying me enough for this."

1645
01:55:29,077 --> 01:55:33,619
TALIESIN: He's not going to take a shot at the
elemental while he's running away?

1646
01:55:33,619 --> 01:55:40,530
MATT: No, he was focused on Thordak. He was just
like, (yells). That ends Jarett's turn. Gilmore's

1647
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:48,904
turn. Gilmore is dodging out of the outside of the
cloud, and goes, "All right. Let's see if we can

1648
01:55:48,904 --> 01:55:52,747
"try this again." He's going to go ahead and move
up into the building just outside of the radius.

1649
01:55:52,747 --> 01:55:54,251
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

1650
01:55:54,251 --> 01:55:58,523
MATT: Looking behind where the window is busted
open, he's going to blow his one 7th-level spell

1651
01:55:58,523 --> 01:56:04,078
as a lower-level spell of Disintegrate once more
up towards the chest, where it's kind of cracked

1652
01:56:04,078 --> 01:56:15,314
open. That is a 24, 13 plus 11, that hits.

1653
01:56:15,314 --> 01:56:18,359
TRAVIS: Boom! Nobody else is excited about this?

1654
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:20,577
LAURA: I am. I am very excited.

1655
01:56:20,577 --> 01:56:24,793
TALIESIN: Once I hear a number, I'll be excited.
I'm not saying anything until I hear a number.

1656
01:56:24,793 --> 01:56:29,383
It's going to be, like, 11 points of
damage.

1657
01:56:29,383 --> 01:56:31,748
TRAVIS: 7th-level Disintegrate.

1658
01:56:31,748 --> 01:56:39,401
MATT: That's an additional 3d6 to that. That's
13d6

1659
01:56:39,401 --> 01:56:40,895
ALL: Oh!

1660
01:56:40,895 --> 01:56:43,217
MATT: Plus 40 points of force damage.

1661
01:56:43,217 --> 01:56:44,535
ALL: Whoa!

1662
01:56:44,535 --> 01:56:47,610
LAURA: 13d6.

1663
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:48,814
TRAVIS: Now y'all are excited!

1664
01:56:48,814 --> 01:56:50,566
TALIESIN: Now we're on board.

1665
01:56:50,566 --> 01:56:52,433
TRAVIS: I'm with you, Gilmore, I'm a true fan,
OG!

1666
01:56:52,433 --> 01:56:54,486
MATT: So it deals 88 points of damage to Thordak.

1667
01:56:54,486 --> 01:56:56,582
(cheering)

1668
01:56:56,582 --> 01:57:04,379
MATT: You watch as the beam slams right into the
side of Thordak's shoulder and torso area, the

1669
01:57:04,379 --> 01:57:12,593
beam firing out from behind the broken wall. The
wings extend as he's bearing down on Vax, and as

1670
01:57:12,593 --> 01:57:18,751
it hits, the flesh kind of peels away and turns to
dust in the vicinity. (pained roar) You can see

1671
01:57:18,751 --> 01:57:25,089
he's just reeling from the pain, the mouth opens
wide, the eyes go wide, as it begins to curl

1672
01:57:25,089 --> 01:57:30,048
across. As it does, you see it. There's a bit of
bone exposed there where the flesh once was. You

1673
01:57:30,048 --> 01:57:37,311
can see scar removed and pulled back. You can see
on the inside of the ribcage, just barely exposed,

1674
01:57:37,311 --> 01:57:41,641
the outside of a glistening red crystal that is
embedded in Thordak's chest.

1675
01:57:41,641 --> 01:57:43,112
SAM: He does have it.

1676
01:57:43,112 --> 01:57:44,505
LAURA: It was just covered.

1677
01:57:44,505 --> 01:57:45,956
TRAVIS: The skin's grown over it.

1678
01:57:45,956 --> 01:57:49,485
LAURA: And it's being absorbed, so I'm not going
to get it.

1679
01:57:49,485 --> 01:57:57,092
MATT: That is the end of Gilmore's turn. That
brings us to Grog and Thordak.

1680
01:57:57,092 --> 01:57:59,106
TRAVIS: Would you like to go first?

1681
01:57:59,106 --> 01:58:07,102
MATT: First let me see-- This roll is going to--
Yes. I would like to go first.

1682
01:58:07,102 --> 01:58:08,389
LAURA, SAM: Oh, no.

1683
01:58:08,389 --> 01:58:12,019
LAURA: He just got his fire breath back.

1684
01:58:12,019 --> 01:58:18,972
MATT: After getting disintegrated, Thordak, who
was focused on you, his attention keeps shifting

1685
01:58:18,972 --> 01:58:26,631
from place to place. He's not focused in his
current mental state. (enraged roar) And you watch

1686
01:58:26,631 --> 01:58:34,350
as he heaves, you see the flames flickering
brighter and brighter across him. (fwoosh)

1687
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:37,392
SAM: Oh, god. No.

1688
01:58:37,392 --> 01:58:38,863
MATT: Or actually, he'd be right there.

1689
01:58:38,863 --> 01:58:40,458
LAURA, SAM, TALIESIN: No!

1690
01:58:40,458 --> 01:58:43,886
MATT: You do get an attack of opportunity against
him.

1691
01:58:43,886 --> 01:58:45,390
LIAM: Yeah. Sneak attack, on top of that.

1692
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:47,555
MATT: Yeah, because you have advantage, if you
hit. So go ahead and roll twice.

1693
01:58:47,555 --> 01:58:54,067
LIAM: Got him, got him. That's 26 plus... is 27.

1694
01:58:54,067 --> 01:58:56,337
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
sneak attack.

1695
01:58:56,337 --> 01:58:57,770
TALIESIN: Are you using the sword?

1696
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:59,389
LIAM: Yep. Yes, I am using the sword.

1697
01:58:59,389 --> 01:59:00,986
TALIESIN: Yes, you are. Love it.

1698
01:59:00,986 --> 01:59:16,473
LIAM: Yes, where is my ten-sided die? Ten plus six
is 16. Plus all of this shit. 16, 17, 23, 29, 33,

1699
01:59:16,473 --> 01:59:26,706
34, 38, 42, plus Hunter's Mark. 43.

1700
01:59:26,706 --> 01:59:28,620
LAURA: Plus 3d6 for your dragon.

1701
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,798
LIAM: I already did that.

1702
01:59:29,798 --> 01:59:31,047
LAURA: No, you didn't.

1703
01:59:31,047 --> 01:59:38,533
LIAM: Correct. 43, thank you. 49. 50. 51.

1704
01:59:38,533 --> 01:59:46,368
MATT: 51 points of damage as Thordak rushes away
from you. (pained roar) As you cleave across his

1705
01:59:46,368 --> 01:59:53,020
underside, you watch as the blood just spills out.
(wings flapping, hard landing) Actually, no, he's

1706
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,757
not going to land, he's staying up in the air.

1707
01:59:54,757 --> 02:00:00,596
LAURA: There's no plastic big enough to support
him!

1708
02:00:00,596 --> 02:00:04,077
TRAVIS: Yeah, he ate too much, he can't get up in
the air!

1709
02:00:04,077 --> 02:00:05,506
LAURA: He's too fat to fly!

1710
02:00:05,506 --> 02:00:07,664
LIAM: Too many Krispy Kremes.

1711
02:00:07,664 --> 02:00:09,857
MATT: Thordak is currently up--

1712
02:00:09,857 --> 02:00:11,226
LAURA: Oh shit, he's high.

1713
02:00:11,226 --> 02:00:12,520
TRAVIS: You just hit Grog.

1714
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,059
MATT: I did, yeah. Hold on a sec.

1715
02:00:14,059 --> 02:00:17,195
TRAVIS: He does not appreciate that.

1716
02:00:17,195 --> 02:00:18,985
MATT: Grog will calm down.

1717
02:00:18,985 --> 02:00:23,029
LIAM: Here's Jenga, right here, that dragon's
coming down. Holy cow.

1718
02:00:23,029 --> 02:00:25,227
LAURA: Oh, my. There's rocks, it's on the rocks.

1719
02:00:25,227 --> 02:00:26,936
LIAM: It's like Mousetrap. Holy cow.

1720
02:00:26,936 --> 02:00:31,058
LAURA: Oh my god. Grog!

1721
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:32,867
LIAM: Oh my gosh!

1722
02:00:32,867 --> 02:00:34,831
LAURA: He's too big to fly, we told you!

1723
02:00:34,831 --> 02:00:36,925
LIAM: We'll use the theater of the mind, Matt!

1724
02:00:36,925 --> 02:00:44,451
TRAVIS: One little bump of that table, and it's
falling down.

1725
02:00:44,451 --> 02:00:51,348
LAURA: It's all coming down. It's like he's going
to knock over everything when comes down.

1726
02:00:51,348 --> 02:00:58,652
MATT: He's going to fire breath. That's going to
be Grog, Kima, Pike, and Gilmore.

1727
02:00:58,652 --> 02:01:01,468
SAM: And the hand.

1728
02:01:01,468 --> 02:01:03,304
MATT: And the hand.

1729
02:01:03,304 --> 02:01:06,460
TRAVIS: I really don't want that to fall. It's
going to break.

1730
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:12,793
MATT: So I need Grog and Pike to roll a dexterity
saving throw.

1731
02:01:12,793 --> 02:01:21,863
TRAVIS: All right. Come on, come on, Gil. Yes.
Even better! 21.

1732
02:01:21,863 --> 02:01:23,531
MATT: That's still not enough.

1733
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,075
LAURA: Pike rolled a ten.

1734
02:01:25,075 --> 02:01:26,861
TRAVIS: That was a 19.

1735
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:34,996
SAM: The hand rolled a nine.

1736
02:01:34,996 --> 02:01:41,615
LAURA: Oh, wait, does she get-- Wait. No.

1737
02:01:41,615 --> 02:01:52,175
MATT: That's 102 points of fire damage. Halved,
for both of you, so 51 points of fire damage. No,

1738
02:01:52,175 --> 02:01:58,169
no, to both of you! So 51 points of fire damage to
Grog, and Pike. Pike needs to make a constitution

1739
02:01:58,169 --> 02:02:01,909
saving throw to try and maintain concentration.

1740
02:02:01,909 --> 02:02:03,310
LIAM: 19.

1741
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,326
MATT: What's her constitution save?

1742
02:02:05,326 --> 02:02:08,577
LIAM: Her modifier, so, a total of 20.

1743
02:02:08,577 --> 02:02:16,014
MATT: Not enough. So-- It's half the damage you
take. She had to roll a natural 20. She probably

1744
02:02:16,014 --> 02:02:23,720
couldn't have made it, yeah. So Beacon of Hope is
gone. Beacon of Hope is gone. You took 51 points.

1745
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,436
TRAVIS: I took the 51.

1746
02:02:25,436 --> 02:02:28,119
LAURA: Right when she needs it the most! (shriek)

1747
02:02:28,119 --> 02:02:34,510
MATT: Kima rolls a natural 20 on her save, so she
takes half damage, at least, so Kima's still up!

1748
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:37,531
LAURA: If we hadn't had that Heroes' Feast, Pike
would be unconscious.

1749
02:02:37,531 --> 02:02:40,984
MATT: Kima does not maintain her spell,
unfortunately.

1750
02:02:40,984 --> 02:02:42,827
LAURA: Pike is way low.

1751
02:02:42,827 --> 02:02:44,793
LIAM: Pike is going to be looking out for Pike on
her next turn.

1752
02:02:44,793 --> 02:02:46,511
TALIESIN: That's cool.

1753
02:02:46,511 --> 02:02:49,853
LIAM: Got to have that ray of sunshine, man.

1754
02:02:49,853 --> 02:02:55,007
MATT: Gilmore rolls a natural 20 on his reflex
save.

1755
02:02:55,007 --> 02:02:56,374
EVERYONE: Yes!

1756
02:02:56,374 --> 02:03:07,858
MATT: That's awesome. And thank god, so he's still
unconscious. Gilmore is down and in flames right now.

1757
02:03:07,858 --> 02:03:09,433
SAM: Oh, god.

1758
02:03:09,433 --> 02:03:11,256
TRAVIS: Wait, Gilmore is down, and is
unconscious?

1759
02:03:11,256 --> 02:03:12,671
MATT: Unconscious.

1760
02:03:12,671 --> 02:03:14,736
SAM: Oh shit. I got him.

1761
02:03:14,736 --> 02:03:20,563
TRAVIS: How high is Thordak in the air?

1762
02:03:20,563 --> 02:03:24,490
MATT: Thordak is 50 feet up.

1763
02:03:24,490 --> 02:03:33,253
TRAVIS: Sam. What are you going to do?

1764
02:03:33,253 --> 02:03:37,601
SAM: I'm going to not let him die?

1765
02:03:37,601 --> 02:03:43,068
TRAVIS: Okay. Is somebody planning to go into the
fucking tunnel, on the earring?

1766
02:03:43,068 --> 02:03:45,670
LAURA: Wha-- why?

1767
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:47,832
TRAVIS: Because I can't hit him. He's too high.

1768
02:03:47,832 --> 02:03:50,433
LAURA: But he's-- There's crystals in his belly.

1769
02:03:50,433 --> 02:03:56,153
TRAVIS: But wasn't there a tunnel that we wanted?
I attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning

1770
02:03:56,153 --> 02:03:57,783
and I throw it at his feet.

1771
02:03:57,783 --> 02:04:00,726
MATT: Okay. So you stand up.

1772
02:04:00,726 --> 02:04:09,561
TRAVIS: Let me move 20 feet to his right rear,
over here. Just in case he decides to do the Cone

1773
02:04:09,561 --> 02:04:11,444
of Fuck Everything again.

1774
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:13,480
(laughter)

1775
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:15,292
TRAVIS: Then I'll throw the axe.

1776
02:04:15,292 --> 02:04:16,893
MATT: Okay.

1777
02:04:16,893 --> 02:04:24,985
TRAVIS: Reckless! 29.

1778
02:04:24,985 --> 02:04:26,802
MATT: 29 hits.

1779
02:04:26,802 --> 02:04:40,201
TRAVIS: Hey, that's a 12, that's great. Sorry, I'm
blanking out. 25, 27, plus the 1d4 because I'm

1780
02:04:40,201 --> 02:04:43,941
enlarged, which I didn't do last time. That's 30.

1781
02:04:43,941 --> 02:04:49,531
MATT: 30 points of damage. Good.

1782
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:58,933
TRAVIS: And I need to roll a DC of 14 to bring it
back in, but it's strength.

1783
02:04:58,933 --> 02:05:00,819
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

1784
02:05:00,819 --> 02:05:06,964
TRAVIS: That's too wild. That's off the wall.
That's a 12. That's off the wall. God, nipples on

1785
02:05:06,964 --> 02:05:09,592
a horse! Wait, do I have advantage?

1786
02:05:09,592 --> 02:05:14,420
MATT: While you're raging, you have advantage on
strength rolls. Was it athletics or strength?

1787
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:17,119
TRAVIS: Strength. Advantage on strength checks,
strength saves.

1788
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:18,625
MATT: So, roll again.

1789
02:05:18,625 --> 02:05:20,032
TRAVIS: 19.

1790
02:05:20,032 --> 02:05:26,314
MATT: You yank the axe back down, catch it in your
hands. You did the extra 1d4 damage from being

1791
02:05:26,314 --> 02:05:27,447
enlarged, right?

1792
02:05:27,447 --> 02:05:29,344
TRAVIS: I did. It's that little tiny one.

1793
02:05:29,344 --> 02:05:40,920
MATT: That is going to end Thordak's turn. Now it
is the elemental over here. It's going to

1794
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:43,999
(flame crackling) over next to Percy.

1795
02:05:43,999 --> 02:05:52,421
TRAVIS: Ooh! Is the Second Wind a bonus action?
Second Wind, the fighter thing?

1796
02:05:52,421 --> 02:05:54,592
MATT: That's a bonus action.

1797
02:05:54,592 --> 02:05:55,772
TRAVIS: Can I do that?

1798
02:05:55,772 --> 02:05:57,284
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

1799
02:05:57,284 --> 02:05:58,912
TRAVIS: 1d10 plus fighter level, which is one.

1800
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,577
MATT: 1d10 plus one.

1801
02:06:00,577 --> 02:06:03,905
TRAVIS: Nine. Ten! Ten hit points.

1802
02:06:03,905 --> 02:06:17,848
MATT: Ten hit points, all right. All righty. Let's
see. Vex, you're up.

1803
02:06:17,848 --> 02:06:33,114
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot him. I'm going to
reach back and I'm going to get a poison arrow.

1804
02:06:33,114 --> 02:06:35,840
MATT: It's your third and final poison arrow?

1805
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,041
LAURA: No, I've got six poison arrows. That one
missed.

1806
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:44,907
MATT: It just barely misses Raishan on the way.

1807
02:06:44,907 --> 02:06:53,920
LAURA: Sorry! Poison arrow. No, it's okay, it's
good. That is a 27.

1808
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,713
MATT: That hits.

1809
02:06:55,713 --> 02:07:16,025
LAURA: 15 plus four lightning. Does he have
anybody near him? Does he see me? Am I sneak

1810
02:07:16,025 --> 02:07:17,159
attacking?

1811
02:07:17,159 --> 02:07:19,140
TRAVIS: He's in the middle of the motherfucking
sky.

1812
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:21,324
MATT: You're not sneak attacking because nobody
nearby can hit him.

1813
02:07:21,324 --> 02:07:30,388
LAURA: Plus four because that's two for being a
dragon. Okay, so you know. And then the poison

1814
02:07:30,388 --> 02:07:31,682
arrow thing.

1815
02:07:31,682 --> 02:07:33,442
MATT: Right. He makes his save.

1816
02:07:33,442 --> 02:07:43,618
LAURA: My last attack. I'm going to try using my
last dragon-slaying arrow that I have.

1817
02:07:43,618 --> 02:07:51,798
MATT: Okay! This is the one you've had. This is
the one you've kept this whole time, right?

1818
02:07:51,798 --> 02:07:55,216
LAURA: It's got Thordak's name on it.

1819
02:07:55,216 --> 02:07:57,912
MATT: You reach back and you pull and there's
two.

1820
02:07:57,912 --> 02:07:59,454
LAURA: There's two?

1821
02:07:59,454 --> 02:08:01,077
MATT: There's two in there.

1822
02:08:01,077 --> 02:08:02,678
LIAM: Do it.

1823
02:08:02,678 --> 02:08:05,620
LAURA: Why do I have two?

1824
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:10,759
MATT: You pull one out, look, and there's a small
piece of paper attached to it.

1825
02:08:10,759 --> 02:08:25,142
LAURA: Ooh! I rip it off and tuck it in my shirt.
Pull. 21? No!

1826
02:08:25,142 --> 02:08:29,555
MATT: It arcs into the darkness, past the clouds
and out of the Cloudtop.

1827
02:08:29,555 --> 02:08:34,061
LAURA: Goddamn it.

1828
02:08:34,061 --> 02:08:37,153
TRAVIS: It's okay!

1829
02:08:37,153 --> 02:08:40,138
MATT: You still have movement if you want to do
something else.

1830
02:08:40,138 --> 02:08:42,660
LAURA: Is the building on fire?

1831
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:47,529
MATT: There's small flames here and there, but
there is a wyvern up above the wall now that seems

1832
02:08:47,529 --> 02:08:50,213
to have noticed you as you went around the corner
and fired a few arrows.

1833
02:08:50,213 --> 02:08:57,091
LAURA: Can I use my bonus to hide? From him?

1834
02:08:57,091 --> 02:09:02,634
MATT: You don't have anything to hide behind. It
notices you over the side. You can move, if you

1835
02:09:02,634 --> 02:09:04,424
want to, and try to do that.

1836
02:09:04,424 --> 02:09:09,259
LAURA: The building is on fire? Can I move and try
to duck into the building? I see a hole that's not

1837
02:09:09,259 --> 02:09:10,363
on fire.

1838
02:09:10,363 --> 02:09:12,950
MATT: You could move around here and duck inside
there.

1839
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:17,660
LAURA: Yeah. I'll try to hide in the building
because wyverns, he's so dumb.

1840
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:21,626
MATT: Go ahead and roll stealth.

1841
02:09:21,626 --> 02:09:25,529
LAURA: How about that? That is a 14.

1842
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:32,950
MATT: That's a 14? All righty. I forgot to do the
fire elemental attacks against you, Percival,

1843
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,185
from earlier.

1844
02:09:34,185 --> 02:09:35,919
TALIESIN: I had an environmental attack?

1845
02:09:35,919 --> 02:09:39,527
MATT: Fire elemental attack that came over there
and attacked you. It was during Thordak's turn; I

1846
02:09:39,527 --> 02:09:45,168
forgot to do that. It gets two touch attacks
against you. That is 13.

1847
02:09:45,168 --> 02:09:46,929
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

1848
02:09:46,929 --> 02:09:49,605
MATT: That's cocked. Natural 20.

1849
02:09:49,605 --> 02:09:51,122
TALIESIN: That hits.

1850
02:09:51,122 --> 02:09:53,917
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh. Not your natural 20.

1851
02:09:53,917 --> 02:09:57,694
TALIESIN: Yeah, not mine.

1852
02:09:57,694 --> 02:10:04,062
MATT: 17 points of fire damage, halved to eight,
and you are on fire.

1853
02:10:04,062 --> 02:10:06,890
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh.

1854
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:09,167
TRAVIS: And you are on fire.

1855
02:10:09,167 --> 02:10:10,939
TALIESIN: Does stop, drop and roll work in--

1856
02:10:10,939 --> 02:10:16,603
MATT: You have to use an action to get rid of it.
So yes. And every turn, you'll take 1d10 fire

1857
02:10:16,603 --> 02:10:24,512
damage until you get rid of it. All right, so,
finishing Vex's turn, it is now Vax and Kima's.

1858
02:10:24,512 --> 02:10:29,538
Kima's going to make a constitution saving throw.
Kima makes it and is unaffected. Well, she's

1859
02:10:29,538 --> 02:10:31,666
unaffected by the poison anyway because she was
part of the Heroes' Feast.

1860
02:10:31,666 --> 02:10:35,383
LAURA: Oh, right, that's poison. So she's immune.

1861
02:10:35,383 --> 02:10:42,571
MATT: Yeah, Kima is angrily going to rush over to
Gilmore.

1862
02:10:42,571 --> 02:10:44,351
SAM: (pouring drink)

1863
02:10:44,351 --> 02:10:46,455
MARISHA: It's never not weird.

1864
02:10:46,455 --> 02:10:48,532
SAM: (contented sigh)

1865
02:10:48,532 --> 02:10:53,294
LIAM: It's really on Matt for there being no pee
break.

1866
02:10:53,294 --> 02:11:00,957
MATT: It's true. It's true. Kima is going to go ahead
and Lay Hands on Gilmore.

1867
02:11:00,957 --> 02:11:02,838
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Kima.

1868
02:11:02,838 --> 02:11:16,975
MATT: She's going to heal him for 35. All righty,
so as Kima rushes over, still staring at Thordak

1869
02:11:16,975 --> 02:11:24,118
up in the air, (wing flapping) she hand vaults
over the destroyed wall, runs over to Gilmore's

1870
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:29,391
unconscious burning form and, moving her hand out
of the way to put the flames out, pats him down

1871
02:11:29,391 --> 02:11:34,040
and as her hand glows and she slams onto his chest
and you watch (gasping) the breath come to him.

1872
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:39,634
As his eyes flicker open, she goes, "It's not your
time yet, buddy." Picks up her sword and angrily

1873
02:11:39,634 --> 02:11:45,125
looks over towards Thordak again. She can move
five more feet that way, that's as much as she can

1874
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:50,773
get this turn. But that's her action. Pike's
turn.

1875
02:11:50,773 --> 02:11:52,204
LIAM: Vax's turn.

1876
02:11:52,204 --> 02:11:53,665
MATT: Sorry, Vax's turn.

1877
02:11:53,665 --> 02:12:02,311
LIAM: I'm going to fly straight at Thordak's
flank. You can put me, well, don't actually put me

1878
02:12:02,311 --> 02:12:03,699
there, because he'll topple.

1879
02:12:03,699 --> 02:12:05,172
MATT: Yeah, but you're up there.

1880
02:12:05,172 --> 02:12:08,368
LIAM: But I'm going to attack twice, once with the
dragonslayer sword, once with Whisper, so here's

1881
02:12:08,368 --> 02:12:10,360
the dragonslayer sword. Natural 20!

1882
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:12,395
(cheering)

1883
02:12:12,395 --> 02:12:13,902
LIAM: Sneak attack damage!

1884
02:12:13,902 --> 02:12:20,739
MATT: Okay. So you have the sword and Whisper
both attuned?

1885
02:12:20,739 --> 02:12:22,310
LIAM: Yeah. But this is the sword.

1886
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:23,897
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1887
02:12:23,897 --> 02:12:29,213
LAURA: He's going to use a legendary. I can see it
on his damn face.

1888
02:12:29,213 --> 02:12:30,826
LIAM: He can't against damage, can he?

1889
02:12:30,826 --> 02:12:32,980
LIAM: All right, well, here we go.

1890
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:34,649
MATT: Can't legendary resist against damage.

1891
02:12:34,649 --> 02:12:35,704
LAURA: You can't?

1892
02:12:35,704 --> 02:12:37,379
MATT: No, it's only against saving throws.

1893
02:12:37,379 --> 02:12:43,002
LIAM: Yeah. So seven. I'll save the bonus for
later. Seven plus the three.

1894
02:12:43,002 --> 02:12:44,841
SAM: Roll high. Roll strong.

1895
02:12:44,841 --> 02:12:59,458
LIAM: Seven, eight, 14, 18, 18 plus all of this.
And I'm smiting, by the way. 18, 21, 24, 26, 30,

1896
02:12:59,458 --> 02:13:16,823
32, 35, 39 plus Hunter's Mark is 42, plus Divine
Smite-- 46. 48 times two is 96.

1897
02:13:16,823 --> 02:13:18,349
MATT: Without the bonus.

1898
02:13:18,349 --> 02:13:21,430
LIAM: Without the bonus, so a hundred and...
two.

1899
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:24,238
MATT: 102 points of damage against Thordak.

1900
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:26,124
LAURA: On your first attack!

1901
02:13:26,124 --> 02:13:37,042
LIAM: For the second attack-- good, this is, yeah,
it hits, 16 plus, 20, 20, 25. This is Whisper, so

1902
02:13:37,042 --> 02:13:41,642
that is one plus-- is nine plus psychic damage...

1903
02:13:41,642 --> 02:13:44,404
LAURA: Can't you just attack twice with the dragon
sword?

1904
02:13:44,404 --> 02:13:45,515
LIAM: No.

1905
02:13:45,515 --> 02:13:46,621
LAURA: Why not?

1906
02:13:46,621 --> 02:13:47,817
LIAM: Hand, hand.

1907
02:13:47,817 --> 02:13:48,702
LAURA: Oh.

1908
02:13:48,702 --> 02:13:50,095
LIAM: 16 for Whisper.

1909
02:13:50,095 --> 02:13:51,135
MATT: All righty.

1910
02:13:51,135 --> 02:13:56,487
LIAM: And I will use my last action, so that was
action, bonus action-- last action to disengage

1911
02:13:56,487 --> 02:14:05,808
and fly down and land by Kima and Gilmore, this
side of the building. Closest to me.

1912
02:14:05,808 --> 02:14:07,312
MATT: Right here?

1913
02:14:07,312 --> 02:14:13,016
LIAM: On the ground, even, if I can, yeah. Behind
the column in the corner by Gilmore's head, I think.

1914
02:14:13,016 --> 02:14:23,534
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up, sword at the side,
jam it to the hilt to the side of Thordak's

1915
02:14:23,534 --> 02:14:30,667
haunch and upper torso area, using the momentum
behind you, you continue to push forward and yank

1916
02:14:30,667 --> 02:14:39,238
the blade around like a can opener. Just cutting
through the scales and hide. (pained yelling) And

1917
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:45,272
as you tear through, the blade, it comes out the
other side, cutting through the flesh as you spin

1918
02:14:45,272 --> 02:14:51,436
around with your wings still out in front, you
spin with Whisper and slam it into the open wound

1919
02:14:51,436 --> 02:14:57,221
with the exposed crystal, hitting the crystal with
the Vestige. (shattering) There's a flash of

1920
02:14:57,221 --> 02:15:02,270
light, and you continue downward, landing off to
that side. As you turn around and look up, you

1921
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:04,810
watch as the crystal begins to crack.
(shattering)

1922
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:06,113
(gasping)

1923
02:15:06,113 --> 02:15:07,743
SAM: It's got a weak spot. Weak spot.

1924
02:15:07,743 --> 02:15:08,795
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1925
02:15:08,795 --> 02:15:10,174
LIAM: Pretty sure I just had an orgasm.

1926
02:15:10,174 --> 02:15:11,495
(laughter)

1927
02:15:11,495 --> 02:15:14,478
SAM: In game, or right here?

1928
02:15:14,478 --> 02:15:16,468
TALIESIN: Could be both now, actually.

1929
02:15:16,468 --> 02:15:18,182
(laughter)

1930
02:15:18,182 --> 02:15:22,854
MATT: All right. That's your turn.

1931
02:15:22,854 --> 02:15:24,434
SAM: You've done your thing.

1932
02:15:24,434 --> 02:15:29,677
LIAM: Take it, take it. Pike cheat sheet, here we
are.

1933
02:15:29,677 --> 02:15:31,089
LAURA: Pike cheat sheet.

1934
02:15:31,089 --> 02:15:37,711
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Pike's turn.

1935
02:15:37,711 --> 02:15:39,746
LAURA: Pike.

1936
02:15:39,746 --> 02:15:42,784
MATT: Pike has to make-- nothing because of the
poison.

1937
02:15:42,784 --> 02:15:43,969
LAURA: Heroes' Feast?

1938
02:15:43,969 --> 02:15:45,345
MATT: Yeah, so, what's Pike doing?

1939
02:15:45,345 --> 02:15:50,478
LAURA: Pike is going to cast Heal on herself at
seventh level. So she's going to heal herself for

1940
02:15:50,478 --> 02:15:51,509
80 points.

1941
02:15:51,509 --> 02:15:52,565
MATT: Okay.

1942
02:15:52,565 --> 02:15:57,512
LAURA: So she's got 84 points now.

1943
02:15:57,512 --> 02:15:59,732
LIAM: She was low.

1944
02:15:59,732 --> 02:16:01,512
LAURA: She was super low.

1945
02:16:01,512 --> 02:16:06,352
TALIESIN: She can take a death, remember. She can
actually take a death. But yeah.

1946
02:16:06,352 --> 02:16:11,964
LAURA: Okay, but then she can't heal people. And
then is anybody injured around her?

1947
02:16:11,964 --> 02:16:14,437
SAM: Everybody's injured around her.

1948
02:16:14,437 --> 02:16:15,947
LAURA: Gilmore's still pretty low, right?

1949
02:16:15,947 --> 02:16:17,484
MATT: Gilmore's not too great.

1950
02:16:17,484 --> 02:16:26,908
LAURA: Okay, then she's going to run, she's going
to cast Healing Word on Gilmore.

1951
02:16:26,908 --> 02:16:28,689
MATT: Okay, he's within range.

1952
02:16:28,689 --> 02:16:30,870
LAURA: At second level that she can do it at?

1953
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:33,048
MATT: Right, so that's 2d4 plus five.

1954
02:16:33,048 --> 02:16:34,852
LAURA: So that's, oh, right, because now shit's
gone.

1955
02:16:34,852 --> 02:16:36,259
MATT: Yeah, Beacon of Hope is gone.

1956
02:16:36,259 --> 02:16:41,462
LAURA: Ten.

1957
02:16:41,462 --> 02:16:44,295
MATT: All right.

1958
02:16:44,295 --> 02:16:49,261
LAURA: And she's going to use her movement to run
back into the building with Scanlan.

1959
02:16:49,261 --> 02:16:56,452
MATT: That's as far as she can get, right there.
Okay, that ends Pike's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

1960
02:16:56,452 --> 02:17:02,813
SAM: Oh. I'll, through the earring, say, Grog, you
want to go for a ride, or no?

1961
02:17:02,813 --> 02:17:05,270
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1962
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:14,952
SAM: Okay, action, I will arc around and Lightning
Bolt the dragon real quick. With the hand cone, I

1963
02:17:14,952 --> 02:17:18,265
don't know if that makes any difference. No, it
doesn't. It might.

1964
02:17:18,265 --> 02:17:20,771
MARISHA: It can't hurt. It's got to save against
that shit.

1965
02:17:20,771 --> 02:17:24,379
MATT: Yeah, you can see it from there. It's high
enough in the sky. You don't have to arc around,

1966
02:17:24,379 --> 02:17:28,537
you can go (magic shooting noise). Okay, makes his
save.

1967
02:17:28,537 --> 02:17:32,267
SAM: Yeah, great, so what, I still roll damage and
he takes half?

1968
02:17:32,267 --> 02:17:33,542
MATT: Yeah. He takes half.

1969
02:17:33,542 --> 02:17:49,290
SAM: Okay. That's fine. 23. So, 12, 11, something
like that.

1970
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:50,488
MATT: Okay.

1971
02:17:50,488 --> 02:17:52,421
SAM: Great.

1972
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:54,209
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

1973
02:17:54,209 --> 02:17:59,828
MARISHA: Good job, buddy. Man, good thing we gave
you that flute.

1974
02:17:59,828 --> 02:18:03,149
LAURA: I know, right, fucking A, Scanlan!

1975
02:18:03,149 --> 02:18:05,313
SAM: We're doing great, guys, nobody's dead yet.

1976
02:18:05,313 --> 02:18:08,667
TALIESIN: It's so great that you did that 11
points.

1977
02:18:08,667 --> 02:18:11,750
MARISHA: Yeah, wait until we're-- he's on the
other side of the continent. It could like--

1978
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:19,061
SAM: And as the bonus action-- The Hand, who is
still alive. He took 102 points of damage, but is

1979
02:18:19,061 --> 02:18:20,808
still alive.

1980
02:18:20,808 --> 02:18:22,005
TRAVIS: Bigby's Hand is?

1981
02:18:22,005 --> 02:18:30,027
SAM: Yes, because he has my hit points. So he'll
go over and lift up Grog by the scruff of his neck

1982
02:18:30,027 --> 02:18:35,781
and go as high and mighty as he can. He can move
like 120 feet, I think.

1983
02:18:35,781 --> 02:18:39,448
TRAVIS: Like a fucking puppy.

1984
02:18:39,448 --> 02:18:42,907
MATT: You can move him up to 60 feet per turn.

1985
02:18:42,907 --> 02:18:45,274
SAM: What? 120! Wait.

1986
02:18:45,274 --> 02:18:49,449
MATT: No, the spell's range is 120. Per turn, as a
bonus action, it can move at 60 feet.

1987
02:18:49,449 --> 02:18:51,892
(laughter)

1988
02:18:51,892 --> 02:18:58,909
SAM: Well, knowing that, I'll just punch the
dragon.

1989
02:18:58,909 --> 02:19:07,200
MATT: Okay. So the hand (whoosh) goes up. Punch
him. Roll a spell attack.

1990
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:08,629
SAM: Nope.

1991
02:19:08,629 --> 02:19:11,336
MATT: Whiffs.

1992
02:19:11,336 --> 02:19:17,657
LAURA: Wait, you're close to Pike. She uses War
God's Blessing to increase your attack by-- can

1993
02:19:17,657 --> 02:19:21,114
she do that? Is it technically an attack that she
could add?

1994
02:19:21,114 --> 02:19:26,963
MATT: Let me check real fast. Let me see here.

1995
02:19:26,963 --> 02:19:30,980
LAURA: Was it really low?

1996
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,673
SAM: I mean, you don't know.

1997
02:19:32,673 --> 02:19:36,524
MATT: Makes an attack roll.

1998
02:19:36,524 --> 02:19:41,456
LAURA: So yeah? So, do I roll the ten, or is it
just a plus ten bonus?

1999
02:19:41,456 --> 02:19:42,666
MATT: Plus ten bonus.

2000
02:19:42,666 --> 02:19:44,709
SAM: Yeah, 23.

2001
02:19:44,709 --> 02:19:47,075
MATT: 23 just hits.

2002
02:19:47,075 --> 02:19:49,144
(cheering)

2003
02:19:49,144 --> 02:19:52,610
SAM: It does hit! 6d8.

2004
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:54,433
MATT: 8d8.

2005
02:19:54,433 --> 02:19:57,263
SAM: No, it's usually 4d8, I think.

2006
02:19:57,263 --> 02:19:59,679
MATT: 4d8, and you cast it, it's usually fifth
level, you cast it as a seventh level.

2007
02:19:59,679 --> 02:20:02,258
SAM: So it's 4d8, so now it's 6d8.

2008
02:20:02,258 --> 02:20:04,019
MATT: It goes up by 2d8 every level higher.

2009
02:20:04,019 --> 02:20:05,075
SAM: Oh, shit!

2010
02:20:05,075 --> 02:20:06,170
LAURA: Oh my god. 4d8?

2011
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:07,319
SAM: No, 8d8.

2012
02:20:07,319 --> 02:20:08,386
LAURA: 8d8?!

2013
02:20:08,386 --> 02:20:12,641
MATT: Yes. Just punched the dragon in the face
with Bigby's Hand.

2014
02:20:12,641 --> 02:20:16,655
SAM: Pike happened. Oh my god, Ashley is the MVP
tonight.

2015
02:20:16,655 --> 02:20:20,348
(laughter)

2016
02:20:20,348 --> 02:20:32,852
SAM: Okay. Not huge, but okay. It's okay. 36.

2017
02:20:32,852 --> 02:20:34,858
LAURA, TRAVIS: That's great!

2018
02:20:34,858 --> 02:20:37,025
MARISHA: That's better than 11.

2019
02:20:37,025 --> 02:20:45,500
SAM: Yeah. Hey, I just dealt 47 points of damage!
That's respectable!

2020
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:49,338
(approving murmurs)

2021
02:20:49,338 --> 02:20:51,883
TRAVIS: How's that Vestige treating you?

2022
02:20:51,883 --> 02:21:06,201
MATT: Top of the next round, Percy. First you
take... You take ten, five points of fire damage.

2023
02:21:06,201 --> 02:21:09,440
SAM: (whispering) Laura.

2024
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:13,248
MATT: That is terrifying. Oh my god.

2025
02:21:13,248 --> 02:21:15,576
LAURA: Thanks for getting my attention for that.

2026
02:21:15,576 --> 02:21:18,510
(laughter)

2027
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:20,002
MATT: Goddamn it.

2028
02:21:20,002 --> 02:21:21,598
SAM: That will inspire you.

2029
02:21:21,598 --> 02:21:23,247
LIAM: Somebody gets an inspiration die.

2030
02:21:23,247 --> 02:21:24,768
(laughter)

2031
02:21:24,768 --> 02:21:28,621
TALIESIN: I'm going to spider-climb-- I'm going to
stay within striking distance, I'm not going to

2032
02:21:28,621 --> 02:21:33,534
disengage from the jerk, but I'm going to climb up
on the wall above him, if that's okay.

2033
02:21:33,534 --> 02:21:39,586
MATT: I'd say yeah, you can do that. The wall next
to him, there's nothing above him.

2034
02:21:39,586 --> 02:21:43,076
TALIESIN: Like, oh, I'm shooting at the
television. Here.

2035
02:21:43,076 --> 02:21:47,978
MATT: Here? So you can move around and get on the
wall.

2036
02:21:47,978 --> 02:21:51,946
TALIESIN: Yeah, like climb up there and be
sideways. I'm going to pull out Bad News, I'm

2037
02:21:51,946 --> 02:21:55,344
going to try something new. I'm seeing that big
spike, there's a big metal spike stuck in his

2038
02:21:55,344 --> 02:21:56,576
chest right now?

2039
02:21:56,576 --> 02:22:01,175
MATT: No, there's no spike. There's a crack in the
crystal that's exposed.

2040
02:22:01,175 --> 02:22:03,331
TALIESIN: Is there still not a metal pole?

2041
02:22:03,331 --> 02:22:04,659
MATT: There's no metal pole.

2042
02:22:04,659 --> 02:22:06,049
TALIESIN: I thought he got hit by a thing.

2043
02:22:06,049 --> 02:22:07,634
MATT: No, he got hit by a Vax.

2044
02:22:07,634 --> 02:22:11,693
TALIESIN: Okay, I thought he also got hit by a
thing. But that's okay. I'm going to try something

2045
02:22:11,693 --> 02:22:17,066
weird. I'm going to spend a grit for advantage on
this shot, because--

2046
02:22:17,066 --> 02:22:19,464
SAM: "Constructing a pole vault."

2047
02:22:19,464 --> 02:22:21,923
TALIESIN: I'm going to add two points of Cabal's
Ruin to this.

2048
02:22:21,923 --> 02:22:23,232
MATT: Okay.

2049
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,381
SAM: What does that do? What? You have a thing?

2050
02:22:25,381 --> 02:22:27,615
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend two points of Cabal's
Ruin. I have a thing.

2051
02:22:27,615 --> 02:22:29,245
MATT: You can spend them once you roll to hit.

2052
02:22:29,245 --> 02:22:30,811
TALIESIN: Oh, I can wait until after?

2053
02:22:30,811 --> 02:22:32,648
MATT: Wait until you see you hit it, then you can
spend the points.

2054
02:22:32,648 --> 02:22:39,735
TALIESIN: Well, that's even better. So first shot
is a 27 to hit.

2055
02:22:39,735 --> 02:22:41,318
MATT: That hits.

2056
02:22:41,318 --> 02:22:46,210
TALIESIN: So I'm going to drop two-- I've got the
little thing running through my glove, I've got

2057
02:22:46,210 --> 02:22:51,215
the wire. I'm just going to let go of the little
grounding wire and see what happens. I'll hold

2058
02:22:51,289 --> 02:22:56,257
onto the barrel and pray. Let's add 2d6 to that.
Is that right? Yeah.

2059
02:22:56,535 --> 02:22:57,372
LIAM: I really like this spider-climb guy.

2060
02:22:57,372 --> 02:23:05,535
TALIESIN: I know, I'm digging this-- augh, it's
okay. Yeah, this is okay. 22 points of damage plus

2061
02:23:05,535 --> 02:23:07,457
two points of electrical damage.

2062
02:23:07,457 --> 02:23:08,797
MATT: Okay.

2063
02:23:08,797 --> 02:23:10,642
SAM: Did you roll your Cabal's Ruin thing?

2064
02:23:10,642 --> 02:23:15,502
TALIESIN: I did, yeah, I did, I'm going to do that
again.

2065
02:23:15,502 --> 02:23:16,486
MATT: Okay.

2066
02:23:16,486 --> 02:23:17,889
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn two more points--
Well, I'm going to wait. That's really cool, that

2067
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:19,193
I can wait.

2068
02:23:19,193 --> 02:23:23,110
LAURA: That was the softest little roll.

2069
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:25,528
TALIESIN: I hate it when that happens. I know,
that was the worst roll I've ever done. That's

2070
02:23:25,528 --> 02:23:28,740
okay. It's 22. Just hits?

2071
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:29,877
MATT: 22 misses.

2072
02:23:29,877 --> 02:23:36,237
TALIESIN: 22 misses?! That's fine. I'm not going
to burn any Cabal. So that's fine.

2073
02:23:36,237 --> 02:23:47,649
MATT: The first blast fires off... It impacts the
side of Thordak. You watch the little charge of

2074
02:23:47,649 --> 02:23:52,951
energy shoot through. Second shot, however, goes a
little wide, as you feel the fire still burning up

2075
02:23:52,951 --> 02:23:56,347
the front of your torso. It's enough to distract
you from your actual aiming.

2076
02:23:56,347 --> 02:23:58,276
TALIESIN: That was very cool, though.

2077
02:23:58,276 --> 02:24:00,105
MARISHA: You can do that.

2078
02:24:00,105 --> 02:24:04,529
TALIESIN: Once I set it up, I can arc a charge to
the bullet.

2079
02:24:04,529 --> 02:24:08,187
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Percy?

2080
02:24:08,187 --> 02:24:13,466
TALIESIN: That ends my turn. I may drop back
behind-- No, I'm good, I'm good.

2081
02:24:13,466 --> 02:24:26,507
MATT: At this point, the ground quakes beneath--

2082
02:24:26,507 --> 02:24:34,374
TALIESIN: That was a terrible roll. Terrible
roll.

2083
02:24:34,374 --> 02:24:35,892
MARISHA: Yes, it was.

2084
02:24:35,892 --> 02:24:37,539
TALIESIN: Snake eyes was not cool.

2085
02:24:37,539 --> 02:24:45,296
MATT: No, he can't do the same twice in a row, so
it's going to do another magma erupt. (laughs)

2086
02:24:45,296 --> 02:24:53,425
Beneath where Gilmore is, the ground splits
open--

2087
02:24:53,425 --> 02:24:54,954
(groans)

2088
02:24:54,954 --> 02:25:00,086
MATT: --and another burst of magma billows out
from underneath. Going against Kima, Vax, that's

2089
02:25:00,086 --> 02:25:04,043
where most of them are clustered. Kima, Vax, and
Gilmore. I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

2090
02:25:04,043 --> 02:25:05,629
LIAM: Yeah, evasion for me.

2091
02:25:05,629 --> 02:25:07,588
TALIESIN: Walls hate NPCs.

2092
02:25:07,588 --> 02:25:13,608
LIAM: With advantage. 18 for me.

2093
02:25:13,608 --> 02:25:21,496
MATT: 18 for you. All right, that's okay. Gilmore
rolls a--

2094
02:25:21,496 --> 02:25:23,093
LAURA: Natural 20?

2095
02:25:23,093 --> 02:25:27,584
MATT: 15, which is enough. Kima rolls a natural
20--

2096
02:25:27,584 --> 02:25:29,205
(cheering)

2097
02:25:29,205 --> 02:25:33,521
MATT: So half as much damage to each of you guys.
You take none.

2098
02:25:33,521 --> 02:25:37,737
LIAM: I'm sitting pretty. I mean, I'm really
rough.

2099
02:25:37,737 --> 02:25:39,711
LAURA: Don't say that out loud.

2100
02:25:39,711 --> 02:25:41,615
SAM: Have you taken any damage?

2101
02:25:41,615 --> 02:25:44,376
MATT: That's 21, that's ten points of fire damage
to both Kima and Gilmore.

2102
02:25:44,376 --> 02:25:46,432
TALIESIN: Halved?

2103
02:25:46,432 --> 02:25:48,797
MATT: That was halved.

2104
02:25:48,797 --> 02:25:51,313
LIAM: I am Borishnakoffing all over this
battlefield.

2105
02:25:51,313 --> 02:25:54,544
TALIESIN: Somebody's going to dive into that
hole.

2106
02:25:54,544 --> 02:26:05,735
MATT: As that bursts off, you also watch as the
airship Deera coasts around this way and takes

2107
02:26:05,735 --> 02:26:06,961
three shots.

2108
02:26:06,961 --> 02:26:09,572
(cheering)

2109
02:26:09,572 --> 02:26:20,158
MATT: Misses. Hits! And misses. So three of them
shoot past. The third one impacts for seven points

2110
02:26:20,158 --> 02:26:27,391
of piercing damage to Thordak. You watch as two
other wyverns get cut down from the edges of the

2111
02:26:27,391 --> 02:26:35,473
ship, slamming into the ground near you. Their
arms curl up, and the wings fall limply to the

2112
02:26:35,473 --> 02:26:45,047
side. You also hear a slamming sound as from a
nearby wall, you watch as a fire giant that has

2113
02:26:45,047 --> 02:26:47,742
climbed over the edge of the wall.

2114
02:26:47,742 --> 02:26:51,349
LAURA: Why would you bring more things onto the
battlefield?!

2115
02:26:51,349 --> 02:26:53,100
MATT: It charges into the fray, this way.

2116
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:54,880
MARISHA: Wait, over what wall, over what wall?

2117
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,664
MATT: On the outside of the side of the Cloudtop.

2118
02:26:56,664 --> 02:26:58,505
SAM: Is this one of the fire giants we've seen?

2119
02:26:58,505 --> 02:27:01,938
MARISHA: Yeah, is this one that Zahra and Kash
were guarding?

2120
02:27:01,938 --> 02:27:04,276
MATT: Make a perception check.

2121
02:27:04,276 --> 02:27:06,638
MARISHA: Can I do it?

2122
02:27:06,638 --> 02:27:09,491
MATT: You barely have a view of it, so yes, you
can.

2123
02:27:09,491 --> 02:27:10,833
LAURA: Do I have a view of it?

2124
02:27:10,833 --> 02:27:12,439
MATT: No, you're inside the room.

2125
02:27:12,439 --> 02:27:13,888
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, 25.

2126
02:27:13,888 --> 02:27:17,920
MATT: You see it, this one does not appear to be
coming from the direction they were.

2127
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,604
LAURA: That's good, that's good. That's not a damn
it, that's a good.

2128
02:27:20,604 --> 02:27:22,951
MARISHA: Means they're still alive. Hopefully?

2129
02:27:22,951 --> 02:27:30,595
MATT: With that, it is Raishan's turn. Raishan
gets her breath back.

2130
02:27:30,595 --> 02:27:33,736
TRAVIS: (singing) Girl, get your breath back.

2131
02:27:33,736 --> 02:27:37,909
MATT: Raishan rears back, (hissing roar) releases
the same poisonous torrent toward Thordak.

2132
02:27:37,909 --> 02:27:41,785
TRAVIS: Halitosis is a bitch.

2133
02:27:41,785 --> 02:27:45,689
SAM: We have exactly one ally dragon in this fight
right now.

2134
02:27:45,689 --> 02:27:50,740
TRAVIS: I will fucking-- I will pop all your
knuckles.

2135
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,252
SAM: We do! She's great.

2136
02:27:52,252 --> 02:27:56,376
LIAM: The last thing we'll do in this fight is
all turn on you.

2137
02:27:56,376 --> 02:28:01,891
MARISHA: The last thing we do is die as we see a
bronze dragon show up.

2138
02:28:01,891 --> 02:28:05,688
LAURA: Yeah, we're all dead on the ground, and
Scanlan's like, yay!

2139
02:28:05,688 --> 02:28:11,228
MATT: He takes half damage as the poison cloud
billows up, (cough, sinister growl).

2140
02:28:11,228 --> 02:28:12,967
SAM: Aw, he's still crazy.

2141
02:28:12,967 --> 02:28:24,917
MATT: "You're still around us? That's okay.
There's still time... to eat." Raishan is going to

2142
02:28:24,917 --> 02:28:31,934
fly past and land on the top of the roof, which
nearly crumbles. Nearly crumbles above you,

2143
02:28:31,934 --> 02:28:36,526
Keyleth, you feel stones (crash) around you, and
you see Raishan landing on the ceiling of this

2144
02:28:36,526 --> 02:28:38,714
damaged building as parts of it begin to
collapse.

2145
02:28:38,714 --> 02:28:41,257
LAURA: Look how little she is.

2146
02:28:41,257 --> 02:28:44,539
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn. Keyleth, you're
up.

2147
02:28:44,539 --> 02:28:45,968
LIAM: Go, girl.

2148
02:28:45,968 --> 02:28:57,938
MARISHA: So she's on top of me, more or less? I'm
going to turn around and Tidal Wave this elemental

2149
02:28:57,938 --> 02:28:59,385
behind me.

2150
02:28:59,385 --> 02:29:00,763
MATT: Okay.

2151
02:29:00,763 --> 02:29:06,731
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if I'm caught in the
corner of this, will this extinguish me?

2152
02:29:06,731 --> 02:29:10,155
MARISHA: Extinguishes all flames.

2153
02:29:10,155 --> 02:29:14,477
MATT: It does. Wait, so what spell are you doing?
You're doing--

2154
02:29:14,477 --> 02:29:15,957
TRAVIS: Tidal Wave.

2155
02:29:15,957 --> 02:29:18,658
LAURA: Is that one, like, still up or something?
Is it like a concentration that just lasts?

2156
02:29:18,658 --> 02:29:25,681
MARISHA: No, the other one was Tsunami. That one
is like the big daddy version of this one. Yeah.

2157
02:29:25,681 --> 02:29:28,149
MATT: So, Percy, I need you to make a dexterity
saving throw.

2158
02:29:28,149 --> 02:29:31,732
TALIESIN: Can I autofail if I just want to be--
Oh, that's right, for half damage.

2159
02:29:31,732 --> 02:29:33,063
MATT: Yes.

2160
02:29:33,063 --> 02:29:39,170
TALIESIN: All right. Dex saving throw. That's an
11.

2161
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:48,343
MATT: So roll 4d8 bludgeoning damage. Percy takes,
and Percy is knocked prone, but is no longer on fire.

2162
02:29:48,343 --> 02:29:53,015
TALIESIN: I just fall on the ground, I assume.

2163
02:29:53,015 --> 02:29:56,266
MARISHA: Sorry, Percy. I'm saving your life, man!

2164
02:29:56,266 --> 02:30:06,245
MATT: However, the unscathed fire elemental is
turned to mist. Water pushing past and doing way

2165
02:30:06,245 --> 02:30:07,784
too much damage for him to--

2166
02:30:07,784 --> 02:30:14,386
MARISHA: Is this damage for Percy? 21.

2167
02:30:14,386 --> 02:30:15,927
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth.

2168
02:30:15,927 --> 02:30:20,933
(laughter)

2169
02:30:20,933 --> 02:30:22,732
LIAM: Legitimately though!

2170
02:30:22,732 --> 02:30:29,219
MATT: But a full health fire elemental is turned
to mist and is immediately destroyed. Actually,

2171
02:30:29,219 --> 02:30:33,979
the force of it blows out the rocks from this side
of the wall. And the wall, the wall here actually

2172
02:30:33,979 --> 02:30:42,033
gets knocked open to that side as the tidal wave
pushes out. Keyleth, do you want to move or stay

2173
02:30:42,033 --> 02:30:43,504
where you are?

2174
02:30:43,504 --> 02:30:53,860
MARISHA: I'll pop myself out of the door a little
bit.

2175
02:30:53,860 --> 02:30:55,230
MATT: Okay.

2176
02:30:55,230 --> 02:31:01,068
SAM: What's that other thing that you've been
doing to him? That he has to save on every once in

2177
02:31:01,068 --> 02:31:02,131
a while?

2178
02:31:02,131 --> 02:31:03,387
LAURA: Oh, Contagion?

2179
02:31:03,387 --> 02:31:06,358
MARISHA: Contagion, he has to do that at the end
of his turn. Did he do it at the last...?

2180
02:31:06,358 --> 02:31:08,586
MATT: He did, yes. It was a 13 plus...

2181
02:31:08,586 --> 02:31:12,372
MARISHA: So he's saved against two or one?

2182
02:31:12,372 --> 02:31:14,985
MATT: He's only done two, so far, since you cast
it.

2183
02:31:14,985 --> 02:31:19,265
MARISHA: He's only done-- I know about one.

2184
02:31:19,265 --> 02:31:23,459
MATT: No, because you didn't do it your first
turn, you did it your second turn, so yeah, twice.

2185
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:25,145
LAURA: Yeah, he's definitely done it twice.

2186
02:31:25,145 --> 02:31:26,983
MARISHA: And he's saved against both? Are you
sure?

2187
02:31:26,983 --> 02:31:28,071
MATT: Yes.

2188
02:31:28,071 --> 02:31:29,085
MARISHA: All right.

2189
02:31:29,085 --> 02:31:30,782
SAM: But are you <i>sure</i>?

2190
02:31:30,782 --> 02:31:31,702
MATT: Yes.

2191
02:31:31,702 --> 02:31:33,401
(laughter)

2192
02:31:33,401 --> 02:31:35,117
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

2193
02:31:35,117 --> 02:31:37,584
MARISHA: Do I see Gilmore?

2194
02:31:37,584 --> 02:31:40,703
MATT: You, from your current perspective, you do
not.

2195
02:31:40,703 --> 02:31:42,188
MARISHA: Then, yeah.

2196
02:31:42,188 --> 02:31:45,789
MATT: Okay. Jarett, who is currently scared out of
his wits.

2197
02:31:45,789 --> 02:31:48,086
TRAVIS: Get your shit together, man.

2198
02:31:48,086 --> 02:31:50,089
SAM: Jarett, do you need some suude?

2199
02:31:50,089 --> 02:31:51,334
TRAVIS: Spice?

2200
02:31:51,334 --> 02:31:55,532
MATT: Ha, He's like, "What? No, why would you..."

2201
02:31:55,532 --> 02:31:57,309
SAM: Well, you look crazy right now.

2202
02:31:57,309 --> 02:32:00,024
MATT: "Look at that!"

2203
02:32:00,024 --> 02:32:02,776
SAM: It's like a Thursday.

2204
02:32:02,776 --> 02:32:09,763
MATT: And he goes and takes two more shots, with
disadvantage against. That's a miss. Second shot,

2205
02:32:09,763 --> 02:32:15,130
disadvantage. Is a miss. Both shots firing off.

2206
02:32:15,130 --> 02:32:18,781
TRAVIS: We'll remember this. Your annual review's coming
up.

2207
02:32:18,781 --> 02:32:21,689
SAM: Needs improvement.

2208
02:32:21,689 --> 02:32:38,857
MATT: Gilmore, who's now conscious, doesn't have a
whole lot else as far as attack spells go, is

2209
02:32:38,857 --> 02:32:44,396
going to attempt to stand up. "All right, that
was--"

2210
02:32:44,396 --> 02:32:47,013
(groaning)

2211
02:32:47,013 --> 02:32:48,742
LIAM: Matt, why would you!

2212
02:32:48,742 --> 02:32:50,105
SAM: He flew 30 feet.

2213
02:32:50,105 --> 02:32:52,582
MATT: I can count that.

2214
02:32:52,582 --> 02:32:54,766
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No!

2215
02:32:54,766 --> 02:32:56,616
MATT: Then stop giving me shit.

2216
02:32:56,616 --> 02:32:59,200
LIAM: Why would you!

2217
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:05,594
MATT: As he gets up, he leans back and backs out of
the rubble, takes in his surroundings, sees the

2218
02:33:05,594 --> 02:33:12,357
magma receding from the crack in the ground. "This
is... You guys bring me to the greatest places.

2219
02:33:12,357 --> 02:33:18,265
"Oh, he's not looking too good." And releases a
Lightning Bolt.

2220
02:33:18,265 --> 02:33:20,224
MARISHA: He's not looking too good?

2221
02:33:20,224 --> 02:33:25,545
MATT: He's not looking too good. And he's going to
release a Lightning Bolt at fifth level. A

2222
02:33:25,545 --> 02:33:34,449
5th-level Lightning Bolt. A 5th-level Lightning
Bolt. Thordak makes his save. And that will be,

2223
02:33:34,449 --> 02:33:53,534
come on, dice. 49. Half that will be 24 points of
lightning damage against Thordak. That ends

2224
02:33:53,534 --> 02:33:56,852
Gilmore's turn. Grog and Thordak.

2225
02:33:56,852 --> 02:33:58,851
TRAVIS: Oh God. I'm going first.

2226
02:33:58,851 --> 02:34:00,206
MATT: All right, what are you doing?

2227
02:34:00,206 --> 02:34:05,145
TRAVIS: Because it's so insignificant. I'm going
to attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning

2228
02:34:05,145 --> 02:34:06,846
and throw it at his foot.

2229
02:34:06,846 --> 02:34:08,958
TALIESIN: You could go in the hole, just saying.

2230
02:34:08,958 --> 02:34:10,645
TRAVIS: I thought we didn't care about the hole?

2231
02:34:10,645 --> 02:34:11,722
TALIESIN: I care about the hole.

2232
02:34:11,722 --> 02:34:13,020
TRAVIS: Grog <i>loves</i> going in holes.

2233
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:15,455
LAURA: Just do what you're going to do.

2234
02:34:15,455 --> 02:34:17,013
TRAVIS: All right, I throw the Bloodaxe.

2235
02:34:17,013 --> 02:34:21,359
SAM: You can also hold your attack until he's
closer or something?

2236
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:29,778
TRAVIS: Reckless! Yeah, that's not going to
happen. 31.

2237
02:34:29,778 --> 02:34:31,869
MATT: 31.

2238
02:34:31,869 --> 02:34:43,086
TRAVIS: It's not Great Weapon Master. That's a 12.
That's good. Two points of necrotic for 27 and I'm

2239
02:34:43,086 --> 02:34:45,359
enlarged! And that's another one.

2240
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:47,169
SAM: Hey, 28 is great!

2241
02:34:47,169 --> 02:34:49,218
TRAVIS: Hey, matzoh ball in your face.

2242
02:34:49,218 --> 02:34:50,589
MATT: That's awesome.

2243
02:34:50,589 --> 02:34:52,228
TRAVIS: And then I've got to pull it back.

2244
02:34:52,228 --> 02:34:54,270
TALIESIN: With advantage.

2245
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:56,405
TRAVIS: Seven plus 14, woo! Got it.

2246
02:34:56,405 --> 02:34:57,993
MATT: Yeah. You pull the axe back.

2247
02:34:57,993 --> 02:35:03,253
SAM: You got a bonus action or something?

2248
02:35:03,253 --> 02:35:04,847
LAURA: You could attack again?

2249
02:35:04,847 --> 02:35:07,049
TRAVIS: No I can't, I can only throw it once.

2250
02:35:07,049 --> 02:35:08,891
MATT: Thordak is going to swoop in.

2251
02:35:08,891 --> 02:35:11,018
SAM: You could heal or something? You've got
potions and shit, don't you?

2252
02:35:11,018 --> 02:35:15,825
LAURA: Can't you hold your other attack until he
moves?

2253
02:35:15,825 --> 02:35:17,519
TRAVIS: I don't have another attack.

2254
02:35:17,519 --> 02:35:19,143
MATT: Let's see here.

2255
02:35:19,143 --> 02:35:20,770
LIAM: He's hesitating.

2256
02:35:20,770 --> 02:35:25,580
TRAVIS: It takes my whole action. I get two
attacks in an action.

2257
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:39,690
SAM: He's hovering. God, he's going to his other
Dungeons &amp; Dragons game!

2258
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:41,041
(laughter)

2259
02:35:41,041 --> 02:35:43,065
LAURA: He's like, welp, I'm over this.

2260
02:35:43,065 --> 02:35:46,388
SAM: Oh God! That's dangerously close.

2261
02:35:46,388 --> 02:35:49,237
MATT: I know.

2262
02:35:49,237 --> 02:35:50,446
LAURA: Oh god.

2263
02:35:50,446 --> 02:35:52,374
MATT: Right there, Gilmore just behind.

2264
02:35:52,374 --> 02:35:53,861
LAURA: Gilmore is up his butt.

2265
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:56,869
MATT: Raishan right there. Lands right up next to
Pike.

2266
02:35:56,869 --> 02:35:58,053
LAURA: No!

2267
02:35:58,053 --> 02:35:59,836
MATT: Everyone else in that vicinity.

2268
02:35:59,836 --> 02:36:01,843
LAURA: Oh no, that's Pike and Scanlan isn't it?

2269
02:36:01,843 --> 02:36:02,847
SAM: Oh boy.

2270
02:36:02,847 --> 02:36:08,260
MATT: Yup. And (inhales).

2271
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:11,850
LAURA: What? Why would you do that to Pike?!

2272
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:17,676
MATT: Rolled a five on that. Because Pike keeps
healing everybody. That'll be towards Jarett,

2273
02:36:17,676 --> 02:36:20,088
Scanlan and Pike. I need you guys to make dex
saves.

2274
02:36:20,088 --> 02:36:21,509
SAM: I'll Cutting Words this.

2275
02:36:21,509 --> 02:36:24,080
MATT: How many more bardic inspiration dice do you
have by the way?

2276
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,000
SAM: I have used only three. That means I have
three left.

2277
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,407
MATT: You've inspired one and you've Cutting Words
twice? Correct, all right, cool. This is your fourth?

2278
02:36:29,407 --> 02:36:35,230
SAM: Yep. So I will Cutting Words that up with a
poem I will make up on the spot. Roses are red,

2279
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:41,665
Violets are blue, I'm a gnome, and you're an
asshole.

2280
02:36:41,665 --> 02:36:44,345
(laughter)

2281
02:36:44,345 --> 02:36:48,875
MATT: Roll a d12. What was Pike's dexterity save
again?

2282
02:36:48,875 --> 02:36:50,688
LIAM: Oh no, it's this die.

2283
02:36:50,688 --> 02:36:53,658
SAM: Oh, you can reduce that by one point, Matt
Mercer.

2284
02:36:53,658 --> 02:36:59,015
MATT: (laughing) Oh no. What did you get? Nah,
roll your dexterity saving throw.

2285
02:36:59,015 --> 02:37:03,475
SAM: My dexterity saving throw. Terrible, 15.

2286
02:37:03,475 --> 02:37:05,553
MATT: Jarett does not make it either.

2287
02:37:05,553 --> 02:37:07,790
LIAM: Big eight, big eight.

2288
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:09,460
MATT: All right, well.

2289
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:13,442
LAURA: One of our Jaeger controllers did worse
than our other--

2290
02:37:13,442 --> 02:37:16,759
LIAM: You shut your pie hole! Hear me, half-elf?

2291
02:37:16,759 --> 02:37:20,558
MATT: Well, with the damage reduction from Scanlan
that's only 100 points of fire damage.

2292
02:37:20,558 --> 02:37:22,309
TALIESIN: Cut in half.

2293
02:37:22,309 --> 02:37:31,065
MATT: Cut in half, so that's 50 to each of you.
Jarett is practically immolated. His unconscious

2294
02:37:31,065 --> 02:37:39,265
body hits the ground, crisp, smoking. He's
currently going into shock and is in a really bad

2295
02:37:39,265 --> 02:37:40,848
place right now.

2296
02:37:40,848 --> 02:37:42,747
SAM: Where's Pike? What's Pike doing?

2297
02:37:42,747 --> 02:37:48,143
LAURA: Pike is-- Wait, minus 50. She's at 50
minus--she's at 34 points right now.

2298
02:37:48,143 --> 02:37:54,394
TALIESIN: In combat range of a dragon.

2299
02:37:54,394 --> 02:37:59,385
TRAVIS: I never finished my turn, so can I use my
movement now? Since we're on the same, can I chase

2300
02:37:59,385 --> 02:38:03,356
him back to where he landed? 50 feet and how far
does that get me?

2301
02:38:03,356 --> 02:38:05,155
MATT: Yeah, you can get right up behind him right
there.

2302
02:38:05,155 --> 02:38:06,708
LAURA: Can you attack him now?

2303
02:38:06,708 --> 02:38:13,048
TRAVIS: Nah. Nah. Actually, my bonus action is
still there and I am frenzied.

2304
02:38:13,048 --> 02:38:14,851
MATT: Yes, you are.

2305
02:38:14,851 --> 02:38:15,944
TRAVIS: Can I attack?

2306
02:38:15,944 --> 02:38:16,992
MATT: Sure.

2307
02:38:16,992 --> 02:38:18,167
TRAVIS: I'll do it Reckless.

2308
02:38:18,167 --> 02:38:19,916
MATT: I'll let you do it. It all happened at
once.

2309
02:38:19,916 --> 02:38:23,142
TRAVIS: 29?

2310
02:38:23,142 --> 02:38:24,988
MATT: 29 hits.

2311
02:38:24,988 --> 02:38:37,675
TRAVIS: Yeah, not Great Weapon Master. Nine plus
two, 26, 29. 29.

2312
02:38:37,675 --> 02:38:45,238
MATT: 29? All righty. That ends your turn.

2313
02:38:45,238 --> 02:38:46,390
TRAVIS: That does.

2314
02:38:46,390 --> 02:38:52,316
SAM: Matt, in the interest of honor, should I roll
a concentration saving throw?

2315
02:38:52,316 --> 02:38:54,023
MATT: Oh yes, you should. Sorry, thank you.

2316
02:38:54,023 --> 02:38:56,087
SAM: I rolled a-- what do I add to it?

2317
02:38:56,087 --> 02:39:00,317
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, so you add
your constitution save.

2318
02:39:00,317 --> 02:39:03,504
SAM: Constitution? So 18.

2319
02:39:03,504 --> 02:39:10,845
MATT: With that, Bigby's Hand fades, the spell
knocked asunder. Thank you for reminding me of

2320
02:39:10,845 --> 02:39:15,148
that. So that comes to end that turn.

2321
02:39:15,148 --> 02:39:17,398
MARISHA: He has to roll a save.

2322
02:39:17,398 --> 02:39:22,208
MATT: Yes, he does. And that is a seven plus 16.

2323
02:39:22,208 --> 02:39:24,170
MARISHA: Does he still have disadvantage on
these?

2324
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:28,534
MATT: No, he doesn't have disadvantage on every
save, just the one. He was Cutting Words'd, you're right.

2325
02:39:28,534 --> 02:39:33,436
MARISHA: Yeah. He has to roll under a five.

2326
02:39:33,436 --> 02:39:35,702
MATT: Same thing. So with that, the third save is
made, Contagion.

2327
02:39:35,702 --> 02:39:40,562
SAM: At least it won't eat up my Cutting Words any
more.

2328
02:39:40,562 --> 02:39:48,060
MARISHA: It's resting in peace with my 8th-level
spell and her dragon-slaying arrow. They're in a

2329
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:49,315
puddle somewhere.

2330
02:39:49,315 --> 02:39:50,889
MATT: It's a rough couple rounds.

2331
02:39:50,889 --> 02:39:56,030
LAURA: Did I see where that dragon-slaying arrow
sailed off to?

2332
02:39:56,030 --> 02:40:04,209
MATT: With the sheer amount of clouds of ash and
blackness in the air, you have no idea where it

2333
02:40:04,209 --> 02:40:12,981
went, I'm afraid. At the end of Thordak's turn,
the wyvern that had seen you, it did spot you.

2334
02:40:12,981 --> 02:40:18,291
Your stealth was not very good. It leaps down into
the back of the building and (growls) coming

2335
02:40:18,291 --> 02:40:28,076
towards you. The wyvern's going to make a
multi-attack. The first is a bite attack against

2336
02:40:28,076 --> 02:40:36,610
you. That's a natural one. Does not hit you. The
stinger, however, is a natural 20. Wow! So that is

2337
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:44,088
for 12 points of piercing damage to you and I need
you to make a constitution saving throw.

2338
02:40:44,088 --> 02:40:46,119
LIAM and TALIESIN: Poison immunity.

2339
02:40:46,119 --> 02:40:47,876
MATT: That's right. So no effect.

2340
02:40:47,876 --> 02:40:49,106
LAURA: 12 points of damage.

2341
02:40:49,106 --> 02:41:01,687
MATT: The rider is going to swing at you with a
heavy club and then a javelin. That is a 16.

2342
02:41:01,687 --> 02:41:03,495
What's your AC?

2343
02:41:03,495 --> 02:41:04,690
LAURA: 21.

2344
02:41:04,690 --> 02:41:15,886
MATT: Nope. And no. Misses you with both. You're
just too quick for him. The giant sees Percy lying

2345
02:41:15,886 --> 02:41:25,396
on the ground and goes (yells). With its giant
two-handed sword, it's going to make two attacks

2346
02:41:25,396 --> 02:41:33,066
against Percy with advantage. 19, so that's 30 for
the first one.

2347
02:41:33,066 --> 02:41:34,967
TALIESIN: Oh, that just hits.

2348
02:41:34,967 --> 02:41:38,189
MATT: And a 22 with the second.

2349
02:41:38,189 --> 02:41:39,657
TALIESIN: That also just hits.

2350
02:41:39,657 --> 02:41:44,210
MATT: All right. So you take 28 points of slashing
damage from each hit.

2351
02:41:44,210 --> 02:41:48,022
TALIESIN: So that's 28 times two.

2352
02:41:48,022 --> 02:41:49,822
LAURA: 56.

2353
02:41:49,822 --> 02:41:55,250
TALIESIN: 56. All right, that's fine. I blame you
for all of this.

2354
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:57,195
SAM: We're getting in flute range soon.

2355
02:41:57,195 --> 02:42:03,053
TALIESIN: I'll be hearing about it from the
kitchen. It'll be great. I'll be working on my new

2356
02:42:03,053 --> 02:42:04,482
character.

2357
02:42:04,482 --> 02:42:09,843
MATT: All right. That brings us to--

2358
02:42:09,843 --> 02:42:11,283
SAM: Raishan?

2359
02:42:11,283 --> 02:42:16,688
MATT: No. That brings us to Vex's turn.

2360
02:42:16,688 --> 02:42:19,068
LAURA: I can't see anything about where I am.

2361
02:42:19,068 --> 02:42:20,223
MATT: You're back here right now.

2362
02:42:20,223 --> 02:42:21,906
LAURA: Yeah, I can't see that on the screen, so I
don't know.

2363
02:42:21,906 --> 02:42:27,468
LIAM: Other side of that building.

2364
02:42:27,468 --> 02:42:31,988
LAURA: Can I use disengage to get away from the
wyvern?

2365
02:42:31,988 --> 02:42:33,554
MATT: Yeah.

2366
02:42:33,554 --> 02:42:41,198
LAURA: I'm going to do that and I'll run out
somewhere. Where's the laser pointer?

2367
02:42:41,198 --> 02:42:44,975
LIAM: I can't see where Vex is at all.

2368
02:42:44,975 --> 02:42:47,029
LAURA: I just have no clue where I am.

2369
02:42:47,029 --> 02:42:49,434
MATT: Well, I have you right here because you
actually fell and your base came off and I glued

2370
02:42:49,434 --> 02:42:51,813
it together when you were talking.

2371
02:42:51,813 --> 02:42:54,862
LAURA: No way! Oh, I thought you said the face.

2372
02:42:54,862 --> 02:42:57,373
SAM: He has crazy glue on his person?

2373
02:42:57,373 --> 02:43:00,910
MATT: Like any good dungeon master should. So
you're inside this building right now.

2374
02:43:00,910 --> 02:43:11,809
LAURA: If I'm hasted, does that affect my broom?

2375
02:43:11,809 --> 02:43:13,132
MATT: No.

2376
02:43:13,132 --> 02:43:15,320
LAURA: So I just run out.

2377
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:20,553
MATT: So you just run out this way. You have a lot
of movement speed, so you're still out here at

2378
02:43:20,553 --> 02:43:22,471
half movement.

2379
02:43:22,471 --> 02:43:28,751
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to run through the
building and under Raishan and shoot up at Thordak

2380
02:43:28,751 --> 02:43:30,391
from through the building.

2381
02:43:30,391 --> 02:43:33,611
LIAM: Ditch the broom.

2382
02:43:33,611 --> 02:43:36,121
MATT: Go for it. Make your shots.

2383
02:43:36,121 --> 02:43:51,321
LAURA: Okay. Oh no, that one doesn't hit. Okay,
second one. Okay, that hits. That's 29.

2384
02:43:51,321 --> 02:43:53,644
MATT: 29. All right.

2385
02:43:53,644 --> 02:43:56,063
LAURA: Can I do that with a poison arrow? I should
have said that before.

2386
02:43:56,063 --> 02:43:57,567
MATT: You should have said that before.

2387
02:43:57,567 --> 02:44:22,520
LAURA: Never mind. 18, that's with four lightning.
I do get sneak attack right now. 15 more.

2388
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:29,865
MATT: Okay. That was the first roll. Second
attack?

2389
02:44:29,865 --> 02:44:35,280
LAURA: Yeah. Should I do the second dragon attack? I'm
so scared to use the dragon arrow.

2390
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:42,913
TRAVIS: There is no tomorrow. There's a giant
fucking dragon and a fire giant.

2391
02:44:42,913 --> 02:44:46,087
LIAM: Pop his head off in one shot. Go.

2392
02:44:46,087 --> 02:44:56,109
LAURA: I'm going to use my dragon arrow. My
last one. Oh, good! That was so close but it

2393
02:44:56,109 --> 02:44:57,681
definitely hit.

2394
02:44:57,681 --> 02:44:59,042
MATT: Okay.

2395
02:44:59,042 --> 02:45:08,672
LAURA: Oh God. Okay. 17 with one lightning.

2396
02:45:08,672 --> 02:45:11,462
MATT: One lightning damage. All right.

2397
02:45:11,462 --> 02:45:23,873
LAURA: So three more. And how many do I add
for the dragon arrow?

2398
02:45:23,873 --> 02:45:25,372
MATT: I'm looking it up right now, actually.

2399
02:45:25,372 --> 02:45:26,672
SAM: Ooh!

2400
02:45:26,672 --> 02:45:28,717
LAURA: I think it's 10d6. I think.

2401
02:45:28,717 --> 02:45:30,191
SAM: Is it really?

2402
02:45:30,191 --> 02:45:32,815
LAURA: Or 6d10. It's one of those two.

2403
02:45:32,815 --> 02:45:34,243
SAM: 10d20.

2404
02:45:34,243 --> 02:45:38,110
LAURA: 10d20. 12d12.

2405
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:43,540
TRAVIS: 100d100s. And the universe implodes.

2406
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:45,651
MATT: DC 17 constitution saving throw.

2407
02:45:45,651 --> 02:45:47,813
LAURA: He gets to save?

2408
02:45:47,813 --> 02:45:52,463
MATT: Yes, he does. Which he makes. So he takes
half damage. So it's 6d10.

2409
02:45:52,463 --> 02:46:00,605
LAURA: Oh! Whoa. That's okay, I'll just roll this,
'cause this is easier.

2410
02:46:00,605 --> 02:46:12,087
LIAM: 6d10.

2411
02:46:12,087 --> 02:46:15,101
LAURA: Oh, that was just 6d10. 32 halved.

2412
02:46:15,101 --> 02:46:17,111
MATT: 32 halved. All right.

2413
02:46:17,111 --> 02:46:18,374
SAM: Worth it.

2414
02:46:18,374 --> 02:46:26,048
MATT: You release the first arrow, which goes and
strikes Thordak in the upper shoulder wing area.

2415
02:46:26,048 --> 02:46:31,911
(growls) He turns around and goes to face you, the
arms and wings open angrily. As you release the

2416
02:46:31,911 --> 02:46:36,692
dragon-slaying arrow, it goes and hits the side
where the chest is currently disintegrated and

2417
02:46:36,692 --> 02:46:40,656
exposed. As the arrow, using the power of Fenthras
behind it, slams into the crystal, the crystal

2418
02:46:40,656 --> 02:46:56,498
shatters. As it breaks, you watch as Thordak goes
(crazed laughter) and the form begins to slowly shrink.

2419
02:46:56,498 --> 02:46:59,002
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

2420
02:46:59,002 --> 02:47:07,273
MATT: (growling) He seems to be grinning and
laughing through the pain as the swollen,

2421
02:47:07,273 --> 02:47:15,268
primordial dragon form of Thordak begins to slowly
wither and wither.

2422
02:47:15,268 --> 02:47:17,407
SAM: You have another model?

2423
02:47:17,407 --> 02:47:19,092
LAURA: What?!

2424
02:47:19,092 --> 02:47:21,202
SAM: And it's even bigger.

2425
02:47:21,202 --> 02:47:25,656
LAURA: Look at the puny little fuck.

2426
02:47:25,656 --> 02:47:28,066
SAM: He's a little puny baby.

2427
02:47:28,066 --> 02:47:31,993
MATT: That's still a pretty fucking huge dragon.

2428
02:47:31,993 --> 02:47:36,821
(laughter)

2429
02:47:36,821 --> 02:47:38,741
SAM: He's so sad.

2430
02:47:38,741 --> 02:47:48,035
MATT: Now there are hanging folds of dragon hide
skin. The form shrunk, but portions still are

2431
02:47:48,035 --> 02:47:49,629
sagging off of it.

2432
02:47:49,629 --> 02:48:02,827
LAURA: Can I duck around the side so I'm in the
building? So I'm not in the opening. Yeah.

2433
02:48:02,827 --> 02:48:09,010
MARISHA: Are we going to try and take Raishan out
as well?

2434
02:48:09,010 --> 02:48:21,925
MATT: At the end of your turn, he's going to use
two legendary actions to wing attack. Trying to

2435
02:48:21,925 --> 02:48:34,513
whip the wings much faster now due to the somewhat
dire circumstances. I need Pike, and currently

2436
02:48:34,513 --> 02:48:38,986
just Pike, to make a dexterity saving throw.

2437
02:48:38,986 --> 02:48:42,524
SAM: Come on, Pike. For all the marbles.

2438
02:48:42,524 --> 02:48:44,317
LAURA: 17.

2439
02:48:44,317 --> 02:49:02,537
MATT: Nope. Pike takes 20 points of bludgeoning
damage and eight points of fire damage reduced to four.

2440
02:49:02,537 --> 02:49:07,041
LAURA: So she's got ten points left.

2441
02:49:07,041 --> 02:49:10,351
SAM: She's a perfect ten. Always was.

2442
02:49:10,351 --> 02:49:19,040
MATT: He's going to fly up--

2443
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,816
SAM: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?

2444
02:49:21,816 --> 02:49:23,032
TRAVIS: I do!

2445
02:49:23,032 --> 02:49:24,259
LAURA: And Pike does!

2446
02:49:24,259 --> 02:49:26,704
MATT: There we go. You both do.

2447
02:49:26,704 --> 02:49:33,874
TRAVIS: Has his AC changed with his different
size? You don't know? Reckless, Great Weapon

2448
02:49:33,874 --> 02:49:40,446
Master. Natural 20.

2449
02:49:40,446 --> 02:49:41,659
MATT: Really?

2450
02:49:41,659 --> 02:49:43,199
TRAVIS: Yeah, on the first roll.

2451
02:49:43,199 --> 02:49:47,285
LAURA: And Pike rolled a 32.

2452
02:49:47,285 --> 02:49:48,823
SAM: Jesus. What is she attacking with?

2453
02:49:48,823 --> 02:49:49,973
LAURA: Her Mace of Disruption.

2454
02:49:49,973 --> 02:49:51,080
SAM: Yes, she is.

2455
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:52,996
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage for both of
them.

2456
02:49:52,996 --> 02:49:58,921
TRAVIS: I also have brutal critical which at
thirteenth level, you roll two additional damage dice.

2457
02:49:58,921 --> 02:50:00,269
MATT: Yes, you do.

2458
02:50:00,269 --> 02:50:01,755
TALIESIN: Which you then double, don't you?

2459
02:50:01,755 --> 02:50:06,742
MATT: No. You add those two. So roll the damage
first, and then double the dice.

2460
02:50:06,742 --> 02:50:10,627
LAURA: And then she gets Divine Strike, right? On
her attack.

2461
02:50:10,627 --> 02:50:11,730
MATT: Correct.

2462
02:50:11,730 --> 02:50:14,662
TRAVIS: 28. So I double that?

2463
02:50:14,662 --> 02:50:22,846
MATT: You double the dice. Including the d4 and d6
from your weapon and your enlarged status.

2464
02:50:22,846 --> 02:50:40,235
TRAVIS: Right. So that's 16 doubled, 32. So then,
that's an 11. So 47.

2465
02:50:40,276 --> 02:50:41,945
MATT: Nice, and Pike's?

2466
02:50:41,945 --> 02:50:54,378
LAURA: Pike rolled-- fuck. 18. 19! It was 19.

2467
02:50:54,378 --> 02:51:03,794
MATT: Okay. Perfect. You both strike, as the
now-diminished form of Thordak begins to pull

2468
02:51:03,794 --> 02:51:08,965
backward, eyes looking around. The piercing
star-like white light of the eyes seems to have

2469
02:51:08,965 --> 02:51:16,256
slowly recoiled into a glowing reddish-orange. And
you can now see where the crystal once was in the

2470
02:51:16,256 --> 02:51:23,681
chest, there is just a gaping hole where bits
of flesh and dragon muscle are hanging out,

2471
02:51:23,681 --> 02:51:30,012
occasionally slopping out of the wound. He's
pulling back. All right.

2472
02:51:30,012 --> 02:51:31,256
LIAM: I'm up.

2473
02:51:31,256 --> 02:51:32,455
MATT: Yep.

2474
02:51:32,455 --> 02:51:38,128
LIAM: I'm going to arc up and land on his head.
I'm just going to unload all three: action,

2475
02:51:38,128 --> 02:51:39,853
action, bonus action, into his head.

2476
02:51:39,853 --> 02:51:41,121
MATT: Okay.

2477
02:51:41,121 --> 02:51:50,443
LIAM: First attack probably misses, that's 17?

2478
02:51:50,443 --> 02:51:51,841
MATT: Misses.

2479
02:51:51,841 --> 02:51:54,175
LIAM: Second attack hits. That's 24.

2480
02:51:54,175 --> 02:51:55,180
MATT: Hits.

2481
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:58,449
LIAM: Third attack with the dragon sword is a 22.

2482
02:51:58,449 --> 02:52:00,004
MATT: 22 hits.

2483
02:52:00,004 --> 02:52:49,442
LIAM: So, with Whisper. (counting) That's 45 with
Whisper. And then with the dragonslayer sword.

2484
02:52:49,442 --> 02:53:09,688
Eight plus six plus 3d6. So 21. What did I say
before that?

2485
02:53:09,688 --> 02:53:11,374
LAURA and TRAVIS: 45.

2486
02:53:11,374 --> 02:53:14,744
LIAM: So 21 plus 45 is-- So 66.

2487
02:53:14,744 --> 02:53:21,182
LAURA: It's 45 for the first attack, 21
for the second.

2488
02:53:21,182 --> 02:53:23,972
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

2489
02:53:23,972 --> 02:53:25,368
LIAM: And I will stay there.

2490
02:53:25,368 --> 02:53:30,272
MATT: You're going to stay there? All right. So
you are currently up here, in Thordak's face.

2491
02:53:30,272 --> 02:53:36,043
LAURA: This is going to be bad if 
we have to take Raishan out.

2492
02:53:36,043 --> 02:53:41,221
MATT: Cool, so that ends Vax's turn. Kima--

2493
02:53:41,221 --> 02:53:46,672
SAM: Oh yeah, the wyvern.

2494
02:53:46,672 --> 02:53:51,333
MATT: That wyvern just can't seem to keep itself
standing.

2495
02:53:51,333 --> 02:54:01,197
SAM: That was really good handwork, I didn't catch
any of it. That I got.

2496
02:54:01,197 --> 02:54:09,193
MATT: She's just going to move towards Raishan.
She's going to move over to this wall.

2497
02:54:09,245 --> 02:54:12,981
LIAM: Sorry. Also, four for Hunter's Mark on the
second attack as well.

2498
02:54:12,981 --> 02:54:25,293
MATT: Okay. That's ends Kima's turn, going over
there. Pike's turn. Pike is knocked prone from the spell earlier.

2499
02:54:25,293 --> 02:54:29,886
LAURA: She's still alive. She gets up.

2500
02:54:29,886 --> 02:54:32,290
LIAM: Girl.

2501
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:41,609
LAURA: (singing) She's going to Guiding Bolt up
the butt! At what level do we have left?

2502
02:54:41,609 --> 02:54:46,141
LIAM: So many levels. All the levels. Pike cheat
sheet. Five!

2503
02:54:46,141 --> 02:54:47,870
LAURA: She's going to cast it at a five.

2504
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:55,170
LIAM: Plus 1d6 every level above second level. So
3d6.

2505
02:54:55,170 --> 02:55:01,891
LAURA: 4d6. Plus 4d6. So 8d6. She has to roll the
attack first, or just straight-up?

2506
02:55:01,891 --> 02:55:06,224
MATT: Well, she has to roll to attack with her
spell bonus, her spell attack bonus.

2507
02:55:06,224 --> 02:55:09,096
LAURA: 24.

2508
02:55:09,096 --> 02:55:10,528
MATT: 24 hits.

2509
02:55:10,528 --> 02:55:14,488
LAURA: All right. So 8d6.

2510
02:55:14,488 --> 02:55:22,533
LIAM: You can do it, Pike. All the way from New
York City.

2511
02:55:22,533 --> 02:55:35,600
LAURA: Five. Seven. Eight. Ten. 16. 18. Another
two. 26.

2512
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:40,660
MATT: 26? Nice. As the guiding bolt slams into the
side of Thordak's side, you can see this

2513
02:55:40,660 --> 02:55:44,567
glimmering beacon of light. The next attack
against Thordak has advantage.

2514
02:55:44,567 --> 02:55:55,360
LAURA: Oh good. And then she's going to Healing
Word again? Yeah, she's pretty fucked, so she'll

2515
02:55:55,360 --> 02:55:59,164
Healing Word at second level, that's her last
2nd-level...

2516
02:55:59,164 --> 02:56:03,597
MATT: So 2d4 plus five. To herself?

2517
02:56:03,597 --> 02:56:09,636
LAURA: And that's just to one person? Yeah, so
she'll... so she's going to do that to Jarett.

2518
02:56:09,636 --> 02:56:11,226
MATT: Okay.

2519
02:56:11,226 --> 02:56:13,457
SAM: She would heal Jarett over herself?

2520
02:56:13,457 --> 02:56:18,374
LAURA: It's Pike. I'm being honest, she would heal
Jarett.

2521
02:56:18,374 --> 02:56:20,612
TRAVIS: I don't know why we're wasting that on
Jarett.

2522
02:56:20,612 --> 02:56:25,032
MATT: Jarett went and got you illicit drugs,
Scanlan!

2523
02:56:25,032 --> 02:56:30,765
TRAVIS: I mean, he had a great accent, but fuck.
You remember the cryptkeeper? Jarett's going to

2524
02:56:30,765 --> 02:56:32,877
those auditions tomorrow.

2525
02:56:32,877 --> 02:56:34,829
LAURA: So that's eight.

2526
02:56:34,829 --> 02:56:38,652
MATT: Eight? Okay, so Jarett is healed up eight
points.

2527
02:56:38,652 --> 02:56:41,607
LIAM: He is Groot.

2528
02:56:41,607 --> 02:56:43,018
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2529
02:56:43,018 --> 02:56:48,366
MATT: Where the terrible burns are, most of them
seem to heal, or at least scar to a point where he

2530
02:56:48,366 --> 02:56:51,789
comes to consciousness. He's like, "What
happened?"

2531
02:56:51,789 --> 02:56:55,771
LAURA: "Jarett, you need to get up and fight."

2532
02:56:55,771 --> 02:57:08,429
MATT: "Right." Grabs the crossbow to the side,
leans up. So was that Pike's turn?

2533
02:57:08,429 --> 02:57:09,642
LAURA: Yeah.

2534
02:57:09,642 --> 02:57:11,982
MATT: All right, was that Pike's turn? Scanlan,
you're up.

2535
02:57:11,982 --> 02:57:14,600
TALIESIN: Like slap the charred skin off his face.
Get back in there!

2536
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:17,302
LIAM: The whole face comes off.

2537
02:57:17,302 --> 02:57:32,004
SAM: Shit. I will use my action to pour my
superior healing potion into Pike's mouth.

2538
02:57:32,004 --> 02:57:34,438
LIAM: That's love.

2539
02:57:34,438 --> 02:57:37,735
LAURA: "Scanlan, I can do that myself."

2540
02:57:37,735 --> 02:57:46,342
SAM: Oh wait. First, I aerate it.

2541
02:57:46,342 --> 02:57:51,239
(laughter)

2542
02:57:51,239 --> 02:57:57,335
LAURA: So that's 8d4?

2543
02:57:57,335 --> 02:57:59,722
SAM: I don't know. What is it?

2544
02:57:59,722 --> 02:58:03,185
LAURA: That is 8d4. Do you do that or do I?

2545
02:58:03,185 --> 02:58:04,761
SAM: Do I roll it, or does she?

2546
02:58:04,761 --> 02:58:07,649
MATT: You roll it, that's fine.

2547
02:58:07,649 --> 02:58:26,447
SAM: It's just a bunch of d4s? 8d4s? Oh my god.
This is so many. Six. 13. 16. 20, plus something.

2548
02:58:26,447 --> 02:58:27,892
Plus six, 26.

2549
02:58:27,973 --> 02:58:29,475
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

2550
02:58:29,475 --> 02:58:36,327
SAM: Who else can I see? Nobody. Jarett's alive,
right?

2551
02:58:36,327 --> 02:58:40,400
MATT: Correct.

2552
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:43,914
SAM: Now as my bonus action...

2553
02:58:43,914 --> 02:58:46,334
TRAVIS: Whether he wants to be when he sees a
mirror...

2554
02:58:46,334 --> 02:58:50,479
SAM: Well shit, I have an action, I can do
anything. I can do anything!

2555
02:58:50,479 --> 02:58:55,539
TRAVIS: Yeah, you could play the fucking flute.

2556
02:58:55,539 --> 02:58:57,993
SAM: What? What flute?

2557
02:58:57,993 --> 02:58:59,911
LIAM: What are you saving it for?

2558
02:58:59,911 --> 02:59:02,859
SAM: I play a shawm.

2559
02:59:02,859 --> 02:59:06,206
LAURA: We're going to have to fight Raishan in a
second.

2560
02:59:06,206 --> 02:59:08,592
MARISHA: This is far from over.

2561
02:59:08,592 --> 02:59:12,780
TALIESIN: And whatever's in that pit. And
whatever's in that pit.

2562
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:14,654
SAM: What? How's she doing? Is she okay?

2563
02:59:14,654 --> 02:59:15,945
LAURA: She's at 36.

2564
02:59:15,945 --> 02:59:23,923
SAM: It's not great. All right, I will attack the
dragon. Bigby's Hand at level six. Why not?

2565
02:59:23,923 --> 02:59:25,365
MATT: So you recast Bigby's Hand?

2566
02:59:25,365 --> 02:59:26,700
MATT: All righty.

2567
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:28,882
LIAM: Give the people what they want.

2568
02:59:28,882 --> 02:59:31,723
SAM: That is <i>not</i> what they want.

2569
02:59:31,723 --> 02:59:34,044
LAURA: Hey, he's got a hole in the middle of his
chest.

2570
02:59:34,044 --> 02:59:36,405
SAM: I'll poke it.

2571
02:59:36,405 --> 02:59:38,092
MATT: Go ahead and roll a spell attack.

2572
02:59:38,092 --> 02:59:44,042
SAM: Nope. Did Pike help me out?

2573
02:59:44,042 --> 02:59:49,710
LAURA: Yes! She casts her last War God's Blessing.
Add a ten to that.

2574
02:59:49,710 --> 02:59:51,243
MATT: So plus ten to that.

2575
02:59:51,243 --> 02:59:52,237
SAM: 23.

2576
02:59:52,237 --> 02:59:55,405
MATT: 23 hits. So that would be?

2577
02:59:55,405 --> 02:59:58,361
SAM: 6d8. Gimme.

2578
02:59:58,361 --> 03:00:01,481
LIAM: Here comes the gnome.

2579
03:00:01,481 --> 03:00:05,787
TALIESIN: Here's 4d8. 5d8. 6d8.

2580
03:00:05,787 --> 03:00:12,354
SAM: 27.

2581
03:00:12,354 --> 03:00:14,374
MATT: 27? Nice.

2582
03:00:14,374 --> 03:00:17,649
LAURA: Every time!

2583
03:00:17,649 --> 03:00:21,444
MATT: All right. Percival. Unless you want to
move, Scanlan.

2584
03:00:21,444 --> 03:00:30,288
SAM: I moved to Pike to pour stuff in her. That's
all. I did not mean that in any weird way.

2585
03:00:30,288 --> 03:00:31,902
MATT: Percival. Your turn.

2586
03:00:31,902 --> 03:00:38,320
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to, for my bonus action,
I'm going to down a greater, which is 4d4, I

2587
03:00:38,320 --> 03:00:39,477
believe?

2588
03:00:39,477 --> 03:00:42,771
MATT: 4d4 plus four, yeah.

2589
03:00:42,771 --> 03:00:51,183
LAURA: Did you add four to your 26 when you healed
her? Or did you just roll--

2590
03:00:51,183 --> 03:01:01,002
TALIESIN: I'm dying less. I'm going to stand up.
I'm technically engaged with this bloody thing,

2591
03:01:01,002 --> 03:01:02,100
aren't I?

2592
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,193
MATT: Correct.

2593
03:01:03,193 --> 03:01:08,402
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm just going to-- There's little
I can do other than just say, please, somebody fix

2594
03:01:08,402 --> 03:01:20,434
this, and I'm going to take two shots at the red
dragon. First shot with Bad News. 23?

2595
03:01:20,434 --> 03:01:21,948
MATT: 23 hits.

2596
03:01:21,948 --> 03:01:30,156
TALIESIN: I'm going to just throw-- forget it,
I'll throw four charges of Cabal's Ruin there.

2597
03:01:30,156 --> 03:01:32,097
Let's just do it.

2598
03:01:32,097 --> 03:01:34,367
MATT: That's an additional 4d6 damage.

2599
03:01:34,367 --> 03:01:36,155
LIAM: Am I electrified, sitting on his head?

2600
03:01:36,155 --> 03:01:42,741
TALIESIN: Technically speaking, no, the way that
this works-- it's like a Tesla arc, so it wouldn't

2601
03:01:42,741 --> 03:01:45,521
technically-- you'll feel tingly.

2602
03:01:45,521 --> 03:01:49,391
MATT: Your hair sticks up a little bit. Your
nipples get a little pointy.

2603
03:01:49,391 --> 03:01:51,158
(laughter)

2604
03:01:51,158 --> 03:01:53,427
MATT: Start shaking in the leather armor.

2605
03:01:53,427 --> 03:01:55,041
LIAM: Do it again, Percy.

2606
03:01:55,041 --> 03:01:57,009
(laughter)

2607
03:01:57,009 --> 03:02:06,446
TALIESIN: Bloody fanart. Okay. And let's see what
kind of damage we do with this. Eh. That sucks.

2608
03:02:06,446 --> 03:02:19,317
Stop it! Stop it! I can't count when-- that's
(counting) 21 points of damage. Stop saying that,

2609
03:02:19,317 --> 03:02:21,842
it's 21! You don't know, it's 21.

2610
03:02:21,842 --> 03:02:23,507
MATT: Okay.

2611
03:02:23,507 --> 03:02:36,637
TALIESIN: Second shot. Can I reroll that, 'cause
he? Yeah, it misses. And now I'm going to die.

2612
03:02:36,637 --> 03:02:41,805
You're like everything I hate about Overwatch.

2613
03:02:41,805 --> 03:02:43,919
SAM: You're not going to die.

2614
03:02:43,919 --> 03:02:50,765
MATT: One of the fingered claws of Thordak gets
blasted off from the impact from Bad News, the

2615
03:02:50,765 --> 03:02:58,454
energy arcing through the rest of his arm from
Cabal's Ruin. The second shot, however, having to aim,

2616
03:02:58,454 --> 03:03:04,206
manages to just barely miss Vax. He gets in the
way of the shot, and you have to shoot wide and it

2617
03:03:04,206 --> 03:03:07,699
misses entirely. Is that your turn?

2618
03:03:07,699 --> 03:03:11,805
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's my turn.

2619
03:03:11,805 --> 03:03:23,221
MATT: At the end of Percy's turn, Thordak's going
to go ahead and use his third legendary action.

2620
03:03:23,221 --> 03:03:25,156
SAM: To do what?

2621
03:03:25,156 --> 03:03:34,010
MATT: To do a tail attack against Vax. That is a
22 to hit?

2622
03:03:34,010 --> 03:03:40,015
LIAM: No. Nope. Nope. Hasted, 23, fuck you. Not
you.

2623
03:03:40,015 --> 03:03:46,047
SAM: 23? Jesus! Where'd you go?

2624
03:03:46,047 --> 03:04:00,206
MATT: All right. So that brings us to-- we're
going to say this will be... all right. The

2625
03:04:00,206 --> 03:04:03,587
ground shakes.

2626
03:04:03,587 --> 03:04:06,864
SAM: Oh, shit, I forgot about that. Lair actions.

2627
03:04:06,864 --> 03:04:11,670
MATT: A 60-foot radius around the dragon, as just
the presence of Thordak, the ground just begins

2628
03:04:11,670 --> 03:04:17,176
quaking beneath. You watch as fissures of small
volcanic energy begin to break from underneath.

2629
03:04:17,176 --> 03:04:19,774
Pretty much everybody--

2630
03:04:19,774 --> 03:04:21,236
SAM: Is Jarett in there?

2631
03:04:21,236 --> 03:04:25,719
MATT: Yep. Except for you, who's in the air. Need
to make a dexterity saving throw.

2632
03:04:25,719 --> 03:04:29,992
TALIESIN: Nope, rerolling that.

2633
03:04:29,992 --> 03:04:33,063
SAM: Natural 20, 25.

2634
03:04:33,063 --> 03:04:40,672
TALIESIN: I'm rerolling, because that was awful. Oh,
never mind.

2635
03:04:40,672 --> 03:04:43,019
SAM: Yeah, if he doesn't like it, he gets to
reroll.

2636
03:04:43,019 --> 03:04:44,758
MATT: It's a fighter ability.

2637
03:04:44,758 --> 03:04:46,799
TALIESIN: Nine.

2638
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:50,466
LAURA: 30 for me.

2639
03:04:50,466 --> 03:04:51,882
MATT: Pike?

2640
03:04:51,882 --> 03:04:55,776
LAURA: Eight for Pike.

2641
03:04:55,776 --> 03:04:57,084
TRAVIS: 11.

2642
03:04:57,084 --> 03:04:59,029
LIAM: Not like this.

2643
03:04:59,029 --> 03:05:11,248
MATT: Grog, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Gilmore, all get
knocked prone from the ground quaking as you all

2644
03:05:11,248 --> 03:05:16,502
fall on your back. You manage to brace yourself
against the wall real fast, Vex.

2645
03:05:16,502 --> 03:05:18,527
SAM: Does Jarett get knocked to his feet?

2646
03:05:18,527 --> 03:05:22,043
MATT: (laughs) No. He just gets shaken on the
ground.

2647
03:05:22,043 --> 03:05:25,469
MARISHA: Popcorn on a trampoline.

2648
03:05:25,469 --> 03:05:35,937
MATT: Raishan does not get her breath back. She
is, however, going to utilize Chain Lightning.

2649
03:05:35,937 --> 03:05:38,689
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to see how this works.

2650
03:05:38,689 --> 03:05:43,846
LAURA: She's going to hit us. No, she decides
where it hits.

2651
03:05:43,846 --> 03:05:46,375
SAM: She's still on our side, right?

2652
03:05:46,375 --> 03:05:48,079
TALIESIN: For another round or two.

2653
03:05:48,079 --> 03:06:08,944
MATT: All right. Chain Lightning. Dexterity saving
throw. That's a success for Thordak. Sorry, I'm

2654
03:06:08,944 --> 03:06:21,319
trying to get through this. Okay, so that is
halved. Halved, that is 18 points of lightning

2655
03:06:21,319 --> 03:06:25,404
damage. Vax, make a dexterity saving throw.

2656
03:06:25,404 --> 03:06:34,999
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. Yeah. Good time to
use Luck. 26.

2657
03:06:34,999 --> 03:06:42,410
MATT: 26, okay. You suffer 18 points of lightning
damage as the bolt of energy that strikes Thordak

2658
03:06:42,410 --> 03:06:44,661
then arcs into you because you're right next to
it.

2659
03:06:44,661 --> 03:06:49,192
LIAM: Would this be a new round for me to use
Evasion? I've lost track.

2660
03:06:49,192 --> 03:06:54,100
LAURA: No, 'cause Thordak's already gone.

2661
03:06:54,100 --> 03:07:07,287
MATT: No, you've already used it. So yeah. That
ends that. Going to take off and land right there

2662
03:07:07,287 --> 03:07:09,125
next to that guy.

2663
03:07:09,125 --> 03:07:11,481
LAURA: Who is that guy?

2664
03:07:11,481 --> 03:07:16,697
MATT: That's the lizardman that fell from the
wyvern. Keyleth, you're up.

2665
03:07:16,697 --> 03:07:20,201
LAURA: Dragon just landed on him, basically.

2666
03:07:20,201 --> 03:07:21,881
SAM: I think he's got a shot.

2667
03:07:21,881 --> 03:07:23,390
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

2668
03:07:23,390 --> 03:07:31,735
MARISHA: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to stand up.
Question. Is Thordak within 30 feet of fire giant dude?

2669
03:07:31,735 --> 03:07:33,249
MATT: No.

2670
03:07:33,249 --> 03:07:43,532
MARISHA: Okay. That answers my question, then. I'm going
to reach up and do Blight on Thordak, 'cause I

2671
03:07:43,532 --> 03:07:45,057
think I can, this time.

2672
03:07:45,057 --> 03:07:46,766
MATT: What's the range on Blight?

2673
03:07:46,766 --> 03:07:49,094
MARISHA: 30 feet.

2674
03:07:49,094 --> 03:07:51,370
MATT: Nope. Thordak is 50 feet in the air.

2675
03:07:51,370 --> 03:07:58,061
MARISHA: Fucking shit fuck balls. Okay. Then--

2676
03:07:58,061 --> 03:08:01,311
LAURA: Maybe you can jump and then cast it.

2677
03:08:01,311 --> 03:08:03,302
MATT: You could climb up and cast it, if you
wanted to try that.

2678
03:08:03,302 --> 03:08:09,396
MARISHA: No. I'm in a skirt situation. It's not
good.

2679
03:08:09,396 --> 03:08:12,239
SAM: I'm not even paying attention, so if that's
your concern.

2680
03:08:12,239 --> 03:08:23,882
MARISHA: No, it's just clumsy. Okay, I'm going to
do-- everything's not ideal right now!

2681
03:08:23,882 --> 03:08:27,913
LAURA: Climb it, climb it, Keyleth! Just do it!

2682
03:08:27,913 --> 03:08:29,683
LIAM: It's fucking end of the world!

2683
03:08:29,683 --> 03:08:31,111
TALIESIN: They don't know.

2684
03:08:31,111 --> 03:08:38,796
MARISHA: You don't know! I'm not good at that. I'm
bad at that thing. So I'm not a dextrous person,

2685
03:08:38,796 --> 03:08:44,303
so instead I'm going to use my Spire of Conflux.

2686
03:08:44,303 --> 03:08:46,478
SAM: Oh yeah, that Vestige thing!

2687
03:08:46,478 --> 03:08:49,344
MARISHA: Look, I haven't forgotten about it, all
right?

2688
03:08:49,344 --> 03:08:55,220
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to right now?

2689
03:08:55,220 --> 03:08:59,839
MARISHA: My ancestors. And I'm going to do Chain
Lightning on Thordak.

2690
03:08:59,839 --> 03:09:01,502
SAM: Oh! Another chain.

2691
03:09:01,502 --> 03:09:09,281
MATT: All righty. Thordak's save is 19.

2692
03:09:09,281 --> 03:09:12,032
MARISHA: Fail, motherfucker!

2693
03:09:12,032 --> 03:09:17,594
MATT: Thordak's going to use his second legendary
resistance to make it. So go ahead and roll

2694
03:09:17,594 --> 03:09:18,786
damage.

2695
03:09:18,786 --> 03:09:23,181
MARISHA: Fine, that's fine. It's how many damage?
Like 8d10?

2696
03:09:23,181 --> 03:09:24,519
MATT: 8d10.

2697
03:09:24,519 --> 03:09:26,024
TALIESIN: Want some d10s?

2698
03:09:26,024 --> 03:09:27,681
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.

2699
03:09:27,681 --> 03:09:32,973
TALIESIN: Here's three more. How many are you at?

2700
03:09:32,973 --> 03:09:42,332
MARISHA: I need one more. Oh, and I get to reroll
ones, right? That's actually really--

2701
03:09:42,332 --> 03:09:46,176
TALIESIN: Whoa! Holy fuck.

2702
03:09:46,176 --> 03:09:48,858
SAM: Is that a one?

2703
03:09:48,858 --> 03:10:08,589
MARISHA: No, that's a seven. So that's 29, 34,
plus-- that's a seven. And then 34 plus 14 is 48.

2704
03:10:08,589 --> 03:10:11,939
MATT: So half that is 24 points of lightning
damage.

2705
03:10:11,939 --> 03:10:16,326
MARISHA: And there's no one else within 30 feet of
him, other than Raishan?

2706
03:10:16,326 --> 03:10:19,306
MATT: Raishan's not even in that range.

2707
03:10:19,306 --> 03:10:29,307
MARISHA: No one else? Well. Okay. I do that, and
then I turn around and I'm going to cast a

2708
03:10:29,307 --> 03:10:31,166
Grasping Vine as a bonus action.

2709
03:10:31,166 --> 03:10:32,428
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

2710
03:10:32,428 --> 03:10:38,586
MARISHA: Right next to me. And then I'm going to
use it to whip around and grab Percy and--

2711
03:10:38,586 --> 03:10:41,175
MATT: You do not have visual range on Percy right
now.

2712
03:10:41,175 --> 03:10:46,270
MARISHA: I haven't used any movement. Can I shift
into that house a little bit?

2713
03:10:46,270 --> 03:10:47,604
MATT: Sure, you move into the house?

2714
03:10:47,604 --> 03:10:51,681
MARISHA: Uh-huh. And once again cast Grasping Vine
from out of that corner and drag Percy to me.

2715
03:10:51,681 --> 03:10:52,730
MATT: Okay.

2716
03:10:52,730 --> 03:10:55,096
MARISHA: Around the ankles.

2717
03:10:55,096 --> 03:10:57,925
MATT: Still prone, but better.

2718
03:10:57,925 --> 03:10:59,763
MARISHA: Hi.

2719
03:10:59,763 --> 03:11:03,112
TALIESIN: Hi. That was really good. Ow.

2720
03:11:03,112 --> 03:11:11,326
MATT: That end your turn? All right. Jarett's
turn. Jarett gets up. Jarett still only has a view

2721
03:11:11,326 --> 03:11:21,539
of the dragon and is like, "What happened to--
that's weird." Missed the whole exchange. But gets

2722
03:11:21,539 --> 03:11:30,700
the gist of it. Disadvantage. Misses. Natural 20,
disadvantage. 15, still hits. Not a critical,

2723
03:11:30,700 --> 03:11:34,232
unfortunately. But a ten on damage, that's 13
piercing damage.

2724
03:11:34,232 --> 03:11:37,043
LAURA: It didn't drop fear when he died?

2725
03:11:37,043 --> 03:11:40,167
MATT: No, I think that would instill more fear.

2726
03:11:40,167 --> 03:11:41,120
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

2727
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:43,289
(laughter)

2728
03:11:43,289 --> 03:11:44,671
LAURA: Just checking.

2729
03:11:44,671 --> 03:11:46,075
MATT: Logistically.

2730
03:11:46,075 --> 03:11:48,163
LAURA: I didn't know if it was a reset when you
wake up.

2731
03:11:48,163 --> 03:11:52,230
MATT: Right. Gilmore gets up from the ground.

2732
03:11:52,230 --> 03:12:01,727
TALIESIN: I'm so distracted right now. There's too
much happening.

2733
03:12:01,727 --> 03:12:18,359
MATT: So he's going to cast another 4th-level
Lightning Bolt. Thordak fails his save. Is going

2734
03:12:18,359 --> 03:12:23,291
to use his last resistance to get that, 'cause
he's doing real rough.

2735
03:12:23,291 --> 03:12:28,372
LAURA: You've got big-level spells, don't you,
still?

2736
03:12:28,372 --> 03:12:30,082
SAM: Yeah, one.

2737
03:12:30,082 --> 03:12:47,519
MATT: He's rolling shit tonight. 14 points of
lightning damage. No, 16. Okay. All righty. That's

2738
03:12:47,519 --> 03:12:50,846
Gilmore's turn. It's Grog and Thordak's turn.

2739
03:12:50,846 --> 03:12:53,137
TRAVIS: Oh, yes? I would like to stand up.

2740
03:12:53,137 --> 03:12:54,601
MATT: Okay.

2741
03:12:54,601 --> 03:12:57,838
TRAVIS: How high is Thordak?

2742
03:12:57,838 --> 03:13:00,123
MATT: Thordak is 40 feet up.

2743
03:13:00,123 --> 03:13:05,460
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch on a stick. Could I just
attach the bloodaxe and throw it at his much

2744
03:13:05,460 --> 03:13:07,238
smaller foot, now?

2745
03:13:07,238 --> 03:13:08,569
MATT: Sure.

2746
03:13:08,569 --> 03:13:11,643
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can only jump 20 feet in the
air. 15 feet in the air.

2747
03:13:11,643 --> 03:13:13,312
LIAM: That'll do it, won't it?

2748
03:13:13,312 --> 03:13:14,970
TRAVIS: He's 40 feet in the air.

2749
03:13:14,970 --> 03:13:19,227
SAM: You don't know numbers. Maybe it'll work.

2750
03:13:19,227 --> 03:13:25,122
TRAVIS: These hieroglyphs seem to indicate that
he's too high. Yeah, 'cause I'm only like 14 feet

2751
03:13:25,122 --> 03:13:26,479
high, right?

2752
03:13:26,479 --> 03:13:28,379
MATT: Right now? Yeah.

2753
03:13:28,379 --> 03:13:38,443
TRAVIS: I'm reckless throwing the bushwhacker.

2754
03:13:38,443 --> 03:13:42,168
LAURA: (gasps) He got another natural 20!

2755
03:13:42,168 --> 03:13:43,360
SAM: Holy shit!

2756
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:45,251
MATT: You have advantage. Roll again.

2757
03:13:45,251 --> 03:13:46,310
TRAVIS: Ten.

2758
03:13:46,310 --> 03:13:51,696
LAURA: That's a really pretty die that he's got,
too. Sparkly.

2759
03:13:51,696 --> 03:13:54,128
MARISHA: She's getting ideas.

2760
03:13:54,128 --> 03:14:12,943
TRAVIS: (counting) 34, 37, 38. 38 points of
damage.

2761
03:14:12,943 --> 03:14:18,096
MATT: 38 points of damage.

2762
03:14:18,096 --> 03:14:22,845
TALIESIN: That with your bonus? I just said that
randomly, I don't actually know any of your

2763
03:14:22,845 --> 03:14:25,005
bonuses, I just thought maybe it would jog
something.

2764
03:14:25,005 --> 03:14:32,174
TRAVIS: With my movement, can I run nuts towards
where the fire giant is?

2765
03:14:32,174 --> 03:14:38,379
MATT: Sure. You can get right there.

2766
03:14:38,379 --> 03:14:42,224
TRAVIS: That'll work. I need a new plaything
that'll actually stay.

2767
03:14:42,224 --> 03:14:50,022
MATT: Thordak, who is physically falling apart at
this point, sections just sloughing off, and just

2768
03:14:50,022 --> 03:14:59,585
the whole experience has been sending his
physical-- his whole physical form is wrecked

2769
03:14:59,585 --> 03:15:05,637
right now. The word escapes me that I was looking
for. He's going to go ahead and turn and go into a

2770
03:15:05,637 --> 03:15:07,023
full flight.

2771
03:15:07,023 --> 03:15:08,684
LIAM: I'm riding him.

2772
03:15:08,684 --> 03:15:09,827
MATT: You're riding him?

2773
03:15:09,827 --> 03:15:11,640
LIAM: Yeah. Shit yeah, I'm riding him.

2774
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:14,378
MARISHA: Oh, no. No, Vax, no.

2775
03:15:14,378 --> 03:15:15,900
TALIESIN: Vax is good.

2776
03:15:15,900 --> 03:15:18,229
LAURA: No!

2777
03:15:18,229 --> 03:15:21,202
MATT: Dash into the dark hole within.

2778
03:15:21,202 --> 03:15:22,541
TALIESIN: This is good.

2779
03:15:22,541 --> 03:15:24,150
LAURA: Why is this good?

2780
03:15:24,150 --> 03:15:25,542
SAM: A dark hole?

2781
03:15:25,542 --> 03:15:29,171
LAURA: Vax, be careful!

2782
03:15:29,171 --> 03:15:31,169
TRAVIS: We don't care about the tunnel, huh?

2783
03:15:31,169 --> 03:15:33,283
(laughter)

2784
03:15:33,283 --> 03:15:39,367
MATT: You need to go ahead and roll a strength
saving throw to try and maintain grip as the

2785
03:15:39,367 --> 03:15:41,756
dragon goes into a full dive.

2786
03:15:41,756 --> 03:15:47,828
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck. So it's a 15.

2787
03:15:47,828 --> 03:15:56,436
MATT: 15. You do manage to make it inside the
tunnel, but you lose your grip and then go into a

2788
03:15:56,436 --> 03:16:03,247
full tumble, hitting the ground. It's a decline,
it's a 45-degree angle downward.

2789
03:16:03,247 --> 03:16:04,792
LIAM: So I'm in there with him.

2790
03:16:04,792 --> 03:16:08,732
MATT: Yes. Roll an acrobatics check to stop
yourself.

2791
03:16:08,732 --> 03:16:10,436
LIAM: That is a 25.

2792
03:16:10,436 --> 03:16:14,518
MATT: 25, okay. So you do tumble and come to a
stop. You don't take any damage from the fall, and

2793
03:16:14,518 --> 03:16:19,970
you stop yourself from doing a tumble, but it is
still a decline into darkness below, and you just

2794
03:16:19,970 --> 03:16:25,517
watch as the back end of Thordak's barely flying
form slams into the side of the tunnel and

2795
03:16:25,517 --> 03:16:27,357
continues swooping away.

2796
03:16:27,357 --> 03:16:29,377
LIAM: Do I still see him with darkvision at this
point?

2797
03:16:29,377 --> 03:16:32,590
MATT: He just begins to leave outside of your
darkvision.

2798
03:16:32,590 --> 03:16:37,202
LIAM: Are we still in the same chain of
initiative?

2799
03:16:37,202 --> 03:16:48,556
MATT: As of right now, we are, yes. So. Finishing,
that is Thordak's go. Vex, you're up.

2800
03:16:48,556 --> 03:17:01,240
LAURA: Okay. I run after him and dive after him,
because I saw that. And at the edge of my

2801
03:17:01,240 --> 03:17:08,732
movement, I want to hop out on my broom and get
ready to fly down the hole after.

2802
03:17:08,732 --> 03:17:13,782
MATT: Okay. So you are hasted, so you get down and
you basically have just enough movement to catch

2803
03:17:13,782 --> 03:17:19,035
up to your brother. And you get the broom out.
You're both down there in the darkness by

2804
03:17:19,035 --> 03:17:23,477
yourselves. You guys watch as the rest of them
dive into the hole. Vax, you're up.

2805
03:17:23,477 --> 03:17:25,677
LIAM: How far away from me is he?

2806
03:17:25,677 --> 03:17:27,360
MATT: How far does your darkvision go for?

2807
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:28,576
LIAM: 60 feet.

2808
03:17:28,576 --> 03:17:29,880
MATT: He's outside of your darkvision.

2809
03:17:29,880 --> 03:17:34,128
LIAM: Then I am going to use my movement and go
120 feet, or until I see him.

2810
03:17:34,128 --> 03:17:38,191
LAURA: Can I cast-- 'cause I didn't do an attack,
right?

2811
03:17:38,191 --> 03:17:43,468
MATT: This is happening after your turn. So you
begin to dart forward?

2812
03:17:43,468 --> 03:17:46,427
LIAM: This is just my movement. 120 feet or until
I'm on him.

2813
03:17:46,427 --> 03:17:50,263
MATT: Well, your movement is not 120 feet. You're
still flying through there?

2814
03:17:50,263 --> 03:17:51,708
LIAM: Yes, I'm flying.

2815
03:17:51,708 --> 03:17:56,791
MATT: Right, so your wings are still out there.
Okay. Okay. So yeah, you begin to come in, you see

2816
03:17:56,791 --> 03:17:59,264
him just begin to come into your visual range.

2817
03:17:59,264 --> 03:18:00,992
LIAM: Still away from me?

2818
03:18:00,992 --> 03:18:02,068
MATT: Still away from you.

2819
03:18:02,068 --> 03:18:05,066
LIAM: Then I'm going to use a bonus action to dash
and hit his back, and land on his back.

2820
03:18:05,066 --> 03:18:07,755
MATT: Okay. You land on his back.

2821
03:18:07,755 --> 03:18:16,638
LIAM: Attack, attack. First attack is a--
scheisse. 24.

2822
03:18:16,638 --> 03:18:21,863
MATT: I would say you have disadvantage on these
strikes, as you're currently gripping onto a

2823
03:18:21,863 --> 03:18:25,831
flying dragon underneath a cavern ripping through.
You have advantage on them automatically, which

2824
03:18:25,831 --> 03:18:29,421
means you don't have disadvantage on these
strikes, but you do not get the automatic sneak

2825
03:18:29,421 --> 03:18:30,809
attack.

2826
03:18:30,809 --> 03:18:32,651
LIAM: I don't remember-- oh, I don't get the
automatic sneak attack?

2827
03:18:32,651 --> 03:18:33,538
MATT: No.

2828
03:18:33,538 --> 03:18:34,613
LIAM: But I got advantage?

2829
03:18:34,613 --> 03:18:38,623
MATT: No. Essentially, you would have advantage,
and then trying to grip onto him and through the

2830
03:18:38,623 --> 03:18:41,087
middle of this tunnel and slamming into him, you
would have disadvantage, and so they both cancel

2831
03:18:41,087 --> 03:18:42,522
to just a regular attack.

2832
03:18:42,522 --> 03:18:43,836
LIAM: All right, so 24 for the first.

2833
03:18:43,836 --> 03:18:44,859
MATT: What was the first one?

2834
03:18:44,859 --> 03:18:45,686
LIAM: 24.

2835
03:18:45,686 --> 03:18:46,604
MATT: 24 hits.

2836
03:18:46,604 --> 03:18:47,843
LIAM: Second one is a natural 20.

2837
03:18:47,843 --> 03:18:49,977
MATT: Second one was a natural 20? All right.

2838
03:18:49,977 --> 03:19:10,230
LIAM: So the first one's the dragon-slaying.
Three, eight, 14, 19, plus Hunter's Mark. So

2839
03:19:10,230 --> 03:19:11,865
there's no sneak attack on this, right, you said?

2840
03:19:11,865 --> 03:19:13,335
MATT: Correct.

2841
03:19:13,335 --> 03:19:16,428
LIAM: 21 with the dragon-slayer.

2842
03:19:16,428 --> 03:19:18,154
MATT: 21, nice.

2843
03:19:18,154 --> 03:19:35,961
LIAM: And then Whisper, which is a natural 20, is
one plus that is nine, plus the-- six is 15, plus

2844
03:19:35,961 --> 03:19:39,538
Hunter's Mark. 17.

2845
03:19:39,538 --> 03:19:41,083
LAURA: Times two?

2846
03:19:41,083 --> 03:19:42,985
LIAM: Oh. 15 times two is 30.

2847
03:19:42,985 --> 03:19:46,592
LAURA: It's all times two, 'cause that's all--
well, 15 times two is 30.

2848
03:19:46,592 --> 03:19:50,981
LIAM: 30 plus eight. 38.

2849
03:19:50,981 --> 03:19:51,790
MATT: Okay.

2850
03:19:51,790 --> 03:19:52,984
How do you want to do this?

2851
03:19:52,984 --> 03:19:54,578
(yelling)

2852
03:19:54,578 --> 03:19:55,695
LAURA: In the dark. Alone.

2853
03:19:55,695 --> 03:19:57,105
SAM: In a dark pit.

2854
03:19:57,105 --> 03:20:05,981
LIAM: With Whisper, I'm going to shove it in so
that my hand disappears from view, so I'm up to my

2855
03:20:05,981 --> 03:20:12,691
forearm, and stab as far in as I can reach.

2856
03:20:12,691 --> 03:20:21,301
I hear the voice of my mother in the morning. Fuck
you.

2857
03:20:21,301 --> 03:20:29,918
MATT: As the blade plunges into Thordak's
now-sloughing and soft flesh, exposed through a

2858
03:20:29,918 --> 03:20:33,964
series of wounds and gashes left behind by your
allies, and his form just slowly shriveling into

2859
03:20:33,964 --> 03:20:42,344
its diminutive space, the dagger cuts cleanly
through, and with that force you go all the way up

2860
03:20:42,344 --> 03:20:51,031
to the shoulder as you reach inside. As you finish
saying your phrase, your eyes narrow and you

2861
03:20:51,031 --> 03:20:59,979
clench your teeth, and as you pull back and yank,
there's this strange series of low whispers that

2862
03:20:59,979 --> 03:21:08,252
come into your ears, and as you pull back, you
watch as these bits of greyish energy begin to

2863
03:21:08,252 --> 03:21:15,384
pour out of the air, coalescing around the blade,
fitting into the body where you're currently

2864
03:21:15,384 --> 03:21:22,179
plunged within. As you yank outward, you watch as
the blade almost has an extended edge about ten,

2865
03:21:22,179 --> 03:21:27,834
15 feet beyond Whisper's actual-- and this blade
edge just leaves a giant wound on the side of

2866
03:21:27,834 --> 03:21:39,266
Thordak's body. You don't even hear an exclamation
of pain as Thordak just slowly slams into the

2867
03:21:39,266 --> 03:21:52,686
ground of this low, barely glowing tunnel. Roll an
acrobatics check with disadvantage.

2868
03:21:52,686 --> 03:21:53,910
LIAM: 25.

2869
03:21:53,910 --> 03:21:54,868
MATT: 25.

2870
03:21:54,868 --> 03:21:56,281
SAM: Jesus.

2871
03:21:56,281 --> 03:22:01,087
MATT: So with the speed and impact of tumbling,
you manage to reduce the damage by half, so you--

2872
03:22:01,087 --> 03:22:03,754
LIAM: Which is also halved by the potion.

2873
03:22:03,754 --> 03:22:06,566
MATT: Right. That is 17 points of bludgeoning
damage.

2874
03:22:06,566 --> 03:22:09,296
LIAM: Is that the quarter?

2875
03:22:09,296 --> 03:22:18,174
MATT: No, that's halved. So that would bring it to
8. As you watch Thordak's form sputter, roll, and

2876
03:22:18,174 --> 03:22:23,884
then tumble, grinding to a halt, gathering a bunch
of stone, broken rock, and part of the cavern

2877
03:22:23,884 --> 03:22:29,513
that's on the verge of collapsing from the impact
of Thordak's body, now lifeless, still in the

2878
03:22:29,513 --> 03:22:32,115
darkness, subterranean tunnel.

2879
03:22:32,115 --> 03:22:34,117
And we're going to take a break.

2880
03:22:34,117 --> 03:22:38,857
(yelling)

2881
03:22:38,857 --> 03:22:52,976
TRAVIS: We don't even know it's happened, though,
yet! It's all underground!

2882
03:22:52,976 --> 03:22:55,736
TALIESIN: She would know.

2883
03:22:55,798 --> 03:22:59,535
LAURA: I do know. Can I fly forward before we take
the break?

2884
03:22:59,535 --> 03:23:01,143
MATT: You want to?

2885
03:23:01,143 --> 03:23:07,619
LAURA: I just want to fly forward and hug my
brother as he's just covered in dragon guts.

2886
03:23:07,619 --> 03:23:12,273
TALIESIN: He's way down in there. That's a long
flight.

2887
03:23:12,273 --> 03:23:23,764
MATT: And now we'll take a break. So we'll be back
here in a few minutes.

2888
03:23:23,764 --> 03:23:31,533
SAM: Don't forget, Backblaze is hosting a Critical
Role giveaway. Anyone who signs up for a free

2889
03:23:31,533 --> 03:23:37,034
trial with Backblaze at backblaze.com/criticalrole
through January 8th will be eligible to win items

2890
03:23:37,034 --> 03:23:40,503
signed by the Critical Role team that killed a
dragon.

2891
03:23:40,503 --> 03:23:44,493
MATT: Check out the video here during the break,
and we'll be back in a few minutes, guys.

2892
03:23:44,493 --> 03:37:21,343
[break]

2893
03:37:21,343 --> 03:37:26,325
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. First and foremost,
we have our winner in the chat for the Wyrmwood

2894
03:37:26,325 --> 03:37:29,174
dice tray. It is DetectiveKane!

2895
03:37:29,174 --> 03:37:32,128
(cheering)

2896
03:37:32,128 --> 03:37:37,509
MATT: You'll receive this awesome dice tray signed
by us. Half of us at the break, and the other half

2897
03:37:37,509 --> 03:37:41,048
will sign before the night is out. But it's coming
your way real soon. Congratulations,

2898
03:37:41,048 --> 03:37:44,243
DetectiveKane! Get this out of my fucking face!

2899
03:37:44,243 --> 03:37:45,754
LAURA: Nobody's there.

2900
03:37:45,754 --> 03:37:47,575
MATT: Somebody take it from me!

2901
03:37:47,575 --> 03:37:50,188
SAM: I don't even know that guy!

2902
03:37:50,188 --> 03:37:55,461
TALIESIN: I think I see half a dozen people on
their phones behind us.

2903
03:37:55,461 --> 03:38:01,004
MATT: It feels so good to be able to do that, but
it feels better when it's immediate. Otherwise, it

2904
03:38:01,004 --> 03:38:10,745
feels, like, kinda good. All right, so. Picking up
where we left off. The rest of you watch as

2905
03:38:10,745 --> 03:38:18,295
Thordak swooped into the hole that he emerged
from, quickly followed by Vex and Vax. There is

2906
03:38:18,295 --> 03:38:24,898
still on the field-- Raishan just tore into this
lizard man. We have a fire giant that is unscathed

2907
03:38:24,898 --> 03:38:30,460
currently, bearing down on the rest of the party,
and a wyvern rider back around this wall section

2908
03:38:30,460 --> 03:38:46,230
here. That being the case, they end that turn
there. First up is Lady Kima. Who is pissed that

2909
03:38:46,230 --> 03:38:49,785
she hasn't had a chance to really do anything
tonight against flying dragons.

2910
03:38:49,785 --> 03:38:51,580
TRAVIS: There's a big fire giant.

2911
03:38:51,580 --> 03:38:53,495
MATT: That's what she's going to do.

2912
03:38:53,495 --> 03:39:01,005
Paladins that don't fly and have haste have
a hard time getting around. Just so you know.

2913
03:39:01,005 --> 03:39:04,629
LAURA: Vestige!

2914
03:39:04,629 --> 03:39:13,345
MATT: Watching this giant whale upon Percy pisses
her off, and she cracks her neck. "You're first."

2915
03:39:13,345 --> 03:39:15,144
And she leaps down.

2916
03:39:15,144 --> 03:39:17,643
TRAVIS: Open him up!

2917
03:39:17,643 --> 03:39:32,726
MATT: And she's going to multi-attack against him.
That is-- that hits. And the other also hits. Even

2918
03:39:32,726 --> 03:39:40,372
with a minus five on each for her Great Weapon
Master. She's also going to Divine Smite on that

2919
03:39:40,372 --> 03:39:41,702
at a level three.

2920
03:39:41,702 --> 03:39:43,269
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it!

2921
03:39:43,269 --> 03:40:04,099
MATT: First strike is a 14, plus ten, 24. Plus 11,
35. 42 points of damage on her first strike

2922
03:40:04,099 --> 03:40:05,270
against the giant.

2923
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:06,785
TRAVIS: Boom!

2924
03:40:06,785 --> 03:40:22,870
MATT: And the second strike is 24 points of
damage. So that fire giant's already had a big

2925
03:40:22,870 --> 03:40:29,841
chunk taken out of its-- Kima rushes up and double
strikes with her Holy Avenger, one cleaving off a

2926
03:40:29,841 --> 03:40:34,691
piece of its armor, the second one cuts through,
leaving a giant flash of divine energy as it

2927
03:40:34,691 --> 03:40:44,359
bursts out the side. She looks up in the eyes and
says, "Bahamut says hi." That ends Kima's turn.

2928
03:40:44,359 --> 03:40:46,808
Pike is up now.

2929
03:40:46,808 --> 03:40:49,076
SAM: Oh, how's Pike doing?

2930
03:40:49,076 --> 03:40:52,905
LAURA: Pike-- oh, Pike's turn! Jesus.

2931
03:40:52,905 --> 03:40:54,390
LIAM: She's doing great.

2932
03:40:54,390 --> 03:40:55,706
TRAVIS: Head out of ass.

2933
03:40:55,706 --> 03:40:57,085
LAURA: I'm sorry! Okay.

2934
03:40:57,085 --> 03:40:58,494
LIAM: She's in Manhattan.

2935
03:40:58,494 --> 03:40:59,654
LAURA: She stands up.

2936
03:40:59,654 --> 03:41:13,239
MATT: Technically-- I was going to say, the giant
was going on Thordak's turn order. So I

2937
03:41:13,239 --> 03:41:18,100
technically skipped the giant's turn. That's fine.
I'll do the giant's turn now.

2938
03:41:18,100 --> 03:41:19,446
LAURA: Okay.

2939
03:41:19,446 --> 03:41:26,673
MATT: The giant, who has watched Percy get pulled away,
steps in to get into melee range with both Kima

2940
03:41:26,673 --> 03:41:27,681
and Grog.

2941
03:41:27,681 --> 03:41:29,271
TRAVIS: That's such a mistake.

2942
03:41:29,271 --> 03:41:38,576
MATT: And is going to take a strike on each. Takes
an attack on Kima and rolls-- that's a 20, that

2943
03:41:38,576 --> 03:41:44,401
hits. And then roll Grog-- that is a 29.

2944
03:41:44,401 --> 03:41:45,743
TRAVIS: That hits.

2945
03:41:45,743 --> 03:42:05,606
MATT: That's 28 points of damage to Kima and--
it's fun to roll against the players. 33 points of

2946
03:42:05,606 --> 03:42:08,633
slashing damage against you, Grog.

2947
03:42:08,633 --> 03:42:10,258
TRAVIS: So halved to, math?

2948
03:42:10,258 --> 03:42:11,235
MATT: 16.

2949
03:42:11,235 --> 03:42:24,233
TRAVIS: Thank you. I will use my Retaliation. The
old chin turned back. Reckless. Great Weapon

2950
03:42:24,233 --> 03:42:32,709
Master. That's better. 21.

2951
03:42:32,709 --> 03:42:34,787
MATT: 21. That hits.

2952
03:42:34,787 --> 03:42:45,921
TRAVIS: Nice. 21, that was crap. And 22. Both
ones. 22 plus ten is 32.

2953
03:42:45,921 --> 03:42:52,848
MATT: 32 points of damage, nice. The giant already
in that round of attacks and your retaliation is--

2954
03:42:52,848 --> 03:43:00,844
it has its giant greatsword on the ground, it's
rearing up for its next round of arcing attacks.

2955
03:43:00,844 --> 03:43:04,513
That brings us to Pike. What's Pike doing now?

2956
03:43:04,513 --> 03:43:18,337
LAURA: Okay, Pike stands up. She's going to run
forward and say, "You can't have all the fun,

2957
03:43:18,337 --> 03:43:29,493
"Grog!" And she's going to Guiding Bolt, level
four, at the fire giant.

2958
03:43:29,493 --> 03:43:32,188
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a melee spell
attack.

2959
03:43:32,188 --> 03:43:40,794
LAURA: Okay, okay. Okay, that's 18.

2960
03:43:40,794 --> 03:43:42,265
MATT: 18 just hits.

2961
03:43:42,265 --> 03:43:46,600
LAURA: Okay. Oh, wait. 17.

2962
03:43:46,600 --> 03:43:48,012
MATT: Nope.

2963
03:43:48,012 --> 03:43:49,760
LIAM: 17 sounds like 18.

2964
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:54,515
MATT: It does, but it's not the same. The giant
sees the flash of light as the bolt comes towards

2965
03:43:54,515 --> 03:44:00,470
it, out the corner of its eye. As it has its blade
down, it instead ducks underneath, using Grog for

2966
03:44:00,470 --> 03:44:06,263
cover briefly as it arcs past its shoulder and
shoots off through the cloud, out of sight.

2967
03:44:06,263 --> 03:44:12,550
MARISHA: What if it was 17.99? That's basically
like 18.

2968
03:44:12,550 --> 03:44:13,796
MATT: It's not.

2969
03:44:13,796 --> 03:44:15,215
LIAM: Crazy Eddie prices?

2970
03:44:15,215 --> 03:44:17,629
TRAVIS: Taco Bell logic right there.

2971
03:44:17,629 --> 03:44:27,201
LAURA: She says, "So, sorry! I guess you do have
all the fun. How are you on hit points, Grog? You okay?"

2972
03:44:27,201 --> 03:44:28,513
TRAVIS: Yep.

2973
03:44:28,513 --> 03:44:31,718
LAURA: Okay, then she's going to Healing Word
herself at first level.

2974
03:44:31,718 --> 03:44:34,702
MATT: Okay. d4 plus five.

2975
03:44:34,702 --> 03:44:38,324
LAURA: Okay, that's six points.

2976
03:44:38,324 --> 03:44:41,341
MATT: There you go. Six points to Pike. Scanlan,
you're up.

2977
03:44:41,341 --> 03:44:44,155
SAM: We're fighting this fucking giant thing?

2978
03:44:44,155 --> 03:44:45,436
LIAM: Yeah, man.

2979
03:44:45,436 --> 03:44:58,340
SAM: Jesus. I'm going to move out from my hidey
hole. Oh god, there's a giant there. I think my

2980
03:44:58,340 --> 03:45:04,315
Bigby's is still on the field, yeah. So I'll
Bigby's Punch. Bigby Punch!

2981
03:45:04,315 --> 03:45:08,726
MATT: Yeah, Bigby could just get into range melee
there for it.

2982
03:45:08,726 --> 03:45:13,723
SAM: A 24?

2983
03:45:13,723 --> 03:45:16,044
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll your 6d8.

2984
03:45:16,044 --> 03:45:21,012
SAM: 6d8, oh man. I only have one d8. I'll roll it
six times.

2985
03:45:21,012 --> 03:45:22,429
MARISHA: Do you want some d8s?

2986
03:45:22,429 --> 03:45:23,862
SAM: I'll roll it six times.

2987
03:45:23,862 --> 03:45:26,408
MARISHA: No, that's-- oh, he's already committed.

2988
03:45:26,408 --> 03:45:31,839
TRAVIS: Mad d8's. Oh, he's stroking out.

2989
03:45:31,839 --> 03:45:34,103
MARISHA: Should we do what he does to us? 15!

2990
03:45:34,103 --> 03:45:35,506
SAM: That was four.

2991
03:45:35,506 --> 03:45:38,398
TRAVIS: Flirted with the edge.

2992
03:45:38,398 --> 03:45:40,439
LAURA: 15. 15.

2993
03:45:40,439 --> 03:45:41,549
TALIESIN: 23.

2994
03:45:41,549 --> 03:45:42,648
MARISHA: 15.

2995
03:45:42,648 --> 03:45:44,075
SAM: You fuckers!

2996
03:45:44,075 --> 03:45:45,948
TALIESIN: This doesn't feel good on the other end,
does it?

2997
03:45:45,948 --> 03:45:53,038
SAM: Oh, shit, that was a lot! It's either 33 or
34, they fucked me up. But it was a lot! It was

2998
03:45:53,038 --> 03:45:54,706
mostly sevens and eights!

2999
03:45:54,706 --> 03:46:00,537
MATT: We'll go with 34 on that. Cool. So, as the
giant ducks out of the way of the Guiding Bolt

3000
03:46:00,537 --> 03:46:05,755
streaking past, it snickers and grins, says
something in Giant which you hear, which is--

3001
03:46:05,755 --> 03:46:07,171
TRAVIS: (gasps)

3002
03:46:07,171 --> 03:46:09,707
MATT: You didn't even hear what he said yet!

3003
03:46:09,707 --> 03:46:14,431
TRAVIS: Oh. I will hold my reaction.

3004
03:46:14,431 --> 03:46:19,293
MATT: "Insolents, bow to your king!"

3005
03:46:19,293 --> 03:46:21,642
TRAVIS: No.

3006
03:46:21,642 --> 03:46:26,827
MATT: And then, as it brings the sword up, while
it saw the glimmer of the Guiding Bolt, it didn't

3007
03:46:26,827 --> 03:46:31,360
see the purple glimmer of the shining fist as it
comes up and whack right across the jaw,

3008
03:46:31,360 --> 03:46:37,463
dislocating it briefly as the fist comes back up
and is ready for another round. Still standing,

3009
03:46:37,463 --> 03:46:40,781
but looking pretty rough. That brings us to--

3010
03:46:40,781 --> 03:46:45,890
SAM: That was my bonus action. As my action, I
will swig a Greater Healing Potion.

3011
03:46:45,890 --> 03:46:47,369
MATT: Okay.

3012
03:46:47,369 --> 03:46:48,733
SAM: What is that, four?

3013
03:46:48,733 --> 03:46:51,327
MATT: Greater Healing Potion is 4d4 plus four,
yeah.

3014
03:46:51,327 --> 03:46:53,604
TALIESIN: Oh, 4d4 plus six!

3015
03:46:53,604 --> 03:47:04,378
SAM: Yeah, the potion doesn't do that for me, does
it? Plus four? Four, three, two, one is ten, right?

3016
03:47:04,378 --> 03:47:07,861
MATT: Yes. So 14 hit points you heal.

3017
03:47:07,861 --> 03:47:15,150
LAURA: When you were healing Pike with the
superior, did you add--

3018
03:47:15,150 --> 03:47:17,236
SAM: You're right, it's two less than I thought.

3019
03:47:17,236 --> 03:47:20,729
LAURA: Oh, okay. So she's at 40 healed points now,
not 42.

3020
03:47:20,729 --> 03:47:27,466
SAM: I get a plus six when I cast it, because of
my awesomeness.

3021
03:47:27,466 --> 03:47:28,563
MATT: Correct.

3022
03:47:28,563 --> 03:47:29,801
SAM: But not when I use a potion.

3023
03:47:29,801 --> 03:47:30,691
MATT: Correct.

3024
03:47:30,691 --> 03:47:31,789
SAM: Got it.

3025
03:47:31,789 --> 03:47:36,716
MATT: All righty. Scanlan, that finish your turn?

3026
03:47:36,716 --> 03:47:38,391
SAM: Yeah, I think I'm done.

3027
03:47:38,391 --> 03:47:39,524
MATT: Percival.

3028
03:47:39,524 --> 03:47:46,838
TALIESIN: I'm going to put Bad News away, pull out
Animus and take three shots at this asshole.

3029
03:47:46,838 --> 03:47:48,435
MATT: Okay. So are you getting up?

3030
03:47:48,435 --> 03:47:54,017
TALIESIN: I'm getting up. Pulling out the gun,
putting three sharpshooter shots in this guy.

3031
03:47:54,017 --> 03:47:55,523
MATT: Go for it.

3032
03:47:55,523 --> 03:48:06,186
TALIESIN: That's a 26. That hits. I'm going to
roll that one until he drops, so that I can-- 1d8

3033
03:48:06,186 --> 03:48:14,905
plus 1d6. 1d10 plus 1d6. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 21
points of damage plus four points of psychic

3034
03:48:14,905 --> 03:48:17,014
damage, so 25 points of damage.

3035
03:48:17,014 --> 03:48:18,820
MATT: All righty.

3036
03:48:18,820 --> 03:48:26,905
TALIESIN: Second shot. That's 21 to hit.

3037
03:48:26,905 --> 03:48:28,133
MATT: Hits.

3038
03:48:28,133 --> 03:48:32,505
SAM: Right? Plus three plus two plus one...

3039
03:48:32,505 --> 03:48:42,143
TALIESIN: That's... Not right now, you bastard! I
hate you! That's 27 plus... 27 points of damage

3040
03:48:42,143 --> 03:48:46,443
plus one point of psychic damage to me because I
can't think!

3041
03:48:46,443 --> 03:48:49,051
MARISHA: He needs horse blinders! Horse blinders!

3042
03:48:49,051 --> 03:48:54,174
TALIESIN: So 27 points of damage plus one... I'm
so sorry.

3043
03:48:54,174 --> 03:48:56,466
SAM: What goes around comes around!

3044
03:48:56,466 --> 03:49:03,834
MATT: So as the fist clocks him across the face,
dislocating the jaw, it stands up and grabs the

3045
03:49:03,834 --> 03:49:11,098
jaw and snaps it back into place. Looks up just in
time for you to come up out of the shadow and

3046
03:49:11,098 --> 03:49:16,845
(gunshots), turning the barrels, you fire, and the
first shot hits in the side of the throat and

3047
03:49:16,845 --> 03:49:21,995
blows open the neck. And you see as the blood
begins to gout out, reaches up with a hand and it

3048
03:49:21,995 --> 03:49:26,918
(gasps) but it's to no use as the other shot takes
out the right eye, blowing out the back of the

3049
03:49:26,918 --> 03:49:28,747
giant's head as it falls backward.

3050
03:49:28,747 --> 03:49:33,486
SAM: Violence, violence! Who would've thought a
fire giant would be so easy?

3051
03:49:33,486 --> 03:49:36,724
TALIESIN: I am now going to start making my way to
the-- I'm going to start running my way to the

3052
03:49:36,724 --> 03:49:40,328
pit. With what little movement I have because I
got up.

3053
03:49:40,328 --> 03:49:47,029
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends Percy's turn. Top
of the round, the lair actions do not function.

3054
03:49:47,029 --> 03:49:53,834
However, you watch as the skyship Deera, still
rotating around, there's still wyverns attacking.

3055
03:49:53,834 --> 03:49:59,254
You hear the distant sounds of lightning cracks as
well. And you hear very, very distantly what

3056
03:49:59,254 --> 03:50:11,713
sounds like a-- sorry, internet-- a cacophony of
voices. Because there's no other word to describe

3057
03:50:11,713 --> 03:50:19,931
it. Hundreds and hundreds of voices, all shouting
combat war cries simultaneously. You have no idea

3058
03:50:19,931 --> 03:50:25,683
how far away it is, it's very, very faint, you
just pick it up. You hear the sound of impacts, of

3059
03:50:25,683 --> 03:50:30,908
crumbling stone in the distance. There is a battle
happening all throughout the city that is slowly

3060
03:50:30,908 --> 03:50:40,011
making its way towards your current location.
Deera's turned around and is going to take two

3061
03:50:40,011 --> 03:50:45,785
shots at Raishan, because it's going to fire at
whatever dragons are there. Damon was not notified

3062
03:50:45,785 --> 03:50:47,232
of anything otherwise.

3063
03:50:47,232 --> 03:50:49,634
LAURA: You know what, if Raishan gets hit, she
gets hit.

3064
03:50:49,634 --> 03:50:54,731
MATT: Rolled an eight, and an eight. No, it does
not hit. Oh, she gets three attacks, because the--

3065
03:50:54,731 --> 03:50:58,018
TRAVIS: What?

3066
03:50:58,018 --> 03:51:05,233
MATT: Three eights in a row. That's ridiculous.
Yeah! That's not a three, that's an eight. Absurd.

3067
03:51:05,233 --> 03:51:12,380
So yeah, (boom, boom, boom) all on the ground, and
Raishan spins in place (growls), "Call off your

3068
03:51:12,380 --> 03:51:14,669
"dogs! We still have a deal!"

3069
03:51:14,669 --> 03:51:17,623
TRAVIS: We literally have no power over them.

3070
03:51:17,623 --> 03:51:20,630
TALIESIN: I'll respond. To the pit! Now!

3071
03:51:20,630 --> 03:51:26,485
MATT: Which, Raishan at this point is now leaping
(whoosh) and disappears into the portal-- or down

3072
03:51:26,485 --> 03:51:28,196
into the hole in the ground.

3073
03:51:28,196 --> 03:51:31,284
TALIESIN: She was already going that way, she
doesn't get into shit with that.

3074
03:51:31,284 --> 03:51:33,093
LAURA: I want her to get hit.

3075
03:51:33,093 --> 03:51:35,511
TALIESIN: She's not going to get-- She's going in
the tunnel.

3076
03:51:35,511 --> 03:51:49,008
MATT: All right. At this point, full speed, that
is-- 60 feet, yeah. You guys, as you're having

3077
03:51:49,008 --> 03:51:50,929
this moment hugging each other--

3078
03:51:50,929 --> 03:51:52,797
LAURA: Hugs!

3079
03:51:52,797 --> 03:52:00,736
MATT: You hear (wings flapping) (smash) The ground
shakes nearby as you turn and see, you watch as

3080
03:52:00,736 --> 03:52:08,070
Raishan skids to a halt right next to you and the
currently smashed corpse of Thordak within the

3081
03:52:08,070 --> 03:52:09,464
tunnel.

3082
03:52:09,464 --> 03:52:17,017
MARISHA: Can I say over like a headpiece thing--
Be like, twins, if you're still alive, I think

3083
03:52:17,017 --> 03:52:19,250
Raishan's coming in your direction.

3084
03:52:19,250 --> 03:52:21,536
LIAM: Thanks for that.

3085
03:52:21,536 --> 03:52:29,225
MATT: Raishan is watching both of you as she
begins to walk towards Thordak's corpse and goes,

3086
03:52:29,225 --> 03:52:32,737
"You've done well."

3087
03:52:32,737 --> 03:52:35,478
LIAM: Yeah, what now?

3088
03:52:35,478 --> 03:52:37,503
TALIESIN: Every six seconds, we get to move.

3089
03:52:37,503 --> 03:52:40,994
MARISHA: Yeah, we're heading ass-- Hauling ass
that way!

3090
03:52:40,994 --> 03:52:42,727
TALIESIN: Booking with my spider walk.

3091
03:52:42,727 --> 03:52:44,381
LAURA: I'm heading ass-wherever!

3092
03:52:44,381 --> 03:52:47,124
TALIESIN: Running down the ceiling upside-down.

3093
03:52:47,124 --> 03:52:50,950
TRAVIS: Not me, I'm putting out that last fire on
the map.

3094
03:52:50,950 --> 03:52:55,369
LAURA: Stomp, stomp, stomp!

3095
03:52:55,369 --> 03:52:56,973
SAM: He's volunteer fire department, yeah.

3096
03:52:56,973 --> 03:52:59,744
MATT: 80 foot flying, this wyvern swoops in.

3097
03:52:59,744 --> 03:53:01,611
SAM: Ah, there's a fucking wyvern?

3098
03:53:01,611 --> 03:53:03,445
LIAM: Keyleth.

3099
03:53:03,445 --> 03:53:06,489
MATT: The one that was left earlier, that was
after you, is going to swoop in and attempt to

3100
03:53:06,489 --> 03:53:13,629
make two strikes at Kima. Miss. And a three. Miss.
And the rider's going to go ahead and make two

3101
03:53:13,629 --> 03:53:21,450
strikes at her as well. Miss with a 17. And a two!
Kima's like deflecting, getting against the wall

3102
03:53:21,450 --> 03:53:26,160
as the spear shoots by and as the blade comes down
from the rider, she strikes it with the sword and

3103
03:53:26,160 --> 03:53:32,358
stops it mid-air, and she starts laughing in his
face. That ends its go.

3104
03:53:32,358 --> 03:53:33,953
TRAVIS: Trinity.

3105
03:53:33,953 --> 03:53:36,309
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

3106
03:53:36,309 --> 03:53:42,558
SAM: Keyleth! There's a wyvern on the field. Or
you can ignore and go into the hole.

3107
03:53:42,558 --> 03:53:49,310
MARISHA: Fuck that wyvern. I say, everyone in the
hole! And I head towards the hole.

3108
03:53:49,310 --> 03:53:51,478
TALIESIN: We're going to need light down here.

3109
03:53:51,478 --> 03:53:53,345
SAM: (singing) Head to the hole!

3110
03:53:53,345 --> 03:53:55,043
MATT: Are you doing a double move?

3111
03:53:55,043 --> 03:53:56,768
MARISHA: (singing) Black as your soul! What?

3112
03:53:56,768 --> 03:53:58,610
MATT: Double move? Are you doing a dash action?

3113
03:53:58,610 --> 03:54:01,918
SAM: You've got nothing else to do.

3114
03:54:01,918 --> 03:54:05,068
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll dash.

3115
03:54:05,068 --> 03:54:16,419
MATT: Okay. So you begin to make it into the hole.
That brings us to Jarett's turn. Jarett is going

3116
03:54:16,419 --> 03:54:23,345
to turn the corner, he's like, "So it's gone?
Okay, good." Loads the crossbow, sees the wyvern,

3117
03:54:23,345 --> 03:54:31,131
and goes, "Are you-- no, are you-- seriously?" and
takes his shots. Nice, 19. Yeah, two shots against

3118
03:54:31,131 --> 03:54:32,416
the wyvern.

3119
03:54:32,416 --> 03:54:36,352
LAURA: Nice. This is his level, this is what
Jarett needs at a time.

3120
03:54:36,352 --> 03:54:37,731
LIAM: This is the Jarett we know.

3121
03:54:37,731 --> 03:54:42,152
MATT: 14 points of damage. He's not the heroic
individual you guys are necessarily.

3122
03:54:42,152 --> 03:54:43,743
MARISHA: Look, he's a great security guard.

3123
03:54:43,743 --> 03:54:48,673
LAURA: He is bad-ass.

3124
03:54:48,673 --> 03:54:51,256
MATT: He is, in his own field.

3125
03:54:51,256 --> 03:54:54,283
LIAM: He caught my sister's attention, anyone that
does that has got to have a lot of spunk.

3126
03:54:54,283 --> 03:54:58,294
MATT: All righty. So that ends his turn there,
those two shots. Both sink into the wyvern, both

3127
03:54:58,294 --> 03:55:07,051
bolt stuns (snarling). That will end his go.
Gilmore, recognizing the circumstance here and

3128
03:55:07,051 --> 03:55:15,452
everyone's rushing in there, he's going to go
ahead and... okay, he'll go, "Actually, me first."

3129
03:55:15,452 --> 03:55:24,879
And he Dimension Doors to the edge, and begins to
charge in after you guys. That brings us to Grog.

3130
03:55:24,879 --> 03:55:27,534
TRAVIS: I want to kill all the things that are
alive.

3131
03:55:27,534 --> 03:55:33,493
MATT: Okay. So you move into melee with the wyvern
and the rider.

3132
03:55:33,493 --> 03:55:42,775
TRAVIS: Yeah. Great Weapon Master, Reckless.
Eight, 15, 19.

3133
03:55:42,775 --> 03:55:44,086
MATT: Hits.

3134
03:55:44,086 --> 03:55:45,998
MARISHA: Kill it real hard.

3135
03:55:45,998 --> 03:55:55,631
TRAVIS: 16. 22. Ooh! 26. 36. For the first hit.

3136
03:55:55,631 --> 03:56:01,109
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you're
going to wipe out the wyvern.

3137
03:56:01,109 --> 03:56:02,218
TRAVIS: Yay!

3138
03:56:02,218 --> 03:56:04,386
MATT: Because you're giant Grog.

3139
03:56:04,386 --> 03:56:05,801
TRAVIS: Is the lizard man left?

3140
03:56:05,801 --> 03:56:07,194
MATT: The lizard man is left, yes.

3141
03:56:07,194 --> 03:56:08,658
TRAVIS: Can I give him the option to run?

3142
03:56:08,658 --> 03:56:09,763
MATT: If you want to.

3143
03:56:09,763 --> 03:56:11,297
TRAVIS: Nah, fuck that. I kill him, too.

3144
03:56:11,297 --> 03:56:15,503
MATT: Well, all three of your attacks would be
what it would take to take out the wyvern.

3145
03:56:15,503 --> 03:56:16,760
TRAVIS: Hey! Oh, cool.

3146
03:56:16,760 --> 03:56:20,700
MATT: So as you finish cleaving the wyvern down,
it falls over and the lizard man's like (snarls).

3147
03:56:20,700 --> 03:56:23,713
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do this.

3148
03:56:23,713 --> 03:56:29,574
MATT: (reptilian whimper) It looks conflicted.

3149
03:56:29,574 --> 03:56:34,146
TRAVIS: You're at a crossroads, bro. Crossroads.

3150
03:56:34,146 --> 03:56:39,056
MATT: Vex. It's your go.

3151
03:56:39,056 --> 03:56:40,503
LAURA: Okay.

3152
03:56:40,503 --> 03:56:46,709
MATT: You have Raishan like (booming footsteps)
stepping over to Thordak's body, watching you

3153
03:56:46,709 --> 03:56:47,992
closely.

3154
03:56:47,992 --> 03:56:49,798
LAURA: What are you doing?

3155
03:56:49,798 --> 03:56:54,400
MATT: "Exactly what we talked about. Learning his
secret."

3156
03:56:54,400 --> 03:57:04,856
LAURA: I'm going to keep my hand ready to attack
and hold my action until anything gets aggressive

3157
03:57:04,856 --> 03:57:06,464
with Raishan.

3158
03:57:06,464 --> 03:57:07,763
MATT: Okay.

3159
03:57:07,763 --> 03:57:11,968
TALIESIN: What do you see down there? What's
happening, what's in the room?

3160
03:57:11,968 --> 03:57:13,903
LAURA: Thordak is dead.

3161
03:57:13,903 --> 03:57:15,344
TALIESIN: What's in the room?

3162
03:57:15,344 --> 03:57:17,192
LAURA: Oh, what do I see around me?

3163
03:57:17,192 --> 03:57:22,992
MATT: The tunnel that you're in, it's been a
steady decline. It's rounded off a little bit and

3164
03:57:22,992 --> 03:57:29,524
it begins to open up maybe 70 feet ahead of you.
Actually, with your darkvision, you would just

3165
03:57:29,524 --> 03:57:34,149
barely start to see it begin to open, it looks
like there's an actual chamber ahead of all of you

3166
03:57:34,149 --> 03:57:35,933
guys, but you haven't reached it yet.

3167
03:57:35,933 --> 03:57:38,889
TRAVIS: The shitter.

3168
03:57:38,889 --> 03:57:50,795
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my movement to back
away from Raishan towards the chamber. But I'm

3169
03:57:50,795 --> 03:57:54,896
going to hold my attack until I think it's
aggressive.

3170
03:57:54,896 --> 03:58:00,446
MATT: Okay. So as you move in, you can see there's
a very, very faint glow of orange and red in the

3171
03:58:00,446 --> 03:58:10,513
room, and the whole tunnel here has a very, very,
very concentrated natural burning chemical smell

3172
03:58:10,513 --> 03:58:24,404
to it. A lot of sulfur-type, very putrid, pungent
smells. And the glow you can now see, there is a

3173
03:58:24,404 --> 03:58:30,119
lava flow that is coalescing in the center of this
room, or at least is pouring through, and it looks

3174
03:58:30,119 --> 03:58:35,953
like it's bisecting this room. You don't make out
much more detail than that at this distance, but

3175
03:58:35,953 --> 03:58:39,511
you do see this chamber does have an actual flow
of liquid rock.

3176
03:58:39,511 --> 03:58:41,019
LAURA: Okay.

3177
03:58:41,019 --> 03:58:42,769
MATT: Vax.

3178
03:58:42,769 --> 03:58:44,706
LIAM: Keyleth? You tell me.

3179
03:58:44,706 --> 03:58:52,272
MARISHA: What's going on? Whatcha doing?

3180
03:58:52,272 --> 03:58:53,875
LIAM: You tell me.

3181
03:58:53,875 --> 03:58:57,468
MARISHA: Just describe the scene.

3182
03:58:57,468 --> 03:58:59,051
LIAM: Hit or wait?

3183
03:58:59,051 --> 03:59:02,016
MARISHA: Wait till I'm there! Wait till I'm
there!

3184
03:59:02,016 --> 03:59:03,211
LIAM: What?

3185
03:59:03,211 --> 03:59:04,889
MARISHA: Wait till I'm there!

3186
03:59:04,889 --> 03:59:08,254
LIAM: I'm going to hold my turn until Keyleth
acts.

3187
03:59:08,254 --> 03:59:14,420
MATT: Okay. Pike, Scanlan, you guys all follow
suit?

3188
03:59:14,420 --> 03:59:15,543
SAM: Yeah.

3189
03:59:15,543 --> 03:59:20,754
MATT: Okay, at a full run you guys can get, at
your tiny feet you can get up towards the edge

3190
03:59:20,754 --> 03:59:21,761
there.

3191
03:59:21,761 --> 03:59:25,022
TALIESIN: I'm at a full run on the roof.

3192
03:59:25,022 --> 03:59:34,307
MATT: Right, Percival. Yeah, you do, you get up
there and inside. Raishan comes up to the body of

3193
03:59:34,307 --> 03:59:44,946
Thordak and you see that she reaches up under one
of her scales and pulls out a small leather case.

3194
03:59:44,946 --> 03:59:46,802
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3195
03:59:46,802 --> 03:59:48,542
MATT: Pops open the case.

3196
03:59:48,542 --> 03:59:50,782
MARISHA: Don't let her touch him.

3197
03:59:50,782 --> 03:59:59,160
MATT: And sits back and pulls open a somewhat
weathered scroll. And starts reading off of it.

3198
03:59:59,160 --> 04:00:02,257
(magical language)

3199
04:00:02,257 --> 04:00:03,988
LAURA: Oh, no, what is this?

3200
04:00:03,988 --> 04:00:06,395
MARISHA: No no no! Don't go, don't go--

3201
04:00:06,395 --> 04:00:10,855
LIAM: Attack. I'm attacking her. She acted, she
said don't touch, I said I'll base it off of

3202
04:00:10,855 --> 04:00:13,675
Keyleth, so I'm attacking. I'm going to interrupt
that.

3203
04:00:13,675 --> 04:00:16,499
TRAVIS: Don't you want to see what happens?

3204
04:00:16,499 --> 04:00:17,863
LIAM: No.

3205
04:00:17,863 --> 04:00:21,975
MATT: Okay. Hold on. You say attack based on--
Because you don't see this yet.

3206
04:00:21,975 --> 04:00:25,494
MARISHA: I said don't let her touch him.

3207
04:00:25,494 --> 04:00:27,250
TRAVIS: She's reading that scroll, man.

3208
04:00:27,250 --> 04:00:29,735
MATT: She hasn't touched him yet. But you're
attacking on your own instinct.

3209
04:00:29,735 --> 04:00:33,713
LIAM: If I've heard don't let her touch him, and
she's doing that, those two things mean the same

3210
04:00:33,713 --> 04:00:36,949
thing to me. She's doing something. Yes.

3211
04:00:36,949 --> 04:00:41,012
MATT: All right. I will say, for this, go ahead
and make a dexterity check.

3212
04:00:41,012 --> 04:00:47,627
LIAM: Dexterity check? All right. And I'll use my
last Luck of the day.

3213
04:00:47,627 --> 04:00:49,628
SAM: I thought you did that already.

3214
04:00:49,628 --> 04:00:52,867
LIAM: I had two. So that's a 28.

3215
04:00:52,867 --> 04:00:59,286
MATT: 28, okay. So you can make your attack. This
with the dagger?

3216
04:00:59,286 --> 04:01:02,242
LIAM: This is everything. How far away is she from
me?

3217
04:01:02,242 --> 04:01:04,756
MATT: She's maybe like 20 feet, so you can--

3218
04:01:04,756 --> 04:01:06,110
LIAM: All three attacks.

3219
04:01:06,110 --> 04:01:09,177
MATT: Well, you held your action, which means you
can only take your action, you can't move as well.

3220
04:01:09,177 --> 04:01:12,216
LIAM: Okay. Move? I don't need to move. How far
away is she, you said--

3221
04:01:12,216 --> 04:01:13,193
MATT: 20 feet.

3222
04:01:13,193 --> 04:01:15,444
LIAM: 20 feet. So I can throw daggers at her,
right?

3223
04:01:15,444 --> 04:01:17,064
LAURA: Yeah, but you can't throw your sword

3224
04:01:17,064 --> 04:01:22,488
LIAM: No, but I have lots of daggers. I still have
the Flametongue Dagger, which is not attuned, it's

3225
04:01:22,488 --> 04:01:23,760
just a lame old dagger.

3226
04:01:23,760 --> 04:01:25,761
MATT: That's true, you can do that, yeah. So yeah,
you can do that.

3227
04:01:25,761 --> 04:01:27,491
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

3228
04:01:27,491 --> 04:01:31,096
LIAM: First one is a 23.

3229
04:01:31,096 --> 04:01:32,726
MATT: A 23?

3230
04:01:32,726 --> 04:01:36,072
LIAM: Second one is a 19.

3231
04:01:36,072 --> 04:01:40,764
Third one is a 29.

3232
04:01:40,764 --> 04:01:47,160
MATT: Okay. So it was-- 29 hits. The first one...

3233
04:01:47,160 --> 04:01:50,011
LIAM: God. I don't remember.

3234
04:01:50,011 --> 04:01:51,353
LAURA: A 23.

3235
04:01:51,353 --> 04:01:52,999
LIAM: 23 sounds familiar.

3236
04:01:52,999 --> 04:01:57,719
MATT: Right. The 19 was the one that didn't hit.

3237
04:01:57,719 --> 04:02:02,318
LIAM: So two of the three hit? So it was
hit-miss-hit, right? I think so. All right, so the

3238
04:02:02,318 --> 04:02:13,807
first one is Whisper. Four plus eight is 12, plus
psychic damage is 15, but there's no sneak attack,

3239
04:02:13,807 --> 04:02:18,671
because there's nobody near her, and the Hunter's
Mark-- Oh! Can I move Hunter's Mark to her at this

3240
04:02:18,671 --> 04:02:20,383
point? I have no idea.

3241
04:02:20,383 --> 04:02:22,348
MATT: No, because you've used all your attacks.

3242
04:02:22,348 --> 04:02:28,211
LIAM: It's a bonus? Okay. Got it. Okay. So 15 for
the first and the second one. Oh, I don't need

3243
04:02:28,211 --> 04:02:32,869
that. Is nine.

3244
04:02:32,869 --> 04:02:35,158
MATT: Okay, so what was the first attack? It
was--

3245
04:02:35,158 --> 04:02:36,631
LIAM: 15 plus nine.

3246
04:02:36,631 --> 04:02:42,943
MATT: 15? 15 plus nine. So the first attack was
15. Okay, maintains concentration. Maintains

3247
04:02:42,943 --> 04:02:44,008
concentration.

3248
04:02:44,008 --> 04:02:46,902
LIAM: And I'll use my movement to move between my
sister and Raishan.

3249
04:02:46,902 --> 04:02:48,847
LAURA: You can't do movement, because you were
holding your action.

3250
04:02:48,847 --> 04:02:50,107
LIAM: Okay.

3251
04:02:50,107 --> 04:02:57,241
MATT: Okay. So as both daggers come, you watch as
it's muttering from the scroll, not both of her

3252
04:02:57,241 --> 04:03:02,026
eyes, but one of the eyes turns to face you.

3253
04:03:02,026 --> 04:03:03,501
LAURA: Like a chameleon.

3254
04:03:03,501 --> 04:03:12,682
MATT: Yeah. And narrows. The scroll finishes and
(poof) turns to ash. And similar to something

3255
04:03:12,682 --> 04:03:21,002
you've seen before, you watch as Thordak's corpse,
which is currently buried into the rock with the

3256
04:03:21,002 --> 04:03:33,058
face to the side, the breath filters into the
mouth. The body still motionless, you recognize

3257
04:03:33,058 --> 04:03:36,668
this similar or adjacent magic to the Speak With
Dead--

3258
04:03:36,668 --> 04:03:38,014
LIAM: We've seen Pike do it.

3259
04:03:38,014 --> 04:03:39,299
MATT: Yes.

3260
04:03:39,299 --> 04:03:43,563
SAM: She's just trying to ask a question, Vax. I
mean, Jesus.

3261
04:03:43,563 --> 04:03:46,947
LIAM: You're not here.

3262
04:03:46,947 --> 04:03:55,947
MATT: So as soon as that finishes, Raishan-- the
other eye flickers over. Now both eyes are on you.

3263
04:03:55,947 --> 04:04:01,254
And says, "Know what you're doing."

3264
04:04:01,254 --> 04:04:13,685
LIAM: You're not walking away from this field.
You're going to die. Maybe I will too, but you are

3265
04:04:13,685 --> 04:04:15,951
going to die.

3266
04:04:15,951 --> 04:04:24,997
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

3267
04:04:24,997 --> 04:04:34,003
SAM: We're men of our word. We're men of honor.

3268
04:04:34,003 --> 04:04:38,907
MATT: Raishan is going to...

3269
04:04:38,907 --> 04:04:41,300
LAURA: She did attack our home.

3270
04:04:41,300 --> 04:04:44,322
SAM: I'm not saying she's great.

3271
04:04:44,322 --> 04:04:53,001
MATT: Hmm. Let me check one thing real fast.

3272
04:04:53,001 --> 04:04:57,203
SAM: Hmm. Oh boy. You stumped the chump.

3273
04:04:57,203 --> 04:05:02,431
MATT: Well, I'm trying to see what her reaction's
going to be. Oh, okay. She feels comfortable with

3274
04:05:02,431 --> 04:05:15,757
that. She goes, "Well, then. Come claim me!" And
just steps away from Thordak. And with one big

3275
04:05:15,757 --> 04:05:20,412
push of the wings, turns around and coasts into
the chamber beyond you.

3276
04:05:20,412 --> 04:05:22,051
LIAM: Out of sight?

3277
04:05:22,051 --> 04:05:26,901
MATT: Beyond, you can see her form disappear into
the darkness. There's a little bit of an orange

3278
04:05:26,901 --> 04:05:34,656
glow in there, but given that circumstance, yeah,
she disappears into the shadows of the room.

3279
04:05:34,656 --> 04:05:37,388
LAURA: Should I have taken my shots when things
got aggressive?

3280
04:05:37,388 --> 04:05:38,888
MARISHA: So she's coming towards us.

3281
04:05:38,888 --> 04:05:40,448
MATT: No, she's going the opposite direction.

3282
04:05:40,448 --> 04:05:47,408
LAURA: I mean, did that look aggressive?

3283
04:05:47,408 --> 04:05:53,366
MATT: She flew away from your brother. But your
brother did throw three daggers into her, and then

3284
04:05:53,366 --> 04:05:55,512
said she was going to die.

3285
04:05:55,512 --> 04:05:57,495
TRAVIS: Did she ask her questions of Thordak?

3286
04:05:57,495 --> 04:06:02,351
LAURA: It might not have been the same fucking
spell. It could have been something like it.

3287
04:06:02,351 --> 04:06:03,896
TRAVIS: He said it looked very similar.

3288
04:06:03,896 --> 04:06:05,252
LAURA: Yeah, adjacent.

3289
04:06:05,252 --> 04:06:08,822
LIAM: I'm sure she was just going to ask about
cooking recipes. It's fine.

3290
04:06:08,822 --> 04:06:13,761
MATT: So what are you going to do, attack or not?
You watched your brother throw three daggers into

3291
04:06:13,761 --> 04:06:20,939
Raishan, and tell her that she's going to die, and
then Raishan basically abandoned Thordak's body

3292
04:06:20,939 --> 04:06:22,397
and fled.

3293
04:06:22,397 --> 04:06:24,261
LAURA: Said, "Come and claim me," and flew toward
me?

3294
04:06:24,261 --> 04:06:28,694
MATT: Flew over you, and past, into the chamber.

3295
04:06:28,694 --> 04:06:31,936
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to attack.

3296
04:06:31,936 --> 04:06:34,943
MATT: Go for it. Roll your attacks!

3297
04:06:34,943 --> 04:06:39,352
LAURA: Oh no.

3298
04:06:39,352 --> 04:06:41,606
TRAVIS: Do it, Tiny Toon!

3299
04:06:41,606 --> 04:06:43,062
LIAM: Go for it.

3300
04:06:43,062 --> 04:06:44,447
SAM: You got this, Bailes.

3301
04:06:44,447 --> 04:06:48,237
MARISHA: I mean, she kind of released Thordak.
She's totally Little Finger.

3302
04:06:48,237 --> 04:06:49,799
LAURA: This isn't about vengeance, though, you
guys.

3303
04:06:49,799 --> 04:06:51,441
SAM: What is it about?

3304
04:06:51,441 --> 04:06:57,718
MATT: Roll your attacks.

3305
04:06:57,718 --> 04:07:01,189
LIAM: Five, four, three, two...

3306
04:07:01,189 --> 04:07:07,088
LAURA: I don't know. (sad noise) That one doesn't
hit. Probably. 18.

3307
04:07:07,088 --> 04:07:08,450
MATT: Nope.

3308
04:07:08,450 --> 04:07:11,599
LAURA: That one probably hits. 27?

3309
04:07:11,599 --> 04:07:12,811
MATT: Yeah.

3310
04:07:12,811 --> 04:07:14,491
(laughter)

3311
04:07:14,491 --> 04:07:16,909
SAM: Saddest attack ever.

3312
04:07:16,909 --> 04:07:20,544
LAURA: And a natural fucking one. Fenthras can
sense my trepidation.

3313
04:07:20,544 --> 04:07:26,086
MATT: Hah, apparently! So roll damage on one arrow
strike. And it is, your hand's shaking at this

3314
04:07:26,086 --> 04:07:31,405
moment, you're trying to figure out what to do. When
she flies overhead, you release one arrow, pull

3315
04:07:31,405 --> 04:07:35,495
back and pull another, and the second one is right
as she's over and above, sinks in. And the third one,

3316
04:07:35,495 --> 04:07:37,544
you fire after, and it hits the rock ceiling.

3317
04:07:37,544 --> 04:07:39,157
LAURA: Just 15 damage.

3318
04:07:39,157 --> 04:07:51,675
MATT: 15 points of damage. All righty. Raishan
just swoops into the darkness of the chamber

3319
04:07:51,675 --> 04:08:00,250
beyond. Keyleth. You just manage to catch up at
this point now, at a full run, this will be your

3320
04:08:00,250 --> 04:08:08,541
full turn, catching up to Vex and Vax. Or Vax
specifically, Vex is a little beyond, aggressive

3321
04:08:08,541 --> 04:08:12,428
stance, Raishan nowhere to be seen, Thordak's
corpse ground into the dirt.

3322
04:08:12,428 --> 04:08:14,525
MARISHA: Where is she?

3323
04:08:14,525 --> 04:08:16,044
LIAM: Forward.

3324
04:08:16,044 --> 04:08:20,307
MARISHA: Are we going after her? I mean--

3325
04:08:20,307 --> 04:08:21,793
TALIESIN: I'm not there.

3326
04:08:21,793 --> 04:08:23,779
LIAM: Yes.

3327
04:08:23,779 --> 04:08:26,306
MARISHA: I run deeper into the hole.

3328
04:08:26,306 --> 04:08:33,161
MATT: Okay. Jarett and Gilmore, at this point,
manage to catch up to you guys, as well. It'll

3329
04:08:33,161 --> 04:08:39,283
take a while for Grog and Kima to catch up to you
guys.

3330
04:08:39,283 --> 04:08:41,311
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't say I was leaving.

3331
04:08:41,311 --> 04:08:43,436
SAM: Looting the giant's body?

3332
04:08:43,436 --> 04:08:44,988
TRAVIS: No, there's a lizardfolk right there.

3333
04:08:44,988 --> 04:08:46,269
MATT: It's true, actually, yeah.

3334
04:08:46,269 --> 04:08:49,075
TRAVIS: I want to see how many licks it takes to
get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop.

3335
04:08:49,075 --> 04:08:51,863
SAM: One. It takes one lick.

3336
04:08:51,863 --> 04:08:54,904
MATT: Well, Grog, it's staring at you, going like
(growl).

3337
04:08:54,904 --> 04:08:56,434
TRAVIS: I reach out and go like (head crushing
sound).

3338
04:08:56,434 --> 04:08:59,795
MATT: Make a strength check.

3339
04:08:59,795 --> 04:09:01,858
TRAVIS: I have advantage on those.

3340
04:09:01,858 --> 04:09:03,948
(laughter)

3341
04:09:03,948 --> 04:09:09,523
TRAVIS: 18. 18 plus seven. 25.

3342
04:09:09,523 --> 04:09:19,004
MATT: 25? There's this moment where you're
grabbing its head, and it reaches up and (frantic snarl).

3343
04:09:19,004 --> 04:09:22,995
TRAVIS: Can't hear you, can't hear you.

3344
04:09:22,995 --> 04:09:24,540
(laughter)

3345
04:09:24,540 --> 04:09:31,598
MATT: A very Riki-oh type moment. The head just
pops outward in a smear of purple gore.

3346
04:09:31,598 --> 04:09:40,576
TRAVIS: Oh, no. That's the show, folks. All right.
Well. Anybody see that? Who's here?

3347
04:09:40,576 --> 04:09:42,085
SAM: My hand is near you.

3348
04:09:42,085 --> 04:09:43,529
TRAVIS: Kima's there, right?

3349
04:09:43,529 --> 04:09:48,385
MATT: (chuckles) Bigby's Hand claps the wall,
applause.

3350
04:09:48,385 --> 04:09:50,603
(laughter)

3351
04:09:50,603 --> 04:09:52,521
TRAVIS: Ha, fuck Bigby's Hand.

3352
04:09:52,521 --> 04:09:59,460
MATT: You look over at Kima, and Kima's kind of
spattered with it, and she goes, "Well done!"

3353
04:09:59,460 --> 04:10:01,903
TRAVIS: Smooth, right? Let's join everybody
else.

3354
04:10:01,913 --> 04:10:09,494
MATT: "All right, all right." You're going your
movement, about there, full speed. Kima's a little

3355
04:10:09,494 --> 04:10:18,725
slower behind. She'll catch up at a full
double-dash speed, there. Jarett and everybody

3356
04:10:18,725 --> 04:10:20,644
else has kind of moved in. We'll say at this
point, the rest of you--

3357
04:10:20,644 --> 04:10:22,331
LAURA: (laughs) Jarett is just like--

3358
04:10:22,331 --> 04:10:23,787
MATT: He can't do anything, he's having a bad day,
man.

3359
04:10:23,787 --> 04:10:27,997
MARISHA: Poor Jarett.

3360
04:10:27,997 --> 04:10:31,670
MATT: So you guys all charge in after?

3361
04:10:31,670 --> 04:10:35,174
TALIESIN: I'm doing the best I can, I can't see a
damn thing.

3362
04:10:35,174 --> 04:10:37,808
MATT: No, you guys are far behind. So it's
currently you three in the lead.

3363
04:10:37,808 --> 04:10:44,779
TRAVIS: Should anybody stay out here in case she
wants to come back out? You want me to stay out?

3364
04:10:44,779 --> 04:10:47,722
MATT: Do you want to move Bigby's Hand?

3365
04:10:47,722 --> 04:10:53,995
SAM: Yeah, for the rest of the one minute 
it works for. Which is not very long?

3366
04:10:53,995 --> 04:10:55,040
MATT: Nah.

3367
04:10:55,040 --> 04:10:59,331
TALIESIN: If she makes her way out, that means
we're all dead. Come on in. It'll be fun. Let's

3368
04:10:59,331 --> 04:11:02,006
all die together.

3369
04:11:02,006 --> 04:11:04,932
MARISHA: We'll go to the spa afterwards.

3370
04:11:04,932 --> 04:11:14,027
MATT: So you guys kind of rush into this chamber
now, and the heat in here is more immense than

3371
04:11:14,027 --> 04:11:21,478
anything you felt on the surface. This is kind of
the core of the volcanic surge that Thordak's

3372
04:11:21,478 --> 04:11:27,024
presence was pulling upward. You see within,
there's this flow of lava. I want the three of you

3373
04:11:27,024 --> 04:11:29,389
to roll perception checks, if you can.

3374
04:11:29,389 --> 04:11:33,728
SAM: Who's the three, Vax, Vex, and--

3375
04:11:33,728 --> 04:11:37,014
LIAM: 31. 31.

3376
04:11:37,014 --> 04:11:40,068
LAURA: This is at advantage because it's a
dragon-related thing?

3377
04:11:40,068 --> 04:11:46,047
MATT: Well, are you looking for Raishan, or are
you inspecting the room for details?

3378
04:11:46,047 --> 04:11:48,181
LAURA: I don't know, what am I rolling for?

3379
04:11:48,181 --> 04:11:51,304
MATT: I was rolling to see just the general
vicinity of the room.

3380
04:11:51,304 --> 04:11:52,836
LAURA: Okay, 27.

3381
04:11:52,836 --> 04:11:54,629
LIAM: 31.

3382
04:11:54,629 --> 04:11:55,741
MARISHA: 25.

3383
04:11:55,741 --> 04:12:04,835
MATT: You guys, the first thing you notice as you
glance around, is there are some kind of alcoves

3384
04:12:04,835 --> 04:12:14,766
inside this chamber where the rock formations pull
inward. You see kind of set into the stone and

3385
04:12:14,766 --> 04:12:23,110
various bits of fallen rock and earth, a handful,
somewhat spread out throughout the room, a handful

3386
04:12:23,110 --> 04:12:34,145
of large nine-foot-tall dark, deep crimson red
with crystalline elements to the outside, ovoid

3387
04:12:34,145 --> 04:12:53,190
structures. These are what appear to be larger
than normal, elementally altered dragon eggs. Five

3388
04:12:53,190 --> 04:12:55,187
of them in the chamber.

3389
04:12:55,187 --> 04:12:57,222
LAURA: Five bebes?!

3390
04:12:57,222 --> 04:13:02,446
SAM: (singing) Muppet Babies...

3391
04:13:02,446 --> 04:13:14,474
LAURA: Can I look back at Thordak? What does it
look like-- I know Raishan, like, (gasps) made him

3392
04:13:14,474 --> 04:13:17,825
do that. Does it look like there's anything around
him, or is he just dead-dead still?

3393
04:13:17,825 --> 04:13:24,229
MATT: He's a ways back. If you want to try and
move back to him, you can. But, with your high

3394
04:13:24,229 --> 04:13:30,438
perception, you glance up and see in the ceiling
portion of this chamber where there are a number

3395
04:13:30,438 --> 04:13:35,984
of these small caverns that are pressed up to the
side, you see out of the top just the slight

3396
04:13:35,984 --> 04:13:44,840
peeking of Raishan's face, kind of looking down
into the chamber above you. And you watch as the

3397
04:13:44,840 --> 04:13:51,615
teeth, something muttering in the mouth, the teeth
grin as the ceiling of the room, you watch

3398
04:13:51,615 --> 04:13:58,993
distortion in the air above you. Almost like these
small portals kind of (multiple fwooshes) open,

3399
04:13:58,993 --> 04:14:13,030
and coming flying out of them, you see four large,
flaming rocks. Rocks. These are massive, fiery,

3400
04:14:13,030 --> 04:14:20,023
meteorite-like boulders, that come firing out of
the ceiling of the room (crashing sounds).

3401
04:14:20,023 --> 04:14:25,027
Slamming into the ground around you, exploding in
a massive explosions, rocking you. All you see is

3402
04:14:25,027 --> 04:14:29,833
white, and ringing in your ears as your bodies are
thrown from explosion to explosion. I need the

3403
04:14:29,833 --> 04:14:32,284
three of you to make dexterity saving throws.

3404
04:14:32,284 --> 04:14:39,521
LIAM: 25.

3405
04:14:39,521 --> 04:14:44,284
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 19, so 22.

3406
04:14:44,284 --> 04:14:47,450
LAURA: 29.

3407
04:14:47,450 --> 04:14:51,163
SAM: Wow, guys! That's really good rolling!

3408
04:14:51,163 --> 04:15:01,288
MATT: You guys take half damage. Well, here, let's
do the first part. So, there's the fire damage.

3409
04:15:01,288 --> 04:15:03,847
Which is 20d6.

3410
04:15:03,847 --> 04:15:05,315
LIAM: What did we have to beat?

3411
04:15:05,315 --> 04:15:08,697
MATT: You had to beat 22.

3412
04:15:08,697 --> 04:15:11,083
LIAM: Zero.

3413
04:15:11,083 --> 04:15:18,942
MATT: Right, so you take zero damage from this.
Both of you take 63 points of fire damage. Halved,

3414
04:15:18,942 --> 04:15:25,885
to 31. And then you each take 70 points of
bludgeoning damage.

3415
04:15:25,885 --> 04:15:29,827
MARISHA: 70?

3416
04:15:29,827 --> 04:15:32,187
TRAVIS: That's 130-something total points.

3417
04:15:32,187 --> 04:15:42,366
MATT: As these flaming arcane meteors crash into
the ground, detonating and destroying a portion of

3418
04:15:42,366 --> 04:15:50,739
the cavern floor, lava spatters everywhere, and
you watch as you duck out of the way as, Keyleth,

3419
04:15:50,739 --> 04:15:52,536
what are your hit points at?

3420
04:15:52,536 --> 04:16:00,250
MARISHA: I'm actually still up at-- What's 101
minus 119? 18 points.

3421
04:16:00,250 --> 04:16:06,238
MATT: 18 points. Set your hit points to that. You
watch as your sister is thrown, her body

3422
04:16:06,238 --> 04:16:13,080
unconscious, flung in the air like a ragdoll as it
scatters to one end of the cavern. You can see the

3423
04:16:13,080 --> 04:16:18,351
volcanic activity billowing up from the recent
shaking of the room, as bits of the molten rock

3424
04:16:18,351 --> 04:16:27,395
are flung across, as the green dragon face kind of
withdraws in the cave. And I think that's where

3425
04:16:27,395 --> 04:16:28,946
we're going to pick up next year.

3426
04:16:28,946 --> 04:16:30,951
(yelling)

3427
04:16:30,951 --> 04:16:33,188
MATT: It's 11:22, guys! We gotta get home!

3428
04:16:33,188 --> 04:16:36,088
SAM: Next year?! We have to wait a year?!

3429
04:16:36,088 --> 04:16:40,217
LAURA: I have to find out if I'm for sure dead.

3430
04:16:40,217 --> 04:16:42,201
LIAM: I got you, I got you.

3431
04:16:42,201 --> 04:16:43,951
LAURA: I'm across the fucking room.

3432
04:16:43,951 --> 04:16:47,808
LIAM: Doesn't matter, I can fly 500 feet, I got
you.

3433
04:16:47,808 --> 04:16:50,976
TALIESIN: You're going to get the conclusion of
this before the next season of Westworld.

3434
04:16:50,976 --> 04:16:52,746
LIAM: Lay on Hands, dude.

3435
04:16:52,746 --> 04:16:55,856
SAM: No, she's dead.

3436
04:16:55,856 --> 04:16:58,451
LIAM: No, shut up. I will kill you in the parking
lot.

3437
04:16:58,451 --> 04:17:00,757
MATT: We will pick this up in January.

3438
04:17:00,757 --> 04:17:05,315
TRAVIS: What was that called, those four flaming
rocks?

3439
04:17:05,315 --> 04:17:07,959
MATT: That's called Meteor Swarm. That's a
9th-level spell.

3440
04:17:07,959 --> 04:17:12,525
TRAVIS: Is that a spell? What level is that?

3441
04:17:12,525 --> 04:17:14,048
ALL: 9th-level.

3442
04:17:14,048 --> 04:17:18,697
LIAM: She just blew her wad, she's done, we got a
dragon and a flute.

3443
04:17:18,697 --> 04:17:20,134
LAURA: She's not done.

3444
04:17:20,134 --> 04:17:26,182
MATT: You're right. She has nothing else up her
sleeve. So. On that note.

3445
04:17:26,182 --> 04:17:27,884
SAM: Matt Mercer.

3446
04:17:27,884 --> 04:17:33,716
MATT: This could possibly be a whole different
encounter, I don't want to keep you guys here

3447
04:17:33,716 --> 04:17:36,727
until 1 AM. I know Laura has to record in the
morning.

3448
04:17:36,727 --> 04:17:39,144
LAURA: I do, I have to film all day.

3449
04:17:39,144 --> 04:17:41,504
SAM: I have an 8 AM session.

3450
04:17:41,504 --> 04:17:49,186
MATT: Well. Guys. This will be interesting.

3451
04:17:49,186 --> 04:17:51,095
(groaning)

3452
04:17:51,095 --> 04:17:54,001
MATT: Yeah, it's going to take a few rounds for
the rest of the party to get here.

3453
04:17:54,001 --> 04:17:55,594
TRAVIS: She didn't get to ask any of the
questions?

3454
04:17:55,594 --> 04:17:58,511
LAURA: She might not have even needed to ask
questions.

3455
04:17:58,511 --> 04:18:01,539
SAM: Of course she did, she cast a big spell to do
it!

3456
04:18:01,539 --> 04:18:03,504
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe she was doing it
telepathically.

3457
04:18:03,504 --> 04:18:05,452
SAM: What are you talking about? She read a
scroll!

3458
04:18:05,452 --> 04:18:09,199
LAURA: Maybe it was just taking his soul into
herself.

3459
04:18:09,199 --> 04:18:10,872
SAM: Information!

3460
04:18:10,872 --> 04:18:17,546
MATT: Regardless. (laugh) We are out for the
evening, thank you all for sticking with us for

3461
04:18:17,546 --> 04:18:19,256
this longer episode.

3462
04:18:19,256 --> 04:18:24,096
LIAM: We should have just let her do what she
wants, summon the most powerful thing in the

3463
04:18:24,096 --> 04:18:25,060
universe.

3464
04:18:25,060 --> 04:18:26,226
TRAVIS: I like that idea.

3465
04:18:26,226 --> 04:18:29,049
MARISHA: Team Rowdy Half-Elves, what's up!

3466
04:18:29,049 --> 04:18:33,041
MATT: Yeah, the half-elves are down here in this
chamber, with the Thordak eggs.

3467
04:18:33,041 --> 04:18:37,187
MARISHA: Half-elves, running in, recklessly, yeah!
Like we do!

3468
04:18:37,187 --> 04:18:41,608
TALIESIN: I've got nothin'. Yeah.

3469
04:18:41,608 --> 04:18:45,794
MATT: (laughs) Anyway, guys. Thank you so much for
watching, thank you guys for kicking ass in that

3470
04:18:45,794 --> 04:18:46,880
battle.

3471
04:18:46,880 --> 04:18:48,705
TRAVIS: Talks Machina next week?

3472
04:18:48,705 --> 04:18:51,261
MATT: Talks Machina on Tuesday. It's the Critmas
episode, check it out.

3473
04:18:51,261 --> 04:18:52,660
LAURA: Check out Backblaze.

3474
04:18:52,660 --> 04:19:06,473
MATT: Indeed, indeed. And I guess have a wonderful
New Year to all of you guys, very happy holidays

3475
04:19:06,473 --> 04:19:12,281
to everyone. All viewers, Critters, Team Hooman,
and everyone who decides to spend their Thursdays

3476
04:19:12,281 --> 04:19:16,983
with us. We really appreciate it. Love you very
much, and we'll see you in the new year. Is it

3477
04:19:16,983 --> 04:19:19,235
2017 yet?

3478
04:19:19,235 --> 04:26:39,622
