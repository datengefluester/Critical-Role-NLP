MATT: All right, let's do this.

00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:06,953
ZAC: They were all into dancing and the second we
went back live they were like, "Oh god no!"

00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:08,159
LAURA: I know, right?

5
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,792
MATT: The song is the preference.

6
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,933
LAURA: It's the song.

7
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,573
ZAC: It's got to be the right song. I understand.

8
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:13,952
ASHLEY: I think the DM might have to go first.

9
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:15,805
LAURA: Yeah, DM has to go first. He has to lead
the group.

10
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:25,963
ZAC: So somebody bought us Just Dance 2014 and it
came in today. What are you feeling?

00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:30,276
MATT: Ooh, how hard is the difficulty up at the
top?

12
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,065
ZAC: There's not really a difficulty.

13
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,481
MATT: I'm thinking Applause, maybe, it's a good
one.

14
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,847
ZAC: I bet it's hard. Gaga songs are hard, man.

15
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:43,197
MATT: Well then, we're going to start hard then,
aren't we? What other songs have we got? You

16

ASHLEY: What's Careless Whisper?

18
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:50,816
ZAC: I don't know, they want Ashley and I to do
Careless Whisper.

ZAC: Shit! Ashley bailed on Monday night's Honesty
Hour. You guys can give her shit about that on

467
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:00,365
Twitter.

468
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,411
ASHLEY: Sorry!

469
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:08,112
ZAC: Thank you guys for all the subs tonight.
We're still giving those away. We still have ten

470
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:14,001
of those to give away, so you'll be hearing us
pump that up tomorrow. And the following Monday,

471
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:23,523
Ashley's in, until she decides to do something
better and lets me know. Or anything else at all

472
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:31,401
is probably a better choice. All right. Lucas,
turn me off.

473
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:34,562
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Bye!
