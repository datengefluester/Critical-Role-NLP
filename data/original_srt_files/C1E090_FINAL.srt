1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:03,548
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,759
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Nice try,
motherfuckers.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,307
(all laugh)

4
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:14,133
MATT: Anyway, welcome to tonight's episode. Before
we get into it, we have some announcements to do

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:19,713
really fast. First and foremost, getting to our
fantastic sponsor for the evening. Returning: the

6
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:27,891
glorious Loot Crate! Thank you so much, Loot
Crate, for being fantastic and for being a sponsor

7
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,572
for our show as long as you have! It's been awesome!

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,096
SAM: Hi, guys!

9
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,039
MATT: Hi, Sam.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,242
SAM: Oh, you didn't throw it to me yet, did you?

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,042
MATT: No, but I can. Hey, Sam. Why don't you tell
us about our sponsor?

12
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:41,283
SAM: Hey, as I tell you guys-- Hey, crew. By the way, crew:
as I tell you guys about Loot Crate, can you guys

13
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:48,605
get a camera up here? I'm going to show some
close-up things. Should have done that ahead of

14
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:55,594
time. It's on its way. Okay. Loot Crate, the theme
this week is Primal. Brands include X-Men,

15
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:59,808
Overwatch, Predator, you can go to
lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code

16
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:06,139
CRITICALROLE for 10% off. And that's some severe
savings. Just a few days left to catch this

17
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:11,676
month's theme, so check it out. They're a great
sponsor; we love them. They do so much for the

18
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:16,922
show. We genuinely appreciate them. Okay, that
being said-- and this will tie into Loot Crate, I

19
00:01:16,922 --> 00:01:26,455
promise-- I was thinking a lot this week about fan
art. Are you on me? Whatever. Fan art.

20
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:28,133
MARISHA: Where did that camera come from?

21
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:33,862
SAM: They're fast. So, we have amazing fan artists
on this show. We get hundreds of art pieces every

22
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:39,111
week. We're floored by them constantly:
legitimately amazing artists. Talented, gifted.

23
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:44,209
And I was like, "why should they get all the fun?"
So I was like, "I'm going to do my own fan art

24
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:51,994
"this week!" Because things people know about me,
I'm a talented performer and all that stuff, but

25
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm also an emerging visual artist. And this is a
chance to get my art out to the world. And so I'm

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,041
going to present it right now. Guys, this is art,
so if you have any kind of a reaction that's real-- if

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,151
you cry, if you clap, whatever. I'll take it.

28
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,111
LIAM: Man. Joma, your time is over!

29
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:17,249
SAM: I'm going to start with Grog.

30
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,378
LAURA: So good!

31
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:19,374
SAM: It's pretty good!

32
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:20,645
LAURA: Did you really draw that?

33
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,507
MARISHA: Let me see over here! Is that you? Did
you do that?

34
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,680
SAM: Magic marker on paper.

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,686
MARISHA: That's actually pretty good, man!

36
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,644
LAURA: I like it!

37
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,812
SAM: I feel like I got his rage and his ferocity.

38
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,129
TALIESIN: I'm feeling it.

39
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:32,927
SAM: Next up, she's hard: Keyleth.

40
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,175
MARISHA: That's pretty good!

41
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:40,359
SAM: I did Keyleth. I should point out that all of
these are signed and numbered by the artist.

42
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,779
MARISHA: I have some fierce bone structure going.

43
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,366
SAM: You're hard. Lot of things going on.

44
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,970
MATT: I can see she's cast the 5th-level spell
"Body to Forest."

45
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,867
SAM: I didn't know how to draw bodies! So I just
went with grass!

46
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,628
LIAM: Druids don't shave pits, man.

47
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:05,241
SAM: Truth be told, I was drinking, so things get
a little worse as we go. So, this is Percy! It's a

48
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:10,114
lot of white. I don't know how to paint with white
or use white.

49
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:11,907
LIAM: To be fair, so is Percy.

50
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:20,736
SAM: He's a white guy with white hair. I've got to
work on this one. Next up, a guy who's near and

51
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:28,237
dear to me. Here's Taryon Darrington. Little art
tip here, guys: don't use blue pencil on blue

52
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:35,187
paper because it tends not to show up. That's a
free artist-to-artist tip for you guys.

53
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:39,432
TALIESIN: Wait, you need to turn it back this way
more. Oh, okay.

54
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,585
SAM: There is a drawing there.

55
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:42,683
TALIESIN: Bold decisions.

56
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:44,373
SAM: It's just blue pencil on blue paper.

57
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,795
MATT: It's like one of the Magic Eye pictures. You
have to really focus to see it.

58
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,185
TALIESIN: I see a sailboat.

59
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:53,474
SAM: And then I was like, "The people are going to
want Scanlan, right?" So this one took the most

60
00:03:53,474 --> 00:04:01,236
time. I will say this. Took about an hour. Mostly
because I had to go to CVS to get more magic

61
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:07,828
markers, so that was about 55 minutes of the time.
And then the rest was hardcore art. And I feel

62
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:11,078
like I really captured him. He's got a flute. He's
got poop.

63
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,104
MARISHA: I love that you broke rule number one of
Pictionary and labeled things!

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,242
SAM: Okay, I'm going to do the twins next.
Probably go a little wider because these will be

65
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:26,324
side-by-side, all right? So you can really get the
artistry. Okay, here they are.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,821
LAURA: Which one's which?

67
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,848
(all laugh)

68
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:36,367
SAM: Some may argue that I photocopied Vax and put
pink ribbons in her hair to be Vex. Some could

69
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:44,086
argue that, and they would be correct. But you can
also tell them apart because he's got a knife and

70
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,749
she's got a little bow and arrow.

71
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,635
TRAVIS: Are those arrows green?

72
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:54,372
SAM: I ran out of a lot of things, and I was
drinking pretty heavily at this point, so I was

73
00:04:54,548 --> 00:05:00,350
probably fully drunk at this point. And then last,
but not least. I mean, all together, I'd say

74
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:08,645
probably an hour and a half it took me to do all
these, including the CVS run. And last but not

75
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:12,793
least, I'm most proud of Pike Trickfoot, ladies
and gentlemen.

76
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:16,140
ALL: Whoa!

77
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,917
SAM: Now, again, you could say that I printed out
her IMDB page and colored it in, and you'd be

78
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:27,409
right, but it is also art, and I will stick by
that. Now here's how this all ties into Loot

79
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,200
Crate, guys.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,387
MATT: It tied into The Dark Knight in that
particular image.

81
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:37,249
SAM: I'm giving all of this art away tonight! I'm
doing a contest, an unsanctioned contest that I'm

82
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:43,248
running myself. So tonight, tweet me pictures of
your Loot Crate stuff, like you and your Loot

83
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:50,830
Crate shirt, or you holding a Loot Crate, or a
screengrab of "I just subscribed to Loot Crate!"

84
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,687
Tweet it to me with the hashtag
#BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage.

85
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,566
(all laugh)

86
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:02,644
SAM: And I will, like a lottery, pick one at
random to win all of this art signed by the

87
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:10,473
artist. One-of-a-kind pieces that will certainly
go up in value-- maybe even before I die! They

88
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:16,111
will be worth a lot of money. And these are all
going to a fabulous art collector out there. Thank

89
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,959
you, Loot Crate! Thank you, artists! And that's
it.

90
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,201
TALIESIN: What are you?

91
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:27,820
LIAM: Happy St. Pat's. That's the end of the episode, right?

92
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,382
SAM: You can pass them around. Share them, show
them.

93
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,715
MARISHA: When did you do these? Last night?

94
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,820
SAM: I think it was after you left my house last
night.

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,078
MARISHA: Are you serious? We left at midnight!

96
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:41,146
SAM: Yeah, it was eleven-something.

97
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:45,201
TALIESIN: Is it my imagination that all of the
half-elves kind of have the same

98
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,692
weird chin thing going on?

99
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,046
MATT: It's consistent!

100
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:50,047
SAM: Yeah!

101
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:54,901
TALIESIN: I will also say that I definitely get
Ashley as the Joker threatening the city.

102
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,151
SAM and MATT: Yeah.

103
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,141
TALIESIN: Millions will die.

104
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,195
MARISHA: Why the pink lipstick, man?

105
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,190
SAM: That's what girls wear!

106
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,247
MARISHA: Have you ever seen Ashley wear pink
lipstick?

107
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,791
SAM: Yep. Girls wear pink lipstick.

108
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,157
MARISHA: Although I appreciate her guns and her
biceps.

109
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,412
MATT: She's a monstah.

110
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,716
TALIESIN: She's like if The Joker had a daughter
with Krondor.

111
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:11,967
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

112
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:12,837
SAM: Sure, sure.

113
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:13,948
LAURA: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Loot Crate!

114
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:15,111
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate.

115
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,564
TALIESIN: What's that hashtag again?

116
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:18,631
SAM: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage

117
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:23,482
MATT: Okay, there we go. Remember that, guys. All
right, merch update. Same old, same old,

118
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,466
I'm pretty sure?

119
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,582
LAURA: Merch update! There's merch still in the
store!

120
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:29,737
MATT: Cool. You've got stickers, mugs, patches,
bracelets, stuff like that.

121
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,222
LAURA: All that stuff.

122
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:35,149
MATT: Logo shirts and the disturbingly comfortable
"How do you want to do this?" hoodies up there.

123
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,398
LAURA: It's true.

124
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:42,549
MATT: WonderCon! We're going to be at WonderCon
doing a live Talks Machina panel on Saturday,

125
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:51,432
April 1st from 2-3 PM Pacific at the arena at the
Anaheim Convention Center. The big room. So fill

126
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,809
it, Critters! Come on in! We have plenty of room
and space for you guys. We want to try to show the

127
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:55,895
convention that we are legion.

128
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,579
MARISHA: Not an April Fools' joke!

129
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,079
MATT: We're actually going to be there.

130
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,296
LAURA: This is legit.

131
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,516
LIAM: It is an April Fools' joke.

132
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,839
LAURA: No, it's not!

133
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,255
MATT: They gave us the big room and went, "You
can't fill this," and we're like, "Yeah, we can."

134
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:10,203
So we're trying to prove to them that we can fill
the room. Come and join us, 2-3 PM.

135
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:12,786
LIAM: Bring 4,000 of your closest friends.

136
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:17,807
MATT: Wednesday Club! Taliesin!

137
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:22,260
TALIESIN: Yes! I missed this week because I
realized, once again, that I'm supposed to be

138
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,074
doing things other than playing D&amp;D and actually
working in the real world. So I missed this

139
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,853
Wednesday Club, but I'll be back next week. I
don't actually know what the subject is yet

140
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,859
because I've done nothing other than this all
week.

141
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,230
SAM: Fantastic Four!

142
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,864
TALIESIN: Actually, probably not. We did Marvel
last week.

143
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,123
TRAVIS: Old Man Logan!

144
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:41,564
TALIESIN: Maybe. No Marvel this week! We've got to
let DC, and Image, and independent books

145
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,842
may give a thing.

146
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,613
TRAVIS: X-O Manowar!

147
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:48,799
TALIESIN: X-O Manowar? You are a nerd, dude, whoa!
Are you coming on?

148
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,931
MATT: How about just Manowar? The band.

149
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,363
TALIESIN: I was going to say, will you come on our
X-O Manowar show if we do one?

150
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:54,798
TRAVIS: I don't know, man. I like football.

151
00:08:54,798 --> 00:09:00,761
TALIESIN: Okay. I love you. So yeah, there will be
a Wednesday Club. Check out Twitter for updates,

152
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:05,212
but I'll be back and it will be fun, and I'll be
catching up on all my books.

153
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:18,343
MATT: Awesome. Next up, we have debuting on, I
believe it's Sunday. This Sunday, March 19th, on

154
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:24,720
Alpha we have Roundtable. Which is, essentially, a
series where a bunch of various storytellers get

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,956
together and talk about different themes about
storytelling over drinks. It's actually pretty

156
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:35,890
badass. This first season is Gamemasters. We have
a collection of talented people from all over the

157
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,863
webisphere running games.

158
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,665
MARISHA: We went international!

159
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:44,398
MATT: Heck yeah. This first episode premieres
Sunday. It's a conversation between me, Mark Humes

160
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:50,672
of High Rollers, and Adam Koebel of Roll Play. So,
if you want to check it out, it's on

161
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,070
projectalpha.com.

162
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,715
MARISHA: Pro-JECT Alpha.

163
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,018
MATT: Pro-JECT Alpha.

164
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:58,044
MARISHA: Pro-JECT that Alpha.

165
00:09:58,044 --> 00:10:02,899
MATT: It actually was a really awesome
conversation. I'm pretty happy about it. We got a

166
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:10,092
little tipsy. GM Tips episode went up today! It is
my final run on GM Tips, but the series continues

167
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:15,119
as I pass it off to a new host. If you haven't
checked it out yet, our fantastic Satine Phoenix

168
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:21,373
is picking up the torch to give her perspective as
a game master for this next bit. She's awesome.

169
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:28,538
This episode is specifically about how to avoid or
deal with GM burnout, which is a topic that I

170
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,737
think a lot of people are familiar with.

171
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:32,331
LIAM: You don't have that, do you?

172
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,635
MATT: Huh? Not yet.

173
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:35,513
TRAVIS: They make pharmaceuticals for that.

174
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:39,667
MATT: None. (laughs) Hopefully. No, but honestly,
it's got some good tips for anyone out there who

175
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:43,303
is feeling like they're starting to run a little
ragged or a little sluggish. Check it out. Hope

176
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:46,988
you like it. Signal Boost
episode.

177
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:54,489
MARISHA: Featuring Satine! Which we timed out
pretty well. I think intentionally.

178
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,203
TALIESIN: Maybe. Probably not.

179
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,466
MARISHA: I'm not sure.

180
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,082
MATT: Nothing that works out well is intentional
in our sphere.

181
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:03,289
MARISHA: Totally intentionally. So if you don't
know who Satine is, get introduced to her with

182
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:09,135
this week's episode of Signal Boost, and then
she'll lead you graciously into GM Tips.

183
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,976
TALIESIN: It's the gothiest one since me, I think.
Well, no, Jason Charles is pretty gothy.

184
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:17,194
MARISHA: She's awesome. I have kind of a girl
crush on Satine. She's so cool.

185
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,356
TALIESIN: She's so cool.

186
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,216
MARISHA: Yeah, you should go watch her.

187
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:23,599
LAURA: Thanks, Matthew Mercer!

188
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,319
MATT: You're welcome. Updated Trinket stats.

189
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:28,397
LAURA: (singsong) New Trinket stats!

190
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:33,648
LIAM: He's got guns attached now! Gatling gun!

191
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:37,001
LAURA: Yep, and a cannon.

192
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:37,911
MATT: Misfire score: 20.

193
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,025
LIAM: It shoots bees!

194
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:40,900
MATT: Yeah, and they all attack Trinket. It's bad.
You don't want to use it.

195
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,060
(all laugh)

196
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,934
MATT: (explosion noise) Right back into him. (bear
grunting) Yes, and last but not least, Talks

197
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:54,316
Machina live on Tuesdays, 7 PM, here on Twitch and
Alpha. Brian Foster hosts every week. We talk

198
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:57,998
about random shit about this, have guests from the
community on-- check it out. It's a good time.

199
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,391
MARISHA: And apparently he smells like cabbage.

200
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,565
MATT: Apparently, hashtag.

201
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:04,313
SAM: Getting a lot of great tweets already.

202
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,900
MATT: All right! That's the last of my
announcements.

203
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,788
SAM: Are we doing the other thing?

204
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:14,291
MATT: Oh, that's right! I'm sorry! The Critical
Role Fan Club on Facebook actually had a limerick

205
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:24,722
contest to announce their 10,000th person joining
it. And we had a winner. The winner is Tamiko L.

206
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:27,822
Fujio. Sam, do you have a copy of the limerick?

207
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:29,753
SAM: I have a copy of the limerick in my inbox,
right here.

208
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,316
MATT: I think you should read it off.

209
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:35,042
SAM: I'm going to read this limerick. They had
their own internal contest, and this was the

210
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,437
winner, and it's really awesome.

211
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:41,874
Vox Machina is a fine troupe 
Who knock baddies and grannies for a loop

212
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:46,560
Unless they encounter a door 
Then their plans are no more

213
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,406
So instead they'll just scry with their poop.

214
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,528
(all cheer and laugh)

215
00:12:52,528 --> 00:13:02,534
MATT: Congratulations, Tamiko. That was awesome!
Well done. And everyone leveled. Everyone's at 17

216
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,073
except for Tary, who's at 14. Congratulations.

217
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,267
TRAVIS: Fucking dingleberry.

218
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,762
MARISHA: (sings) 9th-level spells!

219
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:11,576
LAURA: That Scanlan could've gotten.

220
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:12,516
MARISHA: Yeah.

221
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,504
(all laugh)

222
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:18,965
MATT: Anyway, let's go ahead and bring it into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

223
00:13:18,965 --> 00:14:51,498
[opening credits]

224
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:59,166
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'll
remember that. Taryon apparently exploded.

225
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,941
TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened.

226
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,256
MATT: Oh! There he is! Good job! (laughs) It's
like you rushed here from work.

227
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:06,239
SAM: (whispers) Sorry!

228
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,173
MATT: That's okay. So. Bringing us into tonight's
episode: Vox Machina, having completed the

229
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:16,673
toppling and destruction of the Chroma Conclave,
have now gone towards tying up the loose ends at

230
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:22,784
the end of this massive journey that involved
coming to the final stage of Keyleth's Aramente to

231
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:30,263
prove to her people, the Ashari, that she is the
proper next leader of the Zephra Air Ashari.

232
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:36,062
You traveled far west across the Ozmit Sea after
renting passage across a ship helmed by Captain

233
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:42,736
Adela, and made your way to the island city of
Vesrah, where you encountered Uvenda, Heart of the

234
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:46,495
Tides, the leader of the Water Ashari, and put
upon your final trial. You were sent into the

235
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:56,907
subocean Aerie of Torrent where you were to
retrieve lodestones in the constant threat of a

236
00:15:56,907 --> 00:16:01,587
kraken in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the kraken
was triggered upon your attempt. A massive battle

237
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:07,143
took place, one that claimed the life of
Vax'ildan, and barely escaped with a success under

238
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:12,335
your belt. You managed to bring his body back to
the central temple at the top of Vesrah, and

239
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:17,910
through bringing Pike's essence by a blessing
through Sarenrae, complete a resurrection ritual

240
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:26,955
that succeeded. Vax returns on his ever-dwindling
borrowed time from the Raven Queen, it seems,

241
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:35,806
thrusting himself into danger, but returns
nonetheless. After this, you guys got some

242
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:47,252
pictures drawn by Doty, as Pike intimidated him
into learning your names in a wonderful method.

243
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:54,972
You got passage on the ship back to Emon, where
you have made your way back to Greyskull Keep. And

244
00:16:54,972 --> 00:17:00,688
that was where we left off, as you plan for the
next leg of your venture.

245
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:14,080
So. Picking up from there: as an evening rest
comes to you all, a night of sleep. Vax, you have

246
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:24,585
a difficult evening, tossing and turning in bed,
the general ramifications of recent events

247
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,319
surrounding you. Which, as a note, as a person
who's back from resurrection, you are at a

248
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,808
relative penalty for the next few days. I don't
know if you were aware of that.

249
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:36,816
Were you aware of that?

250
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,115
TRAVIS: He is now.

251
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:40,149
LIAM: I kind of remember people going through
that.

252
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:45,435
MATT: Yep, so you have a night's rest after this,
so that's-- actually, no. You traveled on a boat

253
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:49,043
for a few days. That would have gone away! That's
right, because you had to make a whole journey

254
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:51,823
back to Emon, so you've rested up heavily in the
boat. Forget I said anything.

255
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:01,310
MATT: But, tossing and turning as the night
eventually takes you into subconsciousness, you

256
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:11,804
are plagued with flashes of deep-sea darkness.
Lashing tendrils. The ever-gaping maw, a beak

257
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:21,432
swallowing you. The light fading. And there once
again, you see emerging from the darkness the same

258
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:29,389
expressionless, solid porcelain mask of the Raven
Queen. The voice, omnipresent but gentle,

259
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:39,153
strangely warming against the cold of nothing. And
the voice just calls out, "I've given you back, my

260
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:49,796
"champion. But you are still mine. You have a
purpose. Do not forget."

261
00:18:54,387 --> 00:19:12,289
LIAM: You know well that my heart lies with them.
Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith

262
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:20,348
in you. And I await your word.

263
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:47,102
MATT: "And wait you shall. I sense something on
the horizon. I sense rousing villainy. I sense

264
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:59,057
"twisting the threads of life, but it is too far
beyond my vision. Only time will tell. But I've

265
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:08,554
"watched your thread. And it leads to something
bright; it leads to something great. But your

266
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:15,521
"thread is still clouded at that point. I cannot
see beyond. And as that thread moves, it gathers

267
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:28,863
"many around it: those you've come to love. Perhaps
their fate is tied with yours. Is that a

268
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:46,242
"responsibility you can bear, Vax'ildan? Then be
patient. Enjoy the time you have. For when this

269
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:57,580
"rousing evil gathers, I will need your full
attention, my champion." The mask recedes back

270
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:05,404
into the darkness, the cold overtakes you, and
suddenly you find yourself shooting up in bed,

271
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:10,026
gasping for breath. Sweat pours down your face
just as a gentle bit of light begins to break over

272
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:12,337
the sun coming through the window into the
bedroom.

273
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,609
Keyleth, you are roused out of your slumber as
well, hearing him gasp and breathe heavily,

274
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,056
leaning off the side of the bed.

275
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:26,665
MARISHA: You okay?

276
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:32,199
LIAM: Yeah. (coughs)

277
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,665
MARISHA: Did you have a nightmare?

278
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,142
LIAM: Yeah.

279
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,801
MARISHA: I have them, too.

280
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,164
LIAM: I know.

281
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,907
MARISHA: Do you want to talk about it?

282
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,463
LIAM: Eventually.

283
00:21:54,463 --> 00:22:00,791
MARISHA: Okay. Do you need anything?

284
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:06,184
LIAM: I've everything I need.

285
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:16,637
MARISHA: I do a little bit of Druidcraft,
something like lightning bugs in the room, and

286
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:24,219
make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to
get back to sleep.

287
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,388
MATT: Okay. You get--

288
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,903
LIAM: We get an extra hour.

289
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,996
MATT: You guys curl up to get back to sleep, and
as you do and the darkness takes you once more,

290
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:39,544
you hear the faint echoing whisper in the back of
your head as you fall back into your dreams, and

291
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:43,053
it says, "My fate-touched."

292
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:50,743
Now, the rest of you wake up the next morning.
It's been a while since you've been back in

293
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:57,932
Greyskull Keep, and it is strangely heartening to
be back at home without another constant threat of

294
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:04,868
death, without the looming of dragon destruction.
And it brings back a flood of memories of when you

295
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:12,285
first had this keep made, the innocence of those
days and the things you've learned since, and the

296
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:17,653
new appreciations you've gained through the struggles
you've had in the process. The other thing catches

297
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,513
you is the smell of fresh breakfast being
made downstairs,

298
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:22,796
as Laina apparently is already on task.

299
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:24,170
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

300
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,005
(all laugh)

301
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,655
LAURA: I'll run downstairs. Can't miss that.

302
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:40,279
MARISHA: As I wake up, before we head downstairs,
I grab Vax. Did you get back to sleep?

303
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,864
Are you all right?

304
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:46,147
LIAM: Yes. You ready for the day?

305
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:52,962
MARISHA: Never? Always. Yeah. No. Sure, let's go!

306
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:54,508
LIAM: You're a born leader. Come on.

307
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,596
MARISHA: Thanks.

308
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,602
MATT: You guys come down for breakfast. Laina is
currently rushing around, seemingly excited at the

309
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:09,750
prospect of being back in her kitchen, which has
been outfitted partially. When she returned, as

310
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:12,420
you know, most everything was stolen from the
keep, and it looks like she's made a few trips

311
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,396
into town and has purchased enough to make it
functional. She comes out and she starts bringing

312
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:28,009
meals; she has large piles of plates. "I'm really
quite sorry, but we don't have enough plates for

313
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:32,120
"everyone, so if you don't mind sharing for now--
We'll go do some purchases."

314
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,851
LAURA: I start grabbing bacon from the big piles.

315
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:37,418
MARISHA: Yeah, same. Communal style.

316
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:39,453
MATT: "Good. Well, I hope it's okay."

317
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:40,633
LAURA: It's perfect.

318
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,859
TALIESIN: Oh, good. Plates. I'll have a plate.

319
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:45,456
SAM: I'll take one as well.

320
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:49,913
LIAM: I reach in front of the boys and grab a big
fistful.

321
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:53,994
MARISHA: Half-elves are just, (gnawing noises).

322
00:24:54,241 --> 00:25:11,238
MATT: As you guys are eating you hear some heavy
footfalls coming from around the corner. The first

323
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:20,589
thing you notice is a familiar female face.
Once-short red hair has now grown quite long, or

324
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:27,534
at least grown longer to about ear-, chin-length.
You see Shayne Tranter, one of the guards that you

325
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:34,851
originally hired and then moved over to Whitestone
to guard, walk in, leather armor on, big pack over

326
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:39,058
her shoulder, looks like she's also returned. As she
comes in, she throws her pack down--

327
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:40,460
MARISHA: Dwarf, right?

328
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,404
MATT: Human. Human female.

329
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:44,656
MARISHA: Wrong note. Shayne Tranter?

330
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:54,793
MATT: Shayne Tranter, yeah. She walks in and
throws her pack down. "Ah, good morning! Glad to

331
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:59,084
"see you're all mostly alive."

332
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,681
TRAVIS: Did you eat already?

333
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,643
MATT: "No, is there food?"

334
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,445
TRAVIS: Too bad, no.

335
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,671
LAURA: Help yourself.

336
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:06,304
TALIESIN: Grog, please, there is food.

337
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:07,522
SAM: But no plates.

338
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,418
TALIESIN: But no plates.

339
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,906
MATT: "And you are?"

340
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:17,424
SAM: Oh, hi there! Just here for a visit. Taryon
Darrington. You haven't heard of me yet, but you

341
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:22,095
will. Do you work here? Are you one of our
employees?

342
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:25,317
MATT: "I'm one of their employees, yes."

343
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,787
SAM: Oh, well. They made me an official member
now, so.

344
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,575
MATT: "Great, so you'll be the one that pays me,
then."

345
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,829
LAURA: Oh!

346
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:39,001
SAM: We will all chip in for whatever your monthly
wages will be.

347
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:47,096
MATT: "Unless I'm mistaken, and-- well, unless you
canceled our contract. Mind you, we haven't been

348
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,833
"guarding the keep for a long time, so I'm not
going charge you for the time over that, we

349
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:52,554
"appreciate you on that, but we are back on the
clock,

350
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,312
"and this is kind of my only job at the 
moment, so--"

351
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,724
LAURA: Start guarding.

352
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:01,235
MATT: "All right." And she smiles and sits down,
and she grabs a little bit of food and pulls it

353
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:06,297
off into her hand and starts eating off her
leather gauntleted glove.

354
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:10,099
LAURA: Taryon, you don't have to worry about
paying on this.

355
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:12,258
SAM: How much do they cost?

356
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:13,770
TALIESIN: A fortune.

357
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,682
LAURA: I'm sure I have it written down somewhere.

358
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,512
(all laugh)

359
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,198
TALIESIN: We have books, there were books, we kept
books.

360
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:21,918
LAURA: Yeah, there were books! There was also a
dragon attack.

361
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:28,677
SAM: I fully expect to be treated as a full,
paying member of this and I will gladly contribute

362
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:30,864
one-seventh of the salary.

363
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:33,130
LAURA: Really not necessary.

364
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,693
TALIESIN: It's quite all right.

365
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:39,307
SAM: I insist. It's literally nothing to me.

366
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,631
(all laugh)

367
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:44,857
TRAVIS: Someone should teach him the Vox Machina
fight song, then.

368
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:45,877
LAURA: You should do it, Grog.

369
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:48,314
LIAM: Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of
all of us.

370
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:50,625
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you know the fight song?

371
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:56,657
SAM: No, no, I've not learned any fight song. Most
of the songs that I've learned are either

372
00:27:56,657 --> 00:28:03,536
religious in nature or I've read them in books and
I've made up my own melodies to them. They were

373
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:08,839
epic poems of yesteryear, and I sort of set them
to a little melody, mostly happy--

374
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,554
TRAVIS: You made up songs, then?

375
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:11,410
SAM: Well, I--

376
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,853
TRAVIS: No, that's good. Each one of these songs is,
like, personal, to the member, right? So you make

377
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:19,768
up a song about what Vox Machina means to you.

378
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:21,132
SAM: I do that?

379
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,247
TRAVIS: Yeah.

380
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:23,368
SAM: Wow.

381
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,933
TRAVIS: We'll need it by sundown tomorrow.

382
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:30,518
SAM: Doty, we have some work to do! Working
breakfast.

383
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:35,251
MATT: Doty sits down right next to you.

384
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:44,372
SAM: Machina, Machina. "Sock in a." Put a sock in
a-- no. Vox, Vox. Put it in the box.

385
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,573
We'll work on this.

386
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:54,707
LAURA: I'm scouring my notes for where I wrote
their salaries down.

387
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:55,943
TALIESIN: That was a long time ago.

388
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,073
LAURA: It was, but I've got my spiral here.

389
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:07,810
SAM: They're 100 gold a month for five of them,
and then 50 gold a month for the other two. That's

390
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,989
Vex's memory.

391
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:13,655
LAURA: That's my memory! 100 gold a month for each
of the guards, and then what was the extra?

392
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:17,298
SAM: Five of them get 100 gold a month and two of
them get 50 gold a month. I don't remember why or

393
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:21,077
who, but that's how-- I think the guards get 100
and the cooks get 50, or something?

394
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:23,529
MATT: Servants get 50, yeah.

395
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,813
MARISHA: See, as I wrote down, I believe Shayne,
Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick,

396
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:29,230
and Nitebe get 100 a month.

397
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,684
LAURA: And then we always gave Jarett a bonus
because he was captain.

398
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:34,914
MARISHA: Yeah. And because he was hot.

399
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:40,050
MATT: Yeah. Well. There you go. Although Jarett is
technically not on your payroll anymore. Jarett's

400
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,267
now a member of the Pale Guard in Whitestone.

401
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,050
LAURA: Yeah, I remember.

402
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,386
MARISHA: That's right. So, reducing our costs.
We're getting better at this.

403
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:54,323
LAURA: Do you know where the rest of the crew is,
Shayne?

404
00:29:56,814 --> 00:30:03,282
MATT: "Kendrick is currently watching up on the
wall. Nitebe, I haven't seen since you sent him

405
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:04,977
"off to Wildmount."

406
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,934
LAURA: Right.

407
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:12,767
MATT: And she gets a distant stare for a second
and says,

408
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:19,280
"Well, Cordell didn't make it through the ordeal."

409
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:21,244
TALIESIN: Really?

410
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:26,808
MATT: You can see her kind of-- she has that
look of somebody who lost a close friend. She gets

411
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:32,478
a distant stare for a second, clenches her jaw,
and then shakes her head

412
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:35,581
and goes back to eating absentmindedly.

413
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:41,413
MARISHA: We should have some sort of service,
then, or at least a dinner in Cordell's honor.

414
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:45,137
MATT: "That's up to you. I've already had mine. My
piece has been said."

415
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,738
LAURA: Well, we're glad to have you back.

416
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,758
MATT: "Me, too."

417
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,093
TALIESIN: Glad so many of us survived.

418
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,243
MATT: "Not everyone."

419
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:55,450
LAURA: Do any of us remember why Nitebe went to
Wildmount?

420
00:30:57,211 --> 00:31:01,828
MATT: You sent him a long time ago to look for
information about the Briarwoods.

421
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,258
TALIESIN: Oh no!

422
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:05,165
LAURA: Oh no!

423
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:07,601
TRAVIS: We made him a snack!

424
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,471
LAURA: We did?

425
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:11,215
TRAVIS: He turned into a Hot Pocket, y'all!

426
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:14,121
TALIESIN: Did we fight his undead body in the
crypt? Is that-- oh.

427
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:18,692
MATT: You have not crossed his path.

428
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:21,513
LAURA: Oh no, we killed our guard?

429
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,449
MATT: You haven't heard anything from him in a
long time.

430
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:27,107
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Vox Machina, not returning
your calls since 1992.

431
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:34,536
MATT: To be fair, spies, by nature, live a very
dangerous lifestyle that they accept. Who knows

432
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:37,371
what his whereabouts are or if he'll ever show up
again, but you haven't heard from him.

433
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,983
LAURA: Maybe he just took our money and ran?

434
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,179
MATT: It's also very possible.

435
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:42,019
LAURA: I doubt it, though.

436
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:43,655
TALIESIN: I would feel better about that, but
probably not.

437
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:45,111
MARISHA: I can try and scry.

438
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:49,475
TALIESIN: I just like the notion that maybe if we
just checked one more of those cells in the

439
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,244
dungeon of Whitestone--

440
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,249
MARISHA: Want me to scry on Nitebe? I can.

441
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:59,813
TALIESIN: You know, I'll say just because I'm
curious where this particular rabbit hole leads--

442
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:00,873
TRAVIS: Really?

443
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:01,634
LAURA: Maybe.

444
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:03,056
TALIESIN: It's not like we're going to go
wherever--

445
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,623
TRAVIS: We're just eating breakfast. Go for it!

446
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,930
LAURA: Yeah, just scry while we're eating
breakfast.

447
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,583
MARISHA: All right. I scry on Nitebe.

448
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,350
LIAM: I like that this is our breakfast
entertainment.

449
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,912
TALIESIN: This is our version of looking at our
phones. This is Vox Machina going--

450
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:17,933
LAURA: What do you see? Has he posted anything on
Facebook lately?

451
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:22,609
TRAVIS: Have we figured out how to project this on
a 55-inch flat wall monitor for us yet?

452
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,538
MARISHA: Actually, good question!

453
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:27,710
TALIESIN: Yes, but the frame rate is only 120
frames per second.

454
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,294
MARISHA: Yeah, it's only in black and white.

455
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:35,024
LIAM: He posted on Instagram six weeks ago
and that was it.

456
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:37,044
MATT: All right. So, are you doing Scry on
Nitebe?

457
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,390
MARISHA: Yeah.

458
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,895
LAURA: What do your scrying eyes see, Keyleth?

459
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:44,819
MATT: So as you eat your breakfast, you take a
moment. You finish the small ritual on the center

460
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:54,947
of the cold stone floor of your mess hall area of
the keep. You focus on your fuzzy but decent

461
00:32:54,947 --> 00:33:03,453
enough memory of Nitebe. As the ritual completes,
your vision focuses out for a second and then

462
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:09,088
returns to you. There's no focus. There's no
Nitebe.

463
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,930
LAURA: Oh no!

464
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,816
TRAVIS: He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of
Craven Edge!

465
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:17,609
TALIESIN: What?

466
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:20,797
MARISHA: I'm afraid the insane things that Grog
just said is correct.

467
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,754
TRAVIS: I am a powerful magician.

468
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:25,751
MARISHA: Yes.

469
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,930
LIAM: A happy ranch hand in the--

470
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,694
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's on the farm! He's running
through the fields of the farm, happy as can be.

471
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:38,912
All the room to run he wants! (laughs)

472
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,710
LAURA: This is actually very terrible.

473
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,795
TALIESIN: This is really sad in the weirdest way.

474
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,924
TRAVIS: I mean, yes. This is very dark, dark
time.

475
00:33:44,924 --> 00:33:47,040
LAURA: That's terrible.

476
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,503
MARISHA: Travis!

477
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:49,812
TALIESIN: I know. I can't.

478
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:53,976
LIAM: We're laughing at ourselves. We haven't
thought of this guy in 72 years!

479
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:56,359
TALIESIN: Pre-stream! It's been since pre-stream
that this has come up.

480
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,425
LIAM: Yeah.

481
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:58,915
TALIESIN: Okay. Wow.

482
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,911
LAURA: Well.

483
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:03,739
TRAVIS: Zero focus. Nothing.

484
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,874
MATT: There's no creature to receive the scrying
spell.

485
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,686
LIAM: My breakfast is not tasting as good.

486
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:13,678
MATT: Which means he's either on another plane of
existence... or he's fucking dead!

487
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:17,161
(all laugh)

488
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:21,369
TALIESIN: Is that this version of "He's in the
Feywild. Everything's fine right now."

489
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,792
MATT: You sent him to the great spy farm upstate.

490
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,978
MARISHA: Whatever timeline you believe in.

491
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,688
LAURA: At least we've avenged him, in a way.

492
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:32,982
SAM: Did he have a family? What was his mother's
name?

493
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:36,259
(all laugh)

494
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:40,772
SAM: Because we might want to send her a gift or
some sort of a tribute in coin.

495
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:46,483
LAURA: Yeah, I'll get right on that. Yeah.

496
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,930
MARISHA: There's got to be public record, right?

497
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:56,591
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. Anywho. We're down a few
servants, we should probably get some more guards.

498
00:34:56,591 --> 00:35:00,126
Hey, Shayne, do you have anyone you'd recommend?

499
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,366
MATT: "Honestly, me and Cordell worked as a team
for a long time. We didn't really make friends. I

500
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,920
"can go looking in the city for you?"

501
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,046
TRAVIS: No.

502
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,106
LAURA: That's all right.

503
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:13,262
TALIESIN: Keep your eyes open. We trust your
judgment.

504
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:19,577
MATT: "Unless you want to go look for yourself? I
don't mind going and finding some good candidates."

505
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:20,983
LAURA: Find a few more?

506
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:21,870
MATT: "Yeah."

507
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,932
MARISHA: I feel like the city is pretty
overwhelmed at the moment, though.

508
00:35:26,505 --> 00:35:27,888
MATT: "Up to you."

509
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:31,190
LAURA: A lot of keeps have been ruined. Guards
might be looking for work, actually.

510
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,569
MATT: "Yeah. People looking for work right now.
You look like you've got more important things to

511
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:40,250
"focus on, so if you want to hire some guards and
you have trust in me, throw me some cash and I can

512
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,813
"probably bring some people in."

513
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:45,545
MARISHA: How do you feel about your workload? Do
you feel like you can handle this?

514
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:52,883
MATT: "I can handle it." She shakes the bit of
scrambled eggs from her gauntleted hand.

515
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:54,798
LAURA: Good leading. Good leading, Keyleth.

516
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:59,618
TRAVIS: How's your keep bandwidth right now? Is
your plate full?

517
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:04,411
LAURA: This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and
make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like

518
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,529
she's trustworthy, but--

519
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,431
MATT: Totally.

520
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,000
LAURA: I rolled poorly for my insight--

521
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,611
MATT: What did you roll? Even if you roll poorly,
with the bonuses.

522
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,175
LAURA: 13?

523
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,299
MATT: 13. She seems pretty straight.

524
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:21,413
LAURA: All right.

525
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,929
MATT: She's straight with you. She's not trying to
layer it at all.

526
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:27,812
TALIESIN: We've got a trip to take, so perhaps
when we get back, we can audition some new

527
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:32,242
candidates. That'll be fun. You'll enjoy that.

528
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:36,370
SAM: Yes! I would enjoy anything.

529
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,276
TALIESIN: Oh, it's quite fun. It's quite nice.

530
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:41,429
SAM: I love me some fun.

531
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,015
TRAVIS: Are you going to audition these new guards
like we did you?

532
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:47,494
MATT: "Oh, I can figure something out. Don't
worry."

533
00:36:47,494 --> 00:36:51,180
LAURA: I like it. Make sure they're trustworthy,
if we're not going to be around. And I hand her

534
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:59,115
500 gold for herself and for Kendrick.

535
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:00,215
MATT: Yes.

536
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,874
LAURA: And the three that you hire.

537
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:09,364
MATT: "All right. I'll get on it, then. I think I
should have some time to go into town and do this

538
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:15,752
"here within the afternoon." She grabs another roll
off the table and takes a bite of it.

539
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:20,853
"Glad to have you back." And she turns around 
and leaves the room.

540
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:21,608
TRAVIS: I like her.

541
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:22,463
LAURA: She's cool.

542
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:23,661
TRAVIS: Yep. Doesn't say too much.

543
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:25,819
TALIESIN: Now I remember why we hired her in the
first place.

544
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:30,783
TRAVIS: Because she fought well! She fought a
giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard. What are

545
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:33,181
we doing today?

546
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:39,178
MARISHA: Well, we talked about going to the Cobalt
Reserve to drop off this--

547
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:43,153
LAURA: To drop off the evil book and do a little
research on the Nine fucking Hells.

548
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,278
MARISHA: And then--

549
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:53,396
TALIESIN: We need to do a bit of shopping, but
then we do have-- you're not quite done, are you?

550
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:56,857
MARISHA: I mean, there's that.

551
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,425
TALIESIN: I'm putting it out there.

552
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,699
LIAM: Yeah, you up for it?

553
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:00,694
TRAVIS: What?

554
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,031
LAURA: She's got to get crowned.

555
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:05,212
TRAVIS: (laughs)

556
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:09,381
TALIESIN: Wow! I watched that work its way from
your ear all the way to your brain, there!

557
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:10,838
TRAVIS: You're going to get crowned? Really?

558
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,654
TALIESIN: It got lost on the way! It was amazing.

559
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:13,631
LAURA: Even larger antlers?

560
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:14,141
TRAVIS: Wow!

561
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:16,238
MARISHA: Yeah, it's weird. I don't know.

562
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:19,336
TRAVIS: Does it sit on your head, or on the
antlers?

563
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:22,458
TALIESIN: They decorate it, like a winter's
festival.

564
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,202
LIAM: They put antlers on the antlers.

565
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:27,727
MATT: You do actually know, though you've never
seen anyone wear it, because in the time that

566
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:36,308
you've been learning, there hasn't been a formal
Voice of the Tempest, it's not a crown. It's more

567
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:41,883
of a mantle. It's a ceremonial mantle.

568
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:44,569
LAURA: So you just hold it like a giant mantle?

569
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:50,453
MARISHA: Well, not like a fireplace mantle.
Although I could, technically, transform into a

570
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,125
fireplace now.

571
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,547
TRAVIS: Why?

572
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,580
MARISHA: Because I'm a badass.

573
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,942
LAURA: (gasps) You could turn into doors!

574
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,901
MARISHA: You know, I could, I'm pretty sure.

575
00:38:58,901 --> 00:38:59,885
MATT: Creature!

576
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,698
MARISHA: No, I could! Hang on, hang on!

577
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:03,561
LAURA: A mimic!

578
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:06,953
MARISHA: A mimic! Couldn't I turn into a mimic
that could be a door? Or a mantle?

579
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:10,719
MATT: Well, you haven't seen a door mimic before.
Because I don't hate you that much yet.

580
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,151
LIAM: We haven't seen a base mimic before.

581
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:12,837
LAURA: Yeah, we have!

582
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:13,253
LIAM: In this game?

583
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,492
MATT: You have seen a mimic, yeah.

584
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:15,382
LIAM: I don't remember it.

585
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:16,733
MATT: That was second session.

586
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:18,694
LIAM: Ooh, shizz-nap!

587
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:22,896
MATT: Yeah. That was second. A mimic and a
gelatinous cube in the same combat. I was like,

588
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:25,506
"Hi guys! Welcome to D&amp;D! (splat noise)"

589
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:26,959
LIAM: That I remember, yeah.

590
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,906
TALIESIN: Was I at that one?

591
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:30,771
MATT: No, you weren't at that one, unfortunately.
That was before you came back to the campaign.

592
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,692
MARISHA: Can I be a door?

593
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:39,066
LAURA: I think it's a no.

594
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,451
MATT: I'll look at Shapechange.

595
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:42,776
MARISHA: We'll think about it. Anyway.

596
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:43,882
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's just creatures.

597
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,894
MARISHA: It's fine.

598
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:48,337
LAURA: Okay! What are we fucking doing? What are
we doing?

599
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,961
MATT: It's "different creature." If you encounter
a door-shaped creature in the future, you can

600
00:39:51,961 --> 00:39:54,734
totally do that.

601
00:39:55,725 --> 00:40:00,571
TALIESIN: Please! I'm sure you're having all sorts
of reservations and thoughts and processes about

602
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:09,453
this notion, but I will admit, I have yet to
introduce your sister to the best part of being

603
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:19,524
titled, which is dressing up. And it would be a
coronation! We could get some clothes! We could

604
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:22,411
wear something lovely.

605
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:27,321
LIAM: Does that jive with your hometown, though,
Kiki? Dressing up?

606
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,315
MARISHA: Yeah.

607
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,919
TALIESIN: It's a sign of respect.

608
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,730
TRAVIS: Do all people with titles have to dress
up?

609
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,797
TALIESIN: Yes.

610
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:34,859
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

611
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,098
TALIESIN: I am.

612
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:39,126
MARISHA: We're very open-minded.

613
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:42,303
LAURA: Oh, Grand Poobah. I'm afraid you have to
wear something quite formal.

614
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:46,371
TRAVIS: You know what? Breakfast is disagreeing
with me. I think I have to go back to bed.

615
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:48,313
TALIESIN: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

616
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:52,304
TRAVIS: (gags) Yeah, I don't feel well. I've got
to go. I go back up to my room.

617
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:55,382
MATT: (laughs) Grog storms off.

618
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:57,997
LAURA: I really thought we were going to get him
to bathe this time.

619
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,056
MARISHA: Does he have an aversion to wearing
pants?

620
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:03,598
TALIESIN: I'm sure we can work out something
without pants.

621
00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:10,824
LAURA: (laughs) Just a belt. A really glorious
belt. Over the dwarven belt.

622
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:12,114
MARISHA: All blinged out.

623
00:41:12,114 --> 00:41:19,394
LIAM: It's like a kilt that's barely joined at the
bottom already. It's like a poopy diaper.

624
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:23,637
TALIESIN: Just get him boots that go all the way
up to the neck.

625
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,345
LIAM: It literally is a poopy diaper.

626
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:28,080
MATT: Poopy diaper of dwarvenkind.

627
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,708
LAURA: Gross!

628
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,151
TALIESIN: Activate number one or number two.

629
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:33,262
TRAVIS: Battle kilt.

630
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,830
LAURA: Seriously, though, what are we doing?

631
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:40,540
LIAM: Well, we're in town. We've got this book and
a library, but we should decide what we're going

632
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:47,191
to do tomorrow. What's to wait? Why don't we go
home?

633
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:59,048
MARISHA: (stammers) Well, it's just weird. It's
just weird. It's been so long. It's a lot of

634
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:01,618
build-up, and then it's going to be over.

635
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:04,171
LIAM: You are adorable right now.

636
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,737
MARISHA: I'm serious!

637
00:42:08,227 --> 00:42:12,338
LAURA: Maybe your dad will have information on the
Nine Hells.

638
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:19,816
MARISHA: He could, yeah. It's just, my whole life
has been building up to this, and if we complete

639
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:21,905
it, that makes it real.

640
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:27,662
LAURA: Wait, I do have a question, actually. If
you complete it, do they want you to stay?

641
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:33,647
MARISHA: If I complete it, then I am the Voice of
the Tempest. I imagine I can do whatever I want.

642
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,023
Right?

643
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:36,526
LAURA: Or you stay and lead your people.

644
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:39,553
LIAM: Yeah. Does the Tempest go on road trips?

645
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:45,450
MARISHA: I don't know.

646
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,735
LIAM: Oh.

647
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:49,421
TALIESIN: Has your life been leading up to this
moment, or has your life been leading up to

648
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:54,125
everything that happens after this moment?

649
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:59,056
MARISHA: I'm not entirely sure of the difference
of what you just said.

650
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:03,064
TALIESIN: I'm just saying, as somebody who spent
several years of their life avoiding the one thing

651
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:12,047
that would make them even remotely happy, maybe
just barreling through it is the way to go. We'll

652
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,728
be there!

653
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:19,265
MARISHA: I guess it is that notion of leading up
to this one moment that you've thought of for a

654
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:23,190
while. Once you complete that, what happens next?

655
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,517
LAURA: It's just like getting married, Keyleth.

656
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:27,119
MARISHA: Is it, though? Yeah?

657
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,514
LAURA: It's all the planning. That just freaks you
out, that's all.

658
00:43:30,514 --> 00:43:33,095
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

659
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:34,587
LIAM: What do you know about that?

660
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:37,337
TALIESIN: I was going to say, is that theoretical
or experiential?

661
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,251
LAURA: Theoretical, obviously!

662
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:40,174
TALIESIN: Okay. Just checking.

663
00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:44,939
LIAM: She does read a lot. Or she used to.

664
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:46,516
TALIESIN: She still reads a lot.

665
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:48,046
LAURA: I do! (laughs)

666
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:49,894
LIAM: Are you sharing a library?

667
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:50,781
TALIESIN: Lots of things.

668
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,708
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it.

669
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:56,831
TALIESIN: No, you don't. That's why I was so
excited that you pried.

670
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:07,097
MARISHA: It's whatever you guys think is best. We
can go to Westruun first, or we can go to Zephra

671
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,416
first. Just whatever you want.

672
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,660
LIAM: Oh, that's a big decision for you to make, I
think.

673
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,958
MARISHA: No, it's the difference of a day or two,
right?

674
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:22,121
MATT: You hear the heavy footfalls upstairs of
Grog's feet and a door slamming shut.

675
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,351
TALIESIN: He took his time.

676
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:29,321
MARISHA: Do we need an extra day to convince Grog
to wear pants? That could be the deciding factor!

677
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:31,732
Maybe we should put it on him. Right?

678
00:44:31,732 --> 00:44:32,480
LAURA: Keyleth!

679
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,133
MARISHA: What?

680
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:34,450
LAURA: Make a decision.

681
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,226
MARISHA: (groans)

682
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:41,091
LAURA: Leader. You're going to be a leader. Just
make a choice.

683
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:47,545
LIAM: Everybody else believes in you. Why
shouldn't you?

684
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:50,043
TALIESIN: Pencil or pen?

685
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:52,519
MARISHA: (laughs)

686
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:56,964
LAURA: I'm looking forward to buying a dress
either way.

687
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:02,003
MARISHA: Let's check in at Westruun. Drop off the
book.

688
00:45:02,003 --> 00:45:03,287
LAURA: And see how you feel.

689
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:05,996
MARISHA: We'll head from Westruun to Zephra.

690
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,520
LAURA: Good plan.

691
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,502
MARISHA: All right.

692
00:45:08,502 --> 00:45:09,922
TALIESIN: You're going to be very good at this.

693
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:11,954
MARISHA: Man! Decision-making is hard.

694
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:13,035
TALIESIN: I know.

695
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:14,029
MARISHA: So many choices.

696
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,344
LAURA: So wait. (valley girl voice) Would the
shops here be better to buy a dress than the

697
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:17,810
shops in Westruun?

698
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:18,939
TALIESIN: Wow!

699
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:22,736
MARISHA: Good question! Who's importing more?
Where's fashion week happening?

700
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:24,419
LIAM: They're both handicapped, aren't they?

701
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:27,076
LAURA: That's what I mean.

702
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:31,223
MATT: They've both been under some recent duress,
so it really could go either way. Emon is

703
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:35,057
definitely more of the cultural hub, especially
since it's such a huge port town. You get a lot

704
00:45:35,057 --> 00:45:40,850
more cultural influence from other continents and
heavier trade. Emon would probably have better

705
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:47,889
outfits. But Westruun-- which, Grog, you grew up
in, and you guys have spent some time in-- does

706
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:54,315
have its own textiles district. There are weddings
that happen there. They have other events where

707
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:55,586
they sell fine--

708
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,789
LIAM: What's Westruun like? Pittsburgh?

709
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,596
MATT: You could say, yeah.

710
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:01,728
TRAVIS: It's like Wisconsin.

711
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:04,353
TALIESIN: Okay, that's less disappointing.

712
00:46:04,353 --> 00:46:09,003
MATT: Emon's the New York. Westruun's the
Pittsburgh.

713
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:11,347
TALIESIN: Whitestone's the Boulder.

714
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:12,807
MATT: Kind of, yeah! (laughs)

715
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:13,876
TALIESIN: It's Boulder, Colorado.

716
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:14,676
LIAM: Yeah, I like it!

717
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:15,586
TALIESIN: There's nothing happening.

718
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:16,403
TRAVIS: Boulder, baby.

719
00:46:16,403 --> 00:46:17,401
LAURA: But it's beautiful.

720
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:21,612
MARISHA: If it's the Pittsburgh, then we should go
now, because everything closes at five.

721
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:27,109
LIAM: We could also Tree Stride to Vasselheim for
the fanciest of shopping.

722
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:29,896
If you want to go all-out.

723
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:36,379
TALIESIN: In theory, they'll have your crest on
file. That's one of those things, any dressmaker

724
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:40,925
would actually know how to assemble something
appropriate for any house

725
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:43,102
of any nobility that exists.

726
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:46,893
LAURA: You know what? Vasselheim will actually
know a little bit about Orcus and I bet the Nine

727
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:49,465
Hells, as well, being the god hub.

728
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:50,786
TALIESIN: Ooh, a work vacation.

729
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:54,663
MARISHA: We did mention if we wanted to drop off
the book at Westruun or Vasselheim--

730
00:46:54,663 --> 00:46:56,927
LAURA: We should go to Vasselheim!

731
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,144
MARISHA: Do we want to do that instead?

732
00:46:58,144 --> 00:46:59,438
LAURA: Decision's fucking made. Let's go.

733
00:46:59,438 --> 00:47:00,364
MARISHA: All right! Let's go to Vasselheim.

734
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:01,911
SAM: I've never been. That sounds great!

735
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:04,112
MARISHA: How far north have you been, Tary?

736
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,681
SAM: Quite far north. Right? I'm from the north?

737
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:09,301
MARISHA: You're from Wildmount, correct?

738
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:16,983
MATT: You're from Wildmount, which is-- as far as
you know, from where you grew up, Tal'Dorei is to

739
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:26,286
the southwest of where you grew up. Issylra, which
is where Vasselheim is,

740
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:30,959
and Othanzia is far to the east.

741
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:34,165
LIAM: First there was the dinosaurs.

742
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,637
SAM: But I lived in the north of that place.

743
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:44,485
MATT: You lived in the north of Wildmount. It's
pretty Siberian, you would consider it.

744
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:45,287
SAM: Yeah.

745
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:47,092
LIAM: I want to go to there.

746
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:49,922
SAM: I thrive in cold places. Is this such a
place?

747
00:47:49,922 --> 00:47:52,621
MARISHA: It is quite chilly.

748
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,080
TALIESIN: Not as cold as my home, but it'll do.

749
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,224
SAM: I have some excellent cold-weather robes in
my bag of holding that I would love to flaunt.

750
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:03,502
LAURA: Let's go.

751
00:48:03,502 --> 00:48:05,290
MARISHA: Let's go.

752
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,666
TALIESIN: We also probably need a few healing
potions and such, and we'll probably have better

753
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,049
luck somewhere else.

754
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:12,163
LAURA: Yeah.

755
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:14,128
TALIESIN: Yes!

756
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:16,460
MARISHA: Anything else we need to do before we
leave Emon?

757
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,855
SAM: They'll have potions and things there?

758
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,411
TALIESIN: We probably need to stock up a bit.

759
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,381
SAM: Yes. They'll have these things at
Vasselheim?

760
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:23,244
LAURA: Yeah.

761
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:24,062
SAM: Great.

762
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:27,040
TRAVIS: You don't just have some health potions in
your armor? You can't just plink one out of your

763
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,462
nutsack or something?

764
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:35,970
SAM: I'm going to reach onto my robe and pull out
a patch that produces four healing potions.

765
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:36,916
TRAVIS: What?!

766
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,109
MATT: There you go.

767
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:40,609
LAURA: Are they regular, or are they greater?

768
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:41,226
SAM: They're regular.

769
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:42,289
LAURA: Oh. All right.

770
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:43,096
TRAVIS: That's great!

771
00:48:43,096 --> 00:48:45,383
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

772
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:48,374
TRAVIS: Man! We should tear you apart limb from
limb and see what fucking shakes out!

773
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:49,707
SAM: Please don't.

774
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,437
LIAM: Does that regenerate and come back? Is it
one time only?

775
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:56,137
SAM: No, but I'll just buy another one if I run
out.

776
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:57,100
TRAVIS: Another robe?

777
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,777
SAM: Yeah.

778
00:48:57,777 --> 00:48:58,737
TRAVIS: Wow.

779
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:01,311
TALIESIN: It's like a four-pack of medieval
Five-Hour Energy drink.

780
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:04,328
MATT: Basically.

781
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:06,877
SAM: It's literally Monster Energy.

782
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,618
TALIESIN: That's like a 1st-level healing potion.

783
00:49:09,618 --> 00:49:14,954
MARISHA: Tary, Vasselheim does get a little bit--

784
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:16,504
LIAM: They don't like magic.

785
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:18,796
SAM: They don't like magic?

786
00:49:18,796 --> 00:49:19,988
LAURA: Arcane magic.

787
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:21,066
MARISHA: Arcane magic.

788
00:49:21,066 --> 00:49:25,341
SAM: I practice alchemic magic, mostly, so I'll be
okay. I think.

789
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:28,082
TALIESIN: You might want to keep a low profile.

790
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:37,300
MATT: Alchemical elements, yes. But a lot of your
spells and infusing everything is arcane-based.

791
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,461
And you have a giant arcane metal man following
you around.

792
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:44,525
SAM: Oh! Maybe I should disguise Doty in some
way.

793
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:46,242
MARISHA: Can you do that?

794
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:47,132
SAM: No.

795
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:49,101
(all laugh)

796
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,186
SAM: I can throw a cloth over him or--

797
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:54,148
LAURA: Make him look like he's just a big dude
wearing a robe with a hood over his head.

798
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:55,194
TALIESIN: Or a ghost.

799
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:56,953
SAM: Or a ghost! Is it Halloween?

800
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:59,070
MARISHA: I don't think so.

801
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,392
TALIESIN: It is sadly not Hallow's Eve. We can put
him in some armor or some

802
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:04,094
fake cloth of some sort.

803
00:50:04,094 --> 00:50:05,343
LAURA: Let's just put a robe over him.

804
00:50:05,343 --> 00:50:08,867
SAM: Could you and I craft something for him
before the journey, like a face mask of some sort

805
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:10,915
that makes him look like a brave warrior?

806
00:50:10,915 --> 00:50:17,267
LIAM: I mean, I am really good at disguises. I
haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but--

807
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,790
LAURA: Let him give it a go.

808
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,874
SAM: You can make disguises?

809
00:50:20,874 --> 00:50:24,443
LIAM: I can work with a little bit of nose putty,
and yeah, I can make a fake face for this guy.

810
00:50:24,443 --> 00:50:26,846
SAM: That I would love to see.

811
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:31,386
MATT: As best as you understand, it isn't like,
"Oh my god, there's some sort of magic source in

812
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:35,547
"Vasselhiem, arrest everyone involved." It's not
super illegal, it's just generally frowned upon

813
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:37,983
and calls suspicion.

814
00:50:37,983 --> 00:50:41,584
SAM: No, I want to pursue you making a mask for
Doty.

815
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:44,062
LIAM: So do I. I feel really rusty.

816
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:46,192
LAURA: I want to help him because I'm a rogue,
too.

817
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:50,173
TALIESIN: Well let's go full Cinderella on this.
Let's get all the mice involved.

818
00:50:50,234 --> 00:50:52,141
LIAM: What do we want this guy to look like?

819
00:50:52,141 --> 00:50:54,719
SAM: Well, I mean, there's no disguising the fact
that he's eight feet tall

820
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,228
and squeaks when he walks.

821
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:58,923
(all laugh)

822
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,824
LIAM: Should we turn him into a goliath, then?

823
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:05,170
SAM: I mean, are we going to do full body paint
for this?

824
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,967
LAURA: What if we just put a stealth cloak over
him or something?

825
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,500
LIAM: Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak?

826
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,966
LAURA: Yeah, then paint his-- yeah, I do.

827
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:15,229
TALIESIN: Let's make him look like a goliath that
wears a lot of robes

828
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:16,778
because he was horribly scarred.

829
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:18,274
LAURA: I start taking robes out.

830
00:51:18,274 --> 00:51:20,517
TALIESIN: Grog, how do you feel about this? I feel
like you have the look--

831
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:21,576
LAURA: Grog's upstairs.

832
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:24,034
TALIESIN: Oh, you're upstairs, you're not actually
here. Never mind.

833
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:25,977
MARISHA: He's upset about the notion of pants.

834
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:27,485
TALIESIN: I know.

835
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:31,016
SAM: Making him look like he is in a suit of armor
seems like a thing.

836
00:51:31,016 --> 00:51:35,768
TALIESIN: We could put him in a suit of armor.

837
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,409
SAM: He's already metal.

838
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:42,201
LAURA: Fine. I take all of the robes off. Do
whatever you want.

839
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:49,603
TALIESIN: Is Doty strong enough to wear a suit of
armor?

840
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:50,537
SAM: He's strong.

841
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:52,106
MATT: I mean, decorative.

842
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:53,414
TALIESIN: Yes, decorative.

843
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,374
MATT: Yeah. Doty is his own suit of armor.

844
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:56,351
LAURA: Why are we doing this?

845
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:57,281
TALIESIN: Because this is funny.

846
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,267
MATT: Because it's amazing.

847
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:00,451
TRAVIS: He's a giant automaton!

848
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,402
LAURA: Just wear a robe!

849
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:02,545
TALIESIN: I'm having a wonderful time.

850
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:05,934
SAM: I want Doty with a fake nose. That's all I
want.

851
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:07,089
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, do that!

852
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:08,598
TALIESIN: Groucho Marx nose and glasses.

853
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:10,036
(all laugh)

854
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:17,344
LIAM: I'm going to need your help because I'm not
used to working on robots. You can make some mesh

855
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:28,460
work, right? And we can get some clay, and some
spectacles like yours, but maybe shaded. Yeah?

856
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,385
TRAVIS: He's only got the one pair now.

857
00:52:30,385 --> 00:52:32,073
TALIESIN: We can make him a mask at the very
least.

858
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:32,529
LIAM: Yeah.

859
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:33,466
TALIESIN: All right.

860
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:35,291
LIAM: I have made masks for myself.

861
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:37,610
MARISHA: This is going to look ridiculous!

862
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,649
MATT: I'm so excited.

863
00:52:38,649 --> 00:52:42,361
MARISHA: Everyone's going to be like, that's a
robot wearing a mask!

864
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:46,659
TALIESIN: No, it's just a man with no arms, legs,
heads, limbs and chest.

865
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:48,045
LIAM: We don't have to, I mean--

866
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:49,299
TALIESIN: No, we're doing it.

867
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,799
SAM: Let's spend some time.

868
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:54,831
TALIESIN: Everyone else can get their little
run-around of Westruun done

869
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:56,498
while we sit making a robot.

870
00:52:56,498 --> 00:53:01,595
MATT: Okay. So, Vax, needing materials to prepare
such an elaborate--

871
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,023
LIAM: Hey, give me some money. I don't have any
money. I never have money.

872
00:53:04,023 --> 00:53:07,509
LAURA: You need money to go buy a stupid mask for
a stupid robot?

873
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:10,300
LIAM: This is the first time in this entire
goddamn campaign--

874
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,130
LAURA: No, it's not.

875
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:11,782
LIAM: Yes, it is.

876
00:53:11,782 --> 00:53:12,856
LAURA: No, it isn't.

877
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,946
LIAM: Give me some fucking money.

878
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:17,734
SAM: Or, I can give you money.

879
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:18,877
LIAM: I want her money.

880
00:53:18,877 --> 00:53:19,646
SAM: All right.

881
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:21,351
LIAM: Thanks.

882
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:23,651
TALIESIN: It is important for him to express
himself.

883
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:26,134
LAURA: I have passed out money lately, before, I
think.

884
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:32,033
LIAM: I throw myself off of things for this one,
she can't give me 50 gold pieces.

885
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:32,957
LAURA: Fine!

886
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:33,844
LIAM: Thank you.

887
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,524
LAURA: How about everybody gets a thousand gold.

888
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:38,033
LIAM: It's a party!

889
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:38,834
TRAVIS: Really?

890
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:40,790
LAURA: Yeah, everybody take a thousand gold.

891
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,385
SAM: Me too?

892
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,148
LAURA: Except for you.

893
00:53:42,148 --> 00:53:50,414
(all laugh)

894
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:51,181
LIAM: Hey, Matt?

895
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:51,704
MATT: Yeah?

896
00:53:51,704 --> 00:53:54,440
LIAM: Do I have this ability? I feel like I
remember it, but I'm looking through--

897
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,145
TRAVIS: You don't know?!

898
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:57,516
(all laugh)

899
00:53:57,516 --> 00:53:59,775
TALIESIN: Oh no!

900
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:06,565
MATT: I'm pretty sure you do! I think you have a
disguise kit. It's not an ability per se.

901
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:08,623
LIAM: I have Imposter, right?

902
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:09,595
MATT: Right, you have Imposter.

903
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:11,732
LIAM: That's me, can I use it on a robot?

904
00:54:11,732 --> 00:54:15,382
SAM: By the way, Liam, if you don't have this
ability, I want to see this even more.

905
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,684
LIAM: Oh, we're doing it.

906
00:54:17,684 --> 00:54:19,447
MARISHA: Just bluff your way through it.

907
00:54:19,447 --> 00:54:23,284
MATT: No, because Imposter is the ability to mimic
somebody else. It has nothing to do-- A disguise

908
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:25,178
kit is what you're using.

909
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,141
LIAM: And I've always had a disguise kit.

910
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:28,021
MATT: Correct.

911
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:30,773
LIAM: Because I did something back in the home
game, I did something.

912
00:54:30,773 --> 00:54:35,193
MATT: Yeah, you've done a couple of things. But
it's not an ability you have.

913
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:36,416
LIAM: No?

914
00:54:36,416 --> 00:54:39,464
MATT: Well, you do have an ability, but it's only
for you, it's not for Doty.

915
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:42,553
TALIESIN: You own a cardboard box with a bunch of
stuff.

916
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:45,662
MATT: So here's what we do. First and foremost,
you have to go to the town and gather supplies

917
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:49,318
because your disguise kit is designed for very
small prosthetics and things.

918
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:50,752
This is a large endeavor.

919
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:52,088
LIAM: This is five times that.

920
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,233
MATT: Yeah. So I'm going to need you to roll an
investigation check. This is your ability to go

921
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:58,472
around the town and find, through the midst of
chaos of Emon trying to repair itself, somebody

922
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,781
who can sell you the supplies necessary.

923
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:01,995
LIAM: Well, that is a 20.

924
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:03,052
TALIESIN: I need some clay.

925
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:03,822
MATT: A natural 20?

926
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:04,692
LIAM: No, not a natural 20.

927
00:55:04,692 --> 00:55:06,369
MATT: But a 20? That's still fine. All right, it
takes you--

928
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,871
TALIESIN: I gave him a list.

929
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:12,397
MATT: It takes you about three hours, round trip,
to go into the city, locate the location, and

930
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:17,071
purchase-- relatively inexpensive, comparatively,
about ten gold pieces for materials to do this.

931
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:24,959
Which is expensive for anyone who's just-- and a
lot of it is burlap material that's gone over with

932
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:31,128
a weatherproofing liquid, that when it solidifies,
it gives almost a rubbery texture. It's used for

933
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:36,408
carts that are traveling a long distance under bad
weather. And you figure that might resemble some

934
00:55:36,408 --> 00:55:45,377
sort of a skin-type texture at a distance. You
gather other elements to build a mask, to wrap

935
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:52,078
things in material, to block things that might
look metallic. So yeah, so you gather things that

936
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:57,669
might work in your favor. So as you collect this,
what are you guys working on?

937
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:59,079
SAM: We're making a mask?

938
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,186
TALIESIN: Well, the first thing that we're going
to need, is we're going to need a way of

939
00:56:02,186 --> 00:56:06,229
connecting this to him without limiting his
movement, so I'm making so it's a very accessible,

940
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:11,781
easy harness to get this on and off. And starting
to design and put together how we're going to--

941
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:19,331
what I'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain
cover for the hands and face so that it actually

942
00:56:19,331 --> 00:56:23,308
looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate
suspicion, but if it does, it will look like

943
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:26,038
somebody with an artificial limb, maybe they've
been hurt.

944
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:27,520
LIAM: Get me ten sets of scissors.

945
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,926
MATT: (laughs) So are you crafting the porcelain?

946
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:32,412
TALIESIN: I am. I've got the kiln.

947
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:36,445
MATT: Yes, but your materials, you're used to
using--

948
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:41,910
TALIESIN: Instead of porcelain, I'm going for the
ceramics that I use for some of my build. It's

949
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:48,830
more practical. I've been working on some jewelry
shit, I could genuinely learn how to do this.

950
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:53,744
MATT: This is true, but the skillset for jewelry
is very different from the skillset of porcelain.

951
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,054
LIAM: I need you to make a rig, like in a video
game. Can you do that?

952
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:58,603
LAURA: I'm going go into town and buy some plates
for Laina.

953
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:00,715
MATT: Okay. I will say--

954
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:03,133
TALIESIN: I'm willing to have this--

955
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:06,030
SAM: We could just use mud from outside.

956
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,752
MATT: Do you have a set of potter's tools? Because
that would be specifically what would be used for

957
00:57:09,752 --> 00:57:14,976
this, if you're going to be working with ceramics
and porcelain.

958
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:17,623
TALIESIN: Can I roll to see? Because I have a
kiln, so I might have it,

959
00:57:17,623 --> 00:57:18,980
but I don't know if I have it--

960
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:23,863
MATT: But you have a kiln that's designed more
for-- it's more of a metal-use forge.

961
00:57:23,863 --> 00:57:25,258
TALIESIN: It's more of a metal-use forge.

962
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:29,435
MATT: So it'll destroy ceramics. It burns at a
certain heat.

963
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:31,737
TRAVIS: This could be the dumbest--

964
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:34,715
MARISHA: This is the best thing we've ever wasted
time on.

965
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:36,521
MATT: I'm so excited.

966
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:41,880
TALIESIN: If prototype one fails, I'll make it out
of pewter.

967
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,548
MATT: Okay. This is an adjacent skill set. You're
not going to get your proficiency bonus to it, but

968
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:52,800
you do have materials to essentially try it. I
want you to go ahead and roll a base dexterity

969
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,908
check. Just add your dexterity modifier. You're
not proficient.

970
00:57:58,372 --> 00:58:01,539
TALIESIN: I'm trusting in Gil, because he also
can't make a pot.

971
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:04,079
TRAVIS: Say the thing, say the incantation!

972
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,718
TALIESIN: Mecca lecca high, mecca hiney ho, don't
fuck me, Gil.

973
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:08,284
MARISHA: Where are those pottery tools, Gil?

974
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,798
TALIESIN: And those pottery tools are--

975
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:11,427
MARISHA: (laughs) It's a good roll.

976
00:58:11,427 --> 00:58:12,232
TALIESIN: 22.

977
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:18,115
MATT: 22. It takes you the better part of the next
two hours, but you manage to create some--

978
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:23,534
TALIESIN: Thank you for helping me Ghost, by the
way. Never mind.

979
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:26,547
MATT: They have to cool and harden, but in the
process of crafting it and heating it, you do have

980
00:58:26,547 --> 00:58:29,934
some decent ceramic plates that you think might
work. They're going to be fragile.

981
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:31,735
TALIESIN: That's fine.

982
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:34,874
MATT: Not like they'll crumble on their own
walking, but, if they take any sort of chip and

983
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:36,543
damage the ceramic.

984
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:38,072
TALIESIN: Hands and face is what I was hoping
for.

985
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:41,846
MATT: I'll say the better part of two hours or so
to craft them, and then you begin to heat them in

986
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:44,473
the kiln. It'll take you a while for them to
harden and set.

987
00:58:44,473 --> 00:58:48,022
TALIESIN: Okay, and we're just figuring out a
little easy armature that won't get in his way.

988
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:50,016
And I'm peeking at him, seeing how he works--

989
00:58:50,016 --> 00:58:54,484
MATT: All right. The armature, roll tinker's kit.
Check. Proficiency plus dex.

990
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:55,732
SAM: I'm going to-- oh, sorry.

991
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,664
TALIESIN: You can assist.

992
00:58:56,664 --> 00:58:59,988
MATT: Actually, this would be proficiency plus
intellect, is what it would be, because this is

993
00:58:59,988 --> 00:59:02,295
trying to figure it out specifically.

994
00:59:02,295 --> 00:59:04,949
TALIESIN: I'd be happy for an assist, unless
you're doing something.

995
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:07,688
SAM: I was going upstairs to ask one of the help
something.

996
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:15,422
TALIESIN: Oh, go ahead, okay, that's fine. I'll
just work on your robot by myself, then. 21.

997
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:19,189
MATT: Okay, easy enough to figure out a harness.
What are you doing, Tary?

998
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:24,075
SAM: What was the servant's name who you said used
to have short hair, now long?

999
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:25,977
MATT: Shayne.

1000
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:29,322
SAM: I go to her? Him?

1001
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:33,718
MATT: It's a her. She will punch you so hard.

1002
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:40,591
SAM: I offer to buy her hair for 100 gold pieces
to use as a wig.

1003
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,068
MATT: How do you say this?

1004
00:59:42,068 --> 00:59:43,961
(all laugh)

1005
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:51,964
MATT: She's literally outside, sitting on the
outside wall of the gate, leaning forward, just on

1006
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:56,370
a stool, with a loaded crossbow over her lap,
looking out at the distance. And you're down

1007
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,009
below, about 20 feet down.

1008
00:59:58,009 --> 00:59:59,279
SAM: You there, excuse me. Hello?

1009
00:59:59,279 --> 01:00:01,629
MATT: She looks over the top. "Yeah?"

1010
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:05,770
SAM: Hi! Taryon Darrington. New member of the
group. Hi.

1011
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,144
MATT: "Hi."

1012
01:00:07,144 --> 01:00:12,770
SAM: Yes, we're working on a very important
project. It's an undercover mission in a foreign

1013
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:20,260
land, and we're going to need a disguise.
Specifically, a wig, a convincing wig. We all

1014
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:26,778
thought that it might be a good idea to have some
real hair for this wig, and, well, you have

1015
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:34,314
beautiful hair. I wouldn't mind if you would lend
it to the cause. I'd like to

1016
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:36,242
buy your hair for 100 gold pieces.

1017
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:38,636
(all laugh)

1018
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,883
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion check.

1019
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:43,445
LIAM: Oh my god, where's Shorthalt when you need
him?

1020
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:44,516
LAURA: Did he roll well?

1021
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,099
TALIESIN: I'm not saying.

1022
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:50,833
SAM: Persuasion? 24.

1023
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:56,996
MATT: She goes, "You're kidding me, right?"

1024
01:00:56,996 --> 01:01:03,352
SAM: Oh, no, no, no. And I reach into my bag of
holding and pull out 100 gold and say, it would

1025
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:08,819
mean a lot to me and to my teammates if you would
cooperate in this mission.

1026
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:12,326
It might even save a life.

1027
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:24,686
MATT: She gives you this long, stern, dark look.
"(laughs) Make it 500 and you got a deal."

1028
01:01:24,686 --> 01:01:27,725
SAM: 500? All right, fine.

1029
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,139
(all laugh)

1030
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:32,378
SAM: And a bargain at that.

1031
01:01:32,378 --> 01:01:35,951
MATT: "Ah, it was getting too long, anyway." She
makes her way down the ladder and just walks past

1032
01:01:35,951 --> 01:01:44,793
you into the keep. Comes back about half an hour
later, head completely shaved smooth, and she's

1033
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:53,753
got, in a little square of fabric, a cluster of
all of her red hair. She balls it up, comes over.

1034
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:59,950
SAM: A pleasure doing business with you. This
haircut might very well be the fate of the world,

1035
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,435
so thank you.

1036
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:03,548
MATT: "You're welcome."

1037
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,346
SAM: Here's your money.

1038
01:02:06,346 --> 01:02:13,723
MATT: "Thank you. Here's your fucking hair. God
damn weirdo." And walks off and heads back to her

1039
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:14,756
perch at the top of the wall.

1040
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:15,868
SAM: Buy my book!

1041
01:02:15,868 --> 01:02:23,518
(all laugh)

1042
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:26,715
MATT: Okay. You now have Shayne's hair--

1043
01:02:26,715 --> 01:02:28,901
SAM: I'm going to try and make a wig out of it.

1044
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:29,709
MATT: Okay.

1045
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:30,730
SAM: Don't really know how.

1046
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,441
LAURA: It's just a bunch of pieces of hair.

1047
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:36,310
SAM: Glue? I've got alchemy, right? I can make,
like, goop?

1048
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,583
TALIESIN: You want a-- no, nope, I'm not helping.
Never mind. Don't want to help.

1049
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,496
MATT: You can. Do you want to do that?

1050
01:02:39,496 --> 01:02:41,576
SAM: Make some goop. Some glue to put on it.

1051
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:48,571
MATT: We'll say, using the basis of a tanglefoot
bag, which is a very simple alchemical--

1052
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:51,656
SAM: Oh, it's got goo in it, yeah.

1053
01:02:51,656 --> 01:02:53,787
TRAVIS: I mean, I can make a gallon of it.

1054
01:02:53,787 --> 01:02:58,960
MATT: You begin to apply it to the top of Doty's
head, and begin to very carefully layer hair

1055
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:05,155
across it. I'm going to need-- let's see--
(laughs) I love you guys so much.

1056
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:08,323
LAURA: How long does goop last? Will Doty just
always have hair now?

1057
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:10,070
SAM: I mean, it's pretty sticky.

1058
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,135
LAURA: Gross.

1059
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:16,292
MATT: Go ahead and make-- just make a dexterity
check.

1060
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:23,053
SAM: Okay. Okay. Ooh. Not good. I'm feeling lucky.
17.

1061
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:37,503
MATT: 17. (laughs) So it looks a little Carrot
Toppy, but it works. These clusters of poofy red

1062
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:47,297
hair, but you layer it in a way that looks as good
as you can, given the fact that you glued hair to

1063
01:03:47,297 --> 01:03:48,989
Doty's head.

1064
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:50,645
(all laugh)

1065
01:03:50,645 --> 01:03:55,464
MATT: It could've gone a lot worse. From a
distance, this kind of looks like a person.

1066
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,164
SAM: I also gave him a little bit of--

1067
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,048
MATT: Little bit of goatee?

1068
01:03:58,048 --> 01:03:59,072
SAM: Just to match me.

1069
01:03:59,072 --> 01:04:01,861
MATT: Okay, yeah, great. You now have--

1070
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:04,551
TRAVIS: Do you mean the fu man, or did you give
him the full goatee?

1071
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:06,350
Because you just did the fu manchu.

1072
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,226
SAM: Probably just the fu man.

1073
01:04:07,226 --> 01:04:08,445
MATT: All right, there you go.

1074
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:10,139
LAURA: But it's going to be covered by a mask.

1075
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,701
SAM: Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.

1076
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:15,104
MATT: You've crafted your own avatar.

1077
01:04:15,104 --> 01:04:18,015
LIAM: Is the hair curly or straight?

1078
01:04:18,015 --> 01:04:19,633
MATT: It's a little wavy.

1079
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:21,385
LIAM: Wavy, okay.

1080
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:25,839
MATT: Her hair had been short before, when it grew
out long, it came out a little wavy. So yeah, it

1081
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:35,237
has a little bit of a-- it looks like... What was
the actor's name? From Mask?

1082
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:37,986
ALL: Eric Stoltz?

1083
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:40,403
MATT: Kind of looks like that on Doty.

1084
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:43,515
TALIESIN: Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen.
Eric Stoltz. Google it.

1085
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:45,454
MARISHA: Cher was great in that.

1086
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:46,657
MATT: It's a great movie.

1087
01:04:46,657 --> 01:04:48,660
LIAM: I thought you were going to go Ronald
McDonald, so that's a step up.

1088
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,111
MATT: Yeah, see? But that's kind of the texture
and the look of the hair, from what I recall it.

1089
01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:54,680
SAM: Okay, we've set the stage.

1090
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,508
LAURA: Wow.

1091
01:04:55,508 --> 01:04:56,847
SAM: Vax, bring us home.

1092
01:04:56,847 --> 01:05:02,242
MATT: So, with the porcelain cooling off, Vax
comes back with the rest of the supplies.

1093
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:05,408
(all laugh)

1094
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:09,006
LIAM: Oh, good gods! What did you make, what did
you do?

1095
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:11,090
SAM: He's not just the president, he's a member,
too!

1096
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,584
(all laugh)

1097
01:05:12,584 --> 01:05:19,670
MATT: What's fantastic, is he's glued the facial
hair before the porcelain mask was put on, so as

1098
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,817
Percy and Vax come in with their pieces--

1099
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,453
TALIESIN: All right, I've got the-- Oh, good God!

1100
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,236
LAURA: (laughs)

1101
01:05:25,236 --> 01:05:27,293
LIAM: I mean, it's bad. It's really bad.

1102
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:29,732
TALIESIN: No, it's-- I mean, like, it's--

1103
01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:34,783
LIAM: It's a start. I think the hair will actually
help the molding clay stay in place.

1104
01:05:34,783 --> 01:05:36,249
TALIESIN: We're going to put a little wrap, it'll
be fine.

1105
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:37,348
SAM: And you've got hands?

1106
01:05:37,348 --> 01:05:38,382
LIAM: (sighs)

1107
01:05:38,382 --> 01:05:39,750
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, that too. Yes.

1108
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,462
SAM: Ah, excellent. Excellent.

1109
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:46,323
LIAM: All right. We collectively are Dr.
Frankenstein.

1110
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:47,088
LAURA: (laughs)

1111
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:47,990
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

1112
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,840
LIAM: Let's make this happen.

1113
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,020
SAM: (laughs)

1114
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:55,066
MATT: Okay. So, you put on the harness. You get
the ceramic plates on that can loosely appear to

1115
01:05:55,066 --> 01:06:00,128
be smoother, and a little more of a general
curvature to the joints, so that it looks more

1116
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:06,543
natural from a distance. You put on the-- The mask
of porcelain that you made, I mean, you know, the

1117
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:10,076
facial hair that's underneath and is on Doty's
face is going to be under the mask.

1118
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:12,054
TALIESIN: Yes. Thank God.

1119
01:06:12,054 --> 01:06:13,970
MATT: You could attempt to remove it, if you'd
like.

1120
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,615
LIAM: No, I think that'll help--

1121
01:06:15,615 --> 01:06:16,477
TALIESIN: No, no.

1122
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:17,214
SAM: No. We'll leave it.

1123
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:18,603
LIAM: -- it'll help hold all it in place.

1124
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:19,551
SAM: Just a little glue to help stick it there.

1125
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:22,135
TALIESIN: In case we're in combat and it comes
out, maybe we'll get, like, a momentary element of

1126
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:24,132
surprise as they go, 'My God, what is that?'

1127
01:06:24,132 --> 01:06:28,397
MATT: Plus it's just good to know that, at any
given point in time, Doty now has a secret goatee.

1128
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:32,553
(all laugh)

1129
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:33,745
MATT: That only you know about.

1130
01:06:33,745 --> 01:06:36,107
SAM: I had extra hair, I wanted to use it.

1131
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:38,051
TALIESIN, MATT, and MARISHA: #secretgoatee.

1132
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:41,477
(all laugh)

1133
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:44,280
TALIESIN: What is this episode? What--

1134
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,285
LIAM: Oh my God.

1135
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:47,071
MARISHA: This is the worst thing!

1136
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:51,213
MATT: All right. Play 'em home, keyboard cat. Roll
a disguise kit.

1137
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:52,732
LIAM: Oh, all right. I'm going to try to make this
a--

1138
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:54,719
TRAVIS: (keyboard sounds)

1139
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,708
LIAM: What number do I use for the disguise kit?
Dexterity?

1140
01:06:57,708 --> 01:07:02,738
MATT: No, this would be-- hold on, the toolkit
here-- with you it would be--

1141
01:07:02,738 --> 01:07:04,019
Yeah, because it is--

1142
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:05,044
LIAM: Because I'm a rogue.

1143
01:07:05,044 --> 01:07:07,006
MATT: It's how nimble your fingers are. It's a
dexterity bonus plus the proficiency modifier for

1144
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:10,253
a disguise kit. If you are proficient with this
kit, with the disguise kit?

1145
01:07:10,253 --> 01:07:11,441
LIAM: Oh, my gods.

1146
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:12,532
MATT: What are your proficiencies?

1147
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:14,624
LIAM: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know, so
I'm just going to say no.

1148
01:07:14,624 --> 01:07:15,552
MATT: Then it's just dexterity.

1149
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:16,444
LIAM: Dexterity.

1150
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:17,527
MATT: Just roll a d20, add your dex bonus.

1151
01:07:17,527 --> 01:07:22,082
LIAM: Okay. All right, I'm going to go for like, a
General Krieg-type look to the face? I'm going to

1152
01:07:22,082 --> 01:07:22,939
do my best--

1153
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:23,712
MATT: Okay.

1154
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:25,412
LIAM: -- to redheaded General Krieg?

1155
01:07:25,412 --> 01:07:26,137
LAURA: Nice.

1156
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:27,200
MATT: Okay.

1157
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,131
LIAM: Okay, here we go. I'm going to use Luck.

1158
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:31,073
LAURA: (laughs)

1159
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:31,962
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck.

1160
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:32,839
MATT: (laughs) Are you sure?

1161
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:33,528
LIAM: Yeah.

1162
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:34,190
MATT: Are you sure?

1163
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,971
LAURA: Are you sure?

1164
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:36,069
LIAM: I'm quite sure. Natural 20!

1165
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:37,085
LAURA: Oh my God.

1166
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:40,022
(all cheer)

1167
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,712
LIAM: General Krieg, it's good to see ya!

1168
01:07:41,712 --> 01:07:48,243
MATT: In spite of the absurdity of what you've
managed to accomplish with the better part of your

1169
01:07:48,243 --> 01:07:53,484
day, as the sun is now setting, and the rest of
you have been wondering what the fuck is going on

1170
01:07:53,484 --> 01:08:00,791
down there, you manage to build some semblance of
a muscular structure underneath the robes. And

1171
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:09,253
amongst the porcelain mask that Percy had set as a
base, you have crafted texture, color, it looks

1172
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:11,079
kind of like a face.

1173
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:12,777
TALIESIN: It looks like Lincoln from Disneyland!

1174
01:08:12,777 --> 01:08:13,776
(all laugh)

1175
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:16,590
MATT: It does! It looks like a shitty animatronic.
Which means--

1176
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,456
SAM: I was the sixteenth president.

1177
01:08:18,456 --> 01:08:19,324
(all laugh)

1178
01:08:19,324 --> 01:08:20,469
MATT: Like, it really does.

1179
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:21,344
LIAM: Yeah.

1180
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,714
MATT: Like, not a good Disney animatronic. Like,
state fair animatronic.

1181
01:08:23,714 --> 01:08:24,326
MARISHA: Sure.

1182
01:08:24,326 --> 01:08:24,938
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1183
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:26,353
TALIESIN, LIAM, and LAURA: Chuck E. Cheese.

1184
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:28,020
MATT: Yeah. This has been through a few fires.

1185
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,226
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say, been
through a fire!

1186
01:08:29,226 --> 01:08:30,394
TRAVIS: (animatronic sounds)

1187
01:08:30,394 --> 01:08:35,728
MATT: Yeah, it's Bonnie Springs. It's straight-up
Bonnie Springs. But, given the circumstances, not

1188
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:36,672
too bad!

1189
01:08:36,672 --> 01:08:38,205
TALIESIN: Boys, I'm so proud of both of you.

1190
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:41,904
LIAM: Guys, art is subjective, all right? Put
clothes on top of this thing and

1191
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:43,501
we're golden, I think.

1192
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:45,242
LAURA: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage.

1193
01:08:45,242 --> 01:08:47,465
(all laugh)

1194
01:08:47,465 --> 01:08:51,141
LIAM: Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody!

1195
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:53,833
TALIESIN: I'm quite pleased. I'm quite pleased.

1196
01:08:53,833 --> 01:09:02,136
SAM: I didn't think that Doty could be improved,
but you all impressed me today. Thank you. Thank

1197
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:03,068
you for this.

1198
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:03,967
TALIESIN: Good work, everybody.

1199
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:04,717
SAM: Good work.

1200
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:05,510
TALIESIN: Good work, everybody.

1201
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,323
SAM: Yes.

1202
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:07,073
LIAM: Good teamwork.

1203
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:07,730
SAM: Teamwork!

1204
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,463
LIAM: Yeah.

1205
01:09:08,463 --> 01:09:10,396
SAM: Yes! Feels good to say it!

1206
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:14,562
LIAM: Well, good work.

1207
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:17,773
SAM: Shall we go to Vasselheim?

1208
01:09:17,773 --> 01:09:19,836
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

1209
01:09:19,836 --> 01:09:21,071
TALIESIN: Grog?

1210
01:09:21,071 --> 01:09:22,885
TRAVIS: And I'll come down.

1211
01:09:22,885 --> 01:09:23,833
TALIESIN: Grog!

1212
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,904
LAURA: What have you been doing up there?

1213
01:09:24,904 --> 01:09:27,046
TRAVIS: Is that General Krieg? (screams)

1214
01:09:27,046 --> 01:09:28,606
(all laugh)

1215
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:29,503
TALIESIN: It's all right! It's all right!

1216
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:30,938
SAM: No, no, no!

1217
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:33,795
TALIESIN: It's very expensive, don't break it.

1218
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:38,562
TRAVIS: Why have you aligned yourself with this
creature?

1219
01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:41,174
LIAM: I knock on the side of its head.

1220
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:43,399
SAM: (hollow metal knocking sounds)

1221
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,506
LIAM: That's not Krieg.

1222
01:09:44,506 --> 01:09:46,084
LAURA: It's Dootie.

1223
01:09:46,084 --> 01:09:51,529
TRAVIS: No. Dootie did not have fire crotch hair.
He did not have a face or hands--

1224
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:52,464
SAM: Did you say 'fire crotch'?

1225
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:53,441
TALIESIN: Yes, he did.

1226
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:54,715
TRAVIS: --or a cloak. He didn't have any of that
stuff.

1227
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:57,554
LIAM: Yeah, but Grog, we glued it on. We Dorked
with it.

1228
01:09:57,554 --> 01:10:00,315
TRAVIS: Oh, he's wearing a disguise! Yes.

1229
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:01,139
LIAM: Yes, he's a disguised robot.

1230
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:01,956
TRAVIS: Who did that?

1231
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:02,735
TALIESIN: Oh, all of us.

1232
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,009
TRAVIS: As a team?

1233
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:04,772
MARISHA: Mainly these three--

1234
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:05,722
LIAM: Mostly Keyleth.

1235
01:10:05,722 --> 01:10:06,398
TRAVIS: Right.

1236
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:09,993
MATT: It occurs to you guys, you don't know where
the hair came from.

1237
01:10:09,993 --> 01:10:11,593
LIAM: What?

1238
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:13,184
MARISHA: Druidcraft.

1239
01:10:13,184 --> 01:10:13,898
TRAVIS: Wow.

1240
01:10:13,898 --> 01:10:14,658
TALIESIN: Wow, well done.

1241
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:16,254
LIAM: Got all your hair--

1242
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,775
TRAVIS: Could you do that to me?

1243
01:10:17,775 --> 01:10:19,785
TALIESIN: Where did you get the hair?

1244
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:20,659
LIAM: Where is the hair from?

1245
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:21,710
TALIESIN: What is it?

1246
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,527
SAM: I've got some tricks up my sleeve. (laughs)

1247
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:27,350
LIAM: Did you pull it like a patch off and it
turns into a bunch of hair?

1248
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,947
SAM: Maybe. Maybe I did.

1249
01:10:28,947 --> 01:10:30,183
LIAM: God, magic is amazing.

1250
01:10:30,183 --> 01:10:32,715
LAURA: Did you get glue all over my robe that I
put on him?

1251
01:10:32,715 --> 01:10:34,312
SAM: Maybe. Maybe I did.

1252
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:35,969
MATT: Make a perception check.

1253
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:38,837
LAURA: Oh, motherfucker.

1254
01:10:38,837 --> 01:10:41,682
LIAM: That'll do all right.

1255
01:10:43,014 --> 01:10:44,805
LAURA: 24.

1256
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:45,783
MATT: (singsong) That robe is ruined.

1257
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,883
LAURA: Oh no! It's not ruined!

1258
01:10:47,883 --> 01:10:51,880
MATT: (laughs) Certainly. Elements of it are
permanently glued to Doty.

1259
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,314
MARISHA: Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe
now. Sorry.

1260
01:10:55,314 --> 01:10:57,508
LAURA: That was my stealth robe.

1261
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:58,828
MARISHA: And now your--

1262
01:10:58,828 --> 01:11:01,170
SAM: And will be once more, I'll have it cleaned
and pressed for you.

1263
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,007
LIAM: Wait there's glue on the--

1264
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,164
TALIESIN: That's the stealth robe?

1265
01:11:03,164 --> 01:11:06,176
LIAM: -- on the elven cloak? Oh.

1266
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:07,261
TALIESIN: Oh.

1267
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:08,298
MARISHA: Does that mean that the--

1268
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,959
SAM: It's a magical item you put on?

1269
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:11,744
LAURA: (laughs nervously) Yes.

1270
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:12,875
TALIESIN: You put a magical item on the robot?!

1271
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,159
LAURA: That's the only robe I fucking had!

1272
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,617
TALIESIN: (laughs)

1273
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:17,424
TRAVIS: Wow.

1274
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:18,155
LIAM: Oh, that--

1275
01:11:18,155 --> 01:11:19,025
TRAVIS: For nothing.

1276
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,787
LAURA: (shouts) I didn't know you were going to
glue it to him!

1277
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:22,228
LIAM: Much sentimental value--

1278
01:11:22,228 --> 01:11:23,468
LAURA: (shouts) I know!

1279
01:11:23,468 --> 01:11:25,650
TALIESIN: Now there's a robot with sentimental
value.

1280
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:29,840
LIAM: It's all right, you're still alive.
Whoop-dee-doo. Let's just do the thing, come on.

1281
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,188
MARISHA: You're right, now that I've blurred my
vision, the glue is the most noticeable part.

1282
01:11:35,188 --> 01:11:37,161
MATT: (laughs)

1283
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:39,633
TALIESIN: I think it blends into the texture,
actually, quite nice.

1284
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:41,050
Makes it look like he's seen some shit.

1285
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,199
LAURA: Motherfucker! Let's go to Vasselheim.

1286
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,029
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

1287
01:11:44,029 --> 01:11:45,592
MATT: Okay.

1288
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:47,464
TALIESIN: I'll buy you a new robe.

1289
01:11:47,464 --> 01:11:52,494
MATT: Doty's been standing there, and as soon as
you guys say let's go and Doty starts moving, it has

1290
01:11:52,494 --> 01:11:55,605
this scary Return to Oz feel to it--

1291
01:11:55,662 --> 01:12:00,357
LAURA: Ew. I like it.

1292
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,436
TALIESIN: This is everything I've ever wanted.

1293
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:03,691
MATT: (Doty walking sounds)

1294
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:04,843
LIAM: Oh, man.

1295
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:06,940
MARISHA: Hey, where did you learn contouring?

1296
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,602
LIAM: What--

1297
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:10,917
MARISHA: (laughs) Because that's really well
done.

1298
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,594
LIAM: You've seen what I can do with hair, right?
I mean, are you really surprised?

1299
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:14,980
MARISHA: Good point, let's go.

1300
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,071
MATT: It's the elvish half.

1301
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:16,955
MARISHA: It's the elvish half.

1302
01:12:16,955 --> 01:12:18,907
TRAVIS: It's the elvish half.

1303
01:12:18,907 --> 01:12:20,244
LIAM: Clasp time, Clasp time.

1304
01:12:20,244 --> 01:12:25,286
MATT: Yeah. All right, so. You go ahead and head
up to the Temple of Sarenrae within your keep,

1305
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:29,541
there is the central tree there. You go ahead and
Transport via Plants to--

1306
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,094
MATT and MARISHA: Vasselheim!

1307
01:12:31,094 --> 01:12:32,336
MATT: Where in Vasselheim do you want to exit?

1308
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:35,104
MARISHA: And we have the book? We have the book in
the chest? Chest and the book?

1309
01:12:35,104 --> 01:12:36,162
TALIESIN: We have the book.

1310
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:37,010
MARISHA: All right.

1311
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:38,812
LAURA: Not the chest, but in the bag of holding.

1312
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,048
TALIESIN: But we have the book. Yeah.

1313
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:41,035
LAURA: Wrapped in cloth.

1314
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:46,188
MARISHA: Where? Wasn't there the tree that was
near the Slayer's Take?

1315
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:48,373
MATT: There is one, yeah, there's one that patches
there.

1316
01:12:48,373 --> 01:12:49,287
MARISHA: Yeah. We'll do that.

1317
01:12:49,287 --> 01:12:50,833
MATT: Okay, so you use that one.

1318
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,335
LIAM: Let's use that save point.

1319
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:57,137
MARISHA: Yeah. What do they call it? Never mind.

1320
01:12:57,137 --> 01:12:58,169
MATT: Okay.

1321
01:12:58,169 --> 01:12:58,974
LAURA: Waypoint.

1322
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,843
MARISHA: There! Yes, thank you.

1323
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:04,534
TRAVIS: The waypoint.

1324
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:14,490
MATT: So, as you guys emerge it is still early
afternoon in Vasselheim. The sun is just setting

1325
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:19,799
in your location, you guys have travelled far
northwest at this point when it was still midday.

1326
01:13:19,799 --> 01:13:24,194
You emerge roughly in the center of the Quad Roads,
a little bit north-center area of the Quad Roads.

1327
01:13:24,252 --> 01:13:27,679
What are you looking for?

1328
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,519
LAURA: Well, we should go--

1329
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:31,488
TALIESIN: Library.

1330
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:32,431
LAURA: Yes, the library.

1331
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:33,653
LIAM: Library.

1332
01:13:33,653 --> 01:13:38,166
LAURA: We delivered the horn of Orcus to the
Platinum Dragon.

1333
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,314
MATT: Yeah, the Platinum Sanctuary.

1334
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,486
LAURA: Yes. So we should probably go talk to them
as well.

1335
01:13:41,486 --> 01:13:46,248
MARISHA: Because I imagine they'd have a good
hiding place?

1336
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:48,255
TALIESIN: It's where I'd put the Ark of the
Covenant, certainly.

1337
01:13:48,313 --> 01:13:50,174
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
01:13:50,174 --> 01:13:53,009
LAURA: And also to talk to them about Orcus.

1339
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:54,065
MARISHA: Correct.

1340
01:13:54,065 --> 01:13:55,010
LAURA: Since that's--

1341
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:57,181
MARISHA: And then shops for more potions.

1342
01:13:57,181 --> 01:14:02,600
LIAM: Do we want to split up? You want to go talk
Orcus?

1343
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,971
MARISHA: That's actually not a bad plan.

1344
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,217
LAURA: Yeah. Sure.

1345
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:08,575
MARISHA: Okay. You're going to go research Orcus?

1346
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:09,430
LIAM: Yeah.

1347
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:10,340
MARISHA: The twins?

1348
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,002
LIAM: Yeah.

1349
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:13,442
MARISHA: All right. Percy, you want to go to the
Platinum Reserve?

1350
01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:14,988
TALIESIN: Always.

1351
01:14:14,988 --> 01:14:20,614
MARISHA: All right. We'll take the book. Tary? You
want to come with us or the twins?

1352
01:14:20,614 --> 01:14:22,101
SAM: With you, absolutely.

1353
01:14:22,101 --> 01:14:23,428
MARISHA: All right. Grog?

1354
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:25,659
TRAVIS: Ugh, god, the options both suck.

1355
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:29,465
(all laugh)

1356
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,507
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1357
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,022
TALIESIN: Go with the twins, they're more inclined
to violence.

1358
01:14:32,022 --> 01:14:33,891
LAURA: Oh, Grog could also go learn about the Nine
Hells!

1359
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:36,237
TRAVIS: No, no no. Okay, wait. Books?

1360
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:36,753
LAURA: Yeah.

1361
01:14:36,753 --> 01:14:38,784
TRAVIS: Nope. What are you doing?

1362
01:14:38,784 --> 01:14:41,037
MARISHA: Books.

1363
01:14:41,037 --> 01:14:43,717
TRAVIS: No. I'm doing my own thing.

1364
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:45,080
LIAM: We're gonna go learn about scary
things, though.

1365
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,983
SAM: I've been wanting to buy some potions and
things, is that an option here?

1366
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,628
MARISHA: Oh, do you want to be team potions?

1367
01:14:51,628 --> 01:14:53,364
TALIESIN: And buying things? You like buying
things.

1368
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,227
MARISHA: Team Shopping, right Grog?

1369
01:14:55,227 --> 01:14:56,338
LAURA: Tary-- Tary!

1370
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:57,797
MATT: Grog's really good at buying potions.

1371
01:14:57,797 --> 01:14:59,542
LAURA: Tary-- I pull Tary aside.

1372
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:00,616
SAM: Yes, what?

1373
01:15:00,616 --> 01:15:06,407
LAURA: If you're going to go shopping with Grog
you need to know-- don't look at him. He is

1374
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:07,732
terrible with money.

1375
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:08,796
TALIESIN: I can't look away.

1376
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:16,450
LAURA: Tary, he's terrible with money. I mean
like, he will offer them-- stop it! He will offer

1377
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,267
them double what they ask for.

1378
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:26,123
SAM: Oh. And that's not good? Don't worry, I've
been raised around money,

1379
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:28,796
I know its worth. I have--

1380
01:15:28,796 --> 01:15:29,550
LAURA: I'm just saying--

1381
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,374
SAM: -- at least six trust funds and they're all
managed quite well.

1382
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:35,306
LAURA: (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.

1383
01:15:35,306 --> 01:15:36,592
LIAM: Tru-- what?

1384
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:39,364
LAURA: Just keep an eye on him, all right?

1385
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:44,173
SAM: I will receive your trust.

1386
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:46,446
LAURA: (sighs)

1387
01:15:46,446 --> 01:15:51,322
SAM: And I will fulfill your request as a fellow
member of this team.

1388
01:15:51,322 --> 01:15:52,953
LAURA: (strained) Fabulous.

1389
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:54,922
SAM: Thank you for entrusting me with this
mission.

1390
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:58,891
TALIESIN: Thank you, Tary, good luck. Grog, keep
an eye on him, make sure that everything's--

1391
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:00,222
TRAVIS: Oh, I will.

1392
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,133
LIAM: As they leave, I spank Grog hard on the ass
and say, money was meant to be spent!

1393
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:05,199
LAURA: (laughs)

1394
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,879
TRAVIS: I like that twin.

1395
01:16:06,879 --> 01:16:12,457
MATT: (laughs) All right, you scatter into three
different directions. First--

1396
01:16:12,457 --> 01:16:14,262
MARISHA: To the library?

1397
01:16:14,262 --> 01:16:15,172
MATT: All right.

1398
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,474
LAURA: No, you were going to the Platinum
Sanctuary.

1399
01:16:16,474 --> 01:16:17,662
TRAVIS: Yeah, Jesus. (laughs)

1400
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:18,614
LAURA: We're going to the library.

1401
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:21,910
MARISHA: Which is to the place where they--

1402
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,357
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1403
01:16:23,357 --> 01:16:24,547
TALIESIN: Archive.

1404
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:26,927
MARISHA: (shouts) To the archive!

1405
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:29,928
SAM: Did you guys both say goodbye and then you're
walking the same direction?

1406
01:16:29,928 --> 01:16:32,651
MATT: Yep! Yeah.

1407
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:34,507
TRAVIS: Oh, you're parked over here, too? Oh,
okay, cool.

1408
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,091
TALIESIN: I'm tired-- okay, this is awkward now,
we'll just keep--

1409
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,043
MARISHA: They're right next door, they're
connected, they're partners.

1410
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:41,369
LIAM: Well some people go this way, and some
people go that way and some people go both ways!

1411
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:44,378
MATT: (laughs) All right, so you guys make your
way up to the Platinum Sanctuary, you head to the

1412
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:50,662
base of the central mountain that the north end of
Vasselheim is built around, to the winding stair

1413
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:57,993
that leads up to the Sanctuary proper. There, as
you ascend, you can see the sun is getting to the

1414
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:04,746
three to four o'clock in the afternoon position.
The color of the sky's starting to turn a bit

1415
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:12,153
different. You guys make your way to the outside
doors of the Sanctuary, where you see the guards

1416
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:18,980
are there, stationed, and as you approach, some of
them put up a bit of an aggressive front from a

1417
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:22,856
defensive standpoint, but one of them does
recognise you and approaches, pulls the front of

1418
01:17:22,856 --> 01:17:28,544
his helmet up. "You are Vox Machina."

1419
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:30,663
LAURA: We are.

1420
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:33,187
MATT: "What business do you have here at the
Platinum Sanctuary?"

1421
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:40,894
LAURA: We have come to discuss the (whispers) Horn
of Orcus that we delivered here a while ago.

1422
01:17:40,894 --> 01:17:48,378
MATT: "So you request an audience with Scalebearer
Vord?"

1423
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:49,601
LAURA: Mm-hm.

1424
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:52,009
LIAM: Yeah. That guy.

1425
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,992
TRAVIS: The sphinx's name.

1426
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:57,041
LAURA: What?

1427
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,195
TRAVIS: The sphinx's name.

1428
01:17:58,195 --> 01:17:59,419
LAURA: I don't remember.

1429
01:17:59,419 --> 01:18:03,335
MATT: (laughs) All righty. Highbearer Vord. He
says, "Very well. Please to be patient, I believe

1430
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:04,350
"he is busy."

1431
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,239
LAURA: Oh. Right.

1432
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:07,273
MATT: And he heads inside, the doors close
behind.

1433
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:12,860
LAURA: As he does that, I look to Vax and go, hey,
I have an idea. So the book we have, right?

1434
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,805
LIAM: Mm?

1435
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:18,754
LAURA: What if instead of leaving it here, we left
it at the Raven Queen's sanctuary? Don't you think

1436
01:18:18,754 --> 01:18:25,165
they would keep it more safe? Because she hates
undead, right? This is like her nemesis, right?

1437
01:18:25,165 --> 01:18:34,766
LIAM: She does. Yeah, I mean, that's a whole
thing, I don't think that's a bad idea, but I feel

1438
01:18:34,766 --> 01:18:37,495
like if I go there, I need to stay for a bit.

1439
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:38,498
LAURA: Oh, really?

1440
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:39,733
LIAM: Yeah.

1441
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:41,225
LAURA: Do you want to do that?

1442
01:18:41,225 --> 01:18:44,251
LIAM: No, not yet.

1443
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:46,762
LAURA: All right, cool. Let's forget I mentioned
anything.

1444
01:18:46,762 --> 01:18:49,460
LIAM: Let's do that.

1445
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,589
LAURA: All right.

1446
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:57,087
MATT: All right. About 15 minutes or so pass
as you guys are led up. It's a gorgeous view

1447
01:18:57,146 --> 01:19:05,615
from up here, by the way, I mean, for Vasselheim,
the cloud cover is probably 70 to 80% of the year,

1448
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:11,129
with coming storms and sleet. This is one of the
few days you've been during this part of the

1449
01:19:11,129 --> 01:19:18,708
season where the sky is open. You actually see
some blue in the sky, and as the light of the day

1450
01:19:18,768 --> 01:19:24,737
begins to grow more towards a dusk color you start
seeing the distant change and it's just endless

1451
01:19:24,737 --> 01:19:30,944
thick, dense forest of the Vesper Timberland all
around the city. And so there's kind of this

1452
01:19:30,944 --> 01:19:32,595
serene waiting period as well.

1453
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,504
LAURA: I just lean against Trinket.

1454
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:40,483
MATT: Trinket just (bear noises). You calm Trinket
a bit. Trinket doesn't like heights and is up here

1455
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:45,785
on this platform, it's literally like a very small
rail and then it drops probably a good 150, 200

1456
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:51,875
feet down, and so Trinket's just like staying as
far away from the edge as possible. Eventually the

1457
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:58,330
doors shift and one side opens up slightly, the
same guard walks out. "All right, very well.

1458
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:06,247
"Follow me." Turns around. Leads you in. He's
carrying his large, very well-polished tower

1459
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:10,699
shield to his side, he still has his helmet visor
up. Leads you into the central structure.

1460
01:20:10,699 --> 01:20:13,241
LAURA: Do we know what we're going to say?

1461
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:21,646
LIAM: We're going to talk about the book. We're
going to ask them if they can destroy it.

1462
01:20:21,646 --> 01:20:24,676
LAURA: Or hold it, right? Do something with it.

1463
01:20:24,676 --> 01:20:26,572
LIAM: Preferably destroy.

1464
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:31,524
LAURA: Okay. It's history, though.

1465
01:20:31,524 --> 01:20:35,421
LIAM: It's dangerous.

1466
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:37,796
LAURA: True.

1467
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:43,514
MATT: You guys are led to the audience chamber.
Surrounded by the wide den of pillars and the

1468
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:46,515
central area has a hole above the top of the
temple where the light comes through and there you

1469
01:20:46,515 --> 01:20:54,015
see, stepping in hurriedly from the opposite side,
flanked by two advisors is Highbearer Vord, the

1470
01:20:54,015 --> 01:21:00,285
Silver Touched. You see his elven form is very
fine-featured, his skin still very pale, almost

1471
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:11,020
pearlescent when the light hits it and his robes
flow behind him, dragging a good four or five feet

1472
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:16,134
across the center. It's such an open space between
the circular pillars that hold this-- it's just

1473
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:21,068
this tiny image of him approaching you amongst
this wide-open space with his two advisors. As the

1474
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:26,379
footsteps get louder and louder as he approaches.
"So yes, you've summoned me,

1475
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:28,666
"what is your business?"

1476
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:32,531
LAURA: Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I
know your time is precious.

1477
01:21:32,531 --> 01:21:33,839
MATT: "Yes."

1478
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:41,035
LAURA: We however came across, in fighting the
Chroma Conclave and defeating them, this book

1479
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:50,885
which references Opash's search into necromancy.
NecromANcy? NecrOmancy.

1480
01:21:50,885 --> 01:21:51,783
SAM: NecrOmancy.

1481
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:52,822
MATT: NecrOmancy. Josh NecrOmancy?

1482
01:21:52,822 --> 01:21:54,712
LIAM: NECromancy.

1483
01:21:54,712 --> 01:21:56,040
LAURA: Necrome-- yes.

1484
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,818
TRAVIS: Necromé?

1485
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:58,005
LAURA: Necromé.

1486
01:21:58,005 --> 01:22:01,295
LIAM: (laughs) Does that name mean anything to
you?

1487
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:11,330
MATT: "I have read of it, yes. I mean, it's a
creature of lore. Opash was before the Divergence,

1488
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:17,572
"even. If you indeed found a tome that once
belonged to him, this is of much interest to us

1489
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:21,874
"and our network of researchers."

1490
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:23,843
LIAM: Research?

1491
01:22:23,843 --> 01:22:25,261
LAURA: Researchers.

1492
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:27,182
MATT: "Well, yes."

1493
01:22:27,182 --> 01:22:29,589
LAURA: It's an evil tome.

1494
01:22:29,589 --> 01:22:32,905
MATT: "I can only assume it is, you are right."

1495
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:46,681
LIAM: We came to Vasselheim to dispose of it. My
sister has read it. Parts of it, and--

1496
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:49,022
LAURA: (whispers) All of it.

1497
01:22:49,022 --> 01:22:54,774
LIAM: It's foul. It should not be allowed to
exist.

1498
01:22:54,774 --> 01:23:01,996
MATT: "We can ensure that it falls into no hands
beyond this temple. However, we do have to

1499
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:07,947
"research the contents, you understand. The
necessity of understanding the evils and darkness

1500
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:11,798
"that are out there, that when they arise we can
properly counter them."

1501
01:23:11,798 --> 01:23:13,064
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

1502
01:23:13,064 --> 01:23:15,040
MATT: Yes, go for it.

1503
01:23:18,578 --> 01:23:20,228
LAURA: (groans)

1504
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,368
TRAVIS: Turd burgers.

1505
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:25,628
LAURA: It's not terrible, but it ain't good, 14.

1506
01:23:25,628 --> 01:23:32,765
MATT: 14. He's hard to read in general,
disposition and station, and his eyes are so

1507
01:23:32,765 --> 01:23:41,299
white, like the iris is almost not visible. And
he's stone-faced in his explanation but he's making

1508
01:23:41,429 --> 01:23:45,379
sense, you know. If you have information on--

1509
01:23:45,446 --> 01:23:47,893
LAURA: Necromancy.

1510
01:23:47,893 --> 01:23:49,332
MATT: On necromancy!

1511
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:50,538
LAURA: Yes.

1512
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:51,571
TALIESIN: Jif.

1513
01:23:51,571 --> 01:23:55,564
MATT: Or any devices that darker forces utilize,
it better prepares you if

1514
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:58,469
you know what those entail.

1515
01:23:58,475 --> 01:23:59,438
LAURA: Right.

1516
01:23:59,438 --> 01:24:02,274
MATT: And if there is any place that could
withstand the corruption of such a book, it would

1517
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:08,616
be the strongest focus of the Platinum Dragon's
divine power that exists on the planet.

1518
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:09,911
LAURA: Well, that's good.

1519
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:15,972
MATT: So, you get the sense that Vord is not
deceiving you.

1520
01:24:15,972 --> 01:24:18,034
LAURA: Okay.

1521
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,205
LIAM: What happens after you research it?

1522
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:25,801
MATT: "We seal it in the vaults below, same place
we stored the horn."

1523
01:24:25,801 --> 01:24:33,091
LIAM: Has that vault ever been disturbed in its
entire history?

1524
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:39,746
MATT: "It's been a long time and we've reinforced
it. If I recall, last time you were here you

1525
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:43,832
"encountered some of our defense yourselves."

1526
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,270
LAURA: Yes.

1527
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:50,508
MATT: "I think you'll know by memory that we are
well fortified. So--"

1528
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,810
LAURA: Be warned, the book tried to claim me.

1529
01:24:58,168 --> 01:25:08,491
MATT: "Hmm. If you resisted it, I have no doubt
our clerics can as well." He nods his head over to

1530
01:25:08,491 --> 01:25:09,850
one of his advisors.

1531
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,721
TRAVIS: Shade.

1532
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:12,829
LAURA: I know, yeah.

1533
01:25:12,829 --> 01:25:13,750
TRAVIS: Dark shade.

1534
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,028
MATT: This young man with a very, very tight braid
pulled to the back of the head that dangles about

1535
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:21,073
mid-back behind silver and white robes just
approaches and puts his hands out

1536
01:25:21,073 --> 01:25:25,172
to accept the tome.

1537
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:32,228
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't clear. We came to
discuss it. We don't have it now.

1538
01:25:33,844 --> 01:25:39,340
MATT: Puts his hands aside and steps back. "Oh.
Well. Return with the tome, should you see fit to

1539
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,280
"leave it here."

1540
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:46,421
LAURA: Can I ask you, how much do you know of
Orcus?

1541
01:25:48,206 --> 01:25:50,332
MATT: "I know enough."

1542
01:25:51,237 --> 01:25:56,119
LAURA: I don't know much of anything, and it's
important that we learn.

1543
01:25:56,119 --> 01:26:04,304
MATT: "Hmm." So, he nods to one of the other
advisors who steps off for a moment. "Sit a

1544
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:10,599
"moment. This is a conversation to have." And some
of the guards come and bring a few chairs and set

1545
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:24,250
them behind you. "Orcus, the demon prince of
undeath, resides in the depths of Thanatos, one of

1546
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:33,082
"the varying realms of the Abyss. It is here that
he snuffs the life from all creatures and brings

1547
01:26:33,082 --> 01:26:44,967
"them under his sway. He is an entity of
ever-hungering need for power, and to take all

1548
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:51,593
"life and break it so he can bring it under his
control. Thankfully, as one of the betrayer gods,

1549
01:26:51,593 --> 01:26:58,233
"he was sealed away, and the Divine Gate was placed
up to prevent his, and any other evil entities'

1550
01:26:58,233 --> 01:27:08,925
"entrance into our world. However, that does not
prevent him from sending his minions, sending his

1551
01:27:08,925 --> 01:27:16,476
"powers, sending his influence out through the
permeable, small gaps in this gate. So his

1552
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:18,231
"influence remains."

1553
01:27:20,138 --> 01:27:23,455
LAURA: He only has two horns, right?

1554
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:26,406
MATT: "Oh! Four, once."

1555
01:27:27,927 --> 01:27:29,225
LAURA: Four?

1556
01:27:29,225 --> 01:27:34,141
MATT: "Two that he maintains on himself to this
day, and two that were severed, enchanted, and

1557
01:27:34,141 --> 01:27:39,396
"bequeathed into two of his, at the time, one of his
champions."

1558
01:27:39,571 --> 01:27:42,777
LIAM: And all these many months, you've been in
possession of the horn you have?

1559
01:27:42,777 --> 01:27:44,534
MATT: "Yes."

1560
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:47,048
LAURA: And you don't have another one down in that
vault?

1561
01:27:47,048 --> 01:27:48,288
MATT: "We do not."

1562
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:51,545
LIAM: What have you learned of the one you do
have?

1563
01:27:51,545 --> 01:27:58,999
MATT: "Well, this belonged to a great and terrible
champion of Orcus. It was utilized in the

1564
01:27:58,999 --> 01:28:08,924
"Calamity, the war that came to the very gates of
Vasselheim. This armored evil was destroyed and

1565
01:28:08,924 --> 01:28:16,287
"torn asunder, the horn scattered. We currently
have some of our finest and brightest out in

1566
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:23,038
"search of the other one, now that we know they
have and can be recovered. Not to any avail yet,

1567
01:28:23,038 --> 01:28:25,168
"but we're doing our best."

1568
01:28:28,215 --> 01:28:31,883
LAURA: If you hear any word of that horn, will you
send word to us?

1569
01:28:31,883 --> 01:28:33,528
MATT: "Of course. And you do the same, please."

1570
01:28:33,528 --> 01:28:35,114
LAURA: Of course.

1571
01:28:35,114 --> 01:28:37,455
MATT: "One was dangerous enough."

1572
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:48,091
LIAM: We need to discuss a few things, but we'll
fetch the tome.

1573
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:49,192
MATT: "Very well."

1574
01:28:49,192 --> 01:28:51,461
LAURA: Thank you so much for your time.

1575
01:28:51,937 --> 01:28:56,799
MATT: "I don't have much of it. If you have
business to discuss with me personally, I would

1576
01:28:56,799 --> 01:29:01,347
"recommend doing it now. Otherwise, you'll be
dealing with one of my advisors when you return."

1577
01:29:01,786 --> 01:29:05,385
LAURA: Do you know much about the Nine Hells?

1578
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:09,496
MATT: "That's a complicated subject. What do you
need to know?"

1579
01:29:09,496 --> 01:29:12,606
LAURA: I fear we have to travel there.

1580
01:29:12,606 --> 01:29:17,888
MATT: "Why, pray tell, do you intend to travel
there?"

1581
01:29:17,888 --> 01:29:30,027
LAURA: There is a rakshasa after my brother and
our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I

1582
01:29:30,027 --> 01:29:34,217
fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at
the source.

1583
01:29:34,217 --> 01:29:36,365
LIAM: It's already made one attempt.

1584
01:29:36,365 --> 01:29:37,579
MATT: "Hmm."

1585
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:39,421
LIAM: It's only a matter of time.

1586
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:50,209
MATT: "I've dealt with fiends. I've dealt with
devils. I am not a specialist on the Hells, but

1587
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:58,335
"there are a few places where you could possibly
research this information. Majority of such

1588
01:29:58,335 --> 01:30:08,475
"research is found in the presence, or at least in
the grasp of the Cobalt Soul. They do have one

1589
01:30:08,475 --> 01:30:16,711
"small temple here in the city, and they have one
over in Tal'Dorei. Either one will have some

1590
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:24,224
"semblance of research at their disposal. What I
can tell you is, in asking about Orcus and the

1591
01:30:24,224 --> 01:30:31,570
"Abyss, those are demons, entities, savage,
chaotic, in selfish, hard to read societies that

1592
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:38,455
"twist, crumble and rebuild, a rate that only
insanity can seem to drive. Madness and hunger

1593
01:30:38,455 --> 01:30:47,748
"drives the Abyss. But the Hells, the Hells are
built on tyranny. They are built on societies,

1594
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:59,616
"power structures, subservience and dominance.
Whereas few mortals dare tread in the Abyss, there

1595
01:30:59,616 --> 01:31:06,474
"have been some from many different realms, who go
to the Hells to do business."

1596
01:31:09,943 --> 01:31:16,063
LAURA: Do you know what sort of people might
survive there?

1597
01:31:16,063 --> 01:31:18,190
LIAM: Or fit in?

1598
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:34,979
MATT: "Powerful ones. Ones that stay out of sight.
Ones that don't make a scene. Just know; they're

1599
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:43,574
"very clever, and above all else, they seek your
soul."

1600
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:47,888
LAURA: All right.

1601
01:31:48,593 --> 01:31:52,045
LIAM: No big.

1602
01:31:52,104 --> 01:31:53,825
LAURA: All right.

1603
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:55,838
LIAM: Thank you for your time.

1604
01:31:55,838 --> 01:31:57,666
LAURA: So, we'll go to the Cobalt Reserve.

1605
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:01,240
MATT: "All right. One of my advisors will receive
the tome upon its delivery."

1606
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,055
LAURA: Fabulous. Thank you.

1607
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:04,526
MATT: "Good luck."

1608
01:32:04,526 --> 01:32:05,917
LAURA: (whistles)

1609
01:32:05,917 --> 01:32:08,896
MATT: He stands up and as soon as you begin to
stand up, the seats are already immediately pulled

1610
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:15,148
out from behind you. The guards separate them, he
leaves with his advisors and you guys are led out

1611
01:32:15,148 --> 01:32:20,530
of the temple back onto the winding staircase and
into the heart of Vasselheim.

1612
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:32,289
LIAM: I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't
know what the right thing to do is. I thought one

1613
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:33,663
thing going in there.

1614
01:32:33,663 --> 01:32:34,900
LAURA: Mm-hm.

1615
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:43,073
LIAM: And now I think maybe you were right. I have
not wanted to go to that temple, though. She has

1616
01:32:43,073 --> 01:32:45,923
finally been speaking to me again.

1617
01:32:45,923 --> 01:32:49,615
LAURA: All right. What about?

1618
01:32:49,615 --> 01:33:01,177
LIAM: When I died, I saw her. I have dreamed of
her already. And she speaks of some sort of

1619
01:33:01,177 --> 01:33:12,540
purpose on the horizon. And I don't know if she's
talking about your promise you made, or what. But

1620
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:19,918
she is with us. And I barely know what the fuck
I'm doing, but I know that she doesn't want that

1621
01:33:19,918 --> 01:33:29,697
book to exist. And, honestly, I am frightened of
going to that temple because I want time. I want

1622
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:34,590
time with you, I want time with Keyleth, I want
time.

1623
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:35,781
LAURA: All right.

1624
01:33:35,781 --> 01:33:40,213
LIAM: And I don't want to lose that time now, I
want to be selfish for a little while. We've been

1625
01:33:40,213 --> 01:33:43,858
working so fucking hard, by all rights we should
be dead.

1626
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:49,919
LAURA: Do you think if you go to the Raven Queen's
temple, she'll claim you for her own right now?

1627
01:33:49,919 --> 01:33:54,938
LIAM: Well, I don't know. I don't know. And look
at this. And I start to unbuckle the front of my

1628
01:33:54,938 --> 01:33:57,575
chest-- Relax, look at this.

1629
01:33:58,059 --> 01:33:59,724
LAURA: What am I seeing? (laughs)

1630
01:33:59,724 --> 01:34:05,796
MATT: You see right around his heart there's a
dark spot in the skin where some dark veins travel

1631
01:34:05,796 --> 01:34:08,198
for about an inch or two across.

1632
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:09,275
LAURA: What the fuck is this?

1633
01:34:09,275 --> 01:34:10,595
LIAM: I don't know.

1634
01:34:10,595 --> 01:34:11,968
LAURA: When did it happen?

1635
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,019
LIAM: I don't know.

1636
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:15,677
LAURA: What do you mean, you don't know? Did it
happen after you died?

1637
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:20,643
LIAM: I think so. Hurts a little bit.

1638
01:34:20,643 --> 01:34:25,656
LAURA: What the fuck? We have to get you to a
cleric, that's not normal!

1639
01:34:25,656 --> 01:34:31,110
LIAM: Not really, no. I cover it back up.

1640
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:35,929
LAURA: Are you sure it's related to her?

1641
01:34:40,376 --> 01:34:45,433
LIAM: But I think you are right, and I think that
they're going to hold that, and someone will take

1642
01:34:45,433 --> 01:34:50,202
it, whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand
years, and she doesn't want it and--

1643
01:34:50,521 --> 01:34:53,522
LAURA: Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus.
Playing devil's advocate.

1644
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:57,268
LIAM: Yeah, they already have that. They don't
have this.

1645
01:34:57,852 --> 01:34:59,756
LAURA: Then let's go to the Raven Queen's temple.

1646
01:34:59,756 --> 01:35:00,939
LIAM: All right.

1647
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:01,837
LAURA: Do you want to go now?

1648
01:35:01,837 --> 01:35:02,531
LIAM: Yes.

1649
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:04,008
LAURA: Let's go.

1650
01:35:04,856 --> 01:35:11,571
MATT: Okay, while you guys make your way to the
Raven's Eyrie, we go to you two. You guys are

1651
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:16,280
currently looking for a library. Who wants to make
the investigation check to ask for information?

1652
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:19,051
TALIESIN: I'll do it, that's funny.

1653
01:35:20,558 --> 01:35:23,484
LAURA: Would I have known anything about what that
thing was?

1654
01:35:24,774 --> 01:35:32,097
MATT: Not really. It doesn't look diseased. It
looks bruised almost. It's just a strange-looking

1655
01:35:32,097 --> 01:35:35,548
bruise where you can see some of the veins are
dark and visible,

1656
01:35:35,548 --> 01:35:38,032
almost like varicose near the surface.

1657
01:35:39,619 --> 01:35:40,826
LAURA: Like trauma?

1658
01:35:40,826 --> 01:35:44,681
MATT: Kind of, yeah, but it doesn't look--

1659
01:35:44,915 --> 01:35:46,712
LAURA: It doesn't look like Raishan's?

1660
01:35:46,712 --> 01:35:49,156
MATT: No, it's not like that.

1661
01:35:50,136 --> 01:35:57,361
MARISHA: So, we have the book. They went to the
sanctuary. We are going to the library.

1662
01:35:57,361 --> 01:35:58,230
MATT: Yes.

1663
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:58,956
TALIESIN: Okay.

1664
01:35:58,956 --> 01:35:59,599
MARISHA: Okay!

1665
01:35:59,599 --> 01:36:00,704
MATT: As far as I know, that's what you guys are
searching for.

1666
01:36:00,704 --> 01:36:02,612
LAURA: Wait, I thought we had the book.

1667
01:36:02,612 --> 01:36:06,360
TALIESIN: It's in the-- wait, no, the book's in
the bag.

1668
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,868
TRAVIS: And I'm the one with the low
intelligence.

1669
01:36:07,868 --> 01:36:09,843
MATT: (singsong) Grog has the book.

1670
01:36:09,843 --> 01:36:15,245
MARISHA: You guys, I thought our whole thing was
that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and

1671
01:36:15,245 --> 01:36:18,953
then you guys were like, we're going to the
sanctuary, because you guys totally gave me shit

1672
01:36:18,953 --> 01:36:23,692
when I was like, the library, and you were like,
not the library, but apparently we are.

1673
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:25,571
TALIESIN: Yes.

1674
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,133
MARISHA: All right. Let's go to the library.

1675
01:36:27,133 --> 01:36:28,740
TALIESIN: I rolled a 16.

1676
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,756
MATT: It's like Vox Machina has a hard time
planning.

1677
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:32,814
(all laugh)

1678
01:36:32,814 --> 01:36:34,084
TALIESIN: Don't agree with him.

1679
01:36:34,084 --> 01:36:34,957
MATT: It's crazy.

1680
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:36,388
TALIESIN: That's not fair.

1681
01:36:36,388 --> 01:36:37,522
SAM: I'm the new guy.

1682
01:36:37,522 --> 01:36:39,467
(all laugh)

1683
01:36:39,467 --> 01:36:40,739
TRAVIS: "I'm the new guy."

1684
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,179
TALIESIN: 16, investigation.

1685
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:44,378
MARISHA: We said we had the book.

1686
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:46,658
TALIESIN: We thought we did, we were not paying
attention.

1687
01:36:46,658 --> 01:36:47,664
MATT: Did you say you took the book?

1688
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:49,182
MARISHA: I thought we took the book, that was our
whole fucking plan--

1689
01:36:49,182 --> 01:36:50,537
TALIESIN: I thought we took the book too.

1690
01:36:50,537 --> 01:36:52,102
MARISHA: -- that we took the damn book.

1691
01:36:52,102 --> 01:36:53,926
TALIESIN: It occurs to me it was actually in the
bag that Grog was holding.

1692
01:36:53,926 --> 01:36:56,731
MARISHA: But I would assume if we said, "we're
taking the book", that would mean--

1693
01:36:56,731 --> 01:36:59,382
MATT: If you guys said you're taking the book;
Grog, you heard them take the book?

1694
01:36:59,382 --> 01:37:01,690
TRAVIS: I thought you said you were taking the
book to go look at the wherever.

1695
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:03,196
MARISHA: We have the book.

1696
01:37:03,196 --> 01:37:06,806
MATT: All right. I'll take that as consensus to
say that you guys have the book.

1697
01:37:06,806 --> 01:37:09,074
SAM: Oh, I used the book to make the wig. Is that
okay?

1698
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:11,035
(all laugh)

1699
01:37:11,035 --> 01:37:13,523
SAM: It's just, it's all paper.

1700
01:37:13,523 --> 01:37:15,730
LAURA: It's glued under the cloak.

1701
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:16,735
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1702
01:37:16,735 --> 01:37:19,088
TALIESIN: Papier-mâché of evil.

1703
01:37:19,088 --> 01:37:24,298
MATT: Okay. You guys, not having a bag of holding,
are clutching the tome--

1704
01:37:24,298 --> 01:37:26,742
it's a big tome, it's like--

1705
01:37:26,742 --> 01:37:28,661
MARISHA: I thought we put it in a box, right?

1706
01:37:28,661 --> 01:37:29,939
MATT: No.

1707
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:32,410
TALIESIN: No, we didn't have a box.

1708
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:36,865
LAURA: There was no box. It was a book wrapped in
cloth in the bag of holding.

1709
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:37,607
SAM: In a box.

1710
01:37:37,607 --> 01:37:39,137
MARISHA: We wrapped it in cloth.

1711
01:37:39,137 --> 01:37:43,375
MATT: So there you go. You have a tome wrapped in
cloth under your arm. You guys spend about an hour

1712
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:52,163
or so asking around. The locals, they're-- not
saying they're not friendly, but not all of them

1713
01:37:52,163 --> 01:37:57,602
are well-versed in what you're asking. You say
library, some of them are more simpler folk are

1714
01:37:57,602 --> 01:38:03,420
like, "I don't--" and eventually somebody says,
"Oh yeah, you can head over to the-- what's it

1715
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:09,493
"called? The Cobalt Vault. It's in the southern
region of the Quad Roads."

1716
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:11,107
TALIESIN: That's exactly what I was looking for,
thank you so much.

1717
01:38:11,107 --> 01:38:13,134
MATT: "All right, yeah, I'll show you." And the
guy gives you a couple directions down the road,

1718
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:18,296
and you make your way there, and it's similar to
the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun, but it's about a

1719
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:19,860
quarter of the size.

1720
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,075
MARISHA: Okay.

1721
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:26,902
MATT: The Cobalt Reserve is the center of the
Cobalt Soul monk order, the Ioun worshipers that

1722
01:38:26,902 --> 01:38:39,217
gather information and maintain it. As Ioun's
presence was shattered slightly during the

1723
01:38:39,217 --> 01:38:50,892
Calamity, in the battle against the chained god,
her presence in Vasselheim was diminished and then

1724
01:38:50,892 --> 01:38:58,789
regrew through the Cobalt Soul in Westruun, so
it's expanding back into Vasselheim. You make your

1725
01:38:58,789 --> 01:39:06,986
way to the structure. The exterior of it is this
light-grey stone, it's a cylindrical building with

1726
01:39:06,986 --> 01:39:16,346
three different doorways around the outside and a
giant, bright blue and black marbled dome on top.

1727
01:39:16,346 --> 01:39:23,737
It looks somewhat transparent, like it's made of a
glass-type material. As you step into the front,

1728
01:39:23,737 --> 01:39:30,002
you can see a central chamber within the inside
that's also cylindrical, so you have a small

1729
01:39:30,186 --> 01:39:37,081
walk-around hallway on the immediate inside of
this giant structure, and then the actual library

1730
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:40,961
is in the interior, and so on the outside, you see
a few books and there are some paintings and

1731
01:39:40,961 --> 01:39:48,956
tapestries on the walls and you see a few varying
monks walking around, a handful that are curious

1732
01:39:48,956 --> 01:39:54,178
and turn as you walk in. They're all wearing the
uniform, dark grey and blue robes of the Cobalt

1733
01:39:54,178 --> 01:40:02,365
Soul, and there is a desk at the front, where you
have a young woman of olive skin sitting, her hair

1734
01:40:02,365 --> 01:40:08,075
short and wavy with very thick spectacles adorning
the front of her nose. Young-ish, maybe

1735
01:40:08,075 --> 01:40:21,101
mid-twenties. She looks up as soon as you guys
approach. "Good day. I fear we're still in the

1736
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:26,999
"process of preparing the interior, but what do you
require?"

1737
01:40:27,267 --> 01:40:31,405
TALIESIN: We were hoping for access to some of the
deep research archives. We've been looking around,

1738
01:40:31,405 --> 01:40:39,099
we have several complicated matters that we need
to research, and we heard that you had a wonderful

1739
01:40:39,156 --> 01:40:44,706
collection and we were hoping to gain access to
some materials, preferably of the histories of

1740
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:47,878
Orcus, the Nine Hells, a few various things.

1741
01:40:48,806 --> 01:40:56,005
MATT: "I'm terribly sorry, that type of research
is only for Cobalt Soul members."

1742
01:40:57,484 --> 01:41:00,752
TALIESIN: Who could we talk to about special
access?

1743
01:41:00,752 --> 01:41:03,369
I'm sure that there must be somebody in charge.

1744
01:41:04,897 --> 01:41:07,227
MATT: "I apologize, I am--"

1745
01:41:08,528 --> 01:41:10,033
MARISHA: I'm sorry--

1746
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:11,665
MATT: "I'm going to have--"

1747
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:16,885
MARISHA: I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari and this
is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel

1748
01:41:16,885 --> 01:41:18,884
Klossowski de Rolo III.

1749
01:41:18,884 --> 01:41:20,634
TALIESIN: Close enough.

1750
01:41:20,634 --> 01:41:27,109
MARISHA: We're a part of the group Vox Machina,
we've been through here before, we're part of the

1751
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:37,668
Slayer's Take. This is a matter of great
importance, so if there is any type of upper

1752
01:41:37,668 --> 01:41:39,371
management we could talk to--

1753
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:40,343
(all laugh)

1754
01:41:40,343 --> 01:41:43,086
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

1755
01:41:43,086 --> 01:41:44,478
TRAVIS: Fuck this. It's just that dismount at the
end.

1756
01:41:44,478 --> 01:41:45,972
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) Who wants to talk to the
librarian?

1757
01:41:45,972 --> 01:41:46,970
MATT: It's Keyleth's specialty.

1758
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,462
LIAM: It was going great.

1759
01:41:48,462 --> 01:41:53,889
MARISHA: (coughs) Mm, 11.

1760
01:41:53,889 --> 01:42:03,241
MATT: "I mean no offense, but I don't think we
have the kind of research that you're looking for

1761
01:42:03,241 --> 01:42:05,240
"that we could--"

1762
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:10,050
TALIESIN: We would also possibly like to make a
donation. And I pull out the Manual of Quickness

1763
01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:13,179
of Action, place it upon the table.

1764
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:22,697
MATT: She adjusts her glasses for a second and
reaches into the desk and pulls out a small, white

1765
01:42:22,697 --> 01:42:27,901
gem and passes it over, and as she does, you can
see the front of the tome seems to glow almost

1766
01:42:27,901 --> 01:42:32,256
like a blacklight over something that was reactive
to it.

1767
01:42:33,873 --> 01:42:35,905
SAM: Covered in semen.

1768
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:40,327
MATT: As soon as I said it, I was waiting for Sam
on that one.

1769
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:41,601
SAM: Sure, sure.

1770
01:42:41,601 --> 01:42:44,601
TALIESIN: Thank you for ruining that one for me
for all time.

1771
01:42:45,153 --> 01:42:54,011
MATT: Scans over. "Perhaps. Give me just a moment,
please." And she slides the book in your

1772
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:57,802
direction, gets up and exits through one of the
small doors in the side, that you didn't notice

1773
01:42:57,802 --> 01:43:02,375
until now. It's part of a similar stone, just
gives way and then closes behind her.

1774
01:43:02,448 --> 01:43:04,181
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see what happens now.

1775
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:08,699
MARISHA: And yet, worst case scenario, I also have
this book that Scanlan read that's on how to be a

1776
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:10,309
good leader--

1777
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:12,695
TALIESIN: Hold on to that one.

1778
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:14,558
MARISHA: All right, I'll hold on to it.

1779
01:43:15,695 --> 01:43:25,726
MATT: The door opens again and she comes back out,
followed by a man of very, very dark skin, bright,

1780
01:43:25,726 --> 01:43:32,282
soft eyes that crack on the sides from, you can
gather, a lot of smiling. He wears the same

1781
01:43:32,282 --> 01:43:41,158
uniform, blue and gray robes, but as he walks, you
can hear what sounds almost like a faint-- almost

1782
01:43:41,158 --> 01:43:47,049
like jewelry clanging, but you don't see any
jewelry on him, and as he approaches, his arms are

1783
01:43:47,049 --> 01:43:54,036
folded into themselves, and he steps forward
quietly, looks at the book for a second, looks up

1784
01:43:54,036 --> 01:44:05,000
at the two of you, and smiles, "Hello. My name is
Kusuo and I am in charge of looking over this

1785
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:11,420
"extension of the Cobalt Reserve's reach and
collection.

1786
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:15,290
"You have come to offer this book as trade?"

1787
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,067
TALIESIN: Yes.

1788
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:17,590
MATT: "And you are seeking what?"

1789
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:24,212
TALIESIN: Well, we are in a bit of a bind. We are
members of a traveling group of adventurers known

1790
01:44:24,386 --> 01:44:29,045
as Vox Machina. We recently helped defeat the
Chroma Conclave.

1791
01:44:29,653 --> 01:44:35,952
MATT: "I'm familiar with your exploits as of late,
yes. It is our job to collect information and

1792
01:44:35,952 --> 01:44:39,892
"history and record of it, so I am very aware."

1793
01:44:39,892 --> 01:44:45,256
TALIESIN: Well, the deeds and those things that
must be done have not yet been fulfilled. We have

1794
01:44:45,256 --> 01:44:54,317
just a few last, treacherous events that we must
complete before the Chroma Conclave is completely

1795
01:44:54,317 --> 01:45:02,314
put to rest. One of which has to do with Orcus,
and the other with the Nine Hells.

1796
01:45:02,314 --> 01:45:04,525
MARISHA: It's a rakshasa.

1797
01:45:04,525 --> 01:45:13,641
TALIESIN: And we are desperate for knowledge that
may keep us safe in our travels. Prepare us for

1798
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,529
our enemies.

1799
01:45:17,512 --> 01:45:23,331
MATT: "Come with me." And he takes the book and
sweeps it up, and it vanishes into his robe.

1800
01:45:23,822 --> 01:45:25,344
TALIESIN: Worth it!

1801
01:45:25,855 --> 01:45:30,507
MATT: He leads you into the small doorway that you
watched open and shut before, and on the inside,

1802
01:45:30,507 --> 01:45:41,030
you go from this barren outer walkway, into this
large cylindrical library that is from floor to

1803
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:51,655
ceiling about 60 feet tall, with dozens of ladders
that move around, and you can see books are in the

1804
01:45:51,655 --> 01:45:55,785
process of being put up, some books are being
categorized, it looks like there were stacks that

1805
01:45:55,785 --> 01:45:59,181
have just arrived that are in the process of being
researched and copied, there are a number of these

1806
01:45:59,181 --> 01:46:05,175
monks that are at different tables in the process
of making copies of books, this is specifically a

1807
01:46:05,175 --> 01:46:12,315
repository for the gathering and guarding of
information. In the center of the chamber, there

1808
01:46:12,315 --> 01:46:18,392
is a spiral staircase that leads to an upper
platform that has another series of chairs, either

1809
01:46:18,392 --> 01:46:22,894
a research or reading section, and there are only
a handful of people on the interior that are not

1810
01:46:22,894 --> 01:46:30,340
dressed in the same way that these monks are, but
each one of them is attended by a monk. And you--

1811
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:35,335
MARISHA: Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that
look recognizable?

1812
01:46:35,335 --> 01:46:37,501
MATT: Make a perception check.

1813
01:46:39,867 --> 01:46:42,508
TALIESIN: Yeah, use that one. That's weird.

1814
01:46:42,508 --> 01:46:45,274
MARISHA: It's on another dice? All right.

1815
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:46,196
TALIESIN: There, that's better.

1816
01:46:46,196 --> 01:46:47,261
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

1817
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:47,951
TALIESIN: What is that? Oh--

1818
01:46:47,951 --> 01:46:49,470
MARISHA: That's a 19! Perception?

1819
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,393
MATT: Perception.

1820
01:46:50,393 --> 01:46:53,884
MARISHA: 21. Sorry, 20. Yeah, 21.

1821
01:46:53,884 --> 01:46:55,038
MATT: Okay, so you glance around--

1822
01:46:55,038 --> 01:46:57,216
MARISHA: No! 31!

1823
01:46:57,216 --> 01:46:59,567
MATT: There we go! I was like, your wisdom's
pretty high--

1824
01:46:59,567 --> 01:47:01,021
MARISHA: 31.

1825
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:06,964
MATT: Okay. You look around really fast, glance at
each person that is not of the Cobalt Reserve's

1826
01:47:06,964 --> 01:47:13,955
attire, no one you recognize. But they all appear
to be fairly affluent. And they're all in the

1827
01:47:13,955 --> 01:47:21,832
process of reading through some sort of thick book
with a stack next to them, of varying sizes, and

1828
01:47:21,832 --> 01:47:25,540
the monk is just standing there patiently,
watching them as they do so.

1829
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:26,902
TALIESIN: That's disconcerting.

1830
01:47:26,902 --> 01:47:32,606
MATT: And you recall, from your first time at the
Cobalt Reserve, that no books can be taken from

1831
01:47:32,606 --> 01:47:37,997
the Reserve. They can be read within the interior,
they can be copied, notes can be taken. But you

1832
01:47:37,997 --> 01:47:43,403
cannot remove them, and the monk that is assigned
to you is both a guide, and to make sure you don't

1833
01:47:43,403 --> 01:47:44,900
take anything you're not supposed to.

1834
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,168
MARISHA: Right. Theft protection.

1835
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:52,847
MATT: Yes. And it seems that Kusuo has taken upon
himself to be your assigned monk.

1836
01:47:52,847 --> 01:47:55,650
TALIESIN: There's quite a bustle today, this is
impressive.

1837
01:47:55,705 --> 01:48:02,324
MATT: "It is more than we are used to, usually.
But we are happy to know that people are

1838
01:48:02,324 --> 01:48:05,493
"interested in knowledge. Any given day."

1839
01:48:05,493 --> 01:48:09,487
MARISHA: Any reason for the sudden spark in
interest?

1840
01:48:09,487 --> 01:48:16,551
MATT: "Well, recent events of dragons terrorizing
countrysides, leads people to want to defend

1841
01:48:16,551 --> 01:48:22,568
"themselves and learn of these occasional
terrors."

1842
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:24,431
MARISHA: Good on them.

1843
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:29,819
MATT: "Anyway, follow me." And he leads you to the
back of the spiral staircase, as it comes and

1844
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:37,031
meets with the floor, there is a large rug that
sits as part of the decor there, and he glances

1845
01:48:37,031 --> 01:48:44,802
around, and using his foot, his toe clips the edge
of it and flicks up and catches the rug, folds it

1846
01:48:44,802 --> 01:48:50,862
and sets it down, in one swift motion you weren't
expecting, and with the dust that sets off, you

1847
01:48:50,862 --> 01:48:56,971
now see what looks to be a trap door of the same
material as the hardwood floor of the library. The

1848
01:48:56,971 --> 01:49:01,291
small chain that he then bends down carefully,
tugs and lifts, and you see the staircase that

1849
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:02,640
descends below.

1850
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,747
MARISHA: Can you do that with your toes?

1851
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:05,892
TALIESIN: Not with my toes, no.

1852
01:49:05,892 --> 01:49:10,350
LIAM: That's some Name of the Rose shit right there.

1853
01:49:10,409 --> 01:49:18,771
MATT: "The books you require, we keep in the
cellar. So, please, after you." It's a staircase.

1854
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,231
(all laughs)

1855
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:22,903
TALIESIN: No! I'm committed!

1856
01:49:22,903 --> 01:49:24,090
MATT: (laughs) You're just going down--

1857
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:25,600
LIAM: Then an escalator!

1858
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:31,760
MATT: You're dog paddling your way through the
darkness. You guys descend and the trap door

1859
01:49:31,817 --> 01:49:37,598
closes behind you and it is pitch black. You have
no vision, you can see in the vicinity, the stairs

1860
01:49:37,598 --> 01:49:42,977
go down maybe 20 feet, however as soon as the trap
door closes, a soft glow emanates from behind you

1861
01:49:42,977 --> 01:49:50,073
and you can see there is some sort of a dangling
wristband with a small glass marble that hangs at

1862
01:49:50,073 --> 01:49:55,012
the end that is now glowing with a soft
candlelight, and Kusuo is holding his arm in front

1863
01:49:55,012 --> 01:50:00,627
of him as it dangles like a candle, and he slowly
brushes past you and leads the way down before the

1864
01:50:00,627 --> 01:50:08,208
stairs stop and level off into an open chamber, a
square room, the cellar as he called it. There,

1865
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:15,084
inside, you see candelabras flickering in the
corners, there's four of them, two near you and

1866
01:50:15,084 --> 01:50:20,611
two on the far side. Within the shadowed,
subterranean chamber, you see shelves and locked

1867
01:50:20,611 --> 01:50:27,611
cases throughout. Some cases are glass, some are
almost crate-like, but they have locks on the

1868
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:33,286
sides, and on these shelves it isn't books stacked
to each end, each book is facing forward, and

1869
01:50:33,286 --> 01:50:37,851
seems to be placed deliberately, and some of them
are chained in, some of them have chains that

1870
01:50:37,851 --> 01:50:42,509
dangle from the piece-- this is where all the
secret books are kept.

1871
01:50:42,509 --> 01:50:44,971
This is the private collection.

1872
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:48,140
TALIESIN: Books that want to get out.

1873
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:52,435
MATT: As soon you guys enter the space, two monks
of the Cobalt Soul spin out of the corners and

1874
01:50:52,435 --> 01:50:55,527
immediately stand in the defensive position with
their arms out in front of them, and then as soon

1875
01:50:55,527 --> 01:51:03,366
as they see Kusuo smiles and nods, they put their
guard down, arms together, and they bow for Kusuo.

1876
01:51:03,422 --> 01:51:08,708
Kusuo turns back over the shoulder, "Do not worry,
this is Wailen and Sura, they are assigned to

1877
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:18,315
"watch over. So, stand aside, help our guests." He
walks forward and leads you through some of these

1878
01:51:18,315 --> 01:51:22,482
cases, and you look and they're made of different
woods, some of them seem to have been brought from

1879
01:51:22,482 --> 01:51:31,394
different locations, and there are scroll cases,
there are giant wads of ancient parchment that are

1880
01:51:31,394 --> 01:51:38,263
clustered together and bound with some sort of a
leather strip, you can see tomes all across the

1881
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:45,845
way of different fronts and sizes, and some of
them are very old and ruined. And in the back

1882
01:51:45,845 --> 01:51:53,200
right corner of this chamber, you see Kusuo pulls
what you didn't notice before, and that jangling

1883
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:58,935
sound you were hearing before is a giant ring of
over a hundred keys that he pulls off of his neck.

1884
01:51:58,935 --> 01:52:01,939
He turns it and begins just thumbing through the
keys, very quickly, like he knows exactly what

1885
01:52:01,939 --> 01:52:09,125
he's doing. Catches one key, looks at it, and
walks over to one of the cases in that corner of

1886
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:14,455
the room and just undoes the locks, but they're a
different key for each lock, and he goes and finds

1887
01:52:14,455 --> 01:52:20,178
each one. First try, knows exactly where they go.
As each lock is taken, he opens the case and on

1888
01:52:20,178 --> 01:52:29,584
the inside you smell this scent of dust and ash,
and there are four books in there, two of which

1889
01:52:29,584 --> 01:52:38,182
look damaged, but they all look very old, and he
reaches in and grabs two of them. One of them is

1890
01:52:38,182 --> 01:52:44,652
one of the damaged ones, one of them is not. "You
seek information on Orcus?" Sets one tome down on

1891
01:52:44,652 --> 01:52:53,091
one of the nearby closed cases. "And the Nine
Hells." Places the other next to it.

1892
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:58,014
TALIESIN: I just try and see if I can discern what
the other two books are just from looking in and

1893
01:52:58,014 --> 01:53:00,492
being a nerd.

1894
01:53:00,492 --> 01:53:03,650
MATT: They don't have any labelling on the cover.

1895
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:13,057
TALIESIN: Oh, nothing. All right. Fascinating.
Thank you. I suppose we'll sit, and get to it.

1896
01:53:13,057 --> 01:53:14,007
MATT: "Very well."

1897
01:53:14,007 --> 01:53:15,309
TALIESIN: And I sit down and I open the book.

1898
01:53:15,309 --> 01:53:16,969
MARISHA: Yes. Which one are you opening?

1899
01:53:16,969 --> 01:53:21,071
TALIESIN: Before I touch it, this doesn't react
poorly to people handling it, does it?

1900
01:53:21,071 --> 01:53:22,604
There's no--

1901
01:53:22,604 --> 01:53:31,537
MATT: He arcs an eyebrow towards you. "No, part
of our distinct training is to disable any sort of

1902
01:53:31,607 --> 01:53:35,122
"wards should you wish to research."

1903
01:53:35,122 --> 01:53:36,708
TALIESIN: Excellent.

1904
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:39,556
MARISHA: Which one are you opening, Percy?

1905
01:53:39,556 --> 01:53:42,281
TALIESIN: I open the first one just to look
into--

1906
01:53:42,281 --> 01:53:44,083
MARISHA: The Orcus one?

1907
01:53:45,037 --> 01:53:46,619
MATT: Do you speak Abyssal?

1908
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:50,478
TALIESIN: I do not speak Abyssal.

1909
01:53:50,478 --> 01:53:55,095
MATT: The Orcus tome you aren't able to read. It
is all in Abyssal.

1910
01:53:55,095 --> 01:54:00,230
TALIESIN: Do you speak Abyssal? And the other
book--

1911
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,922
MATT: The other book?

1912
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:04,613
TALIESIN: -- I open up the Nine Hells, take a
look.

1913
01:54:04,613 --> 01:54:05,998
MATT: That one is actually written in Common.

1914
01:54:05,998 --> 01:54:07,106
TALIESIN: Okay.

1915
01:54:07,106 --> 01:54:08,181
MARISHA: Weird question.

1916
01:54:08,181 --> 01:54:10,264
MATT: Yes.

1917
01:54:10,264 --> 01:54:11,618
MARISHA: Abyssal.

1918
01:54:11,618 --> 01:54:14,228
MATT: Yes.

1919
01:54:14,228 --> 01:54:20,045
MARISHA: I know creatures who are from the Abyss,
right? I've encountered them?

1920
01:54:20,045 --> 01:54:22,222
MATT: You have encountered demons in your past,
yes.

1921
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:30,746
MARISHA: If I do a Shapechange into a demon, can I
then read Abyssal?

1922
01:54:30,746 --> 01:54:32,684
MATT: Lemme look at the spell real fast.

1923
01:54:32,684 --> 01:54:35,534
SAM: You're going to change into a pit fiend in
the library?

1924
01:54:35,534 --> 01:54:38,746
MARISHA: I would let him know! I would give him
like a disclaimer.

1925
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:42,984
TALIESIN: I'm going to show you a really weird
birthmark, don't panic.

1926
01:54:47,054 --> 01:54:52,750
LAURA: I mean, if he really was a demon, why would
he need to do research?

1927
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:55,620
TALIESIN: Who is my father?! I don't know.

1928
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:59,508
LAURA: Genealogy of the Nine Hells!

1929
01:55:00,792 --> 01:55:10,392
MATT: It does not specify, but it says you gain
the abilities.

1930
01:55:10,392 --> 01:55:12,963
LIAM: I think I've read it says you keep the same
intellect, though, right?

1931
01:55:12,963 --> 01:55:13,950
MATT: Yeah, you keep the same intellect.

1932
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,290
MARISHA: You keep the same mental stats.

1933
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,202
MATT: Correct.

1934
01:55:16,202 --> 01:55:18,098
MARISHA: But you get the abilities--

1935
01:55:18,098 --> 01:55:21,093
MATT: Yeah, you retain all your skills and saving
throw and proficiencies, in addition to gaining

1936
01:55:21,093 --> 01:55:22,904
those of the creature.

1937
01:55:22,904 --> 01:55:24,152
MARISHA: In addition.

1938
01:55:24,152 --> 01:55:29,743
MATT: You don't know.

1939
01:55:29,743 --> 01:55:31,110
MARISHA: I don't know.

1940
01:55:31,110 --> 01:55:32,641
SAM: Might as well try!

1941
01:55:32,641 --> 01:55:37,024
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment also before
this happens, open the Common book, take a moment,

1942
01:55:37,024 --> 01:55:43,961
and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading
glass around, because I still don't have any

1943
01:55:43,961 --> 01:55:45,657
reading glasses.

1944
01:55:45,657 --> 01:55:51,846
MATT: (laughs) He gives a curious look. "But of
course." And he snaps his fingers, and the other

1945
01:55:51,846 --> 01:55:57,460
monks, he just darts off for a second and then
returns a moment later with a small wooden case

1946
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:03,957
that opens up, and on the inside there are four
different types and thickness of reading glass you

1947
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,989
can go through. You find one that'll work okay.

1948
01:56:05,989 --> 01:56:13,748
TALIESIN: Perfect. I'm going to let you deal with
this other end of things, because I'm going to sit

1949
01:56:13,748 --> 01:56:16,519
and read.

1950
01:56:16,682 --> 01:56:19,847
MARISHA: What was that demon guy we encountered?
Does he have a name?

1951
01:56:19,847 --> 01:56:21,512
TALIESIN: Phil.

1952
01:56:21,512 --> 01:56:23,199
SAM: You mean the pit fiend, or--?

1953
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:24,840
LAURA: Oh, you mean like Senokir?

1954
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,468
LIAM: No, he was a genasii.

1955
01:56:27,468 --> 01:56:35,535
MARISHA: The pit fiend was a devil. Who was the
guy who lied to us, and you said devil at one

1956
01:56:35,535 --> 01:56:38,232
point, and he was actually a demon.

1957
01:56:38,232 --> 01:56:41,459
LAURA: You said he was a demon and he was actually
a devil.

1958
01:56:41,459 --> 01:56:45,353
MATT: That was a glabrezu. That was what killed
Pike.

1959
01:56:45,353 --> 01:56:47,359
TALIESIN: What about the basement way back when?

1960
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:48,409
TRAVIS: Where we found you?

1961
01:56:48,409 --> 01:56:49,263
TALIESIN: Yeah, remember?

1962
01:56:49,263 --> 01:56:50,379
LAURA: The succubus?

1963
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:52,233
MATT: That was after you found Percy. This was in
the palace of Emon.

1964
01:56:52,233 --> 01:56:53,562
LAURA: What about the succubus?

1965
01:56:53,562 --> 01:56:54,812
LIAM: The succubus. And that thing with the
bones.

1966
01:56:54,812 --> 01:56:56,548
MARISHA: Succubus are-- yeah.

1967
01:56:56,548 --> 01:56:57,717
LAURA: We did kill a succubus.

1968
01:56:57,717 --> 01:56:58,496
MATT: You did, yeah.

1969
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,619
LIAM: In Krieg's house.

1970
01:56:59,619 --> 01:57:00,780
MARISHA: And they're demons, right?

1971
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:05,813
MATT: They are fiends. You're not sure. You don't
have enough knowledge--

1972
01:57:05,813 --> 01:57:07,929
Are you trained in religion?

1973
01:57:07,929 --> 01:57:08,915
MARISHA: No.

1974
01:57:08,915 --> 01:57:10,360
TALIESIN: But you could ask me. Well, I'm not--

1975
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:15,142
MATT: Yeah. You're not too familiar. Part of this
research is learning the distinguishing factors

1976
01:57:15,142 --> 01:57:17,631
between fiends. You don't have a whole lot of
knowledge of that.

1977
01:57:17,631 --> 01:57:20,809
MARISHA: Okay. You know what? You're reading the
book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what

1978
01:57:20,809 --> 01:57:22,611
fiends there are.

1979
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:23,263
TALIESIN: All right.

1980
01:57:23,263 --> 01:57:24,026
MARISHA: Right?

1981
01:57:24,026 --> 01:57:24,852
MATT: Maybe.

1982
01:57:24,852 --> 01:57:25,752
TALIESIN: Maybe. I'm reading the book.

1983
01:57:25,752 --> 01:57:26,481
MARISHA: Read the book.

1984
01:57:26,481 --> 01:57:27,226
MATT: Okay. There we go.

1985
01:57:27,226 --> 01:57:29,607
(all laugh)

1986
01:57:29,607 --> 01:57:31,735
LIAM: Saviors of the universe, we are.

1987
01:57:31,829 --> 01:57:32,797
MATT: So.

1988
01:57:32,797 --> 01:57:34,616
TALIESIN: Do you know the dewey decimal system?

1989
01:57:34,616 --> 01:57:36,510
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs)

1990
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:39,031
MATT: What're you trying to find? Do you want to
just read all the information? It'll take you--

1991
01:57:39,031 --> 01:57:41,969
TALIESIN: I'm skipping specifically through Orcus,
and also since she mentions what she's--

1992
01:57:41,969 --> 01:57:43,368
MATT: There's no Orcus in this book. This is about
the Nine Hells.

1993
01:57:43,368 --> 01:57:51,444
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so sorry. Hierarchies. I'm
trying to get a general overlay of some of the

1994
01:57:51,444 --> 01:57:57,425
information if there's a natural enemy for the
rakshasas.

1995
01:57:57,425 --> 01:57:59,776
Any weaknesses, where we can find them.

1996
01:57:59,776 --> 01:58:04,359
MATT: Okay. You do know there is a very strong
infernal hierarchy of all the hells.

1997
01:58:04,359 --> 01:58:08,770
TALIESIN: I'm also seeing what the book also
specializes in.

1998
01:58:08,826 --> 01:58:13,120
MATT: Yes, that's what it looks like as
he's reading.

1999
01:58:13,175 --> 01:58:21,757
It's a very rigid power structure here. And
the whole purpose of most devils is to try and gain

2000
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:24,388
power and ascend their rank by proving themselves
stronger or

2001
01:58:24,445 --> 01:58:26,595
tearing others down to take their position.

2002
01:58:26,595 --> 01:58:29,210
TALIESIN: So anyone lower would be an enemy,
anyone higher would probably--

2003
01:58:29,210 --> 01:58:33,971
MATT: Well, they'll work together because it is a
lawful evil society. It is a society that only

2004
01:58:33,971 --> 01:58:36,846
functions because of its structure.

2005
01:58:38,338 --> 01:58:41,284
So it is tyrant and underlings. And
underlings will work and serve things they hate

2006
01:58:41,316 --> 01:58:47,600
that are more powerful in hope of gaining the
favor, especially since higher devils can bequeath

2007
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:50,434
lower devils the chance to ascend to a higher
tier.

2008
01:58:50,434 --> 01:58:53,841
TALIESIN: Are there stories of anybody defeating a
rakshasa before?

2009
01:58:53,841 --> 01:59:00,715
MATT: You glance through, and rakshasas, like any
other devil, can be killed. If you can go to it

2010
01:59:00,715 --> 01:59:08,899
and kill it. But there are many tiers here. There
are archdevils at the top. That are the rulers of

2011
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:15,335
each-- essentially the top ranks. There are
greater devils below them. Greater devils include

2012
01:59:15,335 --> 01:59:22,609
horned devils, erinyes, which you've encountered,
pit fiends, which you've encountered, and ice

2013
01:59:22,609 --> 01:59:27,588
devils. And they are the greatest of the devils
below the archdevils. Then you have lesser devils,

2014
01:59:27,588 --> 01:59:33,567
which are like imps, spine devils, bearded devils,
barbed devils, chain devils, bone devils. You've

2015
01:59:33,567 --> 01:59:36,722
got all these names, you get some drawings and
sketches of some of these creatures, and they all

2016
01:59:36,722 --> 01:59:49,221
look awful. Lowest in this rank are lemures.
Lemures are the souls of people that have passed,

2017
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:56,062
who have either done enough evil deeds that they
fall under the sway of one of the archdevils. Most

2018
01:59:56,062 --> 02:00:01,149
of them are acquired by making a deal with a
devil. A contract. They're big into contracts.

2019
02:00:01,209 --> 02:00:07,339
Their power structure is based on what sort of
souls, what power they can gain, what people they

2020
02:00:07,339 --> 02:00:10,653
can sway, what people they can convince to--

2021
02:00:10,726 --> 02:00:13,153
TALIESIN: Lemures are infernal Pokemon, is
basically what you're getting to.

2022
02:00:13,153 --> 02:00:17,766
MATT: Yeah. Once a soul has come under the sway of
a devil and is brought to the Nine Hells, it

2023
02:00:17,766 --> 02:00:26,215
either can become just a lost wandering soul used
as a source of energy; most of them convert into

2024
02:00:26,215 --> 02:00:33,278
lemures which are the low-level slaves. They're
ever-tortured, flesh masses that--

2025
02:00:33,278 --> 02:00:34,598
TALIESIN: So like The Scream?

2026
02:00:34,598 --> 02:00:35,628
MATT: Yeah.

2027
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:43,267
They're the tortured souls of the Nine
Hells. If a lemure does manage to do good enough

2028
02:00:43,317 --> 02:00:50,866
work over an extended period of time it can ascend
into a lesser devil, by pleasing its masters, by

2029
02:00:50,915 --> 02:00:56,616
whatever it may be. There is a chance, that's how
devils ascending are brought to a higher station.

2030
02:00:56,616 --> 02:00:57,939
TALIESIN: There's a few that have crawled their
way up.

2031
02:00:57,939 --> 02:01:01,789
MATT: Yeah, and the pit fiend you killed probably
returned and got demoted.

2032
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:07,040
LAURA: Ooh, to a lesser? Like they get turned into
something smaller?

2033
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,138
MATT: If something really powerful and cool that
was given a station was suddenly walking through

2034
02:01:10,138 --> 02:01:13,327
the street and killed by a bunch of people in the
city and came back and was like, "they killed me,"

2035
02:01:13,327 --> 02:01:17,949
they'd be like, "you're weak obviously". Reading
the structure, you probably really ruined that

2036
02:01:17,949 --> 02:01:19,841
guy's day. (laughs)

2037
02:01:19,841 --> 02:01:24,255
TALIESIN: He's probably going to have centuries
getting his shit back together. He's probably

2038
02:01:24,255 --> 02:01:25,587
really pissed.

2039
02:01:25,587 --> 02:01:30,093
MATT: Yeah, you basically made him lose his house,
and his dog, and his wife. You turned him into a

2040
02:01:30,093 --> 02:01:31,608
country song.

2041
02:01:31,608 --> 02:01:34,201
TALIESIN: Do they talk about anything like the
children that we saved?

2042
02:01:34,201 --> 02:01:40,858
The effect of angelic, angelic, why
those little angel children--

2043
02:01:40,907 --> 02:01:45,650
MATT: There is very little talk about celestial
blood, divas, other than the fact that there's been

2044
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:53,401
a long-standing battle since the founding. Since
the prime gods and betrayer gods divided early in

2045
02:01:53,401 --> 02:01:55,279
the creation of Exandria and--

2046
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:57,812
TALIESIN: There's no talk about using celestial
power as some sort of weapon

2047
02:01:57,812 --> 02:02:00,825
against these creatures.

2048
02:02:00,825 --> 02:02:07,110
MATT: Not celestial power necessarily, but some of
the entities are susceptible to various divine

2049
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:14,689
magics and abilities, and that is a strong back
and forth between the two sides. The big war is

2050
02:02:14,689 --> 02:02:23,137
between the devils and the demons. The Abyss,
which is the nature of chaos and evil and driven

2051
02:02:23,137 --> 02:02:31,556
hunger at whatever cost, versus the power-hungry
devils, which build structure, dominance,

2052
02:02:31,556 --> 02:02:38,688
expanding their territory, and ruling through
structure and power.

2053
02:02:38,688 --> 02:02:43,344
TALIESIN: Okay, so within evil, there is chaos
versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil.

2054
02:02:43,344 --> 02:02:45,293
MATT: Yes, those are the two sides, devils versus
demons.

2055
02:02:45,293 --> 02:02:47,273
TALIESIN: All right. This is all very useful.

2056
02:02:47,273 --> 02:02:50,699
MATT: But there are many tiers of the hells and
nine--

2057
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:56,398
MARISHA: Does it mention any Abyssal fiends that
they particularly hate

2058
02:02:56,398 --> 02:02:59,966
that we might have encountered?

2059
02:02:59,966 --> 02:03:02,611
TALIESIN: Flipping. I'm just going to keep
skimming.

2060
02:03:02,611 --> 02:03:05,513
LIAM: While he's skimming could we jump back for
just thirty seconds?

2061
02:03:05,513 --> 02:03:06,538
MATT: Sure.

2062
02:03:06,538 --> 02:03:08,408
TALIESIN: Actually I'm happy to time-pass and
we'll revamp that.

2063
02:03:08,408 --> 02:03:10,737
MATT: I just want to make sure that we don't get
lost on this somewhere.

2064
02:03:10,737 --> 02:03:14,789
LIAM: Just 30 seconds before we go in, I'm like I
should have the book. I'll carry the book in, give

2065
02:03:14,789 --> 02:03:16,220
me the book.

2066
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,842
LAURA: I thought you took the book.

2067
02:03:17,842 --> 02:03:20,120
LIAM: I don't carry books.

2068
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,077
LAURA: No, you have the book. I thought you were
lying to the guy.

2069
02:03:22,077 --> 02:03:25,205
You actually have the book, right?

2070
02:03:25,205 --> 02:03:27,091
LIAM: You took the book when we left--

2071
02:03:27,091 --> 02:03:29,516
LAURA: I didn't take the book, I thought you took
the book.

2072
02:03:29,516 --> 02:03:30,586
LIAM: Are you fucking kidding me?

2073
02:03:30,586 --> 02:03:32,160
LAURA: Are you fucking serious?

2074
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,942
LIAM: Fuck.

2075
02:03:33,942 --> 02:03:36,784
TALIESIN: Can we direct people to the Benny Hill
steampunk theme song.

2076
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:38,173
MARISHA: (sings Yakety Sax)

2077
02:03:38,173 --> 02:03:39,632
LAURA: Let's go to the library.

2078
02:03:39,632 --> 02:03:41,259
MATT: All right, meanwhile.

2079
02:03:41,259 --> 02:03:46,229
MARISHA: So were we supposed to take the book? Or
were they supposed to take the book?

2080
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:47,956
TALIESIN: I thought you said that we were taking
the book.

2081
02:03:47,956 --> 02:03:51,172
MARISHA: Well, I also thought we were going to the
Reserve and now we're in the library.

2082
02:03:51,172 --> 02:03:53,113
MATT: Are you unveiling the book?

2083
02:03:53,113 --> 02:03:54,822
TALIESIN: No, we are not. We have it, we have not
unveiled it.

2084
02:03:54,822 --> 02:03:56,034
LAURA: We're heading to the library.

2085
02:03:56,034 --> 02:03:57,009
MATT: Okay.

2086
02:03:57,009 --> 02:03:59,702
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep reading while they
head, you guys if you want to--

2087
02:03:59,702 --> 02:04:02,181
MARISHA: I'm so confused on our plan.

2088
02:04:02,252 --> 02:04:07,925
MATT: There are many things you learn. One, the
first layer of Avernus, which is the first layer

2089
02:04:07,999 --> 02:04:16,214
of the hell. It is a terrible blackened rocky
wasteland, rivers of blood. It's a bad place.

2090
02:04:16,214 --> 02:04:19,710
Usually, you have to travel from each layer into
the next one. There are very few portals that'll

2091
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:25,965
lead to the Hells. Usually, any that do start at
Inverness and you have to work your way in. That

2092
02:04:26,017 --> 02:04:34,640
area is ruled by Zariel, which is the Archduchess
of Avernus. This is also the realm of Tiamat.

2093
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:37,793
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah, okay!

2094
02:04:37,793 --> 02:04:40,378
MATT: You glancing through and trying to find
things that catch your attention. This is a large

2095
02:04:40,378 --> 02:04:42,489
tome. You could spend days and
days researching this but you don't have a lot of

2096
02:04:42,489 --> 02:04:47,926
time. You are looking for specific things. Dis is
the second layer of the Nine Hells. It is a

2097
02:04:47,926 --> 02:04:53,367
labyrinth of canyons, wedged between sheer
mountains, filled with iron ore. There are iron

2098
02:04:53,367 --> 02:04:57,902
roads that span through the canyons with a series
of bridges that lead over these giant crevasses

2099
02:04:57,902 --> 02:05:07,259
and this dark landscape. The ruler of the second
layer and the lord currently is Dispater.

2100
02:05:07,259 --> 02:05:08,345
TRAVIS: Dispater?

2101
02:05:08,345 --> 02:05:09,660
MATT: Yes. Dispater, which is--

2102
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,862
LAURA: Similar to James Spader.

2103
02:05:10,862 --> 02:05:11,609
LIAM: Yeah.

2104
02:05:11,609 --> 02:05:12,895
(all laugh)

2105
02:05:12,895 --> 02:05:17,454
MATT: Yeah. Just half-cousin. Talks kind of like
him, too, it's really creepy.

2106
02:05:17,454 --> 02:05:19,957
MARISHA: So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader
is--

2107
02:05:19,957 --> 02:05:21,225
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Dispater.

2108
02:05:21,225 --> 02:05:22,337
MATT: Yeah.

2109
02:05:22,337 --> 02:05:23,395
TALIESIN: They're not that clever.

2110
02:05:23,395 --> 02:05:28,361
MARISHA: And the first layer of Hell is also
referred to as the layer of Inyimenemo-- what?

2111
02:05:28,361 --> 02:05:29,311
MATT: Avernus.

2112
02:05:29,311 --> 02:05:30,562
MARISHA: Avernus.

2113
02:05:30,562 --> 02:05:37,066
MATT: However, what does catch your attention
immediately is on Dis there is a city called the

2114
02:05:37,251 --> 02:05:49,275
Iron City of Dis that is a massive metropolis,
primarily where most extra-planar entities travel

2115
02:05:49,275 --> 02:05:54,719
to do business. It is in many cases an open
market.

2116
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:56,954
TALIESIN: So, probably safer.

2117
02:05:56,954 --> 02:06:04,097
MATT: It's one of the safer areas for a mortal to
walk through, comparatively-- it's still in one of

2118
02:06:04,097 --> 02:06:10,099
the Hells. But because it is such a center for
business, it's a popular location for extra-planar

2119
02:06:10,099 --> 02:06:16,829
travelers, it's a popular place for succubi,
incubi to travel, it's a popular place for

2120
02:06:16,829 --> 02:06:27,988
rakshasas. It specifically brings up hags,
creatures that deal in business, deal in

2121
02:06:27,988 --> 02:06:34,589
exchanges, deal in contracts. Beyond the usual
devil ones, a lot of them tend to go to the Iron

2122
02:06:34,589 --> 02:06:35,962
City of Dis.

2123
02:06:35,962 --> 02:06:39,316
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm marking that-- I'm putting a
pin on my Pinterest board.

2124
02:06:39,316 --> 02:06:42,288
MARISHA: Atlas Obscura that shit.

2125
02:06:42,288 --> 02:06:47,300
TALIESIN: Atlas Obscura the hell out of the City
of Dis.

2126
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:50,614
MATT: I can give you the rest of this to read on
the break, if you'd like because it's a lot of

2127
02:06:50,614 --> 02:06:53,942
information, but that's the one that sticks out to
you.

2128
02:06:53,942 --> 02:06:55,743
TALIESIN: I don't want to kill Travis.

2129
02:06:55,743 --> 02:07:03,918
MATT: No. In looking specifically for the mention
of rakshasas, there are sections about the

2130
02:07:03,918 --> 02:07:13,095
creatures and talking about their history and how
they originally stemmed from the Hells and burst

2131
02:07:13,095 --> 02:07:18,527
out of the prime plane. It goes into their history
there, the rest of it doesn't have as much in

2132
02:07:18,527 --> 02:07:22,288
correlation to where you would look for such a
creature. They do exist on

2133
02:07:22,288 --> 02:07:24,115
multiple layers of the Hells.

2134
02:07:24,115 --> 02:07:25,697
TALIESIN: City of Dis seems to be the winner.

2135
02:07:25,697 --> 02:07:27,959
MATT: At the very least, a place where you can get
information that can lead you elsewhere.

2136
02:07:27,959 --> 02:07:29,377
TALIESIN: I'm very excited.

2137
02:07:29,377 --> 02:07:31,083
MARISHA: Any information on how to get there?

2138
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:33,764
LAURA and LIAM: (sing) We built Dis city on--

2139
02:07:33,764 --> 02:07:36,158
TALIESIN: Inter-planar travel.

2140
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:41,773
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift there. I do a very
detailed look at what the

2141
02:07:41,773 --> 02:07:44,483
Iron City of Dis seems like--

2142
02:07:44,483 --> 02:07:46,689
TALIESIN: I'll sketch a little bit of it out of
the book, as well.

2143
02:07:46,689 --> 02:07:53,467
MATT: Okay, cool. And there are some descriptors
in there, some mild sketches. One thing it does

2144
02:07:53,467 --> 02:08:01,398
speak of is the Tower. The Iron Tower of Dispater
which is, essentially, this massive central

2145
02:08:01,398 --> 02:08:08,303
structure to the city where the actual archdevil
himself looks down upon the city and keeps watch

2146
02:08:08,303 --> 02:08:11,380
over most business that he can.

2147
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,854
LIAM: Great stealth roll.

2148
02:08:12,854 --> 02:08:14,386
MATT: Good job, thank you.

2149
02:08:14,386 --> 02:08:16,364
(all laugh)

2150
02:08:16,364 --> 02:08:17,383
TALIESIN: Dagger, dagger.

2151
02:08:17,383 --> 02:08:19,191
LIAM: Thank you.

2152
02:08:19,191 --> 02:08:23,080
MATT: While you guys are completing your
research-- Taryon and Grog!

2153
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:26,696
What are you guys doing?

2154
02:08:26,696 --> 02:08:29,161
SAM: Do you have the book?

2155
02:08:29,161 --> 02:08:32,768
(all laugh)

2156
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,105
TRAVIS: Which book?

2157
02:08:34,105 --> 02:08:37,792
SAM: Never mind. Let's go find a place to buy some
potions.

2158
02:08:37,792 --> 02:08:41,608
TRAVIS: All right. Are you accustomed to buying
things?

2159
02:08:41,608 --> 02:08:43,076
SAM: Very much so.

2160
02:08:43,076 --> 02:08:45,993
TRAVIS: Oh. Do you have a personal shopper?

2161
02:08:45,993 --> 02:08:48,095
SAM: I actually do, yes.

2162
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:50,540
TRAVIS: Nice. Well, show me how it's done.

2163
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:54,064
SAM: All right, I'll take you under my wing, so to
speak.

2164
02:08:54,064 --> 02:08:57,460
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a bit big so I don't know how
you're going to do that.

2165
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,504
SAM: Doty, join us!

2166
02:09:01,704 --> 02:09:09,097
MATT: And as you guys walk through the streets,
everyone stares. Partially because you are a

2167
02:09:09,097 --> 02:09:19,055
bright shiny beacon of finely polished gems and
armor flanked by a massive bearded goliath and

2168
02:09:19,055 --> 02:09:22,283
whatever the fuck Doty is.

2169
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:28,828
SAM: Hello, hi, greetings, good day, good
afternoon, don't mind them, they're my friends!

2170
02:09:28,828 --> 02:09:31,455
Hahahaha!

2171
02:09:31,455 --> 02:09:33,789
TRAVIS: Wow.

2172
02:09:33,789 --> 02:09:39,192
MATT: About five minutes of walking before two
armored Bastions come up in their piecemeal

2173
02:09:39,192 --> 02:09:45,029
leather and scale breastplate armor with their
heavy fur cloaks over their shoulders, holding

2174
02:09:45,029 --> 02:09:47,766
spears. "You!"

2175
02:09:47,766 --> 02:09:49,334
SAM: Uh!

2176
02:09:49,334 --> 02:09:54,304
MATT: "You walk with strange company. What's your
business here in Vasselheim?"

2177
02:09:54,304 --> 02:10:09,597
SAM: We are wandering merchants, trying to find
some textiles to buy to resell in other lands.

2178
02:10:09,597 --> 02:10:17,386
That's all. Don't mind my traveling companions.
They're my protectors. I travel as a merchant with

2179
02:10:17,386 --> 02:10:30,394
a lot of coin, so I found these two at a leper
colony and nursed them back to health. It was also

2180
02:10:30,394 --> 02:10:42,594
a gym, a muscle-man place, so they're really buff.
But they're also lepers. And that explains their

2181
02:10:42,594 --> 02:10:44,648
matted hair.

2182
02:10:44,648 --> 02:10:47,755
MATT: Make a deception check, please.

2183
02:10:47,755 --> 02:10:51,425
TALIESIN: You get to experience this as a normal
person now. I'm so excited.

2184
02:10:51,425 --> 02:10:53,102
SAM: What, deception?

2185
02:10:53,102 --> 02:10:53,932
MATT: Yeah.

2186
02:10:53,932 --> 02:10:57,872
SAM: Ooh, I better use Luck. Ooh, no, that's
worse.

2187
02:10:57,934 --> 02:11:00,073
(all laugh)

2188
02:11:00,073 --> 02:11:03,570
SAM: So do I use the higher one, or just the
second one?

2189
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:06,407
MATT: I'll double check.

2190
02:11:06,407 --> 02:11:10,623
LAURA: I think you have to use the second roll.

2191
02:11:10,684 --> 02:11:12,884
SAM: Well, it don't matter.

2192
02:11:12,933 --> 02:11:14,822
MATT: You choose.

2193
02:11:14,822 --> 02:11:16,630
SAM: Okay, ten.

2194
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:20,281
MATT: Total of ten.

2195
02:11:20,281 --> 02:11:22,376
SAM: Yeah.

2196
02:11:22,376 --> 02:11:32,735
MATT: He leans in real fast. "Oh wow, that's got
to be unfortunate. Being so buff and so filled

2197
02:11:32,735 --> 02:11:35,410
"with leprosy."

2198
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:46,202
SAM: It is their cross to bear. That's why this
one doesn't even talk, and this one is a leper of

2199
02:11:46,202 --> 02:11:49,974
few words.

2200
02:11:50,702 --> 02:11:55,927
MATT: He leans back, and the two guards watch you
and nod and step back

2201
02:11:55,927 --> 02:11:57,602
to let you continue to pass.

2202
02:11:57,602 --> 02:12:07,844
SAM: Thank you. Might I inquire from you fine
gentleman where we might find some medicine or

2203
02:12:07,844 --> 02:12:19,137
healing potions? These lepers are set to relapse.
That way? All right. I'll head that way then. Good

2204
02:12:19,137 --> 02:12:24,061
day to you. Keep warm.

2205
02:12:24,061 --> 02:12:27,727
MATT: As you guys keep walking, they slowly close
behind you and just begin to follow from about 30

2206
02:12:27,727 --> 02:12:29,011
feet back.

2207
02:12:29,011 --> 02:12:31,866
TRAVIS: That was amazing. Have you ever lied to
anybody before?

2208
02:12:31,866 --> 02:12:40,603
SAM: Never. I think I have a talent for it though.
I just felt the words coming out and I went with it.

2209
02:12:40,603 --> 02:12:42,448
TRAVIS: It was a thrill, right?

2210
02:12:42,448 --> 02:12:48,204
SAM: It was thrilling. It was exciting. And they
were going with it. They were eating it up. I had

2211
02:12:48,204 --> 02:12:53,636
them right where I wanted them. I could've told
them fucking anything. It was great, right?

2212
02:12:53,636 --> 02:12:54,879
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2213
02:12:54,879 --> 02:12:55,981
SAM: Wow.

2214
02:12:55,981 --> 02:12:58,222
TRAVIS: On a scale from one to two, how do you
think it went?

2215
02:12:58,222 --> 02:13:02,452
SAM: I mean, two's the higher of the two, right?
Oh, you don't know.

2216
02:13:02,452 --> 02:13:06,161
(all laugh)

2217
02:13:06,161 --> 02:13:07,684
SAM: I feel good.

2218
02:13:07,684 --> 02:13:09,127
TRAVIS: Nice, yeah.

2219
02:13:09,127 --> 02:13:13,407
SAM: Now, remember, if anyone asks you, just go
(moans in pain) "I'm a leper",

2220
02:13:13,407 --> 02:13:15,157
or something like that.

2221
02:13:15,157 --> 02:13:16,864
TRAVIS: (moans in pain) I'm a leper.

2222
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:17,917
SAM: That's good.

2223
02:13:17,917 --> 02:13:20,563
TRAVIS: Yeah, good. Are they following us now?

2224
02:13:20,563 --> 02:13:22,768
SAM: Oh, I hadn't looked.

2225
02:13:22,768 --> 02:13:27,040
MATT: You turn around, right at them, and 30 feet
back they're walking and

2226
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,661
they just stop as you stop.

2227
02:13:29,661 --> 02:13:31,237
TRAVIS: Still think it went well?

2228
02:13:31,237 --> 02:13:33,555
SAM: (whispers) I think they're following us.

2229
02:13:33,555 --> 02:13:34,790
TRAVIS: Really?

2230
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:35,875
SAM: What do we do?

2231
02:13:35,875 --> 02:13:40,340
TRAVIS: You know, it was probably you told such a
good story, they're just fascinated by you now.

2232
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:42,893
SAM: What do I do? I've never been followed by
guards before.

2233
02:13:42,893 --> 02:13:47,199
TRAVIS: You should probably act casual. Or you
could drop some money on the ground, and let all

2234
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:50,925
the people run and collect it, and make a
diversion. It's up to you.

2235
02:13:50,925 --> 02:13:52,951
SAM: Are there people around?

2236
02:13:52,951 --> 02:13:54,981
MATT: There's a few.

2237
02:13:54,981 --> 02:13:59,365
TRAVIS: Just dump all your money on the ground.
They'll come out of the houses, the woodworks.

2238
02:13:59,365 --> 02:14:06,875
SAM: I was warned about you and money. I won't
listen to that. But I will try to act casual. I

2239
02:14:06,875 --> 02:14:16,366
will just take off my gigantic, diamond-encrusted
helmet. Let my hair down.

2240
02:14:16,366 --> 02:14:18,611
TRAVIS: How long is his long, blonde hair?

2241
02:14:18,611 --> 02:14:21,047
MATT: Just past the shoulders.

2242
02:14:21,047 --> 02:14:23,809
TRAVIS: Just free-flowing? No fancy braids or buns
or anything?

2243
02:14:23,809 --> 02:14:27,271
MATT: No, just free-flowing, perfectly arced in
the front, except pulled back because of the

2244
02:14:27,271 --> 02:14:32,617
helmet. It's glorious. It's Bee Gee-tastic.

2245
02:14:32,679 --> 02:14:34,961
SAM: (loudly) Ah, what a day, am I right?

2246
02:14:34,961 --> 02:14:36,770
TRAVIS: You're talking real loud.

2247
02:14:36,770 --> 02:14:38,175
SAM: (softly) That's what casual people do.

2248
02:14:38,175 --> 02:14:39,201
TRAVIS: No. They don't.

2249
02:14:39,201 --> 02:14:40,368
SAM: They don't care what people think.

2250
02:14:40,368 --> 02:14:41,870
TRAVIS: Volume control, real important.

2251
02:14:41,870 --> 02:14:48,437
SAM: Okay. (loudly) Ah, just want to take a load
off and just rest here for a while. Not going

2252
02:14:48,437 --> 02:14:54,001
anywhere, just sitting here and acting real
boring, right?

2253
02:14:54,001 --> 02:14:58,851
TRAVIS: Yep. How are we going to stay here and
find the health potions at the same time?

2254
02:14:58,851 --> 02:15:01,054
SAM: Guide me. You've been doing this longer.

2255
02:15:01,054 --> 02:15:06,247
TRAVIS: No, you're really doing well. I'm learning
a lot right now. Clearly, you are a well-traveled

2256
02:15:06,247 --> 02:15:07,819
man of mystery.

2257
02:15:07,819 --> 02:15:15,143
SAM: All right, I've read about situations like
this, right? We just need to create a diversion.

2258
02:15:15,143 --> 02:15:18,452
While the guards are diverted, we run away, fast
as we can, right?

2259
02:15:18,452 --> 02:15:20,718
TRAVIS: I literally told you about that one minute
ago.

2260
02:15:20,718 --> 02:15:21,480
SAM: Yes.

2261
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:25,659
(all laugh)

2262
02:15:25,659 --> 02:15:27,512
SAM: Here's my plan.

2263
02:15:27,512 --> 02:15:30,020
MATT: Grog, make a perception check.

2264
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,800
TRAVIS: 15.

2265
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:40,355
MATT: You're getting close to the exterior of the
building pointed to by the guards, and you

2266
02:15:40,355 --> 02:15:43,947
recognize it. It's the place where you've
previously purchased potions.

2267
02:15:44,975 --> 02:15:50,023
TRAVIS: Look, I hate to interrupt, right. Do you
think you've done anything wrong?

2268
02:15:50,023 --> 02:15:51,013
SAM: Illegal?

2269
02:15:51,013 --> 02:15:52,762
TRAVIS: Yeah. Have you done anything wrong?

2270
02:15:52,762 --> 02:15:54,097
SAM: I don't think so, no.

2271
02:15:54,097 --> 02:15:55,620
TRAVIS: You've never been here before?

2272
02:15:55,620 --> 02:16:00,527
SAM: Well, we are traveling around with an arcane
being. I don't know if that's illegal.

2273
02:16:00,527 --> 02:16:06,287
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's totally fine. Look, this place
is where the goods are.

2274
02:16:06,287 --> 02:16:10,011
SAM: You mean potions and magical items?

2275
02:16:10,011 --> 02:16:14,979
TRAVIS: All sorts of stuff. I don't even know if
his inventory has improved since we've last been

2276
02:16:14,979 --> 02:16:20,012
here, but he will give you a really great deal,
and it'll give you a chance to prove to me how

2277
02:16:20,012 --> 02:16:22,563
good of a salesman you are.

2278
02:16:22,563 --> 02:16:26,836
SAM: All right. But how do we shake the
uards-gay?

2279
02:16:26,836 --> 02:16:28,194
TRAVIS: What?

2280
02:16:28,194 --> 02:16:34,788
SAM: Well, that came out weird. Didn't think that
through.

2281
02:16:34,788 --> 02:16:44,942
(all laugh)

2282
02:16:44,942 --> 02:16:50,818
TRAVIS: I mean, the motherfucking pig-latin.
Jesus.

2283
02:16:50,818 --> 02:16:58,062
SAM: What they do in the comfort of their own home
is their own--

2284
02:16:58,062 --> 02:17:05,693
TRAVIS: I don't think there's any shaking them,
right. Why don't you leave old twinkle-toes

2285
02:17:05,693 --> 02:17:12,241
outside, and we go in? Surely Doty can read or
something?

2286
02:17:12,241 --> 02:17:16,483
SAM: He can stay here and keep watch, but if they
ask him anything, he will be--

2287
02:17:16,483 --> 02:17:18,191
TRAVIS: Mute.

2288
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:20,249
SAM: Is that all right, do you think?

2289
02:17:20,249 --> 02:17:21,703
TRAVIS: What's wrong with that?

2290
02:17:21,703 --> 02:17:22,871
SAM: All right.

2291
02:17:22,871 --> 02:17:26,939
TRAVIS: Maybe just tell him to be cool.

2292
02:17:26,939 --> 02:17:28,424
SAM: Doty.

2293
02:17:28,424 --> 02:17:32,860
MATT: Which, as you turn, you see he's been
drawing in his book the entire time, everything

2294
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:35,504
you guys have been discussing.

2295
02:17:35,504 --> 02:17:44,844
SAM: Doty. Act cool. That means book down, don't
say a word, and if the guards get close, let us

2296
02:17:44,844 --> 02:17:56,843
know with some sort of sound. Thank you. Remember,
you're a leper, so seem unhealthy.

2297
02:17:56,843 --> 02:18:03,962
MATT: (lopsided mechanical footsteps) Horrible
creaking sounds.

2298
02:18:03,962 --> 02:18:06,118
SAM: Good. All right, let's go inside.

2299
02:18:06,118 --> 02:18:07,385
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2300
02:18:07,385 --> 02:18:11,289
MATT: So, the guards are closing the gap a little
bit. You guys pick up pace, they pick up pace a

2301
02:18:11,289 --> 02:18:15,885
little bit. You get to the outside of the
building. The doors are closed. You open them and

2302
02:18:15,885 --> 02:18:21,191
get inside. The warm interior is lit up. You can
see there's nobody else currently inside, except

2303
02:18:21,191 --> 02:18:27,292
for your old friend, the potion-seller, who's
currently reading what looks to be some sort of

2304
02:18:27,292 --> 02:18:32,495
a-- you're not actually sure what's inside the
book, but it's a small, handheld book, and he's

2305
02:18:32,495 --> 02:18:36,999
reading through, bored. "No. No. No."

2306
02:18:36,999 --> 02:18:45,586
TRAVIS: No, no. She's not here. It's just me and
my new, rich friend. Rich.

2307
02:18:45,586 --> 02:18:48,470
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2308
02:18:49,137 --> 02:18:51,891
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2309
02:18:51,891 --> 02:18:53,034
MARISHA: Are you serious?

2310
02:18:53,034 --> 02:18:55,454
TRAVIS: That's what it says.

2311
02:18:55,702 --> 02:18:58,255
MATT: "She's not here?"

2312
02:18:58,255 --> 02:19:00,651
TRAVIS: She's not here. It's just the two of us.

2313
02:19:00,651 --> 02:19:02,103
MATT: "And your friend's very rich?"

2314
02:19:02,103 --> 02:19:03,201
SAM: Extremely.

2315
02:19:03,201 --> 02:19:06,929
TRAVIS: Do you see what he is covered in?

2316
02:19:06,929 --> 02:19:10,656
MATT: "What is that?"

2317
02:19:10,656 --> 02:19:13,812
SAM: Just outside the door there?

2318
02:19:13,812 --> 02:19:16,635
MATT: "Yes."

2319
02:19:16,635 --> 02:19:19,057
SAM: He's a man.

2320
02:19:19,057 --> 02:19:20,097
MATT: "Great. Well then."

2321
02:19:20,097 --> 02:19:25,140
(all laugh)

2322
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:29,555
TRAVIS: Nice. Slick.

2323
02:19:29,555 --> 02:19:33,202
MATT: "So what can I get you? I've got all sorts
of salves and spices. We've got all sorts of

2324
02:19:33,266 --> 02:19:35,793
"incense. What are you looking for?"

2325
02:19:35,793 --> 02:19:40,297
TRAVIS: Inside the shop, has it grown or become
more ornate since we've last been here?

2326
02:19:40,297 --> 02:19:44,283
MATT: It does, actually. Last time you were here
it was in the process of being put together. The

2327
02:19:44,283 --> 02:19:50,448
shop seems to be fully open now and outfitted,
though it doesn't seem to be getting much traffic,

2328
02:19:50,448 --> 02:19:59,506
as it is very empy. So he seems eager he has
customers. And now much more put at ease, now that

2329
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:04,902
you've let him know that from his vision, the
dragon woman did not come with you.

2330
02:20:04,902 --> 02:20:10,542
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) You first.

2331
02:20:10,542 --> 02:20:19,532
SAM: Oh, for myself, do you have any spell
scrolls, or any sort of one-use items that I could

2332
02:20:19,532 --> 02:20:27,465
use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps?

2333
02:20:27,465 --> 02:20:31,441
MATT: "Let me see what I've got."

2334
02:20:31,441 --> 02:20:35,743
SAM: Things that could deceive, things that could
use force against--

2335
02:20:35,743 --> 02:20:48,773
MATT: And he rummages through a couple of scroll
pieces. Let's see here what he might have. "I do,

2336
02:20:48,773 --> 02:20:58,652
"should you be so interested, currently carry one
scroll that would surround with you a wreath of

2337
02:20:58,652 --> 02:21:00,645
"dangerous fire."

2338
02:21:00,645 --> 02:21:06,760
SAM: Oh, all right. Just around me, or around an
area?

2339
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:11,698
MATT: "Just around you. Anything that came too
close would burst into flames and be burned."

2340
02:21:11,698 --> 02:21:17,877
SAM: I have 13 of those right here. Do you have
anything else?

2341
02:21:21,529 --> 02:21:22,983
TRAVIS: Not that that's not really impressive.

2342
02:21:23,033 --> 02:21:24,428
SAM: It's really good.

2343
02:21:24,428 --> 02:21:26,786
MATT: "I've got something that makes you jump."

2344
02:21:26,786 --> 02:21:28,773
SAM: I've got that.

2345
02:21:28,773 --> 02:21:30,838
MATT: "I've got something that makes you see in
the dark."

2346
02:21:30,838 --> 02:21:32,956
SAM: Yeah, I have a light already.

2347
02:21:32,956 --> 02:21:36,950
(all laugh)

2348
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:40,060
MATT: "What do you want?"

2349
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:45,180
SAM: All right, give me that one scroll, the fire
scroll. I could sell it and get something else.

2350
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:47,697
MATT: "All right."

2351
02:21:47,697 --> 02:21:49,323
SAM: How much is that?

2352
02:21:49,323 --> 02:21:52,911
MATT: I'm looking right now for the scroll that's
here.

2353
02:21:52,911 --> 02:21:55,298
TRAVIS: You have to read the scroll, right?

2354
02:21:55,298 --> 02:22:03,322
SAM: I could read it to you. If that's what you're
asking.

2355
02:22:03,322 --> 02:22:10,490
MATT: He looks you over. "The scroll I would put
at a fair 6,000 gold pieces."

2356
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:19,745
SAM: (gulps) Watch how it's done. I'm going to put
an amount of gold on the table. I'd like you to

2357
02:22:19,745 --> 02:22:29,609
consider it, and if it's to your liking, take it,
and if not, just shake your head. And I'll put 200

2358
02:22:29,609 --> 02:22:56,710
gold on the table. I'll put 200 more. I'll put
2,000 more. And another 2,000.

2359
02:22:56,710 --> 02:22:59,082
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2360
02:22:59,082 --> 02:23:00,591
TRAVIS: 4,400.

2361
02:23:00,591 --> 02:23:04,624
SAM: 17. Plus seven! 24.

2362
02:23:07,905 --> 02:23:10,621
MATT: Takes the gold.

2363
02:23:10,621 --> 02:23:13,022
TRAVIS: Wow!

2364
02:23:13,022 --> 02:23:15,330
SAM: Check and mate.

2365
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:17,526
TRAVIS: Check'n'mate?

2366
02:23:17,526 --> 02:23:19,310
MATT: You now have a scroll of fire shield.

2367
02:23:19,310 --> 02:23:24,432
SAM: Scroll of fire shield, excellent. I don't
know what that is.

2368
02:23:24,432 --> 02:23:30,034
TRAVIS: Wow. Do you have anything that makes you
faster?

2369
02:23:30,034 --> 02:23:32,361
MATT: "I said I have something that makes you
jump."

2370
02:23:32,361 --> 02:23:40,778
TRAVIS: No. I'm pretty good at jumping. What about
regular healing potions?

2371
02:23:40,778 --> 02:23:47,051
MATT: "That I've got! You cleared me out of my
other various vials last time."

2372
02:23:47,102 --> 02:23:49,201
TRAVIS: No new exotics came in?

2373
02:23:49,201 --> 02:23:54,285
MATT: "No, I'm waiting on-- Trade's been a little
slow. Looks like things are getting up in Emon, so

2374
02:23:54,285 --> 02:23:58,781
"hopefully we'll have more soon. But for the time
being, I do have some more healing potions." And

2375
02:23:58,781 --> 02:24:02,404
he goes into the back room, and you hear him
rummaging for a minute. You hear one crate fall

2376
02:24:02,404 --> 02:24:06,483
over and a couple of things shatter. "Ah god
damn--". And eventually he comes back through the

2377
02:24:06,483 --> 02:24:11,295
door, and he's holding in his arms a few clusters
of various glass vials. Some of them have been

2378
02:24:11,295 --> 02:24:16,506
repurposed and taped at the top, but they're
functional. He sets them down on the counter. "All

2379
02:24:16,506 --> 02:24:31,219
"right. I have six potions of healing, and I have
three of greater healing, and one superior."

2380
02:24:31,219 --> 02:24:33,827
SAM: Do I know how much these things tend to
cost?

2381
02:24:33,827 --> 02:24:36,374
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2382
02:24:36,374 --> 02:24:41,408
SAM: Ooh! This is not a save.

2383
02:24:41,408 --> 02:24:45,373
MATT: Yes, just add your modifier.

2384
02:24:45,891 --> 02:24:47,891
SAM: 20!

2385
02:24:47,891 --> 02:24:55,420
MATT: Yes, actually. The healing potions
can range around 75 to 100 gold pieces generally.

2386
02:24:55,630 --> 02:25:06,434
The uncommon ones can range somewhere in the 500
gold pieces range. The superior, however, are much

2387
02:25:06,434 --> 02:25:11,583
rarer to come by, and the fact he even has one,
with how recently you guys cleared him out, it's

2388
02:25:11,583 --> 02:25:16,631
pretty decent. That one can run anywhere between
4,000-5,000 gold pieces.

2389
02:25:16,631 --> 02:25:19,324
SAM: And it's six, three, and one? Is that right?

2390
02:25:19,324 --> 02:25:22,240
MATT: Six, three, and one.

2391
02:25:22,698 --> 02:25:26,476
TRAVIS: Do you want to get them? It seems like you
got all the money in the world.

2392
02:25:26,476 --> 02:25:31,734
SAM: I can heal myself just fine, but I don't know
about your friends--

2393
02:25:31,734 --> 02:25:34,954
do they have healing abilities?

2394
02:25:34,954 --> 02:25:39,292
TRAVIS: No, not-- well they do, they touch you
with their hand and then like all of a sudden it

2395
02:25:39,292 --> 02:25:40,821
feels a bit better.

2396
02:25:40,821 --> 02:25:41,791
SAM: A bit better?

2397
02:25:41,791 --> 02:25:43,323
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't really know how that works.

2398
02:25:43,323 --> 02:25:45,548
SAM: But they use potions. I've seen them use
potions.

2399
02:25:45,548 --> 02:25:48,354
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm normally pouring them in their
mouths.

2400
02:25:48,919 --> 02:25:52,380
SAM: Do you think they would appreciate these?

2401
02:25:52,380 --> 02:26:01,274
TRAVIS: I don't know, I hadn't thought that far.
As a (mumbling) new member of Vox Machina--

2402
02:26:01,274 --> 02:26:02,860
SAM: What was that?

2403
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:07,542
TRAVIS: Bad allergies here. It could be like a
really great gift, you know?

2404
02:26:07,542 --> 02:26:10,379
Like Keyleth gave you.

2405
02:26:10,379 --> 02:26:12,109
SAM: -- welcome-me-to-the-gang gift.

2406
02:26:12,109 --> 02:26:14,001
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2407
02:26:14,001 --> 02:26:17,864
SAM: Do you gift-wrap, here, sir?

2408
02:26:17,864 --> 02:26:22,689
MATT: "For an additional charge, yes, of course, I
gift wrap!"

2409
02:26:22,689 --> 02:26:30,455
SAM: -- of course for an additional charge. What
if we took the whole lot of those for 6,000 gold?

2410
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:38,027
MATT: "The whole lot? For 6,000. I'm afraid that
is far under the price I'd be considering. Let me

2411
02:26:38,027 --> 02:26:47,222
"see here." And he does some kind of notations, and
he goes, "Hm. You seem, from our previous

2412
02:26:47,222 --> 02:26:52,521
"experience, to be quite the bargainer, my
friend."

2413
02:26:52,521 --> 02:26:54,419
TRAVIS: Yeah, the brains.

2414
02:26:54,419 --> 02:27:00,202
MATT: "How would you say to the fair price of
10,000 gold pieces for the batch?"

2415
02:27:02,263 --> 02:27:09,721
TRAVIS: Let me confer with my partner. (whispers)
How many on your hands is that? Yeah, no-- both

2416
02:27:09,721 --> 02:27:11,334
hands, how many?

2417
02:27:11,334 --> 02:27:12,520
SAM: All.

2418
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:13,612
TRAVIS: Two?

2419
02:27:13,612 --> 02:27:15,075
SAM: Oh. Wait.

2420
02:27:15,075 --> 02:27:18,714
(all laugh)

2421
02:27:18,714 --> 02:27:20,016
SAM: It's too much.

2422
02:27:20,016 --> 02:27:21,199
TRAVIS: Too much.

2423
02:27:21,199 --> 02:27:26,889
SAM: Yes. This man is insulting your intelligence,
and you should be very angry right now.

2424
02:27:28,847 --> 02:27:43,574
TRAVIS: How about 9,000 gold pieces?

2425
02:27:43,574 --> 02:27:53,484
MATT: "Mm, you drive a very hard bargain, my big
friend, however! Because it's you? Deal."

2426
02:27:53,484 --> 02:27:55,132
TRAVIS: Done! Pay the man.

2427
02:27:55,132 --> 02:28:03,431
SAM: I would object to this. This is coming out of
my purse, and I insist that you negotiate with me,

2428
02:28:03,431 --> 02:28:06,277
and not--

2429
02:28:06,277 --> 02:28:11,849
TRAVIS: Tary, this man drives a really well-known
establishment. If we leave here, after having

2430
02:28:11,849 --> 02:28:17,563
struck that bargain, and we don't pay? There will
be more guards outside.

2431
02:28:17,563 --> 02:28:27,479
SAM: (gulps) How about this. I can trade you
something worth far more than the extra 3,000 gold

2432
02:28:27,479 --> 02:28:31,210
this gentleman promised you.

2433
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:34,702
MATT: "What would this be?"

2434
02:28:34,702 --> 02:28:49,834
SAM: It's a rare egg. Magical in nature. It can
save a life, in any situation. And if you eat it

2435
02:28:49,834 --> 02:28:58,129
when you are nearly dead, you will go back into
battle with the strength and bravery of ten men,

2436
02:28:58,129 --> 02:29:02,156
and you will not rest until your foes are dead.

2437
02:29:03,722 --> 02:29:07,245
MATT: Make a persuasion check. This isn't
deception because you believe this

2438
02:29:07,245 --> 02:29:08,912
wholeheartedly.

2439
02:29:08,912 --> 02:29:13,026
SAM: Is this deception or persuasion?

2440
02:29:13,026 --> 02:29:14,525
MATT: This is persuasion.

2441
02:29:14,525 --> 02:29:16,142
SAM: 22.

2442
02:29:25,297 --> 02:29:36,237
MATT: "6,000 and the egg, you say? Very well." He
pushes the--

2443
02:29:36,237 --> 02:29:37,776
SAM: Gentle!

2444
02:29:37,776 --> 02:29:48,750
MATT: "I will be." He goes over and quickly
reaches over and grabs a thick towel-like pile of

2445
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:57,256
cloth, and wraps it up carefully. "Ooh." Sets it
down. "A pleasure doing business with you all."

2446
02:29:57,256 --> 02:30:00,640
SAM: Ah-ah-ah. The gift-wrapping?

2447
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:03,645
(all laugh)

2448
02:30:03,697 --> 02:30:10,087
MATT: "Terribly sorry. My apologies. I'll be right
to it." And he turns and leaves the room.

2449
02:30:10,087 --> 02:30:14,921
TRAVIS: Tary, that was a personal gift from me to
you.

2450
02:30:15,604 --> 02:30:22,496
SAM: I know, but we're partners, as you just said,
and I felt that you would approve of me doing so.

2451
02:30:23,113 --> 02:30:26,690
TRAVIS: I suppose I am a bit proud.

2452
02:30:27,707 --> 02:30:29,613
MATT: (loud clanging)

2453
02:30:29,613 --> 02:30:30,734
SAM: What was that?

2454
02:30:30,734 --> 02:30:32,075
MATT: You hear behind you guys in the doorway--

2455
02:30:32,075 --> 02:30:33,066
SAM: Oh shit. Oh shit.

2456
02:30:33,066 --> 02:30:35,936
MATT: -- some of the impacts of metal, rapidly and
heavily.

2457
02:30:35,936 --> 02:30:37,549
TRAVIS: What?

2458
02:30:37,549 --> 02:30:38,458
SAM: Sword!

2459
02:30:38,458 --> 02:30:39,664
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

2460
02:30:39,664 --> 02:30:46,585
MATT: You watch, (whoosh), whips into a longsword.
And you glance behind and you see, walking through

2461
02:30:46,585 --> 02:30:51,753
the doorway, the very heavy, hulking figure of
Doty, carrying two unconscious guards that are

2462
02:30:51,753 --> 02:30:53,387
hanging from his hands.

2463
02:30:53,387 --> 02:30:55,589
SAM: Oh shit.

2464
02:30:55,589 --> 02:31:04,486
TRAVIS: What did you do? Give me those! I punch
them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for

2465
02:31:04,486 --> 02:31:06,718
extra measure.

2466
02:31:07,818 --> 02:31:12,376
MATT: Okay. Both jaws are very broken.

2467
02:31:13,210 --> 02:31:16,841
TRAVIS: Your guy really did a number. Cool. Okay.

2468
02:31:16,841 --> 02:31:19,952
(all laugh)

2469
02:31:19,952 --> 02:31:23,538
TRAVIS: Everybody's going to die, all right? So
we're going to kill everyone that we see in the

2470
02:31:23,538 --> 02:31:24,565
next ten seconds.

2471
02:31:24,565 --> 02:31:25,956
SAM: Wait, we're killing them? Even the shop
owner?

2472
02:31:25,956 --> 02:31:27,270
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got to die.

2473
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:31,820
SAM: Oh shit. All right. Partners, right? I'll do
whatever you say.

2474
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:33,848
TRAVIS: Is there a counter in the shop?

2475
02:31:33,848 --> 02:31:35,950
MATT: Yeah, there's a counter in the front area.

2476
02:31:35,950 --> 02:31:37,199
TRAVIS: Is it wooden?

2477
02:31:37,199 --> 02:31:38,090
MATT: Yeah.

2478
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:39,142
TRAVIS: Can he see through the counter?

2479
02:31:39,142 --> 02:31:42,131
MATT: No, the proprietor is in the back room. He's
wrapping your stuff right now.

2480
02:31:42,131 --> 02:31:45,167
SAM: He doesn't know this happened. Let's get rid
of them. Get rid of them.

2481
02:31:45,167 --> 02:31:49,067
TRAVIS: Well, what's in the shop? Is there a
tapestry, is there a rug?

2482
02:31:49,067 --> 02:31:52,126
MATT: It's not a very big-- There is a secondary
room to the side where it looks like there is an

2483
02:31:52,126 --> 02:31:54,889
upper platform, but that looks like where his
bedroom is, maybe.

2484
02:31:54,889 --> 02:31:56,019
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2485
02:31:56,019 --> 02:31:58,668
MATT: There's a couple of lanterns, it's a
warm-lit interior, and as you're looking around,

2486
02:31:58,668 --> 02:32:03,243
it's not a huge establishment. Make a perception
check.

2487
02:32:05,908 --> 02:32:07,567
TRAVIS: Yeah. Two.

2488
02:32:07,567 --> 02:32:09,422
MATT: You have no idea! You're panicking.

2489
02:32:09,422 --> 02:32:12,762
TRAVIS: I saw this in a tavern once. Let's sit
them up like they're just sleeping

2490
02:32:12,762 --> 02:32:15,537
and nobody will notice.

2491
02:32:15,537 --> 02:32:20,043
SAM: They have jaws-- the blood! Their jaws are
terrible!

2492
02:32:20,043 --> 02:32:23,020
TRAVIS: Well, didn't you put a mask on Dotty?
Let's do it again.

2493
02:32:23,020 --> 02:32:25,010
SAM: I can't! I don't have extra masks.

2494
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:26,407
TRAVIS: No, it will be no problem.

2495
02:32:26,407 --> 02:32:28,416
SAM: We can put them somewhere else.

2496
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:32,355
TRAVIS: I sit one up in the corner, and I sit the
other one, and lean it on his shoulder.

2497
02:32:32,355 --> 02:32:34,645
MATT: Okay.

2498
02:32:34,934 --> 02:32:37,900
SAM: Oh my god. What?

2499
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:39,305
TRAVIS: This is great. Don't worry.

2500
02:32:39,305 --> 02:32:41,837
SAM: Even I can tell that those are two--

2501
02:32:41,837 --> 02:32:44,897
TRAVIS: I have an even better idea! I take the
cask of ale out of the bag of holding, and I just

2502
02:32:44,897 --> 02:32:47,614
start pouring ale all over them.

2503
02:32:47,614 --> 02:32:50,045
SAM: Why would they be in here drinking? They're
guards on duty!

2504
02:32:50,045 --> 02:32:53,589
TRAVIS: They're terrible guards. They make
horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line

2505
02:32:53,589 --> 02:32:58,944
of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in
their laps. Cool.

2506
02:32:58,944 --> 02:33:01,054
Now I need you to vomit on them.

2507
02:33:01,054 --> 02:33:03,258
SAM: I can't vomit.

2508
02:33:03,258 --> 02:33:06,675
TRAVIS: Do it right now. Put your finger down your
throat and puke on these guards.

2509
02:33:06,675 --> 02:33:09,171
MATT: Make an intimidation check, Grog.

2510
02:33:11,167 --> 02:33:14,002
TRAVIS: 17! Puke on those fucking guards!

2511
02:33:14,002 --> 02:33:14,919
SAM: What do I roll?

2512
02:33:14,919 --> 02:33:19,376
MATT: I'm going to say, make an insight check.
Sure.

2513
02:33:19,376 --> 02:33:21,166
SAM: 16.

2514
02:33:21,166 --> 02:33:26,208
TRAVIS: Vomit on those bitches.

2515
02:33:26,208 --> 02:33:31,375
SAM: (dry heaving)

2516
02:33:31,375 --> 02:33:33,337
MATT: And that's going to be giffed forever.

2517
02:33:33,337 --> 02:33:39,224
(all laugh)

2518
02:33:39,224 --> 02:33:43,485
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

2519
02:33:43,485 --> 02:33:46,168
SAM: Natural 20.

2520
02:33:46,168 --> 02:33:52,960
MATT: About 30 seconds of you trying to gag
yourself pass, before the shop owner comes back,

2521
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:58,427
with these beautifully packaged healing potions.
"All right, so--"

2522
02:33:58,427 --> 02:34:01,324
SAM: One second! One second.

2523
02:34:01,324 --> 02:34:06,551
TRAVIS: I'm really sorry. These two gentlemen
obviously have been off their ass. They came in

2524
02:34:06,551 --> 02:34:11,813
here, smelling of booze, looking for something to
make them feel better, I don't know, and they just

2525
02:34:11,813 --> 02:34:15,934
passed out in the corner. Is there someone you
know that we can call? I really hate just leaving

2526
02:34:15,934 --> 02:34:17,067
them here.

2527
02:34:17,067 --> 02:34:18,578
MATT: Make a deception check.

2528
02:34:18,578 --> 02:34:21,430
MARISHA: Oh my god. Come on, Grog!

2529
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:22,532
TALIESIN: Please a four.

2530
02:34:22,532 --> 02:34:23,680
TRAVIS: Nine.

2531
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,060
TALIESIN: Yes!

2532
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:32,192
MATT: He slowly hands out this really nice bundle,
and it has a little bow on it and it's wrapped,

2533
02:34:32,192 --> 02:34:41,796
and he hands it out to you and just goes, "Please,
take this and never come back. Please."

2534
02:34:41,796 --> 02:34:42,930
TRAVIS: For the rest of the day?

2535
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:50,475
MATT: "Ever again. Your presence has brought me no
end of pain. Just go."

2536
02:34:50,762 --> 02:34:54,559
TRAVIS: Obviously, we've gotten the better end of
this deal.

2537
02:34:54,559 --> 02:34:58,186
SAM: I think that that is true, absolutely.

2538
02:34:58,186 --> 02:34:59,171
TRAVIS: Do you still have the--

2539
02:34:59,171 --> 02:35:00,322
MATT: "Go!"

2540
02:35:00,322 --> 02:35:01,582
TRAVIS: We should go. We should leave.

2541
02:35:01,582 --> 02:35:04,087
SAM: All right. Thank you for your--

2542
02:35:04,087 --> 02:35:06,921
MATT: (incoherent noises)

2543
02:35:06,921 --> 02:35:10,466
SAM: Good day to you. Let's go. Doty, come.

2544
02:35:10,466 --> 02:35:11,540
TRAVIS: Bidet.

2545
02:35:11,540 --> 02:35:21,200
MATT: Doty turns. "Ahh!" And comes running after
you guys as you exit the shop.

2546
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:22,379
LIAM: Holy shit.

2547
02:35:22,379 --> 02:35:24,266
TALIESIN: That was amazing. I don't feel good.

2548
02:35:24,266 --> 02:35:26,898
MARISHA: Wow.

2549
02:35:26,898 --> 02:35:30,945
TRAVIS: Good job. We've got to go. We've got to
hole up somewhere for a minute.

2550
02:35:30,945 --> 02:35:32,371
You know. A drink?

2551
02:35:32,371 --> 02:35:33,891
SAM: Please.

2552
02:35:33,891 --> 02:35:36,870
TRAVIS: Yeah. Is there a tavern near this shop?

2553
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:38,806
MATT: In the Quad Roads? Yeah. There's actually
quite a few taverns.

2554
02:35:38,806 --> 02:35:41,057
SAM: As soon as we step outside, I barf all over
the floor.

2555
02:35:41,057 --> 02:35:42,899
(all laugh)

2556
02:35:42,899 --> 02:35:44,986
TRAVIS: Where was that? What the fuck?

2557
02:35:44,986 --> 02:35:47,735
SAM: I'm sorry. It just comes naturally. I can't
force it.

2558
02:35:47,735 --> 02:35:54,634
TRAVIS: You can't perform on command? I needed
you. Okay, you got more in there?

2559
02:35:54,634 --> 02:35:55,545
SAM: No.

2560
02:35:55,545 --> 02:35:56,398
TRAVIS: It's just a one-er?

2561
02:35:56,398 --> 02:35:57,483
SAM: Maybe a little.

2562
02:35:57,483 --> 02:35:58,373
TRAVIS: Okay.

2563
02:35:58,373 --> 02:35:59,646
SAM: (barfs)

2564
02:35:59,646 --> 02:36:02,529
TRAVIS: Okay. That looks like Lucky Charms.

2565
02:36:02,529 --> 02:36:08,122
MATT: Okay. While you guys get a drink, we're
going to get a quick bathroom break. We have a

2566
02:36:08,122 --> 02:36:10,824
couple more beats we want to get through before
the night's end. We're not going to go too long,

2567
02:36:10,824 --> 02:36:13,885
trust me. But we're going to take a quick bathroom
break, and then we'll come back here in a few

2568
02:36:13,885 --> 02:36:19,004
minutes. We do have one more giveaway here tonight
from our awesome friends at Wyrmwood. We have a

2569
02:36:19,004 --> 02:36:28,531
dice box here, signed by the cast of Critical
Role. It is a birch dice box. Do we have a code

2570
02:36:28,531 --> 02:36:31,385
for the chat room?

2571
02:36:32,187 --> 02:36:33,487
CREW: Wyrmwood!

2572
02:36:33,487 --> 02:36:37,696
MATT: Wyrmwood. Go ahead and use, one word,
Wyrmwood, in the chat room on Twitch. We'll have a

2573
02:36:37,696 --> 02:36:41,736
break, and we'll have a winner announced for you
when we get back.

2574
02:36:41,736 --> 02:36:43,386
MARISHA: Wyrmwood with a 'y'.

2575
02:36:43,386 --> 02:36:47,011
MATT: Yes, Wyrmwood with a 'y', as in the actual
company. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you in

2576
02:36:47,011 --> 02:36:48,326
a few minutes.

2577
02:36:48,326 --> 02:51:34,474
[break]

2578
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:37,264
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, first and
foremost, we have our winner in the chat room.

2579
02:51:37,264 --> 02:51:42,317
'OnlyTwentiesAllowed'. Great name, by the way. You
won the contest for this week. We're going to go

2580
02:51:42,317 --> 02:51:46,176
ahead and get your information, and send you your
Wyrmwood box. Thank you again, Wyrmwood, for

2581
02:51:46,176 --> 02:51:51,941
sending that so we can get that to you guys for
free as the contest weekly. Back into the story we

2582
02:51:51,941 --> 02:51:56,789
were. So, you guys are drinking and laying low.

2583
02:51:56,789 --> 02:51:57,950
TRAVIS: Yep.

2584
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:59,900
MATT: You guys were making your way to the
library, you said?

2585
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:00,868
LAURA: Yes.

2586
02:52:00,868 --> 02:52:01,760
MATT: Okay.

2587
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:03,515
MARISHA: We're going to finish up and try and get
out, I guess?

2588
02:52:03,515 --> 02:52:04,454
MATT: Okay.

2589
02:52:04,454 --> 02:52:09,560
TALIESIN: I would also like to definitely talk
about maybe having access later, to come back at

2590
02:52:09,560 --> 02:52:10,952
some point.

2591
02:52:10,952 --> 02:52:12,867
MARISHA: We want to talk to Kusuo and see.

2592
02:52:12,867 --> 02:52:14,263
TALIESIN: Just on our way out.

2593
02:52:14,263 --> 02:52:19,582
MATT: On the way out, as the tomes are placed
and locked back up, you talk to Kusuo. "That is not a

2594
02:52:19,582 --> 02:52:22,770
"worry. Just make sure that you request me when you
arrive."

2595
02:52:22,842 --> 02:52:23,803
MARISHA: Okay.

2596
02:52:23,803 --> 02:52:25,076
MATT: "It would be my pleasure."

2597
02:52:25,076 --> 02:52:29,571
TALIESIN: Thank you so much. And I hope that that
book finds a proper home and is worthwhile. Thank

2598
02:52:29,571 --> 02:52:30,708
you for your time.

2599
02:52:30,708 --> 02:52:37,079
MARISHA: Thank you. And would it be possible if we
bring friends of ours in the future who are--

2600
02:52:37,079 --> 02:52:40,330
TALIESIN: Of our group.

2601
02:52:40,330 --> 02:52:44,703
MARISHA: Yeah, who are fluent in these languages.

2602
02:52:44,703 --> 02:52:47,322
MATT: "But of course. Just make sure that you
accompany them."

2603
02:52:47,322 --> 02:52:48,270
TALIESIN: Of course.

2604
02:52:48,270 --> 02:52:49,672
MARISHA: Thank you.

2605
02:52:49,672 --> 02:52:56,521
MATT: He leads you out. You guys exit the library
just as Vax and Vex, after finding information on

2606
02:52:56,521 --> 02:52:58,943
where to go, arrive.

2607
02:52:58,943 --> 02:53:00,204
LAURA: Do you guys have the book?

2608
02:53:00,204 --> 02:53:00,894
TALIESIN: We do.

2609
02:53:00,894 --> 02:53:01,917
MARISHA: We totally do.

2610
02:53:01,917 --> 02:53:02,933
LAURA: What the fuck?

2611
02:53:02,933 --> 02:53:05,988
MARISHA: I know-- I thought-- You know, I think--
I don't know.

2612
02:53:05,988 --> 02:53:07,381
LAURA: What did you find?

2613
02:53:07,381 --> 02:53:10,540
MARISHA: Well, some good stuff.

2614
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:12,396
TALIESIN: It actually went quite well.

2615
02:53:12,396 --> 02:53:13,279
LAURA: All right.

2616
02:53:13,279 --> 02:53:16,195
MARISHA: We found one book that we could read, and
one book that we couldn't.

2617
02:53:16,195 --> 02:53:17,593
LAURA: Okay.

2618
02:53:17,593 --> 02:53:21,353
MARISHA: So we'll have to come back with you guys.
Because it was all written in Abyssal.

2619
02:53:21,353 --> 02:53:22,507
LAURA: We can read that!

2620
02:53:22,507 --> 02:53:25,383
MARISHA: Yes! Because your father forced you to do
things.

2621
02:53:25,383 --> 02:53:29,838
TALIESIN: Don't they all. Speaking of fathers
forcing you to do things, we have to deal with

2622
02:53:29,838 --> 02:53:34,442
you. We have a starting point for the rakshasa.

2623
02:53:34,495 --> 02:53:35,924
LAURA: Wonderful.

2624
02:53:35,924 --> 02:53:42,392
TALIESIN: So, soon, when it's time, step one will
be the City of Dis.

2625
02:53:42,392 --> 02:53:44,143
LAURA: The City of Dis?

2626
02:53:44,143 --> 02:53:46,634
TALIESIN: Dis City. Not this city, but the City of
Dis.

2627
02:53:46,634 --> 02:53:47,481
LAURA: Okay.

2628
02:53:47,481 --> 02:53:49,379
MARISHA: We built Dis city.

2629
02:53:49,379 --> 02:53:51,504
TALIESIN: Did you build Dis city?

2630
02:53:51,504 --> 02:53:53,047
MARISHA: On rock'n'roll.

2631
02:53:53,121 --> 02:53:54,470
LIAM: Can I have that book please?

2632
02:53:54,470 --> 02:53:56,591
TALIESIN: Oh, yes! Hi. Yes, this is-- Yes.

2633
02:53:56,591 --> 02:53:59,636
LIAM: I'm just going to hold on to that.

2634
02:53:59,636 --> 02:54:02,639
TALIESIN: Are you going to hold on-- Do we have a
bag to put that in?

2635
02:54:02,639 --> 02:54:07,066
LAURA: We have Grog's bag of holding, the same one
we've always had. Hey, is there somewhere we could

2636
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:09,687
buy a fucking bag of holding?

2637
02:54:09,687 --> 02:54:11,593
TRAVIS: They're kind of rare.

2638
02:54:11,593 --> 02:54:14,621
MATT: They're not expensive.

2639
02:54:14,621 --> 02:54:16,390
TRAVIS: To Grog, they're rare.

2640
02:54:16,390 --> 02:54:19,892
MATT: But you could ask around and try to find
somebody. It'll take a little time. You guys are

2641
02:54:19,892 --> 02:54:24,659
right now hitting the cusp of dawn. Sorry, dusk.

2642
02:54:24,659 --> 02:54:28,546
LAURA: Is there somewhere I could find before
things close? Just to see?

2643
02:54:28,546 --> 02:54:31,249
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2644
02:54:33,624 --> 02:54:38,003
LAURA: Oh, balls. That's terrible.

2645
02:54:38,003 --> 02:54:39,155
MATT: What did you roll?

2646
02:54:39,155 --> 02:54:40,823
LAURA: I rolled 13.

2647
02:54:40,823 --> 02:54:44,385
MATT: You manage to find one location, but it's
been closed for half an hour when you get there.

2648
02:54:44,385 --> 02:54:46,700
LAURA: Fuck! Fuck. Fine. It's fine.

2649
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:48,987
TALIESIN: It's in Los Angeles.

2650
02:54:48,987 --> 02:54:49,913
TRAVIS: Pittsburgh.

2651
02:54:49,913 --> 02:54:51,680
MARISHA: Pittsburgh, yeah.

2652
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:52,956
LAURA: Keyleth?

2653
02:54:52,956 --> 02:54:53,560
MARISHA: Yeah?

2654
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:57,198
LAURA: How about we go see your dad.

2655
02:54:57,198 --> 02:54:59,882
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

2656
02:54:59,882 --> 02:55:03,320
LIAM: Are we tabling the book, then?

2657
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:05,463
TALIESIN: We're going to drop it off, I think.

2658
02:55:05,518 --> 02:55:09,359
MARISHA: What did you guys find out? Is it a good
spot, a good home for it?

2659
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:10,849
Do you want to drop it off?

2660
02:55:10,849 --> 02:55:14,841
LAURA: They definitely are interested in it at the
Platinum Sanctuary.

2661
02:55:14,841 --> 02:55:17,902
LIAM: A little too interested for my taste.

2662
02:55:17,902 --> 02:55:19,367
TALIESIN: You think?

2663
02:55:19,367 --> 02:55:25,840
LIAM: Yes. I don't want this book in anyone's
hands, frankly.

2664
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:29,782
LAURA: They were very interested in researching
it. Which I don't think is a bad thing. They're

2665
02:55:29,782 --> 02:55:36,168
good people. And learning about history is a good
way to keep yourself from repeating it. However,

2666
02:55:36,168 --> 02:55:45,857
you do serve the Raven Queen, who I know wants
nothing to do with the undead. And if it means

2667
02:55:45,857 --> 02:55:50,309
destroying this book, then do what needs to be
done.

2668
02:55:50,309 --> 02:55:52,925
TALIESIN: Can we destroy this book?

2669
02:55:52,925 --> 02:55:56,961
MARISHA: It's like our magical items. It's not
easy to destroy them.

2670
02:55:56,961 --> 02:56:00,235
Seems like a pretty powerful book.

2671
02:56:00,235 --> 02:56:03,937
TALIESIN: The fear I have with the book is of
course if we keep it, we keep it out of the hands

2672
02:56:03,937 --> 02:56:09,652
of everyone, save those who are finally strong
enough to best us.

2673
02:56:10,035 --> 02:56:13,017
LIAM: Do we want this book to travel to hell?

2674
02:56:13,017 --> 02:56:14,447
MARISH: Ooh, no.

2675
02:56:14,447 --> 02:56:17,164
TALIESIN: No, no.

2676
02:56:17,164 --> 02:56:23,672
MARISHA: But it might not be a bad-- I mean, we
did drop off the horn of Orcus here.

2677
02:56:23,672 --> 02:56:30,003
LIAM: I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get
everything set to go, and I will drop this off.

2678
02:56:30,003 --> 02:56:34,805
MARISHA: What? Where? There? Where?

2679
02:56:34,805 --> 02:56:38,750
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh.

2680
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:40,354
LIAM: Yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

2681
02:56:40,354 --> 02:56:42,538
MARISHA: You're going to go back to the temple.

2682
02:56:42,538 --> 02:56:46,748
TALIESIN: That's a terrible idea. I kind of like
it. That's not a good thing. I think it's a good

2683
02:56:46,748 --> 02:56:49,276
idea. That may not be a good thing.

2684
02:56:49,276 --> 02:56:51,539
LIAM: Do you want to come with me?

2685
02:56:51,539 --> 02:56:54,314
TALIESIN: Yes.

2686
02:56:54,314 --> 02:56:56,045
LIAM: I hook him by the arm and we just start
off.

2687
02:56:56,045 --> 02:56:57,365
TALIESIN: Find a bar!

2688
02:56:57,365 --> 02:57:00,048
MARISHA: I'll get things packed?

2689
02:57:00,048 --> 02:57:03,767
LAURA: It was my idea! Go fuck yourself.

2690
02:57:03,767 --> 02:57:05,808
LIAM: Love you!

2691
02:57:05,808 --> 02:57:08,274
MARISHA: I look at Vex.

2692
02:57:08,274 --> 02:57:10,166
LAURA: Dresses? Oh, everything's fucking closed!

2693
02:57:10,166 --> 02:57:11,794
MARISHA: Oh goddamnit, Pittsburgh.

2694
02:57:11,794 --> 02:57:15,235
LAURA: Are there dress shops open? At all?

2695
02:57:15,235 --> 02:57:17,082
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2696
02:57:17,082 --> 02:57:18,471
LIAM: This ain't New York City.

2697
02:57:18,471 --> 02:57:22,112
LAURA: We just want pretty dresses. Oh! Oh! Oh!

2698
02:57:22,112 --> 02:57:24,561
MARISHA: Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl.

2699
02:57:24,561 --> 02:57:26,023
LAURA: 25.

2700
02:57:26,023 --> 02:57:28,409
MATT: You do manage to find one individual who is
in the process of

2701
02:57:28,409 --> 02:57:31,828
closing their formal attire shop.

2702
02:57:31,828 --> 02:57:36,127
MARISHA: I toss them 20 gold. An extra 20 minutes,
please.

2703
02:57:36,127 --> 02:57:38,180
MATT: "But of course! Come on in."

2704
02:57:38,180 --> 02:57:39,535
MARISHA: Thank you.

2705
02:57:39,535 --> 02:57:41,703
TRAVIS: Wow.

2706
02:57:41,703 --> 02:57:44,696
LAURA: Ah! Everything's better!

2707
02:57:44,696 --> 02:57:47,562
MATT: (laughs) All right.

2708
02:57:47,562 --> 02:57:49,996
LAURA: Keyleth?

2709
02:57:49,996 --> 02:57:51,540
MARISHA: What?

2710
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:55,184
LAURA: What's good for your Ashari people?
Something covered in grass, maybe?

2711
02:57:55,184 --> 02:57:58,254
MARISHA: Mm.

2712
02:57:58,254 --> 02:58:00,378
LAURA: Turf? Astro-turf?

2713
02:58:00,378 --> 02:58:07,903
MARISHA: You know, it's a little esoteric for me.
A little experimental. A little Gaga-esque.

2714
02:58:07,903 --> 02:58:10,149
LAURA: Lots of pink bows, maybe, for me.

2715
02:58:10,149 --> 02:58:17,134
MARISHA: You know, it reminds a little of when we
dressed Trinket up in pink bows.

2716
02:58:17,134 --> 02:58:19,082
LAURA: Right, and we could be like--

2717
02:58:19,082 --> 02:58:22,580
MARISHA: I don't know if that's a good thing.

2718
02:58:22,580 --> 02:58:23,817
LAURA: Help us. Make us pretty.

2719
02:58:23,817 --> 02:58:25,114
MARISHA: Make us pretty.

2720
02:58:25,114 --> 02:58:26,791
LAURA: And very expensive looking.

2721
02:58:26,791 --> 02:58:30,094
MARISHA: I'm going to become royalty. Kind of, but
not really.

2722
02:58:30,094 --> 02:58:32,499
LAURA: It's my first time getting to dress up as
royalty.

2723
02:58:32,499 --> 02:58:33,599
MARISHA: Yes!

2724
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:41,248
MATT: "All right. That-- Okay." The gentleman
seems a bit overwhelmed, but quickly goes ahead

2725
02:58:41,248 --> 02:58:47,224
and helps you guys find, over the next 30 or so
minutes, some very nice dresses. Better than

2726
02:58:47,224 --> 02:58:52,618
anything you've previously worn. And he gets you
something that he thinks royalty should wear. As

2727
02:58:52,618 --> 02:59:00,590
there is no real royalty in Vasselheim, it is a
church-run state. It is more of a frumpy robe with

2728
02:59:00,590 --> 02:59:02,529
a fur collar.

2729
02:59:02,529 --> 02:59:04,771
MARISHA: Vex, this collar is so big.

2730
02:59:04,771 --> 02:59:06,802
LAURA: This is terrible. Give her something flowy.

2731
02:59:06,802 --> 02:59:08,434
MARISHA: Why can't I see over it?

2732
02:59:08,434 --> 02:59:16,193
MATT: "Flowy. Of course. I'm so sorry. Flowy,
yes." He's starting to get a little impatient, but

2733
02:59:16,193 --> 02:59:23,084
does manage to pull one very nice simple gown,
that just hangs off the shoulders and pools on the

2734
02:59:23,084 --> 02:59:24,519
ground around you.

2735
02:59:24,519 --> 02:59:26,291
LAURA: In all the colors. Can it be in all the
colors?

2736
02:59:26,291 --> 02:59:29,078
MARISHA: Yeah, can we dip-dye it blue?

2737
02:59:29,078 --> 02:59:33,173
MATT: "Dye? I could have it dyed. That would be by
tomorrow morning prepared."

2738
02:59:33,173 --> 02:59:34,355
LAURA: Okay.

2739
02:59:34,355 --> 02:59:35,592
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2740
02:59:35,592 --> 02:59:37,317
MATT: "All right, I'll get it taken care of."

2741
02:59:37,317 --> 02:59:38,775
MARISHA: Okay.

2742
02:59:38,775 --> 02:59:42,168
MATT: All right. While that's happening, you two
are heading to the Raven's Crest?

2743
02:59:42,168 --> 02:59:43,170
LIAM: Yeah.

2744
02:59:43,170 --> 02:59:52,334
MATT: All right. So you guys walk over to the Dusk
Meadow. You're met by the same gray, slightly

2745
02:59:52,334 --> 02:59:57,560
bleak atmosphere on this side of Vasselheim. But
you make your way to the exterior of the large

2746
02:59:57,560 --> 03:00:06,820
structure. The ominous obsidian and gold building
that represents the center, if you will, the

2747
03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:14,120
beating heart of the Raven Queen's worship. As you
approach the front stairway, both of you familiar

2748
03:00:14,120 --> 03:00:24,540
with, one brought in, the other not met with any
living person for the most part in your journey,

2749
03:00:24,598 --> 03:00:28,547
you both approach-- still arms hooked?

2750
03:00:28,547 --> 03:00:29,513
LIAM: No.

2751
03:00:29,513 --> 03:00:31,008
MATT: Okay.

2752
03:00:31,008 --> 03:00:33,571
LIAM: I suspect you've been here before.

2753
03:00:33,571 --> 03:00:35,296
TALIESIN: Yes.

2754
03:00:43,816 --> 03:00:54,274
LIAM: (sighs) I like that things are better
between you and I now.

2755
03:00:54,345 --> 03:01:02,189
TALIESIN: I feel the same. I like that most things
are better now. Not everything, but it's a

2756
03:01:02,189 --> 03:01:05,178
brighter world, even for us.

2757
03:01:05,178 --> 03:01:14,351
LIAM: Do you know what I like? I like the version
of you that my sister brings out.

2758
03:01:14,351 --> 03:01:29,100
TALIESIN: I do too. I'll do my best to keep him in
the forefront. And as for you: I like the version

2759
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:40,544
of you that's not afraid. So let's go meet this
terrible thing, drop off the book, get you feeling

2760
03:01:40,544 --> 03:01:42,809
a bit better.

2761
03:01:42,809 --> 03:01:45,258
LIAM: (clears throat) Come on.

2762
03:01:45,258 --> 03:01:48,036
TALIESIN: Fuck. (clears throat)

2763
03:01:48,036 --> 03:01:55,341
MATT: As you both ascend the stairs, you see
standing-- previously not noticed as you guys were

2764
03:01:55,341 --> 03:02:01,088
having a conversation-- but off to the sides of
each side of the entryway, the two doors that are

2765
03:02:01,088 --> 03:02:07,599
closed, there are two women in long black gowns
with dark veils that drift over their head to the

2766
03:02:07,599 --> 03:02:14,419
mid torso, that you had lead you into the chamber
initially. Both suddenly present themselves, bow,

2767
03:02:14,419 --> 03:02:20,887
and step out of the side as the chamber doors open
to the interior of the Raven's Crest temple.

2768
03:02:20,887 --> 03:02:28,439
There, standing as the doors open, is what looks
to be an older woman wearing the same attire, the

2769
03:02:28,439 --> 03:02:35,126
same dark veil, somewhat able to see her features
beneath the dark material that hangs in front of

2770
03:02:35,126 --> 03:02:39,175
her. She steps forward as the doors open.

2771
03:02:40,764 --> 03:03:00,832
LIAM: Hello there. You recognize me. This is my
friend. We bring you an offering for the Queen.

2772
03:03:04,023 --> 03:03:09,022
MATT: The woman bends down, takes the tome from
your hand. She holds it, she takes her fingers and

2773
03:03:09,022 --> 03:03:17,279
brushes the cloth away that currently obscures the
tome, takes a look at it, holds it a foot further

2774
03:03:17,279 --> 03:03:24,928
away from her face, and throws the cloth over the
front, clasps it in her arms and brings it down

2775
03:03:25,142 --> 03:03:30,183
towards her torso. And, for the first time since
this-- you've heard her speak before, you have

2776
03:03:30,183 --> 03:03:35,387
done this before-- but the strange eerie kind of
airy whisper comes out from this older woman as

2777
03:03:35,387 --> 03:03:47,734
she bends forward, clutching this tome. "We thank
you. And we will be sure that this finds its final seal."

2778
03:03:54,506 --> 03:04:10,429
LIAM: She has begun to speak to me. Her desires
are not clear, entirely, but I am listening. And I

2779
03:04:10,429 --> 03:04:13,218
intend to learn.

2780
03:04:14,870 --> 03:04:16,940
MATT: "Good."

2781
03:04:20,837 --> 03:04:26,449
LIAM: We have to go. But I mean to come back.

2782
03:04:26,630 --> 03:04:34,712
MATT: "Whenever you're ready. The vision of the
gods is obscured beyond the Divine Gate. We are

2783
03:04:34,712 --> 03:04:41,160
"not just their tools but their extensions. The
creations that act as their fingers in this plane.

2784
03:04:41,212 --> 03:04:57,911
"The center of all other life and death. Be
watchful. Be vigilant." She bows, and backs into

2785
03:04:57,911 --> 03:05:03,884
the Raven's Crest once more as the doors close,
the two other women now flanking out of the

2786
03:05:03,884 --> 03:05:07,867
shadows and stepping before each door, and
seemingly just

2787
03:05:07,867 --> 03:05:10,720
not paying attention to your presence.

2788
03:05:12,902 --> 03:05:20,716
TALIESIN: I was envious of you once. God. So
sorry. (sighs)

2789
03:05:20,716 --> 03:05:24,588
LIAM: (whispers) Good day.

2790
03:05:24,588 --> 03:05:26,173
MATT: They make no response as you guys turn and
make your way

2791
03:05:26,173 --> 03:05:28,933
down the stairs from the Raven's Crest.

2792
03:05:32,949 --> 03:05:41,592
TALIESIN: Just so you know, it is your duty to
have some joy in the meantime. You do know that,

2793
03:05:41,592 --> 03:05:55,301
right? You're no use to her a wreck. She needs a
man. Have a fucking beer. And I slap him on the

2794
03:05:55,301 --> 03:05:58,945
ass as we walk towards the pub.

2795
03:05:58,945 --> 03:06:08,976
LIAM: Look over my shoulder at the temple as we
walk. Come on, let's get drunk.

2796
03:06:09,874 --> 03:06:14,913
MATT: As your head moves forward, walking, you feel
this cold tingle just drift down the back of your

2797
03:06:14,968 --> 03:06:25,814
neck and spine, then it fades, and you keep
walking, carrying on your chest there a brief,

2798
03:06:25,814 --> 03:06:41,905
warm secondary heartbeat representing the brief
boon granted upon you by the Raven Queen. You

2799
03:06:41,905 --> 03:06:45,251
catch up with the ladies at the bar.

2800
03:06:47,096 --> 03:06:48,475
MARISHA: Hey!

2801
03:06:48,475 --> 03:06:50,777
LAURA and SAM: (laugh)

2802
03:06:50,777 --> 03:06:54,210
TALIESIN: I shove Keyleth at him. Fix that, good
god.

2803
03:06:54,210 --> 03:06:55,606
LIAM: (laughs)

2804
03:06:55,606 --> 03:06:56,968
TALIESIN: Ahh.

2805
03:06:56,968 --> 03:06:58,069
LIAM: Scoop and lift.

2806
03:06:58,069 --> 03:06:59,054
MARISHA: Are you broken again?

2807
03:06:59,054 --> 03:06:59,793
LIAM: No.

2808
03:06:59,793 --> 03:07:00,351
MARISHA: Ah.

2809
03:07:00,351 --> 03:07:01,603
LIAM: I need a drink, have you had one already?

2810
03:07:01,603 --> 03:07:02,369
MARISHA: Yes.

2811
03:07:02,369 --> 03:07:03,014
LIAM: I'm fine.

2812
03:07:03,014 --> 03:07:03,915
LAURA: She's had a few.

2813
03:07:03,915 --> 03:07:04,741
LIAM: Yeah?

2814
03:07:04,741 --> 03:07:06,947
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

2815
03:07:06,947 --> 03:07:13,951
MATT: You guys, you've found dresses that are to
your liking. You've-- the cost of them with the

2816
03:07:13,951 --> 03:07:17,895
materials would probably run about 20 gold
apiece.

2817
03:07:17,895 --> 03:07:19,709
LAURA: I think that's acceptable.

2818
03:07:19,709 --> 03:07:20,908
SAM: (laughs)

2819
03:07:20,908 --> 03:07:22,248
MARISHA: Designer.

2820
03:07:22,248 --> 03:07:23,585
LAURA: Mm-hm.

2821
03:07:23,585 --> 03:07:24,369
TALIESIN: Couture.

2822
03:07:24,369 --> 03:07:25,038
MARISHA: Couture.

2823
03:07:25,038 --> 03:07:27,145
LAURA: I can't believe these dresses are so much
cheaper than a healing potion.

2824
03:07:27,145 --> 03:07:28,075
MARISHA: I know.

2825
03:07:28,075 --> 03:07:28,806
LAURA: Ridiculous.

2826
03:07:28,806 --> 03:07:31,022
MARISHA: It's like, look at the beading!

2827
03:07:31,022 --> 03:07:32,082
LAURA: (laughs)

2828
03:07:32,082 --> 03:07:33,344
MARISHA: It's crazy!

2829
03:07:33,344 --> 03:07:36,922
LAURA: Wait, we're picking them up in the morning,
Keyleth. You're not even wearing it yet.

2830
03:07:36,922 --> 03:07:38,514
MARISHA: In the morning, I'll look at the
beading.

2831
03:07:38,514 --> 03:07:40,317
(all laugh)

2832
03:07:40,317 --> 03:07:41,691
KEYLETH: It's crazy.

2833
03:07:41,691 --> 03:07:42,966
TALIESIN: That's sweat, yes.

2834
03:07:42,966 --> 03:07:43,666
KEYLETH: Yeah.

2835
03:07:43,666 --> 03:07:44,751
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2836
03:07:44,751 --> 03:07:48,064
Ah, where are Grog and Taryon?

2837
03:07:48,137 --> 03:07:50,144
LAURA: Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long
time.

2838
03:07:50,144 --> 03:07:51,431
TALIESIN: Grog, Taryon!

2839
03:07:51,431 --> 03:07:52,245
LAURA: Grog!

2840
03:07:52,245 --> 03:07:53,344
TRAVIS: Can we hear them?

2841
03:07:53,344 --> 03:07:57,214
MATT: You were still in the Quad Roads, keeping
low. You guys are both-- you're able to hear them.

2842
03:07:57,214 --> 03:08:01,979
Whatever you guys have been up to trying to stay
out of sight.

2843
03:08:01,979 --> 03:08:03,654
TRAVIS: Yes?

2844
03:08:03,654 --> 03:08:05,862
TALIESIN: We're at a bar, where are you?

2845
03:08:05,862 --> 03:08:10,865
TRAVIS: Funny, we are doing something similar. Are
you done?

2846
03:08:10,865 --> 03:08:14,302
TALIESIN: No, we're just starting. You--

2847
03:08:14,302 --> 03:08:16,054
SAM: Are they talking to you right now?

2848
03:08:16,054 --> 03:08:16,788
TRAVIS: Yeah, they are.

2849
03:08:16,788 --> 03:08:17,609
TALIESIN: Is that Taryon?

2850
03:08:17,609 --> 03:08:18,788
SAM: Just tell them to--

2851
03:08:18,788 --> 03:08:19,926
TALIESIN: Tell him we say hello.

2852
03:08:19,926 --> 03:08:22,178
TRAVIS: All right. The two fucking people talking
to--

2853
03:08:22,178 --> 03:08:22,972
SAM: Tell them--

2854
03:08:22,972 --> 03:08:23,819
TRAVIS: Yep.

2855
03:08:23,819 --> 03:08:25,144
LAURA: Did you buy potions?

2856
03:08:25,144 --> 03:08:25,986
SAM: Can we ask them where they are?

2857
03:08:25,986 --> 03:08:26,760
TALIESIN: I need to talk to Taryon.

2858
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:27,391
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2859
03:08:27,391 --> 03:08:28,377
SAM: Ask them where they are.

2860
03:08:28,377 --> 03:08:30,049
TALIESIN: Tell Taryon to take you where we all are
right now

2861
03:08:30,049 --> 03:08:31,849
SAM: Tell them where we are right now, and ask
them where they are.

2862
03:08:31,849 --> 03:08:34,373
TALIESIN: Just have him bring us to us-- I'll give
you directions. It'll be fine.

2863
03:08:34,373 --> 03:08:35,497
SAM: Tell them--

2864
03:08:35,497 --> 03:08:37,956
TRAVIS: My real-world ADD is fully maxed out.

2865
03:08:37,956 --> 03:08:40,123
(all laugh)

2866
03:08:40,123 --> 03:08:46,422
TRAVIS: I just heard a bunch of sea lions barking
like, "Ar ar ar ar." It was nothing. Oh fuck.

2867
03:08:46,422 --> 03:08:48,664
TALIESIN: Why don't you two come join us?

2868
03:08:48,664 --> 03:08:52,234
TRAVIS: I reach over, I cover Tary's mouth.
Percy?

2869
03:08:52,234 --> 03:08:53,253
TALIESIN: Yes?

2870
03:08:53,253 --> 03:08:55,498
TRAVIS: Let me know when you're done.

2871
03:08:55,498 --> 03:08:57,503
TALIESIN: Are you sure? We're drinking. You can
join.

2872
03:08:57,503 --> 03:08:59,948
TRAVIS: All right. What tavern are you in?

2873
03:08:59,948 --> 03:09:03,652
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to send you the
psychic information of where we are right now.

2874
03:09:03,652 --> 03:09:05,078
TRAVIS: You can do that?

2875
03:09:05,078 --> 03:09:06,556
LAURA: I want to say the name of it.

2876
03:09:06,556 --> 03:09:08,367
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh)

2877
03:09:08,367 --> 03:09:14,448
MATT: Okay. Vex lets you know that this is the--
shit, what is it? What tavern would this be here?

2878
03:09:14,448 --> 03:09:16,237
Let me go through.

2879
03:09:16,237 --> 03:09:18,586
TALIESIN: Can't you just bullshit? You have to
actually look up the real name?

2880
03:09:18,586 --> 03:09:20,082
SAM: No, there's two bars in Vasselheim!

2881
03:09:20,082 --> 03:09:21,618
MATT: There are a lot of bars in Vasselheim.

2882
03:09:21,618 --> 03:09:25,633
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's-- the other bar would
actually be enough.

2883
03:09:25,633 --> 03:09:26,593
LAURA: The other bar.

2884
03:09:26,593 --> 03:09:27,980
MATT: The Siren's Succor.

2885
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:29,730
LAURA: (mystical voice) We're in the Siren's
Succor.

2886
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:31,228
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I heard it.

2887
03:09:31,228 --> 03:09:32,231
TALIESIN: Isn't that amazing?

2888
03:09:32,231 --> 03:09:33,546
TRAVIS: My powers are getting stronger.

2889
03:09:33,546 --> 03:09:35,491
TALIESIN: I've gone beyond the veil.

2890
03:09:35,491 --> 03:09:37,367
TRAVIS: All right. We'll make our way over to
you.

2891
03:09:37,367 --> 03:09:38,457
TALIESIN: I've gained such power.

2892
03:09:38,457 --> 03:09:40,523
LAURA: (mystical voice) Meet us soon. Did you buy
potions?

2893
03:09:40,523 --> 03:09:42,142
TRAVIS: Are you asking me to buy potions, Percy?

2894
03:09:42,142 --> 03:09:44,815
TALIESIN: No, I want you to come straight to the
bar. Straight to the bar.

2895
03:09:44,815 --> 03:09:46,579
TRAVIS: But I thought you just sent me a request
for--

2896
03:09:46,579 --> 03:09:49,644
TALIESIN: I was thinking about something else. No,
you just heard me thinking about something else.

2897
03:09:49,701 --> 03:09:51,705
TRAVIS: All right, we'll have to fine-tune my
abilities.

2898
03:09:51,705 --> 03:09:52,346
TALIESIN: You'll get there.

2899
03:09:52,346 --> 03:09:53,198
TRAVIS: All right.

2900
03:09:53,198 --> 03:09:54,367
TALIESIN: I have every faith.

2901
03:09:54,367 --> 03:09:56,674
MARISHA: You're doing really well at perfecting
your mystical voice.

2902
03:09:56,674 --> 03:09:59,177
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I hear two voices.

2903
03:09:59,177 --> 03:10:00,835
MARISHA: Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it.

2904
03:10:00,835 --> 03:10:06,112
LIAM: Freddie. Order me something that rich people
drink.

2905
03:10:08,063 --> 03:10:10,088
LAURA: Beer! (laughs)

2906
03:10:10,088 --> 03:10:10,906
TALIESIN: Get him--

2907
03:10:10,906 --> 03:10:12,044
LAURA: Some wine.

2908
03:10:12,044 --> 03:10:14,305
LIAM: Is that it? I've done beer.

2909
03:10:14,305 --> 03:10:20,501
TALIESIN: Get him a giant glass of half Guinness,
half whatever cider they have.

2910
03:10:20,501 --> 03:10:21,483
LAURA: Ugh.

2911
03:10:21,483 --> 03:10:24,852
TALIESIN: Rich people get drunk. Oh, do you want
something fancy?

2912
03:10:24,852 --> 03:10:25,708
LIAM: Yeah!

2913
03:10:25,708 --> 03:10:27,182
TALIESIN: Okay, I take the black and tan.

2914
03:10:27,182 --> 03:10:28,848
MATT: (laughs)

2915
03:10:28,848 --> 03:10:30,057
MARISHA: Oh, black and tan.

2916
03:10:30,057 --> 03:10:32,744
TALIESIN: And I get him a tiny glass of creme de
menthe. (laughs)

2917
03:10:32,744 --> 03:10:37,966
LIAM: This one tells me that you have the goods,
so I want the goods. Want the goods.

2918
03:10:37,966 --> 03:10:40,496
TALIESIN: I don't know how to feel a little
awkward in saying I'm not sure I want to waste it

2919
03:10:40,496 --> 03:10:42,365
on you. But--

2920
03:10:42,365 --> 03:10:45,030
LIAM: We're in a bar, you fucker. Buy me a drink,
you asshole.

2921
03:10:45,030 --> 03:10:47,164
I've saved your life like three times.

2922
03:10:47,164 --> 03:10:50,108
TALIESIN: I wait for her to nod. Okay, that's
enough.

2923
03:10:50,108 --> 03:10:52,472
MARISHA: What do you mean by the goods?

2924
03:10:52,472 --> 03:10:57,582
TALIESIN: Oh dear. I pull up-- I tip the barman
because I'm showing him that I'm pulling something

2925
03:10:57,582 --> 03:11:00,038
out for some glassware.

2926
03:11:00,038 --> 03:11:00,952
MATT: Okay.

2927
03:11:00,952 --> 03:11:02,626
TALIESIN: Because I'm not an asshole.

2928
03:11:02,626 --> 03:11:03,311
MATT: Right.

2929
03:11:03,311 --> 03:11:04,187
TALIESIN: Well--

2930
03:11:04,187 --> 03:11:05,756
SAM: (incredulous sound)

2931
03:11:05,756 --> 03:11:07,160
(all laugh)

2932
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:10,077
TALIESIN: And then I pour a little bit of the Tear
Whiskey. Of the Green Tear.

2933
03:11:10,077 --> 03:11:11,963
LIAM: Mm.

2934
03:11:11,963 --> 03:11:14,266
TALIESIN: It's mean. It's minty. You'll love it.

2935
03:11:14,266 --> 03:11:15,086
LIAM: Hm.

2936
03:11:15,086 --> 03:11:16,423
TALIESIN: We have it every year.

2937
03:11:16,423 --> 03:11:18,235
MARISHA: Where did you keep that?

2938
03:11:18,235 --> 03:11:19,347
LAURA: (laughs)

2939
03:11:19,347 --> 03:11:20,580
MARISHA: Where'd you just pull that from?

2940
03:11:20,580 --> 03:11:25,084
TALIESIN: Okay, do you actually want me to answer?
You can say yes, it's all right. It's not going to

2941
03:11:25,084 --> 03:11:27,239
get weird. That's all right. I'm going to tell you
anyway.

2942
03:11:27,239 --> 03:11:28,381
MARISHA: Whoa. Jeez.

2943
03:11:28,381 --> 03:11:29,827
TALIESIN: See this belt? It's got a series of
these little--

2944
03:11:29,827 --> 03:11:31,067
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2945
03:11:31,067 --> 03:11:34,651
TALIESIN: -- things on. Those are mostly filled
with little bits of gunpowder I have wrapped up in

2946
03:11:34,651 --> 03:11:35,861
the thing.

2947
03:11:35,861 --> 03:11:36,670
LIAM: That's all?

2948
03:11:36,670 --> 03:11:37,673
MARISHA: Right.

2949
03:11:37,673 --> 03:11:38,808
TALIESIN: These last four are liquor.

2950
03:11:38,808 --> 03:11:39,692
MARISHA: (gasps)

2951
03:11:39,692 --> 03:11:40,502
TALIESIN: Sh.

2952
03:11:40,502 --> 03:11:41,983
MARISHA: That's so smart.

2953
03:11:41,983 --> 03:11:45,801
TALIESIN: That's how I can just stand everywhere
among their being idiots, is I'm really trashed.

2954
03:11:45,801 --> 03:11:48,511
MARISHA: Wow. And probably much cheaper than just
buying in bars all the time.

2955
03:11:48,511 --> 03:11:51,148
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I'm-- well. I like
to--

2956
03:11:51,148 --> 03:11:52,659
MARISHA: Wow.

2957
03:11:52,743 --> 03:11:54,177
TALIESIN: -- drink what we-- the locals.

2958
03:11:54,177 --> 03:11:55,436
LAURA: I'm staring at the door waiting for Grog
and Taryon.

2959
03:11:55,436 --> 03:11:56,743
MATT: You have to take the pre-gaming feat to
actually use that ability.

2960
03:11:56,743 --> 03:11:58,071
TALIESIN: What? Oh--

2961
03:11:58,071 --> 03:12:04,807
MATT: (laughs) At that point, you watch as Grog's
hands hit the doorway and he sheepishly looks in,

2962
03:12:04,807 --> 03:12:08,491
checking the surroundings for any possible--

2963
03:12:08,491 --> 03:12:09,484
LAURA: Grog.

2964
03:12:09,484 --> 03:12:10,928
TRAVIS: How busy is it in the tavern?

2965
03:12:10,928 --> 03:12:14,250
MATT: It's actually pretty sparse, aside from your
friends, maybe two other individuals.

2966
03:12:14,250 --> 03:12:16,045
TRAVIS: Okay. Come in. Come inside. Listen.

2967
03:12:16,045 --> 03:12:20,669
MATT: Okay. Tary comes in and (crashing sound)
behind you. Doty.

2968
03:12:20,669 --> 03:12:22,265
TRAVIS: No, sh. Gah. Sh.

2969
03:12:22,265 --> 03:12:23,255
MARISHA: Hey! Oh, sorry.

2970
03:12:23,255 --> 03:12:24,402
LAURA: I forgot how weird Doty looks.

2971
03:12:24,402 --> 03:12:26,040
TRAVIS: Sh. Jeez. Just bring it down a notch.

2972
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:27,138
TALIESIN: This is so-- Oh. Hm.

2973
03:12:27,138 --> 03:12:32,130
TRAVIS: Apparently, Dotty had a bit of a run-in
with some of that Vasselheim--

2974
03:12:32,182 --> 03:12:33,846
LAURA: Did you get it? Did you finally get it?

2975
03:12:33,846 --> 03:12:34,872
MARISHA: (laughs)

2976
03:12:34,872 --> 03:12:36,196
SAM: Did you get it?

2977
03:12:36,196 --> 03:12:37,099
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2978
03:12:37,099 --> 03:12:38,245
(all laugh)

2979
03:12:38,245 --> 03:12:39,626
TALIESIN: For those of you at home, this thing has
been just driving us nuts.

2980
03:12:39,626 --> 03:12:40,609
LAURA: It's been all night.

2981
03:12:40,609 --> 03:12:41,874
LIAM: It's a stirge.

2982
03:12:41,874 --> 03:12:42,848
TRAVIS: We had a bit of a run-in--

2983
03:12:42,848 --> 03:12:43,380
MATT: It's fine.

2984
03:12:43,380 --> 03:12:49,130
TRAVIS: -- and Doty may or may not have
paddy-caked some of the guards, so, like, we need

2985
03:12:49,130 --> 03:12:50,156
to remove--

2986
03:12:50,156 --> 03:12:52,839
SAM: (tearfully) Doty killed two guards. He just
killed them. They're dead.

2987
03:12:52,839 --> 03:12:53,866
TRAVIS: Well, there it is.

2988
03:12:53,866 --> 03:12:54,831
SAM: (tearfully) They're dead!

2989
03:12:54,831 --> 03:12:55,479
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2990
03:12:55,479 --> 03:12:56,352
SAM: (tearfully) He killed two guards.

2991
03:12:56,352 --> 03:12:57,062
LAURA: He killed them?

2992
03:12:57,062 --> 03:12:57,745
TRAVIS: He's been like this.

2993
03:12:57,745 --> 03:12:58,714
SAM: (tearfully) We didn't tell him to! He just
did.

2994
03:12:58,714 --> 03:12:59,621
LAURA: Did he really kill them?

2995
03:12:59,621 --> 03:13:01,273
LIAM: But did the disguise work?

2996
03:13:01,273 --> 03:13:04,117
SAM: I actually think it did. Actually.

2997
03:13:04,117 --> 03:13:06,222
TRAVIS: He's been doing this for about
half an hour, so--

2998
03:13:06,222 --> 03:13:08,043
TALIESIN: Half full. He'll have a glass of
something half full. Thank--

2999
03:13:08,220 --> 03:13:11,588
MARISHA: What? What did you tell Doty? What did
you inform him right before--

3000
03:13:11,588 --> 03:13:13,018
LIAM: Are you sure they were dead? Are they just
fucked up?

3001
03:13:13,018 --> 03:13:13,764
TRAVIS: I think they were--

3002
03:13:13,764 --> 03:13:14,719
MATT: Doty is writing all this down by the way.

3003
03:13:14,719 --> 03:13:16,121
MARISHA: Potentially murdered the-- Doty!

3004
03:13:16,121 --> 03:13:17,427
SAM: This is evidence, Doty!

3005
03:13:17,427 --> 03:13:19,375
MARISHA: I might-- Oh.

3006
03:13:19,375 --> 03:13:21,076
TRAVIS: Look, Percy. Vax.

3007
03:13:21,076 --> 03:13:21,775
SAM: Ugh.

3008
03:13:21,775 --> 03:13:22,728
LAURA: Dear diary.

3009
03:13:22,728 --> 03:13:23,579
TRAVIS: I think you you need to remove--

3010
03:13:23,579 --> 03:13:25,526
LAURA: I have an itty bitty metal penis.

3011
03:13:25,526 --> 03:13:27,831
(all laugh)

3012
03:13:27,831 --> 03:13:29,089
TRAVIS: You need to remove--

3013
03:13:29,089 --> 03:13:30,453
TALIESIN: Leave that there.

3014
03:13:30,453 --> 03:13:31,903
TRAVIS: -- Doty's disguise.

3015
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:32,766
TALIESIN: No.

3016
03:13:32,766 --> 03:13:35,627
SAM: No, no! Oh, because they might recognize him
as the murderer?

3017
03:13:35,627 --> 03:13:37,079
TRAVIS: Yeah. They'll be looking for a giant
red-haired--

3018
03:13:37,079 --> 03:13:37,877
TALIESIN: Wait.

3019
03:13:37,877 --> 03:13:38,897
TRAVIS: -- eight-foot-tall--

3020
03:13:38,897 --> 03:13:41,929
SAM: No. What we need to do is put another
disguise on top of this one.

3021
03:13:41,929 --> 03:13:44,089
(all laugh)

3022
03:13:44,089 --> 03:13:45,023
TRAVIS: You're right.

3023
03:13:45,023 --> 03:13:51,226
TALIESIN: Doty. Doty. Did you actually expire two
soldiers?

3024
03:13:52,698 --> 03:13:57,213
LAURA: As he's doing this, I pull out some
lipstick and I start drawing lipstick on his face,

3025
03:13:57,213 --> 03:13:59,549
to try to turn him boy to girl.

3026
03:13:59,549 --> 03:14:00,792
MATT: Doesn't resist.

3027
03:14:00,792 --> 03:14:02,271
TALIESIN: You ask and he listens to you.

3028
03:14:02,271 --> 03:14:03,694
LIAM: Is there a mop anywhere in the room?

3029
03:14:03,694 --> 03:14:04,365
MARISHA: What?

3030
03:14:04,365 --> 03:14:05,430
LIAM: In this room?

3031
03:14:05,430 --> 03:14:06,838
MATT: Not within visual--

3032
03:14:06,838 --> 03:14:07,698
LIAM: No.

3033
03:14:07,698 --> 03:14:09,520
MARISHA: You want me to ask Doty? Or you want me
to ask Tary?

3034
03:14:09,520 --> 03:14:10,546
MATT: -- vicinity. You could ask.

3035
03:14:10,546 --> 03:14:11,575
LIAM: What about drapes on the windows?

3036
03:14:11,575 --> 03:14:13,530
SAM: He won't answer any of you.

3037
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:14,683
TALIESIN: Ask him if he actually just hurt, or if
they're--

3038
03:14:14,683 --> 03:14:15,512
MATT: Not in this tavern, no.

3039
03:14:15,512 --> 03:14:16,421
MARISHA: -- just unconscious.

3040
03:14:16,421 --> 03:14:17,581
TALIESIN: Maybe he just punched them a couple
times.

3041
03:14:17,581 --> 03:14:18,384
SAM: Greg knows.

3042
03:14:18,384 --> 03:14:19,329
TRAVIS: Yep.

3043
03:14:19,329 --> 03:14:20,554
TALIESIN: Ah, that's close enough.

3044
03:14:20,554 --> 03:14:23,668
SAM: Did you kill them, with those punches of
fury?

3045
03:14:23,668 --> 03:14:24,721
TALIESIN: Did you?

3046
03:14:24,721 --> 03:14:25,724
TRAVIS: I did.

3047
03:14:25,724 --> 03:14:27,338
MARISHA: Are you sure? Did you check?

3048
03:14:27,338 --> 03:14:28,998
TRAVIS: I don't know. I'm really strong these
days.

3049
03:14:28,998 --> 03:14:30,142
MARISHA: Grog.

3050
03:14:30,142 --> 03:14:31,388
LIAM: Insight check Grog.

3051
03:14:31,388 --> 03:14:33,705
TALIESIN: I'm joining in on this insight check. I
call bullshit.

3052
03:14:33,705 --> 03:14:36,965
MATT: (laughs) Sure.

3053
03:14:36,965 --> 03:14:37,955
LIAM: Well, that's a one.

3054
03:14:37,955 --> 03:14:38,946
LAURA: (laughs)

3055
03:14:38,946 --> 03:14:39,997
LIAM: I'm not wasting Luck on it.

3056
03:14:39,997 --> 03:14:41,826
MATT: He fucking killed two people.

3057
03:14:41,826 --> 03:14:42,498
TALIESIN: 13.

3058
03:14:42,498 --> 03:14:43,533
LIAM: Jeez, man.

3059
03:14:43,533 --> 03:14:44,248
LAURA: Grog.

3060
03:14:44,248 --> 03:14:45,235
TRAVIS: It was like an act of mercy, really.

3061
03:14:45,235 --> 03:14:46,010
LIAM: Did they attack you?

3062
03:14:46,010 --> 03:14:47,084
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

3063
03:14:47,084 --> 03:14:47,975
TRAVIS: No, no.

3064
03:14:47,975 --> 03:14:49,452
SAM: Oh, boy.

3065
03:14:49,452 --> 03:14:50,943
LAURA: (nervous sound)

3066
03:14:50,943 --> 03:14:51,838
TRAVIS: 19.

3067
03:14:51,838 --> 03:14:52,631
(all laugh)

3068
03:14:52,631 --> 03:14:53,420
TALIESIN: Fuck.

3069
03:14:53,420 --> 03:14:54,681
MATT: Grog fucking killed two people!

3070
03:14:54,681 --> 03:14:55,392
TRAVIS: 20.

3071
03:14:55,392 --> 03:14:56,301
LAURA: What? 20!

3072
03:14:56,301 --> 03:14:57,312
LIAM: Why? Were you in danger?

3073
03:14:57,312 --> 03:14:59,029
LAURA: This is what happens when Pike isn't
around!

3074
03:14:59,029 --> 03:14:59,949
TRAVIS: No no.

3075
03:14:59,949 --> 03:15:00,602
LIAM: Why?

3076
03:15:00,602 --> 03:15:03,939
TRAVIS: Look, from what I understand, these guards
were attracted to the horrific disguise that Doty

3077
03:15:03,939 --> 03:15:09,404
had. He knocked them out, brought them in. I
checked for, like, a pulse, checked their knee

3078
03:15:09,404 --> 03:15:12,415
reflexes, and they were on death's door, so I just
finished the deal.

3079
03:15:12,415 --> 03:15:13,138
MARISHA: Okay--

3080
03:15:13,138 --> 03:15:14,071
TRAVIS: It was really merciful.

3081
03:15:14,071 --> 03:15:14,873
MARISHA: That doesn't--

3082
03:15:14,873 --> 03:15:16,209
TALIESIN: I'm feeling slightly better but slightly
worse?

3083
03:15:16,209 --> 03:15:17,138
LIAM: What a clusterfuck.

3084
03:15:17,138 --> 03:15:18,910
LAURA: Did anyone see you do it?

3085
03:15:18,910 --> 03:15:22,706
SAM: We're not sure, Doty did this outside without
us being--

3086
03:15:22,706 --> 03:15:25,370
LAURA: Doty, did anyone see you do that to the
guards?

3087
03:15:25,370 --> 03:15:30,256
SAM: He won't answer you. Doty, did anyone witness
your crime?

3088
03:15:30,256 --> 03:15:33,886
MATT: (squeaking "I don't know" sound)

3089
03:15:33,886 --> 03:15:39,662
MARISHA: Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell
him to-- he just did this on --

3090
03:15:39,662 --> 03:15:44,223
SAM: I told him to protect us! He's my protector.
He does what needs to be done to protect me.

3091
03:15:44,223 --> 03:15:47,906
MARISHA: (sighs) Tary, is this thing safe to be
following us around?

3092
03:15:47,906 --> 03:15:50,540
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, he's really impressive actually.
Have a little more respect.

3093
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:53,128
LAURA: Maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities.
Maybe that should just be a rule.

3094
03:15:53,128 --> 03:15:54,181
LIAM: Was there no other choice?

3095
03:15:54,181 --> 03:15:55,367
LAURA: Doty doesn't come into cities.

3096
03:15:55,367 --> 03:15:56,261
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, we weren't--

3097
03:15:56,261 --> 03:15:57,703
TALIESIN: We let the bear come into bars.

3098
03:15:57,703 --> 03:15:59,296
LAURA: Well, yeah, Trinket is well-behaved.

3099
03:15:59,296 --> 03:16:00,733
TALIESIN: That's fair.

3100
03:16:00,733 --> 03:16:02,132
LAURA: Doty kills people.

3101
03:16:02,132 --> 03:16:05,669
SAM: Well, to be fair, Greg killed the people.

3102
03:16:05,669 --> 03:16:06,788
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3103
03:16:06,788 --> 03:16:08,636
SAM: Doty merely roughed them up.

3104
03:16:08,636 --> 03:16:17,876
TRAVIS: And to be even more fair, they'd been
drinking all day. Smelled like alcohol.

3105
03:16:17,927 --> 03:16:20,274
(all laugh)

3106
03:16:20,274 --> 03:16:21,377
MATT: And he does.

3107
03:16:21,377 --> 03:16:22,351
TALIESIN: Are we still buying this?

3108
03:16:22,351 --> 03:16:23,498
MARISHA: No way we'd buy that delivery!

3109
03:16:23,498 --> 03:16:24,456
MATT: (laughs)

3110
03:16:24,456 --> 03:16:26,308
TRAVIS: You bet your ass you do, that's a 20!

3111
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:27,489
MARISHA: Can I roll an insight check? That's
bullshit!

3112
03:16:27,489 --> 03:16:28,280
TRAVIS: That's a 20!

3113
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:29,086
MATT: You can.

3114
03:16:29,086 --> 03:16:30,212
MARISHA: There's no fucking way!

3115
03:16:30,212 --> 03:16:31,102
MATT: You can, go ahead and make an insight
check.

3116
03:16:31,102 --> 03:16:32,376
MARISHA: What? Oh, bullshit. That was the most
bullshit delivery.

3117
03:16:32,376 --> 03:16:33,366
LAURA: Yeah, can I try? Can I try too?

3118
03:16:33,366 --> 03:16:34,578
TRAVIS: I'm never gonna roll that high again.

3119
03:16:34,578 --> 03:16:35,433
LIAM: Please, save us from this moral dilemma!

3120
03:16:35,433 --> 03:16:36,692
MARISHA: Mm, mm, 21!

3121
03:16:36,692 --> 03:16:37,372
LAURA: Oh!

3122
03:16:37,372 --> 03:16:40,887
MATT: You are the first person not to believe
Grog's story.

3123
03:16:41,415 --> 03:16:42,495
MARISHA: (quietly) Grog.

3124
03:16:42,495 --> 03:16:43,331
LAURA: (laughs)

3125
03:16:43,331 --> 03:16:44,300
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3126
03:16:44,300 --> 03:16:47,606
MARISHA: Do we need to make sure you're with an
adult from here on out? Can you not be trusted

3127
03:16:47,606 --> 03:16:49,244
alone with Tary?

3128
03:16:49,244 --> 03:16:50,761
LAURA: Did you buy potions?

3129
03:16:50,761 --> 03:16:53,784
SAM: I have quite a gift for you!

3130
03:16:53,784 --> 03:16:54,729
LAURA: For me?

3131
03:16:54,729 --> 03:16:55,434
MATT: It looks like a--

3132
03:16:55,434 --> 03:16:56,267
SAM: For all of you.

3133
03:16:56,267 --> 03:16:57,116
LAURA: Oh.

3134
03:16:57,116 --> 03:17:02,620
MARISHA: No, no! Do not! Do not be influenced by
his very generous act of kindness! That was so

3135
03:17:02,620 --> 03:17:03,905
kind of you!

3136
03:17:03,905 --> 03:17:04,921
SAM: I think you'll find something for everyone in
there.

3137
03:17:04,921 --> 03:17:06,320
TRAVIS: Is there a little bit of vomit on there?

3138
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:07,989
MATT: Like a little. Spatter. It's dried by now.

3139
03:17:07,989 --> 03:17:10,117
MARISHA: That was like 6,000 gold worth of-- But
do not! Don't!

3140
03:17:10,117 --> 03:17:11,485
TALIESIN: Is this blood on the-- yep--

3141
03:17:11,485 --> 03:17:12,465
TRAVIS: No, that's vomit.

3142
03:17:12,465 --> 03:17:13,542
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good.

3143
03:17:13,542 --> 03:17:14,298
TRAVIS: Yup.

3144
03:17:14,298 --> 03:17:16,117
LIAM: We are skipping past the fact that two men
are dead right now.

3145
03:17:16,117 --> 03:17:17,252
LAURA: (sighs)

3146
03:17:17,252 --> 03:17:19,229
LIAM: Do we need to go and find them? And try
to--

3147
03:17:19,229 --> 03:17:21,382
LAURA: Do we need to go find these dead guys?

3148
03:17:21,382 --> 03:17:22,164
TRAVIS: Nope.

3149
03:17:22,164 --> 03:17:23,231
MARISHA: Are you sure they're dead?

3150
03:17:23,231 --> 03:17:24,615
TRAVIS: I forgot where I left them.

3151
03:17:24,615 --> 03:17:27,150
MARISHA: Grog--

3152
03:17:27,150 --> 03:17:28,350
LIAM: This is upsetting.

3153
03:17:28,350 --> 03:17:35,841
SAM: I know where they are, but the situation was
fluid, and it was fast-moving. And we acted on our

3154
03:17:35,841 --> 03:17:41,152
best instincts and our best judgment, and
mistakes were made.

3155
03:17:41,222 --> 03:17:42,436
TRAVIS: Yeah. Mm-hm.

3156
03:17:42,436 --> 03:17:45,866
MARISHA: Tary, it sounds like all of the opposite
of that is true.

3157
03:17:45,866 --> 03:17:47,107
SAM: When you're an adventurer--

3158
03:17:47,107 --> 03:17:48,232
LAURA: Except for mistakes.

3159
03:17:48,232 --> 03:17:49,522
MARISHA: Except for the mistakes part, yeah.

3160
03:17:49,522 --> 03:17:54,203
SAM: When you're an adventurer, you have to learn
to live with a certain amount of bloodshed around

3161
03:17:54,203 --> 03:18:04,804
you, and I think what Greg has told me today--what
he has taught me was to toughen me up. And I

3162
03:18:04,804 --> 03:18:09,247
appreciate him for that and I appreciate the
lesson. And I appreciate you all for sending me

3163
03:18:09,247 --> 03:18:12,341
out with him, knowing full well that that would
happen.

3164
03:18:12,341 --> 03:18:17,938
LAURA: Don't kill people in cities! Don't kill
people!

3165
03:18:17,938 --> 03:18:22,928
SAM: I still haven't-- I-- okay.

3166
03:18:22,928 --> 03:18:26,132
LAURA: Don't kill people!

3167
03:18:26,132 --> 03:18:27,753
TRAVIS: Who killed anybody?

3168
03:18:27,753 --> 03:18:28,474
LAURA: Grog!

3169
03:18:28,474 --> 03:18:29,302
MARISHA: Vax?

3170
03:18:29,302 --> 03:18:30,085
LAURA: Did you--

3171
03:18:30,085 --> 03:18:31,319
TRAVIS: What?

3172
03:18:31,319 --> 03:18:34,012
LAURA: You didn't kill anyone, did you?

3173
03:18:34,012 --> 03:18:36,290
LIAM: Of course he did, he looked us in the eye
and he said he killed two people! We should go

3174
03:18:36,290 --> 03:18:37,171
find them.

3175
03:18:37,171 --> 03:18:38,339
TRAVIS: Yep. They're dead.

3176
03:18:38,339 --> 03:18:40,250
LAURA: I don't believe him. Can I roll an insight
check?

3177
03:18:40,250 --> 03:18:42,592
MATT: Sure.

3178
03:18:42,592 --> 03:18:43,568
LAURA: Oh no.

3179
03:18:43,568 --> 03:18:44,567
TALIESIN: Whose vomit was this?

3180
03:18:44,567 --> 03:18:45,403
LAURA: Oh no!

3181
03:18:45,403 --> 03:18:47,646
LAURA and LIAM: (laughs)

3182
03:18:47,646 --> 03:18:48,549
MATT: What did you roll?

3183
03:18:48,549 --> 03:18:50,061
LAURA: I believe him!

3184
03:18:50,061 --> 03:18:50,697
MATT: What'd you roll?

3185
03:18:50,697 --> 03:18:53,335
LAURA: I believe him so good! 11!

3186
03:18:53,335 --> 03:18:54,286
TALIESIN: This game is a nightmare.

3187
03:18:54,286 --> 03:18:55,730
MATT: Grog fucking killed two people!

3188
03:18:55,730 --> 03:18:56,578
LAURA: Oh my God! Grog!

3189
03:18:56,578 --> 03:18:57,409
LIAM: That's it.

3190
03:18:57,409 --> 03:19:00,444
TRAVIS: Look, I was trying to protect our new
friend here. It had to be done.

3191
03:19:00,444 --> 03:19:02,072
LIAM: Where was this place? Where was this place?

3192
03:19:02,072 --> 03:19:03,562
LAURA: Ugh, we're never going to be able to come
back to Vasselheim!

3193
03:19:03,562 --> 03:19:07,446
LIAM: We have to find these two men and bring them
to a temple or something, we can't just leave them--

3194
03:19:07,446 --> 03:19:12,468
SAM: It was a potion seller, it was a medicinal,
herbalist or something--

3195
03:19:12,468 --> 03:19:13,273
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3196
03:19:13,273 --> 03:19:14,330
LIAM: Can you guide me there?

3197
03:19:14,330 --> 03:19:16,605
MARISHA: Oh, you did not go to that guy, the guy
who-- oh no.

3198
03:19:16,605 --> 03:19:17,562
TALIESIN: Did you go to that guy?

3199
03:19:17,562 --> 03:19:18,425
SAM: It seems to be--

3200
03:19:18,425 --> 03:19:21,276
TRAVIS: He did say he wanted to see the twins,
especially.

3201
03:19:21,276 --> 03:19:22,259
SAM: That is not--

3202
03:19:22,259 --> 03:19:25,391
LIAM: Look, listen, take me to this place. You and
I will carry these men to a temple.

3203
03:19:25,391 --> 03:19:27,874
SAM: And do what? What they did to you?

3204
03:19:27,874 --> 03:19:30,050
LIAM: We will-- what happened to me?

3205
03:19:30,050 --> 03:19:32,190
SAM: Well, you were revived, from death.

3206
03:19:32,190 --> 03:19:37,252
LIAM: Well, I can't do that. And you can't do
that, so we need to take these men to a temple

3207
03:19:37,252 --> 03:19:38,525
where somebody can help them!

3208
03:19:38,525 --> 03:19:41,228
TRAVIS: Oh, God, look, fine, they're not dead!

3209
03:19:41,228 --> 03:19:42,290
LAURA: I don't believe you.

3210
03:19:42,290 --> 03:19:46,756
TRAVIS: (sighs) No, I just knocked the life out of
them, but they're not dead, right, wiretapping

3211
03:19:46,756 --> 03:19:49,081
does not mean dead, all right?

3212
03:19:49,081 --> 03:19:50,745
(all laugh)

3213
03:19:50,745 --> 03:19:51,821
SAM: It was in quotations.

3214
03:19:51,821 --> 03:19:52,747
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3215
03:19:52,747 --> 03:19:53,970
SAM and TRAVIS: Dead.

3216
03:19:53,970 --> 03:20:00,782
TRAVIS: Okay, look, they're fine, they might be
covered in beer, we don't really need to go back

3217
03:20:00,782 --> 03:20:01,507
for them.

3218
03:20:01,507 --> 03:20:02,368
MARISHA: Insight check!

3219
03:20:02,368 --> 03:20:03,451
LAURA: Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed
them.

3220
03:20:03,451 --> 03:20:05,253
MARISHA: Now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf
three times.

3221
03:20:05,253 --> 03:20:06,816
MATT: Go for it. Roll insight, both you guys.

3222
03:20:06,816 --> 03:20:08,423
MARISHA: God damn it, don't fuck me, Gil.

3223
03:20:08,423 --> 03:20:10,218
LAURA: Oh, I rolled Gil, too!

3224
03:20:10,218 --> 03:20:12,250
MARISHA: Oh, jeez, that wasn't great.

3225
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:14,089
LAURA: I got it. I got you covered.

3226
03:20:14,089 --> 03:20:14,821
MARISHA: 15.

3227
03:20:14,821 --> 03:20:15,697
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

3228
03:20:15,697 --> 03:20:17,261
TRAVIS: They didn't ask you to roll, Taliesin.

3229
03:20:17,261 --> 03:20:18,450
LAURA: 24!

3230
03:20:18,450 --> 03:20:22,259
MATT: No, you guys get at this point that Grog's
been fucking with you.

3231
03:20:22,259 --> 03:20:23,898
LAURA: You fucking dick!

3232
03:20:23,898 --> 03:20:24,758
TRAVIS: Yep.

3233
03:20:24,758 --> 03:20:26,775
(all laugh)

3234
03:20:26,775 --> 03:20:28,830
LAURA: No, but seriously, you still attacked the
guards, right?

3235
03:20:28,830 --> 03:20:29,518
TRAVIS: He did.

3236
03:20:29,518 --> 03:20:30,971
LAURA: That's still really bad.

3237
03:20:30,971 --> 03:20:32,571
TALIESIN: Whose vomit is this?

3238
03:20:32,571 --> 03:20:35,774
LIAM: So those guys aren't dead, is what you're
saying? Those two guys are not dead?

3239
03:20:35,774 --> 03:20:36,991
LAURA and TRAVIS: They're not dead.

3240
03:20:36,991 --> 03:20:38,117
LIAM: All right, that's kind of funny.

3241
03:20:38,117 --> 03:20:44,311
TALIESIN: I still feel like I would like an answer
to the mystery of the vomit.

3242
03:20:44,561 --> 03:20:48,913
LAURA: At least Doty was in disguise. No one will
recognize him. Just take the disguise off him now.

3243
03:20:48,913 --> 03:20:51,294
TRAVIS: That's what I said like five minutes ago.

3244
03:20:51,294 --> 03:20:53,413
LAURA: Take the disguise off of him.

3245
03:20:53,413 --> 03:20:56,082
MARISHA: That looks like Tary's vomit.

3246
03:20:56,147 --> 03:20:57,180
TALIESIN: How can you tell?

3247
03:20:57,180 --> 03:21:00,832
MARISHA: Because I saw him puke under the water
and it floated right past me. I got a great view

3248
03:21:00,832 --> 03:21:04,152
of it. He's a nervous puker.

3249
03:21:04,152 --> 03:21:07,114
LIAM: What is better in this town? A disgusting
mess or a robit?

3250
03:21:07,114 --> 03:21:08,264
LAURA: A robit?

3251
03:21:08,264 --> 03:21:10,213
LIAM: An automaton.

3252
03:21:10,213 --> 03:21:11,218
LAURA: It's necromancy.

3253
03:21:11,218 --> 03:21:12,238
LIAM: An ottoman.

3254
03:21:12,238 --> 03:21:13,164
LAURA: Yes.

3255
03:21:13,164 --> 03:21:14,738
SAM: I think I need a drink.

3256
03:21:14,738 --> 03:21:17,709
LAURA: (gasps)

3257
03:21:17,709 --> 03:21:19,352
SAM: What?

3258
03:21:19,352 --> 03:21:21,825
LAURA: What?

3259
03:21:21,825 --> 03:21:24,851
TALIESIN: I pour him a little bit of the Tear
Whiskey.

3260
03:21:24,851 --> 03:21:27,109
TRAVIS: How did you guys do?

3261
03:21:27,109 --> 03:21:28,683
LIAM: Oh, great.

3262
03:21:28,683 --> 03:21:30,154
LAURA: We thought we had a book.

3263
03:21:30,154 --> 03:21:31,242
TRAVIS: But you don't?

3264
03:21:31,410 --> 03:21:32,462
LAURA: But we didn't.

3265
03:21:32,631 --> 03:21:35,747
LIAM: We left without the book, thinking we had
the book, and then we lied about not having the

3266
03:21:35,747 --> 03:21:38,300
book, but we actually didn't have it.

3267
03:21:38,300 --> 03:21:41,636
MARISHA: But it seems like it might be okay,
right?

3268
03:21:41,636 --> 03:21:42,820
TRAVIS: Got that motherfucker.

3269
03:21:42,820 --> 03:21:43,614
LAURA: Did you?

3270
03:21:43,614 --> 03:21:49,315
MARISHA: Did you get it? Yeah! Real-life hero.

3271
03:21:49,315 --> 03:21:52,667
MATT: Two guards alive. That is fucking dead

3272
03:21:52,667 --> 03:21:54,666
(all laugh)

3273
03:21:54,666 --> 03:21:56,572
LAURA: I say we get Doty's disguise off of him.

3274
03:21:56,572 --> 03:21:57,659
TALIESIN: All right.

3275
03:21:57,659 --> 03:21:59,627
LAURA: I say we go to sleep.

3276
03:21:59,627 --> 03:22:01,022
LIAM: I start peeling it away.

3277
03:22:01,022 --> 03:22:02,287
SAM: And then what?

3278
03:22:02,287 --> 03:22:04,357
LAURA: Then we get up in the morning, and we pick
up our pretty dresses.

3279
03:22:04,357 --> 03:22:05,258
MARISHA: Yeah.

3280
03:22:05,258 --> 03:22:10,685
LAURA: And we go get you crowned! So we can wear
our pretty dresses.

3281
03:22:10,685 --> 03:22:12,744
TALIESIN: Keep drinking.

3282
03:22:12,744 --> 03:22:16,537
MATT: Everything but the hair comes off. The mask,
the porcelain, everything else comes off.

3283
03:22:16,537 --> 03:22:17,875
LAURA: What about the cloak?

3284
03:22:17,875 --> 03:22:19,886
MATT: The cloak does not come off.

3285
03:22:19,886 --> 03:22:20,971
LAURA: No!

3286
03:22:20,971 --> 03:22:23,454
MATT: Not from just tugging it. It's adhered
pretty strongly.

3287
03:22:23,454 --> 03:22:26,310
LIAM: This is so fucking terrible. I'm so angry.

3288
03:22:26,310 --> 03:22:28,527
(all laugh)

3289
03:22:28,527 --> 03:22:35,710
MARISHA: Tary, going forward, I think you need to
recognize how literal Doty takes things, and maybe

3290
03:22:35,710 --> 03:22:43,656
think maybe more detailedly on how you word
things, maybe?

3291
03:22:43,656 --> 03:22:46,137
SAM: Doty did his job. He protected us.

3292
03:22:46,137 --> 03:22:48,115
MARISHA: From innocent guards.

3293
03:22:48,115 --> 03:22:50,428
SAM: Who were going to arrest us.

3294
03:22:50,428 --> 03:22:52,824
LAURA: Why were they going to arrest you?

3295
03:22:52,824 --> 03:22:56,571
SAM: Because we were arcanists walking loose in
the--

3296
03:22:56,571 --> 03:22:57,933
LAURA: It's not illegal!

3297
03:22:57,933 --> 03:23:07,390
SAM: I was led to believe it was. And I'm a
stranger in this land, and they were trailing us,

3298
03:23:07,390 --> 03:23:14,985
and your cohort over there, the big guy himself,
told me that they were a danger to us, and Doty

3299
03:23:14,985 --> 03:23:22,325
did his job. Listen, you can't blame Doty for the
mistakes that I may have made. I take full

3300
03:23:22,325 --> 03:23:31,194
responsibility for this, and I throw myself at
your feet for mercy. I know I'm new to this team,

3301
03:23:31,194 --> 03:23:39,607
and I hoped that this gift would be a peacemaking
gesture. By the way, you should divide all these

3302
03:23:39,607 --> 03:23:41,729
potions up as you see fit.

3303
03:23:41,729 --> 03:23:43,740
LAURA: We totally should.

3304
03:23:43,740 --> 03:23:55,789
SAM: And I'm sorry if I made mistakes today. But
we're all alive, we have what we need, and we're

3305
03:23:55,789 --> 03:23:58,976
still on an adventure, right?

3306
03:23:58,976 --> 03:24:02,397
TALIESIN: A toast to mistakes--

3307
03:24:02,397 --> 03:24:04,824
SAM: Let's all sing our fight song, shall we?

3308
03:24:04,824 --> 03:24:07,644
TALIESIN: -- and to terrible consequences, to
failure.

3309
03:24:07,644 --> 03:24:09,292
LAURA: How about you go first, Tary.

3310
03:24:09,292 --> 03:24:11,466
MARISHA: Yes, let's learn it from you.

3311
03:24:11,538 --> 03:24:23,299
SAM: Doty, show me what we wrote. (sings) 'Seven
intrepid warriors we, were strong before and

3312
03:24:23,299 --> 03:24:33,818
'stronger with me. Drinking wine and Heroes'
Feasts, saving maidens, defeating beasts. We

3313
03:24:33,818 --> 03:24:44,071
'fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth, I
slew a marid and proved my worth. Vix and Vox,

3314
03:24:44,071 --> 03:24:58,320
'Kiko and Greg, and Percival with the head like an
egg. I defeated a kraken too, and I saved the

3315
03:24:58,320 --> 03:25:06,799
'Ashari single-handedly in the ocean blue. We
fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth. I

3316
03:25:06,799 --> 03:25:12,368
'won your hearts and I proved my worth.'

3317
03:25:12,368 --> 03:25:14,230
TALIESIN: Ooh. Bravo!

3318
03:25:14,230 --> 03:25:16,639
LAURA: Hey!

3319
03:25:16,639 --> 03:25:19,865
SAM: Now you all have fight songs too, don't you?

3320
03:25:19,865 --> 03:25:22,954
TALIESIN: We'll cover that at the next drink. I
think it's time to turn in.

3321
03:25:22,954 --> 03:25:24,225
MARISHA: Hm, yes.

3322
03:25:24,225 --> 03:25:25,170
LAURA: Wow.

3323
03:25:25,170 --> 03:25:28,263
TALIESIN: I'm going to run-- I'm going to get a
little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have,

3324
03:25:28,263 --> 03:25:32,971
preferably a clear alcohol, and ask them if they
have any chicken, like-- or some sort of meat that

3325
03:25:32,971 --> 03:25:34,733
they're about to throw away.

3326
03:25:34,733 --> 03:25:37,630
LAURA: Oh. Chicken.

3327
03:25:37,630 --> 03:25:38,909
TALIESIN: Stop it.

3328
03:25:38,909 --> 03:25:43,263
MATT: They do have some near-spoiling meat. And at
the cost of one gold piece you can get a pretty

3329
03:25:43,263 --> 03:25:44,374
solid bottle.

3330
03:25:44,374 --> 03:25:51,675
TALIESIN: I pop it and I'm just going to try and
start solventing away the glue with grease, with

3331
03:25:51,675 --> 03:25:54,319
fatty grease and alcohol.

3332
03:25:54,319 --> 03:25:57,273
MATT: It'll take you the better part of the
next couple of hours, but you can do it.

3333
03:25:57,321 --> 03:26:00,931
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to try and get this
thing off. Let me try and remove the hair too.

3334
03:26:00,931 --> 03:26:05,859
MATT: You do manage to get the hair off. You don't
get all the glue splotches. Doty now has these,

3335
03:26:05,859 --> 03:26:11,962
like, clusters of nasty-looking glue splotches all
over the head. And of like, taken pieces of

3336
03:26:12,016 --> 03:26:18,162
thread, and fuzz, and dirt and things just from
the atmosphere to him. It looks awful. Doty looks

3337
03:26:18,162 --> 03:26:22,115
awful. But the cloak does come off.

3338
03:26:23,253 --> 03:26:24,849
TALIESIN: We'll have it cleaned, dear.

3339
03:26:24,849 --> 03:26:28,782
LAURA: That's amazing. So worth it, darling, I
can't believe you did that. Thank you.

3340
03:26:28,782 --> 03:26:31,317
LIAM: Does the cloak of Elvenkind look like butt?

3341
03:26:31,317 --> 03:26:32,746
LAURA: It's got clumps of red hair stuck.

3342
03:26:32,746 --> 03:26:36,479
MATT: Only like 10% butt. Like, there is still
glue on it. You have to spend more time.

3343
03:26:36,479 --> 03:26:37,437
LIAM: It worked?

3344
03:26:37,437 --> 03:26:38,428
SAM: Did we take off the mask?

3345
03:26:38,428 --> 03:26:39,830
MATT: If you want to.

3346
03:26:39,830 --> 03:26:41,288
TALIESIN: It looks like the kindergarten class
attacked it.

3347
03:26:41,288 --> 03:26:42,002
MARISHA: Yeah.

3348
03:26:42,002 --> 03:26:43,020
SAM: Should we take off the mask?

3349
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:43,798
LAURA: Probably.

3350
03:26:43,798 --> 03:26:44,443
TALIESIN: Fucker.

3351
03:26:44,443 --> 03:26:45,633
SAM and TALIESIN: There's another one!

3352
03:26:45,633 --> 03:26:47,081
(all laugh)

3353
03:26:47,132 --> 03:26:50,032
MATT: It's like a hydra, Travis killed one, two
more took its place.

3354
03:26:50,032 --> 03:26:51,531
TRAVIS: It's so strange man, they go up, they come
back down.

3355
03:26:51,531 --> 03:26:56,239
TALIESIN: Arsehole, where did you go? Fuck.
They're huge. Sorry. That was really

3356
03:26:56,239 --> 03:26:58,700
inappropriate.

3357
03:26:58,700 --> 03:27:00,727
MATT: So, as you guys get tired, you could rent a
room for the evening.

3358
03:27:00,727 --> 03:27:01,693
LAURA: Yeah.

3359
03:27:01,693 --> 03:27:02,984
MATT: At the tavern if you'd like, the Siren's
Succor.

3360
03:27:02,984 --> 03:27:04,468
LAURA: Okay, let's rent a room.

3361
03:27:04,468 --> 03:27:08,688
MATT: Okay. So, I'd say for the rooms for all of
you guys tonight, drinking there, mark off ten

3362
03:27:08,688 --> 03:27:10,673
gold, it's fine.

3363
03:27:10,673 --> 03:27:12,248
SAM: For everyone, or each.

3364
03:27:12,248 --> 03:27:12,918
LAURA: For everyone.

3365
03:27:12,918 --> 03:27:13,708
MATT: For everyone.

3366
03:27:13,708 --> 03:27:14,672
SAM: Pf.

3367
03:27:14,672 --> 03:27:15,331
TALIESIN: I know.

3368
03:27:15,331 --> 03:27:16,075
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3369
03:27:16,075 --> 03:27:17,593
SAM: I can take care of this, if you'd like.

3370
03:27:17,593 --> 03:27:18,845
TALIESIN: No, we got this. It's okay.

3371
03:27:18,845 --> 03:27:20,424
LAURA: We've got it. It's fine, Tary.

3372
03:27:20,424 --> 03:27:21,542
TALIESIN: But part of being--

3373
03:27:21,542 --> 03:27:26,610
LIAM: You buy the potions, we pay for the shitty
hotel rooms.

3374
03:27:26,610 --> 03:27:31,644
SAM: (laughs) I don't know if that evens out. But
all right.

3375
03:27:31,644 --> 03:27:36,310
TALIESIN: Don't think of it as a thing that evens
out, think of it as an ever-increasing debt that

3376
03:27:36,310 --> 03:27:39,147
doesn't really ever get paid.

3377
03:27:39,147 --> 03:27:40,979
SAM: I like the way you think, science bro.

3378
03:27:40,979 --> 03:27:42,721
TALIESIN: Cheers.

3379
03:27:42,721 --> 03:27:53,242
MATT: All righty. As you guys rest for the
evening, the morning comes around. You're across

3380
03:27:53,242 --> 03:27:57,317
the board, fairly hung-over, but functional.
Except for Grog, Grog, you're fine. Yay

3381
03:27:57,317 --> 03:28:04,945
constitution 20! But you guys muster yourselves,
get a quick bite to eat downstairs, in the now

3382
03:28:04,996 --> 03:28:13,105
even-more-empty tavern. Your dresses are at the
ready, you go and collect them. What's next, what

3383
03:28:13,105 --> 03:28:16,303
do you guys want to do?

3384
03:28:17,121 --> 03:28:19,155
LAURA: We should go to see your people.

3385
03:28:19,155 --> 03:28:20,850
MARISHA: I mean, we could catch brunch first?

3386
03:28:20,850 --> 03:28:23,121
LAURA: No. We should go to see. Your. People.

3387
03:28:23,121 --> 03:28:23,837
TALIESIN: No.

3388
03:28:23,837 --> 03:28:24,420
LIAM: No.

3389
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:26,520
MARISHA: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Let's go.

3390
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:28,488
LIAM: No time like the present.

3391
03:28:28,488 --> 03:28:31,248
LAURA: Wait, what are the colors of Whitestone
again?

3392
03:28:31,248 --> 03:28:35,098
TALIESIN: Lavender, white, blue, gold, silver.

3393
03:28:35,098 --> 03:28:36,913
LAURA: That's the colors I want my dress to be.

3394
03:28:36,913 --> 03:28:38,052
TRAVIS: That's five.

3395
03:28:38,052 --> 03:28:38,837
MATT: Okay.

3396
03:28:38,841 --> 03:28:40,115
LIAM: It's too late, it's black.

3397
03:28:40,115 --> 03:28:41,851
(all laugh)

3398
03:28:41,851 --> 03:28:46,449
TALIESIN: I might add, you do-- Part of taking a
crest is that you actually do get to build

3399
03:28:46,449 --> 03:28:48,863
something of your own.

3400
03:28:48,863 --> 03:28:50,642
LAURA: We need to work on that, Percival.

3401
03:28:50,642 --> 03:28:56,806
TALIESIN: We do. I was-- I feel like I've been
negligent. That we've not been--

3402
03:28:56,806 --> 03:28:59,680
LAURA: You also need to explain to me what
the fucking Grey Hunt is at some point.

3403
03:28:59,734 --> 03:29:06,683
TALIESIN: Yes, we should get to that. I only
know because we've talked about that.

3404
03:29:06,737 --> 03:29:08,171
MATT: Yeah. All right.

3405
03:29:08,171 --> 03:29:09,788
LAURA: Come on, let's go, Keyleth.

3406
03:29:09,788 --> 03:29:12,418
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go.

3407
03:29:12,418 --> 03:29:14,301
LAURA: Antlers upon antlers.

3408
03:29:14,301 --> 03:29:20,413
MATT: All right. And such. With the Transport Via
Plants spell cast into the nearest tree, you guys

3409
03:29:20,413 --> 03:29:24,416
find yourself emerging from one of the
cliffside trees that have grown out of the

3410
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:32,345
outcropping of stone and rock that marks the
exterior of Zephra. Did you all travel here last

3411
03:29:32,345 --> 03:29:34,054
time, or was it just Keyleth and Vax?

3412
03:29:34,054 --> 03:29:36,945
MARISHA: It was just Vax and Allura--

3413
03:29:36,945 --> 03:29:38,652
MATT: Yeah, Vax. Allura, that's right.

3414
03:29:38,652 --> 03:29:39,313
TALIESIN: Ooh.

3415
03:29:39,313 --> 03:29:41,078
MARISHA: Whom we kind of forgot was with us.
(nervous laugh)

3416
03:29:41,078 --> 03:29:42,523
MATT: That's right, and she was like, "Whatever."

3417
03:29:42,523 --> 03:29:43,664
MARISHA: Yeah.

3418
03:29:43,664 --> 03:29:49,578
MATT: All right, so you guys all emerge, and you
see now, on these extremely tall mountain bluffs,

3419
03:29:49,578 --> 03:29:57,565
the wind is strong on the outskirts, and you can
see, whizzing past you, puffs of cloud, and leaf,

3420
03:29:57,565 --> 03:30:03,316
and dust. But it's all contained on the outside of
this bluff. And before you on the opposite side,

3421
03:30:03,316 --> 03:30:10,058
built deep into this mountain top, you can see
dozens and dozens of structures made from the

3422
03:30:10,058 --> 03:30:15,416
natural stone and bending of long wood slats that
seem to have been curved over into these dome-like

3423
03:30:15,416 --> 03:30:22,245
structures. You see small trees emerging in
places, and even though you are a few hundred feet

3424
03:30:22,245 --> 03:30:28,991
off, you can already see maybe 20 or so various
people just wandering the town, some of which are

3425
03:30:28,991 --> 03:30:35,437
outside working on-- sitting on benches, working on
various crafts. You can see leathers being dried

3426
03:30:35,502 --> 03:30:42,778
out from various hides. You catch the sight of a
griffin that swoops past and disappears into a

3427
03:30:42,778 --> 03:30:46,664
nearby cloud. And looking over the bluff--

3428
03:30:46,664 --> 03:30:47,438
SAM: Cool.

3429
03:30:47,438 --> 03:30:51,631
MATT: -- about ten feet off, this is the drop, goes
down for hundreds of feet before vanishing into

3430
03:30:51,683 --> 03:30:57,717
low-hanging clouds. You guys have no idea how high
up you are, but it seems very high.

3431
03:30:57,717 --> 03:31:00,865
MARISHA: (inhales) Oh man.

3432
03:31:00,865 --> 03:31:01,955
SAM: Are we falling?

3433
03:31:01,955 --> 03:31:03,210
LAURA: Is it super windy?

3434
03:31:03,210 --> 03:31:04,305
MARISHA: No no no, we're on the mountain.

3435
03:31:04,305 --> 03:31:06,959
MATT: You can see a lot of wind rushing just
around you, but it seems like this portion of the

3436
03:31:06,959 --> 03:31:13,420
mountain is almost protected, or at least the
winds are guided in a way where they're not

3437
03:31:13,420 --> 03:31:16,205
affecting this portion of the mountain.

3438
03:31:17,822 --> 03:31:19,208
LAURA: So what do we do?

3439
03:31:19,208 --> 03:31:20,714
LIAM: What happens now, boss?

3440
03:31:20,714 --> 03:31:26,426
MARISHA: I forgot you guys haven't seen my
hometown yet. Okay, all right. Let's go that way.

3441
03:31:26,426 --> 03:31:31,981
Okay. See, over there is where I caught
my first baby griffin--

3442
03:31:31,981 --> 03:31:33,090
TALIESIN: Oh no.

3443
03:31:33,090 --> 03:31:36,622
MARISHA: -- he was lost and got separated from his
mom, and I captured him up, and I tucked him up under

3444
03:31:36,622 --> 03:31:39,300
my shirt. And over there actually--

3445
03:31:39,300 --> 03:31:40,366
TALIESIN: (groans)

3446
03:31:40,366 --> 03:31:42,756
MARISHA: -- I tripped and fell and that was the
first time that I scraped my knee--

3447
03:31:42,756 --> 03:31:43,770
SAM: Amazing.

3448
03:31:43,770 --> 03:31:45,098
MARISHA: -- and I was like, oh no, I'm bleeding.

3449
03:31:45,098 --> 03:31:46,174
SAM: It must have been terrible.

3450
03:31:46,174 --> 03:31:48,503
LAURA: While she was walking, I go behind and do
this to Vax.

3451
03:31:48,503 --> 03:31:49,363
MARISHA: Oh, it was so terrible, yeah.

3452
03:31:49,363 --> 03:31:49,954
LIAM: Ow.

3453
03:31:49,954 --> 03:31:50,719
LAURA: Does it still hurt?

3454
03:31:50,719 --> 03:31:52,503
LIAM: No it's fine, I feel good. I feel really
good.

3455
03:31:52,503 --> 03:31:53,206
LAURA: Yeah?

3456
03:31:53,206 --> 03:31:59,185
LIAM: Yeah, I feel really good. I feel rested. I
feel fucking healthy man. I don't know. I'm

3457
03:31:59,185 --> 03:32:01,634
serious.

3458
03:32:01,634 --> 03:32:05,179
LAURA: All right, that's happy.

3459
03:32:05,179 --> 03:32:06,375
LIAM: (growls)

3460
03:32:06,375 --> 03:32:07,970
LAURA: (growls)

3461
03:32:07,970 --> 03:32:14,923
MATT: As you guys are walking closer to the
outside of Zephra, you see a couple of individuals

3462
03:32:14,923 --> 03:32:19,328
beginning to approach, three or four children,
just seeing these strange visitors in the

3463
03:32:19,328 --> 03:32:25,232
outskirts. They're also keeping low and not trying
to draw your attention too strongly, though they

3464
03:32:25,232 --> 03:32:30,806
are out in the middle of the open. You see a few
bushes and elements. You see two grown individuals

3465
03:32:30,806 --> 03:32:38,598
walking up with the children, one of which appears
to be a relatively young girl, maybe around 13, 14

3466
03:32:38,598 --> 03:32:44,992
years old who pushes the kids to the back and
goes, "Keyleth?"

3467
03:32:45,427 --> 03:32:49,162
MARISHA: Yes, hi, hi. What's your name?

3468
03:32:49,162 --> 03:32:52,974
MATT: "Sora. You used to watch over me when I was
little."

3469
03:32:52,974 --> 03:32:59,901
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, Sora. Wow, last time I
saw you, you were like, like, oh man. Look how big

3470
03:32:59,901 --> 03:33:01,594
you've gotten.

3471
03:33:01,594 --> 03:33:02,665
MATT: "I--"

3472
03:33:02,665 --> 03:33:07,185
MARISHA: Do you still know that handshake? Do you
remember the--

3473
03:33:07,185 --> 03:33:08,734
MATT: It takes a moment for you guys to figure it
out.

3474
03:33:08,734 --> 03:33:10,590
MARISHA: And there, you've got it. You got it.

3475
03:33:10,590 --> 03:33:12,270
MATT: It's slightly awkward, but for the most part
you recall it.

3476
03:33:12,270 --> 03:33:13,230
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3477
03:33:13,230 --> 03:33:14,402
MATT: "I'm much older now, I don't need to--"

3478
03:33:14,402 --> 03:33:15,074
MARISHA: Oh man.

3479
03:33:15,074 --> 03:33:15,991
MATT: "I didn't--"

3480
03:33:15,991 --> 03:33:16,628
MARISHA: You forgot--

3481
03:33:16,628 --> 03:33:17,627
MATT: "You're back."

3482
03:33:17,627 --> 03:33:21,145
MARISHA: Yeah. I guess I am.

3483
03:33:21,145 --> 03:33:24,268
MATT: "We have to tell everyone else."

3484
03:33:24,268 --> 03:33:25,832
MARISHA: Hey, hey.

3485
03:33:25,832 --> 03:33:29,062
MATT: The kids are all just quietly staring
wide-eyed and smiling quietly.

3486
03:33:29,062 --> 03:33:33,701
MARISHA: Sora, Sora. Have you seen my dad around?

3487
03:33:33,701 --> 03:33:35,572
MATT: "Do you want me to get him?"

3488
03:33:35,572 --> 03:33:36,316
MARISHA: Yeah.

3489
03:33:36,316 --> 03:33:36,990
MATT: "Okay."

3490
03:33:36,990 --> 03:33:37,752
MARISHA: Okay.

3491
03:33:37,752 --> 03:33:40,613
MATT: "C'mon, c'mon kids." And takes them by the
hand and they all drag the kids off as you guys

3492
03:33:40,613 --> 03:33:44,524
wait in the outskirts of the city. One of the kids
who didn't quite get a hand on this young

3493
03:33:44,524 --> 03:33:49,330
three-year-old boy who's running behind them
stops. Turns and stares at you all, but stares

3494
03:33:49,330 --> 03:33:53,775
specifically at Grog and is just wide-eyed,
going--

3495
03:33:54,300 --> 03:33:55,793
TRAVIS: Hey.

3496
03:33:55,793 --> 03:33:59,224
MATT: "Hi."

3497
03:33:59,481 --> 03:34:02,502
TRAVIS: Eat your vegetables, you'll look like
this.

3498
03:34:02,502 --> 03:34:06,275
MATT: "Okay."

3499
03:34:06,275 --> 03:34:07,233
TRAVIS: Now get out of here!

3500
03:34:07,233 --> 03:34:08,176
MATT: (yells)

3501
03:34:08,176 --> 03:34:09,402
(all laugh)

3502
03:34:09,402 --> 03:34:12,336
MATT: Just immediately bolts past to catch up with
the rest of the crowd.

3503
03:34:12,336 --> 03:34:16,324
TALIESIN: So I believe you just set up a lifetime
of unreasonable expectations.

3504
03:34:16,324 --> 03:34:17,915
TRAVIS: He'll be healthy, though.

3505
03:34:17,915 --> 03:34:19,756
LAURA: I've never seen Grog eat a single
vegetable--

3506
03:34:19,756 --> 03:34:20,751
TRAVIS: No, fuck those things.

3507
03:34:20,751 --> 03:34:22,608
LAURA: -- the entire time I've known him.

3508
03:34:22,608 --> 03:34:23,740
TALIESIN: I was wondering about that.

3509
03:34:23,740 --> 03:34:26,029
TRAVIS: Nothing in green is good.

3510
03:34:27,080 --> 03:34:32,372
MATT: A short time passes. A few moments, before
you begin to see the city suddenly come to more

3511
03:34:32,372 --> 03:34:37,176
vibrant life. People are stepping out of their
abodes. Dozens of individuals are beginning to

3512
03:34:37,176 --> 03:34:41,400
come together, talking, whispering, and some
looking back and watching you all in the outskirts

3513
03:34:41,400 --> 03:34:45,957
of Zephra, until eventually it seems a procession
of some kind is all gathering and moving out of

3514
03:34:45,957 --> 03:34:52,122
this mass of people in your direction. As you
look, you begin to see people adorned in similar

3515
03:34:52,122 --> 03:34:57,688
clothing as to when you first encountered Keyleth
in the swamps outside of Stillben. You see these

3516
03:34:57,688 --> 03:35:05,466
leather-based, almost scaled-looking armor that
drifts down to the legs. You see people that hold

3517
03:35:05,466 --> 03:35:15,726
giant staffs that hold golds and greens and blue
colors that mark the symbols of the Zephra tribe.

3518
03:35:15,726 --> 03:35:23,966
And then, in the center of them, you've met once
before, you see stepping forth, Korren, the father

3519
03:35:23,966 --> 03:35:31,638
of Keyleth and the current acting Voice of Tempest
of the Zephra. His long white, silver hair

3520
03:35:31,638 --> 03:35:37,782
drifting behind him. He approaches with a look.
Everyone holds back as he steps forth from the

3521
03:35:37,782 --> 03:35:43,773
crowd and ignoring the rest of you, just goes and
beelines straight to Keyleth. You can see him, he

3522
03:35:43,839 --> 03:35:50,368
has a bit of a limp to him that you don't recall
from last time, but he seems other than that in

3523
03:35:50,368 --> 03:35:56,156
good health. As he approaches you, he clasps his
hands out in front of him and takes a good long

3524
03:35:56,156 --> 03:36:01,535
look at you as he reaches out and takes your hands
into his own. "My daughter."

3525
03:36:01,575 --> 03:36:06,129
MARISHA: I just drop to a knee and say, Kaitiyaki,
father.

3526
03:36:06,129 --> 03:36:16,881
MATT: "Kaitiyaki, Keyleth. We've heard that the
defense of Emon was successful, yes?"

3527
03:36:17,389 --> 03:36:26,071
MARISHA: Yes, we have defeated the Chroma
Conclave. The help of Vox Machina and many many

3528
03:36:26,071 --> 03:36:28,883
others, at the cost of many lives.

3529
03:36:28,883 --> 03:36:33,354
MATT: "Good, good. I'm glad we could be of some
aid to your journey."

3530
03:36:33,426 --> 03:36:40,199
MARISHA: Yes, thank you. The Air Ashari were very
valuable during that day. Very courageous.

3531
03:36:40,203 --> 03:36:46,723
MATT: "And we will remember those we lost in that
fray. The great sacrifices that they gave so that

3532
03:36:46,723 --> 03:36:55,052
"these children could live. So?" And at this point,
he now takes notice of the rest of the group. "By

3533
03:36:55,214 --> 03:37:03,685
"what joy do we have of bringing your allies here
and returning to your people?"

3534
03:37:03,975 --> 03:37:06,052
LAURA: He doesn't know.

3535
03:37:06,052 --> 03:37:18,108
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought Uvenda might have said
something. I'm here because I have completed my

3536
03:37:18,108 --> 03:37:21,346
Aramente, and have come for my blessing.

3537
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:22,451
MATT: "Yes, you have."

3538
03:37:22,451 --> 03:37:24,542
LAURA: (gasps)

3539
03:37:25,162 --> 03:37:28,276
MATT: "I just wanted to hear it from your lips."

3540
03:37:30,143 --> 03:37:37,157
MARISHA: Still waiting on your final word, I
guess.

3541
03:37:37,383 --> 03:37:48,354
MATT: "Well, while we still have daylight, let us
prepare for the ceremony. Come, come, all of you.

3542
03:37:48,354 --> 03:37:59,216
"You are welcome, welcome here in Zephra. We'll
begin, decoration shall commence. Rest, prepare,

3543
03:37:59,439 --> 03:38:04,524
"naught but two or three hours until the ceremony
is to occur." He turns, and folks begin to rush

3544
03:38:04,524 --> 03:38:10,417
in, and people just begin to barrage you with
questions and congratulations, and a number of

3545
03:38:10,417 --> 03:38:14,605
individuals who seem to have heard stories, many
second-hand, and exaggerations of the various

3546
03:38:14,605 --> 03:38:21,517
things that you've accomplished over the past year
or so here in Tal'Dorei. You answer questions, you

3547
03:38:21,517 --> 03:38:26,695
play into the tall tales if you want. One child
turns to you and goes, "And who are you?"

3548
03:38:27,241 --> 03:38:28,662
SAM: Taryon Darrington.

3549
03:38:28,662 --> 03:38:29,945
MATT: "I don't know who you are."

3550
03:38:29,945 --> 03:38:30,669
SAM: You will.

3551
03:38:30,669 --> 03:38:31,415
MATT: "You--"

3552
03:38:31,415 --> 03:38:33,652
(all laugh)

3553
03:38:33,652 --> 03:38:42,044
MATT: There is a massive interest around Grog as
goliaths generally do not travel this far up into

3554
03:38:42,044 --> 03:38:46,385
the territory of the mountain. Most of them stay
far north in the Cliffkeep or wandering the

3555
03:38:46,385 --> 03:38:52,832
dividing plain. They're just swarming you and
climbing up on you and hanging from your arms and

3556
03:38:53,054 --> 03:38:57,324
you feel kind of awkward but kind of enjoying the
attention at the same time.

3557
03:38:57,324 --> 03:38:59,194
TRAVIS: They're really little.

3558
03:38:59,194 --> 03:39:00,915
LAURA: Kind of like gnomes.

3559
03:39:00,915 --> 03:39:02,170
TRAVIS: Yeah. (gasps)

3560
03:39:02,170 --> 03:39:04,069
(all laugh)

3561
03:39:04,069 --> 03:39:05,910
TALIESIN: Well that works, well done.

3562
03:39:05,910 --> 03:39:07,445
TRAVIS: I'm good.

3563
03:39:07,445 --> 03:39:15,726
MATT: Immediately, over the next hour or two,
people begin to gather floral wreaths and strips

3564
03:39:15,726 --> 03:39:20,988
of silk and material that have been prepared
specifically for these types of occasions. Many of

3565
03:39:21,145 --> 03:39:26,131
them new, made from the recent generations in
preparation, many that are held over by tradition

3566
03:39:26,182 --> 03:39:33,030
and by the various leaders that came before you.
Many that may have had the hope of the return of

3567
03:39:33,030 --> 03:39:38,463
Vilya, but instead, carry through with memory of
Keyleth. As this transpires, you guys are brought

3568
03:39:38,463 --> 03:39:47,024
food, you are gathered into a central open
celebration. Almost like a pit that descends about

3569
03:39:47,024 --> 03:39:52,214
two feet, and there are a number of stools and
tables, and food and drink are brought about. As

3570
03:39:52,214 --> 03:39:57,616
opposed to an event and then a celebration
afterward, it seems to be a reverse here at

3571
03:39:57,616 --> 03:40:03,971
Zephra. It's a build-up. It's everyone, the
excitement grows. As this is happening, you glance

3572
03:40:04,026 --> 03:40:10,669
off and there is one very large, singular tree
right across the way, at the very edge of the

3573
03:40:10,669 --> 03:40:16,848
precipice of this rocky outcropping that holds
most of the city of Zephra. And there at the edge

3574
03:40:16,848 --> 03:40:24,801
you see one large, twisting, gnarled tree that
curves upward. Not quite Sun Tree in height and

3575
03:40:24,801 --> 03:40:30,527
size, but still very elegant and beautiful with
long, thin branches that gently sway on the

3576
03:40:30,527 --> 03:40:35,748
outskirts of whatever barrier seems to bend and
twist the winds from coming and scattering the

3577
03:40:35,748 --> 03:40:42,504
village. You watch as people step up to it, and
they're leaving jewelry, they're putting large

3578
03:40:42,504 --> 03:40:47,229
ribbons across it. Elements of it remind you of
the tree that was in the center of the temple in

3579
03:40:47,229 --> 03:40:55,956
Vesrah, though a different texture. It seems to be
a deep, vibrant, healthy dark brown, and with

3580
03:40:55,956 --> 03:41:03,558
elements of gray bark, with moss that grow at the
base and tuck under the branches, where the

3581
03:41:03,558 --> 03:41:11,086
shadows tend to linger throughout the day.
Eventually, it seems that they have returned and

3582
03:41:11,086 --> 03:41:19,848
the decor is set, benches have been moved, and
most of the people of Zephra are now shifting in

3583
03:41:19,848 --> 03:41:21,744
the direction of this tree.

3584
03:41:21,744 --> 03:41:26,406
LIAM: In all the hubbub and the movement, a few
moments before, I've been watching for Korren, and

3585
03:41:26,406 --> 03:41:30,492
when I see him alone for a second, I make a
beeline toward him.

3586
03:41:30,492 --> 03:41:34,633
MATT: He's in the process of a conversation. And
it's interesting. During this whole thing, he was

3587
03:41:34,633 --> 03:41:40,171
excited to see you and that you've come, but he's
also-- he's kept a strange distance from you

3588
03:41:40,171 --> 03:41:49,454
during this preparation. He smiles, and you guys
meet eyes occasionally, but he's also just

3589
03:41:49,454 --> 03:41:55,977
focusing on this endeavor, and then you kind of
come out of the blue. "Ah, yes, Vax'ildan."

3590
03:41:56,028 --> 03:42:00,119
LIAM: Forgive me. Might I have just a moment?

3591
03:42:00,119 --> 03:42:03,369
MATT: "Quickly. We're about to begin, but yes."

3592
03:42:03,369 --> 03:42:12,132
LIAM: I will be brief. I just wanted to take a
moment to say, I really wish you could've seen

3593
03:42:12,132 --> 03:42:26,896
some of the things she has done. I know you are
proud of her. I've never met anyone like her.

3594
03:42:26,896 --> 03:42:36,313
She's going to do your people very proud. I'm
grateful.

3595
03:42:36,366 --> 03:42:38,845
MATT: "As are we all."

3596
03:42:41,302 --> 03:42:43,324
LIAM: You've a lot to do.

3597
03:42:43,683 --> 03:42:51,074
MATT: "As do you. As does she." And he reaches out
and pats you on the head and ruffles your hair a

3598
03:42:51,074 --> 03:42:57,476
little bit. And even that feels a little awkward
for him, like he felt impulsive to do it, and then

3599
03:42:57,476 --> 03:43:01,923
'oh, that wasn't very-- mm.'

3600
03:43:01,923 --> 03:43:05,385
LIAM: It's all right. It's more than I ever got.

3601
03:43:06,107 --> 03:43:10,578
TALIESIN: Whoa. Ow.

3602
03:43:10,578 --> 03:43:12,240
SAM: Darkness.

3603
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:21,798
MATT: "Anyway. Come. It's nearly time." And as all
of you are led over, there are spaces at the very

3604
03:43:21,805 --> 03:43:27,431
front of the ceremony, in the semicircle around
this tree. There are platforms set up at the base

3605
03:43:27,431 --> 03:43:37,901
of this tree now. Amongst these hundreds of
various, dangling threads, these small pieces of

3606
03:43:37,901 --> 03:43:42,698
paper that flitter on the outskirts of the gentle
wind that pushes through. You guess they might

3607
03:43:42,698 --> 03:43:48,275
contain wishes or passages or something, but you
see bits of script written on them amongst the

3608
03:43:48,325 --> 03:43:55,369
various glinting pieces of glass and gems and
stone that have been polished. It's small, but beautiful.

3609
03:44:00,065 --> 03:44:07,789
Eventually, you're led to sit in the center of this
semi-circle, and as everyone gathers and takes

3610
03:44:07,962 --> 03:44:12,125
their seat, you hear the occasional kid crying
and people muttering to themself, and eventually

3611
03:44:12,125 --> 03:44:20,974
everyone shushes as Korren, now wearing a very old
ceremonial long light blue and white robe

3612
03:44:20,974 --> 03:44:31,524
wearing what looks to be some sort of a somewhat
tattered, like a scarf that's wrapped around his

3613
03:44:31,524 --> 03:44:35,349
neck and drapes off each of his arms. It's thick and
it's long and it almost touches the ground around

3614
03:44:35,349 --> 03:44:42,763
him, but you can tell from the way he holds it, and 
his arms consistently rest at this crooked position

3615
03:44:42,763 --> 03:44:52,162
that it has some symbolism to this ceremony. As
he steps up under the tree and turns around

3616
03:44:52,162 --> 03:44:58,734
everyone gets very quiet, and the wind seems
to almost stop on the outside of this barrier.

3617
03:44:58,786 --> 03:45:07,624
The rushing, perpetual gust of air
seems to almost hold its breath for this. He

3618
03:45:07,624 --> 03:45:18,008
clears his throat. And as he looks up to everyone,
you swear this tree begins to slowly produce

3619
03:45:18,008 --> 03:45:30,283
cherry blossoms as his words continue. "For long,
we of the winds have awaited the procession of our

3620
03:45:30,283 --> 03:45:39,737
"tradition. With the passing of our elder voice,
Dwala, it was my wife Vilya who was selected to

3621
03:45:39,737 --> 03:45:48,797
"take the Aramente. Beautiful and full of
determination, she accepted her path. And while

3622
03:45:48,797 --> 03:45:57,968
"she did not return to us, the destiny she set is
now seen as one of preparation. Her journey was

3623
03:45:57,968 --> 03:46:09,113
"not in vain, for it was her love that produced our
daughter. It was her guidance in joy that taught

3624
03:46:09,113 --> 03:46:19,320
"our child compassion. It was her discipline and
understanding that forged young Keyleth's spark of

3625
03:46:19,320 --> 03:46:31,563
"intuition and unlocked her adept connection with
nature and the winds. We mourn the loss of our

3626
03:46:31,563 --> 03:46:42,223
"Vilya, but take pride that she lives on in the
eyes of our own, returned, beloved woman of the

3627
03:46:42,223 --> 03:46:51,596
"winds. Here we bring together our collective
voices to bless upon my daughter, the memory of

3628
03:46:51,596 --> 03:47:02,285
"Vilya, the champion of Guasar, the mantle of our
destiny." And as he puts his arms up, from around

3629
03:47:02,285 --> 03:47:08,483
you to each side, Keyleth, you watch as young
acolytes begin to approach from each side, arms

3630
03:47:08,483 --> 03:47:17,464
down. All seemingly carrying these various pieces
of dark green, leather-like material. And as they

3631
03:47:17,464 --> 03:47:27,744
come together, they latch them into place and
slowly build this mantle. "Ring clear our voices

3632
03:47:27,911 --> 03:47:35,520
"to unite our breath and grant our strength to her
guidance and wisdom, as Keyleth takes the rightful

3633
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:44,010
"and earned responsibility of leading our people
into this next generation." At this point, the

3634
03:47:44,010 --> 03:47:51,849
assembled mantle is placed into Korren's arms. And
you now see this beautiful neck and shoulder piece

3635
03:47:51,849 --> 03:48:01,992
that rests past to the elbows, but limp and without
body, in his hands. As he holds it there and the

3636
03:48:02,053 --> 03:48:06,352
rest of the acolytes step back and find their
place, seated, he lifts his arms up a bit and

3637
03:48:06,352 --> 03:48:20,033
begins to just sing a singular note (sings). And
everyone around you in Zephra begins to join in in

3638
03:48:20,033 --> 03:48:24,352
this singular note. Do you choose to join in as
well?

3639
03:48:24,352 --> 03:48:25,035
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3640
03:48:25,035 --> 03:48:26,311
LAURA: Sure.

3641
03:48:26,311 --> 03:48:32,098
MATT: As you do, the notes begin to separate and
harmonize instinctually. It creates this symphony,

3642
03:48:32,098 --> 03:48:39,915
this beautiful tangling of hundreds of voices from
all across the spectrum. And what at first may

3643
03:48:39,915 --> 03:48:49,947
seem to resemble a discordant hymn, finds this
perfect spread of every note you've ever heard,

3644
03:48:49,947 --> 03:48:59,418
musically merging as one. As he does this,
instinctually, Keyleth, without even thinking, you

3645
03:48:59,418 --> 03:49:07,959
rise and begin to walk towards him. Like the
spirits of generations before you are lifting you

3646
03:49:07,959 --> 03:49:13,592
by your shoulders and elbows, and bring you up
before your father. You find the breath leave your

3647
03:49:13,592 --> 03:49:16,521
lungs, the inside of your mouth is dry.

3648
03:49:16,521 --> 03:49:17,615
MARISHA: Yeah.

3649
03:49:17,615 --> 03:49:21,874
MATT: You're unable to understand what it is
that's driving you, but before you know it you're

3650
03:49:21,874 --> 03:49:27,810
standing before your father, looking up into his
eyes as all of these voices just swirl around you,

3651
03:49:27,810 --> 03:49:33,733
this weird warmth. The nerves in your stomach
still climb to the top and vibrate within your

3652
03:49:33,733 --> 03:49:41,927
chest. As your father places this mantle over your
head and shoulders, and it comes to rest on you,

3653
03:49:41,927 --> 03:49:54,131
heavier than you expected, but it fits well. As he
places this, the green fades to a golden brown and

3654
03:49:54,131 --> 03:50:05,026
red and orange and yellow. And the green leaves
almost drip back into a long, springing trail of a

3655
03:50:05,026 --> 03:50:13,506
cloak behind you that seems to grow with each
passing surge of these voices around her, until it

3656
03:50:13,506 --> 03:50:24,150
reaches the ground and curls behind.
Eventually the cloak stops. The voices soften, and

3657
03:50:24,212 --> 03:50:33,441
come to silence, as you look up once more into
your father's face. "Rise, my daughter, and become

3658
03:50:33,441 --> 03:50:47,446
"Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest." He steps back and
bows his head. Steps off the platform. And you

3659
03:50:47,446 --> 03:50:55,844
stand and turn, and it's just you at the base of
tree, looking about at all of Zephra before you,

3660
03:50:55,844 --> 03:51:01,439
quiet, silent. And your friends before you, at the
front of the crowd.

3661
03:51:12,119 --> 03:51:25,059
MARISHA: Didn't think I'd make it here. I couldn't
have done any of this without not only the support

3662
03:51:25,059 --> 03:51:46,690
of every person in Zephra, and every person of the
Ashari tribe, members of Emon, Tal'Dorei, Marquet,

3663
03:51:46,690 --> 03:52:06,740
even Wildmount. In my journeys, I've learned being
a leader is a global effort, one that takes the

3664
03:52:06,740 --> 03:52:20,818
wisdom of many. Most importantly, I couldn't have
done any of this without Vox Machina. And the

3665
03:52:20,818 --> 03:52:29,972
pieces of them that I've taken away and have
desperately tried to emulate in each one of them

3666
03:52:29,972 --> 03:52:43,519
over the years. Each one of them with qualities
that I admire and strive to embrace. Grog, with

3667
03:52:43,519 --> 03:53:02,930
his strength and his unyielding loyalty. Vex, with
her self-confidence and utter fearlessness. Vax is

3668
03:53:02,930 --> 03:53:13,389
one of the most compassionate people I think I've
ever come across and one of the most brave, even

3669
03:53:13,389 --> 03:53:31,060
if it's maybe foolish. Percival, with your
intelligence and your sensibility, is always there

3670
03:53:31,060 --> 03:53:46,126
to be my balance. Scanlan, with his charisma and
his wit. Pike--

3671
03:53:46,126 --> 03:53:50,999
MATT: As you glance past the group, you can see
just the faint flutter of golden light and energy.

3672
03:53:50,999 --> 03:53:53,975
Wherever she is, a part of her is watching.

3673
03:53:53,975 --> 03:54:08,064
MARISHA: Pike, her generosity and her
authenticity, always true to herself. And even

3674
03:54:08,064 --> 03:54:21,406
Tary. Taryon Darrington, whose blind faith in Vox
Machina and perseverance, trusted us even though

3675
03:54:21,406 --> 03:54:25,045
he probably shouldn't have.

3676
03:54:26,915 --> 03:54:29,488
SAM: (whispers) You're incredible.

3677
03:54:35,343 --> 03:54:44,992
MARISHA: All of these things that I learned and
couldn't be a leader without. Vox Machina makes up

3678
03:54:45,053 --> 03:55:15,098
me. Zephra makes up me. The Ashari people, and all
of greater Exandria. I don't know if I'm the

3679
03:55:15,098 --> 03:55:28,000
leader that you deserve, or a good leader, but I'm
willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing

3680
03:55:28,000 --> 03:55:37,717
whatever I can for all of us. As long as Vox
Machina stands by my side.

3681
03:55:43,099 --> 03:55:50,565
MATT: At this point, you watch as the light that
remains of the eventually soon-to-come setting sun

3682
03:55:50,565 --> 03:55:56,277
glints across the cheek of Keyleth, the bit of
damp tear that has rolled down her cheek just

3683
03:55:56,277 --> 03:56:03,198
detaches from the edge of her chin and hits the
bottom of the stone. Every cherry blossom in the

3684
03:56:03,198 --> 03:56:11,250
tree releases, and drifts past her from behind,
before getting caught up in the wind just past

3685
03:56:11,250 --> 03:56:21,826
her, causing this swirl of pinks and reds and
whites behind her. Everyone around rises up, and

3686
03:56:21,826 --> 03:56:29,202
they all begin to cheer and clap. All together.
You look around and watch the rest of these

3687
03:56:29,202 --> 03:56:37,374
blossoms slowly drift. You look and see your
friends around you. You look around and you see

3688
03:56:37,374 --> 03:56:43,693
your mother, out of the corner of your eye, just
the memory of her. You sense that if she could be

3689
03:56:43,693 --> 03:56:54,798
here, she would've been. Your father steps up and
takes your hands and just says, "I'm so proud of

3690
03:56:54,798 --> 03:57:06,179
"you. And there's much to be done, I know, but I'm
proud of you." And he takes your hand, and holds

3691
03:57:06,179 --> 03:57:15,504
it up once more. "To the Voice of the Tempest. And
the future of our people." Everyone cheers once

3692
03:57:15,504 --> 03:57:16,546
more together.

3693
03:57:16,546 --> 03:57:17,930
SAM: To Vox Tempesta!

3694
03:57:17,930 --> 03:57:21,516
(all laugh)

3695
03:57:21,809 --> 03:57:25,014
MATT: And with that, you gain the Inspiring Leader
feat.

3696
03:57:25,014 --> 03:57:26,520
MARISHA: What? I get the what now?

3697
03:57:26,520 --> 03:57:30,701
MATT: Inspiring Leader feat, as the end of your
Aramente.

3698
03:57:30,701 --> 03:57:34,185
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, Voice of the Tempest!

3699
03:57:36,223 --> 03:57:41,881
MATT: Which is pretty fun. What that allows you to
do is--

3700
03:57:41,881 --> 03:57:43,820
TRAVIS: You can never die.

3701
03:57:43,820 --> 03:57:52,058
MATT: No, you can totally die. You can spend ten
minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up

3702
03:57:52,058 --> 03:57:57,156
their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up
to six friendly creatures, which can include

3703
03:57:57,156 --> 03:58:01,028
yourself, within 30 feet that can hear and
understand you. Each creature can gain temporary

3704
03:58:01,028 --> 03:58:04,051
hit points equal to your level plus your charisma
modifier.

3705
03:58:04,244 --> 03:58:07,991
MARISHA: Oh, what! Well, you guys are out of luck
with the charisma modifier shit, but what!

3706
03:58:07,991 --> 03:58:09,842
(all laugh)

3707
03:58:09,842 --> 03:58:13,267
MATT: And they can only gain the temporary hit
points from this until they finish a short or long

3708
03:58:13,267 --> 03:58:17,370
rest. So every short rest you can give everyone 17
temporary hit points.

3709
03:58:17,370 --> 03:58:22,061
MARISHA: That is fucking dope!

3710
03:58:22,127 --> 03:58:23,865
SAM: You have to give a speech every time.

3711
03:58:24,324 --> 03:58:27,388
MATT: Essentially, you take ten minutes to talk
everybody up. So start practicing.

3712
03:58:27,388 --> 03:58:28,988
MARISHA: Jeez, no.

3713
03:58:32,674 --> 03:58:34,248
MATT: And we'll leave it there for the evening.

3714
03:58:34,307 --> 03:58:36,108
LAURA: Oh, man.

3715
03:58:36,108 --> 03:58:38,645
TRAVIS: That was gorgeous, man. That was
gorgeous.

3716
03:58:38,645 --> 03:58:40,264
LAURA: With the tree, man.

3717
03:58:40,264 --> 03:58:46,315
MATT: That was awesome. Completed your Aramente,
took up the mantle, and, apparently, going to the

3718
03:58:46,315 --> 03:58:49,648
Iron City of Dis soon. That's going to be fun.

3719
03:58:50,318 --> 03:58:51,933
TRAVIS: (sings) We built this-- No, no more.

3720
03:58:51,933 --> 03:58:54,034
LAURA: No more of Dis City.

3721
03:58:54,912 --> 03:58:58,898
TALIESIN: I came up with great formal wear for
you, too. It's a shame we didn't get a chance. I

3722
03:58:58,898 --> 03:59:02,128
figured you out.

3723
03:59:02,128 --> 03:59:03,092
TRAVIS: We'll see.

3724
03:59:03,092 --> 03:59:03,850
TALIESIN: All right.

3725
03:59:03,850 --> 03:59:05,042
TRAVIS: Grog has a very discerning taste.

3726
03:59:05,042 --> 03:59:06,742
TALIESIN: I'm very proud I came up with an idea.

3727
03:59:06,742 --> 03:59:09,785
LAURA: Well, I'm glad we went with the blue dress
after that cape turned all the other colors of

3728
03:59:09,785 --> 03:59:11,908
nature and it's like, you are covered.

3729
03:59:11,908 --> 03:59:13,558
MARISHA: Yes.

3730
03:59:13,558 --> 03:59:16,988
(all laugh)

3731
03:59:16,988 --> 03:59:22,109
TRAVIS: Covered, girl.

3732
03:59:22,109 --> 03:59:26,185
MATT: Well done, guys. Thank you again, Loot Crate,
for being our awesome sponsor.

3733
03:59:26,237 --> 03:59:27,723
ALL: Loot Crate!

3734
03:59:27,723 --> 03:59:29,689
TRAVIS: Matt, you did a great job.

3735
03:59:29,689 --> 03:59:33,721
MATT: You guys are always such an absolute
pleasure. Thank you for playing in my weird

3736
03:59:33,721 --> 03:59:35,880
make-up world.

3737
03:59:37,581 --> 03:59:40,873
TALIESIN: How long have you been working on that
speech, man? That was nuts.

3738
03:59:40,873 --> 03:59:42,993
MATT: Oh, that was fun. I've been waiting for
everybody to get to that moment.

3739
03:59:42,993 --> 03:59:46,386
SAM: Improv-ed it.

3740
03:59:46,505 --> 03:59:48,083
MATT: Glad you survived to get there.

3741
03:59:48,083 --> 03:59:50,505
MARISHA: No shit.

3742
03:59:51,077 --> 03:59:54,737
LIAM: Died in Stillben, game three.

3743
03:59:55,829 --> 03:59:58,481
MARISHA: And send out the next one.

3744
03:59:58,535 --> 04:00:03,534
MATT: All right. We'll be back next week, to see
where the next leg of Vox Machina's adventure

3745
04:00:03,534 --> 04:00:09,184
takes them. Until then, have a wonderful night,
have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet?

3746
04:00:09,184 --> 04:00:11,343
Take care guys.

3747
04:00:11,343 --> 04:00:13,240
(all cheer)
