1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,625
MATT: Hello, and good evening, everyone! Welcome
to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:10,945
voice actors play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! Or yell
curse words at me as we intro. So yes! Welcome to

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:17,666
the show tonight! Sam Riegel is on his way, our
Scanlan will be here shortly. Such is the nature

4
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:23,827
of these things. But, anyway, welcome to our show,
friends new and old. Tonight, we're continuing a

5
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:28,576
rather intense beginning of the next arc of
Critical Role, as Laura prepares her dice via

6
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:34,714
bulk-rolling. I like the juju aspect of it. It's
nice. It gets the energy going. Just burn all

7
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:36,315
those twenties out first.

8
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,761
LAURA: Oh, I've already rolled two.

9
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,014
MATT: See? There you go.

10
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,215
LIAM: Those are two you cannot use.

11
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:41,448
LAURA: I know!

12
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:47,017
MATT: So, yeah! So, tonight we have a special
guest that will be coming into the show a little

13
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:52,174
later on, as part of the story arc, and after
tonight, we will be having Critmas for this month.

14
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:56,084
It won't be all of us, some folks have a really
early morning tomorrow and unfortunately have to

15
00:00:56,084 --> 00:01:03,015
run off due to needing to exist tomorrow
professionally, but we will be doing that this

16
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,792
evening. Let's see, as far as announcements go--

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,011
MARISHA: We're winging it today. Sorry.

18
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:13,361
MATT: Yeah. It's all good. So, I guess first and
foremost, reminder for those of us who are

19
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:19,815
interested in going to Portland for Wizard World
Portland in a few weeks, we'll be there for that.

20
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:21,648
I know, except for Liam.

21
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:25,026
TRAVIS: February 19th to the 21st. Come say hi!
Yeah.

22
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:27,590
MARISHA: It's so hard to get all of us in one
place at the same time.

23
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,441
TRAVIS: If you're even in a neighboring state,
come see us, because we might not make it all that

24
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:33,516
way again.

25
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,797
LAURA: And bring your dice, and we'll all roll
together!

26
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,510
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll bless them. Or he will.

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,036
TALIESIN: I'll bless them, Laura will curse them,
it'll be great!

28
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:49,243
MATT: Also, me and Marisha will be at Colorado
Anime Fest, the weekend before that-- actually

29
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,324
next weekend.

30
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:51,665
MARISHA: Valentine's-- next weekend!

31
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:53,061
MATT: Next weekend! We'll be in Denver for that
convention.

32
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,570
MARISHA: Come spend Valentine's Day with us.

33
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,440
TALIESIN: And I will be at Amazing Arizona Comic
Con that weekend. The Amazing Arizona Comic Con,

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,852
Saturday and Sunday.

35
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:03,634
LIAM: Sam's here-- can someone let Sam in?

36
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:04,755
LAURA: We have a gnome!

37
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:05,835
MATT: Let Sam in!

38
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,138
TRAVIS: (yelling) I got him!

39
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:18,667
MATT: Travis has this. I like this very much.
Let's see, other announcements. Oh, the next

40
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:23,616
episode of the GM/DM Tips goes up tomorrow on the
Geek &amp; Sundry website. Check that out. Not sure

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,690
what topic it is. I don't know what order they're
putting them out on, so it'll be a surprise for

42
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,315
both of us! But hopefully you guys will find it
helpful. I hope the previous ones have as well. If

43
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:35,060
these turn out well, and people like them, and go
click on them and share them around, they'll be

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,201
more apt to do more, in which case I can do more
in-depth, advanced videos. So, let's hope that

45
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,687
works out well.

46
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:47,817
MARISHA: Even if you're not a DM, you should go
look at them. So you can keep making more!

47
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:49,184
MATT: Exactly. Yes!

48
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,271
MARISHA: Be a kind clicker.

49
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,427
(Last of Us clicker noises)

50
00:02:54,427 --> 00:03:00,047
MATT: Yeah, that's a whole different clicker. And
then, first weekend of March, me and Marisha will

51
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:05,602
be in Cork, in Ireland, for Kaizoku Con. So,
that'll be a lot of fun, you guys can come out

52
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:10,089
there. And yes, I know that Ireland is not in the
UK, that was meant to be a joke, but the internet

53
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:14,172
did not take it as such, and felt the need to
correct me for a week. And you know what, I

54
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,174
deserve that--

55
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:16,472
LIAM: There are no jokes here!

56
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,485
TALIESIN: That's crazy, the internet has the best
sense of humor about everything!

57
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,810
MARISHA: The internet always understands sarcasm!

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,884
MATT: But as a person of some Irish lineage, I may
have accidentally also offended my ancestors, so I

59
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,529
apologize to everyone!

60
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,597
ALL: Hey!

61
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:32,519
MATT: We have a gnome!

62
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,222
MARISHA: Hey scarf man!

63
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:37,184
SAM: I got to go get ice!

64
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,555
MATT: Go get ice? He'll be back!

65
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:42,079
LIAM: Is he cosplaying as Matthew Mercer? What's
going on?

66
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,521
MARISHA: Thanks to the Critter who sent us bacon
jerky.

67
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,127
LAURA: Travis will be smelling like bacon jerky
for the rest of his life.

68
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:56,807
TRAVIS: Prepare yourself! That smells extra like
dog farts!

69
00:03:56,807 --> 00:04:01,172
LAURA: Oh! It really does!

70
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,377
TRAVIS: Just have a piece! One little piece!

71
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,653
LAURA: I'm sure it's delicious!

72
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,101
TRAVIS: I'll give you the ear.

73
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,802
TALIESIN: Thank you!

74
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,880
MATT: Aww, that's-- whoever sent those, thank
you.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,047
MARISHA: That was amazing!

76
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,703
TALIESIN: That's very aerodynamic jerky.

77
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:18,202
MATT: Let's see, other announcements. Liam, do you
want to mention that one thing?

78
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:23,801
LIAM: Yeah, we'll do our weekly shout-out to
Wyrmwood gaming. If you go over to Wyrmwood Gaming

79
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:29,093
and put in the code "CRITROLE", you'll get free
shipping, and also, over at Wyrmwood Gaming,

80
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:36,596
they're doing a Valentine's Day Lottery, where
you're getting a mystery box for a lower rate? I

81
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:40,411
dunno, look at the rules, I don't want to mess it
up. But your dork dollars will go farther if you

82
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:43,394
go over there this week. Happy Valentine's Day!

83
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:46,485
TRAVIS: Dork dollars, that's like bitcoin, right?

84
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:53,001
MATT: Yeah, kind of! Let's see, other things-- for
those who didn't see it, Lootcrate put up a

85
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:59,492
cool video about their most recent package that's
going out this month, themed "Dead," in which they

86
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:03,444
shot a ten-minute short film in the zombie
apocalypse, starring me!

87
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:04,431
LAURA: I saw!

88
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:09,119
MATT: Did you see it? It was fun. I got really
dirty. And Marisha has a cameo in it as my

89
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,846
deceased girlfriend.

90
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,606
Sorry.

91
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,974
LIAM: So sad.

92
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:15,898
TRAVIS: You didn't save her?

93
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,108
MATT: Look! You think I can save anyone in the
apocalypse?

94
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,471
TRAVIS: I would hope so.

95
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:25,640
MARISHA: Honestly, it's impressive that you were
the one that lived.

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,224
TRAVIS: Would you straight-up run, or would you
throw people in front of you so that they would be

97
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,064
trampled?

98
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:32,015
MATT: Neither! I'd try and work things out, and
then get sniped in the head. We've had this

99
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:32,986
conversation.

100
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,660
MARISHA: Yeah, are you kidding me? He'd be the
first one that would be like, "Oh, rivalling--"

101
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,912
LAURA: "Let's save everyone!"

102
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:39,169
SAM: Phone's ringing, sorry.

103
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,712
MATT: Oh. You need to get that.

104
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:43,096
SAM: You know what, I'll send it to voicemail.

105
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:47,061
MATT: Oh, thank you, Sam! So conscientious.
(laughs)

106
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:52,610
All righty, anything else anyone needs to
mention? Or announce?

107
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,226
TRAVIS: Bacon jerky's fucking good!

108
00:05:55,226 --> 00:06:04,008
LAURA: It actually is really good. Yeah, once
you've tasted it, you don't smell the stank.

109
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,744
TALIESIN: It's like garlic. As long as everybody's
had the garlic, everything's cool.

110
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:08,511
LAURA: You wanna try it?

111
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:09,834
LIAM: No, I can smell it on you now!

112
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,013
LAURA: Right? It's disgusting!

113
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,177
TRAVIS: You want some? You want to join the fold?

114
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,263
LIAM: No!

115
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:19,326
MARISHA: It is adding to, like, the tavern-ish
feel of this place.

116
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:23,602
MATT: All righty! Announcements are over-- let's
go ahead and get into the game proper.

117
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:26,611
LAURA: Oh no!

118
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:32,406
MATT: So, to get us up to speed. Vox Machina, the
intrepid band of adventurers, who have been

119
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:39,185
enjoying being honorary members of the council of
Tal'Dorei, returning from a harsh adventure in

120
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:47,408
Whitestone, having the Winter's Crest festival,
and then going in and re-inspecting the death

121
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:53,737
place of a blue dragon they once fought over a
year ago, returned just in time for a series of

122
00:06:53,737 --> 00:07:02,515
chromatic dragons, white, black, red, and green,
all attacking Emon at once. This union of

123
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:09,428
extremely powerful dragons tore through the city,
with the red staying behind, named Thordak, the

124
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:16,691
Cinder King, basically housing himself in Emon and
claiming himself essentially ruler of that area.

125
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:24,723
The party fled to their keep, attempted to help a
bunch of refugees inside and then were immediately

126
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:29,696
attacked by Vorugal, the white dragon. A heavy
battle commenced that was ill in favor of your

127
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:35,764
victory until Thordak himself knocked Vorugal out
of the sky, claiming that there were better things

128
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:43,435
to be done. So three of the four of this Chroma
Conclave have now gone east, while Thordak sits in

129
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:50,429
the middle of his new nesting place. You guys
decided to try and help those who were in the keep

130
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:57,166
at the time, those who survived that encounter on
the outside of Greyskull. However, Percy and Grog

131
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,732
had a conversation about this magical skull
artifact they had acquired: this whispering in

132
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:10,190
exchange for a wish if it got freed. This led to a
rather intense bit of conflict--

133
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,384
TRAVIS: Negotiation?

134
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:19,335
MATT: Yes. (laughs) Which, thanks to the luck of
the die, seemed to avoid a unique circumstance,

135
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,822
whatever that might have been.

136
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,718
TRAVIS: Bullshit.

137
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:30,111
MATT: (laughs) However, the party in this tense
scenario were then visited by a dwarven

138
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:39,823
elementalist named Drake, along with your old-time
friend and guide Allura Vysoren, who had sensed

139
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:46,255
the connection to her teleportation circles here
in Emon severed immediately. There was discussion

140
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:51,577
about how this came about, who's to blame, and it
appears that this dragon has a history, 15 years

141
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:56,633
before, of having conflict with Allura and her
then-party of adventurers, many of whom lost their

142
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:01,471
life in the final battle. When they realized they
were unable to actually defeat Thordak, hatched a

143
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:05,666
plan to seal him within the elemental plane of
fire, and had managed to keep him there for 15

144
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:14,166
years until recently. We left off with Allura
suddenly sensing her connection to the Westruun

145
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,069
sigil severed as well.

146
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:18,916
LAURA: God, I forgot about that!

147
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,385
TRAVIS: Nothing like genocide to put you in the
mood!

148
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:31,378
MATT: Yeah! That is where we'll pick up. So, at
this point, after Allura senses this, her eyes go

149
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:36,248
wide for a moment and she-- you, being there in
front of her still, Keyleth, after your guys'

150
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:43,105
scrying ritual, grabs your shoulder, and looks
around the room. "Who is left? Where is the

151
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:48,243
"council? Which allies can we draw to us, in hopes
of planning our next move?"

152
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:51,179
MARISHA: We don't know.

153
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:52,737
TRAVIS: We are scattered.

154
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:54,600
LAURA: For all we know, the council is lost.

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,076
MARISHA: We could be all that's left.

156
00:09:56,076 --> 00:10:05,997
MATT: (sighs) "Well, we have to try and gather
what information we can about who remains. If

157
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:10,454
"anyone out there survives, any of our allies, we
need to make sure that they're brought away from

158
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:19,753
"the center of this chaos. And hopefully we can
reconvene and figure out a path of hoping to free

159
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:24,678
"our city, our entire land, of this scourge."

160
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:30,415
LAURA: How do we even make contact with them?
Thordak is in the center of town.

161
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:37,793
MATT: "Perhaps skirting the center and hoping
others have found their way towards the outskirts

162
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:45,107
"of it. I don't know. This is as far as I've gotten
to the city, is your guys' keep. You have the

163
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:50,848
"better position on this. Where would anyone in the
town go? Are there places to hide, are there--"

164
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:57,870
LIAM: I think that they would leave the center of
the city, at least to the edges, if not try to get

165
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,264
out, though that might be foolish.

166
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:03,859
TALIESIN: Check the harbor, maybe?

167
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:08,730
LAURA: We know that Riskel made secret passageways
in different places.

168
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,474
TRAVIS: Security tunnels!

169
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:17,514
LAURA: Yeah. Did we ever find out if he put one in
ours? Did we have one? That leads into the town?

170
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,021
TALIESIN: We don't know.

171
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:23,070
SAM: Oh, didn't we have a tunnel made that goes
under the wall?

172
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,423
MATT: You did, actually.

173
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,408
MARISHA: But does it lead out into the city?

174
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:30,415
MATT: You haven't actually utilized it yet.

175
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:34,914
LIAM: We've never used it, but they described it
to us when they brought us here the first day.

176
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,803
LAURA: Maybe we can sneak in!

177
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:38,039
SAM: To the city.

178
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,055
LAURA: Well, yeah!

179
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:41,206
LIAM: We need to see if Uriel is still alive.

180
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:42,485
SAM: By the way, hi guys.

181
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,581
LAURA: Hi, how's it going?

182
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:46,637
TRAVIS: Wait, who was with Gilmore?

183
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,895
LAURA: Gilmore disappeared. I didn't see where he
went.

184
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,881
LIAM: He was alone before it all happened.

185
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,648
TALIESIN: Well, that's another place to check.

186
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,950
MARISHA: What, where? Gilmore's?

187
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,751
TALIESIN: I'm thinking of where I would go if I
didn't know what to do--

188
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,891
LIAM: That's smart.

189
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:04,248
LAURA: What places are left that have a
teleportation circle?

190
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:08,922
SAM: What about the thieves' guild tunnels? Would
anyone go there?

191
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:13,802
MARISHA: It depends on who knows! It's a way out
of the city once again.

192
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,369
LAURA: The smuggler's coves, all of them.

193
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:16,781
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea, either.

194
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,380
MARISHA: That was all through the--

195
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,294
SAM: That bar.

196
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:21,237
MARISHA: Through the bar, in the--

197
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:23,201
SAM: Place. With the thing.

198
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,922
LAURA: That one!

199
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:34,056
MATT: "The connections I had to this town were
within my tower, your keep, and the Lyceum, the

200
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:39,507
"Alabaster Lyceum. The Lyceum has also been
severed, and though I know not of what may remain

201
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:45,288
"there, that is also a place of great power, hence
why it was probably a very operative target for

202
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:46,628
"their attack."

203
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:47,676
MARISHA: Allura.

204
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:48,537
MATT: "Yes?"

205
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:54,143
MARISHA: How far does your arcane connection
reach? Can you feel when you lose connection to

206
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,401
other cities?

207
00:12:55,401 --> 00:13:03,739
MATT: "If I have a connection to the sigil, yes. I
don't have much beyond the boundaries of

208
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:12,086
"Tal'Dorei. Vasselheim does not allow sigils for
transportation, it's against their philosophy

209
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:22,784
"against embedded arcane intrusion. If Westruun is
under attack as well, I will make my way there in

210
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,127
"hopes of salvaging any lives that I can."

211
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,300
MARISHA: You're leaving?

212
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:36,425
LAURA: If Westruun is under attack, now, and we
know Thordak is here, does that mean--?

213
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,288
TRAVIS: His forces are divided.

214
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:43,488
MARISHA: This is a takeover. For some reason
Thordak doesn't want to leave this city. Why?

215
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:46,398
SAM: This is the seat of power, right?

216
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:50,304
LAURA: We could potentially attack one of his
subordinates, though. One of the other dragons in

217
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:52,200
Westruun, by themselves!

218
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,447
SAM: But then he could just come and kill us!

219
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,501
LAURA: Well, then we teleport right back out.

220
00:13:58,501 --> 00:13:59,626
SAM: Okay?

221
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:04,199
LAURA: Bad idea? Bad idea?

222
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,854
SAM: How fast is he?

223
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:13,154
MARISHA: Well, they just made it to Westruun,
several hundred miles away, in all of 40 minutes?

224
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:14,950
TALIESIN: There's a lot of assumptions here.

225
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,883
MATT: "They move rather fast, and to be honest, I
hate to inform you, but my single teleportation

226
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:25,297
"ability has been utilized for the day in getting
here."

227
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,255
LAURA: Oh.

228
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:28,119
MARISHA: I'm tapped out, too.

229
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,993
TRAVIS: Me too.

230
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:34,306
LIAM: Lady Allura, what do you know of Marquet?

231
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,647
MATT: "Marquet."

232
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:40,152
LIAM: You said that they successfully repulsed
him.

233
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:45,403
MATT: "400 years ago, yes, when he was younger. He
was a much smaller dragon then."

234
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,801
LIAM: Oh.

235
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,867
TRAVIS: 400 years ago?

236
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,613
LAURA: Yeah, he is ancient, Grog! He is ancient!

237
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:53,628
TRAVIS: Yeah, slightly.

238
00:14:53,628 --> 00:15:02,723
MATT: "The only thing I can think of: there are
two bastions of knowledge that hold inklings as to

239
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:07,472
"what could be the undoing of dragonkind, of
powerful entities. There were battles of many such

240
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:18,482
"powerful entities, long, long ago, back before the
Penance, before the historical wiping of

241
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:25,238
"civilization. Some of these books remain in
Vasselheim, being the only city to have survived

242
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:35,212
"those times. A few have found their way in the
Cobalt Reserve, the library of Westruun. If I

243
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:40,939
"could go and hope that this library still stands,
stay out of sight, help who I can along the way,

244
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:45,945
"and gather what bits of research I can and bring
them back here, perhaps we could reconvene as long

245
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,400
"as you go and find who you can of our allies that
survive within Emon."

246
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,252
LAURA: We can do that!

247
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,392
TRAVIS: Within Emon.

248
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:54,387
LAURA: Yes.

249
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,131
SAM: Going to let you go on your own?

250
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:58,394
LIAM: Well, she has Drake with her.

251
00:15:58,394 --> 00:16:04,241
MATT: Which Drake next to her says, "Damn right,
she does! And I don't mean any offence, but the

252
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:06,699
"two of us is about the same as you lot!"

253
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,145
TRAVIS: Say what?

254
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:14,797
MATT: "Trust me," and he gives you this dwarven
grin as both of his eyes spark for a second with

255
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:15,888
electricity.

256
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,445
TRAVIS: (quietly) Well, fuck.

257
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:23,866
MATT: She pushes him aside and goes, "It's all
right, Drake. For our mission, it's going to

258
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:34,190
"require more-- success is guided on being subtle.
Some of you excel at that, maybe not all. And

259
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,494
"speed. I believe we can handle this. You're better
suited in combing large bits of territory and

260
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,296
"seeking the allies that may survive."

261
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:43,833
LAURA: Will you be leaving in the morning, then?
Can you go tonight?

262
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,131
MATT: "I should leave now."

263
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,789
MARISHA: You're going to go on foot?

264
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,136
MATT: "We have other means of transportation."

265
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:56,115
MARISHA: Allura, if you're going to Westruun, and
what you say is true, that we have two potential

266
00:16:56,115 --> 00:17:03,435
options for finding out how to defeat these
dragons, should we be heading to Vasselheim? Maybe

267
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,865
that's best where we're needed right now.

268
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:13,916
MATT: "If Vasselheim still stands, I-- knowing its
history, that is one of the most fortified cities,

269
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:23,269
"the most fortified city in our civilization. It's
endured two great wars, and has been the starting

270
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:29,839
"point of each cycle. I doubt even with the might
that these dragons hold, they would have the gall,

271
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:37,363
"the foolish intent, to attack such a place.
Especially the center of an entity such as

think Vasselheim is going to definitely claim a

"key role in this attempt to save ourselves."

274
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:52,062
LAURA: Bahamut is a good guy?

275
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,570
MARISHA: Yeah, for the most-- yeah, yeah.

276
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,713
LAURA: Cool.

277
00:17:55,713 --> 00:18:01,841
MARISHA: It's the city that was closest to Pyrah.

278
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,891
MATT: "Yes."

279
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:15,612
MARISHA: My people, my tribe. We could pull double
duty, we could go and I can--

280
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,328
TRAVIS: Heh. Doody.

281
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,215
MARISHA: Grog! Now is not the time!

282
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:25,585
TALIESIN: What of Whitestone? Was there any
mention, any--?

283
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:32,261
MATT: "I have no connection to Whitestone. I did
not have time arriving there to install a sigil."

284
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:38,391
TALIESIN: Did you learn anything of the anomaly
beneath the castle that might be useful?

285
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:50,180
MATT: She shakes herself in her current mindset
and goes, "Well, me and Drake here, we spent the

286
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,668
"better part of two days studying the structure
underneath the city. It itself appears to be at

287
00:18:55,668 --> 00:19:02,308
"least 600 years old, predating Whitestone's
construction. Unfortunately, both of our magics

288
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:08,564
"are thwarted in the proximity of this structure
and any rituals that we attempted, or would have

289
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:16,095
"been able to attempt, to discern its nature, in
the classic means, would not be functional due to

290
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:23,458
"its anti-magical properties. However, we've taken
a few things of note, and we're taking our

291
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,744
"observations to reach for two research facilities
around the world, one of which I intended to be

292
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:30,982
"the Cobalt Reserve before this happened."

293
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:34,815
TALIESIN: Interesting, thank you.

294
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:39,507
LAURA: So there was no-- you didn't move it, you
didn't do anything with it, it's still just

295
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,577
sitting there.

296
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,897
MARISHA: It's a hazard zone right now?

297
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:46,174
MATT: "Essentially. We have locked it off and it's
under intense guard. We spent a little bit of

298
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:52,732
"time experimenting with its properties, and any
object of firm matter that was introduced to this

299
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:58,503
"object was then torn from our grasp, sundered
into many pieces, and then vanished."

300
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:00,970
MARISHA: Yeah.

301
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,577
LAURA: Maybe we can get Thordak near the little
orb!

302
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,586
SAM: Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

303
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:04,870
LAURA: I like it.

304
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,116
TALIESIN: That was definitely what I was
thinking.

305
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:07,431
SAM: How do we do that?

306
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,380
TALIESIN: Well, it's part of a plan.

307
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,999
TRAVIS: Hey, big dragon, there's a snack over
here. Take a bite!

308
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,382
SAM: We could leave a trail of gold that leads to
it, Goldilocks-style.

309
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:28,195
MARISHA: That thing was also several hundred feet
below ground. How are we going to get that dragon

310
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,238
down there?

311
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:31,112
LIAM: Does Thordak have any offspring?

312
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:32,275
MATT: "Not that I know of."

313
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,370
LAURA: Not anymore.

314
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,376
TALIESIN: The thought would be to actually remove
it from the chamber, maybe.

315
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:43,138
LAURA: That could be really, really terrible.

316
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:48,477
TRAVIS: Do dragons have families? Do they have,
like, wives and loved ones?

317
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:49,939
LAURA: They have children.

318
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:57,350
MATT "Chromatics especially, from what I
understand in my research, they do mate, but there

319
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,085
"is no family structure, there is no love between
brethren, other than the continued existence of

320
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:10,738
"that bloodline. If a child of a dragon is
slaughtered and one does find out, depending on if

321
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:17,950
"it's their only brethren, it could incite a sense
of vengeance, depending on the color. But I know

322
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:28,454
"of no immediate children to Thordak. I have no
knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked

323
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,984
"this day."

324
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,496
TRAVIS: We should ask him.

325
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:35,269
LAURA: (laughs) We need to do as much research as
we can.

326
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,491
MATT "I have not seen Thordak myself in 15 years,
and I know not the state of which he is in, or

327
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:46,336
"what power he has now gained. Whatever information
you can gather safely, right now, is going to

328
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:51,998
"guide us down the rest of this path in attempting
to take this terrible creature down."

329
00:21:51,998 --> 00:22:00,334
SAM: If we go back into the city to try to find
council members, and we succeed, what does that

330
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:05,660
get us? A bunch of people who also don't know how
to defeat the dragon.

331
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,300
LAURA: Right, but they're powerful people! They
could help us.

332
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,782
SAM: Politically?

333
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:12,546
TALIESIN: Both, actually.

334
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,242
LAURA: Experience and warrior-wise.

335
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:19,987
TRAVIS: What about a spy? Dragons want servitude,
right?

336
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:27,715
MATT: "They, especially the reds, see themselves
as superior to all beings, and will bend, and have

337
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:33,516
"in the past bent, small townships and
civilizations to their whims and worship, yes.

338
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:38,253
"Which is, based on what you're telling me, is part
of what Thordak is attempting with this city now."

339
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:44,278
TRAVIS: So, what if we send a shady piece of shit
to go bend the knee and walk on the inside?

340
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,130
SAM: Listen, Jarett is good, but I don't want to
sacrifice him like that!

341
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,787
LAURA: What about you, Scanlan? You're so good at
lying, and--

342
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,181
MARISHA: Being shady!

343
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,842
LAURA: And sucking up, and grovelling--

344
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:00,114
SAM: What about Trinket?

345
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,074
LAURA: Trinket can't talk!

346
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,269
SAM: Oh, that's right!

347
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:04,767
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

348
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:11,225
LIAM: And I do have this-- pulling the brooch
off-- this would mask your true nature, somewhat.

349
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,702
TRAVIS: It's true! (gasps)

350
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:17,641
SAM: (stuttering) I am not going to go--

351
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:20,419
TRAVIS: Ancient, giant, red, fuck-off dragon!

352
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:27,207
SAM: They have mind control powers! They have
influence! They have charisma! Beyond even mine!

353
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:32,794
TRAVIS: You'll be his bitch! You'll trim his
toenails, you'll get real buddy-buddy--

354
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,604
SAM: I'm the size of his toenails!

355
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:36,571
LAURA: Slave Leia outfit, with a chain around your
neck!

356
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:40,055
LIAM: No, he's the little guy next to Jabba!
(cackling laughter)

357
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:43,495
MARISHA: You might be surprised. You might like
it!

358
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,793
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean like what, dragons have to
eat right? Dragons eat?

359
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,379
LAURA: Dragons eat.

360
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:55,508
TRAVIS: Yeah! So you poison a cow, and then
you're like, Oh Lord Thioredoxin, here you go!

361
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:59,501
Poison cow, you're dead, hero of the city!

362
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:02,205
SAM: Something tells me I would end up his gimp.

363
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:07,012
TRAVIS: (stuttering) You Dimension Door! You're
super quick! It's a no brainer!

364
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,228
SAM: All right, that's the best plan ever.

365
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:12,759
LAURA: Let's just think about it, all right,
Scanlan?

366
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:18,142
LIAM: We need to find Uriel. We need to go in--
all these are the next step-- we need to see-- we

367
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:22,773
have sacrificed a lot to save Uriel before, we're
not just going to leave him in the city! We need to

368
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:27,587
find the tunnel under this keep, go in there, see
who's left, and get them out!

369
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:35,284
MARISHA: You know, speaking of spies, does anyone
else feel like this is fairly convenient timing?

370
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:46,780
Someone in that council had to have known this was
happening. Wouldn't you? All of the Cloudtop

371
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,831
District was in one place!

372
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,870
LIAM: That's not a bad point.

373
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,288
MARISHA: Someone knew! It was the perfect
opportunity to strike! They took out the entire

374
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:00,355
upper echelon of the city in one strike! They
waited for them all to be in one place.

375
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:05,195
LAURA: General Krieg was here for a while, before
we discovered him. He had friends.

376
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:07,235
TALIESIN: But he wouldn't have known this was
coming, though.

377
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,327
LAURA: No, but he was one of them.

378
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:15,944
LIAM: It's possible they might not have been working
in conjunction with each other. They could have been

379
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:18,616
on their own, all of them, or all together, I
don't know.

380
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:24,361
TALIESIN: It does open the door to some definite
possibilities.

381
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:30,745
MARISHA: The timing was perfect. That's all I'm
saying.

382
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:32,110
TALIESIN: The timing was perfect.

383
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,810
TRAVIS: You know the best way to flush out
something like that? If someone was a spy.

384
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,607
(laughter)

385
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:43,234
SAM: All right, I'll do it, I'll go and--

386
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:45,761
MARISHA: What if we go and find a shady
individual, like he was saying. What if we don't

387
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,681
send in Scanlan. What if we find someone?

388
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,285
SAM: That person will surely die.

389
00:25:49,285 --> 00:25:52,974
(laughter)

390
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,549
MARISHA: You're probably right.

391
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:58,373
TRAVIS: Will surely die. Which I'm all right
with.

392
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:03,132
TALIESIN: Let's go find this tunnel that we paid
for.

393
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:09,263
LAURA: We need to see-- get in the city and find
some people. Allura, you be safe--

394
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,584
MATT: "I will."

395
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:14,327
LAURA: -- and silent and swift, and you get back
here as quickly as possible.

396
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:19,071
TALIESIN: What time is it? When was the last time
we actually took a nap?

397
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:24,970
MATT: Oh, it's been quite a while, you guys have
been running since before the meeting in the

398
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,141
Cloudtop District.

399
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:27,439
MARISHA: Which happened at nighttime, remember.

400
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,658
MATT: It happened at dusk.

401
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:31,438
LAURA: It's already morning the next day?

402
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:34,513
MATT: No, no, it's evening now for you guys.

403
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:37,883
MARISHA: What time approximately? After midnight?

404
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:39,910
MATT: I'd say it's after midnight, 1AM.

405
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,378
LAURA: Ah, fudge.

406
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,989
TRAVIS: Hot fudge?

407
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:48,491
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little tulip and hand it
to Allura.

408
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:53,711
MATT: She takes it, nods, places it in one of
the--

409
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:57,059
MARISHA: In case we need to be in contact.

410
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:00,281
LIAM: Well, if we go now, we have the benefit of
darkness in the city.

411
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,202
SAM: Hang on, we're going to go now, without
resting?

412
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:06,719
LIAM: I'm not saying that, I'm weighing our
options. If we go now, we can go under the cover

413
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:09,036
of night, but we're going to be exhausted.

414
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:13,499
TALIESIN: And dragons don't care about night. They
can see perfectly fine.

415
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,386
MARISHA: Yes, we've learned that much.

416
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:18,896
LIAM: Well, let's lie down and take a nap.

417
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,045
LAURA: Take a nap.

418
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,290
MARISHA: What time-- Wait, hang on.

419
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,351
LAURA: Sleep as little as possible that will
actually get us rested.

420
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,237
MATT: A short rest or a long rest?

421
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,967
LAURA: Long rest.

422
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,493
MATT: Long rest is eight hours.

423
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:31,757
LAURA: Should we sleep and get up in the
morning and hit it?

424
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:37,698
TALIESIN: It'll at least give everybody time to go
to ground.

425
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:45,462
LAURA: That's true. I mean, can I sense Thordak
and figure out, I mean, is he just settling in

426
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:49,924
that one spot? Is there anything else around or is
it just him in the center, being a dick, and no

427
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:52,112
other movement of other things?

428
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:58,385
MATT: You took a while earlier to concentrate and
you focus on that point again. Thordak is this

429
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:03,972
giant oppressive force of dragon kin in the center
of the city, seemingly not moving.

430
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:08,025
LIAM: And last week, you said that Vex couldn't
sense the other three.

431
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,072
MATT: Correct.

432
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,680
LAURA: They went to hit the other cities,
obviously.

433
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:19,036
MARISHA: I still have one 5th-level spell left. I
can Commune with Nature and try and find out if a

434
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:24,741
few people are still left in the city before we go
to sleep.

435
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,045
LIAM: Might as well.

436
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:27,472
MARISHA: If we're not going out.

437
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,669
LAURA: What?

438
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:34,459
MARISHA: I can Commune with Nature and try to find
certain people.

439
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,866
LAURA: Should we? Yeah.

440
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:41,832
MARISHA: All right. I go out to Pike and the
Sarenrae temple.

441
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:51,117
MATT: Okay, so as you go the temple, you can see
the surviving 25 people that are all lumped in.

442
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:56,607
They're calmer right now, but you can see a lot of
them are still consoling each other and talking

443
00:28:56,607 --> 00:29:00,374
and as soon as you walk in they're like-- a couple
of them step up immediately like, "What's going

444
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:03,626
"on, is everything all right?" "I'm sorry. Mom, I'm
sorry" They start crying and, "Shh! It's okay,

445
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:09,170
"it's okay. Is everything all right? Are we safe
here? Is this okay?"

446
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,525
MARISHA: You will be all right. Everyone calm
down. We've had a rough day and it's been hard on

447
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:23,247
everyone but you should be safe here for the
evening. Hopefully. Everyone--

448
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:24,530
TRAVIS: Do better.

449
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,924
MARISHA: Look, I'm not-- I'm trying on this whole
leadership thing, okay?

450
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:30,230
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

451
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,892
MARISHA: Ugh.

452
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:40,720
TALIESIN: Ouch, I didn't know it went that low.
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,726
MARISHA: Eight.

454
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:49,374
MATT: Surprisingly, I rolled a one. First roll of
the night.

455
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,601
MARISHA: Any little bit of hope works.

456
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:58,915
MATT: Yeah, apparently. So the one man who stood
up, and the younger child to him, looks around and

457
00:29:58,915 --> 00:30:07,643
he tells her, "Shh! Go lay down. Very well, thank
you again. We're sorry for--" Everyone else in the

458
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:13,715
room nods in agreement and you see they're dirt-
and tear-stained and all just happy to not be on

459
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:15,320
fire right now or frozen.

460
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,758
TRAVIS: Are there any injuries in the room that we
haven't attended to?

461
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:22,181
MATT: There have been a few injuries. However,
Pike has already taken time with Keyleth to see to

462
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,898
them, when they first arrived.

463
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:25,692
LAURA: Hey Matt, I was helping, too, mother--

464
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:28,184
MATT: You were helping until you were pulled away
for the five minutes.

465
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,089
TRAVIS: Good job, Pike. And you too, Vex.

466
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,812
ASHLEY: Yeah, you know, got to help the group.

467
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:41,076
MATT: All right, so, as you guys are having this
conversation, Allura and Drake walk their way out

468
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:48,742
to the courtyard and she looks back at the rest of
you and goes, "Stay safe, and if anything happens,

469
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:55,204
"find a way to let me know. I will return as soon
as I can with what I can find. Possibly who I can find."

470
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,024
LAURA: Wait!

471
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,313
MARISHA: Secrets!

472
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:08,933
TRAVIS: Don't forget to visit Gilmore's Glorious
Goods.

473
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:14,424
SAM: That's not a real place, Travis, it doesn't
exist.

474
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:19,817
TRAVIS: Who's Travis? I can't just hop in 
and out of character.

475
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:22,187
SAM: Grog, who are you talking to?

476
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:23,934
TRAVIS: My sword.

477
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:29,171
MARISHA: Your sword. You're promoting Gilmore's to
your sword.

478
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,108
MATT: So go ahead and roll for me.

479
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:33,405
LAURA: Okay.

480
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:34,842
TRAVIS: What?

481
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:38,799
LAURA: Whoa! 24.

482
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:47,132
MATT: Okay. All right. So as you and Allura
embrace, she steps back and gives a nod and looks

483
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,684
out to everybody.

484
00:31:48,684 --> 00:31:57,875
MARISHA: I reach out and I grab her hand and say,
thank you, truly, for everything.

485
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:05,292
MATT: "Don't thank me yet. Most of all of this
lies on my shoulders." And you can see she's

486
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:17,382
holding it together the best she can, but there is
a crippling guilt in her visual presence, based on

487
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:22,410
everything that's happening here. You know that
there's a mutual understanding that, while no one

488
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:27,630
knows the true reason why all this is happening,
everyone seems to have a stake as to why it

489
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,241
happened and possibly may have been somewhat at
fault. And as she nods, she looks at Drake and

490
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:38,243
Drake gives her a nod and begins casting a spell.
As his fingers twirl in the air, these blue sparks

491
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:46,158
trail his fingertips as it draws this large spiral
of electrical energy that holds itself in place.

492
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:51,562
It bursts out and encompasses both their bodies
and their forms all of a sudden shrink down and

493
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:56,376
shutter into these two sparks of energy that then
arc off, and you can see these two bolts of

494
00:32:56,376 --> 00:33:01,513
electricity now coasting through the sky, bouncing
off roads, bouncing off rock, bouncing off a tree.

495
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,223
They both are traveling via spark across the
countryside.

496
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,290
LAURA: How the fuck do we get that ability?

497
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,562
MARISHA: I don't know, but I want it.

498
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:10,819
LAURA: She's so fucking cool. Do you think that
was her or do you think that was Drake?

499
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,197
MATT: Drake cast it.

500
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:13,805
LAURA: Oh man, that's so cool!

501
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:18,529
SAM: Should we go to sleep?

502
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,932
MARISHA: Well, I'm doing my Commune with Nature
spell. I drop down and mediate.

503
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:25,098
MATT: All righty.

504
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:32,832
SAM: If only I had taken a dump in the middle of
town, I could see what's going on right now.

505
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:34,917
(laughter)

506
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:37,441
TRAVIS: Hindsight is ten--

507
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:38,698
SAM: Other number.

508
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:41,175
(laughter)

509
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:45,972
MATT: Okay, three facts of your choice. As you sit
in the temple quietly and connect yourself with

510
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:52,110
the land and the foliage of the surrounding area
of Emon, what are your questions?

511
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,211
MARISHA: Do I sense Gilmore's presence?

512
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:57,951
MATT: What's the radius on this, three miles?

513
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,816
MARISHA: A few miles.

514
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:02,885
MATT: You do sense a presence.

515
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:04,827
MARISHA: A presence.

516
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:06,625
MATT: A very weak presence.

517
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,956
LAURA: (gasp) Oh, no!

518
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,311
SAM: That could mean he's far away or that he's
dead.

519
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:17,686
MARISHA: Can I focus in even harder and find
where that presence is coming from more directly?

520
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:24,442
MATT: The direction that best you can ascertain is
it's in the direction of Abdar's Promenade.

521
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:26,867
MARISHA: His shop?

522
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,972
MATT: That's where his shop is, yes.

523
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:31,973
SAM: Good to know.

524
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:39,355
MARISHA: Okay. Last question, do I sense Uriel?

525
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:43,635
MATT: Within your three-mile range, you do not.

526
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:45,987
LAURA: Maybe he--

527
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,722
TRAVIS: He got to moving.

528
00:34:47,722 --> 00:34:49,007
SAM: Or he's dead.

529
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:53,266
LAURA: Okay, when you are sensing things, does
that mean you would sense if they were alive or

530
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:56,477
you wouldn't sense them at all if they were dead?

531
00:34:56,477 --> 00:35:01,737
MATT: The questions were: are they in the city?
Which direction are they? Those are essentially

532
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,304
the answers that you get through the connection of
nature.

533
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,925
LAURA: Okay, so they could be dead in the city and
you'd still sense them?

534
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:09,582
MATT: That's possible.

535
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:12,822
MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to say.

536
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:16,853
LIAM: He could have gone to the harbor. He could
have fled through the tunnels we don't even know

537
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:17,686
about.

538
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:19,165
LAURA: He could have a teleportation circle.

539
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:20,917
MARISHA: We should check his shop first.

540
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,659
TRAVIS: Yeah. If Uriel's farther away, it's--

541
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,592
MARISHA: Uriel, I don't know.

542
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:30,238
Maybe he's dead, maybe he's gone, I don't
know, I don't know.

543
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,837
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a moo point.

544
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:38,979
MARISHA: How about this, let's find Gilmore, if
he's alive or dead then that will answer a lot of

545
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,484
questions, how's that?

546
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:42,553
LIAM: I agree.

547
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:43,852
TALIESIN: Yes.

548
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:52,461
LIAM: And if he did not make it, we still go to
his shop.

549
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:54,636
SAM: Take everything.

550
00:35:54,636 --> 00:36:01,154
LIAM: Use whatever's left. It's what Gilmore would
want.

551
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:02,864
SAM: It's true.

552
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,562
TRAVIS: I agree.

553
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,405
LAURA: We go then, if it hasn't been ransacked
already.

554
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,770
TRAVIS: Let's go find that magic fucker.

555
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,744
MARISHA: So we're going now? Tonight?

556
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:12,128
TALIESIN: Sleep and then go.

557
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,495
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe we should go.

558
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:18,746
LAURA: Should we stealth in and see what we can
see? I don't know, I feel like we need to rest, y'all.

559
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,522
MARISHA: How bad are we?

560
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:25,604
LIAM: (laughing) I should probably rest.

561
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:28,154
ASHLEY: I'm at 25.

562
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:29,551
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

563
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:32,087
LAURA: I'm pretty low and I'm almost out of dice.

564
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:37,548
TRAVIS: I can stay guard with the rest of
everybody else, because I'm okay.

565
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:43,153
LIAM: They're expecting-- Thordak is expecting to
sit on us like a bunch of eggs in a basket. We're

566
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:44,911
fine for the night, we go tomorrow.

567
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,108
LAURA: Potentially.

568
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:49,876
MARISHA: Okay.

569
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,983
MATT: All right, you guys take a long rest?

570
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:54,747
TALIESIN: Quick question, where is the skull?

571
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:57,337
TRAVIS: You fucking-- that was my question.

572
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:59,576
LAURA: I don't know, what are you talking about?

573
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,990
MATT: Who had the skull last?

574
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,255
TRAVIS: You expect me to remember those sort of
things?

575
00:37:06,255 --> 00:37:08,370
MARISHA: I remember.

576
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,606
TALIESIN: Either you have it or I have it. I don't
remember.

577
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,983
MATT: The last person to hold it was Vex.

578
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,972
TALIESIN: Was Vex. Okay, excellent. I have a
perfectly reasonable hiding place or, if you like,

579
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,192
you can take it.

580
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:21,807
TRAVIS: Yeah, your ass.

581
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,923
LAURA: Yes, I think it's reasonably well-hidden at
this moment.

582
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,475
TALIESIN: Excellent.

583
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,720
SAM: Where is it?

584
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,973
LAURA: I don't know.

585
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,334
MARISHA: Well-hidden.

586
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:34,761
TALIESIN: That will do.

587
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:42,938
MATT: All right. You guys find yourselves, as best
as you can, resting for the evening. It is an

588
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:50,662
evening of tossing and turning for a lot of you.
Flashes of memories. Scanlan, you are plagued by

589
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:54,428
the thought of your newly discovered daughter
being not far outside the city when all this went

590
00:37:54,428 --> 00:38:01,979
down. Percy, you have flashes of the idea of
Whitestone, recently saved and brought to freedom,

591
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:09,484
being torn asunder by dragons not two weeks
afterwards. You are plagued by visions of the

592
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:19,697
Pyrah, the moment that Thordak must have torn
through and the havoc that was wreaked afterward.

593
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:27,607
Both of you can't help but think back to when you first
returned to Byroden and seeing the smoldering ruin

594
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:35,399
that you now know to be the work of the Cinder
King 15 years before, and those words about

595
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:42,753
wondering if that was the last thing your mother saw.
Grog, you want that skull.

596
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,686
(laughter)

597
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:56,028
MATT: Pike, your thoughts go back to Vasselheim
and the people there that you, out of necessity

598
00:38:56,028 --> 00:39:02,005
and need for friendship and to protect them, left
behind, knowing that they would be safe, and

599
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:06,492
now the uncertainty as to whether or not
Vasselheim still stands and whether or not you

600
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:12,262
left them to a fate you could have protected them.
That guilt rides on you as well. You guys complete

601
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:22,484
your long rest, you restore full hit points and
you get back half of your max hit dice. You can

602
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:29,264
only get back half, so if you spent more than half of
your hit dice, you're still at-- just so you guys

603
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,616
are aware of that.

604
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:33,053
MARISHA: Wait, what? We only restore half each
night?

605
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:34,218
MATT: Yes.

606
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:35,910
TALIESIN: Not half of what's missing, but--

607
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,075
MARISHA: Just half.

608
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:43,373
MATT: Yeah. So if you used eight of your hit dice,
you are only going to get back, at level 12, six

609
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:44,590
hit dice.

610
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,961
MARISHA: Good to know. I don't think I used any.

611
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:51,023
MATT: So, it is a gradual declining resource.
Hasn't come up too much beforehand, but I want to

612
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:58,837
make sure you guys were aware of that. Anyway, as
you come to in the morning, you can smell-- you're

613
00:39:58,837 --> 00:40:03,083
used to Laina cooking a very nice breakfast. You
smell food being cooked, but it's much more basic

614
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:10,578
for the masses. As you eventually groggily find
your way downstairs, pardon the pun, you can see

615
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:16,505
there is essentially a gruel pot and there is a
soup line and food is being served best to their

616
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:25,026
capabilities to the people that have taken refuge
in Greyskull Keep. You are welcome to do as you please.

617
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:31,582
LAURA: We should head out.

618
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,073
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

619
00:40:33,073 --> 00:40:35,325
SAM: We're just going to march into the city?

620
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:37,216
LAURA: We're going to march under the city.

621
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:38,953
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to check out that tunnel
first.

622
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,859
SAM: The tunnel just goes to the other side of the
wall.

623
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:44,581
LIAM: We don't even know where the tunnel is. We
need to find an entrance to said tunnel.

624
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:47,581
MATT: The tunnel, actually--

625
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:52,313
TRAVIS: And then-- sorry, I was going to say and
then when we get to the the city, then we figure

626
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:54,013
out what we do.

627
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:57,306
SAM: Grog, good thinking. (laughs)

628
00:40:57,306 --> 00:40:59,244
TRAVIS: Leave it to me.

629
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:03,468
MATT: So, the tunnel has been installed to the
back of the kitchen. There is a large pantry there

630
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:09,970
and the tunnel is a trap door that is currently
set by the very, very back of the pantry.

631
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:18,651
Actually, not too dissimilar from the entrance to
the Clasp in the Diamond Nest Inn. However, it's

632
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:25,271
much smaller and is a small single-person tunnel.
You have to go single-file and it's not very tall.

633
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:29,080
Grog, you are going to have to almost crawl
through at your height and everyone else would

634
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,555
have to hunch down, except for you and Pike are
fine. You guys are tiny enough. It's about a

635
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:33,774
gnome-sized tunnel.

636
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,134
SAM: Nice.

637
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:41,632
MATT: And as you guys go into the pantry, Laina is
like, "Oh, don't-- I'm trying-- where's everyone going?"

638
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,896
and sees you all clown-car into the
pantry.

639
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:46,541
LAURA: Before we left, I wanted to find Jarett
really fast.

640
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:52,288
MATT: Okay, Jarett is currently outside of the
keep in the main courtyard area, crossbow at the

641
00:41:52,288 --> 00:41:55,847
ready, keeping his eyes to the sky, mostly looking
off in the direction of Emon.

642
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:07,698
LAURA: I walk up and I hand him a bag of 300 gold
and I say, this is, far and away, so much more

643
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:14,562
than we asked you to do when we hired you. And I
appreciate everything you're doing. Take care of

644
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:19,756
the keep. Use this money to take care of the
people here.

645
00:42:19,756 --> 00:42:26,371
MATT: He takes it and throws it in the air and
catches it. "I appreciate that. I take great pride

646
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:32,405
"in my work and I assure you, I would sooner die
than let this place fall."

647
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:36,174
LAURA: Then I give him additional 100 gold.

648
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:38,180
SAM: What is going on?

649
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,774
MATT: As you pass him the 100 gold, he puts his
hand up and actually pushes your hand away and

650
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:47,731
says, "I appreciate the sentiment, but you've
already done too much. You hired me for a reason.

651
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,618
"I'm doing my job, but your generosity is noted."

652
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:54,337
SAM: Ah, he's so honorable!

653
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:58,021
TRAVIS: Is his hair blowing in the wind as he
rejects that amount?

654
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,768
MATT: His hair is really short.

655
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:03,676
LAURA: I resist the urge to mug down with him and
I walk away.

656
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:06,301
MATT: Okay.

657
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:08,085
LIAM: What are you waiting for?

658
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,194
(laughter)

659
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,292
MATT: All right.

660
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:12,714
TRAVIS: Yeah, you might die. He might die.

661
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:16,146
LIAM: Yeah. Look at that big pouty bottom lip. Go
get that.

662
00:43:16,146 --> 00:43:17,897
(laughter)

663
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:19,585
MATT: Some of that Marquet--

664
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:21,402
(laughter)

665
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,209
MARISHA: Sexy, sexy exotic accent.

666
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:30,028
MATT: -- and that Ank'Harel caramel skin. Jarett's
a hottie.

667
00:43:30,028 --> 00:43:34,363
LIAM: I just saw 100 pictures drawn in a instant.

668
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,534
(laughter)

669
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:38,525
TALIESIN: With a flair.

670
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:43,387
MARISHA: Wait, you hear that? It's pens hitting
the paper. It's fanfiction right now.

671
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:50,360
MATT: So, as you guys make your way through the
tunnel, and it's a long, very simple tunnel. The

672
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,046
construction is solid. You don't feel as you walk
through that any of it is in worry of collapse.

673
00:43:54,046 --> 00:44:00,782
There has been no sufficient seismic activity or
impact above ground to warrant that directly above

674
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:07,961
the tunnel. And you continue to trudge ahead and
it's pitch black. Those of you with darkvision

675
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,963
probably take the forefront.

676
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:14,781
TRAVIS: Is there a light vision? I'm on it.

677
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:18,237
MARISHA: I go ahead and light up a hand.

678
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:24,311
MATT: So, you guys, all of you have low-light,
darkvision. You're fine and Percy is the only one

679
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:33,737
who needs the aid in this. But as you continue
forward for a good 25, 30 minutes or so, the

680
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:38,511
tunnel comes to a small stop and there's a very
simple rope ladder that leads upward.

681
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,093
LAURA: I put my hood up.

682
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:43,587
MATT: Who's going up first?

683
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:45,229
TRAVIS: Is there anything past that?

684
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:52,442
MATT: The ladder goes up and goes into a small
wooden slat. It's not even a door. It's almost

685
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:54,695
like a wood pallet.

686
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,593
LAURA: Get up there. See what you see.

687
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,014
TRAVIS: You sneaky dick.

688
00:44:58,014 --> 00:45:03,437
LIAM: Okay, at the bottom of the ladder, because
she's right behind me. You know, you never cease

689
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:05,217
to impress me.

690
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:08,899
MATT: Okay, you go up. Roll a stealth check.

691
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:13,793
LIAM: 25.

692
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:19,467
MATT: All right, good to know. So, as you get up
to the top, you feel the wooden slats on top and

693
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:23,524
as you push, there's not any weight to them. They
give way immediately, and as you push it aside,

694
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:28,948
you can see you're inside a small wooden
structure. It is enclosed and a little bit of the

695
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:35,723
morning light is peeking through the space between
the slats of wood. Looking about the general size

696
00:45:35,723 --> 00:45:40,700
and height, it appears to almost be an outhouse
structure, but there is no actual outhouse here

697
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,906
or, at least where there once was, has recently
been converted to the exit of your tunnel.

698
00:45:43,906 --> 00:45:45,770
LIAM: Smells like jerky.

699
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,928
(laughter)

700
00:45:47,928 --> 00:45:50,148
TALIESIN: Right there with you.

701
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,671
MATT: There is a door that leads out.

702
00:45:52,671 --> 00:45:56,370
LIAM: Okay, I will crack it an inch and look
through.

703
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:02,245
MATT: Okay. There is a chain on the outside of the
door that keeps it shut with a big, thick lock at

704
00:46:02,245 --> 00:46:03,474
the bottom.

705
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,991
LIAM: Is there enough room to get my hand through
to the other side?

706
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:11,263
MATT: I'd say, yes, with your experience and your
lithe form, you manage to just eke it through and

707
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:13,316
you can get your wrist past, but anything
beyond--

708
00:46:13,316 --> 00:46:14,870
LIAM: I'm double-jointed, Matt.

709
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:19,785
MATT: And with that double joint you get <i>that</i>
close. So, yeah, you can reach it.

710
00:46:19,785 --> 00:46:21,753
LIAM: All right, so, I can feel a lock there?

711
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:22,708
MATT: Yeah.

712
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,394
LIAM: All right, I'm going to one-hand pick this
lock.

713
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:29,463
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll. This is a difficult
maneuver, even with your experience. Given that

714
00:46:29,463 --> 00:46:32,310
you can't actually see the front of the lock,
you're having to literally feel your way through it.

715
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,055
TRAVIS: Roll high, you pointy-eared bastard.

716
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:36,327
LAURA: Natural 20.

717
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,795
MARISHA: It's like unclasping a bra.

718
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,493
TALIESIN: How do you do that?

719
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:42,446
LIAM: That's 30.

720
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:48,743
MATT: (laughs) 30? With a single moment, you,
actually feeling with one thumb, you're feeling

721
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:53,453
the vibration of each tumbler on the inside of the
lock and as each one progressively clicks, you

722
00:46:53,453 --> 00:46:57,913
eventually get to the fourth one before (tink) and
it hangs open loosely, within a matter of 40

723
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:01,781
seconds. You wish other people would have seen
that happen because that was pretty, pretty cool

724
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,899
maneuver. But you know, at least.

725
00:47:03,899 --> 00:47:06,172
LIAM: Come on up. It wasn't even locked.

726
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:08,748
ALL: Aw.

727
00:47:08,748 --> 00:47:11,045
(laughter)

728
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:16,447
MATT: He's so modest. Oh no, we lost Ashley! We
lost an Ashley.

729
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,245
LIAM: I've got it. I've got it.

730
00:47:19,245 --> 00:47:20,761
MARISHA: Cleric down.

731
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:22,613
MATT: As you all climb back up--

732
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:25,930
LAURA: Stealth, stealth, stealth, everybody. I
cast Pass Without a Trace.

733
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,368
MARISHA: Oh. She's going to call back. She said we
turned into robots. She disconnected.

734
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:29,813
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

735
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,749
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

736
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:32,937
MATT: Okay, good. So--

737
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:37,741
LAURA: Wait, wait! How's Trinket going to climb up
this rope, y'all? Polymorph?

738
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:39,907
MARISHA: I do have Polymorph.

739
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:41,531
SAM: Oh no.

740
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:44,191
MARISHA: We need to make him tinier, anyway. What
do you want him to be?

741
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:46,141
SAM: We should leave him.

742
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:47,425
LAURA: Shut up!

743
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:49,895
MATT: Which, for the record, Trinket going through
this tunnel looks like the cleaner in

744
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:54,907
Labyrinth. It fills the entire tunnel. He's like
(bear noises) having to pull his way through.

745
00:47:54,907 --> 00:48:07,271
LAURA: Okay, what if we polymorph him into a very
small raccoon? But he's got hands, you know, so he

746
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,598
can hold things?

747
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,968
LIAM: What about a wolverine or a badger?

748
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:12,183
MARISHA: I have a question.

749
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,874
SAM: Honey badger doesn't care.

750
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,502
LAURA: Honey badger don't give a shit. It just
takes what it wants.

751
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:24,598
MARISHA: If I polymorph Trinket, can I then use
Beast Sense to be able to see through him? Would

752
00:48:24,598 --> 00:48:26,078
that be able to work?

753
00:48:26,078 --> 00:48:27,419
MATT: What does Beast Sense do?

754
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:30,864
MARISHA: Beast Sense lets me see through the eyes
of a beast.

755
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,247
MATT: You can do that with Trinket regardless.

756
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:37,352
MARISHA: But does it stack with Polymorph? And if
he is like polymorphed into-- I mean, I guess he's

757
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:38,674
still a beast.

758
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:42,546
MATT: If beast sense is a concentration, then no.
You will lose one to do the other.

759
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:43,778
MARISHA: All right.

760
00:48:43,778 --> 00:48:45,420
MATT: Yeah, and Beast Sense is concentration.

761
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,270
LAURA: Is Polymorph a concentration?

762
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,612
MATT: Yes, it is. So one or the other.

763
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:52,841
MARISHA: It's fine. But if I turned him into a
bird, I can make him an aerial scout, is what I

764
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:56,072
was thinking, like the wargs in Game of Thrones.

765
00:48:56,072 --> 00:49:01,901
MATT: Or you can become one yourself. What are you
doing?

766
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:07,980
MARISHA: I will make him a cute little sewer rat
or like--

767
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,001
LAURA: No! He can hang on to me.

768
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:13,610
TRAVIS: Oh my god, make him something!

769
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,341
LAURA: Will he still get his armor?

770
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,568
MARISHA: Can I make him a lemur? (laughs)

771
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:18,732
MATT: You can.

772
00:49:18,732 --> 00:49:20,888
LAURA: But lemurs are slow, dude. Raccoons are
cool.

773
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:23,210
MARISHA: How about a red panda?

774
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,439
LAURA: Red panda!

775
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,896
MARISHA: I'm going to make him a red panda!

776
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,239
TALIESIN: Red panda. That's cool.

777
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:30,004
SAM: Wait, wait, wait, can a red panda climb a
rope ladder any better than--

778
00:49:30,004 --> 00:49:39,781
MATT: As the rest of the party climbs their way
up, during Vex and Keyleth's bickering over what

779
00:49:39,781 --> 00:49:43,864
form Trinket should take, Trinket, if you've ever
seen a bear roll its eyes before, this is the

780
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:49,296
moment. As it fills the entire tunnel it goes
(bear noises), with a kill-me-now expression.

781
00:49:49,296 --> 00:49:51,456
Eventually, you decide on a red panda.

782
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:52,833
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a good breed.

783
00:49:52,833 --> 00:50:00,798
MATT: The mystical red panda from Wildemount. You
extend your hand and Trinket's form shrinks into

784
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,901
this small, temporarily elevated red panda, and
falls to the ground.

785
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:11,209
LAURA: Aww, I love you! He's so cute! I pick him
up and I tell him to hang on to me.

786
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:18,648
MATT: He does and wraps around your neck like the
foxtail you already have there. You guys climb up

787
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:24,860
and as you emerge, you see now, you're at the
very, very back of an alleyway that is buttressed

788
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,571
against the inside of the outer wall. So you're
inside the city. You're in this small, very, very

789
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:37,427
well-out-of-the-way alleyway, this back alley that
ends at your outhouse, as well as a secondary one

790
00:50:37,427 --> 00:50:43,076
next to you that appears to be functional, based
on the smell. And there is trash and junk back

791
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:46,510
here. It's definitely one of the forgotten corners
of Emon.

792
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,427
TALIESIN: You have your map.

793
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:51,810
SAM: Yeah, we're right here. Where's Gilmore's
again?

794
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,162
MATT: Abdar's Promenade, to the northeastern--

795
00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:58,086
LAURA: Stealth. Can we all stealth?

796
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:00,640
SAM: That's up here. Wow, we have to cross the
entire city.

797
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,439
MARISHA: And we've got Pass Without a Trace.

798
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,134
SAM: But we could go along the wall.

799
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:05,224
LAURA: Let's do it.

800
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:07,736
SAM: All the way along the outside wall.

801
00:51:07,736 --> 00:51:12,209
MARISHA: Do we want to go through the city or
along the outside of the city? Are we going to

802
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,385
take the long way or the direct path?

803
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:19,430
LIAM: The long way, the slow way, the careful
way.

804
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,119
SAM: Take the beltway?

805
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,167
LIAM: Stealthy.

806
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,864
TALIESIN: Stealthy.

807
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:25,696
MATT: All right. Everyone roll stealth, please.

808
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:29,023
LAURA: You add ten because--

809
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:30,673
SAM: We add ten?

810
00:51:30,673 --> 00:51:41,318
MATT: Ashley, stealth for you as well with
disadvantage, but you add ten. Still there,

811
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:42,711
Ashley?

812
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:43,987
LAURA: Oh, no!

813
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:45,253
TRAVIS: Ashley?

814
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:49,424
LIAM: I'm hanging up on you. I still love you, but
I'm going to hang up.

815
00:51:49,424 --> 00:51:52,875
MATT: All right, so, call back, and you guys,
stealth checks?

816
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:56,469
TALIESIN: 39.

817
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:57,429
MARISHA: 19.

818
00:51:57,429 --> 00:51:58,631
SAM: 25.

819
00:51:58,631 --> 00:51:59,676
LAURA: 33.

820
00:51:59,676 --> 00:52:00,640
TRAVIS: 23.

821
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,561
LIAM: 25.

822
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:02,318
MATT: All right.

823
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:03,277
LAURA: You added ten?

824
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:04,187
LIAM: What?

825
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,738
LAURA: Add ten to it. Pass Without a Trace.

826
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:07,133
LIAM: 35, then, motherfuckers.

827
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,449
TALIESIN: Wait, 29, sorry.

828
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,579
MATT: Okay, there we go, and 19 with the plus
ten?

829
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,395
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled shitty.

830
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:19,275
MATT: Okay, all right. There we go. Hi, Ashley.

831
00:52:19,275 --> 00:52:20,992
MARISHA: Sorry, Ashley.

832
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:22,526
LAURA: Can she hear?

833
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:24,633
LIAM: (robot voice) Hello, I am Pike. I am happy
to be here.

834
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:27,581
TALIESIN: I forgot you can do that.

835
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,009
LIAM: Ashley rolled a four. She texted me.

836
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:30,459
LAURA: So 14.

837
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:36,603
MATT: Okay, so you guys step out of this alleyway
and the first thing that catches you is the

838
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:39,069
visual.

839
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:40,713
LAURA: Chained back up the outhouse.

840
00:52:40,713 --> 00:52:44,240
MATT: Okay, so you chained it back and put the
lock back on. As you step back out into the center

841
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,297
of the first road you come across, the crossroads to
this alleyway, you look up and can see there are,

842
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:55,415
even through the night, a good two dozen streams
of smoke billowing out from different parts of the

843
00:52:55,415 --> 00:53:02,429
city, where, throughout the entire evening, there
has been buildings burning, crumbling, or fires of

844
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:10,564
indeterminate origin throughout the city that are
still spreading. There's the perpetual smell of

845
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:15,786
smoke and dust in the air, and you can see every
now and then, the wind will blow a bit and a

846
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:20,574
little bit of ash will be thrown up in the air and
come to rest. Much of what you see around you is

847
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:24,740
intact, the buildings directly around you on this
side, everything seems intact, though there's very

848
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:31,248
little signs of life on this immediate corner. It
looks like either everyone is inside or this part

849
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:38,660
of the city has been abandoned or people are
keeping out of the streets at this point. So, what

850
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,445
do you guys want to do?

851
00:53:40,445 --> 00:53:43,017
LAURA: Go along the wall to the other side to get
to Gilmore's?

852
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:44,288
MATT: Okay.

853
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:45,498
LAURA: Sneaky.

854
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:52,895
MATT: All right. You guys coast along the wall, to
the very southward side, trudging up across the

855
00:53:52,895 --> 00:54:01,493
main gate, which as you can see now-- there's
normally a very heavy guard presence on the south

856
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:06,361
gate to Emon. The gate is currently partially
opened and you can see a bunch of the guards as

857
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:13,052
well as a number of individuals in the city
currently frozen in place in the midst of a sudden

858
00:54:13,052 --> 00:54:20,487
bit of chaos. You can see the guards with shields
and pikes at the ready, screaming and looking up

859
00:54:20,487 --> 00:54:26,716
into the sky, their final moment trapped now in
that frozen horrifying visage. You see people

860
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:30,415
running, trying to make their way out of the gate,
and couldn't quite get past in time and the

861
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:33,960
gate itself has a large sheet of ice that is
frozen against it that's slowly thawing. You can

862
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,854
see the ground around them is turning muddy with
all the moisture that's slowly melting away as the

863
00:54:38,854 --> 00:54:40,067
day progresses.

864
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,662
LAURA: And they're like the people in our keep?
They're past the point of healing?

865
00:54:42,662 --> 00:54:45,540
MATT: You can certainly check and inquire.

866
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:51,473
LIAM: They've been here for eight hours at least.
They're gone.

867
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:53,744
TRAVIS: Yeah, leave it.

868
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:59,571
LAURA: I want to see if Cure Wounds is-- I'm going
to just try?

869
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,231
MARISHA: I assist.

870
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:07,792
MATT: Okay. So you go up and reach out and cast
Cure Wounds on one of the frozen bodies, and your

871
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:11,425
hands touch it and you can feel the ice because
it's still very cold to the touch, though it's

872
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:16,530
damp and the moisture is gathering and dripping
down off certain elbows and portions of the body

873
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:21,883
that are the lowest. You complete the spell and
feel the warmth of the cure spell extend past your

874
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:30,458
fingers with no sign of reaction or life within
the body. This poor woman, apron on, looking over

875
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:35,825
her shoulder running, holding what little
belongings she had, is there, her final moment

876
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:39,790
captured as she stares off in the direction of
where you assume Vorugal swooped towards the south

877
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,920
gate, before making their way towards Greyskull
Keep the night before.

878
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,134
TRAVIS: Let's go before we're discovered,
quickly.

879
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:49,012
MARISHA: Okay.

880
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,937
MATT: As you guys tread across the main
thoroughfare, and it's the one point where you are

881
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:59,444
inescapably out in the open, and as you're taking
a moment touching the corpse of this woman frozen

882
00:55:59,444 --> 00:56:06,122
in place, Vex, you catch out the corner of your
eye what appears to be a figure stepping towards

883
00:56:06,122 --> 00:56:08,100
you in the center of the street.

884
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,010
SAM: Wait, you see someone?

885
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:16,905
MATT: As you notify the rest of the group, you
guys look over and you can see now, stepping from

886
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:22,975
one of the alleyways, there is a humanoid figure
walking through the road, cloak draped behind in

887
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:34,651
the back, hood up, wide shoulders, and is not
seemingly making any attempt to be unseen or really

888
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:40,232
hiding their presence. This is someone who is
beelining for your group in this moment.

889
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:41,924
MARISHA: He's heading towards us?

890
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:42,888
MATT: Yes.

891
00:56:42,888 --> 00:56:44,302
MARISHA: Yeah, does he see us?

892
00:56:44,302 --> 00:56:45,779
MATT: Heading right towards you.

893
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:47,637
LAURA: I take out a arrow and say, stop!

894
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,955
MARISHA: I do flame hands.

895
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:55,327
MATT: Okay. The figure stops for a moment and
pulls the hood back, and you can see now,

896
00:56:55,327 --> 00:57:04,028
revealed, a-- looking humanoid but the features
are more intense and thick. A very square jaw. The

897
00:57:04,028 --> 00:57:11,721
skin has a slight grayish-green tint to it. What
looks like one tooth underneath, and this is a

898
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:19,398
half-orc individual. Wearing a black cloak and very
simple studded leather armor. If our guest would

899
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,243
like to step on to the stage.

900
00:57:21,243 --> 00:57:23,064
ALL: Ooh!

901
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:27,159
LIAM: Yeah! Mixing it up!

902
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:30,930
MATT: So, just to let you guys know, we have a
guest joining us this evening. The illustrious and

903
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,769
talented Jason Charles Miller, who is an--

904
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:34,041
SAM: Where is he going?

905
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,216
MATT: Between you guys right there. Yeah, there
you go.

906
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:38,670
MARISHA: Come squeeze.

907
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,171
MATT: Jason is going to join us for this evening
of gameplay.

908
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:44,344
JASON: My first action will require me to get up,
so.

909
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:50,335
MATT: Okay, well, get low for a moment, so I can
introduce you. So you can say hey! This is Jason.

910
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,207
Jason is a voice actor, actually the voice of
Drizzt Do'Urden right now, if you know who--

911
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:58,978
MARISHA: Oh, shut the fuck up! I didn't know
that!

912
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:03,804
MATT: Yeah, so that's pretty awesome. As well as
the writer of our theme song, our Critical Role

913
00:58:03,804 --> 00:58:07,682
theme song, which we are working on a new intro
right now. And in the near future we will have that for

914
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:08,970
you guys.

915
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,578
MARISHA: You can download it on iTunes.

916
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:14,600
MATT: Yes, you can. We will have that coming out
soon but yes, so Jason, thanks for joining us

917
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,883
tonight.

918
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,371
JASON: Sure, thanks for having me.

919
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:18,318
MARISHA: Hi, Jason.

920
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,154
MATT: We'll give you the full, whole-- at end the
show, but nonetheless the half-orc approaches,

921
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:24,781
lowers his hood.

922
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:33,250
JASON: Okay, so I actually start speaking in
Thieves' Cant to Vex here, so I've got to whisper

923
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,167
something.

924
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,109
MATT: Okay, go for it. So as the orc lowers his
hood, he begins to--

925
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,172
MARISHA: Why don't you make him come over here?

926
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:39,068
LAURA: Who are you talking about?

927
00:58:39,068 --> 00:58:43,096
JASON: Vax, sorry, the-- The person that can speak
Thieves' Cant.

928
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:44,906
LAURA: I can speak Thieves' Cant, too.

929
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:46,119
JASON: But I'm talking to him.

930
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,690
TALIESIN: Thieves can't speak. Ooh.

931
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,419
MATT: And whispers to the two of them.

932
00:58:50,419 --> 00:58:52,268
MARISHA: These are tiny tables.

933
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:55,994
MATT: So suddenly the orc begins to utter a series
of strange sounds like double talk and gibberish.

934
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:59,836
LAURA: I'm reading his damn lips as he's doing
it.

935
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:03,966
MATT: All right, and you, knowing Thieves' Cant,
pick up the details. So you can let her know as

936
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:14,030
well. The rest of you see this orc speaking
nonsense and a very brief reaction from the twins.

937
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:17,549
MARISHA: Look, he's been under a lot of stress,
all right?

938
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:20,660
LIAM: He's trying to get us to join scientology,
that's all.

939
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,949
(laughter)

940
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:23,569
MARISHA: Our thetan levels are off the charts
right now.

941
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:25,701
TALIESIN: My thetan level's at 16 right now.

942
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:29,151
LAURA: You're a member of the Clasp, then?

943
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,008
JASON: Yes.

944
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:32,409
MARISHA: Oh.

945
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:38,489
JASON: You're the first faces I recognize. I've
been hiding here since the attack.

946
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:40,802
MARISHA: You recognized us, why? How?

947
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:43,801
JASON: I'm a member of the Clasp.

948
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:45,473
LIAM: Did you all make it?

949
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:47,943
MARISHA: We were there recently.

950
00:59:47,943 --> 00:59:49,414
LIAM: What's left?

951
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:56,949
JASON: I don't know. I was on a mission up above
ground when the attack happened. I'm trying

952
00:59:56,949 --> 01:00:03,125
desperately to get back to see who is left. My
name is Garthok.

953
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,336
SAM: Garthok?

954
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:05,386
JASON: Yes.

955
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:12,298
SAM: We are Vox Machina. I am the de facto leader.
My name is Scanlan Shorthalt.

956
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:18,528
JASON: I know who you are, and you are the first
people I've made myself visible to. You're the first

957
01:00:18,528 --> 01:00:22,893
people that I recognize or even know that I can
trust.

958
01:00:22,893 --> 01:00:26,524
MARISHA: Have you been through the city? How much
is left?

959
01:00:26,524 --> 01:00:36,244
JASON: It is not-- it's indescribable. There is
incredible destruction.

960
01:00:36,244 --> 01:00:39,267
MARISHA: Have you encountered any more survivors?

961
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:43,721
MATT: Which you have. As you walked through the
city, you have noticed there are many survivors of

962
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:49,602
the town. A lot of them have kept inside, but
there are a number that are actually running

963
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,263
through and looting the town.

964
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:52,413
LAURA: Ugh.

965
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:54,215
LIAM: What was your name again?

966
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:55,307
JASON: Garthok.

967
01:00:55,307 --> 01:00:58,921
LIAM: Garthok. What of the Spirelings? What of the
leaders of the Clasp?

968
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,824
JASON: All I know is what I knew before the
attack.

969
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:11,545
LIAM: We've come here looking for survivors. We
don't intend to stay long. You are welcome to come

970
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:12,705
with us.

971
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:20,688
LAURA: Are you one of the people looting? You said
you saw other people doing the same.

972
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:30,718
JASON: I'm not a looter. I was on a classified
mission above ground, and now that's all gone to

973
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:34,533
shit basically, so I'm trying to get back to our
headquarters.

974
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:40,573
SAM: Garthok, are you familiar with tunnels or
secret passageways around the city at all?

975
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:44,198
JASON: You could say yes. Absolutely.

976
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:45,925
SAM: Are we near any?

977
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:48,612
LAURA: We need to get across town and not be
seen.

978
01:01:48,612 --> 01:01:50,865
MARISHA: We are trying to get to the Abdar's
Promenade.

979
01:01:50,865 --> 01:01:53,496
LIAM: Wait, show me your brand.

980
01:01:53,496 --> 01:01:59,522
MATT: He reveals the back of the cloak and you do
indeed see the brand of the Clasp. The same one

981
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:01,924
you carry between the shoulder blades.

982
01:02:01,924 --> 01:02:05,419
MARISHA: Do you know each other?

983
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:09,167
(laughter)

984
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,890
LIAM: It's a pretty big organization.

985
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:16,316
MATT: There are certain tunnels that traverse
underneath Emon, specifically amongst the Clasp.

986
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:23,929
However, two of the locations to the south of the
city, one in the Graveyard District and one in the

987
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:30,122
Temple District, which you guys are adjacent to
right now, those are the two that immediately come

988
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:36,681
to mind. The Temple one that you are nearby
seeking has been completely demolished and is

989
01:02:36,681 --> 01:02:41,014
unusable. There's one to the Graveyard District.
There's one north of Abdar's Promenade that could

990
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:48,522
possibly be of use to you. Those are the only ones
that come to mind that are nearby.

991
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:55,809
TALIESIN: Well, if we're heading that way anyway.
We stop by Gilmore's and we do need to check in

992
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,625
with the Clasp, anyway.

993
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,219
LIAM: Maybe.

994
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:01,490
TALIESIN: They're going to be helpful.

995
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,686
LIAM: Maybe.

996
01:03:02,686 --> 01:03:04,068
TRAVIS: Are we out in the open right now?

997
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:05,703
MATT: You are out in the open right now.

998
01:03:05,703 --> 01:03:11,446
TRAVIS: Can we fucking get inside, please?

999
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:17,051
LIAM: We need to get to Gilmore's Glorious Goods.
Do you know where that is?

1000
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:18,806
JASON: Yes, I can lead you there.

1001
01:03:18,806 --> 01:03:20,305
LIAM: Underground?

1002
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:23,655
JASON: I could, if the temple entrance wasn't
destroyed.

1003
01:03:23,655 --> 01:03:25,384
MARISHA: I might be able to clear it out.

1004
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,106
TRAVIS: You want to walk towards the temple?

1005
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:30,277
SAM: We're near the Temple District now.

1006
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:32,695
MARISHA: We can take the tunnels under--

1007
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:37,205
SAM: But if the entrance to the tunnel was
destroyed, it's best not to risk it. Let's keep going.

1008
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:38,868
LAURA: And we'll make a lot of noise clearing it
out.

1009
01:03:38,868 --> 01:03:40,073
TALIESIN: That's true.

1010
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:41,363
LAURA: Best to skirt.

1011
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:42,825
LIAM: Building to building.

1012
01:03:42,825 --> 01:03:45,285
SAM: Are you okay with stealth?

1013
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:51,303
MARISHA: I might be able to tunnel us to the
closest tunnel system, from right here.

1014
01:03:51,303 --> 01:03:56,301
LAURA: Do it then.

1015
01:03:56,301 --> 01:04:00,413
MATT: How do you intend to do this?

1016
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:04,886
MARISHA: Move Earth. Sixth level.

1017
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:07,823
LAURA: Whoa, you're using a 6th-level spell right
now?

1018
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:10,436
MARISHA: Do we want to do it now?

1019
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:12,968
SAM: We're not near the entrance to the
tunnel right now.

1020
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:16,732
LAURA: No, let's just stealth it. Yeah, save
that.

1021
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:18,559
TALIESIN: We can save that for an emergency.

1022
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,734
MARISHA: I'll save it.

1023
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:24,572
MATT: Okay. It will take you, at the rate at which
it moves earth, it will take you probably a good

1024
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:26,190
hour to two hours to--

1025
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,398
MARISHA: To get to the tunnels?

1026
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:29,097
MATT: To get to any sort of system that he may be
referring to.

1027
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:31,064
MARISHA: All right, let's just walk. We'll walk
faster.

1028
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:37,147
MATT: All right, so, Garthok, I'm going to have
you roll a stealth check to move alongside the

1029
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:38,367
rest of the group.

1030
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:48,653
JASON: Great. 25.

1031
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:52,255
MARISHA: Does he benefit from Pass Without a
Trace?

1032
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:57,926
MATT: No, he arrived after the spell was cast, but
as you guys move forward, he also dives into the

1033
01:04:57,926 --> 01:05:03,810
shadows in a very similar way that you've seen Vax
do before. This orc definitely understands the

1034
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,969
resources of light and the absence of it.

1035
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,522
TALIESIN: He's played some Assassin's Creed.

1036
01:05:09,522 --> 01:05:14,147
MATT: (laughs) He's hitting you all up in the
shoulders for change. All right, so--

1037
01:05:14,147 --> 01:05:15,416
LIAM: Is that a dice game?

1038
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,879
TALIESIN: It's a band, they're very good.

1039
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:27,562
MATT: So, as you guys push forward, staying
towards the outskirts of the city, you do come

1040
01:05:27,562 --> 01:05:33,825
across, on the outer area of the Temple District,
a humble neighborhood that has been completely

1041
01:05:33,825 --> 01:05:40,526
reduced to cinders and ash. There is probably a
good eight to ten buildings that are piles of

1042
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:48,491
black, still burning wood, dust, and broken stone.
You can see on the outskirts of some of these

1043
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:54,663
piles of rubble, bodies lying in the street, the
skin charred black and cracked as the face and

1044
01:05:54,663 --> 01:06:01,195
arms are curled up in the final moments of
agony. You avert your gaze and continue pressing

1045
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:06,973
onward and you can see now, many of these large
temples in the center of the city, you can see

1046
01:06:06,973 --> 01:06:11,545
folks gathered to them and clustered on the
inside, you can hear people shouting and folks

1047
01:06:11,545 --> 01:06:20,314
trying to deal with this current circumstance
befalling the town. You continue to move out of

1048
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:25,685
the sight of those clusters of survivors that are
going to their various deities for aid and

1049
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:31,144
comfort. You push further towards the center of
the Temple District. You do catch out of the left

1050
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:37,729
the sound of breaking glass, specifically to you,
Vex, in the distance. As you glance over and look,

1051
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:42,824
you can see four individuals climb out of a window
with sacks over their shoulders. They all gesture

1052
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:47,877
to each other and go running off northward,
deeper into the city, carrying whatever goods they

1053
01:06:47,877 --> 01:06:54,627
managed to acquire from the interior. And as you
progress, you do notice a lot of windows have been

1054
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:59,948
broken. You don't know if from the inside or
outside. Some may have been from the impact of the

1055
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:02,922
attack, some may have been from individuals that
have been moving from building to building. It's

1056
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:10,293
hard to say at this point, there's such disarray
around you. As you skirt along the very far end of

1057
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:17,255
the Temple District, you see a portion of the
neighborhood now is in itself encased in ice, like

1058
01:07:17,255 --> 01:07:24,907
the individuals you saw at the south gate. This is
another area where Vorugal made its way through,

1059
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:32,684
and you can see another array of icy coffins of
other individuals who were trying to escape but

1060
01:07:32,684 --> 01:07:40,500
were locked in place. You can see a small group of
living Emon residents that are currently gathering

1061
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:45,422
the dead and trying to take them out of the open
and possibly give them a proper burial, whether it be

1062
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:51,338
people they know or not, but there is a look on
each of their faces of desolate acceptance of what

1063
01:07:51,338 --> 01:07:53,873
is happening and trying to process this--

1064
01:07:53,873 --> 01:08:02,352
TRAVIS: Can I slink back to Vax? And I say: you
still think that what was inside that skull is worse

1065
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:07,381
than all of this?

1066
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:15,749
LIAM: I think it is probably equal to this. We've
been burned before, Grog. This was going to happen

1067
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:18,295
whether we wanted it to or not.

1068
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:25,200
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we could have done something
about it. I walk on.

1069
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,513
MATT: Okay.

1070
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:28,853
LIAM: Big if, big man.

1071
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:35,146
MATT: The clouds are beginning to gather up over
the sky as you continue forward and the little bit

1072
01:08:35,146 --> 01:08:41,761
of sunshine that came through this morning is now
covered in coming rain clouds. Which may be a boon

1073
01:08:41,761 --> 01:08:47,322
to those buildings that still burn and possibly an
annoyance to a giant, fire-based red dragon in the

1074
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:53,731
center of the city but, nevertheless, the weather is quickly
shifting. As you begin pushing into Abdar's

1075
01:08:53,731 --> 01:09:01,665
Promenade, you can see the central bazaar before
you, the memory of it, this sprawling landscape of

1076
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:10,560
multicolored tents and carts and what was this
bustling marketplace is all closed down and a

1077
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,094
portion of it appears to have been torn through.
You can see broken bits of wood and wagon wheels

1078
01:09:16,094 --> 01:09:20,074
tossed asunder like, apparently, one of these
dragons may have smashed into the center and let

1079
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:29,032
loose its fury. You can see spatters of blood
across elements of the ground, but no sign of a

1080
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:34,743
body, as there are a few groups going around,
trying to gather what they can, but the place is

1081
01:09:34,743 --> 01:09:43,015
also picked clean. You notice a lot of these tents
and carts are empty of any real valuables. You are

1082
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:48,294
uncertain whether or not the proprietors took it
themselves or they have been picked clean by looters.

1083
01:09:48,294 --> 01:09:50,916
LAURA: Scavengers.

1084
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:58,690
MATT: You begin to approach, with a very, very
nervous heart, the corner of the bazaar that leads

1085
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:05,998
to Gilmore's place. As you approach, the
nervousness is met with the visual of a large

1086
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:14,369
stack of black smoke that rises from that
direction. As you push through with increased

1087
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:23,216
haste towards that area of the bazaar, you see
Gilmore's Glorious Goods, as well as two other

1088
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:31,158
adjacent buildings, completely destroyed. Piles of
rubble and what looks to be a group of about ten

1089
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:35,935
individuals that are currently picking through the
rubble and gathering what they can, moving over

1090
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,787
wood and brick.

1091
01:10:37,787 --> 01:10:41,975
LIAM: I stop stealthing and walk right into it and
start shouting, (shouting) get the fuck out of

1092
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:44,142
here! Get out!

1093
01:10:44,142 --> 01:10:49,335
MATT: As you do that, all of them turn over, looks
and one says, "Hey, get your own shit, all right?"

1094
01:10:49,335 --> 01:10:53,656
LIAM: Move on now! Now! Now!

1095
01:10:53,656 --> 01:10:57,934
MATT: He stops and looks about the other one. The
other guys looking over their shoulders and,

1096
01:10:57,934 --> 01:11:00,421
"Look, we're all just trying to stay alive here,
okay?"

1097
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:02,253
TALIESIN: I pull out my gun. You heard the man.

1098
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:03,728
TRAVIS: Yeah, big sword comes out, too.

1099
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:05,331
MARISHA: Fire hands.

1100
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:07,459
LAURA: Don't test us.

1101
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:10,416
MARISHA: We've had a really shitty day.

1102
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,954
MATT: "You've had a shitty day?"

1103
01:11:12,954 --> 01:11:15,791
MARISHA: We've all had a shitty day

1104
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:19,440
MATT: "Well, let's make it all sorts more shitty,"
And he pulls a shortsword from his side and all

1105
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,662
the rest of them pull their blades out and they
say, "Look, we saw this first. We're going to

1106
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:26,721
"bring it to him and save ourselves."

1107
01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:28,616
LIAM: I'll fucking gut you like a fish--

1108
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:29,492
LAURA: Stop!

1109
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:30,601
LIAM: --and take your innards--

1110
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:31,386
LAURA: Stop!

1111
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:32,751
LIAM: -- out your mouth. I will not!

1112
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:34,626
LAURA: Stop. You will take it to him?

1113
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:35,700
MARISHA: Who's him?

1114
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,975
LAURA: Thordak?

1115
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:43,410
MATT: They all, with their weapons out, tense
their shoulders and say, "There's only one way we

1116
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,876
"are going to survive this."

1117
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:53,859
LAURA: Listen. There's so much more available to
you, buildings up that way. Not worth your time

1118
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:55,089
right here.

1119
01:11:55,089 --> 01:11:59,403
MATT: (laughs) "Honey, we've already picked plenty
clean from this pile. This is our third time back."

1120
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:02,237
TRAVIS: It'll be your last time back if you're not
careful.

1121
01:12:02,237 --> 01:12:07,446
LAURA: Is it worth your death? Bringing this to
him, is it worth your death? Because you will die here.

1122
01:12:07,446 --> 01:12:11,420
MATT: "You know what, I think I stand a better
chance against the lot of you than with that thing."

1123
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,599
MARISHA: You just thought wrong.

1124
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:18,929
LAURA: Step on and go find loot somewhere else. At
least then you can present it to him and not die

1125
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:21,027
here. Don't be stupid.

1126
01:12:21,027 --> 01:12:22,328
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1127
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:24,044
TRAVIS: Vex, please let me off the chain.

1128
01:12:24,044 --> 01:12:29,163
LAURA: Ugh, I rolled so poorly. Anybody want to
assist me?

1129
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:30,815
MATT: It's a little late for that.

1130
01:12:30,815 --> 01:12:33,944
LAURA: (sings) How about ten?

1131
01:12:33,944 --> 01:12:43,612
MATT: Okay. You can see as he's holding his
shortsword to the side, goes, "You know, you may

1132
01:12:43,612 --> 01:12:49,723
"be stupid, but there are other stupid things in
this town, like walking in the middle of an

1133
01:12:49,723 --> 01:12:51,038
"ambush, dear."

1134
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:54,248
At which point, a dagger comes past--

1135
01:12:54,248 --> 01:12:55,994
LAURA: I've got passive perception!

1136
01:12:55,994 --> 01:12:56,899
MATT: I know.

1137
01:12:56,899 --> 01:12:58,852
LAURA: Motherfuck!

1138
01:12:58,852 --> 01:13:04,851
MATT: You instinctually move your head out the way
as it (whoosh) past you as you see another

1139
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:09,427
individual that was keeping low to the rubble
flung a dagger at you, and the rest of them pull

1140
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,967
their weapons ready and are about to enter a fray.
I need everyone to roll initiative.

1141
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:15,053
MARISHA: Fuck these assholes!

1142
01:13:15,053 --> 01:13:17,161
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

1143
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:18,527
LAURA: Natural fucking 20.

1144
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,688
MARISHA: Therapeutic ass-kicking. That's pretty
good.

1145
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,181
SAM: They may win.

1146
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:27,259
MARISHA: Nah. Fuck that. We're way more pissed
off--

1147
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:28,784
SAM: They work for a dragon.

1148
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:32,955
LAURA: Do they? They're just looters.

1149
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:35,471
TALIESIN: This is going to feel really good.

1150
01:13:35,471 --> 01:13:36,521
MARISHA: Yeah.

1151
01:13:36,521 --> 01:13:38,292
SAM: But they're innocent.

1152
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:41,409
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not going to kill them. We'll
just beat their faces in.

1153
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:45,819
LAURA: Garthok, did you lead us here? Did you know
about this?

1154
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:47,174
JASON: No.

1155
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:48,608
SAM: I believe him.

1156
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:50,899
MARISHA: Insight check. Can I insight check him?

1157
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:55,629
TALIESIN: We literally just walked to where we
were going. He lead us precisely where we wanted

1158
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:58,951
to go. There's nothing clever about that trap.

1159
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:04,199
MATT: All right, so, placement, guys. Where would
you like to be on this one?

1160
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:11,612
TALIESIN: I suppose we'd be hanging back a bit.
Well, you got up in their face, so you're--

1161
01:14:11,612 --> 01:14:13,251
MARISHA: The three of us got up in their face.

1162
01:14:13,251 --> 01:14:14,559
TRAVIS: I was walking with Vax.

1163
01:14:14,559 --> 01:14:16,565
TALIESIN: I was hanging back a bit.

1164
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,890
MARISHA: I think Scanlan and Pike were towards the
back.

1165
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:22,584
I'm next to Percy.

1166
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:27,134
MATT: And Vex, you're up here?

1167
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:28,618
LAURA: Sure, why not.

1168
01:14:28,618 --> 01:14:30,188
MATT: You were up in their face right here.

1169
01:14:30,188 --> 01:14:32,296
LAURA: In his face and I have Trinket on my back.

1170
01:14:32,296 --> 01:14:34,329
SAM: Which one is Jason Charles Miller?

1171
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:36,926
MATT: Jason is--

1172
01:14:36,926 --> 01:14:39,060
TALIESIN: Gart-Garthluk.

1173
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,367
JASON: Garthok.

1174
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:43,069
TALIESIN: Garthok, Garthok, I'm close. I'm getting
it, Garthok.

1175
01:14:43,069 --> 01:14:48,083
MATT: Garthok, where do you want to be?

1176
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,452
JASON: I'm ready to tangle.

1177
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:56,518
MATT: All right, we'll put you over here, in the
middle of the group being watched. The rest of

1178
01:14:56,518 --> 01:15:00,752
these thugs are all currently sitting over in this
rubble.

1179
01:15:00,752 --> 01:15:06,386
MARISHA: What do you think, Garthok? I don't know,
what do you think, Waynethok?

1180
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:10,631
JASON: (laughs) Party on, Garthok. Party on,
Waynethok.

1181
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:14,148
(laughter)

1182
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:24,529
MATT: All right. So, I would like--

1183
01:15:24,529 --> 01:15:29,041
SAM: Should we be at all concerned about drawing
attention to ourselves?

1184
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,579
LAURA: Too late for that.

1185
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:33,027
SAM: No, I mean, like, giant Fireballs or
anything?

1186
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:35,530
LAURA: Probably stay away from huge magical
effects.

1187
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:39,492
LIAM: Fireball straight into the sky!

1188
01:15:39,492 --> 01:15:47,580
MATT: Yeah, there you go, that'd be perfect. All
right, so, initiatives 25 to 20 or higher?

1189
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,378
LAURA: 27. Natural 20.

1190
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,161
SAM: Natural 27.

1191
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:52,979
TALIESIN: 25.

1192
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,904
MATT: Percy. 20 to 15?

1193
01:15:57,904 --> 01:15:59,457
MARISHA: 17.

1194
01:15:59,457 --> 01:16:07,313
MATT: Keyleth. All right, 15 to ten? What do we
got?

1195
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,334
JASON: 14.

1196
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:09,177
SAM: 12.

1197
01:16:09,177 --> 01:16:09,997
LIAM: 12.

1198
01:16:09,997 --> 01:16:10,999
TRAVIS: 14.

1199
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,254
MATT: All right, so we got--

1200
01:16:12,254 --> 01:16:13,781
TRAVIS: Two 12s and two 14s.

1201
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:25,565
MATT: And then 12 and 12. All righty. And is Pike
not able to--

1202
01:16:25,565 --> 01:16:27,526
LIAM: I'll try!

1203
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:30,365
LAURA: Pike lost completely all connection.

1204
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:31,966
SAM: Pike fell down in some rubble.

1205
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:36,079
MATT: I'll roll for her. (laughs) Pike's going
last. I figure she probably would have rolled last

1206
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:37,767
anyways, so Pike is last.

1207
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:41,741
LAURA: Yeah, I think she said she was probably
going to have to leave until the break until we

1208
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:43,135
can figure out the tech.

1209
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,855
MATT: Gotcha! Okay, no worries. Top of the round.
Vex, since you are the one who got the first

1210
01:16:46,855 --> 01:16:49,324
attack and immediately reacting to it. You're up.
What are you doing?

1211
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:53,777
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on
that motherfucker in front of me. And then I'm

1212
01:16:53,777 --> 01:17:01,858
going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of them in
front of me, like a big cone effect.

1213
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:08,797
MATT: Okay. Okay, so, Conjure Barrage is your
action, so that's your full thing. So, at which

1214
01:17:08,797 --> 01:17:09,888
direction are you doing it?

1215
01:17:09,888 --> 01:17:14,502
LAURA: Just towards all the guys in front of me. I
want to get as many in the cone as I can.

1216
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:17,800
MATT: Okay, you probably need to move this way or
else you're going to hit your brother as well.

1217
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,013
LAURA: Oh, that's my brother.

1218
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:19,988
MATT: That's your brother right there.

1219
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:22,731
LAURA: I can see what's happening now. Yeah, I
move over then I--

1220
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:23,891
MATT: That's a 60 foot?

1221
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:25,791
LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone.

1222
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:31,683
MATT: Yeah, right there. So all four of them are
affected. Great.

1223
01:17:31,683 --> 01:17:35,142
LAURA: Great. So, Trinket is still on my back.
He's a red panda.

1224
01:17:35,142 --> 01:17:39,223
MATT: Yeah. Until she breaks concentration.

1225
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:47,611
LAURA: I fire it and I shoot forward and that's
it, huh? I don't have to, like--

1226
01:17:47,611 --> 01:17:51,363
MATT: Conjure Barrage, you roll damage and they
get to save.

1227
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:58,506
LAURA: Okay, cool. So I'm going to cast that at--
oh, it's already at third level, okay.

1228
01:17:58,506 --> 01:17:59,749
MATT: Yeah.

1229
01:17:59,749 --> 01:18:09,410
LAURA: Whoa. 15? And then I add my type anything?
Or it's just 15.

1230
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:16,926
MATT: It's just 15, and then you add 1d6 for the
one dude for Hunter's Mark.

1231
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:20,215
LAURA: For my Hunter's Mark. Do I add my Bracers
of Archery, though, on that?

1232
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:27,379
MATT: Technically-- You know what, sure. Because
it is technically a ranged attack. I'll let it

1233
01:18:27,379 --> 01:18:28,670
happen, sure.

1234
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,686
LAURA: 17 and an additional six on--

1235
01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:32,994
MATT: On that guy? Okay, what's your DC of your
spells?

1236
01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:34,852
LAURA: 15.

1237
01:18:34,852 --> 01:18:36,331
MATT: Okay.

1238
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:38,963
LAURA: Do I add my spell attack bonus?

1239
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:43,559
MATT: You don't have to roll to attack. This just
happens and they have to try and save to get out

1240
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:44,606
of the way.

1241
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:45,720
LAURA: I understand.

1242
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,957
MATT: Cool. All right so, that's 17 damage to--
those two take half there.

1243
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,375
LAURA: I don't understand.

1244
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,998
LIAM: It will sink in in a few episodes. It's fine.

1245
01:18:52,998 --> 01:19:01,280
MATT: All right. Cool. All right so, as you
release this spraying torrent of arrows down the

1246
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,707
way. It fires outward. All of them all of a sudden
have to put their arms up to instinctually defend

1247
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:12,215
themselves with arrows piercing bits of their
armor and ricochet off. It's not horribly

1248
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:16,346
damaging, but enough to sweep into all of them and
they all immediately look up angrily at each other,

1249
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:19,317
weapons at the ready to go ahead and
get vengeance.

1250
01:19:19,317 --> 01:19:21,644
LAURA: I take the rest of my moment to back up
against a wall.

1251
01:19:21,644 --> 01:19:26,124
MATT: Okay. Right there. All righty, Percy, you're
up next.

1252
01:19:26,124 --> 01:19:33,930
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to Hex the one that
she Hunter's Marked.

1253
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:35,816
MATT: Oh man.

1254
01:19:35,816 --> 01:19:37,577
LAURA: Fuck that guy.

1255
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,707
MATT: All righty.

1256
01:19:39,707 --> 01:19:42,091
MARISHA: (laughs) Fuck that one guy in
particular.

1257
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:54,685
TALIESIN: And I'm going to-- Where am I? Oh, there
I am. I'm going to run towards that other wall to

1258
01:19:54,685 --> 01:19:55,797
the left.

1259
01:19:55,797 --> 01:19:56,679
MATT: This way?

1260
01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:02,388
TALIESIN: Yep, all the while taking a few shots at
that bastard who I just hexed.

1261
01:20:02,388 --> 01:20:05,596
MATT: As you are moving you're like (gunshots).
Okay. Go for it.

1262
01:20:05,596 --> 01:20:14,229
TALIESIN: Oh, and Sharpshooter shots, because
that's funnier. So that's, ugh--

1263
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:16,166
MARISHA: But you're Percy.

1264
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:22,577
TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's not-- That's 14 to hit.

1265
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:26,186
MATT: 14 hits.

1266
01:20:26,186 --> 01:20:27,879
TALIESIN: Should I just roll all three shots?

1267
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:29,787
MATT: Yeah, roll three shots.

1268
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:32,572
TALIESIN: That's 20. That hits.

1269
01:20:32,572 --> 01:20:34,282
MATT: That hits.

1270
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:36,961
TALIESIN: And 18. That hits.

1271
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:44,123
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and roll damage for all
three shots, and an additional 1d6 to each shot.

1272
01:20:44,123 --> 01:20:57,941
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's ten, 26, 27 points. 26
points plus one necrotic. That's on the other end

1273
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:58,935
of things.

1274
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:01,610
MARISHA: The opposite! (laughs) The exact
opposite.

1275
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:05,990
TALIESIN: Irony. 17 points plus six
necrotic.

1276
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,997
MATT: All righty.

1277
01:21:06,997 --> 01:21:16,641
TALIESIN: And for my final roll. 17, 18, 19, 20,
25 points plus six necrotic.

1278
01:21:16,641 --> 01:21:18,509
MARISHA: That guy is dead, right?

1279
01:21:18,509 --> 01:21:26,869
MATT: All right so, as you go running by
(gunshots) each shot as it impacts, the guy who's

1280
01:21:26,869 --> 01:21:32,037
already dealing with the array of arrows in his
chest, each shot that blows across his shoulders

1281
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:38,348
is followed by a plume of black-purple smoke that
blasts off each impact until it leaves a hole off

1282
01:21:38,348 --> 01:21:44,525
this shoulder. This actually blows this arm off
from the impact. And the third one just destroys

1283
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,176
the upper part of his head and he slinks back onto
the rubble.

1284
01:21:47,176 --> 01:21:51,285
TALIESIN: I move my Hex to the next guy and point
at him as I'm running.

1285
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:53,971
LAURA: I move my Hunter's Mark to the next guy
because the other one went to zero.

1286
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:55,576
TRAVIS: That's some Hateful Eight shit right
there.

1287
01:21:55,576 --> 01:22:02,297
MATT: (laughs) All right, you have to use a
bonus action to mark a new creature. Both you guys do.

1288
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:03,387
LAURA: Oh.

1289
01:22:03,387 --> 01:22:07,428
MATT: So those will be-- Those move over when--
(gunshot impact) He is blown off the map

1290
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:08,699
essentially.

1291
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,795
LAURA: It said when it went down to zero, I could
move it to the next person.

1292
01:22:11,795 --> 01:22:15,128
MATT: If the target drops to zero hit
points, you can use a bonus action on subsequent

1293
01:22:15,128 --> 01:22:16,665
turns of yours to mark a new creature.

1294
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:17,790
LAURA: I understand.

1295
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,040
MATT: I know.

1296
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,667
LIAM: There's so many rules, guys!

1297
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:27,440
MATT: All right, it's their turn now. So, out the
side, after that final shot, you hear a little

1298
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:34,489
guttural grunt off to your left as you see this
dwarf with a giant hammer come rushing up. "You!

1299
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:40,894
"How dare you!" And comes swinging off towards your
direction there, off to the side. These guys here

1300
01:22:40,894 --> 01:22:47,172
are going to move in. Both of these are going to
run up to Grog, being the larger there.

1301
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,594
TRAVIS: Just signed your death certificate.

1302
01:22:49,594 --> 01:22:52,638
MATT: That guy comes up to Keyleth. These two come
rushing around.

1303
01:22:52,638 --> 01:22:54,559
LAURA: Oh shit, there's two more?

1304
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:55,524
MATT: Yep.

1305
01:22:55,524 --> 01:22:56,844
LAURA: I didn't see those guys.

1306
01:22:56,844 --> 01:22:57,973
MATT: No, you didn't.

1307
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,272
LAURA: I saw one of them, but I didn't see all of
them.

1308
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:02,912
MATT: That guy can only get that far, so he's
going to go ahead and throw. All right, so--

1309
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:04,636
LAURA: They're going to get sneak attacks on me.

1310
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:09,373
MATT: Indeed. All right, so, first and foremost,
the dwarf comes up against you, Percy. That's

1311
01:23:09,373 --> 01:23:13,142
going to be an 18 to hit.

1312
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:15,197
TALIESIN: My armor class is 18.

1313
01:23:15,197 --> 01:23:20,912
MATT: So it hits, yeah. And it's going to hit you
again this time. That's going to be 15, so only--

1314
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:28,229
TALIESIN: I was about to say, can I take that first
18 and make it-- nah, you know what, I'll take the

1315
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:29,886
hit, never mind.

1316
01:23:29,886 --> 01:23:33,242
MATT: Okay. You take eight points of bludgeoning
damage from the smack of the mace.

1317
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:37,834
TALIESIN: Okay.

1318
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:38,968
MATT: All right.

1319
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:40,674
LIAM: Slap-a the mace.

1320
01:23:40,674 --> 01:23:49,379
MATT: Two guys against Grog now, their maces out
as well. Because they have pack tactics, they both

1321
01:23:49,379 --> 01:23:55,795
have advantage on attacks against you. So with
that, that's a 19.

1322
01:23:55,795 --> 01:23:57,198
TRAVIS: Hits.

1323
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,688
MATT: Hits. And the other one, with advantage, is
a natural 20.

1324
01:23:59,688 --> 01:24:01,118
MARISHA: Ouch.

1325
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:08,922
MATT: You're not raging yet, so you take full
damage. All right, ten points of bludgeoning

1326
01:24:08,922 --> 01:24:16,997
damage on the first hit. And the second one,
that's going to be 15 points of bludgeoning

1327
01:24:16,997 --> 01:24:21,301
damage. So a total of 25 points of bludgeoning
damage as both of them whack you with maces from

1328
01:24:21,301 --> 01:24:26,492
each side, with the first round of attacks. Now
the second round of attacks, because they attack twice.

1329
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:27,911
LAURA: Ugh.

1330
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:30,895
MATT: With advantage. That's a 21, which hits.

1331
01:24:30,895 --> 01:24:31,940
TRAVIS: Yep.

1332
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,919
MATT: And a 15.

1333
01:24:33,919 --> 01:24:34,828
TRAVIS: Nope.

1334
01:24:34,828 --> 01:24:38,231
MATT: So you then take seven points of bludgeoning
damage after that.

1335
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:39,193
TRAVIS: Yep.

1336
01:24:39,193 --> 01:24:45,757
MATT: Cool. So that's two. There's one against
you, Vax. He doesn't get advantage against you. He

1337
01:24:45,757 --> 01:24:47,003
rolls a 17.

1338
01:24:47,003 --> 01:24:53,428
LIAM: I'm going to use Uncanny Dodge-- No! It
doesn't hit because I've got both daggers out.

1339
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:55,801
MATT: Oh yeah, because you get bonus AC.

1340
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:59,427
LIAM: I have three armor classes depending on if
my boots are on or my daggers are in my hands.

1341
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:06,453
MATT: Right. Okay, cool. Good to know. All right,
so then leading up to that, there's one against

1342
01:25:06,453 --> 01:25:07,712
you, Keyleth.

1343
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,985
MARISHA: Yeah.

1344
01:25:08,985 --> 01:25:19,351
MATT: That's going to be a 14 and a natural 20.
That is going to be 15 points of bludgeoning

1345
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:20,609
damage against you.

1346
01:25:20,609 --> 01:25:21,639
MARISHA: All right.

1347
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:25,468
MATT: Whack! As the mace swings past and catches
you right across the chin, the impact causes your

1348
01:25:25,468 --> 01:25:29,313
head to snap for a second. A very minor moment of
whiplash, as you look back and feel the blood

1349
01:25:29,313 --> 01:25:30,665
trickling down.

1350
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,880
MARISHA: Ah!

1351
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:40,300
MATT: Yeah, and then there's two against you, Vex.
Which both get advantage because of pack tactics.

1352
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:55,751
13, even with advantage. The second attack is 23,
and the other one does two attacks, 22 and 17.

1353
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:59,418
17 doesn't hit? Okay, so that's three attacks on
you that hit.

1354
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:00,681
LAURA: No, two attacks hit.

1355
01:26:00,681 --> 01:26:10,074
MATT: Oh, two attacks. You take nine points of
bludgeoning damage and six points of bludgeoning

1356
01:26:10,074 --> 01:26:11,162
damage.

1357
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:12,408
LAURA: Okay!

1358
01:26:12,408 --> 01:26:17,289
MATT: And the one that's over here, there's nobody 
immediately around for it pull its mace out. Instead,

1359
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:21,624
he pulls out his heavy crossbow, lines up, and
aims at you, Scanlan.

1360
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:23,350
SAM: Oh, what? Who, me?

1361
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,266
MATT: Yep.

1362
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:25,622
SAM: But I'm-- Oh.

1363
01:26:25,622 --> 01:26:28,065
MATT: And that is 21 to hit.

1364
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:29,021
SAM: That hits.

1365
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:38,813
MATT: You then suffer ten points of piercing
damage as the heavy crossbow bolt sinks

1366
01:26:38,813 --> 01:26:42,640
itself into your shoulder and the armor takes the
brunt of it but you can still feel the pain of it

1367
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,431
piercing just about an inch through.

1368
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:45,611
SAM: Damn it.

1369
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:48,273
MATT: That ends their go. Next up, we have
Keyleth.

1370
01:26:48,273 --> 01:26:53,520
MARISHA: All right, I'm really pissed off at this
guy who just decked me in the face. So I'm going

1371
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,126
to cast Call Lightning.

1372
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,346
MATT: All righty.

1373
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:06,974
MARISHA: And can I reach out and, the guy who hit
me, can I reach out and grab him and call it right

1374
01:27:06,974 --> 01:27:11,005
into him?

1375
01:27:11,005 --> 01:27:12,830
TRAVIS: Like conductor-style.

1376
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:16,589
MARISHA: Yeah. Just grab his face after he just
punched me.

1377
01:27:16,589 --> 01:27:23,313
MATT: Okay. So, the minute you do that, the
Polymorph fades and Trinket turns into a full bear.

1378
01:27:23,313 --> 01:27:31,584
MARISHA: Dope! Even cooler! Totally meant to do
that.

1379
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,836
MATT: You can, but know wherever the bolt hits,
it's everything in a five-foot area. So you can

1380
01:27:34,836 --> 01:27:36,289
hit the bolt behind him--

1381
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:37,540
MARISHA: Nah, I want to--

1382
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,525
MATT: You want to take it?

1383
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:39,463
MARISHA: I want to take it.

1384
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:40,293
MATT: All right.

1385
01:27:40,293 --> 01:27:41,596
MARISHA: I'm pissed the <i>fuck</i> off.

1386
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:44,692
MATT: So, as you put your hands up, the clouds
that are already forming from the storm--

1387
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:46,008
MARISHA: I was going to say, I get extra damage,
right?

1388
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:49,590
MATT: Yeah. They begin to grow darker and directly
above you and as you bring your hands up, your

1389
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:55,649
flames slowly drifting off your fingertips, you
bring your hand down, and as you do, a bolt of

1390
01:27:55,649 --> 01:27:58,892
lightning comes streaking out of the sky, blasting
right into the guy in front of you. Go ahead and

1391
01:27:58,892 --> 01:28:00,002
roll damage.

1392
01:28:00,002 --> 01:28:02,762
MARISHA: Is it four? Do I get an extra d10? Is
that what I get, or--

1393
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:07,156
MATT: You get an additional d10, yes. 4d10
lightning damage.

1394
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:11,390
MARISHA: Do I get anything extra because I'm
holding on to him? Because I'm channeling it?

1395
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,557
MATT: I'll say no, that's more--

1396
01:28:13,557 --> 01:28:14,922
TALIESIN: Fire damage?

1397
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:19,327
MATT: No, that would be a different attack,
unfortunately. You're holding him and the flames

1398
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:24,008
are licking up into his face. So it's a scary
visual.

1399
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:26,116
MARISHA: 25 points.

1400
01:28:26,116 --> 01:28:30,756
MATT: 25 points of damage. He did not make the
save, I believe. Rolled a 15. What's your DC on

1401
01:28:30,756 --> 01:28:32,114
that spell?

1402
01:28:32,114 --> 01:28:33,160
MARISHA: 18.

1403
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,945
MATT: Yeah. So the bolt comes down and I need you
to go ahead and make a save against your own spell.

1404
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:43,241
MARISHA: Yep. Failed.

1405
01:28:43,241 --> 01:28:45,240
MATT: Okay, so you also take that damage.

1406
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,429
MARISHA: Yep.

1407
01:28:46,429 --> 01:28:48,169
MATT: But it was cool.

1408
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:51,465
MARISHA: I use my bonus action to go Minxie.

1409
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:57,326
LAURA: Whoa, I like it! We ain't seen Minxie in
a while.

1410
01:28:57,326 --> 01:29:02,433
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while.

1411
01:29:02,433 --> 01:29:03,574
LAURA: Nice!

1412
01:29:03,574 --> 01:29:07,805
MATT: As the guy's looking, reeling from the
impact of the blast, he pulls away, smoke coming

1413
01:29:07,805 --> 01:29:15,170
off his chest. He gets his mace ready as he looks
up and sees you change into this giant white

1414
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:16,616
sabretooth tiger with these claws--

1415
01:29:16,616 --> 01:29:18,766
MARISHA: I get a little bit of foam going, you know.

1416
01:29:18,766 --> 01:29:22,529
LAURA: I like that right before it he saw a giant
bear appear.

1417
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:24,222
(laughter)

1418
01:29:24,222 --> 01:29:26,247
MATT: Yeah, it just got somehow weirder.

1419
01:29:26,247 --> 01:29:28,160
MARISHA: This means I can finally use my gift from
Mary!

1420
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:36,288
MATT: All right. That ends Keyleh's turn. Garthok,
you're up.

1421
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:42,915
JASON: Great, I move over and take that one on--

1422
01:29:42,915 --> 01:29:44,246
MATT: Over here?

1423
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:52,497
JASON: Keep going straight. No, no, the other way.
No. Okay now. Sorry. Yes. No, wait, okay, I was

1424
01:29:52,497 --> 01:29:53,639
going to go to--

1425
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,111
MATT: You have laser pointers at the table.

1426
01:29:55,111 --> 01:29:56,281
SAM: Someone give him a laser pointer.

1427
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:58,760
MARISHA: Sorry, I had it and I was distracted.

1428
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,653
JASON: There.

1429
01:30:01,653 --> 01:30:04,395
MATT: Oh, right here? Got you, okay. So you rush
up to there.

1430
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:09,982
JASON: And I flank. Since they're engaged, can I
use my sneak attack?

1431
01:30:09,982 --> 01:30:15,148
MATT: Yeah, if you hit, you hit with the sneak
attack. So as you rush out very quickly, you see

1432
01:30:15,148 --> 01:30:21,649
he pulls out a spear, like a short spear, but it's
curved kris-like at the blade and it's smaller

1433
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:26,792
than most short spears you've seen. It's a custom
piece of work. And he slides up and attempts to

1434
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:28,746
jam it into the thug in front of you.

1435
01:30:28,746 --> 01:30:31,261
LIAM and LAURA: Get it!

1436
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:34,094
JASON: 15.

1437
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:36,379
MATT: 15 hits. Go ahead and roll damage and sneak
attack damage.

1438
01:30:36,379 --> 01:30:45,115
JASON: Hell yeah. So, let's see, I need some more
d6s. Do you want me to do the sneak attack damage

1439
01:30:45,115 --> 01:30:48,172
first or the weapon damage first, or add it all at
the end?

1440
01:30:48,172 --> 01:30:50,916
MATT: Just add it all together and then add your
modifier at the end.

1441
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:58,266
MARISHA: Grr. I'm so excited.

1442
01:30:58,266 --> 01:30:59,976
MATT: Grog, you're on deck, so be ready.

1443
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:02,062
MARISHA: This is what life is about, you guys.

1444
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:06,592
MATT: This was the night Marisha took somebody's
eyes out.

1445
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:07,832
MARISHA: (laughs) I know, I know.

1446
01:31:07,832 --> 01:31:09,523
JASON: 28.

1447
01:31:09,523 --> 01:31:17,055
MATT: 28 points of damage. Nice! All righty. So,
as the spear easily pierces past armor and you can

1448
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:22,536
see the haggard-looking woman then looks over and
the spear itself is stuck in her midsection. As

1449
01:31:22,536 --> 01:31:26,997
you withdraw it, you can see a gout of blood pour
out afterward of the wound itself, leaving behind

1450
01:31:26,997 --> 01:31:28,444
a pretty nasty--

1451
01:31:28,444 --> 01:31:31,854
JASON: My eyes widen in battle-lust.

1452
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:33,654
(laughter)

1453
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:37,450
MATT: Orc jaw quivers, the teeth exposed. Okay, is
that your turn?

1454
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,439
JASON: Yes.

1455
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:40,583
MATT: Okay, you still have a bonus action if you
wanted to disengage.

1456
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:44,949
JASON: Oh, yeah. So I can disengage without 
attack of opportunity?

1457
01:31:44,949 --> 01:31:51,056
MATT: If you use disengage and then move past. You
moved three spaces. You can disengage and move

1458
01:31:51,056 --> 01:31:56,266
back four more spaces if you want to, with your
speed. Your call. Or you can stay there and lock

1459
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:57,584
him in place.

1460
01:31:57,584 --> 01:31:58,592
JASON: You know what? I'm going to stay.

1461
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,858
MATT: Okay, cool. Grog, you're up.

1462
01:31:59,858 --> 01:32:06,015
TRAVIS: After taking a few hits from the
sacrificial lamb that stands between Vax and I, I

1463
01:32:06,015 --> 01:32:12,044
unsheathe Craven Edge, feeling the goosebumps rush
up my skin, and I look down at him and say, please

1464
01:32:12,044 --> 01:32:18,350
run. And I draw the blade across my hand and I go
into a frenzied rage.

1465
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:20,338
(laughter)

1466
01:32:20,338 --> 01:32:26,037
MATT: All righty. At which point, the blood
touching the blade, it curves down the obsidian

1467
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:30,800
and then sinks into the actual weapon. It doesn't
even have a moment to drip before the blade seems

1468
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,634
to absorb the blood that you put on it.

1469
01:32:32,634 --> 01:32:41,056
TRAVIS: We're bonded. It's a match made in heaven.
I would also like to use reckless attack as I take

1470
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,397
my three attacks at this piece of shit.

1471
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:45,978
MATT: Well, it's a bonus action to rage, so you
get two attacks this turn.

1472
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,008
TRAVIS: Two attacks this turn.

1473
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:50,094
MATT: Yeah. Reckless attack it up, man.

1474
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:52,108
TRAVIS: That is a 19.

1475
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:54,701
MATT: That hits. These are Great Weapon Master?

1476
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:58,410
TRAVIS: Yes. And that is-- not great, that's 11.

1477
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:02,752
MATT: 11 still hits. These guys aren't very
well-armored.

1478
01:33:02,752 --> 01:33:06,736
LAURA: Loser! Loser with your 11 AC!

1479
01:33:06,736 --> 01:33:11,812
TRAVIS: That's a 22 for the first one.

1480
01:33:11,812 --> 01:33:13,198
MATT: Okay.

1481
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:18,676
TRAVIS: 19 on the second one.

1482
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,059
MATT: Okay.

1483
01:33:20,059 --> 01:33:22,907
TRAVIS: And they both have to make the DC saving
throw.

1484
01:33:22,907 --> 01:33:24,467
MATT: Both against the same individual?

1485
01:33:24,467 --> 01:33:25,776
TRAVIS: Yeah, same guy.

1486
01:33:25,776 --> 01:33:32,844
MATT: Makes the first save with a 19. Fails the
second one. So the first strike streaks across.

1487
01:33:32,844 --> 01:33:39,588
You can see it cuts a huge gash across the upper
body as the burly-looking looter glances back at

1488
01:33:39,588 --> 01:33:45,060
you (heavy breathing). Brings up a shortsword and
is about to go in for the pierce, at which point

1489
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:50,319
you kick her away from you about a foot and draw
the blade around, and this time you run the blade

1490
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:55,977
right into her torso, piercing her through. As she
looks up at you, you can see her skin go pale as

1491
01:33:55,977 --> 01:34:00,127
her strength is drawn into the blade. You get to
add a point to your strength.

1492
01:34:00,127 --> 01:34:02,549
LAURA: What! How long does that last?

1493
01:34:02,549 --> 01:34:04,437
MATT: That lasts until your next short rest.

1494
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:06,679
LAURA: Don't rest ever!

1495
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:09,670
(laughter)

1496
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,940
MATT: So yeah, your strength's now 18, so add plus
one to your attack damage going forward.

1497
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,288
TRAVIS: Plus one to damage?

1498
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:20,567
MATT: Yeah. To hit and damage with your attacks.
But you pull the blade out and she crumples to the ground.

1499
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:24,447
LAURA: So for every person you hit, it makes it
better and better and better!

1500
01:34:24,447 --> 01:34:28,926
TRAVIS: Can I look over my shoulder to the guy on
the left and like, you're next!

1501
01:34:28,926 --> 01:34:36,052
MATT: You very much can. You can see the
visual of this presentation seems to have

1502
01:34:36,052 --> 01:34:39,615
shaken their resolve, though not enough to the
point where they're backing down yet. The

1503
01:34:39,615 --> 01:34:43,105
desperation kicks in. All right, that ends your
turn, Grog? You're staying there?

1504
01:34:43,105 --> 01:34:44,357
TRAVIS: I'll stay there.

1505
01:34:44,357 --> 01:34:45,814
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

1506
01:34:45,814 --> 01:34:48,230
SAM: Okay, so the guy next to Percy is the dwarf?

1507
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,340
MATT: Correct.

1508
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:55,501
SAM: Okay. I will hand-cone it up and I will cast
Dominate Person on him.

1509
01:34:55,501 --> 01:34:57,214
MATT: (laughs) Okay!

1510
01:34:57,214 --> 01:34:59,947
SAM: And I will try to bend him to my will.

1511
01:34:59,947 --> 01:35:01,562
MATT: That is a failed save and a half.

1512
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:03,098
SAM: Okay, good.

1513
01:35:03,098 --> 01:35:09,926
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, we'll
use the blue one. So, yeah. As a bonus action each

1514
01:35:09,926 --> 01:35:12,006
turn, you can basically tell him what to do.

1515
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:18,143
SAM: Okay. I will tell him to walk over to me and
start emptying his pockets of anything he's

1516
01:35:18,143 --> 01:35:19,910
looted. Straight-up.

1517
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,553
(laughter)

1518
01:35:21,553 --> 01:35:26,139
MATT: The dwarf's face goes limp and drops the
mace on the ground and looks over towards you, the

1519
01:35:26,139 --> 01:35:31,411
eyes glazed over, and goes, "Certainly, Master. It
would be my pleasure." And begins to rifle through

1520
01:35:31,411 --> 01:35:34,101
the pockets. Okay. You want to move anywhere or
you staying where you are?

1521
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:36,129
SAM: No, I'll stay there to accept my treasure.

1522
01:35:36,129 --> 01:35:38,694
(laughter)

1523
01:35:38,694 --> 01:35:40,515
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

1524
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:45,531
LIAM: Okay, so, I'm going to take the Dagger of
Life-Stealing and I'm going to stab the person

1525
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:51,065
closer to you, yeah? So that's a 23.

1526
01:35:51,065 --> 01:35:52,147
MATT: Hits.

1527
01:35:52,147 --> 01:36:04,268
LIAM: So we'll do that first. That is 11. No,
that's ten. Ten. And then I'm going to use

1528
01:36:04,268 --> 01:36:10,246
disengage as my bonus action and I'm going to
pivot, roll around Grog along the south side of

1529
01:36:10,246 --> 01:36:16,224
him, and spin around and stick the Keen Dagger
into the neck of the guy behind him. I'm going to

1530
01:36:16,224 --> 01:36:20,545
use Luck. That's better. And that is 24.

1531
01:36:20,545 --> 01:36:22,337
MATT: All righty. That hits.

1532
01:36:22,337 --> 01:36:27,165
LIAM: That's sneak attack. 11 plus this.

1533
01:36:27,165 --> 01:36:30,073
MATT: So wait, this is with your-- did you click
your Boots of Haste on this?

1534
01:36:30,073 --> 01:36:31,709
LIAM: No. So two attacks?

1535
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:35,179
MATT: You get two attacks, but you used your bonus
action to disengage, which would've been your

1536
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:36,525
second attack, so you wouldn't get--

1537
01:36:36,525 --> 01:36:38,103
LIAM: Oh, then I'm out. All right, I'm out.

1538
01:36:38,103 --> 01:36:39,402
MATT: Okay. So you move over there?

1539
01:36:39,402 --> 01:36:45,037
LIAM: Yeah, I'll use disengage and I'm going to
back up against Grog.

1540
01:36:45,037 --> 01:36:50,603
MATT: Okay, right there? All right. You're still
in combat with that person.

1541
01:36:50,603 --> 01:36:51,994
LIAM: Back-to-back with the big man.

1542
01:36:51,994 --> 01:36:53,461
MATT: Great, so you guys are like back-to-back
right now, looking around.

1543
01:36:53,461 --> 01:36:55,470
LAURA: Awesome. Look at you buddies!

1544
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:56,603
LIAM: Uh, not really.

1545
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:59,146
MATT: Pike, your turn!

1546
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,845
ASHLEY: Okay, does anybody need healing?

1547
01:37:01,845 --> 01:37:02,853
LAURA: Not yet!

1548
01:37:02,853 --> 01:37:04,686
TRAVIS: Fuck somebody up.

1549
01:37:04,686 --> 01:37:06,692
ASHLEY: Time for attack!

1550
01:37:06,692 --> 01:37:08,848
(laughter)

1551
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:13,043
ASHLEY: Am I close to the guy with the crossbow?

1552
01:37:13,043 --> 01:37:21,100
MATT: To which one? Crossbow, uh. You're about 20,
30 feet from him.

1553
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,591
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to move up a little bit,
because I'm going to Guiding Bolt him.

1554
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:26,745
MATT: All right.

1555
01:37:26,745 --> 01:37:30,645
ASHLEY: And I'm going to do it at second level.

1556
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,362
MATT: 2nd-level Guiding Bolt.

1557
01:37:32,362 --> 01:37:33,864
ASHLEY: But first I will roll for--

1558
01:37:33,864 --> 01:37:42,997
MATT: All righty. So what'd you roll to hit? With
your spell attack modifier?

1559
01:37:42,997 --> 01:37:44,765
ASHLEY: I rolled a 14.

1560
01:37:44,765 --> 01:37:49,076
MATT: 14 hits. That hits, so go ahead and roll 5d6
radiant damage on him.

1561
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:52,884
LAURA: Fuck. Guiding Bolt's pretty sick.

1562
01:37:52,884 --> 01:38:07,527
ASHLEY: Nice. Cool. 21.

1563
01:38:07,527 --> 01:38:14,401
MATT: 21, nice! So as you rush forward, keeping
your mace to the side, you put the shield down and

1564
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:19,067
the holy symbol itself drifts off you for a moment
and you focus for a second and without having to

1565
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:24,086
put your hands on it, a beam of divine energy
bursts forward, slamming into the

1566
01:38:24,086 --> 01:38:29,991
crossbow-wielding individual and seems to surround
their torso, causing them to glow like a giant

1567
01:38:29,991 --> 01:38:37,473
beacon that says hit me! They look down at this
tiny armored gnome that knocked half their life

1568
01:38:37,473 --> 01:38:44,720
out of their body with a bit of confusion, worry,
and respect in a weird way. Well done, gnome.

1569
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,425
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1570
01:38:46,425 --> 01:38:47,994
MATT: Okay, does that end your turn?

1571
01:38:47,994 --> 01:38:53,987
ASHLEY: Can I try to intimidate him, to tell him
to drop his bow?

1572
01:38:53,987 --> 01:38:57,736
MATT: Uh. As a bonus action, I'll let you do that,
sure.

1573
01:38:57,736 --> 01:39:00,438
ASHLEY: All right. Drop your bow!

1574
01:39:00,438 --> 01:39:02,215
(laughter)

1575
01:39:02,215 --> 01:39:04,778
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an intimidate
check.

1576
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:12,487
ASHLEY: Which I don't think I have any of that,
let's see. Oh, this is going to be hilarious. 11!

1577
01:39:12,487 --> 01:39:17,785
MATT: 11. As you shout, the individual gives you a
keen look and almost chuckles to himself, going,

1578
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:19,968
(laughs) "Silly gnome."

1579
01:39:19,968 --> 01:39:21,809
ASHLEY: It was a joke! It was a joke.

1580
01:39:21,809 --> 01:39:25,889
MATT: Puts the crossbow up, aiming it right
towards between the eyes.

1581
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:27,453
ASHLEY: Oh no!

1582
01:39:27,453 --> 01:39:30,010
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're
up.

1583
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:35,270
LAURA: Awesome. As my bonus action I'm going to
cast Hail of Thorns, so my next attack that hits

1584
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:36,778
turns into a poof.

1585
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:37,933
MATT: Burst, yes.

1586
01:39:37,933 --> 01:39:44,238
LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to do that and then I'm
going to cast-- I'm going to shoot-- oh shit. Can

1587
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:50,788
I shoot through the guy in front of me or to the
guy with the bolt? Or is that too hard?

1588
01:39:50,788 --> 01:39:56,539
MATT: You can, you could, I'd say. You're at
disadvantage already because you're in melee with

1589
01:39:56,539 --> 01:39:59,070
two individuals, so all your attacks are at
disadvantage right now.

1590
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:00,168
LAURA: Balls.

1591
01:40:00,168 --> 01:40:01,847
MATT: You can try and move away.

1592
01:40:01,847 --> 01:40:03,428
LAURA: But they would hit me?

1593
01:40:03,428 --> 01:40:04,447
MATT: They would attack you.

1594
01:40:04,447 --> 01:40:06,860
LAURA: I'm going to move back five feet.

1595
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,843
MATT: Okay, so you jump back that way.

1596
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:09,639
LAURA: Yeah.

1597
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:15,546
MATT: All right, that's two of them get swings at
you. That's a natural two, so no. That is a

1598
01:40:15,546 --> 01:40:18,839
natural eight, so 13, so misses you.

1599
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:27,065
LAURA: Fuck both of you, as I back up. And then I
shoot the arrow at the guy in the middle of the two.

1600
01:40:27,065 --> 01:40:29,379
MATT: Right there? All right, go for it.

1601
01:40:29,379 --> 01:40:38,286
LAURA: Okay. That is 22 to hit.

1602
01:40:38,286 --> 01:40:39,550
MATT: That hits.

1603
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:47,934
LAURA: Okay, so. That means-- I'm casting that at
third level, so that's 3d10 of damage.

1604
01:40:47,934 --> 01:40:49,208
MATT: Correct.

1605
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,395
LAURA: Right. And that's just my first attack.

1606
01:40:51,395 --> 01:40:52,509
MATT: All right.

1607
01:40:52,509 --> 01:40:54,055
LAURA: Where's my other dice?

1608
01:40:54,055 --> 01:40:56,084
MATT: And it's 3d10 against the first one.

1609
01:40:56,084 --> 01:41:02,468
LAURA: Come on! That's seven, eight, nine.

1610
01:41:02,468 --> 01:41:04,530
MATT: Nine? All righty.

1611
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:06,997
LAURA: Then, do I do that for each person or
that's it?

1612
01:41:06,997 --> 01:41:10,109
MATT: No, you then roll a d10 and they have to
make a dex saving throw to try and not get damage,

1613
01:41:10,109 --> 01:41:11,378
so roll a d10.

1614
01:41:11,378 --> 01:41:12,997
LAURA: That's a ten.

1615
01:41:12,997 --> 01:41:17,561
MATT: They all fail, so did more damage to the
guys around him than the actual--

1616
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:26,942
LAURA: Nice. And then I'm going to move Trinket
around. No, he's going to move up and attack the

1617
01:41:26,942 --> 01:41:28,383
guy in front of him.

1618
01:41:28,383 --> 01:41:31,153
MATT: You've done a bonus and an action.

1619
01:41:31,153 --> 01:41:33,378
LAURA: Yeah, so I get to cast--

1620
01:41:33,378 --> 01:41:37,079
MATT: Oh, I see, so your attack second, third, and
you get your one attack as part of the attack action.

1621
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:41,666
LAURA: Right. So I wanted Trinket to do his
Bestial Fury.

1622
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:43,024
MATT: Okay, so move up now and do it to
that--

1623
01:41:43,024 --> 01:41:45,689
LAURA: Yeah, he's doing Bestial Fury and claw that
motherfucker.

1624
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:48,049
MATT: Okay, this guy right there? Or that?

1625
01:41:48,049 --> 01:41:50,024
LAURA: That. No, the other one.

1626
01:41:50,024 --> 01:41:55,701
MATT: This one? All right. Go for it. So, as the
bear that just appeared now rears back, you fire

1627
01:41:55,701 --> 01:42:01,291
an arrow that explodes into a burst of sharpened
wooden bits. As they all reel from the

1628
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:07,297
impact, the bear (roars) and Trinket rushes
forward on his giant paws, releasing a torrent of

1629
01:42:07,297 --> 01:42:10,453
claw strikes against one of the unsuspecting
thugs.

1630
01:42:10,453 --> 01:42:12,531
LAURA: That's 14.

1631
01:42:12,531 --> 01:42:13,950
MATT: 14 hits.

1632
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:17,989
LAURA: And then 2d4 plus seven.

1633
01:42:17,989 --> 01:42:20,554
MATT: Correct. You get two attacks with Trinket,
by the way.

1634
01:42:20,554 --> 01:42:21,896
LAURA: Oh, sweet.

1635
01:42:21,896 --> 01:42:24,528
MATT: Because Trinket attacks twice when he does
Bestial--

1636
01:42:24,528 --> 01:42:26,064
LAURA: That's 11 on the first.

1637
01:42:26,064 --> 01:42:27,453
MATT: 11 damage.

1638
01:42:27,453 --> 01:42:30,846
LAURA: And 13 on the second.

1639
01:42:30,846 --> 01:42:40,722
MATT: Okay. So Trinket runs forward and one claw
tears the face off, jaw unhinged. The friend at

1640
01:42:40,722 --> 01:42:45,340
the side looks horrified as Trinket then bears
down with the secondary claw and takes the

1641
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,152
remainder of the head off the shoulders.

1642
01:42:47,152 --> 01:42:52,169
LAURA: Very nice, very nice.

1643
01:42:52,169 --> 01:42:54,177
SAM: Go Trinket.

1644
01:42:54,177 --> 01:42:57,221
MATT: Power in those claws. All right. That ends
your turn?

1645
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:58,241
LAURA: Yeah.

1646
01:42:58,241 --> 01:42:59,726
MATT: Percy, you're up.

1647
01:42:59,726 --> 01:43:01,479
TALIESIN: Is that crossbow asshole still
standing?

1648
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:02,777
MATT: The crossbow?

1649
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:04,852
TALIESIN: The guy who just laughed at our little
gnome?

1650
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:05,841
MATT: Yeah.

1651
01:43:05,841 --> 01:43:11,003
TALIESIN: Okay. I've just noticed that my guy was
going to hit me and then started acting weird, so

1652
01:43:11,003 --> 01:43:16,252
taking a second to look around, I'm going to see
that little laugh with the crossbow coming up and

1653
01:43:16,252 --> 01:43:18,710
Indiana Jones that shit.

1654
01:43:18,710 --> 01:43:20,977
MATT: Okay. Are you putting your Hex on him?

1655
01:43:20,977 --> 01:43:22,891
TALIESIN: I'm putting my Hex on him first.

1656
01:43:22,891 --> 01:43:24,526
MATT: Okay, bonus action to do that.

1657
01:43:24,526 --> 01:43:27,528
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot to that guy.

1658
01:43:27,528 --> 01:43:28,438
MATT: Go for it.

1659
01:43:28,438 --> 01:43:29,869
SAM: Don't hit Pike, don't hit Pike.

1660
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:30,964
TALIESIN: I'm not going to hit Pike.

1661
01:43:30,964 --> 01:43:32,119
SAM: She's right in the middle!

1662
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:33,129
LIAM: Only if it's a one.

1663
01:43:33,129 --> 01:43:34,138
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay.

1664
01:43:34,138 --> 01:43:43,684
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, I'm trying to
remember, what's my fuck-up number, my misfire

1665
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:45,068
number for that gun?

1666
01:43:45,068 --> 01:43:45,947
MATT: The pistol?

1667
01:43:45,947 --> 01:43:46,782
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1668
01:43:46,782 --> 01:43:47,708
MATT: One.

1669
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,141
TALIESIN: It's higher than one, I thought.

1670
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:53,115
MATT: No, the pistol's the most basic one. It's
one. But you rebuilt it, though.

1671
01:43:53,115 --> 01:43:54,033
TALIESIN: I did.

1672
01:43:54,033 --> 01:43:56,252
MATT: To not be that terrible. So now it's fine,
it's normal.

1673
01:43:56,252 --> 01:43:57,326
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

1674
01:43:57,326 --> 01:44:01,652
MATT: Yeah. Before you reconstructed it to try and
fix the mistake and remove that additional

1675
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,286
attachment, it would have been one.

1676
01:44:03,286 --> 01:44:06,744
TALIESIN: Thank you, I was just checking, because
I could've just rolled really poorly. Ten.

1677
01:44:06,744 --> 01:44:08,542
MATT: Ten misses, unfortunately.

1678
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:09,846
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking another--

1679
01:44:09,846 --> 01:44:15,593
MATT: Oh, there's the Guiding Bolt, right? It's
all right. Yeah, missed the Guiding Bolt, so you

1680
01:44:15,593 --> 01:44:17,404
have advantage on that attack, I'm pretty sure.

1681
01:44:17,404 --> 01:44:19,786
TALIESIN: Oh, so I'm going to roll it again.

1682
01:44:19,786 --> 01:44:21,455
LIAM: Thank you, Pike.

1683
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:22,870
ASHLEY: You're welcome!

1684
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:24,825
MARISHA: Same fucking roll.

1685
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,959
TALIESIN: I don't know what happened. Okay. Ten.
So that--

1686
01:44:26,959 --> 01:44:29,997
MATT: So that one fires and now you're out of
bullets.

1687
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:32,169
TALIESIN: I know, so now I'm going to reload and
fire again.

1688
01:44:32,169 --> 01:44:34,332
MATT: Okay, so your second and third attack. Go
for it.

1689
01:44:34,332 --> 01:44:38,810
MARISHA: Oh my god!

1690
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,619
TALIESIN: I have advantage though, right?

1691
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:43,335
MATT: You have advantage. I think you do, hold on,
let me see.

1692
01:44:43,335 --> 01:44:44,931
MARISHA: There we go, that's better.

1693
01:44:44,931 --> 01:44:52,136
MATT: Hold on, hold on. Next attack, no, it does
not have advantage. So that misses as well,

1694
01:44:52,136 --> 01:44:53,101
probably.

1695
01:44:53,101 --> 01:44:54,372
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing!

1696
01:44:54,372 --> 01:44:55,759
MATT: So! War God's Blessing?

1697
01:44:55,759 --> 01:44:59,964
ASHLEY: Yeah, it adds ten to his roll. Attack
roll.

1698
01:44:59,964 --> 01:45:01,788
MATT: Okay, so it now becomes a 20.

1699
01:45:01,788 --> 01:45:02,942
TALIESIN: Oh.

1700
01:45:02,942 --> 01:45:04,332
SAM: What is War God's Blessing?

1701
01:45:04,332 --> 01:45:07,789
MATT: So War God's Blessing is one of her cleric
abilities, since she chose the war domain after

1702
01:45:07,789 --> 01:45:13,083
going to sea for a while. The specifics of it,
just so you guys are aware of it, and why it's so useful--

1703
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:14,883
ASHLEY: It's something I forget about a lot.

1704
01:45:14,883 --> 01:45:15,805
TALIESIN: Oh, yay!

1705
01:45:15,805 --> 01:45:20,229
MATT: She can basically, as a reaction, grant plus
ten to an attack roll.

1706
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:22,384
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hit, then. That hits.

1707
01:45:22,384 --> 01:45:28,341
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage now. So, as
you're about to aim, Pike looks over and sees you

1708
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:31,937
about to take the shot and concentrates for a
moment and the front of your barrel begins to glow

1709
01:45:31,937 --> 01:45:36,835
with divine light as you fire. The bullet itself
actually is white-hot as it leaves the barrel.

1710
01:45:36,835 --> 01:45:38,492
TALIESIN: This is such a confused gun.

1711
01:45:38,492 --> 01:45:39,475
MATT: I know.

1712
01:45:39,475 --> 01:45:47,069
TALIESIN: Okay. That's not bad. That's 20 plus
five necrotic.

1713
01:45:47,069 --> 01:45:56,338
MATT: Okay. The impact of the divine enchanted
bullet hits the current dark-energy-hexed

1714
01:45:56,338 --> 01:46:03,690
individual and in the blast of light versus dark
the upper torso of the thug is incinerated. It is

1715
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:09,912
ash. The waist below visible as it slumps over, no
longer visible.

1716
01:46:09,912 --> 01:46:12,121
MARISHA: That was awesome!

1717
01:46:12,121 --> 01:46:17,572
TALIESIN: And I'm going to start walking my way
towards Keyleth's special friend. Yeah, about there.

1718
01:46:17,572 --> 01:46:18,878
MATT: There? Okay.

1719
01:46:18,878 --> 01:46:20,823
TALIESIN: I'm not running. I'm walking.

1720
01:46:20,823 --> 01:46:29,864
MATT: All right. It's now their turn. The dwarf
now moves over, goes, "Of course." And begins

1721
01:46:29,864 --> 01:46:34,830
taking all of its weapons and throws its mace down
and puts its crossbow at your feet, spends its

1722
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:38,638
entire turn emptying its pouch and handing you
what gold and gems and things it gathered.

1723
01:46:38,638 --> 01:46:40,229
LAURA: This is the best thing ever!

1724
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:43,897
MATT: And giving you everything with a big
dwarvish smile underneath its crusty beard.

1725
01:46:43,897 --> 01:46:46,898
SAM: Thank you. You're doing a good service.

1726
01:46:46,898 --> 01:46:48,982
TALIESIN: Make him shave.

1727
01:46:48,982 --> 01:46:52,408
LAURA: That is mean.

1728
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:53,665
TALIESIN: I know!

1729
01:46:53,665 --> 01:47:00,369
MATT: This one's going to attack Keyleth. So, the
one attacking Keyleth. This is the one attacking

1730
01:47:00,369 --> 01:47:01,314
you, Keyleth.

1731
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:02,221
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

1732
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:04,635
MATT: It saw you transform into Minxie. That's
going to be, what's your AC?

1733
01:47:04,635 --> 01:47:09,207
MARISHA: As a tiger? Or no, I keep my AC, right?
Or no, I take the tiger's AC.

1734
01:47:09,207 --> 01:47:15,680
MATT: It should be in your ability, your Wild
Shape ability. I'm pretty sure you take it as the

1735
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:16,749
creature.

1736
01:47:16,749 --> 01:47:17,792
MARISHA: Then 11.

1737
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:25,216
MATT: 11, that hits. Just making sure that's the
case right now, real fast as we go over to this point.

1738
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:31,261
MARISHA: I know I keep all of my brain stats, but
I lose all my physical stats.

1739
01:47:31,261 --> 01:47:37,965
MATT: Correct. Yeah, you gain the AC of the
creature as well.

1740
01:47:37,965 --> 01:47:39,313
MARISHA: Okay, so 11.

1741
01:47:39,313 --> 01:47:40,708
MATT: All right, so.

1742
01:47:40,708 --> 01:47:45,978
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait. 12.

1743
01:47:45,978 --> 01:47:50,190
MATT: 12 is the AC? First one misses, second one
hits.

1744
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:52,014
MARISHA: Oh, cool! Okay, cool.

1745
01:47:52,014 --> 01:47:58,872
MATT: It rolled 11 on the first attack. So, you do
take 11 points of bludgeoning damage as the mace

1746
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:02,196
swings out and smacks into the side of your
shoulder. You feel the impact, but it's nothing

1747
01:48:02,196 --> 01:48:08,303
too harsh. There are two of them now that are
trying to go against Grog, being the angry one

1748
01:48:08,303 --> 01:48:13,131
that just bisected their ally. They have advantage
on you because they are both pack tactics. The

1749
01:48:13,131 --> 01:48:15,826
first attack is a 23.

1750
01:48:15,826 --> 01:48:17,227
TRAVIS: That hits.

1751
01:48:17,227 --> 01:48:23,693
MATT: Second one is a natural 20. Third attack,
with advantage, is 15.

1752
01:48:23,693 --> 01:48:24,911
TRAVIS: Misses.

1753
01:48:24,911 --> 01:48:27,935
MATT: Misses. And the fourth and final one is a
17.

1754
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:28,812
TRAVIS: Misses.

1755
01:48:28,812 --> 01:48:41,042
MATT: So a hit and a natural 20. Okay, so that is
nine reduced to five against you. And then 12

1756
01:48:41,042 --> 01:48:44,851
reduced to six, so you take 11 points of
bludgeoning damage between the two of them trying

1757
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:51,247
to beat on this furious angry goliath individual.
And then there's one over here that's attacking

1758
01:48:51,247 --> 01:48:53,193
Trinket now that's right in front.

1759
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:58,070
LAURA: He just saw Trinket rip somebody else's
face off.

1760
01:48:58,070 --> 01:49:02,259
MATT: Yeah, and in doing so swings out with a 13.
I'm pretty sure misses Trinket's AC.

1761
01:49:02,259 --> 01:49:06,698
LAURA: Oh, yeah it does. He's got a better armor
class than me.

1762
01:49:06,698 --> 01:49:11,203
MATT: He swings out, shaken by what it just saw
happen to its friend and then takes that anger and

1763
01:49:11,203 --> 01:49:16,636
turns around, rolling a 23, which I'm pretty sure
hits. The mace slams into the side of Trinket's

1764
01:49:16,636 --> 01:49:22,875
armor with a resounding (loud impact), the actual
echo of the metal impact audible in the immediate

1765
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:25,966
vicinity, dealing a total of seven points of
bludgeoning damage to Trinket.

1766
01:49:25,966 --> 01:49:29,268
LAURA: He's resistant to bludgeoning damage
because of his armor.

1767
01:49:29,268 --> 01:49:33,335
MATT: Yep, so that would make it four. All right,
that ends their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

1768
01:49:33,335 --> 01:49:38,800
MARISHA: Okay. Really pissed off at this guy
still. I'm going to concentrate and bring down a

1769
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,054
bolt of lightning in front of him, or behind--

1770
01:49:42,054 --> 01:49:43,226
MATT: Right there?

1771
01:49:43,226 --> 01:49:44,145
MARISHA: Yeah.

1772
01:49:44,145 --> 01:49:46,003
SAM: Dragons can see bolts of lightning.

1773
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:47,624
MARISHA: It's also a cloudy day.

1774
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:48,950
SAM: All right, all right, that makes sense.

1775
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:55,534
MATT: Second bolt of lightning strikes the ground
behind the guy in front of you. He rolled a 20, so

1776
01:49:55,534 --> 01:49:59,834
he did make his save I'm pretty sure against you.
Roll 4d10. He takes half-damage.

1777
01:49:59,834 --> 01:50:12,309
MARISHA: So, okay. Six, ten, 21 points, so ten?

1778
01:50:12,309 --> 01:50:13,945
MATT: Ten points of damage.

1779
01:50:13,945 --> 01:50:18,058
MARISHA: And then I'm going to do an attack on
him. Grr.

1780
01:50:18,058 --> 01:50:21,862
MATT: Uh, you have to use your action to pull the
bolt down, though?

1781
01:50:21,862 --> 01:50:23,278
MARISHA: I thought it was bonus.

1782
01:50:23,278 --> 01:50:27,561
MATT: It should say on the spell. I'll
double-check.

1783
01:50:27,561 --> 01:50:32,488
MARISHA: I thought you could do that with Call
Lightning.

1784
01:50:32,488 --> 01:50:39,800
MATT: Call Lightning, uh. On each of your turns,
you can use your action to call it down, so yeah.

1785
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,386
A bolt is what you got.

1786
01:50:41,386 --> 01:50:42,825
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine.

1787
01:50:42,825 --> 01:50:48,944
MATT: Okay. However, the individual now is twice
hit by lightning and is looking extremely rough

1788
01:50:48,944 --> 01:50:53,377
and barely standing on his two feet. Is that your
turn?

1789
01:50:53,377 --> 01:50:55,159
MARISHA: I can't do anything else, can I?

1790
01:50:55,159 --> 01:50:56,419
MATT: Okay, Garthok, you're up.

1791
01:50:56,419 --> 01:51:01,999
JASON: Garthok attacks the one attacking Trinket.

1792
01:51:01,999 --> 01:51:02,983
MATT: Okay.

1793
01:51:02,983 --> 01:51:05,778
JASON: And I can sneak attack, right?

1794
01:51:05,778 --> 01:51:08,636
MATT: Yeah, he's currently distracted between you
and Trinket.

1795
01:51:08,636 --> 01:51:10,373
SAM: What are you going to do, what are you going
to do?

1796
01:51:10,373 --> 01:51:15,404
MATT: Roll to hit first.

1797
01:51:15,404 --> 01:51:17,653
JASON: Oh yeah. I was so excited.

1798
01:51:17,653 --> 01:51:19,356
SAM: What if you miss?

1799
01:51:19,356 --> 01:51:21,140
LAURA: He won't miss.

1800
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:22,598
JASON: 13.

1801
01:51:22,598 --> 01:51:24,401
MATT: 13 does hit.

1802
01:51:24,401 --> 01:51:26,501
(cheering)

1803
01:51:26,501 --> 01:51:28,058
TRAVIS: Skewer that piece of shit.

1804
01:51:28,058 --> 01:51:31,903
MARISHA: Nice! That's hot.

1805
01:51:31,903 --> 01:51:34,705
TRAVIS: Let the dice hit the floor.

1806
01:51:34,705 --> 01:51:38,447
JASON: 20.

1807
01:51:38,447 --> 01:51:46,161
MATT: 20 points. All right. So you take the spear
and jam it into the abdomen of this looter here

1808
01:51:46,161 --> 01:51:50,903
who, the sheer force of it from the strength as
your muscles push in lifts him and slams him

1809
01:51:50,903 --> 01:51:55,786
against the wall, you've partially pinned him
against the stonework there. He reaches over and

1810
01:51:55,786 --> 01:51:59,578
slams down on your hand repeatedly until
eventually you withdraw and leave him back on his

1811
01:51:59,578 --> 01:52:04,844
feet. He's looking rough, but he's definitely
still holding his own. Is that--?

1812
01:52:04,844 --> 01:52:09,096
JASON: Can I use my cunning action with my hand
crossbow or--?

1813
01:52:09,096 --> 01:52:13,172
MATT: Well, you can use a bonus action to fire
with your hand crossbow at him if you want to.

1814
01:52:13,172 --> 01:52:14,129
JASON: Yeah.

1815
01:52:14,129 --> 01:52:17,081
MATT: All right. It's at disadvantage because you
are in melee with him, so go ahead and roll twice

1816
01:52:17,081 --> 01:52:18,712
and take the lower of the two.

1817
01:52:18,712 --> 01:52:20,630
LAURA: This will be sick, though, if he hit it.

1818
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:28,632
SAM: Those are stinky dice.

1819
01:52:28,632 --> 01:52:31,553
JASON: 11. 11.

1820
01:52:31,553 --> 01:52:33,113
MATT: 11 just hits.

1821
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:35,412
(cheering)

1822
01:52:35,412 --> 01:52:39,926
MATT: That's his AC. All right, so go ahead and
roll damage with the hand crossbow. 1d6 plus

1823
01:52:39,926 --> 01:52:40,861
whatever.

1824
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:42,379
LAURA: Right in the face!

1825
01:52:42,379 --> 01:52:43,321
JASON: Six.

1826
01:52:43,321 --> 01:52:49,289
MATT: Six points of damage. As you pull the spear
out, you reach to your side and over-the-arm pull

1827
01:52:49,289 --> 01:52:52,768
the hand crossbow out and fire. It goes right into
his left eye socket.

1828
01:52:52,768 --> 01:52:56,128
(cheering)

1829
01:52:56,128 --> 01:53:04,595
MATT: With that, you set the spear to the side and
lock in the next bolt for your hand crossbow. Are

1830
01:53:04,595 --> 01:53:06,215
you staying there?

1831
01:53:06,215 --> 01:53:07,157
JASON: Yeah.

1832
01:53:07,157 --> 01:53:08,753
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're
up.

1833
01:53:08,753 --> 01:53:13,971
TRAVIS: The poor bastard that's closest to you to
my upper right, yeah, that little fuck's going to

1834
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:16,822
get Great Weapon Master relentless attacks.

1835
01:53:16,822 --> 01:53:18,285
MATT: (laughs) Okay, all three?

1836
01:53:18,285 --> 01:53:19,279
TRAVIS: All three.

1837
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:20,943
MATT: Go for it.

1838
01:53:20,943 --> 01:53:25,813
TRAVIS: That is better. 14?

1839
01:53:25,813 --> 01:53:26,986
MATT: Hits.

1840
01:53:26,986 --> 01:53:30,242
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll take that one.

1841
01:53:30,242 --> 01:53:33,423
LAURA: You could've been a 20, though, your next
one could be a 20.

1842
01:53:33,423 --> 01:53:35,081
MATT: Yeah, roll again. You never know.

1843
01:53:35,081 --> 01:53:36,677
LAURA: It was a 20!

1844
01:53:36,677 --> 01:53:38,335
MARISHA: Shut up!

1845
01:53:38,335 --> 01:53:44,083
MATT: Which, as a note, at your level when you
crit you do two additional dice on top of it. So

1846
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:50,133
you roll, double it, and then do two additional
dice as one of your barbarian--

1847
01:53:50,133 --> 01:53:52,118
TRAVIS: I had one additional damage dice.

1848
01:53:52,118 --> 01:53:56,801
MATT: For this last level 13, you get two now.

1849
01:53:56,801 --> 01:53:57,899
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

1850
01:53:57,899 --> 01:53:59,148
SAM: This guy's going to be a puddle--

1851
01:53:59,148 --> 01:54:00,718
LAURA: Another natural 20!

1852
01:54:00,718 --> 01:54:02,572
SAM: Wait, does he get two more?

1853
01:54:02,572 --> 01:54:09,158
TRAVIS: On crits or kills, it's an extra hit.

1854
01:54:09,158 --> 01:54:15,550
MATT: Extra attack, okay. (laughs) Okay, so first,
hold on, first roll damage for the first attack

1855
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:16,611
against this one.

1856
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:17,979
TRAVIS: Me and the sword are vibing, man.

1857
01:54:17,979 --> 01:54:19,491
MATT: Right. Roll damage on the first one.

1858
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:20,799
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah.

1859
01:54:20,799 --> 01:54:22,182
LIAM: You're playing jazz, man.

1860
01:54:22,182 --> 01:54:26,109
TRAVIS: 18, 28.

1861
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:31,030
MATT: 28, which fails save, you get another plus
one to your strength.

1862
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:32,932
LAURA: Oh my god.

1863
01:54:32,932 --> 01:54:34,217
TRAVIS: Just the strength, right?

1864
01:54:34,217 --> 01:54:42,302
MATT: Exactly. Second attack, which is the
critical. So, roll the dice, double that, add your

1865
01:54:42,302 --> 01:54:44,019
modifier, and then add 2d12 to that.

1866
01:54:44,019 --> 01:54:51,741
TRAVIS: That's a lot of math. Roll another dice.
That's a six--

1867
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:53,962
LAURA: 2d12.

1868
01:54:53,962 --> 01:55:00,200
TRAVIS: 29, 40, 44?

1869
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,453
SAM: What?

1870
01:55:01,453 --> 01:55:04,854
MATT: And failed the save again. That's another
plus one to your strength.

1871
01:55:04,854 --> 01:55:06,222
TRAVIS: That goes up two.

1872
01:55:06,222 --> 01:55:07,253
MATT: Yeah.

1873
01:55:07,253 --> 01:55:08,388
MARISHA: That keeps happening?

1874
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:15,966
MATT: So as you, the first two attacks, whoosh,
cut off the right arm of that individual, and

1875
01:55:15,966 --> 01:55:20,273
using that momentum, you bring it around and
bisect him in the midsection. As that happens, you

1876
01:55:20,273 --> 01:55:24,578
can see the blood turns from red to black as the
blade drinks it up and you feel your muscles pulse

1877
01:55:24,578 --> 01:55:25,618
with energy.

1878
01:55:25,618 --> 01:55:26,616
TRAVIS: Yes!

1879
01:55:26,616 --> 01:55:28,607
MATT: Just falls back on the ground.

1880
01:55:28,607 --> 01:55:30,731
LAURA: So now you can take the other guy, because
you killed him.

1881
01:55:30,731 --> 01:55:32,327
TRAVIS: I critted on the third one.

1882
01:55:32,327 --> 01:55:36,733
MATT: The third one, I'll say because you killed
him the third crit goes to the next guy, so go

1883
01:55:36,733 --> 01:55:39,117
ahead and roll damage on that.

1884
01:55:39,117 --> 01:55:47,003
TRAVIS: 22, 32.

1885
01:55:47,003 --> 01:55:48,741
LIAM: He's gone.

1886
01:55:48,741 --> 01:55:56,360
MATT: Okay. And now you get your additional attack
because of the Great Weapon Master.

1887
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,430
LAURA: Oh my lord.

1888
01:55:58,430 --> 01:56:00,761
MATT: With advantage, because barbarians, man.

1889
01:56:00,761 --> 01:56:02,129
TRAVIS: 21?

1890
01:56:02,129 --> 01:56:09,714
MATT: Hits. When barbarians crit, man, things die.
This is why relentless attack is so good with

1891
01:56:09,714 --> 01:56:11,621
them. They take the penalty to their AC.

1892
01:56:11,621 --> 01:56:12,838
TRAVIS: 24 points.

1893
01:56:12,838 --> 01:56:14,273
MATT: 24 points of damage.

1894
01:56:14,273 --> 01:56:16,831
TRAVIS: Oh no, 34 points of damage because it's
Great Weapon Master.

1895
01:56:16,831 --> 01:56:21,155
MATT: Failed save. All right. It made the last
one, all right.

1896
01:56:21,155 --> 01:56:23,007
TRAVIS: Oh, plus two, 36 points.

1897
01:56:23,007 --> 01:56:28,087
MATT: So there you go. So you get another plus one
to your strength. However, this time you take the

1898
01:56:28,087 --> 01:56:33,138
blade and the first attack you jam it into their
abdomen like this. As they're looking at you,

1899
01:56:33,138 --> 01:56:38,582
grasping at your shoulders, your eyes completely
covered in bloodlust, the foam at the corner of

1900
01:56:38,582 --> 01:56:43,674
your mouth, you then put all of your strength at
the bottom of it and completely cut upward, the

1901
01:56:43,674 --> 01:56:46,147
body splitting in half as it falls to the ground.

1902
01:56:46,147 --> 01:56:51,709
(laughter)

1903
01:56:51,709 --> 01:56:53,214
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1904
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:55,533
TRAVIS: I've never been more happy in my life.

1905
01:56:55,533 --> 01:57:00,107
ASHLEY: Oh man, I'm coming back as a barbarian if
I die.

1906
01:57:00,107 --> 01:57:02,355
MATT: All right, Scanlan, you're up.

1907
01:57:02,355 --> 01:57:03,792
SAM: Oh, there's more people?

1908
01:57:03,792 --> 01:57:08,619
MATT: There's one guy over here by Keyleth who
currently hasn't even noticed what's going on

1909
01:57:08,619 --> 01:57:11,967
because he got hit with lightning twice and is being
attacked by a giant tiger.

1910
01:57:11,967 --> 01:57:22,276
SAM: All right. I guess I'll try to intimidate him
to stop, and I'll say, I'll turn to him and say,

1911
01:57:22,276 --> 01:57:35,409
you there! Idiot! (stutters) You're not going to
win! You should not fight anymore! Because you're

1912
01:57:35,409 --> 01:57:38,924
going to die. And that's it, that's all I got.

1913
01:57:38,924 --> 01:57:40,789
MATT: Okay, roll intimidation check.

1914
01:57:40,789 --> 01:57:42,952
LAURA: Worst intimidation ever.

1915
01:57:42,952 --> 01:57:45,527
SAM: 22.

1916
01:57:45,527 --> 01:57:51,883
MATT: And yet the conviction behind the words--
the heart behind each stuttered moment of that

1917
01:57:51,883 --> 01:57:53,046
sentence--

1918
01:57:53,046 --> 01:57:57,872
SAM: You know what, I'll sing to him to intimidate
him, would that help?

1919
01:57:57,872 --> 01:57:59,315
MATT: If you want to, go for it.

1920
01:57:59,315 --> 01:58:05,195
SAM: Sure. I will sing, (singing) Some people call
me a gnome cowboy. Some people call me the

1921
01:58:05,195 --> 01:58:06,426
gangster of love.

1922
01:58:06,426 --> 01:58:08,532
TALIESIN: Nobody calls him the gangster of love.

1923
01:58:08,532 --> 01:58:14,760
SAM: (singing) Some people call me Maurice because
I'm a hitter, I'm a winner, I'm a bedroom shitter.

1924
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,256
(laughter)

1925
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:20,296
SAM: (singing) Playing my music on my shawm,
oooh.

1926
01:58:20,296 --> 01:58:27,377
MATT: Which, right where the guitar would go
(high-pitched guitar), you hear the clanging of

1927
01:58:27,377 --> 01:58:32,710
weapons to the ground as the other remaining thug
looks around and sees the mess that you've made of

1928
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:37,186
all of his various compadres and immediately drops
to the ground, hand over his head, going:

1929
01:58:37,186 --> 01:58:39,200
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"

1930
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:43,508
LAURA: We shouldn't have taken him hostage. I
wanted to just kill him.

1931
01:58:43,508 --> 01:58:44,810
TRAVIS: Oh, don't worry.

1932
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:46,003
JASON: We can still kill him.

1933
01:58:46,003 --> 01:58:50,463
SAM: And as my bonus action, I tell the dwarf to
start collecting all the stuff from all the other

1934
01:58:50,463 --> 01:58:51,561
people as well.

1935
01:58:51,561 --> 01:58:57,290
MATT: "Certainly. Right away." See if he makes his
save. He does not. So he then walks over and

1936
01:58:57,290 --> 01:59:01,001
starts looting the corpses of his friends for you.
(laughs)

1937
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:03,791
TALIESIN: That's dark. That's dark.

1938
01:59:03,791 --> 01:59:09,653
MATT: All right, so there's the one guy who's on
the ground now, hands over his head.

1939
01:59:09,653 --> 01:59:12,658
TRAVIS: Is he the only one left?

1940
01:59:12,658 --> 01:59:14,599
MATT: He's the only one left.

1941
01:59:14,599 --> 01:59:16,690
LAURA: And the dwarf who is looting things now.

1942
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:21,528
MARISHA: I stay in Minxie form and stay on him,
growling at him.

1943
01:59:21,528 --> 01:59:23,069
MATT: Okay.

1944
01:59:23,069 --> 01:59:25,708
LAURA: I, actually, you know what? Instead of
looting, I'm going to--

1945
01:59:25,708 --> 01:59:33,402
MATT: Slowly the rain begins to hit as the storm
finally starts coming down, elevated by the druid

1946
01:59:33,402 --> 01:59:37,162
spells that brought the moisture to gather over
this section. You walk over to him.

1947
01:59:37,162 --> 01:59:42,422
LAURA: I'm actually going to start using
perception to look for any sign of Gilmore in the

1948
01:59:42,422 --> 01:59:43,663
rubble or--

1949
01:59:43,663 --> 01:59:46,003
SAM: Gilmore? Use your dragon perception, lady.

1950
01:59:46,003 --> 01:59:49,231
MATT: This would be more of an investigation
check. As you begin to pore over the rubble

1951
01:59:49,231 --> 01:59:50,466
yourself to gather it--

1952
01:59:50,466 --> 01:59:55,790
LAURA: Okay. I leave him to you all.

1953
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:57,163
TRAVIS: Where's the meat?

1954
01:59:57,163 --> 02:00:00,527
LIAM: It was my turn in initiative, so I want to
walk over to him.

1955
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:01,703
MATT: Okay.

1956
02:00:01,703 --> 02:00:03,539
LAURA: Natural 20 on investigation.

1957
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:07,300
MARISHA: Oh, that's going to be good. That's
good.

1958
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:13,400
MATT: All righty. So you walk over, so as she's
investigating it, you go ahead and you walk over

1959
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,641
to him.

1960
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:21,644
LIAM: You're coming with me. I lift him up and I'm
leading him off around the corner of a building.

1961
02:00:21,644 --> 02:00:24,297
MARISHA: I pace along as Minxie.

1962
02:00:24,297 --> 02:00:26,564
MATT: Okay. Garthok, you doing anything?

1963
02:00:26,564 --> 02:00:28,520
JASON: I go with them.

1964
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:34,376
MATT: Okay, so the half-orc saunters up next to
the tiger and you guys disappear around the corner

1965
02:00:34,376 --> 02:00:36,208
of one of the nearby buildings.

1966
02:00:36,208 --> 02:00:38,255
JASON: I just start cleaning my spear in front of
him.

1967
02:00:38,255 --> 02:00:39,753
MATT: Okay.

1968
02:00:39,753 --> 02:00:42,979
MARISHA: I pace around.

1969
02:00:42,979 --> 02:00:44,615
MATT: All right, you lead him and you slam him up
against the wall.

1970
02:00:44,615 --> 02:00:47,598
MATT: "Look, look, what do you want?"

1971
02:00:47,598 --> 02:00:50,671
LIAM: Nothing.

1972
02:00:50,671 --> 02:00:52,326
SAM: Oh, you knocking him out?

1973
02:00:52,326 --> 02:00:55,314
MATT: Whack, you take him off the side of the head
and he crumples into a pile there in the alley.

1974
02:00:55,314 --> 02:01:02,733
LIAM: Pick up some shit from the ground and prop
it up against him, a couple of pieces, not bury

1975
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:04,258
him, just hide him a bit.

1976
02:01:04,258 --> 02:01:05,521
MATT: Okay.

1977
02:01:05,521 --> 02:01:09,182
LIAM: And then I walk back to the group and I
start picking shit up around where my

1978
02:01:09,182 --> 02:01:10,339
sister is.

1979
02:01:10,339 --> 02:01:13,766
MARISHA: I go back, I guess. I was useful.

1980
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,309
JASON: I thought we were going to interrogate
him.

1981
02:01:15,309 --> 02:01:19,765
MARISHA: Me, too. (laughs) I came along as
intimidation.

1982
02:01:19,765 --> 02:01:21,081
LIAM: Looters?

1983
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:24,825
MARISHA: But he was bringing stuff back and forth
to--

1984
02:01:24,825 --> 02:01:30,379
LAURA: Well, he's still there. And we do have a
dwarf that's mind-controlled right now. That is

1985
02:01:30,379 --> 02:01:31,679
probably the best.

1986
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,354
MATT: Who is currently looting the bodies.

1987
02:01:34,354 --> 02:01:38,005
LAURA: Don't touch anything. I'm investigating.

1988
02:01:38,005 --> 02:01:44,562
MATT: As you are going through the rubble, you can
see a lot of the rubble has been moved over, and

1989
02:01:44,562 --> 02:01:49,663
you see remnants of shattered glass cases and
shelves and a lot of the things that you had

1990
02:01:49,663 --> 02:01:55,233
previously seen within Gilmore's Glorious Goods,
largely picked over and left behind. Many books

1991
02:01:55,233 --> 02:02:00,447
lie tattered and burned and destroyed as part of
the attack. You get the sense here that most

1992
02:02:00,447 --> 02:02:06,335
anything that was of use or worth has been taken
already and what the people here were gathering,

1993
02:02:06,335 --> 02:02:09,859
they mentioned this was their third time back,
they were basically picking up what remnants they

1994
02:02:09,859 --> 02:02:15,211
could, which were pieces of broken objects,
elements of gold that were left behind, but most

1995
02:02:15,211 --> 02:02:19,060
of the contents of the store have been ransacked
and taken.

1996
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:24,132
SAM: Can I specifically look for the beaded
curtain he emerges from?

1997
02:02:24,132 --> 02:02:29,651
MATT: Yes, actually. And as you guys go toward the
beaded curtain, it's torn apart and under a big

1998
02:02:29,651 --> 02:02:34,428
piece of rock. You push aside and, with the help
of Grog and a few other individuals, you guys move

1999
02:02:34,428 --> 02:02:41,531
some of the rocks out of the way to where the
bedroom is, and it's completely destroyed. There's

2000
02:02:41,531 --> 02:02:48,059
no sign of Gilmore or anybody else here, and as
the rain's starting to come down a little heavier,

2001
02:02:48,059 --> 02:02:56,505
you all get that sense of horror washing over you.
Vex, you notice, looking underneath where the

2002
02:02:56,505 --> 02:03:04,911
shattered remains of the foot of his bed are,
there is a smooth piece of stone with a handle.

2003
02:03:04,911 --> 02:03:07,767
SAM: And a barrel of lube.

2004
02:03:07,767 --> 02:03:11,098
LAURA: I rush over to it.

2005
02:03:11,098 --> 02:03:12,428
MATT: Okay.

2006
02:03:12,428 --> 02:03:15,080
LAURA: Can I detect traps now?

2007
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:19,446
MATT: I mean, you could technically detect traps
whenever you wanted to try.

2008
02:03:19,446 --> 02:03:20,480
LAURA: Oh.

2009
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,130
MATT: You have to have sight for it. If you want
to, go ahead and make a perception check.

2010
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:30,113
LAURA: 26.

2011
02:03:30,113 --> 02:03:35,303
MATT: 26. You take a moment to inspect it. You
follow the edge, and yes, it is indeed a false

2012
02:03:35,303 --> 02:03:42,825
door made of this stone tile that comprises the
floor of the room, and it is a hatch. It is not trapped.

2013
02:03:42,825 --> 02:03:45,342
LAURA: I start pushing on the bed and call for
Grog and say, help me with this!

2014
02:03:45,342 --> 02:03:48,528
TRAVIS: What? Oh! Run over. I help.

2015
02:03:48,528 --> 02:03:49,936
LAURA: There's a door.

2016
02:03:49,936 --> 02:03:51,786
LIAM: I hear her yelling and wander up as well.

2017
02:03:51,786 --> 02:03:52,687
MATT: Okay.

2018
02:03:52,687 --> 02:03:54,530
MARISHA: Still in Minxie, pace over.

2019
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:58,717
MATT: The dwarf comes running up with you guys as
well, still--

2020
02:03:58,717 --> 02:04:01,797
LAURA: Did he get everything? I mean, did he loot
everything, are we--?

2021
02:04:01,797 --> 02:04:10,167
MATT: He comes up with all the various coin purses
which, interestingly enough, are mostly empty

2022
02:04:10,167 --> 02:04:14,214
other than a few copper. It seems like whatever
they've stolen is not on them currently.

2023
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:15,808
SAM: They gave it to the dragon.

2024
02:04:15,808 --> 02:04:17,037
LAURA: Assholes.

2025
02:04:17,037 --> 02:04:18,341
TRAVIS: They gave it to <i>him</i>.

2026
02:04:18,341 --> 02:04:19,510
LAURA: The dragon.

2027
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:21,527
SAM: Him. Whatever that is.

2028
02:04:21,527 --> 02:04:22,620
TRAVIS: Did we ask?

2029
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,522
SAM: No.

2030
02:04:23,522 --> 02:04:25,591
LIAM: You've got a happy dwarf standing--

2031
02:04:25,591 --> 02:04:27,371
SAM: Oi, dwarf.

2032
02:04:27,371 --> 02:04:28,598
MATT: "Aye."

2033
02:04:28,598 --> 02:04:33,860
SAM: Who have you been collecting swag for?

2034
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:35,163
MATT: "The dragon."

2035
02:04:35,163 --> 02:04:36,161
SAM: Okay.

2036
02:04:36,161 --> 02:04:38,280
(laughter)

2037
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:43,935
MATT: "As long as we give him what's important and
what's worth, he'll keep us alive. Even protect us."

2038
02:04:43,935 --> 02:04:46,275
SAM: He told you this?

2039
02:04:46,275 --> 02:04:47,689
ASHLEY: Where are you taking it to?

2040
02:04:47,689 --> 02:04:54,857
MATT: "To the center of town. Which I've never
been before, the Cloudtop itself. What stands is

2041
02:04:54,857 --> 02:04:56,172
"very pretty."

2042
02:04:56,172 --> 02:04:58,395
SAM: The gates to it are open?

2043
02:04:58,395 --> 02:04:59,501
MATT: "Aye."

2044
02:04:59,501 --> 02:05:07,103
SAM: And the dragon sits there in the open,
collecting his bounty?

2045
02:05:07,103 --> 02:05:09,521
MATT: "There's lines, folks lined up bringing all
they have to him."

2046
02:05:09,521 --> 02:05:15,217
JASON: So if this is your third trip back, the
first two, you already took it to him or did

2047
02:05:15,217 --> 02:05:17,805
you take it somewhere else to store?

2048
02:05:17,805 --> 02:05:20,195
MATT: "Well, we've put it all in a place so that
then we can take it to him."

2049
02:05:20,195 --> 02:05:21,537
JASON: Take us to that place.

2050
02:05:21,537 --> 02:05:23,673
MATT: "All right." And he turns around and starts
walking away.

2051
02:05:23,673 --> 02:05:24,940
JASON: Sorry.

2052
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:26,166
SAM: No, that's fine.

2053
02:05:26,166 --> 02:05:27,657
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, not yet!

2054
02:05:27,657 --> 02:05:33,567
LAURA: But wait, tell us where it is, how about
that? How about you tell us where it is. Right now.

2055
02:05:33,567 --> 02:05:35,103
MATT: "Certainly."

2056
02:05:35,103 --> 02:05:44,042
MATT: And he explains about a 15-minute walk from
here there is a well that is in between four

2057
02:05:44,042 --> 02:05:48,399
buildings in an alley cross-section. All of it's
been actually put into the well, which has been

2058
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:53,647
hollowed out, or all the water's been repressed
with dirt, and it's been filled with everything

2059
02:05:53,647 --> 02:05:55,849
they've gathered.

2060
02:05:55,849 --> 02:06:01,504
LAURA: He's going to save eventually. He's going
to break your mind control. Maybe we should knock

2061
02:06:01,504 --> 02:06:02,891
him out right now.

2062
02:06:02,891 --> 02:06:04,099
TRAVIS: Knock him out, or--?

2063
02:06:04,099 --> 02:06:06,532
MATT: At which point, he turns around going,
"Ugh."

2064
02:06:06,532 --> 02:06:07,864
LAURA: Knock him out!

2065
02:06:07,864 --> 02:06:16,640
MATT: You know what, go ahead and roll an attack.
It's going to be surprise because he currently is

2066
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:19,007
not aware of the situation, so it's auto-crit.

2067
02:06:19,007 --> 02:06:22,436
LIAM: Oh, advantage, all right. Well, that's
better. 22.

2068
02:06:22,436 --> 02:06:24,315
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll.

2069
02:06:24,315 --> 02:06:41,555
LIAM: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a 13, 16,
that's still spinning, (counting), 26. 26 total.

2070
02:06:41,555 --> 02:06:47,998
MATT: Did you double that from the surprise?
Because he wasn't even prepared.

2071
02:06:47,998 --> 02:06:49,927
LIAM: No, so, uh, okay, so--

2072
02:06:49,927 --> 02:06:52,346
MATT: It's enough, if you double it. As long as
you're over 40, he's down.

2073
02:06:52,346 --> 02:06:53,571
LIAM: Yeah, it would be 40-something.

2074
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:57,427
MATT: Yeah, so. He goes out. A little dwarven
pile. He's out.

2075
02:06:57,427 --> 02:07:01,074
LAURA: Tie him up. I don't want him waking up and
running back to the dragon.

2076
02:07:01,074 --> 02:07:02,468
TRAVIS: You know how you solve that?

2077
02:07:02,468 --> 02:07:06,076
LAURA: I understand that, Grog. Maybe we should
just tie him up.

2078
02:07:06,076 --> 02:07:07,039
SAM: Tie him up.

2079
02:07:07,039 --> 02:07:08,270
MATT: Okay.

2080
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:12,790
LAURA: Tie him up and tie him up to a big stone so
he can't get up and run even if he--

2081
02:07:12,790 --> 02:07:14,733
MATT: Okay, so you guys take a moment to go ahead
and--

2082
02:07:14,733 --> 02:07:16,950
TALIESIN: Bow. Tie him in a little bow.

2083
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:21,858
MATT: Little bow, little dwarven bow? Okay. You
find a large piece of broken stone that was part

2084
02:07:21,858 --> 02:07:26,430
of the building's base floor structure and you tie
it around in multiple ways where he's going to

2085
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:31,014
have a hard time getting out, especially in his
current mindspace when he comes to consciousness.

2086
02:07:31,014 --> 02:07:33,014
The rain's still pouring down. He's soaked.

2087
02:07:33,014 --> 02:07:35,788
LAURA: Now.

2088
02:07:35,788 --> 02:07:44,279
MATT: All right. You guys gather around the hidden
hatch in the floor of Gilmore's room, and we're

2089
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:45,864
going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom
break.

2090
02:07:45,864 --> 02:07:47,128
ALL: Oh!

2091
02:07:47,128 --> 02:07:50,960
MATT: (laughs) A quick one. We'll take a few
minutes, get right back into this because we do

2092
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:55,321
have Critmas tonight. We want to make sure we get
as much done before we have to leave. So let's do

2093
02:07:55,321 --> 02:07:57,552
this. See you guys in a minute.

2094
02:07:57,552 --> 02:19:01,022
[break]

2095
02:19:01,022 --> 02:19:08,615
MATT: Welcome back everyone! So, as Liam here
brings up our wondrous Pike, we'll go ahead and

2096
02:19:08,615 --> 02:19:11,661
hop back into the game in just a minute, but I did
want to say two things. One, we have this

2097
02:19:11,661 --> 02:19:17,889
evening's winner for our giveaway, so a big
congratulations to one of my favorite recent

2098
02:19:17,889 --> 02:19:21,071
chatroom names: congrats to JarFullOfFarts.

2099
02:19:21,071 --> 02:19:23,609
(laughter)

2100
02:19:23,609 --> 02:19:27,513
MATT: You are our giveaway winner. I love you,
Internet, for allowing me to say these sentences.

2101
02:19:27,513 --> 02:19:29,112
It's a wonderful experience.

2102
02:19:29,112 --> 02:19:30,999
TRAVIS: Jar full of farts!

2103
02:19:30,999 --> 02:19:36,015
MATT: Also, I want to give a shout-out to a friend
of the show who's been helping stream on their end

2104
02:19:36,015 --> 02:19:40,584
as well, hosting us on their channel, and we've
had a good back-and-forth. "Rated E with Elspeth"

2105
02:19:40,584 --> 02:19:43,622
has been a really awesome supporter of the show.
Go check her out, give her a follow if you have

2106
02:19:43,622 --> 02:19:49,627
the opportunity. Thank you very much, by the way,
for helping support us. So, yay! All right, so!

2107
02:19:49,627 --> 02:19:55,176
Getting back in here. As the rain now continues to
pour down from above the open, clouded sky of

2108
02:19:55,176 --> 02:20:06,734
Emon, you reach down and pull open the false latch
on top of this open, hidden compartment beneath

2109
02:20:06,734 --> 02:20:15,438
the remnants of Gilmore's room. You look down into
a dark, low-lit interior, and what appears to be a

2110
02:20:15,438 --> 02:20:22,816
figure who rushes up very, very quickly and stops.
And you hear a voice from within the darkness,

2111
02:20:22,816 --> 02:20:29,532
just out of view from your position, that says,
"Whoever you are, leave! Run away or I swear I'll

2112
02:20:29,532 --> 02:20:31,100
"kill you!"

2113
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:32,232
MARISHA: Sherri.

2114
02:20:32,232 --> 02:20:33,405
LAURA: Sherri?

2115
02:20:33,405 --> 02:20:39,813
MATT: You look down and it doesn't appear to be
Sherri. It's a woman, frazzled hair. You can't

2116
02:20:39,813 --> 02:20:43,193
make out the details of her expression, but she's
holding this blade in front.

2117
02:20:43,193 --> 02:20:44,608
LAURA: Don't attack!

2118
02:20:44,608 --> 02:20:46,427
SAM: Sherri, it's us!

2119
02:20:46,427 --> 02:20:49,544
LAURA: Did you work here? We're looking for
Gilmore.

2120
02:20:49,544 --> 02:20:53,284
MATT: Looks past her shoulder. "Sherri?"

2121
02:20:53,284 --> 02:21:00,825
MATT: And you see Sherri now approaches, her hair
frazzled. She looks like she's covered in soot,

2122
02:21:00,825 --> 02:21:07,972
and actually has suffered some minor burns on part
of her arm and the side of her face a little bit,

2123
02:21:07,972 --> 02:21:13,439
and she steps into the little bit of light at the
bottom of the shaft and looks up and goes, "My

2124
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:20,667
"god. Come in, quick. Please." And she ushers you
down into this area.

2125
02:21:20,667 --> 02:21:22,134
MARISHA: I drop Minxie form.

2126
02:21:22,134 --> 02:21:28,858
MATT: Okay. As you guys all head down inside, this
is a relatively small chamber, maybe 20 feet by 20

2127
02:21:28,858 --> 02:21:36,175
feet. There's a couple of small chairs, and there
are a few metal rods that are bolted into the

2128
02:21:36,175 --> 02:21:40,765
stonework leading down as a ladder that you can
climb down. This is obviously a hidden compartment

2129
02:21:40,765 --> 02:21:48,433
that Gilmore uses to go up and down. You get a
better view now. It is Sherri there. Trinket,

2130
02:21:48,433 --> 02:21:54,452
unfortunately, at this moment, cannot make his way
down into this, so looks at you (bear grunts).

2131
02:21:54,452 --> 02:21:56,608
Looks around--

2132
02:21:56,608 --> 02:22:00,194
LAURA: Stay and guard the unconscious fucks.

2133
02:22:00,194 --> 02:22:03,867
MATT: (bear grunts) and sets into a defensive
position now looking out at the rest.

2134
02:22:03,867 --> 02:22:09,309
LAURA: If they start to wake up, sit on them! Or
kill them, if necessary.

2135
02:22:09,309 --> 02:22:12,772
MATT: Gives a nod, and stands there in the pouring
rain, soaking through Trinket. The armor

2136
02:22:12,772 --> 02:22:18,086
ting-ting-ting-ting-ting, ting-ing off the armor.
Staying there, keeping guard. As you all climb

2137
02:22:18,086 --> 02:22:25,859
down, you notice next to Sherri a very frazzled
and harrowed-looking-- the woman who was holding

2138
02:22:25,859 --> 02:22:32,269
the dagger in front. Her clothing is very, very
nice, though currently torn, and filthy. This is

2139
02:22:32,269 --> 02:22:34,256
Empress Salda Tal'Dorei.

2140
02:22:34,256 --> 02:22:35,605
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2141
02:22:35,605 --> 02:22:36,963
SAM: Wait, what, who?

2142
02:22:36,963 --> 02:22:39,032
MATT: Empress Salda Tal'Dorei, the wife of Uriel.

2143
02:22:39,032 --> 02:22:44,098
LAURA: Empress! Is Uriel down here? Did you make
it out? The children!

2144
02:22:44,098 --> 02:22:48,930
MATT: She puts her blade away. She looks over her
shoulder. "The children--" She puts her hand to

2145
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:53,565
the side and you can see in the back room, which,
now you can see, there is a teleportation circle

2146
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:58,161
that is slowly lit on the bottom of the floor
within this room.

2147
02:22:58,161 --> 02:23:00,408
MARISHA: What was her first name again? Empress
what?

2148
02:23:00,408 --> 02:23:01,366
MATT: Salda.

2149
02:23:01,366 --> 02:23:02,845
MARISHA: Esalda? With an E?

2150
02:23:02,845 --> 02:23:11,866
MATT: Salda. S-A-L-D-A. She looks over and you can
see her three kids, Odessa, Illya, and Gren, two

2151
02:23:11,866 --> 02:23:18,494
daughters and son, are all sitting in the corner,
talking to each other. They look like how children

2152
02:23:18,494 --> 02:23:22,092
deal in these type of situations. They're talking
and playing games and trying to distract

2153
02:23:22,092 --> 02:23:27,316
themselves. But as soon as you guys all walk in,
they look over, quietly, and their faces brighten

2154
02:23:27,316 --> 02:23:31,603
up at the arrival of somebody new, and they
recognize you as you begin to step into the low

2155
02:23:31,603 --> 02:23:41,481
light of the chamber. Salda then puts her hand
down and says, "I don't believe my husband made

2156
02:23:41,481 --> 02:23:47,413
"it. But we're alive."

2157
02:23:47,413 --> 02:23:49,694
LIAM: Did you see him fall?

2158
02:23:49,694 --> 02:23:59,177
MATT: "No." And she looks over into the far
corner. You can see, amongst the pile of rags and

2159
02:23:59,177 --> 02:24:05,682
stuff, there is one long pile of dark, crushed
velvet blue in the corner, with a small puddle of

2160
02:24:05,682 --> 02:24:13,767
crimson under it. "He saved us." And, glancing
over in the corner, you can now see the shape of

2161
02:24:13,767 --> 02:24:22,110
Gilmore, slumped in the corner, arm draped over
his midsection, head down to the side, in the

2162
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:23,560
center of that pool.

2163
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:27,919
LIAM: I run over, I run over. Is he awake? Is he
alive? I've got my hand under his chin. Is he alive?

2164
02:24:27,919 --> 02:24:40,724
MATT: You reach over and touch Gilmore's face, and
it is cold with sweat, but it's feverish sweat.

2165
02:24:40,724 --> 02:24:45,852
There is a very, very strong fever in his body,
and there's beads of sweat down the face, and as

2166
02:24:45,852 --> 02:24:50,671
you look down you can see where the arm is holding
there is blood soaked into the robe. You can see

2167
02:24:50,671 --> 02:24:58,313
parts of the robe right now are currently--
elements of it are burned and charred. You can see

2168
02:24:58,313 --> 02:25:03,248
parts of it scraped away. Gilmore's looking pretty
rough.

2169
02:25:03,248 --> 02:25:05,633
LIAM: I pull him in. Pike, Pike, Pike! Keyleth!
Come over here!

2170
02:25:05,633 --> 02:25:07,088
MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

2171
02:25:07,088 --> 02:25:09,902
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Cure Wounds.

2172
02:25:09,902 --> 02:25:15,991
LIAM: It's going to be all right. Pike is here,
it's going to be all right, it's going to be all

2173
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:23,717
right. Gil? Is there any consciousness?

2174
02:25:23,717 --> 02:25:27,141
MARISHA: I mean, I can try and assist you, Pike,
with Cure Wounds. That's all I have right now.

2175
02:25:27,141 --> 02:25:31,177
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, is he conscious?

2176
02:25:31,177 --> 02:25:36,414
MATT: No, unconscious. Unconscious, and looking--

2177
02:25:36,414 --> 02:25:37,978
MARISHA: Fading fast?

2178
02:25:37,978 --> 02:25:41,156
LAURA: Can you, like, Greater Restoration? I mean,
what's the best cure you can do, Pike?

2179
02:25:41,156 --> 02:25:43,030
ASHLEY: Okay okay okay.

2180
02:25:43,030 --> 02:25:47,111
MATT: You guys can both make medicine checks to
try and put him in a position where he would be

2181
02:25:47,111 --> 02:25:49,587
more susceptible to healing.

2182
02:25:49,587 --> 02:25:51,371
LAURA: 22?

2183
02:25:51,371 --> 02:25:54,310
ASHLEY: I can use a sixth level, and Heal.

2184
02:25:54,310 --> 02:25:56,153
MATT: Use the spell Heal?

2185
02:25:56,153 --> 02:25:57,282
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2186
02:25:57,282 --> 02:26:00,044
MARISHA: And I did a 16 on my Medicine check, with
her 22.

2187
02:26:00,044 --> 02:26:07,311
MATT: Okay. So you guys take a moment, you dress
the wounds best you can, and put him in a position

2188
02:26:07,311 --> 02:26:13,533
where Pike, as you bring forward, you grab your
holy symbol, and clutching it between both your

2189
02:26:13,533 --> 02:26:21,577
hands very tightly, you kneel down in front of the
slowly fading body of Gilmore. You can see the

2190
02:26:21,577 --> 02:26:26,030
shiver occasionally, instinctually in his
unconsciousness, and you reach out and touch him,

2191
02:26:26,030 --> 02:26:32,628
and as you do, the warm light of Sarenrae fills
your torso, travels through your arms, and into

2192
02:26:32,628 --> 02:26:38,075
the body of Gilmore. His arms fall to his side,
limp, as the warmth swells up into the torso, and

2193
02:26:38,075 --> 02:26:43,644
for a second, as the outside of the robe that you
saw torn open opens up, you can see now the

2194
02:26:43,644 --> 02:26:51,384
hideous gash that has currently torn through his
abdomen. As the warmth spreads through the body,

2195
02:26:51,384 --> 02:26:59,563
and the light visually shows the horrible, jagged
nature of this wound, the wound stitches itself up

2196
02:26:59,563 --> 02:27:07,280
and you can see it close, leaving but the tiniest
of scar across. The blood itself all still caked

2197
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:12,086
into the material, but the wound is now closed. As
you pull your hands back, you can see Gilmore's

2198
02:27:12,086 --> 02:27:16,355
body, which has, from the sheer power of the Heal
spell, has actually been elevated a few inches off

2199
02:27:16,355 --> 02:27:21,513
the ground, and then clatters to the ground as the
spell finishes, and you can see he shivers for a

2200
02:27:21,513 --> 02:27:25,872
second, he curls over. (pained grunt)

2201
02:27:25,872 --> 02:27:28,437
LIAM: I pull him into my lap, and hold onto him.

2202
02:27:28,437 --> 02:27:36,599
MATT: At this point, Sherri instinctively goes,
"Is he all right? Is he all right?" She pulls out

2203
02:27:36,599 --> 02:27:38,005
her glasses, puts them on.

2204
02:27:38,005 --> 02:27:40,849
LIAM: I think so, I think so.

2205
02:27:40,849 --> 02:27:43,243
MATT: "Who's this one? What is he doing here?"

2206
02:27:43,243 --> 02:27:48,985
SAM: He's a friend, he fought with us. He's not
corrupted by the dragon's influence.

2207
02:27:48,985 --> 02:27:52,615
MATT: "I'd like to know your name, orcish sir."

2208
02:27:52,615 --> 02:27:54,271
SAM: It's really cool.

2209
02:27:54,271 --> 02:27:58,652
JASON: I'm Garthok. I bow. I bow.

2210
02:27:58,652 --> 02:28:05,445
MATT: She gives you a sideways glance. "Keep your
distance. I don't trust you yet."

2211
02:28:05,445 --> 02:28:12,271
And she turns back around towards Gilmore. As
you're holding him there, the children at this

2212
02:28:12,271 --> 02:28:19,695
point are very quiet and sitting at his foot as
you all gather around this corner. A minute passes

2213
02:28:19,695 --> 02:28:23,385
in silence. Another minute passes.

2214
02:28:23,385 --> 02:28:29,987
LIAM: Smoothing his hair out. Hey. Hey.

2215
02:28:29,987 --> 02:28:35,528
MATT: His body is-- the stillness is maintained,
but you can still feel the heartbeat, and you can

2216
02:28:35,528 --> 02:28:40,181
feel the pulse of blood through the body from
holding the shoulders. And then, from that

2217
02:28:40,181 --> 02:28:48,388
silence, you hear, (weak coughing). And the mouth
opens, and the eyes begin to loll open, and the

2218
02:28:48,388 --> 02:28:58,207
irises begin to try and find some point of focus,
and Gilmore slowly lolls the head back up and

2219
02:28:58,207 --> 02:29:02,563
looks into your face and smiles, instinctually,
little blood at the corner of his mouth, and he

2220
02:29:02,563 --> 02:29:11,560
looks up at you. "Well. That's always what I assumed
I'd see in my last moments." (chuckles)

2221
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:13,490
LIAM: Bad day, huh?

2222
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:16,967
MATT: "Ah... strangely enough, I'm pretty sure I've
had worse."

2223
02:29:16,967 --> 02:29:19,406
LAURA: No offense, darling, but you look like
shit.

2224
02:29:19,406 --> 02:29:24,796
MATT: (laughs) "We can't have that, can we?"
(coughs) Lifts his hand and begins to try and cast

2225
02:29:24,796 --> 02:29:29,682
a spell. You can see a bit of arcane
Prestidigitation begin to try and muster, and he

2226
02:29:29,682 --> 02:29:32,783
coughs, and the magic sputters and fades.

2227
02:29:32,783 --> 02:29:34,433
LIAM: Give it time.

2228
02:29:34,433 --> 02:29:47,930
MATT: "So, either we're all dead or we're all
alive. I'd like an answer."

2229
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:49,306
LAURA: Alive.

2230
02:29:49,306 --> 02:29:55,018
MATT: "Good, I was hoping you'd say that.
(relieved chuckle) I was so worried about you all.

2231
02:29:55,018 --> 02:29:56,965
"I went back for you."

2232
02:29:56,965 --> 02:29:59,092
MARISHA: What? We were so worried about you!

2233
02:29:59,092 --> 02:30:01,437
TALIESIN: We're glad you came here.

2234
02:30:01,437 --> 02:30:10,689
MATT: "I'm sorry. When they attacked, my instinct
was to grab the children. I got who I could, but

2235
02:30:10,689 --> 02:30:20,814
"Uriel pushed me away. He was trying to get others
out of the fray."

2236
02:30:20,814 --> 02:30:22,705
LAURA: Did you see him fall?

2237
02:30:22,705 --> 02:30:27,382
MATT: "I didn't see him fall, but I went back, and
I found him fallen."

2238
02:30:27,382 --> 02:30:31,648
SAM: His body?

2239
02:30:31,648 --> 02:30:43,346
MATT: "What was left of it. I brought back Salda
and the children. I brought back Asum, and that

2240
02:30:43,346 --> 02:30:49,742
"abrasive dragon girl. I don't know where they are
right now."

2241
02:30:49,742 --> 02:30:54,289
And Salda chimes in and goes, "They both actually,
they left. They went topsoil to try and find other

2242
02:30:54,289 --> 02:30:58,840
"survivors. I told them not to, I told them to
stay, but they're assumedly off in the city

2243
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:01,575
"somewhere, trying to make sense of all this."

2244
02:31:01,575 --> 02:31:05,294
TALIESIN: We're trying to collect people at our
keep.

2245
02:31:05,294 --> 02:31:09,378
MARISHA: We've turned it into a safe haven.

2246
02:31:09,378 --> 02:31:17,436
MATT: "Well. That's kind of you. That's good of
you. That's probably one of the only safe places

2247
02:31:17,436 --> 02:31:20,650
"in the city right now." (coughs)

2248
02:31:20,650 --> 02:31:25,460
LIAM: Can you do anything?

2249
02:31:25,460 --> 02:31:30,126
LAURA: I mean, I can cast Cure Wounds on him to
try to help out at all. Will it help? I mean, you

2250
02:31:30,126 --> 02:31:31,508
know, more than I would.

2251
02:31:31,508 --> 02:31:39,787
MATT: "Whatever your fine angel of Sarenrae did I
think will hold me fine for now." And he smiles

2252
02:31:39,787 --> 02:31:45,818
and gives a very, very half-hearted wink towards
Pike. "Thank you."

2253
02:31:45,818 --> 02:31:49,459
ASHLEY: Welcome.

2254
02:31:49,459 --> 02:31:52,188
MATT: "Thank you dearly."

2255
02:31:52,188 --> 02:31:55,402
LIAM: You've certainly earned your name today.

2256
02:31:55,402 --> 02:32:03,330
MATT: "I could have saved more. I couldn't find
you, I couldn't-- I looked."

2257
02:32:03,330 --> 02:32:05,930
MARISHA: We're so sorry.

2258
02:32:05,930 --> 02:32:08,863
MATT: "Oh, no, I, you-- "

2259
02:32:08,863 --> 02:32:10,518
TALIESIN: We were hard to find.

2260
02:32:10,518 --> 02:32:15,244
MATT: "I figured you would be taking care of
yourself. I went-- (chuckles) I went to the dragon

2261
02:32:15,244 --> 02:32:21,594
"then, just in case you had decided to be your
usual foolish selves and run into hell itself."

2262
02:32:21,594 --> 02:32:26,619
LAURA: Perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him?
(chuckles) That would have been stupid, huh?

2263
02:32:26,619 --> 02:32:30,703
SAM: Yes. Very.

2264
02:32:30,703 --> 02:32:34,653
LAURA: Gilmore, we called for you. I'm sorry we
didn't wait.

2265
02:32:34,653 --> 02:32:39,626
MATT: "No. I'm glad you didn't. You may not be
here."

2266
02:32:39,626 --> 02:32:45,572
LIAM: Did you see any others from the Council?
Anyone else?

2267
02:32:45,572 --> 02:32:55,215
MATT: "Well." And he leans forward, and sits up
out of your lap for a second to look at the rest

2268
02:32:55,215 --> 02:33:15,084
of you. "There are quite a few dead,
unfortunately. Brom Goldhand didn't make it. Most

2269
02:33:15,084 --> 02:33:25,818
"of the guards are gone. Half, if not more, of the
Cloudtop District. Killed by the poisonous fume

2270
02:33:25,818 --> 02:33:30,278
"that took the entire area so suddenly."

2271
02:33:30,278 --> 02:33:33,778
LAURA: Poisonous fume?

2272
02:33:33,778 --> 02:33:44,974
MATT: "From the initial dragon attack. We've been
staying here for safety's sake. I don't know how

2273
02:33:44,974 --> 02:33:53,167
"long I've been out. Could we perhaps make our way
towards your place as well?"

2274
02:33:53,167 --> 02:33:55,534
LAURA: It would be smart.

2275
02:33:55,534 --> 02:34:03,789
SAM: Is there any point to searching for more
Council members or allies before we go?

2276
02:34:03,789 --> 02:34:11,218
LAURA: Anyone that was alive that you saw?

2277
02:34:11,218 --> 02:34:18,725
MATT: "I mean, there were many that were alive by
the time I returned. They were all kneeling before

2278
02:34:18,725 --> 02:34:27,058
"the beast. It's very interesting that when given
the face of death before you how quickly folks are

2279
02:34:27,058 --> 02:34:37,638
"willing to stay alive at whatever cost of morality
and sense of society. I don't blame them. I mean,

2280
02:34:37,638 --> 02:34:43,406
"what other alternative is there, but to stay alive
and hope that others come and save them from this

2281
02:34:43,406 --> 02:34:50,261
"burden?" (coughs) And he coughs up a little blood
and wipes it from his chin.

2282
02:34:50,261 --> 02:35:01,352
LAURA: Does the Cinder King have mind control
abilities, or is he just super impressive?

2283
02:35:01,352 --> 02:35:09,685
MATT: "I think it's more that he's very persuasive
with his threat of how many did not fare this

2284
02:35:09,685 --> 02:35:18,979
"attack. I did get a good look at him, before
he-- well."

2285
02:35:18,979 --> 02:35:25,670
LIAM: He's ripped the heart out of this city.
Let's go.

2286
02:35:25,816 --> 02:35:27,696
MARISHA: Everything's gone.

2287
02:35:27,759 --> 02:35:30,205
SAM: When you saw him, did you see anything
important?

2288
02:35:30,205 --> 02:35:43,226
MATT: "I did notice in his chest, where the scales
of a dragon usually are uniform, there was an

2289
02:35:43,226 --> 02:35:54,905
"obfuscation of sorts, there was something
different about his armor. It was hard to make out

2290
02:35:54,905 --> 02:36:01,922
"the details in how fast we had a duel. I've never
dueled a dragon before! I've dueled a dragon now."

2291
02:36:01,922 --> 02:36:03,390
(laughs)

2292
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:05,416
LAURA: And fared quite well!

2293
02:36:05,416 --> 02:36:09,348
MATT: "No, I did not! I survived longer than I
hoped, and got out when I could."

2294
02:36:09,348 --> 02:36:11,507
JASON: A weak spot.

2295
02:36:11,507 --> 02:36:14,906
SAM: Yeah, did it look like scarring? From a
previous fight?

2296
02:36:14,906 --> 02:36:25,032
MATT: "I didn't get a very good look, but it
looked like there was a different material,

2297
02:36:25,032 --> 02:36:30,613
"something smooth and jagged. Something that pulsed
with power."

2298
02:36:30,613 --> 02:36:34,951
LIAM: Doesn't sound like a weak spot.

2299
02:36:34,951 --> 02:36:36,723
LAURA: That doesn't sound super good.

2300
02:36:36,723 --> 02:36:41,562
MATT: "I didn't get a terribly good look, nor do I
understand the nature of whatever it was, but--"

2301
02:36:41,562 --> 02:36:48,086
TALIESIN: It's the beginning of something.
Something to start thinking about.

2302
02:36:48,086 --> 02:36:49,424
MARISHA: What do you mean?

2303
02:36:49,424 --> 02:36:55,732
MATT: "Does anyone have any water? I'm a bit
parched."

2304
02:36:55,732 --> 02:36:59,794
TRAVIS: We got better than that, we got a potion.
And honestly, if we're going to be moving about on

2305
02:36:59,794 --> 02:37:03,979
the streets, I'd like you to not fall open like a
can of baked beans, if you don't mind.

2306
02:37:03,979 --> 02:37:16,293
MATT: (chuckles) "I'm not going to lie, I'm quite
touched by your concern, Grog. It's flattering."

2307
02:37:16,293 --> 02:37:20,695
(grunts) And he starts trying to stand up, and as
he does, Sherri rushes forward and grabs him.

2308
02:37:20,695 --> 02:37:22,635
LIAM: I'm under, too, I'm helping him up.

2309
02:37:22,635 --> 02:37:27,607
MATT: You get him up, and he's propping himself
up. What little strength he has, he's keeping

2310
02:37:27,607 --> 02:37:33,647
himself up, and keeping a smile through it all.
Even in this weakened state, still trying to

2311
02:37:33,647 --> 02:37:38,330
present the best of himself that he can. "All
right."

2312
02:37:38,330 --> 02:37:48,466
SAM: Gilmore, before we go, one more crazy
question: you're not a dragon, are you?

2313
02:37:48,466 --> 02:37:59,197
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, I wish I was. That would have
made this whole endeavor a little easier on my part."

2314
02:37:59,197 --> 02:38:02,178
SAM: All right.

2315
02:38:02,178 --> 02:38:06,812
MATT: "But if you find a way for me to become a
dragon, that would be sexy."

2316
02:38:06,812 --> 02:38:10,331
(laughter)

2317
02:38:10,331 --> 02:38:14,654
ASHLEY: Oh, Gilmore.

2318
02:38:14,654 --> 02:38:17,633
SAM: Should we teleport, or is there tunnels, or
how do we go?

2319
02:38:17,633 --> 02:38:22,379
LAURA: Could I have just a little bit of time?
Before we--

2320
02:38:22,379 --> 02:38:26,717
SAM: Oh, with Garthok? Or with Gilmore?

2321
02:38:26,717 --> 02:38:29,698
LAURA: Oh, up top. You know, I'll be right back.

2322
02:38:29,698 --> 02:38:31,208
SAM: You're going to go up there?

2323
02:38:31,208 --> 02:38:32,774
LAURA: Just for a second.

2324
02:38:32,774 --> 02:38:34,028
TRAVIS: All by yourself?

2325
02:38:34,028 --> 02:38:36,817
LAURA: I mean, if you guys want to join, if
anybody wants to come with me, but I'm going to

2326
02:38:36,817 --> 02:38:38,121
stealth like a motherfucker.

2327
02:38:38,121 --> 02:38:41,222
MARISHA: I mean, it seemed like we were heading
out? Are we heading out?

2328
02:38:41,222 --> 02:38:48,217
TALIESIN: I propose a plan. Let's get them back to
the secret passage. I think we should--

2329
02:38:48,217 --> 02:38:51,850
[no audio]

2330
02:38:51,850 --> 02:39:02,258
TALIESIN: One of the reasons why a government
allows something like the Clasp to exist in a city

2331
02:39:02,258 --> 02:39:09,881
like this is because it is a shadow infrastructure
that will survive an attack like this. It is an

2332
02:39:09,881 --> 02:39:18,573
infrastructure designed-- Grog, it's a bunch of
people who are really good at making money when

2333
02:39:18,573 --> 02:39:22,399
everything's working, and when everything stops
working, they get very angry and want to make

2334
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:23,786
everything work again.

2335
02:39:23,786 --> 02:39:25,395
TRAVIS: Yeah, I understand that.

2336
02:39:25,395 --> 02:39:33,395
TALIESIN: So we have a group of people who are
well-organized, with everything to gain by this

2337
02:39:33,395 --> 02:39:37,763
dragon leaving. They're ready, they're prepared,
they're probably more prepared than anybody else

2338
02:39:37,763 --> 02:39:45,687
would be. And they might be willing to help us.
They have tunnels, they have men, they have spies,

2339
02:39:45,687 --> 02:39:49,702
they have everything we need. Please tell me if
I'm wrong here.

2340
02:39:49,702 --> 02:39:52,983
JASON: You couldn't be more right.

2341
02:39:52,983 --> 02:39:56,431
TALIESIN: They might be the friends that we need
at this moment.

2342
02:39:56,431 --> 02:40:00,508
MATT: "I take it you're one of these underlings?"

2343
02:40:00,508 --> 02:40:05,515
JASON: I can't speak for the group, but I am a
member, yes.

2344
02:40:05,515 --> 02:40:07,040
LAURA: Would they listen to you?

2345
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,562
JASON: I'm sure they would.

2346
02:40:09,562 --> 02:40:11,351
LAURA: They don't like us very much.

2347
02:40:11,351 --> 02:40:19,343
JASON: A lot of us didn't like Mordeth either, so
more people like you than you may know.

2348
02:40:19,343 --> 02:40:21,415
LAURA: All right.

2349
02:40:21,415 --> 02:40:23,838
TRAVIS: Where do you want to go?

2350
02:40:23,838 --> 02:40:30,279
LAURA: I want to go get that fucking well full of
fucking loot. Magical items, gold, who knows what

2351
02:40:30,279 --> 02:40:31,557
could be in there that could help us?

2352
02:40:31,557 --> 02:40:34,713
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, you want to go steal
from Thordak?

2353
02:40:34,713 --> 02:40:40,526
LAURA: No no no! They never gave it to him. They
gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a well.

2354
02:40:40,526 --> 02:40:43,714
SAM: Because he told them to.

2355
02:40:43,714 --> 02:40:47,879
LAURA: No, they were going to get it all together
and give it to him, but they never gave it to him.

2356
02:40:47,879 --> 02:40:50,059
TRAVIS: They were keeping it. They were hiding it
away in one place.

2357
02:40:50,059 --> 02:40:55,062
TALIESIN: So, a small group goes and gets the gold
and the rest of us get Gilmore and the family to

2358
02:40:55,062 --> 02:40:56,245
the secret passage.

2359
02:40:56,245 --> 02:41:00,020
SAM: Last time we took a dragon's gold, five of
them showed up.

2360
02:41:00,020 --> 02:41:02,031
LAURA: The dragon doesn't know about the gold.

2361
02:41:02,031 --> 02:41:09,377
SAM: Don't you think the dragon knows everything
that's going on right now? I'm the spy here.

2362
02:41:09,377 --> 02:41:14,011
LAURA: If you're scared, then go with Gilmore. I'm
going to go get the gold.

2363
02:41:14,011 --> 02:41:16,334
TALIESIN: I would agree with getting the gold.

2364
02:41:16,334 --> 02:41:18,860
LAURA: Grog?

2365
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:20,419
TRAVIS: I'll go with the family.

2366
02:41:20,419 --> 02:41:24,156
LAURA: Gimme the Bag of Holding, then. Where am I
going to put all the gold?

2367
02:41:24,156 --> 02:41:25,747
TALIESIN: She's got a point.

2368
02:41:25,747 --> 02:41:29,549
MARISHA: Do you all remember the last time I told
you something was a terrible idea?

2369
02:41:29,549 --> 02:41:31,591
LAURA: I've got the Bag of Holding.

2370
02:41:31,591 --> 02:41:32,920
MARISHA: It was a few days ago--

2371
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:33,919
SAM: It was every time.

2372
02:41:33,919 --> 02:41:35,441
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all the time, really.

2373
02:41:35,441 --> 02:41:39,215
MARISHA: Right, right. This is probably another
one of those times.

2374
02:41:39,215 --> 02:41:43,418
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself and
anybody else joining me?

2375
02:41:43,418 --> 02:41:44,519
SAM: I'm coming too.

2376
02:41:44,519 --> 02:41:45,471
LAURA: Scanlan.

2377
02:41:45,471 --> 02:41:46,447
TRAVIS: Vax?

2378
02:41:46,447 --> 02:41:48,473
TALIESIN: I'll come-- wait, no, I should probably
go.

2379
02:41:48,473 --> 02:41:57,883
LIAM: I don't want to go, but I'm not leaving you.
And I hoist Gilmore onto Keyleth.

2380
02:41:57,883 --> 02:42:00,056
MATT: "Ah."

2381
02:42:00,056 --> 02:42:01,536
TALIESIN: We've got you.

2382
02:42:01,536 --> 02:42:03,695
MATT: "Hello." (chuckles)

2383
02:42:03,695 --> 02:42:05,084
MARISHA: Vax.

2384
02:42:05,084 --> 02:42:06,328
LIAM: I'm not happy.

2385
02:42:06,328 --> 02:42:09,291
LAURA: Well, then, don't be pissy about it.

2386
02:42:09,291 --> 02:42:11,252
LIAM: I'm not leaving you.

2387
02:42:11,252 --> 02:42:19,902
LAURA: We'll be right back. I mean, it's magic
shit! Gilmore, I'm going to get your shit back for you.

2388
02:42:19,902 --> 02:42:24,056
MARISHA: Remember the last time we went somewhere
to go get a big pile of shit?

2389
02:42:24,056 --> 02:42:31,807
MATT: "Good thing, because, well. I'm going to
need it to renovate this place a little." (laughs, coughs)

2390
02:42:31,807 --> 02:42:33,028
LAURA: Right?

2391
02:42:33,028 --> 02:42:34,222
TRAVIS: He's a fan of it.

2392
02:42:34,222 --> 02:42:36,098
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace on the three of us.
Stealth like a motherfucker.

2393
02:42:36,098 --> 02:42:37,228
SAM: Who's three? Us three?

2394
02:42:37,228 --> 02:42:40,205
LAURA: Yeah. Us three. Stealth out. It's like a
15-minute walk.

2395
02:42:40,205 --> 02:42:47,445
MARISHA: We were flanked here at Gilmore's Goods.
What makes you think that they're not going to

2396
02:42:47,445 --> 02:42:49,920
have a ton of people sitting there watching that
well?

2397
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:52,012
LAURA: I'm going to look out for that shit this
time.

2398
02:42:52,012 --> 02:42:56,052
MARISHA: Yeah, that, right. That's worked well in
the past.

2399
02:42:56,052 --> 02:43:00,892
JASON: The area where they're going, where the
well is. Is that closer to one of the entrances to

2400
02:43:00,892 --> 02:43:02,137
the Clasp?

2401
02:43:02,137 --> 02:43:05,402
MATT: The one you're going towards? In the
direction. It's a little bit past where you're

2402
02:43:05,402 --> 02:43:08,418
going so you'd have to double back to the
entrance, but it is totally a way to do it.

2403
02:43:08,418 --> 02:43:09,492
LAURA: Look, see?

2404
02:43:09,492 --> 02:43:10,962
SAM: Then we're all going to the same place.

2405
02:43:10,962 --> 02:43:12,076
LAURA: See? Look at this.

2406
02:43:12,076 --> 02:43:16,868
I'm going to stay separate from the group
so I can stealth a little bit better.

2407
02:43:16,868 --> 02:43:18,520
TRAVIS: Twins out in front.

2408
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:22,582
LAURA: I'm stealthing. Pass Without a Trace on all
of us, then.

2409
02:43:22,582 --> 02:43:26,394
MATT: Stealth checks from all those that are
heading towards the well.

2410
02:43:26,394 --> 02:43:29,571
LAURA: Are we all heading towards the well to jump
down to the Clasp, or is anybody going back

2411
02:43:29,571 --> 02:43:30,921
towards the Keep right now?

2412
02:43:30,921 --> 02:43:33,190
JASON: The well's farther or the Clasp entrance is
farther?

2413
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:37,198
MATT: The Clasp entrance is closer, the well is
further, so you actually go past it.

2414
02:43:37,198 --> 02:43:41,039
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. Hang on. We're all
going to the Clasp entrance?

2415
02:43:41,039 --> 02:43:42,492
MATT: That's up to you guys.

2416
02:43:42,492 --> 02:43:45,318
MARISHA: Which is in the same direction as our
keep? Because we have a crippled guy on our

2417
02:43:45,318 --> 02:43:46,767
shoulder.

2418
02:43:46,767 --> 02:43:48,914
TALIESIN: Yeah, we wanted to get the family and
Gilmore back to the keep first.

2419
02:43:48,914 --> 02:43:50,666
LAURA: And the kids. Get them back to the keep.

2420
02:43:50,666 --> 02:43:53,886
SAM: Can't you tree-shoot us, tree-shoot them
there?

2421
02:43:53,886 --> 02:43:59,010
MARISHA: I don't want to use that in case we need
to tree-shoot us to Vasselheim. Or somewhere.

2422
02:43:59,010 --> 02:44:00,329
TALIESIN: Let's hold that off.

2423
02:44:00,329 --> 02:44:04,797
TRAVIS: We're going to the Clasp entrance, right,
to go to the tunnels and all the network of shit

2424
02:44:04,797 --> 02:44:08,284
that we don't understand because they'll be allies
and the people that are going to stealth ahead are

2425
02:44:08,284 --> 02:44:09,554
going to go to the well?

2426
02:44:09,554 --> 02:44:11,663
LAURA: I don't think we should bring three children into
the Clasp.

2427
02:44:11,663 --> 02:44:15,161
TALIESIN: This was my thought, is we take
everybody who's down here, we get them back to the

2428
02:44:15,161 --> 02:44:17,161
castle. In the meantime--

2429
02:44:17,161 --> 02:44:18,462
SAM: Which castle? The keep?

2430
02:44:18,462 --> 02:44:22,034
TALIESIN: Keep. In the meantime, you get the
treasure. Once the treasure is gotten and they're

2431
02:44:22,034 --> 02:44:24,060
back in the keep, we get together and find the
Clasp.

2432
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:26,312
LAURA: Perfect plan! Let's go.

2433
02:44:26,312 --> 02:44:34,604
MARISHA: I grab Vax's hand and pull him back as
they pace away.

2434
02:44:34,604 --> 02:44:42,576
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys all find your way
outside of the remnants of Gilmore's facility, the

2435
02:44:42,576 --> 02:44:46,456
three children and Salda staying very close. She
keeps the children like right at her sides with her

2436
02:44:46,456 --> 02:44:51,504
arms around them, protectively. Sherri's at her
side as well with her blade out just in case, and

2437
02:44:51,504 --> 02:44:57,080
they're forming this circle around the remnants of
the Tal'Dorei family. As those of you continue to

2438
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:02,640
push forward, before you disappear, Keyleth grabs
and pulls you.

2439
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:03,956
LIAM: Splitting off?

2440
02:45:03,956 --> 02:45:04,959
MATT: Yeah.

2441
02:45:04,959 --> 02:45:06,959
LIAM: I have to go.

2442
02:45:06,959 --> 02:45:10,847
MARISHA: What? Don't, wait! Vax, Vax, listen to
me.

2443
02:45:10,847 --> 02:45:13,052
LIAM: I pull away and go.

2444
02:45:13,052 --> 02:45:17,518
MARISHA: No, Vax! God fuckin', you--

2445
02:45:17,518 --> 02:45:26,688
MATT: As Vax quite literally disappears from your
sight after a few steps, vanishing into the shadow

2446
02:45:26,688 --> 02:45:27,719
of the rubble.

2447
02:45:27,719 --> 02:45:33,912
MARISHA: I go through to my earring. Vax, talk her
out of it. This is not the time to be looting for

2448
02:45:33,912 --> 02:45:39,112
treasure. That's only ever brought us grief. Talk
her out of it.

2449
02:45:39,112 --> 02:45:48,727
LAURA: 29, 39 on stealth for me.

2450
02:45:48,727 --> 02:45:50,068
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

2451
02:45:50,068 --> 02:45:51,192
SAM: 28.

2452
02:45:51,192 --> 02:45:52,445
LAURA: Plus ten?

2453
02:45:52,445 --> 02:45:53,898
MARISHA: Who's taking the kids home?

2454
02:45:53,898 --> 02:45:57,149
LAURA: Trinket's going with you guys, by the way.

2455
02:45:57,149 --> 02:45:58,465
LIAM: 42.

2456
02:45:58,465 --> 02:46:02,718
MARISHA: You're coming with us?

2457
02:46:02,718 --> 02:46:05,740
TRAVIS: I'm going, yeah, with the kids.

2458
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:12,895
MARISHA: With the kids? I'll cast Pass Without a
Trace on us. On team back-to-the-keep.

2459
02:46:12,895 --> 02:46:20,273
MATT: Okay. I'll have you guys roll a stealth
check as well. Okay. And you're heading with them

2460
02:46:20,273 --> 02:46:21,099
to the--

2461
02:46:21,099 --> 02:46:23,514
JASON: So, well. In what direction is the keep,
because--

2462
02:46:23,514 --> 02:46:26,824
MATT: The keep is southward. It's away from the
entrance to the Clasp.

2463
02:46:26,824 --> 02:46:30,429
JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his first priority is
trying to--

2464
02:46:30,429 --> 02:46:32,317
SAM: Garthok's Dilemma is a great book.

2465
02:46:32,317 --> 02:46:33,957
(laughter)

2466
02:46:33,957 --> 02:46:37,214
LAURA: Do what you got to do, Garthok.

2467
02:46:37,214 --> 02:46:39,151
JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his--

2468
02:46:39,151 --> 02:46:40,804
TRAVIS: Don't tell us, just do it!

2469
02:46:40,804 --> 02:46:45,393
JASON: He's got to go towards the Clasp because
he's trying to make sure they're still alive.

2470
02:46:45,393 --> 02:46:49,534
MATT: As you guys divide, Garthok still stands
there for a second looking back and forth,

2471
02:46:49,534 --> 02:46:54,482
conflicted by this. Vex, you pick up on this as
you're walking away.

2472
02:46:54,482 --> 02:46:58,013
LAURA: What're you doing?

2473
02:46:58,013 --> 02:47:06,722
JASON: I have to go, I have to find the Clasp. It's my
number one priority. It's why I sought you guys

2474
02:47:06,722 --> 02:47:08,801
out in the first place.

2475
02:47:08,801 --> 02:47:10,696
MARISHA: We understand. We've got the kids.

2476
02:47:10,696 --> 02:47:14,695
JASON: I'll meet you at the Clasp entrance.

2477
02:47:14,695 --> 02:47:15,846
LAURA: Where do you want us to meet you?

2478
02:47:15,846 --> 02:47:17,684
SAM: Can you tell us where the entrance is? Do we
know where the entrance is?

2479
02:47:17,684 --> 02:47:18,929
LAURA: Which entrance?

2480
02:47:18,929 --> 02:47:25,456
JASON: The entrance that I know exists is in the
same direction as the treasure, so I will travel

2481
02:47:25,456 --> 02:47:29,504
with you until we get to the entrance, which
hopefully is there and not destroyed.

2482
02:47:29,504 --> 02:47:31,757
LAURA: Better fucking stealth like a
motherfucker.

2483
02:47:31,757 --> 02:47:35,807
JASON: Ready. 14.

2484
02:47:35,807 --> 02:47:38,180
MATT: Plus ten. 24 for stealth.

2485
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:39,299
MARISHA: Are we all rolling stealth?

2486
02:47:39,299 --> 02:47:41,131
MATT: Yeah. Everyone is. Plus ten.

2487
02:47:41,131 --> 02:47:42,254
TRAVIS: 27.

2488
02:47:42,254 --> 02:47:43,380
SAM: Pike!

2489
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:47,540
ASHLEY: Yup. I rolled a 16.

2490
02:47:47,540 --> 02:47:49,818
LAURA: Yeah, 26 stealth, Pike!

2491
02:47:49,818 --> 02:47:51,900
ASHLEY: That was at disadvantage, too.

2492
02:47:51,900 --> 02:47:53,309
MATT: Nice. Well-played.

2493
02:47:53,309 --> 02:47:54,350
MARISHA: 25.

2494
02:47:54,350 --> 02:47:55,279
TALIESIN: 31.

2495
02:47:55,279 --> 02:48:03,589
MATT: All right. So as you guys split off in the
rain, occasionally you hear the slam of something

2496
02:48:03,589 --> 02:48:08,307
heavy echoing in the distance from the Cloudtop
and a guttural yell of frustration.

2497
02:48:08,307 --> 02:48:11,603
LAURA: I'm keeping my eye out for any kind of
anything in front of us.

2498
02:48:11,603 --> 02:48:20,153
MATT: Right. You're not sure what or why
anything's happening, but twice during your

2499
02:48:20,153 --> 02:48:27,926
journey northward for this, you hear a low growl
or roar and there's a flash of fire from over the

2500
02:48:27,926 --> 02:48:37,923
wall. You don't know what happened. As you guys
push, darting through the alleys, for the team

2501
02:48:37,923 --> 02:48:42,513
that's going for the entrance to the Clasp, you
lead them into--

2502
02:48:42,513 --> 02:48:44,213
JASON: A trap! Booyah!

2503
02:48:44,213 --> 02:48:47,714
(laughter)

2504
02:48:47,714 --> 02:48:49,425
LAURA: You motherfucker!

2505
02:48:49,425 --> 02:48:50,977
MATT: That would've been amazing.

2506
02:48:50,977 --> 02:48:54,985
JASON: I've been waiting to trap you for three
hours!

2507
02:48:54,985 --> 02:49:04,997
MATT: You lead them into a wine cellar that is
locked over with a series of chains. You go

2508
02:49:04,997 --> 02:49:09,977
forward and you know where there are two triggers
for two traps that are part of that entrance. You

2509
02:49:09,977 --> 02:49:17,300
go ahead and deftly disable both traps through
hidden mechanisms. You go ahead and pull on one of

2510
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:22,466
the chains and it extends magically as you pull on
it, almost infinite, or at least for a period of

2511
02:49:22,466 --> 02:49:27,420
time. You find the right link, you activate it,
keeping this all hidden to yourself, because this

2512
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:30,749
is what you're trained to do, and the chain
disables itself or breaks into three different

2513
02:49:30,749 --> 02:49:35,431
pieces. You then open up the two parts of this
cellar, lead them down into a regular wine cellar.

2514
02:49:35,431 --> 02:49:38,386
It's very dark. There's almost no light down there
other than what's pouring in through this

2515
02:49:38,386 --> 02:49:42,418
entrance. It looks like most of the wine bottles
here have been taken out. It's empty other than a

2516
02:49:42,418 --> 02:49:52,528
few small bottles that are set up in this vast
criss-cross of wooden racks, and you go ahead and

2517
02:49:52,528 --> 02:49:58,353
walk over to one of the barrels and lift up the
top of a heavy, heavy whiskey barrel. Pulling off

2518
02:49:58,353 --> 02:50:02,663
the top of the barrel, the barrel itself does not
move as he's wrestling with it. As he does, he

2519
02:50:02,663 --> 02:50:07,101
climbs into and stops for a second, looks around,
and shows you guys that this barrel itself is

2520
02:50:07,101 --> 02:50:09,913
actually a chute ladder that leads downward into a
subterranean base.

2521
02:50:09,913 --> 02:50:13,658
LAURA: Got it. Now is all that shit up top
going to be open for us when we come back?

2522
02:50:13,658 --> 02:50:18,371
JASON: I could wait for you here or maybe come
with you and get some of that treasure.

2523
02:50:18,371 --> 02:50:21,454
LAURA: It's going to be a while, you know. We've
got to get the treasure and go back to the Keep

2524
02:50:21,454 --> 02:50:22,480
and come back--

2525
02:50:22,480 --> 02:50:23,879
SAM: You can come with us. You can come with us.

2526
02:50:23,879 --> 02:50:26,663
LAURA: I mean, it's up to you. I know you need to
talk to the Clasp, so if you need to talk to them

2527
02:50:26,663 --> 02:50:28,011
and let them know we're on our way--

2528
02:50:28,011 --> 02:50:29,104
SAM: Enough treasure to go around.

2529
02:50:29,104 --> 02:50:30,707
JASON: I could definitely let them know.

2530
02:50:30,707 --> 02:50:32,429
LAURA: It's up to you.

2531
02:50:32,429 --> 02:50:36,489
JASON: I'm relieved that it's there and not
destroyed, so.

2532
02:50:36,489 --> 02:50:41,026
MATT: Okay. So, you guys, now knowing where the
entrance is, you make your way back out. You close

2533
02:50:41,026 --> 02:50:46,125
the cellar and make your way towards where this
dwarf's general description of the well is. I want

2534
02:50:46,125 --> 02:50:47,643
you to make an investigation check.

2535
02:50:47,643 --> 02:50:48,790
SAM: All of us?

2536
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:49,896
MATT: All of you.

2537
02:50:49,896 --> 02:50:53,165
SAM: 27.

2538
02:50:53,165 --> 02:50:54,681
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2539
02:50:54,681 --> 02:50:56,626
LAURA: You're not with us.

2540
02:50:56,626 --> 02:50:57,898
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought he said everybody.

2541
02:50:57,898 --> 02:51:01,195
MATT: Sorry, everybody in that group. But
congratulations!

2542
02:51:01,195 --> 02:51:02,589
MARISHA: Oh no!

2543
02:51:02,589 --> 02:51:09,845
TRAVIS: I escort the kids expertly. I'm a champ at
babysitting.

2544
02:51:09,845 --> 02:51:14,720
MATT: You've had a Percy game today. You've had a
lot of twenties.

2545
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,091
LAURA: 19.

2546
02:51:16,091 --> 02:51:16,987
ASHLEY: 20.

2547
02:51:16,987 --> 02:51:17,829
JASON: 14.

2548
02:51:17,829 --> 02:51:18,767
LIAM: 11.

2549
02:51:18,767 --> 02:51:24,294
MATT: 11. So you guys take about 20 minutes,
wandering the area unable to find really which

2550
02:51:24,294 --> 02:51:28,640
destination this is, partially because a lot of
the sections here are partially destroyed or at

2551
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:33,778
least are unfamiliar to you. You've not spent a
lot of time in this northern area of Emon.

2552
02:51:33,778 --> 02:51:40,195
Scanlan, you dart off for a second, seeing a
similar crossroads between alleys, and you find a

2553
02:51:40,195 --> 02:51:46,540
well that very much appears to be, and you know
it's yours because there's a number of copper and

2554
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:49,145
gold coins that are scattered around the base of
the well.

2555
02:51:49,145 --> 02:51:52,145
SAM: This is it. Traps?

2556
02:51:52,145 --> 02:51:55,580
LAURA: I look around. Can I perceive anything or
any people around, anything?

2557
02:51:55,580 --> 02:51:57,358
MATT: Make a perception check.

2558
02:51:57,358 --> 02:52:01,129
LAURA: Natural 20.

2559
02:52:01,129 --> 02:52:11,652
MATT: All right. You-- damn, guys. You glance
about and nobody is here. Other than the sound of

2560
02:52:11,652 --> 02:52:16,150
the rain that is still smashing down from outside,
there doesn't appear to be any individual within

2561
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:18,212
visual range right now.

2562
02:52:18,212 --> 02:52:21,074
SAM: Vex, can you scan for dragons, please?

2563
02:52:21,074 --> 02:52:24,034
LIAM: I rolled a 22 for traps.

2564
02:52:24,034 --> 02:52:29,783
MATT: Okay. No traps from what you can tell. As
you look over the edge of the well, you can see

2565
02:52:29,783 --> 02:52:37,575
where the dirt has been packed in and given a
false, or a somewhat muddy bottom to the well,

2566
02:52:37,575 --> 02:52:42,569
which once held water. And around the edges you
can see where there are a couple of discarded

2567
02:52:42,569 --> 02:52:47,136
shovels thrown to the side, and chunks of the
earth that have been shoved in there to give it

2568
02:52:47,136 --> 02:52:53,639
some sort of bottom. You also see there's maybe
about 20, 30 or so haphazard coins in the bottom.

2569
02:52:53,639 --> 02:52:55,566
Empty.

2570
02:52:55,566 --> 02:52:57,466
SAM: He got it already.

2571
02:52:57,466 --> 02:52:59,151
LAURA: Dicks! Dicks.

2572
02:52:59,151 --> 02:53:01,833
SAM: Talking about dragons?

2573
02:53:01,833 --> 02:53:05,183
LAURA: No, whoever the fuck came and took all the
fucking gold.

2574
02:53:05,183 --> 02:53:06,717
SAM: The dragons came and got it.

2575
02:53:06,717 --> 02:53:07,954
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I think.

2576
02:53:07,954 --> 02:53:12,190
LAURA: Can I take one of the shovels and move some
of the dirt to see if maybe it's deeper than it looks?

2577
02:53:12,190 --> 02:53:15,709
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and move some of the
dirt, and you find a couple more coins, a total of

2578
02:53:15,709 --> 02:53:19,417
35 gold it would be, really, that you get from
it.

2579
02:53:19,417 --> 02:53:20,567
LAURA: What a waste.

2580
02:53:20,567 --> 02:53:26,360
SAM: Can we see, can I see any signs of dragon
claws or dragon slobber or anything?

2581
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:31,310
MATT: (laughs) There are none around you, and you
gather from the sheer immensity that is the Cinder

2582
02:53:31,310 --> 02:53:35,318
King that if he were to come down here and
retrieve this gold himself, most of the adjacent

2583
02:53:35,318 --> 02:53:39,818
buildings and the well would be ruined.

2584
02:53:39,818 --> 02:53:44,619
SAM: So people put a bunch of gold there then
someone else came and took it?

2585
02:53:44,619 --> 02:53:47,313
JASON: Well, allegedly a bunch of gold. Maybe
that's all they found.

2586
02:53:47,313 --> 02:53:49,782
SAM: It's your fucking people from the Clasp,
isn't it?

2587
02:53:49,782 --> 02:53:51,590
JASON: No!

2588
02:53:51,590 --> 02:53:53,861
LAURA: Can I use tracking to see if it looks like
anybody's been here?

2589
02:53:53,861 --> 02:53:56,086
MATT: Sure. Make a wisdom survival check.

2590
02:53:56,086 --> 02:54:00,208
LAURA: 19.

2591
02:54:00,208 --> 02:54:04,599
MATT: 19. There are a number of footprints,
actually. Relatively recent, that all--

2592
02:54:04,599 --> 02:54:12,033
LAURA: Is that 17 or 11? That's 11. Okay, yeah.

2593
02:54:12,033 --> 02:54:17,364
MATT: Yeah, okay. So looking about, you see the
tracks pushing northward. There's about four fresh

2594
02:54:17,364 --> 02:54:24,622
sets of prints, fresher than the others you see
around it. The trail of coins that follow that for

2595
02:54:24,622 --> 02:54:31,023
about ten, 15 feet, you can tell that they were
taken in haste. You gather by the way it's set up

2596
02:54:31,023 --> 02:54:33,960
that perhaps somebody else had found this cache
before you did.

2597
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:39,768
LAURA: I never thought, when we came back up out
of the fucking trap door, were the people still

2598
02:54:39,768 --> 02:54:40,775
unconscious?

2599
02:54:40,775 --> 02:54:42,359
MATT: Yeah, they were still unconscious.

2600
02:54:42,359 --> 02:54:43,569
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2601
02:54:43,569 --> 02:54:45,901
SAM: Let's follow the tracks. They're fresh.

2602
02:54:45,901 --> 02:54:50,054
LIAM: Are we really going to scrabble about in the
mud for coin today?

2603
02:54:50,054 --> 02:54:52,202
SAM: Well, we've come this far.

2604
02:54:52,202 --> 02:54:56,175
LIAM: Scanlan.

2605
02:54:56,175 --> 02:54:59,689
SAM: I'm very easily swayed.

2606
02:54:59,689 --> 02:55:02,052
(laughter)

2607
02:55:02,052 --> 02:55:04,004
JASON: What a great leader.

2608
02:55:04,004 --> 02:55:06,164
LIAM: We should go back to the Keep.

2609
02:55:06,164 --> 02:55:07,311
SAM: You're right, you're right.

2610
02:55:07,311 --> 02:55:08,482
LIAM: This is a waste of our time.

2611
02:55:08,482 --> 02:55:11,018
SAM: But if Vex could somehow convince us--

2612
02:55:11,018 --> 02:55:12,695
(laughter)

2613
02:55:12,695 --> 02:55:14,113
SAM: I'd be open to it.

2614
02:55:14,113 --> 02:55:17,863
LAURA: Look, the reason I wanted to come get all
of this gold is because I thought there could be a

2615
02:55:17,863 --> 02:55:24,007
lot of Gilmore's magical items that were probably
put in here. People don't realize what they have.

2616
02:55:24,007 --> 02:55:29,628
I thought it could help us a lot.

2617
02:55:29,628 --> 02:55:34,996
LIAM: I understand, and it was not a bad idea, but
this place has been cleared out, let's--

2618
02:55:34,996 --> 02:55:39,020
LAURA: But what if it's just one or two people
that came and stole everything and we could

2619
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:40,092
totally take them.

2620
02:55:40,092 --> 02:55:42,773
SAM: And they're like 100 yards away.

2621
02:55:42,773 --> 02:55:47,186
LAURA: And they're like right up the alley. Like
right there. Can I stealth ahead a little bit and see?

2622
02:55:47,186 --> 02:55:56,271
MATT: Okay. You stealth ahead, and at this point,
you follow the tracks that go to the road, and

2623
02:55:56,271 --> 02:55:58,580
they're following the alleys as well, you can see
from the way they're--

2624
02:55:58,580 --> 02:56:01,896
LIAM: Wait wait wait. I'm sorry, one second. You
know, you're very charming, but you're a fucking

2625
02:56:01,896 --> 02:56:04,790
weirdo. And I climb up after my sister stealthily
and follow.

2626
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:06,338
MATT: Okay. All right.

2627
02:56:06,338 --> 02:56:09,334
SAM: I just shrug. I think he was talking to you.

2628
02:56:09,334 --> 02:56:17,973
(laughter)

2629
02:56:17,973 --> 02:56:19,502
MATT: Okay, and what do you two do?

2630
02:56:19,502 --> 02:56:21,108
JASON: I'm going back to my trap door.

2631
02:56:21,108 --> 02:56:23,567
MATT: Okay. So Garthok, you step away from the
group and head back to the Clasp.

2632
02:56:23,567 --> 02:56:24,972
JASON: Thank you for--

2633
02:56:24,972 --> 02:56:30,758
SAM: It's been a great day killing with you. I
hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the

2634
02:56:30,758 --> 02:56:31,683
catacombs.

2635
02:56:31,683 --> 02:56:33,717
JASON: I will let the Clasp know that you're
coming.

2636
02:56:33,717 --> 02:56:39,126
SAM: Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt
to open the door.

2637
02:56:39,126 --> 02:56:42,532
They stealthed, so I don't know where they went,
do I?

2638
02:56:42,532 --> 02:56:44,170
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2639
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:47,126
LIAM: I got a natural 20 on my stealth.

2640
02:56:47,126 --> 02:56:49,612
SAM: Got a nine on perception.

2641
02:56:49,612 --> 02:56:51,814
MATT: You have no clue.

2642
02:56:51,814 --> 02:56:56,407
SAM: Can I look at the tracks? I can't read
tracks.

2643
02:56:56,407 --> 02:56:59,837
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom survival check,
just for the hell of it.

2644
02:56:59,837 --> 02:57:03,614
SAM: Three.

2645
02:57:03,614 --> 02:57:10,843
MATT: Three? Okay. You begin following a set of
tracks that you think is pretty close to theirs.

2646
02:57:10,843 --> 02:57:16,194
Pike, you're with everyone else bringing the rest
of them back to the keep. You're with the other

2647
02:57:16,194 --> 02:57:17,382
half of the group.

2648
02:57:17,382 --> 02:57:18,404
TRAVIS: You're with me, Pike.

2649
02:57:18,404 --> 02:57:19,575
MARISHA: We're babysitting.

2650
02:57:19,575 --> 02:57:21,838
MATT: You guys are babysitting the family and
Gilmore, getting him back to the keep.

2651
02:57:21,838 --> 02:57:24,708
ASHLEY: Oh. Wait, why did I stealth check?

2652
02:57:24,708 --> 02:57:28,673
MATT: To stealth with them to get out of the city,
and we'll get to you guys in just a minute.

2653
02:57:28,673 --> 02:57:30,720
ASHLEY: Oh, I thought I was going with them.

2654
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:32,637
SAM: Do I even know how to get home from here?

2655
02:57:32,637 --> 02:57:39,444
MATT: Based on that check? You get really
discombobulated in the center of the rainy midday

2656
02:57:39,444 --> 02:57:40,418
of Emon.

2657
02:57:40,418 --> 02:57:41,950
LAURA: I said I was going to be right back,
Scanlan!

2658
02:57:41,950 --> 02:57:47,287
LIAM: A hand shoots out of the darkness and grabs
Scanlan by the nose and tugs him off.

2659
02:57:47,287 --> 02:57:53,610
MATT: Okay. All right. You guys continue on, and
following the tracks a little bit, they lead

2660
02:57:53,610 --> 02:57:58,133
westward and curve down a few more alleys, heading
towards the north entrance to the Cloudtop.

2661
02:57:58,133 --> 02:58:03,281
LAURA: Ah, shit. Fuck it. They're taking it to the
fucking dragon. Dicks.

2662
02:58:03,281 --> 02:58:04,893
MATT: Do you continue to follow or do you head back?

2663
02:58:04,893 --> 02:58:06,555
LAURA: No, we'll fucking go back.

2664
02:58:06,555 --> 02:58:07,720
MATT: Okay.

2665
02:58:07,720 --> 02:58:09,847
SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

2666
02:58:09,847 --> 02:58:10,998
LAURA: Hey.

2667
02:58:10,998 --> 02:58:12,895
LIAM: Could you say that again with your nose
pinched?

2668
02:58:12,895 --> 02:58:15,034
SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

2669
02:58:15,034 --> 02:58:16,293
(laughter)

2670
02:58:16,293 --> 02:58:19,176
LAURA: We'll get back. What happened to-- where's
Gorthok?

2671
02:58:19,176 --> 02:58:20,784
SAM: Garthok.

2672
02:58:20,784 --> 02:58:22,112
LAURA: Garthok. Where is he?

2673
02:58:22,112 --> 02:58:28,103
SAM: Garthok told me he was going back to his
Clasp entrance. Our paths will cross again. He

2674
02:58:28,103 --> 02:58:30,411
also said that you were kind of weird.

2675
02:58:30,411 --> 02:58:34,351
LAURA: Oh, well. I am. I start walking back to the
keep.

2676
02:58:34,351 --> 02:58:42,720
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way back. The rest
of you make your way further south, retracing the

2677
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:48,410
path you took here since you already know what's
there. You do reach a certain point where as you

2678
02:58:48,410 --> 02:58:53,520
push down one of the alleys, a few individuals
come out, blades at the ready and, "Hey! Drop your

2679
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:57,378
"stuff. Give us what you've go--" And then, at
which--

2680
02:58:57,378 --> 02:58:58,791
MARISHA: Boof!

2681
02:58:58,791 --> 02:59:05,030
MATT: (laughs) At which point, Keyleth socks one
in the jaw as Sherri pulls out a wand and blasts

2682
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:08,054
one of the nearby pieces of stone off the wall
with a bolt of lightning.

2683
02:59:08,054 --> 02:59:09,477
MARISHA: Not today.

2684
02:59:09,477 --> 02:59:15,520
MATT: Gilmore, who steps onto his feet and carries
his weight for a second raises his hands up, and

2685
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:23,746
as he does you can see arcane bolts whipping
around him in this almost molecule-like electron

2686
02:59:23,746 --> 02:59:28,787
pattern as he goes, "Do you gentlemen seriously
wish to start this ruckus?"

2687
02:59:28,787 --> 02:59:30,203
SAM: Yeah!

2688
02:59:30,203 --> 02:59:36,740
MATT: They all go, "No." And they slowly back away
and then dart around the corner as fast as they

2689
02:59:36,740 --> 02:59:39,015
can. You hear their feet spattering against the
mud.

2690
02:59:39,015 --> 02:59:41,145
MARISHA: Keyleth goes, yeah, you better run!

2691
02:59:41,145 --> 02:59:43,019
TRAVIS: Way to tell them, Kiki.

2692
02:59:43,019 --> 02:59:48,362
MATT: As Gilmore lowers his hands, he begins to
fall forward.

2693
02:59:48,362 --> 02:59:49,591
TALIESIN: And we grab him.

2694
02:59:49,591 --> 02:59:57,855
MATT: Grab him, catch him, and he's like,
(breathing hard). "That's, that's the last of me.

2695
02:59:57,855 --> 03:00:00,849
"That's all I've got. Take me home. Please."

2696
03:00:00,849 --> 03:00:02,686
MARISHA: We're almost home. Almost home.

2697
03:00:02,686 --> 03:00:04,240
MATT: Pinches your cheek, Grog.

2698
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:05,481
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2699
03:00:05,481 --> 03:00:07,724
(laughter)

2700
03:00:07,724 --> 03:00:17,459
MATT: You guys continue to the path. As you make
your way through the groups of the dead that you

2701
03:00:17,459 --> 03:00:21,369
passed before, a lot of them have since been taken
off the street and you can see now graves are

2702
03:00:21,369 --> 03:00:27,692
being dug right outside of the gate as you find
the south gate. Do you want to walk through the

2703
03:00:27,692 --> 03:00:32,013
fields or do you want to use the same path you
took into the secret path into the Keep?

2704
03:00:32,013 --> 03:00:34,739
TRAVIS: I think the fields would be my vote.

2705
03:00:34,739 --> 03:00:35,828
LAURA: What?

2706
03:00:35,828 --> 03:00:37,356
MATT: You're not there.

2707
03:00:37,356 --> 03:00:41,043
TALIESIN: No one's noticing us at this point.
There's too much going on.

2708
03:00:41,043 --> 03:00:44,069
TRAVIS: Oh. Out of the city is I think the safest
way.

2709
03:00:44,069 --> 03:00:51,339
MARISHA: Why wouldn't we take the secret passage?
It's here, right? No?

2710
03:00:51,339 --> 03:00:56,096
MATT: As soon as you say secret passage, Gren, the
little boy, is like, "Did you say secret passage?"

2711
03:00:56,096 --> 03:00:58,621
MARISHA: I did! I did!

2712
03:00:58,621 --> 03:01:01,530
MATT: Comes up and like, "I've never seen a secret
passage before."

2713
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:02,980
MARISHA: Do you want to go see it?

2714
03:01:02,980 --> 03:01:05,806
MATT: "Can we see the secret passage?" The kids
seem really excited and you can see Salda, for the

2715
03:01:05,806 --> 03:01:08,057
first time since you've seen her, smiles a little
bit.

2716
03:01:08,057 --> 03:01:10,191
MARISHA: We can't disappoint the children.

2717
03:01:10,191 --> 03:01:15,116
TRAVIS: (sighs) Fine. Secret passage it is.

2718
03:01:15,116 --> 03:01:18,103
LAURA: Trinket's with you guys, don't forget.

2719
03:01:18,103 --> 03:01:22,557
MATT: Trinket's been keeping guard through the mud
behind you.

2720
03:01:22,557 --> 03:01:24,044
TALIESIN: Let the kids ride Trinket.

2721
03:01:24,044 --> 03:01:32,109
MATT: As a relatively stealthy bear would try. As
you make your way through the secret passage,

2722
03:01:32,109 --> 03:01:39,455
successfully finding your way back to Greyskull
Keep, you climb up back into the kitchen and there

2723
03:01:39,455 --> 03:01:47,809
you can see Laina and Erwen who are both sweaty,
their stains are soaking through their outfits.

2724
03:01:47,809 --> 03:01:51,238
They've been working around the clock to make sure
that everyone who's currently held within the keep

2725
03:01:51,238 --> 03:01:55,373
is being cared for and fed, and their faces
immediately light up as you all start pouring out

2726
03:01:55,373 --> 03:02:00,491
of the pantry. "I'm so glad to see all of you. I
wasn't sure if you'd come back."

2727
03:02:00,491 --> 03:02:03,001
SAM: Are we there now?

2728
03:02:03,001 --> 03:02:09,098
MATT: They're getting there first, before the rest
of you. And she runs up and embraces each of you,

2729
03:02:09,098 --> 03:02:13,059
wipes her brow. "I'll have food soon."

2730
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:14,819
MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay.

2731
03:02:14,819 --> 03:02:18,335
MATT: And she goes over and sees. "And the
children, you got children with you?"

2732
03:02:18,335 --> 03:02:21,856
TALIESIN: We don't know whose they are.

2733
03:02:21,856 --> 03:02:27,769
MATT: The kids get really shy, seem quiet and hide
behind Salda. She goes, "It's all right. We'll

2734
03:02:27,769 --> 03:02:33,060
"take them-- where should we take them? Where
should we go? Lead on, I've never been here before."

2735
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:34,735
ASHLEY: You can put them in my room.

2736
03:02:34,735 --> 03:02:35,916
TRAVIS: Yeah, or mine.

2737
03:02:35,916 --> 03:02:38,662
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll put them up. I can sleep in
my workshop.

2738
03:02:38,662 --> 03:02:40,865
MARISHA: I think we've pulled a lot of our beds
down--

2739
03:02:40,865 --> 03:02:43,103
MATT: Yeah, most of the beds, most of your rooms
are--

2740
03:02:43,103 --> 03:02:49,771
MARISHA: We'll find a place for you. Just get
comfortable for right now. It's a little cramped,

2741
03:02:49,771 --> 03:02:52,416
I'm sorry. It's not Castletop.

2742
03:02:52,416 --> 03:02:57,844
MATT: "You saw where we were. We'll take anything
at this point." Gilmore comes in and looks around.

2743
03:02:57,844 --> 03:03:04,033
"You know, I'm not going to lie, I always wanted
to see the place. Perhaps a tour is in order.

2744
03:03:04,033 --> 03:03:11,710
"Tomorrow." He hangs his head. You make your way
into the rest of--

2745
03:03:11,710 --> 03:03:14,440
MARISHA: I find a bed. Where's the nearest bed?

2746
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:18,045
MATT: The nearest bed would be one of the beds
that you guys moved into Sarenrae's temple.

2747
03:03:18,045 --> 03:03:19,440
MARISHA: Is there someone on it?

2748
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:23,165
MATT: There's someone sitting on it, but as soon
as you bring someone who looks as wrecked as he is--

2749
03:03:23,165 --> 03:03:24,491
MARISHA: I say, hey, beat it.

2750
03:03:24,491 --> 03:03:26,280
MATT: Yeah. They get up and leave and you lay
Gilmore down.

2751
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:27,580
LIAM: "But my elbow really hurts!"

2752
03:03:27,580 --> 03:03:29,255
(laughter)

2753
03:03:29,255 --> 03:03:36,607
MATT: After a short time of getting them
established with Greyskull Keep, the rest of Vox

2754
03:03:36,607 --> 03:03:43,764
Machina arrives, the rain now pouring heavily
outside. Looking back, you can see some of the

2755
03:03:43,764 --> 03:03:50,096
smoke has lessened. It's helping put out some of
the fires in the remaining piles of burning wood

2756
03:03:50,096 --> 03:03:52,378
that were once buildings of Emon.

2757
03:03:52,378 --> 03:04:01,095
MARISHA: Keyleth runs up to Vax and gives him a
hug. You're okay, you're okay? You did it? You

2758
03:04:01,095 --> 03:04:02,921
talked her out of it?

2759
03:04:02,921 --> 03:04:08,724
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, Keyleth. He talked me out of
it. I walk past.

2760
03:04:08,724 --> 03:04:13,005
MARISHA: Thank you. And I walk away.

2761
03:04:13,005 --> 03:04:19,968
MATT: Okay. As you guys get everyone situated in
the Keep, your mind begins to turn to what the

2762
03:04:19,968 --> 03:04:27,228
next step is in preparing for whatever the next
step you want to be. And we'll go ahead and finish

2763
03:04:27,228 --> 03:04:32,839
tonight's game at that point. Pick this up again
next week, so we can go ahead and take a moment

2764
03:04:32,839 --> 03:04:35,977
here to prepare for Critmas. I know some of you
guys have got to run, so if you've got to run, say

2765
03:04:35,977 --> 03:04:37,312
goodbye to the folks--

2766
03:04:37,312 --> 03:04:40,350
LAURA: Oh, you guys are all so wonderful and we
love you.

2767
03:04:40,350 --> 03:04:41,894
TALIESIN: Sorry.

2768
03:04:41,894 --> 03:04:50,011
MATT: We'll stay, we'll open the gifts for them.
And get those to them, so we will be surprised for them.

2769
03:04:50,011 --> 03:04:51,128
LAURA: Yes, please.

2770
03:04:51,128 --> 03:04:55,610
MATT: And also, guys, once again I want to give a
big thank you to Jason Charles Miller.

2771
03:04:55,610 --> 03:04:58,292
(cheering)

2772
03:04:58,292 --> 03:04:59,471
LAURA: Yay, Garthok!

2773
03:04:59,471 --> 03:05:01,508
MARISHA: Yeah, Garthok! Party on, Garthok!

2774
03:05:01,508 --> 03:05:10,284
JASON: So, also, tomorrow night, on this very
channel at 7PM Pacific, 10PM Eastern, I am playing

2775
03:05:10,284 --> 03:05:15,320
an acoustic concert. Right here, same channel,
just one click away.

2776
03:05:15,320 --> 03:05:17,799
TRAVIS: In character or as Jason?

2777
03:05:17,799 --> 03:05:22,572
JASON: As Jason. Maybe I'll try to write a Garthok
song before tomorrow.

2778
03:05:22,572 --> 03:05:29,453
MATT: That's awesome. Yeah, great! Yeah, guys,
come back tomorrow, 7PM on this channel and go and

2779
03:05:29,453 --> 03:05:32,349
watch Jason's awesome acoustic concert. He's a
phenomenal musician. If you haven't seen his

2780
03:05:32,349 --> 03:05:35,658
stuff, look it up beforehand just so you can get
yourself prepped.

2781
03:05:35,658 --> 03:05:38,472
TALIESIN: You can watch a bunch of music videos,
too, and maybe see some of us.

2782
03:05:38,472 --> 03:05:43,203
JASON: I think most of the people here have had
cameos in my videos.

2783
03:05:43,203 --> 03:05:47,276
MATT: Yeah, that's true, actually. So, there's
that. And, actually, Mark Holmes, who's the

2784
03:05:47,276 --> 03:05:54,533
dungeon master for the Yogscast RPG show that just
started who are friends of ours, he makes a small

2785
03:05:54,533 --> 03:05:58,907
cameo in one of the videos as well when he was in
America briefly, so it all ties together. Yeah, he

2786
03:05:58,907 --> 03:06:03,144
was there for that shoot. He's in the background
with me in one of the shots. Yeah, just look for

2787
03:06:03,144 --> 03:06:08,228
his nerdy British self. It's great. Love you,
Mark. But yeah, Jason, thank you again for

2788
03:06:08,228 --> 03:06:13,110
playing. Check out Jason tomorrow. Check him out
in the Dungeons and Dragons-- what's the game title?

2789
03:06:13,110 --> 03:06:16,914
JASON: Oh, I'm in Neverwinter. As Drizzt
Do'urden--

2790
03:06:16,914 --> 03:06:21,107
MATT: As Drizzt Do'urden! Maybe you know the name
if you've heard of any of the Forgotten Realms.

2791
03:06:21,107 --> 03:06:26,471
He's the character that everybody between 1986 and
1995 tried to make.

2792
03:06:26,471 --> 03:06:33,081
MARISHA: You're also one of the dudes in Avatar,
when they--

2793
03:06:33,081 --> 03:06:36,291
MATT: He's been in Avatar a few times.

2794
03:06:36,291 --> 03:06:39,893
JASON: Avatar: The Last Airbender, World of
Warcraft, a guy in Super Street Fighter--

2795
03:06:39,893 --> 03:06:46,902
MATT: Yeah, check out his array of characters he's
voiced. He's awesome. Well, guys, thank you so

2796
03:06:46,902 --> 03:06:52,333
much. We'll be back here in just a few minutes.
We're going to prep for Critmas, so yeah. See you soon.

2797
03:06:52,333 --> 03:06:53,694
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

2798
03:06:53,694 --> 03:06:55,195
