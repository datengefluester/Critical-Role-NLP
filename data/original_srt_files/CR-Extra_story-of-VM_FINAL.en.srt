00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,248
MATTHEW MERCER: The grandest of adventures often stem

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:07,519
from humble beginnings.

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,000
The story of Vox Machina is one such a tale.

4
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,839
They begin as a rag-tag group of Mercenaries

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,291
in the Swamp town of Stilben, eeking out a living,

6
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,416
when a job board posting brings them to Fendril Vas,

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,781
the wealthy head of a small merchant empire.

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,306
Hired to investigate new competition in town

9
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,768
called “The Myriad”, the path eventually leads them

10
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:32,344
into a chamber housing a planar rift,

11
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:33,933
pulling the group into the plane

12
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,074
of the stillborn god Crysa-Thul.

13
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,399
It is revealed that the contract was a ruse

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,113
to feed the party to the undead, fetal deity.

15
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,674
Upon destroying the abomination,

16
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:48,664
the party returns to repay Fendril’s deceit

17
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,341
with a blade to the throat.

18
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:53,248
VEX'AHLIA: Weeks pass, and Grog the barbarian hasn’t been seen

19
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:57,296
since suddenly leaving for the city of Westruun.

20
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:59,555
Heading there in search of him, the party meets

21
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,383
his childhood friend, and their new companion-

22
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,800
the gnome cleric, Pike.

23
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,920
Grog apparently hasn’t been acting normally,

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,634
and had marched off on his own through the Bramblewood,

25
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,429
towards the ominous mountain, Gatshadow.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,394
The party followed,

27
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:17,883
dispensing with a troupe of roadside thieves along the way,

28
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,073
and wound their way toward the mountain.

29
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:23,920
Deep within, they encounter an abandoned subterranean city,

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,725
and eventually a crypt housing a mind-controlled Grog,

31
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:30,798
the reanimated corpse of his father Strongjaw,

32
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:34,273
and a dying mage attempting a ritual to Lichdom.

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,694
Our heroes slayed the mage,

34
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:39,444
but not before he could complete the ritual

35
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:42,898
and embed his phylactery into Grog’s chest.

36
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,878
Returning to town in search of aid,

37
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:47,538
they find there are few of enough knowledge or power

38
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:50,095
to ascertain the nature of Grog’s wound.

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,700
Also, rumors of missing children begin to reach the party’s ears.

40
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:57,885
While contemplating all this at a local inn,

41
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,489
the party is approached by a mysterious elf

42
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,862
named Drez Vina who wishes to pay handsomely

43
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:06,013
for the party to infiltrate an Archmage’s Tower,

44
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,762
and retrieve a particular Brass Box within.

45
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,142
Pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this Archmage,

46
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:16,889
the party accepts, and passes through arcane trap after trap

47
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:19,280
to reach the top of the tower,

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,515
deciding not to steal from the Archmage but instead

49
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:24,815
parlay with him for his aid.

50
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:28,318
The tower’s keeper, Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien,

51
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,724
agrees to help and sends the party to collect two items

52
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:33,952
he requires for the ritual:

53
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:37,821
the Skull of a Nightmare, and the Heart of a Nymph.

54
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:41,594
The caveat: their defeated foe is indeed a Lich now,

55
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:46,937
and in merely two weeks, he will be reborn within Grog!

56
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,119
They travel north to the Umbra Hills,

57
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,340
wrestle with a small cult to slay their infernal messenger

58
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,167
and his Nightmare steed, and find a fresh companion in Percy,

59
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,771
newly freed from imprisonment.

60
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:02,873
From there, the party rushes south to the Frostweald,

61
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:06,311
a forest shrouded in eternal winter.

62
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,758
Battling past Basilisks, the party finds a single,

63
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:15,171
unfrozen pool where they coax a Nymph from her dimensional sanctuary.

64
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:19,264
Talking their way out of battle, Grog enters the sanctuary with the Nymph,

65
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:24,187
and returns holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature:

66
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,663
the “heart” of the Nymph.

67
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:30,493
VAX'ILDAN: Traveling back to the Archmage, the ritual is completed

68
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:33,152
and the phylactery destroyed in time,

69
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:37,221
but not without some lingering necromancy branded within Grog.

70
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,472
They are suddenly approached by the mysterious elf again,

71
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,565
saying his master is unhappy with the broken contract,

72
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,318
and demands that either the debt be paid,

73
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,576
or the party complete a more difficult contract in its place.

74
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:56,009
The party accepts, and heads into the Shade Barrow,

75
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,544
an ancient Druid burial chamber that was purchased

76
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:02,758
and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his own tomb.

77
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,654
Fighting the denizens of the barrow,

78
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:08,872
they locate the tomb... and the Iron Golem guarding it.

79
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:12,411
Successfully defeating the Golem, they tear the Arcane Cortex

80
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:17,012
from its chest and return it to Drez, to square their debt.

81
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:21,686
After a bit of R&amp;R, a clean-shaven dwarf named Grimthorne

82
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:26,035
propositions the group to enter a nearby, underground fighting ring,

83
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,898
even offering to represent them.

84
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:34,626
The party agrees and manages to pull off a victory!

85
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:37,360
With the holiday of Winter’s Crest arriving,

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,275
the town bustles with preparation for a festival,

87
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:44,589
during which a strange, blue crystal is delivered

88
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,152
in the name of Archmage Eskil.

89
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,245
This crystal suddenly detonates,

90
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:52,203
freezing the entire populace of Westruun in ice-

91
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:56,668
though the party is protected by a sudden ally in the streets.

92
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:00,867
In a last ditch, arcane effort, a mystic merchant named Noja

93
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,938
manages to shield the group from harm.

94
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:08,860
And where the crystal previously rested now stands a pale,

95
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,172
nude woman of white hair and frail physique.

96
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,295
She opens a portal and leaps through, the party giving chase

97
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,757
into what seems like an icy, frozen world,

98
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:22,455
chaotic and elemental in nature.

99
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,187
They catch up to the woman, who then reveals her true self:

100
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:28,389
a great white dragon.

101
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:34,439
Weakened by her premature “rebirth”, the party manages to defeat her,

102
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,378
and upon returning to Westruun,

103
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,910
discover its people released from their icy prison.

104
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,975
With the Archmage Eskil Ryndarien now on trial

105
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,553
for the attack on Westruun, the party intercedes

106
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,528
and proves his innocence.

107
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:52,286
In thanks, Eskil uses his talents to investigate the source

108
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:56,984
of the Blue Crystal, revealing the powerful society of thieves

109
00:05:56,984 --> 00:06:00,643
known as The Clasp responsible for its delivery.

110
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:04,718
Vax, having previously been a member of the Clasp,

111
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:09,265
knows the main headquarters lies within the capital city of Emon,

112
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:12,270
and Vox Machina sets out for the west.

113
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,742
PIKE: Upon arriving in the sprawling metropolis of Emon,

114
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,574
the party continues to hear of children disappearing,

115
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,597
and reports of a Black-haired, golden-eyed boy

116
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,321
befriending them before they vanish.

117
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:28,247
While investigating, they do a few odd jobs, one of which

118
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:33,591
unexpectedly leads them to the home of Syldor, Vex and Vax’s father,

119
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:36,676
and his new wife and child.

120
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:41,023
Awkwardness aside, Syldor is here as ambassador to Syngorn,

121
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,752
the elven city of their origin, to seek aid

122
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,782
from the Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei.

123
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,352
However, the political climate of Emon is tense

124
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:52,965
with a recent, failed attempt on the Royal Family’s life

125
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:56,853
making Uriel unreachable at the moment.

126
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,101
Syldor’s connection within the Council has now gone missing,

127
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,863
and his mission stands at a complete standstill.

128
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:06,483
He hires the party to look in on this missing ally,

129
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:11,571
Sir Gregory Fince, and get his ear back toward Syngornian business.

130
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:15,618
Vox Machina find’s Sir Gregory’s home dark and still,

131
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:18,948
pushing them to infiltrate and investigate.

132
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:22,134
Within, they discover a dark presence in the home,

133
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:25,520
leading them into a battle with demons in the basement.

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,012
The battle won, Sir Gregory’s tortured corpse is found,

135
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:35,286
as are his notes about the attempted “assassination” on Uriel and his family.

136
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:37,737
It seems that since the attempt,

137
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,526
the Royal Family has grown strange and withdrawn,

138
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,607
keeping Uriel from the council most hours,

139
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,626
and his wife now demanding she attend all meetings,

140
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:51,918
whispering in the Sovereign’s ear and scoffing at the others who defy their decree.

141
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,206
A General Krieg thwarted the attempt, and is mentioned often.

142
00:07:57,206 --> 00:08:00,801
The party decides to inquire with him.

143
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:04,722
On their way out of the basement, half of the party falls into a trap,

144
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:07,386
tumbling into a cistern and are flushed deep below

145
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,119
into a subterranean river system.

146
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:15,378
The trapped party members-Vex, Keyleth, Grog, Tiberius, and Percy-

147
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:20,341
come to rest on a small island in the vast Crystalfen Lake,

148
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,951
home to a terrible aboleth!

149
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:26,009
Barely escaping, they eventually discover the base remnants

150
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,831
of an ancient town, long toppled, and a small hut

151
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:33,514
that contains a clever hag named Trysta.

152
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,117
Tiberius finds one of his prized artifacts,

153
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,256
and makes a dangerous deal to acquire it.

154
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:43,936
The party barters for information on how to escape,

155
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:47,343
which Trysta will give... in exchange for their aid

156
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:52,397
in slaying a newly nested denizen that threatens her... work.

157
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:56,521
The party agrees, climbing to the very top of the Crystalfen Cavern

158
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,329
to do battle with an Umberhulk!

159
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,516
The fight goes south when Grog is tossed from the cavern ceiling,

160
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:05,805
nearly dying upon impact with the island,

161
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,215
but victory is eventually theirs.

162
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,199
Returning, Trysta shows them a hidden staircase

163
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,332
that exits into the Graveyard District of Emon.

164
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,375
GROG: The other members-Vax, Pike, and Scanlan-

165
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,975
set out to find where the cistern could have drained to.

166
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:27,240
Scanlan leaves to seek out a map of the sewers,

167
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,602
while Vax and Pike notice they are being followed through the town.

168
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:33,768
Leading the pursuers into an alley,

169
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,129
the shadowed figures attack,

170
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,472
eventually knocking them both out.

171
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,318
Vax and Pike awaken within The Clasp’s headquarters,

172
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:46,448
meeting with one of their leaders, or Spirelings, named Modeth.

173
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:51,115
The Clasp had Sir Gregory’s home under surveillance,

174
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,858
as bad political stuff

175
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,896
can be difficult for the way the Clasp does business,

176
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:59,227
and when our heroes were spotted leaving,

177
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,004
they had to be interrogated.

178
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:05,743
Vax reveals his membership to the Clasp sect in Westruun,

179
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:11,034
and Modeth calls for a test of their skills and intent.

180
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:14,127
Pike and Vax are then forced to do battle

181
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:17,693
with a chained chimera in the Clasp’s Arena.

182
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:22,616
Their might rings true, and the beast falls beneath their weapons,

183
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:25,514
but Modeth is not convinced.

184
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,728
While the two are held overnight,

185
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,616
they manage to escape from the Clasp’s lair,

186
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,333
exiting into the night,

187
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:37,119
and managing to locate the rest of the party in the Graveyard district.

188
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,769
Knowing their next step is to speak with General Krieg,

189
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,215
Vax forges a letter of summons using Sir Gregory’s handwriting,

190
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:50,591
and the party is allowed entry into the carefully guarded Cloudtop District,

191
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:55,222
the innermost area of the city and home to the Citrine Garrison,

192
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,631
as well as Emon’s Palace.

193
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:01,755
Approaching the Garrison, they have an audience with General Krieg,

194
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,122
who seems nice and keenly interested

195
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,646
upon learning of the Clasp’s involvement.

196
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:11,793
He also mentions the difficulty in talking with Uriel since the attack,

197
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,946
and is sad about the death of Sir Gregory,

198
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:19,577
but warns to leave the investigation to the officials.

199
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:22,102
Vox Machina then heads to the Palace

200
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:25,090
to try their hand at speaking with Uriel,

201
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,545
but entry is barred.

202
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:31,197
They find another is being prevented from entering,

203
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:34,457
a golden-haired woman in fancy blue robes

204
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:37,653
who angrily stomps away from the palace doors.

205
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:41,580
They engage her in conversation, and she reveals herself

206
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,335
to be Allura Vysoren, a powerful arcanist

207
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:50,075
and member of the Tal’Dorei Council.

208
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:53,307
They discuss the state of things within the palace,

209
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:57,678
how Uriel is a good and trusted man, but his actions

210
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:02,442
(and those of the Empress Salda) are recently suspect.

211
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:05,891
After seven days of being kept from the council chambers,

212
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,586
she’s about to give up and leave.

213
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:12,838
The party tells her of their findings, and Allura leads them to her tower

214
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:17,818
within the district to further discuss the matter in private.

215
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,257
SCANLAN: Within, Allura and the party make an alliance,

216
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:25,150
and Keyleth aids her in performing a scrying ritual on the palace.

217
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:28,896
The vision reveals that the family of Uriel, his wife,

218
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:34,252
2 daughters, and son, are all under the influence of some demonic force,

219
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,633
and have addled the mind of their father,

220
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,807
using him as a mouthpiece for their plot.

221
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,916
The party decides to pay a visit to The Clasp,

222
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,726
using Vax and Pike’s knowledge of an entrance,

223
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:50,019
and end up in a confrontation with Spireling Modeth within his chambers.

224
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,228
The battle ends with Modeth’s head on the floor,

225
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:56,470
and four strange, glowing crystals he had been keeping

226
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,183
now stolen by the party.

227
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,612
They attempt to leave,

228
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,237
but are met by a host of Clasp members,

229
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:05,834
and another, dangerous-looking Spireling.

230
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:09,584
Through Scanlan’s deft lies and coercion,

231
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:13,863
the party is allowed to leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered.

232
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:17,313
They return to Allura’s tower only to find the front door ajar

233
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:20,684
and the interior tossed by some previous scuffle.

234
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,388
As they reach the top of the tower, they investigate,

235
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,945
finding signs of a struggle with a demonic entity,

236
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:31,032
and Allura’s escape seemingly successful.

237
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:34,475
Unfortunately, a magical defense of the tower is triggered,

238
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:37,433
and it begins to cave and crumble around them.

239
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,311
Through a little ingenuity-and the discovery of a magic carpet-

240
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,748
the party manages to escape being crushed within,

241
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:51,163
Allura’s ivory monolith now compacted into a single, magical pearl.

242
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,798
Our heroes then locate and enter the home of General Krieg,

243
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:57,715
finding a brainwashed servant, and a hidden passage

244
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,648
that leads to a teleportation circle.

245
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:04,583
Using the device, they are transported to a distant cavern,

246
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,685
high in a range of frost-covered mountains,

247
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:12,703
and an incredible hoard of gold, jewels, and fine trinkets.

248
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:17,677
Across the room are 4 obsidian orbs placed within the rock.

249
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:22,285
As one is touched, a giant eye appears from within the black crystal

250
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:26,150
and a voice erupts, calling for a “Brimscythe”,

251
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,411
and noticing the unfamiliar folk, mentions,

252
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,363
“Intruders... I know your face now.

253
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:36,637
He is a fool, and so are you, insect.”

254
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:41,856
The orbs all crack simultaneously, becoming inert.

255
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:45,581
Grog’s dives right in, rage-looting the gold,

256
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:48,270
but the arrival of the party seems to call the attention

257
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,993
of General Krieg, who appears at the Teleportation Circle.

258
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:56,727
He angrily denounces the party and reveals his true form,

259
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,887
that of a frightening blue dragon!

260
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:04,567
KEYLETH: The battle is difficult, with many an ally nearly devoured,

261
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,223
but eventually Vax strikes a mortal blow.

262
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:12,796
Krieg, or “Brimscythe,” defiantly smashes against the support pillars of the cavern

263
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:16,192
in his death throes, causing the chamber to collapse,

264
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:19,977
the party barely escaping via the Teleportation Circle.

265
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,996
Leaving Krieg’s home, Allura finds the party

266
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:26,917
and warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is growing more bold.

267
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:30,213
She herself was attacked shortly after the Scrying was complete,

268
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:32,375
and barely escaped.

269
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,758
As dark clouds fill the sky above Emon,

270
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:37,266
the party decides the time to strike has come.

271
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,692
Allura aids the party in infiltrating the palace,

272
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,855
and they storm the throne room.

273
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:46,669
Uriel sits upon his throne, surrounded by his creepily mannered,

274
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,891
possessed family. Vox Machina attacks,

275
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:53,299
managing to banish the shadows from within their bodies,

276
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,270
but the throne itself cracks in half

277
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,056
as the dais below glows a deep red,

278
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,280
summoning the entity behind the entire scheme:

279
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,377
a Devil prince called Juurezel, who tells the party

280
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,604
of a great war between Devils and Demons spilling over into this plane,

281
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,637
threatening all creation.

282
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,981
He justifies his actions,

283
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:15,828
and notes all the demonic forces throughout the city,

284
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:18,540
and tells them of the horrible devastation that will ensue

285
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,604
if the party stops him.

286
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,022
They read him as honest, and Juurezel asks for their aid

287
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:26,306
in destroying the demonic threat,

288
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:29,885
offering a single Wish should they make a pact.

289
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:33,432
The party deliberates and agrees to the contract.

290
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:35,500
Thinking over what they had just agreed to,

291
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,546
the party returns to the throne room,

292
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,795
asking for their wish to be provided,

293
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:42,200
to aid them in their demon hunting.

294
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,514
Upon its casting, the party wishes to cancel their contract

295
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,941
with the creature, and attack!

296
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,146
The devil prince angrily reveals his true form,

297
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:55,226
a hideous treachery demon, a Glabrezu.

298
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:59,487
A long, deadly, and epic confrontation ensues,

299
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:03,557
one that suddenly claims the life of the Gnomish Cleric, Pike.

300
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:07,823
Her death fresh in their minds, Vox Machina deals the killing blow,

301
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,905
sending the Demon to its unmaking.

302
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,114
They gather up the cold body of their fallen friend

303
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:17,219
and rush her to a nearby Temple of Sarenrae,

304
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,380
where a resurrection ritual is attempted...

305
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,865
and succeeds.

306
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:27,432
PERCY: The clouds disperse, the immediate danger over,

307
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:31,079
but the royal family lies on the throne room floor, catatonic.

308
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:36,946
Upon inspection, their souls are missing, and the bodies failing.

309
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:39,188
The party recalls the four glowing orbs

310
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,759
they recovered from the Clasp Headquarters behind Modeth,

311
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,727
now identified as Soul Jars,

312
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,441
and through a rigorous and tense evening,

313
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,139
all souls are successfully restored to the family.

314
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,314
A few days pass, and Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei

315
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,694
calls the party for audience.

316
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,157
He thanks them all for their bravery, heroism,

317
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:05,217
and for saving him, his family, and quite possibly all of Emon.

318
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,685
As thanks, he offers them a place on the Tal’Dorei Council

319
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:12,932
and informs them of his intent to throw another Winter’s Crest festival

320
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,357
to make up for the ones ruined in Westruun,

321
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:17,504
and here via assassination attempt,

322
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,654
where they will be celebrated as heroes!

323
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:23,015
He has also commissioned the construction of a Keep for them,

324
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:28,279
on the outskirts of Emon, as a sign of his very deep gratitude.

325
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,242
A week later, the festival begins!

326
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:35,396
The populace is out in full force to meet and celebrate Vox Machina,

327
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:37,757
but during the festivities,

328
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:43,051
the party notices Uriel’s son Gren speaking to another child-

329
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:47,022
one with black hair, and golden eyes.

330
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,926
They immediately spring to apprehend the child,

331
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,709
but he escapes with Uriel’s son.

332
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,773
They give chase, following him into an alley,

333
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,266
and through a portal of some kind.

334
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:01,500
The party finds themselves atop a large island

335
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,913
drifting through the Astral Plane,

336
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:06,468
surrounded by a perilous bramble forest.

337
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:10,670
They fight their way through, eventually coming upon a gothic mansion

338
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,116
towards the center of the landmass.

339
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:16,602
Within, the party makes their way to the inner library,

340
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,351
where numerous kidnapped children

341
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:21,448
are working all about the place, cleaning nervously.

342
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:26,855
The Dread Emperor, as he calls himself, stands from his chair,

343
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:30,148
the child illusion fading into a golden-armored man

344
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:34,469
of long, black hair, four children chained at the neck to his breastplate.

345
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,884
He attacks the party with fierce magic,

346
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:41,366
mind-controlling all of his child servants to attack as well.

347
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:44,344
With the first blow dealt, they realize

348
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:47,464
that damaging him also hurts the chained children,

349
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:51,422
one boy accidentally falling in battle to Keyleth’s magic.

350
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:55,293
Eventually, they succeed in destroying the Dread Emperor

351
00:19:55,293 --> 00:20:00,326
and return to Emon with a host of lost children, happily now found.

352
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:04,536
Six months of peace follow as their new keep is constructed,

353
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,515
and the party scatters to their separate business until its completion.

354
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:12,336
Upon their return, they assess their new abode with delight,

355
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,781
naming it Greyskull Keep.

356
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,511
They then send out job inquiries, seeking guards for hire, and servants.

357
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,399
After an impromptu “try-out,” they settle upon their new hires.

358
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:27,559
MATTHEW MERCER: That evening, the party receives a visitor

359
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,165
in their friend Arcanist Allura Vysoren.

360
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,987
She happily sits with the party for dinner,

361
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,627
and trades tales of their past months,

362
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,140
before asking if she could hire their services

363
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,576
for a matter of great personal importance.

364
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:44,340
Allura’s long time friend and ally,

365
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,886
Lady Kima of Vord, has gone missing,

366
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,915
following a vision quest from her deity,

367
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,246
the platinum dragon Bahamut.

368
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:54,103
Her last letter spoke of an evil taking root

369
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:59,419
beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer, and Allura worries for her safety.

370
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,097
While Allura is unable to go herself,

371
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:05,129
she can provide the proper paperwork for entry,

372
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:10,327
and would pay handsomely if they could find, aid, and return with Kima.

373
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,378
Vox Machina agrees to the new contract,

374
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:17,695
and sets out for the city of Kraghammer the very next day.

375
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,633
As for the rest of their journey...

376
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,418
the legend of Vox Machina is still being written.
