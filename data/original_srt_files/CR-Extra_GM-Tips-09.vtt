NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
MATT: Hi. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a voice
actor and the Dungeon Master for Critical Role

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.047
here on Geek &amp; Sundry, and today's episode of GM
Tips involves seeing what's behind the GM screen

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:13.609
and some tips and tricks on how to prepare
yourself and your station for being a game master.

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:19.055
[intro music plays]

00:00:19.055 --> 00:00:25.159
MATT: As a game master, your realm is a blend
of preparation and unexpected chaos and adapting

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.021
somewhere between the two of those and, as such,
your area directly behind your GM screen is your

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:35.221
saving grace. It's a wonderful plane of notes,
information, and various tools to help you in

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:41.833
crafting your story, which will inevitably be
flying directly out of your ass. Let's take a

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.483
look at some of my prepared GM area, then I'll
give some recommendations and the kind of things

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:48.640
you might want to consider having available behind
yours. Come on, let's have a look.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.249
Welcome to my domain. Here is my basic set up,
beginning with this. This is the official dungeon

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.179 line:1
master screen for Fifth Edition D&amp;D. Like a
lot of systems, especially the more popular ones,

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.720 line:1
make this available with pre-set rules and tables
and breakdowns to remind you as a GM and have

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.309
quick access to these various aspects as they come
into your game. Now, even with these official

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:16.379
rules that are given to you, maybe not all of them
are useful to your specific campaign or there

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:19.710
might be aspects of the rule system that come up
more often than others that you want to make sure

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.591 line:1
are front and center, so you can actually print
these out and tape them individually to the screen

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:28.049
over things that are maybe aren't as useful. Like
here I have lists about improvising damage, trap

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.935
save DCs, and attack bonuses against PCs. I have
damage severity by level, potion of healing

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:38.331
breakdowns so I know what different levels of
healing potions heal what amount. Reminders of

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:42.160
things I forget often, like concentration checks,
highlighted in bright yellow to remind me to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.801
actually remember that (bleep). Actually,
right over here on the far side you can see I have

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:52.069
a collection of my players' passive perception.
Very useful. That's the GM screen right there.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.718
You also need some dice. That might come in handy.
Some systems don't need it, but for the most part

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:02.867
you need some dice. That's helpful. Of course,
your preparation notes. Over here I have my

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:07.441
campaign notes, which contains a basic player
sheet, a cheat sheet of all the rules and things

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.271
that I can come to for quick reference so I don't
have to have the books nearby, which by the way,

00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:16.460 line:1
it helps to have the books nearby, just in case. I
have the breakdown in my binder, my little setup

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.630
here of the current session as well as maybe a few
previous sessions in case I have to reference them

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.740
in the past. I have sheets for custom NPCs and
various monsters they may encounter or have

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.320
encountered. I have breakdowns of
various locations in my world with notes on NPCs

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.761
and factions and different things that I can refer
to if it comes up during the campaign. That way

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:43.020
I'm not going through my old computer or having to
leave the table to go find it. Just keeping basic

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.460
notes at your disposal in your binder is extremely
helpful. I have lists of names for NPCs in case

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.330
you have to create something on the spot you can
go ahead and refer to this page. Say one of the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.111
names on the list and then just cross it off and
make a note of where they actually encountered

00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:02.128
that NPC for later. This binder becomes a
very helpful tool to make sure that you're on top

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:03.589
of your game during your actual session.

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.040 line:1
Next to that you want a notepad. Empty sheets for
scratch notes. You're going to be taking notes the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.302
whole time, whether it be just marking which
players had cool moments that you want to award

00:03:12.302 --> 00:03:17.200
bonus experience or items to down the road, or
those NPCs you just made up. You can go ahead and

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.830
write down that basic information that way you can
go back to it later without forgetting that even

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.579
happened in the campaign. Scratch pad, really
useful. Also, over to the side here I have

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.911 line:1
miniatures for monsters they may encounter. That
way they're readily at my disposal if I go ahead

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:38.098
and throw down a battle map. I have
a nice little timer here. You can do a digital

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:42.530 line:1
timer as well. I prefer things a little more
presenter-y like this, but this helps you throw

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.252 line:1
down a little bit of tension in a time-based
encounter and the players will freak out as soon

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:50.552
as this or a digital timer hits the table and lets
them know you only have five minutes to complete

00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:52.740
this challenge. It's a pretty fun little tool.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.129
Over here I have wet-erase markers. These are very
useful for one, writing notes on your GM screen or

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.780 line:1
any plastic sheets you have on your screen. These
are also great for battle maps, if all of a sudden

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.950 line:1
something you prepared goes haywire or the player
pushes in a direction you weren't expecting, you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.180
can go ahead and sketch down some elements of that
map with some of these wet erase markers.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.020
Very helpful. I have various markers for statuses
and conditions in the game, where a creature or

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.529
monster gets poisoned or stunned, I can go ahead
and throw that on to there as well. They have

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:28.850 line:1
official ones you can purchase for certain gaming sets. 
These are actually just soda tabs that I found multi-colored.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.270
That way it's cheaper. Also, if you have a party member
who happens to transform a lot, like a druid or

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.549
someone with polymorph, it helps to have a
collection of various miniatures that show what

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:45.591
creature they may be able to transform into, once
again preventing you from having to run off to

00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:49.689
wherever your collection is in the other room. You
can have these at the ready to pull out at a

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.399
moment's notice. Very helpful.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:58.870 line:1
I have my iPad or whatever you want to use for
music. Soundtrack is a very good way to keep

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.642 line:1
everyone in your immersive atmosphere. Build up
some of your favorite movie fantasy soundtracks or

00:05:04.642 --> 00:05:09.010
even just video game soundtracks that you have at
your disposal. If you're doing this on Twitch or

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.659
anywhere public or live, make sure that you have
permission to use it first, but at your home game

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.522
you can play whatever the heck you want. Having
that right behind the screen and readily available

00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:22.461
to press or change is a huge boon to
building the atmosphere of the game. I also

00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:27.289
have some templates to help me guide the size and
area of certain spells and effects in the game. I

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.360 line:1
made these, but you can find templates like this
online that you can just download and print out

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.804 line:1
and laminate, and it costs you practically nothing
and you have equally awesome and functional

00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:37.679
templates at your disposal.

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:44.180
There are many, many other cool options you
can prepare and have at the ready and many online

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.601
GMing forums like EN World and official RPG
websites that provide an endless source of these

00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:53.401
types of recommendations. You can pick and choose
and customize your own GM setup however befits

00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:58.029
your own form of storytelling. I just hope this
little glance helped give you any ideas on how to

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.150
better prepare your own GM set up. Thank you
so much for watching. My name is Matthew Mercer.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.350
