00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:06,030
MATT: Hello everyone, welcome to the fifth episode
of Critical Role! Before we start and get into the

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,451
videos for our initial intro, let me go over a
couple of things for the evening. First off, we're

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:14,627
shooting to get to 1,500 subscribers by this
evening, and as soon as we get there, we're giving

4
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:20,211
out a promo kit that's worth about $250, which is
awesome. We'll all go ahead and sign it at the end

5
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:24,888
of the day and get it out to you as well. Also,
Tabletop Day is coming up this Saturday, and a few

6
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:28,258
of us will be showing up during the stream as well
and any of you guys playing your own tabletop

7
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,070
games at home, or whatever the case may be, if you
go to the website and register, for each person

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,898
that registers, we're giving away a boardgame to
the charity Big Brothers and Big Sisters, so

9
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:39,337
that's a really, really cool thing that you guys
should get involved with. That's this Saturday, at

10
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:46,807
International Tabletop Day, and also, we received
a present apparently from the audience.

11
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:47,702
TRAVIS: A present?

12
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:48,718
MATT: That I get to open.

13
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:49,932
LIAM: Vat eez zis present?

14
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:50,670
[static]

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,613
MATT: I don't know vat zis present eez, but now I
get to open zis.

16
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:53,279
ALL: Ooh!

17
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,230
MATT: This is for all of us, apparently.

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,024
TALIESIN: What kind of sack is that?

19
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:04,247
MATT: It is a big-- oh, it is a gigantic sack.

20
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:05,209
ORION: Ooh, I love gigantic sacks

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,898
MATT: Oh my god guys, this is, this is amazing!

22
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,873
LAURA: There's a card on it.

23
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:08,722
MATT: All right.

24
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:09,652
LAURA: On the other side.

25
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:16,782
MATT: There's a card? Oh snap. By the power of
#TeamNoStream, you have the power.

26
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:19,363
By Negihama, thank you Negihama.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,026
ALL: Thank you Negihama!

28
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:28,263
MATT: That's amazing, as we now have for the
group, a castle Greyskull.

29
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:33,376
ALL: Huzzah! Yay!

30
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:37,119
MATT: So during the intro break we're going to go
ahead and open this and find a place for it

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,872
nearby, 'cause this is now representative of the
keep that the players have waiting for them at

32
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:46,439
Emon once they get out of this horrible mess.
Anyway guys, welcome to Critical Role,

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,360
let's get into those intros, shall we?

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,886
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

35
00:01:55,886 --> 00:02:01,839
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

36
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:07,902
left them with the curse of the last name of
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

37
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:12,952
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

38
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:19,736
family at a young age after a dream-- a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

39
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:24,840
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,086
life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike
seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was

41
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:38,668
animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had
a purpose in making things whole that had once

42
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:44,646
been broken. She studied and learned the ways to
heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful

43
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:51,274
life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was
captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

44
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:56,945
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he

45
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:03,961
himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,
abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for

46
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:11,138
help. She prayed, and healed this barbarian as
best she could, bringing him back to life. When he

47
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:18,874
awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw.
After that, they were the best of friends, a

48
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:25,110
rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in
a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

49
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:34,202
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt

50
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:39,972
angry. She wanted to be stronger, so that it would
never happen again. She spent four months at sea,

51
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:46,138
training with the men and women aboard a ship
called The Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol

52
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:54,254
in one hand, and her morningstar in the other,
this time, Pike is ready.

53
00:03:54,254 --> 00:04:02,300
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

54
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:10,195
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

55
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:20,870
combat, women, and ale. Wait. Easily the brains of
the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast

56
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:29,684
knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale. In his early years, armed with his

57
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:35,647
two-handed greataxe, Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks of his family's

58
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:41,898
wandering herd. But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he

59
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:49,594
objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for

60
00:04:49,594 --> 00:05:00,261
this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost
him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd

61
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:08,156
leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and
left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then

62
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:16,088
that the relative of the very gnome he fought to
save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome

63
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:23,119
cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him
back from death's edge. And they have remained

64
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:30,150
close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be
found challenging entire taverns to wrestling

65
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:41,810
matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest
house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.

66
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,747
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

67
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:50,819
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

68
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:59,220
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to
underestimate her based on first impressions.

69
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,318
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

70
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:11,430
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants. Literally. Born to the

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,983
Air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised
with a deep love of nature and the elemental

72
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:23,298
magics. It is her people's inherent duty to
protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the

73
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:28,892
four elemental planes begin to bleed with this
realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite

74
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:35,008
a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping
abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and

75
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:42,036
flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which I do.
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of

76
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:48,336
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to

77
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:54,437
succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like
that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

78
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:59,512
replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

79
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:05,466
high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

80
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:11,550
in order to introduce and establish respect
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the

81
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,714
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

82
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:24,387
discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

83
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:31,008
towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

84
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:37,804
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

85
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:45,960
thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even
worthy?

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,171
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

87
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:55,230
the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

88
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:02,405
lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the
sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a

89
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:08,237
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

90
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:13,537
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

91
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:20,292
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

92
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:26,610
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

93
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,533
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

94
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:38,533
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

95
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:45,304
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a

96
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:52,280
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

97
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,739
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun. (gunshot)

98
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:04,689
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

99
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:10,867
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

100
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:18,170
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

101
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,148
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day, he

102
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:30,624
was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined
Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where

103
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:36,857
he learned the ways of the world and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

104
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:41,408
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

105
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:47,239
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

106
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:53,603
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

107
00:09:53,603 --> 00:10:01,439
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

108
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:07,730
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood

109
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:14,420
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

110
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,766
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

111
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:28,319
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

112
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:34,225
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

113
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:39,532
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

114
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:44,237
the Draconian High Council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

115
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:48,763
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian

116
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:55,107
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

117
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:01,441
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

118
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:06,669
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

119
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:11,883
months I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

120
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:16,406
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the High

121
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:21,049
Council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

122
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:26,908
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

123
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:32,762
to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

124
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:37,888
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms,

125
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:42,894
going from town to town and making friends and
allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

126
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:48,973
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed

127
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:55,039
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

128
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,658
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

129
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:06,294
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

130
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:13,926
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

131
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:20,296
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

132
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:25,175
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

133
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:31,663
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

134
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:38,828
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

135
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:43,218
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

136
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:49,226
elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

137
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:54,850
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

138
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,097
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

139
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:06,683
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

140
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:13,608
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

141
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:22,656
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

142
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:29,612
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

143
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:36,196
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

144
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:44,383
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

145
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:49,513
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

146
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:54,201
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

147
00:13:54,201 --> 00:14:01,653
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

148
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:06,765
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

149
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:15,017
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

150
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:20,189
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

151
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:26,450
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

152
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:33,264
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

153
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:41,325
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

154
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:49,150
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

155
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:56,339
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. And through a series of

156
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:04,112
fateful events, earned herself a companion in the
form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight

157
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:13,565
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable and gives expert massages.

158
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:18,586
MATT: Welcome back, guys. So we finally have
Pike's video finished, so I hope you got to enjoy

159
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:25,720
that. As a heads-up, too, unfortunately we're
going to be down one Scanlan due to work, but

160
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,521
that's okay, the bard will be in our hearts this
evening, and you're welcome to tweet at him

161
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:31,620
angrily to make sure he makes the next session.

162
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,783
LAURA: Yeah.

163
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:39,400
MATT: So, without further ado, let's go and kick
into the recap. So, the party has initially been

164
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,347
sent down on a mission by the arcanist Allura
Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has

165
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:51,530
gone missing, named Lady Kima of Vord. A folk hero
and a very respected individual, she went on a

166
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,708
vision quest and apparently went alone into
Kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that

167
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:02,157
was festering beneath the city, and hasn't been
seen for weeks and weeks. The party was hired by

168
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:06,727
her to go and try to find her whereabouts and
hopefully bring her back safely. Since traversing

169
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:13,601
and meeting individuals in Kraghammer, they then
spearheaded into the Greyspine Mines where

170
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:18,595
apparently these monstrosities have been burbling
out time and time again over the past few weeks.

171
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:22,466
Pushing down, they had encountered umber hulks,
they managed to inquire some duergar, which,

172
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:28,263
apparently there's a lot of them down here.
Duergar being an ashy-skinned, subterranean dark,

173
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:36,971
evil dwarf-type offshoot. One of which had with it
a brain-type quadruped that managed to Brain Spike

174
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:42,262
Grog and send him catatonic for a short time.
They, wandering through the caverns, discovered

175
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:48,178
there was a duergar war camp across the way from--
across this large chasm that was currently being

176
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:52,159
run by a general duergar alongside what appeared
to be, and what they've now discovered to be, a

177
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,454
mind flayer or an illithid. They managed to, upon
looking deeper into this cavern, finding hidden

178
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:02,589
behind a waterfall, thanks to the druid and the
ranger, completely stealing from the rest of the

179
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,835
group their flying carpet, made a very tenuous
relationship and alignment with another mind

180
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:14,781
flayer, apparently cast out of his own society,
searching to find a way to both get revenge and

181
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:20,871
find his way back into his colony of people. And
his name was Clarota, lovingly called Clarence by

182
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:26,255
the group, probably much to his own chagrin. After
which they decided to go ahead and try to extract

183
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:33,185
information from this duergar general, and stop
this war camp from preparing itself for battle and

184
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:39,567
attack, seemingly, on Kraghammer in the near
future. Through a strange, crazy plan

185
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:44,372
they came up with, they managed to fly undetected
over via flying carpet and eagle, and floating

186
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:49,544
sorcerer, over the entire war camp, made a Metal
Gear run into the center of their main barracks--

187
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:50,947
(all laugh)

188
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:55,843
MATT: -- threw a bucket of goblin shit into the
face of the one mind flayer--

189
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:56,857
ASHLEY: Whoops.

190
00:17:56,857 --> 00:18:02,150
MATT: -- after which, Vax bisected it, pretty
much, in one surprise round of attacks that led to

191
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:08,607
a large battle in the center of this building,
partway through which ground began to rumble. And

192
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:13,132
then digging a forth from underneath, a bulette, a
gargantuan armored, burrowing creature that was

193
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:18,084
hungry and very dangerous that then made the
battle that much more intense. A heavy,

194
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:23,213
blood-filled battle later, involved with Percy
getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet

195
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:29,320
of the beast, eventually it had its armor pulled
apart and was defeated by the party. The remnants

196
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:33,407
of the duergar army inside of this building have
been destroyed, aside from a few stragglers who

197
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:37,731
have laid their weapons down, and the general now
lies beaten, on his knees before the rest of the

198
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:43,201
party. And that is where we pick up and begin. So,
as you all are catching your breath, breathing

199
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:47,677
heavily, as the adrenaline slowly leaves the
system. Looking around this building, with the

200
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:50,964
large hole still glaring through the roof.

201
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,967
ORION: I'm waving through it.

202
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:54,966
MATT: Tiberius is waving through it.

203
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,124
LAURA: Oh, you're still up top.

204
00:18:56,124 --> 00:19:02,076
MATT: The general's on the ground, warhammer at
his side, blackened armor still kind of sizzling

205
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:08,084
with the arcane energy from his temporary
Banishment via Scanlan. He sits there with this

206
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:13,055
kind of gnarled, brackish beard, looking about the
rest of you with these wild kind of white-coated

207
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:24,312
eyes. "So you found your way in. What's your
purpose? What do you want from me?"

208
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:28,344
LIAM: Well, Vax walks right up to him and walks
behind him and grabs him by the hair, and right

209
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:32,370
back to this position. Let's have a talk.

210
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,456
LAURA: Oh.

211
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:34,965
LIAM: Would you care to have a chat?

212
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,272
LAURA: Of course I would, thank you.

213
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:39,244
MATT: "If you want blood, take it. It's all you're
getting from me."

214
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,303
TRAVIS: Okay, kill him.

215
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,678
ALL: No, wait!

216
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,027
ORION: Hold on a second, ask the question.

217
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,289
LAURA: We don't want your blood.

218
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,444
ORION: What are we asking?

219
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:49,110
LAURA: We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen
one?

220
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,690
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about."

221
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,392
LAURA: A female halfling. She came down here.

222
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,162
MATT: "Well, she wouldn't have gotten far if she
did. Not with my people."

223
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:03,212
LIAM: I take my dagger and stick it in about a
centimeter and say, your master is gone, it's just

224
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:11,334
you and your friends here now, I think it's in
your best interest to talk. You could walk away

225
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:15,667
from here. You don't have to die if you can play
nicely.

226
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,432
ORION: And believe me when I tell you he usually
kills everybody.

227
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:21,333
He doesn't give that offer very often.

228
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,712
(all laugh)

229
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:27,072
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll with
advantage.

230
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,480
TRAVIS: First roll of the night. First roll of the
night.

231
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,049
ORION: Yeah!

232
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:30,025
LIAM: Natural 20!

233
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,078
(all laugh and cheer)

234
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,606
MATT: That's a way to start.

235
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,144
MARISHA: The first one tonight!

236
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:36,471
LAURA: That's the way!

237
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,238
TRAVIS: Probably those eight miles you rode.

238
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,272
ORION: Shush!

239
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:45,151
MATT: As you pull the blade to his throat, he
chuckles deeply against the strain. "Your halfling

240
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:54,736
"lass was foolish. We took her. We delivered her to
King Murghol as a present. If she lives, she's

241
00:20:54,736 --> 00:21:00,852
"probably ruined and broken deep within the
dungeons of Emberhold.

242
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,941
"You're welcome to go for her there."

243
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,613
LIAM: Who's this king of yours?

244
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:05,702
LAURA: King what?

245
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:06,747
MARISHA: Murgholt?

246
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:07,976
MATT: "Murghol."

247
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,539
ORION: Which way should we head?

248
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,170
MATT: "Ooh, down, probably."

249
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,916
ORION: I mean, is there any particular shortcuts
or less running into

250
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,640
your kind along the way, I suppose?

251
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,912
MATT: "I highly doubt it." He spits in your
direction.

252
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,534
ORION: Oh! Prestidigitation. And I catch it and
throw it back into his face.

253
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,177
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he's
lying about that?

254
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,227
MATT: Go for it.

255
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,466
TALIESIN: I think we have some prisoners to free
or something as well.

256
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,741
LAURA: Yes.

257
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:44,665
MARISHA: 22.

258
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:55,398
MATT: He does not appear to be lying about his
interpretation of her, apparently she is where he

259
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,078
is. As to where her current state is, you don't
know, but he seems to have a very, very made-up

260
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:02,797
mind as to her possibility of her being alive
still.

261
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:08,676
MARISHA: What about a secret path that we can
maybe get through to avoid some of these people?

262
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,779
Was kind of wondering if he's lying.

263
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,776
MATT: You can press him that information even
harder.

264
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:18,156
MARISHA: Hey guys, we should press him for
information about this passage.

265
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:19,940
LIAM: Just a couple of more questions.

266
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,773
LAURA: Can I start speaking to him in Underdark?

267
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:23,714
MATT: Of course.

268
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:24,736
LAURA: And I ask him--

269
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:25,658
MARISHA: That's hot.

270
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:31,862
LAURA: Yep, it's an awesome language. Tell me
about the hidden passages. I know there are some.

271
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,118
I am good tonight, you guys

272
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,229
TRAVIS: What does Underdark sound like, by the
way?

273
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,398
(all laugh)

274
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:36,482
LAURA: It sounds kind of like--

275
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:37,277
TALIESIN: Parseltongue?

276
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,089
LIAM: It's like Pig Latin.

277
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,664
LAURA: (speaking Undercommon)

278
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:40,920
TRAVIS: Mm, no!

279
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,200
LIAM: Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay?

280
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,096
MATT: It's kind of reminiscent of Black Speech
from the Tolkien universe, that has that guttural

281
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,231
(speaking Black Speech) very, very deep.

282
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,294
LAURA: Oh right, that.

283
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:53,588
ALL: (speaking Black Speech)

284
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:56,630
MATT: A little bit like a whispering darkness to
it. As she speaks this tongue, it catches a lot of

285
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,531
you off guard, you've not heard her use this
tongue until this point.

286
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,608
Make an intimidation check.

287
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:05,981
ASHLEY: (gasps) Vex, what are you doing? What is
this coming out of your mouth?

288
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:09,054
TRAVIS: That sounds real pretty.

289
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,273
LAURA: Right, I have my papers.

290
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:11,228
MATT: Get your sheet ready.

291
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:12,756
LAURA: Oh noes, hold on, hold on.

292
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,049
MATT: You got your paper today? Lovely.

293
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,113
LIAM: She's bonafide.

294
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,393
LAURA: 18.

295
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:28,479
MATT: 18. He says, "No passages to the stronghold,
but there is a way in. Aside from the front. Good

296
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:31,606
"luck getting up in there from that point."

297
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:36,025
ASHLEY: Is it through the lake?

298
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:42,734
MATT: "Yes, through the lake. Deep below, you'll
find a tunnel. This tunnel will lead you to a

299
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:46,222
"subterranean passage straight to the stronghold."

300
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,100
LAURA: Can we check to make sure he's not
untruthful?

301
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,150
MATT: Make an insight.

302
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:56,416
LAURA: (groans) Okay. 16?

303
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,063
MATT: No, he's bullshitting through his teeth.

304
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,690
LAURA: Oh, okay.

305
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,983
LIAM: Vex'ahlia?

306
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,771
MATT: Hey, he seemed honest about the passage but
dishonest about the-- he's basically following her

307
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,590
lead. "Uh-huh."

308
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,917
LAURA: You're lying.

309
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,528
MATT: "Perhaps."

310
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,194
LAURA: Tell us true, where is it?

311
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:17,178
MATT: "If I tell you, will you let me live?"

312
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,694
TRAVIS: Ooh. Well.

313
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,219
TALIESIN: I think that's very reasonable.

314
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,489
LAURA: I think that's reasonable. We'll--

315
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:22,646
MATT: "I'm essentially--"

316
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:24,004
TALIESIN: We will not kill you.

317
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,951
LAURA: I think we can--

318
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,420
TRAVIS: We can lock him up. And then kill him.

319
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,606
LIAM: We'll leave you alive.

320
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,029
LAURA: We'll leave you alive.

321
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:29,975
LIAM: Yes.

322
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:32,657
MATT: "Don't just leave me alive. Give me a chance
to walk from this building,

323
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,292
"on my own, arms intact."

324
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,274
TRAVIS: No.

325
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:40,271
MATT: "And I'll give you the secret entrance to
Emberhold itself,

326
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,489
"leading you straight within the throne room."

327
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,106
ORION: Well, that's a good thing.

328
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:47,795
TALIESIN: So we have to leave you alive, and let
you leave this building intact?

329
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,605
MATT: "Correct."

330
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:56,059
TRAVIS: I go over and pick up his warhammer and
say, you may-- maybe-- leave.

331
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,946
But I get to keep this as a souvenir.

332
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,303
TALIESIN: I actually think this is an appropriate
moment to play with a bit of banditry. I say we

333
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:07,035
take everything from him and he can make his way
out all on his own.

334
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:07,911
TRAVIS: I like that idea.

335
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:08,721
LAURA: Yeah--

336
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,571
MARISHA: Ooh, that's fun.

337
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:10,406
LAURA: -- all his clothes, everything.

338
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:11,398
TRAVIS: Butt naked.

339
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:12,499
LIAM: And you can advise--

340
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,485
MARISHA: Wait, wait, hang on.

341
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:14,733
ORION: As is his undergarments on for--

342
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,857
TRAVIS: Why?

343
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:16,962
ORION: I don't care to see that.

344
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:20,142
MARISHA: Why don't we take him with us? Just in
casies--

345
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:27,121
MATT: At which point, a cold, clammy hand touches
your shoulder and pulls you aside as--

346
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:27,867
MARISHA: Ew.

347
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:34,515
MATT: -- a partially hooded Clarota steps forward
and says, "I'll attempt to read his surface

348
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:40,552
"thoughts. If he tries to keep it from me, I'll
know."

349
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:43,502
TRAVIS: Smart, smart!

350
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:50,238
MATT: As he steps forward, he puts one hand in front of him
and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue. You

351
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:58,194
can see the general tips his head back for a
second and begins twitching an eye. Sweat begins

352
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:03,933
to bead around his brow as Clarota takes another
step forward, tensing his hand once more, his head

353
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:09,577
beginning to bow forward with an intensity, a
force of focus towards his direction. You can now

354
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:17,632
see the general, "Let me live. Let me go and I'll
tell you. This isn't necessary. I'm willing to

355
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:19,848
"give you the information." You can see a trickle
of blood

356
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,651
begin to pour out of one of his nostrils.

357
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:22,805
TRAVIS: Yeah.

358
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:24,594
ORION: That's a mind flayer.

359
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:27,251
LAURA: What do we do? I think we should stop him.
Should we stop him?

360
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,531
LIAM: Clarota.

361
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:29,367
LAURA: Wait.

362
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:35,604
LIAM: Does he know anything about K'varn?

363
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:41,206
MATT: "Let me see." And the mind flayer pushes
once more into his brain. You see a twitch to his

364
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:45,433
face as his head kind of lolls back and rolls for
a second, resisting as best he can. But his will

365
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:50,278
is currently being beaten by the defeat of the
battle, the lack of his compatriot mind flayer,

366
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:56,548
and the sheer intensity of Clarota now focused on
vengeance and returning to his people. The blood

367
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,362
beings to stream not just from his nostrils, but
from his ears as well. As Clarota releases him for

368
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:11,458
a second, he goes, "He has not seen K'varn, but
knows a bit of his nature. I cannot read it, but

369
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:17,525
we could press for more information."

370
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:18,478
LIAM: I walk up--

371
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:19,909
LAURA: I think we should just ask him.

372
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:25,637
LIAM: -- next to Clarota, push the dwarf against
the wall, and say, our friend here is not as

373
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:35,693
patient as I am. We want to know about this
K'varn, and we want you and all your men, all your

374
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:42,588
little mates here, to throw your weapons into the
chasm, you can go fuck off, but we want to know

375
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:47,891
everything. And this is your last chance. Right
now, right here. Talk.

376
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:49,271
TRAVIS: And you have to get naked.

377
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:50,613
LAURA: (whispers) And you have to get naked.

378
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:51,766
LIAM: That's correct.

379
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:52,832
ORION: Will you stop with the naked? Grog--

380
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:53,823
TRAVIS: What?

381
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:54,943
TALIESIN: I'm with you on that.

382
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:55,908
TRAVIS: Thank you.

383
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:56,921
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

384
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,782
MARISHA: It's starting to become a thing now. I'm
just saying.

385
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:09,191
MATT: "K'varn was responsible for forging the
alliance. For centuries and generations, his

386
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:19,675
"people and mine killed and fought. It wasn't until
K'varn came that we decided to work together for a

387
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:31,066
"common cause. Expansion, unification, dominion
over this land and these mountains. Divided, we

388
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:43,007
"were weak, petty, greedy. With K'varn leading us,
we have purpose, we have growth. We could take

389
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:48,781
"what we'd like, and I'm but one dwarf. If I fall
over here,

390
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,831
"many more will take over where I fell."

391
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:58,957
TALIESIN: Well, we can see that's obviously worked
out really well for you. I think that I'm

392
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:01,034
satisfied, are you satisfied?

393
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,469
LAURA: What kind of creature is K'varn?

394
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,012
LIAM: What is K'varn?

395
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:06,334
MATT: "I have not seen K'varn personally."

396
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:08,530
LAURA: But you've heard rumors, though?

397
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,935
MATT: "What I know of K'varn-- a being of immense
intelligence. A creature that needs not walk this

398
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:24,139
"earth, one that does not touch the land that it
traverses. I know it sees all, it smiles from a

399
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:33,668
"toothy maw and laughs, laughs in the darkness.
Protruding from its forehead, one nasty, gnarled

400
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:44,684
"black horn, terrible source of its dark power.
That is what's beneath here."

401
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,205
LAURA: Is he telling the truth?

402
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:47,352
MATT: Insight check.

403
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,960
LIAM: Insight check for me as well.

404
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,104
TALIESIN: Would I recognize this creature he's
describing?

405
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:59,422
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check. Or arcana,
either one.

406
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,717
MARISHA: Can I assist him?

407
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,870
TALIESIN: Or arcana? 14.

408
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,238
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

409
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:04,968
MATT: This'll be more for your own personal
knowledge, probably not.

410
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:05,928
But you can make one yourself.

411
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:07,266
MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm saying.

412
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,186
TALIESIN: 14.

413
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:10,398
MARISHA: 'Cause you're doing arcana?

414
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:11,350
TALIESIN: I did arcana.

415
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,684
ORION: A d20 roll.

416
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:17,872
MARISHA: I'm doing nature. 29, nature.

417
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:26,797
MATT: All right, so. No natural creature you've
ever heard has this type of essence to it,

418
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:29,299
having a single black horn.

419
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,431
LIAM: It's clearly a narwhal.

420
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,303
MATT: It is.

421
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:33,423
LIAM: It's a sentient narwhal.

422
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,564
MATT: It's an awful, awful narwhal. Way to spoil
the story, Liam.

423
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,053
MARISHA: Demon narwhal.

424
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,481
ASHLEY: (singsong) Well, maybe we should go.

425
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:46,941
MATT: Gnashing teeth, black horn, very
intelligent. That doesn't seem to be anything from

426
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:52,304
nature itself. From your experience, there are
different entities, but usually there are multiple

427
00:30:52,304 --> 00:30:57,586
horns. Singular, demonic beings that would have
extreme intelligence, sharp teeth, horns, and

428
00:30:57,586 --> 00:31:01,942
you've had brief brushes in the past with demonic
entities that seems to run in a similar vein, but

429
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:08,861
nothing in particular is creeping into mind. It's
going to be difficult for you to specifically come

430
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:16,597
up with this, with what little information you
currently have. Yeah.

431
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:18,930
ORION: Well, I'm satisfied.

432
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,928
LIAM: I am, too.

433
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:21,115
LAURA: Maybe we should let him go.

434
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:21,969
LIAM: Why don't you strip?

435
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:22,759
ORION: I agree.

436
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,631
TRAVIS: Do you wanna handcuff him?

437
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,601
ASHLEY: Take off your clothes!

438
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,671
LAURA: Yeah, let's take his-- We take Grog's
handcuffs out of his bag.

439
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:29,523
MATT: "Let me-- That was not the deal! You leave
me, unspoiled, on my life,

440
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:31,934
"and I tell you the way into Emberhold."

441
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,006
LAURA: Well, tell us!

442
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,301
ORION: Take the hammer. That's rough on him. Leave
his armor on.

443
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,352
LAURA: You haven't told us yet, have you?

444
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:41,138
LIAM: We already told you your weapons are ours.

445
00:31:41,138 --> 00:31:44,795
TALIESIN: In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons,
your armor, and I believe, your pride.

446
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,114
MARISHA: Yes.

447
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,758
LAURA: But your life is yours.

448
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:53,436
TALIESIN: You may even outrun the dwarves we're
about to set free.

449
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:55,400
ORION and TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah.

450
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,165
TRAVIS: Nice! Percy's fucked-up tonight, I like
it.

451
00:31:58,165 --> 00:31:59,593
TALIESIN: I'm in a mood.

452
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:00,665
MATT: "Emberhold."

453
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,096
LIAM: He tried to make a book out of someone's
flesh once.

454
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,433
LAURA: Wait, wait. He's telling us, shut up.

455
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,330
LIAM: Yes, sorry.

456
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,542
MATT: "Emberhold is the fortress of our people,
built to resist assault from all sides."

457
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,513
LIAM: Shite.

458
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:16,921
MATT: "We've an army, hiding about the outskirts
of it. Kind of like an army you might have in one

459
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:25,987
"of yours, if you think you have a chance. However,
since I don't think that's what you carry, your

460
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:33,695
"best bet is on the left side of the fortress.
There are two streams of molten rock that pour

461
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:41,484
"down the side. The smaller of those two streams
covers a secret tunnel."

462
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:46,925
LIAM: Insight check. Is he full of shit? I
rolled-- Oh, nothing too hot at all. Never mind,

463
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,359
forget it. Forget I said anything.

464
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:56,132
MATT: All right. He seems to be forthright and
honest with his information. "However, that'll

465
00:32:56,132 --> 00:33:01,250
"take you through the lava. That's up to you. It's
meant to open from the inside. A trapdoor-like

466
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:08,306
"mechanism that spreads the actual flow. From the
outside, well, good luck.

467
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:15,245
"I've done my side of the bargain. Let me free."

468
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,996
LIAM: Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut
his belt loose and let his pants fall,

469
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,140
and I give him a little nudge.

470
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,974
MATT: Okay.

471
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:26,512
LAURA: You're free to go. Not toward your
stronghold, but towards the surface.

472
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:29,458
MATT: So his belt falls, changepurse, and
everything.

473
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,019
He is wearing full plate black armor--

474
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:31,960
LIAM: Sure.

475
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,418
MATT: So his trousers do not plummet.

476
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:34,656
LIAM: Aw, that's a shame.

477
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:36,109
TRAVIS: Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a
porpoise?

478
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:40,241
MATT: He picks up his warhammer.

479
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:47,533
TRAVIS: I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a
token to remember you by.

480
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:50,113
MATT: "Unspoiled was the deal."

481
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,363
LIAM: Wasn't the deal.

482
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,930
TRAVIS: No, it's great. You can really argue all
you want to,

483
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,928
or I'll just smash your fucking head in.

484
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:55,982
LIAM: Wasn't the deal!

485
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,385
TALIESIN: Alive was the deal.

486
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:00,590
LIAM: We said you were alive, your weapons were
ours. What, have you got shit in your ears?

487
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,127
ORION: I thought you meant you wouldn't get dirty,
like you know, not spoiled.

488
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:07,080
Which I was totally fine with.

489
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,191
MATT: Takes a couple of steps forward towards you,
holding the warhammer out.

490
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:13,445
LIAM: Your skull is unspoiled.

491
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:18,200
MATT: Suddenly, he turns completely invisible,
vanishes from sight.

492
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,593
LAURA: My perception's really high, can I try to
find him?

493
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,233
LIAM: Yeah, we can. Perception check.

494
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:24,175
TRAVIS: You dicks.

495
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,339
MATT: You hear (footsteps running).

496
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,270
LIAM: Perception check.

497
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,106
LAURA: Wait, no!

498
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,825
ORION: He's gone.

499
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:28,526
LAURA: Mother bitch.

500
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:29,260
MARISHA: It's fine.

501
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,242
LIAM: 18 for me.

502
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,073
MARISHA: Just let him go, it's all he's got.

503
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:32,939
ASHLEY: We should throw something.

504
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,485
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I want the hammer!

505
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:36,547
MARISHA: It's all he's got right now. He's naked,
and now he's invisible running through a cavern.

506
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:37,174
LAURA: He's not naked!

507
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:38,209
MATT: At this point--

508
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,429
LIAM: I'm gonna attack him.

509
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,620
MATT: Before you have the opportunity--

510
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,649
LIAM: Yeah?

511
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,559
MATT: -- he becomes visible again, about 20 feet
out, gone down the stairs

512
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,795
and towards the front door and he just--

513
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:46,818
LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger at him.

514
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,529
MARISHA: Oh look.

515
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:48,361
MATT: Go for it.

516
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:48,946
LIAM: Yeah.

517
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:50,348
TRAVIS: And I'm throwing my ax at him with the
chain of returning as well.

518
00:34:50,348 --> 00:34:52,525
LIAM: Oh good, that's great. 28 for me.

519
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,253
ORION: Oh shit.

520
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:54,557
MATT: All right, that hits.

521
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:55,529
LIAM: Yeah, sure it does. Dick!

522
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,620
MATT: It's not a Sneak Attack, just damage.

523
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,218
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine.

524
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:58,124
MATT: You chuck your ax at him.

525
00:34:58,124 --> 00:34:58,898
TRAVIS: 17.

526
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:00,321
MARISHA: And I just yell, sorry!

527
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,650
MATT: Okay.

528
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,454
TRAVIS: 17.

529
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:03,637
LIAM: Ten for me.

530
00:35:03,637 --> 00:35:05,039
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage for
both of you.

531
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:05,894
LIAM: Ten.

532
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,863
MATT: He is there, standing in place with his arms
locked like this.

533
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:10,317
LAURA: Oh, Clarota.

534
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,460
TRAVIS: 15.

535
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,239
MATT: 15 damage?

536
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,061
TRAVIS: Yeah.

537
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:14,711
MATT: All righty.

538
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:15,678
TRAVIS: Should've left the hammer.

539
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:16,558
LIAM: Ten.

540
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:19,644
MATT: Ten damage, all right. There's now a
significant amount of blood beginning to pool down

541
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:26,199
his feet, as he's standing there. As he is frozen
in place, Clarota just kinda steps up to the front

542
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,240
of him, grabs his cheeks and pulls his head in
towards him, as his tendrils slowly wrap around

543
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,736
his head. You can see them meet at the back of his
skull, and with this horrible crunching sound, you

544
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:42,066
see his head shudder, as his limbs go limp.

545
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:44,253
LIAM: (sings) Do do do do doo, I'm lovin' it.

546
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,178
(all laugh)

547
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,954
MATT: A few moments of this horrible slurping
sound--

548
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:48,733
LAURA: Oh no.

549
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:56,056
MATT: -- and you hear this dull, sickening, hollow
(suction) sound. The tentacles release, Clarota

550
00:35:56,056 --> 00:36:00,235
releases his grip from his head, and the captain
falls onto his back,

551
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:03,096
a giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull.

552
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,335
ASHLEY: He ate his brain?

553
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:05,969
TRAVIS: I guess you should've left the hammer,
shouldn't you?

554
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,721
TALIESIN: Some people are terrible losers, just
really terrible.

555
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:09,029
ORION: I'm going to loot the body.

556
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:11,046
LAURA: Yeah, well. Yeah, we definitely do that.

557
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:12,596
TRAVIS: I would like to pick up the hammer.

558
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,556
MARISHA: This is a good lesson, to no one else
that's watching.

559
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:16,183
ORION: Clarota, that was incredible. Well done!

560
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:16,921
LAURA: Clarota--

561
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,017
ASHLEY: Clarota, I am a fan.

562
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:19,579
MARISHA: No one is watching this valuable lesson.

563
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,180
TALIESIN: Do not be an oathbreaker.

564
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,516
MARISHA: To not be an oathbreaker.

565
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:23,690
TALIESIN: Know when you've lost your clothes.

566
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,827
LAURA: Was that actually, like, a meal for you?

567
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:28,821
MATT: As you're looking, you can see there's that
kind of weird purplish crimson around his

568
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:31,764
tendrils, as he kinda wipes it off with his hands,
and goes,

569
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:37,680
"It's enough to sustain me a while. I 
was getting hungry."

570
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,815
LAURA: Well. Better him than us, I say.

571
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:41,574
TRAVIS: Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer.

572
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,851
ORION: Yes, indeed.

573
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,591
LAURA: Loot the body!

574
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:49,303
MATT: Yes, so you loot the body. You find amongst
all the duergar bodies here, as you're quickly

575
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:52,251
jumping around and grabbing, it's hard to count
the exact amount, but you're looking at somewhere

576
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,324
in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred
gold pieces. You'll have to check later.

577
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:56,288
LAURA: Ooh!

578
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,196
LIAM: Mm-hm.

579
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:58,155
LAURA: I write that down.

580
00:36:58,155 --> 00:36:59,201
ORION: He was a general.

581
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:01,659
MATT: A series of black iron weapons. None of them
seem to, at a quick glance, have any sort of

582
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:07,307
magical value. The blackened plate armor on the
duergar itself does radiate a magical essence, as

583
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,366
does the warhammer he was holding.

584
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:11,207
LAURA: Is it just him wearing the black plate
armor--

585
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:11,939
MATT: Yeah.

586
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,039
LAURA: -- or any of the other bodies wearing it,
too?

587
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,643
MATT: There are a few that are wearing black
plate, but they're not equivalent enchanted.

588
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:18,395
LAURA: We should take that and put it in the bag
of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to.

589
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:19,218
TRAVIS: Okay.

590
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:20,900
LIAM: Tiberius, can you tell us anything about
these things?

591
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,491
LAURA: How many sets were there?

592
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,594
MATT: From what is in here, that would be 11 sets,
total.

593
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,769
ORION: Yes, that hammer is amazing, obviously,
because we saw it in action.

594
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,013
I'd say Grog should have it.

595
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,461
LAURA: 11 sets of armor!

596
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,614
MATT: Because there were also sets that were on
the rack at the very front.

597
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:32,409
LAURA: Nice!

598
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:33,301
ASHLEY: Hey.

599
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,410
MARISHA: Is Grog about to get a new weapon?

600
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,489
TRAVIS: 11 sets of armor, okay.

601
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,700
ORION: And I'll do an arcana check, right? An
arcana check on the stuff?

602
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,598
MATT: An arcana check, yeah.

603
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:40,338
TALIESIN: Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I
gave you, by the way.

604
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:41,008
LAURA: I did?

605
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,929
ORION: 23.

606
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,245
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got it-- you now have a trap
arrow.

607
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,158
LAURA: A grappler arrow?

608
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:45,971
TALIESIN: Yeah, you fire it and it prones
somebody.

609
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:48,086
LAURA: Seriously? That's so cool, thank you!

610
00:37:48,086 --> 00:37:49,078
MATT: There you go, sir.

611
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:50,178
TALIESIN: I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some
point.

612
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,236
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

613
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,041
TALIESIN: I know.

614
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,468
TRAVIS: Can you do a magical check on the-- Oh,
he's got it.

615
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:57,185
ORION: I did.

616
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:58,455
MATT: So, as Tiberius is looking over the
equipment,

617
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:01,462
kind of poring through his arcane knowledge.

618
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:07,365
ORION: Oh, oh, ooh! I think Pike and Grog would
benefit from these, most definitely. Here.

619
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:08,760
LAURA: What is it? What was it?

620
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,460
LIAM: There's not any kind of dark magic about the
armor, is there?

621
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,026
ORION: I mean, it's dark in color.

622
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,252
LIAM: Yes, that's fine.

623
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,185
ORION: But it's, you know, your standard arcana
magic.

624
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:20,248
ASHLEY: Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do
you also get their thoughts, maybe?

625
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,733
TRAVIS: Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance
to fire damage.

626
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,056
ASHLEY: Or it's just-- it's gone after that.

627
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:24,801
TRAVIS: The warhammer--

628
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:25,895
LIAM: Sh!

629
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:33,100
MATT: "There are residual memories, thoughts. It's
delicious." And you can see, there's this almost

630
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,014
rapturous look in his face you haven't seen
before. For a moment, Clarota looks a little

631
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:43,504
younger, a little stronger, a little more
dangerous. And you're put off a little bit by it.

632
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:45,117
TRAVIS: Clarota is Dracula.

633
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:48,545
MATT: But there's kind of this momentary kind of
relishing in the moment and--

634
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:57,311
MARISHA: Do we need to give you a moment alone? We
can leave.

635
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:01,308
MATT: "He speaks the truth about the path into the
Emberhold."

636
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:05,183
LAURA: All right.

637
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:10,719
LIAM: So, he spoke of some sort of trap door
that's easy to open from within,

638
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,741
but not from outside, correct?

639
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:14,779
MARISHA: It was hidden by a lava flow.

640
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,866
LAURA: Yes, two lava flows--

641
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:17,891
MATT: The smaller of the two.

642
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:19,025
LAURA: -- the smaller of the two.

643
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,027
LIAM: The smaller of the two.

644
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:20,965
MATT: On the left side.

645
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:21,963
MARISHA: On the left side of the keep.

646
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:22,897
LAURA: Yes. Can I ask a question?

647
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:23,627
MATT: Yes?

648
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,500
TRAVIS: I'm raising my hand.

649
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,734
LAURA: Are there a lot of other soldiers still in
the camp, or did we--

650
00:39:25,734 --> 00:39:27,950
MATT: Oh, there are plenty of soldiers still in
the camp.

651
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,586
LIAM: Yeah, we--

652
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:29,316
LAURA: Ooh.

653
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,847
MATT: You stealthed into the barracks.

654
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:35,324
LAURA: Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you
guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog?

655
00:39:35,324 --> 00:39:36,998
LIAM: Well, he was about to walk out the door and
cause mayhem.

656
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:37,904
ORION: That's true.

657
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:39,167
MARISHA: That's true. He was gonna alert
everybody.

658
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,800
TRAVIS: Can I harvest any natural armor from the
bulette? The kitty?

659
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,712
LAURA: Ooh!

660
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:46,533
MATT: You can certainly try. There's plates that
have been broken and cracked.

661
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,529
You can try and start cleaving away at it.

662
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:51,721
TRAVIS: All right, yes, I start butchering, or
something, the bulette.

663
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:55,512
MATT: Okay, you start-- It's really tough hide.
You know, 'cause you tried to cut through before

664
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:59,830
and you managed to make a few marks. It takes you
a few minutes. You manage to get, let's say, about

665
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:06,813
three saucer-shaped pieces of armor out of it.

666
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:08,005
TRAVIS: All right.

667
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:12,408
MATT: You could definitely get more, but then you
start hearing bells going off.

668
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:13,554
LAURA and TRAVIS: Shit.

669
00:40:13,554 --> 00:40:15,014
ORION: What do I see? I'm still on the roof.

670
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:16,365
LAURA: Okay, we should all-- Can we all--

671
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:19,840
MATT: You don't see anything yet. You just hear
bells starting to go off in the city.

672
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,427
LAURA: Okay, we should all put on black armor.
Does that matter?

673
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:25,762
LIAM: We should just get out of here. Keyleth, can
you fucking eagle up and let's go.

674
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,081
MATT: You start hearing horns.

675
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,445
LAURA: We need to free those dwarves.

676
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:29,181
MARISHA: Eagle up?

677
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:32,384
MATT: Big horns. You start seeing torches being
lit.

678
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:33,956
LAURA: Stealth, stealth. And get out. Go stealth
and get out.

679
00:40:33,956 --> 00:40:35,054
LIAM: We need to get out, now.

680
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:36,456
ORION: Oh guys, the jig is up!

681
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:38,313
LAURA: I shoot my grapple thing and go up out of
the ceiling.

682
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,328
LIAM: Tiberius.

683
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:40,080
ORION: What?

684
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,814
LIAM: Cast Fly on this fucker right here, we need
to get out of here.

685
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,860
We just need to get out the way we came in.

686
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:52,141
MARISHA: I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone
stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle

687
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:53,780
and I scoop up the gnomes.

688
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,606
MATT: Okay, what's the radius on Pass Without A
Trace?

689
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:58,843
LIAM: Like a thousand yards.

690
00:40:58,843 --> 00:40:59,711
MARISHA: Like a hundred yards.

691
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:02,142
MATT: Four miles, it's all I got.

692
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:06,523
LAURA: But I take the dust of tracelessness out of
the bag of holding

693
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:08,376
and I sprinkle it around the room.

694
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:14,307
MATT: Okay.

695
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:16,227
LAURA: Can we grapple up out from the ceiling?

696
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:19,341
MATT: Well, the arrow that you have that he made,
it's essentially an arrow that bursts into a

697
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:21,981
tanglefoot bag. When it bursts, it grapples
whoever's there,

698
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,258
it's not like grappling an arrow.

699
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:24,631
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not like a string arrow,
although I'll build that.

700
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:25,606
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a grappling--

701
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:26,890
TALIESIN: It's a trip arrow.

702
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,740
LAURA: Oh, that's cool, okay.

703
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,943
MARISHA: A 30-foot radius.

704
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:30,115
TALIESIN: I'll make you a grappling-- I didn't
follow that though.

705
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,667
I'll make you a grappling arrow.

706
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,295
LAURA: I have a grappling hook. Yeah, we should
grapple out.

707
00:41:33,295 --> 00:41:34,594
MATT: 30-foot radius, okay, so you could just--

708
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:35,446
MARISHA: Just, hug me.

709
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:36,466
MATT: -- barely get Tiberius in there if you--

710
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:37,419
MARISHA: Stay close.

711
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:38,327
TRAVIS: You can go on my back.

712
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:39,372
MATT: On the platform, so yeah.

713
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,731
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm gonna jump on Grog's back.

714
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,281
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I pick up Scanlan under my arm.

715
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,954
LAURA: We have a regular grappling hook, we'll
just get up out of the--

716
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:45,209
TALIESIN: We have a flying carpet.

717
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,342
ASHLEY: And hold onto some straps.

718
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:51,374
MATT: All right, so Scanlan-- Both gnomes get
grabbed by Keyleth as--

719
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:54,167
ORION: And we're all on the carpet?

720
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,895
LIAM: The carpet's away, but this guy is flying?

721
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:57,646
ORION: Yes.

722
00:41:57,646 --> 00:41:58,554
LIAM: Flying Grog.

723
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,876
TRAVIS: I am? I thought we were all-- Okay.

724
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,235
LIAM: No, you can't go on the carpet. You're too
heavy.

725
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:02,241
LAURA: What are we doing?

726
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:03,676
LIAM: We're going up. Straight up.

727
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:06,281
LAURA: Up and out. Can we stealth, while we do
it?

728
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:08,654
MATT: So, you guys, right now, as you're carrying
the two gnomes,

729
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:11,745
all of you except for Grog are on the carpet, 
correct?

730
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:12,782
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm flying.

731
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:17,959
MATT: You're flying. Okay, so how many spells do
you have left on that? One left? All right.

732
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,538
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

733
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,950
TALIESIN: Trinket's back on the other side.

734
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,609
MATT: Trinket's back on the other side. Trinket
didn't come with you to the battle, because there

735
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:23,806
was nobody to get Trinket across.

736
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:25,039
LAURA: Oh, he's just on the other side by himself,
all lonely?

737
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:25,987
MATT: Yeah, I know.

738
00:42:25,987 --> 00:42:26,839
LIAM: He's in goblin town.

739
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,643
MATT: Eh, you weren't here.

740
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:29,820
(all laugh)

741
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,311
MATT: You weren't here to protect your bear.

742
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,141
LAURA: That's so terrible.

743
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:33,290
ASHLEY: He's safe over there?

744
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,531
MATT: Hopefully.

745
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:35,638
ASHLEY: Oh Trinket!

746
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:36,717
TRAVIS: He's been raging.

747
00:42:36,717 --> 00:42:43,013
MATT: Everyone, make a stealth check. With a plus
ten additional modifier

748
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:44,864
thanks to Keyleth's spell.

749
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:49,418
TRAVIS: Oh, awesome. That helped.

750
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:51,424
ORION: 20.

751
00:42:51,424 --> 00:42:52,258
ASHLEY: Oh, 20!

752
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:53,091
MARISHA: 18.

753
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:54,108
TRAVIS: Natural? Oh.

754
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,101
LAURA: Nice. Ooh, natural 20!

755
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:56,141
TALIESIN: 19.

756
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,030
TRAVIS: 19.

757
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,181
ASHLEY: 20.

758
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:00,724
LAURA and TRAVIS: Natural 20.

759
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:01,864
LAURA: 31 for me.

760
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:02,844
LIAM: 29.

761
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:08,473
MATT: All right, so you all take off. As you do,
you can see now, probably close to 30 or 40

762
00:43:08,473 --> 00:43:12,311
duergar have now begun rushing towards the
barracks in the center of that main open area

763
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:18,402
where that wooden platform was, where Scanlan
originally saw a mind flayer. As you rush up, you

764
00:43:18,402 --> 00:43:25,738
hear (speaks Undercommon). You hear it as
Undercommon, screaming, "There! Above, look!"

765
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:26,719
LAURA: Oh, they saw us.

766
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,093
ASHLEY: Maybe you should scream, like, no, they
went the other way!

767
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:29,618
LIAM: Just keep going up, up, up.

768
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:31,413
MATT: A stream of javelins comes firing up in your
direction.

769
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,989
LAURA: How did they see us? I thought we were
stealthed.

770
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,942
ORION: I see where it's coming and I shoot a
Fireball.

771
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:36,708
MATT: Okay.

772
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,204
LIAM: That's good, that's good.

773
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:39,352
MARISHA: Wait, what are you doing?

774
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:44,662
MATT: Okay, so there's a volley of javelins and a
Fireball streaking past. You'll be able to get ten

775
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:50,309
of them in that Fireball blast, go ahead and roll
for damage on that. However, for those that rolled

776
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:56,572
less than 20 on stealth, each of you are getting
three javelins each to you. So that's you two, and

777
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:57,982
Grog. What'd you roll again?

778
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:59,090
MARISHA: Less than 20.

779
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,889
ORION: 22.

780
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:09,629
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you three. So three javelins
against you, miss you entirely. Percy. Actually,

781
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:17,955
one more against you, Keyleth. That one does hit.
You take 14 points of piercing damage as the

782
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:21,021
javelin just gleans off the side of your giant
eagle torso.

783
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,371
MARISHA: (eagle noises)

784
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:31,182
MATT: Percy, that's a 21, an 18, and a 20. So you
take three javelins.

785
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:37,626
24 points of piercing damage.

786
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:38,775
TALIESIN: 24 points?

787
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:42,506
MATT: Yeah, 24 points total, as three javelins--
Two strike you off the shoulders and one actually

788
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:46,040
embeds itself partway into your waist and you have
to pull it out,

789
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,543
and probably dug a good six, seven inches in.

790
00:44:48,543 --> 00:44:49,715
ASHLEY: What are you at?

791
00:44:49,715 --> 00:44:50,973
TALIESIN: I'm at 15.

792
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:51,936
ASHLEY: 15?

793
00:44:51,936 --> 00:44:53,258
ORION: By the way, 41 points of fire damage.

794
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:55,080
TALIESIN: I was already really low.

795
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,172
TRAVIS: Take me instead.

796
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:57,183
LAURA: We haven't healed him yet.

797
00:44:57,183 --> 00:44:58,459
ASHLEY: Wait, we healed the other game. Even with
that?

798
00:44:58,459 --> 00:44:59,564
TALIESIN: Oh, did I fully heal?

799
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:00,961
MATT: All right, the three that are going towards
Grog--

800
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,819
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

801
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:03,466
MATT: That-- Natural 20. A 17, what's your AC?

802
00:45:03,466 --> 00:45:04,304
ASHLEY: No, it was like 24.

803
00:45:04,304 --> 00:45:05,226
TRAVIS: 18.

804
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:06,025
ASHLEY: 24 points.

805
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:07,022
MATT: That one misses, and the last one-- Yeah,
two natural 20s.

806
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:07,773
TALIESIN: Yeah.

807
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:08,574
ASHLEY: That was 24.

808
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:09,268
MATT: Not even joking.

809
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:10,195
LIAM: Double crits, oh.

810
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:11,013
MATT: All right, so--

811
00:45:11,013 --> 00:45:12,015
LAURA: Two crits against you?

812
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:12,955
LIAM: Good thing you got a thousand hit points.

813
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:14,469
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh no.

814
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:15,781
LIAM: That's the point of a meat tank.

815
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,114
MATT: You take a total of 36 points of piercing
damage, Grog.

816
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:19,988
ASHLEY: And he still has more hitpoints than we
do.

817
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:20,824
MATT: Yeah, probably.

818
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:21,586
MARISHA: Ouchies.

819
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,499
MATT: Oh, barbarian.

820
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:24,308
LIAM: If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind
all.

821
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:26,675
LAURA: He is here, technically.

822
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,486
MATT: He is here, Scanlan's holding on tight as--

823
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:29,735
LIAM: He's here, he's watching.

824
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,646
TALIESIN: Scanlan's peeing, peeing down.

825
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,714
MATT: However, as the javelins strike all you
guys, moments later there's a gargantuan

826
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:41,720
explosion, and there's a flash of reddish light
from below. A giant fiery blooming explosion

827
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,866
bursts into the center of that area. You can see
duergar thrown left and right. You manage to take

828
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,730
out about 12 of them in that one blast.

829
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,437
ORION: Yes!

830
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:49,275
LAURA: Nice!

831
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,323
LIAM: Yeah, home slice.

832
00:45:50,323 --> 00:45:53,349
MATT: You guys continue, cresting over the top.
You can now see more and more are starting to

833
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:56,763
gather, the bells are going off, the horns are
blowing hard. You can see a bunch of them are now

834
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:59,849
running over to what looks like some of this siege
equipment they had constructed--

835
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:00,931
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh.

836
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:04,031
MATT: Which includes a few large ballistae.

837
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,689
LIAM: I think we should friggin' dive bomb towards
the far tunnel past this war camp.

838
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:10,144
LAURA: No, but Trinket!

839
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:11,692
LIAM: Is fine, he's hiding out. They don't know
he's here.

840
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:12,772
TRAVIS: Leave him.

841
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:13,635
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

842
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:16,533
ORION: I'm not concerned with the bear right now!

843
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:18,285
LIAM: We're going to dive. Yes, dive bomb, dive
bomb!

844
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:21,246
TALIESIN: The bear can take care of himself.

845
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,837
LIAM: I take hold of the front of the carpet and
steer it up and over, along the roof and then down

846
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:26,180
towards the tunnel. I'm steering the carpet.

847
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:30,808
MATT: Okay. You guys are coming down. You
basically shot up, curved around--

848
00:46:30,892 --> 00:46:32,167
LAURA: We shouldn't go down.

849
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,737
MATT: And you're going backwards towards the
barracks. As you do, another volley of--

850
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:39,333
LAURA: We got to free those dwarves, y'all.

851
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,166
MATT: Another volley comes to the guys who were
under-stealthed.

852
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,701
LIAM: We don't have to. That seems complicated.

853
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:43,843
ORION: Who's not stealthed?

854
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,719
MATT: However, there is one attack less each
because of the duergar that you had taken out. So,

855
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:53,955
against Keyleth, one hits. You take 12 points of
piercing damage.

856
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:58,039
MARISHA: I am no longer an eagle.

857
00:46:58,039 --> 00:46:59,238
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

858
00:46:59,238 --> 00:47:00,218
TRAVIS: Oh shit, really?

859
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:01,718
MATT: All right, a two and a one versus Percy.

860
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,783
MARISHA: Yeah.

861
00:47:02,783 --> 00:47:04,143
TRAVIS: Are you paying attention?

862
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:05,045
ORION: Wait, what?

863
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:06,154
TRAVIS: She's not an eagle anymore.

864
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:06,829
MATT: All right, so.

865
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:07,743
LAURA: Keyleth isn't a--

866
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,082
MARISHA: I hit zero hit points as an eagle.

867
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:09,905
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you again?

868
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:10,738
LAURA: What happened?

869
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,156
LIAM: She's not an eagle and she's falling with
the gnomes.

870
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:16,864
MATT: Keyleth's form shifts back into that of
Keyleth. You guys are about 80 feet up.

871
00:47:16,864 --> 00:47:17,869
MARISHA: Help!

872
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:18,845
LAURA: Okay, okay!

873
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:19,808
ASHLEY: Can I--

874
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:23,036
MATT: At which point, both Scanlan and Pike go
into a free fall along with Keyleth.

875
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:23,841
ASHLEY: Wait, can I--

876
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,095
LAURA: No, no, she was on Grog, she was--

877
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,166
ORION: Are we under them? Are we under them?

878
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,047
LIAM: I don't know, are we?

879
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:27,975
ASHLEY: No, I was on her.

880
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:29,146
MATT: No, you guys are about parallel. You guys
were moving together.

881
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:29,901
LIAM: Parallel?

882
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:30,808
ORION: Go under them!

883
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:31,666
LAURA: Yeah, we dive under them.

884
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:32,719
LIAM: Dive, dive, dive, dive!

885
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,040
ORION: I cast Glacial Blast and I create a bridge
that scoops them up, right under them.

886
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,855
As we dive right under them.

887
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,200
LIAM: Party trick.

888
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,081
MATT: Okay, you guys are out in the middle of the
open cavern. There's no place to connect the

889
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:47,423
bridge, so you're essentially creating a giant
ice--

890
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,531
LIAM and LAURA: Chunk.

891
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:50,385
MATT: Chunk right beneath them. Which is also now
in freefall.

892
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:51,725
ORION: Huh? No!

893
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:52,515
MATT: Yes.

894
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:53,623
LIAM: Even wizards make mistakes.

895
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:54,666
ORION: Damn it!

896
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,730
MATT: So as you guys try and swoop underneath as
they're plummeting-- You're riding this, go ahead

897
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,741
and make an acrobatics check.

898
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:00,969
LIAM: Okay.

899
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:01,844
ORION: No, I didn't think of that.

900
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:02,940
MARISHA: I don't know what to do.

901
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,231
LAURA: Can we try to catch-- can we try to-- what
do I have?

902
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:05,427
ASHLEY: Wait, can I--

903
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,504
TRAVIS: Are we over the war camp, or are we over
the--

904
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:07,561
LIAM: 25.

905
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:08,456
LAURA: Over the war camp.

906
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:12,372
MATT: All right, so you swoop underneath. A sudden
motion, as you're trying to cast. Go ahead and

907
00:48:12,453 --> 00:48:13,910
roll a concentration check on this.

908
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,516
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Tiberius.

909
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:16,603
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

910
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:20,130
MARISHA: Oh, save my life, again, Tiberius.

911
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,043
ORION: Oh no.

912
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:21,861
LAURA: Can I try to--

913
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:22,576
MARISHA: Oh shit.

914
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:23,742
LIAM: I let go of the front of the carpet, I stick
a--

915
00:48:23,742 --> 00:48:25,979
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I cast War
God's Blessing to give him a plus ten?

916
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:26,975
MATT: Unfortunately, you're falling.

917
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:27,833
ASHLEY: Fuck.

918
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,139
MATT: You're like (worried noise), you're just
plummeting through the air like a rock because

919
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,288
you're in full plate armor.

920
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:33,408
LAURA: Can I use the rope of endless twine and try
to lasso one of them?

921
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:34,996
'Cause I'm really a good shot.

922
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,039
ASHLEY: How far are we falling?

923
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,738
MATT: You have to pull it out of the bag of
holding and then turn into a lasso, that's gonna

924
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:39,167
take you a full minute, so you don't have time.

925
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,045
LIAM: I have a rope. I let go of the front of the
carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's

926
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:46,664
hand, and I jump off towards Pike, holding it
around in one hand as I go--

927
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:47,665
LAURA: Oh god.

928
00:48:47,665 --> 00:48:48,604
TALIESIN: I grapple onto her to hold her down.

929
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:49,966
ASHLEY: No! No, no, no, I have so much armor.

930
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:50,902
LAURA: Okay, then you should--

931
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:53,297
MATT: All right guys, so here's what happens. In
the time this has transpired, you've rushed

932
00:48:53,297 --> 00:49:00,815
underneath with the magic carpet, all of you
barely managed to hold on, as both Pike and

933
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:05,064
Scanlan and Keyleth all slam into the top of
the--

934
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:07,171
LAURA: Oh okay, except you're dangling off of it
now by a rope.

935
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,031
MATT: You lost your concentration, so Glacial
Blast didn't go off, thankfully.

936
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,525
That would've been really bad.

937
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:12,420
MARISHA: Wait, wait, we slam into the top of
what?

938
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,314
TALIESIN: Us.

939
00:49:13,314 --> 00:49:15,427
MATT: You guys slam onto the top of the rest of
the group, in there.

940
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:17,086
LAURA: That's too many people on the carpet.

941
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:20,684
MATT: Because you lost your concentration, your
flight spell also dissipates.

942
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:21,803
Grog is now plummeting.

943
00:49:21,803 --> 00:49:22,545
LAURA: Oh no!

944
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:23,230
TRAVIS: Yay!

945
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,203
ALL: (worried noises)

946
00:49:26,203 --> 00:49:27,216
LAURA: We're gonna die!

947
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:29,263
MATT: The carpet now has too much weight and is
currently giving out.

948
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:32,292
LIAM: #savecriticalrole.

949
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:34,474
ORION: Get me close to him. I cast Featherfall on
you.

950
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:38,912
MATT: It's slowing your fall, but you guys are--
you're coming down at a very, very fast pace at an

951
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:41,942
angle over the barracks towards the back end of
the war camp.

952
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:42,769
LAURA: Oh shit.

953
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:46,505
MARISHA: Can I cast Wind Wall right underneath of
the carpet to kind of like airbend us up?

954
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,428
MATT: You can attempt to. Grog--

955
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:50,310
TRAVIS: I begin to fart to slow the fall.

956
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,341
ORION: Who needs Featherfall? I can do it in a
bunch!

957
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:53,279
MARISHA: Ahh!

958
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:54,457
MATT: Everybody, at this point--

959
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:55,296
LIAM: But wait, Dungeon Master?

960
00:49:55,296 --> 00:49:56,054
MATT: Yes.

961
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,873
LIAM: Re-explain what's happening. So the carpet
is falling, not as fast as it would, but--

962
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:02,077
MATT: Essentially, you guys are flying beside each
other, the three that were falling, you guys

963
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:06,443
swooped underneath and caught them, however it's
too much weight to bear, the carpet's now--

964
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:08,828
LIAM: How high are we at this second?

965
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:11,688
MATT: At this second, you're about 60-70 feet up.

966
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:12,421
MARISHA: Ohh.

967
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:14,536
LIAM: And the closest building, the highest
building under us is how tall?

968
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:15,530
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus.

969
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,242
MATT: It's about 15 feet tall.

970
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:19,340
LIAM: Ohh.

971
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,360
MATT: Grog, however, goes into a full plummet. You
guys have just caught the rest of them, you've all

972
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,967
caught them, you're crashing down.

973
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,765
MARISHA: And did the Wind Wall thing work?

974
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:31,862
MATT: Go ahead and roll a concentration.

975
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,228
LAURA: Everybody jump up in the air!

976
00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:34,736
MATT: Your constitution modifier.

977
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:41,296
MARISHA: Fucking shit. Not good. Seven.

978
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:46,286
MATT: The spell fizzles.

979
00:50:46,286 --> 00:50:49,517
LIAM: Unpause. How far are we from the tunnel that
we were talking about?

980
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:53,988
MATT: From what you can see here, you're probably
about 50 to 60 feet.

981
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,905
LAURA: We're right over the camp, aren't we?

982
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:59,125
MATT: You're towards the back of it, thankfully,
the barracks are towards the back of it, so maybe

983
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:02,381
about 50 to 60 feet from the full tunnel.

984
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:05,093
ORION: Before where the drop is, and that's where
that bottom tunnel is down there?

985
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:05,870
MATT: Yep.

986
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,715
ORION: Okay.

987
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:09,644
MATT: You guys go crashing at an angle.

988
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,862
TALIESIN: I'm going to brace to jump. I'm bracing to roll.

989
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,205
LAURA: Yeah, we're all like bracing.

990
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,586
MARISHA: Three-point landing!

991
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:17,660
LIAM: I'm grabbing for Pike and going like this.

992
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,644
LAURA: I have Scanlan!

993
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:19,899
MARISHA: What's Grog doing?

994
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:21,100
ORION: Where's Grog at?

995
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,051
LAURA: He's falling.

996
00:51:22,051 --> 00:51:23,273
LIAM: Grog's gone. Grog's down.

997
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:25,336
MATT: Grog is completely separate from you. He was
flying, and lost concentration of his spell.

998
00:51:25,336 --> 00:51:26,317
Grog's like a stone.

999
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:27,382
LAURA: No, Grog!

1000
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:28,591
ORION: Can I leap towards him?

1001
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:29,494
TALIESIN: Off what?

1002
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:30,596
MARISHA: And do what?

1003
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:31,317
MATT: Off of the carpet--

1004
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:32,486
ORION: Off of the carpet! Yes!

1005
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:33,557
LIAM: Do what?

1006
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:34,726
LAURA: You leap off of the carpet?

1007
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:39,670
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. With
a disadvantage, because you are jumping off of a

1008
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,885
currently flimsy flying carpet to try and catch up
to him.

1009
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:46,432
LAURA: Oh no.

1010
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:50,313
ORION: Right now, while I'm doing this, I'm going
to cast Featherfall on myself.

1011
00:51:50,313 --> 00:51:53,857
TRAVIS: Wait, before, you gotta get to me first,
because it will slow you too much.

1012
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:57,027
ORION: Oh. It would, wouldn't it? I thought it was
only when going down.

1013
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:58,326
TRAVIS: Gotta get to me first, motherfucker.

1014
00:51:58,326 --> 00:51:59,515
MATT: Go for it.

1015
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:01,039
ORION: Whoa. Okay.

1016
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:03,548
MATT: So what's your acrobatics check? The lower
of the two.

1017
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:04,829
LIAM: You fall a lot.

1018
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:06,342
TRAVIS: Yeah. Big things go down.

1019
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:08,215
ORION: 15 and 13.

1020
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:15,133
MATT: Okay. You manage to fumble out of the
carpet, however, you are now just end-over-end

1021
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,507
falling now off of the side of the carpet on your
own.

1022
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:18,323
LIAM: This is tense.

1023
00:52:18,323 --> 00:52:18,968
LAURA: This is tense.

1024
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:20,852
MATT: You're having a hard time even seeing Grog
now.

1025
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,350
The world's just spinning and spinning and
spinning.

1026
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,142
LAURA: Oh God.

1027
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:23,923
TRAVIS: It's like Gravity.

1028
00:52:23,923 --> 00:52:24,950
MATT: You can attempt--

1029
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,885
ORION: Now I'm going to cast Featherfall.

1030
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:32,255
MATT: Go ahead, cast and roll concentration
check. What did you roll?

1031
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:35,781
MARISHA: He rolled a 19. Which is good.

1032
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:40,718
MATT: Okay. Featherfall gets to you just in time.
Your descent slows.

1033
00:52:40,718 --> 00:52:43,336
In that time, Grog has impacted.

1034
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:44,205
MARISHA: Fuck!

1035
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:45,275
LAURA: Oh no, Grog!

1036
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:46,316
LIAM: We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit. I'm
shielding the healer.

1037
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:48,073
LAURA: I'm shielding Scanlan.

1038
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:53,475
MATT: So you all brace for impact. The actual
carpet's careening out of control. You can see

1039
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:57,790
there's just barely the top of a building you
might be able to try and skim.

1040
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,997
LAURA: Can we jump onto the top of the building?

1041
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:02,510
MATT: This is going to be up to the one who's been
steering this whole time.

1042
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,278
Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

1043
00:53:05,278 --> 00:53:06,135
LAURA: Intelligence!

1044
00:53:06,135 --> 00:53:06,884
LIAM: Intelligence?

1045
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:07,530
MATT: Yes.

1046
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,577
ASHLEY: Can I assist?

1047
00:53:08,577 --> 00:53:09,830
MATT: No.

1048
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:11,245
TRAVIS: Thank God it's not me.

1049
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:12,298
MARISHA: Can we do nothing and--

1050
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:14,333
LIAM: Good, good, good, good. 24.

1051
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,060
MATT: 24?

1052
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,082
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm pretty smart.

1053
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:19,613
MATT: You just managed to skim the edge, which
lessens your impact slightly, however, it does

1054
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,319
send you all into a full end-over-end topple.

1055
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,706
LIAM: Still holding a gnome!

1056
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:26,898
MATT: Everyone. <i>Everyone.</i> Make an acrobatics
check.

1057
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:29,390
LAURA: Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to
roll.

1058
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,183
MARISHA: Oh, no. What's going on with Grog?

1059
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:32,570
LIAM: I guess that's what we'll find out
afterwards.

1060
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,084
MATT: Grog's impacted. He was falling faster than
you guys were, he's six hundred pounds going into

1061
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:39,068
straight freefall. You guys had a little bit of a
fall break.

1062
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:42,115
MARISHA: Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing!

1063
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:45,384
ORION: Do I have to do one also?

1064
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:47,495
MATT: Everyone. Oh, except for you, because you're
floating.

1065
00:53:47,495 --> 00:53:51,703
LIAM: Do the halflings-- Shit! Do the gnomes get
an advantage

1066
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:55,246
since the half-elves are protecting them?

1067
00:53:55,246 --> 00:53:56,530
LAURA: Depending on how we roll?

1068
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,230
MATT: It's based on how you guys roll, because
you're the ones who are holding onto them.

1069
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,682
LIAM: Oh, okay.

1070
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:03,344
LAURA: Welp, Scanlan. I'm sorry to let you know--

1071
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:04,070
TALIESIN: No.

1072
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,195
LIAM: Oh no!

1073
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:06,362
MATT: So you got Pike?

1074
00:54:06,362 --> 00:54:07,236
LIAM: Yeah, I got Pike.

1075
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:08,511
MATT: What'd you roll?

1076
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,783
LIAM: 18.

1077
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:12,554
MATT: Natural one.

1078
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:13,570
ASHLEY: 13.

1079
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,468
TRAVIS: 18.

1080
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:15,964
TALIESIN: 23.

1081
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:17,593
MARISHA: Four.

1082
00:54:17,593 --> 00:54:19,639
MATT: Okay, so half-damage for you.

1083
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:22,292
LAURA: But I have a plus nine acrobatics! Plus
nine acrobatics!

1084
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,061
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

1085
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:24,641
LAURA: Doesn't matter on a natural crit fail.

1086
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:25,829
TALIESIN: Still gonna knock me out.

1087
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,138
MATT: Roll some fall damage here.

1088
00:54:28,138 --> 00:54:29,583
LAURA: I'm sorry, Scanlan!

1089
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,326
LIAM: It's all right, I got the healer, I got the
healer.

1090
00:54:31,326 --> 00:54:32,353
MARISHA: It's not gonna be good.

1091
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,610
TRAVIS: You're gonna be like an ACME cartoon and
just leave a (pff)

1092
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,478
LAURA and LIAM: (pff)

1093
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:35,321
MATT: 18 points of damage.

1094
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:36,058
TALIESIN: I'm out.

1095
00:54:36,058 --> 00:54:36,728
MARISHA: You're out again?

1096
00:54:36,728 --> 00:54:37,865
LAURA: You're unconscious again?

1097
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:38,472
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1098
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:40,541
MATT: He didn't have a lot of hit points left.

1099
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,324
LAURA: Oh no, we're all dead!

1100
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:42,532
MARISHA: This the second time Grog's almost fallen
to his death.

1101
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:44,902
MATT: 18 points of damage to you. The rest of you
all take 36 points of fall damage,

1102
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:46,026
except for Grog.

1103
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:46,983
LIAM: Everybody, everybody?

1104
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,719
LAURA: Everybody? As a group, like we all failed
as a group?

1105
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,096
MATT: Well, no, no, sorry. You succeeded, you rolled a--

1106
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:53,278
LIAM: 18.

1107
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:58,906
MATT: 18, so you would also take half-damage, so 
you would take 18 as well.

1108
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,014
ASHLEY: I take--

1109
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,848
MATT: You take half that as well, thanks to his
roll as well.

1110
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:03,286
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

1111
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,021
ASHLEY: Everybody in this club getting hit
points.

1112
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:06,493
MATT: Right, you were in full plummet, you can
reduce the damage slightly.

1113
00:55:06,493 --> 00:55:08,110
TRAVIS: Well, I was very graceful on the way
down.

1114
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,747
MATT: Yeah, you take 45 points of damage from the
impact, Grog.

1115
00:55:10,747 --> 00:55:11,556
MARISHA: 45?

1116
00:55:11,556 --> 00:55:12,548
MATT: 45 points of damage.

1117
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:13,852
MARISHA: Oh.

1118
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,946
LIAM: It was halved, so eight.

1119
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:16,050
MATT: And leave a small crater from the impact.

1120
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,724
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1121
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:17,883
MARISHA: You know what, that could've been worse.

1122
00:55:17,883 --> 00:55:19,003
LAURA: And I take 35?

1123
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:20,794
MATT: You and Scanlan both take 36, which puts
Scanlan into a negative as well, because he

1124
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:22,334
wasn't-- he was not at--

1125
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:23,736
LAURA: No, no! He was fully healed.

1126
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:24,337
TRAVIS: Nope.

1127
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:25,202
MATT: No, he wasn't.

1128
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:26,409
LAURA: (Softly) Fuck.

1129
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:27,729
LIAM: No, sorry, no.

1130
00:55:27,729 --> 00:55:30,362
MATT: So, you all tumble end over end, come to
rest.

1131
00:55:30,362 --> 00:55:32,257
MARISHA: We just crash-landed in a war camp.

1132
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:33,830
MATT: Yeah. On the far end of it, thankfully.

1133
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,230
MARISHA: Oh boy.

1134
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,114
MATT: You guys can hear the bells and the horns
going in the distance. It looks like all the rest

1135
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:41,992
of the folks that were stationed here moved
towards the center. You managed to arc over them,

1136
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:43,898
but they're going to be here shortly.

1137
00:55:43,898 --> 00:55:45,549
TRAVIS: Are we near their big war machines?

1138
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:48,372
MATT: No, the ballistae are on the opposite--

1139
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:52,327
ORION: So we can see the ledge and that cavern
where we were, where we found the--

1140
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:55,158
MATT: Well, the ledge is back in the other
direction. You guys are going towards the tunnel

1141
00:55:55,158 --> 00:55:56,849
on the opposite side.

1142
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:00,627
LIAM: Vax is pulling up Pike onto her feet and
dragging her towards Scanlan, 'cause I know how

1143
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:02,664
fucked up he was from the last battle.

1144
00:56:02,664 --> 00:56:04,119
ASHLEY: Where's Scanlan? How close--

1145
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,170
MATT: Okay, you guys-- and you, you're kinda
getting up on your knees, coughing--

1146
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,267
MARISHA: How, how--

1147
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:08,525
ASHLEY: Percy's out, let's go--

1148
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:09,626
LIAM: But so is Scanlan.

1149
00:56:09,626 --> 00:56:11,027
MATT: Percy's just face-down in the ground,
scrapes across the side of his face.

1150
00:56:11,027 --> 00:56:11,930
ASHLEY: Scanlan's out, too? Fuck.

1151
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,904
LIAM: Scanlan's out, too, right?

1152
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:14,106
MATT: Scanlan's also out.

1153
00:56:14,106 --> 00:56:15,345
TRAVIS: How about-- I'll give him a level three
potion and you go heal Scanlan.

1154
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:16,623
LAURA: No, you, here, you take care of him, I'm
right next to Scanlan,

1155
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:21,175
MATT: You guys are roughly about ten feet from
each other from the impact, just, you were

1156
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:23,553
scattered, and then you kind of regrouped.

1157
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:25,734
MARISHA: Okay. Can we see people running towards
us?

1158
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:27,810
MATT: Not yet, but you assume it's only a short
period of time.

1159
00:56:27,894 --> 00:56:29,307
ORION: Yeah, yeah, we have some time left--

1160
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,465
MARISHA: We don't, I don't know.

1161
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:34,421
MATT: Grog, what you at?

1162
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,014
TRAVIS: 39.

1163
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:36,801
MATT: Okay.

1164
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:37,685
TRAVIS: She's doing a Mass Healing--

1165
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,589
ASHLEY: A Mass Healing Word.

1166
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:41,262
MATT: Okay. You barely get yourself out of the
crater. That's gonna suck tomorrow!

1167
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:42,031
MARISHA: Mass Healing Word?

1168
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,181
LIAM: You take Scanlan, I'll take Percy.

1169
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:43,922
LAURA: Okay! I'm gonna--

1170
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:44,841
LIAM: Healing potions out.

1171
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:48,424
MATT: As this is happening, Percy, go ahead and
make a death saving throw.

1172
00:56:48,424 --> 00:56:49,378
LAURA: Oh!

1173
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:50,468
TRAVIS: A death saving throw?

1174
00:56:50,468 --> 00:56:51,229
LIAM: Sorry, here's three--

1175
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:52,590
TALIESIN: Is that-- Is that just--

1176
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:53,341
MATT: What did you roll?

1177
00:56:53,341 --> 00:56:54,231
TALIESIN: A nine.

1178
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:55,857
MATT: That's a fail, so mark off one fail on your
death saving throw on your sheet.

1179
00:56:55,857 --> 00:56:56,864
LAURA: (gasps)

1180
00:56:56,864 --> 00:56:57,932
ASHLEY and LAURA: No no no no!

1181
00:56:57,932 --> 00:56:58,683
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

1182
00:56:58,683 --> 00:56:59,678
LIAM: Sorry I'm late, Percy.

1183
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:00,614
MATT: Scanlan does make his.

1184
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:01,568
LIAM: He's all right, he's all right, he's all
right.

1185
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:03,313
I've got a healing potion and I'm pouring it--

1186
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:04,196
ASHLEY: But I'm doing--

1187
00:57:04,196 --> 00:57:06,161
LIAM: I'm pinching Percy's nose and pouring it in
his mouth.

1188
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:08,112
LAURA: And I'm pouring some down Scanlan's
throat.

1189
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:12,626
MATT: Okay, all right. So both you guys pour
healing potions. That is-- those are the normal

1190
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:14,400
ones? The common? The regular healing?

1191
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,213
LIAM: I think so.

1192
00:57:15,213 --> 00:57:15,843
LAURA: Yeah?

1193
00:57:15,843 --> 00:57:17,136
MATT: 2d4 + 2. Go ahead and roll that.

1194
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:18,114
LIAM: (whispers) 2d4 + 2.

1195
00:57:18,114 --> 00:57:19,509
TRAVIS: I'm taking a level two potion, myself.
Just--

1196
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:20,466
TALIESIN: 2d4 + 2?

1197
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:21,342
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1198
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:22,575
LIAM: Eight. Eight for Percy.

1199
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,837
MATT: That's four--

1200
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:26,004
TALIESIN: Oh! So I'm at plus eight now?

1201
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:26,907
MATT and LIAM: Yes.

1202
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:27,781
LIAM: You're up.

1203
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:28,537
MATT: Scanlan also comes to consciousness.

1204
00:57:28,537 --> 00:57:29,870
LAURA: 2d4? That's pathetic.

1205
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,278
MATT: That's the cheapest one you've got. 2d4 +
2.

1206
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:33,838
LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here and they
can--

1207
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:34,930
LAURA: Okay, fine.

1208
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,810
TALIESIN: She was gonna do a Mass Healing--

1209
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,019
MARISHA: Yeah, what's your Mass Healing Word?

1210
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:43,020
ORION: I'd like to know-- on the way down, I was
doing a little chant and I was expending my

1211
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:47,169
sorcery points to do Flexible Casting, so I regain
a slot spell on my third-level spells.

1212
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,521
MATT: Okay.

1213
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:53,564
LAURA: As we're getting up, can I see-- Is the
camp nearby, where the prisoners are?

1214
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:55,198
Is that anywhere near us?

1215
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:56,806
MATT: No, that's towards the center of the camp.

1216
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,635
LIAM: We gotta keep moving. I pull out another
corked potion and slap it into Percy's hand.

1217
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:01,627
MARISHA: Yeah, we gotta go.

1218
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:03,381
LIAM: And then grab him by the wrist and just
start walking.

1219
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:04,245
TALIESIN: I'm up.

1220
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:06,609
MARISHA: Here, wait. Save the potion, I cast
Healing Word on Percy.

1221
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,575
ASHLEY: Hold on, I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds.

1222
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:09,473
LAURA: Mass Cure Wounds?

1223
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:12,335
MATT: All right. So as you guys are running
towards the back, towards the main tunnel, which

1224
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:17,809
you can now see, it's roughly a 40- by 30-foot
tunnel. You go running through the buildings. You

1225
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:19,603
see a few duergar kinda poke out from the
buildings.

1226
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:21,516
LAURA: Can we stealth while we're doing this, or
are we too, like, injured?

1227
00:58:21,516 --> 00:58:22,363
ORION: No, this is--

1228
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:23,714
MATT: No, you guys are just bolting at this point.
You're not even

1229
00:58:23,714 --> 00:58:24,857
concentrating on stealth right now.

1230
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:25,733
LAURA: Bolting it, right.

1231
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:26,579
TALIESIN: This is, this is--

1232
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:28,978
MATT: Plus, with the group-- Basically, a few of
you would stealth and the rest of you would be

1233
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:30,803
left in the dust, so you're just kind of all
pushing for speed at this point.

1234
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:31,599
LAURA: Okay.

1235
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:32,110
ORION: Yeah.

1236
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:36,737
MATT: You all manage to push towards the back of
the entire war camp, into this tunnel. Hearing

1237
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:42,375
behind you the distant echoing shouts of
approximately 30-plus duergar heading in your

1238
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:49,662
direction. You hear a few other ballista bolts
hitting the wall above you of the stone.

1239
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:50,999
ORION: Are we all in the tunnel?

1240
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:52,520
MATT: You guys have now pushed into the tunnel.

1241
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,178
ORION: I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all
my Grand Columns.

1242
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:57,656
MATT: Okay, how many can you--

1243
00:58:57,656 --> 00:58:58,452
ORION: Three.

1244
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,962
MATT: Three per spell? And how many spell levels
do you have currently?

1245
00:59:00,962 --> 00:59:03,664
ORION: That's it, that's what I did the SP for, so
that I could cast this right now.

1246
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:04,783
MATT: Right. So you have one.

1247
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:05,923
ORION: I have none in my column.

1248
00:59:05,923 --> 00:59:08,113
MATT: Right. How many spell castings did you have
left? Two?

1249
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:09,336
ORION: No, I had one.

1250
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:10,328
ASHLEY: (whispers) 24.

1251
00:59:10,328 --> 00:59:11,030
TALIESIN: 24?

1252
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:11,806
LAURA: 24 mass?

1253
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:12,862
ASHLEY: 24 mass cure.

1254
00:59:12,862 --> 00:59:13,955
MATT: One left. So you get three columns. It's 30
feet wide.

1255
00:59:13,955 --> 00:59:15,484
LAURA: Oh, she just healed everybody for 24
points.

1256
00:59:15,484 --> 00:59:16,122
ORION: (whispers) Oh, it's 30--

1257
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:17,002
MARISHA: Oh, dope.

1258
00:59:17,002 --> 00:59:18,165
MATT: Okay, everyone heals for 24 points. Add that
up.

1259
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:18,999
LIAM: Oh, I feel good!

1260
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,036
LAURA: I feel pretty good now.

1261
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:20,990
TRAVIS: Dude! Kick that shit.

1262
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,920
LAURA: What what!

1263
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,899
ORION: It's not enough, is it?

1264
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:23,676
MATT: No.

1265
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:24,571
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Including myself?

1266
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:25,384
LIAM and TRAVIS: Yes.

1267
00:59:25,384 --> 00:59:26,999
ORION: Are the caves stone? Like the cave--

1268
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:28,004
MATT: The walls are stone.

1269
00:59:28,004 --> 00:59:28,651
TRAVIS: Ugh, that's huge.

1270
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:29,835
LAURA: Oh my god, it's major.

1271
00:59:29,835 --> 00:59:31,839
ORION: Can I like, do it from the side? Can I
attempt to?

1272
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,652
MATT: Pillars go straight up, unfortunately. It's
the nature of the spell's creation.

1273
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:35,341
MARISHA: Well wait, I can do what you're trying to
do.

1274
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:36,143
ORION: Oh! Oh yeah!

1275
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:37,143
MARISHA: I do Wall Of Stone.

1276
00:59:37,143 --> 00:59:38,029
ORION: There you go!

1277
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:40,115
MATT: Okay! So as you're trying to figure this
out, Keyleth steps over--

1278
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:41,650
MARISHA: I'm like, oh, is this, oh--

1279
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,578
ORION: It's-- Oh!

1280
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:47,124
MARISHA: Sorry! You should've just-- I would've--
they're not very--

1281
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:48,139
ORION: They're columns.

1282
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:49,022
MARISHA: Yeah.

1283
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:50,449
ORION: You're good. The wall's good.

1284
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:51,281
MARISHA: Right.

1285
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:51,993
ORION: Good.

1286
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:53,591
LAURA: Are we running? I don't know what you guys
are doing. What's happening right now?

1287
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:56,779
MATT: As you guys are doing this and rushing in,
you're realizing there's one member of your party

1288
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:59,718
that you haven't had a lot of time with--

1289
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:00,544
LAURA and LIAM: Clarota!

1290
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:01,693
MATT: -- that you didn't think about until this
moment.

1291
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:02,761
LIAM: Clarota, yeah. Clarota.

1292
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:03,759
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

1293
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:09,362
MATT: You now see, kind of, like, floating, via
levitation ability, about 30 feet away, slowly

1294
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:12,073
descending towards you, as you're putting up the
wall of stone--

1295
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:13,051
ORION: Oh! Wait! Hold on!

1296
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:15,145
TRAVIS: Come on Squidworth, over here!

1297
01:00:15,222 --> 01:00:21,917
MATT: Two bolts go firing towards him; one
whooshes overhead, a second one--

1298
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:22,839
MARISHA: Clarota!

1299
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:25,518
MATT: (impact sound) -- through his back, out the
front of his chest--

1300
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:26,358
LAURA: No!

1301
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:27,547
MATT: -- off the shoulder.

1302
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:30,283
ORION: Come on! We need to save him!

1303
01:00:30,283 --> 01:00:31,861
LIAM: He's gotta have more than ten hit points.

1304
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:33,162
ORION: Recess the wall, recess the wall!

1305
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:33,992
MARISHA: Wait!

1306
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:39,309
MATT: You can see now-- and the bolt itself is
about 4 feet long, made of this long, jagged,

1307
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:40,798
pointed arrow tip.

1308
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:41,728
LAURA: Oh, man.

1309
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:44,862
MATT: Clarota begins to falter, and begins to
hover towards you, almost, like, trying to swim

1310
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:46,334
through the air in your direction.

1311
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:47,308
LAURA: Can we run out, try to grab him?

1312
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:48,290
ASHLEY: Can I grab him, hang on to him?

1313
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,273
ORION: Oh!

1314
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:51,994
MATT: He's about 20 feet from you now, you can try
and reach out and put your hands towards him--

1315
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:52,612
ORION: Boom!

1316
01:00:52,612 --> 01:00:53,460
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1317
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,258
TRAVIS: I take off and run to him.

1318
01:00:54,258 --> 01:00:58,804
ORION: Now I cast Glacial Blast, right under him,
like a slide, right towards us-- and catch him.

1319
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:01,222
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are running towards
him, instead,

1320
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,199
this giant crystalline form of ice just--

1321
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,473
LAURA: Oh, all right.

1322
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:07,379
MATT: -- crackles up into what looks like some
sort of strange, winter festival slide that would

1323
01:01:07,379 --> 01:01:09,724
be made for children in the center of town.
Clarota--

1324
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:10,721
ASHLEY: Awesome.

1325
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:16,661
MATT: -- as it descends, two more bolts come
towards him. Both (whoosh, whoosh). At this

1326
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:19,624
distance, in the darkness of the cavern, it's kind
of hard for them to get a bead on him. Both just

1327
01:01:19,624 --> 01:01:25,018
pass overhead. With eyes kind of lolling, Clarota
comes down and hits the edge of the slide, and

1328
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:28,518
almost loses consciousness at that moment, sliding
through the ice. You guys manage to capture,

1329
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,815
grappling his arms, lift him to his feet--

1330
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:34,317
MARISHA: And now, Wall Of Stone.

1331
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:37,178
MATT: You all make it into the tunnel, Keyleth
turns around, raising her hands, the actual

1332
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:42,723
blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a
second, and then a giant, thick wall of natural

1333
01:01:42,723 --> 01:01:45,336
rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you.

1334
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:46,772
ORION: Nice.

1335
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:47,940
LAURA: I love you, Trinket!

1336
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,021
LIAM: Completely seals it?

1337
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:49,972
MARISHA: Oh, gosh.

1338
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,030
MATT: Completely seals it. You guys are now in
complete darkness.

1339
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,076
ORION: Ooh! Light!

1340
01:01:54,076 --> 01:02:00,529
MATT: As the light hits, you can hear, just on the
other side of the surface of the stone wall,

1341
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:04,691
javelins, other things are being shot at the stone
wall--

1342
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,407
LAURA: Yeah!

1343
01:02:05,407 --> 01:02:09,075
MATT: -- but it's keeping it at bay. You guys are
now at the wall, and behind you the tunnel

1344
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:11,326
continues into a passage you haven't seen yet.

1345
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:14,744
TRAVIS: Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust
of tracelessness behind us

1346
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:17,177
the whole time like a fucking flower girl.

1347
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:19,296
(all laugh)

1348
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:23,025
LIAM: They could have magic in their possession,
they could use magic as well, so let's move.

1349
01:02:23,025 --> 01:02:23,890
LAURA: Yeah, they could get through it.

1350
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:24,650
ORION: Yes.

1351
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:25,448
TALIESIN: Will a healing potion work on Clarota?

1352
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:26,522
ASHLEY: So, Clarota's with us?

1353
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:27,164
LAURA: Clarota's with us.

1354
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,514
ASHLEY: Can I go over to Clarota and try to heal
him?

1355
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:30,958
LAURA: Don't get too close, he might just suck in
your brain.

1356
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:31,774
MATT: You can certainly try.

1357
01:02:31,774 --> 01:02:32,644
TALIESIN: I've got a potion, so--

1358
01:02:32,644 --> 01:02:33,337
MARISHA: Grog?

1359
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:34,224
ASHLEY: Should we give him a potion?

1360
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:34,946
TRAVIS: What?

1361
01:02:34,946 --> 01:02:36,524
MARISHA: Do you have any ale?

1362
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:39,558
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.

1363
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:40,809
MARISHA: I think I need a drink.

1364
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,529
TRAVIS: Right. I'll--

1365
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,543
TALIESIN: What's a level two potion do?

1366
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,191
TRAVIS: There you are.

1367
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:48,202
MATT: A level two potion would be 4d4 + 4.

1368
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,623
TRAVIS: I go and hold his shoulders--

1369
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:50,542
MARISHA: I really need a drink.

1370
01:02:50,542 --> 01:02:53,701
TRAVIS: -- whilst she tries to heal him, just in
case he gets all sucky on her.

1371
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:55,390
ASHLEY: I think he's gonna give him a potion.

1372
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,033
TRAVIS: Oh.

1373
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:56,732
TALIESIN: I am.

1374
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:57,593
TRAVIS: That's much less--

1375
01:02:57,593 --> 01:02:58,505
LAURA: No!

1376
01:02:58,505 --> 01:03:00,392
LIAM: Felicia Day, that's not nice!

1377
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:02,604
TRAVIS: Hey!

1378
01:03:02,604 --> 01:03:03,991
TALIESIN: 17 points of healing.

1379
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:05,724
MATT: Okay. 17 points to Clarota.

1380
01:03:05,724 --> 01:03:07,548
ASHLEY: What'd she say?

1381
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:11,031
MATT: Which-- administering a potion to a mind
flayer is an experience that very few in this

1382
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:15,798
world have probably ever, or ever will,
experience. As you kind of reach over, grab his

1383
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:19,310
shoulder, you look for where to put it, and the
tendrils kind of, like, flail about, but begin

1384
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:24,313
to-- they, as he notices what you're doing, kind
of relax and open up, and you can now see the

1385
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:29,218
circular, lamprey-like, toothy maw of the mind
flayer. It's a very disturbing, disgusting image,

1386
01:03:29,218 --> 01:03:37,146
with this jagged, yellow teeth, in a circular
form. You pop the cork, and just pour it in. As

1387
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:41,390
you do, you see the wounds across Clarota's form
begin to seal.

1388
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:45,385
The arrow is still stuck in its torso.

1389
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:46,621
LAURA: Can we try to pull it out?

1390
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:47,849
ASHLEY: Try to break off the part--

1391
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:48,646
MATT: You can certainly try.

1392
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:50,285
TRAVIS: I got it (snap)!

1393
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,774
MATT: Go ahead and make a-- this would be a
medicine check.

1394
01:03:53,774 --> 01:03:55,251
LAURA: Do you wanna do that, Grog?

1395
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:57,348
TRAVIS: I'll do the breaking part.

1396
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:59,029
MATT: It's iron. It's solid iron.

1397
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,882
ASHLEY: My medicine's a four.

1398
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:00,821
LAURA: Oh.

1399
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:01,643
MATT: Breaking it off is not gonna work.

1400
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:02,834
ASHLEY: What's your medicine?

1401
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:03,728
TRAVIS: So? Zero.

1402
01:04:03,728 --> 01:04:05,401
MATT: You have to pull it from the wound.

1403
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:05,849
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll try.

1404
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:06,797
TALIESIN: Who has a medicine?

1405
01:04:06,797 --> 01:04:07,229
LAURA: So what are you--

1406
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:08,039
ASHLEY: A four.

1407
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,187
LAURA: Okay. All right.

1408
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:09,695
ASHLEY: What does everybody have?

1409
01:04:09,695 --> 01:04:10,261
MATT: Go for it.

1410
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:10,727
LAURA: Do it!

1411
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:11,392
ASHLEY: Roll this guy? Okay. Nine?

1412
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:12,527
MATT: A nine.

1413
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:13,205
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no.

1414
01:04:13,205 --> 01:04:13,885
ASHLEY: Sorry!

1415
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:16,530
MATT: So. You take your moment, you view up where
the puncture wound is, with a little bit of Grog's

1416
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:23,620
help, you both grab the edge, and you're like, 'On
three. One, two, three, pull!' You pull through

1417
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,340
the wound, not against the arrow--

1418
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,069
TRAVIS: Right.

1419
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:29,161
MATT: -- 'cause that would just tear everything
out in the process, but nevertheless, in doing so,

1420
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:31,822
Clarota does take an additional eight points of
damage.

1421
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:32,838
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

1422
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:35,255
MATT: But, the wound is now no longer a giant--

1423
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:36,195
LAURA: Able to be healed.

1424
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:40,378
MATT: -- it's now able to be healed completely,
so. Clarota takes a moment

1425
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:42,794
and kind of grasps the wound.

1426
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:48,489
LAURA: I hand him a little healing potion, and
say, sorry.

1427
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:53,581
MATT: Shatters the glass. At which point, you now
hear (impact sounds) against the stone wall.

1428
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:54,313
LAURA: We should move!

1429
01:04:54,313 --> 01:04:55,094
ASHLEY: Time to go!

1430
01:04:55,094 --> 01:04:56,581
LIAM: Let's keep moving, yes? Yes.

1431
01:04:56,581 --> 01:05:01,891
TRAVIS: I pick up Clarota. Yeah, why not.

1432
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:02,736
LAURA: Yeah, all right.

1433
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,856
TRAVIS: I pick up Clarota and we start running
balls.

1434
01:05:04,856 --> 01:05:06,453
LAURA: Is he good enough to walk or is he--

1435
01:05:06,453 --> 01:05:08,242
MATT: He's good enough to walk with you guys.
Well--

1436
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:11,797
TRAVIS: Well, how about I put one arm under his
face and help him.

1437
01:05:11,797 --> 01:05:13,820
MATT: So you're helping him.

1438
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:18,022
LIAM: No, that's-- hold on a second. I take out
the flying carpet--

1439
01:05:18,022 --> 01:05:19,099
LAURA: We still have the flying carpet?

1440
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:19,773
LIAM: Sure we do!

1441
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:20,357
MATT: Yeah.

1442
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:22,416
LIAM: Here, sit on this, Clarota.

1443
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,303
LAURA: If you need it.

1444
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:24,414
LIAM: That'd be easier, yes.

1445
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:28,892
MATT: Clarota gets up on the carpet and-- "Thank
you." The carpet kind of drifts alongside you

1446
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:34,306
guys. You guys are pushing backwards towards the
cavern. The tunnel kind of begins to pinch a

1447
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:38,307
little bit. It gets to about a 15-foot width
before it opens up again. You're about a hundred

1448
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:43,652
feet back. You can now see it opening into a--
what looks like an extension of the war camp.

1449
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:45,720
(all groan)

1450
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,988
LAURA: We should've gone down! What were we
thinking?

1451
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:50,658
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

1452
01:05:50,658 --> 01:05:51,914
LIAM: That guy was lying.

1453
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,237
LAURA: Well, he said go down. We didn't go down.

1454
01:05:54,315 --> 01:05:57,760
LIAM: 21 for me.

1455
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:05,856
LAURA: 13 for me. I like how my passive perception
is way higher than any rolls that I ever do.

1456
01:06:05,856 --> 01:06:07,953
MATT: I do keep that-- I keep tabs on that.

1457
01:06:07,953 --> 01:06:09,083
TALIESIN: 22.

1458
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,205
MARISHA: Are we all doing perception rolls?

1459
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:13,362
MATT: For the most part, we've got a few rolls,
and it worked fine. Looking inside though, this

1460
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:15,639
camp looks like it's been abandoned.

1461
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,505
LAURA: Oh, good!

1462
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,535
MATT: It looks like it was built, and then the
expansion into the war camp you just escaped from

1463
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:23,839
seemed to be the next step. Like it's slowly
advancing and this section of it has been in

1464
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:29,529
disuse. As you push in towards the center of the
camp you can see there's older campfires, lots of

1465
01:06:29,529 --> 01:06:33,984
the tents have like partially collapsed. Dust has
gathered.

1466
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:38,179
LIAM: I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit.

1467
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:43,384
MATT: Okay. Looking around as well, you see all
the equipment. Any pieces that would be of

1468
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:48,168
interest have either been taken-- either destroyed
and are broken or have probably been moved into

1469
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:54,015
the war camp. You glance through a couple of the
tents. Looking about, it's definitely been

1470
01:06:54,015 --> 01:06:59,905
abandoned. It no longer serves a purpose and
anything of use has been stripped and taken. This

1471
01:06:59,905 --> 01:07:05,174
cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so. It's a
little domed section, and you can now see there

1472
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:09,756
are two exit tunnels to this section. One that is
kind of straight ahead, a little bit to the left.

1473
01:07:09,756 --> 01:07:13,863
And one that veers off to the direct left of you.
So if you're looking straight from the direction

1474
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,394
you came, there is one right ahead of you, a
little bit to the left

1475
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:18,278
and one that goes quickly to the left.

1476
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:19,597
LAURA: Should we take the left one?

1477
01:07:19,597 --> 01:07:20,809
TRAVIS: Which one's the left one?

1478
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:21,721
MARISHA: He mentioned the left.

1479
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:23,279
LAURA: Yeah, so maybe we should stay left.

1480
01:07:23,279 --> 01:07:24,056
MATT: Yeah, do that.

1481
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:27,035
LIAM: Clarota, do you know anything about these
passages?

1482
01:07:27,035 --> 01:07:28,010
LAURA: Do you remember anything?

1483
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,116
MARISHA: Wait, why did he say that? Why did you
say that?

1484
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:36,767
MATT: 'Cause they're both kind of left. It's a
joke. Clarota takes a moment and kind of looks at

1485
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:45,219
you, kind of-- his breath. "I've not been this far
up these tunnels. It's too dangerous this close to

1486
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:49,789
"the war camp. I would've been killed in a
second."

1487
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:53,237
LAURA: What about the general's memory? Anything
there?

1488
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:59,840
MATT: He kind of closes his eyes for a second.
"One of these leads below, one of them leads to

1489
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,156
"the surface. I can't recall which."

1490
01:08:04,156 --> 01:08:06,432
LAURA: Can we go up and--

1491
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:07,493
TRAVIS: Let's split up!

1492
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:10,425
LAURA: No, can we go next to the one on the far
left and see if I sense

1493
01:08:10,425 --> 01:08:13,153
any like wind coming down, is there--

1494
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:17,198
MATT: Going to the one on the far left, as you're
stepping you hear a (muffled impact noise)--

1495
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,367
LAURA: Oh, well, good.

1496
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:20,535
MATT: -- against the distant stone wall that you
put up.

1497
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:22,019
TRAVIS: I think we get to pick one here.

1498
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:23,202
MARISHA: Are there any--

1499
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:24,802
ASHLEY: He did say go left.

1500
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:26,787
MATT: As you head to the tunnel, you don't sense
any sort of temperature change, but it does seem

1501
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:29,918
to steady off into a decline that curves to the
left.

1502
01:08:29,918 --> 01:08:30,766
LAURA: We should do that.

1503
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:31,552
TALIESIN: Sounds good.

1504
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:34,493
MARISHA: Do you mean, are there like-- is there
any wildlife, any bats,

1505
01:08:34,493 --> 01:08:37,726
any type of animals, anything like that?

1506
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:42,549
MATT: We shall say, a general sense of this area,
you look and you can see, in this area, unlike the

1507
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:46,273
previous sections, there are small clusters of
bats on the ceiling.

1508
01:08:46,273 --> 01:08:47,112
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to--

1509
01:08:47,112 --> 01:08:50,077
MATT: As apparently they have an exit of some kind
to the surface.

1510
01:08:50,077 --> 01:08:52,763
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast
Sense on one of the bats.

1511
01:08:52,763 --> 01:08:55,702
MATT: Okay.

1512
01:08:55,702 --> 01:08:58,867
MARISHA: And I'm going to channel myself through
the bat and I'm going to

1513
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:03,715
make him fly down the far left tunnel.

1514
01:09:03,715 --> 01:09:06,959
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are walking over there,
one of the bats--

1515
01:09:06,959 --> 01:09:09,724
ASHLEY: Good call.

1516
01:09:09,724 --> 01:09:15,516
MATT: -- heads down into the tunnel, continues
into the darkness.

1517
01:09:15,516 --> 01:09:16,466
MARISHA: Can I just see--

1518
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,965
MATT: From the echolocation, which is a very
strange sensation, you haven't really done this

1519
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:22,722
before for a bat and it's a very weird experience.

1520
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:25,325
MARISHA: Wow, guys, this is really trippy.

1521
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,077
TALIESIN: We just hear (bat sounds).

1522
01:09:27,077 --> 01:09:31,089
MATT: It continues about a steady 40-degree
decline that goes further and further down.

1523
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,728
LAURA: Keep going down. Down, down, down.

1524
01:09:32,728 --> 01:09:37,905
MATT: Eventually, you get to a point where the bat
is out of your sphere of influence and you lose

1525
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:40,395
your connection to the bat.

1526
01:09:40,395 --> 01:09:41,654
LAURA: Keep going down?

1527
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:48,495
MARISHA: Well, I didn't really see much, but
definitely there is a pretty steep incline. We

1528
01:09:48,495 --> 01:09:50,091
could try it again and go down the other one.

1529
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,100
LIAM: This is a coin flip.

1530
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,575
LAURA: I think we keep going down. Just stick with
it.

1531
01:09:52,575 --> 01:09:54,252
ORION: Hold on! Incline means up.

1532
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:55,151
LAURA: Oh.

1533
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:56,012
MATT: No, it's a decline.

1534
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:56,781
MARISHA: Decline.

1535
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:57,999
ORION: Decline means down.

1536
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:00,319
LAURA: Well, then let's go with the decline. Yes?

1537
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:01,857
TALIESIN: Yes.

1538
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:03,028
LAURA: Let's do it!

1539
01:10:03,028 --> 01:10:05,108
TALIESIN: We go. With haste.

1540
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:05,928
LAURA: Yes.

1541
01:10:05,928 --> 01:10:06,594
MATT: All righty.

1542
01:10:06,594 --> 01:10:07,424
TRAVIS: With haste!

1543
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:09,273
LAURA: With stealth! With Dust of Tracelessness
behind us.

1544
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,522
TRAVIS: Hey, flower girl!

1545
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,060
LAURA: Flower girl!

1546
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,483
ORION: Actually, there's two tunnels, right?

1547
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:18,892
MATT: There are two tunnels, yes.

1548
01:10:18,892 --> 01:10:20,182
ORION: And one's smaller than the other?

1549
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,604
MATT: Correct.

1550
01:10:22,604 --> 01:10:24,563
ORION: Hm.

1551
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:25,524
MATT: Yes?

1552
01:10:25,524 --> 01:10:26,819
TALIESIN: There's no right answer here. It's
just--

1553
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:28,472
ORION: I know.

1554
01:10:28,472 --> 01:10:29,607
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1555
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:32,819
ORION: How big is the-- how wide is the smaller
one that we're going through?

1556
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:38,137
MATT: There's one, the one on the far end, the one
that does not appear to be a decline,

1557
01:10:38,137 --> 01:10:43,191
seems to be the widest of the two.

1558
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:46,396
TRAVIS: I pull out a torch. Will you light my
torch?

1559
01:10:46,396 --> 01:10:48,865
ORION: Yeah.

1560
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:50,093
TRAVIS: Nice.

1561
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:51,946
(all laugh)

1562
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:53,395
TRAVIS: Are we going to the left?

1563
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:53,915
LAURA: Yeah.

1564
01:10:53,915 --> 01:10:55,245
TRAVIS: I take off running to the left.

1565
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:56,112
LAURA: Oh, god. Grog!

1566
01:10:56,112 --> 01:10:56,784
MATT: Okay.

1567
01:10:56,784 --> 01:10:57,383
LIAM: Running, running?

1568
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:58,003
TRAVIS: Running!

1569
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:58,597
LIAM: Really running?

1570
01:10:58,597 --> 01:10:59,402
TRAVIS: Running to the left.

1571
01:10:59,402 --> 01:11:00,425
ORION: Oh man, oh no!

1572
01:11:00,425 --> 01:11:01,249
MATT: Grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel
to the very left--

1573
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:02,085
LAURA: Grog! Stop!

1574
01:11:02,085 --> 01:11:03,473
ORION: Let's go, everybody!

1575
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:04,333
MARISHA: There he goes!

1576
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,155
LAURA: I'm gonna take off after him.

1577
01:11:05,155 --> 01:11:08,567
MATT: The heavy footsteps of Grog disappearing
into the darkness--

1578
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:09,667
TRAVIS: (maniacal laugh)

1579
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,038
LAURA: We take off after him, 'cause he needs
help.

1580
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:11,899
ORION: Let's go!

1581
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:15,343
MARISHA: Grog, Grog! Don't run too far ahead--
He's gone.

1582
01:11:15,343 --> 01:11:16,351
MATT: You guys give chase.

1583
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:17,033
LAURA: Yes.

1584
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:17,887
LIAM: It's like having Goofy as a party member.

1585
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:18,926
(all laugh)

1586
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:20,249
LIAM: (Goofy laugh)

1587
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:21,160
ASHLEY: Hodor!

1588
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,211
TRAVIS: Hah. Hodor.

1589
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,041
ASHLEY: Hodor.

1590
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,457
MATT: As you guys catch up to Grog, which isn't
too hard--

1591
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:26,445
TRAVIS: What? I'm fast.

1592
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:27,444
MATT: Are you going to a full sprint, though?

1593
01:11:27,444 --> 01:11:30,279
TRAVIS: No, no, no. I mean. A leisurely jog.

1594
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:36,416
MATT: Right. You catch up to Grog. The tunnel
itself is about 30 feet wide, 20 feet tall. And it

1595
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:41,266
is a slow, continuously gradual decline and curve
to the left.

1596
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:42,477
LAURA: Can you do another wall?

1597
01:11:42,477 --> 01:11:43,854
MATT: Like a spiral, downward.

1598
01:11:43,854 --> 01:11:44,959
LAURA: No?

1599
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:49,837
TRAVIS: Maybe we could do a cave-in.

1600
01:11:49,837 --> 01:11:51,342
LAURA: Well, that might be dangerous.

1601
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:53,385
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it'd be fun.

1602
01:11:53,385 --> 01:11:59,312
MATT: You guys continue for another 20 or so
minutes down, before it opens up into a small

1603
01:11:59,312 --> 01:12:07,830
alcove to the right, but the tunnel continues.
This alcove, it's about 35, 40 feet in, and it

1604
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:12,614
looks like there are remnants here of a camp that
was set up once. Similar to the war camp, but once

1605
01:12:12,614 --> 01:12:14,742
again abandoned, or at least currently not in use.

1606
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:15,638
LIAM: Any useful shit?

1607
01:12:15,638 --> 01:12:20,765
LAURA: Can we go, oh! Can we go in? We should
probably rest, heal up, get our spells back. Can

1608
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:26,049
you cast the illusion terrain and make it look
like there's no hole in the cavern here?

1609
01:12:26,049 --> 01:12:31,337
MARISHA: No. I can't, today. I'm sorry.

1610
01:12:31,337 --> 01:12:36,282
ORION: If this is where we're gonna be chilling, I
can seal off that tunnel still.

1611
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:39,537
LAURA: But we have to be able to get back out.

1612
01:12:39,537 --> 01:12:41,411
ORION: Right.

1613
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:44,552
TRAVIS: Not necessarily.

1614
01:12:44,552 --> 01:12:45,638
ASHLEY: If I--

1615
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:50,683
LIAM: No! If you seal off the passage, right, we
keep going down, and if that's a dead end-- it's

1616
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:55,706
probably not-- if it is, can't we rest and use the
same spell to open it up?

1617
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:56,762
ORION: No, it's permanent.

1618
01:12:56,762 --> 01:12:57,587
LIAM: That sucks.

1619
01:12:57,587 --> 01:12:59,360
ORION: But we would just have Grog hack away at it
for a while--

1620
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,369
TRAVIS: Thank you!

1621
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:02,325
ORION: It can be, you know, destroyed.

1622
01:13:02,325 --> 01:13:05,108
TRAVIS: They do call me 'Grog the Locksmith.'

1623
01:13:05,108 --> 01:13:05,925
ORION: Right!

1624
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:07,020
TRAVIS: They don't call me that.

1625
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,779
LAURA: Can we go in and look at the camp and see,
like, stealthily--

1626
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:09,537
MATT: Yeah!

1627
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:10,650
LAURA: -- check out what the camp is?

1628
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,916
MARISHA: I can make it really foggy.

1629
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:14,029
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigate check.

1630
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:14,816
MARISHA: I could do that.

1631
01:13:14,816 --> 01:13:15,830
LIAM: Yes, we know that about you.

1632
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,960
TRAVIS: Oh, I can too!

1633
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,184
LIAM: What about in the game, though?

1634
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:20,385
MARISHA: I can make it look like a--

1635
01:13:20,385 --> 01:13:21,374
LAURA: 20.

1636
01:13:21,374 --> 01:13:22,175
MATT: All right.

1637
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,874
MARISHA: Well, that's a different story.

1638
01:13:23,874 --> 01:13:27,968
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Vex does a quick glance over, there are about four

1639
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,415
tents that are still set up, there appears to be a
small ring where a fire was set up, and you can

1640
01:13:31,415 --> 01:13:32,566
see kind of bits of charcoal--

1641
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:33,555
TALIESIN: Yes!

1642
01:13:33,555 --> 01:13:36,672
MATT: -- and bits of long, long, long forgotten
burnt meat, remnants, charcoal, and such there.

1643
01:13:36,672 --> 01:13:37,816
TRAVIS: I have two firewood bundles.

1644
01:13:37,816 --> 01:13:40,785
TALIESIN: I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if
there's a seal anywhere around.

1645
01:13:40,785 --> 01:13:42,574
MATT: You do see, on one of the walls--

1646
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:43,315
TALIESIN: Bam!

1647
01:13:43,315 --> 01:13:45,114
MATT: -- there is a similar seal of Bahamut.

1648
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:46,760
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! This was her camp!

1649
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,641
TALIESIN: Kima was here!

1650
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:48,558
LAURA: Kima was here!

1651
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:49,745
MARISHA: #kimawashere.

1652
01:13:49,745 --> 01:13:51,065
MATT: However, there are four tents here--

1653
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:51,827
LAURA: Oh.

1654
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:52,365
ORION: Kima was here.

1655
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:55,680
MATT: Which means-- previously you saw just one,
from what you saw. There are four here.

1656
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,855
TRAVIS: She had babies.

1657
01:13:57,855 --> 01:14:00,958
MATT: It's an interesting change to your
appearance. Means either been repurposed, or there

1658
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:04,339
were more people with her, or since then the tent,
the camp has been used

1659
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:08,381
by other individuals aside from her.

1660
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:09,563
TRAVIS: Oh.

1661
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:15,647
MATT: However, glancing through, you do notice
that there are a few discarded travel bags--

1662
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:17,871
LAURA: Mine! Mine! Mine!

1663
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:19,105
MARISHA: Ooh!

1664
01:14:19,105 --> 01:14:24,460
MATT: -- carrying rope, grappling hooks, general
cluster of torches, about eight in total--

1665
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,351
LAURA: Okay, that's nice. Torch, torch, torch,
torch.

1666
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:27,995
TRAVIS: Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of
holding.

1667
01:14:27,995 --> 01:14:31,718
MATT: And as you glance about you can see, in this
alcove, looking at the dirt itself, it looks like

1668
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:34,889
there was a serious struggle. You can start seeing
drag mark--

1669
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:39,607
LAURA: Can I use Tracking and see what happened,
like Prince Humperdink, please? Can do?

1670
01:14:39,607 --> 01:14:41,822
MATT: Ah, well, this is part of your investigation
roll, essentially.

1671
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:43,245
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1672
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,959
MATT: Unless you want to track to where the tracks
went, that's a different story. That's--

1673
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:49,606
LAURA: Well, can I see who was attacked first?
Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she--

1674
01:14:49,606 --> 01:14:52,948
MATT: It's hard to tell, you see some of the
footsteps, and some of the drag marks, while

1675
01:14:52,948 --> 01:15:00,922
mostly worn over, elements do show some of the
fairer folk. The duergar have a very distinct

1676
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:08,501
footprint or size. You do see one that resembles
more of, like, gnomish or halfling origin. You see

1677
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:15,273
drag marks in the dirt, you see other individuals,
looks like there were chunks of rock that have

1678
01:15:15,273 --> 01:15:18,665
been chopped off the side of the wall that look
fresh, where you can see the soot that has settled

1679
01:15:18,665 --> 01:15:22,842
into this part of the cavern is no longer visible
where these scratch marks

1680
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:26,204
basically took off and exposed fresh rock.

1681
01:15:26,204 --> 01:15:28,892
LAURA: The drag marks, do they lead outside of the
alcove and down?

1682
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,622
MATT: They do, and they lead down the tunnel
further.

1683
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:33,279
LAURA: Okay.

1684
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,279
TRAVIS: Let's go that way, or are we resting?

1685
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:36,190
LAURA: Do we need to rest? I mean--

1686
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,282
LIAM: I think we should rest.

1687
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:38,051
ORION: I need to rest.

1688
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:40,204
LAURA: -- I feel like we need to get our spells
back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed.

1689
01:15:40,204 --> 01:15:40,788
ORION: Yes.

1690
01:15:40,788 --> 01:15:42,111
MARISHA: Are we being chased right now?

1691
01:15:42,111 --> 01:15:42,933
TALIESIN: Possibly.

1692
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:43,710
ORION: Possibly.

1693
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,082
MARISHA: Are people hot on our tail?

1694
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:45,848
ORION: Possibly.

1695
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:46,824
TALIESIN: We can rest in shifts.

1696
01:15:46,824 --> 01:15:48,091
LAURA: Yeah. I guess that's the best thing to do.

1697
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:48,852
TRAVIS: I'll stay awake.

1698
01:15:48,852 --> 01:15:51,061
LIAM: I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay
awake too.

1699
01:15:51,061 --> 01:15:53,645
ORION: Should I seal the tunnel?

1700
01:15:53,645 --> 01:15:54,636
MARISHA: I need to sleep.

1701
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:56,459
LAURA: Maybe seal the tunnel behind us, yeah, so
that--

1702
01:15:56,459 --> 01:15:57,149
LIAM: Yes.

1703
01:15:57,149 --> 01:15:58,528
LAURA: -- if they do come, they have to like, try
to get through.

1704
01:15:58,528 --> 01:16:00,118
ASHLEY: I can stay, I can stay awake too, I'm
okay.

1705
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:00,755
ORION: Cool.

1706
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:01,725
ASHLEY: So maybe everybody sleep--

1707
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:02,747
ORION: So I do.

1708
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:08,003
MATT: Okay. So you use your spell, you seal off
the tunnel with pillars. You can just barely get

1709
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:13,040
most of the entranceway covered, there's a couple
of small slivers and spaces between.

1710
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,383
ORION: But we would sure hear them, if they
were--

1711
01:16:15,383 --> 01:16:16,402
LAURA: Trying to get through, yeah.

1712
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:17,172
MATT: Yeah. If they were.

1713
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,073
LAURA: All right.

1714
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:23,206
MATT: All right. So you guys end up making camp,
are you guys lighting a fire? Or are you keeping

1715
01:16:23,206 --> 01:16:24,295
it dark? What's your plan?

1716
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:28,189
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got two firewood bundles in the
bag of Ikea holding.

1717
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,204
TALIESIN: I don't think we need a fire.

1718
01:16:29,204 --> 01:16:30,020
LIAM: I don't think it's a good idea.

1719
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,806
ASHLEY: Do we need a fire?

1720
01:16:30,806 --> 01:16:31,451
LAURA: Yeah.

1721
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:32,308
LIAM: We're fine. It's warm down here.

1722
01:16:32,308 --> 01:16:33,101
MATT: It's fairly warm.

1723
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:33,897
LIAM: Yes.

1724
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:34,444
ORION: Oh.

1725
01:16:34,444 --> 01:16:35,280
TRAVIS: Then, no?

1726
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,459
(all laugh)

1727
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:42,314
LIAM: We've got Tiberius, if he's awake, can cast
Light, let's just go into one of these tents.

1728
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:43,531
TRAVIS: I wanna burn something.

1729
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:44,278
LAURA: I know.

1730
01:16:44,278 --> 01:16:45,176
MARISHA: Yeah, two to a tent.

1731
01:16:45,176 --> 01:16:46,039
LAURA: You can keep burning a torch.

1732
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:47,926
MARISHA: We can each have our own tent! There's
enough.

1733
01:16:47,926 --> 01:16:48,957
LAURA: Stick it in the ground.

1734
01:16:48,957 --> 01:16:50,171
TRAVIS: Is there anything made of wood down here?

1735
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:53,204
ORION: I actually have to rest completely, so I
can't do shifts.

1736
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:54,378
TRAVIS: I want to set it on fire.

1737
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:55,250
MATT: Okay. Fair enough.

1738
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:56,476
ORION: I need all my spell slots.

1739
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:57,484
MARISHA: I need to sleep as well.

1740
01:16:57,484 --> 01:17:01,206
MATT: What wood there is, is used charcoal in the
abandoned fire pit, unfortunately.

1741
01:17:01,206 --> 01:17:02,844
ASHLEY: Yeah, but can you--

1742
01:17:02,844 --> 01:17:05,730
TRAVIS: I wanted to pyro shit.

1743
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,087
MATT: You guys get set up?

1744
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:11,712
LIAM: I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can
gamble while everyone are sleeping.

1745
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:12,798
TRAVIS: Ooh!

1746
01:17:12,798 --> 01:17:13,680
MATT: Fair enough.

1747
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,466
TALIESIN: How much does a rest heal? Out of
curiosity?

1748
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:17,370
MATT: A rest heals you to full.

1749
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,205
TALIESIN: Oh, excellent.

1750
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:19,361
LAURA: Oh, sweet! Yeah, let's fully rest.

1751
01:17:19,361 --> 01:17:22,496
TALIESIN: Do I have time to do a quick engineering
feat, as well?

1752
01:17:22,496 --> 01:17:24,069
MATT: You do not have--

1753
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:25,200
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Never mind.

1754
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,548
MATT: Like at this point, I mean, you could--
what're you trying to do? I should say.

1755
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:30,125
TALIESIN: Make an explosive arrow. I'm just in a
mood.

1756
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,326
MATT: Do you have any currently built explosives?

1757
01:17:32,326 --> 01:17:33,868
TALIESIN: No, but I have gunpowder.

1758
01:17:33,868 --> 01:17:37,103
MATT: You know what, I'll let you go ahead and try
it with just your tinker's kit--

1759
01:17:37,103 --> 01:17:37,809
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1760
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:38,797
LAURA: Tinker's?

1761
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:39,929
MATT: It's gonna be a difficult--

1762
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:40,709
TALIESIN: That's fine!

1763
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:42,102
MATT: -- roll, but go for it.

1764
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:44,293
TALIESIN: What do I add? Am I just straight roll?

1765
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,851
MATT: You add your proficiency bonus, which is,
the tinker's kit is four.

1766
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:50,868
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Proficiency bonus. 15?

1767
01:17:50,868 --> 01:17:59,459
MATT: 15? Okay, okay. You manage to fasten what
appears to be a black powder, impact-based

1768
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:04,041
explosive to the tip of an arrow. It's a little
weighty and unwieldy, it might not be the most

1769
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,843
accurate thing in the world, but if it hits it's
probably gonna pack a punch.

1770
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:09,216
TALIESIN: Okay. I have another gift.

1771
01:18:09,216 --> 01:18:10,095
LAURA: You do?

1772
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:11,108
TALIESIN: Explosive arrow!

1773
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:12,153
LAURA: This is the best day ever!

1774
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:13,030
TALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.

1775
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,964
LIAM: (Cary Elwes voice) Gently! Gently!

1776
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:14,799
ORION: It's a bit iffy.

1777
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:15,688
LAURA: Gently!

1778
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:16,453
MARISHA: Don't trust it!

1779
01:18:16,453 --> 01:18:17,265
TALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.

1780
01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:18,206
LAURA: I gingerly put it in my quiver.

1781
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:19,233
ORION: More like a shotgun.

1782
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:20,106
TALIESIN: It'll get better. It'll get better.

1783
01:18:20,106 --> 01:18:20,983
TRAVIS: Can you make me an explosive axe?

1784
01:18:20,983 --> 01:18:22,161
MATT: You very gingerly place it within your
quiver.

1785
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:23,040
LAURA: Oh god, all right.

1786
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,914
TALIESIN: I don't think you want an explosive
axe.

1787
01:18:23,914 --> 01:18:24,908
MATT: It's heavy in the tip.

1788
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:25,643
TRAVIS: Why?

1789
01:18:25,643 --> 01:18:26,475
MATT: It's one of those things where, you know,
shooting it is

1790
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:27,426
going to be an interesting challenge.

1791
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:28,748
LAURA: Should I keep it away from the rest of my
stuff?

1792
01:18:28,748 --> 01:18:29,625
MATT: That's up to you!

1793
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:31,069
LAURA: Is there a possibility it could explode
just--

1794
01:18:31,069 --> 01:18:32,001
ORION: You haven't even played with your hammer
yet!

1795
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:32,779
MATT: I dunno.

1796
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:35,121
TALIESIN: It's very unlikely to explode on by
itself. 'Cause it needs to be moving at a high

1797
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:39,098
speed. But it's just not the best thing ever.

1798
01:18:39,098 --> 01:18:40,843
LAURA: Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my
head.

1799
01:18:40,843 --> 01:18:42,120
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. Not straight behind.

1800
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,010
LAURA: Let's just kind of keep it down at my
waist--

1801
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:44,956
LIAM: Off to the side.

1802
01:18:44,956 --> 01:18:46,041
LAURA: With the dagger, maybe.

1803
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:46,626
MATT: Okay.

1804
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:47,731
LAURA: Is that cool?

1805
01:18:47,731 --> 01:18:49,273
TALIESIN: The next one will be better.

1806
01:18:49,273 --> 01:18:50,027
MATT: All right.

1807
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,452
LAURA: All right. Did we all rest? Are we all
rested?

1808
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:52,169
TALIESIN: Yep.

1809
01:18:52,169 --> 01:18:55,953
MATT: As the evening transpires, you all get your
evenings of rest, you guys kind of keeping watch,

1810
01:18:55,953 --> 01:19:03,579
gambling away. At a certain point, throughout the
evening, something perks up your ears. You begin

1811
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:07,442
hearing footsteps, many footsteps.

1812
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:08,480
LIAM: Many footsteps.

1813
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,575
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no. How many is many? A lot.

1814
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:11,799
LIAM: How many does it sound like?

1815
01:19:11,799 --> 01:19:13,703
MATT: It sounds like anywhere between six, ten,
more--

1816
01:19:13,703 --> 01:19:16,097
LIAM: From, right, from up? Or down.

1817
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:16,854
MATT: From above, yeah.

1818
01:19:16,854 --> 01:19:17,682
LIAM: From above.

1819
01:19:17,682 --> 01:19:18,473
TRAVIS: Up. Oh.

1820
01:19:18,473 --> 01:19:19,422
LAURA: We should wake up.

1821
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:20,242
ASHLEY: From above?

1822
01:19:20,242 --> 01:19:21,025
TRAVIS: Like, the ceiling? Or--

1823
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:21,762
LAURA: Well like the-- no, no, no. From like--

1824
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:22,610
ASHLEY: Like where you have the--

1825
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,565
LAURA: Up the path, right?

1826
01:19:23,565 --> 01:19:24,320
MATT: Up the path you guys came from.

1827
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,277
LIAM: Wait. Grog and I are the only ones awake,
right?

1828
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:25,878
ASHLEY: That he shielded off?

1829
01:19:25,878 --> 01:19:26,578
ORION: Yeah, it's sealed.

1830
01:19:26,578 --> 01:19:27,247
TRAVIS: Yep.

1831
01:19:27,247 --> 01:19:27,706
MATT: Yep.

1832
01:19:27,706 --> 01:19:28,450
LIAM: Grog and I are the only ones awake.

1833
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:28,917
ORION: Right.

1834
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:30,873
LIAM: Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these
tents? Or do we get everyone up?

1835
01:19:30,873 --> 01:19:35,208
LAURA: They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off
the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry.

1836
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:35,621
LIAM: Yeah.

1837
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:36,472
ASHLEY: I'm still awake.

1838
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:37,629
TRAVIS: Lay low. Let them come.

1839
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:39,145
LIAM: I think so.

1840
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:42,282
LAURA: (whispers) What? You're just really--

1841
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:43,471
TRAVIS: Keep sleeping and shut up!

1842
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:45,811
LIAM: No, no, no, I rouse my sister quietly.

1843
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:46,559
LAURA: What?

1844
01:19:46,559 --> 01:19:47,431
TRAVIS: Oh. Fine.

1845
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:48,257
LIAM: She's in this tent.

1846
01:19:48,257 --> 01:19:49,222
TRAVIS: Wake her up.

1847
01:19:49,222 --> 01:19:50,031
LAURA: What's going--

1848
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:52,248
LIAM: (whispers) Quiet.

1849
01:19:52,248 --> 01:19:54,096
MATT: All right. Leaving the rest asleep?

1850
01:19:54,096 --> 01:19:54,671
LIAM: Yeah.

1851
01:19:54,671 --> 01:19:55,962
LAURA: I stealth.

1852
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:56,983
MATT: The three of you make a stealth check.

1853
01:19:56,983 --> 01:19:58,394
TRAVIS: I stealth as well.

1854
01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:00,353
MATT: You do, Grog. You do.

1855
01:20:00,353 --> 01:20:01,082
LAURA: God damn.

1856
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:02,181
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! A two!

1857
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,221
LAURA: I should stop rolling this fucking dice.

1858
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:04,376
TRAVIS: 17.

1859
01:20:04,376 --> 01:20:05,347
ASHLEY: Wait, are you guys asleep?

1860
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:06,151
LIAM: 23.

1861
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:06,980
MARISHA: I'm still passed out.

1862
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,218
LAURA: Oh! Yeah, that was a one. This, by the
way--

1863
01:20:08,218 --> 01:20:08,994
MATT: Again?

1864
01:20:08,994 --> 01:20:10,086
LAURA: -- was given to me by Wil Wheaton.

1865
01:20:10,086 --> 01:20:11,218
TRAVIS: Yeah. Wake up your sister.

1866
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:12,268
LAURA: Thank you, Wil.

1867
01:20:12,268 --> 01:20:13,442
TRAVIS: It was just us boys--

1868
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,472
MATT: Thank you, Wil.

1869
01:20:14,472 --> 01:20:15,700
TRAVIS: -- and then you woke her up.

1870
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,457
MATT: All right, so--

1871
01:20:16,457 --> 01:20:17,532
ASHLEY: Wait, I was awake too.

1872
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:18,245
MATT: You were awake too?

1873
01:20:18,245 --> 01:20:18,873
ASHLEY: Yes.

1874
01:20:18,873 --> 01:20:19,727
MATT: At this point? You weren't resting?

1875
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:20,444
TRAVIS: What. You?

1876
01:20:20,444 --> 01:20:21,067
LAURA: No, she was--

1877
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:21,840
TRAVIS: Oh, she was actually awake.

1878
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,970
ASHLEY: Because I was, I was still at full--

1879
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:23,953
LAURA: (whispers) But you needed your spells.

1880
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:24,629
MATT: Okay, then--

1881
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:25,553
ASHLEY: Oh, but my spells? Actually--

1882
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:27,037
MATT: If you're not resting you don't get your
spells back.

1883
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:27,854
ORION: Yeah, you need--

1884
01:20:27,854 --> 01:20:30,590
ASHLEY: -- I fell asleep! I totally forgot. I am
sound asleep.

1885
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:31,537
MARISHA: Totally forgot I fell asleep!

1886
01:20:31,537 --> 01:20:32,454
ASHLEY: I was dreaming--

1887
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:33,811
TRAVIS: She dreamed, in the dream she was still
awake.

1888
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:34,969
MATT: You are welcome to stay awake if you want,
but you just won't get your spells back.

1889
01:20:34,969 --> 01:20:36,023
ASHLEY: I was dreaming, it was real--

1890
01:20:36,023 --> 01:20:36,677
MATT: You'd probably be exhausted.

1891
01:20:36,677 --> 01:20:37,609
ASHLEY: -- I was so confused, by my dream.

1892
01:20:37,609 --> 01:20:38,573
TALIESIN: You were just going all Inception on
us.

1893
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:39,392
LIAM: You know, when you can't fall asleep--

1894
01:20:39,392 --> 01:20:40,121
ASHLEY: My perception was off.

1895
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:41,780
LIAM: -- and you're like, am I dreaming? Or is
this the dream? Or is it real?

1896
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,701
TALIESIN: Spin the top. Spin the top.

1897
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:43,387
ASHLEY: I was totally sleeping.

1898
01:20:43,387 --> 01:20:44,315
LIAM: And you wake up, and you have to pee, it's
hard to tell.

1899
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:45,336
ASHLEY: And I spaced.

1900
01:20:45,336 --> 01:20:46,412
TRAVIS: So the three of us are up.

1901
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:47,467
ASHLEY: I was asleep.

1902
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:50,536
MATT: All right. So. Between the three of you,
thankfully, you had two successes against one

1903
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:52,865
failure. You manage to cover for your sister--

1904
01:20:52,865 --> 01:20:53,575
LIAM: Shake it off.

1905
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:54,272
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

1906
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,205
MATT: -- who, who, 'Huh? What? What?'

1907
01:20:55,205 --> 01:20:55,971
LAURA: Ah-- what? What?

1908
01:20:55,971 --> 01:20:56,789
MATT: When you wake her up.

1909
01:20:56,789 --> 01:20:57,860
LIAM: Sh! Sh.

1910
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:04,482
MATT: You guys quietly wait--

1911
01:21:04,482 --> 01:21:05,545
TRAVIS: Oh no, that was a bad expression!

1912
01:21:05,545 --> 01:21:06,911
LIAM: Daggers out! Daggers out!

1913
01:21:06,911 --> 01:21:08,518
ASHLEY: Or that was good?

1914
01:21:08,518 --> 01:21:10,071
MATT: All right. So.

1915
01:21:10,071 --> 01:21:11,228
LAURA: Oh no. Did eyebrows go up?

1916
01:21:11,228 --> 01:21:12,460
TALIESIN: (whistles In the Hall of the Mountain
King)

1917
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:17,775
MATT: The footsteps progress through, and you--
there's no light source, as duergar for the most

1918
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:19,559
part do not require light to see in the tunnels.

1919
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:21,151
LAURA: Can we see through the dark-- but we can
see in the dark?

1920
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:23,125
MATT: You guys have low-light vision, not dark
vision.

1921
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,035
LIAM: Not dark vision.

1922
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:25,395
LAURA: There's no light in this area at all?

1923
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:26,267
TRAVIS: No! It's balls-ass dark!

1924
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,116
LIAM: There's no fire--

1925
01:21:27,116 --> 01:21:28,081
MATT: No, it is pitch black. You just hear--

1926
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:28,921
LIAM: On purpose no fire.

1927
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:30,418
MATT: -- you just hear the footprints go by.

1928
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,217
TRAVIS: Good thing we didn't make a campfire!

1929
01:21:31,217 --> 01:21:32,090
LIAM: Sh, sh!

1930
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,540
MATT: You hear them approach the outskirts of the
alcove.

1931
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,061
ASHLEY: I have dark vision, gosh dang it!

1932
01:21:37,061 --> 01:21:37,916
MATT: But you're asleep.

1933
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:39,291
ASHLEY: I'm fucking sleeping.

1934
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:40,516
MATT: Yes, you are.

1935
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:41,745
(all laugh)

1936
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:43,498
ASHLEY: Bad choices, all around!

1937
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,850
LIAM: They're going!

1938
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:50,020
MATT: As the footsteps approach the outskirts of
the alcove, the rest of you sleeping soundly,

1939
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:58,030
unaware of what's transpiring-- A few moments
pass, and the footprints appear to be passing,

1940
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:02,640
past, downward into the tunnel.

1941
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,451
(all laugh)

1942
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:08,970
MATT: Eventually, when the footfalls dissipate,
and silence once again takes the camp, you breathe

1943
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:12,015
a sigh of relief and remove your hand from Vex's
face.

1944
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:14,188
TRAVIS: Well, maybe just leave it there.

1945
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:16,093
LIAM: Last time I did that I got kicked in the
nuts, very hard.

1946
01:22:16,093 --> 01:22:19,780
TRAVIS: And liked it.

1947
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,468
MATT: All right. So. Eventually, when you feel
enough time has passed, where those who've been

1948
01:22:25,468 --> 01:22:30,571
resting come from their sleep, spells recovered,
wounds are healed, except for those who didn't

1949
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:33,942
sleep, you guys maintain the same health you had
previously.

1950
01:22:33,942 --> 01:22:38,094
ASHLEY: What a good sleep I've had! I have all my
spells back!

1951
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:41,254
MATT: That also puts a level of exhaustion-- So.
There is one level of

1952
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,105
exhaustion on both of you currently.

1953
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:44,129
LIAM: Sure. So what does that do to us?

1954
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:44,778
LAURA: Oh no.

1955
01:22:44,778 --> 01:22:45,390
ORION: Ah. You fools!

1956
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:46,531
MATT: It just means any ability checks you take--

1957
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:47,272
LIAM: Yes.

1958
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:48,260
MATT: So, any skills you take are at disadvantage
until you get a full night's rest.

1959
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,218
TRAVIS: I'll take one more level two potion right
now.

1960
01:22:49,218 --> 01:22:50,365
LIAM: Skill? Skill. Okay.

1961
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:51,524
TRAVIS: One more level two potion.

1962
01:22:51,524 --> 01:22:55,817
MATT: Okay. You can use-- remember, you can use
your hit dice to heal still, before you start

1963
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:57,718
throwing potions around. If you have a moment to
rest--

1964
01:22:57,718 --> 01:22:59,980
LAURA: Hit dice. We forgot about that because it
wasn't there before.

1965
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:04,220
MATT: Yeah. (sings) Fifth Edition! Before you
start throwing potions around, 'cause remember,

1966
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:09,208
you're far away from civilization right now, you
have a very limited number of potions now to lead

1967
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,541
you through here, unless you find some way to
return to the surface.

1968
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:15,954
LIAM: Just for emergencies.

1969
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:16,529
ORION: What's happening?

1970
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:17,389
LIAM: In combat.

1971
01:23:17,389 --> 01:23:21,403
MATT: So. You all eventually come back to
consciousness, in this darkened alcove, pitch

1972
01:23:21,403 --> 01:23:27,866
black. It is still warm, slight smell of soot and
dust in the air, what do you guys want to do?

1973
01:23:27,866 --> 01:23:29,088
LIAM: I have a question.

1974
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:29,801
MATT: Yes.

1975
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:35,097
LIAM: Outside of existence. Tiberius put up a
stone, right?

1976
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:35,811
MATT: Mm-hm.

1977
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:38,310
LIAM: But I didn't hear any (impact sounds),
right?

1978
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:43,015
LAURA: Oh, no, he put it up next to our alcove.
So, they just kind of passed by our alcove.

1979
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:44,548
MATT: It basically matched the wall as you guys
went around.

1980
01:23:44,548 --> 01:23:46,550
LIAM: Oh. So we sealed ourselves into this little
pocket?

1981
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:47,464
LAURA: Yes. We did.

1982
01:23:47,464 --> 01:23:50,286
LIAM: Oh. We didn't even friggin' need to hide in
the tent! We were in a little bubble of air!

1983
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:51,973
LAURA: Well, no, well, it's pillars, though, they
could have--

1984
01:23:51,973 --> 01:23:52,946
MATT: You're not completely in there.

1985
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:53,810
LAURA: -- they could have seen us.

1986
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:54,278
LIAM: Okay.

1987
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:56,174
MATT: He could block off most of it, there's like
little spaces between--

1988
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:57,667
LIAM: Spaces. Okay. All right. Thank you.

1989
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:02,831
LAURA: I think we should all freshen up, since
it's a new day!

1990
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:05,591
LIAM: Right. We're all healed, maybe-- Does anyone
have to pee? Or perhaps--

1991
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:06,460
LAURA: Yeah, that.

1992
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,102
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1993
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:07,771
LAURA: That.

1994
01:24:07,771 --> 01:24:08,528
ORION: Is anyone particularly dirty?

1995
01:24:08,528 --> 01:24:09,584
LAURA: Intermission!

1996
01:24:09,584 --> 01:24:13,641
MATT: Indeed. So. This, given the point in time
that you all wake from your slumber, we'll

1997
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:16,455
continue this in a few minutes. In the meantime,
we're gonna go ahead and go to our intermission

1998
01:24:16,455 --> 01:24:19,524
break. See you guys back here in about 12 minutes
or so.

1999
01:24:19,524 --> 01:24:20,448
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

2000
01:24:20,448 --> 01:24:22,643
ZAC: So we're gonna update everyone real quick.

2001
01:24:22,643 --> 01:24:23,565
MATT: All right, what you got, man?

2002
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:25,205
ZAC: You guys can go, you guys can go.

2003
01:24:25,205 --> 01:24:26,125
MATT: Go, go!

2004
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,235
ZAC: Matt and I are gonna chat. Lucas, can you
turn down all the

2005
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:29,271
other mics while they're exiting?

2006
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:30,799
(fart noises in background)

2007
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:35,641
ZAC: So guys, we already gave away one promo kit,
so we reached our first goal.

2008
01:24:35,641 --> 01:24:36,855
MATT: Awesome. Fantastic.

2009
01:24:36,855 --> 01:24:39,001
ZAC: That's one. I'm gonna bring out a poster for
you guys to sign that

2010
01:24:39,001 --> 01:24:40,272
we'll put inside the promo kit with it.

2011
01:24:40,272 --> 01:24:41,085
MATT: Perfect.

2012
01:24:41,085 --> 01:24:44,964
ZAC: And we're actually pretty close to giving
away our second promo kit. So, just so you guys

2013
01:24:44,964 --> 01:24:52,470
know-- what the shit? If we get another 50, I
think it's like 40 more, or 38 more? The number's

2014
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:56,838
on the bottom. We'll give away another promo kit,
and these guys will all sign the poster that goes

2015
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:59,958
inside, and we'll get that shipped out to you as
quickly as possible.

2016
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,104
MATT: Yeah, do it.

2017
01:25:01,104 --> 01:25:04,292
ZAC: That's pretty much the only update there. Oh,
do you want to make a quick mention about the

2018
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:08,346
charity that you guys work with? Because we've
been posting that in the chat room.

2019
01:25:08,346 --> 01:25:13,100
MATT: Yes, yes. Yes, 826LA, guys, is a charity
that we've been been trying to raise money for.

2020
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:20,872
Essentially, it's a Los Angeles-based, also in San
Francisco and other parts of the nation. It helps

2021
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:26,388
teach and tutor children in literacy,
storytelling-- it's a really great charity. Go

2022
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:31,036
ahead and look on the website 826LA.com for any
and all information you require on it. But they

2023
01:25:31,036 --> 01:25:34,339
are a really good cause, they're good people, and
been a fan of their work for a long time. So we

2024
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:37,610
are happy to help however we can and however you
guys are able to help as well. So.

2025
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:42,684
ZAC: Great. If the mods want to post the command
'criticalrole', you guys can link to that charity

2026
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:46,292
and we'll go ahead and roll those videos so you
guys can get updated on the characters, and we'll

2027
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:47,386
be back in a little bit.

2028
01:25:47,386 --> 01:25:48,609
MATT: See you guys in a little bit.

2029
01:25:48,609 --> 01:39:10,824
[character intros]

2030
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:14,408
MATT: Welcome back, guys. All right, I think
everyone is

2031
01:39:14,473 --> 01:39:17,575
sufficiently rested and bathroom breaked.

2032
01:39:17,575 --> 01:39:18,093
LAURA: Yep.

2033
01:39:18,093 --> 01:39:23,598
MATT: And so we will pick it back up. So as you
all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for

2034
01:39:23,598 --> 01:39:29,246
the day ahead, once again, you've gone a number of
days without sunlight, without any vision of the

2035
01:39:29,331 --> 01:39:32,788
sky. It's a very disorienting experience for all
of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean

2036
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:37,341
territory. Even though you are rested, you don't
feel rested. There's kinks in your back from the

2037
01:39:37,341 --> 01:39:41,498
rocky floor. The best you could find yourself any
sort of comfort here is from whatever you have on

2038
01:39:41,498 --> 01:39:48,755
your back. Most of you sleep in your armor out of
necessity and paranoia. As consciousness comes to

2039
01:39:48,755 --> 01:39:55,269
you, you guys are able to try and find your way
back out now that you've been sealed in.

2040
01:39:55,269 --> 01:39:57,162
LAURA: Can we squish through the little cracks?

2041
01:39:57,162 --> 01:39:57,907
MATT: No.

2042
01:39:57,907 --> 01:39:58,875
LAURA: We have to cut it down?

2043
01:39:58,875 --> 01:40:03,310
MATT: You have about a five, six-inch gap between
each of them.

2044
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:06,250
LAURA: So we've gotta break our way out of here,
Grog.

2045
01:40:06,316 --> 01:40:07,950
TRAVIS: Oh, do I get to hit things?

2046
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,003
MATT: You do.

2047
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,088
LIAM: Start smacking the wall.

2048
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:10,848
TRAVIS: My god.

2049
01:40:10,848 --> 01:40:13,741
ASHLEY: Can I just give it a try, just to see? Try
make a dent.

2050
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,762
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make an athletics check.

2051
01:40:15,762 --> 01:40:20,009
TRAVIS: And just to try it out, I would like bring
out the flaming hammer of--

2052
01:40:20,009 --> 01:40:22,957
MATT: Actually, for this I would say it's a
straight strength check. This is just physicality,

2053
01:40:22,957 --> 01:40:26,909
strength against the stonework.

2054
01:40:26,909 --> 01:40:29,132
LIAM: Might need to take your armor off.

2055
01:40:29,132 --> 01:40:30,009
ASHLEY: Strength is?

2056
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:30,605
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2057
01:40:30,605 --> 01:40:31,264
LAURA: Oh, it's right here.

2058
01:40:31,264 --> 01:40:33,346
TRAVIS: 23.

2059
01:40:33,414 --> 01:40:35,210
MATT: All right.

2060
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,280
TRAVIS: With the hammer.

2061
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:36,797
ASHLEY: Ten.

2062
01:40:36,797 --> 01:40:38,339
MARISHA: We're playing pillar pinata.

2063
01:40:38,339 --> 01:40:44,147
MATT: All right, so as Pike-- as you go and swing
at the pillar, you impact with all your might and

2064
01:40:44,147 --> 01:40:49,101
the pillar cracks at the impact. You're like,
'that is awesome', then you look up a few inches

2065
01:40:49,188 --> 01:40:51,197
and notice that Grog's ax is also in the same
pillar.

2066
01:40:51,197 --> 01:40:51,779
ASHLEY: Oh.

2067
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,116
(all laugh)

2068
01:40:53,116 --> 01:40:54,356
ASHLEY: Yay teamwork, teamwork.

2069
01:40:54,356 --> 01:40:55,917
TRAVIS: Yay, you loosened it up for me.

2070
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:56,852
ASHLEY: Yeah I did!

2071
01:40:56,852 --> 01:40:57,565
MARISHA: Yeah.

2072
01:40:57,565 --> 01:40:58,912
LIAM: (singing) That's fuckin' teamwork.

2073
01:40:58,912 --> 01:41:00,612
ASHLEY: Best pals!

2074
01:41:00,612 --> 01:41:06,319
MATT: You guys, you take five or six minutes or
so. You manage to hack away enough in one of the

2075
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:12,319
pillars to leave enough room to squeeze through.
It takes a while. You manage to cleave that open.

2076
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:17,411
You all gather your things, you group together and
you can continue in whichever direction you wish.

2077
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:18,683
ASHLEY: Down.

2078
01:41:18,683 --> 01:41:20,038
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going down.

2079
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:22,483
MATT: All right, as you guys--

2080
01:41:22,483 --> 01:41:23,704
LAURA: Stealth!

2081
01:41:23,704 --> 01:41:27,724
LIAM: There are also some, I believe some duergar
we didn't tell you--

2082
01:41:27,724 --> 01:41:28,935
LAURA: Ahead of us.

2083
01:41:28,935 --> 01:41:35,110
LIAM: Yes, while you were sleeping in the middle
of the night, duergar walked-- I assume--

2084
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:35,853
LAURA: Dooragar?

2085
01:41:35,853 --> 01:41:36,599
LIAM: Duraga.

2086
01:41:36,599 --> 01:41:38,841
LIAM: (in odd accent) Duergar, some duergar walked
down the passageway while you were sleeping.

2087
01:41:38,841 --> 01:41:39,689
TALIESIN: Doo-agar.

2088
01:41:39,689 --> 01:41:40,290
ORION: Duragar.

2089
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,354
ASHLEY: Dooagar.

2090
01:41:41,354 --> 01:41:43,773
LIAM: But we thought it best to lay low and they
went on.

2091
01:41:43,773 --> 01:41:44,383
MARISHA: That's good.

2092
01:41:44,383 --> 01:41:45,187
LAURA: Yes.

2093
01:41:45,187 --> 01:41:46,337
LIAM: So, steady as she goes.

2094
01:41:46,337 --> 01:41:47,174
LAURA: They might be ahead of us.

2095
01:41:47,174 --> 01:41:48,112
TALIESIN: We should probably be quiet.

2096
01:41:48,112 --> 01:41:50,599
MARISHA: Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and
take a minute to meditate. If you guys can, you

2097
01:41:50,599 --> 01:41:52,597
know, just watch while I meditate.

2098
01:41:52,597 --> 01:41:53,425
TALIESIN: Oh god.

2099
01:41:53,425 --> 01:41:54,589
LAURA: And lend our energy to you.

2100
01:41:54,589 --> 01:41:58,978
MARISHA: Yes, if you guys could lend your positive
energy it would be very helpful.

2101
01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:00,042
TRAVIS: (fart sounds)

2102
01:42:00,042 --> 01:42:01,225
MARISHA: So I can Commune With Nature.

2103
01:42:01,431 --> 01:42:02,421
TALIESIN: I'll be out of the hole.

2104
01:42:02,421 --> 01:42:04,257
MARISHA: I want to do Commune (pronouncing
incorrectly) With Nature.

2105
01:42:04,257 --> 01:42:05,509
MATT: Commune? (pronouncing correctly)

2106
01:42:05,509 --> 01:42:07,168
MARISHA: Yes, or Commune, whatever.

2107
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:08,645
MATT: You wanna start a commune in nature?

2108
01:42:08,645 --> 01:42:09,452
TRAVIS: Commune.

2109
01:42:09,452 --> 01:42:10,307
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to start a commune in
nature.

2110
01:42:10,307 --> 01:42:11,219
TALIESIN: Commune in a commune.

2111
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:12,852
ORION: Can we do that? How high is that roll
again?

2112
01:42:12,852 --> 01:42:13,920
MARISHA: Commune in commune in a commune.

2113
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,063
LIAM: Going the homeopathic route, I like it.

2114
01:42:15,063 --> 01:42:15,886
MARISHA: That one.

2115
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:18,533
MATT: Okay, keeping the best essence--

2116
01:42:18,533 --> 01:42:19,756
TALIESIN: Oh god.

2117
01:42:19,756 --> 01:42:27,201
MATT: -- of the scenery around you, you take a
moment. What's the reach of that one?

2118
01:42:27,201 --> 01:42:38,049
MARISHA: Just read it, where is it?

2119
01:42:38,049 --> 01:42:38,887
MATT: Whatcha got?

2120
01:42:38,887 --> 01:42:40,230
MARISHA: Three miles.

2121
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:44,279
MATT: Three miles. The natural entities that you
can sense in this cavern system are the few

2122
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:57,358
clusters of bats that exist in the back portion of
the war camp that you guys just ran from. That's

2123
01:42:57,358 --> 01:43:02,029
about it, I mean, there are a few other strange
things that you've seen that live down here, but

2124
01:43:02,029 --> 01:43:04,251
they wouldn't be anything that you would naturally
sense.

2125
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:07,306
TRAVIS: What more do you see?

2126
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:12,598
MARISHA: Lots of bats. They're very nice bats

2127
01:43:12,598 --> 01:43:13,466
TRAVIS: Well, that's good.

2128
01:43:13,466 --> 01:43:14,280
ORION: I love bats.

2129
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:17,629
MARISHA: Very pleasant, they're very friendly.
That's about it.

2130
01:43:17,629 --> 01:43:18,367
ORION: Very good.

2131
01:43:18,367 --> 01:43:19,278
LAURA: Bats.

2132
01:43:19,278 --> 01:43:20,545
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bats.

2133
01:43:20,545 --> 01:43:22,016
MARISHA: Okay, carry on, let's go.

2134
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:22,951
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

2135
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:23,600
LAURA: All right.

2136
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,563
MARISHA: Thank you for your positive energy.

2137
01:43:24,563 --> 01:43:25,063
LAURA: Nice.

2138
01:43:25,063 --> 01:43:27,725
MATT: All right, you guys step back into the
tunnel, all of you squeezing through with the rest

2139
01:43:27,725 --> 01:43:35,154
of your materials, heading further down. About 15
minutes of travel go by and the very air itself is

2140
01:43:35,154 --> 01:43:37,464
becoming steadily warmer.

2141
01:43:37,464 --> 01:43:38,951
TALIESIN: It's humid in here.

2142
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:46,490
MATT: The smell is this combination of still
water, groundwater type of a scent mixed with an

2143
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:51,808
ever-growing kind of sulfur-type, brimstone
smell.

2144
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,128
LIAM: Smells like Grog.

2145
01:43:53,319 --> 01:43:55,280
TRAVIS: I would like to trip Vax.

2146
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,404
(all laugh)

2147
01:43:56,404 --> 01:43:57,331
LIAM: That was quick.

2148
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:58,333
(all laugh)

2149
01:43:58,333 --> 01:43:59,330
TRAVIS: As he's walking.

2150
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:04,293
LIAM: I insult you and you trip me in a half a
second? Would you like to take a shot at my nads

2151
01:44:04,293 --> 01:44:05,474
as well?

2152
01:44:05,474 --> 01:44:07,044
LAURA: You knew it was coming, as well.

2153
01:44:07,044 --> 01:44:08,017
MATT: Make an athletics check.

2154
01:44:08,017 --> 01:44:12,323
TRAVIS: Yes! 24!

2155
01:44:12,323 --> 01:44:13,653
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

2156
01:44:13,653 --> 01:44:14,918
TRAVIS: Suck it, elf.

2157
01:44:14,918 --> 01:44:20,836
LIAM: What goes around comes around, baby. 22.

2158
01:44:20,836 --> 01:44:22,449
MARISHA: Ooh.

2159
01:44:22,449 --> 01:44:25,727
MATT: (impact sound) Face down, Vax.

2160
01:44:25,727 --> 01:44:26,546
TRAVIS: Yes!

2161
01:44:26,546 --> 01:44:29,962
MATT: A slight bruise on the cheek as you go
faceplanting into the stonework ahead of you.

2162
01:44:29,962 --> 01:44:30,859
TALIESIN: For god's sake.

2163
01:44:30,859 --> 01:44:33,043
LIAM: I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit
point.

2164
01:44:33,043 --> 01:44:39,360
TRAVIS: What, what happened? What happened? Did
you not stealth past that little pebble?

2165
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:45,921
LIAM: It's all right, when the illithid general is
bearing down on your walnut-sized brain--

2166
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:46,775
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2167
01:44:46,775 --> 01:44:48,277
LIAM: I may be there, I may not.

2168
01:44:48,277 --> 01:44:51,709
ASHLEY: Hey! Don't be rude to him!

2169
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:52,785
LAURA: You guys, you guys.

2170
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:54,217
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm so happy right now.

2171
01:44:54,217 --> 01:44:55,491
LAURA: These caverns are getting to us.

2172
01:44:55,491 --> 01:44:57,922
(all laugh)

2173
01:44:57,922 --> 01:44:59,838
MATT: Clarota shuffles alongside you guys.

2174
01:44:59,838 --> 01:45:01,515
LIAM: Right, everyone, we're getting slap-happy.

2175
01:45:01,515 --> 01:45:02,809
LAURA: All right, all right, all right, let's call
this.

2176
01:45:02,809 --> 01:45:03,972
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted.

2177
01:45:03,972 --> 01:45:04,715
ASHLEY: Lack of oxygen.

2178
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:05,584
LAURA: We're going crazy down here.

2179
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:06,604
MARISHA: Grog, it's only 9:30 in the morning.

2180
01:45:06,604 --> 01:45:07,448
ORION: I feel fine.

2181
01:45:07,448 --> 01:45:08,480
MARISHA: For christ's sake.

2182
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,889
MATT: As you guys are walking, you're welcome to
make chatter, any discussions you'd like.

2183
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:17,170
LIAM: That was a high acrobatics roll. I think the
DM wanted me to eat shit.

2184
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:18,334
MATT: No, it was yours versus his.

2185
01:45:18,334 --> 01:45:18,988
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2186
01:45:18,988 --> 01:45:19,481
LAURA: Yeah.

2187
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:20,382
LIAM: Oh, really? It was a direct contest?

2188
01:45:20,382 --> 01:45:21,613
MATT: It was a direct versus 24 versus 22. He
won.

2189
01:45:21,613 --> 01:45:22,958
LIAM: You still wanted me to eat shit.

2190
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,899
MATT: No, it's up to the rolls, man.

2191
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:28,790
MARISHA: So wait, we get a chance to chat for a
second?

2192
01:45:28,874 --> 01:45:29,829
ORION: Yes.

2193
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:37,055
MARISHA: Pike, did you ever fully tell us what all
you saw in your vision? I mean, have you perhaps

2194
01:45:37,055 --> 01:45:38,302
had any more visions?

2195
01:45:38,302 --> 01:45:39,671
LAURA: Visions? You had a vision?

2196
01:45:39,671 --> 01:45:40,763
ASHLEY: I did, I did.

2197
01:45:40,763 --> 01:45:41,690
LAURA: What?

2198
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:53,630
ASHLEY: So, when I stayed away, I went to a shrine
of Sarenrae, just to sorta see, 'cause I had a

2199
01:45:53,630 --> 01:46:04,556
feeling that I'd been here, or something like
that. So in this vision, I basically saw what

2200
01:46:04,556 --> 01:46:07,664
we've been going through already.

2201
01:46:07,664 --> 01:46:08,909
MARISHA: What?

2202
01:46:08,909 --> 01:46:21,012
ASHLEY: And what the soldier was talking about. So
I saw something that was-- there was a single

2203
01:46:21,012 --> 01:46:24,350
twisted horn of blackened soul matter.

2204
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:26,038
LAURA: Oh, soul matter?

2205
01:46:26,038 --> 01:46:27,266
MARISHA: Soul matter?

2206
01:46:27,266 --> 01:46:27,951
TALIESIN: Oh.

2207
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:28,797
LIAM: Sounds dirty.

2208
01:46:28,797 --> 01:46:31,970
ASHLEY: It was a point of concentrated evil.

2209
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,063
ORION: Oh.

2210
01:46:33,063 --> 01:46:34,182
LAURA: This horn?

2211
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:35,034
ASHLEY: Yes.

2212
01:46:35,034 --> 01:46:36,084
MARISHA: Concentrated evil.

2213
01:46:36,084 --> 01:46:37,342
ORION: Nasty horn.

2214
01:46:37,342 --> 01:46:44,048
ASHLEY: And it was so strong that I couldn't stay
in the vision, because I could feel that it was

2215
01:46:44,048 --> 01:46:51,268
taking over, so I pulled me out of the dream,
among various things. But I saw--

2216
01:46:51,268 --> 01:46:53,746
MARISHA: Like the horn of Sauron?

2217
01:46:53,746 --> 01:46:55,261
ASHLEY: The horn of Sauron, is what it said.

2218
01:46:55,261 --> 01:46:58,340
ORION: Is that your cousin?

2219
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:59,694
LIAM: Did you see any whales?

2220
01:46:59,694 --> 01:47:00,635
LAURA: The horn of--

2221
01:47:00,635 --> 01:47:01,825
ASHLEY: I didn't see whales.

2222
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:02,639
LIAM: No whales.

2223
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:03,572
LAURA: Okay, no narwhals.

2224
01:47:03,572 --> 01:47:04,676
MARISHA: No whales, no narwhals.

2225
01:47:04,676 --> 01:47:06,600
LAURA: The horn of K'varn, yes?

2226
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,419
ASHLEY: Yes.

2227
01:47:07,419 --> 01:47:08,513
LAURA: Okay.

2228
01:47:08,513 --> 01:47:09,930
MARISHA: Horn of evil.

2229
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:14,812
ASHLEY: I some visions of where sort of-- 'Cause I
kind of went in past and then got to this thing.

2230
01:47:14,812 --> 01:47:18,538
So I guess depending on where we are--

2231
01:47:18,538 --> 01:47:20,870
LAURA: Can you lead in the direction to go?

2232
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:23,860
ASHLEY: Yes, if I see things that are familiar.
Such as--

2233
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:26,697
(all laugh)

2234
01:47:26,697 --> 01:47:34,738
ASHLEY: I went past a jagged onyx-colored fortress
framed in molten rock.

2235
01:47:34,738 --> 01:47:35,759
LIAM: Oh.

2236
01:47:35,759 --> 01:47:36,754
LAURA: I think that probably--

2237
01:47:36,754 --> 01:47:37,801
MARISHA: The place we're heading.

2238
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:38,588
LAURA: The place we're going to.

2239
01:47:38,588 --> 01:47:39,196
ASHLEY: Yes.

2240
01:47:39,196 --> 01:47:40,190
LIAM: That sounds creepy

2241
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,320
ASHLEY: Past a field of broken glass and bone.

2242
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,134
ORION: Right.

2243
01:47:44,134 --> 01:47:45,424
MARISHA: We haven't seen that. Oh no.

2244
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:46,466
TRAVIS: Obsidian, maybe?

2245
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:47,527
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2246
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:48,755
TALIESIN: Or just melted sand.

2247
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:50,119
TRAVIS: I mean, whatever that is.

2248
01:47:50,119 --> 01:47:59,196
ASHLEY: And the prettiest was into a cavern of
blue crystal, where a fungal fortress--

2249
01:47:59,196 --> 01:48:00,401
LAURA: A fungal fortress?

2250
01:48:00,401 --> 01:48:01,421
MARISHA: Ooh.

2251
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:03,270
ASHLEY: -- sort of entwined an ancient city of
marble and jade--

2252
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:04,502
ORION: Three different places.

2253
01:48:04,502 --> 01:48:05,698
LIAM: That sounds really shitty.

2254
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:07,077
LAURA: Did the blue gemstones look valuable?

2255
01:48:07,077 --> 01:48:08,322
MARISHA: It sounds amazing, that doesn't sound
shitty.

2256
01:48:08,322 --> 01:48:10,690
MATT: As you start to mention that now, Clarota
kind of nods and says,

2257
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:11,849
LIAM: It feels a bit-- broken glass.

2258
01:48:11,849 --> 01:48:15,943
MATT: "Aye, that's where the colony resides."

2259
01:48:15,943 --> 01:48:17,189
LAURA: Your colony?

2260
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:18,546
MATT: "Our great city."

2261
01:48:18,546 --> 01:48:19,995
LIAM: In which of those places? In the--

2262
01:48:19,995 --> 01:48:21,349
LAURA: In the fungal city.

2263
01:48:21,349 --> 01:48:22,453
LIAM: Fungal.

2264
01:48:22,453 --> 01:48:24,597
MATT: "Amongst the ruins of jade and glass."

2265
01:48:24,597 --> 01:48:25,772
LAURA: (whispers) Jade.

2266
01:48:25,772 --> 01:48:26,878
ORION: Is that where we should go?

2267
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:28,599
MARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?

2268
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:29,802
MATT: "Surrounded by the forest."

2269
01:48:29,802 --> 01:48:31,089
MARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?

2270
01:48:31,089 --> 01:48:38,584
MATT: "The city below Yug'Voril, that is where the
temple resides,

2271
01:48:38,584 --> 01:48:43,023
"where K'varn holds the Elder Brain."

2272
01:48:43,023 --> 01:48:44,207
LAURA: Ah.

2273
01:48:44,207 --> 01:48:45,962
ORION: Ah, this is where we need to go, I'm
assuming.

2274
01:48:45,962 --> 01:48:46,829
MATT: "Ah, yes."

2275
01:48:46,829 --> 01:48:48,729
LIAM: He sounds like a real fun-guy.

2276
01:48:48,729 --> 01:48:49,531
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2277
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:51,334
(all groan)

2278
01:48:51,334 --> 01:48:52,601
TALIESIN: Trip him again, trip him again.

2279
01:48:52,601 --> 01:48:53,853
MARISHA: Trip him again!

2280
01:48:53,853 --> 01:48:54,834
LIAM: I'm a dad.

2281
01:48:54,834 --> 01:48:56,609
(all laugh)

2282
01:48:56,609 --> 01:48:57,732
LAURA: So I bet the fortress--

2283
01:48:57,732 --> 01:48:59,062
MATT: Make a will saving throw.

2284
01:48:59,062 --> 01:49:00,695
(all laugh)

2285
01:49:00,695 --> 01:49:03,376
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

2286
01:49:03,376 --> 01:49:04,638
LIAM: What is that? Wisdom?

2287
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:05,308
MATT: Yes.

2288
01:49:05,308 --> 01:49:06,574
LIAM: 12.

2289
01:49:06,574 --> 01:49:13,754
MATT: Okay, you feel a mental slap as Clarota
glares at you from across the tunnel.

2290
01:49:13,754 --> 01:49:18,958
"There'll be none of that in my presence."

2291
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:21,458
TRAVIS: You got bitch-slapped.

2292
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:24,209
MATT: "I hate puns."

2293
01:49:24,209 --> 01:49:25,816
(all laugh)

2294
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:28,395
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) I hate puns.

2295
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:29,827
LIAM: Noted, noted.

2296
01:49:29,827 --> 01:49:35,388
LAURA: So I bet, first fortress you saw, I bet the
one of obsidian was where--

2297
01:49:35,388 --> 01:49:38,430
LIAM: Percy's losing his shit.

2298
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:42,197
ORION: There's a bathroom right over there,
Percy.

2299
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:43,787
LAURA: -- where Lady Kima is being held.

2300
01:49:43,787 --> 01:49:44,762
ASHLEY: I think--

2301
01:49:44,762 --> 01:49:48,447
LAURA: I bet that's the one, because he mentioned
molten lava or something. So she's being held

2302
01:49:48,447 --> 01:49:50,500
there and then further in is K'varn.

2303
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,346
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2304
01:49:51,346 --> 01:49:53,351
ORION: So get there, get K'varn.

2305
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:56,492
MATT: "Yes, Emberhold, yes."

2306
01:49:56,492 --> 01:49:58,225
LAURA: Emberhold, yes. Is that an obsidian
fortress?

2307
01:49:58,225 --> 01:50:00,814
MATT: "It is black and jagged, I think, yes."

2308
01:50:00,814 --> 01:50:03,481
LAURA: Well, let's keep going that way.

2309
01:50:03,481 --> 01:50:05,653
MARISHA: So the ultimate question is, are we
heading the right way? Are we heading the right

2310
01:50:05,653 --> 01:50:07,842
way, Pike, do you know?

2311
01:50:07,842 --> 01:50:09,585
ASHLEY: Can I perception check?

2312
01:50:09,585 --> 01:50:11,608
(all laugh)

2313
01:50:11,608 --> 01:50:16,403
MATT: You guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel,
Clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel. All you

2314
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:19,526
know is it's going down. That's better than up.

2315
01:50:19,526 --> 01:50:20,915
ASHLEY: I feel like that's the way we need to go.

2316
01:50:20,915 --> 01:50:22,265
LAURA: So, just keep going, then?

2317
01:50:22,265 --> 01:50:23,478
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.

2318
01:50:23,478 --> 01:50:24,856
TRAVIS: Do I need to take off running again?

2319
01:50:24,856 --> 01:50:25,812
LAURA: No.

2320
01:50:25,812 --> 01:50:29,306
ASHLEY: I think basically we need to go down,
'cause if we go up that means we're going out.

2321
01:50:29,306 --> 01:50:30,814
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.

2322
01:50:30,814 --> 01:50:32,169
TRAVIS: We can go--

2323
01:50:32,169 --> 01:50:41,909
MATT: You guys press forward and you begin to
encounter little trickles on the ceiling of

2324
01:50:41,909 --> 01:50:45,435
orange, glowing little puddles.

2325
01:50:45,435 --> 01:50:47,285
LAURA: Avoid that!

2326
01:50:47,285 --> 01:50:49,636
MARISHA: If we learned anything from Minecraft--

2327
01:50:49,636 --> 01:50:51,486
(all laugh)

2328
01:50:51,486 --> 01:50:53,090
LAURA: Don't touch that.

2329
01:50:53,090 --> 01:51:01,136
MATT: Progressing further down, you start seeing
large clusters, little pools of molten rock

2330
01:51:01,206 --> 01:51:10,726
beginning to form under certain sections. In a
little ways up, you begin hearing some additional

2331
01:51:10,726 --> 01:51:13,727
footsteps to your own. Further down the tunnel.

2332
01:51:13,727 --> 01:51:17,718
LAURA: Oh. Can we stealth, can we stealth? And my
favored terrain is the Underdark.

2333
01:51:17,718 --> 01:51:18,919
MATT: It is.

2334
01:51:18,919 --> 01:51:20,808
LAURA: I don't know what that means, though.

2335
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:22,343
(all laugh)

2336
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:25,065
LAURA: No, no, no, I know. But I don't know what
favored terrain gives me, because I tried to look

2337
01:51:25,065 --> 01:51:26,506
it up and couldn't find it.

2338
01:51:26,506 --> 01:51:27,769
ASHLEY: You just love it.

2339
01:51:27,769 --> 01:51:29,384
LAURA: Does it give me an advantage?

2340
01:51:29,384 --> 01:51:32,523
MATT: Here, there's a sheet that has all the
information you need.

2341
01:51:32,523 --> 01:51:35,088
LAURA: Oh good, thank you.

2342
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:40,691
ORION: By the way, I take one of the earrings from
Scanlan and give it to Grog.

2343
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:42,760
So Grog, now you've got one of the--

2344
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,964
TRAVIS: I've got an earring?

2345
01:51:43,964 --> 01:51:47,371
MATT: Scanlan is not happy about this.

2346
01:51:47,371 --> 01:51:50,031
ORION: Well? He's not saying anything.

2347
01:51:50,031 --> 01:51:55,134
LIAM: Everyone, there's footsteps coming from
ahead. Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead.

2348
01:51:55,134 --> 01:51:56,687
Wait for a moment.

2349
01:51:56,687 --> 01:51:58,719
LAURA: Yes, okay. Let's go.

2350
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,447
MATT: Stealth checks, both of you.

2351
01:52:00,447 --> 01:52:04,078
LAURA: Yes, finally.

2352
01:52:04,078 --> 01:52:05,215
LIAM: 22 for me.

2353
01:52:05,215 --> 01:52:06,882
MATT: All right.

2354
01:52:06,882 --> 01:52:12,179
LAURA: The same for me, actually. Twinsies.
Sorry.

2355
01:52:12,179 --> 01:52:15,275
MATT: All right, so you guys vanish into the
darkness best as you can tell, kind of weaving

2356
01:52:15,275 --> 01:52:20,528
between the portions of the tunnel that naturally
shift and give you moments where you can hide up

2357
01:52:20,528 --> 01:52:25,284
inside. As you guys hold back, you guys push
ahead, and you can see the little points of

2358
01:52:25,284 --> 01:52:32,454
glowing light where these lava pools every 100 or
so feet begin to appear. You begin listening out,

2359
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:38,961
and you hear these footfalls are very heavy, and
the gait of whoever is walking seems to be wider

2360
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:41,471
than that of the normal humanoid.

2361
01:52:41,538 --> 01:52:43,650
TRAVIS: Ah, let me play. Please.

2362
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:47,372
LIAM: Well it's definitely not duergar. How far
ahead of us do they sound?

2363
01:52:47,372 --> 01:52:49,188
LAURA: Can we see it?

2364
01:52:49,188 --> 01:52:53,670
MATT: Probably a good 60, 70 feet. You hear some
muttering.

2365
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:56,194
LAURA: Can I understand what they're saying?

2366
01:52:56,194 --> 01:52:57,308
MATT: No.

2367
01:52:57,308 --> 01:53:01,585
LIAM: I'm listening, trying to make out how many
sets of footsteps I can hear.

2368
01:53:01,585 --> 01:53:05,488
LAURA: And I look on the ground and see if I can
find multiple sets of footsteps as well.

2369
01:53:05,488 --> 01:53:08,193
MATT: Looking on the ground, you guys have no
light source currently. It's pitch black.

2370
01:53:08,193 --> 01:53:10,847
LIAM: But there's lava spilling and we can see in
dim light.

2371
01:53:10,847 --> 01:53:19,683
MATT: Do you want to go to the nearest lava pool?
All right. It's very, very faint visual. You can

2372
01:53:19,683 --> 01:53:23,552
see there are a number of tracks, up and down. All
different sizes. This area, this tunnel is

2373
01:53:23,552 --> 01:53:35,033
traversed quite a lot. Listening, you hear two
sets of heavy footsteps. And you hear what sounds

2374
01:53:35,033 --> 01:53:39,177
like some sort of squeak sound, like a (squeaks).

2375
01:53:39,177 --> 01:53:41,994
TRAVIS: Shit.

2376
01:53:41,994 --> 01:53:44,363
LIAM: Cart. Could be some sort of device--

2377
01:53:44,363 --> 01:53:53,160
MATT: From around the edge, you can just barely
make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes.

2378
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:56,272
LIAM: Can we tell what they are?

2379
01:53:56,272 --> 01:53:57,925
LAURA: Oh, he's trying to see if they're seeing
us.

2380
01:53:57,925 --> 01:53:59,010
LIAM: Yes.

2381
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:01,932
MATT: They begin to step towards your direction.

2382
01:54:01,932 --> 01:54:03,314
LAURA: We back away.

2383
01:54:03,314 --> 01:54:05,004
MATT: You guys back and kind of flatten yourself
against the wall.

2384
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:08,008
LIAM: Separate sides.

2385
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:15,104
MATT: You can see they're now both dragging behind
them this small roughshod cart,

2386
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:22,280
with something inside it.

2387
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,819
LAURA: We string a rope across the tunnel.

2388
01:54:24,819 --> 01:54:26,171
MATT: Okay, you pull it across.

2389
01:54:26,171 --> 01:54:27,562
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

2390
01:54:27,562 --> 01:54:32,559
MATT: (deep grumbling and laughter)

2391
01:54:32,559 --> 01:54:36,548
LIAM: I also yank my serpentine belt off--

2392
01:54:36,548 --> 01:54:38,167
LAURA: Oh!

2393
01:54:38,215 --> 01:54:40,663
LIAM: And throw it out, right under the rope.

2394
01:54:40,663 --> 01:54:41,779
MATT: Okay.

2395
01:54:41,779 --> 01:54:42,825
LAURA: What does that do?

2396
01:54:42,825 --> 01:54:43,685
LIAM: Snake.

2397
01:54:43,685 --> 01:54:47,526
MATT: So, as he throws the leather, the leather
shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent that

2398
01:54:47,526 --> 01:54:51,534
slips onto the ground, and slithers 
in place, curling up at

2399
01:54:51,612 --> 01:54:53,188
the approaching two monolithic entities.

2400
01:54:53,188 --> 01:54:54,152
LAURA: That is stupid.

2401
01:54:54,152 --> 01:54:55,142
LIAM: Yes, it is.

2402
01:54:55,142 --> 01:54:57,934
LAURA: This is gonna go really poorly.

2403
01:54:57,934 --> 01:55:01,040
MATT: As they begin to cross in front of you, you
both pull taut on the rope.

2404
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,067
LAURA: This is dumb.

2405
01:55:02,067 --> 01:55:11,044
MATT: The immediate one falls forward, tripping
face-first on the ground, a heavy (impact sound).

2406
01:55:11,044 --> 01:55:13,644
You guys hear in the distance this loud thud,
impact sound.

2407
01:55:13,644 --> 01:55:16,472
LAURA: And we call, I go, Grog!

2408
01:55:16,472 --> 01:55:17,871
TRAVIS: I'm raging.

2409
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:20,719
LIAM: And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one.

2410
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:21,631
MATT: All right.

2411
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:22,769
MARISHA: Run!

2412
01:55:22,769 --> 01:55:24,274
MATT: You guys come rushing in, let's go ahead and
roll initiative.

2413
01:55:24,343 --> 01:55:25,372
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2414
01:55:25,372 --> 01:55:27,013
TRAVIS: I raged.

2415
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:28,431
MATT: I figured you were raging.

2416
01:55:28,431 --> 01:55:31,401
TRAVIS: Well, you know, when the ladies call my
name.

2417
01:55:31,401 --> 01:55:33,472
TALIESIN: That sucks.

2418
01:55:33,472 --> 01:55:36,659
MARISHA: That's not too bad, could be worse.

2419
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:40,152
ORION: Yes, sounds good.

2420
01:55:40,152 --> 01:55:41,893
MARISHA: What are we fighting? What are we
fighting?

2421
01:55:41,893 --> 01:55:43,489
LAURA: I know, right? Oh god, here we go.

2422
01:55:43,489 --> 01:55:45,308
MARISHA: What are we fighting, we don't know.

2423
01:55:45,308 --> 01:55:46,325
LAURA: Oh! Lava pools.

2424
01:55:46,325 --> 01:55:47,292
TALIESIN: Lava pools.

2425
01:55:47,292 --> 01:55:48,901
MARISHA: Lava pools, Lava pools.

2426
01:55:48,901 --> 01:55:49,952
TRAVIS: Wow.

2427
01:55:49,952 --> 01:55:51,062
ASHLEY: Wow.

2428
01:55:51,062 --> 01:55:53,613
MARISHA: Grog, you better be throwing bitches into
that lava.

2429
01:55:53,613 --> 01:56:00,181
TRAVIS: Last time I tried to do somebody
to something, I did it to myself, so.

2430
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:01,652
LIAM: Hashtag bitches in lava?

2431
01:56:01,652 --> 01:56:03,022
MARISHA: Hashtag bitches in lava!

2432
01:56:03,022 --> 01:56:04,271
MATT: You guys, coming in this way.

2433
01:56:04,271 --> 01:56:07,053
MARISHA: Bitches in lava, bitches in lava.

2434
01:56:07,053 --> 01:56:10,516
ASHLEY and LAURA: Oh god!

2435
01:56:10,516 --> 01:56:13,969
ORION: She's excited about the lava.

2436
01:56:13,969 --> 01:56:16,806
LIAM: I got 99 problems and a troll ain't one.

2437
01:56:16,806 --> 01:56:18,281
LAURA: Are they trolls, are they ogres?

2438
01:56:18,281 --> 01:56:20,812
MATT: They are two giant ogres.

2439
01:56:20,812 --> 01:56:22,095
LAURA: Oh, god, one's on the ground.

2440
01:56:22,095 --> 01:56:23,240
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2441
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,413
LAURA: It's huge, these are really big.

2442
01:56:25,413 --> 01:56:27,154
MATT: One is back here and one's just fallen over
there.

2443
01:56:27,154 --> 01:56:28,487
ASHLEY: Holy cow.

2444
01:56:28,487 --> 01:56:34,490
MATT: And they are carrying some sort of large
cart-like object, I'll just say for now.

2445
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:36,295
LAURA: This is so dumb, why did we do this?

2446
01:56:36,295 --> 01:56:38,090
TALIESIN: This is a d20.

2447
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:43,416
MATT: Let's say it's about there. All right.

2448
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:44,939
TRAVIS: What's in the cart?

2449
01:56:44,939 --> 01:56:46,510
MATT: So, initiative order, guys?

2450
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:48,091
LAURA: Do we get the surprise at all?

2451
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:51,741
MATT: You do, actually! I'm rolling initiative, so
we have the order. You guys are gonna have a full

2452
01:56:51,741 --> 01:56:53,545
round of surprise on them first.

2453
01:56:53,545 --> 01:56:55,027
LAURA: Okay, cool.

2454
01:56:55,027 --> 01:56:58,094
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

2455
01:56:58,094 --> 01:56:59,160
LAURA: Oh, man, really?

2456
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,018
MATT: 20 to 15?

2457
01:57:00,018 --> 01:57:00,874
ORION: 19.

2458
01:57:00,874 --> 01:57:01,545
LAURA: 15.

2459
01:57:01,545 --> 01:57:02,407
LIAM: 15.

2460
01:57:04,597 --> 01:57:09,297
ORION: I got scared and I cast Stoneskin
immediately.

2461
01:57:09,363 --> 01:57:10,966
ASHLEY: Cast what?

2462
01:57:10,966 --> 01:57:12,131
ORION: Stoneskin.

2463
01:57:12,131 --> 01:57:14,174
MATT: So Vex and Vax, both at 15?

2464
01:57:14,174 --> 01:57:14,924
LAURA: Yeah.

2465
01:57:14,924 --> 01:57:15,762
LIAM: 15, yeah.

2466
01:57:15,762 --> 01:57:16,861
LIAM and LAURA: Oh!

2467
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:17,975
MATT: 15 to ten?

2468
01:57:17,975 --> 01:57:18,800
TALIESIN: 13.

2469
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:19,917
MARISHA: 13 as well.

2470
01:57:19,917 --> 01:57:22,238
ASHLEY: 11.

2471
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:24,333
LAURA: Oh no, Grog, what did you roll?

2472
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:29,489
TRAVIS: I farted when I rolled, I rolled a 9.

2473
01:57:29,489 --> 01:57:31,251
MATT: Oh! Grog.

2474
01:57:31,251 --> 01:57:34,979
ASHLEY: Greg.

2475
01:57:35,047 --> 01:57:38,670
ORION: How much does the ogre weigh? Or the ogres,
as you said?

2476
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:42,828
MATT: The ogres, each one weighs nearly a ton.

2477
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:44,190
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, really?

2478
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,036
LAURA: Oh, they're huge.

2479
01:57:46,036 --> 01:57:47,928
TRAVIS: So, like, 200 pounds.

2480
01:57:47,928 --> 01:57:52,003
MATT and LIAM: Yes.

2481
01:57:52,003 --> 01:57:53,344
LIAM: Yes, exactly.

2482
01:57:53,344 --> 01:57:54,343
MATT: Yes, Grog, close to that.

2483
01:57:54,343 --> 01:57:56,688
LAURA: Yes, Grog.

2484
01:57:56,688 --> 01:58:06,306
MATT: All right, let's go fast here. Here we go.
All right, so, top of the round-- No! Surprise

2485
01:58:06,306 --> 01:58:08,753
round for both of you guys first, as the rest 
of you rush in, so Vex and Vax,

2486
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:10,220
you guys get a surprise round.

2487
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,082
LAURA: Awesome.

2488
01:58:11,082 --> 01:58:12,443
LIAM: I'm already jumping in the air, so I'm gonna
go.

2489
01:58:12,443 --> 01:58:13,619
MATT: To the guy on the ground.

2490
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:18,511
LIAM: Okay, and this, since it's a surprise, it's
automatic crit?

2491
01:58:18,511 --> 01:58:19,431
MATT: Yes!

2492
01:58:19,431 --> 01:58:20,693
LAURA: Oh, nice.

2493
01:58:20,693 --> 01:58:21,481
MARISHA: Hell, yeah!

2494
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:23,346
MATT: He's on the ground, so you get advantage on
your attack rolls.

2495
01:58:23,543 --> 01:58:27,429
LIAM: Okay, okay, all right, so that's 28.

2496
01:58:27,429 --> 01:58:28,937
MATT: That definitively hits.

2497
01:58:28,937 --> 01:58:38,217
LIAM: Yeah, 1d4 for-- this is my poison dagger.
Two, eight, okay, I'm doing my Sneak Attack

2498
01:58:38,217 --> 01:58:54,280
damage, here we go, four, nine, 12, 18, yeah, 23.
Total for that, 62 points of damage.

2499
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:55,769
MATT: 62 points of damage.

2500
01:58:55,769 --> 01:58:59,705
LAURA: Wow.

2501
01:58:59,705 --> 01:59:05,154
MATT: You leap on and entirely eviscerate the
ogre. You jumped onto his back, slashing the back

2502
01:59:05,154 --> 01:59:11,812
of his torso. As you pull open the flesh, you
expose the back of the ribcage, and he goes into

2503
01:59:11,812 --> 01:59:15,277
this kind of gurgling sound as it dies immediately
on the spot.

2504
01:59:15,277 --> 01:59:17,195
LAURA, MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh, what?

2505
01:59:17,195 --> 01:59:22,131
LIAM: And I use my bonus action to hide.

2506
01:59:22,131 --> 01:59:24,007
MATT: Okay.

2507
01:59:24,007 --> 01:59:27,065
TRAVIS: Do you wanna talk to the other one, since--

2508
01:59:27,065 --> 01:59:28,296
LAURA: 62.

2509
01:59:28,296 --> 01:59:31,510
MATT: Okay, roll and make a stealth check.

2510
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:33,133
LIAM: Natural 20.

2511
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:33,941
ORION: Nice.

2512
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:34,908
MATT: All right.

2513
01:59:34,908 --> 01:59:36,584
LIAM: See you later, motherfuckers.

2514
01:59:36,584 --> 01:59:43,005
MATT: The ogre is right there. There is the ogre
on the ground, big squishy ogre.

2515
01:59:43,005 --> 01:59:44,095
LAURA: What?

2516
01:59:44,095 --> 01:59:45,935
TRAVIS: Big squishy ogre.

2517
01:59:46,134 --> 01:59:48,289
MATT: It's considered rough terrain, because now
you have to go over this giant dead body in the

2518
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:50,737
middle of the-- All right, your turn.

2519
01:59:50,737 --> 01:59:56,286
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him, and I'm gonna shoot
him with the explosive arrow.

2520
01:59:56,286 --> 01:59:57,323
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2521
01:59:57,323 --> 01:59:58,627
TRAVIS: I like it.

2522
01:59:58,627 --> 02:00:04,231
LAURA: So I'm gonna see if it hits. I'm gonna use
the blazing bowstring. That's a 22.

2523
02:00:04,231 --> 02:00:06,339
MATT: 22 definitely hits.

2524
02:00:06,339 --> 02:00:19,216
LAURA: Okay. Also, blazing bowstring that gives me
a plus d10. So, okay, 14 plus d10,

2525
02:00:19,216 --> 02:00:20,851
wait, that's a ten? Yeah!

2526
02:00:20,851 --> 02:00:21,974
LIAM: That's a ten.

2527
02:00:21,974 --> 02:00:28,497
LAURA: Plus 19 and then Hunter's Mark! Plus six!

2528
02:00:28,497 --> 02:00:29,884
LIAM: Ah yes!

2529
02:00:29,884 --> 02:00:30,848
MATT: 25.

2530
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:32,159
LAURA: 25, plus whatever the explosive damage is.

2531
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:35,029
MATT: So! As you pull the arrow out, it's a little
wonky, it's actually, what you rolled, it's a

2532
02:00:35,029 --> 02:00:39,164
minus four penalty to hit with it, but you still
manage to hit because it's a big creature, even

2533
02:00:39,164 --> 02:00:43,903
though it's in very big darkness, you-- you know,
in darkness you ignore partial cover.

2534
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:44,968
LAURA: Right!

2535
02:00:44,968 --> 02:00:46,204
LIAM: Bellybutton.

2536
02:00:46,204 --> 02:00:52,177
MATT: You fire it. It arcs slightly, smacks in the
side of its chest and stomach area. It's this

2537
02:00:52,246 --> 02:00:55,733
cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the
immediate vicinity.

2538
02:00:55,733 --> 02:00:56,830
TALIESIN: Whoa! Yes!

2539
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,001
TRAVIS: Yes!

2540
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,842
MATT: It takes an additional 2d8 points of
explosive damage.

2541
02:00:59,842 --> 02:01:00,780
MARISHA: Ooh!

2542
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:01,806
TALIESIN: Yeah!

2543
02:01:01,806 --> 02:01:02,785
ORION: Nice.

2544
02:01:02,785 --> 02:01:06,012
MATT: Nine points, and everything around it also
takes the additional damage--

2545
02:01:06,012 --> 02:01:06,840
LAURA: Oh shit!

2546
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,135
MATT: -- the whole radius does.

2547
02:01:08,135 --> 02:01:09,407
LAURA: Oh, I hope I didn't blow up the cart.

2548
02:01:09,407 --> 02:01:14,529
MATT: The cart-- the wood on the wheels had
shatters and breaks, it falls to one side. What

2549
02:01:14,529 --> 02:01:19,335
you see, some sort of a glass container that was
at the back of the cart shatters and cracks.

2550
02:01:19,335 --> 02:01:20,762
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.

2551
02:01:20,762 --> 02:01:21,778
MARISHA: Oh.

2552
02:01:21,778 --> 02:01:22,771
TALIESIN: I'm still happy.

2553
02:01:22,771 --> 02:01:24,053
LAURA: Welp?

2554
02:01:24,053 --> 02:01:25,526
LIAM: Still pretty cool, still pretty cool.

2555
02:01:25,526 --> 02:01:26,998
MARISHA: Collateral damage. It's bound to happen.

2556
02:01:26,998 --> 02:01:28,677
MATT: Top of the round. Tiberius.

2557
02:01:28,677 --> 02:01:30,204
LAURA: Oh, and can I move away?

2558
02:01:30,204 --> 02:01:31,471
MATT: You can move if you want. Yeah.

2559
02:01:31,471 --> 02:01:32,860
LAURA: Yeah, I move back.

2560
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:34,216
MATT: Back to here?

2561
02:01:34,216 --> 02:01:34,949
LAURA: Yeah. Sounds good.

2562
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:35,804
TRAVIS: Where's your pointer?

2563
02:01:35,804 --> 02:01:36,752
MATT: Use your pointer if you need it.

2564
02:01:36,752 --> 02:01:38,157
LAURA: Oh right! Well, there.

2565
02:01:38,157 --> 02:01:40,569
MATT: All right. Tiberius, you're up first.

2566
02:01:40,569 --> 02:01:45,068
ORION: Very good! I'll take a few steps forward
and be like, well, this is poppycock! And I'll

2567
02:01:45,068 --> 02:01:48,786
shoot a Scorching Ray right at the dude.

2568
02:01:48,786 --> 02:01:50,125
MATT: All right, go for it, roll for the attack.

2569
02:01:50,125 --> 02:01:52,563
LAURA: Does anybody speak Ogre? Nobody speaks
Ogre, though. We can't talk to him.

2570
02:01:52,563 --> 02:01:53,706
TRAVIS: No.

2571
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:54,870
LIAM: They're dumber than Grog is.

2572
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:56,012
ORION: So what am I rolling?

2573
02:01:56,012 --> 02:01:58,281
MATT: Do you ignore partial cover?

2574
02:01:58,281 --> 02:02:00,336
ORION: Oh! Like can I just in general?

2575
02:02:00,336 --> 02:02:01,842
MATT: I mean, did you take that feat?

2576
02:02:01,842 --> 02:02:02,700
ORION: No.

2577
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:09,053
MATT: No. Okay. So yeah. So you're rolling-- okay,
so yeah. So what did you roll to hit?

2578
02:02:09,053 --> 02:02:12,503
ORION: I rolled all three at once. 'Cause I have
to do one for each.

2579
02:02:12,503 --> 02:02:13,340
MATT: Right, yeah.

2580
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,474
ORION: So I got a 12, a 13, and a 12.

2581
02:02:15,474 --> 02:02:18,106
MATT: Okay. All three rays unfortunately miss--

2582
02:02:18,106 --> 02:02:18,915
ORION: Damn it!

2583
02:02:18,915 --> 02:02:22,635
MATT: -- due to the darkness in this room it's
very hard to see, other than the slight glow from

2584
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:26,624
the lava. So you fire all three rays, and you see
them streak through, and each one gives off just

2585
02:02:26,624 --> 02:02:30,723
enough light from the actual flaming ray to glow
to the vicinity, but not the actual target. You

2586
02:02:30,723 --> 02:02:33,617
see them both streak off and slam the wall on the
opposite side.

2587
02:02:33,617 --> 02:02:36,797
ORION: Wait, do I add my dex on those?

2588
02:02:36,797 --> 02:02:39,458
MATT: You add your spell modifier.

2589
02:02:39,458 --> 02:02:40,877
ORION: (whispers) What's my spell modifier?

2590
02:02:40,877 --> 02:02:42,184
MATT: It's on top of your spell page!

2591
02:02:42,184 --> 02:02:47,028
ORION: Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20-- plus nine on
all that.

2592
02:02:47,028 --> 02:02:48,471
MATT: Good to know.

2593
02:02:48,471 --> 02:02:49,475
ORION: Yeah, sorry.

2594
02:02:49,475 --> 02:02:50,486
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

2595
02:02:50,486 --> 02:02:51,473
ORION: Okay.

2596
02:02:51,473 --> 02:02:53,344
MATT: There you go.

2597
02:02:53,344 --> 02:02:57,834
ORION: Okay, first one does five--

2598
02:02:57,834 --> 02:03:00,136
MATT: It's his first time casting spells, guys.
(mouths) It's not.

2599
02:03:00,136 --> 02:03:01,893
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2600
02:03:01,893 --> 02:03:03,013
ORION: -- plus five, ten! I rarely do this one,
kids.

2601
02:03:03,013 --> 02:03:04,153
LIAM: It's part of his charm.

2602
02:03:04,153 --> 02:03:05,001
ORION: Ten on the first one.

2603
02:03:05,001 --> 02:03:06,679
MATT: All right.

2604
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:10,863
ORION: 17 on the second one. And 17 on the second
one.

2605
02:03:10,863 --> 02:03:12,173
LAURA: He's so dead!

2606
02:03:12,173 --> 02:03:13,259
MATT: Okay, is there a saving throw for half
damage?

2607
02:03:13,259 --> 02:03:14,747
ORION: No! I mean, 12 on the third one.

2608
02:03:14,747 --> 02:03:16,422
MATT: Is there a saving throw on this one, or is
it just straight damage?

2609
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:17,374
ORION: Yeah, straight damage.

2610
02:03:17,374 --> 02:03:19,872
MATT: Okay, cool, gotcha. All right.

2611
02:03:19,872 --> 02:03:21,112
ORION: Yes!

2612
02:03:21,112 --> 02:03:25,980
MATT: All right, so you, you blast the ogre with
three. As each explosion hits, you see the

2613
02:03:25,980 --> 02:03:31,855
rippling of its kind of grotesque flesh from the
impact, the third one blasting off a portion of

2614
02:03:31,855 --> 02:03:38,123
its shoulder, exposing this meaty bone and blood.
It gives out this horrible (roars) into the tunnel

2615
02:03:38,123 --> 02:03:43,994
itself, causing just the atmosphere to shake, as
bits of stone begin to rumble and fall from the

2616
02:03:43,994 --> 02:03:48,562
ceiling. All right, that ends your turn?

2617
02:03:48,562 --> 02:03:49,965
ORION: Yeah!

2618
02:03:49,965 --> 02:03:53,311
MATT: Still standing. Barely. It's now its turn.

2619
02:03:53,311 --> 02:03:55,245
LAURA: (gasps)

2620
02:03:55,245 --> 02:03:56,858
MATT: It steps away.

2621
02:03:56,858 --> 02:04:00,504
LIAM: (whispers) You can't see me.

2622
02:04:00,504 --> 02:04:03,471
LAURA: Over the dead body of his brethren.

2623
02:04:03,471 --> 02:04:05,706
MATT: To that point. It's just going to charge
through,

2624
02:04:05,706 --> 02:04:13,551
as all it can see is the figures in the distance.

2625
02:04:13,551 --> 02:04:14,670
MARISHA: Pick me.

2626
02:04:14,670 --> 02:04:22,165
MATT: That's where it is. At which point, the cart
seems to shift slightly.

2627
02:04:22,165 --> 02:04:23,061
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2628
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:24,274
LAURA: Oh no, what did we do?

2629
02:04:24,274 --> 02:04:25,923
LIAM: Oh dear, something's coming out of the jar.

2630
02:04:25,923 --> 02:04:27,204
MARISHA: What did we open?

2631
02:04:27,204 --> 02:04:28,204
LAURA: Oh, god. We let something out.

2632
02:04:28,204 --> 02:04:29,776
MATT: You can see something slowly-- dark
something--

2633
02:04:29,776 --> 02:04:30,931
ORION: I thought it was going to be a good thing!

2634
02:04:30,931 --> 02:04:33,279
MATT: -- amorphous and liquid in nature beginning
to shift in the shadow.

2635
02:04:33,279 --> 02:04:34,240
MARISHA: Oh, great.

2636
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,716
LAURA: Does it-- Oh no-- Is it on fire so we can
see--

2637
02:04:35,716 --> 02:04:36,613
LIAM: No.

2638
02:04:36,613 --> 02:04:37,822
LAURA: -- is it on fire so we can see what it is?

2639
02:04:37,822 --> 02:04:38,517
MATT: No.

2640
02:04:38,517 --> 02:04:39,198
LIAM: No.

2641
02:04:39,198 --> 02:04:39,854
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

2642
02:04:39,854 --> 02:04:40,771
LAURA: The cart wasn't on fire?

2643
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:41,563
LIAM: It's dangerous! It's dangerous! It's fucking
dangerous!

2644
02:04:41,563 --> 02:04:42,495
MATT: It's just this giant, black, liquid--

2645
02:04:42,495 --> 02:04:43,268
MARISHA: What is that?

2646
02:04:43,268 --> 02:04:43,975
MATT: -- ooze-like creature.

2647
02:04:43,975 --> 02:04:45,526
LIAM: It's black ooze. It's dangerous!

2648
02:04:45,526 --> 02:04:46,667
MARISHA: We just opened Pandora's box.

2649
02:04:46,667 --> 02:04:47,595
LAURA: This is really, really bad!

2650
02:04:47,595 --> 02:04:48,781
LIAM: It's fucking dangerous.

2651
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:49,995
LAURA: I'm sorry I exploded it.

2652
02:04:49,995 --> 02:04:51,618
MARISHA: Great. That's good. Good.

2653
02:04:51,618 --> 02:04:53,223
LIAM: Stay away from it. Stay away from it. Stay
away from it.

2654
02:04:53,223 --> 02:04:55,240
TRAVIS: So go wrestle it?

2655
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,424
ASHLEY: So go jump in it, is what you're saying.

2656
02:04:56,424 --> 02:04:57,845
LIAM: French kiss that shit!

2657
02:04:57,845 --> 02:04:58,868
TRAVIS: It's mine!

2658
02:04:58,868 --> 02:05:00,219
LAURA: (whispers) Don't attack it.

2659
02:05:00,219 --> 02:05:01,132
TRAVIS: Don't attack it?

2660
02:05:01,132 --> 02:05:02,384
LAURA: I'm scared of it.

2661
02:05:02,589 --> 02:05:03,111
MARISHA: Black ooze.

2662
02:05:03,111 --> 02:05:04,174
LIAM: Ranged attacks.

2663
02:05:04,174 --> 02:05:04,904
MATT: All right.

2664
02:05:04,904 --> 02:05:05,976
LAURA: What does a black ooze do?

2665
02:05:05,976 --> 02:05:06,793
LIAM: Fire and ranged attacks.

2666
02:05:06,793 --> 02:05:07,659
MARISHA: How do I handle that?

2667
02:05:07,659 --> 02:05:08,410
MATT: So! That brings us to--

2668
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:10,071
TALIESIN: Fire?

2669
02:05:10,071 --> 02:05:10,894
LIAM: Think!

2670
02:05:10,894 --> 02:05:12,351
MATT: Scanlan. Scanlan.

2671
02:05:12,351 --> 02:05:13,391
LAURA: Oh no, oh god, Scanlan.

2672
02:05:13,391 --> 02:05:15,142
MATT: I know you're out there, Scanlan.

2673
02:05:15,142 --> 02:05:16,105
LAURA: Do something amazing, Scanlan!

2674
02:05:16,105 --> 02:05:17,294
LIAM: Sing, Sam! Sing!

2675
02:05:17,294 --> 02:05:22,004
MATT: Scanlan's going to go ahead and sing a song
of inspiration to--

2676
02:05:22,004 --> 02:05:23,584
I'd say Grog just in case he needs to-

2677
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,136
TALIESIN: (sings) When we have to fight the ooze,
you'll never have to lose.

2678
02:05:26,136 --> 02:05:26,870
TRAVIS: What?

2679
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:27,836
LAURA: You received an inspiration.

2680
02:05:27,836 --> 02:05:28,771
TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah, thank you. It's an eight,
right?

2681
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:30,866
MATT: Yeah, it's a d8 inspiration dice.

2682
02:05:30,866 --> 02:05:32,230
LAURA: I want some food. I'm so hungry.

2683
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:34,479
LIAM: (sings) We're up all night in the dark,
we're up all night in the dark.

2684
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:36,540
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (sing) We're up all night in
the dark.

2685
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:37,863
ORION: Is that what Sam would do?

2686
02:05:37,863 --> 02:05:42,259
MATT: Scanlan is then going to cast Invisibility
on himself

2687
02:05:42,259 --> 02:05:46,119
as an immediate self-sustaining reaction.

2688
02:05:46,119 --> 02:05:47,749
LIAM: Oh shit, the music! The music!

2689
02:05:47,749 --> 02:05:49,185
MATT: That brings us to Vex!

2690
02:05:49,185 --> 02:05:51,086
LAURA: Me?

2691
02:05:51,086 --> 02:05:52,029
MATT: Yes.

2692
02:05:52,029 --> 02:05:53,154
LIAM: Ranged attack, ranged attack.

2693
02:05:53,154 --> 02:05:54,077
LAURA: Okay, on the thingie?

2694
02:05:54,077 --> 02:05:55,088
MARISHA: Pew pew.

2695
02:05:55,088 --> 02:05:56,261
ORION: Take out the ogre first.

2696
02:05:56,261 --> 02:06:00,941
LAURA: Okay. Well I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the
black ooze!

2697
02:06:01,146 --> 02:06:02,705
MATT: Okay.

2698
02:06:02,705 --> 02:06:03,724
LIAM: Sounds good.

2699
02:06:03,724 --> 02:06:05,704
LAURA: Okay. Which--

2700
02:06:05,704 --> 02:06:06,951
MATT: So you Lightning Arrow.

2701
02:06:06,951 --> 02:06:09,686
LAURA: Yes, I do.

2702
02:06:09,686 --> 02:06:11,157
Okay.

2703
02:06:11,241 --> 02:06:15,601
Oh, and, oh, the other-- never mind, that
other guy's still Hunter's Marked. Okay.

2704
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:16,627
MARISHA: Well, yeah.

2705
02:06:16,627 --> 02:06:20,924
LIAM: Hit it, hit it, hit it.

2706
02:06:20,924 --> 02:06:22,133
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

2707
02:06:22,133 --> 02:06:22,960
LIAM: Yes, it is!

2708
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,082
LAURA: That's a 19 plus-- that's a regular attack
bonus, right?

2709
02:06:25,082 --> 02:06:26,120
LIAM: It's a crit.

2710
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,621
LAURA: Was it?

2711
02:06:27,621 --> 02:06:29,104
LIAM: Isn't 19-20 crit? That's just for me.

2712
02:06:29,104 --> 02:06:30,021
MATT: No, that's just for you.

2713
02:06:30,021 --> 02:06:31,090
LAURA: That's just for you, yo.

2714
02:06:31,090 --> 02:06:31,880
MATT: Yeah, so that hits.

2715
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:33,120
LAURA: Okay. So.

2716
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:34,118
MARISHA: What if it's like a sentient alien
lifeform?

2717
02:06:34,118 --> 02:06:35,391
ASHLEY: This music is so stressful!

2718
02:06:35,391 --> 02:06:36,650
LAURA: Okay, 4d8 of lightning damage.

2719
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:37,594
MARISHA: You know, like some Spiderman shit.

2720
02:06:37,594 --> 02:06:38,837
MATT: Go ahead and roll the arrow damage.

2721
02:06:38,837 --> 02:06:40,177
MARISHA: Some alien lifeform shit.

2722
02:06:40,177 --> 02:06:41,052
TALIESIN: Well, we should kill it.

2723
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,060
LAURA: Oh, okay.

2724
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:43,061
MARISHA: Yeah.

2725
02:06:43,061 --> 02:06:47,016
LAURA: Just kidding, I'm just so excited! 11.

2726
02:06:47,016 --> 02:06:48,220
MATT: Okay.

2727
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:53,902
LAURA: Okay. And the 4d8 of lightning damage.

2728
02:06:53,902 --> 02:06:55,655
MATT: As the arrow disappears into its form--

2729
02:06:55,655 --> 02:06:56,813
LAURA: No.

2730
02:06:56,813 --> 02:06:59,927
MATT: -- the bolt of energy, as you pull out the
arrow and release it, it sparks and you can see

2731
02:06:59,927 --> 02:07:04,973
the blue energy kind of streaking behind the
arrow. It plunges into this thick, black, gooey

2732
02:07:04,973 --> 02:07:08,314
mass and as it does, the lightning just gets
absorbed into its form.

2733
02:07:08,314 --> 02:07:09,655
TRAVIS: Oh, shit balls.

2734
02:07:09,655 --> 02:07:14,201
MATT: It sits for a second, shakes and quivers,
and then splits.

2735
02:07:14,201 --> 02:07:15,211
MARISHA: Oh! No.

2736
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:16,824
LAURA: Splits?

2737
02:07:16,824 --> 02:07:18,409
LIAM: Yeah, it splits into smaller ones. Smaller
sizes.

2738
02:07:18,409 --> 02:07:22,208
MATT: Dividing into two separate smaller slimes.

2739
02:07:22,208 --> 02:07:23,387
TALIESIN: No!

2740
02:07:23,387 --> 02:07:24,508
LAURA: What is this thing?

2741
02:07:24,508 --> 02:07:28,899
MATT: Seemingly unaffected by the damage of the
lightning. Other than the fact that you altered

2742
02:07:28,899 --> 02:07:30,424
its form slightly.

2743
02:07:30,424 --> 02:07:32,329
LAURA: Great. Cool. Awesome.

2744
02:07:32,329 --> 02:07:34,558
MATT: So, do you wish to move?

2745
02:07:34,558 --> 02:07:42,408
LAURA: Oh, yeah! I back the eff up. Actually,
should-- yeah, yeah. I'm gonna back up.

2746
02:07:42,408 --> 02:07:47,034
To there sounds good.

2747
02:07:47,034 --> 02:07:48,668
MATT: All right!

2748
02:07:48,668 --> 02:07:51,176
That brings us to-- Vax, you're up.

2749
02:07:51,176 --> 02:07:57,446
LIAM: All right, I'm gonna run up to the back of
Tall and Ugly, and try to stab him. I'm gonna do

2750
02:07:57,446 --> 02:07:59,915
the reach-around again, and try to stab him in the
eyes.

2751
02:07:59,915 --> 02:08:01,707
ORION and ASHLEY: The ol' reach-around.

2752
02:08:01,707 --> 02:08:04,682
LIAM: And I'm hidden-- I'm stealth already, I
think, right?

2753
02:08:04,682 --> 02:08:05,607
ORION: Courteous!

2754
02:08:05,607 --> 02:08:06,589
MATT: You are, yes.

2755
02:08:06,589 --> 02:08:07,629
TRAVIS: It's like his character move.

2756
02:08:07,629 --> 02:08:08,473
TALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.

2757
02:08:08,473 --> 02:08:09,629
TRAVIS: Action figure Vax'ahlia.

2758
02:08:09,629 --> 02:08:11,083
LIAM: So the first attack is an 18.

2759
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:12,285
TALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.

2760
02:08:12,285 --> 02:08:13,193
LAURA: That's Vax'ildan.

2761
02:08:13,193 --> 02:08:14,128
MATT: Hits.

2762
02:08:14,128 --> 02:08:15,148
TRAVIS: Sorry. Vax'ildan.

2763
02:08:15,148 --> 02:08:16,194
LIAM: Okay, Sneak Attack, here we go.

2764
02:08:16,194 --> 02:08:17,428
TRAVIS: The signature reach-around move!

2765
02:08:17,428 --> 02:08:28,208
LIAM: For the eyeballs. Two plus seven is--

2766
02:08:28,208 --> 02:08:30,728
LAURA: I'm sorry I let the ooze loose.

2767
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:31,875
TALIESIN: It's okay.

2768
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:33,683
LIAM: 40. 52.

2769
02:08:33,683 --> 02:08:39,535
MATT: 52. As you reach behind, the daggers plunge
into it, and the ogre lumbering over doesn't have

2770
02:08:39,535 --> 02:08:45,249
any more to its life. Its jaw just goes slack as
it releases the last bit of air in its lungs,

2771
02:08:45,249 --> 02:08:48,191
tumbling forward, piling onto his friend.

2772
02:08:48,191 --> 02:08:52,520
LIAM: As it does, I want to use my bonus action to
spring off his shoulders towards my friends.

2773
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,815
MATT: Okay. Okay.

2774
02:08:54,815 --> 02:08:56,246
LAURA: That's good.

2775
02:08:56,246 --> 02:08:58,578
MATT: This direction? All right, go ahead and make
an acrobatics check.

2776
02:08:58,578 --> 02:08:59,502
LIAM: Sure.

2777
02:08:59,502 --> 02:09:00,718
LAURA: Over the lava pit.

2778
02:09:00,718 --> 02:09:01,599
TRAVIS: Kill it.

2779
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:02,863
LAURA: Don't fall in the lava pit.

2780
02:09:02,863 --> 02:09:04,467
LIAM: That's a 15.

2781
02:09:04,467 --> 02:09:08,795
MATT: 15, okay. You barely manage to catch your
footing. Thank god you didn't roll a one. That

2782
02:09:08,795 --> 02:09:13,666
would've been very bad. This ogre then plummets to
the ground, now piling on top of his friend.

2783
02:09:13,666 --> 02:09:15,687
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

2784
02:09:15,687 --> 02:09:19,266
MATT: So now that whole section there is
considered rough terrain.

2785
02:09:19,266 --> 02:09:23,262
All right, that brings us to Percy!

2786
02:09:23,262 --> 02:09:25,421
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try something weird,
here.

2787
02:09:25,421 --> 02:09:26,572
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2788
02:09:26,572 --> 02:09:32,682
TALIESIN: Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step
forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of

2789
02:09:32,682 --> 02:09:38,585
joining this little-- like getting right in here.
And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna

2790
02:09:38,585 --> 02:09:41,599
sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to--
Actually, back me up to about there.

2791
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:42,827
MATT: There?

2792
02:09:42,827 --> 02:09:47,180
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and shoot about right
here, I'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send

2793
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:53,543
the lava-- to see if I can get it to start flowing
towards. Does that make sense?

2794
02:09:53,543 --> 02:09:58,658
MATT: I will tell you, the pool of lava right
there isn't brimming really close to the surface.

2795
02:09:58,658 --> 02:10:00,123
TALIESIN: Oh, it's just down?

2796
02:10:00,355 --> 02:10:02,780
MATT: It would take a significant impact to carve
anything that would release it.

2797
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:03,562
TALIESIN: Okay, well--

2798
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:04,413
MATT: It's self-contained.

2799
02:10:04,413 --> 02:10:06,325
TALIESIN: -- I've come forward enough, I'm gonna
take a shot at one of these guys, then.

2800
02:10:06,325 --> 02:10:08,509
MATT: Okay. This one, or this one?

2801
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:09,470
TALIESIN: That one.

2802
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:11,099
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack--

2803
02:10:11,099 --> 02:10:13,395
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try something else. I'm gonna
try an ice shot.

2804
02:10:13,395 --> 02:10:19,539
MATT: Ice shot. Okay.

2805
02:10:19,539 --> 02:10:20,914
TALIESIN: 15?

2806
02:10:20,914 --> 02:10:21,830
MATT: 15?

2807
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:22,790
LIAM: (sneezes dramatically)

2808
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:23,851
LAURA: Bless you.

2809
02:10:23,851 --> 02:10:25,013
MATT: 15 hits!

2810
02:10:25,013 --> 02:10:27,497
TALIESIN: Oh my god. All right, and that's a--

2811
02:10:27,497 --> 02:10:28,509
TRAVIS: 15 hits.

2812
02:10:28,509 --> 02:10:29,308
LAURA: 15 hits.

2813
02:10:29,308 --> 02:10:31,419
TRAVIS: Let's just take it.

2814
02:10:31,419 --> 02:10:34,592
LAURA: Well, what else are we gonna do with it?

2815
02:10:34,592 --> 02:10:39,621
TALIESIN: -- that's 15 points of damage, plus six
points of ice damage.

2816
02:10:39,621 --> 02:10:45,893
MATT: Okay. The bullet pierces his form. You can
see a part of its gelatinous, physical structure

2817
02:10:45,893 --> 02:10:51,222
quiver. The ice explosion, you see go off, and
just get absorbed into the gelatinous form.

2818
02:10:51,222 --> 02:10:52,144
MARISHA: Fuck.

2819
02:10:52,144 --> 02:10:53,234
TALIESIN: Fuck!

2820
02:10:53,234 --> 02:10:58,006
MATT: Seemingly unaffected by the additional
damage. That's your first shot.

2821
02:10:58,006 --> 02:10:59,044
You get two shots, don't you?

2822
02:10:59,044 --> 02:11:01,621
TALIESIN: That's right. Oh, good god.

2823
02:11:01,621 --> 02:11:04,981
MARISHA: But it didn't split, right?

2824
02:11:04,981 --> 02:11:06,702
MATT and ORION: Nope.

2825
02:11:06,702 --> 02:11:10,122
MARISHA: That's cool. It's a perk.

2826
02:11:10,122 --> 02:11:17,970
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's-- Okay. I'm going to
attempt to-- Is there any loose-looking rocks that

2827
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:21,803
are up above? Or is there anything that looks
like, if I gave it a push,

2828
02:11:21,803 --> 02:11:23,391
would fall down, from up above?

2829
02:11:23,391 --> 02:11:28,147
MATT: This tunnel looks pretty, at this point,
pretty cleanly carved out.

2830
02:11:28,147 --> 02:11:30,777
LAURA: What about the areas I exploded?

2831
02:11:30,777 --> 02:11:33,265
MATT: Over there? I mean, there's parts of the
rock, but the explosion was more damaging to

2832
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:34,578
things that were fragile--

2833
02:11:34,578 --> 02:11:35,781
LAURA: Okay, okay.

2834
02:11:35,781 --> 02:11:36,989
MATT: -- the stonework is pretty solid.

2835
02:11:36,989 --> 02:11:38,232
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take another shot at the same
one and see what happens.

2836
02:11:38,232 --> 02:11:40,688
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2837
02:11:40,688 --> 02:11:42,136
TALIESIN: 20, that hits.

2838
02:11:42,136 --> 02:11:45,273
MATT: Yep! Damage.

2839
02:11:45,273 --> 02:11:48,572
TALIESIN: Not a lot. That's seven points of
damage.

2840
02:11:48,572 --> 02:11:52,600
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. Both shots into it. You see
its form kind of quiver at the impact, but it's

2841
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:57,891
still slowly slithering forward. Now comes to
Keyleth!

2842
02:11:57,891 --> 02:12:07,457
MARISHA: Okay. I wanna move, kind of be like,
whoops, sorry, 'scuse me, pardon me, and come like

2843
02:12:07,457 --> 02:12:15,295
heresies. Would you say that I'm 30 feet away from
that guy?

2844
02:12:15,295 --> 02:12:20,204
MATT: Just barely. Like, he's just in the cusp of
30 feet from you.

2845
02:12:20,204 --> 02:12:23,973
MARISHA: Will my Thorn Whip reach him? My
30-foot-range Thorn Whip?

2846
02:12:23,973 --> 02:12:25,771
MATT: You can certainly try!

2847
02:12:25,771 --> 02:12:26,915
MARISHA: I'm gonna try and Thorn Whip him!

2848
02:12:26,915 --> 02:12:27,873
MATT: Okay!

2849
02:12:27,873 --> 02:12:28,970
LIAM: (Cosby voice) You see, the black goo
thing--

2850
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:30,128
MATT: What's the Thorn Whip do?

2851
02:12:30,128 --> 02:12:31,174
LIAM: -- is not so easy to kill.

2852
02:12:31,174 --> 02:12:32,615
(all laugh)

2853
02:12:32,615 --> 02:12:33,458
MARISHA: Huh?

2854
02:12:33,458 --> 02:12:35,209
MATT: What's the Thorn Whip do? Read the spell for
me.

2855
02:12:35,209 --> 02:12:36,170
ASHLEY: Too soon?

2856
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:37,251
LAURA: Too soon?

2857
02:12:37,251 --> 02:12:48,194
MARISHA: Well, it does 2d6 damage, it's a 30-foot
range, and it pulls 10 feet. Notes I have on it--

2858
02:12:48,194 --> 02:12:52,892
Okay-- piercing damage-- if they are large or
smaller,

2859
02:12:52,892 --> 02:12:55,342
you pull the creature up to ten feet closer.

2860
02:12:55,342 --> 02:13:00,406
MATT: What type of damage is it?

2861
02:13:00,406 --> 02:13:01,311
MARISHA: Piercing.

2862
02:13:01,311 --> 02:13:04,346
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. All right. So, you hit, go
ahead and roll damage.

2863
02:13:04,346 --> 02:13:08,914
MARISHA: I hit. I don't hit. That's funny. Okay.

2864
02:13:08,914 --> 02:13:10,466
MATT: You rolled a 20, right?

2865
02:13:10,466 --> 02:13:11,383
MARISHA: I didn't roll yet.

2866
02:13:11,383 --> 02:13:12,179
MATT: Oh, you didn't roll yet. Sorry.

2867
02:13:12,179 --> 02:13:12,988
MARISHA: No.

2868
02:13:12,988 --> 02:13:13,912
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to hit.

2869
02:13:13,912 --> 02:13:14,679
MARISHA: What do I add, my spell modifier?

2870
02:13:14,679 --> 02:13:15,384
MATT: Yep.

2871
02:13:15,384 --> 02:13:16,031
MARISHA: 18.

2872
02:13:16,031 --> 02:13:16,758
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

2873
02:13:16,758 --> 02:13:17,387
LAURA: Woo!

2874
02:13:17,387 --> 02:13:17,983
ASHLEY: Woo!

2875
02:13:17,983 --> 02:13:18,677
MATT: So, go ahead and roll damage.

2876
02:13:18,677 --> 02:13:19,569
MARISHA: 19, sorry, it's actually 19.

2877
02:13:19,569 --> 02:13:23,053
MATT: That still hits! It doesn't move very fast,
it's a little easy to hit.

2878
02:13:23,053 --> 02:13:25,027
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

2879
02:13:25,027 --> 02:13:25,829
MATT: All right, takes its damage.

2880
02:13:25,829 --> 02:13:31,391
MARISHA: One piercing damage, but I pull him ten
feet closer to me. Does he go into the lava?

2881
02:13:31,391 --> 02:13:36,059
MATT: Gets pushed just ever so slightly into the
hole. As it does, you can see this blackish steam

2882
02:13:36,059 --> 02:13:39,252
and smoke begin to billow up from where it hits,
and it (growls).

2883
02:13:39,252 --> 02:13:40,043
LAURA: Good!

2884
02:13:40,043 --> 02:13:42,043
MATT: -- begins to quiver as you're kind of
yanking it back with the Thorn Whip.

2885
02:13:42,043 --> 02:13:43,062
LIAM: What was that sound it made again?

2886
02:13:43,062 --> 02:13:44,394
MATT: (growls)

2887
02:13:44,394 --> 02:13:45,937
(all laugh)

2888
02:13:45,937 --> 02:13:48,996
MATT: It takes 2d10 points of damage--

2889
02:13:48,996 --> 02:13:49,997
LAURA: Woo!

2890
02:13:49,997 --> 02:13:54,864
MATT: -- from the impact of the lava. That's an
additional 17 points of fire damage to it.

2891
02:13:54,864 --> 02:13:55,686
TALIESIN: That's nice.

2892
02:13:55,686 --> 02:13:56,513
LIAM: Yes!

2893
02:13:56,513 --> 02:13:57,344
LAURA: Fire damage!

2894
02:13:57,344 --> 02:13:58,061
ASHLEY: Nice!

2895
02:13:58,061 --> 02:13:58,897
LIAM: Aw, yes!

2896
02:13:58,897 --> 02:13:59,769
LAURA: Kill it with fire!

2897
02:13:59,769 --> 02:14:00,994
MARISHA: And I've got him on a leash now.

2898
02:14:00,994 --> 02:14:01,781
LIAM: Burn it!

2899
02:14:01,781 --> 02:14:03,133
MATT: You do. Is it considered grappled?

2900
02:14:03,133 --> 02:14:04,393
MARISHA: Nope.

2901
02:14:04,393 --> 02:14:06,304
MATT: Then that would be the end of the attack.
The spell dissipates after that.

2902
02:14:06,304 --> 02:14:07,323
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

2903
02:14:07,323 --> 02:14:08,372
MATT: You've gotta do it again the next turn.

2904
02:14:08,372 --> 02:14:08,974
MARISHA: Okay.

2905
02:14:08,974 --> 02:14:09,586
LIAM: Hey, that was pretty good.

2906
02:14:09,586 --> 02:14:10,322
LAURA: Yep.

2907
02:14:10,322 --> 02:14:11,537
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Pike, you're
up!

2908
02:14:11,537 --> 02:14:17,885
ASHLEY: Okay. So, question. I want to use
something I think that I can use called-- this may

2909
02:14:17,885 --> 02:14:20,192
be stupid, so I have another option if this is
dumb.

2910
02:14:20,192 --> 02:14:21,035
TRAVIS: That's what it's called?

2911
02:14:21,035 --> 02:14:21,941
LAURA: (laughs)

2912
02:14:21,941 --> 02:14:22,654
ASHLEY: Yes.

2913
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:23,375
ORION: That's a weird spell!

2914
02:14:23,375 --> 02:14:24,083
LIAM: So long!

2915
02:14:24,083 --> 02:14:25,125
ASHLEY: Something called 'Insect Plague'.

2916
02:14:25,125 --> 02:14:25,762
MATT: Okay.

2917
02:14:25,762 --> 02:14:26,789
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah!

2918
02:14:26,789 --> 02:14:32,619
ASHLEY: Which you can use as a ranged attack in a
20-foot-radius sphere?

2919
02:14:32,619 --> 02:14:35,285
MATT: Yes. So, you do it at range, and it creates
a 20-foot radius that does this.

2920
02:14:35,285 --> 02:14:44,480
ASHLEY: Okay, and then it's a 1d10-- creature
takes 4d10 piercing damage-- oh, on a failed save,

2921
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,331
or half as much damage on a successful one.

2922
02:14:46,331 --> 02:14:47,140
LAURA: Okay.

2923
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,136
MATT: Cool! So there's that, yeah.

2924
02:14:48,136 --> 02:14:49,398
LIAM: Very Old Testament!

2925
02:14:49,398 --> 02:14:50,027
ASHLEY: So, I think--

2926
02:14:50,027 --> 02:14:50,705
MATT: Do you wanna move--

2927
02:14:50,705 --> 02:14:51,497
LAURA: Yeah, do it!

2928
02:14:51,497 --> 02:14:52,466
ASHLEY: Okay, you know, let's give it a try!

2929
02:14:52,466 --> 02:14:53,669
LAURA: And then we can see what it does to
creatures within its zone!

2930
02:14:53,669 --> 02:14:54,614
MATT: Where do you wanna go, girl?

2931
02:14:54,614 --> 02:14:55,587
ASHLEY: Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't
see.

2932
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:57,862
MATT: You're right over here. It's your gold
base.

2933
02:14:57,862 --> 02:14:59,389
ASHLEY: So, where do I need to be to do it-- like
over here?

2934
02:14:59,389 --> 02:15:00,908
LIAM: Get closer.

2935
02:15:00,908 --> 02:15:02,708
LAURA: Maybe up next to the ogre dead.

2936
02:15:02,708 --> 02:15:03,715
LIAM: Gotta run up.

2937
02:15:03,715 --> 02:15:05,743
MATT: Okay. One, two, three, four. That's about as
close as you can get there, yeah.

2938
02:15:05,743 --> 02:15:07,769
ASHLEY: Okay. So can I still get it there?

2939
02:15:07,769 --> 02:15:11,370
MATT: Yeah, you can cast it. Where do you want to
put the radius?

2940
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:13,124
ASHLEY: Are these all five?

2941
02:15:13,124 --> 02:15:14,136
ORION: Yeah.

2942
02:15:14,136 --> 02:15:15,405
MATT: These are all five-foot squares.

2943
02:15:15,405 --> 02:15:16,206
ASHLEY: Okay, so can I--

2944
02:15:16,206 --> 02:15:18,858
LIAM: I'd just like to point out, this is like the
Avengers trailer, where all the heroes run out and

2945
02:15:18,858 --> 02:15:20,112
jump at the same time.

2946
02:15:20,112 --> 02:15:21,092
(all laugh)

2947
02:15:21,092 --> 02:15:21,858
LAURA: Yeah.

2948
02:15:21,858 --> 02:15:23,139
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, you can get these both from
there.

2949
02:15:23,139 --> 02:15:24,505
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll try to get them both.

2950
02:15:24,505 --> 02:15:25,536
MATT: Okay, all right, so--

2951
02:15:25,536 --> 02:15:26,514
ASHLEY: So then ten.

2952
02:15:26,514 --> 02:15:27,932
MATT: So you go ahead and roll the damage.

2953
02:15:27,932 --> 02:15:30,326
ASHLEY: Okay, so how-- Wait, how many do I roll,
again? At fifth level?

2954
02:15:30,326 --> 02:15:32,792
MATT: You're casting this as a fifth-level spell?

2955
02:15:32,792 --> 02:15:34,038
ASHLEY: Well, maybe I shouldn't--

2956
02:15:34,038 --> 02:15:34,798
MATT: It's up to you.

2957
02:15:34,798 --> 02:15:35,364
LAURA: Yeah, do it.

2958
02:15:35,364 --> 02:15:36,040
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll do it.

2959
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:37,023
LIAM: Do it, do it, try it.

2960
02:15:37,023 --> 02:15:38,486
ASHLEY: But do I save a healing?

2961
02:15:38,486 --> 02:15:39,321
LIAM: Do it.

2962
02:15:39,321 --> 02:15:39,935
LAURA: Go for it, Pike.

2963
02:15:39,935 --> 02:15:40,891
LIAM: Come on, you're a warrior.

2964
02:15:40,891 --> 02:15:41,857
MATT: It's up to you, Pike. You do what you gotta
do.

2965
02:15:41,857 --> 02:15:46,768
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- Cool, one.

2966
02:15:46,768 --> 02:15:47,449
LAURA: Ten.

2967
02:15:47,449 --> 02:15:48,262
LIAM: Ten.

2968
02:15:48,262 --> 02:15:48,922
ASHLEY: Ten, 11.

2969
02:15:48,922 --> 02:15:49,851
LAURA: 18.

2970
02:15:49,851 --> 02:15:50,933
ASHLEY: 19.

2971
02:15:50,933 --> 02:15:51,700
MATT: Okay.

2972
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:52,823
ASHLEY: So how many do I roll? That was three--

2973
02:15:52,823 --> 02:15:54,537
MATT: It gets to make a saving throw to see if it
gets half damage.

2974
02:15:54,537 --> 02:15:55,987
ASHLEY: So I roll another one then--

2975
02:15:55,987 --> 02:15:57,037
LAURA: Yeah, four. She gets four.

2976
02:15:57,037 --> 02:15:57,677
MATT: What's--

2977
02:15:57,677 --> 02:16:00,332
ASHLEY: I roll, I roll four. Hold on. 19.

2978
02:16:00,332 --> 02:16:01,006
LAURA: 25.

2979
02:16:01,006 --> 02:16:01,761
LIAM: 25.

2980
02:16:01,761 --> 02:16:02,483
ASHLEY: 25.

2981
02:16:02,483 --> 02:16:04,484
MATT: Okay, what's the DC? What's your spell DC at
the top of your spell sheet?

2982
02:16:04,484 --> 02:16:06,713
ASHLEY: Eight plus-- Or-- No, sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry.

2983
02:16:06,713 --> 02:16:07,509
MATT: DC should be--

2984
02:16:07,509 --> 02:16:08,414
ASHLEY: 16.

2985
02:16:08,414 --> 02:16:09,252
LIAM: That's better.

2986
02:16:09,252 --> 02:16:10,368
MATT: 16, okay, one makes its save, the other
doesn't.

2987
02:16:10,368 --> 02:16:11,198
ASHLEY: Okay.

2988
02:16:11,198 --> 02:16:12,439
MATT: So what's the total damage?

2989
02:16:12,439 --> 02:16:13,146
LAURA: 25.

2990
02:16:13,146 --> 02:16:13,875
ASHLEY: 25.

2991
02:16:13,875 --> 02:16:16,418
MATT: Okay, so one takes 25, one takes 13.

2992
02:16:16,418 --> 02:16:17,199
ORION: Cool.

2993
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:18,121
TALIESIN: Wow.

2994
02:16:18,121 --> 02:16:24,235
MATT: Piercing damage. Got it. And, just, insects
appear in the area, doing that much damage. Does

2995
02:16:24,235 --> 02:16:26,510
that stay? Or does that go away at the end of your
turn?

2996
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:28,778
ASHLEY: Let's see here.

2997
02:16:28,778 --> 02:16:30,491
MATT: What's the duration?

2998
02:16:30,491 --> 02:16:32,090
ASHLEY: Concentration. Up to ten minutes.

2999
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:33,142
MATT: So you can keep it there if you want to.

3000
02:16:33,142 --> 02:16:33,717
LAURA: Ooh.

3001
02:16:33,717 --> 02:16:34,555
ASHLEY: I'll just keep it.

3002
02:16:34,555 --> 02:16:36,104
MATT: It just does damage every turn to everything
in that radius.

3003
02:16:36,104 --> 02:16:36,924
ASHLEY: Awesome, let's just keep it.

3004
02:16:36,924 --> 02:16:38,055
MATT: Okay.

3005
02:16:38,055 --> 02:16:39,916
ASHLEY: I'm just really concentrating.

3006
02:16:39,916 --> 02:16:41,997
MATT: That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

3007
02:16:41,997 --> 02:16:49,485
TRAVIS: Right, I would like to pull the flaming
hammer out of the bag of holding.

3008
02:16:49,485 --> 02:16:50,700
LAURA: Yeah.

3009
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:55,538
TRAVIS: And I would like to run at the-- this
little-- this guy.

3010
02:16:55,538 --> 02:16:57,474
ORION: No, you'll get in the insect cloud.

3011
02:16:57,474 --> 02:16:58,263
TRAVIS: What?

3012
02:16:58,263 --> 02:16:59,497
ORION: You'll get in the insect cloud.

3013
02:16:59,497 --> 02:17:00,481
MATT: All right. One, two, three, four.

3014
02:17:00,481 --> 02:17:03,068
LAURA: Stay away from the insect cloud.

3015
02:17:03,068 --> 02:17:04,578
TRAVIS: I forgot there was an insect cloud.

3016
02:17:04,578 --> 02:17:07,500
MATT: Five, six, seven, eight. That's as far as
you can get, currently.

3017
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,446
TRAVIS: Oh, because there are bodies in the way?

3018
02:17:08,446 --> 02:17:09,992
MATT: Because of the rough terrain, and you have
to jump over the bodies to get there.

3019
02:17:09,992 --> 02:17:11,117
LAURA: Wait, but my natural ability--

3020
02:17:11,117 --> 02:17:14,750
TRAVIS: Then if that's as far as I can get, I
would like to take the hooded lantern I have out

3021
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:16,541
of the bag of holding and throw it--

3022
02:17:16,541 --> 02:17:19,930
LAURA: Difficult terrain does not slow my group's
travel when this is my favored terrain.

3023
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:20,785
MARISHA: Ooh!

3024
02:17:20,785 --> 02:17:24,066
(all cheer)

3025
02:17:24,066 --> 02:17:27,262
TRAVIS: Yes!

3026
02:17:27,262 --> 02:17:29,985
MATT: Nice one. Boom, boom, boom. So you just go
charging up overtop the ogre bodies, leaping,

3027
02:17:29,985 --> 02:17:32,475
coming down with the-- hammer, you said?

3028
02:17:32,475 --> 02:17:33,667
TRAVIS: Yes, with the flaming hammer.

3029
02:17:33,667 --> 02:17:34,722
LIAM: Oh man, you the real MVP.

3030
02:17:34,722 --> 02:17:37,643
TRAVIS: -- activating the flaming properties of
rage, and urine, and death.

3031
02:17:37,735 --> 02:17:38,871
MATT: Okay.

3032
02:17:38,871 --> 02:17:39,944
TALIESIN: Flame on.

3033
02:17:39,944 --> 02:17:41,143
(all laugh)

3034
02:17:41,143 --> 02:17:42,214
ORION: Rage, urine, and death.

3035
02:17:42,214 --> 02:17:42,897
LIAM: Wow.

3036
02:17:42,897 --> 02:17:44,101
LAURA: Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch
you.

3037
02:17:44,101 --> 02:17:44,834
TRAVIS: We'll see.

3038
02:17:44,834 --> 02:17:45,716
ASHLEY: Don't let it touch you.

3039
02:17:45,716 --> 02:17:46,723
LIAM: Work those rules.

3040
02:17:46,723 --> 02:17:49,587
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for attack.
You have three attacks with this, at--

3041
02:17:49,587 --> 02:17:50,813
MARISHA: Rage, urine, and death.

3042
02:17:50,813 --> 02:17:51,882
MATT: Are you frenzying or regular rage?

3043
02:17:51,882 --> 02:17:53,383
TRAVIS: Raging, raging, rage. Just regular rage.

3044
02:17:53,383 --> 02:17:54,409
MATT: Okay, so you get two attacks.

3045
02:17:54,409 --> 02:17:55,406
TRAVIS: Yeah. 19.

3046
02:17:55,406 --> 02:17:57,591
MATT: 19 hits.

3047
02:17:57,591 --> 02:17:59,644
TRAVIS: And 12.

3048
02:17:59,644 --> 02:18:01,348
MATT: 12 also hits.

3049
02:18:01,348 --> 02:18:02,348
(all cheer)

3050
02:18:02,348 --> 02:18:04,221
TRAVIS: Awesome. And this is a 1d--

3051
02:18:04,221 --> 02:18:07,839
MATT: And damage, are you using it two-handed?

3052
02:18:07,839 --> 02:18:08,868
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3053
02:18:08,868 --> 02:18:10,078
MATT: 1d10 damage.

3054
02:18:10,078 --> 02:18:10,821
TRAVIS: 1d10.

3055
02:18:10,821 --> 02:18:15,619
MATT: Plus whatever the fire damage is on the
weapon.

3056
02:18:15,619 --> 02:18:16,994
TRAVIS: That can't be right.

3057
02:18:16,994 --> 02:18:18,679
MATT: What did you roll?

3058
02:18:18,679 --> 02:18:20,361
MARISHA: What? What the dice rolled?

3059
02:18:20,361 --> 02:18:22,459
TRAVIS: 1d10? Is this the right dice?

3060
02:18:22,686 --> 02:18:23,771
TALIESIN: If you rolled zero, you rolled a ten.

3061
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:25,326
LAURA: If it's a zero, it's a ten.

3062
02:18:25,326 --> 02:18:26,020
MARISHA: Yeah.

3063
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:26,837
TRAVIS: It's a 30.

3064
02:18:26,837 --> 02:18:27,622
LAURA: Oh, that's a three. He rolled the--

3065
02:18:27,622 --> 02:18:28,392
MATT: Yeah.

3066
02:18:28,392 --> 02:18:29,600
TRAVIS: I was like, 30!

3067
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:32,481
MATT: So, three plus your proficiency modifier,
which is four.

3068
02:18:32,481 --> 02:18:34,488
TRAVIS: Yeah. Seven.

3069
02:18:34,488 --> 02:18:38,621
MATT: No, this is for damage, so the damage would
be plus your strength modifier.

3070
02:18:38,621 --> 02:18:40,129
TRAVIS: Oh, four.

3071
02:18:40,129 --> 02:18:42,103
MATT: Yeah, so four still. So seven.

3072
02:18:42,103 --> 02:18:43,582
TRAVIS: And plus seven for rage.

3073
02:18:43,582 --> 02:18:45,704
MATT: Plus two for rage.

3074
02:18:45,704 --> 02:18:46,975
TRAVIS: Plus two for rage.

3075
02:18:46,975 --> 02:18:49,732
MATT: Yeah, so whatever the bonus is to your
greataxe--

3076
02:18:49,732 --> 02:18:50,541
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3077
02:18:50,541 --> 02:18:51,544
MATT: What's that?

3078
02:18:51,544 --> 02:18:54,933
TRAVIS: Oh, it's-- to the greataxe is seven when
I'm raging.

3079
02:18:54,933 --> 02:18:57,023
MATT: So then ten points of damage, then roll the
fire damage as well.

3080
02:18:57,023 --> 02:18:58,164
TRAVIS: Okay.

3081
02:18:58,164 --> 02:19:00,107
LIAM: How is he keeping all of this in his mind?
It's like a computer in his brain.

3082
02:19:00,107 --> 02:19:01,738
LAURA: I know.

3083
02:19:01,738 --> 02:19:02,833
TRAVIS: Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10?

3084
02:19:02,899 --> 02:19:05,303
MATT: It should say on the actual magical item.

3085
02:19:05,303 --> 02:19:07,314
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 1d6.

3086
02:19:07,384 --> 02:19:08,792
MATT: So 1d6 additional fire damage.

3087
02:19:08,869 --> 02:19:11,052
TRAVIS: Five.

3088
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,093
MATT: All right, so 15 points of damage total from
the first strike. Go ahead and roll damage from

3089
02:19:14,093 --> 02:19:15,302
the second one.

3090
02:19:15,302 --> 02:19:19,072
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. Seven.

3091
02:19:19,072 --> 02:19:21,156
MATT: So 14, plus an additional 1d6.

3092
02:19:21,156 --> 02:19:23,665
LIAM: Grog, math hard.

3093
02:19:23,665 --> 02:19:26,008
TRAVIS: Three.

3094
02:19:26,008 --> 02:19:31,303
MATT: All right, cool. All right, so as you come
running over, leaping in the air, over the ogre

3095
02:19:31,509 --> 02:19:36,460
bodies, you then slam the hammer once in the side,
the fire catching on the metal, on the black iron

3096
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:38,617
as it streaks through the air, lighting up the
cavern around you.

3097
02:19:38,617 --> 02:19:39,574
LAURA: Yeah!

3098
02:19:39,574 --> 02:19:41,797
MATT: You guys see this, like, red arc, as Grog
comes slamming down into the ooze.

3099
02:19:41,797 --> 02:19:43,136
ORION: Fire hammer!

3100
02:19:43,136 --> 02:19:47,507
MATT: First one, it hits, boom, smacks, the flames
ignite, and the impact, you see it kind of freaks

3101
02:19:47,507 --> 02:19:53,073
out and quivers backwards, screeching sound. As it
does, there's a splash of the black ichor that

3102
02:19:53,073 --> 02:19:54,018
hits your shoulders--

3103
02:19:54,018 --> 02:19:55,276
LAURA: (gasps) No!

3104
02:19:55,276 --> 02:19:57,991
MATT: -- and you feel it burn and bite into your
torso. You take ten points of acid damage.

3105
02:19:57,991 --> 02:19:58,911
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3106
02:19:58,911 --> 02:19:59,585
LAURA: Acid.

3107
02:19:59,585 --> 02:20:00,529
ASHLEY: Acid.

3108
02:20:00,529 --> 02:20:03,364
MATT: You reach back, not even thinking in the
frenzy in your brain, you feel like, just seeing

3109
02:20:03,364 --> 02:20:05,830
blood and red in your eyes, as you slam down your
second strike.

3110
02:20:05,917 --> 02:20:07,238
ASHLEY: Grog is gonna start tripping.

3111
02:20:07,238 --> 02:20:10,764
MATT: You feel the second impact. Once again, you
feel the spray of black across your body. You take

3112
02:20:10,764 --> 02:20:13,204
an additional ten points of acid damage.

3113
02:20:13,330 --> 02:20:14,339
TRAVIS: Up close sucks.

3114
02:20:14,339 --> 02:20:15,253
LIAM: That's nothing for Grog, that's nothing.

3115
02:20:15,253 --> 02:20:16,118
ASHLEY: Nothing, nothing.

3116
02:20:16,118 --> 02:20:17,280
MARISHA: Nothing, he likes it, feels good.

3117
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,473
TRAVIS: I'm pretty low.

3118
02:20:18,473 --> 02:20:19,475
MATT: That ends Grog's turn.

3119
02:20:19,475 --> 02:20:21,309
LAURA: You're low? On health? Have you not healed
at all?

3120
02:20:21,309 --> 02:20:22,598
LIAM: No, we stayed up and kept watch.

3121
02:20:22,598 --> 02:20:23,735
MARISHA: Just helped with that itch you couldn't
scratch.

3122
02:20:23,735 --> 02:20:24,783
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

3123
02:20:24,783 --> 02:20:26,244
TRAVIS: No, I'm fine.

3124
02:20:26,328 --> 02:20:27,855
MATT: On this turn, this one pulls out of the
lava--

3125
02:20:27,855 --> 02:20:28,626
LAURA: No.

3126
02:20:28,626 --> 02:20:32,344
MATT: Takes an additional 2d10 from being in at
the start of its turn. An additional eight damage,

3127
02:20:32,344 --> 02:20:37,771
and moves up, both of them flank over to Grog.

3128
02:20:37,771 --> 02:20:42,167
TRAVIS: Come to me, woodland creatures.

3129
02:20:42,167 --> 02:20:45,897
MATT: Both of them attempting to strike you from
each side. As you're flanked,

3130
02:20:45,897 --> 02:20:50,465
that is a 20 versus armor class.

3131
02:20:50,465 --> 02:20:51,814
TRAVIS: That will hit.

3132
02:20:51,814 --> 02:20:53,289
MATT: And a 21 versus armor class.

3133
02:20:53,289 --> 02:20:55,160
TRAVIS: That'll hit, too.

3134
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:57,046
MARISHA: You're being attacked by jello.

3135
02:20:57,046 --> 02:21:00,228
MATT: All right, both of the creatures, they
(oozing sound) up next to you. These pseudopods

3136
02:21:00,228 --> 02:21:07,320
kind of come billowing out, slamming into you with
the force of an extremely thick, heavy battering

3137
02:21:07,386 --> 02:21:10,850
ram. Both hit you for-- let's see, here--

3138
02:21:10,850 --> 02:21:12,550
TRAVIS: You broke in their glass casket.

3139
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:13,949
MATT: One hits you for 12 points of damage--

3140
02:21:13,949 --> 02:21:14,638
LAURA: Oh.

3141
02:21:14,638 --> 02:21:15,367
TRAVIS: Okay.

3142
02:21:15,367 --> 02:21:16,904
MATT: The other hits you for 14 points of damage.

3143
02:21:16,904 --> 02:21:17,912
TRAVIS: Okay.

3144
02:21:17,912 --> 02:21:20,052
MATT: Remember, you're raging, so that's halved.

3145
02:21:20,052 --> 02:21:21,168
TRAVIS: Oh, halved. Both of those?

3146
02:21:21,168 --> 02:21:21,800
MATT: Yeah.

3147
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,646
TRAVIS: Awesome.

3148
02:21:22,646 --> 02:21:24,925
LIAM: Tank.

3149
02:21:24,925 --> 02:21:25,966
ASHLEY: He still has more than me.

3150
02:21:25,966 --> 02:21:31,598
MATT: However, both impacts slamming into your
body, the leftover sludge begins to eat away and

3151
02:21:31,598 --> 02:21:37,182
corrode the flesh upon impact. You take from both
sides-- non-halved, because it is not slashing,

3152
02:21:37,182 --> 02:21:44,330
bludgeoning, or piercing damage-- you take a total
of 56 points of acid damage.

3153
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,151
TALIESIN: What?

3154
02:21:45,151 --> 02:21:46,088
ASHLEY: What?

3155
02:21:46,088 --> 02:21:46,920
LAURA: What?

3156
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,946
MATT: From both slams.

3157
02:21:47,946 --> 02:21:48,762
TRAVIS: That's gross.

3158
02:21:48,762 --> 02:21:49,585
LAURA: (gasps) Grog's unconscious.

3159
02:21:49,585 --> 02:21:50,546
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

3160
02:21:50,546 --> 02:21:51,365
LAURA: You're not?

3161
02:21:51,365 --> 02:21:52,929
LIAM: Double that? Double that, or that?

3162
02:21:52,929 --> 02:21:56,642
MATT: No, from both sides. 28 from each.

3163
02:21:56,642 --> 02:22:00,833
ASHLEY: How many have you got?

3164
02:22:00,833 --> 02:22:02,855
TRAVIS: 14.

3165
02:22:02,855 --> 02:22:03,458
LAURA: Oh my god.

3166
02:22:03,458 --> 02:22:05,591
TRAVIS: Okay, so little piles of shit have got
huevos.

3167
02:22:05,591 --> 02:22:06,428
ASHLEY: Wait, and I can't--

3168
02:22:06,428 --> 02:22:07,509
MATT: Clarota moves from here, up to here.

3169
02:22:07,509 --> 02:22:08,815
LAURA: Clarota, save us!

3170
02:22:08,815 --> 02:22:11,196
MARISHA: Really bad jello. It's, like, fridge
experiment jello.

3171
02:22:11,196 --> 02:22:12,374
TALIESIN: Coffee jello.

3172
02:22:12,374 --> 02:22:13,361
MARISHA: Coffee jello?

3173
02:22:13,361 --> 02:22:14,773
ASHLEY: Grog!

3174
02:22:14,773 --> 02:22:17,768
TRAVIS: That's me, all smart with the fire
hammer.

3175
02:22:17,768 --> 02:22:19,228
MATT: Hey, it did damage, didn't it?

3176
02:22:19,228 --> 02:22:20,673
TRAVIS: It certainly did something.

3177
02:22:20,673 --> 02:22:22,429
MATT: It certainly did something

3178
02:22:22,429 --> 02:22:30,176
Clarota is going to move forward and is
going to attempt a-- It's kind of close-- He is

3179
02:22:30,264 --> 02:22:33,212
going to attempt a Lightning Bolt against this guy
here.

3180
02:22:33,212 --> 02:22:34,619
MARISHA: No.

3181
02:22:34,619 --> 02:22:38,697
LAURA: Don't do a Lightning Bolt! What? Why would
Clarota use a Lightning Bolt when he saw that the

3182
02:22:38,697 --> 02:22:40,543
lightning did not work for me?

3183
02:22:40,543 --> 02:22:42,831
MATT: Clarota did not see.

3184
02:22:42,831 --> 02:22:43,707
LAURA: Ugh.

3185
02:22:43,707 --> 02:22:45,207
MARISHA: Clarota didn't see? Where was Clarota?

3186
02:22:45,207 --> 02:22:46,362
MATT: Way back here.

3187
02:22:46,362 --> 02:22:47,545
LIAM: He has to look. He was hanging back.

3188
02:22:47,545 --> 02:22:48,790
LAURA: Clarota is trying to screw with us.

3189
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:50,216
MARISHA: Why was he trailing? What the fuck?

3190
02:22:50,216 --> 02:22:51,127
LIAM: Nah, he was hanging back.

3191
02:22:51,127 --> 02:22:52,040
MARISHA: He's a slacker.

3192
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:52,916
LIAM: He's weak.

3193
02:22:52,916 --> 02:22:53,796
MARISHA: He's a fucking slacker.

3194
02:22:53,796 --> 02:22:54,710
ORION: That's right, he's weak.

3195
02:22:54,710 --> 02:22:56,598
LIAM: He's got this, but he doesn't have this.
He's weak, he's hanging back.

3196
02:22:56,598 --> 02:22:57,503
MARISHA: All right.

3197
02:22:57,503 --> 02:22:58,818
LIAM: What is the deal with the mind flayer?

3198
02:22:58,818 --> 02:23:00,802
MATT: I would recommend not arguing with the DM.

3199
02:23:00,802 --> 02:23:01,458
ORION: Right.

3200
02:23:01,458 --> 02:23:02,140
TRAVIS: Yeah, right.

3201
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:04,349
MARISHA: I'm not arguing with the DM, I'm calling
Clarota a slacker.

3202
02:23:04,349 --> 02:23:08,621
MATT: Clarota, as it released the bolt of energy,
it streaks past, through the air. It arcs into the

3203
02:23:08,621 --> 02:23:16,316
side of the entity, which then absorbs it.
Clarota's eyes go wide for a second.

3204
02:23:16,316 --> 02:23:19,373
Nervous, it looks at its hands, and puts
them back underneath its robe. As it does--

3205
02:23:19,373 --> 02:23:20,491
LAURA: Fudge!

3206
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:25,001
MARISHA: Damn it, Clarota.

3207
02:23:25,001 --> 02:23:28,831
MATT: The entity divides once again.

3208
02:23:28,831 --> 02:23:31,574
LAURA: God! Darn it.

3209
02:23:31,574 --> 02:23:32,499
MATT: Into two more--

3210
02:23:32,499 --> 02:23:33,443
LAURA: What is that?

3211
02:23:33,443 --> 02:23:34,345
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3212
02:23:34,345 --> 02:23:35,193
LAURA: What is happening?

3213
02:23:35,193 --> 02:23:35,876
TRAVIS: Balls.

3214
02:23:35,876 --> 02:23:36,785
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

3215
02:23:36,785 --> 02:23:41,264
MATT: That ends its turn. At this point in time,
now the loud ruckus

3216
02:23:41,264 --> 02:23:44,300
has been glaring through this tunnel--

3217
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:45,386
LIAM: Shit.

3218
02:23:45,386 --> 02:23:47,269
MATT: You hear (clicking sound).

3219
02:23:47,269 --> 02:23:48,217
LIAM: Shit.

3220
02:23:48,217 --> 02:23:49,670
TRAVIS: Ah, not an umber hulk.

3221
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:51,102
LAURA: Is it another one of those--

3222
02:23:51,102 --> 02:23:53,874
MATT: A pair of clacking sounds. And you, as soon
as you look up at the ceiling and you see two

3223
02:23:53,874 --> 02:24:02,004
large creatures clinging to the ceiling, scurrying
across with these strange hooked hands, before

3224
02:24:02,070 --> 02:24:05,065
both immediately leap down from the ceiling.

3225
02:24:05,133 --> 02:24:06,242
TRAVIS: We're in big trouble.

3226
02:24:06,242 --> 02:24:07,240
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.

3227
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:07,931
LIAM: Oh, man.

3228
02:24:07,931 --> 02:24:08,992
LAURA: Are you freaking kidding me?

3229
02:24:08,992 --> 02:24:10,460
MARISHA: What are those? What is that?

3230
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:12,178
LAURA: He's trying to kill us.

3231
02:24:12,178 --> 02:24:12,836
ORION: Oh.

3232
02:24:12,836 --> 02:24:13,805
LAURA: What is this?

3233
02:24:13,805 --> 02:24:18,142
MATT: These two large, armored, beak-faced
subterranean creatures with shells on their backs

3234
02:24:18,142 --> 02:24:20,658
and giant hooked arms leap down from the ceiling.

3235
02:24:20,658 --> 02:24:24,425
LAURA: We're gonna die.

3236
02:24:24,425 --> 02:24:32,638
MATT: One is going to attempt to strike with both
of its hook attacks at Pike.

3237
02:24:32,638 --> 02:24:34,027
LAURA: Pike isn't here!

3238
02:24:34,027 --> 02:24:35,657
MATT: This is one is moving over Tiberius.

3239
02:24:35,657 --> 02:24:38,387
LIAM: Oh, Tiberius, our soft, vulnerable spot.

3240
02:24:38,387 --> 02:24:39,959
ORION: What are you talking about?

3241
02:24:39,959 --> 02:24:42,688
MATT: So, against Pike, that is 21.

3242
02:24:42,688 --> 02:24:43,736
LAURA: Hits.

3243
02:24:43,736 --> 02:24:44,320
TRAVIS: Hits.

3244
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:45,448
MATT: And 13.

3245
02:24:45,448 --> 02:24:46,206
TRAVIS: Misses.

3246
02:24:46,206 --> 02:24:47,102
LAURA: Misses.

3247
02:24:47,102 --> 02:24:48,827
MATT: All right, you take 11 points of piercing
damage.

3248
02:24:48,827 --> 02:24:50,663
LAURA: Okay.

3249
02:24:50,663 --> 02:24:55,232
MATT: Wherever she is. And the other one misses,
clanging against the armor. The hook scrapes

3250
02:24:55,232 --> 02:25:01,209
across metal, leaving this extremely loud sound.
The other one goes twice against Tiberius.

3251
02:25:01,209 --> 02:25:02,876
That is a 16.

3252
02:25:02,876 --> 02:25:04,565
ORION: A 17.

3253
02:25:04,565 --> 02:25:15,949
MATT: And a nine. Both miss. Barely getting out of
the way. This giant, large, armored creature.

3254
02:25:16,014 --> 02:25:17,749
ASHLEY: Falling from the ceiling.

3255
02:25:17,749 --> 02:25:20,303
MATT: Right there, take a look-- All right, that
ends that, so top of the round.

3256
02:25:20,303 --> 02:25:22,188
Tiberius, you're up.

3257
02:25:22,188 --> 02:25:25,617
ORION: Oh, I look at him with a funky grin.

3258
02:25:25,617 --> 02:25:26,367
MATT: All right.

3259
02:25:26,367 --> 02:25:34,903
ORION: It's a funky one. How much does he weigh?
800 pounds?

3260
02:25:34,903 --> 02:25:41,538
MATT: Pretty heavy. Say probably close to 500-600
pounds.

3261
02:25:41,538 --> 02:25:46,235
ORION: Ah, beautiful. I cast Telekinesis and I
hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other

3262
02:25:46,235 --> 02:25:55,321
one. I want to get him away from Pike. I don't
think I can throw him that far. How far away is he

3263
02:25:55,321 --> 02:25:56,658
from the lava, actually?

3264
02:25:56,658 --> 02:25:58,586
MATT: It's about right there. It's about 35 feet.

3265
02:25:58,586 --> 02:26:00,089
ASHLEY: I'm okay. I have a lot of armor.

3266
02:26:00,089 --> 02:26:01,224
LAURA: She's good.

3267
02:26:01,224 --> 02:26:03,579
ORION: Then I'll try that instead. I'll try to
slam dunk.

3268
02:26:03,579 --> 02:26:10,322
MATT: He makes a saving throw. That fails
entirely. So the creature in front of you lifts up

3269
02:26:10,322 --> 02:26:14,746
in the air, and starts flailing about with its
hooks, trying to find some purchase in the

3270
02:26:14,746 --> 02:26:20,163
ceiling. You toss it over, and it lands squarely
into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel.

3271
02:26:20,163 --> 02:26:26,504
You hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to
find his way out. Okay.

3272
02:26:26,504 --> 02:26:27,823
LIAM: Yes! Yes!

3273
02:26:27,823 --> 02:26:32,086
MARISHA: I like lava pools. I like lava pools.

3274
02:26:32,086 --> 02:26:40,957
MATT: As it's fully submerged, all right, that is
45 points of fire damage on it immediately as it's

3275
02:26:41,031 --> 02:26:42,958
slowly sinking into the pool of lava.

3276
02:26:42,958 --> 02:26:45,649
TRAVIS: He starts sinking into the pool of lava?

3277
02:26:45,649 --> 02:26:46,718
ASHLEY: Whoa.

3278
02:26:46,718 --> 02:26:49,200
MATT: Tiberius just Telekinesis-ed him up in the
air, and threw it into the lava pool.

3279
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:50,041
TRAVIS: Yes.

3280
02:26:50,041 --> 02:26:51,034
LAURA: Good job.

3281
02:26:51,034 --> 02:26:55,193
ORION: I use two sorcerer points, and with the
other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy.

3282
02:26:55,193 --> 02:26:59,867
MATT: The other one there? Okay. Go ahead and
roll-- Add your--

3283
02:26:59,867 --> 02:27:04,733
LAURA: Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking
cool. Badass.

3284
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:08,500
ORION: Spell attack, right?

3285
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:09,517
MATT: Yeah.

3286
02:27:09,517 --> 02:27:13,839
ORION: 13 plus two. 15.

3287
02:27:13,913 --> 02:27:21,986
MATT: 15? Right now, because of the level of
darkness in the room, and because of its distance

3288
02:27:21,986 --> 02:27:27,833
from you-- You just managed to fire, just out of
the range of the creature. It hits the wall behind

3289
02:27:27,833 --> 02:27:31,035
him, leaving the slick of ice across the stone
wall behind it,

3290
02:27:31,035 --> 02:27:33,407
but unfortunately not the actual creature.

3291
02:27:33,407 --> 02:27:42,475
ORION: Okay. Okay. Oh! Right behind it? Do I see
myself missing too? Fine. As I'm missing I'll form

3292
02:27:42,475 --> 02:27:48,985
it into a spike at the end where the walls hit.

3293
02:27:48,985 --> 02:27:49,864
MATT: Okay!

3294
02:27:49,864 --> 02:27:51,046
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3295
02:27:51,046 --> 02:27:56,671
MATT: There is now an ice spike jutting out of the
wall right there. All right, that ends your turn,

3296
02:27:56,671 --> 02:27:58,366
unless you want to move. Still got your move
action.

3297
02:27:58,366 --> 02:27:59,223
LAURA: Ooh. Nice!

3298
02:27:59,223 --> 02:28:02,224
ORION: I'm going to-- where's the-- that way.

3299
02:28:02,224 --> 02:28:03,240
MATT: This way.

3300
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:05,390
ORION: Out the hell-- with the stuff-- yes.

3301
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:09,779
MATT: Now it would be the ogres, but they're all
dead.

3302
02:28:09,779 --> 02:28:11,247
(all cheer)

3303
02:28:11,247 --> 02:28:12,455
MATT: Scanlan's up.

3304
02:28:12,455 --> 02:28:15,187
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on, Scanlan!

3305
02:28:15,187 --> 02:28:19,810
MATT: Sees Pike in great danger. Sings a quick
little ditty to go ahead and give an inspiration

3306
02:28:19,810 --> 02:28:23,762
dice to Pike. So you get a d8.

3307
02:28:23,762 --> 02:28:24,836
ASHLEY: Okay.

3308
02:28:24,836 --> 02:28:30,416
MATT: To help you with any sort of attack rolls,
any saving throws, ability checks.

3309
02:28:30,416 --> 02:28:37,340
ASHLEY: How about for healing? Does it help with
healing? Can I add it to anything?

3310
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:39,259
MATT: Just attack rolls, saving throws, and
checks.

3311
02:28:39,259 --> 02:28:40,259
ASHLEY: Okay.

3312
02:28:40,259 --> 02:28:47,873
MATT: Scanlan is going to attempt to dominate the
monster using his Dominate Creature spell. Saving

3313
02:28:47,873 --> 02:29:00,335
throw. It does not make it. The creature that was
harrowing Pike suddenly drops its claws for a

3314
02:29:00,335 --> 02:29:08,235
second, turns away from you, and starts looking
back towards the oozes and Grog.

3315
02:29:08,235 --> 02:29:11,680
That brings us to Vex. You're up.

3316
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:18,727
LAURA: Okay. Do I have line-of-sight on the other
ooze that's attacking Grog? The big one?

3317
02:29:18,727 --> 02:29:25,593
MATT: The big one over here? You do. It's dark,
and you have no light source currently, so you can

3318
02:29:25,593 --> 02:29:28,262
try a shot, but it's going to be at disadvantage.

3319
02:29:28,262 --> 02:29:30,269
LAURA: Okay, then I guess I should just--

3320
02:29:30,269 --> 02:29:33,555
LIAM: Half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet.
Does that pool of lava give anything?

3321
02:29:33,555 --> 02:29:36,370
MATT: It gives a very dull glow to the room. It's
enough where you can see there is something there.

3322
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:38,825
You can even take a shot as opposed to not having
any chance.

3323
02:29:38,825 --> 02:29:42,017
LAURA: What about the little ooze? One of the
little oozes?

3324
02:29:42,017 --> 02:29:44,915
MATT: Same possibility because you're currently
blocked by this creature

3325
02:29:45,002 --> 02:29:46,918
that's currently sinking into the lava.

3326
02:29:46,918 --> 02:29:53,036
LAURA: I guess I should attack the one that's in
the lava.

3327
02:29:53,036 --> 02:29:54,876
MATT: Okay.

3328
02:29:54,876 --> 02:30:07,929
LAURA: Okay. Well. Oh! Can I-- Is he within ten or
five feet of the other, the little ooze?

3329
02:30:07,929 --> 02:30:10,894
MATT: No, he's ten feet from it.

3330
02:30:10,894 --> 02:30:15,036
LAURA: Okay, then I'll just attack him with my--
I'll just attack him.

3331
02:30:15,245 --> 02:30:15,991
MATT: Okay.

3332
02:30:15,991 --> 02:30:17,665
LAURA: This is lame, that's a lame--

3333
02:30:17,665 --> 02:30:18,955
TRAVIS: Do it!

3334
02:30:18,955 --> 02:30:20,077
MATT: So you have two attacks.

3335
02:30:20,077 --> 02:30:21,119
LIAM: Oh.

3336
02:30:21,119 --> 02:30:23,851
LAURA: Oh right, two attacks. 13?

3337
02:30:23,851 --> 02:30:28,598
MATT: 13 misses, unfortunately.

3338
02:30:28,598 --> 02:30:31,286
LAURA: Pathetic. 20-something.

3339
02:30:31,286 --> 02:30:35,019
MATT: That hits. So the first one, you fire
towards it, except the arrow just (whoosh) into

3340
02:30:35,019 --> 02:30:36,539
the lava and (puff).

3341
02:30:36,539 --> 02:30:37,551
LAURA: All right, cool.

3342
02:30:37,551 --> 02:30:38,898
MATT: With a slight puff of smoke.

3343
02:30:38,898 --> 02:30:40,896
LAURA: Can I have used my flaming bowstring on the
second one?

3344
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,778
MATT: On the second one? If you'd like to.

3345
02:30:41,778 --> 02:30:47,927
LAURA: Sweet. Oh! And I Hunter's Marked him,
because I can do that.

3346
02:30:47,927 --> 02:30:50,156
MATT: All right, so you moved the Hunter's Mark
over, he is now your quarry.

3347
02:30:50,156 --> 02:30:51,005
LAURA: 13.

3348
02:30:51,005 --> 02:30:52,880
MATT: Go ahead and roll the additional fire damage
and your quarry damage.

3349
02:30:52,880 --> 02:31:03,886
LAURA: 13. 19 and 22 damage.

3350
02:31:03,886 --> 02:31:10,342
MATT: 22 damage, all righty. The one arrow
disappears. The second one, as you release it from

3351
02:31:10,342 --> 02:31:14,228
the bowstring, you feel the slight tingle of the
arcane energy released into the arrow. The arrow

3352
02:31:14,228 --> 02:31:17,737
bursts into flame as it releases from your bow,
streaking and piercing the front of its hide as

3353
02:31:17,737 --> 02:31:19,455
it's trying to claw its way out.

3354
02:31:19,455 --> 02:31:20,221
ORION: Nice!

3355
02:31:20,221 --> 02:31:22,432
MATT: Both of its claws are at the edges of the
lava, and it's pulling itself, screeching, its

3356
02:31:22,432 --> 02:31:26,562
mouth and eyes wild with the severe pain it's
feeling as it's slowly melting him from the

3357
02:31:26,562 --> 02:31:31,996
bottom. The arrow (impact sound) into its shoulder
and burst into flame. It's now freaking out. It

3358
02:31:31,996 --> 02:31:34,392
looks like it's having a really, really rough time
making its way out.

3359
02:31:34,392 --> 02:31:35,251
LAURA: Okay.

3360
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:39,145
MATT: Do you want to move, or you going to stay
where you are?

3361
02:31:39,145 --> 02:31:45,442
LAURA: I'm gonna back up and get against the wall.
Oh wait, that's me!

3362
02:31:45,442 --> 02:31:46,348
MATT: That's you there.

3363
02:31:46,348 --> 02:31:48,488
LAURA: Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna
come up next to Keyleth.

3364
02:31:48,488 --> 02:31:49,493
MATT: All right, so right there?

3365
02:31:49,493 --> 02:31:50,534
LAURA: No, against the wall.

3366
02:31:50,534 --> 02:31:51,391
MATT: All right, there?

3367
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:52,072
LAURA: Yeah.

3368
02:31:52,072 --> 02:31:54,403
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Vax, you're
up.

3369
02:31:54,403 --> 02:32:01,457
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna run over the dude in the
lava, I'm gonna jump on him, probably make an

3370
02:32:01,457 --> 02:32:06,139
acrobatics check and land right around here,
between the two little slimes.

3371
02:32:06,139 --> 02:32:07,000
MATT: Acrobatics check.

3372
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:07,810
LIAM: Yeah.

3373
02:32:07,810 --> 02:32:08,877
LAURA: Don't let the slimes hit you.

3374
02:32:08,877 --> 02:32:10,530
MARISHA: Vault the lava.

3375
02:32:10,530 --> 02:32:12,341
LIAM: It's acrobatics. 22.

3376
02:32:12,341 --> 02:32:15,521
MARISHA: Vault that lava.

3377
02:32:15,521 --> 02:32:18,674
MATT: You jump, impact, and barely land next to
them.

3378
02:32:18,674 --> 02:32:19,705
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3379
02:32:19,705 --> 02:32:21,888
LIAM: Now, because they are, because Grog is--

3380
02:32:21,888 --> 02:32:23,894
MATT: It does get one swipe of attack of
opportunity on you as you pass by.

3381
02:32:23,894 --> 02:32:26,345
LIAM: Fine.

3382
02:32:26,345 --> 02:32:27,630
MATT: That is going to be a 20.

3383
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:29,937
LIAM: Okay. It's fine.

3384
02:32:29,937 --> 02:32:31,560
MATT: So, as you leap off of it, its hook swipes
up towards you.

3385
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:39,547
You go ahead and take 14 points of 
piercing damage.

3386
02:32:39,547 --> 02:32:40,567
LAURA: That's a big hit!

3387
02:32:40,567 --> 02:32:42,366
LIAM: Yeah.

3388
02:32:42,437 --> 02:32:43,645
MATT: All right.

3389
02:32:43,645 --> 02:32:48,957
LIAM: Okay. Okay and since I land, since Grog is
right up against those two--

3390
02:32:48,957 --> 02:32:49,889
MATT: I will eat this later.

3391
02:32:49,889 --> 02:32:55,873
LIAM: I can Sneak Attack one or both of them, so
I'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first.

3392
02:32:55,873 --> 02:32:56,752
MATT: Okay.

3393
02:32:56,752 --> 02:32:57,964
LIAM: This is Sneak Attack.

3394
02:32:57,964 --> 02:32:58,727
MATT: All righty.

3395
02:32:58,727 --> 02:33:00,772
LIAM: This is, this is-- It's an 18.

3396
02:33:00,772 --> 02:33:04,376
MATT: All right, that hits.

3397
02:33:04,376 --> 02:33:11,323
LIAM: Three plus seven is-- this is my flametongue
dagger, so that's-- Oh, hold on, no, I don't know

3398
02:33:11,323 --> 02:33:22,430
what it is yet. Where's my pencil? I'm sending my
dice everywhere. Nine plus six, ten, 15, 18, 40.

3399
02:33:22,430 --> 02:33:27,484
58 on one slime.

3400
02:33:27,484 --> 02:33:29,361
MATT: What is the piercing damage from the
dagger?

3401
02:33:29,361 --> 02:33:30,856
LIAM: The piercing damage?

3402
02:33:30,856 --> 02:33:31,868
MATT: Daggers are piercing, so yeah.

3403
02:33:31,868 --> 02:33:35,516
LIAM: So I don't know. What is that? Is that
what's besides the Sneak Attack damage?

3404
02:33:35,516 --> 02:33:39,101
MATT: Thank you kindly. Mysterious appearance of
paper towels.

3405
02:33:39,171 --> 02:33:46,071
LIAM: That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak
Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak

3406
02:33:46,156 --> 02:33:47,898
Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack.

3407
02:33:47,898 --> 02:33:49,593
MATT: Right. Well, it's a Sneak Attack, because it
is flanking.

3408
02:33:49,593 --> 02:33:50,854
LIAM: So 18 for Sneak Attack.

3409
02:33:50,854 --> 02:33:53,860
MATT: Okay, got you. Cool.

3410
02:33:53,860 --> 02:33:55,473
LIAM: That's first dagger.

3411
02:33:55,473 --> 02:33:56,946
MATT: All right, so second dagger. Go ahead and--

3412
02:33:56,946 --> 02:34:05,331
LIAM: Second dagger attacks the other one. I just
turn around and sink down into the other one for

3413
02:34:05,331 --> 02:34:09,198
16 with the keen, yeah, 16 with the keen dagger.

3414
02:34:09,198 --> 02:34:10,427
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

3415
02:34:10,427 --> 02:34:13,495
LIAM: Okay, and this is probably not Sneak Attack
at this point, or is it? I don't know.

3416
02:34:13,495 --> 02:34:14,604
MATT: No, you'll do only one Sneak Attack per
round.

3417
02:34:14,604 --> 02:34:15,532
LIAM: Okay, eight.

3418
02:34:15,532 --> 02:34:20,049
MATT: Eight, gotcha. So as you rush, you leap off,
take the scratch in the air from the hook horror

3419
02:34:20,049 --> 02:34:24,935
creature. You land on the ground, slash one with
your dagger, slash the other. Both slashes are

3420
02:34:24,935 --> 02:34:31,088
almost simultaneous. As you hit, you feel your
blades gain purchase in both creatures, and you

3421
02:34:31,297 --> 02:34:34,500
look down at your arms as the horrible burning
sensation filters onto your hands as the

3422
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:40,758
splash-back. You take a total of 20 points of acid
damage from the melee attacks

3423
02:34:40,758 --> 02:34:41,787
you took against the creatures.

3424
02:34:41,787 --> 02:34:42,969
LIAM: 20, you said?

3425
02:34:42,969 --> 02:34:43,659
MATT: 20 total, yes.

3426
02:34:43,659 --> 02:34:44,658
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my god.

3427
02:34:44,658 --> 02:34:46,086
LIAM: Okay. All right.

3428
02:34:46,086 --> 02:34:47,603
MATT: All right. That brings us to Percy.

3429
02:34:47,603 --> 02:34:49,016
ASHLEY: You're at 24? Fuck.

3430
02:34:49,016 --> 02:34:50,420
LIAM: It's all right.

3431
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:51,431
TALIESIN: Where's the laser?

3432
02:34:51,431 --> 02:34:53,006
MARISHA: So they're all still alive, all the oozes
are still alive.

3433
02:34:53,006 --> 02:34:54,195
TALIESIN: Laser.

3434
02:34:54,195 --> 02:34:56,414
MARISHA: It was around here somewhere. You had it
last.

3435
02:34:56,414 --> 02:34:58,554
TRAVIS: What are you looking for?

3436
02:34:58,554 --> 02:34:59,725
LAURA: What? What's happening?

3437
02:34:59,725 --> 02:35:00,932
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

3438
02:35:00,932 --> 02:35:02,222
MARISHA: Did I have it? Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait.

3439
02:35:02,222 --> 02:35:03,151
TALIESIN: Yeah you had it, aha!

3440
02:35:03,151 --> 02:35:04,268
MATT: Percy, what you got?

3441
02:35:04,268 --> 02:35:08,812
TALIESIN: I wanna move just slightly to my right.
Just over there

3442
02:35:08,812 --> 02:35:11,003
so I can get a clear shot at the oozes.

3443
02:35:11,003 --> 02:35:13,061
MATT: Okay, so right there?

3444
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:14,892
TALIESIN: Yeah, about right there, so I'm not
going to hit anybody.

3445
02:35:14,892 --> 02:35:15,700
MATT: Okay.

3446
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:19,173
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take two shots at the little
oozes. At the--

3447
02:35:19,173 --> 02:35:20,342
MATT: This one here?

3448
02:35:20,342 --> 02:35:21,438
TALIESIN: Yeah, that right little ooze.

3449
02:35:21,438 --> 02:35:22,475
MATT: Okay.

3450
02:35:22,475 --> 02:35:23,826
MARISHA: Little ooze.

3451
02:35:23,826 --> 02:35:38,949
TALIESIN: First shot. 27 to hit. And that does ten
points of damage. And then I'm gonna take another

3452
02:35:38,949 --> 02:35:45,716
shot at him, I'm going to take a fire shot. And
I'm gonna take a negative five to hit.

3453
02:35:45,716 --> 02:35:48,093
And that's 14.

3454
02:35:48,093 --> 02:35:49,421
MATT: Hits.

3455
02:35:49,421 --> 02:36:00,127
TALIESIN: So that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of
damage plus three points of fire damage.

3456
02:36:00,127 --> 02:36:02,080
MATT: 26, nice.

3457
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:04,500
TRAVIS: Yeah, boy. Perce!

3458
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:05,291
MARISHA: On the little ooze?

3459
02:36:05,291 --> 02:36:06,274
ASHLEY: 26 points of damage?

3460
02:36:06,274 --> 02:36:07,138
LAURA: Woot woot!

3461
02:36:07,138 --> 02:36:08,020
TRAVIS: Wow!

3462
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:08,741
TALIESIN: Plus fire.

3463
02:36:08,741 --> 02:36:09,640
LAURA: Plus fire.

3464
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:10,884
TRAVIS: Get on it, nasty.

3465
02:36:10,884 --> 02:36:11,728
LIAM: Pow, pow, pow, pow.

3466
02:36:11,728 --> 02:36:13,207
MATT: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

3467
02:36:13,207 --> 02:36:14,553
MARISHA: All the oozes are still alive?

3468
02:36:14,553 --> 02:36:16,079
MATT: Yeah.

3469
02:36:16,079 --> 02:36:19,323
MARISHA: Damn oozes. All right. I'm gonna do
something crafty.

3470
02:36:19,323 --> 02:36:20,444
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3471
02:36:20,444 --> 02:36:21,698
ASHLEY: Get it!

3472
02:36:21,698 --> 02:36:23,582
MATT: Gotta eat sometime, guys.

3473
02:36:23,582 --> 02:36:28,103
MARISHA: I'm gonna bamf into an eagle.

3474
02:36:28,103 --> 02:36:29,480
MATT: All right.

3475
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:34,618
MARISHA: I'm gonna fly over-- I think I'm going to
land right by here.

3476
02:36:34,618 --> 02:36:35,454
MATT: There?

3477
02:36:35,454 --> 02:36:36,198
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3478
02:36:36,198 --> 02:36:36,863
MATT: All right.

3479
02:36:36,863 --> 02:36:39,507
MARISHA: And I'm gonna do Thunder Wave. Which
is--

3480
02:36:39,507 --> 02:36:40,998
MATT: So you're coming out of eagle form?

3481
02:36:40,998 --> 02:36:42,938
MARISHA: So I'm coming out of eagle form. I was
just using the eagle to fly.

3482
02:36:42,938 --> 02:36:44,708
MATT: Okay, okay.

3483
02:36:44,708 --> 02:36:47,326
MARISHA: Coming out of eagle form, and I'm gonna
do my thunderpush.

3484
02:36:47,326 --> 02:36:53,866
So I take my staff and I throw it down. Kerplash.

3485
02:36:53,866 --> 02:36:54,625
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3486
02:36:54,625 --> 02:36:55,720
MARISHA: Today it's kerplash.

3487
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:56,534
TRAVIS: I buy kerplash.

3488
02:36:56,534 --> 02:36:58,232
MARISHA: Kerplash!

3489
02:36:58,232 --> 02:36:59,310
TALIESIN: Okay.

3490
02:36:59,310 --> 02:37:02,156
MATT: All right! So what is the radius effect on
that?

3491
02:37:02,156 --> 02:37:08,609
MARISHA: It's a 15-foot cube and it pushes
everything ten feet away from me. Directly away.

3492
02:37:08,609 --> 02:37:12,205
MATT: 15-foot cube, okay. So like this cube here?

3493
02:37:12,205 --> 02:37:16,175
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, a cube in front of me.

3494
02:37:16,175 --> 02:37:19,296
MATT: All right, cool. So, they both get saving
throws.

3495
02:37:19,296 --> 02:37:21,499
MARISHA: Not Grog, though. I'm gonna just--

3496
02:37:21,499 --> 02:37:26,761
MATT: You can do that. Okay, neither makes their
saving throw. So go ahead and roll damage,

3497
02:37:26,761 --> 02:37:28,214
or whatever it does.

3498
02:37:28,214 --> 02:37:29,593
MARISHA: 2d8.

3499
02:37:29,593 --> 02:37:32,351
MATT: 2d8 to each. What is the damage type on
that?

3500
02:37:32,351 --> 02:37:36,591
MARISHA: Six. It just says damage and then they're
pushed. I was--

3501
02:37:36,591 --> 02:37:38,469
MATT: Okay. So I'll go ahead and say it's thunder
damage. All right,

3502
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:39,543
so they're pushed how long? Ten feet?

3503
02:37:39,543 --> 02:37:42,132
MARISHA: Ten feet. Directly away from me.

3504
02:37:42,132 --> 02:37:44,318
MATT: Yeah. So they're pushed right there. Got
it.

3505
02:37:44,318 --> 02:37:46,690
MARISHA: I was hoping they would go into the
lava.

3506
02:37:46,690 --> 02:37:50,622
MATT: Unfortunately, it's not far enough. Is that
your turn?

3507
02:37:50,622 --> 02:37:51,573
MARISHA: Yep!

3508
02:37:51,573 --> 02:37:53,796
MATT: All right. Pike!

3509
02:37:53,796 --> 02:38:03,519
ASHLEY: Okay, can I sprinter's boot over to Grog?
Sorry, no glasses, guys.

3510
02:38:03,519 --> 02:38:06,177
So I don't see where I am.

3511
02:38:06,177 --> 02:38:08,102
TRAVIS: A boot?

3512
02:38:08,102 --> 02:38:09,218
MATT: You can, yes.

3513
02:38:09,218 --> 02:38:13,893
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to Cure Wounds.

3514
02:38:13,893 --> 02:38:14,946
MATT: All right.

3515
02:38:14,946 --> 02:38:17,951
ASHLEY: 'Cause that's what I do.

3516
02:38:17,951 --> 02:38:19,324
MATT: It's what you do as a healer, yo.

3517
02:38:19,324 --> 02:38:24,006
ASHLEY: So let's see, 1d8 plus spell damage. Wait,
so I'm gonna do it at fourth level, so that means

3518
02:38:24,006 --> 02:38:25,310
I can roll how many times?

3519
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:27,714
MATT: 4d8.

3520
02:38:27,714 --> 02:38:29,149
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

3521
02:38:29,149 --> 02:38:30,537
MATT: Plus five.

3522
02:38:30,537 --> 02:38:34,270
ASHLEY: Five, eight, 16.

3523
02:38:34,270 --> 02:38:40,299
LAURA: Ooh! That's good! 24?

3524
02:38:40,299 --> 02:38:42,954
ASHLEY: 24. So you heal 24.

3525
02:38:42,954 --> 02:38:44,094
TRAVIS: Thank you!

3526
02:38:44,094 --> 02:38:45,127
MATT: Nice.

3527
02:38:45,127 --> 02:38:46,433
ASHLEY: And then--

3528
02:38:46,433 --> 02:38:48,389
LAURA: Plus, do you add that to anything?

3529
02:38:48,389 --> 02:38:51,295
ASHLEY: Well, he adds it to his 14 that he already
has.

3530
02:38:51,295 --> 02:38:52,768
MATT: Sorry.

3531
02:38:52,768 --> 02:38:57,960
ASHLEY: And then, can I do anything else while I'm
there?

3532
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:03,610
MATT: No, bonus action to do the item, move,
action to cast the spell.

3533
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:05,099
ORION: No.

3534
02:39:05,099 --> 02:39:06,627
ASHLEY: Okay.

3535
02:39:06,627 --> 02:39:07,391
MATT: So that's your turn.

3536
02:39:07,391 --> 02:39:08,052
ASHLEY: Okay.

3537
02:39:08,052 --> 02:39:10,446
MATT: Well done. All right, that brings us to
Grog.

3538
02:39:10,446 --> 02:39:13,836
TRAVIS: Right, yeah. I would like to come out of
my rage.

3539
02:39:13,836 --> 02:39:15,795
MATT: All right. So it's level two exhaustion.

3540
02:39:15,795 --> 02:39:17,474
TRAVIS: For the first time ever.

3541
02:39:17,474 --> 02:39:18,450
LAURA: Ever.

3542
02:39:18,450 --> 02:39:20,788
LIAM: Wow. Not sure how I feel about that.

3543
02:39:20,788 --> 02:39:27,517
TRAVIS: What do you-- where do you wanna go?
Towards Keyleth or toward the-- Okay. I'd like to

3544
02:39:27,517 --> 02:39:35,741
pick up Pike and run balls over this way.

3545
02:39:35,741 --> 02:39:36,543
MATT: Okay.

3546
02:39:36,543 --> 02:39:37,886
TRAVIS: Right towards this area.

3547
02:39:37,886 --> 02:39:38,694
MATT: Okay.

3548
02:39:38,694 --> 02:39:40,065
LIAM: I'm all on my own.

3549
02:39:40,065 --> 02:39:44,692
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, look. It nearly killed me the
one time I hit it.

3550
02:39:44,692 --> 02:39:47,286
ORION: You shouldn't be doing melee on things that
can split in half to begin with.

3551
02:39:47,286 --> 02:39:48,452
LAURA: We're gonna die.

3552
02:39:48,452 --> 02:39:50,994
MATT: All right, so you pick up Pike. Level two
exhaustion, your speed is halved.

3553
02:39:50,994 --> 02:39:51,781
LAURA: Oh no.

3554
02:39:51,781 --> 02:39:52,742
TRAVIS: Okay.

3555
02:39:52,742 --> 02:39:53,796
MATT: So you can only move 20 feet.

3556
02:39:53,796 --> 02:39:54,442
TRAVIS: Right.

3557
02:39:54,442 --> 02:39:55,317
ORION: You messed everything up.

3558
02:39:55,317 --> 02:39:56,631
LIAM: Hey man, if I can't be a hero here, where am
I gonna do it?

3559
02:39:56,631 --> 02:39:57,603
ORION: Oh, every other time is fine.

3560
02:39:57,603 --> 02:39:58,954
TRAVIS: Do you want to stay? It doesn't really
matter.

3561
02:39:58,954 --> 02:40:00,312
MATT: You grab her, you turn--

3562
02:40:00,312 --> 02:40:01,325
TRAVIS: You want to stay over there?

3563
02:40:01,325 --> 02:40:02,383
MATT: -- run that way?

3564
02:40:02,383 --> 02:40:03,389
TRAVIS: You know what? I'll--

3565
02:40:03,389 --> 02:40:07,703
MARISHA: Aim for in front of the Scientology
Center. It always goes over really well.

3566
02:40:07,703 --> 02:40:09,544
TRAVIS: Do you just wanna stay?

3567
02:40:09,638 --> 02:40:10,795
ASHLEY: I'm gonna-- I'll stay, I'll stay.

3568
02:40:10,795 --> 02:40:14,971
TRAVIS: I'll leave Pike where she is and I'll run
up and flank Iceberg Lobsterface.

3569
02:40:14,971 --> 02:40:15,853
MATT: Right there?

3570
02:40:15,853 --> 02:40:16,572
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3571
02:40:16,572 --> 02:40:17,941
MATT: Okay, so, that's as far as you can get,
unfortunately--

3572
02:40:17,941 --> 02:40:18,791
TRAVIS: Okay.

3573
02:40:18,791 --> 02:40:20,181
MATT: -- 'cause you're double-fatigued.

3574
02:40:20,181 --> 02:40:21,549
TALIESIN: My name in high school.

3575
02:40:21,549 --> 02:40:23,154
MATT: As you run past, both of those slimes--

3576
02:40:23,154 --> 02:40:23,951
ASHLEY: Double?

3577
02:40:23,951 --> 02:40:24,749
MARISHA: Double-fatigue?

3578
02:40:24,749 --> 02:40:26,062
TALIESIN: Iceberg Lobsterface.

3579
02:40:26,062 --> 02:40:27,931
MATT: -- flash out with pseudopods, as reactions.

3580
02:40:27,931 --> 02:40:29,121
LIAM: I'm surrounded by shit.

3581
02:40:29,121 --> 02:40:30,542
TALIESIN: It's what all the kids called me.

3582
02:40:30,542 --> 02:40:31,631
MATT: So, two attacks against you.

3583
02:40:31,631 --> 02:40:32,411
TALIESIN: Long story.

3584
02:40:32,411 --> 02:40:33,309
MATT: That's a 22.

3585
02:40:33,309 --> 02:40:33,947
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3586
02:40:33,947 --> 02:40:34,707
ASHLEY: Fuck!

3587
02:40:34,707 --> 02:40:35,608
MATT: And a 19.

3588
02:40:35,608 --> 02:40:36,422
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3589
02:40:36,422 --> 02:40:39,135
MATT: All right, so both slam you for 24 points of
bludgeoning damage.

3590
02:40:39,135 --> 02:40:40,313
You're not raged, so it's not halved.

3591
02:40:40,313 --> 02:40:40,990
TRAVIS: Okay.

3592
02:40:40,990 --> 02:40:41,825
LAURA: Ugh.

3593
02:40:41,825 --> 02:40:48,386
MATT: So 24 against you, with an additional 56
points of acid damage.

3594
02:40:48,386 --> 02:40:49,148
ASHLEY: Wait! What?

3595
02:40:49,148 --> 02:40:53,176
TRAVIS: Unconscious!

3596
02:40:53,176 --> 02:40:56,693
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3597
02:40:56,693 --> 02:40:58,551
LAURA: Why didn't you get acid damage?

3598
02:40:58,551 --> 02:40:59,569
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

3599
02:40:59,569 --> 02:41:03,081
MATT: They haven't hit him yet. That was just Grog
running away.

3600
02:41:03,188 --> 02:41:03,841
LAURA: Oh.

3601
02:41:03,841 --> 02:41:08,047
MATT: Both of them getting attacks of opportunity
on him, and both hitting.

3602
02:41:08,047 --> 02:41:09,747
LIAM: I am surrounded by shit.

3603
02:41:09,747 --> 02:41:10,880
ASHLEY: Guys, guys, guys.

3604
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:14,618
MATT: Grog falls face-first, right next-- right,
like, literally cradling-- His unconscious body is

3605
02:41:14,618 --> 02:41:16,527
cradling the two dead ogres right now.

3606
02:41:16,527 --> 02:41:17,554
LAURA: No!

3607
02:41:17,554 --> 02:41:21,263
MATT: This slight sound of 'sss' as the acid is,
like, sizzling and scarring his flesh.

3608
02:41:21,263 --> 02:41:23,543
LAURA: Nobody attack the things up close!

3609
02:41:23,543 --> 02:41:25,898
MATT: That brings us to their turn.

3610
02:41:25,898 --> 02:41:27,419
LAURA: Oh, no!

3611
02:41:27,419 --> 02:41:30,100
LIAM: I'm going unconscious here, kids.

3612
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,546
LAURA: All of our heavy hitters are dead.

3613
02:41:32,546 --> 02:41:38,542
MATT: These three oozes turn. Actually, this
one's going to move here--

3614
02:41:38,542 --> 02:41:40,469
ASHLEY: Oh, hello!

3615
02:41:40,469 --> 02:41:41,885
MATT: -- towards Pike.

3616
02:41:41,885 --> 02:41:43,416
LIAM: (Tommy Wiseau voice) Oh, hi, Pike.

3617
02:41:43,416 --> 02:41:44,384
(all laugh)

3618
02:41:44,384 --> 02:41:45,981
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity on it, if
you like--

3619
02:41:45,981 --> 02:41:46,873
LAURA: Oh, hit it!

3620
02:41:46,873 --> 02:41:48,066
LIAM: Hit it? Yeah.

3621
02:41:48,066 --> 02:41:49,440
MATT: -- as it slips away.

3622
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:50,220
LAURA: Get it!

3623
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:51,101
TALIESIN: Get it!

3624
02:41:51,101 --> 02:41:52,238
LIAM: Do I have to roll to do that? Right?

3625
02:41:52,238 --> 02:41:53,025
MATT: Yeah, you still have roll to hit it.

3626
02:41:53,025 --> 02:41:54,116
LIAM: 26.

3627
02:41:54,116 --> 02:41:54,940
MATT: Hits.

3628
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:56,263
LAURA: Why is it going up there?

3629
02:41:56,263 --> 02:41:58,997
ASHLEY: You're gonna kill this thing!

3630
02:41:58,997 --> 02:41:59,924
LIAM: 11.

3631
02:41:59,924 --> 02:42:01,293
MATT: 11?

3632
02:42:01,293 --> 02:42:02,071
LIAM: Yeah.

3633
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:02,914
MATT: Points of damage?

3634
02:42:02,914 --> 02:42:04,323
LIAM: That's the damage. 11.

3635
02:42:04,323 --> 02:42:05,126
MATT: Yeah.

3636
02:42:05,126 --> 02:42:05,950
LIAM: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

3637
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:07,423
MATT: All right, cool.

3638
02:42:07,423 --> 02:42:10,093
ASHLEY: What did you guys vote on?

3639
02:42:10,093 --> 02:42:11,382
MARISHA: No shit.

3640
02:42:11,382 --> 02:42:12,433
LAURA: Did they vote on this?

3641
02:42:12,433 --> 02:42:13,470
ASHLEY: Probably.

3642
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:15,702
MATT: So, the one that's attacking you, Pike, that
is a--

3643
02:42:15,702 --> 02:42:16,897
LAURA: You guys suck.

3644
02:42:16,897 --> 02:42:19,145
MATT: -- 23, versus armor class.

3645
02:42:19,145 --> 02:42:20,839
ASHLEY: Yes, that hits.

3646
02:42:20,839 --> 02:42:22,543
(all laugh)

3647
02:42:22,543 --> 02:42:25,639
MATT: All right. You take 12 points of bludgeoning
damage from the impact of the pseudopod, with an

3648
02:42:25,639 --> 02:42:27,367
additional 28 points of acid damage.

3649
02:42:27,367 --> 02:42:29,212
LIAM: Son of a gun.

3650
02:42:29,212 --> 02:42:30,162
MARISHA: Pseudopod?

3651
02:42:30,162 --> 02:42:31,697
ASHLEY: Okay, so an additional 28 on top of that.

3652
02:42:31,697 --> 02:42:33,059
TRAVIS: You guys are dicks.

3653
02:42:33,059 --> 02:42:34,220
MATT: Yeah, so a total of 40 points of damage from
the strike.

3654
02:42:34,220 --> 02:42:35,185
ASHLEY: I understand.

3655
02:42:35,185 --> 02:42:36,412
MARISHA: Did he just call it a 'pseudopod'?

3656
02:42:36,412 --> 02:42:41,059
LIAM: Masochists.

3657
02:42:41,059 --> 02:42:43,189
MATT: The other two are going to attack you.

3658
02:42:43,189 --> 02:42:44,628
LIAM: Sure they are.

3659
02:42:44,628 --> 02:42:47,299
MATT: That's going to be a 19 versus armor class.

3660
02:42:47,299 --> 02:42:52,111
LIAM: Yeah, that hits 'cause I'm at 19. Right? So
that hits if I'm at 19?

3661
02:42:52,111 --> 02:42:55,699
MATT: It hits. Yeah. Okay. The other one is a 14,
so that misses.

3662
02:42:55,699 --> 02:42:57,478
LIAM: Okay, so I use Uncanny Dodge on the one that
hit.

3663
02:42:57,478 --> 02:42:58,358
MARISHA: Oh!

3664
02:42:58,358 --> 02:42:59,224
MATT: All right. So.

3665
02:42:59,224 --> 02:42:59,909
TALIESIN: Nice!

3666
02:42:59,909 --> 02:43:00,739
LIAM: Whoa!

3667
02:43:00,739 --> 02:43:01,602
MARISHA: Yeah you do.

3668
02:43:01,602 --> 02:43:02,998
MATT: As you pull that away, you-- You take
half-damage from the strike?

3669
02:43:02,998 --> 02:43:03,917
LIAM: Half-damage. That's right.

3670
02:43:03,917 --> 02:43:06,727
MATT: All right, so that's-- this was a 40. Take
20 points of damage, total,

3671
02:43:06,727 --> 02:43:07,767
from the bludgeoning and the acid.

3672
02:43:07,767 --> 02:43:10,095
LIAM: Oh, I am rough, kids. I am rough.

3673
02:43:10,095 --> 02:43:11,826
LAURA: Plus acid?

3674
02:43:11,826 --> 02:43:13,798
MATT: All right. That ends their turn.

3675
02:43:13,869 --> 02:43:17,811
LAURA: Oh my god.

3676
02:43:17,811 --> 02:43:19,868
MATT: Clarota--

3677
02:43:19,868 --> 02:43:21,648
LAURA: Clarota, save us!

3678
02:43:21,648 --> 02:43:22,959
MATT: -- is going to step forward to there.

3679
02:43:22,959 --> 02:43:24,785
LIAM: Use your magic, you strange flayer, you.

3680
02:43:24,785 --> 02:43:25,866
LAURA: Do not use Lightning Bolt.

3681
02:43:25,866 --> 02:43:26,917
MARISHA: Yeah. No Lightning Bolt, Clarota.

3682
02:43:26,917 --> 02:43:31,412
MATT: Clarota reaches forward, uses his own--
Taking a note from Tiberius, uses his Telekinesis

3683
02:43:31,412 --> 02:43:38,330
spell. The arcanist marks on its body flare up,
and as it does you can see this large creature--

3684
02:43:38,330 --> 02:43:39,415
LAURA: Yeah.

3685
02:43:39,415 --> 02:43:43,155
MATT: -- gets lifted up, and slams on top of this
hook horror--

3686
02:43:43,155 --> 02:43:43,888
ORION: Yes!

3687
02:43:43,888 --> 02:43:44,872
LIAM: That's awesome.

3688
02:43:44,872 --> 02:43:47,116
MATT: -- pushing it further into the lava and
doing additional

3689
02:43:47,116 --> 02:43:48,886
acid damage to the hook horror, which--

3690
02:43:48,886 --> 02:43:50,675
LAURA: Yeah! And it dies?

3691
02:43:50,675 --> 02:43:52,604
ORION: Damn hook whores!

3692
02:43:52,604 --> 02:43:53,891
LIAM: (Cosby voice) You see--

3693
02:43:53,891 --> 02:43:57,437
MATT: -- which completely dissolves and melts the
hook horror.

3694
02:43:57,437 --> 02:43:59,191
(all cheer)

3695
02:43:59,191 --> 02:44:01,225
TRAVIS: All right, Clarence!

3696
02:44:01,225 --> 02:44:06,139
MATT: As it pushes down, the ooze just touches the
edge of the lava, not taking full damage from the

3697
02:44:06,139 --> 02:44:08,554
impact, but just enough from the portion of it.

3698
02:44:08,554 --> 02:44:09,847
LIAM (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence! Clarence!

3699
02:44:09,847 --> 02:44:17,916
MATT: Taking an additional five points of fire
damage. All right, it's that one there. Great. All

3700
02:44:17,916 --> 02:44:24,588
right, that brings us to the hook horror's turn,
who is currently dominated by Scanlan. Is going to

3701
02:44:24,588 --> 02:44:28,320
rush forward to the edge here, and strike twice at
the--

3702
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:29,434
LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan!

3703
02:44:29,434 --> 02:44:35,806
MATT: -- creature in the lava. Both hit.

3704
02:44:35,806 --> 02:44:36,971
TRAVIS: Yes!

3705
02:44:36,971 --> 02:44:38,169
LAURA: I'm full.

3706
02:44:38,169 --> 02:44:51,870
MATT: It's prone. That deals six plus 14. Eight.
All right. The hook horror that Scanlan's

3707
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:57,911
controlling slams its hooks down into the ooze,
causing the ooze to get pushed further into the

3708
02:44:57,911 --> 02:45:02,197
lava. As you see its form begin to dissipate and
slowly disintegrate into the pool of lava.

3709
02:45:02,197 --> 02:45:03,989
LAURA: Yeah!

3710
02:45:03,989 --> 02:45:08,121
MATT: Leaving this dark, cooled kind of surface
element to it. Slowly breaking apart,

3711
02:45:08,121 --> 02:45:09,717
dissipating over the magma.

3712
02:45:09,717 --> 02:45:10,742
ASHLEY: Bye, bitch.

3713
02:45:10,742 --> 02:45:14,292
MATT: End of its turn, it's going to try and make
a saving throw against the domination effect.

3714
02:45:14,292 --> 02:45:21,718
Rolls a natural 20. Breaks the effect, however I
feel like it did its good for the turn.

3715
02:45:21,718 --> 02:45:25,454
LAURA: Damn it. Did he take acid damage? Is he
hurt?

3716
02:45:25,454 --> 02:45:27,119
MATT: Yeah, he did. He took 20 points of acid
damage from each strike.

3717
02:45:27,119 --> 02:45:28,372
LAURA: Nice. Good, good, good.

3718
02:45:28,372 --> 02:45:29,474
ASHLEY: So there is only one left?

3719
02:45:29,474 --> 02:45:30,715
LAURA: No, there is two little oozes and a big
one.

3720
02:45:30,715 --> 02:45:31,967
LIAM: Two oozes and a monster man.

3721
02:45:31,967 --> 02:45:34,592
MATT: All right, that brings us to the top of the
turn. Tiberius, you're up.

3722
02:45:34,683 --> 02:45:38,689
ORION: Ah very well. I scooch myself a little bit
over behind him.

3723
02:45:38,689 --> 02:45:41,757
MARISHA: (sings) One little two little three
little oozes.

3724
02:45:41,757 --> 02:45:43,068
MATT: Over here?

3725
02:45:43,068 --> 02:45:48,619
ORION: Yeah, that's good, I can see his fanny from
here. I'm going to cast Glacial Blast again, but

3726
02:45:48,619 --> 02:45:53,511
I'm going to form a giant spike once more and jam
it right in his asshole.

3727
02:45:53,511 --> 02:45:56,254
LIAM: Oh, he's pulling a Vax.

3728
02:45:56,254 --> 02:45:59,615
ORION: And I'm going to try and catapult it right
where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of

3729
02:45:59,615 --> 02:46:01,140
the lava pool, right?

3730
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:07,268
MATT: Mm-hm. So you're going to glacial spike in
the-- Kancho him. Magically kancho.

3731
02:46:07,268 --> 02:46:09,705
ORION: Magic ice kancho blast.

3732
02:46:09,705 --> 02:46:12,941
MATT: Arcane cheat code. All right. So go ahead
and roll to attack.

3733
02:46:12,941 --> 02:46:15,158
LIAM: Up up down down left right left right.

3734
02:46:15,158 --> 02:46:16,456
TRAVIS: A B A B N.

3735
02:46:16,456 --> 02:46:21,043
ORION: 24.

3736
02:46:21,043 --> 02:46:23,661
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

3737
02:46:23,661 --> 02:46:39,845
ORION: Yeah. One, two, three, four, six. That is
eight. What is that, a 12? 15, 16, 18, 19.

3738
02:46:40,077 --> 02:46:41,749
20. 20 damage.

3739
02:46:41,749 --> 02:46:47,380
MATT: 20 damage? All right, and he's grappled,
correct?

3740
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:49,457
ORION: I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying
to just push him.

3741
02:46:49,457 --> 02:46:50,791
MATT: Push him? Shove?

3742
02:46:50,791 --> 02:46:51,694
ORION: Yeah.

3743
02:46:51,694 --> 02:46:53,203
LAURA: Into the lava.

3744
02:46:53,203 --> 02:46:56,759
ORION: Because he's like swinging at that dude so
I'm like up his keister.

3745
02:46:56,759 --> 02:46:58,239
MATT: All right. All right. So he does make his
saving throw.

3746
02:46:58,239 --> 02:46:59,122
ORION: Okay.

3747
02:46:59,122 --> 02:47:03,469
MATT: Unfortunately, so it doesn't push him into
the lava, but it does slam him and does a shit-ton

3748
02:47:03,676 --> 02:47:04,966
of damage to him, so.

3749
02:47:05,036 --> 02:47:06,506
ORION: Nice.

3750
02:47:06,506 --> 02:47:07,433
MARISHA: In his pooper.

3751
02:47:07,433 --> 02:47:08,541
MATT: Looking rough. Just a little bit.

3752
02:47:08,541 --> 02:47:11,031
ORION: Yeah. I'll spend another two points.

3753
02:47:11,031 --> 02:47:12,786
MATT: How many points do you have now?

3754
02:47:12,786 --> 02:47:13,939
ORION: After this, I'll have five.

3755
02:47:13,939 --> 02:47:15,247
MATT: Okay.

3756
02:47:15,247 --> 02:47:16,868
ORION: Because we had the rest, I regenerated all
my stuff.

3757
02:47:16,868 --> 02:47:17,948
MATT: Right. Right.

3758
02:47:17,948 --> 02:47:19,928
ORION: So I spent two already.

3759
02:47:19,928 --> 02:47:20,864
TRAVIS: He's making trouble.

3760
02:47:20,864 --> 02:47:24,135
ORION: I spent another two on the fight. And I'm
going to do another one. Up his ass again.

3761
02:47:24,135 --> 02:47:25,934
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

3762
02:47:25,934 --> 02:47:28,254
ORION: Yeah. 20.

3763
02:47:28,254 --> 02:47:29,622
MATT: Uh-huh.

3764
02:47:29,622 --> 02:47:32,443
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3765
02:47:32,443 --> 02:47:42,489
ORION: Yeah and that is 15. 15 points of damage.

3766
02:47:42,489 --> 02:47:45,963
MATT: Makes his saving throw again, unfortunately.
It does not push him. Does additional points of

3767
02:47:45,963 --> 02:47:49,792
damage. He's looking really rough. You can see
now, this ice has encrusted

3768
02:47:49,792 --> 02:47:51,217
around the outside of its armor.

3769
02:47:51,217 --> 02:47:52,369
ORION: And his butt.

3770
02:47:52,369 --> 02:47:55,927
MATT: And where the wounds from the impact are,
there's cracking

3771
02:47:55,927 --> 02:48:00,064
shards of ice crystal jutting outward.

3772
02:48:00,064 --> 02:48:01,961
ORION: From his arsehole.

3773
02:48:01,961 --> 02:48:11,272
MATT: From his asshole. Scanlan's turn. Should
have had your sheet, Scanlan. Scanlan's going to

3774
02:48:11,272 --> 02:48:15,152
go ahead and, for the hell of it, run up and make
an attack.

3775
02:48:15,152 --> 02:48:17,390
(all laugh)

3776
02:48:17,390 --> 02:48:18,702
TRAVIS: Eff him up, Scanlan.

3777
02:48:18,702 --> 02:48:19,694
ASHLEY: Let's go, Scanlan.

3778
02:48:19,694 --> 02:48:23,946
MATT: Why not? Pulling out, his singing sword
arches in the air, and begins humming to it as he

3779
02:48:23,946 --> 02:48:28,084
walks upon-- The humming kind of adds this
vibration element, like a tuning fork blade, as he

3780
02:48:28,084 --> 02:48:31,963
arcs the sword down.

3781
02:48:31,963 --> 02:48:37,444
MATT: A natural 18. I'm going to assume that hits.
That's going to be a 1d8 longsword damage. That's

3782
02:48:37,444 --> 02:48:42,872
an 8 plus-- 12 points of damage.

3783
02:48:42,872 --> 02:48:43,828
LAURA: Woo, Scanlan.

3784
02:48:43,828 --> 02:48:44,942
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah, Scanlan.

3785
02:48:44,942 --> 02:48:46,265
ASHLEY: Go Scanlan.

3786
02:48:46,265 --> 02:48:52,527
MATT: The blade swings down to where the ice has
encrusted the back of its armored shell. Scanlan

3787
02:48:52,527 --> 02:48:56,823
takes the blade, swings it down, and pierces it
directly into where that ice has gathered. As it

3788
02:48:56,823 --> 02:49:03,262
does, it cracks open the back of its armored
shell. Almost peeling it open like a shrimp. You

3789
02:49:03,262 --> 02:49:08,501
can now see all its fleshy innards are exposed
to the outside. It's looking extremely, extremely

3790
02:49:08,570 --> 02:49:11,488
close to death. It's screaming in pain, kind of
thrashing about now.

3791
02:49:11,488 --> 02:49:12,818
LIAM: Shrimping, cool.

3792
02:49:12,818 --> 02:49:14,480
MATT: Vex, you're up.

3793
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:18,094
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the bad
guy.

3794
02:49:18,094 --> 02:49:19,480
MATT: This guy?

3795
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,489
LAURA: Yeah.

3796
02:49:20,489 --> 02:49:21,209
MATT: All right.

3797
02:49:21,209 --> 02:49:23,331
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I should save my brother.

3798
02:49:23,331 --> 02:49:24,091
LIAM: Maybe.

3799
02:49:24,091 --> 02:49:26,129
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to attack one of the oozies
instead.

3800
02:49:26,129 --> 02:49:27,063
LIAM: The one right behind me.

3801
02:49:27,063 --> 02:49:28,356
LAURA: The one right behind him.

3802
02:49:28,356 --> 02:49:30,727
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack.

3803
02:49:30,727 --> 02:49:36,574
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, 23.

3804
02:49:36,574 --> 02:49:39,469
MATT: Very nice, very nice, that hits

3805
02:49:39,469 --> 02:49:42,598
LAURA: Oh I Hunter's Mark him first. Bonus.

3806
02:49:42,598 --> 02:49:44,076
ORION: Bonus.

3807
02:49:44,076 --> 02:49:46,614
LIAM: Excellent.

3808
02:49:46,614 --> 02:49:49,533
LAURA: 14 for the first attack.

3809
02:49:49,533 --> 02:49:52,705
ASHLEY: Wait, do we still have Scanlan's
inspiration song?

3810
02:49:52,705 --> 02:49:53,756
MATT: You do, yeah.

3811
02:49:53,756 --> 02:49:54,912
LIAM: You do. You have the die.

3812
02:49:54,912 --> 02:49:57,339
ASHLEY: I have the die. Is what I'm talking about,
sorry.

3813
02:49:57,339 --> 02:50:01,950
LAURA: Do I get six on both attacks? I do, don't
I?

3814
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:04,362
MATT: Mm-hm.

3815
02:50:04,362 --> 02:50:06,236
LAURA: Yeah. 17 on the second attack.

3816
02:50:06,236 --> 02:50:07,003
MATT: All right.

3817
02:50:07,003 --> 02:50:09,605
LIAM: Kill it. Kill it.

3818
02:50:09,605 --> 02:50:13,602
MATT: With a sickening (splat) sound, the ooze
splatters across the floor.

3819
02:50:13,602 --> 02:50:15,135
LAURA: Yeah.

3820
02:50:15,135 --> 02:50:16,229
LIAM: Thank you.

3821
02:50:16,229 --> 02:50:19,418
MATT: Leaving a small, sizzling pool that's
scarring the rock below it. You can see it slowly

3822
02:50:19,418 --> 02:50:23,868
depressing into the ground. You gonna stay where
you are?

3823
02:50:23,868 --> 02:50:24,886
LAURA: Yeah.

3824
02:50:24,886 --> 02:50:27,536
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

3825
02:50:27,536 --> 02:50:33,677
LIAM: All right. I walk back about 15 feet, and I
go (shnk-shnk). Throw daggers at it.

3826
02:50:33,677 --> 02:50:34,797
MATT: Both daggers?

3827
02:50:34,797 --> 02:50:36,523
LIAM: First one's a 15.

3828
02:50:36,523 --> 02:50:37,263
MATT: That hits.

3829
02:50:37,263 --> 02:50:43,676
LIAM: Okay and that is-- this is my keen dagger.
That is nine.

3830
02:50:43,676 --> 02:50:45,951
MATT: Nine hits.

3831
02:50:45,951 --> 02:50:48,862
LIAM: Second dagger. Definitely hits, that's a
26.

3832
02:50:48,862 --> 02:50:51,399
MATT: Hits. None of them are Sneak Attack,
unfortunately.

3833
02:50:51,399 --> 02:50:55,206
LIAM: That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't
know if fire helps, but that is an eight.

3834
02:50:55,206 --> 02:50:56,416
So nine and an eight.

3835
02:50:56,416 --> 02:51:02,521
MATT: Nine and an eight, gotcha. Both daggers
splash into it. You can see where they would

3836
02:51:02,521 --> 02:51:04,581
slowly be scarred and damaged.

3837
02:51:04,581 --> 02:51:06,865
LIAM: Except that they teleport back to my blink
belt.

3838
02:51:06,865 --> 02:51:10,833
LAURA: Yay, blink belt.

3839
02:51:10,833 --> 02:51:15,450
MATT: As they return to your belt, you can feel
there a slight bit of liquid left,

3840
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:16,927
and you shake it off quickly.

3841
02:51:16,927 --> 02:51:18,074
LIAM: Shite.

3842
02:51:18,074 --> 02:51:19,180
LAURA: (sings) Shake it off.

3843
02:51:19,180 --> 02:51:21,842
MATT: But no other effect that that. It looks like
it's having a hard time keeping its form together.

3844
02:51:21,842 --> 02:51:26,612
It's kind of shaking and (oozing sound) as it
moves. Still running towards Pike.

3845
02:51:26,612 --> 02:51:28,185
LIAM: Finish that shit, Pike.

3846
02:51:28,185 --> 02:51:29,420
MATT: That brings us to Percy.

3847
02:51:29,420 --> 02:51:30,676
LIAM: Hit it.

3848
02:51:30,676 --> 02:51:38,095
TALIESIN: All right. I'm just taking the shot.
Taking a shot with the bonus.

3849
02:51:38,095 --> 02:51:40,856
So that's 14 to hit.

3850
02:51:40,856 --> 02:51:41,817
MATT: Mm-hm.

3851
02:51:41,817 --> 02:51:47,820
TALIESIN: That hits. So that's 18 points of
damage.

3852
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:50,139
MATT: All righty.

3853
02:51:50,139 --> 02:51:52,761
TALIESIN: And I'm gonna take the other shot.

3854
02:51:52,761 --> 02:51:56,315
MATT: Is this against the ooze?

3855
02:51:56,315 --> 02:51:58,340
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, the ooze.

3856
02:51:58,340 --> 02:51:59,441
MATT: All right. Yep.

3857
02:51:59,441 --> 02:52:00,643
TALIESIN: And that's 13 to hit.

3858
02:52:00,643 --> 02:52:01,939
ASHLEY: Grog's unconscious?

3859
02:52:01,939 --> 02:52:03,545
LIAM: He'll be fine in ten minutes, Pike.

3860
02:52:03,545 --> 02:52:04,506
ASHLEY: What?

3861
02:52:04,506 --> 02:52:05,654
LIAM: He's out of the fight, but he'll be fine.

3862
02:52:05,654 --> 02:52:06,827
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

3863
02:52:06,827 --> 02:52:08,275
TALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage.

3864
02:52:08,275 --> 02:52:11,389
MATT: The first shot hits, and the ooze kind of
quivers. It leaves this kind of gaping hole, and

3865
02:52:11,389 --> 02:52:15,234
it begins to slowly reform itself. Before it can,
you see the other weak spot where the top of its

3866
02:52:15,234 --> 02:52:21,080
physical form is barely wavering, and it's able to
keep corporeal. You aim the second shot, and as

3867
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:26,479
you fire, it detonates and that portion of its
upper torso-- whatever it would be-- gets flung

3868
02:52:26,479 --> 02:52:28,770
off and splats against the wall, the rest of it
slowly liquefying

3869
02:52:28,770 --> 02:52:30,404
as the rest of the slime is destroyed.

3870
02:52:30,404 --> 02:52:31,139
ASHLEY: Nice.

3871
02:52:31,139 --> 02:52:31,992
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

3872
02:52:31,992 --> 02:52:33,359
LAURA: Yeah.

3873
02:52:33,419 --> 02:52:34,911
TALIESIN: So I'm going to back up against the
wall.

3874
02:52:34,911 --> 02:52:37,595
I'm going to back to the wall of the-- Yeah.

3875
02:52:37,595 --> 02:52:40,054
MATT: Okay. Keyleth.

3876
02:52:40,054 --> 02:52:45,159
MARISHA: Do I have enough speed to get next to Vex
there? 30 feet?

3877
02:52:45,159 --> 02:52:46,841
MATT: Vax, you mean? Yeah, you do.

3878
02:52:46,841 --> 02:52:48,202
MARISHA: Is that Vax?

3879
02:52:48,202 --> 02:52:52,651
All right, once again, I'm going to
Thorn Whip this bitch.

3880
02:52:52,742 --> 02:52:56,481
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for attack.

3881
02:52:56,481 --> 02:52:59,250
LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip.

3882
02:52:59,250 --> 02:53:00,376
MARISHA: 26.

3883
02:53:00,376 --> 02:53:03,395
MATT: That hits, definitely, go ahead and roll
damage.

3884
02:53:03,395 --> 02:53:12,019
LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip, the bitch is dead.

3885
02:53:12,019 --> 02:53:13,536
MARISHA: Eight points of damage.

3886
02:53:13,631 --> 02:53:14,877
MATT: Okay.

3887
02:53:14,946 --> 02:53:16,044
MARISHA: And I pull him--

3888
02:53:16,044 --> 02:53:17,244
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3889
02:53:17,244 --> 02:53:20,226
(all cheer)

3890
02:53:20,226 --> 02:53:24,311
MATT: The creature is slashing about with its
claws.

3891
02:53:24,311 --> 02:53:30,638
MARISHA: So I take my Thorn Whip, and I go (whip
sound). And I grab him. And I see he's still

3892
02:53:30,638 --> 02:53:33,001
struggling. So I take another one and I go (whip
sound) on the other one.

3893
02:53:33,001 --> 02:53:36,949
And I just go Spiderman-style.

3894
02:53:36,949 --> 02:53:40,767
MATT: And (dragging sound). As you do it, it
plummets face-first into the--

3895
02:53:40,767 --> 02:53:42,876
LAURA: Woo!

3896
02:53:42,876 --> 02:53:46,815
MATT: -- both into the magma and the slightly
still-sizzling form left over

3897
02:53:46,815 --> 02:53:48,161
from the ooze that had melted there.

3898
02:53:48,161 --> 02:53:49,178
ORION: Magma and acid.

3899
02:53:49,178 --> 02:53:54,299
MARISHA: And just for flavor, I take a big gust of
air, a big Wind Burst and I go (whoosh) down into

3900
02:53:54,299 --> 02:53:57,611
the lava pool. Encrusting it all.

3901
02:53:57,611 --> 02:54:02,725
MATT: As you do, it slams down. You hear it scream
underneath as its body begins to quiver. The Wind

3902
02:54:02,725 --> 02:54:06,745
Burst hits, and the cool air rushes through the
tunnel. All of your guys' hair and everything gets

3903
02:54:06,816 --> 02:54:08,994
blown back for a second. You have to cover your
eyes, and as you look back--

3904
02:54:08,994 --> 02:54:11,134
(all laugh)

3905
02:54:11,134 --> 02:54:13,037
MATT: The magma has cooled to a solid
rock-covering surface.

3906
02:54:13,037 --> 02:54:15,400
As darkness falls back into the tunnel--

3907
02:54:15,400 --> 02:54:17,266
ORION: Oh, Light!

3908
02:54:17,266 --> 02:54:20,363
MATT: As Tiberius hits Light, in the tunnel you
can see the--

3909
02:54:20,363 --> 02:54:21,427
LAURA: Grog!

3910
02:54:21,427 --> 02:54:25,692
MATT: -- hook horror, which, a portion of its
upper torso is now encrusted

3911
02:54:25,692 --> 02:54:27,503
into the actual cavern floor.

3912
02:54:27,654 --> 02:54:28,434
LAURA: Awesome.

3913
02:54:28,434 --> 02:54:29,239
TRAVIS: Amazing.

3914
02:54:29,239 --> 02:54:30,162
LAURA: Save Grog!

3915
02:54:30,162 --> 02:54:33,374
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over to Grog and Cure
Wounds at fourth level.

3916
02:54:33,374 --> 02:54:34,890
MATT: All right.

3917
02:54:34,890 --> 02:54:36,346
LIAM: You tried to kill us, but you failed.

3918
02:54:36,346 --> 02:54:38,026
LAURA: Don't challenge them.

3919
02:54:38,026 --> 02:54:38,763
ASHLEY: Don't.

3920
02:54:38,763 --> 02:54:39,749
TALIESIN: Nice try.

3921
02:54:39,749 --> 02:54:43,051
ASHLEY: Nice job, guys.

3922
02:54:43,051 --> 02:54:44,493
TRAVIS: I did a pretty decent job, actually.

3923
02:54:44,493 --> 02:54:47,647
MATT: I ate pizza in front of you guys. I don't
care. It was tasty. Thank you.

3924
02:54:47,647 --> 02:54:49,008
ORION: Yeah.

3925
02:54:49,008 --> 02:54:50,551
MARISHA: I don't care. No shame.

3926
02:54:50,551 --> 02:54:58,042
MATT: Delicious pizza.

3927
02:54:58,042 --> 02:55:06,101
LAURA: No. We're not gonna have Trinket this whole
thing. We better get back to Trinket soon.

3928
02:55:06,101 --> 02:55:07,741
I'm freaking out, you guys.

3929
02:55:07,741 --> 02:55:08,741
MARISHA: That's true, if we keep going.

3930
02:55:08,741 --> 02:55:10,021
ASHLEY: 25 points of heal!

3931
02:55:10,021 --> 02:55:10,874
LIAM: Just in seven more weeks.

3932
02:55:10,874 --> 02:55:11,677
TRAVIS: Thank you!

3933
02:55:11,677 --> 02:55:12,576
ASHLEY: You're welcome!

3934
02:55:12,576 --> 02:55:13,502
MARISHA: I might be able to guide him--

3935
02:55:13,502 --> 02:55:14,972
LIAM: Trinket's on the sidelines, man.

3936
02:55:14,972 --> 02:55:16,797
LAURA: That makes me so sad!

3937
02:55:16,797 --> 02:55:17,698
LIAM: We're not going back.

3938
02:55:17,698 --> 02:55:18,722
LAURA: And it's all you guys' fault!

3939
02:55:18,722 --> 02:55:22,431
LIAM: But it was like three years, Trinket was by
your side. This is the first time ever.

3940
02:55:22,431 --> 02:55:24,173
MATT: As Grog, you come to consciousness again--

3941
02:55:24,173 --> 02:55:27,738
TRAVIS: Ah! Did I kill it?

3942
02:55:27,738 --> 02:55:29,706
LAURA: You did, Grog! Good job!

3943
02:55:29,706 --> 02:55:30,799
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog, you killed it good.

3944
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:31,749
LAURA: Also, handful of pizza.

3945
02:55:31,749 --> 02:55:32,937
TRAVIS: I put my hand in my pizza!

3946
02:55:32,937 --> 02:55:34,118
(all laugh)

3947
02:55:34,118 --> 02:55:37,043
LIAM: You killed them all, Grog! You were
magnificent!

3948
02:55:37,043 --> 02:55:37,998
MARISHA: Yay, Grog!

3949
02:55:37,998 --> 02:55:39,837
TRAVIS: Aha! Tell me more! (snores)

3950
02:55:39,837 --> 02:55:42,513
(all laugh)

3951
02:55:42,513 --> 02:55:43,657
ASHLEY: Wait--

3952
02:55:43,657 --> 02:55:44,821
MARISHA: Now we pass out.

3953
02:55:44,821 --> 02:55:46,624
ASHLEY: -- so can I also do a Mass Cure Wounds?
Since I just did a--

3954
02:55:46,624 --> 02:55:48,547
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like!

3955
02:55:48,547 --> 02:55:49,908
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll also do a Mass Cure Wounds.

3956
02:55:49,908 --> 02:55:50,823
LAURA: Yay!

3957
02:55:50,823 --> 02:55:51,925
LIAM: Yes, 'cause I'm at four hit points.

3958
02:55:51,925 --> 02:55:53,182
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're pretty bad.

3959
02:55:53,182 --> 02:55:54,306
MARISHA: Oof.

3960
02:55:54,306 --> 02:55:55,529
LAURA: Brother.

3961
02:55:55,529 --> 02:55:56,521
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

3962
02:55:56,521 --> 02:56:01,033
LIAM: Oh, brother, where art thou?

3963
02:56:01,033 --> 02:56:02,439
ORION: I feel fine!

3964
02:56:02,439 --> 02:56:03,303
LAURA: I feel fine.

3965
02:56:03,303 --> 02:56:04,420
MARISHA: Ah, me too.

3966
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:05,617
TALIESIN: I feel fine.

3967
02:56:05,617 --> 02:56:07,501
LIAM: Oh! Oh! Oh! Fancy you! Blah-blah-blah-blah!

3968
02:56:07,501 --> 02:56:08,303
(all laugh)

3969
02:56:08,303 --> 02:56:10,095
TALIESIN: Seems that there's one table where
everyone is perfectly reasonable!

3970
02:56:10,095 --> 02:56:10,955
ORION: All the time, yes, Vax!

3971
02:56:10,955 --> 02:56:14,178
LIAM: I'm at four hit points! You go fuck 
yourself.

3972
02:56:14,248 --> 02:56:15,515
MARISHA: Yes, everyone on this side of the table's
good.

3973
02:56:15,515 --> 02:56:16,836
ORION: There's an acid guy! Stab.

3974
02:56:16,836 --> 02:56:18,014
(all laugh)

3975
02:56:18,014 --> 02:56:24,503
LIAM: I was trying to save his ass! I was hurting
myself on purpose.

3976
02:56:24,503 --> 02:56:27,479
MATT: All right. So, as you guys steel yourselves
for a moment, kind of

3977
02:56:27,479 --> 02:56:31,901
recovering from that fateful encounter, you--

3978
02:56:31,901 --> 02:56:34,982
ASHLEY: 22 points of healing--

3979
02:56:34,982 --> 02:56:35,892
LAURA: To everyone.

3980
02:56:35,892 --> 02:56:36,804
MATT: To everyone.

3981
02:56:36,804 --> 02:56:37,676
LIAM: That's pretty good.

3982
02:56:37,676 --> 02:56:38,488
MATT: Everyone heals 22 points of damage.

3983
02:56:38,488 --> 02:56:39,354
LIAM: That's half-ish.

3984
02:56:39,354 --> 02:56:40,270
TALIESIN: I reload.

3985
02:56:40,270 --> 02:56:41,584
LAURA: Well done, well done.

3986
02:56:41,584 --> 02:56:42,742
LIAM: Half-ish.

3987
02:56:42,742 --> 02:56:43,963
ASHLEY: Something additional.

3988
02:56:43,963 --> 02:56:44,917
TRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.

3989
02:56:44,917 --> 02:56:46,986
ASHLEY: Oh, you're welcome, Grog! My best pal.

3990
02:56:46,986 --> 02:56:48,825
TRAVIS: Hell yeah. (growling noises)

3991
02:56:48,825 --> 02:56:50,111
ASHLEY: (growling noises)

3992
02:56:50,111 --> 02:56:50,859
MATT: All right.

3993
02:56:50,859 --> 02:56:53,909
(all laugh)

3994
02:56:53,909 --> 02:56:55,288
TRAVIS: It's a language we speak.

3995
02:56:55,288 --> 02:56:57,432
ASHLEY: Yeah, man, it's like our own thing.

3996
02:56:57,432 --> 02:56:59,002
(all laugh)

3997
02:56:59,002 --> 02:57:00,035
MATT: You guys push forward down the tunnel--

3998
02:57:00,035 --> 02:57:00,732
LAURA: Oh!

3999
02:57:00,732 --> 02:57:01,735
LIAM: Yes.

4000
02:57:01,735 --> 02:57:03,828
LAURA: Limping.

4001
02:57:03,828 --> 02:57:05,676
MATT: For another 20 or so minutes, bringing
yourself along,

4002
02:57:05,676 --> 02:57:07,557
sore from the impact of the battle.

4003
02:57:07,557 --> 02:57:08,785
LIAM: I'm burnt.

4004
02:57:08,785 --> 02:57:15,101
MATT: Bits of your armor scarred. By the way, your
armor--

4005
02:57:15,101 --> 02:57:15,966
LIAM: Yes.

4006
02:57:15,966 --> 02:57:16,877
MATT: -- what type of armor was it?

4007
02:57:16,877 --> 02:57:20,714
LIAM: It was-- it's magical. I found it in the
goblin city. Studded leather armor, plus two.

4008
02:57:20,714 --> 02:57:25,903
MATT: All right. For the acidic nature of this--

4009
02:57:25,903 --> 02:57:30,850
LIAM: Wait. Do you know what's funny? What's funny
is, the armor I had before this, that I wasn't

4010
02:57:30,850 --> 02:57:35,334
paying attention to, was acid resistant! Isn't
that funny?

4011
02:57:35,334 --> 02:57:36,412
MARISHA: And now you don't have it no more?

4012
02:57:36,412 --> 02:57:37,328
LIAM: That's so funny!

4013
02:57:37,328 --> 02:57:38,023
LAURA: That's great!

4014
02:57:38,023 --> 02:57:38,781
MATT: Look at that!

4015
02:57:38,781 --> 02:57:39,954
TRAVIS: That's really funny. Keep going.

4016
02:57:39,954 --> 02:57:40,773
MARISHA: That is funny.

4017
02:57:40,773 --> 02:57:41,621
LIAM: It's in my bag!

4018
02:57:41,621 --> 02:57:42,873
MATT: You wipe it off. Thankfully, the magic
enchantment protects the armor entirely.

4019
02:57:42,873 --> 02:57:43,998
LAURA: Ah! See! That was acid-resistant, too!

4020
02:57:43,998 --> 02:57:45,022
MATT: Grog, what armor do you have?

4021
02:57:45,022 --> 02:57:45,904
LIAM: Even better!

4022
02:57:45,904 --> 02:57:47,967
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like hides and leathers and--

4023
02:57:47,967 --> 02:57:48,686
MATT: Just regular hide.

4024
02:57:48,686 --> 02:57:49,801
TRAVIS: Yep.

4025
02:57:49,801 --> 02:57:53,656
MATT: Currently, as you're walking, you look down
and notice that the armor

4026
02:57:53,656 --> 02:57:56,776
on your torso has near-completely dissolved.

4027
02:57:56,776 --> 02:57:57,639
LAURA: (gasps)

4028
02:57:57,639 --> 02:58:00,391
TRAVIS: Son of a-- Well, you're welcome, ladies!

4029
02:58:00,391 --> 02:58:01,504
LAURA: My, my, Grog!

4030
02:58:01,504 --> 02:58:03,146
TRAVIS: (sings) It's time for a show!

4031
02:58:03,146 --> 02:58:04,586
ORION: Grog! Will you put those away!

4032
02:58:04,586 --> 02:58:08,016
MATT: As it stands, you have no additional armor
class bonus for any armor.

4033
02:58:08,016 --> 02:58:08,869
LAURA: Oh no!

4034
02:58:08,869 --> 02:58:10,939
MATT: Your hide armor is gone. It is completely
dissolved.

4035
02:58:10,939 --> 02:58:13,195
LAURA: What about the black armor? Put on the
dwarven black plate armor!

4036
02:58:13,195 --> 02:58:14,452
TRAVIS: They're dwarves.

4037
02:58:14,452 --> 02:58:17,057
ASHLEY: What if we melt it and then make it a big
one?

4038
02:58:17,057 --> 02:58:19,037
LAURA: If it's magical, it might fit you if you
just try it on!

4039
02:58:19,037 --> 02:58:20,107
ASHLEY: I don't know, would that work?

4040
02:58:20,107 --> 02:58:20,911
ORION: It's true!

4041
02:58:20,911 --> 02:58:24,430
LIAM: Hold on, hold on. DM! DM. I take off my
magical armor,

4042
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:26,586
which was dwarven in shape before--

4043
02:58:26,586 --> 02:58:27,573
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, good!

4044
02:58:27,573 --> 02:58:30,890
LIAM: -- but I take it off, it shrinks down to
like a little toddler--

4045
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:32,711
LAURA: Oh! Ew. Cover yourself, Vax!

4046
02:58:32,711 --> 02:58:36,070
LIAM: I'm wearing, like, a Scientology unibody
underwear underneath--

4047
02:58:36,070 --> 02:58:37,150
(all laugh)

4048
02:58:37,150 --> 02:58:37,984
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4049
02:58:37,984 --> 02:58:39,191
ASHLEY: Wouldn't that be-- that's mormons!

4050
02:58:39,191 --> 02:58:40,419
LIAM: The armor shrinks down to like
toddler-size--

4051
02:58:40,419 --> 02:58:41,491
ORION: I don't know what that means!

4052
02:58:41,491 --> 02:58:42,541
LIAM: -- and I hand it to Grog.

4053
02:58:42,541 --> 02:58:43,476
TALIESIN: It's probably for the best.

4054
02:58:43,476 --> 02:58:47,034
LIAM: And I go to my pack and I take out my old
armor, which is acid resistant. Not quite as cool

4055
02:58:47,034 --> 02:58:49,735
as what I was wearing, but I don't want him--

4056
02:58:49,735 --> 02:58:50,977
TRAVIS: You had two pairs of gloves?

4057
02:58:50,977 --> 02:58:52,278
LIAM: I can't-- huh?

4058
02:58:52,278 --> 02:58:53,322
TRAVIS: Kidding. It's Dumb &amp; Dumber.

4059
02:58:53,322 --> 02:58:56,190
LIAM: I can't stare at his pecs for the next three
days, so I'll give him my armor.

4060
02:58:56,190 --> 02:58:57,678
LAURA: I can.

4061
02:58:57,678 --> 02:59:00,505
LIAM: Ooh! And put on what I had on before.

4062
02:59:00,505 --> 02:59:05,624
MATT: All right. So you take a moment, and hand
him new armor, and Grog, this scarred, nearly

4063
02:59:05,624 --> 02:59:09,056
naked goliath form, has been lumbering through
this hallway--

4064
02:59:09,056 --> 02:59:10,345
TRAVIS: Ooh!

4065
02:59:10,345 --> 02:59:11,545
MATT: Hoo! Modesty, Grog!

4066
02:59:11,545 --> 02:59:13,067
(all laugh)

4067
02:59:13,067 --> 02:59:14,277
MATT: You place the studded leather on--

4068
02:59:14,277 --> 02:59:16,227
LIAM: Studded leather armor plus two, okay?

4069
02:59:16,227 --> 02:59:17,480
MATT: So mark that for your AC.

4070
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:18,936
TRAVIS: Studded armor leather plus two.

4071
02:59:18,936 --> 02:59:19,910
ASHLEY: Wait, but then what are--

4072
02:59:19,910 --> 02:59:20,991
LAURA: He's got his own armor.

4073
02:59:20,991 --> 02:59:22,345
LIAM: I've got my old armor. I found that armor
down here.

4074
02:59:22,345 --> 02:59:24,504
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be the person who actually
examines the cart, at this point.

4075
02:59:24,504 --> 02:59:25,535
MATT: Okay.

4076
02:59:25,535 --> 02:59:26,508
MARISHA: Oh! That's a good idea.

4077
02:59:26,508 --> 02:59:27,334
LAURA: Plus we have other plate armor!

4078
02:59:27,334 --> 02:59:28,262
LIAM: That's a loaner.

4079
02:59:28,262 --> 02:59:29,420
TALIESIN: You know, I just figured someone ought
to.

4080
02:59:29,420 --> 02:59:30,616
MARISHA: What the fuck did we open?

4081
02:59:30,616 --> 02:59:31,629
TRAVIS: Plus two to AC?

4082
02:59:31,629 --> 02:59:32,338
LAURA: Yeah.

4083
02:59:32,338 --> 02:59:33,188
TALIESIN: And it should be me.

4084
02:59:33,188 --> 02:59:34,068
MARISHA: Yeah.

4085
02:59:34,068 --> 02:59:35,096
LIAM: No, it's more complicated than that.

4086
02:59:35,096 --> 02:59:36,533
MATT: Okay, here's the circumstance for you, real
fast, before we get to that. So, Grog.

4087
02:59:36,533 --> 02:59:37,388
TRAVIS: Yep.

4088
02:59:37,388 --> 02:59:43,120
MATT: The armor you had on was hide, which was a
dex bonus of 12 plus your dex. Studded leather is

4089
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:46,815
also the same, so your AC actually goes up.

4090
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:50,085
TRAVIS: Oh! Ho! Something that you'd think!

4091
02:59:50,085 --> 02:59:51,563
MATT: So, what was your AC previously?

4092
02:59:51,563 --> 02:59:52,309
TRAVIS: 18?

4093
02:59:52,309 --> 02:59:53,143
MATT: 18?

4094
02:59:53,143 --> 02:59:54,028
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4095
02:59:54,028 --> 02:59:55,296
MATT: It should now be 20.

4096
02:59:55,296 --> 02:59:57,112
TRAVIS: Yay! Yes!

4097
02:59:57,112 --> 02:59:58,213
LAURA: Yay, Grog!

4098
02:59:58,213 --> 02:59:59,847
TRAVIS: Grog takes the top off and does a--

4099
02:59:59,847 --> 03:00:02,180
LIAM: Loaner! Loaner.

4100
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:03,290
TALIESIN: Put it back on.

4101
03:00:03,290 --> 03:00:04,489
LIAM: Loaner.

4102
03:00:04,489 --> 03:00:07,868
LAURA: It's his, he's keeping it. It's going to
stink like Grog, you won't want that back.

4103
03:00:07,868 --> 03:00:10,972
TRAVIS: The things I'm gonna do in this armor,
you're not going to want it back.

4104
03:00:11,139 --> 03:00:15,638
Just give me and Scanlan one night to
break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.

4105
03:00:15,638 --> 03:00:17,559
MATT: Just the two of you?

4106
03:00:17,559 --> 03:00:21,067
TRAVIS: Well, uh, you know what I mean. Who am I
talking to?

4107
03:00:21,067 --> 03:00:27,137
MATT: All right, well, go ahead and roll an
investigation check.

4108
03:00:27,137 --> 03:00:33,193
TALIESIN: An investigation check, what is that?
Eight.

4109
03:00:33,193 --> 03:00:39,348
MATT: Okay. Looking at the cart, the cart is a
rickety wooden thing, but what was in the cart was

4110
03:00:39,348 --> 03:00:46,682
a large glass unit, a containment unit that was
sealed off. You can see the inside of it has

4111
03:00:46,682 --> 03:00:49,917
slight scarring to the glass, but it seems to be
resistant to whatever the loose creature was

4112
03:00:49,917 --> 03:00:54,266
contained in it. Along the inside of the cart, you
notice there are a couple of just left over chunks

4113
03:00:54,266 --> 03:00:59,535
of flesh of different colors, patches or pieces
you see, like part of a hand that's just in there.

4114
03:00:59,535 --> 03:01:00,991
LAURA: Ew.

4115
03:01:00,991 --> 03:01:05,803
MATT: Partially decomposed, to a certain extent.
It looks like these were either used to feed

4116
03:01:05,803 --> 03:01:14,142
whatever the creature was in there or remnants of
some other strange collection. Based on the best

4117
03:01:14,142 --> 03:01:19,850
you guys can ascertain, this creature was part of
the experimentation-type process that the weird

4118
03:01:19,919 --> 03:01:22,232
naga creature you fought earlier came from.

4119
03:01:22,232 --> 03:01:24,311
LAURA: Oh, great, so there could be more.

4120
03:01:24,311 --> 03:01:25,743
TRAVIS: Did we search the ogres?

4121
03:01:25,743 --> 03:01:27,232
LAURA: Yeah! Loot the ogres!

4122
03:01:27,232 --> 03:01:33,035
MATT: Ogres are wearing nasty, nasty, tattered at
this point, hide armor

4123
03:01:33,035 --> 03:01:34,775
LIAM: Grog could do it.

4124
03:01:34,775 --> 03:01:38,474
MATT: They both carry total, amongst the two of
them, about 24 pieces of gold.

4125
03:01:38,474 --> 03:01:39,241
LAURA: Sweet.

4126
03:01:39,241 --> 03:01:40,207
TRAVIS: I wanna take it.

4127
03:01:40,207 --> 03:01:41,369
LAURA: I add it to party funds.

4128
03:01:41,369 --> 03:01:48,504
TRAVIS: I am searching the ogres, and I keep the
24 gold, but I give two to Vax.

4129
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:49,655
LIAM: Thank you.

4130
03:01:49,655 --> 03:01:50,358
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

4131
03:01:50,358 --> 03:01:52,536
MARISHA: Can I go and grab shards of the broken
glass of the case?

4132
03:01:52,536 --> 03:01:56,795
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah. So mark that in your
inventory, you have some hand-sized shards of

4133
03:01:56,795 --> 03:01:58,100
broken glass.

4134
03:01:58,100 --> 03:01:59,339
TRAVIS: And two to Pike for healing me.

4135
03:01:59,339 --> 03:02:00,895
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks.

4136
03:02:00,895 --> 03:02:02,745
MATT: Anything else you guys wish to do in this
section?

4137
03:02:02,817 --> 03:02:09,776
LIAM: So we searched the ogres, that's it. I guess
we should just start walking further down.

4138
03:02:09,776 --> 03:02:12,148
TRAVIS: You take a poo on the black puddle of
acid?

4139
03:02:12,148 --> 03:02:19,319
TALIESIN: I think-- Well, no. That's the only heat
source, that's the only lava there was, and now

4140
03:02:19,319 --> 03:02:20,443
it's cool.

4141
03:02:20,443 --> 03:02:21,256
MATT: And now it has cooled, yeah.

4142
03:02:21,256 --> 03:02:22,240
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind, then.

4143
03:02:22,240 --> 03:02:23,047
MARISHA: Sorry.

4144
03:02:23,047 --> 03:02:24,428
TALIESIN: It's all right, I think it's worth it.

4145
03:02:24,428 --> 03:02:25,558
TRAVIS: I'd like to take a hit dice.

4146
03:02:25,558 --> 03:02:26,665
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and do that. As many as you'd
like.

4147
03:02:26,665 --> 03:02:27,983
LIAM: Let's rest for a half-hour or so.

4148
03:02:27,983 --> 03:02:28,724
LAURA: Yeah.

4149
03:02:28,724 --> 03:02:33,986
MATT: Take a moment, you can spend any hit dice
now that you need to to heal yourself. Just make

4150
03:02:33,986 --> 03:02:39,495
sure to mark how many you've used.

4151
03:02:39,495 --> 03:02:43,843
TALIESIN: I just hear the sounds of ones.

4152
03:02:43,843 --> 03:02:47,642
MATT: All right. As you guys take a moment to heal
yourselves, you pull yourselves back up to your

4153
03:02:47,642 --> 03:02:56,202
feet, and you tread further down this tunnel.
Another 25-30 minutes of the slight curvature, and

4154
03:02:56,202 --> 03:03:01,026
it gets steeper and steeper, until eventually it
opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you.

4155
03:03:01,026 --> 03:03:04,405
You see a large waterfall pouring down from
above--

4156
03:03:04,405 --> 03:03:05,548
ASHLEY: (gasps)

4157
03:03:05,548 --> 03:03:06,871
LAURA: Mother bitches.

4158
03:03:06,871 --> 03:03:08,941
MARISHA: It looped around?

4159
03:03:08,941 --> 03:03:15,382
MATT: You are on the outskirts of where the next
tunnel opens up, where there are a few small

4160
03:03:15,382 --> 03:03:20,312
streams of lava pouring from the ceiling. You look
above, and you can see the top of the downward

4161
03:03:20,312 --> 03:03:23,695
cavern. There's the giant lake beneath. And across
the way, you can see the waterfall where Clarota

4162
03:03:23,695 --> 03:03:25,692
was originally discovered.

4163
03:03:25,692 --> 03:03:26,964
MARISHA: Well, we should go pick up Trinket.

4164
03:03:26,964 --> 03:03:28,091
TALIESIN: At least you get your bear.

4165
03:03:28,091 --> 03:03:29,354
LAURA: (gasps) Trinket!

4166
03:03:29,354 --> 03:03:30,555
MARISHA: Let's go pick up Trinket.

4167
03:03:30,555 --> 03:03:32,062
LAURA: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

4168
03:03:32,062 --> 03:03:34,115
TRAVIS: You're going to get your bear killed.

4169
03:03:34,115 --> 03:03:36,110
LIAM: Can you explain? I don't think I understand.

4170
03:03:36,110 --> 03:03:37,115
MARISHA: We left Trinket over there.

4171
03:03:37,115 --> 03:03:38,281
LIAM: Can you explain with your map, Matt?

4172
03:03:38,281 --> 03:03:38,904
MATT: Yes.

4173
03:03:38,904 --> 03:03:39,711
MARISHA: We're at the bottom of the cave.

4174
03:03:39,711 --> 03:03:40,655
ORION: We went down and just--

4175
03:03:40,655 --> 03:03:42,934
LIAM: I get we doubled back, but it would help the
visual, I think.

4176
03:03:42,934 --> 03:03:45,639
MATT: Yeah so-- and I'll have more of this for you
guys next week.

4177
03:03:45,639 --> 03:03:46,915
TRAVIS: It was a warp tube.

4178
03:03:46,915 --> 03:03:50,787
MATT: The path you guys took was essentially--
lead to this back area, which I'll draw for next

4179
03:03:50,787 --> 03:03:57,660
week, and a tunnel that curved all the way around
and exited right there.

4180
03:03:57,660 --> 03:03:58,720
LAURA: So we're--

4181
03:03:58,720 --> 03:04:01,148
LIAM: All right, we'll go get your bear.

4182
03:04:01,148 --> 03:04:04,150
LAURA: We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go
down the path we should have gone down in the

4183
03:04:04,150 --> 03:04:05,645
first place next week.

4184
03:04:05,645 --> 03:04:06,545
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

4185
03:04:06,545 --> 03:04:07,489
TALIESIN: Except we get Trinket.

4186
03:04:07,489 --> 03:04:08,555
LAURA: But Trinket!

4187
03:04:08,555 --> 03:04:09,510
MARISHA: So it's not useless.

4188
03:04:09,510 --> 03:04:10,906
LAURA: It was absolutely useless.

4189
03:04:10,906 --> 03:04:11,859
LIAM: That's fate, that's kismet.

4190
03:04:11,859 --> 03:04:12,926
MARISHA: Is there, like, any other way down here?

4191
03:04:12,926 --> 03:04:15,834
MATT: Other than the fact you've completely
destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well

4192
03:04:15,834 --> 03:04:22,791
as the one helming the war camp above. You've
acquired new magical items and defeated one of the

4193
03:04:22,791 --> 03:04:26,674
abominations that was created for the siege war. I
think you accomplished quite a few things, though

4194
03:04:26,674 --> 03:04:28,095
maybe not as directly as you were hoping.

4195
03:04:28,095 --> 03:04:29,330
TALIESIN: And we acquired our bear.

4196
03:04:29,330 --> 03:04:30,598
LAURA: We got our bear back.

4197
03:04:30,598 --> 03:04:35,256
MATT: All right, so you, taking the flying carpet,
it's a very precarious journey

4198
03:04:35,256 --> 03:04:38,743
as the weight limit for the carpet--

4199
03:04:38,743 --> 03:04:40,023
LIAM: You go on it, right?

4200
03:04:40,023 --> 03:04:41,796
LAURA: He's with me, and he cast Featherfall.

4201
03:04:41,796 --> 03:04:45,868
MATT: You can go ahead and cast Fly on your bear.
Trinket awkwardly (bear noises) manages to swim

4202
03:04:45,868 --> 03:04:47,637
her way down to the bottom floor.

4203
03:04:47,637 --> 03:04:49,188
LAURA: Come, Trinket, come.

4204
03:04:49,188 --> 03:04:54,950
MATT: As you make your way to the base of the
watery lake, at the bottom, you can see a swish to

4205
03:04:54,950 --> 03:05:01,638
the water, and a very familiar sight briefly shows
itself in the distance. As you see a slick domed

4206
03:05:01,638 --> 03:05:06,988
fish-like head protrude with a few tentacles in
the distance, you all instinctively step quite a

4207
03:05:06,988 --> 03:05:09,622
distance away, and it seems to withdraw back into
the water.

4208
03:05:09,622 --> 03:05:11,879
MARISHA: Can I-- While I see it real quick, I'm
going to go ahead and channel

4209
03:05:11,879 --> 03:05:14,054
and cast Beast Sense through it.

4210
03:05:14,054 --> 03:05:16,893
MATT: Nothing bestial of it. This is not a natural
creature.

4211
03:05:16,893 --> 03:05:18,510
MARISHA: Good to know.

4212
03:05:18,510 --> 03:05:25,570
MATT: Clarota once again whispers to the rest of
you, "Stay at bay. The Aboleth is dangerous."

4213
03:05:25,570 --> 03:05:26,832
LAURA: Aboleth?

4214
03:05:26,832 --> 03:05:28,117
MARISHA: Aboleth.

4215
03:05:28,117 --> 03:05:33,464
MATT: You all step back and turn now into the the
tunnel that extends further into the heart of this

4216
03:05:33,464 --> 03:05:39,724
mountain. You see streams of lava pouring from the
top occasionally, and one central flow of molten

4217
03:05:39,724 --> 03:05:44,960
rock tends to fill half of the cavern, like a
small river heading down into the base of the

4218
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:48,434
mountain. This is very familiar to you, as it's
the path that your dream took you.

4219
03:05:48,434 --> 03:05:50,100
ASHLEY: Guys, this is really familiar to me.

4220
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:51,769
(all laugh)

4221
03:05:51,769 --> 03:05:54,219
LAURA: We spent a whole game doing--

4222
03:05:54,219 --> 03:05:56,150
MARISHA: Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess.

4223
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:58,086
LIAM: I don't know. We were flexing our muscles a
little bit.

4224
03:05:58,086 --> 03:05:59,089
LAURA: Flexing our muscles.

4225
03:05:59,089 --> 03:06:00,192
MARISHA: Yeah, I like it.

4226
03:06:00,192 --> 03:06:01,608
LAURA: Plus you got us new armor out of it.

4227
03:06:01,608 --> 03:06:02,878
TRAVIS: And I got naked, too.

4228
03:06:02,878 --> 03:06:08,338
MATT: As you guys begin to step into the next
lengths of your subterranean journey, we'll pick

4229
03:06:08,338 --> 03:06:12,675
that up next week. Thank you all so much for
tuning into Critical Role.

4230
03:06:12,675 --> 03:06:14,443
LAURA: Man, oh man, oh man.

4231
03:06:14,443 --> 03:06:17,840
MATT: Some tense battles. An intense encounter
choice on you guys' part. Well done on that.

4232
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:19,276
ASHLEY: I want to keep going.

4233
03:06:19,276 --> 03:06:20,780
LIAM: Who's this guy?

4234
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:21,972
MATT: What is this?

4235
03:06:21,972 --> 03:06:27,294
ZAC: All right, so. Amy was the winner of our
first giveaway.

4236
03:06:27,294 --> 03:06:28,394
MATT: Congrats, Amy.

4237
03:06:28,394 --> 03:06:29,690
(all cheer)

4238
03:06:29,690 --> 03:06:31,509
MARISHA: Huzzah.

4239
03:06:31,509 --> 03:06:36,650
ZAC: I ask whoever hasn't signed this, we're going
to pass it around to all sign it for Amy.

4240
03:06:36,854 --> 03:06:37,850
MATT: Awesome, we'll all do that.

4241
03:06:37,850 --> 03:06:40,104
ZAC: As a thank-you for Amy, she's an avid fan.

4242
03:06:40,104 --> 03:06:41,141
LAURA: Yay!

4243
03:06:41,141 --> 03:06:42,315
MATT: Thank you, Amy, that's awesome.

4244
03:06:42,315 --> 03:06:43,258
MARISHA: Thanks for being a fan.

4245
03:06:43,258 --> 03:06:44,159
ASHLEY: Thanks, Amy.

4246
03:06:44,159 --> 03:06:48,562
ZAC: As a personal challenge, guys, from me to
you, I think we are, what are we, 18 away, Lucas?

4247
03:06:48,562 --> 03:06:50,238
LUCAS: 19.

4248
03:06:50,238 --> 03:06:53,167
LAURA: 19?

4249
03:06:53,167 --> 03:06:54,536
MATT: 19 away from our next package?

4250
03:06:54,536 --> 03:06:55,675
ZAC: From the next one.

4251
03:06:55,675 --> 03:06:57,036
LUCAS: Is it at 1,550?

4252
03:06:57,036 --> 03:06:57,878
ZAC: Yeah.

4253
03:06:57,878 --> 03:06:59,802
LUCAS: Oh, we're 29 away.

4254
03:06:59,802 --> 03:07:00,615
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4255
03:07:00,615 --> 03:07:01,501
MATT: Aw.

4256
03:07:01,501 --> 03:07:02,260
ZAC: Are you sure?

4257
03:07:02,260 --> 03:07:03,351
LUCAS: Yeah, we're at 1,521.

4258
03:07:03,351 --> 03:07:07,754
ZAC: Okay, so we've got a little bit of a ways to
go, but I'm going to go ahead and have these guys

4259
03:07:07,754 --> 03:07:13,428
sign this one as well, and I'm going to push you
guys that by the end of tonight, if we reach

4260
03:07:13,428 --> 03:07:18,164
1,550, I'll go ahead and throw this in with the
next promo kit, as well. And if not I'll hang onto

4261
03:07:18,164 --> 03:07:20,037
it for myself, and I won.

4262
03:07:20,037 --> 03:07:21,502
MATT: Boom.

4263
03:07:21,502 --> 03:07:27,503
ZAC: Thank you guys so much. That was fun. It gets
more intense like every week.

4264
03:07:27,503 --> 03:07:30,898
MATT: That's apparently the path this is taking,
so--

4265
03:07:30,898 --> 03:07:32,554
MARISHA: We keep getting knocked unconscious.

4266
03:07:32,554 --> 03:07:34,189
TRAVIS: We make amazing decisions.

4267
03:07:34,189 --> 03:07:36,032
(all laugh)

4268
03:07:36,105 --> 03:07:38,135
ZAC: And just so you guys know, that was the chat
room that decided on your fate.

4269
03:07:38,135 --> 03:07:38,980
LAURA: You?

4270
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:39,946
TRAVIS: Sons of bitches.

4271
03:07:39,946 --> 03:07:41,784
MATT: Yeah, second week in a row.

4272
03:07:41,784 --> 03:07:44,922
TRAVIS: (sings) Why can't we be friends?

4273
03:07:44,922 --> 03:07:48,828
ALL: (sing) Why can't we be friends?

4274
03:07:48,828 --> 03:07:52,991
MATT: So the chat room creature choice, those will
be an occasional thing, not a weekly thing, 'cause

4275
03:07:52,991 --> 03:07:56,745
it's too difficult to keep up with that and a
little too random. Plus that's just too many

4276
03:07:56,745 --> 03:08:00,371
creatures to be prepared for. But every few weeks
or so, I'm gonna throw one out there for you guys.

4277
03:08:00,371 --> 03:08:04,751
So come and watch. Hopefully you'll be there for
one of those episodes. Put your friends together,

4278
03:08:04,751 --> 03:08:09,667
vote for the creature you want to see them fight,
and if a TPK happens, not my fault,

4279
03:08:09,667 --> 03:08:11,209
it's totally on you guys.

4280
03:08:11,209 --> 03:08:14,601
LAURA: Is that a total party kill?

4281
03:08:14,601 --> 03:08:15,530
MATT: Total party kill.

4282
03:08:15,530 --> 03:08:18,737
ZAC: That's intense.

4283
03:08:18,810 --> 03:08:23,231
So, guys, we're not going to go offline
just now. We're going to stick around for a little

4284
03:08:23,504 --> 03:08:27,396
while. We're going to throw it up while
we move some cameras, so I'm going to leave it up

4285
03:08:27,396 --> 03:08:30,995
to the chat room. It's up to you guys, we can
either come back and play some Bloodborne on the

4286
03:08:31,067 --> 03:08:36,139
PS4 that you guys bought us, or we can come back
and play some Just Dance 2014 that you guys also

4287
03:08:36,139 --> 03:08:39,996
bought us. So there's dancing or Bloodborne. It's
up to you guys.

4288
03:08:39,996 --> 03:08:43,262
MATT: Dancing is fun to watch, Bloodborne just to
watch him get really, really angry.

4289
03:08:43,262 --> 03:08:45,642
ZAC: I don't get angry. Lucas gets angry, though.

4290
03:08:45,642 --> 03:08:51,391
MATT: This game, the beginning of this game will
make you angry. All right, all right.

4291
03:08:51,463 --> 03:08:56,244
MARISHA: You don't get angry? Have you played Dark
Souls or Demon Souls? Because--

4292
03:08:56,244 --> 03:08:57,483
ZAC: I think actually--

4293
03:08:57,483 --> 03:09:01,674
MATT: Demon Souls mimics, man, I know the pain
you're in for.

4294
03:09:01,674 --> 03:09:04,682
ZAC: What was it like, Bachee or something like
that? Man, that game pissed me off.

4295
03:09:04,682 --> 03:09:05,677
ORION: Bocce ball?

4296
03:09:05,677 --> 03:09:07,944
ZAC: Wings of-- ire, ear, something like that.

4297
03:09:07,944 --> 03:09:09,029
MATT: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

4298
03:09:09,029 --> 03:09:13,466
ZAC: Man, that was heavy. Would any of you guys be
interested in sticking around to dance a round or

4299
03:09:13,466 --> 03:09:20,292
two if we were to go to Just Dance? It's a nightly
staple here. We end the nights with dancing. I

4300
03:09:20,292 --> 03:09:22,706
don't know if you guys have seen that
ridiculousness, but--

4301
03:09:22,706 --> 03:09:24,303
MATT: Who would want to stick around for that?

4302
03:09:24,303 --> 03:09:26,788
ZAC: They're all shivering in fear, you guys

4303
03:09:26,788 --> 03:09:30,518
LIAM: How soon will that start? I'll stay for 20.

4304
03:09:30,518 --> 03:09:31,879
MATT: We can stay for a little bit.

4305
03:09:31,879 --> 03:09:36,054
ZAC: I bet they're are all going to ask for
dancing now.

4306
03:09:36,127 --> 03:09:37,947
LUCAS: See a lot of Bloodborne, actually.

4307
03:09:38,018 --> 03:09:39,336
ZAC: Oh, really?

4308
03:09:39,336 --> 03:09:40,762
MATT: Oh, I live for Bloodborne, man.

4309
03:09:40,762 --> 03:09:41,172
ZAC: Well, the second--
