NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer. 
I'm a voice actor and the Dungeon Master for Critical Role

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.068
here at Geek &amp; Sundry, and today's wonderful 
topic of GM Tips is curbing murder-hobo behavior

00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:11.146
and running evil campaigns.

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:16.806 line:1
[music]

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:21.718
No matter how much prep you do or how alluring 
the heroics may be, and how strong the call to glory

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:26.407
and justice might prove, sometimes the players 
will give in to the id and become

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:28.217
impulse-driven murder-hobos.

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:31.607
A murder-hobo by the way is a player character 
in a roleplaying game that has no home and

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:34.706
wanders the land killing things and taking 
all the shit off their corpses.

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:40.148
While this style of play can occasionally lead 
to some ridiculously funny scenarios, it can make

00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:46.157
it difficult to maintain a long-form respectful narrative 
for the whole party and for you. However, there are

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:50.217
a number of interesting and fun ways to develop 
great roleplaying and story moments out of these

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:54.767
scenarios that can also possibly curb perpetuating 
such behavior in the future. Now many of these

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:59.582
are written for fantasy games, but these notes 
can be easily tailored to many other genres and settings.

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:04.480
Here's an example. The players get into an argument 
with a merchant and end up stabbing him

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.496
with a sword and killing him. You know 
what I'm talking about; you've seen it happen.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.256
I've seen it happen. I've probably done it. 
In the game.

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:11.616
In the... game.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:15.626 line:1
Now consider the legal ramifications of such an act. 
Will the party now try to hide the body and

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:19.946 line:1
play it off like nothing happened? If so, do they succeed? 
Or is there now a manhunt for a murderer

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.937
within the city and the party is always dancing 
around the rumor whenever it comes up?

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:28.876
Do they begin to see wanted postings with characters 
that look eerily familiar? Does the guard discover

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:33.056
them and attempt to take them in for questioning? 
If they go along, do they stand trial or will they

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:37.420
attempt to break free of prison, leading to a fun prison 
break adventure and leading the party into an

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.158
outlaw-style journey where certain townships 
are best avoided or done incognito.

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:48.056
What if a very powerful investigator is hired 
and finds them, besting the party with his men

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.247
and dragging them to his office where he makes 
them an offer that they have no choice in taking,

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:55.948
one that involves doing an uncouth favor for 
the same investigator? What if a family member

00:01:55.948 --> 00:02:01.377
of the slain hires a seer or a diviner, discovers 
the murderer's face, and hires a bounty hunter

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:05.216
that is now hunting the PC for an ongoing 
period of time, introducing a

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.827
recurring villain to the campaign?

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:11.868
Perhaps they rifle through the slain merchant's 
stuff and they discover he's actually a very terrible person,

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:15.787
like a cultist to Asmodeus and the like, 
perhaps a higher-up within the order,

00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:19.086
and he's likely to be summoned soon 
to a gathering he was leaving for.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:22.498 line:1
Now if they just keep stabbing anything you 
put in front of them, perhaps you should talk to

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:25.557 line:1
the players about respecting the narrative that 
you've worked so hard to construct.

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:30.086
If they still seem negligent to your quest, just quickly 
TPK them with a series of high-level guards and

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:34.796
give them a whole epilogue on justice 
and the rarely noble end of the murderer.

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:39.237 line:1
Mind you, sometimes it can be fun for a group of 
experienced players to communally give in

00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:43.198 line:1
to their dark side and decide to play a campaign 
of morally dubious characters.

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:48.117
Thus can begin the weird and fun experience 
of running an evil campaign.

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:51.017
[evil laugh]

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:52.075
[cartoonish gunshot]

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:55.438 line:1
Now, talk in advance with all the players and 
have them coordinate characters that can have

00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:59.886 line:1
some semblance of working together in collaboration.
Lawful Evil as an alignment works well for this

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:04.278
as respect for structure and rank aid in maintaining 
party cohesion when everyone is being an evil f***.

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:09.600
Now be aware, there are degrees of immorality, 
not all of the same kind of evil, and not all players

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.387
must be evil. A neutral individual among evil companions 
can still serve the same purpose, and one can even

00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:18.637
start as a good character who slowly is corrupted 
by their surrounding companions.

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:23.038
Just check in with what kind of campaign the folks 
want to play out. Is it more serious, dramatic, dark

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:27.616
criminal underground story, or the sillier Saturday 
morning cartoon show villain type story?

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:30.816
Both are a lot of fun but make sure you're 
all on the same page before you get too deep

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:32.187
into the nuts and bolts.

00:03:32.187 --> 00:03:37.877 line:1
Have players consider evil with limits, or a code of conduct. 
It helps when defining your character what their boundaries

00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:40.606 line:1
are and what drove them to the darker side of life.

00:03:40.606 --> 00:03:43.926
Let that internal conflict lead some interested 
inter-party encounters.

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:48.406
Many "evil" folks don't actually righteously consider 
themselves evil at all, only pragmatic.

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:54.027 line:1
As the GM, be prepared for a short campaign. 
Don't write a super extended story arc yet,

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:59.807
let it organically grow from there, if it's even meant to, 
as most evil campaigns end up with PCs

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:03.996
just killing each other. It's part of the nature of the beast.

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:08.184 line:1
Be very clear with your initial discussions 
with the players about the level of mutually-approved

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:12.467 line:1
player versus player possibilities in the game 
should they arise. However, it may develop

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:18.356
into a very interesting long running mafia-like 
story if you run it very carefully and the players are on board.

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:22.567 line:1
Now this is an important one. Make sure 
you and all of your players are clear on what

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:27.360 line:1
elements of evil you are comfortable with, and which 
elements everyone is not comfortable with.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.277
You want to avoid a circumstance where a PC 
eventually pushes things too far and makes it very

00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:36.497
awkward or too dark to continue enjoying the game. 
Define those limits early. If any time a player

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:41.078
begins to push those boundaries, you are allowed 
to as a GM or player to put a pause on it and

00:04:41.078 --> 00:04:42.937
check in with the others, just to be safe.

00:04:42.937 --> 00:04:47.215 line:1
Another cool thing is to consider a plot that enables 
the PCs to work towards a political foothold

00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:51.998
within a town or city. As we well know, evil generally 
flourishes when business, politics,

00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:54.306
and civilization are involved.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:58.833
The glimmer of a promise of power, wealth, servants, 
and spies can entice any player's dark side.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:02.606
You can also play with existing storytelling tropes 
and turn them on their head. You can have the

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:07.947
party encounter upstart adventurers who've hunted 
them down to stop their evil plots. Or have them

00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:12.098
encounter dark entities that offer a chance 
to make dealings with them as opposed to

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:15.705
fighting them. Perhaps the heroes return 
from a grand quest where they save the town

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:20.286
in danger, recovering a great holy artifact, 
and your party is imparted with the mission to

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:25.276
corrupt the artifact, turn the heroes against each other, 
and eventually enslave that very town they saved.

00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:30.445
Eventually, offer up some serious dangers to 
all things good and evil, where the party must

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:36.118
team up with more morally high-grounded interest 
to ensure both sides' survival. This can lead

00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:40.038
to some very cathartic vengeance on those prissy 
paladins when the danger finally passes.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:43.657
Anyway, I hope these tips have been useful to you.
