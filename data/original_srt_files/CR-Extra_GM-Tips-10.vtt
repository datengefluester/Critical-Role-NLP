NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.898
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer.

00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:05.040
I am a voice actor and the Dungeon Master
for Critical Role here at Geek and Sundry,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.649
and today's episode is going to 
go a little deeper in the idea that

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.669
running a game is about improv 
and the unexpected.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.418
Now, running any form of roleplaying game 
puts you in a position where you become

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:22.259
the ringmaster of possibilities!

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.229
You prepared a solid central story, 
a cast of characters, a handful

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:29.840
of possible challenges, and some 
juicy rewards for your clever players.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.039
It isn't until you start that adventure that 
you realize how much of that plan gets jumbled,

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.977
wind-tossed, and sculpted into something 
crazier and often cooler than you initially expected.

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.650
The key to providing such atmosphere 
is being open to let the players take hold

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.081
of their own agency and 
guide the story themselves.

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.669
While it may seem kind of scary 
to follow the unknown,

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:51.669
you can find a level of comfort in 
allowing this to happen while figuring out

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:55.190
how to get back on track-- 
or just following where the rabbit hole goes!

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.319
(pained laugh)

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.858
After you've worked on and 
knocked out your main story thread and throughline,

00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:04.667 line:1
I would recommend taking a little time 
to loosely develop some side plots that may

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.608 line:1
lead back to the main story, possibly.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:10.399 line:1
Here's an example: your main plot involves 
being hired to investigate a local lodge

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.738
of strange activities, leading the party 
to a shore-side wreck-site where

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:17.909
the lodge turns out to be 
a cult plotting a dark ritual.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.080
Now, to the side of the story, you could develop 
a brief element of a drunken fisherman

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.243
who's trying to prove he's not crazy for 
seeing weird things at night by the ocean!

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:29.711
Or you could beat out a plot regarding 
a private collector who's seeking obscure things

00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:35.026
for his collection that 
are actually for this same dark ritual (chuckles).

00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:38.689
Maybe a dancer whose lover was recently 
replaced with a doppelganger who

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.629
is currently working for that same cult.

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:44.670
Now, these are all threads you don't need 
to fully flesh out, and they may never even

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.229
come to fruition, but even just 
having them at the ready will help you

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.400
tie them in should the party deviate 
too far from the main story.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.641
Any that happen to get unused thankfully 
can always be altered or recycled for future sessions.

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:58.477 line:1
I would also recommend developing 
a number of stand-alone NPCs that

00:01:58.477 --> 00:01:59.839 line:1
you can just have at the ready.

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:03.389 line:1
While they may not be important to the story, 
per se, it's always helpful to have a cache

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.599
of colorful characters that you can 
just pluck out of the aether.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.830
Maybe keep some sheets or note cards 
with basic NPC information on them like

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.418
their name, their race, their sex and occupation, 
any special skills they may have,

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:21.289
their disposition to the world at large, 
their personality traits, voice type, goals, fears--

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:22.497
even equipment if you wish.

00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.928
No need to put all these on there, 
but what things you think may be

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.030
interesting and helpful to your story to pull out.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.902
Now, even if none of these NPCs come 
into play during your session,

00:02:30.902 --> 00:02:34.070
they will still be there ready for use 
for most future sessions as well,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.949
so no time is wasted, and you'll honestly 
be thankful that you have the comfort

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.820
of these options at your disposal.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.789 line:1
You can even keep a few stat cards 
with various combat templates for

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.919 line:1
all types of common folk, just in case 
a battle goes down and the party needs help,

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.150
or things go terribly, terribly wrong 
and they end up killing a bunch of people that you wrote...

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.438
Because that's what happens sometimes 
in the game and you're just like,

00:02:55.438 --> 00:03:00.078
"All right, guys, kill them. It's fine, they were important 
at some point... But now I know,

00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:01.919
at least, what they'll do in combat..."

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.608 line:1
You can also create a few traps and encounters 
that can be pulled and plugged into

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:07.349 line:1
your game at any given point in time.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.459
Now, the traps can range from mundane 
shop owners deterring burglars with falling barrels

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.087
and sleep glass to wall-mounted flamethrowers 
and bladed pillars spinning through,

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.219
protecting some sort of underground vault!

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.722
That works too. Encounters that you have 
prepared can be ravaging goblin packs,

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:25.949
a trained protector chimera of a certain location, 
or even just a group of bandits that are

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.711
eliminating witnesses that happen to stumble upon their work.

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:32.830 line:1
Also, it helps to have a list of rewards or items 
tuned to the party's current power level that

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.260 line:1
you can quickly access. Following unexpected 
story threads and directions can lead to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.649
unexpected rewards, and you don't want to stiff 
your PCs because you didn't really plan any loot.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.389
You can quickly come up with 
an appropriate monetary award, and equipment find,

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.288
or some sort of a social boon to 
accompany an improvised PC success.

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:52.570
This might be a little scary, but for the moments 
you really aren't prepared for,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.128 line:1
begin by just painting a scene.

00:03:55.128 --> 00:03:59.399 line:1
When they enter a location you hadn't 
really considered, let your instincts inform

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:04.680
you of what you'd expect to find there and 
describe the impact to your senses as you figure them out.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.776
This includes sight and lighting, the smells 
and sounds you would experience,

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:14.468
the temperature of the very air itself 
are easy gateways to an immersive location,

00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:18.578
and you can just let those details emerge naturally 
as you come up with it.

00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:22.119
Even if you aren't sure where it's going, 
trust that, once the party beings to talk

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.930
amongst themselves, you can probably 
scramble through your previous notes and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.129
prepare to tie it to something you already have.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.030 line:1
Please, you need to take notes!

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.190 line:1
Like, seriously, take notes-- 
you're going to be so thankful you take notes.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.270
Get a scratchpad, take notes, always notes.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.659
Because as you make up elements of the story 
and characters and spontaneous plot hooks,

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.499
you want to write it down to remind you 
of the things you just made up,

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.228
or you'll forget them in the next ten minutes.

00:04:44.228 --> 00:04:45.979
They'll just be gone, and the party will call 
you back and be like,

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.538
"That guy we talked to 30 minutes ago, 
let's go talk to him!" and you'll be like,

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.748
"What-- I... Oh, yeah, I think his name is... Steve?"

00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:54.230
You'll see Steve come up a lot in my games...

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.819
It might not play out within the session right now, 
but you can always flesh out those aspects

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.747
between the games and try to incorporate 
them into the main plot down the road.

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:04.170
You'll be very thankful that you took notes.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.380
Anyway, I hope some of these notes and tips 
have been helpful for you as a GM.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.040

My name is Matthew Mercer, thank you for watching, 
and I'll see you on the Internet.
