NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.397 line:1
MATT: Hello! My name is Matthew Mercer, I am a
voice actor and the Dungeon Master for Geek &amp;

00:00:04.397 --> 00:00:08.977
Sundry's Critical Role, and welcome to my silly
video series on tips and tricks for game masters

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:14.596
and dungeon masters alike. Today we're going to be
discussing a very interesting topic: player and

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:16.456
game master table setting and etiquette.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.537
[trumpet fanfare]

00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:24.946
I have questions often about this, inter-player
and game master or dungeon master relationships,

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:29.187
and dynamics there, and I think this would be a
cool discussion to have. First and foremost,

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:37.037
many RPG campaigns and systems are very different.
Your experience at one table with one GM is going

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.257 line:1
to be wholly different from another, even in the
same system. I think before you start or join a

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:45.487 line:1
game, everyone should be up front and discuss
about the play style. Have the GM talk with the

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:52.864 line:1
players. Is he expecting to create it more RP
heavy, more role playing heavy? Do you want to

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:57.064
make it more combat heavy, more of a balance
between the two? Is it going to be created into

00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:01.882
more of a Diablo style dungeon delve, kill stuff,
get loot, or is it going to be more about

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:07.763
political intrigue, and dealing with the
overarching political climate of a kingdom or a

00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:16.884
space adventure? Is it a very high power campaign?
Is it a low power campaign? Is it a note taking

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:22.302
mystery campaign? These are all the things you
want discuss at the top of creating this game with

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:26.691
your players, so that everyone is on the same page
about expectations. There will be some players

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:30.772
that will be into it for some elements, and others
that will be disappointed if, five sessions in,

00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:34.633
they didn't get at all what they wanted out of
this experience. Being up front about it is a

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.952
really good way for you all to make sure you
understand each other and if you have any

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.854
discussions about those tweaks in the future, at
least you have a basis to build those discussions on.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:51.544
Players, be respectful and appreciative of your
game master and dungeon master. They take a lot of

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:56.690
their free time to create this world and this
experience for you to enjoy, sometimes

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.184 line:1
thanklessly. When you're at the game, when you're
present at the table, best to your ability, listen

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:06.051 line:1
and be attentive, and acquiesce to your game
master's judgement. I'm not saying don't have fun,

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.753
don't forget your snacks and stuff, but for the
most part when you're in the moment, when you're

00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:14.465
in the game, try and pay attention, try not to
distract from the moment at hand and be attentive,

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:19.716
because they put all this time and energy into it,
it's the least you can do. With that said, don't

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:25.704 line:1
be afraid to debate a rule with your game master,
or clarify something they may have forgotten, but

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:30.443 line:1
just remember ultimately the GM does have final
say, and they may alter elements of the system or

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:38.073
of the rules to fit their story, their world, and
that's how it is. Don't get too argumentative on

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:43.323
those aspects. If it really bothers you, you
can take him aside after the game and talk about

00:02:43.323 --> 00:02:46.954
it, and try to come to some sort of an
understanding. Communication is the key, in most

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:49.153
things in life, this definitely being one of
those.

00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:53.964 line:1
Share the spotlight with your party. There will be
moments and stories where your character will

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:59.863 line:1
become the focus, and you will be hoisted into the
center of attention, and that's fine and embrace

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:05.791
that. If it consistently becomes that, and you
begin pushing the rest of your party out of the

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:10.433
way, and you take charge and you want to be the
answer to every solution, it can get a little

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.427
boring. If everyone else is like, "no, you're
cool. You're the leader. You talk. You're the face

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:18.024
man of the group," that's different, but you want
to make sure that you allow the other players to

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:22.113
shine as well. This is a classic rule for stage as
well. You don't want to upstage anyone. You want

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:25.791
to let everyone have their moment in the light,
make sure that everyone has an opportunity to be

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:29.854
part of this story you're all creating together.
If you ever feel like someone in your game is

00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:33.574
doing that, once again, after the game, take them
aside and talk to them. In a very respectful, very

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:36.472
warm way, let them know, "we're starting to feel
you're starting to take the spotlight a little

00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:41.202
away. Just be aware, we want to play too, if
that's cool." Sometimes people do it without

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:45.922
even realizing it. Even just having that
conversation fixes the problem. Not always, and

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:51.753
sometimes when that happens, you know, either the
GM has to step in and have a conversation, and if

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:56.453
it gets really bad, sometimes players have to
leave the game. It happens all the time. But all

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.053
of you are putting your time and attention towards
this, you want to make sure that everyone is at

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:03.043 line:1
least working together to make it as fun as
possible. If it seems that you've unintentionally

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:07.793 line:1
commandeered the game, be open to feedback. Don't
take it personally, don't have a bruise to your

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:12.526 line:1
ego because somebody gave you a note after the
game about being maybe a little too heavy on

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:17.103
taking the game in your own hands. Just listen to
it and say, "okay, I didn't know, I'm sorry. I'll

00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:20.063
be more respectful of that in the future."

00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:29.643
GMs, DMs, also be respectful and appreciative.
Your players are the life's blood of your world. They

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:34.917
are the ones that make this story that you wrote,
and bring it to life, and play it through, and

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:39.882
they hang onto your every word, and theyâ€™re
essentially letting you scoop them up and take

00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:44.413
them into your imagination, and that's a lot of
trust there. Plus they're scheduling their real

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:49.643
life around you and trying to make sure that they
can be part of this experience, so be respectful

00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:53.821 line:1
and appreciative of that aspect, that they're
putting their own side in this as well. Show equal

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:58.863 line:1
attention between players, even if one player
tends to be a heavier role player than the others,

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:02.994 line:1
don't feel like you the just only focus on them.
Some people can start off a little shy, or

00:05:02.994 --> 00:05:07.612
especially if they're new role players, they may
not know how to really engage directly, and so it

00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:14.152
helps to coax them. Have an NPC directly refer to
them and give them patience and let them find a

00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:19.963
voice for their roleplaying character. It may take
some time, but make sure that you're at least

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:23.353
trying to split your attention between the
players, best to your ability.

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:28.593 line:1
Be open to being corrected and to gaining
feedback. You're the game master. You rule the

00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:33.846 line:1
world. You are the god of this whole experience,
but you're not infallible. We all make mistakes. I

00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:40.103
make mistakes constantly. And feedback only helps
you to improve your narrative, to help how you run

00:05:40.103 --> 00:05:44.262
the game, and being corrected sometimes helps you
better understand the rule system that you're

00:05:44.262 --> 00:05:48.613
running. You have a lot in your brain, a lot that
you're constantly having to focus on, and

00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:52.783
remember, and keep notes on, and keep working
together, and working towards long and short

00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:56.613
narratives. You have so much in your head, you're
bound to forget some stuff. Don't be offended

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:59.853
or frustrated if a player corrects you with a rule
or something like that. Be thankful, because that

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:02.682
just means that you probably have a better chance
of remembering it in the future.

00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:07.163
Players, GMs, be respectful of each other. Work
hard and discuss if there's any weirdness going on

00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:11.352
at the table, and work it out to the best of your
ability. Because we're all there to have fun,

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:16.242
we're all there to have a great experience
together, and I think following a lot of these

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:21.473
little guidelines should help maintain that quite
nicely. Thank you so much for watching. I hope

00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:25.542
this has been somewhat helpful for your GMing and
playing experience. You can see more of these

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:28.493
videos on geekandsundry.com and I'll see you
around.
