1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,827
MATT: Hello everyone! Close. Welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:10,387
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons, rolling dice and shit. So

3
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:14,602
welcome! Always awkward. Anyway, before we get
into the game, we're going to do some quick

4
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:18,644
announcements for the evening. First off, we had
our recent 100th episode, and I think we have some

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,818
merch in there. Laura, any updates?

6
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:26,027
LAURA: Oh my gosh, all that crazy merch that we
have! We have those posters, you guys, those

7
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:30,873
amazing David Mack posters that look so pretty.
The signed versions are going to be in the store

8
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:36,026
for one more week, and the non-signed version is
going to be in the store for two more weeks! And

9
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:40,260
that's it, and then they're gone forever. So tell
your friends, tell your buddies,

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,073
tell everyone you know.

11
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:44,429
TRAVIS: Hide your neighbors, hide your wife.

12
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,035
LAURA: That's right. And we also have our Scanlan
concert tees and our Slayer's Cake aprons. Our

13
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:52,745
hats are out of stock, but everything else should
be in there if you guys want to go check it out.

14
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,105
MATT: Fantastic.

15
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,078
LAURA: In the shop at Geekandsundry.com.

16
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:56,935
LIAM: Sold.

17
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:57,839
MARISHA: Word.

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:58,971
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

19
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,202
LAURA: Hey, you're welcome.

20
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:07,707
MATT: That's so sweet. All right, that is that.
Let's see, here else. Just a reminder, the

21
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:12,141
Tal'Dorei campaign guide pre-orders go on sale
mid-July. You can go to the Green Ronin website

22
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:17,254
for info on that, and it will be released
physically bound at Gen Con first, and then it

23
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:21,656
will be coming out weeks after that on the
interwebs. Check out Green Ronin's site for all

24
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:31,036
that information! And we're excited about Gen Con
insanity, so see you guys there. Let's see.

25
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:35,419
Wednesday Club? Mr. Taliesin Jaffe?

26
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:40,091
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've got something special
planned, but I don't know if it's official yet,

27
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:44,508
but I think that we are going to be celebrating
Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I

28
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:47,011
can't say for sure, but we're going to be
talking.

29
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,644
SAM: It's Stan Lee.

30
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,746
TALIESIN: It's Stan Lee. He's coming out on our
show.

31
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,767
LIAM: You heard it here first.

32
00:01:52,767 --> 00:02:00,039
TALIESIN: He and his pansexual adventures
throughout comicdom. Excelsior. It's going to be

33
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,885
fun. It'll be a thing.

34
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:03,593
MATT: Go watch it, true believers!

35
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:04,899
TALIESIN: Possible special guest.

36
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,874
MATT: I love it. Check it out, special guest for
Wednesday Club next week. Awesome.

37
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:08,911
Thank you, Taliesin.

38
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,715
LIAM: Why limit myself to just one?

39
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,437
SAM: That's Gilbert Gottfried?

40
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:23,920
MATT: All right. Also, we have Talks Machina
Tuesdays at seven PM Pacific time here, on Twitch

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,895
and Alpha, to discuss what you'll watch tonight on
this episode.

42
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,237
TRAVIS: Getting turnt.

43
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:35,095
MATT: Yes, that. Thank you, Sam. That's okay. Well
done.

44
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:39,617
TALIESIN: It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't
it?

45
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,700
MARISHA: That's what she said.

46
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:47,189
MATT: And I think that's it. Quick announcements
this evening. Nice and quick. I like it. That

47
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,388
means we get to dive back into the story here,
guys!

48
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:54,631
TALIESIN: Should we mention that we had to reprint
some character sheets, or are we not mentioning

49
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,936
that? I've now said it online.

50
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:01,060
MATT: Yeah! A few characters levelled. We have a
few folks at 18 now, so that's fun.

51
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,530
TALIESIN: Old enough to get in trouble for
drinking.

52
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,247
LAURA: Do you want to make a special
announcement?

53
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:13,387
ASHLEY: So, special announcement about my hair.
No.

54
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:18,383
There's a time jump in Blindspot, so I'm here.

55
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:19,726
SAM: Spoiler!

56
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:21,052
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

57
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:25,925
MARISHA: Do they just assume your character
doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair? Is that

58
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,194
not a thing?

59
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:29,292
LAURA: But they're so pretty!

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,345
ASHLEY: I love them. So much hair!

61
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:36,553
LIAM: Did your character in the time jump go to
the Feywild, or go sailing on the sea?

62
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:43,649
MATT: I'm pretty sure she makes her own bakery
cake store. It's going to be great. It's called

63
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:49,041
the Slayer's Bake. Anyway, guys, I think that's
it, and that being the case, let's go ahead and

64
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,651
hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

65
00:03:53,651 --> 00:05:24,127
[dramatic music]

66
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:28,132
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. So last we
left off--

67
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:32,493
LAURA: Wait, do I put that on my saving throws,
too?

68
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:33,691
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

69
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,714
MATT: Yes.

70
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:38,727
LIAM: We need to share it with the world. Laura
just leveled up, and her attack bonus went down.

71
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:43,578
LAURA: Because I was doing it wrong this whole
time. Yep.

72
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:54,913
MATT: Oh boy. Anyway. Last we left off, Vox
Machina had discovered the existence of a second

73
00:05:54,913 --> 00:06:00,412
ziggurat-like structure on the continent of
Marquet, and apparently a cult of the Whispered

74
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:05,800
One there gathering magical artifacts to toss into
a second darkened black orb, similar to the one

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:14,300
beneath Whitestone, all this time. You ran into
Scanlan once more, and leading you guys to where

76
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,752
this cavern was found in the mountains of
Smouldercrown on the continent of Marquet, you did

77
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:24,787
battle with the cultists there, and seemed to
reveal one of the leaders in that group was none

78
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:32,611
other than the not-dead Delilah Briarwood. She
fended you off, completed their ritual, and some

79
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:38,595
of their surviving cultists fled into the orb
apparently to the other side. You then gathered

80
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:44,958
yourselves, gathered some supplies, your
information, and then proceeded to travel through

81
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:53,793
the orb in Whitestone into the Shadowfell, the
shadow plane, dark mirror to the Prime Material,

82
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:59,564
where you stumbled upon a partially ruined city
that had undergone some sort of ancient siege, and

83
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:06,491
much of it still lies in ruins and disrepair,
where you discovered what seemed to be two other

84
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:13,198
siphon orbs existing around the outskirts of this
forgotten city, leaving threads of magical energy

85
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:21,353
being siphoned and transferred to a singular black
obsidian tower, for whatever purpose the Whispered

86
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:26,617
One, the Undying King, has for this energy. You
began to make your way deeper into the city,

87
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:31,750
masquerading as some undead. In the process you
killed a few cultists wandering the street, and

88
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,722
intimidated one-- Or, I should say, you didn't
intimidate. You killed him, and then asked his

89
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:41,762
corpse. I guess that's a form of intimidation.
Probably one of the most extreme forms of

90
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:51,518
intimidation, really. Discovering that this city
is under the title Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, you

91
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:56,864
don't know too much about it, other than it seems
to be where an ancient battle took place. Much of

92
00:07:56,864 --> 00:08:03,491
the undead that wanders this realm carries
armaments, weapons, and symbols that seem to be of

93
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:12,908
Pelor, the Dawn Father. You also discovered that
there's this tower in the center titled Entropis,

94
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:19,744
where all the magic is being funneled at the
moment. Thus, having found this information,

95
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:26,093
gathered your resolve, you continue your trek
deeper and deeper into the city surrounding the

96
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:31,413
tower Entropis, to discover what your purpose is
here in Thar Amphala.

97
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:36,295
So, Vox Machina, what do you do?

98
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:40,452
LIAM: Figuring it all out.

99
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,114
SAM: Taking five.

100
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:45,522
LAURA: Time out, time out, time out.

101
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,157
ASHLEY: Just hanging out.

102
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:49,583
SAM: So we found out that there's a ritual
happening soon.

103
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,090
LAURA: Yeah, like super stat.

104
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,198
SAM: And there's no day or night here, so who
cares, right?

105
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:56,989
LAURA: Right? It's all just night, all the time.

106
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:04,092
MATT: It's kind of a sunless gray sky. There's
some low light, like a very heavy-- Like a very

107
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,540
dark, thunderous Seattle.

108
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,705
ASHLEY: (singing) Hello Seattle! It's a song.

109
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,775
TRAVIS: What song?

110
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,102
ASHLEY: I think it is.

111
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,250
MATT: It is now. So.

112
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:26,748
SAM: We have to make our way to the big tower,
right? Super fast, and invisibly.

113
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:29,403
Oh, we're also vampire creatures!

114
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,597
LAURA: Oh, we look like the gloom stalkers! No,
those are the flying ones.

115
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:36,470
SAM: We look like miscellaneous vampirey things,
right?

116
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,618
LIAM: Yeah, shambling zombies.

117
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:39,983
LAURA: Scary ghouly creatures.

118
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:43,144
TALIESIN: Extras from a bad zombie video.

119
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,157
TRAVIS: Is Pass Without a Trace still kicking?

120
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,929
SAM: What?

121
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,017
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

122
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,027
MATT: I would say probably because you haven't
cast a spell yet that

123
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:54,174
would've interrupted it, it would be...

124
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:55,982
LAURA: I cast it when we landed here.

125
00:09:55,982 --> 00:10:00,470
MATT: But I don't think you've done anything that
altered that concentration yet.

126
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,732
LAURA: I don't think so. So it's still going?

127
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:06,068
MATT: I think so. For maybe another 30 minutes or
so.

128
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,144
LAURA: Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the
guys that I attacked.

129
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:11,612
TRAVIS: And we've got the smoking thing, right?
What's it called, the censer?

130
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,995
LAURA: Yeah, that thing.

131
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,266
TRAVIS: What is it?

132
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,389
LAURA: The smoky thing.

133
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,867
SAM: The censer.

134
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,187
TRAVIS: Is it called a censer?

135
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,027
MATT: Yes.

136
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,629
TRAVIS: First try!

137
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,635
LIAM: And we learned that it does something, too.

138
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,264
SAM: It protects you from ghouley deads.

139
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:26,050
LIAM: From ghouley deads, specifically.

140
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,616
ASHLEY: Will it protect all of us?

141
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,276
TALIESIN: I think it's got a range.

142
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,399
LAURA: If we stay in this... tight.

143
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,594
ASHLEY: If we stay tight?

144
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:33,565
TALIESIN: Stay tight.

145
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:38,456
SAM: So why don't we just walk through the center
of town, in the middle of the road, with the

146
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:41,391
censer, and walk into the tower? No? Maybe?

147
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,166
LAURA: No. I see nothing wrong with this plan.

148
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,252
SAM: Fly up to the top of the tower?

149
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:48,692
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

150
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,105
TALIESIN: Stay on the ground.

151
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,576
SAM: Teleport somewhere?

152
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,171
LAURA: Do you have that ability?

153
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,637
SAM: She does.

154
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,900
LAURA: There's no trees on the top of the tower.

155
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,824
SAM: Or we can be smoky mist.

156
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:07,111
LAURA: Then it'll take us a minute to not be mist
anymore, and by then they'll realize we're there

157
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:08,542
on the top of the tower.

158
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,466
TRAVIS: Should we take off the robes that they had
and pop it on some of us?

159
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:16,427
LAURA: Sure, why not? I mean, we're undead. We
look like we're undead.

160
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:21,510
TALIESIN: I think they probably know we're here. I
think they probably know we're coming. I think

161
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,434
let's just trepidatiously make our way a little
closer, see what else is in this town, see if

162
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,395
maybe there's anything useful.

163
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:32,186
LIAM: And stay low-key. We don't need to go
marching.

164
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,746
LAURA: Blend in.

165
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:35,655
TALIESIN: Let's not blow anything up yet.

166
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,639
SAM: But we're making our way to the tower.

167
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,521
TALIESIN: Making our way towards the tower, in a
towerly direction.

168
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:41,947
LAURA: Are we at full health?

169
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:44,358
TALIESIN: No. I'm not.

170
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:45,680
LAURA: I'm not either.

171
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,546
ASHLEY: I can help with that.

172
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,778
LAURA: Should we take a 30-minute rest and roll
some hit points?

173
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,871
MARISHA: Did we fight? Oh, no, that's right, we
went down going through.

174
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:01,781
MATT: Yeah, going through the actual portal, the
spinning ball of death caused some damage.

175
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,518
LAURA: I don't know if there's actually time for
that, though, to take.

176
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:09,157
TALIESIN: I'm all right with mine. I'm 20 points
down. I don't mind being 20 points down.

177
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:11,534
SAM: Let's be all full, though. We can be full.

178
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,789
LAURA: We're going to fucking potentially fight
Delilah Briarwood.

179
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,053
SAM: Yeah, let's be full.

180
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:17,762
MARISHA: I'm assuming it's going to take us some
time just to even get there, though, right?

181
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:21,581
LAURA: Is it considered healing as we walk there,
though?

182
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,733
MATT: No, you have to take a rest.

183
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:29,437
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer, then, and
survey the situation, and then take a break. I

184
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:30,912
feel like we're a bit far.

185
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:33,975
LAURA: I just don't know if there's time. If she's
already started a ritual.

186
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,591
TALIESIN: If we run into something on the way
there, though, I don't want to be at peak

187
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:37,842
performance yet.

188
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,276
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

189
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,304
TRAVIS: Let's move.

190
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:42,811
SAM: Oh, God.

191
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,761
MARISHA: Sure.

192
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:44,912
TALIESIN: This is going to be fun.

193
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:46,269
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

194
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:47,635
MATT: You do. For the next 30 minutes or so.

195
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,549
TALIESIN: So let's take advantage of this.

196
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,393
MARISHA: Yeah, let's at least move for 30 more
minutes.

197
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:56,615
TRAVIS: Who's got the censer in the front? Because
we've got to stay together.

198
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:57,941
SAM: Someone in a robe.

199
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,685
LAURA: Oh. Who's in a robe? We're all undead.

200
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,496
MARISHA: Are me and you in robes?

201
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,984
TALIESIN: We can do robes. I'm all right with
robes.

202
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,427
TRAVIS: There's only three of them.

203
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:06,751
TALIESIN: I'll take a robe.

204
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,839
LAURA: I'll take a robe.

205
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,988
MARISHA: You lead with the censer.

206
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,068
TALIESIN: I'll take a robe with the censer.

207
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,096
MATT: Okay, Percy and Vex?

208
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:11,957
LAURA: Yeah.

209
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,492
MATT: Okay. You both throw robes on over your
Seeming-altered undead bodies. Percy, you're

210
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:17,309
carrying the censer?

211
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,504
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm carrying the censer.

212
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,696
MATT: And you're all slowly clustered behind
them?

213
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,636
TALIESIN: Yes.

214
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:21,589
MATT: Okay.

215
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:24,334
MARISHA: (chanting)

216
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,754
TRAVIS: (chanting)

217
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:26,923
TALIESIN: Thank you.

218
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:31,808
MATT: All right. So you guys continue moving,
what's very plainly towards the center of the city

219
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:38,946
as the tower stands as this giant beacon of shadow
in the center of the horizon. The streets are

220
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:44,786
scattered and broken. You can see there was, what
may have seemed almost like a hint of cobblestone

221
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:50,635
at one point, really just looks like largely
broken and shattered badlands and dried stone that

222
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:57,811
seems to have been pummeled by impacts of some
kind, cracked into small pieces. This is a city by

223
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:01,520
function and function alone. There was very little
considered in the beauty of its construction, at

224
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,334
least this far out. As you continue to press
towards the center of the city--

225
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:13,178
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out, just to see if
anybody's noticing. If it seems like people are

226
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:15,587
paying attention to us in a way that they
shouldn't be.

227
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:19,242
MATT: Okay. Well, as you're keeping an eye out, I
would like all of you guys to make a deception

228
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:21,433
roll, with advantage.

229
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:24,079
MARISHA: With advantage?

230
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,384
MATT: Yes.

231
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:32,918
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil.

232
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:37,557
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

233
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,139
SAM: 33.

234
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,922
TALIESIN: 21.

235
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:41,992
MARISHA: 17.

236
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,003
LIAM: 18.

237
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,009
LAURA: 17.

238
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,171
MATT: Pike?

239
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:46,456
ASHLEY: 22.

240
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:47,844
TRAVIS: Eight.

241
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:50,077
LIAM: Too big.

242
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,292
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

243
00:14:52,292 --> 00:15:00,154
MATT: As you guys make your way further down one
of the, not major thoroughfares, but one of the

244
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:06,099
general streets that snakes around towards the
central area of the city, some of you gently

245
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:13,004
moaning and gurgling as you walk, behind you, you have
Grog Frankensteining his way down the street.

246
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:25,471
(laughing)

247
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,188
TRAVIS: Oh man.

248
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:34,168
MATT: The sound of your rendition, that song. As
you're walking, a shadow seems to cross, a large

249
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:40,662
hulking shadow crosses past one of the roads and
turns and begins walking your direction. And you

250
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:47,858
see ahead what looks to be about a ten foot tall,
thick, burly figure of brownish red flesh, torn,

251
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:57,779
and chains and hooks hanging from it. It looks to
be almost like an amalgam of large hobgoblin body

252
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,531
parts that have been sewn and stitched together
with spikes and iron plates, jutting through,

253
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:07,191
keeping it together at the seams. Where there
would be a face, you see instead a giant metal

254
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:12,100
mass that looks like a cage of some kind, and
behind it these two glowing beads of yellow eyes

255
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,282
poking through, and you watch as it just walks in
a straight line (impacts).

256
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:18,694
LAURA: Coming right for us?

257
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,658
MATT: Walking in your direction. Its arms are
curled in front of it like a gorilla, its fingers

258
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:23,568
dragging in the dust below it.

259
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:27,115
LIAM: Does it look like it's just happening in our
direction, or is it coming toward us?

260
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,600
MATT: It's hard to tell. It's about 60 feet up.

261
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,862
LAURA: Is there a road we can turn directions?

262
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:36,209
TALIESIN: Is there a nonchalant way of maintaining
direction but getting out of its way?

263
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:41,663
MATT: There would be enough space to give about a
ten foot berth to it as you put your back against

264
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,975
the side of one of the nearest buildings and let
it pass.

265
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:46,246
MARISHA: Like parting for the queen at the Ren
Faire?

266
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:47,445
MATT: A little bit, yeah.

267
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,433
LIAM: Or Taliesin Jaffe.

268
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:52,550
MARISHA: Or Taliesin Jaffe at any party.

269
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,851
ASHLEY: I move to the side and put my head down.

270
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:57,103
SAM: What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill
us?

271
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,117
LAURA: Kill it.

272
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,315
SAM: Okay.

273
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:00,676
TRAVIS: Same old same old.

274
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:11,098
MATT: (heavy footsteps) You guys all make your way
to the side and you watch. It's autonomous, it's

275
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:18,470
not being brought along with anybody. It's running
a path down the road. You all move off to the

276
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:26,824
side, and as you maneuver to the side of it, it
gets close to the censer you're carrying, and it

277
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:33,403
(groaning) puts its fingers out of the way,
actually crushing some of the stonework on one of

278
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:38,674
the nearby buildings to pull itself aside, trying
to avoid the billowing of the smoke from the

279
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:49,212
censer. It gives a dull, deep resonant (huff) in
your direction as it passes, and then eventually

280
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:54,747
passes by the cluster of you that have all moved
to the side, after its head shifts and scans back

281
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:59,015
in the path that it's walking and it moves past
you, following the direction you just came from.

282
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:02,114
TALIESIN: Way to be Fonzies.

283
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,681
LAURA: Nice. Very nice. So cool.

284
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,970
SAM: Wow. This thing works.

285
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,721
TALIESIN: Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible.

286
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:18,635
MATT: You continue further into the city. You
still hear the distant, low shrieks of the gloom

287
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:28,361
stalkers (shriek) overhead, swooping past in
clusters, circling around. Occasionally you watch

288
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:34,214
one or two swoop down and land on a distant
rooftop, and you hear the crunching of heavy stone

289
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:40,905
and whatever materials were still remaining on the
roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a

290
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:45,178
bit, and then (whoosh) takes off and joins the
rest of its kin.

291
00:18:45,178 --> 00:18:52,057
TALIESIN: Do any of the buildings look remarkable
or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for

292
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:58,691
any building that may have anything inside it of
vague importance. Either the building itself is

293
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:04,069
slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe
someone has boarded something up to try and

294
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:11,294
maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness?
I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary.

295
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:13,291
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

296
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:23,463
TALIESIN: I knew you were going to say that. I'm
not good at this. Nope. Nope, nope. That's a four.

297
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,413
That's a natural one.

298
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:31,978
MATT: A lot of these buildings are hard to tell
apart when they're all just in this state of

299
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,295
disrepair and destruction.

300
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,926
TALIESIN: Some of them have doors.

301
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,344
MATT: Some of them do. Some of them have windows,
kind of.

302
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,511
TALIESIN: Holes where windows might be.

303
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:45,823
MATT: Possibly. Some, you can't tell if it's a
hole, or a window. Or a door?

304
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:47,915
As you press forward.

305
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,993
TALIESIN: I felt Orthax take over again.

306
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:55,980
LIAM: So this is Osgiliath, right? It's wrecked
ruin, no complete buildings, or are any of them?

307
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,104
MATT: You see some further in. The exterior
appears to have been the most heavily sacked.

308
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:08,652
There's been little intent to reconstruct from
this point. Like I said, you're still probably a

309
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:16,300
good mile and a half out from the center of the
city, and as you walk further in, you can see more

310
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:22,729
clusters of skeletons traveling in groups of 12 to
15, somewhat erratically. You've seen some

311
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:27,635
creatures that seem to walk with an intent
pattern, like they have some sort of a sentinel

312
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:32,793
path that they follow to keep watch on the
perimeter or the roads of the city. The skeletons

313
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:39,009
that wander, the undead that you see clattering
about across the dusty, cracked grounds between

314
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:47,168
the buildings, are erratic, uncontrolled. Mostly
it seems to be less intentionally created undead,

315
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:53,907
and more just risen by the nature of the plane you
walk, and haven't bothered anyone yet, or at least

316
00:20:53,907 --> 00:21:01,366
those who live here. As you begin walking forward,
you watch as a cluster of them spills into this T

317
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:04,872
intersection a little ways up, a few of them
falling and tumbling and getting back up

318
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:10,184
(cracking). As they cluster together, some of them
bang into each other. You hear the clattering of

319
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:15,748
metal from the bits of armor that still cling to
their long-rotted forms. Broken bones, some of

320
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:20,667
them are missing arms, or sections of a skull is
exposed and cracked open on the side, where you

321
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:25,937
can see what looks to be some sort of long-dried
and rotted away gray matter was left to slowly

322
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:36,583
collapse like a flan in a cupboard. As you begin
to approach that area, they separate a bit and

323
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:41,957
scatter to fill, almost diffusing in the center of
this intersection, and then they contract, almost

324
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:46,641
like there's a strange hive mind magic that seems
to draw them back together. They're just moving in

325
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:53,303
these autonomous clusters of chaos. You see on
them still, similar to the ones you noticed

326
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:57,721
earlier, some of the armor that they're wearing
appears to be reminiscent to the armor that the

327
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:04,101
black guard that you battled at the ziggurat
earlier had, or similar dark metal, and others

328
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:12,502
have long-destroyed, ruined, scraped and scarred
bits of silver and gold armor that are emblazoned

329
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:17,663
with long-ruined and defaced symbols of the Dawn
Father, Pelor.

330
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:21,157
LAURA: Does it seem like both of those factions
are still--

331
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:22,980
are they clustered in the same groups?

332
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:29,695
MATT: They are. And you get the sense that
whatever battle took place here long ago was

333
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:35,667
probably between these two factions, and those
that were lost in that fray have been risen over

334
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,394
time and wander aimlessly through the streets.

335
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,192
TALIESIN: Free range undead.

336
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:47,866
LIAM: We've seen long-dead people. This is fucking
creepy in the upside-down.

337
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,750
(airplane noise)
SAM: What's going on?

338
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,355
MATT: I called the airport to try and coordinate
this time with you guys. Cost me 17,000 dollars

339
00:22:56,355 --> 00:23:00,435
for that one five-second bit, so enjoy it, guys.

340
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,004
LIAM: Worth it.

341
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:03,521
MATT: Totally worth it.

342
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:09,711
LIAM: These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of
the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older?

343
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:14,092
More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old
these fuckers are?

344
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,470
MATT: You would have to get up close and that
would be a medicine check. Would you want to try

345
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,468
and make your way close enough to one of these
bodies to inspect it enough?

346
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,044
LIAM: How far off are they?

347
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:27,944
MATT: If you guys continue moving forward, you'll
be at that intersection in about 30 seconds.

348
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:29,742
LIAM: I'm not going to go. I'll wait.

349
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,654
ASHLEY: I could go up close with somebody and do a
medicine check.

350
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:36,866
LAURA: Keep up near the thing. Everybody get close
to the censer.

351
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:39,265
TALIESIN: I'll guide us towards something.

352
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:42,852
LIAM: Yeah, no one poking out ahead for this.

353
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,423
LAURA: Hopefully they'll be affected by the
censer.

354
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,922
TRAVIS: Let's just stop by.

355
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:50,279
MATT: So who's moving forward?

356
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,914
LAURA: The whole group. So we can all be with the
wispy smoke.

357
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:59,570
MATT: Okay. So you guys make your way towards this
intersection.

358
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,374
LAURA: We're normal people in robes.

359
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:10,611
MATT: You also watch as you begin to walk further
in that elements of the ground are growing more

360
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:17,088
jagged and craggy. You can see bits of stone and
earth are jutting out in large stone spikes,

361
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:24,500
either through some upheaval or elements of the
tumultuous landscape long ago that just caused

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:33,502
elements of rock to spike outward up five, ten
feet in sections. You watch as you grow close to

363
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:41,977
this intersection, about half of the group all at
once (groan) turns and looks in your direction and

364
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:45,178
begin to (footsteps).

365
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,373
LAURA: Can I just waft some of the smoke towards
them?

366
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:51,693
MATT: Shamble in your direction. The rest of the
group noticing-- You begin blowing the censer

367
00:24:51,693 --> 00:25:03,786
smoke that way. You watch as three of the closest
skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to

368
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:06,546
vaguely lose interest for a brief moment.

369
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:10,010
ASHLEY: Since we're close, can I do a medicine
check? Are we close enough to?

370
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,734
MATT: Yes, but with disadvantage because of the
smoke.

371
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:15,171
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. Okay.

372
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,909
LAURA: You got this, Pike.

373
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:20,589
TALIESIN: Roll like it's a stealth roll.

374
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:28,524
ASHLEY: 13?

375
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:34,890
MATT: With the brief glances you have, it's hard
to really tell. Plus, you're not too familiar with

376
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:43,271
the overall weather of the Shadowfell. You don't
know if there's enough weather to manifest as

377
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:52,029
general decay, or if they've been beaten by the
ravages of time, if it rains here or not. It's

378
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:56,187
hard to tell. You gather it probably doesn't rain
often. They're definitely hundreds of years old.

379
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,068
That's the most you can really tell. They aren't
fresh dead. These are long dead.

380
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:03,587
LIAM: I'm feeling Foresighty. Can I creep up
behind and do the same?

381
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:12,454
MATT: I will say you can do that, however you
still have disadvantage, because she's already

382
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:16,797
taken the roll and you're supplementing her roll
in a very short period of time.

383
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:19,633
LIAM: Would that be an even roll, then, since I
have advantage on everything?

384
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:23,051
MATT: You have advantage on everything. I'm giving
you a chance to do this when normally you would

385
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:27,004
have none, so the Foresight's allowing you to have
a roll with disadvantage. Go for it.

386
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:31,012
LIAM: Oh, that's going to fail. Ooh! 18.

387
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:43,084
MATT: Or not. Getting a glance at the one nearest
to you, the bodies seem to be fairly well

388
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,631
preserved for as long as they've been here, so you
get the sense that there isn't a lot of heavy

389
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:52,228
weather here at all. And given that fact, the
decay that's there, it is reminiscent, maybe not

390
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:59,255
quite as old as the corpse of Purvon when you
discovered the tomb originally, but comparatively

391
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:02,187
ancient. At least over 500 years.

392
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:07,570
TRAVIS: Old Purvon.

393
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,724
MATT: Good old Purvon.

394
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:12,343
LAURA: These skeletons are almost as old as you,
Scanlan.

395
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:15,066
SAM: Good one.

396
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:27,107
MATT: As you continue to walk forward, and the
skeletons part around the cloud of the censer, you

397
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:34,424
push deeper into the city, and they coalesce
behind you and follow. They're keeping a perimeter

398
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:42,050
cluster now. They're still being held at bay by
the wafting of this thick blackish-green smoke

399
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:47,173
that's billowing off of it, but they're staying
just outside of it and slowly shambling at your

400
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:49,078
speed, waiting for an opening.

401
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:54,973
LAURA: I have an idea. What if, right when we get
close to the tower, all of these trailing

402
00:27:54,973 --> 00:28:00,107
skeletons that we have on us, you just Turn
Undead? And then you control them all?

403
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:03,399
SAM: You can do that?

404
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,798
MATT: Destroy them, yeah.

405
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,123
LAURA: Oh, you can't control them? I thought you
could.

406
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,474
ASHLEY: I could turn them.

407
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,122
MATT: Turn them means they just run away
screaming.

408
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,578
ASHLEY: I can make them run away.

409
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:18,134
MATT: You're at a level where you can just make
them explode if they roll low. Up to you.

410
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,573
TRAVIS: We've got a little nuke in our pocket.

411
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:25,731
ASHLEY: I want us to be quiet. I don't want to
make a big spectacle. Because I can make them go

412
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:28,101
boom boom, but let's just wait.

413
00:28:28,101 --> 00:28:29,770
LAURA: She can make them poop.

414
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:35,205
TALIESIN: And they don't even have bowels.

415
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:40,020
TRAVIS: Is anything stalking us from above while
we're moving?

416
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,128
MATT: How astute of you, I was just about to get
to that.

417
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:45,227
TRAVIS: Did you hear that? Astute.

418
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,640
SAM: You put the ass in astute.

419
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,748
LAURA: Hey, did you guys know that Travis is the
smartest guy at the table?

420
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:54,411
MARISHA: I could tell by his Cheers shirt.

421
00:28:54,411 --> 00:29:04,655
(laughing)

422
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:11,903
MATT: So. In the billowing smoke that's coming
around, Grog, because you brought it up, as well

423
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:16,699
as the twins who have relatively high passive
perceptions, and Keyleth as well, actually, you

424
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:22,136
glance up and notice that the erratic patterns
that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky,

425
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:28,442
there's two that seem to be circling, and
circling.

426
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:30,473
ASHLEY: I don't like it, I don't like it.

427
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:37,195
MATT: One of them (shrieks), and you watch as it
goes into a dive in your direction.

428
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,999
SAM: Oh, God! In our direction?

429
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,915
LAURA: Is there a building we can duck into?

430
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:42,714
MATT: Make a quick perception check.

431
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,318
SAM: But quick!

432
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:52,160
LAURA: 33.

433
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,418
LIAM: 24.

434
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:58,532
MATT: Okay. Both of you, really quick, you see in
two different directions, past the intersection on

435
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:02,044
the right, and on the left, you see two buildings
that are mostly still intact. They've sustained

436
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:06,240
some level of damage, but they still have two
solid floors, maybe a partial roof missing, but

437
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,243
they appear to be structurally sound enough to at
least jump into. They both have doors that are

438
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,279
partially ajar and a darkened interior.

439
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,250
LAURA: And a roof.

440
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,154
MATT: And a roof.

441
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:15,389
LIAM: (grunting)

442
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:18,540
LAURA: (grunting) Why am I? I can talk. Go in that
building.

443
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,556
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go in there.

444
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:23,440
LAURA: That way they can't dive bomb us, at
least.

445
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,915
TALIESIN: I go in last. Censer.

446
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:30,004
MATT: All right. So you guys all rush into the
building on the right or the left?

447
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:33,290
TALIESIN: Yours.

448
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,493
LAURA: The right.

449
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:38,328
MATT: All right, so the one that Vex found. You
guys all rush into that building with Percival the

450
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,043
last one in there. As you--

451
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:41,805
LAURA: Weapons drawn in case there's something in
there.

452
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,338
SAM: But also moving like zombies.

453
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:53,970
MATT: Okay. Perfect. So as you guys all rush into
the building, weapons ready,

454
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,302
who's first in the building?

455
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:59,011
LAURA: Me, maybe, because we saw it.

456
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:03,218
MATT: The two of you guys. Both of you roll
perception as you enter the interior of the

457
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:09,088
building. The undead that are clustering behind
you are beginning to gather in a semicircle as

458
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:12,066
soon as you hit the inside of the building, and
they're clustering

459
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,080
at the door as you close it behind you.

460
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,963
LAURA: 20.

461
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,009
LIAM: 24.

462
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,971
MATT: Okay. As you enter the inside, you look
around and you can see what appears to be the

463
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:25,122
remnants of a few tables, very simple tables, that
have been shattered and destroyed, broken into

464
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:29,892
ruin around the area. You see what appear to be
blades, two left in the wall, one broken off, in

465
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:38,801
the center, that have long rusted over time. You
see what appear to be the signs of bodies, blood,

466
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:43,707
dark, dark dried blood circles on the ground, but
no corpses, no bodies.

467
00:31:43,707 --> 00:31:49,383
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the broken tables and
swords to barricade the front windows or holes,

468
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:54,939
I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to
barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam

469
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,174
the door shut.

470
00:31:56,174 --> 00:31:58,894
LAURA: Are there dark corners that anybody could
be hiding in, or another room?

471
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:02,138
MATT: The room itself is pretty damn dark. The
little bit of light that comes in through the

472
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:07,865
distant, broken elements of the wall, there's
enough light where you can kind of-- it's very dim

473
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:11,926
light for you, Percy. Everyone else with
Darkvision is all right to make out the interior.

474
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:14,740
LIAM: Cursory trap check, even though it seems
unlikely.

475
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,102
MATT: Make an investigation check.

476
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,020
LIAM: 19.

477
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,458
MATT: No traps from what you can gather at this
juncture. But you do hear, as you close the door

478
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:27,528
and begin barricading it with Percival, you hear
the multitudes of bony claws, hands, and bits of

479
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:33,537
armor slamming and brushing up against the outer
wall that you just came through. The doors (bang)

480
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:37,291
as the undead have now clustered and are trying to
push their way in. They seem to have a scent.

481
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,850
LAURA: We'll keep the censer near the door.

482
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:48,854
MARISHA: Yeah, I do a little Gust cantrip and put
a little of the censer smoke under the door. I'm

483
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:51,098
like an oscillating fan.

484
00:32:51,098 --> 00:33:03,045
MATT: Druids get pretty cool at 18, guys. Just
saying. Timeless body, oscillating fan. Best wild

485
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,353
shape ability ever.

486
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:06,567
LIAM: Wait till you see the sprinkler system.

487
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:18,071
MATT: So as you're blowing the smoke from the
censer beneath the doorway, it lessens the

488
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:23,368
impacts, but the undead, more than a dozen or so
of these, probably about 15 or 16 of them, have

489
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:28,659
spread out, and they're all clustered at that
side. The little bit of the fumes that you can

490
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:33,048
push beneath the doorway are only reaching a
handful, and it's keeping them from the main door

491
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,009
at the moment.

492
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,412
SAM: Can we see outside at all? Is there a
peephole or anything?

493
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:41,198
MATT: There are no windows at the front of this
building. You see a sliver where it looks like a

494
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:47,952
portion of the wall suffered some sort of an axe
or hatchet impact a long time ago and someone

495
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:51,748
tried to pull their way through. It's maybe about
that wide, and that's where the one source of

496
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:53,349
light is coming through.

497
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:55,071
SAM: I'm going to go over there.

498
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,137
LAURA: Wait.

499
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:58,137
SAM: Oh. Don't do anything?

500
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:05,211
LAURA: I was going to say, what if we turned
ourselves into something else and snuck out, and

501
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:08,518
they would think that we're still in this
building? Anything that was tracking us.

502
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:12,750
SAM: I was going to try to make a little diversion
to draw them away from the door.

503
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,116
MATT: (boom) You guys hear a heavy impact on the
roof above.

504
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:17,515
SAM: I'll do that. I'll do my thing.

505
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:24,482
MATT: You hear (boom) what sounds like really
heavy footfalls along the roof of the building.

506
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:28,190
SAM: I'm going to look through the little sliver
and I'm going to cast--

507
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,357
TALIESIN: Do you want to see what they're burning
in the censer?

508
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:32,514
MARISHA: Yes, I do. That's exactly what I was
going to do.

509
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,004
TALIESIN: I'm going to open up the censer.

510
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,628
MATT: Hold on, just a second.

511
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:43,095
SAM: I'm going to cast Major Image and make a
small little human girl in the middle of the

512
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:51,440
street, crying, bleeding from the arm. She looks
disoriented and she's walking towards the other

513
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,763
building that we spotted, very sad and
(whimpering).

514
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:09,566
MATT: Okay. As you glance through and create this
image, this image appears of this tiny,

515
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:18,250
saucer-eyed French poppet of a girl with a little
dress. Her curls are mussed up.

516
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,298
TRAVIS: Dragging her dolly by one arm.

517
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,765
MATT: It's missing one button eye.

518
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,657
LIAM: You summoned Cosette.

519
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:33,113
MATT: Yes, basically. And she goes running off,
screaming and crying. You guys immediately hear

520
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:39,244
the shift of the undead beyond the door (rumbling)
and begin getting fainter and fainter. As that

521
00:35:39,244 --> 00:35:46,446
happens, you also hear (whoosh). Scanlan, you
glance out and you watch the shadow of one of the

522
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:52,334
gloom stalkers flying overhead swoop down and
attack for the little girl.

523
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:57,721
SAM: Okay, she's going to run. She's going to book
it into that other building to try to get away as

524
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,716
fast as she can. And she can move super fast since
she's not real.

525
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,200
MATT: This is true. This is actually very true.

526
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,351
SAM: She's like the fucking Flash.

527
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:09,380
LIAM: (singing) There is a lady all in white...

528
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:17,203
SAM: 120 feet is all I can move her.

529
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:20,595
LAURA: She's sweeping as she's running towards the
door.

530
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:32,291
MATT: Yeah. You can make her move with an action
120 feet. So the little girl goes from (whimper)

531
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:38,639
to (fast running) and goes into a full sprint in a
really creepy, Ring-style way. That was for you,

532
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:45,618
Travis. Across the way, and you watch as the gloom
stalker swoops up and (impact) slams into the side

533
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:50,635
of the stone building, causing part of it to crush
inward and break. The roof partially (rumbling)

534
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:57,053
has to settle and it falls into itself as the
creature rights itself (shriek). You now have a

535
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:04,628
much closer look at this entity, and it is
billowing black shadow like smoke off of it. You

536
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:08,988
can see glimpses of some sort of physical form in
there, but it's so blurry, it's almost like it's

537
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:15,443
phasing between physical matter and dream. You're
not sure what it's made from, but you can see what

538
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:20,481
looks to be an elongated neck, some sort of
snapping jaw at the end, and two bright,

539
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:27,322
greenish-yellow glowing beacons like eyes at the
front of its face. Its wings don't have skin or

540
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:32,887
flesh, it's just dark smoke, and as it flaps, it
leaves these trails, these curling bits like

541
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:34,557
black, black, black smoke.

542
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:36,547
LIAM: Are we talking dragon size?

543
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:41,048
MATT: It's wyvern sized. It's maybe 20 feet from
wingtip to wingtip.

544
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:43,395
MARISHA: Is it anything like we've ever heard
about?

545
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:48,182
MATT: No, you have not encountered a creature like
this before. But you watch as it glances, and at

546
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,541
this proximity, Scanlan, you're the one who's
getting the view of this, you watch wherever it

547
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:58,406
looks, its eyes seem to emanate these tiny cones
of light, like little flashlights, and as it scans

548
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:05,254
past, the little girl, where the beam goes past,
her body is nothing there.

549
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:10,994
LAURA: Is there another door in this building?

550
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:17,548
MATT: There is on the back side, yes. It's
partially covered by what looks to be debris, and

551
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:22,355
it looks like somebody else barricaded the other
side, but did not seem to cover both ends before

552
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,014
they fell within this building.

553
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:25,225
SAM: Let's get out of here.

554
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:27,253
LAURA: We should go out the other door as fast as
possible.

555
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:29,074
TRAVIS: I'll take care of that barricade.

556
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:31,552
LAURA: But quietly. We don't want them to know
that we're getting out the other side.

557
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:33,302
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can guarantee that.

558
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:34,966
MATT: What are you doing, Grog?

559
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,492
TRAVIS: Moving shit out of the way of the door, in
a...

560
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:39,629
TALIESIN: Medium pace?

561
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:42,167
TRAVIS: Let's call it a medium well.

562
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:46,926
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

563
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:49,341
LIAM: You are a terrible stage mom, by the way.

564
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:52,521
SAM: Well, she died.

565
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:54,442
MATT: She's still there.

566
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,113
SAM: She got her equity card.

567
00:38:56,113 --> 00:39:05,510
MATT: And that's what matters. She's still there,
and you watch, the creature seems confused. The

568
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,509
eye beams move past it, and the little girl's
still there crying and still darting around the

569
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:16,026
area, and the creature's like (snarling), lands on
the ground, and comes up and swipes and bites at

570
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:21,756
her, and it goes through her form. You get the
sense these creatures aren't super intelligent,

571
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:26,847
but they are effective at seeing through certain
glamors.

572
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,428
LAURA: They're going to know that we're not. They
know we're not zombies.

573
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:33,538
LIAM: Is it still after her, or has it given up on
that ghost?

574
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,606
MATT: It's in the process of giving up on that
ghost right now.

575
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,182
LIAM: Still a cat and a flashlight.

576
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:38,549
LAURA: We've got to go.

577
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:39,567
TRAVIS: 21.

578
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:45,073
MATT: At this point, you watch as Grog goes over
with his giant mitts and single-handedly shifts

579
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:49,255
the entire pile over with one shove, exposing the
door there before you.

580
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:50,658
LAURA: Out the door, out the door.

581
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,179
MATT: You open the doorway.

582
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:54,676
SAM: Can we leave anything behind, like a dead
body or something for them to eat?

583
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,141
LAURA: What dead body?

584
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:57,901
SAM: He's got a ton of them in there.

585
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:01,392
LAURA: Actually, yes. Throw a dead body in the
room.

586
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,333
TRAVIS: Who's laughing now, bitches? Dead body!

587
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:10,511
MATT: And like the world's most macabre flower
girl, you produce one of the...

588
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:14,229
TRAVIS: I birth from the Bag of Holding a dead
body.

589
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:20,493
LAURA: And use Dust of Tracelessness as we run out
the door, so they don't follow us.

590
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:21,986
TRAVIS: Who's giving the orders around here?

591
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,250
LAURA: Me. Please?

592
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,493
TRAVIS: Okay.

593
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:32,517
MATT: So as you throw the body behind you, the
door's now being slammed a bit. It seems some of

594
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:36,489
the undead wandered towards that illusion, some
are still on the other side, and now that you've

595
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:41,651
pulled the censer back from it, the other door's
kind of (bangs) coming pushed in. You can see

596
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:46,533
light peeking through. You guys rush out, still
with your Seeming illusion on, and you hear, very

597
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:53,292
loudly, almost omnipresent, the screech, the
(shriek) of the gloom stalker, right around the

598
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:57,859
corner from you, as it begins to take off just on
the other side of the building.

599
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:03,459
LAURA: Should we look for another building we can
duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us?

600
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:06,822
LIAM: Yeah, we can just go hopping from building
to building.

601
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:08,905
MATT: I want everyone to roll a stealth check,
please.

602
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:10,865
MARISHA: Do we still have...

603
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:14,298
MATT: You do. You're getting close to the tail end
of it. You have about five minutes left.

604
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:15,252
LAURA: Natural 20.

605
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:16,313
SAM: Me too.

606
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,537
MATT: Shit.

607
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:19,667
TALIESIN: Thank God we still have a thing.

608
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,848
MATT: So natural 20.

609
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:22,857
TALIESIN: 21.

610
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,225
LAURA: Did you add ten?

611
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,200
TALIESIN: Yeah.

612
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,346
MARISHA: 36.

613
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:27,366
LIAM: 39.

614
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:28,384
TALIESIN: 22, I mean.

615
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:29,712
LAURA: Natural 20.

616
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:30,734
ASHLEY: 22.

617
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:31,764
TRAVIS: 20.

618
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:32,886
MATT: Okay.

619
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,850
TALIESIN: We did not roll well. But we're fine.

620
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,481
MATT: So you all got above a 20. That's good.

621
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,352
SAM: We needed above a 40.

622
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:50,661
MATT: So you guys rush past and, quick glance
around, you find one of the nearby buildings. It's

623
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,614
a little more dilapidated, but it seems to have at
least enough cover where you can all dive into the

624
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:58,503
shadows and seemingly vanish. You all stand there
for a second, and you're super quiet, all

625
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:04,641
breathing heavily (panting), the censer still
billowing this awful, awful fume. It's filling

626
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:09,101
your nose, your eyes are watering instinctually
from the presence. It stings just to get into your

627
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:13,355
sinuses, but you're all enduring it and trying to
be as quiet as possible.

628
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:17,101
LAURA: Is there another door in this building that
we can exit out?

629
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,098
MATT: Make a perception check.

630
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:21,083
TALIESIN: I'm showing Keyleth what's inside the
censer.

631
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,883
MATT: Okay, we'll get to that.

632
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:24,967
LAURA: 19.

633
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:31,200
MATT: 19. It's hard to tell. It looks like where
there may have been a door, a portion of the roof

634
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,762
in here that has also collapsed, it looks like a
giant siege stone, about that big, from a catapult

635
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:41,779
was launched and tore through the roof and
shattered that side of the building. The only way

636
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,510
out is the same way you came in.

637
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,746
LAURA: Fuck.

638
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:51,093
MATT: Unless you climb up and out. But as you open
the censer and look inside, it looks like there is

639
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:59,303
this ember, this cluster of burning, dried herbs.
You're not quite sure what it is or where it came

640
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:02,830
from, but it's currently glowing red in places.

641
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:08,499
TALIESIN: I'm going to give some of the herbs to
Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal?

642
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:15,932
MATT: It has what looks to be charcoal stones in
the bottom clustered around, and these herbs are

643
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:18,651
placed over it, and it's burning and smoldering
over time.

644
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:20,825
MARISHA: Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are?

645
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:22,992
MATT: Make a medicine check. No, this would be a
nature check, sorry.

646
00:43:22,992 --> 00:43:27,330
MARISHA: Thank you. Is this something that I would
get advantage on for my herb book?

647
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,509
MATT: Yes, you would.

648
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:33,975
MARISHA: 28.

649
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:36,485
MATT: Okay. I get to look this up.

650
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:43,134
SAM: Oh, look it up. It's a real thing. Wow.

651
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:59,460
MATT: It's called Wild's Guide. It's a
tobacco-like leaf that was used... It was briefly

652
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:12,883
used for recreational smoking and treatment of
small wounds, but it tended to have a very quick

653
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:19,819
diseased, sickening sense to it. Those that smoked
a lot tended to get sick very quickly, and it went

654
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:26,814
into disuse from there. It's largely considered to
be a relatively useless plant. There isn't a lot

655
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:32,523
of medicinal quality to it. It's just something
that exists in herbalism books,

656
00:44:32,523 --> 00:44:34,286
as things to avoid.

657
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:38,147
TALIESIN: Comes in green and red, available in the
Resident Evil universe.

658
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:46,397
MATT: You get the sense that them using it for the
censer is probably not a widely known use for this

659
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,359
type of plant.

660
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,792
LAURA: You found a new use!

661
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:56,948
MARISHA: I did! I write it down and I press a
flower, or I save some of it. And then can I

662
00:44:56,948 --> 00:45:01,319
Druidcraft some more, now that I know what it is?

663
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:06,588
MATT: From that cluster, I'd say yeah, you can
create a little bit more, but very little bit.

664
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:09,175
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go ahead and make as much as I
can.

665
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:14,158
MATT: Okay, so you spend some time there to focus
on it, and from the remnants there you can make

666
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:18,673
about twice the amount than what was in the
censer, so you have probably a good, solid

667
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:21,019
softball-sized cluster.

668
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,491
TALIESIN: The resin's the best part.

669
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:29,496
MARISHA: Okay. I take half, put half back in the
censer, and give half to Percy. Does anybody else

670
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:34,797
want some? Actually, should we dab ourselves with
it? No, is that weird?

671
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:39,196
LAURA: Maybe just give it to Percy.

672
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,531
MATT: Really? After all that, no dab joke?
Anyway.

673
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,348
SAM: Too classy for us.

674
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:44,982
MATT: I guess so.

675
00:45:44,982 --> 00:45:48,841
TALIESIN: Whatever the opposite of standards are,
I know we have them.

676
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,986
MARISHA: Give some to Percy, anybody else want
some?

677
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:57,752
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any way to make
fire, but I'll take it.

678
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,202
Definitely in my shirt now.

679
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:06,773
MATT: As you guys are doing this, you hear the
(snarling), and you hear the (flapping wings).

680
00:46:06,773 --> 00:46:18,695
It's hunting from building to building. (impacts)
Closer. (flapping wings) (snarling) A little

681
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:26,312
further away. (flapping wings)

682
00:46:26,312 --> 00:46:29,502
LAURA: It's gone? Did it fly away?

683
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:31,424
MATT: Sounds like it, at least.

684
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:36,717
LAURA: Should we leave, and go to another
building?

685
00:46:36,717 --> 00:46:38,037
SAM: Let's keep going.

686
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:40,923
LIAM: Building to building toward the tower?

687
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,063
LAURA: I feel like it's not really gone.

688
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:47,375
LIAM: Well, we'll find out. Let's make a break for
it.

689
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:55,271
MATT: Okay, who's going first? Okay. Vax, as you
dart along the side, glancing up in the air, you

690
00:46:55,271 --> 00:47:01,834
can still see. And it looks like there is some
communication, because where once there was maybe

691
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:07,046
two, you can now see a lot of them have clustered
closer in your direction. There seems to be some

692
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:08,683
sort of an overhead hunt.

693
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:12,579
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us
again? Are we running out of time on it?

694
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,976
MATT: You're getting pretty close, yeah.

695
00:47:13,976 --> 00:47:15,885
LAURA: I'm going to cast it again, just so we
don't.

696
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:18,726
MATT: Okay, so you cast Pass Without a Trace again.

697
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:22,972
LIAM: And are we, Without a Trace and Dust of
Tracelessness? That's just a one time...

698
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,569
LAURA: Dust of Tracelessness is just so they can't
track us.

699
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:32,299
MATT: So the second thing you've gathered, these
creatures are not very intelligent, but they do

700
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:39,818
have some sort of communication between them, and
there apparently is a rush on their end to search

701
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:48,861
for whatever was recently spotted. So as you guys
make your way, following Vax's lead, down some of

702
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:54,961
the alleyways, and begin slithering through the
back ways and the small side streets, avoiding

703
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:58,326
your first attempt to walk straight through the
center of the town.

704
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:02,668
LAURA: It's crazy how that didn't work, though. I
mean, because it was a really smart plan.

705
00:48:02,668 --> 00:48:09,734
MATT: It worked for a bit. Not every plan is going
to hold you to the very end. There was some

706
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:19,412
cleverness to it. So you begin to move through
these buildings before-- It would be Keyleth, Vex

707
00:48:19,412 --> 00:48:28,491
and Vax. You guys come around one small alley and
it opens up into another main road, and this

708
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:34,510
road's hard to avoid. It seems to be almost a
circular central road that marks the outer and

709
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:43,397
inner rings of Thar Amphala. But you see there,
marking right across this road, a 15 foot tall

710
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:50,711
wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of
the town.

711
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:53,000
MARISHA: How thick does it appear to be?

712
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,817
MATT: Make a perception check.

713
00:48:55,817 --> 00:48:59,451
LAURA: Maybe we can go under it.

714
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:06,315
MARISHA: Or through it. 17.

715
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:11,900
MATT: It's hard to tell from this perspective. You
have to get a better glance. You have to find if

716
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:19,626
there was a break in the wall anywhere. You do see
what looks to be some variation in texture a

717
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:25,491
little ways to the right. It could be a gate, it
could be a door, it could be an opening, or it

718
00:49:25,491 --> 00:49:33,255
could be some change in its rather solid, not very
varied exterior.

719
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:38,170
MARISHA: Go to the gate?

720
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,819
SAM: Yeah.

721
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:41,425
MARISHA: Okay.

722
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:50,044
LIAM: Why don't the half-elves go real quick, just
to stay small and quiet. No clanking, no crushing.

723
00:49:50,044 --> 00:49:52,777
You take a look at the wall, and then we just call
everybody up.

724
00:49:52,777 --> 00:49:55,550
Just two seconds if it's the way to go.

725
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,969
LAURA: Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us
you said? Is it farther than that?

726
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,172
MATT: Probably about 60 feet down to the right of
you guys.

727
00:50:02,172 --> 00:50:08,853
LIAM: So the change in the wall's about 60 feet,
but the wall from our hiding spot is

728
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,300
how far away from us?

729
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:16,820
MATT: Across the way it's about 30 feet from you.
it's only about 15 feet tall, it's not crazy big.

730
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:25,197
MARISHA: I'll see if I can discern something here
a little bit better. You go. Go check it out.

731
00:50:25,197 --> 00:50:27,050
LAURA: Sure.

732
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:32,602
MATT: So the two of you dart off to the side,
following Keyleth's impression of where she saw

733
00:50:32,602 --> 00:50:39,273
this shift, and as you make your way along the
edge, you glance over and you see two things. One,

734
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:47,825
there does indeed appear to be a small, cut
doorway in the wall, maybe about six feet up,

735
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:53,303
three feet wide, that's designed for a single file
passage of any creature that wishes to move

736
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:59,355
through. It's open. There's no closed door there.
Above it, just above it, about eight feet up, you

737
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:07,061
see what appears to be a deep cerulean blue
gemstone, about two feet across, that's embedded

738
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:08,901
within the wall.

739
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:11,012
LIAM: I think it's fine.

740
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:12,612
SAM: Just go through the hole.

741
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,164
LIAM: We're good. We found it.

742
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:18,761
MATT: It's a big blue stone, about that big
around. It's embedded

743
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:20,169
into the wall above the door.

744
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:23,082
MARISHA: I ask them, how thick does the wall
appear to be around that side?

745
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:26,757
LIAM: Looking through the door, can we tell how
deep?

746
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:32,610
MATT: Yeah, actually, you can. It's about three
feet wide, four feet wide.

747
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:35,362
LAURA: The depth of the wall?

748
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:38,013
MATT: The depth of the wall, yeah. It's a big,
heavy wall.

749
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:39,872
TRAVIS: Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can
totally make it.

750
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:42,053
LAURA: Good idea, Grog. I'll definitely try it.

751
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:44,275
MARISHA: I can try and Stone Shape through it.

752
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:51,723
MATT: You two... recognize, at least, there's
something very familiar about that stone embedded

753
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:53,210
in the wall.

754
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,175
TRAVIS: It's blue.

755
00:51:55,175 --> 00:52:09,149
MATT: It's definitely blue. It's very similar in
size, installation, and functional placement as

756
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:12,264
the threshold crests that adorn the exterior of
Syngorn.

757
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:18,757
LAURA: Which are definitely used... Wait. To
teleport things?

758
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:24,002
MATT: The ones that are used to transport Syngorn
to the Feywild and back.

759
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:29,357
MARISHA: Oh, weird. Oh no.

760
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:37,567
LAURA: Oh my god, if the ritual finishes, they can
teleport this whole fucking city. Shit.

761
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,012
We have to stop this.

762
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:40,893
MARISHA: What if we dismantle the gems?

763
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,709
TALIESIN: We would probably have to dismantle a
bunch of them.

764
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:47,627
TRAVIS: We're out in the open. Dismantling that's
pretty tough.

765
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:53,664
TALIESIN: I feel like it would be easier to wreck
the operator than try to break the machine.

766
00:52:53,664 --> 00:52:55,194
LAURA: I don't know.

767
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:58,861
SAM: I mean, we've got a guy who crushes rocks all
the time.

768
00:52:58,861 --> 00:53:01,572
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't think it's safe to touch
those things.

769
00:53:01,572 --> 00:53:06,498
LIAM: And the moment he makes a ruckus, the air
squad is coming down on our location immediately.

770
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:10,584
MARISHA: Didn't we take some of that crystal?
Didn't we take some of that?

771
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:12,254
TALIESIN: Which crystal?

772
00:53:12,254 --> 00:53:14,672
MARISHA: Didn't we take shards of it from the
thresholds in Syngorn?

773
00:53:14,672 --> 00:53:17,918
LAURA: I don't remember. I don't have any in my
bag.

774
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:20,522
MARISHA: One of them shattered, and I feel like we
took some.

775
00:53:20,522 --> 00:53:21,763
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did.

776
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:22,753
LAURA: You did?

777
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:24,595
TRAVIS: Yeah, shards of blue crystal.

778
00:53:24,595 --> 00:53:27,822
LAURA: Matt's like, uh...

779
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:32,921
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe it's useful in this
case?

780
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,778
TRAVIS: It's not pretty, it's all broken.

781
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:46,036
LIAM: One question is, if these stones are used to
pull this tower into the main realms, is there

782
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:50,263
another purpose to them here, or is that doorway
safe, is what I'm wondering?

783
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:52,261
LAURA: No, that doorway is in no way safe.

784
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:56,824
MARISHA: Where was the gem embedded in the
doorway?

785
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:59,451
MATT: About eight feet up. About two feet above
the doorway.

786
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:02,159
LIAM: I feel like we should go through the wall or
over it, just on principle.

787
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,432
TALIESIN: We can go over it. We do have a magic
carpet.

788
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:08,059
LAURA: Yeah, and all the flying creatures are
going to see us immediately. We either go under

789
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:13,428
the wall... How far from the wall to the tower is
it? Does it seem?

790
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:14,719
MATT: Probably...

791
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,637
LAURA: Can we see the tower through the doorway?

792
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:22,216
MATT: You can see across, and it's not a straight
shot, but you can get low and you can see where it

793
00:54:22,216 --> 00:54:27,733
breaks. Since you have a good sense of direction,
being the ranger, I'd say you know it's at least

794
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:28,911
under a mile.

795
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:35,070
LAURA: A mile to the tower? So it's probably two
miles wide, this whole...?

796
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:39,756
MATT: Probably less. It's hard to pinpoint
directly from what little you can see, but it's

797
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:44,088
definitely within a mile to a half mile of that
door, that wall.

798
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:47,560
LIAM: Kiki, would you be able to Great Escape us
underneath this wall?

799
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,526
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What if we
go under the ground all the way to the tower?

800
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:54,739
MARISHA: Is it unworked stone? What's the ground
like?

801
00:54:54,739 --> 00:55:03,260
MATT: The ground is unworked stone. It is broken
dirt and earth and stone. From what you gather, at

802
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,415
the very least. A heavy layer of dust.

803
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:11,677
MARISHA: I could attempt to tunnel us there.
Percy, I'm sure you would know more than anyone.

804
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:16,368
What's the likelihood that we might encounter,
that I might bust through a dungeon or something,

805
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:17,636
though, over there?

806
00:55:17,636 --> 00:55:20,389
TALIESIN: That would be the question. It's A,
where do we come up? B, how do we tunnel without

807
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:25,705
collapsing a building on us? And C, what if
there's buried dead

808
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:27,775
that haven't been able to break?

809
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:31,724
MARISHA: I can get us under the wall for sure. I
can do both,

810
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:34,219
it's just figuring out what we want to do.

811
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:37,221
TALIESIN: If we can tunnel under the wall and then
come up in a building.

812
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:40,828
LIAM: I think so. We're not trying to get all the
way there, just past this.

813
00:55:40,828 --> 00:55:42,965
MARISHA: Okay. Can I Stone Shape--

814
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,128
LAURA: From within a building.

815
00:55:45,128 --> 00:55:47,473
MARISHA: -- a crawlspace through the wall?

816
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:51,578
MATT: Yeah, you can probably do that. Let me look
at the Stone Shape spell here real fast.

817
00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:54,981
MARISHA: Big enough for at least Grog to marine
belly through?

818
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:57,815
TRAVIS: We're all undead, so I'm a little smaller
right now, actually.

819
00:55:57,815 --> 00:56:00,063
MATT: Well, you look smaller.

820
00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:01,462
TALIESIN: You look smaller than you are.

821
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:03,141
MATT: You're still your same height.

822
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:06,790
TALIESIN: You would be a little zombie, floating,
stuck.

823
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,681
LAURA: Can we be zombie cows?

824
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:18,253
MATT: Stone Shape is instantaneous, and it's a
section no more than five feet in any dimension,

825
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:22,628
so Stone Shape would be just a one-hit boom. You
could not create a long tunnel.

826
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:26,873
MARISHA: But I can't carve a shape through the
wall to just crawl through, five feet?

827
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:28,165
MATT: Oh, through the actual wall itself?

828
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:32,241
MARISHA: Yeah, through the wall, not under the
ground. I want to bust a crawl space through the

829
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,369
bottom of the wall.

830
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:34,937
LAURA: Don't you think the flying guys will notice
that?

831
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:37,314
MATT: Yeah, that could work. So do you want to do
that?

832
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:41,211
MARISHA: It's not a dynamite blast, it's like a
(rumble).

833
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:42,775
SAM: Yeah, it's just a hole in the wall.

834
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:43,910
TALIESIN: It's like butter.

835
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:45,311
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like butter. So...

836
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,714
MATT: Okay. So you dart across the open road to
the other side, where the wall is.

837
00:56:49,714 --> 00:56:51,009
MARISHA: Cover for me.

838
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:52,069
TRAVIS: How would we do that?

839
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:53,307
TALIESIN: We are stealthed.

840
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:54,410
LAURA: Yeah.

841
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,780
MATT: Okay.

842
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:03,763
LAURA: Can I-- Shit, well, you already rolled. Can
I have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her

843
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:06,355
a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to
see her?

844
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:09,623
MATT: You begin to do so as she runs across the
road.

845
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:11,731
MARISHA: What?

846
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:13,394
LAURA: Just go. Just fucking go.

847
00:57:13,394 --> 00:57:14,500
MARISHA: Okay.

848
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,673
MATT: You hear the distant shrieks, communication
between the various gloom stalkers that (snarling)

849
00:57:19,673 --> 00:57:26,704
echoing in the sky. You make it all the way across
to the wall, and get low, focus, close your eyes,

850
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:38,718
press your hand against the cold, dark wall, and
feel it (whoosh) as immediately, you carve a

851
00:57:38,718 --> 00:57:45,591
circular tunnel through that goes completely to
the other side. Seemingly to no negative effect.

852
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:50,138
MARISHA: Seemingly to no negative effect, I've
made a tunnel.

853
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:53,852
SAM: You sound different. Why are you using weird
words?

854
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:57,804
MARISHA: I'm whispering! I'm just trying to be
more pragmatic.

855
00:57:57,804 --> 00:57:58,832
SAM: Let's go.

856
00:57:58,832 --> 00:58:00,999
LAURA: Hey, guys, we didn't eat a Heroes' Feast
yet, either.

857
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,120
SAM: We didn't heal ourselves.

858
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,363
MARISHA: No, we didn't.

859
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:04,475
TALIESIN: We've got to get through the wall.

860
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:05,685
SAM: Let's get through the wall, and then we'll
heal.

861
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:08,179
MATT: Okay.

862
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:18,355
TRAVIS: He is looking at each one of us and
rolling.

863
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:20,901
TALIESIN: He's making eye contact and rolling a
die, like it means something.

864
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:22,587
LAURA: I'm not going to look at him.

865
00:58:22,587 --> 00:58:24,362
MARISHA: Keeping track. Why is he keeping track?

866
00:58:24,362 --> 00:58:25,862
LIAM: If I don't look, he can't kill me.

867
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:27,314
ASHLEY: If you don't make eye contact.

868
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:29,931
LAURA: It's like in school, if you don't make eye
contact, maybe they won't call on you.

869
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:36,856
MATT: Yeah, it's the old Warner Brothers rule. So
as you guys all, one by one, dart across and leap

870
00:58:36,856 --> 00:58:40,346
beneath the tunnel that Keyleth had created,
Keyleth, have you gone through the tunnel, or are

871
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:41,768
you seeing everyone else through?

872
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,498
MARISHA: I'll wait and see everyone else through,
just in case.

873
00:58:44,498 --> 00:58:46,711
TRAVIS: Oh, how generous of you.

874
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:52,381
LAURA: We all are dead.

875
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:55,310
MATT: You all begin darting through, one after
another.

876
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,162
MARISHA: I'm going to try and keep a lookout.

877
00:58:57,162 --> 00:59:05,391
MATT: Keyleth, you glance up as, at the very tail
end of it, you have Scanlan and Pike at the very

878
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:07,300
end, ready to rush through the tunnel.

879
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,540
SAM: We're slow.

880
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:14,227
MATT: Because of the gnomish feet. They both get
there as you glance up and watch as one of the

881
00:59:14,227 --> 00:59:23,622
gloom stalkers (shriek) and goes into a full
screeching dive towards you outside of the wall.

882
00:59:23,622 --> 00:59:25,309
What are you guys doing?

883
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:27,298
SAM: Hurrying.

884
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:30,309
ASHLEY: Jumping through as fast as our little
gnome feet can take us.

885
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:35,663
MATT: Okay, so Pike, you dart through, Scanlan,
you dart through. With the size of the tunnel,

886
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:38,888
it's easy enough for the both of you to just run
through while crouching as opposed to having to

887
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:43,417
get on your hands and knees, so you guys start
making your way through to the side. Pike, you

888
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:46,273
make it out the other side. Scanlan, you're
halfway through. Keyleth, you're still there,

889
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,223
ready to go in after as it's about to bear down on
you.

890
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,577
MARISHA: It's not coming up?

891
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:54,204
MATT: Oh, no, it's going for a straight dive. It's
going right for you.

892
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:58,653
MARISHA: Oh, god, am I trying to do anything but
get through?

893
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:00,172
LIAM: You're running! Come on!

894
01:00:00,172 --> 01:00:01,711
LAURA: She has to duck down.

895
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:03,312
MARISHA: I don't know, I've got to crawl through!

896
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:05,959
LAURA: Yeah. So do you have protection? Do you
have something you could turn into?

897
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:12,355
MARISHA: Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! I'm going to
see it and immediately Beast Shape into a little

898
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:14,706
mouse and (crawling sounds) through.

899
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:20,542
MATT: I want you to roll an initiative roll to see
whether or not it gets to you in time.

900
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,703
SAM: Am I rolling, too, since I'm half-out?

901
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,079
MATT: You're halfway in the tunnel. It couldn't
fit in the tunnel if it wanted to.

902
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,578
SAM: But, I mean, am I watching this?

903
01:00:26,578 --> 01:00:27,673
MATT: You're watching this.

904
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:29,819
SAM: I'm going to roll. Okay.

905
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:32,123
LIAM: I'm going to say that I didn't leave the
other side of the wall when I realized that she

906
01:00:32,123 --> 01:00:34,767
wasn't coming through. So, waiting right in front
of Scanlan.

907
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,248
MARISHA: 18.

908
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:37,378
SAM: Two for me.

909
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:46,425
MATT: Okay. Natural 19 plus three. So, as you
shift down into the tiny mouse-like form, its

910
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:55,249
claws immediately slam into and sink into the
mouse body. Yeah, that's a 23 to hit.

911
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,776
MARISHA: Yeah. Immediately poof.

912
01:00:57,776 --> 01:01:01,597
MATT: How much hit points does your mouse form
have? Like one?

913
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:04,739
MARISHA: I'm assuming no more than a kitten's
worth.

914
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:11,459
MATT: Right, so yeah. So, we'll say for the
purposes, one. So that would be 16 points of

915
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:16,560
piercing damage, so your form immediately reverts,
its claws now fill with your regular Keyleth form.

916
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,528
You take 15 points of piercing damage, Keyleth,
and you are grappled.

917
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:23,540
MARISHA: Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool story. Cool.

918
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,019
MATT: As soon as it grabs you, it begins to pull
you out of the tunnel

919
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,799
and lift with you in its claws.

920
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:33,152
ASHLEY: Can I grab her arms?

921
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:35,748
MATT: You're on the other side of the wall.
Scanlan's on the other side right now.

922
01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:39,054
LIAM: I'm three feet away from you.

923
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:41,224
LAURA: Yeah, but he's in front of you.

924
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:47,303
MATT: Everyone else on the other side of the wall,
Scanlan in the middle, Keyleth in the front. You

925
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:51,424
saw it shriek and dive down, you don't know what
happened from that point. You can glance down and

926
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:55,909
you watch as Keyleth is being pulled up. You see
that happening. Scanlan, what are you doing?

927
01:01:55,909 --> 01:02:02,270
SAM: I'll yell to the rest: it's got Keyleth. I'll
cast Dominate Monster on it, I guess.

928
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:08,237
MATT: Okay. So, what's the spell DC on that?

929
01:02:08,237 --> 01:02:12,809
SAM: Well, I was probably not fast enough to pull
up my horn, so 20.

930
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:21,976
MATT: That's a natural four plus three. So, as you
say that and turn around, you bring your hand up

931
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:27,320
and begin muttering the incantation and finish it
with a <i>flourish!</i>

932
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,586
SAM: I could have just done that this whole
time?!

933
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:40,131
MATT: As you finish the incantation, you watch as
a small ring of glowing purple-pink glyphs appear

934
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:46,990
like a crown around the outside, floating about
three inches from the gloom stalker's "head." Its

935
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:50,894
shriek goes (intense to calm croaking) and it's
just there, hovering in the air, about ten feet

936
01:02:50,894 --> 01:02:52,339
up, clutching Keyleth.

937
01:02:52,339 --> 01:03:00,978
SAM: All right. Please deposit her on the other
side. Over the wall.

938
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:08,609
MATT: You guys watch as the gloom stalker (wings
flapping) over the wall. Lands on the ground,

939
01:03:08,609 --> 01:03:11,425
slamming Keyleth. It slams you into the ground as
it lands.

940
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:14,271
You take five points of bludgeoning damage.

941
01:03:14,271 --> 01:03:17,226
MARISHA: (wheezing) You could have told it
gently!

942
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,978
SAM: I don't speak Gloom!

943
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:20,931
MARISHA: Five points?

944
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:25,837
MATT: Yes. You (wham) and almost knocks the wind
out of you, and you slam into the hard ground, but

945
01:03:25,837 --> 01:03:27,745
the claws unfurl and leave you.

946
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:30,935
MARISHA: (wheezing) I made it, guys! I'm glad you
made it!

947
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:33,426
SAM: Only 59 more minutes.

948
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:36,782
ASHLEY: Maybe he can tell the others to leave us
alone!

949
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:38,694
MARISHA: Yeah, call them off!

950
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:42,275
TALIESIN: Or maybe there are birds on the other
side of the wall.

951
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:46,078
SAM: Does he keep rerolling for breaking, or is
that it?

952
01:03:46,078 --> 01:03:48,725
MARISHA: Tell them it's handled, we're dead.

953
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,350
TALIESIN: And then we can ride him!

954
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:56,746
LAURA: Ask him if he has any money, and ask him if
he can make a good dinner because I'm hungry.

955
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:58,882
MARISHA: Where's the nearest 7-11?

956
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:04,530
MATT: Each time the target takes damage. It has to
take damage to get the save. So, it's under your

957
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,369
control for an hour or until it takes damage.

958
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:17,794
SAM: All right. First things first, please go tell
your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off.

959
01:04:17,794 --> 01:04:24,523
No more flesh down here. And come back!

960
01:04:24,523 --> 01:04:32,474
MATT: (croaking) You can see that it's landed, its
giant wings have folded under into these folded

961
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:39,034
knuckle-like claws that hit the ground as it
(croaks) and he gets really close and snarls at

962
01:04:39,034 --> 01:04:44,162
you. As it gets close, the air gets colder in its
presence, it's almost like it brings this drop.

963
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:50,639
It's already pretty cold here in the Shadowfell,
but it becomes pretty much freezing as soon as it gets

964
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:57,619
within five feet of you. It seems to suck heat out
of the air. As it's glaring at you, (wings

965
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:04,709
flapping) begins to take up. You can see three
other gloom stalkers who saw it dive earlier are

966
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:12,658
all arriving towards your location. As it rides up
towards them, you hear (gloom stalker speech) and

967
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:18,523
the other ones (gloom stalker speech) snap at it, circle
it and they all have what looks like an argument,

968
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:26,065
if there was. And then, eventually, they break and
they begin shouting off (gloom stalker speech).

969
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:31,521
You watch as the heavy clusters that had been
swarming this area of the town begin to respond in

970
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:36,524
kind. You hear the echoes, the cacophony of
various screeches and screams and they all begin

971
01:05:36,524 --> 01:05:40,613
to slowly dissipate and diffuse amongst the entire
city of Thar Amphala.

972
01:05:40,613 --> 01:05:42,269
TALIESIN: Well, that went well.

973
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:43,465
LAURA: Good job, Scanlan.

974
01:05:43,465 --> 01:05:44,829
LIAM: Welcome back, Scanlan Shorthalt.

975
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:46,065
MARISHA: Thanks, Scanlan!

976
01:05:46,065 --> 01:05:48,985
SAM: It's good to be back. Okay, we'll need a name
for him, obviously.

977
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:50,008
LAURA: Yes.

978
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:52,067
SAM: So, anybody got any ideas?

979
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:53,160
LAURA: Benjamin is what I'm thinking.

980
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,635
SAM: Benjamin is great.

981
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:56,421
MARISHA: Mr. Mistoffelees!

982
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:58,165
SAM: That's way better.

983
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:00,664
(laughing)

984
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:03,584
TALIESIN: Can we ride him to the tower?

985
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:10,914
SAM: Well, some of us can, right? By looking at
him, how much can he carry? Or she!

986
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:20,220
MATT: You're not certain, based on its size, it
could maybe carry three medium to small people.

987
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,639
SAM: Okay.

988
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:24,024
MARISHA: (whispered) What's around us right now?

989
01:06:24,024 --> 01:06:25,684
(regular volume) Sorry, what's around us right
now?

990
01:06:25,684 --> 01:06:30,713
MATT: So, as you glance around the other side of the
wall, the city is denser within this inner

991
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:43,280
cloister, and the buildings all seem to be newer.
Or repaired. It seems like this inner sanctum of

992
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:50,693
Thar Amphala has garnished most of the attention
of those that currently reside within its space.

993
01:06:50,693 --> 01:06:59,302
As you are glancing up, too, you see the flicker,
the faint flicker of the conjoining strands of

994
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:05,718
magical energy that are rising up to the pinnacle
of the tower of Entropis where you see these three

995
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:11,458
heavy claw-like fingers that jut out of the top of
the tower all curve inward. The flash is in the

996
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:20,207
center of it, it's just glowing brighter and
brighter. That pulsing is (pulsing). It's almost

997
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:27,907
like seeing this heartbeat of pure energy that's
swelling and swelling.

998
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:30,555
LAURA: I don't think we have time to stop.

999
01:07:30,555 --> 01:07:38,824
SAM: Well, so no more healing. But we could fly
right up there and break that thing.

1000
01:07:38,824 --> 01:07:42,190
MARISHA: Do we really not want to do any other
healing?

1001
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:49,467
LAURA: Pike can heal us, but we can't rest.
There's no time for a rest. No time for a Heroes'

1002
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:51,811
Feast. I bought those <i>fucking</i> chalices.

1003
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:53,614
TALIESIN: Next time.

1004
01:07:53,614 --> 01:07:55,773
MARISHA: Might still be useful.

1005
01:07:55,773 --> 01:07:57,418
ASHLEY: How long does Heroes' Feast take?

1006
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:59,004
SAM: Like an hour or something.

1007
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:00,667
TALIESIN: It will hardly matter.

1008
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,468
ASHLEY: We can't just take an hour?

1009
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:06,255
LAURA: I think that thing is like, going to go.

1010
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:11,790
MATT: It's up to you guys. It's a gradual. It's
not like all of a sudden, right now, you watched

1011
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:17,298
it pulse. As you've been getting towards, you've
been watching it slowly swell. So, who knows.

1012
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:22,150
SAM: Some of us could get on Mr. Mistoffelees and
fly around the tower and see if there's a window

1013
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:23,853
that we could bust in or something.

1014
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:28,553
LAURA: I wonder if Delilah's on the top of the
tower.

1015
01:08:28,553 --> 01:08:31,962
SAM: Yeah, but we'll be on a thing, so maybe we
won't be very conspicuous.

1016
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:36,074
TALIESIN: Actually, maybe if we ask Mr.
Mistoffelees-- I'm going to never get tired of

1017
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:40,791
saying that!-- to go up to the tower, greet
whoever's up there, and throw them off.

1018
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,962
SAM: It's just a pulsing orb of doom, isn't it?

1019
01:08:43,962 --> 01:08:47,808
TALIESIN: Just go up there and cause havoc.

1020
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:50,765
SAM: One of us needs to see what's up there.

1021
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:54,661
TALIESIN: No, we can just send him up there, and
then we can head in through the tower. He can just

1022
01:08:54,661 --> 01:08:55,952
be a problem.

1023
01:08:55,952 --> 01:09:01,210
SAM: He's dumb! What if comes back and he's like
'I don't know!'?

1024
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:05,077
TALIESIN: Just say, go up there and if there's
anything living up there, throw it off.

1025
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:10,922
SAM: Can't one of us go up there with him to scout
it out? Yeah, if someone's invisible. Can't you

1026
01:09:10,922 --> 01:09:12,380
all be invisible?

1027
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,679
TALIESIN: Yes, all of us.

1028
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:14,611
SAM: Just me.

1029
01:09:14,611 --> 01:09:16,260
TALIESIN: Yes, it's just you.

1030
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,657
LAURA: Can't you make all of us invisible?

1031
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:19,982
SAM: Not while I'm concentrating on Mr.
Mistoffelees!

1032
01:09:19,982 --> 01:09:22,086
(laughter)

1033
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:29,322
TALIESIN: I say we head in closer on foot. If you
want to ride Mr. Mistoffelees up to the top of the

1034
01:09:29,322 --> 01:09:31,364
tower, that's one thing. But I think just sending
him up there,

1035
01:09:31,364 --> 01:09:33,407
or sending him to be an agent of chaos.

1036
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:37,807
LIAM: I could probably ride him, and if shit goes
south, I could get away.

1037
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:39,550
TALIESIN: You could always get swallowed.

1038
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,349
LIAM: By Mr. Mistoffelees?

1039
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:42,971
LAURA: By anything.

1040
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:46,356
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression we're
going to have options before this day is over.

1041
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:52,993
MARISHA: I feel like we're going to have to do a
lot of things to stop this.

1042
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,391
SAM: We need to get into the tower! We don't even
know how to do that!

1043
01:09:56,391 --> 01:10:00,875
LIAM: We don't know what we're talking about,
which is why I think the idea to go scope it out

1044
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,150
is a good one.

1045
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:06,313
LAURA: Does it look like there's any windows on
the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower?

1046
01:10:06,313 --> 01:10:07,655
MATT: Make a perception check.

1047
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:09,598
LAURA: Okay.

1048
01:10:09,598 --> 01:10:11,092
SAM: Nope!

1049
01:10:11,092 --> 01:10:12,652
LAURA: Well, hold on. 19.

1050
01:10:12,652 --> 01:10:20,562
MATT: 19, still pretty good. Not a single window.
It's a solid tower.

1051
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:23,013
ASHLEY: Are there any doors? No windows?

1052
01:10:23,013 --> 01:10:28,500
MATT: You can't tell from your perspective right
now. The base is currently obscured by the very,

1053
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,861
very dense buildings.

1054
01:10:29,861 --> 01:10:31,452
LAURA: Ultimate challenge for Vox Machina.

1055
01:10:31,452 --> 01:10:34,586
TRAVIS: Should we check one of the buildings, and
then we can figure out who wants to go check it

1056
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:36,567
out, so we can get out of the open?

1057
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:38,304
LAURA: Yeah, let's get in a building and hide!

1058
01:10:38,304 --> 01:10:40,089
TRAVIS: Because he's a cleaner!

1059
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:45,554
LIAM: The tower, is it obscured by all this shit
happening on top of it? Vex can see there's no

1060
01:10:45,554 --> 01:10:48,772
windows; can we see if there's a rooftop to it at
all?

1061
01:10:48,772 --> 01:10:50,292
MATT: There is a top to the tower.

1062
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,151
LIAM: Is it this, is it this, or can we not see?

1063
01:10:53,151 --> 01:11:00,260
MATT: The tower gently tapers and then comes to an
end. There is a top. You see there's three giant,

1064
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:08,709
curled finger-like black spires that curl inward
on the outside, inward. And then there's the

1065
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:14,029
platform where the tower stops, where it seems
like there would be somewhere to stand.

1066
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:17,566
LAURA: The thing that's glowing is off of the
ground of the tower?

1067
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:20,797
MATT: It's filling up the entirety of that space
between the fingers

1068
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,782
on the actual roof of the tower.

1069
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:27,160
MARISHA: What if it has to keep expanding all the
way to the crystals?

1070
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:36,576
TRAVIS: What's the nearest building? Is there one
building that's closest to

1071
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:38,207
where we came through the tunnel?

1072
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:40,157
MATT: Yeah, you guys are about ten feet from the
nearest building.

1073
01:11:40,157 --> 01:11:41,681
TRAVIS: Can I walk over? Are there any windows?

1074
01:11:41,681 --> 01:11:44,025
MATT: This building does not have any windows.

1075
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:45,172
TRAVIS: Does it have a door?

1076
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,199
MATT: It does.

1077
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,409
TRAVIS: Can I knock?

1078
01:11:47,409 --> 01:12:00,374
MATT: (knocking) You watch as an older gentleman
with a very thin gray goatee, looks a little

1079
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:05,402
sallow, missing his left eye, he currently has a
small sack over his shoulder, he opens the door.

1080
01:12:05,402 --> 01:12:06,874
"Can I--"

1081
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:08,504
TRAVIS: Hey, come here! And I grab his face.

1082
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,303
MATT: (muffled yelling)

1083
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:12,368
LAURA: Inside! Inside!

1084
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:13,940
TRAVIS: We just go in. Push in.

1085
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,247
TALIESIN: Well, we're going in now, aren't we?

1086
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,262
LIAM: And we're walking, and we're walking.

1087
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:25,062
SAM: I'll tell Mr. Mistoffelees to do a 90-second
loop and come back down and check in on us because

1088
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:26,716
he can't fit in the door, right?

1089
01:12:26,716 --> 01:12:27,723
MATT: No!

1090
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,592
SAM: Fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down.

1091
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:38,867
MATT: He does a small circle as you guys all rush
into the building. You enter the inside. You see

1092
01:12:38,867 --> 01:12:45,818
what looks to be a lot of building materials. It
looks like some of the outer buildings here were

1093
01:12:45,818 --> 01:12:52,174
used as the storage facilities for what a lot of
the city was rebuilt as. There's nobody else

1094
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:56,889
inside right now. This gentleman looks like he was
on his way out of the building as you interrupted

1095
01:12:56,889 --> 01:13:07,255
him. As now most of his head is just clasped by
your giant goliath Titanstone Knuckle-adorned

1096
01:13:07,255 --> 01:13:13,794
hand, you see a little bit of his eye peeking over
Grog's, and he's like (muffled yelling).

1097
01:13:13,794 --> 01:13:15,514
TRAVIS: Shh.

1098
01:13:15,514 --> 01:13:20,215
MATT: You see he's got the heavy male pattern--
looks like the old D&D Dungeon Master from the

1099
01:13:20,215 --> 01:13:25,783
cartoon. He's bald on top, has long gray hair that
goes past his shoulders. Very thin, missing the

1100
01:13:25,783 --> 01:13:30,983
left eye, and he's just limp. He's not even going to
fight it.

1101
01:13:30,983 --> 01:13:35,545
LAURA: Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah
Briarwood. You may know her.

1102
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:37,553
MATT: (muffled yelling)

1103
01:13:37,553 --> 01:13:41,093
LAURA: Right. The ritual that's happening
on top of the tower. How long until that

1104
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:42,252
thing's done?

1105
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,085
MATT: (muffled noises)

1106
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:50,767
LAURA: Blink once for 15 minutes. Blink twice for
an hour or more.

1107
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:54,679
LIAM: Three times for a bunch of days.

1108
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:56,052
SAM: Maybe he doesn't know.

1109
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:59,109
LAURA: Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes,
blink twice for no.

1110
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:01,259
MATT: (muffling noises)

1111
01:14:01,259 --> 01:14:02,921
SAM: 15 minutes! No, that was once for 15
minutes!

1112
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:04,708
LAURA: No, that was an hour, at least!

1113
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:09,506
MARISHA: I thought he blinked before. Are we at an
hour and 15 minutes?

1114
01:14:09,506 --> 01:14:11,680
TALIESIN: I don't think you can call it a blink if
you've got one eye.

1115
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,532
I think it's just a wink.

1116
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,700
MARISHA: A wink? Man, semantics!

1117
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:24,011
MATT: You get the sense that, as you say that, it
does hurt him a little. His demeanor, while

1118
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,255
already pretty shattered, just even further (sad
noise).

1119
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:29,688
TRAVIS: Does he have any pouches on him, or
anything in his hands?

1120
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:34,610
MATT: He had a small sack over his shoulder that
he was leaving with.

1121
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:36,777
He's just adorned in regular--

1122
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:39,248
TRAVIS: Is the sack on the ground now or is it
still over his shoulder?

1123
01:14:39,248 --> 01:14:44,097
MATT: No, it's currently on the ground. He dropped
it as soon as you rushed and pushed him.

1124
01:14:44,097 --> 01:14:46,294
TRAVIS: I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike
and say: look in here.

1125
01:14:46,294 --> 01:14:58,293
MATT: You glance inside. As soon as you grab it,
you hear the clanging of metal. You look inside

1126
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:05,985
and you can see what appear to be a handful of
dark metal shortswords, daggers, simple dried

1127
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:11,089
rations, and, in fact, as you glance inside the
room now, you can see a lot of the supplies here,

1128
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:16,990
aside from construction supplies, you see a
handful of weapons that are well-made,

1129
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,117
recent-made, not seen battle yet.

1130
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:22,468
SAM: They're about to invade.

1131
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:24,809
LAURA: What if we burn the fucking city down?

1132
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:27,557
SAM: I mean, sure! What?

1133
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:32,138
LAURA: I mean, if they're planning on transporting
this whole fucking city, and setting an army loose

1134
01:15:32,138 --> 01:15:38,003
on our world, why don't we just burn the whole
fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy

1135
01:15:38,003 --> 01:15:39,068
their weapons!

1136
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,416
TALIESIN: I am excited by this plan.

1137
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:43,441
SAM: Wait, what? No! That's terrible!

1138
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:45,577
LIAM: Let's burn down Manhattan. How do you do
that?!

1139
01:15:45,577 --> 01:15:51,392
TRAVIS: Shall we ask this gentleman some
questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand.

1140
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:58,096
Obviously, you're like really cool with the
purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken

1141
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:05,844
that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if
you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like

1142
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:09,599
apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head.

1143
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,629
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1144
01:16:11,629 --> 01:16:14,941
LAURA: You did your hand signal for Arnold
Palmer.

1145
01:16:14,941 --> 01:16:16,473
TRAVIS: I did!

1146
01:16:16,473 --> 01:16:18,424
MATT: Universal.

1147
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:20,369
LAURA: Arnold Palmer?

1148
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,862
TRAVIS: 22!

1149
01:16:22,862 --> 01:16:36,216
MATT: 22. He doesn't make a sound, more than the
gentle trickle out of his pant leg does. (laughs)

1150
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,860
TALIESIN: I think that's a yes.

1151
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,011
TRAVIS: Grab the scruff of his collar.

1152
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:48,096
MATT: Okay, as you release, he (gasps). His teeth
are broken and yellow, his one gaping socket is

1153
01:16:48,096 --> 01:16:53,435
twitching a little bit from the recovery of the
sudden, rapid series of events that he was not

1154
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:58,616
expecting today. As he gathers his breath, and
scratches the side of his leg,

1155
01:16:58,616 --> 01:17:04,417
"So. What do you wish to do to me?"

1156
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:08,378
SAM: Nothing! We've got to hurry!

1157
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,825
LAURA: No, really, do you know anything about the
ritual?

1158
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:13,622
MATT: "I mean, not the specifics."

1159
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:16,771
LAURA: Do you know if it's going to be over soon?

1160
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:23,727
MATT: "I know that some of the acolytes were
rushing through, expediting things recently."

1161
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:26,043
MARISHA: Why?

1162
01:17:26,043 --> 01:17:27,711
MATT: "I don't know!"

1163
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:30,005
SAM: Did they tell you to gather weapons?

1164
01:17:30,005 --> 01:17:31,789
MATT: "They just told us to be ready."

1165
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:38,845
LIAM: For what? What's the plan here, man? You're really far
away from anything fucking nice.

1166
01:17:38,845 --> 01:17:43,492
MATT: You watch him close off as you start saying
that. He catches himself saying too much

1167
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,019
information. His demeanor goes cold.

1168
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:48,889
LAURA: Please, we know you're going to transport
to another plane.

1169
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:53,599
MARISHA: You're trying to bail, aren't you? Were
you trying to run?

1170
01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:55,874
SAM: No, he's joining the fight.

1171
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:59,092
LAURA: Oh my god, he was going to leave.

1172
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:05,432
TRAVIS: Well, he's clearly clamming up. I put my
hand back over the front of his face, I take the

1173
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:09,334
other one, put it on the back of his face, and I
start making my fingers touch.

1174
01:18:09,334 --> 01:18:20,213
MATT: (muffled groaning) He reaches up and grabs
the small symbol, familiar loop with the fork

1175
01:18:20,213 --> 01:18:23,635
above it. He clasps it in his hand and doesn't
resist.

1176
01:18:23,635 --> 01:18:30,325
TRAVIS: Do you want it?

1177
01:18:30,325 --> 01:18:37,488
ASHLEY: Yeah! Put him a little lower, Grog. I rip
off the necklace.

1178
01:18:37,488 --> 01:18:40,530
MATT: He's like clasping it in his hand. Make a
strength check.

1179
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,194
TALIESIN: Drop it! Drop it!

1180
01:18:42,194 --> 01:18:44,378
ASHLEY: Oh my god, we're so terrible!

1181
01:18:44,378 --> 01:18:45,737
TRAVIS: Are we?

1182
01:18:45,737 --> 01:18:48,360
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

1183
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:56,138
MATT: He's clasping it, and you can see his one
eye rolls back to hold onto it and he's muttering

1184
01:18:56,138 --> 01:19:01,459
a prayer beneath your fingers and he's (muffled
muttering) and you tear it from his grasp.

1185
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:03,798
(muffled panic)

1186
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:08,920
ASHLEY: We'll give it back! You've got to answer
some questions for us.

1187
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,268
TRAVIS: No, he won't. Look away if you want to
preserve anything, and I just squish his head.

1188
01:19:12,268 --> 01:19:20,946
MATT: As you're saying that, you watch as one eye
opens and his hands go limp and then

1189
01:19:20,946 --> 01:19:23,858
(face exploding) and it just (splattering).

1190
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:25,101
ASHLEY: <i>Grog</i>!

1191
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:27,310
MATT: Spray on Pike.

1192
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:31,446
TRAVIS: I thought you were me giving the signal
like, end it!

1193
01:19:31,446 --> 01:19:36,308
ASHLEY: No! I was going to-- whatever.

1194
01:19:36,308 --> 01:19:38,762
TRAVIS: All right. We'll work on it.

1195
01:19:38,762 --> 01:19:40,416
ASHLEY: We'll find another one. It's okay.

1196
01:19:40,416 --> 01:19:43,509
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry.

1197
01:19:43,509 --> 01:19:45,063
ASHLEY: Brains!

1198
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:46,716
LIAM: Pike got Dragon Aged.

1199
01:19:46,716 --> 01:19:48,635
MATT: Yeah!

1200
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:51,152
MARISHA: Is there a water bucket around?

1201
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:55,153
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1202
01:19:55,153 --> 01:19:59,817
LAURA: So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn
the whole city down?

1203
01:19:59,817 --> 01:20:01,159
SAM: No!

1204
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:02,849
MARISHA: 11.

1205
01:20:02,849 --> 01:20:04,969
TALIESIN: The city is mostly stone; I don't know
if we can burn it down.

1206
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:08,332
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you do find a small
basin that's filled up with water. The people that

1207
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:13,939
live in this city still need to live. It looks
like there are the means of feeding and drinking,

1208
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:19,039
though you get the sense that they may or may
not-- most of the supplies do come from outside

1209
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:20,543
the Shadowfell.

1210
01:20:20,543 --> 01:20:22,608
LAURA: Let's poison the water supply!

1211
01:20:22,608 --> 01:20:28,468
MARISHA: I take a little bit of the water and
control it and let Pike wash off a little bit.

1212
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:29,649
MATT: Okay.

1213
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:33,643
ASHLEY: I think I got a little in my mouth
(gagging).

1214
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:38,038
LIAM: Wait, there's a little bit of skull right
there. All right.

1215
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:41,047
TALIESIN: That's the little chunk where the joint
is. It's just this little bit, it just breaks

1216
01:20:41,047 --> 01:20:43,057
naturally if you put pressure on that side.

1217
01:20:43,057 --> 01:20:49,080
MATT: There's this slumped pile of dark cloth,
thin body, and Riki-Oh mess on the ground.

1218
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,790
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow! Way to bring that back!

1219
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:55,758
MATT: So, what's the plan, guys?

1220
01:20:55,758 --> 01:20:59,342
TALIESIN: We've got a little shadow creature
coming back around in a moment.

1221
01:20:59,342 --> 01:21:02,769
SAM: Want to jump on and do a scouting pass?

1222
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:05,757
LIAM: Yeah.

1223
01:21:05,757 --> 01:21:07,968
TALIESIN: You guys do the scout, we'll heal?

1224
01:21:07,968 --> 01:21:09,856
ASHLEY: You guys, are we not going to do a Heroes'
Feast?

1225
01:21:09,856 --> 01:21:12,723
LAURA: It's an hour. It takes an hour, right?

1226
01:21:12,723 --> 01:21:14,195
SAM: We can't risk it.

1227
01:21:14,195 --> 01:21:18,193
LIAM: What do you think's going to happen in an
hour? Everything's going to kick off in an hour?

1228
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:21,051
SAM: Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes?

1229
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:26,898
LAURA: The pulse has gotten stronger since we've
been here. I don't know if that pulse means it's

1230
01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:29,759
about to go, or if the pulse means that it's five
minutes in.

1231
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,805
SAM: This guy was about to leave his house to go
walk over there for the final part of the ritual.

1232
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:36,093
MARISHA: Or he was trying to bail before the final
part of the ritual.

1233
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:39,140
LIAM: Where's your pet? Let's go find
some shit out.

1234
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,358
MARISHA: He had rations! No one takes rations!

1235
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:45,891
LAURA: He was handing out weapons.

1236
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:48,459
TALIESIN: It was like Carpentry of the Damned sort
of thing.

1237
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:51,937
MARISHA: What if the giant orb has to reach the
crystals?

1238
01:21:51,937 --> 01:21:55,562
TALIESIN: It might, but it might just do the
(buzzing, exploding).

1239
01:21:55,562 --> 01:21:58,329
LAURA: Technical terms.

1240
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:00,567
MARISHA: Yeah, the (buzzing, exploding).

1241
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,100
TALIESIN: It's magic, it's the best I've got.

1242
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,313
TRAVIS: Who's going up?

1243
01:22:03,313 --> 01:22:05,753
SAM: Me and Vax.

1244
01:22:05,753 --> 01:22:08,410
TRAVIS: Just you two, okay.

1245
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,886
ASHLEY: How's everybody doing right now?

1246
01:22:10,962 --> 01:22:13,446
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I'm a little rough.

1247
01:22:13,446 --> 01:22:15,448
TALIESIN: I could use 20 points.

1248
01:22:15,448 --> 01:22:17,196
LAURA: Yeah, I could use 20 points.

1249
01:22:17,196 --> 01:22:20,175
ASHLEY: Let's do a little Mass Cure Wounds
situation.

1250
01:22:20,175 --> 01:22:21,466
MARISHA: Nice.

1251
01:22:21,466 --> 01:22:26,982
TRAVIS: Do it!

1252
01:22:26,982 --> 01:22:31,564
SAM: But do it with a flair!

1253
01:22:31,564 --> 01:22:34,962
(laughter)

1254
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:37,693
ASHLEY: Oh, fudge.

1255
01:22:37,693 --> 01:22:42,722
LAURA: What? Oh that's a one, not seven, isn't
it?

1256
01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:45,012
ASHLEY: 13.

1257
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:47,067
LAURA: That's fine, that's fine!

1258
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:50,392
TALIESIN: We're taking a short rest; I can add
my--

1259
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:52,676
MATT: Are you guys taking a short rest?

1260
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:55,536
LAURA: Well, while they fly up, is it enough time
for the people staying

1261
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:57,080
in the house to heal a bit?

1262
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:02,050
MATT: You guys could take a short rest during that
time, if you want to do a full scoping. By the

1263
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,078
time you come back, that spell's about to fade.

1264
01:23:04,078 --> 01:23:08,048
SAM: I mean, yeah, we're going to go as fast as we
can.

1265
01:23:08,048 --> 01:23:11,035
MATT: So those that are traveling can't take a
short rest.

1266
01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:15,305
TRAVIS: And if that fades, he's fully aware that
he was dominated, right?

1267
01:23:15,305 --> 01:23:20,593
MATT: Well. You don't know.

1268
01:23:20,593 --> 01:23:22,950
TRAVIS: Okay. Especially me.

1269
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,910
MATT: Yeah, you especially don't know.

1270
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,091
LIAM: Time's a-wasting, Scanlan, let's go.

1271
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:29,108
SAM: Let's go. Mr. Mistoffelees!

1272
01:23:29,108 --> 01:23:42,292
MATT: As you open the door, there, just landing
(landing) (gloom stalker croaking). You guys climb

1273
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:43,316
onto its back?

1274
01:23:43,316 --> 01:23:44,317
SAM: Yes, we do!

1275
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:48,291
MATT: You climb onto its back. Touching this
creature is like touching the inside of a freezer.

1276
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:53,914
Even with gauntleted hands, you have to wrap some
of your cloth around to not give yourself

1277
01:23:53,914 --> 01:23:59,700
frostbite over a period of time. Even resting on
it, especially with your leather armors, it chills

1278
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:05,182
you to the bone. As you take up, and even just
ten, 15 minutes into (wings flapping) up into the

1279
01:24:05,182 --> 01:24:09,717
air, gathering as to whether you'll be noticed or
spotted by this, you can feel it beginning to

1280
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:13,794
chill you, your teeth are beginning to chatter
from being in that proximity of the freezing cold

1281
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:21,576
creature. It's strange, as you touch it, it feels
less like fur and flesh and more like you're

1282
01:24:21,576 --> 01:24:29,956
grabbing onto a very, very thick sackcloth. Like,
it tugs and pulls and it feels almost like the

1283
01:24:29,956 --> 01:24:37,696
scruff of a cat or dog's neck, but it has a clothy
texture, and as you grab it, you can feel the cold

1284
01:24:37,696 --> 01:24:43,449
wisps of shadow and darkness obscure your hands.
You feel like you're plunging your arms into it,

1285
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:46,878
but you find purchase within that shadow and hold
on.

1286
01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:50,391
SAM: We'll need to spoon for warmth.

1287
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:53,458
LIAM: I nestle in behind Scanlan.

1288
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,601
SAM: I gladly accept.

1289
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:58,265
LIAM: Let's ride.

1290
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:00,733
TRAVIS: Let's ride?!

1291
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:04,766
(laughing)

1292
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:11,440
MATT: All right, so, as you guys take up into the
sky, and you guys are taking your short rest,

1293
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,167
we're going to take a quick break on our end as
well. Use the restroom, get a snack.

1294
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:16,344
MARISHA: We're taking a break?

1295
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:23,986
MATT: We're taking a break here because it is
8:30. We are going to do another giveaway at the

1296
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:28,804
break here, a Wyrmwood giveaway. A fantastic
flamebox elder hero vault, which is some of the

1297
01:25:28,804 --> 01:25:31,077
prettiest wood that they make.

1298
01:25:31,077 --> 01:25:33,208
LIAM: Maybe the prettiest Wyrmwood box ever.

1299
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,796
LAURA: How come we didn't ever see those before;
is that a new wood?

1300
01:25:35,796 --> 01:25:37,705
MATT: I don't know. But it's cool!

1301
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:40,115
LAURA: I want it!

1302
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:45,200
MATT: Hero vault for whoever the lucky winner is.
To be a part of that drawing, rush over to Twitch

1303
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:53,505
chat. Tonight's password is 'secrets,' plural.
S-E-C-R-E-T-S. So, when you're prompted, enter the

1304
01:25:53,505 --> 01:25:56,883
word 'secrets' in Twitch chat to be part of this
giveaway and we'll come back and announce who it

1305
01:25:56,883 --> 01:26:00,455
is after the break. We'll see you guys here in a
few minutes.

1306
01:26:00,455 --> 01:43:28,012
[break]

1307
01:43:28,012 --> 01:43:31,357
(laughter)

1308
01:43:31,357 --> 01:43:34,272
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role.

1309
01:43:34,272 --> 01:43:35,863
ASHLEY: My timing is bad.

1310
01:43:35,863 --> 01:43:40,824
(laughter)

1311
01:43:40,824 --> 01:43:42,995
MATT: We missed you, too, guys.

1312
01:43:42,995 --> 01:43:45,370
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1313
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:50,920
ASHLEY: I forget, and then I remember to do it,
and then we're already on the air.

1314
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:59,809
MATT: Indeed, we are. Welcome back, everybody.
First off, our winner of the hero case from our

1315
01:43:59,809 --> 01:44:08,425
friends at Wyrmwood is Rory1177. Rory1177, you are
the winner for tonight. Congratulations. Denobo

1316
01:44:08,425 --> 01:44:13,584
will contact you and get your information and have
that shipped off to you asap, so congratulations.

1317
01:44:13,584 --> 01:44:25,990
All right, so as the rest of you are taking a
short rest, the two of you are making your way, as

1318
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:32,523
stealthily as you can, on the back of a gloom
stalker as it encircles the exterior of the Castle

1319
01:44:32,523 --> 01:44:35,774
Entropis. First off, I would like you both to make
a stealth check.

1320
01:44:35,774 --> 01:44:38,266
LIAM: I squeeze the gnome tighter.

1321
01:44:38,266 --> 01:44:43,184
LAURA: Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you
don't get the plus ten anymore.

1322
01:44:43,184 --> 01:44:45,348
LIAM: That's okayish.

1323
01:44:45,348 --> 01:44:47,091
SAM: 21.

1324
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:48,835
TALIESIN: You have advantage, though, on
everything.

1325
01:44:48,835 --> 01:44:50,226
SAM: He's fine.

1326
01:44:50,226 --> 01:44:55,073
LIAM: 34. A low 34.

1327
01:44:55,073 --> 01:45:02,836
MATT: Okay, so you guys begin to circle the
exterior of the tower, making a wide spiral along

1328
01:45:02,836 --> 01:45:12,590
its exterior. You make your way up. It's hard to
gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at

1329
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:22,023
least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I
want you both to make perception checks, please.

1330
01:45:22,023 --> 01:45:25,727
LIAM: Now that we're closer, I'm looking for
windows that she might not have been close enough

1331
01:45:25,727 --> 01:45:27,932
to see. Doors, holes, anything.

1332
01:45:27,932 --> 01:45:29,300
MATT: Perception check.

1333
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:30,683
LIAM: Yes, sir.

1334
01:45:30,683 --> 01:45:34,178
SAM: Natural one! I'm under his body.

1335
01:45:34,178 --> 01:45:37,578
MATT: He's curled up within Vax.

1336
01:45:37,578 --> 01:45:39,383
LIAM: Hey!

1337
01:45:39,383 --> 01:45:43,601
MATT: Not even a top or bottom circumstance.
You're just within.

1338
01:45:43,601 --> 01:45:47,376
LIAM: It really just depends on the day. 26.

1339
01:45:47,376 --> 01:45:56,932
MATT: 26. Okay. No windows. It is a solid tower,
completely around as you cycle around. As you get

1340
01:45:56,932 --> 01:46:04,954
towards the top of it, you notice the three curved
fingerlike spires that curl up at the top and the

1341
01:46:04,954 --> 01:46:11,368
pulsing of the energy. You watch as these very
faint tendrils of magical energy that you've tuned

1342
01:46:11,368 --> 01:46:16,685
in to be able to see better, now that you know what
to look for, are all-- from this height, you can

1343
01:46:16,685 --> 01:46:23,681
see the long strands are undulating and shifting,
almost like the very winds of the land are causing

1344
01:46:23,681 --> 01:46:28,794
them to rotate. You can see the variations in
their form, but they're all still merging and

1345
01:46:28,794 --> 01:46:40,012
entwining at the very top of Entropis. You see
nothing. You can see what appear to be a cluster

1346
01:46:40,012 --> 01:46:52,306
of about 30 or so figures all gathered along the
top of this. You can see what appear to be three

1347
01:46:52,306 --> 01:46:59,501
glowing spheres in a triangular pattern around
this that are accepting the tether of the magical

1348
01:46:59,501 --> 01:47:04,700
energy, and then suffusing what appears to be a
small altar of some kind in the very center of the

1349
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:06,571
top of this tower.

1350
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:09,696
LIAM: Mother bitch.

1351
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:20,238
MATT: You've been circling here for about 15 to 20
minutes or so, and the energy (explosion noise)

1352
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:28,849
untethers and unfurls. There's a shockwave of
warmth that cascades outward from the top of the

1353
01:47:28,849 --> 01:47:32,659
tower. Both of you feel it pass through you, and
that freezing cold that you've been trying

1354
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:38,522
desperately to hold at bay as you're clutching
onto the back of this gloom stalker, this heat

1355
01:47:38,522 --> 01:47:44,779
wave moves past. The gloom stalker (squawks)
instinctually pulls back, and you can see for a

1356
01:47:44,779 --> 01:47:50,014
second it drops, and you feel your stomach bottom
out as it loses about 20 feet of elevation before

1357
01:47:50,014 --> 01:47:53,730
catching itself again. And you watch as any of the
others that are currently cycling around

1358
01:47:53,730 --> 01:48:00,321
the stratosphere over the city of Thar Amphala
also are taken off guard by the sudden burst of

1359
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:08,584
energy. As you glance over, you can see the
tethers that connect have all fallen and faded.

1360
01:48:08,584 --> 01:48:11,222
(music changes)

1361
01:48:11,222 --> 01:48:14,318
SAM: (quietly) How does he do that? How did you do
that?

1362
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:22,131
MATT: You also watch as about 25 or so of these
figures at the top all collapse at once.

1363
01:48:22,131 --> 01:48:24,810
LIAM: But some are left.

1364
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:30,906
MATT: There are some left. You watch and very
faintly, you can see on that altar in the center,

1365
01:48:30,906 --> 01:48:38,413
there is a small bead of pure, vibrant, bright
white light. You watch as a robed figure that

1366
01:48:38,413 --> 01:48:45,787
previously was held in the shadows emerge. You're
too far away to make any more details than that.

1367
01:48:45,787 --> 01:48:52,220
LIAM: A lot of motherfuckers just died on the top
of that tower. You felt that?

1368
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:55,576
SAM: What do we do? Is that the end of the
ritual?

1369
01:48:55,576 --> 01:48:58,815
LIAM: How much time left on that hour, buddy?

1370
01:48:58,815 --> 01:49:02,034
SAM: Enough to get back to our friends, probably.

1371
01:49:02,034 --> 01:49:03,515
LIAM: We've got to go.

1372
01:49:03,515 --> 01:49:07,515
SAM: Should we attack now? Just the two of us?

1373
01:49:07,515 --> 01:49:10,313
LIAM: No, we should not do that.

1374
01:49:10,313 --> 01:49:11,508
SAM: We could.

1375
01:49:11,508 --> 01:49:12,464
LIAM: We could.

1376
01:49:12,464 --> 01:49:15,701
SAM: Between you and me, we're the most powerful
ones in the group.

1377
01:49:15,701 --> 01:49:19,227
LIAM: I just don't feel like freeballing it right
now, and I'd really like the group.

1378
01:49:19,227 --> 01:49:23,258
SAM: I know, but will you at least confirm that
yes, we are the most powerful?

1379
01:49:23,258 --> 01:49:30,024
LIAM: Clearly. We are the most, as the kids say,
OP. Let's get back to the group.

1380
01:49:30,024 --> 01:49:35,468
SAM: All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles,
back down.

1381
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:41,749
MATT: It goes into a rapid dive, making its way
back towards where you left the rest of your

1382
01:49:41,749 --> 01:49:47,513
party. The rest of you, you can go ahead and
regain your short rest. You get your Wild Shape

1383
01:49:47,513 --> 01:49:51,780
back. You can spend any hit dice to heal up if
you'd like. If you haven't already.

1384
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:53,475
LAURA: I already did it.

1385
01:49:53,475 --> 01:49:56,363
MATT: Okay, good. I also need all of you to roll a
wisdom saving throw, please.

1386
01:49:56,363 --> 01:49:58,047
SAM: Everybody?

1387
01:49:58,047 --> 01:50:00,095
MATT: Everybody who was on a short rest.

1388
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:08,821
LAURA: If we had had a Feast, we'd have advantage
on this.

1389
01:50:08,821 --> 01:50:10,718
MARISHA: We would.

1390
01:50:10,718 --> 01:50:13,310
MATT: All right, so.

1391
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:14,940
TALIESIN: 14.

1392
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,443
MARISHA: 30.

1393
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:18,332
LAURA: 24.

1394
01:50:18,332 --> 01:50:22,966
ASHLEY: Just to make sure: I used Gnome Cunning,
because I get advantage on wisdom.

1395
01:50:22,966 --> 01:50:26,304
MATT: It's not a "magical" effect.

1396
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:33,924
ASHLEY: Okay. So then I'll take my first roll,
which was two. And then I will add my wisdom

1397
01:50:33,924 --> 01:50:36,435
saving throw number, which is ten, so I have 12.

1398
01:50:36,435 --> 01:50:38,298
TRAVIS: 19.

1399
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:41,473
SAM: I want you to explain every roll.

1400
01:50:41,473 --> 01:50:47,267
MATT: In the rest you take, the Shadowfell does
not seem to have

1401
01:50:47,267 --> 01:50:49,778
any adverse effect on your presence.

1402
01:50:49,778 --> 01:50:52,610
TALIESIN: However...

1403
01:50:52,610 --> 01:51:00,322
MATT: There's no "however." You complete your rest
fine. You guys all gather your stuff, you take a

1404
01:51:00,322 --> 01:51:05,268
breath and prepare for the next leg of your
venture as the door to your building slams open,

1405
01:51:05,268 --> 01:51:10,646
Scanlan and Vax arriving, just leaping off the
back of the gloom stalker that they had under

1406
01:51:10,646 --> 01:51:13,933
their control. Who is also about to lose its...

1407
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:15,692
TALIESIN: How much longer do they have?

1408
01:51:15,692 --> 01:51:17,152
SAM: Fly away!

1409
01:51:17,152 --> 01:51:19,836
TALIESIN: Attack the tower. Tell it to attack the
tower.

1410
01:51:19,836 --> 01:51:22,281
SAM: Really? It's going to forget halfway there.

1411
01:51:22,281 --> 01:51:24,972
TALIESIN: Maybe we can mess one person up.

1412
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:27,678
SAM: Fly away! Just fly away!

1413
01:51:27,678 --> 01:51:34,203
ASHLEY: On the rest, could I have worked a little
bit more on enchanting the silver bullets?

1414
01:51:34,203 --> 01:51:39,913
MATT: You can spend a little more time on it.
It'll take a few days of getting that to happen.

1415
01:51:39,913 --> 01:51:41,474
ASHLEY: I just keep working on it.

1416
01:51:41,474 --> 01:51:45,516
LAURA: Did we feel that (whoosh) within the
building?

1417
01:51:45,516 --> 01:51:48,777
MATT: You didn't. You may have heard something
strange, but it didn't really catch your

1418
01:51:48,777 --> 01:51:51,647
attention. You guys spent your time resting on the
inside of the building.

1419
01:51:51,647 --> 01:51:53,127
LAURA: What'd you see?

1420
01:51:53,127 --> 01:51:59,292
LIAM: Saw a lot of fucking people just die on the
top of that tower. I can't guarantee it, but I

1421
01:51:59,292 --> 01:52:03,115
think it's a safe bet that your girl Delilah is up
there.

1422
01:52:03,115 --> 01:52:05,416
LAURA: That's where I figured she'd be.

1423
01:52:05,416 --> 01:52:10,645
SAM: It seems they've completed at least some part
of the ritual.

1424
01:52:10,645 --> 01:52:16,209
LIAM: Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse
of energy, 20-something hooded figures just

1425
01:52:16,209 --> 01:52:19,772
dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit
blasted through us.

1426
01:52:19,772 --> 01:52:22,281
LAURA: Can I run out and look at the tower and see
if the orb looks different?

1427
01:52:22,281 --> 01:52:23,884
MARISHA: I join Vex.

1428
01:52:23,884 --> 01:52:27,974
MATT: You guys rush out and peek outside of the
doorway towards the top of Entropis. You see that

1429
01:52:27,974 --> 01:52:34,091
the glowing pulse is gone. The energy tethers from
the siphons are gone.

1430
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:36,272
LAURA: Fuck.

1431
01:52:36,272 --> 01:52:39,597
MARISHA: I look around. Are we still in the
Shadowfell?

1432
01:52:39,597 --> 01:52:44,515
MATT: Perception check.

1433
01:52:44,515 --> 01:52:50,681
MARISHA: That's not great. 18.

1434
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:52,598
MATT: That's enough. Yeah, you're still in the
Shadowfell.

1435
01:52:52,598 --> 01:52:53,967
(sounds of relief)

1436
01:52:53,967 --> 01:52:55,827
TRAVIS: Motherfucking Mercer. That intonation.

1437
01:52:55,827 --> 01:53:01,307
TALIESIN: If you rolled low enough, he'd be like,
"You don't know." Seattle!

1438
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:03,264
You've taken us to Seattle!

1439
01:53:03,264 --> 01:53:08,239
LAURA: Well, we should fucking get up there, then,
huh?

1440
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,975
SAM: Should we go straight up the tower?

1441
01:53:09,975 --> 01:53:11,509
LIAM: What else are we doing here?

1442
01:53:11,509 --> 01:53:12,922
SAM: Yeah, all right.

1443
01:53:12,922 --> 01:53:14,277
TALIESIN: Let's head to the base.

1444
01:53:14,277 --> 01:53:18,778
SAM: But we're going to fight an aerial battle
against super-magical things.

1445
01:53:18,778 --> 01:53:20,344
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1446
01:53:20,344 --> 01:53:23,321
LIAM: We're weighing risk here. What do we think
would happen if

1447
01:53:23,321 --> 01:53:25,815
we spent an hour having that Feast right now?

1448
01:53:25,815 --> 01:53:28,017
TRAVIS: Actually, that's true. Nothing's going to
change at this point.

1449
01:53:28,017 --> 01:53:29,271
SAM: Maybe.

1450
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:35,236
MARISHA: I mean, maybe we should return to
something like sabotaging the machine, or...

1451
01:53:35,236 --> 01:53:40,485
burning the city. Oh god, Vex is rubbing off on
me.

1452
01:53:40,485 --> 01:53:42,482
LAURA: Did you see Delilah up there?

1453
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:45,631
LIAM: No. There was a ringleader, but we were too
far out.

1454
01:53:45,631 --> 01:53:48,288
LAURA: And the ringleader was still standing?

1455
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,415
LIAM: Yeah.

1456
01:53:49,415 --> 01:53:51,228
ASHLEY: How many people were still standing?

1457
01:53:51,228 --> 01:53:53,471
MATT: That would have been three that you
noticed.

1458
01:53:53,471 --> 01:53:54,911
LIAM: Precisely three.

1459
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:56,815
(laughter)

1460
01:53:56,815 --> 01:54:01,470
ASHLEY: Lots of them died in the blast?

1461
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:03,634
SAM: Yeah, so it's not even going to be a tough
fight. We'll just

1462
01:54:03,634 --> 01:54:05,773
take down three people and be done, right?

1463
01:54:05,773 --> 01:54:07,016
LAURA: So easy.

1464
01:54:07,016 --> 01:54:09,863
TALIESIN: The less people we're fighting, the
worse it is.

1465
01:54:09,863 --> 01:54:10,989
MARISHA: Agreed.

1466
01:54:10,989 --> 01:54:12,687
ASHLEY: It won't just be three.

1467
01:54:12,687 --> 01:54:14,541
TALIESIN: It might be four.

1468
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,512
SAM: It'll be... less than three?

1469
01:54:16,512 --> 01:54:22,218
LAURA: Even one with that fucking wall she had
last time, we're fucked.

1470
01:54:22,218 --> 01:54:26,543
MARISHA: How far did the blast go that you saw?

1471
01:54:26,543 --> 01:54:28,586
LIAM: We were 100 yards out or something?

1472
01:54:28,586 --> 01:54:31,869
MATT: Yeah, you were probably about 300 feet out.

1473
01:54:31,869 --> 01:54:38,225
LAURA: We didn't do any research on that wall, did
we? That spell? Did anybody do any research on

1474
01:54:38,225 --> 01:54:41,018
that spell that we saw her do? Down in the
ziggurat?

1475
01:54:41,018 --> 01:54:43,977
TALIESIN: We kind of figured out what it was. It
was a modified version

1476
01:54:43,977 --> 01:54:45,635
of a spell we've seen before.

1477
01:54:45,635 --> 01:54:50,424
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It seemed to be prismatic.
You've seen Prismatic Spray. It's a prismatic

1478
01:54:50,424 --> 01:54:56,614
spell in nature but you didn't really research any
means of defeating it or bypassing it.

1479
01:54:56,614 --> 01:54:59,181
TRAVIS: Do you still have that Earthquake spell?

1480
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:02,065
MARISHA: I believe me and Pike both do, yes.

1481
01:55:02,065 --> 01:55:06,235
TRAVIS: We couldn't, like, earthquake the tower to the
ground. Could we?

1482
01:55:06,286 --> 01:55:10,155
MARISHA: Between me, you, and Pike? We can take
this tower down.

1483
01:55:10,155 --> 01:55:11,471
SAM: Is that true?

1484
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:14,094
TRAVIS: I just don't know about us going to the
top, if we could maybe bring it--

1485
01:55:14,094 --> 01:55:16,138
TALIESIN: Oh, if we could maybe bring the top down
here?

1486
01:55:16,138 --> 01:55:21,154
SAM: That's a good idea, if you can really do it.

1487
01:55:21,154 --> 01:55:22,930
TRAVIS: I just don't know how big around it is. It
might be fucking huge.

1488
01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:24,705
TALIESIN: How big around is the tower?

1489
01:55:24,705 --> 01:55:26,896
MATT: At the very base--

1490
01:55:26,896 --> 01:55:35,344
TALIESIN: He's looking at the tower.

1491
01:55:35,344 --> 01:55:44,545
MATT: -- it's about 170, 180 feet in diameter.

1492
01:55:44,545 --> 01:55:56,093
MARISHA: Hang on, 180 feet in diameter? Hang on.
Pike and I check our spellbooks real quick.

1493
01:55:56,093 --> 01:56:00,653
TALIESIN: Can I do a little engineering? If I were
going to punch at it...

1494
01:56:00,653 --> 01:56:06,893
LIAM: Also, the idea that we're going to sneak
into that tower is farfetched.

1495
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,883
SAM: No, we either have to fly up to the top or
bring it down to us, right?

1496
01:56:09,883 --> 01:56:11,564
LAURA: I like the idea of bringing it down.

1497
01:56:11,564 --> 01:56:15,803
LIAM: Even if it fails, the fight will still come
to-- Either we bring the fight to them, or we rip

1498
01:56:15,803 --> 01:56:17,652
down the tower and bring the fight to us.

1499
01:56:17,652 --> 01:56:21,062
MARISHA: For up to a minute and a hundred foot
radius, centered at a point...

1500
01:56:21,062 --> 01:56:25,696
MATT: It deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any
structure in contact with the ground in the area

1501
01:56:25,696 --> 01:56:29,303
when you cast the spell. If it drops to zero hit
points, it collapses and potentially damages

1502
01:56:29,303 --> 01:56:35,756
nearby creatures. So the question is, do you think
that'll be enough to drop a solid obsidian tower?

1503
01:56:35,756 --> 01:56:39,296
LAURA: It's a tough call. Twice in a row?

1504
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:42,201
MARISHA: But, I mean, two Earthquake spells and
Grog.

1505
01:56:42,201 --> 01:56:44,908
LAURA: I have a siege arrow.

1506
01:56:44,908 --> 01:56:50,263
MARISHA: I will point out this will be burning
mine and Pike's 8th-level spell,

1507
01:56:50,263 --> 01:56:52,714
but it might be worth it.

1508
01:56:52,714 --> 01:57:00,833
SAM: It feels like it's a 3.2 earthquake, we need
a 6.2 earthquake.

1509
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:05,891
TRAVIS: That's true, we do. Let's be honest. We
really do need a massive shake.

1510
01:57:05,891 --> 01:57:09,257
LAURA: What if we weaken the outside and then hit
with the earthquake?

1511
01:57:09,257 --> 01:57:11,395
MARISHA: I can tunnel out underneath it.

1512
01:57:11,395 --> 01:57:18,337
TALIESIN: I think whatever was going on up there is
gone. I think it's happened.

1513
01:57:18,337 --> 01:57:22,365
LAURA: Well, Delilah's still up there, so if she
falls at least she takes some damage.

1514
01:57:22,365 --> 01:57:24,136
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1515
01:57:24,136 --> 01:57:33,727
LIAM: I'm just going to throw my vote in the ring
here, that I think we should take the time for the

1516
01:57:33,727 --> 01:57:41,180
Feast. You know, we're not killing piles of rats
in the sewers, here. This is serious.

1517
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:46,947
SAM: When last time we fought Delilah, were any of
us scared of her?

1518
01:57:46,947 --> 01:57:49,618
TALIESIN: She's not what I'm afraid of.

1519
01:57:49,618 --> 01:57:54,307
LAURA: Wisdom saving throws are major. She could
take control of us.

1520
01:57:54,307 --> 01:58:01,102
TRAVIS: I'm not against that, but I think one
person should stay out of the Feast and keep an

1521
01:58:01,102 --> 01:58:04,496
eye in case they leave in the hour that we're
feasting.

1522
01:58:04,496 --> 01:58:07,918
SAM: Well, if someone's going to stay out of the
Feast, it should be the guy who already has

1523
01:58:07,918 --> 01:58:09,257
advantage on everything.

1524
01:58:09,257 --> 01:58:12,058
TRAVIS: Oh, that too, yeah. I just can't get
afraid, that's all I was going to say.

1525
01:58:12,058 --> 01:58:14,848
LAURA: Yeah, but you can be taken control of with
your brain, Grog.

1526
01:58:14,848 --> 01:58:16,857
TRAVIS: That's assuming a lot.

1527
01:58:16,857 --> 01:58:19,867
TALIESIN: Damn it.

1528
01:58:19,867 --> 01:58:21,538
ASHLEY: Shit.

1529
01:58:21,538 --> 01:58:25,095
TRAVIS: Or we just go get it. We just go after it
and go get it.

1530
01:58:25,095 --> 01:58:28,818
SAM: I'm against the Feast. I think we should just
run in.

1531
01:58:28,818 --> 01:58:31,536
LAURA: I just don't feel like there's time,
honestly.

1532
01:58:31,536 --> 01:58:35,344
SAM: Also, I'm vegan, I don't know if I could eat
everything at the feast.

1533
01:58:35,344 --> 01:58:40,260
LIAM: It is largely GoFiBePo?

1534
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:47,572
SAM: GoFiBePo? Why didn't you just name it a Poobah
Platter?

1535
01:58:47,572 --> 01:58:49,917
LAURA: Oh, that would have been way easier.

1536
01:58:49,917 --> 01:58:53,941
MARISHA: How far are we from the tower in this
little house?

1537
01:58:53,941 --> 01:59:00,854
MATT: In this house, you're a little over a half
mile away from it.

1538
01:59:00,854 --> 01:59:05,081
TALIESIN: It's a ten-minute walk.

1539
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:07,974
MATT: So this house is just outside of the
perimeter wall of the inner cloister.

1540
01:59:07,974 --> 01:59:12,759
MARISHA: You guys could do the Feast and some of
us can help tunnel out

1541
01:59:12,759 --> 01:59:14,866
the ground during that hour.

1542
01:59:14,866 --> 01:59:21,092
TALIESIN: I don't know. I don't think we're going
to bring it down.

1543
01:59:21,092 --> 01:59:23,354
GROG: I don't know if we're going to bring it
down. It was a cool idea, but I don't know if we're

1544
01:59:23,354 --> 01:59:25,718
going to do it. We're no white ancient dragon.

1545
01:59:25,765 --> 01:59:27,330
ASHLEY: What's it made of? Obsidian?

1546
01:59:27,330 --> 01:59:30,503
MATT: You haven't been close enough to really
tell, but it looks to be made of a very thick,

1547
01:59:30,503 --> 01:59:34,051
dark obsidian or onyx-like material.

1548
01:59:34,051 --> 01:59:36,372
LIAM: It's also unsettling as fuck, right?

1549
01:59:36,372 --> 01:59:38,530
LAURA: Oh, it's probably magically protected.

1550
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:40,085
LIAM: Probably.

1551
01:59:40,085 --> 01:59:42,372
TALIESIN: It may just hover there if we knock
this.

1552
01:59:42,372 --> 01:59:44,271
LAURA: That is very true.

1553
01:59:44,271 --> 01:59:47,773
TALIESIN: It may be keeping the ground up as
opposed to being sitting

1554
01:59:47,773 --> 01:59:49,431
on the ground at that point.

1555
01:59:49,431 --> 01:59:51,129
MARISHA: So we're going to try to fly up?

1556
01:59:51,129 --> 01:59:52,373
TALIESIN: Or walk up through the inside.

1557
01:59:52,373 --> 01:59:54,847
GROG: Raise your hand if you want a Heroes'
Feast.

1558
01:59:54,847 --> 01:59:56,834
LIAM: For you all, yes.

1559
01:59:56,834 --> 01:59:58,737
TRAVIS: Four?

1560
01:59:58,737 --> 02:00:00,266
SAM: Is that a raise or not?

1561
02:00:00,266 --> 02:00:01,677
TRAVIS: Are you scratching your ear or are you
raising your hand?

1562
02:00:01,677 --> 02:00:03,937
TALIESIN: Yes, damn it.

1563
02:00:03,937 --> 02:00:05,976
SAM: Wait, so, are we four?

1564
02:00:05,976 --> 02:00:09,901
ASHLEY: I'm just nervous. I know we don't have
time, but what if this is one of those decisions

1565
02:00:09,901 --> 02:00:12,270
where later we're like "We should have fucking
done a Heroes' Feast"?

1566
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:13,521
TRAVIS: Well, let's do it.

1567
02:00:13,521 --> 02:00:17,018
ASHLEY: I don't know, though, I don't know if we
have the time. This is hard.

1568
02:00:17,018 --> 02:00:20,379
TRAVIS: Well, the transaction upstairs has already
happened, whether they get away or not.

1569
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:22,969
MARISHA: I have a feeling we're going to be down
here a while.

1570
02:00:22,969 --> 02:00:29,941
LAURA: Maybe we can prepare the Feast, keep an eye
out. If we have to ditch out on the Feast early,

1571
02:00:29,941 --> 02:00:31,097
then we do.

1572
02:00:31,097 --> 02:00:35,128
MARISHA: Keyleth looks out the window again. Are
people panicked, are people running around? Is

1573
02:00:35,128 --> 02:00:36,745
there a rabble in the street?

1574
02:00:36,745 --> 02:00:40,513
MATT: There's no technical window in this
building. There's the door.

1575
02:00:40,513 --> 02:00:42,215
TRAVIS: She just pushes her head against the
wall.

1576
02:00:42,215 --> 02:00:52,217
MATT: So you look out the door and glance through.
You do notice, there's no panic, but you do see a

1577
02:00:52,217 --> 02:00:57,508
number of-- and this is interesting-- you glance
out, and you don't see any undead wandering the

1578
02:00:57,508 --> 02:01:03,551
streets of the inner cloister. At least, not like
the outer area was. You do see-- make a perception

1579
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:07,062
check, actually.

1580
02:01:07,062 --> 02:01:10,489
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! 30!

1581
02:01:10,489 --> 02:01:15,206
MATT: You see, throughout the street, which, the
street from here gets about halfway to the tower

1582
02:01:15,206 --> 02:01:23,870
before it hits a building and curves around. You
see maybe 35 or 40 total people in matching or

1583
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:28,381
close cultist robes or similar colors, all making
their way towards the tower.

1584
02:01:28,381 --> 02:01:32,221
TALIESIN: They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck
it. Just go.

1585
02:01:32,221 --> 02:01:35,963
LAURA: We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill
'em all on the way up.

1586
02:01:35,963 --> 02:01:41,068
MARISHA: Man, you're frosty today. You're just--

1587
02:01:41,068 --> 02:01:44,486
LAURA: They're trying to come over into our
territory. I don't like it. They're all assholes.

1588
02:01:44,486 --> 02:01:46,037
TRAVIS: Shall we go in?

1589
02:01:46,037 --> 02:01:48,623
MARISHA: Well, how are we going to go in, though?
Just flying up?

1590
02:01:48,623 --> 02:01:51,894
TALIESIN: We have one broom, we don't have two
brooms anymore.

1591
02:01:51,894 --> 02:01:54,896
We got a carpet, and we got wings.

1592
02:01:54,896 --> 02:02:00,869
LAURA: And a couple people with wings. Oh god,
the creepy music is starting.

1593
02:02:00,869 --> 02:02:03,603
We gotta go, y'all.

1594
02:02:03,603 --> 02:02:04,865
LIAM: Beeline to the tower.

1595
02:02:04,865 --> 02:02:08,061
MARISHA: And then what? And then what, though?
Once we get there? Play it by ear?

1596
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:13,769
TALIESIN: Throw everything off the top. Break
everything. Smash everything.

1597
02:02:13,769 --> 02:02:18,541
LAURA: It's Delilah. She's going to destroy us. Do
we have any way to neutralize her magic?

1598
02:02:18,541 --> 02:02:24,184
TRAVIS: Well, you could turn into a... no.

1599
02:02:24,184 --> 02:02:31,238
MARISHA: I can't. I gave Vax Foresight. I cannot
turn into a beholder today.

1600
02:02:31,238 --> 02:02:32,605
SAM: I can.

1601
02:02:32,605 --> 02:02:34,092
TALIESIN: You can?

1602
02:02:34,092 --> 02:02:35,436
SAM: Yes.

1603
02:02:35,436 --> 02:02:37,613
MARISHA: Do you have Shapechange?

1604
02:02:37,613 --> 02:02:39,407
SAM: Something like it.

1605
02:02:39,407 --> 02:02:41,438
(gasping)

1606
02:02:41,438 --> 02:02:44,300
TALIESIN: All right, this is almost a plan. Let's
do this.

1607
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,658
TRAVIS: It's more than we normally have.

1608
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:47,186
TALIESIN: It's far more.

1609
02:02:47,186 --> 02:02:49,760
LAURA: Are there a lot of gloom stalkers around?

1610
02:02:49,760 --> 02:03:00,843
MATT: You can tell with the loss of magical energy
that they've been tossed askew a bit. Their

1611
02:03:00,843 --> 02:03:05,630
patterns of circling and being intent, they're a
little more scattered a bit, but there are still

1612
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:11,057
maybe a few dozen that look over the inner
cloister.

1613
02:03:11,057 --> 02:03:15,038
TALIESIN: Let's make our way to the tower and
maybe head up through the tower. We don't have to

1614
02:03:15,038 --> 02:03:17,098
necessarily fly up to the top.

1615
02:03:17,098 --> 02:03:25,862
LAURA: Wait a minute. Did the orb at the top turn
the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn?

1616
02:03:25,862 --> 02:03:34,486
MATT: There were faint orbs that were taking the
energy and focusing it towards that center altar,

1617
02:03:34,486 --> 02:03:40,808
and when everything faded after the shock wave,
what you saw looked like the tiniest star. It was

1618
02:03:40,808 --> 02:03:46,619
just a speck of extremely bright light that to
look directly at it hurt.

1619
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:51,496
TRAVIS: I don't know! I don't! Just go get it.

1620
02:03:51,496 --> 02:03:56,340
MARISHA: I'm honestly still kind of into the
earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not

1621
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:57,355
going to lie.

1622
02:03:57,355 --> 02:03:58,491
SAM: That's not going to work!

1623
02:03:58,491 --> 02:03:59,546
MARISHA: How do you know?

1624
02:03:59,546 --> 02:04:01,228
SAM: You said 50 points of damage?

1625
02:04:01,228 --> 02:04:05,845
TALIESIN: I can take 50 points of damage. I can
take two earthquakes, personally.

1626
02:04:05,845 --> 02:04:09,499
SAM: I mean, just from a metagaming scenario,
that's not even-- that can't even hurt--

1627
02:04:09,499 --> 02:04:13,404
MARISHA: No, no, no. The tremor deals 50
bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact

1628
02:04:13,404 --> 02:04:17,704
with the ground in your area when you cast the
spell, and at the start of each of your turns

1629
02:04:17,704 --> 02:04:20,745
until the spell ends, and the spell lasts a
minute.

1630
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:23,050
SAM: So you get ten 50s.

1631
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:24,813
MARISHA: Ten of those. Ten 50s.

1632
02:04:24,813 --> 02:04:26,236
LAURA: Oh, and then times two.

1633
02:04:26,236 --> 02:04:27,793
MARISHA: With Pike and I.

1634
02:04:27,793 --> 02:04:32,850
SAM: So that's 1000 points. Over a minute. That's
better than I thought.

1635
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:34,455
LIAM: Is it concentration?

1636
02:04:34,455 --> 02:04:40,150
MARISHA: It's concentration for up to a minute,
and it has a 500-foot range, and a 100-foot

1637
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:45,062
radius. So Pike and I could split, half and half
of the tower.

1638
02:04:45,062 --> 02:04:47,965
TRAVIS: It's pretty fucking Hollywood. I kind of
like it.

1639
02:04:47,965 --> 02:04:49,960
TALIESIN: All right! All right, let's do it.

1640
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,162
MARISHA: I feel like if we go right up to the top
of the tower, it's like walking into the danger.

1641
02:04:54,162 --> 02:04:57,498
TALIESIN: Let's bring the tower down to us.

1642
02:04:57,498 --> 02:05:00,751
MARISHA: This is insane!

1643
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:04,379
LIAM: And you can still fuck shit up while you got
that earthquake going, right?

1644
02:05:04,379 --> 02:05:06,865
MARISHA: Well, how do you mean?

1645
02:05:06,865 --> 02:05:11,249
LAURA: Oh, yeah, if you have that spell going, you
can do other things in case things attack us?

1646
02:05:11,249 --> 02:05:13,964
LIAM: Are you just doing Earthquake the whole
time, or are you just standing there staring at

1647
02:05:13,964 --> 02:05:15,203
the ground?

1648
02:05:15,203 --> 02:05:19,656
MARISHA: It's my concentration, so I can keep it
going and do an instant reaction spell.

1649
02:05:19,656 --> 02:05:22,302
MATT: Do other things, you can't do another
concentration spell.

1650
02:05:22,302 --> 02:05:24,735
LIAM: But you're not lightning anybody's ass, not
doing anything like that.

1651
02:05:24,735 --> 02:05:26,032
You're focusing on the tower.

1652
02:05:26,032 --> 02:05:28,800
MARISHA: I mean, I can throw a Fireball and keep
it going, yeah.

1653
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,458
LIAM: That's really big. All right.

1654
02:05:31,458 --> 02:05:35,449
TALIESIN: I say the movers and shakers get the
cloaks. Let's head out.

1655
02:05:35,449 --> 02:05:40,400
LAURA: Get up as close as we can to support Pike
and Keyleth.

1656
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:43,607
TALIESIN: And we keep them safe. We are playing
defense.

1657
02:05:43,607 --> 02:05:44,627
LAURA: Yes.

1658
02:05:44,627 --> 02:05:45,908
MARISHA: God, I hope this works.

1659
02:05:45,908 --> 02:05:47,031
TALIESIN: God, I hope this works, too.

1660
02:05:47,031 --> 02:05:48,409
MARISHA: I don't know if this is going to work!

1661
02:05:48,409 --> 02:05:49,853
LAURA: This is stupid as fuck!

1662
02:05:49,853 --> 02:05:54,118
TALIESIN: We're distance. Anybody gets near them,
we take them out.

1663
02:05:54,118 --> 02:05:58,594
MARISHA: Grog, can you at the right moment just do
a big-- see if you can topple it over?

1664
02:05:58,594 --> 02:06:01,401
TRAVIS: I can try and do whatever you want. I can
run around and punch

1665
02:06:01,401 --> 02:06:03,044
a bunch of holes in it, whatever.

1666
02:06:03,044 --> 02:06:08,508
TALIESIN: We're going to focus everything on one
side of the tower, we're going to try and bring it

1667
02:06:08,508 --> 02:06:11,253
down in a direction. Here we go.

1668
02:06:11,253 --> 02:06:15,227
LAURA: Yes, focus it on one side of the tower.
Both on the same side.

1669
02:06:15,227 --> 02:06:23,749
TALIESIN: Like a tree. Let's do this. This is a
terrible plan. All right.

1670
02:06:23,749 --> 02:06:25,499
LAURA Just trying to gauge Matt.

1671
02:06:25,499 --> 02:06:27,413
MARISHA: I know! Matt's stone cold!

1672
02:06:27,413 --> 02:06:30,049
TALIESIN: Matt's thinking about all the other
people he could be playing D&D with right now.

1673
02:06:30,049 --> 02:06:33,817
(laughing)

1674
02:06:33,817 --> 02:06:36,101
TALIESIN: He's imagining a whole other set of
faces here.

1675
02:06:36,101 --> 02:06:39,575
LIAM: All right, let's teleport inside that
dragon. Come on.

1676
02:06:39,575 --> 02:06:41,154
MATT: Yeah, what's the plan, guys?

1677
02:06:41,154 --> 02:06:42,246
LIAM: That's the plan.

1678
02:06:42,246 --> 02:06:46,820
LAURA: We're going to get close enough so that
they can do their 500 feet distance. But keep a

1679
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,061
distance to the tower.

1680
02:06:48,061 --> 02:06:52,638
MARISHA: And if we can be hidden while we're doing
this, instead of being open. We have a 500-foot

1681
02:06:52,638 --> 02:06:55,568
range here. We've got a dope-ass range.

1682
02:06:55,568 --> 02:06:57,101
TALIESIN: Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a
cloak.

1683
02:06:57,101 --> 02:06:59,503
TRAVIS: I'm huge.

1684
02:06:59,503 --> 02:07:00,664
TALIESIN: He's huge.

1685
02:07:00,664 --> 02:07:04,070
LAURA: We're going to try to get in a building
that's closer to the tower.

1686
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:08,678
MATT: Okay. Seeming lasts for eight hours, so
you're still under the guise of that illusion.

1687
02:07:08,678 --> 02:07:11,199
SAM: Although we don't--

1688
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:12,613
LAURA: -- need that anymore.

1689
02:07:12,613 --> 02:07:13,953
TALIESIN: Well, we can look like cultists.

1690
02:07:13,953 --> 02:07:20,358
SAM: Keyleth, you said that there's no other
undead around here, right? Maybe we shouldn't look

1691
02:07:20,358 --> 02:07:21,703
like undead, then.

1692
02:07:21,703 --> 02:07:23,862
TALIESIN: Can you shift what we look like without
changing it?

1693
02:07:23,862 --> 02:07:29,331
SAM: I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't.
That's a one-time thing.

1694
02:07:29,331 --> 02:07:32,570
LAURA: Maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists.

1695
02:07:32,570 --> 02:07:34,312
MARISHA: How many robes did we swipe?

1696
02:07:34,312 --> 02:07:37,490
SAM: We've got the one from the guy whose head we
just crushed.

1697
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:41,519
MATT: You would have four cloaks, because there's
two you got from the outside at the ritual, and

1698
02:07:41,519 --> 02:07:47,257
there's the one from the guy you killed when you
got here. Well, technically, there was the two

1699
02:07:47,257 --> 02:07:51,273
that you killed when you got there, but you didn't
say you grabbed those. Oh, you did, you grabbed

1700
02:07:51,273 --> 02:07:55,195
them off. So that's two, five, six. You have six
cloaks.

1701
02:07:55,195 --> 02:07:57,360
LAURA: Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we
just killed in front of the --

1702
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,388
MATT: That was included.

1703
02:07:58,388 --> 02:08:00,597
SAM: Me and Pike, she could be on my shoulders and
we could share one cloak.

1704
02:08:00,597 --> 02:08:02,154
LAURA: Yeah! That's good!

1705
02:08:02,154 --> 02:08:04,362
TRAVIS: I have that Cloak of Smashing that Percy
gave me.

1706
02:08:04,362 --> 02:08:07,058
MARISHA: Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love
it!

1707
02:08:07,058 --> 02:08:08,659
LAURA: Yeah, we'll just robe it up.

1708
02:08:08,659 --> 02:08:11,811
MATT: You guys all throw on the--

1709
02:08:11,811 --> 02:08:13,609
ASHLEY: I almost feel like it should be the other
way around.

1710
02:08:13,609 --> 02:08:15,057
SAM: Oh, it absolutely should.

1711
02:08:15,057 --> 02:08:18,569
(laughter)

1712
02:08:18,569 --> 02:08:32,459
MATT: Six cloaks, seven players. You guys are
straight-up doing-- I am so proud of everything

1713
02:08:32,459 --> 02:08:34,623
that has just happened.

1714
02:08:34,623 --> 02:08:39,776
(laughter)

1715
02:08:39,776 --> 02:08:43,568
SAM: To make it look like our arms can reach the
ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks?

1716
02:08:43,568 --> 02:08:44,672
MATT: Yes, they are.

1717
02:08:44,672 --> 02:08:46,500
SAM: I'm going to hold a flute and my sword.

1718
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,929
(laughing)

1719
02:08:48,929 --> 02:08:51,574
LIAM: Mythcarver! You used Mythcarver to pull a
Little Rascals!

1720
02:08:51,574 --> 02:08:55,359
MATT: "There will be no survivors!"

1721
02:08:55,359 --> 02:08:59,857
TALIESIN: "The dread Pirate Roberts is here for
your souls!"

1722
02:08:59,857 --> 02:09:01,860
LIAM: Hey guys, it's the third time Scanlan has
used Mythcarver!

1723
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,343
(laughter)

1724
02:09:04,343 --> 02:09:06,255
MARISHA: That's a vestige right there!

1725
02:09:06,255 --> 02:09:11,363
TALIESIN: It's gone from exalted to shamed.

1726
02:09:11,363 --> 02:09:14,563
MATT: It retracts into a dagger now.

1727
02:09:14,563 --> 02:09:17,943
TALIESIN: Never happens. This never happens.

1728
02:09:17,943 --> 02:09:26,614
MATT: All right. In a hip montage, you pull out
the various cloaks, assemble your materials,

1729
02:09:26,614 --> 02:09:28,205
getting ready.

1730
02:09:28,205 --> 02:09:30,220
TALIESIN: We are a bunch of assholes.

1731
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:34,951
MATT: Scanlan hops on top of Pike, the cloak is
placed over you. You get your sleeves ready, and

1732
02:09:34,951 --> 02:09:42,442
you all walk out into the cold air of the
Shadowfell, making your way

1733
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:44,956
towards the center of the city.

1734
02:09:44,956 --> 02:09:48,400
MARISHA: Be cool. Be cool.

1735
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:52,367
LIAM: I'm also going to say, some time in the last
several hours, I don't remember what the armor is

1736
02:09:52,367 --> 02:09:54,241
set to, to necrotic.

1737
02:09:54,241 --> 02:09:57,134
MATT: I think you may have said that before you
went in, just in case.

1738
02:09:57,134 --> 02:09:58,566
I assumed that was the case.

1739
02:09:58,566 --> 02:09:59,921
LAURA: I think that was already there, yeah.

1740
02:09:59,921 --> 02:10:03,568
TALIESIN: And remember, if anyone looks at you,
close one eye. Just be winking.

1741
02:10:03,568 --> 02:10:08,301
Always be winking. Left eye.

1742
02:10:08,301 --> 02:10:12,501
LAURA: Does everybody have their arms, that we've
run into so far? Or are they missing an arm, too?

1743
02:10:12,501 --> 02:10:14,036
An eye and an arm or just an eye?

1744
02:10:14,036 --> 02:10:18,246
MATT: It varies. Not everyone seems to be missing
a hand, but most of them are missing an eye.

1745
02:10:18,246 --> 02:10:19,487
LAURA: Okay.

1746
02:10:19,487 --> 02:10:21,912
LIAM: You all look like my sister.

1747
02:10:21,912 --> 02:10:28,466
MARISHA: You need to get your eyes checked, then.
Your depth perception may be off.

1748
02:10:28,466 --> 02:10:31,969
SAM: All right, we go!

1749
02:10:31,969 --> 02:10:41,920
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up the
street, following behind the few stragglers that

1750
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:47,051
you see trying to catch up with the rest of the
groups of people that have filtered out of the

1751
02:10:47,051 --> 02:10:51,009
buildings and made their way towards the center.
You make your way through some of the side roads,

1752
02:10:51,009 --> 02:10:55,052
following around, and you can see now that the
closer you get to the city, the more the

1753
02:10:55,052 --> 02:11:01,367
structures, the buildings here, are built in a
spiral. The roads don't intersect at spokes, they

1754
02:11:01,367 --> 02:11:05,729
all gradually curve in to the tower. If you're
looking at it overhead, it looks like this large

1755
02:11:05,729 --> 02:11:13,455
spiral into the tower, like a pinwheel. You follow
the curvature of the road, which prevents you from

1756
02:11:13,455 --> 02:11:17,969
seeing the end point, and as you begin to get
close to some of the clusters of people that are

1757
02:11:17,969 --> 02:11:23,496
walking with a brisk walk, but still walking
towards the tower, you fall back a little bit to

1758
02:11:23,496 --> 02:11:29,369
not draw any attention. As you're making your way
there, you watch as two individuals hurry up that

1759
02:11:29,369 --> 02:11:34,947
were a little bit behind you, and rush up to the
side and are walking in pace. They glance over.

1760
02:11:34,947 --> 02:11:42,662
MARISHA: Hoods forward.

1761
02:11:42,662 --> 02:11:50,515
MATT: One of them, who appears to be a younger
man, probably 18, 19 or so, who's got this little

1762
02:11:50,515 --> 02:11:59,853
patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a
little malnourished. He still has both eyes. He

1763
02:11:59,853 --> 02:12:04,047
rushes up real fast, his hood pulling back a
little bit, and he's looking around, excited but

1764
02:12:04,047 --> 02:12:10,952
also with trepidation. "So it's happening, huh?
It's really happening!"

1765
02:12:10,952 --> 02:12:12,392
LAURA: I guess so.

1766
02:12:12,392 --> 02:12:14,323
LIAM: It's fucking wild.

1767
02:12:14,323 --> 02:12:15,995
LAURA: So exciting.

1768
02:12:15,995 --> 02:12:18,541
SAM: I'm so excited to be here!

1769
02:12:18,541 --> 02:12:19,721
LAURA: Oh, don't.

1770
02:12:19,721 --> 02:12:21,844
MATT: Make a deception check.

1771
02:12:21,844 --> 02:12:25,049
TRAVIS: Keep your mouth shut! Just keep your mouth
shut!

1772
02:12:25,049 --> 02:12:27,550
MARISHA: Just nod and smile.

1773
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:29,894
SAM: 24.

1774
02:12:29,894 --> 02:12:43,409
MATT: He looks at you and goes, "Oh! I didn't know
the Whispered One takes the special ones, too!"

1775
02:12:43,409 --> 02:12:45,450
TRAVIS: Yep! Sure does!

1776
02:12:45,450 --> 02:12:49,014
TALIESIN: What are you going to do after?

1777
02:12:49,014 --> 02:12:50,827
MATT: "I don't know."

1778
02:12:50,827 --> 02:12:53,452
TALIESIN: Surely you've thought.

1779
02:12:53,452 --> 02:13:01,307
MATT: "I'm pretty low on the totem pole here. I'm
just excited to be on the right side of history."

1780
02:13:01,307 --> 02:13:05,095
LAURA: Ditto.

1781
02:13:05,095 --> 02:13:08,294
LIAM: Fuck the normies.

1782
02:13:08,294 --> 02:13:12,858
MATT: "All right." And he rushes up past you guys
to try and catch up.

1783
02:13:12,858 --> 02:13:14,306
SAM: So awkward.

1784
02:13:14,306 --> 02:13:18,320
LAURA: I think he bought it. I think we played it
really cool there, guys.

1785
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,577
MARISHA: I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for
this long.

1786
02:13:21,577 --> 02:13:25,861
TALIESIN: So are we close enough now that we can
start this?

1787
02:13:25,861 --> 02:13:29,689
MATT: Not yet. You're about maybe 1,000 feet or so
away.

1788
02:13:29,689 --> 02:13:32,162
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if there's any
structures that are within distance so that once

1789
02:13:32,162 --> 02:13:35,168
they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we
can perch.

1790
02:13:35,168 --> 02:13:37,474
MARISHA: We only need to be so far out.

1791
02:13:37,474 --> 02:13:40,126
TALIESIN: We can cover you from a roof.

1792
02:13:40,126 --> 02:13:41,815
MATT: Perception check, Percival.

1793
02:13:41,815 --> 02:13:44,634
LIAM: Also wondering how we're doing in the gloom
stalker department?

1794
02:13:44,634 --> 02:13:51,103
MATT: No one's seen you, currently. It seems that
whatever piercing vision they have, it does not

1795
02:13:51,103 --> 02:13:52,422
seem to pierce robes.

1796
02:13:52,422 --> 02:13:54,579
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out for buildings,
too.

1797
02:13:54,579 --> 02:13:56,072
TALIESIN: 15.

1798
02:13:56,072 --> 02:13:58,270
MATT: Okay. Then you as well make a perception
check.

1799
02:13:58,270 --> 02:13:59,916
TALIESIN: Please.

1800
02:13:59,916 --> 02:14:04,769
LAURA: 23.

1801
02:14:04,769 --> 02:14:11,117
MATT: 23. Okay. You glance about, and there are a
lot of buildings here with vantage points. They're

1802
02:14:11,117 --> 02:14:17,176
all similar heights. There are a few that are
outliers, but most of them are one and a half to

1803
02:14:17,176 --> 02:14:23,406
two stories, like a one story with an attic or an
attic space, like a half-story. Or two stories.

1804
02:14:23,406 --> 02:14:29,412
You do check a few that are third-story, and a lot
of them are almost in steeple-like spires at the

1805
02:14:29,412 --> 02:14:34,967
top. You start to notice there is a theme. A lot
of the buildings closer to the tower are built in

1806
02:14:34,967 --> 02:14:40,418
a similar theme as the tower itself. You begin to
see the edges of the roofs curve up into their own

1807
02:14:40,418 --> 02:14:48,980
spikes, and the further in you go, the more
dangerous and unwelcoming the deeper inner

1808
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:56,562
cloister of Thar Amphala is to witness. You can
see now certain people are climbing onto the

1809
02:14:56,562 --> 02:15:02,432
roofs. They're getting up there, almost like
they're preparing for some sort of a festival or a

1810
02:15:02,432 --> 02:15:03,692
fireworks show.

1811
02:15:03,692 --> 02:15:05,023
MARISHA: Like the Fourth of fucking July.

1812
02:15:05,023 --> 02:15:06,756
LAURA: The aliens are coming and we're welcoming
them.

1813
02:15:06,756 --> 02:15:08,521
TRAVIS: Well, they're not wrong.

1814
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:20,241
MATT: You notice, Vex... There's been no change in
daylight or nightlight here. It's been this

1815
02:15:20,241 --> 02:15:28,035
constant deep, dark gray gloom that hangs over the
Shadowfell, unchanging, unshifting. There's a

1816
02:15:28,035 --> 02:15:31,899
creeping brightness on the horizon that you feel
rising.

1817
02:15:31,899 --> 02:15:34,512
LAURA: We're getting ready to teleport.

1818
02:15:34,512 --> 02:15:43,223
MATT: And you watch as that creeping brightness
forms a dome over your space, and then comes to a

1819
02:15:43,223 --> 02:15:48,643
close over the top of the tower, and where once
there was this gloomy skyscape, you now see what

1820
02:15:48,643 --> 02:15:55,037
appears to be a brighter, clouded sky. The
temperature grows a little colder, and you begin

1821
02:15:55,037 --> 02:16:04,143
to see snowfall. Gentle snow begins to fall, and
you watch as some of the cultists surrounding

1822
02:16:04,143 --> 02:16:06,383
start reaching up and catching it in their hands.

1823
02:16:06,383 --> 02:16:07,750
TALIESIN: Now, now!

1824
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:09,680
SAM: We've still got to attack.

1825
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:13,024
MARISHA: It's totally taken us to Whitestone.

1826
02:16:13,024 --> 02:16:15,427
SAM: It's okay, we can still kill everybody.

1827
02:16:15,427 --> 02:16:16,922
MATT: Make a nature check.

1828
02:16:16,922 --> 02:16:21,785
LAURA: We're in the north. There's a lot of places
that snow. It could be Draconia. There's a lot of

1829
02:16:21,785 --> 02:16:22,892
places that snow.

1830
02:16:22,892 --> 02:16:25,025
LIAM: But it's Delilah Briarwood.

1831
02:16:25,025 --> 02:16:27,584
MARISHA: 19.

1832
02:16:27,584 --> 02:16:35,848
MATT: You have no direct idea of where you are,
but based on the weather that you left Whitestone

1833
02:16:35,848 --> 02:16:43,994
in not too long ago, this isn't Whitestone or near
Whitestone. The weather patterns are a little more

1834
02:16:43,994 --> 02:16:47,340
classic snow.

1835
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:50,886
LAURA: Is it winter in Wildemount right now?

1836
02:16:50,886 --> 02:16:57,038
MATT: It's the tail end of winter in a few
places.

1837
02:16:57,038 --> 02:17:00,810
LIAM: Tower still needs to come down.

1838
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:06,311
SAM: Let's go. Let's move. Let's attack. Are we
within 500 feet?

1839
02:17:06,311 --> 02:17:12,542
MATT: You guys are about now within 500 feet.

1840
02:17:12,542 --> 02:17:16,146
LAURA: Fucking get into the building that we can,
and then start it.

1841
02:17:16,146 --> 02:17:20,732
MARISHA: Pike and I huddle together and try and
join forces.

1842
02:17:20,732 --> 02:17:23,454
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

1843
02:17:23,454 --> 02:17:24,637
MARISHA: Let's do it.

1844
02:17:24,637 --> 02:17:36,178
MATT: As you guys are holding hands, a voice
begins to ring out. Omnipresent. Directionless,

1845
02:17:36,178 --> 02:17:45,220
like it's being positioned directly into the minds
of each of you from wherever it stands. It's an

1846
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:54,836
unfamiliar voice. The words creep and curl in,
like they've always been resting, and now is the

1847
02:17:54,836 --> 02:18:00,725
moment is for them to reveal themselves.

1848
02:18:00,725 --> 02:18:09,632
"I would ask you to 
listen before you make a fool of

1849
02:18:09,632 --> 02:18:29,055
"yourselves. I've watched you since you stepped
into my domain, and I'm not going to lie, it's

1850
02:18:29,055 --> 02:18:44,174
"been entertaining. I admire your gumption. It
reminds me of others who have tried what you are

1851
02:18:44,174 --> 02:19:06,398
"trying. But they're dead now, so I leave the
choice to you. You can either walk away, or you

1852
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:18,358
"can join me, or you will die, and join me
anyway."

1853
02:19:18,358 --> 02:19:26,752
LAURA: Eff that shit. Just do it.

1854
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:30,186
LIAM: No one walks away.

1855
02:19:30,186 --> 02:19:36,287
MARISHA: People don't tell us to stop if they're
not afraid of what we're doing.

1856
02:19:36,287 --> 02:19:37,738
TALIESIN: To the end.

1857
02:19:37,738 --> 02:19:39,295
LAURA: To the end.

1858
02:19:39,295 --> 02:19:42,836
SAM: To the end.

1859
02:19:42,836 --> 02:19:45,970
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just pretend that's not
really happening.

1860
02:19:45,970 --> 02:19:48,129
LAURA: Do it.

1861
02:19:48,129 --> 02:19:55,922
MARISHA: I love you all. We do it, above the
screaming, howling Horror Nights sound effects.

1862
02:19:55,922 --> 02:19:57,474
TALIESIN: I pull Silence.

1863
02:19:57,474 --> 02:20:03,793
MATT: All right. As you guys clasp hands, and
begin the intricate incantation for the Earthquake

1864
02:20:03,793 --> 02:20:09,731
spell, you can hear the cheers of people on the
rooftops. They're standing up now, and they're all

1865
02:20:09,731 --> 02:20:16,540
shouting, "Yes! Yes, I hear you!" You get the
sense that perhaps you weren't the only ones that

1866
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:24,851
have been spoken to, although the conversations
may differ from individual to individual. As you

1867
02:20:24,851 --> 02:20:34,860
guys complete your incantation, you watch as the
dust begins to rise around the base. You see

1868
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:46,009
Entropis begin to quiver back and forth, and you
watch as everyone begins to rush to the edge of

1869
02:20:46,009 --> 02:20:50,266
the rooftops, then rush into the streets to look
up, their hands raised to the sky, not sure what

1870
02:20:50,266 --> 02:21:03,399
this means, but basking in whatever glory this
next sign or omen is to be. You watch as a loud,

1871
02:21:03,399 --> 02:21:11,533
shattering crack sound hits, and you watch as one
large, snaking, carving line begins to work its

1872
02:21:11,533 --> 02:21:19,400
way up one side of the tower. Up another. And the
collective gasp of hundreds of voices across the

1873
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:32,850
city seem to echo, (gasps). You watch as one side
buckles, and the tower begins to slowly (rumble)

1874
02:21:32,850 --> 02:21:36,548
to the ground.

1875
02:21:36,548 --> 02:21:38,494
SAM: Is it falling towards us?

1876
02:21:38,494 --> 02:21:40,249
MATT: It's falling not towards you.

1877
02:21:40,249 --> 02:21:43,687
ASHLEY: We thought of that.

1878
02:21:43,687 --> 02:21:46,147
MATT: But not the entire tower.

1879
02:21:46,147 --> 02:21:47,632
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1880
02:21:47,632 --> 02:21:56,983
MATT: You glance up and watch as the very apex,
the three-clawed top of the tower, is just there,

1881
02:21:56,983 --> 02:22:06,242
in the sky, held aloft, unmoving, as the rest of
the tower seems to have (rumble) broken away, and

1882
02:22:06,242 --> 02:22:14,549
as it falls, this slow, terrifying collapse, you
hear the rumbling of broken stone slamming into

1883
02:22:14,549 --> 02:22:20,517
earth as clouds of smoke, dust, and dead earth are
kicked up from the impact of this falling tower,

1884
02:22:20,517 --> 02:22:27,384
completely enswirling the center of the city with
debris and darkness. You watch as cultists go

1885
02:22:27,384 --> 02:22:32,370
running now, their faces filled with fear and
confusion at what this suddenly means, what's

1886
02:22:32,370 --> 02:22:42,956
happening. As the dust washes past you, it gives
this haze over the sky, and slowly comes to fade.

1887
02:22:42,956 --> 02:22:56,791
You all, taking in what's happening, watch as that
one apex of the spire slowly makes its way down to

1888
02:22:56,791 --> 02:23:05,744
the surface of wherever you are on top of the
rubble that once stood as Entropis.

1889
02:23:05,744 --> 02:23:07,650
MARISHA: It kind of worked.

1890
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:09,371
SAM: I mean, it wasn't bad.

1891
02:23:09,371 --> 02:23:15,877
MARISHA: It brought it down. Did anyone of
significance die in the process?

1892
02:23:15,877 --> 02:23:18,315
MATT: You can only assume.

1893
02:23:18,315 --> 02:23:19,946
LAURA: Can we see who it is?

1894
02:23:19,946 --> 02:23:22,308
MATT: You're too far away. You're 500 feet away
from this.

1895
02:23:22,308 --> 02:23:23,782
SAM: Let's go.

1896
02:23:23,782 --> 02:23:26,383
LAURA: Let's go.

1897
02:23:26,383 --> 02:23:29,697
TALIESIN: Broom.

1898
02:23:29,697 --> 02:23:33,130
TRAVIS: We're going up to it or waiting till it
comes down all the way?

1899
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:35,060
SAM: Oh, I mean, it's landing, right?

1900
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:40,018
MATT: It's landed. It settled itself. It's kind of
cocked to one side. For it to land in the rubble,

1901
02:23:40,018 --> 02:23:46,133
it's not a perfect platform, it (rumble) and comes
to rest at a very faint angle among the ruined,

1902
02:23:46,133 --> 02:23:55,521
broken, jagged obsidian pile. It's a thousand
million flecked arrowheads all jumbled in this

1903
02:23:55,521 --> 02:24:03,111
broken glass-like landscape of destroyed tower,
and there, the very zenith of this once-grand

1904
02:24:03,111 --> 02:24:05,280
structure sits resting, waiting.

1905
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,183
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

1906
02:24:07,183 --> 02:24:10,190
SAM: Do we have an escape plan?

1907
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:12,187
TRAVIS: Kill everything.

1908
02:24:12,187 --> 02:24:17,839
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift us if things get really
bad, but I kind of think

1909
02:24:17,839 --> 02:24:20,077
we're already on our plane.

1910
02:24:20,077 --> 02:24:26,292
LAURA: This sounds like we're all going to die!

1911
02:24:26,292 --> 02:24:27,950
SAM: Sure does.

1912
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:30,013
ASHLEY: All right, guys, we're going to do this.
We're going to do this.

1913
02:24:30,013 --> 02:24:31,773
LIAM: Start walking.

1914
02:24:31,773 --> 02:24:35,212
TALIESIN: The minute I grab onto your broom, you
can't hear anything, so I'm just going to ride it

1915
02:24:35,212 --> 02:24:36,951
down to the ground and then let go.

1916
02:24:36,951 --> 02:24:38,409
LAURA: Okay.

1917
02:24:38,409 --> 02:24:43,081
TRAVIS: Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to
take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them

1918
02:24:43,081 --> 02:24:45,165
together and cast Enlarge on myself.

1919
02:24:45,165 --> 02:24:50,189
MATT: Your cloak tears around your body,
Incredible Hulk style as your form ruins what

1920
02:24:50,189 --> 02:24:56,058
remains of the black, sheared fabric that once,
even by the stretch of the imagination,

1921
02:24:56,058 --> 02:24:58,369
pseudo-hid you, now...

1922
02:24:58,369 --> 02:24:59,483
TRAVIS: A bib remains.

1923
02:24:59,483 --> 02:25:07,183
MATT: Exactly. It's almost like one of those
Chippendale neckpieces. What you see is a number

1924
02:25:07,183 --> 02:25:12,352
of cultists that were running away from the tower
stop and see this, and then, almost instinctually,

1925
02:25:12,352 --> 02:25:18,330
go to defend. Make an intimidation check.

1926
02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:22,388
TRAVIS: Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24.

1927
02:25:22,388 --> 02:25:29,190
MATT: And go scattering in other directions. You
see some are rushing towards the tower to see what

1928
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:35,580
happened, to see if anyone's okay. There are a lot
of cultists that were crushed, you imagine, on

1929
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:40,642
that side of the city, especially since they were
clustering at the base for whatever this was. But

1930
02:25:40,642 --> 02:25:45,682
many more are still out in the streets as you guys
walk (footsteps),

1931
02:25:45,682 --> 02:25:47,854
making your way towards the central tower.

1932
02:25:47,854 --> 02:25:52,793
LAURA: I take off the robes. Get ready. Slow
motion walk towards the tower.

1933
02:25:52,793 --> 02:26:04,064
MATT: You make your way down the ruined city
streets of Thar Amphala. Amongst the snowfall

1934
02:26:04,064 --> 02:26:09,234
that's now beginning to gather on the tops of your
heads and your shoulders and your wings, and along

1935
02:26:09,234 --> 02:26:17,482
the sides of the street that hadn't seen snowfall,
probably ever. You make your way past the final

1936
02:26:17,482 --> 02:26:24,715
boundary buildings, the cultists just letting you
pass, looks of fear, looks of excitement, looks of

1937
02:26:24,715 --> 02:26:31,250
knowing, looks of understanding that you probably
walk to your deaths and I want to watch this

1938
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:37,352
happen. You begin to step over the rubble, your
footfalls finding the grinding, high-pitched

1939
02:26:37,352 --> 02:26:48,426
cracks of broken glass-like obsidian beneath your
feet. There you look up, and can see about 25 or

1940
02:26:48,426 --> 02:26:56,008
30 feet of the tower top is resting at an angle.
You can't see what's up on top of it. No windows.

1941
02:26:56,008 --> 02:26:58,243
How do you wish to proceed?

1942
02:26:58,243 --> 02:27:05,434
LIAM: We're not sneaking up on shit.

1943
02:27:05,434 --> 02:27:08,938
LAURA: Well, no. They know we're here.

1944
02:27:08,938 --> 02:27:13,801
TRAVIS: Circle? Flank? All together? Which one?

1945
02:27:13,801 --> 02:27:17,669
TALIESIN: Powerhouses together. Distance fighters
keep their distance.

1946
02:27:17,669 --> 02:27:19,735
I'll take the carpet if it's available.

1947
02:27:19,735 --> 02:27:21,883
LAURA: Surround the tower, climb up each side?

1948
02:27:21,883 --> 02:27:23,024
TRAVIS: I would.

1949
02:27:23,024 --> 02:27:26,510
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the carpet. Anybody
who wants a lift up, feel free.

1950
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:28,422
TRAVIS: I will take that ride.

1951
02:27:28,422 --> 02:27:30,696
LAURA: I'll broom it.

1952
02:27:30,696 --> 02:27:32,696
ASHLEY: I'll hop up on the carpet.

1953
02:27:32,696 --> 02:27:34,439
TALIESIN: Carpet's full.

1954
02:27:34,439 --> 02:27:41,351
MATT: As you guys are getting yourselves prepared,
that voice returns to you, echoing through your

1955
02:27:41,351 --> 02:27:43,274
minds once again.

1956
02:27:43,274 --> 02:28:00,278
"I am genuinely impressed. I'm
excited. And I would like for you to remain to

1957
02:28:00,278 --> 02:28:18,355
"watch my ascension, but far be it for me to rob
anyone of a fine death, so come. Come, and be the

1958
02:28:18,355 --> 02:28:22,931
"next sacrifice for the new age."

1959
02:28:22,931 --> 02:28:28,029
LAURA: You're a dipshit!

1960
02:28:28,029 --> 02:28:32,082
TRAVIS: Eloquence personified.

1961
02:28:32,082 --> 02:28:36,652
MATT: So, via broom...

1962
02:28:36,652 --> 02:28:39,342
SAM: We have to fly to get up to it?

1963
02:28:39,342 --> 02:28:40,968
LAURA: It's 35 feet up, so.

1964
02:28:40,968 --> 02:28:42,483
MARISHA: To the top of the tower?

1965
02:28:42,483 --> 02:28:44,614
TRAVIS: Platform, whatever you want to call it.

1966
02:28:44,614 --> 02:28:46,792
LIAM: I'm going to shoot up and past by quite a
bit.

1967
02:28:46,792 --> 02:28:48,765
MARISHA: Can I hop on a carpet or broom?

1968
02:28:48,765 --> 02:28:50,236
LAURA: You can hop on my broom.

1969
02:28:50,236 --> 02:28:51,750
TALIESIN: I was about to say, carpet's a bit
full.

1970
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:53,381
MARISHA: I'll hop on the broom with Vex.

1971
02:28:53,381 --> 02:28:54,991
SAM: I need a ride as well.

1972
02:28:54,991 --> 02:28:56,867
TALIESIN: Once I'm up, I'm going to scatter.

1973
02:28:56,867 --> 02:29:02,992
SAM: Do you want me to be a beholder? Or a
dragon?

1974
02:29:02,992 --> 02:29:09,018
MARISHA: Beholder has the anti-magic cone eye
situation. Just wait and see.

1975
02:29:09,018 --> 02:29:13,186
SAM: Wait and see? Figured I should do it now.

1976
02:29:13,186 --> 02:29:15,482
TALIESIN: How long can you maintain a beholder?

1977
02:29:15,482 --> 02:29:17,200
MARISHA: How long does it last to cast?

1978
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,831
SAM: It's instantaneous.

1979
02:29:18,831 --> 02:29:20,927
TALIESIN: Oh, then wait until the moment that it's
necessary.

1980
02:29:20,927 --> 02:29:25,383
SAM: But he could Counterspell it unless I do it
now.

1981
02:29:25,383 --> 02:29:27,738
LAURA: I don't know if he's actually here yet.

1982
02:29:27,738 --> 02:29:36,316
MATT: Help me put this down right... There.

1983
02:29:36,316 --> 02:29:45,737
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

1984
02:29:45,737 --> 02:29:51,484
LAURA: I feel like whenever we come across a map,
I feel like we walked into his hand, exactly where

1985
02:29:51,484 --> 02:29:52,580
he wanted us.

1986
02:29:52,580 --> 02:29:54,302
TRAVIS: Let's also talk about the fact that it's
been years since we've been this close to a map.

1987
02:29:54,302 --> 02:29:55,514
MATT: This is also true.

1988
02:29:55,514 --> 02:29:56,641
TALIESIN: That is true.

1989
02:29:56,641 --> 02:30:05,713
MATT: Please. Indulge me where you're coming in
from. And these resemble the three curved spires.

1990
02:30:05,713 --> 02:30:10,956
TRAVIS: Those ideally go like that above it,
right?

1991
02:30:10,956 --> 02:30:12,871
MATT: Yeah, they curve upward and stop about
there.

1992
02:30:12,871 --> 02:30:14,418
TALIESIN: So they're not platform-y.

1993
02:30:14,418 --> 02:30:16,944
MATT: No. They come to a point.

1994
02:30:16,944 --> 02:30:27,853
TALIESIN: I'm hiding behind this glowing spire.
I'm going to take some cover behind.

1995
02:30:27,853 --> 02:30:32,036
MATT: You rush. We're looking for landing
placement, here. This'll come into play, here.

1996
02:30:32,036 --> 02:30:33,691
Grog, where are you going?

1997
02:30:33,691 --> 02:30:36,671
TRAVIS: I'll go right there.

1998
02:30:36,671 --> 02:30:38,643
MATT: Right there.

1999
02:30:38,643 --> 02:30:41,922
LAURA: Me and Keyleth-- do you want to land over
here?

2000
02:30:41,922 --> 02:30:44,354
MARISHA: That's fine. Yeah, I follow your lead.

2001
02:30:44,354 --> 02:30:48,813
LAURA: As soon as I land, I bamf Trinket out.

2002
02:30:48,813 --> 02:30:54,248
MATT: Vax.

2003
02:30:54,248 --> 02:31:07,270
LIAM: I'm going to say that I'm about 80 feet in
the air, just off-center. Towards Vex and Keyleth,

2004
02:31:07,270 --> 02:31:13,342
but just off-center.

2005
02:31:13,342 --> 02:31:16,822
LAURA: Keep a distance, don't be in a line with
us.

2006
02:31:16,822 --> 02:31:19,866
LIAM: I'm going to say I'm there, straight up.

2007
02:31:19,866 --> 02:31:25,924
MATT: There you are, Vax, right there.

2008
02:31:25,924 --> 02:31:30,144
TRAVIS: The minis look so cool!

2009
02:31:30,144 --> 02:31:32,413
TALIESIN: I haven't seen them in so long.

2010
02:31:32,413 --> 02:31:34,124
TRAVIS: I know, we've been so far away!

2011
02:31:34,124 --> 02:31:35,589
TALIESIN: Who's left? Pike?

2012
02:31:35,589 --> 02:31:40,056
MATT: Pike and Scanlan. Because you took the
carpet, you're going to have to be near Grog for

2013
02:31:40,056 --> 02:31:45,106
where you guys land. Going to be the circumstance
there. Percy,

2014
02:31:45,106 --> 02:31:46,761
you just run up the side to get there?

2015
02:31:46,761 --> 02:31:50,412
TALIESIN: No, I was on the carpet and hopped and
left them because they had to go pick up.

2016
02:31:50,412 --> 02:31:52,763
MATT: If that's the case, then I'll say that
you're landing.

2017
02:31:52,763 --> 02:31:54,099
TALIESIN: No, they had to go get Scanlan--

2018
02:31:54,099 --> 02:31:56,381
MATT: Oh, you had to go get Scanlan?

2019
02:31:56,381 --> 02:31:57,807
TALIESIN: It's 35 feet.

2020
02:31:57,807 --> 02:32:00,146
MATT: If you guys had leave Scanlan behind, that's
a whole different thing.

2021
02:32:00,146 --> 02:32:03,757
SAM: No, I think I'm going to just go ahead and be
a beholder and fly in there myself.

2022
02:32:03,757 --> 02:32:05,335
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll work.

2023
02:32:05,335 --> 02:32:06,787
MATT: Okay!

2024
02:32:06,787 --> 02:32:13,122
TRAVIS: Wow! Okay! All right! YOLO, why the fuck
not?

2025
02:32:13,122 --> 02:32:19,942
TALIESIN: If you'd be so kind, throw me here,
then.

2026
02:32:19,942 --> 02:32:23,169
LIAM: Someday, we could have a game with two
beholders on our side.

2027
02:32:23,169 --> 02:32:26,540
MARISHA: It's true! But not today.

2028
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:28,434
MATT: That's Scanlan.

2029
02:32:28,434 --> 02:32:31,061
(laughter)

2030
02:32:31,061 --> 02:32:35,996
TALIESIN: I like that you found a goofy-looking
beholder. (goofy voice) Hi!

2031
02:32:35,996 --> 02:32:39,281
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Hey, you guys!

2032
02:32:39,281 --> 02:32:51,349
MATT: As you guys arrive, the floor is just
surrounded in bodies. Cultists of very ornate

2033
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:56,965
robes. Mostly you've seen peon-based: black
splatters of sackcloth, what was available.

2034
02:32:56,965 --> 02:32:58,703
LAURA: They've been <i>peed</i> on?!

2035
02:32:58,703 --> 02:33:05,946
MATT: No. these are well-adorned and appear to
have been very well-regarded within the Remnants.

2036
02:33:05,946 --> 02:33:15,075
You also see, on this side, what appears to be--
sorry, on this side would be Delilah Briarwood.

2037
02:33:15,075 --> 02:33:16,981
LAURA: Bitchface Briarwood.

2038
02:33:16,981 --> 02:33:18,773
MARISHA: Bitchface Briarwood!

2039
02:33:18,773 --> 02:33:27,816
MATT: On this side, you see what appears to be a
black, armored, massive, not quite goliath-sized,

2040
02:33:27,816 --> 02:33:41,526
but a thick, dark black knight of jagged dark
metal armor, what appears to be a longsword that

2041
02:33:41,526 --> 02:33:52,630
emanates this dark energy, and floating above--

2042
02:33:52,630 --> 02:34:01,897
TALIESIN: Oh, balls.

2043
02:34:01,897 --> 02:34:03,956
LAURA: Oh no, what's flying?

2044
02:34:03,956 --> 02:34:05,518
ASHLEY: Put it away.

2045
02:34:05,518 --> 02:34:07,607
LAURA: No, I don't need it!

2046
02:34:07,607 --> 02:34:10,131
LIAM: Those are my platforms, I can take them back
anytime I want!

2047
02:34:10,131 --> 02:34:12,493
LAURA: Oh no! What is that?

2048
02:34:12,493 --> 02:34:27,619
MATT: You see a man, though the flesh is pulled
tight against a skeletal frame. You see long, red

2049
02:34:27,619 --> 02:34:34,112
and purple and black robes that are tattered and
drift below the breeze and cold gently blowing by.

2050
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:42,146
You see a field of crackling energy just bursting
around the outskirts of his form. You see one hand

2051
02:34:42,146 --> 02:34:50,405
is out, in a welcoming position, while the empty
wrist that once contained a hand is now open on

2052
02:34:50,405 --> 02:34:58,332
the other side. You see the bald, hairless head,
which is covered in spots and tugged open, bits of

2053
02:34:58,332 --> 02:35:04,124
flesh that have curled away from rotten decay. You
see the cheeks sunken in where the skeletal teeth

2054
02:35:04,124 --> 02:35:13,417
are now emblazoned in a terrible grin. You see the
right eye, and the gaping hole where a bright

2055
02:35:13,417 --> 02:35:22,276
green, bursting, flaming vacuous void where an eye
once was now drifts off a trail behind it. You see

2056
02:35:22,276 --> 02:35:33,925
there, reborn before you, the Whispered One, the
Undying King. Vecna himself.

2057
02:35:33,925 --> 02:35:35,810
TRAVIS: Oh god, we're in it!

2058
02:35:35,810 --> 02:35:37,328
TALIESIN: I don't like it being this close.

2059
02:35:37,406 --> 02:35:38,676
SAM: We'll probably all die.

2060
02:35:38,676 --> 02:35:40,206
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

2061
02:35:40,206 --> 02:35:42,220
(screaming)

2062
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:43,236
TRAVIS: No!

2063
02:35:43,236 --> 02:35:47,485
SAM: Matthew Mercer, may I borrow your Monster
Manual so I know what I am?

2064
02:35:47,485 --> 02:35:51,816
MATT: Marisha actually has a page for it, if you
want that.

2065
02:35:51,816 --> 02:35:53,930
MARISHA: I do have a page. Do you want my beholder
page?

2066
02:35:53,930 --> 02:35:55,176
SAM: Yeah!

2067
02:35:55,176 --> 02:35:56,514
TALIESIN: That's terrible.

2068
02:35:56,514 --> 02:35:58,034
MARISHA: That's terrible for me, too.

2069
02:35:58,034 --> 02:35:59,441
LAURA: My teeth hurt.

2070
02:35:59,441 --> 02:36:01,196
MATT: My teeth hurt?!

2071
02:36:01,196 --> 02:36:08,988
TALIESIN: That's terrible. I'm not okay with that
roll.

2072
02:36:08,988 --> 02:36:11,348
MARISHA: Oh, give me that back page. Sorry.

2073
02:36:11,348 --> 02:36:12,739
TALIESIN: Back page.

2074
02:36:12,739 --> 02:36:16,851
SAM: It doesn't say what his initiative is.

2075
02:36:16,851 --> 02:36:25,040
TALIESIN: You have to roll. It's a dex modifier
plus a d20 if you don't have initiative?

2076
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:26,675
MATT: What's that?

2077
02:36:26,675 --> 02:36:28,644
TALIESIN: Your initiative is normal.

2078
02:36:28,644 --> 02:36:32,107
MATT: Your initiative is whatever the creature's
initiative is, which is its dex modifier.

2079
02:36:32,107 --> 02:36:33,733
SAM: Okay. All right.

2080
02:36:33,733 --> 02:36:35,105
TALIESIN: Plus a d20.

2081
02:36:35,105 --> 02:36:36,168
SAM: 11.

2082
02:36:36,168 --> 02:36:38,713
LIAM: When was the last time we went to bed?

2083
02:36:38,713 --> 02:36:41,280
LAURA: I mean, it's a normal amount of time.

2084
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,541
LIAM: No, I mean, like, right before coming? I
can't remember the last time we had a full rest.

2085
02:36:44,541 --> 02:36:53,196
MATT: A full rest would have been maybe four or
five hours ago.

2086
02:36:53,196 --> 02:36:57,014
LIAM: Okay. I think I have all my Lucks. That's
why I'm asking.

2087
02:36:57,014 --> 02:36:59,628
TALIESIN: I don't think you've burned since we've
come through.

2088
02:36:59,628 --> 02:37:01,256
LIAM: Not 100% sure.

2089
02:37:01,321 --> 02:37:03,092
MARISHA: I also gave you advantage on everything.

2090
02:37:03,092 --> 02:37:04,622
LIAM: I know it! Girl!

2091
02:37:04,622 --> 02:37:06,587
MARISHA: I think you didn't use anything.

2092
02:37:06,587 --> 02:37:12,434
MATT: Initiative order. 25 to 20?

2093
02:37:12,434 --> 02:37:16,022
TRAVIS: 20. Shit.

2094
02:37:16,022 --> 02:37:18,323
MATT: Fuck, guys. Guys.

2095
02:37:18,323 --> 02:37:21,022
TRAVIS: Me?! Okay.

2096
02:37:21,022 --> 02:37:25,809
LAURA: I have no plan!

2097
02:37:25,809 --> 02:37:28,868
ASHLEY: We're fully Leeroy Jenkins-ing.

2098
02:37:28,868 --> 02:37:33,085
LAURA: Fully. Leeroy Jenkins!

2099
02:37:33,085 --> 02:37:40,322
MATT: Grog, what's your dex?

2100
02:37:40,322 --> 02:37:43,966
TRAVIS: My dexterity? 15.

2101
02:37:43,966 --> 02:37:49,079
MATT: Okay. Technically, you rolled the same
initiative as the death knight,

2102
02:37:49,079 --> 02:37:51,394
so he'll go right after you.

2103
02:37:51,394 --> 02:37:59,913
TRAVIS: Okay. The death knight, by the way, is
what Colonel Arnold Fuck is.

2104
02:37:59,913 --> 02:38:01,465
MATT: 20 to 15.

2105
02:38:01,465 --> 02:38:02,517
LIAM: 16.

2106
02:38:02,517 --> 02:38:03,752
LAURA: 18.

2107
02:38:03,752 --> 02:38:05,117
ASHLEY: 17.

2108
02:38:05,117 --> 02:38:06,541
LAURA: Ooh, nice!

2109
02:38:06,541 --> 02:38:09,296
MATT: You had 18, 17.

2110
02:38:09,296 --> 02:38:18,280
LIAM: 16. Sylas, broomstick-up-his-ass, death
knight Briarwood.

2111
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:21,057
SAM: 11.

2112
02:38:21,057 --> 02:38:22,763
TALIESIN: 13.

2113
02:38:22,763 --> 02:38:28,416
LAURA: This first round is definitely a surprise
attack on them, right?

2114
02:38:28,416 --> 02:38:30,310
MATT: Oh yeah! Totally!

2115
02:38:30,310 --> 02:38:31,406
MARISHA: Seven.

2116
02:38:31,406 --> 02:38:33,760
TALIESIN: They did not see this shit coming. At
all.

2117
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:38,991
MATT: All righty. So.

2118
02:38:38,991 --> 02:38:48,245
MARISHA: I had so much hope when we took down
their tower. It went away very quickly.

2119
02:38:48,245 --> 02:38:51,400
TALIESIN: It did, but I think that probably made a
lot of cultists go away.

2120
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:54,228
LIAM: Guys, we've got to start the new campaign
sometime.

2121
02:38:54,228 --> 02:38:58,629
MATT: Okay. Beginning of the round.

2122
02:38:58,629 --> 02:39:03,207
MARISHA: We all die.

2123
02:39:03,207 --> 02:39:10,535
TALIESIN: I cast Game Over. 20th-level spell.

2124
02:39:10,535 --> 02:39:12,060
MATT: So many options.

2125
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:13,575
(groaning)

2126
02:39:13,575 --> 02:39:15,115
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

2127
02:39:15,115 --> 02:39:24,165
LIAM: We're going to die. Yep!

2128
02:39:24,165 --> 02:39:27,874
TRAVIS: Obviously, we're not at the top of the
round.

2129
02:39:27,874 --> 02:39:38,655
MATT: Okay, so. Vecna, as he stands there, seeing
the beholder arrive over the edge, seeing the

2130
02:39:38,655 --> 02:39:42,862
paladin in the sky, seeing the rest of these
individuals cluster in, goes,

2131
02:39:42,862 --> 02:39:49,398
"Very well. I wanted to talk more. Please, sit."

2132
02:39:49,398 --> 02:40:11,581
I need Scanlan, Vax, Grog, Keyleth, and Vex 
to all make wisdom saving throws, please.

2133
02:40:11,581 --> 02:40:12,922
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2134
02:40:12,995 --> 02:40:15,022
MARISHA: Ugh, should have done that fucking
Feast!

2135
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:16,461
LAURA: We knew we were going to say it.

2136
02:40:16,461 --> 02:40:19,704
SAM: Shit, I'm gonna lose my fucking
9th-level spell.

2137
02:40:19,704 --> 02:40:21,725
ASHLEY: Not necessarily!

2138
02:40:21,725 --> 02:40:23,854
MARISHA: 13.

2139
02:40:23,854 --> 02:40:25,931
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, yeah. A natural 19.

2140
02:40:25,931 --> 02:40:29,747
LAURA: I have a feeling I have to roll really high
against fucking Vecna!

2141
02:40:29,747 --> 02:40:31,537
TALIESIN: Do you have a Luck?

2142
02:40:31,537 --> 02:40:34,144
LAURA: Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan.

2143
02:40:34,144 --> 02:40:39,084
SAM: Neither have Luck. I'm a beholder.

2144
02:40:39,084 --> 02:40:40,839
TALIESIN: No, you have all of your other stuff.

2145
02:40:40,839 --> 02:40:42,242
SAM: Are you sure about that?

2146
02:40:42,242 --> 02:40:43,661
MARISHA: Is it like Shapechange?

2147
02:40:43,661 --> 02:40:48,226
SAM: This is True Polymorph. I am this creature.

2148
02:40:48,226 --> 02:40:50,507
MARISHA: Oh, it's True Polymorph.

2149
02:40:50,507 --> 02:40:51,600
MATT: He is that creature.

2150
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:52,655
LIAM: That's hot.

2151
02:40:52,655 --> 02:40:54,328
SAM: Except it's not, because I'm about to not be
anymore.

2152
02:40:54,328 --> 02:40:56,066
LAURA: Because he's going to cancel it.

2153
02:40:56,066 --> 02:40:57,251
MATT: So.

2154
02:40:57,251 --> 02:40:58,816
SAM: 18.

2155
02:40:58,816 --> 02:41:01,620
LIAM: God damn it.

2156
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,010
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

2157
02:41:03,010 --> 02:41:04,195
MARISHA: 27.

2158
02:41:04,195 --> 02:41:05,998
MATT: You resist.

2159
02:41:05,998 --> 02:41:07,314
LIAM: 18.

2160
02:41:07,314 --> 02:41:09,548
LAURA: Oh god, you have to roll so high in order
to resist.

2161
02:41:09,548 --> 02:41:12,143
SAM: Even with advantage? Oh, fuck.

2162
02:41:12,143 --> 02:41:13,564
TRAVIS: 19.

2163
02:41:13,564 --> 02:41:17,467
MARISHA: They roll disadvantage against you, too.

2164
02:41:17,467 --> 02:41:21,291
TALIESIN: Oh, you didn't say me.

2165
02:41:21,291 --> 02:41:25,013
LAURA: You skipped me. And I rolled a 20.

2166
02:41:25,058 --> 02:41:27,904
MARISHA: You rolled a 20?

2167
02:41:27,904 --> 02:41:36,207
MATT: You feel the force of his magical prowess
coalesce like a cold vise on your brain, and your

2168
02:41:36,207 --> 02:41:49,228
body seizes, holding taut. And you're all held.
You fall straight down 80 feet.

2169
02:41:49,228 --> 02:41:50,640
MARISHA: Oh, no.

2170
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:56,207
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) Oh, fuck! Oh man!

2171
02:41:56,207 --> 02:41:59,054
MARISHA: None of us can do anything to help him?

2172
02:41:59,054 --> 02:42:03,019
LAURA: We slow-motion walked into our own death.

2173
02:42:03,019 --> 02:42:05,083
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

2174
02:42:05,083 --> 02:42:06,350
SAM: Is Pike out?

2175
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:13,229
MATT: Take 32 points of bludgeoning damage, Vax.
And you are-- Oh god!

2176
02:42:13,229 --> 02:42:15,142
LAURA: Walls brought down.

2177
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:17,659
MATT: Prone, there.

2178
02:42:17,659 --> 02:42:19,105
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

2179
02:42:19,105 --> 02:42:22,221
MATT: The rest of you are also held.

2180
02:42:22,221 --> 02:42:25,244
TRAVIS: Is this charmed or frightened?

2181
02:42:25,244 --> 02:42:27,391
MATT: No.

2182
02:42:27,391 --> 02:42:28,886
TRAVIS: Okay, it's not.

2183
02:42:28,886 --> 02:42:30,467
LAURA: What does being held mean?

2184
02:42:30,467 --> 02:42:31,796
LIAM: It's paralysis.

2185
02:42:31,796 --> 02:42:38,342
TALIESIN: Until we save, or until his
concentration is broken, I assume.

2186
02:42:38,342 --> 02:42:39,282
MATT: Correct.

2187
02:42:39,282 --> 02:42:40,784
TRAVIS: And rage would have no effect on this?

2188
02:42:40,784 --> 02:42:41,727
MATT: Nope!

2189
02:42:41,727 --> 02:42:43,245
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

2190
02:42:43,245 --> 02:42:54,179
MATT: And he's going to go ahead and shift up
about 20 more feet and kind of glance over the

2191
02:42:54,179 --> 02:42:56,220
battlefield a bit.

2192
02:42:56,220 --> 02:43:00,286
SAM: He's a god! He's a golden god!

2193
02:43:00,286 --> 02:43:03,925
TRAVIS: He actually is one. And he won't jump off a
1000-foot cliff.

2194
02:43:03,925 --> 02:43:07,683
MATT: (chuckles) Apparently. All right.

2195
02:43:07,683 --> 02:43:11,703
LAURA: T minus ten minutes until he turns into a
goldfish.

2196
02:43:11,703 --> 02:43:15,694
MARISHA: We can only be so hopeful.

2197
02:43:15,694 --> 02:43:17,364
LAURA: That's plenty of time for us to die.

2198
02:43:17,364 --> 02:43:19,616
MATT: That ends his turn. Delilah's now going to
go.

2199
02:43:19,616 --> 02:43:21,105
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh, good!

2200
02:43:21,105 --> 02:43:23,140
TRAVIS: Wow, what a way to lead off the round!

2201
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:27,034
SAM: My anti-magic cone is not in effect, I
assume?

2202
02:43:27,034 --> 02:43:31,357
TALIESIN: Actually, isn't it just naturally
wherever they're looking?

2203
02:43:31,357 --> 02:43:34,981
MATT: It's wherever you're facing, but he hasn't
had a turn to go yet, he basically just arrived.

2204
02:43:34,981 --> 02:43:36,762
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

2205
02:43:36,762 --> 02:43:45,433
MATT: So it would be kind of in this path here,
wherever you would have come in in this regard. So

2206
02:43:45,433 --> 02:43:47,774
it would be this direction.

2207
02:43:47,774 --> 02:43:49,945
LIAM: It's a big fuckin' headlamp.

2208
02:43:49,945 --> 02:44:00,455
SAM: (laughs) Just frozen there. I really want to
swallow and I can't close--

2209
02:44:00,455 --> 02:44:03,604
TALIESIN: I was under the impression that the
eyeball was passive.

2210
02:44:03,604 --> 02:44:05,408
MATT: I'm checking right now, actually.

2211
02:44:05,408 --> 02:44:09,426
SAM: Well, you have to choose. At the start of
each turn--

2212
02:44:09,426 --> 02:44:12,277
MATT: At the start of its turn, which way the cone
faces and whether the cone is active.

2213
02:44:12,277 --> 02:44:14,147
SAM: I haven't had a turn.

2214
02:44:14,147 --> 02:44:15,923
MARISHA: And if it's active?

2215
02:44:15,923 --> 02:44:20,198
TALIESIN: You're holding your action for being
able to move.

2216
02:44:20,198 --> 02:44:21,720
MATT: Anyway.

2217
02:44:21,720 --> 02:44:25,466
TRAVIS: Hey, so... (laughs)

2218
02:44:25,513 --> 02:44:28,389
SAM: We got this, guys. How many of us are still
able to move?

2219
02:44:28,389 --> 02:44:30,291
MATT: Three of you.

2220
02:44:30,291 --> 02:44:31,730
SAM: Hey! Okay!

2221
02:44:31,730 --> 02:44:35,920
TRAVIS: Looking up! Things are looking up. He has
12 hit points, by the way.

2222
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,664
MARISHA: Being held. What's the deal with that?

2223
02:44:37,664 --> 02:44:41,936
MATT: You're paralyzed. Which means you are
incapacitated, you automatically fail strength and

2224
02:44:41,936 --> 02:44:45,716
dexterity saving throws, attack rolls against you
have advantage, and any creature that hits you

2225
02:44:45,716 --> 02:44:47,687
within five feet, it's a critical hit.

2226
02:44:47,687 --> 02:44:51,572
TRAVIS: Basically worst scenario possible. That's
all you had to say: worst scenario possible.

2227
02:44:51,572 --> 02:44:54,731
TALIESIN: It could be worse, but it would take
math. This is bad.

2228
02:44:54,731 --> 02:44:58,878
SAM: Pike's going to solve everything.

2229
02:44:58,878 --> 02:45:00,416
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah.

2230
02:45:00,416 --> 02:45:01,801
SAM: Yeah, she can get us out of this.

2231
02:45:01,801 --> 02:45:03,199
LIAM: Flipping those pages.

2232
02:45:03,199 --> 02:45:11,542
TRAVIS: Remember this look, boys and girls. On
Matt's face. As the chef carefully

2233
02:45:11,774 --> 02:45:14,006
picks the menu of our-- Yes.

2234
02:45:14,006 --> 02:45:16,108
LAURA: Of our destruction? Of our doom?

2235
02:45:16,108 --> 02:45:18,784
TALIESIN: He has been grooming us and fattening us
up for two years.

2236
02:45:18,784 --> 02:45:20,988
MATT: Delilah is going to move.

2237
02:45:20,988 --> 02:45:24,335
SAM: Oh no, lair action, she explodes.

2238
02:45:24,335 --> 02:45:27,016
(laughter)

2239
02:45:27,016 --> 02:45:35,029
MATT: And is going to step over Vax's body on the
ground.

2240
02:45:35,029 --> 02:45:37,228
MARISHA: Oh, bitch! You better back off, bitch!

2241
02:45:37,228 --> 02:45:39,890
LAURA: Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch,
because he just looked up your skirt!

2242
02:45:39,890 --> 02:45:42,227
MATT: And looks at you.

2243
02:45:42,227 --> 02:45:43,765
LAURA: (small voice) Me?

2244
02:45:43,765 --> 02:45:45,512
MATT: It's been a while, my dear.

2245
02:45:45,512 --> 02:45:48,881
(yelling)

2246
02:45:48,881 --> 02:45:56,622
LAURA: No! Why would you do this?! How you do dis
Matt?!

2247
02:45:56,622 --> 02:45:58,323
MATT: Yep, so make a constitution saving throw.

2248
02:45:58,323 --> 02:45:59,743
LAURA: No!

2249
02:45:59,743 --> 02:46:01,981
MATT: You're held, but you still make a
constitution roll.

2250
02:46:01,981 --> 02:46:03,293
MARISHA: Come on...

2251
02:46:03,293 --> 02:46:05,287
ASHLEY: Matt, how do you do this?!

2252
02:46:05,287 --> 02:46:06,702
TRAVIS: Come on.

2253
02:46:06,702 --> 02:46:08,051
MARISHA: Not again.

2254
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:09,190
LAURA: Natural 20!

2255
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:10,770
(cheering)

2256
02:46:10,770 --> 02:46:12,261
MATT: No way!

2257
02:46:12,261 --> 02:46:15,668
LIAM: And I said, biiiiitch.

2258
02:46:15,668 --> 02:46:18,320
MATT: So you take half as much damage, which is
good.

2259
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:20,388
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2260
02:46:20,388 --> 02:46:23,193
LAURA: Oh, I'm really glad we healed.

2261
02:46:23,193 --> 02:46:30,169
LIAM: Vax on the ground just starts going
(unintelligible yells).

2262
02:46:30,169 --> 02:46:32,729
MATT: All right, so instead of 61 points of
necrotic damage,

2263
02:46:32,729 --> 02:46:34,390
you take 30 points of necrotic damage.

2264
02:46:34,434 --> 02:46:35,996
LIAM: I'm shaking, guys.

2265
02:46:35,996 --> 02:46:37,388
TALIESIN: Leroy!

2266
02:46:37,388 --> 02:46:43,358
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2267
02:46:43,358 --> 02:46:46,043
LIAM: Got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up.

2268
02:46:46,043 --> 02:46:49,312
LAURA: Ow, ow.

2269
02:46:49,312 --> 02:46:51,208
MATT: You okay?

2270
02:46:51,208 --> 02:46:52,712
LAURA: (whimpering) I'm good.

2271
02:46:52,712 --> 02:46:54,212
TRAVIS: Blood pressure's a thing right now.

2272
02:46:54,212 --> 02:46:56,469
MATT: That'll end her turn. Grog.

2273
02:46:56,469 --> 02:46:57,622
LIAM: Holy shit, Grog.

2274
02:46:57,622 --> 02:46:59,872
MATT: Your turn happens at the same time the lair
action happens.

2275
02:46:59,872 --> 02:47:01,828
TRAVIS: And the Death Knight, right?

2276
02:47:01,828 --> 02:47:05,275
MATT: And the Death Knight. He's going to go
directly after you. You guys going on the same

2277
02:47:05,275 --> 02:47:06,547
turn, I gave you a little bit.

2278
02:47:06,547 --> 02:47:09,728
TALIESIN: Oh man, I am not-- This does not feel
good.

2279
02:47:09,728 --> 02:47:11,352
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! Oh!

2280
02:47:11,352 --> 02:47:13,504
MATT: You watch as the bodies on the ground quiver
(sound of bones cracking)

2281
02:47:13,504 --> 02:47:15,214
And begin to rise up around you.

2282
02:47:15,214 --> 02:47:21,562
SAM: No, forget them! Fix us! Forget them, they're
nothing. Fix us.

2283
02:47:21,562 --> 02:47:23,220
LAURA: They could just attack us until we die.

2284
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:24,876
SAM: Fix. Us. They're tiny.

2285
02:47:24,876 --> 02:47:27,813
TALIESIN: I have a plan. I have a plan.

2286
02:47:27,813 --> 02:47:29,108
SAM: Fix us.

2287
02:47:29,108 --> 02:47:31,573
TRAVIS: What, you're going to pledge your fealty
to the fucking--

2288
02:47:31,573 --> 02:47:35,010
SAM: Some sort of-- I don't know, can you
restore... Restoration?

2289
02:47:35,010 --> 02:47:36,634
LAURA: Do you have mass Restoration?

2290
02:47:36,634 --> 02:47:37,974
ASHLEY: No!

2291
02:47:37,974 --> 02:47:40,202
MARISHA: That's not a spell, you guys!

2292
02:47:40,202 --> 02:47:41,463
ASHLEY: I'm useless!

2293
02:47:41,463 --> 02:47:43,908
MARISHA: I don't know if Pike can fix this!

2294
02:47:43,908 --> 02:47:46,321
LAURA: I don't think she can fix it.

2295
02:47:46,321 --> 02:47:50,665
ASHLEY: Let's use it! Let's just make it, Matt,
you can put that in your new campaign book.

2296
02:47:50,665 --> 02:47:52,324
Mass Restoration.

2297
02:47:52,324 --> 02:47:55,142
LAURA: Mass Anti-hold.

2298
02:47:55,142 --> 02:48:01,126
MATT: And this will be there. So they all rise up
out of the ground, these basic skeletons, and they

2299
02:48:01,126 --> 02:48:09,587
all get one attack. So against Percy, this one
moves in. Rolls a natural one, misses entirely.

2300
02:48:09,587 --> 02:48:15,667
One of them's going to strike at the beholder
that's up in the air; that's going to be a 15,

2301
02:48:15,667 --> 02:48:16,917
what's your armor class?

2302
02:48:16,917 --> 02:48:17,858
SAM: 18.

2303
02:48:17,858 --> 02:48:23,593
MATT: 18. Just ricochets off the armor. There's
one here that's going to go toward Pike. And

2304
02:48:23,593 --> 02:48:28,753
you're not held, right? You resisted it. So it's
going to go ahead and make a strike on you; that's

2305
02:48:28,753 --> 02:48:36,327
another 15. Just hits your armor and scrapes off,
no effect. This one's going to rush forward, two

2306
02:48:36,327 --> 02:48:45,155
against Vax on the ground. It has advantage.
That's a 19.

2307
02:48:45,155 --> 02:48:46,442
LIAM: To do what?

2308
02:48:46,442 --> 02:48:47,760
MATT: To attack you.

2309
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:50,643
LIAM: All right, so I'm at disadvantage, but I
have advantage, so it would be one straight roll?

2310
02:48:50,643 --> 02:48:54,261
MATT: No, it has advantage against you because
you're paralyzed, so yeah, it would be one

2311
02:48:54,261 --> 02:48:56,070
straight roll. The first roll was 19.

2312
02:48:56,070 --> 02:48:57,354
LIAM: Oh, so no.

2313
02:48:57,354 --> 02:49:00,706
MATT: No. Your armor class is 21 naturally?

2314
02:49:00,706 --> 02:49:07,108
LIAM: It is 21 when the daggers are out, and my
daggers are in my hands. I mean, I don't know,

2315
02:49:07,108 --> 02:49:10,241
this is kinda loosey-goosey. All right, then I'm
at 20.

2316
02:49:10,241 --> 02:49:17,795
MATT: Yeah, so it still misses you. The other one,
no, misses. Both of them just miss you. The effect

2317
02:49:17,795 --> 02:49:21,920
of the 9th-level spell is just enough of a
vibration that the attacks are being-- You're

2318
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:24,539
moving just, (grunts) ever so faintly out of the
way.

2319
02:49:24,539 --> 02:49:25,783
LIAM: Familiar.

2320
02:49:25,783 --> 02:49:28,742
MATT: One attacking Keyleth. That is a 24.

2321
02:49:28,742 --> 02:49:29,957
MARISHA: Yeah.

2322
02:49:29,957 --> 02:49:42,085
MATT: So you suffer eight points of slashing
damage. And then Vex, that is a 12 to hit? And a

2323
02:49:42,085 --> 02:49:46,874
20 to hit. Neither hit? So as they're striking
you, they're hitting the armor, it's just not

2324
02:49:46,874 --> 02:49:49,881
cutting through. They can't seem to get through
it. So that worked out okay in your favor.

2325
02:49:49,881 --> 02:49:52,569
LAURA: Thanks, dragon armor!

2326
02:49:52,569 --> 02:49:55,048
MATT: Grog? You're paralyzed.

2327
02:49:55,048 --> 02:49:56,449
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2328
02:49:56,449 --> 02:49:59,835
MATT: I believe you make another saving throw at
the end of your turn to try

2329
02:49:59,835 --> 02:50:02,427
and shrug off the effect.

2330
02:50:02,427 --> 02:50:05,066
TRAVIS: Can I go into a paralyzed rage?

2331
02:50:05,066 --> 02:50:08,418
MATT: Nope. But make a wisdom saving throw.

2332
02:50:08,418 --> 02:50:12,271
LAURA: God, we've got to roll like a 27 in order
to break it!

2333
02:50:12,271 --> 02:50:15,223
TRAVIS: 12.

2334
02:50:15,223 --> 02:50:17,395
MATT: Nope. You're still locked in place, unable
to move.

2335
02:50:17,395 --> 02:50:20,350
SAM: I will never be able to break it.

2336
02:50:20,350 --> 02:50:22,908
LAURA: A 20 didn't break it, so yeah.

2337
02:50:22,908 --> 02:50:24,339
SAM: Yeah, there's no way.

2338
02:50:24,339 --> 02:50:26,090
MATT: A natural 20 would break it.

2339
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:27,333
LAURA: A natural 20.

2340
02:50:27,333 --> 02:50:29,429
MARISHA: A natural 20 would break it, that's the
only thing?

2341
02:50:29,429 --> 02:50:33,217
TRAVIS: I have a modifier of zero, so.

2342
02:50:33,217 --> 02:50:34,591
LAURA: Yeah.

2343
02:50:34,591 --> 02:50:36,570
LIAM: Gotta fucking attack that bitch.

2344
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:39,497
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

2345
02:50:39,497 --> 02:50:42,426
MATT: Actually, you know what? No. He's gonna stay
back there and move

2346
02:50:42,426 --> 02:50:43,951
this way to get out of the way.

2347
02:50:43,951 --> 02:50:45,616
LIAM: Fuck you, Sylas.

2348
02:50:45,616 --> 02:50:52,404
MATT: As the Death Knight kinda steps over to the
side, you watch as this small sphere of darkness

2349
02:50:52,404 --> 02:51:01,204
begins to (crackling sound) into his hand, and
then throws it with an arc, in a 20-foot radius

2350
02:51:01,204 --> 02:51:04,828
centered on a point that it chooses.

2351
02:51:04,828 --> 02:51:11,997
SAM: That's rough stuff.

2352
02:51:11,997 --> 02:51:16,919
TRAVIS: You're a beholder, do you get legendary
actions and resistances and shit?

2353
02:51:16,919 --> 02:51:18,148
SAM: I don't think-- I don't know.

2354
02:51:18,148 --> 02:51:20,142
MATT: It's legendary resistances, not actions.

2355
02:51:20,142 --> 02:51:21,926
SAM: What's a legendary resistance?

2356
02:51:21,926 --> 02:51:24,003
MATT: You get to reroll-- Unless it doesn't have
it.

2357
02:51:24,003 --> 02:51:25,946
SAM: This doesn't.

2358
02:51:25,946 --> 02:51:33,346
MATT: No, the beholder does not. It's not that
powerful. All right, I need Pike, Grog--it's a

2359
02:51:33,346 --> 02:51:36,968
dexterity saving throw. So Grog and Scanlan
automatically fail. Percival and Pike, I need you

2360
02:51:36,968 --> 02:51:38,847
both to make dexterity saving throws, please.

2361
02:51:38,847 --> 02:51:43,550
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, fuck.

2362
02:51:43,550 --> 02:51:47,949
TALIESIN: Yeah. 20.

2363
02:51:47,949 --> 02:51:50,330
ASHLEY: (brightly) Six!

2364
02:51:50,330 --> 02:51:53,398
LAURA: Wait! Oh, I thought that was ten.

2365
02:51:53,398 --> 02:51:55,759
TALIESIN: I have advantage also, against--

2366
02:51:55,759 --> 02:52:02,925
MATT: Right. You take a total of 35 points of fire
and necrotic damage. You take 35 points of

2367
02:52:02,925 --> 02:52:07,204
necrotic damage, and because you're resistant to
fire, you only take

2368
02:52:07,204 --> 02:52:14,668
17 points of fire damage. 35 points.

2369
02:52:14,668 --> 02:52:20,476
ASHLEY: Did you say 17, Matt?

2370
02:52:20,476 --> 02:52:22,241
MATT: 17, yes.

2371
02:52:22,241 --> 02:52:28,706
MATT: Scanlan? And Grog. You both take-- Actually
no, since you have resistance to fire-- Which

2372
02:52:28,706 --> 02:52:31,334
actually, your form is, I should give you the
large form.

2373
02:52:31,334 --> 02:52:34,732
SAM: I added wrong. Wait, wait! Stop everything.

2374
02:52:34,732 --> 02:52:37,015
MATT: Yes? What're you stoppin'?

2375
02:52:37,015 --> 02:52:43,602
SAM: I added wrong. My saving throw was a 23.

2376
02:52:43,602 --> 02:52:45,470
MATT: Was a 23?

2377
02:52:45,470 --> 02:52:46,867
LAURA: On being held?

2378
02:52:46,867 --> 02:52:49,236
MATT: On being held? Still fails.

2379
02:52:49,236 --> 02:52:50,637
SAM: Oh!

2380
02:52:50,637 --> 02:52:53,583
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did a 24, right?

2381
02:52:53,583 --> 02:52:55,098
MARISHA: I rolled like a 27.

2382
02:52:55,098 --> 02:52:56,271
LAURA: She rolled a 27.

2383
02:52:56,271 --> 02:53:01,408
TRAVIS: 27, yeah. We gotta go!

2384
02:53:01,408 --> 02:53:04,231
LAURA: There's nowhere-- We're gonna die.

2385
02:53:04,231 --> 02:53:07,565
SAM: So what did I just get hit with? 70 points or
something?

2386
02:53:07,565 --> 02:53:09,754
MATT: You took 70 points of fire and necrotic
damage.

2387
02:53:09,754 --> 02:53:10,977
SAM: Awesome.

2388
02:53:10,977 --> 02:53:12,818
TALIESIN: Do you have resistance to any of that?

2389
02:53:12,818 --> 02:53:17,469
MATT: Not as a beholder, no. Okay, that ends the
Death Knight's turn.

2390
02:53:17,469 --> 02:53:19,501
TRAVIS: I mean, he's just dunking on us.

2391
02:53:19,501 --> 02:53:22,779
TALIESIN: Well, they're top-loading. They're
top-loading.

2392
02:53:22,779 --> 02:53:25,738
MATT: Vex. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

2393
02:53:25,738 --> 02:53:28,739
TRAVIS: Crotch in face.

2394
02:53:28,739 --> 02:53:33,020
MATT: That's cocked, roll again.

2395
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:38,161
LAURA: 21.

2396
02:53:38,161 --> 02:53:40,431
MATT: Nope, still locked in place.

2397
02:53:40,431 --> 02:53:42,208
TRAVIS: Oh, for the wisdom save?

2398
02:53:42,208 --> 02:53:43,597
MATT: Pike.

2399
02:53:43,597 --> 02:53:58,078
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog
and cast Lesser Restoration.

2400
02:53:58,078 --> 02:53:59,794
MATT: Okay, which cures...?

2401
02:53:59,794 --> 02:54:01,368
ASHLEY: Paralysis.

2402
02:54:01,368 --> 02:54:02,727
MATT: Then, yeah.

2403
02:54:02,727 --> 02:54:06,633
ASHLEY: Okay. So I've just got to run around.

2404
02:54:06,633 --> 02:54:08,417
MATT: Grog, you are cured of paralysis.

2405
02:54:08,417 --> 02:54:09,638
TRAVIS: Okay.

2406
02:54:09,638 --> 02:54:11,318
SAM: Do that a lot.

2407
02:54:11,318 --> 02:54:19,636
MATT: You feel your form freed of the effect of
the spell. Do you want to move?

2408
02:54:19,636 --> 02:54:21,625
ASHLEY: How many undead are there?

2409
02:54:21,625 --> 02:54:25,864
MATT: There are one, two, three, four, five over
there.

2410
02:54:25,864 --> 02:54:27,083
ASHLEY: Okay.

2411
02:54:27,083 --> 02:54:28,993
MATT: You already used your action to cast a
spell, so.

2412
02:54:28,993 --> 02:54:34,521
ASHLEY: Yeah. So, as my bonus action, I'm going to
cast Shield of Faith on Percy.

2413
02:54:34,521 --> 02:54:36,028
MATT: Okay.

2414
02:54:36,028 --> 02:54:41,936
ASHLEY: Which will just add two to your AC.

2415
02:54:41,936 --> 02:54:43,412
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you!

2416
02:54:43,412 --> 02:54:45,081
MATT: What level is Shield of Faith?

2417
02:54:45,081 --> 02:54:47,153
ASHLEY: First level.

2418
02:54:47,153 --> 02:54:49,699
MATT: Okay, yeah. So there you go. Just mark that
for yourself.

2419
02:54:49,699 --> 02:54:51,096
TALIESIN: Oh, it's on!

2420
02:54:51,096 --> 02:54:53,085
MATT: All righty. Do you want to move, or are you
going to stay where you are, Pike?

2421
02:54:53,085 --> 02:54:59,599
TALIESIN: You've got a Death Knight, if you're
feeling frisky.

2422
02:54:59,599 --> 02:55:01,711
TRAVIS: Do you want to move or stay where you
are?

2423
02:55:01,711 --> 02:55:10,403
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry. I'm going to hide behind the
beholder.

2424
02:55:10,403 --> 02:55:19,701
MATT: Okay, so you move around Grog and get right
about there. That ends your turn, Pike. Vax, make

2425
02:55:19,701 --> 02:55:21,078
a wisdom saving throw.

2426
02:55:21,078 --> 02:55:22,790
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to roll a natural 20.

2427
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:24,131
MARISHA: You have advantage on everything.

2428
02:55:24,131 --> 02:55:25,135
LIAM: I know.

2429
02:55:25,135 --> 02:55:26,434
MARISHA: That's good. That's okay.

2430
02:55:26,434 --> 02:55:29,777
LIAM: It's not a natural 20, though, which is what
it's going to take. I'm going to use Luck.

2431
02:55:29,777 --> 02:55:31,350
MARISHA: Oh my god, you rolled a 19.

2432
02:55:31,350 --> 02:55:32,843
LIAM: 18 and a 19.

2433
02:55:32,843 --> 02:55:34,317
SAM: Plus anything?

2434
02:55:34,317 --> 02:55:40,515
LIAM: Plus two. Gets me to 21. I need a natural 20.
Luck. No. Okay.

2435
02:55:40,515 --> 02:55:44,771
MATT: That ends your turn, Vax. Percival.

2436
02:55:44,771 --> 02:55:51,096
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot against the wall
towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of

2437
02:55:51,096 --> 02:55:56,850
movement will take me because I don't like
clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in

2438
02:55:56,850 --> 02:56:10,041
the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm
going to take Bad News out, and just to keep

2439
02:56:10,041 --> 02:56:20,390
everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point
for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter

2440
02:56:20,390 --> 02:56:21,811
shot on him.

2441
02:56:21,811 --> 02:56:24,089
MATT: Okay, so minus five to the attack roll.

2442
02:56:24,089 --> 02:56:32,951
TALIESIN: Minus five to the attack. That's a crit!
That's a crit.

2443
02:56:32,951 --> 02:56:35,674
MATT: You rolled a 19, yeah, which you have now at
level 18.

2444
02:56:35,674 --> 02:56:37,248
TALIESIN: At level 18, that's a crit.

2445
02:56:37,248 --> 02:56:42,852
MATT: This is with which gun?

2446
02:56:42,852 --> 02:56:51,335
TALIESIN: This is with Bad News, so that's going
to be 2d12. That's going to be 4d12 plus six.

2447
02:56:51,335 --> 02:56:53,378
MATT: This is Bad News, you said?

2448
02:56:53,378 --> 02:56:58,138
TALIESIN: Bad News. I don't know if this also
doubles-- I don't think it does-- but I'm pouring

2449
02:56:58,138 --> 02:57:00,403
all of Cabal's Ruin into this shit, too.

2450
02:57:00,403 --> 02:57:07,014
MATT: Go ahead and roll the Cabal's Ruin damage.
The actual hit from Bad News does nothing.

2451
02:57:07,014 --> 02:57:08,477
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

2452
02:57:08,477 --> 02:57:18,341
MATT: The non-enchanted attack from Bad News hits
and dissipates across his form. It's not half

2453
02:57:18,341 --> 02:57:23,897
damage. Nothing. This is Vecna. Cabal's Ruin is
considered magical damage,

2454
02:57:23,897 --> 02:57:25,470
so that will go through.

2455
02:57:25,470 --> 02:57:29,931
MARISHA: Was that the one you critted on?

2456
02:57:29,931 --> 02:57:32,304
TALIESIN: Yeah, I burned a crit.

2457
02:57:32,304 --> 02:57:36,977
MATT: You gained the grit back, though.

2458
02:57:36,977 --> 02:57:43,171
TALIESIN: The grit's not burned, so that's nice.
These don't double, do they?

2459
02:57:43,171 --> 02:57:48,567
MATT: No. Wait, technically, they would.
Technically, they do, because it is a crit. All

2460
02:57:48,567 --> 02:57:49,951
dice double, yeah.

2461
02:57:49,951 --> 02:57:51,510
ASHLEY: Get him!

2462
02:57:51,510 --> 02:57:59,397
TALIESIN: Does my other rule also apply to this?
Does this add to bleed damage now? Maybe not.

2463
02:57:59,397 --> 02:58:01,811
MATT: I don't think so, because it's an outside
effect.

2464
02:58:01,811 --> 02:58:05,512
TALIESIN: It's an outside factor. That's fine. I'm
with you.

2465
02:58:05,512 --> 02:58:10,742
MATT: No, you know what? It would because just
like any other critical effect, yes, it would.

2466
02:58:10,742 --> 02:58:12,022
TALIESIN: Okay.

2467
02:58:12,022 --> 02:58:13,355
MATT: It would.

2468
02:58:13,355 --> 02:58:18,447
TALIESIN: (counting) 32. That's 32.

2469
02:58:18,447 --> 02:58:34,244
MARISHA: Did you count that one?

2470
02:58:34,244 --> 02:58:38,686
TALIESIN: 36 points of damage, times two.

2471
02:58:38,686 --> 02:58:41,410
LAURA: 72.

2472
02:58:41,410 --> 02:58:42,852
MATT: 72.

2473
02:58:42,852 --> 02:58:50,956
TALIESIN: 72 points of electrical damage, and then
he's also going to get a bleed of 31. No, he's

2474
02:58:50,956 --> 02:58:52,797
going to get a bleed of 15.

2475
02:58:52,797 --> 02:58:57,948
MATT: He will get 15 because he's resistant to
lightning, so he takes half of that next time.

2476
02:58:57,948 --> 02:59:03,873
TALIESIN: But he still has to roll concentration.

2477
02:59:03,873 --> 02:59:05,465
MATT: Yeah, for 36.

2478
02:59:05,465 --> 02:59:14,401
TALIESIN: I'll take it, and goodbye, Cabal. I'll
gain more when he hits me with some magic shit.

2479
02:59:14,401 --> 02:59:18,701
SAM: Oh boy.

2480
02:59:18,701 --> 02:59:25,490
LAURA: It's such an anti-climactic fight because
none of us can do anything.

2481
02:59:25,490 --> 02:59:39,086
MATT: That would be 18 as half that. DC is 18 to
maintain concentration. Yeah, he saves.

2482
02:59:39,086 --> 02:59:40,701
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it!

2483
02:59:40,701 --> 02:59:42,129
MATT: Barely. By one.

2484
02:59:42,129 --> 02:59:43,348
TRAVIS: By one?

2485
02:59:43,348 --> 02:59:44,665
MATT: By one.

2486
02:59:44,665 --> 02:59:45,931
LAURA: On concentration?

2487
02:59:45,931 --> 02:59:49,502
TALIESIN: Damn it. I was debating whether or not
to hit him with Hex, and now I'm so sad I didn't.

2488
02:59:49,502 --> 03:00:07,044
Oh, well. That's okay. I'm reloading, and I'm
going to take another Bad News shot at Delilah.

2489
03:00:07,044 --> 03:00:09,103
Where is she?

2490
03:00:09,103 --> 03:00:10,194
MATT: She's over here.

2491
03:00:10,194 --> 03:00:11,598
TALIESIN: What is she doing?

2492
03:00:11,598 --> 03:00:15,670
MATT: She just stepped over Vax's paralyzed body
and threw a Finger of Death at Vex.

2493
03:00:15,670 --> 03:00:26,631
TALIESIN: Okay. Let's burn that little bit of
Animus again and burn that grit point again for

2494
03:00:26,631 --> 03:00:41,515
advantage. Let's hit her with Bad News. Actually,
I'll cast... Hex on her, as well, just for fun.

2495
03:00:41,515 --> 03:00:43,213
MATT: Okay.

2496
03:00:43,213 --> 03:00:51,339
TALIESIN: And give her constitution disadvantage.
Actually, let's give her, just in case she gets

2497
03:00:51,339 --> 03:00:54,505
grappled-- let's make it constitution
disadvantage. Fuck it.

2498
03:00:54,505 --> 03:00:55,623
MATT: Okay.

2499
03:00:55,623 --> 03:01:04,306
TALIESIN: And then I've got bonus, and I'm doing
sharpshooter again. Thank god I did because that

2500
03:01:04,306 --> 03:01:09,439
was a terrible shot. That's 14.

2501
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:12,236
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you go to
fire--

2502
03:01:12,236 --> 03:01:14,840
ASHLEY: Do we know what would hit?

2503
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:17,640
TALIESIN: We don't.

2504
03:01:17,640 --> 03:01:22,562
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing to add ten?

2505
03:01:22,562 --> 03:01:23,736
MATT: Gives a plus ten?

2506
03:01:23,736 --> 03:01:25,764
TALIESIN: Oh, that would definitely hit, I'd
imagine.

2507
03:01:25,764 --> 03:01:30,065
MATT: You use War God's Blessing as a reaction
onto Percy. As you go to fire, you feel the

2508
03:01:30,065 --> 03:01:33,985
presence of Sarenrae coalesce around the blade,
and you hear a little whisper over your shoulder

2509
03:01:33,985 --> 03:01:39,833
say, "There." And all of a sudden, clarity comes
into frame and (gunshot) you fire Bad News towards

2510
03:01:39,833 --> 03:01:44,725
Delilah. Go ahead and roll damage on that. She's
not even going to spend a Shield on that.

2511
03:01:44,725 --> 03:01:46,653
It's way over her AC.

2512
03:01:46,653 --> 03:02:01,926
TALIESIN: Not bad. That's (counting) 20 points of
piercing damage and

2513
03:02:01,926 --> 03:02:04,434
five points of necrotic damage.

2514
03:02:04,434 --> 03:02:11,331
MATT: (gunshot) It blasts, and you see the robe
tear open on one side.

2515
03:02:11,331 --> 03:02:15,093
She's like (cries out, breathes heavily).

2516
03:02:15,093 --> 03:02:18,079
TALIESIN: That's my roll.

2517
03:02:18,079 --> 03:02:24,696
MATT: You glance over with the scope and see as
she turns and looks at you. You can see, what you

2518
03:02:24,696 --> 03:02:31,395
didn't see earlier, is one normal eye she has and
one yellowish-green eye with a cat-slit pupil.

2519
03:02:31,395 --> 03:02:33,336
TALIESIN: Shit.

2520
03:02:33,336 --> 03:02:35,589
LAURA: What does that even mean?

2521
03:02:35,589 --> 03:02:40,859
TALIESIN: Vecna's been busy. Okay. This is going
to get interesting.

2522
03:02:40,859 --> 03:02:42,698
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.

2523
03:02:42,698 --> 03:02:44,524
TALIESIN: That's all I can do.

2524
03:02:44,524 --> 03:02:46,719
MATT: Scanlan, go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

2525
03:02:46,719 --> 03:02:47,641
SAM: Nope.

2526
03:02:47,641 --> 03:02:49,105
MATT: Okay.

2527
03:02:49,105 --> 03:02:53,433
SAM: I can't move my eyes or anything or turn on
my anti-magic?

2528
03:02:53,433 --> 03:03:03,805
MATT: As far as the ray that you have, the eye
perspective, you're hitting right there, so you're

2529
03:03:03,805 --> 03:03:16,751
just out of range to get rid of the paralysis from
Vex and off Vax. If you manage to break from this

2530
03:03:16,751 --> 03:03:20,461
somehow and you rotate, the spell would have no
effect while it's on them.

2531
03:03:20,461 --> 03:03:27,367
MARISHA: They're broken from it by being in his
gaze? Am I in his gaze?

2532
03:03:27,367 --> 03:03:29,277
MATT: No, you are not.

2533
03:03:29,277 --> 03:03:34,857
MARISHA: So I can still cast spells. But if I move
into his gaze, I cannot.

2534
03:03:34,857 --> 03:03:38,697
MATT: Correct. Or if you shoot something through
the cone, it will dissipate.

2535
03:03:38,697 --> 03:03:41,416
MARISHA: If I shoot up at Vecna, will it go
through the cone?

2536
03:03:41,416 --> 03:03:44,848
MATT: Yeah, probably. You're just outside of it.

2537
03:03:44,848 --> 03:03:46,760
MARISHA: I will not go through the cone?

2538
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:52,671
MATT: Probably. You can angle it that way, yeah.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

2539
03:03:52,671 --> 03:03:54,301
MARISHA: It is now my turn.

2540
03:03:54,301 --> 03:03:58,458
MATT: Also, I need you to make a concentration
check.

2541
03:03:58,458 --> 03:04:01,299
SAM: Oh, my spell.

2542
03:04:01,299 --> 03:04:02,834
MATT: Yeah, transformation.

2543
03:04:02,834 --> 03:04:06,359
SAM: I get advantage as a gnome.

2544
03:04:06,359 --> 03:04:11,857
MATT: You do. How much damage did you take on that
one, total, from the blast? From the blast that

2545
03:04:11,857 --> 03:04:14,226
you took on that.

2546
03:04:14,226 --> 03:04:15,411
SAM: 70 points.

2547
03:04:15,411 --> 03:04:17,736
MATT: You have to beat a 35.

2548
03:04:17,736 --> 03:04:20,585
SAM: Okay. As a wisdom?

2549
03:04:20,585 --> 03:04:24,131
MATT: That would have been concentration.
Constitution saving throw.

2550
03:04:24,131 --> 03:04:26,000
SAM: Constitution saving throw.

2551
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:33,254
MATT: In theory, Scanlan, before it came to your
turn, you dropped your beholder form.

2552
03:04:33,254 --> 03:04:35,790
SAM: Oh! I'm no longer paralyzed.

2553
03:04:35,790 --> 03:04:38,951
MATT: The spell maintains itself.

2554
03:04:38,951 --> 03:04:41,260
SAM: No! But I'm a different guy!

2555
03:04:41,260 --> 03:04:43,776
MATT: It's your mind it affects.

2556
03:04:43,776 --> 03:04:45,601
MARISHA: Why?

2557
03:04:45,601 --> 03:04:50,772
MATT: Any spell still carries over the effects on
you. You can't wild shape and--

2558
03:04:50,772 --> 03:04:52,452
MARISHA: He lost concentration?

2559
03:04:52,452 --> 03:04:54,529
MATT: He lost concentration on his big spell,
yeah.

2560
03:04:54,529 --> 03:04:57,919
SAM: Hey, guys.

2561
03:04:57,919 --> 03:04:59,515
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan!

2562
03:04:59,515 --> 03:05:04,418
MATT: I'll let you remake that saving throw with
your constitution. Sorry, your wisdom. With

2563
03:05:04,418 --> 03:05:05,984
Scanlan's wisdom.

2564
03:05:05,984 --> 03:05:09,962
SAM: Okay, do I get advantage because of magic?

2565
03:05:09,962 --> 03:05:13,846
MATT: Yes, because it is magic.

2566
03:05:13,846 --> 03:05:17,065
SAM: And can I inspire myself?

2567
03:05:17,065 --> 03:05:18,172
MATT: Yes, you can.

2568
03:05:18,172 --> 03:05:25,273
SAM: All right. I will inspire myself. 24.

2569
03:05:25,273 --> 03:05:26,702
MATT: 24 is just enough.

2570
03:05:26,702 --> 03:05:30,982
(relieved laughter)

2571
03:05:30,982 --> 03:05:34,613
MATT: You shrug off the paralysis at the end of
your turn. You're now free to move.

2572
03:05:34,613 --> 03:05:37,906
SAM: Just move. I can't act, right?

2573
03:05:37,906 --> 03:05:42,285
MATT: No, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth,
what are you doing?

2574
03:05:42,285 --> 03:05:45,152
MARISHA: Is he 60 feet away from me? Is he within
range?

2575
03:05:45,152 --> 03:05:47,028
MATT: Who?

2576
03:05:47,028 --> 03:05:49,349
MARISHA: Should I handle Delilah, or should I
handle him?

2577
03:05:49,349 --> 03:05:53,594
TRAVIS: What're you doing? Which one do you want?

2578
03:05:53,594 --> 03:05:56,062
SAM: I can move now, or just in general?

2579
03:05:56,062 --> 03:05:57,932
MATT: No, next turn you'll be able to move.

2580
03:05:57,932 --> 03:06:00,711
MARISHA: Is he within 60 feet of me? Vecna.

2581
03:06:00,711 --> 03:06:03,283
MATT: You're not sure. You'd have to eyeball it.

2582
03:06:03,283 --> 03:06:13,558
MARISHA: (counting) He's exactly 60 feet in the
air. I have to get directly under his butthole.

2583
03:06:13,558 --> 03:06:15,373
Can I get directly under his butthole?

2584
03:06:15,373 --> 03:06:19,000
MATT: You can move through Trinket. You'll get two
attacks of opportunity from two skeletons.

2585
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:22,882
MARISHA: Jesus, balls.

2586
03:06:22,882 --> 03:06:24,533
LIAM: Jesus balls.

2587
03:06:24,533 --> 03:06:27,252
MATT: You'd have to leapfrog over Trinket to get
there, but you can do it.

2588
03:06:27,252 --> 03:06:32,827
MARISHA: What about Delilah. Where is she?

2589
03:06:32,827 --> 03:06:36,258
MATT: Delilah's over here. She and two skeletons
right now are lording over

2590
03:06:36,258 --> 03:06:38,345
the paralyzed Vax on the ground.

2591
03:06:38,345 --> 03:06:46,572
MARISHA: If I move at all, I'm going to take
opportunity from skeletons.

2592
03:06:46,572 --> 03:06:50,145
MATT: Yep. They don't do a whole lot of damage,
but damage adds up.

2593
03:06:50,145 --> 03:07:03,878
MARISHA: Jesus. Okay, I am going to head to
Delilah. I can move up to her, correct?

2594
03:07:03,878 --> 03:07:06,628
MATT: You're going to move straight up to her?

2595
03:07:06,628 --> 03:07:07,761
MARISHA: Can I?

2596
03:07:07,761 --> 03:07:17,231
MATT: You can, yeah. Both skeletons get attacks of
opportunity on you. That's a nine and a 12. They

2597
03:07:17,231 --> 03:07:24,383
both hit you, but the mantle writhes out in front
of you. You watch as various leaves unfurl almost

2598
03:07:24,383 --> 03:07:27,606
like a cat's fur on the back of its neck, and it
deflects the blows

2599
03:07:27,606 --> 03:07:29,832
from the skeletons as you rush past.

2600
03:07:29,832 --> 03:07:39,860
MARISHA: I can give her disadvantage on
constitution checks, and whenever she takes

2601
03:07:39,860 --> 03:07:42,451
damage, she's stunned, or should I do the
confusion thing?

2602
03:07:42,451 --> 03:07:46,533
TALIESIN: Either one. They're both good. Go for
the first one. Pick one.

2603
03:07:46,533 --> 03:07:52,750
MARISHA: I'm turning into Ashley Johnson. Okay.

2604
03:07:52,750 --> 03:07:54,039
ASHLEY: Okay!

2605
03:07:54,039 --> 03:08:12,656
MARISHA: I'm going to go up to Delilah. (pants)
Cotton mouth. Oh boy. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go

2606
03:08:12,656 --> 03:08:20,063
up to her and be like, experience what you've been
putting all of us through. And I'm going to touch

2607
03:08:20,063 --> 03:08:25,385
her and I'm going to try and cast Contagion on her
with Mind Fire?

2608
03:08:25,385 --> 03:08:28,017
MATT: Okay.

2609
03:08:28,017 --> 03:08:29,671
LAURA: Mind Fire!

2610
03:08:29,671 --> 03:08:33,143
LIAM: Sounds good.

2611
03:08:33,143 --> 03:08:35,999
TALIESIN: Hit her with a mind bullet.

2612
03:08:35,999 --> 03:08:38,500
TRAVIS: Mind bullets!

2613
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:40,971
TALIESIN and MARISHA: That's telekinesis, Kyle!

2614
03:08:40,971 --> 03:08:44,187
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (singing) How about
the power to move you?

2615
03:08:44,187 --> 03:08:46,781
MATT: Make a melee spell attack.

2616
03:08:46,781 --> 03:08:50,370
MARISHA: I have a bonus to my spell attacks.

2617
03:08:50,370 --> 03:08:55,503
LAURA: You've got this!

2618
03:08:55,503 --> 03:09:08,398
MARISHA: It's cocked. That's even worse. Not
great. 18?

2619
03:09:08,398 --> 03:09:12,065
MATT: 18 is exactly what you needed. That's her
armor class.

2620
03:09:12,065 --> 03:09:15,499
LIAM: (singing) We'll fucking lead as two kings!

2621
03:09:15,499 --> 03:09:19,665
TRAVIS: (laughing) Tenacious D for the rest
of this fight, please.

2622
03:09:19,665 --> 03:09:22,211
MATT: She now is affected by Mind Fire.

2623
03:09:22,211 --> 03:09:26,116
MARISHA: Her mind becomes feverish, and she has
disadvantage on intelligence checks and

2624
03:09:26,116 --> 03:09:29,330
intelligence saving throws, and she becomes
confused.

2625
03:09:29,330 --> 03:09:32,337
SAM: What does that mean? What does confused
mean?

2626
03:09:32,337 --> 03:09:33,872
MARISHA: For seven days.

2627
03:09:33,872 --> 03:09:36,002
LIAM: It sounds like she can't cast spells too
well.

2628
03:09:36,002 --> 03:09:37,444
MARISHA: Hopefully.

2629
03:09:37,444 --> 03:09:44,483
MATT: She's now considered confused. She's under
the effects of the Confusion spell

2630
03:09:44,483 --> 03:09:46,072
for as long as it lasts.

2631
03:09:46,072 --> 03:09:48,607
TALIESIN: That's me under the effects of being
confused about the Confusion spell.

2632
03:09:48,607 --> 03:09:50,463
MATT: Does that end your turn, Keyleth?

2633
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:53,838
TALIESIN: What do you have for a bonus?

2634
03:09:53,838 --> 03:10:01,111
MARISHA: I don't have a lot for a bonus. I can go
into an elemental form.

2635
03:10:01,111 --> 03:10:05,476
TRAVIS: If we attack her, is that going to drop
the confusion?

2636
03:10:05,476 --> 03:10:07,229
TALIESIN: Yeah, can we attack her?

2637
03:10:07,229 --> 03:10:10,212
MARISHA: No, it just lasts for seven days.

2638
03:10:10,212 --> 03:10:14,272
MATT: It lasts for seven days if she fails the
saves. She has three saves in a row, and if she

2639
03:10:14,272 --> 03:10:17,167
succeeds, it goes away. If she fails, it lasts for
seven days.

2640
03:10:17,167 --> 03:10:26,773
MARISHA: Okay. She has to make constitution saving
throws. But she's under the effects right now,

2641
03:10:26,773 --> 03:10:31,337
correct? We've been through this before, haven't
we?

2642
03:10:31,337 --> 03:10:35,157
LAURA: Oh, yeah. This is one of the ones we tried
a long time ago.

2643
03:10:35,157 --> 03:10:41,437
MARISHA: It says after failing three of these
saving throws, the disease effects last for the

2644
03:10:41,437 --> 03:10:45,924
duration, so that would make me assume that she
has it at least for three rounds.

2645
03:10:45,924 --> 03:10:53,151
MATT: We had this discussion before, because in
the ability, it has Slimy Doom, which whenever it

2646
03:10:53,151 --> 03:10:56,237
takes damage, it becomes stunned, which is the
most broken--

2647
03:10:56,237 --> 03:10:58,007
MARISHA: I almost did that.

2648
03:10:58,007 --> 03:11:01,517
MATT: I know, but I think the DND ruling,
technically, they have to

2649
03:11:01,517 --> 03:11:03,314
fail three saves before it affects them.

2650
03:11:03,314 --> 03:11:05,701
MARISHA: But it's a 5th-level fucking spell.
That's a lot!

2651
03:11:05,701 --> 03:11:07,032
MATT: I know.

2652
03:11:07,032 --> 03:11:11,110
MARISHA: That's lame. Three rounds for a 5th-level
spell?

2653
03:11:11,110 --> 03:11:14,618
MATT: Look. I'll say this. I'll let Mind Fire work
on her for now.

2654
03:11:14,618 --> 03:11:19,440
MARISHA: Oh, he doesn't look happy. I feel like I
just pissed off the DM.

2655
03:11:19,440 --> 03:11:23,980
MATT: No, you didn't piss off the DM. This spell
has a lot of contention in the community, but the

2656
03:11:23,980 --> 03:11:27,300
official DND ruling was it doesn't affect until
they fail all three rolls, but as it's written, it

2657
03:11:27,300 --> 03:11:31,241
doesn't say that. It says they're afflicted on
being hit, so I'm letting it go through because

2658
03:11:31,241 --> 03:11:33,860
you didn't choose the cheesy-ass stun-lock broken
spell.

2659
03:11:33,860 --> 03:11:36,670
MARISHA: It does say that after succeeding on three of
these, the creature <i>recovers</i> from the disease,

2660
03:11:36,744 --> 03:11:39,753
so they were already affected.

2661
03:11:39,753 --> 03:11:45,711
MATT: Which is what I'm saying. This is between
what's written in the spell and the arguments that

2662
03:11:45,711 --> 03:11:49,559
people have made with DND on Twitter, and they
clarified that's not how it works. It's a

2663
03:11:49,559 --> 03:11:54,269
mis-type. It wasn't clear. I'm letting it work. Be
happy with the book.

2664
03:11:54,269 --> 03:11:59,675
LAURA: Stop making eye contact. Look down!

2665
03:11:59,675 --> 03:12:06,414
MATT: At the end of your turn, Vecna's going to
use some legendary actions to cast a spell.

2666
03:12:06,414 --> 03:12:08,462
(groaning)

2667
03:12:08,462 --> 03:12:10,963
TRAVIS: How about you just say he did, and 
don't?

2668
03:12:10,963 --> 03:12:13,312
ASHLEY: Yeah. Let's not and say we did.

2669
03:12:13,312 --> 03:12:16,230
LIAM: He could just evil monologue a little bit,
tell us his plan?

2670
03:12:16,230 --> 03:12:18,119
LAURA: He's really good at evil monologuing.

2671
03:12:18,119 --> 03:12:19,904
TALIESIN: We were talking about how much you
wanted a monologue.

2672
03:12:19,904 --> 03:12:21,723
I really feel like this is the moment.

2673
03:12:21,723 --> 03:12:26,506
MATT: He's going to cast a 7th-level Fireball
right there.

2674
03:12:26,506 --> 03:12:30,142
TRAVIS: 7th-level Fireball?

2675
03:12:30,142 --> 03:12:32,283
TALIESIN: That's the end of Vax.

2676
03:12:32,283 --> 03:12:34,788
TRAVIS: We've got to go.

2677
03:12:34,788 --> 03:12:40,480
MATT: I need Keyleth, Vax-- you don't auto-save,
yeah.

2678
03:12:40,480 --> 03:12:41,873
LIAM: Good night.

2679
03:12:41,873 --> 03:12:47,630
TRAVIS: Maybe the Raven Queen will use you or
something.

2680
03:12:47,630 --> 03:12:50,891
LIAM: I can't. It's an automatic fail because I'm
paralyzed.

2681
03:12:50,891 --> 03:12:52,483
MATT: Yeah.

2682
03:12:52,483 --> 03:13:00,685
SAM: That's actually good. He'll lose the
paralysis because he'll be in a coma. We'll just

2683
03:13:00,685 --> 03:13:03,428
wake you back up and you'll be fine. It's actually
kind of good.

2684
03:13:03,428 --> 03:13:06,416
MATT: Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity
saving throw, please.

2685
03:13:06,416 --> 03:13:09,292
The skeletons are obliterated.

2686
03:13:09,292 --> 03:13:14,240
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

2687
03:13:14,240 --> 03:13:18,164
TRAVIS: Are you serious?! Are you serious?

2688
03:13:18,164 --> 03:13:19,895
TALIESIN: I'm looking at it.

2689
03:13:19,895 --> 03:13:27,835
MATT: That's a surprisingly shitty roll. 38 points
of fire damage to Vax. 38.

2690
03:13:27,835 --> 03:13:30,004
TRAVIS: On a 7th-level Fireball?

2691
03:13:30,004 --> 03:13:31,539
MATT: I know. I rolled really shitty.

2692
03:13:31,539 --> 03:13:32,935
MARISHA: 38?

2693
03:13:32,935 --> 03:13:38,797
MATT: 38 to you, as well. 38 to Vex. And 38 to
Trinket.

2694
03:13:38,797 --> 03:13:47,148
TALIESIN: That's a small-- that's a dire
armadillo. That's okay.

2695
03:13:47,148 --> 03:13:53,614
LAURA: 38 to Trinket?

2696
03:13:53,614 --> 03:13:55,839
TRAVIS: Did Delilah take all that damage, too?

2697
03:13:55,839 --> 03:14:05,135
MATT: Delilah? Yeah, she did. She can't save
against his shit. She takes it and (grunts).

2698
03:14:05,135 --> 03:14:08,085
LIAM: She probably kind of likes it.

2699
03:14:08,085 --> 03:14:10,231
LAURA: She's like, ooh.

2700
03:14:10,231 --> 03:14:12,241
TALIESIN: Burn. Sick burn.

2701
03:14:12,241 --> 03:14:18,317
MATT: It made sense for the circumstance. She's up
for the sacrifice. All righty, that ends Keyleth's

2702
03:14:18,317 --> 03:14:21,381
turn. Top of the round. Now it's Vecna's go.

2703
03:14:21,381 --> 03:14:23,842
TRAVIS: I thought that <i>was</i> Vecna's go.

2704
03:14:23,842 --> 03:14:25,677
LAURA: That was his legendary.

2705
03:14:25,677 --> 03:14:28,273
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2706
03:14:28,273 --> 03:14:34,252
LAURA: I like that you have an enlarged figure
Grog. That's cool.

2707
03:14:34,252 --> 03:14:37,077
TRAVIS: I thought you were complimenting the DM. I
was like, yeah, keep it up.

2708
03:14:37,077 --> 03:14:39,652
LAURA: I like that you made an enlarged figure for
Grog.

2709
03:14:39,652 --> 03:14:42,302
SAM: I'll kill you last.

2710
03:14:42,302 --> 03:14:44,627
LAURA: Oh my god, this map is so pretty.

2711
03:14:44,627 --> 03:14:49,121
(laughter)

2712
03:14:49,121 --> 03:14:51,139
SAM: What is that thing in the middle of the
field?

2713
03:14:51,139 --> 03:14:52,367
MATT: This is the altar.

2714
03:14:52,367 --> 03:14:53,953
LAURA: Whatever it is, it's really cool.

2715
03:14:53,953 --> 03:14:55,836
ASHLEY: Can we see what's in it?

2716
03:14:55,836 --> 03:14:58,656
MATT: You'd have to go check it out, if there was
anything.

2717
03:14:58,656 --> 03:15:00,463
MARISHA: Is he moving towards the altar?

2718
03:15:00,463 --> 03:15:11,377
MATT: He's shifting in the center and looking down
for a bit. He goes, "Well, sleep."

2719
03:15:11,377 --> 03:15:16,656
TALIESIN: Can he do that with concentration?

2720
03:15:16,656 --> 03:15:20,405
MATT: This is not a concentration spell.

2721
03:15:20,405 --> 03:15:25,665
LAURA: Magic can't put me to sleep.

2722
03:15:25,665 --> 03:15:27,751
MATT: He casts Power Word Kill.

2723
03:15:27,751 --> 03:15:29,586
SAM: Oh. Well, that's different.

2724
03:15:29,586 --> 03:15:31,217
LIAM: Where did Sleep go?

2725
03:15:31,217 --> 03:15:32,480
MATT: That's just what he said.

2726
03:15:32,480 --> 03:15:34,891
SAM: He meant metaphorical. He meant death.

2727
03:15:34,891 --> 03:15:37,458
MATT: You utter a word of power that can compel
one creature you see within range to die

2728
03:15:37,458 --> 03:15:41,668
instantly. If the creature you chose has 100 hit
points or fewer, it dies.

2729
03:15:41,668 --> 03:15:43,265
How many hit points do you have?

2730
03:15:43,265 --> 03:15:45,608
LAURA: I'm dead. Insta-full death?

2731
03:15:45,608 --> 03:15:47,242
MATT: Insta-full death.

2732
03:15:47,242 --> 03:15:48,613
MARISHA: No saving from it?

2733
03:15:48,613 --> 03:15:49,744
MATT: No.

2734
03:15:49,744 --> 03:15:51,144
ASHLEY: Wait, what?

2735
03:15:51,144 --> 03:15:52,251
TALIESIN: What?

2736
03:15:52,251 --> 03:15:53,484
SAM: Perma-death?

2737
03:15:53,484 --> 03:15:56,647
MATT: No death saving throws. You watch as the
life suddenly fades from Vex's eyes,

2738
03:15:56,647 --> 03:15:58,468
and she falls to the ground.

2739
03:15:58,468 --> 03:16:05,269
LIAM: Vax is watching, frozen.

2740
03:16:05,269 --> 03:16:06,833
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2741
03:16:06,833 --> 03:16:11,328
LAURA: Hey, don't compliment the map, you guys.
Matt really doesn't like it.

2742
03:16:11,328 --> 03:16:16,953
MATT: I'm sorry. It's now Delilah's turn.

2743
03:16:16,953 --> 03:16:18,798
TALIESIN: This is not going well.

2744
03:16:18,798 --> 03:16:20,214
SAM: Maybe we should leave.

2745
03:16:20,214 --> 03:16:21,547
TRAVIS: Plane Shift?

2746
03:16:21,547 --> 03:16:27,129
MATT: She turns and looks at you, Keyleth, and
goes--

2747
03:16:27,129 --> 03:16:28,801
SAM: Is this Delilah?

2748
03:16:28,801 --> 03:16:37,025
MATT: This is Delilah. "You took him from me. Now
I'm going to take him from you." She points down.

2749
03:16:37,025 --> 03:16:39,222
SAM: I thought she was confused.

2750
03:16:39,222 --> 03:16:42,535
MATT: I have to check what she does now. This may
make the change.

2751
03:16:42,535 --> 03:16:48,264
LIAM: Well, we weren't technically dating when we
killed her, so I'm not really sure if she'd know.

2752
03:16:48,264 --> 03:16:52,447
MATT: I get to roll a d10.

2753
03:16:52,447 --> 03:16:55,557
MARISHA: Let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a
ten, y'all.

2754
03:16:55,557 --> 03:16:56,630
MATT: A ten.

2755
03:16:56,630 --> 03:16:59,855
MARISHA: You are fucking lying to me! (groans)

2756
03:16:59,855 --> 03:17:03,477
MATT: It's right there.

2757
03:17:03,477 --> 03:17:06,473
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see it.

2758
03:17:06,473 --> 03:17:09,110
TALIESIN: Oh shit. Wow, you really went down.

2759
03:17:09,110 --> 03:17:15,097
MATT: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well. I'm
sorry, guys.

2760
03:17:15,241 --> 03:17:17,688
LIAM: Yeah, but that Fireball was super low.

2761
03:17:17,688 --> 03:17:25,426
MATT: All right, so do I have to roll for an
attack on this? Creature has to make a dexterity

2762
03:17:25,426 --> 03:17:33,506
saving throw. Hold on.

2763
03:17:33,506 --> 03:17:37,845
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

2764
03:17:37,845 --> 03:17:41,869
MATT: That's 76 points of damage from the
Disintegrate spell.

2765
03:17:41,869 --> 03:17:45,261
LIAM: Halved from the Deathwalker's Ward. It's set
to necromantic.

2766
03:17:45,261 --> 03:17:49,263
MATT: It's force damage. Disintegrate's force
damage.

2767
03:17:49,263 --> 03:17:51,543
LIAM: Oh. Well, then I'm down.

2768
03:17:51,543 --> 03:17:55,160
MARISHA: No, that means he's disintegrated.

2769
03:17:55,160 --> 03:18:01,299
MATT: You watch as Vax's form (fluttering noise)
turns to dust.

2770
03:18:01,299 --> 03:18:03,213
SAM: Wait, what?

2771
03:18:03,213 --> 03:18:09,459
MATT: Leaving the armor of the Raven Queen empty
on the ground, the daggers (clattering).

2772
03:18:09,459 --> 03:18:11,189
LAURA: No body left?

2773
03:18:11,189 --> 03:18:12,960
MARISHA: There's no recovering from that, dude.

2774
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:15,061
LAURA: Bro. We're gone.

2775
03:18:15,061 --> 03:18:16,871
TALIESIN: Wow.

2776
03:18:16,871 --> 03:18:21,080
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

2777
03:18:21,080 --> 03:18:23,513
SAM: What's happening?

2778
03:18:23,513 --> 03:18:28,819
LAURA: I thought this campaign was going to last
longer than this.

2779
03:18:28,819 --> 03:18:32,949
LIAM: I said this was the last episode, and I
meant it.

2780
03:18:32,949 --> 03:18:36,850
TALIESIN: You are a terrible person. Oh no.

2781
03:18:36,850 --> 03:18:43,066
SAM: With Foresight? Oh, because you're paralyzed.
Oh fuck.

2782
03:18:43,066 --> 03:18:45,825
MARISHA: She doesn't have to roll against that?

2783
03:18:45,825 --> 03:18:49,812
MATT: It's a dexterity saving throw, but he's
still paralyzed.

2784
03:18:49,812 --> 03:18:51,754
MARISHA: He doesn't get advantage?

2785
03:18:51,754 --> 03:18:54,701
MATT: You automatically fail dex saving throws
when you're paralyzed.

2786
03:18:54,701 --> 03:18:57,672
TALIESIN: You can't dex out of something if you
can't move.

2787
03:18:57,672 --> 03:19:03,717
TRAVIS: If I throw you over to her, can you
Revivify?

2788
03:19:03,717 --> 03:19:06,927
SAM: I'm too far to do anything, right?

2789
03:19:06,927 --> 03:19:09,688
MATT: At the moment?

2790
03:19:09,688 --> 03:19:13,536
SAM: It has to be within 60 feet.

2791
03:19:13,536 --> 03:19:19,377
MATT: From Delilah? She's within 40 feet of you.

2792
03:19:19,377 --> 03:19:23,474
SAM: Can I retroactively Counterspell? (laughs)

2793
03:19:23,474 --> 03:19:31,482
MATT: Yeah. I'll let you do it. You have your
ability back, so I'll let you try for it.

2794
03:19:31,482 --> 03:19:35,496
MARISHA: Wait, with the Disintegrate? Go, Scanlan,
go!

2795
03:19:35,496 --> 03:19:39,199
TRAVIS: Do you have to roll for this?

2796
03:19:39,199 --> 03:19:41,146
SAM: I think I have to roll for this.

2797
03:19:41,146 --> 03:19:43,804
MATT: You roll and add your charisma modifier.

2798
03:19:43,804 --> 03:19:57,395
SAM: No. Charisma modifier? It's just an 11.

2799
03:19:57,395 --> 03:20:00,937
MATT: Plus two, because you get plus two bonus, so
13.

2800
03:20:00,937 --> 03:20:04,230
SAM: I can't add anything else.

2801
03:20:04,230 --> 03:20:06,466
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Can you inspire
yourself?

2802
03:20:06,466 --> 03:20:09,337
SAM: Not on a reaction, I don't think.

2803
03:20:09,337 --> 03:20:11,558
MARISHA: But you're a war bard, right?

2804
03:20:11,558 --> 03:20:13,447
MATT: He's not a war bard. He's a lore bard.

2805
03:20:13,447 --> 03:20:16,014
MARISHA: War caster.

2806
03:20:16,014 --> 03:20:21,203
TALIESIN: Oh man, this does not feel good.

2807
03:20:21,203 --> 03:20:23,418
SAM: Doesn't feel good.

2808
03:20:23,418 --> 03:20:25,239
TALIESIN: It does not feel good.

2809
03:20:25,239 --> 03:20:33,134
MATT: Peerless skill. When you make an ability
check. It's an ability check, technically.

2810
03:20:33,134 --> 03:20:34,375
SAM: What's that mean?

2811
03:20:34,375 --> 03:20:39,928
MATT: That means you can spend another bardic
inspiration to it because you're at a 13.

2812
03:20:39,928 --> 03:20:49,457
SAM: (nervous laughter) It's cocked. It would have
been 11. Four.

2813
03:20:49,457 --> 03:20:54,983
MATT: It's a 17? The spell is a 6th-level spell.
The DC is 16.

2814
03:20:54,983 --> 03:20:56,537
TALIESIN: Oh god!

2815
03:20:56,537 --> 03:20:58,179
LAURA: You're not disintegrated?

2816
03:20:58,179 --> 03:21:00,041
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

2817
03:21:00,041 --> 03:21:01,743
SAM: Matt is a gentle god.

2818
03:21:01,743 --> 03:21:12,662
MATT: In this flash of vision, Keyleth, you see
this happen, and then the bit of inspiration from

2819
03:21:12,662 --> 03:21:18,557
the Raven Queen that's been trying to push through
whatever is keeping her vision at bay here. Your

2820
03:21:18,557 --> 03:21:23,279
vision flashes back, and then you see Vax on the
ground, the extended finger of Delilah as the

2821
03:21:23,279 --> 03:21:27,238
green energy begins to spiral up from her finger,
and Scanlan in the back just says?

2822
03:21:27,238 --> 03:21:38,080
SAM: Oh. Hey, you know what the problem is with
your face? I can see it!

2823
03:21:38,080 --> 03:21:41,119
(laughter)

2824
03:21:41,119 --> 03:21:47,646
MATT: Delilah goes, "What?" and the spell
(fluttering noise) dissipates. (sighs)

2825
03:21:47,646 --> 03:21:52,197
MARISHA: That was a 6th-level spell?

2826
03:21:52,197 --> 03:21:53,619
MATT: Yeah.

2827
03:21:53,619 --> 03:21:55,120
MARISHA: Does she have any more of those?

2828
03:21:55,120 --> 03:21:56,573
LAURA: We don't know.

2829
03:21:56,573 --> 03:21:58,764
MARISHA: Because I only have two.

2830
03:21:58,764 --> 03:22:12,889
MATT: That being the case, Delilah is going to go
ahead and go. You do get an attack of opportunity

2831
03:22:12,889 --> 03:22:14,496
on her, Keyleth.

2832
03:22:14,496 --> 03:22:16,108
MARISHA: Just straight melee?

2833
03:22:16,108 --> 03:22:17,107
MATT: Straight melee.

2834
03:22:17,107 --> 03:22:18,812
TALIESIN: Hit her with a stick.

2835
03:22:18,812 --> 03:22:24,727
MARISHA: My dice suck.

2836
03:22:24,727 --> 03:22:27,999
LAURA: You've rolled shit on that dice every
time tonight.

2837
03:22:27,999 --> 03:22:35,316
MARISHA: It's not good. 13.

2838
03:22:35,316 --> 03:22:38,837
MATT: 13? No, that misses, unfortunately.

2839
03:22:38,837 --> 03:22:41,366
MARISHA: Fuck it.

2840
03:22:41,366 --> 03:22:45,479
MATT: Okay. Grog, it's your turn now.

2841
03:22:45,479 --> 03:22:53,504
TRAVIS: Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this?

2842
03:22:53,504 --> 03:22:54,765
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2843
03:22:54,765 --> 03:23:01,195
TRAVIS: Can I use my action to pick up my buddy
Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as

2844
03:23:01,195 --> 03:23:04,833
I can towards where Vex's body is laying.

2845
03:23:04,833 --> 03:23:07,128
MATT: Okay, so you're going to pick her up and
move?

2846
03:23:07,128 --> 03:23:10,479
TRAVIS: There's no difference, right?

2847
03:23:10,479 --> 03:23:13,548
MATT: You can pick her up and move and then throw
her to give her the most distance, but you can

2848
03:23:13,548 --> 03:23:18,444
only move half your speed as you're carrying her.
It's essentially an agreed-upon grapple. You'd be

2849
03:23:18,444 --> 03:23:20,292
able to move 25 feet with her.

2850
03:23:20,292 --> 03:23:23,995
TRAVIS: Versus picking her up and throwing her for
an athletics check, or something?

2851
03:23:23,995 --> 03:23:27,777
MATT: You can, but I don't know how far you'll
throw her that way. It's up to you. You can stay

2852
03:23:27,777 --> 03:23:29,659
where you are, if you'd like to.

2853
03:23:29,659 --> 03:23:32,841
ASHLEY: I'll make it.

2854
03:23:32,841 --> 03:23:34,617
TRAVIS: You think so?

2855
03:23:34,617 --> 03:23:38,191
ASHLEY: Yeah. I can make it to her.

2856
03:23:38,191 --> 03:23:40,643
LIAM: The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right
now.

2857
03:23:40,643 --> 03:23:43,320
TRAVIS: I should just go unload?

2858
03:23:43,320 --> 03:23:45,140
ASHLEY: Yeah, do your thing.

2859
03:23:45,140 --> 03:23:48,829
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

2860
03:23:48,829 --> 03:23:51,861
MATT: You are raging.

2861
03:23:51,861 --> 03:23:55,919
TRAVIS: Can I use my full speed to head towards
Delilah?

2862
03:23:55,919 --> 03:24:07,704
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get
right there.

2863
03:24:07,704 --> 03:24:13,745
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots
of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I

2864
03:24:13,745 --> 03:24:15,243
want to get within melee.

2865
03:24:15,243 --> 03:24:18,098
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

2866
03:24:18,098 --> 03:24:22,284
TRAVIS: That's a million. 25.

2867
03:24:22,284 --> 03:24:26,675
MATT: (impact) You land right in front of her. She
watches you as you (footsteps) run around the

2868
03:24:26,675 --> 03:24:30,915
side, leap, (impact) right in front of her, this
giant, hulking form of muscle.

2869
03:24:30,915 --> 03:24:34,945
TRAVIS: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.

2870
03:24:34,945 --> 03:24:38,275
TALIESIN: Turn her to fucking paste.

2871
03:24:38,275 --> 03:24:39,583
MATT: You have two attacks.

2872
03:24:39,583 --> 03:24:41,675
TRAVIS: Yeah, two attacks.

2873
03:24:41,675 --> 03:24:44,572
MARISHA: Why am I light-headed?

2874
03:24:44,572 --> 03:24:47,216
TRAVIS: Everything's going wrong.

2875
03:24:47,216 --> 03:24:50,633
TALIESIN: Well, that, and those drinks were really
inappropriate.

2876
03:24:50,633 --> 03:24:54,600
TRAVIS: 28?

2877
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:57,246
MATT: 28? Yeah, that hits.

2878
03:24:57,246 --> 03:25:20,500
TRAVIS: 19. 29. 35, and four because I'm enlarged.
35, total on the first one. And the second one,

2879
03:25:20,500 --> 03:25:30,649
19. Should have taken that other thing. That would
have been a crit. Minus five. 27?

2880
03:25:30,649 --> 03:25:33,277
MATT: 27 does hit, yes.

2881
03:25:33,277 --> 03:25:49,366
TRAVIS: Boy, she's got a high AC, doesn't she? 10,
24, 34, three points of necrotic for 37. That's a

2882
03:25:49,366 --> 03:25:54,328
d8. That's the wrong one. 36 points of damage.

2883
03:25:54,328 --> 03:26:00,596
MATT: As you rush forward and cleave into her with
hit after hit on the axe, you watch as her

2884
03:26:00,596 --> 03:26:06,469
imposing form is battered around and slashed
apart, and as you finish and withdraw the axe from

2885
03:26:06,469 --> 03:26:10,389
the two strikes, you see her already clutching her
stomach. (panting)

2886
03:26:10,389 --> 03:26:15,309
TRAVIS: An action surge is a bonus action, right?

2887
03:26:15,309 --> 03:26:16,846
MATT: No. Just an action surge.

2888
03:26:16,846 --> 03:26:18,416
TALIESIN: You can just do it.

2889
03:26:18,416 --> 03:26:20,113
TRAVIS: Should we empty the tank?

2890
03:26:20,113 --> 03:26:21,046
LAURA: Yeah.

2891
03:26:21,046 --> 03:26:22,518
TRAVIS: I'll use the action surge.

2892
03:26:22,518 --> 03:26:24,093
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

2893
03:26:24,093 --> 03:26:25,569
TALIESIN: Is that three more attacks?

2894
03:26:25,569 --> 03:26:26,813
MATT: Two more.

2895
03:26:26,813 --> 03:26:32,317
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon, all the shit.
Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked

2896
03:26:32,317 --> 03:26:36,234
that other thing, they would have been criticals.
28.

2897
03:26:36,234 --> 03:26:38,167
MATT: 28 hits, definitely.

2898
03:26:38,167 --> 03:26:53,708
TRAVIS: 17, 27, 29. That's a fucking d8 again.
31.

2899
03:26:53,708 --> 03:26:55,629
MATT: 31?

2900
03:26:55,629 --> 03:26:57,250
TRAVIS: 31 points of damage.

2901
03:26:57,250 --> 03:27:00,511
MATT: All righty. Second attack?

2902
03:27:00,511 --> 03:27:09,390
TRAVIS: 27.

2903
03:27:09,390 --> 03:27:11,632
MATT: Jesus. Yes, that hits.

2904
03:27:11,632 --> 03:27:26,661
TRAVIS: I'm a monstrous thing. That's a 12, 26,
36, 38, 40,

2905
03:27:26,661 --> 03:27:29,303
including the enlarged and the necrotic.

2906
03:27:29,303 --> 03:27:34,502
MATT: You slam her with the two extra attacks,
knocking her back. As the two additional axe blows

2907
03:27:34,502 --> 03:27:38,237
slice across the front of her chest, one gets her
on the side of her chin. You can see, you've

2908
03:27:38,237 --> 03:27:43,707
carved the cheek open and broken teeth, and now
when she looks back to you, you can see all of her

2909
03:27:43,707 --> 03:27:48,786
back molars and teeth now, this horrible Joker
grin on one side of her face as the blood leaks

2910
03:27:48,786 --> 03:27:57,516
out. You can see the one gleaming greenish-yellow
glowing eye flares open at you. She (spits).

2911
03:27:57,516 --> 03:28:00,345
TRAVIS: Don't stop smiling on my account.

2912
03:28:00,345 --> 03:28:17,212
MATT: That ends your turn, Grog... All right, so
ghostly claws begin to spring up from the ground

2913
03:28:17,212 --> 03:28:18,690
in a 20-foot radius.

2914
03:28:18,690 --> 03:28:21,767
TRAVIS: Did you say claws?

2915
03:28:21,767 --> 03:28:22,912
MATT: Claws, yes.

2916
03:28:22,912 --> 03:28:24,576
SAM: Ghostly claws.

2917
03:28:24,576 --> 03:28:36,419
MATT: Right there. I need-- Vax fails. I need
Keyleth and Grog and Trinket to all make dexterity

2918
03:28:36,419 --> 03:28:38,614
saving throws. Sorry, strength saving throws.

2919
03:28:38,614 --> 03:28:41,363
LAURA: He can't do anything.

2920
03:28:41,363 --> 03:28:43,010
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

2921
03:28:43,010 --> 03:28:44,381
TALIESIN: Trinket can.

2922
03:28:44,381 --> 03:28:47,739
LAURA: Trinket can't still attack if I'm not
alive.

2923
03:28:47,739 --> 03:28:52,566
MATT: I'll let you. I'll let you, in the purposes
of you being dead, Trinket is going to act on his

2924
03:28:52,566 --> 03:28:54,950
own to defend you.

2925
03:28:54,950 --> 03:28:56,856
LAURA: He rolled a seven.

2926
03:28:56,856 --> 03:29:03,913
TALIESIN: He's about to be in a pocket dimension
really quick.

2927
03:29:03,913 --> 03:29:06,753
LAURA: Yeah, he might go into the pocket
dimension.

2928
03:29:06,753 --> 03:29:07,558
MATT: Grog?

2929
03:29:07,558 --> 03:29:08,626
TRAVIS: 22.

2930
03:29:08,626 --> 03:29:14,689
MATT: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage,
and are not grappled. You take ten points of

2931
03:29:14,689 --> 03:29:20,888
necrotic damage, reduced to half, five, because of your
armor, and you are

2932
03:29:20,888 --> 03:29:24,791
grappled and paralyzed. Keyleth?

2933
03:29:24,791 --> 03:29:25,873
MARISHA: 22.

2934
03:29:25,873 --> 03:29:27,907
MATT: 22. You take five points of necrotic
damage.

2935
03:29:27,907 --> 03:29:32,086
LAURA: And Trinket takes how much necrotic
damage?

2936
03:29:32,086 --> 03:29:46,822
MATT: Ten, and is grappled. Trinket's speed is
zero. All right. Welcome to the God Wars, guys.

2937
03:29:46,822 --> 03:29:50,541
TALIESIN: Not cool.

2938
03:29:50,541 --> 03:29:54,634
MARISHA: Why didn't we Heroes' Feast?

2939
03:29:54,634 --> 03:29:56,577
LAURA: It wouldn't have mattered.

2940
03:29:56,577 --> 03:30:01,392
LIAM: Let's get a god in here. Light or dark meat.
I don't care. One or the other. Get one of those

2941
03:30:01,392 --> 03:30:02,979
ladies in here!

2942
03:30:02,979 --> 03:30:13,338
MATT: (heavy footfalls) With these heavy, armored
footfalls as it walks, with its fingers forward,

2943
03:30:13,338 --> 03:30:20,473
it begins carving this sigil in the air. Grabs it
and turns it, and as it turns, you watch the same

2944
03:30:20,473 --> 03:30:25,590
sigil runes appear around Grog and begin to spiral
around you. Make a charisma saving throw, please.

2945
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:32,386
TRAVIS: Fuck, balls. Hey, y'all, plus one. Don't
worry. Four.

2946
03:30:32,386 --> 03:30:36,713
MATT: Grog, you vanish.

2947
03:30:36,713 --> 03:30:39,759
(groaning)

2948
03:30:39,759 --> 03:30:42,564
MATT: Banished from this realm of existence.

2949
03:30:42,564 --> 03:30:44,684
TRAVIS: No!

2950
03:30:44,684 --> 03:30:53,616
MATT: You appear on the ground in the Shadowfell,
in the gaping crater where Thar Amphala once

2951
03:30:53,616 --> 03:31:03,568
stood. You look around, up to the familiar cloudy,
dark sky, and are alone.

2952
03:31:03,568 --> 03:31:06,221
TRAVIS: Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell
anymore?

2953
03:31:06,221 --> 03:31:07,257
TALIESIN: No.

2954
03:31:07,257 --> 03:31:08,743
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Snow's falling.

2955
03:31:08,743 --> 03:31:11,767
LAURA: Wildemount, or some shit.

2956
03:31:11,767 --> 03:31:14,938
TRAVIS: Without a perception check, is anybody
around, or is it just me?

2957
03:31:14,938 --> 03:31:18,537
MATT: Nobody's around you, although you do look up
and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers,

2958
03:31:18,537 --> 03:31:21,522
swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet.

2959
03:31:21,522 --> 03:31:23,732
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

2960
03:31:23,732 --> 03:31:27,488
SAM: You've been banished to another dimension.
You can punch your way out of it.

2961
03:31:27,488 --> 03:31:30,483
TRAVIS: You know what? I only have one thought.

2962
03:31:30,483 --> 03:31:35,938
MARISHA: Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards,
y'all. He's going to turn to those cards.

2963
03:31:35,938 --> 03:31:37,651
TRAVIS: We've got this.

2964
03:31:37,651 --> 03:31:39,735
MATT: Keyleth, perception check.

2965
03:31:39,735 --> 03:31:40,783
MARISHA: What?

2966
03:31:40,783 --> 03:31:42,074
MATT: Perception check.

2967
03:31:42,074 --> 03:31:49,475
MARISHA: Ugh! Okay. That's good. 14 plus 13, so
27.

2968
03:31:49,475 --> 03:31:54,582
MATT: You do notice, the armored death knight
still has a hand out after Grog's banishing.

2969
03:31:54,582 --> 03:31:58,105
LAURA: Okay.

2970
03:31:58,105 --> 03:32:00,023
TALIESIN: Okay, that's good!

2971
03:32:00,023 --> 03:32:03,308
MATT: This doesn't appear to be Plane Shift.

2972
03:32:03,308 --> 03:32:11,832
MARISHA: So if I kill him, he'll come back? Or if
I kill him, Grog won't ever come back?

2973
03:32:11,832 --> 03:32:13,302
What does that mean?!

2974
03:32:13,302 --> 03:32:18,865
TALIESIN: We'll find out. We'll just lay waste to
shit until it stops happening. We're going to keep

2975
03:32:18,865 --> 03:32:22,999
doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops
happening.

2976
03:32:22,999 --> 03:32:26,065
LIAM: Pickle time.

2977
03:32:26,065 --> 03:32:32,512
TRAVIS: This is the worst grin you've ever given
us. It's so great.

2978
03:32:32,512 --> 03:32:37,248
MATT: We are at the end of the death knight's
turn. Vecna's going to use two legendary actions

2979
03:32:37,248 --> 03:32:39,430
to cast another spell.

2980
03:32:39,430 --> 03:32:46,553
ASHLEY: This feels like when we played in Liam's
one-shot when we got on the beach.

2981
03:32:46,553 --> 03:32:49,583
LIAM: I was just about to say, this is revenge for
Demogorgon!

2982
03:32:49,583 --> 03:32:51,505
TALIESIN: This is very much the beach, isn't it?

2983
03:32:51,505 --> 03:33:01,154
MATT: Vecna's going to shift further back on the
field to there.

2984
03:33:01,154 --> 03:33:03,957
MARISHA: Is he always going to fucking fly?

2985
03:33:03,957 --> 03:33:06,608
MATT: Why wouldn't he?

2986
03:33:06,608 --> 03:33:09,096
TALIESIN: Feet are passe.

2987
03:33:09,096 --> 03:33:15,496
MATT: As he glides over, he looks down and sees
the mess that Delilah's currently in. Looks around

2988
03:33:15,496 --> 03:33:20,714
and sees the options and says, "Well, I hate to
see work unfinished."

2989
03:33:20,714 --> 03:33:24,028
SAM: Again?

2990
03:33:24,028 --> 03:33:25,596
LIAM: Disintegrate?

2991
03:33:25,596 --> 03:33:26,793
MATT: Disintegrate again.

2992
03:33:26,793 --> 03:33:28,406
SAM: This is the same round, right?

2993
03:33:28,406 --> 03:33:30,401
MATT: This is the next round.

2994
03:33:30,401 --> 03:33:31,648
SAM: Can I try--

2995
03:33:31,648 --> 03:33:34,874
MATT: He moved out of your range.

2996
03:33:34,874 --> 03:33:36,193
SAM: Great.

2997
03:33:36,193 --> 03:33:41,243
MARISHA: No!

2998
03:33:41,243 --> 03:33:49,602
MATT: Now you see as a green ray fires down from
the Whispered One above, and within an instant--

2999
03:33:49,602 --> 03:33:53,476
MARISHA: Wait, can I bonus action him? Can I use
my bonus action?

3000
03:33:53,476 --> 03:33:55,879
MATT: Not on your turn.

3001
03:33:55,879 --> 03:33:57,585
TALIESIN: I've got nothing.

3002
03:33:57,585 --> 03:34:04,496
MATT: You turn to dust within the armor. Where
once Vax stood, the vision you saw flash you

3003
03:34:04,496 --> 03:34:10,810
thought might have been a warning, instead it was
an omen. You look down and see the raven wings

3004
03:34:10,810 --> 03:34:16,112
turn to ash, and now there is the empty armor of
the Raven Queen,

3005
03:34:16,112 --> 03:34:18,493
the daggers clattering to the stone.

3006
03:34:18,493 --> 03:34:23,477
TRAVIS: Oh man. What the fuck?

3007
03:34:23,477 --> 03:34:25,280
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

3008
03:34:25,280 --> 03:34:30,045
ASHLEY: I can't do what I was going to do. Fuck.

3009
03:34:30,045 --> 03:34:31,967
SAM: Laura.

3010
03:34:31,967 --> 03:34:37,138
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry. Hold on.

3011
03:34:37,138 --> 03:34:38,951
SAM: She can't reach you?

3012
03:34:38,951 --> 03:34:40,366
ASHLEY: Nope.

3013
03:34:40,366 --> 03:34:42,500
SAM: I can bring you to her.

3014
03:34:42,500 --> 03:34:45,355
MATT: You could hold your action and he could bamf
you over.

3015
03:34:45,355 --> 03:34:51,193
ASHLEY: When are you up?

3016
03:34:51,193 --> 03:34:53,024
SAM: I don't know.

3017
03:34:53,024 --> 03:34:56,375
LAURA: Do whatever you want.

3018
03:34:56,375 --> 03:35:00,379
SAM: You have to touch her?

3019
03:35:00,379 --> 03:35:01,597
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3020
03:35:01,597 --> 03:35:06,215
MATT: If you wanted to do something like that,
you'd have to begin casting it and hold your

3021
03:35:06,215 --> 03:35:08,895
action for him to take his turn, and then you
could take her there.

3022
03:35:08,895 --> 03:35:10,394
ASHLEY: Wait, who's up?

3023
03:35:10,394 --> 03:35:15,039
MATT: It's you, Percy, then Scanlan.

3024
03:35:15,039 --> 03:35:18,542
ASHLEY: Okay, so Percy's next, and then it's
Scanlan.

3025
03:35:18,542 --> 03:35:22,262
SAM: If we don't die in those two turns, yes.

3026
03:35:22,262 --> 03:35:29,541
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I
will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my

3027
03:35:29,541 --> 03:35:33,295
turn until Scanlan bamfs us.

3028
03:35:33,295 --> 03:35:37,947
SAM: I'm going to be a total dick and not do
that.

3029
03:35:37,947 --> 03:35:39,950
ASHLEY: There's no one in between us?

3030
03:35:39,950 --> 03:35:41,501
SAM: No, we're next to each other.

3031
03:35:41,501 --> 03:35:43,611
ASHELY: I mean, no one in between us, like the bad
guys.

3032
03:35:43,611 --> 03:35:45,296
SAM: Well, they can go whenever they want.

3033
03:35:45,296 --> 03:35:51,250
MATT: Delilah already took her turn. Scanlan?

3034
03:35:51,250 --> 03:35:52,911
SAM: Oh, it's my turn. Where's Percy?

3035
03:35:52,911 --> 03:35:54,441
MATT: Sorry. Percy, you're up next.

3036
03:35:54,441 --> 03:35:59,110
TALIESIN: I'm going to unload a few rounds of
Animus into Delilah, since she's still standing.

3037
03:35:59,110 --> 03:36:00,792
She's still standing?

3038
03:36:00,792 --> 03:36:02,001
MATT: She's still standing.

3039
03:36:02,001 --> 03:36:09,031
TALIESIN: All right. Let's drop a point of grit,
and let's get some advantage on this for Animus

3040
03:36:09,031 --> 03:36:20,596
shot number one. Come on, crit. Not a crit, but
still pretty decent. That's a 28 to hit?

3041
03:36:20,596 --> 03:36:22,397
MATT: 28 to hit? That will hit.

3042
03:36:22,397 --> 03:36:36,906
TALIESIN: That's not the full damage. Let's do
this, plus let's do that. That's 12 points of

3043
03:36:36,906 --> 03:36:41,408
piercing damage, five points of psychic damage,
and four points of necrotic damage.

3044
03:36:41,408 --> 03:36:47,009
MATT: Okay. Necrotic damage doesn't do anything,
unfortunately.

3045
03:36:47,009 --> 03:36:50,518
TALIESIN: I know. I'll keep that off, then, for
now.

3046
03:36:50,518 --> 03:36:53,618
MATT: Okay. She's looking really hurt.

3047
03:36:53,618 --> 03:37:02,655
TALIESIN: All right, let's take another shot. Same
thing, burning a grit because fuck it. And let's

3048
03:37:02,655 --> 03:37:06,929
make this one-- these are not the right dice to
roll. I'm really nervous. Let's make this one a

3049
03:37:06,929 --> 03:37:13,494
sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more
pain. Natural 20. That's a crit.

3050
03:37:13,494 --> 03:37:15,666
Let's get that grit back.

3051
03:37:15,666 --> 03:37:16,937
MARISHA: Kill her!

3052
03:37:16,937 --> 03:37:28,069
TALIESIN: I've got to use my pen! Don't shake me!
I shake so much on my own! That's 2d10 plus 2d6

3053
03:37:28,069 --> 03:37:36,527
psychic, so that's four points of psychic damage.
That was a terrible roll.

3054
03:37:36,527 --> 03:37:43,060
And 24 points of damage.

3055
03:37:43,060 --> 03:37:44,819
MARISHA: Is that doubled?

3056
03:37:44,819 --> 03:37:47,663
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible.

3057
03:37:47,663 --> 03:37:50,356
MATT: How do you want to do this on Delilah?

3058
03:37:50,356 --> 03:38:02,221
TALIESIN: (sighs) I take my second shot. I call,
Delilah? Even if we die, it's fucking worth it.

3059
03:38:02,221 --> 03:38:07,713
And I take it right in her good eye. I want me to
be the last thing she sees.

3060
03:38:07,713 --> 03:38:18,947
MATT: As she turns around, you watch that side of
her face explode, and she falls back, the force of

3061
03:38:18,947 --> 03:38:27,652
it knocking her off her feet. She (impact noise)
scatters across the stonework. You glance over,

3062
03:38:27,652 --> 03:38:30,103
and you can see her looking face-up, and the
little green eye in the

3063
03:38:30,103 --> 03:38:32,435
socket turns and looks towards you.

3064
03:38:32,435 --> 03:38:35,218
SAM: Wait, it's still working?

3065
03:38:35,218 --> 03:38:38,796
MATT: The eye turned and looked at you from within
the socket.

3066
03:38:38,796 --> 03:38:40,186
TALIESIN: But it's down.

3067
03:38:40,186 --> 03:38:42,574
SAM: There's a creature inside of her.

3068
03:38:42,574 --> 03:38:53,526
TALIESIN: Off. (sighs) For my third shot, Mr.
Armor. And I get another grit back because she's

3069
03:38:53,526 --> 03:38:58,638
dead. Armor. I'm taking-- what's he holding?

3070
03:38:58,638 --> 03:39:02,877
MATT: He currently has a longsword in one hand.
That's all he's currently holding.

3071
03:39:02,877 --> 03:39:06,981
TALIESIN: He's holding a longsword? Let's get rid
of that longsword. I'm going to hit him and make

3072
03:39:06,981 --> 03:39:08,584
him drop that longsword.

3073
03:39:08,584 --> 03:39:09,809
MATT: Okay.

3074
03:39:09,809 --> 03:39:17,390
TALIESIN: I'm burning a grit to make him drop it.
I know, this is a lot. I'm taking my third shot

3075
03:39:17,390 --> 03:39:27,245
with Animus, and this is going to be a
sharpshooter shot, and that's not a crit, but

3076
03:39:27,245 --> 03:39:30,896
that's pretty good. That's 29 to hit?

3077
03:39:30,896 --> 03:39:32,139
MATT: That hits.

3078
03:39:32,139 --> 03:39:46,466
TALIESIN: All right, so this is 1d10 plus 1d6.
That's terrible. That's 20 points of damage, two

3079
03:39:46,466 --> 03:39:52,481
points of psychic damage, and he has to make a
strength saving throw

3080
03:39:52,481 --> 03:39:58,125
or he drops his sword. DC 20.

3081
03:39:58,125 --> 03:40:04,248
MATT: He gets a 20 exactly. 15 plus five. But he
did take the damage, so he has to make a

3082
03:40:04,248 --> 03:40:08,834
concentration, which he makes. DC 11, because it's
half the damage.

3083
03:40:08,834 --> 03:40:13,555
TALIESIN: Concentration? Oh, for that. That's
fine. Just because we're at that point where I'm

3084
03:40:13,555 --> 03:40:18,599
panicking, let's burn an action surge. Boom. Three
more shots on the asshole.

3085
03:40:18,599 --> 03:40:22,926
MARISHA: Are you shooting at Vecna?

3086
03:40:22,926 --> 03:40:24,868
TALIESIN: No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's
laughing off my bullets.

3087
03:40:24,868 --> 03:40:26,732
MATT: Most of the impact deflects off the plate.

3088
03:40:26,732 --> 03:40:28,222
MARISHA: You're shooting at the death knight?

3089
03:40:28,222 --> 03:40:32,048
TALIESiN: I'm shooting at the death knight, so now
I'm going to do a grit shot. I'm going to burn for

3090
03:40:32,048 --> 03:40:40,555
dead-eye sharpshooter. That's 27?

3091
03:40:40,555 --> 03:40:44,593
MATT: 27? Okay, that hits.

3092
03:40:44,593 --> 03:40:52,056
TALIESIN: And that's-- oh my fucking god! 20
points of damage,

3093
03:40:52,056 --> 03:40:53,774
plus one point of psychic damage.

3094
03:40:53,774 --> 03:40:57,354
SAM: You're fine. You're good.

3095
03:40:57,354 --> 03:40:58,769
TALIESIN: Burning another--

3096
03:40:58,769 --> 03:41:02,337
SAM: It's the last thing.

3097
03:41:02,337 --> 03:41:11,805
TALIESIN: I've got more. I've got three more. I
keep killing things. That's 17 to hit?

3098
03:41:11,805 --> 03:41:18,050
MATT: 17. You watch as he's concentrating on that
one spell, and as the one shot hits him, the

3099
03:41:18,050 --> 03:41:21,299
second one, he puts his arm up and seems to
deflect it with his hand.

3100
03:41:21,299 --> 03:41:25,349
TALIESIN: Did he make a constitution save against
the last one?

3101
03:41:25,349 --> 03:41:26,966
MATT: Yes, he did.

3102
03:41:26,966 --> 03:41:40,834
TALIESIN: Okay. This is my last shot. I'm burning
another grit, and natural 20. Okay, so that's

3103
03:41:40,834 --> 03:41:45,913
going to be-- come on. That's better!

3104
03:41:45,913 --> 03:41:50,170
MATT: I forgot to mention. Vecna took extra damage
from your crit earlier.

3105
03:41:50,170 --> 03:42:04,871
TALIESIN: Yes, he did. He took 15 points of extra
damage, halved. 18, 21, 22, 23, 30 points of

3106
03:42:04,871 --> 03:42:13,198
damage, plus five psychic damage, and he's going
to take 15 points of damage, plus three psychic

3107
03:42:13,198 --> 03:42:14,433
damage next round.

3108
03:42:14,433 --> 03:42:21,790
MATT: That was a 16 and a one, so with his
constitution bonus, he saves.

3109
03:42:21,790 --> 03:42:23,468
He maintains concentration.

3110
03:42:23,468 --> 03:42:24,930
TALIESIN: Oh my fucking god!

3111
03:42:24,930 --> 03:42:28,092
MATT: It's hard to break. He was designed for
that.

3112
03:42:28,092 --> 03:42:31,911
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to
reload, and that's my fucking turn.

3113
03:42:31,911 --> 03:42:33,342
MATT: Okay.

3114
03:42:33,342 --> 03:42:35,359
SAM: That was a long turn.

3115
03:42:35,359 --> 03:42:36,407
TALIESIN: I know.

3116
03:42:36,407 --> 03:42:37,566
SAM: You did good.

3117
03:42:37,566 --> 03:42:39,829
MATT: All right. End of Percy's turn. Scanlan.

3118
03:42:39,829 --> 03:42:40,841
SAM: Okay.

3119
03:42:40,841 --> 03:42:42,416
MATT: Percy, do you want to move on your turn?

3120
03:42:42,416 --> 03:42:50,130
TALIESIN: No. There's nowhere. I'm as far away
from everybody as I can currently be.

3121
03:42:50,130 --> 03:42:52,073
There's nowhere else.

3122
03:42:52,073 --> 03:42:57,188
MATT: I'm letting you know, as it currently
stands. Delilah's down.

3123
03:42:57,188 --> 03:42:58,616
TALIESIN: Delilah's down.

3124
03:42:58,616 --> 03:43:04,926
MATT: And two figures that look pretty much
untouched. Scanlan?

3125
03:43:04,926 --> 03:43:06,612
MARISHA: What are you trying to say?

3126
03:43:06,612 --> 03:43:10,143
MATT: I'm saying, be mindful of your choices.

3127
03:43:10,143 --> 03:43:15,867
TALIESIN: You know what? I'm going to start making
a beeline straight for Keyleth. Fuck it. I'm going

3128
03:43:15,867 --> 03:43:20,346
to see if I can get some cover behind--

3129
03:43:20,346 --> 03:43:23,339
MARISHA: Are we going to bail? What do we do?

3130
03:43:23,339 --> 03:43:25,568
TALIESIN: I'm fucking bailing.

3131
03:43:25,568 --> 03:43:29,961
MATT: That's up to you. You do have one of them
down, and you have two--

3132
03:43:29,961 --> 03:43:34,577
TRAVIS: If you can bail--

3133
03:43:34,577 --> 03:43:35,617
MARISHA: But Grog.

3134
03:43:35,617 --> 03:43:38,148
TALIESIN: We can get Grog back. We've just got to
get everybody up.

3135
03:43:38,148 --> 03:43:41,049
TRAVIS: You don't even know where I am.

3136
03:43:41,049 --> 03:43:42,671
LIAM: You can find him.

3137
03:43:42,671 --> 03:43:44,385
MARISHA: What about you?

3138
03:43:44,385 --> 03:43:47,740
LIAM: I'm gone. There's no finding me. I'm gone.

3139
03:43:47,740 --> 03:43:49,429
TALIESIN: We're picking up armor.

3140
03:43:49,429 --> 03:43:50,484
MATT: Scanlan?

3141
03:43:50,484 --> 03:43:56,945
SAM: I grab Pikey-poo and Dimension Door straight
to Vex's beautiful dead body.

3142
03:43:56,945 --> 03:44:01,702
TRAVIS: Like a dead Juliet.

3143
03:44:01,702 --> 03:44:07,584
SAM: I will inspire Pike. I don't know if that
helps whatever ritual

3144
03:44:07,584 --> 03:44:09,502
you're about to do, but maybe.

3145
03:44:09,502 --> 03:44:12,128
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Revivify.

3146
03:44:12,128 --> 03:44:13,738
ASHLEY: What do you get if you're inspired?

3147
03:44:13,738 --> 03:44:17,391
MATT: You get a d12 that you can spend on
something. Which, as you release Revivify, you

3148
03:44:17,391 --> 03:44:21,961
reach down and grab the cold, lifeless hand of
Vex. I need you to roll a wisdom check.

3149
03:44:21,961 --> 03:44:24,409
SAM: With inspiration.

3150
03:44:24,409 --> 03:44:25,817
MATT: Should she need it.

3151
03:44:25,817 --> 03:44:30,387
ASHLEY: And don't I get gnome cunning, so I have
advantage on it?

3152
03:44:30,387 --> 03:44:35,240
MATT: No. It's not a saving throw. It's just a
check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

3153
03:44:35,390 --> 03:44:41,481
TALIESIN: We will grab everything we fucking can.

3154
03:44:41,481 --> 03:44:42,983
ASHLEY: 18.

3155
03:44:42,983 --> 03:44:46,670
MATT: 18? Yeah. Your breath comes in.

3156
03:44:46,670 --> 03:44:49,765
ASHLEY: Hi.

3157
03:44:49,765 --> 03:44:53,033
LAURA: Pike. Are they dead?

3158
03:44:53,033 --> 03:44:54,741
ASHLEY: No.

3159
03:44:54,741 --> 03:44:59,220
MATT: You look over to your side, and you see
Delilah on the ground, her head scattered and

3160
03:44:59,220 --> 03:45:05,801
exploded on the ground, the one yellowish-green
eye still moving around and taking in the scenery.

3161
03:45:05,801 --> 03:45:11,799
You glance up, and you see Vecna still lording
over, a big smile on his face. You see the other

3162
03:45:11,799 --> 03:45:18,689
armored knight walking around, the plated black
helmet guarding any expression except for these

3163
03:45:18,689 --> 03:45:22,298
glowing red dots, the eyes that peer through.

3164
03:45:22,433 --> 03:45:28,420
SAM: I'm using any movement I have to pick up the
dust of my fallen friend, if there is any dust.

3165
03:45:28,420 --> 03:45:31,798
MATT: There's the dust and his equipment. Those
are the two things that are left.

3166
03:45:31,798 --> 03:45:33,636
SAM: Pick up whatever I can.

3167
03:45:33,636 --> 03:45:37,174
MARISHA: Scoop him into a little vial.

3168
03:45:37,174 --> 03:45:38,846
LIAM: (vacuuming noises)

3169
03:45:38,846 --> 03:45:42,522
(laughter)

3170
03:45:42,522 --> 03:45:47,333
SAM: (fake sneeze) Oh no!

3171
03:45:47,333 --> 03:45:54,845
TALIESIN: This is no time for allergies. Fuck!

3172
03:45:54,845 --> 03:46:01,064
MATT: All right, so you get your hands up in the
armor and some dust and you gather it in your

3173
03:46:01,064 --> 03:46:07,735
hand. There's Scanlan. There's you. There's Vex,
Pike.

3174
03:46:07,735 --> 03:46:10,055
MARISHA: So we're all together?

3175
03:46:10,055 --> 03:46:12,801
MATT: Well, Percy's there and Grog is somewhere.

3176
03:46:12,801 --> 03:46:14,003
MARISHA: Percy.

3177
03:46:14,003 --> 03:46:15,490
TALIESIN: I got as far as I could.

3178
03:46:15,490 --> 03:46:18,650
SAM: I'm done. That's all I can do.

3179
03:46:18,650 --> 03:46:20,154
ASHLEY: So bonus action.

3180
03:46:20,154 --> 03:46:23,431
SAM: I don't know if you can do a bonus action.

3181
03:46:23,431 --> 03:46:24,784
ASHLEY: Can I do a bonus action?

3182
03:46:24,784 --> 03:46:25,794
MATT: Yeah.

3183
03:46:25,794 --> 03:46:27,024
ASHLEY: Okay.

3184
03:46:27,024 --> 03:46:32,899
TALIESIN: You need healing like a mother. Don't
shrug at me.

3185
03:46:32,899 --> 03:46:34,292
SAM: She's fine.

3186
03:46:34,292 --> 03:46:39,171
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Healing Word on Vex.

3187
03:46:39,171 --> 03:46:40,350
MATT: Level two?

3188
03:46:40,350 --> 03:46:46,432
ASHLEY: Level four.

3189
03:46:46,432 --> 03:46:49,806
MATT: Because you've already cast Revivify.

3190
03:46:49,806 --> 03:46:51,316
ASHLEY: Level two.

3191
03:46:51,316 --> 03:46:53,671
MATT: So 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier, I think.

3192
03:46:53,671 --> 03:46:57,525
SAM: I'm already rolling Vax.

3193
03:46:57,525 --> 03:47:03,179
LAURA: You're mixing him with your suude?

3194
03:47:03,179 --> 03:47:04,467
SAM: Yeah.

3195
03:47:04,467 --> 03:47:06,503
ASHLEY: Ten hit points.

3196
03:47:06,503 --> 03:47:10,137
SAM: Tuck it behind my ear for later.

3197
03:47:10,137 --> 03:47:16,492
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter anymore.

3198
03:47:16,492 --> 03:47:20,524
LAURA: I haven't seen Vax yet. I haven't seen what
happened.

3199
03:47:20,524 --> 03:47:22,024
ASHLEY: Can I move?

3200
03:47:22,024 --> 03:47:24,951
MATT: No, because you already took your turn.

3201
03:47:24,951 --> 03:47:28,073
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

3202
03:47:28,073 --> 03:47:32,493
MATT: So that ends your turn? Scanlan, you moved
up there and you grabbed the stuff. That's your

3203
03:47:32,493 --> 03:47:34,184
turn. Keyleth?

3204
03:47:34,184 --> 03:47:44,427
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay. Are we trying to get to me
so I can get us all out?

3205
03:47:44,427 --> 03:47:46,817
SAM: Yeah, but it's going to take another turn.

3206
03:47:46,817 --> 03:47:48,767
LAURA: For Percy to get there.

3207
03:47:48,767 --> 03:47:53,954
MARISHA: But everyone's coming this way, right?
Everyone's coming this way? Then I'm going to--

3208
03:47:53,954 --> 03:48:07,745
fucking hell. How does Fire Storm work? I know
it's ten ten-foot cubes. Does it have to be on the

3209
03:48:07,745 --> 03:48:18,980
ground, or can I hit him up there? Can I rain--
"justice rains from above!" Can I do that?

3210
03:48:18,980 --> 03:48:22,690
TALIESIN: I haven't touched that game in so long.

3211
03:48:22,690 --> 03:48:30,086
MATT: You can arrange as you wish. Each cube must
have at least one face adjacent to the face of

3212
03:48:30,086 --> 03:48:36,318
another cube. Yeah, you can. Choose a location you
see within range, so I don't see why you couldn't.

3213
03:48:36,318 --> 03:48:39,262
You can create a lava fall, essentially.

3214
03:48:39,262 --> 03:48:41,959
TALIESIN: You'd have to pick one of the two of them
to hit.

3215
03:48:41,959 --> 03:48:44,933
MATT: You pick one, and then you create a bunch of
cubes that chain off it.

3216
03:48:44,933 --> 03:48:46,670
TALIESIN: You can hit them both.

3217
03:48:46,670 --> 03:48:49,008
MARISHA: But I'm not going to be able to hit the
death knight and Vecna?

3218
03:48:49,008 --> 03:48:53,425
MATT: Probably not. Not without hitting Scanlan or
yourself in the process.

3219
03:48:53,425 --> 03:48:56,579
MARISHA: What if I got out of the way. Could I?

3220
03:48:56,579 --> 03:48:59,161
MATT: We can try it.

3221
03:48:59,161 --> 03:49:08,130
MARISHA: I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm
going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my

3222
03:49:08,130 --> 03:49:15,827
people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate
in a cool tornado-y thing.

3223
03:49:15,827 --> 03:49:25,572
MATT: Are there any material components for Fire
Storm? No, there is not. You can cast that in your

3224
03:49:25,572 --> 03:49:33,365
form. You levitate up. We'll say right there.

3225
03:49:33,365 --> 03:49:37,283
TALIESIN: There's a lot of dead bodies on the
ground, man.

3226
03:49:37,283 --> 03:49:46,378
MATT: I know. This is rough, man. We'll say
there.

3227
03:49:46,378 --> 03:49:49,470
MARISHA: That's high, but that's okay.

3228
03:49:49,470 --> 03:49:51,094
MATT: How high did you want it?

3229
03:49:51,094 --> 03:49:58,997
MARISHA: In between, but don't worry about it. I'm
going to right onto Vecna and try and swarm it down

3230
03:49:58,997 --> 03:50:01,370
towards the death knight.

3231
03:50:01,370 --> 03:50:02,999
MATT: How many cubes is it?

3232
03:50:02,999 --> 03:50:04,652
MARISHA: Ten ten-foot cubes.

3233
03:50:04,652 --> 03:50:19,032
MATT: That's ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

3234
03:50:19,032 --> 03:50:21,645
Just barely get him. Just barely.

3235
03:50:21,645 --> 03:50:29,013
TALIESIN: That will do.

3236
03:50:29,013 --> 03:50:31,811
MATT: Hold on.

3237
03:50:31,811 --> 03:50:33,504
MARISHA: What do you mean, hold on?

3238
03:50:33,504 --> 03:50:37,296
TRAVIS: There are some legendary things that I
think might be happening.

3239
03:50:37,296 --> 03:50:38,534
TALIESIN: I get that vibe.

3240
03:50:38,534 --> 03:50:43,991
MATT: Not legendary. As you swarm up and begin to
formulate the spell, Vecna looks at at you, and

3241
03:50:43,991 --> 03:50:49,579
you can see with the vacant space where the hand
is, there's almost an arcane flash of a hand that

3242
03:50:49,579 --> 03:50:52,368
goes, (clicks tongue). He's going to attempt to
Counterspell you.

3243
03:50:52,368 --> 03:50:55,110
TALIESIN: Roll a one!

3244
03:50:55,110 --> 03:50:59,917
MARISHA: What does he have to roll? Under my DC?

3245
03:50:59,917 --> 03:51:08,334
MATT: It has to beat your DC. No, sorry. The level
of the spell, which would be 17. Which succeeds.

3246
03:51:08,334 --> 03:51:16,932
He rolled a 14 plus ten, so 24. As you formulate
the spell, you watch as the flames sputter out.

3247
03:51:16,932 --> 03:51:18,896
LAURA: Can you come back down to the ground?

3248
03:51:18,896 --> 03:51:20,857
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit.

3249
03:51:20,857 --> 03:51:24,395
MATT: You were about there, and with your flying
speed, you can land back down on the ground if you

3250
03:51:24,395 --> 03:51:32,110
want. Sorry. Is that your turn, Keyleth?

3251
03:51:32,110 --> 03:51:34,777
MARISHA: I guess so.

3252
03:51:34,777 --> 03:51:36,556
MATT: Okay.

3253
03:51:36,556 --> 03:51:43,726
LAURA: What does it look like when you're looking
out at all of us and we're so sad?

3254
03:51:43,726 --> 03:51:45,114
MATT: It feels awful.

3255
03:51:45,114 --> 03:51:46,849
TRAVIS: I love it!

3256
03:51:46,849 --> 03:51:48,825
TALIESIN: You're a liar. You're a lying liar.

3257
03:51:48,825 --> 03:51:53,495
MATT: It legitimately feels awful, but we were
building to this for a long time.

3258
03:51:53,495 --> 03:51:54,948
I've got to play it.

3259
03:51:54,948 --> 03:51:56,116
TRAVIS: There's a god floating in the air.

3260
03:51:56,116 --> 03:51:57,093
MATT: Not a god yet.

3261
03:51:57,093 --> 03:51:58,141
TRAVIS: Not a god yet.

3262
03:51:58,141 --> 03:51:59,499
MATT: That you know of.

3263
03:51:59,499 --> 03:52:04,110
LAURA: He'll be a god in our next damn campaign
when we're all dead.

3264
03:52:04,110 --> 03:52:09,973
MATT: He's going to use his last legendary action
at the end of Keyleth's turn to cast a cantrip at

3265
03:52:09,973 --> 03:52:15,471
you, Vex, as you just got back to consciousness.
He's going to reach out with a Flame Bolt.

3266
03:52:15,471 --> 03:52:19,927
LAURA: It's because I called him a dipshit when he
was talking earlier.

3267
03:52:19,927 --> 03:52:21,540
TRAVIS: You did blurt that out.

3268
03:52:21,540 --> 03:52:23,328
MATT: You did. You did taunt him.

3269
03:52:23,328 --> 03:52:29,401
LAURA: He is a dipshit. Before he does his
cantrip, I'm going to go, you can go ahead and

3270
03:52:29,401 --> 03:52:33,270
live forever, but you'll still be fucking ugly the
whole damn time!

3271
03:52:33,270 --> 03:52:36,439
(laughter)

3272
03:52:36,439 --> 03:52:44,792
MATT: Disadvantage because you're prone on the
ground and it's a ranged attack. That is a two

3273
03:52:44,792 --> 03:52:46,760
plus 16. That is an 18.

3274
03:52:46,760 --> 03:52:48,631
LAURA: To my armor class? He doesn't hit.

3275
03:52:48,631 --> 03:52:53,291
MATT: I rolled a natural 20 and a two, by the way,
so if you weren't prone?

3276
03:52:53,291 --> 03:52:55,363
TALIESIN: He would have--

3277
03:52:55,363 --> 03:52:56,848
LAURA: Destroyed me.

3278
03:52:56,848 --> 03:52:59,221
TRAVIS: You would be dust.

3279
03:52:59,221 --> 03:53:07,791
MATT: As he points down with his still-missing
hand, releases this bolt and you see this flare up

3280
03:53:07,791 --> 03:53:12,095
in the air and rush towards you, and you roll out
of the way and it (impact noise) slams into the

3281
03:53:12,095 --> 03:53:15,837
stone below you. You hear it crack and break the
area where your head once was.

3282
03:53:15,837 --> 03:53:19,193
Now it's Vecna's turn.

3283
03:53:19,193 --> 03:53:21,729
TRAVIS: Now. (laughs) Now?

3284
03:53:21,729 --> 03:53:25,926
ASHLEY: That wasn't his turn?

3285
03:53:25,926 --> 03:53:27,796
MATT: That was a legendary action.

3286
03:53:27,796 --> 03:53:32,722
ASHLEY: That was a legendary action? That's right.
I don't want any of it!

3287
03:53:32,722 --> 03:53:34,714
TALIESIN: None of us want this.

3288
03:53:34,714 --> 03:53:36,426
TRAVIS: I don't want it! I don't like it!

3289
03:53:36,426 --> 03:53:38,874
ASHLEY: I don't even want to play.

3290
03:53:38,874 --> 03:53:46,723
TRAVIS: Taryon's back in Whitestone having a
fucking ball.

3291
03:53:46,723 --> 03:53:48,572
TALIESIN: Taryon's sitting with a cup of tea.

3292
03:53:48,572 --> 03:53:52,837
SAM: No, Taryon's on the floor, weeping, holding
his necklace.

3293
03:53:52,837 --> 03:53:56,894
ALL: Oh!

3294
03:53:56,894 --> 03:54:00,273
ASHLEY: He doesn't know who it is.

3295
03:54:00,273 --> 03:54:03,649
TALIESIN: We've got one way down. We are all
having the thumpa-thumpa right now.

3296
03:54:03,649 --> 03:54:06,256
LAURA: It's red. All flashing red.

3297
03:54:06,256 --> 03:54:07,723
MATT: Okay.

3298
03:54:07,723 --> 03:54:10,701
ASHLEY: Why did you say okay that way?

3299
03:54:10,701 --> 03:54:14,366
SAM: Liam can be Taryon now! (laughs)

3300
03:54:14,366 --> 03:54:17,714
TALIESIN: You're terrible.

3301
03:54:17,714 --> 03:54:24,984
SAM: No! It's an established character we already
have artwork for. Why let it go to waste? He's

3302
03:54:24,984 --> 03:54:27,495
done prissy boys before.

3303
03:54:27,495 --> 03:54:29,463
TRAVIS: Look at Matt's face.

3304
03:54:29,463 --> 03:54:36,194
MATT: Vecna's going to lean down, seeing that you
just brought life back to Vex--

3305
03:54:36,194 --> 03:54:37,930
TRAVIS: Don't you do it!

3306
03:54:37,930 --> 03:54:42,314
LAURA: Matthew, don't do it!

3307
03:54:42,314 --> 03:54:44,141
MATT: "Join your friend."

3308
03:54:44,141 --> 03:54:45,832
ALL: No!

3309
03:54:45,832 --> 03:54:47,966
SAM: I will 6th-level Counterspell.

3310
03:54:47,966 --> 03:54:51,012
(cheering)

3311
03:54:51,012 --> 03:54:53,841
TRAVIS: We will not go quietly into the night!

3312
03:54:53,841 --> 03:55:00,893
SAM: I will sing at him, (singing) Counterspell,
baby don't hurt me.

3313
03:55:00,893 --> 03:55:05,844
Don't hurt me no more. Counterspell!

3314
03:55:05,844 --> 03:55:07,977
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20.

3315
03:55:07,977 --> 03:55:11,572
MATT: It's a 7th-level Finger of Death.

3316
03:55:11,723 --> 03:55:13,383
LAURA: Is that a natural 20?

3317
03:55:13,383 --> 03:55:14,667
TALIESIN: No.

3318
03:55:14,667 --> 03:55:17,754
MARISHA: Scanlan! No!

3319
03:55:17,754 --> 03:55:21,716
TRAVIS: What is this up and down cardiac arrrest
game?

3320
03:55:21,716 --> 03:55:23,357
MATT: Natural one?

3321
03:55:23,357 --> 03:55:24,971
TALIESIN: Stop rolling that die.

3322
03:55:24,971 --> 03:55:27,158
LAURA: And you're below 100?

3323
03:55:27,158 --> 03:55:28,697
TRAVIS: It really is a one?

3324
03:55:28,697 --> 03:55:30,080
TALIESIN: It really was a one.

3325
03:55:30,080 --> 03:55:33,089
SAM: I can add things to it, right?

3326
03:55:33,089 --> 03:55:34,172
TALIESIN: No, you can't.

3327
03:55:34,172 --> 03:55:38,125
MATT: 7d8. I need you to make a constitution
saving throw.

3328
03:55:38,125 --> 03:55:40,595
ASHLEY: I make a constitution saving throw? Okay.

3329
03:55:40,595 --> 03:55:41,673
SAM: You're still inspired.

3330
03:55:41,673 --> 03:55:43,026
LAURA: You're inspired!

3331
03:55:43,026 --> 03:55:45,077
ASHLEY: "You're spired!"

3332
03:55:45,077 --> 03:55:47,040
LAURA: Inspired. Use it!

3333
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:48,543
ASHLEY: Okay.

3334
03:55:48,543 --> 03:55:53,235
TRAVIS: It's a d10, right?

3335
03:55:53,235 --> 03:55:54,894
SAM: d12 on top of that.

3336
03:55:54,894 --> 03:55:56,427
MATT: What did you roll?

3337
03:55:56,427 --> 03:55:57,729
ASHLEY: 13.

3338
03:55:57,729 --> 03:56:00,647
LIAM: Plus the inspiration.

3339
03:56:00,647 --> 03:56:06,520
ASHLEY: No, just the 13. Plus-- 19?

3340
03:56:06,520 --> 03:56:10,695
MATT: No. You take 67 points of necrotic damage.

3341
03:56:10,695 --> 03:56:13,706
LAURA: It wasn't Power Word Kill, it was Finger of
Death?

3342
03:56:13,706 --> 03:56:18,372
MATT: No, he'd already used his Power Word Kill.
Remember, he's not a god yet.

3343
03:56:18,372 --> 03:56:21,011
ASHLEY: Okay.

3344
03:56:21,011 --> 03:56:22,872
LAURA: Just the one. Just the one Power Word
Kill.

3345
03:56:22,872 --> 03:56:25,197
TRAVIS: The fact that he's not a god gives me
diarrhea feelings.

3346
03:56:25,197 --> 03:56:28,256
ASHLEY: Okay.

3347
03:56:28,256 --> 03:56:36,990
MATT: All right, and he's going to move back a
bit, frustrated at the--

3348
03:56:36,990 --> 03:56:41,369
SAM: At everything.

3349
03:56:41,369 --> 03:56:48,629
MATT: At your attempts to Counterspell. Actually,
no. He laughed at that. "Nice try."

3350
03:56:48,629 --> 03:56:51,303
SAM: It wasn't my best performance.

3351
03:56:51,303 --> 03:56:56,796
MATT: All right, that's going to end his turn.
Delilah's out. Grog.

3352
03:56:56,796 --> 03:56:59,791
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3353
03:56:59,791 --> 03:57:05,377
MATT: Make a stealth check.

3354
03:57:05,377 --> 03:57:08,590
TRAVIS: Cool. Right. Pass Without a Trace is still
going, right?

3355
03:57:08,590 --> 03:57:09,735
MATT: Nope.

3356
03:57:09,735 --> 03:57:12,568
TRAVIS: That's a one.

3357
03:57:12,568 --> 03:57:15,808
TALIESIN: Hello?

3358
03:57:15,808 --> 03:57:29,393
MATT: As you're there, Grog, you hear
(screeching). A cloud of screeches, as about nine

3359
03:57:29,393 --> 03:57:35,116
of these gloom stalkers all start (whoosh) going
into a dive towards you.

3360
03:57:35,116 --> 03:57:37,486
SAM: Maybe one of them is our friend Mr.
Mistoffelees.

3361
03:57:37,486 --> 03:57:39,777
MARISHA: Mr. Mistoffelees, come back!

3362
03:57:39,777 --> 03:57:44,772
TRAVIS: Am I going to do anything? How far away is
the nearest structure?

3363
03:57:44,772 --> 03:57:52,432
MATT: Nothing. It's a crater. You're where the
city used to be. You have at least a mile to each

3364
03:57:52,432 --> 03:57:54,216
side of nothing but crater.

3365
03:57:54,216 --> 03:57:55,600
TALIESIN: Fuck!

3366
03:57:55,600 --> 03:57:59,119
ASHLEY: He's all by his lonesome!

3367
03:57:59,119 --> 03:58:01,559
TALIESIN: One more round.

3368
03:58:01,559 --> 03:58:05,948
SAM: He doesn't know.

3369
03:58:05,948 --> 03:58:07,769
MARISHA: He could be stuck there forever!

3370
03:58:07,769 --> 03:58:10,295
TALIESIN: There's nothing we can do right now.

3371
03:58:10,295 --> 03:58:21,672
TRAVIS: I'm going to go into a frenzied rage, and
I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus

3372
03:58:21,672 --> 03:58:31,129
my fighter level. Three, six. Six points, yay.

3373
03:58:31,129 --> 03:58:34,156
TALIESIN: How close to you do we have to be?

3374
03:58:34,156 --> 03:58:35,801
MARISHA: We have to be touching.

3375
03:58:35,801 --> 03:58:38,527
SAM: And you have to not be wind.

3376
03:58:38,527 --> 03:58:40,877
MARISHA: I can be wind now.

3377
03:58:40,877 --> 03:58:43,413
TRAVIS: I don't have any fighter things, so that's
my turn.

3378
03:58:43,413 --> 03:58:59,777
MATT: That's your turn. Okay. Ending your turn.
Dark energy suffuses the landscape in the area.

3379
03:58:59,777 --> 03:59:05,478
Actually, no. I'm not going to use that one
because nobody has necrotic resistance right now.

3380
03:59:05,478 --> 03:59:10,021
More undead are going to pop up. Let's see how
many. That's actually a shitty roll.

3381
03:59:10,021 --> 03:59:14,558
Four undead pop up.

3382
03:59:14,558 --> 03:59:23,449
TALIESIN: They're bullshit. We don't care.

3383
03:59:23,449 --> 03:59:33,856
MATT: All righty. That's going to be an attack on
you. It has advantage because you're prone and

3384
03:59:33,856 --> 03:59:39,655
it's in melee. That's a 17. Still doesn't hit.
High armor. You're ducking out of the way. The

3385
03:59:39,655 --> 03:59:46,842
skeleton is (tink) hitting the ground. It's also
attacking at you, Pike. That's cocked. Natural

3386
03:59:46,842 --> 03:59:52,999
one. It goes to strike you, and it doesn't even
hit you. The holy symbol of Sarenrae flares, and

3387
03:59:52,999 --> 03:59:59,486
it (raspy cry) pulls away from the blast of
vibrant, radiant energy. There's going to be one

3388
03:59:59,486 --> 04:00:03,280
attacking you, Scanlan. That is a 20 to hit?

3389
04:00:03,280 --> 04:00:04,452
SAM: Oh yeah.

3390
04:00:04,452 --> 04:00:11,705
MATT: All right. You take eight points of slashing
damage. And attacking you,

3391
04:00:11,705 --> 04:00:13,668
Percival, that's another 20.

3392
04:00:13,668 --> 04:00:15,000
TALIESIN: That is my armor class.

3393
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:20,941
MATT: It hits you. You take 11 points of slashing
damage as it cuts through you.

3394
04:00:20,941 --> 04:00:29,807
TALIESIN: I don't even acknowledge its existence.
I am definitely not amused.

3395
04:00:29,807 --> 04:00:36,533
MARISHA: What was the name of that one city, you
guys?

3396
04:00:36,533 --> 04:00:38,636
TALIESIN: Where is your dad from?

3397
04:00:38,636 --> 04:00:41,402
MARISHA: Syngorn. Is Syngorn still in the
Feywild?

3398
04:00:41,402 --> 04:00:42,771
LAURA: No.

3399
04:00:42,771 --> 04:00:44,287
TALIESIN: Damn it.

3400
04:00:44,287 --> 04:00:47,740
MARISHA: Where did we go? What city in the Feywild
did we go to?

3401
04:00:47,740 --> 04:00:50,641
LAURA: We can go to the pond.

3402
04:00:50,641 --> 04:00:52,283
TRAVIS: The death knight.

3403
04:00:52,283 --> 04:00:59,096
MATT: Steps forward, seeing Scanlan attempt to
shrug off all these spells, comes rushing forward,

3404
04:00:59,096 --> 04:01:06,703
and you watch as its blade begins to empower this
dark, black shadow, similar to the gloom stalkers

3405
04:01:06,703 --> 04:01:11,929
you've seen before. As he brings the sword and
arcs it down with tremendous might, you hear the

3406
04:01:11,929 --> 04:01:18,226
crack of thunder as this Staggering Smite slams
into you, or tries to, at least.

3407
04:01:18,226 --> 04:01:19,862
SAM: That sounds bad.

3408
04:01:19,862 --> 04:01:22,789
TALIESIN: That's bad. Do you have a reaction?

3409
04:01:22,789 --> 04:01:24,478
SAM: I used it already.

3410
04:01:24,478 --> 04:01:25,755
MATT: Shitty roll. 16 to hit?

3411
04:01:25,755 --> 04:01:27,089
SAM: Oh yeah, that hits.

3412
04:01:27,089 --> 04:01:28,147
MATT: Okay.

3413
04:01:28,147 --> 04:01:31,864
SAM: I think I'm not attuned-- yeah.

3414
04:01:31,864 --> 04:01:46,827
MATT: You take ten points of slashing damage, plus
17 points of necrotic damage.

3415
04:01:46,827 --> 04:01:49,813
TALIESIN: 27.

3416
04:01:49,813 --> 04:02:02,543
MATT: And as part of the Staggering Smite, you
also take 14 points of psychic damage, and make a

3417
04:02:02,543 --> 04:02:04,084
wisdom saving throw.

3418
04:02:04,084 --> 04:02:11,246
SAM: Against magic? That's better. 17.

3419
04:02:11,246 --> 04:02:19,504
MATT: 17? His spell DC is 18, unfortunately. On a
failed save, you have a disadvantage on attack

3420
04:02:19,504 --> 04:02:23,759
rolls and ability checks, and you can't take
reactions until the end of your next turn, so you

3421
04:02:23,759 --> 04:02:25,135
can't Counterspell.

3422
04:02:25,135 --> 04:02:26,859
TALIESIN: Scanlan's getting whaled on.

3423
04:02:26,859 --> 04:02:30,223
SAM: Disadvantage on all attack rolls?

3424
04:02:30,223 --> 04:02:34,077
MATT: Oh, but that's a concentration spell, so
he's not going to maintain the concentration. You

3425
04:02:34,077 --> 04:02:38,915
take the damage, and he lets it go. You don't have
a disadvantage. Otherwise, he would lose other

3426
04:02:38,915 --> 04:02:40,215
bits of concentration.

3427
04:02:40,215 --> 04:02:42,160
LAURA: Other bits of concentration.

3428
04:02:42,160 --> 04:02:48,314
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Vex. Your
turn.

3429
04:02:48,314 --> 04:02:50,574
LAURA: (laughing) I get to go?

3430
04:02:50,574 --> 04:02:52,426
MATT: Yeah. Sorry!

3431
04:02:52,426 --> 04:02:53,812
SAM: You're alive.

3432
04:02:53,812 --> 04:02:58,066
MATT: Sorry, guys. You walked into the lion's
den.

3433
04:02:58,066 --> 04:02:59,881
LAURA: Oh yeah, we did.

3434
04:02:59,881 --> 04:03:01,714
LIAM: I never did a single thing in this fight.

3435
04:03:01,714 --> 04:03:07,581
LAURA: I know. This is the first thing I've done.
I stand up.

3436
04:03:07,581 --> 04:03:12,094
TALIESIN: If we're smart--

3437
04:03:12,094 --> 04:03:13,740
MARISHA: I can bring you back.

3438
04:03:13,740 --> 04:03:19,223
TALIESIN: I'm heading towards where you are. I'm
heading towards the deceased body of Delilah.

3439
04:03:19,223 --> 04:03:33,013
LAURA: I'm going to, as a bonus action, down my
biggest healing potion, which is one greater

3440
04:03:33,013 --> 04:03:34,648
healing potion.

3441
04:03:34,648 --> 04:03:36,059
MATT: Go for it.

3442
04:03:36,059 --> 04:03:41,241
LIAM: There's also a superior healing potion lying
on the ground amongst all my shit.

3443
04:03:41,241 --> 04:03:43,897
LAURA: No. It's in your armor.

3444
04:03:43,897 --> 04:03:47,375
MATT: Greater is 4d4 plus four.

3445
04:03:47,375 --> 04:03:49,351
SAM: Okay, it's something.

3446
04:03:49,351 --> 04:04:10,557
LAURA: 13 plus four is 17 healing points, and I'm
going to move closer to Keyleth.

3447
04:04:10,557 --> 04:04:15,480
TALIESIN: She can move to us. Never mind.

3448
04:04:15,480 --> 04:04:18,639
MARISHA: We have to all be holding hands, y'all.

3449
04:04:18,639 --> 04:04:24,057
LAURA: Can I put myself in between Percy and
Keyleth so I can reach my hand out?

3450
04:04:24,057 --> 04:04:28,574
TALIESIN: I'm going to be making a beeline for
everybody else. Everybody's in that big clump.

3451
04:04:28,574 --> 04:04:32,009
LAURA: We're all in a clump, so we can still
touch? I don't need to move anywhere in order to

3452
04:04:32,009 --> 04:04:34,575
be able to touch her?

3453
04:04:34,575 --> 04:04:36,986
TALIESIN: You'll be able to move before you cast
Plane Shift, right?

3454
04:04:36,986 --> 04:04:37,842
MARISHA: Yes.

3455
04:04:37,842 --> 04:04:44,158
TALIESIN: So as long as we're all touching, she
can get to us. We just need to clump, and I move

3456
04:04:44,158 --> 04:04:48,009
last, so I'm fine. Is that right? Yeah, I move
last.

3457
04:04:48,009 --> 04:04:53,065
MATT: Keyleth moves last. Keyleth and Scanlan.

3458
04:04:53,065 --> 04:04:59,360
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to shoot at the death
knight.

3459
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:00,687
MATT: Go for it.

3460
04:05:00,687 --> 04:05:09,945
LAURA: With my 21?

3461
04:05:09,945 --> 04:05:11,666
MATT: 21 actually hits.

3462
04:05:11,666 --> 04:05:18,434
LAURA: With my Blazing Bowstring, and I want to
make it a bramble shot.

3463
04:05:18,434 --> 04:05:20,732
TRAVIS: Hit him hard.

3464
04:05:20,732 --> 04:05:25,823
LAURA: Is anybody standing next to him?

3465
04:05:25,823 --> 04:05:28,444
MATT: Scanlan and Keyleth.

3466
04:05:28,444 --> 04:05:29,746
LAURA: Sweet.

3467
04:05:29,746 --> 04:05:33,701
MARISHA: Feel free to hit me. I don't care. I
can't be grappled.

3468
04:05:33,701 --> 04:05:36,547
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter. She just gets extra
points--

3469
04:05:36,547 --> 04:05:38,834
MARISHA: Oh, he's flanked.

3470
04:05:38,834 --> 04:05:59,183
LAURA: 23 plus eight is 31, right? 33 plus 1d6
lightning damage. 39, and then 3d6 sneak attack.

3471
04:05:59,183 --> 04:06:01,986
11 additional, so that's--

3472
04:06:01,986 --> 04:06:03,389
TRAVIS: 50.

3473
04:06:03,389 --> 04:06:10,517
LAURA: Oh, and the Blazing Bowstring. Six
additional from that.

3474
04:06:10,517 --> 04:06:17,814
MATT: 56 points of damage from one shot. That is a
23 on his strength save, so as the arrow hits, you

3475
04:06:17,814 --> 04:06:22,440
see the burst of flame. It pierces the armor, and
you see the brambles extend and tear around him.

3476
04:06:22,440 --> 04:06:28,449
He looks up at you and you watch as flames (fire
noises) burn out of the armor. The arrow burns

3477
04:06:28,449 --> 04:06:33,185
away, and the brambles ignite and fafll to ash
around him.

3478
04:06:33,185 --> 04:06:35,677
LAURA: Not surprising. What about his
concentration?

3479
04:06:35,677 --> 04:06:37,292
TALIESIN: Come on.

3480
04:06:37,292 --> 04:06:46,268
MATT: That's going to be... half of 56? Oh man,
he's going to have to roll really high.

3481
04:06:46,268 --> 04:06:49,431
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No!

3482
04:06:49,431 --> 04:06:52,104
MATT: Hold on. Half of 56 is--

3483
04:06:52,104 --> 04:06:53,539
SAM: 28.

3484
04:06:53,539 --> 04:06:57,336
MATT: 28. No, he rolled a 19 plus five.

3485
04:06:57,336 --> 04:07:01,983
(cheering)

3486
04:07:01,983 --> 04:07:08,542
MATT: As the flames ignite and burn around, the
impact still causes him to lose the spell, and you

3487
04:07:08,542 --> 04:07:18,505
watch as a vacuum fills, and Grog, just as you see
this barrage of gloom stalkers, ready to grab and

3488
04:07:18,505 --> 04:07:24,751
tear you apart, you (poof) out and then (whoosh)
appear in that space where you once were.

3489
04:07:24,751 --> 04:07:27,360
TRAVIS: Huh?

3490
04:07:27,360 --> 04:07:31,339
ASHLEY: Grog! You're back!

3491
04:07:31,339 --> 04:07:33,172
MARISHA: Grog, we've got to get out!

3492
04:07:33,172 --> 04:07:35,855
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vex?

3493
04:07:35,855 --> 04:07:37,394
LAURA: No, I get to attack him again.

3494
04:07:37,394 --> 04:07:38,439
MATT: Go for it.

3495
04:07:38,439 --> 04:07:40,887
TALIESIN: We're in a nice little clump, aren't
we?

3496
04:07:40,887 --> 04:07:52,285
LAURA: That one definitely hits. This is way less
damage. 20 damage on the second one.

3497
04:07:52,285 --> 04:07:58,511
MATT: All righty. You can sense there's shadow and
smoke pouring out from under the armor as the

3498
04:07:58,511 --> 04:08:03,591
frustration of lost concentration is there. The
second arrow hits the shoulder. Staring straight

3499
04:08:03,591 --> 04:08:05,006
at you, angrily.

3500
04:08:05,006 --> 04:08:07,047
LAURA: Keyleth, get us out of here?

3501
04:08:07,047 --> 04:08:08,767
MARISHA: Hold hands.

3502
04:08:08,767 --> 04:08:13,010
TALIESIN: I think we're all in physical contact,
at this point, except for me.

3503
04:08:13,010 --> 04:08:15,161
MATT: That ends Vex's turn?

3504
04:08:15,161 --> 04:08:16,893
LAURA: Where's Vax?

3505
04:08:16,893 --> 04:08:18,633
TALIESIN: Well...

3506
04:08:18,633 --> 04:08:20,522
MARISHA: We'll talk later!

3507
04:08:20,522 --> 04:08:23,177
TALIESIN: Working on it. Do you have all of his
stuff?

3508
04:08:23,177 --> 04:08:24,892
SAM: As much as I can carry.

3509
04:08:24,892 --> 04:08:28,657
MATT: Armor, daggers. Roll an investigation
check.

3510
04:08:28,657 --> 04:08:29,901
MARISHA: Dust?

3511
04:08:29,901 --> 04:08:32,833
LIAM: Boots, his voice says from beyond the
grave.

3512
04:08:32,833 --> 04:08:36,075
SAM: 30.

3513
04:08:36,075 --> 04:08:40,773
MATT: You rustled through the dust when you went
through and spent the turn grabbing what you can.

3514
04:08:40,773 --> 04:08:43,578
You get most of his important magical items.

3515
04:08:43,578 --> 04:08:44,844
MARISHA: And dust.

3516
04:08:44,844 --> 04:08:46,449
MATT: And a little bit of dust.

3517
04:08:46,449 --> 04:08:47,957
SAM: Those boots are gone!

3518
04:08:47,957 --> 04:08:53,399
TALIESIN: Next time we fight Vecna, he's going to
be wearing some very nice boots.

3519
04:08:53,399 --> 04:08:54,262
LAURA: No.

3520
04:08:54,262 --> 04:08:55,624
TALIESIN: I'm kidding.

3521
04:08:55,624 --> 04:08:58,489
LIAM: He'll be Finger of Deathing me double-time.

3522
04:08:58,489 --> 04:09:02,681
ASHLEY: Are we trying to get out of here? What are
we doing?

3523
04:09:02,681 --> 04:09:04,014
TALIESIN: We are trying to get out of here.

3524
04:09:04,014 --> 04:09:07,849
ASHLEY: But then what?! We still have to fight
him!

3525
04:09:07,849 --> 04:09:11,305
LAURA: Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a
little bit and figure out what we're doing.

3526
04:09:11,305 --> 04:09:12,687
TALIESIN: We're going to die here.

3527
04:09:12,687 --> 04:09:22,076
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll run to-- sorry, I'm stuttering.
Keyleth's doing it?

3528
04:09:22,076 --> 04:09:27,244
TALIESIN: As long as we're all touching, it
doesn't matter where Keyleth is, but Turn Undead

3529
04:09:27,244 --> 04:09:28,647
would help, maybe?

3530
04:09:28,647 --> 04:09:30,672
LAURA: Or heal us.

3531
04:09:30,672 --> 04:09:32,326
TALIESIN: Healing or Turn Undead.

3532
04:09:32,326 --> 04:09:33,912
ASHLEY: When's your turn up?

3533
04:09:33,912 --> 04:09:37,376
TALIESIN: I'm coming up, right?

3534
04:09:37,376 --> 04:09:39,286
LAURA: And you're holding your action, Keyleth?

3535
04:09:39,286 --> 04:09:41,279
MATT: Yes, after Pike's turn.

3536
04:09:41,279 --> 04:09:53,437
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to do Mass Cure Wounds at
6th level. Let's see.

3537
04:09:53,437 --> 04:10:02,467
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the ring of counting.
This is actually proving to be invaluable.

3538
04:10:02,467 --> 04:10:06,267
MARISHA: It's very handy.

3539
04:10:06,267 --> 04:10:10,505
LAURA: What? What did you just think of?

3540
04:10:10,505 --> 04:10:13,571
TRAVIS: Nothing.

3541
04:10:13,571 --> 04:10:17,090
TALIESIN: Later. We need a bigger boat.

3542
04:10:17,090 --> 04:10:23,263
ASHLEY: Fuck, this is a bad roll.

3543
04:10:23,263 --> 04:10:26,572
SAM: Is this a new round since my last
Counterspell?

3544
04:10:26,572 --> 04:10:32,911
MATT: What was the last one you countered and
failed? That was on Vecna's turn, so when it comes

3545
04:10:32,911 --> 04:10:34,490
back to your turn, it will be.

3546
04:10:34,490 --> 04:10:36,097
TALIESIN: Not yet.

3547
04:10:36,097 --> 04:10:39,647
ASHLEY: 26 points. I rolled so badly.

3548
04:10:39,647 --> 04:10:41,404
LAURA: 26 is great.

3549
04:10:41,404 --> 04:11:05,426
ASHLEY: And then... am I able to also, at this
point, see if I can channel divinity?

3550
04:11:05,426 --> 04:11:07,505
MATT: It's an action to do that.

3551
04:11:07,505 --> 04:11:22,141
ASHLEY: It's not like she's going to show up.
Okay. Sorry. I'm so hot.

3552
04:11:22,141 --> 04:11:27,436
SAM: That's what I say to myself every morning.

3553
04:11:27,436 --> 04:11:30,290
LIAM: Your extensions look good, but I feel like
that is...

3554
04:11:30,290 --> 04:11:37,745
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm just hanging out.

3555
04:11:37,745 --> 04:11:40,004
MATT: Okay. That's Pike's turn.

3556
04:11:40,004 --> 04:11:44,818
MARISHA: Are we all holding hands? Are we all in
position?

3557
04:11:44,818 --> 04:11:46,858
SAM: Wait, did you just cure our wounds?

3558
04:11:46,858 --> 04:11:48,701
TALIESIN: Yeah, we just got 26 points back.

3559
04:11:48,701 --> 04:11:54,523
ASHLEY: Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my
bonus action?

3560
04:11:54,523 --> 04:11:59,410
MATT: What level? No, because you already did a
higher-level. You can't do that, unfortunately.

3561
04:11:59,410 --> 04:12:01,459
SAM: You can do it to one person.

3562
04:12:01,459 --> 04:12:06,231
ASHLEY: I'll do one person. Who's closest to me?

3563
04:12:06,231 --> 04:12:08,025
TALIESIN: She's probably at the bottom.

3564
04:12:08,025 --> 04:12:11,057
ASHLEY: Where are you at? Oh yeah, you're nothing.
Let me do the Healing Word.

3565
04:12:11,057 --> 04:12:13,230
LAURA: You're nothing! You're nobody!

3566
04:12:13,230 --> 04:12:16,277
TRAVIS: You'll never mean nothing in this world!

3567
04:12:16,277 --> 04:12:27,823
MATT: At the end of your turn, Pike, Vecna's going
to go ahead and cast-- you hear the voice enter

3568
04:12:27,823 --> 04:12:38,283
your mind once more, Pike. "Don't worry. If you
love her that much, I'll send her to you." Make a

3569
04:12:38,283 --> 04:12:39,681
dexterity saving throw.

3570
04:12:39,681 --> 04:12:41,322
SAM: Oh no, dexterity.

3571
04:12:41,322 --> 04:12:44,125
MATT: Let me see if it's dexterity or
constitution. Let me check real fast.

3572
04:12:44,125 --> 04:12:46,772
LAURA: What's he doing?

3573
04:12:46,772 --> 04:12:49,024
SAM: He's trying to hurt our Pikey.

3574
04:12:49,024 --> 04:12:52,428
MATT: That is a dexterity. Make a dexterity saving
throw.

3575
04:12:52,428 --> 04:12:59,755
ASHLEY: 16.

3576
04:12:59,755 --> 04:13:03,440
TALIESIN: Nope.

3577
04:13:03,440 --> 04:13:08,027
ASHLEY: I knew it was too low.

3578
04:13:08,027 --> 04:13:10,047
MATT: All right. You take 78 points of force
damage.

3579
04:13:10,047 --> 04:13:11,052
ASHLEY: How much?

3580
04:13:11,052 --> 04:13:12,224
MATT: 78.

3581
04:13:12,224 --> 04:13:18,591
ASHLEY: 78. Okay. That is okay. I'm unconscious--

3582
04:13:18,591 --> 04:13:25,790
MATT: However, if it brings you to zero, it turns
you to dust.

3583
04:13:25,790 --> 04:13:27,339
LAURA: But her armor!

3584
04:13:27,339 --> 04:13:28,783
MATT: But the armor.

3585
04:13:28,783 --> 04:13:30,306
TRAVIS: Oh!

3586
04:13:30,306 --> 04:13:32,132
SAM: It never got her to zero.

3587
04:13:32,132 --> 04:13:35,307
MATT: As soon as you hit zero, the armor flickers
in, and the divine--

3588
04:13:35,307 --> 04:13:36,826
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3589
04:13:36,826 --> 04:13:39,850
TALIESIN: Which also means that all the fucking
skeletons take damage!

3590
04:13:39,850 --> 04:13:49,090
MATT: Yep. As the ray hits you and you feel your
flesh begin to dissipate, the blessing of Pelor

3591
04:13:49,331 --> 04:13:55,585
and the guidance of Sarenrae flicker into you, and
you watch as light and flames (explosion noise)

3592
04:13:55,585 --> 04:14:01,875
burst out of her like a Doctor regenerating. As
the fire consumes the area, roll your damage for

3593
04:14:01,875 --> 04:14:05,897
your armor. Thank you for reminding me of that.

3594
04:14:05,897 --> 04:14:07,557
TRAVIS: Plate of the Dawnmartyr, you guys.

3595
04:14:07,557 --> 04:14:09,309
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I know the stats of
the Dawnmartyr

3596
04:14:09,309 --> 04:14:11,655
really well right now, for reasons.

3597
04:14:11,768 --> 04:14:13,342
TRAVIS: They take 6d6 fire damage.

3598
04:14:13,342 --> 04:14:14,902
LAURA: 6d6 fire damage!

3599
04:14:14,902 --> 04:14:16,828
TRAVIS: The ones within melee.

3600
04:14:16,828 --> 04:14:20,370
MATT: To all hostile creatures, correct?

3601
04:14:20,370 --> 04:14:21,349
TALIESIN: Yep.

3602
04:14:21,349 --> 04:14:22,589
MATT: Not all creatures?

3603
04:14:22,589 --> 04:14:23,904
LAURA: All hostile.

3604
04:14:23,904 --> 04:14:25,579
MATT: That's a very important distinction.

3605
04:14:25,579 --> 04:14:28,679
LAURA: That was terrible!

3606
04:14:28,679 --> 04:14:36,238
ASHLEY: 14. You know what? It's fine. I'm alive.

3607
04:14:36,238 --> 04:14:42,317
MATT: Okay, so as the flames burn out, you watch
as the skeletons that catch flame, their bone

3608
04:14:42,317 --> 04:14:52,176
burning to black, but they're still standing.
Okay. That brings us to Percy.

3609
04:14:52,176 --> 04:14:54,972
ASHLEY: Nothing is going well!

3610
04:14:54,972 --> 04:14:57,876
TALIESIN: Are we a reasonable chain?

3611
04:14:57,876 --> 04:15:00,399
LAURA: Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the
touch.

3612
04:15:00,399 --> 04:15:07,087
TALIESIN: There's nobody breaking the chain? I'm
going to move six points in the direction of

3613
04:15:07,087 --> 04:15:14,446
Delilah because I'm going to bring her with me
because I don't want that dead body there. Do I

3614
04:15:14,446 --> 04:15:19,970
make it in six moves? And while I'm running, just
for fucking fun, I'm going to take three shots at

3615
04:15:19,970 --> 04:15:24,216
that armor, and I'm going to push him the fuck
back, if that's okay. I'm going to push that

3616
04:15:24,216 --> 04:15:26,921
knight back. I'm going to try and do a force
push.

3617
04:15:26,921 --> 04:15:29,017
LAURA: And you're saving your action until we're
all touching?

3618
04:15:29,017 --> 04:15:34,999
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's about to be. We're all
touching. Let's get rid of that fucker.

3619
04:15:34,999 --> 04:15:38,446
MARISHA: We are getting out of here, right?

3620
04:15:38,446 --> 04:15:40,200
TALIESIN: We're getting the fuck out of here.

3621
04:15:40,200 --> 04:15:42,084
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were saving your action.

3622
04:15:42,084 --> 04:15:45,682
MARISHA: I rolled a really fucking shitty
initiative.

3623
04:15:45,682 --> 04:15:54,427
TALIESIN: That's a 27 to hit? The knight.

3624
04:15:54,427 --> 04:15:55,956
MATT: That hits, yes.

3625
04:15:55,956 --> 04:16:04,294
TALIESIN: Okay, and that's a torso push. I'm only
going to take the one shot. I don't even care

3626
04:16:04,294 --> 04:16:06,589
anymore; I'm just pushing him away.

3627
04:16:06,589 --> 04:16:07,764
MATT: He's pushed ten feet?

3628
04:16:07,764 --> 04:16:09,338
TALIESIN: He's pushed ten feet back from my
position.

3629
04:16:09,338 --> 04:16:10,733
MATT: Does he make a save for that?

3630
04:16:10,733 --> 04:16:16,799
TALIESIN: There's no save for that, and then he
takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage,

3631
04:16:16,799 --> 04:16:24,356
plus six points psychic damage. But he's ten feet
back. We're all touching. I'm going to save the

3632
04:16:24,356 --> 04:16:28,286
rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in
the way of this shit. If anybody interrupts us,

3633
04:16:28,286 --> 04:16:33,318
I've got two more shots ready to go. Also burning
a heal for fun, as well.

3634
04:16:33,318 --> 04:16:34,882
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

3635
04:16:34,882 --> 04:16:40,297
SAM: I will Lightning Bolt at level four the armor
knight guy.

3636
04:16:40,297 --> 04:16:42,506
TALIESIN: I'm also holding onto Delilah.

3637
04:16:42,506 --> 04:16:45,201
SAM: He's behind me, so I'll do it from my ass.

3638
04:16:45,201 --> 04:16:49,554
(laughter)

3639
04:16:49,554 --> 04:16:54,204
LIAM: I love you so much.

3640
04:16:54,204 --> 04:16:59,050
SAM: I'll lift up my leg a little bit. Squeeze it
out.

3641
04:16:59,050 --> 04:17:00,911
LIAM: Like a dog at a fire hydrant.

3642
04:17:00,911 --> 04:17:07,359
SAM: It's 8d6, but at level four it's 9d6, I
think?

3643
04:17:07,359 --> 04:17:14,108
MATT: Level four, it's 9d6, yeah. He did not make
his save. He rolled a nine plus six. 15.

3644
04:17:14,108 --> 04:17:20,288
TALIESIN: Yay! I'm not quite at full.

3645
04:17:20,288 --> 04:17:25,107
MATT: He has advantage on his saves against
magical effects and spells. He rolled worse.

3646
04:17:25,107 --> 04:17:27,135
SAM: 35.

3647
04:17:27,135 --> 04:17:33,386
MATT: 35 points of damage. The bolt (lightning
noise) through him at the same time he's blasted

3648
04:17:33,386 --> 04:17:39,917
back by Percy's hit and skids. You see the smoke
rise up. Like the Terminator,

3649
04:17:39,917 --> 04:17:41,337
he keeps moving forward.

3650
04:17:41,337 --> 04:17:48,220
SAM: I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits
of Vax I can still see.

3651
04:17:48,220 --> 04:17:49,655
TALIESIN: Put your hands in it.

3652
04:17:49,655 --> 04:17:51,244
SAM: And get into "posish."

3653
04:17:51,244 --> 04:17:53,484
TALIESIN: We're ready to burn.

3654
04:17:53,484 --> 04:18:05,613
SAM: I will bonus action Healing Word Pikey-poo,
which is for me-- what is Healing Word?

3655
04:18:05,613 --> 04:18:09,141
It's 2d4 plus six?

3656
04:18:09,141 --> 04:18:11,568
MATT: Yes.

3657
04:18:11,568 --> 04:18:17,229
SAM: Ten.

3658
04:18:17,229 --> 04:18:20,024
MATT: At the end of Scanlan's turn--

3659
04:18:20,024 --> 04:18:21,902
TALIESIN: Fuck no!

3660
04:18:21,902 --> 04:18:27,559
TRAVIS: Let's just have a conversation about this.
We're adults.

3661
04:18:27,559 --> 04:18:30,446
LAURA: What is this game, Matthew? Don't do it!

3662
04:18:30,446 --> 04:18:35,791
MATT: He is going to take a shot at Pike with a
Firebolt cantrip.

3663
04:18:35,791 --> 04:18:38,581
TALIESIN: You have a reaction.

3664
04:18:38,581 --> 04:18:41,377
SAM: I do, but I want to save it.

3665
04:18:41,377 --> 04:18:42,597
ASHLEY: Bob and weave. I can bob and weave.

3666
04:18:42,597 --> 04:18:44,998
TALIESIN: There's no save. This is it.

3667
04:18:44,998 --> 04:18:52,387
SAM: Do people have to be alive to get out of
here?

3668
04:18:52,387 --> 04:18:56,099
MATT: That is a 21. What's your armor class?

3669
04:18:56,099 --> 04:18:57,991
ASHLEY: 23.

3670
04:18:57,991 --> 04:19:00,135
TRAVIS: It doesn't even hit!

3671
04:19:00,135 --> 04:19:02,424
LIAM: Eat a dick!

3672
04:19:02,424 --> 04:19:05,401
ASHLEY: Eat a bag of dicks!

3673
04:19:05,401 --> 04:19:07,653
TRAVIS: At level five?

3674
04:19:07,653 --> 04:19:14,206
MATT: I rolled a five. It's a cantrip. It fires
the bolt towards you; you're barely holding on. As

3675
04:19:14,206 --> 04:19:22,910
you turn around, the flame hits you, but your
armor absorbs it. No impact. Okay.

3676
04:19:22,910 --> 04:19:25,545
LAURA: I need Taco Bell right now in my life!

3677
04:19:25,545 --> 04:19:30,039
ASHLEY: I know. I want Taco Bell so bad. We might
have cheats tonight.

3678
04:19:30,039 --> 04:19:34,043
MATT: That's the end of Scanlan's turn. Keyleth?

3679
04:19:34,043 --> 04:19:35,037
MARISHA: Are we all here?

3680
04:19:35,037 --> 04:19:35,796
TALIESIN: We're all here.

3681
04:19:35,796 --> 04:19:37,904
MARISHA: We're all sure about this? We're out?
100%?

3682
04:19:37,904 --> 04:19:39,236
TALIESIN: We're dying.

3683
04:19:39,236 --> 04:19:40,555
TRAVIS: No, let's stay and fight.

3684
04:19:40,555 --> 04:19:42,539
MARISHA: We're on this plane, right?

3685
04:19:42,539 --> 04:19:44,528
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're on the material plane.

3686
04:19:44,528 --> 04:19:48,511
MARISHA: Then we're going to the Feywild! And we
all hold hands--

3687
04:19:48,511 --> 04:19:51,227
MATT: Are you turning back to your form, then?

3688
04:19:51,227 --> 04:19:56,934
MARISHA: Yes, I drop form and I pull out my tuning
fork and my flowers, and I think deep about the

3689
04:19:56,934 --> 04:20:03,943
Gilded Run and the Shademirk Bog and the beautiful
pond that we appeared around, that we know there's

3690
04:20:03,943 --> 04:20:07,885
a portal right near it. That's what I think about
strongly, and I say,

3691
04:20:07,885 --> 04:20:09,721
everyone think about the pretty ponds!

3692
04:20:09,721 --> 04:20:11,888
LIAM: Feywild Spring Break, motherfuckers!

3693
04:20:11,888 --> 04:20:14,698
MARISHA: Spring Break 2017, Feywild!

3694
04:20:14,698 --> 04:20:18,767
TALIESIN: Roll. You're a good man.

3695
04:20:18,767 --> 04:20:24,560
MATT: Vecna's going to attempt to Counterspell.

3696
04:20:24,560 --> 04:20:27,780
SAM: Yep. 7th-level Counterspell against him.

3697
04:20:27,780 --> 04:20:32,649
(laughter)

3698
04:20:32,649 --> 04:20:35,083
TRAVIS: I knew that's what you were waiting for!

3699
04:20:35,083 --> 04:20:41,623
MATT: That was some old-school Magic: The
Gathering shit, right there.

3700
04:20:41,623 --> 04:20:45,143
LIAM: Do it, Scanlan. Do it.

3701
04:20:45,143 --> 04:20:47,134
ASHLEY: You just pulled out the wild Uno card.

3702
04:20:47,134 --> 04:20:50,184
(laughter)

3703
04:20:50,184 --> 04:20:51,687
TALIESIN: We're not happy yet.

3704
04:20:51,687 --> 04:21:02,229
MATT: So 7th-level Counterspell. Yeah, you don't
have to roll.

3705
04:21:02,229 --> 04:21:04,312
(cheering)

3706
04:21:04,312 --> 04:21:12,879
MATT: Yeah. Let me check real fast. I need to
confirm this real fast.

3707
04:21:12,879 --> 04:21:15,568
LAURA: Scanlan's back.

3708
04:21:15,568 --> 04:21:17,087
LIAM: Shorthalt's back.

3709
04:21:17,087 --> 04:21:20,274
TRAVIS: "I'd rather not use it."

3710
04:21:20,274 --> 04:21:28,385
MATT: Yeah, no. The only spell he even had left to
Counterspell was 7th level. Yeah, (poof).

3711
04:21:28,385 --> 04:21:30,402
SAM: Let's go.

3712
04:21:30,402 --> 04:21:38,414
MATT: As the glyph of shattering begins to
coalesce around his fingers in one hand and the

3713
04:21:38,414 --> 04:21:42,502
wrist on the other, you strike up a Counterspell
of your own.

3714
04:21:42,502 --> 04:21:51,453
SAM: Sure. I will say to him, this time-- I've got
nothing left. I will sing to him, (singing) I'm

3715
04:21:51,453 --> 04:22:08,209
beautiful. I'm beautiful, it's true. You saw my
face in a crowded place, and you didn't know what

3716
04:22:08,209 --> 04:22:12,114
to do because I just took a shit on you.

3717
04:22:12,114 --> 04:22:14,869
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

3718
04:22:14,869 --> 04:22:23,014
MATT: The last thing you hear as the spell begins
to take effect is the whispered voice of Vecna

3719
04:22:23,014 --> 04:22:27,824
throughout all of your heads say, "What?"

3720
04:22:27,824 --> 04:22:30,001
(laughter)

3721
04:22:30,001 --> 04:22:37,218
MATT: Before (spell noise) you are all yanked
through a familiar tunnel of darkness and then

3722
04:22:37,218 --> 04:22:46,262
thrust out into the center of a clustered, dense
forest in the Feywild.

3723
04:22:46,262 --> 04:22:49,437
SAM: Oh god. Have I been there? Wait, was that me?
Yes. Okay.

3724
04:22:49,437 --> 04:22:57,081
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I would have taken us home,
but we were already there, and I had to go

3725
04:22:57,081 --> 04:22:59,038
somewhere else.

3726
04:22:59,038 --> 04:23:00,455
LAURA: Where's Vax?

3727
04:23:00,455 --> 04:23:01,991
MATT: And that's where we're going to end.

3728
04:23:01,991 --> 04:23:04,275
(groaning)

3729
04:23:04,275 --> 04:23:13,281
LIAM: (fake crying) You sadistic motherfucker! You
cut it right there?! I was okay until right then!

3730
04:23:13,281 --> 04:23:16,279
TALIESIN: That's not nice.

3731
04:23:16,279 --> 04:23:19,836
MATT: I'm so sorry.

3732
04:23:19,836 --> 04:23:23,793
TALIESIN: Nothing feels good.

3733
04:23:23,793 --> 04:23:26,705
LIAM: I was okay until right then!

3734
04:23:26,705 --> 04:23:31,806
ASHLEY: Let's do one more hour.

3735
04:23:31,806 --> 04:23:40,655
TRAVIS: That was amazing. That was brutal. We
didn't have a fucking chance.

3736
04:23:40,655 --> 04:23:42,849
TALIESIN: No, there was not a fucking prayer.

3737
04:23:42,849 --> 04:23:49,795
LIAM: What else were we going to do? Set up an
Orange Julius stand by that tower? Of course we

3738
04:23:49,795 --> 04:23:51,526
were going to go into that tower.

3739
04:23:51,526 --> 04:23:55,365
TRAVIS: Of course! But we didn't know how fucked
we were until we got up there. We had to go.

3740
04:23:55,365 --> 04:23:59,115
MARISHA: I thought that we were pretty badass when
we took the tower down, and we were not.

3741
04:23:59,115 --> 04:24:01,503
ASHLEY: No.

3742
04:24:01,503 --> 04:24:06,661
MARISHA: I can get you back, man. I can get you
fucking back!

3743
04:24:06,661 --> 04:24:08,487
SAM: Can you? Without a body?

3744
04:24:08,487 --> 04:24:11,309
MATT: We're going to have some discussions.

3745
04:24:11,309 --> 04:24:13,368
SAM: Without a body?

3746
04:24:13,368 --> 04:24:16,834
MARISHA: But True Resurrection says I can.

3747
04:24:16,834 --> 04:24:26,470
MATT: Marisha. We'll have some discussions.
Anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching.

3748
04:24:26,470 --> 04:24:35,284
Thanks for kicking in for a taste of the final
arc. Holy shit.

3749
04:24:35,284 --> 04:24:38,865
TALIESIN: You know what, I'm grateful that we're
not--

3750
04:24:38,865 --> 04:24:47,884
MATT: Oh man. There was part of me, where either
they were going to end up waiting-- if that didn't

3751
04:24:47,884 --> 04:24:52,370
break concentration, they were either going to
wait for you and probably lose a lot more,

3752
04:24:52,370 --> 04:24:57,727
possibly Keyleth once she realized what was going
on. Or left without you.

3753
04:24:57,727 --> 04:24:59,404
You would have come back.

3754
04:24:59,404 --> 04:25:01,510
LAURA: And we would have been gone.

3755
04:25:01,510 --> 04:25:05,798
TRAVIS: And I would have to have won the game all by
myself.

3756
04:25:05,798 --> 04:25:07,849
SAM: Which you've already done.

3757
04:25:07,849 --> 04:25:12,767
TRAVIS: Or I would have taken the Deck and been
like--

3758
04:25:12,767 --> 04:25:22,750
LIAM: Number one lesson. The one takeaway tonight.
The one takeaway is just how OP Vax'ildan is.

3759
04:25:22,750 --> 04:25:26,044
(laughter)

3760
04:25:26,044 --> 04:25:27,325
MATT: This is true.

3761
04:25:27,325 --> 04:25:28,862
LAURA: If he can't move, he's fucked.

3762
04:25:28,862 --> 04:25:30,278
TRAVIS: Boots no longer.

3763
04:25:30,278 --> 04:25:33,181
MARISHA: I can't believe I fucking dumped my
9th-level spell in you, and then you got tied

3764
04:25:33,181 --> 04:25:35,489
down. It made zero fucking difference.

3765
04:25:35,489 --> 04:25:37,709
LIAM: You did great.

3766
04:25:37,709 --> 04:25:39,722
MARISHA: We both wasted our fucking 9th-level
spells.

3767
04:25:39,722 --> 04:25:42,183
SAM: They're hard to use. We've got to learn to
use them better.

3768
04:25:42,183 --> 04:25:45,307
LIAM: You've got one chance to do something
fucking amazing.

3769
04:25:45,307 --> 04:25:49,352
LAURA: Vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy.

3770
04:25:49,352 --> 04:25:52,426
MATT: We'll pick up on this next week.

3771
04:25:52,426 --> 04:25:54,820
SAM: Wow. I'm shaking.

3772
04:25:54,820 --> 04:26:01,548
MATT: Me, too. All right, guys. Thank you so much.
Have a wonderful night. We'll see you soon, and is

3773
04:26:01,548 --> 04:26:02,953
it Thursday yet?

3774
04:26:02,953 --> 04:26:04,681
TRAVIS: Nope! It's Thursday right now!

3775
04:26:04,681 --> 04:26:06,134
LIAM: Last Thursday.

3776
04:26:06,134 --> 04:26:07,233
MATT: Good night, guys.

3777
04:26:07,233 --> 04:32:19,641
