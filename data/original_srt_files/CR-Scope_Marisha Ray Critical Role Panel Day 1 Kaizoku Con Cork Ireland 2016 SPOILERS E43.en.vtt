NOTE Paragraph

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:09.582
MARISHA: I felt like I should have an epic
entrance and go get the chair. Hi guys. How's it

00:00:09.582 --> 00:00:24.962
going? I'm just going to sit. It's more casual,
more comfortable. Hi everybody! How's it going?

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:34.073
Good? Everyone having fun? I am Marisha Ray, for
anyone that doesn't know me. I'm a voice actor, an

00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:40.493
actress, a host, producer, writer, and I'm on Geek
&amp; Sundry's Critical Role.

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:45.632
(cheering)

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:52.614
MARISHA: This is my panel, "How To Kick Ass and
Take Names," which is basically me talking about

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:58.653
myself, which is always awkward and weird, so I
generally open it up to questions pretty early on,

00:00:58.653 --> 00:01:08.312
and we just chat! We just talk about things. Yeah,
a few of the things I've done: you can hear me in

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:15.223
games like Star Wars Battlefront, Metal Gear
Solid: Phantom Pain, Persona as Margaret,

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:18.991
and most recently Fire Emblem: Fates!

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.831
(cheering)

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:29.194
MARISHA: As Mikoto, Oboro and Effie. You can see
me in shows like Super Power Beat Down, which is

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:37.973
super fun, and Batgirl: Spoiled, and, yeah, that's
enough about me. That's fine. You can just look up

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:48.093
the rest. I do a little bit of everything.
Everything from stunt work, to writing and

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:58.282
producing. In Los Angeles, that's what we call
surviving. You can't say no to jobs, so if someone

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:03.862
is like, "Hey can you grip?", you're just like,
"Ha! It's cool, Hey, man, what the shit is that?

00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:09.360
"Google it real fast, okay, just mainly got to set
up lights. No idea how to light things, all

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:19.536
"right." That's how you learn things. Experience is
key. You always learn more with experience. I

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:28.751
moved to Los Angeles when I was 18, like a crazy
person, and ate a lot of ramen, and suffered on

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:35.662
public transportation. Homeless people smell
really bad sometimes. I did crazy stuff. I've done

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:40.047
crazy things. I've got a lot of stories. Why don't
we ask questions? Because questions are fun,

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:46.131
although I'm sitting up here rambling. By the way,
having a Creeper right in front is really

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:53.500
unnerving. It's like jack-in-a-box. 
It can happen any moment!

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.211
Okay, has anyone got any questions? Yeah?

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.971
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What was it like to work on MGS?

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:04.791
MARISHA: On Metal Gear Solid? Metal Gear Solid was
amazing and actually I am a massive Metal Gear

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:12.763
fan. When I found out I got that one I was like
(excited noises). Going into the booth every day

00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:22.371
was like (excited noises). It was phenomenal. You
can actually recruit me and play with me.

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:28.811
(laughter) That was even more fun, I'm playable.
What was that?

00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.469
AUDIENCE MEMBER: That sounds pretty weird that I
can play with you.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:37.361
MARISHA: Yeah, you can play with me. You can shoot
me or play with me. It's like the American dichotomy.

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.527
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:49.292
MARISHA: Yeah, pick one. Good line. That one was
funny because the director on that one, Kris

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:57.170
Zimmerman, is incredible, she's directed a ton of
video games and is a good friend of Matt and I's.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.482
There were a few times where lines would come out,
that a director and voiceover are there to give

00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:07.840
you context because you don't have a full script.
It's not like continuous screenplay, like a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.622
theater or on camera. So you're generally just
getting your lines. The director is there to

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:23.920
provide context, and some Metal Gear Solid lines,
out of context, are really fucking weird. It came

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:34.561
up where-- she's like, "Okay, so the character,
Solid Snake." I'm like, "Uh-huh." She's like, "He

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:42.051
"does this thing where he hides in cardboard boxes,
and he--", and I'm like, "All right, I got it, I

00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:49.591
"got it. It's great. Oh my god, I'm so excited." It
was probably still one of my favorite experiences

00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.533
that I've worked on to date because I'm such a
fangirl.

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.660
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Did you feel like you connected
with the character?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:06.290
MARISHA: Soldier Number One, super connected,
Soldier Number One. Yeah, soldier battle shouty

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:16.332
stuff. It’s kind of Snake. Snake is the main
character there. (laughter) Most of it is

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:23.419
soldiers. So, sure. Do we have another question?

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.449
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who would win, Batman or
Superman?

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.758
(laughter)

00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:29.748
MARISHA: Wait, what?

00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:33.139
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who would win in a fight, Batman
or Superman?

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.717
MARISHA: I mean, aren’t they coming out with a
movie about that?

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:40.260
(laughter)

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.520
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.617
MARSHA: Yeah, Batman vs Superman, and yes they
are! Ben Affleck.

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:50.037
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, he’s cute. No, seriously, who
would win?

00:05:51.148 --> 00:05:52.718
MARISHA: I’m a Batman fan.

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.996
(cheering)

00:05:54.996 --> 00:06:00.908
MARISHA: How about this? Batman wins because of
character development and story arc. How’s that?

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:06.878
I like my flawed characters. I’ll take them.

00:06:06.878 --> 00:06:08.167
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He’s a broken child.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:08.850
MARISHA: What was that?

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.038
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He’s a broken child.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:14.228
MARISHA: Well, wouldn’t you be if you saw your
parents get shot when you were a child?

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:15.918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:26.979
MARISHA: <i>No?</i> Wait, <i>no?</i> I’m going to go out on
a limb here and say I don’t believe that.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:32.357
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, I’d be <i>sad,</i> but I’d wake
up the next day and I’d have all of that money.

00:06:32.357 --> 00:06:36.417
(laughs) It’s a silver lining.

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.548
MARISHA: What’s your name?

00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:41.358
AUDIENCE MEMBER: John Dunn.

00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:48.968
MARISHA: Ladies, if you’re looking for a man who
knows where his priorities lie, John Dunn is back

00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:56.158
there at the go. Next question, yes?

00:06:56.158 --> 00:07:00.780
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Are you planning on doing any
other Super Power Beat Downs with Nightwing?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.238
MARISHA: What’s that? Super Power Beat Down,
something about Nightwing?

00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:06.268
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Are you planning on doing another
one?

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:12.948
MARISHA: Oh, are we planning to make another with
Nightwing? Because we have one with Nightwing.

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:18.109
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:23.747
MARISHA: Yeah, we're always doing more Super Power
Beat Down. The problem with Super Power Beat Down

00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:29.789
is that the visual effects in it are pretty
extensive. It's just one guy because we're still

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:36.288
making a web series with very little money. Yes,
it's insane. His name is Nikolai. He's actually

00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:47.098
based out of Ukraine, which is even more awesome.
There's no way we could be anything like a weekly

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:55.388
show or anything like that because the effects and
the shoots that we are doing are so extensive. The

00:07:55.388 --> 00:08:02.848
combat, the stunt work, and so much post goes into
it. A ton of people are always like, "(whiny

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:07.887
"voice) Why is it taking so long for Super Power
Beat Down?" and I'm like, "Shut up and enjoy your

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:15.449
"free content!" Yeah, that's why they take some
time, but they're worth it, right? They're totally

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:19.257
worth it because they're pretty stellar at the
end. For anyone who's not familiar with Super

00:08:19.257 --> 00:08:32.718
Power Beat Down is a show that I host with Damian
Beurer on Machinima, and we take two superheroes

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:42.658
generally from different universes across fandom,
Marvel vs DC type of a thing, and put them in a

00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:49.909
fight and see who wins and the audience votes to
see who decides. What we always do is we always

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:59.248
shoot both endings and then whatever the audience
decides is what goes in. I mean, sometimes I'm

00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:05.179
like, "I disagree, but all right, sure, that's
what they want to see." Sometimes it's more of a

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:12.659
popularity contest, not going to lie, but I will
say the <i>comments</i> on Super Power Beat Down are

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:22.128
phenomenal because it's like anger, nerd rage
"Ugh! Wolverine would totally shoot Spawn because

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:29.558
"regeneration powers would totally, ugh!" It's just
brilliant, the anger because of these fictional

00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:33.908
battles. It's phenomenal. Good one.

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:36.198
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:37.140
MARISHA: What's that?

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.357
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:09:42.357 --> 00:09:45.448
MARISHA: We do sometimes. I think it depends.

00:09:45.448 --> 00:09:47.780
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:54.838
MARISHA: When they’re close, we will because if
it's not close then-- it's more of a special thing

00:09:54.838 --> 00:10:04.408
that we tend to do, because I feel like if we
released the alternate ending for all of them it

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:09.498
would ruin the point of the show if we did it
<i>all</i> the time. It would be like, “Oh well this is

00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:19.330
"more of a Choose Your Own Adventure than an actual
debate.” They take work. If we release the

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:25.548
alternate ending, it means we have to put post
work into that alternate ending. We'll shoot it

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:33.948
and wait to see who wins. Some of them, they're
not finished, so we don't use it because it takes

00:10:33.948 --> 00:10:44.778
a lot of time. Seeing Deadpool explode, for that
half a second shot of him exploding, that's a

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:51.437
couple weeks of computer, you know? It's different
when it's Marvel and Disney and they have

00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:58.098
multi-million dollars and then they're still
hiring ILM, and all these other studios to do

00:10:58.098 --> 00:11:04.649
certain effects. That's why you see the credits at
the end of Avengers, it's like eight different

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:12.399
special effects houses because it takes a lot.
Next question?

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:21.358
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:11:21.358 --> 00:11:32.817
MARISHA: You’re a champion. My savior. (laughs)
Sabat. I love him. What kind of hijinks do we get

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:43.549
into with other voice actors? Well, before it was
public, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. For those who weren't

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:51.328
aware, Critical Role was our personal game for
about two years before we started the show. We

00:11:51.328 --> 00:11:59.938
were legit doing it because we really enjoyed it.
Why it works now and why it's so great, because

00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:07.018
the dynamics were already established. I mean, we
do so much crazy stuff, and it is like a small

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:11.488
industry once you're in it so we know like half
the people. You'll have to ask Matt when he gets

00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:18.679
up here next. A few years ago for his birthday, we
threw an HP Lovecraft murder mystery birthday

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:26.259
party and gave everybody characters and it was
like a four hour puzzle escape room, it was like a

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:32.243
real life Mansions of Madness or like a real life
Arkham Horror, for those who know. It was

00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:37.807
phenomenal, but we commit 100 percent. We're like
no, you have to be in costume, and “We’re there.

00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:47.229
"Totally.” The Ren Faire is always a blast, but
because we're actors and we're all super nerdy,

00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:54.600
going to Ren Faire we get in full costume and then
we pick characters and talk in British accents the

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:02.808
whole time and get drunk off mead. It's crazy,
it's late, it's nuts. It's a fun life.

00:13:02.808 --> 00:13:05.839
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:13.128
MARISHA: Nope! That's like walking into a trap.
Maybe after a few drinks. (laughs)

00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:16.138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:13:16.138 --> 00:13:21.058
MARISHA: (laughs) Next question.

00:13:21.058 --> 00:13:31.918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What is the job that was the
funnest or most unusual?

00:13:35.097 --> 00:13:46.466
MARISHA: The most unusual or the funnest random
jobs kind of a thing? Like a random job, stumble

00:13:46.466 --> 00:14:02.558
into sort of thing? AD can actually be fun, if you
are an AD you are essentially the on-set dick that

00:14:02.558 --> 00:14:09.998
moves everyone and keeps everyone on task. So
sometimes most ADs on set we were like, "Ugh,

00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:15.622
"fucking asshole," and like honestly people are
like, "That guy's a fucking asshole" because he's

00:14:15.622 --> 00:14:22.749
doing his job. You can be still a fun AD and it is
your job to be like, "Ha ha ha, that was fun,

00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:27.459
"right? That was fun, but okay seriously we have to
get this shot in the next three minutes so stop

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:38.618
"joking now and shoot." It can be really fun but
also really hectic because the AD essentially does

00:14:38.618 --> 00:14:46.619
everything that the director can't do at the time,
so honestly the ADs are the real on-set heroes

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:55.620
and, yes, way more like a stage director. Exactly.
They're orchestrating the whole thing. Because the

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:04.548
director's job is to sit back behind the camera
and talk to the actors. It’s his vision that he’s

00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:09.978
trying capture. If the director needs actors on
set, you’re the one who’s screaming, you're the

00:15:09.978 --> 00:15:15.757
one screaming, “Quiet on set!” You’re the one
doing everything else that everyone else’s job can

00:15:15.757 --> 00:15:28.947
fall on is the job of the AD. It’s a blast. I
really enjoy it. Most unusual job? Oh man. My

00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:34.486
first, no, that’s not true. My first real job in
Los Angeles, I was canvassing for the Democratic

00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:43.968
National Committee. My second was street
performer. So that was fun. I’ve got stories. I

00:15:43.968 --> 00:15:51.468
could probably write a book. You see a lot when
you’re standing on the street. Yeah. I’ll end that

00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:55.579
there. Yes, in the back!

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:59.259
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you ever get tempted to look
at Matthew’s notes before a game?

00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:06.488
MARISHA: Do I ever get tempted to look at Matt’s
notes before a game? No, and I’m pretty sure if I

00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:15.349
did, I wouldn’t be living any more. You’d find my
body somewhere. And no, because that’s cheating.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:24.808
It’s like peeking before Christmas. But, no. That
is actually the thing I get questioned and accused

00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:30.478
of the most is, “Oh, you know, she’s dating the
DM, so she’s got to know everything." I’m like,

00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:39.098
“No, I actually really try hard to shield my eyes
through the house as he’s working on things.” So

00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:44.997
yeah. No, because that’s part of the game. It’s
way more fun to be in the moment and immersed and

00:16:44.997 --> 00:16:49.936
as surprised when everyone else is. Yeah!

00:16:49.936 --> 00:16:55.017
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:16:55.017 --> 00:17:00.789
MARISHA: Advice for an aspiring voice actor.
First, become an actor. You have take acting

00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:10.817
classes. Legit acting classes. Theater. Improv is
also very helpful. Take acting classes because

00:17:10.817 --> 00:17:17.110
that’s where you get the technique. Like in dance,
when they always make you take ballet because

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.749
that’s where you get technique, that’s where you
get your form. Also, I think voice acting is just

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:30.998
a subdivision of acting, of performing. Acting
classes, acting classes, acting classes. Also,

00:17:30.998 --> 00:17:38.688
start recording yourself and listening to yourself
a lot because listening to your own voice is going

00:17:38.688 --> 00:17:44.168
to throw you a very long time. Eventually, when
you start getting in booths, they put headsets on

00:17:44.168 --> 00:17:52.658
you and you’re hearing yourself as you’re talking
and actually performing. There’s a lot of newbies

00:17:52.658 --> 00:17:57.527
that get in the booth for the first time and start
hearing themselves. Because everyone hates how

00:17:57.527 --> 00:18:03.278
they sound. Every voice actor fucking hates their
voice, by the way. Just throwing that out there.

00:18:03.278 --> 00:18:09.557
You never get used to it, but you kind of have to,
so you start listening to yourself. My other

00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:19.108
advice would be to not limit yourself. Say, “I
want to be a voice actor,” that’s like being like,

00:18:19.108 --> 00:18:29.850
“I’m going to be a charcoal sketch artist. I don’t
want to touch any other mediums. I just only ever

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:36.468
"want to work in charcoal.” It’s fine if charcoal’s
your forte, but most other visual artists will

00:18:36.468 --> 00:18:41.718
probably stretch their legs and try other things,
and you should, too. Just like visual art

00:18:41.718 --> 00:18:54.008
medium, improv, oral speech, accent training,
theater, all of that will only help strengthen

00:18:54.008 --> 00:19:00.978
your voice acting. It’s training in all mediums.
Don’t limit yourself because you never know, you

00:19:00.978 --> 00:19:08.137
might work really hard, get to voice acting and be
like, “Eh. I think a like black box theater

00:19:08.137 --> 00:19:17.850
"better.” And that’s great! That’s fine. Think of
it more as an arc. It’s acting, it’s not just

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:26.298
voice acting. Never limit yourself. Yeah. Does
that answer that? Does that help a little bit?

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:29.538
Yeah. Next question.

00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:33.020
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who’s your archenemy?

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:39.429
MARISHA: Who’s my archenemy?! In real life or in
my imaginary one?

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.828
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Both!

00:19:45.368 --> 00:19:54.579
MARISHA: My archenemy in real life is probably
myself, my own self-loathing and insecurities that

00:19:54.579 --> 00:20:01.500
I deal with all the time because it takes a lot of
energy to hate other people, man. It takes a lot.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:11.879
So I wouldn’t say I had any archenemies. There are
people that I’m like, "Eh, no, your negative

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:20.663
"energy, I don’t like it, good,” so I don’t. I try
not to obsess. I feel like hating someone takes a

00:20:20.663 --> 00:20:32.748
lot of meditation on negative energy. In my
imaginary life? Same answer. Does that kind of

00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:41.267
answer your question? He's like, "I'm not
satisfied, but sure. Not really, but I guess."

00:20:41.758 --> 00:20:47.377
Okay, next question. You. Yes, you. You raised
your hand.

00:20:47.377 --> 00:20:53.887
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:20:53.887 --> 00:21:11.338
MARISHA: I was, actually. Hang on one second. I
put on like eight layers. It's good. What was the

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:19.718
question? Oh, was I a nerd? Yes, I was actually. I
was a huge video game nerd and a comic book nerd

00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:27.307
as well, I was a DC girl for a really long time.
Yeah, my first system was an NES when I started

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:35.798
playing video games when I was three. Favorite
system was probably OG PlayStation. Favorite video

00:21:35.798 --> 00:21:39.759
game of all time and the game that's probably
responsible for making me like a core gamer to

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:47.602
this day was Tomb Raider. I fucking love that
game, Tomb 2 was amazing. Yeah, and I actually had

00:21:47.602 --> 00:21:54.238
no idea-- When I came to Los Angeles I wasn't
pursuing voice acting or hosting in a video game

00:21:54.238 --> 00:22:04.636
universe or nerd geekdom culture stuff at all. I
went to college for acting, moved to LA and was

00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:12.918
auditioning and doing the grind, hitting the
pavement, sending in headshots, and after about a

00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:20.505
year of that and not really making any headway, I
was like, "This is stupid, this is lame because

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:27.568
"nothing is happening," so I joined an improv
class. Just because. I still try to keep going to

00:22:27.568 --> 00:22:39.529
classes to better yourself. So I joined an improv
class and there I met a girl who worked for a

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:44.847
company called [inaudible] Online as well as a few
other companies, and she was also did video game

00:22:44.847 --> 00:22:52.428
journalism on her spare time and was a cosplayer,
loved cosplaying, and I overheard her in an improv

00:22:52.428 --> 00:22:59.056
class one day. I hadn't met her beforehand, and I
was like, "Are you talking about a video game?"

00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:02.916
She was like, "Yeah!" I don't know, she was
talking about something specific at the time, I

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:05.048
don't know, it was like, "Wait, are you talking
about Assassin's Creed?" and she was like, "Oh my

00:23:05.048 --> 00:23:10.142
"god, yes." Something like that, and then I went
and I sat next to her and then from there she was

00:23:10.142 --> 00:23:14.998
like, "Hey, do you want to write for my site? You
don't really get paid, but you might get free

00:23:14.998 --> 00:23:21.948
"promo copies for video games every once and
awhile." I was like, "Oh my god, yes. Free video

00:23:21.948 --> 00:23:29.078
"games, heck yeah!" By the way, that I don't think
that ever happened, because like they rarely do

00:23:29.078 --> 00:23:36.017
that. They're assholes about that sometimes, video
game companies. So that was a false promise. But

00:23:36.017 --> 00:23:43.408
from there, I started doing on-camera hosting work
with her, and then I met other nerds and we just

00:23:43.408 --> 00:23:52.877
started shooting nerd-based sketches. It slowly
became an amalgam of these two things that I loved

00:23:52.877 --> 00:24:03.437
and that was awesome. Like I said, I didn't really
try it, I just followed what I was enjoying, to be

00:24:03.437 --> 00:24:08.688
totally honest. Like I said, I started writing for
her for free because I thought I was going to get

00:24:08.688 --> 00:24:16.856
free games, and then one thing led to another and
I started hosting because they were like, "You

00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:22.398
"know about video games <i>and</i> you can talk into a
microphone. People can understand you. That's

00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:29.127
"great. Will you get on camera?" I was like, "I
don't know." I had no idea what I was doing, I had

00:24:29.127 --> 00:24:35.258
no idea. Then I just started meeting people and
working the video game press side of things. I

00:24:35.258 --> 00:24:41.268
started meeting a ton of voice actors and
directors and one thing really just led to

00:24:41.268 --> 00:24:49.728
another. Once you fall into a crowd and start
meeting everyone in that adjacent crowd-- once you

00:24:49.728 --> 00:24:56.019
find your flock, it's all about finding your
flock. I was probably in LA for two years with

00:24:56.019 --> 00:25:02.849
just nothing, starving, working on the streets,
literally. Not as a prostitute.

00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:04.568
(laughter)

00:25:04.568 --> 00:25:11.148
MARISHA: ...but almost; as a street performer,
begging for tips. I wasn't begging. I never

00:25:11.148 --> 00:25:22.280
begged. It was crazy. I literally kept being like,
"Yeah, you want me to be Princess Leia in your

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:32.988
"sketch? Sure, I mean, that's fine. I'll do it for
free.” Never turn down free work, I will say that.

00:25:32.988 --> 00:25:39.928
Know your worth. There's a difference. Know your
worth, but I will still do free projects if I

00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:46.908
think it's going to be fun and enjoyable.
Sometimes those projects, those indie projects

00:25:46.908 --> 00:25:54.600
that they can't pay you for, are ones where
they'll let you take more extreme choices as an

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.698
artist. They're willing to let you play a little
bit more and those can be very fulfilling, and you

00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:08.634
never know who's watching. Plus, you never know
who that guy is going to be in ten years. I

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:15.069
actually had an amazing moment when we were at
Wizard World in Portland these past couple

00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:26.018
weekends; Critical Role was there. It was a
convention in Portland. A bunch of guys, some

00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:34.678
gaming guys, were there and I did shitty YouTube
videos and we were scum together. We were internet

00:26:34.678 --> 00:26:42.110
scum. They were up on stage with a panel and had a
huge line and we were up on stage with Critical

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:49.898
Role and I saw them later and was like, "Guys! Hey
guys, I'm so proud of you, because remember when

00:26:49.898 --> 00:26:54.947
"we were all garbage? When we were all nobodies and
we were all struggling?" and they were like,

00:26:54.947 --> 00:27:00.137
"Dude, we were literally just talking about that
when you guys were on your panel." I'm like,

00:27:00.137 --> 00:27:07.018
"Yeah!" It's a hierarchy. As long as you keep
working with people who are busting your ass,

00:27:07.018 --> 00:27:13.697
hopefully you all start getting elevated together.
Luckily we've hit that point and we're all the

00:27:13.697 --> 00:27:21.429
friends that I did shitty YouTube videos with
five, six years ago, and they kept busting their

00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:29.336
ass and now it slowly pays off. But yeah, it's a
struggle. Sorry, that was a bit of a tangent. But,

00:27:29.336 --> 00:27:38.671
yes. Or no. I don't remember your original
question. Yeah! Okay, next question. That was a

00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:45.117
good question, though. Yeah, you. Have you already
asked a question? No, okay, go ahead.

00:27:45.117 --> 00:27:52.227
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:27:52.227 --> 00:28:01.679
MARISHA: Good question. I do have some in mind. I
have a few ideas. None of us-- we get asked this

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:14.269
question a lot and none of us really want to say
anything in case we all inevitably die. We still

00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:25.357
want it to be a surprise, but I will say I might
have a bard lined up, maybe. I also have a cleric,

00:28:25.357 --> 00:28:33.558
which is pretty fun. I've got options. Yes, you.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:40.238
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a very quick question. The
bird's name is Dagon.

00:28:40.238 --> 00:28:41.710
MARISHA: Dagon, yep.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.118
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is that a Lovecraft reference?

00:28:43.118 --> 00:28:45.778
MARISHA: Yes it is. Ding ding ding!

00:28:45.778 --> 00:28:48.987
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Okay, just making sure because
that is not a common name at all.

00:28:48.987 --> 00:28:56.897
MARISHA: Yep, we named our bird after Dagon, the
Old God of the Deep Ones.

00:28:56.897 --> 00:29:02.568
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Follow up, do you have any
favorite Lovecraft stories?

00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:07.489
MARISHA: Do I have any favorite Lovecraft stories?
I actually really love The Dunwich Horror short

00:29:07.489 --> 00:29:18.429
story. Of course, The Call of Cthulhu is classic,
great. (nerdy voice) A must-read if, I say so

00:29:18.429 --> 00:29:31.047
myself. I really like Dunwich Horror, that cult in
Louisiana, with lots of bigotry in some of the

00:29:31.047 --> 00:29:38.117
stories, but it's great! Not that I'm condoning
bigotry, by the way, or saying that I like

00:29:38.117 --> 00:29:41.417
bigotry, because that's not true.

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:43.798
Yeah, fedora.

00:29:43.798 --> 00:29:48.513
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who are your biggest role models
[inaudible]?

00:29:48.513 --> 00:30:03.023
MARISHA: Some of my biggest fror my performing
point of view... Ironically, Vin Diesel.

00:30:03.023 --> 00:30:07.823
Meeting him was incredible and we did
D&amp;Diesel, if anyone has seen that through Geek &amp;

00:30:07.823 --> 00:30:13.334
Sundry. We played with a couple of people from
Critical Role and Matt got the amazing joy of

00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:24.273
dungeon mastering for Vin Diesel. I was actually a
big fan of him for a while, and really admired

00:30:24.273 --> 00:30:32.444
him, because he moved to Los Angeles, failed, had
to move back to New York, moved to Los Angeles

00:30:32.444 --> 00:30:42.463
again, failed, had to move back to New York. So he
wrote, directed, and produced, and starred in his

00:30:42.463 --> 00:30:52.455
own short film. It got accepted into Sundance,
Steven Spielberg noticed him, and then put him in

00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:59.994
Saving Private Ryan. So if you ever go back and
watch Saving Private Ryan, you see he dies pretty

00:30:59.994 --> 00:31:03.493
early on. Spoiler alert! It’s a 20 year old
movie!

00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:06.305
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You can’t just do that!

00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:18.843
MARISHA: (laughter) Yeah, and that was his first
major role. I knew early on that he was a huge D&amp;D

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:26.854
nerd, and took a lot of cues from fantasy and from
Dungeons &amp; Dragons and later he was like, "Oh

00:31:26.854 --> 00:31:32.313
"yeah, I’m totally bisexual.” I’m like, "Dude,
you’re fucking dope as shit! You’re the coolest

00:31:32.313 --> 00:31:40.892
"person on this world!” I don’t know, he was just
awesome, and I really admired his story, and I

00:31:40.892 --> 00:31:47.592
like people who are self-made. Hearing his story
was-- Because I started writing and shooting my

00:31:47.592 --> 00:31:54.083
own web series when I was staying in Los Angeles
for a year and a half and nothing was happening. I

00:31:54.083 --> 00:32:02.380
was like, “Fine, I’ll just start making stuff on
my own,” and I did. It made all the difference in

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:10.245
the world, because as soon as people see that
you’re putting in effort towards your own career,

00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:19.823
and you’re at least trying, that’s what people
notice and that’s what people like. So don’t be

00:32:19.823 --> 00:32:27.084
afraid to do that. Part of the reason why I did
Batgirl: Spoiled is because I was starting to get

00:32:27.084 --> 00:32:37.012
typecast really fast. As like, (Valley girl voice)
ditzy girl next door, middle America, a little

00:32:37.012 --> 00:32:45.804
vapid and I was like, “Ugh, this is dumb.” My
agent kept sending me out for cheerleader and I

00:32:45.804 --> 00:32:58.693
was like, "No!” I had a background in some martial
arts and wanted to do more action-y, gritty stuff.

00:32:58.693 --> 00:33:10.694
I was like, “I can do this,” but no one could see
it. Casting directors are the least imaginative

00:33:10.694 --> 00:33:19.343
people in the industry, which is the worst place
for that flaw to be. Casting directors, I find,

00:33:19.343 --> 00:33:28.213
can’t see past your eight by ten, your headshot.
So I had a hard time getting past this, they were

00:33:28.213 --> 00:33:37.104
like, “No, we don’t see action star, we don’t see
gritty heroin addict. You can’t do any of that.”

00:33:37.104 --> 00:33:45.352
I’m like, “No, that’s not true,” so I went, “Fuck
it, I’ll do it myself,” and got a team together

00:33:45.352 --> 00:33:52.623
and we started producing Batgirl: Spoiled. Got a
cease and desist after two episodes, <i>but</i> that

00:33:52.623 --> 00:34:02.214
opened up so many doors in my career. Actually now
people associate me more as being more action-y,

00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:11.763
superhero-type persona girl, instead of the ditzy
girl next door thing that I was getting stuck in

00:34:11.763 --> 00:34:19.963
for a while. It’s amazing what a photograph can do
to your image. It’s amazing what you can do with a

00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:31.892
little bit of makeup, changing your look a little
bit. People believe what they see in front of them

00:34:31.892 --> 00:34:41.252
and sometimes you have to show them. So if you
want to go out for a nerdy character, and you

00:34:41.252 --> 00:34:47.013
don’t really look the part, put on some glasses
and hold a manga and take a picture and send that

00:34:47.013 --> 00:34:54.473
instead of your plain, generic eight by ten and I
guarantee you’ll see way more results. Or send

00:34:54.473 --> 00:35:03.123
both! I started doing that, too, “Here’s a picture
of me in the short film where I played a heroin addict.”

00:35:03.123 --> 00:35:11.173
Yeah, crazy how wrecked I can look,
right? Here’s my eight by ten. It started changing

00:35:11.173 --> 00:35:16.802
everything. Just start breaking rules, because
they say, “You need an eight by ten. You need a

00:35:16.802 --> 00:35:25.215
"commercial where you’re smiling, and you need a
theatrical where you’re just-- Those are the two

00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:32.214
"looks, that’s what we need. We want you to be a
blank slate.” Walk in, “I’m a blank slate. You can

00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:40.584
"do anything--” No. No one can see it. People don’t
like to work to imagine things anymore. So

00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:45.113
sometimes you’ve got to throw it in their face,
and don’t be afraid to. Wow, that was another

00:35:45.113 --> 00:35:49.044
tangent, wasn’t it? Okay, next. Yeah? What?

00:35:49.044 --> 00:35:50.056
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:58.434
MARISHA: Thank you, good question! Another
question? Yes? What?

00:35:58.434 --> 00:36:09.273
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:36:09.273 --> 00:36:15.593
MARISHA: You mean in terms of their beliefs in
Civil War?

00:36:15.593 --> 00:36:18.464
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Which team would you be on?

00:36:18.464 --> 00:36:20.165
MARISHA: I’d be team Iron Man.

00:36:20.165 --> 00:36:26.892
(cheering)

00:36:26.892 --> 00:36:35.674
MARISHA: Captain’s a bit of a boy scout. It’s
tough. Iron Man all the way. What’s that?

00:36:35.674 --> 00:36:40.013
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:36:40.013 --> 00:36:42.874
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who needs superpowers when you’ve
got money?

00:36:42.874 --> 00:36:44.353
MARISHA: Wait, what’s that? What superhero?

00:36:44.353 --> 00:36:46.444
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who needs superpowers when you’ve
got money?

00:36:46.444 --> 00:36:49.623
MARISHA: What superpowers would I have?

00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:51.163
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who need superpowers--

00:36:51.163 --> 00:36:56.214
MARISHA: Oh! Who needs superpowers when you’ve got
money? Word. Yeah, Iron Man and Batman teaching

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:06.083
that lesson left and right. Okay, next question.
Yes?

00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:17.572
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:37:17.572 --> 00:37:32.124
MARISHA: Keyleth is very inexperienced. Keyleth is
still trying to figure out who she is. She’s never

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:43.954
even-- Kashaw-- This is Critical Role talk by the
way, if everyone’s not caught up, spoilers? Sorry.

00:37:43.954 --> 00:37:49.354
You won’t remember this when you catch up anyway,
it’s fine. They’re going to drink tonight. Don’t

00:37:49.354 --> 00:37:57.963
lie. She’s still trying to figure out who she is,
she doesn’t know, maybe. To be honest, I don’t

00:37:57.963 --> 00:38:08.142
know yet. I’m learning with Keyleth. Kashaw was
her first kiss, because she’s been stuck in the

00:38:08.142 --> 00:38:16.923
mountains her whole life. This is her first soirée
unto the world. She’s still figuring out herself

00:38:16.923 --> 00:38:24.734
and I think she’s going to have to do that before
she can really start pursuing interests in other

00:38:24.734 --> 00:38:33.183
people, which is why the whole Vax/Keyleth thing
has been tough. She has these feelings that are

00:38:33.183 --> 00:38:39.283
new to her and she doesn’t understand what they
are. Ever been in love for the first time?

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:44.432
Remember when you were like, "Is this love? Maybe
it’s not. What does this mean?” Then you dump him

00:38:44.432 --> 00:38:50.074
two weeks later and you’re like, "Fuck that guy,
that wasn’t love!” You don’t know! Then the next

00:38:50.074 --> 00:38:54.332
guy you’re like, "Wait, is this it? Oh god!” Then
he breaks your heart and you’re like, (sobbing)

00:38:54.493 --> 00:39:06.294
“That’s love!” She doesn’t know. She has no clue
yet, and I don’t either. The crazy thing with

00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:18.763
Keyleth and Dungeons &amp; Dragons is it’s like we’ve
been playing a three-year long long-form improv.

00:39:18.763 --> 00:39:22.033
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:31.124
MARISHA: Oh a hundred percent, yeah. Amazing book
I recommend called Me, Myself and Why by Jennifer

00:39:31.124 --> 00:39:40.482
Ouellette. It’s a life science book on the science
of yourself. You can’t say it’s a self-help book,

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:46.550
but it’s the first book I’ve read that made me not
feel like a freak of nature, because everyone

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:51.263
feels that way. Everyone’s like, “Ugh, these weird
mannerisms, and I’ve got this weird thing I do

00:39:51.263 --> 00:39:55.892
when I go home and I can’t tell anybody about it
because it’s <i>shame.</i>” Everyone has

00:39:55.892 --> 00:39:58.762
weird things about them.

00:39:58.762 --> 00:40:04.863
Then you read Me, Myself, and Why and
you're like, "Oh, it's genetic. Oh, everyone's a

00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:15.822
"freak of nature! Great. Awesome." It's a great
book. In the book, she goes into everything from

00:40:15.822 --> 00:40:26.632
the science of being a lightweight, to sexuality,
to tastebud mutation, to if there actually is a

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:34.792
soul-- physical or metaphysical. She also goes
into avatars, like in World of Warcraft or Second

00:40:34.792 --> 00:40:41.794
Life or RPGs. She has a section where she's
talking about what is happening in your brain when

00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:50.223
you play RPGs, or when you have an avatar. One of
the things that she talks about is when they go

00:40:50.223 --> 00:40:56.285
back, and when people tell stories, and they put
them in a EEG machine, or put them through an MRI

00:40:56.285 --> 00:41:05.386
and they're doing brain scans, and they start to
tell stories about when they were this avatar--

00:41:05.386 --> 00:41:11.213
when they were this other person-- and the
memories register in the exact same part of the

00:41:11.213 --> 00:41:18.883
brain and in the exact same way your memories do
in real life. They're all stored in the same part

00:41:18.883 --> 00:41:29.503
of your brain. At the end of the day, all we have
are our memories. So, if our memories when we're

00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:36.993
not real people versus our memories from real life
are essentially the same-- I know, right? Mind

00:41:36.993 --> 00:41:47.494
blowing. We'll talk as a group-- the Critical Role
group-- and if you have played in any D&amp;D campaign

00:41:47.494 --> 00:41:51.873
that you've been playing-- If anyone's not playing
D&amp;D or has never played a roleplaying game, highly

00:41:51.873 --> 00:42:01.565
recommend it. It's incredibly fulfilling, and you
learn a lot about yourself. It's an amazing thing

00:42:01.565 --> 00:42:07.143
that you cannot buy or replicate with a video
game. I love video games. Nothing to do with video

00:42:07.143 --> 00:42:15.183
games, totally different type of experience. When
we talk with the Critical Role group, and at the

00:42:15.183 --> 00:42:23.804
end of the game we still will go out to bars and
we'll be like, (sobbing) "Rest in peace, carpet."

00:42:23.804 --> 00:42:31.443
You know? To quantify it, actually, someone asked
me on Twitter-- I get this question a lot, any

00:42:31.443 --> 00:42:39.663
time I cry on the show, which, embarrassingly,
happens a lot, and when the stuff went down with

00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:51.984
the Fire Ashari-- once again, spoilers-- Fire
Ashari happened, trying to be vague, and I got

00:42:51.984 --> 00:42:58.993
really upset. People started tweeting at me, being
like, "Were you actually upset, or were you just

00:42:58.993 --> 00:43:20.212
"acting?" I was like, (pause) "Yes? Yes, both?"
It's all real. When Laura cries because Trinket

00:43:20.212 --> 00:43:29.092
goes down, she's legitimately upset that Trinket
went down; she's not acting upset. She's like, "Oh

00:43:29.092 --> 00:43:38.953
"my god, my bear just died." It's upsetting. So
it's hard to say, but I essentially share half a

00:43:38.953 --> 00:43:44.402
brain with Keyleth. Like I said, it's great,
because when we're going through the game, I'm

00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:51.053
experiencing the storyline for two people, because
I'll have my opinions, but then Keyleth also has

00:43:51.053 --> 00:44:00.922
her opinions, and she's her own person now that,
in a way, lives and breathes on her own. We'll

00:44:00.922 --> 00:44:07.054
still talk about stories, about things that
happened in game, and we're all laughing and

00:44:07.054 --> 00:44:19.202
joking like they actually happened, because they
did. They really did. What's that?

00:44:19.202 --> 00:44:20.862
AUDIENCE MEMBER: [inaudible]

00:44:20.862 --> 00:44:30.483
MARISHA: Another really good tangent. Thank you.
Sorry, getting existential on you guys now. Man, sorry.

00:44:30.483 --> 00:44:36.504
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's your favorite and least
favorite Keyleth moments?

00:44:36.504 --> 00:44:47.864
MARISHA: Favorite and least favorite Keyleth
moments. Leaping down off of the magic carpet and

00:44:47.864 --> 00:44:55.363
transforming into an earth elemental in air and
then kicking a beholder in the face was pretty

00:44:55.363 --> 00:45:07.605
dope. Pretty all about that one, that was great.
She's got great moments. First kiss with Kashaw

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:16.550
was great. Least favorite Keyleth moments? I'm
pretty sure Keyleth is probably the most

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:23.854
polarizing character on our show. People seem to
either love her or hate her. There are choices

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:31.633
that Keyleth makes that I, as Marisha, don't agree
with, but they happen because, I'm acting

00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:41.255
synonymously at the same time. It's really hard to
describe sometimes. There are some times when

00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:56.885
she'll make a choice and I'm like, "You twat."
Least favorite Keyleth moments. That's a good

00:45:56.885 --> 00:46:01.992
question. There's a few times where I wish-- It's
hard, because I think there are more in my head,

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:07.244
because a lot of times it's more moments where I
wish she would've stood up or wish she would've

00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:14.042
been a stronger person and put her foot down, and
I didn't. I wish I would've put my foot down, or

00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:20.512
Keyleth would've put her foot down, a little bit
harder about going back into General Krieg's house

00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:27.225
to try and find the extra loot when Scanlan's gang
rolled into town. I wish she would've been a

00:46:27.225 --> 00:46:33.412
little bit more adamant about that. There are a
few times when I wish-- but it all happens just

00:46:33.412 --> 00:46:43.452
like real life can. It's all development.
Sometimes things just don't work out. Yeah. That

00:46:43.452 --> 00:46:47.213
was a good question. Question? Yeah, David Tennant
again.

00:46:47.653 --> 00:46:49.850
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How are you enjoying Ireland for
the first time?

00:46:50.011 --> 00:47:01.260
MARISHA: I'm loving Ireland! It's been delightful,
you guys. It's amazing. We went on a walk this

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:08.201
morning with-- The gunpowder factory-- What?

00:47:08.201 --> 00:47:09.882
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The Gunpowder Mills!

00:47:09.882 --> 00:47:14.831
MARISHA: Yes, the Gunpowder Mills. Thank you.
Those. We did that, which is amazing. It's awesome

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:27.920
because you guys actually have history, and you
didn't bulldoze it down. It's great. Niall's been

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:38.160
taking us around and we're like, "Dude, look!
Look! This is a 300 year old pile of rocks, dude.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.180
"This is nuts." Niall's like, "Eh. I don't know."
I'm like, "No, this is incredible!" because we

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:51.912
don't have stuff like that at home, so I'm
enjoying all the ruins and the buildings. Then we

00:47:51.912 --> 00:48:03.311
went to Blarney today, which is great. It's good.
It's been awesome. I greatly enjoy it. I'm looking

00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:07.941
forward to whiskey later, though, because that
hasn't happened really, so that will probably

00:48:07.941 --> 00:48:14.802
happen. Next question? Yeah!

00:48:16.231 --> 00:48:21.791
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Has playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons
helped you get into voice acting jobs?

00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:36.091
MARISHA: (laughs) Matt will tell you a different
story. Matt trial-ran a lot of voices that he's

00:48:36.091 --> 00:48:44.911
now used in games and stuff through Dungeons &amp;
Dragons, but he's the DM, so he's 30 people,

00:48:44.911 --> 00:48:50.431
potentially, in one game. For a long time, it was
almost like his proving ground to see which

00:48:50.431 --> 00:49:00.081
characters he could get into. Honestly, it's a
really great acting exercise, Dungeons &amp; Dragons

00:49:00.081 --> 00:49:06.832
is. It's live role playing. You're trying to
pretend to be someone on the spot. Like what I was

00:49:06.832 --> 00:49:16.310
going into earlier about strengthening other
skills, everything's always going to help.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:25.621
Everything's going to help elevate your other
skills in other mediums. Since Critical Role has

00:49:25.621 --> 00:49:36.199
started, I've definitely gotten a few jobs because
of Critical Role, which is <i>crazy</i> when you think

00:49:36.199 --> 00:49:46.992
about it, that because of my Dungeons &amp; Dragons
game, I was in LEGO Marvel, and that's true. It's

00:49:46.992 --> 00:49:54.910
one hundred percent true. Because the producer of
LEGO Marvel is a fan of Critical Role, so he's

00:49:54.910 --> 00:50:03.631
like, "I want Keyleth to come do a voice." I was
like, “Okay, yeah, totally.” It’s a weird reality

00:50:03.631 --> 00:50:11.199
that I'm still wrapping my brain around. Next
question.

00:50:11.199 --> 00:50:17.590
AUDIENCE: For LEGO Marvel, did you get any LEGOs
of yourself, or any free LEGOs?

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:23.121
MARISHA: I get no free LEGOs, man! They never want
to give you products. I get a Little Caesar's

00:50:23.121 --> 00:50:28.790
Pizza commercial-- I've actually done three Little
Caesar's Pizza commercials. You guys probably

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.292
don't even have those here, do you?

00:50:30.292 --> 00:50:31.641
AUDIENCE: No.

00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:33.251
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It means something to me!

00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:41.030
MARISHA: Thank you, American guy in the back!
Another, that’s right. It's a pizza chain that's

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:51.551
garbage. It's five-dollar pizza. You can only pick
cheese or pepperoni and they have them under heat

00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:57.232
lamps, but you walk in and they hand you a pizza
for five bucks. It's great. It's terrible, but

00:50:57.232 --> 00:51:05.421
it's great. I was like, "Can I get a lifetime
supply of free pizza in my contract?" and they

00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:13.672
were like, “(laughs) No.” It was literally what
that guy did. He laughed and was like, "No." I was

00:51:13.672 --> 00:51:22.422
like, "Really?" and he was like, "We don't even do
that for our employees." I was like, "Oh, okay."

00:51:22.422 --> 00:51:27.941
It's so hard getting product out of companies.
They're a pain in the ass about it, to be honest.

00:51:27.941 --> 00:51:34.171
It's sad. But they did pay me in dollars. That,
I'm a fan of.

00:51:34.171 --> 00:51:37.602
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:51:37.602 --> 00:51:42.010
MARISHA: "Why don't I just invest in stock?" is
what I should have said. Does anyone have a

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:48.829
question? I think you had your hand up earlier,
right? No? I'm hallucinating that?

00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:53.771
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:51:53.771 --> 00:51:55.952
MARISHA: That's made of a cannon?

00:51:55.952 --> 00:52:01.072
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:52:01.072 --> 00:52:14.601
MARISHA: You Irish. Ugh, amazing. So there's
parades made out of a cannon. Like a bright--

00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:22.301
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:52:22.301 --> 00:52:31.502
MARISHA: What she said. It explodes. How many? Two
minutes? Two minutes! All right, any last

00:52:31.502 --> 00:52:38.401
questions? Matthew Mercer is next, you guys. You
can harass him. How about there.

00:52:38.401 --> 00:52:40.491
AUDIENCE: Do you have a favorite NPC from Critical
Role?

00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:48.371
MARISHA: My favorite NPC from Critical Role. I do.
I love Kima. Kima's phenomenal, and I love her

00:52:48.371 --> 00:52:56.610
even more because I hated her when we first
started. Kima legitimately pissed me off. I went

00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:01.671
home and I was just like, “She’s--” I'm talking to
Matt and pacing in the living room and I'm like,

00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:07.501
"I don't trust her! Why am I the only one who
doesn't trust-- Why did Vex and Vax look at me

00:53:07.501 --> 00:53:19.373
like I was a dick?! I'm not a dick, she's the
dick!" Matt's like-- We had our outs and now we're

00:53:19.373 --> 00:53:30.081
cool, now we're bros. There are so many. Clarota
as well, because I love him and I hate him, and he

00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:39.132
was a bastard, but he's so great. Of course,
Gilmore is another personal favorite who's been

00:53:39.132 --> 00:53:44.551
with us for a while. Love Gilmore. I think we have
time for one more question? Yeah!

00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:49.761
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:53:49.761 --> 00:53:57.471
MARISHA: I'll take you up on that. Once you’re
poor, you realize you never turn down free

00:53:57.471 --> 00:54:07.680
alcohol. Another question? Maybe one more? Maybe
we have time for another one? One last one? Yeah.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:18.070
AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:26.271
MARISHA: Does Matt roleplay NPCs at home? No.
People have asked that question, if we talk to

00:54:26.271 --> 00:54:36.332
each other in character outside of games, even
with other actors. We try not to because we want

00:54:36.332 --> 00:54:42.757
to save it for the game, is legitimately what it
is. We really try and save it for in-game, because

00:54:42.757 --> 00:54:53.150
we don't want to rob anybody of missing out on fun
stuff. There might occasionally be-- Travis slips

00:54:53.150 --> 00:55:00.069
into Grog more often than not. While we might not
necessarily talk-- I don't know, maybe that

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:07.997
counts. Like, "Hey, Travis, throw me a beer."
(Grog voice) "Oh, all right." We're just at

00:55:07.997 --> 00:55:21.170
Applebee’s, man, it's cool. It's hard when we're
half of those people. I guess that's it, you guys!

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.302
Up next is Matthew Mercer.
