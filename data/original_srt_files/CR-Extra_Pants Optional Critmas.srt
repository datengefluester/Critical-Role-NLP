00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:05,694
BRAIN: Are we on the internet? Denise?

2
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:08,529
ASHLEY: Denise isn't here, babe, we're on
vacation.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,071
BRAIN: Psh, we're not on the internet. We're on
vacation! Sorry guys, no official Talks Machina

4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:19,730
tonight. Instead, you'll be joined by the cast of
Critical Role for a very special Critmas episode.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:32,748
We'll be back next week, but until then, stay turnt
my friends.

[upbeat music]

7
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,963
LAURA: I don't know what to do.

8
00:00:58,963 --> 00:00:59,989
MARISHA: We don't have a host.

9
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:01,307
TALIESIN: We've really never had to deal with this
before.

10
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:03,806
LAURA: No, this is new.

11
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,074
DENISE: Hello!

12
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,002
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Denise?

13
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,403
DENISE: Say hello to everybody first!

14
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,879
LAURA: Hi guys, welcome to Talk Machina!

15
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,882
MARISHA: We need an adult.

16
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,136
TALIESIN: We have no adults here.

17
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:17,235
LAURA: We're gonna have a Critmas.

18
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:24,493
TALIESIN: Welcome to Critmas in May. We decided
that we would make a mess of the studio instead of

19
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,206
Matt and Marisha's house for once.

20
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:32,257
MARISHA: There's still a pile of cardboard from
our past Critmas. Need to handle that. Had to

21
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,798
handle our yard first.

22
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,816
LAURA: How's that going?

23
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:41,877
MARISHA: We fill up the trash bin or the yard bin
once a week. We think it's gonna be about a

24
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:45,738
six-week endeavor to keep filling the trash bin
with yard clippings.

25
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,719
TALIESIN: Yay 100th episode! It'll be great!

26
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,465
MARISHA: My yard will still maybe look like we're
cooking meth.

27
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,348
LAURA: By then all the weeds will have grown
back!

28
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,666
TALIESIN: They're already trying to turn again
aren't they?

29
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:01,705
MARISHA: Well actually now it's kinda happened
because the piles of leaves, the grass underneath

30
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:06,026
is just dying. It's going the extreme opposite
now.

31
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,605
LAURA: Good times.

32
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:14,469
TALIESIN: So we've been sent a lot of stuff over
the last couple months and we're aware we don't

33
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,542
actually have time to open everything but we're
going to do our best to at least-- The crew has

34
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:23,868
been generous enough to figure out some
interesting stuff and put it all together in an

35
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,913
order of interest.

36
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:30,093
LAURA: Liam and Matt are on the way by the way!
It's not just gonna be us three alone.

37
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:32,749
TALIESIN: Travis and Sam are on their way but
they'll be here by Thursday.

38
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:36,258
LAURA: Hey! There's somebody!

39
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:39,327
TALIESIN: Speak of the devil!

40
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:45,307
MARISHA: You made it sooner than you thought! Why
are you holding a bunch of stuff?

41
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:48,318
MATT: These are Critmas gifts from Joe Manganiello
for you guys.

42
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,319
TALIESIN: No! We were just talking about that! Oh
my-- what!

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,558
MATT: This is new dice for you to burn through.

44
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:03,800
LAURA: Really? Did he give me that glittery gold
one I saw online, because I wanted it so bad!

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:12,747
MATT: These are for you, Liam, Travis, and Ashley
because you guys need to take notes so Marisha

46
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:13,869
isn't the only one.

47
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,166
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

48
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,690
MATT: And then you and Sam got afterthoughts.

49
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,537
TALIESIN: That's excellent, my favorite.

50
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,374
LAURA: Look at these beautiful!

51
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:26,309
MARISHA: Oh those are cool!

52
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:31,070
LAURA: Now they're Yin and Yang, it's like me and
Vax!

53
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:41,488
MARISHA: They are and they're kind of slightly
see-through. Thanks Joe! Starting Critmas right!

54
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:45,939
LAURA: They're warm. Where have they been?

55
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,301
MATT: My car.

56
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:51,155
TALIESIN: I'm really hoping that's a
euphemism. There we are.

57
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,023
LAURA: My car!

58
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,065
TALIESIN: Ampersand!

59
00:03:55,065 --> 00:04:01,037
LAURA: By the way, I didn't realize when I made the white dragon
armor that me and Vax are now white and black,

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,738
which is so <i>fucking</i> cool!

61
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:13,168
MARISHA: You're like the Rihanna S&amp;M music video!
Or when her and Britney did it together, she was in

62
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,528
white and she was in black?

63
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,899
LAURA: I was thinking like Oreo cookies. Or Yin
and Yang.

64
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:26,617
MARISHA: Nope, I went straight to Rihanna and
Britney Spears. Okay, let's open things!

65
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:30,326
MATT: Hey everyone! I'm taking my shoes off
because I want to stink up the place.

66
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,717
LAURA: I don't have socks on, so I feel weird
about taking these off.

67
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:35,617
MATT: I was going to say it's weird that you don't have
socks on.

68
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,889
LAURA: I know! Maybe I should have worn socks or
my Birkenstocks would have been better.

69
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,117
MATT: You're fine!

70
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:46,098
LAURA: You have some coffee! For me?

71
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:47,637
MARISHA: It's for everybody.

72
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,268
LAURA: Yeah, either of those two mugs are yours.

73
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:50,804
MATT: Thank you!

74
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:56,708
MARISHA: Matt, this one's apparently for your eyes
only, and it's heavy.

75
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,308
MATT: My eyes only.

76
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:06,218
LAURA: Look at this cutie, can I open it? Or is
this for all of us to-- Should I just start going?

77
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:16,618
Number one, this envelope has the most adorable
stickers on it. Including a llama, like Henry,

78
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:19,669
that is a painting in me and Travis's house.

79
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:26,979
MARISHA: Henry, I love Henry.

80
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,728
LAURA: What? What are you laughing at?

81
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:38,149
MATT: Jamie Herald Savage sent some cool custom
elements that I can't show you guys in case they

82
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:46,095
show up in the campaign at some point down the road.
It has here stats for and some cool elements of

83
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:51,427
creatures. So thank you very much. This is going
to go into future use.

84
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:55,740
MARISHA: What happened?

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,129
MATT: What did you get, Taliesin?

86
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:03,618
TALIESIN: Terry Kobel, I hope I am pronouncing
that right, got me a beautiful copy of "English

87
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,646
"Pistols and Revolvers," leatherbound!

88
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:14,142
MATT: That is Taliesin porn. That is a direct
hit.

89
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:18,659
TALIESIN: I want to look at the foiled edges. I'm
so pleased.

90
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:19,638
MARISHA: Can I take this off?

91
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:23,778
TALIESIN: Yeah. This is beautiful.

92
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,263
LAURA: I know, right!

93
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:30,081
MATT: Show us some pages. Open it up, and show us
some pages on the inside.

94
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,749
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's just gorgeous.

95
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,197
MARISHA: Wait. Go back to the other page.

96
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:39,329
LAURA: There it is! How did you find that again
upside-down?

97
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,640
TALIESIN: I don't know how. It's just magic.

98
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,489
MARISHA: Is that a flintlock design?

99
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:53,189
TALIESIN: That is a four scythes detonating lock.
That is actually a beautiful piece of lock. I'm

100
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,180
going to be reading this. I am very excited.

101
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,587
LAURA: This is cool!

102
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,259
TALIESIN: This is beautiful.

103
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,989
MARISHA: They're all dice bags, you guys.

104
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:11,920
LAURA: But they look like dragon scale dice bags.
Says she made these right after Vax had died. This

105
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,031
is right before-- spoilers-- the resurrection of
Vax. She didn't know if he was going to be alive

106
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:25,051
when she made these. We're supposed to guess whose
is whose. I'm guessing that's yours since it's got

107
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:28,260
the-- and that one is mine.

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,134
TALIESIN: It's got the bird skull and evil.

109
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:41,071
LAURA: And this one is Scanlan's. It's Matt's. I
don't know. She double layered them. This is

110
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:44,106
Travis because it's got bones and it's Groggy.

111
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:49,974
MARISHA: This is Pike, I'm going to say. Yeah,
definitely for Pike.

112
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:54,414
LAURA: This is Scanlan. This has got to be Scanlan
with the--

113
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:56,119
MARISHA: Yes! And this is Vax.

114
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,618
LAURA: And this is Keyleth! Yay!

115
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,271
MARISHA: With the antlers!

116
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,959
LAURA: This is adorable. This is from Karen. Thank
you, Karen. And bidet!

117
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,788
MATT: Thank you for my fist warmer.

118
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:17,851
LAURA: There's something in here. (shouting) Oh my
God!

119
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:20,981
MATT: What did you get?

120
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:25,661
LAURA: She crocheted me little Trinket ears!

121
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:31,192
MATT: That's adorable. Oh my god.

122
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:32,771
LAURA: That's so freaking cute.

123
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:45,553
TALIESIN: That's Terry from Illinois.

124
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:53,182
LAURA: Where do I put this stuff? I've got so
much, I don't know what to do with it. That's

125
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,731
yours. That's Liam's.

126
00:08:54,731 --> 00:09:04,681
MARISHA: This one I actually opened first. This
person whose name is Joshua Owen Lusack or

127
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:17,225
Valkyrian Fate. Josh sent me an awesome knife,
that it was the first thing I opened when we pre--

128
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,672
ALL: Hey!

129
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:25,261
LAURA: Directing mode Liam!

130
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,982
LIAM: I am a professional.

131
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,332
MARISHA: You look like a professor in a JRPG.

132
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:33,482
TALIESIN: You never look this nice when we're
working.

133
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:35,242
MATT: You are ultimate sempai, right now.

134
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:39,673
MARISHA: Here, do you want a crochet dice bag?

135
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,371
LAURA: Did you bring your own coffee?

136
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,791
LIAM: Coffee? Yes.

137
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:48,641
LAURA: I poured you some coffee, but that's okay.
Me and you can share the other cup of coffee.

138
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:52,093
MATT: All you need right now to is fill in your
glasses with some white color so we can't see your

139
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,303
pupils.

140
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,512
LAURA: Oh my God.

141
00:09:54,512 --> 00:10:00,541
MARISHA: Joshua also sent me a bunch of Sixlets.

142
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:05,080
TALIESIN: Oh my god! Those are very exciting. I
have some plans for those.

143
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,263
LAURA: (gasps) These are Sixlets?

144
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:10,753
MATT: Whoa! They made pearlescent Sixlets?

145
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,362
MARISHA: And here's a bag that I'm going to open
right now.

146
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,382
LAURA: These look like BB pellets.

147
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:19,162
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I feel like I want to be
witnessed. That's really exciting.

148
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,413
LIAM: Who sent these, who sent these?

149
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,983
MATT: Kieran. Kieran sent those.

150
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:29,942
LIAM: "For the stealthiest and gloomiest boy
ever." It's like they know me. Yeah.

151
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:32,084
LAURA: @kirkwallman on Twitter.

152
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:41,183
TALIESIN: I love my tag, too. I'm not even going
to read it. It's so much wonderful shade. That's

153
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,855
so much shade. I love it.

154
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,774
LAURA: What do we open next?

155
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:51,023
MARISHA: Um, any one. Pick one, Liam.

156
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,454
LIAM: How's everybody's day?

157
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:54,394
LAURA: Pretty good, pretty good.

158
00:10:54,394 --> 00:11:04,749
MARISHA: Here's someone who sent us all a bunch of
sniper laser pointers that I dropped.

159
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:09,945
MATT: Oh, that's awesome! Thank you for that.

160
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,135
LAURA: This is for Percy.

161
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,674
LIAM: What are they?

162
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,844
MARISHA: This one's for the twins. They're laser
scopes.

163
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:22,073
LIAM: I'll open it.

164
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:27,675
MATT: You guys lose the ones I got you, it doesn't
matter, but if you lose the ones a Critter got

165
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,413
you... So hold on to that.

166
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:33,525
MARISHA: It's not our fault the Twitch stage is
insanity.

167
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,497
MATT: I know, this is true.

168
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,444
MARISHA: I don't know where things end up once
they land on that stage.

169
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:42,143
LAURA: We finally have a storage place to put our
stuff in between shows, guys.

170
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,053
MARISHA: That's what they look like.

171
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:50,310
TALIESIN: Oh my god, what? This is a little
intense. Oh! The batteries now make sense.

172
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,065
MARISHA: Oh, it's such a big box for batteries.

173
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:59,185
TALIESIN: There was a weird battery box that we
were shown, and they were like, "Do you know why

174
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,245
"you ordered batteries?"

175
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:04,351
LIAM: Can we blind each other with these?

176
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:09,005
TALIESIN: Yes. More importantly, we can blind Matt.

177
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,524
LIAM: Leon Kennedy.

178
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:16,245
TALIESIN: I want to know which direction-- I'm so
sorry that I'm about to do this. I don't know how

179
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,574
to help it.

180
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:18,875
MARISHA: Anyone want some Sixlets?

181
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,152
LAURA: I just want one.

182
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:25,906
MARISHA: It's like the Macy's Day Parade.

183
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:28,772
LAURA: This feels like it could be really bad,
just to throw Sixlets at the camera.

184
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:30,455
MARISHA: Oh, good catch, Courtney.

185
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:42,315
MATT: Anybody else want Sixlets off-camera? Got
it, nice! Anybody else over there? So close!

186
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,492
Sorry, we're having a Sixlets battle, apparently,
off to the side, there.

187
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:52,036
LAURA: This looks so real. It's so warm over here,
next to the fire.

188
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:57,107
TALIESIN: Oh wow. That's a lot of laser.

189
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:02,706
MATT: I would recommend you not ever shine those
in my eyes, please.

190
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:08,155
TALIESIN: They also come with a triggering
mechanism. This is really nice.

191
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,743
MARISHA: You've never had Sixlets?

192
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:13,271
MATT: They're amazing.

193
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,518
LIAM: Trigger to what?

194
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:19,956
TALIESIN: You'll love this, this is great. This is
nothing but a good idea. This'll go so well.

195
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,410
MATT: Marisha, you're opening right now?

196
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,279
MARISHA: Sure.

197
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,443
LAURA: Is this another box? Is this what you just
pulled out?

198
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,901
MARISHA: Yes. Yes, it is.

199
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:33,653
LAURA: How do I do it?

200
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:36,717
TALIESIN: See the end of that coil? That's a
squeezy trigger.

201
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,723
LAURA: What? Whoa!

202
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,477
MARISHA: This is from--

203
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:43,292
LAURA: I don't want to shine it towards you guys.

204
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:48,523
MARISHA: This is from TrappedFox, and it says,
"Dear Liam."

205
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:53,085
LIAM: Let's see. Open the box.

206
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:56,746
TALIESIN: I'm in no way going to abuse this. Not
going to abuse this at all.

207
00:13:56,746 --> 00:14:07,469
LIAM: Oh my gosh, that's perfect. Well, I'm going
to read this. You know, I'm always gun-shy about

208
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:11,691
reading things right away, because then there's a
little hidden note that says, "By the way, PS,

209
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:22,691
"don't read this on the air." Oh man, I launched
out of work like a cannon and I still got here late.

210
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:29,702
TALIESIN: In the meantime, there wasn't a card
yet, but I think it came out of this box. Someone

211
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:35,190
sent me this steampunk tarot set, which I have
admired from afar for quite a while, but I'm going

212
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,544
to-- I'm very excited.

213
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,850
MARISHA: That's fucking awesome!

214
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:49,915
MATT: There is no color in nature that should be
this vibrant. Kind of hard to see on the fire, but

215
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:59,971
if I-- that is a little, that's a nuclear blue.
And now it is inside of me.

216
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:02,610
TALIESIN: Okay. That got weird.

217
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:15,247
MATT: So. (singing) There is a thing here. Whoa,
what is this? What the heck?

218
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:27,251
LAURA: These are from Diana, a.k.a. @DruidKeyleth
on Twitter. "Thank you so much for what you do in

219
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:31,131
"the game, and for your various voice acting gigs.
I appreciate all of it, and I really hope you

220
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:36,759
"enjoy." The fanmixes! She made us mixes!

221
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,290
MARISHA: They're mixtapes.

222
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,342
MATT: That is awesome! Yay, I got a mixtape!

223
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,530
MARISHA: This is for Ashley, this one's mine.

224
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:57,791
LAURA: There's a copy for-- Mary gets one for
Zahra, there'll be another batch for Kashaw. Oh

225
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,311
man, that's so cool.

226
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:06,920
TALIESIN: I think you have maybe a series of NPC
ones.

227
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:16,199
LIAM: This is going on my desk at home. This is a
giant d20 that Chad has named the Kraken, and it's

228
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,771
made from the wood of a pistachio tree.

229
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:23,730
(laughter)

230
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,212
MATT: That's amazing!

231
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:29,800
LIAM: This is going to sit on my desk. Thank you,
Chad. This is a very special gift. Thank you.

232
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,259
MATT: That's brilliant. That's actually genuinely
really brilliant.

233
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:40,020
LIAM: Thank you, I'm really touched. Thank you for
that. Wow. This is not a die, this is a murder

234
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,250
weapon.

235
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,480
MARISHA: Is it heavy?

236
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,729
LIAM: Yeah, here.

237
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:45,354
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

238
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:49,981
LIAM: Anyone who rolls up in my office is gonna
get bludgeoning damage.

239
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:55,511
LAURA: Wow, it's so beautiful. Do you want to roll
it?

240
00:16:55,511 --> 00:17:05,261
LIAM: On a soft service, carpet. But what if I get
a one? That would be bad. Well, I'll just lie.

241
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:13,989
Here, I'll hide it. Don't tell the truth. You've
got the word "lie" right in your name. It's a 20!

242
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:22,391
It was a three. It still means a lot to me, that's
going to go right on my office desk.

243
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:34,843
LAURA: This is so pretty, though. These fanmixes
are so awesome. Mine's called "Winddancer". That's

244
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:36,151
really pretty.

245
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,950
MARISHA: I have to open mine, hang on.

246
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,592
TALIESIN: You know, I don't even want to look.

247
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,991
LAURA: I'll listen to this on my drive over before
the game, so I can get in my Vex mood.

248
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:52,032
LIAM: It's just two hours of Gregorian chant.

249
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,946
TALIESIN: One bullet is all I need.

250
00:17:53,946 --> 00:18:02,058
LAURA: We need a box to put this stuff in. I don't
know what to do with the trash.

251
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:07,002
MARISHA: Trash box? I tend to just throw it into
the ether.

252
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,793
LIAM: Did we get the name of the fan?

253
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:18,192
LAURA: My arm movement wasn't on screen of that,
like, pathetic.

254
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:21,318
LIAM: Sis! Who made these?

255
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:26,242
LAURA: These were from Diana, a.k.a.
@DruidKeyleth.

256
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:29,373
MARISHA: Mine's called "Cloudburst".

257
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:40,134
LAURA: She made a Briarwood mix. That's so
exciting.

258
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:46,633
MATT: (laughs)

259
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:48,662
LAURA: What is it? What did you get?

260
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,372
MATT: I'll show you as soon as I get it all out.

261
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:54,092
MARISHA: What do you have over there?

262
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,547
MATT: I'll show you once I get it all out, be
patient!

263
00:18:56,547 --> 00:19:01,581
LAURA: Did anybody send me some candy or some
brownies or maybe a donut?

264
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,969
MARISHA: Wait, there was another candy box over
there, hang on.

265
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,942
OFF-SCREEN: Go for one of the Australian boxes.

266
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:16,090
MARISHA: One of the Australian boxes, hang on. See
what's going on in there, because that's got

267
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,292
Whoppers on top.

268
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,214
LAURA: Wow, somebody did send candy!

269
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:25,664
TALIESIN: Yeah, we got a peek at Whoppers. I was
gonna say, we don't know what goes any further

270
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,923
than that.

271
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:30,202
LAURA: There's Whoppers and Skittles.

272
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,043
MARISHA: Ooh, sweet and sour Skittles.

273
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:41,102
LAURA: Oh, these are all for you, Marisha. Oh my
gosh. Wait, wait. You read that, and I'll pull

274
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:43,384
this out, because I want to show it to you.

275
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:49,293
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Oh man. Okay. "Well-wishes
and congrats, Keyleth, for completing her

276
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:53,613
"Aramente, though now she gets to begin the stress
of becoming a leader of her tribe and working

277
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:58,623
"through Vax's death, but regardless, I wanted to
make something and settled on a shawl, because

278
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:16,234
"girl, how are you cold--" Oh my god! This is so
cool! This is rad. What does the back look like?

279
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:19,854
I'm going to use the vanity monitor to see. It's
beautiful!

280
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,149
TALIESIN: Looks like a microphone hookup.

281
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:29,193
MARISHA: It looks like a lav. "I wanted to make
something and settled on a shawl." Because I do

282
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,566
sometimes get cold.

283
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:31,723
TALIESIN: Are we opening the Whoppers?

284
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,175
LAURA: Well, we will, but we also have these.

285
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:36,313
MARISHA: She modeled it off of the intro video.
That's so rad.

286
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:42,144
LIAM: Miles of candy. Where did Taliesin go? There
he is.

287
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:49,873
MARISHA: Thank you, Maple Scribbles! This is
amazing.

288
00:20:49,873 --> 00:21:00,526
LAURA: This is for Brian and Denise and the
wonderful people of Talks Machina. "Thank you for

289
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:08,205
"bringing such an informative, fun, creative show
each week. I hope that the TimTams lead to more

290
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:14,305
"amazing times. From Shantel. Thank you ever so
much Shantel. If Brian were here, I'm sure he

291
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,055
"would say thank you as well."

292
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,794
DENISE: Thank you!

293
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:24,474
LAURA: Black Forest TimTams, Caramel TimTams.

294
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:30,784
MATT: Guys, Emerita Colleen, elf. First off, great
letter. I'm going to go ahead and read this

295
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:40,095
offscreen, as per your request. However, she has made,
by hand, some miniatures. Tiny rat Grog.

296
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:43,069
LAURA: Wait, she made that?!

297
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:52,076
MATT: She made these with actual removable sword
of Craven Edge, which looks amazing. That's

298
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:58,085
actually really cool and really well made, with
his throwing hammer and chain of returning

299
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:10,255
attached, which is fantastic. There is a little
Pike that has her holy symbol and her mace, which

300
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:19,874
is adorable. Little armor on and everything. And
then for you, Laura Bailey, there is your Vex,

301
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:27,415
right? You have to actually string your bow, but
it's a bow with two arrows of dragon slaying

302
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,496
attached.

303
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:34,474
LAURA: What? This is crazy. Look at this
cuteness.

304
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:42,706
MATT: Isn't it adorable? So we will put these on
the Talks Machina set until the corresponding

305
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,305
individuals come to retrieve them.

306
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,438
LAURA: This is so cute. I feel like Vanna White.

307
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:55,360
MATT: Thank you so much, Emerita. These are really
amazing! I'm going to put them on set right now.

308
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,397
LAURA: I've got to string my bow, yo.

309
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:00,096
LIAM: What's up, Dani Carr?

310
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:14,771
MARISHA: You startled her with her name. It's
weird. Oh God. Someone is saying my name. Okay,

311
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:26,287
these are fun. This is from Brandy Ires aka
@elvyralani on Twitter. She says she has been

312
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:31,456
watching us since the beginning, that she plays a
druid because of me.

313
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:33,454
LIAM: Worst class.

314
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,117
MARISHA: Suck it, rogue.

315
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,147
LIAM: Love you.

316
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:41,117
MARISHA: Love you. "I've been wanting to make you
something for quite some time, months and months

317
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:46,547
"actually. While I have never been able to draw, I
am a crafter. You'll see that I made each of you a

318
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,067
"cross stitch featuring your characters."

319
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:54,318
LAURA: Is this what we saw on Twitter?

320
00:23:54,318 --> 00:24:00,406
MARISHA: I think so. "You might see some fun color
play across a few of them." These are her own

321
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:06,356
patterns. "Matt, I am working on a special one for
you that will come at a later time."

322
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:08,428
LIAM: So special.

323
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:17,075
MATT: It's made of gravy. I don't know what that
means. It's been a long couple of weeks. I'm going

324
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:18,267
crazy.

325
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:26,907
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Brandy! Okay, ready?
Here's Scanlan Shorthalt.

326
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:30,323
MATT: Trinket on a bonsai.

327
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:38,738
LAURA: I unstrung it. Are you sure that's a
Trinket?

328
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:43,240
MATT: It says Trinket on bonsai. There's a bunch
of pictures here of the minis they've made.

329
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,700
LAURA: This is amazing. Thank you.

330
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,898
MARISHA: It's a bird, you know. That makes sense.

331
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,929
LIAM: Alt universe. I got it. Aw!

332
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:59,918
MARISHA: I know. Wait, let me hold them straight.

333
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,668
LIAM: I wish I could show these to my Grandma
O'Brien.

334
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,889
MARISHA: Here you go, Taliesin. What's it say?

335
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:12,627
TALIESIN: "I live as long as Whitestone lives."
Oh, I was preparing for, "Life needs things to--"

336
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:16,378
Oh, look at it with the little mask! Oh my god!

337
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:18,506
LIAM: (singing) Happiness is a cursed gun.

338
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:24,395
TALIESIN: It's a really nice-- Oh, you've got it.

339
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:29,379
LIAM: Yeah, man. Yeah I do. Since last week.

340
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:35,268
LAURA: Oh my gosh! "It's the only way to really
grow!"

341
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:46,509
MARISHA: "I would to rage!" for Grog, of course.
Pike is, "I am a monstah!" Oh my gosh!

342
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:50,620
LAURA: Is Travis watching? Baby, look!

343
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,161
LIAM: Oh, are we a football game?

344
00:25:53,161 --> 00:26:01,340
LAURA: Maybe. He might have it on on his car ride.
Don't watch this while you're driving, Travis!

345
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,769
MARISHA: Thank you so much, Brandy! This is
amazing!

346
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:08,419
LIAM: Can I see other people's? Can I see your
stack?

347
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,259
MARISHA: Oh, "And I walk away."

348
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:26,520
LIAM: Yeah, man. Thanks for the pity chuckle!
Denise, also capable of rolling a 43 on stealth.

349
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,370
Every week.

350
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,160
LAURA: All right, bitches. Do you want to open the
coconut and lychee, the salted caramel and

351
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,978
vanilla-- that's my top choice-- or the Black
Forest?

352
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,324
TALIESIN: I think salted caramel.

353
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:42,411
LAURA: I think Black Forest sounds really fucking
good too. Dark chocolate and cherry, or salted

354
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,480
caramel?

355
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,920
MATT: Ooh, that's a rough choice. You pick. It's
your choice, Laura. You have to decide.

356
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,234
LAURA: Let's open both the Black Forest and the
salted caramel.

357
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,432
MATT: There we go.

358
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:54,370
LIAM: Is that your final answer?

359
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,183
LAURA: Here, you open this one.

360
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:06,240
MARISHA: Dani! Dani!

361
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:18,789
LIAM: This one looks exciting. I'm going to
search.

362
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:22,437
LAURA: I feel like, if Ashley was watching this on
her vacation, she'd want to come home from her

363
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,854
vacation just to eat this salted caramel.

364
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:28,290
MATT: Oh, it's nice and warm. Slippery.

365
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,771
LIAM: What's in here is cool, but I want to see if
there's a name anywhere. No?

366
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:40,831
MATT: I'm going to be an adult now and do a Tim
Tam Slam, out of red wine.

367
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:48,318
MARISHA: I did do a Tim Tam slam once, when I was
in Australia. It was a very good thing.

368
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:49,889
TALIESIN: Is that a thing there?

369
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:52,010
MARISHA: It's something I did.

370
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:58,301
LAURA: How is it?

371
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,141
MATT: Pretty good, actually.

372
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:09,517
LIAM: That is the only way to sneak
methamphetamines. So guys, we got some custom-made

373
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:20,232
Pop! toys, and there's notes inside, so I'm just
going to hand them out. You play Percy. You play

374
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,351
Kiki.

375
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:26,342
MATT: Okay, the Black Forest Tim Tam slam with red
wine, legitimately really good.

376
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:34,011
LIAM: Pass this on down to my boyfriend Shaun
Gilmore, and then we'll hold Grog and Scanlan and

377
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:42,212
Pike here. I'm taking the Vax out. Taking Vax out
is a euphemism.

378
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:44,438
TALIESIN: All right, this is happening.

379
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:48,100
LAURA: I'm going to read my letter before I open
the present.

380
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,592
MATT: I'm going to do the same.

381
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:54,703
LAURA: This is from Carly Scott!

382
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:56,611
LIAM: Who's it from?

383
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,923
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Carly Scott!

384
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:05,702
LIAM: Oh, @rudenesses is the Critter who gave me
the "Raishan Shot First" T-shirt that I wore

385
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,528
recently! So thank you again.

386
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:15,212
LAURA: By the way, she says that Vex is her
favorite. I just want to put that out there.

387
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,892
LIAM: Oh, she meant Vax.

388
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:23,493
TALIESIN: I've got to say, the amount of
unbelievable handwriting that comes my way because

389
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:25,852
of this is always spectacular.

390
00:29:25,852 --> 00:29:33,569
LIAM: How many people are watching us reading?

391
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:38,973
MATT: By the way, congrats on DMing Pathfinder.
That's awesome, by the way.

392
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:47,046
MARISHA: I love it. "Yep, Florida. I know." That's
just a great one-liner in general.

393
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:56,152
LAURA: Oh, I can't wait to look! And with glitter
tape, too!

394
00:29:56,152 --> 00:30:01,173
MARISHA: Aw, thank you so much, Carly!

395
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:09,317
LAURA: Oh! And she's winking! That's adorable!

396
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:29,631
MATT: Aw, look at little Gilmore! Oh my god! He's
amazing! Look at that man's majesty! I love his

397
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,812
little cuffs!

398
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,783
MARISHA: She's got coppery, shiny hair!

399
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:40,356
LAURA: Where will this show? I'm going to put this
right behind-- can you see her behind Liam?

400
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:42,553
LIAM: Oh!

401
00:30:42,553 --> 00:30:57,441
LAURA: That is so cute! Look at the earring! Did I
get an earring too? Oh my god, we all have

402
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,435
earrings!

403
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:07,293
MATT: Oh my god, she looks awesome! You do, you
have little sparkle earrings! Oh my god, Percy,

404
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,047
yours looks so good!

405
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:15,583
LIAM: Carly, thank you so much.

406
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,185
MARISHA: I love our earrings.

407
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:20,027
TALIESIN: The hair is really killing me.

408
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:31,844
LIAM: Ugh, I love you, but ugh, you pissed me off,
but aw, I love you! Oh no, his ear didn't make it.

409
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:37,361
I need some Krazy Glue for his ear! We got it.

410
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:46,177
MARISHA: Okay, this is from Shantelle and she
crocheted a scarf. She said it reminded her of

411
00:31:46,177 --> 00:32:00,404
Keyleth's spellcasting. Wow, that's awesome! Wow,
that's crazy! How are you guys so talented? How is

412
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:08,797
everyone so good? Oh, look how pretty. Hey buddy,
first Tim Tam?

413
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:13,643
LIAM: Ah, screw you. Oh, it's melting in my hand.

414
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:17,945
MATT: Yeah, they're a little warm.

415
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:21,385
LAURA: I feel like we need music or something.

416
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:25,716
DENISE: We have the fireplace.

417
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:32,227
LAURA: Oh, it is? Oh, so other people can hear
that?

418
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:37,712
MARISHA: Thank you, Shantelle!

419
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:44,065
LIAM: I haven't had a sugar snack in weeks.

420
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:49,125
MATT: All right, do we just pick one?

421
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:54,516
LAURA: I don't know, maybe? This looks like
something.

422
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,504
MATT: Sure, I'll take this one, whatever this one
is.

423
00:32:56,504 --> 00:33:00,473
LAURA: Wait. I can't tell.

424
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:06,561
MATT: It's from Mark Ball.

425
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:12,675
LAURA: This is for Vax and Percy. This is for
Marisha.

426
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:18,014
MATT: "Hi Matt. Lately, I've been having
nightmares. In my dreams, you are playing the new

427
00:33:18,014 --> 00:33:20,987
"Mansions of Madness expansion, but with unpainted
figures, or even worse, sometimes

428
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:25,566
"professionally painted miniatures. These minis
don't match up to the amateurish paint job that I

429
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:28,216
"did on the core set. I don't want to live in a
world where you have to play Mansion of Madness

430
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:33,704
"with mis--" Oh! You guys have the actual, the
original set with painted minis, which I still

431
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:41,967
use? Oh my god! And donated $50 to the Nature
Conservancy for Marisha Ray, which is fantastic,

432
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:49,794
from Mark Ball. That's incredible! Mark, it's
amazing! And the new Beyond the Threshold Mansions

433
00:33:49,794 --> 00:34:06,236
of Madness expansion. Wow. Oh, the minis! Oh! I'm
so happy! Oh, wow! You make me a happy man, Mark!

434
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:09,766
MARISHA: That's awesome. I really want to play
now.

435
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:13,368
MATT: We haven't messed with the expansion. This
is new to the second edition.

436
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:17,258
MARISHA: Oh, the newest one? Ooh.

437
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:19,378
MATT: This is all stuff we haven't played yet.

438
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:26,188
MARISHA: This is from Lisa. She said one of her
customers brought in to sell on consignment, and

439
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:32,585
she said they're pretty much the coolest earth
elemental mini she thinks she's ever seen. And she

440
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:41,168
thought we could put them to good use. So let's
see here. What you got, Lisa? Oh, those are sick!

441
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:53,248
Look at that! There's one. You have the other
minis.

442
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:58,489
(yelling)

443
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:04,149
MATT: Yeah, that's now your mini. I love the green
gems together!

444
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:07,867
LAURA: I just took this from her hand. I'm sorry.

445
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:14,926
MARISHA: No, it's good. Here, I'm trying to see a
little bit of a backdrop now.

446
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:20,118
LAURA: It's really hard to do that. Brian does it
every week with the Wyrmwood and it's hard.

447
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,169
MATT: That's so cool!

448
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:36,159
LIAM: Lauren G. Meyers sent Taliesin and I skull
casts. Wow. Thank you so much.

449
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,728
MARISHA: Are you going to make a--?

450
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:43,848
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm definitely going to do
something exciting with it. Something exciting's

451
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:44,987
going to happen with it.

452
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:46,612
LIAM: Yeah, I might be able to do something with
this soon.

453
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:56,887
TALIESIN: I tapped my microphone like a terrible
person. Thank you so much. This will be added into

454
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,368
something fun.

455
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:05,347
MARISHA: Man, I recognize these! It looks like
there's another red!

456
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,222
TALIESIN and LAURA: Oh my god!

457
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:10,636
LIAM: Screw those bastards!

458
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:13,640
MARISHA: Oh, what are these?

459
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,122
LAURA: Unicorns! Who are they for?

460
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:24,991
MARISHA: Let's see, because we already got the
first round.

461
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,587
LAURA: I took the white one last time.

462
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:40,136
MARISHA: She said sorry for her crappy writing,
that her two-year-old was demanding her attention

463
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:43,650
at the time of writing this. "Dearest Matthew
Mercer and Marisha Ray--"

464
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,491
LAURA: It's all for you.

465
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:59,093
MARISHA: "Having watched the Vox Machina
methodically--" Hang on, wait. Oh, "destroy the

466
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:08,114
"dragons, therefore--" Right, hang on. Aw, she
wanted us to have a complete set.

467
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:11,967
MATT: That's so sweet!

468
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,340
LAURA: It's so much work!

469
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:23,187
MARISHA: She knew I didn't want to give up Raishan
to Patrick, which I still haven't yet, so that we

470
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:30,910
could actually give the original to Patrick and I
could have the second Raishan. This is amazing. I

471
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,229
can't believe that you went through all of this
again.

472
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:42,279
LAURA: Does it say that we have to give the
pegasus to somebody specific, or does it say that,

473
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,599
if you're at the opening of the Critmas presents,
and you really like the pink pegasus, you can have it?

474
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,820
LIAM: Laura, take it. It's yours.

475
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,958
MARISHA: It was an alicorn to represent Gilmore.

476
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:01,365
MATT: Oh, for Shaun? That's amazing.

477
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:07,110
LAURA: How's that reading going for you?

478
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,504
MARISHA: And apparently, wait, gray elephant?

479
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:21,792
LAURA: Wait. There's a gray dragon. Oh no! We're
missing a gray elephant!

480
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:28,161
MARISHA: Right? "Also, the gray elephant is for
Taliesin." Right? That does say--?

481
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:30,872
TALIESIN: It does. I think it does.

482
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:34,549
MARISHA: "One blunderbuss away from becoming a
quarterman."

483
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:39,239
TALIESIN: That's pretty cute. Highly entertained.

484
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:45,957
MARISHA: Anyway, thank you so much, Stacy! These
are all Stacy and Glenn for round two.

485
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,812
ALL: Thank you!

486
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:50,471
MARISHA: We will read your letter in detail
later.

487
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:56,799
LIAM: This one doesn't say who it's from, unless
it's from the company Field Notes Brand, but it's

488
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:01,650
a bunch of little field notebooks, and I can only
believe that somebody wants the rest of us to take

489
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,013
the heat off Marisha and start taking notes.

490
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:07,468
LAURA: I take notes! Just not as good as Marisha
takes.

491
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:12,380
MARISHA: Well, we have pillars. You're good as the
treasury.

492
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,050
LAURA: I do take really detailed treasury notes.

493
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,342
MARISHA: Yeah, you do take detailed treasury
notes, and Travis takes detailed Bag of Holding

494
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,373
notes.

495
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:31,002
MATT: All right, we have a bunch of presents here
from what looks like @ACL_TeamKilla that sent a

496
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:41,605
bunch of bags of varying Skullsplitter Dice.
Different colors and types, so Laura, you can tear

497
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:44,523
through as many to your heart's content of various
dice sets.

498
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:46,062
LIAM: I want some! Laura doesn't get them all!

499
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:47,032
LAURA: All for me!

500
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:49,881
MATT: We have two large bags, so you guys have
plenty. We can go through and distribute. I'm

501
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:57,403
going to put them over here. And a letter that I'm
not going to say because he's nudging things that

502
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,291
you players need to remember anyway.

503
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:05,652
LAURA: Here's a wonderful present from Kristin and
Brad, and I'm going to read this letter because

504
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,223
it's short and it's perfect.

505
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:08,782
MATT: Who wants some Bilar? Sorry.

506
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,461
LAURA: Okay. I don't know what that is.

507
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:11,793
MATT: They're like gummies.

508
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,739
LAURA: I'll eat it. "We figured you guys were
getting tired of looking up potion types all the

509
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:20,698
"time, so we made these super awesome bottles for
you to use on your adventures. One set for each

510
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:28,114
"table. Each bottle contains the appropriate number
of d4s that you need for your roll, ranging from

511
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:34,643
"common to supreme. Good luck, and keep being
awesome. Kristin and Brad." Kristin and Brad are

512
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:39,724
super duper cool, and by the way, have we ever had
a supreme healing potion?

513
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:40,722
MATT: Yeah.

514
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:42,483
LAURA: We have? With 20d4?

515
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:46,760
MATT: It's not 20d4.

516
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,283
LAURA: Yeah, superior, eight. Supreme, 20. We've
never had a supreme.

517
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:55,716
MATT: I'll double-check.

518
00:40:55,716 --> 00:41:01,389
TALIESIN: I had been working on putting one of
these together, and now I don't have to, which is

519
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:02,451
very pleasing.

520
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:03,883
LAURA: That's so cool.

521
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:16,938
MARISHA: Oh, shit! I don't know who this came
from, but this is a journal, it's a leather

522
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:19,215
journal, and they've got "kaitiake" stamped in
it.

523
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:28,383
MATT: Oh my god, that's awesome.

524
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:33,093
LAURA: Is it spelled right? Is that how you spell
"kaitiake"?

525
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:40,025
MARISHA: That is the official Maori spelling of
it. I've changed it a little bit originally, but

526
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:47,855
that's the original spelling, so it's accurate.
That's amazing.

527
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:50,620
LAURA: The green ones don't taste as good as the
pink ones.

528
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:58,503
LIAM: I have a present for us here from Derek
Wilson, @cart_exists. He sent some customized

529
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:03,538
coasters, two for each of us. Some of the quotes
you might remember, they stand out, like Scanlan.

530
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:10,665
"You spice?" And Matthew's say "How do you
derr-de-derr-derr?" But some of them are

531
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:15,743
lesser-known. Grog's is "I have an intelligence of
six, I know what I'm doing." Keyleth's says "We're

532
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:26,057
"all cows, just embrace it." Percy's medium-iconic,
"I'm in the pyjamas with the butt-flap. The

533
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:36,732
"butt-flap is down." Pike, "This temple goes to a
six." Vex's say, "I'm going to attack it twice,

534
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:44,544
"because I'm original." And Vax's says, "She's
working for the Illuminati and we're basically the

535
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:50,995
"A-Team, so I think she might know a little
better." Thank you very much, Derek.

536
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:54,146
LAURA: These are for you.

537
00:42:54,146 --> 00:43:02,106
TALIESIN: I've got a thought. I'll show one of
them, just so they get the notion of it.

538
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:11,419
MATT: I've found the right note, so @AC_teamkilla
is actually from Sweden, it says, "Greetings from

539
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:15,276
"Sweden." And this is a box of their love and glory
of Grog. So most of these gifts are for Grog, so

540
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:22,486
the two big bags of dice? They're for Grog. The
drinking horn in here? That's for Grog. So I'm

541
00:43:22,486 --> 00:43:25,484
going to put those in here, and you can bring
those home to Travis, and he can enjoy and

542
00:43:25,484 --> 00:43:27,346
distribute as he sees fit.

543
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:31,376
LIAM: No, no, Travis said that anything that he
got when he's not here goes to me, so I will take

544
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,796
those home.

545
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:41,219
MATT: Gave me metal dwarven dice as well. That's
fantastic. That is really, really cool.

546
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:48,663
LAURA: Oh my gosh, wait. This is from-- hold on,
I've got to see who it's from, because this is

547
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:57,416
really cool. This is from Jay Anthony Pierpoli and
the rest of the Critter community, who sent,

548
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:02,854
number one, a fanfiction that I will definitely
read that they say is phenomenal by Sarah Louise

549
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:09,967
Harper. And also, this is so cool, I wish Sam was
here. I'm opening his present for him, because I

550
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,646
like opening things.

551
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:12,817
MATT: What?!

552
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,842
LAURA: It's a wrap for his giant mug.

553
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:20,036
(exclamations)

554
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:22,307
MATT: That is incredible. Look at the leather-work
on that!

555
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:35,872
LAURA: I know, it's amazing! He said he made it
before he realized Scanlan was not here. How cool

556
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:37,327
is this?

557
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:39,335
MATT: That's badass. Little holders, too!

558
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:43,367
LAURA: Insane! Where's his little mug? Is it up
here?

559
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:45,545
MATT: Let me check. I'll go get it.

560
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:54,578
TALIESIN: I'm going to do this and hope to not
make a mess. Hah. Oh, wow, we've lost Matt. Oh

561
00:44:54,578 --> 00:44:56,687
yeah, the mug's probably in the-- yeah.

562
00:44:56,687 --> 00:45:06,058
MARISHA: Oh, that's awesome. John and Deb O'Brien
sent a copy of one of their favorite bands for us

563
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:17,036
to listen to. So thank you so much, John and Deb.
And then-- oh, I see what you're doing.

564
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:23,380
LAURA: We have to put it on so he'll have it in
the next show when he finally brings his mug out

565
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:30,529
again. Oh my god! It looks so cool.

566
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:34,488
MATT: We're not going to tell him about it. He'll
just find it with it on.

567
00:45:34,488 --> 00:45:49,426
LAURA: Oh man. I don't have anything. I'll take
it.

568
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:57,240
MARISHA: Okay, Matt, this is from Beth Fleven.

569
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,264
LAURA: From Joseph, we need to remember it's from
Joseph.

570
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:08,032
MARISHA: She sent us something in a diapers box. I
don't know if that's--

571
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:16,030
TALIESIN: I think she's sick and tired of us
getting up in the middle of the game. Message

572
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,440
received. That will be the last time you saw any
of us get up in the middle of the game.

573
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:31,290
LIAM: Check this out. Check this out.

574
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,974
LAURA: So ridiculous.

575
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:38,753
(laughter)

576
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:43,370
LIAM: Best t-shirt I've ever been sent. Of all the
other t-shirts I've been sent, this is the best

577
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,531
one. Look at that!

578
00:46:45,531 --> 00:46:48,181
MARISHA: That is a very fluorescent orange shirt.

579
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,421
LIAM: Yes, and I will don it proudly.

580
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:52,041
MARISHA: Go jogging in that shirt.

581
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,156
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

582
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:56,685
(laughter)

583
00:46:56,685 --> 00:47:04,504
TALIESIN: Oh my. This is from @irish_mike. "To
Taliesin: To conquer your fear, you must face it.

584
00:47:04,504 --> 00:47:14,274
"Stay beautiful." And I got a bag of Swedish Fish.
I fear these, but not for the same reason. Thank

585
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:21,530
you. Thank you very much. Oh, I'm going to be in
trouble when I bring these home. Oh, this is so

586
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,532
exciting.

587
00:47:22,532 --> 00:47:28,242
LIAM: This print-art shirt is from Jeff Kielessen,
who lives where many of my kin live.

588
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:44,518
MARISHA: Okay, so Beth wrote a letter to Matt and
I, but the gift is for Liam. Beth is thanking us

589
00:47:44,518 --> 00:47:52,577
for the game, she says, "Enclosed in this box is a
handmade gift for Liam. I began making it just

590
00:47:52,577 --> 00:48:00,031
"after he defeated Thordak. I thought it fitting
that the slayer of Thordak should have one of the

591
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:05,171
"eggs to keep as a trophy." There you go, bud.

592
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:33,236
LIAM: Can I see the letter? Hold on. Oh, man. Oh,
I got a letter, too. I'm going to read the letter

593
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:35,333
first. No, you all are waiting on me.

594
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,902
LAURA: No, too bad, I'm doing this one.

595
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:46,513
LIAM: Look at this amazing motherfucker right
here. Oh, yes! Yes. Ah, facehugger's in it!

596
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:53,069
MATT: I did it! It's on. That is ridiculous.

597
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:54,369
LAURA: How heavy is that?

598
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:56,595
MATT: What, the whole thing? It's got a nice heft
to it.

599
00:48:56,595 --> 00:49:00,426
(laughter)

600
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:01,590
MATT: Now fill it with liquid.

601
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,277
LAURA: Oh my god. How does he pick this up? Does
he pick it up one-handed?

602
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:07,247
MATT: Gnome strength.

603
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:10,328
LAURA: What does he put on the bottom? Oh, it's
his little code.

604
00:49:10,328 --> 00:49:15,127
TALIESIN: Where is this from? This is "To Matthew
Mercer." Where is this from?

605
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:18,891
MARISHA: From Elliott Cole from Australia.

606
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:28,444
MATT: What is in the thing? What are you finding
in the thing?

607
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:32,455
TALIESIN: All right, let's see what happened.

608
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:34,008
LAURA: Oh, wow!

609
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:36,426
MATT: What?

610
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:51,008
LAURA: I know! This is so cool! This is from
Jennifer Knight. She designed this and stitched it

611
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:57,459
herself, with a panel for each character, and
these panels are super duper detailed.

612
00:49:57,459 --> 00:49:59,826
MATT: I love the frame on this.

613
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:09,763
LAURA: The frame is awesome! The freaking
stitching is awesome! With museum glass.

614
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:13,523
MATT: Where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors roll
dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. Aw!

615
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:17,212
LAURA: Look at these panels! This is so cool!

616
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:19,919
MARISHA: That's so great!

617
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:23,573
LAURA: We should hang this on set.

618
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:25,946
MATT: That's fantastic.

619
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:30,838
TALIESIN: I'm actually excited because we have
room for art suddenly because we just redecorated

620
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:31,891
a bit.

621
00:50:31,891 --> 00:50:34,152
LAURA: Oh wow, it's really well done.

622
00:50:34,152 --> 00:50:36,329
LIAM: Beth, thank you, and thank you.

623
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:42,389
MARISHA: Amazing! What's happening?

624
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:44,640
TALIESIN: I don't know what this is. But things
are happening.

625
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:57,670
MATT: Progress is occurring. (singing) Freedom!
Sweet freedom, freedom! You've got to give what

626
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,319
you take.

627
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:01,890
TALIESIN: They wrapped this very well.

628
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:05,790
MATT: Whatever it was is in seven pieces.

629
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,740
TALIESIN: Another door!

630
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,319
MATT: It's just a small door. It would make so
much sense.

631
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,500
MARISHA: Are you getting it out?

632
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,191
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're getting there.

633
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,577
MATT: I'm so curious now.

634
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:24,283
TALIESIN: It's just an infinite amount of
wrapping! All the way down.

635
00:51:24,283 --> 00:51:30,099
MARISHA: Oh my God! You guys!

636
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:35,163
MATT: What? It's a guitar.

637
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:36,995
LAURA: It's pink.

638
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:40,321
LIAM: What! Whoa! Oh my God!

639
00:51:40,321 --> 00:51:45,111
MATT: (yelling) What?!

640
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:49,392
LAURA: That is so cool!

641
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:52,632
LIAM: On the set!

642
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:57,891
MATT: (Gilmore voice) "That is glorious. What else 
can you say but, that's glorious?"

643
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:00,147
LAURA: Do you want to hold this, Matthew?

644
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:05,922
MATT: "Now you know where to shop, am I
right?" That is incredible!

645
00:52:05,985 --> 00:52:08,315
LAURA: I feel like we just won the lottery.

646
00:52:08,315 --> 00:52:15,836
MATT: Look in the back, it has our symbol engraved!
Elliott Cole, incredible work, Elliott! That is

647
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:24,140
amazing! One day at home I'm like, "You know, just
make up some magic shop with some dude named

648
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,737
"Gilmore." Years later-- That's amazing.

649
00:52:28,737 --> 00:52:33,505
LAURA: I wonder if it'll fit in one of those boxes
above Trinket's head.

650
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,036
MATT: It's a bit big for one of those.

651
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:41,146
LAURA: Oh, I mean the cross-stitching. Gilmore can
maybe go right there next to the other Gilmore!

652
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:43,639
Gilmore is world famous.

653
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,320
MATT: I just want this in front of our house now.

654
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,487
LAURA: I know, right! Can you just hang that in
your living room? I wouldn't blame you if you want

655
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:50,847
to take it.

656
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:54,198
MATT: It's incredible! Holy shit! Oh man, it
should live on set for a little while at least.

657
00:52:54,198 --> 00:52:55,666
Then I'm going to take it home.

658
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,799
LAURA: Just above your bed?

659
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,797
TALIESIN: We need more hooks. We definitely need
more hooks.

660
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:07,488
LAURA: Yeah. Oh gosh, careful; those were hung
pretty precariously. But that's okay! No, it's

661
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:10,797
great. We'll rearrange our--

662
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:20,268
(yelling)

663
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:21,389
LAURA: That's really remarkable.

664
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:22,719
MATT: I can't function right now.

665
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,365
LAURA: It's done so well!

666
00:53:25,398 --> 00:53:28,114
MATT: It's done <i>really</i> well. Have you seen it up
close?

667
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:35,838
TALIESIN: I have not seen it up close. Oh my God,
really? What lunacy. What lunacy is this?

668
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:50,775
LIAM: This is something for Sam. So many Critters
were involved in this. So many! This is a list of

669
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:53,146
the Critters involved in the making of this.

670
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,874
LAURA: Is that the same people who do the quotes?
It's a quilt?

671
00:53:56,874 --> 00:53:59,117
LIAM: Yeah. This for Sam, we should show it on air,
right?

672
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:04,213
LAURA: Oh, I feel like Sam should be the one that
opens it up, though. It's his quilt?

673
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:08,945
LIAM: But like, don't we want to acknowledge the
work put into this?

674
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:13,747
LAURA: Maybe we can give it to him on Thursday.
Because I loved mine.

675
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:20,035
LIAM: Okay. God, I recognize so many names on this
list. Yeah, that's what we'll do. We'll bring it

676
00:54:20,035 --> 00:54:22,439
on Thursday on the top of the show.

677
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:29,852
LAURA: What happened?

678
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:35,513
TALIESIN: The note went-- The tape's not sticking
anymore and it just gave me a mild heart attack.

679
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:37,341
That's all.

680
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:38,825
LIAM: For Sam for later.

681
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:46,278
MARISHA: Okay, I think these are fun. That one
goes to Liam. This one's Taliesin, Laura, and

682
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:52,465
Matt. We already pulled Ashley and Sam's and
Travis' and put them over there. Isn't it

683
00:54:52,465 --> 00:54:53,432
adorable?

684
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:59,053
LAURA: Oh yeah, read the card!

685
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:09,293
MARISHA: Oh, they put 'Risha' on here. I haven't
been called Risha since high school.

686
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:16,726
MATT: "There once was a DM called Matt/He could
swap characters at the drop of a hat/His city he

687
00:55:16,726 --> 00:55:19,650
"burned/But his trust was returned/And his story
never once fell flat."

688
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,386
ALL: Aww.

689
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:27,018
LAURA: "What can I say about lovely Laura/Her
friends and the fandom adore her/Her comebacks are

690
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:31,686
"quick/Her winks are slick/There's not a soul alive
that abhors her."

691
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:33,366
ALL: Aww.

692
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:35,388
LAURA: If you read that sarcastically...

693
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:38,316
(laughter)

694
00:55:38,316 --> 00:55:45,947
MARISHA: "Marisha, a word to the wise/There are
those in the world who despise/Rise above the

(laughter)

697
00:55:54,723 --> 00:55:56,046
MATT: That's amazing!

698
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:57,529
LIAM: Is that a feat you took?

699
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:00,319
LAURA: Chun Li thighs?

700
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:08,366
TALIESIN: "It's hard to write rhymes about
Taliesin/Wild imagination he's boundless in/The

MARISHA: Oh, I can think of a few.

703
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,296
TALIESIN: I can think of a few, too.

704
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:22,367
LIAM: "There once was a swell guy named Liam/Many
players just wanted to be him/He often played

705
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:28,728
"risky/But never played briskly/To his haters, come
on, it's a ga-em."

706
00:56:28,728 --> 00:56:37,676
(laughter)

707
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:40,736
LIAM: No, seriously, it's life or death. There's
nothing to joke about. This is Dungeons and

708
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:41,764
Dragons.

709
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,688
MATT: Thank you so much, Vee, these are so cute!

710
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:47,400
LAURA: What did you do?

711
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:56,958
MATT: They're all shirts of my face. What? What?!

712
00:56:56,958 --> 00:57:00,955
LAURA: They're team hoodies! They are team
hoodies!

713
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,501
MARISHA: Oh my god, mine says 'Keteor'!

714
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:06,738
LIAM: #FateTouched.

715
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:09,843
MARISHA: Hunter's Mark. What's yours?

716
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:21,380
MATT: That's incredible.

717
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,189
LAURA: Team hoodies! Just in case you guys didn't
know who I am.

718
00:57:24,189 --> 00:57:28,429
MATT: Layering all the sweaters right now.
Multi-hood.

719
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:29,969
TALIESIN: We multi-hooding?

720
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,503
MATT: I'm multi-hooding.

721
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:41,258
LIAM: Oh my goodness gracious. Oh my goodness.
We've got to go bowling right after the show.

722
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:43,828
LAURA: (gasps) We have to go bowling in our
hoodies!

723
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:47,219
OFFSCREEN: Nerdiest biker gang.

724
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:52,219
MATT: Yeah, you're not wrong.

725
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:56,980
LAURA: Can we just all go somewhere in our hoodies?

726
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:02,509
MATT: This is ridiculous.

727
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:08,420
LAURA: That's awesome. Wait, who's that from?
That's from Vee. But I can't see the full name, it

728
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,699
just says Vee!

729
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,499
MATT: And we got chocolates from her, too.

730
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:12,866
LAURA: And she gave chocolates.

731
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:14,569
MATT: Thank you, Vee, you're amazing!

732
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:15,770
LAURA: Or he!

733
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,723
MARISHA: And chocolate.

734
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:19,952
MATT: It's Vee. You don't know what Vee is.

735
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:31,110
LAURA: You have so many more boxes.

736
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,312
MATT: I just like making Max do stuff, actually.

737
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:40,717
TALIESIN: I'm getting a little warm, actually. I
was okay, and then I realized, no, I'm cooking a

738
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,220
little bit.

739
00:58:42,220 --> 00:59:01,373
MATT: From @lightningsource, the book of-- what?
What?! 5e game supplement, The Book of the

740
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:03,009
Tarrasque.

741
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:05,800
LAURA: What is-- oh no! That's the scary guy,
right?

742
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,711
MATT: No, no, he's fun, he's the teddy bear of
D&amp;D.

743
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,085
LAURA: Is that the big scary figure that I saw at
your house?

744
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:12,430
MATT: No.

745
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,642
MARISHA: He's lying, Laura, he's lying!

746
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:16,049
MATT: That one, you mean?

747
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:17,810
LAURA: (yells) Yeah, that one.

748
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:29,961
MATT: That's so cool! It's like a tarrasque
coloring book/adventure module-- oh my god, this

749
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:37,683
book is so cute! It's so awesome! With a foreword
by Ed Greenwood. Yeah, baby. Got some Forgotten

750
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:39,550
Realms blood in this.

751
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:45,301
MARISHA: Someone sent Chozo fine quality coffee.

752
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:49,719
LAURA: Maybe there's weed in there! That's how
people--

753
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,882
MARISHA: Send weed. Where does it open?

754
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:57,071
LAURA: You didn't hear that from us. I just had
heard that on the internet.

755
00:59:57,071 --> 01:00:03,391
MATT: I'm genuinely excited because the base rules
for the tarrasque in 5e are all right, but there

756
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,672
are some cool elements of the tarrasque from
previous editions that didn't make it in. This has

757
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:10,065
a whole separate page for optional tarrasque
rules, which include things like its tiered

758
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:15,581
regeneration, which I kind of miss, and other cool
elements. The rush-- oh my god, trample--

759
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:22,220
(cackles) I'm so excited! This is so cool! I
didn't know this book existed! I'm so happy! Who

760
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:28,532
sent this? I don't know who sent this. This is
from @lightningsource. I guess?

761
01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:32,933
TALIESIN: See if there's a slip of paper.
Sometimes there's a little slip of paper.

762
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:39,689
MATT: I'm looking! Whoever sent this, you're
amazing, thank you! I don't see. Tell me. Message

763
01:00:39,689 --> 01:00:41,822
me or e-mail me. Thank you, that's so awesome.

764
01:00:41,822 --> 01:00:46,257
(off-screen laughter)

765
01:00:46,257 --> 01:00:49,931
MATT: Don't laugh at me. I'm forever 12, okay?

766
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:52,893
TALIESIN: (laughs)

767
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:55,370
MATT: Taliesin, you can laugh at me if you want.

768
01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:00,216
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I feel like I've
earned that right. I've seen things. Terrible,

769
01:01:00,216 --> 01:01:01,845
terrible things.

770
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:13,962
MATT: What? I got a-- "Guaranteed forever, Husky
utility knives". That's actually extremely handy.

771
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:22,052
LAURA: He's set. He's three daggers in. I've got a
tag on the inside of my sleeve. I've got to get it out.

772
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:25,276
MATT: Well, thank you, whoever sent utility
knives.

773
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:26,983
TALIESIN: Is there a note with--

774
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:36,465
MATT: Oh, there you go. Here we go. There it is.
"Hi Matt. After watching you post Christmas

775
01:01:36,465 --> 01:01:39,624
"holiday on Periscope with Marisha and Taliesin and
Brian, I thought these might come in handy. Love

776
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:44,387
"the show and everything you do. Please avoid
needing stitches. Casey Wall." Yep, you knew

777
01:01:44,387 --> 01:01:46,958
exactly what I was talking about. Those are
actually going to be really handy. That's so

778
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:48,222
awesome. Thank you so much.

779
01:01:48,222 --> 01:01:49,523
MARISHA: They sent box-cutters?

780
01:01:49,523 --> 01:01:55,764
MATT: Yeah. We kept losing ours, and we couldn't
find the one of the two we had, and then two

781
01:01:55,764 --> 01:01:57,932
disappeared. Thank you very much.

782
01:01:57,932 --> 01:02:07,860
LIAM: All right. Vicky Banks made us individual
goodie bags with different things in them. I'm

783
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:12,495
going to pass yours down. There's a letter with
each. I read the overall letter. Thank you,

784
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:13,471
Vicky.

785
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:15,432
MATT: Thank you, Vicky.

786
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:19,100
LIAM: The bags are individualized. I got a theatre
nerd bag.

787
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,394
LAURA: Of course.

788
01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:22,797
TALIESIN: I have "Life needs things to live."

789
01:02:22,797 --> 01:02:24,500
LAURA: Ooh, that's Marisha's.

790
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,628
MARISHA: "Call me 'child' one more time."

791
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:33,654
LAURA: With Hamilton on the bag! Did you guys get
Hamilton on the back of yours?

792
01:02:33,654 --> 01:02:37,161
MATT: Mine has the Witcher symbol on it, I'm so
happy. It has the medallion.

793
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:40,002
MARISHA: Mine has little grasping vines.

794
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:49,420
TALIESIN: Ooh! Ooh, a Thor's hammer on a string,
excellent. I will wear that.

795
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,891
LAURA: Oh, cool.

796
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:54,954
MARISHA: I got a wine cork. They know. They know.

797
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:58,232
TALIESIN: Oh, blue glitter. No, that will go. I
know what that is.

798
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:04,029
MARISHA: Oh, this is adorable. It's because I am
the winespeaker. Eat, drink, and be married.

799
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:06,585
LAURA: Oh, that's wonderful.

800
01:03:06,585 --> 01:03:14,595
LIAM: Oh, hi, you guys. Do you like my new hat?

801
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:17,153
MATT: That's fantastic.

802
01:03:17,153 --> 01:03:36,264
LIAM: I don't know what you're laughing at. What's
this? I don't know what this is.

803
01:03:36,264 --> 01:03:42,483
MARISHA: Okay, this is an amazing letter.

804
01:03:42,483 --> 01:03:45,586
LIAM: (Gollum voice) What is it?

805
01:03:45,586 --> 01:04:01,284
MARISHA: This is an amazing letter from Marsha
Hanif, or @1opinonated on Twitter, and she tells

806
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:06,184
this amazing story about her and--

807
01:04:06,184 --> 01:04:08,894
MATT: Too many heads.

808
01:04:08,894 --> 01:04:15,100
MARISHA: --about one of her characters getting
into a fight because she didn't want to get thrown

809
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,737
into a fight that they couldn't handle on their
mission, and it reminded her of Keyleth versus

810
01:04:19,737 --> 01:04:30,785
Kima in the Underdark and how much their game has
become better by watching Critical Role. Thank you

811
01:04:30,785 --> 01:04:37,583
so much for all the kind words, Marsha, this is
amazing. Truly amazing.

812
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:41,652
MATT: Got an awesome Matthew bottle opener. Sorry,
I'm still going through Vicky's present.

813
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:43,139
LAURA: Yeah, me too.

814
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:44,718
TALIESIN: I know, it's got layers.

815
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:55,125
MARISHA: Gloves and hat. Oh, this is so cute!

816
01:04:55,125 --> 01:05:05,826
MATT: When the DM smiles, it's already too late.
That's awesome. Mercer '82.

817
01:05:05,826 --> 01:05:13,676
LAURA: I got a DCA: Dice Collectors Anonymous
t-shirt.

818
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,426
MATT: It's about time you finally admitted you had
a problem, Laura.

819
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:19,390
ALL: Thank you, Vicky.

820
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:26,518
MATT: These are so cute! Oh my god. I love the
bag, too.

821
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:29,035
LAURA: That's adorable.

822
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:31,316
TALIESIN: Thank you so much.

823
01:05:31,316 --> 01:05:46,241
MATT: These are from Dennis Archimbault Jr. I
should not read things from the side. Dennis

824
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:55,767
Archimbault Jr. sends a bag that is-- it's a pizza
box.

825
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:59,207
TALIESIN: Also, it's been over 30 minutes, so it's
free.

826
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:15,495
LIAM: It's kidneys. It could be a dead thing.

827
01:06:15,495 --> 01:06:18,648
MATT: Oh, what?

828
01:06:18,648 --> 01:06:22,551
LAURA: What is that?

829
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:36,009
MATT: Oh my god. This is a person's entire
Warhammer ogre army collection, handpainted by

830
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:48,678
them. All of their individual Warhammer ogre
minis. This is awesome. They said they haven't

831
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:53,775
touched them in about five years, so "in interest
of the minis finding a better life than spending

832
01:06:53,775 --> 01:07:00,378
"eternity on a shelf, decided to bequeath them unto
you." I hit my microphone, sorry. These are

833
01:07:00,378 --> 01:07:05,558
amazing. These handpainted ogres.

834
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:10,629
LAURA: I mean, they're really detailed. Look at
that guy!

835
01:07:10,629 --> 01:07:17,560
MATT: Dennis, not only did you do an amazing job
on painting these, but I have all the ogres-- oh

836
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:25,028
yeah, I know that guy. That's incredible. The
ogres are some of the cooler models in the old

837
01:07:25,028 --> 01:07:31,065
Warhammer fantasy stuff. That one, let's pull it
out, let's see what he's all about.

838
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:32,777
LAURA: He's got like a mask.

839
01:07:32,777 --> 01:07:34,082
LIAM: Yeah, what is that?

840
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:43,509
LAURA: What's this thing? (gasps) It's a little
goblin in there! And he goes on his back. Goblin

841
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:45,448
down, goblin down!

842
01:07:45,448 --> 01:07:53,927
MATT: There he goes. He's got like a standard with
a little goblin riding on his back. That's so

843
01:07:53,927 --> 01:07:59,977
cool! Dennis, you're amazing! I will take good
care of this. Thank you so much.

844
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:06,258
LIAM: You're turning into one of those old ladies
from Labyrinth with the 500 things on her back.

845
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:07,859
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

846
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:15,522
LAURA: A really eclectic grandma.

847
01:08:15,522 --> 01:08:20,406
MARISHA: Hey, Matt. Are you okay with this being
your future?

848
01:08:20,406 --> 01:08:27,149
MATT: Oh, I was just assuming we'd both be bag
people eventually. I make no illusions.

849
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:32,921
MARISHA: I've got to get over to the 99-cent store
before they close for the day.

850
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:40,973
MATT: We live in the Valley, we die in the Valley,
all right? Thank you so much, Dennis.

851
01:08:40,973 --> 01:08:44,989
LIAM: "Do you have any purple soda left?"

852
01:08:44,989 --> 01:08:48,112
MATT: Dennis, oh my god. Oh my god.

853
01:08:48,112 --> 01:08:58,502
LAURA: Is that full? Oh my god. Did we open
everything?

854
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:06,795
MARISHA: Well, this is a really big one that--
guess who's in? You know what this is.

855
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:14,499
(gasping)

856
01:09:14,499 --> 01:09:17,028
MATT: The Conclave is complete!

857
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,733
LAURA: Oh gosh, oh gosh, here's the letter.

858
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:20,977
MATT: Read the letter.

859
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:31,153
LAURA: Okay, okay, I'm reading it. This is to the
cast of Critical Role. Wow. "Congratulations. The

860
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:35,777
"adventure that spanned nearly a year, taking our
intrepid heroes across the planes of existence to

861
01:09:35,777 --> 01:09:40,638
"the very threshold of death's door and back, has
finally come to an end. Enclosed is the mounted

fall to the valiant Vox Machina, Raishan, the

"Diseased Deceiver." This is so cool. "What an
adventure this has been. This little undertaking

864
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:55,712
"started just as a fun project to work on with my
sister, and thank you all for the wonderful work

"that you do to bring this amazing story to so
many, but it quickly turned into something much

866
01:09:59,373 --> 01:10:03,596
"more important than that. It was the spark that
reignited my passion for my craft and rekindled my

"love for the wonderful shared storytelling
experience of Dungeons and Dragons, and for that,

final member of the Chroma Conclave--"

869
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:25,359
(exclaiming)

870
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:27,066
MARISHA: I love that they're to scale.

871
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:32,194
LAURA: You've just got to lance them, you know.
Sometimes you've got to go to the doctor, even, if

872
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,370
it's too big--

873
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,170
LIAM: Do it at home with a pencil.

874
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:37,989
LAURA: It's satisfying, I think.

875
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:40,878
LIAM: You gave me that mirror.

876
01:10:40,878 --> 01:10:42,219
TALIESIN: Oh no.

877
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:54,768
LAURA: "With the death of the final--" That's just
scary. Don't do this. "With the death of the final

878
01:10:54,768 --> 01:10:58,222
"member of the Chroma Conclave, it brings this
wonderful project and my own adventure to a close.

879
01:10:58,222 --> 01:11:02,250
"It has a been a truly incredible experience to be
able to share my sister's and my talents with you

880
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,940
"all, and with the amazing Critters. We now embark
to find our next project and see where that will

881
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:11,681
"take us. If I could make one request: when you get
all of the mounts hung, could you get us a picture

882
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:15,215
"of the set, please? That would make me and my
sister two very happy Critters."

883
01:11:15,215 --> 01:11:23,077
MATT: Oh, don't worry. I love in the back it's
written here "HDYWTDT, Kerrek, 1-27-2017". They

884
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:28,197
signed it. "They have weathered the Iron Storm,
starved the Hope Devourer, thawed the Frigid Doom,

885
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:33,049
"eradicated the Diseased Deceiver, and extinguished
the Cinder King. They are Vox Machina."

01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:38,026
(cheering)

887
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:43,616
LAURA: Also says, "Liam, the offer still stands."
Do you know what this is? "If you or your kids

888
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:48,781
"would like a custom trophy mount to commemorate
their victory over a mighty foe", they'd be happy

889
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:50,020
to send one your way.

890
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,470
LIAM: Oh, wow. I'll take that.

891
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:55,688
MATT: You were my favorite villains.

892
01:11:55,688 --> 01:11:58,045
TALIESIN: So far.

893
01:11:58,045 --> 01:12:00,723
MATT: I was hoping you'd live until the next
campaign.

894
01:12:00,723 --> 01:12:03,085
LAURA: Oh, too bad Vox Machina killed you.

895
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:06,303
MATT: Yeah. That's okay. It was a fitting end.

896
01:12:06,303 --> 01:12:07,810
LIAM: We saved thousands.

897
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:13,953
MATT: You did in the long run. How cool is that?
Check it out.

898
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:15,189
LAURA: How heavy is it?

899
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:18,578
MATT: It's pretty light, actually. Thordak's the
big, heavy one, as it should be.

900
01:12:18,578 --> 01:12:21,156
MARISHA: I love that they're all kind of to scale
based on--

901
01:12:21,156 --> 01:12:24,389
LAURA: Wow, I can't wait to see all of them hung
up next to each other.

902
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:30,264
LIAM: Also, I can't wait, I hope to live to see
that after civilization falls and you guys trick

903
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:33,571
out your Mad Max car with five dragon heads on
it.

904
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,035
MATT: Don't you even worry.

905
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:38,725
LAURA: I feel like these are just too fragile to
be in a car fight.

906
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:44,104
LIAM: Well, if we all have shotguns, we'll keep
the attackers away.

907
01:12:44,104 --> 01:12:46,433
MATT: We're not fighting with the dragon heads,
they're just intimidation tactics.

908
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:49,313
LAURA: No, but I'm saying if they're hanging on
the front of your Mad Max car, they're going to

909
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,743
get damaged!

910
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:53,342
MATT: Yeah. We'll figure it out.

911
01:12:53,342 --> 01:12:54,992
LIAM: Yeah, but they'll be witnessed.

912
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:59,365
LAURA: They will be witnessed. Witness me!

913
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:02,511
MATT: Oh, is this something?

914
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,341
LAURA: Where should I put this so it doesn't get
damaged?

915
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:07,033
OFF-SCREEN: I think that should go on the set.

916
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:08,933
TALIESIN: Actually--

917
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:15,479
MATT: Well, no, I'm thinking, now that we have all
the heads and if we get the new set finished, we

918
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:17,063
might put them all up in the new set.

919
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:19,893
TALIESIN: We've got the wall as well.

920
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:22,663
MARISHA: We've got new flats coming.

921
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:23,925
LAURA: Oh my gosh, yeah.

922
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:26,163
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a lot of new space for
art.

923
01:13:26,163 --> 01:13:29,921
MATT: Marisha.

924
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:38,749
MARISHA: I think we've hinted at it. We just don't
know exactly when we're going to--

925
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:43,104
MATT: "Hey, Marisha and Matt, congrats on your
engagement. Couldn't be happier for the two of

926
01:13:43,104 --> 01:13:47,629
"you. Here's a gift to commemorate the occasion.
Hope you enjoy it. All the best, your friendly

"neighborhood Bonertown."

928
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:50,990
ALL: Bonertown!

929
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:55,654
MARISHA: Where has he been? I'm sure he's still
been around, I just feel like I haven't heard of

930
01:13:55,654 --> 01:13:57,343
Bonertown in a while.

931
01:13:57,343 --> 01:14:04,583
MATT: Right there should be fine. Oh. What!

932
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,724
TALIESIN: This is going to be a two-person job,
isn't it?

933
01:14:06,724 --> 01:14:11,064
MATT: Marisha. Marisha.

934
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:12,897
MARISHA: What?!

935
01:14:12,897 --> 01:14:16,910
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

936
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:23,548
MATT: Turn that to the camera. That is
incredible.

937
01:14:23,548 --> 01:14:25,623
MARISHA: I already know where that's going.

938
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:27,745
TALIESIN: The gold foil ink is nuts.

939
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:37,545
LAURA: This is super limited printing, by the way.
132/175.

940
01:14:37,545 --> 01:14:49,666
MARISHA: Bonertown! Oh my god. You guys.

941
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:52,854
LAURA: You made sure the tape on that side didn't
touch the picture, right?

942
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:55,024
TALIESIN: No, I'm pretty sure.

943
01:14:55,024 --> 01:15:01,689
LAURA: There's tape on that side of the paper.
Yeah, let's just keep that away from it.

944
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:06,194
MARISHA: Holy crap.

945
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:08,281
LAURA: We're good.

946
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:11,065
MARISHA: Is that everything?

947
01:15:11,065 --> 01:15:12,883
LIAM: I've got a couple things over here.

948
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:20,986
TALIESIN: There's also this. I want to put this
somewhere super safe.

949
01:15:20,986 --> 01:15:34,745
MATT: "To Critical Role, from Kyle Jackson."
(laughs) Yes!

950
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:36,286
LAURA: Stop hogging the joke!

951
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:46,436
MATT: We have an updated one. "Mercer &amp; Four Eyes
&amp; Antlers &amp; Taryon Darrington &amp; Doty &amp; Short Stuff

952
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:53,596
"&amp; Jumbo &amp; Little Elf Boy &amp; Little Elf Girl &amp;
Friendly Bear." That is brilliant. Well, I'm

953
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:55,250
wearing that on Thursday.

954
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,372
LAURA: That would be great, because you need to
get back at Sam for something.

955
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:03,189
MATT: You know what? When I find time, I'm going
to get him back so hard.

956
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:08,255
TALIESIN: Everyone, don't tweet at him. Don't
tweet at Sam, he doesn't have to know.

957
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:12,916
MATT: This is a precursor. This is an accidental
venture. I have things planned.

958
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:23,341
LIAM: I have a big page of limericks and some
gifts from Adam Schwartz, Tiamat_ZX, who I see

959
01:16:23,341 --> 01:16:29,266
active on Twitter. He's sent us a big page of
limericks. I'm going to read two, because there's

960
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:35,612
a lot. Let's do both of Sam's. "Oh Scanlan he
could lie and deceive/But when alone his mother he

961
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:41,687
"would grieve/He never showed his true colors/To
himself nor the others/But by the time they knew,

962
01:16:41,687 --> 01:16:48,200
"he'd made his leave." Too soon. "If you've heard
of Tary the daring/Then you know he is quite

963
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,098
"overbearing/He's naive and a fool/But he's skilled
with a tool/And his compassion is not a red

964
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:54,117
"herring."

965
01:16:54,117 --> 01:16:55,628
ALL: Aww.

966
01:16:55,628 --> 01:17:04,360
LIAM: And he sent along two Dungeons and Dragons
Kre-O sets that I am commandeering for Sam and my

967
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,505
children. Thank you, thank you!

968
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:11,212
MARISHA: Those are cool! I didn't know they made
Lego sets.

969
01:17:11,212 --> 01:17:14,302
LIAM: Well, it's not Lego, it's Kre-O.

970
01:17:14,302 --> 01:17:17,973
MARISHA: Those are pretty cool.

971
01:17:17,973 --> 01:17:24,922
TALIESIN: It's Lego-adjacent. Oh, it has a little
catapult, look at that. And tiny fish, which I

972
01:17:24,922 --> 01:17:26,801
don't understand but I'm excited for.

973
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:28,862
(laughter)

974
01:17:28,862 --> 01:17:33,553
TALIESIN: Comes with catapult, goblet, and tiny
fish.

975
01:17:33,553 --> 01:17:36,047
MARISHA: Does it say 'tiny fish'?

976
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:37,602
TALIESIN: No, it's just there.

977
01:17:37,602 --> 01:17:41,219
LIAM: You know, the Hobbit Lego, Gollum comes with
tiny fish.

978
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:42,650
TALIESIN: Does this one come with tiny fish?

979
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,383
LIAM: I don't know, but if it doesn't, I don't
want it.

980
01:17:44,383 --> 01:17:47,073
MARISHA: Okay, well, Sam's kids can have that
one.

981
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:51,561
TALIESIN: This one comes with far more traditional
fare. No tiny fish.

982
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:55,634
(laughter)

983
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,204
MARISHA: I don't understand.

984
01:17:57,204 --> 01:18:00,913
TALIESIN: It comes with a treasure chest with keys
and gold coins and another catapult and a spider,

985
01:18:00,913 --> 01:18:02,044
but no tiny fish.

986
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,889
MARISHA: Okay, I think we have one more over
there.

987
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:05,344
LIAM: I've got another one over here.

988
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:06,722
TALIESIN: We're reaching the end, though.

989
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:08,593
MARISHA: That one, and then I think that one's the
last one.

990
01:18:08,593 --> 01:18:09,974
MATT: This one here?

991
01:18:09,974 --> 01:18:13,495
LIAM: This sounds like dice. It's dice!

992
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:15,509
LAURA: Give it all to me!

993
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:20,750
LIAM: No. "To Vex and Vax", "To the wonderful cast
of Critical Role." You read the one to the twins

994
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,555
and I'll read the one to the cast of Critical Role.

995
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:23,819
LAURA: Okie-dokie.

996
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:40,954
LIAM: Who's it from? Joshua Green. Does it say to
keep private? I don't know. Australia. Okay.

997
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:47,190
TALIESIN: Lot of Australia. What's going on down
there?

998
01:18:47,190 --> 01:19:01,339
LAURA: Oh, this is literally-- this is to Vex and
Vax, from your aasimar childhood friend, Velandris

999
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:18,446
Dawncollar. I remember him. That's awesome! Oh no.
"By the way, I need your help, Vex and Vax, and the

1000
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:23,218
"help of the rest of Vox Machina, and if you come
across any vampires, put a few down for me, and I

1001
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:30,337
"hate those mockeries of living." You got it,
Velandris Dawncollar.

1002
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,723
MATT: That's awesome.

1003
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:34,820
LAURA: That's so cool.

1004
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:42,158
LIAM: One of these-- there's four sets of dice in here.
I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Oh my

1005
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:50,978
gosh. What the hell is going on? The green swirl
dice. Green swirl dice? Yeah, that says Kiki.

1006
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:56,905
MARISHA: Oh yeah, these are cool.

1007
01:19:56,905 --> 01:20:08,815
LIAM: This also says Kiki, so that goes to Marisha
as well. Laura gets the pink one. Oh, I get none

1008
01:20:08,815 --> 01:20:12,170
of these. Pass this down to Laura and this to
Matt.

1009
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:17,305
LAURA: Ooh, these are pretty. I don't have any
blue this color.

1010
01:20:17,305 --> 01:20:20,661
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Lord Fourth Wall.

1011
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:28,016
LAURA: Okay, these are actually really pretty blue
dice. I've never seen any like that.

1012
01:20:28,016 --> 01:20:30,416
MATT: Mine's Creamsicle!

1013
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:32,806
LIAM: Yeah, but what color is your die?

1014
01:20:32,806 --> 01:20:35,095
MARISHA: Mine's got a little brown in it.

1015
01:20:35,095 --> 01:20:44,691
LAURA: I have to roll. 18!

1016
01:20:44,691 --> 01:20:46,333
LIAM: Thank you, Joshua.

1017
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,835
MATT: Thank you so much!

1018
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:53,656
LAURA: I'm going to go put it with my dice.

1019
01:20:53,656 --> 01:21:04,997
MATT: This here is from Scott Ismael. All right.

1020
01:21:04,997 --> 01:21:07,453
MARISHA: Do you need assistance?

1021
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:10,898
MATT: Maybe. It's big things.

1022
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:15,085
MARISHA: Oh, jeez Louise, you guys.

1023
01:21:15,085 --> 01:21:18,146
MATT: Oh my god.

1024
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:20,339
MARISHA: Get out of here, cardboard.

1025
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:22,267
MATT: Go, box. Go.

1026
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:32,039
MARISHA: No advertisement for Scotch! No! None for
you!

1027
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,826
(laughter)

1028
01:21:34,826 --> 01:21:39,798
MATT: That's my girl. Not today, not tomorrow, not
ever!

1029
01:21:39,798 --> 01:21:42,467
LIAM: Oh no, Scotch Tape just unfollowed us.

1030
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:51,057
MATT: Wow. Wow!

1031
01:21:51,057 --> 01:22:00,729
ALL: Whoa!

1032
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:05,853
MATT: That's badass.

1033
01:22:05,853 --> 01:22:10,337
TALIESIN: We just need him to build a full wall of
art, now.

1034
01:22:10,337 --> 01:22:15,296
LAURA: We can make a gallery wall. I love gallery
walls.

1035
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:18,287
TALIESIN: All those Batman posters in the
hallway.

1036
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:25,608
MARISHA: Yeah! We have a bunch of movie posters in
the studio that we didn't make.

1037
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:29,640
TALIESIN: They magically vanish over the next 72
hours. That could happen.

1038
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:38,068
MARISHA: We should have a gallery wall. You're
really good at it! Just put Laura on it.

1039
01:22:38,068 --> 01:22:39,718
TALIESIN: All right, I'm down.

1040
01:22:39,718 --> 01:22:44,038
LIAM: Laura is the physical reincarnation of Pinterest.

1041
01:22:44,038 --> 01:22:53,519
MATT: Scott, this is amazing. And a perfect
example that there are many if not all crafts that

1042
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:59,654
are artistic in their own way. This is a brilliant
piece of woodworking, and I am honored. That is

1043
01:22:59,654 --> 01:23:01,008
fantastic.

1044
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:02,003
MARISHA: He made that?

1045
01:23:02,003 --> 01:23:03,236
MATT: He made that, yeah.

1046
01:23:03,236 --> 01:23:06,028
LAURA: Does it say what kind of woods it is?

1047
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:14,759
MATT: I don't know. I will look back in the paper.
He does not say.

1048
01:23:14,759 --> 01:23:16,791
LAURA: It's beautiful.

1049
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:28,822
MATT: Don't neglect the brain. Thank you so much.
That's amazing.

1050
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:33,549
MARISHA: Well, that's Critmas in May, you guys.

1051
01:23:33,549 --> 01:23:37,507
LAURA: Thanks for joining us for another
exciting episode of Talks Machina.

1052
01:23:37,507 --> 01:23:39,330
(cheering)

1053
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,859
MARISHA: Yay, we did it!

1054
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:47,069
TALIESIN: And if you didn't see your package on
air, it's entirely possible that we did get it.

1055
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:53,090
Packages are not necessarily opened in the order
that they are received, nor are they received in

1056
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,620
the order that they were sent, nor were they
necessarily sent in a way that actually was

1057
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:02,546
received by us. We have them. We've possibly
opened them. We're pretty sure we have them. We

1058
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:06,116
don't open everything on air, so it's entirely
possible that we did get it, just because

1059
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:11,450
sometimes we see a package and get curious. Like a
small woodland creature.

1060
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:14,353
MATT: Or it says, "Open now or you will be cursed
for seven years."

1061
01:24:14,353 --> 01:24:17,479
LIAM: Or the PO box office says, "Get your ass
over here, god damn it."

1062
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:19,120
TALIESIN: Yeah, they yell at us.

1063
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,519
LIAM: "What's wrong with you people?"

1064
01:24:20,519 --> 01:24:24,107
MARISHA: And as always, we definitely implore you
guys to go check out the Critters' Guide to

1065
01:24:24,107 --> 01:24:29,981
Critmas, if you want to be involved. Check that
out first, because there's a lot of great

1066
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:38,720
charities that we definitely love you guys to
check out and consider donating to, because giving

1067
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,590
is fun and nice and makes you happy and feel
good.

1068
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,460
LIAM: And please give to the Planetary Society
before our planet implodes.

1069
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,490
TALIESIN: And 826LA, as always, and First Place
for Youth.

1070
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,881
MATT: First Book, Nature Conservatory.

1071
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,190
LAURA: My Friend's Place.

1072
01:24:56,190 --> 01:25:04,016
MARISHA: What was Sam's? Oh, Pablove. Yeah,
there's a lot of great charities that we love and

1073
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:12,571
support. So yeah, don't feel like you have to buy
us stuff to still experience the joy of Critmas.

1074
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:16,532
MATT: Nope. In fact, few things bring us more
pride than the fact that you guys are giving back

1075
01:25:16,532 --> 01:25:21,653
to the world and helping those who could use help
in many different facets in the name of nerdy

1076
01:25:21,653 --> 01:25:23,121
roleplaying games.

1077
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:29,301
MARISHA: Yes, and we always read you guys' letters
where you talk about running games in schools and

1078
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:36,468
libraries and stuff that you guys are doing. We
read it all, we have a big notebook that we keep in--

1079
01:25:36,468 --> 01:25:37,921
MATT: Multiple notebooks.

1080
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:40,232
TALIESIN: It used to be a notebook. It's not a
notebook anymore.

1081
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:47,272
MARISHA: We keep all of the fan letters, so know
that even if we don't say out loud, we keep and

1082
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:48,399
read all of them.

1083
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:50,960
TALIESIN: You all have excellent handwriting. It's
actually very impressive.

1084
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,612
MATT: Yeah! It makes me very self-conscious about
my handwriting.

1085
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,711
TALIESIN: Very self-conscious about my handwriting
thanks to the fandom here.

1086
01:25:56,711 --> 01:26:00,442
LIAM: You can keep sending pegasi to Laura Bailey,
though.

1087
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:03,441
LAURA: I will gladly accept.

1088
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:05,282
TALIESIN: Cue all the pegasi.

1089
01:26:05,282 --> 01:26:07,402
MARISHA: And amazing crocheted goods.

1090
01:26:07,402 --> 01:26:11,549
MATT: Thank you guys so much! You're amazing.

1091
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:18,318
MARISHA: This is amazing. What does Brian always
say? Oh, and as always, it's almost Thursday.

1092
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:21,168
MATT: Oh, I've got to prepare.

1093
01:26:21,168 --> 01:26:41,005
