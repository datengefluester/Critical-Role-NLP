NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.127
OFF-SCREEN: Zac, [inaudible]?

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:02.954
ZAC: Yeah, dude.

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:03.914
OFF-SCREEN: See you dude, thank you very much!

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:15.814
ZAC: Later, bud! Bye! Cool. What’s up, everybody?
We’re going to do a little bit of Periscoping of

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:20.831
the setup for the show. Maybe when I switch back
the focus will actually work on the camera.

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:22.574
MATT: Hi, guys!

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:27.860
ZAC: We haven’t shown you guys in a while how we
set things up and all the stuff you’ve been

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.633
getting for us and how we utilize that. We’ve been
doing a lot of lighting stuff. You can see here,

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:40.496
this is some of the colored lights you guys have
bought. Right there. We’ve got the mood lights

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:47.008
behind Matt now, which are down here. Okay. These
are all the Philips hue bulbs that you guys have

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:56.176
been helping us out with that allow us to also change
colors on the fly. It might be a little while

00:00:56.176 --> 00:01:03.874
before we get a system down that we really like.
We’ve got some more down here. Hidden around the

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:08.621
set. What eventually we’ll be able to do is
control lighting based on the mood of what’s

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:15.603
happening in the show, so we can do subtle gradient
changes of things as things get more intense.

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:23.134
Stuff like that. We’ve got the hues set up
throughout there. Our mic setup for this show is

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:30.133
pretty intense. We’ve got the six mics on the
side. Then we’ve got the two mics on Matt. One in

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:39.131
case he stands up, another on the table. Do do do
do! Let’s see what else we have back here. Oh.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:44.500
Should probably show you guys what Critmas looks
like around here. Actually, it’s a lot more

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.442
condensed now because they’ve been preparing for
it.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:49.966
LAURA: (shrieking) Oh my gosh!

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:59.046
ZAC: Oh my god. We’re going to-- there’s so much stuff.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:02.286
LAURA: This is the best thing ever!

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:13.063
ZAC: So guys, you fill up our studio with stuff.
Like, a lot of stuff. A lot of people also send

00:02:13.063 --> 00:02:17.533
stuff to us at Geek &amp; Sundry for the Twitch
channel to help things run well. That’s all stuff

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:23.417
that’s been organized that we use from show to
show and for Critical Role. Yeah. All those boxes

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:32.226
you saw are for Critmas. It’s all crazy stuff. 
I’m not going to reveal what Laura’s doing right now.

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.286
We’ll let you guys see that later.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.737
LAURA: Wait, are you Periscoping?

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:36.636
ZAC: Yeah!

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:39.138
LAURA: But they want to see it! Don’t they want to
see it?!

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:43.108
ZAC: Okay, fine! Okay. Laura found a new friend.

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:54.957
LAURA: Oh, well, this is early Critmas because
it’s so big. So it’s Trinket! Look at him! He’s

00:02:54.957 --> 00:03:02.495
everything I ever dreamed of. I’ve just been
hugging him for about five minutes now.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:09.940
ZAC: You’re coming by tomorrow for the World of
War-- sorry, Warcraft. I keep calling it World of

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.620
Warcraft and I’m going to get fired if I keep that
up. It’s just Warcraft movie. Laura and Travis are

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.632
going to come by tomorrow.

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.920
LAURA: I don’t even know if they realize that
we're voice actors for it.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.791
ZAC: In the movie?

00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.827
LAURA: No! Just in the game!

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:27.620
ZAC: Yeah. I think they do, since we suggested you
guys come by.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.217
LAURA: Oh, you! He’s so adorable! Where is he
going to hang out?

00:03:34.217 --> 00:03:39.217
ZAC: I don’t fucking know! Where’s all this stuff
going to hang out?! Are you serious?

00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:40.330
LAURA: Hi, buddy!

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.767
ZAC: I’m excited that you guys are finally opening
all these boxes because this is what our fucking

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:46.746
studio looks like all week.

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:52.252
LAURA: He’s so soft and pettable, too! Seriously,
do you want to hang out with Trinket for the rest

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:56.988
of the night? Would it be weird if I didn’t play
and I just hung out right here?

00:03:56.988 --> 00:03:59.147
RYAN: I’ll just put him right behind you.

00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:01.612
ZAC: I wouldn’t feel bad.

00:04:01.612 --> 00:04:06.947
LAURA: Hi, guys.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.779
ZAC: Should we put him in the corner?

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.287
LAURA: Yeah! Put them both! Is it weird to have
double Trinkets?

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:13.867
ZAC: Oh, we’re not putting both; there’s no room.

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:16.269
LAURA: Wait, why is his armor off?

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.246
ZAC: Because it’s being finished. The armor’s
being finished. Go ahead and throw this one on

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:24.178
set. Have fun with that. Okay. There we go.

00:04:24.178 --> 00:04:26.859
LAURA: Come on, Trinket! I’m going to trip.

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:28.439
RYAN: Please don’t.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.651
LAURA: Oh no!

00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:37.251
ZAC: Guys, these are our giveaway towers, just so
you know. She asked me. She told me, dude! I was

00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:40.168
hiding it and she was like, “No, come show it!"
That’s all on her.

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:43.552
LAURA: I’m sorry! He’s going to stand behind me!

00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:47.031
ZAC: Guys, these are all the giveaways we have.

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:51.721
That we give away throughout the week. All of our comic books and

00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:58.413
stuff here. We have all of our board games, other
stuff. All sorts of stuff. Heroclix giveaways,

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:11.441
Critical Role giveaways. All the stuff. More back
here stuff. That’s all my secret stash of stuff

00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:12.730
that nobody’s allowed to touch.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.156
LAURA: Look at him!

00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:16.114
ZAC: Oh, I meant the other side.

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:16.995
LAURA: No!

00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:18.834
LIAM: She wants him close behind her.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:23.765
ZAC: Okay. I’m going to have to put my foot down
on there because now you have a really busy

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:26.435
background on one side and absolutely nothing on
the other.

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:30.006
LAURA: But how will I hug him if he’s all the way
on the other side?

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.324
ZAC: I don’t know. How’d you do it with the other
one all the way on the other side?

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:37.736
LAURA: You’re right. But he’ll be out of frame
because he’s tall.

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:48.626
ZAC: If he’s all the way in the corner, you
should be okay. Do you want to switch him?

00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:51.296
The more we can get him into the corner, the more on-camera he’ll be.

00:05:51.296 --> 00:05:53.556
The closer he is to you guys, the more off-camera he’ll be.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:57.356
LAURA: He can go to the other side. No, that's a big pain.

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:00.394
ZAC: I like that the bear decided to respect our flooring.

00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:03.188
RYAN: Little booties.

00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:07.288
ZAC: Thanks for that. I’m glad the bear came
prepared for the green cyc. It’s really nice.

00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:10.659
LAURA: I’ve got it.

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.201
LUCAS: Matt, is there anything special I need to
know?

00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.465
MATT: You’re beautiful.

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:19.192
LUCAS: All right!

00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:22.322
ZAC: This is a show in itself.

00:06:22.322 --> 00:06:25.133
LAURA: I don’t want him to burn alive!

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.526
ZAC: That’s an LED light. We’re good.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:28.773
LAURA: That’s where he goes.

00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:32.172
ZAC: We’ll check that out.

00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:36.966
LAURA: Look at him! Oh! He’s so cute!

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:47.133
ZAC: God. Here’s a close up on that badass dragon,
guys, which is pretty rad.

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:53.324
RYAN: The bear is half in the frame.

00:06:53.324 --> 00:06:55.164
ZAC: Can we get these candles turned on?

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.046
RYAN: All the batteries are dead.

00:06:57.046 --> 00:07:01.346
ZAC: Then grab the three candles that are
rechargeable from over there and put them back here.

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:07.359
These are also Philips candles that you guys
sent us that we want to eventually use

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.794
all of these because they’re much nicer and
they’re rechargeable, which will

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:15.361
save us a lot of money in the long run. These are
really cool. Check these out. They actually look

00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:20.493
really nice. You turn them off. Turn them on! It’s
pretty dope.

00:07:20.493 --> 00:07:22.273
TRAVIS: I’ve got a chicken question for you.

00:07:22.273 --> 00:07:23.382
ZAC: Nope.

00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:27.163
TRAVIS: Yep. It’s for you. Just need to know the
name of the place.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:29.698
ZAC: Bravo Chicken.

00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:32.654
LIAM: We don’t know who sent the bear probably
because we were so overwhelmed.

00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:37.138
ZAC: Okay, guys, they don’t know who sent the
bear, so I’m going to put it on you Critters and

00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:39.578
Team Hooman to find for us who sent the bear.

00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:44.378
LIAM: So that we can thank you. We’ve got four
hours to find that out. I’m sure we can do it.

00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:52.855
ZAC: Yeah. So let us know. DM us. Let us know who
sent the bear. Let’s see the rest of this place.

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:56.611
MARISHA: Hi Zac!

00:07:56.611 --> 00:08:02.702
ZAC: What’s up? This is our lighting rig, by the
way. It's not very well put together because Lucas

00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:18.578
and I did it. Look at this mess! All going up to
our very cheap set. This is Lucas’ setup, so you

00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:26.202
guys see what he sees. That’s a lot of layers.
Yeah, Bravo Chicken. These are our layers.

00:08:26.202 --> 00:08:28.701
Lucas is clicking things to look like he’s doing stuff.

00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.402
LUCAS: The files are in the computer!

00:08:37.112 --> 00:08:45.951
ZAC: We have our setup here. You can see we
duplicate this for No Survivors on Monday nights.

00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:53.919
Then I’ve got a closeup right here of the close up
camera so I know when I need to run out there

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:58.231
really quick and fix it. This is also what I’ve
been working on is getting the stuff ready for

00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:11.211
Warcraft tomorrow. We have to do a lot with a
small team. Always moving and shaking. It’s not

00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:19.200
starting late tonight. For all you guys in Europe:
we have Daylight Savings Time over here. We didn’t

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.499
think to even tell everybody about that.

00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:23.652
LIAM: All day.

00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:24.886
SAM: It is cooler.

00:09:24.886 --> 00:09:31.919
ZAC: We’ve got our two cameras here, guys. What
we do in program is we manipulate the image so we

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:36.070
cut it in half and crop it. We send each of these
inputs into--

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.678
MARISHA: (gasps) Ooh!

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.545
LAURA: I know, right? Do you want to show these on
the--

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.862
ZAC: Save it, dude!

00:09:41.862 --> 00:09:43.248
LAURA: All right.

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:50.061
ZAC: We crop both inputs that run into the
computer. It’s kind of jambled up, the way we do

00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:59.981
it, because we have, up here, our SDI connector
for the Black Magic. The only camera actually

00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:05.559
running through that for this show is Matt’s
camera that’s a close up on him. Everything else

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:10.011
is going through our switchers up to the top and
then back around. Each camera goes into a separate

00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:16.629
input. We have an SDI to HDI converter on each
line, that way we can crop it in the program. If we

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:22.800
try to crop it within Black Magic, it doesn’t
allow us for fast enough switching and it can

00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:31.134
cause some problems with latency. So we do it all
within the computer within wire cast. That’s how

00:10:31.134 --> 00:10:36.712
we do that. You can see we have all our audio
cables running in here with a bunch of extra lines

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:43.243
that we switch, depending on the show. This is our 
upstage/downstage controller support. Yeah,

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:52.507
it’s a lot of stuff. We had to optimize everything
for a two-person team, which was really tough.

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:54.347
That noise?

00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:56.239
MARISHA: Do you hear it?

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:04.609
ZAC: I did hear it. It did come out of the Beats.
The Beats are low on power. No, they’re not. I

00:11:04.609 --> 00:11:08.714
think it’s just-- they’re not. They’re plugged in.
I think the power just got bumped.

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:14.487
TRAVIS: Bravo Chicken and Pizza on GrubHub?

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:20.097
ZAC: Yeah, Bravo Chicken and Pizza, I think. If you
search on GrubHub for fried chicken, it’ll come up.

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:24.757
MATT: That’s awesome! I haven't been able
to actually hold it in-person yet.

00:11:24.772 --> 00:11:30.459
ZAC: Basically, guys, the reason we have a lot of
things set up the way we do is, as a two-person

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:36.034
team with a PA, we had to maneuver everything to
work in a way where the least amount of hands

00:11:36.034 --> 00:11:42.917
could get the most amount of work done. Which
looks like a rat’s nest, and I understand that,

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.015
but we know what it all is, and we get it.

00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:46.218
MARISHA: They’re cool!

00:11:46.218 --> 00:11:48.265
TALIESIN: Oh wow!

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:53.538
ZAC: Coming up here real soon, guys, if you guys
didn’t see on our Amazon wish list, we put some

00:11:53.538 --> 00:12:01.208
things on there that were camera attachments and
stuff. Why we’re doing that is we want to start

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:08.758
hanging-- sorry-- this camera from the ceiling. So
we have a top-down view of the map, and then we’re

00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:17.463
going to have a TV on the wall up here so our
players back here can see what’s on the map. Up on

00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:25.159
the TV, and then we’ll do an HDMI duplicator into
our board for all that good stuff. Hard to hear?

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:33.168
Sorry about that, guys. Basically, right now,
we’re doing a 45 degree angle down, but we’re

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:36.863
going to be fixing that soon and you guys have
pretty much gotten everything off of the wish list

00:12:36.863 --> 00:12:42.445
that we need to do that. So by next Thursday,
we should have the top-down camera ready.

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:47.748
MATT: It’s going to be awesome! I’m so excited!
I’m so excited to have that! That way, the players

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:49.865
can see actually themselves easily on the
battlefield.

00:12:49.865 --> 00:12:52.195
ZAC: I might have to buy a bigger TV.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:13:01.224
ZAC: Yeah, we might have to get a bigger TV. I
brought one home that’s a 27-inch. We’ll see if

00:13:01.224 --> 00:13:02.945
it’s big enough for them to see back from there.

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.767

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:11.207
