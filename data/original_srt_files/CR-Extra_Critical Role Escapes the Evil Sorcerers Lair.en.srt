1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:05,885
Hey, welcome to Escape, the show where we take celebrities, 
lock them in a room and force them to solve complex puzzles

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:08,845
in order to escape before time runs out.

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:12,666
What are the stakes? Well, failing to escape 
will put an intergalactic price on their heads,

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,296
but success will make them the rulers of their own planets.

5
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,516
So you know, six of one, half a dozen of the other.

6
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,805
Please welcome our guest.

7
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:30,475
Now, you might also know him as McCree from Overwatch 
or Levi from Attack on Titan.

8
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:31,775
Please welcome Matt Mercer.

9
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:32,768
MATT: Jumping in--

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,841
JANET: Matt Mercer!

11
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,934
MATT: Apparently that's my intro music.

12
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:35,588
JANET: That's not a theme.

13
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:39,377
I'm Matthew Mercer. Voice actor, 
dungeon master for Critical Role.

14
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:40,755
MATT: Hey, I'm glad I have one at least.

15
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:41,585
JANET: Welcome in.

16
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:42,326
MATT: Thank you.

17
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:45,845
I've heard stories from friends and such, 
but I've only done one escape room challenge

18
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,684
that was a lot of fun.

19
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:47,383
MATT: Thank you for having me.

20
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:48,558
JANET: You don't want to be stuck just with me, right?

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,286
You probably want me to bring out some of your teammates.

22
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:51,207
MATT: If possible.

23
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:52,505
Not that I don't believe in your ability, but--

24
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:55,777
JANET: No, listen. None taken. 
She is Margaret from Persona and

25
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:59,476
host of Super Power Beat Down, 
please welcome Marisha Ray.

26
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,137
Marisha Ray. Marisha Ray. 
You thought it was just for you.

27
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,006
It's not. This is a theme.

28
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:09,606
Hello, my name is Marisha Ray 
and you might know me from Geek & Sundry's Critical Role.

29
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:10,919
JANET: Thanks for coming, nice to see you.

30
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,966
MARISHA: Thanks. I'm here, it's early.

31
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:17,056
JANET: Well you're on Japanese time. 
Sure, sure, sure.

32
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,709
I've actually done one escape room to date. 
It was serial killer themed. And we got so close.

33
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,656
JANET: Now, listen. I'm going to bring them both out at once. 
They're voice actors you might know

34
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:31,697
from Halo 5: Guardians, Avengers Assemble, and tons more. 
Please welcome Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham.

35
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:35,196
Laura Bailey. Travis Willingham.

36
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:40,166
Hi, I'm Laura Bailey. I'm a voice actress 
and I'm on Critical Role,

37
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,520
which, you know, you guys know about.

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,753
JANET: Like me, you probably get stuck 
in the back of all photos

39
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:48,135
so people never see what your body looks like. 
They just see a floating head in the background.

40
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:52,171
My name is Travis Willingham. 
I'm a member of the Critical Role D&D show

41
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,138
on Geek & Sundry's Twitch channel.

42
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:57,757
I have never done any kind of room escape before.

43
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:03,227
I have no experience whatsoever 
so I have no idea what to expect.

44
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,628
JANET: Now we just got some loose clown 
who's along for the ride.

45
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,601
He's one of my favorite people on the planet, 
although I'm not sure why.

46
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:14,164
He's an actor, you know him from Dragonball Z, 
please welcome Christopher Sabat.

47
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,242
Christopher Sabat. Christopher Sabat.

48
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:18,248
LAURA: How's it going?

49
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,571
CHRIS: Good, good.

50
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:25,238
I am Christopher Sabat and I am known for, 
I guess, mostly my work on Dragonball Z. 
I'm the voice of Vegeta.

51
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:26,848
JANET: Thanks for piggybacking.

52
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:29,749
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah. 
You know I'm the biggest fan of Critical Role.

53
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,278
I've seen all their episodes.

54
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,298
LAURA: You haven't seen a single episode, have you?

55
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:37,818
CHRIS: I am gonna catch up one of these days. 
Just gonna binge it.

56
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:40,648
You know, looking at the team I'm probably the strongest. 
Easily.

57
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,788
JANET: I will say about Chris, 
he is one of the warmest,

58
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:47,579
most sincere-- just the kind of person 
that's so cuddly and wonderful.

59
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,538
CHRIS: Thank you.

60
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,370
You know, mentally, look at them.

61
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,736
JANET: And you guys want to know 
what you're looking at?

62
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,609
Where you're gonna be?

63
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:54,860
MATT: Yes, please.

64
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,874
JANET: And what your background mythology is?

65
00:02:56,874 --> 00:03:00,360
You're magicians who find yourself 
in the study of "The Evil Sorcerer."

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,957
You know, "The Evil Sorcerer." Generic fantasy tale. 
And you guys need to work together

67
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:11,528
to get out of the room. You need to-- 
let's see, one was that you grasp

68
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:15,717
and cast the spell to banish him. 
That was a real tongue twister.

69
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,080
MATT: Yeah, well done.

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,407
JANET: You guys are the VO actors, you can handle it. 
I've never done VO.

71
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:23,338
(coughing) Legend of Korra.

72
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,748
MARISHA: ...the spell to banish the evil sorcerer.

73
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:28,750
JANET: Yeah, okay. I think that's it guys. 
I'm going to take you in

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,620
to your wonderful sorcerer's lair. 
Just follow me. Shall we?

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,720
MATT: Oh boy.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,540
TRAVIS: No song as we leave?

77
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,799
LAURA: I thought we were gonna get a theme song.

78
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,639
MARISHA: It's our theme song.

79
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:56,404
LAURA: Oh, no!

80
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,935
JANET: Come on in. Welcome in. 
This is probably a good place to hang

81
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:04,976
to take everything in, right? And that's it. 
I wish I could stay in here with you because

82
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:08,173
this is my favorite room ever 
but instead I'm gonna say: time starts now!

83
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,217
[everyone yelling]

84
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,408
MATT: Okay, uh--!

85
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,858
LAURA: What do we do?!

86
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:14,738
CHRIS: This looks like Laura's bathroom.

87
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,226
CHRIS: I found rabbit's foot.

88
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,736
[MATT, offscreen]: My first thoughts walking into that room were: 
okay, this is my bailiwick.

89
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:22,944
This is my realm of expertise.

90
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:26,713
[MARISHA, offscreen]: This room is so cool! 
I'm hoping they can save the set,

91
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,137
I kind of want those wall sconces.

92
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:32,366
[CHRIS, offscreen]: Well, the first thing that hits me is: 
wait a minute, what am I supposed to be doing in here?

93
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:35,494
TRAVIS: I am instantly confused 
about where to start.

94
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:39,226
MARISHA: Okay, you guys. 
Is there something that's gonna happen?

95
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,095
TRAVIS: So those runes are alphabetical, 
these are also alphabetical.

96
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,718
LAURA: Wait, there's little things. 
That means there's probably cards

97
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,134
or something that go in here.

98
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,175
MARISHA: Okay, good call.

99
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:49,891
[TRAVIS, offscreen]: There's a giant wood structure. 
I see tablets of stone with runes.

100
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:52,258
There's a million different potions.

101
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:58,826
LAURA: I mean, the potions alone, all the ingredients; 
a little overwhelming, but so freaking cool.

102
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,246
MARISHA: Can I just live there? 
I just want to live in the room.

103
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:03,116
Here's a deck of cards.

104
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,294
LAURA: Oh, yeah, where?!

105
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,475
Marisha found the tarot cards.

106
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,694
MARISHA: They're tarot cards.

107
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:10,765
MATT: Tarot cards over here as well.

108
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:15,730
LAURA: But I stole them from her 
very quickly because apparently I do that.

109
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,609
Wait, I'm gonna look and see if I can 
find special-- they're numbered.

110
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:23,447
CHRIS: There's roman numerals on this table.

111
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:28,044
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm gonna translate the alphabet 
and that message that's on the right-hand side.

112
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:31,515
CHRIS: Travis immediately says, "I'm gonna solve this."

113
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:34,065
[TRAVIS, offscreen]: There's three different slabs 
that have got little numbers under them,

114
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:37,166
and then one that I'm like, okay, 
clearly we have to decipher this thing.

115
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,046
So I start looking something to write with 
and I find a piece of parchment

116
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:45,094
and a little quill pen and start 
running back and forth trying to decode the message.

117
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,934
The first one isn't even here!

118
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,364
CHRIS: Have you finished this?

119
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:51,503
TRAVIS: No! I'm just looking for 
the first stupid symbol!

120
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,566
CHRIS: I'm gonna just look at 
things on the shelf.

121
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,343
The first thing I pick up is--

122
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,422
CHRIS: I found a menu for TGI Fridays.

123
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:02,692
--this menu that has the potions in it, 
and nothing makes sense.

124
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,064
MARISHA: Have we looked at this yet?

125
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,464
CHRIS: Okay, what's this?

126
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:06,936
TRAVIS: H, that's an H!

127
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:11,273
MATT: Gift of Flight-- these are 
different potions, possibly?

128
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:14,602
I cannot imagine that all 
of these are gonna be useful.

129
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:20,013
MARISHA: Gifts of Gold, Frigid Fancy.

130
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,562
I'm probably only looking for 
like one or two, aren't I?

131
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:26,794
MARISHA: I said brrr, it's cold in here!

132
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,594
And I think half of them are 
just there to make me look stupid.

133
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,623
MARISHA: There must be some toros 
in the atmosphere.

134
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,493
TRAVIS: I can't believe you actually 
just went to Bring It On.

135
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,653
[laughing]

136
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:39,583
I think the Bring It On spell was just to make us look, 
like, really cool.

137
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,233
You know, I mean if nothing else, 
then at least we've got that.

138
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,904
LAURA: I swear you guys, I'm so lost.

139
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,678
[everyone agreeing]

140
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:48,257
CHRIS: What are we even supposed to be doing here?

141
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,563
TRAVIS: I'm figuring out that message 
and I'm actually having some luck.

142
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:54,474
LAURA: We're trying to gather-- 
we're trying to cast a spell.

143
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:56,111
CHRIS: Do you have a banishment spell somewhere?

144
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,843
MATT: That's what we're trying to see here. So we have--

145
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:04,434
There are a lot of spells. There's a spellbook, 
there's the little sheets of paper that have spells on them.

146
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,204
LAURA: Exploding potion?

147
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:07,813
MATT: For now, let's put these out here.

148
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,162
CHRIS: We can make some of these.

149
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,062
LAURA: We can make an Exploding Potion. Let's look.

150
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:15,615
I immediately start thinking I can make 
an exploding spell, a potion,

151
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,454
that will get us out of the room, like, no problem.

152
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,213
So I start looking for ingredients 
to make an Exploding Potion,

153
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:24,033
which is probably the wrong idea.

154
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,443
TRAVIS: "The magician"!

155
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:26,651
CHRIS: One head of garlic.

156
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:28,096
LAURA: There's probably a magician in here.

157
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,655
TRAVIS: "The magician" is the first part of this thing.

158
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:32,134
MARISHA: The magician? Okay.

159
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,621
CHRIS: Wow, Travis. You're on top of it.

160
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:41,736
Then as he starts saying the words he says 
"magician" and we realize, that's one of the tarot cards!

161
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:46,394
So I'm going to try and separate those out. 
That way as soon as we have this riddle done,

162
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,970
hopefully we won't be searching 
through an entire deck of cards.

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,001
TRAVIS: This is going to be the 
greatest moment of my life.

164
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,139
LAURA: Is there head of garlic over there?

165
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,775
CHRIS: You're just gonna make a random spell, huh?

166
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,571
LAURA: It's an exploding one, 
it'll get us out of here.

167
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:58,710
CHRIS: Okay, cool!

168
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,930
TRAVIS: There are numbers?!

169
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,451
MARISHA: Head of garlic?

170
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,367
TRAVIS: What kind of an asshole 
puts numbers with runes?

171
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:06,995
O.

172
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:13,025
MARISHA: Here's a-- what is this, you guys? 
This has a little-- this does that. That does that.

173
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:13,910
CHRIS: That does that?

174
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,430
MARISHA: That looks important, right?

175
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,444
CHRIS: Yeah, there's another thing 
that should do that but you can't pull it out.

176
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:22,235
TRAVIS: "Fought," maybe? Is that a "fought"?

177
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,544
MARISHA: Is there anything on the bottom of that, Chris?

178
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,955
LAURA: Wait, elixir seven.

179
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:30,107
TRAVIS: "Sought"! You piece of--

180
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:33,175
LAURA: Elixir seven. This one's important.

181
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:36,533
CHRIS: I have a feeling what Travis is doing here 
is probably the most important thing

182
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,720
'cause it seems like it's the start.

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,624
MARISHA: While he's got that goin', 
here's the magician.

184
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,005
CHRIS: What do you need?

185
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,366
We hear the announcement that we only have 
25 minutes left.

186
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,814
That is when my stomach sinks very heavily.

187
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,015
MARISHA: We haven't done shit!

188
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,165
LAURA: We haven't done anything!

189
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,125
That is when I realized we might be in trouble.

190
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,663
LAURA: Oh no! What if we all just die right now?!

191
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,955
CHRIS: Guys, let's help Travis do this.

192
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,034
LAURA: What is he doing?

193
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:01,922
CHRIS: "B."

194
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,080
TRAVIS: What's a "K"? Find me a "K".

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,415
CHRIS: A "K"?

196
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,595
TRAVIS: Yeah, a "K" symbol.

197
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,632
CHRIS: "K" symbol is, uh--

198
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:11,955
K symbol is an "I". What's the next one?

199
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:17,276
TRAVIS: I've got a "U," "S,"-- 
this is a-- I think that's a "T".

200
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:22,104
And then Marisha finds these spells that are, 
you know, singing, and so we start chanting.

201
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:29,816
MARISHA AND LAURA: Boredas stupificus, 
boredas stupificus, boredas stupificus.

202
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:34,758
That's gotta mean "I'm really stupid" 
in Latin that you made us repeat over and over again.

203
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,556
MARISHA AND LAURA: Boredas stupificus.

204
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:37,976
It's gonna live forever on the internet.

205
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,485
LAURA: How many times-- boredas stupificus.

206
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:42,177
[continue chanting]

207
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,107
That's cool. Thanks guys. Thanks.

208
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:45,955
MARISHA: Is this just a spell to make us look stupid?

209
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:46,976
CHRIS: What do we have so far?

210
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,448
TRAVIS: Is that a "JU-" I think that's "justice"?

211
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,011
CHRIS: Okay, "justice," right.

212
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,421
TRAVIS: "The magician sought justice"--

213
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:57,760
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm guessing some of 
these potions are just red herrings?

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,022
TRAVIS: This quill is not-- 
it's magically losing ink!

215
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,501
Come back to life. I got it, I got it!

216
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:11,299
TRAVIS: "The magician sought justice" 
on or in something.

217
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,119
MARISHA: To restore your wand 
to its former might, one must--

218
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,390
MATT: Hey guys, we're pushing the 20 minutes.

219
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,879
We reached a point where we had been 
running around, floundering.

220
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,518
We found a lot of pieces to things 
that we didn't quite know how they fit together.

221
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:23,720
LAURA: We're taking so long 
on the very first clue.

222
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,280
We need to have the helping hand.

223
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,369
MATT: We're floundering a little bit here. 
Do we want to go ahead and try and

224
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,744
at least get a helping hand 
to maybe get on the right path?

225
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:35,480
Knowing that we could continue to do this 
for next 15 minutes if we aren't careful,

226
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,418
I think we all began to realize that 
it's best to just use this helping hand now.

227
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,370
ALL: Helping hand!

228
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,919
JANET: Okay, wizard wannabes. 
Here's your rhyming helping hand.

229
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:54,259
MARISHA: Oh my god, we suck so hard!

230
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,930
TRAVIS: Oh, "W," that would make sense.

231
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,619
LAURA: Okay, "tower." It is "tower."

232
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,460
TRAVIS: "The magician sought justice in the tower"--

233
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,979
[crosstalk]

234
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:06,759
MATT: The cards should go in the slots 
based on the order they are.

235
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,541
TRAVIS: "But," "but"-- yeah, "The magician 
sought justice in the tower but"--

236
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,616
He's trying to figure out the "but"s 
and the "the"s in between,

237
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:18,675
and I don't care about any of that. 
I just want the last tarot card.

238
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,910
LAURA: What's the last word? 
What's the last word?

239
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,650
TRAVIS: We got two more words.

240
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,068
No, no, no! Skip to the last word 'cause 
that's probably what the last tarot card is!

241
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,421
MATT: So "D"--

242
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,319
TRAVIS: Is this one right here?

243
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,051
MATT: Yeah.

244
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:32,053
TRAVIS: "D," okay. And the "H" one is an “E”.

245
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,688
MATT: Correct.

246
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,234
TRAVIS: And then-- it's like a pi symbol.

247
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:38,150
MATT: I've drawn these. That is a "A."

248
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,193
TRAVIS: "A."

249
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:41,080
LAURA: What's the last word?

250
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,460
CHRIS: What is that less than symbol?

251
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,461
TRAVIS: That's a "T." It's "death" I think.

252
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:48,940
"The magician sought justice 
in the tower but found only death."

253
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,610
Death. Death.

254
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,290
I have no idea what that means.

255
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,751
MARISHA: The-- there's another deck, 
there's another deck. Hang on.

256
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,180
I don't know why there's two decks.

257
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,561
MATT: I'll take half of it, here. 
Death, got it.

258
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:02,782
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go.

259
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,180
LAURA: Okay. Oh, what do I see 
in this amazing crystal ball?

260
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,650
CHRIS: It just looks like a piece of glass to me.

261
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,491
Whoa, it's turning blue!

262
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:11,561
LAURA: Oh, it's doing something.

263
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,736
The crystal ball lights up, 
Matt starts reading it.

264
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,352
MATT: Oh, right here. It says--

265
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,582
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

266
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:21,431
I start trying to push his head out of the way 
so I can see the words. 'Cause apparently I do that.

267
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:25,682
MATT: "Eth topnoi fo sncseipua." Awesome.

268
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,683
CHRIS: Oh, that makes lots of sense.

269
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:31,503
It's a cool message and it reads like latin, 
but within a brief second I realize

270
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,904
that it's an anagram and we need to try 
and figure out what these letters make up.

271
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,284
LAURA: Is it backwards?

272
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,414
MARISHA: Read it backwards.

273
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:40,365
CHRIS: "The potion of..." Uh--

274
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,806
TRAVIS: You suck!

275
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:47,097
MATT: A-U-P-I-E-S-C-N-S. Makes a lot of sense.

276
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:48,936
MARISHA: A-U-P--

277
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,757
MATT: A-U-P-I-E-S-C-N-S.

278
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:55,225
We immediately had to just shout out the letters 
and try and figure out

279
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,505
what the actual phrasing was. Hopefully.

280
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,096
CHRIS: A-U-P-I?

281
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:00,506
MARISHA: Are you sure, you guys?

282
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,004
MATT: Those are the letters that are there.

283
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,906
LAURA: Yeah, it's an anagram.

284
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,006
These letters make a spell.

285
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:10,225
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. 
Is it this? Purification?

286
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:12,946
LAURA: But purification isn't-- 
there's no "F" in this.

287
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:18,165
CHRIS: "The"-- okay, T-H-E-- let's 
just rearrange the words. It's E-T-H so it's THE--

288
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,007
LAURA: That's it, the Potion of Puissance.

289
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,516
MATT: "Gain might to wrench from stone--"

290
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,785
We find this list of ingredients to make a potion.

291
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,836
MATT: "--by mixing dust of funny bone."

292
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:31,846
It's supposed to make us strong so 
we can pull the sword out from the stone.

293
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,015
LAURA: Dust of Funny Bone.

294
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,028
CHRIS: What else do we need?

295
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:38,227
MATT: How about this? "The sorrow 
of a fiery beast and essence of a spider's feast."

296
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,706
MARISHA: Okay, here's Dragon's Breath.

297
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,466
CHRIS: Drops of water--

298
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:44,636
TRAVIS: Sorrow of what?

299
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:48,657
MATT: Let's see. "Drops of water: undead's bane,"
so holy water.

300
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:53,990
I'm glad that Matt is here because 
he's really good at interpreting

301
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,517
what a lot of these sentences even mean.

302
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,646
MATT: Flies is what it would be.

303
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:59,106
LAURA: Snake fangs.

304
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,416
MATT: See if you can find holy water.

305
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,928
TRAVIS: There's water.

306
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,201
LAURA: There's water?

307
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,181
TRAVIS: Yeah, can we like, bless it?

308
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,382
MATT: "Deep blackened sea night's stain."

309
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,594
CHRIS: Octopus ink.

310
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:09,550
MATT: There we go.

311
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,293
"Mind of beast lacking haste"?

312
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:15,123
TRAVIS: We're just trying to make sense 
of what goes where and in what order, and it's chaos.

313
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,102
TRAVIS: Like a sloth?

314
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:17,362
MATT: A slow creature.

315
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,611
LAURA: Or a slug?

316
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:21,432
Starting to figure out that 
this potion is gonna be a huge pain in my ass.

317
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,882
LAURA: Sloth brain.

318
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:26,358
MATT: Sloth brain, perfect. 
"And a touch of something sweet for taste."

319
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:27,348
LAURA: Peppermint?

320
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,996
MATT: Sugar? That should work, yeah.

321
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:31,979
"Acridness to curl the tongue"--

322
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,008
LAURA: Acid?

323
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:34,336
TRAVIS: Leech juice?

324
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:35,508
MARISHA: What does that mean?

325
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,648
TRAVIS: Acrid what?

326
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:40,478
Acrid. What the-- what does "acrid" mean?

327
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:41,957
MATT: "Acridness to curl the tongue."

328
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:43,988
TRAVIS: Acrid means, um--

329
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:45,078
LAURA: Sour?

330
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:46,577
CHRIS: Castor oil, maybe?

331
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:47,759
LAURA: Sardines?

332
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,927
MATT: Castor oil could work, actually.

333
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,698
"The finishing touch must be sung."

334
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,028
Where's the funny bone dust?

335
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,217
CHRIS: Bat wing powder?

336
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:54,458
MARISHA: Oh, ground humerus.

337
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,078
CHRIS: Want to start mixing 'em up?

338
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,638
MATT: Yeah, mix a little bit in each one.

339
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,917
CHRIS: Okay, tell me what.

340
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,794
MARISHA: Wait, wait. 
Did we also get the spider's feast?

341
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,498
MATT: Funny bone, that one there.

342
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:06,897
CHRIS: What's next?

343
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,817
MATT: We have the funny bone, 
the dragon's breath just went in,

344
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,847
we have the spider's feast now, 
which would be the--

345
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,102
LAURA: Spiders eat flies.

346
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:14,627
MARISHA: Or bugs. Yeah, it's 
gotta be something buggy.

347
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,427
LAURA: Oh, what about this? 
Coagulated blood of flies?

348
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:17,908
ALL: Yeah, yeah.

349
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,817
CHRIS: Coagulated blood of flies, 
putting it in there.

350
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:21,539
Ingredients, pretty nasty.

351
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,888
I hope we don't have to drink this.

352
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,376
CHRIS: Looks pretty tasty, actually.

353
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,855
LAURA: Drops of water. Now water.

354
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:29,188
MATT: Uh, ink is next. 
The deep blackened sea night's stain.

355
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:30,203
So, put the ink in.

356
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,507
LAURA: Octopus's ink.

357
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,148
MATT: "Mind of beast lacking haste," the sloth brain.

358
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,316
MARISHA: This is so foul looking.

359
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,278
CHRIS: Ugh, god. I feel like 
Tom Cruise in Cocktail.

360
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,627
LAURA: You're gonna eat this, Chris.

361
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,489
MATT: "Touch of something sweet for taste."

362
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,639
CHRIS: Touch of something sweet?

363
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,629
LAURA: I'm putting in the peppermint.

364
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,189
MATT: I don't see anything else that looks sweet.

365
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,366
MARISHA: I'm nervous about the dragon's breath.

366
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:52,408
A lot of the ingredients in these potions 
can be easily switched out for other ingredients

367
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:58,029
and that's making me really nervous. 
I don't want to make this potion 80 times,

368
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:58,968
I really don't.

369
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,979
MATT: It's "the sorrow of a fiery beast," 
you don't see like dragon's tears or anything.

370
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,488
TRAVIS: Dragon's tears is over there.

371
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,119
LAURA: Oh, dragon's tears?!

372
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,729
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we need.

373
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,279
LAURA: We're putting in dragon's tears.

374
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,268
MARISHA: Dragon's tears, not dragon's breath.

375
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:14,738
CHRIS: There's pond slime, is that acridness?

376
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,318
MATT: "Acridness to curl the tongue."

377
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:17,748
LAURA: What is "acridness"?

378
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,259
None of us have any idea what "acrid" means.

379
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,030
LAURA: What is "acrid," is it acid-y?

380
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,684
MATT: Acid-y, bitter, awful to the taste.

381
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:27,240
Apparently, it means "acidic." Hey. Brilliant.

382
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,126
TRAVIS: Siri, what's "acridness" mean?!

383
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,399
CHRIS: Where are we? Uh--

384
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,099
MARISHA: I don't know what else it would be.

385
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:36,530
LAURA: Acromantula? Or sardines, or cod liver oil.

386
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,557
CHRIS: Oh, I don't know. Uh--

387
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,907
MATT: Hornclump juice and pus. Yeah.

388
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:44,530
CHRIS: I don't know. Guys.

389
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,795
MATT: Y'know what? Let's go ahead and 
add the acromantula whatever it is to there,

390
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:48,799
just fuck it.

391
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,499
TRAVIS: Roll the dice! Buy the ticket, 
take the ride!

392
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:53,530
CHRIS: Okay, adding acromancer's venom.

393
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,279
LAURA: And then we sing--

394
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,659
TRAVIS: Which one?

395
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,878
MATT: It's supposed to give us strength.

396
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,320
LAURA: Is there one in there that 
says something about strength?

397
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,481
MATT: "The finishing touch must be sung"?

398
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,509
LAURA: "Grandma's Sweat [inaudible]"? 
I know what that's from.

399
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,392
MARISHA: Does it have a--? 
The finishing touch must be sung.

400
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:16,392
We cannot get too literal but also 
we want to make sure we're literal enough

401
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:18,982
to where we're not missing clues.

402
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:21,942
MARISHA: Maybe it's not literal. Hang on.

403
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:25,495
That made me nervous. That makes me really nervous.

404
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,541
MARISHA: Maybe it's another ingredient.

405
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,752
MATT: Oh, sung! We have vocal cords-- 
I saw something here that was--

406
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,643
MARISHA: Something-- oh, ground vocal cords!

407
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,322
LAURA: That's it, that's it!

408
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:34,732
MATT: Thank you.

409
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,573
LAURA: It's going in, ground vocal cords.

410
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,523
MARISHA: It's in, it's in! Now what?

411
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:39,852
CHRIS: Should be working now.

412
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:40,585
LAURA: Who's gonna drink it?

413
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:41,632
CHRIS: [revolted noise]

414
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:42,697
TRAVIS: Are we drinking it?!

415
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:45,383
I wasn't 100 percent sure that 
someone was supposed to drink it.

416
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,632
MARISHA: Do we have to drink it?

417
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,883
MATT: For someone to get the might. 
If no one's gonna do it, I'm gonna fucking do it.

418
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:52,674
I'm watching Matt drink this and 
I'm like, "I don't know if you're supposed to drink this."

419
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:53,970
LAURA: Gross!

420
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,172
Ha ha, he had to drink that.

421
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,953
Wasn't me!

422
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,304
MATT: All right.

423
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,534
CHRIS: Okay. You just drank that 
for no reason, didn't you?

424
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,754
MATT: Probably. Well, we'll see if it works or not.

425
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:05,724
LAURA: Pull out the sword from the stone!

426
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,282
MATT: See if it'll allow it. No!

427
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:12,545
I think the thing that went wrong 
with this potion is, um-- I have no idea.

428
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,924
MARISHA: Which one-- what are we missing--

429
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:16,623
MATT: It might be the acridness.

430
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:19,885
I think we used maybe the wrong ingredient, 
one of the wrong ingredients.

431
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:20,987
Maybe it was that acrid thing.

432
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:24,623
MARISHA: Our public school educations 
are failing us!

433
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,274
CHRIS: Actors are supposed to be 
smarter than this!

434
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,364
MARISHA: Do vinegar.

435
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:29,805
MATT: Adding vinegar to it.

436
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,081
LAURA: Adding vinegar to the potion. 
We added vinegar.

437
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:35,274
Matt, and everybody that's been 
working on the potion, solve it.

438
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:36,564
CHRIS: He's gonna drink it again!

439
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:38,039
He just drank it twice.

440
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,634
MATT: Oh, that's terrifying.

441
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,205
LAURA: Try it, Matt.

442
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,281
He drinks it--

443
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,094
[TRAVIS, offscreen]: --nothing happens.

444
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,645
[sounds of frustration]

445
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,144
CHRIS: Oh my gosh.

446
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,504
LAURA: Is it because we added things 
to it that shouldn't be in there?

447
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:54,003
I haven't really been helping much at this point 
so I start looking around the room

448
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:57,725
for secret doors and things that I can pull. 
The candlesticks, by the way--

449
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,396
don't move. But I tried all of them.

450
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:02,765
LAURA: Oh, this smells so bad now.

451
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,344
It was not-- not good.

452
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,123
CHRIS: Can we find an hourglass something?

453
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,465
MARISHA: That's what I'm looking for.

454
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,805
[MATT, offscreen]: We're pretty sure we have 
all the right ingredients and we put them together

455
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,745
and we're trying this out, 
but it's still not working.

456
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:17,884
We're really frustrated. So we began 
to have to look at it even closer

457
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:21,214
and try and see if there's something 
we're missing in this specific dialogue.

458
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,545
LAURA: "Gain might--"

459
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:24,515
MATT: "--by mixing dust of funny bone, 
the sorrow of a fiery beast,

460
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,312
the essence of a spider's feast, 
drops of water (undead's bane),

461
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,492
deep black and sea night's stain."

462
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:31,924
MARISHA: "Drops of water, undead's bane." 
There's two separate things.

463
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:35,012
CHRIS: What's "undead's bane"?

464
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:36,699
TRAVIS: Holy water, right?

465
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,112
MATT: Holy water.

466
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:42,522
LAURA: "The finishing touch must be sung." 
Maybe we just have to sing it.

467
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:45,661
♪ I'm drinking this potion down! ♪

468
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,667
MARISHA: ♪ She's drinking a potion! ♪

469
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,391
LAURA: ♪ Oh yeah, and it's disgusting! ♪

470
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:54,662
This potion is foul. I'm pretty sure 
we put some wrong ingredients in there

471
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,831
because it made me want to puke, 
just a little bit.

472
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:02,403
CHRIS: Uh, "Gain might to wrench from stone 
by mixing dust of funny bone,

473
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:05,511
the sorrow of a fiery beast--"

474
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:08,282
LAURA: The sorrow is dragon's tears.

475
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:13,513
As we're pouring through these various potion elements 
I immediately remember that one of the spells

476
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:16,941
we have on the table immediately relates 
to making something holy or blessed.

477
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:19,473
MATT: Oh here we go, I got it, I got it! 
For the holy water. Sorry.

478
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:22,988
It's part of the spells for it, that's-- 
I'm so dumb for not seeing that.

479
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,512
"To change water into something blessed 
is a simple task. Do not feel pressed.

480
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:28,866
Simply raise the bottle to a light and chant--" 
Where do we have light?

481
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:29,882
Oh, there!

482
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:33,212
Of course it's Matt who figures out 
that you have to bless the holy water.

483
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:35,840
LAURA: Right there! Right-- no, here!

484
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,617
MATT: "Benedictus aquaticus."

485
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,200
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself, brother.

486
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,651
I love how exasperated he was in blessing it. 
He's like, "Ugh. I bless this holy water

487
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,680
and it's now holy. All right. 
Can we move this along?"

488
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,450
MATT: We shall see!

489
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,681
I want Matt to be my priest all the time.

490
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,889
LAURA: Okay, wait. Now what's next?

491
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,100
CHRIS: "Essence of a spider's feast."

492
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,451
LAURA: That was the coagulated blood.

493
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:00,421
MATT: There you go.

494
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,231
Going to add a little bit of the ink here as well.

495
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:03,492
MARISHA: Go, go, go!

496
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,892
MATT: Sloth brains.

497
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:06,400
CHRIS: "Touch of something sweet for taste."

498
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,062
MATT: That's going to be the peppermint.

499
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,202
Vinegar.

500
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,642
LAURA: Now, sing it and drink it, Matt!

501
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:13,921
MATT: No, we have to put the 
ground vocal cords in there.

502
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:17,981
CHRIS: Doesn't say anything about drinking it, 
I just want to say that, just out loud.

503
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,062
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he likes it. 
It's his thing.

504
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:22,281
MATT: All right, mix that up.

505
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,771
Oh, that is disgusting!

506
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:28,179
We're pretty sure we put all the pieces together 
for this potion.

507
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,179
We've got the holy water functional for us.

508
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,077
[MATT, offscreen]: But something isn't working, still.

509
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:37,538
No matter how hard we try. And redo it. 
It's not working.

510
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:40,479
Thankfully, Marisha finds a note.

511
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:47,648
LAURA: "In magic, it's not the song that matters, 
but the purity of the singing."

512
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,488
MARISHA: All right, well jeez. We're fucked.

513
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,999
MATT: ♪ I take responsibility for this failure ♪

514
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:59,530
I will say that for all the dread 
and disappointment I was feeling in myself

515
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,541
through all that puzzle--

516
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:03,772
MATT: Oh, thank you! For the love of god.

517
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,847
--being able to finally finish that potion, 
reach over and pull that sword

518
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,192
from the stone was a moment of vindication.

519
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:11,790
He's so strong, that Matthew Mercer.

520
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,211
MARISHA: What does it say?

521
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:15,820
MATT: It has-- uh, the sword doesn't say anything.

522
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,819
I had to start wandering around the room 
searching little things that

523
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,010
maybe haven't been discovered yet.

524
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,061
MATT: It has two notches on it--

525
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:22,629
[sounds of excitement]

526
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,870
And I found a little scroll that 
was hidden up on one of the shelves.

527
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,531
'Cause he's tall and he can do that.

528
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,132
At least I can contribute that way.

529
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:30,380
TRAVIS: Travis is tall.

530
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,111
LAURA: Travis is tall, Travis is tall!

531
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:39,341
CHRIS: Well this doesn't make any sense. 
Yep, I think it's an order. It's coffee.

532
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:43,272
So I realized there's probably more spell things 
like that on the other bookshelf,

533
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:47,596
so I start climbing on the furniture 
to try to find it. That's okay, right?

534
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:51,741
I remember in my tinkering 
and searching the walls with my fingertips--

535
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:55,349
TRAVIS: Hey, you know, there's 
a little slit in that gold dragon's mouth.

536
00:22:55,349 --> 00:23:00,309
A perfect sword-sized slot! 
And so I said, "Put the sword in the mouth!"

537
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,310
MATT: Ah-ha.

538
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,389
LAURA: ♪ I'm so short! ♪

539
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:03,829
Which he did!

540
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,171
And nothing happened.

541
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:08,024
TRAVIS: Can you turn it? 
Can you turn the sword?

542
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:12,048
And then he turned it.

543
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,048
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what's up!

544
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:15,888
MATT: We got a wand and a scroll. 
Okay, okay.

545
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,427
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

546
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:20,389
CHRIS: And I've got these words. 
Okay, maybe these are all parts of a--

547
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:21,888
LAURA: A spell.

548
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:24,689
CHRIS: All right, we've got these 
two fantastic words here.

549
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,217
MARISHA: Is this the hourglass?

550
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,889
CHRIS: This one came up from the top of the shelf.

551
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,199
LAURA: What is this?

552
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,732
And lo and behold--

553
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:32,658
TRAVIS: Yep, scroll!

554
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:33,982
--I find the magical hourglass.

555
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:34,690
LAURA: I found it!

556
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,197
[reading scroll]

557
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,427
MARISHA: There it is.

558
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:40,937
LAURA: Wait, decode it!

559
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,651
MATT: It looks like it's upside down.

560
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,962
I know we're in trouble. 
We don't have a lot of time.

561
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:46,726
TRAVIS: I haven't seen these 
symbols before, though.

562
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:52,491
When the hourglass puzzle finally came about, 
I knew this was a challenge that I had to seek out.

563
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,356
CHRIS: All right, let's work on the bonus puzzle, Travis.

564
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,754
I start looking in the nooks and crannies, 
and in one of the baseboards I find a note--

565
00:23:56,754 --> 00:23:58,017
MATT: There's another scroll here.

566
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,064
--that tells us that we have to 
cast a spell with the wand that we found.

567
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,320
Good times.

568
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,709
MATT: [reading scroll]

569
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,652
Looking around, I see that we have the wand, 
the spellbook, we don't have the amulet

570
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:10,601
and I'm trying to think 
where that could possibly be.

571
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:13,200
MATT: Looking for a magical amulet.

572
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,823
MARISHA: Look for a magic amulet?

573
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:16,232
MATT: Yes, a magic amulet.

574
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,350
[CHRIS, offscreen]: Bonus puzzle 
is just these scrambled-up words,

575
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,015
and then there are all these 
little glyphs that you had to interpret.

576
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:24,242
MARISHA: What has my life become?

577
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:25,441
LAURA: Where's the necklace?!

578
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,131
[MATT, offscreen]: I glance over 
and start looking through some of the

579
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,661
potion materials on the shelf, 
and I can see this nice little square

580
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,307
sticking out of the top of one of 
the large vase-type structures.

581
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,563
MATT: Oh, is this the amulet?!

582
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:37,007
Yes, the amulet! We got it!

583
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:40,175
LAURA: Okay. The book of spells. 
Okay, now what?

584
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:44,235
So once we have everything finally put together for this, 
I put it all on, have my big Harry Potter moment.

585
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,698
MATT: "Invertum illuminates!"

586
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,305
For each moment of this, there's that little pause 
and hoping that something happens.

587
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:50,825
And more often than not, it doesn't, 
and you get kind of sad.

588
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,434
MATT: I don't know what that did!

589
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:54,394
And there was that awkward pause--

590
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,279
[excited cheering]

591
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,849
--and the moment that the blacklight hits, 
and all the lines of arcane energy hit the wall--

592
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:01,889
TRAVIS: Look over here!

593
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:05,540
--that is probably one of the coolest moments 
that we've got to experience.

594
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,760
TRAVIS: Look, there's runes over here.

595
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,774
Lit lines appear on the back wall and 
they're connected to runes on one side and

596
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:15,854
they're connected to a shelf with 
all of these different items on the right side.

597
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:21,886
And luckily as soon as that one lit up, 
we all kind of knew what was going on with that one.

598
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:25,079
MATT: Okay, so each of these corresponds to one of these runes.

599
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,369
I turn around and there's, like, 
disco lights on the wall and so much has happened.

600
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,439
Matt's wearing an amulet and I don't 
even have a clue of what's happened

601
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,170
in the last five minutes.

602
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,884
MARISHA: I'll follow this line. 
Just need to follow the lines.

603
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:39,320
TRAVIS: I'll take the second one.

604
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,538
LAURA: I got this one.

605
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,762
So we start trying to find 
which line connects to which item.

606
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:48,511
Travis takes one of the lines and Marisha 
takes one of the lines so I take one of the lines,

607
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:50,887
and we're all tracing and following each other around.

608
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:54,600
While not colliding with each other. 
It's very strange.

609
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,280
MARISHA: Number one is the feather.

610
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,741
TRAVIS: Okay, hold on, I'm gonna 
get this sheet and write on it.

611
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:00,072
CHRIS: Matt, yours is going to 
this right here, this bell.

612
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:01,258
LAURA: The third one down is this cat.

613
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,860
We rocked that one pretty hardcore. 
Fuck the potion puzzle.

614
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,021
I gotta say everyone fell into place 
very quickly on that. I was very excited.

615
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:09,369
Fuck the potion puzzle.

616
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:12,793
Blacklight puzzle though, yeah. 
Yeah. All about that.

617
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:14,140
TRAVIS: So you're the first--

618
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,010
MARISHA: Yeah.

619
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,230
LAURA: I'm the third.

620
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,040
TRAVIS: One, two, three.

621
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,201
LAURA: Maybe we should write the symbols?

622
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:23,371
CHRIS: Hey guys, I've almost got this.

623
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:24,589
LAURA: Okay, what is it?

624
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:29,600
CHRIS: "Time--" What's this one? 
Time something, something focus balance--

625
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,351
what are these?

626
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:35,140
MARISHA: It's like a diamond with legs.

627
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,361
CHRIS: "Arcana."

628
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,290
LAURA: "Arcana," okay. That's an "R" then. 
R, R-- "Order."

629
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,511
TRAVIS: And the block is what?

630
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,222
LAURA: Okay, "time," "arcana," "order," 
"focus," "balance"--

631
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:48,721
CHRIS: Philosophy. And then there's this.

632
00:26:51,191 --> 00:26:53,205
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six.

633
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:58,143
As I'm starting to figure out that 
each of these items have an individual number--

634
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,653
MATT: So what do those correspond to?

635
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,312
MARISHA: Right here, look look look.

636
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:06,462
--I'm realizing the table across 
the way from it also had all these correlating numbers.

637
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:08,274
MARISHA: Here they are, put them in order.

638
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:09,723
MATT: What order should they be in?

639
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,732
LAURA: Oh, the cat is number three!

640
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:15,824
At first I thought they might be related 
to the tarot cards. Glad I didn't go that far.

641
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:19,522
CHRIS: "Y... S--"

642
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:20,529
LAURA: This is two?

643
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:21,704
MARISHA: Yeah.

644
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:25,315
At this point we're not sure quite how far along we are 
and if this actual story's going to come to fruition.

645
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,803
LAURA: Four. Four is the rock.

646
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:29,613
MATT: The compass and the "W" with the line. 
So it's five.

647
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:32,244
[MATT, offscreen]: We get all these pieces and 
we put them on the table in the proper sections

648
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:34,495
where the roman numerals on the wall 
said that they were supposed to be placed--

649
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:36,595
LAURA: Number one is the feather, 
number two is the matches,

650
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:40,655
number three is the cat, four is rock, 
five is chalice, six is the last thing.

651
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:41,541
MATT: The bell.

652
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:45,725
Once again that awkward, tense moment hits, 
and I hear that "click."

653
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:47,286
MATT: Did you hear that click?

654
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:48,355
[cheering]

655
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:51,644
Inside there's a little scroll. 
Laura, of course, being the scroll hoarder,

656
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:52,515
yanks it out.

657
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,614
I'm a greedy code, clue finder.

658
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:57,616
[TRAVIS, offscreen]: And I had a habit of grabbing the little 
golden blankets they were all placed on

659
00:27:57,616 --> 00:28:01,384
and shaking it out, 'cause you never know. 
These rooms are tricky. Bastard sorcerer.

660
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,073
MARISHA: Guys, we can do this!

661
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:10,084
LAURA: "To banish evil, conjoined be, 
arranged in banded geometry.

662
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:14,324
Once per soul, chant the spell 
until the evil sounds its death knell."

663
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:18,273
This was probably the final spell 
to finally banish this dark sorcerer

664
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:21,035
and complete this puzzle. I hope.

665
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,594
MATT: Once per soul, chant the spell 
until the evil sounds its death knell."

666
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:25,423
Do we have a banishing spell in here?

667
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:28,394
CHRIS: Okay, I've got the spell!

668
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:31,533
Solved the puzzle. Of course. 
I mean, I knew I would.

669
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,805
CHRIS: "Chronus additio!"

670
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,577
Boom, we've got five more minutes.

671
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:37,115
MATT: Fuck yeah, Chris!

672
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,286
I mean, I think I pretty much saved the game.

673
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:42,769
Hats off to him, man. He has proven himself 
to be a very important member of this team,

674
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,315
in spite of his own thoughts.

675
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,984
LAURA: "Conjoined be." Oh, good, 
then you can see which one is the top and the bottom!

676
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:48,059
MATT: Read them all together.

677
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,672
LAURA: Wait, what's the top one?

678
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:50,884
MATT: It's this one here.

679
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:57,135
LAURA: "Dimisisti inimicum. Meum in tenebras."

680
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,216
We have this spell that we've arranged 
geometrically, banded together.

681
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,615
LAURA: "Exteriores!"

682
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,996
And nothing happens. The dread sinks deeper.

683
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:12,061
MATT: Okay, "To banish evil, conjoined be, 
arranged in banded geometry." Once per soul,

684
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:15,060
chant the spell-- we all have to do it in order! 
So you did it now, Marisha, go!

685
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,939
And we all start saying the spell.

686
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,431
MARISHA: "Dimisisti inimicum!"

687
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,069
We even have our wand out, 
we don't care if it works.

688
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:22,480
TRAVIS: "Meum in tenebras!"

689
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,610
We say the lines--

690
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,720
CHRIS: "Exteriores!"

691
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,150
MATT: "Dimisisti inimicum, 
meum in tenebras, exteriores!"

692
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,932
And...?

693
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:36,690
Nothing.

694
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,211
CHRIS: Oh, we've got some flickering lights.

695
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,481
TRAVIS: Shit. Do we?

696
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,921
I know we have the spell and 
all the right pieces for it.

697
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:44,490
I just don't think we're doing it right.

698
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,501
I'm completely confused, 'cause I've spent 
so much time trying to solve the additional puzzle.

699
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:53,692
LAURA: Were we supposed to be in banded geometry? 
What does that mean, "in geometry"?

700
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:58,591
I don't honestly know what's happening right now. 
Like, it is completely confusing to me.

701
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:02,982
MATT: Okay, "banded geometry" I would 
imagine be putting them together, but--

702
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:06,222
"Conjoined be, arranged in banded geometry."

703
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,831
Oh, do we need to repair this?

704
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:13,770
MARISHA: Oh, there's a restoration-- 
oh, right, right, right! Where is it?

705
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,482
So we're at this final moment, 
we have everything assembled--

706
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,303
LAURA: Oh, that's a-- for the wand though, isn't it?

707
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:21,551
We know we're on the cusp of finally winning this, 
and we hear this creak behind us,

708
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,831
and we're like, "Did we do it?!"

709
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,858
CHRIS: Hey, how's it goin'?

710
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,082
[buzzer sounds]

711
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:32,082
And it's Janet, with an expression that can only say, 
"Your puppy died." Or, "You lost the room."

712
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,350
JANET: Does this expression say, "You did it"?

713
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,702
She kind of faked us out. I was like, 
"We did it! Maybe she was the evil sorcerer the whole time!"

714
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:43,641
[disappointed groans]

715
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,920
MARISHA: Did we fail?

716
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,821
Janet coming in the room was kind of the same feeling 
I have when Janet comes into the room usually,

717
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:50,291
which is kind of depressing.

718
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,340
JANET: Time's out.

719
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,440
MARISHA: Nooo!

720
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,731
If it was an option to kick her out of the room, 
I might have.

721
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:57,062
And maybe held the door closed, 
hoping for some more time.

722
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,101
But apparently that's not a thing.

723
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,558
JANET: The evil sorcerer still reigns!

724
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,106
CHRIS: That's cool!

725
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,296
MATT: Evil's not that bad.

726
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,147
CHRIS: Magic exists.

727
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:05,277
MATT: Yeah!

728
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:07,137
LAURA: No, but seriously, 
I kind of want to live here.

729
00:31:07,137 --> 00:31:08,466
MARISHA: Yeah, what are they doing with this set?

730
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,097
MATT: [laughs]

731
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:12,417
TRAVIS: Nope, still nothing.

732
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:16,297
We failed.

733
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,883
JANET: Guys, come back in here. 
'Cause you did such a great job.

734
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:23,643
True magical, beautiful work.

735
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:26,843
You had so many great moments of success, 
I know you were so close.

736
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,552
I think there were a couple of things that 
just tied you up a little bit longer

737
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:33,253
than maybe you wanted them to.

738
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:36,962
Aside from all that, it was really really cool 
getting to work with everybody as a team,

739
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:38,422
and I had a great time.

740
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:42,183
It was so much fun. This was crazy, it was so much fun. 
I kind of want to just take

741
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:45,363
the entire room home with me. 
You think they'd mind if some of those

742
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:47,152
potion bottles went missing?

743
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:50,585
LAURA: And Matt had to drink a disgusting mixture... 
three times?

744
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:51,663
MATT: Worth it.

745
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:54,352
JANET: I know, you became the taste tester. 
Especially with all the things that weren't

746
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:58,749
supposed to be in there. So we were like, 
"Oh, no, don't put the vocal cords in there.

747
00:31:58,749 --> 00:31:59,838
No, no, no."

748
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,113
So far he still has a pulse.

749
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:03,654
LAURA: The vocal cords weren't supposed 
to go in there?! We were just supposed to sing it?

750
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,031
JANET: That's absolutely right.

751
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,242
LAURA: But there's vocal cords!

752
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,383
MARISHA: There were vocal cords-- 
oh, we were just supposed to sing it?

753
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,393
You're going to have food poisoning here tomorrow!

754
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:11,334
MATT: Yeah!

755
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:15,143
I was, you know, I'm happy we got as far as we did.

756
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,969
JANET: Realizing the blessing 
the holy water was a very key moment.

757
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,555
MATT: [nerdy voice] To be fair, Dungeons and Dragons rules, 
even just moving water can be dangerous

758
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:24,190
to certain undead, so, um, 
just putting that out there.

759
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,235
TRAVIS: Wow. Wow.

760
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,633
JANET: Ha, do you want to comment on this?

761
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:30,684
CHRIS: Oh yeah, sure. 
I 100% support everything he just made up there.

762
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:36,778
Such a bittersweet thing, 'cause we were so close. 
But damn, that room was cool.

763
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:39,463
JANET: It was a really, really hard room. 
You guys did a great job.

764
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:42,613
You did a great job of watching. 
I know that you were cheering them on at home.

765
00:32:42,613 --> 00:32:44,664
So thanks for watching, and we'll 
see you next time on "Escape!"

766
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:46,162
Scared myself.

767
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,434
MATT: You gotta be careful there.

768
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:51,870
All right, well I hope you enjoyed watching 
our brilliant guests conquer--or, at least harness--

769
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,513
the powers of evil. Join us next week 
for another amazing episode where

770
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:58,993
we take a fresh batch of the celebrities you love 
and find out if they have what it takes

771
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:01,152
to "Escape!" our clutches.

772
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:05,919
And many, many thanks again to Marisha Ray, 
Laura Bailey, Matt Mercer, Travis Willingham,

773
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,086
and Christopher Sabat for today's show. 
And thank you for joining us.

774
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,582
I'm Janet Varney and I'll see you next time 
on "Escape!" Because unlike you,

775
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:16,415
I'm not going anywhere.

776
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:19,554
It's the twist at the end of the show.

777
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,524
See? Still here.
