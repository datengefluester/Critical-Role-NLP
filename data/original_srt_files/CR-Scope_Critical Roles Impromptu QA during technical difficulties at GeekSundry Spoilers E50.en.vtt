NOTE Paragraph

00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:06.221
LIAM: Let me see. I'm going to keep it aiming
around. You're on now.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.689
MARISHA: Hi guys!

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:14.510
LIAM: I lost Laura, you got Marisha. Throw
questions at her, and I'll ask them to her. Keep

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.640
waving. Yay. Hi cast. Okay, good, good. Woo, woo.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.639
LAURA: Marisha.

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:25.599
LIAM: Kirsten says "Marisha, this is cray cray." Oh
jeez I backed into--

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:28.500
SAM: Okay first question.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.070
LIAM: How are you Marisha?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.182
MARISHA: Oh I am fantastic, thank you so much for
actually asking a question.

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:35.999
LAURA: A good question. Super good question guys.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.130
MARISHA: It looks like they're having a video
capture card issue, so we're doing this so you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.619
guys don't watch the whole show in fullscreen.
Because we're sure you'd be very upset about that.

00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:49.775
LIAM: Favorite beast form. What's your favorite
beast form?

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:55.779
MARISHA: Oh, Minxie. All day, every day. But
Minxie has personal value and attachment. And

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:57.731
Travis named her.

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.688
LIAM: Right. Sentimental value.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:00:59.341
MARISHA: Sentimental value.

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:00.161
LIAM: Yeah yeah.

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:00.911
MARISHA: Yeah. 100%.

00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.121
LIAM: How are you doing?

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:07.269
MARISHA: Once again, I'm phenomenal. I'm so
thrilled that you care enough to ask me twice,

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:11.740
chat. Thank you. Good. My dad is in town.
This is my dad everybody.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.450
LIAM: You want him on camera? There he goes!
Whoa!

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:20.170
MARISHA: He just flew in from Kentucky two hours ago.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.051
LIAM: They look just like each other!

00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.400
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs)

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.710
LIAM: How does that happen?!

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.470
MARISHA: It's like there's science behind it.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.759
LIAM: What's your favorite spell?

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:37.130
MARISHA: What's my favorite spell? I mean, Call
Lightning has special love as well because it's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.880
Call Lighting.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.649
LIAM: I'm getting a "Woo-hoo Kentucky."

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.070
MARISHA and MARISHA'S DAD: Woo Kentucky! Woo!
Kentucky!

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.940
LIAM: All right. Minxie, thank you. I'm going to
find another cast member and bother them.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.860
MARISHA: Yeah. Do that.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.750
LIAM: All right we'll go back to Laura.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.780
LAURA: Do you have questions for me now?

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.590
LIAM: Yeah. "Liam, can't see the face camera is
pointed down?" I don't think so, I see Laura's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.412
face on it.

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:57.539
LAURA: Stop it! I just want to look at what's
happening!

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.160
LIAM: Well if you come around you're going to
see-- See?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.529
LAURA: Hello Laura. Can you see me? Can you see
me?

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.799
LIAM: Someone say "I see Laura" if you see Laura.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.829
LAURA: Or is just like from here on down?

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.731
LIAM: Hello from Alaska. Hi Laura. They see you.
How does it feel making 50 episodes, Laura?

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.330
LAURA: Feels pretty good.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.039
LIAM: Yeah?

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.618
LAURA: Feels kind of-- it feels kind of traumatic
actually. Just a little bit of pressure.

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:20.658
LIAM: Elaborate on that.

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:25.068
LAURA: Well I was just worried that when we got to
the 50th episode we were all going to die, or,

00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:30.601
even if one of us dies, like now I feel like we've
been together so long, and with you guys for so

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:36.638
long, that if one us dies or if all of us die
(pause) I don't know, man. It's scary.

00:02:36.638 --> 00:02:39.838
LIAM: What's your-- I'm going to cheer you up.
What's your favorite Trinket moment?

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:46.651
LAURA: Okay. My favorite Trinket moment ever?

00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.042
LIAM: Yes. Ever.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:53.518
LAURA: Favorite Trinket moment! Okay, I really
like when you guys tied a bunch of bows on him.

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:54.676
That was really cute.

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:55.417
LIAM: You're welcome.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:57.059
LAURA: But I wasn't actually there for most of
it.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.465
LIAM: You come back at the end!

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:01.379
LAURA: I really liked when he ripped a vampire's
head off.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.087
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:04.846
LAURA: Come on. That's a pretty major kill for a
bear.

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:09.218
LIAM: What are your feelings on Grog's recent
death?

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:18.209
LAURA: What a freaking surprise! We drove home
from that session and it was like, Travis couldn't

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.707
even talk. Both of us were like, "Holy moly! What
a freaking night!" Like if he'd have died? What?

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:27.978
And none of us even knew? I guess he did die.

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:33.039
LIAM: (humming) Nope, not going to ask that one.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.816
LAURA: What is it?

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:37.296
LIAM: Nope. All right, I'm going to find another
person.

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:38.568
LAURA: Aww, come on back.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.158
LIAM: They're busy.

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:42.098
ASHLEY: Busy doing stuff.

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:43.748
LIAM: Right, stuff. We can't talk about that.

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:44.936
LIAM: Taliesin.

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:45.639
TALIESIN: Hi.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.808
MARISHA: Such a big giant--

00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:50.377
TALIESIN: I can't say what I'm working on, can I?
I'm doing things. I'm working super secret

00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:51.708
projects I can't talk about.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:52.939
LIAM: You can answer questions right?

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:53.890
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.278
LIAM: Okay. Can you break your NDA and tell us
what you're working on?

00:03:59.278 --> 00:03:59.829
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.049
LIAM: No, they didn't ask that.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.389
TALIESIN: I can. Will I? No. But yeah.

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.711
LIAM: What's your favorite book, Taliesin?

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:12.029
TALIESIN: If I'm just for fun? Actually just
because I was a nerd, this kind of nerd as a kid--

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:13.065
LIAM: Surely not, no.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.709
TALIESIN: The Illuminatus Trilogy was a lot of fun
when I was a teenager. By Robert Anton Wilson.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.132
LIAM: Question from me: What's your favorite comic
book?

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:22.267
TALIESIN: (raspberry)

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:24.528
LIAM: What are three of your favorite comic
books?

00:04:24.528 --> 00:04:31.367
TALIESIN: Right now, stuff I'm really enjoying
is-- The Wicked and Divine is fucking amazing.

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:38.356
What else was I reading today? Miss Marvel is a
lot of fun if you're into the Marvel stuff. For a

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:46.158
DC book I'm really enjoying American Alien,
Superman and American Alien.

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.411
MARISHA: Is this one written by Max?

00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:54.788
TALIESIN: Yes. Max Landis's weirdly good take on
Superman. It makes you like Superman.

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:57.148
LIAM: Mmm. Another question from me.

00:04:57.148 --> 00:04:57.698
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:01.042
LIAM: How does it feel to find out I have more
natural 20 rolls than you?

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.267
MARISHA: That you have more what?

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:04.278
LIAM: Natural 20s.

00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:04.968
MARISHA: Oh.

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:08.736
TALIESIN: You're a liar. You're a dirty liar!

00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:09.900
LIAM: (laughing)

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.348
MARISHA: Can we talk about this for a second
though?

00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:11.868
TALIESIN: No.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:13.265
MARISHA: Because once again-- Okay, hang on.

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:15.718
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No, no no no no.

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:17.038
MARISHA: I'm going to find out about this.

00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:17.685
TALIESIN: Oh god.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:22.652
MARISHA: Crit Role Stats put up a chart ranking
our nat 20s and our nat fails.

00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:25.919
TALIESIN: They're biased. (laughs) I'm trying.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.828
LIAM: I think you have more combat 20s.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:31.207
TALIESIN: Well you do roll a lot of natural 20s
also when things are going--

00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:32.586
MARISHA: You do roll a lot of natural 20s.

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:35.017
LIAM: I also lie constantly. Just like
constantly.

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.108
MARISHA: You are a fucking liar.

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:36.538
LIAM: Yes.

00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:38.652
TALIESIN: I was amazed to find that your real name
wasn't Liam.

00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:39.728
LIAM: (humming)

00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:41.205
MARISHA: It's true. Just like you live in
Hollywood.

00:05:41.205 --> 00:05:42.886
LIAM: (humming)

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:44.746
LIAM: Yeah, well Adolf is really hard to sell.

00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:46.208
MARISHA: (laughing)

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:48.628
LIAM: In the entertainment industry? Probably in
all industries.

00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:52.438
TALIESIN: That got dark! (laugh) Little--

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.847
MARISHA: That's true, a lot of the producers are--
You know what?

00:05:55.847 --> 00:05:56.469
TALIESIN: Never mind.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.867
MARISHA: I'm going to move on.

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.209
TALIESIN: Walking on, walking on.

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.625
MARISHA: So.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:03.447
TALIESIN: Yeah no. I'm actually very excited that
I'm-- I feel better about it.

00:06:03.447 --> 00:06:04.167
MARISHA: Well hang on--

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:05.137
TALIESIN: I felt weird about it.

00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:08.978
MARISHA: Because me and Taliesin and-- but Ashley
doesn't really count, because she's kind of an

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:10.848
anomaly. She's been out--

00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:12.437
LIAM: She said you don't count. She said--

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:13.701
ASHLEY: I'm an anomaly?

00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.758
MARISHA: --the math.

00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:17.669
TALEISIN: Yeah. The grouping is too small. The
sample is too small.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.718
MARISHA: The sample is too small. Sam and I were
tied on natural 20s and only two away from natural

00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:29.357
ones, which makes me think it's not-- We just-- 
how we roll

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:34.745
TALIESIN: You do roll-- well it's the battle
rolls, because like-- I roll a twenty three times

00:06:34.745 --> 00:06:35.229
an attack.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:36.446
MARISHA: Right.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:37.393
TALIESIN: So it--

00:06:37.393 --> 00:06:41.957
MARISHA: Most of the time we don't even roll to
attack. Matt is rolling against us.

00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:43.349
TALIESIN: Against your magic.

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:43.849
MARISHA: Right.

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.129
LAURA: And me and Liam roll stealth checks all the
time.

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.639
TALIESIN: And that's where your numbers come from.
Yeah. That's where your numbers come from. You get

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.557
all the passive rolls.

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:54.898
MARISHA: I mean. There's all the skill checks but
like you were saying, roll three, and you do too

00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:57.488
LIAM: You also-- when you roll 20s, you really
celebrate.

00:06:57.488 --> 00:06:58.949
TALIESIN: I do. It feels good.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:06:59.879
LIAM: Noticeable.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.448
TALIESIN: I need the dopamine, man.

00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:04.078
LIAM: (laughing)

00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:07.758
TALIESIN: The reason I have the Super Mario coin
as my text message is because every time I get a

00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:10.178
text message it's like, Ah! It can't be that bad.

00:07:10.178 --> 00:07:15.818
MARISHA: Wondering how much percentage I am I
wonder how much more less we roll than you

00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:20.119
TALIESIN: You know what? We don't' have to figure
that out, because CritRoleStats will do that for us.

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:24.031
MARISHA: CritRoleStats will murder us if we ask
them to count many times we roll.

00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:24.631
TALIESIN: I know.

00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:26.400
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Don't do that.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.250
TALIESIN: Really don't do that.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.610
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to turn the camera
around

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.927
LAURA: No no no-- I'm scared to give it over--

00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:33.990
LIAM: --camera. Oh look we're still there!

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.593
LAURA: I was going to hold it for you.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:48.175
LIAM: So that's all right. I'll answer two
questions. The right ones. Okay. (humming)

00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:56.254
The podcast will happen sometime in late 2022 
after civilization has fallen. We will be using

00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:57.174
tin cans and a string.

00:07:57.174 --> 00:07:58.334
LAURA: How are those wounds?

00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:05.403
LIAM: Oh man. I'm going to pull my pants down but right in
there? It is the nastiest; it is dark brown.

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:06.702
LAURA: I'm still sore!

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.081
LIAM: Terrible.

00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:09.391
LAURA: We did this last week, you guys.

00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:18.059
LIAM: Hmm. (noise) The game with my daughter has
not happened yet, that's on Sunday. Where are

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:24.861
Travis and Sam? They're making out in the men's
room. Laura, if Trinket was a person, what would

00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:26.390
his race and class be?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.099
LAURA: Isn't there a bear person class?

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:30.150
LIAM: Were-bear?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.970
LAURA: He's a were-bear.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.920
LIAM: He's a Care Bear.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:39.870
LAURA: He's a were-bear and he is... I think he'd
just be a fighter, a barbarian.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.610
LIAM: Somebody asked who is the best archer.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.099
LAURA: Who's the best archer? Ashley.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:45.698
LIAM: No, between you and me.

00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:46.280
LAURA: Me.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.990
LIAM: They didn't ask about Ashley, they asked
about you and me.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.960
LAURA: I was not as good.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.669
LIAM: You sure? That's not what I remember.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:59.220
LAURA: That's only because I started out not
great, the one that had the thing for the arrow slot--

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.999
LIAM: Pride talking.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:04.483
LAURA: So I was on one of these ones that didn't
have a thing to say arrow and Liam won.

00:09:04.483 --> 00:09:07.459
LIAM: I shot all the bows and hit the target all
the time.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:08.295
LAURA: No you didn't.

00:09:08.295 --> 00:09:08.841
LIAM: All the time.

00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:09.702
LAURA: No you didn't!

00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:11.461
LIAM: I hit the target all the time!

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:12.390
LAURA: You lie!

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:18.982
LIAM: I told you I was a liar. Let me see, one
more-- give me a twin question. One twin question.

00:09:18.982 --> 00:09:22.390
I'm sure Travis watched the NFL draft.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:27.850
LAURA: Good luck on your interview! Oh! You got
it?! I remember that from Twitter!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:35.321
LIAM: Oh cool. (gibberish) Always, that's the
answer, everybody. My middle name is--

00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:37.282
LAURA: Like in real life?

00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:39.521
LIAM: My middle name is Christopher.

00:09:39.521 --> 00:09:41.691
LAURA: My middle name is Dawn.

00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:44.421
LIAM: Dawn? Dong?

00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:46.221
LAURA: Dawn. D-A-W-N.

00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.390
LIAM: Laura Dong Bailey.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:54.251
LAURA: Yes I have one AC shirt you made me, thank
you very much.

00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:56.331
LIAM: How do you guys play twins so well?

00:09:56.331 --> 00:10:00.320
LAURA: It's in the laundry right now, actually. We
actually are twins.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.669
LIAM: We actually crawled inside the womb of a
large animal for a day just to experience that together.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:07.812
LAURA: It was uncomfortable.

00:10:07.812 --> 00:10:09.919
LIAM: It was. I was glad to get back out.

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.601
LAURA: It was a very large creature.

00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:22.100
LIAM: It was a whale. (mumbling) Uh, seriously
twins in real life? Yes, Liam, will you be on Tabletop?

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.140
LAURA: Will you be on Tabletop?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.245
LIAM: (I don't know noise)

00:10:24.245 --> 00:10:26.602
LAURA: Seriously? You need to be on Tabletop.

00:10:26.602 --> 00:10:32.420
LIAM: Talk to Wheaton. (humming)

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.580
LAURA: Maybe if you were as cool as your sister
you'd be on Tabletop.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:41.371
LIAM: That's not possible. "Do you ball like
Jordan?" Hell yeah, I ball like Jordan. I'm terrible

00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.170
at sports. All right, I'm going to find somebody
else.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.110
LIAM: What are you guys doing?

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:51.174
ASHLEY: Still going over things. It's important
stuff. I've returned and I haven't updated my

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:53.364
character sheet in a very long time.

00:10:53.364 --> 00:10:55.163
MATT: She actually did. It wasn't that bad.

00:10:55.163 --> 00:10:56.083
LIAM: Scandalous.

00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:57.953
ASHLEY: I was just nervous that maybe I did
it wrong.

00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.634
MATT: She did everything right. She was worried
for no reason.

00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:08.493
LIAM: Okay. Remember to Turn Undead. All right.
Here is-- oh look they're over here!

00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:10.027
LAURA: You're on--

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:17.057
SAM: And then I told the stewardess, "No. My nuts
are already in the-- Oh hi!"

00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:18.288
TRAVIS: Hey!

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:22.797
LIAM: Quick! Ask these a-holes a question then
we'll go back and get on the video.

00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:23.685
SAM: Oh is it ready?

00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:30.687
LIAM: Yes. Ask them questions. Manly questions.
Tell Travis "Go Cowboys."

00:11:30.687 --> 00:11:34.377
TRAVIS: Go Cowboys. Ezekiel Elliott running back,
Ohio State.

00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:36.466
LIAM: "Are you excited about Zeke?" Somebody just
asked.

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:40.736
TRAVIS: Ezekiel Elliott let's go. Number 14, let's
go! Time to go to work!

00:11:40.736 --> 00:11:44.242
LIAM: Favorite flannel? Oh no, somebody just said
that was their favorite flannel. Sam, how are you

00:11:44.562 --> 00:11:45.258
so manly?

00:11:45.258 --> 00:11:51.603
SAM: Because I stand next to Travis and his musk
wears off on me sometimes. I sort of catch it in

00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:52.221
the air.

00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:55.292
TRAVIS: There's stone giant strength and then
there's Willingblam musk.

00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:57.701
SAM: (laugh) Willingblam musk.

00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:58.851
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) I'm going to bottle it.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.211
SAM: A scent. For him.

00:12:00.211 --> 00:12:01.581
TRAVIS: Yes! (laugh)

00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:05.991
LIAM: All right guys, I think we're going to go
get-- oh fuck a duck. We're going to find our way

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:08.771
back to set so I'm going to end the Periscope.
Thanks for your patience.

00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:10.081
SAM: Good luck, technical stuff!

00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:12.208
LIAM: Yep. Go Kevdak. What did I say?

00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:12.821
SAM: What?

00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:16.032
TALIESIN: [inaudible]

00:12:16.032 --> 00:12:17.270
SAM: Wait, are we supposed to go back?
