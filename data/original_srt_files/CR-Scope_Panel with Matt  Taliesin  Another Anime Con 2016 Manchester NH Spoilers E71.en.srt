[dramatic music]

2
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:17,441
(applause)

3
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:26,189
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ready for dice violence!

4
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,975
MATT: It's too early for dice violence.

5
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:31,817
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

6
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:38,008
MATT: Tap, tap, tap. Can you hear me through the
mic? That's the perfect time for the cricket sounds to

7
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,427
go off.

8
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:44,376
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep making noise.

9
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,998
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We can hear you.

10
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,646
MATT: You got this.

11
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,497
TALIESIN: Wait!

12
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:53,945
MATT: This is not your fault.

13
00:00:53,945 --> 00:01:03,072
TALIESIN: We got one up. Second one is possibly
going to be up.

14
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:06,761
MATT: At worst we'll just have to share a mic.

15
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:08,241
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

16
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:19,887
MATT: No. Thank you for your patience. We'll be
with you in just a second.

17
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,917
TALIESIN: You start talking and I'll sit over
here.

18
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,474
MATT: Okay.

19
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:24,795
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Loot Crate!

20
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:27,025
(laughter)

21
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:31,318
MATT: Sam's not here, it's not the same. That poor
man didn't realize what he was doing when he did

22
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,505
his first real Loot Crate pitch, like, well, this is
your job from now on.

23
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:40,144
TALIESIN: I'm horrified. I was originally like,
I'm excited, I'll eventually get to do one. I

24
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:41,667
don't want to do one any more.

25
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,197
MATT: Yeah! There's too much to live up to now.

26
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:49,787
TALIESIN: I'm still [inaudible]-- okay, fine.

27
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:53,677
MATT: So, good morning, everybody! How you doing?

28
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:58,188
(cheering and applause)

29
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:06,189
MATT: Welcome to our hopefully well-rested Sunday at
noon Critical Role panel. Who had a good night

30
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,237
last night?

31
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,847
(cheering)

32
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:11,568
MATT: Who's suffering today because of it?

33
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,238
(cheering)

34
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:14,654
MATT: You are the true champions.

35
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:15,987
TALIESIN: Hey! Found your badge! Yay.

36
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,138
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I got a new one.

37
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,468
TALIESIN: Even better.

38
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,386
MATT: Is that Allura over there?

39
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,378
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah.

40
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:22,796
MATT: That is amazing!

41
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:24,597
TALIESIN: So much cosplay.

42
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:25,818
MATT: I love it!

43
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,499
TALIESIN: I don't know what happened.

44
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:30,086
MATT: #CriticalCostumes for our Halloween
contest.

45
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:33,023
TALIESIN: Critical Costumes with an 's'? Critical
Costumes?

46
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,579
MATT: One of the two.

47
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,653
TALIESIN: Yes.

48
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:43,928
MATT: We'll just check them all. I don't remember.
I'm still groggy. So who are you?

49
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:51,973
TALIESIN: Hi, my name is Taliesin Jaffe. I'm a
voice actor and voice director and somehow a

50
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:56,655
Dungeons &amp; Dragons player at this point which has
apparently become a thing I say now in front of

51
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:05,249
crowds of people. It is a unique and exciting
opportunity and makes taking Lyfts and Ubers

52
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:12,597
around the city even more exciting than it used to
be. Really great. It's nice to actually see them

53
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:19,848
get worried. "You do what? No." Yeah. "I don't
know what that is! Ah!"

54
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:25,057
MATT: Well, sometimes it helps end the
conversation you don't need in the back of the Uber.

55
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:31,847
TALIESIN: Another test. Carry on! Keep talking!

56
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:39,277
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm a voice actor
from Los Angeles. We got it?

57
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,800
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're good. Carry on.

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:52,029
MATT: I've been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons most of
my young adult and adult life and I'm damn proud

59
00:03:52,029 --> 00:04:05,598
of it. There's other RPGs but D&amp;D is kind of my
mainstay, and somehow this happened. We all know

60
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,308
what this means. We don't know how this happened.

61
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:11,923
TALIESIN: Is there anybody here who got dragged
here and has no idea why they're in this room?

62
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:15,398
(laughter)

63
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:20,478
MATT: All righty! So to give you a little heads up
on that, Critical Role is a Twitch stream that we

64
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,187
do pretty much every Thursday night where me,
Taliesin, and a bunch of other nerdy-ass voice

65
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:34,008
actors play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It began as a
private game we played for two years in

66
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:39,276
Pathfinder, and then Geek &amp; Sundry approached us
because somehow word got around the industry that

67
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:44,630
there was this voice actor D&amp;D game, and like,
"You should do it on camera." We were like eh.

68
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,430
TALIESIN: Look at that. Yeah.

69
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,968
MATT: Yay!

70
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:59,135
TALIESIN: It's like a Brookstone puzzle of wires
down here. It was so impressive. It was red to

71
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:05,008
green. It was like a Mansions of Madness
mini-puzzle down here. That's evil. Thanks, man!

72
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:06,326
MATT: Success.

73
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,416
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, tech!

74
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,887
(applause)

75
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:12,916
AUDIENCE MEMBERS (chanting): Tech crew! Tech crew!
Tech crew!

76
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,900
TALIESIN: That should happen at every panel.

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,407
MATT: There isn't enough appreciation for the tech
crew. We were iffy on doing our game on-camera

78
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,780
because it was something that was personal to us
and whenever you put anything on the internet,

79
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,047
you're ready for the internet to tear it into 14
pieces, light it on fire, and laugh at you in your

80
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:38,561
pile of tears. When they told us they were doing a
Twitch channel and it allowed us to play unedited

81
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:46,869
for all the rough bumps and mishaps that is an
actual D&amp;D game, then at least that allowed us to

82
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:52,326
continue what we were doing, just adding cameras to
the room. I think we were happy to find that it

83
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:56,779
really didn't change the experience too much and
we're still having fun playing D&amp;D once a week in

84
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,139
front of a lot more people.

85
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:08,681
TALIESIN: I was quite pleased that our most-viewed
episode so far has been the one where I'm mostly

86
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:09,730
not in it.

87
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,197
(laughter)

88
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:16,791
TALIESIN: Wow, all they had to do was get rid of
me and suddenly we've got more people watching. We

89
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:21,892
should do that in every episode. That's great. So
sorry.

90
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:28,563
MATT: (angry voice) "We'll give you ten bucks,
here, you can kill Percy every episode."

91
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:33,335
TALIESIN: We're going to make so many likes. All
the internet likes will be ours. We'll be swimming

92
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:34,770
in internet likes.

93
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,153
MATT: "The whole marketing team crunched the
numbers and you get at least a 25% increase in

94
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:44,747
"viewership every time Taliesin is not on screen.
Do it!" God, if that conversation ever happened,

95
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,582
that's when we're gone.

96
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:51,864
TALIESIN: I was about to say, to be fair, who
would we have that conversation with? We are

97
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:56,555
pretty much left to our own devices mostly. It's
nice. They just let us do the show. It's really sweet.

98
00:06:56,555 --> 00:07:00,882
MATT: At the very beginning, they were like, "Hey,
this show's going well. You should do these

99
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:02,093
"things!" We went--

100
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,013
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

101
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:10,470
MATT: They went, "What?" We went, "We'll leave."
They went, "Do your thing." It's been nice to be

102
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,022
able to hold our ground.

103
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:17,497
TALIESIN: I'll say, the tech crew and even the
production crew at this point, we're all on the

104
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:21,516
same ship together at this point, it's nice.

105
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:27,705
MATT: Everyone involved with the show's
production: really cool people and we have a good time.

106
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:36,474
TALIESIN: It was a couple of weeks ago when that
giant tub of Legos came in. I was so excited

107
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:41,492
because I had a guest with me and I wanted to
introduce her to everybody. The show's happening

108
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:46,392
and things are getting ready, but half the tech
crew are just sitting building Legos. They won't

109
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:51,151
even make eye contact, just like slowly-- I'm
like, "Guys, are you--" and just like, "No, this

110
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:59,079
"is what we do now." It's a fun place to work.

111
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:05,072
MATT: So, that's the gist of Critical Role. You
can check it out, it's a bunch of us just

112
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:11,897
improvising, making weird voices, and rolling
dice. But, yes, this is primarily a conversation

113
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:16,987
Q&amp;A about the show and anything surrounding games
that you have. Any burning questions you got in

114
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,426
the back of your skull.

115
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,935
TALIESIN: I wanted to point out, it's your only
5th edition game you've ever run, isn't it?

116
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,401
MATT: It is, actually.

117
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,368
TALIESIN: Before that was Pathfinder, before that
was 4th edition.

118
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,223
MATT: Before that was 3.5 and every edition
previously.

119
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:33,787
TALIESIN: It just suddenly occurred to me, this is
the only experience you've had running 5th

120
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:35,489
edition. That's so crazy.

121
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:41,558
MATT: I only have so much free time. We started
streaming a once a week campaign.

122
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:44,775
TALIESIN: That changed everything, didn't it?

123
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:49,277
MATT: We used to play once every six to eight
weeks, maybe. Mind you, we'd play for a marathon

124
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:54,569
session, it would be a six to nine hour game when
we did play. We'd just block out an entire Saturday.

125
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:59,318
TALIESIN: You want to watch something sad? This is
my favorite thing to do to hurt him. You remember

126
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:00,568
War Machine?

127
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:01,965
MATT: (sadly) Yeah.

128
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,578
TALIESIN: That's a beautiful army you've got. It's
a shame nothing happens with it anymore.

129
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,768
MATT: I know. They have a new edition out, too.

130
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:13,229
TALIESIN: That's what I hear. I haven't finished
painting the minis I got for Christmas last year.

131
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,969
MATT: No, I still have them at my place.

132
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:18,412
(laughter)

133
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:20,618
MATT: MK3 rules look really nice. They made some
good changes.

134
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,508
TALIESIN: I've heard. I haven't had time.

135
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:25,210
MATT: Me neither. That's fine.

136
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,820
TALIESIN: Maybe after we finally open up that new
Mansions of Madness at some point.

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,195
MATT: Me and Marisha did try that. The new
Mansions of Madness edition is really cool.

138
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,933
TALIESIN: Now I'm a little envious, actually.

139
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:42,189
MATT: A fan sent us a copy and pre-painted all the
minis. Which is so awesome! I think I opened it on

140
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:46,312
the last Periscope we did, but it was really cool,
because I've been wanting to have Mansions of

141
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:50,207
Madness with all the minis painted. I got half of
them done with the older edition and just didn't

142
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,326
have time, and so it was really cool that somebody
did that.

143
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:57,127
TALIESIN: Not that I'm jealous. Who did you play
with, was it Key and Brittany?

144
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,999
MATT: No, it was just me and Marisha. You can play
with two people.

145
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:04,935
TALIESIN: Oh, because of the app, okay. We're just
talking about games, I'm so sorry. Okay, so the

146
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,650
app works. That's good. I'm very excited about
that.

147
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,487
MATT: It takes a little bit of a learning curve,
but once you get there it actually runs pretty

148
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:13,948
well. Narratively, actually, it's pretty cool
because-- anyway, hi guys! You're here, too.

149
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:18,388
TALIESIN: We don't get to talk much, so this is
really nice. It's so good not to see you on a weekday.

150
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,686
MATT: I know.

151
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,856
TALIESIN: Should they just raise their hands?

152
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:24,842
MATT: Let's have some questions, how about that?
You pick first.

153
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:27,648
TALIESIN: Let's start on the left in the hoodie.
You, sir.

154
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:32,983
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Taliesin, you're generally very
secretive about what you like to do in the game.

155
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:38,776
Is that a Percy trait or is that a Taliesin trait
of trying to hide it from the audience and hide it

156
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,264
from your fellow cast members?

157
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:46,223
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's probably a me-- God, it's
been so long. I finally got to play a character

158
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:51,797
who wasn't Percy for the first time a few weeks
ago and it was such a surprising breath of fresh

159
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:59,206
air. Not in a bad way, but like, "Oh, that's
right, I can do other things." It's a me trait,

160
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:04,509
but he really probably brings out more of it than
would necessarily be normal because he's not a big

161
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:13,628
talker. I was originally brought into the game to
be a bit of a ringer, just to make sure there was

162
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:18,427
somebody in the room who kind of knew the rules,
kind of knew what was happening, and could shove

163
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:24,506
everybody in the right direction. I got used to
playing that way of like, "I don't want anybody to

164
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:28,675
"see what I'm working on. I'm going to let
everybody else who this is their first D&amp;D game

165
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:32,371
"figure this stuff out and I'm just going to come
in at the end if there's anything to sweep up."

166
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,320
AUDIENCE MEMBER: To follow up, what were the rules
for Percy coming back?

167
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,198
TALIESIN: I won't go too deep into them. I will
say I would have been happy either way. We had a

168
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,324
conversation.

169
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:46,647
MATT: We had discussed your next possible
character.

170
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:54,218
TALIESIN: Sitting over really alcoholic beverages.
Dangerous levels of alcohol at Laura and Travis'

171
00:11:54,218 --> 00:12:00,513
house, and if he ever goes, I have a great
character that I'm really excited for. Like,

172
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:03,595
<i>really</i>. I checked it and it's good.

173
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:06,469
MATT: I already have a way to work it into 
the lore and the current story.

174
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:16,537
TALIESIN: The only big rule was because of his
most recent experiences with the Raven Queen, any

175
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:28,259
attempt to invoke a deity was going to be an
automatic no. Just because he has gone in a weird

176
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:37,302
direction where it's become a-- You can't really
be an atheist in D&amp;D. That just doesn't make any

177
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:43,293
sense, that's just an idiot, because a golden
flaming fist just came down out of the sky and

178
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:46,972
crushed a dragon. You'd be an idiot to be like,
"There's a perfectly reasonable explanation for

179
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:58,049
"that. That's a weather balloon, obviously." He has
decided that he wants nothing to do with any of

180
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:02,608
them. Any attempt to invoke any of that would have
been an automatic no.

181
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,658
MATT: Pike got close.

182
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:09,748
TALIESIN: I was watching, like, "What are you
doing, girl? What are you doing? Oh, okay." She

183
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:14,233
got close to a no. You pick one.

184
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:21,929
MATT: Let's go on the-- I'm biased. Hi, Allura.
Sorry, guys. You come dressed up as an NPC, I'm

185
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,704
going to pick your question first. Just setting
that up for future panels.

186
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:30,189
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I know that DMing is very time
consuming. How many hours of preparation does it

187
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,403
take to prepare for a session?

188
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:37,991
MATT: The question was how many hours does it take
to prep for a session as a DM? It varies depending

189
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:44,398
on what's coming up. If the next episode, the
players are on a very clear track and I know what

190
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:49,305
the next couple of events they're probably going
to encounter might be, then I'd say it takes about

191
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:55,972
an hour of prep per hour of gameplay. So if it's
going to be a three to four hour session, three to

192
00:13:55,972 --> 00:14:04,578
four hours of preparation. As I recently
discovered with the episode where they were

193
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:09,317
bringing you back, I call that a nexus episode,
where there are multiple plot threads out there

194
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,449
and they can go to any of them and they're getting
to a point in the story where they have to make

195
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:18,818
that choice of where to go, then my life becomes
horrible because I have to prepare for many

196
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:26,258
different opportunities here. So that was about a
four-hour episode. I think I prepped about nine

197
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:32,827
hours for that one. That was also because I didn't
know if they were going to go into the Abyss to

198
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:36,988
try and find Yenk the goristro, in which case I
had to prepare a bunch of encounters in the Abyss

199
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:41,404
and made two additional maps for various
Abyss-based encounters. I didn't know if they were

200
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:45,183
going to go for the Dawnmartyr plate, so I had
stuff for the City of Brass prepared including

201
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:49,510
some encounters that would have worked with the
fire plane and the City of Brass. I also had a

202
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,038
couple other NPC encounters. I prepped a lot of
things so that I wouldn't be completely lost if

203
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:58,904
they went off the rails, which they always do
anyway, but you try your best as a DM to prepare.

204
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:03,588
TALIESIN: There was just a giant pile of maps and
you after the game were like, "Welp, didn't need

205
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,169
"any of that, did we?"

206
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:10,549
MATT: I made a whole Whitestone battle map just in
case they decided to say, "Sorry, Raishan," and

207
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:19,065
then attack, which would have gone really poorly
for everybody involved. It can vary depending on

208
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:24,018
what point in the story they are. But on average,
it's about an equal amount of hours per prep to

209
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:28,059
gameplay, usually. Good question. You pick now.

210
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:36,898
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the-- actually, we
may get to everybody eventually, so I'm just going

211
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:40,536
to start pointing randomly. The girl in the red
shirt right back there.

212
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:45,057
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is actually a question for
Matt. I'm going to start DMing my first campaign

213
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:50,995
soon, so I wanted to ask you what is some of the
best advice you wish you knew when you started DMing?

214
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,891
TALIESIN: Run!

215
00:15:52,931 --> 00:16:01,928
MATT: Let's see, trying to make this quick. I
have a bunch of GM Tips videos you can go look up

216
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:06,117
which go into more detailed stuff, and I have more
of those starting soon. We did a whole new run of

217
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:10,844
them that go into more of the nuts and bolts, a
little look under the hood there. Look for those

218
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:17,644
soon. My recommendation is start small. It's very
easy to get lost in like, "Well, I have to create

219
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:25,356
"a world and create all these civilizations and
political struggles and (screaming)." Start in a

220
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:29,743
very small location, a key location, and flesh
that out well so the players can play within that

221
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:33,886
small space and you have a really good idea of
what can be done in that area. Then as they're

222
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:37,375
playing in that space you can then expand a little
and expand a little. So definitely start small and

223
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,991
then grow out. That doesn't work for everybody, of
course. People love the whole world building

224
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:44,638
aspect, and that's totally fine. But for people
that are starting, it can be a little daunting.

225
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:50,447
Other than that, keep in mind some of the best
experiences are when you're trying to facilitate

226
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:57,287
the players to have incredible moments. The very
old school Gygaxian mindset of DM versus players,

227
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:02,436
"I will smash you all and you will have fun," can
work as long as you all agree ahead of time that

228
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:07,617
that's the kind of game you want to play. If you
want to run Tomb of Horrors and your friends are

229
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:10,187
like, "Yeah, let's do Tomb of Horrors," then yeah,
go ahead and do it, that's awesome. Just make sure

230
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,596
that everybody's on the same page on what kind of
game you want to run. That way you don't end up

231
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,804
getting halfway through and someone is like, "Oh,
I thought we were going to do, like, political

232
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,972
"intrigue, I made a character based around that.
Now we're fighting kobolds and I can't do

233
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:23,328
"anything." Then you end up leaving out players. So
have everyone talk beforehand and make sure you're

234
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:28,454
all on the same page with what kind of game you
want to run. I think those are two big steps right there.

235
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,140
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

236
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,160
MATT: No worries!

237
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,003
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a really good one. I picked
one.

238
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,561
MATT: I know. I'm going to go in the way back.
You, sir, with the yellow shirt on the left. Or

239
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:38,857
pink shirt, I can't tell.

240
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,077
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Orange shirt.

241
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:43,381
MATT: Orange shirt. Oh, it's in between. I got to
the bookend colors and eventually came together.

242
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:51,238
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've heard that there's going to
be a sourcebook for the Critical Role setting and

243
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,547
I'm just wondering, is the gunslinger class going
to be a full class or just remain an archetype on

244
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:57,896
the DM's Guild?

245
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:06,920
MATT: In regards to the campaign setting, which
has been an amazing experience of having no free time.

246
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,881
TALIESIN: We miss you, too.

247
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,002
MATT: I'm excited for it. I've never written
something like this before and I hope you guys

248
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:17,882
will like it. First off, I'm trying to see if I
can get permission to put those in the book

249
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:22,351
because one of the interesting elements of putting
things on the DM's Guild is technically in the

250
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,728
rules you're not allowed to then publish them in
other facets. It's one of those "now it's on DM's

251
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:32,198
"Guild, it stays on DM's Guild" circumstance, so I'm
trying to see if I can find a way to put the blood

252
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:38,093
hunter and the gunslinger in there. As far as
turning it into a full class, people can do their

253
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:44,889
own mods; I created it as an archetype because I
didn't feel there was necessarily enough there for

254
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:48,179
the build that I did to make it a full class. I
could if I had time and I wanted to stretch it

255
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,659
out, but it seems to be working fine the way we
have it, so I'm probably not going to change it

256
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:56,071
dramatically from what's been tested and worked in
the campaign. But there are other people out there

257
00:18:56,071 --> 00:19:00,933
that have made their own custom firearm gunslinger
based classes out there that are actually pretty

258
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,879
awesome. I saw a gun mage class that was pretty
cool on the DM's Guild.

259
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:07,542
TALIESIN: Someone sent me a really interesting gun
cleric.

260
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:12,759
MATT: Gun cleric? Heal! Heal! You're basically
Ana.

261
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,554
TALIESIN: It was basically full-on an Overwatch
character.

262
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:20,760
MATT: So we'll see. I don't think it's going to
become a full class more than just an archetype,

263
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,088
just because that's what we have tested primarily
and creating anything new and publishing it

264
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:29,059
without having any real extensive test time sounds
like a really bad idea to me.

265
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:35,681
TALIESIN: This week's cluster of stupid is a good
sign that it's well-balanced. I had a wonderfully

266
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:39,574
pitiful round, which I'm happy about. I'm glad.

267
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:46,178
MATT: It's a powerful class. The grit recycling
works really well for crits and deaths. It seems

268
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:51,038
to balance pretty well from being a little bit
stronger in some cases and then the drawbacks can

269
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:52,790
be pretty nasty at times.

270
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,823
TALIESIN: Two critical fails on the guns is just
sad.

271
00:19:56,823 --> 00:20:00,401
MATT: If you play a gunslinger, pull a Percy and
make sure you have as many John Woo weapons on you

272
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,196
as possible.

273
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:08,255
TALIESIN: Have a close combat object of some kind.
Something. That's the worst.

274
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,030
MATT: Indeed. Good question.

275
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,479
TALIESIN: I'm probably going to try and keep
pulling through. I'm going to keep popping around

276
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:20,843
a bit. You, sir, with the hair. Yeah, you, right
there. Yes, you know who you are, you have the

277
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:27,491
hair. No, no, no, we'll get there.

278
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:33,240
MATT: To be fair, he also has hair, too. We all
have hair.

279
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,239
TALIESIN: I suppose that is hair, sort of.

280
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,869
MATT: We'll do the guy with the hair, and then
we'll do the guy with the hair.

281
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:44,427
AUDIENCE MEMBER: He loves that you noticed his
hair. You have no idea.

282
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,380
TALIESIN: I ruined everything.

283
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,262
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a person in one of my
games who is going to be eventually playing a

284
00:20:53,262 --> 00:21:00,640
gunslinger and he wanted something to be a bit
more support-y. So I was wondering, just to bounce

285
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,779
this off you guys, the idea that, like Ana, tranq
darts, but you fill them with various potions.

286
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:13,009
TALIESIN: I don't know if that's something I would
do in our game just because, although I'm very

287
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:18,992
amused by the notion of a paintball gun, basically
what you're talking about is paintball guns full

288
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:23,185
of Tiger Balm where you're just hitting somebody
with like, what are the odds of that being

289
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:30,490
knockout gas? I love the idea of just like, "Oh,
it itches, what have you done?" I'm amused by the

290
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:38,078
notion of a poison slinger of some kind. Although
it really would be a mess to try and make those

291
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,499
all the time.

292
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:43,911
MATT: Yeah. The cool thing about D&amp;D is you can
try anything. Whatever you think fits your

293
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:50,265
campaign, go for it. A tranq dart aspect with
healing potions could get expensive very quickly.

294
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:57,608
Plus, nothing sucks more than pumping a 150, 200
gold potion into a tranq dart and then missing.

295
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:02,199
Also rolling a critical one and hitting the
creature instead is like, "Whoa!"

296
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:05,919
TALIESIN: What would you think of 1d4 per dart?

297
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,038
MATT: 1d4 healing per dart?

298
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,716
TALIESIN: That would be kind of interesting. Super
low health, that would be kind of amusing that you

299
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:16,393
could actually pump 3d4 into someone but it might
go horribly wrong and you might hit an enemy if

300
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:17,753
you miss.

301
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:22,000
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The main thing he joked about was
a potion of diminution against mounted combatants.

302
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:34,519
TALIESIN: That would be pretty fun. The history
nerd in me is like, that's very German, that's

303
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:42,044
great. Somewhere there's a 16th-century German
military historian going, "Yeah, it is very

304
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,365
"German!" There's one in the crowd somewhere.

305
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,754
MATT: You'd be surprised. It's like a gunslinger
alchemist combo, that would be interesting. Yeah,

306
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:54,444
try it out, why not? No reason not to. That's why
I like D&amp;D, you can just do anything and it'll

307
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:57,544
probably not work but you'll have fun trying.

308
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,535
TALIESIN: Give it a few rounds, you'll figure it
out. It's a cool thought, though. Do you want to

309
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:02,513
pick one?

310
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:04,192
MATT: I feel like we should get the other guy with
the hair.

311
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,831
TALIESIN: Guy with other hair.

312
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:11,980
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I appreciate it. As a theater kid
myself, thank you very much for showing the

313
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,141
respect for the tech because you're right, they
don't get the respect.

314
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,403
TALIESIN: Don't drop the mic, they're expensive!

315
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:20,095
AUDIENCE: If you're a voice actor, you don't touch
the mic.

316
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,648
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

317
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:27,773
AUDIENCE MEMBER: From your experience both as RPG
players, DMs, but also as actors and directors,

318
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,895
have those two worked together in such a way where
you've found experience from one field is

319
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,946
dedicated to another and back and forth between
the two of them?

320
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:42,225
TALIESIN: Yes yes. Very yes. Yes. We should
probably repeat the question. Has working as a

321
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:47,696
voice actor and working as a voice director
influenced our play and has our play influenced

322
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:53,754
our work as voice actors and voice directors? Oh
my God, yes. Not just the game we're in right now.

323
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:59,701
Always. I think it's one of the reasons why so
many of the people we bring on as first-timers who

324
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:12,772
are VO people are really good. Mary Elizabeth is
just delightful to watch, and Will is-- Any time

325
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:15,034
we have VO people on I'm always just so excited.

326
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:18,568
MATT: Because they realize, "Oh, this is kind of
what we do for a living anyway."

327
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:25,594
TALIESIN: There's a lot of the same skill sets. I
love our friends who come on who aren't

328
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:31,401
necessarily big VO people, like I love having
Chris, and I'm not going to call him other Wil,

329
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:38,384
and Felicia. They're fun because they know the
game and they're into it and they're down, but I

330
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:43,884
love watching a new VO actor being like, "I don't
know what I'm doing!"

331
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:49,886
MATT: Then comparably we had Rothfuss, who had
plenty of D&amp;D experience, but even he came on and

332
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:53,614
before we started playing, he was like, "I'm
really intimidated." He was nervous. In the

333
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:57,304
kitchen I'm like, "You wrote The Name of the Wind,
are you serious?"

334
00:24:57,304 --> 00:25:02,132
Once again, once he got comfortable with it,
he made an amazing character that had an amazing

335
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,633
story impact to Keyleth's personality.

336
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:11,625
TALIESIN: Then two months later dropped a bomb on
us. From space! Out of nowhere!

337
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:19,337
MATT: It was so good! On the other end of that, I
will say, part of the reason I even became a voice

338
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:25,061
actor was because of D&amp;D. I played these games
long before I became a professional actor, and as

339
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:30,345
a DM especially, having to create all of these
personalities and inhabit them and find variations

340
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:34,193
to voices to try and mix it up and make the
characters interesting became a toolbox of

341
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:39,774
personalities that I was able to fine-tune and
utilize as a voice actor later in life. I can say

342
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:45,003
with complete honesty, probably a third of the
characters I've ever performed as an actor had

343
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:49,035
some sort of root or base as an NPC in my high
school D&amp;D games.

344
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:56,069
TALIESIN: I can go in on that one, too. That's
very true. I hadn't really thought about that. Any

345
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,850
weird voice I ever do probably started in some
game in high school. That's nuts.

346
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,133
MATT: So yes. Both ways.

347
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:11,884
TALIESIN: I'll throw to the red coat in the front
because I'm highly entertained by your outfit.

348
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:14,768
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good, it's supposed to be Dr.
Ripley.

349
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:20,304
TALIESIN: (gasps) Yes, with the hand! Yes!

350
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:22,233
MATT: That's fantastic.

351
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:26,563
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You guys talk a lot about finding
a game that fits you. How do you gracefully bow

352
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:30,607
out of a game that maybe isn't what you wanted it
to be?

353
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:33,363
TALIESIN: Blow it up, leave nothing!

354
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:36,555
MATT: Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be
sure.

355
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:41,235
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I have a friend who ordered C4
through a Vampire LARP, so, that happened.

356
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:46,985
TALIESIN: I've watched so many of my favorite
vampire LARPs be destroyed by three jerks. All it

357
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:54,610
takes is three jerks to ruin a perfectly
functional vampire city. I hope he's listening. He

358
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,478
knows who he is. I had a good thing going.

359
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:06,670
MATT: There's always the, "Oh, guys, my shift
changed. I can't make the game time, sorry, have

360
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,307
"fun!" You can do the white lie route because then
nobody gets hurt. People come in and out of games

361
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,810
all the time because of work.

362
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,259
TALIESIN: It is a breakup, though. You have to
accept that somebody's feelings are probably going

363
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:23,249
to be a little miffed. Although it's possible if
you're not having fun, they're not having fun with

364
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:27,781
you there, either. So you can always do the
roommate thing of, "I love you as a friend and I

365
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,982
"know if we live together for another month I'm
going to end up hating you, so I'm ending this now

366
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:38,790
"so I can still love seeing you and not want to
throttle you. This is slowly going to poison

367
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,711
"everything I love about you and make me want to
strangle you in your sleep."

368
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:48,339
MATT: If you're not enjoying the game, you can
always talk to the DM beforehand and let them

369
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:53,411
know. In some cases, without communication, they
might not be aware that they're running sessions

370
00:27:53,411 --> 00:28:00,351
that aren't to your liking or tastes. If they're a
good DM, they'll be open to constructive criticism

371
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:05,040
and be like, "Oh, okay, I didn't know that that
was an aspect that you were missing but you

372
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,580
"wanted. I'll see if I can incorporate that more
into the game for you." If they're really

373
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,361
defensive and like, "Well, if you don't like my
game, then step off," then step off! They just

374
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,417
gave you complete permission to cut away free and
dry, like, "All right, see you sucker!"

375
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:23,231
TALIESIN: Not every game is for everybody. I've
definitely been in games where I'm not having a

376
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:28,841
good time and I've been in games where somebody
else is obviously playing a different game and

377
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:35,226
we're like, "Ah, man, I dig the game you're
playing, I hope you find it, or I'll run you

378
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:37,804
"another game." I've done that before, both
directions.

379
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:40,971
MATT: Which is why, once again, communication
before you start playing is so key because that

380
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:44,235
way everyone has an idea of what they're looking
for and if it's the game for them, and the DM

381
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:49,280
knows what kind of players to tailor the story to.
I would recommend first having a conversation and

382
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,569
express that, because there is a possibility that
it could become what you're looking for. I would

383
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:58,072
say give the DM the chance to go ahead and do
that. If they're not willing to, then just

384
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:02,552
respectfully bow out and look for a game that more
suits your interests. Because it is your free time

385
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:05,361
that you're allocating to this. Don't feel like
you should stay out of obligation.

386
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:08,390
TALIESIN: It's supposed to be relaxing and
therapeutic. It's not supposed to be what you're

387
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,471
actually talking about in therapy.

388
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:12,991
MATT: That's a good way of putting it.

389
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:16,303
TALIESIN: Really, it's supposed to be the den of
the therapy, not the problem.

390
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:25,167
MATT: Good luck. I'm going to go ahead and pick
you, sir, over on the far side with the Zelda shirt.

391
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:30,682
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You guys play a lot of general
RPGs. Are there RPGs you prefer playing? You play

392
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:33,364
a lot of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. What would be your
next favorite RPG?

393
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:36,200
TALIESIN: It's legitimately been two years since
I've touched anything else. I'm trying to think.

394
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,991
You go.

395
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:42,360
MATT: I love D&amp;D because it's what I grew up with
and the 5th edition system is really comfortable

396
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,921
to me. It takes a lot of my favorite aspects of
older editions and streamlines them where it

397
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:50,820
allows you to build narrative within the rules a
lot easier, which as a person who loves narrative

398
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,092
more than anything, that to me is a great thing.
But there are other systems that do it really

399
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:59,141
well, too. The Fate system is really fun. I've
played a few games in the Fate system. As far as

400
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:05,770
sci-fi stuff goes, I really enjoy Traveler and
Diaspora. Those are both really good. Traveler is

401
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,519
one of the few RPG systems where you can die in
character creation.

402
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,437
TALIESIN: That and HoL, man.

403
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,571
MATT: That and HoL, definitely.

404
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,931
TALIESIN: Human-occupied landfill.

405
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:24,517
MATT: I love the Deadlands setting, like the weird
west. It's very cool, very strange, and I love

406
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:29,211
good western settings, anyway, so that one's a
great one. The original system, though

407
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:33,008
complicated, I think is the better of the two, but
if you want more of a simple gameplay style, you

408
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:36,698
can go with the newer editions, which is what we
did for our one-shot.

409
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:39,338
TALIESIN: I like Risk.

410
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,987
(laughter)

411
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:49,833
TALIESIN: I like the World of Darkness one,
Vampire: The Masquerade, both tabletop and LARP

412
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:54,706
I'm a big fan of. Also on their end, I liked all
their little addendums. The Mage game is an

413
00:30:54,706 --> 00:31:00,927
enormous amount of fun. Any attempt to play it in
a LARP is always a hilarious failure in the best

414
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:08,605
way. Changeling, Werewolf By Night, the whole run
of them is just a great time. On that other end,

415
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:12,748
there's some old-school stuff. Teenagers from
Outer Space, which is one of the first anime

416
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:16,025
tabletop games, is just dumb. It's great.

417
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:23,408
MATT: If you want the other end of dumb anime
RPGs, you want to go Full Saiyan or Ninja Scroll

418
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:26,007
style insanity, Exalted is always a good time.

419
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:34,152
TALIESIN: Exalted is that end and TFOS is more
like Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha vibe. Like harem anime stupid.

420
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:42,237
MATT: Exalted is more like, "I put all my strength
into one final attack. Destroy everything." It's fun.

421
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:50,208
TALIESIN: Cyberpunk and Cybergen was always a big
one. I remember GURPs being fun, but I think I was

422
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,456
probably wrong.

423
00:31:51,456 --> 00:32:00,907
MATT: GURPs is fun in the same way that paper is
fun. Depending on what you do with paper, it can

424
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:02,808
be a lot of fun or really boring.

425
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:06,266
TALIESIN: It's way too awkward. It's just, "Well,
I'm going to make a robot vampire that has the

426
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,787
"Sword of Omens," and you can kind of do it.

427
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:14,066
MATT: Speaking of which, Rifts also is a
ridiculous experience in the same vein. I'm not

428
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,396
saying it's a good system.

429
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:20,042
TALIESIN: No, but boy, you can do anything.
Champions from back in the day was always fun. I

430
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:24,017
was a Champions player briefly. Are there any good
superhero RPGs?

431
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:28,837
MATT: Actually, the Marvel RPG that came out five
or six years ago was actually pretty decent.

432
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:33,697
Different characters were better at being a solo
fighter versus a group fighter versus a team

433
00:32:33,697 --> 00:32:38,837
fighter and you had different dies depending on
what you were a specialist with. Some characters

434
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:41,758
like Wolverine had better damage rolls if they
were away from a team.

435
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:44,406
TALIESIN: I could go in for something like that.
That would be really cool.

436
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,886
MATT: It was pretty fun.

437
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:49,537
TALIESIN: Vampire kind of fakes that. You could
fake being superheroes in the Vampire world. All

438
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:56,257
right, more hands. I'm going to pick one. Dude in
the glasses right there. I'm just going to keep rolling.

439
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:57,597
MATT: There are a couple dudes--

440
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:01,844
TALIESIN: Yeah, you. No, I'm so sorry. Man, I'm
terrible. I'm awful! Guy in the red shirt.

441
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,828
MATT: Then the other guy with the glasses.

442
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:10,258
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Not counting Critical Role, what
for each of you is your most memorable experience

443
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,127
during a tabletop game?

444
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:16,027
TALIESIN: Whoa. Tabletop or LARP, or just
tabletop?

445
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,277
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tabletop or LARP.

446
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:20,226
TALIESIN: Ooh, okay, I can't talk about that one
because I may actually incorporate that into a

447
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:27,030
game I run later online. I have some really good
ones that I sadly-- There was-- no, I can't talk

448
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:37,253
about that, either. I would incriminate people who
are in this room right now. Oh God, there's so

449
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:44,176
many good ones! Once I had a whole bunch of people
try and turn on me when I was the Prince of Los

450
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:50,795
Angeles in a Vampire game and they tied me up,
threw me in a coffin, wrapped it with TNT, and

451
00:33:50,795 --> 00:34:00,729
tried to blow it up, and didn't think enough to
actually leave the room. I survived perfectly, but

452
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:04,659
the shrapnel damaged everybody in the room and
literally it was just me standing there looking at

453
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:12,617
all of them bleeding going, "You idiots." Just
went down the line and took them all out. It was

454
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,254
amazing. It felt so good.

455
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,349
MATT: That's pretty epic.

456
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:25,032
TALIESIN: Just brush. Wooden shrapnel at vampires.
Oh my God, they were so dumb. Dumbest coup ever.

457
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:28,798
It did not go well for them.

458
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:31,348
MATT: Someone please draw that.

459
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:37,569
TALIESIN: This was at the Mormon Temple, too. This
was the Vampire game that the Mormon Temple was

460
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:44,009
hosting. It was so great. We have the coolest
Mormons in Los Angeles. Best Vampire LARP.

461
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:51,507
MATT: Oh, man, let's see. This is one of the more
ridiculous experiences, talking about Rifts. I

462
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,914
think I mentioned this in a couple panels before.
My friend Todd Huntington in high school was

463
00:34:54,914 --> 00:35:00,259
obsessed with Rifts. It was his favorite system;
he owned every book. Rifts UK! Rifts Asia! Rifts

464
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:05,259
Atlantis! Wormwood! Everything Palladium he had.
His big thing was, because all the books

465
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:10,895
technically were in the same ruleset, any
Palladium book was on the table to be used some

466
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,558
way in the game.

467
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:13,917
TALIESIN: Terrible idea.

468
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:17,720
MATT: We had fun with it, but part of the fun of
Rifts was trying to show him how broken Rifts was.

469
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,289
He was like, "It's the best system ever!" and we
were like, "It's really not, and here's why!" He's

470
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:29,257
like, "No, it's great." As we got into the later
power levels of the game, they also had the

471
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,431
Macross license.

472
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:33,670
TALIESIN: I was about to say, how can you say it's
not broken when the SDF-1 is available?

473
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,819
MATT: Which is what happened.

474
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,065
TALIESIN: Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

475
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:40,289
MATT: In the Macross book, they had the rules for
the SDF-1, which is the giant ship. Now,

476
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:44,840
everything in Rifts has a damage value as a weapon,
even if it's 1d4 times one million megadamage,

477
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,885
which some of the higher-level ship cannons do.
There is a damage value. Except for the SDF-1's

478
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:55,159
main cannon, which takes ten minutes to warm up
before it fires, but we're talking Death Star

479
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:06,048
style cannon. Damage: destroys everything in its
path. Everything. So our team decided, let's go

480
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:11,039
hijack the SDF-1. So we went and wiped out the
entire crew, kept the few that were necessary as

481
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:18,898
slaves to run the actual ship. Then we asked Todd
to hand us one of the other Palladium books, which

482
00:36:18,898 --> 00:36:24,645
was the Pantheon book, which had stats and rules
for all these different pantheons. All the ancient

483
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:28,427
Sumerian gods, like Apsu, Tiamat, Enki, Marduk.

484
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:29,938
TALIESIN: You guys Loboed!

485
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:34,819
MATT: Yeah! They have all the rules for the Norse
pantheon, for the Hindu pantheon, and they all had

486
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:38,918
hundreds of millions of hit points, but that
didn't matter, because our gun destroyed

487
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:52,599
everything in its path. So we went god hunting!
After we took out Thor and Odin with one shot, our

488
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,991
GM, Todd, went, "This is so stupid, I'm done." End
of the game. But we won!

489
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:07,590
TALIESIN: The SDF-1 was like, when that thing came
out I'm like, "Okay, we've got to stop playing

490
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,087
"this game." I remember looking like, "I'm done."
That was the book where I'm like, "I'm done and I

491
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:14,240
"can't pretend that this makes any sense anymore."

492
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,331
MATT: I just envision all the really sweet,
well-dressed Macross crew walking across the board

493
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:24,615
in a very Next Gen feel like, "Captain, we need
to--" All of a sudden this beam in like an Apok

494
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:31,360
from Wormwood and someone in a glitter boy outfit
starts blasting people, laughing the whole time.

495
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,640
TALIESIN: That defense system is all trackball.
It's not that hard to work. It's three guys with a

496
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,895
trackball going, "We got it!" I've watched that
show! That's not like Next Gen where, like, "I

497
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:48,744
"wonder what they're pressing?" That's a trackball.
There's no denying it. Sorry, I'm good.

498
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,618
MATT: Thank you, Taliesin.

499
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:51,909
TALIESIN: I have problems.

500
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,525
MATT: All right, other glasses.

501
00:37:53,525 --> 00:38:02,350
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question's a bit similar. It's
about having experiences with That Guy. The guy

502
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:07,212
who turns into a gibbering mouther in bars or will
pee in the paladin's boots.

503
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:16,043
TALIESIN: There's a good rule nazi and there's a
bad rule nazi. Sean's a good rule nazi. He's the

504
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:20,551
guy who understands how all the math works and is
there to make a shot that shouldn't be possible,

505
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:25,959
but he's read every book and can make terrible
things happen. And he's fun. We have a friend

506
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:31,238
named Sean who we used to play with before he
moved away because he hates us. He hates us so

507
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:37,299
much. Then there's the guys who come in and try
and break the game. I'm never happy with-- why are

508
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:39,294
you trying to break a game? I don't get it.

509
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:43,889
MATT: It's good to work the system in your favor,
but at the same time if it's at the cost of the

510
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:49,292
narrative and everyone else's enjoyment, then
perhaps you need to reassess what kind of game

511
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:55,098
you're playing with. As far as being that guy who
constantly messes with the narrative, some people

512
00:38:55,098 --> 00:39:01,286
you can curb them to make it work. Sam Riegel's a
good example of that. He skirts the line at times,

513
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:06,514
but he never does it to detract from anybody
else's experience, and that's the key. When there

514
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:11,096
is somebody like that, you have to talk to them
about it. After a game, like, "Hey, man, come here

515
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:14,824
"for a second. I just want to let you know, I know
you're having a good time with this, but what

516
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:19,537
"you're doing is kind of ruining the experience for
a few other people. Is there any way you can scale

517
00:39:19,537 --> 00:39:24,777
"it back or just be mindful of everyone else who's
playing as well?" You might be surprised, people

518
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:27,775
might be open to it and be like, "Oh, I'm sorry, I
didn't realize that. Okay, cool, thank you for

519
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:29,469
"telling me, I'll keep that in mind."

520
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:33,143
TALIESIN: A gentle, loving conversation can
sometimes work wonders. I know that sounds weird,

521
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:36,570
but it's true. Genuinely, I understand that that's
weird.

522
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,852
MATT: If they're like, "No, screw you, I'm doing
this anyway, woo, spring break!"

523
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:47,168
TALIESIN: Even that dude, nine times out of ten,
that dude is not ready or prepared for real human

524
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:52,028
interaction, and any actual eye contact in this
conversation about your feelings is just going to

525
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:57,820
turn into a blubbering, apologizing, like, "I'm so
sorry, man." Not all the time, but often.

526
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,480
MATT: Yeah. So try and talk to them. If that
doesn't work out, get with the other players and

527
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,393
find out how you can ambush his character.

528
00:40:07,393 --> 00:40:10,739
TALIESIN: Shh. Shh. Go to sleep. Shh.

529
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:14,550
MATT: Don't do that.

530
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:21,840
TALIESIN: Saving throw! Saving throw! Saving
throw! Problem solved. The dude who tried to blow

531
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,936
me up also had a ship offshore with cruise
missiles. Why do you have ground-to-air missiles

532
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:30,340
in a Vampire: The Masquerade game? You are an
idiot. What game are you playing?

533
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,027
MATT: (laughing) Are you serious?

534
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:42,768
TALIESIN: Like, "No, I have a ship offshore with
ground-to-air." I'm like, "Why? We are 15

535
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:48,818
"people having a conversation in a backyard of a
church. What are you doing?" Of a temple, not

536
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:50,069
even-- ugh.

537
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:55,088
MATT: Talk to them. If that doesn't work, kill
their character.

538
00:40:55,088 --> 00:41:00,035
TALIESIN: I keep taking yours. You pick one.

539
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:08,044
MATT: Let's go in the back. You, sir, in the way
back with the goatee. Or it might've been a

540
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:12,411
shadow. With the glasses. You. It was a shadow.
I'm sorry. But you should grow a goatee, it would

541
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:13,444
look good.

542
00:41:13,444 --> 00:41:19,046
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite morality to play?
Like chaotic neutral...

543
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:28,169
MATT: Everyone's always go-to is chaotic neutral
because you can do anything, and I'm like, "Eh,

544
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,347
"but also--"

545
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:31,709
TALIESIN: That's no fun. Being able to do
anything, that's like chess with no rules. Who

546
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:32,689
cares about that?

547
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:37,470
MATT: Honestly, I enjoy the idea of playing lawful
good to show people that it doesn't have to be

548
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,280
that goody two shoes, stick in the mud, ruin
everyone else's experience alignment.

549
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,849
TALIESIN: You can be Captain America.

550
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:43,937
MATT: Yeah!

551
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:51,359
TALIESIN: Captain America is a great, fun lawful
good character to play. Chaotic good is fun just

552
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,541
because I like having morally ambiguous characters
who are not evil. I'm a big fan of that.

553
00:41:57,541 --> 00:42:03,988
MATT: Comparably, lawful evil can be fun to play
because even though you tend to skew towards a

554
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:08,517
darker morality, you understand the necessity of
structure and order and the necessary

555
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:14,070
circumstances in which you must make alliances you
wouldn't normally have, which is one of the few

556
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:19,425
alignments that can work in a good to neutral
based group with an evil character. One, if they

557
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:22,690
can keep that kind of under wraps or, conversely,
convince the party that it is a

558
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,548
mutually beneficial arrangement. They may not
trust you, but they may still go along with you.

559
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:31,320
That gives you the opportunity to either try and
convert other members of the party or, conversely,

560
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,755
over time, maybe see the light. There's a lot of
different ways you could play that alignment. It's

561
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,991
a difficult one, but it can be a lot of fun.

562
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:44,321
TALIESIN: Chaotic evil doesn't have to be the
giggling worst version of the Joker ever. I had a

563
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:52,434
chaotic evil character in a game for a while who
was great, because he pretended to be lawful good.

564
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:58,191
He was this really nice guy that everybody liked,
and then eventually you'd be in a room with him

565
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:04,914
alone and he would just (twisting noise). I'm
like, "Let me talk to the innkeeper," and kill the

566
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:07,729
innkeeper and stuff him in the closet, and like,
"We've got the run of the place. Everything's

567
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:15,758
"cool." He was slowly undermining everything. If
anybody's watched Hannibal, the television series,

568
00:43:15,758 --> 00:43:19,011
it was just that, "I wonder if I just undermine
everything that everybody I'm working with is

569
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:22,300
"doing right now, what's going to happen. It's a
phone call. We're looking for you. You should

570
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:31,336
"probably run." That's a great way to play chaotic
evil, is to not be chaotic evil when anybody else

571
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:38,269
is around. Just be this avatar of destruction. It
can be a lot of fun.

572
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:43,719
MATT: There's a reason why Taliesin is one of my
favorite players. I've kept him around for a

573
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:44,989
number of reasons.

574
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:52,397
TALIESIN: They're all so innocent. They just don't
know. This is their first game. They don't know

575
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,950
how awful it can be.

576
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,687
MATT: Well, next campaign.

577
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:58,489
TALIESIN: I know, I'm going to ruin them. Oh, you
know that. You know what terrible things we're

578
00:43:58,489 --> 00:43:59,843
going to do to them.

579
00:43:59,843 --> 00:44:00,783
MATT: You pick.

580
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:05,130
TALIESIN: Me pick? Okay. You in the corner right
there, with the hat. Yes, you, with the yellow,

581
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,604
with my Pokemon Team Instinct.

582
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:18,432
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Despite Dungeons &amp; Dragons being
such an improvised-based game, the story you have

583
00:44:18,432 --> 00:44:25,474
in Critical Role is so rich. It's so good. I was
wondering -- you can be included in this if you want.

584
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:26,413
TALIESIN: Oh, no, it's fine.

585
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:31,782
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was wondering, how do you divvy
up the focus amongst each of the characters so

586
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:37,638
that none of the characters are really left out
per se, that everyone has that moment to be the star?

587
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:43,434
MATT: That's the challenge, especially for larger
groups. I would not recommend for anybody a group

588
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:48,483
larger than four or five players. This just
happened to be a large party which I took upon as

589
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,921
a challenge for myself.

590
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,147
AUDIENCE MEMBER: She does ten!

591
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,134
MATT: Ten? Why would you do that? Why? You're so
crazy!

592
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:58,023
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I tried to warn her.

593
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:00,721
MATT: There you go. Well, now you've been
multi-warned.

594
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:03,582
TALIESIN: You can't even make an Avengers movie
work with that number of people. You want to pare

595
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:04,892
it down.

596
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:08,664
MATT: It's a challenge, and you want to be mindful
of that, because you don't want any players to

597
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:14,031
feel left out. What you do is, as you're creating
story-- not necessarily every session can have a

598
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:18,048
golden moment for every character, but you want to
strive for that sort of experience, where you can

599
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:24,711
think of different scenarios where each person has
a chance to shine. That's where players writing

600
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:30,517
backstories come in really handy for you, is you
can find ways to intertwine their history with the

601
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:34,844
current story thread or future story threads where
they not only feel more invested in the current

602
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:39,367
adventure, but you give them an opportunity to
really step up and be involved in the resolution

603
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:44,763
of that storyline. But when you're constructing
encounters and dangers and traps and various

604
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:50,664
challenges, keep in mind what the strengths of
each party member are and what they're good at,

605
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:56,202
and try and tailor experiences where they
themselves naturally feel inclined to step up and

606
00:45:56,202 --> 00:46:00,773
be like, "Hold on, I got this." As opposed to
being like, "There's this thing that you should be

607
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:05,488
"doing, bard." They won't always get it, and that's
fine, they'll stumble, because that's half the fun

608
00:46:05,488 --> 00:46:11,958
of the game is watching your players fall over and
going, "Heh. You poor kids." But it is a

609
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:16,969
challenge. You can only create so much story as a
DM when the other half of it is the players

610
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:21,447
picking it up and running with it. It is that
collaboration that makes it so magical but also is

611
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:29,184
a little daunting and complicated to prepare for.
So be mindful to try and create at least one

612
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:33,914
experience per player per session where they have
the opportunity to rise up and shine a bit.

613
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,049
TALIESIN: Whether they take it or not.

614
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:38,448
MATT: Yeah, whether they take it or not. If they
don't, then someone else will take it up.

615
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:39,852
(phone rings)

616
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:42,164
TALIESIN: I'll get it. I got it. That's nothing.

617
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:46,228
MATT: Just be mindful of that as you prepare.

618
00:46:46,228 --> 00:46:52,153
TALIESIN: And I'll say from the players' side, we
are very, very conscious of not stepping over each

619
00:46:52,153 --> 00:47:01,372
other. We take pains on our end to not get in the
way of other people's moments, of like, "Oh,

620
00:47:01,372 --> 00:47:04,774
"I'll-- oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing that.
Never mind." You'll actually see us occasionally

621
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:10,754
start to do something and reel it back in, and
it's usually the, "Oh, no, I know what's about to

622
00:47:10,754 --> 00:47:15,713
"happen and this has to happen on that side of the
table, and that's great." We're very, very careful

623
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:20,720
about that. Then also the way that we present our
backstories. I have a really good tip for

624
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,520
backstories and for writing character backstories
which is, never give the DM any more information

625
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,571
than your character has. If your character didn't
see it happen, you don't know what happened. If

626
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:37,402
your character doesn't know what somebody's
motivations were or what organization they worked

627
00:47:37,402 --> 00:47:43,505
for or what people they were influenced by, don't
tell the DM. Just tell him what you saw, nothing

628
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:49,135
more. Don't tell him anything other than what you
saw, because he will have so much fun with the

629
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:55,476
rest of it. It's a great way of definitely
creating a situation where you could walk into

630
00:47:55,476 --> 00:48:00,919
what you thought was your origin and just be
turned 180 degrees around, and you get to

631
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:06,052
experience that as a character and that's nuts! If
you've explained everything about how you came

632
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:10,513
about to the DM, that's not going to happen. Even
though you don't know, you're going to just hear

633
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,416
your DM regurgitating what you wrote on a piece of
paper six months ago.

634
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:19,962
MATT: Yeah. It helps you set up your own mystery.
Essentially, you're including the building blocks

635
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:25,656
for a really, really cool series of surprises down
the road for you by writing it that way.

636
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:31,614
TALIESIN: Don't know that you have a daughter.
Don't know why your parents died. Don't know where

637
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:38,698
you came from. Don't know how you ended up where
you are. Just don't know it! It's great. The less

638
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,931
you know, the more fun the DM's going to have.

639
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:43,493
MATT: Mind you, add some structure. Don't hand me
a piece of paper that says, "I don't know."

640
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:52,754
TALIESIN: Other than a list of names and vague
descriptions and basically what amounted to a

641
00:48:52,754 --> 00:48:57,508
week's worth of encounters with those people,
that's all I gave you. There was the Briarwoods,

642
00:48:57,508 --> 00:49:04,035
Father Anders, Doctor Ripley, was literally: list
of names, what happened in those approximately six

643
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:12,305
days I was in their company, and some friends of
ours they vaguely resembled, and basically that

644
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:16,012
was pretty much it. Go nuts.

645
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,687
MATT: The rest of it I went nuts with.

646
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,045
TALIESIN: Yes he did!

647
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:25,722
MATT: All right. Let's see. The glasses and the
green shirt back there.

648
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:33,642
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I really love D&amp;D but I'm also
really paranoid. So whenever my character

649
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:39,599
encounters anything that I personally would find
suspicious or dangerous I internally kind of panic

650
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:46,004
and I almost go into survival mode. If I don't get
a handle on that, it's really hard for me to stay

651
00:49:46,004 --> 00:49:50,643
in character and also not metagame. I never want
to metagame, ever. That's a habit I'm trying to

652
00:49:50,643 --> 00:50:01,573
break. Are there any tips that you can give me on
trying to break this habit of going into survival mode?

653
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,581
TALIESIN: You want to go first?

654
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:08,210
MATT: I'll jump in real fast. One thing:
metagaming isn't a bad word. I want to specify

655
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,479
this. Sometimes people on the internet have
responded to one of our players unintentionally

656
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:17,294
metagaming. They'll be like, "Oh damn it. I hate
when they metagame. It's the worst!" It happens.

657
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:21,593
We're people, and it is a game that we're playing.
While there's an in-character element, there is an

658
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:25,557
aspect of our brain that is trying to put the
pieces together, you know, from a gamer

659
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:30,914
standpoint. So it's going to happen, intentionally
or not. Don't beat yourself up over it by any

660
00:50:30,914 --> 00:50:36,121
means. It's one of those things that comes with
comfort and experience. The more you're with a

661
00:50:36,121 --> 00:50:41,163
character, the easier it is to stay in that
mindset. The newer you are to a campaign, you're

662
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:46,511
still feeling out their skin, you're still getting
what separates you from that character and being

663
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:51,410
able to jump back and forth. What you're
experiencing is not an uncommon thing. Every

664
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:56,151
player goes through that to a certain extent. Us
as performers, our lifestyle is jumping into and

665
00:50:56,151 --> 00:51:02,427
out of characters, and even we still have it
happen every now and then. You can't help it. It's

666
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:08,126
just taking some time to really understand the
mindset of your character, think, as opposed to what

667
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:13,191
makes you similar, what makes them so different
from you and embrace that difference and really

668
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:18,176
adhere to that the best you can. When the survival
instinct kicks in, take a step back, take a

669
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:21,943
breath, and remember what that character's thought
process is, what makes them different from you.

670
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:25,975
Then jump back in and hold onto that difference.
That's what's going to help you kind of stay in

671
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:29,828
character and keep from metagaming in that moment.
It's not perfect. It's hard to be perfect because

672
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:35,370
we're all broken human beings by nature. That's just our
existence. But that does help.

673
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:40,303
TALIESIN: Yeah. As a player, you are the broken
god of a broken player. It's fabulous on that

674
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:44,657
level. You are definitely occasionally feeding
your character information that they don't

675
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:51,127
necessarily have, but because it's in there, it's
just inevitably going to push you in

676
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:56,119
certain directions. That's not a bad thing. I'm
also a big fan of, it takes a little getting used to,

677
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:01,151
but trying to fight the normal natural
risk-aversion of one's day to day life and being

678
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:08,021
okay with abandoning that risk-aversion once you
hit the graph paper. It's tricky, but this is

679
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:11,199
where you can take a risk and the worst thing
that's going to happen is you're going to

680
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:18,028
have to reroll a character. That's great. That's a
great way to get, even in life, more comfortable with

681
00:52:18,028 --> 00:52:27,880
the inevitability of risky decisions. I'm a big
fan of, especially if you're new to the game and

682
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,995
you're having a little bit of panic or fight or
flight when playing, play a character with a

683
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:41,580
little bit of fight or flight. Teenage feral
barbarian is a great way. (yells) Hit it with a stick!

684
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,235
That way you can lean into it if you're feeling
like you want to get comfortable with

685
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:50,799
everything and not feel like you're fighting
yourself. The other thing, and I don't actually do

686
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:55,520
this for Critical Role, but I used to do it for my
games when I was a teenager: I'm a dress-up fan.

687
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:05,091
We used to get, some of us in high school, we used
to get drunk, get stupid, and dress up and play Axis and

688
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:11,460
Allies in stupid costumes while drinking lots of
beer, possibly under the age of appropriateness.

689
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:18,426
Vampire LARPing and all that stuff. For some of my
earlier characters I would have a piece of jewelry,

690
00:53:18,426 --> 00:53:24,158
especially rings or something like, that which was
like, "Okay it's character time." I'm sure you've

691
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:30,428
seen when I play I do a minute of just sitting and
thinking and just going through my Percy Brain. A

692
00:53:30,428 --> 00:53:36,376
ring or a necklace that's something you can play
with at the table and you only wear when you're

693
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:42,920
playing. It's game time. This happens. It's your
uniform. You put it on, and them you have this thing

694
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,389
to constantly remind you where your
head is supposed to be. When it's done, it comes

695
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:48,650
off. I'm a big fan of that.

696
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:56,078
MATT: That's really good. The last thing I'll say
on that topic is it's honestly as fun sometimes to

697
00:53:56,078 --> 00:54:01,393
let yourself fail than it is to succeed in these
RPGs. So when that instinct kicks in, you're like,

698
00:54:01,393 --> 00:54:04,181
"I know that's dangerous, I shouldn't go towards
it, even though my character wouldn't know." Just

699
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:08,842
think, "But, man, my character walking right into
this is going to make such a great surprise moment

700
00:54:08,842 --> 00:54:12,331
"for the rest of the characters and the story, I might
just have to let it happen."

701
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:14,470
TALIESIN: For whoever survives, it's going to be
awesome.

702
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:22,883
MATT: Exactly. Be okay with embracing failure and
bad scenarios even though your brain tells you

703
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,870
otherwise. If the character wouldn't know, let
them walk into that trap!

704
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:32,757
TALIESIN: Failure is so much more glorious than
victory. Oh man. I've had a number of amazing and

705
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:39,639
beautiful shots with those weapons, but taking 25
bullets to the chest and dropping like a fly is

706
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:46,447
going to be the best thing I ever did. That's an
epic failure. That's brilliant.

707
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:50,201
MATT: Yeah. We've got time for a few more.

708
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:52,399
TALIESIN: Green shirt!

709
00:54:52,399 --> 00:54:57,546
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, I've heard this story of
your first character a couple times. The Militant

710
00:54:57,546 --> 00:55:01,007
wizard and how much of a big giant failure that
is.

711
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,060
MATT: Yes, he was.

712
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,130
(laughter)

713
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:07,152
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you had any other characters
where everything just falls apart once it hits the game?

714
00:55:07,152 --> 00:55:16,269
MATT: Oh, yeah. I played a Midlands game where I
made a guy who's like a 75-year-old, crotchety

715
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:24,294
sharpshooter, but I took every single penalty I
possibly could. So he was nearsighted, he was just

716
00:55:24,294 --> 00:55:31,255
an ornery fella. He was just the worst person.
Nobody liked him. Nobody hung around him. He just

717
00:55:31,255 --> 00:55:34,183
got drunk and passed out in every alleyway.
Everyone was like, "Why is he still alive, and why

718
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:39,399
"is he still here?" Nobody liked him. But every now
and then he could pull out his six-shooter and

719
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:40,482
just destroy--

720
00:55:40,482 --> 00:55:42,816
(Taliesin's phone rings)

721
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:47,508
TALIESIN: I literally put it on silent! I just put
it on silent. Keep talking. I'm going to kill

722
00:55:47,508 --> 00:55:49,531
everything that makes noise.

723
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:54,506
MATT: It was a character that completely broke
down when we got to the game, and it was glorious,

724
00:55:54,506 --> 00:56:00,109
because every party member had their strength. He
was a sharpshooter, but he had terrible vision,

725
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:05,319
and he couldn't shoot anything. So he literally
missed every single attack. But man, wasn't he

726
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:11,304
excited to take the credit for every victory they
had. He was useless mechanically, but from a story

727
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:14,310
standpoint, he was an amazing character to have
for the rest of the party, because he annoyed

728
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:18,980
everybody, but everyone found that that ridiculous
confidence and the lack of capability was

729
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,341
endearing in a weird way. So he became this mascot
of the party for a while.

730
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:27,646
TALIESIN: That's a hard walk, man. If you're the
character no one likes, eventually you're just

731
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:31,023
going to be the character that no one likes if
you're not careful. That's a really tough one.

732
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:37,908
MATT: Well, you have to make it in a way where
they're comedic, and how ridiculous and over the

733
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:42,808
top they are in their confidence, and still able
to buy them a round of drinks, because he's the

734
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:45,030
papa bear who helped save them all.

735
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,710
TALIESIN: Yeah, and not ruining everything, which
is a big one.

736
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:53,822
MATT: Good question. Let's see. Hi, Vex.

737
00:56:53,822 --> 00:57:00,309
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. I have a question for Percy.
Did you actually hear what went on when you were

738
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:01,587
getting resurrected?

739
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:02,621
TALIESIN: Maybe.

740
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:04,090
(laughter)

741
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,830
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can I roll a persuasion check?

742
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:11,539
(laughter)

743
00:57:11,568 --> 00:57:15,440
TALIESIN: I'll allow it! Wait, no, up here.

744
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:21,918
(applause)

745
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:25,392
TALIESIN: Just so all of you know, I'm not making
a habit of this, this was just way too amusing of

746
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:27,446
a thing to do, so I'm letting this go once.

747
00:57:27,446 --> 00:57:31,132
MATT: If you wink, you'll probably get advantage.

748
00:57:31,132 --> 00:57:32,810
TALIESIN: Oh--

749
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:37,293
(laughter, applause)

750
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:46,682
AUDIENCE MEMBER: On the table!

751
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:58,131
MATT: It was a natural 20? On the table. So it was
a 14, plus, let's see-- it was a +5 modifier for

752
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:05,760
being proficient in that, so that's 19, plus the
charisma bonus, so that's easily 23.

753
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,390
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm fucked then.

754
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:11,260
MATT: Because she multi-classed into rogue and
took the expertise feat, it's double proficiency

755
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,435
bonus, so--

756
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:14,340
(applause)

757
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:32,706
(cheering)

758
00:58:32,706 --> 00:58:41,601
TALIESIN: That was so worth it on every
conceivable level. That was genius. You with the

759
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:45,918
goggles. Yes. Hi.

760
00:58:45,918 --> 00:58:52,234
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I confess I'm more of a
watcher than a player. Since this has come out on

761
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:57,459
the internet, I've watched Wil Wheaton, I've
watched Critical Role, I've watched Force Grey,

762
00:58:57,459 --> 00:59:01,579
which has ripped my heart out. I think people know
exactly what I'm talking about.

763
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,709
TALIESIN: I haven't seen it yet.

764
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:03,651
MATT: Hey, man.

765
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:10,870
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I will never look at goo the same
way again. But when I was growing up, most of pop

766
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:17,327
culture's idea of Dungeons &amp; Dragons was the angry
fat nerds who would be in the dungeon of their

767
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:26,771
basement arguing about, "But that roll was right,"
or, "That creature's too powerful." Now I'm

768
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:34,052
looking at it and I'm seeing, wow, it's a great
story, and it has people I respect playing it, and

769
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:40,353
there's lots of different people playing it. How
do you feel the internet has helped that image?

770
00:59:40,353 --> 00:59:43,232
Has it helped that image?

771
00:59:43,232 --> 00:59:45,140
TALIESIN: I don't think it's the internet.

772
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:56,570
MATT: To be fair, I was and am that fat guy in the
basement arguing about the rules still. That's

773
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:02,370
always been a part of it, but because when it
first became a cultural phenomenon, whenever

774
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:08,160
anything is misunderstood at large by the public,
people then label it, pigeonhole it, and shove it

775
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,276
aside. It's never really been just that. There's
been a large faction initially of the Gygaxian era

776
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:18,287
of chainmail players, and there was definitely
a--

777
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:23,568
TALIESIN: I was in a few of those games as a
teenager, but I was also in a few games like-- I

778
01:00:23,568 --> 01:00:30,405
was always baffled, because we had a couple of the
basement games. We also had all the goth kids

779
01:00:30,405 --> 01:00:36,452
playing. At one point at our school we just got a
third, a bunch of the cheerleading squad and a

780
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:42,617
couple of the football players playing, because
whatever. People were into it, but who were you telling?

781
01:00:42,617 --> 01:00:45,877
MATT: It's always been more diverse than people
expected it to be. I think what the internet's

782
01:00:45,877 --> 01:00:51,267
helping with, it's giving a platform for everyone
to show how diverse the community has always been,

783
01:00:51,267 --> 01:00:56,150
and is continuing to be. I think what's great
about livestreaming games and a lot of people

784
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:03,240
being able to be more open about this hobby is
it's giving people, one, the confidence to be

785
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,119
like, "Oh, yeah, no, I totally play these games,
and they're a lot of fun, and here's my gaming

786
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:11,270
"group." Conversely, allowing a whole new
generation of people to embrace it because they

787
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,919
thought for a long time it was something that you
don't talk about, and now it can be cool to

788
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:18,991
discuss about it in the older crowd, and a new
generation of people that are being exposed to it

789
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:21,830
for the first time, and being like, "Oh, this is
actually really cool and different than any other

790
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:26,255
"form of entertainment I've done," and starting up
their own gaming groups in school. Then merging.

791
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:29,953
TALIESIN: The other big thing that happened is all
those kids that we were playing with, at least

792
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:34,779
back in Los Angeles, all those kids that we were
playing with in high school now write television

793
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:41,302
shows and direct movies. Like, all of them.
There's a reason something like Stranger Things

794
01:01:41,302 --> 01:01:45,740
exists, and it comes out and you've got Stephen
Colbert just going like, "Oh, yeah, I played D&amp;D

795
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:52,711
"as a kid," and he's just talking, like-- There's
so many people in the business who played D&amp;D as a teenager.

796
01:01:52,711 --> 01:02:00,266
MATT: The fact that the person I've seen geek out
hardest over a natural 20 roll is Vin Diesel

797
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:07,862
should help push the diversity factor of how many
people have been affected by this type of gaming experience.

798
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:12,624
TALIESIN: Does anybody here know T.J. Storm, for
god's sakes? T.J. Storm is this amazing voice

799
01:02:12,624 --> 01:02:17,771
actor, an amazing stunt man, and he's basically
six and a half feet tall, 350 pounds of muscle,

800
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:26,300
and braided dreadlocks, big black martial artist,
and we didn't meet him doing VO. We met him in a

801
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,491
D&amp;D game.

802
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:31,071
MATT: Yeah. He did all the mocap for Godzilla in
the recent Godzilla movie.

803
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:36,993
TALIESIN: He was Colossus in Deadpool as the mocap
actor. And, like, "Oh, God, that's T.J. from D&amp;D!

804
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:41,553
"What-- yo! What are you doing here?"

805
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:45,047
MATT: He was the dungeon master. He had all the
books, and was like, "All right, we're making

806
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:46,389
"characters. Sit down."

807
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:50,659
TALIESIN: Sundays, karate in the park. Saturday,
D&amp;D.

808
01:02:50,659 --> 01:02:55,231
MATT: It's always been diverse, and it's
continuing to grow more and more so as more people

809
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:00,081
have the opportunity to be exposed to it. Now it's
a cool thing to talk about again, which is great.

810
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:04,877
I'm excited to see where it goes from here.
Nothing makes me more excited than having people

811
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:12,096
send me pictures of their game group. Some of them
are a whole spread of ethnicities, and varying sexes--

812
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:14,306
TALIESIN: Someone's parents are playing.

813
01:03:14,306 --> 01:03:17,522
MATT: Yeah. It's a family thing! I've seen so many
people that, like, their kids and their parents

814
01:03:17,522 --> 01:03:21,367
play together now, and it's this great bonding
experience with the family core. There isn't a lot

815
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:25,847
of opportunity for people to enjoy something as a
family quite like this.

816
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:33,068
TALIESIN: My younger older brother's a dungeon
master, and my younger younger brother is playing

817
01:03:33,068 --> 01:03:35,187
now with his friends in Colorado.

818
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,387
MATT: (maniacal laugh)

819
01:03:37,387 --> 01:03:39,973
TALIESIN: Should we keep going?

820
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:44,238
MATT: We've got two more-- we're supposed to rush
over to our signing, it's 1:02. One more quick

821
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,967
question. Taliesin, you've got it.

822
01:03:45,967 --> 01:03:49,488
TALIESIN: Okay. I know I'm just going to feel
guilty no matter who I pick, but-- you in the

823
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:50,997
back. Yes, you.

824
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:57,508
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. When you guys started
broadcasting, I thought, "Oh, that's cool. We

825
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:08,121
"should do one too." [inaudible] We have nine
people. They all keep coming back. Everyone has a

826
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:16,229
lot of fun. I'm so overwhelmed sometimes when
we've got NPCs [inaudible]. So I've tried to do

827
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:18,858
things like roll all their initiatives ahead of
time--

828
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:21,189
MATT: That's a way to do it, yeah.

829
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:27,277
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is there anything else I can do
to try to help? They're all having fun, I'm having

830
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:28,315
fun, but--

831
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:33,975
TALIESIN: Your hourglass thing that you do every
now and then is just the meanest thing on earth.

832
01:04:33,975 --> 01:04:37,207
There's always that. The chess clock.

833
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:43,728
MATT: Putting a timer and giving people a very
limited period of time to succeed or decide is

834
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:49,022
always fun. Doing the initiative order ahead of
time is great. Whatever you can do to reduce the

835
01:04:49,022 --> 01:04:54,019
amount of rolls everyone has to make, or doing
group rolls. Like if they have to do a group

836
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:58,849
stealth check, designate somebody in the group
that is the designated roller for that

837
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:02,217
circumstance, who does like three rolls, average
them out. You can find ways to keep those a little

838
01:05:02,217 --> 01:05:08,186
more streamlined and creatively come up with ways
to help you do that. Also, you can have two DMs. I

839
01:05:08,186 --> 01:05:12,556
ran a game for a couple years with me and my
friend Zach Hanks both co-DMed, which allowed us

840
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:15,907
both to get together to write the stories. Having
someone to bounce story ideas off, which means you

841
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:17,527
construct cooler ideas.

842
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:21,037
TALIESIN: There would be 20 minutes a game where
it would just be him and Zach having NPC

843
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:23,671
conversations between each other while the rest of
us were going--

844
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:31,400
MATT: Which helps, because then you have half as
many NPCs. You designate an NPC to one or the

845
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,867
other, and that person always deals with that NPC.

846
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:38,957
TALIESIN: He's just an angrily good voice actor,
also. Zach's so talented. Oh god.

847
01:05:38,957 --> 01:05:44,506
MATT: Also, you have one person handling the music
while you're setting a scene or vice versa. Or

848
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:50,073
while you're tracking initiative and whose turn order it
is, he's handling the monster combat rounds.

849
01:05:50,073 --> 01:05:54,634
Having a co-DM can be a really good way to
alleviate some of that pressure, and plus you have

850
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:56,051
a partner in crime now.

851
01:05:56,051 --> 01:06:01,408
TALIESIN: You only had like five players in that
game. That was nothing. That was six players?

852
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:04,148
MATT: Five players. Six and then Sean left.

853
01:06:04,148 --> 01:06:07,389
TALIESIN: Okay, and then Marisha came in to
replace him. Okay, yeah, five.

854
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:10,968
MATT: Guys, we are over time for our panel. Thank
you so much for hanging.

855
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,356
TALIESIN: We'll see you at the signing.

856
01:06:13,356 --> 01:06:20,279
MATT: Please don't be pained if we're a little
pressed. We have a lot of people we want to get

857
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:21,928
through. We want to make sure everyone gets
signed, and we have--

858
01:06:21,928 --> 01:06:24,848
TALIESIN: We're so sorry if we go a little faster
than normal. We do apologize.

859
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:27,186
MATT: We're trying. We'll shake hands. We love you
guys. See you in a minute.

860
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:36,038
[light piano music]

861
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:44,726
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So I just got back from a
Critical Role panel and I asked Taliesin if he had

862
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:51,658
heard everything that people said during his
resurrection. I rolled a persuasion check with

863
01:06:51,658 --> 01:06:58,428
advantage because of my wink. I got a whisper and
he totally said--

864
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:49,541
[light piano music]
