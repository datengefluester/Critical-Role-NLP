1
00:00:00,806 --> 00:00:07,844
SAM: Hello, and welcome to Critical Role, with me,
Sam Riegel. Everyone else is away in various

2
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:13,812
places so I'm the host for tonight, I'm running a
one-off one-shot with my friends-- I hope they're

3
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,107
my friends--

4
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,312
H MICHAEL: Yep!

5
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:21,740
SAM: We have-- yeah, we'll see. I have lots of
announcements and it's up to me to do them all, so

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,452
I'll dive right in. First one I'll need your help
with. Tonight's sponsor for Critical Role is Star

7
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:34,807
Wars Battlefront II! Star Wars Battlefront II

8
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:40,554

Iden Versio, commander of the Inferno Squad and

9
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,510

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,593
YURI: (sings the Imperial March)

11
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:49,125
SAM: Yeah. Multi-player mode allows you to battle
across all three Star Wars eras, fight

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:54,348
side-by-side with your favorite characters and
experience the thrilling dogfights of starfighter

13
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:58,530
battle. And this is where I need your help. Some
of the awesome things you can do in the game are

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,808
so cool they require sound effects. Like, for
instance, you can hurtle between the rooftops of

15
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,679
Theed in a speeding starfighter--

16
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,136
ALL: (zooming)

17
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,803
SAM: Thank you.

18
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,442
H MICHAEL: Flying sounds!

19
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,332
SAM: As Darth Maul you can raise your
lightsaber--

20
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,853
ALL: (deep humming)

21
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:17,559
SAM: --and slash through armies of clones.

22
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:19,779
ALL: (slashing)

23
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:25,994
SAM: You can also play as iconic Star Wars villains
and heroes, including Emperor Palpatine--

24
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:27,249
ALL: Ooh!

25
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:31,468
YURI: DIE!

26
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,551
SAM: That's better. Or Chewbacca--

27
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,927
ALL: (wookie noises)

28
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,037
SAM: Thank you. Okay, great.

29
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:38,242
(laughter)

30
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:42,175
SAM: It's available on PC, PS4, and XBox One
tomorrow November 17th, get it! Okay, next

31
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:48,458
announcement. Critical Role d20 sets are currently
sold out. Merch lord Arcade tells us they should

32
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,402

art book--

33
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,438
YURI: Sam, it's okay, everything's okay!

34
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,055
SAM: There's so many announcements! Usually we
spread this around, but none of you--

35
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:02,023
H MICHAEL: Do you not trust us to read these pieces of
paper?

36
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:04,539
SAM: Yeah, okay!

37
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:06,064
H MICHAEL: Oh boy.

38
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,520
SAM: H read, starting from art book there.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,005
H MICHAEL: Starting from art book, okay. All
right, here we go. Art book! Both standard and

40
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:18,676
deluxe editions available in the Alpha and Geek &amp;
Sundry store. The deluxe edition is going fast, so

41
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:24,825
act now! While supplies last! Or you will regret
it for the rest of your goddamn life.

42
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:27,759
NOELLE: That is what it says actually, wow!

43
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,152
(accented) Episode 71 to 85 of the

46
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:47,479
think I'm in those, so no rush.

47
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,115
MOLLY: Gosh. The Critical Role podcast -- I'm
assuming that's what CR stands for in this

48
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:59,236
context-- is now available through the Amazon
Alexa. If you have one, simply ask Alexa to "Open

"Critical Role" and get started. If you don't have
one, go get it so you can listen that easily. It

50
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,613
is available on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus,

51
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,648
YURI: No Alexa, not critical bowl, not critical
bowl!

52
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:16,474
MOLLY: No, Alexa, god damn it, Alexa.

56
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:35,352
YURI: For those who don't like to touch
your comics or turn the pages with your fingers.

57
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:39,144
AMY: Yeah. If you are at PAX Unplugged, make sure
to go see Taliesin, Liam, Matt, and Marisha, they

58
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:46,874
will be doing a panel in the main theater tomorrow
at 1:00 to 2:30pm Eastern Standard Time.

59
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:48,985
STEFANIE: She added the pm.

60
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:51,500
AMY: I did add the pm, that is the after--

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,770
YURI: What if it's am?

62
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:00,854
AMY: I almost can 100% swear it is not 1:00 to
2:30am. But we'll see. I can't stop you from

63
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,174
showing up at one am.

64
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,775
YURI: But then did you get this part?

65
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:10,237
AMY: Oh, and then, 5.30 to 7.30pm-- maybe-- in the
Queue hall, they will be doing an autograph

66
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:14,262
signing, it's going to be really exciting, and you
can say hi to them, and then they'll say hi back,

67
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:15,926
and they're all lovely people.

68
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,718
H MICHAEL: I do all of my autograph signings at
5:30 in the morning.

69
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,759
(laughter)

70
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,346
MOLLY: They're true fans.

71
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:32,044
YURI: Hashtag Force Grey finale in NYC, which I'm
assuming is New York City, on Saturday 11/18,

72
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:36,463
that's November 18th. Matt, Joe, Marisha--

73
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,870
SAM: You're just literally reading what's there.

74
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,808
YURI: I'm literally reading what's there. New
episode of Madness came out today on

75
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,118
projectalpha.com!

76
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,224
ALL: Wow!

77
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:49,150
YURI: See, you left that for the Hatter!

78
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,427
SAM: That's good.

79
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:55,276
YURI: We're already in sync, this is going to be
so awesome!

80
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,928
H MICHAEL: Do the thing where you throw the
paper.

81
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,602
YURI: Oh yeah. I'm going to hurt somebody.

82
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,836
AMY: You can't hurt steel.

83
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:07,795
SAM: Okay, so that's the announcements, you guys
have anything else you would like to add or plug?

84
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:11,665
NOELLE: I would like to announce that you are
doing a great job, Sam. We believe in you and we're

85
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:12,589
so excited.

86
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,636
AMY: Half the job of being a good boss is knowing
how to delegate.

87
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:15,914
SAM: That's true.

88
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:22,452
YURI: No matter what goes down from this point on,
I think we can call this a success.

89
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:26,978
SAM: I'll just go quickly around the room for
people who don't know you fine people. I think in

90
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:31,773
chat there's going to be links to your Twitters
and all that stuff, but this is H Michael Croner

91
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:38,616
over here, a funny man. This is Noelle Stevenson,
a funny lady, this is Molly Ostertag, this is

92
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,619
Sophia Sarah--

93
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,048
MOLLY: I'm not a funny lady.

94
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:44,504
STEFANIE: We're having our own personal D&amp;D
night.

95
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:49,226
SAM: You guys are also funny people, you're also
funny people. Amy Vorpahl and Yuri Lowenthal, also

96
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:55,421
funny people and they're all here to help play a
game, this is only my second time ever dungeon

97
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:02,127
mastering, so forgive me if I suck, and I think
we're ready to dive into tonight's episode--

98
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,678
ALL: Yeah!

99
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,495
SAM: Of Critical Role!

100
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,034
(cheering)

101
00:06:07,034 --> 00:07:36,975
[dramatic music]

102
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:42,161
SAM: Hi and welcome back everyone, welcome to
tonight's show, all right, so we'll just dive in--

103
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,276
YURI: I thought you said welcome to the Tonight
Show.

104
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:47,483
SAM: Welcome to the Tonight Show, I'm your host
Johnny Carson. All right, we're just going to dive

105
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:57,366
in, and see how it goes. (clears throat) Once
upon a cruise somewhere in the seven seas, a

106
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,418
peaceful three-masted ship sways towards-- fuck.

107
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:02,206
(laughter)

108
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:05,950
YURI: Iceberg!

109
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,930
H MICHAEL: Oh my god, I was transported for like
five seconds.

110
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,931
SAM: A peaceful three-masted ship sways toward the
horizon. Below deck, the state rooms are empty,

111
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:21,790
save the banquet hall on dining deck which glows
with chandelier light, buzzing with excited

112
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,414
guests. The decor is frilly, tables adorned with
flowers, hors d'oeuvres, drinks and life-sized ice

113
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:33,594
sculptures showing naked couples locked in
romantic poses. An eager crowd huddles around the

114
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:37,879
dance floor, cruisers of all ages and
backgrounds-- humans, elves, dwarves, even a

115
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,034
giant, and among them are you all, formally clad,
wearing name-tags and presenting your best

116
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:48,457
posture. You suddenly see a hulking ten-foot
monster with sunken red eyes and a ferocious

117
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:53,570
toothy muzzle! If you saw him anywhere else you
would probably run, but somehow his pink leisure

118
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,937
suit and cheesy smile erases any hint of threat.
Everyone follows him with expectant happy

119
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,244
expressions. I forgot to hit play on the music--

120
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,015
(music plays)

121
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,345
ALL: Aww!

122
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,849
NOELLE: How tasteful.

123
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:11,406
SAM: He walks to the center of the dance hall and
addresses you all. "Welcome to the Storybook Love

124
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:19,316
"Singles' Cruise. I shall be your cruise director
aboard the SS Public Domain for four amorous days

125
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:26,510
"and nights. My name is Beast. And as you may have
read in my fairytale, I know a thing or two about

126
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:33,617
"finding romance in unexpected places." He glances
over to Beauty, a gorgeous young woman in a

127
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:43,276
ballgown, who laughs politely and curtsies back.
"Rawr, am I right?" The crowd chuckles politely.

128
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:44,790
(laughter)

129
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,921
SAM: "The purpose of this cruise is simple: you
are all single on a quest for true love, and I

130
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:54,370
"will not stop until at least one couple finds
their storybook happy ending. Think it can't

131
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,913
"happen? Well have you ever heard of the old woman
who lived in a shoe, who had so many kids she

132
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:04,840
"didn't know what to do? She met her husband right
here on this ship. Some of you have cruised with

133
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,910
"us before, so you know the drill, and all of my
corny jokes. Ah, Hansel, Gretel, good to see you

134
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:17,081
"again. Easy on the gingerbread tonight. Aladdin!
Still stealing hearts, I see. Oop, Big Bad Wolf is

135
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,650
"here, ladies, hope you didn't wear red dresses!"

136
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,898
AMY: Oh ho ho!

137
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:27,914
SAM: "I kid, I kid. We'll be dining and dancing
at sea for another day, and then arrive on

138
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:33,926
"Pleasure Island, where you'll go on romantic
excursions, culminating in the famous Hot Coal

'getting to know you' exercise called 'speed

140

"'dating.' We'll pair you up according to those
questionnaires we had you fill out, and give you

141
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:51,638
"90 seconds to meet and see if there's any
chemistry. If there isn't, no big deal, there's

142
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:57,378
"plenty more chances. But if you do sense a spark,
let me know, and we'll pair you up again. So,

143
00:10:57,378 --> 00:11:03,354
"let's get started!" Can you guys all roll a d20
and tell me what you've rolled?

144
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:07,149
H MICHAEL: I'm an eight.

145
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,391
SAM: Okay.

146
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,599
NOELLE: Ten.

147
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:10,885
MOLLY: 18.

148
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:12,332
SAM: Wait, say that again?

149
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:13,379
MOLLY: 18.

150
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,645
SAM: Okay.

151
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,741
STEFANIE: 13.

152
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,895
AMY: Nine.

153
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,147
YURI: Anybody who knows me won't be surprised,
two.

154
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,339
SAM: Okay.

155
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,349
H MICHAEL: Does one of us just die?

156
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,426
SAM: Yes.

157
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:25,969
NOELLE: I think I know which one--

158
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:35,224
SAM: Okay. "Let's get started, shall we? The first
pair shall be Peter Pan and the Queen of Hearts."

159
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:41,935
Peter Pan steps forward, small, lithe,
half-elf, handsome, with a very eager expression.

160
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:48,638
Also, the Queen of Hearts steps forward, a fierce,
hulking woman. She cracks her knuckles and grips

161
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:56,083
her dented royal scepter. They face together. "All
right, everyone, I'm going to give you 90 seconds

162
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:03,623
"to ask each other questions about former
relationships, goals, desires, pet peeves, getting

163
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:08,864
"to know you stuff. It's all up to you, if you'd
like, I gave you some sample questions if you get

164
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:16,978
"stuck, but you don't need to use them. Just in
case, right? And the clock will begin--" Holy

165
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:21,853
shit, I need a timing device! Fuck it, I'll just
count in my head.

166
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:25,334
YURI: If only that stupid rabbit were here!

167
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,804
H MICHAEL: You don't have a phone with a timer on
it?

168
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,088
SAM: I guess I do, right?

169
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,785
NOELLE: You could count out loud if you would
like?

170
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:37,277
SAM: The clock button, right? Okay. Oh, there's a
stopwatch, okay, got it, ready? "Let us begin the

171
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:38,614
"clock now."

172
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:46,613
AMY: I'd like to take charge here, as I am ready
for anything! Do you prefer the strong women?

173
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:54,375
NOELLE: Yeah, I would say I'm really into strong
women. I do very well with strong women, strong

174
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:59,338
women everywhere love me, you know? I'm very
charming, everyone finds me very charming. And I

175
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:04,104
keep stealing glances, I'm very distracted
clearly, stealing glances at Wendy across the

176
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:09,507
room, who I've realized is here. And trying to
appear engaged.

177
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:12,991
AMY: Who the hell are you distracted by?

178
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:19,908
NOELLE: I'm not, I'm here, it's just us two, we're
the only people in the room right now, girl. Tell me

179
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:23,984
about yourself, as in how you will die?

180
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:27,003
(laughter)

181
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,666
NOELLE: Do you ever think about such things?

182
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,537
H MICHAEL: That's serious game.

183
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:41,155
AMY: Yeah, how fucking dare you! I shall live
forever and if I do ever die I will be the owner

184
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:47,449
of all of the kingdoms in all the land and I will
die of old age well after you, my pet!

185
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:52,900
NOELLE: You know, I really like that in a woman, a
woman who never dies? I also intend to never die,

186
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,874
because I'm never going to die, I believe that.

187
00:13:56,874 --> 00:14:01,713
AMY: What was your last relationship with a very
strong woman?

188
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:11,856
NOELLE: I have myself dated many, many, many, many
strong women. Don't worry, I dated, uh, many--

189
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:15,436
SAM: "And that's time, everyone! Excellent"

190
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,564
NOELLE: I think we hit it off!

191
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,454
SAM: "Yes. We'll talk later and see if there was
any chemistry--"

192
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,961
AMY: I'm conflicted!

193
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:27,684
SAM: "All right, let's go to the next pairing,
shall we? That was excellent. The next pairing

194
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:36,954
"will be The Hatter and Wendy Darling, just two
young singles on a cruise looking for love." The

195
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:42,516
Hatter steps forward, a tiny halfling, little bit
loopy with big poofy hat and wild bloodshot eyes.

196
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:50,621
Wendy is strikingly beautiful, with dangerous dark
features, blood red lipstick and a wolf-fur cape.

197
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:57,206
"All right, I will start my timing device, and ask
away."

198
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,895
YURI: Did you kill that wolf yourself?

199
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,181
MOLLY: I did.

200
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:04,815
YURI: My god, that's so cool. You know, my spirit
animal is a fox, so I really don't care about wolves.

201
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:09,692
MOLLY: Yes, I've only killed a few foxes. Also
friends, both--

202
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,453
YURI: That's also cool.

203
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,593
MOLLY: I haven't seen you here before.

204
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,035
YURI: No, this is my first time.

205
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:16,086
MOLLY: I've been a few times.

206
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,007
YURI: Really?

207
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,821
MOLLY: It's quite a lovely experience, I have to
say.

208
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,137
YURI: What keeps bringing you back?

209
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,434
MOLLY: Just, you know?

210
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:22,842
YURI: Is it the canapes?

211
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:24,278
MOLLY: No, did you taste them?

212
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,060
YURI: No.

213
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,065
MOLLY: Well, don't!

214
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:26,694
YURI: Okay!

215
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:31,371
MOLLY: All right! I simply just like new
experiences, and there's always an interesting

216
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:38,130
cast of characters, sometimes people who I'd
rather not be here. Anyway, what is your best or

217
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,508
most terrible memory? I just looked at the sheet,
just wondering.

218
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:46,515
YURI: Oh, my best and my worst memory are pretty
much one and the same.

219
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:47,465
MOLLY: Really?

220
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:54,604
YURI: Yeah, I was, you know, talking about
romantic things, I was being romantic with a

221
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,877
couple of friends of mine in a portable hole--

222
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:57,972
MOLLY: Several!

223
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:58,934
YURI: And several--

224
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,051
MOLLY: I like the sound of that.

225
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,757
YURI: Yeah, you know, we thought it would be fun,
but there's only so much air in a portable hole.

226
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:08,523
MOLLY: Don't have an orgy in a portable hole.
That's my advice. From me to you.

227
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:15,087
YURI: Unless you're really into like (choking
noises). And we were, so it worked out.

228
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,643
MOLLY: That does sound terrible and best.

229
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,427
YURI: We almost died but it was amazing. So that's
why it's the best and worst.

230
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:21,621
MOLLY: I think I like you.

231
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,141
YURI: I think I like you!

232
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:24,072
MOLLY: Interesting.

233
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:29,507
SAM: "And time. I think we have a potential match
here, excellent excellent. I'll write that down,

234
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:40,641
"okay. And our next match for the evening will be
Scarecrow and Goldilocks. Please come out to the

235
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:46,919
"table." The Scarecrow stands six foot six, is
lanky, wobbly and stuffed with straw. His eyes are

236
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:52,649
a little crossed. Goldilocks steps forward, a
strong young human girl in a pink dress. She

237
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,943
belches as she steps forward to meet her match.

238
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,460
STEFANIE: (belch)

239
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,666
SAM: "All right, I will start the clock, and
please, leave your hearts and minds open to new

240
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,751
"adventures."

241
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:09,257
H MICHAEL: Hi, do you currently love anyone, or
are you open to loving someone new?

242
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:16,747
STEFANIE: I'm totally open to loving someone new.
My last relationship ended so bad, he was just not

243
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,501
just right, so--

244
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,205
H MICHAEL: Oh, who was he?

245
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,526
STEFANIE: Oh, you don't know him, he's (laughs) I
don't really want to get into it.

246
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:25,832
H MICHAEL: Okay.

247
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,211
STEFANIE: Anyway, that's why I went brunette
now--

248
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,654
H MICHAEL: Oh, it looks good on your head.

249
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:33,523
STEFANIE: Thank you, your head looks good on your
straw body.

250
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:38,782
H MICHAEL: Thanks, I just sewed it up so I'm
wearing the hat to cover up the new seam.

251
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,893
STEFANIE: Huff, what is that?

252
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:47,782
H MICHAEL: Huh? Oh, this is a brand of scarecrow
hat, it's super popular in this town I've been in.

253
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:48,957
STEFANIE: Oh, are you sponsored?

254
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:49,753
H MICHAEL: Yeah.

255
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,053
STEFANIE: Wow, a sponsored scarecrow!

256
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,715
H MICHAEL: I'm pretty nimble and shit, so I do
like skateboarding and stuff when I'm not--

257
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:55,156
STEFANIE: Really?

258
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,066
H MICHAEL: Yeah.

259
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,194
STEFANIE: I guess that's a good use for your
floppy body.

260
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:03,742
H MICHAEL: Yeah, it's hard to get work when you're
flammable, you can't work in kitchens and shit.

261
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,150
STEFANIE: Do you run hot?

262
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,283
H MICHAEL: No, I have no body temperature
whatsoever, but if you run cold--

263
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:16,231
STEFANIE: I hate it too hot, and too cold, so I
don't know. I'm trying to get rid of my standards

264
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:20,459
for just right and just be open. I'd be open to
maybe having a fling, but I don't know, I'm not

265
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:21,506
really sure.

266
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:27,497
H MICHAEL: That's great, my last girlfriend was a
swarm of flying monkeys, and so I'm super open as well.

267
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,500
STEFANIE: That could be fun.

268
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:37,771
H MICHAEL: No. Objectively no. Because even if
you're connecting with one, others are over,

269
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,066
shitting on you.

270
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,846
STEFANIE: Hey, some people are into that.

271
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,378
H MICHAEL: I'm not. I'm absorbent.

272
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:50,666
SAM: "All right, that was excellent, everybody.
Listen, congratulations on getting to know each

273
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:55,055
"other. We're going to continue with other
couples." And they do, you guys go back, have more

274
00:18:55,055 --> 00:19:01,100
drinks, sip on your cocktails, etc. While you're
all being matched up in different pairs, the rest

275
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,005
of the room is going on speed dates of their own.
Sleeping Beauty is paired up with Jack, but he

276
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:12,262
keeps talking about his beanstalk and she dozes
off. The cute little Hunchback of Notre Dame tries

277
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:19,040
to get a word in edgewise with the very bossy Mary
Mary Quite Contrary. And then Little Miss Muffett

278
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,880
hits it off with Humpty Dumpty. It's great. At the
end of it all, the Beast returns. "Okay, well done,

279
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,509
"everyone. I tried speed-dating when I was younger,
but my dates would always scream and run away

280
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:37,630
"before the clock started, right, Beauty?" So he
turns over to Beauty, she forces a smile and

281
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,096
waves. "Okay, now go refresh those cocktails,
we'll have more romantic activities in a few

282
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:49,184
"minutes, and if anyone sensed a spark of chemistry
in that last exercise, come over and let me know,

283
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:54,937
"I'll be by the bar." As the Beast leaves, the
guests mill about, refill their drinks over at the

284
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,759
bar, what would you guys like to do?

285
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:04,799
MOLLY: Keeping her eyes on Peter Pan to see if
he's watching, Wendy walks over to the Beast and

286
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,310
says, hello handsome.

287
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,674
SAM: "Who, me? I'm taken, but thank you."

288
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:14,119
MOLLY: Oh, I know. I wanted to let you know I
think the Hatter's quite lovely.

289
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,374
SAM: "Oh yes? So that's a potential match?"

290
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:18,150
MOLLY: You can put that down as a check,
definitely.

291
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,332
SAM: "We'll schedule an excursion maybe with the
two of you later."

292
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,620
MOLLY: Love it.

293
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,245
SAM: "Let me write this here so I won't lose it."

294
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:29,924
MOLLY: I put on the form-- Peter Pan is here.

295
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:30,928
SAM: "Yes?"

296
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:34,184
MOLLY: I requested that he not be here when
I am.

297
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:40,930
SAM: "I can't-- We tried to reschedule Peter for
another cruise, but he had a thing, apparently, so

298
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,046
"he needed to come on this one. And who am I to
turn away a customer? Don't worry, we won't pair

299
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:50,514
"you up together. We'll try to keep you as far
apart as we can. We're sensitive to exes on this

300
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:55,215
"vessel, and everyone here is just here to 
have a fun time, including Peter."

301
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,124
MOLLY: All right.

302
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,162
SAM: "If you'd like me to have a word with him, I
can."

303
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,415
MOLLY: (sighs) Just--

304
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:01,642
SAM: "Or a message you'd like me to--"

305
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:02,730
MOLLY: It's fine.

306
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,468
SAM: "It's fine?"

307
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:04,710
MOLLY: I can handle him.

308
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,563
SAM: "All right. Here, take a drink ticket on
me."

309
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:11,481
MOLLY: Oh! She takes it and strides away to the
bar.

310
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:12,794
SAM: "All right, excellent."

311
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:15,395
H MICHAEL: I'd like to approach the Queen of
Hearts.

312
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:16,992
SAM: Sure, go ahead.

313
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:21,146
H MICHAEL: Hey, do you currently love anyone or
are open to loving someone new?

314
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:31,374
AMY: I need some advice. I don't currently love
anyone and I'm looking for the new king of my

315
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,391
kingdom.

316
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,017
H MICHAEL: Oh! That'd be cool.

317
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:45,228
AMY: Yes. But look. I'm hoping-- I know that I'm a
perfect woman, but it seems as though the men I'm

318
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:51,479
interested in are wandering eyes. Do you have any
advice? Should I be myself or should I femme it up?

319
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:59,514
H MICHAEL: You're literally attracted to wandering
eyes? I feel like you should date people with

320
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:00,963
whole bodies.

321
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:05,687
AMY: Oh! I see what you're saying. Semantics are
important.

322
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:07,611
H MICHAEL: I'm sorry, I don't catch onto stuff
good.

323
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:14,712
AMY: You're doing great. I know the men that
I want to date are little, scrawny yes-men. But

324
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:21,569
the ones that they are interested in, well, they
seem a little smaller and daintier. Should I act

325
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,996
dainty?

326
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:30,144
H MICHAEL: I will say that when you did that
movement, I did become very aroused. Which is hard

327
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,432
for me because I don't have blood.

328
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,965
AMY: Is it very hard for you?

329
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:45,683
(increasingly awkward laughter)

330
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:48,334
H MICHAEL: Okay! This is good.

331
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:52,454
AMY: We weren't even instructed to and yet we made
a connection.

332
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:58,855
H MICHAEL: (loudly laughs) You got a vein coming
out of your face!

333
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,882
(laughter)

334
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:03,925
STEFANIE: I would like to approach the bar.

335
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:11,080
SAM: The bar? All right. There is a half-elf
bartender behind the bar, a nice older gentleman.

336
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,825
"Hello! May I help you?"

337
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:17,910
STEFANIE: Yes. I don't know if you just heard this
conversation behind me, but I absolutely need a drink.

338
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:23,031
MOLLY: Wendy looks over because she's at the bar
too and says: already?

339
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:29,518
STEFANIE: Oh, yeah! Question: they were included
on the trip price, right? It's all-you-can-drink?

340
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:34,898
SAM: "You get standard rail drinks like ale and
mead. But if you want anything--"

341
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:36,278
STEFANIE: What about Cristal?

342
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:43,002
SAM: "Cristal? That would be a premium beverage
that you would have to pay additional for."

343
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:44,345
STEFANIE: I'm a premium person.

344
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:45,647
MOLLY: I got you.

345
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:46,666
STEFANIE: Thanks!

346
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,070
MOLLY: It can be hard on these things, I know.

347
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,935
STEFANIE: Does your ticket cover Cristal?

348
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,693
SAM: "Oh, you have a drink ticket?"

349
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:53,692
MOLLY: I do.

350
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:56,017
SAM: "Ordinarily it would be two gold, but yes, I'll
take this."

351
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,052
MOLLY: Here you go. Very good. That's right.

352
00:23:58,052 --> 00:23:59,187
SAM: He hands you your drink.

353
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:04,891
STEFANIE: Well, I have to get her a drink now too,
so you can put that on my tab. What would you like?

354
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:06,012
MOLLY: Oh, just a wine.

355
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:06,903
STEFANIE: A wine.

356
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,293
MOLLY: A rose. Thank you!

357
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,253
SAM: "We have a lovely sparkling rose."

358
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:12,677
STEFANIE: Yeah, your top shelf.

359
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:14,895
SAM: "Top shelf? Well."

360
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:16,073
MOLLY: Thank you!

361
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:18,717
SAM: He goes and gets a dusty bottle and blows it
off, pours you another glass.

362
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:21,140
STEFANIE: So your ex is here?

363
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,838
MOLLY: It's a bit of a nightmare.

364
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,518
STEFANIE: That blows.

365
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:28,938
MOLLY: The men here are literal monsters. I don't
know if you noticed, I mean, some are literally

366
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,311
monsters.

367
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:36,443
STEFANIE: I made sure that Prince Charming was not
on this boat because that would be awful.

368
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,811
MOLLY: Oh, did you and him--?

369
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,991
STEFANIE: Yeah. Not right.

370
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:44,526
MOLLY: What's Peter doing? Wendy looks over to
glare at him.

371
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:50,474
NOELLE: Standing, having a drink, there's some
women standing near me and I am pretending to be

372
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:55,779
involved in the conversation they're in, but
they're not talking to me. I'm striking a pose and

373
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:58,475
looking charming, as usual.

374
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:00,852
STEFANIE: He's not that cute, don't worry about
it.

375
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:03,417
MOLLY: You know, I was into him when I was a kid.

376
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,076
STEFANIE: So were we all. Ugh. Grow up.

377
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:10,554
MOLLY: I know! Sometimes you have to grow up and
become an adult.

378
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:14,876
NOELLE: I see both glance over to me and I'm like,
okay. And so I slide up to the bar and I'm like:

379
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:19,121
Oh hey! You said your name was Goldilocks? Oh
Wendy, you're here too? I didn't even see you

380
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:20,370
there. Wow.

381
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,981
MOLLY: All right, Peter. We don't have to play the
little game each time. I was literally on the

382
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,576
stage doing speed dating and you definitely saw
me.

383
00:25:26,576 --> 00:25:34,538
NOELLE: Hey. So what's your deal? What's up with
you? Wow, this is encouraging. This is an

384
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,436
encouraging look I'm getting right now from you.

385
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,950
STEFANIE: Do you have a drink ticket?

386
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,135
NOELLE: For you, I have so many drink tickets.

387
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:47,144
H MICHAEL: Not sensing the tension in this
conversation <i>at all</i>, the Scarecrow walks right

388
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:52,370
into the middle of it and talks to Wendy. Hi! Do
you currently love anyone and are you open to

389
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,025
loving someone new?

390
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:55,119
MOLLY: Huh.

391
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,248
NOELLE: All right, look--

392
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:57,455
MOLLY: I'm always open.

393
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,274
NOELLE: We're in the middle of something, you
could just play cool.

394
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:02,919
H MICHAEL: What?

395
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:03,966
NOELLE: Hey.

396
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:07,923
H MICHAEL: Well, I don't have blood so I have to
because I naturally run very cold. I'm always

397
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:11,097
the temperature of my air.

398
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:14,603
NOELLE: Yeah, I noticed that some sparks are
really flying with you and the Queen of Hearts. In

399
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,509
fact, so many sparks that I was a little
worried you'd burst into flames.

400
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,515
H MICHAEL: I'm not a big sparks guy!

401
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:22,266
NOELLE: So maybe don't go over
there. You're right. That was a bad metaphor.

402
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,690
Don't do that. How are you doing?

403
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,845
H MICHAEL: Confused.

404
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,712
NOELLE: Yeah. Same, always.

405
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,963
H MICHAEL: Me too!

406
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:29,888
NOELLE: You seem cool.

407
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,892
H MICHAEL: You seem cool!

408
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:31,683
NOELLE: You want to hang out?

409
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:32,353
H MICHAEL: Yeah!

410
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:33,173
NOELLE: Let's do it!

411
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,298
H MICHAEL: Okay. Let's have a walk!

412
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,522
NOELLE: Yeah! We're going for a walk.

413
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:36,723
SAM: All right.

414
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:38,660
H MICHAEL: Bye! I'll ask you about your love life
later.

415
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,647
SAM: There's a little side deck off the banquet
hall that you can see the rolling waves and stuff if

416
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:47,900
you would like to go outside, or you can stay in
the banquet hall.

417
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:49,256
NOELLE: You want to go out and look at the rolling
waves?

418
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:50,495
H MICHAEL: Fuck yeah!

419
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:53,868
NOELLE: I'm mostly into ladies, but I'm also into
dudes. What about you? Are you into dudes at all?

420
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:57,838
I just want to be buddies.

421
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,215
H MICHAEL: I don't know.

422
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,588
NOELLE: You know, it's whatever you want.

423
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:01,751
H MICHAEL: I'm sorry.

424
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:02,880
NOELLE: We're on a singles' cruise.

425
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,624
H MICHAEL: God, I'm batting a thousand today.

426
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:09,307
NOELLE: You seem like you'd be down for anything.
You'd be a very good listener.

427
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:12,265
H MICHAEL: I really am! My bar is so low these
days.

428
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:17,605
NOELLE: I've got a lot to work through, but you
seem like you're a really big heart.

429
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:24,883
H MICHAEL: Thank you! I'm missing other organs, so
yeah, I'm pretty much running on heart these days.

430
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,641
NOELLE: What other organs are you missing?

431
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:27,834
H MICHAEL: Brain.

432
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:32,187
NOELLE: Really? I had no idea. I would not have
guessed that at all. That's so interesting.

433
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:36,765
H MICHAEL: I'm actually the most high-functioning
non-brain-equipped thing that I know.

434
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,682
NOELLE: I can see that. You say that, and I
totally see that. Hey, do me a favor. Is Wendy

435
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,339
looking over here at all?

436
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:47,108
H MICHAEL: She's pretending not to but she's like
side-eyeing you very hard.

437
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:50,575
NOELLE: Yeah. Awesome. So let's keep talking.

438
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:54,918
SAM: So they walk towards the window in the porch.
Yes?

439
00:27:54,918 --> 00:28:02,099
STEFANIE: Oh, I just was about to say, I go over
to the side of the ship to puke from this conversation. I

440
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,657
wanted to bring Wendy with me and then I don't. I
was like: Oh man, that sounds really awful, what

441
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:13,305
you went through. It sounds like it was a long
time period together. That sucks that he's here.

442
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:18,785
MOLLY: You know, it's fine. I'm very past it. I've
had a lot of adventures, a lot of travels since

443
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:25,411
then. How about you? Any-- well, Prince Charming? He's a
bad ex? Yeah?

444
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,862
STEFANIE: Yeah.

445
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:28,184
MOLLY: I've heard he's a real dick.

446
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:33,263
SAM: As they talk, the Mad Hatter is mingling
about, I imagine.

447
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:35,795
YURI: People don't notice me because I'm so
short.

448
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,213
SAM: Yes. And actually--

449
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,237
YURI: I could pop up at any time.

450
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:47,298
SAM: Actually, a very tipsy Big Bad Wolf is
staggering across the room, knocks clean into you,

451
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:54,045
doesn't say sorry, just keeps going. He's seven
feet tall. He's loud. His breath reeks of cherry

452
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:57,078
brandy. He's walking across the room towards
Goldilocks.

453
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:59,565
YURI: Do I see that happen?

454
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,632
SAM: Yeah.

455
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:02,832
YURI: Hey, Goldilocks!

456
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:04,385
STEFANIE: What?

457
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:06,075
YURI: Goldilocks, someone's coming.

458
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,175
STEFANIE: What's coming?

459
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:10,158
YURI: It's me, baby! How are you? (laughs)

460
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:17,463
STEFANIE: Okay. I'm going to ask, on a scale of
one to ten, how good of an opener do you think

461
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:18,525
that is?

462
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:26,281
YURI: I don't even know what an opener is! That is
just the way I talk. No, that's me. That's-- oh.

463
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,613
See, I don't--

464
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:31,357
STEFANIE: Do you think that's appropriate for
ladies? Do you think you would ever get someone,

465
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:34,066
say, the Queen of Hearts, to put a mouth on
you?

466
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,008
YURI: It works on dudes. I don't see why it
shouldn't work on ladies!

467
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:45,575
SAM: Just then, the Big Bad Wolf interrupts your
conversation and says, "Goldie. Baby! What gives?

468
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:50,716
"I invited you to my birthday party last week. It
was a kegger, no show. What's up? You too good for

469
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:51,975
"the Big Bad Wolf?"

470
00:29:51,975 --> 00:30:00,843
STEFANIE: I'm allergic to beer, but I heard you
liked red, so I just thought I'd be a little tease.

471
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:05,221
SAM: He puts his paw on your shoulder and goes in
close.

472
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,711
STEFANIE: Where's my reaction? Shield.

473
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:10,817
SAM: Sure. You have a reaction. You're going
to cast Shield.

474
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,674
(laughter)

475
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:23,584
SAM: I will roll to see if I beat Shield. What is
your spell DC? Hold on. Goldilocks...

476
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,410
STEFANIE: 11.

477
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:33,565
SAM: No, I fail. The Big Bad Wolf knocks straight
into the Shield and doesn't quite understand. He's

478
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:41,696
kind of drunk. He tries again. He just keeps
hitting this invisible wall. He's like, "Ugh! What

479
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,632
"the fuck? Come on! I'm just trying to talk to
you."

480
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,255
STEFANIE: I'm vegetarian.

481
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:47,985
SAM: "What does that have to do with anything?"

482
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:50,366
STEFANIE: Stop eating helpless creatures!

483
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:55,063
SAM: "Come on, baby. I could make you howl all
night. Come on."

484
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,251
STEFANIE: No!

485
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:59,624
SAM: "All right. Fine." He goes one more time and
hits the wall.

486
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,261
YURI: You know what you need, Big Bad Wolf? You
seem a little tense.

487
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,574
STEFANIE: Big Bad?

488
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:10,846
YURI: I'm helping you out here. Yeah, you know
what you need, Big Bad Wolf? You need a massage.

489
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:12,641
And I use my Massage cantrip.

490
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,122
NOELLE: What?

491
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,114
YURI: I mean, I can only get at his calf--

492
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:19,907
SAM: I think that's Message, but I'll allow it.

493
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:22,474
YURI: Message, Massage, whatever you want!

494
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:28,854
(laughter)

495
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:32,677
SAM: Hey. He's crazy, this guy. Who knows what
spells come out of this guy?

496
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,285
H MICHAEL: Wait, what's a cantrip?

497
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:36,289
SAM: It's a type of magical spell.

498
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:37,632
H MICHAEL: I don't know anything.

499
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:43,711
SAM: Neither do I! It's an easier spell to cast.
He has one called Message but he, in his

500
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:45,391
craziness, has reinterpreted--

501
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:48,602
YURI: It's just the way I pronounce things! It's a
<i>massage</i>.

502
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:57,055
SAM: So the Big Bad Wolf suddenly feels tension
relieving in his upper back and lower neck and

503
00:31:57,055 --> 00:32:01,786
also, your voice in his ear, telling him-- what
are you telling him?

504
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,144
YURI: Just relax, baby. Just relax!

505
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:10,006
SAM: "What? Oh, this is fucked up." He retreats.

506
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:11,758
YURI: (shouting) I'm on the Lito deck!

507
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:14,155
SAM: He's freaked out. He leaves in a huff.

508
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:21,957
STEFANIE: Hey, thanks, Mad Hatter, for using your
special Massage skills.

509
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:26,292
YURI: Oh, you're-- well, I was hitting on him.

510
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,646
STEFANIE: Oh, cool.

511
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:28,578
YURI: I'm sorry. Was there?

512
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:31,049
STEFANIE: No! Man, go do good. I think he's also
in the Lito deck.

513
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:35,685
AMY: Would you call yourself a tiny man?

514
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:41,141
YURI: Oh, I am <i>definitely</i> tiny! Nobody has ever
said ever once that I was tall.

515
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:49,247
AMY: That is very interesting to me. I thought you
were in a partnership with a hare?

516
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:54,309
YURI: Oh yes, you know, that guy. Hate that guy.
He always wants to know what time it is. He always

517
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,446
wants to talk about time. Well, I don't really
care about time. I really don't pay attention to

518
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:59,306
time. I would say that I live outside of time.

519
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:02,971
AMY: Well, I like that in a tiny man.

520
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:05,283
(laughter)

521
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:09,671
YURI: Well, I am a tiny man, and you are a big
woman--

522
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,644
AMY: Yeah, no shit!

523
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:20,575
YURI: We should get together. I have dated far
bigger people than you. And some creatures.

524
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:26,743
AMY: Oh my! Well, I'm a human and I like my men
small and agreeable.

525
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:29,031
YURI: I can be agreeable.

526
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:30,556
AMY: No. Yes, you can.

527
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:32,463
YURI: No, I can't. Yes, I can!

528
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:34,534
AMY: Very funny! (laughter)

529
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:40,159
SAM: The audience hushes as the Beast tries to get
your attention again. (clears throat) "All right,

530
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,378
"everyone all drinked up and ready for the next
exercise? Good."

531
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:47,599
H MICHAEL: Not understanding that an
announcement's about to happen, I walk up to the

532
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,571
Beast and go, hey, I just wanted to let you know
really quick. I think I have a potential match

533
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:57,501
with Peter Pan and Goldilocks and the Queen of
Hearts.

534
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,436
YURI: But we just haven't met yet!

535
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:05,500
H MICHAEL: Oh. Hey man! Are you currently in love
with anyone and are you open to loving someone new?

536
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,270
SAM: "Oh. We can do this later."

537
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,120
MOLLY: You don't have a match with me, just so you
know.

538
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,584
H MICHAEL: Yeah, I didn't say you.

539
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,616
MOLLY: Just put that down--

540
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:13,698
NOELLE: Back off.

541
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:14,853
H MICHAEL: Put it down?

542
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:20,566
SAM: "All right. I can see the drinks are flowing
tonight! Henrick, go easy on it from now on. Now

543
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:25,899
"it's time for our second big event. It's time to
learn the official dance of Storybook Love Singles'

544
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:32,738
"Cruise: The Electric Slide. And who better to
teach a clumsy oaf how to dance than my own

545
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:39,538
"bride? Here she is, the real animal of our
relationship, Beauty! Take it away!" Beauty rolls

546
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:45,592
her eyes at his stupid joke and strides onto the
dance floor. "Okay. Listen up, you scrubs! The

547
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:50,609
"Electric Slide is the most alluring and easy to
teach of the Slides. There's only five steps you

548

"got to remember. I need a volunteer. Who's it
going to be? Oh. You, Goldie! All right, get up

549
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:03,506
"here. Okay, the first step: You do the grapevine
to the right. One, two, three, four and tap your

550
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,972
"foot." Roll an acrobatics check.

551
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,760
STEFANIE: Roll an acrobatics?

552
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,338
SAM: An acrobatics ability check

553
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:17,759
STEFANIE: Let's see! It's eight.

554
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,112
SAM: Plus?

555
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:22,722
STEFANIE: Plus two. So it's a ten!

556
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:24,582
SAM: So you fail.

557
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:28,316
YURI: The Electric Slide is hard!

558
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:33,564
SAM: You try to do the move, but you go the wrong
way, you're on the wrong foot. You stumble into

559
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:40,565
Beauty, causing you both to stumble. "It's okay.
Let's try again, all right? Then you grapevine to

560
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:43,542
"the left one, two, three, four." Roll another
acrobatics check.

561
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:47,018
STEFANIE: That's another eight.

562
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:54,963
SAM: Okay, you stumble into her again. It's worse.
Her dress rips a little. It's awkward.

563
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:56,894
H MICHAEL: Woo!

564
00:35:56,894 --> 00:36:02,539
STEFANIE: That's inappropriate. I'm so sorry about
your dress, Belle. You're really great at dancing,

565
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:03,918
I don't mean to step on you.

566
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:10,646
SAM: "Yeah, if you don't mind, we're going to move
onto another helper, if that's all right. Please,

567
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:14,817
"go back down there and I'll get somebody else.
Anybody else want to try?"

568
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,037
YURI: Me! I am tiny, but lithe!

569
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:18,616
SAM: "Yes, you, small man!"

570
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,562
AMY: Bring the tinyman up, I'd love to see you
perform!

571
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:27,613
SAM: "Come on over. The Electric Slide is very
easy to do. Children can do it."

572
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:30,435
YURI: I am the same height as a child!

573
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:31,783
AMY: Hear hear!

574
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:36,448
SAM: "You first grapevine to the right, one, two,
three, four." Roll an acrobatics check.

575
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:41,155
YURI: 18 plus three.

576
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:48,341
SAM: Oh yeah! You all watch as the Mad Hatter
seems to already know this dance by heart. He goes

577
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:53,984
right, he goes left, he goes back, he goes
forward. He's got hip movements and swagger. He

578
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:58,312
does a little thing with his hair at the end. He
blows a kiss to the audience.

579
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,051
H MICHAEL: I'm excited to meet you!

580
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:07,097
SAM: The audience is enthralled, they applaud. As
the class goes on, everyone's having a good time

581
00:37:07,097 --> 00:37:18,475
learning the dance. Suddenly, and quite without
warning-- oh boy. The ship, which had been gently

582
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:24,867
gliding through the ocean, lurches to one side,
knocking glasses off tables and causing some of

583
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:29,173
the ice sculptures to shatter to the floor. Is
this working?

584
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:34,238
NOELLE: It's still so pleasing! Calming! But I
feel like something really bad is happening!

585
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:40,974
SAM: Yes! A crack echoes through the dining deck.
Beauty and Beast both seem concerned, surprised. A

586
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:46,388
moment of silence, everything seems calm and then
boom! Another, larger explosion rings out from

587
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:56,437
above you, rocking the ship violently to one side.
Everyone, please roll your d20s for a dexterity save.

588
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:58,269
NOELLE: Oh no!

589
00:37:58,269 --> 00:37:59,365
MOLLY: I failed!

590
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:00,978
SAM: What'd you get?

591
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:04,286
H MICHAEL: Nine plus one.

592
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,866
SAM: Okay, so ten for you. Yes, go on, Noelle?

593
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,172
NOELLE: That is a 21.

594
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,398
MOLLY: One!

595
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:11,423
STEFANIE: 19.

596
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,819
AMY: 12.

597
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,986
YURI: Six plus three, is the modifier? Nine.

598
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:20,732
SAM: Hatter and Wendy both fall to the floor.

599
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,824
AMY: Oh, the tinyman!

600
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:29,369
SAM: Wendy, actually, falls into some broken glass
and you take one hit point.

601
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,967
MOLLY: Can it be a cool little thing on my face?

602
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:35,023
SAM: Yes. On your face, it's pretty badass.

603
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:38,029
MOLLY: Yeah! I'm pissed off.

604
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:41,412
H MICHAEL: But your perfect complexion!

605
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:47,054
SAM: The explosions above grow faster and more
intense. Shouting and footsteps can be heard above

606
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:53,610
deck, screams of pain. Just then a sailor, one of
the crew, face bloody, runs down the steps into

607
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:59,352
the banquet hall yelling, "Beast! We're under
attack! The skipper's been badly injured!" Beast

608
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:03,503
says, "Attacked by whom?" "I don't know, but
they're flying the skull and crossbones!"

609
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:10,280
"Pirates? In these waters? Okay, everyone stay
below deck for your own safety. Beauty, you too."

610
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,611
Beauty protests. "No, I'm coming with you!"
(roars) "No, stay here!" says Beast.

611
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:18,318
MOLLY: I can deal with pirates! I've dealt with
pirates before.

612
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,548
SAM: "No, I can't risk your lives, you're my
paying customers. Please stay below deck." He

613
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:25,144
darts upstairs with the sailor.

614
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:31,355
NOELLE: I think this is part of the thing. I think
we can also date the pirates. This is awesome!

615
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:37,269
AMY: Anyone interferes with the chance that I
might find love tonight, they shall meet the end

616
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:44,355
of my bloody scepter! I am half-raging. I'm not
quite there yet.

617
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,940
NOELLE: How hot are these pirates?

618
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,981
SAM: You haven't seen any pirates yet.

619
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:50,329
MOLLY: I can deal with pirates.

620
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,689
YURI: What if they're dead pirates?

621
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,270
NOELLE: Ooh, even better!

622
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,749
YURI: So hot!

623
00:39:54,749 --> 00:40:00,537
H MICHAEL: Seeing Beauty standing alone, worried
about her husband, I approach. Hey, do you

624
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:03,530
currently love anyone and would you be interested
in loving someone new?

625
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,162
SAM: "I'm bleeding and cut."

626
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:10,979
H MICHAEL: Oh, I'm sorry. I pull some of my
stuffing out of my hip and I apply it to the cut

627
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:12,189
on her head.

628
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:15,583
SAM: "Oh, actually, that kind of feels okay." Roll
a medicine check.

629
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:22,738
H MICHAEL: Eight plus two.

630
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:28,655
SAM: Okay, so ten. Yeah, that feels good. It blots
out some of the blood and he feels weirdly

631
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,797
better.

632
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,309
H MICHAEL: I'm super absorbent!

633
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:34,688
SAM: "Thank you, strange man, I--"

634
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:36,325
H MICHAEL: Give it back when you're done, okay?

635
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:37,576
SAM: "It's soaked in blood. Are you sure?"

636
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:39,887
H MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm very moist inside.

637
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,444
YURI: I hope you don't get infected.

638
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:46,039
AMY: Will we all be exchanging liquids tonight?

639
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,366
H MICHAEL: I'm down!

640
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:57,808
SAM: Another shot fires. A cannon blasts through
the side of the hull into the banquet hall,

641
00:40:57,808 --> 00:41:05,361
splintering chairs and tables. Hold on-- yes, it
hits and kills Hansel.

642
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:08,660
YURI: Hansel, no!

643
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,903
SAM: Hansel is dead.

644
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:13,355
AMY: That was a small man that I had my heart set
on.

645
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,166
SAM: The cannon takes his head clean off.

646
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:23,537
H MICHAEL: Seeing Gretel standing alone near
Hansel, I approach. Hey, do you currently love

647
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:26,321
anyone and would you be open to loving someone
new?

648
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:29,073
SAM: She's just screaming.

649
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:35,401
STEFANIE: I pull aside Scarecrow and say: Let me
teach you something about when it's appropriate to

650
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:36,621
talk to a woman.

651
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,448
H MICHAEL: Okay, cool! When is it appropriate?

652
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:42,080
STEFANIE: Not when her brother just died in front
of her eyes.

653
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,912
NOELLE: I'm starting to think these pirates aren't
very sexy, you guys.

654
00:41:44,912 --> 00:41:50,236
SAM: The Princess and the Pea is screaming bloody
murder, she hasn't been hurt or anything, she's

655
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:55,518
just overreacting. The rest of the ice sculptures
all smash to the floor. You notice the Hunchback

656
00:41:55,518 --> 00:42:00,486
of Notre Dame, this kindly old man, has fallen to
the floor. He's writhing in pain.

657
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:05,058
AMY: Is he smaller than the average person?

658
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:14,399
SAM: He is. He's small. I'm sorry about the music.
He's foaming at the mouth, convulsing, he seems to

659
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,525
be having some sort of medical attention.

660
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:19,366
AMY: I go up to him and shake him.

661
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:22,776
SAM: Shake him? Okay, it does nothing. He is still
convulsing violently.

662
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:26,857
AMY: I slap him. Wake up! You might have been a
good suitor.

663
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:31,531
SAM: That does not seem to help him at all. He's
definitely having a heart attack.

664
00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:39,129
YURI: Can we try a medicine check on him? CPR? I
would love to CPR him.

665
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:43,832
SAM: Are you proficient in medicine?

666
00:42:43,832 --> 00:42:46,078
YURI: No! But I'm crazy, so--

667
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:47,657
(laughter)

668
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:51,004
STEFANIE: I step up and say: Hey, I'm not a
healer, but do we have one here?

669
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:55,381
H MICHAEL: The Mad Hatter is like somebody who stayed at
a Holiday Inn last night.

670
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:57,834
(laughter)

671
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:02,923
NOELLE: I've been told that my songs are very
soothing, so I would love to use my Healing Word

672
00:43:02,923 --> 00:43:05,324
on this convulsing man.

673
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:07,120
SAM: Oh, what would you like to say to him
to--

674
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,725
AMY: I hold him to my bosom as he listens.

675
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:13,530
NOELLE: And I come in and I join the embrace, I'm
like: Hey buddy, hang in there, it's all going to

676
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:21,079
be okay. (singing) Here's my song for you, a
little dying man, it's going to be okay. Just

677
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,409
improvising here, you know.

678
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:28,533
SAM: Yeah, no, that's great! The Hunchback of
Notre Dame sort of comes to again suddenly,

679
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:35,648
hearing the sweet, kindly music of Peter Pan and
feeling the warmth of a bosom pressed against his face.

680
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:37,731
NOELLE: Make that two bosoms.

681
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:45,126
SAM: He starts babbling to you in French, he
speaks no English. But it seems that he is very

682
00:43:45,126 --> 00:43:47,875
grateful and now very much alive again.

683
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,923
NOELLE: Yeah, you know what, it would have been
great if someone hadn't talked me out of my

684
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,624
Comprehend Languages spell, I really could have
had something here.

685
00:43:53,624 --> 00:43:58,009
STEFANIE: Je parle français, en fait, et ça suffit
que--

686
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:17,246
SAM: (French accent) "Oh, shit. Oů est l'autobus?
Dans la rue de Victor Hugo?" He seems like he's in

687
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:21,797
frail health, he can't talk very much. He kind of
passes out. It seems like you should leave him

688
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:23,101
alone for a second.

689
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:28,577
H MICHAEL: Until a plan is organized, I lay under
him, to give him a soft place to rest.

690
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:31,596
NOELLE: I think that we all want to seduce this
Hunchback.

691
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:34,862
MOLLY: I come over and tap Peter on the shoulder.

692
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:42,451
NOELLE: Hey, I'm healing a gravely injured man.
Did you see me do that? I did that. It was really hot.

693
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:47,073
MOLLY: We know how to deal with pirates. Can we
maybe deal with this situation, because we both

694
00:44:47,073 --> 00:44:50,860
want to have a nice cruise, and then we can go
back to ignoring each other on this very nice cruise.

695
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,249
AMY: Peter, I'd like to say, I might be the Queen
of Hearts, but you might be the king. You saved

696
00:44:57,249 --> 00:45:02,470
him from his heart attack, you see. You see? Do
you see what I said?

697
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:08,907
NOELLE: I do. I see what you're laying down there,
and I like it. You know, I love a funny woman.

698
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:12,539
MOLLY: If you want a tiny man, he's literally a
child. Always.

699
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:15,018
NOELLE: That's untrue. I'm uncomfortable with that
implication.

700
00:45:15,018 --> 00:45:23,100
SAM: H, make a perception check. Roll a d20.

701
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:31,291
H MICHAEL: Okay. Perception. 12 plus two, 14.

702
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:39,424
SAM: Out of the side of your eye, in the melee,
through the hole in the hull that was caused by

703
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:46,824
the cannon fire, you see the edge of a pirate ship
through some cannon smoke out there.

704
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:51,049
H MICHAEL: I go: Oh, fuck! And I let the hunchback
drop on the floor and I go over to look.

705
00:45:51,049 --> 00:46:00,589
SAM: Peering out the hole in the wall, you can see
a sleek black cutlass. Is that what they're

706
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:04,329
called? A sleek black pirate ship moving around.

707
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,868
NOELLE: That is not a cutlass.

708
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:10,687
SAM: A cutlass is a sword. No, a schooner! I don't
know anything about boats!

709
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,875
NOELLE: It's called The Cutlass.

710
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:19,938
H MICHAEL: Tonight Sam's going to be laying in his
bed with nightmares of boats and not knowing what

711
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:22,358
they're called, just going by.

712
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,332
SAM: I know schooner, and that's it.

713
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:26,809
YURI: The name of the ship is The Cutlass.

714
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:33,047
SAM: Sure. Okay, great. No, it's not, but okay. A
sleek black pirate ship seems to be coming about,

715
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:37,847
and you can see movement on the deck. It seems
like some cannons are being aimed towards you.

716
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:42,140
That's it. Also, Goldilocks, roll a perception
check.

717
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,275
STEFANIE: Ten.

718
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:52,001
SAM: That's enough. A bunch of ice sculptures have
broken, there's lots of water on the floor, but

719
00:46:52,001 --> 00:47:00,976
mixed with the ice, you feel warm seawater on your
feet, and realize that your ship is taking on

720
00:47:00,976 --> 00:47:02,119
water.

721
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,005
AMY: Put your hands on me, Hatter!

722
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:11,851
STEFANIE: Hey, I think that warm water is leaking
into our ship, although I'm happy to know that

723
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:14,786
we're in the Caribbean! This is not the Titanic!

724
00:47:14,786 --> 00:47:16,700
AMY: Yes, always looking for a positive edge!

725
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,182
STEFANIE: We should get some floaties and continue
the party!

726
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:22,091
YURI: So it's like going down in a jacuzzi!

727
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:23,932
H MICHAEL: They're about to shoot us again!

728
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:28,453
NOELLE: I want to go get a look at this pirate
ship. Can I do that? And roll a perception check

729
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:29,414
for that.

730
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,918
MOLLY: Yeah, I'm going to check it out, too.

731
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:32,426
NOELLE: I got a 22.

732
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:33,640
MOLLY: I got the exact same.

733
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,181
NOELLE: Hey, okay, just let me have this. Come on,
man. Come on.

734
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,924
MOLLY: Peering right over your shoulder.

735
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:44,940
SAM: It's an imposing pirate vessel with black
sails, dark wood, sleek and sturdy with rails made

736
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,521
of human bone.

737
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:47,759
NOELLE: What the fuck!

738
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:53,774
SAM: It's got a dozen brass cannons ringing the
hull and below decks. Emblazoned on the bow are

739
00:47:53,774 --> 00:48:00,004
the words, "The Jolly Roger." Peter and Wendy, you
both recognize this ship instantly as belonging to

740
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,333
Captain Hook.

741
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,628
NOELLE: My other ex!

742
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:06,020
H MICHAEL: He does not sound very jolly to me.

743
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,436
NOELLE: You know, he's not, actually.

744
00:48:08,436 --> 00:48:11,148
MOLLY: Yeah, what happened with you two? I don't
want to know.

745
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:13,117
SAM: Wendy, what did you roll for perception?

746
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:14,130
MOLLY: I got 22 also.

747
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,964
SAM: Okay, so Wendy, through the smoke and the
chaos, you notice that the pirates running around

748
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:24,825
on the other vessel are much smaller than you
expected. You recognize them as Tootles, Slightly,

749
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:32,932
Nibs, Curly, and the Twins. It is the Lost Boys,
and they are preparing to shoot again. What would

750
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:34,319
you like to do?

751
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,835
MOLLY: This is yours. Those are yours.

752
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:40,672
NOELLE: Oh my God, oh! My friends! Do they like
me? I don't remember. I should go talk to them.

753
00:48:40,672 --> 00:48:44,064
MOLLY: No, you probably abandoned them in a
Chili's or something.

754
00:48:44,064 --> 00:48:48,375
NOELLE: They still want to be my friends. I'm
going to go talk to them. Okay. How do I get over

755
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,065
there? Flying. Totally.

756
00:48:51,065 --> 00:48:55,479
SAM: The hole that the cannon made is about yea
big.

757
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:58,373
NOELLE: I'm a little larger than that. Not a lot
larger, but--

758
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:00,748
SAM: Sure. Would you like to try to squeeze
through the hole?

759
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:03,465
NOELLE: Maybe I'll-- hmm.

760
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:13,260
SAM: You hear more screams of pain now coming from
above and people running on deck. You can hear

761
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,953
things rolling above you.

762
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,039
NOELLE: I'm going to go up there, maybe, where
that stuff is.

763
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,478
YURI: We should all go up there!

764
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:22,072
NOELLE: Hey, let's go up where the water is not!

765
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:27,297
AMY: And before we do anything to your friends,
are they all very small?

766
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,786
NOELLE: They're very small.

767
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:29,937
AMY: Oh, my heart.

768
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:31,260
MOLLY: They're literally children.

769
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,629
NOELLE: We don't know how the Neverland magic is
working. They might be children. I am not a child,

770
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:36,755
I myself. I just want to make that super clear.

771
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:40,042
H MICHAEL: I shift in next to the Mad Hatter, and
I go: Let's get up there! And also, while we go,

772
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:43,589
do you love anyone and are you open to loving
someone new?

773
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:47,154
MOLLY: And while we go up the stairs: Tell me more
about your fetishes. Because you've got some

774
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,877
really interesting things.

775
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:50,706
AMY: I like being the mommy.

776
00:49:50,706 --> 00:49:59,051
STEFANIE: Are there other instruments, like a
scepter?

777
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:01,249
AMY: I have a whip! I have a whip!

778
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,748
MOLLY: I have a whip.

779
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:04,151
AMY: Oh, do you?

780
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:08,380
MOLLY: A magical whip, yeah. Listen, don't get
into a relationship where they want you to be

781
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,965
their mom. That is my advice to you.

782
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:17,195
NOELLE: I would like to be in a relationship with
someone who wants to be my mom. I'm going to go

783
00:50:17,195 --> 00:50:19,843
and talk to these pirates, but also, call me.

784
00:50:19,843 --> 00:50:22,084
AMY: Yes, I'm not going anywhere.

785
00:50:22,084 --> 00:50:28,445
SAM: Peter Pan dashes in his slight way across the
dance hall to the door.

786
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:30,159
YURI: Are there stairs?

787
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,526
SAM: There's a doorway that the Beast disappeared
through to go up to the deck. You try the door.

788
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:37,257
The door is locked.

789
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:39,517
YURI: That son of a bitch!

790
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:44,808
AMY: Not on my watch! And I'm going to scepter my
way through the door.

791
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,395
SAM: Okay. Roll for an attack.

792
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:54,344
AMY: I think it's time to rage. So yeah, that's
the last of it. Nothing stands between me and at

793
00:50:54,344 --> 00:51:03,335
least ten tiny men! I get advantage if I'm
raging.

794
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:10,404
SAM: Yeah. You used your bonus action to rage, now
you're raging and you get advantage, I believe, on

795
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,416
strength-based. Yeah.

796
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:15,305
AMY: Okay, so that's even better. How about a 16?

797
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:18,610
SAM: Sure. You definitely hit the door. Roll for
damage.

798
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,361
AMY: Okay, solid eight on an eight, so that's 13.

799
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:31,046
SAM: Okay. The door splinters open and is knocked
clean off of its hinges. You all see the queen

800
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:38,219
exhibit a ferocious amount of anger towards this
door, and it explodes into splinters. The path is

801
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,418
clear. You may climb the stairs to the deck.

802
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:43,500
H MICHAEL: I am as rock hard as a man with no
blood can be.

803
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:50,914
AMY: I stand there going: Yes, go! If I can let
them go before me, I just want to relish in my glory.

804
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:54,090
YURI: And you said I was mad.

805
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:59,514
NOELLE: We're coming back to this. I'm going up
there now, but we're coming back to this.

806
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:03,799
H MICHAEL: As I pass the Queen of Hearts, I give
her a little back of the fingers brush on her hip.

807
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:06,741
Just a little flirty nothing.

808
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:12,510
AMY: I'm sorry, I'm raging. I will elbow that.

809
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,577
SAM: Okay. Roll for an attack.

810
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:18,847
AMY: I'm raging, I can't-- I'm in a frenzy.

811
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:20,324
H MICHAEL: You can't control yourself.

812
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:24,727
AMY: Oh, well. That's advantage, so how's a-- oh,
even worse. A nine.

813
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:31,112
SAM: That does not hit. She tries to elbow you,
but you, having no bones, just noodle your way away.

814
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:35,457
H MICHAEL: I totally take it as a sign. I go
(goofy giggle) and I keep going.

815
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:41,646
YURI: I run out the door, but right through her
legs, right under her skirt because I am a wee man.

816
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:45,006
SAM: Sure. Make an acrobatics check.

817
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:49,688
YURI: An acrobatics check? 18 plus three, 21.

818
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:55,574
SAM: You do a risky business slide right between
her legs.

819
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:58,287
YURI: Looking up as I go through.

820
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,926
SAM: Does he see anything?

821
00:53:00,926 --> 00:53:02,767
YURI: Do I have to roll for that?

822
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:06,257
SAM: I don't know what she's wearing under there.

823
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:08,276
AMY: I didn't think about this.

824
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:09,799
SAM: Are you wearing bloomers?

825
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,629
AMY: I am not. I'm wearing nothing. I'm wearing
absolutely nothing.

826
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:16,115
SAM: All right. So you see what you see.

827
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:18,849
YURI: I see what I see. That's my secret, y'all!

828
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:22,622
SAM: All right. Are you going to head up the
stairs, Yuri?

829
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:23,713
YURI: Yes.

830
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:25,034
SAM: Okay, who else is going?

831
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,408
(sounds of agreement from all)

832
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:29,389
SAM: All right, let's get this out.

833
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:32,425
ALL: Oh!

834
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:35,945
H MICHAEL: What's happening? I don't know this
game!

835
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:43,028
SAM: Neither do I! This is a crudely drawn map
that I drew because I'm a crude drawer.

836
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:47,932
NOELLE: I feel like I was there. Like, the
atmosphere is really good. You did a really good

837
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:48,984
job on this map.

838
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:50,250
SAM: Okay, Mad Hatter's first.

839
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,781
H MICHAEL: I love these long blue birds.

840
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:57,889
SAM: You guys are coming up this hatch in the
middle. Mad Hatter will be first. Who's next?

841
00:53:57,889 --> 00:53:59,673
NOELLE: Me!

842
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:01,800
SAM: Peter Pan is next.

843
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,325
NOELLE: Oh, I'm so cute!

844
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:12,917
SAM: We'll say Wendy is close behind. The Queen is
still downstairs, right, letting them all go? And

845
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:21,910
then we'll say Scarecrow. This is Goldilocks, come
out behind, and you guys are looking, and you've

846
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:28,796
seen already, you know it's there. This is the
pirate vessel coming around for another attack.

847
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:31,604
STEFANIE: Those are the Lost Boys. Your men.

848
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:34,617
YURI: They're tiny. They're so tiny.

849
00:54:34,617 --> 00:54:45,220
SAM: They are getting ready for another cannon
shot. Okay, everybody. Shit, shit, shit! This is

850
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:54,923
the hard part! Okay, roll for initiative,
everybody! Roll a d20. Add your initiative to it.

851
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:59,659
I'll roll for the boys. Okay, okay.

852
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:01,098
H MICHAEL: I have a 16.

853
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,883
NOELLE: I am an eight.

854
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:08,404
SAM: Okay, hold on. Yup, 16. Eight. Yes, keep
going. Wendy.

855
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:09,815
MOLLY: Four.

856
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,600
STEFANIE: I'm an 11.

857
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,619
AMY: I am a four.

858
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:20,154
YURI: I am also a four. I thought I was certainly
going to be the lowest, but no.

859
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:23,179
NOELLE: Good job, everybody.

860
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:30,941
SAM: Okay. Oh my God, why do I always do this to
myself? I have 12 people to keep track of! Okay,

861
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:35,982
here we go. So who goes first?

862
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:37,876
H MICHAEL: It would be me, right?

863
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,547
SAM: Yes, but you were last to come up the
staircase. You will get to go this round, but

864
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:46,175
because you've never played D&amp;D before, I'm going
to let someone else go first.

865
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,333
H MICHAEL: Oh, come on, I've got a great opening
move!

866
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,267
SAM: All right, great! Then you know what? Go for
it! If you want to do it.

867
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:54,785
H MICHAEL: So how far is it to the edge of this
ship?

868
00:55:54,785 --> 00:56:02,979
SAM: These squares are all five feet, so you are
standing about 30 feet from the edge.

869
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:06,249
H MICHAEL: Okay. I move right to the edge of the
boat.

870
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:10,339
SAM: He's super fast when he moves, because he's
got these noodle legs.

871
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:15,938
H MICHAEL: Okay. And the first thing I do is I
menace this motherfucker right at the edge over

872
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:17,392
here, across the water.

873
00:56:17,392 --> 00:56:22,966
SAM: You're going to use your menacing action to
try and intimidate?

874
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:26,225
H MICHAEL: I want to send some fear out there
before this shit gets started.

875
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:31,534
SAM: Okay. Shit, I don't know how menace works.
Hold on. Let me look. Where's your fucking

876
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:33,229
character sheet?

877
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:34,777
MOLLY: Isn't it intimidation?

878
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:38,470
SAM: He's got to roll for it, for sure, so roll--
Wait, no, it might be--

879
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:49,367
H MICHAEL: Menacing. Instead of attacking, you can
scare one creature, intimidate versus insight.

880
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:55,879
SAM: Oh, so it's intimidate versus insight. Yes,
you're right. So roll your d20, add plus five I think.

881
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,312
H MICHAEL: So I get 25.

882
00:56:57,312 --> 00:57:08,211
SAM: Oh, shit, he's done. He rolled a one, so he
is scared of you and on his turn he will probably

883
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:09,614
run away from you.

884
00:57:09,614 --> 00:57:13,842
H MICHAEL: Okay. And to be out of the cannon
blast, I'll move two--

885
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:16,957
SAM: I'm going to put this on him, so we know that
he is now intimidated.

886
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:25,506
H MICHAEL: And then, to be not totally in the
blast radius, I'll move back ten feet, so two spaces.

887
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:32,747
SAM: That was a good first-ever attack! Good job,
H!

888
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:34,803
H MICHAEL: Hey, thanks for the claps, you guys.

889
00:57:34,803 --> 00:57:36,269
NOELLE: Good scarecrow, man.

890
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:45,646
H MICHAEL: Oh! I forgot one thing. I can un-sew a
part of my head when I menace to show the molding

891
00:57:45,646 --> 00:57:52,581
hay inside of my skull. And then I quickly stitch
it up and put my branded hat back on.

892
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:59,833
SAM: Great. So yes, Tootles is scared out of his
mind. He's shaking in his boots. And he's a little

893
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:05,253
kid, too, so you just scared the shit out of a
little kid by showing him your monstrous moist

894
00:58:05,253 --> 00:58:06,216
insides.

895
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,158
H MICHAEL: Don't try to make me feel bad about
this! I love it!

896
00:58:08,158 --> 00:58:10,045
AMY: That was my strategy later!

897
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:17,103
(laughter)

898
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:23,870
SAM: By the way, Scarecrow is a monk, for those of
you who care. Nibs is going to make an attack.

899
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:32,151
He's going to use a sling and try to hit the
closest. Nibs is this one, by the way. He's trying

900
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:37,797
to hit the closest person to him, which is
Scarecrow. He rolled a 13. What's your AC? What's

901
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:39,384
your armor class?

902
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:40,356
H MICHAEL: 13.

903
00:58:40,356 --> 00:58:41,402
SAM: That hits, right?

904
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:42,443
AMY: Yeah, baby.

905
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:48,194
SAM: Okay, thank you. I don't know nothing. He
hits you with three points of damage!

906
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:50,562
YURI: Take it!

907
00:58:50,562 --> 00:58:52,844
H MICHAEL: Do I write this down?

908
00:58:52,844 --> 00:58:58,910
SAM: Yes. So you have a hit point maximum there.
Noelle, show him his hit points.

909
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:04,030
NOELLE: Your hit points are here. You have 23.

910
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:12,264
SAM: So subtract three. Slightly is going to go
next! He is this one right here. He's going to

911
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:23,696
sling at you as well. You know what, he's just out
of range of you, so he can't. He's going to move

912
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:27,384
closer. He's going to move up here, and that's the
end of his turn. He's not going to attack.

913
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:28,939
Goldilocks, you're up!

914
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:34,823
STEFANIE: So the farthest I can move to get close
to them is-- So I'll use my movement and get as

915
00:59:34,823 --> 00:59:36,554
close to them as possible.

916
00:59:36,554 --> 00:59:41,602
SAM: You can get right up to the edge of the
ship.

917
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:48,046
STEFANIE: So my Thunderwave is only in a 15-foot
cube, but they're not in it.

918
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,324
SAM: You would not be able to hit any of them with
Thunderwave.

919
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:57,857
STEFANIE: Now that I'm here facing them--

920
00:59:57,857 --> 01:00:01,327
AMY: I feel like Thunderwave has a range.

921
01:00:01,327 --> 01:00:03,571
SAM: It's 15 feet from self.

922
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:06,540
STEFANIE: So it's not going to get them.

923
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:11,100
H MICHAEL: Does it have to land on the square, or
is it the distance in between? Because if you went

924
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,383
diagonally you could go--

925
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:13,656
SAM: It would not do it!

926
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:16,614
H MICHAEL: Okay. I don't know anything; I'm just
asking.

927
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:19,906
STEFANIE: No, Scarecrow.

928
01:00:19,906 --> 01:00:26,275
SAM: Do you have anything? If you cannot strike or
use your action to attack, you can also hold your

929
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:30,965
action, and say, "I hold my action until they are
in range."

930
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:34,169
STEFANIE: Yeah, I'm going to hold my action.

931
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:38,372
SAM: Okay, so you're going to attack them when
they get closer. All right, great. That ends your

932
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:50,051
turn. Next up is Tootles! So he is crying. Tears
are streaming down Tootles' face. He turns and

933
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:54,875
runs, runs in fear trying to get as far away from
you as possible. He's freaked out.

934
01:00:54,916 --> 01:01:02,276
MOLLY: To clarify, are they kids? Are they
children? Because we're adults.

935
01:01:02,346 --> 01:01:04,192
SAM: They're the Lost Boys, straight from
Neverland.

936
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:05,848
NOELLE: We're definitely adults, though, right?

937
01:01:05,848 --> 01:01:07,475
MOLLY: Peter Pan is definitely over 18 years old?

938
01:01:07,475 --> 01:01:08,842
SAM: For sure, yes.

939
01:01:08,842 --> 01:01:10,161
MOLLY: But the Lost Boys are children.

940
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:18,114
SAM: These are children. They are 11 and 12 years
old. Actually, it's going to be Peter's turn next,

941
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:25,294
so you notice something about the boys. Something
seems different about them. They were always

942
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:32,941
rough-and-tumble kids, but now they seem deranged.
Filthy dirty. Wild hair and eyes with ripped

943
01:01:32,941 --> 01:01:36,519
clothing, no shoes to speak of. Some of them are
missing teeth.

944
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:45,808
NOELLE: Okay. So where's the closest area that I
can get to that has some barrels, a stack of

945
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:48,764
barrels, anything that I can go behind but be
fairly close?

946
01:01:48,764 --> 01:01:52,921
SAM: Let me paint a picture for you. Actually,
roll a perception check, because you just came out

947
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,361
on this.

948
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:56,360
NOELLE: Not great, 11.

949
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:02,961
SAM: That's okay, you're right next to stuff.
These are masts. This is the place on the ship

950
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:04,468
where you steer.

951
01:02:04,468 --> 01:02:06,052
(laughter)

952
01:02:06,052 --> 01:02:07,392
SAM: The helm?

953
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:11,994
YURI: Helm makes sense. We'll call it a helm and
get torn apart by boat enthusiasts.

954
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:18,206
SAM: It's a raised platform. There are some
lockers over here, boxes and crates over here. You

955
01:02:18,206 --> 01:02:29,985
also seem to notice there are two ballistae that
can fire things, and there are two cannons over here.

956
01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:32,158
NOELLE: So how far away am I from this ballista?

957
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:39,285
SAM: You are, it looks like, 35-ish feet from this
one, and maybe a little less to that one. 30 feet,

958
01:02:39,285 --> 01:02:40,389
maybe.

959
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,096
NOELLE: So what's this red thing here?

960
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:50,344
SAM: That, you notice, is a gangplank. That's what
they use to load and unload the ship at port. It's

961
01:02:50,344 --> 01:02:56,634
a long ladder, very long, and it unfolds to about
15 feet long.

962
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:58,622
NOELLE: I don't see much of a use for that.

963
01:02:58,622 --> 01:03:04,847
YURI: You don't usually get to the gangplank until
later in the night. Oh, that's right, I'm sorry,

964
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,223
that was something totally different. Sorry.

965
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:09,496
AMY: Oh, my.

966
01:03:09,496 --> 01:03:15,183
H MICHAEL: Your enjoyment of that joke was as
good, if not better than, the joke.

967
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:29,559
NOELLE: Okay, I will let those two do their thing.
Can I make it to this mast nearby the ballista?

968
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:32,620
SAM: Yeah, you can swing around to here.

969
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,413
NOELLE: I'm going to go over there and kind of
hide behind it, and I'm going to shoot a Message

970
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:37,767
cantrip at the closest boy.

971
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:43,591
SAM: Okay. That, I believe, is Slightly. Yes,
Slightly.

972
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:49,946
NOELLE: Okay, so I shoot a Message cantrip. I'm
like: Yo, dude. What the fuck? Like, shrug emoji,

973
01:03:49,946 --> 01:03:58,811
fire emoji, explosion emoji, skull and crossbones
emoji. It's me, Peter, by the way.

974
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:05,551
SAM: So he hears, in his ears, magically, Peter's
voice saying to him, "what gives, what's going

975
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:16,204
"on?" And he replies to you, because he can do that
with Message, right? Yeah. Not Massage. He replies

976
01:04:16,204 --> 01:04:26,618
by saying-- You hear in your ear, "If we can't
have Wendy, no one can!"

977
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:28,407
NOELLE: Oh, fuck!

978
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:32,460
SAM: All right. Anything else you'd like to do for
your turn?

979
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,420
NOELLE: Can I do anything else for my turn?

980
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,315
SAM: I don't know. Bonus action or something?

981
01:04:37,315 --> 01:04:38,886
MOLLY: I think you can say something.

982
01:04:38,886 --> 01:04:40,620
NOELLE: I did with my Message.

983
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:47,785
SAM: All right. Well, that's your turn. It'll go
to twin number two, who doesn't have a name. He's

984
01:04:47,785 --> 01:04:59,372
going to roll very well and do his sling at you,
Goldilocks. This is a-- ooh, it's a 20. It

985
01:04:59,372 --> 01:05:07,152
definitely hits. And it hits with five points of
damage. Sorry, lady.

986
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:11,467
STEFANIE: I guess we can't use our Shield again.

987
01:05:11,467 --> 01:05:14,130
SAM: Sure, you can use Shield. As a reaction,
right?

988
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:14,847
STEFANIE: Yeah!

989
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:17,144
SAM: Is it once per-- What's it say?

990
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:22,551
STEFANIE: Oh, wait, I'm not going to use my
Shield, because then I can't use my Thunderwave,

991
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,627
right? I can only use three per day, and I don't
know how long this night is going to go, so I will

992
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:29,628
take damage so I can kill them later.

993
01:05:29,628 --> 01:05:31,397
MOLLY: Are you saying all this in character?

994
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:34,048
STEFANIE: That's what I'm doing.

995
01:05:34,048 --> 01:05:35,993
SAM: Mark five points off your health.

996
01:05:35,993 --> 01:05:38,474
YURI: I thought I was crazy. What is she talking
about?

997
01:05:38,474 --> 01:05:46,311
SAM: Twin number two is going to run down to this
cannon and continue to load it. That brings us

998
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:52,922
to-- Peter went already, right? So now it's all
the fours. Wendy, Queen, and the Hatter. Who wants

999
01:05:52,922 --> 01:05:54,498
to go first?

1000
01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:55,724
YURI: Sure.

1001
01:05:55,724 --> 01:05:57,558
MOLLY: What?

1002
01:05:57,558 --> 01:06:06,501
SAM: Let's move this along. The ship has now come
closer and moved around to here. They're preparing

1003
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:07,790
to fire.

1004
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,227
STEFANIE: Does Goldilocks get her prepared
action?

1005
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:19,547
SAM: Yes! Yes, they are now within range. Thank
you, fellow DM. Go ahead and do your attack. What

1006
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:20,561
was your attack?

1007
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,203
STEFANIE: It was the Thunderwave.

1008
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:23,776
SAM: And who would you like to target?

1009
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:25,323
STEFANIE: Them.

1010
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:28,663
SAM: So you can probably hit both of these
fellows.

1011
01:06:28,663 --> 01:06:31,798
STEFANIE: I mean, 15 feet. Where is that guy?

1012
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:34,686
SAM: It's a 15-foot cube, so--

1013
01:06:34,686 --> 01:06:38,594
STEFANIE: What about this back one here? Starting
from there?

1014
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,853
I mean, I feel bad.

1015
01:06:41,853 --> 01:06:43,963
SAM: Don't feel bad. They're children.

1016
01:06:43,963 --> 01:06:46,059
STEFANIE: Can I try talking to them first?

1017
01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:49,058
SAM: No, you can't talk to them because you were
holding your action. This is all you can do.

1018
01:06:49,058 --> 01:06:51,325
STEFANIE: All right. I'll Thunderwave.

1019
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:59,501
SAM: Out of Goldilocks, she opens her mouth and a
loud, thunderous sound cracks out of her mouth,

1020
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:05,015
making a blast of thunder that hurts everybody's
ears.

1021
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:09,643
STEFANIE: What the fuck are you doing, you're
destroying our love boat cruise!

1022
01:07:09,643 --> 01:07:21,253
SAM: It's piercing, and they roll. Fail. One of
them succeeds, one of them fails. Thunderwave is

1023
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,360
what, 2d8? Is that right?

1024
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,474
STEFANIE: Yeah, 2d8.

1025
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:35,964
SAM: So roll 2d8. Do that. Roll it again. You're
going to add these together.

1026
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,159
STEFANIE: Two.

1027
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:39,153
SAM: Okay, so that's four points of damage.

1028
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:44,665
STEFANIE: I'm going to use my Lucky and re-roll. I
get lucky three times per day.

1029
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:46,808
SAM: Sure. You can re-roll one of those.

1030
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:51,958
STEFANIE: Two again!

1031
01:07:51,958 --> 01:08:00,007
SAM: So they both take four points of damage and
this one is sent ten feet back. All right,

1032
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:08,346
excellent job. Let me mark off their damage. Okay,
next is Curly. Right, he's the one who hasn't

1033
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:09,767
gone? Have they all?

1034
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,514
STEFANIE: Curly hasn't.

1035
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:17,232
SAM: He's this one, right? Shit. I can't remember,
they all look alike! He's going to roll and attack

1036
01:08:17,232 --> 01:08:20,392
you, Goldilocks, because you just attacked one of
his friends.

1037
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:23,773
H MICHAEL: You should have given them-- it's like
anime rules. Everybody needs a different color hair.

1038
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:26,440
SAM: I didn't make these god damn minis!

1039
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,858
H MICHAEL: They're all basically drawn the same,
so someone's got half a face.

1040
01:08:29,858 --> 01:08:31,945
SAM: He's just rolled a 19, he hits you.

1041
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:33,754
STEFANIE: Yeah, I use my Shield now.

1042
01:08:33,754 --> 01:08:44,146
SAM: You do. That's plus five to AC, right? So he
does not hit. He slings a rock at you. It barely

1043
01:08:44,146 --> 01:08:50,420
misses you and clatters across the deck of the
ship. You are fine. Queen of Hearts and Hatter

1044
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:57,619
have to go. Have you gone yet? How did I skip
Wendy? Oh, okay.

1045
01:08:57,619 --> 01:09:00,269
NOELLE: They're all equally shitty at rolling.

1046
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,726
YURI: Thank you. Thank you.

1047
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:04,428
NOELLE: You're welcome.

1048
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:12,105
AMY: It sounds like there's so much happening up
there! I run up the stairs, look around and see

1049
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:20,157
where all the action is. If I can get to at least
the edge of the boat, I'm at 30-foot speed.

1050
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:25,667
SAM: You took ten feet to get up there, so you can
get right about there.

1051
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:34,828
AMY: Okay, awesome. I yell at them: Mommy's home!

1052
01:09:34,828 --> 01:09:46,058
SAM: As soon as you say "Mommy's home," the
closest one to you, Nibs, smiles, and says,

1053
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:47,771
"Mommy?"

1054
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:51,868
STEFANIE: Goldilocks mutters: This is fucked up.

1055
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:53,925
NOELLE: This is fucked up!

1056
01:09:53,925 --> 01:10:01,116
SAM: As you're all on deck now, you notice the
chaos and carnage around you. Your vessel is not

1057
01:10:01,116 --> 01:10:07,936
designed for fighting and has suffered badly. Two
of its three masts are broken. The deck is riddled

1058
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:11,205
with holes. It's on fire in one place.

1059
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:13,414
NOELLE: Am I in the fire?

1060
01:10:13,414 --> 01:10:25,847
SAM: I will draw you fire. Where is it? Ah!
Where's my pens? Fuck it. This is on fire over

1061
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:29,937
here. This is fire. This mast is gone. This mast
is damaged.

1062
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:35,056
NOELLE: Just really immerse us in the situation.

1063
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:38,232
ALL: Oh, wow!

1064
01:10:38,232 --> 01:10:40,567
H MICHAEL: The water's on fire!

1065
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:45,416
STEFANIE: Is Scarecrow freaking out now, because
fire?

1066
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:51,828
SAM: Most of the crew is injured or dead. There's
a dead guy over here. There's a dead guy over

1067
01:10:51,828 --> 01:10:54,567
here. There's a dead guy right here.

1068
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:58,879
STEFANIE: All the knives and forks from Beauty and
the Beast--

1069
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:01,365
NOELLE: Are Beauty and the Beast alive?

1070
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,651
SAM: You don't see-- Actually, roll a perception
check.

1071
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:08,764
NOELLE: I want to look for the Beast! I got a one,
I don't see him!

1072
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,164
SAM: Okay, anyone else want to take a look?

1073
01:11:10,164 --> 01:11:12,001
H MICHAEL: You blink while you look.

1074
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:19,186
SAM: And you got another two. Awesome. Okay, you
guys look around for the Beast, anywhere in sight.

1075
01:11:19,186 --> 01:11:20,723
You do not see the Beast.

1076
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:24,019
NOELLE: I did forget to open my eyes.

1077
01:11:24,019 --> 01:11:28,765
SAM: You, Goldilocks, do notice that there's a
lifeboat right here, but it has been severely

1078
01:11:28,765 --> 01:11:37,333
damaged in the attack. There is no lifeboat right
there. Some of the crew had light weapons. They're

1079
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:43,652
scattered around the ground. There's also these
weapon lockers over here that have different

1080
01:11:43,652 --> 01:11:48,539
things in them. Okay, top of the round.

1081
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:50,937
AMY: These two.

1082
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:55,206
SAM: Sorry, sorry, you haven't gone yet! Sorry, I
keep skipping you. Go ahead, go ahead.

1083
01:11:55,206 --> 01:11:56,846
MOLLY: Do you have something?

1084
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,340
YURI: Go, go, go.

1085
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:04,245
MOLLY: Wendy steps forward, seeing the Lost Boys
and rolling her eyes, especially at the one who

1086
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:12,019
was like "Mom!" And she's like, let me see if I
can remember how to do this. And she turns into a

1087
01:12:12,019 --> 01:12:13,701
giant eagle!

1088
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:16,769
SAM: Oh, shit. That is so cool.

1089
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:22,682
MOLLY: She spreads massive wings. She's a large
beast, which is very big. Maybe not quite as big

1090
01:12:22,682 --> 01:12:24,022
as a dragon, but--

1091
01:12:24,022 --> 01:12:26,009
AMY: I've never been less attracted to you!

1092
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,721
NOELLE: An eagle as big as a dragon?

1093
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:36,400
MOLLY: It's a big eagle, and she flaps over. She's
trying to basically grab the boy who's on the

1094
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,478
cannon and put him into the water.

1095
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:46,672
SAM: So you can fly over there. I don't think that
you can also grab. You can get over there and turn

1096
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:47,826
into--

1097
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:49,645
MOLLY: It's an action, you're right. Yeah,
totally.

1098
01:12:49,645 --> 01:12:51,804
YURI: Their reaction to this should be shitting
their pants.

1099
01:12:51,804 --> 01:13:00,098
MOLLY: I use my action to turn into a huge eagle
and hover over the boat, my wings blowing air in

1100
01:13:00,098 --> 01:13:01,748
everybody's faces.

1101
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:04,612
NOELLE: You're doing so good, Sam! This is
awesome!

1102
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:07,197
(exclamations)

1103
01:13:07,197 --> 01:13:13,234
MOLLY: I really want one of those birds that you
can balance on your finger, and I could just hold it.

1104
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:15,388
NOELLE: Oh, no, she's dead now.

1105
01:13:15,388 --> 01:13:16,715
MOLLY: I'm drowning.

1106
01:13:16,715 --> 01:13:18,565
NOELLE: She's fine again.

1107
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:28,114
SAM: You're floating above them. Probably not that
high either, but whatever. It's done. Okay, that's

1108
01:13:28,114 --> 01:13:31,245
your action and your movement. Are you good?

1109
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,202
MOLLY: That's it. That's all I got.

1110
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:41,537
YURI: I think I might be able to do it from where
I am, but if not, I might be able to get closer. I

1111
01:13:41,537 --> 01:13:50,109
would like to try to Sleep some of them. Because
that's what I do. I'm boring. I'm going to sing

1112
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:54,726
them a lullaby, and Sleep as many as I can. It's
90 feet.

1113
01:13:54,726 --> 01:14:06,310
SAM: Absolutely, sure. Yeah, go ahead and roll,
what is it, 5d8? To find out how many hit points

1114
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:10,415
of sleep you cause? Is that how it works? Shit.

1115
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:26,504
YURI: Yeah, 5d8. Total is how many hit points.
Where are my d8s at?

1116
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:31,812
SAM: Guys, by the way. Little legal note here.
Yuri is portraying a character tonight called The

1117
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:38,178
Hatter. He's not portraying a character called
anything other than The Hatter, which would be

1118
01:14:38,178 --> 01:14:39,826
property of Disney.

1119
01:14:39,826 --> 01:14:43,615
NOELLE: I wouldn't know of any other character
known as the Hatter.

1120
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:46,005
SAM: He's the crazy hat.

1121
01:14:46,256 --> 01:14:48,456
H MICHAEL: He's the goofball cap-wearer.

1122
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:52,420
SAM: Yeah. Because we're all on the S.S. Public
Domain, guys.

1123
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:59,950
YURI: 24.

1124
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:10,945
SAM: 24 points of hit points. You can pick four of
those guys to Sleep.

1125
01:15:10,945 --> 01:15:20,398
YURI: How about the four that are closest to me?

1126
01:15:20,398 --> 01:15:28,279
SAM: Where are you? You haven't moved, so that's
these four?

1127
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:31,641
YURI: The ones that are closest to me, physically.
Me, the person, who is not the Hatter, but who is

1128
01:15:31,641 --> 01:15:33,219
also the Hatter.

1129
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:35,864
SAM: So they all fall asleep. That's how sleep
works, there's no save.

1130
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,747
H MICHAEL: Fucking fantastic.

1131
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:48,951
SAM: Right? That's how that works?

1132
01:15:48,951 --> 01:15:50,617
YURI: Sure! Yeah!

1133
01:15:50,617 --> 01:15:55,670
SAM: They're all within 20 feet of each other. I
think that's how it works. I don't care. That's

1134
01:15:55,701 --> 01:16:00,126
how it works! Great! Okay, that was amazing,
Hatter. That was amazing.

1135
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:02,139
YURI: Thank you. Sometimes--

1136
01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:05,003
NOELLE: I know. I am attracted to all of you.

1137
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:08,502
YURI: I didn't even have to use Charm Person on
you!

1138
01:16:08,502 --> 01:16:17,576
SAM: Okay, you notice that four of the Lost Boys
get all sleepy-eyed and curl up into a little

1139
01:16:17,576 --> 01:16:19,885
fetal position and go to sleep. Night-night time.

1140
01:16:19,885 --> 01:16:23,113
AMY: A tiny man who is good with children!

1141
01:16:23,113 --> 01:16:31,088
SAM: Okay. That brings us to the top of the round,
right? No one is awake to fire their cannons, so

1142
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:39,267
they do not. But the one who is left, who's
actually up a bit, on lookout. He's one of the

1143
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:47,342
twins. He yells to you, Wendy, "Wendy, Mama, we
miss you! Come back to Neverland! Ever since you

1144
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:53,973
"and Peter broke up, we've nobody to take care of
us! We don't know how to cook, bathe, brush our

1145
01:16:53,973 --> 01:17:04,773
"teeth! We're getting sick! Curly has the runs!"
You also notice that above the twin, on that mast,

1146
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:15,633
is Captain Hook's severed head, stuck to the top
of the mast. A gruesome effigy of the madness that

1147
01:17:15,633 --> 01:17:29,628
has befallen the boys. The ship is still moving a
bit. It's drifting, because the guy who was

1148
01:17:29,628 --> 01:17:41,693
piloting it is now asleep. Just then, you realize
that your ship is starting to list severely to one

1149
01:17:41,693 --> 01:17:46,559
side. The waterline has shifted. One of the
injured sailors calls out, "Oh, Gods, we're

1150
01:17:46,559 --> 01:17:51,919
"sinking!" What would you like to do? We're at the
top of the round. It's Scarecrow's turn.

1151
01:17:51,919 --> 01:17:57,110
STEFANIE: Remember when you said you were super
absorbent?

1152
01:17:57,110 --> 01:18:06,719
H MICHAEL: That's a good point. I think we've got
to take this fucking ship. Most of them are either

1153
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,155
scared or sleeping, right?

1154
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:09,789
SAM: Yeah.

1155
01:18:09,789 --> 01:18:17,632
H MICHAEL: Okay, I have an action, an attack, and
40 feet of movement, right?

1156
01:18:17,632 --> 01:18:27,072
SAM: Correct. You can jump. You can use your
action not just to attack, but you can do things,

1157
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:28,765
use objects.

1158
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:35,577
H MICHAEL: Okay. So this is 15 feet, this ladder?

1159
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,250
SAM: Yes.

1160
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:47,370
H MICHAEL: So I'm going to hit this ladder, shove
it straight out, and try to get it to briefly dock

1161
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:48,837
onto the other ship.

1162
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:51,042
SAM: Okay. Roll a strength check.

1163
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:54,199
H MICHAEL: Let's see. 16 plus two, 18.

1164
01:18:54,199 --> 01:19:02,900
SAM: Fuck yeah. You knock it, and it goes
(clatter). It's stretching, it's skidding across

1165
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:10,143
their deck, because their ship is still moving a
little bit in relation to yours, but there is a

1166
01:19:10,143 --> 01:19:12,638
temporary bridge there that you can use.

1167
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:15,515
AMY: You are two for two for applause on your D&amp;D
turns.

1168
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:23,839
H MICHAEL: Okay, and so I want to get this guy out
of commission, so I use my movement to move right

1169
01:19:23,839 --> 01:19:29,236
to the ledge of their ship. I cross the bridge and
I land right on the bridge of their ship, and I

1170
01:19:29,236 --> 01:19:31,456
look up at the man at the top.

1171
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:33,177
SAM: He's a boy. He's a tiny child.

1172
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:37,228
H MICHAEL: The boy in the crow's nest. And I stick
my fingers in my mesh face and I pull it sideways

1173
01:19:37,228 --> 01:19:43,136
and I scream up at him, and I use my menace again
on him.

1174
01:19:43,136 --> 01:19:48,066
SAM: Okay. Great. That is an action. You roll
versus insight.

1175
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:49,900
H MICHAEL: 12 plus five, 17.

1176
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:58,177
SAM: 17. He rolls a natural 20. You try to make
him go berserk, and he looks down at you, but

1177
01:19:58,177 --> 01:20:02,190
through the cannon smoke and the chaos, he can't
even really get a good glimpse of you, so it just fails.

1178
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:06,351
MOLLY: There is a severed head on the mast, too.

1179
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:07,872
H MICHAEL: Yeah, that's a good point.

1180
01:20:07,872 --> 01:20:10,286
NOELLE: I can't feel anything anymore!

1181
01:20:10,286 --> 01:20:12,227
H MICHAEL: My scary mask face isn't worse.

1182
01:20:12,227 --> 01:20:14,211
YURI: The dude's seen some shit.

1183
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:18,777
H MICHAEL: Also, the drawing of my character is
the sweetest fucking guy you've ever seen.

1184
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:22,856
NOELLE: Oh, man, I sure wish that I was watching
this right now, so I could see that. That must be

1185
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:24,185
so great.

1186
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:31,523
H MICHAEL: Well, maybe someday you'll be able to
look it up. In order to make it harder for this

1187
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:40,135
guy to attack me, I'm going to move right up
against the pole. I'm going to move pressed up

1188
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:44,117
against it so the ability for him to shoot
something down at me is a tough angle.

1189
01:20:44,117 --> 01:20:48,521
YURI: We're still being romantic in this. You just
pressed yourself up against his pole!

1190
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:50,319
H MICHAEL: I'll fuck anything, man.

1191
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:56,228
SAM: I don't have another platform, but-- Oh,
Jesus. Oh, forget it. Just imagine he's up a bit.

1192
01:20:56,228 --> 01:21:02,546
NOELLE: Oh, wait!

1193
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:06,873
SAM: Look at that! What on Earth?

1194
01:21:06,873 --> 01:21:09,737
NOELLE: Is that high enough?

1195
01:21:09,737 --> 01:21:17,982
SAM: Yes, ma'am. Okay, that's your turn,
Scarecrow. Next is Goldilocks.

1196
01:21:17,982 --> 01:21:25,867
STEFANIE: I am so impressed by a guy who takes
charge even though he has no idea what he's doing

1197
01:21:25,867 --> 01:21:32,163
and ends up being really, really sweet to the rest
of us, so we're going to go in. We're going to

1198
01:21:32,163 --> 01:21:34,685
move as close as we can to--

1199
01:21:34,685 --> 01:21:36,548
SAM: The bridge?

1200
01:21:36,548 --> 01:21:44,258
STEFANIE: Yeah. I assume I don't have my weapons
on me, I wasn't carrying them in the bar?

1201
01:21:44,258 --> 01:21:46,066
SAM: No.

1202
01:21:46,066 --> 01:21:49,340
STEFANIE: I'm going to use my bonus action to
summon my crossbow.

1203
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:55,628
SAM: Okay, great. So out of nowhere, a crossbow
appears in Goldilocks' hand.

1204
01:21:55,628 --> 01:21:59,101
STEFANIE: Woo! Got my crossbow. Going to aim it up
at the--

1205
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:01,127
H MICHAEL: Child?

1206
01:22:01,127 --> 01:22:07,122
STEFANIE: We're not aiming to kill, we're just
aiming to--

1207
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,683
SAM: As you aim, you notice that this one also has
glasses.

1208
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:11,665
YURI: Oh, no!

1209
01:22:11,665 --> 01:22:15,136
H MICHAEL: Kill him. Kill him. He'll never see it
coming.

1210
01:22:15,136 --> 01:22:17,265
SAM: Little parted hair, right in the middle.

1211
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:22,627
STEFANIE: But I won't kill him with my crossbow,
because my damage is--

1212
01:22:22,627 --> 01:22:25,479
SAM: Let's find out. Shoot away.

1213
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:29,616
STEFANIE: Cool. So I'm going to take this one.

1214
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:33,273
SAM: Roll a d20, add your attack bonus.

1215
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:36,686
STEFANIE: Okay, so it's a 19. Plus four.

1216
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:39,572
SAM: Great. So roll for damage. That definitely
hits.

1217
01:22:39,572 --> 01:22:47,659
STEFANIE: Well, it'll probably be a two again, so
we'll see. It's a two! I think this one's

1218
01:22:47,659 --> 01:22:49,724
screwed.

1219
01:22:49,724 --> 01:22:51,545
SAM: Two plus something?

1220
01:22:51,545 --> 01:22:56,257
STEFANIE: Two plus two is four. Is that enough? I
don't want to kill him anyway. It's okay.

1221
01:22:56,257 --> 01:23:02,686
SAM: A crossbow bolt slams into his shoulder. He
screams out (whimper), but he's still alive, he's

1222
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:10,434
just pretty badly hurt. That was Goldilocks. It is
now the scared one's turn. Does he get to resist?

1223
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:19,721
Shake off the menace? I'm going to say he does.
And he rolled very well. He is no longer

1224
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:26,652
frightened of you, Scarecrow, and so he is going
to turn around and come back towards you,

1225
01:23:26,652 --> 01:23:28,374
Scarecrow.

1226
01:23:28,374 --> 01:23:29,946
STEFANIE: The one on top is injured.

1227
01:23:29,946 --> 01:23:34,510
SAM: Yes, he is. But I don't think he can use his
action, because he used it to shake off the

1228
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:49,481
effect. And next is the guy you just shot. Twin 2.
He is going to shoot back down at you, Goldilocks,

1229
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:54,331
because you're right there, and he rolled a 12 to
hit.

1230
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:58,288
STEFANIE: Does my Shield last in all of this
combat?

1231
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:03,882
SAM: One round. We're at the top of the second
round, so no, it doesn't. He rolled a 12. Did he

1232
01:24:03,882 --> 01:24:06,771
hit you? With your AC of--?

1233
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:08,538
STEFANIE: 16.

1234
01:24:08,538 --> 01:24:12,606
SAM: So no! He throws a rock at you. The rock
misses you and goes into the water behind you.

1235
01:24:12,606 --> 01:24:16,110
That's the end of their turn. Peter Pan, you are
up.

1236
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:22,502
NOELLE: Okay, I'm going to run. How far am I from
the edge of the ship?

1237
01:24:22,502 --> 01:24:29,654
SAM: From this edge of the ship, you're about 20
feet. And from way over there, I don't know, 50?

1238
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:34,586
NOELLE: From the edge of the-- The one right
there.

1239
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:38,506
SAM: 20.

1240
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:44,215
NOELLE: Okay. I'm going to take a big running
start, and I'm going to use my Jump spell to leap

1241
01:24:44,215 --> 01:24:54,483
onto the other ship. It's a long jump, I think I
can go pretty far, up to 40 feet.

1242
01:24:54,483 --> 01:25:01,881
SAM: Okay, so we see in slow motion, Peter Pan, it
almost looks like flying. He takes off into the

1243
01:25:01,881 --> 01:25:07,975
air, does this move, looks back at you guys to
make sure you're watching, does a little bit of a

1244
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:13,256
flip and lands. Three-point landing, super cool,
on the deck of the ship.

1245
01:25:13,256 --> 01:25:17,621
NOELLE: Okay, so who's this child who's passed out
near me?

1246
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:22,844
SAM: That's either Nibs or the first twin.

1247
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:27,384
NOELLE: I'm going to tie that one up.

1248
01:25:27,384 --> 01:25:29,623
SAM: Okay.

1249
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:31,166
NOELLE: Yeah, I have rope.

1250
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:43,127
SAM: Sure. Yes, you pull out a length of rope.
Hold on one second, I'm looking up Sleep. When

1251
01:25:43,127 --> 01:25:50,958
does it break?

1252
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:54,080
NOELLE: A minute. It's been significantly less
than that.

1253
01:25:54,080 --> 01:26:02,122
YURI: If they get shaken awake or attacked.

1254
01:26:02,122 --> 01:26:03,816
NOELLE: I very, very gently--

1255
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:12,819
SAM: So he's still asleep as you tie him up. He is
now tied up and unable to move. Great, good job,

1256
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:21,101
Peter. That's the end of your turn? Yeah? Okay.
Wendy or the Queen or the Hatter. Who wants to go?

1257
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:22,636
MOLLY: Is the boat still moving?

1258
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:27,258
SAM: The boat is still moving, yes, but ever so
slightly. The bridge seems to have slowed it down

1259
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:29,218
a little bit.

1260
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:37,222
AMY: I'm still raging, and I see the enemy in
sight, and I run forward and attack. Melee attack

1261
01:26:37,222 --> 01:26:40,145
the mast that the tiny man is standing on!

1262
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:41,994
SAM: You're going to hit the mast.

1263
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:44,547
AMY: Yes! Get on down here!

1264
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:48,526
SAM: What's your movement?

1265
01:26:48,526 --> 01:26:50,129
AMY: It's 30.

1266
01:26:50,129 --> 01:26:53,554
SAM: You can get to the mast, and you hit it
hard.

1267
01:26:53,554 --> 01:27:00,411
AMY: Come here! I said Mommy's home! Come give me
a hug! I'm going to do two attacks because I can

1268
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:02,360
bony action.

1269
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,334
YURI: Whoa, whoa!

1270
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:18,089
AMY: I can frenzy and I get a bonus action. I can
take a melee attack as my bonus action.

1271
01:27:18,089 --> 01:27:20,101
YURI: Boner action.

1272
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:31,341
AMY: Okay, and they're both at advantage, so 19
and 16. The lowest one would be a 21 to hit.

1273
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:33,179
SAM: Yes, that hits the mast.

1274
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:44,366
AMY: Okay, so I have two hits that hit, and that's
a 12 damage and another 12 damage.

1275
01:27:44,366 --> 01:27:49,171
SAM: Oh, wow. That's 24 points of damage to the
mast. What are you hacking with?

1276
01:27:49,171 --> 01:27:51,045
AMY: My scepter!

1277
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:55,971
SAM: So the scepter is causing huge chunks of wood
to fly out of the mast. The whole thing is

1278
01:27:55,971 --> 01:28:08,176
shaking. It does not collapse. Twin number two up
there at the top gets shaken off of the top but

1279
01:28:08,176 --> 01:28:15,721
manages to grab on with his natural 20 and is
holding with his-- He's got a bolt sticking out of

1280
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:19,317
this arm and with this arm he's holding on. He is
still up there. He did not fall off.

1281
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:21,687
AMY: You preventer of love.

1282
01:28:21,687 --> 01:28:24,302
STEFANIE: That is a resilient child.

1283
01:28:24,302 --> 01:28:31,824
MOLLY: Can I flap over and grab him, not attacking
for damage, but just yank him?

1284
01:28:31,824 --> 01:28:40,086
SAM: Sure, like a grapple? All right, So
Wendy-bird flies over and grabs the child. Roll

1285
01:28:40,086 --> 01:28:41,744
for a grapple.

1286
01:28:41,744 --> 01:28:43,556
MOLLY: Can he get disadvantage? Because he's
dangling?

1287
01:28:43,556 --> 01:28:45,540
SAM: Of course. He's got one arm and he's using
the other to hold on.

1288
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:49,249
MOLLY: Damn, I only got a nine. I am very strong,
though.

1289
01:28:49,249 --> 01:28:50,805
NOELLE: Do you want to borrow some dice?

1290
01:28:50,805 --> 01:28:52,180
MOLLY: I got nine.

1291
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:55,503
SAM: You know what, you roll with advantage
instead of him rolling with disadvantage.

1292
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:57,113
MOLLY: 11.

1293
01:28:57,113 --> 01:29:02,331
SAM: Sure. That's enough. He's like this. You're a
giant eagle. You pick him up. You have him in your

1294
01:29:02,331 --> 01:29:04,732
claws but you're not causing him any damage,
right?

1295
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:11,492
MOLLY: No, I've just got him in a grip. And then
I'm going to go land on the prow of the boat.

1296
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:19,213
YURI: Why don't you go up there and call it a ship
the way it's supposed to be called? There are

1297
01:29:19,213 --> 01:29:21,778
thousands of people out there going, "It's not a
boat, it's a ship!"

1298
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:29,086
MOLLY: Slightly to port, the port side. And I sort
of protect him with my claws, so that the Queen

1299
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:30,611
can't get him.

1300
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:34,797
SAM: The Hatter? The Crazy Hatter, what would you
like to do?

1301
01:29:34,797 --> 01:29:39,661
YURI: I would like to run across the gangplank,
because it seems like the ship I'm on sucks.

1302
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:43,835
H MICHAEL: I like how none of us are checking to
see if these dudes are alive.

1303
01:29:43,835 --> 01:29:45,508
NOELLE: No, they're fine. They're fine.

1304
01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:47,358
SAM: This guy's on fire.

1305
01:29:47,358 --> 01:29:49,279
H MICHAEL: Probably dead.

1306
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,634
MOLLY: There's a lot of other people on this
cruise, somewhere. They stayed below decks.

1307
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:57,446
SAM: Hatter, would you like to do anything else?
You can see one combatant who's out on the deck.

1308
01:29:57,446 --> 01:30:02,466
He's over here, and you can also see this guy in
the eagle's claws.

1309
01:30:02,466 --> 01:30:11,163
YURI: I will cast a Firebolt at the guy on deck.

1310
01:30:11,163 --> 01:30:29,042
SAM: Okay, yes, you can just see. Go ahead and
cast your Firebolt. That's what you add to your

1311
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,200
roll, spell attack bonus.

1312
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,748
YURI: 17 plus four.

1313
01:30:33,748 --> 01:30:36,527
SAM: You hit him for sure. Roll your damage.

1314
01:30:36,527 --> 01:30:41,667
YURI: It's a d10. A six.

1315
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:45,709
SAM: That guy dead.

1316
01:30:45,709 --> 01:30:50,538
YURI: I killed a child, guys! With fire!

1317
01:30:50,538 --> 01:31:03,952
SAM: A bolt of fire comes out of the Mad Hatter's
body. Hand? Out of his boutonniere a bolt of fire

1318
01:31:03,952 --> 01:31:09,099
streaks across the ship, striking the child dead
in the heart. He looks stunned for a second and

1319
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:12,766
then collapses, dead, or at least severely
unconscious right there.

1320
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:20,610
H MICHAEL: Can I do a reaction here based on the
fact that he just shot fire by a giant stack of hay?

1321
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,820
SAM: Sure. What reaction?

1322
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:27,353
H MICHAEL: I turn to the Hatter and go: What the
fuck, man?! What the fuck are you thinking?! Do

1323
01:31:27,353 --> 01:31:33,817
you not know any non-flammable spells?! I'm in the
line of fire, dude, I thought we were cool!

1324
01:31:33,817 --> 01:31:36,857
YURI: I squirt water out of my boutonniere on you.

1325
01:31:36,857 --> 01:31:46,124
SAM: That was the Hatter. Queen of Hearts, you've
gone. Wendy's gone. Everyone's gone, it's back to

1326
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:53,890
the top of the round. Scarecrow, it's your move,
but all of them are sleeping, dead, or

1327
01:31:53,890 --> 01:32:00,674
incapacitated. You notice that this ship is
starting to move away and the bridge is starting

1328
01:32:00,674 --> 01:32:07,933
to collapse. You probably have a second or two
before the bridge falls and you fall into the

1329
01:32:07,933 --> 01:32:13,808
water. Scarecrow, what would you like to do? Oh,
you're already on the ship. You're okay.

1330
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:24,717
H MICHAEL: There's only a second or two left, I'm
pretty strong. Yeah. I'm going to try to, in one

1331
01:32:24,717 --> 01:32:31,977
motion, swing this whole wooden ladder onto the
boat.

1332
01:32:31,977 --> 01:32:37,722
SAM: You run over to the gangplank and pull as
hard as you can, trying to get your friends on

1333
01:32:37,722 --> 01:32:40,747
board the ship with you. Roll for strength.

1334
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:42,007
H MICHAEL: 12.

1335
01:32:42,007 --> 01:32:48,746
SAM: You definitely pull it, but it gets to about
there and then falls into the water. Goldilocks

1336
01:32:48,746 --> 01:32:55,391
and the Hatter, roll dexterity saves. Is that a
cricket in the studio?

1337
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:57,427
YURI: Probably.

1338
01:32:57,427 --> 01:32:59,898
STEFANIE: Yeah!

1339
01:32:59,898 --> 01:33:02,285
H MICHAEL: Always good for a sound stage.

1340
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:04,120
STEFANIE: What'd you get?

1341
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,530
YURI: Eight plus three. 11.

1342
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:08,749
STEFANIE: 17 plus two is 19.

1343
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:14,407
SAM: Goldilocks holds on easily to the gangplank
and watches as the Hatter slides by her.

1344
01:33:14,407 --> 01:33:16,860
YURI: That's what I get for killing a child!

1345
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,769
STEFANIE: Can I reach out?

1346
01:33:18,769 --> 01:33:27,248
SAM: You needed to hold on for yourself. I'll say
you can reach out with your foot and Hatter, you

1347
01:33:27,248 --> 01:33:32,619
can make one more acrobatics check to see if you
can grab onto the foot.

1348
01:33:32,619 --> 01:33:40,222
YURI: Nope! You don't even to need to know what I
rolled!

1349
01:33:40,222 --> 01:33:44,462
SAM: Her slipper has salt water on it, your hand
slides off and you are now in the water.

1350
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:48,297
AMY: No!

1351
01:33:48,297 --> 01:33:53,218
YURI: Guys, it's the Caribbean, so don't cry for
me too badly. This is balmy.

1352
01:33:53,218 --> 01:33:55,576
H MICHAEL: I get one action and one attack,
right?

1353
01:33:55,576 --> 01:34:01,842
SAM: You get one action and you get a bonus action
where you can hit someone with your hand because

1354
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,062
you're a monk.

1355
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,576
H MICHAEL: But that doesn't help.

1356
01:34:04,576 --> 01:34:05,808
SAM: Sorry.

1357
01:34:05,808 --> 01:34:07,900
H MICHAEL: Sorry, dude, trying to help!

1358
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,720
YURI: I appreciate it, man, I do.

1359
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,086
MOLLY: Are we still in initiative?

1360
01:34:11,086 --> 01:34:17,138
SAM: We are still in initiative because there's a
guy. It is not his turn, it's Goldilocks' turn.

1361
01:34:17,138 --> 01:34:25,450
STEFANIE: I wasn't ever feeling like I wanted to
be a mom, but upon seeing a child get killed, my

1362
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:31,993
maternal instincts kick in and I'm like: You're a
horrible human being! Or Hatter of the crazy

1363
01:34:31,993 --> 01:34:35,290
variety. And so I don't know if I want to save
you.

1364
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:37,051
YURI: Fair enough.

1365
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:38,140
H MICHAEL: Wow!

1366
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,098
STEFANIE: Is there any way to heal the dead kid?

1367
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:43,116
SAM: You would have to climb back onto the ship
first.

1368
01:34:43,116 --> 01:34:47,601
STEFANIE: Okay, I'm going to climb back onto the
ship first. I'm going to approach the kid.

1369
01:34:47,601 --> 01:34:54,453
SAM: You can probably get to about there, but I
don't know what your healing powers are, Goldilocks.

1370
01:34:54,453 --> 01:35:02,804
You don't have any. You can say nice things to
him.

1371
01:35:02,804 --> 01:35:07,357
STEFANIE: I just want to talk to the dead kid.

1372
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:14,586
SAM: You can use your dash action to get all the
way to the kid, and now you can talk to him.

1373
01:35:14,586 --> 01:35:21,593
STEFANIE: Hey, if you just hold on I might have a
healer friend. I don't know, but I hope you had a

1374
01:35:21,593 --> 01:35:28,878
good life. You're not going to have anyone else
read you anything. I'm real bad at this. You were

1375
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:42,889
a great kid. I hope you're okay wherever you are.
The Crazy Hatter's a real dick. Definitely not

1376
01:35:42,889 --> 01:35:49,213
going to date him, don't worry. I'll try to turn
as many women as I know against him. You should've

1377
01:35:49,213 --> 01:35:52,856
had a better life and got education and--

1378
01:35:52,856 --> 01:35:58,359
SAM: So as you say all this to this young child
you see out of the corner of his eyes blood is

1379
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:02,190
dripping out of his eyes because he is super
dead.

1380
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:09,616
STEFANIE: Are you alive? No? Oh, I don't have great
charisma or anything either so I can't, that's it,

1381
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:12,778
I'm done. I keep muttering to the child to try--

1382
01:36:12,778 --> 01:36:21,143
SAM: Sure! Okay, that was Goldilocks. We're up to
the twin who is currently grappled. He's going to

1383
01:36:21,143 --> 01:36:25,260
try to ungrapple. Ooh, he rolled a 19.

1384
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:30,284
What's your strength, Wendy?

1385
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:33,095
MOLLY: Right now, it's 16.

1386
01:36:33,095 --> 01:36:34,951
SAM: I think he breaks your grapple.

1387
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:36,576
MOLLY: He wiggled his way free.

1388
01:36:36,576 --> 01:36:39,581
SAM: Yeah! He's free and going to run away.

1389
01:36:39,581 --> 01:36:41,942
MOLLY: I'm distracted by the murdered child that I
know and is my friend--

1390
01:36:41,942 --> 01:36:46,524
YURI: You guys say what you want but that one
child is going to kill all of us!

1391
01:36:46,524 --> 01:36:51,907
SAM: As that child runs away, he runs right past
Goldilocks. Goldilocks, as he is crossing in front

1392
01:36:51,907 --> 01:37:00,319
of you, you have an attack of opportunity. You can hit
him as he goes. If you'd like to, or grab him.

1393
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:05,076
MOLLY: You can choose to deal subdual damage which
knocks him unconscious

1394
01:37:05,076 --> 01:37:09,311
STEFANIE: Yeah. I would like to not kill the child
that would definitely--

1395
01:37:09,311 --> 01:37:10,930
SAM: Okay, roll for an attack!

1396
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:17,150
H MICHAEL: We're getting so much shit for just
killing one, <i>one</i> imaginary kid!

1397
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,426
STEFANIE: 18!

1398
01:37:18,426 --> 01:37:24,153
SAM: As he runs by, (panicked breathing) he gets
hit in the back of the head, falls down also

1399
01:37:24,153 --> 01:37:25,304
unconscious.

1400
01:37:25,304 --> 01:37:27,338
STEFANIE: And I say: It's safer for you this way.

1401
01:37:27,338 --> 01:37:28,914
SAM: Down but not dead!

1402
01:37:28,914 --> 01:37:31,153
YURI: The Hatter can't get you now.

1403
01:37:31,153 --> 01:37:39,395
SAM: At this point the gangplank has fallen away,
the ship is still moving away. That was

1404
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:43,081
Goldilocks. Peter's turn? Wait, did we do Peter?

1405
01:37:43,081 --> 01:37:44,768
NOELLE: I haven't gone yet. No.

1406
01:37:44,768 --> 01:37:46,137
SAM: Okay, go for it, Peter.

1407
01:37:46,137 --> 01:37:50,125
NOELLE: Is there a life preserver or anything near
by, or some rope?

1408
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:57,768
SAM: There's definitely rope. There's the main
sheet is dangling down from the mast. There's also

1409
01:37:57,768 --> 01:38:00,036
coils of rope on the floor that you can get.

1410
01:38:00,036 --> 01:38:04,604
NOELLE: I'm going to get some of those coils of
rope and I'm going to toss it to The Hatter. And

1411
01:38:04,604 --> 01:38:13,521
I'm going to use my bardic inspiration to give him
1d6 to any ability check he might try to make.

1412
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:18,820
SAM: Okay. So Peter Pan either speaks, or sings,
or plays--

1413
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:21,715
NOELLE: (singing) Hang on dude, I got you.

1414
01:38:21,715 --> 01:38:28,449
SAM: The words are so inspiring that you get an
extra d6 dice that you can add on to your next

1415
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:31,792
roll-- Because you feel so inspired by Peter Pan's
words.

1416
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:36,898
YURI: I know I'm in the water treading water, but
can I cast a spell?

1417
01:38:36,898 --> 01:38:43,242
SAM: Sure, it is now your turn, and yes you have
an action, a movement, and a bonus action.

1418
01:38:43,242 --> 01:38:48,821
YURI: Misty Step is actually a bonus action. Can I
use my bonus action first?

1419
01:38:48,821 --> 01:38:50,260
SAM: Yes!

1420
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:57,404
YURI: And I'm closer than 30 feet away. So I would
like to Misty Step aboard the deck. Which is sort

1421
01:38:57,404 --> 01:38:59,345
of like the Electric Slide.

1422
01:38:59,345 --> 01:39:08,325
SAM: So before Peter Pan finishes his words of
inspiration. Poof. Mad Hat-- I'm sorry, The Hatter

1423
01:39:08,325 --> 01:39:10,762
is standing right next to Peter--

1424
01:39:10,762 --> 01:39:12,842
YURI: We're all going to jail before the end of
the night!

1425
01:39:12,842 --> 01:39:15,835
SAM: Looking thankfully, gratefully, into Peter
Pan's eyes--

1426
01:39:15,835 --> 01:39:18,816
H MICHAEL: Mickey fucking kicks through this right
over here. Oh! I said Mickey--

1427
01:39:18,816 --> 01:39:22,425
NOELLE: Shh! Don't let the Mouse hear you!

1428
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:24,595
H MICHAEL: Just a guy I know named Mickey.

1429
01:39:24,595 --> 01:39:26,260
YURI: Stop being so <i>Goofy</i>.

1430
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,292
H MICHAEL: (laughing) He bursts through this wall
with a gun.

1431
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:38,961
YURI: Do I have time to get over to the kid whose
life is draining away? That's clear across the ship.

1432
01:39:38,961 --> 01:39:43,086
SAM: You did cause it so you know that he is
suffering. You don't have time to get all the--

1433
01:39:43,086 --> 01:39:45,876
Yeah, we're out of initiative now, the fight is
over--

1434
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:51,586
NOELLE: I mean, he could have six extra points if
he wanted them. Whatever! It's fine.

1435
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:56,808
SAM: Oh yeah, that's right. So, yes, things are
calm, everyone is either asleep or dead, so you can

1436
01:39:57,165 --> 01:39:59,307
take a couple of turns and walk over there.

1437
01:39:59,307 --> 01:40:06,226
YURI: So I go over to where the kid is lying and
sing him a lullaby--

1438
01:40:06,226 --> 01:40:12,730
SAM: Is there a particular spell attached to that
lullaby or is it just a nice song?

1439
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:17,074
YURI: I wish I had healing abilities. It's just a
song to help--

1440
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:20,741
NOELLE: If we're out of initiative, would you
consider this a short rest?

1441
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:24,836
SAM: You guys can take a short rest. Short rest
would be like 20 or 25 minutes of-- Yes, Molly?

1442
01:40:24,836 --> 01:40:30,899
MOLLY: Oh, sorry. Wendy, as you're getting pulled
out of the water and going over to the kid, she

1443
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:38,213
turns out of eagle form and runs over to the kid
who got killed. As you're singing a lullaby, she

1444
01:40:38,213 --> 01:40:40,120
shoulders you aside.

1445
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,892
YURI: (singing) Down in the wind-- (yells)

1446
01:40:42,892 --> 01:40:51,512
MOLLY: And she leans down and picks up the kid and
casts Cure Wounds on him. I don't know if that

1447
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,460
will do anything because he's dead but--

1448
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:57,632
SAM: Cure Wounds is what? 1d8 plus three or
something like that?

1449
01:40:57,632 --> 01:41:01,829
MOLLY: 1d8 plus spellcasting ability.

1450
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:04,558
SAM: Yeah, he's dead.

1451
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:06,818
MOLLY: Well, I'll just give it a shot, you know?

1452
01:41:06,818 --> 01:41:10,837
SAM: Just roll to see if luck shines on you.

1453
01:41:10,837 --> 01:41:15,801
MOLLY: That's a nine.

1454
01:41:15,801 --> 01:41:23,240
SAM: The kid coughs.

1455
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:27,106
STEFANIE: Whoa. Somebody do CPR!

1456
01:41:27,106 --> 01:41:29,119
SAM: And passes out again.

1457
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:30,885
NOELLE: Okay, is this a short rest or not?

1458
01:41:30,885 --> 01:41:33,050
SAM: A short rest is 25 minutes long.

1459
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,425
NOELLE: Well, we could take some time.

1460
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:42,370
SAM: Sure. He's very faintly breathing. His pulse
is almost at a standstill. Someone else would have

1461
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,618
to do something very quickly in order to save
him.

1462
01:41:44,618 --> 01:41:46,712
H MICHAEL: Can anyone act here?

1463
01:41:46,712 --> 01:41:49,133
SAM: Anyone can act, yes. We're out of battle.

1464
01:41:49,133 --> 01:41:56,505
NOELLE: I start playing my pan pipes, beautifully,
and seeing as it is a short rest, any friends that

1465
01:41:56,505 --> 01:42:00,753
hear my performance, they regain 1d6 HP.

1466
01:42:00,753 --> 01:42:06,360
SAM: Okay. So you're playing a jaunty ditty or a
beautiful ballad?

1467
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,999
NOELLE: Like a really poignant tune.

1468
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:11,796
SAM: Okay. So it's Enya or something.

1469
01:42:11,796 --> 01:42:16,536
NOELLE: Yeah, yeah! Like Enya meets Wonderwall.
Really inspiring.

1470
01:42:16,536 --> 01:42:18,291
SAM: So why don't you roll a d6--

1471
01:42:18,291 --> 01:42:19,640
NOELLE: Oh, I do that.

1472
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:26,885
SAM: And everyone within earshot regains four hit
points because of the beauty of the pan flute

1473
01:42:26,885 --> 01:42:28,563
H MICHAEL: Thank you very much!

1474
01:42:28,563 --> 01:42:38,356
SAM: The boy comes to. He seems to be just okay.
Yes, Nibs-- Wait, no, was this Slightly or Nibs?

1475
01:42:38,356 --> 01:42:40,170
NOELLE: I just made it up. I just made one up--

1476
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:43,145
SAM: Slightly was the dead one! Yeah, no, this is
Slightly.

1477
01:42:43,145 --> 01:42:45,652
H MICHAEL: He was only Slightly dead!

1478
01:42:45,652 --> 01:42:48,500
(laughter)

1479
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:52,410
H MICHAEL: All right, I'm taking off, you guys!
Nice seeing everyone!

1480
01:42:52,410 --> 01:43:02,427
SAM: He's looking real rough, but he is alive.
Blood still covers his face. You also notice that

1481
01:43:02,427 --> 01:43:11,100
he stinks, all these sleeping boys have the worst
body odor. They are unkempt, wild eyed. The crisis

1482
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:14,150
is averted. Calm settles over the ship--

1483
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:17,122
NOELLE: Can I just tie up any of the other boys
who are sleeping real quick? I just tie them all

1484
01:43:17,122 --> 01:43:19,573
to the mast.

1485
01:43:19,573 --> 01:43:28,313
SAM: Sure. They're all tied to the mast, all in a
circle, just like the Peter Pan book.

1486
01:43:28,313 --> 01:43:30,555
MOLLY: What the hell are you guys doing?

1487
01:43:30,555 --> 01:43:31,910
SAM: Do you want to wake them up?

1488
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:33,521
MOLLY: I think they wake up after a minute.

1489
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:36,841
SAM: Oh, yes! So a minute has passed, they all
come to, they're all tied up.

1490
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:42,212
MOLLY: What the hell are you guys doing?!

1491
01:43:42,212 --> 01:43:46,307
SAM: "What are we doing? What are you doing? Why
did you two break up?"

1492
01:43:46,307 --> 01:43:48,889
MOLLY: It's been like eight years!

1493
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:56,744
SAM: "I know, but in Neverland time moves
differently! We never grow up! We just want a

1494
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:58,236
"mama--"

1495
01:43:58,236 --> 01:44:05,843
MOLLY: These are-- I can't. It's your turn to
shine. I cannot be a mother to these smelly stupid

1496
01:44:05,843 --> 01:44:07,416
idiot children anymore!

1497
01:44:07,416 --> 01:44:11,279
AMY: Well, look here.

1498
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:12,924
MOLLY: Here's your new mom!

1499
01:44:12,924 --> 01:44:22,520
AMY: Excuse me? I do in a relationship want to be
the mommy-- Are any of you interested in having a

1500
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,508
sexual relationship with me?

1501
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,086
(laughter)

1502
01:44:26,086 --> 01:44:31,314
MOLLY: I grab her and pull her back. Yeah, I put
my hand over your mouth--

1503
01:44:31,314 --> 01:44:33,389
SAM: One of the kids starts crying.

1504
01:44:33,389 --> 01:44:37,490
STEFANIE: I say, listen, I don't know what your problem
is--

1505
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:44,864
AMY: Mothership mother. This is not the Jolly
Roger anymore, it is the Mothership!

1506
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:47,191
(laughter)

1507
01:44:47,191 --> 01:44:48,987
STEFANIE: I say, Get away from the Mothership!

1508
01:44:48,987 --> 01:44:51,550
AMY: I'm not doing anything wrong here!

1509
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:53,113
STEFANIE: I say, they're 12!

1510
01:44:53,113 --> 01:44:56,116
MOLLY: They're very small and very smelly. They're
very stupid--

1511
01:44:56,116 --> 01:44:58,814
STEFANIE: Ugh! I can't, I'm an adult person.

1512
01:44:58,814 --> 01:45:05,584
NOELLE: Okay. Okay, guys. Guys, what's going on?
Why are you doing this? What happened, man?

1513
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:10,382
SAM: "We need someone to take care of us, and ever
since you broke up, Neverland's turned to shite."

1514
01:45:10,382 --> 01:45:13,727
AMY: Neverland? Is this a kingdom I could
acquire?

1515
01:45:13,727 --> 01:45:15,615
SAM: "You have to believe to get there."

1516
01:45:15,615 --> 01:45:17,367
AMY: I don't know--

1517
01:45:17,367 --> 01:45:21,689
YURI: So you guys need a dad? Because I think I'd
make a great dad!

1518
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:25,316
SAM: (crying) "You killed our friend!"

1519
01:45:25,316 --> 01:45:28,637
NOELLE: He's alive again, all right?

1520
01:45:28,637 --> 01:45:31,545
SAM: "Oh, that's right."

1521
01:45:31,545 --> 01:45:35,881
NOELLE: Look, Wendy and I are like wild horses, we
have to go our separate ways. But if she wanted to

1522
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:40,562
get back together, you know, I would be okay with
that. But if not, I would also be okay with that.

1523
01:45:40,562 --> 01:45:43,199
SAM: "Are you saying that there's a chance you
might be able to get back together?"

1524
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,339
NOELLE: Look, I have lots of other options--

1525
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:50,400
MOLLY: Our relationship fell apart because we had
seven tiny, grubby children hanging on to us at

1526
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,504
all times. I'm not ready to be a mom!

1527
01:45:52,504 --> 01:45:57,288
SAM: "So it was our fault?" (crying)

1528
01:45:57,288 --> 01:45:59,760
MOLLY: Yes, it was!

1529
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:06,780
STEFANIE: I interject and say: hey, I think that's
a really bad foundation for six or seven kids,

1530
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,453
however many were on this boat--

1531
01:46:08,453 --> 01:46:09,895
MOLLY: I keep losing track.

1532
01:46:09,895 --> 01:46:13,631
STEFANIE: On a side note, let's direct our
attention elsewhere. I want to roll a perception

1533
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:21,749
check, to see if-- I feel like the lifeboat was
taken by someone who might've known this attack

1534
01:46:21,749 --> 01:46:24,839
was coming. So I roll a 16--

1535
01:46:24,839 --> 01:46:33,156
SAM: That's great. As you glance back to the old
S.S. Public Domain, you catch the final glimpses

1536
01:46:33,156 --> 01:46:36,337
of the stern of it as it vanishes beneath the
water, sunken.

1537
01:46:36,337 --> 01:46:39,853
H MICHAEL: Wow, that means a lot of people died!

1538
01:46:39,853 --> 01:46:48,265
SAM: Debris litters the open ocean, but not a
single survivor is visible. You do spot, way in

1539
01:46:48,265 --> 01:46:55,420
the distance, a small lifeboat carrying a large
figure, furiously paddling away from the wreckage.

1540
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:04,261
You also notice that the helm of the Jolly Roger
is spinning back and forth, pilotless. Your vessel

1541
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:10,412
is drifting aimlessly in the water. You have no
direction. What would you like to do?

1542
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:12,532
NOELLE: I want to go drive it, at the lifeboat.

1543
01:47:12,532 --> 01:47:18,954
SAM: So Peter's going to go up to the helm. Take
it and roll a survival check, please.

1544
01:47:18,954 --> 01:47:21,915
NOELLE: Can I get advantage, since I've probably
steered a boat before?

1545
01:47:21,915 --> 01:47:25,633
SAM: Sure, you've stolen-- Advantage, why not?

1546
01:47:25,633 --> 01:47:30,947
NOELLE: Yeah, that's fine. I don't do it,
probably.

1547
01:47:30,947 --> 01:47:32,414
SAM: Well, what did you roll?

1548
01:47:32,414 --> 01:47:37,079
NOELLE: That is a nine.

1549
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:42,921
SAM: Sure, man. You straighten out the boat.
That's it. You are going straight.

1550
01:47:42,921 --> 01:47:44,930
NOELLE: I got this. Don't worry, guys.

1551
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:51,987
H MICHAEL: I want to check out the captain's
quarters. I walk over to the door to the captain's

1552
01:47:51,987 --> 01:47:57,140
quarters and I open it. I do a fucking look-around
check.

1553
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:01,731
SAM: Do an investigation check. Noelle, will you
point to investigation on his page?

1554
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:10,831
H MICHAEL: Plus zero, cool. 20! I see fucking
everything!

1555
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:20,837
SAM: Yes, you do. Natural 20, okay. Great, so you
look around the room. Any sign of food or clothing

1556
01:48:20,837 --> 01:48:29,284
has been picked clean. Also, a lot of the paper
has been ruined. It seems like they've been using

1557
01:48:29,284 --> 01:48:37,282
some of the navigational maps to wipe their ass
after they go number two. So a lot of the paper is

1558
01:48:37,282 --> 01:48:38,969
gone. You do find--

1559
01:48:38,969 --> 01:48:43,489
YURI: Not so sad that I killed one of them now,
huh?

1560
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:51,303
SAM: You find one piece of paper that looks really
interesting. But it's all ripped up to shreds.

1561
01:48:51,303 --> 01:48:55,171
(exclamations)

1562
01:48:55,171 --> 01:48:57,426
H MICHAEL: I've got to do a puzzle?

1563
01:48:57,426 --> 01:49:03,179
SAM: It's in two pieces. Oh shit, that part's all
together! Thank you.

1564
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:07,097
NOELLE: Wait, is this one of the ones they used to
wipe their asses or what?

1565
01:49:07,097 --> 01:49:09,899
YURI: I'll help you help us.

1566
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:18,995
SAM: It is definitely covered in fecal matter. One
fell on the floor.

1567
01:49:18,995 --> 01:49:25,487
H MICHAEL: You're doing great as a DM, but stop
throwing the puzzle pieces on the ground, okay?

1568
01:49:25,487 --> 01:49:32,898
SAM: Sorry. Also, H, you find a couple of items in
there.

1569
01:49:32,898 --> 01:49:38,163
H MICHAEL: Oh, sick. Are they guns? I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1570
01:49:38,163 --> 01:49:48,479
SAM: You find these two things in the ship. Peter,
as you are steering the ship, you notice that if

1571
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:54,260
you were to turn about 30 degrees to the right,
you might be able to intercept that lifeboat.

1572
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,791
NOELLE: Oh, I do that.

1573
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:58,665
SAM: Roll another survival check with advantage.

1574
01:49:58,665 --> 01:50:03,200
NOELLE: Ooh, that's much better, that is a 29 on
that.

1575
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:08,214
SAM: So you definitely pilot the craft easily, and
as you approach the lifeboat, you see the large

1576
01:50:08,214 --> 01:50:13,652
form of the Beast furiously paddling away from the
action. What would you like to do?

1577
01:50:13,652 --> 01:50:18,178
NOELLE: I'm going to use my Firebolt to blow a
hole in his ship.

1578
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:19,744
SAM: You are going to attack the Beast?

1579
01:50:19,744 --> 01:50:21,844
NOELLE: Yeah, I'm going to fucking attack the
Beast.

1580
01:50:21,844 --> 01:50:23,074
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

1581
01:50:23,074 --> 01:50:25,568
NOELLE: Only his boat, I'm aiming at his boat.

1582
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:27,365
SAM: Yeah, go ahead. Roll for an attack.

1583
01:50:27,365 --> 01:50:36,707
NOELLE: So that's a lot, that's 21.

1584
01:50:36,707 --> 01:50:43,134
SAM: You definitely hit the ship. Roll for damage
on the boat. This is a boat, not a ship. I know

1585
01:50:43,134 --> 01:50:44,822
sailing terms.

1586
01:50:44,822 --> 01:50:53,685
STEFANIE: Is Belle anywhere to be seen?

1587
01:50:53,685 --> 01:50:58,435
SAM: Belle does not exist. Beauty exists, the
public domain character.

1588
01:50:58,435 --> 01:51:01,946
STEFANIE: Do we see Beauty?

1589
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:06,472
YURI: But as you say Belle, the Hunchback goes,
"No!"

1590
01:51:06,472 --> 01:51:08,571
SAM: You do not see Beauty anywhere.

1591
01:51:08,571 --> 01:51:10,902
NOELLE: Okay, so that is a seven.

1592
01:51:10,902 --> 01:51:18,297
SAM: Okay, the front of his lifeboat explodes with
magical fire. You definitely got his attention, he

1593
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:25,484
turns to you and says: "Oh, oh, are you not a
pirate? Oh, please save me, please save me, we

1594
01:51:25,484 --> 01:51:26,843
"were being attacked."

1595
01:51:26,843 --> 01:51:33,187
NOELLE: I throw him the rope that I was going to
throw at the Hatter until he Misty Stepped out of it.

1596
01:51:33,187 --> 01:51:37,455
SAM: It takes a couple of minutes, but he uses the
boat to climb up and get onto the deck with you. I

1597
01:51:37,455 --> 01:51:42,716
guess you found the Scarecrow and you're helping
him put this puzzle back together?

1598
01:51:42,716 --> 01:51:50,600
AMY: Yes, and at any moment I get a chance, I
brush my fingers across the Hatter's fingers. And

1599
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,193
I pretend that nothing is happening.

1600
01:51:53,193 --> 01:51:59,888
H MICHAEL: I look over and I see the Queen of
Hearts using my move on another guy, and a single

1601
01:51:59,888 --> 01:52:04,011
dry dusty tear rolls down my face.

1602
01:52:04,011 --> 01:52:09,425
SAM: I'm just perceiving that, I think, some of
your pieces go to his, and his go to yours.

1603
01:52:09,425 --> 01:52:14,286
YURI: Okay, that's why this was so goddamn hard.

1604
01:52:14,286 --> 01:52:16,956
SAM: They must have gotten mixed up my bag.

1605
01:52:16,956 --> 01:52:18,574
NOELLE: Oh boy!

1606
01:52:18,574 --> 01:52:29,843
SAM: Don't worry, it will be great. The Beast
approaches Peter and Wendy and Goldilocks who are

1607
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:34,584
standing on the deck and says: "Oh, am I pleased
to see you lot. Let me assure you that you will

1608
01:52:34,584 --> 01:52:38,864
"all be given refunds from the Storybook Love
Singles Cruise Limited Liability Corporation, in

1609
01:52:38,864 --> 01:52:53,545
"the form of credits you can use on future cruises.
Are the pirates alive? Are we okay? Are we safe?"

1610
01:52:53,545 --> 01:52:57,110
STEFANIE: Did you kill Beauty? Were you done with
that relationship?

1611
01:52:57,110 --> 01:53:00,929
SAM: "What are you talking about? Did I kill-- I
don't have a pirate ship"

1612
01:53:00,929 --> 01:53:02,731
STEFANIE: Where is your wife?

1613
01:53:02,731 --> 01:53:05,286
SAM: "I don't know, I left her at the ship with
you."

1614
01:53:05,286 --> 01:53:12,024
NOELLE: You took the one lifeboat and sailed away
from the sinking ship, that you own, with your

1615
01:53:12,024 --> 01:53:13,233
wife on it.

1616
01:53:13,233 --> 01:53:15,065
STEFANIE: You wanted us to believe in true love?

1617
01:53:15,065 --> 01:53:16,689
SAM: "I was just--"

1618
01:53:16,689 --> 01:53:18,683
STEFANIE: And you left her to die?

1619
01:53:18,683 --> 01:53:20,607
MOLLY: This is the least romantic situation--

1620
01:53:20,607 --> 01:53:23,540
H MICHAEL: I get it dude, you have got to look out
for number one, you know.

1621
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:33,501
SAM: "I didn't know what to do. I was frightened,
my men had all died, and I apologize. I didn't

1622
01:53:33,501 --> 01:53:35,689
"mean to put you in peril, but I had nothing--"

1623
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:37,316
STEFANIE: Your wife!

1624
01:53:37,316 --> 01:53:39,215
SAM: "Is she okay?"

1625
01:53:39,215 --> 01:53:41,404
NOELLE: I would like to cast Zone of Truth.

1626
01:53:41,404 --> 01:53:44,860
SAM: Zone of Truth, go ahead. What is that and
what does it do?

1627
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:48,218
NOELLE: It makes him tell the truth to me, right
now.

1628
01:53:48,218 --> 01:53:51,241
SAM: Okay, your spellcasting DC is what?

1629
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:52,954
NOELLE: That is a 14.

1630
01:53:52,954 --> 01:53:56,891
SAM: Okay, hold on. I'm looking up.

1631
01:53:56,891 --> 01:53:59,606
NOELLE: I also don't know how to use this spell
very well.

1632
01:53:59,606 --> 01:54:07,984
SAM: No, that's okay, let me find the Beast's
stats. You said 14 was your-- And it's versus

1633
01:54:07,984 --> 01:54:14,274
charisma saving throw. Okay, what did you say it
was?

1634
01:54:14,274 --> 01:54:16,042
NOELLE: 14.

1635
01:54:16,042 --> 01:54:22,020
SAM: As you cast the spell, he looks at you oddly.
His eyes seem to shrink back for a moment, and

1636
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:30,890
then he looks at you again, harder, and says:
"What are you trying to do to me?" It does not work.

1637
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:34,542
MOLLY: Are we all in the Zone of Truth area?
Because I think it's an area effect, so are we all

1638
01:54:34,542 --> 01:54:35,789
affected by it?

1639
01:54:35,789 --> 01:54:37,276
NOELLE: Yes, you are.

1640
01:54:37,276 --> 01:54:44,442
MOLLY: The range is 60 feet, so we have to roll a
charisma saving throw, right?

1641
01:54:44,442 --> 01:54:54,560
SAM: Yes, charisma saving throw. I love how I
accidentally got rid of half of our players.

1642
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,262
Sorry, guys!

1643
01:54:57,262 --> 01:54:59,269
YURI: I love puzzles, Sam!

1644
01:54:59,269 --> 01:55:01,889
AMY: This is very important!

1645
01:55:01,889 --> 01:55:03,173
NOELLE: Wait, wait!

1646
01:55:03,173 --> 01:55:04,302
SAM: Wait what?

1647
01:55:04,302 --> 01:55:07,093
NOELLE: Does this count, if I can use my Jack of
All Trades to add half my proficiency bonus to my

1648
01:55:07,093 --> 01:55:09,056
ability check? Does that count as an ability
check?

1649
01:55:09,056 --> 01:55:13,603
SAM: No, it does not. You cannot add it to a
spellcasting ability.

1650
01:55:13,603 --> 01:55:17,155
STEFANIE: I want to roll a perception check on
Beast.

1651
01:55:17,155 --> 01:55:21,166
SAM: Just an insight check, right? Okay, roll a
d20 and add your insight to that.

1652
01:55:21,166 --> 01:55:23,175
STEFANIE: 18 plus--

1653
01:55:23,175 --> 01:55:36,248
SAM: Yeah, you got it. You can tell that he is not
telling you the whole story.

1654
01:55:36,248 --> 01:55:37,923
STEFANIE: Can I ask him questions?

1655
01:55:37,923 --> 01:55:39,271
SAM: Sure, you can ask him a question.

1656
01:55:39,271 --> 01:55:43,128
STEFANIE: Was your relationship troubled before
this cruise?

1657
01:55:43,128 --> 01:55:53,142
SAM: "Unfortunately, yes, it was troubled before
the cruise. I was looking at this voyage as a way

1658
01:55:53,142 --> 01:56:01,351
"to mend our broken bonds. We have been spending a
lot of time apart, and actually this is the first

1659
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:06,051
"cruise that she's agreed to come on in a long
time. I was hoping--"

1660
01:56:06,051 --> 01:56:08,159
H MICHAEL: Holy fuck, you guys!

1661
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,861
YURI: We just found out why!

1662
01:56:09,861 --> 01:56:17,176
H MICHAEL: We put together a bunch of shitty
pieces of shit paper, and it's a letter. It says,

1663
01:56:17,176 --> 01:56:22,869
"Dear Captain--" And then we're missing a piece.
"--soon we can be together and we can play 'hooky'

1664
01:56:22,869 --> 01:56:28,963
"all night long. Love Beauty." I have no idea what
that means, you guys!

1665
01:56:28,963 --> 01:56:31,690
SAM and NOELLE: You can read?

1666
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:36,994
H MICHAEL: I mean, I know basic sounds. I'm not
gonna add fucking meaning to them.

1667
01:56:36,994 --> 01:56:38,418
NOELLE: They are color-coded.

1668
01:56:38,418 --> 01:56:41,584
MOLLY: Wendy was affected by the Zone of Truth
spell, and she just leans in to the Beast and

1669
01:56:41,584 --> 01:56:44,287
she's like, sounds like your dead wife was
cheating on you.

1670
01:56:44,287 --> 01:56:51,114
SAM: "I suspected as much. I thought she was
cheating on me, but I thought that we could

1671
01:56:51,114 --> 01:56:58,635
"reconcile our differences. I had no idea who it
was, I had no idea it was Captain Jeremy Hook."

1672
01:56:58,635 --> 01:57:00,271
MOLLY: He gets around.

1673
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:02,848
STEFANIE: Wait, no, his head is on a mast.

1674
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,185
SAM: "Where?"

1675
01:57:04,185 --> 01:57:05,347
STEFANIE: Right there.

1676
01:57:05,347 --> 01:57:06,863
SAM: "Oh my god!"

1677
01:57:06,863 --> 01:57:12,772
STEFANIE: It wasn't him. I assure you he was there
during the whole attack.

1678
01:57:12,772 --> 01:57:14,873
SAM: "He did not attack our vessel?"

1679
01:57:14,873 --> 01:57:16,571
STEFANIE: No, the kids did.

1680
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:18,739
MOLLY: That head used to kiss your dead wife's
face.

1681
01:57:18,739 --> 01:57:20,068
SAM: "Oh god!"

1682
01:57:20,068 --> 01:57:21,604
STEFANIE: Wait, are we sure about that?

1683
01:57:21,604 --> 01:57:25,977
H MICHAEL: We are missing a piece.

1684
01:57:25,977 --> 01:57:29,720
AMY: She did use the clever pun "hooky."

1685
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:35,082
H MICHAEL: Yeah, but you don't know who it is.
It's Captain and then the initial is missing.

1686
01:57:35,082 --> 01:57:38,647
SAM: The Beast vomits over the side of the deck.

1687
01:57:38,647 --> 01:57:41,837
YURI: But she did say play hooky, that is sort of
a--

1688
01:57:41,837 --> 01:57:46,824
AMY: Let's say I were to flirt with Captain Hook,
I would make the exact same joke.

1689
01:57:46,824 --> 01:57:54,534
SAM: The Beast just vomited, you can see his skin
is ashen, he drops to his knees and starts sobbing

1690
01:57:54,534 --> 01:57:56,094
into his hands.

1691
01:57:56,094 --> 01:57:58,736
NOELLE: I would like to use Detect Thoughts on the
Beast.

1692
01:57:58,736 --> 01:58:07,334
SAM: All right. Let me find out how that works.
Okay, I will see-- I've got to roll against that.

1693
01:58:07,334 --> 01:58:09,263
You are marking off all your spells right?

1694
01:58:09,263 --> 01:58:11,357
NOELLE: I am, yes.

1695
01:58:11,357 --> 01:58:12,279
SAM: Sure you are.

1696
01:58:12,279 --> 01:58:14,323
YURI: We should totally Firebolt the Beast.

1697
01:58:14,323 --> 01:58:22,483
NOELLE: That is a cantrip, so I can have many of
those. I didn't choose very useful spells for my

1698
01:58:22,483 --> 01:58:28,088
top-tier spells.

1699
01:58:28,088 --> 01:58:33,077
SAM: Okay, yes. So you hear a voice inside your
head that is not your own voice, it's the Beast's

1700
01:58:33,077 --> 01:58:42,472
voice. The Beast is saying to himself: "My god, I
can't believe after all these years, she was

1701
01:58:42,472 --> 01:58:51,016
"cheating on me... with him. He's such a fucking
asshole, the way he parades around with his big

1702
01:58:51,016 --> 01:58:57,419
"ship and his little helper man Smee, what a
fucking asshole. I should have killed him when I

1703
01:58:57,419 --> 01:58:59,334
"had the chance." That's all you hear.

1704
01:58:59,334 --> 01:59:01,191
NOELLE: Interesting.

1705
01:59:01,191 --> 01:59:04,985
SAM: If you would like to probe deeper, you can.

1706
01:59:04,985 --> 01:59:08,131
NOELLE: I'll do that. How do I do that?

1707
01:59:08,131 --> 01:59:19,399
SAM: As an action, you just say, "I want to probe
deeper." Your spell DC is 14.

1708
01:59:19,399 --> 01:59:23,539
H MICHAEL: Right as she's about to probe deeper, I
shove Peter Pan to the ground.

1709
01:59:23,539 --> 01:59:25,300
NOELLE: Hey, what the fuck, man?!

1710
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:32,524
H MICHAEL: My face is wild. I suddenly say, did
you make fun of me for not being able to read? I

1711
01:59:32,524 --> 01:59:35,712
don't like it when people call me stupid.

1712
01:59:35,712 --> 01:59:42,189
NOELLE: I would never do that, man. I respect you.
I was just stating a fact that the note is

1713
01:59:42,189 --> 01:59:48,062
color-coded. And it's a beautiful note, you did
that, you put that back together. You did such a

1714
01:59:48,062 --> 01:59:49,370
good job.

1715
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:50,947
H MICHAEL: Okay, just don't anybody ever fucking
do that, okay?

1716
01:59:50,947 --> 01:59:52,280
NOELLE: I would never.

1717
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,382
H MICHAEL: Don't ever fucking do that.

1718
01:59:53,382 --> 01:59:55,280
NOELLE: I'm also not that smart, I understand.

1719
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,661
MOLLY: It's true.

1720
01:59:56,661 --> 02:00:01,079
H MICHAEL: I take a break. I go to the other side
of the ship and I lean over the edge and

1721
02:00:01,079 --> 02:00:02,317
hyperventilate.

1722
02:00:02,317 --> 02:00:04,091
NOELLE: Hang in there, buddy! I believe in you.

1723
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:10,882
SAM: Peter, right before he pushed you, you had
heard the Beast say, in his interior monologue,

1724
02:00:10,882 --> 02:00:17,013
you had heard him say, "I know what I must do now
and it will be glorious--" And that's all you

1725
02:00:17,013 --> 02:00:19,994
heard before Scarecrow pushed you over.

1726
02:00:19,994 --> 02:00:22,106
MOLLY: How long does Zone of Truth last for?

1727
02:00:22,106 --> 02:00:29,883
NOELLE: Who else was in it?

1728
02:00:29,883 --> 02:00:34,336
SAM: Well, no one's asking you anything.

1729
02:00:34,336 --> 02:00:37,839
STEFANIE: What am I rolling? Charisma?

1730
02:00:37,839 --> 02:00:42,402
SAM: Just roll a d20, add your charisma save.

1731
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:44,872
STEFANIE: 14.

1732
02:00:44,872 --> 02:00:50,610
SAM: Her spell DC is 14, right? So that affects
you. So you have to tell the truth if someone

1733
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:52,258
talks to you for the next minute.

1734
02:00:52,258 --> 02:00:56,195
NOELLE: So it says that it is a 15-foot radius and
until the spell ends, a creature that enters the

1735
02:00:56,195 --> 02:01:00,671
spell's area for the first-- oh, for the first
time. Never mind. Forget it. I had an idea, but it

1736
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:02,204
didn't work. It's fine.

1737
02:01:02,204 --> 02:01:03,796
MOLLY: Scarecrow has to roll too.

1738
02:01:03,796 --> 02:01:09,710
SAM: Just roll a d20, add your charisma save, see
if you are telling the truth, which (whispering)

1739
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:11,529
he always is, guys.

1740
02:01:11,529 --> 02:01:12,714
H MICHAEL: 15.

1741
02:01:12,714 --> 02:01:14,011
NOELLE: Scarecrow passed.

1742
02:01:14,011 --> 02:01:23,722
SAM: Okay. The crisis is averted, calm settles
over the ship. So you found the thing, Beast is

1743
02:01:23,722 --> 02:01:28,958
crying. What would you guys like to do? You're
drifting at sea.

1744
02:01:28,958 --> 02:01:39,958
AMY: I go up to the Scarecrow, who seems alone. I
put my arm around you. I say, did I detect a

1745
02:01:39,958 --> 02:01:42,771
showing of strength back there?

1746
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:49,399
H MICHAEL: I just don't like it when people say
that I'm dumb.

1747
02:01:49,399 --> 02:01:52,722
AMY: But you did stand up for yourself.

1748
02:01:52,722 --> 02:01:55,831
H MICHAEL: Yeah. I'm getting tired of this ship.

1749
02:01:55,831 --> 02:02:05,385
AMY: Well, might I say that I did not expect that
to come from a pile of straw and refuse.

1750
02:02:05,385 --> 02:02:14,870
H MICHAEL: Thank you. I put my hand over her hand
onto her shoulder and I nod my shoulder and I look

1751
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:16,950
out at the ocean.

1752
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:19,935
STEFANIE: And then I come up because I'm in the
Zone of Truth. I'm like, and I have to say, I

1753
02:02:19,935 --> 02:02:22,181
thought that was really hot.

1754
02:02:22,181 --> 02:02:24,834
(laughter)

1755
02:02:24,834 --> 02:02:32,404
SAM: I love it. The Beast composes himself, wipes
the tears from his face and says, "I don't know

1756
02:02:32,404 --> 02:02:40,137
"what to do now, but we must get to a port. From
the looks of this vessel, we don't have any

1757
02:02:40,137 --> 02:02:47,205
"provisions. We can't possibly go back the way we
came; the trade winds will-- it'll take days.

1758
02:02:47,205 --> 02:02:54,694
"Might I suggest that we continue on to Pleasure
Island, which is a half day's journey, and when we

1759
02:02:54,694 --> 02:03:00,746
"get there, my employees will be waiting for us.
Food will be there, medical attention-- we could

1760
02:03:00,746 --> 02:03:04,520
"do something with these disgusting children all
about."

1761
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:07,413
YURI: It's called Pleasure Island. Yes! Yes, we'll
go!

1762
02:03:07,413 --> 02:03:14,599
NOELLE: Yeah, no question. Why don't you go take a
nap and we'll drive the ship to Pleasure Island?

1763
02:03:14,599 --> 02:03:15,841
SAM: "All right."

1764
02:03:15,841 --> 02:03:17,986
NOELLE: Wendy, I got to talk to you--

1765
02:03:17,986 --> 02:03:22,458
MOLLY: Peter... It just seems like we can't escape
our past no matter where we go.

1766
02:03:22,458 --> 02:03:25,155
(laughter)

1767
02:03:25,155 --> 02:03:27,305
MOLLY: We have so much history together.

1768
02:03:27,305 --> 02:03:31,006
NOELLE: That is true. I'm actually trying to talk
about something else here, for the first time

1769
02:03:31,006 --> 02:03:32,606
ever.

1770
02:03:32,606 --> 02:03:36,585
MOLLY: In the form of six or maybe seven grubby
children. Our history keeps coming back to us.

1771
02:03:36,585 --> 02:03:41,429
NOELLE: This is specific to our backstory and not
the other fairytale characters on this cruise's

1772
02:03:41,429 --> 02:03:44,976
backstory and that is convenient because I have
read up on it--

1773
02:03:44,976 --> 02:03:46,435
MOLLY: What do you need to tell me?

1774
02:03:46,435 --> 02:03:52,630
NOELLE: The Beast is not telling the whole truth.
He was surprised by the fact that his wife was

1775
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:54,509
sleeping with the Beast, but he--

1776
02:03:54,509 --> 02:03:55,903
MOLLY: Captain Hook?

1777
02:03:55,903 --> 02:03:59,206
NOELLE: That is what I meant.

1778
02:03:59,206 --> 02:04:02,212
MOLLY: I know it's hard for you to imagine Captain
Hook with other people.

1779
02:04:02,212 --> 02:04:08,046
NOELLE: I don't like that. I don't care for that,
okay? I really don't like it when people pay

1780
02:04:08,046 --> 02:04:13,426
attention to people who aren't me, but it's not
about that. I'm saying he knows and he's going to

1781
02:04:13,426 --> 02:04:21,143
do something bad and I think he wants to go to
Pleasure Island to do it. And he didn't know about

1782
02:04:21,143 --> 02:04:24,796
the affair, but he knew other stuff. I don't think
he's up to anything good and we should be ready.

1783
02:04:24,796 --> 02:04:27,750
MOLLY: But why would he be trying to get us
specifically?

1784
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:31,542
NOELLE: Maybe he's not! Maybe we're just on his
ship, but--

1785
02:04:31,542 --> 02:04:35,103
MOLLY: I really like the idea of pleasure islands.
It's something in the name. I don't know what it

1786
02:04:35,103 --> 02:04:37,422
is, it just sounds good.

1787
02:04:37,422 --> 02:04:40,310
YURI: Guys, what you need here, I think you have a
lot to work out with each other. I just want you

1788
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:42,096
to know that I'm a licensed therapist.

1789
02:04:42,096 --> 02:04:44,264
(laughter)

1790
02:04:44,264 --> 02:04:46,372
YURI: And I would be happy, at any point--

1791
02:04:46,372 --> 02:04:51,635
NOELLE: She's always doing this! She's always
saying these things to me. It makes me feel bad.

1792
02:04:51,635 --> 02:04:57,244
YURI: Peter, I think you just need a talk on even
terms, in the same room, together. I think we can

1793
02:04:57,244 --> 02:04:59,262
work through this, maybe on Pleasure Island.

1794
02:04:59,262 --> 02:05:06,292
NOELLE: I think that we should not go to Pleasure
Island. As much as I love pleasure and also

1795
02:05:06,292 --> 02:05:07,980
islands--

1796
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:14,905
AMY: Might I jump in here and say, you came from a land
called Neverland. But Pleasure Island might also

1797
02:05:15,111 --> 02:05:21,169
be named Alwaysland. So you had a shitty
experience another place, perhaps a differently

1798
02:05:21,169 --> 02:05:25,162
named place might have a different experience for
you?

1799
02:05:25,162 --> 02:05:27,578
YURI: She's clearly a therapist, too!

1800
02:05:27,578 --> 02:05:33,009
STEFANIE: Goldilocks goes for a popcorn maker and
maybe some other drinks on the ship just to watch.

1801
02:05:33,009 --> 02:05:38,624
H MICHAEL: I unstitch a pouch that I keep on my
belly, which is where I store my ten days' worth

1802
02:05:38,624 --> 02:05:44,217
of rations that I carry with me. I go, it's kind
of covered in moldy old straw, but if you guys are

1803
02:05:44,217 --> 02:05:46,073
hungry, I got all these rations--

1804
02:05:46,073 --> 02:05:47,507
STEFANIE: Do you have popcorn?

1805
02:05:47,507 --> 02:05:48,775
H MICHAEL: Yeah!

1806
02:05:48,775 --> 02:05:50,295
STEFANIE: I go and sit next to him.

1807
02:05:50,295 --> 02:05:51,939
SAM: So as you all sit down to dine in this--

1808
02:05:51,939 --> 02:05:53,185
H MICHAEL: Out of my stomach.

1809
02:05:53,185 --> 02:05:57,927
SAM: Yes. As he's feeding-- the Beast is taking a
rest in the captain's quarters. You guys are all

1810
02:05:57,927 --> 02:06:04,492
on deck with the boys. Scarecrow's pulling food
out of his chest and feeding it to you and to the

1811
02:06:04,492 --> 02:06:09,881
boys. Everyone's taking a nice break and relaxing,
the sun slowly setting in the horizon. You guys

1812
02:06:09,881 --> 02:06:15,588
have figured out the general direction of where to
go, using the bits of maps and also Beast's

1813
02:06:15,588 --> 02:06:21,118
knowledge of the seas and being there before. He
said before he took a nap that it would take ten

1814
02:06:21,118 --> 02:06:29,080
or 12 hours to get there. So as night fades on the
ship, we're going to take a quick break and we'll

1815
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:32,881
be back in a few minutes. Stay tuned at the break
for-- yes?

1816
02:06:32,881 --> 02:06:36,017
NOELLE: I want to go lie down next to the Beast to
take my nap there.

1817
02:06:36,017 --> 02:06:43,174
SAM: Okay. Great! Stay tuned in the break. There's
going to be a giveaway, so watch that. You guys

1818
02:06:43,174 --> 02:06:46,171
will go outside and have a little beverage or
whatever. We'll be back in five or ten minutes

1819
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:49,336
with more fun on the high seas. Hurray!

1820
02:06:49,336 --> 02:06:52,314
(cheers and applause)

1821
02:06:52,314 --> 02:23:54,061
[break]

1822
02:23:54,061 --> 02:23:57,386
SAM: That's our show, everybody! Thanks for
joining us!

1823
02:23:57,386 --> 02:24:01,090
AMY: I liked it when H died epically, you know?
Like, sacrificed?

1824
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:02,980
NOELLE: It was really tragic.

1825
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:04,971
H MICHAEL: I thought it was powerful, story-wise.

1826
02:24:04,971 --> 02:24:07,479
NOELLE: I'm so glad we got to be there for that.

1827
02:24:07,479 --> 02:24:12,073
SAM: And that everyone got to see it. Welcome back
to the second half of the show! I'm Sam Riegel,

1828
02:24:12,073 --> 02:24:19,162
your host for this special Critical Role one-shot
with fabulously funny guests. Keep in mind,

1829
02:24:19,162 --> 02:24:23,641
tonight, our sponsor is Star Wars: Battlefront II,
available tomorrow on all sorts of platforms.

1830
02:24:23,641 --> 02:24:32,464
There was a winner in chat. SenzuEffect is the
winner. Congratulations, SenzuEffect!

1831
02:24:32,464 --> 02:24:35,802
YURI: That is literally the Senzu Effect, is to
win while in the chat room!

1832
02:24:35,802 --> 02:24:46,025
SAM: You won, I don't know what kind, but one of
these things. Yeah. Wyrmwood.

1833
02:24:46,025 --> 02:24:49,082
H MICHAEL: These are nice craftsmanship. They got
a little magnetic thing. I like that.

1834
02:24:49,082 --> 02:24:51,418
YURI: I didn't even realize these were in here!

1835
02:24:51,418 --> 02:24:53,361
SAM: What have you been using?

1836
02:24:53,361 --> 02:24:55,922
YURI: I didn't know to open these things!

1837
02:24:55,922 --> 02:24:57,880
SAM: Yeah, they know.

1838
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:02,963
YURI: Guys, this is not part of the thing! I
literally was like, oh look, and then there's

1839
02:25:02,963 --> 02:25:04,425
stuff in here.

1840
02:25:04,425 --> 02:25:13,161
SAM: Wyrmwood Gaming. Okay. As we last left, you
were on the Jolly Roger ship, sailing into the

1841
02:25:13,161 --> 02:25:20,927
horizon, looking for Pleasure Island. You had just
faced a gang of pirate children, The Lost Boys.

1842
02:25:20,927 --> 02:25:29,931
Defeated and restrained them. You were eating some
food out of Scarecrow's chest, resting, as the sun

1843
02:25:29,931 --> 02:25:36,172
faded into nighttime. The stars peeking through
the clouds overhead are just enough to keep the

1844
02:25:36,172 --> 02:25:42,070
ship on its path to Pleasure Island. An hour goes
by, two. A sense of boredom eventually creeps over

1845
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:50,166
the ship. Finally, the Beast has risen from his
nap and addresses you all, and says, "Friends,

1846
02:25:50,166 --> 02:25:57,187
"please. I must apologize for how I behaved
earlier. It came as a shock to me to find out that

1847
02:25:57,187 --> 02:26:04,765
"my wife was dead, and that she was cheating on me
with Captain Hook. So I took a hit, but I'm okay

1848
02:26:04,765 --> 02:26:09,149
"now. I appreciate you all being there for me."

1849
02:26:09,149 --> 02:26:16,039
MOLLY: I mean, you're allowed to still be sad for
a bit. It was a short rest.

1850
02:26:16,039 --> 02:26:18,760
SAM: "I'm not a hundo percent yet."

1851
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:23,937
AMY: May I advise you not to jump right back into
a relationship?

1852
02:26:23,937 --> 02:26:25,453
SAM: "Are you--?"

1853
02:26:25,453 --> 02:26:33,848
H MICHAEL: You got a little Scottish in your
ancestry, there, don't you, Queen of Hearts?

1854
02:26:33,848 --> 02:26:39,987
SAM: "May I ask you all a rather strange
question?"

1855
02:26:39,987 --> 02:26:43,434
YURI: Yes, please! I love the strange questions!

1856
02:26:43,434 --> 02:26:52,571
SAM: "Will you humor me? I'm having doubts,
everyone. I'm starting to think that love is a

1857
02:26:52,571 --> 02:26:56,811
"lie. I could use a little bit of a boost."

1858
02:26:56,811 --> 02:26:58,495
YURI: Like a hand job?

1859
02:26:58,495 --> 02:27:00,130
SAM: "No, not like a hand job."

1860
02:27:00,130 --> 02:27:01,872
YURI: I have Mage Hand.

1861
02:27:01,872 --> 02:27:04,597
MOLLY: I also have Mage Hand.

1862
02:27:04,597 --> 02:27:10,111
SAM: "I have two dicks! This is great!"

1863
02:27:10,111 --> 02:27:12,818
H MICHAEL: You could literally tear a seam and
fuck me anywhere.

1864
02:27:12,818 --> 02:27:14,691
SAM: Oh, god.

1865
02:27:14,691 --> 02:27:19,460
H MICHAEL: I'm not saying you're allowed to. I'm
just saying it's an option.

1866
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:22,119
YURI: Consent, consent.

1867
02:27:22,119 --> 02:27:28,551
SAM: "While we sail to Pleasure Island, before we
take our rest for the evening, could you please

1868
02:27:28,551 --> 02:27:34,014
"help me pass the time and get my mind off of
things by proving me wrong? By proving that love

1869
02:27:34,014 --> 02:27:39,834
"still does have a chance? Back on the S.S. Public
Domain right about now, we would all be playing

1870
02:27:39,834 --> 02:27:47,585
"this silly dating quiz game that I invented. It
would warm my heart if you would let me guide you

1871
02:27:47,585 --> 02:27:50,246
"through it here. Give me a sense of normalcy."

1872
02:27:50,246 --> 02:27:54,303
MOLLY: I don't think a bunch of people from a
singles cruise are the right people to show you

1873
02:27:54,303 --> 02:27:55,741
that love is true.

1874
02:27:55,741 --> 02:27:57,793
STEFANIE: Yeah, we came here because we believed
in you.

1875
02:27:57,793 --> 02:28:06,553
NOELLE: I disagree. I feel so much love. I feel
like I would be in love with any of these people

1876
02:28:06,553 --> 02:28:11,585
right now. I am so ready to play your game, Beast.
I stroke his arm a little bit. I want to start,

1877
02:28:11,585 --> 02:28:14,075
you know, soothing the Beast a little bit.

1878
02:28:14,075 --> 02:28:19,109
SAM: The Beast definitely responds to the petting
and gives you a little bit of a purr and says,

1879
02:28:19,109 --> 02:28:20,808
"Thank you for understanding."

1880
02:28:20,808 --> 02:28:23,968
NOELLE: You've got to let go, man. You've had a
hard day. I scritch behind his ears a little bit.

1881
02:28:23,968 --> 02:28:28,953
Yeah, that's right, buddy, it's okay. You're among
friends now.

1882
02:28:28,953 --> 02:28:31,197
STEFANIE: Do you just flirt with everybody?

1883
02:28:31,197 --> 02:28:39,523
NOELLE: Look, we're on the high seas. Who knows
what tomorrow might bring? YOLO, man.

1884
02:28:39,523 --> 02:28:42,623
STEFANIE: Hey, that was my phrase when I wanted to
start-- okay!

1885
02:28:42,623 --> 02:28:44,054
YURI: The S.S. YOLO.

1886
02:28:44,054 --> 02:28:49,897
NOELLE: And yes, I do flirt with everybody, so
come on. Enough with the judgment. I keep

1887
02:28:49,897 --> 02:28:52,583
scritching, while making eye contact.

1888
02:28:52,583 --> 02:28:57,089
SAM: "I love this. I could feel this all night.
This is really good. But what do you say? Just to

1889
02:28:57,089 --> 02:28:58,455
"pass the time?"

1890
02:28:58,455 --> 02:29:00,152
H MICHAEL: I'm into the quiz.

1891
02:29:00,152 --> 02:29:04,928
SAM: "All right, here's the rules. I'll ask a
question about one of the ladies, which the

1892
02:29:04,928 --> 02:29:08,426
"gentlemen-- Peter Pan, I'm including you in that--
can buzz in to answer."

1893
02:29:08,426 --> 02:29:10,036
NOELLE: You know, I'll go either way.

1894
02:29:10,036 --> 02:29:13,200
SAM: "Then I'll switch and ask the ladies a
question about the men. Points will be awarded.

1895
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:20,386
"The winner gets to pick a companion to spend seven
minutes in heaven with, in the romance lounge--

1896
02:29:20,386 --> 02:29:27,922
"oh, we don't have that on this ship. In the
galley. We'll say, in the galley of the ship. Yes."

1897
02:29:27,922 --> 02:29:29,754
MOLLY: That's very heterosexual.

1898
02:29:29,754 --> 02:29:31,627
SAM: "So, are you ready to play?"

1899
02:29:31,627 --> 02:29:32,925
YURI: It doesn't have to be.

1900
02:29:32,925 --> 02:29:35,425
MOLLY: I guess you could choose anyone.

1901
02:29:35,425 --> 02:29:39,802
H MICHAEL: I have two options who are male right
now.

1902
02:29:39,802 --> 02:29:46,980
SAM: "We'll see if you win the quiz, first, before
we get into your gender preference. And we are

1903
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:51,967
"gender blind on this cruise line. Anything goes,
right?"

1904
02:29:51,967 --> 02:29:54,875
MOLLY: Very bisexual situation going on.

1905
02:29:54,875 --> 02:29:56,464
SAM: "Sure. Species, whatever."

1906
02:29:56,464 --> 02:29:59,177
NOELLE: I prefer to think of myself as
Pan-sexual.

1907
02:29:59,177 --> 02:30:02,284
YURI: Everybody, good night, thank you.

1908
02:30:02,284 --> 02:30:05,021
MOLLY: What he means is he only loves himself.

1909
02:30:05,021 --> 02:30:06,904
NOELLE: That is also true.

1910
02:30:06,904 --> 02:30:13,293
SAM: I'm going to give you an inspiration die
bonus for that. On your next roll, you can add a

1911
02:30:13,293 --> 02:30:22,340
d6 to your next roll. Puns will be rewarded. All
right. "Men! Gentlemen! That's the Hatter,

1912
02:30:22,340 --> 02:30:23,240
"Peter--"

1913
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:25,070
NOELLE: Call me "Peter Pun!" Sorry.

1914
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:33,030
SAM: I'm going to take away that die. And it's
gone. "Scarecrow. Based on your previous answers,

1915
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:38,805
"which lady described her last relationship as a
'summer fling with a mermaid'? Anyone care to buzz

1916
02:30:38,805 --> 02:30:43,008
"in? Only the men can buzz in. One of the men?"

1917
02:30:43,008 --> 02:30:47,126
NOELLE: Oh, Wendy! She fucked a mermaid while we
were still dating! It was really, really

1918
02:30:47,126 --> 02:30:48,542
heartbreaking for me!

1919
02:30:48,542 --> 02:30:49,946
SAM: "Correct! One point for Peter Pan!"

1920
02:30:49,946 --> 02:30:51,386
MOLLY: I love mermaids. What can I say?

1921
02:30:51,386 --> 02:30:53,877
NOELLE: I also love mermaids, but only I am
allowed to date the mermaids.

1922
02:30:53,877 --> 02:30:57,208
AMY: Are there any small mer-men?

1923
02:30:57,208 --> 02:31:07,030
MOLLY: All of the men are actually very small, and
they attach to their sides. Wendy looks over the

1924
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:09,629
side of the boat to see if she can spot any
mermaids.

1925
02:31:09,629 --> 02:31:18,409
SAM: "Wendy! Goldie! Queenie! This question is for
you. Someone buzz in. Which gentleman listed as

1926
02:31:18,409 --> 02:31:24,732
"his pet peeve, 'clocks?' Goldie buzzed in first."

1927
02:31:24,732 --> 02:31:26,334
STEFANIE: I'd say Hatter.

1928
02:31:26,334 --> 02:31:33,345
SAM: "Correct! One point for Goldilocks! Men! The
question was, 'Where's the strangest place you've

1929
02:31:33,345 --> 02:31:38,042
"'ever made love?' Her answer was, 'In some random
guy's house in the woods, because breaking and

1930
02:31:38,042 --> 02:31:40,596
"'entering is hot.' Peter buzzed in first."

1931
02:31:40,596 --> 02:31:43,485
NOELLE: Did I? Okay.

1932
02:31:43,485 --> 02:31:45,118
SAM: Well, you hit something first.

1933
02:31:45,118 --> 02:31:48,489
NOELLE: I did, I hit something. Yeah. Goldilocks,
I think, loves breaking and entering.

1934
02:31:48,489 --> 02:31:53,880
SAM: "Correct! Peter Pan, with two points. Ladies!
Which fella says that he 'only ever wears some

1935
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:56,113
"'leaves to bed?' Wendy?"

1936
02:31:56,113 --> 02:32:00,649
MOLLY: I mean, we all know it's Peter. We know.
It's obvious.

1937
02:32:00,649 --> 02:32:05,804
SAM: "Correct! Men, which lady fantasizes about
marrying a man so she can own more land?

1938
02:32:05,804 --> 02:32:07,910
"Scarecrow?"

1939
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,895
H MICHAEL: The queen of my dick.

1940
02:32:09,895 --> 02:32:11,495
SAM: "Correct."

1941
02:32:11,495 --> 02:32:14,363
AMY: I hope that you actually said that.

1942
02:32:14,363 --> 02:32:22,632
SAM: "Ladies, which bachelor said his goal was 'to
find a monogamous relationship, but only

1943
02:32:22,632 --> 02:32:25,298
"'monogamous for them, not for me?'"

1944
02:32:25,298 --> 02:32:28,461
MOLLY: I mean, that's Peter.

1945
02:32:28,461 --> 02:32:32,381
SAM: "Peter Pan again! You seem to know Peter very
well."

1946
02:32:32,381 --> 02:32:34,803
MOLLY: Yes, this person, very well.

1947
02:32:34,803 --> 02:32:37,595
SAM: "Wow. Maybe there's more to explore there!"

1948
02:32:37,595 --> 02:32:39,366
MOLLY: The thing is, if it only-- whatever.

1949
02:32:39,366 --> 02:32:46,642
SAM: "Men, which lady described her sex life as
'not hold, not cold, just tepid?' Hatter?"

1950
02:32:46,642 --> 02:32:48,625
YURI: That would be Goldilocks again.

1951
02:32:48,625 --> 02:32:55,760
SAM: "Correct! We've got the Scarecrow with two
points, right? No. One point. Shit."

1952
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:02,329
YURI: The Hatter with seven points!

1953
02:33:02,329 --> 02:33:06,601
SAM: Peter's got two points? Wendy's got two?
Shit, I've miscounted the points! Fuck it!

1954
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:09,876
H MICHAEL: Wendy's got two. Wendy and Peter won.

1955
02:33:09,876 --> 02:33:14,898
SAM: "Couple more questions. Women, which
gentleman said his last relationship was being

1956
02:33:14,898 --> 02:33:16,984
"married to an ocelot?"

1957
02:33:16,984 --> 02:33:24,206
STEFANIE: The ocelot? This one! That one!

1958

SAM: "Incorrect! You lose a point, Goldilocks. An
ocelot, until he found out his spouse was cheating

1959

"on him with a shark."

1960
02:33:33,322 --> 02:33:34,871
AMY: Oh, Peter Pan!

1961
02:33:34,871 --> 02:33:39,718
SAM: "Incorrect! Yes, Goldie?"

1962
02:33:39,718 --> 02:33:41,240
STEFANIE: Hatter.

1963
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:50,182
SAM: "Correct, you got a point back. Fellas, which
lady's ideal mate is someone magical, or several

1964
02:33:50,182 --> 02:33:52,193
"magical someones at the same time?"

1965
02:33:52,193 --> 02:33:53,665
NOELLE: Ooh!

1966
02:33:53,665 --> 02:33:59,943
SAM: "Wendy, you are on fire. Wendy's into the
kinky shit."

1967
02:33:59,943 --> 02:34:06,207
NOELLE: Because I came home several times, in my
leaf bed, there was stuff happening, and it was

1968
02:34:06,207 --> 02:34:07,645
choptastic.

Goldie?"

STEFANIE: I think it's Scarecrow.

SAM: "Correct. Scarecrow."

1974
02:34:31,424 --> 02:34:35,982
H MICHAEL: Even though I'm not going to win this,
I feel like I just won.

1975
02:34:35,982 --> 02:34:38,482
YURI: I feel like you just did, too.

SAM: "Boys, which girl's ideal mate is 'a small
man?'"

H MICHAEL: It's the queen of my balls!

1978
02:34:47,276 --> 02:34:55,976
SAM: "And finally, ladies, which gentleman goes to
sleep wearing a wooden pole up his ass?"

1979
02:34:55,976 --> 02:34:59,978
AMY: The crazy Hatter?

1980
02:34:59,978 --> 02:35:03,936
STEFANIE: No! Wait, no, no! I've got it!

1981
02:35:03,936 --> 02:35:05,427
SAM: "Goldie?"

1982
02:35:05,427 --> 02:35:06,685
STEFANIE: Scarecrow!

1983
02:35:06,685 --> 02:35:07,831
SAM: "Scarecrow."

1984
02:35:07,831 --> 02:35:09,536
AMY: I'm so out of it!

1985
02:35:09,536 --> 02:35:13,864
YURI: I feel like I won because you thought I was
that cool!

1986
02:35:13,864 --> 02:35:22,828
STEFANIE: Was that your ideal? We've gotta keep
talking about those fetishes. I think I won, or at

1987
02:35:22,828 --> 02:35:24,910
least tied for two or three.

1988
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:31,514
SAM: "Wendy Darling is the winner of our quiz. At
least, that's what I wrote down! Got lost in the

you like to pick different partners to go with you?"

STEFANIE: Wait, there's only one galley! Right?

1992
02:35:51,932 --> 02:35:56,506
SAM: "There's an ice room in the back that they
can also use."

1993
02:35:56,506 --> 02:35:59,786
NOELLE: So wait, each of us gets to pick anyone
here?

1994
02:35:59,786 --> 02:36:01,263
SAM: "How many points did you have?"

1995
02:36:01,263 --> 02:36:02,588
NOELLE: Three.

1996
02:36:02,588 --> 02:36:06,137
SAM: "Okay, you both tied. So if you'd like to,
I'll let the lady go first. Wendy, you can pick a

1997
02:36:06,137 --> 02:36:09,274
"mate to ask to join you. They do not have to say
yes."

1998
02:36:09,274 --> 02:36:11,820
MOLLY: Come on, I think we've got some stuff to
talk about.

1999
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,569
NOELLE: Yeah, we got some stuff to talk about.

2000
02:36:13,569 --> 02:36:15,398
YURI: I think you should bring your therapist.

2001
02:36:15,398 --> 02:36:19,162
NOELLE: You want to bring our therapist? He should
join us. You want to join us?

2002
02:36:19,162 --> 02:36:26,213
SAM: All right, the Beast escorts you to the
galley, a candle-lit kitchen with sticky floors

2003
02:36:26,213 --> 02:36:33,686
that smells of rotten milk. In no world would it
ever be romantic. There are pots hanging from the

2004
02:36:33,686 --> 02:36:37,720
ceilings, grease stains on the walls. He leaves
you there in peace.

2005
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:43,804
NOELLE: I sweep all of the bottles and cans off
the table with my arm.

2006
02:36:43,804 --> 02:36:45,060
MOLLY: Our therapist is here!

2007
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:46,556
SAM: Wait, the Hatter's with you?

2008
02:36:46,556 --> 02:36:48,085
NOELLE: Yeah, we brought him with.

2009
02:36:48,085 --> 02:36:50,822
SAM: Okay, there's a little man standing in the
corner watching you.

2010
02:36:50,822 --> 02:36:58,425
NOELLE: I just cleared them. I don't do anything
after that, I just clear them. Okay. I clear them

2011
02:36:58,425 --> 02:37:00,485
just in case, you know.

2012
02:37:00,485 --> 02:37:04,827
YURI: Peter, why don't you begin? Why don't you
tell us how you're feeling?

2013
02:37:04,827 --> 02:37:13,047
NOELLE: I'm feeling, number one, really scared of
going to Pleasure Island, because I still don't

2014
02:37:13,047 --> 02:37:20,021
trust the Beast. I am scared of letting myself
feel pleasure because of what that might mean.

2015
02:37:20,021 --> 02:37:22,019
Like, what do you think that says about me?

2016
02:37:22,019 --> 02:37:24,016
YURI: How does that make you feel, Wendy?

2017
02:37:24,016 --> 02:37:30,438
MOLLY: I think you're all wrapped up in your own
thing. Think about someone else for one minute.

2018
02:37:30,438 --> 02:37:32,180
All the rest of us want to go to Pleasure Island.

2019
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:38,900
NOELLE: I think that this all has something to do
with my core wound. I think that I really, not

2020
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:51,407
having a mother, need some stability in my life,
you know? And you took that away from me. What the hell?

2021
02:37:51,407 --> 02:37:55,587
YURI: Did Wendy take that away from you, or did
you take that away from yourself?

2022
02:37:55,587 --> 02:37:57,268
MOLLY: That one. No. That one.

2023
02:37:57,268 --> 02:37:58,899
NOELLE: Wendy was the one who did it.

2024
02:37:58,899 --> 02:38:00,192
MOLLY: No, listen to our therapist.

2025
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:02,327
NOELLE: Well, he said both things. He didn't just
say one thing. He said both things, and I chose one.

2026
02:38:02,327 --> 02:38:08,296
MOLLY: But always, when they say two things in
that way, the second thing is always the right

2027
02:38:08,296 --> 02:38:09,388
answer.

2028
02:38:09,388 --> 02:38:12,594
NOELLE: Is that true? This is the first time I've
done therapy. When do you get to sleep with the

2029
02:38:12,594 --> 02:38:14,179
therapist? I don't understand.

2030
02:38:14,179 --> 02:38:19,069
YURI: You'll get to sleep with the therapist in
minute six of our seven minutes in heaven. Don't

2031
02:38:19,069 --> 02:38:20,191
worry.

2032
02:38:20,191 --> 02:38:22,262
NOELLE: Oh, how many minutes in are we? Are we
rolling initiative right now?

2033
02:38:22,262 --> 02:38:28,879
MOLLY: I wish that you would grow up a little bit,
because we have so much past and we have such good

2034
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:32,734
chemistry, and we could have a really lovely
relationship, but you always act like a child.

2035
02:38:32,734 --> 02:38:37,524
H MICHAEL: Outside the door, I've taken a piece of
straw and I've slipped it in the door, and I've

2036
02:38:37,524 --> 02:38:42,507
frilled out the end of it to create a little
speaker phone, and I've invited the two ladies to

2037
02:38:42,507 --> 02:38:44,927
lean in and listen in.

2038
02:38:44,927 --> 02:38:49,071
SAM: Beast is also there.

2039
02:38:49,071 --> 02:38:51,953
AMY: I think they're fucking!

2040
02:38:51,953 --> 02:39:00,830
SAM: Beast knocks on the door and says, "All
right! Six minutes left!"

2041
02:39:00,830 --> 02:39:07,677
NOELLE: We could have sex like 13 times right
now!

2042
02:39:07,677 --> 02:39:11,597
SAM: "Just kidding, one minute left! Try to wrap
it up!"

2043
02:39:11,597 --> 02:39:16,345
NOELLE: Oh okay, wow, I've got to fit 13 times
into one minute.

2044
02:39:16,345 --> 02:39:22,996
YURI: But okay, guys, we could either spend our
last minute fucking, or we could try to deal with

2045
02:39:22,996 --> 02:39:25,065
your problems at the core.

2046
02:39:25,065 --> 02:39:27,098
NOELLE: I grab the Hatter and I kiss him on the
mouth.

2047
02:39:27,098 --> 02:39:28,575
SAM: Oh! Do you resist?

2048
02:39:28,575 --> 02:39:30,269
YURI: (snorts) No!

2049
02:39:30,269 --> 02:39:31,924
SAM: All right. The kiss is long.

2050
02:39:31,924 --> 02:39:35,081
NOELLE: Wendy, this is what you've done to me! And
I kiss him again.

2051
02:39:35,081 --> 02:39:43,250
SAM: The waifish Peter Pan grabs the tiny,
weird-looking halfling, Hatter, and plants a long,

2052
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:49,946
hard kiss on him. He does not resist. Instead, he
wraps his arms around Peter's waist and brings him

2053
02:39:49,946 --> 02:39:56,812
in closer. Tongues are slipped. It goes on for an
uncomfortable 12 seconds and then breaks.

2054
02:39:56,812 --> 02:40:01,205
YURI: Wendy, how does that make you feel?

2055
02:40:01,205 --> 02:40:09,554
MOLLY: Like, slightly aroused in a weird way that
I don't maybe want to address. Yeah, fuck it. And

2056
02:40:09,554 --> 02:40:11,372
I kiss the Hatter as well.

2057
02:40:11,372 --> 02:40:12,582
SAM: Oh! Do you resist?

2058
02:40:12,582 --> 02:40:13,845
YURI: No!

2059
02:40:13,845 --> 02:40:22,108
SAM: All right! Another equally long kiss.
Descends into some light necking and ear-nibbling.

2060
02:40:22,108 --> 02:40:26,021
Wendy is taller than the Hatter, so she has to
scoop down to get to him.

2061
02:40:26,021 --> 02:40:31,407
H MICHAEL: Listening in, I go, I'm just going to
put it out there. Should we also all be making out?

2062
02:40:31,407 --> 02:40:35,002
AMY: I grapple him.

2063
02:40:35,002 --> 02:40:39,371
SAM: Grapple him? Okay. Roll an attack.

2064
02:40:39,371 --> 02:40:45,985
AMY: Okay, and I have a feat that makes me-- I can
restrain you if I'm grappling you.

2065
02:40:45,985 --> 02:40:50,680
H MICHAEL: As she does this, I go, I'm just posing
a question!

2066
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:53,691
AMY: Okay, not bad. A 12.

2067
02:40:53,691 --> 02:40:56,362
SAM: Roll a strength save.

2068
02:40:56,362 --> 02:41:01,298
H MICHAEL: Okay, strength save? Three.

2069
02:41:01,298 --> 02:41:04,922
SAM: No, you definitely grab him and can do with
him as you please.

2070
02:41:04,922 --> 02:41:13,926
AMY: Okay, so he said, "Should we all be making
out?" And I am, I think, a little thirsty, so I

2071
02:41:13,926 --> 02:41:29,574
basically take my big, muscly arm and I almost
clothesline him. It's like this, ka-kunk! And I

2072
02:41:29,574 --> 02:41:39,128
awkwardly place myself on top of him and that's
what it is. I'm not very experienced in this.

2073
02:41:39,128 --> 02:41:46,404
H MICHAEL: I go, hold on, hold on! I gather up
some fabric and I tie it off with a bit of twine

2074
02:41:46,404 --> 02:41:50,692
to create sort of a phallus.

2075
02:41:50,692 --> 02:41:52,897
SAM: Yeah, because he's just straw. There's
nothing down there.

2076
02:41:52,897 --> 02:41:54,681
H MICHAEL: I gather it up.

2077
02:41:54,681 --> 02:42:01,513
STEFANIE: Okay, Goldilocks turns to Beast and
says, is this what you wanted?

2078
02:42:01,513 --> 02:42:05,350
SAM: "No! No, this is not what I wanted! This is
an exploration of love! Please, please, we don't--"

2079
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:08,225
AMY: I look as scared as this.

2080
02:42:08,225 --> 02:42:13,174
SAM: "Queen, I admire your romantic instincts, but
this is not the time or place to--"

2081
02:42:13,174 --> 02:42:15,063
H MICHAEL: What are you doing, man?!

2082
02:42:15,063 --> 02:42:20,976
SAM: "I'm uncomfortable! There's other people in
the room! I'm trying to create a safe space here."

2083
02:42:20,976 --> 02:42:23,057
AMY: Oh, I'm so sorry!

2084
02:42:23,057 --> 02:42:26,602
SAM: "If you guys want to pursue this, I'm not
going to stop you, but please find a stateroom

2085
02:42:26,602 --> 02:42:29,474
"somewhere to do this in private. Please."

2086
02:42:29,474 --> 02:42:31,338
AMY: This isn't what you meant?

2087
02:42:31,338 --> 02:42:34,555
H MICHAEL: I'm <i>so</i> on board.

2088
02:42:34,555 --> 02:42:41,724
SAM: "Why don't you retire? You guys can take the
captain's quarters if you'd like, but not right

2089
02:42:41,724 --> 02:42:47,069
"here. We're at the bottom of a foot of stairs next
to a kitchen, and we're all watching you. It's

2090
02:42:47,069 --> 02:42:48,347
"kind of gross."

2091
02:42:48,347 --> 02:42:54,209
AMY: At that moment, when he gets all intense, I
go, (orgasm sounds), and I roll off him and I have

2092
02:42:54,209 --> 02:42:58,345
a big sigh.

2093
02:42:58,345 --> 02:43:00,759
SAM: "Did you--? Oh boy."

2094
02:43:00,759 --> 02:43:03,140
MOLLY: Not a family show.

2095
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:04,501
SAM: "Oh god."

2096
02:43:04,501 --> 02:43:09,704
H MICHAEL: I give the Beast a look, like, all
right, man. And then I head to the end of the ship.

2097
02:43:09,704 --> 02:43:12,473
SAM: "Sorry. I didn't know, I'm sorry."

2098
02:43:12,473 --> 02:43:18,827
H MICHAEL: No no, hey, I hope that really renewed
your belief in love. Is that what you were looking for?

2099
02:43:18,827 --> 02:43:23,315
SAM: "I was, but that did not come anywhere close
to renewing."

2100
02:43:23,315 --> 02:43:28,524
H MICHAEL: And then I go, <i>I'm glad.</i> And then I
book it.

2101
02:43:28,524 --> 02:43:30,807
SAM: The Beast starts crying again.

2102
02:43:30,807 --> 02:43:32,664
YURI: It did come close, though.

2103
02:43:32,664 --> 02:43:37,336
SAM: "All right, well, thank you for humoring me,
I guess."

2104
02:43:37,336 --> 02:43:39,992
NOELLE: Are we still in heaven?

2105
02:43:39,992 --> 02:43:43,655
SAM: Yeah, you're still in the galley. Actually,
if you all, everyone in the galley, can you roll a

2106
02:43:43,655 --> 02:43:45,219
perception check real quick?

2107
02:43:45,219 --> 02:43:53,544
MOLLY: Okay. Six.

2108
02:43:53,544 --> 02:43:54,903
NOELLE: 15.

2109
02:43:54,903 --> 02:43:56,027
YURI: Six.

2110
02:43:56,027 --> 02:43:59,790
NOELLE: I'm watching them making out.

2111
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:04,009
SAM: As you watch them make out, you notice behind
them there is something up on a shelf that was too

2112
02:44:04,009 --> 02:44:12,937
high for the Lost Boys to find. It seems like a
little vial of potion or something. You grab it down.

2113
02:44:12,937 --> 02:44:18,848
MOLLY: So when you do that, I sort of push the
Hatter off me and I'm like, This is like, you're

2114
02:44:18,848 --> 02:44:24,929
always distracted. I don't know. If it's not about
you, you can't be engaged with anything.

2115
02:44:24,929 --> 02:44:31,863
NOELLE: Hey, I was just looking around! I found
some-- And I want to palm this potion and then

2116
02:44:31,863 --> 02:44:35,995
reach for the next thing on the shelf and be like,
Fruit Loops! I found some Fruit Loops! I got

2117
02:44:35,995 --> 02:44:40,358
hungry, okay? You guys were making out for so
long. Look, I don't know how to cook for myself. I

2118
02:44:40,358 --> 02:44:42,092
need Fruit Loops.

2119
02:44:42,092 --> 02:44:48,312
SAM: Wendy, as you see the box of stale cereal,
you also see something tucked behind it, a little

2120
02:44:48,312 --> 02:44:51,279
bit shiny. You have this item now.

2121
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:53,997
MOLLY: Okay, well, I'm taking this thing.

2122
02:44:53,997 --> 02:44:55,652
NOELLE: Oh, all right, whatever.

2123
02:44:55,652 --> 02:44:57,533
MOLLY: I grab a whole sword.

2124
02:44:57,533 --> 02:44:59,388
NOELLE: (gasps) I want a sword!

2125
02:44:59,388 --> 02:45:02,005
SAM: Yep. Feel free to use it whenever.

2126
02:45:02,005 --> 02:45:04,158
NOELLE: I reach out to the shelf again to see if
there's anything else up there.

2127
02:45:04,158 --> 02:45:05,989
MOLLY: I look at the sword. Does it do anything?

2128
02:45:05,989 --> 02:45:11,352
SAM: If you would like to, you can try to use it
for something. Sure. You get this too.

2129
02:45:11,352 --> 02:45:18,259
YURI: I look up on the shelf and I'm taking notes
from our session to make sure, for our next

2130
02:45:18,259 --> 02:45:19,553
session.

2131
02:45:19,553 --> 02:45:23,024
SAM: Okay. Can you read your item, just so we know
what it does?

2132
02:45:23,024 --> 02:45:28,129
MOLLY: Yes. I have a normal longsword, except the
spirit of Amy Vorpahl is inside it and she talks

2133
02:45:28,129 --> 02:45:29,231
to me.

2134
02:45:29,231 --> 02:45:31,896
SAM: It's an Amy Vorpahl sword.

2135
02:45:31,896 --> 02:45:34,366
YURI: That was a long time coming.

2136
02:45:34,366 --> 02:45:47,588
SAM: This sword is just a normal sword, but Amy
Vorpahl talks to you. That's it.

2137
02:45:47,588 --> 02:45:54,490
AMY: Hey man, what's up? I think, you want to be
friends? I think you'll be real cool. We have the

2138
02:45:54,490 --> 02:45:56,694
same haircut.

2139
02:45:56,694 --> 02:45:59,228
MOLLY: Okay. Do you want to make out?

2140
02:45:59,228 --> 02:46:03,392
AMY: Me? I mean, you know me. I'll kiss anything.

2141
02:46:03,392 --> 02:46:07,907
MOLLY: Ow, I cut my lip.

2142
02:46:07,907 --> 02:46:09,784
SAM: Okay, one hit point gone.

2143
02:46:09,784 --> 02:46:11,469
AMY: You're the best.

2144
02:46:11,469 --> 02:46:16,360
MOLLY: I thought that would work out better. I'm
trying to make this asshole jealous. I'll turn you

2145
02:46:16,360 --> 02:46:17,815
so you can see him.

2146
02:46:17,815 --> 02:46:20,809
AMY: Yeah, kissing can be painful sometimes.

2147
02:46:20,809 --> 02:46:24,483
MOLLY: Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes your heart,
sometimes your face.

2148
02:46:24,483 --> 02:46:30,923
SAM: The night stretches on and everyone starts to
feel tired and finds places to curl up for a

2149
02:46:30,923 --> 02:46:36,172
night's slumber. Does anyone else want to do
anything before you guys go to sleep for the night?

2150
02:46:36,172 --> 02:46:38,923
AMY: I'm going to talk to Goldilocks.

2151
02:46:38,923 --> 02:46:42,554
H. MICHAEL: If I get an item of clothing, do I
have to equip it?

2152
02:46:42,554 --> 02:46:45,032
SAM: Yeah, you can put it on.

2153
02:46:45,032 --> 02:46:47,348
H. MICHAEL: I put on my Suspenders of Disbelief.

2154
02:46:47,348 --> 02:46:49,627
NOELLE: When did you get clothing?

2155
02:46:49,627 --> 02:46:54,258
SAM: Suspenders of Disbelief is a thing that I
just made up.

2156
02:46:54,258 --> 02:47:00,371
NOELLE: Isn't that the title of Frank Angones's
Tumblr blog?

2157
02:47:00,371 --> 02:47:01,671
SAM: Is it?

2158
02:47:01,671 --> 02:47:02,677
NOELLE: It actually is.

2159
02:47:02,677 --> 02:47:04,466
SAM: Oh god, I should know that!

2160
02:47:04,466 --> 02:47:08,026
NOELLE: This is a very specific thing between us
and a few other people.

2161
02:47:08,026 --> 02:47:14,876
SAM: So you are now wearing colorful rainbow
suspenders over your burlap sack clothing.

2162
02:47:14,876 --> 02:47:18,597
STEFANIE: Does that mean he believes in love
less?

2163
02:47:18,597 --> 02:47:20,708
SAM: No, you don't know what it does, but he knows
what it does and that's all you need to know.

2164
02:47:20,708 --> 02:47:28,153
AMY: Goldilocks, you seem to have it all figured
out.

2165
02:47:28,153 --> 02:47:29,840
STEFANIE: Excuse me?

2166
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:38,179
AMY: Oh, you know, sometimes I think I'm coming on
a bit intense, and maybe you had some advice for me.

2167
02:47:38,179 --> 02:47:42,242
STEFANIE: Yeah, because you've got a starched
collar, but that's okay, you just need to let your

2168
02:47:42,242 --> 02:47:47,392
hair out. Your crown's already a little wonky.
It's cool, put it to the side, be like, party

2169
02:47:47,392 --> 02:47:51,475
girl, and you'll be okay. You like what you like.

2170
02:47:51,475 --> 02:47:57,492
AMY: I do, but I don't know if it's suiting me
well. I like the tiny men.

2171
02:47:57,492 --> 02:48:02,130
STEFANIE: You know, I say to each their own. If
you know what you love--

2172
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:07,735
AMY: But how can I be more attractive to the small
men?

2173
02:48:07,735 --> 02:48:12,185
SAM: She is really singularly focused.

2174
02:48:12,185 --> 02:48:15,982
STEFANIE: I get it, I get it. There's a lot of
things that you can do.

2175
02:48:15,982 --> 02:48:20,760
AMY: Name one.

2176
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:36,829
STEFANIE: Well, you can play. Flirt. Be willing to
be a wonderful, tall, stately woman that you are,

2177
02:48:36,829 --> 02:48:42,458
and also get down on their level and do whatever
you desire.

2178
02:48:42,458 --> 02:48:44,160
AMY: Boop.

2179
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:53,877
STEFANIE: If you boop me again, I will choke you.
That's my flirting style.

2180
02:48:53,877 --> 02:48:57,335
AMY: Hm, I have a lot to think about. I'm going to
do it--

2181
02:48:57,335 --> 02:49:00,829
SAM: In bed. All right, you all find--

2182
02:49:00,829 --> 02:49:08,438
MOLLY: I put all the Lost Boys to bed. I'm going
to make sure the Queen does not come anywhere near them.

2183
02:49:08,438 --> 02:49:10,363
SAM: Do you read them a bedtime story?

2184
02:49:10,363 --> 02:49:11,861
MOLLY: No, I fucking don't.

2185
02:49:11,861 --> 02:49:13,402
SAM: They're begging for it.

2186
02:49:13,402 --> 02:49:14,531
YURI: I sing them a lullaby.

2187
02:49:14,531 --> 02:49:15,669
SAM: They love you.

2188
02:49:15,669 --> 02:49:17,383
STEFANIE: Because you almost murdered one.

2189
02:49:17,383 --> 02:49:18,565
YURI: Right, I feel bad.

2190
02:49:18,565 --> 02:49:24,007
SAM: "Thank you so much, kind sir! Papa!"

2191
02:49:24,007 --> 02:49:27,902
STEFANIE: I sneak over to the Scarecrow before I
fall asleep.

2192
02:49:27,902 --> 02:49:30,560
SAM: I'm not sure he sleeps.

2193
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:33,764
H. MICHAEL: I'm staring at the ocean.

2194
02:49:33,764 --> 02:49:43,018
STEFANIE: I surreptitiously sneak my hands into
his canteen of food.

2195
02:49:43,018 --> 02:49:45,491
SAM: Okay, roll a sleight of hand check.

2196
02:49:45,491 --> 02:49:48,432
NOELLE: Canteen of food?

2197
02:49:48,432 --> 02:49:52,431
STEFANIE: It's his stomach. It's in his body.

2198
02:49:52,431 --> 02:49:54,681
SAM: Vorps, show her where sleight of hand is.

2199
02:49:54,681 --> 02:50:00,520
STEFANIE: 16 plus... negative one. So 15.

2200
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:07,450
SAM: Okay, roll a perception check. With
advantage, so that means you can roll twice and

2201
02:50:07,450 --> 02:50:09,740
take the better roll, because it's your fucking
chest.

2202
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:14,879
H. MICHAEL: Oh, a 16 plus two. 18.

2203
02:50:14,879 --> 02:50:18,121
SAM: You definitely feel her reaching into your
chest cavity.

2204
02:50:18,121 --> 02:50:20,365
STEFANIE: And I pull out some dark chocolate.

2205
02:50:20,365 --> 02:50:24,840
H. MICHAEL: I feel it, so I grab her hand and go
like, if you want a snack, you're going to have to

2206
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:26,558
go in through the butt.

2207
02:50:26,558 --> 02:50:33,222
STEFANIE: Can I fight him?

2208
02:50:33,222 --> 02:50:39,229
SAM: Can you what? Bite him? Fight? You can attack
him, sure.

2209
02:50:39,229 --> 02:50:41,468
STEFANIE: I'm going to attack him with a Shocking
Grasp.

2210
02:50:41,468 --> 02:50:47,715
SAM: Okay, go ahead and, you have a spell DC? Oh
no, that's a melee attack, because you have to

2211
02:50:47,715 --> 02:50:53,598
touch him. Roll a d20, add your spell attack
modifier. Vorpahl, help her.

2212
02:50:53,598 --> 02:50:56,686
STEFANIE: It's a 14 plus three, so I'm at 17.

2213
02:50:56,686 --> 02:50:58,841
SAM: His AC is lower than that. Yes, you
definitely hit.

2214
02:50:58,841 --> 02:51:00,955
STEFANIE: So I shock and take the chocolate.

2215
02:51:00,955 --> 02:51:04,598
SAM: Roll a damage roll.

2216
02:51:04,598 --> 02:51:18,051
STEFANIE: I need to borrow a d8 because my d8 gets
twos. Thank you. Seven!

2217
02:51:18,051 --> 02:51:23,775
SAM: Seven, okay. You are stunned for a second as
a bolt of electricity shoots from her hand into

2218
02:51:23,775 --> 02:51:29,759
your arm and up into your neck. You kind of spasm
out for a second. She grabs your chocolate out of

2219
02:51:29,759 --> 02:51:31,906
your chest. I guess, do you have chocolate in
there?

2220
02:51:31,906 --> 02:51:36,582
H. MICHAEL: No, it's all popcorn and shit! It's
dry goods! I don't have anything that's going to

2221
02:51:36,582 --> 02:51:38,086
melt in my chest!

2222
02:51:38,086 --> 02:51:47,846
SAM: So you get, like, some gorp. You use your
movement to dart away. You can chase after her.

2223
02:51:47,846 --> 02:51:50,545
H. MICHAEL: Am I dealt seven points of damage?

2224
02:51:50,545 --> 02:51:51,803
SAM: Yes.

2225
02:51:51,803 --> 02:51:56,333
YURI: Just for having gorp!

2226
02:51:56,333 --> 02:52:07,528
STEFANIE: It didn't have to be this way. I run
away, eating this and yelling at him. It could

2227
02:52:07,528 --> 02:52:09,207
have been different!

2228
02:52:09,207 --> 02:52:15,295
H. MICHAEL: It's a very small boat, so after I
recover, I walk over and I go, what the actual

2229
02:52:15,295 --> 02:52:19,593
fuck?! I was feeding you two hours ago!

2230
02:52:19,593 --> 02:52:21,873
STEFANIE: I'm hungry!

2231
02:52:21,873 --> 02:52:26,767
H. MICHAEL: Then fucking ask me, you crazy
asshole!

2232
02:52:26,767 --> 02:52:30,501
STEFANIE: It's been a really stressful trip!

2233
02:52:30,501 --> 02:52:36,632
H. MICHAEL: Oh, that's a great reason to reach
inside of my fucking chest cavity <i>for granola!</i>

2234
02:52:36,632 --> 02:52:42,669
STEFANIE: You know what I came on this boat for?
It was because I haven't been hugged by someone in

2235
02:52:42,669 --> 02:52:48,259
two years! And you know what? My physical touch is
so needed!

2236
02:52:48,259 --> 02:52:51,564
H. MICHAEL: I'm going to use a straw point to
attack four times.

2237
02:52:51,564 --> 02:52:54,980
SAM: He's a monk. These are ki points.

2238
02:52:54,980 --> 02:53:00,343
H. MICHAEL: I'm going to use my fist attack. Does
that give me advantage as well?

2239
02:53:00,343 --> 02:53:05,933
SAM: No, you don't get advantage. It's a sneak
attack round. What does that do? Molly, what does

2240
02:53:05,933 --> 02:53:11,936
a sneak attack round do? Does he get advantage on
it? Sure, advantage on your first attack.

2241
02:53:11,936 --> 02:53:14,676
H. MICHAEL: On my first attack? For double
damage?

2242
02:53:14,676 --> 02:53:19,012
SAM: Just advantage, so you roll twice to see if
you hit the first time.

2243
02:53:19,012 --> 02:53:34,875
H. MICHAEL: For my attack, let's see. That's a 16
and that's a 14.

2244
02:53:34,875 --> 02:53:37,841
SAM: So you definitely hit her. Roll for damage.

2245
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:40,850
H. MICHAEL: All right, and then I use the d4? Is
that right?

2246
02:53:40,850 --> 02:53:45,537
SAM: Yes, for an unarmed strike, d4. Plus two, I
think.

2247
02:53:45,537 --> 02:53:47,631
H. MICHAEL: So I get double damage for the first
one?

2248
02:53:47,631 --> 02:53:49,906
SAM: Sure, why not?

2249
02:53:49,906 --> 02:53:51,390
H. MICHAEL: I got a one.

2250
02:53:51,390 --> 02:53:52,998
SAM: Okay, so that's three, so that's six.

2251
02:53:52,998 --> 02:53:56,018
H. MICHAEL: This plus five, wait, is that right?

2252
02:53:56,018 --> 02:54:01,741
SAM: No, it's after that. I think it's a 1d4 plus
two. So you've gotten six points of damage so far.

2253
02:54:01,741 --> 02:54:08,548
You can take three more attacks. No, you have to
roll that d20 three more times to see if you hit

2254
02:54:08,548 --> 02:54:09,889
each time.

2255
02:54:09,889 --> 02:54:14,543
H. MICHAEL: Oh, I understand. Okay, sorry. 11
plus--

2256
02:54:14,543 --> 02:54:22,780
SAM: That's not going to hit. Wait, her AC is 16?
You have a plus five to hit, or a plus four?

2257
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:27,759
Noelle, help. Unarmed strike.

2258
02:54:27,759 --> 02:54:29,468
H. MICHAEL: Plus five.

2259
02:54:29,468 --> 02:54:31,425
SAM: You do hit. Yes, that hits.

2260
02:54:31,425 --> 02:54:32,654
H. MICHAEL: Okay, great.

2261
02:54:32,654 --> 02:54:33,901
STEFANIE: What time is it?

2262
02:54:33,901 --> 02:54:35,771
SAM: It's 11:30 PM.

2263
02:54:35,771 --> 02:54:38,935
STEFANIE: So we're still on the same day of our
actions from the fighting?

2264
02:54:38,935 --> 02:54:40,211
SAM: Yes, correct.

2265
02:54:40,211 --> 02:54:44,523
H. MICHAEL: So, six plus two is eight damage, and
then I rolled a 14 for the next one, so I hit on

2266
02:54:44,523 --> 02:54:46,051
that with 19.

2267
02:54:46,051 --> 02:54:47,883
SAM: Yeah, roll for damage.

2268
02:54:47,883 --> 02:54:56,622
H. MICHAEL: Well, she attacked me! So two plus two
is another four, so what is that? Four?

2269
02:54:56,622 --> 02:55:01,735
SAM: Yep, that's it, just four. You're at 18 right
now, according to what you've been telling me.

2270
02:55:01,735 --> 02:55:08,433
H.MICHAEL: I think I'm at 14 because I had six,
four, four. I rolled a 20.

2271
02:55:08,433 --> 02:55:12,536
SAM: That's going to crit so roll your damage and
double it.

2272
02:55:12,536 --> 02:55:16,573
H.MICHAEL: Two plus two, so eight.

2273
02:55:16,573 --> 02:55:20,944
SAM: You just took 22 points of damage. Are you
alive?

2274
02:55:20,944 --> 02:55:23,444
STEFANIE: Oh, I'm motherfucking alive.

2275
02:55:23,444 --> 02:55:40,371
SAM: Before you attack back, where were you guys?
Had you all gone to sleep yet?

2276
02:55:40,371 --> 02:55:42,725
AMY: I'm sleeping soundly.

2277
02:55:42,725 --> 02:55:47,162
YURI: I'm still singing lullabies to the
children.

2278
02:55:47,162 --> 02:55:51,202
SAM: So you hear a scuffle and can go to
investigate, but it will take you a little bit to

2279
02:55:51,202 --> 02:55:52,330
get there.

2280
02:55:52,330 --> 02:55:55,780
YURI: I would like to go investigate as fast as
possible.

2281
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:58,531
SAM: You're running over to the melee. Peter and
Wendy, where are you guys?

2282
02:55:58,531 --> 02:56:02,104
MOLLY: I'm laying awake, you know, when you go to
bed mad?

2283
02:56:02,104 --> 02:56:06,402
SAM: You found a hammock and rolling there.

2284
02:56:06,402 --> 02:56:08,332
MOLLY: Very stiff, yeah.

2285
02:56:08,332 --> 02:56:12,228
NOELLE: I've gone over and I'm scritching the
Beast again.

2286
02:56:12,228 --> 02:56:14,356
SAM: He's asleep and he's loving it.

2287
02:56:14,356 --> 02:56:19,471
NOELLE: Yeah, I hear the sounds, but I'm just
like, eh, that'll keep.

2288
02:56:19,471 --> 02:56:24,941
SAM: Okay, go ahead, Goldilocks, and attack back
if you care to.

2289
02:56:24,941 --> 02:56:26,491
H.MICHAEL: After this, I go like--

2290
02:56:26,491 --> 02:56:30,545
SAM: What, what is that?

2291
02:56:30,545 --> 02:56:32,571
H.MICHAEL: I don't want to kill her.

2292
02:56:32,571 --> 02:56:35,174
SAM: You almost just did.

2293
02:56:35,174 --> 02:56:41,508
H.MICHAEL: She woke me up, shock attacked me, so I
just whaled on her and now I'm like--

2294
02:56:41,508 --> 02:56:46,641
STEFANIE: No, you took time to run to the other
side of the ship, and then you whaled on me.

2295
02:56:46,641 --> 02:56:50,695
H.MICHAEL:You're defending yourself for reaching
in my body for fucking granola!

2296
02:56:50,695 --> 02:56:59,809
SAM: Okay it's Goldilocks' turn, he just whaled on
you with his floppy arms, you got hit every which

2297
02:56:59,809 --> 02:57:02,746
direction, you don't know what's going on. Goldie,
what are you doing?

2298
02:57:02,746 --> 02:57:09,136
STEFANIE: So we're still the same day, so I can't
use my Thunderwave. Fine. I will use my bonus

2299
02:57:09,136 --> 02:57:30,449
action, which is a Second Wind, so I get 1d10 plus
four heal once per day. So I get a plus seven. I'm

2300
02:57:30,449 --> 02:57:40,990
back to over half of what my life was. Did I have
my longsword or not? Did I need to summon it?

2301
02:57:40,990 --> 02:57:43,872
SAM: You can summon it-- well you can't summon it
now because you just used your bonus action.

2302
02:57:43,872 --> 02:57:49,615
STEFANIE: I'll use my action surge, which gives me
one extra action per day, to summon my longsword,

2303
02:57:49,615 --> 02:57:53,004
and then I take my longsword and attack.

2304
02:57:53,004 --> 02:57:54,885
SAM: Roll for attack.

2305
02:57:54,885 --> 02:57:57,367
AMY: Can I see if I do hear this?

2306
02:57:57,367 --> 02:58:02,330
SAM: Roll a perception check, with disadvantage
because you are asleep.

2307
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:06,189
STEFANIE: 14 plus five. 19.

2308
02:58:06,189 --> 02:58:07,578
SAM: For sure, you hit.

2309
02:58:07,578 --> 02:58:13,590
STEFANIE: That is 1d8 plus two, three plus two. So
five.

2310
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:15,357
MOLLY: Can I come over?

2311
02:58:15,357 --> 02:58:18,944
SAM: You are waking up and walking over. H, it's
your turn.

2312
02:58:18,944 --> 02:58:24,233
H.MICHAEL: Where are you at, hit point-wise?

2313
02:58:24,233 --> 02:58:29,087
SAM: You don't know! She's looking a little black
and blue.

2314
02:58:29,087 --> 02:58:36,010
H.MICHAEL: You're walking over? I just go, she
attacked me while I was looking out the window,

2315
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:38,592
because she wanted granola out of my chest!

2316
02:58:38,592 --> 02:58:41,760
STEFANIE: I was hungry, you get that, right?

2317
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:43,880
MOLLY: I'm going to cast Entangle on the area.

2318
02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:46,401
SAM: You can hit both of them with that for sure.

2319
02:58:46,401 --> 02:58:51,962
MOLLY: Leaves and vines sprout out of the wood of
the ship and grasp you. Both of you make a

2320
02:58:51,962 --> 02:58:53,694
strength saving throw.

2321
02:58:53,694 --> 02:58:59,597
SAM: Against 15, no, 13. Okay, saving throw. Help
him, Noelle.

2322
02:58:59,597 --> 02:59:03,605
NOELLE: I barely know these things.

2323
02:59:03,605 --> 02:59:05,952
SAM: I put him next to you because you're good at
this!

2324
02:59:05,952 --> 02:59:08,839
H.MICHAEL: I got a 22.

2325
02:59:08,839 --> 02:59:10,624
STEFANIE: 18.

2326
02:59:10,624 --> 02:59:19,251
SAM: Magical vines come up from the floor and wrap
around your feet. You both are like, "What the

2327
02:59:19,251 --> 02:59:23,457
"fuck?" and you step out of it. You're not
entangled, but the ground around you is difficult

2328
02:59:23,457 --> 02:59:29,414
to move on, you can't really move forward or
backwards too much. It's awkward and confusing to

2329
02:59:29,414 --> 02:59:35,447
you. The heat of the fight dies down a little bit
because you are distracted. What would you like to

2330
02:59:35,447 --> 02:59:37,383
do now? It is your turn.

2331
02:59:37,383 --> 02:59:41,674
STEFANIE: I want to tell you, I was just trying to
snuggle up next to you, and you were really mean

2332
02:59:41,674 --> 02:59:43,390
to me, okay?

2333
02:59:43,390 --> 02:59:45,313
H.MICHAEL: You put your hand in my chest.

2334
02:59:45,313 --> 02:59:51,503
STEFANIE: Some people would consider that
flirting. It's been a long time.

2335
02:59:51,503 --> 02:59:55,799
H.MICHAEL: I'm very sensitive about having fingers
in my cavities without warning!

2336
02:59:55,799 --> 02:59:59,646
MOLLY and STEFANIE: That's fair.

2337
02:59:59,646 --> 03:00:02,925
H MICHAEL: Well, I apologize for attacking you four
times.

2338
03:00:02,925 --> 03:00:06,427
STEFANIE: And almost killing me?

2339
03:00:06,427 --> 03:00:07,731
H MICHAEL: Yeah.

2340
03:00:07,731 --> 03:00:10,913
STEFANIE: Because some people, at least when I was
blonde, would've been like: oh, that's awesome.

2341
03:00:10,913 --> 03:00:12,586
But you're like, no, I want to kill you.

2342
03:00:12,586 --> 03:00:19,028
H MICHAEL: I did sort of a flirty thing, I thought
you were making a big move, and then you did this

2343
03:00:19,028 --> 03:00:25,881
shock move on me. And it really hurt my feelings,
and literally hurt my body. You fucking

2344
03:00:25,881 --> 03:00:33,534
electrocuted me. Because I wouldn't give you my
chest granola. I feel like I'm in the right here.

2345
03:00:33,534 --> 03:00:43,790
STEFANIE: I don't know, I'm used to getting-- When
I was Goldilocks, when I was blonde, it was just

2346
03:00:43,790 --> 03:00:45,902
easier. I don't know, I was right all the time.

2347
03:00:45,902 --> 03:00:50,916
H MICHAEL: Okay, I'm not going to argue with your
perception of how your life has changed since this

2348
03:00:50,916 --> 03:00:56,091
hair color thing happened. But I'm just going to
go ahead and say that I don't feel like this is a

2349
03:00:56,091 --> 03:00:59,021
hair color issue, but let's just leave it.

2350
03:00:59,021 --> 03:01:01,253
STEFANIE: Fine.

2351
03:01:01,253 --> 03:01:08,952
H MICHAEL: It's been a crazy day, we're all worked
up, we're all trying to find love.

2352
03:01:08,952 --> 03:01:17,089
SAM: As you part, everyone very eventually finds
their way to a bed or something.

2353
03:01:17,089 --> 03:01:20,542
H MICHAEL: Can somebody fucking heal me?

2354
03:01:20,542 --> 03:01:27,216
SAM: You fall asleep, gaining all of your hit
points back again. And all your spells.

2355
03:01:27,216 --> 03:01:29,768
NOELLE: I want to spoon the Beast as we fall
asleep.

2356
03:01:29,768 --> 03:01:39,069
SAM: Okay, the Beast does not notice. He feels a
warm arm on him and feels nice all night. You guys

2357
03:01:39,069 --> 03:01:48,405
have a nice slumber through the night, the rocking
sea lulls you into a nice, calm rest. All hit

2358
03:01:48,405 --> 03:01:52,776
points and spells are regained, you're back to
normal again. And you sleep for about six to seven

2359
03:01:52,776 --> 03:02:00,579
hours, and are jolted awake suddenly as the Jolly
Roger slams into something.

2360
03:02:00,579 --> 03:02:02,844
NOELLE: Who was driving the boat?

2361
03:02:02,844 --> 03:02:10,599
SAM: One of the Lost Boys. Let's say, for the sake
of brevity, you guys took turns, fuck it. You run

2362
03:02:10,599 --> 03:02:17,072
to the deck to investigate, and see that you've
actually run aground on a sandy beach. Clouds have

2363
03:02:17,072 --> 03:02:23,165
moved in overhead, it's an overcast day, making
everything a little bit difficult to-- not

2364
03:02:23,165 --> 03:02:28,949
difficult to see, but just casting a grey hue on
everything. You are definitely on an island. The

2365
03:02:28,949 --> 03:02:36,561
Beast runs up and says, "I cannot believe our good
fortune, we're here. This is Pleasure Island." He

2366
03:02:36,561 --> 03:02:42,574
rolls out a rope ladder and begins climbing down
to the beach excitedly. "It's right up here. Our

2367
03:02:42,574 --> 03:02:47,240
"singles' party headquarters, this is where we are
going to do the all-night mixer, the limbo party--

2368
03:02:47,435 --> 03:02:53,962
"oh, it would've been so fun-- the fire walk.
Inside, there is this amazing hot coal path. To

2369
03:02:53,962 --> 03:02:59,956
"prove you're really in love, a couple has to walk
across the hot coals and kiss in the center, it's

2370
03:02:59,956 --> 03:03:03,117
"very romantic. Come, come." And he starts dashing
up the beach.

2371
03:03:03,117 --> 03:03:05,003
NOELLE: I want to roll a perception check on the
island.

2372
03:03:05,003 --> 03:03:06,758
SAM: Insight, oh, perception, go for it.

2373
03:03:06,758 --> 03:03:08,195
NOELLE: Either one. Insight?

2374
03:03:08,195 --> 03:03:09,270
SAM: Go for it, yeah, perception, yeah. This is
good.

2375
03:03:09,270 --> 03:03:13,835
NOELLE: That's a 14.

2376
03:03:13,835 --> 03:03:20,504
SAM: Okay, as far as you can see, there's a
treeline up at the top of the dunes, and nothing

2377
03:03:20,504 --> 03:03:22,210
much beyond it.

2378
03:03:22,210 --> 03:03:26,339
H MICHAEL: I'd like to roll-- I'm sorry, is
insight reading into his actions? Okay, I'd like

2379
03:03:26,339 --> 03:03:27,793
to roll insight on him.

2380
03:03:27,793 --> 03:03:29,677
SAM: Okay, go ahead and roll.

2381
03:03:29,677 --> 03:03:31,431
STEFANIE: This guy is in serious denial.

2382
03:03:31,431 --> 03:03:32,998
H MICHAEL: Seven plus two. Nine.

2383
03:03:32,998 --> 03:03:39,067
SAM: Yeah, he seems genuinely excited to be here,
and you haven't seen him smile like this since he

2384
03:03:39,067 --> 03:03:47,089
found out his wife was cheating on him and dead.
All right, so he's darting across the beach, what

2385
03:03:47,089 --> 03:03:48,717
do you guys want to do?

2386
03:03:48,717 --> 03:03:52,014
YURI: I want to follow him.

2387
03:03:52,014 --> 03:03:56,001
SAM: Hatter climbs down the rope ladder and starts
moving across the sand.

2388
03:03:56,001 --> 03:04:00,981
MOLLY: I'm going to untie the Lost Boys, where I
assume they were tied up or something, and be

2389
03:04:00,981 --> 03:04:10,047
like: take this boat, go back to your clubhouse or
go find some parents or something, it's not us.

2390
03:04:10,047 --> 03:04:13,724
You guys have to fend for yourselves, okay?

2391
03:04:13,724 --> 03:04:15,658
AMY: Wait, are you giving them the ship?

2392
03:04:15,658 --> 03:04:19,104
NOELLE: They tried to kill us with the ship, they
killed a lot of people with the ship.

2393
03:04:19,104 --> 03:04:20,623
AMY: And how are we getting off of this?

2394
03:04:20,623 --> 03:04:21,959
NOELLE: Maybe don't untie them.

2395
03:04:21,959 --> 03:04:23,879
MOLLY; I already did.

2396
03:04:23,879 --> 03:04:27,451
SAM: "Woohoo! The ship is ours!"

2397
03:04:27,451 --> 03:04:31,587
MOLLY: There are other ships on this island.

2398
03:04:31,587 --> 03:04:33,348
NOELLE: Are there other ships on this island?

2399
03:04:33,348 --> 03:04:44,464
AMY: Children, if you take this ship back to your
Neverland, I will find you and beat you with my

2400
03:04:44,464 --> 03:04:47,349
scepter. And I will be your mommy.

2401
03:04:47,349 --> 03:04:49,329
NOELLE: She's the mommy.

2402
03:04:49,329 --> 03:04:51,495
MOLLY: I feel like we're giving them mixed
messages.

2403
03:04:51,495 --> 03:04:57,041
AMY: Well, I'm just saying, how are we going to
get away from this island without the ship?

2404
03:04:57,041 --> 03:05:04,295
SAM: The smart one, Curly, steps forward and says,
"We don't really know what you want us to do, but

2405
03:05:04,295 --> 03:05:07,196
"why don't we sit here with the ship until you come
back?"

2406
03:05:07,196 --> 03:05:09,687
AMY: And I go: Boop!

2407
03:05:09,687 --> 03:05:12,460
SAM: He smiles at you; he loves it.

2408
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:16,117
STEFANIE: What if they take the ship?

2409
03:05:16,117 --> 03:05:19,184
YURI: We're trapped on Pleasure Island, it'll be
awesome!

2410
03:05:19,184 --> 03:05:20,663
NOELLE: It's not awesome!

2411
03:05:20,663 --> 03:05:22,768
SAM: The Beast has now disappeared into the
treeline.

2412
03:05:22,768 --> 03:05:24,537
NOELLE: I'll track him!

2413
03:05:24,537 --> 03:05:25,867
SAM: Okay!

2414
03:05:25,867 --> 03:05:29,020
YURI: I was following. How close was I following?

2415
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:33,463
H MICHAEL: Is this the natural thing that happens
in a game this long, or are we just drunk?

2416
03:05:33,463 --> 03:05:39,219
SAM: Hatter's the only one who still sees him
disappearing into the forest.

2417
03:05:39,219 --> 03:05:41,115
NOELLE: I see the Hatter disappearing and I follow
him.

2418
03:05:41,115 --> 03:05:44,854
H MICHAEL: I'm very fast, so I head off. I don't
follow with the group, I head off to the side.

2419
03:05:44,854 --> 03:05:46,382
SAM: You're flanking.

2420
03:05:46,382 --> 03:05:47,731
H MICHAEL: I'm flanking.

2421
03:05:47,731 --> 03:05:52,762
SAM: You go into the treeline. It's very dense
brush. It's jungly, it's hard to make your way

2422
03:05:52,762 --> 03:05:58,541
through. You're fast, and you cut through the
underbrush as fast as you can. Hatter is still

2423
03:05:58,541 --> 03:06:01,848
following Beast. Roll a survival check, Hatter.

2424
03:06:01,848 --> 03:06:05,050
YURI: I'm going to roll one of these cool Wyrmwood
ones, now that I've found them.

2425
03:06:05,050 --> 03:06:07,340
SAM: Those are not Wyrmwood dice, those are
Travis' dice.

2426
03:06:07,340 --> 03:06:12,544
YURI: Oh, these are Travis' dice? I have Travis'
dice? Then this is going to be terrible, isn't it?

2427
03:06:12,544 --> 03:06:14,174
SAM: Go for it.

2428
03:06:14,174 --> 03:06:15,634
YURI: 15.

2429
03:06:15,634 --> 03:06:21,708
SAM: Sure, survival, you got it. You expertly
track him as you go through the jungle, following

2430
03:06:21,708 --> 03:06:23,638
his every turn. You guys all following?

2431
03:06:23,638 --> 03:06:25,845
NOELLE and MOLLY: Yeah.

2432
03:06:25,845 --> 03:06:28,668
SAM: Yes? Okay. Everyone's following. You make
your way--

2433
03:06:28,668 --> 03:06:31,104
MOLLY: I've been tying the Lost Boys to trees.

2434
03:06:31,104 --> 03:06:35,232
NOELLE: So you're going to untie them and tie them
to something else? They're getting confusing

2435
03:06:35,232 --> 03:06:36,835
messages right now!

2436
03:06:36,835 --> 03:06:42,410
SAM: You get them off the ship, tie them to trees?
They're very weak from exhaustion, they just let

2437
03:06:42,410 --> 03:06:43,634
it happen.

2438
03:06:43,634 --> 03:06:45,516
MOLLY: I can do whatever.

2439
03:06:45,516 --> 03:06:50,937
SAM: Everyone besides Wendy is following the
Beast.

2440
03:06:50,937 --> 03:06:54,455
NOELLE: It takes a while to tie seven boys to
trees!

2441
03:06:54,455 --> 03:07:01,163
SAM: Wendy is for sure lost. You can use survival
to try to track their footprints.

2442
03:07:01,163 --> 03:07:03,649
MOLLY: I only got a nine for survival.

2443
03:07:03,649 --> 03:07:08,764
SAM: So you think you found a couple footprints
and a broken twig and you're following it.

2444
03:07:08,764 --> 03:07:12,620
MOLLY: I'm following it. I'm a druid! I'm in touch
with nature.

2445
03:07:12,620 --> 03:07:19,897
SAM: The rest of you are following the Beast. He's
saying, "Right up this way! Keep up!" Up ahead,

2446
03:07:19,897 --> 03:07:26,855
the jungle has grown very dense, it's dark in here
almost like nightfall because there's no sun

2447
03:07:26,855 --> 03:07:32,551
overhead. You're drawn to the dim red glow of a
building. It's not lit by torches or anything like

2448
03:07:32,551 --> 03:07:38,770
that, this red glow comes from inside the building
and shines faintly through the walls, the cracks,

2449
03:07:38,770 --> 03:07:45,622
the windows. Everything has this red glowing hue
to it. You're also met with a powerful, pungent

2450
03:07:45,622 --> 03:07:52,511
odor. The strong warm scents of candy: chocolate,
vanilla, ginger and apple, caramel and sugar,

2451
03:07:52,511 --> 03:07:59,163
nougat, even custard. As you draw closer, you see
why: this building is actually a massive

2452
03:07:59,163 --> 03:08:07,325
gingerbread house. The Beast explains, "We
inherited the house from Hansel, may he rest in

2453
03:08:07,325 --> 03:08:15,280
"peace, and Gretel's witch. She donated it to the company
after we found ehr a husband, nice guy named Gary.

2454
03:08:15,280 --> 03:08:23,190
"Their wedding was really sweet. Anyway, we'll find
help inside, my people are in there." As you get

2455
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:30,135
closer an arrow whizzes by Peter Pan's head.
Another arrow shoots by the Scarecrow's head and

2456
03:08:30,135 --> 03:08:37,868
impacts in a tree next to the Queen. The Beast
calls up ahead, "Oh no, hold your fire! These are

2457
03:08:37,868 --> 03:08:44,063
"friends." He turns to you all and says, "You know
what? Wait here at the door. Let me go inside and

2458
03:08:44,063 --> 03:08:50,230
"make sure nothing dangerous happens. They weren't
expecting us until late today, so they're probably

2459
03:08:50,230 --> 03:08:55,340
"on edge. We have new security that we've hired.
Let me go in and make sure everything's all

2460
03:08:55,340 --> 03:09:00,924
"right." He disappears into a large wooden door,
slams it behind him. What would you like to do?

2461
03:09:00,924 --> 03:09:02,685
STEFANIE: Can I roll a perception check on Beast?

2462
03:09:02,685 --> 03:09:05,999
SAM: Insight? Sure.

2463
03:09:05,999 --> 03:09:08,444
STEFANIE: Insight check on Beast. I have a 20.

2464
03:09:08,444 --> 03:09:15,550
SAM: The Beast's got fur, but weirdly, he's
sweating. Sweat is pouring off of his eyebrows and

2465
03:09:15,550 --> 03:09:17,747
he seems really nervous about something.

2466
03:09:17,747 --> 03:09:20,351
NOELLE: I would like to cast Detect Thoughts on
Beast.

2467
03:09:20,351 --> 03:09:22,225
SAM: As he's talking, you cast Detect Thoughts.

2468
03:09:22,225 --> 03:09:23,564
NOELLE: That is a nat 20!

2469
03:09:23,564 --> 03:09:29,579
SAM: I think it's your spell DC, which is 14,
right?

2470
03:09:29,579 --> 03:09:32,512
NOELLE: That doesn't actually do that, but, you
know what? I did roll a nat 20, so I feel like

2471
03:09:32,512 --> 03:09:34,667
that should count for something.

2472
03:09:34,667 --> 03:09:39,582
SAM: He rolled an 18. His pupils dilate, but he
shakes off the--

2473
03:09:39,582 --> 03:09:42,011
NOELLE: He doesn't get a saving throw for Detect
Thoughts.

2474
03:09:42,011 --> 03:09:43,951
SAM: Oh, you're right!

2475
03:09:43,951 --> 03:09:45,676
NOELLE: We both did this wrong!

2476
03:09:45,676 --> 03:09:51,747
SAM: Yes! You can definitely sense his surface
thoughts. His surface thoughts are, "I've got to

2477
03:09:51,747 --> 03:09:54,795
"go. I've got to get inside and talk to Jack
right away."

2478
03:09:55,451 --> 03:09:57,183
NOELLE: I would like to probe deeper!

2479
03:09:57,183 --> 03:10:01,673
SAM: We've rolled against that and resolved the
roll. You are not able to probe any deeper than

2480
03:10:01,673 --> 03:10:03,063
that.

2481
03:10:03,063 --> 03:10:06,363
NOELLE: Right. Okay.

2482
03:10:06,363 --> 03:10:08,265
MOLLY: Guys?

2483
03:10:08,265 --> 03:10:11,599
SAM: Roll another survival check.

2484
03:10:11,599 --> 03:10:15,577
MOLLY: Yeah. Oh, nat 20.

2485
03:10:15,577 --> 03:10:26,183
SAM: Weirdly, you come up around the back of this
building. You're drawn to the nougat and caramel

2486
03:10:26,183 --> 03:10:31,533
smell. You can see your friends around the side of
the building. You make your way up to them. You

2487
03:10:31,533 --> 03:10:33,266
are rejoined.

2488
03:10:33,266 --> 03:10:35,216
H MICHAEL: I'd like to roll-- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to cut you off.

2489
03:10:35,216 --> 03:10:36,919
MOLLY: No, I'm here!

2490
03:10:36,919 --> 03:10:40,445
H MICHAEL: I'd like to roll perception on where
the arrows are coming from.

2491
03:10:40,445 --> 03:10:48,663
SAM: The gingerbread house is mostly a one-story
building. It is very large. Candy adorns the

2492
03:10:48,663 --> 03:10:56,706
walls. There are lollipops, beautiful trickling
chocolate that has hardened over the side. There

2493
03:10:56,706 --> 03:11:03,765
are two turrets that have little slits for archers
to peek through on both sides of the house. They

2494
03:11:03,765 --> 03:11:08,287
seemed to have come from those little slits, but
you can't see who's in there.

2495
03:11:08,287 --> 03:11:11,384
MOLLY: Could I roll a perception check as I come
around the back?

2496
03:11:11,384 --> 03:11:13,201
SAM: Sure. What do you want to look at?

2497
03:11:13,201 --> 03:11:22,587
MOLLY: I'm looking to see if I notice anything
else interesting about this place. I got a 17. As

2498
03:11:22,587 --> 03:11:27,750
I'm coming around, I'm trying to see what this
house is because I'm not sure if my friends are

2499
03:11:27,750 --> 03:11:29,272
here yet or not.

2500
03:11:29,272 --> 03:11:36,936
SAM: You don't see any other people around other
than them. Weirdly, there's a discarded bag in the

2501
03:11:36,936 --> 03:11:43,538
forest and you open the bag and find something in
it. Sorry.

2502
03:11:43,538 --> 03:11:45,347
MOLLY: I find everything!

2503
03:11:45,347 --> 03:11:48,885
SAM: It's weird, it's a small piece of fabric.

2504
03:11:48,885 --> 03:11:51,618
MOLLY: Yes, I do find this thing!

2505
03:11:51,618 --> 03:11:58,667
SAM: Yes, you do. A moment or two goes by, the
Beast still hasn't come back. From inside-- yes,

2506
03:11:58,667 --> 03:12:00,426
Hatter?

2507
03:12:00,426 --> 03:12:06,457
YURI: Because I was following him closest, can I
go up and lick the door?

2508
03:12:06,457 --> 03:12:11,426
SAM: Absolutely. You lick the door and find that
it is dark chocolate and cherry.

2509
03:12:11,426 --> 03:12:15,312
MOLLY: I come running up. Do you guys want to go
in?

2510
03:12:15,312 --> 03:12:16,938
NOELLE: Let's go in!

2511
03:12:16,938 --> 03:12:19,995
AMY: Wendy, are the children sufficiently tied
up?

2512
03:12:19,995 --> 03:12:21,374
MOLLY: I leashed them, yes.

2513
03:12:21,374 --> 03:12:26,045
SAM: They are sugar-glass windows. There are two
or three of them around the side of the building.

2514
03:12:26,045 --> 03:12:28,986
MOLLY: I just found this thing.

2515
03:12:28,986 --> 03:12:36,819
SAM: From inside the gingerbread house, you hear a
female scream and male laughter. Also, someone

2516
03:12:36,819 --> 03:12:39,345
cursing in Italian.

2517
03:12:39,345 --> 03:12:44,521
MOLLY: I hate all three of those sounds. Come
around to the side.

2518
03:12:44,521 --> 03:12:46,585
SAM: You're going to smash the window?

2519
03:12:46,585 --> 03:12:50,263
NOELLE: I hear a sound and I go inside. I still
smash it partly in.

2520
03:12:50,263 --> 03:12:53,138
SAM: Just roll.

2521
03:12:53,138 --> 03:12:57,504
NOELLE: I just jump. That is a six. I don't know
what I'm rolling for.

2522
03:12:57,504 --> 03:13:03,857
SAM: Wendy grabs your arm and your strike goes
errant and hits the gingerbread and knocks off a

2523
03:13:03,857 --> 03:13:05,089
chunk of gingerbread.

2524
03:13:05,089 --> 03:13:09,555
MOLLY: Come on. I take this thing out of my bag
and slap it against the wall.

2525
03:13:09,555 --> 03:13:10,938
NOELLE: What is it?!

2526
03:13:10,938 --> 03:13:17,173
SAM: It's a piece of fabric, what, six feet wide?
The piece of fabric adheres to the side of the

2527
03:13:17,173 --> 03:13:23,644
gingerbread house and all of a sudden the
gingerbread melts away, revealing a hole six feet

2528
03:13:23,644 --> 03:13:25,373
in diameter.

2529
03:13:25,373 --> 03:13:26,448
MOLLY: Ten feet.

2530
03:13:26,448 --> 03:13:32,275
SAM: Ten feet. It's through the gingerbread, which
is about six inches of wall. There's now a hole

2531
03:13:32,275 --> 03:13:38,139
into this building that you can look. It's dim
inside, but glowing red. Would you like to go in,

2532
03:13:38,139 --> 03:13:39,757
peer in, what would you like to do?

2533
03:13:39,757 --> 03:13:41,511
MOLLY: Come on!

2534
03:13:41,511 --> 03:13:45,510
AMY: I'm clearly not one for waiting too long.

2535
03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:47,052
MOLLY: A lady was screaming; let's go!

2536
03:13:47,052 --> 03:13:48,855
YURI: A grab the Queen of Hearts' hand and we rush
in.

2537
03:13:48,855 --> 03:13:52,069
AMY: I like it very much!

2538
03:13:52,069 --> 03:14:05,532
(cheering)

2539
03:14:05,532 --> 03:14:12,088
SAM: This is what you can do with all of your
kids' Legos. You do not go in through the front

2540
03:14:12,088 --> 03:14:14,944
door. Instead, you're going to come over here.

2541
03:14:14,944 --> 03:14:19,462
NOELLE: Whoa, break this building!

2542
03:14:19,462 --> 03:14:25,960
SAM: There's a hole here and you guys are going
in. Who's going first?

2543
03:14:25,960 --> 03:14:30,934
H MICHAEL: I took a picture of you because I saw
how proud you were of this.

2544
03:14:30,934 --> 03:14:36,973
SAM: Who does? Wendy's going first. That's Wendy
right there. Who's next?

2545
03:14:36,973 --> 03:14:38,837
AMY: Hatter and the Queen.

2546
03:14:38,837 --> 03:14:40,479
YURI: Yes. Hatter and the Queen, holding hands.

2547
03:14:40,479 --> 03:14:42,338
AMY: Holding hands, not letting go.

2548
03:14:42,338 --> 03:14:44,612
SAM: Who else?

2549
03:14:44,612 --> 03:14:49,496
STEFANIE: I run in, but I grab off a piece of dark
chocolate on the way in.

2550
03:14:49,496 --> 03:14:52,757
AMY: There it is! You found it!

2551
03:14:52,757 --> 03:14:54,519
SAM: We're going to say you go over here.

2552
03:14:54,519 --> 03:14:56,189
STEFANIE: I don't need a Scarecrow!

2553
03:14:56,189 --> 03:14:58,549
SAM: Scarecrow and Pete.

2554
03:14:58,549 --> 03:15:05,133
NOELLE: I'm going to go in, but I'm going to
disguise myself as some gumdrops. I'm going to use

2555
03:15:05,133 --> 03:15:09,327
Disguise Self to look like candy gumdrops and
chocolate.

2556
03:15:09,327 --> 03:15:11,433
SAM: I'm going to say this is Peter Pan.

2557
03:15:11,433 --> 03:15:14,550
AMY: Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

2558
03:15:14,550 --> 03:15:15,916
SAM: They look like gumdrops.

2559
03:15:15,916 --> 03:15:17,525
NOELLE: I flatten against a wall.

2560
03:15:17,525 --> 03:15:19,535
SAM: You're over here with a bunch of candy.

2561
03:15:19,535 --> 03:15:24,965
H MICHAEL: I'm not going to enter through the
hole. I'm going to come around the side and I'm

2562
03:15:24,965 --> 03:15:32,364
going to use my spider pill to crawl up the wall
and try to break one of the windows so I can come

2563
03:15:32,364 --> 03:15:33,728
in from a different angle.

2564
03:15:33,728 --> 03:15:38,307
SAM: Roll a strength check. His spider pill gives
him Spider Climb, so he's walking up the side of

2565
03:15:38,307 --> 03:15:40,603
the wall like Spider-Man would.

2566
03:15:40,603 --> 03:15:43,093
H MICHAEL: I rolled a five plus two.

2567
03:15:43,093 --> 03:15:47,593
SAM: You're knocking on it. It takes some time.
You're up there working on it. I'll put you up

2568
03:15:47,593 --> 03:15:49,337
there for now.

2569
03:15:49,337 --> 03:15:50,928
MOLLY: That's so cool.

2570
03:15:50,928 --> 03:15:57,758
SAM: You walk in. Where am I? The main hall is
dimly lit, shadows streaking across the walls

2571
03:15:57,758 --> 03:16:04,345
making it hard to identify much. As you get
closer, you see the source of the light: a large,

2572
03:16:04,345 --> 03:16:14,761
20-foot long track in the center of the room, red
with glowing, blistering embers. It is the hot

2573
03:16:14,761 --> 03:16:22,146
coal path. Warmth emanates across the room. On the
opposite side of the room, over here, these guys

2574
03:16:22,146 --> 03:16:29,986
over here are ice sculptures. Three ice
sculptures. Let's see here, who's closest?

2575
03:16:29,986 --> 03:16:32,562
Goldilocks, make a quick perception check.

2576
03:16:32,562 --> 03:16:37,218
STEFANIE: I roll a 14 plus, anything?

2577
03:16:37,218 --> 03:16:44,099
SAM: That's fine, that'll do it. Their faces are
in agony, but they've been positioned together in

2578
03:16:44,099 --> 03:16:48,812
a way that makes them look like they're locked in
romantic poses.

2579
03:16:48,812 --> 03:16:50,163
STEFANIE: The ice sculptures?

2580
03:16:50,163 --> 03:16:51,233
NOELLE: Fuck!

2581
03:16:51,233 --> 03:16:56,020
SAM: Then you see four more ice sculptures, or--
no, they're not complete. Glowing with purple

2582
03:16:56,020 --> 03:17:02,853
magical energy, you see that they are living human
beings in various stages of being frozen. You

2583
03:17:02,853 --> 03:17:10,565
recognize the frozen face of Robin Hood, weak and
exhausted Baba Yaga, and there's Gepetto, his

2584
03:17:10,565 --> 03:17:17,231
lower half frozen solid. Stepping out from the
back room is a large, hulking blue creature. This

2585
03:17:17,231 --> 03:17:26,141
is him right here. Boop. With icy eyes and icicles
hanging off his hands. He is laughing to himself.

2586
03:17:26,141 --> 03:17:33,891
He opens his mouth and projects ice breath onto
Baba Yaga. She screams in agony. You also see, lit

2587
03:17:33,891 --> 03:17:39,603
by the glowing embers, the Beast standing casually
behind the fiery coal pathway. He's holding

2588
03:17:39,603 --> 03:17:49,234
something. It's a face. He is roasting the severed
head of Captain Hook over the intense heat of the

2589
03:17:49,234 --> 03:17:58,299
coals. He calmly takes a bite out of it like an
apple. He's muttering to himself. "Never laughed

2590
03:17:58,299 --> 03:18:05,377
"at my jokes, always embarrassed me, and now this?"
He looks up at you and sees you because you are in

2591
03:18:05,377 --> 03:18:19,521
plain sight and says, "Oh, hello. Oops. You've
caught me. Hi. Yes. This whole thing has been my

2592
03:18:19,521 --> 03:18:26,053
"doing. Beauty filed for divorce a while ago,
leaving me no choice but to send her to the bottom

2593
03:18:26,053 --> 03:18:33,705
"of the sea. And now to learn that she was cheating
on me with Hook, it proves me right. On behalf of

2594
03:18:33,705 --> 03:18:41,437
"the Storybook Love Cruise Line, I formally
apologize for sinking your ship. Sorry. But you

2595
03:18:41,437 --> 03:18:47,960
"see, you paid for a service, and I've given you
want. You all wanted true love, unfortunately, as

2596
03:18:47,960 --> 03:18:53,375
"we've learned, true love is a lie. After the ooey
gooey part ends, all you're left with is pain and

2597
03:18:53,375 --> 03:19:01,433
"misery. So I'm just cutting out the middleman.
Singles cruises are for pathetic, stupid people

2598
03:19:01,433 --> 03:19:09,439
"who all wind up sad and alone. And I refuse to be
a part of the lie any longer. Along with my friend

2599
03:19:09,439 --> 03:19:15,372
"Jack Frost over there, we've started a new
business: changing you ugly love birds into

2600
03:19:15,372 --> 03:19:22,971
"beautiful statues. My wife turned my heart to ice,
and now I will do the same to every lover I meet."

2601
03:19:22,971 --> 03:19:28,539
Go ahead and roll for initiative as he roars at you
furiously.

2602
03:19:28,539 --> 03:19:33,978
AMY: As he does that, I look at my new friends and
I say to them: I don't know what exactly he's

2603
03:19:33,978 --> 03:19:42,889
talking about, but I have to admit that I've
fantasized about each one of you. So I know that

2604
03:19:42,889 --> 03:19:45,345
love still exists in some way!

2605
03:19:45,345 --> 03:19:49,694
STEFANIE: Goldilocks says: Homegirl, that's not
love, that's something else, but please roll.

2606
03:19:49,694 --> 03:19:55,091
NOELLE: I do look very delicious as some candy in
the corner.

2607
03:19:55,091 --> 03:19:57,972
SAM: Roll for initiative. What you got? Noelle?

2608
03:19:57,972 --> 03:19:59,639
NOELLE: I have a 15.

2609
03:19:59,639 --> 03:20:03,306
SAM: Yes, Mol?

2610
03:20:03,306 --> 03:20:04,878
MOLLY: Big old five.

2611
03:20:04,878 --> 03:20:06,745
STEFANIE: Eight.

2612
03:20:06,745 --> 03:20:12,330
AMY: Dirty 20.

2613
03:20:12,330 --> 03:20:15,850
SAM: And Hatter?

2614
03:20:15,850 --> 03:20:20,506
YURI: Dirty 18. I'm going to use Travis' dice from
now on.

2615
03:20:20,506 --> 03:20:22,073
NOELLE: This is Beast here?

2616
03:20:22,073 --> 03:20:23,213
SAM: This is Beast.

2617
03:20:23,213 --> 03:20:26,701
YURI: This is Beast on the other side of the
coals?

2618
03:20:26,701 --> 03:20:34,627
SAM: Yes. That's Jack Frost over there. That's all
you can see right now; it's pretty dark. Shit!

2619
03:20:34,627 --> 03:20:44,758
Where's my Beast shit? Where is he? Here he is.
Beast is going to roar at you guys. He is not

2620
03:20:44,758 --> 03:20:52,150
going to move. He's going to hold his attack until
someone gets closer. Top of the round. Scarecrow

2621
03:20:52,150 --> 03:20:54,504
and Queen of Hearts, who wants to go first?

2622
03:20:54,504 --> 03:20:57,314
H MICHAEL: I defer to the lady.

2623
03:20:57,314 --> 03:21:07,862
AMY: I say that thing that I said and then I look
at Beast and I say: That's right. I fantasized

2624
03:21:07,862 --> 03:21:18,244
about every single one of these people and I am
not leaving this island until I find my king! And

2625
03:21:18,244 --> 03:21:29,687
I rage. With sceptre in hand, my knuckles glowing
white with rage as I grip with all of my force. I

2626
03:21:29,687 --> 03:21:36,850
definitely move towards him as much as I can.
That's 30 and I don't actually have dash, but I

2627
03:21:36,850 --> 03:21:39,520
could use my action to move double speed?

2628
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:42,691
SAM: Sure, you can get closer to him, but you
won't be able to attack.

2629
03:21:42,691 --> 03:21:43,741
AMY: That is fine.

2630
03:21:43,741 --> 03:21:45,565
SAM: You get right up. Do you want to go around
the coals?

2631
03:21:45,565 --> 03:21:47,188
AMY: No, right through them.

2632
03:21:47,188 --> 03:21:57,675
SAM: Right through them! You get right up to the
coals. Roll a dexterity save.

2633
03:21:57,675 --> 03:22:11,195
AMY: Come on! I have advantage on dex saves, if I
can see it, which I can. That's pretty cool. Oh

2634
03:22:11,195 --> 03:22:12,778
yay! 17.

2635
03:22:12,778 --> 03:22:16,897
SAM: Okay, good. Are you resistant to anything?

2636
03:22:16,897 --> 03:22:19,628
AMY: I do have resistance, but not to fire.

2637
03:22:19,628 --> 03:22:28,440
SAM: You take two points of fire damage as you
start to run into the coals. You are within range,

2638
03:22:28,440 --> 03:22:34,950
he attacks you with his spear. He's going to throw
a spear at you.

2639
03:22:34,950 --> 03:22:37,257
AMY: Okay.

2640
03:22:37,257 --> 03:22:45,120
SAM: He only rolled a seven. His spear flies away
from him and clatters across the stone ground.

2641
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:47,644
YURI: Into a Reese's Peanut Butter cup.

2642
03:22:47,644 --> 03:22:51,959
SAM: Yes. Scarecrow, it's your turn.

2643
03:22:51,959 --> 03:22:56,225
H MICHAEL: Here's a question. I wanted to come to
the side because I wanted the element of surprise,

2644
03:22:56,225 --> 03:23:04,016
but now I'm the first to go. So is there a way to
hold until the ice boy has his back completely

2645
03:23:04,016 --> 03:23:05,474
turned to me?

2646
03:23:05,474 --> 03:23:07,446
SAM: His back is to you right now; he's not
looking out the window.

2647
03:23:07,446 --> 03:23:09,269
H MICHAEL: Does that give me an advantage?

2648
03:23:09,269 --> 03:23:12,604
SAM: Well, he won't see you. He may hear you as
you crash through the window.

2649
03:23:12,604 --> 03:23:14,518
H MICHAEL: That makes sense.

2650
03:23:14,518 --> 03:23:17,645
SAM: You won't be able to do anything from
outside.

2651
03:23:17,645 --> 03:23:19,930
H MICHAEL: Right. Oh, I'm still outside?

2652
03:23:19,930 --> 03:23:23,249
SAM: You're trying to get in. You tried on the
last roll and it didn't work.

2653
03:23:23,249 --> 03:23:28,332
H MICHAEL: Do I have room for an action and an
attack to try to break the glass, or is that

2654
03:23:28,332 --> 03:23:29,929
considered an attack?

2655
03:23:29,929 --> 03:23:31,793
SAM: You can use your action to break the glass,
sure.

2656
03:23:31,793 --> 03:23:34,434
H MICHAEL: So I'll try to break the glass.

2657
03:23:34,434 --> 03:23:37,212
SAM: Sure, go for it.

2658
03:23:37,212 --> 03:23:41,181
H MICHAEL: Oh shit. Four.

2659
03:23:41,181 --> 03:23:43,113
SAM: You rolled a four?

2660
03:23:43,113 --> 03:23:44,017
H MICHAEL: Yeah.

2661
03:23:44,017 --> 03:23:48,465
SAM: Take another attack because you get a bonus
action as monk, right?

2662
03:23:48,465 --> 03:23:50,964
H MICHAEL: That's for an attack, is that for--?

2663
03:23:50,964 --> 03:23:52,854
SAM: You're hitting it with your hand, yeah.

2664
03:23:52,854 --> 03:23:54,790
H MICHAEL: Eight plus two.

2665
03:23:54,790 --> 03:23:58,530
SAM: Yeah, you hit it. It's glass. Yes. Roll for
damage.

2666
03:23:58,530 --> 03:24:07,142
H MICHAEL: Three plus two. Five.

2667
03:24:07,142 --> 03:24:11,992
SAM: One pane shatters. You're trying to start
wiggling your way in and you get about halfway

2668
03:24:11,992 --> 03:24:13,273
in.

2669
03:24:13,273 --> 03:24:17,819
H MICHAEL: I'm going to use one of my darts on ice
guy from the outside.

2670
03:24:17,819 --> 03:24:20,825
SAM: Okay! Wait, those were your actions.

2671
03:24:20,825 --> 03:24:24,567
H MICHAEL: Okay, so that was my confusion because
I thought action and attack were different.

2672
03:24:24,567 --> 03:24:30,966
SAM: Action can be either attack or doing
something significant like trying to break a

2673
03:24:30,966 --> 03:24:38,136
window. But you need to get in there, so you did
good. You have your straw points that you can use

2674
03:24:38,136 --> 03:24:40,046
if you really wanted to.

2675
03:24:40,046 --> 03:24:44,283
H MICHAEL: I can't do much from outside. You know
what I'm going to do? For the rest of my turn,

2676
03:24:44,283 --> 03:24:48,939
I'll move one block over, out of sight, so you
can't attack.

2677
03:24:48,939 --> 03:24:51,330
SAM: You're staying outside, just out of range.

2678
03:24:51,330 --> 03:24:53,739
H MICHAEL: The window is slightly broken, but I'm
going to move slightly over.

2679
03:24:53,739 --> 03:25:00,094
SAM: Jack Frost turns around and hears something,
but doesn't see you. Great. That was your turn.

2680
03:25:00,094 --> 03:25:09,254
Second turn is Jack Frost. He does not see
Scarecrow, so instead he's going to move right

2681
03:25:09,254 --> 03:25:18,857
past Peter Pan who is this pack of Smarties, not
noticing him. He's going to attack with his ice

2682
03:25:18,857 --> 03:25:30,688
breath against you two. Shit, shit, shit! Frost
breath. Wendy and Mad Hatter.

2683
03:25:30,688 --> 03:25:34,317
AMY: I'm up by Beast on the coals.

2684
03:25:34,317 --> 03:25:35,865
SAM: Yeah.

2685
03:25:35,865 --> 03:25:37,743
YURI: We were holding hands, now we're not.

2686
03:25:37,743 --> 03:25:39,905
SAM: Make a dexterity saving throw.

2687
03:25:39,905 --> 03:25:41,701
YURI: You raged, I understand.

2688
03:25:41,701 --> 03:25:45,160
STEFANIE and YURI: 18.

2689
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:59,486
SAM: You both dodge out of most of the frosty
blast's range. You only take two points of damage

2690
03:25:59,486 --> 03:26:06,085
and you feel a chill come across you as ice coats
your eyebrows and makes you all shivery.

2691
03:26:06,085 --> 03:26:09,428
H MICHAEL: That's the worst, you guys.

2692
03:26:09,428 --> 03:26:19,394
SAM: That is his action and his movement and
that's it for him. Next is Peter Pan! What would

2693
03:26:19,394 --> 03:26:22,104
you like to do?

2694
03:26:22,104 --> 03:26:24,357
NOELLE: How far am I from Mr. Beast over there?

2695
03:26:24,357 --> 03:26:25,508
SAM: Far.

2696
03:26:25,508 --> 03:26:26,819
NOELLE: How far?

2697
03:26:26,819 --> 03:26:28,340
SAM: Like 40, 50 feet.

2698
03:26:28,340 --> 03:26:32,542
NOELLE: Okay. Is it 40 or 50? This is important.

2699
03:26:32,542 --> 03:26:38,771
SAM: Okay! 55.

2700
03:26:38,771 --> 03:26:40,306
NOELLE: 55? Well.

2701
03:26:40,306 --> 03:26:41,710
SAM: It's a big ass room.

2702
03:26:41,710 --> 03:26:51,922
NOELLE: It's a big ass room. I'm going to use my
Jump spell to go 48 feet.

2703
03:26:51,922 --> 03:26:54,592
SAM: 48 feet? Oh because it's your--

2704
03:26:54,592 --> 03:26:59,898
NOELLE: With a ten-foot head start, I'm going to
use Jump across the room.

2705
03:26:59,898 --> 03:27:10,788
SAM: As soon as this thing of gumdrops starts
moving, it jumps across. I think Disguise Self is

2706
03:27:10,788 --> 03:27:12,107
concentration?

2707
03:27:12,107 --> 03:27:13,073
NOELLE: Yeah, it is.

2708
03:27:13,073 --> 03:27:19,005
SAM: So you lose concentration and in mid-air
turns into a sort of flying Peter Pan. It kind of

2709
03:27:19,005 --> 03:27:23,315
looks like he's flying, he does a cool spin move
and he lands right here next to the Beast.

2710
03:27:23,315 --> 03:27:36,332
NOELLE: So I did that. Now I'm here and that's all
cool and good. I have an action left, yeah?

2711
03:27:36,332 --> 03:27:40,474
SAM: No, that was your action and your movement.
You have a bonus action! I don't know what you can

2712
03:27:40,474 --> 03:27:42,109
do as bonus.

2713
03:27:42,109 --> 03:27:51,084
NOELLE: I'm unfamiliar with playing a bard.

2714
03:27:51,084 --> 03:27:55,488
SAM: Bonus actions are usually healing things for
bards. You can inspire someone.

2715
03:27:55,488 --> 03:28:00,785
NOELLE: Who else is over here? The Queen of Hearts
is over here. I will use my bardic inspiration to

2716
03:28:00,785 --> 03:28:04,872
give the Queen of Hearts an extra 1d6 to an
ability check.

2717
03:28:04,872 --> 03:28:12,633
SAM: Peter looks over at you with fire burning in
his sort of handsome, small man eyes. He looks so

2718
03:28:12,633 --> 03:28:21,433
hot and sexy that the Queen shudders and swoons
and gets an extra d6 to her next roll. The next up

2719
03:28:21,433 --> 03:28:30,328
is the Beast. He's going to turn to you Peter and
take his first attack, rolled a natural one. He

2720
03:28:30,328 --> 03:28:34,037
bites at you, but you're so small and fast that he
misses.

2721
03:28:34,037 --> 03:28:36,965
YURI: And bites his cheek by accident! It hurts.

2722
03:28:36,965 --> 03:28:39,892
H MICHAEL: 45 damage, he's dead!

2723
03:28:39,892 --> 03:28:48,820
SAM: He takes his claw at you, rolls a seven and
it takes a chuff of hot coals and he misses you.

2724
03:28:48,820 --> 03:28:59,296
That is his turn. He's going to move, though. He's
going to move. No, he's not scared of you fuckers.

2725
03:28:59,296 --> 03:29:04,581
He's not going to move at all. He's going to stay
there and roar at you. (roars) That's his move.

2726
03:29:04,581 --> 03:29:06,874
That's the Beast. Next is Goldilocks.

2727
03:29:06,874 --> 03:29:13,855
STEFANIE: I'm going to ask Wendy. What is the
damage of your Amy Vorpahl sword?

2728
03:29:13,855 --> 03:29:15,735
MOLLY: You want it? I can't really use swords.

2729
03:29:15,735 --> 03:29:17,405
STEFANIE: Yeah, can I have it?

2730
03:29:17,405 --> 03:29:18,643
MOLLY: I toss it to you.

2731
03:29:18,643 --> 03:29:22,528
STEFANIE: I do, but if I get that, I can use a
second sword.

2732
03:29:22,528 --> 03:29:26,031
SAM: Sure, it's a shortsword, we'll say. Hey, what
was your initiative roll?

2733
03:29:26,031 --> 03:29:27,287
YURI: 18.

2734
03:29:27,287 --> 03:29:28,748
SAM: Shit, I skipped you.

2735
03:29:28,748 --> 03:29:30,379
YURI: We'll come back to me.

2736
03:29:30,379 --> 03:29:33,754
NOELLE: Hey, Sam, question. This is as a person,
not as a character. Can I have Skittles?

2737
03:29:33,754 --> 03:29:40,417
SAM: Yes, you can. That's Halloween candy. Sure,
go ahead.

2738
03:29:40,417 --> 03:29:43,577
H MICHAEL: I can't imagine it now that those are
gone.

2739
03:29:43,577 --> 03:29:48,244
YURI: You ruined everything! You've broken the
world.

2740
03:29:48,244 --> 03:29:50,717
STEFANIE: Should've shared your gorp.

2741
03:29:50,717 --> 03:29:54,543
SAM: You're asking for a sword, is that's what's
going on?

2742
03:29:54,543 --> 03:29:57,781
STEFANIE: Wendy says I may have the Vorpahl
sword.

2743
03:29:57,781 --> 03:30:01,655
MOLLY: I toss the Amy Vorpahl sword to you. Does
Amy say anything?

2744
03:30:01,655 --> 03:30:04,019
SAM: What does the Amy Vorpahl sword say?

2745
03:30:04,019 --> 03:30:07,358
STEFANIE: I receive it, oh, wow.

2746
03:30:07,358 --> 03:30:09,074
YURI: Not as a queen, not as a queen.

2747
03:30:09,074 --> 03:30:14,007
AMY: Not as a queen, I say: Aw man, yeah, new
friend, man. Kind of shafted by one, but you know,

2748
03:30:14,007 --> 03:30:15,699
you get a new one, that's life, man.

2749
03:30:15,699 --> 03:30:17,636
MOLLY: I don't know how to use swords.

2750
03:30:17,636 --> 03:30:19,602
STEFANIE: I say: damn, Vorpahl sword, you seem so
friendly.

2751
03:30:19,602 --> 03:30:21,489
AMY: Yeah, dude, you too.

2752
03:30:21,489 --> 03:30:23,670
STEFANIE: I'll stab the shit out of people with
you. Thanks.

2753
03:30:23,670 --> 03:30:26,563
AMY: This is how Goldilocks-- yeah!

2754
03:30:26,563 --> 03:30:30,838
SAM: All right, you've got a longsword and a
shortsword now, you're dual-wielding.

2755
03:30:30,838 --> 03:30:44,281
STEFANIE: I move towards Jack Frost, and then I
use my longsword attack but one-handed with the

2756
03:30:44,281 --> 03:30:47,423
longsword, so I can use the Vorpahl sword on the
other hand.

2757
03:30:47,423 --> 03:30:51,294
SAM: I'm gonna have to say that you used your bonus
action to catch that sword, so you get one attack

2758
03:30:51,294 --> 03:30:53,346
this round. You'll get two next round.

2759
03:30:53,346 --> 03:30:55,877
STEFANIE: Okay, so then I can only do one attack?

2760
03:30:55,877 --> 03:30:59,260
SAM: One attack this round, and you're holding two
swords, so it is a one-handed attack.

2761
03:30:59,260 --> 03:31:01,532
STEFANIE: So just with one hand, not two?

2762
03:31:01,532 --> 03:31:04,831
SAM: Yes. You do have some bonus surge-y thing, I
think.

2763
03:31:04,831 --> 03:31:08,491
STEFANIE: I have an action surge where I get one
extra action per day.

2764
03:31:08,491 --> 03:31:10,604
SAM: So you could have two hits, if you want.

2765
03:31:10,604 --> 03:31:12,565
STEFANIE: I'll do that, where I use the action
surge.

2766
03:31:12,565 --> 03:31:16,183
SAM: Action surge against Jack Frost, roll twice.

2767
03:31:16,183 --> 03:31:22,009
STEFANIE: Roll twice, so this one is for the
longsword. It's a 13 plus five.

2768
03:31:22,009 --> 03:31:24,179
SAM: You definitely hit.

2769
03:31:24,179 --> 03:31:29,471
STEFANIE: And now we use-- please be lucky. Five
plus two, seven.

2770
03:31:29,471 --> 03:31:32,180
SAM: You can use luck to re-roll that, right?
Aren't you lucky?

2771
03:31:32,180 --> 03:31:33,579
STEFANIE: I can.

2772
03:31:33,579 --> 03:31:35,495
AMY: That's a pretty good roll.

2773
03:31:35,495 --> 03:31:36,881
STEFANIE: We'll keep that seven.

2774
03:31:36,881 --> 03:31:40,595
SAM: Wait, what did you-- Oh, that's damage! Okay,
seven points, great. Thank you.

2775
03:31:40,595 --> 03:31:44,944
STEFANIE: Seven points damage and now, what's the
Vorpahl sword damage again?

2776
03:31:44,944 --> 03:31:46,664
AMY: Another d20.

2777
03:31:46,664 --> 03:31:51,818
SAM: Yeah, I don't know the stats of the Vorpahl
sword, but it's a standard shortsword. It's a d8

2778
03:31:51,818 --> 03:31:57,466
plus two? d6, we'll say d6.

2779
03:31:57,466 --> 03:31:58,665
STEFANIE: 15 plus--

2780
03:31:58,665 --> 03:32:02,963
SAM: Great, you hit, for sure. d6 plus two.

2781
03:32:02,963 --> 03:32:13,278
STEFANIE: d6 plus two, six plus two, eight! I
high-five my Vorpahl sword.

2782
03:32:13,278 --> 03:32:21,811
SAM: He is definitely injured, he snarls and
growls at you.

2783
03:32:21,811 --> 03:32:25,858
AMY: I say: we are slashin' in fashion.

2784
03:32:25,858 --> 03:32:31,356
STEFANIE: I wink at the Vorpahl sword. I say, you
get a piece of chocolate, Vorpahl sword.

2785
03:32:31,356 --> 03:32:34,075
H MICHAEL: Amy Vorpahl, your Amy Vorpahl
impression is so weird.

2786
03:32:34,075 --> 03:32:39,530
SAM: I skipped the Hatter, go ahead, Yuri, it's
your turn.

2787
03:32:39,530 --> 03:32:48,839
YURI: I'm going to cast a Scorching Ray at Jack
Frost and at the Beast.

2788
03:32:48,839 --> 03:32:52,362
SAM: Scorching Ray, what's the range?

2789
03:32:52,362 --> 03:32:54,165
YURI: It's 120 feet.

2790
03:32:54,165 --> 03:32:55,447
SAM: Oh, nice! And you can target two?

2791
03:32:55,447 --> 03:33:03,414
YURI: I can go up to three targets. So the Beast,
Jack Frost, and that Hershey's Bar back there.

2792
03:33:03,414 --> 03:33:06,432
SAM: You can target one guy twice, if you want.

2793
03:33:06,432 --> 03:33:07,803
YURI: Can you?

2794
03:33:07,803 --> 03:33:09,693
SAM: I think so, you can send two bolts to one
guy.

2795
03:33:09,693 --> 03:33:18,183
YURI: Jack Frost, Hershey bar, Jack Frost, Hershey
bar. Jack Frost gets two, the Beast gets one.

2796
03:33:18,183 --> 03:33:20,773
SAM: I think you roll a melee attack?

2797
03:33:20,773 --> 03:33:22,524
YURI: It's a ranged attack.

2798
03:33:22,524 --> 03:33:30,156
SAM: It's a ranged attack? So roll a d20 and add
your-- this thing, plus four.

2799
03:33:30,156 --> 03:33:32,500
YURI: Nine. I mean, I have to roll for each one.

2800
03:33:32,500 --> 03:33:34,530
SAM: Okay, roll two more times.

2801
03:33:34,530 --> 03:33:37,002
YURI: So the Beast doesn't get hit at all?

2802
03:33:37,002 --> 03:33:41,532
SAM: The first one misses the Beast and starts
melting the chocolate wall here.

2803
03:33:41,532 --> 03:33:45,951
YURI: You know, I'm still kind of okay with that.

2804
03:33:45,951 --> 03:33:47,568
AMY: I'm very impressed.

2805
03:33:47,568 --> 03:33:50,700
YURI: So, 12.

2806
03:33:50,700 --> 03:33:53,091
SAM: That's against the Beast?

2807
03:33:53,091 --> 03:33:55,499
YURI: No, these last two are against Jack Frost.

2808
03:33:55,499 --> 03:33:58,078
SAM: Jack Frost? That hits Jack Frost. Roll for
damage.

2809
03:33:58,078 --> 03:34:03,309
YURI: Great, and that-- I looked it up, and I
forget. And it's--

2810
03:34:03,309 --> 03:34:07,239
SAM: I might have it here somewhere.

2811
03:34:07,239 --> 03:34:17,298
YURI: 2d6, nine. And then there is a second ray.

2812
03:34:17,298 --> 03:34:22,414
SAM: As you fire against Jack Frost, he opens his
mouth to blast you with ice, but your fire bolt

2813
03:34:22,414 --> 03:34:32,317
enters his mouth and his head explodes, killing
him instantly. Jack Frost is dead.

2814
03:34:32,317 --> 03:34:34,235
YURI: That happened.

2815
03:34:34,235 --> 03:34:38,416
SAM: Where would you like to attack next?

2816
03:34:38,416 --> 03:34:40,204
YURI: I get another attack?

2817
03:34:40,204 --> 03:34:41,764
SAM: Well, it's three bolts, right?

2818
03:34:41,764 --> 03:34:49,784
YURI: Yeah, well, the Beast again. No, the Hershey
bar! No, the Beast. You know what? The Mad Hatter

2819
03:34:49,784 --> 03:34:51,545
would attack the Hershey bar.

2820
03:34:51,545 --> 03:34:57,119
SAM: The Hershey bar melts, and this whole side of
the wall starts to collapse as well.

2821
03:34:57,119 --> 03:34:59,291
YURI: Chicory-chic-chola-chola.

2822
03:34:59,291 --> 03:35:04,381
SAM: Any bonus actions? Any movements? Do you want
to get closer to anybody?

2823
03:35:04,381 --> 03:35:06,170
YURI: I'll move towards the Beast.

2824
03:35:06,170 --> 03:35:10,189
SAM: Okay, I don't know how I'm supposed to move,
let's see here. Great. Okay, that was Hatter. We

2825
03:35:10,189 --> 03:35:15,392
also did-- Goldilocks moved already, right? So
we're to Wendy Darling.

2826
03:35:15,392 --> 03:35:18,586
MOLLY: Cool. So the Beast is the only enemy in
this room?

2827
03:35:18,586 --> 03:35:21,300
SAM: That you can see.

2828
03:35:21,300 --> 03:35:23,622
NOELLE: (gasps, whispers) Who's that?

2829
03:35:23,622 --> 03:35:36,573
MOLLY: I'm going to walk as close to the Beast as
I can. 30 feet. With one move, 30 feet. And say,

2830
03:35:36,573 --> 03:35:41,867
hey buddy, I'm sure we can work this all out. And
I'm going to cast Charm Person. So he has to make

2831
03:35:41,867 --> 03:35:45,229
a wisdom saving throw.

2832
03:35:45,229 --> 03:35:47,680
SAM: Great. Let's do it. Against your spell DC
of?

2833
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:49,181
MOLLY: Against 13.

2834
03:35:49,181 --> 03:35:50,643
SAM: It's 13?

2835
03:35:50,643 --> 03:35:52,809
MOLLY: Yeah. I don't know why it's so bad.

2836
03:35:52,809 --> 03:35:56,283
SAM: Beast wisdom saving throw. He rolled a 13.
What does that mean?

2837
03:35:56,283 --> 03:35:59,393
NOELLE and AMY: He beats it.

2838
03:35:59,393 --> 03:36:03,465
SAM: He beats it. Thank you, Amy. He shakes off
the charm. It does not work. I'm so sorry.

2839
03:36:03,465 --> 03:36:10,950
MOLLY: Oh no. That's okay. Yeah, he has advantage
anyway because we're fighting against him. Well, I

2840
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:15,845
gave it a shot. Can I make a perception check,
too?

2841
03:36:15,845 --> 03:36:18,086
SAM: Sure. As your bonus action, why not? You're
looking around. Roll a perception check.

2842
03:36:18,086 --> 03:36:23,988
MOLLY: That's a 21.

2843
03:36:23,988 --> 03:36:30,886
SAM: Okay. You definitely see, lurking in the
shadows back there, a large, large guy. He's a--

2844
03:36:30,886 --> 03:36:37,229
the camera can't see, but there's a big green guy
over there lurking in the chocolate.

2845
03:36:37,463 --> 03:36:39,367
MOLLY: Okay. Can I warn my friends or--

2846
03:36:39,367 --> 03:36:40,678
SAM: Sure. Go ahead.

2847
03:36:40,678 --> 03:36:45,347
MOLLY: Yeah. In the corner with the chocolate!
It's big and green!

2848
03:36:45,347 --> 03:36:50,160
SAM: There's four corners of chocolate. Nobody
knows where he is.

2849
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:54,309
MOLLY: Wendy's not very good at communication.

2850
03:36:54,309 --> 03:36:56,879
AMY: The candy! Look for the candy!

2851
03:36:56,879 --> 03:36:59,896
NOELLE: Thank you for finally admitting that. Oh
my god.

2852
03:36:59,896 --> 03:37:11,366
SAM: From out of nowhere, this crazy character
comes in and you hear a (pipe sounds). You get the

2853
03:37:11,366 --> 03:37:18,535
sense that this guy usually plays pipes to do
things to people and he's going to target the

2854
03:37:18,535 --> 03:37:23,047
Queen. He's going to cast--

2855
03:37:23,047 --> 03:37:30,208
NOELLE: Is he small? Is he a tiny man?

2856
03:37:30,208 --> 03:37:42,298
SAM: He is a half-elf. He's going to cast Crown of
Madness against you. You have to roll a save. It's

2857
03:37:42,298 --> 03:37:45,019
a wisdom save, right? I think it's wisdom.

2858
03:37:45,019 --> 03:37:53,541
AMY: Wisdom isn't my best trait, so (singing) come
on baby, be good to me! Awesome! Okay, 18 with no

2859
03:37:53,541 --> 03:37:55,863
modifier!

2860
03:37:55,863 --> 03:38:00,598
SAM: Okay. You feel the urge to hit one of your
own friends. But in that moment, you shake the

2861
03:38:00,598 --> 03:38:11,563
urge off and you're back, focused on the Beast. It
does not work. As a bonus action, the Pied Piper

2862
03:38:11,563 --> 03:38:17,463
plays a jaunty little ditty which makes the Beast
oh-so-happy and inspired. Okay, that is his turn.

2863
03:38:17,463 --> 03:38:29,553
Let me roll for the troll. The troll will be in
order next. So that is the top of the round. Who

2864
03:38:29,553 --> 03:38:33,190
is first? Scarecrow and Queen of Hearts. You guys
are up.

2865
03:38:33,190 --> 03:38:34,663
H MICHAEL: As always, I defer.

2866
03:38:34,663 --> 03:38:42,504
AMY: Awesome. So what is my perception-- oh, who
cares? I'm raging. So I don't care. I don't care

2867
03:38:42,504 --> 03:38:49,829
what anyone's doing to the Beast. I am running
right up to him and smacking him with my scepter

2868
03:38:49,829 --> 03:38:52,515
twice! In my frenzy--

2869
03:38:52,515 --> 03:38:54,994
SAM: Roll for attack twice.

2870
03:38:54,994 --> 03:38:59,725
AMY: I'm also recklessly attacking with this. Next
time, he can advantage on me, but right now, I

2871
03:38:59,725 --> 03:39:04,616
also get advantage on him. So does an 18 hit?

2872
03:39:04,616 --> 03:39:06,300
SAM: An 18 hits, yes.

2873
03:39:06,300 --> 03:39:11,211
AMY: And does a-- oh, higher than that. 21.

2874
03:39:11,211 --> 03:39:12,303
SAM: Yes, that hits.

2875
03:39:12,303 --> 03:39:24,632
AMY: Perfect! Then I shall do-- that is 12 plus
12. 24 damage on that. So I run across the coals

2876
03:39:24,632 --> 03:39:34,016
and I smack him once right in the ribcage, and as
I spin around, I smack him right in the shoulder.

2877
03:39:34,016 --> 03:39:36,259
And I yell, give me love!

2878
03:39:36,259 --> 03:39:37,848
(laughter)

2879
03:39:37,848 --> 03:39:42,578
SAM: The Beast is stunned by this crazy madwoman
who just dashed through fiery coals to hit him

2880
03:39:42,578 --> 03:39:47,368
twice. He's super pissed off. He snarls at you.
Scarecrow, it's your turn.

2881
03:39:47,368 --> 03:39:51,546
H MICHAEL: I have this opening in the window, so I
want to open the window.

2882
03:39:51,546 --> 03:39:53,004
SAM: Sure. You can open the window.

2883
03:39:53,004 --> 03:40:00,959
H MICHAEL: And I'd like to drop down and use my 40
feet of movement to move to the center of the

2884
03:40:00,959 --> 03:40:02,093
room.

2885
03:40:02,093 --> 03:40:08,433
SAM: Okay, so it takes ten feet to get down and
then we'll say you get to about there.

2886
03:40:08,433 --> 03:40:13,595
H MICHAEL: Great. And then I have-- my dart's
range. It says 20/60. What does that mean?

2887
03:40:13,595 --> 03:40:17,694
SAM: You can throw it 20 feet, no problem. If you
throw at 60 feet, you have to roll with

2888
03:40:17,694 --> 03:40:28,318
disadvantage to hit. So you can hit him, but
you've got to roll with disadvantage. We'll say

2889
03:40:28,318 --> 03:40:31,050
you can just barely hit that guy.

2890
03:40:31,050 --> 03:40:33,069
H MICHAEL: Why not? I'll huck a fucking dart at
this motherfucker.

2891
03:40:33,069 --> 03:40:37,177
SAM: So roll twice. Take the lower of the two.

2892
03:40:37,177 --> 03:40:38,755
H MICHAEL: With my d20?

2893
03:40:38,755 --> 03:40:40,054
SAM: Yes.

2894
03:40:40,054 --> 03:40:45,286
H MICHAEL: Two and a 15. So I'll take a four.

2895
03:40:45,286 --> 03:40:53,318
SAM: The dart sails up into the air and falls
right about here. Just kind of shy. Your arms are

2896
03:40:53,318 --> 03:40:56,010
not made of muscle. They are straw. They can't
throw very hard.

2897
03:40:56,010 --> 03:40:59,608
H MICHAEL: Is there anything else I can do?

2898
03:40:59,608 --> 03:41:03,523
SAM: You have bonus. Any bonus-y type of action-y
or special move?

2899
03:41:03,523 --> 03:41:15,901
H MICHAEL: Not much. It doesn't say how far I can
menace.

2900
03:41:15,901 --> 03:41:20,540
SAM: Menace would be an action, not a bonus
action, I believe.

2901
03:41:20,540 --> 03:41:28,832
H MICHAEL: That makes sense. Okay, I just go:
sorry, guys! Window was a super bad idea! My heart

2902
03:41:28,832 --> 03:41:31,704
was in the right place. Wish I'd been more
helpful.

2903
03:41:31,704 --> 03:41:38,330
SAM: Hatter, you're up. Oh, you could also use an
item, by the way, if you need it. I don't know

2904
03:41:38,330 --> 03:41:39,805
what else you have, but you could--

2905
03:41:39,805 --> 03:41:41,036
NOELLE: Suspenders?

2906
03:41:41,036 --> 03:41:43,821
SAM: (laughs) You flick your suspenders. Hatter,
you're up.

2907
03:41:43,821 --> 03:41:48,498
H MICHAEL: Then in that case, I'll take a nibble
of one of my pieces of granola from my chest

2908
03:41:48,498 --> 03:41:49,543
pouch.

2909
03:41:49,543 --> 03:41:50,899
SAM: Great.

2910
03:41:50,899 --> 03:41:52,910
NOELLE: It's so nutritious, wow!

2911
03:41:52,910 --> 03:41:54,865
H MICHAEL: Have a nice little snack.

2912
03:41:54,865 --> 03:42:03,995
YURI: I'm going to cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter
at the Beast.

2913
03:42:03,995 --> 03:42:09,564
SAM: You probably just need to get a little bit
closer. Is it 60 or 30? Doesn't matter. You get

2914
03:42:09,564 --> 03:42:14,464
close enough to do it. You're fine. Go ahead.
Versus a wisdom saving throw. What's your

2915
03:42:14,464 --> 03:42:17,087
spellcasting ability? It's 13, I think.

2916
03:42:17,087 --> 03:42:18,755
YURI: 13. Yes.

2917
03:42:18,755 --> 03:42:20,382
SAM: He rolled a seven. He does not--

2918
03:42:20,382 --> 03:42:23,628
AMY: Yeah! The Beast, it sucks! (laughs)

2919
03:42:23,628 --> 03:42:29,276
SAM: Yes. He looks at this strange, funny little
man wearing a funny little hat and he can't help

2920
03:42:29,276 --> 03:42:39,632
it. He's overcome with the giggles. He starts
laughing and he cannot stop. I'm looking up

2921
03:42:39,632 --> 03:42:46,317
Tasha's Hideous Laughter right now to find out
what happens. So the range is 30 feet, so have to

2922
03:42:46,317 --> 03:42:52,283
come a little closer for that. It's okay. You did
it. You're concentrating on it. He's just rolling

2923
03:42:52,283 --> 03:43:02,280
with laughter, slapping his knees, and he falls
prone and is unable to stand up.

2924
03:43:02,280 --> 03:43:06,181
YURI: Hilarious.

2925
03:43:06,181 --> 03:43:10,290
AMY: In my rage, I look at you and my eyes are
just hearts.

2926
03:43:10,290 --> 03:43:12,601
YURI: Heart binoculars.

2927
03:43:12,601 --> 03:43:17,248
AMY: Heart binoculars. Yeah, badoinga.

2928
03:43:17,248 --> 03:43:23,185
SAM: Badoinga. Okay, that was the Hatter. We're
down to-- Jack Frost is dead. Peter Pan!

2929
03:43:23,185 --> 03:43:30,614
NOELLE: This will make it easier now that he is
prone. So I imagine I get some sort of advantage

2930
03:43:30,614 --> 03:43:38,475
or he gets disadvantage. I want to leap forward
and pour my Philter of Love down his throat.

2931
03:43:38,475 --> 03:43:42,424
AMY: Philter of Love? That's what you have?

2932
03:43:42,424 --> 03:43:43,774
NOELLE: I have that.

2933
03:43:43,774 --> 03:43:46,291
SAM: You're going to pour the Philter of Love down
the Beast's throat.

2934
03:43:46,291 --> 03:43:48,032
NOELLE: Yes! While staring into his eyes.

2935
03:43:48,032 --> 03:43:52,519
SAM: Okay. What is the-- did I write down the
spell DC?

2936
03:43:52,519 --> 03:43:56,379
NOELLE: After drinking this, you, meaning the
person who partakes of the beverage, become

2937
03:43:56,379 --> 03:44:01,686
charmed by the first person you see for one hour.
If they are a species and gender you are attracted

2938
03:44:01,686 --> 03:44:03,658
to, you regard it as true love.

2939
03:44:03,658 --> 03:44:05,166
MOLLY: Oh my god.

2940
03:44:05,166 --> 03:44:08,792
YURI: Guys, she just used love.

2941
03:44:08,792 --> 03:44:16,999
SAM: It just works.

2942
03:44:16,999 --> 03:44:23,022
NOELLE: The spell just works. I was preparing to
do an acrobatics check or anything, but since he

2943
03:44:23,022 --> 03:44:24,188
is prone--

2944
03:44:24,188 --> 03:44:32,649
SAM: The Beast is confused. He's laughing
hysterically, so his mouth is open. There is a

2945
03:44:32,649 --> 03:44:39,170
thick, viscous liquid being poured down his
gullet. He looks at you with strange eyes. He

2946
03:44:39,170 --> 03:44:51,061
doesn't like the taste. He snarls at you and
growls, and turns around to the Queen and smiles

2947
03:44:51,061 --> 03:44:52,704
with love.

2948
03:44:52,704 --> 03:44:55,606
AMY: I have so many emotions right now.

2949
03:44:55,606 --> 03:45:02,069
SAM: --and starts purring at you. He's not wearing
any clothing. You can see, visibly--

2950
03:45:02,069 --> 03:45:04,478
NOELLE: Wait, how long has he not been wearing any
clothing?

2951
03:45:04,478 --> 03:45:10,941
SAM: Always! He's a beast! Oh wait, no, he's
wearing a pink leisure suit. Underneath his pink

2952
03:45:10,941 --> 03:45:20,779
leisure suit, you see a little bulge forming on
his nethers. He is charmed, and now he's in love

2953
03:45:20,779 --> 03:45:22,081
with you.

2954
03:45:22,081 --> 03:45:25,936
NOELLE: I'm going to use my bonus action to step
away. And you still have your bardic inspiration

2955
03:45:25,936 --> 03:45:28,249
from me, if I am not mistaken, so have at it!

2956
03:45:28,249 --> 03:45:33,761
SAM: Okay, it is now the Beast's turn. Even though
he fucking loves you--

2957
03:45:33,761 --> 03:45:36,163
YURI: He used his boner action already, though.

2958
03:45:36,163 --> 03:45:45,754
SAM: --he's going to try to stop laughing. He
definitely stops laughing. The feeling of love

2959
03:45:45,754 --> 03:45:51,802
overcomes him and he shakes off the laughter. He
uses half his movement to stand up. He takes his

2960
03:45:51,802 --> 03:46:02,026
giant claws and takes a big, sweeping swing, not
at you, but turning around and sweeping to attack

2961
03:46:02,026 --> 03:46:04,386
Peter Pan, right there.

2962
03:46:04,386 --> 03:46:06,107
NOELLE: I would do anything for love.

2963
03:46:06,107 --> 03:46:14,541
SAM: Yes. He rolls a one. He misses! He's very
confused right now. He tries to bite you. Oh, yes.

2964
03:46:14,541 --> 03:46:19,888
He rolls a 20. He definitely bites you. Vicious
teeth sink into you.

2965
03:46:19,888 --> 03:46:21,418
NOELLE: Okay. Buy me dinner first!

2966
03:46:21,418 --> 03:46:28,516
SAM: You take, okay, hold on. You take six points
of bite damage.

2967
03:46:28,516 --> 03:46:32,825
NOELLE: That's fine, I'll absorb that. It's worth
it for true love.

2968
03:46:32,825 --> 03:46:36,758
SAM: And he is super pissed off. Yes.

2969
03:46:36,758 --> 03:46:43,340
NOELLE: Queen, it's your time. This is your
moment. Go for it.

2970
03:46:43,340 --> 03:46:49,898
SAM: He sort of stands, in a way that is
protecting the Queen of Hearts, with his back to

2971
03:46:49,898 --> 03:47:00,749
her. He says, "Don't worry. You'll be safe behind
me." Next up is the troll. No, it's Goldilocks.

2972
03:47:00,749 --> 03:47:03,004
Goldilocks is next. Go ahead, Goldie.

2973
03:47:03,004 --> 03:47:10,554
STEFANIE: Well, first, I call out to Wendy and
say, hey, if you turn into a bird, you should pick

2974
03:47:10,554 --> 03:47:16,191
me up and drop me off somewhere close to people,
where I can use my Thunderwave.

2975
03:47:16,191 --> 03:47:18,740
MOLLY: Just walk!

2976
03:47:18,740 --> 03:47:22,967
(laughter)

2977
03:47:22,967 --> 03:47:29,039
MOLLY: It's not that far!

2978
03:47:29,039 --> 03:47:35,944
STEFANIE: Fine! I'll get there, but I only have 30
steps, just saying. If the people in whatever

2979
03:47:35,944 --> 03:47:42,202
corner, because you couldn't specify, if you
happened to remember which corner they are, feel

2980
03:47:42,202 --> 03:47:48,711
free to pick me up and drop me off near one of
those corners. Anyway, then I take my movement.

2981
03:47:48,711 --> 03:47:54,467
SAM: So you take your movement. As you go, you see
one of the ice sculptures, Geppetto, is

2982
03:47:54,467 --> 03:48:00,638
desperately trying to break out of his ice. He's
trying to talk to you in his thick Italian accent,

2983
03:48:00,638 --> 03:48:11,035
which I am going to attempt. "Hey! La dolce! Don't
you see? He just wants love!" Okay, that's all he

2984
03:48:11,035 --> 03:48:12,992
says as you walk by him.

2985
03:48:12,992 --> 03:48:21,998
STEFANIE: Goldilocks says, I really loved playing
Mario as a kid, so you are just adorable,

2986
03:48:21,998 --> 03:48:33,628
Geppetto. Is there anything I can do to help you
out of your misery?

2987
03:48:33,628 --> 03:48:40,201
SAM: I like how you're having a calm, casual
conversation. "Don't worry about me! Just soothe

2988
03:48:40,201 --> 03:48:43,130
"the Beast with love!"

2989
03:48:43,130 --> 03:48:49,218
STEFANIE: With love, awesome! I'll use my very
high, well, low charisma. We'll charm the Beast.

2990
03:48:49,218 --> 03:48:53,084
Don't you worry, Geppetto. So that's as far as I
go, right?

2991
03:48:53,084 --> 03:48:54,645
SAM: You can get a little further.

2992
03:48:54,645 --> 03:48:56,944
STEFANIE: Yeah, the closest I can possibly get.

2993
03:48:56,944 --> 03:48:59,398
SAM: The heat from the coals is starting to burn
your face.

2994
03:48:59,398 --> 03:49:06,931
STEFANIE: This can only be used if I'm close, or
not?

2995
03:49:06,931 --> 03:49:08,551
AMY: That is a touch attack, yeah.

2996
03:49:08,551 --> 03:49:17,831
STEFANIE: Yeah, so I'll use my crossbow and aim
toward the Beast.

2997
03:49:17,831 --> 03:49:20,208
SAM: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack.

2998
03:49:20,208 --> 03:49:23,607
STEFANIE: 15 plus four, 19!

2999
03:49:23,607 --> 03:49:25,911
SAM: You definitely hit. Roll for damage.

3000
03:49:25,911 --> 03:49:31,073
STEFANIE: Awesome. We'll use the precious. Three.

3001
03:49:31,073 --> 03:49:39,112
SAM: Plus something? Two, maybe? Great, awesome.
That's some damage. "Argh!" Your crossbow bolt

3002
03:49:39,112 --> 03:49:47,023
buries itself into his thigh. He writhes in pain,
but he still loves you. Next up is Wendy Darling.

3003
03:49:47,023 --> 03:49:57,107
MOLLY: Oh, really? Nice. Okay. I'm pissed off,
tired of not doing anything, so I'm going to raise

3004
03:49:57,107 --> 03:50:02,705
my arms and conjure a Flaming Sphere directly on
the troll, which apparently no one else can see.

3005
03:50:02,705 --> 03:50:06,941
So I think I can do it, because it's got a range
of 60 feet and it looks like he's about 60 feet

3006
03:50:06,941 --> 03:50:10,174
away. He has to make a dexterity saving throw.

3007
03:50:10,174 --> 03:50:16,606
SAM: Let me see what he does. This guy's dead. Oh,
this guy's huge. His saving throw is a two. He

3008
03:50:16,606 --> 03:50:18,432
does not resist it at all.

3009
03:50:18,432 --> 03:50:30,091
MOLLY: Okay. Hell yeah! Got a 12. That was max
damage. So yeah, he takes 12 fire damage. It's

3010
03:50:30,091 --> 03:50:32,254
basically burning there.

3011
03:50:32,254 --> 03:50:40,073
SAM: So the fire starts to melt the candy piles
around him. He starts to slowly sink into the

3012
03:50:40,073 --> 03:50:41,436
candy floor.

3013
03:50:41,436 --> 03:50:47,328
MOLLY: It's a five-foot-diameter sphere, by the
way.

3014
03:50:47,328 --> 03:50:52,425
SAM: He's considered grappled here, by the
chocolate.

3015
03:50:52,425 --> 03:50:58,391
MOLLY: It shines bright light in a 20-foot radius,
by the way, so if there's anyone else hiding

3016
03:50:58,391 --> 03:51:01,764
around here, they're all revealed.

3017
03:51:01,764 --> 03:51:07,112
SAM: (troll noises) "You didn't even find out if I
was nice or not!"

3018
03:51:07,112 --> 03:51:14,452
STEFANIE: Wait, can we perception to see? Oh my
god!

3019
03:51:14,452 --> 03:51:18,124
SAM: He seems to have blood all over him. It's
probably okay.

3020
03:51:18,124 --> 03:51:22,905
MOLLY: I'm going to run over here because, Peter,
you took a hit. I'm going to yell, You okay?

3021
03:51:22,905 --> 03:51:26,019
NOELLE: I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

3022
03:51:26,019 --> 03:51:28,980
SAM: Ooh, so proud. Okay.

3023
03:51:28,980 --> 03:51:31,348
NOELLE: Dying will be an awfully big adventure.

3024
03:51:31,348 --> 03:51:39,092
MOLLY: I have Cure Wounds! You don't have to go
there yet! I have a Cure Wounds spell!

3025
03:51:39,092 --> 03:51:49,542
SAM: The Pied Piper is up. The Pied Piper starts
playing a stupid fucking flute. (flute dooting)

3026
03:51:49,542 --> 03:52:00,295
He's going to try to charm you, Hatter. Yes. His
DC is 13. Make a wisdom saving throw.

3027
03:52:00,295 --> 03:52:06,961
YURI: So, a four.

3028
03:52:06,961 --> 03:52:17,316
SAM: Yep, okay. You suddenly have this unbreakable
desire to do harm to the closest ally near you.

3029
03:52:17,316 --> 03:52:24,821
You turn to the Scarecrow, fire in your eyes.

3030
03:52:24,821 --> 03:52:30,745
H MICHAEL: Hey, how are you doing? Pretty crazy
we're in this big fire, right? But at least we

3031
03:52:30,745 --> 03:52:32,982
have each other!

3032
03:52:32,982 --> 03:52:36,289
YURI: You are so stupid!

3033
03:52:36,289 --> 03:52:45,559
SAM: And the Pied Piper is going to give a little
healing to his friend, the Beast. Okay. That's the

3034
03:52:45,559 --> 03:52:51,478
Piper's turn. Troll is going to try to break the
grapple. He succeeds. Bursts out of the chocolate!

3035
03:52:51,478 --> 03:52:54,310
Rargh! That's his action.

3036
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:56,439
STEFANIE: Does he end his turn there?

3037
03:52:56,439 --> 03:53:05,893
MOLLY: He takes more damage. Four damage. Well,
the Flaming Sphere is still present in the

3038
03:53:05,893 --> 03:53:07,219
situation.

3039
03:53:07,219 --> 03:53:13,778
SAM: Next round, Scarecrow and the Queen of Hearts
are up. Right at the top of the round, Scarecrow,

3040
03:53:13,778 --> 03:53:21,016
you're close to Geppetto also. Geppetto is
desperately, "Don't you see? He just needs love!"

3041
03:53:21,016 --> 03:53:30,611
H MICHAEL: The blood vision has taken over. I'm so
furious at the Mad Hatter for this verbal insult.

3042
03:53:30,611 --> 03:53:39,076
Right to the quick. But a part of me knows, I've
learned from attacking a friend, getting into a

3043
03:53:39,076 --> 03:53:45,766
physical altercation with a friend. And so--
Absolutely, I'm focused on the Queen of Hearts at

3044
03:53:45,766 --> 03:53:50,068
this moment. Because she hasn't tried to steal
anything out of my body!

3045
03:53:50,068 --> 03:53:54,491
AMY: Queen of Hearts is getting it!

3046
03:53:54,491 --> 03:54:03,723
H MICHAEL: So I'm going to-- Now, there's no way
for me to know how long the Pied Piper's effects

3047
03:54:03,723 --> 03:54:05,341
are going to last?

3048
03:54:05,341 --> 03:54:08,491
SAM: No, you have no idea what's going on. You
just saw the Mad Hatter turn to you and smile.

3049
03:54:08,491 --> 03:54:14,915
STEFANIE: Goldilocks takes a second to yell to
Scarecrow, hey, I don't believe in love anymore,

3050
03:54:14,915 --> 03:54:21,099
but I know you're not stupid. I know you're
smart.

3051
03:54:21,099 --> 03:54:24,503
H MICHAEL: That's nice. You're still in the
doghouse as far as I'm concerned, but thank you.

3052
03:54:24,503 --> 03:54:33,382
Okay, so I think I'm going to keep more people
from being put under this spell. I'm going to use

3053
03:54:33,382 --> 03:54:36,519
menacing against the Pied Piper.

3054
03:54:36,519 --> 03:54:41,841
SAM: Okay, go for it. Yes, roll, and he's going to
roll against it.

3055
03:54:41,841 --> 03:54:49,294
H MICHAEL: Let's see. So, 20.

3056
03:54:49,294 --> 03:55:00,079
SAM: He rolled an 18. He is scared of you, very
scared. He sees a weird straw man with granola

3057
03:55:00,079 --> 03:55:01,867
dribbling out of his chest.

3058
03:55:01,867 --> 03:55:04,704
YURI: That is basically your purpose in life. You
just fulfilled your purpose in life.

3059
03:55:04,704 --> 03:55:07,051
SAM: Do you rip your head apart?

3060
03:55:07,051 --> 03:55:15,556
H MICHAEL: No, this time I open my mouth like a
snake. My jaw pops down and the worst, wettest

3061
03:55:15,556 --> 03:55:19,950
straw from the inside of me rolls out like awful
gray spaghetti onto the ground.

3062
03:55:19,950 --> 03:55:23,005
AMY: You are a Guillermo del Toro character.

3063
03:55:23,005 --> 03:55:31,909
SAM: He's watching this happen, playing his flute,
and his jaw drops. His flute drops. He's so

3064
03:55:31,909 --> 03:55:38,833
confused. The eyes of the Hatter flash back to
life. He is fine again.

3065
03:55:38,833 --> 03:55:43,476
YURI: You're not stupid! I love you! You're
the smartest person I know!

3066
03:55:43,476 --> 03:55:51,661
SAM: All right, so he is frightened of you now.
Intimidated by you.

3067
03:55:51,661 --> 03:55:53,531
H MICHAEL: This menacing shit is the tits.

3068
03:55:53,531 --> 03:55:57,504
SAM: Really is. Okay, so that's Scarecrow. Queen
of Hearts?

3069
03:55:57,504 --> 03:56:05,373
AMY: I see the Beast attacking my friend, Peter,
and I also know that I might have a little bit of

3070
03:56:05,373 --> 03:56:14,281
power, but I'm still angry. So I shake him and I
say, hey you! Get over here! And I very angrily

3071
03:56:14,281 --> 03:56:20,717
grapple him and I try to grab him. Yeah, I'm going
to grapple him. I don't know if he would even

3072
03:56:20,717 --> 03:56:22,657
resist, but we'll see.

3073
03:56:22,657 --> 03:56:26,210
SAM: He's not resisting. He lets it happen. He's
in this weird hug.

3074
03:56:26,210 --> 03:56:32,229
AMY: Yes, it's just as awkward as it was with the
Scarecrow. My legs are not where they need to be and

3075
03:56:32,229 --> 03:56:34,819
I restrain him as well, so he's also restrained.

3076
03:56:34,819 --> 03:56:39,360
SAM: He gives into it and he's hugging you back
with a very loving, caring hug.

3077
03:56:39,360 --> 03:56:43,877
AMY: Okay, and I do the thing that I feel is
right, and I try to find a spot on his enormous

3078
03:56:43,877 --> 03:56:46,312
mouth lip to kiss.

3079
03:56:46,312 --> 03:56:47,912
SAM: You're going in for a kiss?

3080
03:56:47,912 --> 03:56:50,753
AMY: But an angry, rageful kiss.

3081
03:56:50,753 --> 03:56:53,147
SAM: Okay, that's the best kind.

3082
03:56:53,147 --> 03:56:58,643
H MICHAEL: Is that the best kind? What have your
relationships been like?

3083
03:56:58,643 --> 03:57:07,334
SAM: Let's see here. He's shaking, there's a lot
going on. Let's say that this is, what kind of a

3084
03:57:07,334 --> 03:57:13,003
check is this? A kiss check! How about an animal
handling check?

3085
03:57:13,003 --> 03:57:15,615
YURI: That makes sense.

3086
03:57:15,615 --> 03:57:20,557
AMY: This is a straight zero modifier for me. It's
an 11.

3087
03:57:20,557 --> 03:57:30,804
SAM: Okay, he's not resisting, so really this is
just so you can find his mouth. So you kind of

3088
03:57:30,804 --> 03:57:36,088
climb up on him a little. He's ten feet tall, so
you climb up on him with your rage strength going,

3089
03:57:36,088 --> 03:57:42,516
your bulging biceps. You use his fur to pull up
and you kiss him on the lips. He's confused. He

3090
03:57:42,516 --> 03:57:49,627
withdraws for a second, but then you can feel his
body relaxing and giving in to it. He kisses you

3091
03:57:49,627 --> 03:58:02,588
back, his black tongue sliding into your mouth.
He's really going at it with you. You can smell

3092
03:58:02,588 --> 03:58:10,110
rotten meat, and you can kind of see some of
Captain Hook's hair right here at the corner of

3093
03:58:10,110 --> 03:58:11,491
his mouth.

3094
03:58:11,491 --> 03:58:17,009
STEFANIE: I take this moment to shout out, and I
say, hey, hey, Geppetto said he just wants love.

3095
03:58:17,009 --> 03:58:18,918
Just saying.

3096
03:58:18,918 --> 03:58:25,219
AMY: Copy that! I'm taking him for the team!

3097
03:58:25,219 --> 03:58:31,944
SAM: Do you kiss him back? Are you in it?

3098
03:58:31,944 --> 03:58:34,044
AMY: I mean, how many times do I have to kiss?

3099
03:58:34,044 --> 03:58:37,401
SAM: No, I mean, are you resisting, or are you in
it?

3100
03:58:37,401 --> 03:58:43,549
AMY: I am letting-- This was the goal, so it's
going better/worse than I thought. The main thing

3101
03:58:43,549 --> 03:58:48,535
is to turn his attention away from my friends and
onto me, who I am very confident that he won't

3102
03:58:48,535 --> 03:58:51,890
hurt. So yeah, I am letting it, very much.

3103
03:58:51,890 --> 03:58:58,610
SAM: The kiss continues for an uncomfortable
amount of time.

3104
03:58:58,610 --> 03:59:05,559
AMY: I do what I think I should and kind of grope
at his tummy. Oh, well, I don't know if I can

3105
03:59:05,559 --> 03:59:07,138
reach around his entire--

3106
03:59:07,138 --> 03:59:14,373
SAM: His tummy's good. He's got rippling 12-pack
abs and he's flexing for you, because he really

3107
03:59:14,373 --> 03:59:23,178
likes you. He's getting more into it. You're
getting more into it. Weirdly, it looks romantic,

3108
03:59:23,178 --> 03:59:29,759
lit by the coal light, the red coal light. There
is dripping chocolate on the walls behind you.

3109
03:59:29,759 --> 03:59:35,931
There's a piper playing weird, dissonant music.
It's the weirdest romantic--

3110
03:59:35,931 --> 03:59:38,011
YURI: Basically the most romantic thing we've ever
seen.

3111
03:59:38,011 --> 03:59:47,967
SAM: Yes. And in the corner, half-frozen Geppetto
is saying, "Yes, yes, yes!" The coals and the fire

3112
03:59:47,967 --> 03:59:55,266
flare with a burst of fire that fills the room
with light for a second. The Beast drops to one

3113
03:59:55,266 --> 04:00:04,890
knee, startled and stunned. He says, "No, no! Yes,
yes!" He goes in for another kiss. He looks

3114
04:00:04,890 --> 04:00:12,337
panicky. His skin is growing paler. His shoulders
are slumping. He's growing weaker as he kisses

3115
04:00:12,337 --> 04:00:21,661
you, and weaker. Finally he collapses on the
ground. The troll, confused, turns and goes to eat

3116
04:00:21,661 --> 04:00:29,583
some chocolate. Whatever magic was controlling
him, the spell has been broken. The Pied Piper is

3117
04:00:29,583 --> 04:00:38,882
looking around like, oh shit! Please don't hurt
me! I'm really weak! The Beast is writhing in pain

3118
04:00:38,882 --> 04:00:41,497
on the floor. He's alive, but in bad shape.

3119
04:00:41,497 --> 04:00:43,688
AMY: Is he still a beast, or is he human?

3120
04:00:43,688 --> 04:00:48,793
SAM: He's still a beast, but he's curled up in a
fetal position.

3121
04:00:48,793 --> 04:00:55,998
AMY: No one ever wants to have sex with me! I ruin
everything!

3122
04:00:55,998 --> 04:01:01,530
STEFANIE: I'm going to go up to her and say, Hey!
Remember how previously you only wanted tiny men?

3123
04:01:01,530 --> 04:01:06,623
I feel like you've made a character development!

3124
04:01:06,623 --> 04:01:08,063
YURI: This is an arc for you!

3125
04:01:08,063 --> 04:01:11,788
H MICHAEL: I'm 6'6", but I'm into fucking you!

3126
04:01:11,788 --> 04:01:18,755
SAM: From the entrance of the room, a woman
appears, a beautiful woman in a dress. Also

3127
04:01:18,755 --> 04:01:28,859
holding two swords, because that's all I have. She
says, "Well, you did it. You found true love.

3128
04:01:28,859 --> 04:01:38,407
"Another successful cruise." It is Beauty, all
smiles, totally normal. As she talks, Beast

3129
04:01:38,407 --> 04:01:47,038
springs back to life and dusts himself off. Sorry,
knocks you over. He shakes your hand, Queen, and

3130
04:01:47,038 --> 04:01:53,677
says, "I had a feeling. I knew it would be you! I
always have a feeling, don't I, Beast? I mean,

3131
04:01:53,677 --> 04:02:02,098
"Beauty? You should be proud! Excited! Enjoy this
moment, and the many more ahead of you! For if one

3132
04:02:02,098 --> 04:02:08,079
"thing cannot be killed, it is the immense and
unrelenting force of the heart. Romance makes us

3133
04:02:08,079 --> 04:02:15,650
"do crazy things, like sabotaging your own cruise
line, but it also makes us sane! Remember this

3134
04:02:15,650 --> 04:02:24,863
"day, whenever your queenly heart grows lonely. Or
whenever your brain makes you doubt your worth. Or

3135
04:02:24,863 --> 04:02:32,585
"when the hat on your head feels too heavy to lift.
Or when you stop believing in fairy tales. Or when

3136
04:02:32,585 --> 04:02:37,800
"you feel that life simply isn't right. Sorry, you
both."

3137
04:02:37,800 --> 04:02:39,798
MOLLY: I'm going to try to forget this day.

3138
04:02:39,798 --> 04:02:47,911
SAM: "Remember that in the end, no matter what we
do, true love always prevails." This is where I

3139
04:02:47,911 --> 04:02:54,262
ran out of time to write it, so everyone stands
back up. It was all a dream! I don't know, that's

3140
04:02:54,262 --> 04:02:55,792
the end.

3141
04:02:55,792 --> 04:03:01,559
YURI: Scarecrow, how much for the hat?

3142
04:03:01,559 --> 04:03:12,344
H MICHAEL: My skater-themed scarecrow hat? I'll
fresh-up swap you for whatever you got.

3143
04:03:12,344 --> 04:03:16,145
YURI: Fair enough. I will do anything for that
hat.

3144
04:03:16,145 --> 04:03:20,394
H MICHAEL: I can't believe I did all this fighting
and didn't even get fingered! I just got chest

3145
04:03:20,394 --> 04:03:22,527
cavity.

3146
04:03:22,527 --> 04:03:24,156
YURI: I will finger you for that hat.

3147
04:03:24,156 --> 04:03:25,812
H MICHAEL: Done! Hot deal.

3148
04:03:25,812 --> 04:03:27,604
NOELLE: Use your Mage Hand.

3149
04:03:27,604 --> 04:03:29,578
YURI: I will use my Mage Hand.

3150
04:03:29,578 --> 04:03:31,166
STEFANIE: The bonus episode.

3151
04:03:31,166 --> 04:03:36,058
H MICHAEL: Can I do a dexterity roll to jack him
off?

3152
04:03:36,058 --> 04:03:39,002
SAM: Why not. Roll a d20.

3153
04:03:39,002 --> 04:03:42,007
H MICHAEL: Five. It takes forever.

3154
04:03:42,007 --> 04:03:43,619
SAM: It's dry.

3155
04:03:43,619 --> 04:03:46,595
H MICHAEL: You are bright red tomorrow.

3156
04:03:46,595 --> 04:03:48,950
AMY: It's nothing but straw.

3157
04:03:48,950 --> 04:03:54,503
STEFANIE: There has to be a subculture for that.

3158
04:03:54,503 --> 04:03:56,298
YURI: The Hatter's into that.

3159
04:03:56,298 --> 04:04:01,054
NOELLE: Straw dog! It's straw dog!

3160
04:04:01,054 --> 04:04:06,452
SAM: And on that note, we conclude our love story.
Thank you all for playing. Thank you for giving

3161
04:04:06,452 --> 04:04:15,018
yourself to the romance. Tell me this, do you
think Peter and Wendy are going to get back

3162
04:04:15,018 --> 04:04:16,596
together?

3163
04:04:16,596 --> 04:04:22,711
NOELLE: I'm over here trying to act up how wounded
I am, in hopes that she'll come over and use her

3164
04:04:22,711 --> 04:04:24,431
healing touch on me.

3165
04:04:24,431 --> 04:04:31,979
MOLLY: Yeah, I think I fucking fall for it and I
go and cradle your head. I'm like, you idiot. You

3166
04:04:31,979 --> 04:04:34,975
fucking idiot. And I heal you.

3167
04:04:34,975 --> 04:04:36,688
SAM: The Scarecrow and the Hatter end up
together?

3168
04:04:36,688 --> 04:04:40,320
MOLLY: And I'm like, can we please get out of this
horrible place?

3169
04:04:40,320 --> 04:04:45,587
H MICHAEL: I've got to say, as somebody who's been
in relationships that are a vicious cycle, these

3170
04:04:45,587 --> 04:04:48,520
two should <i>not</i>. This is broken.

3171
04:04:48,520 --> 04:04:52,414
NOELLE: I think that it's true love! I do believe
in love, I do!

3172
04:04:52,414 --> 04:04:55,697
AMY: I will be rooting for you two!

3173
04:04:55,697 --> 04:05:00,702
NOELLE: You deserve love, you beautiful girl!

3174
04:05:00,702 --> 04:05:06,882
AMY: Well, thank you so much for saying that! Is
Beauty and the Beast, are they still a thing?

3175
04:05:06,882 --> 04:05:13,710
SAM: For the next 55 minutes, he loves her. I'm
sorry, Beauty and the Beast? Yeah, they're still

3176
04:05:13,710 --> 04:05:15,092
together. They're married.

3177
04:05:15,092 --> 04:05:18,738
STEFANIE: I feel like there's ploy for polyamory
right there.

3178
04:05:18,738 --> 04:05:19,867
SAM: Sure.

3179
04:05:19,867 --> 04:05:21,847
NOELLE: You could join a threesome with Beauty and
Beast.

3180
04:05:21,847 --> 04:05:33,876
AMY: I was only looking for a king, but if I got a
second queen? I'm in. It's Beauty and the Beast

3181
04:05:33,876 --> 04:05:36,086
and the Me.

3182
04:05:36,086 --> 04:05:42,977
SAM: I like that story. All right, well, thank you
guys for coming tonight and playing this very

3183
04:05:42,977 --> 04:05:48,061
weird game. Thank you all for watching. Thanks to
our sponsors, whoever it was. Star Wars

3184
04:05:48,061 --> 04:05:59,616
Battlefield. Mine. Battlefront. Battlefront II.
Buy it with your money. What?

3185
04:05:59,616 --> 04:06:03,042
H MICHAEL: I just drank so much apple juice. How
am I getting home?

3186
04:06:03,042 --> 04:06:19,865
SAM: That's it. Go love each other and go jack off
a straw guy tonight, everybody. Good night. Muah.

3187
04:06:19,865 --> 04:06:21,423
Bye bye.

3188
04:06:21,423 --> 04:12:37,721
