1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,026
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:07,802
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording,

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:11,294
because my camera light's not on, but
nevertheless, welcome. (laughs)

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:12,942
TRAVIS: We're totally recording.

5
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:17,821
MATT: I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys,
welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,205
joining us later this evening, but before we get
to that we have announcements to go over real

7
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:26,903
fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is
sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group

8
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,331
called Quidd! If you want to talk about that
first?

9
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:35,708
SAM: Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our
sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:48,552
your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's
bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the

11
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:54,544
company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so
little-known fact about me, I have access to the

12
00:00:54,544 --> 00:01:01,293
BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and
sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel

13
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:07,209
transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I
would do a dramatic reading of it for you right

14
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,144
now.

15
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:09,811
LIAM: Here we go.

16
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:16,193
SAM: News from the front! This is Nigel J.
Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23,

17
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:20,859
1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM
Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight

18
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:26,238
against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it
Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers,

19
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:31,526
cards and Funko figures on your telephone device.
Our lads on the frontlines are already using it!

20
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:34,825
We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the
Royal Navy.

21
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:41,440
Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on
the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,651
helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin.

23
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:49,909
But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have
discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank

24
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,933
commander Ivan Bashenko.

25
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:57,511
With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world.
Morale better now with thousands of stickers to

26
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:03,340
collect that can be used like emojis in messages
to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with

27
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,206
these cute stickers!

28
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:10,867
Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We
spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an

29
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,619
American Doughboy.

30
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:21,692
I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to
collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty,

31
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:30,664
Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star
Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take

32
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,139
that, Emperor Hirohito!

33
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:39,648
Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your
British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat

34
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:46,185
the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go
to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night,

35
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,829
good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip!

36
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:52,143
(cheering)

37
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,382
TRAVIS: I'm so glad that's available on the BBC.

38
00:02:54,382 --> 00:03:00,373
SAM: Yeah, it was a weird transcript. I would have
shown the newsreel, but it was just a transcript.

39
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:05,519
MATT: Fair enough. Well, thank you for the update
on that, and thank you, Quidd for sponsoring

40
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,384
tonight's episode. Really appreciate it.

41
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,204
LIAM: Did they win the war?

42
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,647
SAM: Find out next time!

43
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:13,119
(laughter)

44
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:16,680
MATT: All righty, let's see. Do you have any merch
updates at all, Laura?

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,104
LAURA: There's stuff in the store!

46
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:23,850
MATT: There you go. Perfect. Good, I like it,
thank you. The Green Ronin Campaign Guide.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,795
Pre-orders go up on Monday, guys!

48
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:29,080
ALL: What!

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,264
LAURA: Oh my god.

50
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:38,673
MATT: Yes, and if you get the book and the pdf, I
think the pdf is available immediately, so some of

51
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:41,915
you will have access to actually read the book on
Monday.

52
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,981
LAURA: Are you so nervous, Matt?

53
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,220
MATT: I'm so nervous. (laughs nervously)

54
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,193
TALIESIN: People can actually, in real time, call
us when we're wrong on our own stuff.

55
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:53,509
TRAVIS: What do you mean, finally? They do that
every week.

56
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,576
MARISHA: Finally? Although you are Taliesin
Jaffe.

57
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:59,794
TALIESIN: This is a level of pain I've only
dreamed of; I'm very excited.

58
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:03,411
LIAM: Hey. We're so proud of you.

59
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,920
TRAVIS: Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,389
SAM: Hold on though, we haven't read it yet. What
if it's terribly written, by a child?

61
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,316
LAURA: We'll find out he used crayon. It's all
written in marker.

62
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:17,680
MATT: Probably. Do you know how hard it is to get
crayon printed these days?

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,847
MARISHA: Only if the writers' room dropped the
ball.

64
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:28,028
MATT: Well, I hope you guys enjoy it, so look
forward to that. The podcast is now episodes 11

65
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:32,909
through 20, right? Up on the Apple Store. So you
can go ahead and download those, which are

66
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,793
awesome.

67
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,695
MARISHA: Yep, Apple and Google Play.

68
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:42,577
MATT: Yes. And those are the ones. Of course we'll
have Talks Machina next Tuesday at 7:00pm about

69
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:46,646
this episode tonight, here on Twitch and Alpha,
7:00pm Pacific, with our fantastic host Brian

70
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:50,029
Foster, so you can check that out. Wednesday Club
next week for you?

71
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,875
TALIESIN: Wednesday Club, we're talking about
Comic Con, because Comic Con is coming up, and

72
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,685
we're going to try and give you a first-timer's
guide to Comic Con: If you've never been to one,

73
00:04:56,685 --> 00:05:02,213
what to expect, what to do for fun, and all sorts
of things that you could see or do in San Diego.

74
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:06,184
Other than us. Thank you, I was very proud of last
night.

75
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:10,656
MATT: We're not having a show next week, we're
going to be at Comic Con. Yeah, we have a week

76
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:15,220
off. So we'll miss you guys next week, but we do
have our Critical Role panel on Saturday at Comic

77
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,496
Con, it's at 10:30am in Room 6...

78
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,665
TRAVIS: BC... E.

79
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:27,094
MATT: It's a nice big room. You guys should come,
we're going to have silly questions, Q and A,

80
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:30,428
conversations, stories and a lot of funness and
some cool surprises!

81
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,736
SAM and TALIESIN: Prizes?

82
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,021
MATT: Surprises!

83
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:38,199
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we have some announcements.

84
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,465
MATT: So hopefully you guys can make it at San
Diego Comic Con. If you're going to be there we'd

85
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:49,196
love to see you. And last but not least, Sagas of
Sundry: Dread. The third episode went up today.

86
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:53,337
MATT and MARISHA: (perfect unison) Shit's getting
real.

87
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:55,743
MATT: I'm going to marry you.

88
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:59,065
(laughter)

89
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:04,367
MATT: What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon
next month we have our live show, we mentioned it

90
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:09,609
last week. Tickets are still on sale for the
general admission. We're looking forward to having

91
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:11,489
you guys there, it's Friday evening.

92
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,524
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7:30. In fact,
we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last

93
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:19,193
theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll
never get that many people, and it went (explosion

94
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:24,445
sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat
theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you

95
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:31,162
didn't join us last year, you want to come to this
mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to

96
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:35,304
GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge
or anything for that, it's a standalone thing.

97
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:39,105
There are definitely tickets still available, it's
going to be super fun.

98
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:43,749
SAM: I feel like with that many people we should
have beach balls in the audience, and they can do

99
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,121
the wave.

100
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:47,169
MATT: Inflatable d20s to throw out there...

101
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,393
MARISHA: (gasps) You can get them. They're on
ThinkGeek I think.

102
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:54,477
MATT: This is a terrible idea.

103
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:56,358
TRAVIS: It's a great idea!

104
00:06:56,358 --> 00:07:03,487
MATT: Anyway, without further ado, I think that
concludes our announcements, and as such, let us

105
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:06,665
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

106
00:07:06,665 --> 00:08:37,745
[dramatic music]

107
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:45,135
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where
we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally

108
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:58,412
encountered the Undying King, returned in physical
form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite

109
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:03,113
unprepared for that venture, and gathered some
tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans

110
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:10,642
may be. Upon returning and discovering that your
disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal

111
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:17,781
he made with his patron the Raven Queen after
disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try

112
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:23,770
and gather more information about this and beseech
some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike

113
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:31,425
talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to
come visit her in Elysium on the Island of

114
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:38,217
Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and
causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and

115
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:45,724
went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her
island, you spoke with her. She gathered some

116
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:50,044
information from you, as Vecna seemed to be
blocking at least the influence and vision from a

117
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:56,259
lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing
unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the

118
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:02,517
other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of
Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather.

119
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:10,244
You then walked through the orchards that led to
the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke

120
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:15,862
with some of the guardians there, and were led
into the center of the citadel, where you met, in

121
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:24,003
the central throne room under the Zenith Tower,
Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you

122
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:32,010
spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain
gods in the battles to come, and were given a

123
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:39,026
challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You
accepted the challenge and racing to the top of

124
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:44,093
the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be
extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you

125
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:51,054
threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party
speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such

126
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:55,375
an important member of not just your team, but
your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued

127
00:10:55,375 --> 00:11:04,966
with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After
which, we left off as you exited the front of the

128
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:09,495
Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central
glade that marks the center of the

129
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:16,786
seemingly endless orchards that surround this
region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to

130
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:17,843
do?

131
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,669
TRAVIS: Eat all of the fruit.

132
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:20,924
LAURA: No.

133
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:24,798
TRAVIS: It was really good. It was just fruit, by
the way. Like I said.

134
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:28,848
SAM: We're still in heaven right now?

135
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,753
LAURA: We're still in Elysium.

136
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,872
TALIESIN: It's not quite heaven.

137
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:42,389
TRAVIS: Are there any other gods here that we
should curry favor with? For? Of?

138
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,776
LAURA: Are there any more gods here? Not that we
know of.

139
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,207
SAM: We forgot to ask.

140
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,776
TRAVIS: Did we?

141
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,107
LAURA: Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here.

142
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:57,723
MATT: You're looking at the series of the Sun Tree
cousins, one of which you've met, scattered

143
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:00,367
amongst this glade surrounding the central
citadel.

144
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:02,210
MARISHA: What a douche.

145
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,137
SAM: No other people? Guards? Nothing.

146
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:12,598
MATT: You have the guards behind you, the large
planetar and deva entities that stand there,

147
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:17,002
armored in their golden plate, after ushering you
out, are standing guard.

148
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,054
LAURA: Maybe we can ask them.

149
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,722
SAM: Sure. I'll go up to one and say, hello there,
big fellow.

150
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:29,977
MATT: Standing a full ten feet taller than you,
practically, the wings slightly bent, the large

151
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:34,598
planar entity kneels down. "Hello."

152
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:43,894
SAM: Hello. Vacation Scanlan here. Couple
questions. By the way, was he one of the ones who

153
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,762
fought in there?

154
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:48,124
MATT: Make a perception check.

155
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:52,290
SAM: Oh. Do they all look alike? 17 plus one.

156
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,800
MATT: Hard to tell. You didn't pay a lot of
attention.

157
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:06,163
SAM: Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions.
A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door

158
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:07,975
to another plane?

159
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:11,843
MATT: "I imagine the same way you came in."

160
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:21,982
SAM: A god brought us here. All right, cool.
Number two: Are there any other like your

161
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:27,946
Dawnfather around here? Any other gods in the
area?

162
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:34,823
MATT: "Across Elysium, there are two deities that
call it home: the Dawnfather and the Everlight."

163
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:42,436
SAM: So we covered our bases. Out of curiosity:
What are you called?

164
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:49,754
MATT: He looks very closely, and you get sense
that part of its nature is scanning through you;

165
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:56,127
it's getting a sense and a read of you as an
individual, and it says, "No one you need to worry

166
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:01,888
"about." Stands up and then takes two steps back
(heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight

167
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,496
ahead.

168
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,913
MARISHA: Scanlan, you should remember that line,
that's a good one.

169
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:14,772
SAM: Yeah. I already forgot it. I'm too
intimidated. Was it no one or something? I don't

170
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,043
know. Well, good speaking to you.

171
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:21,122
MATT: Still looks out. Doesn't respond.

172
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:26,764
SAM: Well, how do we get out of here? Can she take
us home?

173
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:27,932
MARISHA: Yeah.

174
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,641
LIAM: She does on the daily.

175
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:36,450
SAM: I know, but I don't know. They talked about
some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and

176
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,113
the bad gods in.

177
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:44,636
MATT: To remind you of what happened last time.
There was talking about possibly... or at least

178
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:49,860
there was the Trammel, the Prime Trammels that
were used previously to seal the Chained Oblivion,

179
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:58,714
Tharizdun, and that the orchestrator, the designer
of those was Ioun, the Knowing Goddess. Ioun,

180
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:05,880
however, has sealed herself away, being a wounded
god, long recovering, and the only information

181
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:14,048
that Pelor has of where she hid herself, the key,
essentially, is not an object but a person. You're

182
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:24,681
seeking an individual, of which you were given a
solar light map of a single small home in a forest

183
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:29,126
ravine not far from a place that you've noticed
was near the Pools of Wittebak, which is in the

184
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,956
Cliffkeep Mountains.

185
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:34,281
SAM: Yeah, but there was also a mention of some
Divine Gate that keeps people from--

186
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:39,563
MATT: Well, the Divine Gate is a known existing
entity. It's essentially a large gate that

187
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,001
prevents the gods from returning to the Prime
Material Plane.

188
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:46,766
LIAM: It's like a metaphysical screen door that
keeps flies out.

189
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:49,055
LAURA: So the gods can't get in and out.

190
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,373
SAM: Sure, sure.

191
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:57,311
MARISHA: Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now
have to get--

192
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:02,692
LAURA: We have to get near the the Cliffkeep
Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we

193
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,016
need to go.

194
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:10,635
MARISHA: And the Cliffkeep is not too far from
Whitestone?

195
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:15,937
MATT: Cliffkeep Mountains go across a lot of the
northern side of Tal'Dorei, from what you're

196
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:25,828
familiar with. Like, we're talking Kraghammer to
Gatshadow to the Jorenn Village. There's a lot of

197
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:30,875
things. It's like a big horizontal mountain range
that caps the top part of the continent.

198
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,899
MARISHA: Do I recognize the city that I can get us
to that's close?

199
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,768
MATT: Fort Daxio or Kraghammer.

200
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:41,524
SAM: Haven't been to Kraghammer for a while,
although Daxio might be worth a check.

201
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,368
TALIESIN: What's closest to the pools?

202
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:51,065
MATT: Probably Terrah or the Pools of Wittebak.
Those are the two that are closest.

203
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:52,360
LAURA: What is Terrah?

204
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,664
MARISHA: My home.

205
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,379
MATT: Terrah's not your home.

206
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,824
MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth
Ashari.

207
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,492
SAM: My other home, summer home.

208
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,496
MATT: The home away from home.

209
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:14,607
LIAM: Can you also remind me where my Vecdar made
me feel Vecna-- where on the Prime Material

210
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,860
Plane?

211
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,120
MATT: Yes. Oh, where?

212
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,018
LIAM: Yeah, we talked about it, but I can't
remember.

213
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:30,084
MATT: You did, yes. It seemed to be hundreds of
miles northwest of Vasselheim. You didn't sense

214
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:34,381
any movement, but you knew the general direction
and distance.

215
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,715
LIAM: And that was yesterday.

216
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,039
MATT: Correct.

217
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,755
LAURA: Teacher?

218
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,097
MATT: Yes, Laura?

219
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:48,142
LAURA: I was excited the last game and somehow
have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper.

220
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,478
LIAM: Oh, she doesn't get to have it now. That's
how that works.

221
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:53,549
LAURA: I don't know how it happened! It's not with
my stuffs.

222
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,290
MATT: That's okay, I remember what it does, and if
you decide to use it--

223
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,488
LAURA: You'll tell me? Okay.

224
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,614
MATT: I won't tell you. You tell me you want to
use it.

225
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:07,663
LAURA: Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and
it's not here.

226
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:10,987
TALIESIN: It's weird how he's so nice and yet it
still feels like you are in so much trouble.

227
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:14,362
LAURA: I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys.

228
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:16,809
LIAM: He's calm, but indifferent. Like the
Dawnfather.

229
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:23,987
MATT: All right, so what would you like to do?

230
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,103
TRAVIS: Yeah, what would we like to do?

231
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:30,047
MARISHA: Should we go to Terrah? Check in with
them, I guess, while we're there?

232
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,630
TALIESIN: Seems prudent.

233
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,366
MARISHA: And talk to Pa'tice.

234
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,694
TRAVIS: Yeah.

235
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:38,138
MARISHA: All right. We ready to go?

236
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:43,108
TALIESIN: I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and
everything, but I've had my fill.

237
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:48,122
MARISHA: I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to
Plane Shift us to Terrah.

238
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,020
MATT: To Terrah, all righty.

239
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,634
MARISHA: Mind the gap.

240
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,840
TALIESIN: What gap?

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,520
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

242
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,076
TRAVIS: No effects from eating that fruit, right?

243
00:18:57,076 --> 00:19:01,718
MATT: No, you didn't sense any effects from that
fruit, at the moment.

244
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,804
TRAVIS: Didn't remove a curse or anything?

245
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:07,290
MATT: No, you didn't. Nothing really caught you up
to speed, in that.

246
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,300
LAURA: Are we by those fruit trees again?

247
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,392
MATT: There are no fruit-bearing trees directly
near you. The Sun Trees are around you. Further in

248
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:23,609
they do, yes. All righty. Bringing up my notes on
Terrah, since that's where you're going.

249
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:27,671
MARISHA: Yeah, I should probably--

250
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:37,313
LAURA: I'm so confused about the order of things.
If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we

251
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:46,153
need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know
we need godly power in order to imbue them, right?

252
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,592
Or something?

253
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:52,231
LIAM: Either here or soon we need to sit and work
this out.

254
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,021
SAM: What do we need to bring into the trammel?

255
00:19:56,021 --> 00:20:04,767
LAURA: Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap,
zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be

256
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,935
strong enough to--

257
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,283
LIAM: Power the trammel?

258
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:09,614
LAURA: Part of it? Not all of it.

259
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:15,118
MARISHA: We need to collect more, though, right? We
have to get like eight or something.

260
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,760
SAM: Wait, it said that?

261
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,497
MATT: You weren't given any indication as to how
many you needed.

262
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:22,319
LAURA: But it did seem like this is not enough.

263
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,482
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight
centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry.

264
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:32,846
TRAVIS: I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of
power.

265
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:40,238
MATT: All right, so as you complete your spell,
Keyleth, you step through the base of the nearest

266
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,976
tree, possibly the same one you spoke with earlier
if you want to be a dick about it.

267
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:53,709
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole.
That sounds worse for us. But fuck it.

268
00:20:53,709 --> 00:21:02,201
MATT: All right, you aggressively stampede through
the center of this one tree and emerge on the

269
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:12,177
other side from one of the surrounding trees on
the Terrah village. There are a number of these

270
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:20,474
pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees
that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy

271
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:25,370
tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in
this area, that have made a lot of the land unable

272
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,140
to support large forms of plant life, or at least the
trees that used to exist here. So you step out and

273
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,545
emerge from the exterior of the village as it
domes down into this small crater that you recall

274
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:42,338
seeing before, where most of the village inhabits the
central portion, and the village is there before

275
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:43,357
you.

276
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,678
MARISHA: What were the shard things called again?

277
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,332
MATT: The shard things?

278
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,585
MARISHA: The things we need to collect?

279
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:58,377
MATT: There wasn't really a name for them more
than they're small pieces of essence of the

280
00:21:58,377 --> 00:21:59,688
deity.

281
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:02,590
MARISHA: So we need pieces of god.

282
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,925
LIAM: Does the little seed of light given to my
sister look anything like the little seed that

283
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:14,715
Scanlan and Vax saw from riding the shadow
creature in the sky?

284
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:21,393
MATT: No. In a sense that it's a small source
of power of some kind, but what you saw there was

285
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:25,875
maybe about that large on the platform. What she
has is bead size.

286
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:37,011
LAURA: Is it this size? Or this size?

287
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:42,446
MATT: Comparable to each. So you stand outside of
Terrah. What are you doing?

288
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,201
SAM: What time of day is it? How tired are we?

289
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:56,990
MATT: Based on when you left, it would still be
probably-- well, you were over in Vasselheim, which

290
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:04,186
means it's getting dark, actually. I'd say with
the way the sun has passed through the sky now,

291
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:08,926
you've just gotten past dusk. There's still
light in the sky, but it's going from oranges to

292
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:15,813
purples to dark blues on the horizon, and you can
see hints of firelight, torchlight and candlelight

293
00:23:15,813 --> 00:23:18,546
from within the actual city below.

294
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:22,870
SAM: Well, what are we going to need on this trip?
Maybe we should get whatever supplies we need. Is

295
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,145
it far? Are we going to become gas?

296
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:28,143
TRAVIS: Are we going underground?

297
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:29,826
MARISHA: Oh, to Terrah?

298
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:35,378
SAM: No, we'e in Terrah. But the next day, we're
going to the--

299
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:37,050
TALIESIN: To the pools.

300
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:43,679
MARISHA: Do we want to stay the night here, then? I
can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp

301
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,837
here.

302
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:49,381
LAURA: Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in
the same place?

303
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,418
LIAM: I can sense him?

304
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:56,139
MATT: You can sense him. He is, from your current
location, thousands of miles from you.

305
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,293
LAURA: Oh, hard to tell, then?

306
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:04,090
LIAM: He's still really shitty, though.

307
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,281
MATT: Yeah, very heavy west-northwest direction
from you, currently.

308
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:15,826
SAM: Well, sleep? Do we need to get any intel on
where these pools are? Do we need anything?

309
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:19,532
LAURA: We should maybe talk to the people of
Terrah? It's not that late.

310
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:25,322
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room
for us.

311
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:28,772
TRAVIS: Are you the leader of all the people?

312
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:32,249
MARISHA: I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the
Voice of the Tempest.

313
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:36,092
TRAVIS: Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to
fucking brag.

314
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:41,187
MARISHA: No, there's four of us, and I'm
one of the four.

315
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:43,204
SAM: Do you know the one who lives here?

316
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:44,248
MARISHA: I do.

317
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,598
SAM: Then let's go see him or her. Or they.

318
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:51,285
MARISHA: No, we can just go, like I was saying
five minutes ago. Let's just go.

319
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:58,848
MATT: All right. So as you walk down into the
village, a number of the guardians step out

320
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:04,019
quickly, seeing an approaching party, however,
recognizing Keyleth and her station immediately,

321
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,059
turn into an escort that leads you to the center
portion of the village.

322
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,657
MARISHA: I request Pa'tice.

323
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:14,810
MATT: Quickly enough, they go and retrieve
Pa'tice. You see the elderly form of the leader

324
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:23,636
you've met before step out, the graying hair, the
weathered dark skin tones, the long greens and

325
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:29,800
brown leathers that drape off, showing hints of
the knees and lower feet, the large walking staff

326
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,107
that he carries at his side as he approaches and
the headdress that seems to be a combination of

327
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:45,115
thick twines and shale shards that have been woven
in, steps forward. "Keyleth. An unexpected visit,

328
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:46,563
"most definitely."

329
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:47,856
MARISHA: Kaitiaki.

330
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:48,973
MATT: "Kaitiaki."

331
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:54,800
MARISHA: Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late
intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane

332
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,302
of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're
fighting a god right now, well, more of like a

333
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:07,263
demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm
probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any

334
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:09,468
food? Let's talk over dinner.

335
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:13,333
MATT: "We have food, yes. You are guests of
Terrah. Please, we will provide whatever you

336
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:19,493
"require. Come, provide them a meal!" And he puts
his hand out and they run off quickly.

337
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:23,802
TALIESIN: I like that people just feed us. We show up,
and there's food.

338
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:25,960
SAM: You've been used to that your whole life.

339
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,511
TALIESIN: Not at home.

340
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:30,640
SAM: I have to sing for dinner. You just say--

341
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,934
TALIESIN: Have you ever tried not singing for
dinner?

342
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,295
SAM: Maybe I'll get more food.

343
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,937
TALIESIN: You might!

344
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:45,813
LIAM: You did have one year-ish where you were on
the skids. You did your Prince and the Pauper bit

345
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,264
for a little bit.

346
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:52,450
TALIESIN: It's a big vague, but yes. I was on a
boat for quite a while.

347
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,455
TRAVIS: Oh my god, can we eat food?

348
00:26:55,455 --> 00:27:00,225
(laughter)

349
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:05,882
MATT: And quick as that, you guys make your way
down. It's a modest meal, but it's a meal

350
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:12,986
nonetheless. Mostly hunted creatures of the local
mountainside, some dried beets and root.

351
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,186
MARISHA: We always try to source locally.

352
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,020
TALIESIN: Charmingly provincial.

353
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,587
MATT: (laughs)

354
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:22,428
LAURA: Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people
know that the world is in danger.

355
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:28,319
MARISHA: So the world's in danger, as she said--

356
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,942
SAM: The waiter is like, what?

357
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:36,925
LIAM: Runs out the door.

358
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:40,041
MARISHA: Aw shit! I just induced panic.

359
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:48,793
MATT: Pa'tice, who's sat down with you, says
quickly, "We have been made aware via the other

360
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:55,489
"Ashari that there is some danger possibly coming.
We are awaiting word of what to do other than keep

361
00:27:55,489 --> 00:28:01,378
"ourselves in a defensive position. We have to
guard the rift, of course. But should there be a

362
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:11,202
"call to action, we'll do what we can. I'm
unfamiliar with this Vecna, but whatever you plan,

363
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:12,921
"please be careful."

364
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:22,564
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think
I would want you all to be relief for the

365
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:28,866
surrounding area and surrounding villages if
anything disastrous were to happen. I know you

366
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:33,306
have to guard the rift and that is insanely
important and especially right now with someone

367
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:40,122
like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But
if anything were to happen, I don't know if you

368
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:44,760
could house extra people during a disaster.

369
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:55,223
MATT: "We are quite good at assembling makeshift
and temporary lodging. The rock is our friend, if

370
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:56,249
"you will."

371
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,294
MARISHA: Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would
need.

372
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:00,324
MATT: "Of course, of course! Not a worry."

373
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:07,025
MARISHA: Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim,
close to Pyrah.

374
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:11,049
MATT: "Have you asked Pyrah for aid, as well?"

375
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,311
MARISHA: They've also been put on alert, but we
have not personally been there yet since this has

376
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:16,317
happened.

377
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:22,464
MATT: "Well. Good. They're closer. But we're happy
to help if we can."

378
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:24,672
MARISHA: Yeah. Thank you.

379
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:29,432
LAURA: Things are happening very quickly. We just
happened here first.

380
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:33,298
MATT: "We're happy to help. Where are you off
to?"

381
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:36,626
SAM: The Pools of Wittebak.

382
00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:39,860
MATT: "What brings you towards the Pools of
Wittebak?"

383
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,350
SAM: You know this place?

384
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,194
MATT: "It is a series of poisoned wells and
hulking, stupid giants."

385
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:49,035
SAM: Hulking, stupid giants?

386
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,767
LAURA: Giants? At the pools?

387
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,230
MATT: "Yes."

388
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,283
LAURA: I thought it was something about gnomes
there.

389
00:29:55,283 --> 00:29:56,700
MATT: "It was once."

390
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,978
SAM: They grew.

391
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:00,975
(laughter)

392
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:03,135
LAURA: Is that something you can do, Scanlan?

393
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,048
SAM: I don't know. (laughs)

394
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:15,377
MATT: "They're geothermic large puddles across the
mountainside. Various minerals being lifted up

395
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:21,141
"from the deep waters beneath the mountain. Heated,
bubbling, boiling, steaming. But the giants moved

396
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:29,829
"in hundreds of years ago, stomped around, and
ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish

397
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:34,365
"city of Wittebak with fumes and poison. Killed
most of them, and the rest fled to Kraghammer."

398
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,970
LIAM: Do you all ever broach the area or do you
just stay clear of it?

399
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,407
MATT: "Best to avoid, we have our own business to
deal with. And it's 100 miles from here. It's not

400
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,850
"much of an issue."

401
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,785
TALIESIN: And the pools are naturally poisonous?

402
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:51,225
MATT: "Well, some are toxic, some are not, but
since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the

403
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:55,454
"natural formations, some of them have grown toxic
or acidic, yes."

404
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,376
MARISHA: Do you know if people still try to live
there? We're looking for someone.

405
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:02,912
MATT: "If they are, they're foolish."

406
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,362
MARISHA: Okay.

407
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,425
TALIESIN: That's our kind of people.

408
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:08,639
LAURA: Maybe the person we're looking for is a
giant.

409
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:09,838
MARISHA: Maybe.

410
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:15,948
SAM: Do you know what type of giant? We've seen a
few types of giants. Do you know their make and

411
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:16,997
model?

412
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:21,724
MATT: "The dumbest. Hill giants."

413
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,005
LAURA: Hill giants.

414
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:24,178
TRAVIS: Yeah.

415
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:28,506
MATT: "Easy to outsmart, difficult to outrun.
They'll eat anything, even small little gnomes."

416
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:31,012
LAURA: Seems like they ate a lot of them.

417
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:32,777
SAM: (laughing) I guess so.

418
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:41,590
LAURA: Pasty, I have a question. Do you know
anything about Ioun?

419
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,159
MATT: "I know of the name."

420
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,859
LAURA: But not much.

421
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:50,480
MATT: "We're not the most devoted people."

422
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,544
LAURA: I know.

423
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:55,425
MARISHA: I saw that.

424
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,725
(laughter)

425
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:01,410
MATT: "I can't imagine I'd have any information
you wouldn't."

426
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,255
LAURA: Okay. Just checking.

427
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,862
MATT: "My apologies."

428
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:08,166
LAURA: This food is really good.

429
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,539
MATT: "Yes! Enjoy your meal!" And he gets up and
walks away.

430
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:15,439
TALIESIN: He was so officious.

431
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:20,526
LAURA: I thought we were walking into a fucking
lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we

432
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,356
were going to fight giants.

433
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,683
TRAVIS: This got so much better all of a sudden.

434
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:27,827
TALIESIN: If it were easy, it really wouldn't be
us, would it?

435
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:34,113
MARISHA: So the question is, is there actually
someone of some minor intelligence living there

436
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:39,528
that is this magical key, or did that person get
eaten by a giant?

437
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:47,696
TALIESIN: I cannot believe I'm about to say this.
I'm inclined to believe the god. They're in the

438
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:52,944
position where trying to trick us out of leaving
is not necessary. They could've just told us to

439
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:56,924
leave and be done with it. That information just
wouldn't suit them, I don't think.

440
00:32:56,924 --> 00:33:01,123
MARISHA: I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm
just wondering who the key is.

441
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:09,293
LAURA: It's possible the key is now inside of a
giant's stomach. In which case, it still would

442
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,956
be inside of someone. Just a different someone.

443
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,945
MARISHA: Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside.
Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation.

444
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:23,428
MATT: You do recall the map that was shown to you
by the Dawnfather Pelor. It was adjacent to the

445
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:28,907
pools, not actually in the Pools of Wittebak. It
was within a forest, and was a home.

446
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:36,372
LAURA: Oh! I remember it now! It was a home
inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's

447
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:44,020
it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a
home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my

448
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,486
map was.

449
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:50,370
MARISHA: Can we theoretically just mist over
everywhere?

450
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:56,274
LAURA: I mean and look out for a home in the
forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming

451
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:59,487
the home is going to be covered by treetop.

452
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:06,268
TRAVIS: We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm
just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of

453
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:12,960
traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward,
immediate gratification, fucking you know.

454
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,575
SAM: The Dawnfather said we must hurry or else the
world will end.

455
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:25,402
LAURA: It's very far. We could Misty Step to the
forest and then walk in the forest?

456
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:28,151
TRAVIS: Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm
a child?

457
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,492
LAURA: No reason, darling.

458
00:34:29,492 --> 00:34:31,698
TRAVIS: Okay. That would-- okay.

459
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:36,606
(laughter)

460
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:47,410
LIAM: Once this is all done, Grog, you and I will
go on a long trek together.

461
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,739
TRAVIS: Yeah? Yeah. I dig that.

462
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,766
LAURA: Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound
like you're being nice. I know you're being dark

463
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:57,241
and creepy right now.

464
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:02,817
TRAVIS: Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping
partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill.

465
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:05,778
LIAM: Can't predict this one.

466
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:08,494
TRAVIS: No marshmallows for this witch.

467
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:12,374
MARISHA: It is a little weird to be making
promises, though.

468
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:21,996
TALIESIN: Well, on that chipper little side note, I
think we should turn in for the evening.

469
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:25,444
SAM: Yes, do we have lodging?

470
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:31,323
MATT: Lodging is provided for you. They have a
number of various guest tents and small buildings

471
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:37,886
that provide you with space. Not the highest of
quality of places you've slept in, probably, and

472
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,719
if you wanted to provide your mansion instead,
you're welcome to, but ample food, quiet sleep.

473
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:51,738
It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find
yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and

474
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:55,651
having this being the first time many of you
have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is

475
00:35:55,731 --> 00:36:01,620
just a general low hum or vibration to the
ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's

476
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:09,922
probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this
slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low

477
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:15,405
rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems
to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you

478
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:22,038
were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not
off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it

479
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:27,251
actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all
come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and

480
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,070
are preparing for the next leg of your journey.
What do you wish to do?

481
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,392
TRAVIS: Could I attune, either before I go to
sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower

482
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,109
instead of the Bloodaxe?

483
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:40,047
MATT: You may. All right. Any other attunements,
anyone wishes to--

484
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,524
LIAM: I'll set the Deathwalker's Ward to acid.

485
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:44,290
MATT: All right, to acid. Boom.

486
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,914
LAURA: Before everyone else gets up, can I go find
where Vax is sleeping?

487
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:50,866
MATT: You may.

488
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:58,969
LAURA: This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock?
Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch?

489
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:06,511
MATT: They're lodging made from large pieces of
shale and rock, jammed into a somewhat triangular

490
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:10,374
pattern to form an earth yurt, if you will.

491
00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:14,727
LAURA: Oi. Vax. Are you naked?

492
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,313
LIAM: Yes.

493
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:20,550
LAURA: Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth,
sorry.

494
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:30,452
MARISHA: Keyleth opens the shamble door first with
a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm

495
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:32,012
not like that.

496
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:35,032
LAURA: You don't sleep naked?

497
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:38,011
MARISHA: I'm going to go get coffee.

498
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,322
LAURA: Okay.

499
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:43,759
MATT: (laughs) Keyleth darts off in the distance
and the two of you are left within the tent.

500
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:46,880
LAURA: Are you decent?

501
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,607
LIAM: Yes.

502
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:50,330
LAURA: I'm coming in.

503
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,230
LIAM: I'm still naked.

504
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:59,950
LAURA: Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I
turn my back to him.

505
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,324
LIAM: I start putting on the rest of my armor.

506
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,628
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

507
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:10,522
LAURA: Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going
to.

508
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:11,973
LIAM: Of course you can.

509
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:18,204
LAURA: I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever
try to take these back?

510
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:28,651
LIAM: Well, they're going to be yours, anyway.

511
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:33,928
LAURA: Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I
do things is that I take great joy in irritating

512
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:43,986
you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not
worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm

513
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:45,200
turning around.

514
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,750
LIAM: I am covered.

515
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:55,739
LAURA: Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm
and confident now. It's weird.

516
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,332
LIAM: I mean, I'm on bonus time.

517
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:02,814
LAURA: Is he still cold?

518
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:09,281
MATT: His skin is colder than a warm body, yes.

519
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:11,381
LIAM: But I'm not Bobby Drake, right?

520
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,665
LAURA: What's his heartbeat like?

521
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:17,796
MATT: (very slow heartbeat)

522
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:20,388
LAURA: (groans) Jeez!

523
00:39:20,388 --> 00:39:22,348
TALIESIN: Wow, way to hang onto that one, Matt.

524
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:26,325
LIAM: But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.

525
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,570
LAURA: Is there blood?

526
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:34,264
MATT: Yeah, he bleeds, and it's a pretty open
wound. You watch as the wound slowly seals itself

527
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:35,188
up.

528
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:37,250
LAURA: (gasping) No fucking way!

529
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,889
LIAM: Oh, I didn't know it did that.

530
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:43,589
(laughter)

531
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,240
LAURA: That's really cool.

532
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,029
LIAM: Thank you!

533
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:51,484
LAURA: Wow.

534
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:57,767
LIAM: I don't know, this is the dumbest
conversation. This is bonus time. I shouldn't be

535
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:10,049
here. It was the long sleep or come back and
help.

536
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:18,904
LAURA: So she gave you the option and then you
came back and now you're what? Super? Super

537
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:20,133
half-elf?

538
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:28,299
LIAM: Well, I'm just following through on a
promise made.

539
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:37,070
LAURA: And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're
gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him

540
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,413
and you're gone that second or is it like we kill
him and you're here for another week or until

541
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:44,739
the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here?

542
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,142
LIAM: There isn't really a handbook.

543
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:49,541
LAURA: She didn't tell you?

544
00:40:49,541 --> 00:41:09,521
LIAM: When Vecna is destroyed, she will call me
back to where I would be right now. I expect

545
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:17,581
everyone-- Keyleth and I have barely spoken-- I
expect everyone to be sad, but I wish you wouldn't

546
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:22,762
be so sad, not exorbitantly so, because I--

547
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:27,429
LAURA: Exorbitant? That's a good word.

548
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:42,132
LIAM: I read. Not as much as some, but I read.
This is the path that I have chosen for myself and

549
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:51,717
I did it based out of desperation, at first. But
everyone dies.

550
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,706
LAURA: I know.

551
00:41:53,706 --> 00:42:02,964
LIAM: And I think our group has become a little
spoiled. We're not your ordinary group of idiots. We

552
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:05,337
have blessings.

553
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:07,107
LAURA: We're blessed idiots.

554
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:15,356
LIAM: Blessed idiots, yes, and I know that we've
gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing

555
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:30,076
anyone, but your average farmer or seamstress
doesn't come back. And everybody dies, and all

556
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:36,229
that matters is what you do with what you have,
and I have done a lot, and I've taken great pride

557
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:49,542
watching all that you have done. And I have good
friends and I have fallen in love. More than most,

558
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,127
I've had.

559
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:57,536
LAURA: Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her
side?

560
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:06,738
LIAM: That I don't really know. I imagine she'll
keep me close.

561
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:13,676
LAURA: Do you like her now?

562
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,215
LIAM: Yes.

563
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:17,606
LAURA: That's good.

564
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:24,824
LIAM: She's necessary and she's of use, and I like
that.

565
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:36,197
LAURA: She brought you back to us for a while. I
like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking

566
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:46,454
boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's
fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go.

567
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:48,386
I'm glad you asked for them back.

568
00:43:48,386 --> 00:43:50,917
LIAM: I don't have a lot of time. They really are
my favorite thing.

569
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:51,872
LAURA: I know.

570
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:53,664
LIAM: Physical thing.

571
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:58,171
LAURA: Just make sure you write it down
somewhere that after you go back to the Raven

572
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:03,114
Queen that your sister is your favorite in the
universe.

573
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:08,420
LIAM: Dear, every stitch on my body is yours when
I am gone.

574
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:17,103
LAURA: I don't want every stitch. None of it's
worth you leaving.

575
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:25,240
LIAM: I slide my feet into the shoes and I wiggle my
toes around. Oh, I'm sorry. I also have a

576
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,748
confession to make.

577
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,061
LAURA: What?

578
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:34,507
LIAM: I don't exactly have your shoes anymore.

579
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:35,726
LAURA: What?!

580
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:38,528
LIAM: I think that I left them in the Feywild.

581
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:40,818
LAURA: The Feywild?

582
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:46,189
LIAM: Yeah, I think I dropped them into a bog. They
didn't fit me.

583
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:50,023
LAURA: You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have
just put them in the Bag of Holding?

584
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,688
LIAM: I'm still me.

585
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:57,185
LAURA: Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot.

586
00:44:57,185 --> 00:45:02,890
LIAM: You have very cute, small feet that fit in
the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet.

587
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,806
LAURA: That's great.

588
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:06,974
LIAM: There's probably shoes here.

589
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:14,820
LAURA: Probably. All right.

590
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,169
LIAM: I pull out her shoes and I put them down.

591
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:19,178
LAURA: Well, at least there's that!

592
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:23,937
MATT: Got your shoes back. Keyleth returns with
some coffee. The rest of you come to

593
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:28,718
consciousness, and the morning sun is now blaring
down over the Cliffkeep. It's a strangely clear

594
00:45:28,718 --> 00:45:35,919
sky for the north. While a lot of it is relatively
cold usually, you're used to seeing the snow-

595
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:40,548
capped mountaintops-- oh, you found it! There you
go.

596
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:42,252
TALIESIN: It was with you the whole time.

597
00:45:42,252 --> 00:45:44,302
LIAM: Must have been inside your shoes.

598
00:45:44,302 --> 00:45:48,738
LAURA: Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and
I didn't realize it!

599
00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:50,470
TRAVIS: Thank you, chat.

600
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,071
LAURA: Did they really know where I put it?

601
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:56,536
TRAVIS: Yeah, they know where your shit is.

602
00:45:56,536 --> 00:46:01,061
SAM: The chat knew where you put your stuff?

603
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:04,751
TRAVIS: "It's in the page in front of your blue
divider."

604
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,707
SAM: No way!

605
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:11,340
LAURA: Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys!

606
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,561
LIAM: How many fingers am I holding up?

607
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,996
MATT: So bringing it back in, guys.

608
00:46:16,996 --> 00:46:18,450
SAM: Yes, we have a guest.

609
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,462
MATT: Yes. At some point. So what do you guys want
to do?

610
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:24,816
SAM: Set off! For the Pools of Hatabah!

611
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:28,333
(laughter)

612
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,097
TALIESIN: For the forest near the Pools of--

613
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:34,695
SAM: The adjacent to the Pools of Hatafah.

614
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:40,077
TRAVIS: We didn't want to bring any extra muscle
with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're

615
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:42,607
misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry.
Forget it.

616
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:44,988
LIAM: Grog, you are our extra muscle.

617
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:48,774
TRAVIS: See! High five! Up top.

618
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:50,207
LIAM: I'm not dead.

619
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,055
TRAVIS: His hand's cold.

620
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:56,855
MATT: So you're traversing via your Wind Walk?

621
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,226
MARISHA: I guess. Are we wind walking there?

622
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,515
LAURA: (mispronouncing) Wind.

623
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:04,856
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind
walking.

624
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:06,736
LIAM: (mispronouncing) Wil Wheaton!

625
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:10,492
SAM: Hey, before we leave, real quick: Kiki.

626
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:11,637
MARISHA: Yes.

627
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:14,087
SAM: Can you send messages or anything?

628
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:17,671
MARISHA: No, man. We have been through this with
our entire group so many times.

629
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,561
SAM: It's just you're so powerful.

630
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:20,831
MARISHA: Thank you.

631
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,447
SAM: Let's go.

632
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:23,907
MARISHA: What do you need?

633
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:29,534
SAM: I would send a letter, but it'll take
weeks. So forget it. We'll be somewhere close to

634
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:31,544
somewhere with magic soon.

635
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:36,587
MARISHA: We can leave it in the hands of the
Ashari, see if they can find somebody.

636
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,481
SAM: You trust these folks?

637
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,421
MARISHA: Yeah. They're all right.

638
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:42,788
TALIESIN and MARISHA: They're not the worst.

639
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:48,464
SAM: All right, I'll scribble a little note and
say-- well, no, there's no way they can get it to--

640
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,657
it's too far! It's too far!

641
00:47:50,657 --> 00:47:56,115
TALIESIN: I was really excited to see your face
when you handed it to them and they're like, what

642
00:47:56,115 --> 00:47:57,572
are we supposed to do with this?

643
00:47:57,572 --> 00:47:59,838
SAM: Here, I'll show you, Grog.

644
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,910
TRAVIS: Write it out, bitch!

645
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:09,709
SAM: I write, a sphincter says what.

646
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:19,372
TRAVIS: A. As. Good message. That's a big word at
the front.

647
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:21,334
LAURA: You could have gotten the last one,
though.

648
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:22,725
TRAVIS: What!

649
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,166
SAM: Yes!

650
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:28,691
MATT: Pike taps you on the shoulder and is like,
"I'll teach you that later."

651
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:37,919
TALIESIN: Thank you for the Ashley Johnson
simulator. That was weirdly comforting.

652
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:40,237
MATT: Curse you, Blindspot!

653
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:41,786
TRAVIS: Yeah! Are we misting?

654
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,239
SAM: Yeah, let's do it.

655
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:47,745
LAURA: Should we eat a feast first, or should we
save that?

656
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:49,224
TALIESIN: Let's save that.

657
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:51,074
LAURA: Okay. I don't know what we're going to
find!

658
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:56,108
MATT: That's up to you guys. So preparations being
done, you gather your materials, Keyleth completes

659
00:48:56,108 --> 00:49:01,494
the Wind Walk spell and you all feel yourselves
grow slightly lighter on your toes. You

660
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:07,190
concentrate. Over the minute transformation, you
turn into your mist forms and take off in what

661
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,383
direction?

662
00:49:08,383 --> 00:49:12,125
MARISHA: Towards the Falafel Pools!

663
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,555
SAM: We wrote it down.

664
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:17,482
TALIESIN: Falafel pool is actually really tasty.

665
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:19,887
TRAVIS: Pools of Wittebak.

666
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:21,713
LAURA: Yeah! Towards the mountains!

667
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:26,111
SAM: He said "which direction?" He did not say
"Where are you going?" He said "which direction?"

668
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:28,647
LAURA: We got to look at our map.

669
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,194
MARISHA: We have it on the map!

670
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:31,555
LAURA: We have a map!

671
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:36,674
MATT: Okay! Well, you have Terrah locked down. The
Pools of Wittebak would not be on your specific map

672
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:40,931
that you acquired earlier. You can ask around
within Terrah within a brief time and figure it

673
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:51,728
out. Somewhere between 100 and 120 miles, and he
points in a specific direction. You mark the sun's

674
00:49:51,728 --> 00:49:54,291
traveling and where certain landmarks are.

675
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:58,850
MARISHA: I quickly do the math of how fast I can
travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long.

676
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,359
MATT: It's an eastward direction from where you
are.

677
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,513
TALIESIN: You did actually, legitimately point
east, too, which makes that even better.

678
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:05,758
MATT: That's weird.

679
00:50:05,758 --> 00:50:07,349
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is weird.

680
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:14,012
MATT: I'm putting points in my nature skill. Or
survival, I guess. Anyway, too many editions in my

681
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:23,967
head. (laughs) As you all take off into the
morning sky, you begin to rocket over, and you're

682
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:28,417
hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find
their way over the mountain ranges, and you get

683
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:31,953
blown a little off-course, but you maintain
concentration as best you can in that direction.

684
00:50:31,953 --> 00:50:34,136
Who is leading this venture?

685
00:50:34,136 --> 00:50:38,456
SAM: I've been there. No, I knew of it, right?

686
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:40,178
MATT: You knew of it, yeah.

687
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:42,128
SAM: But I don't know exactly where.

688
00:50:42,128 --> 00:50:48,145
LAURA: After listening to everybody, I'll lead the
way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the

689
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:53,315
forest next, too, and the house and all the
things we're looking for. I got a good look at the

690
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:56,294
map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well.

691
00:50:56,294 --> 00:51:05,120
MATT: Right. Okay, cool. I need you to go ahead
and make a survival check. Actually, for this, I'm

692
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,426
gonna say-- yeah, because it would be tracking in
the wilderness. So survival.

693
00:51:08,426 --> 00:51:14,162
LAURA: Survival? Great. Any advantage on that?

694
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:16,424
SAM: Wilderness is your favored terrain.

695
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:18,528
MATT: It's mountains, technically.

696
00:51:18,528 --> 00:51:20,033
LAURA: That's also my favored.

697
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,489
MATT: Then yeah, roll again.

698
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:23,219
TRAVIS: Because that was a one.

699
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:26,331
LAURA: Oh! So much better. 28.

700
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:33,083
MATT: Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is
tremendous when in this form, so what would have

701
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:39,621
been an extended trek on foot over a series of
days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to

702
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:47,662
a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the
opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the

703
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:54,379
edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can
see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of

704
00:51:54,379 --> 00:52:02,458
dozens and dozens of pools of water of different
sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic

705
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:07,676
cluster, where you can see bright greens that move
to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the

706
00:52:07,676 --> 00:52:12,196
various mineral deposits that have collected over
hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large

707
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:18,815
columns of smoke and steam of different chemical
colors rising out of various large pools, and at a

708
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:25,700
glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a
number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in

709
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:31,571
the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at
different pools, moving in small clusters or

710
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:37,566
gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing
and swimming through the actual pools. Some of

711
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:42,264
them are lounging around and lying. Some of them
appear to be returning, dragging things from the

712
00:52:42,264 --> 00:52:46,498
nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank.

713
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:51,911
MARISHA: This is a vacation spot. What's that
water park nearby?

714
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:53,506
LAURA: Wet 'N' Wild?

715
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:58,513
MATT: Essentially, for a few hundred years, you
get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been

716
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:06,111
a hill giant water park. You can see these large
mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have

717
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:09,937
been built into these large hill giant domiciles
onto the side of the mountain not far from the

718
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:20,055
pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering
zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down

719
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:22,097
towards the nearby forest ridge?

720
00:53:22,097 --> 00:53:23,821
LAURA: Yeah, past the pools.

721
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:28,747
MATT: All righty. You come to the forest ridge,
and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine

722
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:38,014
comes down off the precipice where the pools are.
You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more

723
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:44,200
than that. A thousand or more feet away from that
precipice before plants even begin to grow. It

724
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:50,351
looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled
up in some of these pools have made a lot of the

725
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:56,998
ground there unable to give any forest life or
sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest

726
00:53:56,998 --> 00:54:05,913
begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile
and a half, two miles across. That's what you've

727
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:07,971
got. What do you guys want to do?

728
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:16,696
LAURA: Oh man. I should try to track any
footprints in there and see if there's something

729
00:54:16,696 --> 00:54:23,403
around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit,
I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of

730
00:54:23,403 --> 00:54:24,638
miles.

731
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:33,696
MATT: If you guys begin to do a loop-over, who's
doing a quick pass over the patch of forest? All

732
00:54:33,696 --> 00:54:36,098
right, make a perception check.

733
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:49,467
LAURA: It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that
one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21.

734
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:50,905
TALIESIN: 12.

735
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:55,658
MATT: Okay. Glancing over, you don't see any major
glades or clearings. There doesn't appear to be

736
00:54:55,658 --> 00:55:03,092
any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort
of logging going on. There's no areas where trees

737
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:08,874
have been cut or cleared. It's a featureless
forest top, from what you can see.

738
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:13,256
LAURA: Can we fly down lower to where we're in
between the trees?

739
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:16,905
MATT: You can go down into the forest, if you'd
like. All right, who's going into the forest,

740
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:17,917
then?

741
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:18,846
MARISHA: I'll go.

742
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:20,409
LAURA: I'll go. All of us?

743
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:26,977
MATT: So with Pike following suit, you guys all
swoop down through the boughs of the trees and

744
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:32,301
into the center of the forest itself. Within
there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as

745
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:37,317
heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests
that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks

746
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:41,437
in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come
through from the morning sun that's rising up

747
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:46,998
higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The
mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice,

748
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:54,855
warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of
life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You

749
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:59,083
rush by what was a family of wolverine-like
creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the

750
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:04,083
wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing
past, they all scatter and run off into the

751
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:13,505
shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to
cover. For you to really super track with

752
00:56:13,505 --> 00:56:17,404
advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd
give you a regular roll if you want to try and

753
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:19,642
track in your mist form.

754
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:26,543
LAURA: Not so much tracking right now, just a
loose passover as we're going, looking for any

755
00:56:26,543 --> 00:56:34,607
kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of
things that have been traversed a lot.

756
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,751
MATT: I'd say make an investigation check.

757
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:42,073
LAURA: 27.

758
00:56:42,073 --> 00:56:51,503
MATT: 27. Begin coasting through tree after tree
through small, tiny bits of clearing that

759
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:58,411
immediately come into large clusters of trunks and
knotted branches that all merge and cluster at

760
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:04,310
different intersections. After about 20 or so
minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral

761
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:12,518
around the forest inward, out of the corner of
your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a

762
00:57:12,518 --> 00:57:18,853
quick glimpse of something that appears to be more
structured. You look back and rush over and there

763
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:28,532
you see amongst the trees what appears to be a
humble-looking two-story home. You see a small

764
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:36,789
balcony built on the second floor that goes over
one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's

765
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:42,871
not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of
the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot

766
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:45,305
more detail at this distance, though.

767
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:48,839
LAURA: Okay. We land. I land.

768
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:50,162
MARISHA: I follow.

769
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:53,115
LAURA: And behind a tree, I'm going to take form.

770
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:55,256
MATT: You take your form? Okay. So all of you land
and follow Vex?

771
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:56,455
SAM: Yeah!

772
00:57:56,455 --> 00:58:02,870
MATT: You all take a minute to go back to your
physical forms. You glance over, and there it is,

773
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:08,962
standing before you. It's very shaded in this part
of the forest. You can see a little bit of what

774
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:11,952
looks to be interior light, very faint.

775
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:16,041
TRAVIS: Like a normal person-sized dwelling?

776
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:21,342
MATT: Make a perception check.

777
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:23,310
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

778
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,732
LAURA: Yay!

779
00:58:24,732 --> 00:58:32,865
MATT: It would be a little small for you, Grog.
But you could walk in it. Proportionally, it looks

780
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:37,437
maybe like it was built for a little bit of a
smaller person.

781
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:38,891
TRAVIS: Okay.

782
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:46,301
LIAM: I want to start eyeballing the ground of the
house for any kinds of traps set out. Is that

783
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:47,629
investigation, yeah?

784
00:58:47,629 --> 00:58:48,861
MATT: That is investigation.

785
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:49,884
LIAM: 18.

786
00:58:49,884 --> 00:58:53,831
MATT: 18. Okay. So you guys begin to slowly--

787
00:58:53,831 --> 00:59:02,671
TRAVIS: Wait. Before we do, there are no random
nudist giants that have run over in this area,

788
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:05,690
right? There's nobody sees us over here taking
off?

789
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,767
TALIESIN: You're worried about giants streaking?

790
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,681
TRAVIS: Not particularly.

791
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:11,879
TALIESIN: That was <i>very</i> specific.

792
00:59:11,879 --> 00:59:15,600
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant
naked? You'll never forget it.

793
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,862
TALIESIN: I might. I don't know.

794
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:21,037
SAM: Are you suggesting we set up a perimeter?

795
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:25,489
TRAVIS: Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't
really want to go in there. I like having exits I

796
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:26,505
fit through.

797
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:33,007
LAURA: I don't want whoever it is to think that we
threaten them in any way. But then, if they

798
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:35,701
threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us,
either.

799
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,674
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from
the outside.

800
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,962
TALIESIN: Let's keep this structure standing for
now.

801
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:43,462
TRAVIS: I'll stay outside.

802
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:49,430
SAM: Are we knocking properly or are we just going
to Invisibility in and see who's in there?

803
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,493
LAURA: I feel like maybe knock properly.

804
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:56,697
TALIESIN: If you think long and hard about it,
it's not like manners have failed us very often.

805
00:59:56,697 --> 01:00:00,894
LAURA: Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or
anything weird on the way up.

806
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:03,143
MARISHA: I think we've failed at manners often.

807
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:08,839
TALIESIN: We fail at manners more often. We'll see
how this goes. We'll try being nice.

808
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,315
TRAVIS: I'll stay out here.

809
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,519
SAM: I'll go knock on the door. It seems like a
smallish door, right?

810
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:14,935
LAURA: Yeah, I'll go with you.

811
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:16,339
MATT: Okay, so what's the marching order?

812
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:18,339
SAM: I'll go first.

813
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:20,892
LIAM: Nothing perked up my spidey-sense?

814
01:00:20,892 --> 01:00:25,334
MATT: From this current glance, no. You guys are
behind a tree at a distance.

815
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,882
TRAVIS: No nude giants, right?

816
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:30,545
MATT: Currently, no, but you're keeping an eye
out.

817
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,627
LAURA: I'm walking with a smile, looking very
friendly.

818
01:00:33,627 --> 01:00:35,361
MATT: Who's leading the charge?

819
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:37,252
SAM: I'll go knock.

820
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:38,929
LAURA: I'll walk behind Scanlan.

821
01:00:38,929 --> 01:00:42,163
MATT: We have Scanlan and Vex'ahlia.

822
01:00:42,163 --> 01:00:45,256
LIAM: I'm going to go, as well, and continue to
eyeball for traps.

823
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:47,741
TALIESIN: I'll be hanging back a bit, as well.

824
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:49,758
MARISHA: I'll be comfortably back, as well.

825
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:52,484
SAM: Before we knock, what were we told was in
this thing?

826
01:00:52,484 --> 01:00:54,350
TRAVIS: The key.

827
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,794
SAM: The key. Inside a person, inside a house.

828
01:00:57,794 --> 01:01:00,123
LAURA: It's possible the person is the key; we're
not sure.

829
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,888
MATT: Is Trinket within your necklace for this?

830
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:03,138
LAURA: No, he's out.

831
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:07,125
MATT: Okay, Trinket is out alongside you. Grog?

832
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,542
LAURA: He's a very friendly bear, look at him!

833
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:10,878
TRAVIS: I'm outside the house.

834
01:01:10,878 --> 01:01:12,538
LAURA: Trinket, smile! Be friendly!

835
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:16,870
MATT: As you get across this small walkway towards
the front, as you're walking with a big smile,

836
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:21,284
Vex'ahlia, something catches your eye on the
ground right before her and you watch as she steps

837
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:24,864
forward. You reach out and grab her wrist and hold
her back before she steps down.

838
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:26,607
LAURA: What is it?

839
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:32,800
MATT: There is a large, rusted, iron bear trap
that is open that you almost stepped right into.

840
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,697
TRAVIS: That would be have been donesies.

841
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:42,687
LAURA: I was being friendly, and it almost crushed
me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for

842
01:01:42,687 --> 01:01:43,638
you.

843
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:46,050
MATT: Trinket walks up to it.

844
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,041
LAURA: No, no, be careful! Spit on it!

845
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,415
MATT: (growling)

846
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:51,226
LAURA: Can he spit? Can Trinket spit?

847
01:01:51,226 --> 01:01:59,572
MATT: (bear spitting) It's not very-- it's more of
a power drool, if you will.

848
01:01:59,572 --> 01:02:04,090
LIAM: Is it easy enough to walk around?

849
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,361
MATT: You can walk around that one, and you begin
to see what looks to be seven other ones that are

850
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:09,984
clustered around.

851
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:12,459
TALIESIN: This is probably a giant-infested
forest.

852
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:20,598
MARISHA: Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the
biggest thing you can get for a giant.

853
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:21,738
SAM: Can we evade them and get into--

854
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:34,183
MATT: You begin to walk around. Yeah, you would,
actually. As you step around one, you can see, at

855
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:39,984
the front door, there is a welcome mat that says
"welcome." As you're approaching it, you can see

856
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:45,556
the welcome mat, there's just something a little
off about it. Like, it's raised higher than the

857
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:46,862
ground should be.

858
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:48,400
TRAVIS: Willkommen.

859
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,163
MARISHA: Trapped?

860
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:55,037
LIAM: Well, I could attempt to dicker with it, but
we could just knock the door over it if we really

861
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,779
are going on manners.

862
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:59,735
TALIESIN: Double-check to make sure the door isn't
a problem, either. I'd imagine if the welcome mat

863
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:00,526
is.

864
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:04,188
LIAM: The door's going to blow up if we knock on
it? I mean, we don't have much luck with doors.

865
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:07,811
LAURA: Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the
mat up?

866
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:10,848
LIAM: Do you want to do that?

867
01:03:10,848 --> 01:03:13,700
MATT: Are you stopping her from doing that?

868
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:22,512
LIAM: Yes, I am! Let me take a look at it, please!
I've already detected it. I will attempt to disarm

869
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:24,282
it with thieves' tools, correct?

870
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:25,632
MATT: Yes.

871
01:03:25,632 --> 01:03:29,132
LIAM: That's fine. That is a 29.

872
01:03:29,132 --> 01:03:36,307
MATT: You walk over. You look and you watch.
There's a small cord that is hidden amongst the

873
01:03:36,307 --> 01:03:42,105
brush that runs from underneath the mat through a
small ring that goes up from the house, then up a

874
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:47,129
branch or vine, so it's hidden amongst them. You
look straight up about 40 feet, you see a nice,

875
01:03:47,129 --> 01:03:51,450
solid, thick trunk that is just (creaking).

876
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,185
TRAVIS: That's some Predator shit!

877
01:03:54,185 --> 01:03:56,057
MATT: Right above the door.

878
01:03:56,057 --> 01:04:02,261
TALIESIN: I feel like there's a complicated story
that goes along with all of this. I'm really

879
01:04:02,261 --> 01:04:03,477
excited by it.

880
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:06,364
MARISHA: Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of
adventure?

881
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:09,931
TALIESIN: We have found the cabin of Macaulay
Culkin!

882
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:20,109
MATT: So knowing this, you walk over and grab the
cord. Looking to see where the leverage is, you

883
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:28,589
motion to Grog to come over and hold it. You find
another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall

884
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:34,755
to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring
it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of

885
01:04:34,755 --> 01:04:40,826
the stonework, like a small pole that was placed
at the base of the house. It holds the weight of

886
01:04:40,826 --> 01:04:44,150
this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers
based on the step.

887
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:47,629
LIAM: Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good
Rube Goldberg.

888
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:50,826
TALIESIN: I was really excited by this thing. It's
a shame to dismantle it.

889
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:56,350
LAURA: It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we
can crash it down.

890
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,366
LIAM: Does the door look hinky at all?

891
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:01,315
MATT: Make an investigation check.

892
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:04,393
MARISHA: You did say kinky, right?

893
01:05:04,393 --> 01:05:06,084
LIAM: I said hinky. 18.

894
01:05:06,084 --> 01:05:12,455
MATT: 18. It does not appear to be trapped, per
se. It does appear to be locked.

895
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:14,698
LIAM: Yeah, well, I don't want to pick it.

896
01:05:14,698 --> 01:05:17,515
LAURA: I want to use a stick, and oh! Here,
Scanlan, you were going to knock.

897
01:05:17,515 --> 01:05:19,543
SAM: (chuckles) What is this stick?

898
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:21,961
LAURA: So that you don't have to touch the door in
case it's magic.

899
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:28,786
MATT: Which as a note, the door, at full height, is
about at the shoulders of most of you. You

900
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:35,502
recognize this. This is definitely a homestead
built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome.

901
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:40,889
It's still pretty big for a gnomish home, meaning
it's a little more spacious headroom, you'd

902
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:45,655
probably be able to stand in comfortably, except
for you, Grog, you're probably a little hunched.

903
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:49,757
LIAM: So it's like an ostentatious gnome door.
Little more than is needed.

904
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:56,014
SAM: Like me. I'll just rap on the door with my
knuckles.

905
01:05:56,014 --> 01:06:01,368
MATT: Okay. There is an awkward pause.

906
01:06:01,368 --> 01:06:08,310
SAM: Hello? Bidet?

907
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,600
MATT: Darin, if you want to go ahead onto the
stage, please.

908
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,846
(cheering)

909
01:06:16,846 --> 01:06:20,580
LAURA: I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear
traps.

910
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:24,635
SAM: You need this? Oh, you need this. <i>Oh!</i> I've
been goosed.

911
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:29,509
LIAM: Hey, chaotic evil necromancer gnome.

912
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:32,504
MATT: You weren't supposed to tell them.

913
01:06:32,504 --> 01:06:34,143
DARIN: I didn't.

914
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:42,839
MATT: So you hear amongst your business for the
day, out of nowhere (knocking) on the door.

915
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:44,779
SAM: Kaitiaki!

916
01:06:44,779 --> 01:06:48,215
DARIN: I open it.

917
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:54,432
MATT: Okay, you hear (clicking) what sounds like
six or seven different locks unlock on the door,

918
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:57,815
as it slowly swings open, and before them what do
they see?

919
01:06:57,865 --> 01:07:09,691
DARIN: A very small, elderly gnome, bald on top,
with a long white beard, and a bit of a distant

920
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:17,058
look in his eyes, and he looks at you and says,
are you real?

921
01:07:17,058 --> 01:07:20,728
LAURA: I think so.

922
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:30,480
DARIN: You're real? Prove it! Say that you're real
to my invisible frog companion.

923
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:37,629
SAM: I will step forward and say, hello, there.
(whispers) I'm real.

924
01:07:37,629 --> 01:07:43,557
DARIN: Yes, you're real. There is no invisible
frog companion. The voices in my head would not

925
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:49,475
have spoken to that. (stuttering) They know a
little bit better than that, but that doesn't

926
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:59,860
matter, I haven't had people here in over 35
years. (laughs) But you're here! And you're real!

927
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,248
Go away.

928
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:03,486
(laughter)

929
01:08:03,486 --> 01:08:05,727
DARIN: Demistrik, show them out.

930
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:14,490
MATT: You watch as two tiny red claws come around
the corner as these tiny, impish wings unfurl. You

931
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:20,300
watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the
doorframe. (wings beating) "Get out!"

932
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:22,446
(door slamming) and slams the door.

933
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:28,753
DARIN: And show yourself out, Demistrik. I don't
need you here, 19 years of you is more than

934
01:08:28,753 --> 01:08:30,236
enough.

935
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:34,323
MATT: You hear muffling argument through the door
as the voice goes, "I'll stay where I damn please.

936
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:37,723
"You gave me permission to stay. If anyone is going
to leave, <i>you're</i> going to leave!"

937
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:42,537
DARIN: I think you should go to Kraghammer and
become a circus performer with a little tin cup

938
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:47,770
and a little hat and say, "Oh dear, I am
Demistrik, the magical imp." That's where you

939
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,115
belong, I tell you right now.

940
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:52,877
MATT: "Sounds like a lot more fun than having to
deal with you on a daily basis, you son of a--"

941
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:57,434
DARIN: (offended cry) Language, imp!

942
01:08:57,434 --> 01:09:02,156
MATT: The door creaks open once more. "Sorry."
(door closing)

943
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:08,205
DARIN: The door creaks open again. I'm sorry, as
well. (whispering) For him, he's <i>awful</i>.

944
01:09:08,205 --> 01:09:09,771
LIAM: I stick my foot in!

945
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,768
DARIN: No!

946
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:13,498
(laughter)

947
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:18,476
LIAM: I'm really very sorry to bother you, although
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. I'm

948
01:09:18,476 --> 01:09:24,674
having a very hard time not just smiling like an
idiot. Could we trouble you just for a few

949
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:33,674
moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to
talk to you. We've come a very long way... as

950
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:37,708
farts. That's got to count for something.

951
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:41,633
LAURA: (sing-songy) We could give you some
interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long

952
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:42,539
time.

953
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:45,404
LIAM: We've done a lot, we've seen a lot, we could
tell you all about it.

954
01:09:45,404 --> 01:09:53,591
SAM: I play an old, traditional gnome song to
soften him a bit.

955
01:09:53,591 --> 01:09:55,900
MATT: Make a performance check.

956
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,624
LAURA: What is an old gnome song?

957
01:09:57,624 --> 01:09:58,841
SAM: I don't know.

958
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:00,910
(laughter)

959
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,750
SAM: 24.

960
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:07,661
MATT: It's been a long time since you've heard
music, let alone one that scratches an old memory

961
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:11,073
of childhood. It's nice.

962
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,673
TALIESIN: It's more or less whatever strikes your
fancy, to be fair.

963
01:10:13,673 --> 01:10:21,305
ALL: (humming Going to the Chapel)

964
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:24,293
MATT: You see the imp in the back going, "Ugh!
Stop that racket!"

965
01:10:24,293 --> 01:10:29,635
DARIN: You don't even appreciate music. What would
an imp song sound like? You can't say one, can

966
01:10:29,635 --> 01:10:31,888
you? Because you don't have music where you're
from.

967
01:10:31,888 --> 01:10:35,810
MATT: "I can, but it'll cause your ears to
bleed! It sounds like this." (screeching)

968
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:40,133
DARIN: I find that very entertaining.

969
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:45,729
MATT: "You're such a liar!" The imp (poof)
vanishes before you.

970
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:54,019
DARIN: He's gone. Don't worry about him. He gets a
little bit... testy, if you will.

971
01:10:54,019 --> 01:11:00,622
SAM: May we speak? May we have a moment of your
time?

972
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:06,779
DARIN: Oh, well... Very well. You can come in if
you like. Oh! Be careful, there's illusions and

973
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:10,430
thingamabobbers.

974
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:17,314
LIAM: (stammers) Sorry, that's infectious. We have
a really big guy. Are you all right with him

975
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,442
coming in? Grog, are you all right with coming
in?

976
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,917
TRAVIS: How the fuck do I get in that damn door?

977
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:24,012
LIAM: Have you not crawled on all fours before?

978
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:26,004
TALIESIN: You should try it if you haven't; it's
quite delightful.

979
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:27,421
TRAVIS: Are you lying?

980
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:29,769
TALIESIN: No. For once, no, I'm not.

981
01:11:29,769 --> 01:11:31,187
TRAVIS: Can I do an insight check on Percy?

982
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:32,623
MATT: Sure.

983
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:36,822
TRAVIS: 19.

984
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:44,207
TALIESIN: I have never actually been quite so
honest in my entire life. I think you'll find it

985
01:11:44,207 --> 01:11:45,476
very therapeutic.

986
01:11:45,476 --> 01:11:47,518
TRAVIS: I roll in on all fours.

987
01:11:47,518 --> 01:11:49,233
TALIESIN: How does it feel?

988
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,290
TRAVIS: I'm waiting for it to kick in.

989
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:57,200
TALIESIN: Crawl forward, back a bit, stretch,
downward dog, stretch.

990
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:05,700
MATT: You watch as this large, gray-skinned
mountain of a man crawls his way in. You could

991
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:20,067
duck-walk through if you really wanted to. This is
worse than Gandalf in Bag End. All fours is

992
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:24,732
probably the most comfortable means of transport
through the house. But you walk in and

993
01:12:24,732 --> 01:12:30,514
immediately, you watch as your new gnomish friend
is going around and quickly disabling small

994
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:37,530
things, putting small keys and tying off strings
and wires you saw that were set up around portions

995
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,597
of the room.

996
01:12:38,597 --> 01:12:41,715
TALIESIN: I am going to try and map this in my
head, the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.

997
01:12:41,715 --> 01:12:53,011
MATT: This place is a hoarder's den. You see
shelves and shelves of books and papers and

998
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:59,479
scrolls and stacks of them. You see on bits of
furniture and chairs more stacks of books and

999
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:06,752
sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells. Some
spilled and left and dried long ago. This place is

1000
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:10,563
very lived-in, very chaotic, and very unique.

1001
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:15,510
LIAM: The first thing that I do as we come in is I
scan the room, or rooms, for more Macaulay Culkin

1002
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,698
shenanigans.

1003
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:18,393
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1004
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,671
TALIESIN: Maculkins. I think we can just call them
Maculkins now.

1005
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:29,242
LIAM: That is a 21.

1006
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:36,989
MATT: Okay. You do see there's one portion of the
floor that he keeps avoiding, instinctually, that

1007
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:39,802
catches your attention. You're like, "why does he
keep walking around that?"

1008
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:43,303
MARISHA: What's your name, friend?

1009
01:13:43,303 --> 01:13:50,879
DARIN: Oh, well, that was taken from me a very
long time ago. I only have what they call me. You

1010
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:57,183
know, names are an odd thing, aren't they?
Sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a

1011
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:03,468
knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not
be your property, and then who you were is not who

1012
01:14:03,468 --> 01:14:07,104
you are and yet... here we are.

1013
01:14:07,104 --> 01:14:11,475
MARISHA: That oddly made way too much sense.

1014
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,995
SAM: What do they call you?

1015
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:25,537
DARIN: They call me Sprigg. There's more. They
call me Sprigg the Obnoxious.

1016
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:27,891
SAM: Sprigg the Obnoxious?

1017
01:14:27,891 --> 01:14:32,776
DARIN: Yes. It's not my given name; it was a name
that was given to me when it was given to me.

1018
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:36,126
LIAM: Did you used to be obnoxious? Because I'm
not picking that up.

1019
01:14:36,126 --> 01:14:41,152
DARIN: Oh. We're rarely who we used to be.

1020
01:14:41,152 --> 01:14:44,314
TALIESIN: Is there mercury in those pools?

1021
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:49,373
(laughter)

1022
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:52,428
DARIN: Who? Is that a friend of yours?

1023
01:14:52,428 --> 01:14:55,765
TALIESIN: I sometimes will talk to the fourth
wall. It's a thing; ignore it.

1024
01:14:55,765 --> 01:15:01,928
DARIN: It's a domicile. There has to be four
walls. If there weren't, it would be a yurt. I

1025
01:15:01,928 --> 01:15:04,060
don't live in a yurt, dear boy.

1026
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:09,425
MARISHA: I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite
nice.

1027
01:15:09,425 --> 01:15:16,242
DARIN: I have nothing against yurts. (laughs) Like
a stick that you would put in a yurt so it

1028
01:15:16,242 --> 01:15:21,554
wouldn't fall over. I would want it to fall over,
therefore, I have nothing against yurts.

1029
01:15:21,616 --> 01:15:25,144
(wheezing laughter) Demistrik!

1030
01:15:25,144 --> 01:15:32,702
MATT: The imp just appears across
the room and just goes, "Good one. That was-- I am

1031
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:34,190
"so sorry."

1032
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:41,851
LAURA: Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater
Restoration is in order?

1033
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:46,777
MATT: Pike goes, "Why?"

1034
01:15:46,777 --> 01:15:49,465
LAURA: No reason.

1035
01:15:49,465 --> 01:15:56,720
MATT: "Could I just touch your hand for a second?
Is that okay?"

1036
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,306
DARIN: (stuttering) Why?

1037
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:03,858
MATT: "Just to see if we can help your day."

1038
01:16:03,858 --> 01:16:06,560
DARIN: Do you not think that I'm real?

1039
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,801
MATT: "Probably not."

1040
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:15,121
DARIN: I assure you, I'm real. I'm here. My
companions are long gone. They were like you, like

1041
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:24,609
you, like you, and you, and you, and I'm all that
is left. You are looking into a mirror of your

1042
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:25,753
future.

1043
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:30,220
SAM: I'm going to look like you, or you're going
to look like me?

1044
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,577
MARISHA: No, I know what he means. Who were your
companions?

1045
01:16:34,577 --> 01:16:42,132
DARIN: Memories. They're all memories now. I don't
even remember their names. I remember some of

1046
01:16:42,132 --> 01:16:48,360
them, but we were heroes and now I am here.

1047
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,783
MARISHA: Oh no.

1048
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:54,439
LIAM: Were there no other gnome folk in your
party?

1049
01:16:54,439 --> 01:17:03,452
DARIN: No, there was one like you, there was a big
one, a mighty one. There was one like you, brave

1050
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,579
and kind.

1051
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,964
LAURA: That's like me! That's exactly like me.

1052
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:22,647
DARIN: There was one like you. Smart, yet sad. And
you, as well. Yeah, and I was you.

1053
01:17:22,647 --> 01:17:33,210
MATT: Pike goes, "Please?" She grabs your hand and
concentrates for a second, you watch as the holy

1054
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:40,175
symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes
through her arms into your hand. And it feels

1055
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:45,850
nice. It's like holding a freshly heated cup of
tea. And as the spell completes and she pulls

1056
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:50,069
back. "That's all. Thank you."

1057
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:55,542
DARIN: Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do
that again.

1058
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,234
MATT: "Right, okay. Okay."

1059
01:17:57,234 --> 01:18:08,995
SAM: Your companions. Not to bring up sad times.
How long ago did they go away? Perish?

1060
01:18:08,995 --> 01:18:13,606
DARIN: 37 years.

1061
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,883
SAM: And how, was it in a fight?

1062
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:18,785
DARIN: Oh, yes.

1063
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:23,530
SAM: Against a powerful entity?

1064
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:33,260
DARIN: Oh no. Against ignorance, against bravery
that should never have been. And that's why I'm

1065
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:47,973
here and they're not, because I ran, you see. I'm
your future. You'll all be gone. You and you and

1066
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:52,134
you and you and you, and you'll be left.

1067
01:18:52,134 --> 01:18:58,986
LIAM: While listening to all that, Vax slid
his hand into Keyleth's and quietly listened to

1068
01:18:58,986 --> 01:19:01,178
the whole thing.

1069
01:19:01,178 --> 01:19:11,070
DARIN: Oh, well. Perhaps we should talk of other
things. Should we?

1070
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:19,536
SAM: Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit
for you, so is there anything we can tell you from

1071
01:19:19,536 --> 01:19:22,977
the world outside that you might be curious
about?

1072
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:28,726
DARIN: The world outside? Who needs the world
outside? I have everything here, and what I need,

1073
01:19:28,726 --> 01:19:34,290
dear boy, I have taken from Kraghammer. All these
books over there, you see, those are mine. They

1074
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:40,232
should have been mine to begin with, and I took
them, and now they are mine. (wheezing laughter)

1075
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:43,649
TALIESIN: I'm going to peruse some of these
titles, quietly.

1076
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:45,218
SAM: The books, you mean?

1077
01:19:45,218 --> 01:19:50,531
DARIN: Yes. You'd like to look at the books, would
you?

1078
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:53,672
TALIESIN: I find it's the easiest way to learn
quite a bit about a person.

1079
01:19:53,672 --> 01:20:00,137
DARIN: Oh, you're very welcome to look at anything
you like. What will you give me, dear boy? I

1080
01:20:00,137 --> 01:20:16,273
require something. And yet, what do I need, living
here? Not much. Intelligence, no. Secrets, no.

1081
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:33,571
Love, no. Sadness, bravery, power. What do you
have that you would give me?

1082
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:49,679
TRAVIS: I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out
Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of

1083
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,492
these testicl-- spectacles?

1084
01:20:52,492 --> 01:21:01,114
DARIN: I seek power, dear boy, not silliness. If I
wanted silliness, I would talk to a Sun Tree. No

1085
01:21:01,114 --> 01:21:06,419
one ever should talk to a Sun Tree, they should
only listen to a Sun Tree. And so I shall say

1086
01:21:06,419 --> 01:21:14,397
again, if you would like to peruse my book and
perhaps find what you are looking for, what will

1087
01:21:14,397 --> 01:21:20,715
you give me that would bring power and redemption
into my life?

1088
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:23,303
SAM: What do you have, Grog?

1089
01:21:23,303 --> 01:21:25,673
LAURA: (whispering) Give him some ale.

1090
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:28,006
TRAVIS: But that's not fucking power.

1091
01:21:28,006 --> 01:21:31,222
LAURA: You don't know. Bet it's been a while since
he's had some of that.

1092
01:21:31,222 --> 01:21:34,698
DARIN: It seems you have powerful items.

1093
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:40,955
TRAVIS: I do. I have these Bracers of Defense.

1094
01:21:40,955 --> 01:21:47,779
DARIN: Ah, but that is strength. I require power.

1095
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:50,264
TRAVIS: (softly) Shit. Fuck.

1096
01:21:50,264 --> 01:22:03,736
TALIESIN: Well, I reach into my bag and start
cleaning a small green shard of residuum,

1097
01:22:03,736 --> 01:22:06,131
polishing it.

1098
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:16,154
DARIN: Demistrik! If you excuse me for a just--
while you look, I'll just talk to my imp. You'll

1099
01:22:16,154 --> 01:22:19,230
pardon us. (whispering) A word, Demistrik?

1100
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:22,487
MATT: "Ugh. Just one moment. What?"

1101
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:28,711
DARIN: The big one worries me. I think we should
have a code in case we have to jump him.

1102
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:31,810
MATT: "What code would you wish?"

1103
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:37,828
DARIN: Goliath grab! But we need to remember that.
We need to remember that.

1104
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,563
MATT: "Goliath grab. Good luck!"

1105
01:22:39,563 --> 01:22:47,668
DARIN: We need some sort of mnemonic device to
remember goliath grab. G, goodness gracious, grab

1106
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:52,267
that goliath. O?

1107
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:59,119
MATT: "O? Huh. I'll tell you what, I've got your
back."

1108
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:07,126
DARIN: I don't feel that at all. You're right in
front of me. How could you have my back? (wheezing chuckle)

1109
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:15,858
I got you. (laughing) Go away. So what do
you have for me? You've had ample time to look in

1110
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,839
your Bag of Holding to produce something very--

1111
01:23:18,839 --> 01:23:25,679
TRAVIS: Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that
seems to be pretty powerful.

1112
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,728
MARISHA: Oh no, Grog.

1113
01:23:28,728 --> 01:23:38,030
TRAVIS: I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small
leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you

1114
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:45,391
have any interest in this, but my experience with
these items has been very extreme. Would you care

1115
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:48,500
to take a card?

1116
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,655
DARIN: Would you care to give them to me?

1117
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:54,553
SAM: All or just one?

1118
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:57,028
TRAVIS: No, you can pick a card.

1119
01:23:57,028 --> 01:24:06,680
MATT: Make an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add
your arcana skill modifier to it.

1120
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:13,175
TALIESIN: You are a madman.

1121
01:24:13,175 --> 01:24:15,613
DARIN: 15.

1122
01:24:15,613 --> 01:24:21,718
MATT: 15. You don't recognize what he's holding in
his hands, but you immediately see the leather

1123
01:24:21,718 --> 01:24:28,654
casing around it, and your essence being able to
read certain elements of magic-- It does appear to

1124
01:24:28,654 --> 01:24:31,225
be a powerful enchantment, whatever he has
procured from the bag.

1125
01:24:31,225 --> 01:24:34,972
DARIN: Indeed. Perhaps one card for one book?

1126
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:41,262
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a
book out of all of these that you want to read?

1127
01:24:41,262 --> 01:24:48,081
DARIN: What are you looking for? What do you seek?
What knowledge? I've got it all here.

1128
01:24:48,081 --> 01:24:50,936
SAM: We seek a key.

1129
01:24:50,936 --> 01:24:55,393
LAURA: To find a very ancient goddess--

1130
01:24:55,393 --> 01:24:59,024
DARIN: Oh, don't say Ioun.

1131
01:24:59,024 --> 01:25:02,859
TALIESIN: We're not going to say Ioun.

1132
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:04,494
DARIN: You just did!

1133
01:25:04,494 --> 01:25:09,491
LIAM: Is there another name that you would like us
to use? Like a nickname instead of Ioun?

1134
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:20,471
DARIN: The Broken Goddess. I know more than Ioun,
please! Ioun. Gods, what do they know? We know

1135
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:30,409
more than they, for we exist! We live! We
adventure! They merely observe. Am I right?

1136
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:33,871
SAM: You have a point. They don't do much for us
in the day-to-day.

1137
01:25:33,871 --> 01:25:35,708
TALIESIN: Are you saying you know more than Ioun?

1138
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:38,481
DARIN: Of course I know more than Ioun.

1139
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:41,168
TALIESIN: Can you prove that you know more than
Ioun?

1140
01:25:41,168 --> 01:25:42,863
DARIN: Yes.

1141
01:25:42,863 --> 01:25:47,389
TALIESIN: So if I ask you a question that is
almost impossible to answer, you could answer it

1142
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:49,945
before Ioun could answer it?

1143
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:54,502
DARIN: Could Ioun create a rock so heavy that even
she couldn't lift it?

1144
01:25:54,502 --> 01:25:59,865
TALIESIN: Oh, please. I'm far too clever to ask
such a simple question. That's easy. I would have

1145
01:25:59,865 --> 01:26:02,875
to ask something that was very difficult to
answer.

1146
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:07,105
DARIN: I will give you your answer if you give me
a card.

1147
01:26:07,105 --> 01:26:12,289
LIAM: You know, I was just saying what a good idea
I thought it was, but I thought you were talking

1148
01:26:12,289 --> 01:26:20,304
about the entire deck, Grog. I think the entire
deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a

1149
01:26:20,304 --> 01:26:23,664
card, because that seems unpredictable to me.

1150
01:26:23,664 --> 01:26:25,587
TRAVIS: Yeah, that sounds perfect to me.

1151
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:31,390
LIAM: We're all in a small, enclosed space
together, Grog, and I like this fellow.

1152
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:37,836
LAURA: Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also
maybe slightly dangerous.

1153
01:26:37,836 --> 01:26:39,989
TALIESIN: A bit dangerous, to be fair.

1154
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:48,177
DARIN: I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes.
Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like

1155
01:26:48,177 --> 01:26:49,886
papers peddled!

1156
01:26:49,886 --> 01:26:51,814
LAURA: You're not alone at the moment.

1157
01:26:51,814 --> 01:26:53,381
DARIN: That's true!

1158
01:26:53,381 --> 01:27:04,849
LAURA: This is very true. And I'd rather not put
my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very

1159
01:27:04,849 --> 01:27:05,814
well.

1160
01:27:05,814 --> 01:27:09,507
DARIN: Some did. I'm here.

1161
01:27:09,507 --> 01:27:10,625
LAURA: Yes.

1162
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,198
DARIN: They are not.

1163
01:27:12,198 --> 01:27:15,633
LAURA: So something bad could happen, and you'd
run away, and we'd be stuck here?

1164
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:29,098
DARIN: No. 37 years. I ran away. I've been here
deciding how to live again, how <i>not</i> to run away.

1165
01:27:29,098 --> 01:27:38,254
That's what all this is about, isn't it? You can't
just hide from the world. I've done it! Done it

1166
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:50,887
for a long, long time. Maybe you being here means
that I should hide no longer. Or maybe I just have

1167
01:27:50,887 --> 01:27:59,224
an invisible frog friend. Maybe I have nothing
here, and nothing here.

1168
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:06,080
TALIESIN: Whoever has devised these contraptions
and created this safety for you is a genius. I'm

1169
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,227
not saying you're necessarily--

1170
01:28:08,227 --> 01:28:11,024
DARIN: It was both of us.

1171
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:13,315
TALIESIN: I somehow don't think so.

1172
01:28:13,315 --> 01:28:14,815
DARIN: What?

1173
01:28:14,815 --> 01:28:17,007
MATT: "It was all me."

1174
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:22,001
TALIESIN: I've had my own demons to contend with
in my life, to make me doubt my own intelligence.

1175
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:28,154
I get the sense that your compatriot-- I hate to
call it friend, here--

1176
01:28:28,154 --> 01:28:32,505
DARIN: I hate to call it friend, and yet I do.
Isn't that right, friend?

1177
01:28:32,505 --> 01:28:34,428
MATT: "Unfortunately."

1178
01:28:34,428 --> 01:28:36,485
TALIESIN: What are you doing here?

1179
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:40,748
DARIN: You can tell them.

1180
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,118
MATT: "No!"

1181
01:28:42,118 --> 01:28:43,574
DARIN: Just tell him.

1182
01:28:43,574 --> 01:28:45,632
MATT: "No! Why, because he asked me?"

1183
01:28:45,632 --> 01:28:48,542
DARIN: Yes! Be polite. They're guests in our home.

1184
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:50,619
MATT: "Oh, it's not our home."

1185
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:56,123
DARIN: 19 years you've been here, ever since your
master died trying to enter and got tricked into

1186
01:28:56,123 --> 01:29:00,143
one of my traps, and now you're here-- does that
answer your question?-- now, why don't you tell

1187
01:29:00,143 --> 01:29:02,436
him what I just said?

1188
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:07,153
MATT: "My master died trying to get in here on
one of the traps, and now I call this my home."

1189
01:29:07,153 --> 01:29:13,599
DARIN: Beautifully said. Bravo. You should be a
little performer in Kraghammer. You know what the

1190
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:24,350
reviews would be? Not very good! Shameful
behavior. Abysmal behavior from the Abyss itself!

1191
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:34,249
TALIESIN: We don't have much. Many of the things
that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you

1192
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:40,359
have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to
show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this

1193
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:44,973
would interest you, but I consider it to be of
great value.

1194
01:29:44,973 --> 01:29:47,762
MATT: So you're showing him the residuum piece?

1195
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:49,487
TALIESIN: The last piece of residuum I have.

1196
01:29:49,487 --> 01:29:55,379
MATT: All right. So this is a sliver of what looks
like green glass. It's finely polished, about that

1197
01:29:55,379 --> 01:30:02,754
thick, that long. You've read about this. You've
read that condensed residuum is very susceptible

1198
01:30:02,754 --> 01:30:12,164
to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term
magic spells. It's expensive, it's lauded, it's

1199
01:30:12,164 --> 01:30:13,739
hard to find.

1200
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:19,453
DARIN: I will use that Ring of Telekinesis to lift
it up and take a better look at it.

1201
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:24,798
MATT: You watch as it darts out of your hand and
wisps up, maybe two feet ahead of him, and slowly

1202
01:30:24,798 --> 01:30:27,462
rotates above him as he inspects it.

1203
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:29,799
TALIESIN: Impressive, but not as impressive as the
giant log.

1204
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:37,650
DARIN: Oh, yes. But is there power in this, dear
boy? Or are there only secrets? For you are

1205
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:41,027
secrets. He is power.

1206
01:30:41,027 --> 01:30:50,338
TALIESIN: I may be secrets, and that is of me, but
I believe there is power in its secret. People

1207
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:53,152
died for that. Many people.

1208
01:30:53,152 --> 01:31:02,351
DARIN: People die every day. Except me. That's my
punishment, child. I live on. I live on with my

1209
01:31:02,351 --> 01:31:05,567
shame and my intelligence and you.

1210
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:07,419
LAURA: Because of Ioun?

1211
01:31:07,419 --> 01:31:11,904
MARISHA: What's your relationship to her?

1212
01:31:11,904 --> 01:31:16,006
DARIN: What is anyone's relationship to a god?

1213
01:31:16,006 --> 01:31:17,798
MARISHA: Good question.

1214
01:31:17,798 --> 01:31:22,192
LAURA: Some of us are champions. Some of them
don't like them. Some of them worship them but

1215
01:31:22,192 --> 01:31:24,662
don't really get respect. What's yours?

1216
01:31:24,662 --> 01:31:27,805
DARIN: All of that and more.

1217
01:31:27,805 --> 01:31:30,301
LAURA: So you're a champion? Are you a champion of
Ioun?

1218
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:35,005
MARISHA: You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's
a champion of Ioun.

1219
01:31:35,005 --> 01:31:37,716
DARIN: I wouldn't say that.

1220
01:31:37,716 --> 01:31:42,467
TALIESIN: But we might, wouldn't we?

1221
01:31:42,467 --> 01:31:46,185
DARIN: Champion of Ioun?

1222
01:31:46,185 --> 01:31:50,033
MATT: (demonic cackling)

1223
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:54,420
DARIN: Are you going to start calling me Ioun's
Champion?

1224
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,456
MATT: "Only if it bothers you, Ioun's Champion!"

1225
01:31:59,522 --> 01:32:10,287
DARIN: I like it. Drat, eh? Drat. You tell them
what you know of Ioun.

1226
01:32:10,287 --> 01:32:14,189
MATT: "She's a heinous bitch who got what's coming
to her 800 years ago."

1227
01:32:14,189 --> 01:32:15,770
MARISHA: What?

1228
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:24,880
DARIN: It's a bit common, but that is his belief.
What is yours? What is your thought about Ioun?

1229
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:32,423
SAM: We know that she possesses knowledge that
could help us in our quest to save the world, and

1230
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:38,520
therefore, no matter what her personality is, she
is valuable to us.

1231
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:50,585
DARIN: And yet, is there value in saving the
world? Or should you just let it all go away?

1232
01:32:50,585 --> 01:32:53,593
LAURA: No, no, I think we should save it.

1233
01:32:53,593 --> 01:32:55,772
SAM: Yeah, we're pro-world here.

1234
01:32:55,772 --> 01:32:59,998
DARIN: Are you? That is interesting.

1235
01:32:59,998 --> 01:33:02,415
LIAM: Sprigg, you're seeking power.

1236
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:07,930
DARIN: I seek redemption. There is great power in
redemption.

1237
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:23,899
LIAM: We offer you redemption. Collaborating with
us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.

1238
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:30,193
DARIN: Excuse me. For one second. Can I speak to
you for just a second?

1239
01:33:30,193 --> 01:33:34,318
MATT: (flapping wings) "What?"

1240
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:43,527
DARIN: He's tricky. I think we should get a
mnemonic device on what we need to do if he

1241
01:33:43,527 --> 01:33:53,304
becomes too tricky. We should say, elf boy grab!
E! For egads! There's an elf, we should grab him.

1242
01:33:53,304 --> 01:33:57,530
L! Let's grab that elf boy.

1243
01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:01,361
MATT: "Right, all right." You guys can hear all of
this.

1244
01:34:01,361 --> 01:34:05,945
DARIN: F. Forsooth, I shall grab this elf boy!

1245
01:34:05,945 --> 01:34:11,303
LIAM: I'm not an elf. Not an elf.

1246
01:34:11,303 --> 01:34:14,087
MARISHA: Why do people like calling you elf boy
and elf girl?

1247
01:34:14,087 --> 01:34:21,729
LIAM: We have vaguely pointed ears. Not even
fully pointed ears. My mother was not an elf.

1248
01:34:21,729 --> 01:34:29,287
DARIN: Just a second. He's not an elf!

1249
01:34:29,287 --> 01:34:33,795
MATT: "We'll stick with the device. I've got your
back."

1250
01:34:33,795 --> 01:34:35,521
DARIN: I still don't feel it.

1251
01:34:35,521 --> 01:34:36,989
MATT: "You will."

1252
01:34:36,989 --> 01:34:44,510
DARIN: All right. Hello!

1253
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:49,518
SAM: Hi. Hi, mirror man. Listen.

1254
01:34:49,518 --> 01:34:50,976
DARIN: All right.

1255
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:54,942
SAM: Let's cut to the chase here. We need
information from you.

1256
01:34:54,942 --> 01:34:56,229
DARIN: Indeed.

1257
01:34:56,229 --> 01:34:59,044
SAM: You need something from us. Grog, give him a
card.

1258
01:34:59,044 --> 01:35:01,315
MARISHA: Wait.

1259
01:35:01,315 --> 01:35:05,493
SAM: We're dancing around this! We need this man!

1260
01:35:05,493 --> 01:35:08,054
LAURA: He took the stone! Are you taking the
stone?

1261
01:35:08,054 --> 01:35:10,880
SAM: Are you going to take the stone as a source
of power? He said it's too mysterious.

1262
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,885
LIAM: I thought we were talking about redemption.

1263
01:35:14,885 --> 01:35:20,055
DARIN: If you'll allow me. You've been very
quiet.

1264
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:28,036
MARISHA: Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now.
You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed

1265
01:35:28,036 --> 01:35:31,191
very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate.

1266
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:33,459
DARIN: That didn't make it any better, dear
child!

1267
01:35:33,459 --> 01:35:35,400
MATT: (cackling)

1268
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:43,213
DARIN: (shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst
fear in a carnation?

1269
01:35:43,213 --> 01:35:50,979
MARISHA: I've seen you in my dreams.

1270
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:54,622
DARIN: Hear that?

1271
01:35:54,622 --> 01:35:59,133
MATT: "Go get her, tiger."

1272
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:03,077
LAURA: Trinket starts chasing the imp around the
room.

1273
01:36:03,077 --> 01:36:08,455
MATT: "No!" Up into the corner, (hissing). Turns
invisible.

1274
01:36:08,455 --> 01:36:11,324
DARIN: Oh, I guess you found that unbearable!

1275
01:36:11,324 --> 01:36:13,398
SAM: That was a good pun.

1276
01:36:13,398 --> 01:36:17,145
MATT: You hear the tiniest little demonic fart by
your ear.

1277
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:22,772
LIAM: I'm also gently steering Trinket away from
the floorboard in the middle of the room as he

1278
01:36:22,772 --> 01:36:24,316
walked by.

1279
01:36:24,316 --> 01:36:30,263
MARISHA: Somehow everything you have said since
the minute we've walked into this building has

1280
01:36:30,263 --> 01:36:36,167
made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me
the most, is I understand everything you've said.

1281
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:46,582
DARIN: It should scare you the most. I was one of
you. I did what you did. 37 years ago, I did it.

1282
01:36:46,582 --> 01:36:52,030
And we fought, and we fought, and they were right
here. They were right here!

1283
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:54,116
SAM: Who is they?

1284
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,520
DARIN: My companions.

1285
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,402
SAM: And who were you fighting against? You, we?

1286
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:01,067
TRAVIS: Vecna.

1287
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:02,801
DARIN: No.

1288
01:37:02,801 --> 01:37:04,168
SAM: Gods?

1289
01:37:04,168 --> 01:37:11,268
DARIN: It was silly. It was hobgoblins. It should
never have happened. It was a simple fight, and

1290
01:37:11,268 --> 01:37:19,602
they died, and I ran, and I can't even remember
their names.

1291
01:37:19,602 --> 01:37:21,900
LIAM: Sprigg.

1292
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,297
DARIN: Yes?

1293
01:37:23,297 --> 01:37:30,572
LIAM: Would you like to be needed again? Maybe
it's time to stop running.

1294
01:37:30,572 --> 01:37:34,125
DARIN: What would I do?

1295
01:37:34,169 --> 01:37:42,940
MARISHA: We can grant you power in items, but I
don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all

1296
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:50,847
of us can speak a little bit to the fact that
items don't grant you as much inner power as you

1297
01:37:50,847 --> 01:37:52,320
expect them to.

1298
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,702
LAURA: Unless they're boots. And then they're
amazing.

1299
01:37:54,702 --> 01:38:01,331
MARISHA: Unless they're very highly argued and
debated-upon boots, in which case I still think

1300
01:38:01,331 --> 01:38:02,479
the argument--

1301
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,287
DARIN: Are we about to have a debate about boots?
I'm against them! Your turn.

1302
01:38:06,287 --> 01:38:09,019
LAURA: I am for them, usually.

1303
01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:12,333
DARIN: Continue, Councilor, but watch yourself.

1304
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:17,783
LAURA: Have you any idea where the key to Ioun
is?

1305
01:38:17,783 --> 01:38:20,488
DARIN: In the boots? We're talking about boots,
are we?

1306
01:38:20,488 --> 01:38:25,232
LAURA: Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's
location. Specifically.

1307
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:32,966
DARIN: I think the key might be here, but I don't
really know.

1308
01:38:32,966 --> 01:38:42,783
LIAM: Sprigg, the world is on the brink right now.
It's worse than hobgoblins. We've come here in

1309
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:51,276
great need, and the world is in great need, and
the power that I offer you is making a

1310
01:38:51,276 --> 01:38:52,636
difference.

1311
01:38:52,636 --> 01:39:00,217
DARIN: Then make me believe in Ioun. We'll make a
difference together.

1312
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:02,474
LIAM: Make you believe?

1313
01:39:02,474 --> 01:39:07,183
MARISHA: Of course he believes. Believing is not
the question.

1314
01:39:07,183 --> 01:39:13,895
DARIN: Books everywhere, you see. That's something
you can hold. That's something you can learn.

1315
01:39:13,895 --> 01:39:18,931
MARISHA: That's something that's tangible. Ioun is
distant.

1316
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:24,250
LAURA: But she could be tangible if you'd help us
find her.

1317
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:32,120
MARISHA: What if we have found her? What if Sprigg
is right? What if all of the information that Ioun

1318
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,384
knows is here in Sprigg?

1319
01:39:34,384 --> 01:39:39,983
TALIESIN: I really want to look at these. I want
to look at these books really quickly. I'm having

1320
01:39:39,983 --> 01:39:44,378
a moment. I just want to start looking at these
titles. What are these books?

1321
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:49,094
MATT: You go over and start walking towards the
edge of the nearest bookcase, and all of you at

1322
01:39:49,094 --> 01:40:01,949
once-- everyone but Sprigg, actually-- suddenly
hear a voice come through, filling your mind,

1323
01:40:01,949 --> 01:40:07,684
filling your consciousness, filling your ears.
Sourceless, delivered to your consciousness

1324
01:40:07,684 --> 01:40:20,253
directly. "Thank you for showing me where he is."
And that's where we're going to take a break.

1325
01:40:20,253 --> 01:40:24,047
LIAM: Fuck!

1326
01:40:24,047 --> 01:40:30,159
MARISHA: How? We don't have the eye! What a cock!

1327
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:35,086
TALIESIN: Oh my god, he's been in the troll dick
all along.

1328
01:40:35,086 --> 01:40:37,166
MARISHA: It's always been the troll dick.

1329
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:42,402
MATT: All right, we'll be in just a minute. We'll
be back here in a few minutes, guys. For the

1330
01:40:42,402 --> 01:40:50,342
Twitch giveaway, we have this awesome Peruvian
walnut dice tray, leather interior. It's very

1331
01:40:50,342 --> 01:40:54,456
nice. It's the same type that I have, actually,
back here, which is nice. Giving it away for

1332
01:40:54,456 --> 01:41:00,917
somebody in the Twitch chat, so run on over, and
the code for the evening is Sprigg. S-P-R-I...

1333
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:02,354
DARIN: G-G.

1334
01:41:02,354 --> 01:41:03,788
MATT: G-G. Double G.

1335
01:41:03,788 --> 01:41:08,364
DARIN: S-P-R-I-G-G spells Sprigg, ladies and
gentlemen, if you want to win that valuable

1336
01:41:08,364 --> 01:41:09,502
prize.

1337
01:41:09,502 --> 01:41:13,324
MATT: So pay attention in the chat. When it's time
to, go ahead and enter Sprigg into the chat, and

1338
01:41:13,324 --> 01:41:16,709
one lucky winner will be announced when we get
back here. See you guys in a few minutes!

1339
01:41:16,709 --> 02:01:14,980
[break]

1340
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:18,326
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All
right, so first and foremost, we have our winner

1341
02:01:18,365 --> 02:01:26,614
for the dice tray from Wyrmwood. That is our
friend k0sn1ght, spelled in the way that you spell your

1342
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:35,401
XBox Live name: k0sn1ght. Congratulations, you are
the winner. Go ahead and contact Danoba and get

1343
02:01:35,401 --> 02:01:38,990
your information and we'll get that shipped out to
you. Bringing us back in.

1344
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:40,908
TALIESIN: That was fast.

1345
02:01:40,908 --> 02:01:48,297
MATT: Last we left off, you all, almost all of
you, heard a singular familiar voice. The low,

1346
02:01:48,297 --> 02:01:58,644
gravelly undead voice of The Whispered One fills
your minds, saying, "Thank you for showing me

1347
02:01:58,644 --> 02:02:08,441
"where he is." In that moment where you all pause
in place, you hear a series of simultaneous sounds

1348
02:02:08,441 --> 02:02:18,414
(arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow
bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously

1349
02:02:18,414 --> 02:02:20,914
at Sprigg.

1350
02:02:20,914 --> 02:02:23,712
MARISHA: Do I have time for a reaction?

1351
02:02:23,712 --> 02:02:26,448
MATT: No, you do not. This is a surprise round.

1352
02:02:26,448 --> 02:02:28,685
LIAM: This is the sound of bolts, no.

1353
02:02:28,685 --> 02:02:31,779
TRAVIS: It's all right, he can't die. It's cool.
We're all right.

1354
02:02:31,779 --> 02:02:37,377
MATT: So that first one is a 24. What's your armor
class?

1355
02:02:37,377 --> 02:02:39,679
DARIN: My armor class is 19.

1356
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:49,860
MATT: Okay! So you take 23 points of piercing
damage.

1357
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:55,650
DARIN: Okay. Oh, there we go.

1358
02:02:55,650 --> 02:03:01,345
MATT: That's 17. That misses you. It strikes your
shoulder and glances off. One bolt sinks into your

1359
02:03:01,345 --> 02:03:06,019
chest and you look down and you see it's this big,
long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from

1360
02:03:06,019 --> 02:03:10,238
the side of where your shoulder and pec is.
Another one rushes by and glances off your other

1361
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:11,815
shoulder. The third one--

1362
02:03:11,815 --> 02:03:13,503
DARIN: Well, this is different.

1363
02:03:13,503 --> 02:03:26,139
MATT: That hits. That's a 25. That's 23 points of
piercing damage.

1364
02:03:26,139 --> 02:03:28,737
TALIESIN: Oh no.

1365
02:03:28,737 --> 02:03:33,098
MATT: That one actually misses; a six and a one.
It slams into one of the nearby books right behind

1366
02:03:33,098 --> 02:03:45,354
you, barely moving past your cheek. Fifth one,
that is a 19 exactly, so you take 24 points of

1367
02:03:45,354 --> 02:03:46,386
damage.

1368
02:03:46,386 --> 02:03:48,059
LAURA: How many fucking bolts are there?

1369
02:03:48,059 --> 02:03:49,327
MARISHA: 24?

1370
02:03:49,327 --> 02:03:57,770
MATT: They're all sneak attack. And that is 20.

1371
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,337
DARIN: Another one?

1372
02:03:59,337 --> 02:04:00,471
MATT: Another one.

1373
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:01,619
DARIN: Okay.

1374
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:07,594
MATT: That one's going to be 26 points of piercing
damage.

1375
02:04:07,594 --> 02:04:09,228
DARIN: I'm gone.

1376
02:04:09,228 --> 02:04:14,964
MATT: You guys watch as all these bolts (arrows
firing and impacting) into Sprigg's body and

1377
02:04:14,964 --> 02:04:21,099
Sprigg falls back, unconscious on the side of the
room. I'm going to bring out a map now.

1378
02:04:21,099 --> 02:04:24,643
DARIN: Fly, you fools!

1379
02:04:24,643 --> 02:04:27,976
MARISHA: (yelling) No, Sprigg!

1380
02:04:27,976 --> 02:04:34,065
SAM: Darin, it was really great having you on.
Thanks so much.

1381
02:04:34,065 --> 02:04:35,580
LAURA: Whoa, cool!

1382
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:38,648
SAM: Whoa, this is a cute house!

1383
02:04:38,648 --> 02:04:41,654
LAURA: Oh, I can't see inside of it.

1384
02:04:41,654 --> 02:04:44,436
MATT: Moving the top floor off.

1385
02:04:44,436 --> 02:04:46,608
LIAM: There's crates of apples!

1386
02:04:46,608 --> 02:04:51,488
SAM: There's a sack of something in the corner! Oh
my god, how are we all going to fit in there?

1387
02:04:51,488 --> 02:05:02,033
MATT: Sprigg is currently unconscious on the
ground there. Percival was there talking. Trinket

1388
02:05:02,033 --> 02:05:03,338
is off to the side.

1389
02:05:03,338 --> 02:05:05,455
LAURA: Trinket! Where's the imp?

1390
02:05:05,455 --> 02:05:14,679
MATT: The imp is not currently visible. Pike would
be over on the side here. Keyleth, Vax, where

1391
02:05:14,679 --> 02:05:17,707
would you guys see yourselves right now? Actually,
tell me where you would be. I think that's what

1392
02:05:17,707 --> 02:05:18,902
I'm trying to ask.

1393
02:05:18,902 --> 02:05:20,903
LIAM: I would be right next to Keyleth because I
was holding her hand.

1394
02:05:20,903 --> 02:05:22,737
MATT: As I chuck you onto the ground.

1395
02:05:22,737 --> 02:05:24,711
LIAM: It's all right. It's fine.

1396
02:05:24,859 --> 02:05:29,102
MATT: Yeah, comes back in a day later. All right,
cool. So you're there holding that. Scanlan, where

1397
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:30,047
would you be?

1398
02:05:30,047 --> 02:05:31,413
SAM: Near Sprigg-ish.

1399
02:05:31,413 --> 02:05:33,459
MATT: All right, so I'll put you right there next
to the scroll in the ground.

1400
02:05:33,459 --> 02:05:39,510
LIAM: And Matt? Could you touch on the map where
the bad man touched you? No, where the bad

1401
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:40,766
floorboard is?

1402
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:43,975
MATT: Yes, actually, I can do that.

1403
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:46,118
LIAM: None of you know this.

1404
02:05:46,118 --> 02:05:49,954
MATT: None of you know this, except for you, which
is actually why I'm not going to show you. You

1405
02:05:49,954 --> 02:05:52,151
know how to avoid it, but nobody else knows where
it is.

1406
02:05:52,151 --> 02:05:56,058
LAURA: Where is the front door?

1407
02:05:56,058 --> 02:05:58,043
MATT: The front door is right there.

1408
02:05:58,043 --> 02:06:00,292
LIAM: There, over by Grog on your right.

1409
02:06:00,292 --> 02:06:02,918
SAM: These trees need to move.

1410
02:06:02,918 --> 02:06:09,625
LAURA: I know, these trees are a pain in our
butts. Oh no.

1411
02:06:09,625 --> 02:06:12,267
SAM: There's cloaked men everywhere

1412
02:06:12,267 --> 02:06:18,077
MATT: You watch as one that was up in the stairs
vanishes up top.

1413
02:06:18,077 --> 02:06:22,064
TRAVIS: Oh, he actually made it upstairs?

1414
02:06:22,064 --> 02:06:26,239
MATT: He fired, and then ducked up there. I need
everyone to roll initiative.

1415
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:27,659
SAM: Initiative?

1416
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:30,351
MATT: Yes. Including you, even though you're on
the ground.

1417
02:06:30,351 --> 02:06:35,901
MARISHA: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did
all right.

1418
02:06:35,901 --> 02:06:40,668
SAM: I don't trust Gil. I never roll on his dice.

1419
02:06:40,668 --> 02:06:48,185
LIAM: Rarely. I have, but I got my Matt Colville
meteorite.

1420
02:06:48,185 --> 02:06:49,279
MATT: 25 to 20?

1421
02:06:49,349 --> 02:06:50,453
TALIESIN: 23.

1422
02:06:50,453 --> 02:06:51,599
LIAM: 20.

1423
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:52,629
TRAVIS: 22.

1424
02:06:52,629 --> 02:07:06,605
MATT: Oh wow, so we have Percy, we have Grog, and
Vax. Okay, 20 to 15?

1425
02:07:06,605 --> 02:07:08,361
SAM: 19.

1426
02:07:08,361 --> 02:07:10,055
LAURA: Should somebody roll for Pike?

1427
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:12,132
MATT: Yes, actually. Okay, yeah.

1428
02:07:12,132 --> 02:07:15,802
DARIN: Also a 19.

1429
02:07:15,802 --> 02:07:17,032
MATT: Okay.

1430
02:07:17,032 --> 02:07:19,456
TALIESIN: You've got a very low initiative bonus.

1431
02:07:19,456 --> 02:07:25,018
MATT: All righty, anybody else?

1432
02:07:25,018 --> 02:07:26,488
LAURA: 13.

1433
02:07:26,488 --> 02:07:34,713
MARISHA: 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12.

1434
02:07:34,713 --> 02:07:36,329
TALIESIN: Peace out.

1435
02:07:36,329 --> 02:07:38,754
SAM: NKOTB.

1436
02:07:38,754 --> 02:07:42,505
MARISHA: 12 initiative, Wu Tang out.

1437
02:07:42,505 --> 02:07:44,612
TALIESIN: That's our next shirt.

1438
02:07:44,612 --> 02:07:48,819
SAM: Quidd, everyone. Quidd.

1439
02:07:48,819 --> 02:07:50,068
LAURA: Quidd.

1440
02:07:50,068 --> 02:07:51,827
LIAM: Quid pro quo.

1441
02:07:51,827 --> 02:07:55,761
MATT: All right, so top of the combat round. The
surprise round is done, you watch Sprigg fall to

1442
02:07:55,761 --> 02:07:59,980
the ground, bolts sticking out of the side of the
neck, the shoulder, and the body. Unconscious, now

1443
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:05,490
beginning to pool blood underneath where he's
bleeding out, and you glance around and you see a

1444
02:08:05,552 --> 02:08:12,053
series of shaded figures in the windows that all
dart out of the way.

1445
02:08:12,053 --> 02:08:14,545
MARISHA: Cowards.

1446
02:08:14,545 --> 02:08:15,914
LAURA: Dicks.

1447
02:08:15,914 --> 02:08:20,684
SAM: Oh, they left. The fight's over, everyone.

1448
02:08:20,684 --> 02:08:23,264
MATT: Percy, you're up first.

1449
02:08:23,264 --> 02:08:41,728
TALIESIN: Wow, this is a lot that happened. I'm
going to click my boots, and I'm going to run up

1450
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,737
the wall and run upstairs.

1451
02:08:43,737 --> 02:08:53,264
MATT: Which, for the purposes of this, I will
place the upstairs over here. So as you dart up,

1452
02:08:53,264 --> 02:09:00,684
Percival, you run up the stairway there where the
one guy you saw was standing.

1453
02:09:00,684 --> 02:09:02,172
TALIESIN: Is he right there?

1454
02:09:02,172 --> 02:09:07,557
MATT: Yeah, he ducked out of the way, and there's
also one figure that you recognize from the

1455
02:09:07,618 --> 02:09:13,503
Shadowfell earlier. You see one of the ghastly
creatures that was darting through the ruins

1456
02:09:13,503 --> 02:09:20,402
leaping from from rooftop to rooftop. Its skin is
grayish and long, its limbs lanky, its fingers

1457
02:09:20,402 --> 02:09:24,444
curled into claws, and this long tongue dangling
from his jaws, it's getting ready to run down the

1458
02:09:24,444 --> 02:09:26,995
stairs as you charge him, and it goes (growls).

1459
02:09:26,995 --> 02:09:28,639
TALIESIN: Manners! Action Surge!

1460
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:32,760
MARISHA: Yay, Manners!

1461
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:34,380
MATT: Okay then.

1462
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:36,806
MARISHA: We're bad at manners, until now!

1463
02:09:36,806 --> 02:09:40,430
MATT: All righty, so what's the saving throw on
that one?

1464
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:49,399
TALIESIN: It's a DC 20 strength. Oh, I'm sorry,
no. Never mind. It's an attack roll.

1465
02:09:49,399 --> 02:09:52,123
MATT: Okay, so you have to roll first to see if
you hit it.

1466
02:09:52,123 --> 02:09:58,263
TALIESIN: 18.

1467
02:09:58,263 --> 02:10:05,224
MATT: 18? Yeah, that definitely hits. It hits, and
you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in

1468
02:10:05,224 --> 02:10:10,524
the direction of the creature. Pulls its claws back,
slams into its chest, and then unravels.

1469
02:10:10,524 --> 02:10:18,594
It falls to the ground, prone, unable
to move, right there in the middle of the floor.

1470
02:10:18,594 --> 02:10:21,164
TALIESIN: Just making sure that I can do this.

1471
02:10:21,164 --> 02:10:23,133
MATT: Was that your action, there, doing that?

1472
02:10:23,133 --> 02:10:28,291
TALIESIN: That was my action surge. I can only do
one round. Just seeing if I have anything at a bonus that

1473
02:10:28,341 --> 02:10:29,430
I can do.

1474
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:31,108
MATT: You spent your action--?

1475
02:10:31,108 --> 02:10:39,008
TALIESIN: My action, I activated my boots. My
action surge activating that. Do I have anything I

1476
02:10:39,008 --> 02:10:40,843
can do with a bonus action?

1477
02:10:40,843 --> 02:10:42,204
MATT: Not really.

1478
02:10:42,204 --> 02:10:50,046
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn to the other guy and
pull the ripcord on the glove angrily. (revving)

1479
02:10:50,046 --> 02:10:53,350
MATT: You load up Diplomacy. Good. That's your
turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

1480
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:56,477
TRAVIS: Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage?

1481
02:10:56,477 --> 02:10:57,687
MATT: Yes, you may.

1482
02:10:57,687 --> 02:11:00,040
TRAVIS: And he fell where?

1483
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:03,765
MATT: He fell right there, on the ground,
currently bleeding out.

1484
02:11:03,765 --> 02:11:11,595
TRAVIS: Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a--
should I shove a health potion in his throat?

1485
02:11:11,595 --> 02:11:13,359
LAURA: Well, we've got healers.

1486
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:19,674
TRAVIS: Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy
went.

1487
02:11:19,674 --> 02:11:25,181
MATT: You rage-run just past Percival and you see
there's one creature bound on the ground and

1488
02:11:25,181 --> 02:11:29,919
there's another guy who's there with his crossbow,
he's trying to reload, who sees Percival and is

1489
02:11:29,996 --> 02:11:32,346
getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front.

1490
02:11:32,346 --> 02:11:33,733
TALIESIN: Smash him!

1491
02:11:33,733 --> 02:11:34,696
TRAVIS: Do you mind?

1492
02:11:34,696 --> 02:11:35,753
TALIESIN: Please!

1493
02:11:35,753 --> 02:11:37,231
TRAVIS: Yeah. (rage noises)

1494
02:11:37,231 --> 02:11:39,762
MATT: Go for it. Roll for a double attack.

1495
02:11:39,762 --> 02:11:48,199
TRAVIS: Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master.
Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot.

1496
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:53,432
30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32.

1497
02:11:53,432 --> 02:11:55,684
MATT: 32 hits. Second attack?

1498
02:11:55,684 --> 02:12:00,639
TRAVIS: 31.

1499
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:02,690
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.

1500
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:10,775
TRAVIS: So they're not giants. So I just roll a
d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25.

1501
02:12:10,775 --> 02:12:12,688
MATT: 25 damage on the first hit?

1502
02:12:12,688 --> 02:12:14,829
TRAVIS: On the first one. Second one.

1503
02:12:14,829 --> 02:12:17,417
LAURA: 24.

1504
02:12:17,417 --> 02:12:19,222
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1505
02:12:19,222 --> 02:12:26,093
MATT: Nice. With your hammer, two hands, whack
right across the side of its head. You see the jaw

1506
02:12:26,093 --> 02:12:32,676
unhinge from the side. As he pulls back, it's
hanging loosely there, and the second hit you

1507
02:12:32,676 --> 02:12:36,419
clock right in the side of the temple, and it
nearly goes unconscious, and picks itself up

1508
02:12:36,419 --> 02:12:41,677
again, gets its crossbow ready. It's still
holding. It's not down yet, but it's hurt badly.

1509
02:12:41,677 --> 02:12:46,958
You can see now, up close, you can see these
figures, they're dressed in very, very tight black

1510
02:12:46,958 --> 02:12:50,719
leathers, cloaks enshrouding their body, the hood
is still up, but you've knocked it back. There you

1511
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:59,764
see a human male in his late 40s, early 50s, the
head shaved completely bald, a tattoo of black

1512
02:12:59,764 --> 02:13:02,857
tendrils around the left eye, and the left eye is
missing from the socket.

1513
02:13:02,857 --> 02:13:06,174
TRAVIS: Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my
turn.

1514
02:13:06,174 --> 02:13:08,522
MATT: That's your turn. All right. Grog's done.
Vax, you're up.

1515
02:13:08,522 --> 02:13:12,955
LIAM: Okay, let's talk this out. Click the Boots
of Haste. I think, with 120 feet of movement, I

1516
02:13:12,955 --> 02:13:19,470
can blur up the stairs to where Percy is in
probably 50 or 60 feet. And then finish that

1517
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:29,407
movement and go past the guy, out the window, with
all of my movement in 120 feet or less. Okay, so

1518
02:13:29,407 --> 02:13:30,559
I'm doing that.

1519
02:13:30,559 --> 02:13:33,120
MATT: There's also a window here, a window here,
and a window here. Just so you guys know, and a

1520
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,538
window here, if you wanted.

1521
02:13:34,538 --> 02:13:40,211
LIAM: Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs,
shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the

1522
02:13:40,211 --> 02:13:41,297
window.

1523
02:13:41,297 --> 02:13:43,788
MATT: You're on the balcony now, looking right about
here.

1524
02:13:43,788 --> 02:13:45,506
LIAM: Do I already see those guys?

1525
02:13:45,506 --> 02:13:48,276
MATT: Make a perception check.

1526
02:13:48,276 --> 02:13:51,998
LIAM: 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot.

1527
02:13:51,998 --> 02:13:57,174
MATT: 19 plus 14? Yeah, you do see them. And you
glance down, you can see they're hiding amongst

1528
02:13:57,174 --> 02:14:02,116
bushes, and they're specifically stealthed. But
you're keen of eye enough to see where they're

1529
02:14:02,116 --> 02:14:02,964
placed.

1530
02:14:02,964 --> 02:14:11,917
LIAM: I stealth, hide. Bonus action to hide. I'm
going to use Luck. That's better. 27.

1531
02:14:11,917 --> 02:14:15,415
MATT: 27. Okay. You're not sure if they see you or
not.

1532
02:14:15,415 --> 02:14:20,721
LIAM: All right, then from this spot, if they're
in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of

1533
02:14:20,721 --> 02:14:21,817
them.

1534
02:14:21,817 --> 02:14:29,997
MATT: Right now, you are currently up here. So you
glance off and you can barely see one that's over

1535
02:14:29,997 --> 02:14:33,342
the edge of the roof right there. That's the only
one you can see.

1536
02:14:33,342 --> 02:14:37,514
LIAM: But I can see them and I can ignore
three-quarters cover because of Sharpshooter.

1537
02:14:37,514 --> 02:14:43,663
MATT: So you barely see the edge of one there.
Sharpshooter. I'd say yeah, you can. You can hit

1538
02:14:43,663 --> 02:14:45,075
both, if you want.

1539
02:14:45,075 --> 02:14:51,777
LIAM: So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try
to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak

1540
02:14:51,777 --> 02:14:57,123
attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.

1541
02:14:57,123 --> 02:15:03,203
MATT: 28. He does not see you. So you have
advantage on that if you want to roll again.

1542
02:15:03,203 --> 02:15:05,187
LIAM: Right. Natural 20.

1543
02:15:05,187 --> 02:15:08,916
TALIESIN: Turn him into paste.

1544
02:15:08,916 --> 02:15:24,593
LIAM: Okay. (counting)

1545
02:15:24,593 --> 02:15:25,714
SAM: Did Pike roll?

1546
02:15:25,714 --> 02:15:27,016
MATT: Pike did.

1547
02:15:27,016 --> 02:15:28,419
LAURA: What did she get?

1548
02:15:28,419 --> 02:15:30,354
MATT: 11. Typical Pike.

1549
02:15:30,354 --> 02:15:31,934
MARISHA: She's after me.

1550
02:15:31,934 --> 02:15:37,324
LAURA: Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan.
He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up

1551
02:15:37,324 --> 02:15:38,555
before.

1552
02:15:38,555 --> 02:15:43,527
LIAM: So that one is 60 on that guy.

1553
02:15:43,527 --> 02:15:45,454
MATT: 60 points of damage?

1554
02:15:45,454 --> 02:15:47,297
LIAM: Yes, and I bamf there.

1555
02:15:47,297 --> 02:15:56,582
MATT: As you chuck the dagger, like right towards
where the center of the shoulderblades connect in

1556
02:15:56,582 --> 02:16:00,622
the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow
that he had drops to the ground and he crumples

1557
02:16:00,622 --> 02:16:05,310
over on top of it, but he slowly starts getting to
his feet out of the bushes. He looks really hurt,

1558
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:09,274
but he's still standing. And you appear right next
to him there.

1559
02:16:09,274 --> 02:16:16,572
LIAM: So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I
have action-action as a paladin. And action.

1560
02:16:16,572 --> 02:16:18,170
MATT: You have attack-attack as a paladin.

1561
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:21,260
LIAM: Attack-attack as a paladin. And then my
bonus action. That was the first of attack-attack,

1562
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:24,921
so now I'll just do a regular attack, which is a
20--

1563
02:16:24,921 --> 02:16:30,147
LAURA: (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those
boots back, I'm just so glad.

1564
02:16:30,147 --> 02:16:31,533
LIAM: 30.

1565
02:16:31,533 --> 02:16:33,682
MATT: 30 hits.

1566
02:16:33,682 --> 02:16:42,375
LIAM: That is a ten and I'm going to pump him full
of poison. He has to make a DC check on 15.

1567
02:16:42,375 --> 02:16:46,829
MATT: That is a seven. No. Four plus three.

1568
02:16:46,829 --> 02:16:56,046
LIAM: So he also gets, that was ten plus 14 total.
20 total, between the dagger and the poison.

1569
02:16:56,046 --> 02:17:01,796
MATT: So the second dagger, you shiv him in the
side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy

1570
02:17:01,796 --> 02:17:06,879
crossbow and try and pull away, and as soon as the poison
through him he goes, (gurgles) and you can see

1571
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:10,998
blood vomit down the front of his chest, his eyes
roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground.

1572
02:17:10,998 --> 02:17:15,389
LIAM: And there's another guy there who can see
me, right?

1573
02:17:15,389 --> 02:17:19,233
MATT: Yeah, and he's hidden, but he's like
(scared, heavy breathing).

1574
02:17:19,233 --> 02:17:21,636
LIAM: Whisper.

1575
02:17:21,636 --> 02:17:24,757
MATT: Okay, he's trying to see that you're not
being seen.

1576
02:17:24,757 --> 02:17:41,528
LIAM: That is 31. Yeah, okay. So that is two plus
eight is ten, plus psychic damage. 18. I'm going

1577
02:17:41,528 --> 02:17:43,284
to bamf there with Whisper.

1578
02:17:43,284 --> 02:17:54,077
MATT: Okay. All righty. You hit him and you stand
there. You're right in front of him now. All

1579
02:17:54,077 --> 02:18:02,547
righty. That ends your go. As you appear over on
the other side, you realize that over in the

1580
02:18:02,547 --> 02:18:08,251
clearing there, there is another one of the robed
figures, this one clutching a long, black, smooth

1581
02:18:08,251 --> 02:18:11,595
staff that crooks over in the front that looks
like a hand holding an eye.

1582
02:18:11,595 --> 02:18:13,236
MARISHA: What? Where? Who?

1583
02:18:13,236 --> 02:18:17,310
There <i>were</i> more of them!

1584
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:19,370
LIAM: But you guys don't know that yet.

1585
02:18:19,370 --> 02:18:23,575
MATT: You guys don't know that yet, just him.
Ending your turn, Vax. That guy on the ground is

1586
02:18:23,575 --> 02:18:30,686
going to try and break free. That is a 17. DC 20?

1587
02:18:30,686 --> 02:18:31,880
TALIESIN: DC 20.

1588
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:37,734
MATT: It struggles on the ground and can't seem to
break free of the current magic manacles that hold

1589
02:18:37,734 --> 02:18:39,089
it in place.

1590
02:18:39,089 --> 02:18:45,347
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's stuck. I love that we have
floors!

1591
02:18:45,347 --> 02:18:52,273
MATT: Another one of these darts through the
window, leaps across the way, right in front of

1592
02:18:52,273 --> 02:18:57,902
Sprigg, and you being right there, Scanlan, goes,
(angry hissing) and lashes out at you.

1593
02:18:57,902 --> 02:18:59,516
MARISHA: He's going for Sprigg!

1594
02:18:59,516 --> 02:19:01,827
TALIESIN: He's going for Scanlan.

1595
02:19:01,827 --> 02:19:04,367
MARISHA: But because Scanlan's over Sprigg!

1596
02:19:04,367 --> 02:19:05,712
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

1597
02:19:05,712 --> 02:19:09,369
MATT: Makes two claw strikes at you. First one is
16 to hit.

1598
02:19:09,369 --> 02:19:10,373
SAM: Yes.

1599
02:19:10,373 --> 02:19:15,527
MATT: All right. You suffer eight points of
slashing damage, and I need you make a

1600
02:19:15,527 --> 02:19:17,255
constitution saving throw.

1601
02:19:17,255 --> 02:19:23,014
SAM: Oh boy. Not great. 16.

1602
02:19:23,014 --> 02:19:24,968
MATT: 16, okay.

1603
02:19:24,968 --> 02:19:26,477
SAM: Is it magical?

1604
02:19:26,477 --> 02:19:32,310
MATT: No, it is not magical, but you feel this
pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your

1605
02:19:32,310 --> 02:19:35,254
system, and you just manage to shrug it off.

1606
02:19:35,254 --> 02:19:37,897
(relieved cheering)

1607
02:19:37,897 --> 02:19:41,907
MATT: The other claw comes towards you.
That's a natural 20.

1608
02:19:41,907 --> 02:19:44,478
SAM: Natural 20 to hit, sure.

1609
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:53,166
MATT: That is 30 points of slashing damage on the
second hit. Make another saving throw, please.

1610
02:19:53,166 --> 02:19:59,864
SAM: That's 17.

1611
02:19:59,864 --> 02:20:05,085
MATT: 17. The second strike hits you and you feel
as the side of your torso gets torn out of the

1612
02:20:05,085 --> 02:20:09,023
side, the blood splatters onto Sprigg, who's already
bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome

1613
02:20:09,023 --> 02:20:13,117
blood. As you reach for your side, however, it
does not take effect; you manage to shrug off.

1614
02:20:13,117 --> 02:20:19,059
TRAVIS: Those are constitution saving throws?

1615
02:20:19,059 --> 02:20:24,730
MATT: Yeah. That ends the shadow ghast's turn.
Sprigg, I need you to make a death saving throw,

1616
02:20:24,730 --> 02:20:26,530
please. Roll a d20.

1617
02:20:26,530 --> 02:20:29,468
LIAM and MARISHA: Come on, Sprigg!

1618
02:20:29,468 --> 02:20:30,999
DARIN: 14.

1619
02:20:30,999 --> 02:20:34,706
MATT: Okay, so you're okay for now. You're
stabilizing. You're not bleeding out, yet. Mark a

1620
02:20:34,706 --> 02:20:37,584
success on your death saving throws there.
Scanlan, what are you doing?

1621
02:20:37,584 --> 02:20:42,743
SAM: I am going to, bonus action-- down here,
success, one.

1622
02:20:42,743 --> 02:20:45,498
MATT: Actually, before he even does that, what are
you doing on your turn?

1623
02:20:45,498 --> 02:20:47,258
SAM: I'm going to heal him first.

1624
02:20:47,258 --> 02:20:51,000
MATT: That roll wouldn't matter because he may heal
you before you come up. Don't worry about it.

1625
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,690
SAM: I'll bonus action Healing Word him,
2nd-level. I will sing to him. I'll do a little

1626
02:20:56,690 --> 02:21:03,761
line dance right in front of him and I'll say:
(singing) I'll heal your heart, your achy breaky

1627
02:21:03,761 --> 02:21:13,190
heart. I just don't think you'll understand. That
if I heal your heart, your achy breaky heart, you

1628
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:16,109
got to wake up and kill a man!

1629
02:21:16,109 --> 02:21:18,664
ALL: Ooh!

1630
02:21:18,664 --> 02:21:21,491
DARIN: (singing) If only you had used Mage Hand!

1631
02:21:21,491 --> 02:21:23,513
SAM: Nice!

1632
02:21:23,513 --> 02:21:26,199
MATT: So how much does he heal?

1633
02:21:26,199 --> 02:21:30,507
SAM: Seven plus six. 13.

1634
02:21:30,507 --> 02:21:34,565
MATT: You heal 13 hit points. That roll doesn't
matter. You hear this echoing song in the back of

1635
02:21:34,565 --> 02:21:40,175
your head. The second song today you've heard from
your childhood. You come to consciousness. You

1636
02:21:40,175 --> 02:21:45,378
wake up and look around you and you can see him
singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic

1637
02:21:45,378 --> 02:21:50,330
creature is looming right in front of you. You
have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an

1638
02:21:50,330 --> 02:21:55,723
old sensation you haven't felt in a long time
courses through your body, which is the need to

1639
02:21:55,723 --> 02:21:57,206
survive.

1640
02:21:57,206 --> 02:21:59,296
SAM: It's my turn still.

1641
02:21:59,296 --> 02:22:01,166
MATT: It's both of your turns at the same time.

1642
02:22:01,166 --> 02:22:03,861
SAM: I will hold my turn.

1643
02:22:03,861 --> 02:22:05,796
MATT: What are you going to do?

1644
02:22:05,796 --> 02:22:13,798
SAM: Dimension Door, but I'm holding until either
Pike or Keyleth heals him more. And I will also

1645
02:22:13,798 --> 02:22:17,465
say to him, old man, do you have some fight left
in you?

1646
02:22:17,465 --> 02:22:19,580
DARIN: I hope so.

1647
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:22,178
SAM: Hold that thought for one second.

1648
02:22:22,178 --> 02:22:23,540
DARIN: Holding.

1649
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:25,105
MATT: So what are you doing?

1650
02:22:25,105 --> 02:22:27,834
DARIN: There's a bookcase, is there not?

1651
02:22:27,834 --> 02:22:31,184
MATT: There's bookcases here, bookcase there.
There's books strewn and clustered in these

1652
02:22:31,184 --> 02:22:32,173
corners.

1653
02:22:32,173 --> 02:22:35,653
DARIN: I'd like to, if I could, use the Ring of
Telekinesis to pull a bookcase down upon an

1654
02:22:35,653 --> 02:22:36,763
attacker.

1655
02:22:36,763 --> 02:22:42,056
MATT: Okay. Currently there's a bunch of books up
here on a shelf, you can pull them down on him if

1656
02:22:42,056 --> 02:22:43,027
you'd like.

1657
02:22:43,027 --> 02:22:44,398
DARIN: I would like to do that.

1658
02:22:44,398 --> 02:22:48,296
MATT: So from the ground, you yank a bunch of
heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes

1659
02:22:48,296 --> 02:22:52,596
flying towards this creature. I'm going to make
this a dexterity saving throw for it.

1660
02:22:52,596 --> 02:22:56,910
MARISHA: The pen is mightier than the bookcase
security!

1661
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:59,953
MATT: What's the DC on the telekinesis ring?

1662
02:22:59,953 --> 02:23:03,493
DARIN: Where was it? Ring of Telekinesis.

1663
02:23:03,493 --> 02:23:11,727
MATT: I'll pull it up here real fast. Looking up
magical items really fast. I have it here. Oh,

1664
02:23:11,727 --> 02:23:14,750
it's for the spell Telekinesis? That's right.
What's your spell DC?

1665
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:18,355
DARIN: 17.

1666
02:23:18,355 --> 02:23:22,973
MATT: 17. No, that's a failure. So for this, go
ahead and roll 3d6.

1667
02:23:22,973 --> 02:23:25,233
SAM: He failed, or the guy failed?

1668
02:23:25,233 --> 02:23:28,703
MATT: The guy failed. He didn't dodge out of the
way. He's like, (confused snarling, book impacts)

1669
02:23:28,703 --> 02:23:33,121
and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes,
books, and random glass baubles that were on the

1670
02:23:33,121 --> 02:23:35,408
shelf that shatter against the back of its head.

1671
02:23:35,408 --> 02:23:39,323
DARIN: We have a six, we have a five, and we have
a two. 13.

1672
02:23:39,323 --> 02:23:41,117
MATT: Then add your intelligence modifier.

1673
02:23:41,117 --> 02:23:43,270
DARIN: My intelligence modifier is a four.

1674
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:51,486
MATT: 17, nice! 17 points of damage to that one.
As you slam it in the back of the head (impacts)

1675
02:23:51,486 --> 02:24:00,524
and it doubles over and (snarling), its long
tongue slashing around. You're still on the ground,

1676
02:24:00,524 --> 02:24:03,340
and it's over you. Is there anything else you want
to do on your turn?

1677
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:04,743
DARIN: Demistrik?!

1678
02:24:04,743 --> 02:24:06,529
MATT: You hear nothing.

1679
02:24:06,529 --> 02:24:09,607
TALIESIN: Not cool.

1680
02:24:09,607 --> 02:24:12,301
DARIN: Can I cast something?

1681
02:24:12,301 --> 02:24:17,076
MATT: That is an action to do that, so if you have
a bonus action spell, you could do that.

1682
02:24:17,076 --> 02:24:19,798
DARIN: I believe I do. Tasha's Hideous Laughter?

1683
02:24:19,798 --> 02:24:22,479
MATT: I believe that's an action to cast,
unfortunately.

1684
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:29,174
DARIN: I don't think we have any bonus actions.
Oh, are there any healing potions that I can use

1685
02:24:29,174 --> 02:24:32,382
my Telekinesis to get a healing potion to me?

1686
02:24:32,529 --> 02:24:38,925
MATT: You can do that next round. The attack was
your one action. You can stand on your feet, if

1687
02:24:38,925 --> 02:24:39,987
you'd like to.

1688
02:24:39,987 --> 02:24:42,434
DARIN: No, I'm gonna stay right here.

1689
02:24:42,484 --> 02:24:46,298
MATT: Got it. That ends your turn. Now, these guys
go again.

1690
02:24:46,298 --> 02:24:52,052
LAURA: That's good, they're at disadvantage, now,
to hit you. They are! Because you're prone.

1691
02:24:52,052 --> 02:24:59,227
MATT: This guy's going to move in. This guy is
still standing and is going to drop the crossbow

1692
02:24:59,227 --> 02:25:07,887
and pull out his shortsword. Is going to go ahead
and attack you, Grog, first. That is 13?

1693
02:25:07,887 --> 02:25:09,413
TRAVIS: Misses.

1694
02:25:09,413 --> 02:25:11,833
MATT: And a 27.

1695
02:25:11,833 --> 02:25:13,473
TRAVIS: That does hit.

1696
02:25:13,473 --> 02:25:22,601
MATT: You take five plus four, that's nine points
of slashing damage, reduced to five, yeah. Round

1697
02:25:22,601 --> 02:25:35,306
down, so it's four. Struck twice, missed both. Both of
these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's

1698
02:25:35,306 --> 02:25:42,668
going to fire at Sprigg on this end because it's
their goal, here. With disadvantage, that is a 16?

1699
02:25:42,668 --> 02:25:44,060
What's your AC again?

1700
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:45,528
DARIN: My AC is 19.

1701
02:25:45,528 --> 02:25:50,639
MATT: 19, yeah. It darts over you. It misses, it
hits the side of the wall. The other guy's going

1702
02:25:50,639 --> 02:25:59,046
to strike again with disadvantage. That's a 14.
And you see the other guy pulling back with a

1703
02:25:59,046 --> 02:26:03,182
crossbow and fire. You roll out of the way and it
(arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right

1704
02:26:03,228 --> 02:26:04,399
next to you.

1705
02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:07,018
DARIN: Are there any traps that they hit?

1706
02:26:07,018 --> 02:26:16,764
MATT: No. That one is going to attack you, Vax,
because you're right there in front of it. That's

1707
02:26:16,764 --> 02:26:23,914
going to be a 13. Does not hit. Second strike,
another 13. Both of its shortsword attacks, you

1708
02:26:23,914 --> 02:26:33,479
duck out of the way and dodge, moving around very
quickly. All righty. Those two right there, one of

1709
02:26:33,479 --> 02:26:37,868
them is going to, because it saw that you got up,
Scanlan, they're going to fire two bolts directly

1710
02:26:37,868 --> 02:26:42,222
at you. That is a 16 to hit?

1711
02:26:42,222 --> 02:26:43,606
SAM: That hits.

1712
02:26:43,606 --> 02:26:46,024
MATT: Okay, and the second one is a 24.

1713
02:26:46,024 --> 02:26:47,355
SAM: Everything hits.

1714
02:26:47,355 --> 02:26:53,407
MATT: You are currently in base-to-base with one
of their companions, so they both get sneak attack

1715
02:26:53,407 --> 02:27:12,901
on you. 19 points of piercing damage from the
first hit. 24 points of piercing damage from the

1716
02:27:12,901 --> 02:27:18,381
second hit. And then they both duck around the
side here.

1717
02:27:18,381 --> 02:27:22,612
SAM: What was the second one? 24.

1718
02:27:22,612 --> 02:27:27,378
MATT: They both, we'll say, they vanish from
sight. You're not quite sure where they are right

1719
02:27:27,378 --> 02:27:37,381
now. Those two also duck out of sight, not quite
sure where they are, either. That ends their go.

1720
02:27:37,381 --> 02:27:43,956
Now, the guy in the back right there, who noticed
Vax show up, is going to, after you slaughter one

1721
02:27:43,956 --> 02:27:51,094
of the guys, and stab the other one, is going to
angrily go ahead and use Blight on you. Can you

1722
02:27:51,094 --> 02:27:55,891
go ahead an make a constitution saving throw,
please?

1723
02:27:55,891 --> 02:28:01,554
LIAM: Natural 20. You fucking dick, necro guy!

1724
02:28:01,554 --> 02:28:05,188
MATT: All righty. That does half the damage.

1725
02:28:05,188 --> 02:28:11,066
LIAM: It's still a lot.

1726
02:28:11,066 --> 02:28:13,372
TALIESIN: I feel like a natural 20 should
auto-fail this.

1727
02:28:13,372 --> 02:28:15,388
LAURA: I know, right?

1728
02:28:15,388 --> 02:28:18,930
MATT: 21 points of necrotic damage to you.

1729
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:20,420
LIAM: All righty.

1730
02:28:20,420 --> 02:28:31,603
MATT: And is going to-- four, five, six. All
righty. That ends his turn. Vex, you're up.

1731
02:28:31,603 --> 02:28:37,769
LAURA: I'm going to run over to the window that
those guys disappeared from.

1732
02:28:37,769 --> 02:28:39,866
MATT: Over this way or this way?

1733
02:28:39,866 --> 02:28:45,959
LAURA: Right there, yeah. Can I see that
motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window?

1734
02:28:45,959 --> 02:28:49,649
MATT: You know what? Yes, because he was not
stealthing. You watch as he darts by, and you

1735
02:28:49,649 --> 02:28:51,135
would have a shot, yeah.

1736
02:28:51,135 --> 02:28:54,985
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to shoot at him.
I'm going to Hunter's Mark him!

1737
02:28:54,985 --> 02:28:57,320
MATT: All righty, look at that!

1738
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:03,419
LAURA: Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get
over by him, does he?

1739
02:29:03,419 --> 02:29:06,968
MATT: No, but Trinket can attack whatever's in
your area, too.

1740
02:29:06,968 --> 02:29:21,310
LAURA: I'm going to attack him with my Bramble
Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah.

1741
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:22,695
That's a 31.

1742
02:29:22,695 --> 02:29:25,055
MATT: 31? That hits!

1743
02:29:25,055 --> 02:29:30,304
LAURA: Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I
don't, do I?

1744
02:29:30,304 --> 02:29:31,842
MATT: No.

1745
02:29:31,842 --> 02:29:35,885
LAURA: Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay.

1746
02:29:35,885 --> 02:29:43,338
LIAM: Hey Matt, I realized. I never shot out the
wings, so I shouldn't have had as much movement as

1747
02:29:43,338 --> 02:29:46,761
I did, so I think we should take the damage back
from my last attack.

1748
02:29:46,761 --> 02:29:56,335
MATT: (counting). 50 to get up to the top there,
so at your double speed, you'd be at 60, threw the

1749
02:29:56,335 --> 02:29:59,121
dagger and threw the dagger. You're fine. It still
works out.

1750
02:29:59,121 --> 02:30:08,250
LAURA: Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage.
That's balls.

1751
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:10,320
MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth, just so you know.

1752
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:16,238
LAURA: Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of
damage.

1753
02:30:16,238 --> 02:30:21,092
MATT: The first arrow hits him in the stomach,
doubles forward and pulls back. Now, glancing

1754
02:30:21,092 --> 02:30:25,147
over, saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time
and now is going to try and back up as you're

1755
02:30:25,147 --> 02:30:26,490
taking the second shot.

1756
02:30:26,490 --> 02:30:29,869
LAURA: Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength
save?

1757
02:30:29,869 --> 02:30:39,026
MATT: Rolls a natural 17. Literally. Strength
save? Minus one strength modifier.

1758
02:30:39,026 --> 02:30:43,317
(cheering)

1759
02:30:43,317 --> 02:30:51,633
MATT: Oh, silly necromancer. You and your
strength of nine. All right, so he is currently

1760
02:30:51,633 --> 02:31:00,748
entangled in the brambles as the vines wrap
around and pull him in, almost near the tree. You

1761
02:31:00,748 --> 02:31:03,248
see the staff is pulled close to his chest.

1762
02:31:03,248 --> 02:31:07,795
LAURA: Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh,
wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage.

1763
02:31:07,795 --> 02:31:16,825
Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm
going to shoot him again. I'm just asking: do you

1764
02:31:16,825 --> 02:31:19,111
get sneak attack damage if they're restrained?

1765
02:31:19,111 --> 02:31:26,318
MATT: You do, yeah. You can do that. You have
advantage on the attack, remember, because he's

1766
02:31:26,318 --> 02:31:27,604
restrained.

1767
02:31:27,604 --> 02:31:33,385
LAURA: That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32?

1768
02:31:33,385 --> 02:31:34,940
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1769
02:31:34,940 --> 02:31:54,515
LAURA: Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak
attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then

1770
02:31:54,515 --> 02:31:59,068
Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24.

1771
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:05,554
MATT: 24. Nice. The second arrow hits right in the
throat, and you can see it doesn't hit anything

1772
02:32:05,554 --> 02:32:10,076
vital, but you can see blood's starting to pour
out. It's one of those things that if he were to

1773
02:32:10,076 --> 02:32:12,931
pull it out, it would probably be very bad. But
he's leaving it in right now. He's looking pretty

1774
02:32:12,931 --> 02:32:13,925
rough.

1775
02:32:13,925 --> 02:32:15,054
TRAVIS: The necromancer is?

1776
02:32:15,054 --> 02:32:18,477
MATT: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn?
Keyleth, your turn.

1777
02:32:18,477 --> 02:32:20,158
LAURA: I'm going to step away from the window.

1778
02:32:20,158 --> 02:32:21,604
MATT: Okay. Step away from the window.

1779
02:32:21,604 --> 02:32:23,370
LAURA: No, against the wall.

1780
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:27,257
MATT: Against the wall there? You push the table
back a bit; book almost falls off the top. What's

1781
02:32:27,257 --> 02:32:28,585
Trinket doing?

1782
02:32:28,585 --> 02:32:35,224
LAURA: Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and
Scanlan.

1783
02:32:35,224 --> 02:32:38,433
MATT: Up to Scanlan, or the guy who's there?

1784
02:32:38,433 --> 02:32:39,912
LAURA: Just to the guy.

1785
02:32:39,912 --> 02:32:41,063
MATT: Okay.

1786
02:32:41,063 --> 02:32:44,795
LAURA: Just try to growl at him and scare him
because he can't attack him.

1787
02:32:44,795 --> 02:32:48,637
TALIESIN: He's technically now engaged with the
bear, so if he walks away, the bear gets an attack

1788
02:32:48,637 --> 02:32:49,562
of opportunity.

1789
02:32:49,562 --> 02:32:54,340
MATT: That's true. That ends your turn. Trinket
goes (roars) right in front of the creature.

1790
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:55,634
Keyleth, what are you doing?

1791
02:32:55,634 --> 02:33:01,638
MARISHA: Okay. In my weird, emotional panic,
Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she

1792
02:33:01,638 --> 02:33:07,580
sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the
floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to

1793
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:16,148
scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm
around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm

1794
02:33:16,148 --> 02:33:20,728
going to go (boof) where I think people might be
in my rage.

1795
02:33:20,728 --> 02:33:25,587
MATT: Okay! So around the building where?

1796
02:33:25,587 --> 02:33:31,420
MARISHA: Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't
really know you're there, but around here and around

1797
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:39,708
here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things,
right? I'm going to try and go around.

1798
02:33:39,708 --> 02:33:41,468
MATT: So you have right here.

1799
02:33:41,468 --> 02:33:43,982
MARISHA: Here, around, and that way.

1800
02:33:43,982 --> 02:33:48,958
MATT: All right. Okay, because you didn't see Vax
outside.

1801
02:33:48,958 --> 02:33:51,235
MARISHA: No. He's getting hit.

1802
02:33:51,235 --> 02:33:52,847
MATT: You saw Vax run upstairs.

1803
02:33:52,847 --> 02:33:58,549
MARISHA: I just know there were people shooting through
this window and through this window, so I'm doing

1804
02:33:58,549 --> 02:34:01,233
a perimeter around.

1805
02:34:01,335 --> 02:34:06,261
MATT: How many squares is it? Ten,
right?

1806
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:10,607
MARISHA: Ten ten-by-tens.

1807
02:34:10,607 --> 02:34:15,672
MATT: These two here get caught in it, as well as
Vax and that guy there.

1808
02:34:15,672 --> 02:34:17,568
LAURA: What about the magician guy?

1809
02:34:17,568 --> 02:34:20,264
MATT: If she's doing a perimeter? No.

1810
02:34:20,264 --> 02:34:22,451
LAURA: Did you know that I was shooting at somebody?

1811
02:34:22,451 --> 02:34:29,024
MATT: She doesn't see the magician. Doesn't know
where it is. "The Magician." The Prestige!

1812
02:34:29,024 --> 02:34:31,439
LIAM: I have evasion.

1813
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:33,168
MATT: Which means it's either half or nothing.

1814
02:34:33,168 --> 02:34:36,457
LIAM: Right. At advantage because of the boots.
What do I have to match?

1815
02:34:36,457 --> 02:34:38,977
MATT: Her DC, which is 21, right?

1816
02:34:38,977 --> 02:34:40,381
MARISHA: 21.

1817
02:34:40,381 --> 02:34:42,759
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

1818
02:34:42,759 --> 02:34:45,202
LIAM: Oh yeah, way higher than that. We're good.

1819
02:34:45,202 --> 02:34:48,474
MATT: Yeah, you take no damage. You duck out of
the Fire Storm just in time for it to

1820
02:34:48,474 --> 02:34:50,081
(raging fire).

1821
02:34:50,081 --> 02:34:52,033
MARISHA: I need two more d10s.

1822
02:34:52,033 --> 02:34:54,716
LIAM: Yeah, dexterity save, man. Area effect.

1823
02:34:54,716 --> 02:35:02,475
TALIESIN: Smoky d10 and spiky d10. And you get
rerolls!

1824
02:35:02,475 --> 02:35:18,992
MARISHA: I reroll ones. None of these are ones,
unfortunately. (counting)

1825
02:35:18,992 --> 02:35:21,897
DARIN: I just noticed the little lanterns glowing.
Bravo!

1826
02:35:22,043 --> 02:35:25,360
MATT: Oh! Bravo to Dwarven Forge, man.

1827
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:27,747
SAM: Well, it's your house.

1828
02:35:27,747 --> 02:35:30,213
MATT: True. Good torches you have in there.

1829
02:35:30,213 --> 02:35:34,703
TRAVIS: Way to be energy-conscious with those
LEDs!

1830
02:35:34,703 --> 02:35:40,583
MARISHA: 39 fire damage.

1831
02:35:40,583 --> 02:35:49,327
MATT: 39 damage. This guy incinerates. He screams
and burns. He manages to dodge partway out, but

1832
02:35:49,327 --> 02:35:54,313
even the partial damage burns him and he
(screams). You see him run off into the forest ten

1833
02:35:54,313 --> 02:35:59,773
or so steps, on fire, like a stun man shot in a
movie before he (impact) on the ground and

1834
02:35:59,773 --> 02:36:04,831
smolders there in the distance. Those guys take
it. What was the amount again?

1835
02:36:04,831 --> 02:36:07,086
MARISHA: 39, and they're on fire.

1836
02:36:07,086 --> 02:36:09,860
TALIESIN: It's hard to stealth when you're on
fire.

1837
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:12,219
MATT: They're both on fire.

1838
02:36:12,219 --> 02:36:19,471
MARISHA: So that was my action. I'm going to do
that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going

1839
02:36:19,471 --> 02:36:28,977
to look at Sprigg and say: gods damn it, Sprigg!
And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and

1840
02:36:28,977 --> 02:36:54,327
I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which
is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to

1841
02:36:54,327 --> 02:36:59,027
use my free action that I have to turn into a fire
elemental.

1842
02:36:59,027 --> 02:37:01,529
MATT: Your free action?

1843
02:37:01,529 --> 02:37:08,359
MARISHA: Changing into something's not a bonus,
it's a free action to change into my beast shape.

1844
02:37:08,359 --> 02:37:10,754
Circle of the Moon, bitch!

1845
02:37:10,754 --> 02:37:13,057
SAM: Did you just call your fiancé--

1846
02:37:13,057 --> 02:37:14,687
TRAVIS: -- a bitch?

1847
02:37:14,687 --> 02:37:20,154
MARISHA: No! Combat wild shape.

1848
02:37:20,154 --> 02:37:25,315
MATT: Combat Wild Shape makes it a bonus action, as
opposed to an action. That's the difference.

1849
02:37:25,353 --> 02:37:31,587
LIAM: I would like to retract my "bitch," please.

1850
02:37:31,587 --> 02:37:37,742
MARISHA: All right, so I'm just Keyleth.

1851
02:37:37,742 --> 02:37:47,130
MATT: Does that end your turn? All right, so as
Keyleth's turn ends, it comes to Pike's. The

1852
02:37:47,130 --> 02:37:52,069
entire exterior perimeter of this part of the
house is on fire. Flames are now starting to

1853
02:37:52,069 --> 02:37:57,254
catch. It is dry wood; the entire building is made
from wood of the forest, so your home is now in

1854
02:37:57,254 --> 02:37:58,379
flames.

1855
02:37:58,379 --> 02:38:06,880
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the
perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I

1856
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:09,745
didn't attack the guy in the house.

1857
02:38:09,745 --> 02:38:14,618
TRAVIS: If you napalm the forest, the trees will
probably catch fire.

1858
02:38:14,618 --> 02:38:16,807
LIAM: It's a quick jump, though.

1859
02:38:16,807 --> 02:38:23,684
MATT: In order to do the perimeter, it's not a
blazing inferno, but it's starting to catch.

1860
02:38:23,684 --> 02:38:26,456
Flames are starting to lick up the sides.

1861
02:38:26,456 --> 02:38:28,581
LIAM: End it quick, we can save it.

1862
02:38:28,581 --> 02:38:31,374
MATT: Fire Storm's a dangerous spell.

1863
02:38:31,374 --> 02:38:34,544
LAURA: Let's try to save those books before they
all burn.

1864
02:38:34,544 --> 02:38:38,476
SAM: He's an old guy. We were either going to kill
him or burn his house down.

1865
02:38:38,476 --> 02:38:41,399
MATT: It's Vox Machina's MO, man!

1866
02:38:41,399 --> 02:38:44,461
SAM: It was always going to end this way.

1867
02:38:44,461 --> 02:38:48,973
TALIESIN: Things you own end up owning you.

1868
02:38:48,973 --> 02:38:52,842
DARIN: So glad I wore a jacket.

1869
02:38:52,842 --> 02:39:00,064
MATT: Pike is going to rush forward and is also
going to attempt to Healing Word you at level two.

1870
02:39:00,064 --> 02:39:06,549
It's a heal fountain on you. That is six plus
five. That's 11 hit points you heal.

1871
02:39:06,549 --> 02:39:11,327
SAM: As soon as she does that, I grab him and we
Dimension Door out the house.

1872
02:39:11,327 --> 02:39:12,962
MATT: Where do you Dimension Door?

1873
02:39:12,962 --> 02:39:19,392
SAM: To the only place I know: front of the house.
Outside the front door. Not right outside, but

1874
02:39:19,392 --> 02:39:23,713
towards the edge of the map there.

1875
02:39:23,713 --> 02:39:25,096
MATT: Over here?

1876
02:39:25,096 --> 02:39:28,453
SAM: Yeah, anywhere around there, on approach to
the house.

1877
02:39:28,453 --> 02:39:31,020
TRAVIS: Or do you want to be more over yonder?

1878
02:39:31,020 --> 02:39:33,134
SAM: Where's the front door to the house?

1879
02:39:33,134 --> 02:39:34,455
MARISHA: Right there.

1880
02:39:34,455 --> 02:39:40,955
SAM: So I'd be 20 feet, the way we approached to
the house. So where you got it, if that's the way

1881
02:39:40,955 --> 02:39:42,161
we approached.

1882
02:39:42,161 --> 02:39:46,932
MATT: You guys approached this direction. So
you're there. Make a perception check, Scanlan.

1883
02:39:46,932 --> 02:39:50,201
SAM: Okay. Ten.

1884
02:39:50,201 --> 02:39:57,191
MATT: Okay. You don't see the two hidden fellows
over here. You see something large and hulking

1885
02:39:57,191 --> 02:40:01,268
moving through the forest this direction, at a quick
glance.

1886
02:40:01,268 --> 02:40:02,668
SAM: Is it naked?

1887
02:40:02,668 --> 02:40:03,978
MATT: No.

1888
02:40:03,978 --> 02:40:06,450
TALIESIN: Then we're going to be okay.

1889
02:40:06,450 --> 02:40:11,196
MATT: You guys have pulled out of that house.
You're still on the ground and all of a sudden

1890
02:40:11,196 --> 02:40:16,199
your body physically shifts, and you're looking up at
the trees. You glance around and you can see the

1891
02:40:16,199 --> 02:40:22,518
back of your house, you can hear the frantic fray
going on. You see the necromancer who's currently

1892
02:40:22,518 --> 02:40:26,727
covered in brambles and held in place. You see a
couple of guys on fire, on the side screaming on

1893
02:40:26,727 --> 02:40:32,445
the side of the house, and your house starting to
catch fire. That's okay. Pike, on her turn, is

1894
02:40:32,445 --> 02:40:35,136
going to--

1895
02:40:35,136 --> 02:40:39,752
MARISHA: Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine.

1896
02:40:39,752 --> 02:40:42,991
MATT: Because it's a single target...

1897
02:40:42,991 --> 02:40:48,504
SAM: It's the "This is fine" meme, except it's
just Keyleth.

1898
02:40:48,504 --> 02:40:54,659
MATT: She's going to cast a level five Guiding Bolt
because that's what Pike does. So ranged spell

1899
02:40:54,659 --> 02:41:04,869
attack against that guy. 11 plus-- yeah, that
hits. That's a 21. So that is 8d6 radiant damage.

1900
02:41:04,869 --> 02:41:11,199
Nice. 19.

1901
02:41:11,199 --> 02:41:15,028
LAURA: Is she doing it to the magician?

1902
02:41:15,028 --> 02:41:16,899
MATT: No, this guy right there, in the room.

1903
02:41:16,899 --> 02:41:19,333
SAM: He's an illusionist, Laura.

1904
02:41:19,333 --> 02:41:24,526
TRAVIS: Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is
David Blaine with them?

1905
02:41:24,526 --> 02:41:31,513
MATT: So after she heals Sprigg, and Sprigg
vanishes, she grabs her holy symbol and goes,

1906
02:41:31,513 --> 02:41:36,694
"Chill out!" and shoots this giant flashing beam
of divine energy that slams into it. You watch as

1907
02:41:36,694 --> 02:41:42,334
a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact.
It's still standing, but it's a shining beacon.

1908
02:41:42,334 --> 02:41:50,766
The next attack against it has advantage. And then
Pike's going to back up with you, Vex, towards the

1909
02:41:50,766 --> 02:42:03,890
back where the bookcase is and goes, "You smell
something?" You now hear, simultaneously,

1910
02:42:03,890 --> 02:42:14,086
(slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back
wall explode inward, as splinters of wood and

1911
02:42:14,086 --> 02:42:18,255
stone (crashing) comes from this wall here--

1912
02:42:18,255 --> 02:42:20,222
LAURA: Oh no, all of his stuff!

1913
02:42:20,222 --> 02:42:22,645
MARISHA: So I didn't destroy your house <i>first</i>.

1914
02:42:22,645 --> 02:42:24,717
LIAM: Flames! Flames, less of a thing.

1915
02:42:24,717 --> 02:42:26,409
TALIESIN: On the side of the house.

1916
02:42:26,409 --> 02:42:29,733
LIAM: Flames on the side of the house!

1917
02:42:29,733 --> 02:42:42,065
MATT: Two familiar hulking entities come
barrelling into the chamber. Remember those giant

1918
02:42:42,065 --> 02:42:46,088
things you saw walking through the Shadowfell that
you barely avoided with the mask?

1919
02:42:46,088 --> 02:42:47,999
MARISHA: The censer?

1920
02:42:47,999 --> 02:42:54,997
MATT: Who has the censer? Not on you right now.
You don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer

1921
02:42:54,997 --> 02:42:56,019
with you!

1922
02:42:56,019 --> 02:42:58,334
LAURA: Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that
big.

1923
02:42:58,334 --> 02:43:00,605
TALIESIN: I think at that point, I think we put it
in the Bag of Holding.

1924
02:43:00,605 --> 02:43:03,323
SAM: But you did make a bunch of those herbs.

1925
02:43:03,323 --> 02:43:05,242
MARISHA: I do have the herbs.

1926
02:43:05,242 --> 02:43:07,986
SAM: And there's a shit-ton of shit on fire right
now.

1927
02:43:07,986 --> 02:43:15,986
MATT: They burst through. (roaring) This big yell
echoes through their metal masks. It sounds like

1928
02:43:15,986 --> 02:43:22,130
this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's
peaking on the audio level against a tinny

1929
02:43:22,130 --> 02:43:23,556
metallic speaker.

1930
02:43:23,556 --> 02:43:28,737
LIAM: (Bane voice) Your punishment will be more
severe!

1931
02:43:28,737 --> 02:43:32,829
MATT: Essentially. This one's going to go after
Keyleth. This one's going to make two swipes at

1932
02:43:32,829 --> 02:43:40,926
Trinket because Trinket's right there. As they
barrel through, part of the roof breaks. Guys up

1933
02:43:40,926 --> 02:43:48,554
top, Percy and Grog, you feel the ground buckle a
little bit below you and you drop about two or

1934
02:43:48,554 --> 02:43:53,435
three inches as the building is starting to lose
its physical frame.

1935
02:43:53,435 --> 02:43:56,855
TALIESIN: Oh god, Grog, what did Keyleth do?

1936
02:43:56,855 --> 02:43:59,793
TRAVIS: Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one
second!

1937
02:43:59,793 --> 02:44:04,976
TALIESIN: I'm well aware. It was totally worth
it.

1938
02:44:04,976 --> 02:44:10,290
MARISHA: #thanksKeyleth.

1939
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:14,182
MATT: That's one's going to go ahead and do two
slam attacks against Keyleth.

1940
02:44:14,182 --> 02:44:17,371
MARISHA: Yeah, I've earned it. Come on!

1941
02:44:17,371 --> 02:44:19,168
MATT: That's 23 to hit.

1942
02:44:19,168 --> 02:44:20,560
MARISHA: Yeah, that hits.

1943
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:25,213
MATT: And that's a 29 to hit.

1944
02:44:25,213 --> 02:44:27,308
MARISHA: Yeah.

1945
02:44:27,308 --> 02:44:44,908
MATT: That's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from
the first hit. And the second one is 30 points of

1946
02:44:44,908 --> 02:44:49,692
bludgeoning damage. (two slams) And it slams you.
The second fist actually pins you up against the

1947
02:44:49,692 --> 02:44:56,274
wall there, and you feel ribs crack inside your
chest and now-- they're both down low in this

1948
02:44:56,274 --> 02:45:01,726
hulking mass. They're almost wider than they are
any other dimension with how they're crouched down

1949
02:45:01,726 --> 02:45:06,010
and the thickness of their body. They're taking up
almost the entirety of the room right now.

1950
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:07,994
MARISHA: You said 30 points, right?

1951
02:45:07,994 --> 02:45:09,326
MATT: Yes, for the second one.

1952
02:45:09,326 --> 02:45:10,926
MARISHA: So I'm at 83 points.

1953
02:45:10,926 --> 02:45:18,833
MATT: Correct. The other one's going to slam twice
into Trinket. Giant fists. That's going to be a

1954
02:45:18,833 --> 02:45:19,943
28.

1955
02:45:19,943 --> 02:45:21,068
LAURA: 28 hits.

1956
02:45:21,068 --> 02:45:22,060
MATT: And a 22.

1957
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,712
LAURA: 22 hits.

1958
02:45:23,712 --> 02:45:29,645
MATT: That is five plus six. 11 points of
bludgeoning damage to Trinket.

1959
02:45:29,645 --> 02:45:30,620
LAURA: Halved.

1960
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:37,830
MATT: Halved, correct. And 22 points of
bludgeoning damage, halved.

1961
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:41,999
LAURA: Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points.

1962
02:45:41,999 --> 02:45:45,171
MATT: That ends their go. We're at the top of the
round. Percy, you're upstairs.

1963
02:45:45,171 --> 02:45:55,216
TALIESIN: Okay, this all happened. That's awkward.
That's okay, I know where I am. I'm going to run

1964
02:45:55,216 --> 02:45:57,877
out onto the balcony really quick.

1965
02:45:57,877 --> 02:46:00,310
MARISHA: There's room over here.

1966
02:46:00,310 --> 02:46:01,737
TRAVIS: That guy's still up there with us, right?

1967
02:46:01,737 --> 02:46:06,105
TALIESIN: Yeah. I figure you're going to handle
him. Grog, take care of these two. What do I see

1968
02:46:06,105 --> 02:46:08,501
outside on the balcony?

1969
02:46:08,501 --> 02:46:12,832
MATT: You see, currently down below-- make a
perception check. Actually, you wouldn't even see

1970
02:46:12,832 --> 02:46:14,325
them from your perspective.

1971
02:46:14,325 --> 02:46:16,124
TALIESIN: I just rolled a natural 20.

1972
02:46:16,124 --> 02:46:20,253
MATT: Right, it's blocking your vision from this
side. You do see Scanlan, you see Sprigg who is

1973
02:46:20,253 --> 02:46:24,939
currently conscious, you see this necromancer who
is currently held with brambles, and you see two

1974
02:46:24,939 --> 02:46:27,982
streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the
building.

1975
02:46:27,982 --> 02:46:32,596
TALIESIN: Weird question, really quickly. Where is
that giant log trap?

1976
02:46:32,596 --> 02:46:34,802
MATT: Right there.

1977
02:46:34,802 --> 02:46:43,097
TALIESIN: How much swing does it have? Is it
locked all the way over here, or is it hung back

1978
02:46:43,097 --> 02:46:44,079
there?

1979
02:46:44,079 --> 02:46:45,583
MATT: It looks more like a drop.

1980
02:46:45,583 --> 02:46:50,497
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's a drop on the door. Good to
know. In the meantime, I'm going to run on the

1981
02:46:50,497 --> 02:46:57,567
exterior of the wall, like right over here, if
that makes sense. That's going to be my movement.

1982
02:46:57,567 --> 02:47:01,598
I'm going to take some fun, happy pot shots at
these bastards.

1983
02:47:01,598 --> 02:47:04,756
LAURA: At the necromancer?

1984
02:47:04,756 --> 02:47:12,514
TALIESIN: At the necromancer! Let's start with
that bound necromancer. He's fun.

1985
02:47:12,514 --> 02:47:14,054
LIAM: With the Vecna eye.

1986
02:47:14,054 --> 02:47:16,747
TALIESIN: With the Vecna eye. He's bound, so I
have advantage to hit him?

1987
02:47:16,747 --> 02:47:18,305
MATT: Yes, you do.

1988
02:47:18,305 --> 02:47:21,845
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to use my Animus
gun so I still have a hand open, and I'm also

1989
02:47:21,845 --> 02:47:31,316
going to burn a point of grit so that I can get
him to drop his staff. Here we go with advantage.

1990
02:47:31,316 --> 02:47:36,713
Oh darn, it was so close. 28.

1991
02:47:36,713 --> 02:47:38,105
MATT: That hits.

1992
02:47:38,105 --> 02:47:52,204
TALIESIN: That's-- ooh! Fancy. 18 points of
damage, four points of psychic damage, and he has

1993
02:47:52,204 --> 02:47:57,465
to make a strength saving throw or drops his
items.

1994
02:47:57,465 --> 02:48:02,087
MATT: Oh, don't worry, he drops the staff, because
there's not much left of his head. When you hit

1995
02:48:02,087 --> 02:48:06,756
the arm, the staff's clutching, but you slam it
and it hits the side of the head and causes the

1996
02:48:06,756 --> 02:48:11,781
right side of the face to explode against the
tree, the brambles still clutching as it falls

1997
02:48:11,781 --> 02:48:15,758
limp to the ground, and they crush the body into a
small rock of flesh.

1998
02:48:15,758 --> 02:48:17,157
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1999
02:48:17,157 --> 02:48:20,443
MARISHA: You get a grit point back, right?

2000
02:48:20,443 --> 02:48:23,946
LAURA: You get a grit point back, you get a grit
point back!

2001
02:48:23,946 --> 02:48:27,740
MATT: You just barely see them; they have
three-quarters cover. But you have sharpshooter.

2002
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:32,540
TALIESIN: Three-quarters cover, what does that
mean in this crazy world? I'm going to burn a grit

2003
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:34,829
for advantage and shoot one of them.

2004
02:48:34,829 --> 02:48:38,887
MATT: The one right furthest on the side there?

2005
02:48:38,887 --> 02:48:46,069
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'll start there. Let's give it a
shot. I love advantage; it's so wonderful. 32. I

2006
02:48:46,069 --> 02:48:53,959
really should have done extra damage. So that's
1d10 plus six. That hits, obviously. 32 to hit?

2007
02:48:53,959 --> 02:49:00,198
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Goodbye, necromancer.

2008
02:49:00,198 --> 02:49:02,821
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage plus two points of
psychic damage.

2009
02:49:02,821 --> 02:49:04,437
MATT: How much was that, sorry?

2010
02:49:04,437 --> 02:49:06,508
TALIESIN: 17 points of damage plus two points of
psychic damage.

2011
02:49:06,508 --> 02:49:13,318
MATT: Okay. All right, he's still standing.
(bullet impact, yelps) He starts looking up to see

2012
02:49:13,359 --> 02:49:18,893
where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound
through the torso and out the back of the shoulder

2013
02:49:18,893 --> 02:49:23,499
was clean through. You hear him breathing, gasping
for breath. (gasping)

2014
02:49:23,499 --> 02:49:26,519
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at him.
I'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot, and

2015
02:49:26,519 --> 02:49:41,440
again with advantage because that's fun. Here we
go. Damn! Almost a crit. That's 29. That hits.

2016
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:43,945
MATT: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

2017
02:49:43,945 --> 02:49:53,666
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage-- I'm sorry, 24
points of damage plus two points of psychic

2018
02:49:53,666 --> 02:49:54,812
damage.

2019
02:49:54,812 --> 02:49:58,892
MATT: He falls to the ground, face first. The
second shot hits him in the chest. He just goes

2020
02:49:58,892 --> 02:50:01,719
down, crumples. His body begins to smolder.

2021
02:50:01,719 --> 02:50:07,626
TALIESIN: I use my bonus action to reload and
stare at the nice person below me.

2022
02:50:07,626 --> 02:50:14,427
MATT: That ends Percival's turn. Grog, you're up.
You hear, downstairs, the (heavy thudding).

2023
02:50:14,427 --> 02:50:18,342
There's the guy in front of you who's like, (angry
breathing). What are you going to do?

2024
02:50:18,342 --> 02:50:21,896
TRAVIS: Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles
together and cast Enlarge on myself?

2025
02:50:21,896 --> 02:50:27,786
MATT: You can! And your head goes into the roof!
(thudding)

2026
02:50:27,786 --> 02:50:30,205
MARISHA: We're real sorry about your house.

2027
02:50:30,205 --> 02:50:34,000
DARIN: It wasn't a house. It was a prison.

2028
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:38,325
LAURA: Well, then you're welcome.

2029
02:50:38,325 --> 02:50:42,107
TRAVIS: I'm hoping the floor gives.

2030
02:50:42,107 --> 02:50:48,333
MATT: The floor gives out. As your head (crashing)
into the ceiling (creaking, crashing) it falls out

2031
02:50:48,333 --> 02:50:56,968
from under you. You come falling down on top of
this guy. Rubble falls around. Keyleth, I need you

2032
02:50:56,968 --> 02:51:02,557
to make a dexterity saving throw. I need Trinket
to make a dexterity saving throw. The other shadow

2033
02:51:02,557 --> 02:51:04,723
ghast fails.

2034
02:51:04,723 --> 02:51:08,109
MARISHA: Nine.

2035
02:51:08,109 --> 02:51:09,408
LAURA: 14.

2036
02:51:09,408 --> 02:51:18,079
MATT: Trinket, you, and the shadow ghast all take
22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves

2037
02:51:18,079 --> 02:51:23,327
in over on top. Large part of the upper floor now
falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone

2038
02:51:23,327 --> 02:51:27,162
there. He also takes damage. You take 22
points of bludgeoning damage from falling through

2039
02:51:27,162 --> 02:51:29,725
the wreckage. Trinket's is halved, yes.

2040
02:51:29,725 --> 02:51:36,512
MARISHA: Ugh, debris, ugh!

2041
02:51:36,512 --> 02:51:40,444
MATT: That kills him. The shadow ghast right
here.

2042
02:51:40,444 --> 02:51:43,362
TRAVIS: Because he had barely any left.

2043
02:51:43,362 --> 02:51:49,688
MATT: Yeah. He's like, "Huh?" (crashing) Gets
rained on with rubble, broken, splintered wood and

2044
02:51:49,688 --> 02:51:50,646
stone.

2045
02:51:50,646 --> 02:51:52,560
TRAVIS: The guy in Manners, he fell too, right?

2046
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:57,573
MATT: His part of the ceiling didn't fully
collapse. He's just out of the way. He's dangling

2047
02:51:57,573 --> 02:52:04,093
off the edge right now, as he shakes, it's making
its way towards the hole. The whole ceiling didn't

2048
02:52:04,093 --> 02:52:06,016
collapse, just the area right below.

2049
02:52:06,016 --> 02:52:13,091
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my
right and make two reckless attacks against him?

2050
02:52:13,091 --> 02:52:14,911
They're not giants, right?

2051
02:52:14,911 --> 02:52:19,197
MATT: No, they're not giants. They're considered
undead.

2052
02:52:19,197 --> 02:52:27,477
TRAVIS: They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And
the second one.

2053
02:52:27,477 --> 02:52:29,043
MATT: Big targets.

2054
02:52:29,043 --> 02:52:33,048
TRAVIS: 29.

2055
02:52:33,048 --> 02:52:34,606
MATT: Hits.

2056
02:52:34,606 --> 02:52:44,614
TRAVIS: So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25.

2057
02:52:44,614 --> 02:52:47,985
MATT: 25 with the first hit. (whack)

2058
02:52:47,985 --> 02:52:52,142
TRAVIS: 22 with the second one.

2059
02:52:52,142 --> 02:52:57,340
MATT: 22 damage on the second hit. (whacks) You're
hitting him. Laying on its back, it has these

2060
02:52:57,340 --> 02:53:02,967
metal spikes jamming out of its flesh. You can see
portions of other creatures that it had slain that

2061
02:53:02,967 --> 02:53:07,688
have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away
on its armor. So as you're hitting it, you're

2062
02:53:07,688 --> 02:53:11,667
knocking away parts of partially decomposed
creatures that previously fell in battle to one of

2063
02:53:11,667 --> 02:53:16,265
these creatures. As you're slamming into it, you
can see it's just rippling, partially decayed

2064
02:53:16,265 --> 02:53:21,058
muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened
by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched

2065
02:53:21,058 --> 02:53:24,127
together and alive. It's a thick sack of hit
points.

2066
02:53:24,127 --> 02:53:27,087
TRAVIS: Wow. Cool. Good to know.

2067
02:53:27,087 --> 02:53:28,677
MATT: Is that your turn; are you doing anything
else?

2068
02:53:28,677 --> 02:53:36,798
TRAVIS: That's interesting. I'm going to go into a
frenzied rage as my bonus action.

2069
02:53:36,798 --> 02:53:44,198
MATT: Okay, and that's the end of your turn? Okay.
End of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. You heard all

2070
02:53:44,198 --> 02:53:46,736
this go on and now the whole building is starting
to catch fire.

2071
02:53:46,736 --> 02:53:48,485
LIAM: I'm going to bolt to that window.

2072
02:53:48,485 --> 02:53:50,339
MATT: Right there?

2073
02:53:50,339 --> 02:53:54,644
LIAM: No, other way. So I have a view of Keyleth,
the creature, and Grog. I'm going to throw

2074
02:53:54,644 --> 02:53:59,192
Whisper-- I've got sharpshooter-- at that thing,
and bamf there.

2075
02:53:59,192 --> 02:54:02,784
MATT: I will say, at proximity to the flames that
are starting to catch, you do take three

2076
02:54:02,784 --> 02:54:03,905
points of fire damage.

2077
02:54:03,964 --> 02:54:05,075
LIAM: Fine.

2078
02:54:05,075 --> 02:54:08,123
MATT: You threw the dagger at the big guy?

2079
02:54:08,123 --> 02:54:11,637
LIAM: Whisper goes to the window at that guy
there.

2080
02:54:11,637 --> 02:54:13,285
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

2081
02:54:13,285 --> 02:54:15,772
LIAM: And it's flanking, right? Because of where
Grog is, or Keyleth?

2082
02:54:15,772 --> 02:54:18,417
MATT: It's not flanking, but you get to add
sneak attack modifier.

2083
02:54:18,417 --> 02:54:21,498
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That's 32.

2084
02:54:21,498 --> 02:54:25,160
MATT: Yeah, that hits. So you appear next to it.

2085
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:46,031
LIAM: Three plus psychic damage is four plus this
junk. (counting) 33, doubled to 66 plus psychic

2086
02:54:46,031 --> 02:54:50,221
damage is 74. Bamf there.

2087
02:54:50,221 --> 02:54:55,833
MATT: And you appear next to it. As the dagger
sinks into its torso, you watch as its chest

2088
02:54:55,833 --> 02:55:00,735
muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it
seems to swallow the dagger. As it goes inside,

2089
02:55:00,735 --> 02:55:04,678
you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden
(squelch) fall off of its body, like whatever

2090
02:55:04,678 --> 02:55:09,495
energy's holding it together is untethered and
this weird, fleshy, stitched-together creature is

2091
02:55:09,495 --> 02:55:12,001
starting to fall apart. It's looking pretty hurt.

2092
02:55:12,001 --> 02:55:15,984
LIAM: Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So
movement-- and I have action-action, action,

2093
02:55:15,984 --> 02:55:18,077
action-- action-action, action, bonus action.

2094
02:55:18,077 --> 02:55:19,946
TRAVIS, LAURA, and MARISHA: (repeating) Action,
action--

2095
02:55:19,946 --> 02:55:22,539
LIAM: Guys, it's the rules in the book! You can
bust my balls all you want--

2096
02:55:22,539 --> 02:55:24,769
MATT: Well, that's your first attack, so you have
your second attack.

2097
02:55:24,769 --> 02:55:26,844
LIAM: So action-action for my regular attack,
right?

2098
02:55:26,844 --> 02:55:28,052
MATT: Attack-attack!

2099
02:55:28,052 --> 02:55:35,042
LIAM: It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted
action, bonus action. So that was the first of my

2100
02:55:35,042 --> 02:55:36,954
attack-attacks. And here's the second one.

2101
02:55:36,954 --> 02:55:38,615
MATT: Okay.

2102
02:55:38,615 --> 02:55:40,130
LIAM: 30.

2103
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:44,963
MATT: Well, we have dagger, dagger, dagger. Now we
have attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,

2104
02:55:44,963 --> 02:55:46,748
attack as our next t-shirt.

2105
02:55:46,748 --> 02:55:49,222
(laughter)

2106
02:55:49,222 --> 02:55:59,526
LIAM: I'm dumping a level two Smite into this,
against an undead. That's seven, 10, 11. Ooh, it's

2107
02:55:59,526 --> 02:56:05,381
cocked. 17 for that hit.

2108
02:56:05,381 --> 02:56:07,773
MATT: 17 with the additional--?

2109
02:56:07,773 --> 02:56:09,520
LIAM: With attack-attack.

2110
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:12,780
MATT: Right. Well, but you said you dumped Divine
Smite into that?

2111
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:13,911
LIAM: Into that one.

2112
02:56:13,911 --> 02:56:16,979
MATT: You did the additional damage for it being
undead? Okay, so that was how much total?

2113
02:56:16,979 --> 02:56:18,250
LIAM: Whatever I just said. It was like 16.

2114
02:56:18,250 --> 02:56:19,286
TRAVIS: 17.

2115
02:56:19,286 --> 02:56:26,315
MATT: 17. 17 will do it, actually. So as you rush
in with the second dagger, you jam up into the

2116
02:56:26,315 --> 02:56:30,908
same space where it's falling apart, and you hear
this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the

2117
02:56:30,908 --> 02:56:37,030
divine energy radiates from the strike and its
body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and

2118
02:56:37,030 --> 02:56:44,459
around your arm. It slowly falls around your arm
like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the

2119
02:56:44,459 --> 02:56:46,636
ground, covering the floor around you.

2120
02:56:46,636 --> 02:56:52,349
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to do the old crouch. Not
that she needs it, but crouch in front of Keyleth.

2121
02:56:52,349 --> 02:56:58,539
And then I have my hasted action for an attack and
bonus action for an attack into the other one.

2122
02:56:58,539 --> 02:57:10,986
29, and the second one is higher than 29. I'm
going to dump Smite into it. Three-- you're making

2123
02:57:10,986 --> 02:57:12,904
me mess up the math, Laura!

2124
02:57:12,904 --> 02:57:15,659
LAURA: Psychic damage.

2125
02:57:15,659 --> 02:57:19,397
LIAM: (laughing) I can't keep track of the math!

2126
02:57:19,397 --> 02:57:23,184
MATT: (singing) Epic-level DND!

2127
02:57:23,184 --> 02:57:35,612
LIAM: 25 on that towards that guy, with Smite
added. And then the last dagger, with Smite, at

2128
02:57:35,612 --> 02:57:42,796
level one, is two plus is 10, 14, 19.

2129
02:57:42,796 --> 02:57:44,128
MATT: 19, okay.

2130
02:57:44,128 --> 02:57:46,155
LIAM: I dumped a ton of Smite into that.

2131
02:57:46,155 --> 02:57:49,560
MATT: You didn't add your modifier to the third
strike, right?

2132
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:57,356
LIAM: I don't know, so why don't you just minus
six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might

2133
02:57:57,356 --> 02:58:00,389
have been catcalling me while I was trying to do
math.

2134
02:58:00,389 --> 02:58:06,019
MATT: That's okay. No worries. You hit with the
two final strikes. They blast into it. You watch

2135
02:58:06,019 --> 02:58:10,768
as some of the armor gets thrown off its body. It
takes a little hit, but the other creature looks

2136
02:58:10,768 --> 02:58:13,852
like it's largely all right. That finishes Vax's
turn.

2137
02:58:13,852 --> 02:58:17,129
LIAM: Let me enjoy my last two months of life!

2138
02:58:17,129 --> 02:58:21,753
MATT: Shadow ghast. What's the DC on the sphere
again?

2139
02:58:21,753 --> 02:58:23,414
SAM: 20.

2140
02:58:23,414 --> 02:58:28,787
MATT: Is it 20? 19. He can't escape from this
freaking sphere. The shadow ghast is up on the

2141
02:58:28,787 --> 02:58:37,030
second floor going (growling). Manners, man. All
right. Scanlan and Sprigg, what do you guys want

2142
02:58:37,030 --> 02:58:38,209
to do?

2143
02:58:38,209 --> 02:58:43,088
DARIN: I have a question. The gentleman who had an
arrow in his throat: he's gone, right? He's been

2144
02:58:43,088 --> 02:58:44,299
blown apart.

2145
02:58:44,299 --> 02:58:45,987
MATT: Yeah. Actually, make a perception check.

2146
02:58:45,987 --> 02:58:47,352
DARIN: Okay. That's a d20, isn't it?

2147
02:58:47,352 --> 02:58:48,943
MATT: Yep, d20 and then add your perception
modifier.

2148
02:58:48,943 --> 02:58:52,755
DARIN: Got it. That's a 17.

2149
02:58:52,755 --> 02:58:58,403
MATT: A 17, okay. You glance over and you see two
guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side

2150
02:58:58,403 --> 02:58:59,490
there.

2151
02:58:59,490 --> 02:59:08,856
DARIN: Now, it's too far away to cast a spell.

2152
02:59:08,856 --> 02:59:12,049
MATT: No, depending on the spell's range,
depending on what you want to do.

2153
02:59:12,049 --> 02:59:13,763
DARIN: Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

2154
02:59:13,763 --> 02:59:15,425
MATT: That we can do.

2155
02:59:15,425 --> 02:59:17,332
MARISHA: That's such a good spell.

2156
02:59:17,332 --> 02:59:27,781
MATT: It's a fun one. So bringing up Tasha's here,
looking at the range. There we go. It's a 30-feet

2157
02:59:27,781 --> 02:59:29,891
range, so you want to get up and get a little
closer, probably.

2158
02:59:29,891 --> 02:59:31,409
DARIN: I will do that, if I could.

2159
02:59:31,409 --> 02:59:38,023
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement, and
you can move two more spaces. You can hit one guy.

2160
02:59:38,023 --> 02:59:41,349
So one guy of these two you can select.

2161
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:42,647
DARIN: The first one.

2162
02:59:42,647 --> 02:59:44,076
MATT: That one there? All righty.

2163
02:59:44,076 --> 02:59:48,911
DARIN: Yes. I think his name is Dave? Roll a
perception?

2164
02:59:48,911 --> 03:00:00,457
MATT: Make a saving throw, a wisdom save. That is
a ten! Your spell DC is a 17. You watch as the

2165
03:00:00,457 --> 03:00:04,845
guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you
get up, spins around, has this giant, heavy

2166
03:00:04,845 --> 03:00:10,259
crossbow, the bolt very recognizable because you
still have three of them in your body. Aims it

2167
03:00:10,259 --> 03:00:16,821
towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter)
and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles

2168
03:00:16,821 --> 03:00:21,089
over laughing, falling to the ground and is now
kicking and laughing like a hyena right now,

2169
03:00:21,089 --> 03:00:23,013
unable to do anything.

2170
03:00:23,013 --> 03:00:24,821
DARIN: Knock knock!

2171
03:00:24,821 --> 03:00:27,748
MATT: (maniacal laughter)

2172
03:00:27,748 --> 03:00:28,857
DARIN: Right!

2173
03:00:28,857 --> 03:00:31,714
(laughter)

2174
03:00:31,714 --> 03:00:34,702
MATT: All right, is that your turn?

2175
03:00:34,702 --> 03:00:35,682
DARIN: Yes, it is.

2176
03:00:35,682 --> 03:00:36,704
MATT: All right.

2177
03:00:36,704 --> 03:00:41,489
SAM: There's another guy over there? Have I seen
him yet?

2178
03:00:41,489 --> 03:00:46,431
MATT: You haven't, actually. You do see this guy's
on fire right now, who is still around.

2179
03:00:46,431 --> 03:00:47,827
SAM: Oh, I see somebody.

2180
03:00:47,827 --> 03:00:50,468
MATT: Yeah, and you can see that hulking figure
come running through, and you hear the (explosion)

2181
03:00:50,468 --> 03:00:51,940
through the back of the building.

2182
03:00:51,940 --> 03:00:57,688
SAM: For the beginning of the round, I'll say,
guys, I think large giants are coming. Be aware.

2183
03:00:57,688 --> 03:01:00,349
LAURA and TRAVIS: (screaming)

2184
03:01:00,349 --> 03:01:03,075
SAM: What? I can't hear you! Speak clearly!

2185
03:01:03,075 --> 03:01:04,943
LIAM: Threepio! Where could he be?!

2186
03:01:04,943 --> 03:01:17,899
SAM: Okay. Shit. I'll approach the guy I can see
burning, on fire. That's where the front door is,

2187
03:01:17,899 --> 03:01:20,185
right? Is he in front of the front door?

2188
03:01:20,185 --> 03:01:23,097
MATT: The log is right up in this area.

2189
03:01:23,097 --> 03:01:34,090
SAM: Oh yeah. That. So I'll take out my Wand of
Magic Missiles, and I will just take down

2190
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:35,361
the rope.

2191
03:01:35,361 --> 03:01:41,302
MATT: Okay. You watch as three missiles fire out
of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top.

2192
03:01:41,367 --> 03:01:47,491
As they explode, it's enough of an impact to cause
it, as opposed to fall straight down, just spin

2193
03:01:47,491 --> 03:01:52,596
and fall. I'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to
see which direction it's going to land from its

2194
03:01:52,596 --> 03:02:01,714
front point. So we'll say inward would be one,
two, three, four, five, six. That's a six. So it

2195
03:02:01,714 --> 03:02:07,387
plummets down, hits the ceiling, scrapes off and
slams down onto him. He's going to try and make a

2196
03:02:07,387 --> 03:02:16,670
dexterity saving throw. That is a seven plus four,
nope. That's an 11. Go ahead and roll 4d8 please.

2197
03:02:16,670 --> 03:02:18,646
LAURA: 4d8?

2198
03:02:18,646 --> 03:02:22,193
DARIN: Is this Dr. Comedy, who's writhing in
laughter?

2199
03:02:22,193 --> 03:02:26,059
MATT: I think so. Oh. No, sorry, he's over here.
This guy's on fire from her earlier.

2200
03:02:26,059 --> 03:02:33,885
SAM: Oh, that's a five. 16.

2201
03:02:33,885 --> 03:02:37,746
MATT: 16 points of damage to him.

2202
03:02:37,746 --> 03:02:39,577
SAM: That's not a lot.

2203
03:02:39,577 --> 03:02:41,798
LAURA: You only got 16 on 4d8?

2204
03:02:41,798 --> 03:02:47,214
MATT: It's not enough to kill him, but it slams on
him and then falls over. You see as both of his

2205
03:02:47,214 --> 03:02:52,150
flaming hands on the ground going, (groans). He's
currently restrained underneath it right there,

2206
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:53,643
and on fire.

2207
03:02:53,643 --> 03:02:55,839
DARIN: Knock knock.

2208
03:02:55,839 --> 03:02:58,693
(laughter)

2209
03:02:58,693 --> 03:03:00,617
MATT: All right, you going to stay where you are?

2210
03:03:00,617 --> 03:03:03,585
SAM: No. I'm going to move towards any entrance or
window I see. I can't really see over there.

2211
03:03:03,585 --> 03:03:07,543
MATT: There's a window here, window here. This one
has flames in front of it. This one's available.

2212
03:03:07,543 --> 03:03:19,166
SAM: I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.

2213
03:03:19,166 --> 03:03:23,245
MATT: Okay. Four, five. That's as far as you can
move there. You see the guy on the ground who's

2214
03:03:23,245 --> 03:03:24,847
laughing in front of you.

2215
03:03:24,847 --> 03:03:30,961
SAM: Yeah, no thanks to him. And for a bonus, I
guess I will inspire Darin De Paul, or rather,

2216
03:03:30,961 --> 03:03:32,657
Sprigg.

2217
03:03:32,657 --> 03:03:34,589
LIAM: Why not both?

2218
03:03:34,589 --> 03:03:44,173
SAM: I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad
day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song

2219
03:03:44,173 --> 03:03:52,551
just to turn it around! You say you don't know,
but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and

2220
03:03:52,551 --> 03:03:57,863
maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day.
(speaking) I don't know how that song goes.

2221
03:03:57,863 --> 03:04:02,902
MATT: All righty, so you get an inspiration die.
You get a d12 that you can use on any sort of

2222
03:04:02,902 --> 03:04:06,451
skill. You don't have to use it right now, but
whenever you use a skill check or an ability check

2223
03:04:06,451 --> 03:04:09,550
you can add that to it if you want to. There you
go.

2224
03:04:09,550 --> 03:04:12,600
DARIN: Thank you. You know, I had a bad day.

2225
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:14,411
SAM: (singing) You had a bad day.

2226
03:04:14,411 --> 03:04:18,008
(groaning and laughing)

2227
03:04:18,008 --> 03:04:22,312
MATT: All right, so now it's the assassin's turn.
Keyleth, how much fire damage does it do when

2228
03:04:22,312 --> 03:04:23,776
they're on fire? Is it d10?

2229
03:04:23,776 --> 03:04:34,723
MARISHA: (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah,
no. d10.

2230
03:04:34,723 --> 03:04:38,387
MATT: Thought so. All right, he takes eight fire
damage.

2231
03:04:38,387 --> 03:04:40,695
TALIESIN: Yay! Under a log.

2232
03:04:40,695 --> 03:04:49,373
MATT: Under a log. He's going to try and break
free from restraint. Nope, that is a 14. He cannot

2233
03:04:49,373 --> 03:04:53,974
move that giant tree that's currently crushing him
on the ground. He tries to reach out for his

2234
03:04:53,974 --> 03:04:59,517
crossbow and aim it out towards Sprigg with one
hand because it's still loaded. But he has super

2235
03:04:59,517 --> 03:05:01,149
disadvantage on this strike.

2236
03:05:01,149 --> 03:05:03,285
SAM: Super disadvantage. Is that in the book?

2237
03:05:03,285 --> 03:05:05,020
MATT: It is now.

2238
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:09,387
LAURA: That's in the new campaign guide. Super
disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree

2239
03:05:09,387 --> 03:05:10,648
on fire.

2240
03:05:10,648 --> 03:05:19,427
MATT: Sure, I'll do all three. All right. Eight, 12,
12. I made him roll super disadvantage. What does

2241
03:05:19,427 --> 03:05:24,403
this remind me of? Like a terrible old sci-fi
movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the

2242
03:05:24,403 --> 03:05:28,403
gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final
shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the

2243
03:05:28,403 --> 03:05:33,526
gun. You (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires.
Nothing on you.

2244
03:05:33,526 --> 03:05:34,518
DARIN: Of course.

2245
03:05:34,518 --> 03:05:36,762
MATT: The crossbow drops, (grunting).

2246
03:05:36,762 --> 03:05:39,070
DARIN: Knock knock.

2247
03:05:39,070 --> 03:05:45,418
MATT: (crying) On fire. All righty, that ends his
turn.

2248
03:05:45,418 --> 03:05:47,799
DARIN: (whispering) Comedy comes in threes.

2249
03:05:47,799 --> 03:05:54,542
MATT: This guy back here is going to go ahead and
since you're the one who has his friend writhing

2250
03:05:54,542 --> 03:05:58,916
on the ground, is going to go ahead and try to
shoot you with his crossbow. You do see him,

2251
03:05:58,916 --> 03:06:05,820
although he's unaware of that, so he thinks it's a
sneak attack shot. That is a 14.

2252
03:06:05,820 --> 03:06:07,431
TALIESIN: You got to get better cultists, man.

2253
03:06:07,431 --> 03:06:12,068
MATT: I know, seriously. They come in large
numbers, so yeah. This one just (impact sound)

2254
03:06:12,068 --> 03:06:14,116
hits the tree to your left. His aim's off.

2255
03:06:14,116 --> 03:06:16,411
TRAVIS: He's missing an eye. His depth perception
sucks.

2256
03:06:16,411 --> 03:06:21,900
MATT: Exactly. And he goes ahead and darts behind
this building there, vanishing.

2257
03:06:21,900 --> 03:06:24,687
SAM: Did I see the bolt or any indication that he
exists?

2258
03:06:24,687 --> 03:06:26,937
MATT: You do. He reveals himself when he fires. So
you watched him come out of the bushes and

2259
03:06:26,937 --> 03:06:30,531
(whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the
building. The guy on the ground is going to try

2260
03:06:30,531 --> 03:06:35,163
and save against your spell. That is a 13 plus
zero. Nope. He's still laughing. He's just on the

2261
03:06:35,163 --> 03:06:37,932
ground, (laughing). Tears in his eyes now.

2262
03:06:37,932 --> 03:06:40,890
TALIESIN: I love that spell.

2263
03:06:40,890 --> 03:06:44,851
MATT: That's the end of the assassins' turn.
Necro's dead. Vex, you're up.

2264
03:06:44,851 --> 03:06:53,003
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead
monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot

2265
03:06:53,003 --> 03:06:55,632
him! With the Blazing Bowstring!

2266
03:06:55,632 --> 03:06:58,373
TALIESIN: Be careful. You might catch the building
on fire.

2267
03:06:58,373 --> 03:07:01,974
LAURA: Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter
thing.

2268
03:07:01,974 --> 03:07:04,651
MATT: Take minus five and do additional damage?
Okay.

2269
03:07:04,651 --> 03:07:09,016
LAURA: Which I don't know if I should have done
that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit.

2270
03:07:09,016 --> 03:07:11,764
MATT: 17 is exactly his armor class.

2271
03:07:11,764 --> 03:07:14,543
LIAM: Yas, Pelor queen!

2272
03:07:14,543 --> 03:07:16,963
(laughter)

2273
03:07:16,963 --> 03:07:37,402
LAURA: Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack,
because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23,

2274
03:07:37,402 --> 03:07:50,045
sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26.
And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27.

2275
03:07:50,045 --> 03:07:53,393
MATT: Okay, 27. So that's your first strike.
(arrow shot) First one just (impact sound) hits in

2276
03:07:53,393 --> 03:07:57,946
the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out
and the flames burn up the arrow. By the way, the

2277
03:07:57,946 --> 03:08:00,578
wall behind you is starting to get really warm.

2278
03:08:00,578 --> 03:08:09,256
LAURA: I'm going to move forward. I'm going to
actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is.

2279
03:08:09,256 --> 03:08:12,153
MATT: There's a guy on the ground there.

2280
03:08:12,153 --> 03:08:13,372
LAURA: Oh, there is?

2281
03:08:13,372 --> 03:08:14,818
MATT: Yeah. So you've got to step over him.

2282
03:08:14,818 --> 03:08:16,217
LAURA: I'm going to step on him.

2283
03:08:16,217 --> 03:08:22,806
MATT: As you move past, he does get a swing with
his shortsword at you. Oh, wow. That's a 25.

2284
03:08:22,806 --> 03:08:24,959
LAURA: Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I
stepped on him.

2285
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:30,565
MATT: I think so. So you take nine points of
slashing damage. Just like, (pain sound) as you're

2286
03:08:30,565 --> 03:08:31,959
walking past.

2287
03:08:31,959 --> 03:08:38,985
LAURA: (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm
going to hit the big hulking thing again.

2288
03:08:38,985 --> 03:08:41,318
MATT: I realized he had disadvantage, but I rolled
another 18, so it's fine.

2289
03:08:41,318 --> 03:08:47,739
LAURA: Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the
same thing with the big hulking guy.

2290
03:08:47,739 --> 03:08:48,884
MATT: Okay.

2291
03:08:48,884 --> 03:08:53,025
LAURA: 25 to hit.

2292
03:08:53,025 --> 03:08:54,281
MATT: 25 hits.

2293
03:08:54,281 --> 03:08:57,325
LAURA: Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous
one!

2294
03:08:57,325 --> 03:09:03,398
MATT: Because of the sharpshooter, all right. 39
last time. So go ahead and take a swing at it.

2295
03:09:03,398 --> 03:09:06,817
LAURA: Thanks! 14.

2296
03:09:06,817 --> 03:09:09,356
MATT: You're up next, Keyleth.

2297
03:09:09,356 --> 03:09:11,422
LAURA: 14 plus six is 20.

2298
03:09:11,422 --> 03:09:16,716
SAM: Figure out how you're going to ruin Darin's
life more.

2299
03:09:16,716 --> 03:09:23,076
MARISHA: I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a
big old homewrecker.

2300
03:09:23,076 --> 03:09:26,214
LAURA: I think that's just 32 because I don't get
sneak attack again.

2301
03:09:26,214 --> 03:09:32,108
MATT: All right. So the second arrow slams into
him. It's still holding firm. It's taking the hits

2302
03:09:32,108 --> 03:09:38,015
and you see parts of its body are starting to
spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls)

2303
03:09:38,015 --> 03:09:43,297
its red eyes still beaming out from behind the
metal mask in front of its face. Its arm swings

2304
03:09:43,297 --> 03:09:48,671
back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with
it. It's looking pretty rickety right now. So that

2305
03:09:48,671 --> 03:09:49,719
ends your turn?

2306
03:09:49,719 --> 03:09:50,649
LAURA: I guess so.

2307
03:09:50,649 --> 03:09:53,814
MARISHA: Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay!

2308
03:09:53,814 --> 03:09:55,342
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

2309
03:09:55,342 --> 03:10:02,642
MARISHA: All right. So I have this big asshole in
front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire,

2310
03:10:02,642 --> 03:10:13,429
right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and
really angry. So continuing what I was saying

2311
03:10:13,429 --> 03:10:20,541
before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go
into her fire elemental self.

2312
03:10:20,541 --> 03:10:21,931
MATT: Okay.

2313
03:10:21,931 --> 03:10:26,791
MARISHA: Unable to contain her frustration--

2314
03:10:26,791 --> 03:10:28,877
TALIESIN: This is a good plan.

2315
03:10:28,877 --> 03:10:39,751
MATT: You technically entered the space of the guy
who's on the ground, becoming a fire elemental,

2316
03:10:39,751 --> 03:10:42,932
which lights him on fire. (screams)

2317
03:10:42,932 --> 03:10:50,234
MARISHA: Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in
the space of this guy.

2318
03:10:50,234 --> 03:10:58,579
MATT: (whoosh) So occupying his space from this
side, we'll say. She can catch you guys on fire.

2319
03:10:58,579 --> 03:11:00,120
LAURA: But she doesn't have to.

2320
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:01,320
MATT: I'll double-check that real fast.

2321
03:11:01,320 --> 03:11:04,930
MARISHA: I mean, I'm magical.

2322
03:11:04,930 --> 03:11:06,394
TALIESIN: Sparkle fire.

2323
03:11:06,394 --> 03:11:08,219
MARISHA: I sparkle fire.

2324
03:11:08,219 --> 03:11:09,625
LIAM: Also, we can take it.

2325
03:11:09,625 --> 03:11:11,114
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's fire.

2326
03:11:11,114 --> 03:11:20,109
MATT: You know what? It can move through a space
as narrow as one inch wide, so I'll say yes, you

2327
03:11:20,109 --> 03:11:23,244
can maneuver through. Only if you want to, can you
set things on fire.

2328
03:11:23,244 --> 03:11:29,863
MARISHA: I'm going to go into this guy's space,
engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam

2329
03:11:29,863 --> 03:11:30,951
touch attacks.

2330
03:11:30,951 --> 03:11:34,622
MATT: Go for it. He is now in flames.

2331
03:11:34,622 --> 03:11:41,247
MARISHA: That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's
good. 21.

2332
03:11:41,247 --> 03:11:43,089
MATT: 21, yeah.

2333
03:11:43,089 --> 03:11:46,528
MARISHA: And 16.

2334
03:11:46,528 --> 03:11:48,218
MATT: 16 just misses.

2335
03:11:48,218 --> 03:11:52,438
MARISHA: Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11.
That's 17.

2336
03:11:52,438 --> 03:11:55,342
MATT: That hits. That's what you needed.

2337
03:11:55,342 --> 03:12:14,736
MARISHA: So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three.
First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.

2338
03:12:14,736 --> 03:12:25,843
MATT: He's looking pretty hurt. As you slam him
with both of your flaming hands and claw across

2339
03:12:25,843 --> 03:12:30,641
his body, where the flame hits, you see it
(hissing) singes through the flesh and drags

2340
03:12:30,641 --> 03:12:35,937
charred remains of where the muscle once was where you
dragged your claws through. The body's starting to

2341
03:12:35,937 --> 03:12:39,763
shake as it's holding its form together.

2342
03:12:39,763 --> 03:12:42,977
MARISHA: That's all I've got, I think. That's it.

2343
03:12:42,977 --> 03:12:44,903
SAM: No. You have action, action, action, action,
action.

2344
03:12:44,903 --> 03:12:46,682
(laughter)

2345
03:12:46,682 --> 03:12:48,144
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bonus action.

2346
03:12:48,144 --> 03:12:49,872
LAURA: Hasted action.

2347
03:12:49,872 --> 03:12:54,946
LIAM: Send all your complaints to Mike Mearls and
Chris Perkins at Wizards of the Coast.

2348
03:12:54,946 --> 03:13:02,558
SAM: Matt, not to be a dick, but has anyone
stepped on the trap on the floor?

2349
03:13:02,558 --> 03:13:13,054
MATT: Actually, you know what, Vax would have
avoided it. Because Vax is in the spot where it

2350
03:13:13,054 --> 03:13:16,600
was, but Vax knew where it was, so Vax would have
probably gone over it.

2351
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:20,749
SAM: So cool. You're doing the little splits over
it.

2352
03:13:20,903 --> 03:13:22,609
LIAM: Splitsing. Van Damme-ing it.

2353
03:13:22,609 --> 03:13:25,435
MATT: Wait, you wouldn't have, because when you
threw the dagger--

2354
03:13:25,435 --> 03:13:26,757
LIAM: Let's do it.

2355
03:13:26,757 --> 03:13:31,176
MATT: It's not a big deal. Thank you for pointing
that out.

2356
03:13:31,176 --> 03:13:33,449
SAM: But your boots are gone.

2357
03:13:33,449 --> 03:13:36,322
LIAM: She stole them again? How did you do it?

2358
03:13:36,322 --> 03:13:42,887
MATT: You guys glance upward as you hear a (deep
swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the

2359
03:13:42,887 --> 03:13:54,694
ceiling where there once was nothing but air, you
see hovering above you a giant beholder just

2360
03:13:54,694 --> 03:13:59,075
appear. (guttural moan) All of its eyestalks
curling around it.

2361
03:13:59,075 --> 03:14:05,774
MARISHA: What do you mean, it's not a big deal?
That's the part that I'm confused about!

2362
03:14:05,774 --> 03:14:12,386
MATT: Thank you for that. So that finishes your
turn, Keyleth. Pike's turn. Pike sees this--

2363
03:14:12,386 --> 03:14:17,570
LIAM: If we're retconning that in, I'm retconning
(blows raspberry) when I see it.

2364
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:19,872
DARIN: Don't get Gargamel angry.

2365
03:14:19,872 --> 03:14:27,156
MARISHA: Does that mean that Keyleth would have
seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't

2366
03:14:27,156 --> 03:14:28,206
worry about it.

2367
03:14:28,206 --> 03:14:32,621
MATT: No. You were so angry-- it's in the hole
above. You don't quite see where that hole was at

2368
03:14:32,621 --> 03:14:34,314
the moment, you backed away.

2369
03:14:34,314 --> 03:14:37,082
MARISHA: Man, so much blind rage.

2370
03:14:37,082 --> 03:14:42,986
MATT: So much blind rage. Look guys, that's what
we're doing. So anyway, Pike does actually make an

2371
03:14:42,986 --> 03:14:46,304
insight check, and says, "It's not real. Don't
worry about it!"

2372
03:14:46,304 --> 03:14:48,561
LAURA: Thanks, Pike.

2373
03:14:48,561 --> 03:14:50,981
MATT: Fixed.

2374
03:14:50,981 --> 03:14:54,521
(laughter)

2375
03:14:54,521 --> 03:14:56,379
LAURA: It's not a big deal, you guys.

2376
03:14:56,379 --> 03:15:04,749
MATT: Pike, however, is going to go ahead and make
another Guiding Bolt at the large guy there.

2377
03:15:04,749 --> 03:15:18,727
That's going to be a 20. That hits. That's going
to be 4d6. 14 points of radiant damage, which will

2378
03:15:18,727 --> 03:15:25,298
do it. So you watch as Pike blasts it in the face
with the Guiding Bolt. As it hits, the mask gets

2379
03:15:25,298 --> 03:15:33,572
thrown off, and where the head was beneath it, you
see this empty black void with two red burning

2380
03:15:33,572 --> 03:15:38,969
coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask
is removed, and the whole body crumples to the

2381
03:15:38,969 --> 03:15:42,805
ground and turns into a horrible, thick,
black-purple ichor.

2382
03:15:42,805 --> 03:15:44,760
LAURA: I'm going to have nightmares about that.

2383
03:15:44,760 --> 03:15:46,554
SAM: For sure.

2384
03:15:46,554 --> 03:15:53,061
MATT: The beholder is still upstairs, staying in
place going (hoarse screaming).

2385
03:15:53,061 --> 03:15:59,106
(laughter)

2386
03:15:59,106 --> 03:16:01,114
MATT: Yeah, it's that kind of thing.

2387
03:16:01,114 --> 03:16:03,025
TALIESIN: Brilliant.

2388
03:16:03,025 --> 03:16:09,247
MATT: That ends Pike's turn. They're both dead.
That brings us back. Percival, it's your turn.

2389
03:16:09,247 --> 03:16:12,657
There's the one guy on the ground there. One's
laughing. We'll say for the purposes of this, for

2390
03:16:12,657 --> 03:16:18,859
the time, most everything there is not much of a
threat at this point. So systematically, the guy

2391
03:16:18,859 --> 03:16:20,892
on the ground who's hidden by the tree, you can
just--

2392
03:16:20,892 --> 03:16:23,966
TALIESIN: I'm ignoring him. I'm not even gonna
deal. I'm just hopping in the window. I'm going to

2393
03:16:23,966 --> 03:16:28,119
grab my little guy there. I'm going to bring him
out to the balcony, and I'm going to

2394
03:16:28,119 --> 03:16:30,454
unceremoniously toss him out of the house.

2395
03:16:30,454 --> 03:16:31,904
SAM: Defenestrated!

2396
03:16:31,904 --> 03:16:35,673
MATT: You throw him (thud). He lands.

2397
03:16:35,673 --> 03:16:39,397
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to jump and I'm going
to crawl down the rest of my way and join him

2398
03:16:39,397 --> 03:16:44,495
outside the house. And try and jump around the
fire, dragging him away from the fire.

2399
03:16:44,495 --> 03:16:46,684
MATT: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics
check.

2400
03:16:46,684 --> 03:16:52,962
TALIESIN: Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics
check. I'm rerolling that.

2401
03:16:52,962 --> 03:16:55,429
MATT: No, it's not a saving throw. You can't do
that.

2402
03:16:55,429 --> 03:16:58,264
TALIESIN: It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's
fine. That's a 16.

2403
03:16:58,264 --> 03:17:00,582
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of this--

2404
03:17:00,582 --> 03:17:02,055
TALIESIN: I had the Spider Climb boots.

2405
03:17:02,055 --> 03:17:07,603
MATT: Right, I know. But Spider Climb boots only
helps you if you keep on the surface. So as you

2406
03:17:07,603 --> 03:17:12,773
leap, you manage to land on your feet, but the
flames do catch you a bit, so you take six points

2407
03:17:12,773 --> 03:17:25,118
of fire damage as you start to burn. For the
purposes of time on this one, the guy who's

2408
03:17:25,118 --> 03:17:28,821
currently under the log just burns to death there
under the log. Pinned, he's trying to reach for

2409
03:17:28,821 --> 03:17:33,194
his crossbow, but he's only fired the one bolt
that was loaded in it. The guy on the ground is

2410
03:17:33,194 --> 03:17:35,379
still laughing as you approach him.

2411
03:17:35,379 --> 03:17:37,507
DARIN: Are there any rocks about?

2412
03:17:37,507 --> 03:17:40,079
MATT: Yeah, there's quite a few heavier rocks on
the ground.

2413
03:17:40,079 --> 03:17:45,784
DARIN: Well, I look at him, and I say, "It was a
prison, but it was my prison." And I use the

2414
03:17:45,784 --> 03:17:49,404
Telekinesis ring to lift a rock and drop it on his
head.

2415
03:17:49,404 --> 03:17:54,792
MATT: (splat) A horrible sickening crack sound. It
slams into the head. You lift it up. The laughing

2416
03:17:54,792 --> 03:18:00,429
has stopped, but he's still moving and you can see
the face is broken. The nose is smashed to the

2417
03:18:00,429 --> 03:18:03,409
side and it's just blood. He's starting to try and
get back up.

2418
03:18:03,409 --> 03:18:10,125
DARIN: Well, tell them that Ethred Brokenbranch
sends his regards.

2419
03:18:10,125 --> 03:18:13,026
MATT: Do you let him get up?

2420
03:18:13,026 --> 03:18:14,747
DARIN: Yes.

2421
03:18:14,747 --> 03:18:17,858
MATT: He gets up. (grunting)

2422
03:18:17,858 --> 03:18:21,146
SAM: I'll Lightning Bolt him as he runs away.

2423
03:18:21,146 --> 03:18:29,836
MATT: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of this, he
runs off in the distance (footsteps, yelp) and

2424
03:18:29,836 --> 03:18:31,655
falls to the ground, no longer moving.

2425
03:18:31,655 --> 03:18:37,949
TRAVIS: Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be
mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy

2426
03:18:37,949 --> 03:18:39,684
that's lying on the floor in the house, please?

2427
03:18:39,684 --> 03:18:41,199
TALIESIN: Just sit on him.

2428
03:18:41,199 --> 03:18:44,688
TRAVIS: I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while.

2429
03:18:44,688 --> 03:18:49,349
MATT: He's on the ground on fire now, going
(frantic gasps) patting out the fire.

2430
03:18:49,349 --> 03:18:50,775
LAURA: Oh, Grog, put him out!

2431
03:18:50,775 --> 03:18:53,208
MATT: He spends his action putting the fire out
now, and is like, (frantic gasps).

2432
03:18:53,208 --> 03:18:56,748
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a few steps back and
motions as a fire elemental...

2433
03:18:56,748 --> 03:19:00,866
TRAVIS: I skip on in and (gibberish yell).

2434
03:19:00,866 --> 03:19:08,231
MATT: He's like, (scream, impact). Just smashed on
the ground. Red watermelon.

2435
03:19:08,231 --> 03:19:10,426
LAURA: Fire's out, I'm assuming.

2436
03:19:10,426 --> 03:19:18,428
MARISHA: I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger,
destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a

2437
03:19:18,428 --> 03:19:22,885
Tidal Wave to quell the flames.

2438
03:19:22,885 --> 03:19:34,305
MATT: The building is standing, mostly. The whole
front of it is blackened. The flames are gone.

2439
03:19:34,305 --> 03:19:38,663
Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two
giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling

2440
03:19:38,663 --> 03:19:41,926
is ruined. The house is in shambles.

2441
03:19:41,926 --> 03:19:44,064
LAURA: What about the books?

2442
03:19:44,064 --> 03:19:47,305
MATT: A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of
the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some

2443
03:19:47,305 --> 03:19:53,876
of them have been burned by people in flames or
made of flame or general black ichor that spilled

2444
03:19:53,876 --> 03:19:56,327
out. The house is pretty wrecked.

2445
03:19:56,327 --> 03:19:59,556
LAURA: Can I go over to them and see if I can find
some books I think Percy would like?

2446
03:19:59,556 --> 03:20:01,297
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2447
03:20:01,297 --> 03:20:05,051
SAM: I'm running over to see that staff with an
eye in it.

2448
03:20:05,051 --> 03:20:07,428
LAURA: 27.

2449
03:20:07,428 --> 03:20:15,402
MATT: 27? Okay. You start glancing through. You
find some history books. You find some that relate

2450
03:20:15,402 --> 03:20:23,005
to local history. You see some books that relate
to various types of creatures; some animals and

2451
03:20:23,005 --> 03:20:31,641
beasts. Many that are encyclopedias of various
rivers and it's scattered everywhere. It's just

2452
03:20:31,641 --> 03:20:38,843
universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can
get his hands on. So some of it seems less useful

2453
03:20:38,843 --> 03:20:42,415
than others but you hand-pick a few out that you
think Percy would like.

2454
03:20:42,415 --> 03:20:47,276
TRAVIS: I don't mean to ask the obvious question,
but how did he know we were here?

2455
03:20:47,276 --> 03:20:51,006
TALIESIN: No, that's not an obvious question. I
have no idea.

2456
03:20:51,006 --> 03:20:52,683
MARISHA: They have multiple eyes.

2457
03:20:52,683 --> 03:20:57,160
LAURA: But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying
on us?

2458
03:20:57,160 --> 03:20:58,250
TALIESIN: Must have.

2459
03:20:58,250 --> 03:21:00,034
LAURA: Oh, he's fucking scrying on us.

2460
03:21:00,034 --> 03:21:03,741
TALIESIN: Maybe he can feel you the way you can
feel him.

2461
03:21:03,741 --> 03:21:07,739
MATT: You get the sense that's not how this
works.

2462
03:21:07,739 --> 03:21:10,873
TALIESIN: Yeah. I don't know.

2463
03:21:10,873 --> 03:21:15,883
MARISHA: He had another eye, right?

2464
03:21:15,883 --> 03:21:17,826
SAM: Does that thing have an eye in it?

2465
03:21:17,826 --> 03:21:22,740
MATT: The staff you see? It's a carved eye. It's
made of wood and paint. It's ornamental. It's

2466
03:21:22,740 --> 03:21:25,666
mainly used as a focus, technically acts as a
plus-one staff.

2467
03:21:25,666 --> 03:21:33,242
TRAVIS: Sprigg. You said this place was a prison.
Did you mean that?

2468
03:21:33,242 --> 03:21:38,417
DARIN: Of course I meant it, boy. I've been there
for years.

2469
03:21:38,417 --> 03:21:41,762
TRAVIS: Could you leave? If you wanted.

2470
03:21:41,762 --> 03:21:47,745
DARIN: Of course I can. The prison was more up
here than in there.

2471
03:21:47,745 --> 03:21:51,970
TRAVIS: Oh. Sorry about the prison, then.

2472
03:21:51,970 --> 03:22:00,198
DARIN: Why would you be sorry? I asked you for
power and redemption. Don't you feel you gave me

2473
03:22:00,198 --> 03:22:05,701
that? We lived, child. We all lived.

2474
03:22:05,701 --> 03:22:16,053
TRAVIS: Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping
for.

2475
03:22:16,053 --> 03:22:20,729
LAURA: I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg!

2476
03:22:20,729 --> 03:22:22,364
DARIN: Hello!

2477
03:22:22,364 --> 03:22:23,446
LAURA: Hi.

2478
03:22:23,446 --> 03:22:30,830
DARIN: Hi! How are you? I have some arrows in me
at the moment. You like arrows, don't you?

2479
03:22:30,830 --> 03:22:32,848
LAURA: I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your
hands.

2480
03:22:32,848 --> 03:22:38,849
DARIN: Okay. Question: if you do that, I'd
probably die again.

2481
03:22:38,849 --> 03:22:40,841
LAURA: I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry.

2482
03:22:40,841 --> 03:22:43,151
DARIN: She called me darling.

2483
03:22:43,151 --> 03:22:46,054
SAM: She's the cutest.

2484
03:22:46,054 --> 03:22:51,509
DARIN: (growls) I go in.

2485
03:22:51,509 --> 03:22:57,634
(laughter)

2486
03:22:57,634 --> 03:23:04,041
MATT: You walk into your destroyed abode, managing
to sidestep all the bear traps along the way.

2487
03:23:04,041 --> 03:23:07,564
You've walked the path many times and you know it
and I'm actually surprised none of you walked into

2488
03:23:07,564 --> 03:23:15,826
any of them. You knew where most of them were, but
none of you wandered out far enough into the open

2489
03:23:15,826 --> 03:23:23,066
to do that. They're all inside. You can see your
giant friend, of course, that you were talking to

2490
03:23:23,066 --> 03:23:28,528
as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier.
Previously where you had to hunch, you're now

2491
03:23:28,528 --> 03:23:31,459
having to almost belly crawl inside the house.

2492
03:23:31,459 --> 03:23:34,762
TRAVIS: But why? There's no separation between the
first and the second floor.

2493
03:23:34,762 --> 03:23:36,407
MATT: So if you stand in that space, you're fine.

2494
03:23:36,407 --> 03:23:41,731
TRAVIS: I'm in my space.

2495
03:23:41,731 --> 03:23:46,868
TALIESIN: I'm going to prop our idiot up in the
window so I can go in and keep an eye on him even

2496
03:23:46,868 --> 03:23:48,275
while I'm inside.

2497
03:23:48,275 --> 03:23:49,622
SAM: We have a prisoner?

2498
03:23:49,622 --> 03:23:50,898
TALIESIN: Yeah. I kept one.

2499
03:23:50,898 --> 03:23:53,856
LAURA: But he's one of those creepy ghouls that
probably doesn't speak.

2500
03:23:53,856 --> 03:23:57,482
MATT: And in the last minute or so has not been
able to break free but is still trying.

2501
03:23:57,482 --> 03:24:00,913
TALIESIN: He automatically fails until 24 hours
has elapsed.

2502
03:24:00,913 --> 03:24:02,555
MATT: After the first failed save?

2503
03:24:02,555 --> 03:24:08,527
TALIESIN: Any further attempts by the creature
automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. He

2504
03:24:08,527 --> 03:24:12,565
ain't going nowhere. It's mean, man.

2505
03:24:12,565 --> 03:24:16,105
LAURA: Me and Pike can heal him as I take the
arrows out.

2506
03:24:16,105 --> 03:24:17,225
MATT: Okay.

2507
03:24:17,225 --> 03:24:20,038
DARIN: At last you've seen the <i>point</i> of me, eh?

2508
03:24:20,038 --> 03:24:25,312
LAURA: (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable
in here that you want to save before we get you

2509
03:24:25,312 --> 03:24:26,879
out of here?

2510
03:24:26,879 --> 03:24:29,740
DARIN: Would like my organs! Oh, I would like to
save those.

2511
03:24:29,740 --> 03:24:31,022
LAURA: Yes.

2512
03:24:31,022 --> 03:24:35,230
DARIN: All right. No. There's nothing.

2513
03:24:35,230 --> 03:24:39,153
LAURA: No keys to Ioun? You know where she is?

2514
03:24:39,153 --> 03:24:47,692
DARIN: I might. I hope I do. I hope that I can
give you the answers you seek.

2515
03:24:47,692 --> 03:24:51,737
LAURA: I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds.

2516
03:24:51,737 --> 03:24:58,270
MATT: Pike casts Cure Wounds on you, as well, and
you heal 18.

2517
03:24:58,270 --> 03:24:59,699
DARIN: Do I know her name yet?

2518
03:24:59,699 --> 03:25:01,353
MATT: No, you do not.

2519
03:25:01,353 --> 03:25:02,582
DARIN: Cleric.

2520
03:25:02,582 --> 03:25:04,433
MATT: "Pike."

2521
03:25:04,433 --> 03:25:13,463
DARIN: Yes. Ethred. Or Sprigg. Whichever you like.
You can call me Sprigg. Can you help me pray to

2522
03:25:13,463 --> 03:25:19,468
Ioun? We need answers, and I think together we
might find them.

2523
03:25:19,468 --> 03:25:31,491
MATT: "I can certainly try. Do you have any items
of her iconography?"

2524
03:25:31,491 --> 03:25:34,666
DARIN: Do I?

2525
03:25:34,666 --> 03:25:42,449
MATT: Yeah, actually. You just reach over and find
one of the undamaged books.

2526
03:25:42,449 --> 03:25:45,267
LAURA: You healed 19, by the way.

2527
03:25:45,267 --> 03:25:52,179
DARIN: Thank you. Use this and you talk to her
where I can't. At least, not yet.

2528
03:25:52,179 --> 03:25:57,690
MATT: "I don't know if I can talk to her. I'm
not... But I can help you pray. I don't know if

2529
03:25:57,690 --> 03:25:58,831
"it'll be enough."

2530
03:25:58,831 --> 03:26:03,402
DARIN: Let's give it a go. There's a first time
for everything.

2531
03:26:03,402 --> 03:26:06,925
MATT: "Grog!"

2532
03:26:06,925 --> 03:26:08,091
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2533
03:26:08,091 --> 03:26:09,788
MATT: "Can you help me clear some of the floor,
please?"

2534
03:26:09,788 --> 03:26:14,033
TRAVIS: Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch!

2535
03:26:14,033 --> 03:26:15,734
MARISHA: Ah! Ow!

2536
03:26:15,734 --> 03:26:18,282
(laughter)

2537
03:26:18,282 --> 03:26:20,421
SAM: Floorboards! In her face!

2538
03:26:20,421 --> 03:26:24,277
TRAVIS: I thought you were on fire. I'm really
sorry.

2539
03:26:24,277 --> 03:26:35,264
MATT: Pike takes you over to the center of the
room and tells you. "Kneel with me. Now take this

2540
03:26:35,264 --> 03:26:44,401
"book and close your eyes and... apologize."

2541
03:26:44,401 --> 03:26:48,389
DARIN: For what?

2542
03:26:48,389 --> 03:26:52,217
MATT: "For everything you said about Ioun."

2543
03:26:52,217 --> 03:26:59,866
DARIN: (grumbles) All right. Well, look the other
way. Find some things that are of value.

2544
03:26:59,866 --> 03:27:02,179
TRAVIS: (whistles)

2545
03:27:02,179 --> 03:27:06,272
LAURA: Trinket sits down next to him and stares,
but I'll turn around.

2546
03:27:06,272 --> 03:27:19,588
DARIN: All right. I don't know if you're
listening, Ioun. It's been many years since I've

2547
03:27:19,588 --> 03:27:33,574
actually spoken to a god. I'd like to express my
deepest sorrow. You see, this home... didn't mean

2548
03:27:33,574 --> 03:27:46,035
as much to me as life. And I think these people
gave that to me. If you could give us... If you

2549
03:27:46,035 --> 03:27:54,830
could give me anything, any little hint, it would
be greatly appreciated and I would be a warrior in

2550
03:27:54,830 --> 03:28:04,687
your name forevermore. Please. Was that okay,
bear?

2551
03:28:04,687 --> 03:28:10,052
MATT: (huffs, licking) Licks the side of your
face.

2552
03:28:10,052 --> 03:28:12,289
DARIN: No, I'm not crying. You're crying, bear.

2553
03:28:12,289 --> 03:28:17,281
MATT: You sit there in silence with your eyes
closed, concentrating, holding the book before

2554
03:28:17,281 --> 03:28:32,601
you. Doesn't seem to be an answer. Just silence in
the darkness. Nothing. Everyone wants to

2555
03:28:32,601 --> 03:28:34,264
look at him-- still turned away?

2556
03:28:34,264 --> 03:28:38,312
MARISHA: Keyleth is definitely staring, but
pretending not to stare.

2557
03:28:38,312 --> 03:28:40,370
TALIESIN: I'm watching through the book.

2558
03:28:40,370 --> 03:28:43,506
LAURA: I'm leaning against the wall and staring at
him now.

2559
03:28:43,506 --> 03:28:54,957
MATT: Nothing. Nothing responds. As you have your
eyes closed, you hear this soft chuckle in the far

2560
03:28:54,957 --> 03:28:59,650
corner of the room. (cackles) "Really? Praying,
are you?"

2561
03:28:59,650 --> 03:29:03,477
DARIN: Yes. Can you help?

2562
03:29:03,477 --> 03:29:07,109
MATT: "Do I look the kind of guy that would
help?"

2563
03:29:07,109 --> 03:29:19,919
DARIN: Yes. I've known you for 19 years and I
think anybody's capable of anything, so why don't

2564
03:29:19,919 --> 03:29:23,038
you do something unexpected?

2565
03:29:23,038 --> 03:29:29,573
MATT: "I think you're right. It's no longer your
prison. It's not mine, either."

2566
03:29:29,573 --> 03:29:31,164
DARIN: That's true.

2567
03:29:31,164 --> 03:29:32,913
MATT: (flapping) Flies out the window.

2568
03:29:32,913 --> 03:29:35,093
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

2569
03:29:35,093 --> 03:29:40,507
DARIN: Kraghammer has another performer, and not a
very good one.

2570
03:29:40,507 --> 03:29:46,247
MATT: While you've been talking, by the way, and
the silence has been sad. Taking in the slight

2571
03:29:46,247 --> 03:29:50,679
emotional cut that not getting a response and
putting yourself on that limb means nothing. The

2572
03:29:50,679 --> 03:29:53,257
rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright
blue.

2573
03:29:53,257 --> 03:29:54,953
MARISHA: What? Is it really?

2574
03:29:54,953 --> 03:29:56,211
MATT: Yeah.

2575
03:29:56,211 --> 03:30:02,105
TRAVIS: Your stomach is glowing.

2576
03:30:02,105 --> 03:30:07,206
DARIN: Growing? What? I didn't eat anything. How
could my stomach be growing?

2577
03:30:07,206 --> 03:30:08,446
SAM: You're blue balling.

2578
03:30:08,446 --> 03:30:10,515
DARIN: What?

2579
03:30:10,515 --> 03:30:14,547
SAM: (whispering) Look down.

2580
03:30:14,547 --> 03:30:22,016
MATT: Pike looks at you and takes your hands and
opens your arms and motions to your chest. And the

2581
03:30:22,016 --> 03:30:28,828
book in your hand, you pull aside. You glance down
and you can see, there's this soft, bluish glow

2582
03:30:28,828 --> 03:30:32,299
that's emanating from your torso. Strange.

2583
03:30:32,299 --> 03:30:41,030
DARIN: You see? I didn't have to believe in Ioun.
I've found my religion. (chuckling) I'm Bluish!

2584
03:30:41,030 --> 03:30:44,508
(laughter)

2585
03:30:44,508 --> 03:30:46,295
TRAVIS: Aw, man!

2586
03:30:46,295 --> 03:30:47,718
DARIN: It didn't happen!

2587
03:30:47,718 --> 03:30:49,750
MATT: No, it did. That's canon.

2588
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:58,305
DARIN: Wait a second, gentlemen. We'll restart for
just a second. It'll be fine. That little imp is

2589
03:30:58,305 --> 03:31:06,723
gone. So apparently, the key... is me.

2590
03:31:06,723 --> 03:31:09,214
LAURA: Is you? It is you.

2591
03:31:09,214 --> 03:31:11,223
SAM: Is in you or is you?

2592
03:31:11,223 --> 03:31:16,402
MARISHA: It is him. I've known it from the minute
that I laid eyes upon him. It's him.

2593
03:31:16,402 --> 03:31:19,755
TRAVIS: You did? You knew that the moment you saw
him?

2594
03:31:19,755 --> 03:31:25,168
MARISHA: No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a
feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I

2595
03:31:25,168 --> 03:31:27,948
say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm
an asshole.

2596
03:31:27,948 --> 03:31:30,259
LIAM: To be fair, we've only been here 12
minutes.

2597
03:31:30,259 --> 03:31:37,568
DARIN: Yes. House gone. The imp gone. Burny,
burny. Sad, sad. Pray, nothing happened. Now I'm

2598
03:31:37,568 --> 03:31:41,105
blue. That's a day for you, isn't it?

2599
03:31:41,105 --> 03:31:46,111
LAURA: So do you glow brighter the closer we get?
What's the deal here?

2600
03:31:46,111 --> 03:31:48,607
DARIN: I've never glowed before, child.

2601
03:31:48,607 --> 03:31:50,031
LAURA: I think it's glown.

2602
03:31:50,031 --> 03:31:52,978
DARIN: I've never glowned.

2603
03:31:52,978 --> 03:31:57,044
SAM: If you're the key, where's the lock? Where do
we take you?

2604
03:31:57,044 --> 03:32:07,238
DARIN: Well, I have been gone for many, many years,
so English may have changed. To be fair. To be

2605
03:32:07,238 --> 03:32:13,961
fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would
have thought it would be in one of those tomes.

2606
03:32:13,961 --> 03:32:18,846
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up the book that he
was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just

2607
03:32:18,846 --> 03:32:20,282
try and read it.

2608
03:32:20,282 --> 03:32:28,739
MATT: Okay. You glance through it. The book is a
simple book, talking about the construction of

2609
03:32:28,739 --> 03:32:34,436
barricades and it looks like it was less 
the contents of the book and more just the image

2610
03:32:34,436 --> 03:32:35,934
of the book itself.

2611
03:32:35,934 --> 03:32:44,866
TALIESIN: I'm going to hand him the book again and
see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this

2612
03:32:44,866 --> 03:32:45,756
is--

2613
03:32:45,756 --> 03:32:51,108
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

2614
03:32:51,108 --> 03:33:00,202
TALIESIN: Oh, lord. Ooh. Let's call that a 28.

2615
03:33:00,202 --> 03:33:05,550
MATT: When you took the book from him and handed
him another book, there was a very faint vibration

2616
03:33:05,550 --> 03:33:11,287
to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it
back to him. Which you haven't noticed, but

2617
03:33:11,287 --> 03:33:13,822
there's a physical vibration to him.

2618
03:33:13,822 --> 03:33:17,408
TALIESIN: If it's all-- with your permission, I'm
going to take his hands.

2619
03:33:17,408 --> 03:33:21,797
MATT: Okay. You feel them, and you feel this very
faint vibration to his body.

2620
03:33:21,797 --> 03:33:25,257
MARISHA: Percy.

2621
03:33:25,257 --> 03:33:26,391
TALIESIN: Yes.

2622
03:33:26,391 --> 03:33:35,733
MARISHA: Continue holding his hands. I pull out
the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I

2623
03:33:35,733 --> 03:33:37,332
find the paper. Hold.

2624
03:33:37,332 --> 03:33:39,451
LAURA: What if he's a tuning fork?

2625
03:33:39,451 --> 03:33:41,097
MARISHA: (shushes)

2626
03:33:41,097 --> 03:33:42,504
DARIN: That's very rude.

2627
03:33:42,504 --> 03:33:44,553
MARISHA: Where is it? I have a lot of things.

2628
03:33:44,553 --> 03:33:45,743
SAM: Divining.

2629
03:33:45,743 --> 03:33:53,458
DARIN: Oh yes. A divining rod. A rod to the
divine. Perhaps I am a divining rod.

2630
03:33:53,458 --> 03:33:55,105
LAURA: That's what I mean.

2631
03:33:55,105 --> 03:33:56,741
DARIN: Well said, child!

2632
03:33:56,741 --> 03:34:02,317
MARISHA: I pull out the fork we that we got to get
to Elysium. Is it similar?

2633
03:34:02,317 --> 03:34:10,995
MATT: When you pull out the fork and you hold it,
you recall that whenever you cast the spell Plane

2634
03:34:10,995 --> 03:34:15,913
Shift, there was a faint vibration to the specific
fork when you cast the spell.

2635
03:34:15,913 --> 03:34:17,700
SAM and TALIESIN: He's the tuning fork.

2636
03:34:17,700 --> 03:34:18,951
MARISHA: Oh no.

2637
03:34:18,951 --> 03:34:20,435
LAURA: What, no? This is good!

2638
03:34:20,435 --> 03:34:33,532
MARISHA: No, it is good. It's good, it's just...
Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't

2639
03:34:33,532 --> 03:34:42,118
know. Everything in my life seems to have this
impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not

2640
03:34:42,118 --> 03:34:45,688
something that can be used and discarded.

2641
03:34:45,688 --> 03:34:50,909
DARIN: I haven't been used in 37 years.

2642
03:34:50,909 --> 03:34:52,163
MARISHA: Sprigg.

2643
03:34:52,163 --> 03:34:57,833
DARIN: It's all right. At least I wasn't discarded
all that time.

2644
03:34:57,833 --> 03:35:01,029
MARISHA: I'm sure it's fine, I just--

2645
03:35:01,029 --> 03:35:13,992
DARIN: Look. Look at me. Just remember. Whatever
happens, remember me. That's all that's

2646
03:35:13,992 --> 03:35:15,293
important.

2647
03:35:15,293 --> 03:35:19,752
LIAM: That's good advice.

2648
03:35:19,752 --> 03:35:29,224
DARIN: That's all that we have. My friends are
gone and I don't even remember their names. I

2649
03:35:29,224 --> 03:35:37,358
don't remember Thetapax or Zephyr or... the guy
with the nose. He was my favorite.

2650
03:35:37,358 --> 03:35:45,303
(coughs and sniffles) Dusty in here, isn't it?

2651
03:35:45,303 --> 03:35:46,950
MARISHA: Oh, Sprigg.

2652
03:35:46,950 --> 03:36:01,771
DARIN: (sniffles and coughs) I remember. (softer)
I remember. See? It's all up here. So whatever

2653
03:36:01,771 --> 03:36:08,258
happens, keep me there. All right?

2654
03:36:08,258 --> 03:36:19,015
MARISHA: I guess I have to start getting used to
losing things.

2655
03:36:19,015 --> 03:36:29,160
DARIN: Yes. Or you can be hidden away in a prison
for 37 years. And that's not life, child. That's

2656
03:36:29,160 --> 03:36:32,130
hiding. Don't hide.

2657
03:36:32,130 --> 03:36:37,527
MARISHA: I've already built my own prison. They
don't know. I'm already there.

2658
03:36:37,527 --> 03:36:49,276
DARIN: You can break out. You can. It's hard. But
you can do it. Just take the first step. And then

2659
03:36:49,276 --> 03:36:52,903
you take another one. And then you take another
one.

2660
03:36:52,903 --> 03:37:00,593
MARISHA: And I grab his hand, and with that, I
cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go.

2661
03:37:00,593 --> 03:37:03,712
MATT: All right. The rest of you gathered hands
for this?

2662
03:37:03,712 --> 03:37:04,789
LAURA: I guess so.

2663
03:37:04,789 --> 03:37:06,768
MATT: All right.

2664
03:37:06,768 --> 03:37:10,842
LAURA: Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the
necklace. Quick!

2665
03:37:10,842 --> 03:37:12,536
MATT: Trinket. (roars) Into the necklace.

2666
03:37:12,536 --> 03:37:15,162
DARIN: Wait. My invisible frog companion.

2667
03:37:15,162 --> 03:37:17,005
SAM: Is he real?

2668
03:37:17,005 --> 03:37:18,848
DARIN: Yes.

2669
03:37:18,848 --> 03:37:20,691
(laughter)

2670
03:37:20,691 --> 03:37:27,039
MATT: There is a sudden (sucking noise). A
shuddering of power energy around you as you feel

2671
03:37:27,039 --> 03:37:31,709
the vibration out of Sprigg's hand emanate
throughout the entire loop you guys have created

2672
03:37:31,709 --> 03:37:37,689
throughout your grasp. The familiar bright light
flashes before you, and you feel your body being

2673
03:37:37,689 --> 03:37:44,180
pulled through, at incredible speeds, through
darkness. There. The familiar racing of the divine

2674
03:37:44,180 --> 03:37:55,569
gate. (fast travel noise) As you pass through one
of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now

2675
03:37:55,569 --> 03:37:59,342
you've-- the times you've passed through the gate,
you've passed through it a handful of times since

2676
03:37:59,342 --> 03:38:07,480
now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's
beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance

2677
03:38:07,480 --> 03:38:17,266
around and see each other. Did you miss your
destination? Did you overshoot? What's next?

2678
03:38:17,266 --> 03:38:29,990
(whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're
at a destination. You glance around and you're

2679
03:38:29,990 --> 03:38:35,844
standing within a small chamber. It resembles a
decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants.

2680
03:38:35,844 --> 03:38:41,787
It's empty. There are marble pillars stretching to
a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all.

2681
03:38:41,787 --> 03:38:48,748
Silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles
throughout the ceiling. Glowing points of magical

2682
03:38:48,748 --> 03:38:54,327
light latched within iron cages dangle at the
edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give

2683
03:38:54,327 --> 03:39:00,885
the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room.
There are walls on each side of this chamber,

2684
03:39:00,885 --> 03:39:09,384
about 30 or 40 feet from you, and one arched
hallway across from you that leads to the only

2685
03:39:09,384 --> 03:39:11,990
other chamber you've seen.

2686
03:39:11,990 --> 03:39:17,927
MARISHA: I immediately turn and look to see if
Sprigg is still holding my hand.

2687
03:39:17,927 --> 03:39:20,928
MATT: Sprigg is still holding your hand.

2688
03:39:20,928 --> 03:39:24,008
LAURA: See? All that fucking shit was for nothing!
He's still alive!

2689
03:39:24,008 --> 03:39:28,220
SAM: Are you the same Sprigg as before?

2690
03:39:28,220 --> 03:39:40,628
DARIN: I hope so. Let's ask my invisible frog
companion. Well, I guess we'd better go find what we

2691
03:39:40,628 --> 03:39:45,302
are looking for.

2692
03:39:45,302 --> 03:39:52,290
MARISHA: Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg.

2693
03:39:52,290 --> 03:39:55,361
DARIN: It's good to be alive.

2694
03:39:55,361 --> 03:39:56,969
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

2695
03:39:56,969 --> 03:39:58,941
DARIN: Remember that.

2696
03:39:58,941 --> 03:40:02,959
MARISHA: Okay. I will.

2697
03:40:02,959 --> 03:40:10,750
MATT: As you guys walk forward towards the
singular hallway, you go through the domed arch,

2698
03:40:10,750 --> 03:40:22,775
and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth
grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to

2699
03:40:22,775 --> 03:40:29,746
have carved out whatever this material was. It
extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though

2700
03:40:29,746 --> 03:40:38,609
there's very very faint light, and many of you can
see through darkvision, there is a darkness about

2701
03:40:38,609 --> 03:40:43,103
60 feet from you that seems to consume what you
can see. You can only see so far beyond that

2702
03:40:43,103 --> 03:40:50,597
radius, and you're not quite sure where that
oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is

2703
03:40:50,597 --> 03:40:57,408
chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear
the distant sound of pinched winds whining through

2704
03:40:57,408 --> 03:41:03,379
small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times
you've spent underground, through caverns that had

2705
03:41:03,379 --> 03:41:09,376
some openings that allowed air to streak through
to the surface.

2706
03:41:09,376 --> 03:41:24,142
A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens
into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could

2707
03:41:24,142 --> 03:41:32,150
even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward
for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering

2708
03:41:32,150 --> 03:41:40,043
lights fell from your vision. You do not see where
they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases

2709
03:41:40,043 --> 03:41:49,536
and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets
and any form of recorded information seem to just

2710
03:41:49,536 --> 03:41:57,596
be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this
road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost

2711
03:41:57,596 --> 03:42:01,142
every direction, the walls to the side of you. You
see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind

2712
03:42:01,142 --> 03:42:10,196
and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no
end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up

2713
03:42:10,196 --> 03:42:15,552
you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend
around each other.

2714
03:42:15,552 --> 03:42:22,614
Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond
mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind

2715
03:42:22,614 --> 03:42:29,254
gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the
library, though sparse as they may be from this

2716
03:42:29,254 --> 03:42:37,438
entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from
whatever words are within. You begin to almost get

2717
03:42:37,438 --> 03:42:41,602
vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and
overwhelming construction of such a wondrous

2718
03:42:41,602 --> 03:42:47,721
place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral
custodians keeping the tales of each other and the

2719
03:42:47,721 --> 03:42:54,488
history of Exandria past, present, and binding the
pages to tell what will eventually be the present,

2720
03:42:54,488 --> 03:42:55,955
currently the future.

2721
03:42:55,955 --> 03:43:01,207
TALIESIN: I've dreamed of this place.

2722
03:43:01,207 --> 03:43:05,271
LIAM: Inside Matt's brain?

2723
03:43:05,271 --> 03:43:29,398
TALIESIN: This is immortality. This is everything.
(sighs, chuckles) I may never leave. I glide over

2724
03:43:29,398 --> 03:43:40,150
to Vex and hold her close. This is stunning. My
god, I think they may have actually forgotten all

2725
03:43:40,150 --> 03:43:42,596
the idiot things I said yesterday.

2726
03:43:42,596 --> 03:43:45,812
LAURA: Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

2727
03:43:45,812 --> 03:43:51,713
TALIESIN: I think they've completely forgotten.
I'm sorry. May have panicked.

2728
03:43:51,713 --> 03:43:53,550
LAURA: I give him a kiss.

2729
03:43:53,550 --> 03:44:01,436
TALIESIN: I'll be right back. I'm going to run
towards one of those stacks, like a child.

2730
03:44:01,436 --> 03:44:06,959
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the first--

2731
03:44:06,959 --> 03:44:13,422
TALIESIN: I'm doing a title run. I want to figure
out the organizational system before I touch a

2732
03:44:13,422 --> 03:44:14,378
book.

2733
03:44:14,378 --> 03:44:18,167
MATT: There are no words on any of the spines.

2734
03:44:18,167 --> 03:44:20,476
TALIESIN: I pick one.

2735
03:44:20,476 --> 03:44:22,751
MATT: Okay. You pick.

2736
03:44:22,751 --> 03:44:31,514
TALIESIN: All right. I pick it up. I look around
to see if anybody has a problem. And I turn to the

2737
03:44:31,514 --> 03:44:32,961
title page.

2738
03:44:32,961 --> 03:44:35,076
MATT: It's ironic you do this, because the book is
in Celestial.

2739
03:44:35,076 --> 03:44:37,233
TALIESIN: I read Celestial.

2740
03:44:37,233 --> 03:44:44,958
MATT: You do. It's ironic that you did that.
(chuckles) Glancing through, it appears to be

2741
03:44:44,958 --> 03:44:54,374
describing a birth. Describing a tunnel, then a
light, then a cry.

2742
03:44:54,374 --> 03:44:59,238
TALIESIN: I skip to the end. Last page.

2743
03:44:59,238 --> 03:45:04,068
MATT: It seems to be an older man, surrounded by
his family--

2744
03:45:04,068 --> 03:45:08,763
TALIESIN: I've got it. I put it down. I pick up
another one.

2745
03:45:08,763 --> 03:45:11,765
MATT: You glance through this book.

2746
03:45:11,765 --> 03:45:12,989
TALIESIN: First page.

2747
03:45:12,989 --> 03:45:14,668
MATT: Begins very similarly to the last one.

2748
03:45:14,668 --> 03:45:15,801
TALIESIN: Last page.

2749
03:45:15,801 --> 03:45:20,930
MATT: This one actually ends with what appears to
be a horseback riding accident.

2750
03:45:20,930 --> 03:45:22,457
MARISHA: Oh god, they're souls.

2751
03:45:22,457 --> 03:45:24,021
TALIESIN: 115 pages in.

2752
03:45:24,021 --> 03:45:31,680
MATT: 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to
talk about the sorrow of a lost romance, and

2753
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:34,378
trying to deal, coping at a young adult age.

2754
03:45:34,378 --> 03:45:37,733
TALIESIN: I put it back and I turn. They're made
of people.

2755
03:45:37,733 --> 03:45:39,973
LAURA: Wait, what? It's skin books?

2756
03:45:39,973 --> 03:45:48,398
TALIESIN: It's people! And I'm going to find the
most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to

2757
03:45:48,398 --> 03:45:50,744
the first. Birth. Death.

2758
03:45:50,744 --> 03:45:52,246
LAURA: I can't read that, dear.

2759
03:45:52,246 --> 03:46:04,549
TALIESIN: Birth! Death! Sex. Birth, death, some
disappointment. I am just gone. I'm running back

2760
03:46:04,549 --> 03:46:08,565
and forth, finding whatever interesting spine I
can. Are they all in Celestial?

2761
03:46:08,565 --> 03:46:11,895
MATT: They are currently. All the ones you've
picked up are in Celestial.

2762
03:46:11,895 --> 03:46:17,887
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Okay. This is great. All
right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out

2763
03:46:17,887 --> 03:46:20,197
from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down.

2764
03:46:20,197 --> 03:46:25,079
LAURA: We should maybe find Ioun, don't you
think?

2765
03:46:25,079 --> 03:46:39,918
TALIESIN: If we must, yes. Just as an experiment,
I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch

2766
03:46:39,918 --> 03:46:45,896
a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going
to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up

2767
03:46:45,896 --> 03:46:47,639
and flip through it.

2768
03:46:47,639 --> 03:46:56,756
MATT: Make a religion check.

2769
03:46:56,756 --> 03:46:58,142
TALIESIN: Nope.

2770
03:46:58,142 --> 03:47:02,699
MATT: You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as
you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar

2771
03:47:02,699 --> 03:47:03,638
one.

2772
03:47:03,638 --> 03:47:10,673
TALIESIN: There's a system. I will discover the
system. I'm going to keep running around like a

2773
03:47:10,673 --> 03:47:11,926
kid.

2774
03:47:11,926 --> 03:47:14,378
MATT: What are the rest of you guys doing while
Percival is running around like a kid?

2775
03:47:14,378 --> 03:47:16,618
TRAVIS: I'm not interested in the fucking books.

2776
03:47:16,618 --> 03:47:22,987
MARISHA: Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans.
Does anything in Primordial stick out?

2777
03:47:22,987 --> 03:47:26,404
MATT: Make a perception check.

2778
03:47:26,404 --> 03:47:34,812
MARISHA: That's good. 29.

2779
03:47:34,812 --> 03:47:39,712
MATT: Glancing about, none of the spines have
anything written on them, so you have to start

2780
03:47:39,712 --> 03:47:41,342
pulling a few books out and opening them.

2781
03:47:41,342 --> 03:47:46,358
MARISHA: I hold my hand over and pull.

2782
03:47:46,358 --> 03:47:51,823
MATT: You open it up. It's not in a language you
understand.

2783
03:47:51,823 --> 03:47:55,442
MARISHA: I put it back and get frustrated.

2784
03:47:55,442 --> 03:48:00,568
TALIESIN: I've stopped. I'm good.

2785
03:48:00,568 --> 03:48:07,204
LIAM: Watched her the whole time and quietly walk
up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't

2786
03:48:07,204 --> 03:48:08,712
say anything.

2787
03:48:08,712 --> 03:48:12,279
SAM: Are there any doors leading forward or back?

2788
03:48:12,279 --> 03:48:17,977
MATT: It's a labyrinth of bookshelves. There's a
path forward between, two or three ahead of you,

2789
03:48:17,977 --> 03:48:23,274
but then it comes to an end where it splits off in
two directions. Like I said, they travel up

2790
03:48:23,274 --> 03:48:26,776
infinitely, so you're not quite sure which way
leads where.

2791
03:48:26,776 --> 03:48:28,384
LAURA: Is Sprigg still glowing?

2792
03:48:28,384 --> 03:48:33,811
MATT: Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint
blue glow in him that never really faded since

2793
03:48:33,811 --> 03:48:34,884
your arrival.

2794
03:48:34,884 --> 03:48:39,733
LAURA: I wonder if we could follow the glow.
Warmer?

2795
03:48:39,733 --> 03:48:42,624
MARISHA: Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there!

2796
03:48:42,624 --> 03:48:47,758
DARIN: All right. I run to where she's pointing.
Is there any change in the glow?

2797
03:48:47,758 --> 03:48:49,082
MATT: No noticeable change.

2798
03:48:49,082 --> 03:48:50,784
MARISHA: Damn. Sprigg, stand over there!

2799
03:48:50,784 --> 03:48:57,251
DARIN: I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so
give me a second. I run over there, stop halfway

2800
03:48:57,251 --> 03:49:02,793
and go, ow, and then I continue. When I get there,
any change in the glow?

2801
03:49:02,793 --> 03:49:04,519
MATT: Make a perception check.

2802
03:49:04,519 --> 03:49:08,800
DARIN: Oh, it's a one.

2803
03:49:08,800 --> 03:49:11,735
MATT: No discernible difference.

2804
03:49:11,735 --> 03:49:14,196
SAM: You're inspired, if you want to use
inspiration.

2805
03:49:14,196 --> 03:49:15,974
MATT: It's a natural one. It's an auto-fail.

2806
03:49:15,974 --> 03:49:20,564
TALIESIN: Is there a card catalog?

2807
03:49:20,564 --> 03:49:23,807
SAM: Is there a central area info desk?

2808
03:49:23,807 --> 03:49:28,253
MATT: You can make an investigation check to begin
to wander around and try to find your way.

2809
03:49:28,253 --> 03:49:30,721
SAM: Oh, that's a natural 20.

2810
03:49:30,721 --> 03:49:36,749
MATT: Scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one
of the random rows.

2811
03:49:36,749 --> 03:49:39,329
SAM: I'm clutching my Ioun stone.

2812
03:49:39,329 --> 03:49:45,477
MATT: Okay. All right. Anyone else do anything?

2813
03:49:45,477 --> 03:49:49,703
TALIESIN: He seems to have purpose. I'm giddily
following behind.

2814
03:49:49,703 --> 03:49:51,529
MATT: Okay, Percy's following Scanlan.

2815
03:49:51,529 --> 03:49:53,640
LAURA: I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and
Trinket's out.

2816
03:49:53,640 --> 03:49:58,216
MATT: Okay. Trinket (bear grunt) looks confused
and starts looking up.

2817
03:49:58,216 --> 03:50:00,365
LAURA: I know. I know, dear.

2818
03:50:00,365 --> 03:50:01,845
MATT: Falls onto his back.

2819
03:50:01,845 --> 03:50:04,420
SAM: Are Vex and Percy walking with me?

2820
03:50:04,420 --> 03:50:05,473
MATT: Yes, they are.

2821
03:50:05,473 --> 03:50:11,224
SAM: I'm going to whip out my flute and I start
going, (wedding march).

2822
03:50:11,224 --> 03:50:14,304
TALIESIN: Oh. He may have heard.

2823
03:50:14,304 --> 03:50:19,049
LAURA: He heard?

2824
03:50:19,049 --> 03:50:21,234
TALIESIN: I thought you were going to die! I may
have panicked.

2825
03:50:21,234 --> 03:50:22,507
LAURA: Wait.

2826
03:50:22,507 --> 03:50:27,562
TALIESIN: We were asked to plead for your life,
and I may have panicked.

2827
03:50:27,562 --> 03:50:34,149
LAURA: Who did you tell? Percival, who did you
tell?

2828
03:50:34,149 --> 03:50:35,699
SAM: Look at your shirt.

2829
03:50:35,699 --> 03:50:40,692
LAURA: What? (screams) No!

2830
03:50:40,692 --> 03:50:42,697
TALIESIN: I panicked!

2831
03:50:42,697 --> 03:50:43,709
LAURA: Percy!

2832
03:50:43,709 --> 03:50:49,471
TALIESIN: I panicked! There was a giant glowing
sun, and I may have panicked. Well, I was a bit

2833
03:50:49,471 --> 03:50:50,891
vague, but I was--

2834
03:50:50,891 --> 03:50:53,948
LAURA: A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say?

2835
03:50:53,948 --> 03:50:55,541
SAM: Well.

2836
03:50:55,541 --> 03:50:56,860
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2837
03:50:56,860 --> 03:51:01,356
SAM: First comes love. Then comes marriage.

2838
03:51:01,356 --> 03:51:04,987
TALIESIN: I may have hinted that we might have
eloped. May have hinted.

2839
03:51:04,987 --> 03:51:07,124
SAM: Wait, you're married?

2840
03:51:07,124 --> 03:51:09,358
TALIESIN: I may have hinted.

2841
03:51:09,358 --> 03:51:14,601
SAM: Wait, no, you said you were betrothed to be
married? Wait, you're married? Oh, wow, you just

2842
03:51:14,601 --> 03:51:15,582
spilled it!

2843
03:51:15,582 --> 03:51:17,048
TALIESIN: Silence! Cone of Silence!

2844
03:51:17,048 --> 03:51:18,937
SAM: They're married!

2845
03:51:18,937 --> 03:51:24,786
MATT: You try and yell, and it's making no sound.
It is just absolute quiet. What are the rest of

2846
03:51:24,786 --> 03:51:25,893
you guys doing?

2847
03:51:25,893 --> 03:51:28,077
DARIN: I run in the corner and see if I glow
again.

2848
03:51:28,077 --> 03:51:32,980
LIAM: Keyleth and Vax heard the (wedding march),
so we had a very different silent scene over in

2849
03:51:32,980 --> 03:51:34,329
our spot.

2850
03:51:34,329 --> 03:51:40,047
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in
Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went

2851
03:51:40,047 --> 03:51:41,490
(angry roar).

2852
03:51:41,490 --> 03:51:46,680
LAURA: Why is that bad? Why was that angry?

2853
03:51:46,680 --> 03:51:48,643
LIAM: Because we don't get that.

2854
03:51:48,643 --> 03:51:49,917
LAURA: Oh.

2855
03:51:49,917 --> 03:51:51,416
MATT: Grog?

2856
03:51:51,416 --> 03:51:55,861
SAM: So you're going to ruin everyone else's joy.
You're one of those couples.

2857
03:51:55,861 --> 03:52:02,208
LIAM: Thank you, vacation Scanlan.

2858
03:52:02,208 --> 03:52:06,051
MARISHA: Worst double date sangria partners ever.

2859
03:52:06,051 --> 03:52:09,882
TALIESIN: He's back, ladies and gentlemen. He's
back and taking no prisoners.

2860
03:52:09,882 --> 03:52:13,816
SAM: Are you guys going on vacation? We got a
divorce.

2861
03:52:13,816 --> 03:52:17,524
LIAM: It's the Debbie Downer SNL sketch.

2862
03:52:17,524 --> 03:52:21,631
MATT: Grog, what are you doing?

2863
03:52:21,631 --> 03:52:28,985
TRAVIS: I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be.
This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life.

2864
03:52:28,985 --> 03:52:33,613
I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon.

2865
03:52:33,613 --> 03:52:35,685
TALIESIN: I love that.

2866
03:52:35,685 --> 03:52:42,246
TRAVIS: It's just endless books, beyond what you
can see! Are there chairs?

2867
03:52:42,246 --> 03:52:44,720
LAURA: I feel like Pike would've comforted him.

2868
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:46,109
MATT: Yeah, Pike comes over.

2869
03:52:46,109 --> 03:52:47,185
TRAVIS: There are chairs?

2870
03:52:47,185 --> 03:52:50,507
MATT: No, there aren't. She goes, "Do you want to
go with everyone else, Grog?"

2871
03:52:50,507 --> 03:52:53,060
TRAVIS: I don't know. Do you?

2872
03:52:53,060 --> 03:52:54,729
MATT: "It's okay, yeah! They're walking."

2873
03:52:54,729 --> 03:52:57,870
TRAVIS: I want to leave. Fast.

2874
03:52:57,870 --> 03:53:01,480
MATT: "The faster we follow them, then the faster
we can go."

2875
03:53:01,480 --> 03:53:03,814
TRAVIS: Okay. Let's go.

2876
03:53:03,814 --> 03:53:05,503
MATT: "I bet you could read some of these books."

2877
03:53:05,503 --> 03:53:08,366
TRAVIS: I bet not. These are really tall books.

2878
03:53:08,366 --> 03:53:15,096
MATT: "Come on." She grabs your hand and begins
tugging you behind her. What are you guys doing?

2879
03:53:15,096 --> 03:53:17,170
MARISHA: Me and him?

2880
03:53:17,170 --> 03:53:18,102
MATT: Yeah.

2881
03:53:18,102 --> 03:53:19,747
LIAM: Leaning into each other.

2882
03:53:19,747 --> 03:53:21,176
MATT: Okay. So you guys stay there.

2883
03:53:21,176 --> 03:53:25,182
DARIN: I'm trying to see if I'm glowing anywhere.

2884
03:53:25,182 --> 03:53:28,126
MATT: You run around for a good minute and a half
and you're not seeing any sort of change.

2885
03:53:28,126 --> 03:53:28,901
DARIN: Nothing?

2886
03:53:28,901 --> 03:53:29,827
MATT: No.

2887
03:53:29,827 --> 03:53:35,450
DARIN: Can I go forward into the bookcases and
look right and left to see where they lead?

2888
03:53:35,450 --> 03:53:38,401
MATT: Okay, yeah. You turn around the corner and
see them disappear around the edge.

2889
03:53:38,401 --> 03:53:41,802
DARIN: I'll continue.

2890
03:53:41,802 --> 03:53:47,027
MATT: Okay. So you follow them. As you guys are
having this silent argument, Sprigg catches up to

2891
03:53:47,027 --> 03:53:51,894
you, but you hear nothing, Sprigg, as they're all
going...

2892
03:53:51,894 --> 03:53:54,059
TALIESIN: I just turned it off. I got everyone to
agree.

2893
03:53:54,059 --> 03:53:55,089
MATT: Okay.

2894
03:53:55,089 --> 03:53:58,397
LAURA: Hi. How's it going?

2895
03:53:58,397 --> 03:54:05,511
DARIN: Glowing. You are, too! What's going on with
that? Yeah, you seem to be blushing.

2896
03:54:05,511 --> 03:54:09,203
LAURA: It's so hot in here. It's very hot in
here.

2897
03:54:09,203 --> 03:54:12,274
MATT: Pike and Grog catch up around the corner.

2898
03:54:12,274 --> 03:54:17,634
TRAVIS: What did you find? The way out? Exit?

2899
03:54:17,634 --> 03:54:24,687
SAM: Seems like it could be this way. We'll have
to band together and go forward.

2900
03:54:24,687 --> 03:54:26,764
TRAVIS: Really?

2901
03:54:26,764 --> 03:54:27,718
SAM: Yes.

2902
03:54:27,718 --> 03:54:29,532
TALIESIN: Where did you get the sunglasses from?

2903
03:54:29,532 --> 03:54:31,621
SAM: It's glowing in here.

2904
03:54:31,621 --> 03:54:35,048
MATT: The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint
glow similar to the glow that you see emanating

2905
03:54:35,048 --> 03:54:36,499
from Sprigg's torso.

2906
03:54:36,499 --> 03:54:38,836
SAM: Is it glowing any more than--

2907
03:54:38,836 --> 03:54:40,160
MATT: Make a perception check.

2908
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:50,081
SAM: Oh, okay. That's an eight. Maybe 11, I don't
know. Do I add Jack of All Trades?

2909
03:54:50,081 --> 03:54:51,762
MATT: You do, yeah. If you're not--

2910
03:54:51,762 --> 03:55:03,437
SAM: I really want to know. I will inspire myself,
and I'll add a d12. That makes it 16.

2911
03:55:03,437 --> 03:55:09,409
MATT: Okay. You start getting the sense, the
further you walk, both your stone and Sprigg are

2912
03:55:09,409 --> 03:55:15,132
beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow, and
so you guys begin to realize that this could be

2913
03:55:15,132 --> 03:55:17,399
used as a path to something. You're not quite
sure.

2914
03:55:17,399 --> 03:55:19,915
SAM: Let's keep going.

2915
03:55:19,915 --> 03:55:21,780
MATT: Okay. So everyone's going behind.

2916
03:55:21,780 --> 03:55:29,190
LIAM: Imagination clarification, because a Silence
effect went off there. Did Vax and Keyleth hear,

2917
03:55:29,190 --> 03:55:32,328
"You're married?" Or was that all covered by
Silence?

2918
03:55:32,328 --> 03:55:33,610
MATT: No, he crushed that in Silence.

2919
03:55:33,610 --> 03:55:35,755
LIAM: So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to
know.

2920
03:55:35,755 --> 03:55:40,725
MATT: Everyone else has gone ahead and vanished
into the library. You guys are staying?

2921
03:55:40,725 --> 03:55:49,072
LIAM: Noticing that we're totally alone, silently
tug Keyleth down after them.

2922
03:55:49,072 --> 03:55:51,718
TALIESIN: I felt that honesty was important at
that moment.

2923
03:55:51,718 --> 03:55:57,130
LAURA: No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm
just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke

2924
03:55:57,130 --> 03:55:58,363
with him.

2925
03:55:58,363 --> 03:56:02,669
SAM: He was acting nobly. I won't tell anyone if
you don't want me to.

2926
03:56:02,669 --> 03:56:07,056
TALIESIN: We had to tell them eventually.

2927
03:56:07,056 --> 03:56:12,715
MATT: As you're following the stone, you hear some
footfalls as Vax and Keyleth catch up to you

2928
03:56:12,715 --> 03:56:13,783
guys.

2929
03:56:13,783 --> 03:56:17,103
MARISHA: We already know. It's fine.

2930
03:56:17,103 --> 03:56:19,556
LIAM: You're engaged. You don't have to--

2931
03:56:19,556 --> 03:56:21,185
TALIESIN: Well.

2932
03:56:21,185 --> 03:56:33,753
LAURA: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that.
Engagement. But you know.

2933
03:56:33,753 --> 03:56:38,501
MARISHA: You fucking liars. You fucking liars!
Just tell us! We know!

2934
03:56:38,501 --> 03:56:44,766
LAURA: We got married.

2935
03:56:44,766 --> 03:56:46,526
TALIESIN: We may have gotten married.

2936
03:56:46,526 --> 03:56:48,989
MARISHA: Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise!

2937
03:56:48,989 --> 03:56:53,475
TALIESIN: It was going to be--

2938
03:56:53,475 --> 03:56:55,095
LAURA: (weakly) Celebration!

2939
03:56:55,095 --> 03:57:00,662
TALIESIN: We didn't want to make it a thing. We
wanted it to just be--

2940
03:57:00,662 --> 03:57:02,984
SAM: I think it's great.

2941
03:57:02,984 --> 03:57:04,550
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan.

2942
03:57:04,550 --> 03:57:11,160
SAM: It's wonderful when two people can fall in
love and have each other forever and ever. That's

2943
03:57:11,160 --> 03:57:18,743
nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're
super cute together. You'll make Whitestone--

2944
03:57:18,743 --> 03:57:21,526
You'll be celebrities there.

2945
03:57:21,526 --> 03:57:24,073
TRAVIS: Do we have to get you gifts?

2946
03:57:24,073 --> 03:57:26,905
SAM: No, they eloped, so we're clear.

2947
03:57:26,905 --> 03:57:30,558
TALIESIN: Very specifically, no. This place.

2948
03:57:30,558 --> 03:57:38,087
MARISHA: Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up
her flame hands as she walks off in a fury.

2949
03:57:38,087 --> 03:57:47,832
TALIESIN: Do you not know what this place means?
Am I the only one who understands what this place

2950
03:57:47,832 --> 03:57:48,791
means?

2951
03:57:48,791 --> 03:57:50,107
TRAVIS: I would love to know.

2952
03:57:50,107 --> 03:57:51,570
TALIESIN: It all matters!

2953
03:57:51,570 --> 03:57:52,883
LAURA: None of us have forgotten.

2954
03:57:52,883 --> 03:58:03,793
TALIESIN: No, I mean, really! It all matters! So much, and
it's not going to go away! Nothing goes away!

2955
03:58:03,793 --> 03:58:12,392
MARISHA: No, it only gets filed away in some
library where no one else can experience it except

2956
03:58:12,392 --> 03:58:15,207
for, what, one, maybe two people ever.

2957
03:58:15,207 --> 03:58:18,569
TALIESIN: One and two people are all that it takes
to experience something!

2958
03:58:18,569 --> 03:58:28,483
MATT: An echoing voice billows out from the right
side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice

2959
03:58:28,483 --> 03:58:36,469
that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the
intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is

2960
03:58:36,469 --> 03:58:44,654
"forever, Percival." You glance off to the right,
and you can see there's a break in the bookcase.

2961
03:58:44,654 --> 03:58:55,887
To your right, you see the shelves have stopped
ahead in this direction to reveal a circular

2962
03:58:55,887 --> 03:59:07,494
common area within the library, where the ground
domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of

2963
03:59:07,494 --> 03:59:16,471
cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles
alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity

2964
03:59:16,471 --> 03:59:26,104
seems to shift depending on where the dome stands.
These tables hold teacups and writing implements

2965
03:59:26,104 --> 03:59:36,044
and various other décor, and things that involve
binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of

2966
03:59:36,044 --> 03:59:44,958
them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes
to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of

2967
03:59:44,958 --> 03:59:49,792
silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the
supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and

2968
03:59:49,792 --> 03:59:56,598
they come down like drifting silks that push past
as you enter the area.

2969
03:59:56,598 --> 04:00:07,502
Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the
dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older

2970
04:00:07,502 --> 04:00:17,734
woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is
somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond

2971
04:00:17,734 --> 04:00:28,093
eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant
purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her

2972
04:00:28,093 --> 04:00:31,967
blue and white robes tumble out from her form in
tendrils of parchment that snake through the

2973
04:00:31,967 --> 04:00:46,452
pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see
her. "I felt that you would find me."

2974
04:00:46,452 --> 04:00:48,931
And that's where we'll end tonight's session.

2975
04:00:48,931 --> 04:00:56,081
SAM: Wow, Matt. Wow, Darin!

2976
04:00:56,081 --> 04:01:01,516
LIAM: Can everybody watching still at home give a
round of applause for Darin?

2977
04:01:01,516 --> 04:01:10,258
MATT: Seriously. If you're available, you may want
to, if you can, come and join us for the first

2978
04:01:10,258 --> 04:01:14,466
half maybe. Not next week, but the week after
Comic Con, if you're interested. Because I want to

2979
04:01:14,466 --> 04:01:17,152
roleplay out you meeting Ioun.

2980
04:01:17,152 --> 04:01:22,200
DARIN: It would be an honor. You know how
important this is to me.

2981
04:01:22,200 --> 04:01:24,845
MATT: Great. I'll look forward to having you back
in a couple weeks, then.

2982
04:01:24,845 --> 04:01:28,028
DARIN: And I will see you next weekend, as well!

2983
04:01:28,028 --> 04:01:36,194
MATT: Yes, indeed. Oh, Comic Con. Guys, thank you
so much. Great game, well done. Breaking stuff,

2984
04:01:36,194 --> 04:01:41,018
apparently. Once again, we have no episode next
week because we'll be at Comic Con, but we have

2985
04:01:41,018 --> 04:01:48,829
our panel on Saturday for Critical Role. Love you
guys, hope you have a wonderful night, and is it

2986
04:01:48,829 --> 04:01:51,328
Thursday yet? Good night!

2987
04:01:51,328 --> 04:08:19,721
