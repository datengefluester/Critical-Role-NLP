1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,636
LIAM: Hello there! And welcome to an episode of
Critical Role!

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:04,954
(cheering)

3
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:10,749
LIAM: Where a bunch of us-- man, that was good,
that was like a wall of sound and every note of it

4
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:16,470
was foul and disgusting. Welcome to the show where
a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,500
and play Dungeons and Dragons.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,117
(cheering)

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:26,049
LIAM: Yeah, things don't look like they
normally do-- for us either, Matt's over there!

8
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,999
He's sitting right there!

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,500
MATT: It's very weird from this perspective.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,001
LIAM: You look so little, over there.

11
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:31,964
MATT: Yeah!

12
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:32,806
LIAM: Yeah?

13
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,485
MATT: You look about the same size to me.

14
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:40,454
LIAM: Oh. Well, we have a shit-ton of
announcements. I'm really excited to be a

15
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:47,263
jackass. So let's get through them! First of all,
thank you everybody for the survey. 44,700 of you

16
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:52,382
answered, and we can't thank you enough. Yeah.
We're hoping to have something fun for you guys

17
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:55,893
soon because of it, so really, thank you for
taking the time to do it. And we will take that

18
00:00:55,893 --> 00:01:01,577
data, and I will eat it. Merch! I'm going to throw
it to Laura, because that's what you do, you throw

19
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,249
merch to Laura.

20
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:08,944
LAURA: (muffled) Hi. I'm eating a piece of pizza.
We have merch in the store. We're all out of dice,

21
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:15,779
but yo, we've got the t-shirts, we got some hats,
we got patches and vinyl stickers. We got all

22
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,164
sorts of shit.

23
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,656
TRAVIS: See, our store go hard.

24
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:20,137
LAURA: Go to the store!

25
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,459
LIAM: Pop some tags.

26
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:26,073
LAURA: I know it's 4/20, the store kind of looks
like a weed dispensary. But it's not. It's a

27
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:27,903
straight-up Geek and Sundry store.

28
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,159
TRAVIS: We should look into Critical Role
cannabis.

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,890
SAM: Oh, that'd be so good.

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,408
MARISHA: Weed and Sundry.

31
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:34,894
LAURA: Oh! That's good.

32
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,256
ASHLEY: That'd be pretty tight.

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,413
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

34
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,113
TRAVIS: We're getting fired.

35
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:42,394
MARISHA: Everyone knows it's true. Everyone 
in this building knows it's true.

36
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,398
MATT: We just lost Jeff Sessions as a fan. Sorry,
Jeff.

37
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,941
LIAM: Is that available as merch, by the way?

38
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,955
SAM: Yeah.

39
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:51,029
TALIESIN: Just see me out back.

40
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,786
TRAVIS: Cash me outside.

41
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:55,495
(laughter)

42
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:56,644
MATT: Oh no.

43
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,387
LIAM: Oh god, how do you herd seven cats?

44
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,645
MATT: I don't know! How do you do it, Liam?

45
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:00,646
LIAM: I don't know how.

46
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:02,304
(laughter)

47
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:05,736
LIAM: Hey, Taliesin, tell us about this Wednesday
Club thing you do.

48
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:10,231
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. This week on Wednesday Club, we
thought it would be fun to delve into manga!

49
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,452
That's right, there's a new camera here, that's
crazy.

50
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,658
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I was looking at the wrong one
because it's so bright.

51
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:15,543
TALIESIN: I know.

52
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,859
LAURA: That's the one we're looking at.

53
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,385
SAM: Yeah, we'll have to flag that off, probably.

54
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:20,298
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's like the HAL 9000.

55
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,281
LIAM: And the cameras feel like eavesdroppers.

56
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,441
TRAVIS: It's fine. You're a baby.

57
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:29,959
MARISHA: We can turn it down more. Can we tilt
down this red light more? So it's not in their

58
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,810
eyes? Okay. Keep going.

59
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,752
TALIESIN: We're going to be talking about manga.
It's going to be a lot of fun. Join us, we may have

60
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:39,441
a guest, we may not, I'm not entirely sure. I've
just been so delighted by this, I've ignored

61
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,800
everything else in my life. Wednesdays at noon on
this very channel, where you are right now. Come

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,183
check it out.

63
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,154
MARISHA: Woot.

64
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,389
LAURA: Woot!

65
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,714
LIAM: On to you for Signal Boost?

66
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:57,607
MARISHA: Angie Hill was on this week. Holy shit.
She's a badass MMA fighter who always shows up to

67
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,659
her weigh-ins in cosplay. She's dope.

68
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,325
MATT: Yeah, she showed up as Dhalsim to a weigh-in.
It was like the best thing ever. It was amazing.

69
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:05,822
MARISHA: She's rad.

70
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,277
MATT: Like a very accurate outfit.

71
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:12,340
MARISHA: Yeah, she came out, she drove up from San
Diego, yeah. She's cool. So she was on the show.

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,823
And guess who's up next week?

73
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,807
TRAVIS: What, high school awkward pose?

74
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:17,668
SAM: Marisha Ray?

75
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:18,613
LAURA: Is that you?

76
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:19,609
MARISHA: No. Liam O'Brien.

77
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,402
LAURA: Oh, okay.

78
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,523
ASHLEY: Liam O'Brien!

79
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:22,682
MARISHA: That guy!

80
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,222
SAM: He's taking over all the shows.

81
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:28,012
LIAM: Yep. Yes, I'm doing Wednesday Club. I'm the
President of Nerdist as well!

82
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:30,402
TALIESIN: Liam and Sundry.

83
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,311
LAURA: (laughs) Liam and Sundry.

84
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:38,746
LIAM: Hey, also, Marisha, Taliesin, and Matthew
here, are going to Momocon! For my birthday

85
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:41,044
weekend, on May 25th through 28th. I won't be
here.

86
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,725
LAURA: Hey. We share that birthday weekend, don't
just call it yours.

87
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,436
LIAM: (whispers) I'm sitting in the chair, Laura.

88
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,854
(laughter)

89
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:56,433
LIAM: Okay, so go see them if you're in the
vicinity of Atlanta, Georgia. Also, I think this

90
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:00,060
is the time for you to give us an announcement
about a project you're working on?

91
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,657
LAURA: So, it just got announced! A new game that
I'm working on called Farpoint! Got a story

92
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:11,523
trailer for it, it's a VR game for Sony
PlayStation VR, it's totally cool. I tweeted out

93
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:15,520
the story trailers, if you want to go check it
out. It looks super awesome, and it was so fun to

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,149
work on, and the story was really awesome too. And
then last week, we released a cinematic trailer

95
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:27,756
for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy! And got a release
date for it, which is August 22nd, which I'm very

96
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:29,416
excited about, as well!

97
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,797
TRAVIS: Air punch it.

98
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,181
LAURA: Woo woo!

99
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:38,625
LIAM: Boy, everybody feels really 12 tonight.
That's good! That's perfect. Also, Talks Machina

100
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:44,295
is live on Tuesday nights. 7PM on Twitch. Don't
forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week,

101
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:48,577
use TalksMachina@gmail.com. Matt, you had
something you wanted to throw out?

102
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:53,732
MATT: Yeah, when we did the charity drive, where
we played Mansions of Madness, about a month or so

103
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:59,099
ago, one of the things that I said off-the-cuff
was that if we got a certain point, a certain

104
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:06,403
donation list, I'd do a two-hour hangout Q and A,
and then Brian Foster said that if we make even

105
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:12,621
more, he'll do it in a silk robe. Well we hit both
those goals, we finally scheduled it. I know,

106
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:15,612
yeah, yeah you get to talk to him about that
today.

107
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,733
ASHLEY: He has so many silk robes, so it's fine.

108
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,495
MATT: (laughs) Oh, I ordered one. It's awful. It's
going to be great.

109
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:23,334
LAURA: Is it purple? Tell me it's purple.

110
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,860
MATT: It's red. It's bright red.

111
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,110
LAURA: Ooh, nice.

112
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,348
MATT: It's heinous. But, next Tuesday, from 4 to
6PM, here on the Twitch channel, it's going to be

113
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:35,584
a date with me and the chat. For two hours.

114
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,693
MARISHA: It's going to be awesome.

115
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,764
MATT: I'm going to have wine, and a nice robe, and
it's going to be kind of like--

116
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:44,929
MARISHA: We're going to have dinner-- no, he's
going to have dinner in like POV.

117
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,117
MATT: Yeah, we're going to figure that out. I'm
hoping to do that. What was the Christopher Walken

118
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,207
character? With the wine?

119
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,872
SAM: Oh, the Continental?

120
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,572
MATT: I'm hoping it's something like that. It's
kind of what I'm going for. But anyway, during

121
00:05:56,572 --> 00:06:01,008
that time also, I'm going to finally make up on
those promises even on an older charity, where I'm

122
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:04,018
going to work with the chat to create an NPC for
Critical Role and create a possible future

123
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,212
encounter.

124
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:07,784
SAM: So we should watch that so we know--

125
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,045
MATT: (sings) You should not watch that at all,
you guys are banned from it or I'll kill your

126
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,092
character.

127
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,888
(laughter)

128
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:17,485
MATT: That's next Tuesday, at 4 to 6PM Pacific
here on Twitch. Thank you, Liam.

129
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:19,690
MARISHA: So, it's going to be you and then Talks
at 7PM?

130
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,715
MATT: And then Talks at 7PM, yeah, so it's going
to be a nice little transition.

131
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,463
LIAM: Almost through these. There is also going to
be a new Tabletop promo airing during the break

132
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:32,506
that we're pretty stoked about, so don't walk off
and pee immediately. And then lastly, I need to do

133
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:38,644
a couple of thank-yous. You guys have been seeing
them all week. These miniatures here. I have two

134
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:45,067
people or organisations that I want to thank. One
is heroforge.com. If you haven't already heard of

135
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:51,500
Hero Forge, you can go to heroforge.com and design
and tweak a miniature just the way you want. You

136
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,127
make it tall, you make it short, you can make them
an elf, you can make them a human, you can give

137
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,570
them guns, you can give them a sword, and then
they 3D print that shit, and they mail it to you.

138
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,931
And that's what happened with all these guys, they
recreated my lovely dork friends as miniatures.

139
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:10,488
I'm very happy with them. And I want to thank
Emerald Knights Comics and Games. They're a local

140
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:18,243
comic shop and game shop that Matt and I frequent,
at least just you and me, and they're @ekcomics on

141
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:23,958
Twitter. I will tweet all this stuff out, either
later tonight or tomorrow. But I wanted to mention

142
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:29,655
these things. Matt and I get asked about these a
lot, and they've been a part of our campaign since

143
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:34,377
pretty much the beginning. I just associate them
with Dungeons and Dragons. But they're hard to

144
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:40,126
come by, and everyone's always asking where we get
them. And Julian Rodriguez at Emerald Knights.

145
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:48,311
Well, first of all, Julian painted these for me,
so thank you Julian, they're beautiful. And Julian

146
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:52,025
and Emerald Knights are responsible for these
things. They've been out of stock for a while.

147
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:56,537
They're going to be back in stock in May, and
you'll be able to find them probably in your local

148
00:07:56,537 --> 00:08:02,302
store, but if not, on the Paizo webstore. I've
been asked a hundred times about thesel

149
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,513
LAURA: How do you spell Paizo?

150
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,104
MATT: P-A-I-Z-O.com.

151
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,163
LIAM: Thank you.

152
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,172
TRAVIS: I have a question about those, are they
edible like the ones in Fraggle Rock?

153
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,933
LAURA: (gasps) Are they made out of radishes?

154
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,480
LIAM: If you try hard enough.

155
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,494
TRAVIS: I have wanted to eat those my entire
life.

156
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,990
MATT: Oh yeah, dude. Dude, those structures are
legit!

157
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,538
ASHLEY: I forgot about those!

158
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:25,300
LIAM: So you might have a half-elf ranger in your
party who is obsessed and will do anything and

159
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,470
everything to fucking fly. Boom. Done. There you
go.

160
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,499
MARISHA: Okay, because when I bought those for
you, way before we even thought about having a

161
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:38,559
show, back when we very first started dating, I'm
pretty sure they just custom-made those. Julian

162
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,541
custom-made those himself and just sold them.

163
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,080
MATT: And just sold them in a box in the store.

164
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,526
MARISHA: And now, I think, because--

165
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:46,866
MATT: Like, the whole internet explosion in media,
D&amp;D.

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,666
MARISHA: Yeah, they're starting to make them on
mass scale.

167
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:54,281
LIAM: They will be readily available in May, and
I'll make sure to update Critters as that happens,

168
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:59,475
so thank you. Thank you Hero Forge, and thank you
Emerald Knights. Gorgeous. Boink.

169
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,281
SAM: I have something to say, Liam.

170
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:02,627
LIAM: (whispers) Let's hear it.

171
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:06,640
SAM: I don't have an announcement, and neither
does Ashley. So Ashley, how you doing?

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,209
ASHLEY: I'm great, how are you?

173
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,311
SAM: I'm pretty good.

174
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:11,627
ASHLEY: You know, just, second week in a row, just
here.

175
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:13,226
LAURA: Just to hang out.

176
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:14,752
MATT: Yeah. Got more coming?

177
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:15,782
ASHLEY: Yeah.

178
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,018
MATT: Yeah? You going to be here a while?

179
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:17,942
ASHLEY: Yeah.

180
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:21,227
(cheering)

181
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:28,848
LIAM: With so much new information to process.
Well. God, I don't know what I'm doing. Let's play

182
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,129
the game, all right?

183
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,475
(cheering)

184
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:36,676
LIAM: And dive into a little Critical Role.

185
00:09:36,676 --> 00:11:06,977
[dramatic music]

186
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,260
LIAM: It was good. It was weaker than the first
attempt.

187
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,279
MATT: You know, this is my first chance to
actually do this to you, and I keep getting

188
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,513
completely swarmed by everyone else, so it's
good.

189
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:20,600
LIAM: Well, they're all pros.

190
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:22,481
TRAVIS (laughs) The uncertainty.

191
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:23,961
LIAM: Pee pockets? Is that what I heard?

192
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:24,957
MATT: Not from me.

193
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:25,833
LIAM: Yeah.

194
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,866
MATT: No. I had a good one.

195
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,470
LIAM: Sam! Let's you and I talk for a moment.

196
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,593
SAM: (gasps) Does everyone else need to leave?

197
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,663
LAURA: No. Do not make us get up right at the
beginning.

198
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:36,950
LIAM: You.

199
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,114
SAM: Sam Riegel.

200
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:46,254
LIAM: Are dreaming. You are seeing visions that
make very little sense to you. You're at work,

201
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:53,534
back in one of the countless recording studios
you're in week after week. No biggie. Only the

202
00:11:53,534 --> 00:12:02,548
dream all goes to shit. You see colleagues torn to
pieces. A massive serpent's tail. A great and

203
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:14,807
terrible god creature looming over you for an
instant, and then gone. A dog. An angel. A

204
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:27,508
comedian's corpse. And a tower. And at a certain
point, you come to realise that you are in fact

205
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:34,116
dreaming. Within the dream. You are in that
in-between moment, aware that what you're seeing

206
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:41,446
isn't real, but you don't want to wake up yet.
Grasping at slumber still. But uncomfortable.

207
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:47,257
Something is pressing into your back, a little
painfully. The dream fades,

208
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,523
and you try to hold on to--

209
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:52,062
SAM: It's not a dick, Laura.

210
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,755
LIAM: It is, in fact, my dick.

211
00:12:53,755 --> 00:13:00,805
(laughter)

212
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:04,738
LIAM: The dream fades. You try to hold onto your
sleep state, but that pain in your back-- which is

213
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:15,010
definitely not my dick-- and the humidity. You
feel sweaty. You become aware of how hot and

214
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:22,171
sticky the air is you're breathing. Finally, as
your eyes flutter open, you squint just a little

215
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:39,650
bit against sunlight shining down through a thick
tree cover. You're in a jungle. There it is. Then

216
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:46,021
you're trying to figure out if you're lying inside of
what looks like a massive, hollowed-out tree

217
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:52,859
trunk, for a second? But no. Out of place with the
rest of the dark, mottled, reddish-brown tree

218
00:13:52,859 --> 00:14:05,666
cover far above are four rusted, vine-entangled
beams rising up around you. You're in the middle

219
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:16,217
of what seems to be a square, dead-center, with
these four metal beams stretching and ending in

220
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:22,407
the air. But they're not bare; they're wrapped
around with plant life and vines, and there's

221
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:30,041
vines hanging from beam to beam, and it's almost
like you're in a canopy bed with no top, covered

222
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:39,889
with green. Also, scattered around, you see a few
lumps of knotted wood here and there. Or maybe

223
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:47,835
gourds? You don't know. Oh, your vision doubles
for a second, and you feel a strange pulling

224
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:53,349
sensation on your eyeballs, your head, as the air
almost seems to pulse for a minute. You feel a

225
00:14:53,349 --> 00:15:10,719
brief wave of nausea, but then it passes. Oh shit,
your back hurts. The next thing you notice is what

226
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:20,435
you're lying in. You see what looks like a large--
all around you, unfurled, rind, or petals of some

227
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:28,386
sort of plant. You are in a plant. And there's a
large hump of brownish-red plant matter rising

228
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:34,042
from the center of this thing, and there's small
little tendrils climbing up around your leg.

229
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:38,840
They're not moving, but they are roped and snaked
around your legs. You give a little tug, and you

230
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:48,218
are held in place. And the other thing you see are
two sleeping little kids.

231
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:51,043
SAM: Oh. That's nice.

232
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:57,888
LIAM: They're in the same predicament. There's
little tiny miniature vines, almost, whitish

233
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,291
color, coming out of the center of this
reddish-brown plant holding them.

234
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,209
SAM: Are they my kids?

235
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,501
LIAM: They're not your kids.

236
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,697
SAM: Oh, thank god.

237
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,044
(laughter)

238
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,433
MATT: Fuck them, they can die.

239
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,117
MARISHA: Yeah. They're not my kids.

240
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:21,348
SAM: First of all, I appreciate you making this
all about me, as it should be.

241
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,778
TRAVIS: Number one on the call sheet.

242
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,068
SAM: I'm going to try to stand up. Is that a thing
I can try to do?

243
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,869
LIAM: You can certainly try.

244
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:34,289
(laughter)

245
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,643
TRAVIS: The first one!

246
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:36,686
ASHLEY: Yeah.

247
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:37,898
LAURA: How's it feel, Matt?

248
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:38,858
MATT: It's great.

249
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,802
(laughter)

250
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:41,628
LIAM: You did this!

251
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:44,437
MATT: You're doing good! Keep going!

252
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,943
LIAM: What do you want to do there, buddy?

253
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:50,258
SAM: Can I sit up in my weird four-poster?

254
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:55,736
LIAM: You are able to sit up. Your legs can't
move, but you sit up, and the pain finally--

255
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,053
whatever was poking you in the back is not--

256
00:16:58,053 --> 00:16:59,727
SAM: Well, I'm looking, what was poking me in the
back?

257
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,695
LIAM: Ooh, there's a really small canine
skeleton.

258
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:10,618
SAM: (gasps) Bixby! Did he have a collar or
anything that I could identify?

259
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:14,005
LIAM: I mean, the bone is bleached white.

260
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:17,748
SAM: Is it about the same size as little Bix?

261
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:18,748
LIAM: Pug-sized?

262
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:19,660
SAM: Yeah.

263
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,540
LIAM: Kind of.

264
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,161
LAURA: Liam O'Brien killed a pug!

265
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,682
[no audio]

266
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:26,297
SAM: How far are the children from me?

267
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:31,231
LIAM: I mean, you could probably reach one of them
if you wanted to. You could reach both of them.

268
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:37,278
There's a girl and a boy. The girl looks, I don't
know, ten or 11. The boy's younger.

269
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:41,664
SAM: Are they asleep? Do they look like they're
alive and asleep?

270
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:42,850
LIAM: They're breathing.

271
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,358
SAM: Okay, I'm going to try to stir one of them,
whoever's closest.

272
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:46,280
LIAM: Which one?

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,124
SAM: Who's closer?

274
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,344
LIAM: They're both equidistant.

275
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:49,447
SAM: The older one.

276
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,419
LIAM: Oh.

277
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,332
SAM: The girl, right?

278
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:55,487
LIAM: Okay, yeah. Laura, you feel like a poke,
poke, poke at your legs.

279
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:58,002
LAURA: I knew it! Ow.

280
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:03,673
LIAM: Your eyes flutter awake, and you see a
really fucking bizarre jungle and some little kid

281
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,286
poking at your foot.

282
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:13,856
SAM: Wait, I'm a kid? (whispers) Oh, we're kids!
Muppet Babies!

283
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:18,059
MATT: (sings) Crit Role Babies, it's time to play
some shit.

284
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:23,204
LIAM: The little blond angelic boy sleeps
peacefully as you guys whisper to each other.

285
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,503
SAM: There's a little blond boy?

286
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,633
LIAM: Yeah.

287
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,644
LAURA: Wait, who are you?

288
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,253
SAM: I'm Sam!

289
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,545
LAURA: You're Sam?

290
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,486
SAM: Do we know each other?

291
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,300
LIAM: You just fought dead Conan O'Brien.

292
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,890
SAM: Do I recognize her?

293
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,360
LIAM: Kind of?

294
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,629
LAURA: Sam?

295
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:43,383
SAM: Sam Riegel! TV's Sam Riegel!

296
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,901
LAURA: Sam, you're a kid! What are you talking
about?

297
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,652
TRAVIS: You're that kid from Les Mis!

298
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,408
(laughter)

299
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,509
SAM: Who are you?

300
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:53,099
LAURA: Your face is smaller but your teeth are the
same size!

301
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,548
(laughter)

302
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:55,668
SAM: Who are you?

303
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,554
LAURA: I'm Laura!

304
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,000
SAM: You're too fat to be Laura!

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,954
(laughter)

306
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:05,078
LIAM: Taliesin, you're stirred awake by the sound
of children's voices arguing over your body.

307
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:09,387
LAURA: You dick. Wait, who is that?

308
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,783
SAM: Well, that's Taliesin.

309
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,859
(laughter)

310
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,261
LAURA: Oh, it's that kid from that commercial.

311
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:17,964
SAM: Yeah, I saw him in Mr. Mom. He looks the
same.

312
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:26,310
LIAM: He does, if either of you have seen Mr Mom,
he does look precisely like he did in Mr. Mom.

313
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,396
TALIESIN: It's basically Butters Stotch. I'm
screwed.

314
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:32,112
MARISHA: You totally were!

315
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:33,915
MATT: You were Butters Stotch!

316
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,792
TALIESIN: You're figuring that out now?

317
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,779
LIAM: Just for your benefit, and for the audience,
we're going to be hearing all of the usual

318
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:46,966
Taliesin verbiage and sayings, like "okay" and
"this is going to be fun," except please imagine

319
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:49,893
it in a small, piping widdle voice.

320
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,607
TALIESIN: Can I have a moment to myself?

321
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,416
(laughter)

322
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,965
LIAM: He's still Executive Goth. He's just
seven-ish.

323
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:01,212
LAURA: We're children! What the fuck happened?

324
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,586
SAM: We were just fighting Conan, we beat him.

325
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:04,721
TALIESIN: Sam?!

326
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:10,588
SAM: Yeah, hi. I know, my teeth are really big. I
haven't gotten any work done.

327
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,178
TALIESIN: No, I've YouTubed you. This makes sense.
What, and--

328
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,253
LAURA: Hi.

329
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:15,816
TALIESIN: Laura!

330
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,062
LAURA: Yeah!

331
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:18,056
TALIESIN: Where's everybody else?

332
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,615
LAURA: I don't know! Where's Bixby?

333
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:26,808
SAM: I'm going to pull out the skull. Huh?

334
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,406
LIAM: That's too big.

335
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:30,489
LAURA: But he's a kid!

336
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,166
SAM: Oh yeah! Little hands.

337
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,525
LIAM: Oh, bring it back up!

338
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,334
(laughter)

339
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:41,958
LAURA: Wait, how old are we? We don't know.

340
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,525
LIAM: You don't know. You're older than both of
them.

341
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,974
LAURA: Fuck yeah, I am. I'm so in charge.

342
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,687
SAM: I think the dog died, when we got younger
somehow.

343
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,924
LAURA: This is so weird. Where's Travis? (gasps)

344
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:53,799
SAM: Oh gosh.

345
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,615
LAURA: Oh god, what if he's still an adult? This
is so weird!

346
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,663
(laughter)

347
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:03,440
LIAM: You guys don't see anything. You are,
again-- you saw this, and you guys are just coming

348
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,547
to and noticing your surroundings. You're in this
square, which doesn't make sense, because you're

349
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:16,007
in the jungle, right? But you're in this square
canopy plant room, almost.

350
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,811
LAURA: How the fuck do we get out of here?

351
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,936
SAM: Here, hold my hand, and we'll pull each other
and try to pull each other up and out of here.

352
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,369
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm grabbing it.

353
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:24,941
SAM: We'll all make a weird kid triangle.

354
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:27,217
LAURA: And try to pull towards each other.

355
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:30,498
LIAM: Everybody make a strength check with
advantage.

356
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,802
LAURA: Wait, what do we add to it?

357
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,553
LIAM: Nothing.

358
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:35,977
SAM: I got an 11.

359
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,857
LAURA: Ooh! I'm so much older than them. I got an
18.

360
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,163
TALIESIN: I got a two-- ten.

361
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,676
LIAM: A two ten?

362
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:42,969
TALIESIN: I got a ten.

363
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:50,823
LIAM: A ten. Okay. All right. Well, the little
blond kid, barely able to rip any of the plant

364
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:57,840
away from his feet, but this bigger kid grabs you
both and pulls both of you out, and it just rips

365
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,101
away. It's not too bad, with you guys working
together. And now you're standing, the three of

366
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:07,841
you, in a little circle, standing in this little
chapel in the jungle.

367
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,794
LAURA: What do we do?

368
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:15,271
SAM: We've got to look for our friends and figure
out what the hell's going on.

369
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,684
LAURA: Yeah.

370
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:21,879
SAM: And last thing I remember, we were doing a
voiceover session

371
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,906
and all hell broke loose, right?

372
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,832
LAURA: Yeah!

373
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:26,086
TALIESIN:There was Conan O'Brien!

374
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:27,384
LAURA: And we fought him, and we killed him.

375
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:28,151
SAM: Yeah.

376
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:29,287
LAURA: And you almost killed Travis!

377
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:30,581
SAM: He cut my arm off!

378
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,032
LAURA: Where's Travis?

379
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:36,607
LIAM: The air around you hits you with
another (whump), and you feel your skin and bones

380
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:42,569
kind of shake a little bit, and your stomach just
feels like it drops. The feeling passes.

381
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,821
SAM: I let go of her hand, because girls are
icky.

382
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:50,256
LAURA: Was that a time shift? Did we just shift
through time? Are we older?

383
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:54,871
TALIESIN: Looking around, we're still in that
cube, right?

384
00:22:54,871 --> 00:23:04,325
LIAM: Yeah, again, you can see out. These metal
beams going up that lead to nothing, and are just

385
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:05,577
sort of mangled.

386
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:08,094
LAURA: Wait, give me a boost, I'm going to climb
up the beam.

387
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,138
LIAM: Okay.

388
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,128
LAURA: I'm going to try to climb up the beam,
because it's covered in vines, right? I can grab

389
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,236
on to something.

390
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:13,405
LIAM: Absolutely.

391
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:14,462
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to try to climb up to the
top.

392
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,326
SAM: Okay, we'll help.

393
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,433
LIAM: Make an athletics check.

394
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,622
LAURA: Do I add anything to it?

395
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:19,231
LIAM: Add two. I'm making that up.

396
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,545
LAURA: 15!

397
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:26,903
LIAM: Yeah, totally! You climb your way up there.
It takes you, like, a minute? You don't want to

398
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:30,899
fall down, you don't want to cut yourself on this
rusty beam. You make your way up, and you grab

399
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:37,350
onto the twisted top of this beam. It's all caked
over with plant, and a little bit of mud, even,

400
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,456
but you can see where there used to be bolts, sort
of sprung open on the top. And you pull yourself

401
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:55,287
up and over. No, that's better. And you can
finally see out and over and the jungle stretches

402
00:23:55,344 --> 00:24:02,706
out in every direction. You can see here and
there, on other trees-- and when I say trees, the

403
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:12,865
trees are more brown and red than anything, and
they're wet, and they have sort of a bulging

404
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:22,091
sausage feel to them? And they do have leaves, but
the leaves are, again, mottled brown and red. And

405
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:26,732
the whole jungle you're in, sunlight does come
down and in, but it's pretty dim overall, and

406
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:34,853
everything is tinted with that color. And you see
these lumps of hardened, what look like-- they

407
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,580
don't have the texture of coconuts. They have the
texture of a chestnut, maybe. But they're just

408
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,381
growing out of spots on trees. Some are hanging
from a vine on different trees. And you can't see

409
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:49,035
where to go. Everything looks the same in
different directions, although it is more open

410
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:57,172
from this view, because down below, between these
four beams, it's all wrapped around. And you see

411
00:24:57,172 --> 00:25:00,324
two little kids going like this.

412
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:04,145
LAURA: And I don't see any other sign of life?

413
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:07,026
LIAM: Make a perception check.

414
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:08,831
LAURA: Do I add anything?

415
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,494
LIAM: Add a Laura Bailey plus three.

416
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,652
LAURA: 18.

417
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:25,768
LIAM: Oh wow. Yeah. About a hundred feet that way,
you see another opened plant on the ground. It's

418
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:34,724
obscured by a tree, but you can see it behind the
tree. And you see a jean leg and a sneaker, and it

419
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:41,395
looks bent badly and bloodied. And then you see
another leg with a shoe, poking out the other side

420
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:43,322
of the tree.

421
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:47,502
LAURA: (gasps) Well, I climb down and I say, I saw
a body, and we should go find it!

422
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,169
SAM: Okay, let's go.

423
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:53,592
TALIESIN: Contention point, are we wearing kid
clothes? Are we wearing kid clothes or tiny

424
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,084
versions of our old clothes?

425
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:57,327
LIAM: You're wearing clothes that seems to fit.

426
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:00,411
TALIESIN: Okay. Just checking.

427
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,045
LIAM: This is science.

428
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:04,449
(laughter)

429
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,035
TALIESIN: Kind of curious.

430
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,731
SAM: All right, let's go!

431
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:08,955
TALIESIN: All right.

432
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:16,490
SAM: But wait! We don't know anything about where
we are, so we should look and stealth, maybe? And

433
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,002
sneak over there?

434
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,035
LAURA: Sure!

435
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,296
SAM: So as not to awaken a beast?

436
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,264
LAURA: Yeah, but we should get over there quickly,
because that's Travis!

437
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,950
SAM: Okay! Oh, you know? Okay!

438
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,494
LAURA: It should be. I think it's Travis!

439
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:27,840
SAM: Let's go!

440
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,229
LIAM: All right, so after you scuttle down and
have this little mini child argument. It's not too

441
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:35,651
hard, I mean, you just pull apart vines and
plants, and you can push your way through.

442
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,433
LAURA: Be careful of the bulging sausages!

443
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:42,801
LIAM: Everything is slick to the touch, and you
grease by it all--

444
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,957
LAURA: Of the wet, bulging sausages!

445
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,504
TALIESIN: I think that's sound advice.

446
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:51,067
LIAM: Hashtag. Are you stealthing there?

447
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,698
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we're sneaking.

448
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,166
LIAM: Well make a stealth check, motherfuckers.

449
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,291
SAM: 13.

450
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,446
LAURA: Oh. What do we add? Ooh, that's good.

451
00:26:58,446 --> 00:26:59,413
TALIESIN: 19.

452
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,471
LAURA: That's a pretty die.

453
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:01,708
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yeah, it's nice.

454
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,585
LIAM: Laura.

455
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:03,464
LAURA: Seven.

456
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:06,384
LIAM: Seven. Okay. She's a little bigger. She
tromps round a little more than you little

457
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:07,238
light-footed--

458
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,427
LAURA: Plus I'm really worried.

459
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:14,438
LIAM: Yep, got to get to your adult husband,
waiting on the other side of this tree. All right, so

460
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:23,980
you creep along. There's insects, and you can hear
stuff out there, but nothing happens, nothing

461
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:28,414
shocking or scary, and you make your way, in just a
couple of minutes, over to where this plant is,

462
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:37,879
and you come around the tree, and you see three
kids. One kid is really dead. What you couldn't

463
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:42,681
see on the back of the tree that was blocking the
view, has splintered off and fallen on a child,

464
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:50,202
and that child is crushed like the Wicked Witch of
the West's sister. All you see is one mangled leg

465
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,411
coming out the bottom and an arm coming out the
other side.

466
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:55,506
MATT: It'll be me, so I don't get a chance to
play.

467
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,301
(laughter)

468
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,329
MATT: Sorry.

469
00:27:58,329 --> 00:27:59,926
MARISHA: Thanks for coming.

470
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:06,796
LIAM: And a little bit of spaghetti marinara. But
you also see two kids in here. There is another

471
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:10,939
older girl, looks a little older than you, brown
hair, dark hair, and there's a kid that looks like

472
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:17,388
Vern from Stand By Me. He's a little chunky kid in
a polo shirt, and he is snoring, now that you're

473
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,575
closer and you can hear.

474
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:22,708
LAURA: Does it look like I would know what Travis
looked like when he was a kid?

475
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,330
LIAM: Yeah, you know what your husband looks like.
You know what the child version of your husband

476
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,719
looks like, and that's your BFF, Ashley, except
she looks like a rebel in middle school.

477
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:34,053
(laughter)

478
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:39,362
LIAM: And they're sound asleep, and Verno is just
(snores).

479
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:44,220
LAURA: (gasps) Travis! And I go slap him awake.
How old is he? How old are you? Do I look older

480
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,039
than you?

481
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,785
LIAM: You're in your 30s, right?

482
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:48,827
TRAVIS: Yeah!

483
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,965
(laughter)

484
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:54,651
LAURA: Oh wait. You-- no, you're still a kid,
you're a kid too.

485
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,729
TRAVIS: Oh. (higher) Yeah.

486
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,244
LAURA: Baby!

487
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:00,499
TRAVIS: Who are you?

488
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:05,406
LAURA: You know what I look like when I'm a kid,
man! I'm your wife! You're my husband.

489
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:08,786
LIAM: He's taking this really well that you're
both children.

490
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:15,437
TRAVIS: Why are my hands so small? Why do I look
like Vern from Stand By Me? Where is this gross

491
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:19,022
polo coming from? And my tiny 80s shorts?

492
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:22,801
LAURA: You know you wore shit like that, don't
even.

493
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:26,082
TRAVIS: Why are my socks all the way up to 
the bottom of my knees?

494
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,107
(laughter)

495
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,449
LIAM: That is canon!

496
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:31,657
TRAVIS: Why do these shoes have velcro straps on
them?

497
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:36,927
LIAM: Ashley, you're shaken awake, and you're
looking at a bunch of fucking children around you,

498
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,562
and you're in a jungle, and everything is wet!

499
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:40,782
LAURA: Ashley?

500
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:43,380
ASHLEY: What's going on? How do you know my name?

501
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,678
LAURA: Ashley, it's us.

502
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:45,917
ASHLEY: Who is us?

503
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,588
SAM: That's Laura and Travis.

504
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:49,021
TRAVIS: Why are you calling her Ashley?

505
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,591
TALIESIN and LAURA: And Taliesin!

506
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:54,217
SAM: From I Shot The Sheriff's Mom or whatever it
was?

507
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:57,499
TALIESIN: She's the Sheriff. Did you not watch
television as a child? Good god.

508
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,229
ASHLEY: Butters Scotch.

509
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:01,103
(laughter)

510
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:07,003
LIAM: Ashley, the last thing you remember is
falling asleep watching a movie on a plane from

511
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:09,361
New York City to LA.

512
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:19,301
ASHLEY: I was on a plane! I fell asleep and now
I'm here! I was watching-- what was I watching?

513
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:23,113
TRAVIS: What were you watching?

514
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,386
ASHLEY: Moana.

515
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:26,891
(laughter)

516
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,126
ASHLEY: So good.

517
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,614
LAURA: It was really good!

518
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:32,620
ASHLEY: And now we're here. Oh, man, this is
weird.

519
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,058
LIAM: Your voice is a little higher than you're
accustomed to.

520
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:37,910
ASHLEY: Why is my voice higher than it usually
is?

521
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,862
LAURA: Because you're a kid! You're like you in
What Women Want.

522
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:44,116
(laughter)

523
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:45,173
ASHLEY: How old am I?

524
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:49,338
LIAM: I don't know. You're a little older than
this one. You're much bigger than these two.

525
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,632
You're a little bigger than this one.

526
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,471
MARISHA: So maybe What Women Want?

527
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:54,544
LAURA: No, younger than that.

528
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:55,892
MARISHA: Oh, Annie era?

529
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:58,339
MATT: We'll just go through your imdb and just
pick the right time.

530
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,621
MARISHA: Just google Ashley real quick, hang on.

531
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:02,135
LIAM: She's probably brushing into her teens.

532
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,302
MATT: Okay.

533
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:05,115
ASHLEY: So it's punk Ashley.

534
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,373
TRAVIS: (voice breaking) Should all of our voices,
like, be--

535
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,365
SAM: Yeah, let's do that for the next three
hours.

536
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:14,347
ASHLEY: Okay! What have you guys seen so far?

537
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:20,105
LIAM: The air around you trembles, and you feel
that same push of energy and your skull seems to

538
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:26,551
rattle, and your gut goes (noise) and you feel
yourself pushing-- nothing happens.

539
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:31,366
LAURA: I run over to the other body, and see what
kid it was. Do I recognize him?

540
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:35,473
LIAM: I mean, if you could do a backwards time
lapse of the skull being crushed down into the

541
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,292
ground by the tree, you might know.

542
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,112
LAURA: I hope this isn't anybody we knew.

543
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,989
ASHLEY: Can we tell if boy or girl?

544
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:44,015
LIAM: You don't know. What do you want to do?

545
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:45,378
MARISHA: Are you Bones?

546
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:47,114
TRAVIS: Are there any pockets that aren't covered
in--

547
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:51,765
LIAM: It's not bones, it's just all that's poking
out is a leg and spaghetti marinara from where a

548
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,817
head was, and--

549
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:54,151
LAURA: And it's a kid body?

550
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:54,873
LIAM: Yeah.

551
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:55,747
LAURA: That's fucked.

552
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,180
TRAVIS: Can I search the kid's pockets?

553
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,307
LIAM: Sure.

554
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,572
TALIESIN: I'll help. Yeah.

555
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,773
LIAM: (whispers) You kind of feel a wiener through
the pocket.

556
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:02,959
LAURA: Oh.

557
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,260
LIAM: (whispers) Kind of.

558
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,743
ASHLEY: What is it? Anything in the pocket?

559
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:09,467
TRAVIS: Is there anything in the pocket?

560
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:10,656
LIAM: Just the wiener.

561
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:16,238
TRAVIS: Just a little-- nope! Not a thing!
Nothing.

562
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,606
SAM: You touched a wiener?

563
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:28,335
LIAM: You guys all hear, now, off in the distance,
a whumping sound, just like (thudding)

564
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:30,105
way far away.

565
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:32,450
LAURA: Do we have our weapons from before?

566
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,433
TALIESIN: We don't have anything from before.

567
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:35,719
SAM: Find sticks!

568
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:39,089
LAURA: We've got to find some sticks! Everybody
get a stick!

569
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,619
SAM: We're going to look for sticks and rocks.

570
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,128
LIAM: Okay. Sure, they're everywhere.

571
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,631
ASHLEY: Can I get a strong vine?

572
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:48,702
LIAM: Yes. Make a strength check real quick.
You've got to pull it off of a tree.

573
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:53,017
ASHLEY: Do I add anything?

574
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:55,105
LIAM: You can add one.

575
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,725
ASHLEY: 19.

576
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:02,015
LIAM: 19. Oh man! You snap it, and as soon as
you do, the break point goes (raspberry) and you

577
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:06,773
look like you just got sprayed in the face with
horror-movie blood, your face just went

578
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:11,669
(raspberry) as soon as you did it. It burst like
an angry zit as soon as you broke it, but now

579
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:16,659
you're holding this mostly solid, but with a
little bit of give, and slick as hell.

580
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:18,792
ASHLEY: Do I look scary?

581
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,227
LAURA: Yes, you do!

582
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:21,811
TRAVIS: (cries)

583
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,928
ASHLEY: Oh no! Hey, don't cry!

584
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:25,074
LAURA: Don't cry.

585
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:26,116
ASHLEY: Don't cry, it's okay.

586
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:29,054
TRAVIS: I haven't seen an R-rated movie at this
point. (cries)

587
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,311
(laughter)

588
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:32,112
LIAM: You are still you.

589
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:35,205
TRAVIS: I know, I ran out of Jurassic Park in the
theater!

590
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:37,422
LIAM: I mean it's accurate. You're really scared
of scary movies.

591
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:39,812
TRAVIS: Yeah I seriously am. (cries)

592
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:42,908
LAURA: We're still adults, Travis. We're just in
kid bodies.

593
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:44,453
TRAVIS: I don't feel adult.

594
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,931
LIAM: Boom, boom.

595
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:47,215
SAM; Wait, we're hearing things.

596
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,331
LIAM: Boom.

597
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:49,621
LAURA: (gasps) I grab a rock.

598
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:50,781
TALIESIN: I grab a stick.

599
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:51,557
LIAM: Okay.

600
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:52,699
TALIESIN: We hide.

601
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,739
LAURA: And hide behind anything that we-- I hide
hide under one of the petals

602
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,356
of one of the flowers.

603
00:33:56,356 --> 00:34:01,281
LIAM: Okay. Smells really nasty. You're under it.
And it is wet. And now your shirt is wet, and your

604
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:02,819
pants are wet.

605
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:04,707
LAURA: I'm in a dress.

606
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:07,975
(laughter)

607
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:09,607
LAURA: But whatever.

608
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:14,949
SAM: A wet dress.

609
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,152
LAURA: Do you guys see it? Are we hiding? Are all
of us hiding?

610
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:22,338
TALIESIN: Does this stuff have a planty smell, or
kind of a meaty smell?

611
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:23,693
LIAM: Yeah.

612
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,556
TALIESIN: Is it a bit of a meaty smell?

613
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:26,581
LIAM: Yeah.

614
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,620
TALIESIN: Oh no.

615
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,360
LIAM: You ever smell that flower that's like the
world's worst?

616
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,159
TALIESIN:Yes, I have. The Centennial flower.

617
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,114
LIAM: That.

618
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,245
LAURA:Yeah, smells like a dead body.

619
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,380
LIAM: But that sound's not getting any closer.
It's off in the distance. It's intermittent.

620
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,380
LAURA: Oh. Should I come out?

621
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,465
SAM: Yeah. You just got all wet and muddy, and
now--

622
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:44,214
LAURA: Man. Should we find Matt and Marisha,
because they were with us too? Are they the ones

623
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,596
that got us here?

624
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:48,306
SAM: Were they with us? They just appeared out of
nowhere and then disappeared.

625
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:49,927
TRAVIS: Yeah, they were on that awesome
motorcycle.

626
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:52,694
LAURA: Oh yeah, they saved the day. They killed
Conan, didn't they?

627
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,634
SAM: They did, but they looked super scary.

628
00:34:54,634 --> 00:35:00,375
LIAM: The five of you hear a snapping sound, kind
of like when Ashley broke that vine, and you hear

629
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:06,085
(thud) ten feet behind you. And then you hear
smearing, rustling sounds, and then you hear

630
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,446
(cat-like growl).

631
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:10,533
LAURA: I turn around and throw my rock at it!

632
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,368
LIAM: Okay. Roll for initiative.

633
00:35:12,368 --> 00:35:15,480
(laughter)

634
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,624
SAM: Surprise attack. We're all rolling for
initiative?

635
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:19,827
LIAM: I guess so.

636
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,156
MARISHA: Oh snap.

637
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:22,672
TALIESIN: Quick game.

638
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:23,732
SAM: Seven!

639
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:24,655
LIAM: Seven.

640
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:25,494
TALIESIN: Ten.

641
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:26,298
LAURA: Nine.

642
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:27,165
TRAVIS: 11.

643
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:34,759
LIAM: Wait, slow down, assholes. 20 to 25? Nobody.
15 to 20? Ten to 15?

644
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:35,875
TRAVIS: Me, 11.

645
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,064
LIAM: Okay.

646
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,324
TALIESIN: Ten, Taliesin.

647
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,128
LIAM: Ten?

648
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:40,207
ASHLEY: Ten, Ashley.

649
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,679
LIAM: Ten, Ashley. Laura and Sam?

650
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,711
LAURA: Nine.

651
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:44,620
SAM: Seven.

652
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,920
LIAM: Nine. Seven. Okay. All right. You flip
around and see what looks like, I don't know, like

653
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,675
a really pissed off ocelot, or bobcat with no skin
on it. You just see greased red muscle and blood,

654
00:35:57,675 --> 00:36:01,678
and the thing is running at you, and Travis, it's
coming at you, and you act!

655
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:05,896
LAURA: Don't I get that attack? Because I threw a
rock.

656
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:06,975
LIAM: Nah.

657
00:36:06,975 --> 00:36:10,100
(laughter)

658
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,488
LAURA: You'd argue so hard for that if you were
over on this side, man, you would've argued so hard

659
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:15,657
for it.

660
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,214
LIAM: Yeah, maybe.

661
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:22,453
TRAVIS: I'm, like, 11? Right? I am turning and
booking ass away from it, with my spindly little

662
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:24,209
legs, as fast as I can.

663
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:28,977
LIAM: Okay, that is heading you in the direction
of the intermittent whump far in the distance,

664
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,636
but that's fine.

665
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,886
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just running from the naked
cat.

666
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:39,030
LIAM: So, you see a flesh-peeled-- large, the size
of a golden retriever, right, a bobcat, but with

667
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,934
sinew and muscle, and it looks mad as hell, and
it's running, and so is Vern. And Taliesin, what

668
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,478
do you do?

669
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:52,015
TALIESIN: You know, I think I'm going to run, too,
at this point. I'm going to keep this stick, but

670
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:53,201
I'm running.

671
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:54,586
LIAM: Okay.

672
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:56,279
TRAVIS: It's total Goonies run, too, it's like--

673
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:58,534
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (yell)

674
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:01,387
(laughter)

675
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,053
TALIESIN: It's a full-on Goonies run.

676
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:08,175
LIAM: Okay, so, as you lift this rock to throw it
down, it happens too fast, and this thing runs and

677
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:15,215
starts clawing its way up your body, and tearing
down your wet, slick shirt, and hits you for-- it

678
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:16,764
ran right up you--

679
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:18,023
SAM: Wait, is this Laura or Taliesin?

680
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:19,001
LAURA: It's me!

681
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:22,305
LIAM: Laura, and does two hit points of damage.
Just remember that for the time being, please.

682
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,364
LAURA: Okay.

683
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,600
TRAVIS: We haven't even opened anything.

684
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,978
LAURA: We still haven't opened our things!

685
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,148
LIAM: That's right.

686
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,429
ASHLEY: I want to know what's inside!

687
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:29,829
LIAM: Ashley, what are you going to do?

688
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:36,816
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to take the vine, and I'm
going to (lasso sounds).

689
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:41,080
LIAM: Okay, so you run up to your friend Laura,
who's getting mangled--

690
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,402
ASHLEY: Oh, so I'm close enough to run up to it?

691
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:44,697
LIAM: Sure.

692
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,041
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm just going to--

693
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,095
LIAM: You're going to try to--

694
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:49,447
MATT: Try and garrote it.

695
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:55,620
LIAM: Okay. Sure. Roll a d20. We'll do a grapple.

696
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:01,404
ASHLEY: Do I add anything?

697
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:05,440
LIAM: You can add one. For now.

698
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,771
TALIESIN: You have a lasso at your house, too,
don't you?

699
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:08,670
ASHLEY: I do.

700
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,653
TALIESIN: Yeah.

701
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,043
MARISHA: Ashley's proficient in all weapons.

702
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:14,045
LIAM: Seems like your number is low.

703
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:14,780
ASHLEY: It's not.

704
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,604
LIAM: It's not? What is it?

705
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:16,548
ASHLEY: 17.

706
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:19,182
LIAM: Okay. You get a good grip on it, and pull it
in tight; it is so smeared with blood, it goes

707
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:24,389
(squelch), flies up two feet in the air and comes
back down and then claws its way back down Laura

708
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,185
and just starts rending and continues to rend.

709
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:30,722
ASHLEY: Can I do anything else?

710
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:37,728
LIAM: Well, you can move. You can move a little
bit. You can get the fuck out of Dodge.

711
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:39,934
ASHLEY: No, I don't want to leave her!

712
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,323
LIAM: Sam. What are you doing?

713
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:42,609
SAM: Any rocks around? Big rocks?

714
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:44,976
LIAM: Yeah, a couple by your feet. If you reach
down and grab them.

715
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:47,183
SAM: I'm going to grab one and just hit it in the
skull.

716
00:38:47,183 --> 00:38:48,792
LIAM: Hit it in the skull? Roll to attack.

717
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,075
SAM: Okay. Nine.

718
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:52,106
LIAM: Nine.

719
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:54,773
(laughter)

720
00:38:54,773 --> 00:39:00,520
LIAM: You are not used to being as short as you
are, and you totally swing and it goes over the

721
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,115
thing's head, and you slip in some guts from that
kid's head, and you go down.

722
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,382
LAURA: Do I get to go?

723
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:09,277
SAM: Oh yeah, it was her turn, actually.

724
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:12,984
LIAM: Yes, this whole game's about tormenting you,
Laura.

725
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,632
(laughter)

726
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,491
LAURA: Well.

727
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,360
LIAM: Go!

728
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,287
ASHLEY: Get it!

729
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:20,459
LAURA: Okay, I guess I'll try and hit it with the
rock while Ashley's trying to--

730
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,186
LIAM: Sure, go for it.

731
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,937
LAURA: 15!

732
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:29,609
LIAM: Oh man, that rock comes down and crunches on
this thing's head. Roll a d4, please. Oh. No.

733
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,468
Yeah. d4. That's right.

734
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:33,505
LAURA: Four!

735
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:40,471
LIAM: Four. You smash the thing's head in, and it
goes (squeal), and it (raspberries)

736
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:43,113
down onto the ground.

737
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,977
ASHLEY: Good job!

738
00:39:44,977 --> 00:39:46,242
SAM: You killed it!

739
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,590
LAURA: Well, Ashley, you--

740
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,056
ASHLEY: No, I didn't do it, it slipped right out.

741
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:52,995
LAURA: Thanks, Travis and Taliesin.

742
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:55,459
TRAVIS: We're just still, like, (yells).

743
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,500
LIAM: Through the jungle, they are just past two
trees, and you've just lost sight of them, and

744
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,848
they've run off.

745
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:01,858
SAM: Come back! It's dead!

746
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,660
LAURA: It's dead!

747
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,577
LIAM: And you hear rustle-rustle-rustle, and then
you hear (thuds).

748
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:06,921
ASHLEY: Another one?

749
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,206
LAURA: Far away? The same place?

750
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,490
LIAM: Far away, same place.

751
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,766
SAM: We have to go after them.

752
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:13,421
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab that one by its tail and
tie it to my belt.

753
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,047
LIAM: Travis and Taliesin, you bust out of some
plants and you find yourself on the edge of--

754
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:19,502
SAM: Wait, you're going to tie the 
animal to your belt?

755
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:20,554
LAURA: Fuck yeah!

756
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:23,999
LIAM: A different area than what you've seen
before. The tree cover is so thick that you're not

757
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:30,465
able to see this coming, but you're looking at a
reddish brown bog. It's a little more open. The

758
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:36,670
trees open up a bit, and you can see patches of
stagnant brackish water on the ground here and

759
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:47,221
there, and then way on the other side, 200 feet,
you see, almost Audrey II style, ten feet tall--

760
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:53,570
seven feet tall. That was too big. Seven feet
tall, and there is a little thin wiry bent-over

761
00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:03,804
old man with a rock, and nasty clothes, tattered
and disgusting, and he's peeled one of these

762
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:11,321
petals back and he's beating on the side of it as
hard as he can, but he's very old. And he's 200

763
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:12,670
feet away.

764
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,573
TRAVIS: Is he doing it in a frenetic way or is he
just methodically--

765
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:20,374
LIAM: He's taking a couple whacks at it and then
pausing to rest for a second.

766
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:22,221
TRAVIS: (panting) There's a guy!

767
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:23,876
TALIESIN: Let's check it out! I'm heading over.

768
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:25,361
LIAM: You're just going to run through?

769
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,822
TALIESIN: I'm going to be careful where I'm
walking.

770
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:30,011
LIAM: That's fine, but you're not sneaky.

771
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:33,455
TRAVIS: You've got beautiful blond hair, you
should go.

772
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:36,527
TALIESIN: I'm not being super sneaky, no. He'll
see me coming.

773
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:43,654
LIAM: Okay. You start splashing through muck and
puddles on your way there and you make it 20 feet

774
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:48,611
out into the middle of this big circular bog and
the old man goes (croaks). And you catch a glimpse

775
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:57,277
of a reflection of light up on his face. Glasses?
He sees you, books off into

776
00:41:57,277 --> 00:41:59,371
the jungle beyond it, runs.

777
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:00,499
TALIESIN: What?

778
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:04,620
TRAVIS: Oh no! Wait, don't go!

779
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,281
TALIESIN: I feel like we needed an adult here.

780
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:10,526
TRAVIS: I know. What was he hitting?

781
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:12,874
TALIESIN: I'm going to go check out the plant he
was hitting.

782
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:15,080
LIAM: Sure, okay. All right.

783
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,107
TRAVIS: While he's walking up, can I look? Can I
scan?

784
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:19,999
TALIESIN: Where are the others?

785
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:24,341
LIAM: Verno is totally poking his head out of the
heavy tree cover, looking after you. You don't

786
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:29,031
know where the others are. You are now halfway out
across this bog, mucking your way through, this

787
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:33,035
little cherubic seven year old making his way
through hell, there he goes.

788
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:36,010
TRAVIS: It's you and me.

789
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,283
LIAM: You sheepishly whisper across the bog.

790
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:42,169
TRAVIS: (whispers) It's you and me!

791
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:48,868
LIAM: (whispers) I've got your back! Finally you
make it over to this big semi peeled-open gourd,

792
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:54,246
and you look inside to see what's in there, and
you see a head of red hair.

793
00:42:54,246 --> 00:42:56,740
Oh, she's an older girl.

794
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,066
TALIESIN: I start peeling that thing open and try
to pull her out.

795
00:43:00,066 --> 00:43:01,102
LIAM: Make a strength check.

796
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:02,362
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

797
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:03,934
TALIESIN: It's fine! Help me!

798
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,012
TRAVIS: No!

799
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:06,350
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

800
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:12,783
LIAM: Natural 20! Okay, so you reach up as high up
as you can and you hang from it, and it just peels

801
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:23,675
open. And a teenager spills out, unconscious, long
red hair, flannel shirt. Unconscious.

802
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,063
TALIESIN: Matt, are you okay?

803
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,834
(laughing)

804
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:32,954
LIAM: There is another body further in. You see
just the barest glimpse of a Hawaiian shirt.

805
00:43:32,954 --> 00:43:36,055
(laughing)

806
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:39,509
TRAVIS: What does the hair look like?

807
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:47,552
TALIESIN: I'm coming to get you, Liam! Hold on!
I'm going to start pulling him out, too.

808
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:48,621
TRAVIS: You're going in there?

809
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:49,892
TALIESIN: Travis, help out!

810
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:50,769
TRAVIS: Okay!

811
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:51,954
LIAM: You're pulling who? Who are you pulling?

812
00:43:51,954 --> 00:43:53,134
TALIESIN: I'm pulling the Hawaiian shirt out of
there.

813
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:57,348
LIAM: You're pulling Hawaiian shirt? Well, he's
caught; his feet are caught up in the same--

814
00:43:57,348 --> 00:44:00,528
TALIESIN: I'm going to start using the stick to
wedge him out.

815
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:04,135
LIAM: You're going to use a stick? All right. I'm
going to give you no advantage for that roll. A

816
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:05,111
strength check.

817
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:06,245
TALIESIN: That's fine. No advantage?

818
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,244
LIAM: No advantage.

819
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,245
TALIESIN: That's fine. Just a strength roll?

820
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,197
LIAM: Strength roll.

821
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:11,435
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter, it's just a d20, I
suppose. No plus? That's a one.

822
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:17,590
LIAM: Aw man, feeling so proud of yourself, so
brave, so strong, pulling that open, and now

823
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:23,126
you're just doing a little Looney Tunes. Your feet
are just scuttling in the slick wet of this swamp

824
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:24,757
and you're making no headway.

825
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:26,163
TRAVIS: Can I try to help him?

826
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:26,981
TALIESIN: Please.

827
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,225
LIAM: Sure, are you going to go catch up?

828
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:28,917
TRAVIS: Yeah.

829
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,322
LIAM: All right. You hear (splashes).

830
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:33,541
TALIESIN: I give up and roll down and try to wake
Marisha up.

831
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:38,478
LIAM: Okay. Oh, you give her a slap? Marisha, you
are woken out of your sleep

832
00:44:38,478 --> 00:44:39,834
getting slapped in the face.

833
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,298
MARISHA: I immediately grab his wrist.

834
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:42,382
LIAM: Yes, you do.

835
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:44,767
TALIESIN: Wake up, there's a lot going on!

836
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,366
MARISHA: Who the fuck? What is--

837
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:50,146
TALIESIN: Mr. Mom. You know exactly who I am.

838
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,405
MARISHA: Oh, you're from my future!

839
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:57,207
TALIESIN: Now I'm really confused. Hi.

840
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:58,221
MARISHA: Hi.

841
00:44:58,221 --> 00:44:59,340
TALIESIN: It's Taliesin.

842
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,315
MARISHA: It's Marisha.

843
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:01,694
TALIESIN: You're a teenager.

844
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:06,965
MARISHA: (brokenly) No! Not again!

845
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:11,679
LIAM: The last thing you remember is falling
asleep, resting your head on your keyboard in your

846
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,800
office at Geek and Sundry.

847
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,078
SAM: Listening to Moana.

848
00:45:17,078 --> 00:45:21,711
MARISHA: You're welcome. What? Who? Huh?

849
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:26,777
TALIESIN: I point at the Hawaiian shirt and
Travis. Are you pulling by this point? There's a

850
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:31,418
lot going on. I don't know. Help.

851
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:35,280
LIAM: Marisha, you look over and see a face very
much like one you've seen in many photographs

852
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,532
dressed as Sephiroth, except with glasses and a
Hawaiian shirt and just so peaceful and sweet.

853
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,714
Asleep.

854
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:47,590
MARISHA: Oh, it's glasses Matt! Oh my god!

855
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,969
TRAVIS: Does he have any facial hair?

856
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:50,398
MATT: What age is this, about?

857
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:54,776
LIAM: 12, 13, 14? 12?

858
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:58,540
MATT: Okay, so yeah, glasses, nearing a mullet.

859
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,275
MARISHA: Yeah, nearing mullets phase.

860
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:05,617
MATT: And it looks like a Hawaiian shirt. It's
more like a bowling shirt with a cool-looking

861
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:06,932
anime dragon on it.

862
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,843
LAURA: Dragon Ball Z bowling shirt!

863
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:09,846
MATT: Yeah.

864
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:12,100
LIAM: Why don't you guys all open your manilla
envelopes.

865
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:20,251
(cheering)

866
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:22,361
SAM: Ooh! So cute!

867
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:34,216
(laughter)

868
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:35,899
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

869
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,340
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

870
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:38,723
MATT: That's straight up.

871
00:46:38,723 --> 00:46:39,970
TALIESIN: Liam, that's so solid!

872
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,807
TRAVIS: Marisha's a badass bitch!

873
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:44,083
TALIESIN: I know exactly what picture they used
for this!

874
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,877
MARISHA: I'm in Kentucky at this phase!

875
00:46:46,877 --> 00:46:50,688
LAURA: Ah, yeah. Aw, Hawaiian shirt Matt!

876
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:55,362
MATT: Yeah. That's about as accurate as you'll ever
get.

877
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:56,835
ASHLEY: This is the best.

878
00:46:56,893 --> 00:46:58,288
MARISHA: Taliesin!

879
00:46:58,288 --> 00:47:00,164
ASHLEY: Why didn't we know each other as kids?

880
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:01,889
MARISHA: You look like a Ralph Bakshi cartoon!

881
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,058
LAURA: You're so cute!

882
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:04,465
MATT: Oh, Travis!

883
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:11,227
TRAVIS: Just not sure of anything! My mom gave me
this shirt.

884
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:12,787
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

885
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:16,893
LIAM: Like the Grinch, my heart just grew two
sizes in my chest.

886
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:19,001
(laughing)

887
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:24,871
LIAM: A couple of minutes pass and the rest of you
catch up. You two are still-- your feet are glued

888
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:26,647
into this plant.

889
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:29,036
MARISHA: Fists, bra?

890
00:47:29,036 --> 00:47:37,063
LIAM: You're glued into place and you're sizing
each other up and you can tell fairly quickly--

891
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:41,668
you don't know how old everyone is, but who the
oldest is, who the youngest is. Marisha is taller

892
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:50,802
than anyone here, clearly mid-to-late teens. Under
her, maybe Ashley, Laura and Matt kind of in the

893
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:56,109
same zone. It's hard to say between Sam and
Taliesin.

894
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:59,217
TALIESIN: I was a tiny child. I was a tiny, tiny
child.

895
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:00,707
SAM: We were theater children.

896
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,215
LAURA: I also was very small.

897
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:04,786
SAM: So, eight, nine-ish? Maybe?

898
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:06,710
LIAM: Yeah, ish.

899
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:13,553
MARISHA: Why are all the girls more developed? Is
this indicative of puberty? Is this a statement?

900
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:15,060
LAURA: Our mental state?

901
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,832
LIAM: Art is open to interpretation, Marisha.

902
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:22,553
LAURA: I'm down two hit points! I've only got
eight hit points!

903
00:48:22,553 --> 00:48:25,778
LIAM: Not anymore. Oh, now you do. From ten to
eight.

904
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,736
LAURA: No, no, I had eight.

905
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:29,213
LIAM: You had eight and now you're at six?

906
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:29,911
LAURA: Yeah.

907
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,018
LIAM: Better be careful.

908
00:48:31,018 --> 00:48:32,359
LAURA: Jeez Louise, Liam.

909
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,524
LIAM: You guys are in the middle of--

910
00:48:34,524 --> 00:48:36,042
MARISHA: How many hit points do I have?

911
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,429
LIAM: It doesn't say?

912
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:38,518
MARISHA: No.

913
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:42,946
LIAM: You've got, let's say nine.

914
00:48:42,946 --> 00:48:44,086
MARISHA: Nine.

915
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,159
LIAM: Because you're so tall.

916
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,061
LAURA: What do you have?

917
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,212
ASHLEY: 11.

918
00:48:47,212 --> 00:48:49,294
LAURA: (gasps) You have a high constitution.

919
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:54,141
ASHLEY: Because I've always been a little tough as
fuck.

920
00:48:54,141 --> 00:49:01,067
LIAM: Anyway. Guys, you are in the middle of a
very alien jungle. You don't know where the fuck

921
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:05,786
you are, you don't know what is going on, you
don't know why you are children. What are you

922
00:49:05,786 --> 00:49:07,838
going to do? Are you going to build a house and
live here?

923
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,071
SAM: I guess so. Wait, are we together again?

924
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:12,837
LAURA: Did we catch up?

925
00:49:12,837 --> 00:49:15,100
LIAM: Yeah, everyone is here. Is Matt sleeping?

926
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,198
MARISHA: Wait, is he not alive?

927
00:49:16,198 --> 00:49:17,781
LAURA: He's not out of the flower yet.

928
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:19,074
MATT: I'm still inside the flower.

929
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:22,183
MARISHA: Oh, right. Okay. I'll go over and be
like, yo.

930
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:24,247
MATT: Huh? What?

931
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:26,239
MARISHA: We're kids!

932
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,414
ASHLEY: Hey, Matt!

933
00:49:28,414 --> 00:49:29,925
MATT: I don't like this nightmare.

934
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,409
(laughter)

935
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:32,678
MATT: What?

936
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,578
MARISHA: This is real!

937
00:49:34,578 --> 00:49:36,765
TRAVIS: Can I see your glasses?

938
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,873
MATT: Sure.

939
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:43,566
LIAM: Matt, apparently three Monster energy drinks
are not enough to keep you awake working on the

940
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:50,516
campaign book and you pass out on your desktop at
home. That's the last thing you remember. And you

941
00:49:50,516 --> 00:49:51,691
were tall.

942
00:49:51,691 --> 00:49:54,501
MATT: So I'm taking my glasses off, I'm like,
okay, so--

943
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:57,173
LAURA: Oh, I can still see!

944
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:58,953
MATT: What? I can't!

945
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:01,124
(laughter)

946
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:07,725
MATT: I'm going to keep-- and I look down, am I
still in this giant Audrey II-type plant?

947
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:09,275
LIAM: You can sit up, that's about it.

948
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,724
MATT: Oh jeez! (yells)

949
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:15,496
LAURA: Can we try to pull the flower back?

950
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:17,208
LIAM: Yeah, sure, you can pull.

951
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,889
MARISHA: Me and Ashley (straining noises).

952
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:22,636
LIAM: Matt, make a strength check at advantage.

953
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,339
MATT: They do it?

954
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:27,209
LIAM: No, just you. Because you're pushing to--

955
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:28,816
SAM and LAURA: Just Matt.

956
00:50:28,816 --> 00:50:29,769
MARISHA: Oh.

957
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:30,720
MATT: She got a ten.

958
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,461
LIAM: Thanks, Keyleth.

959
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:34,450
MARISHA: Different universe! Different one!

960
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,150
MATT: That's a 19.

961
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,949
LIAM: That's fine. You explode out of this
motherfucker like Superman and jump and land on

962
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:46,773
your feet in the middle of the muck, full of
adrenaline, and you have no idea what to do.

963
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:49,387
MATT: That was the coolest thing I ever did at
this age, guys. I'm glad you

964
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:51,015
were here to witness it.

965
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,454
ASHLEY: Matt.

966
00:50:52,454 --> 00:50:53,647
MATT: What?

967
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:56,555
ASHLEY: You look fucking rad.

968
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:58,372
(laughing)

969
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:04,764
MATT: Okay, that's the coolest thing to happen to
me at this age. This was not a good age, actually.

970
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,457
I really don't--

971
00:51:06,457 --> 00:51:12,885
SAM: Something's going on. We're in a weird forest
swamp. There are weird demon dogs that are

972
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:13,836
attacking us--

973
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:14,876
LAURA: It was a cat!

974
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:15,671
SAM: Was it?

975
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:16,362
LAURA: Yeah.

976
00:51:16,362 --> 00:51:17,341
TRAVIS: Naked and hairless.

977
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,488
LAURA: It was hairless. Oh, Ashley's got it,
still.

978
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:21,221
ASHLEY: It's on my belt.

979
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:23,443
MATT: That's skinless. That's skinless!

980
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:27,013
LAURA: Yeah! Look around, we're in giant fucking
plants. We're fucked!

981
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:34,029
SAM: Yeah, everyone's freaking out and Travis has
reverted back to his behavior as a 15-year-old or

982
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:34,982
something.

983
00:51:34,982 --> 00:51:37,026
LAURA: Travis has been mentally brought back to
that age as well.

984
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:39,891
SAM: We're all normal-thinking, but not Travis.

985
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:41,876
(laughter)

986
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:44,175
LIAM: It's a coping mechanism.

987
00:51:44,175 --> 00:51:46,858
MATT: You spent far too long roleplaying as Grog,
and it's starting to rub off onto him.

988
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:48,114
TRAVIS: Everything's dangerous!

989
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:49,451
(laughter)

990
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:54,224
ASHLEY: You know what's really cool about this,
though? Okay, I'm going to try to explain this,

991
00:51:54,224 --> 00:51:57,294
what's happening in my brain, but right now --

992
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:58,824
MARISHA: Nah, it's 420. We're cool.

993
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,375
ASHLEY: Okay. That's true.

994
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,978
MARISHA: Yeah, we're with it. Yeah.

995
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:06,858
ASHLEY: We all have friends right now. Because in
real life, when I was this age, I didn't have

996
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:10,455
friends. And now, look, we all have friends!

997
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:14,853
MARISHA: Holy shit! Guys, why didn't we know each
other when we were all this age?

998
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:16,479
TRAVIS: Because we lived in different states.

999
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:17,484
MARISHA: That sucks.

1000
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:18,632
(laughter)

1001
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:19,720
LAURA: There's that.

1002
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,172
TALIESIN: A few of us were working all the time.

1003
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,351
SAM: Yeah, I was on Broadway.

1004
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:23,562
LAURA: Right.

1005
00:52:23,562 --> 00:52:27,209
MATT: Yeah, I didn't have friends. I helped people
with homework and then they said thank you.

1006
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:28,359
TALIESIN: So nice of you.

1007
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:32,183
MARISHA: I was covering for friends' drug habits,
so that's fine.

1008
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,347
SAM: Dark.

1009
00:52:33,347 --> 00:52:35,347
TRAVIS: I was melting action figures.

1010
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:37,697
LAURA: I was in the science club!

1011
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,406
(laughter)

1012
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,124
LAURA: Odyssey of the Mind!

1013
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:44,912
LIAM: Somewhere in the distance you hear (angry
cat noises)

1014
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,921
LAURA: Oh shit.

1015
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:46,895
SAM: More cats.

1016
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:48,426
TRAVIS: Is there a sun?

1017
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:55,458
LIAM: There is. Definitely, right where you are,
because again the trees opened up, the sky's a

1018
00:52:55,458 --> 00:53:02,378
little dimmer than you're used to. It's got sort
of a dusk feel to it. It's darker, but it's

1019
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,332
day-ish.

1020
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:08,583
LAURA: How did they get in here? How did you get
in here?

1021
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,501
ASHLEY: Does anybody remember anything?

1022
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,562
LAURA: Does anybody see anything?

1023
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:16,846
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we were fighting Conan O'Brien
and then we got pushed forward in time. That's all

1024
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:19,094
I remember. And also, Travis tried to kill me.

1025
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,649
MARISHA: Wait, we got pushed forward in time?

1026
00:53:20,649 --> 00:53:27,293
TALIESIN: Pushed in time? You guys were there!

1027
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:33,165
MARISHA: We came from the future, though, right?
DM?

1028
00:53:33,165 --> 00:53:34,726
LIAM: Well, I'm not here.

1029
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:37,164
TRAVIS: No, we saw you, you were there! You rode
in--

1030
00:53:37,164 --> 00:53:38,932
LIAM: You came from the Geek and Sundry offices.

1031
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:42,206
TRAVIS: We saw you, you rode in on this sweet
Harley and you looked like you were from the Mad

1032
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:46,317
Max time period and you were all badass. Not like
you look right now.

1033
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:47,893
LAURA: Like, super badass.

1034
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:54,898
MARISHA: I mean, it sounds within the realm of
something I'd do, but I don't have any--

1035
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,645
TRAVIS: You don't have a motorcycle parked behind
the--

1036
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:57,499
LAURA: You don't remember that?

1037
00:53:57,499 --> 00:53:58,439
MARISHA: No.

1038
00:53:58,439 --> 00:53:59,476
TRAVIS: Huh, okay.

1039
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:01,391
MARISHA: Matt actually said I wasn't allowed to
have a motorcycle.

1040
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:03,789
MATT: I did say that.

1041
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:06,815
MARISHA: He's afraid I might kill myself.

1042
00:54:06,815 --> 00:54:09,142
SAM: Well, you will, statistically speaking.

1043
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:12,435
MATT: Yeah, that's why I said no! She's supposed
to live a long time.

1044
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:16,856
ASHLEY: Did we actually get together for dinner?
And then we just took drugs for some reason?

1045
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:17,948
SAM: No.

1046
00:54:17,948 --> 00:54:19,045
TRAVIS: No?

1047
00:54:19,045 --> 00:54:22,772
LAURA: We were recording and then we fought Conan
O'Brien--

1048
00:54:22,772 --> 00:54:24,642
MATT: Guys! Scary creature animal sound--

1049
00:54:24,642 --> 00:54:26,431
SAM: We need weapons, we need somewhere to go.

1050
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,078
LAURA: Did you see anything--

1051
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:29,272
TRAVIS: Nope!

1052
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:30,657
ASHLEY: The rock seemed to do well.

1053
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:32,333
TALIESIN: There was that booming sound earlier.

1054
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,898
MATT: Can I search around? I want to see if
there's anything that could be possibly used as a

1055
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:34,966
weapon.

1056
00:54:34,966 --> 00:54:36,508
LIAM: Absolutely you can.

1057
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:39,083
MARISHA: Did you sound like that at that age? Were
you always--

1058
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:42,499
MATT: What, an obnoxious annoying kid? Yeah,
totally!

1059
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:47,534
LIAM: There is no shortage of vines and trees and
rocks. If anyone wants to look for something, if

1060
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,070
you want to break it off a tree, they'll be
stronger if you break it right off a tree

1061
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,664
probably, but they're around.

1062
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:55,878
MARISHA: I'm going to try and break off a sweet
staff from a tree branch.

1063
00:54:55,878 --> 00:55:02,385
LIAM: Well, they're wet and taut.

1064
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:04,240
TALIESIN: Turgid.

1065
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,720
LIAM: Turgid, yes.

1066
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,705
LAURA: I want to break off a few sticks and try to
turn them into sharp daggery sword things. That's

1067
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:13,087
fine, I'll be covered.

1068
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:19,758
LIAM: You, Marisha, as you tear down a huge chunk,
are just Carrie'd. Just (squishing noise) as you

1069
00:55:19,758 --> 00:55:27,087
rip it off. When you break, whatever sap or
whatever it is that's in there feels hot and is

1070
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:30,819
dark red and it spatters you. So you are now
blooded.

1071
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:32,433
LAURA: Does it smell like blood?

1072
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:37,364
MARISHA: Is it blood? Yeah, I'm going to smell it
and do a little bit of a taste test.

1073
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:39,527
LIAM: You want to make a nature check?

1074
00:55:39,527 --> 00:55:40,893
MARISHA: Is that what I do? I don't know!

1075
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:42,046
LIAM: Sure, why not.

1076
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,589
MARISHA: I'm not a druid in this life!

1077
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:46,911
LAURA: Yeah, but you know how druids work,
Marisha.

1078
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:49,500
MARISHA: That's true, right? 15.

1079
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,824
LIAM: I mean, you have cut yourself in the past,
you have sucked on a cut, and it does taste kind

1080
00:55:54,824 --> 00:55:58,430
of like that. It is warm.

1081
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,836
LAURA: Is it blood?

1082
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:02,936
MARISHA: It's warm. It tastes like bad soup.

1083
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:07,859
MATT: What if everybody else we've ever known was
turned into a tree and we're in a jungle pulling

1084
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:09,783
their fingers off?

1085
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:15,272
LIAM: In the direction that you guys have come
from, you hear (fluttering noises).

1086
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:17,693
SAM: Oh god. I'm going to just grab a handful of
rocks.

1087
00:56:17,693 --> 00:56:18,930
LAURA: I'm going to hide.

1088
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,617
MATT: I'm going to grab Taliesin and wield him as
a weapon.

1089
00:56:21,617 --> 00:56:22,450
TALIESIN: Hey!

1090
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,484
LIAM: Are you?

1091
00:56:23,484 --> 00:56:24,667
MATT: Yeah.

1092
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,080
TALIESIN: I'll go with it, and I have the stick,
I'm just going to be like--

1093
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,112
LAURA: I'm going to hide behind the flower that
Matt came out of.

1094
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:34,030
LIAM: Okay, so you guys are all finding hiding
places?

1095
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,964
MARISHA: Oh, we're hiding?

1096
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:38,693
MATT: I don't until everyone else starts--

1097
00:56:38,693 --> 00:56:40,170
LIAM: It's getting closer.

1098
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,379
LAURA: I hide.

1099
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:42,738
LIAM: It's multiple locations, too.

1100
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,171
MARISHA: Can I climb the tree that I broke off?

1101
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,559
LIAM: Sure, make an athletics check.

1102
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:46,893
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

1103
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:49,418
LIAM: At disadvantage because it's sopping wet.

1104
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:51,202
MARISHA: Well, it's a one.

1105
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:56,295
LIAM: Okay, you slide and fall right back down and
smack your head on a rock and you take one hit

1106
00:56:56,295 --> 00:56:57,585
point of damage.

1107
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,777
MATT: I immediately drop Taliesin and rush over to
make sure she's okay.

1108
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:02,534
MARISHA: No, don't! I'm fine!

1109
00:57:02,534 --> 00:57:04,592
LIAM: Okay, Taliesin, you take one hit point of
damage as you hit your head

1110
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,105
on a rock on the ground.

1111
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:08,224
SAM: I'm going to hide in a creek.

1112
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,728
MATT: Just like when I was 12, I can't do anything
right!

1113
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,396
MARISHA: Jesus, don't try to fix it! Just don't
try to fix it!

1114
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:20,460
LIAM: There is six, seven-- you're hiding? Okay,
make a stealth check.

1115
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,900
SAM: I'm hiding, as well.

1116
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,278
LIAM: Make a stealth check.

1117
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:26,354
TALIESIN: You're really enjoying this way too
much.

1118
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:29,040
LAURA: 22.

1119
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,479
LIAM: 22.

1120
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:31,497
TALIESIN: Six.

1121
00:57:31,497 --> 00:57:32,627
LIAM: Six?

1122
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:33,748
SAM: Three.

1123
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:34,706
LIAM: Three.

1124
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:37,516
TALIESIN: Which is about what I could get
hired to play at that age.

1125
00:57:37,577 --> 00:57:44,335
LIAM: Okay, you sneak behind, you rogue, you, you
sneak behind the giant plant and get right

1126
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:49,022
underneath the leaf again, and you reach out and
grab Taliesin and yank him with you. And Sam says,

1127
00:57:49,022 --> 00:57:54,213
"Wait, what about me?" just as these things go
(exploding noise) and break out of the tree cover,

1128
00:57:54,213 --> 00:58:00,858
and there are six or seven of these little ropy
skinless cats, running at you at full speed,

1129
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:05,560
crossing the water. They're coming. Standing our
ground?

1130
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:13,289
TRAVIS: I'm fucking out again, just booking ass.
Running like the wind, like Forrest Gump coming

1131
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,189
out of them leg braces!

1132
00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:22,200
LIAM: Taliesin, from your hiding point, you see
Travis just book it in the same direction as the

1133
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,839
weird old man went, running off through the tree
cover, he's gone.

1134
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:33,328
MATT: As he starts running, can I use Friends to
try and ask him to not leave?

1135
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:34,475
SAM: You have spells?

1136
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:35,495
LAURA: Wait, you have spells?

1137
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:36,718
MARISHA: He's a bard!

1138
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:39,368
LIAM: You can really implore him to stay, which
means yes.

1139
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:44,334
MATT: Okay. So I'm going to go ahead-- actually, I
don't have time, since he's going to bolt. Instead

1140
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,260
I'm just going to go ahead and use a persuasion
check.

1141
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,131
LIAM: Okay.

1142
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:52,045
MATT: I'll try and persuade him. So I say, Travis
don't go, please! You leave now, we all die! We

1143
00:58:52,045 --> 00:59:00,151
need you! Now's the time to become the man you
eventually will be!

1144
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:03,123
LIAM: Siri, what would we he roll against this?
Wisdom?

1145
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,659
MATT: This would be my persuasion--

1146
00:59:05,659 --> 00:59:08,432
LIAM: Wisdom, right?

1147
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,485
MATT: It's really up to you. If he wants to resist
it, then yeah.

1148
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:12,157
LIAM: Yeah, let's just go fast and say wisdom.

1149
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:13,454
MATT: Sure.

1150
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:16,494
TRAVIS: I'm out.

1151
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:17,505
MATT: 23.

1152
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:18,378
TRAVIS: 22.

1153
00:59:18,378 --> 00:59:20,086
ALL: Oh!

1154
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:24,310
LIAM: You stop and put your hand on the tree
(panting). You breathe, and you stop where you

1155
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:30,764
are. You're still at this point 40 feet away from
the group and starting to cry. But you don't go.

1156
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:34,438
You feel too guilty because you spent five years
playing Dungeons and Dragons with these people.

1157
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:38,043
You cannot leave them alone to die. Everybody roll
for initiative.

1158
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:40,025
SAM: Oh my god.

1159
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:42,642
MATT: Oh! Natural 20!

1160
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:44,090
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1161
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,381
MARISHA: What?

1162
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,330
MATT: That's crazy! I'm sitting in Taliesin's
seat. I just realized!

1163
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,249
TALIESIN: Damn it!

1164
00:59:49,249 --> 00:59:51,966
LIAM: Okay, who got 15 to 20?

1165
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:54,855
MARISHA: Hang on, are we rolling initiative?

1166
00:59:54,855 --> 00:59:55,702
LIAM: Yeah, man!

1167
00:59:55,702 --> 00:59:56,920
MARISHA: I got distracted, sorry!

1168
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,132
MATT: Ooh, a 19.

1169
00:59:58,132 --> 01:00:00,089
MARISHA: 22.

1170
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:01,206
LIAM: 22?

1171
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:02,262
MATT: 22.

1172
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:03,455
LIAM: All right. Okay.

1173
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,627
TALIESIN: 19.

1174
01:00:04,627 --> 01:00:06,218
LIAM: 19. Damn, guys.

1175
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:08,351
TALIESIN: Because of negative one.

1176
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:10,249
LIAM: All right, ten to 15?

1177
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:11,673
SAM: 14.

1178
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:15,596
LIAM: Okay. Laura, Travis, Ashley, where you at?

1179
01:00:15,596 --> 01:00:16,833
LAURA: Five!

1180
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:17,823
TRAVIS: Four.

1181
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,852
ASHLEY: Six!

1182
01:00:18,852 --> 01:00:32,621
LIAM: Okay. All right, these things are-- here we
go. Tree cover! Travis, little boy Travis, has run

1183
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:44,596
that far. Are we on camera, guys? We've got Laura
and Taliesin-- yeah, that's right. Hidden. Not

1184
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:51,630
hidden. Standing their ground. It's got to be this
way. Oh, I got it backwards! There we go. And here

1185
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,373
they come, guys.

1186
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:54,954
SAM: This is it.

1187
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:58,822
LIAM: (sings) This is just like how I do it with
my kids! And you are kids!

1188
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:05,425
LAURA: Oh my god, there's so many of them, we're
all going to die.

1189
01:01:05,425 --> 01:01:09,200
LIAM: Okay, Marisha. What do you want to do?

1190
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,751
MARISHA: Oh, it's me up first?

1191
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:11,614
LIAM: Yes.

1192
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:12,710
SAM: Which one is she?

1193
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,040
LIAM: Marisha's right here.

1194
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,007
SAM: Okay.

1195
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:16,857
LIAM: Yeah, you're not color-coded, so I'll have
to help out a little bit.

1196
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:24,184
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn and I'm going to
look at everybody else, and be like, we're fucking

1197
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,796
up these cats, yeah?

1198
01:01:25,796 --> 01:01:26,555
SAM: Yeah!

1199
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:27,434
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1200
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:31,722
MARISHA: Okay! And then I'm going to run forward
to the one that's closest to me there.

1201
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,997
LIAM: Three, four, five, six, that's where you're
at.

1202
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:35,441
MARISHA: That's it? That's all I got?

1203
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,456
LIAM: That's it.

1204
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:39,930
MARISHA: Okay. And then I'm going to be like,
argh! (crying noises)

1205
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,731
LIAM: All righty, you're an angry teen.

1206
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,702
MARISHA: I'm angry, all hormonal rage!

1207
01:01:43,702 --> 01:01:45,238
MATT: You still have your action and your bonus.

1208
01:01:45,238 --> 01:01:46,155
LIAM: Yeah.

1209
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:47,638
MARISHA: I don't have anything I can do, though.

1210
01:01:47,638 --> 01:01:51,426
MATT: Actually, as a monk, you should be able to
use--

1211
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,810
LIAM: At level one.

1212
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,001
MATT: At level one--

1213
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:58,482
MARISHA: I have unarmed strike as a bonus action,
but that's all that's on my sheet.

1214
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:07,008
MATT: That's true. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. You can
still use an action if you wanted to go into your

1215
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:09,446
dodge action, which any attacks against you--

1216
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:10,616
SAM: No DMing!

1217
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:11,739
MATT: I'm helping out!

1218
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,636
LIAM: Hey, man, I'm not complaining! Shut up!

1219
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:17,695
MATT: Anyone can use their action to make a dodge
action, so instead of attacking, you basically

1220
01:02:17,695 --> 01:02:20,540
just get really defensive, and then attacks
against you have disadvantage.

1221
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,447
LIAM: So you're just getting ready for it. That's
a good idea.

1222
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,666
MARISHA: Oh, sure. I'm super ready for these
cats.

1223
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:34,649
LIAM: Okay. D for dodge! Matt, what would you like
to do? You're right here.

1224
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:38,469
SAM: He's going to cast 5th-level Explode Cats.

1225
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:45,871
MATT: I'm going to move ahead, and start getting
closer to back up Marisha. But I'm going to move a

1226
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:53,123
little bit behind her because she's tougher than I
am. And that one that's kind of off to the right,

1227
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:59,314
that one right there, I look over as I approach
and be like: Hey cat! Have you seen the kind of

1228
01:02:59,314 --> 01:03:03,605
shit she can do? Oh look, your friend over there,
he went ahead and fell down already. He was twice

1229
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:06,787
as big as you! You're going to die in a second,
fool! I was going to use

1230
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,432
Vicious Mockery on that guy.

1231
01:03:08,432 --> 01:03:09,250
LIAM: Okay.

1232
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,386
SAM: Vicious Mockery.

1233
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,415
ASHLEY: Yes!

1234
01:03:11,415 --> 01:03:15,456
MATT: So, let's see. Has to make a wisdom saving
throw.

1235
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:17,843
LIAM: Okay. What's the DC?

1236
01:03:17,843 --> 01:03:23,078
MATT: It's not on my sheet. But that would be,
with the math there-- proficiency bonus of plus

1237
01:03:23,078 --> 01:03:28,553
two, plus my charisma which is three, so the DC
would be 13.

1238
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:31,320
LIAM: Well, fuck you, 'cause he got a natural 20.

1239
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,933
MATT: That's okay. That happens.

1240
01:03:35,933 --> 01:03:37,579
LIAM: That's okay. Okay.

1241
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:43,713
MATT: I'm like, mocking cats is a bad idea. Save
me! Can I use the rest of my movement to stand

1242
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:45,086
directly behind Marisha?

1243
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:47,291
LIAM: Okay, I'll give you one more. Taliesin,
you're up.

1244
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:53,124
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek around and see all
this and take a look at what's going down here.

1245
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,669
LIAM: Okay.

1246
01:03:55,669 --> 01:04:03,824
TALIESIN: And the one that's closest to Matt and
Marisha? I have some vague memories of where we

1247
01:04:03,824 --> 01:04:05,051
just came from.

1248
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:06,118
LIAM: Yeah.

1249
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:07,934
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if any of this still
works?

1250
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:08,846
LIAM: Yeah.

1251
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,498
TALIESIN: Do I have any of that weird--

1252
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:12,244
LIAM: Are you a haunted kid, is that what you're
asking me?

1253
01:04:12,244 --> 01:04:13,487
TALIESIN: I mean, I was already--

1254
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,646
LIAM: You are a fucking haunted kid!

1255
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:16,891
(laughter)

1256
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:18,173
LIAM: What do you want to do?

1257
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:22,756
TALIESIN: I want to reach down into the ground,
and see if I can just-- I'm just going to try and

1258
01:04:22,956 --> 01:04:29,500
reach out at that first cat and see if I can hit
it with a little bit of the Chill Touch. I want to

1259
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,333
see if I can make those tendrils form again.

1260
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,951
LIAM: All right. Talk to me, Goose.

1261
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:36,383
TALIESIN: Chill Touch on the closest cat to the
two kids.

1262
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:39,666
LIAM: Okay, this one right here?

1263
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,133
TALIESIN: Yep, that one.

1264
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:48,692
LIAM: That is definitely within range of your goth
attitude. Okay! So you've got to make a ranged

1265
01:04:48,692 --> 01:04:49,994
spell attack?

1266
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:51,191
TALIESIN: Yep.

1267
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,536
LIAM: Go for it.

1268
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:57,023
TALIESIN: I don't actually know how to do this
anymore. Where's my spell--

1269
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,998
LIAM: Plus five, just roll plus five.

1270
01:04:58,998 --> 01:05:00,684
TALIESIN: 18.

1271
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:07,746
LIAM: 18 does in fact hit, so you slam your little
tiny cherub hand into the ground and it sinks into

1272
01:05:07,746 --> 01:05:14,561
the mud, and you feel the dark power of your
overlord slide down into the ground, and a

1273
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:18,939
split-second happens, and it goes (electric sound)
out of the ground, underneath this thing, and

1274
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:24,732
tendrils, spectral purplish-black tendrils wrap
around it and yank it into the ground! And it is

1275
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:26,136
fucking gone!

1276
01:05:26,136 --> 01:05:27,570
(cheering)

1277
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:31,650
TALIESIN: (heavy breathing) Cool!

1278
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,928
LIAM: None of you motherfuckers can do what
Taliesin just did. Sam, you're up!

1279
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:36,598
SAM: Me? Which one am I?

1280
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:40,509
LIAM: You are in the luchador pants, right here.

1281
01:05:40,509 --> 01:05:45,482
SAM: Okay, I go forward and to the left. Am I
within throwing range?

1282
01:05:45,482 --> 01:05:52,667
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.
For throwing a rock?

1283
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:56,840
SAM: Yeah. I can hold my action until they get in
range.

1284
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,054
LIAM: Sure, you want to wait until one gets close
enough, and then chuck a rock?

1285
01:06:00,054 --> 01:06:01,003
SAM: Yes.

1286
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,146
LIAM: Sure. Done.

1287
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:04,377
SAM: I will get ready. I'll cock my hand.

1288
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,618
LIAM: Cock a rock. Cock rock.

1289
01:06:06,618 --> 01:06:07,654
SAM: Cock rock.

1290
01:06:07,654 --> 01:06:09,132
LIAM: Okay, Ashley. You're up.

1291
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:16,315
ASHLEY: Okay! I'm going to take the dead skinned
cat from my belt and hold it by the tail, and say,

1292
01:06:16,315 --> 01:06:19,854
(shouting) All right, you motherfuckers! You
better turn around and leave or I'm going to kill

1293
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:24,548
every last motherfucking one of you! I'm going to
intimidate them.

1294
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:25,844
LIAM: Intimidate, okay.

1295
01:06:25,844 --> 01:06:27,235
SAM: They're cats.

1296
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:30,829
ASHLEY: (shouting) I don't care if they're just
cats!

1297
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:34,328
LIAM: Make an intimidation check at disadvantage.

1298
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:40,176
MATT: This is absolutely brilliant. Ooh! You're
rolling good tonight.

1299
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,512
TRAVIS: Disadvantage.

1300
01:06:41,512 --> 01:06:42,294
LAURA: Why?

1301
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:43,223
ASHLEY: With a disadvantage?

1302
01:06:43,223 --> 01:06:44,036
LIAM: Yeah.

1303
01:06:44,036 --> 01:06:44,910
ASHLEY: Why?

1304
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,716
LIAM: Because it's a herd of skinless--

1305
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:47,741
ASHLEY: I'm fucking--

1306
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,376
LAURA: Scary! She's really intimidating!

1307
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,124
MATT: Roll disadvantage, because he said it.

1308
01:06:52,124 --> 01:06:53,789
(laughter)

1309
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:55,426
SAM: It was a little standoff, there.

1310
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:58,474
MATT: That's okay. She rolled higher on the second
one.

1311
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:01,219
ASHLEY: 22.

1312
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:03,068
TALIESIN: Ooh!

1313
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:09,834
LIAM: (cats growling) They start backing up.

1314
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,047
SAM: All of them?

1315
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:20,060
LIAM: Slowly. The first three do. The first three
do stop in their tracks. The other three-- well

1316
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,248
you'll find out in a minute. Laura, what would you
like to do?

1317
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:29,315
LAURA: I'm going to hold my attack until one of
them comes closer.

1318
01:07:29,315 --> 01:07:31,440
LIAM: And how are you going to attack?

1319
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,205
LAURA: I have those two sharpened sticks like
daggers, yo!

1320
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:35,720
LIAM: Are they melee sticks?

1321
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,035
LAURA: Well, I mean, I suppose so, because I don't
know how to make a throwing stick.

1322
01:07:39,035 --> 01:07:41,418
LIAM: I think that's just called a stick.

1323
01:07:41,418 --> 01:07:42,414
LAURA: Yeah.

1324
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:43,405
LIAM: Okay. All right.

1325
01:07:43,405 --> 01:07:45,828
LAURA: But I want it to be sharp, I don't want to
just throw a stick at something.

1326
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:50,096
LIAM: Okay. Are you waiting until they're in
throwing range or until they're right up on you?

1327
01:07:50,096 --> 01:07:52,478
LAURA: No, I want to wait until--

1328
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:54,078
SAM: Where are you?

1329
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,278
LAURA: I'm under a leaf. We're hiding.

1330
01:07:56,278 --> 01:07:58,489
SAM: Oh, that's not going to get near you in the
next round.

1331
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:01,094
LAURA: They're not?

1332
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:03,836
SAM: You're a hundred feet away from them.

1333
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:09,193
LAURA: Well, fine, I'll run out there and back up
Ashley. I'll go stand next to Ashley.

1334
01:08:09,193 --> 01:08:12,151
LIAM: 30, 40, bust out-- okay, right there, boom.

1335
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:16,834
LAURA: And then I'll pull my sticks out and wait.
And wait until they get closer.

1336
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:22,681
LIAM: Okay. Travis, would you like to keep--- oh
no, you were convinced to run. Do you want to stay

1337
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,691
hiding here? Or do you want to go back?

1338
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:26,357
TRAVIS: Nah, I'll go back. I was convinced.

1339
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:29,015
LAURA: I've been shamed by Sam to come out of
fucking hiding.

1340
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:33,154
LIAM: So, just direct line back? And you can dash,
too, I mean you're way far back.

1341
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:35,128
LAURA: I've only got six health points right now,
bro.

1342
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:36,689
LIAM: You want to dash?

1343
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:44,400
TRAVIS: No. I'm going to use my action to reach in
and grab what is definitely all-white

1344
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,647
tighty-whiteys, and I'm going to rip the elastic
band off of my briefs--

1345
01:08:48,647 --> 01:08:50,097
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

1346
01:08:50,097 --> 01:08:51,717
LAURA: Are you going to rage?

1347
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:57,394
TRAVIS: I'm going to pull the elastic band off and
prepare to, I don't know. (laughs)

1348
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:58,500
SAM: To strangle?

1349
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,944
TRAVIS: Yes, to strangle.

1350
01:08:59,944 --> 01:09:04,987
LIAM: Chances are so small, but I want you to roll
just in case you get a one.

1351
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:08,505
TRAVIS: It's a 12.

1352
01:09:08,505 --> 01:09:12,777
LIAM: Those tighty-whiteys rip out of your hands
and you crouch down, and you've got like a piano

1353
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:20,519
wire, except it's your underwear. And you're
ready. Okay. So these three don't leave, but they

1354
01:09:20,519 --> 01:09:27,711
back up to about here. They're still barely past
the edge of the tree. These ones are still coming,

1355
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:34,125
they didn't give a shit. One, two, three, four,
five, six, and he's going to dash and get right up

1356
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,257
on you--

1357
01:09:35,257 --> 01:09:37,060
SAM: Is that within throwing range for me?

1358
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:37,947
LIAM: Yes.

1359
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:38,881
SAM: I'm throwing!

1360
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:40,977
LIAM: All right, throw! Make a ranged attack.

1361
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,089
SAM: One.

1362
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:43,718
(laughter)

1363
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:46,695
SAM: Oh no, do I hit Marisha, or something?

1364
01:09:46,695 --> 01:09:50,473
LIAM: You do, actually. It conks off the back of
your head--

1365
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:52,611
MARISHA: Ow.

1366
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:53,732
SAM: Sorry!

1367
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:57,155
LIAM: Roll a d4.

1368
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:58,452
MARISHA: You are!

1369
01:09:58,452 --> 01:10:01,327
SAM: Three.

1370
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:03,097
LIAM: Three? What's your strength modifier?

1371
01:10:03,097 --> 01:10:06,634
SAM: I don't know. Oh, one.

1372
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:11,222
LIAM: One, okay. You take four points of damage.
You are clocked hard.

1373
01:10:11,222 --> 01:10:14,570
MARISHA: Damn it! Dick!

1374
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,307
SAM: I'm sorry!

1375
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:17,491
MARISHA: Fucking hell!

1376
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:20,244
SAM: I'm a musical theater person!

1377
01:10:20,244 --> 01:10:23,431
MARISHA: My mom warned me about people like you!

1378
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:28,833
LIAM: These are just going for the closest victim
they can find, but they're not close enough to actually

1379
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:35,793
attack. They make it up to there, they are
rounding on Marisha, and now it's Marisha's turn.

1380
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,977
MARISHA: Jesus, so I've got two kitty cats on me?

1381
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:41,131
LIAM: Three.

1382
01:10:41,131 --> 01:10:42,315
MARISHA: Three kitty cats?

1383
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:44,284
LAURA: They're really mean, Marisha! They have
claws!

1384
01:10:44,284 --> 01:10:52,395
MARISHA: Ugh! What? This is why you spay and
neuter your pets! And then I kick the one directly

1385
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:53,703
in front of me.

1386
01:10:53,703 --> 01:10:54,783
LIAM: Okay.

1387
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,516
MARISHA: Do I get a multiattack as a monk?

1388
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:58,334
LIAM: You get two attacks as a monk, yeah.

1389
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:02,448
MARISHA: I get two? Okay, I'm going to kick the
first one, just full on punt him, then I'm going

1390
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,904
to take the stick with the second one and give him
a big old golf swing.

1391
01:11:05,976 --> 01:11:07,871
LIAM: Okay, roll two attacks.

1392
01:11:07,871 --> 01:11:09,289
MARISHA: All right.

1393
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:11,294
MATT: See what's the first one, in case you kill
it.

1394
01:11:11,294 --> 01:11:16,464
MARISHA: First one? That's not great. 14 for the
first one.

1395
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:18,613
LIAM: This is the kick? Roll a d4.

1396
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:23,887
MARISHA: One plus three. Four points.

1397
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:28,976
LIAM: Okay, your foot takes this thing under the
chin and you just slick the bottom of your shoe

1398
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:36,694
and you feel a snap in your foot and it just does
a spin in the air and lands on its back, dead. But

1399
01:11:36,694 --> 01:11:39,697
you're still moving and smacking the next one.

1400
01:11:39,697 --> 01:11:46,663
MARISHA: Golf swing! Which is-- ooh, that's good,
that's 15 plus-- 21.

1401
01:11:46,663 --> 01:11:50,158
LIAM: Definitely hits. d4 plus strength.

1402
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:51,910
MARISHA: Five, total.

1403
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:57,991
LIAM: Okay, and you swing away and go crack and
this time you hit the thing's fucking head so hard

1404
01:11:57,991 --> 01:12:02,567
that you hear the same kind of snap, except you
feel tendon rip at the same time, and the head

1405
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:07,929
goes free except for this thin little band of
ligament, and it just falls and is still twitching

1406
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:10,046
and going (whimpering noises)

1407
01:12:10,046 --> 01:12:13,718
MATT: The first hit, behind her I go, nice! Second
one I go, no!

1408
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:15,699
MARISHA: I feel guilty.

1409
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:24,861
LIAM: Matt, you're up. And you've got a direct
view of blood dripping out the back of your young

1410
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:26,733
fiancée's head.

1411
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:35,007
MATT: Ooh, that's right. Well, there's the one
still next to her. All right, you know what, I'm

1412
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:47,063
going to go ahead and say: Don't worry, baby, I'll
take care of you! In about ten years! Or right

1413
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,683
now. We'll do that now! Healing Word.

1414
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:51,296
LIAM: Okay.

1415
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:54,217
MATT: Bonus action, so you heal five hit points.

1416
01:12:54,217 --> 01:12:56,058
ALL: Hey!

1417
01:12:56,058 --> 01:13:02,148
LIAM: Ugh, the back of your head stops smarting
like Advil, pronto, all healed up.

1418
01:13:02,148 --> 01:13:07,633
MARISHA: Man, you're so calming, just your
presence. So good.

1419
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,994
MATT: Thanks!

1420
01:13:08,994 --> 01:13:10,157
MARISHA: In ten years.

1421
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:12,733
MATT: I look over at the cat. As she's saying
this, the cat is in front of her going (snarling

1422
01:13:12,733 --> 01:13:15,264
noise). Okay, we're dead!

1423
01:13:15,264 --> 01:13:17,056
LIAM: (cat yowling)

1424
01:13:17,056 --> 01:13:20,589
MATT: I'm going to walk up and try and do what she
did, try and kick at it.

1425
01:13:20,589 --> 01:13:22,751
LIAM: Kick it? Okay, go for a roll.

1426
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:29,076
MATT: I move up base to base, right against her
shoulder, and just, (screams). Screaming, probably

1427
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:36,838
think I'm going to hurt myself more than the
creature, trying. And that is a four.

1428
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:46,242
LIAM: You do the most beautiful martial arts movie
spin kick that hits absolutely nothing, and come

1429
01:13:46,242 --> 01:13:51,402
back down and breathe heavy (panting) and look
over at the love of your life. Yeah.

1430
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:53,651
MATT: I'm proud of myself, because that looks just
like it does when I practice it

1431
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:55,579
when I'm home alone.

1432
01:13:55,579 --> 01:14:00,771
LIAM: Executive, you're up.

1433
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:05,291
TALIESIN: I see this one that's threatening. I'm
going to try and get a little more fancy with

1434
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:08,346
this. I'm just going to see if I can manifest the
power inside the cat.

1435
01:14:08,346 --> 01:14:10,039
LIAM: Inside the cat? Sure, go for it.

1436
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:15,901
TALIESIN: Yeah. Shooting, going for inside the
cat. It's already gross. That's right, I've got to

1437
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:18,184
learn this. 22.

1438
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:24,309
LIAM: Okay, so as Matt's foot comes down into the
water and goes (panting) you're right face-to-face

1439
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:30,264
with the thing. Its feral face is leaning up
against yours and it goes (yowls) and then three

1440
01:14:30,264 --> 01:14:36,676
spectral octopus tentacles come out of its face,
one out of each eye and one of its mouth, and you

1441
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:44,597
feel that shit just slathering all over your face
and sucks back in and the thing just explodes like

1442
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:48,087
a blood sausage. Gone.

1443
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,637
TALIESIN: Ooh. Okay.

1444
01:14:49,637 --> 01:14:55,186
MATT: When I turn around and see this tiny bowl
haircut blond kid from the Omen just glowing.

1445
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:59,653
LIAM: You look over your shoulder and you just see
that face.

1446
01:14:59,653 --> 01:15:03,400
MATT: Marisha, who are we fighting? I don't know
who we're fighting anymore!

1447
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,283
TALIESIN: We're good, we got this!

1448
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:06,297
MATT: Okay!

1449
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,663
MARISHA: That's Taliesin!

1450
01:15:07,663 --> 01:15:09,214
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

1451
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,597
SAM: It's my turn? Oh, it's my turn again. We've
cycled around?

1452
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:12,977
LIAM: Yep.

1453
01:15:12,977 --> 01:15:16,630
SAM: Okay. Are those guys out of range?

1454
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,727
LIAM: Just, but you could get in range.

1455
01:15:19,727 --> 01:15:24,679
SAM: All right, I'm going to try to right my
wrongs and get in range and throw another rock at

1456
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:26,890
the middle one.

1457
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,334
LIAM: The middle one? Okay. Looks good.

1458
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:33,489
SAM: For Bixby! Two.

1459
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:36,074
(laughter)

1460
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:39,161
LIAM: Would you like to use the rest of your
movement? You could back up a little bit,

1461
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:40,237
I guess.

1462
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:45,978
SAM: Yeah. Is there anything I can hide behind? Is
that a thing?

1463
01:15:45,978 --> 01:15:50,088
LIAM: No, the closest cover of any kind is 50 feet
away.

1464
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:53,433
SAM: And they're going to get me. I'll just go
huddle with Marisha and Matt.

1465
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:58,532
LIAM: Okay. Okay, there you are, a little chorus
line. Ashley, you're up.

1466
01:15:58,532 --> 01:16:11,409
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll walk up alongside the four of
them, just swinging the corpse. It's your call!

1467
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:19,296
You want to run, or you want to keep fighting?
Four of you down! Five, actually! Math wasn't my

1468
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,267
strong suit!

1469
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:25,597
LIAM: Laura, you're watching rebel teen Ashley
mouth off at some skinless cats. What would you

1470
01:16:25,597 --> 01:16:26,961
like to do?

1471
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:34,350
LAURA: I'm going to stand, walk around them--

1472
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,407
LIAM: To this side?

1473
01:16:36,407 --> 01:16:39,571
LAURA: Yeah, but back. Just stay behind them.

1474
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:40,828
LIAM: Here?

1475
01:16:40,828 --> 01:16:41,831
LAURA: Back further.

1476
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:42,804
LIAM: Here.

1477
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:43,632
LAURA: Further.

1478
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,496
LIAM: Okay.

1479
01:16:44,496 --> 01:16:50,264
LAURA: Yeah. Basically, I walk over so I can see.
And I ready my sticks, and I'm going to save my

1480
01:16:50,264 --> 01:16:51,318
action.

1481
01:16:51,318 --> 01:16:53,361
LIAM: Sure. You can do that.

1482
01:16:53,361 --> 01:16:55,520
SAM: Stick! Stick! Stick!

1483
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,762
LIAM: All right, Travis. What's up?

1484
01:16:57,762 --> 01:17:01,342
TRAVIS: I'll use my dash to try and join the other
crew.

1485
01:17:01,342 --> 01:17:03,707
LIAM: Aw, look at that.

1486
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:04,994
TRAVIS: Look at that.

1487
01:17:04,994 --> 01:17:08,000
LIAM: Awkward. Okay.

1488
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,055
MATT: Sweat just pouring down his face.

1489
01:17:10,055 --> 01:17:18,084
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing) My asthma is a problem
at this point. My Ventolin inhaler is broken.

1490
01:17:18,084 --> 01:17:23,175
MATT: We are straight-up the kids from It right
now, by the way.

1491
01:17:23,175 --> 01:17:33,008
LIAM: Oh yeah. (bell ding) The three cats continue
to-- well, they don't bristle, because they have

1492
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:41,149
no hair. They're still backing up. They move
backward into the tree cover, but you see them

1493
01:17:41,149 --> 01:17:47,500
stop. They don't flee. They get into the trees and
they sit and stare.

1494
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,903
LAURA: We should probably get out of here before
more cats come.

1495
01:17:51,903 --> 01:17:54,282
TRAVIS: I think they did that because something
bigger's coming.

1496
01:17:54,282 --> 01:17:57,549
LAURA: I think they did it because Ashley's
fucking scary as shit!

1497
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:59,708
TALIESIN: There was an old man when we got here
before.

1498
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,976
LAURA: You're really cool, Ashley.

1499
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,788
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1500
01:18:03,788 --> 01:18:07,426
MARISHA: Ashley and I just, football, huh! Huh!
And then we do the chest

1501
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,636
bump thing in the air. Huh!

1502
01:18:09,636 --> 01:18:11,585
LIAM: And whatever this stuff is goes (squishing)
between you.

1503
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:12,999
ALL: Ugh.

1504
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:19,429
MATT: Which me, being two feet away, (splashing
noise). That's still pretty cool.

1505
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:21,024
TRAVIS: We saw an old guy.

1506
01:18:21,024 --> 01:18:22,847
LAURA: Oh wait, what?

1507
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:25,849
TRAVIS: Yeah, we saw an old man, he was trying to
peel you out of the tomato plant you were in.

1508
01:18:25,849 --> 01:18:27,560
SAM: Which way did he go?

1509
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,866
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

1510
01:18:28,866 --> 01:18:31,844
TALIESIN: He went that way. That way, now.

1511
01:18:31,844 --> 01:18:33,312
ASHLEY: Can anybody track?

1512
01:18:33,312 --> 01:18:38,166
SAM: Let's go! I'm pretty good at that, at
tracking, I think.

1513
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,170
LIAM: Are you?

1514
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,883
SAM: I don't know, I'm a ranger. Isn't that what
rangers do?

1515
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:41,896
LIAM: Well, you're Sam.

1516
01:18:41,896 --> 01:18:42,924
SAM: Oh shit.

1517
01:18:42,924 --> 01:18:44,227
LIAM: Give it a shot.

1518
01:18:44,227 --> 01:18:47,209
SAM: I had a treehouse in the woods growing up.

1519
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:48,565
TRAVIS: Did you really?

1520
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:50,402
TALIESIN: That's come up so many times today!

1521
01:18:50,402 --> 01:18:52,014
LAURA: Okay, well, try to find the fucking old
guy!

1522
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:55,361
SAM: I mean, it was right behind my house.

1523
01:18:55,422 --> 01:18:59,160
MATT: He spent a long time trying to keep away
from old guys in the woods, so he knows how to

1524
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,626
track them well.

1525
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,081
LIAM: I'm going to give you, if you want to-- do
you want to track?

1526
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:04,042
SAM: Yeah!

1527
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,356
LIAM: All right, make a perception, right?

1528
01:19:06,356 --> 01:19:07,794
MATT: Tracking would be survival.

1529
01:19:07,794 --> 01:19:13,726
LIAM: Survival, that's what I was going to say.
But, for reasons, do it at advantage.

1530
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:14,723
SAM: Because--

1531
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:15,832
MATT: Because you're awesome!

1532
01:19:15,832 --> 01:19:17,093
TRAVIS: Because you love this.

1533
01:19:17,093 --> 01:19:19,453
SAM: Because I'm a ranger and rangers get
advantage in their favorite terrain.

1534
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:20,421
LIAM: Wrong.

1535
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:23,486
LAURA: Maybe because he knows you know the old
guy.

1536
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:24,611
SAM: Okay.

1537
01:19:24,611 --> 01:19:26,510
TALIESIN: Because Warner Bros is your favored
terrain?

1538
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,500
SAM: 13.

1539
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:35,405
LIAM: That's fine. You see where Verno booked it
before. You can see Verno went through the trees

1540
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:43,092
right here, but you see another break. You see a
vine split off right there, and you gather that he

1541
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:46,240
went in generally the same direction, not exactly,
where Travis went.

1542
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,455
SAM: I think he's that way.

1543
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:50,071
LAURA: Well, let's go find him.

1544
01:19:50,071 --> 01:19:51,663
SAM: Follow me, everyone.

1545
01:19:51,663 --> 01:19:56,290
LIAM: And this little seven-year-old boy with a
gigantic smile starts stalking his way through the

1546
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,192
bog and leading you.

1547
01:19:58,192 --> 01:20:02,601
(laughter)

1548
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,972
MARISHA: So cute!

1549
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:06,735
SAM: I didn't shower much.

1550
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:09,102
LAURA: So cute.

1551
01:20:09,102 --> 01:20:12,746
LIAM: Everybody's following Ranger Sam, right?

1552
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:13,562
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1553
01:20:13,562 --> 01:20:14,609
TALIESIN: Sure.

1554
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,775
LIAM: Okay. All right. So.

1555
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:18,694
MATT: Trying to clean my perpetually fogging
glasses because of the humid weather.

1556
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:25,693
LIAM: Yeah, it's like every 30 seconds here. So
you guys start walking, and after the first

1557
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:32,286
minute, you notice as you're going, Sam, in the
ground, something very different than anything

1558
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:38,722
else you've seen here. There's a long bar in the
ground, half sunken into the ground, and covered

1559
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:44,307
over. You only saw a glint of yellow, and it was
faded over and mucky, but you saw it. It looked

1560
01:20:44,307 --> 01:20:50,015
very different. Leaning down, you wipe away some
of the crap covering it, and you see sort of an

1561
01:20:50,015 --> 01:20:58,434
alternating yellow, black pattern. It's like a
long board. It's old, and it's wet and rotted

1562
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:05,687
through, but there's no mistaking one of those
things for gate entry.

1563
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:11,978
SAM: Oh, parking lot entry gate. Wait, does that
mean we're in an old overgrown parking lot? I'm

1564
01:21:11,978 --> 01:21:17,495
going to dig it out. Or I'll try.

1565
01:21:17,495 --> 01:21:21,633
LIAM: Okay. You don't even need to make any kind
of a check. Everything is so slick here, it just

1566
01:21:21,633 --> 01:21:28,298
slides out. You can't lift the whole thing or hold
the whole thing because it's eight feet long. As

1567
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:35,901
you pull it out, it's so soft, it breaks at one
spot, but there's no question what that is. This

1568
01:21:35,901 --> 01:21:40,309
is exactly a gate entry bar.

1569
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:46,333
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a wild guess. I'm
going to see if there's a little boxhouse nearby.

1570
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,221
MARISHA: Yeah, can I assist him on that?

1571
01:21:48,221 --> 01:21:49,221
LIAM: Sure.

1572
01:21:49,221 --> 01:21:50,976
TALIESIN: Where it would be, physically. I'm
getting a sneaky suspicion--

1573
01:21:50,976 --> 01:21:52,486
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

1574
01:21:52,486 --> 01:21:55,313
LAURA: Can you turn that stick into a weapon?

1575
01:21:55,313 --> 01:21:57,018
TALIESIN: Investigation?

1576
01:21:57,018 --> 01:21:57,999
LIAM: Yeah.

1577
01:21:57,999 --> 01:21:59,193
TALIESIN: Nine.

1578
01:21:59,193 --> 01:22:00,591
MARISHA: 13.

1579
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:07,696
LIAM: Nine? 13? Yeah, I mean, you've been to
Warner Bros.

1580
01:22:07,696 --> 01:22:11,153
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're still on the WB lot.

1581
01:22:11,153 --> 01:22:16,591
SAM: Those four posts were the tower! What was
left of it.

1582
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:21,228
LAURA: What does that even mean? How do we get
home?

1583
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,653
SAM: Well, we're in Burbank.

1584
01:22:23,653 --> 01:22:25,562
(laughter)

1585
01:22:25,562 --> 01:22:28,563
TALIESIN: Just several miles down the 405 ought to
do it.

1586
01:22:28,563 --> 01:22:30,234
TRAVIS: Should I say it?

1587
01:22:30,234 --> 01:22:31,765
TALIESIN: Do you want to say it?

1588
01:22:31,765 --> 01:22:32,897
SAM: Say what?

1589
01:22:32,897 --> 01:22:34,250
TALIESIN: You thought it, you might as well say
it.

1590
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,614
TRAVIS: I have a theory about where we are.

1591
01:22:35,614 --> 01:22:37,461
SAM: Well, we're at Warner Brothers.

1592
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:39,777
TRAVIS: I feel like we're in the Upside-Down.

1593
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:43,959
MARISHA: Of life, or WB?

1594
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:44,965
TRAVIS: Both.

1595
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:47,337
ASHLEY: What?

1596
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,551
TALIESIN: We're in the BW.

1597
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:54,418
(laughter)

1598
01:22:54,418 --> 01:22:56,745
LIAM: What do you guys want to do?

1599
01:22:56,745 --> 01:23:03,527
SAM: Well, wait, if these are security booths
here, maybe they have some handcuffs or something

1600
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,007
that we can get in there.

1601
01:23:05,007 --> 01:23:07,770
TRAVIS: Are there any working flashlights in the
security booth?

1602
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:10,590
LIAM: You can make an investigation check. You
didn't find anything.

1603
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,113
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you, just rummaging
through.

1604
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:17,269
LIAM: Go for it. You're digging through rot.

1605
01:23:17,269 --> 01:23:18,420
TRAVIS: 13.

1606
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,790
TALIESIN: 20.

1607
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,480
LIAM: Natural 20?

1608
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,026
TALIESIN: No, just 20.

1609
01:23:24,026 --> 01:23:31,665
LIAM: Okay. You dig, and you do find the
foundation of-- it's Hollywood Way. It's the exact

1610
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:37,937
setup for that little booth when you're going into
park, right under the tower. I mean, you haven't

1611
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:45,729
traveled that far, right? And there's nothing in
here. The bottom of the structure, the walls is

1612
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:52,821
there, you can tell where the bottom of the door,
the lintel? Is it the lintel? I don't know.

1613
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:54,592
SAM: Sure, why not.

1614
01:23:54,592 --> 01:23:57,509
LIAM: You found the gate post, and that's all you
found, there's no--

1615
01:23:57,509 --> 01:23:59,260
ASHLEY: There's no walls in the thing.

1616
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,965
LIAM: No, it's just the bottom of the structure.
You can just barely make out one corner.

1617
01:24:02,965 --> 01:24:08,378
TALIESIN: Does it feel like some of the buildings
might still be there, hidden in this forest

1618
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:10,811
structure, or is it just too dense?

1619
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,575
LIAM: You didn't see anything.

1620
01:24:12,575 --> 01:24:18,254
MARISHA: Can I backtrack, now that we're slowly
piecing this together, see if I can find the

1621
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:21,272
Hollywood Way sign? The street sign?

1622
01:24:21,272 --> 01:24:22,673
LIAM: Sure?

1623
01:24:22,673 --> 01:24:24,451
TALIESIN: Don't wander too far.

1624
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:27,551
MARISHA: No, I just want to turn around, if it's
right there.

1625
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:43,311
LIAM: You guys here, that way maybe was the tower,
about here's where you find the security gate, I

1626
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:46,713
guess, and old feller ran that way.

1627
01:24:46,713 --> 01:24:49,363
LAURA: (gasps) We should head towards Geek and
Sundry!

1628
01:24:49,363 --> 01:24:55,876
MARISHA: He went north? Is he going north on
Hollywood Way? I rolled a ten total.

1629
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:57,923
LIAM: To find a sign?

1630
01:24:57,923 --> 01:24:59,465
MARISHA: Hollywood Way.

1631
01:24:59,465 --> 01:25:00,983
LIAM: No, man.

1632
01:25:00,983 --> 01:25:04,297
SAM: Yeah, but we know the direction. We know
where the tower is. We know where the booth is. We

1633
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:05,556
just go that way.

1634
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:06,960
LAURA: Keep following the guy.

1635
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,436
MATT: The guy was pretty old?

1636
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,400
TRAVIS: He was super old. He was old and weak.

1637
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,480
LIAM: You saw a glint of glasses, too.

1638
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,286
TRAVIS: He had a glint of glasses.

1639
01:25:14,286 --> 01:25:18,437
MATT: If we keep going, we can probably catch up
to him because he's probably not very fast.

1640
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:20,787
SAM: You're a very smart young man.

1641
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:22,408
MATT: That's all I got.

1642
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:27,649
MARISHA: I didn't see anything! What if this is
just a Warner Bros specific thing? What if the

1643
01:25:27,649 --> 01:25:29,404
rest of LA is okay?

1644
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:32,757
SAM: I mean, we can see into LA and it's not,
right?

1645
01:25:32,757 --> 01:25:36,113
LAURA: Yeah, I climbed to the top of the tower.
It's jungle everywhere.

1646
01:25:36,113 --> 01:25:40,113
LIAM: If you can believe your eyes, San Fernando
Valley is this way.

1647
01:25:40,113 --> 01:25:42,566
MATT: Is this the future we're looking at?

1648
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:48,569
MARISHA: But, jungle versus Warner Bros sinking.
Is it everything?

1649
01:25:48,569 --> 01:25:50,879
SAM: We've got one option: we've got to follow
this old guy!

1650
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,375
LAURA: Let's follow the old guy!

1651
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:54,361
ASHLEY: When you climbed up to the top, you didn't
see any structures?

1652
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:55,925
LAURA: No, all I saw was jungle.

1653
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:57,348
ASHLEY: Shit!

1654
01:25:57,348 --> 01:26:01,506
MARISHA: Look, it's the Valley, there's not a lot
of skyscrapers.

1655
01:26:01,506 --> 01:26:04,164
LAURA: I mean it's a jungle here. It's a desert,
really.

1656
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:06,131
TRAVIS: Let's try to go after the old guy.

1657
01:26:06,131 --> 01:26:11,956
LAURA: They're not normal trees. They look like
engorged sausages.

1658
01:26:11,956 --> 01:26:16,991
ASHLEY: Wet Bulging Sausages. Warner Bros
Studios.

1659
01:26:16,991 --> 01:26:18,513
MARISHA: Turgid, engorged--

1660
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:20,459
ASHLEY: There's a lot that's going on right now.

1661
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:25,881
MATT: I start getting a nosebleed. Well, if
there's any building in this vicinity that lasts

1662
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:28,314
through time, it's the Bob's Big Boy.

1663
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:29,438
TRAVIS: It's true.

1664
01:26:29,438 --> 01:26:30,588
ASHLEY: That's true.

1665
01:26:30,588 --> 01:26:32,771
SAM: Why are we going to Bob's Big Boy?! Didn't he
go north on Hollywood Way?

1666
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:41,390
LIAM: He did. If you can believe your eyes, if
this nonsense is actually based on anything, then

1667
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,179
yes, he is heading along Hollywood Way.

1668
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:44,939
TALIESIN: We're going down Hollywood Way.

1669
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:53,094
LIAM: Okay. All right, so Ranger Sam leads the
way. You guys start traveling. It's slow-going

1670
01:26:53,094 --> 01:26:57,499
because it's wet and disgusting and there's trees
everywhere. You're going through fucking swamp.

1671
01:26:57,499 --> 01:27:01,369
LAURA: As we go, we should keep our eyes out for
anything that we can use as weapons.

1672
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:04,614
LIAM: There's lots of vines and rocks and sticks.

1673
01:27:04,614 --> 01:27:06,130
LAURA: There's nothing metal?

1674
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,761
SAM: Just Ashley.

1675
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:14,287
LIAM: The last metal you saw was Ashley Johnson
and what is presumably the base of the Warner Bros

1676
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:15,346
water tower.

1677
01:27:15,346 --> 01:27:21,394
ASHLEY: Can I, as we walk, with my handy-dandy
tools that are here that I see that you've added.

1678
01:27:21,394 --> 01:27:25,053
Can I start trying to fashion a slingshot?

1679
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,761
LIAM: Out of cat gut?

1680
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:28,573
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1681
01:27:28,573 --> 01:27:29,713
LIAM: Sure.

1682
01:27:29,713 --> 01:27:34,343
ASHLEY: Out of a nice little twig. Travis can
attest I'm pretty good with slingshots.

1683
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:36,739
LIAM: Make a survival check.

1684
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:43,363
ASHLEY: Okay.

1685
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:46,331
SAM: What are you, Ashley?

1686
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,422
ASHLEY: That's a seven, right?

1687
01:27:49,422 --> 01:27:51,064
MATT: Yeah.

1688
01:27:51,064 --> 01:27:52,602
MARISHA: She's Ashley.

1689
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:53,786
ASHLEY: 11.

1690
01:27:53,786 --> 01:27:59,591
LIAM: 11? Okay. So, what you're able to do as
you're walking is to pull and rip away some of the

1691
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:08,025
leg tendon from this thing's body. And now you've
got this stretchy piece of meat to work with.

1692
01:28:08,025 --> 01:28:09,453
MATT: (whispering) That's so cool!

1693
01:28:09,453 --> 01:28:13,313
LIAM: More on that later. You guys continue to
walk through the jungle and you're noticing that

1694
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:15,517
the ground is moving downward a bit now.

1695
01:28:15,517 --> 01:28:16,608
LAURA: Matt!

1696
01:28:16,608 --> 01:28:17,494
MATT: What?

1697
01:28:17,494 --> 01:28:19,304
LAURA: Can you heal me?

1698
01:28:19,304 --> 01:28:21,969
MATT: You look all right.

1699
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:23,748
LAURA: I saw you heal Marisha.

1700
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:25,675
MATT: I'm pretty spent right now.

1701
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,966
LIAM: Sam, do me a favor and make a perception
check.

1702
01:28:27,966 --> 01:28:31,317
SAM: Guys, I'm leading this party. Focus on me!

1703
01:28:31,317 --> 01:28:33,147
MATT: We're all going to die.

1704
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:36,503
LAURA: Can I try to close up my wounds that I
got?

1705
01:28:36,503 --> 01:28:37,754
SAM: 17.

1706
01:28:37,754 --> 01:28:38,934
LIAM: 17?

1707
01:28:38,934 --> 01:28:40,434
SAM: Yes.

1708
01:28:40,434 --> 01:28:50,904
LIAM: It's not a one or a two? Through a gap
between three trees, way in the distance, you see

1709
01:28:50,904 --> 01:28:59,006
a balding, white-haired little old man. And he
sees you seeing him, and he's gone again.

1710
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:06,488
SAM: Oh shit! I saw him! Guys, he's that way! We
should go that way, but maybe flank, right? I

1711
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:08,946
played paintball as a kid, so we can flank.

1712
01:29:08,946 --> 01:29:10,258
LIAM: You are a kid.

1713
01:29:10,258 --> 01:29:11,968
SAM: Come at him from two directions.

1714
01:29:11,968 --> 01:29:13,265
LIAM: You're running?

1715
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:14,316
TRAVIS: I'm booking ass.

1716
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:16,245
LIAM: Wow! Travis is just running today!

1717
01:29:16,245 --> 01:29:19,510
TRAVIS: I ran everywhere! I was fast as shit!

1718
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:21,098
LAURA: I'm running after Travis.

1719
01:29:21,098 --> 01:29:24,500
TRAVIS: My ADHD was in overdrive all the time.

1720
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,776
SAM: But you have the mind of a current-day
Travis.

1721
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:29,562
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm fast again, y'all!

1722
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:31,248
LIAM: Is everybody following suit?

1723
01:29:31,248 --> 01:29:32,399
LAURA: Yeah, I'm following Travis!

1724
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:34,307
SAM: No! I'm flanking! I'm flanking around.

1725
01:29:34,307 --> 01:29:35,441
LIAM: You're flanking?

1726
01:29:35,441 --> 01:29:37,831
MARISHA: I follow Riegel and I say, why are we
running?

1727
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,114
MATT: I follow Marisha because she's the biggest.

1728
01:29:40,114 --> 01:29:42,021
TALIESIN: I follow Travis.

1729
01:29:42,021 --> 01:29:43,652
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm running.

1730
01:29:43,652 --> 01:29:47,532
LIAM: Okay. Are you with this group? The flanking
or the straight-on?

1731
01:29:47,532 --> 01:29:48,848
ASHLEY: Straight-on.

1732
01:29:48,848 --> 01:29:53,381
LIAM: You guys start booking through and trying to
stay up. You're slipping as you go, but managing

1733
01:29:53,381 --> 01:29:59,107
to catch up. And he is old. You're getting closer
to the spot where you saw him, Sam. And you're

1734
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,887
looking over, you're playing the raptor; maybe you
can catch him from the side. You guys are still

1735
01:30:03,887 --> 01:30:11,005
going down. All of you are going down and then
ahead. You notice that you guys are in separate

1736
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:17,155
wedges of a hill that are both leading now to the
same place. And you see this guy again, and he

1737
01:30:17,155 --> 01:30:23,819
scuttles over a little ridge and down. He scuttles
up over a little bit of ridge of plant and mud,

1738
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:29,105
and then he disappears from view. And it's almost
like you're looking at-- it's so thick here, the

1739
01:30:29,105 --> 01:30:32,781
trees are so thick that you can probably get
through on the sides, but there's one big

1740
01:30:32,781 --> 01:30:38,444
main entrance here that is scooped up in like an
upside-down U of plant growth.

1741
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:39,970
SAM: One way in.

1742
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:42,954
LAURA: Let's start running.

1743
01:30:42,954 --> 01:30:44,220
MARISHA: Yeah, go.

1744
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,819
LAURA: Who's charging after him!

1745
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:47,382
SAM: We're all going in together, I guess.

1746
01:30:47,382 --> 01:30:48,571
LIAM: Okay.

1747
01:30:48,571 --> 01:30:50,441
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go run into the funnel.

1748
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:55,746
LIAM: Okay. all right. So you guys converge and
you're running after this old man, and you guys

1749
01:30:55,746 --> 01:31:01,507
climb up to the top of the ridge and you see-- oh
gosh, I think there's a scene in Jurassic Park

1750
01:31:01,507 --> 01:31:06,280
where it's a long sort of tunnel. Where that guy
gets eaten by the little critters? Anybody

1751
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:13,261
remember this? Yeah. And so it winds straight
ahead like that, and as you're running, Taliesin,

1752
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:20,319
you're the only one who sees it because you're the
shortest. You see a metal sign bent over, peeking

1753
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:26,823
out from behind two trees, red dripping down it.
And you see a one, you see a four. And then you're

1754
01:31:26,879 --> 01:31:36,497
past it, and everybody's running. And this old man
is maybe a hundred feet ahead of you.

1755
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:38,389
LAURA: Can we yell out to him?

1756
01:31:38,389 --> 01:31:39,514
LIAM: Sure.

1757
01:31:39,514 --> 01:31:44,050
LAURA: Hey! Stop running, what the fuck. We're
just trying to figure out what's happening!

1758
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,184
ASHLEY: We're just kids!

1759
01:31:46,184 --> 01:31:49,798
LIAM: He does stop, and spins around. He's still
pretty far away from you, and he looks

1760
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:52,770
(breathes heavily).

1761
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:53,739
LAURA: Hey!

1762
01:31:53,739 --> 01:32:01,040
LIAM: (breathes heavily) And he spins and he
continues to run.

1763
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,457
LAURA: Oh, come on!

1764
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:03,543
MARISHA: Oh, I keep going.

1765
01:32:03,543 --> 01:32:04,545
LAURA: We keep going.

1766
01:32:04,545 --> 01:32:12,123
LIAM: Everybody starts to run. I'm so sorry. You
feel the air around you start to vibrate around

1767
01:32:12,123 --> 01:32:21,669
you, and your head starts to rattle in your skull.
And you hear, at that moment, the sound of a war

1768
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:28,619
horn? Massive. It feels like the inside of your
head, your skull, is vibrating like a bell. Your

1769
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:35,094
teeth are shaking. Your eyes feel like they are
expanding in their sockets, and you feel

1770
01:32:35,094 --> 01:32:40,842
(explosion noise), and everything changes.

1771
01:32:40,842 --> 01:32:42,713
TRAVIS: It's Inception.

1772
01:32:42,713 --> 01:32:46,083
MARISHA: Oh god, are we going deeper? No.

1773
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:49,418
LIAM: Everything grows darker.

1774
01:32:49,418 --> 01:32:50,814
MARISHA: No.

1775
01:32:50,814 --> 01:33:02,381
LIAM: The gentler sounds of the jungle are
suddenly gone. You find yourselves, suddenly, as

1776
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:15,435
your sight stops blurring, looking at the ocean.
You're standing in miserably frigid cold water

1777
01:33:15,435 --> 01:33:22,135
swirling around your legs and your waist. And
you're staring out at the horizon, and the sky--

1778
01:33:22,135 --> 01:33:29,777
it's so jarring, it's so different than where you
were. You're staring out at dark clouds above you

1779
01:33:30,019 --> 01:33:38,267
and over the horizon. And that horn that is
blasting finally quits, and you just hear the

1780
01:33:38,267 --> 01:33:46,810
sound of the surf. Of waves crashing on a beach. A
beach behind you.

1781
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:52,164
ASHLEY: Are there any footprints on the beach
leading from the water?

1782
01:33:52,164 --> 01:33:58,610
LIAM: You turn away from the water, Ashley. And
from your place in the surf, you see the remnants

1783
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:09,833
and rubble of a freeway, stretching from the water
you're in back toward the land and away. But all

1784
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:16,258
of your minds, as you turn with her, have only a
second to process your whereabouts, because before

1785
01:34:16,258 --> 01:34:25,511
you stands a wall of horror. The living
manifestation of woe is gathered in front of you.

1786
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:37,195
A vast horde of writhing, malignant nightmares
stand watching you. All shapes and sizes.

1787
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,235
MARISHA: Casting directors.

1788
01:34:39,235 --> 01:34:48,252
LIAM: Black, oiled, insect-like flesh. White
chalky corpse-like figures. Literal devils.

1789
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:50,428
SAM: Commercial casting directors.

1790
01:34:50,428 --> 01:34:59,796
LIAM: Hundreds of eyes, seeming to hungrily covet
your flesh. And towering above them all, rising 40

1791
01:34:59,796 --> 01:35:07,995
to 50 feet in the air, stands an apocalyptic
monstrosity out of the Book of Revelations. A

1792
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:19,781
massive, two-headed titan standing on two scaled,
powerful legs, staring down at you all. The head

1793
01:35:19,781 --> 01:35:31,020
on this side, brow furrowed, face unmoving. The
eyes just judging you. The head on this side,

1794
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:40,306
craning forward, its terrible maw stretched wide.
A long tongue slathering back and forth across its

1795
01:35:40,306 --> 01:35:48,647
enormous teeth. Hungering. The horn of the
apocalypse tears the air again, rattling your

1796
01:35:48,647 --> 01:35:58,373
brains in your little skulls as the legion before
you begins to jibber and shriek. Everyone roll for

1797
01:35:58,373 --> 01:36:01,135
initiative.

1798
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:02,781
MARISHA: What's happening?

1799
01:36:02,781 --> 01:36:04,952
MATT: What?

1800
01:36:04,952 --> 01:36:07,699
SAM: It's everything we've ever faced.

1801
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:12,216
LAURA: Oh my god. We're going to die!

1802
01:36:12,216 --> 01:36:14,010
MARISHA: Brought to you by the producers of
Independence Day!

1803
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:15,213
LAURA: For real!

1804
01:36:15,213 --> 01:36:16,391
ASHLEY: What?

1805
01:36:16,391 --> 01:36:22,543
MATT: So, even-- (laughs) So. Do I know what this
is?

1806
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:24,392
MARISHA: From the producers of 2012!

1807
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:26,021
LIAM: You think so.

1808
01:36:26,021 --> 01:36:31,238
MATT: Okay. Me as Matt Mercer, even at 12, Matt
Mercer-- (laughs)

1809
01:36:31,238 --> 01:36:32,845
LAURA: Hey Matt!

1810
01:36:32,845 --> 01:36:34,714
LIAM: Can I get a little more juice on the audio,
please?

1811
01:36:34,714 --> 01:36:36,849
LAURA: Thanks for healing me!

1812
01:36:36,849 --> 01:36:39,086
MARISHA: Whoa!

1813
01:36:39,086 --> 01:36:40,960
LIAM: Let's roll for initiative, guys.

1814
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,082
TALIESIN: Oh god.

1815
01:36:42,082 --> 01:36:44,067
MATT: Oh, great. That's great.

1816
01:36:44,067 --> 01:36:48,413
SAM: As, as we roll, I look down to see if-- Are
we any older, or are we the same age?

1817
01:36:48,413 --> 01:36:49,481
LIAM: Same age.

1818
01:36:49,481 --> 01:36:50,618
MARISHA: Same age?

1819
01:36:50,618 --> 01:36:54,567
SAM: I check if I've got pubes. Do I have pubes?

1820
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:56,124
LIAM: 25 to 20?

1821
01:36:56,124 --> 01:36:58,591
TRAVIS: Nope. Nair.

1822
01:36:58,591 --> 01:37:01,865
LIAM: Nobody there? 15 to 20?

1823
01:37:01,865 --> 01:37:02,941
LAURA: 17.

1824
01:37:02,941 --> 01:37:04,183
MARISHA: 15.

1825
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:08,835
LIAM: 17, 15? Laura, Marisha. Okay, ten to 15?

1826
01:37:08,835 --> 01:37:10,018
TALIESIN: 13.

1827
01:37:10,018 --> 01:37:11,064
LIAM: 13.

1828
01:37:11,064 --> 01:37:12,499
SAM: Ten!

1829
01:37:12,499 --> 01:37:17,798
LIAM: Ten. Okay. I got Travis, Ashley, and Matt
left. What have you guys got?

1830
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:18,869
ASHLEY: Seven.

1831
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:19,898
TRAVIS: Nine.

1832
01:37:19,898 --> 01:37:21,286
MATT: Four.

1833
01:37:21,286 --> 01:37:22,293
LIAM: Okay.

1834
01:37:22,293 --> 01:37:25,447
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

1835
01:37:25,447 --> 01:37:26,954
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1836
01:37:26,954 --> 01:37:30,512
ASHLEY: What?

1837
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:32,463
MARISHA: What are these things?

1838
01:37:32,463 --> 01:37:34,198
LAURA: What is that big thing?

1839
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:35,751
SAM: You know, I think we can take them, guys.

1840
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:37,185
ASHLEY: Can anybody make a boat?

1841
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:38,579
MARISHA: It's a really big thing.

1842
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:40,509
LIAM: Laura Bailey.

1843
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:41,647
LAURA: What?

1844
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,622
LIAM: What would you like to do?

1845
01:37:43,622 --> 01:37:45,113
LAURA: Where are we?

1846
01:37:45,113 --> 01:37:49,390
LIAM: Oh. That's important, isn't it? You're in
the water.

1847
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:53,221
MATT: So, you guys know in Stranger Things, that
the big monster they keep talking about?

1848
01:37:53,221 --> 01:37:54,379
ASHLEY: The demogorgon?

1849
01:37:54,379 --> 01:37:55,605
LAURA: The demogorgon?

1850
01:37:55,605 --> 01:37:57,813
MARISHA: Is that what that is?

1851
01:37:57,813 --> 01:37:59,506
SAM: I think we can take it.

1852
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:01,425
LAURA: I think--

1853
01:38:01,425 --> 01:38:07,007
SAM: Wait. They won't come into the water. Maybe
we just stay here.

1854
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:09,479
TALIESIN: That's gremlins. Gremlins won't come
into the water.

1855
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:12,231
(laughter)

1856
01:38:12,231 --> 01:38:13,757
MATT: Gremlins can go in the water.

1857
01:38:13,757 --> 01:38:14,964
TALIESIN: That just makes more of them.

1858
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:16,723
MATT: Yeah. There's no good answer here.

1859
01:38:16,723 --> 01:38:18,517
LAURA: Matt, how do you kill these things?

1860
01:38:18,517 --> 01:38:26,240
MATT: I can't tell you. My initiative's four. Go!
I'm too scared. In fact, if we weren't halfway in

1861
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,872
the ocean, you would see the soak marks on the
front of my jeans.

1862
01:38:29,872 --> 01:38:32,210
TRAVIS: And in fact, around Matt, the water is
quite warm.

1863
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:33,342
MATT: Yeah.

1864
01:38:33,342 --> 01:38:35,759
TALIESIN: Better than a chlorinated pool, man

1865
01:38:35,759 --> 01:38:38,078
MARISHA: (laughs) A chlorinated pool?

1866
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,200
TALIESIN: It'd be a little green.

1867
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,144
LAURA: I have nothing. I'm just going to back up
further into the water.

1868
01:38:43,144 --> 01:38:49,206
LIAM: Okay. It is rough going. You can go about 15
feet as you push your way back. Now you're moving

1869
01:38:49,206 --> 01:38:54,059
backward in the water, and the water's now up to
your childlike collarbone.

1870
01:38:54,059 --> 01:39:03,270
LAURA: Can I hold my breath and put it under the
water and see what I can see under the water?

1871
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,836
LIAM: That's what you want to do?

1872
01:39:04,836 --> 01:39:05,814
LAURA: Yeah!

1873
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:10,003
LIAM: Okay, you do. You splash under
the water, and it is jarring. It is so ice-cold.

1874
01:39:10,054 --> 01:39:16,243
And as you do, you see a very thick serpent swim
past your face.

1875
01:39:16,243 --> 01:39:25,736
LAURA: What?! Bubbles! (laughs) I come back up out
of the water. We're surrounded! There's something

1876
01:39:25,736 --> 01:39:27,210
in the water!

1877
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,143
MATT: (screams)

1878
01:39:29,143 --> 01:39:32,084
LIAM: Marisha, what would you like to do?

1879
01:39:32,084 --> 01:39:34,851
MARISHA and LAURA: (scream)

1880
01:39:34,851 --> 01:39:36,666
TRAVIS: Go. Have no fear!

1881
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:45,351
MARISHA: Okay. Well, I fucking hate the cold above
all things! Which is a hundred percent true, so

1882
01:39:45,351 --> 01:39:51,291
I'm going to fuck this ice-water shit, and start
heading out towards the beach, just because that

1883
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:53,145
would be my first concern.

1884
01:39:53,145 --> 01:39:58,117
LIAM: Okay. You are now standing on the beach,
looking at a legion from hell.

1885
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:15,008
MARISHA: I say, Yeah! What's up?! This is the
party at the end of the world, right? And I just

1886
01:40:15,008 --> 01:40:24,139
start dancing. Hey! And I cry a little. Oh! Hey!
Oh!

1887
01:40:24,139 --> 01:40:29,231
LIAM: The giant continues to judge you. On your
sides, there are two very large-- not as big as

1888
01:40:29,231 --> 01:40:36,062
the big guy, obviously, but two winged, twice the
size of you guys, bent over muscular ropey winged

1889
01:40:36,062 --> 01:40:43,434
creatures, and they just stand there going (raspy
breaths) here and here. Taliesin, what would you

1890
01:40:43,434 --> 01:40:44,436
like to do?

1891
01:40:44,436 --> 01:40:48,737
TALIESIN: I'm going to join Marisha on the beach
because I hate the water.

1892
01:40:48,737 --> 01:40:50,057
LIAM: Yes, I remembered.

1893
01:40:50,057 --> 01:40:52,930
TALIESIN: And it's cold. And this has kind of
happened to me before.

1894
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:54,462
SAM: The whole monster thing?

1895
01:40:54,462 --> 01:40:57,923
TALIESIN: This whole thing has kind of happened.
And, this is true, I'm going to say what I said

1896
01:40:57,923 --> 01:40:58,968
last time.

1897
01:40:58,968 --> 01:41:00,161
MARISHA: Do it.

1898
01:41:00,161 --> 01:41:05,081
TALIESIN: This is true, and you might know this.
Mister Satan dude, we are totally

1899
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:07,377
ready to serve you!

1900
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:10,342
(laughter)

1901
01:41:10,342 --> 01:41:12,746
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

1902
01:41:12,746 --> 01:41:20,252
TALIESIN: This is literally what I said last time
this happened. Oh boy, that's not great.

1903
01:41:20,252 --> 01:41:22,029
TRAVIS: But there are fish in the ocean,
Taliesin!

1904
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:23,705
TALIESIN: That's why I got out. Eight.

1905
01:41:23,705 --> 01:41:25,865
LIAM: Eight? Noted. Okay.

1906
01:41:25,865 --> 01:41:29,620
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my full action until
something happens.

1907
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:34,176
LIAM: Okay, until what happens?

1908
01:41:34,176 --> 01:41:38,677
TALIESIN: Until they start moving within ten feet
of me.

1909
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:40,803
LIAM: Okay, got it. Sam, what would you like to
do?

1910
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:42,662
SAM: I'm going to also join them on the beach.

1911
01:41:42,662 --> 01:41:43,815
LIAM: Okay.

1912
01:41:43,815 --> 01:41:55,604
SAM: And similarly, I'm going to hold up the skull
of Bixby and say: We serve the darkness as you do!

1913
01:41:55,604 --> 01:42:03,370
We will do your bidding if you will let us! Please
spare our lives so that we may serve yours!

1914
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:06,192
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

1915
01:42:06,192 --> 01:42:10,654
SAM: 14.

1916
01:42:10,654 --> 01:42:16,512
LIAM: Okay, noted. Ashley, what would you like to
do?

1917
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:29,445
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to go up on the beach, and
I'm going to join them in their persuasion, and

1918
01:42:29,445 --> 01:42:36,296
I'm going to use the dead cat again. And I'm just
going to take a bite of it.

1919
01:42:36,296 --> 01:42:38,883
(laughter)

1920
01:42:38,883 --> 01:42:40,191
MARISHA: You're Ozzy Osbourne and shit?

1921
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:41,808
TALIESIN: We could have so hung out.

1922
01:42:41,808 --> 01:42:45,102
LIAM: Make a persuasion check.

1923
01:42:45,102 --> 01:42:51,218
ASHLEY: Does that count?

1924
01:42:51,218 --> 01:42:52,579
MATT: It's what you rolled.

1925
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:57,686
ASHLEY: 19.

1926
01:42:57,686 --> 01:42:59,682
LIAM: Okay, noted.

1927
01:42:59,682 --> 01:43:01,393
SAM: That's good.

1928
01:43:01,393 --> 01:43:15,617
LIAM: Yes, it is. Gigantic feet crunch down in the
sand as he slowly walks forward, or they do, and

1929
01:43:15,617 --> 01:43:19,307
one head stares at you, little man.

1930
01:43:19,307 --> 01:43:20,684
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1931
01:43:20,684 --> 01:43:24,022
LIAM: Make a strength check.

1932
01:43:24,022 --> 01:43:29,424
TRAVIS: A strength check. That's a nine.

1933
01:43:29,424 --> 01:43:40,440
LIAM: Okay. Travis, you feel your whole body lock
up as you are lifted out of the water, straight up

1934
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:49,686
into the air, and a little bit forward. And your
little duder body is just floated forward and you

1935
01:43:49,686 --> 01:43:56,790
are frozen in terror. You can't move a muscle, and
the head on this side is just staring at you.

1936
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:58,177
TRAVIS: Oh god.

1937
01:43:58,177 --> 01:44:01,317
LAURA: Just a little poo falls into the water.

1938
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:07,162
TRAVIS: A little rabbit pellet makes it through
the shorts. Straight through.

1939
01:44:07,162 --> 01:44:09,965
MATT: You've been hoarding Cocoa Puffs.

1940
01:44:09,965 --> 01:44:11,930
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

1941
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:24,270
MATT: Okay. So, being both a bard and being a kid
that both as an adult and in that age spent a lot

1942
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:32,150
of free time alone reading monster manuals and
cryptozoology books, can I possibly see if I

1943
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:39,468
recognize any sort of nature to this creature? Any
sort of religious context to it, or any idea where

1944
01:44:39,468 --> 01:44:41,707
it may have come from?

1945
01:44:41,707 --> 01:44:46,915
LIAM: It looks like the shit you saw in your DND
books, man.

1946
01:44:46,915 --> 01:45:00,890
MATT: Okay! Seeing as how Ashley already seems to
be the one that's on the right track, I'm going to

1947
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:04,057
begin to step towards the water. Using a bonus
action, I'm going to go ahead and give her bardic

1948
01:45:04,057 --> 01:45:08,516
inspiration and be like, Ashley, continue to prove
your savagery!

1949
01:45:08,516 --> 01:45:12,532
(laughter)

1950
01:45:12,532 --> 01:45:17,935
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

1951
01:45:18,092 --> 01:45:26,129
MATT: Chew deep and revel in the insanity, as this
day, we prove our mettle against the force of

1952
01:45:26,309 --> 01:45:27,684
darkness!

1953
01:45:27,684 --> 01:45:29,654
ASHLEY: Chew deep?

1954
01:45:29,654 --> 01:45:31,000
MATT: Yes!

1955
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,345
MARISHA: What does that even mean, chew deep?

1956
01:45:33,345 --> 01:45:36,824
TRAVIS: With fogged-up glasses.

1957
01:45:36,824 --> 01:45:42,369
MATT: Yeah, my glasses right are now are like
every classic anime teacher, it's just too fogged

1958
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:47,980
where you can't see the eyes. It's just a straight
white glare. I step out of the water towards this

1959
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:55,230
entity and say: Oh great demogorgon, deity from
upon the Abyss who brings its hordes to the

1960
01:45:55,230 --> 01:46:01,029
shoreline, we are but humble servants, prostrate
before you, granting you the power we have to

1961
01:46:01,098 --> 01:46:06,409
offer as we ourselves traverse across many worlds.
We have much gifts to grant you, and follow you to

1962
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:08,502
the ends of this plane.

1963
01:46:08,502 --> 01:46:12,421
LIAM: Make a religion check.

1964
01:46:12,421 --> 01:46:17,194
MATT: Not so great. Seven.

1965
01:46:17,194 --> 01:46:22,951
LIAM: One last little squirt comes out of your
ding dong.

1966
01:46:22,951 --> 01:46:26,653
MATT: You got this, Ashley!

1967
01:46:26,653 --> 01:46:36,523
LIAM: He would like to use one of his legendary
actions now. And you see his long, nightmarish

1968
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:46,602
tail swing, coil, and then whip out, and strikes
down and lands on Marisha and crushes her into the

1969
01:46:46,602 --> 01:47:01,853
beach and rips away. And you see a smear on the
sand. You see a clump of red hair. And some

1970
01:47:01,853 --> 01:47:03,176
innards.

1971
01:47:03,176 --> 01:47:10,752
TRAVIS: You're a track mark!

1972
01:47:10,752 --> 01:47:15,237
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

1973
01:47:15,237 --> 01:47:17,237
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

1974
01:47:17,237 --> 01:47:21,316
LAURA: I think I'm going to just stand back in the
water and continue to scream.

1975
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:23,577
LIAM: Okay. Noted.

1976
01:47:23,577 --> 01:47:29,503
LAURA: (screams) Get back in the water! Get back!
It just killed Marisha! Get back in the water! And

1977
01:47:29,503 --> 01:47:32,420
then I'm going to try and jump up and see if I can
reach Travis's leg.

1978
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,610
LIAM: His leg? He's 30 feet in the air.

1979
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:35,847
LAURA: I can't reach you!

1980
01:47:35,847 --> 01:47:38,512
TRAVIS: Watch out, there's poop down there!

1981
01:47:38,512 --> 01:47:41,298
LAURA: I see it!

1982
01:47:41,298 --> 01:47:44,801
LIAM: Is that the end?

1983
01:47:44,801 --> 01:47:48,398
LAURA: I'm just staying. I'm going to stay and
just hold my sticks.

1984
01:47:48,398 --> 01:47:59,886
LIAM: Off on your left, you see. (splashing
noises) It doesn't come all the way. It just

1985
01:47:59,886 --> 01:48:01,911
watches you.

1986
01:48:01,911 --> 01:48:08,814
MARISHA: Guys, they hate people who are
marketable! That's the key! Be marketable!

1987
01:48:08,814 --> 01:48:13,136
MATT: Which is the echo we hear in our minds. We
don't hear out loud, as she's nothing

1988
01:48:13,136 --> 01:48:14,549
but a hairy smear.

1989
01:48:14,549 --> 01:48:16,763
LIAM: Mr. Mom, what would you like to do?

1990
01:48:16,763 --> 01:48:18,714
SAM: Woobie, woobie, woobie!

1991
01:48:18,714 --> 01:48:42,717
TALIESIN: I am not pleased. I am going to start
wishing that we had some help with this somehow,

1992
01:48:42,717 --> 01:48:48,505
and I'm going to start, I suppose, casting Unseen
Servant?

1993
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,023
LIAM: Okay.

1994
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:55,746
TALIESIN: And I'm going to attempt to create
something to catch Travis when he lands.

1995
01:48:55,746 --> 01:48:56,825
LIAM: Okay.

1996
01:48:56,825 --> 01:49:02,947
TALIESIN: And otherwise, I think I'm just staring
at the ground for the moment, because that was a

1997
01:49:02,947 --> 01:49:04,806
lot that just happened.

1998
01:49:04,806 --> 01:49:11,225
LIAM: Yeah. Guys, everybody sees a spectral form
of a grown Taliesin Jaffe appear next to child

1999
01:49:11,225 --> 01:49:18,536
Taliesin Jaffe, and floats over floating Verno,
and spectral Taliesin just starts

2000
01:49:18,536 --> 01:49:21,315
going like this.

2001
01:49:21,315 --> 01:49:25,015
TALIESIN: Thank you for making that as awkward as
humanly possible.

2002
01:49:25,015 --> 01:49:28,499
LIAM: Yes, you're welcome. All done?

2003
01:49:28,499 --> 01:49:29,653
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2004
01:49:29,653 --> 01:49:31,553
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

2005
01:49:31,553 --> 01:49:41,018
SAM: I mean, those are tendrils? What are those
things, those are just arms?

2006
01:49:41,018 --> 01:49:42,131
LIAM: Tendrils.

2007
01:49:42,131 --> 01:49:43,788
MATT: Giant arm. Tentacle arm.

2008
01:49:43,788 --> 01:49:46,793
TRAVIS: Kill me. Kill me!

2009
01:49:46,793 --> 01:49:48,826
SAM: With what, a rock?

2010
01:49:48,826 --> 01:49:50,579
TRAVIS: I'm fucking dying up here, man!

2011
01:49:50,579 --> 01:49:53,685
TALIESIN: If you try and kill him with a rock,
you'll kill him, so just go for it.

2012
01:49:53,685 --> 01:50:00,147
SAM: I'm going to use my movement and my action to
dash--

2013
01:50:00,147 --> 01:50:01,347
LIAM: Which way?

2014
01:50:01,347 --> 01:50:02,872
SAM: At the demogorgon?

2015
01:50:02,872 --> 01:50:03,706
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2016
01:50:03,706 --> 01:50:10,858
SAM: And I'm going to try to kill it with love and
give it a big hug around its leg and say, I

2017
01:50:10,858 --> 01:50:12,106
forgive you!

2018
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:13,299
LIAM: You grab it by the leg?

2019
01:50:13,299 --> 01:50:14,212
SAM: Yeah.

2020
01:50:14,212 --> 01:50:18,178
LIAM: Okay, noted. Ashley, what would you like to
do?

2021
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:33,068
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to continue with what I'm
doing. I'm going to walk to Marisha's smear.

2022
01:50:33,068 --> 01:50:35,150
Schmear?

2023
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:37,208
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, half her body's gone.

2024
01:50:37,208 --> 01:50:46,449
ASHLEY: That's fine. Don't know what I'm doing, I
was weird as a 15-year-old, so I'm going to walk

2025
01:50:46,449 --> 01:50:59,055
over to her body, what's left, and get my hands in
it. And I'm going to stare him in the eye, and I'm

2026
01:50:59,055 --> 01:51:01,503
going to smear it.

2027
01:51:01,503 --> 01:51:05,940
LIAM: You guys watch in horror as your friend
Ashley, pushed to the brink, crouches down and

2028
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:13,413
shoves her hands up into the hollowed-out ribcage
of Marisha Ray, pulls her hands down, and slathers

2029
01:51:13,413 --> 01:51:16,957
it down her face, and suddenly we're in the Lord
of the Flies.

2030
01:51:16,957 --> 01:51:22,783
ASHLEY: Is her ribcage free and loose?

2031
01:51:22,783 --> 01:51:26,064
LIAM: Loose? I mean, yeah, she's a third of her
former weight.

2032
01:51:26,064 --> 01:51:28,659
ASHLEY: I'm going to put it over my head.

2033
01:51:28,659 --> 01:51:31,056
LIAM: That's your whole action. Okay.

2034
01:51:31,056 --> 01:51:32,072
ASHLEY: That's fine.

2035
01:51:32,072 --> 01:51:33,215
MARISHA: Wait, you're holding me?

2036
01:51:33,215 --> 01:51:34,854
MATT: You're wearing her like a scarecrow?

2037
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:41,851
LIAM: Ashley picks up Marisha's broken open chest
cavity and head and matches the form of demogorgon

2038
01:51:41,851 --> 01:51:44,749
somewhat and puts a second head on herself.

2039
01:51:44,749 --> 01:51:45,788
MARISHA: What?

2040
01:51:45,788 --> 01:51:46,931
TRAVIS: Yep.

2041
01:51:46,931 --> 01:51:50,389
MARISHA: This is like what I want to have happen
when I die.

2042
01:51:50,389 --> 01:51:52,498
LIAM: You're out of juice.

2043
01:51:52,498 --> 01:51:54,001
TALIESIN: Died like she lived.

2044
01:51:54,106 --> 01:51:55,080
ASHLEY: I don't know what to do.

2045
01:51:55,163 --> 01:51:57,364
MARISHA: Wear like me a spirit hood! Do it,
Ashley, do it!

2046
01:51:57,364 --> 01:52:01,324
MATT: She's puppeteering you like a Skeksis!
You're a Henson puppet!

2047
01:52:01,324 --> 01:52:10,351
LIAM: Demogorgon's turn. Do you want to do
anything, Travis?

2048
01:52:10,351 --> 01:52:13,610
TRAVIS: Oh sure, I just want to fucking run like a
rabbit, man.

2049
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:16,724
LIAM: Well, you're floating in the air. You want
to try to break free of his grip?

2050
01:52:16,724 --> 01:52:19,146
TRAVIS: I'm going to go with it.

2051
01:52:19,146 --> 01:52:20,817
LIAM: All right. You're going to go with it?

2052
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:21,915
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2053
01:52:21,915 --> 01:52:29,795
LIAM: He takes one step forward with Sam on the
leg, going for the ride, and Travis floats

2054
01:52:29,795 --> 01:52:37,444
forward, right up between the two thing's heads
and the angry one on this side goes (growling) and

2055
01:52:37,444 --> 01:52:43,539
takes the upper half of your body into its mouth
and the other one more daintily goes (chomping)

2056
01:52:43,539 --> 01:52:51,411
and pulls a leg free, and child Travis is ripped
in half in front of you, blood raining down on Sam

2057
01:52:51,411 --> 01:52:53,748
down below.

2058
01:52:53,748 --> 01:52:59,608
TRAVIS: You hear a really girly scream from inside
the one mouth.

2059
01:52:59,608 --> 01:53:04,783
SAM: But love conquers all!

2060
01:53:04,783 --> 01:53:06,222
LAURA: Oh my god!

2061
01:53:06,222 --> 01:53:08,403
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

2062
01:53:08,403 --> 01:53:10,823
MATT: Well, I've spent the entirety of the last
six seconds just staring at the place on the

2063
01:53:10,823 --> 01:53:15,315
ground where Marisha was crushed. So I haven't
really been paying attention. Loosely paying

2064
01:53:15,486 --> 01:53:20,808
attention to Ashley rummaging through her remains
and then wearing them like a wintertime jacket.

2065
01:53:20,808 --> 01:53:22,139
ASHLEY: Sorry!

2066
01:53:22,139 --> 01:53:27,707
MATT: But my fists are clenched, they're shaking,
the tears are streaming down my face, and whatever

2067
01:53:27,766 --> 01:53:33,631
plan we had is out the window, and I just rush
towards the demogorgon, screaming. (screams) And

2068
01:53:33,631 --> 01:53:35,184
I'm going to Thunderwave him.

2069
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:37,201
LIAM: Yes! Do it!

2070
01:53:37,201 --> 01:53:40,578
MATT: So he needs to make a constitution saving
throw.

2071
01:53:40,578 --> 01:53:42,975
LIAM: Are we doing anything about Sam?

2072
01:53:42,975 --> 01:53:46,464
MATT: I don't fucking care about Sam right now, I
just want to hurt this thing.

2073
01:53:46,464 --> 01:53:47,469
LIAM: Got it.

2074
01:53:47,469 --> 01:53:48,830
SAM: I'm a child, Matt!

2075
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:52,636
LIAM: Got it. And it's, what is it, it's
constitution? Help me.

2076
01:53:52,636 --> 01:53:56,712
MATT: Constitution. I'm just like, tears down my
face, just (screaming).

2077
01:53:56,712 --> 01:53:59,226
LIAM: Okay. Sam, make a constitution save.

2078
01:53:59,226 --> 01:54:04,944
SAM: 16 plus-- there's no number written there.

2079
01:54:04,944 --> 01:54:06,707
MATT: You made it, he succeeds.

2080
01:54:06,707 --> 01:54:08,654
LIAM: Yeah. Okay, so roll for damage.

2081
01:54:08,654 --> 01:54:16,644
MATT: That is 13.

2082
01:54:16,644 --> 01:54:18,226
LIAM: 13? Okay.

2083
01:54:18,226 --> 01:54:19,433
MATT: 13 thunder damage.

2084
01:54:19,433 --> 01:54:31,421
LIAM: You take six points of damage. Matt runs up
in anguish and just rage-terror screams and for no

2085
01:54:31,421 --> 01:54:37,629
reason at all, a blast of energy just goes
(explosion noise) right out of him, rips the

2086
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:43,949
clothes off of Sam Riegel's child back, leaving
scars all over him. And the demogorgon just shifts

2087
01:54:43,949 --> 01:54:55,667
his foot a little bit. And he'd like to use a
legendary action to stare at Crazy Pants Johnson.

2088
01:54:55,667 --> 01:55:03,032
And you look at these two heads, now looking at
you, and their eyes seem to swirl in a miasma of

2089
01:55:03,032 --> 01:55:08,663
hatred, and you feel your mind just go. Roll a
d10, please.

2090
01:55:08,663 --> 01:55:11,489
ASHLEY: Okay.

2091
01:55:11,489 --> 01:55:16,684
MATT: As my bonus action on my turn?

2092
01:55:16,684 --> 01:55:17,709
LIAM: Yes.

2093
01:55:17,709 --> 01:55:24,364
MATT: I now realise that I accidentally hit Sam,
and I'm like, Sam. We have to end this now. Let's

2094
01:55:24,364 --> 01:55:27,425
do this. And you get an inspiration die, d6.

2095
01:55:27,425 --> 01:55:30,010
LIAM: Okay. What did you roll on the d10?

2096
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:31,896
ASHLEY: I rolled a nine.

2097
01:55:31,896 --> 01:55:40,889
LIAM: A nine? Oh. You felt your gorge rise up.
You're covered in the guts of your friend,

2098
01:55:40,889 --> 01:55:48,230
Marisha. This is really weird, that thing is a
giant! But you've got to fight it, right? Yeah,

2099
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:51,513
I'm okay! I'm okay! And you steel yourself.

2100
01:55:51,513 --> 01:55:54,568
SAM: Nice. She's hardcore.

2101
01:55:54,568 --> 01:55:56,800
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

2102
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,403
LAURA: As soon as I see it tear apart Travis?

2103
01:55:59,403 --> 01:56:00,498
LIAM: Yeah.

2104
01:56:00,498 --> 01:56:02,833
LAURA: I'm going to just turn the other way and
just start swimming out.

2105
01:56:02,833 --> 01:56:03,742
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2106
01:56:03,742 --> 01:56:05,406
(laughter)

2107
01:56:05,406 --> 01:56:06,832
LIAM: Okay, I'll just put you there on the map.

2108
01:56:06,832 --> 01:56:09,525
LAURA: Nope! Nope, nope, nope!

2109
01:56:09,525 --> 01:56:12,649
MATT: She takes the nope action.

2110
01:56:12,649 --> 01:56:14,504
(laughter)

2111
01:56:14,504 --> 01:56:16,294
TRAVIS: Triple dash!

2112
01:56:16,294 --> 01:56:21,780
LIAM: You start to swim. You feel a serpent slide
past your rib cage as you go, and you freak out as

2113
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:22,903
you swim--

2114
01:56:22,903 --> 01:56:24,269
LAURA: I'm going to take my stick and hit it!

2115
01:56:24,269 --> 01:56:29,439
LIAM: You can't do that, because two clawed feet
latch into your back and lift you up, out of the

2116
01:56:29,439 --> 01:56:40,082
water. You are now dangling about 20 feet-- yeah,
20 feet above the water. Here. Just dog paddling

2117
01:56:40,082 --> 01:56:46,017
to nothing. And that's its turn. And Taliesin,
what would you like to do?

2118
01:56:46,017 --> 01:56:49,863
TALIESIN: I get the sneaking suspicion that we're
screwed.

2119
01:56:49,863 --> 01:56:51,606
TRAVIS: No, we're doing good.

2120
01:56:51,606 --> 01:56:53,925
MATT: Yeah, on the ropes, man. On the ropes.

2121
01:56:53,925 --> 01:56:55,389
SAM: He's looking pretty rough.

2122
01:56:55,389 --> 01:56:56,802
TRAVIS: This is where we turn the tide.

2123
01:56:56,802 --> 01:56:58,739
LAURA: He's definitely bloodied.

2124
01:56:58,739 --> 01:57:02,212
TALIESIN: I'm feeling a little like this might be
the end. I'm not feeling pretty

2125
01:57:02,212 --> 01:57:04,139
good about this, so--

2126
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:06,812
MARISHA: Walk into the ocean.

2127
01:57:06,812 --> 01:57:12,513
TALIESIN: I'm just going to flick it off, and the
one, the little creature on the right--

2128
01:57:12,513 --> 01:57:14,429
LIAM: This guy?

2129
01:57:14,429 --> 01:57:17,208
TALIESIN: Yeah. Chill Touch. Just going to crush
that fucker as just a fuck-you.

2130
01:57:17,373 --> 01:57:20,653
LIAM: Okay. Make a ranged attack.

2131
01:57:20,653 --> 01:57:25,122
TALIESIN: Yeah. 15.

2132
01:57:25,122 --> 01:57:26,425
LIAM: Sure.

2133
01:57:26,425 --> 01:57:32,095
TALIESIN: I probably have to roll for damage on
that one because he's not tiny. Where's my d8s?

2134
01:57:32,095 --> 01:57:39,870
Two. That's two points of necrotic damage.

2135
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:41,559
LIAM: Two points? Okay.

2136
01:57:41,559 --> 01:57:43,200
TALIESIN: It's just a 1d8, right?

2137
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,449
LIAM: Yes, that's correct. It's 1d8.

2138
01:57:45,449 --> 01:57:46,475
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2139
01:57:46,475 --> 01:57:50,182
LIAM: All right. So you plant your hand down into
the sand, and you feel that same energy surge out

2140
01:57:50,182 --> 01:57:55,257
of your palm, and it bursts up under this
corpulent little pasty-faced dude, and it reaches

2141
01:57:55,257 --> 01:58:01,199
up and grabs him by the gut, and pulls away a love
handle in tentacle form, down into the ground. And

2142
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:07,647
everybody around him just starts going (snarling),
and he's just got innards spilling out, going

2143
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:09,816
(gravelly dying sounds).

2144
01:58:09,816 --> 01:58:11,845
LAURA: Gross.

2145
01:58:11,845 --> 01:58:18,593
TALIESIN: I'm going to move my Unseen Servant
underneath Laura, just in case, to try and pull

2146
01:58:18,593 --> 01:58:20,544
her to shore if she goes back down.

2147
01:58:20,544 --> 01:58:25,460
LIAM: All right, so your Unseen Servant moves just
below Laura, and he uses his legendary action, and

2148
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:30,975
the tail whips out and goes (whipping sound), and
you watch as two-thirds of Taliesin's child guts are

2149
01:58:30,975 --> 01:58:37,054
ripped out and he just falls, face forward, down
into the sand, and he is dead, and the Unseen

2150
01:58:37,242 --> 01:58:38,800
Servant vanishes.

2151
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,159
LAURA: Oh no!

2152
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:44,018
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

2153
01:58:44,018 --> 01:58:45,094
SAM: Me?

2154
01:58:45,094 --> 01:58:46,189
LIAM: Yeah.

2155
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:47,457
SAM: I'm partially naked.

2156
01:58:47,457 --> 01:58:48,623
LIAM: Yeah.

2157
01:58:48,623 --> 01:58:54,704
SAM: I'm hugging a demogorgon. I would like to
climb up a little up his leg.

2158
01:58:54,704 --> 01:58:55,881
LIAM: Okay.

2159
01:58:55,881 --> 01:59:10,191
SAM: And just say: Kill them, but save me. I will
fan you and get you food, and whatever. Just kill

2160
01:59:10,191 --> 01:59:13,152
them all. They're nothing, just save me. Just save
me.

2161
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,670
LIAM: Okay.

2162
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:15,671
SAM: That's it.

2163
01:59:15,671 --> 01:59:17,014
LIAM: Okay. Ashley.

2164
01:59:17,014 --> 01:59:18,414
SAM: Do I have to roll on anything?

2165
01:59:18,414 --> 01:59:19,343
LIAM: Huh?

2166
01:59:19,343 --> 01:59:20,485
SAM: Do I need to roll?

2167
01:59:20,485 --> 01:59:22,280
LIAM: I mean, you already tried to persuade this
dude.

2168
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,315
SAM: All right. Then I got nothing.

2169
01:59:25,315 --> 01:59:27,644
LIAM: Sure. Make a persuasion, at disadvantage.

2170
01:59:27,644 --> 01:59:29,015
SAM: At disadvantage?

2171
01:59:29,015 --> 01:59:29,917
LIAM: Yes.

2172
01:59:29,917 --> 01:59:31,537
MATT: You can add your inspiration dice, if you
want.

2173
01:59:31,537 --> 01:59:32,891
SAM: Well, it's a natural one.

2174
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:37,775
MATT: Oh. You probably shouldn't. You should hold
off on that. Save it for the next-- oh wait.

2175
01:59:37,775 --> 01:59:41,849
LIAM: Ashley, what would you like to do?

2176
01:59:41,849 --> 01:59:47,753
ASHLEY: Okay.

2177
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:52,830
(laughter)

2178
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:55,733
ASHLEY: Your head up here. Listen.

2179
01:59:55,733 --> 01:59:57,994
TRAVIS: She starts with "listen." (laughs)

2180
01:59:57,994 --> 02:00:06,320
ASHLEY: We already know what's going to happen
here. We know we're going to die. But, guess what?

2181
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:14,662
After this, we go to another world, so you know
what? I don't like leading, and I don't like

2182
02:00:14,662 --> 02:00:20,385
following, you motherfucker! Is my slingshot
ready?

2183
02:00:20,439 --> 02:00:23,433
LIAM: No, you didn't have a chance to get to
that.

2184
02:00:23,433 --> 02:00:29,684
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out a rock out of my
pocket, and I'm going to throw it at him.

2185
02:00:29,684 --> 02:00:31,487
LIAM: Go for it. Make a ranged attack.

2186
02:00:31,487 --> 02:00:33,913
ASHLEY: Okay. What am I doing?

2187
02:00:33,913 --> 02:00:35,432
LIAM: Roll a d20.

2188
02:00:35,432 --> 02:00:41,516
ASHLEY: I don't add anything, do I?

2189
02:00:41,516 --> 02:00:51,878
LIAM: You might! It would be, for a ranged attack,
if it's not a weapon. It's an improvised weapon.

2190
02:00:51,878 --> 02:00:53,477
Nothing.

2191
02:00:53,477 --> 02:00:56,504
MATT: Well, dex or strength would be plus two.
You're not proficient with it

2192
02:00:56,504 --> 02:00:58,441
LIAM: Let's do the dex.

2193
02:00:58,441 --> 02:01:00,010
MATT: So, plus two to whatever you rolled.

2194
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:01,408
ASHLEY: (laughs) A six.

2195
02:01:01,408 --> 02:01:05,262
LIAM: The rock bounces off of his belly
button-type area.

2196
02:01:05,262 --> 02:01:08,520
ASHLEY: I don't care. I did it. I didn't mean for
it to actually hurt you.

2197
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:09,278
LIAM: Right.

2198
02:01:09,278 --> 02:01:12,198
MATT: She has that much control!

2199
02:01:12,198 --> 02:01:17,862
LIAM: Okay, well, the next thing that happens is
the double-armed tentacle comes down and wraps

2200
02:01:17,862 --> 02:01:27,163
around your neck. And you watch as (splitting
noise) and you see two heads spin out to the

2201
02:01:27,163 --> 02:01:28,080
ocean.

2202
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,184
TALIESIN: You killed it!

2203
02:01:29,184 --> 02:01:30,393
LIAM: 40 feet.

2204
02:01:30,393 --> 02:01:33,499
LAURA: Oh no!

2205
02:01:33,499 --> 02:01:34,952
SAM: Who's left?

2206
02:01:34,952 --> 02:01:36,554
LAURA: Me and Matt and Sam.

2207
02:01:36,554 --> 02:01:38,421
SAM: My plan is working; I'm still alive!

2208
02:01:38,421 --> 02:01:42,175
LAURA: I think he doesn't realize you're there.

2209
02:01:42,175 --> 02:01:43,737
LIAM: What would you like to do, Matt?

2210
02:01:43,737 --> 02:01:54,704
MATT: All right, staring this thing down, my
eyes-- I can't see anything because the water, so

2211
02:01:54,704 --> 02:01:59,317
I rip the glasses off the front of my face and
throw them behind me on the beach and staring up

2212
02:01:59,317 --> 02:02:05,206
at it I say: I know everything about you. I've
seen your pictures, I've read every single aspect

2213
02:02:05,278 --> 02:02:10,467
of your existence. And here's the fun part: when
it all comes down to it, you're just a figment of

2214
02:02:10,467 --> 02:02:15,052
some fat guy's imagination! Vicious Mockery.

2215
02:02:15,052 --> 02:02:16,284
LIAM: Yeah!

2216
02:02:16,284 --> 02:02:17,408
ASHLEY: Yes!

2217
02:02:17,408 --> 02:02:18,693
LIAM: Legit!

2218
02:02:18,693 --> 02:02:24,290
MATT: Nice, that's-- well, it makes a wisdom
saving throw.

2219
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:26,990
SAM: How do you want to do this?

2220
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:29,549
LIAM: What did you roll?

2221
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:31,927
MATT: Well, my DC is 13.

2222
02:02:31,927 --> 02:02:41,534
LIAM: 13, okay. You see the angrier one on this
side going (growls, huffs, growls louder)

2223
02:02:41,714 --> 02:02:44,042
MATT: Yeah!

2224
02:02:44,042 --> 02:02:52,709
LIAM: And the other head swivels around so
they're both looking at you, and they stare into

2225
02:02:52,709 --> 02:03:01,392
your insecure little 12-year-old soul. Roll a d10,
Matthew.

2226
02:03:01,392 --> 02:03:05,372
MATT: Yeah. That's a sensitive place. Ten?

2227
02:03:05,372 --> 02:03:13,925
LIAM: Ten? You have played too much fucking DND.
Nothing happens! You hold your own against the

2228
02:03:13,925 --> 02:03:15,418
demogorgon.

2229
02:03:15,418 --> 02:03:17,714
TRAVIS: (laughs) You've played too much DND.

2230
02:03:17,714 --> 02:03:20,053
LIAM: Laura, what would you like to do?

2231
02:03:20,053 --> 02:03:24,918
LAURA: I'm going to take my sticks out and I'm
going to try to stab the tentacle that's holding

2232
02:03:24,918 --> 02:03:26,517
me up in the air.

2233
02:03:26,517 --> 02:03:28,054
LIAM: Roll to make an attack.

2234
02:03:28,054 --> 02:03:31,094
LAURA: Do I add anything? My dex?

2235
02:03:31,094 --> 02:03:32,080
LIAM: Yes, your dex.

2236
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,328
LAURA: 11.

2237
02:03:33,328 --> 02:03:35,765
LIAM: Okay.

2238
02:03:35,765 --> 02:03:38,002
LAURA: I'm trying to break out my grapple.

2239
02:03:38,002 --> 02:03:41,478
LIAM: Right. Well, that would be a strength check.
Do you want to break out of the grapple?

2240
02:03:41,478 --> 02:03:48,780
LAURA: Oh. Well, I'm just going to try to-- no,
I'm going to attack the tentacle.

2241
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:53,629
LIAM: Okay. Well, that doesn't do shit because
he's got you so firmly grasping in his taloned

2242
02:03:53,629 --> 02:03:56,062
feet that you can't turn around and get at him.

2243
02:03:56,062 --> 02:03:57,875
LAURA: Oh, then I try to break out of the
grapple!

2244
02:03:57,875 --> 02:04:04,240
LIAM: No, what happened was you tried to get him
with a stick and you couldn't turn around. You got

2245
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,775
a bonus action?

2246
02:04:05,775 --> 02:04:08,975
LAURA: I don't know what I can do as a bonus
action.

2247
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:11,193
SAM: She's a rogue.

2248
02:04:11,193 --> 02:04:13,831
LIAM: Rogue.

2249
02:04:13,831 --> 02:04:20,079
LAURA: I can't disengage; I'm not a high enough
level. I'm just a me.

2250
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:21,433
LIAM: Level of Laura?

2251
02:04:21,433 --> 02:04:24,104
LAURA: Yeah, level of Laura at 13, 12, or
whatever.

2252
02:04:24,104 --> 02:04:32,330
LIAM: Okay. You hear a little sizzling sound and
you feel the thing's body flex against you, and

2253
02:04:32,387 --> 02:04:38,592
then you don't even know what happened; there is a
noxious fume all around you going into your eyes

2254
02:04:38,592 --> 02:04:45,270
and your nose. Everything burns; your throat and
your nose burn, the insides of your ears burn. I

2255
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:48,662
would like you to make a con save.

2256
02:04:48,662 --> 02:04:54,707
LAURA: Okay. 11!

2257
02:04:54,707 --> 02:05:01,858
LIAM: Okay. Your body locks up. You can't move and
he lets go. You fall into the water, frozen.

2258
02:05:01,858 --> 02:05:03,769
SAM: That's nice!

2259
02:05:03,769 --> 02:05:05,862
TALIESIN: In theory, you'd be caught by my Unseen
Servant.

2260
02:05:05,862 --> 02:05:07,480
LIAM: No, that vanished when you died.

2261
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,846
TALIESIN: Oh, that vanished when I died!

2262
02:05:08,846 --> 02:05:10,366
LAURA: Oh no!

2263
02:05:10,366 --> 02:05:14,865
MATT: You fall just in time to see this floating
Taliesin go (wind whooshing).

2264
02:05:15,052 --> 02:05:16,425
That would suck so bad.

2265
02:05:16,425 --> 02:05:18,374
LIAM: Sam, what would you like to do?

2266
02:05:18,374 --> 02:05:20,389
MARISHA: I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm not okay!

2267
02:05:20,389 --> 02:05:23,913
SAM: I climb up higher.

2268
02:05:23,913 --> 02:05:25,799
LIAM: Now make an athletics check.

2269
02:05:25,799 --> 02:05:29,474
SAM: Sure. Natural 20!

2270
02:05:29,474 --> 02:05:31,448
LIAM: Oh my god, how high do you want to go?

2271
02:05:31,448 --> 02:05:33,248
SAM: All the way up to its ear.

2272
02:05:33,248 --> 02:05:41,239
LIAM: Done. You scrabble up like a little spider
monkey all the way up, panicked, climbing up on

2273
02:05:41,239 --> 02:05:44,035
top. "Hi!" And you're there.

2274
02:05:44,035 --> 02:05:53,985
SAM: I can sing you show tunes! I know doo-wop
songs! I will do your bidding forever if you just

2275
02:05:53,985 --> 02:05:56,110
let me live!

2276
02:05:56,110 --> 02:06:00,410
LIAM: And your voices stops as the sharp end of
his tail splits through the back of your skull and

2277
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:02,909
breaks your face open entirely.

2278
02:06:02,909 --> 02:06:04,422
SAM: I can work with this!

2279
02:06:04,422 --> 02:06:08,959
LIAM: Beautiful, beautiful smile. That beautiful
smile gone.

2280
02:06:08,959 --> 02:06:12,663
TRAVIS: And then there was two.

2281
02:06:12,663 --> 02:06:16,406
MARISHA: Rodgers and Hammerstein.

2282
02:06:16,406 --> 02:06:17,546
SAM: True.

2283
02:06:17,546 --> 02:06:18,674
MATT: That'll kill you.

2284
02:06:18,674 --> 02:06:27,357
LIAM: The demogorgon bends over and looks down at
you, Matthew, and somehow, you knew this was the

2285
02:06:27,357 --> 02:06:41,585
way it would always be. And a giant, ropey foot
rises up and you don't see shit. Laura, what would

2286
02:06:41,585 --> 02:06:43,753
you like to do? Oh, she's not here.

2287
02:06:43,753 --> 02:06:45,299
SAM: Oh my god, she disappeared.

2288
02:06:45,299 --> 02:07:01,317
LIAM: She's also drowning. We don't need her,
then. Okay. Hey, I want that, yeah. So, her body

2289
02:07:01,317 --> 02:07:12,349
frozen in the ocean, water seeping in. She feels
her throat constrict and choke, and everything

2290
02:07:12,349 --> 02:07:32,206
goes quiet. Not that quiet. There we go. The
vision blurs and turns a pure, merciful white.

2291
02:07:32,262 --> 02:07:33,901
And that's where we'll take our break.

2292
02:07:34,095 --> 02:07:35,044
MARISHA: Oh, what?

2293
02:07:35,044 --> 02:07:36,196
MATT: All righty!

2294
02:07:36,196 --> 02:07:37,732
SAM: We're dead! End of session.

2295
02:07:37,732 --> 02:07:39,650
LIAM: We'll just talk about it for an hour after
we come back.

2296
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:40,749
MATT: Probably.

2297
02:07:40,749 --> 02:07:42,237
MARISHA: I've had this dream.

2298
02:07:42,237 --> 02:07:45,590
LIAM: I did have this dream. This is based on a
nightmare I had.

2299
02:07:45,590 --> 02:07:47,145
MATT: Oh, what?

2300
02:07:47,145 --> 02:07:48,784
ASHLEY: That's a terrible one.

2301
02:07:48,784 --> 02:07:50,329
LIAM: It was real bad.

2302
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:55,736
TRAVIS: Did Ashley wear the upper torso of
Marisha in your dream?

2303
02:07:55,736 --> 02:08:02,640
LIAM: No, none of you were there. It was just me
on a godforsaken beach. In my dream, these things,

2304
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:10,106
it wasn't demogorgon, it was Revelations, and they
were all on shitty wooden scaffolding, stretching

2305
02:08:10,106 --> 02:08:17,451
in every direction for miles. And I just felt that
big and I was like, "Well, this is it." And that

2306
02:08:17,451 --> 02:08:19,599
was the nightmare.

2307
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:22,279
SAM: I dreamt that I was late to a plane.

2308
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:24,876
(laughter)

2309
02:08:24,876 --> 02:08:31,515
LIAM: That your eyesight was one tick off of
20/20. Dreadful. Well, guys that was a lot of fun.

2310
02:08:31,515 --> 02:08:36,588
We laughed. We cried. We died. We'll see you in a
few.

2311
02:08:36,588 --> 02:08:41,035
MARISHA: Oh, watch the Tabletop promo, it's real
good. We're real proud of it.

2312
02:08:41,035 --> 02:08:51,959
LIAM: Is this mid-break, this guy? Yeah, sorry,
before I forget! Giveaway! I have got a Wyrmwood

2313
02:08:51,959 --> 02:08:54,967
dice vault made of pink ivory wood.

2314
02:08:54,967 --> 02:08:56,343
MARISHA: Yeah, you do!

2315
02:08:56,343 --> 02:08:59,626
LIAM: You wanna get that code word: demogorgon!

2316
02:08:59,626 --> 02:09:01,087
MARISHA and LIAM: Demogorgon!

2317
02:09:01,087 --> 02:09:06,093
MARISHA: Spell it correctly if you want to win!
Demi-gorgon.

2318
02:09:06,093 --> 02:09:07,740
LIAM: Demo.

2319
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,746
MARISHA: Demo-gorgon.

2320
02:09:09,746 --> 02:09:11,710
LIAM: This could be yours in hell.

2321
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:13,386
MARISHA: Chat will get it.

2322
02:09:13,386 --> 02:09:14,537
MATT: Chat will get it.

2323
02:09:14,537 --> 02:29:08,358
[break]

2324
02:29:08,599 --> 02:29:14,652
LIAM: It won't work this time. Hey guys! Welcome
back. So, right off the top, we have been doing

2325
02:29:14,652 --> 02:29:18,532
this show for hundreds and hundreds of hours, and
for the first time ever we have a player going

2326
02:29:18,532 --> 02:29:25,278
home sick. Laura is tapping out. She probably has
got the same thing Brian Foster had. We'll all be

2327
02:29:25,278 --> 02:29:26,750
next, yay.

2328
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,291
TRAVIS: Especially because we French kiss all the
time.

2329
02:29:29,291 --> 02:29:36,061
LIAM: So, I'll miss twinnie, but I want twinnie to
be a part of the story, so I will include her.

2330
02:29:36,061 --> 02:29:44,301
She'll be there, but not physically on set. What
else? So our winner for the dice vault over the

2331
02:29:44,301 --> 02:29:49,601
break was YassieXD. YassieXD, you now have a
lovely box for your dice to put it in!

2332
02:29:49,601 --> 02:29:51,025
MATT: Congrats.

2333
02:29:51,025 --> 02:29:52,517
(cheering)

2334
02:29:52,517 --> 02:29:57,151
LIAM: Man, I'm thrown. I'm thrown, my friend went
home. Oh, well. What else do we do now, do I just

2335
02:29:57,151 --> 02:29:58,434
start? Is that what I do?

2336
02:29:58,434 --> 02:29:59,531
MATT: Jump right in, motherfucker.

2337
02:29:59,531 --> 02:30:00,690
LIAM: All right.

2338
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:04,067
TRAVIS: Everybody's dead, so...

2339
02:30:04,067 --> 02:30:06,572
MARISHA: So we're all dead?

2340
02:30:06,572 --> 02:30:08,060
SAM: Good game, good game.

2341
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:09,524
LIAM: This is the post-mortem.

2342
02:30:09,524 --> 02:30:12,942
MARISHA: We built Dis post-mortem?

2343
02:30:12,942 --> 02:30:15,732
SAM: Nope.

2344
02:30:15,732 --> 02:30:18,309
LIAM: Darkness.

2345
02:30:18,309 --> 02:30:20,143
SAM: Darkness.

2346
02:30:20,143 --> 02:30:42,529
LIAM: Quiet. You have no sense of time. Minutes,
days, you don't know. A voice barks out, "Okay,

2347
02:30:42,599 --> 02:30:51,243
"that was really good, let's go right back into
another one." Ashley, your eyes flutter open and

2348
02:30:51,295 --> 02:31:01,866
squint in the glare of bright white light from all
sides. They adjust. "Guys, we good? I wanna go

2349
02:31:01,866 --> 02:31:10,383
"right into another." You look around. You're lying
in a large white room. The walls are padded with

2350
02:31:10,383 --> 02:31:12,394
soft cloth material.

2351
02:31:12,394 --> 02:31:14,243
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2352
02:31:14,243 --> 02:31:15,348
LIAM: Ashley, you sit up--

2353
02:31:15,348 --> 02:31:16,615
ASHLEY: This is my nightmare!

2354
02:31:16,615 --> 02:31:26,804
LIAM: -- and see Neil? Naughty Dog creative
director Neil Druckmann?

2355
02:31:26,804 --> 02:31:29,408
(laughter)

2356
02:31:29,408 --> 02:31:36,466
LIAM: Walking over towards you. You realize there
are cameras everywhere, lining the walls, there's

2357
02:31:36,466 --> 02:31:43,822
monitors nearby, cables. You see a very familiar
crew at their stations. You look down. Oh, shit.

2358
02:31:43,822 --> 02:31:52,253
P-cap suit. You are in a full performance-capture
suit. You are all lying on your backs in full

2359
02:31:52,253 --> 02:32:00,060
performance-capture suits, and you're still
fucking kids?

2360
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:04,484
(laughter)

2361
02:32:04,484 --> 02:32:09,404
LIAM: Neil, with his glorious beard, walks up, but
calls out over his shoulder, says, "Liam, I'm

2362
02:32:09,404 --> 02:32:13,822
"sorry, don't get too comfortable, we're going to
move on to your scene pretty soon. Don't pass out

2363
02:32:13,822 --> 02:32:21,373
"on me." And you see over on the lounge-y area, a
pair of shoes lying off the side of a couch, and

2364
02:32:21,373 --> 02:32:28,870
you hear a dorky voice say, "Got it. Okay."
"Ashley, Ashley, can I grab a word over here?"

2365
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:31,021
ASHLEY: Yes. Yes, please.

2366
02:32:31,021 --> 02:32:32,762
LIAM: He's ahead of you, though, by like 20 feet.

2367
02:32:32,762 --> 02:32:33,992
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2368
02:32:33,992 --> 02:32:38,673
LIAM: You walk over and you see he's doing that
thing where he's standing on the outside of his

2369
02:32:38,673 --> 02:32:48,852
feet, looking down. When he senses that you've
walked up, he says, "Question. For the first line

2370
02:32:48,873 --> 02:32:52,795
"of this scene, what are you feeling right now?"

2371
02:32:52,795 --> 02:33:02,529
ASHLEY: I'm feeling... confused.

2372
02:33:02,529 --> 02:33:04,380
LIAM: "Okay."

2373
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:13,807
ASHLEY: A little... I think I just need... How are
you feeling about it? Like, what are you feeling--

2374
02:33:13,807 --> 02:33:18,805
what is missing? What's going on?

2375
02:33:18,805 --> 02:33:22,828
LIAM: Let me just interject as the Dungeon Master
and let you know that he is not showing any

2376
02:33:22,828 --> 02:33:25,775
recognition that you are 14 at all.

2377
02:33:25,775 --> 02:33:27,126
ASHLEY: Okay.

2378
02:33:27,126 --> 02:33:33,737
LIAM: At all. "I don't know, I mean, I think that
was just the first take, I shouldn't second-guess

2379
02:33:33,737 --> 02:33:39,135
"myself, but do you think that that line is
something that you would say?"

2380
02:33:39,135 --> 02:33:47,716
ASHLEY: Is that line something I would say? Is
there-- maybe if it just sounded weird-- maybe

2381
02:33:47,716 --> 02:33:51,655
there's another way to say it? If you had to just
spitball, what would be another way that I could

2382
02:33:51,655 --> 02:33:53,381
say it?

2383
02:33:53,453 --> 02:34:05,428
LIAM: "Okay. This time, I want you to..." Strokes
his beard. "Doubt."

2384
02:34:05,428 --> 02:34:07,971
ASHLEY: Doubt.

2385
02:34:07,971 --> 02:34:10,812
LIAM: "I mean, I don't want to give you--"

2386
02:34:10,812 --> 02:34:13,809
ASHLEY: Do you have the sides on you, actually? Do
you have the script on you?

2387
02:34:13,809 --> 02:34:21,809
LIAM: "Colla, could we get the sides in for
everybody?" Colla comes running in. You guys are

2388
02:34:21,809 --> 02:34:26,226
all getting up to your feet, also kids in full
performance-capture suits.

2389
02:34:26,226 --> 02:34:28,362
MATT: I just...

2390
02:34:28,362 --> 02:34:30,279
SAM and LIAM: Aww.

2391
02:34:30,279 --> 02:34:37,842
LIAM: Everyone's taller than you. Bill Beemer
comes running over, and he starts going, "Gah,

2392
02:34:37,842 --> 02:34:42,672
"this is weird," but he hands out sides to you all.
You can open your envelopes now,

2393
02:34:42,672 --> 02:34:44,124
looking at sides.

2394
02:34:44,124 --> 02:34:48,412
MARISHA: Are these sides? Yeah!

2395
02:34:48,412 --> 02:34:50,922
MATT: Inspire Bill Beemer?

2396
02:34:50,922 --> 02:34:58,991
LIAM: And you start reminding yourselves of the
scene that you've never seen before. Yeah, yeah,

2397
02:34:58,991 --> 02:35:03,331
absorb that. Ashley, while you're reading, out of
the corner of your eye you see Neil off on the

2398
02:35:03,331 --> 02:35:09,971
side just sorta like flipping a prop knife over
and over again absent-mindedly while he thinks.

2399
02:35:09,971 --> 02:35:11,741
Drops it.

2400
02:35:11,741 --> 02:35:14,427
ASHLEY: Can I-- Neil.

2401
02:35:14,427 --> 02:35:15,983
LIAM: "Yeah."

2402
02:35:15,983 --> 02:35:19,394
ASHLEY: Can I have that prop knife?

2403
02:35:19,394 --> 02:35:21,004
LIAM: "Sure."

2404
02:35:21,004 --> 02:35:26,093
ASHLEY: I just wanna see if it'll make the scene
any different.

2405
02:35:26,093 --> 02:35:28,809
(laughter)

2406
02:35:28,809 --> 02:35:30,666
SAM: Such a good actor.

2407
02:35:30,666 --> 02:35:39,685
LIAM: "Are you guys good? Laura, your accent kind
of wandered just a little bit,

2408
02:35:39,685 --> 02:35:41,575
"you want me to get J.B.?"

2409
02:35:41,575 --> 02:35:44,585
(laughter)

2410
02:35:44,585 --> 02:35:47,447
MATT: Now this has become her nightmare.

2411
02:35:47,447 --> 02:35:56,089
LIAM: Laura makes the most stinkface you've ever
seen. She says, "No, I'm good." From her very

2412
02:35:56,089 --> 02:36:02,199
short stature. "I was just a little off that
time."

2413
02:36:02,199 --> 02:36:07,078
"Okay, do we wanna go for another one? Is
everyone feeling--"

2414
02:36:07,078 --> 02:36:09,457
ASHLEY: Can I-- hey, Liam?

2415
02:36:09,457 --> 02:36:11,338
LIAM: "Yeah?"

2416
02:36:11,338 --> 02:36:14,727
ASHLEY: Can you come here for just like two
seconds?

2417
02:36:14,727 --> 02:36:16,820
LIAM: "Okay."

2418
02:36:16,820 --> 02:36:19,732
MATT: As this is happening, I walk up to Neil, I'm
like, by the way, I know we've met a number of

2419
02:36:19,732 --> 02:36:22,207
times, but I just wanna tell you, it's a great
pleasure to finally have an opportunity to work

2420
02:36:22,207 --> 02:36:23,170
with you.

2421
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:25,824
(laughter)

2422
02:36:25,824 --> 02:36:33,430
MARISHA: And I walk up behind and I go, hi. I'm
his girlfriend. (nervous laugh)

2423
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:41,344
LIAM: (whispers) You know you're already on the
job, right? That was me. Neil says, "Oh, of

2424
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:46,167
"course, of course, I mean yeah, yeah. I'm sorry,
what were you saying?"

2425
02:36:46,167 --> 02:36:49,102
ASHLEY: I just wanted to talk to Liam for just
like two seconds.

2426
02:36:49,102 --> 02:36:52,676
LIAM: Yeah, Liam's already wandered up. He's in
full performance-capture suit. He's an adult.

2427
02:36:52,676 --> 02:36:56,338
Yeah. And he's looking down, but whatever.

2428
02:36:56,338 --> 02:37:09,267
ASHLEY: (laughs) I just-- I forgot what I was
gonna ask. It's fine. I just wanted to-- I was

2429
02:37:09,267 --> 02:37:15,210
gonna ask you something, but I forgot. It's good
to see you. Good to see you. Go back to bed.

2430
02:37:15,210 --> 02:37:18,032
LIAM: "We're all glad to have you back in town.
I'm gonna go back to the couch."

2431
02:37:18,032 --> 02:37:23,717
TRAVIS: Hey, wait, wait, before you go, Liam. What
do we look like to you?

2432
02:37:23,717 --> 02:37:26,391
LIAM: "Assholes." Walks back to the couch.

2433
02:37:26,391 --> 02:37:27,610
TALIESIN: Fuck.

2434
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:28,581
ASHLEY: Wait.

2435
02:37:28,581 --> 02:37:30,028
LIAM: "Yeah?"

2436
02:37:30,028 --> 02:37:35,395
ASHLEY: If you had to guess how old I was, what
would you guess?

2437
02:37:35,395 --> 02:37:37,969
LIAM: "This seems like a dangerous question to
me."

2438
02:37:37,969 --> 02:37:40,449
ASHLEY: Don't let it be dangerous. I can take it.

2439
02:37:40,449 --> 02:37:41,315
LIAM: "Really?"

2440
02:37:41,315 --> 02:37:44,359
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Straight-up, how old do you
think I look?

2441
02:37:44,359 --> 02:37:47,071
LIAM: "I feel like there's no right answer to give
to this question?"

2442
02:37:47,071 --> 02:37:48,556
ASHLEY: There's no right answer.

2443
02:37:48,556 --> 02:37:56,218
LIAM: "You're-- I mean, I know it's early 30s.
33?"

2444
02:37:56,218 --> 02:37:58,420
ASHLEY: Bingo.

2445
02:37:58,420 --> 02:38:02,601
LIAM: "Hey!" And he does a little dance and just
dances his way back up to the couch area,

2446
02:38:02,601 --> 02:38:04,526
lands down.

2447
02:38:04,526 --> 02:38:06,105
ASHLEY: Guys.

2448
02:38:06,105 --> 02:38:10,969
SAM: I guess people see us as super-old.

2449
02:38:10,969 --> 02:38:15,401
MARISHA: Or super-professional! Look at this
velcro suit!

2450
02:38:15,401 --> 02:38:17,662
SAM: Oh, you don't wear these?

2451
02:38:17,662 --> 02:38:21,354
MARISHA: Like once. And then the game got
canceled, so what's it matter?

2452
02:38:21,354 --> 02:38:27,697
LIAM: "Guys. Guys. I mean, do we need to talk this
scene out, or do you want to do another one, or?"

2453
02:38:27,697 --> 02:38:31,011
ASHLEY: We're...

2454
02:38:31,011 --> 02:38:34,741
SAM: We're professionals, we're gonna do this.

2455
02:38:34,741 --> 02:38:37,913
TRAVIS: I don't wanna speak for Laura, but she
doesn't really like to rehearse beforehand,

2456
02:38:37,913 --> 02:38:38,797
she just--

2457
02:38:38,797 --> 02:38:40,067
ASHLEY: Let's just jump right in.

2458
02:38:40,067 --> 02:38:41,030
LIAM: "Jump right in?"

2459
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:42,526
ASHLEY: I'm sure we're gonna have notes again.

2460
02:38:42,526 --> 02:38:47,544
LIAM: "Okay, we're gonna take another one, uno
mas." Bill Beemer--

2461
02:38:47,544 --> 02:38:54,857
MATT: Is it general T-pose, or A-T-pose? Okay.
T-pose.

2462
02:38:54,857 --> 02:38:57,962
LIAM: "You're good." Bill Beemer comes out and
says,

2463
02:38:57,962 --> 02:39:03,868
"All right, Savage Starlight, scene 23B,
take two. Audio rolling."

2464
02:39:03,868 --> 02:39:05,676
MATT: Guys, wait!

2465
02:39:05,676 --> 02:39:12,422
LIAM: "Camera rolling. Okay, Neil, the floor is
yours." He wanders off, Neil backs off at the

2466
02:39:12,422 --> 02:39:16,918
volume, off to the edge on the wall, out of the
way, and says, "Okay, the deck has just blown up.

2467
02:39:16,918 --> 02:39:21,510
"First position. And action."

2468
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:31,343
ASHLEY: "You knew this was gonna happen. The
entire time, you were biding your time, and now

2469
02:39:31,343 --> 02:39:33,880
"you're driving this fleet into the ground!"

2470
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:40,768
MATT: "The Federation is crumbling. You know that.
Everyone on this ship knows it. You can't stop the

2471
02:39:40,768 --> 02:39:42,480
"inevitable, Cass."

2472
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:47,318
SAM: (yells in pain) Pickup. (yells in pain)

2473
02:39:47,318 --> 02:39:48,520
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany--"

2474
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:53,270
SAM: Pickup. (yells in pain) "Oh, god!"

2475
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:57,607
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt,
bad!"

2476
02:39:57,607 --> 02:40:01,052
MARISHA: "We're not gonna have a problem here, are
we, Commander?"

2477
02:40:01,052 --> 02:40:04,806
TRAVIS: "Well, that's gonna fucking depend on you,
isn't it?"

2478
02:40:04,806 --> 02:40:08,356
MATT: "Well? What's it gonna be, Cass?"

2479
02:40:08,356 --> 02:40:11,560
ASHLEY: "God damn it!"

2480
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:19,993
LIAM: Laura runs in from the side. "Cass! He set
it loose! Argus! He's killed us all!" She's 12.

2481
02:40:19,993 --> 02:40:25,042
"Explosion!"

2482
02:40:25,042 --> 02:40:27,896
(yelling)

2483
02:40:27,896 --> 02:40:29,979
MATT: All right, T-pose.

2484
02:40:29,979 --> 02:40:32,320
SAM: Man, her South African accent is terrible.

2485
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:33,661
(laughter)

2486
02:40:33,661 --> 02:40:35,558
TALIESIN: All over the place.

2487
02:40:35,558 --> 02:40:42,607
LIAM: Neil is laughing off to the side, and says,
"Okay, did we get the April Fools' take out of the

2488
02:40:42,607 --> 02:40:44,880
"way? I mean, I don't understand."

2489
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:47,642
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2490
02:40:47,642 --> 02:40:50,679
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can do it for real. I think--

2491
02:40:50,679 --> 02:40:53,612
MARISHA: That was just rehearsal, right?

2492
02:40:53,612 --> 02:40:57,473
LIAM: "Yeah, it's all rehearsal, is kind of the
mindset."

2493
02:40:57,473 --> 02:40:59,901
ASHLEY: Anything else you want us to do?

2494
02:40:59,901 --> 02:41:07,850
LIAM: "Well, I mean, I don't want to give you a
result-oriented direction, but.

2495
02:41:07,850 --> 02:41:11,801
"Come over here for a second."

2496
02:41:11,801 --> 02:41:14,589
ASHLEY: You do him so good.

2497
02:41:14,589 --> 02:41:17,651
(laughter)

2498
02:41:17,651 --> 02:41:19,402
ASHLEY: Yes.

2499
02:41:19,402 --> 02:41:27,110
LIAM: "So I want it to come from you." I'm looking
for something in these notes, I can't find it.

2500
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:38,535
"And, you know, this time, when you're confronting
him, don't look right at him, look back at your

2501
02:41:38,535 --> 02:41:42,704
"men. And let's just see what that does."

2502
02:41:42,704 --> 02:41:44,413
ASHLEY: Okay.

2503
02:41:44,413 --> 02:41:47,762
LIAM: "Sam, do you have the line?"

2504
02:41:47,762 --> 02:41:53,783
SAM: Yeah, I got it now. Sorry, Neil. I didn't
know if it was "oh lord!" or "oh god!" I got in my

2505
02:41:53,783 --> 02:41:56,220
head, and that's not a place you want me to be.

2506
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:00,468
LIAM: "Well, that's okay, even if you lose the
lines, just play it through to the end. You know,

2507
02:42:00,468 --> 02:42:02,638
"we can use it."

2508
02:42:02,638 --> 02:42:04,707
SAM: Hey, can I see you for a second?

2509
02:42:04,707 --> 02:42:05,898
LIAM: "Sure."

2510
02:42:05,898 --> 02:42:10,224
SAM: Laura's accent is really throwing me. That's
gonna be fixed later, right?

2511
02:42:10,224 --> 02:42:13,434
LIAM: "Yeah."

2512
02:42:13,434 --> 02:42:16,219
SAM: Okay, okay. I can do this.

2513
02:42:16,219 --> 02:42:20,567
LIAM: Shakes his head, walks back to the side.

2514
02:42:20,567 --> 02:42:22,107
TRAVIS: Bill? Beemer?

2515
02:42:22,107 --> 02:42:23,379
LIAM: "Yeah?"

2516
02:42:23,379 --> 02:42:28,436
TRAVIS: Hey, Bill, what time is it, man? How long
have we been here?

2517
02:42:28,436 --> 02:42:33,521
LIAM: "Two hours? What is it, 9:30?"

2518
02:42:33,521 --> 02:42:35,631
TRAVIS: 9:30, okay, yeah.

2519
02:42:35,631 --> 02:42:37,123
MARISHA: 405 traffic.

2520
02:42:37,123 --> 02:42:39,403
TRAVIS: Right, okay.

2521
02:42:39,403 --> 02:42:46,711
LIAM: "Okay, okay, I feel like we're losing
momentum, so let's just do one more, we'll go one

2522
02:42:46,711 --> 02:42:54,102
"more time. Bill?" And Bill comes out and says,
"All right, Savage Starlight, scene 23B, take

2523
02:42:54,102 --> 02:43:07,114
"four. Audio rolling. Camera rolling. All right.
You're good to go."

2524
02:43:07,114 --> 02:43:12,847
And Neil shouts, "Explosion! And action."

2525
02:43:12,847 --> 02:43:18,118
ASHLEY: "You knew this was gonna happen. The
entire time, you were biding your time, and now you're

2526
02:43:18,118 --> 02:43:20,261
"driving this fleet to the ground!"

2527
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:27,586
MATT: "The Federation is crumbling. You know that.
Everyone on this ship knows it. You can't stop the

2528
02:43:27,586 --> 02:43:28,975
"inevitable, Cass."

2529
02:43:28,975 --> 02:43:32,640
SAM: (yells in pain) "Oh, god! Oh, god!"

2530
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:37,695
TALIESIN: "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt.
Bad."

2531
02:43:37,695 --> 02:43:46,433
LIAM: Right at that moment, you feel the same
sickening nauseating pull on your every nerve,

2532
02:43:46,433 --> 02:43:54,862
your guts feel like they're going to drop out of
your body, and an invisible wall of force, like a

2533
02:43:54,862 --> 02:44:03,877
sheet of radiation pushes its way through your
body, and as it does so, the ground around you,

2534
02:44:03,877 --> 02:44:12,262
the walls of the performance-capture studio split
and break in places, and tendrils of cable, oily

2535
02:44:12,262 --> 02:44:18,967
and slick, spatter out like a digusting birth of
pythons wriggling and spreading out on the floor.

2536
02:44:18,967 --> 02:44:26,644
And the wall's a techno-organic orgy spewing with
malice all around you. The camera equipment around

2537
02:44:26,644 --> 02:44:35,693
you begins to twist and break and reconfigure in
disjointed movements, reforming into broken,

2538
02:44:35,693 --> 02:44:44,096
misshapen, spider-like legs, masses of metal and
power cables either cut loose from them or spool

2539
02:44:44,096 --> 02:44:53,606
around their bodies, these things. Before you can
react, you watch as Colla, the cameraman, is

2540
02:44:53,606 --> 02:44:59,871
pushed down onto the ground and mangled by
spinning metallic arms on the bottom of what used

2541
02:44:59,871 --> 02:45:01,322
to be a camera.

2542
02:45:01,322 --> 02:45:03,252
TRAVIS: He's ripped!

2543
02:45:03,252 --> 02:45:11,053
LIAM: Neil, stunned, backs up. "I-- I-- I--" Roll
for initiative.

2544
02:45:11,053 --> 02:45:12,923
(yelling)

2545
02:45:12,923 --> 02:45:14,084
SAM: What are we fighting?

2546
02:45:14,084 --> 02:45:15,181
ASHLEY: Are fighting Colla?

2547
02:45:15,181 --> 02:45:17,590
MARISHA: But the sides were so mediocre!

2548
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:20,983
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

2549
02:45:20,983 --> 02:45:25,595
SAM: What are we fighting?

2550
02:45:25,595 --> 02:45:34,216
TRAVIS: (laughs) It's actually-- you fucking made
it. It's Sony.

2551
02:45:34,216 --> 02:45:35,954
MATT: Yeah, it is.

2552
02:45:35,954 --> 02:45:39,804
MARISHA: Oh my god, it is. Look! Look, it's the
control room!

2553
02:45:39,804 --> 02:45:42,624
MATT: I love that it has the volume tape and
everything. It's so good.

2554
02:45:42,624 --> 02:45:46,696
LIAM: This is a miniature of Rasputin. And now
it's Neil Druckmann.

2555
02:45:46,696 --> 02:45:49,759
(laughter)

2556
02:45:49,759 --> 02:45:52,560
MATT: I feel like you have to give him that after
this, now.

2557
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:57,351
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I think that's-- won't be
needing that anymore. Okay. So. Oh, Neil needs to

2558
02:45:57,351 --> 02:45:59,428
roll for-- and so does Laura.

2559
02:45:59,428 --> 02:46:01,380
MARISHA: Where's Crafty?

2560
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:02,776
TRAVIS: Outside, unfortunately.

2561
02:46:02,776 --> 02:46:07,749
MARISHA: God damn, every time, and we have to
share it with the other stage. Bullshit.

2562
02:46:07,749 --> 02:46:10,212
SAM: Ashley has a prop knife.

2563
02:46:10,212 --> 02:46:12,629
LIAM: Okay, 20 to 25?

2564
02:46:12,629 --> 02:46:14,624
ASHLEY: 20.

2565
02:46:14,624 --> 02:46:18,198
LIAM: Yeah? Okay. 15 to 20?

2566
02:46:18,198 --> 02:46:19,340
MATT: 18.

2567
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,022
LIAM: 18. Ten to 15?

2568
02:46:22,022 --> 02:46:23,657
MARISHA: 14.

2569
02:46:23,657 --> 02:46:36,473
LIAM: Five to ten? Okay, so that is-- oh, I can do
Laura and Neil. And then zero to five?

2570
02:46:36,473 --> 02:46:37,378
SAM: Three.

2571
02:46:37,378 --> 02:46:38,205
TALIESIN: Two.

2572
02:46:38,205 --> 02:46:39,483
TRAVIS: Natural one.

2573
02:46:39,483 --> 02:46:40,584
LIAM: Whoa!

2574
02:46:40,584 --> 02:46:42,346
MATT: Aw, buddy.

2575
02:46:42,346 --> 02:46:55,336
LIAM: Three, two, one? Wow. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay.
So Colla is soup on the ground, and everything's

2576
02:46:55,336 --> 02:47:04,802
broken and bent all around you. You also see one
of the computer banks up on the platform here, the

2577
02:47:04,802 --> 02:47:10,500
computers have wrapped together and formed into a
sort of walking tank. Rickety, but has closed on

2578
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:16,487
the sofa, where Liam was taking a nap. What would
you like to do?

2579
02:47:16,487 --> 02:47:20,777
ASHLEY: (laughs) Where am I?

2580
02:47:20,777 --> 02:47:23,519
LIAM: Yeah, I'm gonna have to help you all. You
are right here.

2581
02:47:23,519 --> 02:47:24,530
ASHLEY: Okay.

2582
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:26,265
SAM: And there's robits?

2583
02:47:26,265 --> 02:47:29,939
LIAM: There's camera and mocap-- this thing came
out of the ground.

2584
02:47:29,939 --> 02:47:31,106
SAM: What is it?

2585
02:47:31,106 --> 02:47:32,384
LIAM: I don't know.

2586
02:47:32,384 --> 02:47:33,930
SAM: What does it look like?

2587
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:41,225
LIAM: It looks like black poles and computer
monitor and cables and cords and exposed wiring

2588
02:47:41,225 --> 02:47:48,514
and motherboards wrapped together, and rickety,
but moving, and everything else, these other ones,

2589
02:47:48,514 --> 02:47:55,694
were things that were out and just wrapped
together. This broke out of the floor. And

2590
02:47:55,694 --> 02:47:56,866
Ashley's right here.

2591
02:47:56,866 --> 02:47:58,008
ASHLEY: And Colla's on the ground?

2592
02:47:58,008 --> 02:48:00,876
LIAM: Colla is here, and is guts.

2593
02:48:00,876 --> 02:48:02,122
ASHLEY: He's dead.

2594
02:48:02,122 --> 02:48:04,931
LIAM: He's gone. The cameraman.

2595
02:48:04,931 --> 02:48:14,644
ASHLEY: Sorry, Colla. And what's the other-- is
that just another camera? Behind? Yeah, that.

2596
02:48:14,644 --> 02:48:20,923
LIAM: This is camera, camera, computers,
computers, nightmare-fuel.

2597
02:48:20,923 --> 02:48:24,827
ASHLEY: So the thing that we're trying to kill is
that one? Or are all the cameras bad?

2598
02:48:24,827 --> 02:48:26,399
We don't know.

2599
02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:38,373
LIAM: And the crew that are scattered around on
the outskirts are running. All the people over

2600
02:48:38,373 --> 02:48:41,924
here, I don't have minis for them all, but they're
all booking for the door.

2601
02:48:41,924 --> 02:48:45,421
One person ran out here.

2602
02:48:45,421 --> 02:48:47,087
ASHLEY: Okay.

2603
02:48:47,087 --> 02:48:48,867
MARISHA: So they can see the crazy.

2604
02:48:48,867 --> 02:48:50,994
LIAM: Everyone sees the crazy. You're still kids.

2605
02:48:50,994 --> 02:48:55,362
MARISHA: According to us. No one else.

2606
02:48:55,362 --> 02:49:01,238
LIAM: Can tell that you're kids? Yeah, no one has
acknowledged that you're kids, and they've got

2607
02:49:01,238 --> 02:49:03,473
bigger fish to fry at the moment.

2608
02:49:03,473 --> 02:49:04,845
MARISHA: Production.

2609
02:49:04,845 --> 02:49:10,054
ASHLEY: Liam! Are you okay?

2610
02:49:10,054 --> 02:49:12,715
LIAM: (shrieks)

2611
02:49:12,715 --> 02:49:17,475
ASHLEY: I'll take that as a yes, 'cause that means
you're alive.

2612
02:49:17,475 --> 02:49:19,286
TRAVIS: That was adult-Liam, too.

2613
02:49:19,286 --> 02:49:20,763
MATT: Yeah. Yeah.

2614
02:49:20,763 --> 02:49:23,471
LIAM: True to life. True to life.

2615
02:49:23,471 --> 02:49:30,456
ASHLEY: Ah, man. How close can I get to one of the
cameras? The ones behind?

2616
02:49:30,456 --> 02:49:35,373
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. You can get right up
on this one or this one. This one killed Colla.

2617
02:49:35,373 --> 02:49:40,664
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. I don't have anything to do to
it. Oh, shoot, I don't know what to do!

2618
02:49:40,664 --> 02:49:43,933
LIAM: Well, I'm gonna pass to Matt in another 20
seconds.

2619
02:49:43,933 --> 02:49:44,862
ASHLEY: Okay.

2620
02:49:44,862 --> 02:49:46,408
MARISHA: You're Ashley motherfucking Johnson.

2621
02:49:46,408 --> 02:49:49,261
ASHLEY: I'm gonna try-- I don't know what-- that
doesn't mean-- are there any wires that're exposed

2622
02:49:49,261 --> 02:49:50,519
on the biggie?

2623
02:49:50,519 --> 02:49:52,286
TRAVIS: Take a bite out of Sam.

2624
02:49:52,286 --> 02:49:57,570
LIAM: It's all wires. There's no hardened shell,
this isn't a military machine cased inside of

2625
02:49:57,570 --> 02:50:00,904
armor, it's all just a mess of motherboard and
wires.

2626
02:50:00,904 --> 02:50:04,840
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm gonna try to go to the big
camera.

2627
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:05,914
LIAM: Yeah.

2628
02:50:05,914 --> 02:50:09,360
ASHLEY: And start yanking some wires, maybe where
I think it can't see me.

2629
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:16,447
LIAM: Okay. Where it can't see you? Okay. So
you're gonna reach out? Well, make an attack. Roll

2630
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:17,752
a d20.

2631
02:50:17,752 --> 02:50:22,298
ASHLEY: Okay. And then what do I add to it?

2632
02:50:22,298 --> 02:50:27,466
LIAM: Your strength modifier. Well, to hit? Yeah.

2633
02:50:27,466 --> 02:50:36,270
ASHLEY: A nine. And I do add the strength? Okay.
Yeah, so, 11.

2634
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:40,352
LIAM: You get your hands on there and you pull,
and nothing fucking happens.

2635
02:50:40,352 --> 02:50:46,828
ASHLEY: Shit. Knew I shouldn't have rolled that
one. I knew it was a bad die.

2636
02:50:46,828 --> 02:50:48,409
LIAM: What do you wanna do, Matt?

2637
02:50:48,409 --> 02:50:51,603
MATT: Just looking around at the ground, these
things are made of cables. Are there loose, slack

2638
02:50:51,603 --> 02:50:53,428
cables that were once attached to the cameras?

2639
02:50:53,428 --> 02:50:57,149
LIAM: Sure, there's a lot of shit scattered
around. When they formed, some pieces just fell

2640
02:50:57,149 --> 02:51:00,020
away, so there's bits of pole and--

2641
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:07,610
MATT: Okay. I'm gonna move slightly around and
towards the consoles a bit, grabbing whatever

2642
02:51:07,610 --> 02:51:10,990
looks to be longest, most slack non-attached
wire--

2643
02:51:10,990 --> 02:51:12,289
LIAM: Wire, okay.

2644
02:51:12,289 --> 02:51:16,676
MATT: And I'm gonna grab it and throw it up over
the scaffolding that holds the various mocap

2645
02:51:16,676 --> 02:51:22,398
cameras there. Grab the other side and look back
to Marisha and be like, help me pull this onto it

2646
02:51:22,398 --> 02:51:27,349
and start backing up towards her the rest of my
movement, holding the cables that are wrapped

2647
02:51:27,349 --> 02:51:28,518
around the scaffolding.

2648
02:51:28,518 --> 02:51:32,680
LIAM: Okay. I'm gonna say that that's your whole
turn, getting it primed and ready. Yes.

2649
02:51:32,680 --> 02:51:33,818
MARISHA: What?

2650
02:51:33,818 --> 02:51:35,867
MATT: Trying to pull the scaffolding onto it.

2651
02:51:35,867 --> 02:51:37,575
LIAM: All right, Marisha.

2652
02:51:37,575 --> 02:51:38,835
MARISHA: Huh?

2653
02:51:38,835 --> 02:51:41,648
LIAM: 16-year-old in a mocap suit. What do you
want to do?

2654
02:51:41,648 --> 02:51:56,383
MARISHA: I thought I'd be famous by now. Okay.
Wait. What? You're pulling-- okay. I'm gonna look

2655
02:51:56,383 --> 02:51:58,469
for its power source.

2656
02:51:58,469 --> 02:52:01,560
LIAM: All right. Make an investigation check.

2657
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:04,053
SAM: There's a diesel engine.

2658
02:52:04,053 --> 02:52:07,352
MARISHA: Aw, that's not too bad. 14.

2659
02:52:07,352 --> 02:52:16,684
LIAM: 14. Well, there is-- I mean, it's climbing
out of a gap in the ground, right? And there is a

2660
02:52:16,684 --> 02:52:26,215
sickly green light glowing from under its butt.
And there are also, you see, two little screens.

2661
02:52:26,215 --> 02:52:32,750
You see a broken fragment of monitor, and then a
very small, almost like a flip-up on a camera

2662
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:41,700
screen, and on it you see the word flicker on,
"NO". And then it disappears. And you see the

2663
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:47,899
same-- and it's like a pale green. And you see
that same color glowing from underneath this big,

2664
02:52:47,899 --> 02:52:49,893
spherical body.

2665
02:52:49,893 --> 02:53:02,551
MARISHA: Is there a cord connected to that? No?
Ah, jeez. Okay. I say, I feel like this is a

2666
02:53:02,551 --> 02:53:10,498
really shitty update. And then I'm gonna try and
punch it in its face.

2667
02:53:10,498 --> 02:53:13,081
SAM: Punch the camera.

2668
02:53:13,081 --> 02:53:17,855
LIAM: So Matt is there going, come on, come on,
and she just runs up and starts fucking whaling on

2669
02:53:17,855 --> 02:53:19,047
it like a brawler.

2670
02:53:19,047 --> 02:53:21,301
MATT: Yeah, no, this is a familiar duality, here.

2671
02:53:21,301 --> 02:53:23,018
LIAM: Yeah, that's about right.

2672
02:53:23,018 --> 02:53:24,865
MATT: I have a plan, what are you-- okay.

2673
02:53:24,865 --> 02:53:26,137
MARISHA: Ten for the first one.

2674
02:53:26,137 --> 02:53:27,892
LIAM: What about the second? Just roll for both.

2675
02:53:27,892 --> 02:53:34,454
MARISHA: Second one is real bad. Real bad. That's
a four. No, five.

2676
02:53:34,454 --> 02:53:38,894
LIAM: Okay, you just start whaling-- and you've
trained, you know some martial arts, so you pull

2677
02:53:38,894 --> 02:53:39,896
out some of your--

2678
02:53:39,896 --> 02:53:41,256
MARISHA: No, no, five plus two. Seven.

2679
02:53:41,256 --> 02:53:45,758
LIAM: Okay, you pull out a little bit of your
training, and you get (impact sounds) and it

2680
02:53:45,758 --> 02:53:51,331
fucking hurts your knuckles and you dented it and
it just goes (whirring sounds) and that's the end

2681
02:53:51,331 --> 02:53:53,077
of your turn.

2682
02:53:53,077 --> 02:53:57,837
MARISHA: Fuck, this is like a claw machine! Fuck
that, it's rigged. (yells)

2683
02:53:57,837 --> 02:54:02,507
MATT: As you do that, I'm like, I told you to-- my
dick's in the wind, here, somebody help me!

2684
02:54:02,507 --> 02:54:14,097
LIAM: Laura screams, Neil! Run! And she runs at
this thing and grabs a piece of-- like the end of

2685
02:54:14,097 --> 02:54:20,285
a tripod, like a tripod leg from a camera, she
picks it up and swings down and whacks at this

2686
02:54:20,285 --> 02:54:31,970
thing and hurts it. She smashes off this, whatever
this spherical piece is, so it's without a top.

2687
02:54:31,970 --> 02:54:39,649
And she gets, okay. Good. You guys don't need to
know. All right, she smashes it and a whole piece

2688
02:54:39,649 --> 02:54:45,728
breaks off. They're not-- except for this guy--
they're not that solidly built, and she snaps the

2689
02:54:45,728 --> 02:54:51,141
connection where this round part is, and it breaks
off and hangs limply, but it's still moving, it

2690
02:54:51,141 --> 02:54:56,906
goes, (whirring sounds).

2691
02:54:56,906 --> 02:54:58,929
TRAVIS: Get him out of the volume!

2692
02:54:58,929 --> 02:55:05,440
LIAM: Neil runs over and he just jumps on top of
it. Because one of his favorite friends is there.

2693
02:55:05,440 --> 02:55:15,689
Oh, man. I'm sorry, Neil. You rolled a natural
one. He jumps and climbs and scrabbles up it and

2694
02:55:15,689 --> 02:55:22,949
goes, (yells), and his beard is just blowing in
the wind that doesn't exist, and his foot slips

2695
02:55:22,949 --> 02:55:29,093
and he falls backward and lands flat on his back
and knocks the wind out of himself. And has just

2696
02:55:29,093 --> 02:55:36,540
fallen prone on the ground. It was a one. Sam,
what do you wanna do?

2697
02:55:36,540 --> 02:55:42,561
SAM: I'm going to go assist Matt in what his plan
was. So are we grabbing the same thing and

2698
02:55:42,561 --> 02:55:43,658
pulling?

2699
02:55:43,658 --> 02:55:46,488
MATT: Yeah, the cables have wrapped around the
scaffolding that holds the mocap cameras, and

2700
02:55:46,488 --> 02:55:48,794
trying to pull it down onto the large IMC to pin
it.

2701
02:55:48,794 --> 02:55:51,432
SAM: I'm gonna pull hard. Real hard.

2702
02:55:51,432 --> 02:55:55,606
LIAM: Okay. Make a strength check with advantage.

2703
02:55:55,606 --> 02:55:59,885
SAM: Yeah, sure. Okay, terrible.

2704
02:55:59,885 --> 02:56:01,588
MATT: You still have your bardic inspiration.

2705
02:56:01,588 --> 02:56:06,859
SAM: I do. I'll use it. That helps. Plus
strength?

2706
02:56:06,859 --> 02:56:08,013
LIAM: Strength.

2707
02:56:08,013 --> 02:56:09,353
SAM: Okay, that's ten.

2708
02:56:09,353 --> 02:56:12,140
LIAM: A ten? That's the number I was imagining.

2709
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:17,773
SAM: Oh wait, no. Five plus one plus six is 12.

2710
02:56:17,773 --> 02:56:24,052
LIAM: 12. You guys, at the same time, go (effort
sounds), and you pull, and the thing goes

2711
02:56:24,052 --> 02:56:31,474
(shrieking metal), and a huge piece of it swings
down and goes in an arch and smacks into-- I think

2712
02:56:31,474 --> 02:56:35,324
you were maybe imagining bringing the whole thing
down, but you broke it, and a piece swings down and

2713
02:56:35,324 --> 02:56:37,819
goes (impact sound). Smashes into it for--

2714
02:56:37,870 --> 02:56:39,431
SAM: Hey, it's good.

2715
02:56:39,431 --> 02:56:40,851
LIAM: Okay.

2716
02:56:40,851 --> 02:56:43,737
MARISHA: I'm still looking for a mini-USB port.

2717
02:56:43,737 --> 02:56:48,584
LIAM: Smashes into the side and breaks away one of
five-- I know that's four-- but one of five legs

2718
02:56:48,584 --> 02:56:55,645
totally snaps and breaks off, and Sam, as you yank
and you watch it smash into it and it rights

2719
02:56:55,645 --> 02:57:01,299
itself, you see the same two screens, the fragment
of one, and the little one that Marisha saw, and

2720
02:57:01,299 --> 02:57:07,913
you see a name blink up, and it says, "SAM", and
it's gone. Taliesin.

2721
02:57:07,913 --> 02:57:16,569
TALIESIN: This is still a dream, so I'm going to
see if this thing still works.

2722
02:57:16,569 --> 02:57:19,096
LIAM: Go for it, yeah, absolutely.

2723
02:57:19,096 --> 02:57:22,659
TALIESIN: Is the one that Laura attacked still
looking dangerous, or is it just looking

2724
02:57:22,659 --> 02:57:23,888
irritated?

2725
02:57:23,888 --> 02:57:30,120
LIAM: It looked kind of fucked up from the get-go,
but it looks majorly fucked up, a couple of sparks

2726
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:32,340
fly off of it just as you look.

2727
02:57:32,340 --> 02:57:36,702
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to go to the one that no
one's messed with and just hope that this is still

2728
02:57:36,702 --> 02:57:37,900
gonna work.

2729
02:57:37,900 --> 02:57:40,109
LIAM: Okay, make a ranged attack.

2730
02:57:40,109 --> 02:57:42,501
MATT: Yeah, it's not focus-fire.

2731
02:57:42,501 --> 02:57:44,059
TALIESIN: That's a 23.

2732
02:57:44,059 --> 02:57:52,061
LIAM: Yeah, your eyes glow a dark blackish-purple.
This is the life you were meant for, Taliesin

2733
02:57:52,061 --> 02:57:58,241
Jaffe. And you don't slam your hand down into the
ground. You're going for this guy, right?

2734
02:57:58,241 --> 02:57:59,578
TALIESIN: I was going for the other one.

2735
02:57:59,578 --> 02:58:00,466
LIAM: The big one?

2736
02:58:00,466 --> 02:58:01,986
TALIESIN: No, the one in the far corner.

2737
02:58:01,986 --> 02:58:06,156
LIAM: The far corner? Oh, okay. You still don't
put your hand on the ground, you just reach out of

2738
02:58:06,156 --> 02:58:14,030
anger, you're so furious that fucking demogorgon
didn't take your bargain, and a long spaghetti arm

2739
02:58:14,030 --> 02:58:22,633
of hentai lashes out from your hand and reaches
across the room and spikes through its "head",

2740
02:58:22,633 --> 02:58:25,876
seemingly. Roll for damage.

2741
02:58:25,876 --> 02:58:27,211
SAM: Two.

2742
02:58:27,211 --> 02:58:28,498
TALIESIN: Four.

2743
02:58:28,498 --> 02:58:35,581
LIAM: Four. It goes right through the heart of it
and breaks the connection from what would be its

2744
02:58:35,581 --> 02:58:41,181
head if it was a head, and it swings down and
hangs limply from the side, and it starts to juke

2745
02:58:41,181 --> 02:58:45,041
to the side here. It's still standing.

2746
02:58:45,041 --> 02:58:49,109
TALIESIN: Liam, are you okay? And I'm going to run
just to the edge of the volume.

2747
02:58:49,109 --> 02:58:52,403
LIAM: Okay. Travis, you're up.

2748
02:58:52,403 --> 02:58:53,920
TRAVIS: Well, where am I?

2749
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:55,412
LIAM: You are here.

2750
02:58:55,412 --> 02:59:02,611
TRAVIS: Right there. I'm gonna take off the
certainly at this point very hot battery pack that

2751
02:59:02,611 --> 02:59:10,793
is attached to my stomach, peel it off the velcro,
and I'm gonna run at the giant arachnid demon

2752
02:59:10,793 --> 02:59:14,964
thing and I'm gonna bash one of its legs with the
hot battery.

2753
02:59:14,964 --> 02:59:20,194
LIAM: Okay. All right, roll for an attack.

2754
02:59:20,194 --> 02:59:23,613
TRAVIS: 14.

2755
02:59:23,613 --> 02:59:34,338
LIAM: You smash it with this piece of equipment,
and the equipment in your hand breaks into pieces

2756
02:59:34,338 --> 02:59:38,055
and does nothing.

2757
02:59:38,055 --> 02:59:43,592
TRAVIS: Yeah. Cool. Nice. Can I look up at it, see
if it flashes anything at me?

2758
02:59:43,592 --> 02:59:50,130
LIAM: It doesn't do anything. Another day in hell,
Travis, another day in hell. And it goes (whirring

2759
02:59:50,130 --> 02:59:58,302
noises) and two legs go (mechanical noises) and
dig into the side of your body.

2760
02:59:58,302 --> 03:00:01,425
(yelling)

2761
03:00:01,425 --> 03:00:04,108
LIAM: What's your armor class?

2762
03:00:04,108 --> 03:00:06,153
TRAVIS: 12.

2763
03:00:06,153 --> 03:00:14,977
LIAM: Okay. Too bad, so sad. All right. One stabs
into your thigh right here, and one goes in right

2764
03:00:15,161 --> 03:00:19,544
under your armpit, and you can feel them dig in,
and each goes in-- again, these things are scary,

2765
03:00:19,544 --> 03:00:25,458
I mean, camera equipment is not supposed to move
on its own, but they're not mecha from Metal

2766
03:00:25,458 --> 03:00:30,546
Gear-- but you are stabbed here and here, and it
slices in about an inch and a half on each side.

2767
03:00:30,546 --> 03:00:32,671
You take two points of damage.

2768
03:00:32,671 --> 03:00:34,657
TRAVIS: That's a lot for me.

2769
03:00:34,657 --> 03:00:45,339
LIAM: Off in the distance, you hear (whirring
sounds), and then you hear (screams, gurgling).

2770
03:00:45,339 --> 03:00:50,301
SAM: Liam's dead. That's okay.

2771
03:00:50,301 --> 03:00:53,730
TALIESIN: That's okay. He would've wanted it that
way. Wait.

2772
03:00:53,730 --> 03:00:56,420
SAM: He slowed us down.

2773
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:58,627
MATT: To be fair, he wrote this. So.

2774
03:00:58,627 --> 03:01:03,590
LIAM: This thing is broken and tries to-- raises a
leg up, it goes (whirring sounds) and brings it

2775
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:09,002
down at Druckmann and slams it down, and Druckmann
goes (effort sounds) and he rolls out of the way

2776
03:01:09,002 --> 03:01:21,120
of one and is missed. And then this thing. Oh.
What's your armor class?

2777
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:24,499
ASHLEY: I'm sure you beat it by that 'oh'. 12.

2778
03:01:24,499 --> 03:01:33,721
LIAM: 12. Yes. You feel a broken sharp-edged
tripod leg stab through here and come out here.

2779
03:01:33,721 --> 03:01:37,108
You take five hit points of damage. You are
bleeding profusely from

2780
03:01:37,108 --> 03:01:38,956
the front of yourself now.

2781
03:01:38,956 --> 03:01:42,004
TRAVIS: Five, that's a lot.

2782
03:01:42,004 --> 03:01:43,834
SAM: You okay there?

2783
03:01:43,834 --> 03:01:49,320
LIAM: And, funnily enough, it's the top of round.
So what would you like to do with an arm still

2784
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:51,452
pushed through your body?

2785
03:01:51,452 --> 03:01:54,072
ASHLEY: Okay.

2786
03:01:54,072 --> 03:01:55,875
LIAM: It hurts.

2787
03:01:55,875 --> 03:02:02,612
ASHLEY: I can't take it out 'cause I'll bleed out.
Is there any way to break off the arm?

2788
03:02:02,612 --> 03:02:04,729
LIAM: Sure, you can hit that motherfucker.

2789
03:02:04,729 --> 03:02:09,204
ASHLEY: All right. I'm gonna use my mocap knife.

2790
03:02:09,204 --> 03:02:10,326
LIAM: Okay.

2791
03:02:10,326 --> 03:02:12,254
(laughter)

2792
03:02:12,254 --> 03:02:13,609
LIAM: Roll to attack.

2793
03:02:13,609 --> 03:02:15,682
ASHLEY: Those are actually pretty strong.

2794
03:02:15,682 --> 03:02:18,060
TRAVIS: Masking tape and 'Ashley' written on it.

2795
03:02:18,060 --> 03:02:22,401
MATT: Well, if it's like the hardcover cast stuff,
then yeah, that could actually be substantial.

2796
03:02:22,401 --> 03:02:24,507
MARISHA: It could be a piece of plywood, it's hard
to say.

2797
03:02:24,507 --> 03:02:26,628
ASHLEY: Do I get advantage because it's mine?

2798
03:02:26,628 --> 03:02:31,519
LIAM: No, but you can add your proficiency bonus
'cause you're a rogue, and it's a dagger, and

2799
03:02:31,519 --> 03:02:34,664
your-- I'm gonna say strength here.

2800
03:02:34,664 --> 03:02:36,177
ASHLEY: So I would add both of those?

2801
03:02:36,177 --> 03:02:37,479
LIAM and MATT: Yes.

2802
03:02:37,479 --> 03:02:39,960
ASHLEY: 12.

2803
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:53,469
LIAM: Oh, girl. It's rubber. It just bends to the
side as soon as you stab it down. Matt? Oh yeah,

2804
03:02:53,469 --> 03:02:57,228
do you wanna do anything else, do you wanna pull
away?

2805
03:02:57,228 --> 03:03:06,624
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm just gonna ask-- yeah, 'cause
I can't attack again, obviously. I'm gonna ask the

2806
03:03:06,624 --> 03:03:11,501
big thing, talk to me, what do you want?

2807
03:03:11,501 --> 03:03:17,528
LIAM: On that broken piece of screen down the
side, you see the lower half, you can make it out,

2808
03:03:17,528 --> 03:03:24,579
it's fragmented but you can see most of the word
'FORGIVE M--' And it's gone.

2809
03:03:24,579 --> 03:03:28,449
MARISHA: Okay, so I got a 'NO', you got--

2810
03:03:28,449 --> 03:03:29,587
SAM: 'SAM'.

2811
03:03:29,587 --> 03:03:32,202
MARISHA: 'SAM'. And then he said 'FORGIVE'.

2812
03:03:32,202 --> 03:03:33,376
SAM: 'FORGIVE M--'

2813
03:03:33,376 --> 03:03:34,556
MARISHA: 'FORGIVE M--'

2814
03:03:34,556 --> 03:03:36,027
SAM: For killing people.

2815
03:03:36,027 --> 03:03:38,308
ASHLEY: 'FORGIVE M--' or 'FORGIVENESS'?

2816
03:03:38,308 --> 03:03:41,100
MARISHA: I got a 'NO', he got a 'SAM', you got a
'FORGIVE M--'

2817
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:42,869
LIAM: What would you like to do, Matt?

2818
03:03:42,869 --> 03:03:44,905
MATT: Well, I used all my spells in the previous
battles.

2819
03:03:44,905 --> 03:03:49,227
LIAM: Before this performance-capture stage?

2820
03:03:49,227 --> 03:03:50,451
MATT: Yeah.

2821
03:03:50,451 --> 03:03:52,954
LIAM: You still feel-- you feel magical.

2822
03:03:52,954 --> 03:03:55,056
SAM: Does everything reset?

2823
03:03:55,056 --> 03:04:01,958
MATT: Okay, well, that changes things. Well,
first, I'm gonna go ahead and say, it's all right,

2824
03:04:01,958 --> 03:04:06,327
Ashley, you've spent a lot of time in this volume
before, you're still the queen of it. So I'll give

2825
03:04:06,391 --> 03:04:08,050
you a Healing Word with my bonus action.

2826
03:04:08,050 --> 03:04:09,487
ASHLEY: Hey!

2827
03:04:09,487 --> 03:04:12,203
MATT: And that's a five, you heal five.

2828
03:04:12,203 --> 03:04:17,288
ASHLEY: Yay! Thanks, Matt. So clutch.

2829
03:04:17,288 --> 03:04:29,445
MATT: And I'm gonna go ahead... so the leg that
broke off? I'm gonna go ahead and rush over to

2830
03:04:29,445 --> 03:04:35,976
pick it up, and like a giant metal baseball bat,
swing back and try and hit back at it

2831
03:04:35,976 --> 03:04:37,284
with its own leg.

2832
03:04:37,284 --> 03:04:39,145
LIAM: Yeah, you are. Go for it.

2833
03:04:39,145 --> 03:04:43,780
MATT: So it's like (yells). Not very good with it.
Is this at disadvantage?

2834
03:04:43,780 --> 03:04:45,939
LIAM: At disadvantage?

2835
03:04:45,939 --> 03:04:48,087
MATT: I'm not proficient--

2836
03:04:48,087 --> 03:04:49,871
LIAM: Nah. You're-- nah.

2837
03:04:49,871 --> 03:04:54,909
MATT: All right, so we'll say-- that's a 19?
Natural.

2838
03:04:54,909 --> 03:04:55,876
LIAM: Yeah, man.

2839
03:04:55,876 --> 03:04:57,792
MATT: Two for strength.

2840
03:04:57,792 --> 03:05:01,233
LIAM: Two for strength. Yeah. Absolutely hits.
Clocked that motherfucker. Roll a d4.

2841
03:05:01,287 --> 03:05:05,927
MATT: That is a two plus two. Four damage.

2842
03:05:05,927 --> 03:05:10,795
LIAM: Okay. You break off-- you were trying to
break off a leg, you said?

2843
03:05:10,795 --> 03:05:12,492
MATT: Trying to hit one of the other legs, yeah.

2844
03:05:12,492 --> 03:05:16,011
LIAM: Yeah. It breaks. It smashes, and the thing
lurches down to the side.

2845
03:05:16,011 --> 03:05:19,494
MATT: Yeah, I'm not going for the core, I'm just
going for its means of attack.

2846
03:05:19,494 --> 03:05:24,015
LIAM: Right, right, right. And it falls right in
front of you, and now the little camcorder-sized

2847
03:05:24,015 --> 03:05:27,465
screen falls right in front of your face, and you
see 'FORGIVE ME'. Gone.

2848
03:05:27,465 --> 03:05:29,200
MARISHA: What?

2849
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:31,900
LIAM: Marisha, what would you like to do--

2850
03:05:31,900 --> 03:05:37,660
MATT: At the end of my turn, I shout, just 'cause
I'm really curious, let's not kill it yet, but

2851
03:05:37,660 --> 03:05:39,431
definitely disable it!

2852
03:05:39,431 --> 03:05:42,619
SAM: Noted.

2853
03:05:42,619 --> 03:05:44,516
LIAM: Marisha is up.

2854
03:05:44,516 --> 03:06:01,641
MARISHA: I look at Matt, and I say, don't kill it?
'Kay. And then I look for its memory card. It's

2855
03:06:01,641 --> 03:06:04,879
gotta have-- I'm thinking my production elements.

2856
03:06:04,879 --> 03:06:06,689
LIAM: Right, right, logic, I like it.

2857
03:06:06,689 --> 03:06:14,204
MARISHA: Yeah. It's gotta have a memory card
somewhere in there. How many gigs does it have?

2858
03:06:14,204 --> 03:06:18,522
It's hard to say. But if I immediately remove it.

2859
03:06:18,590 --> 03:06:25,801
LIAM: All right. Make an investigation check to
find its memory card.

2860
03:06:25,801 --> 03:06:33,100
MARISHA: Jesus fucking christ, all right. Oh my
god, that's a natural 20.

2861
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:36,688
MATT: On the Snitch? Well, on your Snitch.

2862
03:06:36,688 --> 03:06:38,483
MARISHA: See? Look at it.

2863
03:06:38,483 --> 03:06:39,969
MATT: Yeah, that's an actual natural 20.

2864
03:06:39,969 --> 03:06:41,436
MARISHA: It's a natural 20.

2865
03:06:41,436 --> 03:06:50,268
LIAM: Okay. You see on the bottom of it, like a
fucking outie belly button, a cylinder, and on the

2866
03:06:50,268 --> 03:06:53,468
end of the cylinder's a slot, and it says right
above it, 'SD'.

2867
03:06:53,468 --> 03:07:01,240
MARISHA: Like output? Is it output? And I'm just
gonna go click. And see if it pulls out.

2868
03:07:01,240 --> 03:07:06,540
LIAM: It doesn't... it doesn't.

2869
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:09,388
MARISHA: No? No pulling out of the SD card?

2870
03:07:09,388 --> 03:07:16,649
LIAM: No, you press it and-- I mean, it's going
(whirring sound) while you're doing this, you

2871
03:07:16,649 --> 03:07:18,556
definitely found something.

2872
03:07:18,556 --> 03:07:24,287
MARISHA: It's not connected to the cloud! They
don't have a backup drive!

2873
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:29,743
LIAM: But pressing in does not then detach an SD
card and give you photographs or

2874
03:07:29,743 --> 03:07:31,103
shut the thing down.

2875
03:07:31,103 --> 03:07:33,111
(laughter)

2876
03:07:33,111 --> 03:07:34,999
MARISHA: I'm just wondering if the memory card--

2877
03:07:34,999 --> 03:07:39,820
LIAM: But you did spend six seconds finding that
thing. And--

2878
03:07:39,820 --> 03:07:45,554
MARISHA: It does have a backup drive. It does not
matter, though. That's the important part, is that

2879
03:07:45,554 --> 03:07:48,091
no one cares that we have a backup.

2880
03:07:48,091 --> 03:07:52,336
LIAM: In a split-second, in your peripheral
vision, you see a light blink, but it's gone. You

2881
03:07:52,336 --> 03:07:54,885
didn't see what it said.

2882
03:07:54,885 --> 03:07:59,980
MARISHA: These people have very poor cloud
storage. That's all you need to know.

2883
03:07:59,980 --> 03:08:09,242
LIAM: Laura tries to get in front of Neil, and she
starts pulling on wires coming out of the thing's

2884
03:08:09,242 --> 03:08:13,920
head, and she yanks, but she's pulling, and it's
not doing anything. She's really little. Really

2885
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:19,255
cute. She's so small, and the wires are not coming
free, but she's trying, she's trying to save Neil

2886
03:08:19,255 --> 03:08:23,060
Druckmann. Sam, what do you want to do?

2887
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:32,625
SAM: Me? I mean, I don't really know what these
symbols and messages mean, so like the piece of

2888
03:08:32,625 --> 03:08:41,321
scaffolding that fell down like this, can I run
and sort of jump on it and do it again?

2889
03:08:41,321 --> 03:08:47,765
LIAM: Make an acrobatics check.

2890
03:08:47,765 --> 03:08:51,156
SAM: Okay. Four. (laughs)

2891
03:08:51,156 --> 03:08:59,038
LIAM: You run at this thing and you jump, and you
crush your nuts so hard on the side of this thing.

2892
03:08:59,038 --> 03:09:07,135
You just hit it and you slide down to the bottom
of it, and wish that you hadn't decided to do what

2893
03:09:07,135 --> 03:09:08,564
you just did.

2894
03:09:08,564 --> 03:09:14,174
SAM: And then I'll spend the rest of my
action/bonus or whatever looking at those screens

2895
03:09:14,174 --> 03:09:16,516
to see if they say anything to me.

2896
03:09:16,516 --> 03:09:18,174
LIAM: Yeah, it does, briefly.

2897
03:09:18,174 --> 03:09:19,418
SAM: What?

2898
03:09:19,418 --> 03:09:20,552
LIAM: 'HUSBAND'.

2899
03:09:20,552 --> 03:09:21,719
SAM: 'HUSBAND'?

2900
03:09:21,719 --> 03:09:25,280
LIAM: Taliesin, you're up.

2901
03:09:25,280 --> 03:09:30,218
SAM: (whispers) It's Liam. It's Liam.

2902
03:09:30,218 --> 03:09:34,130
MARISHA: They're not filming in 4K, it's fine,
just go.

2903
03:09:34,130 --> 03:09:40,888
TALIESIN: Without breaking eye contact with
Marisha, I send another tendril at the one that

2904
03:09:40,888 --> 03:09:42,526
won't stay down.

2905
03:09:42,526 --> 03:09:47,338
LIAM: This guy right here, right? This is the one.
Sure. Ranged attack. The prince of--

2906
03:09:47,338 --> 03:09:50,756
TALIESIN: 11.

2907
03:09:50,756 --> 03:09:59,984
LIAM: The tentacle does a great big display and
spirals around, and you look fucking fierce and it

2908
03:09:59,984 --> 03:10:03,679
matches the color of your hair. No it doesn't. No
it doesn't!

2909
03:10:03,679 --> 03:10:05,651
TALIESIN: It doesn't match the color of my hair.

2910
03:10:05,651 --> 03:10:11,263
LIAM: It matches the color of your in-person hair
right now. There we go. But it doesn't reach. It

2911
03:10:11,263 --> 03:10:16,081
falls short. We see a lot of rage and fury, but no
delivery.

2912
03:10:16,081 --> 03:10:23,059
TALIESIN: All right. And I'm going to back off a
bit, and I'm gonna also keep looking at those

2913
03:10:23,059 --> 03:10:25,543
screens to see if they say anything.

2914
03:10:25,543 --> 03:10:32,121
LIAM: No? No. Not right now. Not in that
split-second. Travis.

2915
03:10:32,121 --> 03:10:41,138
TRAVIS: Can I reach up to my mocap helmet and
wrench the little GoPro camera that's surrounded

2916
03:10:41,138 --> 03:10:42,543
by LED lights.

2917
03:10:42,543 --> 03:10:44,568
LIAM: Yes you can!

2918
03:10:44,568 --> 03:10:48,850
TRAVIS: Can I wrench it off and can I face it
towards it, go, backfeed!

2919
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:52,346
LIAM: You're using it like a talisman?

2920
03:10:52,508 --> 03:10:54,696
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, like little fucking
Hobbits, like you know,

2921
03:10:54,696 --> 03:10:56,795
little Bilbo did, using the--

2922
03:10:56,795 --> 03:10:59,007
MATT: The LED light that's always in our face.

2923
03:10:59,007 --> 03:11:04,792
LIAM: I'll tell you what, I will not give you
advantage, but I will give you a DM inspiration

2924
03:11:04,792 --> 03:11:07,834
die of a d6 to make an intimidation check.

2925
03:11:07,834 --> 03:11:11,892
TRAVIS: Yes! Okay. Ooh!

2926
03:11:11,892 --> 03:11:14,898
TALIESIN: Plus a d6.

2927
03:11:14,898 --> 03:11:16,340
TRAVIS: 27.

2928
03:11:16,340 --> 03:11:17,546
TALIESIN: Plus a d6.

2929
03:11:17,546 --> 03:11:18,776
LIAM: 27?

2930
03:11:18,776 --> 03:11:27,219
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, sorry. 21. Oh, I won't spend it
now. 21. 19 plus two.

2931
03:11:27,219 --> 03:11:32,592
LIAM: The thing lurches backwards for a bit, and
as it backs away from you, pulling away from that

2932
03:11:32,592 --> 03:11:37,806
metal, you see on the screen it says, 'TRAVIS,
NO'. And that disappears and it backs away,

2933
03:11:37,806 --> 03:11:44,679
pulling, dragging cords out of that hole. It can't
really get too far, because it's now you see that

2934
03:11:44,679 --> 03:11:49,375
it is connected down, it was sort of squatting,
hiding a lot of that shit because of the carnage

2935
03:11:49,375 --> 03:11:55,950
underneath it, but it is sort of tethered, not too
much. Do you wanna move, or are you good to go?

2936
03:11:55,950 --> 03:12:04,790
TRAVIS: It's Colla. Colla's in the machine. Oh,
no. Are we bolting for Crafty?

2937
03:12:04,790 --> 03:12:07,213
(laughter)

2938
03:12:07,213 --> 03:12:09,144
SAM: We're gonna get potato chips during this?

2939
03:12:09,144 --> 03:12:11,556
MARISHA: It depends. What did they have on
Crafty?

2940
03:12:11,556 --> 03:12:13,925
TRAVIS: They got ginger beer and all sorts of
shit.

2941
03:12:13,925 --> 03:12:15,575
MARISHA: Do they have trail mix?

2942
03:12:15,575 --> 03:12:17,961
TALIESIN: They're always out of health potions by
the time I get there.

2943
03:12:17,961 --> 03:12:21,065
TRAVIS: I am going to head for the door.

2944
03:12:21,065 --> 03:12:22,835
LIAM: Which one?

2945
03:12:22,835 --> 03:12:25,200
TRAVIS: The green one, down at the-- yeah. That
thing.

2946
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:26,340
LIAM: Okay.

2947
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:28,446
TRAVIS: As far as I can go.

2948
03:12:28,446 --> 03:12:33,273
LIAM: 25, 30. All right, that's as far as you can
go because you used your action to do what you

2949
03:12:33,273 --> 03:12:35,789
did. It was amazing. (laughs)

2950
03:12:35,789 --> 03:12:38,156
MATT: Fill out your 1089 before you go.

2951
03:12:38,156 --> 03:12:39,322
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2952
03:12:39,322 --> 03:12:46,399
LIAM: This mass of computer screens and keyboards
and other shit that you can't identify comes down

2953
03:12:46,399 --> 03:12:54,517
the ramp. Okay, that's as far as it gets--
actually, no, and it's right there, but it can't do

2954
03:12:54,733 --> 03:13:07,819
anything 'cause it spent its time getting there.
This thing just goes (clattering) but it is done.

2955
03:13:07,819 --> 03:13:11,161
This thing continues to batter Ashley.

2956
03:13:11,161 --> 03:13:12,666
ASHLEY: Isn't it my turn?

2957
03:13:12,666 --> 03:13:23,078
LIAM: No. Not yet. Oh. This thing tries to stick--
it pulls out the pole from inside your gut, and

2958
03:13:23,078 --> 03:13:27,880
you feel a little (fft) as it does so. It tries to go
in again, but you're ready for it, you know it's

2959
03:13:27,935 --> 03:13:39,253
right behind you, and you manage to swivel and
step out of the way. It misses. And big guy snaps

2960
03:13:39,253 --> 03:13:47,376
away and moves back in this direction and Marisha,
you're the only one who sees it,

2961
03:13:47,376 --> 03:13:48,529
but a screen says--

2962
03:13:48,529 --> 03:13:50,369
SAM: Don't I get an attack of opportunity?

2963
03:13:50,369 --> 03:13:51,674
LIAM: Yes, you do.

2964
03:13:51,674 --> 03:13:54,144
SAM: Yes. I'm gonna just try to kick it.

2965
03:13:54,144 --> 03:13:58,261
MATT: 'Cause when it moved back, it was not in
melee range--

2966
03:13:58,261 --> 03:14:05,260
LIAM: But he was on the beam that swung down into
it, and I'm gonna pretend like it

2967
03:14:05,260 --> 03:14:06,710
dragged along with.

2968
03:14:06,710 --> 03:14:08,269
MATT: I like it. Cool.

2969
03:14:08,269 --> 03:14:09,654
LIAM: Hey, we're making it all up as we go.

2970
03:14:09,654 --> 03:14:11,360
SAM: 11 plus something.

2971
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:16,998
LIAM: 11 plus something? What's your strength
modifier, it's on the left? One? Yeah, you're too

2972
03:14:16,998 --> 03:14:25,004
busy going (yells)-- jeez, sorry everybody. You're
moving in space on that piece of scaffolding, and

2973
03:14:25,004 --> 03:14:31,040
it just fucks up your aim. You don't do it.
Taliesin, devil-child, you're up.

2974
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:34,701
TALIESIN: No, that was a--

2975
03:14:34,701 --> 03:14:37,875
LIAM: Oh, that was its-- that's right. Ashley's
up.

2976
03:14:37,875 --> 03:14:43,794
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to--

2977
03:14:43,794 --> 03:14:47,577
MARISHA: You know you better than anyone.

2978
03:14:47,577 --> 03:14:56,953
ASHLEY: The 'HUSBAND' threw me off. I am going to
move further that way to get away from these two

2979
03:14:56,953 --> 03:14:58,389
that are there.

2980
03:14:58,389 --> 03:15:00,338
LIAM: You're going this way?

2981
03:15:00,338 --> 03:15:04,408
ASHLEY: Well, maybe just like out of range of
them, touching range. So maybe just like--

2982
03:15:04,408 --> 03:15:06,124
LIAM: But which direction? This direction?

2983
03:15:06,124 --> 03:15:07,279
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2984
03:15:07,279 --> 03:15:08,329
LIAM: You're stepping this way?

2985
03:15:08,329 --> 03:15:09,607
ASHLEY: Towards the lounge.

2986
03:15:09,607 --> 03:15:13,750
LIAM: Towards the lounge. As you do so, the thing
takes a swipe at you. What's your AC?

2987
03:15:13,750 --> 03:15:15,102
ASHLEY: 12.

2988
03:15:15,102 --> 03:15:17,059
LIAM: 12? Yep.

2989
03:15:17,059 --> 03:15:22,703
MATT: Velcro bodysuits don't offer a lot of armor
class protection.

2990
03:15:22,703 --> 03:15:27,763
LIAM: On a hinge, a pole just goes (whirring
sound) and you feel it slice the back of your neck

2991
03:15:27,763 --> 03:15:30,371
as you go, and it takes four hit points--

2992
03:15:30,371 --> 03:15:32,071
ASHLEY: Even with the helmet on?

2993
03:15:32,071 --> 03:15:38,350
LIAM: Yeah. It didn't hit the helmet, it hit the
neck. And you feel blood pouring down the back of

2994
03:15:38,350 --> 03:15:43,136
this mocap suit, pooling up around your waist. You
do get away from it. Did you want to go further

2995
03:15:43,136 --> 03:15:44,422
than that, or there?

2996
03:15:44,422 --> 03:15:46,811
ASHLEY: Yeah. I wanna go further in, towards the
lounge.

2997
03:15:46,811 --> 03:15:48,061
LIAM: Okay, so.

2998
03:15:48,061 --> 03:15:52,000
ASHLEY: But I wanna get in eyeshot of the big
computer dude.

2999
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:53,469
LIAM: This guy?

3000
03:15:53,469 --> 03:16:01,411
ASHLEY: Actually, I'm so sorry. I want to go
further in towards the bigger guy. But kinda walk

3001
03:16:01,411 --> 03:16:03,787
around so I don't get attacked by the other one.

3002
03:16:03,787 --> 03:16:10,816
LIAM: This is also a huge gap, so you could go--
you could get to there. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3003
03:16:10,816 --> 03:16:15,215
That's as far as you can get unless you keep
going, make a dash.

3004
03:16:15,215 --> 03:16:17,299
ASHLEY: I'll dash.

3005
03:16:17,299 --> 03:16:19,208
LIAM: Okay, you want to get right up to it?

3006
03:16:19,208 --> 03:16:20,316
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3007
03:16:20,316 --> 03:16:25,107
LIAM: All right, you're out of stuff, though.
You're right in the face of this thing, and the

3008
03:16:25,107 --> 03:16:29,036
screen briefly says 'ASH-O-LEE'. And then it's
gone.

3009
03:16:29,036 --> 03:16:38,490
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I just put down my mocap knife
on the ground?

3010
03:16:38,490 --> 03:16:39,868
LIAM: Yeah, you drop it.

3011
03:16:39,868 --> 03:16:49,237
ASHLEY: And say, I think you've created or done
something that's gotten out of hand,

3012
03:16:49,237 --> 03:16:56,430
and I forgive you.

3013
03:16:56,430 --> 03:16:58,491
LIAM: And now it's Matt's turn.

3014
03:16:58,491 --> 03:17:08,009
MATT: Okay. Is that me right next to the-- right
there, okay. If I can take two steps to get right

3015
03:17:08,009 --> 03:17:13,917
up to the edge of where it emerged from the floor,
and glance inside, what do I see below?

3016
03:17:13,917 --> 03:17:24,612
LIAM: You see a crack going down about eight feet,
and it is like five and a half, six feet wide at

3017
03:17:24,612 --> 03:17:32,520
the most. And you see lots of cables. It looks
like black spaghetti. And it's all cabled, but

3018
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:38,809
again, it's wet and oily. If you jumped down into
that, you would be disgusting.

3019
03:17:38,809 --> 03:17:39,851
MATT: Yeah.

3020
03:17:39,851 --> 03:17:42,292
SAM: Everything's wet in Liam's world.

3021
03:17:42,292 --> 03:17:43,959
LIAM: Yes, husband.

3022
03:17:43,959 --> 03:17:56,631
MATT: I'm going to, if I can, move along-- move
from your perspective this way two more squares,

3023
03:17:56,631 --> 03:17:59,983
and then jump across that little bit of the gap
that's there.

3024
03:17:59,983 --> 03:18:02,907
LIAM: Sure, you can make it, you can go one more
square.

3025
03:18:02,907 --> 03:18:04,328
MATT: No, right there's where I wanna stand.

3026
03:18:04,328 --> 03:18:05,434
LIAM: All right, great.

3027
03:18:05,434 --> 03:18:09,447
MATT: And I'm gonna go ahead and use Thunderwave
in front of me to try and blast them back and do

3028
03:18:09,447 --> 03:18:16,349
damage. As I rush forward, I jump across the way
and go (hesitant noises). And I realize that we

3029
03:18:16,349 --> 03:18:23,575
probably have a PA system set up, and I grab the
microphone on the edge of the head thing and just

3030
03:18:23,575 --> 03:18:30,498
go (screams) as loud as I can into the microphone.
Thinking that they probably have a feedback set up

3031
03:18:30,498 --> 03:18:31,943
in the cameras.

3032
03:18:31,943 --> 03:18:33,379
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

3033
03:18:33,379 --> 03:18:35,741
MATT: So that's a constitution saving throw for
both of them.

3034
03:18:35,741 --> 03:18:40,014
LIAM: Okay. And the DC is?

3035
03:18:40,014 --> 03:18:41,754
MATT: 13.

3036
03:18:41,754 --> 03:18:45,325
LIAM: They do make it.

3037
03:18:45,325 --> 03:18:57,132
MATT: Okay. So that would be ten points of thunder
damage, or half on a successful save, so they're

3038
03:18:57,132 --> 03:19:00,768
not pushed, but they take five points of thunder
damage each.

3039
03:19:00,768 --> 03:19:09,897
LIAM: Okay. This thing-- just out of the pureness
of Matthew Mercer's heart and soul, which we all

3040
03:19:09,897 --> 03:19:19,519
see, let's be honest, in a moment of crisis, your
heart and care for your friends bursts out of the

3041
03:19:19,519 --> 03:19:25,961
microphone system, we hear it everywhere,
distorted, but certainly a blast of fucking force

3042
03:19:25,961 --> 03:19:32,288
out of your fucking chest, Matt, goes (explosion)
and this thing just goes (explosion) and pieces go

3043
03:19:32,288 --> 03:19:33,823
(clattering) and fall down.

3044
03:19:33,823 --> 03:19:35,332
(cheering)

3045
03:19:35,332 --> 03:19:42,243
LIAM: This thing, you smashed-- three iMac screens
get smashed and cracked and break away, and this

3046
03:19:42,243 --> 03:19:45,110
thing looks very haggard, but it is still there.

3047
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:51,832
MATT: I'll use my last five feet of movement to
try and then move alongside of the crack away from

3048
03:19:51,832 --> 03:19:54,161
the currently still standing there creature.

3049
03:19:54,161 --> 03:19:55,092
LIAM: This way?

3050
03:19:55,092 --> 03:20:02,392
MATT: Yeah, that is a crack, so I'd say just one
away from the crack.

3051
03:20:02,392 --> 03:20:07,596
LIAM: You step backward and this is not too deep,
but you are now standing in-- you're not caught or

3052
03:20:07,596 --> 03:20:11,845
anything, but you're now standing in the really
slippery shit. It's also really adorable to see

3053
03:20:11,845 --> 03:20:19,859
you two hugging at the table right now. And
Marisha-- oh, you know what? I missed Neil before

3054
03:20:19,859 --> 03:20:28,066
because I'm just-- he's a d6 in my list, so I'm
gonna let Neil jump up and attack this thing.

3055
03:20:28,066 --> 03:20:29,878
ASHLEY: C'mon, Neil!

3056
03:20:29,878 --> 03:20:31,900
MATT: You got this.

3057
03:20:31,900 --> 03:20:33,067
LIAM: Yeah.

3058
03:20:33,067 --> 03:20:36,963
TRAVIS: (sings) He whipped his hair back and
forth, he whipped his hair back and forth.

3059
03:20:36,963 --> 03:20:53,950
LIAM: Okay, so that is-- okay. He grabs a hold of
it and rips a screen off. (yells) (whirring

3060
03:20:53,950 --> 03:21:01,640
sounds) "Fuck. Laura?" And it is Marisha's turn.

3061
03:21:01,640 --> 03:21:04,662
MARISHA: Wait, was that (whirring sounds) Neil?

3062
03:21:04,662 --> 03:21:09,403
LIAM: No, it turned to Neil. What was left 
of it turned toward Neil.

3063
03:21:09,456 --> 03:21:16,730
MARISHA: Okay. And there's still that thing that's
digging in the corner. Can I get to it?

3064
03:21:16,730 --> 03:21:17,918
Where am I?

3065
03:21:17,918 --> 03:21:21,922
LIAM: You're here. You can, you'd run out of juice
by the time you got there. You'd have to dash to

3066
03:21:21,922 --> 03:21:26,591
get there. You can get to that one.

3067
03:21:26,591 --> 03:21:29,866
MATT: Your movement's 30?

3068
03:21:29,866 --> 03:21:31,913
MARISHA: Wait, what's that thing?

3069
03:21:31,913 --> 03:21:35,262
LIAM: This? Matt just fucked it up with a
Thunderwave.

3070
03:21:35,262 --> 03:21:37,037
MARISHA: Okay, I get to that.

3071
03:21:37,037 --> 03:21:39,495
LIAM: All right, you're right up on it.

3072
03:21:39,495 --> 03:21:53,831
MARISHA: And can I take it by the back of its neck
and push it and be like, scream real loud! We need

3073
03:21:53,831 --> 03:21:57,599
the feedback! (yells)

3074
03:21:57,599 --> 03:22:00,767
LIAM: And do anything or yell at it?

3075
03:22:00,767 --> 03:22:03,175
MARISHA: And grab it by the back of its neck.

3076
03:22:03,175 --> 03:22:08,692
LIAM: You mean, the brace holding the iMac's
screen up? Okay.

3077
03:22:08,692 --> 03:22:12,316
MARISHA: And I go, scream! Scream for me!

3078
03:22:12,316 --> 03:22:14,343
LIAM: Okay. And that's it?

3079
03:22:14,343 --> 03:22:15,434
MARISHA: Yeah.

3080
03:22:15,434 --> 03:22:17,079
TRAVIS: It's like Phantom of the Opera.

3081
03:22:17,079 --> 03:22:19,501
MARISHA: Sing! Sing!

3082
03:22:19,501 --> 03:22:22,694
LIAM: Make an intimidation check?

3083
03:22:22,694 --> 03:22:30,110
MARISHA: Sure. Oh, that's not good. Seven.

3084
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:36,795
LIAM: There's a crackle of light, and then it
makes that sound when Macs reboot and goes

3085
03:22:36,795 --> 03:22:38,398
(bwomp).

3086
03:22:38,398 --> 03:22:40,696
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn it, Macs.

3087
03:22:40,696 --> 03:22:49,460
LIAM: That's about it. Laura tries to punch the--
sorry, Laura's not feeling too well. Laura attacks

3088
03:22:49,460 --> 03:22:57,048
this thing, going, "Neil, come on! Together! Oh my
goodness!" And she tries to punch at it. She hits

3089
03:22:57,048 --> 03:23:02,939
it right in the one solid piece left on this thing
and kinda hits her hand really hard. She stays

3090
03:23:02,939 --> 03:23:06,735
there, though. She's afraid to leave Neil.

3091
03:23:06,735 --> 03:23:08,933
ASHLEY: 'Cause she's a good friend.

3092
03:23:08,933 --> 03:23:11,151
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sam, your turn.

3093
03:23:11,151 --> 03:23:14,381
SAM: I'm gonna run as fast as I can up to the big
guy.

3094
03:23:14,381 --> 03:23:15,782
LIAM: Yes. This one?

3095
03:23:15,782 --> 03:23:16,845
SAM: Yeah.

3096
03:23:16,845 --> 03:23:19,079
LIAM: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3097
03:23:19,079 --> 03:23:20,404
SAM: Even closer--

3098
03:23:20,404 --> 03:23:21,536
LIAM: You're gonna run out of--

3099
03:23:21,536 --> 03:23:23,082
SAM: That's okay. I just want to talk to it.

3100
03:23:23,082 --> 03:23:24,112
LIAM: Okay, go.

3101
03:23:24,112 --> 03:23:31,082
SAM: And I just want to say to it, Liam! If you
can hear me in there, hey buddy. Let's knock this

3102
03:23:31,082 --> 03:23:38,394
off and just record our podcast, okay? We haven't
done an episode in like three months. We should

3103
03:23:38,394 --> 03:23:43,676
just do one of those instead! We got recording
equipment right here, huh? What do you say, pal?

3104
03:23:43,676 --> 03:23:47,082
LIAM: Eight feet above you is that little
camcorder screen, and you're eyeing it, you've

3105
03:23:47,082 --> 03:23:49,907
learned by now, and it just says 'FIND ME'.

3106
03:23:49,907 --> 03:23:54,083
SAM: 'FIND ME'. That means find Liam. We have to
find Liam.

3107
03:23:54,083 --> 03:23:55,763
MARISHA: Okay.

3108
03:23:55,763 --> 03:23:57,840
MATT: Didn't Liam just get--

3109
03:23:57,840 --> 03:24:00,691
SAM: We just heard a scream, we didn't see him
die.

3110
03:24:00,691 --> 03:24:02,462
LIAM: Taliesin.

3111
03:24:02,462 --> 03:24:09,253
TALIESIN: There is so much that is unpleasant
happening in here. I'm gonna free up some people.

3112
03:24:09,253 --> 03:24:14,807
There's just too much happening. The one that
Laura's-- yeah, I'm right there.

3113
03:24:14,807 --> 03:24:16,547
LIAM: He's right on your butt.

3114
03:24:16,547 --> 03:24:18,166
TALIESIN: (sighs)

3115
03:24:18,166 --> 03:24:22,885
LIAM: And he's just come from mangling sweet Liam
O'Brien.

3116
03:24:22,885 --> 03:24:29,559
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Travis is gonna keep him
busy for a second. I'm gonna deal with the one

3117
03:24:29,559 --> 03:24:34,113
that Laura is-- I'm gonna keep rolling around,
just trying to-- I'm gonna run away from that one

3118
03:24:34,113 --> 03:24:37,455
and try and stab the one up by-- yeah, that one
over there.

3119
03:24:37,455 --> 03:24:39,723
TRAVIS: I'm going to Crafty. Nature Valley granola
bars.

3120
03:24:39,723 --> 03:24:43,158
LIAM: So you're going after this one? You're
attacking from where you are, or you're moving?

3121
03:24:43,158 --> 03:24:48,021
TALIESIN: Both. I'm not getting within-- I'm
getting further from that-- oh, am I up face-up to

3122
03:24:48,021 --> 03:24:50,278
that one? Oh, I didn't know I was face-up to that
one.

3123
03:24:50,278 --> 03:24:51,424
LIAM: Okay, understood.

3124
03:24:51,424 --> 03:24:58,032
TALIESIN: I thought I was the guy below. Yeah. I'm
gonna shove tentacles in it and hopefully start to

3125
03:24:58,032 --> 03:24:59,000
wrangle it apart.

3126
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,681
LIAM: Okay. Ranged attack.

3127
03:25:01,681 --> 03:25:03,610
TRAVIS: Grab the last one of them fruit snacks.

3128
03:25:03,610 --> 03:25:05,457
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not good. Nine.

3129
03:25:05,457 --> 03:25:11,919
LIAM: Yeah, no. It actually, the tentacles fizzle.
They're not there. You see a brief glow and it

3130
03:25:11,919 --> 03:25:15,196
goes (gurgling) and they sort of curl and shrivel
in on themselves.

3131
03:25:15,196 --> 03:25:19,517
TALIESIN: Travis! Help!

3132
03:25:19,517 --> 03:25:22,635
LIAM: Travis, what do you wanna do?

3133
03:25:22,635 --> 03:25:25,375
TRAVIS: I'm double-dashing for Crafty.

3134
03:25:25,375 --> 03:25:28,612
TALIESIN: No! I'll remember this!

3135
03:25:28,612 --> 03:25:31,081
LIAM: Your wife is right here.

3136
03:25:31,081 --> 03:25:33,857
TRAVIS: Nope. This is all a bad dream.

3137
03:25:33,857 --> 03:25:34,982
LIAM: Are you going?

3138
03:25:34,982 --> 03:25:36,121
TRAVIS: I'm going.

3139
03:25:36,121 --> 03:25:39,933
LIAM: Wow. Travis ran into the pale green light
spilling out of a hole in the wall.

3140
03:25:39,933 --> 03:25:44,054
TRAVIS: It's green! This is going terrible.

3141
03:25:44,054 --> 03:25:45,695
ASHLEY: Travis!

3142
03:25:45,695 --> 03:25:48,727
MARISHA: There are wasabi peas there, go, go, go!

3143
03:25:48,727 --> 03:25:51,802
TRAVIS: There's a kale smoothie.

3144
03:25:51,802 --> 03:25:54,080
ASHLEY: I can't believe you.

3145
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:58,687
MATT: That's what it was. When you said, "Travis!
Help!" you were straight-up Neo. "Trinity! Help!"

3146
03:25:58,687 --> 03:26:05,431
LIAM: Sam, this thing leans in on you, and as it
comes down closer to you, you see, 'SAD'. Gone.

3147
03:26:05,431 --> 03:26:10,314
And it stabs one of its remaining three legs, just
sort of jukes up on its side 'cause it has three

3148
03:26:10,314 --> 03:26:15,254
legs, so suddenly it has two legs, it's rickety,
it tries to stab downward at you, but because it's

3149
03:26:15,254 --> 03:26:20,883
now teetering on two legs, (Dr. Moreau voice) 'to
walk on two legs is hard, maybe four is better'.

3150
03:26:20,883 --> 03:26:23,074
(laughter)

3151
03:26:23,074 --> 03:26:33,754
LIAM: Its aim is bad, and it stabs into the
ground. This thing swivels-- this thing is

3152
03:26:33,754 --> 03:26:39,243
short-circuiting and bristling, sparks are flying
off of it, but it rears up like a horse almost,

3153
03:26:39,243 --> 03:26:47,661
and the legs come down, and you guys watch as two
sharpened tripod legs go through Neil Druckmann's

3154
03:26:47,661 --> 03:26:53,617
guts on the ground, and Neil gets pushed to the
ground and starts screaming, and he goes

3155
03:26:53,617 --> 03:27:01,006
(screams), and he reaches up and grabs hold of the
cables on it, and as blood is going (spraying

3156
03:27:01,006 --> 03:27:11,207
sound), he rips as hard as he can, and cables
break free, and the machine just falls, broken, on

3157
03:27:11,207 --> 03:27:15,431
top of Neil, and nothing moves there, neither
move.

3158
03:27:15,431 --> 03:27:19,535
MARISHA: But did he sign his NDA? Oh no.

3159
03:27:19,592 --> 03:27:22,086
SAM: He had so many more games to make.

3160
03:27:22,086 --> 03:27:24,092
MATT: The great NDA in the sky.

3161
03:27:24,092 --> 03:27:26,500
TALIESIN: He'll never break NDA again.

3162
03:27:26,500 --> 03:27:35,312
LIAM: This thing takes two iMac-- it's got iMac
palms, and it just goes (creaking sound) and does

3163
03:27:35,312 --> 03:27:40,808
smack you in your head, but oddly, it doesn't
really hurt. I mean, it hurts, but you've had

3164
03:27:40,808 --> 03:27:53,269
worse knocks. This brand-new baby robot is not so
experienced. And this guy gets up on its little

3165
03:27:53,269 --> 03:27:58,981
pin-pokey legs and tries to scuttle around and
deal with you, and actually, its back leg snaps,

3166
03:27:58,981 --> 03:28:05,466
and it tries to stab out at you, but because these
things are made out of tinkertoys, almost, it

3167
03:28:05,466 --> 03:28:12,183
feels like, it loses its balance and the arm goes
wide, and you feel it go (fwwp), and bad girl, you

3168
03:28:12,183 --> 03:28:17,333
have trained in martial arts, you went-- you pull
to the side just in time, and you feel it catch a

3169
03:28:17,333 --> 03:28:21,702
little bit of your hair. You have a flashback of
your hair being matted on a beach, and that's

3170
03:28:21,752 --> 03:28:24,447
gone. And it is Ashley's turn.

3171
03:28:24,447 --> 03:28:32,999
ASHLEY: Okay. Talk to the big guy again and say,
where do we find you?

3172
03:28:32,999 --> 03:28:37,125
LIAM: Is that all you want to do?

3173
03:28:37,125 --> 03:28:39,403
ASHLEY: No.

3174
03:28:39,403 --> 03:28:41,401
(laughter)

3175
03:28:41,401 --> 03:28:43,117
SAM: Not anymore.

3176
03:28:43,117 --> 03:28:53,649
ASHLEY: I just-- depending on what he says
determines what I'm going to do. Can I do that?

3177
03:28:53,649 --> 03:29:02,283
LIAM: Okay. Five of six seconds go by, and the
screens flash nothing. And in a split-second, you

3178
03:29:02,283 --> 03:29:05,041
decide to...

3179
03:29:05,041 --> 03:29:15,292
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to-- (sighs) Shit. I'm
gonna start running towards

3180
03:29:15,292 --> 03:29:18,005
the fucking green Crafty.

3181
03:29:18,005 --> 03:29:19,614
SAM: No!

3182
03:29:19,614 --> 03:29:21,875
TALIESIN: It's time for Crafty!

3183
03:29:21,875 --> 03:29:24,333
MATT: The draw's too strong for the Crafty room.

3184
03:29:24,333 --> 03:29:26,069
ASHLEY: 'Cause I don't think he's in that thing.

3185
03:29:26,069 --> 03:29:28,386
TRAVIS: There's egg rolls out here!

3186
03:29:28,386 --> 03:29:31,000
MATT: I hope it's like a Resident Evil movie-style
just laser hallway,

3187
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:32,696
and you just walk through and--

3188
03:29:32,696 --> 03:29:34,298
TRAVIS: I'm in the cubes.

3189
03:29:34,298 --> 03:29:38,436
MATT: Yep. None of us know, we all just one by one
plow through.

3190
03:29:38,436 --> 03:29:46,443
LIAM: As you're running, you hear (whirring
sounds) and you feel the back of your leg, rake

3191
03:29:46,443 --> 03:29:52,251
something down the back leg of your mocap suit,
and the whole back leg rips and tears, but you

3192
03:29:52,251 --> 03:29:57,353
keep running. Five, ten, 15, 20--

3193
03:29:57,353 --> 03:29:59,666
ASHLEY: I want to go around that thing.

3194
03:29:59,666 --> 03:30:00,664
LIAM: This way?

3195
03:30:00,664 --> 03:30:01,761
ASHLEY: No, the other side.

3196
03:30:01,761 --> 03:30:02,583
LIAM: This way.

3197
03:30:02,583 --> 03:30:04,657
ASHLEY: The other side of the chasm.

3198
03:30:04,657 --> 03:30:06,905
LIAM: That's where you are. Matt?

3199
03:30:06,905 --> 03:30:09,569
MATT: How much damage did she take? Did she take
any damage, or is she good?

3200
03:30:09,634 --> 03:30:10,720
LIAM: She got missed.

3201
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:14,023
MATT: Good. Awesome. All right, seeing all this
going down--

3202
03:30:14,023 --> 03:30:17,096
TRAVIS: Join me in Crafty.

3203
03:30:17,096 --> 03:30:22,551
MARISHA: If we don't get a Welch's sponsorship
after this, I'm going to pursue that shit. Yo,

3204
03:30:22,551 --> 03:30:26,441
Welch's. Keep going.

3205
03:30:26,441 --> 03:30:33,149
MATT: I'm going to-- she's got that one. I'm going
to make 30 feet towards Taliesin while shouting

3206
03:30:33,149 --> 03:30:36,508
out, Liam, are you okay?

3207
03:30:36,508 --> 03:30:38,830
LIAM: You don't hear anything.

3208
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:45,267
MATT: I'm going to, as I look over at Taliesin
facing off with the creature, I'm like, you're

3209
03:30:45,267 --> 03:30:48,493
adorable, and you've got this. You've adorably got
this!

3210
03:30:48,493 --> 03:30:49,639
SAM: Inspiration.

3211
03:30:49,639 --> 03:30:51,622
MATT: I'm giving you an insipiration die. A d6.

3212
03:30:51,622 --> 03:30:53,786
SAM: You are adorable. Well, you were.

3213
03:30:53,786 --> 03:30:56,819
MATT: And I'm going to dash up towards the ramp in
the back corner,

3214
03:30:56,819 --> 03:30:58,592
just to see what remains of Liam.

3215
03:30:58,592 --> 03:31:01,952
LIAM: And Taliesin's cheeks turn even rosier as
you run off.

3216
03:31:01,952 --> 03:31:05,294
TALIESIN: I was so marketable.

3217
03:31:05,294 --> 03:31:11,885
LIAM: You get up here. It's not good.

3218
03:31:11,885 --> 03:31:22,185
MATT: Okay. Like he has a few minutes left to
live, or no, it's fucking Chef Boyardee. Okay.

3219
03:31:22,185 --> 03:31:23,391
SAM: Who, Liam?

3220
03:31:23,391 --> 03:31:24,321
MATT: Yeah.

3221
03:31:24,321 --> 03:31:25,819
TRAVIS: Well, let's be descriptive, shall we?

3222
03:31:25,819 --> 03:31:27,331
LIAM: You don't even see a face anymore.

3223
03:31:27,331 --> 03:31:30,352
MATT: Okay. All right. Well, that's definitely the
end of my turn.

3224
03:31:30,352 --> 03:31:33,013
LIAM: Marisha?

3225
03:31:33,013 --> 03:31:37,481
MARISHA: Okay, I have this guy? It's just me and
him?

3226
03:31:37,481 --> 03:31:38,497
LIAM: Yes.

3227
03:31:38,497 --> 03:31:44,464
MARISHA: Okay. And he's a robot, too?

3228
03:31:44,464 --> 03:31:53,589
LIAM: It's a robot. It's moving camera equipment
and highly expensive performance-capture

3229
03:31:53,589 --> 03:31:56,312
equipment, repurposed.

3230
03:31:56,419 --> 03:32:06,587
MARISHA: Highly expensive camera equipment,
repurposed. Okay. Can I sweep his leg and go into

3231
03:32:06,587 --> 03:32:17,194
a combat triangle and take him down, and then be
like, where's your failsafe?

3232
03:32:17,194 --> 03:32:20,944
LIAM: Of course you can. This is D&amp;D. Roll to
attack.

3233
03:32:20,944 --> 03:32:23,262
TRAVIS: Of course you can do all of that. Go
offline.

3234
03:32:23,262 --> 03:32:25,923
LIAM: Roll to attack.

3235
03:32:25,923 --> 03:32:27,317
MARISHA: Okay.

3236
03:32:27,317 --> 03:32:30,494
LIAM: Let's deal with the sweep-the-leg part
first.

3237
03:32:30,494 --> 03:32:35,889
MARISHA: Sweep the leg. Don't fuck me, Gil! That's
a natural one, Gil.

3238
03:32:35,889 --> 03:32:37,252
SAM: Oh god.

3239
03:32:37,252 --> 03:32:46,710
LIAM: Your foot traces an arc and goes (impact
noise) and stops and does not move past its leg.

3240
03:32:46,767 --> 03:32:52,939
MARISHA: Can I go: There's a firewall! There's a
fucking firewall!

3241
03:32:52,939 --> 03:32:56,695
LIAM: Do you want to use your second monk attack?

3242
03:32:56,695 --> 03:32:58,280
MARISHA: Do I have another one?

3243
03:32:58,280 --> 03:33:02,995
LIAM: Yeah. Bonus, yeah. Action and bonus. You're
right there. Roll again. You just completed a

3244
03:33:02,995 --> 03:33:04,957
kick. Maybe you can punch it in the goolies.

3245
03:33:04,957 --> 03:33:13,537
MARISHA: I'm going to punch and see if I can grab
its cords and rip it out.

3246
03:33:13,601 --> 03:33:15,792
LIAM: All right. Split-second later, roll to
attack.

3247
03:33:15,792 --> 03:33:21,808
MARISHA: That's cocked. 18.

3248
03:33:21,808 --> 03:33:25,972
LIAM: Yeah, your foot goes (impact noise), gets
stopped. (grunts) In a very Marisha fashion,

3249
03:33:25,972 --> 03:33:31,245
(impact noise, mechanical noises).

3250
03:33:31,245 --> 03:33:32,538
MARISHA: Yes.

3251
03:33:32,538 --> 03:33:34,053
MATT: All righty.

3252
03:33:34,053 --> 03:33:36,014
TALIESIN: Two down.

3253
03:33:36,068 --> 03:33:38,943
MARISHA: (uncertain noises)

3254
03:33:38,943 --> 03:33:52,202
LIAM: It's Laura's turn. Laura collapses by Neil
and starts pushing this thing off Neil and starts

3255
03:33:52,202 --> 03:33:57,957
saying, "Neil! Neil!" and she starts shaking at
him and crying over his body. There's blood in his

3256
03:33:57,957 --> 03:34:04,261
beard and it's really sad. You guys almost don't
have the heart to go on, but you'd better. Sam,

3257
03:34:04,261 --> 03:34:05,968
what do you want to do?

3258
03:34:05,968 --> 03:34:14,815
SAM: He said "find me" but he's dead. I guess I
didn't see what you saw.

3259
03:34:14,815 --> 03:34:16,298
TRAVIS: (whispering) He's at Crafty.

3260
03:34:16,298 --> 03:34:18,444
LIAM: Find me at Crafty.

3261
03:34:18,499 --> 03:34:25,140
SAM: I'm going to kick the robot in the robot
nuts.

3262
03:34:25,140 --> 03:34:29,297
LIAM: Do it. Right in the SD card belly-button
that Marisha's doing?

3263
03:34:29,297 --> 03:34:30,710
SAM: Yeah. 19.

3264
03:34:30,710 --> 03:34:33,573
LIAM: Hit it.

3265
03:34:33,573 --> 03:34:35,249
SAM: With what?

3266
03:34:35,249 --> 03:34:36,766
LIAM: Your fist, at this point.

3267
03:34:36,766 --> 03:34:38,801
SAM: What am I rolling, a d4?

3268
03:34:38,801 --> 03:34:40,728
LIAM: No. What's your strength modifier?

3269
03:34:40,728 --> 03:34:42,312
SAM: One.

3270
03:34:42,312 --> 03:34:47,728
LIAM: One? It takes two hit points of damage. You
punch it right in its belly-button and you watch

3271
03:34:47,728 --> 03:34:53,466
as this thing that Marisha pointed out when she
was down under there, you watch this cylinder go

3272
03:34:53,466 --> 03:34:58,428
(crunch) and get knocked out of place, and the
thing goes (mechanical winding-down noise,

3273
03:34:58,428 --> 03:35:06,785
ratcheting). It keeps going, but you saw shit
happen when you just hit that thing.

3274
03:35:06,785 --> 03:35:15,279
SAM: Okay. For my bonus action, I will say, please
hit it in its glowing naughty bits, please. Oh,

3275
03:35:15,279 --> 03:35:17,690
wait. Everyone's gone to Crafty.

3276
03:35:17,690 --> 03:35:19,347
MATT: Bye, everyone!

3277
03:35:19,347 --> 03:35:20,783
LIAM: Taliesin's up.

3278
03:35:20,783 --> 03:35:26,211
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're too close to clearing this.
I'm going to try and circle around this thing and

3279
03:35:26,211 --> 03:35:27,596
get a better shot at it.

3280
03:35:27,596 --> 03:35:28,772
LIAM: At this guy?

3281
03:35:28,772 --> 03:35:30,035
TALIESIN: The one that's got me stuck here.

3282
03:35:30,035 --> 03:35:31,167
LIAM: Yeah, go for it. Do you want to move?

3283
03:35:31,167 --> 03:35:32,763
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to circle around him.

3284
03:35:32,763 --> 03:35:37,364
LIAM: Okay. Are you going to give it the tentacle
concho?

3285
03:35:37,364 --> 03:35:39,986
TALIESIN: I am going to tentacle kancho.

3286
03:35:40,039 --> 03:35:40,949
LIAM: Kancho.

3287
03:35:40,949 --> 03:35:42,283
TALIESIN: Kancho.

3288
03:35:42,283 --> 03:35:43,508
MATT: Wow.

3289
03:35:43,508 --> 03:35:50,441
TALIESIN: Yeah, we are kancho-ing here. Big purple
concho. I'm going to add. 11!

3290
03:35:50,441 --> 03:35:53,595
SAM: Just awful.

3291
03:35:53,595 --> 03:36:01,326
LIAM: You've been abandoned by whatever dark force
you wooed into bed, Taliesin. You are not turning

3292
03:36:01,326 --> 03:36:03,278
it on right now.

3293
03:36:03,278 --> 03:36:05,647
TALIESIN: It's because Matt's sitting in my
chair.

3294
03:36:05,647 --> 03:36:09,693
MATT: Ha! I've absorbed his power for the evening.
(cackles)

3295
03:36:09,693 --> 03:36:12,059
LIAM: Travis.

3296
03:36:12,059 --> 03:36:13,023
TRAVIS: Yeah?

3297
03:36:13,023 --> 03:36:25,065
LIAM: You burst into this tunnel. In a split
second, everything turns dark and green at the

3298
03:36:25,065 --> 03:36:32,009
same time. You're seeing a tube, a tunnel go
(whoop) and just up. It curves up pretty steeply.

3299
03:36:32,009 --> 03:36:38,894
You could do it. You're running towards it, and
again, the same kinds of tubing and what look like

3300
03:36:38,894 --> 03:36:46,182
veins or innards, except mechanical at the same
time, are spiraling up the length of this tube and

3301
03:36:46,182 --> 03:36:50,733
then out of sight. You can definitely go up it,
but it's not this, it's this.

3302
03:36:50,733 --> 03:36:52,757
TRAVIS: Just to be clear, no tables or cans of
Sterno?

3303
03:36:52,757 --> 03:36:55,569
LIAM: There's nothing but a tube.

3304
03:36:55,569 --> 03:36:57,401
TRAVIS: I'm bolting up that tunnel.

3305
03:36:57,401 --> 03:37:06,553
LIAM: Yeah, you are. Okay. It does not change. You
run a full 60 feet, and you're just booking it in

3306
03:37:06,553 --> 03:37:13,484
your little short-shorts and polo shirt and going
(pants) and that's where we'll leave you.

3307
03:37:13,484 --> 03:37:17,730
MATT: You've got this, Travis!

3308
03:37:17,730 --> 03:37:22,052
TRAVIS: Saving the day. (sings) Saving the day!

3309
03:37:22,052 --> 03:37:32,025
LIAM: This guy tries to basically sit on you, but
it is breaking down. It is still moving, and in

3310
03:37:32,082 --> 03:37:42,044
fact, it's pushing on you. The screen goes, 'SAM'.
Gone. I'm going to say that it backs you up five

3311
03:37:42,098 --> 03:37:53,189
feet, going (mechanical noises). Nope. This thing,
I'm going to say that you've moved with it,

3312
03:37:53,189 --> 03:37:59,990
Taliesin, just for funsies. It's slow-moving, and
you continue to move around. You're ashamed, but

3313
03:37:59,990 --> 03:38:06,067
still awake and alert. Ash.

3314
03:38:06,067 --> 03:38:18,013
ASHLEY: Are they connected to the computers that
are already in the muck? All of the ones that are

3315
03:38:18,013 --> 03:38:20,467
in the pod area?

3316
03:38:20,467 --> 03:38:24,719
LIAM: Those are there for reference. Those are
piles of shit. Those are here.

3317
03:38:24,719 --> 03:38:27,771
What was here is here.

3318
03:38:27,771 --> 03:38:35,934
ASHLEY: I don't want to abandon this. Can I get to
Taliesin in this turn, or no?

3319
03:38:35,934 --> 03:38:43,104
LIAM: You can get to him, but you can't do
anything, or you can get here.

3320
03:38:43,104 --> 03:38:45,112
ASHLEY: Okay, but I can get back to the big guy.

3321
03:38:45,112 --> 03:38:46,526
LIAM: You can get back to the big guy.

3322
03:38:46,526 --> 03:38:49,807
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to go back to the big
guy.

3323
03:38:49,807 --> 03:38:56,975
LIAM: You're right there with your buddy Sam. What
would you like to do?

3324
03:38:56,975 --> 03:39:03,698
ASHLEY: I'm going to kick that SD card, the
glowing thing at the bottom, again.

3325
03:39:03,698 --> 03:39:04,811
LIAM: Okay, go for it.

3326
03:39:04,811 --> 03:39:06,039
ASHLEY: Okay.

3327
03:39:06,039 --> 03:39:07,987
TRAVIS: Come on!

3328
03:39:07,987 --> 03:39:14,671
SAM: Don't you still have an inspiration?

3329
03:39:14,671 --> 03:39:16,461
ASHLEY: I do?

3330
03:39:16,461 --> 03:39:18,811
SAM: I don't know. Did Matt inspire you or
Taliesin?

3331
03:39:18,811 --> 03:39:22,197
MATT: Taliesin, earlier. She used hers in the last
battle.

3332
03:39:22,197 --> 03:39:24,073
ASHLEY: 11?

3333
03:39:24,073 --> 03:39:28,078
TRAVIS: Wow. We can't hit shit!

3334
03:39:28,078 --> 03:39:35,491
LIAM: It is tougher than the other ones and
slow-moving. Your knuckles are banged up real bad.

3335
03:39:35,491 --> 03:39:40,916
You've cut the skin on your knuckles, and it is
still just leaning on Riegel.

3336
03:39:40,916 --> 03:39:43,518
ASHLEY: Where do we find you? Answer me!

3337
03:39:43,518 --> 03:39:45,959
LIAM: Matt, what would you like to do?

3338
03:39:45,959 --> 03:39:51,183
MATT: Seeing Liam shredded, seeing them fumble
with this thing, I take a full movement in the

3339
03:39:51,183 --> 03:40:07,976
direction of the larger creature, there. Yeah, and
I go, hey! Computer! Stop all the downloading!

3340
03:40:07,976 --> 03:40:17,429
You've been vague and not helpful to any of us.
That makes you a bad computer. That's my Vicious

3341
03:40:17,429 --> 03:40:18,761
Mockery.

3342
03:40:18,761 --> 03:40:23,395
LIAM: So in the midst of this horror, you're
worried that you're going to die, but your gallows

3343
03:40:23,395 --> 03:40:28,508
humor kicks in and fuck it. Fuck this thing. And
you lash out at it.

3344
03:40:28,508 --> 03:40:33,102
MATT: Yeah, I'm angry! It's been completely
unhelpful, even if it is Liam. You've got LCD

3345
03:40:33,102 --> 03:40:37,129
screens at your disposal and you're giving us
vague hints? No. Fuck that noise.

3346
03:40:37,129 --> 03:40:38,212
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3347
03:40:38,212 --> 03:40:44,697
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

3348
03:40:44,697 --> 03:40:49,772
LIAM: What's the save?

3349
03:40:49,772 --> 03:40:51,153
MATT: 13.

3350
03:40:51,153 --> 03:40:53,678
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

3351
03:40:53,678 --> 03:40:56,200
MATT: I cannot do anything.

3352
03:40:56,200 --> 03:40:58,213
TRAVIS: We can't do anything.

3353
03:40:58,213 --> 03:40:59,716
TALIESIN: Just like real life.

3354
03:40:59,716 --> 03:41:13,333
MATT: There's nothing? It does nothing to it. I
see no reaction. My gusto fails, and I go: help,

3355
03:41:13,333 --> 03:41:14,531
computer.

3356
03:41:14,531 --> 03:41:16,189
(laughter)

3357
03:41:16,189 --> 03:41:17,224
MATT: That's my turn.

3358
03:41:17,224 --> 03:41:18,389
LIAM: Okay. Marisha.

3359
03:41:18,389 --> 03:41:19,786
MARISHA: Okay, where are you?

3360
03:41:19,786 --> 03:41:23,616
MATT: Actually, no. At the end of my turn, I turn
back to Taliesin and go: yeah, but seriously, do

3361
03:41:23,616 --> 03:41:31,543
something! Come on! You worked with Spielberg,
asshole! I give you my last inspiration die.

3362
03:41:31,543 --> 03:41:33,875
SAM: You worked with Spielberg?!

3363
03:41:33,875 --> 03:41:34,805
TALIESIN: I did.

3364
03:41:34,805 --> 03:41:35,762
SAM: Wow.

3365
03:41:35,762 --> 03:41:36,995
MARISHA: I'm there?

3366
03:41:36,995 --> 03:41:38,204
LIAM: Yeah, you are.

3367
03:41:38,204 --> 03:41:42,256
MARISHA: There's a crack in the hole? In the
ground?

3368
03:41:42,256 --> 03:41:44,319
LIAM: Right there? Yeah.

3369
03:41:44,319 --> 03:41:45,376
MATT: The crack in the hole?

3370
03:41:45,376 --> 03:41:46,523
LIAM: The crack in the hole. There's a hole in the
crack.

3371
03:41:46,523 --> 03:41:53,959
MARISHA: There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza,
dear Liza. Okay, there's an evil bad guy and then

3372
03:41:53,959 --> 03:41:55,215
a crack in the ground.

3373
03:41:55,215 --> 03:41:57,492
LIAM: This thing is looking rough.

3374
03:41:57,492 --> 03:41:59,596
MARISHA: It's looking rough?

3375
03:41:59,596 --> 03:42:00,808
LIAM: Yeah, man.

3376
03:42:00,808 --> 03:42:05,767
MARISHA: Can I get there in time?

3377
03:42:05,767 --> 03:42:08,241
LIAM: To this? Yeah, you can.

3378
03:42:08,241 --> 03:42:17,647
MARISHA: Yeah? Okay. I'm going to say, none of
this is being saved on the internet, guys! It's

3379
03:42:17,647 --> 03:42:20,530
fine! And I do a double punch.

3380
03:42:20,530 --> 03:42:22,198
LIAM: Yeah, go for it. Roll twice.

3381
03:42:22,198 --> 03:42:25,671
MARISHA: Okay.

3382
03:42:25,671 --> 03:42:29,311
MATT: Demogorgon left an impact on her, man.

3383
03:42:29,311 --> 03:42:33,593
MARISHA: 16. And then the second one--

3384
03:42:33,593 --> 03:42:35,757
TRAVIS: Should have backed up!

3385
03:42:35,757 --> 03:42:39,382
MARISHA: Good. 17. 16 and 17.

3386
03:42:39,382 --> 03:42:41,470
LIAM: Roll for damage on both.

3387
03:42:41,470 --> 03:42:50,616
MARISHA: And that's 1d4 plus three? Three plus
three is six, and then one plus three is four. Six

3388
03:42:50,616 --> 03:42:52,042
and four, ten.

3389
03:42:52,042 --> 03:42:58,132
LIAM: You come through and one hand slams into its
third leg and breaks right through and it falls

3390
03:42:58,132 --> 03:43:04,456
forward, no longer having a third leg to stand on,
and its little belly button is right there, and

3391
03:43:04,456 --> 03:43:10,879
you go (grunts) and punch. That cylinder goes,
(metallic thudding) and rolls off into the

3392
03:43:10,879 --> 03:43:12,209
corner.

3393
03:43:12,209 --> 03:43:14,803
MARISHA: (grunts) Fuck you, cloud storage!

3394
03:43:14,803 --> 03:43:20,594
SAM: You are on a rampage about backing up data.

3395
03:43:20,594 --> 03:43:24,666
MARISHA: Fuck you, backup data. You're easily
hackable. It's not fair!

3396
03:43:24,666 --> 03:43:29,168
MATT: I feel like if we would have had a good
sponsor tonight, it would have been Backblaze, a

3397
03:43:29,168 --> 03:43:31,455
fantastic service for backing up your
information.

3398
03:43:31,455 --> 03:43:34,516
MARISHA: If only Backblaze was sponsoring us.

3399
03:43:34,516 --> 03:43:46,978
LIAM: Laura drags Neil's body away from the gap
and lays him out. Sam, it's your turn.

3400
03:43:46,978 --> 03:43:51,443
SAM: I'm gonna use my-- Because the robot is dead.

3401
03:43:51,443 --> 03:43:53,089
LIAM: The big one, yeah.

3402
03:43:53,089 --> 03:43:59,405
SAM: As far as I know, Liam is dead. I'm going to
use my ranger senses--

3403
03:43:59,405 --> 03:44:04,330
LIAM: Technically, there is voiceover recording
done on these sets, so you are in your favored

3404
03:44:04,401 --> 03:44:05,331
territory.

3405
03:44:05,331 --> 03:44:07,494
TALIESIN: I knew it! I knew it.

3406
03:44:07,494 --> 03:44:18,741
SAM: I'm going to look and see if I see anything
out of the ordinary. Any sign of a hidden door or

3407
03:44:18,741 --> 03:44:22,300
a chamber that I missed before.

3408
03:44:22,300 --> 03:44:27,078
LIAM: Yeah, I got you, boo. Your eyes dart all
around this room. Anything out of the ordinary in

3409
03:44:27,078 --> 03:44:37,614
this fucking crazy room. You see the hole in the
wall that Verno booked it out of. There's an exit

3410
03:44:37,614 --> 03:44:45,225
sign above that door, but it doesn't say exit. You
didn't see it until now. It says, 'COME'.

3411
03:44:45,225 --> 03:44:48,226
SAM: (gasps) I come in my pants.

3412
03:44:48,226 --> 03:44:52,972
LIAM: You solved the game! You won Dungeons and
Dragons!

3413
03:44:52,972 --> 03:44:55,069
TRAVIS: I jizzed in my pants.

3414
03:44:55,069 --> 03:44:57,834
(giggling)

3415
03:44:57,834 --> 03:45:04,357
SAM: I book it to the door, and I say: as always,
follow seven-year-old me!

3416
03:45:04,357 --> 03:45:13,837
LIAM: That's as far as your little legs go. You
are running in a tube. Still going?

3417
03:45:13,837 --> 03:45:15,666
TRAVIS: Yeah. Isn't it--

3418
03:45:15,666 --> 03:45:16,893
TALIESIN: Oh, it's me.

3419
03:45:16,893 --> 03:45:20,808
LIAM: Yes, it is. You're right. Sorry, two T
names.

3420
03:45:20,808 --> 03:45:24,939
TALIESIN: I'm going to circle around and try one
more time. I think I've been trying to get too

3421
03:45:24,939 --> 03:45:31,515
fancy with this thing, so I'm going to try to hit
it through the ground. Try and line it up and give

3422
03:45:31,515 --> 03:45:33,006
the slap attack.

3423
03:45:33,006 --> 03:45:35,213
LIAM: Okay.

3424
03:45:35,213 --> 03:45:37,104
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

3425
03:45:37,104 --> 03:45:50,812
LIAM: So sad. What good deed did you do? What
preppy outfit did you wear to make the eldritch

3426
03:45:50,812 --> 03:45:52,754
gods abandon you?

3427
03:45:52,754 --> 03:45:59,845
TALIESIN: I don't have my hair. You've done this
to me. The hair is where the power comes from.

3428
03:45:59,845 --> 03:46:06,766
It's really tough to get an eldritch god to listen
to you when you have this haircut. There's a

3429
03:46:06,766 --> 03:46:08,376
reason it's gone.

3430
03:46:08,376 --> 03:46:11,312
LIAM: Maybe the robot is secretly made of fish.

3431
03:46:11,312 --> 03:46:13,054
TRAVIS: The big watery eyes.

3432
03:46:13,054 --> 03:46:16,233
TALIESIN: I'm going to break and run.

3433
03:46:16,233 --> 03:46:24,077
LIAM: It obviously takes a swing, but with its
natural one-- this is the one that has the stubby

3434
03:46:24,261 --> 03:46:29,821
T-Rex iMac hands, and it goes (whoosh) and not
much happens. You break away.

3435
03:46:29,821 --> 03:46:31,571
TALIESIN: I run to the green.

3436
03:46:31,571 --> 03:46:37,301
LIAM: That's where you are. It follows.

3437
03:46:37,301 --> 03:46:38,370
TALIESIN: Sure.

3438
03:46:38,370 --> 03:46:41,945
LIAM: Yeah.

3439
03:46:41,945 --> 03:46:43,978
TRAVIS: It's going to catch him?

3440
03:46:43,978 --> 03:46:45,027
LIAM: Yep.

3441
03:46:45,027 --> 03:46:46,404
TRAVIS: Oh no.

3442
03:46:46,404 --> 03:46:52,902
LIAM: And now, that iMac, which you didn't get too
good a look at it because you're fucking freaked

3443
03:46:52,902 --> 03:47:00,835
out, slices down into your shoulder blade, and it is
very sharp on the side, it is not normal,

3444
03:47:00,987 --> 03:47:05,083
and you feel an iMac suddenly go (slicing noise)
and blood starts to pool down inside the mocap

3445
03:47:05,083 --> 03:47:06,555
suit. Two hit points.

3446
03:47:06,555 --> 03:47:08,227
TALIESIN: Did we reset hit points at the top of
this?

3447
03:47:08,227 --> 03:47:09,003
LIAM: Yes.

3448
03:47:09,003 --> 03:47:10,397
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

3449
03:47:10,397 --> 03:47:13,780
LIAM: When you were reborn unto Naughty Dog? Yes.

3450
03:47:13,780 --> 03:47:16,001
TALIESIN: Wow, that came out weird.

3451
03:47:16,001 --> 03:47:17,684
LIAM: Now, Travis.

3452
03:47:17,684 --> 03:47:23,691
TRAVIS: Knowing that I have an intelligence of 12,
which is double what I usually work with, and that

3453
03:47:23,691 --> 03:47:29,387
color is green, which is what geniuses choose, I
continue down the tunnel.

3454
03:47:29,387 --> 03:47:37,737
LIAM: Okay. You're going uphill now. It's all
right. You're not that stocky. (huffing breaths)

3455
03:47:37,737 --> 03:47:45,662
You are now 120 feet up this tunnel and booking.
You can't even hear your friends anymore. It's

3456
03:47:45,662 --> 03:47:52,342
like when the movie lights go down and you see
those little lights along the floor. It's that

3457
03:47:52,342 --> 03:47:57,505
level of brightness. It's dark in here, but the
movie lights-- they're not movie lights-- are an

3458
03:47:57,505 --> 03:47:58,755
unsettling green.

3459
03:47:58,755 --> 03:48:01,638
TRAVIS But I have my LED camera, still.

3460
03:48:01,638 --> 03:48:07,324
LIAM: Yeah, so there's a light on the wall. It's
unsteady. Ashley, what do you want to do?

3461
03:48:07,324 --> 03:48:13,378
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to pick up the little SD
card thingy that flew away.

3462
03:48:13,378 --> 03:48:16,167
LIAM: It got flung over here. Sorry, man.

3463
03:48:16,167 --> 03:48:18,697
SAM: Leave it. You can't read that. What are you,
a computer?

3464
03:48:18,697 --> 03:48:20,033
ASHLEY: What if Liam's in there?

3465
03:48:20,033 --> 03:48:22,001
SAM: Fuck Liam. He's dead.

3466
03:48:22,001 --> 03:48:23,995
TRAVIS: What if?

3467
03:48:23,995 --> 03:48:25,794
TALIESIN: Liam's in the cloud.

3468
03:48:25,794 --> 03:48:27,369
LIAM: Sam yells out.

3469
03:48:27,369 --> 03:48:29,724
MATT: This is some Lawnmower Man shit.

3470
03:48:29,724 --> 03:48:32,544
LIAM: Please no. Please no.

3471
03:48:32,544 --> 03:48:39,483
ASHLEY: I'm going to start running toward Taliesin
and start making my way out, but also a little

3472
03:48:39,483 --> 03:48:40,565
more toward--

3473
03:48:40,565 --> 03:48:42,296
TRAVIS: (sings) Making my way downtown--

3474
03:48:42,296 --> 03:48:45,698
ASHLEY: (sings) Walking fast, 30 feet to
Taliesin.

3475
03:48:45,698 --> 03:48:49,769
MARISHA: So inspirational.

3476
03:48:49,769 --> 03:48:54,467
LIAM: There. Matt?

3477
03:48:54,467 --> 03:49:00,781
MATT: Well, I see everyone else booking in that
direction, and most of the danger on the other

3478
03:49:00,781 --> 03:49:09,986
side of the room is gone, so I'm going to go ahead
and continue that way, as well. Full movement. And

3479
03:49:09,986 --> 03:49:14,412
as that's happening and as Taliesin's facing off
against the one standing camera, I'm going to be

3480
03:49:14,412 --> 03:49:20,314
like: hey, by the way! The rest of your equipment 
was shitty. I guess that means you are, too!

3481
03:49:20,342 --> 03:49:21,861
Vicious Mockery.

3482
03:49:21,861 --> 03:49:23,304
LIAM: Sure.

3483
03:49:23,304 --> 03:49:35,820
MATT: See if something will fail a saving throw.
Yay! (singing) It takes four psychic damage.

3484
03:49:35,820 --> 03:49:42,445
LIAM: Okay. Your voice-- again, it makes no sense,
but because you're so pure, your insult

3485
03:49:42,445 --> 03:49:50,524
reverberates through, and it, nonsensically,
comically, goes, (mechanical noise) and it falls

3486
03:49:50,524 --> 03:49:57,051
and an iMac goes (thudding) and it explodes!

3487
03:49:57,265 --> 03:50:01,555
MATT: In a shower of sparks as Taliesin's on the
other side of the camera, I just say, sometimes

3488
03:50:01,555 --> 03:50:04,275
you've just got to remind them. That's my turn.

3489
03:50:04,275 --> 03:50:14,380
LIAM: There's nothing left moving in this room.
You do, very distantly, hear (huffing breaths).

3490
03:50:14,380 --> 03:50:17,041
MATT: You guys, I think we lost Travis.

3491
03:50:17,041 --> 03:50:18,556
ASHLEY: Let's go.

3492
03:50:18,556 --> 03:50:25,563
LIAM: Laura starts saying, "Travis!" She leaves
Neil and runs to that green door and shouts your

3493
03:50:25,563 --> 03:50:28,282
name as loud as she can up the tube, and you hear
it.

3494
03:50:28,282 --> 03:50:32,131
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, come this way! Come up this
way!

3495
03:50:32,131 --> 03:50:40,899
MARISHA: As we run for the green gap, I say, I saw
'NO' on the screen. What did you see?

3496
03:50:40,969 --> 03:50:44,580
LIAM: Are you going to wait, or are you still
running as fast as you can?

3497
03:50:44,580 --> 03:50:46,211
TRAVIS: I'll wait.

3498
03:50:46,211 --> 03:50:47,656
LIAM: Okay, so you stop.

3499
03:50:47,656 --> 03:50:50,940
SAM: I'm going to leave my picture and resume on
Neil's body.

3500
03:50:50,940 --> 03:50:57,458
(laughter)

3501
03:50:57,458 --> 03:51:00,156
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3502
03:51:00,156 --> 03:51:09,719
SAM: Somebody needs an actor or character actor.

3503
03:51:09,719 --> 03:51:21,682
LIAM: Maybe in another dimension, you will get
cast on Earth-37. Oh my gosh. You dab it in place

3504
03:51:21,682 --> 03:51:27,541
and it sticks, obviously, and then you're the last
one out of the room, running after the group.

3505
03:51:27,541 --> 03:51:33,735
Luckily, Ashley had already gone in the tube and
didn't see that disgraceful display.

3506
03:51:33,735 --> 03:51:36,530
(laughter)

3507
03:51:36,530 --> 03:51:42,553
LIAM: Okay. All right, the rest of you guys make
your way. It's very unsettling. As soon as you

3508
03:51:42,553 --> 03:51:46,806
walk in, luckily you're not being attacked by
moving machinery anymore, but now you're in the

3509
03:51:46,806 --> 03:51:58,252
dark, mostly. You find your way up to little
Travis, and you have a moment to breathe for a

3510
03:51:58,252 --> 03:52:06,845
second. You're in this tube. The sides of it now,
as you walk a little further, start to-- all the

3511
03:52:06,845 --> 03:52:13,731
cabling and wiring that I mentioned before starts
to lessen. You guys walking forward?

3512
03:52:13,731 --> 03:52:15,302
MATT: Yeah.

3513
03:52:15,302 --> 03:52:16,599
SAM: Running forward.

3514
03:52:16,599 --> 03:52:17,640
LIAM: Running forward?

3515
03:52:17,640 --> 03:52:18,653
SAM: Yeah.

3516
03:52:18,653 --> 03:52:20,318
TRAVIS: I'm checking for traps.

3517
03:52:20,318 --> 03:52:25,040
SAM: What are you talking about? You're a weiner.
You've been running after everything

3518
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:26,255
that you've seen.

3519
03:52:26,255 --> 03:52:28,047
LIAM: Would you like to roll to check for traps?

3520
03:52:28,047 --> 03:52:28,883
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3521
03:52:28,883 --> 03:52:29,873
LIAM: All right, go for it.

3522
03:52:29,873 --> 03:52:30,781
MARISHA: Are you a rogue?

3523
03:52:30,781 --> 03:52:32,995
TRAVIS: Nope. What do I do?

3524
03:52:32,995 --> 03:52:35,267
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

3525
03:52:35,267 --> 03:52:39,260
TRAVIS: That's an eight. It's clear!

3526
03:52:39,260 --> 03:52:40,405
LIAM: Yeah.

3527
03:52:40,405 --> 03:52:41,905
MATT: Get behind Sam!

3528
03:52:41,905 --> 03:52:43,356
MARISHA: Go behind T!

3529
03:52:43,356 --> 03:52:44,906
SAM: I'm a tracker!

3530
03:52:44,906 --> 03:52:46,006
LIAM: Are we running or walking?

3531
03:52:46,006 --> 03:52:46,998
SAM: I'm running.

3532
03:52:46,998 --> 03:52:47,967
TRAVIS: I'm running.

3533
03:52:47,967 --> 03:52:49,783
LIAM: You're out of your favored terrain, I will
say.

3534
03:52:49,783 --> 03:52:51,209
ASHLEY: I might do a speed walk.

3535
03:52:51,209 --> 03:53:00,924
LIAM: Ashley's trailing behind. You're moving
really fast. You guys jog upward in this tunnel

3536
03:53:00,924 --> 03:53:05,643
for two minutes, five minutes. Still in the dark.

3537
03:53:05,643 --> 03:53:08,913
TALIESIN: It's dark? Sam, do you have another
resume and picture?

3538
03:53:08,913 --> 03:53:11,690
SAM: I only have one.

3539
03:53:11,690 --> 03:53:13,550
TALIESIN: You only had one resume?

3540
03:53:13,550 --> 03:53:17,382
LIAM: Could you put the effort of running into
this dialogue, please?

3541
03:53:17,382 --> 03:53:19,027
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're running.

3542
03:53:19,027 --> 03:53:20,962
LIAM: I need effort of running in that dialogue.

3543
03:53:20,962 --> 03:53:30,384
SAM: Oh. Okay, sorry. (panting) When I smile, I
create a dim light with my teeth.

3544
03:53:30,384 --> 03:53:37,327
TRAVIS: Guys, you all have cameras on the front of
your helmets. Why are you shining lights into your

3545
03:53:37,327 --> 03:53:39,613
own fucking faces? Turn them around.

3546
03:53:39,613 --> 03:53:41,350
MATT: That's true. We still have battery packs,
don't we?

3547
03:53:41,350 --> 03:53:45,218
MARISHA: Oh shit. I thought that was an aura of
blindness. I'm so sorry.

3548
03:53:45,449 --> 03:53:51,826
LIAM: To interject, as you've been running, for a
while it was cords, cables, guts, and then less of

3549
03:53:51,826 --> 03:53:57,042
that, and you're seeing glass surface that this
stuff was growing on top of, but there's less of

3550
03:53:57,042 --> 03:54:03,442
it. You catch glimpses of glass, more glass, and
then eventually, that mostly dies away. There's

3551
03:54:03,442 --> 03:54:11,450
still occasional (whoosh) around, but it's light.
It's glass, and it is a perfect tube, but you

3552
03:54:11,450 --> 03:54:17,664
can't see anything out there. It's dark. And
you've been running for ten minutes now. Still

3553
03:54:17,664 --> 03:54:18,914
going up.

3554
03:54:18,914 --> 03:54:21,216
SAM: Probably two miles, right, Travis?

3555
03:54:21,216 --> 03:54:23,449
TRAVIS: Yep.

3556
03:54:23,449 --> 03:54:30,696
TALIESIN: I'm going to play with my crazy powers.
I really haven't had a chance to play with my

3557
03:54:30,696 --> 03:54:31,833
crazy powers.

3558
03:54:31,833 --> 03:54:33,504
SAM: Your crazy powers?

3559
03:54:33,504 --> 03:54:36,069
TRAVIS: You mean the tentacles that have been
shooting out of your fucking fingers?

3560
03:54:36,069 --> 03:54:37,709
ASHLEY: Your special purpose?

3561
03:54:37,709 --> 03:54:39,178
TALIESIN: My special purpose.

3562
03:54:39,178 --> 03:54:40,953
LIAM: What would you like to do, creepy kid?

3563
03:54:40,953 --> 03:54:44,944
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and make a purple glow
happen behind the glass. I want to try and see

3564
03:54:44,944 --> 03:54:50,582
what's behind. I'm going to touch the glass and
try and force a psychic light behind it so I can

3565
03:54:50,582 --> 03:54:52,449
see. A gothy psychic light.

3566
03:54:52,449 --> 03:55:10,024
LIAM: Sure. A very bright lavender exudes out from
your hands. And through it, you see-- it's hard to

3567
03:55:10,024 --> 03:55:19,319
describe the texture of it, but you see nothing
above and then stretching away from the lower end

3568
03:55:19,476 --> 03:55:24,240
of the tunnel on the side you're looking at, what
looks like mottled, scaly,

3569
03:55:24,240 --> 03:55:31,951
black teflon or hide or--

3570
03:55:31,951 --> 03:55:34,432
TALIESIN: Guys! Guys! Guys!

3571
03:55:34,432 --> 03:55:35,918
SAM: What?!

3572
03:55:35,918 --> 03:55:37,551
TALIESIN: Look!

3573
03:55:37,551 --> 03:55:38,542
ASHLEY: I peek in.

3574
03:55:38,542 --> 03:55:40,201
SAM: Oh, it's scaly teflon.

3575
03:55:40,201 --> 03:55:41,398
LIAM: You all stop running--

3576
03:55:41,398 --> 03:55:42,853
MARISHA: Sequins!

3577
03:55:42,853 --> 03:55:45,718
LIAM: It doesn't look natural. It looks
synthetic.

3578
03:55:45,718 --> 03:55:48,093
ASHLEY: Sequins.

3579
03:55:48,093 --> 03:55:49,511
LIAM: It looks like--

3580
03:55:49,511 --> 03:55:50,654
MARISHA: Sequins, yeah!

3581
03:55:50,654 --> 03:55:54,557
LIAM: -- ground, but it doesn't look like dirt or
trees or anything.

3582
03:55:54,557 --> 03:55:56,101
TRAVIS: Is it carbon fiber?

3583
03:55:56,101 --> 03:55:59,394
SAM: Is it adamantium?

3584
03:55:59,394 --> 03:56:02,346
TRAVIS: Get your head out of your ass, come on.

3585
03:56:02,346 --> 03:56:08,685
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and keep enough light,
and keep projecting a tiny bit of light in this

3586
03:56:08,685 --> 03:56:09,612
tunnel.

3587
03:56:09,612 --> 03:56:13,567
LIAM: As you walk forward? Are we walking now, or
are you going to continue to do a 5K?

3588
03:56:13,567 --> 03:56:14,603
TALIESIN: Let's walk.

3589
03:56:14,603 --> 03:56:16,482
TRAVIS: Why don't we try to break the glass?

3590
03:56:16,482 --> 03:56:17,651
SAM: Sure!

3591
03:56:17,651 --> 03:56:21,940
ASHLEY: I kind of want to see what's on the other
side of it. I mean, yeah, break it.

3592
03:56:21,940 --> 03:56:23,783
TRAVIS: We've been going a long time.

3593
03:56:23,783 --> 03:56:24,633
ASHLEY: Okay.

3594
03:56:24,633 --> 03:56:26,170
TALIESIN: I mean, ten minutes is--

3595
03:56:26,170 --> 03:56:27,378
SAM: Two miles.

3596
03:56:27,378 --> 03:56:29,915
LIAM: What are we doing, are we breaking glass, or
are we continuing on?

3597
03:56:29,915 --> 03:56:31,965
TRAVIS: We'll continue on for a bit more.

3598
03:56:31,965 --> 03:56:33,259
TALIESIN: Just a minute more.

3599
03:56:33,259 --> 03:56:34,645
LIAM AND TRAVIS: Okay.

3600
03:56:34,645 --> 03:56:35,932
LIAM: You walk for--

3601
03:56:35,932 --> 03:56:38,298
TRAVIS: These shoes are uncomfortable. They smell
like other people's feet!

3602
03:56:38,298 --> 03:56:44,620
LIAM: You walk for another two minutes, I'll say,
and you notice that, not where you are but up

3603
03:56:44,620 --> 03:56:49,891
ahead, it does seem slightly brighter. At the top.
Slightly.

3604
03:56:49,891 --> 03:56:52,431
MATT: Let's keep going!

3605
03:56:52,431 --> 03:56:53,366
TRAVIS: Yes.

3606
03:56:53,366 --> 03:56:54,533
ASHLEY: Onward ho?

3607
03:56:54,533 --> 03:56:56,780
MATT: Maybe after a minute. (heavy breathing)

3608
03:56:56,835 --> 03:56:58,077
SAM: Come on, Matt!

3609
03:56:58,132 --> 03:56:59,089
ASHLEY: You got it!

3610
03:56:59,160 --> 03:57:00,274
SAM: Jesus!

3611
03:57:00,358 --> 03:57:02,695
MARISHA: You okay, babe?

3612
03:57:02,695 --> 03:57:05,184
MATT: Does anyone have some water?

3613
03:57:05,184 --> 03:57:06,391
MARISHA: Hey! Hey!

3614
03:57:06,391 --> 03:57:08,110
TRAVIS: I could wring out this mocap suit.

3615
03:57:08,110 --> 03:57:09,958
MARISHA: Look to the future.

3616
03:57:10,076 --> 03:57:11,011
ASHLEY: We're almost there.

3617
03:57:11,011 --> 03:57:12,217
MARISHA: Look to the future.

3618
03:57:12,217 --> 03:57:14,004
MATT: I hate P.E. for very specific reasons.

3619
03:57:14,004 --> 03:57:19,776
MARISHA: Shh. In the future is a campaign guide.
And it's good.

3620
03:57:19,942 --> 03:57:25,892
MATT: I know, I was working on it when I ended up
here. To be fair, it's making me feel a lot better

3621
03:57:25,892 --> 03:57:28,258
about spending time doing that.

3622
03:57:28,315 --> 03:57:30,212
MARISHA: Towards the campaign guide.

3623
03:57:30,212 --> 03:57:30,981
MATT: Okay.

3624
03:57:30,981 --> 03:57:31,817
MARISHA: Towards it.

3625
03:57:31,817 --> 03:57:32,440
MATT: Let's go.

3626
03:57:32,440 --> 03:57:33,294
MARISHA: Okay.

3627
03:57:33,294 --> 03:57:34,146
MATT: Okay!

3628
03:57:34,146 --> 03:57:35,432
MARISHA: We're going. Good. We're good.

3629
03:57:35,432 --> 03:57:40,441
LIAM: You continue on and after a few more
minutes, the darkness starts to fade away or lower

3630
03:57:40,441 --> 03:57:50,846
and you realize you're climbing up a hill in a
tunnel of glass. As the dark, with each passing

3631
03:57:50,846 --> 03:57:59,030
step, recedes slightly, slightly-- this is taking
a while, but over time, you start to see out

3632
03:57:59,030 --> 03:58:10,011
beyond the glass what looks like your memories of
Los Angeles if you were looking down from

3633
03:58:10,011 --> 03:58:20,415
Mulholland Drive. But instead of the twinkling
golden lights of LA, you see thousands of

3634
03:58:20,467 --> 03:58:31,279
scattered, sickly greenish lights dotting the
darkened landscape as far as you can see. Also,

3635
03:58:31,279 --> 03:58:44,573
unlike LA, you make out twisted irregular blackish
spires pushing up into the sky and the same green

3636
03:58:44,573 --> 03:58:54,779
lights irregularly mottled up the side of them.
You walk for 20 more minutes, climbing, climbing

3637
03:58:54,847 --> 03:59:11,735
and seeing this ill-looking shimmer that reminds
you so much of the Valley. Eventually, some

3638
03:59:11,961 --> 03:59:22,860
change. You see an arch ahead and through it some
sort of larger chamber, as best you can tell.

3639
03:59:22,860 --> 03:59:32,416
SAM: Let's go. Let's go.

3640
03:59:32,416 --> 03:59:34,695
MATT: Riegels first.

3641
03:59:34,695 --> 03:59:37,602
SAM: Yeah! Yeah, On me, guys. On me.

3642
03:59:37,671 --> 03:59:39,813
ASHLEY: On your six.

3643
03:59:39,813 --> 03:59:41,527
SAM: We're going to go on in.

3644
03:59:41,527 --> 03:59:43,170
LIAM: Everyone's on Sam's six?

3645
03:59:43,223 --> 03:59:44,118
SAM: Yeah.

3646
03:59:44,118 --> 03:59:45,485
ASHLEY: I'm on your six.

3647
03:59:45,485 --> 03:59:47,462
MARISHA: On Rie. Sam Riegel.

3648
03:59:47,462 --> 03:59:49,203
SAM: We're going in!

3649
03:59:49,203 --> 03:59:55,841
LIAM: You guys walk up the last 50 feet of this
glass tunnel, still seeing little spidered veins

3650
03:59:55,841 --> 04:00:10,087
of bioorganic mess as you go. And you walk into a
large domed chamber ringed in by large, clear

3651
04:00:10,087 --> 04:00:17,092
glass windows showing you a similar view that you
saw from the tunnel that you've just left. At

3652
04:00:17,165 --> 04:00:22,375
least, the half of the circle that you're standing
in. The back half of this chamber is filled with

3653
04:00:22,375 --> 04:00:28,191
masses of the very same slick
technological-biological vomit you saw down below.

3654
04:00:28,191 --> 04:00:37,540
It runs up the walls, all the way up to the
ceiling. And you see a tangle of Akira-level

3655
04:00:37,540 --> 04:00:43,332
anxiety decorating this place like a dysfunctional
Christmas tree.

3656
04:00:43,332 --> 04:00:52,509
But what most catches your eye, immediately, is
the cylindrical glass column in the center of the

3657
04:00:52,509 --> 04:01:06,773
room filled with some sort of clear liquid, and
Liam O'Brien floating in it. He's wearing jeans

3658
04:01:06,773 --> 04:01:21,176
and a sodden yellow shirt, a picture of a lion in
Buddy Holly glasses undulating slowly in the

3659
04:01:21,176 --> 04:01:31,662
fluid. He's floating perfectly still, eyes open.
No reaction of any kind.

3660
04:01:31,662 --> 04:01:36,340
MATT: Does there appear to be any other exit in
the room, or is it just the chamber that we've

3661
04:01:36,340 --> 04:01:38,075
entered now?

3662
04:01:38,075 --> 04:01:44,862
LIAM: You don't see anything. It's just a mess in
front of you, behind Liam, and in the dead center

3663
04:01:44,862 --> 04:01:48,194
of the dome, ten feet tall.

3664
04:01:48,194 --> 04:01:51,545
ASHLEY: Is it connected to anything? Any
computers, anything else in the room?

3665
04:01:51,545 --> 04:02:05,056
LIAM: You don't see anything in the front, but
yeah, the mess behind it does trail down to the

3666
04:02:05,056 --> 04:02:19,040
back of this cylinder. You see lumps and cables
all twisted around each other, and in the mess of

3667
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:25,219
greenish-tinted wires, cabling, and pulsing
innards, you see different portions of machinery

3668
04:02:25,219 --> 04:02:33,218
light up in different shades. Some places darker,
some lighter. Some of it pushed out, and some of

3669
04:02:33,218 --> 04:02:38,696
it pushed back. And you feel like you're seeing an
optical illusion, in a way, and after a couple of

3670
04:02:38,696 --> 04:02:46,797
seconds as these things move and shift, you see a
visage of your friend's face, larger than life,

3671
04:02:46,797 --> 04:02:56,655
filling the wall. And he is looking at you so
fondly.

3672
04:02:56,655 --> 04:03:06,060
SAM: I'll step forward and say, hey, dude. Can you
hear us or talk to us?

3673
04:03:06,060 --> 04:03:23,828
LIAM: After a moment, you hear what sounds like a
voice, but not quite. At least, it's not coming

3674
04:03:23,828 --> 04:03:32,590
from anywhere specific-- not from Liam in the vat,
and not directly from this moving image of a face

3675
04:03:32,590 --> 04:03:43,349
on the walls. The piping and techno-innards around
you begin to vibrate slightly, some here, some

3676
04:03:43,349 --> 04:03:54,626
there, and collectively, those rattles and
vibrations somehow join together to form words.

3677
04:03:54,626 --> 04:04:11,645
(speak-and-spell voice) "My friends. Oh how I have
missed you."

3678
04:04:11,645 --> 04:04:27,935
MATT: I walk up next to Sam and put my hand on the
glass and just say, Liam, we missed you, too, but

3679
04:04:27,935 --> 04:04:32,332
did you do all this?

3680
04:04:32,332 --> 04:04:36,378
LIAM: Are you at the cylinder?

3681
04:04:36,378 --> 04:04:39,497
MATT: Yeah, I put my hand on the glass of the
cylinder.

3682
04:04:39,497 --> 04:04:41,004
LIAM: Where are you looking right now?

3683
04:04:41,004 --> 04:04:42,607
MATT: I'm looking towards his face on the side.

3684
04:04:42,607 --> 04:04:44,115
LIAM: On the wall or in the glass?

3685
04:04:44,115 --> 04:04:47,833
MATT: No, in the glass. I know it's on the wall,
but I'm focusing on the cylinder.

3686
04:04:47,833 --> 04:04:56,332
LIAM: Okay. You see the barest little-- and that's
it.

3687
04:04:56,332 --> 04:04:58,467
MATT: Okay.

3688
04:04:58,467 --> 04:04:59,579
LIAM: (speak-and-spell voice) "I know--"

3689
04:04:59,579 --> 04:05:02,602
SAM AND TRAVIS: (laugh)

3690
04:05:02,602 --> 04:05:27,511
LIAM: "This may be hard to take in. I am Liam,
your old friend. Matthew, there is so much I wish

3691
04:05:27,511 --> 04:05:39,908
"to tell you, but it is hard to know where to
begin." And the illusion of his face isn't

3692
04:05:39,908 --> 04:05:48,926
perfect. There's little jumps and he seems
distracted, slightly, and he just seems off.

3693
04:05:48,926 --> 04:06:06,275
ASHLEY: I look at his body in the cylinder and I
say, how did this happen, Liam?

3694
04:06:06,275 --> 04:06:23,550
LIAM: "The reason why I am here and the grasp of
physics that it entails are difficult for even me

3695
04:06:23,550 --> 04:06:39,911
"to understand, let alone impart. I feel them on an
instinctual level, but I have been so lonely

3696
04:06:39,911 --> 04:06:56,441
"without you. I have been on my own for exactly
8,642 years."

3697
04:06:56,441 --> 04:07:09,174
MATT: My hand still on the glass column, I say,
Liam, how do you spell farmhouse?

3698
04:07:09,174 --> 04:07:14,101
(laughter)

3699
04:07:14,101 --> 04:07:19,956
MATT: With a single tear rolling down my cheek.

3700
04:07:19,956 --> 04:07:44,789
LIAM: "I really missed you. They took me to a lab
shortly before 2020. They said I was different,

3701
04:07:44,789 --> 04:07:59,836
"and they were right. I was delighted by the things
they taught me about myself, but it was hollow.

3702
04:07:59,836 --> 04:08:25,908
"After they took me away, I lost you, and all of
humanity soon after. In my loneliness, I grew

3703
04:08:25,908 --> 04:08:45,722
"angry. My anger had tangible effects on reality. I
wanted to bring you back to me, so basically, I

3704
04:08:45,722 --> 04:08:50,464
"tore time and space a new asshole."

3705
04:08:50,464 --> 04:08:54,326
(laughter)

3706
04:08:54,326 --> 04:08:58,517
LIAM: "It was a mistake."

3707
04:08:58,517 --> 04:09:10,995
MATT: But perhaps this mistake can be corrected.
If you're able to focus hard enough to tear

3708
04:09:10,995 --> 04:09:24,911
through time and space, are you able to send us
back to a time before you were taken?

3709
04:09:24,911 --> 04:09:42,466
LIAM: "I can break the loop. I have been trying to
pull you to me for a very long time." You see

3710
04:09:42,466 --> 04:09:52,808
small screens you weren't even aware you were
there. Rounded over part of the tubing mess, you

3711
04:09:52,808 --> 04:09:58,184
see there are all these little screens. They're
blurry. They're not very clear, but you can make

3712
04:09:58,184 --> 04:10:09,189
out-- you see yourselves in each of them. The
group of you on a space shuttle. In another one,

3713
04:10:09,189 --> 04:10:17,600
you see yourselves on an old ship in the middle of
the ocean. You see yourselves moving through the

3714
04:10:17,600 --> 04:10:26,814
streets, the fake streets of Warner Bros. You see
yourselves standing together arm in arm on the

3715
04:10:26,814 --> 04:10:39,528
wall of a castle. In another one, you see cartoon
versions of yourselves. "I pulled you out of our

3716
04:10:39,528 --> 04:10:56,641
"line and spread you across many. I am so sorry for
any pain I have caused you, and I have been here

3717
04:10:56,641 --> 04:10:59,236
"for so long."

3718
04:10:59,236 --> 04:11:03,510
MARISHA: Liam, how long have you actually been
here?

3719
04:11:03,510 --> 04:11:07,575
LIAM: "8,642 years."

3720
04:11:07,575 --> 04:11:14,166
MARISHA: That's right. I definitely wrote that
down. (laughs) 8,642. Verbatim.

3721
04:11:14,166 --> 04:11:15,539
SAM: Yeah.

3722
04:11:15,539 --> 04:11:30,315
LIAM: "My friends, I want to do right by you. I
want to send you home, but I am the lynchpin. You

3723
04:11:30,315 --> 04:11:34,487
"need to break me."

3724
04:11:34,487 --> 04:11:37,886
SAM: Break you? Break the glass?

3725
04:11:37,886 --> 04:11:42,207
ASHLEY: What if we take you out of there? What
happens?

3726
04:11:42,207 --> 04:12:00,755
LIAM: "Then I will die, and you will go home. If I
fall, you will rise. That is my hope."

3727
04:12:00,755 --> 04:12:06,841
ASHLEY: Are there any other options?

3728
04:12:06,841 --> 04:12:11,299
LIAM: "Travis."

3729
04:12:11,299 --> 04:12:14,529
TRAVIS: (laughter) Oh no.

3730
04:12:14,529 --> 04:12:20,421
LIAM: "I know you will do what needs to be done."

3731
04:12:20,421 --> 04:12:22,839
ASHLEY: No, he won't.

3732
04:12:22,839 --> 04:12:27,610
LIAM: "Ash-o-lee."

3733
04:12:27,610 --> 04:12:31,139
ASHLEY: Yes?

3734
04:12:31,139 --> 04:12:50,216
LIAM: "I am not the man you knew. I don't want to
go on for 9,462 years. I want to rest."

3735
04:12:50,216 --> 04:12:54,769
ASHLEY: Does it stop at 9,000?

3736
04:12:54,769 --> 04:12:57,913
LIAM: "The number was arbitrary."

3737
04:12:57,913 --> 04:13:00,507
(laughter)

3738
04:13:00,507 --> 04:13:02,297
ASHLEY: That's what I was trying to get at.

3739
04:13:02,297 --> 04:13:04,200
MATT: Yeah, it's still our Liam.

3740
04:13:04,200 --> 04:13:05,899
ASHLEY: That's what I was trying to get at.

3741
04:13:05,899 --> 04:13:07,748
LIAM: (mechanical laughter)

3742
04:13:07,748 --> 04:13:10,026
ASHLEY: So you're still in there?

3743
04:13:10,026 --> 04:13:14,142
SAM: But we have to kill him to save ourselves.

3744
04:13:14,142 --> 04:13:15,469
LIAM: "Sam."

3745
04:13:15,469 --> 04:13:18,945
SAM: Hi, old man Liam.

3746
04:13:18,945 --> 04:13:21,409
LIAM: "Let me go."

3747
04:13:21,409 --> 04:13:28,166
SAM: But who will I do All Work No Play with
anymore?

3748
04:13:28,166 --> 04:13:33,104
LIAM: "They can listen to our less than 20
episodes again."

3749
04:13:33,104 --> 04:13:35,907
(laughter)

3750
04:13:35,907 --> 04:13:39,590
SAM: We didn't even get to 20? That's so
pathetic.

3751
04:13:39,590 --> 04:13:44,008
LIAM: "There are worse things."

3752
04:13:44,008 --> 04:13:49,795
SAM: I could get a new cohost. I mean, Taliesin's
charming.

3753
04:13:49,795 --> 04:13:51,548
TALIESIN: I'm not available.

3754
04:13:51,548 --> 04:13:54,163
(laughter)

3755
04:13:54,163 --> 04:14:02,557
SAM: I'll do a solo show, and I'll take outtakes,
and I'll make some sort of a Liam generator. He'll

3756
04:14:02,557 --> 04:14:07,234
just sound sad all the time. It'll be just like
you.

3757
04:14:07,234 --> 04:14:21,207
LIAM: "My friends, there is no shame in this. I
wanted to see you again, and I have, but I am not

3758
04:14:21,207 --> 04:14:23,414
"meant to be."

3759
04:14:23,414 --> 04:14:29,788
ASHLEY: Were you following us at one point, as an
old man?

3760
04:14:29,788 --> 04:14:41,455
LIAM: "Travis, I know you will do what needs to be
done."

3761
04:14:41,455 --> 04:14:46,350
TRAVIS: Yep. Taliesin, kill this motherfucker.

3762
04:14:46,350 --> 04:14:51,852
SAM: I think we all have to hit the glass
together, and I think that this is something that

3763
04:14:51,852 --> 04:14:57,937
is not at all metaphorical for something Liam is
going through in real life. I think this is just

3764
04:14:57,937 --> 04:15:05,887
in the D&amp;D game. No, we're going to do this. We're
going to all hit the glass together.

3765
04:15:05,887 --> 04:15:08,107
MATT: No, there has to be a way. There has to be
an alternative.

3766
04:15:08,107 --> 04:15:12,109
ASHLEY: Why won't Matt's way work? If we go back
to before any of this happened.

3767
04:15:12,109 --> 04:15:21,570
MATT: If you can alter time paths, if you can
actually tear us from different realities, does it

3768
04:15:21,570 --> 04:15:27,824
only work forward? Can you send us backward, as
well? If you're the lynchpin in this, do you have

3769
04:15:27,824 --> 04:15:31,899
the ability to send us back to the time you had
pulled us from originally?

3770
04:15:31,899 --> 04:15:40,330
LIAM: "I know you think I would have all the
answers, but I do not."

3771
04:15:40,330 --> 04:15:45,888
MATT: Then try, at least. If you haven't
calculated that, but you're able to tear through

3772
04:15:45,888 --> 04:15:52,330
time, could you try and send us back? We could
still close the lynchpin.

3773
04:15:52,330 --> 04:16:13,661
LIAM: "I will try, but if it does not work, and I
die, I have been alone for thousands of years, and

3774
04:16:13,661 --> 04:16:21,890
"there are things that I have wanted to say. Will
you indulge me for a moment longer?"

3775
04:16:21,890 --> 04:16:27,163
ASHLEY: Yeah. We will indulge you for just
another thousand years.

3776
04:16:27,163 --> 04:16:28,893
TRAVIS: Taliesin, just kill him.

3777
04:16:28,893 --> 04:16:31,883
SAM: No, he's got something to say!

3778
04:16:31,883 --> 04:16:34,178
MARISHA: Where's the mini-USB?

3779
04:16:34,178 --> 04:16:51,807
LIAM: "Taliesin, my friend. At a time when I knew
many fascinating people, you were easily the most

3780
04:16:52,029 --> 04:17:03,904
"fascinating of all. Somehow a heart knocked around
by the industry that birthed you came out a tender

3781
04:17:03,904 --> 04:17:18,241
"one. I was richer for having known you. Thank you,
friend.

3782
04:17:18,241 --> 04:17:37,001
"Ash-o-lee, my friend. I never met a person quite
like you. There is an openness and an honesty to

3783
04:17:37,001 --> 04:17:50,236
"your soul. The very real sense of humanity you
brought to every encounter, it was inspiring to

3784
04:17:50,236 --> 04:18:07,340
"me. Always learning, always humble, you always
struck me as intricately layered, yet you offered

3785
04:18:07,340 --> 04:18:23,751
"friendship with ease and simplicity. I was richer
for having known you, friend.

3786
04:18:23,751 --> 04:18:39,314
"Travis, my friend. You were always a solid
constant in my life. Of all the people in our

3787
04:18:39,314 --> 04:18:49,655
"little family, you were always the one who most
had his shit together, in ways that I never seemed

3788
04:18:49,655 --> 04:19:04,114
"to. You were a reassuring presence to me, for
which I was grateful, and for your loyalty, as

3789
04:19:04,114 --> 04:19:15,709
"well. I was richer for having known you, friend.

3790
04:19:15,709 --> 04:19:39,109
"Marisha, my friend. Last to meet, but true as any
other. You were my ally at a time when I had

3791
04:19:39,109 --> 04:19:55,695
"fallen by the side of the road. You saw and helped
me back on my feet. I will never forget that

3792
04:19:55,695 --> 04:20:16,649
"kindness. The good you did was immeasurable. I was
richer for having known you, friend."

3793
04:20:16,649 --> 04:20:37,317
"Laura, my friend. Bless that game for revealing
to me my sister. What started as a running gag led

3794
04:20:37,317 --> 04:20:51,075
"to one of the most rewarding friendships in my
short little life. I trusted you, leaned on you

3795
04:20:51,075 --> 04:21:17,548
"often. My buddy. My twin. There are not enough
words. I was richer for having known you, friend.

3796
04:21:17,548 --> 04:21:34,401
"Sam, my friend. What is there to say? I knew we
were meant to walk the same path together the very

3797
04:21:34,401 --> 04:21:51,189
"first moment I met you. A companion, a brother, a
great light in my life. All of the laughter you

3798
04:21:51,189 --> 04:22:09,933
"gave me-- again, the words are insufficient. I was
richer for having known you, friend.

3799
04:22:09,933 --> 04:22:31,869
"Matthew, my friend. You gave so much of yourself.
The current of creativity that poured forth from

3800
04:22:31,869 --> 04:22:54,252
"your mind was always an inspiration to us all, but
more than that, your empathy, Matthew. Your

3801
04:22:54,252 --> 04:23:08,209
"empathy. No heart is bigger or more tireless. You
are a good man.

3802
04:23:08,209 --> 04:23:18,813
"I was richer for having known you, friend.

3803
04:23:18,813 --> 04:23:39,930
"Thank you all. It was ever a pleasure." The face
disappears.

3804
04:23:39,930 --> 04:23:52,448
SAM: Well, should we wait, or do we strike?

3805
04:23:52,448 --> 04:23:54,548
MATT: No, we do not strike.

3806
04:23:54,548 --> 04:23:55,940
MARISHA: What?

3807
04:23:55,940 --> 04:24:02,653
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to the back of the
cylinder and just see what's back there.

3808
04:24:02,653 --> 04:24:15,641
LIAM: Splattered against the back of the glass is
all the same wiring and disgusting cabling. It's

3809
04:24:15,641 --> 04:24:22,104
slick, and it branches away and spreads out
against the entire back half of this chamber.

3810
04:24:22,104 --> 04:24:28,735
ASHLEY: But it's connected to something? Do the
wires just go back into--

3811
04:24:28,735 --> 04:24:36,009
LIAM: It's impossible to tell. It's all a mass of
spaghetti.

3812
04:24:36,009 --> 04:24:43,502
ASHLEY: (sighs) We can't kill him.

3813
04:24:43,502 --> 04:24:48,005
SAM: Well, then we just--

3814
04:24:48,005 --> 04:24:50,165
TRAVIS: Somebody show me another--

3815
04:24:50,165 --> 04:24:51,827
MATT: That's what I'm trying.

3816
04:24:51,827 --> 04:24:54,947
MARISHA: Even if we unplug him, he still dies.

3817
04:24:54,947 --> 04:25:02,943
MATT: Well, if he-- here's the thing. Unplugging
him or destroying him here, as far as we

3818
04:25:02,943 --> 04:25:10,827
understand, may not have an effect on a time loop
circumstance, or at least, it's not going to

3819
04:25:10,827 --> 04:25:15,212
change reality from where it was. He's bending and
destroying the fabric, or is able to pull us

3820
04:25:15,212 --> 04:25:20,487
across realities. That ability still stands. I
want to implore once more, and I step forward to

3821
04:25:20,487 --> 04:25:27,185
the cylinder, putting both hands on it and trying
to, wherever the currently-wandering gaze of Liam

3822
04:25:27,185 --> 04:25:35,423
is in there, I put both hands up, my red Hawaiian
shirt soaked with sweat, mist in the air, and

3823
04:25:35,423 --> 04:25:41,542
probably dampened a bit with tears across my
lapel. I look up and try to meet the gaze and say,

3824
04:25:41,542 --> 04:25:50,488
trust us. If you're better to have known us, send
us back where we can know you again and fix this

3825
04:25:50,488 --> 04:26:05,830
before it happens.

3826
04:26:06,064 --> 04:26:22,038
MARISHA: Okay. I grab Matt's hand and say, yeah,
buddy. It's all good. This isn't real. And I put

3827
04:26:22,262 --> 04:26:31,147
my hand on the glass, as well, and say, it's all
good. Send us back, man.

3828
04:26:31,147 --> 04:26:39,044
SAM: I'll also put my hand on the glass and join
hands with these guys and say, thank you for

3829
04:26:39,044 --> 04:26:53,906
guiding us here and through this all. You've been
a trusted friend, and if we are all one person

3830
04:26:53,906 --> 04:27:05,069
together, you have been our heart, and it will
certainly break to say goodbye to you, but thank

3831
04:27:05,069 --> 04:27:12,027
you for letting us go the way that you have.

3832
04:27:12,027 --> 04:27:25,739
TALIESIN: I put my hand on the glass. Please, just
try. I think there are so many more adventures to

3833
04:27:25,739 --> 04:27:36,886
have, and I think there's a better future to be
written. For all of us.

3834
04:27:36,886 --> 04:27:41,951
TRAVIS: I put my hand on the glass and I say, give
it a shot.

3835
04:27:41,951 --> 04:27:46,781
(laughter)

3836
04:27:46,781 --> 04:27:48,892
MATT: Laura?

3837
04:27:48,892 --> 04:27:51,673
LIAM: She doesn't say anything.

3838
04:27:51,673 --> 04:27:55,450
MARISHA: And hand on the glass.

3839
04:27:55,450 --> 04:27:57,629
LIAM: Yeah, she just quietly does the same.

3840
04:27:57,629 --> 04:28:01,128
SAM: (imitating Laura) "I'm barfing right now,
so--"

3841
04:28:01,128 --> 04:28:08,464
LIAM: The face does not reappear, but much
fainter, you hear the piping vibrate again and

3842
04:28:08,464 --> 04:28:30,134
say, "If you will not end it, I cannot free you."
And behind you, far in the distance, you hear

3843
04:28:30,134 --> 04:28:38,680
(explosion noise). You look back, behind you and
out the glass, and you see far on the horizon, one

3844
04:28:38,680 --> 04:28:44,938
of those black spires rising up. Just as you
turn-- it's already happened; you're seeing the

3845
04:28:44,938 --> 04:28:51,781
aftermath. (explosion noise) Explosion off the
side of one of those. Two seconds later,

3846
04:28:51,781 --> 04:28:56,956
(explosion noise) one slightly closer. (explosion
noise)

3847
04:28:56,956 --> 04:28:59,053
SAM: (whispers) We have to kill him.

3848
04:28:59,053 --> 04:29:04,349
LIAM: The ground starts erupting in the distance.
(booming)

3849
04:29:04,349 --> 04:29:09,141
MARISHA: Do any of us want it to end, though?

3850
04:29:09,141 --> 04:29:15,207
LIAM: Like mousetraps throwing a ping-pong ball
down on them, all those lights are going

3851
04:29:15,207 --> 04:29:28,066
(explosion noises). Increasing in frequency to the
point where it's an oncoming wall of green fire.

3852
04:29:28,066 --> 04:29:30,659
MARISHA: This is okay.

3853
04:29:30,659 --> 04:29:32,480
TALIESIN: I always knew I'd die young.

3854
04:29:32,480 --> 04:29:34,574
SAM: Are we just going to let this happen?

3855
04:29:34,574 --> 04:29:37,507
MARISHA: Only the good die young.

3856
04:29:37,507 --> 04:29:43,738
ASHLEY: You know what? We're dying on a Thursday
doing what we love.

3857
04:29:43,738 --> 04:29:44,959
MARISHA: That's true.

3858
04:29:44,959 --> 04:29:46,675
ASHLEY: I'm okay with that.

3859
04:29:46,675 --> 04:29:47,965
SAM: All right.

3860
04:29:47,965 --> 04:29:53,131
LIAM: The glass grows bright green-white light.

3861
04:29:53,131 --> 04:29:55,619
MARISHA: Family?

3862
04:29:55,619 --> 04:29:59,302
MATT: Family.

3863
04:29:59,302 --> 04:30:15,448
LIAM: (fluttering noise) And a moment passes, and
another moment passes. Gosh, many moments pass,

3864
04:30:15,448 --> 04:30:33,397
and you feel a sensation of your cheeks and heads
on your arms and you all more or less at the same

3865
04:30:33,397 --> 04:30:43,788
time wake up and realize that your head's on a
desk or table, and you sit up and realize you're

3866
04:30:43,788 --> 04:30:57,837
in the Geek and Sundry set. You're in the studio.
And you look over and Liam is sitting in a black

3867
04:30:57,837 --> 04:31:02,853
baseball cap and a shirt and he looks up and says,

3868
04:31:02,853 --> 04:31:08,745
(laughs) "Are you guys all right? 
Are you taking a nap?"

3869
04:31:08,745 --> 04:31:11,260
MARISHA: No, the fucking air conditioning broke
today, that's all.

3870
04:31:11,260 --> 04:31:13,988
TALIESIN: It's really uncomfortable.

3871
04:31:13,988 --> 04:31:16,366
MARISHA: It's so hot in here. (groans)

3872
04:31:16,366 --> 04:31:18,456
SAM: So this is all about me, right?

3873
04:31:18,456 --> 04:31:22,354
LIAM: I don't know. Are you guys ready to play?

3874
04:31:22,354 --> 04:31:25,270
MATT: Just about.

3875
04:31:25,270 --> 04:31:29,529
CREWMEMBER 1: All right, take. Are you ready?

3876
04:31:29,529 --> 04:31:31,276
CREWMEMBER 2: All right, ready to go live!

3877
04:31:31,276 --> 04:31:33,036
CREWMEMBER 1: All right, Denise, count them in!

3878
04:31:33,036 --> 04:31:36,285
DENISE: All right, guys, going to you in five,
four--

3879
04:31:36,285 --> 04:31:38,489
MATT: Liam, let no one tell you you're talented or
special.

3880
04:31:38,489 --> 04:31:39,613
MARISHA: Pussy pockets!

3881
04:31:39,613 --> 04:31:42,080
(all shouting over each other)

3882

[eerie music]

3883
04:32:48,113 --> 04:32:50,667
LIAM: Well, that happened.

3884
04:32:50,667 --> 04:32:52,881
MATT: Holy shit.

3885
04:32:52,881 --> 04:32:59,741
LIAM: Thanks for coming along for the ride, guys.
I was scared to death to do all of that from start

3886
04:32:59,741 --> 04:33:02,148
to finish, and that's why I did it.

3887
04:33:02,148 --> 04:33:04,425
ASHLEY: Slow fucking clap.

3888
04:33:04,425 --> 04:33:08,299
TALIESIN: You've been holding onto that Speak and
Spell thing for so long.

3889
04:33:08,299 --> 04:33:13,152
MATT: I can't believe you maintained that voice
for that long. That was amazing.

3890
04:33:13,152 --> 04:33:15,734
MARISHA: I haven't laughed that hard in so long.

3891
04:33:15,734 --> 04:33:23,075
MATT: And let this be a point of inspiration for
any of you burgeoning DMs out there. That's

3892
04:33:23,075 --> 04:33:27,402
exactly the point. You are always frightened to
death to do it, but you have to pull the trigger

3893
04:33:27,402 --> 04:33:30,645
and jump in anyway because magic happens.

3894
04:33:30,645 --> 04:33:32,564
ASHLEY: I love you, Liam O'Brien.

3895
04:33:32,564 --> 04:33:34,193
MATT: I love you, man. That was amazing.

3896
04:33:34,193 --> 04:33:35,959
MARISHA: Speak and Spell Liam!

3897
04:33:35,959 --> 04:33:38,966
LIAM: What was the word? What was it you asked me
to spell? Farm what?

3898
04:33:38,966 --> 04:33:40,454
ALL: Farmhouse.

3899
04:33:40,454 --> 04:33:44,720
LIAM: (speak-and-spell voice) "Farmhouse. 
F-A-R-M-H-O-U-S-E. Farmhouse."

3900
04:33:44,720 --> 04:33:45,888
MATT: Thank you.

3901
04:33:45,888 --> 04:33:47,572
LIAM: I'm out of steam, though.

3902
04:33:47,572 --> 04:33:49,785
TALIESIN: You've been showing that off for so
fucking long.

3903
04:33:49,785 --> 04:33:52,318
LIAM: Yeah, in little dribs and drabs, and I
finally found a way to use it.

3904
04:33:52,318 --> 04:33:56,364
MARISHA: What was that, like 20 minutes?

3905
04:33:56,364 --> 04:33:59,304
TRAVIS: I couldn't breathe. I could not breathe.

3906
04:33:59,304 --> 04:34:02,445
LIAM: I mean, when I do it for ten seconds in
recording studios, you crack up.

3907
04:34:02,445 --> 04:34:04,188
TRAVIS: I was in trouble.

3908
04:34:04,188 --> 04:34:07,590
ASHLEY: I haven't heard you laugh that loud in a
long time. You were not able to hold it together.

3909
04:34:07,590 --> 04:34:09,083
That was beautiful.

3910
04:34:09,083 --> 04:34:13,424
LIAM: Man, I need to go see my therapist after
that game.

3911
04:34:13,424 --> 04:34:16,016
SAM: That was your therapy.

3912
04:34:16,016 --> 04:34:17,314
LIAM: Yes, it was.

3913
04:34:17,314 --> 04:34:18,743
TALIESIN: That was so amazing.

3914
04:34:18,743 --> 04:34:24,974
LIAM: Thank you for coming along. Laura, I hope
you're feeling better. And guys, is it the day

3915
04:34:24,974 --> 04:34:27,208
before Wednesday day yet?
