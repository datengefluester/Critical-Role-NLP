NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.244
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episodes of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:05.833
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons!

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.770
SAM: Yay!

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.289
MATT: We have returning this week our fantastic
guests, Ashly Burch and Sumalee Montano. They've

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.881
been amazing, we're excited to have them back, and
going to see what this next adventure of the

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.777
story's going to have. Before we get to that, we
have some announcements to get through, beginning

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:25.828
with our fantastic sponsor and friends at D&D
Beyond. Sam?

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:32.109
SAM: D&D Beyond, everybody, two new products have
been announced on D&D Beyond. The Guildmaster's

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:40.084
Guide to Ravnica, alternate title is That's So
Ravnica, available for preorder now on the D&D

00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:46.121
Beyond marketplace, officially will be released on
November 9th. Also, The Wayfarer's Guide to

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:53.041
Eberron, alternate title, The Werfernder's Gerd to
Erberron, available for purchase now on the D&D

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.861
Beyond marketplace. As a reminder, anyone who
already has purchased the Legendary bundle can

00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:04.933
pre-order or purchase these and any future content
at a 15% discount, everyone. Which has the savings

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:12.212
baked right in. I've been using D&D Beyond for a
while now, and they just redid their layout, took

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:20.122
me a while to get used to it. For those of you at
home using D&D Beyond, I have a couple of tips,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:28.793
pointers, for the new layout, to remind myself
where things are layed out. It's like little

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:36.565
mnemonics. It's a weird thing. On the right side
of the screen, you can remember "L E F," so right

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:44.919
sort of like, LEF, left, sort of. That's where
loot, equipment and features are. On the left, is

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:55.671
"I A A," insight and awareness. I'll put that down
here. Then in the middle, is "A T R," which is

00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:00.953
things you can add to roll. ATR.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:03.291
LIAM: I have a mounting sense of dread.

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:16.128
SAM: Right up top is "M S T," which is makes
saving throws. That's what you add to make saving

00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:30.223
throws. That's Sam's little guide to how you can
remember the layout of D&D Beyond. And that's it!

00:02:30.223 --> 00:02:36.463
MATT: Thank you, Sam! I hope that was as useful to
you folks as it will never be to any of us. Thank

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:43.140
you to D&D Beyond for being our awesome sponsor.
Onto the next bit of business. For those who

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.393
haven't seen the announcement we had today, we are
headed to London MCM Comic Expo in October,

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:54.910
actually. October 27th and 28th, Critical Role
will be in London! Super excited about that. We're

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.441
looking forward to meeting a lot of you European
Critters out there. We've been trying to get an

00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.550
opportunity to go over there for a while, so glad
we finally have the chance to come and hang out

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.157
with you folks across the pond. You can go to
critrole.com for details on it, and we look

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:12.142
forward to seeing you then. Also, as a reminder
for next week, we will not be broadcasting an

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:19.562
episode next Thursday. Instead, we'll be doing a
live broadcast Friday evening from Indianapolis.

00:03:19.562 --> 00:03:25.567
It will be airing, this is Friday, August 3rd, at
9:00pm Eastern time, that's 6:00pm Pacific. So

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:29.748
it'll be an hour earlier than what you are used
to, but it'll be our live show at the Murat

00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:34.457
Theater in Indianapolis. Super excited about that.
It's going to be crazy. It's going to be

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:41.493
absolutely nuts. Other than that as well, we have
up on our YouTube channel now the VOD of our Vox

00:03:41.493 --> 00:03:46.103
Machina character buildout for Pillars of Eternity
II: Deadfire. I went ahead and messed around on

00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:51.109
stream for about an hour or so earlier this week
to show you guys my interpretation of building our

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.891
first campaign characters, Vox Machina, in Pillars
of Eternity II: Deadfire, and if you want to check

00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.437
it out, it's on the YouTube. That's
youtube.com/criticalrole, and you get to watch me

00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:04.134
make each character, and we hang out.

00:04:04.134 --> 00:04:05.561
SAM: I watched part of it.

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:06.195
MATT: Did you really?

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.729
SAM: It was pretty good, and I might watch it
again so I can actually build those characters.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.689
MATT: I think you should, that surprised me. I've
never really done a live stream of just myself

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.162
playing a video game before, so that was very new
experience for me. Thank you for your patience. Go

00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:26.132
check it out if you want to. Be sure to check out
the Beast of Winter DLC for Deadfire is coming out

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:32.220
soon. You can pick up the game at
versesevil.com/criticalrole, and it's a fun one,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.471
so check it out if you haven't yet. Reminder that
we do our Wyrmwood giveaways during the breaks,

00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:42.370
and they're going to be happening over here at the
Critical Role Twitch chat, so I'll prompt you when

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.099
we come to our mid break today, but we need you to
come over to the Critical Role chat to enter the

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.729
giveaway, and then head on back to Geek & Sundry,
or wherever else you're watching. That'll be at

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.894
twitch.tv/criticalrole. Talks Machina, our after
show discussion about what happens this week will

00:04:58.894 --> 00:05:07.104
be happening next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here
on the Geek & Sundry Twitch and Alpha, where our

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:12.568
fantastic host Brian W. Foster interviews us, and
makes us feel a little better about ourselves

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:14.959
after the chaos the previous week had.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.875
SAM: I thought you were going to say makes us feel
a little uncomfortable.

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:22.787
MATT: That was the subtext I was going to go into,
but I'll leave that for you, Sam. I believe that's

00:05:22.787 --> 00:05:23.803
all I have--

00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:26.044
SAM: There's no merch, there's nothing merchy?

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:28.992
MARISHA: We made announcements online.

00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:31.503
LIAM: There's brand-new merch, GenCon.

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:35.524
SAM: I'm trying to honor the memory of Laura.

00:05:35.524 --> 00:05:36.632
MATT: It's true!

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:41.481
MARISHA: We're trying to get better at spercing
our announcements out through other things.

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:44.684
MATT: So we're not barraging the audience.

00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:46.081
SAM: So me talking right now is just wasting
time.

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:47.281
MATT: Yeah, essentially, yeah.

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.985
SAM: Cool, cool cool.

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:52.103
MATT: If you are curious about any merch stuff, we
do have some new merch coming up at GenCon. You

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.920
can go check it out at critrole.com for all the
details.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.045
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:59.574
MATT: We've got some other fun surprises for folks
that are coming, too. Anyway, much love, I think

00:05:59.574 --> 00:06:00.940
it's time--

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.073
LIAM: Oh, so tense.

00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:06.249
MATT: That we dive into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.972
[click, TV static]

00:06:12.397 --> 00:07:23.946
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:40.138
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off,
The Mighty Nein, who had acquired two new allies

00:07:40.138 --> 00:07:47.633
in Keg, the dwarven fighter, and Nila, the firbolg
druid, had made their way to the city of

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:53.277
Shadycreek Run. After making your way through the
town, spending an evening staying at the

00:07:53.277 --> 00:08:00.225
Landlocked Lady, and getting some information
about where to find info about your quarry, and

00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:04.487
where your friends may have been taken to after
they were captured by the Iron Shepherds, a

00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:06.884
traveling slavers crew.

00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:08.723
SAM: They're the worst.

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:18.689
MATT: They are the worst. You went and had a
discussion at the Estate Sybaritic with Ophelia

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:25.198
Mardun, of whom you were sent by The Gentleman to
interface with and do a deed for her a little over

00:08:25.198 --> 00:08:32.371
two weeks ago. There it seemed that the intent of
your job placed here in this city has aligned with

00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:36.462
your current goal of freeing your friends and
seeking vengeance against the Iron Shepherds, as

00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:43.147
they currently work for a competitive family to
the Mardun house, and in response to them

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:49.876
destroying parts of the trade route that the
Mardun family enjoys through the center and

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:56.218
southern sides of the empire, they wish you to
instill damage upon their traders as well, by

00:08:56.218 --> 00:09:02.953
eliminating the Iron Shepherds. You were given
some ideas as to where you might find some help,

00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:10.326
you gathered your things, made your way north into
the seemingly corrupted and haunted Savalierwood,

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:18.575
to seek information about these Iron Shepherds and
where they are. You narrowly avoided two large,

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:29.972
immensely mutated, bone-spurred bear creatures.
You sought out and cased the exterior of the Sour

00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:36.417
Nest, which is the fortress that was given to the
Iron Shepherds by the family that pays them and

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:43.285
keeps them in their employ. You decided to send
your new druid friend, Nila, in the form of a

00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:52.826
small mouse, over the wall, delivery via owl. She
snuck through some portions of the fortress to

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:58.769
gather intel, and to get an idea of where you were
going and what may reside within. A few close

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:06.143
calls, and some discovery of what can be expected
within the interior, you made your way back,

00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:09.488
safely, to join your friends.

00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:12.548
ASHLY: I forgot about the baby. (sigh)

00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:13.927
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:16.393
ASHLY: Sorry, the meal that Lorenzo was having.

00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:17.542
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:17.542 --> 00:10:20.206
ASHLY: Sorry. That just occurred to me.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:28.207
MATT: Upon accidentally spooking one of the outer
guards who were walking the perimeter of the wall

00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:32.790
that surrounds the Sour Nest, you immediately
picked up what you had, fled south, back through

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:39.813
the Savalierwood, on your way to Shadycreek Run to
look for means of possibly finding more help for

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:46.211
this endeavor when nightfall hits, and whatever
else you can do to prepare for the necessary

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:54.529
evacuation of your allies. And that's where we
left off. Mighty Nein, as you've charged back

00:10:54.529 --> 00:11:01.702
through the purplish-gray corrupted Savalierwood,
the midday sun barely visible through slight

00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:07.109
peaking cracks through the canopy above you,
leaping and hearing these large growling sounds

00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:12.243
and hoots, you beeline it as best you can, and as
quickly as you can, before you breach into the

00:11:12.243 --> 00:11:17.536
outskirts of the northern side of the North Clover
area. You're now between some of the nearby

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:21.676
buildings, and you immediately begin to see some
of the relatively shady denizens of this north

00:11:21.676 --> 00:11:26.496
side of Shadycreek Run that glance over their
shoulder, their hooded selves watching you as you

00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:32.093
pass. You slow your gait, as you are no longer
fleeing, per se, but you have made your way back

00:11:32.093 --> 00:11:34.028
to the town. What would you like to do?

00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:35.669
SAM: What time is it?

00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:39.047
MATT: At this point it would be midday, a little
bit in the afternoon.

00:11:39.047 --> 00:11:51.029
SAM: Okay. Oh god! It's midday! What do we do?

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:53.962
ASHLY: We're trying to gather allies right?

00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:54.919
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.531
ASHLY: That's the plan.

00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.001
LIAM: Yeah, and we don't have all the time in the
world because we are trying to intervene before

00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:03.074
the worst happens.

00:12:03.074 --> 00:12:09.121
MARISHA: We mentioned about going and looking to
see if a Tasker would be up to it. There were the

00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:16.231
Taskers, and there were the other group of hired
workers.

00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:21.100
MATT: Yes, The Grunge Gang-- The Grudge Gang,
which the Taskers are a part of it.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.302
SAM: Wait, is is Grudge or Grunge?

00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:23.501
MATT: Grudge.

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.568
SAM: Can I just say Grunge is better name?

00:12:26.568 --> 00:12:36.339
MARISHA: Is it like, the Grudge Gang is an
umbrella corporation of the Taskers, or vice versa?

00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:41.822
MATT: Vice versa. The Grudge Gang is the
overarching, loose network of mercenaries that

00:12:41.822 --> 00:12:49.158
sell swords and do not affiliate directly with any
of the other political powers. They're all just

00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:55.144
outside of the system within the town. The Taskers
are a small subsect of the Grudge Gang that have

00:12:55.144 --> 00:12:58.477
taken it upon themselves to keep the peace to a
certain extent.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:05.217
LIAM: Do we get a sense of the Taskers, are they
just a group, like us? Like a small group, or we

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:06.861
don't know yet?

00:13:06.861 --> 00:13:11.740
MATT: Well, you don't know. You've had some
experience here. The Taskers, best that you can

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.792
surmise, you haven't had a lot of dealings with
them, they are probably in the neighborhood of 30

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:23.718
to 35 people. They are not a massive group by any
means, and they're stretched a little thin, but

00:13:23.718 --> 00:13:27.943
because a lot of them have friends within the
Grudge Gang, and people they've worked with

00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:31.660
before, they can usually call upon friends if need
be, especially if they have some coin to their

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.761
side and they have a specific endeavor they need
to do.

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:37.449
ASHLY: Well?

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:41.215
SAM: Do you think we should go talk one, chat one
up?

00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:45.250
ASHLY: It seems like the best option to me. I'm
not sure who else we could turn to.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:50.490
MARISHA: I mean, just to play devil's advocate
here, is it an issue if we get a hired mercenary

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:56.446
group to kill another underground faction in their
same town? Is that--

00:13:56.446 --> 00:13:59.261
ASHLY: Could it trace back to Ophelia, is that
what you are saying?

00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:03.343
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know, it's a weird
political issue, hiring someone in the system.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:09.879
SAM: Maybe before we go randomly hiring people:
what do we need to make this attack? We can

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:16.849
probably get in. Also, we're not attacking, right?
We're just going to go and try to rescue, or maybe

00:14:16.849 --> 00:14:23.853
pick off one or two of them, or smoke them out, so
that the prisoners, or whatever, have to leave and

00:14:23.853 --> 00:14:27.603
we can rescue, right? We're not trying to kill
everyone in the motherfucking house, right?

00:14:27.603 --> 00:14:31.504
MARISHA: Well this Ophelia wants us to kill
everyone in the motherfucking house.

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.097
SAM: Well I just want to get our people out.

00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:36.537
LIAM: Then we are not fulfilling our
responsibilities.

00:14:36.537 --> 00:14:39.695
SUMALEE: It will be impossible to save our friends
without killing them.

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:41.657
MARISHA: I think she's right.

00:14:41.657 --> 00:14:47.648
LIAM: We go at night, and the first step is taking
care of the two, there could be more, but two that

00:14:47.648 --> 00:14:53.902
we saw on the wall, whoever is on the wall at
night, silently. Then, from all you've told us, we

00:14:53.902 --> 00:15:04.358
have-- this might be incomplete information-- but
three. There is the shithead himself, and then two you saw.

00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:06.080
SUMALEE: At least two eating.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.995
LIAM: So three total that we know about.

00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:11.275
SUMALEE: But there were many more beds.

00:15:11.275 --> 00:15:14.745
MARISHA: Plus, who knows who could arrive in the
time that we're gone.

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:16.571
LIAM: That is also correct.

00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:18.687
MARISHA: I think we need to be prepared for all of
them.

00:15:18.687 --> 00:15:26.723
SAM: But are we going to hire muscle, or magic, or
what are we trying to get? What helps us?

00:15:26.723 --> 00:15:29.416
MARISHA: I miss Jester's healing spells.

00:15:29.416 --> 00:15:34.668
SAM: Maybe there's a place to buy some potions.

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:41.641
ASHLY: Well it seems like-- I mean, I'm not the
stealthiest person. It seems like having more

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:45.299
numbers is a good thing. I don't know if we could
create a distraction of some kind, lead some of

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:47.025
them away. I don't know.

00:15:47.025 --> 00:15:49.380
SUMALEE: I can do that. I'm good at that.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.373
ASHLY: Diversions?

00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:51.494
SUMALEE: Yes.

00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:54.503
ASHLY: You're very excited about this, Nila.

00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:59.332
SUMALEE: I want to get in there as fast as we
can.

00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:04.234
MARISHA: I mean, look. The solution might end up
solving itself, who know who in this town is even

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:06.366
willing to go up against the Iron Shepherds.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.761
ASHLY: Wait, would I know--

00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:08.823
SAM: Wait.

00:16:08.823 --> 00:16:14.150
LIAM, ASHLY, MARISHA and MATT: Wait.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.648
ASHLY: The place where they keep the prisoners is
underground?

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:22.179
MATT: Correct.

00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:26.463
ASHLY: Could we just burn down the building? Burn
down the motherfucking house?

00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:28.868
MATT: It's mostly stone.

00:16:28.868 --> 00:16:30.969
ASHLY: Burn down the-- is there wood in there?

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:35.051
MATT: There's elements of wood from a decoration
standpoint, but for the most part, it's a stone structure.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.402
SAM: We could bring in a lot of kindling.

00:16:38.402 --> 00:16:45.242
MARISHA: Smoke them out! That's actually not a bad
idea, now that I think about it, though.

00:16:45.242 --> 00:16:52.346
LIAM: When you were in this house, as a mouse,
there was no way down there. It was a solid trap

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:55.382
door. You don't know what was under it?

00:16:55.382 --> 00:16:59.218
SUMALEE: I could hear them, but that's the only
thing that I could see.

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:02.939
LIAM: What did you hear, specifically?

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:15.353
SUMALEE: I heard voices, I remember that. I was
trying to listen for my partner and my son. I know

00:17:15.353 --> 00:17:24.931
they were the voices of the captured people, the
prisoners. I believe I heard voices as well of

00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:28.487
some of the murderers.

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:35.999
LIAM: Well, we need to peel this like an onion. We
need to, I believe, get some help. Get some

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:42.762
reassurance. Outer layer of the onion is making
sure we take whoever is on the walls, whoever is

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:49.184
keeping watch, out, silently, so that we can begin
anew with the building itself. I think that either

00:17:49.184 --> 00:17:57.380
you or my friend here should go in ahead of us so
we have some idea of what is happening. Once in a

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.900
while I turn this one into a spider. It is slow,
but it is very undetectable.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.491
MARISHA: (laughing)

00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:08.600
LIAM: Do you feel differently?

00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:18.672
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm just imagining an infiltration
with the spider, like that's feasible.

00:18:18.672 --> 00:18:21.380
SAM: Tip of the spear!

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.899
MARISHA: Go, Frumpkin, go!

00:18:22.899 --> 00:18:26.735
ASHLY: Get him! Now bite him!

00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:31.258
MATT: Lorenzo, felled by a brown recluse!

00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:33.843
MARISHA: Put him in his boot!

00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:39.038
LIAM: Truthfully, there are ways that I can hurt
people with a spider, but I'm just talking about

00:18:39.038 --> 00:18:43.753
having a look around so that we are not walking
into something different than what you saw last night.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:48.795
MARISHA: Sure. Literally anything is better than a
spider, though. For that. I just want to point that out.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.824
LIAM: Well, I disagree with you.

00:18:50.824 --> 00:18:54.678
MARISHA: I mean they've got a lot of eyes, I get
that, but I think in terms of a movement

00:18:54.678 --> 00:18:59.322
situation, spiders aren't the best.

00:18:59.322 --> 00:19:02.031
LIAM: Agree to disagree.

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:07.246
ASHLY: Do you guys need a second, should we take a
smoke break?

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:13.244
LIAM: You are new. This is very typical. It's just
part of the group dynamic. We are all friends.

00:19:13.244 --> 00:19:19.207
SAM: It's like, have you ever seen a debate team?
They pick one side, and the other, and then they

00:19:19.207 --> 00:19:21.314
just go at it for a while.

00:19:21.314 --> 00:19:26.339
ASHLY: There's no really debating in Shadycreek
Run. Mostly insult, kill, insult, kill.

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.436
SAM: They should really start a debate club.

00:19:28.436 --> 00:19:30.774
ASHLY: We should really start the first one!

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:33.278
LIAM: I am a master debater.

00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:36.150
ASHLY: Shadycreek Debaters? Side mission.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.707
MARISHA: Shady Debaters!

00:19:37.707 --> 00:19:45.702
ASHLY: Shady Debaters? That's all I care about
now.

00:19:45.702 --> 00:19:47.707
MATT: Well that's our next merch piece there.

00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:51.251
MARISHA: Laura, make a Shady Debaters debate team
shirt!

00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:53.375
MATT: Nope!

00:19:53.375 --> 00:20:01.439
LIAM: But we want to take numbers down, so we peel
the outer layer separately. If all goes well, then

00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:06.742
there is whoever is upstairs. The big X factor is
what is what is beneath. We don't know how many

00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:08.806
people are underneath.

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:15.652
SAM: You said the sleeping quarters are upstairs.
If we went in the dead of night, and I know you

00:20:15.652 --> 00:20:22.105
have a spell that can lock a door, or shut a door
or something?

00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:29.251
LIAM: If I can find materials in Shadycreek. I
need gold dust, a lot of gold dust. How likely is

00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:30.897
that here?

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.370
ASHLY: Would I know where to find that? Would that
be the general store, would that have that?

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.973
MATT: They may have it there, yeah. You haven't
had to acquire gold dust before, but if you were

00:20:37.973 --> 00:20:41.728
to ask around, you could see if there's some place
in the vicinity that might carry it.

00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:46.398
LIAM: To first get gold dust, I would need gold.

00:20:46.398 --> 00:20:49.147
ASHLY: Which we would also need to hire people.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.378
SAM: We have some.

00:20:50.378 --> 00:20:52.849
LIAM: How much do we have? I have next to
nothing.

00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:56.622
ASHLY: I have 130.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.728
SUMALEE: I have ten gold pieces.

00:20:58.728 --> 00:21:00.007
SAM: Did you say ten?

00:21:00.007 --> 00:21:00.852
SUMALEE: Ten.

00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:01.797
SAM: Oh wow.

00:21:01.797 --> 00:21:03.542
SUMALEE: I am happy to contribute that.

00:21:03.542 --> 00:21:05.753
ASHLY: Is it 130 gold? Or is it silver that I
have?

00:21:05.753 --> 00:21:06.897
MATT: 130 gold.

00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:09.395
LIAM: What about in the haversack? Does Jester
have any funds in there?

00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:16.786
SAM: Oh. That's a good question. I'll reach in and
see what she has.

00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:19.238
MARISHA: I've got a little bit of funds.

00:21:19.238 --> 00:21:22.247
LIAM: Text thread explodes in five, four, three.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:26.351
SAM: I need my thing? Where's the currency in
here?

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.866
MARISHA: If you go under equipment--

00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:30.745
ASHLY: You don't remember your handy acronym?

00:21:30.745 --> 00:21:33.542
SAM: I need it written down! Oh there it is.

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.960
LIAM: Remember, "LIAM EATS FARTS."

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:42.798
SAM: "LIAM EATS FARTS!" That's right, it's right
here. I have a few hundred gold.

00:21:42.798 --> 00:21:45.197
MARISHA: Same.

00:21:45.197 --> 00:21:52.151
ASHLY: Maybe we need people on the outside to take
care of folks on watch. The onion you're talking

00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:56.769
about, maybe the outer layers are the hired hands,
and then we're the ones who go in.

00:21:56.769 --> 00:22:01.659
LIAM: Yeah, it could be a group effort. I feel
very confident for many of our skills for the ones

00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:06.438
on the outside. What I'm concerned about is
entering the front door. What is behind? What I

00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:13.042
would like to do is go when they are sleeping and
hopefully murder them in their sleep, is the best case.

00:22:13.263 --> 00:22:18.257
SUMALEE: Why don't we call them out, then? Why
don't we make them come outside? We have more

00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:21.509
abilities outside.

00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:24.475
SAM: But then they'll have weapons.

00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:29.593
LIAM: Yeah, the thing when someone is sleeping in
a bed is they are like little-- (whispering) I was

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:31.803
going to say babies. I shouldn't say that!

00:22:31.803 --> 00:22:33.504
SAM: Don't say that to her, especially.

00:22:33.504 --> 00:22:37.453
SUMALEE: I cannot use my lightning inside. That is
all I'm saying.

00:22:37.453 --> 00:22:43.003
ASHLY: What if we lure one of them out for you to
fry like a chicken?

00:22:43.003 --> 00:22:46.313
SUMALEE: I would be okay with that.

00:22:46.313 --> 00:22:51.424
LIAM: There's a little bit that we have to play
this by ear. I think we should go at night to

00:22:51.424 --> 00:22:58.404
handle things when it is the least busy.

00:22:58.404 --> 00:23:00.459
ASHLY: Is there anything we're missing?

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:06.183
SAM: We have no way of healing ourselves if we
die, unless you have healing potions on you.

00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:08.069
LIAM: Well, maybe we can find some in Shadycreek.

00:23:08.069 --> 00:23:12.323
ASHLY: I have two potions of greater healing.

00:23:12.323 --> 00:23:14.375
SAM: How many do we all have? She has two.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:15.434
MARISHA: I have one.

00:23:15.434 --> 00:23:16.366
LIAM: One.

00:23:16.366 --> 00:23:17.225
SUMALEE: Of what?

00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:18.468
MARISHA: Healing potions.

00:23:18.468 --> 00:23:20.673
SUMALEE: I have Healing Words.

00:23:20.673 --> 00:23:23.163
SAM, ASHLY, and MARISHA: Ooh!

00:23:23.163 --> 00:23:24.136
SUMALEE: Does that help?

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.080
MARISHA: That does help!

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.985
SUMALEE: Excellent! And I have those Goodberries!

00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:33.072
MARISHA: Those are good! Those are great!

00:23:33.072 --> 00:23:47.440
SUMALEE: And I can help give us extra power. In my
clan, we have a bear spirit known as Oaktar. If I

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.740
invoke the spirit of Oaktar, it gives us each
extra power.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.242
ASHLY: Your clan sounds awesome.

00:23:56.242 --> 00:23:58.969
SAM: Do I have to go to church or anything?

00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:05.577
SUMALEE: No, you just have to be-- I think it's
within 30 feet of where I put the spirit totem.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:08.591
LIAM: That seems strangely specific.

00:24:08.591 --> 00:24:11.646
MARISHA: I'm into it, yeah.

00:24:11.646 --> 00:24:19.185
ASHLY: So to Nott's point, what do we need? We
need fighters, we need magic? What do we need?

00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:25.257
MARISHA: I like the idea of getting some sort of
fighter, especially if Nila can maybe take out

00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:32.926
that outer onion layer with the lightning. We
should have found a better analogy.

00:24:32.926 --> 00:24:37.370
LIAM: Than an onion? Well, how about we're just
going to kill the people on the wall, how is that

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.895
for a metaphor?

00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.313
MARISHA: I like that.

00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:45.144
LIAM: I like the idea of someone with a little bit
of muscle and then another person who is adept at

00:24:45.144 --> 00:24:48.539
healing injuries.

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:58.729
SAM: Well, we did hear about that weird-- someone
said that there's some priest or something, or cleric?

00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:01.075
LIAM: In the woods.

00:25:01.075 --> 00:25:02.602
MARISHA: Ophelia mentioned that, yeah.

00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:06.578
SAM: Yeah, so we could go see if they could give
us--

00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:07.696
MARISHA: Aid.

00:25:07.696 --> 00:25:09.146
SAM: Or come along?

00:25:09.146 --> 00:25:11.857
LIAM: Did Ophelia mention how far out into the
woods that person was?

00:25:11.857 --> 00:25:17.268
MATT: Travel on foot is about roughly four to six
hours depending on how well you can make your way

00:25:17.268 --> 00:25:19.165
through the terrain.

00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:20.690
LIAM: It is the same day?

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.696
MATT: It's like two in the afternoon, yeah.

00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:24.462
SAM: So we can make it tonight.

00:25:24.462 --> 00:25:27.850
MARISHA: I oddly trust that more than hiring
someone from The Grudge Gang.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.053
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> that is a good point.

00:25:31.053 --> 00:25:36.251
MARISHA: I feel like The Grudge Gang might have
ties to the Iron Shepherds or at least an inside man.

00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:39.021
LIAM: Yeah, friendsies.

00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:42.816
ASHLY: I mean we could try, but if all they are is
a healer--

00:25:42.816 --> 00:25:50.262
SAM: That would be amazing, though. I mean healing
potions are nice, but we need someone who can-- we

00:25:50.262 --> 00:25:53.287
get killed a lot or nearly, you know?

00:25:53.287 --> 00:25:54.111
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:57.613
MARISHA: I've seen some pretty badass priests in
my day.

00:25:57.613 --> 00:25:59.435
ASHLY: Do I have any sense of--

00:25:59.435 --> 00:26:00.660
SAM: You have?

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.023
ASHLY: She mentioned some of the kooky ones out in
the woods, right?

00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:07.267
MATT: Yeah, she mentioned a Blooming Grove.

00:26:07.267 --> 00:26:09.110
ASHLY: Do I have any sense of what that is?

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:14.114
MATT: You've not necessarily heard of The Blooming
Grove. Roll a history check, actually.

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:17.911
ASHLY: This not going to go well. 12.

00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:22.661
MATT: That's not too bad. You've vaguely heard of
The Blooming Grove, but it's not referred to that

00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:25.709
very often. It's more referred to do as The Bone
Orchard.

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.911
ASHLY: Hmm, less fun.

00:26:27.911 --> 00:26:35.618
MATT: Yeah, you haven't been there, but from what
you know, it's this strange, ancient gravesite

00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:45.420
that's been on the outskirts of town, a few miles
out, since before the town was built.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.186
ASHLY: Are these healers considered by people in
Shadycreek Run to be wackadoos? Or are they--

00:26:50.186 --> 00:26:55.562
MATT: From what you know, from what you've heard,
everyone thinks they're strange, creepy hermits

00:26:55.562 --> 00:27:02.806
and possibly witches. No one really goes there.
Some folk in here tend to put on the air of not

00:27:02.806 --> 00:27:09.375
being superstitious, but the Savalierwood carries
a lot of superstition with it. Some folks, while

00:27:09.375 --> 00:27:13.408
they may play it off, still seem to get a little
nervous about delving too deep into it.

00:27:13.408 --> 00:27:20.021
ASHLY: Well, that is a good point. If this person
lives in the Savalierwoods, then they're not weak.

00:27:20.021 --> 00:27:25.649
There's a lot of crazy shit in the woods, so they
must be able to hold their own, or at least remain discrete.

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:32.208
SAM: They don't belong to any pact, or group that
we would need to negotiate with?

00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:36.143
ASHLY: No, they live outside the-- I mean, they're
not even really related to the clans.

00:27:36.143 --> 00:27:40.356
MARISHA: Did we hear what god they worship?

00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:42.830
MATT: You have no idea.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:48.908
MARISHA: I feel like if it was one of the accepted
gods of The Empire, you wouldn't have to hide out

00:27:48.908 --> 00:27:53.508
in the woods. I'm kind of into this idea.

00:27:53.508 --> 00:27:55.788
ASHLY: We can try.

00:27:55.788 --> 00:28:02.261
SAM: Is it worth asking a Tasker first? What would
we even ask? Just how much it would be to hire you

00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:03.905
for some muscle?

00:28:03.905 --> 00:28:10.179
ASHLY: Yeah. They're not affiliated directly. It's
better for them to not be affiliated with any

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:13.370
particular groups, so-- but you know. This is not
a great place.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:18.108
LIAM: Well, we're weighing two things against each
other. One is expediency because there are many

00:28:18.108 --> 00:28:24.128
people in Shadycreek who could possibly lend a
sword or ability. But I think that you are

00:28:24.128 --> 00:28:29.094
correct. That there is no telling their
allegiance, and I'm not ruling them out, but this

00:28:29.094 --> 00:28:33.939
person out in the woods: probably not in the
pocket of our enemies. We need to come to a

00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:35.754
decision promptly.

00:28:35.754 --> 00:28:41.563
ASHLY: Well, how hardy would you say the mental
state of your companions is?

00:28:41.563 --> 00:28:44.108
MARISHA: The ones in captivity?

00:28:44.108 --> 00:28:44.779
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:47.872
SAM: Oh, I thought you meant us, because we're
right here. We can hear you.

00:28:47.872 --> 00:28:50.277
ASHLY: No. I know that.

00:28:50.277 --> 00:28:53.699
MARISHA: Probably pretty unstable.

00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:58.370
ASHLY: What, do you think that they would be
susceptible to torture?

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.605
MARISHA: Being controlled.

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:08.203
SAM: Fjord, probably not. Yasha's probably is
okay. Jester has already turned. She's flipped.

00:29:08.203 --> 00:29:09.940
She's probably flipped.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.209
ASHLY: Oh, then there's no rush.

00:29:11.209 --> 00:29:14.811
LIAM: Or wrapped them around her finger, one way
or the other. No, they are actually pretty--

00:29:14.811 --> 00:29:17.725
they've got their shit together.

00:29:17.725 --> 00:29:21.779
MARISHA: They arguably have their shit together
way more than the three of us do.

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:23.105
ASHLY: Would they look after--

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:25.050
LIAM: A child?

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.707
ASHLY: Yeah.

00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:26.662
LIAM: Yes.

00:29:26.662 --> 00:29:28.188
ASHLY: Okay.

00:29:28.188 --> 00:29:31.165
MARISHA: Yeah, especially Jester.

00:29:31.165 --> 00:29:35.902
ASHLY: Then maybe it's all right to take a little
bit more time.

00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:38.405
LIAM: We have to make a decision.

00:29:38.405 --> 00:29:39.880
MARISHA: What time is it?

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.307
MATT: Pushing past two to three in the afternoon.

00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:44.949
MARISHA: You said it's four hours there.

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.592
MATT: Four to six hours depending on how well you
travel.

00:29:47.592 --> 00:29:48.776
ASHLY: We have our horses?

00:29:48.776 --> 00:29:49.555
SAM: Are we walking or horsing?

00:29:49.555 --> 00:29:52.706
MATT: That's walking. Your horse isn't going to go
any faster than you in the middle of this very

00:29:52.706 --> 00:29:56.310
clustered forest. There's no path that leads to
it.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:01.963
MARISHA: Brisk power walk there, that'll get us
there right around sunset. Talk to people. Power

00:30:01.963 --> 00:30:05.834
walk back, should get us there back--

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:07.521
SAM: For the Tonight Show?

00:30:07.521 --> 00:30:09.155
MARISHA: Yes, in time for Saturday Night Live.

00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:12.173
(laughter)

00:30:12.173 --> 00:30:15.120
ASHLY: Lorenzo loves that show. He'll be up
watching it.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.975
MARISHA: Great.

00:30:15.975 --> 00:30:17.308
ASHLY: We'll change the plan.

00:30:17.308 --> 00:30:18.762
LIAM: (announcer voice) Ophelia Mardun.

00:30:18.762 --> 00:30:22.662
(laughter)

00:30:22.662 --> 00:30:25.457
MARISHA: We might be able to go and get back in
time, is what I'm saying, and still be able to

00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:26.926
attack tonight.

00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:32.092
LIAM: To the household, <i>ja.</i> If we find what we
find in the woods is helpful enough, and we feel

00:30:32.092 --> 00:30:35.004
good with what we got. Then in the middle of the
night is a go.

00:30:35.004 --> 00:30:39.949
MARISHA: If it is a total bust, then that sucks.

00:30:39.949 --> 00:30:42.908
SAM: We can still find a Tasker.

00:30:42.908 --> 00:30:46.104
ASHLY: Yeah, they don't have a bedtime.

00:30:46.104 --> 00:30:47.471
MARISHA: That's true.

00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.067
LIAM: We want to hit it at two or three in the
morning.

00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:54.215
MARISHA: All right, let's go. Are you good with
that, Nila? You seem apprehensive.

00:30:54.215 --> 00:30:57.838
SUMALEE: I could check my smell bag, but I trust
you right now.

00:30:57.838 --> 00:30:58.925
SAM: No, check your smell bag.

00:30:58.925 --> 00:31:03.137
SUMALEE: Oh thank you. It makes me feel so much
better.

00:31:03.137 --> 00:31:04.721
SAM: See if it passes the smell test.

00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:06.767
LIAM: Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:13.892
SUMALEE: This is for going to find the priest who
has special abilities for reviving the dead and

00:31:13.892 --> 00:31:15.635
healing people.

00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:17.661
SAM: (fart noise)

00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:28.352
SUMALEE: Pretty good. Okay, this is for The
Taskers and The Grunge Gang.

00:31:28.352 --> 00:31:30.933
ASHLY: She took your name for it.

00:31:30.933 --> 00:31:33.367
SAM: Oh, it's a better name.

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:34.478
SUMALEE: Did I mistake it?

00:31:34.478 --> 00:31:37.125
ASHLY and SAM: No, no.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:38.879
ASHLY: That's perfect. Smell your bag.

00:31:38.879 --> 00:31:54.110
SUMALEE: It smells salty. Salty versus a little
bit of a raw, but grounded spicy flavor. I like

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.879
that one. Let us go see the priest. Thank you,
smell bag.

00:32:01.192 --> 00:32:02.822
LIAM: You cannot argue with that.

00:32:02.822 --> 00:32:07.921
SAM: No. You cannot argue with someone who talks
to a smell bag.

00:32:07.921 --> 00:32:09.283
ASHLY: That is accurate.

00:32:09.283 --> 00:32:13.470
SUMALEE: It has given me so much comfort over many
years. I love it. Thank you.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.207
SAM: Sure.

00:32:16.207 --> 00:32:18.651
MARISHA: Well, shall we?

00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:20.279
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:22.392
ASHLY and MARISHA: Let's power walk.

00:32:22.392 --> 00:32:23.847
MATT: All right.

00:32:23.847 --> 00:32:25.794
SAM: Butt-cheeks clenched.

00:32:25.794 --> 00:32:27.384
ASHLY: What's the one where you wiggle? Is that
power walking?

00:32:27.384 --> 00:32:28.505
SAM: Speed walking.

00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:32.955
MARISHA: You know like grandmas in malls, like
around Christmas time.

00:32:32.955 --> 00:32:35.026
LIAM: Are we Prancercising?

00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:37.007
MATT: Everyone has their Fitbits attuned?

00:32:37.007 --> 00:32:38.102
MARISHA: Yes.

00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:40.915
MATT: First off, what's your marching order,
please?

00:32:40.915 --> 00:32:42.890
LIAM: Oh, also are our horses dead?

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:48.241
SAM: No, we can take the horses. It wouldn't speed
us up, but at least we'd be on horses.

00:32:48.241 --> 00:32:49.358
MATT: You can take them with you.

00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:50.924
LIAM: But it wouldn't speed us up, because it's
the woods?

00:32:50.924 --> 00:32:51.946
MATT: Because it's like a thick wood.

00:32:51.946 --> 00:32:52.774
LIAM: Let's walk.

00:32:52.774 --> 00:32:55.824
MATT: Okay. Who's up front? Who's in the back?
Who's guiding what?

00:32:55.824 --> 00:32:59.991
ASHLY: Would I know better, potentially, where I'm
going? Should I be in front? Or have I never been to this?

00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.541
MATT: It depends. Whoever wants to guide this will
be taking the survival checks to lead you through.

00:33:04.541 --> 00:33:06.705
So who wants to be making--

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:09.849
SAM: Nila, you seem to know about the woods. No?

00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:12.736
SUMALEE: I would be happy to. Oh yes, survival is
good for me.

00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:14.932
LIAM: I will walk just behind Nila.

00:33:15.398 --> 00:33:17.271
MAT: Okay, so Nila's helming that.

00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:19.719
SUMALEE: You are relying on me. I'm very happy.

00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:22.532
ASHLY: Aww.

00:33:22.532 --> 00:33:26.345
LIAM: She's just the biggest. I'm going to stand
next to the biggest person.

00:33:26.345 --> 00:33:27.499
MATT: That's a good call.

00:33:27.499 --> 00:33:28.631
MARISHA: That's still reliance.

00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:30.294
MATT: Who's behind or near Caleb?

00:33:30.294 --> 00:33:30.673
ASHLY: I'll take up the back.

00:33:30.673 --> 00:33:35.568
MATT: All right, so Keg's holding up the back.
Beau in the middle?

00:33:35.568 --> 00:33:36.974
MARISHA: Nott, do you want the middle?

00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:38.034
SAM: Yes, please.

00:33:38.034 --> 00:33:42.126
MATT: There you go. I'll put Frumpkin there, next
to-- okay.

00:33:42.126 --> 00:33:43.500
MARISHA: Fuh-wumpkin.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:52.300
MATT: Taking this moment now, you begin to head
back away from Shadycreek, and helming this group

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:59.783
of ragtag adventures you've under your wing. You
tread into an area of the Savalierwood you've not

00:33:59.783 --> 00:34:05.982
traveled before hoping that your instincts, your
smell bag, and the spirit of what nature has

00:34:05.982 --> 00:34:11.569
managed to maintain itself through this corrupted
wood could guide you properly to your destination.

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:14.549
I need you to make a survival check, please.

00:34:14.549 --> 00:34:17.255
ASHLY: She is superstitiously leading us around,
just smelling.

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:18.734
LIAM: Get it girl.

00:34:18.734 --> 00:34:20.259
SUMALEE: Oh.

00:34:20.259 --> 00:34:21.850
MARISHA: That was almost great.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:22.898
LIAM: Is there anything to add to-- ooh.

00:34:22.898 --> 00:34:23.661
SUMALEE: Ten.

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:27.879
MATT: Ten, okay. You still have your Luck feat if
you want to, unless you want to save it.

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:28.828
SUMALEE: Oh, yes.

00:34:28.828 --> 00:34:30.771
MATT: You have two more points left.

00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:35.807
SUMALEE: I think we should use it. Yes. I would
like to use one Luck point.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.029
MATT: One more Luck point.

00:34:38.029 --> 00:34:43.381
SUMALEE: 17 plus seven. 24.

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:45.209
MATT: 24, okay!

00:34:45.209 --> 00:34:48.338
SUMALEE: We shall survive.

00:34:48.338 --> 00:34:54.785
MATT: Not only do you swiftly manage to find the
portions of the wooded paths that are least

00:34:54.785 --> 00:35:04.265
blockaded by thorny brambles and fallen
half-rotted trees, but you also manage to help the

00:35:04.265 --> 00:35:15.749
party avoid a few small openings that look
uniquely and uncomfortably welcoming. In the midst

00:35:15.749 --> 00:35:21.763
of a wood like this, you know from your experience
as well, that it is not always a good idea to step

00:35:21.763 --> 00:35:27.596
where it seems most inviting, when you know the
wood around you to be less so.

00:35:28.058 --> 00:35:30.136
MARISHA: (whispering) Yes, yes.

00:35:30.136 --> 00:35:39.224
MATT: As you crest around the second of these open
groves, you notice how the ground itself seems to

00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:46.947
shift slightly, and you watch as for a moment it
seems to almost pit as elements of the dirt suck

00:35:46.947 --> 00:35:55.920
inward. You know the antlion funnels that appear
in the sand and begins to come in towards them.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.166
The ground almost seems to sink in for a second
before righting itself. The grove stands flat once

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:11.198
more, but thankfully, due to the survival
instincts of your firbolg leader, you manage to

00:36:11.198 --> 00:36:18.076
careen past two of these patches without issue.
Pushing on at a fairly intense speed, within three

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:20.475
and a half hours, not even the full four--

00:36:20.475 --> 00:36:22.246
ASHLY: Hey!

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:29.534
MATT: You manage to make your way to an area where
the color notably changes ahead of you. The

00:36:29.534 --> 00:36:39.511
somewhat still purple-gray color that suffuses
most of the natural landscape within the

00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:49.161
Savalierwood, gives way to a patch of green in the
distance. This is the first sign that calls forth

00:36:49.161 --> 00:36:56.175
that warm sensation you got when you had checked
this path within your smell bag. As the rest of

00:36:56.175 --> 00:37:06.591
you begin to gather up behind Nila, the closer you
get you begin to watch as these winter trees, that

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:22.124
comprise most of this northern forest, give way to
green oaks and swamp-based plant life. The

00:37:22.124 --> 00:37:27.795
temperature, as you get to a certain threshold,
begins to be not quite as biting cold, slightly

00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:34.496
warmer with each step. Looking around immediately,
the first thing that catches your eye is this

00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:42.768
large wall of tangled vine and thorns. The same
purplish-gray color. The green is still ahead of

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:49.598
you. Do you guys want to continue on? Anything you
want to do?

00:37:49.598 --> 00:37:50.927
ASHLY: You said there's a wall of thorns?

00:37:50.927 --> 00:37:54.439
MATT: It looks like a natural wall that curls up
about five or so feet.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:55.926
ASHLY: In our way.

00:37:55.926 --> 00:37:57.561
MATT: In your way, yes.

00:37:57.561 --> 00:38:01.948
SAM: How far to the sides does it go? As far as
the eye can see?

00:38:01.948 --> 00:38:04.752
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:38:06.054 --> 00:38:12.405
SAM: That's sort of cocked. I'll take it anyway.
11 plus nothing.

00:38:12.405 --> 00:38:22.291
MATT: A little ways off it seems to dip a bit.
Maybe about 100 feet or so to the northern side of

00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:26.676
it. You've been traveling northwest to reach this
part of the forest.

00:38:26.676 --> 00:38:28.542
MARISHA: We can't see over the wall?

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:33.901
MATT: You can see over it a bit, as there's only
about five or so feet most places. As you get a

00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:38.846
little bit closer, you can see areas where these
tangle of vines are pulled apart or have entirely

00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:48.762
enclosed, and you see long-rusted, wrought iron
bars, a fence of some kind. A boundary that was

00:38:48.762 --> 00:38:54.526
placed long ago, that has since been slowly taken
back by nature. You then begin to see that area of

00:38:54.526 --> 00:38:58.050
the wall that you had noticed, Nott, that had
seemed to be bending, and the vines have actually

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:06.297
curled over and bent it downward. It seems that
whatever this little section of the forest is--

00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:13.544
whatever protective magics that once contained
this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the

00:39:13.544 --> 00:39:16.992
corruption of the Savalierwood.

00:39:16.992 --> 00:39:19.890
SAM: Should we hop the fence?

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:27.338
LIAM: One moment. I send Frumpkin up to flit about
50 feet ahead to see if there is anything ahead,

00:39:27.338 --> 00:39:30.630
or from a bird's eye view that we are unable to
detect.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:35.236
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for Frumpkin
with advantage because it is still in the owl form.

00:39:41.053 --> 00:39:45.977
LIAM: That is a 21.

00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:56.388
MATT: Frumpkin darts up, jumping from tree edge to
tree edge, gliding through. There are numerous

00:39:56.388 --> 00:40:03.855
layers of similar walls. Three different layers,
looks like. Whereas the outskirts or the perimeter

00:40:03.855 --> 00:40:15.404
of this beautiful, protected, ancient gravesite
that once held this corruption at bay has slowly

00:40:15.404 --> 00:40:23.533
collapsed inward, and a new boundary is placed.
Then that boundary has fallen. As the corruption

00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:29.264
pulls in further, a new boundary is built. That
third boundary now seems to be in the process of

00:40:29.264 --> 00:40:39.859
giving in, just like its previous constructs.
Within this third area, you can see not just a

00:40:39.859 --> 00:40:48.086
lack of snow, or ice, or the winter chill, but a
nearly humid summer warmth, something more akin to

00:40:48.086 --> 00:40:55.282
the southern tip of the Empire or even Menagerie
Coast. It is an unexpected and extreme shift in

00:40:55.282 --> 00:41:03.393
temperature and weather. There is something
unnatural, or at least magical, that maintains

00:41:03.393 --> 00:41:18.063
this little pocket of untouched paradise. There
you can see small pools, bits of bog where the

00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:30.841
soft green and browns of compost fall into green,
thick, algae-covered bits of water. You can see

00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:40.545
dozens and dozens of stone tablets, about a foot
to two feet high, with bits of script across them,

00:41:40.545 --> 00:41:48.474
too far to see, that have partially fallen or
leaning. At which point Frumpkin looks around and

00:41:48.474 --> 00:41:54.519
this entire area, from the outer very edge where
that first perimeter wall was found, to the inside

00:41:54.519 --> 00:42:01.517
has all been graves, most taken back by the
Savalierwood as it slowly crushes whatever this

00:42:01.517 --> 00:42:12.597
location is at its source. On the far end, towards
the core and the back-- the northern side of this

00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:23.654
final, defending pocket of uncorrupted forest--
you can see a stone building, maybe 20 by 30 feet,

00:42:23.654 --> 00:42:33.684
built as an old stone steeple. It stands
windowless, open, and the floor of it to each open

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:38.098
window overgrown with green vine and leaf.

00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:43.608
LIAM: Frumpkin is how far from me at this point?

00:42:43.608 --> 00:42:47.942
MATT: Frumpkin is about 100 to 150 feet from you.

00:42:47.942 --> 00:42:53.693
LIAM: So I can only watch. I have muttered all
this, watching. We are talking concentric rings?

00:42:53.693 --> 00:42:55.851
MATT: Yeah.

00:42:55.851 --> 00:43:00.577
MARISHA: I think this is the place.

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:06.567
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

00:43:06.567 --> 00:43:14.425
MATT: Frumpkin begins to return, and a passing of
one of the clouds gives more sunlight that breaks

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:22.576
through what was previously a very dense, gray
sky. As the light passes between the small breaks

00:43:22.576 --> 00:43:30.254
in the tree canopies, the green comes to light
with color, numerous types of color. A rainbow of

00:43:30.254 --> 00:43:39.793
flowers, of pigments you've never really seen
before, begin to emerge as the light hits it.

00:43:39.793 --> 00:43:50.034
Nearly every inch of these gravesites contain a
smattering scatter of rainbow colors across petal

00:43:50.034 --> 00:43:52.720
and stamen.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.916
LIAM: I am beginning to think this a little more
than we came looking for, but we have traveled a ways.

00:44:01.252 --> 00:44:07.545
SAM: Is there any sign of life? I mean, other than
plant life?

00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:13.619
MATT: You saw maybe a few frogs, small natural
creatures that exist within this space, but

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:20.318
nothing that would resemble a human yet. It seems
still.

00:44:20.318 --> 00:44:25.799
SAM and ASHLY: Let's go in.

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:31.036
SAM: How do we get over these things? Could we
climb them or would we get cut to shreds?

00:44:31.036 --> 00:44:32.503
MATT: You can certainly try.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.612
ASHLY: How tall are the gates?

00:44:34.612 --> 00:44:40.338
MATT: The areas where the fence has been pushed in
is between five to six feet in places, areas where

00:44:40.338 --> 00:44:45.733
it seems to be pushed down lower to about four to
even three and a half.

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:51.556
ASHLY: Your friend's coat? I know it's maybe
not--

00:44:51.556 --> 00:44:53.200
SAM: You mean the tapestry?

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.625
ASHLY: The tapestry. I know it might hurt it, but
if we drape it over--

00:44:57.625 --> 00:44:59.027
MARISHA: We buried him with it.

00:44:59.027 --> 00:44:59.961
ASHLY: Oh, that's right.

00:44:59.961 --> 00:45:02.761
MARISHA: But that's a good idea.

00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:11.931
ASHLY: You want to go back? I could try to hack at
it with my axe.

00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:13.522
SUMALEE: Could an animal jump over it?

00:45:13.522 --> 00:45:21.851
MATT: Yeah. You guys could attempt to climb and
leap over. Elements of it are thorned and jagged.

00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:29.529
MARISHA: This is what I used to do to hop fences
back in the day. I look for a few broken-down

00:45:29.529 --> 00:45:32.135
branches that might be my height.

00:45:32.135 --> 00:45:33.804
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:45:33.804 --> 00:45:35.660
MARISHA: A handful.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.177
LIAM: We are going on a witch hunt. We can't go
over it, we can't go under it.

00:45:42.177 --> 00:45:44.176
MARISHA: Ten.

00:45:44.445 --> 00:45:49.439
MATT: That's fair. It takes you a few minutes and
you find a couple of softer pieces of branch and

00:45:49.439 --> 00:45:53.717
vine that have fallen to the corruption. It's
interesting; you touch them and they're supple

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:59.956
like vines, but they're gray and freezing to the
touch. It's a very weird, unnatural feeling, but

00:45:59.956 --> 00:46:03.432
it seems supple.

00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:09.790
MARISHA: Before I do anything with it, I take it
over to Nila. Nila, have you seen any type of

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:16.203
blight on a plant like this before? Do you know
what this is? It's cold, feel it.

00:46:16.203 --> 00:46:22.903
SUMALEE: You're right. Do I know what this is?

00:46:22.903 --> 00:46:25.256
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:33.900
SUMALEE: I love making nature checks. Yes! 17.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:42.642
MATT: You've studied and seen, within the vicinity
of where you grew up and where your clan had

00:46:42.642 --> 00:46:53.924
raised you and your children, numerous types of
disease and natural means of plant life succumbing

00:46:54.273 --> 00:47:03.278
to illness or an outside force. What you can tell
is that this is not natural. This is not some

00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:12.236
naturally formed blight. There is some much older
and much more powerful latent reasoning for this corruption.

00:47:14.905 --> 00:47:18.810
SUMALEE: I do not feel safe using it.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:26.397
ASHLY: I know this is well-worn dwarf goof
territory, but does someone want to throw me?

00:47:26.397 --> 00:47:33.264
SAM: That seems very derogatory. Also you're super
heavy, though, aren't you?

00:47:33.264 --> 00:47:36.241
ASHLY: That's true. You all want to throw me?

00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:41.554
MARISHA: I take the branches and I try to lay them
down over the vines a little bit and give a little

00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:45.275
less thorny of a ramp.

00:47:45.275 --> 00:47:52.421
MATT: You lean them up against it and slowly they
bow over.

00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:58.452
MARISHA: Look, they hook all on their own, that's
pretty good.

00:47:58.452 --> 00:48:01.074
ASHLY: Good job, Beau.

00:48:01.074 --> 00:48:03.488
MARISHA: Thank you, look at that!

00:48:03.488 --> 00:48:05.657
SAM: We could try to throw you.

00:48:05.657 --> 00:48:08.475
ASHLY: I guess it might make more sense to throw
you, but I don't want to--

00:48:08.475 --> 00:48:09.934
SAM: No, you can throw me, sure.

00:48:09.934 --> 00:48:11.789
LIAM: Caleb starts to climb over.

00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:17.905
MATT: All right. Make a perception check.

00:48:17.905 --> 00:48:22.183
LIAM: 16.

00:48:22.183 --> 00:48:28.774
MATT: As you carefully place your hands across the
elements of vine and root, you manage to keep a

00:48:28.774 --> 00:48:35.840
keen glance for any sort of bladed, thorned, or
hooked elements that protrude from the local

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:43.635
fauna. You manage to avoid any of them from
catching your coat, catching your flesh, and step,

00:48:43.635 --> 00:48:47.171
leaping over to the opposite side without issue.

00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:50.348
SAM: That's amazing! He's amazing.

00:48:50.348 --> 00:48:57.725
LIAM: Nobody was aware I was panicked the whole
time. The thorns are almost like small razors.

00:48:57.725 --> 00:48:59.716
SAM: I'm coming!

00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:00.786
LIAM: Careful.

00:49:00.786 --> 00:49:02.192
SAM: I'm just going to dash over.

00:49:02.192 --> 00:49:04.015
MATT: You're just going to dash over? Make an
acrobatics check.

00:49:04.015 --> 00:49:07.310
SAM: That was 12 plus... 19.

00:49:08.553 --> 00:49:13.517
MATT: Caleb has shown areas, as he passed over,
where you can safely climb. The rest of you don't

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:18.141
need to make checks. Nott ignores this entirely
and goes leaping and flipping and attempting to

00:49:18.141 --> 00:49:29.898
make her way over. The actual fence bends slightly
at the impact of foot, the iron beneath having

00:49:29.898 --> 00:49:35.538
wilted due to long-form rust and whatever
perpetual weight has been placed upon it from this

00:49:35.538 --> 00:49:40.668
land attempting to reclaim it from underneath.
Nott leaps, double flip in the air, lands on the

00:49:40.668 --> 00:49:45.769
opposite side, skids a bit as your feet hit a
slight bit of the icy floor, but you manage to

00:49:45.769 --> 00:49:47.562
catch yourself, no issue.

00:49:47.562 --> 00:49:50.337
ASHLY: Keg holds up a ten.

00:49:50.337 --> 00:49:56.290
MATT: Each of you make your way over this element
of the forest, continuing on past the next two

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:05.315
boundaries, eventually making your way into the
central area of the Blooming Grove. The term now

00:50:05.315 --> 00:50:11.330
striking a bell as you look around and can see
these beautiful flowers as the sun rays hit and

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:19.478
pass. It's like the color flares up once the light
hits it and then seems to gray as it passes on.

00:50:19.478 --> 00:50:26.257
You now stand, temperature much warmer, and
there's just that stone structure ahead.

00:50:26.257 --> 00:50:28.292
LIAM: How far away is the structure?

00:50:28.292 --> 00:50:33.501
MATT: From where you're standing on the interior
of it, about 40 or so feet.

00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:41.506
MARISHA: On the tombstones that are around, do I
recognize any of the language, or can I tell how

00:50:41.506 --> 00:50:44.603
old some of these gravesites are?

00:50:44.603 --> 00:50:47.604
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:50:50.673 --> 00:50:55.113
MARISHA: 21.

00:50:55.113 --> 00:51:00.612
MATT: Looking through, there are a few languages
that come through, most of them are elven and they

00:51:00.612 --> 00:51:15.552
are very old. Some of them appear to be 100, 200,
400-500 years old. Whatever individuals or

00:51:15.552 --> 00:51:23.818
families or bloodlines have been interred in this
space have been placed here for a very long time,

00:51:23.818 --> 00:51:26.288
until recently.

00:51:26.288 --> 00:51:28.580
MARISHA: Until recently, okay.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:34.257
MATT: You do see one that appears to be maybe
about ten years old. Very faint elements of wear

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:35.802
and tear.

00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:37.808
MARISHA: What's the name?

00:51:37.808 --> 00:51:47.051
MATT: The name on that one would be Elvish and it
would be Tyriel Casala.

00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:49.756
MARISHA: Tyriel Castala?

00:51:49.756 --> 00:51:51.193
MATT: Casala.

00:51:51.193 --> 00:51:54.076
MARISHA: Casala.

00:51:54.076 --> 00:51:57.692
MATT: She knows Elvish, but she doesn't really
speak it often, so the pronunciations get a little weird.

00:51:58.111 --> 00:52:00.372
LIAM: <i>Domo arigato.</i>

00:52:00.372 --> 00:52:06.751
ASHLY: So should I go knock on that door?

00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:08.269
SAM: Is there a door?

00:52:08.269 --> 00:52:09.537
MATT: There is a door, yes.

00:52:09.537 --> 00:52:11.467
LIAM: Hold on.

00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:15.134
SAM: How big a place is the door place?

00:52:15.134 --> 00:52:21.207
MATT: The door itself is maybe four feet wide,
it's a single door. It's an old wood-- the bottom

00:52:21.207 --> 00:52:27.013
half of it is green with growing moss and other
bits of vegetation that are set in to the

00:52:27.013 --> 00:52:31.845
relatively damp wood that it's constructed from.
The top seems to be split and warped a little bit

00:52:31.845 --> 00:52:34.745
over time due to the moisture in the air.

00:52:34.745 --> 00:52:42.123
LIAM: Caleb tries to creep up to a gravestone and
hide behind it to get within 30 feet of the door.

00:52:42.123 --> 00:52:46.311
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:49.719
SAM: On the roof or the top of the-- sorry.

00:52:49.719 --> 00:52:51.162
LIAM: Nine.

00:52:51.162 --> 00:52:55.583
SAM: On the roof or top of the structure, are
there any holes or anything?

00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:57.890
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.181
SAM: 13.

00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:06.813
MATT: Best you can see, no. It's pretty well made.
The walls and the roof all appear to be made from stone.

00:53:07.199 --> 00:53:09.334
SAM: But no windows or anything?

00:53:09.334 --> 00:53:15.557
MATT: There are windows. You can only really see
the front and right side of it, the southeast side

00:53:15.557 --> 00:53:20.339
of it from your perspective-- there is a single
window. It is an arched window that looks like it

00:53:20.339 --> 00:53:25.342
may have been built at one point to hold glass or
stained glass, but it is no longer there. You can

00:53:25.342 --> 00:53:32.361
see the soft, jungle-like flora at the base of it
has swooped up and grown over and into the

00:53:32.361 --> 00:53:37.756
interior of the structure. Best you can tell from
this distance, there is no visible light

00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:44.026
immediately inside, but there is a bit of natural
light that is coming in through the open space.

00:53:44.026 --> 00:53:48.777
SAM: Can I go over to the window and take a peek
in, stealthily?

00:53:48.777 --> 00:53:50.891
MATT: Sure, roll a stealth check.

00:53:52.453 --> 00:53:59.882
SAM: 12. I'll take a big swig of booze and then go
over and try.

00:53:59.882 --> 00:54:08.014
MATT: Okay. You begin to dart across the open
space, dodging through gravestones and as you're

00:54:08.014 --> 00:54:13.837
passing one of them, there is a bit of a thorned
vine that catches the back of your cloak. It pulls

00:54:13.837 --> 00:54:21.514
taut before you get yanked on your neck, slip
back, and Nott slams on the ground giving a little sound.

00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:24.607
ASHLY: Keg holds up a ten.

00:54:24.607 --> 00:54:26.929
SAM: Why do you have that with you?

00:54:26.929 --> 00:54:30.313
ASHLY: I'm trying a bit. I'm trying a new thing.

00:54:30.313 --> 00:54:38.010
MATT: There's a brief pause, all of you hold in
silence hearing a distant bird that goes quiet,

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:54.425
the wind passing through the trees. You hear the
wooden door begins to slowly open as a shaded

00:54:54.425 --> 00:55:00.054
figure steps beyond the frame. Taliesin, if you
want to step in.

00:55:00.054 --> 00:55:04.069
(cheering)

00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:07.397
MATT: Finally! (laughing)

00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:11.808
TALIESIN: This is my stuff.

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:15.473
LIAM: You're really just a random shopkeep in the
woods?

00:55:15.473 --> 00:55:16.982
TALIESIN: It's dangerous to go alone--

00:55:16.982 --> 00:55:18.826
LIAM and TALIESIN: --take this!

00:55:18.826 --> 00:55:21.867
TALIESIN: Just going to get my stuff.

00:55:21.867 --> 00:55:27.059
MATT: Would you like to describe what they see
emerge from this small stone temple?

00:55:27.059 --> 00:55:37.487
TALIESIN: From this small stone temple emerges a
tall, not necessarily healthily thin firbolg, who

00:55:37.487 --> 00:55:46.100
is pale and a grayish color, and has a big shock
of weirdly pink mohawk hair--

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.152
LIAM: You don't say.

00:55:47.152 --> 00:55:48.713
SAM: No!

00:55:48.713 --> 00:55:57.570
TALIESIN: I'm going way off the reservation here.
He's a little gaunt. He's got a little fuzz, he's

00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:07.077
wearing this bizarre-- he's wearing this very
gentle silk shirt that's got one long, flowy

00:56:07.077 --> 00:56:21.112
sleeve. He's got a cup of tea. He's just staring.
Huh. I think I've only got three more cups. Hold

00:56:21.112 --> 00:56:26.678
on. I go back in.

00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:28.822
SAM: (shouting) Do you know her? Do you know him?

00:56:28.822 --> 00:56:31.512
SUMALEE: It's a firbolg! He is a firbolg!

00:56:31.512 --> 00:56:34.577
SAM: (shouting) Do you know him? What's his name?

00:56:34.577 --> 00:56:40.743
SUMALEE: I do not! But he's a firbolg! He is one
of my people! (gasps) He is a firbolg. This will

00:56:40.743 --> 00:56:45.215
be good. My smell bag was right again!

00:56:45.215 --> 00:56:49.803
TALIESIN: I'm going to come out, I'm going to have
a little kettle set up on a little tripod. I'm

00:56:49.803 --> 00:56:56.631
putting it down, I'm putting a big rod with a big
purple chunk of amethyst on it underneath the

00:56:56.631 --> 00:57:02.719
kettle. Tapping it a couple times to get the
kettle to start heating up. I'm going to wander

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:07.285
into the graveyard and find some flowers for tea.

00:57:07.285 --> 00:57:08.547
MATT: Okay.

00:57:08.547 --> 00:57:11.837
SAM: Can we tag along? Do you need any help?

00:57:11.837 --> 00:57:14.235
LIAM: Does he seem like he's going to kill us?

00:57:14.235 --> 00:57:15.807
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:57:15.807 --> 00:57:21.310
LIAM: Thank you. 19.

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.075
MATT: 19?

00:57:22.075 --> 00:57:24.238
LIAM: Nein-teen.

00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:30.282
MATT: There doesn't <i>seem</i> to be any threat at the
moment.

00:57:30.282 --> 00:57:35.812
TALIESIN: Mr. Clay, and nah, I'm fine. One
second.

00:57:35.812 --> 00:57:38.933
SAM: He's Mr. Clay.

00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:48.416
TALIESIN: I come back with a pile of red-purple
flowers and I'm grinding up. This is from Casala.

00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:56.077
Textile family generations ago, but they make very
good tea now. (sighs)

00:57:56.077 --> 00:57:59.253
MARISHA: Wait, back up a second. Are <i>you</i> Mr.
Clay?

00:57:59.253 --> 00:58:01.284
TALIESIN: Mm. Caduceus Clay. Sit.

00:58:01.284 --> 00:58:04.656
MARISHA: Caduceus Clay.

00:58:04.656 --> 00:58:07.169
TALIESIN: I'm going to put out the three cups and
wait for the pot to boil.

00:58:07.169 --> 00:58:12.579
SAM: Hello.

00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:17.506
MARISHA: Is that Caduceus with a K, or a C? Okay.

00:58:17.506 --> 00:58:22.863
SAM: Hi. Oh, we have to wait?

00:58:22.863 --> 00:58:32.341
TALIESIN: Pour out the three cups. You have to
share, I apologize.

00:58:32.341 --> 00:58:36.018
ASHLY: I don't drink tea. Booze is fine.

00:58:36.018 --> 00:58:38.002
LIAM: I come over and sit and take one of the
teas.

00:58:38.585 --> 00:58:41.691
MARISHA: Caleb and I will share one and I hand the
other to Nila.

00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:43.388
SUMALEE: I would love to try your tea.

00:58:43.388 --> 00:58:45.825
TALIESIN: Please, let me know what you think.

00:58:47.632 --> 00:58:49.712
SUMALEE: It is delicious.

00:58:49.712 --> 00:58:51.302
TALIESIN: Only grows here.

00:58:51.302 --> 00:58:52.742
SUMALEE: I would like to hug you.

00:58:52.742 --> 00:58:55.192
TALIESIN: Oh, please. Come.

00:58:55.192 --> 00:58:58.014
SUMALEE: Nila gives him a big hug!

00:58:58.014 --> 00:59:01.917
TALIESIN: I haven't had one of these in a long
time. That's nice.

00:59:01.917 --> 00:59:06.635
SUMALEE: I am from the Guiatao Tribe. Do you know
us?

00:59:06.635 --> 00:59:11.816
TALIESIN: No. I'm sure they're wonderful, though.
That sounds just great. That sounds wonderful.

00:59:11.816 --> 00:59:21.654
Friends! (sigh) You have come. (sigh) Please, let
me know what I can do for you. Usually when people

00:59:21.654 --> 00:59:25.428
come here, it is because of some great tragedy.
How can I alleve your pain?

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:29.167
LIAM: Oh, well, <i>Herr</i> Clay, we come to you with a
great tragedy.

00:59:29.167 --> 00:59:32.019
MARISHA: A few great tragedies.

00:59:32.019 --> 00:59:36.427
LIAM: Do you want to, or should I?

00:59:36.427 --> 00:59:42.672
MARISHA: Well, the first one is, I think, it's
time for Caleb to have another bath. It's been a

00:59:42.672 --> 00:59:44.006
little bit.

00:59:44.006 --> 00:59:46.264
LIAM: That's the first one?

00:59:46.264 --> 00:59:50.699
MARISHA: Being without a shower has been a bit of
a tragedy.

00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:53.555
LIAM: (whispering) Do we really have time for a
comedy bit like this?

00:59:53.555 --> 00:59:55.172
MARISHA: No.

00:59:55.172 --> 00:59:57.810
SAM: We recently lost one of our friends.

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:58.848
TALIESIN: I would assume.

00:59:58.848 --> 01:00:02.539
MARISHA: I didn't want to open the gate like that.
That's why we're here.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.564
TALIESIN: People who come here usually have.

01:00:04.564 --> 01:00:11.988
SAM: We aren't here to bury him. He's already in
the ground. We've come to avenge him and we were

01:00:11.988 --> 01:00:16.835
hoping to find some help in these parts.

01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:20.437
TALIESIN: Avenge him? What happened?

01:00:20.437 --> 01:00:22.117
ASHLY: Do you know the Iron Shepherds?

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:23.772
TALIESIN: Do I know the Iron Shepherds?

01:00:23.772 --> 01:00:26.851
MATT: You actually have not. You would have no
idea.

01:00:26.851 --> 01:00:31.564
TALIESIN: No, I'm sorry, I really don't get to
leave very often, especially these days.

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:33.839
LIAM: How long have you been alone out here?

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:44.298
TALIESIN: (contemplative sigh) Been 20 seasons
now, 18 seasons? Try not to count, it just gets in

01:00:44.298 --> 01:00:46.442
the way of more important things.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:50.872
LIAM: How many seasons has it been since someone
has knocked on your door like we have?

01:00:50.872 --> 01:00:59.830
TALIESIN: It's been about two seasons, I suppose.
Little bit of business, but it's been very slow.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:03.004
MARISHA: Do you only gauge time in seasons?

01:01:03.004 --> 01:01:05.727
TALIESIN: It's the only time that seems to
matter.

01:01:05.727 --> 01:01:07.329
MARISHA: That's fair.

01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:09.222
SUMALEE: I agree.

01:01:09.222 --> 01:01:14.768
SAM: Do you work here? Is this your place? Do you
own this land?

01:01:14.768 --> 01:01:16.288
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

01:01:16.288 --> 01:01:18.399
SAM: Are you the funeral director?

01:01:18.399 --> 01:01:22.608
TALIESIN: Most people who come here know what this
place is, this is going to be delightful. I've

01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:23.957
never had to explain it to someone before.

01:01:23.957 --> 01:01:25.250
SAM: It's a graveyard. It's a boneyard.

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:34.360
TALIESIN: Well, boneyard is a bit crass, but yeah,
this is a place where we take the dearly departed

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:40.374
who have done well and the people who have lived
good lives and we put them into earth that has

01:01:40.374 --> 01:01:46.894
been touched by the Wildmother. In turn, she
grants them with beauty and splendor and sometimes tea.

01:01:47.335 --> 01:01:51.967
SAM: Like a boneyard sort of a place?

01:01:51.967 --> 01:01:58.124
TALIESIN: More like a garden. We have been tending
this garden for generations.

01:01:58.124 --> 01:02:00.285
MARISHA: We're drinking dead people tea?

01:02:00.285 --> 01:02:02.089
TALIESIN: Aren't we all?

01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:03.908
LIAM: That is a very fair point.

01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:08.762
MARISHA: Very true. But you're cultivating dead
people for good tea?

01:02:08.762 --> 01:02:10.066
TALIESIN: Aren't we all?

01:02:10.066 --> 01:02:13.751
MARISHA: Yeah, okay. Yeah. That's a good point.

01:02:13.751 --> 01:02:18.304
LIAM: We are very random visitors from out of the
blue. We do come to you with tragedy. We do have a

01:02:18.304 --> 01:02:23.466
friend in the ground. We do have friends who are
in dire need of assistance. You help people into

01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:27.696
the ground, but offhand, do you help them <i>out</i> of
the ground?

01:02:27.696 --> 01:02:36.883
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, sometimes we can help
people who are on the edge of death. We certainly

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:42.839
understand that most people would rather spend
their time alive than not, and that makes sense. I

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:46.538
certainly have no interest in shortening my life
any time soon.

01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:50.238
SAM: But you can't bring someone back who's
already expired?

01:02:50.238 --> 01:02:57.738
TALIESIN: I mean, that's very tricky. Once you're
dead, there's a natural order to things. There's a

01:02:57.738 --> 01:03:02.001
movement that things have to go, but in certain
cases, I'm sure.

01:03:02.001 --> 01:03:10.858
LIAM: We've all read stories of the extraordinary,
but you do not have this in your wheelhouse, you

01:03:10.858 --> 01:03:12.252
are saying?

01:03:12.252 --> 01:03:16.081
TALIESIN: Oh, I can sometimes help people. You
never know.

01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:23.614
MARISHA: Okay, well, beyond helping our recently
passed friend, how do you feel about helping

01:03:23.614 --> 01:03:29.851
people who are on the edge of life and death in
captivity?

01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:32.846
LIAM: Three in the cage is worth one in the dirt.

01:03:32.846 --> 01:03:35.538
SUMALEE: There are firbolgs in this group, too,
that need help.

01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:39.437
SAM: They've been kidnapped, including a firbolg
child.

01:03:39.437 --> 01:03:41.675
MARISHA: And they might not have long to live.

01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:43.955
ASHLY: They're being held by the Iron Shepherds.

01:03:43.955 --> 01:03:48.338
SAM: Who are bad guys. We're good guys. Well,
we're sort of bad guys, too.

01:03:48.338 --> 01:03:49.845
MARISHA: We're working on it.

01:03:49.845 --> 01:03:50.966
LIAM: We are not bad guys.

01:03:50.966 --> 01:03:52.022
ASHLY: We're doing all right.

01:03:52.022 --> 01:03:53.147
SAM: Are you a bad guy?

01:03:53.147 --> 01:03:59.256
TALIESIN: You know, honestly, I don't think I've
had enough experience to have an opinion on that.

01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:02.534
I'm a good gardener.

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:06.555
SAM: What do you grow, other than dead tea?

01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:12.980
TALIESIN: I grow lilies, I grow bramble,
mushrooms, moss.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.314
MARISHA: Dead bramble. Dead mushrooms. Dead moss.

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:19.966
LIAM: If you are saying that you are able to help
people back from the brink of extinction, on

01:04:19.966 --> 01:04:25.734
occasion or under the right circumstances, I am
going to hazard a guess that you could heal a

01:04:25.734 --> 01:04:28.420
wound in a snap, yeah?

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:35.708
TALIESIN: Not with an actual snap, but yeah, I can
do that. I don't have to snap, though. I can be

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:39.746
really quiet when I do it-- pretty quiet, I
actually have to say something, now that I think

01:04:39.746 --> 01:04:42.064
about it.

01:04:42.064 --> 01:04:44.717
ASHLY: I'm going to take a guess: you don't
leave here very much, do you?

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:52.466
TALIESIN: I've left a few times, I suppose. It's
been a while. I've been on my own for a while. It

01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:57.073
makes you get a little rambly.

01:04:57.073 --> 01:05:04.625
SAM: You're stationed here? Are you allowed to
leave?

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:15.045
TALIESIN: That's a bit of a story. My family have
run this temple for generations, and I'm sort of

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.653
the last one left holding the fort down.

01:05:17.653 --> 01:05:19.352
SAM: No cousins or anything?

01:05:19.352 --> 01:05:27.939
TALIESIN: No cousins. A couple sisters, a brother,
my parents, but everyone's either wandered off to

01:05:27.939 --> 01:05:35.428
help try and fix what's been going wrong or has
been put into the earth.

01:05:35.428 --> 01:05:38.358
SAM: What's been going wrong? What's that? What's
going wrong?

01:05:38.358 --> 01:05:42.878
TALIESIN: Well, as I'm sure you've possibly
noticed, and I apologize if I'm breaking some

01:05:42.878 --> 01:05:49.153
terrible news to anyone who didn't, the forest
beyond my little patch of earth is a little

01:05:49.153 --> 01:06:01.508
unsavory. It's dark. It can be a bit dangerous.
Don't recommend going out alone. It has been

01:06:01.508 --> 01:06:09.386
overtaking our temple for the last hundred years,
and recently has breached the walls again.

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:13.239
SAM: So your family is trying to fix that?

01:06:13.239 --> 01:06:20.066
TALIESIN: The last one to leave was my sister. She
went east.

01:06:20.066 --> 01:06:22.025
LIAM: Now it's just you.

01:06:22.025 --> 01:06:25.030
TALIESIN: Now it's just me. It's not much to hold
down at this point.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.165
ASHLY: Why do you stay?

01:06:26.668 --> 01:06:30.587
TALIESIN: Honestly, because it's a little
dangerous for a lone person to leave. I figured

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:38.459
I'd sit here with a kettle and wait for someone to
come along, and maybe see if I can make my way out

01:06:38.459 --> 01:06:42.333
of here and figure out what's been happening in
this place.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.859
LIAM: Well, you're double lucky.

01:06:43.859 --> 01:06:47.331
SAM: This is great. So you don't have to check in
every night, and be here to punch in and punch

01:06:47.331 --> 01:06:49.983
out? You could leave whenever you want?

01:06:49.983 --> 01:06:53.182
TALIESIN: I could leave whenever I want, sure.

01:06:53.182 --> 01:06:57.401
MARISHA: Is there a watering system, or can you
put it on a timer if you're not going to be here?

01:06:57.401 --> 01:06:59.056
SAM: A drip-line?

01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:04.380
TALIESIN: That's a really good idea. I don't... I
mean, if you guys in a serious rush, if you could

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.860
help I'm sure we could figure out--

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.208
MARISHA: Maybe we're in a rush; maybe after.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:12.344
LIAM: <i>Herr</i> Clay, we are dealing with a
time-sensitive situation. You are looking for a

01:07:12.344 --> 01:07:17.320
segue out of this predicament you're in?

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.558
TALIESIN: Mmm.

01:07:19.558 --> 01:07:25.386
ASHLY: I feel like it's only fair to warn you: if
you were to come with us, we'd be asking you to go

01:07:25.386 --> 01:07:32.155
into a situation that's not very safe.

01:07:32.155 --> 01:07:33.881
TALIESIN: Are you inviting me to come with you?

01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:34.967
SUMALEE: Yes, very much.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.842
ASHLY: Oh, yeah, sorry-- did we not--

01:07:36.842 --> 01:07:41.170
SAM: We came here seeking help in a mission that
we're about to go on.

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:45.307
TALIESIN: That's excellent. You're lucky I came
along, then. This is going to work out really well.

01:07:46.477 --> 01:07:48.314
MARISHA: Well, we came to you.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:51.121
TALIESIN: Well, you're lucky that I stayed right
here so that you intercepted me, because if I had

01:07:51.121 --> 01:07:55.376
wandered off ten, 15 feet this may have never
happened.

01:07:55.376 --> 01:08:03.102
LIAM: <i>Herr</i> Clay, we should be very honest with
you. We are intending to do good by people who

01:08:03.102 --> 01:08:11.213
deserve it. A young one. Good people. But we are
going to do very difficult business tonight or tomorrow.

01:08:11.496 --> 01:08:17.474
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know if I think that
anyone deserves anything, but I don't like cages,

01:08:17.474 --> 01:08:25.894
and I'm really--

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:34.983
MARISHA: You don't have a particular penchant or
sympathy towards people who eat babies, do you?

01:08:34.983 --> 01:08:43.279
TALIESIN: That seems a little specific. I'm mostly
interested in trying to take care of the natural

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:46.409
order of the world and nature itself.

01:08:46.409 --> 01:08:49.884
ASHLY: Does murder end up on that checklist?

01:08:49.884 --> 01:08:53.044
TALIESIN: Have you ever <i>been</i> in nature? Yes.
Violence is extremely natural.

01:08:53.044 --> 01:08:53.963
ASHLY: Tight.

01:08:53.963 --> 01:09:02.483
SUMALEE: No, the people we are after have done
terrible things. They have upset the balance of

01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:10.538
nature so much by what they have done. They do not
deserve to live. Please come with us. I have an

01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:18.547
idea. If you can come with us, maybe some of the
firbolgs from my tribe can come help you here

01:09:18.547 --> 01:09:22.062
afterwards-- can help keep the temple afterwards.

01:09:22.062 --> 01:09:28.460
TALIESIN: Well, I don't know about deserve, but I
think there's always somewhere there's a plant

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:34.287
that needs some compost, and I'm happy to make
some more if it'll make people happy.

01:09:34.287 --> 01:09:37.288
MARISHA: Was that you saying you're willing to
kill people and put them in the ground to make compost?!

01:09:37.318 --> 01:09:38.696
SAM: I think so.

01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:41.795
TALIESIN: You got a lot of aggression. You got a
lot of anger.

01:09:41.795 --> 01:09:45.772
MARISHA: Oh man, you're seeing me at a relatively
calm moment, actually.

01:09:45.772 --> 01:09:48.886
LIAM: Welcome to The Mighty Nein.

01:09:48.886 --> 01:09:50.234
TALIESIN: There's only--

01:09:50.234 --> 01:09:51.340
MARISHA: Don't overthink it.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.216
TALIESIN: Okay!

01:09:52.216 --> 01:09:54.395
SAM: Do you know Pumat Sol, by any chance?

01:09:54.395 --> 01:09:55.459
ASHLY: Nott!

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:56.967
SAM: What?

01:09:56.967 --> 01:09:58.072
TALIESIN: Is that a time of plant?

01:09:58.072 --> 01:10:01.855
SAM: All right, then no. No, I just had to ask.

01:10:01.855 --> 01:10:03.874
TALIESIN: I've actually already packed; I'll go
get my things.

01:10:03.874 --> 01:10:10.585
SAM: What?! Wait, what would we owe you for this?

01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:11.849
LIAM: Do you require anything?

01:10:11.849 --> 01:10:13.767
TALIESIN: I do; I may ask for it later.

01:10:13.767 --> 01:10:14.576
SAM: Money?

01:10:14.576 --> 01:10:16.165
LIAM: You'll have it.

01:10:16.165 --> 01:10:17.588
SUMALEE: Firbolgs do not need money.

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:19.801
LIAM: You'll have it.

01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:20.922
SAM: Tea?

01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:25.603
TALIESIN: I like this one. I'll go get my green
beetle armor.

01:10:25.603 --> 01:10:28.742
SAM: What?

01:10:28.742 --> 01:10:34.065
SUMALEE: (excited gasp) I have not come across a
firbolg with green beetle armor!

01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:36.680
TALIESIN: Thank you. My sister made it; I'm very
proud of her.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:44.419
MATT: It's a chitinous-looking metal breastplate
that has a somewhat pearlescent turquoise

01:10:44.419 --> 01:10:50.194
green-blue tint to it that seems to shift in the
light.

01:10:50.194 --> 01:10:57.154
TALIESIN: I get a big, knotted, wet-looking stick
that is covered in lichen. The armor is also

01:10:57.154 --> 01:11:03.096
covered in lichen. It's a big growing, living wet
thing. It has a big purple amethyst rock at the

01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:07.550
top of the staff. I get a little shield also made
out of beetle.

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:09.558
LIAM: Motherfucking druid.

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:11.823
MARISHA: (whispering) Fungal armor!

01:11:11.823 --> 01:11:21.502
TALIESIN: (sighs) Give me a minute. Just going to
walk around once, take it in.

01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:27.073
SAM: If the thing he needs from us is our blood or
something, shouldn't we know that in advance? We

01:11:27.073 --> 01:11:32.728
should find out what he wants from us before we
just blindly agree to this. What if he wants Keg?

01:11:32.728 --> 01:11:34.359
LIAM: (whispering) We'll figure that out.

01:11:34.359 --> 01:11:38.739
SAM: Some sort of, like, concubine thing? I don't
know! What if he's creepy or freaky like that!

01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:40.465
ASHLY: I'm kind of into that.

01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:41.963
SAM: Really?

01:11:41.963 --> 01:11:43.174
ASHLY: I'm not picky.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:43.976
SAM: Wow.

01:11:43.976 --> 01:11:50.542
MARISHA: Your blood-- you got some to spare. You
can get more of it. That's how your body works.

01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:53.956
SAM: What?!

01:11:53.956 --> 01:12:01.337
SUMALEE: He does not seem freaky to me at all. He
seems very nice. Like a normal firbolg.

01:12:01.337 --> 01:12:03.125
SAM: (warily) Okay.

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:11.311
TALIESIN: All right. I'm ready to leave. This is
going to be a little much, but I think I can do

01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:14.236
it. I'm ready.

01:12:14.236 --> 01:12:20.992
MARISHA: Hey Clay? Did you bury Tyriel Colsala
here?

01:12:20.992 --> 01:12:23.702
TALIESIN: Casala?

01:12:23.702 --> 01:12:26.414
MARISHA: Yeah, him. That's what I said.

01:12:26.414 --> 01:12:29.195
TALIESIN: What did you think you were drinking?

01:12:29.195 --> 01:12:31.742
MARISHA: (accented) Casala?

01:12:31.742 --> 01:12:37.937
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's very close. It's good. It's
always worth trying.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:41.990
MARISHA: Were you around when you buried him?

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:47.734
TALIESIN: Casala family, I think we have eight in
their generation; I was only here for the last two.

01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:52.811
MARISHA: All right.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.122
LIAM: So! Let me tell you about the murderers we
are dealing with.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.753
SAM: While we walk.

01:12:58.753 --> 01:13:00.729
MARISHA: Power walking?

01:13:00.729 --> 01:13:01.812
ASHLY: Yep.

01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:05.353
MATT: All right. Making your trek back to the
forest. Are you helming this as well?

01:13:05.353 --> 01:13:06.692
LIAM: First, there was the dinosaurs.

01:13:06.692 --> 01:13:08.976
(laughter)

01:13:08.976 --> 01:13:11.910
SUMALEE: May I helm it with Clay?

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:15.427
TALIESIN: Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. You can call me
Clay.

01:13:15.427 --> 01:13:16.389
SUMALEE: Caduceus.

01:13:16.389 --> 01:13:17.615
LIAM, MARISHA, and SAM: Deuces!

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:19.838
SUMALEE: Deuces Clay.

01:13:19.838 --> 01:13:22.448
SAM: It is decided.

01:13:22.448 --> 01:13:26.683
TALIESIN: I have been trying not to show you this
art for two weeks now.

01:13:26.683 --> 01:13:31.263
MATT: Caduceus, are you wanting to help? Or Nila,
I think, is asking for your help in fording this

01:13:31.263 --> 01:13:32.848
forest, as you have a little more experience.

01:13:32.848 --> 01:13:33.711
TALIESIN: Sure!

01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:35.121
MATT: So make your survival check with advantage.

01:13:35.121 --> 01:13:36.806
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:13:36.806 --> 01:13:41.016
SAM: Where are we going? Back to town, or straight
to the--

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:44.688
ASHLY: Oh yeah. Do we want to go and try to get
some Taskers on our side? We have a healer now,

01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.936
but we still don't have--

01:13:46.936 --> 01:13:47.763
SUMALEE: 21.

01:13:47.763 --> 01:13:49.069
MATT: 14 and a 14.

01:13:49.069 --> 01:13:50.616
SUMALEE: I got 14 and 14.

01:13:50.616 --> 01:13:52.320
MATT: It's up to you guys.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.408
SUMALEE: I don't think we need them.

01:13:55.408 --> 01:13:57.568
ASHLY: You don't think we need any more help?

01:13:57.568 --> 01:14:00.820
MARISHA: We might be all right.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:04.220
SAM: We don't even know what he <i>does!</i>

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.934
ASHLY: I'm with Nott!

01:14:05.934 --> 01:14:19.815
SAM: He's a firbolg, yeah, but... Hey, Mr. Clay?
I'm going to shoot Beau with my crossbow.

01:14:19.815 --> 01:14:22.304
TALIESIN: That doesn't seem like a very good
idea.

01:14:22.304 --> 01:14:23.342
SAM: Oh, I missed.

01:14:23.342 --> 01:14:25.485
(laughter)

01:14:25.485 --> 01:14:27.610
MATT: (arrow whizzing away)

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:28.914
SAM: 12.

01:14:28.914 --> 01:14:29.979
MARISHA: Yeah, no.

01:14:29.979 --> 01:14:32.697
SAM: Sorry, I was just going to test if he could
really heal you.

01:14:32.697 --> 01:14:34.307
MARISHA: The fuck?!

01:14:34.307 --> 01:14:37.567
SAM: I'll shoot again with my bonus action! That's
a natural 20.

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:40.290
(laughter)

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:41.879
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:14:41.879 --> 01:14:44.534
TALIESIN: You make me figure out how to do this.

01:14:44.534 --> 01:14:46.987
SUMALEE: Don't worry, I can cure them, too.

01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:53.897
SAM: Not a sneak attack, because she was looking.
Oh boy. That's ten, but it's a crit. Does that do anything?

01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:55.964
MATT: Well, you double the dice that you rolled.

01:14:55.964 --> 01:14:57.817
SAM: Okay, so that's 12 plus four is 16.

01:14:57.817 --> 01:14:59.790
MATT: You take 16 points of piercing damage,
Beau.

01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:00.722
MARISHA: I'm going to try to catch it.

01:15:00.722 --> 01:15:02.617
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:15:02.617 --> 01:15:03.675
MARISHA: Okay, I roll a d10.

01:15:03.675 --> 01:15:06.009
MATT: Roll a d10.

01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:12.643
MARISHA: A ten! Plus my monk level, right? Which
is five.

01:15:12.643 --> 01:15:14.202
MATT: I think so. Is that what it says right
there?

01:15:14.202 --> 01:15:14.986
LIAM: So only one hit point?

01:15:14.986 --> 01:15:17.650
SAM: Just the tip.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:28.548
MARISHA: 1d10 plus eight. Oh, it's my monk level
plus my proficiency bonus, so no damage.

01:15:28.548 --> 01:15:36.458
MATT: It goes for right underneath where the
clavicle and the neck meet and catches it right there.

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:41.862
SAM: Oh, but with this crossbow, when I roll a
natural 20, it shoots another one immediately.

01:15:41.862 --> 01:15:44.474
MATT: That's right!

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:46.070
SAM: Do I have to roll for that one?

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:47.378
MATT: You have to roll to attack.

01:15:47.378 --> 01:15:49.165
SAM: That's a 23 to hit.

01:15:49.165 --> 01:15:52.847
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that one.

01:15:52.847 --> 01:15:56.127
SAM: Eight.

01:15:56.127 --> 01:16:02.746
MATT: What happens is you pull back to fire, and
as it gets ready to go ahead and extend it looks

01:16:02.746 --> 01:16:08.723
like another bolt slips up into it accidentally
and it fires two in a row. Beau catches one and is

01:16:08.723 --> 01:16:15.513
like "Ugh, ow!" and there's a second one that's
jammed right into the space between two ribs.

01:16:15.513 --> 01:16:16.884
ASHLY: What the hell, Nott!

01:16:16.884 --> 01:16:20.725
SAM: First of all, that was cool. And this was
cool!

01:16:20.725 --> 01:16:23.308
MARISHA: And third of all, that was a killing
blow!

01:16:23.308 --> 01:16:25.029
SAM: Now, do your thing!

01:16:25.029 --> 01:16:27.122
MARISHA: You could fucking kill me!

01:16:27.122 --> 01:16:30.144
TALIESIN: Is she always like this? This seems kind
of extreme.

01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:32.335
SUMALEE: This is the most extreme I've ever seen
her.

01:16:32.335 --> 01:16:34.400
SAM: Do your thing!

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.171
MARISHA: I'm keeping this bolt, this is mine now.

01:16:37.171 --> 01:16:38.543
SAM: Okay.

01:16:38.543 --> 01:16:46.224
MARISHA: I rip the other one out. Yeah! I put
that, and I'm keeping this one, too!

01:16:46.224 --> 01:16:49.470
ASHLY: Keg is aroused.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:58.377
TALIESIN: Come here. All right, and I get in there
and I'm going to do Cure Wounds and there's going

01:16:58.377 --> 01:17:04.476
to be a little bit of lichen that grows on the
wound really quickly.

01:17:04.476 --> 01:17:06.215
MARISHA: Don't infect me!

01:17:06.215 --> 01:17:09.773
TALIESIN: It's fine. Do I roll for that?

01:17:09.773 --> 01:17:14.482
MATT: Yeah, it's a d8 plus your wisdom modifier.
The wound seems to close as you watch this--

01:17:14.482 --> 01:17:17.517
TALIESIN: Six points of damage-- six points of
healing.

01:17:17.517 --> 01:17:25.545
MATT: You go up by six. You watch as this bright
red-pink colored lichen, mossy material, seems to

01:17:25.545 --> 01:17:31.029
come out of the wound and close it and then turn
gray, break away, and crumble off. Where it is,

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:36.853
the wound seems to have closed and healed over,
like weeks of healing have gone by.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:39.545
MARISHA: Okay, this shit's dope.

01:17:39.545 --> 01:17:40.901
SAM: You're welcome.

01:17:40.901 --> 01:17:43.530
ASHLY: Probably a different way we could have
demonstrated that, Nott.

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:44.788
TALIESIN: It felt very--

01:17:44.788 --> 01:17:49.611
MARISHA: That wasn't for you. Never mind.

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:52.643
SUMALEE: They can be strange, but they are good.

01:17:52.643 --> 01:17:56.465
TALIESIN: Honestly, it's been so long since I've
been around anybody, I genuinely wouldn't have

01:17:56.465 --> 01:17:59.838
been able to tell.

01:17:59.838 --> 01:18:04.894
MATT: In making your journey back toward
Shadycreek Run, the sun does set part way through

01:18:04.894 --> 01:18:15.628
your journey. The forest goes dark, nearly pitch
black. Now, I believe all of you but Caleb have

01:18:15.628 --> 01:18:24.919
some sort of darkvision. At this point, the
crickets start coming out very loudly, the distant

01:18:24.919 --> 01:18:33.124
sound of skittering and animal movements through
brush and dry leaves catch the outside of your

01:18:33.124 --> 01:18:41.128
peripheral. You manage to stop every now and then,
as Nila puts her hand up, listening and smelling

01:18:41.128 --> 01:18:47.577
for anything nearby. Are you guys continuing at a
fast pace, or are you attempting to be stealthy?

01:18:47.577 --> 01:18:49.495
ASHLY: Well, did we decide what we're doing?

01:18:49.495 --> 01:18:51.344
MARISHA: I think we were going to go straight
there.

01:18:51.344 --> 01:18:53.203
ASHLY: We're going straight to the Shepherds?

01:18:53.203 --> 01:18:54.211
MARISHA: It's on the way.

01:18:54.211 --> 01:18:55.620
LIAM: We didn't really discuss; we got
distracted.

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.998
MATT: That's true. Are you guys heading back to
Shadycreek, or are you heading straight to the

01:18:57.998 --> 01:18:59.045
Sour Nest?

01:18:59.045 --> 01:19:00.261
SAM: Is it on the way?

01:19:00.261 --> 01:19:03.917
MARISHA: It's on the way. I say we at least stop
by and scout it.

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:07.988
SAM: If it's more or less on the way then yeah, we
can at least swing by.

01:19:07.988 --> 01:19:13.668
MATT: It'll add an hour or so to go into
Shadycreek. Essentially this is Shadycreek Run at

01:19:13.668 --> 01:19:20.305
the bottom of the forest and you've traveled, from
your perspective, far northwest to get to the area

01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:25.504
where you met Caduceus. You're now heading back
down and the Sour Nest is on the northeastern side

01:19:25.504 --> 01:19:29.315
of the city, just outside of it, so you have to
scoot and ricochet off.

01:19:29.315 --> 01:19:32.846
SAM: So we'd have to go through the town just to
get there?

01:19:32.846 --> 01:19:37.297
MATT: No, you could go straight to it through the
forest, but it depends on what you want to do. If

01:19:37.297 --> 01:19:41.060
you're going straight there or if you're wanting
to skim through Shadycreek, it's your choice.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:44.748
MARISHA: How long after dusk has it been?

01:19:44.748 --> 01:19:54.843
MATT: The sun set. With that roll you made, you'll
be arriving at Shadycreek Run at about 10:00pm.

01:19:54.843 --> 01:19:59.095
LIAM: We are going to find somebody, spur of the
moment, tell them to come with us out to the

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:03.462
woods? To do a bit of dark business?

01:20:03.462 --> 01:20:05.478
MARISHA: Are you being facetious? I can't tell.

01:20:05.478 --> 01:20:10.788
LIAM: No, I don't know if that's a good idea, I
don't like our options at the moment, any of them

01:20:10.788 --> 01:20:15.659
really. I feel like we don't have-- we are one
more person than when we got our asses handed to

01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:27.582
us on the road, and we thought we had the upper
hand then. Now we have one more, that is better,

01:20:27.582 --> 01:20:35.257
but if we go to the town and we find a couple of
ne'er-do-wells who'll work for coin, we are

01:20:35.257 --> 01:20:40.701
convincing them to come with us right away, into
the woods. Into the woods.

01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:45.035
SAM: Into the woods and out of the woods?

01:20:45.035 --> 01:20:52.635
TALIESIN: That would be the hope, I imagine, you'd
leave the woods once you went into the woods. I

01:20:52.635 --> 01:20:56.900
mean, you don't just want to sit there. I mean,
that's what I do, but I'm not sure that was really

01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:01.590
a great decision, so, yeah, huh.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:04.373
SAM: Are you talking to us?

01:21:04.373 --> 01:21:08.680
TALIESIN: I'm just thinking out loud. I've had a
few years to just think out loud.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.439
SAM: How old are you?

01:21:10.439 --> 01:21:16.397
MARISHA: How many seasons old are you?

01:21:16.397 --> 01:21:19.448
TALIESIN: Been about 100, give or take.

01:21:19.448 --> 01:21:26.416
SAM: But there's four seasons? Or is it three
seasons up here? I don't know.

01:21:26.416 --> 01:21:28.225
MARISHA: 25.

01:21:28.225 --> 01:21:30.670
SAM: He's between 25 and 100.

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:33.151
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:21:33.151 --> 01:21:39.215
LIAM: What do you think?

01:21:39.215 --> 01:21:47.809
MARISHA: I'm still afraid if we roll into
Shadycreek-- once again, just pointing out what we

01:21:47.809 --> 01:21:55.418
are: two firbolgs, a goblin, and then some kind of
acceptable-looking people and someone with a

01:21:55.418 --> 01:22:00.348
reputation. Well, by society's standards.

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.895
ASHLY: A lot of shade just got thrown.

01:22:01.895 --> 01:22:03.170
MARISHA: Look, come on!

01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:06.465
LIAM: If we do that, the three of us would do the
talking, naturally.

01:22:06.465 --> 01:22:11.783
MARISHA: I'm just saying, we will draw attention
to ourselves, and then we might go around asking

01:22:11.783 --> 01:22:16.649
people to kill the Iron Shepherds, and that might
draw more attention to ourselves in a town that it

01:22:16.649 --> 01:22:24.007
feels the Iron Shepherds kind of run. Or at least
have a better foothold in it than we do.

01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:32.498
ASHLY: How would this be different? That's my
question. One more person, sure. A healer? Sure. But--

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:40.766
LIAM: Well, we could take them at night, which we
did not do before. Some of them would be awake,

01:22:40.766 --> 01:22:48.049
probably not all of them. We had the element of
surprise before, we hopefully have it now.

01:22:48.049 --> 01:22:49.430
ASHLY: They're on home turf.

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:51.328
LIAM: Home turf is big.

01:22:51.328 --> 01:23:00.743
SAM: Can I just say, again, I don't give a shit
about Ophelia's request or The Gentleman's offer.

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:09.085
I just want to get all of our friends and get out.
If we can kill them, great, but if our aim is not

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:12.794
to kill them it makes this a much easier mission.

01:23:12.794 --> 01:23:16.201
MARISHA: Do you know Ophelia, Clay?

01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:17.761
TALIESIN: No.

01:23:17.761 --> 01:23:20.353
MARISHA: Sorry, you just had a face like you
recognized.

01:23:20.353 --> 01:23:24.384
TALIESIN: I had to think a little bit about it,
but no.

01:23:24.384 --> 01:23:28.943
LIAM: You know, Nott, I agree with you. The most
important thing is getting the people who are in

01:23:28.943 --> 01:23:37.132
that basement. The most important thing. You've
always got to improvise.

01:23:37.132 --> 01:23:39.849
SAM: Yes.

01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:45.289
ASHLY: So you're saying go in with the plan of
killing them and then switch it up if need be?

01:23:45.289 --> 01:23:50.689
LIAM: The only thing that I believe is known is
taking care of the people on that wall, anyone

01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:56.448
outside. I will send Frumpkin around to see if
there are more than just these two, then we will

01:23:56.448 --> 01:24:04.658
have decisions to make. We will need to send in
Frumpkin again or our new friend here. One of us,

01:24:04.658 --> 01:24:13.180
one of them and make a plan from there. That is
all we know now. We need to do something and I

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:23.078
feel a little on edge with our numbers, but I am
maybe more on edge by the ticking clock.

01:24:23.078 --> 01:24:24.556
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:24.556 --> 01:24:31.045
SAM: Let's swing by the baddies' house and just
see what's going on?

01:24:31.045 --> 01:24:35.146
MARISHA: Anyone in particular feel super strongly
about going and getting more help? Should we put

01:24:35.146 --> 01:24:37.154
it to a vote?

01:24:37.154 --> 01:24:39.181
SUMALEE: Do you carry a smell bag?

01:24:39.181 --> 01:24:40.758
TALIESIN: A what?

01:24:40.758 --> 01:24:45.359
ASHLY: So much disappointment.

01:24:45.359 --> 01:24:50.748
SAM: She sniffs a purse every time she wants to
make a decision.

01:24:50.748 --> 01:24:52.039
ASHLY: It's worked out so far.

01:24:52.039 --> 01:24:54.552
SUMALEE: It's filled with things from nature that
I find significant.

01:24:54.552 --> 01:24:59.903
TALIESIN: That seems like a really good idea
actually. I should start doing that.

01:24:59.903 --> 01:25:01.601
SUMALEE: It helps me so much.

01:25:01.601 --> 01:25:03.231
TALIESIN: What a good way to make a decision.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:07.235
MARISHA: What does your smell bag say? Do we go
and we get more people or do we go to the house?

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:14.638
SUMALEE: I do not need to check it. No smell check
necessary.

01:25:14.638 --> 01:25:16.654
MARISHA: Make a smell check.

01:25:16.654 --> 01:25:21.513
SUMALEE: I just want to go. It will be okay. We
have two firbolgs.

01:25:21.513 --> 01:25:23.835
MARISHA: I mean, she's so convincing.

01:25:23.835 --> 01:25:29.757
ASHLY: Nila, I love your enthusiasm, but again,
they're on home turf, they have more people than I

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:35.912
thought, more abilities than I thought. I mean, we
hire a couple of Taskers. I know it's not ideal, but if--

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:44.509
MARISHA: All right, new plan. We split the party!

01:25:44.509 --> 01:25:47.761
SAM: No! Terrible idea.

01:25:47.761 --> 01:25:50.861
MARISHA: Half go to the house, the other half go
look for more help and then we meet you.

01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:52.427
SAM: How's the half at the house going to do?

01:25:52.427 --> 01:25:52.690
MARISHA: Watch.

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:53.864
SAM: No.

01:25:53.864 --> 01:25:55.168
MARISHA: All right.

01:25:55.168 --> 01:25:59.659
SAM: Let's swing by the house and check it out. If
there's a raging party, we'll just continue on to

01:25:59.659 --> 01:26:05.763
town. If it seems dead, maybe we'll do a little
recon. If the recon goes well, maybe we'll do a

01:26:05.763 --> 01:26:09.759
little insertion.

01:26:09.759 --> 01:26:11.379
ASHLY: Are you describing a date right now?

01:26:11.379 --> 01:26:16.655
SAM: The insertion goes well, maybe we go steady.

01:26:16.655 --> 01:26:20.905
TALIESIN: I don't know what any of that means.

01:26:20.905 --> 01:26:25.025
SUMALEE: You will get used to it. I just laugh
along now.

01:26:25.025 --> 01:26:27.231
TALIESIN: All right.

01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:40.564
ASHLY: Look, they're your people, so I'll leave it
to you guys, but I don't love the odds.

01:26:40.564 --> 01:26:46.563
SUMALEE: I know because of your abilities, if we
can draw more of them outside, we will stand a

01:26:46.563 --> 01:26:53.268
better chance. We will have more power than you
had last time.

01:26:53.268 --> 01:26:55.882
MARISHA: Let's go to the house.

01:26:55.882 --> 01:26:57.276
SAM: We're just going to watch.

01:26:57.276 --> 01:26:58.196
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:26:58.196 --> 01:27:02.333
SAM: We're going to see what it's like at night so
if we have to come back tomorrow night, we'll know

01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:07.674
what to expect. Are there more guards at night? We
don't know, they could have six more dudes who

01:27:07.674 --> 01:27:09.699
come up there at night.

01:27:09.699 --> 01:27:11.570
MARISHA: Let's go. We're wasting time just
talking.

01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:12.962
SAM: We'll just look.

01:27:12.962 --> 01:27:15.544
MARISHA: We'll go look.

01:27:15.544 --> 01:27:23.176
MATT: Okay, so you head straight to The Sour Nest?
All right. Over the next couple of hours, you make

01:27:23.176 --> 01:27:31.066
your way, scooting as opposed to the more southern
direction you were traveling, heading eastward.

01:27:31.066 --> 01:27:39.426
Carefully making your way on the outskirts of the
northern side of North Clover of Shadycreek Run, I

01:27:39.426 --> 01:27:41.222
need you all to make stealth checks.

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.732
MARISHA: Shit.

01:27:42.732 --> 01:27:44.981
MATT: Disadvantage for you, Keg, unfortunately.

01:27:44.981 --> 01:27:47.320
ASHLY: Fuck.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:52.273
TALIESIN: Tonight, can I just politely ask the
forest to just give us a round this time, just in

01:27:52.273 --> 01:27:58.909
case? I want to talk to a couple of trees, see if
they'd be all right just giving us a little passage.

01:28:00.136 --> 01:28:03.459
MATT: Okay. Roll a wisdom check.

01:28:03.459 --> 01:28:05.650
TALIESIN: All right. Wisdom save or wisdom check?

01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.902
MATT: Wisdom check.

01:28:06.902 --> 01:28:10.624
TALIESIN: All right. 21.

01:28:10.624 --> 01:28:16.083
MATT: You bend in quietly, placing your hand
against one of the nearby trees, the bark being

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:24.265
cold and somewhat soft from the moisture of the
snow that had melted from the day before. You feel

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:34.016
the oppressive sense of the central nature that
encompasses the Savalierwood give way ever so faintly.

01:28:36.551 --> 01:28:45.325
ASHLY: Wait. Maybe a stupid idea. You guys can
talk to plants. Plants are neutral. What if we

01:28:45.325 --> 01:28:47.806
lead them into the woods?

01:28:47.806 --> 01:28:48.668
SAM: What?

01:28:48.668 --> 01:28:51.669
SUMALEE: Now you're thinking like I was. I didn't
have that specific idea--

01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:53.972
ASHLY: The Iron Shepherds. We could lure them into
the woods.

01:28:53.972 --> 01:28:55.250
SAM: And then what?

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:57.056
ASHLY: We fight them in there.

01:28:57.056 --> 01:29:00.880
SUMALEE: We can have the plants entangle them.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.023
ASHLY: I don't know, it could be a backup if this
plan goes south, if they wake up or something. But

01:29:06.023 --> 01:29:11.602
if they can talk to the plants-- the woods are
anyone's game. They'd be fighting other creatures,

01:29:11.602 --> 01:29:13.014
not just us.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.732
LIAM: But what is it that lures the Shepherds out
of their hole?

01:29:15.732 --> 01:29:16.901
SAM: They won't leave.

01:29:16.901 --> 01:29:19.242
MARISHA: I've got fireworks.

01:29:19.242 --> 01:29:27.129
SUMALEE: I can put a stink bomb inside. Really
stinky, not like what you call my stink pouch.

01:29:27.129 --> 01:29:31.859
LIAM: That will put them in the courtyard, it will
not probably put them in the woods.

01:29:31.859 --> 01:29:38.561
SAM: We'd need to take one of theirs, take Lorenzo
or something. They'd have to come after us. There

01:29:38.561 --> 01:29:40.932
would be no reason for them to leave.

01:29:40.932 --> 01:29:45.629
ASHLY: Do I know if Lorenzo is a loyal person,
like would he give or would he just let someone

01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:48.431
die if they got taken?

01:29:48.431 --> 01:29:54.153
MATT: Best that you can tell, he's not a "leave no
man behind" type individual.

01:29:54.153 --> 01:29:55.534
ASHLY: Okay.

01:29:55.534 --> 01:29:56.473
MARISHA: He isn't?

01:29:56.473 --> 01:29:57.496
MATT: He is not.

01:29:57.496 --> 01:30:00.180
ASHLY: But he is a vengeful type of individual?

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:05.128
MATT: He's definitely a fan of an eye for an eye.

01:30:05.128 --> 01:30:10.345
ASHLY: If it goes south, and we manage to kill one
of them, he might chase us.

01:30:10.345 --> 01:30:12.350
LIAM: True.

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:13.975
SAM: Or maybe not.

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:16.641
ASHLY: Or maybe not. It could be a backup.

01:30:16.641 --> 01:30:18.060
SAM: No, it's good.

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.829
LIAM and MARISHA: Let's go.

01:30:20.829 --> 01:30:22.224
ASHLY: Oh, stealth checks, right.

01:30:22.224 --> 01:30:24.860
MATT: Stealth checks.

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:30.001
TALIESIN: First stealth check. Where's my stealth?
Seven.

01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:31.621
SAM: 26.

01:30:31.621 --> 01:30:32.701
ASHLY: Seven.

01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:33.637
LIAM: Ten.

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:34.687
MARISHA: 12.

01:30:34.687 --> 01:30:35.697
SUMALEE: 20.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.631
MATT: Okay.

01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:40.631
ASHLY: These are such bad stealth checks.

01:30:40.631 --> 01:30:44.766
MATT: Thanks to you speaking with nature, I am
ignoring one of the lowest stealth rolls.

01:30:44.766 --> 01:30:47.546
ASHLY: Only one?

01:30:47.546 --> 01:31:00.403
MATT: Even still, you approach the outskirts of
The Sour Nest. The clouds of the night are broken

01:31:00.403 --> 01:31:07.098
here and there, the very darkened night
occasionally broken by the errant moonbeam that

01:31:07.098 --> 01:31:13.341
manages to sweep through the open grove where this
fortress was built. The canopy itself cleared out,

01:31:13.341 --> 01:31:19.722
leaving it open for the occasional peek of white
through the clouds. The same perimeter wall you

01:31:19.722 --> 01:31:26.521
see being slowly trained across by two guards
dressed in the same hooded attire as those that

01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:35.018
you previously saw. As you saw as well bringing
the three carts northward from the Glory Run Road.

01:31:35.018 --> 01:31:48.222
As you begin to approach, Keg, unfortunately,
manages to step on a hornet's nest. It crunches

01:31:48.222 --> 01:31:54.930
under your foot, and, for a brief second, you
inhale very sharply knowing this familiar sound--

01:31:54.930 --> 01:32:02.555
This is not the first hornet's nest you've stepped
into. Thankfully, a moment passes, no hornets. It

01:32:02.555 --> 01:32:10.546
was abandoned and had fallen from a tree. However,
you do hear a voice on the wall say, "Hello?"

01:32:10.546 --> 01:32:12.253
ASHLY: Shit.

01:32:12.253 --> 01:32:13.367
SAM: How far?

01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:17.320
MATT: About 70 feet from you.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.722
LIAM: I think we might be doing this now, so be
prepared for it.

01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:27.488
ASHLY: I don't want to put Frumpkin in danger, but
could we pretend it was Frumpkin, if he shoots out

01:32:27.488 --> 01:32:29.744
or something?

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:33.987
LIAM: Frumpkin shoots up into the air and bounces
off a tree.

01:32:33.987 --> 01:32:41.218
MATT: (hoots) "Oh, there you are again, you
sucker." He's going to raise a crossbow again.

01:32:41.218 --> 01:32:43.643
ASHLY: Oh no! Oh my god, if I kill someone again!

01:32:44.107 --> 01:32:46.790
(laughter)

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:51.176
MATT: That is a 13 to hit. What is Frumpkin's
armor class as an owl?

01:32:51.176 --> 01:32:55.486
LIAM: I have an owl here, it is-- That hits.

01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:57.433
ASHLY: Oh!

01:33:01.843 --> 01:33:02.810
SAM: Burch-icide!

01:33:03.266 --> 01:33:05.302
ASHLY: Shit!

01:33:05.302 --> 01:33:07.442
MATT: That is four points of piercing damage to
Frumpkin.

01:33:07.442 --> 01:33:08.781
LIAM: Frumpkin is alive!

01:33:08.781 --> 01:33:10.215
SAM: What?!

01:33:10.215 --> 01:33:12.943
MATT: How many hit points does the owl have?

01:33:12.943 --> 01:33:18.197
LIAM: Well, it's 1d4 plus one, and I rolled it
last time, and I rolled a four, so it's 1d4 plus one.

01:33:18.695 --> 01:33:28.201
MATT: So it's five? This owl takes a crossbow bolt
to the chest, and is like (flapping). You hear the

01:33:28.201 --> 01:33:43.051
same voice go, "Fucking hell! What-- Phil! I
fucking shot an owl, it's still flying! I hate

01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:51.422
"this forest! It's bullshit!" You hear this voice a
little further away go, "(laughing) You suck!"

01:33:51.694 --> 01:34:00.526
He's like, "Shut up!" Loads another bolt into it
and starts-- You see now is actively looking for

01:34:00.526 --> 01:34:04.117
the owl to finish it off and regain his pride.

01:34:04.117 --> 01:34:07.812
LIAM: I told him to go down low to the ground.
Yeah.

01:34:07.812 --> 01:34:11.341
MARISHA: Can you bring him back? I kind of want
that arrow.

01:34:11.341 --> 01:34:19.887
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I can, but I poof into Frumpkin's
senses. Do I hear anything besides Phil and

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:22.234
Mystery Man?

01:34:22.234 --> 01:34:23.778
MATT: Make a perception check with advantage.

01:34:23.778 --> 01:34:24.910
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, because of the hearing.

01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:26.230
MATT: Yeah.

01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:33.977
LIAM: Oh, that's good on the first roll. The first
roll is good, so it is 18.

01:34:33.977 --> 01:34:42.581
MATT: 18? Okay. Hearing the two men banter back
and forth a little bit, the errant prodding that

01:34:42.581 --> 01:34:52.759
Phil seems to be giving to this individual. Beyond
that, there's the crickets in the air, there's

01:34:52.759 --> 01:34:58.432
other nocturnal birds that are starting to rouse
from their slumber to go hunting for the night.

01:34:58.432 --> 01:35:04.236
From the direction of The Sour Nest, Frumpkin
glances up and can see, on the second floor, there

01:35:04.236 --> 01:35:10.544
are two openings you had seen previously on the
second floor of this fortress, on each side, and

01:35:10.544 --> 01:35:17.992
there appears to be a very faint bit of firelight,
and a shadow that passes by one, the other, so

01:35:17.992 --> 01:35:21.712
there is somebody moving on the second floor of
this--

01:35:21.712 --> 01:35:23.239
LIAM: Who's in the building?

01:35:23.239 --> 01:35:25.182
MATT: Of the inside of it, yes.

01:35:25.182 --> 01:35:30.707
LIAM: Okay. I snap my fingers, and Frumpkin
vanishes, leaving the bolt where he was, and then

01:35:30.707 --> 01:35:33.194
I do it again. He's here.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.671
MATT: All right. Very wounded, but alive.

01:35:35.671 --> 01:35:38.120
LIAM: May I borrow one of your goodberries?

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.659
SUMALEE: Absolutely.

01:35:39.659 --> 01:35:41.101
LIAM: Is this one? Okay.

01:35:41.101 --> 01:35:43.724
SUMALEE: You may take-- I believe there are four
or five left.

01:35:43.724 --> 01:35:44.719
LIAM: I will take four.

01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:45.622
SUMALEE: Please.

01:35:45.622 --> 01:35:52.531
LIAM: One, two, three, four. You may keep that
one. Thank you.

01:35:52.531 --> 01:35:55.505
MATT: Frumpkin happily eats from the goodberries.

01:35:55.505 --> 01:35:56.537
ASHLY: And he's better?

01:35:56.537 --> 01:36:03.821
MATT: Yeah, the wounds close slowly, the magic of
the goodberries healing the crossbow bolt over eventually.

01:36:04.278 --> 01:36:07.063
ASHLY: Oh, god. Sorry, guys.

01:36:07.063 --> 01:36:13.961
SAM: We can maybe use this. We could make a
distraction owl that he will focus on, and we

01:36:13.961 --> 01:36:16.646
could take him out from afar.

01:36:16.646 --> 01:36:21.315
MARISHA: Do you have an illusion that you can do
that? It's a good idea. Maybe we should've done

01:36:21.315 --> 01:36:23.164
that to begin with.

01:36:23.164 --> 01:36:27.283
LIAM: We could potentially keep moving now, if we
want to, because--

01:36:27.283 --> 01:36:29.211
ASHLY: We got the lay of the land?

01:36:29.211 --> 01:36:32.977
LIAM: Yeah, we know there's two on the wall, maybe
that's their M.O., every night there's two on the

01:36:32.977 --> 01:36:38.018
walls. People are awake inside. What is the hour
right now?

01:36:38.018 --> 01:36:41.910
MATT: I'd say at this point it's close to 10:30.

01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:44.649
LIAM: 10:33, yeah.

01:36:44.649 --> 01:36:48.393
TALIESIN: That's very specific.

01:36:48.393 --> 01:36:50.667
LIAM: Yeah, it is.

01:36:50.667 --> 01:36:53.671
TALIESIN: Are you just going for that, or is that
going to mean something?

01:36:53.671 --> 01:36:57.391
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, 10:34 now.

01:36:57.391 --> 01:37:00.672
TALIESIN: In a minute, it's going to be 10:35.

01:37:00.672 --> 01:37:01.910
LIAM: Yeah, approximately.

01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:02.659
TALIESIN: How about now?

01:37:02.659 --> 01:37:04.096
LIAM: It's still 10:34.

01:37:04.096 --> 01:37:05.442
TALIESIN: But it's closer to 10:35?

01:37:05.442 --> 01:37:12.960
LIAM: I'm not going to do this right now. We have
a decision to make. Doesn't seem any better or

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.296
worse from the outside, but we are outside the
onion. Are we going back to town to get a little

01:37:18.296 --> 01:37:24.654
more muscle, or are we making a go of it here?

01:37:24.654 --> 01:37:27.599
MARISHA: All right. Who votes for more muscle?
Let's put it to a vote.

01:37:27.599 --> 01:37:33.024
LIAM: Well, how successfully could we silently
kill these two on the wall? You would be good at one.

01:37:33.301 --> 01:37:39.303
SAM: Silently, we can kill these two, I think,
very easily. As long as you don't move.

01:37:39.303 --> 01:37:40.974
ASHLY: I won't. I'm staying right here.

01:37:40.974 --> 01:37:42.877
LIAM: But pitch it to me. How? You, I know--

01:37:42.877 --> 01:37:48.370
SAM: Can take this guy easily, if-- Do you fight
people from afar?

01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:51.100
TALIESIN: Not quietly.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:54.864
SAM: How about you, Nila? Do you have anything
that can shoot from afar?

01:37:54.864 --> 01:37:56.128
SUMALEE: Lightning, I told you.

01:37:56.128 --> 01:38:00.979
SAM: Well, something that's not like, "Hey, look,
we're here, we've got lightning!" Something--

01:38:00.979 --> 01:38:02.950
SUMALEE: Poison Spray.

01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:05.453
SAM: Okay. I mean, that's--

01:38:05.453 --> 01:38:08.912
SUMALEE: Ten feet. No, that's not from very far.

01:38:08.912 --> 01:38:16.831
SAM: We have Beau. She's quiet. I could distract
one while you go up and just (crack).

01:38:16.831 --> 01:38:19.779
MARISHA: How tall is the wall? How would I be able
to get on the wall?

01:38:19.779 --> 01:38:31.199
MATT: The wall is about 12 to 15 feet. It's not
terribly tall. It's about five feet wide.

01:38:31.199 --> 01:38:40.312
MARISHA: Are we walking the perimeter? If we're
doing a perimeter walk, I want to look and see if

01:38:40.312 --> 01:38:45.620
there are any branches and trees that might be
growing close to the wall, that I could--

01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.798
MATT: You do know, from previously looking over
it, that they've cleared out the forest about ten

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:53.524
feet from the outer wall specifically to prevent
anyone from climbing over into the space.

01:38:53.524 --> 01:38:55.254
SAM: I can shoot one with a crossbow.

01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:56.449
SUMALEE: I have a sling, too.

01:38:56.449 --> 01:38:57.315
SAM: Okay.

01:38:57.315 --> 01:39:00.070
LIAM: Yeah, but we have to finish the job
instantly.

01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:04.249
MARISHA: Yeah, we've got to do both at the same
time, ideally. There's got to be a team one and a

01:39:04.249 --> 01:39:11.871
team two on the guy. I've got my throwing darts,
but they're not super great.

01:39:11.871 --> 01:39:16.964
ASHLY: Your lightning, it doesn't make a storm
around it, right? It's just a lightning bolt. We couldn't--

01:39:17.522 --> 01:39:20.563
SAM: Controlled lightning?

01:39:20.563 --> 01:39:23.438
ASHLY: Make it seem like it's a storm, rather than
an attack.

01:39:23.438 --> 01:39:27.748
SAM: Well, listen, you can distract him with the
actual Frumpkin while I shoot. It doesn't have to

01:39:27.748 --> 01:39:31.857
be an illusory Frumpkin. I can still shoot.

01:39:31.857 --> 01:39:36.111
LIAM: Could also shoot him from the dark when he's
not expecting it to happen.

01:39:36.111 --> 01:39:38.037
SAM: That's true.

01:39:38.037 --> 01:39:42.786
MARISHA: Also, sometimes maybe it's just a stormy
night here in the forest.

01:39:42.786 --> 01:39:45.105
TALIESIN: This Phil must be a really bad person if
you're--

01:39:45.105 --> 01:39:49.862
ASHLY: Yeah, he's a real dick.

01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:52.248
SAM: Phil's the worst.

01:39:52.248 --> 01:39:54.276
ASHLY: Are they within eyesight of each other? I'm
assuming so.

01:39:54.276 --> 01:39:55.913
MATT: They are, yes.

01:39:55.913 --> 01:40:04.515
SAM: I can, if you guys-- I can shoot. I got a
shoot-y thing. I can shoot them.

01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:10.270
MARISHA: Okay, here's what I'm going to propose.
We split up: three on one guy, three on the other.

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:16.931
We'll do the plan that worked when we were doing
it on kids, and we didn't know we were doing it on

01:40:16.931 --> 01:40:23.630
kids. Me and you can throw up a bottle rocket.
That will be the signal. We attack both of the

01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:26.747
guys at the same time, two different sides.

01:40:26.747 --> 01:40:31.932
SAM: That's loud. We could just do Message. We can
send each other a message that's silent.

01:40:31.932 --> 01:40:35.315
MARISHA: But if it's loud, and they're both dead
afterwards.

01:40:35.315 --> 01:40:39.322
LIAM: No, the people inside will hear it. No, we
need silence.

01:40:39.322 --> 01:40:41.866
SUMALEE: I could create-- Oh, were you going to
say something?

01:40:41.866 --> 01:40:47.779
TALIESIN: I know I'm new here, and you've
obviously all got some kind of hierarchy going

01:40:47.779 --> 01:40:49.304
here of how you work this out.

01:40:49.304 --> 01:40:50.706
SAM: Caleb's in charge.

01:40:50.706 --> 01:41:02.379
TALIESIN: That makes sense. I suppose my question
would be: what are you really here for? Because

01:41:02.379 --> 01:41:07.415
normally, if I'm looking at a complicated problem,
I just think about what it is that I really want,

01:41:07.415 --> 01:41:10.216
and then I go and I do that.

01:41:10.216 --> 01:41:13.625
MARISHA: We want to murder everyone inside and
rescue the people who are trapped.

01:41:13.625 --> 01:41:15.611
SAM: We want to rescue the people who are
trapped.

01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:18.142
TALIESIN: Well, I was going to say that if you had
to put one above the other. If you get one thing,

01:41:18.142 --> 01:41:19.478
you get to do it.

01:41:19.478 --> 01:41:21.508
SAM: Rescue the people in the basement.

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:28.193
TALIESIN: So you've got to get in and out of the
basement. That seems to be the conversation then,

01:41:28.193 --> 01:41:32.272
is getting in and out of the basement. I'm sure,
inevitably, you're going to kill a whole bunch of

01:41:32.272 --> 01:41:36.991
people in the process of that, but as long as
you're focused on where you're going and what

01:41:36.991 --> 01:41:44.230
you're doing, that may help with this wanton
violence against Phil, who I'm sure is a terrible

01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:47.536
person. He shot an owl.

01:41:47.536 --> 01:41:49.334
SAM: Phil's friend did.

01:41:49.334 --> 01:41:51.539
ASHLY: He thought it was funny, though, so he's
still a dick.

01:41:51.539 --> 01:41:52.913
TALIESIN: No, that ain't funny.

01:41:52.913 --> 01:41:55.634
MARISHA: All right, let's split up, take these
guys out.

01:41:55.634 --> 01:41:57.854
LIAM: No, it's too early. We need to wait.

01:41:57.854 --> 01:41:59.796
MARISHA: Jesus!

01:41:59.796 --> 01:42:02.313
LIAM: It's 10:35 at night. We need to wait until
they're asleep.

01:42:02.313 --> 01:42:03.669
ASHLY: Call it 10:37 at this point.

01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:04.633
LIAM: No.

01:42:04.633 --> 01:42:06.280
MARISHA: We wait an hour and get into position.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.866
MATT: Okay. You guys wait an hour to get into
position.

01:42:08.866 --> 01:42:12.974
MARISHA: We watch the passing shadows in front of
the windows.

01:42:12.974 --> 01:42:16.008
MATT: Okay, you keep an out, and you do watch as
the two of them-- They're not perfectly in line

01:42:16.008 --> 01:42:20.104
with each other, and the second floor of the
complex does block their vision of each other when

01:42:20.104 --> 01:42:23.453
they are on complete opposite sides of the wall.
But sometimes one of them will be faster than the

01:42:23.453 --> 01:42:26.930
other, and they'll yell to the other, and they'll
go see each other from the opposite sides.

01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:29.004
LIAM: How far is Beauregard from me right now?

01:42:29.004 --> 01:42:30.548
MATT: How far is Beauregard from you right now?

01:42:30.548 --> 01:42:31.303
LIAM: Did you wander away from me?

01:42:31.303 --> 01:42:33.149
MARISHA: No, I'm right next to you.

01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:36.093
LIAM: (whispers) Would you rather wait until they
are sleeping in their beds before we did this?

01:42:36.093 --> 01:42:41.523
MARISHA: Yeah. I was just trying to move things
along.

01:42:41.523 --> 01:42:45.098
LIAM: I don't want this one moving along right
now. She makes a lot of noise.

01:42:45.098 --> 01:42:46.050
ASHLY: Sorry.

01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:48.785
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll wait. We'll just wait an
hour.

01:42:48.785 --> 01:42:54.101
ASHLY: That's a good question. I'm probably going
to ruin any stealthiness.

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:58.924
MATT: You do know, from the time that you've spent
here, that there is no point in which the place is

01:42:58.924 --> 01:43:01.787
unguarded from the wall.

01:43:01.787 --> 01:43:04.088
ASHLY: There's no point at which there is--

01:43:04.088 --> 01:43:11.631
MATT: Meaning there are shifts. The perimeter
sentinels that you see currently, there are

01:43:11.631 --> 01:43:15.763
usually two sets that switch off.

01:43:15.763 --> 01:43:17.613
ASHLY: Is there a time when they change?

01:43:17.613 --> 01:43:21.964
MATT: There is, but you're not entirely certain
when it was. You weren't really paying attention.

01:43:21.964 --> 01:43:23.759
SAM: You could take off your armor.

01:43:23.759 --> 01:43:28.005
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking, at least to
get into place, and then put it back on.

01:43:28.005 --> 01:43:29.502
MATT: It's a lot of armor.

01:43:29.502 --> 01:43:36.654
LIAM: If we are doing this, I feel we should wait
until it is late at night, and wait until we see

01:43:36.654 --> 01:43:43.546
those guards changed, and then wait a little bit
further for the old guards to go to sleep. Yeah?

01:43:43.546 --> 01:43:49.323
So there's a lot of sitting here and not moving. I
know we are all very anxious, but we wait, someone

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:55.233
comes out, relieves these two, they go to bed, and
then we strike all at once. Then we do your plan;

01:43:55.233 --> 01:43:57.130
it's just delayed, that's all.

01:43:57.130 --> 01:44:02.520
MARISHA: Okay. Until the next shift change. I
could use a short rest anyway.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:05.248
SAM: Get on different sides of the facility?

01:44:05.248 --> 01:44:06.668
MARISHA: I think so.

01:44:06.668 --> 01:44:09.178
LIAM: Yeah, but Keg, you stay here.

01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:10.604
ASHLY: And do what?

01:44:10.604 --> 01:44:12.035
LIAM: Wait.

01:44:12.035 --> 01:44:16.820
SAM: With two other people. We're splitting up so
we can take them both out at the same time.

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:23.577
LIAM: Yeah, you are just waiting until some of us
are able to silently take out these people on the

01:44:23.577 --> 01:44:27.946
wall. Then we buy ourselves a little time while
you can clink and clunk as we get closer.

01:44:27.946 --> 01:44:30.875
ASHLY: (laughs)

01:44:30.875 --> 01:44:36.793
LIAM: It's good that you find levity in the
situation. Then we go into the inside of this wall

01:44:36.793 --> 01:44:38.537
and take the next step.

01:44:38.537 --> 01:44:41.123
ASHLY: So it's not three and three, it's three and
two.

01:44:41.123 --> 01:44:44.433
LIAM: Well, it's two groups, and you move less
right now.

01:44:44.433 --> 01:44:47.650
ASHLY: Okay. Fair.

01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:50.598
MARISHA: Can I take a short rest?

01:44:50.598 --> 01:44:52.908
MATT: You guys can take a short rest.

01:44:52.908 --> 01:44:53.790
MARISHA: And we watch.

01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:54.962
MATT: And you watch.

01:44:54.962 --> 01:45:00.051
MARISHA: And we solidify our plan?

01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:09.356
MATT: Mercifully, depending on your intent, the
clouds break for a while and you have a clear,

01:45:09.356 --> 01:45:17.919
starry, moonlit sky overhead that manages to
create a rim-light on both the wall, the

01:45:17.919 --> 01:45:25.730
structure, and the two guards. And you wait. And
you wait. And we're going to take a break.

01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:29.691
LIAM: Thank goodness. I have to pee so bad.

01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:36.832
MATT: We'll come back here in a second. At this
point, might as well put the fortress out there,

01:45:36.832 --> 01:45:38.539
so that'll be waiting for you when you come back.

01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:40.996
LIAM: Let's go back to town.

01:45:40.996 --> 01:45:44.398
SUMALEE: You're a firbolg!

01:45:44.398 --> 01:45:51.046
MATT: You finally found him! We're going to go to
break here for a bit, but we have our giveaway at

01:45:51.046 --> 01:45:58.814
the break! For our fantastic giveaway tonight, we
have the purpleheart hero vault with the Celtic

01:45:58.814 --> 01:46:03.779
knot design on it, which is really pretty. It's
magnetized; open it up and you can put your dice;

01:46:03.779 --> 01:46:08.205
you can put your miniature in there. I'll be
giving this away at the end of the break, so hop

01:46:08.205 --> 01:46:14.909
on over to the Critical Role chat on Twitch.
That's twitch.tv/criticalrole and enter the key

01:46:14.909 --> 01:46:20.231
word once. More than once and you'll be
disqualified. The keyword tonight is "stronghold."

01:46:20.231 --> 01:46:26.665
One word: stronghold. All you people in the U.S.
and Canada, excluding Quebec, throw that into the

01:46:26.665 --> 01:46:31.937
chat and we'll come back with a winner as soon as
we return. See you in a few minutes!

01:46:31.937 --> 01:57:52.423
[break]

02:02:33.403 --> 02:02:35.251
ASHLY: Banana hammock

02:02:35.251 --> 02:02:38.741
MATT: A little late on the draw there, but that
worked out. That was awesome. Welcome back,

02:02:38.741 --> 02:02:44.214
everybody! Before we jump into this, we have our
winner of the fantastic purpleheart hero

02:02:44.214 --> 02:02:52.022
vault. That's going to be Elmosdaddy.
Congratulations, Elmosdaddy! We'll get your

02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:54.611
information and get that out to you ASAP.

02:02:54.611 --> 02:02:56.203
LIAM: (Elmo voice) Elmosdaddy!

02:02:56.203 --> 02:02:57.836
ASHLY: Sounds just the same. Is it the same
voice?

02:02:57.836 --> 02:02:59.319
LIAM: (Elmo voice) (giggling)

02:02:59.319 --> 02:03:08.418
MATT: To give you a little bit of a visual
representation of the size of the base of the fortress.

02:03:08.851 --> 02:03:10.484
LIAM: (Elmo voice) Everybody's going to die!

02:03:10.484 --> 02:03:16.586
MATT: That's what you see within the interior of
the courtyard. The wall itself resides probably

02:03:16.586 --> 02:03:18.539
about out here.

02:03:18.539 --> 02:03:19.699
SAM: This is inside the wall?

02:03:19.699 --> 02:03:20.738
MATT: This is inside the wall.

02:03:20.738 --> 02:03:21.833
SAM: Oh jeez.

02:03:21.833 --> 02:03:23.173
MATT: Above that, still--

02:03:23.173 --> 02:03:24.906
SAM: There's a second floor?

02:03:24.906 --> 02:03:26.643
MATT: There's a second floor.

02:03:26.643 --> 02:03:30.441
SAM: But it would be ridiculous to have built that
also.

02:03:30.441 --> 02:03:32.973
MARISHA: How are you lifting that?

02:03:32.973 --> 02:03:34.228
LIAM: He's got a little board under there.

02:03:34.228 --> 02:03:41.647
MATT: The second floor sits right about there. To
give a little bit of perspective on that. The

02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:47.706
black dots on the outside, by the way, are where
the windows are visible on the stone. You guys are

02:03:47.706 --> 02:03:55.936
currently divided on opposite ends of the outer
wall watching the two guards slowly move their way

02:03:55.936 --> 02:03:58.645
around the perimeter.

02:03:58.645 --> 02:04:00.939
MARISHA: Have they done a guard shift yet?

02:04:00.939 --> 02:04:02.719
MATT: Not yet.

02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:07.076
LIAM: In the interim while we're waiting for that
to happen, I'm going to do two things. One, I'm

02:04:07.076 --> 02:04:13.135
going to cast Mage Armor on myself, and I'm also
going to pull a book out of one of the holsters

02:04:13.135 --> 02:04:18.795
and spend ten minutes changing Frumpkin into a
<i>spider</i>!

02:04:18.795 --> 02:04:21.187
MATT: All righty.

02:04:21.187 --> 02:04:23.504
ASHLY: There aren't any windows on the bottom
floor at all?

02:04:23.504 --> 02:04:30.757
MATT: No. No windows in the bottom floor. There is
a front double door, and there is a single door in

02:04:30.757 --> 02:04:35.231
the back that you know leads into a kitchen.

02:04:35.231 --> 02:04:41.348
MARISHA: Go Charlotte, go! You're radiant!

02:04:41.348 --> 02:04:44.694
LIAM: He has three hit points, so I think he's
actually a bigger spider than the one you're

02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:48.204
imagining. See, he's right there. He's very big.

02:04:48.204 --> 02:04:49.517
MARISHA: How big is that spider?

02:04:49.517 --> 02:04:50.783
MATT: It's a pretty big spider.

02:04:50.783 --> 02:04:52.265
LIAM: It's three hit points worth of spider.

02:04:52.265 --> 02:04:54.395
MARISHA: That looks like a three hit point
spider.

02:04:54.395 --> 02:04:57.092
LIAM: Somebody could step on it and he could still
go.

02:04:57.092 --> 02:05:00.996
MATT: That's a four or five hitter.

02:05:00.996 --> 02:05:05.486
LIAM: Get Brian Foster in here with his ping pong
racket.

02:05:05.486 --> 02:05:11.177
MARISHA: That's arguably terrifying, I'll give it
to you. I was a little wrong, just a little.

02:05:11.177 --> 02:05:13.806
LIAM: I put it on Beau's shoulder.

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:20.924
MARISHA: I'm not terrified of it, I'm just saying
it could be terrifying. Hi, Frumpkin.

02:05:20.924 --> 02:05:25.895
MATT: Shortly after midnight, you watch as two
figures ascend from the inside of the wall

02:05:25.895 --> 02:05:31.041
climbing up different ladders that mark the
entrance and exit. They both interface in a brief

02:05:31.041 --> 02:05:37.599
conversation, hushed voices, and then relieve the
two previous guards, who then descend down on the

02:05:37.599 --> 02:05:46.442
inside of the courtyard via those same ladders and
disappear into The Sour Nest fortress. So there

02:05:46.442 --> 02:05:51.308
has been a guard changeover now. It's past
midnight, pushing one in the morning. What would

02:05:51.308 --> 02:05:52.864
you like to do?

02:05:52.864 --> 02:06:00.564
SAM: How are we split up, group-wise? Probably me
and Caleb split. And then--

02:06:00.564 --> 02:06:03.624
MARISHA: One firbolg each.

02:06:03.624 --> 02:06:05.686
SAM: I'll take the new one.

02:06:05.686 --> 02:06:07.367
MARISHA: We'll take the old one.

02:06:07.367 --> 02:06:08.347
SAM: Oh hey, look!

02:06:08.347 --> 02:06:10.732
MARISHA: Table and Table.

02:06:10.732 --> 02:06:17.326
SAM: While we're waiting I've asked the Deuce--

02:06:17.326 --> 02:06:21.491
TALIESIN: I'm already regretting the name.

02:06:21.491 --> 02:06:22.592
SAM: Are you married?

02:06:22.592 --> 02:06:23.790
TALIESIN: No.

02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:25.108
SAM: Did you go to college?

02:06:25.108 --> 02:06:26.117
TALIESIN: What?

02:06:26.117 --> 02:06:28.149
SAM: How old are you really?

02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:31.795
TALIESIN: I don't really know how to answer that
question.

02:06:31.795 --> 02:06:32.794
SAM: Do you have kids?

02:06:32.794 --> 02:06:33.547
TALIESIN: No.

02:06:33.547 --> 02:06:34.765
ASHLY: Why are you badgering him with questions?

02:06:34.765 --> 02:06:37.650
SAM: Well, he's a new friend and I talk when I'm
nervous.

02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:41.389
ASHLY: Why don't you let him think and answer
questions one at a time?

02:06:41.389 --> 02:06:42.765
SAM: You're right.

02:06:42.765 --> 02:06:44.202
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:06:44.202 --> 02:06:48.320
ASHLY: Sure, well, I'm learning from-- I don't
know who, actually. None of us are good at this.

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.869
Nila, I guess.

02:06:49.869 --> 02:06:52.476
SAM: Nila is really good at this; she's great.

02:06:52.476 --> 02:06:54.227
SUMALEE: What am I good at?

02:06:54.227 --> 02:07:00.612
MARISHA: I don't know I can only hear muffles.
Choice words. I think they're talking about you, though.

02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:02.535
SUMALEE: It's okay.

02:07:02.535 --> 02:07:08.487
LIAM: I pull the haversack off and say: I have a
decent idea, anyway. I think that you should use this.

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:09.812
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

02:07:12.972 --> 02:07:18.962
MATT: Much like how you spend a moment with your smell
bag, you watch as Beauregard seems to focus into

02:07:19.272 --> 02:07:26.147
this strange, vibrant pink satchel or shoulder bag
that Caleb has been carrying.

02:07:26.147 --> 02:07:28.095
SUMALEE: What is inside?

02:07:28.095 --> 02:07:35.277
MATT: About a minute passes before Beauregard
pulls back away, this strange trance passing over her.

02:07:38.777 --> 02:07:41.044
MARISHA: Death is weird, am I right?

02:07:41.044 --> 02:07:42.627
SUMALEE: What did you do to her?

02:07:42.627 --> 02:07:49.725
LIAM: Back to my idea, okay. Nott on the other
side can probably put a bolt in that guy's throat

02:07:49.725 --> 02:07:57.458
over there. You can probably vault up the side of
that wall, if I'm not mistaken, don't you think?

02:07:57.458 --> 02:07:58.928
MARISHA: How tall are you?

02:07:58.928 --> 02:08:03.559
SUMALEE: 7'2", maybe 7'6".

02:08:03.559 --> 02:08:07.835
MARISHA: Would you be willing to give me a boost
up that wall?

02:08:07.835 --> 02:08:08.748
SUMALEE: Absolutely.

02:08:08.748 --> 02:08:14.083
LIAM: Oh, you told me about your ability to make
things quiet around you.

02:08:14.083 --> 02:08:16.852
ASHLY: Damn, should've gone with Nila.

02:08:16.852 --> 02:08:21.259
SAM: You married? What kids do you have?

02:08:21.259 --> 02:08:26.600
ASHLY: I was married once. It lasted, like, an
hour.

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.270
TALIESIN: I bet it was a really good hour.

02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:34.020
ASHLY: Yeah, she sobered up and she said that she
made a mistake.

02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:41.726
LIAM: When I hold him, you yank him off of the
wall, and then Humpty Dumpty, you know, they can't

02:08:41.726 --> 02:08:43.391
put him back-- You know how it goes.

02:08:43.391 --> 02:08:44.234
MARISHA: Copy.

02:08:44.234 --> 02:08:47.610
SUMALEE: Wait, I'm sorry, I need that one more
time, but I'll get it.

02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:51.506
LIAM: You are going to help Beauregard here up
onto the wall, quietly, after you use your--

02:08:51.928 --> 02:08:52.891
SUMALEE: Pass Without a Trace.

02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:59.928
LIAM: Whatever you call it. Then she gets up there
and I am going to use my tricks to hold him and

02:08:59.928 --> 02:09:04.353
let her rip him off the wall and split his skull
upon the stones beneath.

02:09:04.353 --> 02:09:05.836
SUMALEE: Excellent.

02:09:05.836 --> 02:09:13.422
MARISHA: Also, the thing I was looking at, our
version of the smell bag. It's like this artifact

02:09:13.422 --> 02:09:19.553
that we got from an assassin that lets you look
into the creation of space and time and the universe.

02:09:19.553 --> 02:09:20.653
LIAM: Pretty complicated.

02:09:20.653 --> 02:09:21.354
MARISHA: Yeah

02:09:21.354 --> 02:09:22.518
SUMALEE: Wow.

02:09:22.518 --> 02:09:24.177
MARISHA: Anyway.

02:09:24.177 --> 02:09:29.080
LIAM: I pull out a little wire and whisper into it
to Nott and say: I think we have an idea over

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.510
here, so we should probably get set.

02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:33.435
ASHLY: We haven't come up with a plan yet.

02:09:33.435 --> 02:09:35.770
SAM: We'll get ready over here, give us one
second.

02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:39.520
ASHLY and SAM: How tall is our firbolg?

02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:45.611
TALIESIN: (singing) How tall is my firbolg? Seven
feet?

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:47.577
MATT: Seven to seven and a half feet.

02:09:47.577 --> 02:09:49.619
ASHLY: We could just copy their plan.

02:09:49.619 --> 02:09:51.269
SAM: I mean, I can just shoot.

02:09:51.269 --> 02:09:53.705
ASHLY: Oh, you can just shoot, never mind.

02:09:53.705 --> 02:09:58.624
SAM: If I miss, then backup plan is boost-y to
you?

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:01.114
ASHLY: Can you? I'm like 200 plus.

02:10:01.114 --> 02:10:02.720
TALIESIN: I'm not that strong.

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.893
LIAM: Well, she's a party maker, noise, you know.
(clanking)

02:10:06.893 --> 02:10:08.476
SAM: You can't shoot anything?

02:10:08.476 --> 02:10:10.195
TALIESIN: I can do some magic.

02:10:10.195 --> 02:10:11.123
ASHLY: I have javelins.

02:10:11.123 --> 02:10:12.397
SAM: Oh! You have a javelin.

02:10:12.397 --> 02:10:13.996
ASHLY: I forgot I had javelins. Yes, I have
javelins.

02:10:13.996 --> 02:10:17.267
SAM: I guess that's our Plan B, then.

02:10:17.267 --> 02:10:19.690
ASHLY: Didn't do too hot in the last one.

02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:27.871
SAM: Is there anything that either of you can do
to hold, silence, or assist me as I shoot this fellow?

02:10:28.304 --> 02:10:31.985
ASHLY: I could give you thumbs up as you're doing
it.

02:10:31.985 --> 02:10:36.033
SUMALEE: If I cast Pass Without a Trace, can it
help them, too?

02:10:36.033 --> 02:10:39.000
MATT: Unfortunately, you guys are on the opposite
sides of this.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.279
TALIESIN: I've got a Guiding Bolt, but it's very
bright and it's made of light.

02:10:42.279 --> 02:10:44.070
SAM: Let's not do that.

02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:46.884
TALIESIN: I have some insects, but they make a lot
of noise.

02:10:46.884 --> 02:10:52.974
SAM: Okay. It's fine. It's on me. It's okay. I'll
just get super drunk.

02:10:52.974 --> 02:10:56.769
TALIESIN: Actually, I have something I can do
while that's happening.

02:10:56.769 --> 02:10:58.270
LIAM: Matthew?

02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:59.038
MATT: Yes?

02:10:59.038 --> 02:11:04.103
LIAM: DM. where would you say, in relation to this
map, the two groups are?

02:11:04.103 --> 02:11:08.124
MATT: The two groups would be probably on the
outskirts of the wall here and here.

02:11:08.124 --> 02:11:10.792
LIAM: So 150 feet apart, probably.

02:11:10.792 --> 02:11:12.651
MATT: Quite a distance.

02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:14.903
MARISHA: How far does your Message work?

02:11:14.903 --> 02:11:17.111
LIAM: Like, about that far.

02:11:17.111 --> 02:11:20.307
MARISHA: So we wouldn't be out a Message range of
each other.

02:11:20.307 --> 02:11:22.330
SAM: Message is 120 feet.

02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:23.736
MATT: About 120 feet.

02:11:23.736 --> 02:11:25.762
LIAM: Ayy!

02:11:25.762 --> 02:11:33.846
MARISHA: When I get up there and grab him, I'm
going to bash his head in and I'm going to throw

02:11:33.846 --> 02:11:37.442
him down, and if he's still alive, you get him.

02:11:37.442 --> 02:11:39.093
SUMALEE: With my shillelagh!

02:11:39.093 --> 02:11:41.633
MARISHA and SUMALEE: (grunting)

02:11:41.633 --> 02:11:45.906
MATT: We'll say you can manage to adjust
yourselves to get within range.

02:11:45.906 --> 02:11:50.850
LIAM: When you get on the wall off of Nila's
shoulders and you do the handhold thing? You know

02:11:50.850 --> 02:11:52.846
what I'm talking about?

02:11:52.846 --> 02:12:00.550
MARISHA: I was figuring I would be on her
shoulders and we would suck up against the wall.

02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:03.049
SAM: I take out a piece of wire and send a little
Message.

02:12:03.049 --> 02:12:04.474
LIAM: Right underneath him?

02:12:04.474 --> 02:12:06.309
MARISHA: We'll see, yeah. Right underneath him.

02:12:06.309 --> 02:12:14.044
SAM: Caleb! Provided this plan works, after we
knock down the folks, someone on each party should

02:12:14.044 --> 02:12:20.877
put on their cloak and resume their guard pattern
and keep walking around the wall.

02:12:20.877 --> 02:12:23.008
SUMALEE: Very sneaky.

02:12:23.008 --> 02:12:24.561
LIAM: That is an excellent idea.

02:12:24.561 --> 02:12:26.873
SAM: You can respond-- oh, you did.

02:12:26.873 --> 02:12:32.532
LIAM: Yeah. You and I, we're good. We have this
little routine. Beauregard can do that on this

02:12:32.532 --> 02:12:36.744
side. What about on your side? You? You're short.

02:12:36.744 --> 02:12:37.765
MARISHA: Keg.

02:12:37.765 --> 02:12:39.235
LIAM and SAM: She's short.

02:12:39.235 --> 02:12:40.814
MARISHA: But not as short as Nott.

02:12:40.814 --> 02:12:42.094
TALIESIN: You could stand on top of me.

02:12:42.094 --> 02:12:43.526
ASHLY: Are these guys humans, these guards?

02:12:43.526 --> 02:12:47.359
MATT: Make a perception check. (yawns) Pardon me.

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:50.102
ASHLY: 20, baby!

02:12:50.102 --> 02:12:58.534
MATT: One of them is human, though maybe 5 1/2
feet tall. The other, because of the moonlight

02:12:58.534 --> 02:13:06.590
that's coming through, you have a better
perspective on him, even at this distance, you

02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:13.898
guess probably half-elven or just a very thin
human. A little over 6-foot. So you have a 6-foot

02:13:13.898 --> 02:13:16.157
one and one that's 5 1/2 feet.

02:13:16.157 --> 02:13:21.093
SAM: Maybe firbolg could hunch over and stalk
around.

02:13:21.093 --> 02:13:29.174
SUMALEE: As a firbolg, you have the ability, no,
to disguise yourself? Every firbolg does, to

02:13:29.174 --> 02:13:31.718
shrink a little bit if you want.

02:13:31.718 --> 02:13:34.057
SAM: She says to Caleb, who tells me, who tells
him.

02:13:34.057 --> 02:13:36.805
SUMALEE: Sorry!

02:13:36.805 --> 02:13:38.847
MARISHA: Pass it along!

02:13:38.847 --> 02:13:41.388
TALIESIN: Yeah, I guess I can do that.

02:13:41.388 --> 02:13:42.554
SAM: Okay!

02:13:42.554 --> 02:13:44.569
ASHLY: I'm very strong, I could maybe hoist you.

02:13:44.569 --> 02:13:47.180
SAM: Oh! Yes! See, you've got a plan, now!

02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:48.759
ASHLY: We made up a plan, too!

02:13:48.759 --> 02:13:50.982
LIAM: What are you doing over there, Nott?

02:13:50.982 --> 02:13:59.829
SAM: We're going to shoot the man and then drunky,
smoky Keg is going to pick up The Deuce and he's

02:13:59.829 --> 02:14:00.843
going to walk around--

02:14:00.843 --> 02:14:02.681
ASHLY: Is my nickname Drunky, Smoky Keg?!

02:14:02.681 --> 02:14:04.996
SAM: We're working on a better one.

02:14:04.996 --> 02:14:08.690
ASHLY: It's not even a nickname; it's three times
longer than my normal name! How about Keg?! My

02:14:08.690 --> 02:14:10.387
normal name!

02:14:10.387 --> 02:14:13.039
TALIESIN: It's literally one syllable. I feel like
that's not a lot to ask.

02:14:13.039 --> 02:14:18.401
LIAM: Nott, I have a question for you. The plan is
not foolproof, but on our side over here,

02:14:18.401 --> 02:14:26.361
Beauregard's going to throw the asshole off the
wall. If you shoot your asshole and he does not

02:14:26.361 --> 02:14:30.414
die but starts screaming, what do you do?

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:35.604
SAM: Other than shoot him again. We have a javelin
and that is all we've got.

02:14:35.604 --> 02:14:43.879
ASHLY: I have rope, so I could tie the rope around
the javelin, (shoonk!), and pull him off the wall.

02:14:43.879 --> 02:14:46.110
MARISHA: Makeshift harpoon? That's pretty cool.

02:14:46.110 --> 02:14:47.793
SAM: Sure, let's do it!

02:14:47.793 --> 02:14:49.431
ASHLY: Is that now a leading plan?

02:14:49.431 --> 02:14:52.882
SAM: No, I'm still going to shoot and you're going
to be ready with jav.

02:14:52.882 --> 02:14:55.492
LIAM: Or you could attack at the same time.

02:14:55.492 --> 02:14:56.708
ASHLY: That's true.

02:14:56.708 --> 02:14:57.583
LIAM: Said Liam.

02:14:57.583 --> 02:14:59.377
MARISHA: Let's just do this. Come on.

02:14:59.377 --> 02:15:02.260
ASHLY: Okay, I tie the rope around the javelin.

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:06.113
SAM: You message me a countdown and I'll say it
out loud to you.

02:15:06.113 --> 02:15:08.362
ASHLY: I'm very scared.

02:15:08.362 --> 02:15:11.330
MARISHA: We're going to wait for our guys to
pace--

02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:16.588
LIAM: Yeah, the sequence of events is that you two
need to get onto the wall successfully.

02:15:16.588 --> 02:15:18.527
MARISHA: Uh-huh, with Pass Without a Trace.

02:15:18.527 --> 02:15:19.973
LIAM: You've got your javelin tied up.

02:15:19.973 --> 02:15:21.140
ASHLY: It's ready, it's roped.

02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:23.885
MATT: Battle-optimal position.

02:15:23.885 --> 02:15:26.438
SAM and MARISHA: They're here.

02:15:26.438 --> 02:15:27.716
LIAM: I say three, two, one.

02:15:27.716 --> 02:15:28.962
MARISHA: Go, Pass without a Trace!

02:15:28.962 --> 02:15:30.179
SAM: Three, two, one, go!

02:15:30.179 --> 02:15:32.630
LIAM: No! Are they in place?

02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:33.739
MARISHA: We're going.

02:15:33.739 --> 02:15:35.209
SUMALEE: She's on my shoulders.

02:15:35.209 --> 02:15:38.714
MARISHA: I'm on her shoulders, I'm up against this
fucking wall! You're doing this, I'm going to try

02:15:38.714 --> 02:15:40.414
and (grunt)--

02:15:40.414 --> 02:15:42.033
ASHLY: Then we're shooting at the same time?

02:15:42.033 --> 02:15:43.223
SAM: We're shooting at the same time.

02:15:43.223 --> 02:15:47.110
LIAM: I'm going to hold Hold Person until these
two are right under the guard.

02:15:47.110 --> 02:15:53.069
MARISHA: I want to wait until right after he
passes, and then I want to do some ninja stuff.

02:15:53.069 --> 02:15:55.464
SAM: Are you just sipping tea?

02:15:55.464 --> 02:15:56.267
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:15:56.267 --> 02:16:03.275
MATT: First, I need you to make a stealth check
because you're having to move right up against the

02:16:03.275 --> 02:16:04.945
wall. This is a ten-foot clearing.

02:16:04.945 --> 02:16:05.542
MARISHA: I do.

02:16:05.542 --> 02:16:07.533
LIAM: Use the dodeca if you need to.

02:16:07.533 --> 02:16:08.826
MARISHA: That's true.

02:16:08.826 --> 02:16:10.574
MATT: Both of you guys roll stealth checks.

02:16:10.574 --> 02:16:11.335
MARISHA: Mmm.

02:16:11.335 --> 02:16:14.541
SUMALEE: Doesn't she get a plus ten to the
stealth?

02:16:14.541 --> 02:16:15.841
MATT: It is a plus ten to stealth check.

02:16:15.841 --> 02:16:20.073
MARISHA: Then that gives me a 20 total. Okay, 20.

02:16:20.113 --> 02:16:22.479
SUMALEE: Oh shit, how did I get the same thing?
Look.

02:16:22.752 --> 02:16:23.657
MARISHA: I cursed you!

02:16:23.657 --> 02:16:24.908
SAM: You need to stealth too?

02:16:24.908 --> 02:16:26.200
LIAM: Luck, you have luck still.

02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:27.768
MATT: What's your total?

02:16:27.768 --> 02:16:29.728
ASHLY: Does that apply to her, the Pass without a
Trace?

02:16:29.728 --> 02:16:31.007
LIAM and MATT: Yeah.

02:16:31.007 --> 02:16:33.613
LIAM: But you have a luck left.

02:16:33.613 --> 02:16:35.857
SUMALEE: I have two luck points left, but I feel
like--

02:16:35.857 --> 02:16:37.899
MATT: No, you have one because you used one last
game.

02:16:37.899 --> 02:16:39.212
ASHLY: But we short rested, didn't we?

02:16:39.212 --> 02:16:40.103
SUMALEE: Oh, we rested.

02:16:40.103 --> 02:16:41.677
MATT: It's a long rest to come back.

02:16:41.677 --> 02:16:42.644
LIAM: You got one left.

02:16:42.644 --> 02:16:43.672
ASHLY: Farts.

02:16:43.672 --> 02:16:45.436
SUMALEE: I think I need to hold that.

02:16:45.436 --> 02:16:52.801
MATT: So 15 and 20? You're throwing a javelin and
you're firing.

02:16:52.801 --> 02:16:53.286
SAM: Yeah.

02:16:53.286 --> 02:16:54.121
ASHLY: Okay.

02:16:54.121 --> 02:17:01.451
MATT: You both run up to the wall. You go ahead
and hoist up, hanging on the edge right there.

02:17:01.451 --> 02:17:03.746
Walks past, doesn't seem to have noticed the both
of you.

02:17:03.746 --> 02:17:07.757
SUMALEE and MARISHA: Woo!

02:17:07.757 --> 02:17:17.681
MATT: Rolled a six on his perception. Would you
both make your attack rolls, please? Because you

02:17:17.681 --> 02:17:20.071
are unseen, you have advantage on the attack.

02:17:20.071 --> 02:17:21.078
ASHLY: On three?

02:17:21.078 --> 02:17:28.552
LIAM: No, Caleb, seeing this, would've went <i>drei,
zwei, eins</i>. Hold Person.

02:17:28.552 --> 02:17:32.260
ASHLY: That is a 15.

02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:34.934
MATT: That just hits.

02:17:34.934 --> 02:17:37.060
SAM: Natural 20.

02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:38.265
ASHLY: Hell yes!

02:17:38.265 --> 02:17:41.803
SAM: But you said advantage. So that was a three.

02:17:41.803 --> 02:17:46.199
MATT: It was with advantage. Roll again just in
case you want to crit.

02:17:46.199 --> 02:17:47.415
ASHLY: A one, no.

02:17:47.415 --> 02:17:52.661
MATT: No, not at all. Let's roll your sneak attack
damage and double it on top because it's a crit,

02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:54.047
and then take another shot.

02:17:54.047 --> 02:17:55.180
LIAM: Take a shot!

02:17:55.180 --> 02:18:00.425
SAM: 24 so far.

02:18:00.425 --> 02:18:05.345
MATT: 24 points of damage from the first attack.
Go ahead and roll damage for the javelin.

02:18:05.345 --> 02:18:06.258
ASHLY: Five.

02:18:06.258 --> 02:18:14.380
MATT: It's 29 damage. As you throw the javelin up,
you get your shot, the next attack.

02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:15.183
SAM: 24.

02:18:15.183 --> 02:18:18.483
MATT: Roll damage for that one.

02:18:18.483 --> 02:18:18.999
SAM: Nine.

02:18:18.999 --> 02:18:27.067
MATT: You watch as-- (multiple impacts)-- and you
yank back. Make a strength check.

02:18:27.067 --> 02:18:28.431
SAM: Come on!

02:18:28.431 --> 02:18:31.532
ASHLY: No whammies. Ten?

02:18:31.532 --> 02:18:37.095
MATT: (thud) You're dragging the corpse.

02:18:37.095 --> 02:18:37.884
LIAM: Ten.

02:18:37.884 --> 02:18:43.190
ALL: Ten!

02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:50.709
MATT: Hand-over-hand, you're dragging the corpse.
He insta-dies, and then got pulled off and then

02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:56.781
slammed onto the ground and is now being pulled
through the dirt and grass. Done, instantly. For

02:18:56.781 --> 02:18:58.577
you, it's a wisdom saving throw.

02:18:58.577 --> 02:18:59.505
LIAM: 16.

02:18:59.505 --> 02:19:02.929
MATT: A natural 12 plus one, that's 13, it's a
fail.

02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:04.208
LIAM: Oh, held!

02:19:04.208 --> 02:19:04.974
MARISHA: He's held?

02:19:04.974 --> 02:19:06.151
MATT: Yes.

02:19:06.151 --> 02:19:16.047
MARISHA: As soon that I see that he's held, I am
going to jump up and try and grab him by the pants

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:19.014
and bash his head in and then throw him down.

02:19:19.014 --> 02:19:24.394
MATT: Easy enough to do. Go ahead and make a
martial arts attack. Technically, you have

02:19:24.394 --> 02:19:26.295
advantage because he's paralyzed.

02:19:26.295 --> 02:19:30.044
MARISHA: Okay. Just a straight attack?

02:19:30.044 --> 02:19:30.669
MATT: Yep.

02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:35.639
MARISHA: Okay. 16? No, sorry, 15?

02:19:35.639 --> 02:19:43.702
MATT: That hits, it's an auto-crit because he's
held. Roll your martial arts damage.

02:19:43.702 --> 02:19:52.303
MARISHA: Aw, I rolled a one. Plus two, plus four.
Six damage.

02:19:52.303 --> 02:19:58.476
MATT: Six damage. You throw him to the ground. He
falls and takes an additional five points of

02:19:58.476 --> 02:20:04.332
bludgeoning damage. After the fall, hits the
ground-- off the wall, on the backside of it, he's

02:20:04.332 --> 02:20:06.318
now face down on the ground, still held.

02:20:06.318 --> 02:20:08.020
MARISHA: I go: Nila, now!

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:14.914
SUMALEE: I take my shillelagh and just let him
have it (grunt).

02:20:14.914 --> 02:20:17.984
MATT: Are you continuing your attack with her or
are you hanging, staying up on the wall?

02:20:17.984 --> 02:20:25.524
MARISHA: I will finish my attack right as she
whacks her staff. I'm going to let go and try and

02:20:25.524 --> 02:20:29.302
time it to where I land on the staff with her.

02:20:29.302 --> 02:20:33.467
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and swing the attack. You
have advantage because he's paralyzed and prone.

02:20:33.467 --> 02:20:34.754
SUMALEE: Okay, this is this.

02:20:34.754 --> 02:20:38.356
MATT: Yep. Go ahead and roll that twice and take
the higher, adding your wisdom modifier.

02:20:42.856 --> 02:20:47.950
SUMALEE: Ten plus four, so 14.

02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:50.860
MATT: Plus your proficiency modifier, which is
plus three, so it would be--

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:51.892
SUMALEE: 17.

02:20:51.892 --> 02:20:55.844
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll your damage.
Should be a--

02:20:55.844 --> 02:20:58.174
SUMALEE: Which is 1d8.

02:20:58.174 --> 02:21:02.986
MATT: d8 plus four. But d8 times two because it's
critical.

02:21:02.986 --> 02:21:05.750
ASHLY: Come on, Nila.

02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:12.870
MATT: Well, it's-- oh, that's fine, we'll do that.
So that's nine-- add the two together-- it's nine

02:21:13.128 --> 02:21:19.064
plus four. So 13 points of damage on top of that.
Right as you're slamming down, go ahead and make

02:21:19.064 --> 02:21:20.045
your next attack.

02:21:20.045 --> 02:21:23.370
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, 23.

02:21:23.370 --> 02:21:27.766
MATT: With advantage, these are with advantage
because he's paralyzed and prone.

02:21:27.766 --> 02:21:28.405
MARISHA: 23.

02:21:28.405 --> 02:21:30.239
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage, crit.

02:21:30.239 --> 02:21:37.495
MARISHA: That's much better. Eight plus four, so
12 damage.

02:21:37.495 --> 02:21:41.945
MATT: 12 points of damage. Yeah, that'll do it.

02:21:41.945 --> 02:21:43.051
ASHLY: Fuck yes!

02:21:43.051 --> 02:21:54.347
MATT: Both of them-- one was enjoying the wind and
then darkness forever. The other got a cramp and

02:21:54.347 --> 02:21:58.981
then got bludgeoned from all sides after being
jammed in the dirt and then expired.

02:21:58.981 --> 02:22:04.761
ASHLY: "Was enjoying the wind and then darkness
forever." Aw, that's so sad! Was it Phil?

02:22:04.761 --> 02:22:07.402
MATT: It was the end of The Sopranos for them,
man. It was just--

02:22:07.402 --> 02:22:12.547
ASHLY: Phil's asleep, Phil went to bed. It
switched, Phil's still alive. We should only leave

02:22:12.547 --> 02:22:14.552
Phil alive if we can, just save Phil.

02:22:14.552 --> 02:22:15.822
MATT: Hashtag save Phil.

02:22:15.822 --> 02:22:19.522
SUMALEE: Phil is bad!

02:22:19.522 --> 02:22:28.056
MATT: They are both done at the moment, it is
silent. There is a very slight sound of both their

02:22:28.056 --> 02:22:33.904
bodies impacting in the dirt, but you're not sure
if that managed to reach as far as anybody within

02:22:33.904 --> 02:22:36.525
the interior of the stronghold. What do you do now
in this moment?

02:22:36.525 --> 02:22:44.530
SAM: Mr. Deuce, put on this cloak, if you don't
mind, and climb up onto there and patrol around,

02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:45.407
if you don't mind.

02:22:45.407 --> 02:22:46.590
TALIESIN: This Deuce thing's weird, I don't--

02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:48.021
SAM: Mr. Clay!

02:22:48.021 --> 02:22:51.231
MARISHA: I do the same thing. I slip into the
guard uniform.

02:22:51.231 --> 02:22:56.500
TALIESIN: Do you think maybe we're going to want
some of these clothes at some point?

02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.298
SAM: You can put his cloak on right now.

02:22:58.298 --> 02:23:02.333
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm really tall, but all right. I'm
also going to take a look at this guy they just

02:23:02.333 --> 02:23:07.359
killed and commit his face and what he's wearing
to memory, just to put it in there.

02:23:07.359 --> 02:23:08.451
MATT: Cool, no worries.

02:23:08.451 --> 02:23:12.453
ASHLY: Then I'm going to hoist you up on top? Or
can you make it there yourself?

02:23:12.453 --> 02:23:14.003
TALIESIN: How tall is the--?

02:23:14.003 --> 02:23:18.535
MATT: It's about 12 feet. You might want to help
him; he's not the strongest person. Just make a

02:23:18.535 --> 02:23:21.143
strength check. It's not too difficult.

02:23:21.667 --> 02:23:23.217
ASHLY: A million. 24.

02:23:23.217 --> 02:23:27.670
MATT: Yeah. You (grunt)-- you get on top of the
wall, you have the cloak on.

02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:31.533
TALIESIN: I'm going to rope down really quick,
quietly, keeping an eye out.

02:23:31.533 --> 02:23:32.400
SAM: Ooh, nice.

02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:33.907
MARISHA: Would you mind giving me another boost
real quick?

02:23:33.907 --> 02:23:35.207
SUMALEE: Not a problem at all.

02:23:35.207 --> 02:23:42.071
MATT: Between your acrobatics and your ability,
your height, without an issue, you get to the top.

02:23:42.071 --> 02:23:47.256
You guys now are on top of the wall, cloaked.
Where do you want to go?

02:23:47.256 --> 02:23:49.909
MARISHA: I look over at Deuce and give a nod.

02:23:49.909 --> 02:23:54.295
TALIESIN: You said that out of game and I can't
say anything about it.

02:23:54.295 --> 02:23:58.919
LIAM: I send Frumpkin up into the air to do a
circle around the entire perimeter.

02:23:58.919 --> 02:24:00.847
MATT: Perception check with advantage please.

02:24:00.847 --> 02:24:04.665
ASHLY: Does this mean that they can see in the
windows on the second story now?

02:24:04.665 --> 02:24:06.540
MATT: If they want to they can try.

02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:10.012
LIAM: <i>Achtzehn</i>. 18.

02:24:10.012 --> 02:24:15.699
MATT: Okay. There does not appear to be any person
in the courtyard. Those two guards are the only

02:24:15.699 --> 02:24:21.746
two that were currently set on the outside. You
can see the horses that were pulling the carts

02:24:21.746 --> 02:24:27.009
that are set over on the side at the moment. You
can see the carts that have since been repaired

02:24:27.009 --> 02:24:32.793
and are currently waiting in rest. You can see the
front door to the stronghold, and you can see the

02:24:32.793 --> 02:24:33.887
back door.

02:24:33.887 --> 02:24:42.563
LIAM: Frumpkin saw all of this, yeah? Saw the
doors, all of that? I'm going to creep my way to

02:24:42.563 --> 02:24:46.113
the front door and as I go, I'm going to cast
Detect Magic.

02:24:46.113 --> 02:24:47.949
MATT: You're still on the outside of the wall.

02:24:47.949 --> 02:24:48.540
LIAM: Yeah.

02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:51.671
MATT: You have to make your way through the
perimeter of the wall, which has its own front

02:24:51.671 --> 02:24:53.495
gate, which is closed. Do you want to head to
that?

02:24:53.495 --> 02:24:54.938
LIAM: Right, to the outer wall.

02:24:54.938 --> 02:24:58.318
MATT: The outer wall and out that way, okay. Cast
Detect Magic?

02:24:58.318 --> 02:25:03.843
LIAM: Yeah. I will wait until I am within 30 feet
of the wall and then I do so, I will mutter a few words.

02:25:04.396 --> 02:25:08.016
TALIESIN: I get a free Disguise Self that doesn't
actually count against any of my slots.

02:25:08.016 --> 02:25:08.944
MATT: Correct.

02:25:08.944 --> 02:25:09.619
LIAM: Sexy.

02:25:09.619 --> 02:25:14.431
TALIESIN: I'm going to be a guard. I'm going to be
the guy we just snuffed.

02:25:14.431 --> 02:25:15.869
MATT: Easy enough to do.

02:25:15.869 --> 02:25:17.057
LIAM: I like this guy.

02:25:17.057 --> 02:25:18.657
TALIESIN: That's cool, I haven't done this.

02:25:18.657 --> 02:25:25.481
MATT: As you give the Deuce your nod, you watch as
his form actually shifts smaller and matches the

02:25:25.481 --> 02:25:26.936
shape of the previous guard.

02:25:26.936 --> 02:25:28.163
SAM: Mr. Clay!

02:25:28.163 --> 02:25:29.952
ASHLY: Cool trick!

02:25:29.952 --> 02:25:37.774
MATT: Finishing your Detect Magic, you do not
detect anything magical of the outer gate. It is locked.

02:25:37.774 --> 02:25:41.947
ASHLY: Are we going in together? Should we do back
entrance/front entrance?

02:25:41.947 --> 02:25:45.232
MARISHA: I can unlock the front entrance for you
guys.

02:25:45.232 --> 02:25:50.584
LIAM: I take my wire and I say: Nott are you on
the ground still? Can you meet me at the front

02:25:50.584 --> 02:25:51.990
gates quietly?

02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:56.918
SAM: Yeah, give us a minute. I am going to rifle
through the dude's pockets and go through the guy

02:25:56.918 --> 02:25:58.767
we just killed's stuff.

02:25:58.767 --> 02:26:02.753
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check, because
you're doing this quickly.

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:03.408
SAM: 15.

02:26:03.408 --> 02:26:04.322
MATT: 15? Not too bad.

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:06.202
MARISHA: Do we want to go front entrance/back
entrance?

02:26:06.202 --> 02:26:08.188
MATT: You manage to pilfer about 62 gold pieces.

02:26:08.188 --> 02:26:09.408
SAM: 62?!

02:26:09.408 --> 02:26:09.923
MATT: Yes.

02:26:09.923 --> 02:26:11.616
SAM: Why is he so rich?!

02:26:11.616 --> 02:26:16.009
MATT: Because you caught him at the moment outside
of the town and he had his money on him.

02:26:16.009 --> 02:26:21.571
SAM: But does he have anything else useful, like
keys?

02:26:21.571 --> 02:26:23.434
MATT: No keys on him, no.

02:26:23.434 --> 02:26:28.346
MARISHA: Yeah, make sure we get the gold out of
our dude's pockets, you're right there on the ground.

02:26:28.828 --> 02:26:30.307
SAM: Okay, cool. Anything else?

02:26:30.307 --> 02:26:31.552
MATT: He felt safe on that wall.

02:26:31.552 --> 02:26:33.424
SAM: Anything else useful? No.

02:26:33.424 --> 02:26:38.953
MATT: The crossbow that he had seems to have
snapped in the process of his body being yanked

02:26:38.953 --> 02:26:42.915
from the top of the wall. His armor is standard
leather armor.

02:26:42.915 --> 02:26:44.752
SAM: Okay, great.

02:26:44.752 --> 02:26:49.079
MARISHA: Is there anything on the dude's armor
that I put on?

02:26:49.079 --> 02:26:52.510
MATT: You didn't stop to check, you're already up
on the wall.

02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:54.640
SUMALEE: I can check.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.888
MATT: If you want to. Make an investigation
check.

02:26:56.888 --> 02:27:03.186
SUMALEE: 17, what do I add?

02:27:03.186 --> 02:27:04.739
MARISHA: Investigation.

02:27:04.739 --> 02:27:06.544
SUMALEE and MARISHA: Minus one.

02:27:06.544 --> 02:27:07.566
SUMALEE: 16.

02:27:07.566 --> 02:27:13.535
MATT: 16, okay. You find 22 gold pieces.

02:27:13.535 --> 02:27:17.059
SUMALEE: Added to my ten, that seems like a lot.

02:27:17.059 --> 02:27:22.927
MATT: And a pack of crossbow bolts, 16 crossbow
bolts.

02:27:22.927 --> 02:27:25.420
SAM: Totally useful.

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.555
LIAM: Waiting very anxiously for my life partner.

02:27:27.555 --> 02:27:33.358
SAM: Oh! Yes, let's go! Oh, not you. You stay up
there. Let's go, but be stealthy.

02:27:33.358 --> 02:27:36.849
MATT: I'd like you both to roll stealth check with
disadvantage.

02:27:36.849 --> 02:27:39.602
SAM: Wait, with advantage?

02:27:39.602 --> 02:27:42.994
MATT: Disadvantage for her because of her armor.

02:27:42.994 --> 02:27:44.962
LIAM: Oh, son of a fuck, come on Ash.

02:27:44.962 --> 02:27:46.126
SAM and LIAM: Okay.

02:27:46.126 --> 02:27:48.376
LIAM: Don't go lower than that, that's got to be
the worst.

02:27:48.376 --> 02:27:51.442
SAM: That was the worst. Still not great.

02:27:51.442 --> 02:27:54.046
ASHLY: This is the worst?

02:27:54.046 --> 02:27:54.797
SAM: No.

02:27:54.797 --> 02:27:55.843
LIAM: Seven plus--

02:27:55.843 --> 02:27:56.988
ASHLY: Seven plus five.

02:27:56.988 --> 02:27:58.984
MATT: Okay, 12, good to know.

02:27:58.984 --> 02:28:00.937
MARISHA: I say: Meet at the front gate.

02:28:00.937 --> 02:28:01.908
SUMALEE: Okay.

02:28:01.908 --> 02:28:05.624
MATT: You're going stealth as well? Roll a stealth
check. please.

02:28:05.624 --> 02:28:08.559
ASHLY: Oh god, why'd I get plate armor?

02:28:08.559 --> 02:28:12.193
MARISHA: I think you still have Pass Without a
Trace on.

02:28:12.193 --> 02:28:14.311
MATT: You do, so that's plus ten.

02:28:14.311 --> 02:28:16.260
SUMALEE: Oh, thank goodness. Thank you.

02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:18.096
MARISHA: Lasts for like ten minutes, I think.

02:28:18.096 --> 02:28:19.086
SUMALEE: 14

02:28:19.086 --> 02:28:20.378
MARISHA: Lasts for an hour?

02:28:20.378 --> 02:28:23.538
SUMALEE and MATT: Up to an hour.

02:28:23.538 --> 02:28:25.805
SUMALEE: Okay, so this is four plus ten.

02:28:25.805 --> 02:28:36.726
MATT: Okay. Eventually, the four of you meet
towards the front gate, seemingly, from what you

02:28:36.726 --> 02:28:38.444
can tell, no one's noticed.

02:28:38.866 --> 02:28:43.698
TALIESIN: From my vantage point, I'm going to see
if there's anybody in the courtyard, or if there's

02:28:43.698 --> 02:28:46.101
anything-- since I'm up there now.

02:28:46.101 --> 02:28:47.464
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:28:47.464 --> 02:28:52.312
MARISHA: I signal to Deuce. I don't know what else
to call you.

02:28:52.312 --> 02:28:53.463
TALIESIN: Clay, if you have to.

02:28:53.463 --> 02:28:54.192
MARISHA: Clay.

02:28:54.192 --> 02:28:58.399
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay. 16.

02:28:58.399 --> 02:28:59.554
MATT: Okay.

02:28:59.554 --> 02:29:03.335
MARISHA: Hey, look at the windows, too.

02:29:03.335 --> 02:29:04.404
TALIESIN: They're nice.

02:29:04.404 --> 02:29:07.710
SAM: Oh no!

02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:09.225
TALIESIN: I'm looking in the windows.

02:29:09.225 --> 02:29:17.300
MATT: Okay, you see nobody else inside the
courtyard. You occasionally see the flickering

02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:21.993
movement. It looks like firelight is the source of
light that's coming through the two windows on the

02:29:21.993 --> 02:29:27.984
two sides of the facility you can see. No movement
yet.

02:29:27.984 --> 02:29:35.405
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to slowly start pacing
around towards the front. I'm also going to look

02:29:35.405 --> 02:29:37.924
into the windows. Do I see anything from my
vantage point?

02:29:37.924 --> 02:29:39.666
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:29:39.666 --> 02:29:45.137
MARISHA: Natural 20! Thanks, Gil!

02:29:45.137 --> 02:29:51.572
MATT: Okay, you feel like you have a pretty good
eye on those two sides of the interior windows.

02:29:51.572 --> 02:29:56.243
You do not see any movement yet, but you're pretty
locked on. What are the four of you guys doing now

02:29:56.243 --> 02:29:57.565
that you've met at the front gate?

02:29:57.565 --> 02:29:58.713
LIAM: We're at the front gate?

02:29:58.713 --> 02:29:59.212
MATT: Yes.

02:29:59.212 --> 02:30:04.506
LIAM: Okay, I can get this open, but I would
prefer to preserve my reserves, so can you get

02:30:04.506 --> 02:30:05.293
this door open?

02:30:05.293 --> 02:30:13.056
SAM: Sure, I'll pick the lock. 16 plus stuff. It's
plus four plus three or something like that? Is

02:30:13.056 --> 02:30:13.673
that right?

02:30:13.673 --> 02:30:15.621
MATT: That's your dexterity modifier plus your
proficiency modifier.

02:30:15.621 --> 02:30:17.995
SAM: Yeah, plus seven.

02:30:17.995 --> 02:30:19.231
MATT: All right; yeah.

02:30:19.231 --> 02:30:20.065
SAM: So 23.

02:30:20.065 --> 02:30:27.982
MATT: 23, okay. You take a moment and there are
two specific locks that are chained; one on each

02:30:27.982 --> 02:30:33.271
side that are closed. The one that's nearest to
you, easy enough. The one on the opposite side,

02:30:33.271 --> 02:30:39.725
you have to pull out one of your metallic hooks
that slips through a space in the wood and manage

02:30:39.725 --> 02:30:44.735
to pull it up on the side a little bit. You're
essentially reverse-picking it with two hooked

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:51.184
picks from the opposite side. It takes you a
little longer, until eventually it hangs.

02:30:51.184 --> 02:30:53.081
LIAM: I miss being a rogue every day.

02:30:53.081 --> 02:30:57.434
SAM: So far, everything's going great--

02:30:57.434 --> 02:30:58.860
ASHLY: Why did you say that?

02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:01.827
SAM: And we should assume that everything will
continue to go great.

02:31:01.827 --> 02:31:02.935
ASHLY: Oh god, okay.

02:31:02.935 --> 02:31:06.669
LIAM: I pull out the wire and get it between my
hands and whisper up to Beauregard: Are we good?

02:31:06.669 --> 02:31:10.930
Is everything good up there from what you can see?
Are we good?

02:31:10.930 --> 02:31:14.578
MARISHA: Coast looks clear. I don't know why I did
this with my fingers.

02:31:14.578 --> 02:31:19.940
ASHLY: Okay, now we have a choice. We could just
try to go downstairs and get your friends.

02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:23.492
LIAM: There is another door over there. Let's get
to that door.

02:31:23.492 --> 02:31:24.647
ASHLY: The back door?

02:31:24.647 --> 02:31:26.237
LIAM: We're at the front gate.

02:31:26.237 --> 02:31:28.816
MATT: You guys are over there.

02:31:28.816 --> 02:31:30.664
ASHLY: Oh duh, okay. All right.

02:31:30.664 --> 02:31:32.177
MATT: You're making your way into the courtyard
now.

02:31:32.177 --> 02:31:33.664
LIAM: Yeah, so we have to get to that door.

02:31:33.664 --> 02:31:35.372
MATT: This door or this door. Your choice.

02:31:35.372 --> 02:31:36.710
ASHLY: That's the front?

02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:37.916
MATT: That's the front.

02:31:37.916 --> 02:31:45.874
TALIESIN: Or you could meet me at the corner,
since I'm walking around the-- Oh, I'm on the

02:31:45.874 --> 02:31:48.044
outer. I'm not in the center area yet?

02:31:48.044 --> 02:31:55.005
MATT: Technically, Beau, you guys are walking
perimeter on the outside wall. The rest of you

02:31:55.005 --> 02:32:06.020
cats are currently, essentially, over that way.
You guys have just passed through the gate on that

02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:09.189
side, where it's open and allowing you into the
courtyard.

02:32:09.189 --> 02:32:11.266
SAM: Caleb, I trust you. Where do we go, back--

02:32:11.681 --> 02:32:13.371
LIAM: There's no magic on the front door, right?

02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:15.135
MATT: You're still focusing as you come inside?

02:32:15.135 --> 02:32:17.699
LIAM: It's like ten minutes, so I've probably got
four or five minutes left.

02:32:17.699 --> 02:32:20.504
MATT: Yeah, no magic that you notice on the front
door of the fortress.

02:32:20.504 --> 02:32:27.105
LIAM: I think that we should cut around the side
and go to the back. They will probably be

02:32:27.105 --> 02:32:28.014
expecting that less.

02:32:28.014 --> 02:32:30.670
ASHLY: That leads into the kitchen, too. There
shouldn't be anyone in the kitchen.

02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:31.446
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

02:32:31.446 --> 02:32:37.265
SAM: Okay, but wait. Can we get Beau and Mr. Clay
down here as well to help?

02:32:37.265 --> 02:32:40.223
LIAM: I think we should leave them for the moment
to keep appearances up.

02:32:40.223 --> 02:32:43.984
SAM: Well then, in that case, can you carry Keg?

02:32:43.984 --> 02:32:46.312
ASHLY: Oh yeah, could you carry me?

02:32:46.312 --> 02:32:47.172
SUMALEE: I would love to.

02:32:47.172 --> 02:32:53.429
LIAM: Okay, but are you able to-- I don't
understand your people's ways, but are you able to

02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:57.410
help her the way you helped Beauregard earlier?

02:32:57.410 --> 02:32:59.866
SAM: Oh yes, you could use that spell that you
used earlier.

02:32:59.866 --> 02:33:02.174
LIAM: That ability you had to make Beauregard--

02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:07.681
MARISHA: It's within 30 feet of her, so yeah, I
think she should be good? But I think you have to

02:33:07.681 --> 02:33:12.542
cast it on the people within 30 feet of you.

02:33:12.542 --> 02:33:13.501
SAM: Recast!

02:33:13.501 --> 02:33:18.174
MATT: For the duration, each creature you choose
within 30 feet of you.

02:33:18.174 --> 02:33:19.961
LIAM: So you could drop it and do it again.

02:33:19.961 --> 02:33:21.226
SAM: Wait, for the duration--

02:33:21.226 --> 02:33:24.307
MARISHA: For the duration, each creature you
choose within 30 feet?

02:33:24.307 --> 02:33:25.871
LIAM: Who has it now?

02:33:25.871 --> 02:33:32.913
TALIESIN: I think it's as long as they're within
30 feet, it's like a field and you can say yea or

02:33:32.913 --> 02:33:34.282
nay. That's my view.

02:33:34.282 --> 02:33:38.052
MATT: It doesn't say at the moment of casting you
have to select; just that for the duration you

02:33:38.052 --> 02:33:43.720
choose. So, my interpretation, I would allow
someone to step into the radius, and you could

02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:44.484
then choose.

02:33:44.484 --> 02:33:47.337
SAM: Okay, so we know better. We know you don't
have to cast it.

02:33:47.337 --> 02:33:48.299
ASHLY: I'll snuggle up to Nila.

02:33:48.299 --> 02:33:49.967
SUMALEE: I choose Keg.

02:33:49.967 --> 02:33:53.806
LIAM: Let's tippy-toe around the back door.

02:33:53.806 --> 02:33:54.848
SAM: Okay, let's go!

02:33:54.848 --> 02:33:58.424
MATT: All right, everyone who's now making their
way around the back, make another stealth check.

02:33:58.424 --> 02:34:00.272
ASHLY: Am I at disadvantage now? Still?

02:34:00.272 --> 02:34:01.937
MATT: You're still at disadvantage, because you
still have your armor.

02:34:01.937 --> 02:34:08.168
ASHLY: So two plus ten plus five. 17.

02:34:08.168 --> 02:34:09.943
LIAM: I miss Vax so much.

02:34:09.964 --> 02:34:10.905
SAM: 23.

02:34:10.905 --> 02:34:11.914
LIAM: 14.

02:34:11.914 --> 02:34:14.149
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

02:34:14.149 --> 02:34:16.884
LIAM: Plus ten, whatever it is.

02:34:17.341 --> 02:34:17.909
SUMALEE: 12.

02:34:17.909 --> 02:34:23.301
MATT: Okay. You guys begin to head around this
direction?

02:34:23.301 --> 02:34:23.982
LIAM: Yeah.

02:34:23.982 --> 02:34:30.477
MATT: All right. Going past the barrel pile where
you had previously made your way in and out via

02:34:30.477 --> 02:34:43.609
owl the previous day. As you guys scoot past, you
hear the front door of the facility (thudding)

02:34:43.609 --> 02:34:53.880
(creaking). It opens ever so faintly to the
inside, and a figure peers out, having apparently

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:54.613
heard something.

02:34:54.613 --> 02:34:55.900
MARISHA: We don't see that?

02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:56.900
SAM: No, we already went--

02:34:56.900 --> 02:35:00.862
LIAM: No, these two. We asked them if they saw
anything right before we went.

02:35:00.862 --> 02:35:02.377
MARISHA: I didn't see that.

02:35:02.377 --> 02:35:05.505
MATT: You see a figure poke the head out and look
curiously.

02:35:05.505 --> 02:35:06.813
TALIESIN: Sorry!

02:35:06.813 --> 02:35:14.633
MATT: "What?" Make a deception check, with
advantage given that fact that it's in the

02:35:14.633 --> 02:35:17.592
darkness and not an unexpected scenario.

02:35:17.592 --> 02:35:20.149
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

02:35:20.149 --> 02:35:21.813
ASHLY: Hell yes!

02:35:21.813 --> 02:35:26.592
MATT: Guard looks past and closes the door.

02:35:26.592 --> 02:35:33.544
ASHLY: Oh my god. I'm going to have an ulcer after
this game!

02:35:33.544 --> 02:35:34.542
TALIESIN: Nah.

02:35:34.542 --> 02:35:39.055
MATT: You guys all continue to the back of the
facility.

02:35:39.055 --> 02:35:40.291
ASHLY: Except Keg.

02:35:40.291 --> 02:35:42.629
SUMALEE: No, you are with me. We're together.

02:35:42.629 --> 02:35:44.175
MATT: You guys are at the back door.

02:35:44.175 --> 02:35:48.053
LIAM: I'm going to guess that I have two or three
minutes left on Detect Magic, so does the door

02:35:48.053 --> 02:35:49.132
seem clear of that?

02:35:49.132 --> 02:35:50.656
MATT: The door seems to be clear of magic.

02:35:50.656 --> 02:35:53.415
TALIESIN: Who do I see on the front door, by the
way, really? What did he look like? I don't know

02:35:53.415 --> 02:35:54.632
who he was, but--

02:35:54.632 --> 02:36:00.382
MATT: From what you can look at, it looked to be
humanoid, it was hard to tell at this distance

02:36:00.382 --> 02:36:07.195
with the little bit of firelight you saw. Hood was
down. Short, black hair, looked a bit sallow.

02:36:07.195 --> 02:36:10.090
Young, but probably looked older than they were--

02:36:10.090 --> 02:36:11.794
MARISHA: Kill it! Kill it!

02:36:11.794 --> 02:36:12.980
ASHLY: Aww, damn.

02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:14.652
MATT: Nah, that would have been cool.

02:36:14.652 --> 02:36:15.792
LIAM: It was on my iPad!

02:36:15.792 --> 02:36:23.895
MATT: I should have run with it. You're at the
back door.

02:36:23.895 --> 02:36:32.572
LIAM: Luck, luck, luck. Is there any gap between
the bottom of the door and the floor that Frumpkin

02:36:32.572 --> 02:36:34.134
could fit through right now?

02:36:34.134 --> 02:36:37.454
MATT: There is a very faint bit that a spider
could fit though, yes.

02:36:37.454 --> 02:36:42.906
LIAM: In you go, buddy. Hold on to my hand,
please.

02:36:46.826 --> 02:36:49.467
ASHLY: We could do a hand chain.

02:36:50.106 --> 02:36:51.862
SAM: You're not with us.

02:36:51.862 --> 02:36:53.087
TALIESIN: Aww, damn it.

02:36:53.087 --> 02:37:00.290
LIAM: Telepathically, I tell Frumpkin to crawl up
the other side of the door and go onto the ceiling.

02:37:00.866 --> 02:37:03.980
MATT: All right. Frumpkin is now up, and there is
a kitchen.

02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:05.902
TALIESIN: Sandwiches!

02:37:05.902 --> 02:37:06.811
SAM: What?

02:37:06.811 --> 02:37:13.858
MATT: There is a kitchen, you can see there is an
oven. There looks to be a bunch of dirty dishes

02:37:13.858 --> 02:37:21.317
that have just piled up and haven't been washed in
a while. There is a path that goes to the right

02:37:21.317 --> 02:37:25.398
and further down this hallway, and there is a door
that leads further in.

02:37:25.398 --> 02:37:28.500
LIAM: Nila didn't tell us anything about a kitchen
from her--

02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:29.520
MARISHA: Yeah, she did.

02:37:30.646 --> 02:37:33.577
MARISHA: The hallway down the right is the one we
want to go to, if I remember correctly.

02:37:34.015 --> 02:37:34.902
SUMALEE: With the trapdoor.

02:37:34.902 --> 02:37:36.275
MARISHA: With the trapdoor, yep.

02:37:36.275 --> 02:37:40.689
LIAM: Well, that's where I will send Frumpkin
along the ceiling. Then when he gets to a door, he

02:37:40.689 --> 02:37:44.189
can go down the door and under, if there is a gap,
and then up the door.

02:37:44.189 --> 02:37:57.760
MATT: Okay. That's through into this hallway,
which currently ends in two more doors. This way

02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:58.844
and that way.

02:37:58.844 --> 02:38:03.769
LIAM: Are all these doors so far the same? They
are loose?

02:38:03.769 --> 02:38:08.398
MATT: They are loose. I mean, as far as small
gaps in between, very, very tiny.

02:38:08.398 --> 02:38:10.133
LIAM: A half-inch for Frumpkin?

02:38:10.133 --> 02:38:10.802
MATT: Yep.

02:38:10.802 --> 02:38:12.517
ASHLY: Would I be able to tell him which way to
go?

02:38:12.517 --> 02:38:15.079
MATT: He wouldn't be able to hear you.

02:38:15.079 --> 02:38:19.651
LIAM: I don't hear shit right now. I will send
Frumpkin through the next gap.

02:38:19.651 --> 02:38:23.914
MATT: Which one? There's two different doors. This
way or this way.

02:38:24.514 --> 02:38:26.015
LIAM: No, you can't tell me anything.

02:38:26.015 --> 02:38:28.374
TALIESIN: Here, have a laser pointer.

02:38:28.374 --> 02:38:30.801
SAM: Here is a laser pointer, Liam O'Brien.

02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:36.364
LIAM: I will do this one here.

02:38:36.364 --> 02:38:49.749
MATT: All right. Frumpkin moves into this chamber,
which unveils this chamber. In this chamber, you

02:38:49.749 --> 02:38:59.763
see a dining area of some kind, and you see there
are two of the hired guards in the process of

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:01.545
finishing an evening drink.

02:39:01.545 --> 02:39:03.079
SAM: Was it Phil and the other guy?

02:39:03.079 --> 02:39:04.454
MARISHA: Is it Phil?

02:39:04.454 --> 02:39:10.908
MATT: One of them is Phil. One of them is the
other guy. Looks like they're having a nightcap.

02:39:10.908 --> 02:39:12.585
ASHLY: Are they drunk?

02:39:12.585 --> 02:39:17.993
MATT: They've been drinking. You have no idea if
they're drunk. Frumpkin sees the two of them

02:39:17.993 --> 02:39:22.623
hushedly chatting to one other and drinking from
tankards.

02:39:22.623 --> 02:39:26.333
LIAM: I will have Frumpkin back away, under the
crack.

02:39:26.333 --> 02:39:31.492
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check for Frumpkin
because now you are in eyesight of--

02:39:31.492 --> 02:39:33.544
LIAM: He is so little. He is so small.

02:39:33.544 --> 02:39:34.550
MATT: I know.

02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:44.885
LIAM: Just one roll? That's okay. Hold on,
everybody. 14. Wait, everything's crazy. I need a

02:39:44.885 --> 02:39:46.544
different browser window.

02:39:46.544 --> 02:39:47.596
MATT: What did you roll?

02:39:47.596 --> 02:39:50.113
LIAM: Well, I rolled a 14 but it's better than
that, it's 16.

02:39:50.113 --> 02:39:53.218
MATT: That's fine. They do not see Fumpkin. They
have had just enough to drink where they did not

02:39:53.218 --> 02:39:54.003
see Frumpkin.

02:39:54.003 --> 02:39:55.760
LIAM: (singing) The Itsy Bitsy Spider.

02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:58.089
MATT: Frumpkin is going where?

02:39:58.089 --> 02:40:04.550
LIAM: Back under that door, and he will peeky-poo
under the door he has not checked yet.

02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:14.440
MATT: Okay. That leads into another chamber, a
hallway, that continues down and then seems to

02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:16.266
open into another walkway.

02:40:16.266 --> 02:40:19.097
LIAM: Yeah, this door. This one here.

02:40:19.097 --> 02:40:29.575
MATT: Frumpkin goes and opens that one, which
leads into another hallway, a very small chamber,

02:40:29.575 --> 02:40:38.043
and there are a couple of odd pieces of dried
goods in the corners, and a wooden trapdoor.

02:40:38.043 --> 02:40:39.347
LIAM: To the bottom.

02:40:39.347 --> 02:40:41.728
SAM: Trapdoor to the bottom?

02:40:41.728 --> 02:40:43.667
MATT: Seems to be a trapdoor.

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:45.484
LIAM: Any cracks that are a half-inch wide, big
enough for a spider?

02:40:45.484 --> 02:40:46.409
MATT: No.

02:40:46.409 --> 02:40:51.412
LIAM: I remember this. Okay. That's a wall covered
by that paper there that you don't need to

02:40:51.412 --> 02:40:52.333
uncover, right?

02:40:52.333 --> 02:40:53.609
MATT: That is a wall, yes.

02:40:53.609 --> 02:41:00.557
LIAM: Back out of this, I know where I am. I will
go along the wall here. Frumpkin will crawl on the

02:41:00.812 --> 02:41:02.756
wall. Oh, you can't see where I'm pointing.

02:41:02.756 --> 02:41:04.798
MATT: On the wall over here?

02:41:04.798 --> 02:41:10.054
LIAM: Yeah, and crawl around the corner and peek
around the corner into that colored spot.

02:41:10.054 --> 02:41:18.375
MATT: Okay. Revealing that. It looks, and you can
see this has been storage. Because Frumpkin

02:41:18.375 --> 02:41:22.771
entered, this is all kitchen storage, and looking
down this hall--

02:41:22.771 --> 02:41:27.686
LIAM: This is too complicated for me to mutter, so
I'm not telling everybody this. This is too complicated.

02:41:28.198 --> 02:41:29.655
MATT: That is the gist of what you've seen.

02:41:29.655 --> 02:41:31.522
SAM: Wow, that's the whole layout, Frumpy.

02:41:31.522 --> 02:41:34.726
MATT: You don't know how much of this will stay.

02:41:34.726 --> 02:41:36.410
SAM: Sure glad we chose a spider!

02:41:36.410 --> 02:41:38.272
MARISHA: I take back mocking you for your choice.

02:41:38.272 --> 02:41:45.777
LIAM: I don't hear anything, and you're nowhere
near me. What I will do is send Frumpkin down this

02:41:45.777 --> 02:41:47.957
hallway, because I did not go this way yet.

02:41:47.957 --> 02:41:54.877
MATT: Turning around this way, you can see the
spiral staircase, the very same where you had

02:41:54.877 --> 02:42:00.231
briefly managed to dodge Lorenzo earlier in the
day, heading up to the second floor.

02:42:00.231 --> 02:42:06.086
LIAM: I remember this from her stories, so I will
continue Frumpkin up the stairs.

02:42:06.086 --> 02:42:09.513
SAM: Up the stairs? Oh god, why? Why would you do
that?

02:42:09.513 --> 02:42:12.905
LIAM: Time is passing, because he's not that
quick.

02:42:12.905 --> 02:42:23.709
MATT: Right as Frumpkin passes that way, this door
opens up, and one of the two guards heads this

02:42:23.709 --> 02:42:28.377
way. A little sloppy, but turns and--

02:42:28.377 --> 02:42:30.911
LIAM: We'll make for the wall at that point.

02:42:30.911 --> 02:42:42.800
MATT: "Ew." He starts walking up, and goes in to
try and step on Frumpkin.

02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:44.571
LIAM: What does Frumpkin need to do, armor class,
right?

02:42:44.571 --> 02:42:45.853
MATT: Yeah, what's Frumpkin's armor class?

02:42:45.853 --> 02:42:47.730
LIAM: <i>Zwölf</i>.

02:42:47.730 --> 02:42:57.948
MATT: With disadvantage. That's 12. It goes ahead
and stomps down. That's a hit point.

02:42:57.948 --> 02:43:03.562
LIAM: He scurries away-- No, he scurries up onto
the wall, up onto the ceiling.

02:43:04.232 --> 02:43:07.516
MATT: What's the speed for Frumpkin?

02:43:07.516 --> 02:43:09.246
LIAM: 20 feet.

02:43:09.246 --> 02:43:14.287
MATT: Okay. The guard is like, "Ugh. Hey, Phil?"

02:43:14.287 --> 02:43:19.255
(laughter)

02:43:19.255 --> 02:43:22.941
MATT: "What? What's the problem?" "There's a
fucking spider in here."

02:43:22.941 --> 02:43:26.535
LIAM: There's a bug in this world, and I won't
rest until he's dead.

02:43:26.535 --> 02:43:29.438
TALIESIN: The most realistic thing I've ever--

02:43:29.438 --> 02:43:34.850
MATT: Heads back into the room and comes back with
these two metal tankards that are dinged up, and

02:43:34.850 --> 02:43:43.371
they both start throwing them up to try and smash
the spider. With that, the first one misses and

02:43:43.371 --> 02:43:46.440
(clatters) down the stairs.

02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:51.228
LIAM: Matt, I don't know if this will happen in
time, but what I tell him to do telepathically,

02:43:51.228 --> 02:43:57.783
because I should be close enough, 100 feet, is to
go in here, through this door that's open, and

02:43:57.783 --> 02:44:03.317
over the door and down the back, and once he's out
of sight, I will poof him out, if that works. They

02:44:03.317 --> 02:44:04.764
might hit him before it happens.

02:44:04.764 --> 02:44:10.025
MATT: Well, the first two slams, or tossing of
tankards, clanging loudly, do not hit.

02:44:10.025 --> 02:44:11.489
MARISHA: I thought it was going to blow our
cover.

02:44:11.489 --> 02:44:12.786
LIAM: It's a spider!

02:44:12.786 --> 02:44:18.591
MATT: They both turn around and follow like,
"Where did it go?", "It's this way!" and they both

02:44:18.591 --> 02:44:23.403
come back inside the room, trying to follow where
Frumpkin went.

02:44:23.403 --> 02:44:25.269
LIAM: But he disappears in the back of the door.

02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:31.123
MATT: They both look around like, "Shit. Ugh. I
can't sleep now with that thing around here. Keep

02:44:31.123 --> 02:44:36.738
"looking." That's the last thing that Frumpkin
hears before vanishing.

02:44:36.738 --> 02:44:37.685
SAM: Oh boy.

02:44:37.685 --> 02:44:50.156
LIAM: That was wild. Okay. Yes. Oh, hi. Again.
There's two of them. I pull a wire out and I aim

02:44:50.682 --> 02:44:56.678
towards my friends on the horses. There's two of
them. Six seconds go by. There's two of them on

02:44:56.678 --> 02:44:59.367
the first floor. What do we do?

02:44:59.367 --> 02:45:01.454
SAM: What do we do now? Should we go in?

02:45:01.454 --> 02:45:04.244
ASHLY: Do we have any sense if their clanging
disturbed anything?

02:45:04.244 --> 02:45:06.874
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:45:06.874 --> 02:45:10.293
SAM: Did you see a way to downstairs?

02:45:10.293 --> 02:45:10.776
ASHLY: 14.

02:45:10.776 --> 02:45:16.176
MATT: You're listening right now. You don't hear
anything, but you're also on the opposite side of

02:45:16.176 --> 02:45:19.097
where anybody else would be. So you have no idea.

02:45:19.097 --> 02:45:25.483
LIAM: I saw what the firbolg woman told us about.
There is a trapdoor not too far from us here.

02:45:25.483 --> 02:45:27.817
SAM: Why don't we go try to get down to it?

02:45:27.817 --> 02:45:31.695
LIAM: (whispers) <i>Ja</i>, okay, that's good. We have
to be very quiet.

02:45:31.695 --> 02:45:36.788
SUMALEE: There may be murderers inside the trap
door.

02:45:36.788 --> 02:45:48.362
LIAM: Here's what we do. Frumpkin, I take
Frumpkin. Oh, there's Frumpkin. I place Frumpkin

02:45:48.906 --> 02:45:49.762
on your shoulder.

02:45:49.762 --> 02:45:50.894
SAM: Yes?

02:45:50.894 --> 02:45:59.624
LIAM: You have to go in this door and I'm going to
talk into your ear. I'm going to hold Keg's

02:45:59.624 --> 02:46:04.968
shoulder and I am going to talk into your ear and
tell you which way to go to get you to the

02:46:04.968 --> 02:46:07.373
trapdoor. Okay, and you have to be very quiet.

02:46:07.373 --> 02:46:08.545
ASHLY: By yourself?

02:46:08.545 --> 02:46:19.119
LIAM: Yeah, and see if that trapdoor is open. If
it is, you will put my spider underneath and we

02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:20.870
will see what is going on.

02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:22.751
SAM: If the trapdoor is open?

02:46:22.751 --> 02:46:24.389
LIAM: If it's unlocked.

02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:26.388
SAM: Oh, if it's unlocked. Okay, got it.

02:46:26.388 --> 02:46:33.422
LIAM: Do not go in yourself right away, send in
Frumpkin to look. I will be watching the whole time.

02:46:33.896 --> 02:46:34.712
SAM: All right.

02:46:40.212 --> 02:46:42.668
MATT: Are you drinking to the point of
intoxication?

02:46:42.668 --> 02:46:44.201
SAM: No, just one big swig.

02:46:44.201 --> 02:46:45.227
MATT: All righty.

02:46:45.227 --> 02:46:46.875
SAM: Okay, let's go.

02:46:46.875 --> 02:46:48.012
MATT: All right.

02:46:48.012 --> 02:46:53.142
SAM: Got to pick a lock first, or check the door.

02:46:53.142 --> 02:46:55.804
MATT: Make an investigation check on the door.

02:46:55.804 --> 02:46:57.892
SAM: 24.

02:46:57.892 --> 02:46:59.727
MATT: 24. The door is indeed locked.

02:46:59.727 --> 02:47:01.451
SAM: I will try to pick it.

02:47:01.451 --> 02:47:03.378
MATT: Go ahead and roll for that. Plus six.

02:47:03.378 --> 02:47:04.509
SAM: It was 22.

02:47:04.509 --> 02:47:05.704
MATT: That's still enough, anyways.

02:47:05.704 --> 02:47:07.153
SAM: That does not work.

02:47:07.153 --> 02:47:09.199
MATT: What did you roll?

02:47:09.199 --> 02:47:11.645
SAM: It was a two plus whatever I said before,
seven.

02:47:11.645 --> 02:47:17.536
MATT: No. You fear breaking one of your lockpicks;
you remove it.

02:47:17.536 --> 02:47:18.854
SAM: I can't do it!

02:47:18.854 --> 02:47:19.479
LIAM: It's fine.

02:47:19.479 --> 02:47:23.426
SAM: Ooh! Push open the door with your massive
strength.

02:47:23.426 --> 02:47:25.238
ASHLY: The noise.

02:47:25.238 --> 02:47:29.465
LIAM: <i>Halt</i>, I cast--

02:47:29.465 --> 02:47:31.696
SAM: Can you get us in?

02:47:31.696 --> 02:47:33.583
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. I cast Knock on the door.

02:47:33.583 --> 02:47:34.553
SUMALEE: I was just looking!

02:47:34.553 --> 02:47:39.455
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you see Caleb flicker his hands through the air,

02:47:39.955 --> 02:47:44.766
his eyes focused in a distant stare for a moment.
You see this strange blue energy sparkle around

02:47:44.766 --> 02:47:47.456
the outside of the doorknob and the door opens.

02:47:47.456 --> 02:47:54.780
SAM: Wait, did you cast a spell? Oh, oh wow. Okay,
that was easy. All right, focus up.

02:47:54.780 --> 02:47:56.641
ASHLY: Nott, be careful.

02:47:56.641 --> 02:47:59.279
SAM: You care about me?

02:47:59.279 --> 02:48:01.694
ASHLY: Yeah.

02:48:01.694 --> 02:48:13.228
LIAM: At every turn-- Listen to me. At every turn,
when you can go left or right, if Frumpkin, who

02:48:13.579 --> 02:48:23.467
will be resting on your ear, tickles the inside of
the ear, it means go right. If nothing happens, go left.

02:48:23.467 --> 02:48:26.584
SAM: Inside-- tickle, right.

02:48:27.144 --> 02:48:28.513
LIAM: Tickle means right.

02:48:28.513 --> 02:48:31.935
SAM: Nothing, left. Liam eats farts. I'm ready.

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:33.954
LIAM: You've got it.

02:48:33.954 --> 02:48:34.936
SAM: Got it.

02:48:34.936 --> 02:48:37.289
LIAM and SAM: Tickle means right.

02:48:37.289 --> 02:48:39.840
MARISHA: I do another check to see if I see any
movement upstairs.

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:44.138
MATT: You're still keeping tabs on it. I'm not
going to have you roll just for consistently staring.

02:48:44.138 --> 02:48:45.313
MARISHA: I just want to make sure.

02:48:45.313 --> 02:48:51.376
MATT: Okay, you do see a shadow pass by the door--
by the window.

02:48:51.376 --> 02:48:53.155
MARISHA: By the window.

02:48:53.155 --> 02:48:56.173
SAM: I cast Mage Hand just in case.

02:48:56.173 --> 02:48:58.686
MATT: Okay. What do you do?

02:48:58.686 --> 02:49:02.007
SAM: I will go through and wait for a tickle.

02:49:02.007 --> 02:49:05.401
LIAM: My hand is on Keg's shoulder in case things
go to shit.

02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:11.014
MATT: To the right is a hallway, an open entrance
that goes into a pantry or storage room. To the

02:49:11.014 --> 02:49:13.167
left is a door that leads beyond the kitchen.

02:49:13.167 --> 02:49:15.919
LIAM: Tickle means right; left is nothing.

02:49:15.919 --> 02:49:17.721
SAM: Is there a tickle?

02:49:17.721 --> 02:49:18.414
LIAM: No.

02:49:18.414 --> 02:49:20.453
SAM: I will go straight.

02:49:23.883 --> 02:49:25.695
MATT: You're at a door.

02:49:25.695 --> 02:49:26.955
SAM: I will try the door.

02:49:26.955 --> 02:49:28.991
MATT: It opens, it's not locked.

02:49:28.991 --> 02:49:30.373
LIAM: Tickle, tickle.

02:49:30.373 --> 02:49:32.727
MATT: You feel a tickle.

02:49:32.727 --> 02:49:35.559
SAM: I turn right.

02:49:35.559 --> 02:49:38.689
MATT: Make a stealth check, please, because you're
now passing within ear shot of--

02:49:38.689 --> 02:49:39.871
SAM: That's a one!

02:49:39.871 --> 02:49:40.433
ASHLY: No!

02:49:40.433 --> 02:49:49.349
MATT: Okay. As you turn the corner, part of your
cloak seems to have caught the edge of one of the

02:49:49.644 --> 02:49:57.245
pots that was layered on the table right here. As
you pull through, pots start clattering. You guys

02:49:57.245 --> 02:50:04.650
watch as this whole stack of pots start pulling
off into the kitchen. The door here swings open

02:50:04.650 --> 02:50:12.846
and both of these figures come rushing in. "Hey,
what the hell!" They both pull out blades.

02:50:12.846 --> 02:50:15.544
LIAM: I drop it. We're in, go! I walk into the
building.

02:50:15.544 --> 02:50:17.410
MATT: All right, roll initiative, you guys.

02:50:17.410 --> 02:50:18.059
MARISHA: All right.

02:50:18.059 --> 02:50:19.283
ASHLY: Oh fuck.

02:50:19.283 --> 02:50:20.609
SAM: The rogue blew it.

02:50:20.609 --> 02:50:24.626
MARISHA: The rogue did blow it!

02:50:24.626 --> 02:50:26.338
LIAM: That's not what I expected.

02:50:26.338 --> 02:50:29.376
MARISHA: Don't die!

02:50:29.376 --> 02:50:30.989
ASHLY: Ten?

02:50:30.989 --> 02:50:35.384
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20?

02:50:35.384 --> 02:50:36.357
LIAM: 21.

02:50:36.357 --> 02:50:45.780
MARISHA: Also 21. I'm actually going ahead and
roll my d8 with this as well. Plus seven, 29.

02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:47.287
Sorry, 28.

02:50:47.287 --> 02:50:52.666
LIAM: Did the sound of clattering pans clatter
outside?

02:50:52.666 --> 02:50:55.583
MATT: What do you mean?

02:50:55.583 --> 02:50:57.544
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Did we hear it?

02:50:57.544 --> 02:50:58.986
LIAM: Did the people outside hear it?

02:50:58.986 --> 02:51:02.605
MATT: You guys would have heard it very faintly.
Because the door was open, and it did fill what

02:51:02.605 --> 02:51:14.694
was normally a pretty still evening. That brings
us to them. All right. That brings us to 20 to 15.

02:51:14.694 --> 02:51:15.495
SAM: 15.

02:51:15.495 --> 02:51:16.585
SUMALEE: 18.

02:51:16.585 --> 02:51:24.736
MATT: 18, all right. Nott... all right. 15 to ten?

02:51:24.736 --> 02:51:25.563
ASHLY: Ten.

02:51:25.563 --> 02:51:26.195
TALIESIN: 12.

02:51:26.195 --> 02:51:30.389
MARISHA: Wait, who was a 12? You?

02:51:30.389 --> 02:51:38.371
MATT: All right, I think that's everyone. Top of
the combat round at this moment. Beau, you're up first.

02:51:38.843 --> 02:51:39.362
MARISHA: Okay.

02:51:39.362 --> 02:51:46.731
MATT: Hearing this noise, you are on the wall at
this point keeping an eye. You guys would probably

02:51:46.731 --> 02:51:51.203
be at angles here if you maintained patrol and
tried to case both sides.

02:51:51.203 --> 02:51:58.127
MARISHA: I want to look at the window. Do I see
that figure I just saw? Does it seem like the pots

02:51:58.127 --> 02:52:02.528
and pans got that figure's attention and they're
hastily moving?

02:52:02.528 --> 02:52:07.301
MATT: You saw them move casually past one window
and then move quicker past the other.

02:52:07.301 --> 02:52:09.224
MARISHA: Okay, where am I?

02:52:09.224 --> 02:52:11.083
MATT: You're over here, on the wall.

02:52:11.083 --> 02:52:13.565
MARISHA: I'm over there.

02:52:13.565 --> 02:52:19.938
MATT: You guys have been on the wall this whole
time, so you're right over here. Essentially about

02:52:19.938 --> 02:52:20.557
that high.

02:52:20.557 --> 02:52:29.355
MARISHA: Okay, I am going to-- do I try and make a
distraction or run?

02:52:29.355 --> 02:52:33.282
SUMALEE: Good question.

02:52:33.282 --> 02:52:39.509
MARISHA: I'm going to light one of those
firecrackers again, and I'm going to toss it this

02:52:39.509 --> 02:52:41.117
direction towards the front of the door.

02:52:41.117 --> 02:52:41.790
SUMALEE: Yes.

02:52:41.790 --> 02:52:43.145
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a dexterity check.

02:52:46.365 --> 02:52:47.565
MARISHA: Natural 20!

02:52:47.565 --> 02:52:50.324
MATT: Where directly do you want to aim it?

02:52:50.324 --> 02:52:53.990
MARISHA: I want to try and aim it to where it
sounds like there's a commotion happening at this

02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:58.436
front door to draw people this way and not at the
back.

02:52:58.436 --> 02:53:03.991
MATT: You go ahead and you throw it. It lands.
It's going to take a second for it to go off, but

02:53:03.991 --> 02:53:08.812
it definitely seems to have rolled passed and over
in the vicinity just past that corner.

02:53:08.812 --> 02:53:11.032
MARISHA: I'm assuming that was my action?

02:53:11.032 --> 02:53:14.823
MATT: That was your action, and I'll say bonus
action to pull it out, light it and throw.

02:53:14.823 --> 02:53:18.728
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my movement to
just haul ass towards these guys.

02:53:18.728 --> 02:53:20.041
MATT: Along the wall?

02:53:20.041 --> 02:53:21.012
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:53:21.012 --> 02:53:26.473
MATT: All right. (counting) That's about as far as
you can get right there.

02:53:26.473 --> 02:53:26.971
MARISHA: Okay.

02:53:26.971 --> 02:53:28.942
MATT: Ending your turn. Caleb you're up.

02:53:28.942 --> 02:53:41.534
LIAM: I slap my hand down on Keg's shoulder and I,
with a free hand, stick licorice root into my

02:53:41.931 --> 02:53:48.778
mouth and start chewing and squeeze her shoulder
and you are Hasted. And I will-- a couple of

02:53:48.778 --> 02:53:53.358
things, and I can't find my card right now, but
you have a plus two to your AC, you have advantage

02:53:53.358 --> 02:53:57.956
on dexterity saving throws, and an additional
action on each of your turns.

02:53:57.956 --> 02:53:59.926
MATT: So you can have four attacks in a single
round.

02:53:59.926 --> 02:54:01.162
LIAM: You are very fast right now.

02:54:01.162 --> 02:54:04.385
MATT: And your movement is twice as much. So you
have 50 feet a turn.

02:54:04.385 --> 02:54:10.582
LIAM: I start moving into the building, as far as
I can, actually. Behind Nott.

02:54:10.582 --> 02:54:16.909
MATT: I'll put this on Keg as a reminder. So you
move in (counting) right there?

02:54:16.909 --> 02:54:18.046
LIAM: By the doorway? Yeah, that's good.

02:54:18.046 --> 02:54:20.537
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

02:54:20.537 --> 02:54:23.335
LIAM: Pressing into the wall there, so that people
can get by me.

02:54:23.335 --> 02:54:32.789
MATT: All right. One of them shouts, "We got
company!" over his shoulder, behind.

02:54:32.789 --> 02:54:34.029
LIAM: Oh, that's terrible.

02:54:34.029 --> 02:54:40.353
MATT: A natural 19 on the dice. Going to move in
here, this one is going to move in as well. They

02:54:40.707 --> 02:54:48.116
are probably going to move right there. They're
both going to make attacks on Nott.

02:54:48.116 --> 02:54:48.702
SAM: Sure.

02:54:48.702 --> 02:54:53.964
MATT: The first one is going to be a 13 to hit.

02:54:53.964 --> 02:54:54.892
SAM: Miss!

02:54:54.892 --> 02:54:59.458
MATT: You duck out of the way. You see the short
sword they pull spark across the stone, carving

02:54:59.458 --> 02:55:04.922
down the side. No impact. The other one uses that
moment to try and swing at you. That's equally

02:55:04.922 --> 02:55:10.683
terrible! That's far worse, actually. That's a
six.

02:55:10.683 --> 02:55:11.763
SAM: Miss.

02:55:11.763 --> 02:55:16.466
MATT: Both of them (whooshing), no effect, but
they're both shouting back over their shoulders

02:55:16.466 --> 02:55:23.894
like, "Intruder! Company!" That finishes their go.
Nila, you're up first.

02:55:23.894 --> 02:55:32.927
SUMALEE: Should I put my spirit totem now to give
us extra strength?

02:55:32.927 --> 02:55:34.749
LIAM: That's up to you.

02:55:34.749 --> 02:55:45.237
SUMALEE: It will only get within 30 feet around,
so Beau would not be covered.

02:55:45.237 --> 02:55:48.304
MARISHA: I'm coming into you, though. I'm coming
into you guys.

02:55:48.304 --> 02:55:59.559
SUMALEE: So when she moves into that-- Nila wants
to go inside.

02:55:59.559 --> 02:56:04.079
MATT: You move inside. (counting)

02:56:04.079 --> 02:56:06.191
SUMALEE: As close as I can get toward the trapdoor.

02:56:06.191 --> 02:56:10.985
MATT: 25, 30. You can get right into that doorway
right there.

02:56:11.491 --> 02:56:13.522
SUMALEE: Then can I take my shillelagh?

02:56:13.522 --> 02:56:18.307
MATT: Unfortunately, you cannot get close enough
to hit them physically. You're too far away from

02:56:18.307 --> 02:56:19.436
the combat.

02:56:19.436 --> 02:56:24.154
SUMALEE: Wait. Within ten feet of one of them?

02:56:24.154 --> 02:56:24.914
MATT: Yes.

02:56:24.914 --> 02:56:26.649
SUMALEE: Poison Spray.

02:56:26.649 --> 02:56:37.230
MATT: All right, Poison Spray. Yeah, that one
creatures does, has a ten feet range. Okay. It

02:56:37.230 --> 02:56:42.615
makes a constitution saving throw. That is a
failure with a natural five, so roll damage on

02:56:42.615 --> 02:56:51.402
that. It is a 2d12, right? Plus 1d12. Does this
damage increase as you level up?

02:56:51.402 --> 02:56:53.326
SUMALEE: I think so. I wasn't sure.

02:56:53.326 --> 02:56:56.123
MATT: A lot of cantrips do. Yes, it does, so roll
2d12.

02:56:56.123 --> 02:57:02.890
SUMALEE: One. 11.

02:57:02.890 --> 02:57:06.517
MATT: 12 points of poison damage to the one on the
left there. All of a sudden, as Nila rounds the

02:57:06.517 --> 02:57:16.945
corner, extending your hand, this sudden plume of
dark purplish-black gas emanates around their

02:57:16.945 --> 02:57:23.393
face. They begin coughing horribly as it stings
the inside of their lungs and throat. That

02:57:23.393 --> 02:57:26.088
finishes your turn? That brings us to Nott.

02:57:26.088 --> 02:57:44.858
SAM: Oh Jesus. I will bonus action disengage, and
run through the door that the spider told me to go through.

02:57:44.858 --> 02:57:45.836
MATT: Which one?

02:57:45.836 --> 02:57:46.743
SAM: The closed one.

02:57:46.743 --> 02:57:53.204
MATT: All right, you go to that door. It's
locked.

02:57:53.204 --> 02:57:55.478
SAM: Locked? Great, I'll go through the other
door.

02:57:55.478 --> 02:58:00.415
MATT: You can use your action to try and fast pick
it, if you like. It's up to you. Because you can

02:58:00.415 --> 02:58:02.147
do that as a rogue.

02:58:02.147 --> 02:58:03.768
SAM: Sure, I'll do that. I'll fast pick.

02:58:03.768 --> 02:58:04.726
MATT: Go for it.

02:58:04.726 --> 02:58:06.658
SAM: Pick fast. 12.

02:58:06.658 --> 02:58:11.727
MATT: 12? It holds tight.

02:58:11.727 --> 02:58:15.037
SAM: Sure. I have any more movement?

02:58:15.037 --> 02:58:19.665
MATT: You have currently 20 feet.

02:58:19.665 --> 02:58:26.224
SAM: I will run into the next room, as far as I
can get.

02:58:26.224 --> 02:58:32.606
MATT: (counting) That puts you right there. That
ends your go. It is now Clay's turn.

02:58:32.606 --> 02:58:37.674
SAM: Wait, did she give me any bonuses? No, right?
Did you do your order of the totem thing?

02:58:37.674 --> 02:58:38.993
MATT: No, she did not do her totem.

02:58:38.993 --> 02:58:46.644
TALIESIN: Ah man. I guess I'm going to take 60
feet of running to find out what that commotion is

02:58:46.644 --> 02:58:48.326
on the other--

02:58:51.886 --> 02:58:53.407
MATT: You're about there.

02:58:53.407 --> 02:59:03.065
TALIESIN: Actually, would I have gone for the
front door or-- No, I would have gone for the

02:59:03.065 --> 02:59:05.836
back. That's what I got.

02:59:05.836 --> 02:59:08.084
MATT: Ending your go; Keg, you're up.

02:59:08.084 --> 02:59:12.044
ASHLY: Because I'm hasted, can I get right in
front of Nila?

02:59:12.742 --> 02:59:18.948
MATT: (counting) Yeah, easily. Whoa, you dart
past. Nila's standing there--

02:59:18.948 --> 02:59:20.549
LIAM: She's got another ten feet.

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:24.217
MATT: Yes, she does. Nila's standing there,
finishes the Poison Spray, suddenly there's this

02:59:24.217 --> 02:59:32.158
blur of speed, plate, and hair as Keg rushes by
Nila's side, actually causing the edge of her

02:59:32.158 --> 02:59:37.891
clothing to ripple up and back down into place.
They're both there, right in your face, and they

02:59:37.891 --> 02:59:42.037
watch as you emerge. They don't even have time to
process what you are. You're just a shape and

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:44.802
anger, and they're like, "Whoa!" What do you want
to do?

02:59:44.802 --> 02:59:48.225
ASHLY: I'm going to smack the poisoned one with my
battleaxe.

02:59:48.225 --> 02:59:50.073
MATT: All right, go for it. First attack.

02:59:50.073 --> 02:59:51.609
ASHLY: 17 to hit.

02:59:51.609 --> 02:59:52.795
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

02:59:52.795 --> 02:59:58.019
ASHLY: Okay, and then 1d8 plus four. That's
eight.

02:59:58.019 --> 03:00:05.027
MATT: Eight points of damage. (smack) He looks
hurt, like between the poison gas and that he's

03:00:05.027 --> 03:00:09.299
hurt. He's not down yet, but he's looking rough.

03:00:09.299 --> 03:00:13.248
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to smack him again, this
time with the warhammer, why not, just for fun.

03:00:13.248 --> 03:00:17.066
That will be 15 plus seven. I can't do math.

03:00:17.066 --> 03:00:20.207
MATT: 15 plus seven? Yeah, 25, that hits. Roll
damage.

03:00:20.207 --> 03:00:22.521
ASHLY: Then that is 11.

03:00:22.521 --> 03:00:29.185
MATT: 11. With that, he's (smack), "What the--?!"
Second hit and he goes down like a sack of potatoes.

03:00:29.185 --> 03:00:31.313
(cheering)

03:00:31.313 --> 03:00:35.758
MATT: He is on the ground, not moving. His friend
just sees it, goes, "What?!"

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:41.822
ASHLY: Then I have another action. I'm going to
smack him, the friend that's still there. 11?

03:00:41.822 --> 03:00:46.051
MATT: 11. This time, seeing this go down, he
dodges out of the way and your weapon scrapes

03:00:46.051 --> 03:00:50.234
across the outside of the door frame, actually
cutting a bit into it. You have to pull it out.

03:00:50.234 --> 03:00:54.089
Still have your bonus action if you wanted to do a
fourth attack.

03:00:54.089 --> 03:00:59.456
ASHLY: I do want to do a fourth attack. I'm going
to try again. 12.

03:00:59.456 --> 03:01:03.806
MATT: 12. Unfortunately, he just manages to duck
twice. The second time actually gleans off the

03:01:03.806 --> 03:01:06.040
shoulder, but the armor's too thick. No impact.

03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:08.055
ASHLY: Should I do action surge?

03:01:11.005 --> 03:01:12.133
SAM: Yeah!

03:01:12.133 --> 03:01:13.119
LIAM: No! Tell her nothing!

03:01:13.119 --> 03:01:14.894
MATT: What do you want to do?

03:01:14.894 --> 03:01:22.439
ASHLY: I'm going to use action surge, I guess. No,
I'm not. I have a little bit more movement, right?

03:01:22.814 --> 03:01:23.731
MATT: You have ten feet of movement, yes.

03:01:23.731 --> 03:01:24.817
ASHLY: Can I get between him and Nott?

03:01:24.817 --> 03:01:32.043
MATT: You can move (counting). You can't quite get
between the two of them, but you can be wedged

03:01:32.043 --> 03:01:35.769
into the doorway. If they try to move away from
you, you will get an attack of opportunity if you

03:01:35.769 --> 03:01:36.814
want to take one as a reaction.

03:01:36.814 --> 03:01:37.471
ASHLY: Okay.

03:01:37.471 --> 03:01:40.606
MATT: That ends your turn. Back at the top. Beau,
you're up.

03:01:40.606 --> 03:01:43.460
MARISHA: Okay. Have I heard my cherry bomb go
off?

03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:46.853
MATT: Not quite yet, because it's on an initiative
of 20.

03:01:46.853 --> 03:01:54.866
MARISHA: Oh, what? Amazing. Okay. I'm going to
move my full speed, my 40 feet. Does it get me in?

03:01:54.866 --> 03:01:57.653
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to leap off the
wall.

03:01:57.653 --> 03:02:02.056
MARISHA: 14.

03:02:02.056 --> 03:02:05.449
MATT: 14, that's enough. You get right to the
kitchen.

03:02:05.449 --> 03:02:07.582
MARISHA: Okay.

03:02:07.582 --> 03:02:09.610
MATT: You're just at the door. That's your full
movement.

03:02:09.610 --> 03:02:20.262
MARISHA: I'm going to use-- no. I'm going to use
my action to move again, to dash.

03:02:20.262 --> 03:02:21.028
MATT: Okay.

03:02:21.028 --> 03:02:23.828
MARISHA: Nope, I'm going to go that way.

03:02:23.828 --> 03:02:27.736
MATT: (counting)

03:02:28.170 --> 03:02:33.509
MARISHA: Okay. I don't want to peek around the
wall; I want to ninja dash around, and I want to

03:02:33.509 --> 03:02:38.578
get up against the wall, peek, and look for anyone
who might be coming around that hall.

03:02:38.578 --> 03:02:39.677
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

03:02:39.677 --> 03:02:45.844
MARISHA: As I ran by, I went: Psst! To Caleb, to
let him know that I was here and going that way.

03:02:45.844 --> 03:02:49.941
MATT: You glance over just to see this quick flash
of Beau disappearing down the hallway.

03:02:49.941 --> 03:02:50.513
LIAM: Blue fabric?

03:02:50.513 --> 03:02:53.010
MARISHA: I'm like: I'm going to watch this way.
Watch for me!

03:02:53.010 --> 03:02:53.805
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

03:02:53.805 --> 03:03:00.771
LIAM: Yeah, I should be able to see just over or
under Nila's legs or something, that one last asshole?

03:03:00.771 --> 03:03:03.308
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:03.308 --> 03:03:06.787
LIAM: I'm going to do a fastball special, a Fire
Bolt, at him.

03:03:06.787 --> 03:03:07.970
MATT: Roll an attack.

03:03:07.970 --> 03:03:09.523
SAM: Is this Phil, or is this his friend?

03:03:09.523 --> 03:03:11.856
ASHLY: Oh yeah, did we kill Phil?

03:03:11.856 --> 03:03:13.766
MATT: No, Phil's the one standing.

03:03:13.766 --> 03:03:14.959
ASHLY: (laughs) Sorry, Phil.

03:03:14.959 --> 03:03:17.590
SAM: Leave him alive! He must live!

03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:21.419
LIAM: I rolled a 15 to hit Phil.

03:03:21.419 --> 03:03:23.098
SAM: These guys are human?

03:03:23.098 --> 03:03:24.288
MATT: 15 to hit Phil, that hits.

03:03:24.288 --> 03:03:25.372
LIAM: Oh, <i>gut</i>!

03:03:25.372 --> 03:03:26.707
SAM: These guys are humans?

03:03:26.707 --> 03:03:33.493
MATT: One of them was human, one looked to be
half-elf. Phil is the half-elf. You see this

03:03:33.493 --> 03:03:34.952
younger looking guy--

03:03:34.952 --> 03:03:38.258
LIAM: (gasps) I rolled a ten. Out of ten.

03:03:38.258 --> 03:03:39.027
MATT: Ooh.

03:03:39.027 --> 03:03:39.621
ASHLY: Oh.

03:03:39.621 --> 03:03:40.967
LIAM: (whoosh)

03:03:40.967 --> 03:03:42.851
MATT: So ten, plus?

03:03:42.851 --> 03:03:44.313
LIAM: That's it, it's just a cantrip.

03:03:44.313 --> 03:03:47.307
MATT: Right, cantrip, at 5th-level, it does 2d10.

03:03:47.307 --> 03:03:48.542
LIAM: Does it? Okay.

03:03:48.542 --> 03:03:49.864
MATT: Yeah. Cantrips get better.

03:03:49.864 --> 03:03:50.544
LIAM: 13.

03:03:50.544 --> 03:03:56.789
MATT: Okay. 13 points of damage. You feel the
sudden burst of warm air up under your outfit for

03:03:56.789 --> 03:04:01.269
a moment, Nila, as this fire bolt goes firing
through from between your legs and explodes into

03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:05.958
the chest of the guard in front of you. (yells)
Backs up, and the flames lick up the front of his

03:04:05.958 --> 03:04:09.930
armor before he pats them out for a second. That
finish your turn, Caleb?

03:04:09.930 --> 03:04:13.928
LIAM: Part of me really likes the way fire feels.
That's it.

03:04:13.928 --> 03:04:15.563
MATT: Finishing Caleb's go.

03:04:15.563 --> 03:04:17.545
LIAM: Ah, no. I'm going to back up ten feet.

03:04:17.545 --> 03:04:24.353
MATT: He's right there. Knock the chair over as
you back up. At this point, you guys all hear,

03:04:24.353 --> 03:04:33.807
echoing off in the distance, (popping). Small
firecrackers are now exploding on the outside of

03:04:33.807 --> 03:04:36.370
the front fortress (popping).

03:04:36.370 --> 03:04:38.873
MARISHA: Let's hope this works the way I have in
my head.

03:04:38.873 --> 03:04:40.508
SUMALEE: Yes! Blow them up!

03:04:44.028 --> 03:04:51.111
MATT: Nott, as you were looking off, you see a
shape run past and start heading for the door. You see--

03:04:51.495 --> 03:04:54.513
SAM: Running past where? Oh, there.

03:04:54.513 --> 03:05:00.738
MATT: Past this way, you see a figure make their
way to the door, and put their back to it. They

03:05:00.738 --> 03:05:02.243
haven't noticed you yet.

03:05:02.243 --> 03:05:02.772
SAM: Okay.

03:05:02.772 --> 03:05:08.536
MATT: As they put their back to the door, focusing
on where the sound of those fireworks go off,

03:05:08.536 --> 03:05:12.575
looks back through the doorway, into the middle of
the mess hall, hears this commotion and looks

03:05:12.575 --> 03:05:13.301
right to you.

03:05:13.301 --> 03:05:14.970
SAM: Wait, sees me or doesn't see me?

03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:19.622
MATT: <i>Does</i> see you. Because you're not trying to
hide and it is a lit interior. This is Wohn. This

03:05:19.622 --> 03:05:26.704
is the female human barbarian that had rushed
Caleb before. Previously had a great maul.

03:05:26.704 --> 03:05:34.407
However, is instead wielding a very familiar
two-handed greatsword. Wide blade with runic hilt.

03:05:34.407 --> 03:05:37.253
The weapon that Yasha had on her--

03:05:37.253 --> 03:05:42.637
SAM: Oh, that's right, they had the weapons.
Shit.

03:05:42.637 --> 03:05:46.974
MATT: However, that's her turn. That brings us to
Nila. You're up.

03:05:46.974 --> 03:05:55.966
SUMALEE: Okay. I want to get to the trapdoor.

03:05:55.966 --> 03:05:57.787
LIAM: What do you do, mom?

03:05:57.787 --> 03:06:04.149
SUMALEE: Yes. I would like to move. Oh wait, he's
not dead yet.

03:06:04.603 --> 03:06:11.013
MATT: He is not. You can just barely see another
individual who appears to be joining the fray

03:06:11.013 --> 03:06:14.757
across the way. One of the slavers that is
responsible for taking your family.

03:06:14.757 --> 03:06:15.678
LIAM: Fucking slavers.

03:06:15.678 --> 03:06:20.633
SUMALEE: Okay. I'd like to move forward and finish
off Phil.

03:06:20.633 --> 03:06:21.914
MATT: Okay.

03:06:21.914 --> 03:06:23.420
SUMALEE: Sorry.

03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:27.339
MARISHA: Mother's vengeance. Fuck you, Phil!

03:06:27.339 --> 03:06:29.327
MATT: Are you going Poison Spray, or you going--

03:06:29.327 --> 03:06:31.062
SUMALEE: I'm going to use the shillelagh.

03:06:31.062 --> 03:06:32.746
MATT: Okay. You step in--

03:06:32.746 --> 03:06:36.856
MARISHA: (singing) I can feel it coming in the air
tonight.

03:06:36.856 --> 03:06:39.223
SAM: (synth drums)

03:06:39.223 --> 03:06:41.056
SUMALEE: This is for my son, Asar!

03:06:41.056 --> 03:06:46.398
MATT: Go for it. Swing for the attack. Actually,
you could, if you wanted to, I'll allow you to

03:06:46.398 --> 03:06:50.556
move in to flank with Keg. That'll give you
advantage on the attack roll.

03:06:50.556 --> 03:06:54.080
SUMALEE: Oh, thank you. 12 plus--

03:06:54.080 --> 03:06:55.559
ASHLY: You get to roll one more.

03:06:55.559 --> 03:06:57.607
MATT: Plus seven, so that would be 18. So roll one
more time.

03:06:57.607 --> 03:07:00.075
SUMALEE: 18, or... eh, 18.

03:07:00.075 --> 03:07:04.160
MATT: We'll take the 18. So that hits. Go ahead
and roll damage. That's a d8 plus four.

03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:08.143
SUMALEE: Six.

03:07:08.143 --> 03:07:14.063
MATT: All right. Ten points of damage. You rush in
(whack!), as you clock Phil on the side of his

03:07:14.063 --> 03:07:19.845
head, it slams him against the stone wall. He's
like, "Ugh!" His eyes rolling within his skull. He

03:07:19.845 --> 03:07:25.007
looks pretty heavily beaned. Still conscious, but
pretty badly beat up at this point. That finish

03:07:25.007 --> 03:07:25.687
your turn?

03:07:25.687 --> 03:07:33.323
SUMALEE: No. <i>Now</i> I would like to place my spirit
totem. I want to do it as close to the trapdoor

03:07:33.323 --> 03:07:39.402
as I can to hopefully protect as many people
inside.

03:07:39.402 --> 03:07:44.135
MATT: You have no visual, unfortunately, because
this door is still closed and locked. All you can

03:07:44.435 --> 03:07:49.556
see is what's in this room, this kitchen, and this
chamber here. You have no visual on the trapdoor.

03:07:49.556 --> 03:07:52.063
SUMALEE: But I know it's there. I know it's there
from when I--

03:07:52.063 --> 03:07:53.495
MATT: You know where it is, yes.

03:07:53.495 --> 03:08:03.359
SUMALEE: I feel like I-- Yes, I'm going to do it.

03:08:03.359 --> 03:08:04.547
LIAM: Redrum.

03:08:04.547 --> 03:08:05.549
SUMALEE: What?

03:08:05.549 --> 03:08:08.994
LIAM: Whatever you want, Sumalee!

03:08:08.994 --> 03:08:10.275
SUMALEE: I don't know!

03:08:10.275 --> 03:08:12.491
LIAM: I'm being a nerd. Have fun!

03:08:12.491 --> 03:08:23.331
SUMALEE: Yes, okay. I place my Bear Spirit Totem.

03:08:23.331 --> 03:08:26.228
MATT: Okay, so you're taking the totem.

03:08:26.228 --> 03:08:31.552
SUMALEE: This will protect anyone who comes within
30 feet of it.

03:08:31.552 --> 03:08:33.099
MATT: For the next minute, yes.

03:08:33.099 --> 03:08:40.909
SUMALEE: Oh gosh. All right. Okay, she grabs her
smell bag real quick. Hold on!

03:08:40.909 --> 03:08:43.285
MATT: Your choice.

03:08:43.285 --> 03:08:48.246
SUMALEE: I'm going to save it until next time.

03:08:48.246 --> 03:08:53.853
MATT: Okay. Since I actually skipped over Phil's
turn, Phil's going to, out of retribution for the

03:08:53.853 --> 03:08:59.629
attack, swing towards you, Nila, having had no
luck against you, and having not even wanting to

03:08:59.629 --> 03:09:04.075
touch this weird dwarven blur that's just
<i>destroyed</i> his friend. He's going to swing

03:09:04.075 --> 03:09:10.258
towards you with the blade. That's going to be a
14? What's your armor class?

03:09:10.258 --> 03:09:10.875
SUMALEE: 15.

03:09:10.875 --> 03:09:18.071
MATT: 15? Your shield deflects it off the side. No
impact. All right. Phil's accepting his fate.

03:09:18.071 --> 03:09:20.053
Nott, you're up.

03:09:20.053 --> 03:09:24.612
SAM: Oh boy. Me against a barbarian? Has she
turned to--

03:09:24.612 --> 03:09:26.244
ASHLY: Run for sure.

03:09:26.244 --> 03:09:27.864
SAM: To see me?

03:09:27.864 --> 03:09:29.475
LIAM: No. Stab and disengage.

03:09:29.475 --> 03:09:31.916
MATT: She has noticed you, yes.

03:09:31.916 --> 03:09:33.602
SAM: Okay.

03:09:33.602 --> 03:09:38.801
MATT: She used her turn to move and dash, so had
no action yet. But went up against the front door,

03:09:38.801 --> 03:09:42.862
hearing the sound from outside, and then turned
and just focused on you.

03:09:42.862 --> 03:09:47.354
SAM: Fuck. I will-- Keg is what?

03:09:47.354 --> 03:09:49.782
LIAM: Keg is right there to the bad guy. Am I
mistaken?

03:09:49.782 --> 03:09:52.143
SAM: Oh, fuck that guy.

03:09:52.143 --> 03:09:53.860
LIAM: But I mean, sneak attack damage--

03:09:53.860 --> 03:10:01.426
SAM: He's got like two hit points. Fuck that guy.
I'm going to try to disable the giant, larger

03:10:01.426 --> 03:10:08.767
threat than Phil, which probably won't work, but
it's worth a shot. I will point at the barbarian

03:10:08.767 --> 03:10:20.649
and say: Oi, I'm thinking of removing my spine
because it's only holding me back! I will cast

03:10:20.649 --> 03:10:23.588
Hideous Laughter on the giant thing.

03:10:23.588 --> 03:10:24.416
MATT: Okay.

03:10:24.416 --> 03:10:26.023
SAM: 14.

03:10:26.023 --> 03:10:31.056
MATT: 14 wisdom saving throw. That's a natural
six. Falls prone.

03:10:31.056 --> 03:10:31.766
SAM: Yes!

03:10:31.766 --> 03:10:33.030
ASHLY: She's prone!

03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:35.574
SAM: I took out the barbarian, guys.

03:10:35.574 --> 03:10:38.329
MARISHA: Well, she's prone.

03:10:38.329 --> 03:10:43.214
LIAM: I didn't even see the miniature beyond the
door. I didn't know she was there.

03:10:43.214 --> 03:10:50.517
MATT: She falls cackling to the ground. (laughter)
and is rolling on the ground, the blade falling

03:10:50.517 --> 03:10:53.958
out of her grip for the moment and then she
clutches it back to her, rolls with it.

03:10:53.958 --> 03:10:54.703
SAM: Oh, she has it?

03:10:54.703 --> 03:10:55.224
MATT: Yeah.

03:10:55.224 --> 03:10:56.512
LIAM: Tight tight tight.

03:10:56.512 --> 03:11:08.557
SAM: Cool cool cool. Tasha's: at the end of its
turn, it can make a wisdom saving throw. Hold on.

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:20.511
Okay. I'm going to get out of there, run past the
laughing thing.

03:11:20.511 --> 03:11:21.683
MATT: Okay.

03:11:21.683 --> 03:11:26.327
SAM: As fast as I can. Oh, not that way, the other
way.

03:11:26.327 --> 03:11:32.091
MATT: That's fine. (counting)

03:11:32.091 --> 03:11:41.138
SAM: Yeah. Do I try to get her weapon or do I keep
running? She's clutching it, still, you said?

03:11:41.138 --> 03:11:41.699
MATT: Yes.

03:11:41.699 --> 03:11:45.327
SAM: So it'd be like a strength check. I'm just
going to keep running. Another 30 feet.

03:11:45.327 --> 03:11:46.643
MATT: Which direction? Around here?

03:11:46.643 --> 03:11:50.458
SAM: Yeah. Well, because I'm still trying to get
where the spider told me to go.

03:11:50.458 --> 03:11:54.047
MATT: (counting) There you go.

03:11:54.047 --> 03:11:57.169
MARISHA: As Nott comes around the corner, I'm just
going to go: Hey! Psst!

03:11:57.169 --> 03:11:58.655
SAM: Huh? Ah!

03:11:58.655 --> 03:12:02.675
MARISHA: (shushing)

03:12:02.675 --> 03:12:05.593
MATT: That finishes Nott's go. Clay, you're up.

03:12:05.593 --> 03:12:08.157
TALIESIN: Another 60 feet.

03:12:08.157 --> 03:12:13.024
MATT: Are you jumping off the wall or going full
square on the outer wall?

03:12:13.024 --> 03:12:14.370
TALIESIN: I'll jump off the wall.

03:12:14.370 --> 03:12:16.232
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and land.

03:12:16.232 --> 03:12:19.811
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's 14.

03:12:19.811 --> 03:12:25.236
MATT: 14? Okay, you fall to one knee, but you get
up okay. You don't take any damage.

03:12:25.236 --> 03:12:26.532
LIAM: He's just that good.

03:12:26.532 --> 03:12:37.836
MATT: (counting) 30. You're just coming up on the
outside of the kitchen. The horse is just (snorting).

03:12:37.836 --> 03:12:39.004
TALIESIN: Hey, big guy.

03:12:39.004 --> 03:12:40.935
MARISHA: "Hey, big guy!"

03:12:45.255 --> 03:12:46.486
SAM: This guy!

03:12:46.486 --> 03:12:50.197
TALIESIN: How could you be angry at a horse, man?
It's not like this is an evil horse.

03:12:50.758 --> 03:12:54.192
LIAM: It's Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski.

03:12:54.192 --> 03:12:55.805
TALIESIN: It's not that far off.

03:12:55.805 --> 03:12:58.913
MATT: That finishes Clay's turn. Keg, you're up.

03:12:58.913 --> 03:13:00.186
ASHLY: I'm still Hasted, yes?

03:13:00.186 --> 03:13:00.758
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:00.758 --> 03:13:02.599
ASHLY: Okay, great. So I'm going to smack Phil.

03:13:03.261 --> 03:13:04.304
MATT: Go for it.

03:13:04.304 --> 03:13:05.635
ASHLY: That is 18.

03:13:05.635 --> 03:13:07.299
MATT: 18 definitely hits.

03:13:07.299 --> 03:13:10.020
ASHLY: And nine?

03:13:10.020 --> 03:13:12.024
MATT: Nine points of damage?

03:13:12.024 --> 03:13:17.245
ASHLY: Yeah.

03:13:17.245 --> 03:13:22.335
MATT: Phil is down. <i>Whack</i> up the side of the
head. Phil just crumples to the ground.

03:13:22.335 --> 03:13:24.451
ASHLY: Sorry, Phil! I'm going to run. Can I catch
up to Nott?

03:13:24.451 --> 03:13:26.418
LIAM and ASHLY: 50 feet of movement.

03:13:26.418 --> 03:13:27.740
ASHLY: 50 feet of movement.

03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:30.655
SAM: Did you see where I went?

03:13:30.655 --> 03:13:33.687
LIAM: Bing bang bong bing bong bing bong!

03:13:34.557 --> 03:13:36.110
MATT: (counting) You have ten more feet. You can't
quite get to Nott, but there's a laughing

03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:37.377
barbarian on the ground.

03:13:37.377 --> 03:13:38.639
ASHLY: I could dash, right?

03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:43.798
LIAM: She's on the ground, though, and she is out
of it so you could fucking Goodfellas the <i>shit</i>

03:13:43.798 --> 03:13:44.369
out of that woman.

03:13:44.369 --> 03:13:45.279
ASHLY: All right.

03:13:45.279 --> 03:13:46.010
MATT: Up to you.

03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:47.784
LIAM: Or whatever. Whatever you want.

03:13:48.307 --> 03:13:53.451
ASHLY: Okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Oh, I feel bad! I was
kind of friends with her back in the day. Okay,

03:13:53.451 --> 03:13:54.306
we'll do it.

03:13:54.306 --> 03:13:57.449
MATT: So the dwarf moves into there.

03:13:57.449 --> 03:14:08.000
ASHLY: I teabag her for roughly 15 minutes and
then I-- hastily. All right, here we go. Fuck.

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.421
SAM: I think you may get advantage because she's
prone.

03:14:12.421 --> 03:14:13.967
MATT: Yeah, it's advantage on the attack.

03:14:13.967 --> 03:14:16.384
ASHLY: Oh, okay, great. 11.

03:14:16.384 --> 03:14:18.268
MATT: 11? No.

03:14:18.268 --> 03:14:19.644
MARISHA: Is her AC down?

03:14:19.644 --> 03:14:27.187
MATT: Nope. The first attack, you go to swing and
she rolls over from the laughter and just hit the

03:14:27.187 --> 03:14:29.963
ground. The stone cracks from the impact.

03:14:29.963 --> 03:14:31.452
ASHLY: So I have two more actions.

03:14:31.452 --> 03:14:35.504
MATT: Yeah, because that was your second attack.
Then you have your extra attack, and then you have

03:14:35.504 --> 03:14:36.195
a bonus attack.

03:14:36.195 --> 03:14:37.056
SAM: Oh my god.

03:14:37.056 --> 03:14:38.107
ASHLY: I'm Hasted, right?

03:14:38.107 --> 03:14:40.553
MATT: That's how you have an additional attack. So
you have two more attacks.

03:14:40.553 --> 03:14:42.363
ASHLY: Try again. So 20?

03:14:42.796 --> 03:14:43.475
MATT: 20 definitely hits.

03:14:43.475 --> 03:14:44.622
SAM: Still advantage on the attack, right?

03:14:44.622 --> 03:14:45.517
MATT: Yep.

03:14:45.517 --> 03:14:46.902
TALIESIN: Roll again in case you crit.

03:14:46.902 --> 03:14:48.509
ASHLY: Okay, no, 20, and then--

03:14:48.509 --> 03:14:49.680
MATT: All right, roll damage on that.

03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:50.308
ASHLY: Ten.

03:14:50.308 --> 03:14:52.810
TALIESIN: Is it an auto--

03:14:52.810 --> 03:14:56.494
MATT: She makes a saving throw.

03:14:56.494 --> 03:14:58.261
TALIESIN: I mean is it advantage?

03:14:58.261 --> 03:15:00.114
LIAM: It is advantage, but it's not an auto crit.

03:15:00.114 --> 03:15:01.814
MATT: What is the DC? She rolled a 14.

03:15:01.814 --> 03:15:02.526
SAM: 14.

03:15:02.526 --> 03:15:04.777
MATT: Yeah, that spell has faded.

03:15:04.777 --> 03:15:07.898
SAM: Oh no. But you can still attack one more
time, right?

03:15:07.898 --> 03:15:09.972
MATT: She's still prone and you get another
attack, if you like.

03:15:10.664 --> 03:15:11.727
ASHLY: Okay.

03:15:11.727 --> 03:15:14.308
LIAM: Get that motherfucker. Get it get it, girl,
get it get it.

03:15:14.308 --> 03:15:16.743
ASHLY: I don't get advantage anymore, right?

03:15:16.743 --> 03:15:18.208
MATT: You still have advantage, she's still
prone.

03:15:18.208 --> 03:15:19.610
ASHLY: Oh, she's still prone, okay.

03:15:19.610 --> 03:15:20.670
SAM: Fuck you!

03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:22.595
ASHLY: 14?

03:15:22.595 --> 03:15:26.397
MARISHA: Barbarian, 14?

03:15:26.397 --> 03:15:29.491
MATT: 14 does not hit. It misses by one.

03:15:29.491 --> 03:15:32.015
SAM: Those dice are terrible!

03:15:32.015 --> 03:15:37.563
MATT: I'm sorry. However, you are just a
frightening display in front of her.

03:15:37.563 --> 03:15:38.995
ASHLY: Now I'm going to action surge.

03:15:38.995 --> 03:15:43.133
MARISHA: Ooh! Yaaas, girl, yaaas!

03:15:43.133 --> 03:15:46.918
ASHLY: Shit! All right, 17!

03:15:47.439 --> 03:15:48.477
MATT: That does hit.

03:15:48.477 --> 03:15:52.641
ASHLY: Oh my god, Jesus Christ almighty. 11
damage.

03:15:52.641 --> 03:15:55.692
MATT: 11 points of damage, all right. You have one
more attack from the action surge.

03:15:55.692 --> 03:15:56.705
SAM: Another one?

03:15:56.705 --> 03:15:59.936
ASHLY: Oh fuck yes, okay. Come on, baby. 20!

03:15:59.936 --> 03:16:05.071
(cheering)

03:16:05.071 --> 03:16:06.175
SAM: It took six attacks!

03:16:06.175 --> 03:16:10.593
ASHLY: So what happens when I crit?

03:16:10.593 --> 03:16:12.574
MATT: Roll your dice and double it.

03:16:12.574 --> 03:16:16.800
ASHLY: Double the dice. So then that's five--

03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:19.423
MATT: That's ten. Ten plus your modifier.

03:16:19.423 --> 03:16:21.351
ASHLY: Ten plus my mod-- 14.

03:16:21.351 --> 03:16:22.815
MATT: 14 points of damage.

03:16:22.815 --> 03:16:24.108
ASHLY: But then I roll--?

03:16:24.108 --> 03:16:25.658
LIAM: What is it normally?

03:16:25.658 --> 03:16:27.074
ASHLY: A 1d8 plus four.

03:16:27.074 --> 03:16:31.536
MATT: You rolled a five, you double that to ten
and then add the four. So 14 damage on a single

03:16:31.536 --> 03:16:39.631
hit. With that one final burst of interior
strength and adrenaline kicks in and you slam

03:16:39.631 --> 03:16:44.847
twice into the body of Wohn on the ground, the
wind knocked out of her. Her eyes go wild for a

03:16:44.847 --> 03:16:50.302
second before focusing on you, the anger and
hatred brewing in her face as her brow furrows.

03:16:50.302 --> 03:16:53.129
That, I believe, is all you can do on your turn.

03:16:53.129 --> 03:16:54.417
TALIESIN: Do you have a little bit more--?

03:16:54.417 --> 03:16:59.959
ASHLY: I've got ten more feet of movement?
(laughing) Okay, I'm going to try to get away from

03:16:59.959 --> 03:17:00.931
her. I'm going to go--

03:17:00.931 --> 03:17:01.702
LIAM: Zip!

03:17:01.702 --> 03:17:02.802
ASHLY: You know I'm going to go back.

03:17:02.802 --> 03:17:03.587
SAM: Yeah!

03:17:03.587 --> 03:17:05.193
SUMALEE: Love it!

03:17:05.193 --> 03:17:11.404
MATT: She does get an attack of opportunity on
you, swinging from the ground towards you. She is

03:17:11.404 --> 03:17:18.279
prone so she has disadvantage on the attack roll,
but she's going to try. That's going to be 14?

03:17:18.279 --> 03:17:19.373
ASHLY: No, doesn't hit.

03:17:19.373 --> 03:17:23.354
MATT: Yeah. It clangs against the back of your
armor and you manage to get out of the way.

03:17:23.354 --> 03:17:24.003
ASHLY: Whoa!

03:17:24.003 --> 03:17:27.137
MATT: Top of the round is Beau!

03:17:27.655 --> 03:17:33.153
MARISHA: Okay, where's Nott? Nott's over here?

03:17:33.153 --> 03:17:34.608
MATT: Nott's right there on the other side.

03:17:34.608 --> 03:17:36.604
MARISHA: I'm going to run around.

03:17:36.604 --> 03:17:40.616
SAM: I fire three crossbow bolts.

03:17:40.616 --> 03:17:43.682
MARISHA: That was my 40 feet?

03:17:43.682 --> 03:17:45.529
MATT: Oh, 40 feet sorry.

03:17:45.529 --> 03:17:48.313
MARISHA: I have 40. No, I'm getting to Nott.

03:17:48.313 --> 03:17:50.101
MATT: There you go, that's your 40 feet.

03:17:50.101 --> 03:17:52.570
MARISHA: I go-- (laughing)

03:17:52.570 --> 03:17:53.613
SAM: Hey girl!

03:17:53.613 --> 03:17:54.474
MARISHA: Holy shit!

03:17:54.474 --> 03:18:00.229
MATT: By the way, in the background still
(fireworks exploding).

03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:01.409
MARISHA: I did that.

03:18:01.409 --> 03:18:03.682
SAM: Have you been treating Caleb well?

03:18:03.682 --> 03:18:09.337
MARISHA: What? Do you need to get to the thing? To
pick the lock?

03:18:09.337 --> 03:18:11.512
SAM: Yeah I think it's around that way? I don't
know.

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:15.329
MARISHA: Okay! I think I know where it is. I scoop
up Nott.

03:18:15.329 --> 03:18:16.723
SAM: (yells)

03:18:16.723 --> 03:18:21.726
MATT: All right, you're not quite against-- you're
ten feet from Nott right now.

03:18:21.726 --> 03:18:23.454
MARISHA: Slap fight!

03:18:23.454 --> 03:18:29.190
MATT: That's your full movement. You have to use a
dash action if you wanted to try and you move at

03:18:29.190 --> 03:18:31.634
half speed carrying Nott.

03:18:31.634 --> 03:18:33.396
LIAM: There's nobody to attack.

03:18:33.396 --> 03:18:40.485
SAM: I have free will and I could follow you. Just
say, "Follow me."

03:18:40.485 --> 03:18:45.601
MARISHA: But then we have to wait until your turn.
Or I could just scoop you up and drag you a little

03:18:45.601 --> 03:18:47.439
bit and go that direction!

03:18:47.439 --> 03:18:48.655
MATT: What are you going to do?

03:18:48.655 --> 03:18:50.790
MARISHA: I'm going to do that! I'm going to dash.

03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:52.345
MATT: You dash. That's five--

03:18:52.345 --> 03:18:53.739
MARISHA: Come here!

03:18:53.739 --> 03:18:54.925
SAM: (yells)

03:18:54.925 --> 03:19:04.956
MATT: (counting) There you go. So you get Nott
about there.

03:19:04.956 --> 03:19:05.708
SAM: Thanks.

03:19:05.708 --> 03:19:14.037
MARISHA: I'm going to spend-- do I want to do
this? Yeah, I'm going to spend a ki point to do

03:19:14.037 --> 03:19:21.481
that thing that makes me move fast. Step of the
Wind, yes.

03:19:21.481 --> 03:19:22.274
LIAM: Cocaine.

03:19:22.274 --> 03:19:25.986
MATT: (counting) You manage to drag Nott to the
door.

03:19:26.425 --> 03:19:28.688
MARISHA: Can I open the door? Is there enough
room?

03:19:28.688 --> 03:19:30.312
MATT: It's locked.

03:19:30.312 --> 03:19:33.929
MARISHA: Locked. Okay, it's through this door,
though!

03:19:33.929 --> 03:19:35.251
SAM: How do you know?

03:19:35.251 --> 03:19:37.992
MARISHA: Because I ran by it earlier.

03:19:37.992 --> 03:19:38.725
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:19:38.725 --> 03:19:43.685
MARISHA: I remember from Nila describing it. I
took really detailed notes.

03:19:43.685 --> 03:19:44.871
MATT: Caleb.

03:19:44.871 --> 03:19:46.627
LIAM: Oh, my turn?

03:19:46.627 --> 03:19:47.277
MATT: Yes.

03:19:47.277 --> 03:19:54.118
LIAM: Oh jeez louise. Okay, I'm going to move
forward, back towards where I see Nila in there.

03:19:54.118 --> 03:19:55.925
MATT: Ten, 15, 20.

03:19:55.925 --> 03:19:58.368
LIAM: That's as far as I can go?

03:19:58.368 --> 03:20:00.121
MATT: No, you can go two more steps if you want.

03:20:00.121 --> 03:20:03.214
LIAM: I'm going to go towards Keg.

03:20:03.214 --> 03:20:06.168
MATT: 30 right there.

03:20:06.168 --> 03:20:10.234
LIAM: Yeah, and I may do nothing, but--

03:20:10.234 --> 03:20:15.046
MATT: Damn, this new iPad is eating it on the
music.

03:20:15.046 --> 03:20:16.048
SAM: What happened?

03:20:16.048 --> 03:20:20.257
MATT: I think it's just slow. The old one
disappeared and I have to get a new one.

03:20:20.257 --> 03:20:21.870
SAM: Disappeared, like was stolen?

03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:24.635
MATT: I can't find the bag. It's fine. Don't worry
about it.

03:20:24.635 --> 03:20:30.331
LIAM: DM, can I dance back and forth like this and
see what I can see through that doorway? Can I see

03:20:30.331 --> 03:20:31.269
this one?

03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:34.461
MATT: If you wanted to go there as opposed to
there, I'll let you stand there. You can just

03:20:34.461 --> 03:20:35.863
barely see somebody on the ground.

03:20:35.863 --> 03:20:38.202
LIAM: Oh look, there's somebody laughing and
giggling on the floor.

03:20:38.202 --> 03:20:40.159
MATT: No longer laughing.

03:20:40.159 --> 03:20:41.362
LIAM: Fire Bolt.

03:20:41.362 --> 03:20:43.226
MATT: Go for it, roll for the attack with
disadvantage.

03:20:46.836 --> 03:20:48.623
ASHLY: Big money!

03:20:48.623 --> 03:20:50.731
LIAM: That is a 13.

03:20:50.731 --> 03:20:55.291
MATT: Unfortunately strikes the stone ground and
bursts into fire. No effect.

03:20:55.805 --> 03:20:56.728
LIAM: Done and done.

03:20:56.728 --> 03:21:07.317
MATT: Ending Caleb's turn. (Wohn screams). Runs
up, charging angrily, is going to reckless attack.

03:21:07.317 --> 03:21:13.118
Is going to attack twice with her greataxe against
you with reckless, so it's with advantage on both

03:21:13.118 --> 03:21:19.558
attacks. The first attack is a natural 20. All
right, so that's a natural 20 on the first one.

03:21:19.558 --> 03:21:25.582
Second attack is a natural 19 plus seven. So yeah,
she hits you with both. First one's a crit.

03:21:25.582 --> 03:21:27.207
ASHLY: Jesus Christ all right.

03:21:27.207 --> 03:21:37.614
MATT: That's cocked. That is going to be 12 points
of slashing damage for the first hit. The

03:21:37.614 --> 03:21:45.330
greatsword ends up striking across your chest, the
impact sending you back and Haste disappears.

03:21:45.330 --> 03:21:46.977
ASHLY, MARISHA, and SUMALEE: No!

03:21:46.977 --> 03:21:47.852
LIAM: Wait, why? What?

03:21:47.852 --> 03:21:48.867
MARISHA: Because she has Yasha's--

03:21:48.867 --> 03:21:50.463
MATT: She has Yasha's sword and dispelled it.

03:21:50.463 --> 03:21:57.662
LIAM: (gasps) You motherfucker, Matthew Mercer. We
will have words about the rules that exist.

03:21:57.662 --> 03:22:01.719
MATT: Then swings back with a second strike
towards you and impacts.

03:22:01.719 --> 03:22:02.362
LIAM: Wow.

03:22:02.362 --> 03:22:10.576
MATT: That's going to be 13 points of slashing
damage. The second strike against you with the

03:22:10.576 --> 03:22:15.007
greatsword, the flash of white energy, you see the
runes on the hilt suddenly spark and that

03:22:15.007 --> 03:22:18.653
adrenaline in your body suddenly fades and your
body becomes super lethargic and you are stunned

03:22:18.653 --> 03:22:19.959
for your next turn.

03:22:19.959 --> 03:22:21.018
ASHLY: I'm stunned?!

03:22:21.018 --> 03:22:23.054
MATT: The Haste has faded and your body is
drained.

03:22:23.054 --> 03:22:26.004
LIAM: It's dispelled, but the stun still happens?

03:22:26.004 --> 03:22:28.128
MATT: As soon as Haste ends, your body--

03:22:28.128 --> 03:22:29.643
LIAM: That's some bullshit, Matthew.

03:22:29.643 --> 03:22:31.650
MATT: That's how it works, that's the downside of
the spell, man!

03:22:31.650 --> 03:22:34.609
LIAM: Whatever you say, but still that's some
bullshit.

03:22:34.609 --> 03:22:37.493
ASHLY: So I just can't do anything on my next
turn.

03:22:37.493 --> 03:22:38.710
MATT: Next turn you can't do anything.

03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:40.042
LIAM: Yeah, it's wasted.

03:22:40.042 --> 03:22:41.112
MATT: Nila, you're up.

03:22:41.112 --> 03:22:42.301
SUMALEE: Okay.

03:22:42.301 --> 03:22:45.445
ASHLY: Oh man, I'm going to get <i>rocked</i>.

03:22:45.445 --> 03:22:49.393
SAM: Don't worry, you have a totally squishy
wizard standing behind you. He'll protect you.

03:22:49.393 --> 03:22:51.109
(laughter)

03:22:51.109 --> 03:22:58.641
SUMALEE: That's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking
yes, the wizard will protect Keg.

03:22:58.641 --> 03:23:00.146
SAM and TALIESIN: Sure.

03:23:00.146 --> 03:23:05.888
SUMALEE: I've got to go toward the trapdoor. Can
I go through that door?

03:23:05.888 --> 03:23:09.593
MATT: Currently, you walk up and try the door.
It's locked.

03:23:09.593 --> 03:23:13.035
SUMALEE: I don't have the strength to (grunts)?

03:23:14.062 --> 03:23:17.352
MATT: Make a strength check. Roll a d20 and roll
your strength modifier.

03:23:17.352 --> 03:23:19.171
MARISHA: Come on firbolg!

03:23:19.171 --> 03:23:21.210
SUMALEE: 17?

03:23:21.210 --> 03:23:22.049
MATT: Plus?

03:23:22.049 --> 03:23:22.845
SUMALEE: Two!

03:23:22.845 --> 03:23:31.372
MATT: Plus two? 19? You force your shoulder
against it and it doesn't give. The feeling and

03:23:31.372 --> 03:23:36.403
the sensation of knowing your family is nearby
surges in your body and you pull back a few more

03:23:36.403 --> 03:23:42.496
steps and then charge in. With one aggressive
(yells), the door flips open. The actual handle

03:23:42.496 --> 03:23:45.068
itself breaking and snapping on the wood.

03:23:45.068 --> 03:23:46.491
ASHLY: It's like a mom lifting a car.

03:23:46.491 --> 03:23:52.215
MATT: Essentially. With a 19, that's exactly what
it is. That door is now open and you step through

03:23:52.215 --> 03:23:54.028
and join the rest of them.

03:23:54.028 --> 03:23:55.495
SAM: (yells)

03:23:55.495 --> 03:23:57.011
MARISHA: No, Nott, no!

03:23:57.011 --> 03:23:59.826
SAM: (yelling) Do you know Pumat Sol?

03:23:59.826 --> 03:24:06.251
(laughter)

03:24:06.251 --> 03:24:08.284
SUMALEE: Can I still cast or can I do a bonus
thing?

03:24:08.284 --> 03:24:12.124
MATT: You can do a bonus action thing, yes, but
your action has been used to break through the door.

03:24:12.124 --> 03:24:18.280
SUMALEE: Okay. Now I'm going to protect the three
of us, at least the three of us for now. Unless I

03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:22.621
get Caleb too with the bear spirit totem.

03:24:22.621 --> 03:24:27.302
MATT: You could drop it there. As a matter of
fact, everybody except for Keg and Clay.

03:24:27.302 --> 03:24:30.261
SUMALEE: Ten extra hit points, advantage on
strength checks.

03:24:30.261 --> 03:24:31.784
MATT: Ten temporary hit points.

03:24:31.784 --> 03:24:35.268
SUMALEE: Temporary hit points, advantage on
strength and saving throws.

03:24:35.268 --> 03:24:40.585
TALIESIN: Is it anybody who steps into that field
now, or is it just whoever's in the field when it drops?

03:24:40.585 --> 03:24:42.581
MARISHA: Advantage on strength and what?

03:24:42.581 --> 03:24:44.190
SUMALEE: Saving throws.

03:24:44.190 --> 03:24:45.942
SAM: Wow.

03:24:45.942 --> 03:24:47.431
LIAM: On all saving throws?

03:24:47.431 --> 03:24:49.653
MATT: When the spirit appears, so you guys do not
get it, unfortunately.

03:24:49.653 --> 03:24:52.181
TALIESIN: Okay, so you're still fucked. Goddamn
it.

03:24:52.181 --> 03:24:58.574
MATT: So ten temporary hit points to Caleb, Nila,
Nott, and Beau for the next minute.

03:24:58.574 --> 03:25:00.853
LIAM: The hit points are phenomenal.

03:25:00.853 --> 03:25:03.773
SUMALEE: I could've done the hawk because of what
happened with Molly I--

03:25:03.773 --> 03:25:06.095
MARISHA: No, this is great. You're great.

03:25:06.095 --> 03:25:09.182
MATT: That ends Nila's turn. Nott you're up.

03:25:09.182 --> 03:25:14.909
SAM: I'm going to try and pick this-- is the door
locked? Did we try the door? Did you try the door?

03:25:14.909 --> 03:25:15.813
MARISHA: I did.

03:25:15.813 --> 03:25:16.700
MATT: The door is locked, yes.

03:25:16.700 --> 03:25:21.567
SAM: Okay, I will Mage Hand pick the lock as a
bonus action.

03:25:21.567 --> 03:25:22.747
MATT: Okay.

03:25:22.747 --> 03:25:25.057
SAM: Terrible, 13.

03:25:25.057 --> 03:25:29.524
MATT: The Mage Hand doesn't have the delicate
touch.

03:25:29.524 --> 03:25:30.846
MARISHA: You have such bad luck with this.

03:25:30.846 --> 03:25:35.569
SAM: I know. Action! I will also try to pick the
lock. Worse.

03:25:35.569 --> 03:25:40.963
LIAM: Oh no! Come on!

03:25:40.963 --> 03:25:46.373
MARISHA: This is how Molly died! You trying to
pick locks!

03:25:46.373 --> 03:25:50.596
SAM: I know! I don't know what's wrong with me!

03:25:50.596 --> 03:25:57.051
LIAM: Maybe if we offer Taliesin's new character
in exchange for our lives, we can get out of this.

03:25:57.051 --> 03:25:59.959
ASHLY: No one's gotten attached to him yet,
right?

03:25:59.959 --> 03:26:04.436
SUMALEE: I have! Nila has!

03:26:04.436 --> 03:26:06.285
MATT: I kind of have, too.

03:26:06.285 --> 03:26:07.673
TALIESIN: I can roll another one.

03:26:07.673 --> 03:26:09.458
LIAM: You know you want to roll a halfling
sorcerer, come on!

03:26:09.458 --> 03:26:10.800
MATT: So that's your action and your bonus action.

03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:11.911
ASHLY: I'm attached, too.

03:26:11.911 --> 03:26:15.377
SAM: That's all I can do, right? I can just move.

03:26:15.377 --> 03:26:17.881
MATT: Yeah you can move, if you wish to.

03:26:17.881 --> 03:26:24.149
SAM: There's nowhere to move, so I'll hang out by
the door, maybe try to tuck behind someone bigger

03:26:24.149 --> 03:26:24.912
than me?

03:26:24.912 --> 03:26:28.403
MATT: Okay. Clay, it's you and the horses. What
are you doing?

03:26:28.403 --> 03:26:31.260
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in the door.

03:26:31.260 --> 03:26:32.549
MATT: 15, 20.

03:26:32.549 --> 03:26:35.622
TALIESIN: Okay, that's what I see? There's an open
door. I'm going to the open door.

03:26:35.622 --> 03:26:37.036
LIAM: We just destroyed the door.

03:26:37.036 --> 03:26:40.521
MATT: 30. You're so big, this was not designed for
his firbolg form.

03:26:40.521 --> 03:26:41.316
TALIESIN: Hey, guys.

03:26:41.316 --> 03:26:42.571
MATT: That's your movement.

03:26:42.571 --> 03:26:44.297
TALIESIN: I don't see anything. I'm going to keep
running.

03:26:44.297 --> 03:26:52.677
MATT: (counting) You walk into this chamber and
you see everybody else. You also see this weird

03:26:52.677 --> 03:26:58.192
spectral bear spirit that seems to have apparated
in the center of this hallway that looks at you

03:26:58.192 --> 03:27:01.530
and goes (bear growls).

03:27:01.530 --> 03:27:06.794
TALIESIN: Hey. Can I see the barbarian through the
door?

03:27:06.794 --> 03:27:10.527
MATT: You can! You glance over and take in the
scene. That's your movement and your action.

03:27:10.527 --> 03:27:11.980
TALIESIN: So I only have a bonus?

03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:13.373
MATT: Correct.

03:27:13.373 --> 03:27:18.443
TALIESIN: Hold on. I'm learning how this works. I
can cast Healing Word.

03:27:18.443 --> 03:27:19.687
MATT: You can, yeah.

03:27:19.687 --> 03:27:20.739
TALIESIN: On you.

03:27:20.739 --> 03:27:21.485
SAM: Phil?

03:27:21.485 --> 03:27:27.056
TALIESIN: Yeah! No, on you, of course. I see that
this is going down and I'm going to cast a quick

03:27:27.056 --> 03:27:28.603
Healing Word. That's--

03:27:28.603 --> 03:27:30.961
MATT: A d4 plus your wisdom modifier.

03:27:30.961 --> 03:27:33.409
TALIESIN: 1d4 plus my wisdom modifier.

03:27:33.409 --> 03:27:38.238
SAM: A cleric who likes to heal? This is amazing.

03:27:38.238 --> 03:27:40.312
TALIESIN: Six points immediately to you.

03:27:40.312 --> 03:27:41.565
ASHLY: Okay, thank you.

03:27:41.565 --> 03:27:45.394
LIAM and MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:27:45.394 --> 03:27:46.452
TALIESIN: All right.

03:27:46.452 --> 03:27:47.541
MATT: That's your turn?

03:27:47.541 --> 03:27:49.698
TALIESIN: Yep, that's everything I've got.

03:27:49.698 --> 03:27:51.060
MATT: Keg, you're up.

03:27:51.060 --> 03:27:53.128
ASHLY: Well. Oh, I can--

03:27:53.128 --> 03:27:56.281
MATT: You can't do anything because you're
stunned.

03:27:56.281 --> 03:27:58.025
ASHLY: I'm stunned! Fuck, I forgot. Never mind!

03:27:58.025 --> 03:28:00.120
MATT: That's the end of your turn. Top of the
round, Beau.

03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:03.483
MARISHA: Oh! Okay, it's me.

03:28:03.483 --> 03:28:04.962
LIAM: (singing) Welcome back.

03:28:04.962 --> 03:28:12.441
MARISHA: Shit! What's the quickest way through?
Can I get through everybody and go this way? Yeah,

03:28:12.441 --> 03:28:20.070
I'm going to do that. Excuse, me. Sorry. Pardon
me. Excuse me.

03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:24.730
MATT: You're still 15 feet from Wohn.

03:28:24.730 --> 03:28:33.684
MARISHA: Okay, can I step back a few feet? I don't
want to go that full movement, maybe on top of the

03:28:33.684 --> 03:28:35.251
table. Can I get on top of the table?

03:28:35.251 --> 03:28:36.580
MATT: If you want to be on there instead, yeah.

03:28:36.580 --> 03:28:42.944
MARISHA: That's cool. I want to gauge it right
over Keg's shoulders and throw two darts.

03:28:42.944 --> 03:28:46.599
MATT: Okay, you're going to attempt to ricochet
off of her armor. Go for it.

03:28:46.599 --> 03:28:52.341
MARISHA: Over top of her shoulders to the giant
barbarian behind her? Hopefully?

03:28:52.341 --> 03:28:53.299
MATT: Go for it.

03:28:53.299 --> 03:28:55.150
MARISHA: Or ricochet, whatever's the coolest.

03:28:55.150 --> 03:28:56.707
MATT: I'm just embellishing for fun. Why not?

03:28:56.707 --> 03:28:57.524
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:28:57.524 --> 03:28:59.185
MATT: We'll see if it works.

03:28:59.185 --> 03:29:01.168
MARISHA: Okay, first one: 17?

03:29:01.168 --> 03:29:04.380
MATT: 17 hits. Actually, you have an advantage,
technically, because she was doing reckless

03:29:04.380 --> 03:29:06.185
attacks last turn.

03:29:06.185 --> 03:29:07.454
MARISHA: 13 on the higher one. That's a 20.

03:29:07.454 --> 03:29:09.440
MATT: That hits. First one hits.

03:29:09.440 --> 03:29:12.459
MARISHA: What do these do? These do a d8 damage?
These do monk or do these--?

03:29:12.459 --> 03:29:15.187
MATT: These are the--

03:29:15.187 --> 03:29:18.518
MARISHA: These are the-- no, these still do 1d4,
right?

03:29:18.518 --> 03:29:20.293
MATT: These are still darts, they're modified
darts. You would need to get daggers or things

03:29:20.293 --> 03:29:22.701
that are considered monk weapons to do additional
damage.

03:29:23.191 --> 03:29:26.268
MARISHA: So the first one is crap. That's five
damage.

03:29:26.268 --> 03:29:28.798
MATT: Five damage. Second one, with advantage
still.

03:29:28.798 --> 03:29:30.788
MARISHA: My second one. 21.

03:29:30.788 --> 03:29:32.577
MATT: 21 hits. Roll damage.

03:29:32.577 --> 03:29:35.278
MARISHA: Ooh, that's better. Eight damage.

03:29:36.768 --> 03:29:42.987
MATT: Five and eight. As you're there, getting
your brain back in the space and the strength

03:29:42.987 --> 03:29:46.513
returns to you. You look up at the time the
barbarian is pulling back for another round of

03:29:46.513 --> 03:29:55.185
blows, the giant blade still crimson with your own
blood. These two serrated blade-like discs into

03:29:55.185 --> 03:29:59.162
her chest from over your shoulders. You glance
over quickly and see Beau waving to you through

03:29:59.162 --> 03:30:01.030
the doorway.

03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:04.873
ASHLY: I don't need to say it, but Keg is
aroused.

03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:06.846
MATT: All righty, that finishes Beau's turn.
Caleb, you're up.

03:30:06.846 --> 03:30:08.829
SAM: (singing) Lady boner!

03:30:08.829 --> 03:30:10.314
MARISHA: I just give a wink.

03:30:10.314 --> 03:30:13.873
SAM: Clang!

03:30:13.873 --> 03:30:21.199
(laughter)

03:30:21.199 --> 03:30:29.346
LIAM: Wow. I have a joke, I'm going to keep it in
my head. This is all going much worse than I

03:30:29.346 --> 03:30:36.066
intended it to, so I am going to tug on the glove
and I'm going to slap it and send out three--

03:30:36.066 --> 03:30:37.751
SAM: Is that the fly?

03:30:37.751 --> 03:30:38.737
MARISHA: Fucking fly!

03:30:38.737 --> 03:30:45.308
LIAM: Get him. Beauregard, you're the monk.
Scorching Ray, three times on the barbarian. First

03:30:45.308 --> 03:30:46.673
one is shit.

03:30:46.673 --> 03:30:49.870
MATT: Well, technically, you don't have advantage.
It's advantage on melee attacks, not ranged

03:30:50.522 --> 03:30:51.458
attacks, but it's fine.

03:30:51.458 --> 03:30:56.157
LIAM: Second is a 15. First is total shit, second
is a 15.

03:30:56.157 --> 03:30:57.461
MATT: 15 hits.

03:30:57.461 --> 03:31:00.711
LIAM: Third is better than that.

03:31:00.711 --> 03:31:02.092
MATT: So two hits.

03:31:02.092 --> 03:31:10.912
LIAM: That is eight for the first and eight for
the second.

03:31:10.912 --> 03:31:23.971
MATT: Nice! Oof. That'll be enough. How do you
want to do this, Caleb?

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:24.847
MARISHA: Yes!

03:31:24.847 --> 03:31:30.039
LIAM: I have had very bad luck with people's
skulls, so I am going to send the fire into her

03:31:30.039 --> 03:31:38.151
thighs and legs and burn the bottom of her torso
and even the center of her being, her stomach, and

03:31:38.151 --> 03:31:43.908
make it burn in upon itself and harden in
blackened crust.

03:31:43.908 --> 03:31:44.803
SAM: Ugh!

03:31:44.803 --> 03:31:51.578
MATT: She screams out in pain, the flesh itself
burning black instantly and cracking as she falls

03:31:51.578 --> 03:31:58.695
to the ground screaming. The voice slowly thins
out into a faint (death rattle) before expiring.

03:31:58.695 --> 03:32:02.038
Need you to make a wisdom saving throw, Caleb.

03:32:02.038 --> 03:32:04.134
SAM: Wisdom saving-- oh, because fire.

03:32:04.134 --> 03:32:08.978
LIAM: That's a 13.

03:32:09.565 --> 03:32:16.839
MATT: 13. You take a moment, and push through, and
keep your wits about you.

03:32:16.839 --> 03:32:20.471
LIAM: That's the first time I did that. First time
I did <i>not</i> go into a state.

03:32:20.471 --> 03:32:21.171
SAM: Wow.

03:32:21.171 --> 03:32:24.926
LIAM: (breathing heavily)

03:32:24.926 --> 03:32:28.068
MARISHA: Beau turns around to Caleb and goes:
Damn, Caleb.

03:32:28.068 --> 03:32:33.832
MATT: The firecrackers have ended. Silence comes
over the fortress.

03:32:33.832 --> 03:32:37.373
SAM: Nobody else is coming?

03:32:37.373 --> 03:32:39.072
MATT: None that you see or hear.

03:32:39.072 --> 03:32:42.629
LIAM: Stay alert. We're not done here.

03:32:42.629 --> 03:32:45.450
SAM: Go back to lock-a-pickin'?

03:32:45.450 --> 03:32:46.803
MATT: Go for it.

03:32:46.803 --> 03:32:49.253
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to you and give
you some healing.

03:32:49.253 --> 03:32:50.739
ASHLY: Oh, you are the best!

03:32:50.739 --> 03:32:52.284
MATT: DC is getting higher with each.

03:32:52.284 --> 03:32:53.228
SAM: 15.

03:32:53.228 --> 03:32:54.474
MATT: Total of 15?

03:32:54.474 --> 03:32:55.729
SAM: Yeah.

03:32:55.729 --> 03:33:00.890
MATT: It's not going through. This is a very
intricate lock. It's obviously protecting a lot.

03:33:00.890 --> 03:33:02.534
SAM: Nila, I need you!

03:33:02.534 --> 03:33:03.896
SUMALEE: Can I muscle my way through?

03:33:03.896 --> 03:33:04.875
LIAM: Wait for me.

03:33:04.875 --> 03:33:07.290
MATT: Make a strength check, if you want to. You
still have advantage on the strength checks

03:33:07.290 --> 03:33:08.925
because you're a bear for the time being.

03:33:08.925 --> 03:33:12.904
MARISHA: Do it! Yes! Okay, one more. Do a second
one.

03:33:12.904 --> 03:33:14.603
MATT: Roll it one more time.

03:33:14.603 --> 03:33:16.089
MARISHA: That's better?

03:33:16.089 --> 03:33:16.802
SUMALEE: No.

03:33:16.802 --> 03:33:21.621
MATT: The door is too strong. This one is actually
reinforced and seems to-- knowing what it's

03:33:21.621 --> 03:33:25.052
hiding-- designed to be the strongest door on this
floor.

03:33:25.052 --> 03:33:26.714
LIAM: Nott, wait for me.

03:33:26.714 --> 03:33:27.591
TALIESIN: 12 points to you.

03:33:27.591 --> 03:33:29.794
SAM: Come, quickly!

03:33:29.794 --> 03:33:32.470
ASHLY: I follow too.

03:33:32.470 --> 03:33:35.897
SAM: Everyone stand back! Caleb's going to do a
thing.

03:33:35.897 --> 03:33:39.725
MARISHA: I'm going to watch this front door and
make sure no one else comes down the steps.

03:33:39.725 --> 03:33:40.998
MATT: Over here?

03:33:40.998 --> 03:33:42.078
MARISHA: No, here.

03:33:42.078 --> 03:33:47.109
SAM: (stammering) Get the sword!

03:33:47.109 --> 03:33:49.264
ASHLY: Oh, the sword? I'll grab the sword, then.

03:33:49.264 --> 03:33:51.738
MARISHA: Yeah, get the sword. Sword in the
haversack.

03:33:51.738 --> 03:33:56.552
MATT: Grab the sword. You pull the sheath off her
back and slip it in the haversack.

03:33:56.552 --> 03:33:58.630
TALIESIN: Anything else worth checking?

03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:59.386
MARISHA: What?

03:33:59.386 --> 03:34:00.824
LIAM: Attune to the sword.

03:34:00.824 --> 03:34:02.235
MARISHA: No, I'm putting it in the haversack.

03:34:02.235 --> 03:34:03.647
ASHLY: Before I leave, could I investigate--

03:34:03.647 --> 03:34:04.641
MARISHA: It's Yasha's sword.

03:34:04.641 --> 03:34:06.253
ASHLY: --to see if I see anything else worth
taking?

03:34:06.253 --> 03:34:08.547
MATT: If you'd like to. It takes a moment for you
to rifle through her stuff.

03:34:08.547 --> 03:34:10.511
ASHLY: I'll do that. What is that check?

03:34:10.511 --> 03:34:11.495
MATT: Investigation.

03:34:11.495 --> 03:34:13.424
ASHLY: That's a 14.

03:34:13.424 --> 03:34:23.317
MATT: 14? Okay. You manage to find about 38 gold
pieces in the pouch that she keeps on her side.

03:34:23.317 --> 03:34:31.370
You find another pouch that is a bunch of dried
meats that have been salted and smoked, like a

03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:37.977
jerky. You also find another pack that has teeth
in it. Just a collection of teeth. Different

03:34:37.977 --> 03:34:39.427
sizes, different ages.

03:34:39.427 --> 03:34:41.056
ASHLY: No keys or anything like that?

03:34:41.056 --> 03:34:41.881
MATT: No keys.

03:34:41.881 --> 03:34:42.883
ASHLY: Okay.

03:34:42.883 --> 03:34:49.045
TALIESIN: I'm going to start walking to any of the
dead bodies and-- or the unconscious people who

03:34:49.045 --> 03:34:50.625
are not technically dead yet.

03:34:50.625 --> 03:34:52.125
MATT: They've bled out.

03:34:52.125 --> 03:34:56.782
TALIESIN: Oh, they bled out? All right, I'm going
to start using Thaumaturgy to start cooking them

03:34:56.782 --> 03:34:59.099
away in a big pile of mold and mushrooms.

03:34:59.099 --> 03:35:01.733
SAM: Ugh! What the fuck is wrong with you?

03:35:01.733 --> 03:35:04.947
SUMALEE: He's just returning the bodies to their
natural state.

03:35:04.947 --> 03:35:08.779
TALIESIN: Aw, it's nice to have someone who really
understands. It's the process.

03:35:08.779 --> 03:35:09.619
SUMALEE: I understand.

03:35:09.619 --> 03:35:10.523
SAM: Caleb!

03:35:10.523 --> 03:35:15.142
LIAM: I will find Nott. Have you done everything
that you could here?

03:35:15.142 --> 03:35:22.296
SAM: I'm sorry I couldn't get it open. I tried,
and I made noise, and I should've drunk <i>more,</i> is

03:35:22.296 --> 03:35:24.029
what I should've done.

03:35:24.029 --> 03:35:29.817
LIAM: We all should've drunk more. It is no shame
on you. I place my hand on the trapdoor--

03:35:29.817 --> 03:35:32.206
MATT: Not on the trapdoor, the door that leads
into it.

03:35:32.206 --> 03:35:34.000
LIAM: The door is locked?

03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:35.362
MATT: The door is locked, yeah.

03:35:35.362 --> 03:35:37.986
LIAM: I place my hand on the door and I cast
Knock.

03:35:37.986 --> 03:35:41.547
MATT: (click, creaking) The door opens.

03:35:41.547 --> 03:35:43.345
SAM: He's so amazing!

03:35:43.345 --> 03:35:45.588
TALIESIN: Pretty good, yeah.

03:35:45.588 --> 03:35:50.159
LIAM: I'm going to walk through and find that
trapdoor that I've already seen through Frumpkin's eyes.

03:35:50.159 --> 03:35:52.168
MATT: All right. You go to the trapdoor.

03:35:52.168 --> 03:35:57.591
SAM: Is it open? You want me to check it for
traps?

03:35:57.591 --> 03:35:58.818
LIAM: Yes, please.

03:35:58.818 --> 03:36:05.105
SAM: All right. I'll go check it for traps. That's
a 28. No, 26.

03:36:05.628 --> 03:36:07.508
MATT: 26? It is trapped.

03:36:07.508 --> 03:36:09.601
SAM: There's a trap!

03:36:09.601 --> 03:36:11.481
MATT: From the underside of it.

03:36:11.481 --> 03:36:16.493
LIAM: I back up about 15 feet out of this little
cubby.

03:36:16.493 --> 03:36:20.008
MARISHA: From the underside.

03:36:20.008 --> 03:36:21.349
SUMALEE: So if we open it, it will--

03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:23.376
MARISHA: It'll hurt them.

03:36:23.376 --> 03:36:27.453
SAM: Back up everybody, out of the room, and I'll
reach my mage hand around.

03:36:27.453 --> 03:36:28.821
LIAM: A reach around.

03:36:28.821 --> 03:36:37.346
SAM: A reach around. Give it a little tuggy with
the reach around. Just pull it. Pull it. Just tug

03:36:37.346 --> 03:36:46.212
it until it explodes. Just reach around and tug it
until it explodes. Just keep on working it! Might

03:36:46.212 --> 03:36:49.384
have to use the other hand for a while, that one's
getting tired, Matt!

03:36:49.384 --> 03:36:52.301
(laughter)

03:36:52.301 --> 03:36:53.615
SAM: Wait for the explosion!

03:36:53.615 --> 03:36:58.190
MATT: Roll for reach around.

03:36:58.190 --> 03:37:01.605
(laughter)

03:37:01.605 --> 03:37:02.921
SAM: What am I rolling?

03:37:02.921 --> 03:37:06.150
MATT: This is still another thieves' tools check,
so still plus seven.

03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:07.526
SAM: Okay. 22 this time.

03:37:07.526 --> 03:37:09.651
MATT: 22. That'll do it.

03:37:09.651 --> 03:37:11.312
SUMALEE: Explosion!

03:37:11.312 --> 03:37:13.191
LIAM: Your mother watches this show, right?

03:37:13.191 --> 03:37:19.424
MATT: You manage to just lift the trapdoor enough
to slide your hand underneath. There is a trigger

03:37:19.424 --> 03:37:26.539
cable underneath that has been set into a hook.
Right before it pulls taut enough for it to snap,

03:37:26.539 --> 03:37:33.066
you grab it, lift it up, put it onto a shoulder.
Using the cable, you pull it back until you find a

03:37:33.066 --> 03:37:41.528
piece of rock off to the side and hook it to it to
where it maintains the tautness. You find another

03:37:41.528 --> 03:37:48.506
metal ring that is designed specifically to hold
the trap when it's not set. It does not go off.

03:37:48.506 --> 03:37:53.163
The trapdoor opens, and there is a staircase that
descends to a lower floor.

03:37:53.163 --> 03:37:55.445
SAM: See? Just easy as that.

03:37:55.445 --> 03:37:57.198
LIAM: Is it open?

03:37:57.198 --> 03:37:59.262
SAM: It's open. Let's go in.

03:37:59.262 --> 03:38:06.367
LIAM: Open it. No. I hold up Frumpkin, I place him
on the edge of the trapdoor, and send him

03:38:06.367 --> 03:38:07.787
scrambling under to look.

03:38:07.787 --> 03:38:11.522
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

03:38:11.522 --> 03:38:15.154
MARISHA: I'm still watching this front area.

03:38:15.154 --> 03:38:15.720
LIAM: 15.

03:38:15.720 --> 03:38:23.764
MATT: 15? Okay. Frumpkin descends slowly down the
stairs. There's a faint bit of torchlight in

03:38:23.764 --> 03:38:35.216
there. You hear whimpering. A few voices faintly
whimpering. Inside the chamber-- I can show you, actually.

03:38:35.216 --> 03:38:40.702
SAM: Wait, what? No, you had the <i>upstairs</i> built,
Matt, you didn't have the downstairs built. That

03:38:40.702 --> 03:38:42.328
would be too much.

03:38:42.328 --> 03:38:44.756
MATT: I'll be right back.

03:38:44.756 --> 03:38:47.099
(groaning)

03:38:47.099 --> 03:38:49.747
SAM: Guys? D&D Beyond.

03:38:49.747 --> 03:38:52.360
LIAM: We learned so much.

03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:56.159
SAM: We've learned so much about-- Hey Taliesin,
welcome back to the show!

03:38:56.159 --> 03:38:57.792
TALIESIN: Thank you, it's great to be back.

03:38:57.792 --> 03:38:59.957
MARISHA: Will you show off your shirt? It's a
little squishy.

03:38:59.957 --> 03:39:02.035
TALIESIN: It's a little squishy.

03:39:02.035 --> 03:39:04.957
SAM: "New character, who dis?" Aw, that's great!

03:39:04.957 --> 03:39:11.550
LIAM: Last week, Taliesin was hanging like Tom
Cruise in a Mission: Impossible movie just above

03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:16.993
the table waiting to drop in, and we all thought
it would happen near the end of the episode, but

03:39:16.993 --> 03:39:22.035
it didn't. It didn't. How does it feel to finally
let that little bit of rope cut and be in the game again?

03:39:22.035 --> 03:39:27.803
TALIESIN: I've got to say, it's been a little
nerve wracking coming in as someone new. It's very interesting.

03:39:27.803 --> 03:39:28.860
LIAM: I like this guy.

03:39:28.860 --> 03:39:29.721
TALIESIN: I like this guy, too.

03:39:29.721 --> 03:39:30.647
MARISHA: I like this guy a lot.

03:39:30.647 --> 03:39:31.460
ASHLY: He's awesome.

03:39:31.460 --> 03:39:32.385
SAM: His voice is sexy.

03:39:32.385 --> 03:39:33.656
ASHLY: He had such a great intro.

03:39:33.656 --> 03:39:36.102
LIAM: I like pink more than purple, if I can say.

03:39:36.102 --> 03:39:38.003
TALIESIN: I like it all, so I'm a fan.

03:39:38.003 --> 03:39:40.513
MARISHA: Do you really like pink more than purple?
Like, as a person?

03:39:40.513 --> 03:39:41.102
LIAM: Yes.

03:39:41.102 --> 03:39:44.638
MARISHA: I can't tell if you're lying to me or
not.

03:39:44.638 --> 03:39:46.908
LIAM: I like pink a little more than purple.

03:39:46.908 --> 03:39:51.382
TALIESIN: I was very happy with the pink mohawk.
It was a very good mohawk. It was black-light reactive.

03:39:51.382 --> 03:39:52.475
ASHLY: Really?

03:39:52.475 --> 03:39:54.052
SAM: Oh, Matt's back!

03:39:54.052 --> 03:40:03.419
MATT: So hi guys. Frumpkin slowly descends the
staircase, and you can see a rack that is bolted

03:40:03.419 --> 03:40:13.761
into the wall that has chains hanging from it, a
few other sets of manacles, a few torture

03:40:13.761 --> 03:40:24.465
implements: long metal things that are hooked at
the end, brands. There are a few spaces that are

03:40:24.465 --> 03:40:29.412
currently empty where tools probably would
normally hang, and there is another door that

03:40:29.412 --> 03:40:32.882
leads to a chamber beyond, and that's where you
hear the whimpering coming from.

03:40:32.882 --> 03:40:37.036
LIAM: What I don't like about this is that the
asshole was sleeping upstairs and we don't know

03:40:37.036 --> 03:40:46.456
about that at all, but I send Frumpkin along the
ceiling and through-- that looks like a barred gate.

03:40:46.456 --> 03:41:01.751
MATT: As Frumpkin looks within, you can see
another chamber. You can see another hired figure,

03:41:01.751 --> 03:41:07.405
at least the same cloaked individuals you had
encountered before, same attire, who is currently

03:41:07.405 --> 03:41:12.745
sitting at the back, up against the wall, and is
looking in the direction of the door expectantly.

03:41:12.745 --> 03:41:18.014
LIAM: I will attempt to send Frumpkin over his
head along the ceiling stealthily.

03:41:18.014 --> 03:41:23.461
MATT: Make a stealth check for Frumpkin. Frumpkin
also noticed there is a cage in the corner that

03:41:23.461 --> 03:41:26.724
contains two figures in there. Looks to be two
humanoid figures.

03:41:26.724 --> 03:41:28.302
LIAM: Humanoid, that's it?

03:41:28.302 --> 03:41:33.358
MATT: With that perception roll and the low light,
it's hard to tell. One appears to be larger, one

03:41:33.358 --> 03:41:34.781
appears to be smaller.

03:41:34.781 --> 03:41:36.403
SAM: Yasha and Jester,

03:41:36.403 --> 03:41:39.718
LIAM: I'm going to keep going and you said roll--

03:41:39.718 --> 03:41:40.879
MATT: Make a stealth check.

03:41:40.879 --> 03:41:46.613
LIAM: Very good, that is a 19.

03:41:46.613 --> 03:41:56.003
MATT: Okay. Unnoticing, he sits there waiting, arm
against the wall. Frumpkin slowly makes his way

03:41:56.074 --> 03:42:03.915
through this hallway. It bends off on a corner
around the side. Frumpkin continues beyond and it

03:42:03.915 --> 03:42:11.166
curves around another corner here. There is an
archway that leads into another room that has two

03:42:11.166 --> 03:42:16.421
more cages that contain-- each cage contains
another figure. The figures in there appear to be

03:42:16.421 --> 03:42:19.273
slumped down and either unconscious or sleeping.

03:42:19.273 --> 03:42:23.552
LIAM: Yeah, he pauses, he's looking for green or
blue or goth.

03:42:23.552 --> 03:42:25.692
MATT: Here?

03:42:25.692 --> 03:42:26.711
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

03:42:26.711 --> 03:42:36.273
MATT: You see Ruzza and Protto, two more members
of The Iron Shepherds that are currently waiting

03:42:36.273 --> 03:42:43.735
there with their eyes towards the entryway
expectantly. It seems that they have been notified

03:42:43.735 --> 03:42:45.158
of your presence.

03:42:45.158 --> 03:42:46.323
SAM: How?

03:42:46.323 --> 03:42:50.458
MATT: I don't know, maybe the loud firecrackers
going off right above?

03:42:50.458 --> 03:42:59.193
TALIESIN: What do they do, those two? What do
those two do?

03:42:59.193 --> 03:43:02.005
SAM: They're bad. One's a magic person.

03:43:02.005 --> 03:43:04.078
LIAM: So would Frumpkin be at the edge of that
gate?

03:43:04.078 --> 03:43:06.689
MATT: Frumpkin would be here.

03:43:06.689 --> 03:43:11.784
LIAM: I rolled a 19 last we checked and that was
20 seconds ago.

03:43:11.784 --> 03:43:21.054
MATT: As they're both standing there waiting,
Protto, the little halfling sharpshooter creep,

03:43:21.054 --> 03:43:28.361
glances up and goes, takes his shortbow and--

03:43:28.407 --> 03:43:30.219
LIAM: Do I see this?

03:43:30.219 --> 03:43:33.035
MATT: Pulls it off his shoulder. Mm-hmm.

03:43:33.035 --> 03:43:35.239
LIAM: (popping)

03:43:35.239 --> 03:43:37.085
MATT: Yeah, that's the last you see.

03:43:37.085 --> 03:43:45.432
LIAM: There are more people down there. This is
the x-factor we spoke about.

03:43:45.432 --> 03:43:47.847
MARISHA: How many?

03:43:47.847 --> 03:43:50.197
LIAM: I saw two down there, correct?

03:43:50.197 --> 03:43:51.589
ASHLY: Three, right?

03:43:51.589 --> 03:43:53.632
MATT: One in that chamber and then two in there.

03:43:53.632 --> 03:43:55.322
LIAM: Right, but I mean in that last room.

03:43:55.322 --> 03:43:56.655
MATT: In that last room it was two.

03:43:56.655 --> 03:43:59.503
LIAM: And I did not see Lazlo, so he could be
upstairs.

03:43:59.503 --> 03:44:00.734
SAM: Lorenzo.

03:44:00.734 --> 03:44:02.157
LIAM: No, it's Lazlo, I'm pretty sure.

03:44:02.157 --> 03:44:04.074
(laughter)

03:44:04.074 --> 03:44:11.396
LIAM: I didn't see <i>el boogie</i> down there so he
could be upstairs or downstairs, is what I'm saying.

03:44:11.396 --> 03:44:15.375
SAM: But then you saw some prisoners?

03:44:15.375 --> 03:44:23.190
ASHLY: Dwelma's dead, we just beat the barbarian,
Protto and Ruzza are down there, that means

03:44:23.190 --> 03:44:24.844
Lorenzo is upstairs, unless he's--

03:44:24.844 --> 03:44:25.995
SAM: Or somewhere.

03:44:25.995 --> 03:44:34.570
LIAM: We do not know that. We know that there is
one random shithead and two more beyond that, and

03:44:34.570 --> 03:44:37.944
I did not see Lorenzo or Lazlo or Larkin.

03:44:37.944 --> 03:44:39.801
ASHLY: Lorenzo.

03:44:39.801 --> 03:44:43.280
MARISHA: So he's either still upstairs or deeper,
further.

03:44:43.280 --> 03:44:45.181
LIAM: Yeah, he's either behind us or down below.

03:44:45.181 --> 03:44:52.456
MARISHA: Or he's not here at all and he's at the
bar that he likes to hang out at--

03:44:52.456 --> 03:44:53.485
SAM: The Trench.

03:44:53.485 --> 03:44:56.573
MARISHA: Called The Trench. Fuck you. So close, I
was almost there.

03:44:56.573 --> 03:44:58.482
SUMALEE: What about prisoners?

03:44:58.482 --> 03:45:04.510
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> there were some people in cages, but I
did not get a good look at them through my

03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:06.230
spider's eyes.

03:45:06.230 --> 03:45:16.227
SAM: We can't close this door that Nila just
exploded, but we can put up some sort of person to

03:45:16.227 --> 03:45:23.684
watch so some of us can go down there and snoop
around and maybe kill that one guard that you spotted.

03:45:23.684 --> 03:45:30.178
LIAM: Here is what I think: We have a bit of a
bottleneck here at this trapdoor. If they want to

03:45:30.178 --> 03:45:32.602
come up they have to deal with us, <i>ja?</i>

03:45:32.602 --> 03:45:33.608
SAM: Yes.

03:45:33.608 --> 03:45:40.867
LIAM: So if the majority of us wait at this trap
door and I send my spider upstairs to see what's

03:45:40.867 --> 03:45:49.784
going on, to see if our friend is up there, we can
learn about upstairs, and if anyone pokes their

03:45:49.784 --> 03:45:53.264
head out of that door they're going to lose it.

03:45:53.264 --> 03:45:55.286
ASHLY: That seems like a good plan to me.

03:45:55.286 --> 03:45:56.962
LIAM: Let's keep figuring things out.

03:45:56.962 --> 03:45:58.283
SAM: Okay.

03:45:58.283 --> 03:46:01.859
MATT: All right. So are you sending Frumpkin
upstairs?

03:46:01.859 --> 03:46:03.013
LIAM: Yeah.

03:46:03.013 --> 03:46:05.160
SAM: Any ideas, Mr. Clay?

03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:12.648
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, could just ask him to open
the door. The ruckus has stopped and obviously,

03:46:12.648 --> 03:46:14.499
somebody won this fight.

03:46:14.556 --> 03:46:16.063
MARISHA: We have the trapdoor open though,
right?

03:46:16.063 --> 03:46:17.134
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:46:17.134 --> 03:46:18.851
SAM: But the gate down there?

03:46:18.851 --> 03:46:20.114
TALIESIN: I can do that if you like.

03:46:20.114 --> 03:46:23.653
MARISHA: How about, everyone get ready?

03:46:23.653 --> 03:46:28.037
LIAM: Close it quietly, and if anyone has a look
around--

03:46:28.037 --> 03:46:34.382
TALIESIN: I can just go down and ask. I was going
to mention, I do look like a guard right now.

03:46:34.382 --> 03:46:39.051
MARISHA: You do. So do I. We still look like
guards.

03:46:39.051 --> 03:46:46.111
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing a little muck, putting it
on my face, getting all-- I could just go down if you like.

03:46:46.175 --> 03:46:48.613
MARISHA: Why don't we bring this guard up here to
us?

03:46:48.613 --> 03:46:52.347
LIAM: Wait, it's true, you look like one of the
guys upstairs, you could go down and tell them.

03:46:52.347 --> 03:47:00.090
But, well, you are putting a lot on the line for
people you've just met tonight.

03:47:00.090 --> 03:47:01.351
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's okay.

03:47:01.351 --> 03:47:02.202
LIAM: Yeah?

03:47:02.202 --> 03:47:03.245
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:47:03.245 --> 03:47:10.897
MARISHA: Why don't we handle this guard first, and
I go, here, lift up the gate. Lift up the trapdoor.

03:47:10.897 --> 03:47:12.933
TALIESIN: I'm going to go down.

03:47:12.933 --> 03:47:14.361
MARISHA: You're going down?

03:47:14.361 --> 03:47:15.289
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:47:15.289 --> 03:47:17.098
MARISHA: You don't want to bring him up? Okay.

03:47:17.098 --> 03:47:22.756
MATT: So you go ahead and descend the stairs into
this chamber.

03:47:22.813 --> 03:47:30.537
LIAM: Simultaneously, Caleb will slap his hand
down on Keg's shoulder and send Frumpkin on the

03:47:30.584 --> 03:47:36.760
ceiling or on the first floor, towards the
stairwell at the front of the building.

03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:38.041
MATT: Okay.

03:47:38.041 --> 03:47:44.705
MARISHA: I'm going to go down with Clay, but just
at the stairs, since I also look like a guard.

03:47:44.705 --> 03:47:47.796
MATT: Okay. So you stay at the stairs there,
Beau.

03:47:47.796 --> 03:47:48.865
MARISHA: Yep.

03:47:48.865 --> 03:47:54.571
MATT: All right. As you glance through, Clay, you
can see the faint light in here, you can see the

03:47:54.571 --> 03:47:57.432
figure's walking up to the cage, eyes still
trained on the door.

03:47:57.432 --> 03:48:05.597
TALIESIN: I'm just tapping on the doors. All
clear. We got one, it's Keg. We'll handle it. I'm

03:48:05.597 --> 03:48:06.864
going to head back upstairs.

03:48:06.864 --> 03:48:07.903
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:48:07.903 --> 03:48:08.802
TALIESIN: All right.

03:48:08.802 --> 03:48:10.102
MARISHA: Does he have advantage?

03:48:10.102 --> 03:48:14.701
MATT: No. It's allowing him to do one--

03:48:14.701 --> 03:48:15.944
TALIESIN: That's cocked.

03:48:15.944 --> 03:48:16.931
SAM: That was cocked.

03:48:16.931 --> 03:48:17.994
MATT: I saw it.

03:48:17.994 --> 03:48:20.477
TALIESIN: 18.

03:48:20.477 --> 03:48:22.239
MATT: 18?

03:48:22.239 --> 03:48:26.228
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading back up.

03:48:26.228 --> 03:48:28.990
MATT: "All right, I'll get back to work."

03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:31.242
TALIESIN: We could use your help up here if you
got a second.

03:48:31.242 --> 03:48:36.341
MATT: "I'm going to finish up." As you turn around
and begin to ascend the stairs, you begin to hear

03:48:36.341 --> 03:48:41.139
what sounds like a child beginning to scream.
(screams)

03:48:41.139 --> 03:48:53.349
MARISHA: I tap on the bars with my staff, and I
go: Wait man, Phil, there's something wrong with

03:48:53.408 --> 03:48:57.878
Phil, I think he really needs our help. Fucking
Phil, am I right?

03:48:57.878 --> 03:49:00.583
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:49:00.583 --> 03:49:03.896
LIAM: Roll fucking high, Marisha.

03:49:03.896 --> 03:49:07.262
MARISHA: I'm not gambling for torturing children.

03:49:07.262 --> 03:49:08.175
LIAM: Oh my god.

03:49:08.175 --> 03:49:10.669
(cheering)

03:49:10.669 --> 03:49:12.081
MARISHA: 21!

03:49:12.081 --> 03:49:13.966
SAM: Fucking Phil.

03:49:13.966 --> 03:49:16.691
LIAM: Phil, am I right?

03:49:16.691 --> 03:49:25.046
MATT: He pulls back. You can see there's a heated
spike that's orange at the tip that he pulls out

03:49:25.046 --> 03:49:28.663
of the cage. He goes (growling).

03:49:28.663 --> 03:49:30.450
TALIESIN: I'm going to head upstairs.

03:49:30.450 --> 03:49:33.231
MARISHA: I hate it when Phil ruins torturing
hour.

03:49:33.231 --> 03:49:39.575
MATT: He steps back towards the table at the back
and sets it down there, where you can see there are

03:49:39.657 --> 03:49:47.601
other implements laid out. He comes back to the
cage and goes, "I'll be back later," and comes to

03:49:47.601 --> 03:49:49.212
the door where you are.

03:49:49.212 --> 03:49:50.843
MARISHA: I step to the side, let him unlock the
door.

03:49:50.843 --> 03:49:52.360
TALIESIN: I'm heading up.

03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:55.140
MATT: Opens the door.

03:49:55.140 --> 03:49:59.128
TALIESIN: As I head up through the trapdoor, I'm
like, get ready everyone, just when he comes up,

03:49:59.128 --> 03:50:01.320
and just walking a little way past.

03:50:01.320 --> 03:50:05.778
MARISHA: I go: Just follow him.

03:50:05.778 --> 03:50:11.835
MATT: Steps up the stairs, makes it up through the
hatch.

03:50:11.835 --> 03:50:15.500
SAM: Everybody--

03:50:15.500 --> 03:50:16.840
MARISHA: Go!

03:50:16.840 --> 03:50:21.006
MATT: Everybody, make an ambush round. He was not
expecting that.

03:50:21.006 --> 03:50:24.109
LIAM: Caleb is not here; he is in the spider.

03:50:24.109 --> 03:50:29.805
MARISHA: First, you celebrate.

03:50:29.805 --> 03:50:33.709
MATT: Oh, shit. Is this on your Shillelagh? What
are you doing with this?

03:50:33.709 --> 03:50:34.541
SUMALEE: Yeah!

03:50:34.541 --> 03:50:35.681
MATT: Okay.

03:50:35.681 --> 03:50:36.658
ASHLY: 19.

03:50:36.658 --> 03:50:38.269
SAM: 15.

03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:39.317
LIAM: Spidering.

03:50:39.317 --> 03:50:43.853
TALIESIN: Never done this before. 17 plus
something.

03:50:43.853 --> 03:50:45.692
MATT: Yeah, you all hit. What are you doing?

03:50:45.692 --> 03:50:48.986
MARISHA: Oh, I don't think I hit.

03:50:48.986 --> 03:50:50.008
MATT: Nah.

03:50:50.008 --> 03:50:50.906
MARISHA: 12.

03:50:50.906 --> 03:50:52.212
MATT: All right, roll your d8.

03:50:52.212 --> 03:50:54.293
SUMALEE: d8 is--

03:50:54.293 --> 03:50:55.542
MATT: Eight-sided.

03:50:55.542 --> 03:50:58.163
SUMALEE: Six.

03:50:58.163 --> 03:51:04.023
MATT: That's 12 plus four, 16 points of damage.
Whack! Upside the head as he dizzies off from that

03:51:04.023 --> 03:51:06.516
point, immediately going into Keg. Roll damage on
that one.

03:51:06.516 --> 03:51:07.422
ASHLY: Six.

03:51:07.422 --> 03:51:10.488
MATT: Six damage, and carved from the battle axe.

03:51:10.488 --> 03:51:15.639
TALIESIN: Is it just a straight 1d6 plus nothing?

03:51:15.639 --> 03:51:17.097
MATT: What are you using?

03:51:17.097 --> 03:51:18.466
TALIESIN: I was using the staff.

03:51:18.466 --> 03:51:19.981
MATT: It's a 1d8.

03:51:19.981 --> 03:51:21.086
TALIESIN: Oh, it's 1d8.

03:51:21.086 --> 03:51:22.417
MATT: Yeah, because it's a quarterstaff.

03:51:22.417 --> 03:51:23.736
TALIESIN: Eight.

03:51:23.736 --> 03:51:25.452
MATT: Plus your strength modifier?

03:51:25.452 --> 03:51:30.073
TALIESIN: Seven, because I have my strength
modifier-- no, eight, just because I have no

03:51:30.073 --> 03:51:31.157
strength modifier.

03:51:31.157 --> 03:51:32.433
MATT: Crack! And then--

03:51:32.433 --> 03:51:34.708
SAM: Is this a surprise?

03:51:34.708 --> 03:51:36.375
MATT: It's a sneak attack, yeah.

03:51:36.375 --> 03:51:37.923
(gasping)

03:51:37.923 --> 03:51:44.704
SAM: Seven plus six, 13, plus-- I've been adding
wrong. 18.

03:51:44.704 --> 03:51:50.755
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it. He comes up and
immediately-- and falls to the ground, barely

03:51:50.755 --> 03:51:56.478
conscious, looking up, his face bloodied and the
crossbow bolt jammed into his shoulder and past

03:51:56.478 --> 03:51:59.315
the rib and he's having a hard time breathing.

03:51:59.315 --> 03:52:02.183
TALIESIN: Oh, no. Just going to turn him into
mulch. That's okay.

03:52:02.183 --> 03:52:05.621
(laughter)

03:52:05.621 --> 03:52:12.526
MATT: You watch as Clay, hushing as he just slowly
pushes his face in with his fist repeatedly.

03:52:12.526 --> 03:52:17.749
TALIESIN: I'm going to drag him back. We got another
suit, if anyone wants one.

03:52:17.749 --> 03:52:21.018
ASHLY: Well Nila, you can disguise yourself,
right?

03:52:21.018 --> 03:52:22.027
NILA: Yes.

03:52:22.027 --> 03:52:23.349
ASHLY: We could have two guards.

03:52:23.349 --> 03:52:25.426
MATT: Caleb, what are you doing?

03:52:25.426 --> 03:52:35.425
LIAM: Frumpkin is still climbing towards the
stairwell up and I am computing everything that

03:52:35.425 --> 03:52:42.748
our druid friend told me about the stairs to see
if Big Man is asleep in his room.

03:52:42.748 --> 03:52:44.943
MATT: So you coast around here--

03:52:44.943 --> 03:52:46.287
SAM: All the maps!

03:52:46.287 --> 03:52:51.353
TALIESIN and LIAM: (singing) So many maps!

03:52:51.353 --> 03:53:00.404
MATT: Make your way through, down this hall, to
the bedroom where you had seen was Lorenzo's room,

03:53:00.463 --> 03:53:09.988
not present. Crawls over to the next bedroom, two
beds. Not present.

03:53:09.988 --> 03:53:12.351
LIAM: I tell you what I'm going to do.

03:53:12.351 --> 03:53:14.407
MARISHA: This fucker's not here.

03:53:14.407 --> 03:53:23.198
LIAM: I'm at the top of these stairs. Boy, it's
hard to say because the map is gone, but I think

03:53:23.198 --> 03:53:31.936
what I will do is I'll drop out of Frumpkin for a
moment and I have 30 feet of movement, so I will

03:53:31.936 --> 03:53:35.784
walk 25 feet towards those stairs.

03:53:35.784 --> 03:53:37.689
MATT: Toward the stairs where Frumpkin was?

03:53:37.689 --> 03:53:38.480
LIAM: Yeah.

03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:39.244
MATT: Okay.

03:53:39.244 --> 03:53:40.532
LIAM: Yeah, towards the second floor.

03:53:40.532 --> 03:53:44.602
MATT: All right. You're at the base, essentially,
or near the staircase that leads up and out to

03:53:44.602 --> 03:53:46.069
this space there.

03:53:46.069 --> 03:53:56.991
LIAM: Oh wow. If I'm able, I will stand on my own
and go back into Frumpkin and wait because he is

03:53:57.041 --> 03:54:02.608
far ahead of me, Frumpkin, and my friends are
mostly behind me, but I'm okay.

03:54:02.608 --> 03:54:04.174
MATT: All right. What's everybody else doing?

03:54:04.174 --> 03:54:08.023
SAM: The gate's open.

03:54:08.023 --> 03:54:09.199
SUMALEE: I want to go down.

03:54:09.199 --> 03:54:12.367
ASHLY: I feel like I want to stay with Caleb, in
case.

03:54:12.367 --> 03:54:14.527
MATT: Okay, so Keg is staying up with Caleb.

03:54:14.527 --> 03:54:16.426
ASHLY: Is that cool with you, Caleb?

03:54:16.426 --> 03:54:17.745
SAM: I'll go with you, Nila.

03:54:17.745 --> 03:54:18.919
LIAM: I can't hear anything.

03:54:18.919 --> 03:54:20.710
MATT: Nila, you head down.

03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:22.530
ASHLY: Well, I'm going to stand behind you, in
case.

03:54:22.530 --> 03:54:23.777
LIAM: Oh, that's great.

03:54:23.777 --> 03:54:26.441
SUMALEE: Come join us.

03:54:26.441 --> 03:54:29.097
TALIESIN: I'll come down with you, that's fine.

03:54:29.097 --> 03:54:30.438
LIAM: Do I feel you next to me?

03:54:30.438 --> 03:54:31.662
ASHLY: Yeah, maybe I'll put my hand on you?

03:54:31.662 --> 03:54:43.786
LIAM: Do I? If I feel the dwarf next to me, I
would use a free hand to jam some licorice back

03:54:43.786 --> 03:54:51.791
into my mouth and start chewing furiously,
anxiously. I'm so scared of everything. And cast

03:54:51.791 --> 03:54:55.246
Haste again, into the dwarf.

03:54:55.246 --> 03:54:56.383
ASHLY: Tight.

03:54:56.383 --> 03:54:59.243
MATT: Okay, so you have one minute before that
spell goes away.

03:54:59.243 --> 03:55:05.533
LIAM: One minute, <i>ja</i>. I know. You are again on
methamphetamines.

03:55:05.533 --> 03:55:06.795
ASHLY: Perfect.

03:55:06.795 --> 03:55:13.952
MATT: Okay. As you enter this lower chamber, you
come in with a fair light. You look over on the

03:55:13.952 --> 03:55:24.028
table and there are the implements there. You step
out and there is a moment where you touch your

03:55:24.028 --> 03:55:32.320
foot to the ground, and something gives way. You
see a cable that was run through the ground

03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:39.874
quickly whip up the air, and you glance up to see
heavy netting that contains a bunch of broken

03:55:39.874 --> 03:55:46.345
brick and stone that falls down from the center of
the chamber. I need both Nott and Nila to make

03:55:46.345 --> 03:55:47.911
dexterity saving throws, please.

03:55:47.911 --> 03:55:55.000
SAM: We're not still under the influence of any
sort of thing?

03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:57.001
MATT: It only lasts a-- nice.

03:55:57.001 --> 03:55:58.052
SUMALEE: 21.

03:55:58.052 --> 03:55:58.953
SAM: 11.

03:55:58.953 --> 03:56:04.598
MATT: 11. That's a failure on your point. That is
eight points of bludgeoning damage to you, four

03:56:04.598 --> 03:56:11.031
points to you, as this pile of stone fills the
corner. You guys manage to step off to the side

03:56:11.031 --> 03:56:19.225
and pull yourself out of the rubble, but you get
the sense now that this room is definitely trapped

03:56:19.225 --> 03:56:24.991
and there is definitely an awareness within and
deeper of your presence. Nila, as you recover from

03:56:24.991 --> 03:56:31.076
this, you glance up and see the cage in the corner
that you had passed when you first entered and you

03:56:31.076 --> 03:56:41.290
see a hand hanging off one of the metal bars-- a
tiny, familiar hand: a bit of fur that covers

03:56:41.290 --> 03:56:46.924
and vanishing into the faint, grayish-blue tint of
what is Asar's hand.

03:56:46.924 --> 03:57:00.646
SUMALEE: I want to go to him, to touch him-- but I
want to make sure that there's nothing that is

03:57:00.646 --> 03:57:03.278
going to trigger something else.

03:57:03.278 --> 03:57:04.806
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:57:04.806 --> 03:57:11.391
SUMALEE: Oh! I'm so nervous! 19?

03:57:11.391 --> 03:57:12.619
MATT and MARISHA: That's cocked.

03:57:12.619 --> 03:57:13.665
SUMALEE: (groans)

03:57:13.665 --> 03:57:15.540
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry. It was almost good.

03:57:15.540 --> 03:57:16.840
SUMALEE: Eight.

03:57:16.840 --> 03:57:17.662
MATT: Plus?

03:57:17.662 --> 03:57:19.193
SUMALEE: Plus my, which check?

03:57:19.193 --> 03:57:20.147
MATT: Investigation.

03:57:20.147 --> 03:57:27.115
SUMALEE: Nine-- oh, no, minus one. Seven, shit.
Should I use my luck point now?

03:57:27.115 --> 03:57:29.237
LIAM: No, your luck is dead.

03:57:29.237 --> 03:57:31.008
MATT: No, she didn't use it last time, she saved
it--

03:57:31.008 --> 03:57:32.589
LIAM: Oh, you saved it! (inhales)

03:57:32.589 --> 03:57:33.871
SUMALEE: I have to.

03:57:33.871 --> 03:57:35.173
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:57:35.173 --> 03:57:39.446
(groans)

03:57:39.446 --> 03:57:43.186
LIAM: Oh, no! It's a one!

03:57:43.186 --> 03:57:44.949
SAM: Kid's dead, let's go home.

03:57:44.949 --> 03:57:48.201
MATT: Well, you still pick the one you want to, so
you go with the previous one. You don't have to pick

03:57:48.201 --> 03:57:51.179
the one. Pretty sure that's how the luck feat
works, right?

03:57:51.179 --> 03:57:53.298
LIAM: That's right. Whatever one you want.

03:57:53.298 --> 03:58:02.313
MATT: From best you can tell, there is nothing; no
contraption adhered to the cage. It's just a cage.

03:58:02.313 --> 03:58:10.640
You come up close and look inside. You can see
Kitor, your partner, is slumped in the back of the

03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:14.766
cage, unconscious. With what little bit of light is
in here as you focus-- you have darkvision, so you

03:58:14.766 --> 03:58:22.871
can see in his unconscious face he is still
breathing, but there are wounds and scrapes. You

03:58:22.871 --> 03:58:30.077
look and see Asar, who is awake, who is currently
holding a burn puncture right in his abdomen. He

03:58:30.077 --> 03:58:40.069
looks up to you, the sweat dripping down his face,
and goes, "Mama? Mama!" and leans up to the cage

03:58:40.069 --> 03:58:43.809
and puts his hand over the outside of the bar and
reaches out for you with the other hand and

03:58:43.809 --> 03:58:52.976
entwines his fingers. "Mama, you came."

03:58:52.976 --> 03:59:05.976
SUMALEE: I'm here. Mama's here. I want to heal
them. Can I heal them?

03:59:05.976 --> 03:59:07.726
MATT: If you have a heal spell, yeah.

03:59:07.726 --> 03:59:11.441
SUMALEE: I have Healing Word.

03:59:11.441 --> 03:59:13.317
MATT: Yeah.

03:59:13.317 --> 03:59:15.786
LIAM: (quietly) I don't like it.

03:59:15.786 --> 03:59:18.833
MATT: What's your healing word to your son?

03:59:18.833 --> 03:59:24.539
SUMALEE: (quickly reading under breath)

03:59:24.539 --> 03:59:26.385
MATT: What's the word you say that heals him?

03:59:26.385 --> 03:59:27.999
SUMALEE: Oh, what's the word I say, I'm sorry.

03:59:27.999 --> 03:59:29.364
MATT: What phrase? It's up to you.

03:59:29.364 --> 03:59:38.740
SUMALEE: Be well. Be well, my son.

03:59:38.794 --> 03:59:42.414
MATT: Roll a d4.

03:59:42.414 --> 03:59:48.803
MARISHA: That's pretty good. It's three.

03:59:48.803 --> 03:59:50.376
SUMALEE: Three? Did that count?

03:59:50.376 --> 03:59:52.082
MATT: Sure, I'll let it. It's all right.

03:59:52.082 --> 03:59:53.621
MARISHA: Plus your wisdom modifier.

03:59:53.621 --> 04:00:04.801
MATT: I think it's a plus four? Yeah, okay.
Looking really hurt from whatever injuries he's

04:00:04.801 --> 04:00:09.856
sustained, you watch as the injuries slowly close
up and he breathes a little heartier again and

04:00:09.856 --> 04:00:17.082
looks at you with a renewed smile, his hand still
entwining your fingers, and says, "Mama, I want to

04:00:17.082 --> 04:00:18.690
"go home."

04:00:18.690 --> 04:00:32.215
SUMALEE: I'll bring you home. We're going to get
you out of here. I grab that cage and try to pull

04:00:32.215 --> 04:00:34.063
it apart as much as I can.

04:00:34.063 --> 04:00:35.245
SAM: Let me try to unlock it.

04:00:35.245 --> 04:00:36.733
(laughing)

04:00:36.733 --> 04:00:40.637
MATT: Well, make a strength check, just for the
hell of it. Because life gets weird.

04:00:40.637 --> 04:00:43.183
MARISHA: While this is happening, can I come and
watch this corridor?

04:00:43.183 --> 04:00:44.947
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to come in the corridor
as well.

04:00:44.947 --> 04:00:48.115
MARISHA: I'm going to suck up against this wall
and look to make sure no one is coming around that

04:00:48.115 --> 04:00:50.332
hall while this is happening.

04:00:50.332 --> 04:00:54.268
TALIESIN: Since I still look like a soldier, I'm
going to be willing to be a little visible on the corner.

04:00:54.642 --> 04:00:58.850
MARISHA: Yeah, actually, we both look like
soldiers. We block this corridor, looking like soldiers.

04:00:58.850 --> 04:01:00.313
MATT: Okay, you move into the corridor?

04:01:00.313 --> 04:01:03.225
MARISHA: Just backs to that corridor in this
room.

04:01:03.225 --> 04:01:04.096
MATT: Like this?

04:01:04.096 --> 04:01:07.428
MARISHA: Yup, like we're watching-- guarding this
room together.

04:01:08.698 --> 04:01:13.728
SUMALEE: Strength check, 19 plus two.

04:01:13.728 --> 04:01:14.557
SAM: Wow.

04:01:14.557 --> 04:01:21.729
MATT: You begin to (strains)-- and you watch as
Nila's arms pop with the muscles filling with

04:01:21.729 --> 04:01:30.178
adrenaline and emotion as the metal bars bend ever
so slightly. Just enough to maybe fit Asar

04:01:30.178 --> 04:01:37.803
through-- not your mate. You pull them just enough
and you reach through and he pulls his way, and

04:01:37.803 --> 04:01:42.501
you help him grab his shoulder, and slowly you
pull your son free from the cage and into your arms.

04:01:44.481 --> 04:01:54.717
SUMALEE: (sobs) I hug him again. I want to go, I
want to run. I don't know what to do. I look

04:01:54.717 --> 04:02:00.136
inside and see if there's any way that I can pull
further to get Kitor out too.

04:02:00.136 --> 04:02:06.014
MATT: The bars have gone as far as they can go,
and you continue to pull, the emotion in there.

04:02:06.014 --> 04:02:12.875
Your strength is waning from the physical exertion
of getting even that bit of the metal open.

04:02:12.875 --> 04:02:19.557
SUMALEE: Can I heal him? I know he has powers to
help himself out of here if I heal him.

04:02:19.557 --> 04:02:21.935
MATT: You can try, yeah.

04:02:21.935 --> 04:02:25.914
SAM: While she does that, I'll try to jimmy the
bent lock.

04:02:25.914 --> 04:02:27.215
MATT: Go for it.

04:02:28.375 --> 04:02:30.275
SAM: Yeah, that's a one.

04:02:30.275 --> 04:02:32.005
(laughing)

04:02:32.005 --> 04:02:33.623
MATT: Sam!

04:02:33.623 --> 04:02:35.650
MARISHA: You're supposed to be good at this!

04:02:35.650 --> 04:02:37.444
MATT: Buddy...

04:02:37.444 --> 04:02:40.151
SAM: You ruined the fucking lock!

04:02:40.151 --> 04:02:42.187
(laughter)

04:02:42.187 --> 04:02:43.056
SAM: You bent it!

04:02:43.056 --> 04:02:46.375
SUMALEE: You can't blame the mother!

04:02:46.375 --> 04:02:47.795
MATT: Roll for Healing Word.

04:02:47.795 --> 04:02:50.741
TALIESIN: Just for my own giggles, I'm going to
cast Detect Magic really quickly, because this

04:02:50.741 --> 04:02:52.532
place is giving me the creeps.

04:02:52.532 --> 04:02:53.454
MATT: Okay.

04:02:53.454 --> 04:02:57.911
TALIESIN: I have an auto-thing I can do
apparently, which is nuts.

04:02:57.911 --> 04:03:02.516
MATT: I'm going to need a new iPad. This thing is
crashing and falling apart the whole night. Great job.

04:03:02.516 --> 04:03:05.640
SAM: I'm going to look around for keys or
something. Just around the room.

04:03:05.640 --> 04:03:07.897
MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

04:03:07.897 --> 04:03:09.150
SAM: That's a one.

04:03:09.150 --> 04:03:11.998
ASHLY: Oh my god. You need to use a new one.

04:03:11.998 --> 04:03:13.723
MARISHA: Did you just roll two ones in a row?

04:03:13.723 --> 04:03:18.058
MATT: Sam, we're not making money for charity. You
can slow your roll here, buddy.

04:03:18.058 --> 04:03:19.957
SAM: 826LA, guys!

04:03:22.187 --> 04:03:23.457
SUMALEE: Do I roll this for--?

04:03:23.457 --> 04:03:24.560
MATT: Yeah, to heal.

04:03:24.560 --> 04:03:30.874
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic as a
racial trait, which apparently is a thing you can do.

04:03:30.874 --> 04:03:31.557
SAM: Wow.

04:03:31.557 --> 04:03:33.119
TALIESIN: Firbolgs are amazing.

04:03:33.119 --> 04:03:35.366
SAM: Any magic?

04:03:35.366 --> 04:03:39.075
MATT: In the immediate chamber?

04:03:39.075 --> 04:03:39.988
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:03:39.988 --> 04:03:47.766
MATT: Focusing on this, you don't sense any
immediate magical auras within the chamber.

04:03:47.766 --> 04:03:53.668
TALIESIN: All right. How about within 30 feet. Am
I getting a ping?

04:03:53.668 --> 04:03:56.760
MATT: Nothing that you can see in the immediate
area, no.

04:03:56.760 --> 04:03:59.798
SUMALEE: Five.

04:03:59.798 --> 04:04:07.893
MATT: You watch as Kitor (rouses). One eye is
swollen shut, the other opens a bit, and you watch

04:04:07.893 --> 04:04:13.795
as the swelling slowly goes away from that eye.
It's still purple from the outside, but the

04:04:13.795 --> 04:04:22.038
swelling has diminished from the healing effect of
your spell, and he looks up. "My mate." He looks

04:04:22.038 --> 04:04:27.553
down at his hands and looks out and sees that
Asar's been freed, and he looks out at the strange

04:04:27.553 --> 04:04:31.096
crew-- looks towards both of you and (gasps).

04:04:31.096 --> 04:04:38.494
SUMALEE: It's okay, they're safe. They came to
help. Can you get out?

04:04:38.494 --> 04:04:40.154
MATT: "Help me."

04:04:40.154 --> 04:04:41.905
SUMALEE: How? Tell me.

04:04:41.905 --> 04:04:47.891
MATT: He stands up in the cage; his hunched form
is crammed in by this cage that was not designed

04:04:47.891 --> 04:04:54.983
for his firbolg body. Nevertheless, he reaches out
and grabs the bars where you had started. "On

04:04:54.983 --> 04:05:02.455
"three: one, two, three-- (strains)." He's going to
go ahead and make a strength check with advantage.

04:05:02.455 --> 04:05:07.316
That's a natural 17... and a natural 19! I love it
when it works for the narrative!

04:05:07.316 --> 04:05:09.639
(laughing)

04:05:09.639 --> 04:05:14.679
MATT: That puts it over 20. Both of you together
(strains), and one of the bars comes off on one

04:05:14.679 --> 04:05:20.961
side. He gets in quickly and puts his shoulder in
and pushes against the other, and that bends off

04:05:20.961 --> 04:05:26.264
to the side, leaving just enough room for him to
push through. It takes a minute and you're helping

04:05:26.264 --> 04:05:30.902
him and grabbing his elbow, and the two of your
together-- You feel something pop in his shoulder,

04:05:30.902 --> 04:05:41.542
but it's just enough to get his body to wedge out
of the space, and he comes back out of it and

04:05:41.542 --> 04:05:50.792
embraces you-- the other arm limply hanging at one
side, but he takes you in his hand. He looks down

04:05:50.792 --> 04:06:01.277
at his son and looks over at the rest of you,
tired. Still, amongst the trauma he has suffered,

04:06:01.277 --> 04:06:13.488
there is a pride and a silent strength to him--
very much similar to that you've seen in Nila. "I

04:06:13.488 --> 04:06:19.178
do not know by what grace you've come to us, but
thank you."

04:06:22.688 --> 04:06:28.518
MARISHA: Well, we relied on your mate here.
Couldn't have done it without her.

04:06:31.428 --> 04:06:33.551
SAM: Yeah, she's quite impressive.

04:06:33.551 --> 04:06:37.030
MATT: "That she is," and pets the back of your
head.

04:06:38.690 --> 04:06:43.476
MARISHA: Now, if I was you, I'd run.

04:06:43.476 --> 04:06:46.104
SUMALEE: What about your friends?

04:06:50.854 --> 04:06:59.619
MARISHA: You have a child with you. You need to
get him out of here. He's suffered enough. We've

04:06:59.619 --> 04:07:00.877
got it from here.

04:07:02.037 --> 04:07:03.551
SUMALEE: Thank you.

04:07:03.551 --> 04:07:06.006
MARISHA: We wouldn't have gotten this far without
you.

04:07:07.806 --> 04:07:08.692
SUMALEE: Clay?

04:07:08.692 --> 04:07:09.483
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:07:11.053 --> 04:07:17.368
SUMALEE: We'll go back to your temple. Will you
help these people-- will you help these friends?

04:07:17.368 --> 04:07:23.150
TALIESIN: Yeah, I like what's happening here.
Here, come on. Give me a hug.

04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:25.987
SUMALEE: Nila gives him a big hug.

04:07:25.987 --> 04:07:29.687
TALIESIN: Some tea for the road. I've got a bit of
it left.

04:07:29.687 --> 04:07:31.961
(laughing)

04:07:31.961 --> 04:07:33.357
SAM: Is it already steeped, or is that just the--

04:07:33.357 --> 04:07:35.002
TALIESIN: No, it's just loose leaf.

04:07:35.002 --> 04:07:35.804
SAM: Oh, okay.

04:07:35.804 --> 04:07:37.180
TALIESIN: It's not a bag. It's just loose leaf.

04:07:37.180 --> 04:07:45.144
MATT: Kitor picks up Asar and throws him over his
shoulder, now standing in his full form, just

04:07:45.144 --> 04:07:58.823
below the ceiling of this chamber-- taller, even,
than Clay. "Thank you. Let's go home."

04:07:58.823 --> 04:08:00.620
TALIESIN: See you soon.

04:08:00.620 --> 04:08:03.092
MARISHA: We'll see you later.

04:08:03.092 --> 04:08:13.244
SUMALEE: Oh, before I forget. Nila wears a
necklace of six red feathers. Four of these

04:08:13.244 --> 04:08:22.983
feathers were people from my tribe who were taken:
one for Kitor, one for Asar, one for Duma, and one

04:08:22.983 --> 04:08:35.903
for-- oh, shoot. So emotional, but I know it--
Duma and Masag. Masag was one of our strongest.

04:08:35.903 --> 04:08:45.567
They took him too, and Duma was the little one
that Jumnda mentioned. One feather was for me, for

04:08:45.567 --> 04:08:54.125
leaving my tribe to find my family, and I took an
extra one because I thought I would find friends

04:08:54.125 --> 04:09:04.931
who might help me. I will give it to you. I undo
the feather, pull it off; it's a perfectly intact

04:09:04.931 --> 04:09:14.516
red feather. I don't know who will take it, but if
you ever need our help, you can come to the

04:09:14.516 --> 04:09:23.144
temple. If, by chance, we're not there-- but only
because one of us would go back to check on the

04:09:23.342 --> 04:09:34.130
others of our tribe-- we'll be in the Crispvale
Thicket. Just go where the moss is the thickest,

04:09:34.130 --> 04:09:40.727
and I'll be there. Thank you for everything. Thank
you so much.

04:09:40.727 --> 04:09:50.444
MARISHA: We'll find you again, Nila.

04:09:50.444 --> 04:09:53.685
SUMALEE: Thank you. Let's go.

04:09:53.685 --> 04:09:56.312
MATT: "Good luck."

04:09:56.312 --> 04:09:57.443
SAM: Bye.

04:09:57.443 --> 04:10:07.057
MATT: You watch as the three of them, given a
second chance at life and freedom, step through

04:10:07.057 --> 04:10:15.520
the door where you entered and vanish up the
stairs, the heavy footfalls dissipating as they

04:10:15.520 --> 04:10:21.858
grow further and further from you. The two of you,
who have been focusing-- that point, the Haste

04:10:21.858 --> 04:10:32.322
spell having coursed into your body-- glance
behind and see as the family steps through the

04:10:32.322 --> 04:10:47.908
kitchen door and exits. There's only one path left
to find the others that were taken. And that's

04:10:47.908 --> 04:10:48.841
where we'll leave tonight's game.

04:10:48.841 --> 04:10:49.818
SAM: (groans)

04:10:49.818 --> 04:10:51.205
TALIESIN: This was the <i>best.</i>

04:10:51.205 --> 04:10:53.405
SUMALEE: Thank you guys so much!

04:10:53.405 --> 04:10:54.173
ASHLY: Sumalee!

04:10:54.173 --> 04:10:55.573
MARISHA: Sumalee!

04:10:55.573 --> 04:10:59.398
SUMALEE: You guys <i>rock!</i>

04:10:59.398 --> 04:11:02.155
MATT: Thank you for playing with us!

04:11:02.155 --> 04:11:03.721
SUMALEE: This was such an amazing experience.

04:11:03.721 --> 04:11:07.753
MARISHA: One red Nila feather.

04:11:07.753 --> 04:11:11.626
TALIESIN: (as "The Twelve Days of Christmas") Five
gold coins!

04:11:11.626 --> 04:11:15.691
LIAM: I have so much murder in my eye right now.

04:11:15.691 --> 04:11:20.266
TALIESIN: I love this color, by the way, that
we're getting right now. That's lovely.

04:11:20.266 --> 04:11:21.429
MATT: It's a fun one, yeah.

04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:22.285
ASHLY: That was beautiful.

04:11:22.285 --> 04:11:24.064
MARISHA: That was so amazing!

04:11:24.064 --> 04:11:25.227
SUMALEE: Thank you guys for having me!

04:11:25.227 --> 04:11:26.684
TALIESIN: You were so much fun!

04:11:26.684 --> 04:11:28.264
MATT: Thank you for coming. You were amazing.

04:11:28.264 --> 04:11:34.315
SUMALEE: Thank you guys. This has been
mindblowingly fun. It's so easy to get into with

04:11:34.315 --> 04:11:41.988
all of you guys being so-- embodying your
characters so well. It just is so easy.

04:11:41.988 --> 04:11:43.739
MATT: It's the best game. It's the best game!

04:11:43.739 --> 04:11:46.386
SUMALEE: I had so much fun. Oh my gosh.

04:11:46.386 --> 04:11:49.938
MARISHA: You were the softness that we needed--

04:11:49.938 --> 04:11:50.774
ASHLY: Desperately.

04:11:50.774 --> 04:11:52.303
MARISHA: --in our group. Desperately.

04:11:52.303 --> 04:11:54.095
LIAM: What do you mean?

04:11:54.095 --> 04:11:57.007
MATT: Everything fits so well into place.

04:11:57.007 --> 04:12:05.206
MARISHA: She was the Charmin bear, and we were
like... rocks? I don't know, that's all I got.

04:12:05.206 --> 04:12:09.440
LIAM: Things are really bad in the Mighty Nein
when Nott is the soft member of the group.

04:12:09.440 --> 04:12:10.482
MARISHA: That's true!

04:12:10.482 --> 04:12:16.465
MATT: Yeah. Aw, man, we get to pick up this next
phase at GenCon.

04:12:16.465 --> 04:12:18.717
SAM: We're going to be doing this live next time?

04:12:18.717 --> 04:12:19.845
MATT: Apparently, yeah.

04:12:19.845 --> 04:12:20.851
SAM: Holy moley.

04:12:20.851 --> 04:12:22.368
MATT: This is where we got to. Oh man.

04:12:22.368 --> 04:12:24.063
TALIESIN: Exciting!

04:12:24.063 --> 04:12:26.181
MATT: Oh, boy, that's going to be fun.

04:12:26.181 --> 04:12:30.252
LIAM: See player characters killed <i>live</i> in
Indianapolis!

04:12:30.252 --> 04:12:32.751
TALIESIN: Are you not entertained?!

04:12:32.751 --> 04:12:39.237
SUMALEE: Seriously, thank you for introducing me
to this game. I mean it.

04:12:39.237 --> 04:12:40.464
SAM: You were so great.

04:12:40.464 --> 04:12:46.873
SUMALEE: Now I understand why people that I know
play this game--

04:12:46.873 --> 04:12:53.457
LIAM: Sumalee. Sam and I were talking about
bullshit before the beginning of the game, and I

04:12:53.457 --> 04:12:58.401
forget the context but he was talking about you
and I said, "No, she's never played. She played

04:12:58.401 --> 04:13:04.020
"one practice game before this," and Sam's brain
went (explosion).

04:13:04.020 --> 04:13:08.519
SAM: You were so great, so confident, so much
great roleplaying. Amazing.

04:13:08.519 --> 04:13:17.182
SUMALEE: I learned from you guys. I learned by
watching you! Yeah, I played one... what do you

04:13:17.182 --> 04:13:20.799
call it, a one-off? It was a three hour one-off.

04:13:20.799 --> 04:13:21.628
SAM: With Matt?

04:13:21.628 --> 04:13:28.699
SUMALEE: No, a dear, dear friend of mine, Tom
Lommel, ran-- he pulled in some friends so I would

04:13:28.699 --> 04:13:35.200
have some sense, because I didn't want to-- he was
like, "Your first game is going to be on Critical

04:13:35.200 --> 04:13:39.688
"Role? You need to come over and we'll play one
practice round."

04:13:39.688 --> 04:13:45.429
MATT: No, you've been so great, thank you for
joining us, seriously. And for bringing a

04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:48.525
character that I think all of us are absolutely in
love with.

04:13:48.525 --> 04:13:51.799
SUMALEE: And now there's a firbolg! I feel like
leaving--

04:13:51.799 --> 04:13:52.968
SAM: Passing the torch.

04:13:52.968 --> 04:13:54.502
MARISHA: Passing the torch!

04:13:54.502 --> 04:14:00.954
MATT: Well. On that note, let's go ahead and close
tonight's game--

04:14:00.954 --> 04:14:02.637
SUMALEE: Oh, was all that-- that was all
recorded?

04:14:02.637 --> 04:14:03.117
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:14:03.117 --> 04:14:04.165
SUMALEE: Oh, we're still on?

04:14:04.165 --> 04:14:05.388
MATT: Yeah! No, we're still on.

04:14:05.388 --> 04:14:08.280
(laughter)

04:14:08.280 --> 04:14:09.391
SUMALEE: I thought we were done!

04:14:09.391 --> 04:14:10.385
MATT: No, we're still going!

04:14:10.385 --> 04:14:11.441
SAM: We're still on the TV.

04:14:11.441 --> 04:14:17.831
LIAM: No no no, we're not. They cut the stream.
Tell us about your politics.

04:14:17.831 --> 04:14:20.335
SUMALEE: I totally believed you. I was like "Oh,
wait, are we?"

04:14:20.335 --> 04:14:24.149
MATT: Aw. Thank you so much for joining us; you're
amazing. I've been wanting to have you on for a

04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:25.989
while, so I'm glad we could make it work.

04:14:25.989 --> 04:14:27.525
SUMALEE: Thank you so much.

04:14:27.525 --> 04:14:34.952
MATT: A pleasure. We pick up this live at GenCon
next <i>Friday,</i> at 6:00pm Pacific, 9:00pm Eastern.

04:14:34.952 --> 04:14:40.673
Super excited for that. Until then, guys, have a
wonderful week, we love you, and is it Thursday--

04:14:40.673 --> 04:14:44.364
or <i>Friday</i> yet? Good night!
