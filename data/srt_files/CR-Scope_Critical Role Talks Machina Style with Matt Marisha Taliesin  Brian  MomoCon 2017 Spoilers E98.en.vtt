NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:12.061
[dramatic music]

00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.260
BRIAN: To the lord of the underworld, Taliesin
Jaffe!

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.659
(cheering)

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:36.850
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah. Up next: steer clear of lava,
sharp drop-offs. She's the most fun in the world,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.274
Marisha Ray!

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:44.988
(cheering)

00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:50.860
BRIAN: And finally, the man whose brain spawned
all of this weirdness, Matthew Mercer!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.861
(cheering)

00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.449
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.798
MATT: Oh, hai. Adjusting our chairs the whole--

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:05.578
BRIAN: Yeah, we're going to be doing a lot of--

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:07.703
MARISHA: These are awkward chairs.

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:15.560
BRIAN: Get their money's worth. Well, we decided
that we're just going to do a Q&amp;A for the hour, so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.334
line up in an orderly fashion and--

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.458
MATT: Orderly. Calmly, respectfully.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.239
MARISHA: Lifeguard rules. No running, concrete is
slippery.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:31.410
BRIAN: A couple of guidelines really fast, if we
can, want to try to just do one question so we can

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.310
get through as many as possible. Then we're not
able to do selfies or anything like that because

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.999
of the rules.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.789
(laughter)

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.519
BRIAN: And the distance, the sheer distance. But
yeah, we're going to try to get through as many as

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:51.899
we can, so let's do it! Please tell us your name
before your question, too, so we can know who you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.350
are and put a name with that beautiful, beautiful
face.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289
ALEX: Hello? Is this on?

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.288
MATT: Oh! Can we get some audio on that mic, if
you don't mind?

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:05.099
BRIAN: Then we'll probably need that up here in
this speaker.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.459
TALIESIN: Just keep saying random things until it
makes noise.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.480
ALEX: Ooh, there we go. Hello.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.730
MARISHA: Little bit. Little bit more, little
bit louder.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.663
BRIAN: Can we get that in the weg so we can hear
the question?

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:19.089
MATT: Could you count down for us? Ten to one.

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.490
ALEX: Me? Okay.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.009
MATT: Okay, count down in the microphone for us.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.486
ALEX: Ten, nine, eight, seven--

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:29.020
MATT: We got it, all right, thank you.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.169
ALEX: Awesome, there we go! Hello, I'm Alex.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.358
MARISHA: Willing to walk the line for us, I love
it.

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:41.878
ALEX: Thank you. So my question is for the three
players and Matt. So when you're planning more

00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:46.318
story arcs and sort of character directions for
all the different characters, like the de Rolo arc

00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:51.088
that Percy had to go to, do you discuss that with
them beforehand to make sure it's okay with them

00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:54.640
as their player or do you surprise them with it?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.010
MATT: I mean, when the characters create their
backstories and such, I let themâ€“ they'll ask me

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.068
some semblance of the world and, you know,
locations and stuff, and I'll give them some

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:12.507
places they can pull from and they create from
there. Background elements, that's mainly their

00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:17.057
creation, and then I incorporate and tweak things
as it goes. But as far as things that are coming

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:22.028
up in the story, no, I want to surprise them as
the character would know. I mean, if it's

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:28.150
something that I feel needs to be a discussion, I
don't want to-- if I feel that it'll deter or

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.849
alter heavily a direction they want to go with the
character, then maybe I'll be like, "Hey, how do

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.966
"you feel about me tweaking with something that you
had already established?" But, generally, I want

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:45.151
the character to experience it with the player and
vice-versa. So that really came to fruition with

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:46.543
the Briarwood arc.

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:51.669
TALIESIN: Yeah, I gave you about a page--
everything on Whitestone and everything with Percy

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.869
fits on about a page of relatively small type. It
was nothing that he wouldn't have already known.

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:03.242
There was no information on that page that Percy
didn't know, like nothing he didn't witness

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:08.920
himself. He didn't know who the Briarwoods were,
he didn't know what was happening, he didn't know

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.224
even-- I left it pretty open whether or not the
dream was a real dream or a demon or a whatever,

00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:19.639
there was none of that information. At one point
I'm like, "I have a couple notes of things I want

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.640
"to add," and your response was, "Well, I would get
your shit together pretty quick." That was all I

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.169
was really given. I'm like, "Uh, okay. Why? Oh,
no!"

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.158
MATT: Yeah, the whole Orthax, the whole smoke
demon, that was not converted. It was just a dream

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:40.295
of some dark entity that inspired him, and
everything else extrapolated from there.

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:43.558
TALIESIN: It could have been just a dream. It
would've been-- that would've been interesting if

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:47.588
it had just been a dream and not really a thing
and it was just him being a terrible person.

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.034
That's great.

00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:50.980
ALEX: All right, thank you so much. Oh.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.328
BRIAN: Thanks, Alex.

00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:58.357
MATT: Good question. Which, by the way, just out
of curiosity, raise your hand if you've not seen

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:04.157
any Critical Role or have any idea what it is. I
am so excited for you. You're going to be so

00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:06.399
confused this entire panel, it's going to be
great.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.041
BRIAN: This is not about Scientology. Just to let
you guys know.

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:16.561
MATT: But so you're aware, Critical Role is a
Twitch stream where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.400
actors, present company included, play Dungeons
and Dragons once a week. So this is our D&amp;D game

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.528
where we roll dice and get really geeky.

00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:29.503
(cheering)

00:05:30.743 --> 00:05:34.670
MATT: Sponsored by the Red Bull in my stomach.
Hello, what's your name?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.480
QUINN: Hi, I'm Quinn, and bidet.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.369
ALL: Bidet.

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:45.969
QUINN: My question is: has there ever been a
moment where the players went completely off the rails?

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.947
TALIESIN: (yelling) Let's go on a pub crawl, woo!

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:52.349
MARISHA: I was about to say: every Thursday.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:06:02.669
MATT: Part of your role as a DM or GM is you're
trying to ascertain the probable direction they'll

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.528
take and prepare for that, and then try and
prepare for a couple of alternate scenarios.

00:06:07.528 --> 00:06:14.148
Sometimes they'll shoot close to one of those, and
you can tailor some ideas to make it work,

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:17.896
sometimes they end up going directly where you
thought they were going and you're like: yes! Then

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:22.707
sometimes they'll go a complete 180 and you're
having to fly by the seat of your pants. There are

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:27.566
a number of times that happened. Let's see.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:32.197
TALIESIN: Fire Plane was a big one, I remember.
You were almost irritated at the Fire Plane. You

00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:33.875
were borderline irritated.

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.627
MATT: Well, I wasn't irritated, I was like: all
right, this is where we're-- I'm never irritated

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:37.736
by it.

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:39.367
TALIESIN: We spent weeks telling you we weren't
going.

00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:43.518
MATT: Yeah. You were like, "Well, we're not going
there. We're not going there. We're going there."

00:06:43.518 --> 00:06:51.416
I'm like, oh okay, guess we're going there. The
whole intro sequence of them arriving at the City

00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:57.289
of Brass, the meeting of Senokir as an NPC. That
was all improvised. That whole sequence. I had

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.616
nothing prepared. Because I didn't think they were
going to go there. I had a semblance of some

00:07:01.616 --> 00:07:07.708
things they might encounter in that area, but I
hadn't fleshed it out fully yet. So yeah, it

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:10.368
happens. Often. More often than you'd think.

00:07:12.228 --> 00:07:14.058
BRIAN: Thank you. Hey, what's your name?

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:23.908
GILLIE: Hi! My name is Gillie. Welcome to MomoCon.
I have a question for our voice actors. Of all the

00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:29.409
characters you have voiced-- major, minor, side
characters-- is there any one of those you would

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:31.708
play in a campaign, and why?

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.768
MATT: Huh. That's an interesting thought.

00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:43.039
TALIESIN: My answer is cheap. I'm such a superhero
nerd and I'm such a Flash nerd and I would love to

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.766
do a superhero. I used to play Champions. I built
speedsters in Champions all the time. I loved

00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:50.355
playing speedsters.

00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:58.255
MARISHA: Margaret from Persona would be cool,
because she uses the tarot cards and is pretty

00:07:58.255 --> 00:08:03.019
badass and powerful. Yeah, she'd be awesome. She
can fly.

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:09.873
MATT: I'd say probably Kiritsugu Emiya from
Fate/Zero. Because he's a combination of a really

00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:17.190
awesome and powerful rifleman and assassin-type
character, but has some powerful self-altering

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:23.820
magics and just has an interesting disposition and
moral quandary about his character, so he'd be a

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.348
fun one to roleplay, definitely.

00:08:25.348 --> 00:08:26.498
GILLIE: Thank you so much!

00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:28.429
PANEL: Thank you! It was a great question.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:34.707
WILLIAM: Hey, guys. It's William, it's been a
while since I've seen you.

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:36.348
MATT: Good to see you, man.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:44.329
WILLIAM: Start off with a fun question from the
last episode. There were a lot of people in chat

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:51.659
debating how that fight was going to go, and who
was going to come out on top. Going into it, who

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:56.730
did you guys think was going to win, and what were
some abilities or items that you were thinking

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.627
might come up that didn't?

00:08:58.627 --> 00:09:02.588
MATT: Okay, and let's preface this because some
people may not have seen the battle royale on

00:09:02.588 --> 00:09:07.529
Thursday. Let's try not to spoil things,
necessarily. We'll try.

00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:13.128
MARISHA: Eh. It's hard not to spoil things.

00:09:13.128 --> 00:09:15.179
MATT: Okay, then do what you will.

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:19.439
MARISHA: They knew what they were getting into
when they showed up at this panel.

00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:22.919
WILLIAM: Talks Machina is usually about the last
episode.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:27.736
MARISHA: Right. I think everyone thought I was
going to win.

00:09:27.736 --> 00:09:29.678
TALIESIN: Yeah, my money was on you.

00:09:30.728 --> 00:09:36.709
MARISHA: I think Grog and I are actually going to
have a rematch because there were a few technical

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:43.959
errors that we both made. In an alternate reality,
Grog is at the bottom of the Water Plane drowning

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:47.409
right now. Furiously pulling out cards.

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:51.249
BRIAN: Why don't we just tell them what we're
going to do? Tell them what we're going to do, Matt.

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:57.836
MARISHA: You want to tell them? I think on an
episode of Talks Machina, probably pretty soon,

00:09:57.836 --> 00:10:02.487
we're going to do a WWE-style one-on-one.

00:10:02.487 --> 00:10:06.809
(cheering)

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:15.199
MARISHA: I want to make wrestling closet cosplay
versions of our character's outfits. Find some

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.618
green unitard to come out in.

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:21.773
BRIAN: I'll probably wear a tuxedo and be like:
are you ready-- Well, that's copyrighted.

00:10:21.773 --> 00:10:26.342
MATT: I'll come dressed as Paul Bearer and be
like, one of you's going to die!

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:34.227
MARISHA: Yeah, I've already talked to Sean Becker.
We're going to do some WWE-style promos leading up

00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:35.118
to it.

00:10:35.118 --> 00:10:36.830
BRIAN: Yeah, it's going to be fun.

00:10:36.849 --> 00:10:40.358
MATT: Grog versus Keyleth. One night only.

00:10:40.358 --> 00:10:46.270
MARISHA: I feel like we knew that Grog and
Keyleth were going to be the two heavy people

00:10:46.293 --> 00:10:47.664
going head to head.

00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:48.870
TALIESIN: Throw down in Tal'Dorei.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.740
BRIAN: We could put it on pay-per-view. Well,
that's kind of what Alpha is, I guess.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.418
(laughter)

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:56.848
WILLIAM: And the second half of that, were there
any abilities or items that you were thinking

00:10:56.848 --> 00:10:59.429
might come up that didn't in the fight?

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:04.087
MARISHA: Percy. Just all of Percy.

00:11:04.087 --> 00:11:15.297
TALIESIN: I rolled so badly. I was just staring--
I rolled three ones, two twos, and only two rolls

00:11:15.297 --> 00:11:23.996
over ten the entire game. I was like, everything's
broken, nothing's working, I'm paste. That's just

00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:25.344
what happens.

00:11:25.344 --> 00:11:31.819
MATT: The thing is, with you as well, you and Grog
both have the highest probability of taking down a

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:36.940
single person in one round of combat. You from
anywhere on the map, and between Bad News and a

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:44.050
well-rolled Violent Shot, you could probably kill
any member of the party, except for Grog, in one hit.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.379
TALIESIN: I'll actually say, and also for people
who are asking, Percy doesn't carry the contract

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:52.178
with him. I know about the contract, and a lot of
people were like, why didn't you pull it out?

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:56.499
That would have not felt-- Percy would not have
done that, and he doesn't carry it because he

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:02.068
doesn't even want the temptation. That thing is
locked away. I think it's locked far away.

00:12:02.068 --> 00:12:04.401
MATT: That's fine, you don't have to have it on
you to invoke the pact.

00:12:04.401 --> 00:12:11.080
(laughter)

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.859
MATT: No, you actually do, it's in the paper.

00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:18.038
WILLIAM: Thank you. Matt, you have a perpetual
standing offer--

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:22.088
BRIAN: Hey, that's three questions now bro! No, I'm
kidding.

00:12:22.088 --> 00:12:25.028
WILLIAM: You have a perpetual standing offer
anytime I'm at a panel, if you want to use

00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:29.188
Frostmourne as a prop or to kill Brian Foster,
you're welcome to ask.

00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:36.577
MATT: I appreciate the offer, however I have
played Frozen Throne, and I know better. I've seen

00:12:36.577 --> 00:12:37.629
what that sword--

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:38.929
WILLIAM: Frostmourne is always waiting.

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:42.466
MATT: No man, I spent way too long getting
Shadowmourne, okay? I'm having flashbacks.

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:43.699
Terrible flashbacks.

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:47.157
BRIAN: Hey dude, I forgot your name, but for
sassing me, come get a Thanks Keyleth pin.

00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:50.397
(cheering)

00:12:50.397 --> 00:12:52.278
MATT: Brian rewards sass.

00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:59.038
TALIESIN: Thank you for encouraging sass.

00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:00.479
RYAN: Hey guys.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.602
MATT: Hey, what's your name?

00:13:01.602 --> 00:13:06.226
RYAN: My name's Ryan. I didn't say it yesterday,
but I'm saying it today. So, first off, spice.

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:09.899
BRIAN: You've got to eat the mic, man, we can
barely-- sorry, the speaker is not very loud.

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:11.712
There you go. That's perfect. It's perfect.

00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:13.129
RYAN: First off, spice.

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:15.027
MATT: Spice. Spice?

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:21.547
RYAN: For Matt, what is your favorite NPC to play
as? For the rest of you, what is your favorite NPC

00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:23.095
to interact with?

00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:33.150
MATT: Oh man. I have a few answers here, because
it's hard to put one in there. Allura is the most

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:40.781
self-insertion character I have in the campaign.
That to me is the most true to myself. Gilmore is

00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:47.220
such a delightful character. I love playing as
him. Interacting as him. Raishan is such a

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:54.296
delicious villain to play as. Yeah, I'm not going
to say much more than that. Raishan was an amazing

00:13:54.296 --> 00:13:56.479
villain to play. So those are my answers.

00:13:57.749 --> 00:14:05.928
MARISHA: Selfishly, we're going to pick characters
that we interact with more. Sun Tree, man.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:09.748
(laughter)

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:10.918
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree.

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.571
MATT: (as Sun Tree) "Thanks, Kiki."

00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:18.499
TALIESIN: If I'm feeling awake and alert, which is
not every game, sometimes I'm tired, Victor's

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:20.837
always fun. But I've got to be prepared.

00:14:20.837 --> 00:14:22.419
(cheering)

00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:27.058
TALIESIN: I don't want to be tired and dealing
with that, because it's going to make my head hurt.

00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:28.958
MATT: <i>Your</i> head hurt?

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.415
BRIAN: That's a good question.

00:14:31.415 --> 00:14:33.998
RYAN: Taliesin, thank you, that's my choice, too.

00:14:37.278 --> 00:14:39.508
MATT: (as Victor) "Learn from my mistakes!"

00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:42.359
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:44.077
JUSTIN: My name is Justin, how are you?

00:14:44.077 --> 00:14:46.557
MATT: Doing well, Justin. How about yourself?

00:14:46.557 --> 00:14:51.608
JUSTIN: I had a quick question for Matt. I was
wondering if you could tell us what your most

00:14:51.608 --> 00:14:55.151
memorable moment as a <i>player</i> of D&amp;D would be.

00:14:55.151 --> 00:15:05.597
MATT: Oh man, that's a great question. I'd have to
say... I was playing a dwarven fighter, my first time

00:15:05.597 --> 00:15:13.927
playing a combat class, because I was always casters,
named Kradin Grimthorne who I named the Brawlers'

00:15:13.936 --> 00:15:20.738
League dwarf who ended up representing you guys
after. I kind of used that character in this one.

00:15:20.738 --> 00:15:27.808
But it was just playing a really angry, tough
little son of a bitch. At one point, we were

00:15:27.828 --> 00:15:33.868
climbing down this big ravine where this magical
tower was at the bottom that was in the recess to

00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:38.357
stay hidden. There was somebody in there we had to
talk to. So we were climbing down this hundreds

00:15:38.357 --> 00:15:43.377
and hundreds of feet with our climbing gear, and
at that moment we started being assaulted by

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:49.028
wyverns that had nested into the side of this
hill. As they start running out, and swiping down

00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:52.138
and attacking, the rest of the party is like, "Oh
my god, we got to go!" and they're all climbing

00:15:52.138 --> 00:16:00.649
down quickly and trying to get down as fast as
they can. I was like, "No! I think one of these

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:07.146
"can hold my weight. I'm going to wait until one of
them comes for me." The DM was like, "Okay, you

00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:14.307
"realize you're still 600 feet up from the bottom
of the ravine," and I'm like, "Oh, I know." So I'm

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:19.346
just holding my action, and holding my action,
with my hand on the rope, and one wyvern swipes in

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:24.592
to strike, I take the hits, and I'm like, "I
grapple him." "All right, roll for it." I grab on,

00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:28.995
and I manage to get up onto the wyvern and onto
its back and clutch it by the back of the neck and

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:34.442
start trying to coast it into the side of the
ravine to try and control it and knock it a little

00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:41.644
dizzy. I proceed to roll really well, then really
poorly, then really well, and in the process both

00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:47.362
of us get bludgeoned by the side of the ravine
within an inch of our life. Eventually, getting it

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:51.465
down to the bottom before the rest of the party, I
actually swoop past them and they're all

00:16:51.465 --> 00:16:59.183
screaming, "What are you doing?" I'm like, "Doing
what a dwarf does, win!" I slam it into the bottom

00:16:59.183 --> 00:17:03.313
of the ravine and we both go tumbling over, I have
three hit points left, it's on the ground going

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:10.445
(snarling). It's trying to get itself back up, and
I walk up, pull out my ax and I'm like, "I win."

00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:15.433
Shwoop, and I took its head off as a trophy, wore
it on my belt for a while. It got really stinky, I

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:20.433
didn't care, I wanted people to see what I did!
That was Grimthorne.

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:22.253
JUSTIN: Thank you very much.

00:17:22.253 --> 00:17:23.994
(cheering)

00:17:23.994 --> 00:17:28.423
BRIAN: That's the coolest story I've ever heard in
my entire life. Hey, what's your name?

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.024
DAMIEN: I'm Damien, or as I introduced myself to
you guys yesterday, the even more shitty Brian

00:17:34.024 --> 00:17:35.100
Wayne Foster.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.891
BRIAN: That's right. All right, you're getting a
Free Denise pin when you're done, so come up and

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.711
grab it after.

00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:45.249
DAMIEN: This is my question for Matt. From one DM
to another, one of my favorite characters you've

00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:53.782
ever introduced was Kynan. How do you create such
realistic and good NPCs in your campaign?

00:17:53.782 --> 00:18:06.478
MATT: Part of what helps with the training of an
actor, is really what we do as actors is the study

00:18:06.478 --> 00:18:12.969
of human beings, and the study of the human
condition, the complexities of a person, so coming

00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:18.647
to it from that standpoint, when you create an
NPC, you think, okay, what abilities they have,

00:18:18.647 --> 00:18:23.564
what classes they are, what their background is,
what faction they work for, are they good, are

00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:30.279
they bad, what loot do they have, that's the core
skeleton. But then you consider, what are their

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:36.169
passions, what are their goals, what is it they're
ultimately trying to achieve, and how far are they

00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:41.978
willing to go to achieve that? Then you consider
what are their deepest fears, what are the things

00:18:41.978 --> 00:18:46.492
that drive them to desperation, what are the
things that drive them to flee, what are the

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:56.749
things that drive them to discard allies. Then you
begin to break down subtleties of their history

00:18:56.749 --> 00:19:03.608
and their personality. Really, one of the keys you
come to is even villains have a reason to how they

00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:10.958
got there. Really good villains are those that you
can understand why they became villains. It

00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:17.339
doesn't mean you have to necessarily feel bad for
them, but there is a throughline of going, okay, I

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:22.829
understand why this individual became who they
are. Many villains don't see themselves as

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:27.899
villains, they see themselves as doing what's
necessary for the greater good, and not realize

00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:37.858
the ramifications of their actions. So honestly,
studying characters, studying people, and a lot of

00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:43.779
the basics of creating a character from a
performer's standpoint can work really well with

00:19:43.779 --> 00:19:52.937
the creation of characters for your game, that
will feel more breathing and living and intricate.

00:19:52.937 --> 00:19:55.998
In my opinion.

00:19:55.998 --> 00:20:01.440
BRIAN: That's a great answer. Thank you very
much. Go ahead. What's your name?

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.800
NICK: My name's Nick.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.917
BRIAN: Damien, get over here.

00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:07.577
(laughter)

00:20:07.577 --> 00:20:09.007
TALIESIN: I was going to say.

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:14.207
NICK: So my question is for all of you. A little
bit of context: my character just finished a major

00:20:14.207 --> 00:20:17.218
quest and it ended with them at a trial.

00:20:17.218 --> 00:20:18.888
MATT: You need to talk a little closer to the mic,
sir.

00:20:18.888 --> 00:20:19.348
NICK: Hello?

00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:20.862
MATT: There we go.

00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:26.097
NICK: So my players just finished a big quest
where they were accused of a crime, and they were

00:20:26.097 --> 00:20:30.959
trying to prove their innocence. Well, they
figured it out and they accused the right person,

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:35.740
and at the end of it she was supposed to freak out
and scream at the party and go nuts as she was

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:41.808
about to be put to death, but when the moment came
I flopped, I got too nervous to scream at my

00:20:41.808 --> 00:20:46.178
players and get in character. My question to you
guys is, as performers and especially as voice

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:52.158
actors, how do you guys get into a character and
just scream at them and kind of forget your

00:20:52.158 --> 00:20:56.638
nervousness, your stage fright, especially as
voice actors. Because, I mean, when you were

00:20:56.638 --> 00:21:01.199
Symphior, you were screaming your head off. I
don't know how I could have done that. How did you

00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:02.338
guys get over that?

00:21:02.338 --> 00:21:03.437
BRIAN: Did you catch that?

00:21:03.437 --> 00:21:03.949
MATT: Yeah.

00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:04.870
TALIESIN: Practice.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.748
MARISHA: You kind of lose yourself, I think, a
little bit. Is my mic on?

00:21:11.748 --> 00:21:16.079
BRIAN: Can we get the-- Is there someone at the
sound booth? Denise, is there someone back there?

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:21.892
Could we get our microphones in the wedges, and
then also the microphone that the people are

00:21:21.892 --> 00:21:26.891
asking the questions from isn't really coming out
of here very loud, so it's a little-- If we can

00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:30.440
just get all those up, all the way, I think.
'Cause whenever Marisha and Taliesin are talking,

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.227
all I hear is (gibberish).

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:43.263
MARISHA: I'm just going to project really loud.
You kind of, I think, lose yourself in it a little bit.

00:21:43.263 --> 00:21:47.927
TALIESIN: One of the things that acting training
does, one of the first things they do, is they sit

00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:52.927
down and go, "All right, we're going to work very,
very hard on removing all of your shame, because

00:21:52.927 --> 00:21:56.575
you're not going to be able to do your job if you
have any of that."

00:21:56.575 --> 00:22:03.465
AUDIO TECH: Ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you
please speak up when you ask the questions. You're

00:22:03.465 --> 00:22:09.249
out in front of the speakers, we have to pick it
up to send it back to the stage. If you talk soft,

00:22:09.249 --> 00:22:13.868
they can't hear you, and I am going to roll your
vocal mics into the monitors.

00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:15.338
ALL: Thank you very much.

00:22:15.338 --> 00:22:26.598
TALIESIN: But yeah. Removing that shame is not
easy, and is a long and arduous process that-- Oh,

00:22:26.598 --> 00:22:36.628
hello. Yes, that's lovely. I wish I had a really
good cheat for it other than-- I started by

00:22:36.628 --> 00:22:43.107
performing and getting weird in the car. That's a
great place to be weird, because no one can see

00:22:43.107 --> 00:22:48.387
you, and then sometimes you notice people see you
and then you get okay with that, of just singing

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:56.288
something ridiculous. Kesha is good, I'm trying to
think who else. There's some good stuff sing to

00:22:56.288 --> 00:22:57.516
feel really ridiculous.

00:22:57.516 --> 00:23:00.877
MATT: You now all have the image of Taliesin
singing Kesha to himself in his car.

00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:03.829
(cheering)

00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:08.396
MARISHA: I mean, that's not a bad point though,
like karaoke, going out and dancing in public.

00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:15.049
That's all little things that can help you get
more comfortable with making-- you're going to

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.969
look ridiculous every once in a while, and we all
will, and just embrace that.

00:23:20.969 --> 00:23:25.691
TALIESIN: And weirdly, other people's reactions to
you being ridiculous will slowly make you feel

00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:29.610
better, because it's never going to be the
reactions you're afraid of. It's actually

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:36.218
strangely positive, to be like, (crazy voice) "I
don't care, woo!" Because people go--

00:23:36.218 --> 00:23:46.080
MATT: In the same way that you're saying, "I wish
I could let go like we do," other people will see

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.854
you and go, "I wish I could let go like you do."
It's a good feedback loop, and that just gets you

00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:55.494
a little more comfortable with the idea that
sometimes that fear you have of people judging

00:23:55.494 --> 00:24:01.222
you, one, doesn't matter, two, isn't what you
think it is, and three, it's a very freeing

00:24:01.222 --> 00:24:06.853
experience to just express yourself for the pure
joy of what you want to express.

00:24:06.853 --> 00:24:10.874
TALIESIN: It takes a while to beat that out of
your system, though. It's tough.

00:24:10.874 --> 00:24:17.332
MARISHA: And we've also been playing these
characters for five years now. We know them inside

00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:24.246
and out. We can just drop into them so easily,
which is why Taliesin can improv insane

00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:33.113
monologues, or why I can scream at Raishan and try
and just plant myself in Keyleth's head. It

00:24:33.113 --> 00:24:35.903
definitely takes time and reckless abandon.

00:24:35.903 --> 00:24:40.216
MATT: And at the game table, remind yourself that
the players that are there for you are there <i>for</i>

00:24:40.216 --> 00:24:45.671
you, they're supportive of you, and they're
engaging in the same way you are. If you're afraid

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:51.613
about getting that intense about it, just remind
yourself that they-- one, they will be blown away

00:24:51.613 --> 00:24:57.301
when you do manage to cross that threshold, and
two, they're there to support you and want to see

00:24:57.301 --> 00:25:02.911
you get into it as much as you want to as well. So
you have to remind yourself as best you can that

00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:06.952
they're not going to judge you for it by any
means. They're there cheering you on.

00:25:06.952 --> 00:25:10.770
MARISHA: And if they do, shame on them and find
another game group.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:11.821
BRIAN: Shame!

00:25:11.821 --> 00:25:13.721
(cheering)

00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:17.323
TALIESIN: Thanks, Mom. That's the most mom advice

00:25:17.323 --> 00:25:19.669
BRIAN: What's your name?

00:25:20.217 --> 00:25:23.200
ELIJAH: Is it okay if I take the mic out?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.270
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.909
MATT: As long as you put it back.

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:31.729
ELIJAH: It's not moving, so I'm just gonna crouch.
I'm sorry, because my friends are making me be

00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:33.501
this guy, but can you say, "It's high noon"?

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:35.663
(groaning)

00:25:35.663 --> 00:25:37.830
BRIAN: Oh, that is-- Do you have ten thousand
dollars?

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.678
(laughter)

00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:41.512
ELIJAH: If I say yes, will you still do it?

00:25:41.512 --> 00:25:43.418
MATT: (McCree voice) Oh, you know what time it
is.

00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:45.430
(cheering)

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.779
ELIJAH: Okay, thank you!

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:49.372
MATT: (McCree voice) It's high noon.

00:25:49.372 --> 00:25:50.851
(cheering)

00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:51.675
MATT: There you go.

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:53.360
TALIESIN: I think I just won money on that one.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.040
MARISHA: It's actually 1:25.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.400
MATT: (McCree voice) It's 1:26.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:07.250
ELIJAH: So my actual question is, recently I got
done doing a campaign with one of my friends, and

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:14.459
I was playing as a voidling; whoever he consumes,
he takes on part of their attributes. When it

00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:21.881
comes to characters like that, where they adapt to
whoever they kill or consume, what type of

00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:29.169
hindrances or recoils or feedbacks do you suggest
that I implement so he's not just like Gilgamesh

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:34.150
from Fate/stay: "Oh shit, let's just throw
infinite weapons! Yay!"

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:39.689
MATT: Well, I mean, things that you can consider
for balance are: if you're gaining attributes of

00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:43.891
whatever you've eaten, does it replace the
attributes that you've previously devoured? So the

00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:50.410
adaptation could be you only consume and take on
the attributes of what you've currently taken in.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.400
That's a balance, so it's more of an adaptation
that switches as opposed to just a constant

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.040
building effect. Or they could be temporary:
whatever you consume, it affects your attributes

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.642
for a short period of time and then eventually
fades away. So you could bulk up and get pretty

00:27:04.642 --> 00:27:09.070
powerful for a short time, but you can say that if
you consume more than three or four entities

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.779
within a short period of time, it could be
damaging or dangerous to your health.

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:19.144
TALIESIN: Maybe you also get their lowest
attribute as well. Like no matter what-- for

00:27:19.144 --> 00:27:21.610
whatever bonus you get, you get pulled down as
well.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:27.257
MATT: So considering those are possibilities, as
opposed to just being a character that, "Oh, hope

00:27:27.257 --> 00:27:33.899
you guys enjoy your longswords. I'm just going to
eat the world and become a god."

00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:36.070
(laughter)

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:43.490
ELIJAH: My character in the beginning, everybody
just kind of escapes from prison, so he

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.710
accidentally consumed the heart of a dragon god,
and it's the only attribute that stayed with him

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:53.550
the entire time. So is that kind of fair or am I
being kind of being god-ish?

00:27:53.550 --> 00:28:01.195
MATT: I mean, it's up to you working with the GM
on what is fair and what isn't. Just because you

00:28:01.195 --> 00:28:04.472
devour the heart of a dragon god doesn't mean you
now have the powers of a dragon god, it means you

00:28:04.472 --> 00:28:09.480
have the potential to eventually unlock the powers
of a dragon god, so your journey could be learning

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.931
slowly over time how to unlock those abilities. So
you grow with the rest of the party.

00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:17.420
TALIESIN: You'd just be very insufferable for a
while. I imagine that would be fun.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.213
MATT: So yeah, there are ways to balance it but
the GM has to work with you on that and make sure

00:28:22.213 --> 00:28:26.318
that it's in line, so that it doesn't feel unfair
for the rest of the players, but you still get to

00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:29.522
play through those narrative elements in a way
that's fun for you and your character to

00:28:29.522 --> 00:28:29.922
progress.

00:28:29.922 --> 00:28:33.990
ELIJAH: All right, thank you. I didn't get to say
my name. My name is Elijah.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.084
MATT: Thank you, buddy!

00:28:35.084 --> 00:28:38.513
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

00:28:38.513 --> 00:28:40.100
JOE: Hey, my name is Joe.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.168
ALL: Hey, Joe!

00:28:41.168 --> 00:28:49.961
JOE: My question is partially twofold. For Matt,
the character Taryon Darrington. How far in

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:55.039
advance did you know that he was going to pop up?
And for everyone else, how long did it take you to

00:28:55.039 --> 00:29:00.525
get accustomed to him instead of the person that
he kind of replaced? I don't want to give spoilers

00:29:00.525 --> 00:29:02.140
for somebody who hasn't seen it yet.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:09.040
MATT: Yeah. Well, Sam and I had discussed Taryon
for about three weeks-- about two or three weeks

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:15.427
in advance, since the end of the Conclave arc--
and the scenarios that his character had gone

00:29:15.427 --> 00:29:22.185
through that had led him to feel it might be
necessary, depending on how the conversation goes

00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:27.703
with the rest of the party, of him to either stay
or leave. We had made this character as a backup

00:29:27.703 --> 00:29:33.859
just in case he decided to leave. So we had met
and we had designed-- he told me the theory behind

00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:37.391
the character of Taryon and what he wanted to him
to be, and I told him, "Well, that kind of fits in

00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:41.032
with these classes," and the one he liked best was
the artificer. He was like, "Oh, that sounds

00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:44.702
exactly what we're trying to do." And so he's
like, "I want to be a character that has very

00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:49.288
little real-life experience but has enough money
to make himself powerful." So he became the trust

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:56.400
fund baby of D&amp;D characters. From a mechanical
standpoint, Taryon, without any of his equipment,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.921
is like level two, but put all of his equipment on
and he's level 14, 15, was our thought process

00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:07.903
behind it. He made the character and had him in
the wings, and then based on whatever happened

00:30:07.903 --> 00:30:14.390
that episode, it seemed that Sam decided to leave.
And as such, that very same episode we brought

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.880
Taryon in, which I think was a little sooner than
Sam was anticipating.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.909
TALIESIN: He was not prepared. He was like, "Oh,
okay. This is apparently happening."

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:25.242
MARISHA: You went up to him during the break and
you were like, "All right, Tary, you're up." And

00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:29.529
he was like, "What? No, next week." And you were
like, "Now."

00:30:29.529 --> 00:30:34.314
MATT: You guys went there immediately, and it was
a good button for the episode.

00:30:34.314 --> 00:30:42.731
BRIAN: He was looking at his half-filled-out
papers like, "What do I do?"

00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:44.729
MATT and BRIAN: He did great.

00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:49.131
TALIESIN: It took about three episodes to get
really used to, I feel like. Three episodes in, I

00:30:49.131 --> 00:30:54.742
was like-- I thought it was good for us, because
we'd been worried about-- a lot of our players, I

00:30:54.742 --> 00:30:59.580
think we're the only-- Us and Liam are the only
ones who've actually played any other character.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.850
And so I think there's been a little bit of
nervousness about what's going to happen when that

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.119
happens, and I feel a lot better.

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:13.811
MARISHA: Yeah, people embraced it. The first two,
three games we were rejecting him like a noob.

00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:18.620
TALIESIN: You are not my father! You don't get to
tell me what to do.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.819
MATT: Good question, thank you.

00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:24.620
BRIAN: Great question, thanks, Joe. Hey, what's
your name?

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.128
LAURA: Hi, I'm Laura.

00:31:28.128 --> 00:31:29.260
ALL: Hi, Laura.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:35.955
LAURA: Before I ask my question, I just wanted to
say thank you to all of you up there, except for

00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:36.402
Brian.

00:31:36.402 --> 00:31:43.431
(laughter)

00:31:43.431 --> 00:31:45.334
TALIESIN: It's everything I could have hoped for
and more.

00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:56.511
LAURA: I work as a night shift security guard, and
you guys fill my nights because I'm way behind.

00:31:56.511 --> 00:31:58.550
TALIESIN: We are there for you.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:05.231
LAURA: I am way behind on Critical Role, but I'm
working on it. I've been sitting at the edge of my

00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:12.779
seat waiting for Grog to beat that half-orc and
crying my eyes out during the Briarwood arcs,

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:21.989
getting super excited with Keyleth going through
the fire rift. It was just so amazing, and I just

00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:27.080
wanted to thank you so much for that, because it
makes my life better.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.718
MATT: Thank you for coming along with us.

00:32:28.718 --> 00:32:32.769
MARISHA: And sticking around for 100 episodes.

00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:44.600
LAURA: For my question, it's kind of for all of
you, but it's a two-sided question. I'm been DMing

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:51.259
my own campaign and I feel like it's stagnating a
little bit because I've gotten a little frustrated

00:32:51.259 --> 00:33:01.349
with my characters, with my players. Matt, what do
you do when everybody just either gets wonderful

00:33:01.349 --> 00:33:06.731
rolls and is just blowing through everything, or
makes all the right turns over and over again,

00:33:06.731 --> 00:33:15.380
even when you want them to go into the wrong way
because you want to torture them? Taliesin and

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.519
Marisha, how do you guys know when you're doing
that to Matt?

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:27.818
MATT: To answer your question, what happens if
there is no right way? What happens if every path

00:33:27.818 --> 00:33:30.228
is the really wrong, horrible, torturing way?

00:33:30.228 --> 00:33:32.499
TALIESIN: Kobayashi that stuff. Blow it up.

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:38.641
LAURA: And your dragonborn jumps down a pool
that's 600 feet and drowns on the way back up.

00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:39.787
That's what happens.

00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:49.775
MATT: Exactly. And let that be a lesson to him.
It's a delicate balance, being a GM or a DM. It's

00:33:49.775 --> 00:33:56.296
creating challenge without feeling like it's
unfair, and not challenging them all the time,

00:33:56.296 --> 00:33:59.440
because you want the players to also have time
where they feel like they're having a good time,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.172
or they're kicking ass and enjoying the battle, as
opposed to always being under the threat of

00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:08.060
constant bludgeoning death. You have to find that
balance.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.840
BRIAN: Like Taliesin just said about consequence
versus punishment, too. Tell these people that,

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.331
because we were in a room with different people.

00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:21.370
TALIESIN: We were in a press room. A good DM, in
my opinion, knows the difference between

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:27.900
consequence and punishment. You don't punish your
players for making the wrong decision. You don't

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.676
punish them for going off the rails. You don't
punish them for staying on the rails. You create

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:38.741
consequence. There was a guy up a second ago who
was talking about that all his players got accused

00:34:38.741 --> 00:34:46.410
falsely of a crime and then they found the real
guilty person and dealt with it, he was talking

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:51.551
about that. What if most of the world still
doesn't know they found the right person and just

00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:56.983
all assumes that they're guilty and still got off
and just treats them like dirt? For months? That

00:34:56.983 --> 00:35:00.651
would be amazing. And now they're just ostracized
and everybody hates them.

00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:03.308
MATT: I was about to say, what if they get to the
guilty person and the guilty person kills

00:35:03.308 --> 00:35:07.830
themself, and they're found with the dead body of
the guilty party with no way of proving innocence,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.620
and they have another body on their hands to now
have to flee the town.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.330
BRIAN: You've thought about this.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:22.118
TALIESIN: Make life be unfair. Like, just be
unfair. Don't be mean, but you can stack the odds

00:35:22.118 --> 00:35:27.989
against them. I love "No right answer." Kobayashi
that. Terrible situations where something awful is

00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:29.750
going to happen no matter what.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.910
MATT: And remember, if they're always rolling well
and they're always just blowing through every

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.301
encounter, throw a couple tarrasques at them.

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:38.770
(laughter)

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.110
MARISHA: What are you two talking about?!

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.030
MATT: It's called teaching humility.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:48.471
BRIAN: Wow. Wow! All right, Laura, come up here,
'cause you got the How Do You Want To Do This pin

00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:49.321
signed by--

00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:54.489
(cheering)

00:35:54.489 --> 00:35:55.999
MATT: You look awesome, by the way.

00:35:58.179 --> 00:35:58.930
ROB: Hello.

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:00.638
MATT: Hello. What's your name, sir?

00:36:00.638 --> 00:36:01.620
ROB: My name's Rob.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.471
MATT: Rob, hello!

00:36:02.471 --> 00:36:07.618
ROB: Matt, thank you so much for bringing all of
your friends here. Glad you came last year, glad

00:36:07.618 --> 00:36:12.069
you brought more of the crew. And Brian, I don't
know what problem Laura had with you, I'm so glad

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:14.782
that you and your hair are here. You put on your
beard today.

00:36:16.702 --> 00:36:20.180
BRIAN: Thank you. Yes, it's velcroed on. Thank
you, that's really sweet.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.309
ROB: You pull it off. Every night before you go to
sleep.

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:26.089
(laughter)

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:28.911
TALIESIN: They're learning. I'm so proud. They're
learning.

00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:35.610
BRIAN: Let me see what this guys gets. Hold on.
Let me get my wallet out, there. All right, you'll

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.274
get a Free Denise pin, too, after.

00:36:38.754 --> 00:36:46.182
ROB: My question is to Golden Gods and Life Needs
Things to Live. I know you guys started this game

00:36:46.182 --> 00:36:51.380
back in Pathfinder and transitioned to Fifth
Edition, where it rewards you for coming up with

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.089
every little thing about your character:
personality traits, flaws, bonds, ideals, and

00:36:56.089 --> 00:37:02.422
such. But over the course of the game, you tend to
discover more things about your character than

00:37:02.422 --> 00:37:08.701
were there in the beginning. So what is something
that, while playing under Matt, has surprised you

00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:11.019
about the character that you created?

00:37:11.019 --> 00:37:12.589
MATT: That's a cool question.

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:14.379
BRIAN: That's a fantastic question.

00:37:15.539 --> 00:37:19.195
MARISHA: Especially, kind of like we were saying,
we've been playing these characters for so long

00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:28.508
that they're having the life of people. I know
I've probably changed a lot in five years, and

00:37:28.508 --> 00:37:33.239
these people are put in very extreme
circumstances, so I think you just have to be open

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:39.800
to that. We all have our core values that we stick
to, and then you have to let the world still

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.591
affect you.

00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:48.699
TALIESIN: Your reality with Kerrek, I remember,
changed your whole plotting quite a bit. You were

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.011
getting kind of aggro.

00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:58.576
MARISHA: Yeah. There was a time where-- because
when I started Keyleth, she was naive and juvenile

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:04.531
and just thought that the whole world was like a
magical Disney forest filled with animals and

00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:10.990
things that loved me, and then the reality is
that's not the case at all. And there for a while,

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:16.991
she was getting very angry because that was just
the way the world was beating down upon us for a

00:38:16.991 --> 00:38:24.629
while, getting angry at the fact that, why did no
one tell her about this? And it wasn't until Kerr

00:38:24.629 --> 00:38:32.071
stepped in as that substitute father figure to--
and, at the time, Vox Machina, you guys were being

00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:38.139
total dicks to Keyleth! You were like, "Deal with
it, druid." You were!

00:38:38.139 --> 00:38:39.840
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I remember.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.971
MARISHA: And he was the first one who-- because
that's when she was having panics about, "We're

00:38:44.971 --> 00:38:52.780
not heroes. Look at the trail of destruction we've
left behind us!" And he was the first one to

00:38:52.780 --> 00:39:00.172
relate to Keyleth on that level. So there were
several things. There was dealing with the fact

00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:04.662
that I felt like my party wasn't really supporting
Keyleth at the time, that my people who were

00:39:04.662 --> 00:39:09.611
supposed to be my closest friends, and then there
was this guy who was just a guest who came in for

00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:16.959
an episode who totally changed everything. Because
I was getting really heavy into almost dropping

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:23.501
points of barbarian into Keyleth and having her be
like, "Screw it! I'm done. I'm done with all of

00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:29.562
this. Why do we need to do any--" And just get
angry. But then he put her back on that track,

00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:30.442
which was good.

00:39:30.442 --> 00:39:35.571
TALIESIN: I call your current track, in my head,
it's the "be the Lisa Frank you want to see in the world."

00:39:35.571 --> 00:39:37.711
(laughter)

00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:40.932
TALIESIN: Come on, guys! It's pretty good.

00:39:40.932 --> 00:39:43.362
MARISHA: Let's make a more rainbow tomorrow!

00:39:43.822 --> 00:39:52.281
TALIESIN: Hey, Sun Tree. Yeah. One of my core
principles-- I like that D&amp;D has those little

00:39:52.281 --> 00:40:00.740
Fifth Edition boxes, but I always see that as
either-- and there's nothing wrong with training

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.961
wheels, we all need them-- as a good way of
helping you be--

00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:06.501
BRIAN: There's nothing wrong with training
wheels.

00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:10.153
TALIESIN: There's nothing wrong with training
wheels. Sometimes, if you haven't been acting for

00:40:10.153 --> 00:40:16.919
30 years, it's nice to have a box that teaches you
some basics. Or if you're playing a one-shot, it's

00:40:16.919 --> 00:40:21.953
a good way of remembering who you are and what
you're doing, which is important for anybody. But

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:26.570
I've never filled those boxes out for Percy at
all. I don't think any of us filled any of those

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.172
boxes out.

00:40:27.172 --> 00:40:31.491
MATT: By the time we'd gotten over the edition
transition, you knew the characters so well and

00:40:31.491 --> 00:40:32.954
what those were, you didn't need to--

00:40:32.954 --> 00:40:35.089
TALIESIN: Unless I'm playing a one-shot, I never
fill those out anyway.

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:39.860
MARISHA: One of the best times I've seen those
boxes utilized, though, those background boxes,

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.712
was with Dan Casey on the one-shot that you did. I
think it was episode 12, I think that's still out

00:40:45.712 --> 00:40:53.211
there. We watched Dan Casey roll, because they're
all numbered to where you can roll a d8, so if

00:40:53.211 --> 00:40:58.191
you're really confused and you don't know, you can
roll a d8 and be like, "Four, okay, I'm paranoid

00:40:58.191 --> 00:41:08.842
of water." So he rolled, found the things, and
then came up with a backstory and that was how he

00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:13.500
got Salty Pete, who was a dual-wielding pirate
sellsword.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.521
TALIESIN: It's a great episode.

00:41:16.521 --> 00:41:24.963
MARISHA: It was a great character with a
background that he didn't get so stuck and caught

00:41:24.963 --> 00:41:29.019
on what it was going to be that it didn't allow
him to still have fun.

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:31.800
ROB: That was the first episode with the
Snugglelord, right?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.767
ALL: Yes, it was.

00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:35.563
MARISHA: When you were walking people through.

00:41:35.563 --> 00:41:39.730
TALIESIN: Yeah, Percy was supposed to never be
happy. That was one of his core character traits,

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.941
is somebody who will never be happy with himself
or the world around him, and will always be, on a

00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:51.392
core level, irritated at himself and others.
Mostly himself. And not anymore! I was like, what

00:41:51.392 --> 00:41:56.860
happens if he just lets that go finally and is
like, fine, forget it. I deserve a little

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:05.376
happiness. He's getting dangerous. I'm enjoying
it. Something's going to snap terribly. I'm really excited.

00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:07.221
MATT: Happy Percy is a bad idea.

00:42:07.661 --> 00:42:10.282
MARISHA: It's true, your sorrow contained you.

00:42:10.942 --> 00:42:16.251
TALIESIN: Yeah. All it took was a bad
relationship, a really inappropriate relationship,

00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:18.491
to ruin everything. I'm so excited.

00:42:18.491 --> 00:42:20.270
MATT: That's usually how it works, though, in real
life.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:24.822
TALIESIN: Oh no, it really is! It's such a
flashback to 22, 23. It's great.

00:42:25.922 --> 00:42:29.070
BRIAN: That's a great question. Come collect your
pin, please.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:36.662
MATT: Hello again.

00:42:36.662 --> 00:42:39.791
Lee: Hello! My name's Lee.

00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:41.036
MATT: Hi, Lee!

00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:47.550
LEE: Last night I told you guys about my drow
sorcerer who is currently a potted plant.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.641
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. Speak with Plants.

00:42:50.641 --> 00:43:04.560
LEE: Yeah, so that's fine. I have a question for
Matt. How long have you sat on the major events

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:16.854
for Vox Machina? The Briarwoods, the Chroma
Conclave, whatever we're going to get with the Orb

00:43:16.854 --> 00:43:23.471
of Doom. How long have you been sitting on these
and waiting?

00:43:23.471 --> 00:43:28.463
MATT: The Briarwoods I've been sitting on since
Percy gave me his character backstory. The minute

00:43:28.463 --> 00:43:31.370
he turned that page in, and I read it, I was like,
oh, this is going to be so sweet when we get to

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:39.499
it. It's going to be so good. The Conclave I've
been sitting on for about two years before I

00:43:39.499 --> 00:43:44.521
dropped on that, because when I began to develop
them-- My main reason for doing the Conclave was

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:48.222
I'd been DMing for so many years and I just didn't
use dragons. This game is called Dungeons &amp;

00:43:48.222 --> 00:43:53.441
Dragons, and I never got around to really using
big ancient dragons. I've always wanted to do that.

00:43:53.452 --> 00:43:56.572
BRIAN: Why? Because you never played long enough
for the campaigns to--

00:43:56.572 --> 00:44:00.244
MATT: Because some campaigns ended before I could
get to that power level. I didn't want it being

00:44:00.244 --> 00:44:08.908
like, oh, you're fighting a baby dragon, ooh! I
wanted big, scary, classic dragons, but the

00:44:08.908 --> 00:44:13.759
campaigns didn't go on long enough, or
thematically the dragons didn't fit for it. The

00:44:13.759 --> 00:44:18.656
villains and the world where they were, it would
have felt shoehorned if I put them in there. So I

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:23.505
was like, I'm not just going to bring a dragon,
I'm going to bring all of them in, bring one of

00:44:23.505 --> 00:44:28.581
each chromatic dragon. I decided that would be a
Conclave, but they would never work together. What

00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:33.416
would bring them together? It would be the one,
the dominant, the alpha essentially, which is the

00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:37.105
Thordak character, and Raishan being the sly
manipulator, and the combination of those two

00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:45.988
would make it a tenuous agreement between this
Conclave. I developed this and realized, in order

00:44:45.988 --> 00:44:50.577
for this to be impactful, it has to be at a time
when they're at the height of their success. When

00:44:50.577 --> 00:44:56.245
it feels like everything is fine and good. So I
sat on it and I set the scene, I began to plant

00:44:56.245 --> 00:45:01.617
the seeds of its eventual release, and then waited
for them to complete a series of arcs.

00:45:01.617 --> 00:45:05.765
TALIESIN: Waiting for Liam to make that speech.
That was amazing.

00:45:05.765 --> 00:45:08.775
MATT: That was amazing! I'm sitting here, like,
they're back in Emon, they had their celebration,

00:45:08.775 --> 00:45:15.225
they were all lauded before the people of Emon.
They were having a crisis, an existential crisis

00:45:15.225 --> 00:45:21.437
of, "What do we do now? What holds us together?
What are we? What purpose do we have? Are we still

00:45:21.437 --> 00:45:25.871
adventurers? Have we done any good in the world? I
don't know what's going on."

00:45:25.871 --> 00:45:29.786
MARISHA: Because arguably if there's no
adventuring for Vox Machina, we're just a group of

00:45:29.786 --> 00:45:30.827
shitty people.

00:45:32.107 --> 00:45:34.096
BRIAN: Who eat douchebags for breakfast.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:39.027
TALIESIN: That's the next t-shirt: Just a group of
shitty people.

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:44.186
MARISHA: The adventuring has to be happening or
we're just awful.

00:45:45.366 --> 00:45:49.485
MATT: To be fair, so is most any adventuring
party, and I think you can all attest to that.

00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:55.767
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Tary points it out a lot, which
I really enjoy, of like, you're terrible people.

00:45:55.767 --> 00:45:57.621
Yes, we are! Woo!

00:45:59.391 --> 00:46:06.133
MATT: So yeah, it takes a lot of patience to sit
on a story that long. I remember that episode when

00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:10.203
Liam said that, when he's like, "What are we going
to do, what's next? I feel like there's no

00:46:10.203 --> 00:46:14.528
purpose." I'm like, ooh, man! Give me like 40
minutes!

00:46:14.528 --> 00:46:16.836
(laughter)

00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:18.215
MATT: So yeah, that was amazing.

00:46:18.215 --> 00:46:19.228
BRIAN: Great question.

00:46:19.228 --> 00:46:26.245
MATT: The sphere thing is coming to fruition
slowly now, and I've been sitting on that since I

00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:28.046
was designing the Briarwood arc.

00:46:28.046 --> 00:46:29.087
TALIESIN: Long time.

00:46:29.087 --> 00:46:30.734
MATT: That one I've probably been sitting on the
longest.

00:46:30.734 --> 00:46:33.805
TALIESIN: I was about to say, maybe the sphere is
not going to come up until the next campaign for

00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.066
all we know. I have no idea.

00:46:35.066 --> 00:46:36.529
MATT: Yeah. We'll see where it comes up.

00:46:36.529 --> 00:46:37.881
LEE: All right, thanks..

00:46:37.881 --> 00:46:44.480
BRIAN: Such a tease. Hello. What's your name?

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.126
CHRISTEN: My name's Christen.

00:46:46.126 --> 00:46:47.416
MATT: Hi, Christen.

00:46:47.416 --> 00:46:48.856
CHRISTEN: Hello.

00:46:48.856 --> 00:46:50.656
TALIESIN: Bend it to your will. There you go.

00:46:50.656 --> 00:46:52.097
MATT: You look awesome, by the way.

00:46:52.097 --> 00:47:03.854
CHRISTEN: Thank you. The question is technically
for all of y'all. If you could choose another

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:11.139
class besides the one that your character is, what
would it have done, and how do you think it would

00:47:11.139 --> 00:47:13.436
have affected their progression?

00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:16.414
MARISHA: Oh, interesting. Same characters,
different class?

00:47:16.414 --> 00:47:19.797
MATT: Player. That's my class.

00:47:19.797 --> 00:47:23.083
(laughter)

00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:31.814
TALIESIN: Oh, just a player, nice. I think maybe
if Percy had never become an engineer, I would

00:47:31.814 --> 00:47:36.073
have loved to have stayed in fighter class, but
maybe a fighter class and become like a really

00:47:36.073 --> 00:47:44.507
poncy fencer, which would have been in the Errol
Flynn style. "Ha ha!" Just can't build anything. I

00:47:44.507 --> 00:47:50.285
don't know, because he thinks magic's weird. The
rules are all mish-mosh.

00:47:53.105 --> 00:47:59.017
MARISHA: I don't know. I was mentioning earlier if
I would've dropped points of barbarian in Keyleth

00:47:59.017 --> 00:48:08.515
and gone a half-and-half route. Then gone more of
a melee brawler. Because I could rage and go into

00:48:08.515 --> 00:48:16.197
my beast shaping forms, and then get all the bonus
that Grog gets when he rages. So it would be nasty

00:48:16.197 --> 00:48:25.545
and awesome, but she would have gone off the
rails. I think it would have caused a lot of her--

00:48:25.545 --> 00:48:32.797
I don't think it would have been attractive on
her. It would be Keyleth as a nihilist. I don't know--

00:48:32.797 --> 00:48:34.848
TALIESIN: You would be an angry nine-year old.

00:48:34.848 --> 00:48:39.890
MARISHA: Yeah. She would have been like: What's it
all matter? Meh.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.265
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Somewhere in the darkest
timeline.

00:48:43.265 --> 00:48:45.972
(laughter)

00:48:45.972 --> 00:48:46.580
MATT: Thank you.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.770
CHRISTEN: Thank y'all. Thank you.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.441
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

00:48:51.441 --> 00:48:53.510
STEPHANIE: Hello. My name is Stephanie.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:54.801
CAST: Hi Stephanie.

00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:56.387
TALIESIN: Nice Chun-Li.

00:48:56.387 --> 00:48:58.790
MARISHA: Aww, you're so cute!

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.792
STEPHANIE: Don't make me blush, come on!

00:49:01.792 --> 00:49:04.040
(laughter)

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.409
STEPHANIE: All right, my question is for Brian,
but it could also be answered for all of you guys, too.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.240
MATT: Only for Brian.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.560
BRIAN: Are you in law enforcement?

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:22.394
STEPHANIE: Spoilers. This is spoilers, it's from
Thursday's episode. When Grog pulled out the Deck

00:49:22.394 --> 00:49:29.921
of Many Things, what was your reaction, since we
clearly saw Matt, Marisha and Taliesin's reactions

00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:30.610
on Twitch?

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:43.840
BRIAN: So I've known Travis for almost ten years,
and I know him so well. We'll hang out not doing

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:51.261
anything related to Critical Role, and the deck
comes up, I would say, every 20 minutes.

00:49:51.261 --> 00:49:53.091
(laughter)

00:49:53.091 --> 00:49:57.601
BRIAN: I'll be talking to Travis about football or
a movie or something, and then you'll start to see

00:49:57.601 --> 00:50:07.070
this drifting happen. Sometimes if Laura's there,
she'll say, "Are you thinking about the deck?"

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:17.170
He's obsessed with this deck thing. The battle
royale is one thing, I am really interested to see

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.877
what happens in the real game.

00:50:19.877 --> 00:50:24.160
TALIESIN: It's not that we're nervous about Grog
having the deck. If anything, it's that we're

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.389
nervous about Travis having the deck.

00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:33.761
BRIAN: That's exactly right. That's what terrifies
me. If you tell Travis, "There's a poisonous snake

00:50:33.761 --> 00:50:43.401
inside this thing of Red Bull," he will bite it in
half, drink all of the Red Bull, and not touch the

00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:48.330
snake and go, "Well, if I don't get poisoned--
it's 50/50. I could win, I could lose." He always

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:53.972
plays the odds and that's why the deck, he's so
obsessed with it. Because he goes, "It could

00:50:53.972 --> 00:50:58.738
either go perfectly, something could be great, we
could have a great weapon or something come out,

00:50:58.738 --> 00:51:06.991
or everybody dies." If everyone dies right in the
middle of Keyleth's, "We're gods-- we're dead!"

00:51:06.991 --> 00:51:11.670
because of the stupid deck. I can't wait to see
what happens. I hope it's a TPK.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:17.568
MATT: When I rolled the decks, I was like, "I'm
never putting any of this in a campaign! It ruins

00:51:17.568 --> 00:51:21.551
the narrative." Then I rolled it on a random
treasure table when they defeated Thordak. I was

00:51:21.551 --> 00:51:27.733
like (sighs), "Well, it's the smaller version of
the deck so it doesn't have the super world-ending

00:51:27.733 --> 00:51:37.479
cards. Still pretty awful. Usually it's Laura or
Percy that investigates the treasure hoard first.

00:51:37.479 --> 00:51:46.527
So at least I know a player with some intelligence
is going to find it." So that went well. He rushed

00:51:46.527 --> 00:51:51.470
there first and rolled so high I was like, "Well,
okay. Here we go!"

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:58.197
BRIAN: I'll tell you a funny behind-the-scenes
story that night with the deck. All of us near the

00:51:58.197 --> 00:52:05.560
control center where all the smart people sit,
they let me sit by them. When the deck thing

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.650
happened, one of the producers Eddie, who wears
headphones and is deep into the computer, but he

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.984
knows everything there is to know about D&amp;D. A lot
of us didn't know the deck was. A lot of us

00:52:15.984 --> 00:52:22.891
backstage were, "Why is everyone freaking out?"
Because Liam was going-- and then everyone else

00:52:22.891 --> 00:52:27.199
was just whatever. I was just sitting there and
then they were like, "Oh, is there a deck? Is

00:52:27.199 --> 00:52:29.969
there a whatever, you know?" Then everybody's
telling me it looks like it's actually going to

00:52:29.969 --> 00:52:34.431
come into the game. Eddie threw his headphones off
and was like--

00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:41.794
(laughter)

00:52:41.794 --> 00:52:43.489
TALIESIN: I can see that so clearly in my head.

00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:51.015
BRIAN: I Googled so fast. Then they have the list
of what each of the-- and I was like, "Okay, oh my

00:52:51.015 --> 00:52:56.720
god." My first thought was, "Travis!"

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.929
TALIESIN: I think the deck in the battle royale
was my fault, because every game, I distribute--

00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:10.950
we get a lot of mail. It's mostly in my room. I
live in it now. There's more mail in my room than

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:16.752
furniture. It's one of the reasons I don't
livestream very often anymore. I look like a hobo.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.088
BRIAN: He's like Scrooge McDuck, except with
envelopes.

00:53:18.088 --> 00:53:22.601
TALIESIN: Yeah, except it's just paper. I'm like,
"Ah! Papercuts! God!" I distribute a little of it

00:53:22.601 --> 00:53:28.820
every week, and that deck that he had, that is
what I had given him. I was like, "Here, you're

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:34.020
going to dig this!" and I gave him the deck with
the letter. It might not have been in his

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.450
consciousness if I hadn't handed him a physical
deck.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:42.949
MATT: Well, it's fine, because his use of the deck
in the battle royale was a safe place to use it

00:53:42.949 --> 00:53:48.499
and to learn that there are a lot of consequences.
Or not; he pulled the cards with no consequences!

00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:55.941
MARISHA: You sound like a begrudging father trying
his best to give a sex ed talk. Like, it was a

00:53:55.941 --> 00:53:58.758
safe place to learn the consequences.

00:53:58.758 --> 00:54:03.520
TALIESIN: So you lock the kid in his room with a
crate of scotch and open it an hour later, the

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:09.008
scotch is gone, and he's like, "I feel great!"
You're like, "That did not work!"

00:54:09.008 --> 00:54:13.660
MARISHA: Well, and the other crazy thing is
because he was like, "I pull five cards!" and I

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:22.091
was like, "What?" Matt and I were looking at the
rules, and in the book they don't state that there

00:54:22.091 --> 00:54:29.300
is a limit to how many cards you can draw in a
turn. So now I have this nightmarish image in my

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:36.971
head of Grog doing like a card flourish and 52
card pickup of the Deck of Many Things.

00:54:36.971 --> 00:54:40.051
MATT: Exandria goes (poof). Gone.

00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:45.461
TALIESIN: If you can't tell, we talk about this a
lot. This is a subject of conversation. I feel

00:54:45.461 --> 00:54:47.509
bad, we've actually held the line now. Sorry.

00:54:47.509 --> 00:54:49.614
STEPHANIE: Thank you so much.

00:54:49.614 --> 00:54:53.409
BRIAN: Thank you for addressing it to me and
making me feel like I have a purpose in this world.

00:54:53.409 --> 00:54:55.080
STEPHANIE: But you're awesome!

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.349
BRIAN: I'm just kidding, I know.

00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:58.502
TALIESIN: Don't encourage him.

00:54:58.502 --> 00:55:01.539
BRIAN: Look at this beard. I'm just kidding.

00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:03.845
TALIESIN: I meant to wake up and shave it this
morning, I feel really bad about it.

00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:06.290
BRIAN: You tried, but I had the deadbolt locked!
Go ahead!

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.651
MELISSA: Hello.

00:55:08.651 --> 00:55:09.908
BRIAN: Hey, what's your name?

00:55:09.908 --> 00:55:11.000
MELISSA: Hi, I'm Melissa.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.730
BRIAN: Hey, Melissa!

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:17.477
MELISSA: Hi! I'm a first-time GM for a Pathfinder
game.

00:55:17.477 --> 00:55:18.130
MATT: Awesome!

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:26.430
MELISSA: I've noticed how hard that was when I
first started as my very first game to GM. But I'm

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:36.538
also taking improv classes to get better at GMing.
I have a question for all you guys as professional

00:55:36.538 --> 00:55:51.111
actors. There's a long-form improv format created
by Mark Meer. It's like a long-form improvised D&amp;D

00:55:51.111 --> 00:55:57.729
format. Have you guys been interested in actually
doing something similar, like putting Dungeons &amp;

00:55:57.729 --> 00:56:02.950
Dragons on a stage rather than through a stream?

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:09.529
MATT: Well, it's funny that you mention that. Not
in a stream per se, but years ago -- there's a

00:56:09.529 --> 00:56:15.264
long-running show in Los Angeles called Dungeon
Master that was just that. Still going! A lot of

00:56:15.264 --> 00:56:19.070
our friends ran it and so a few of us would be
guests on it occasionally.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:22.997
TALIESIN: I guested a couple times on Dungeon
Master. Then there was a sci-fi spin off that we

00:56:22.997 --> 00:56:24.286
did for several years.

00:56:24.286 --> 00:56:29.212
MATT: Called Adventure! The three of us were all
cast members. We'd all-- every week was a

00:56:29.212 --> 00:56:33.540
different storyline, a continuation of last week's
storyline. We all, the cast, played different NPCs

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:38.200
with costumes and set pieces, and then five people
from the audience would be pulled up as player characters.

00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:41.020
TALIESIN: They would be in costume with character
sheets that they'd filled out, and they would play

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.032
through the game, and we would be the NPCs.

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:46.096
MARISHA: Yeah, and we would generally like get
them killed or something horrible.

00:56:46.096 --> 00:56:51.299
MATT: The characters, not the people! None 
of this is legally binding, you heard nothing.

00:56:51.299 --> 00:56:54.204
MARISHA: No one was harmed during the making of
Adventure.

00:56:54.204 --> 00:56:55.343
MATT: Erase the tape.

00:56:55.343 --> 00:57:01.906
TALIESIN: It was a pretty solid-- there was some
great stuff. You in the evil Disney World was one

00:57:01.906 --> 00:57:07.535
of my favorites. She played a psychotic, murderous
Tinkerbell with a baby in a bag that she would

00:57:07.535 --> 00:57:13.205
beat on the ground to get people's attention. It
was amazing. It was one of the best things I've

00:57:13.205 --> 00:57:19.784
ever seen in my-- it was so hard to keep my shit
together with you with a shank and the baby in a

00:57:19.784 --> 00:57:22.148
bag. The makeup smeared.

00:57:22.148 --> 00:57:23.986
MARISHA: Out of context, this sounds awful.

00:57:24.646 --> 00:57:27.183
TALIESIN: "Everybody smile!" Oh, it was so good.

00:57:27.183 --> 00:57:31.042
BRIAN: I'd pay five dollars extra a month to watch
that show.

00:57:31.042 --> 00:57:32.996
(laughter)

00:57:32.996 --> 00:57:34.552
TALIESIN: It was an amazing show.

00:57:34.552 --> 00:57:35.912
MARISHA: It was good! It was good fun.

00:57:35.912 --> 00:57:38.145
MATT: It was a lot of fun stuff.

00:57:38.145 --> 00:57:40.385
TALIESIN: Is Dungeon Master still running?

00:57:40.385 --> 00:57:42.739
MATT: Yeah, Dungeon Master is still running.

00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:46.834
MARISHA: Yeah, so if you're ever in LA, you can
check out a Dungeon Master show.

00:57:46.834 --> 00:57:49.692
TALIESIN: They put stuff on YouTube every now and
then, too.

00:57:49.692 --> 00:57:51.633
MELISSA: Very cool. Thank you guys!

00:57:51.633 --> 00:57:54.595
BRIAN: Okay, I think this is our last question.

00:57:54.595 --> 00:57:56.529
(groaning)

00:57:56.529 --> 00:58:00.060
BRIAN: Well, I don't know! Normally, there's
people that hold up a sign and then they give you

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.876
an angry look.

00:58:00.876 --> 00:58:01.707
TALIESIN: They haven't done that yet.

00:58:02.687 --> 00:58:11.661
BRIAN: Maybe we just keep going. All right, this
guy's waiting. Sorry guys, we tried, go ahead.

00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:15.064
BRENDAN: Hi, I'm Brendan.

00:58:15.064 --> 00:58:17.183
MATT: What's your question?

00:58:17.183 --> 00:58:23.036
BRENDAN: I was going to ask what your favorite
character arcs are, besides your own? So not the

00:58:23.036 --> 00:58:28.899
Briarwoods, the Aramente, or the Chroma Conclave.
For Brian, your favorite character arc.

00:58:28.899 --> 00:58:33.116
TALIESIN: Fire Plane. Fire Plane for me.

00:58:33.116 --> 00:58:39.923
MARISHA: Yeah. All the Raven Queen stuff. It was
cool.

00:58:43.723 --> 00:58:48.155
MATT: I was actually going to say that, because he
was planning to go paladin of Sarenrae. Through a

00:58:48.155 --> 00:58:57.225
chance resurrection ritual, the death of his
sister, and a spontaneous pledge he made as that

00:58:57.225 --> 00:59:03.435
process led his path entirely different to instead
pursue the path of the Raven Queen. This is the

00:59:03.435 --> 00:59:07.893
reason I love D&amp;D, you can't plan for that. A
couple of die rolls and a spontaneous character

00:59:07.893 --> 00:59:13.596
choices and an entire character's planned destiny
that you thought they had goes in another

00:59:13.596 --> 00:59:18.396
direction, and now you're following that element.
I thought was a really cool switch.

00:59:19.146 --> 00:59:27.649
BRIAN: The end of Scanlan's arc before he left, I
think. It made Sam and I closer as friends because

00:59:27.649 --> 00:59:32.664
of my past. We got to have a lot of conversations
about something that he didn't really have any

00:59:32.664 --> 00:59:40.855
experience in because he's a green baby with no--
he doesn't live on the edge like me. I would say

00:59:40.855 --> 00:59:48.446
that arc really was powerful and that speech he
made at the end, I still think about that as

00:59:48.446 --> 00:59:54.786
character work and as a piece of acting that was
insane, in my opinion.

00:59:54.786 --> 00:59:56.394
TALIESIN: Yeah, definitely. We were not prepared.

00:59:56.394 --> 00:59:59.695
BRIAN: Thank you very much. All right, one more!

00:59:59.695 --> 01:00:01.463
MARISHA: Make it good!

01:00:03.093 --> 01:00:10.979
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is somewhat for Matt and
also for Marisha and Taliesin. Matt, as a DM whose

01:00:10.979 --> 01:00:16.546
characters went 180 degrees, I had to create a
combat encounter map off the top of my head, what

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:22.595
is your favorite DM recovery moment of going like,
"Oh shit, I had not planned for this. What can I

01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:28.756
do?" For you guys, what is your favorite moment of
you knowing you screwed up plans somewhat and

01:00:28.756 --> 01:00:30.475
watching him stumble?

01:00:32.945 --> 01:00:40.416
TALIESIN: We can't tell. He doesn't flinch. He's
like that guy who can hold his hand over a candle

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:42.435
and maintain eye contact.

01:00:42.435 --> 01:00:48.255
MARISHA: Yeah, we never see him stumble. We never
know if we're doing something off the rails, where

01:00:48.255 --> 01:00:49.484
we're just going and shit.

01:00:49.484 --> 01:00:52.416
TALIESIN: It didn't even occur to me that that pub
crawl was going to be out of his-- like he was

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:57.043
going to have to pull that out of nowhere until
like an hour and a half into it. I'm like, "Oh god."

01:00:57.043 --> 01:01:03.145
MARISHA: I'm still pretty partial to Vex and
Keyleth and Laura and Marisha being like, "Screw

01:01:03.145 --> 01:01:07.824
you guys!" when you guys didn't want us to go off
in the Underdark in the very beginning.

01:01:07.824 --> 01:01:09.083
TALIESIN: Oh, that was great! On the carpet!

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:13.620
MARISHA: Then we went and found Clarota, which I
don't think we were supposed to find him that

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:18.365
soon, or ever, potentially. Finding Clarota, that
was cool.

01:01:18.365 --> 01:01:22.193
MATT: Yeah, that was fun. That was definitely one
of the big off-throws, like, "Okay, well, this is

01:01:22.193 --> 01:01:25.165
an NPC that they probably weren't going to meet,
or if they were going to meet, it was going to be

01:01:25.165 --> 01:01:28.816
much later and it was probably just going to be a
battle. But they convinced to join them. They now

01:01:28.816 --> 01:01:38.786
have an actual arcane magic-using mindflayer in
their party. Sure." Actually, I've thought about

01:01:38.786 --> 01:01:45.091
this recently, I forgot about it, but when they
were in the Moonbrush in the Feywild, I was not

01:01:45.091 --> 01:01:47.214
expecting you guys to side with the werewolves.

01:01:48.684 --> 01:01:49.444
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

01:01:49.444 --> 01:01:54.534
MATT: You guys came in and fought and slaughtered
the pixies. That was fully improvised. That was

01:01:54.534 --> 01:02:00.659
fully like, "Okay, let's do this. You guys are
going to kill a bunch of pixies against the trees.

01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:06.604
MARISHA: They were mean pixies.

01:02:06.604 --> 01:02:11.025
MATT: Oh yeah, well pixies are generally not-- you
hear pixies like, "Aww, that's so cute, they're beautiful!"

01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:11.569
TALIESIN: No!

01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:17.627
MATT: They're also kind of dicks. Most things that
are fey are. They are selfish little entities that

01:02:17.627 --> 01:02:19.665
expect things to work however they want.

01:02:19.665 --> 01:02:24.974
MARISHA: And Vox Machina is also a selfish entity
that gets very defensive and takes things personally.

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:32.244
MATT: When an unstoppable force meets an immovable
wall! Those are a few examples there, definitely.

01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:33.296
Good question!

01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:36.223
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I just want to give you this!

01:02:36.223 --> 01:02:38.294
ALL: Okay!

01:02:38.294 --> 01:02:41.404
TALIESIN: Hand it to Brian because it's always
funnier.

01:02:52.964 --> 01:03:01.265
BRIAN: This is a subpoena. Yeah, we have a
signing, so bring everything to the signing. Or

01:03:01.265 --> 01:03:09.020
give it to Ginny if you're not coming to the
signing.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.553
MARISHA: That's Ginny! You'll see her, she'll
know.

01:03:12.553 --> 01:03:14.296
TALIESIN: She knows where we are at all times.

01:03:14.296 --> 01:03:21.075
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Marisha, before you go, please
cast regenerate on Tyriok, give him his arm back please.

01:03:21.075 --> 01:03:22.513
MARISHA: Oh, he's fine!

01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:24.674
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Come on, he's right there!

01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:29.559
MARISHA: He's fine! It gives him character.

01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:31.695
TALIESIN: He wears it well.

01:03:32.565 --> 01:03:34.033
MATT: It wasn't his drawing arm.

01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:40.324
TALIESIN: If anything, I think it makes his maps a
little better. He's trying harder. Oh god, I'm so

01:03:40.324 --> 01:03:44.075
mean, I know. I feel bad about that arm, I do.

01:03:44.075 --> 01:03:46.414
MARISHA: I do feel a little bad. I should probably
fix that.

01:03:46.414 --> 01:03:48.246
TALIESIN: I could build him something.

01:03:48.246 --> 01:03:49.567
MARISHA: You could make him a mechanical arm!

01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:51.090
TALIESIN: I'll make him a robot arm.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.263
MARISHA: That's way cooler than a real arm.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:57.114
MATT: This is your other legacy; firearms and
prosthetics. That's what Percy has done in Exandria.

01:03:57.134 --> 01:04:01.195
TALIESIN: I've made really nice roads. It's true.
The roads in Whitestone are great now.

01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:03.753
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I can't believe you made heated
roads.

01:04:03.753 --> 01:04:06.046
MATT: Well, they're starting to. It's going to
take a while.

01:04:06.046 --> 01:04:09.002
TALIESIN: It's going to take a while, but we've
already got several of the main throughways. It's great.

01:04:09.002 --> 01:04:10.204
MATT: Thank you guys so much for coming!

01:04:10.204 --> 01:04:13.465
BRIAN: Thank you guys for coming, thank you for
waiting, see you at the signing! There is also a

01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:18.765
signing tomorrow. Check your local listings. We
love you guys.

01:04:18.765 --> 01:04:21.698
MATT: We are signing tomorrow at 12:30 to 2:15.

01:04:21.698 --> 01:04:23.557
BRIAN: 12:30 to 2:15.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:26.442
MARISHA: So if you don't see us now, we'll see you
then. Thanks, you guys!

01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:30.495
MATT: Oh god, these chairs!

01:04:30.495 --> 01:05:17.868
