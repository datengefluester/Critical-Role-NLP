NOTE Paragraph

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:05.949
WIL: Yeah.

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:12.118
LIAM: [intones Thus Sprach Zarathustra]

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:15.850
WIL: I feel like it should be sadder when it gets
to me.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.489
LIAM: [intones sad trombone]

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:23.281
WIL: (laughs) Okay, so here's what's happening. We
just wrapped on Tabletop, and we're overlapping

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:28.698
with Critical Role a little bit. I asked them all
not to die, and Travis had this super great idea.

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:32.332
TRAVIS: We're calling in the big guns. We're
calling in the deity-level powers.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:39.872
WIL: This is how desperate everybody is in the
party. They've called in <i>me</i> to save the day.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.684
TRAVIS: We're calling in overwatch. We're calling
for an airstrike.

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:45.040
WIL: What we're going to do, and I don't know why
I'm whispering this--

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.921
TRAVIS: Because you have to on these things. You
have to whisper.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.340
WIL: So we're going to go in and I'm going to
touch Matt's table.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.551
TRAVIS: Lay hands.

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.259
WIL: Lay my hands all over that table.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.763
LIAM: There's also a large goliath in the center
of the board. If you could rub his head with your

00:00:57.763 --> 00:00:58.840
fingers a little bit.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.311
TRAVIS: Yeah, touch the Mister Clean dome.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.639
WIL: Yeah. Because the thing is that I told them
not to die because if you guys die, I'm going to

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:11.098
get blamed for it. Because every time one of you
jerks rolls badly, Critters go bananas at me!

00:01:11.098 --> 00:01:14.062
TRAVIS: You're kind of like the Hulk. We're not
going to try and control the juju, we're just

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.651
going to aim the juju.

00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.521
WIL: That's my secret: I always roll terribly.

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:22.392
LIAM: Let's go put your secret sauce on stuff,
Wil. Come on. There she is.

00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:23.661
LAURA: Oh, this is happening.

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:24.875
LIAM: Yeah.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.042
WIL: That's really interesting!

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.684
MATT: Yeah, guys, it's great!

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:33.895
TRAVIS: I feel better already! Fuck
sage! You're the best thing ever!

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:41.525
WIL: Have a good time tonight! Don't fucking die!
Just don't die!

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:42.784
ASHLEY: (yells)

00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:44.617
LAURA: No, no, no!

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:51.963
WIL: It is, in a non-cursing-you sense, it is
genuinely good to see you.

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:53.346
MATT: Always.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.925
WIL: Have a good game tonight. Don't kill my
friends.

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:57.453
MATT: I'm going to try not to.

00:01:57.453 --> 00:02:00.034
TRAVIS: I thank you. A thousand gold shall be
transferred to you.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.213
WIL: I like gold! I can use it to buy stuff!

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:03.394
TRAVIS: Six gold and--

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.684
WIL: Five gold and a party!

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:08.645
LAURA: Woo! Five gold and a party!
