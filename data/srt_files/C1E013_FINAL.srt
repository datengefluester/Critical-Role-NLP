00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,963
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to the next episode
of Critical Role! This week, we have a full party.

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:12,177
We'll be continuing just after the climactic
battle with the twisted beholder, K'varn. We're

3
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:14,321
going to go ahead and play a couple of videos here
while we're waiting for the rest of the party

4
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:17,977
members to settle in, so we'll be back here in
just a few minutes. Sit tight and we'll get this

5
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,557
party started. We have some fun announcements,
some cool gifts that came in we'll be opening

6
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:25,663
towards the end of the session today, but we'll go
into those details shortly, so see you

7
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,720
in a little bit.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:01:35,843
[dramatic music]

9
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:43,793
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

10
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:51,137
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

11
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:55,427
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

12
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,027
(record scratch) Wait.

13
00:01:57,027 --> 00:02:03,999
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

14
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,003
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

15
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,807
Also ale.

16
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:15,353
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

17
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:21,720
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:29,883
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

19
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:36,539
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience

20
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,660
cost him dearly.

21
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,627
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

22
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:53,711
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

23
00:02:53,711 --> 00:03:01,744
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

24
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:07,106
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

25
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:14,282
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

26
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:20,339
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

27
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,050
Also ale!

28
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,457
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

29
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:32,324
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

30
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:34,313
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

31
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:40,940
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

32
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,875
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

33
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:52,415
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

34
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:58,291
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

35
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:04,045
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

36
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:08,408
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

37
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:13,762
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

38
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:21,145
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

39
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:27,163
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

40
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:32,073
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

41
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:38,467
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

42
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:44,492
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

43
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:50,137
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

44
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:56,916
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

45
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:02,994
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

46
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,796
will ever return.

47
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:10,079
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

48
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,390
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

49
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:25,264
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

50
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:32,201
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

51
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:38,067
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

52
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:42,545
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

53
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:49,031
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

54
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:55,019
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

55
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,937
would stand in their way.

56
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:02,596
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

57
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:08,890
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

58
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:15,200
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

59
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,577
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

60
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:24,679
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

61
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:31,869
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

62
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:40,128
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

63
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:46,431
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

64
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:52,125
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

65
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:58,415
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

66
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:03,277
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

67
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:09,742
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

68
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:15,003
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

69
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,925
life of service and devotion.

70
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:24,581
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

71
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:30,751
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

72
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:34,271
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

73
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:40,740
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

74
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,978
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

75
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:53,549
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

76
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:58,800
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could, bringing him

77
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,999
back to life.

78
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:08,587
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends,

79
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:15,277
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

80
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:22,403
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

81
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:27,285
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

82
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:32,728
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

83
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,284
called the Broken Howl.

84
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:40,490
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her
morningstar in the other, this time,

85
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,850
Pike is ready.

86
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:49,870
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

87
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,132
eye on you.

88
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:56,687
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

89
00:08:56,687 --> 00:09:00,497
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

90
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:06,573
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

91
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:12,044
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr.

92
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:18,376
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world and honed his skills

93
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:21,212
as a bard extraordinaire.

94
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:25,675
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

95
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:31,353
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

96
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:37,745
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

97
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,668
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

98
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:49,125
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

99
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:54,424
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

100
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:56,222
gnome, Pike.

101
00:09:56,222 --> 00:10:01,752
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

102
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,531
and makes the females swoon.

103
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:13,108
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

104
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,914
located in the heart of Draconia.

105
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:21,387
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

106
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:26,360
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

107
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,453
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

108
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:36,831
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

109
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:41,206
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

110
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:47,390
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

111
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,277
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

112
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,745
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

113
00:10:55,745 --> 00:11:00,490
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

114
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,900
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

115
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,954
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

116
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:14,118
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

117
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:18,682
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

118
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:23,284
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

119
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:28,437
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

120
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:34,283
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

121
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:39,637
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

122
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:45,422
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

123
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:51,049
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

124
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:58,685
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

125
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:03,153
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

126
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:10,256
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

127
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:15,245
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

128
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:21,922
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

129
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:27,620
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

130
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,154
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

131
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:39,283
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

132
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,220
on the open road.

133
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,504
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

134
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:52,472
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

135
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:59,107
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

136
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:09,104
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

137
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:13,032
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

138
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:20,041
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

139
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:26,767
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

140
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:31,845
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than makes

141
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,742
up the difference.

142
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:39,372
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

143
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:46,661
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

144
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:51,741
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

145
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:57,379
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world

146
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,401
were each other.

147
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:04,859
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

148
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:11,562
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

149
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:18,331
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

150
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:22,009
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

151
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:30,106
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

152
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:33,622
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

153
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:40,866
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

154
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:47,775
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

155
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:52,451
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

156
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:58,627
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

157
00:14:58,627 --> 00:16:04,788
[dramatic music]

158
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:08,599
MATT: Hello, guys! Welcome back. Thank you for
your patience. We have the whole group, finally

159
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:13,545
seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that
is 13th-level Los Angeles traffic.

160
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,227
(cheering)

161
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:16,818
ZAC: What's up, internet? I've got a quick
announcement.

162
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:17,956
MATT: Yes.

163
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:26,116
ZAC: Guys, we have a big giveaway today, when we
get to 3,300 subscribers. I think we're 50 away or

164
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:33,162
around 48, something like that. When we get to
3,300, we're giving away a dice box, a signed

165
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:40,563
t-shirt, a starter set, and a signed Player's
Handbook all in one box for a lucky winner, so if

166
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:44,516
you guys get those subscribers rolling in, that's
what helps pay for this show and pay for the

167
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:51,113
entire channel as a whole, so get on that! And we
wanted to say thank you to Aaron's Books in

168
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:54,904
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for sending us this
stuff to give away to you guys.

169
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:58,562
(cheering)

170
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,370
MATT: Seriously guys, seriously, that was so cool
of you to send that out there, and we want to say,

171
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,846
happy sixth graduation, Aaron, congrats to you,
well done.

172
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,527
(cheering)

173
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,574
ZAC: Aaron's a little young to be running a
bookstore. That's all I have to say.

174
00:17:09,574 --> 00:17:13,627
MATT: I consider that a very fine entrepreneurial
position. You're getting started young, good man.

175
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,856
ZAC: So guys, enjoy the game.

176
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:18,738
MATT: Thank you so much, and thank you again,
Aaron and Aaron's books. That's awesome, guys.

177
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,541
TRAVIS: Who was that strange masked man just now?

178
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,642
MATT: I don't know, it's so weird. Okay, so a
couple quick things. First off, thank you guys for

179
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,210
coming back and watching. Last week we had a few
members away, so we had a fun little mini-game

180
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,241
with a few folks, some who had played before, some
who hadn't, and it turned out very interestingly.

181
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:36,441
I hope my DM's tips were helpful for some folks
out there. There's been some great feedback, and

182
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:40,958
hopefully we'll do more things like that in the
future for off-days. So, thanks to you. Welcome

183
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,002
back, we're getting back into the main story line.
Couple other quick things I wanted to mention:

184
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:52,278
first off a big shout-out, birthday shout-out to
Kit Buss, our fantastic artist for the show.

185
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:54,152
(cheering)

186
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:55,474
TRAVIS: Happy Birthday, Kit!

187
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,539
ORION: We love you, Kit.

188
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:57,857
ASHLEY: Happy birthday!

189
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:04,250
MATT: She's awesome, she's amazing, and I've seen
a couple little previews of the next piece of art

190
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,369
she's been working on and it looks pretty awesome.
I think you guys are going to dig it. So she's not

191
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:11,746
done, when she's finished drinking her birthday
shots, then I think we'll hopefully see that soon.

192
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,147
(laughs) Awesome, thank you so much, Kit!

193
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,415
MARISHA: Yes, shots first, then draw.

194
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:21,173
MATT: Exactly, it's priorities! Also, anyone have
any announcements they want to mention before we

195
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,436
start the game? Any upcoming stuff?

196
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,848
TRAVIS: The Justice League thing!

197
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:33,213
MATT: That's true, yeah! DC Kids on Youtube just
released their new Super Friends animated series

198
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,356
that both me and Travis are in.

199
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,817
ORION: Who are you? Who do you guys play?

200
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,025
MATT: Well, you play Lex Luthor.

201
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,379
TRAVIS: Lex Luthor, and you play Superman.

202
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,607
ORION: Son of a bitch!

203
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,226
SAM: Interesting choice.

204
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,792
TALIESIN: You can feel the tension.

205
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,093
MATT: It's a really, really cute show, it's a lot
of fun, it's very much a playback to the classic

206
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,198
Super Friends cartoon, that kind of comedic
atmosphere. You should check it out.

207
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,656
SAM: You're Superman?

208
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:53,536
MATT: Yeah.

209
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,291
SAM: (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this?

210
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,371
MATT: Yeah, it gets a little weird around episode
three. I don't think DC's happy with how we

211
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,871
treated the license for that one.

212
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:02,066
(laughter)

213
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,311
TRAVIS: That's the best.

214
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:09,170
MATT: That's every character I do now. Matthew
Mercer, reading for Superman: (croaking noise)

215
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,311
Also, if anyone else has any other announcements
they want to mention?

216
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:15,264
MARISHA AND ORION: Yeah!

217
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,369
MARISHA: You go first.

218
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:22,320
ORION: Whatchamacallit, a few weeks ago me and
Matthew wore these really cool shirts with the

219
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,924
vermilion bird from Rubrum, which is in Type-0,
the Final Fantasy that we're both in! That shirt

220
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:34,467
was made from Greven, g-r-e-v-e-n, at Redbubble,
and we wanted to thank him for those shirts, along

221
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:42,106
with this awesome Final Fantasy shirt, made by
August8913, where she did this super cool, it says

222
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:46,659
Nine on the back, his says Trey. Thank you guys,
for the really cool shirts.

223
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,596
TRAVIS: Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie
jam-slam.

224
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:59,629
MARISHA: I'm going to be at Lock and Load this
weekend in Seattle, which is the War Machine

225
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:02,546
Hordes con for Privateer Press.

226
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:03,523
TRAVIS: Really?

227
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:08,941
MARISHA: Yeah! It's awesome, I'm going to be
dressed up in my Scar costume. It's going to be

228
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,793
awesome, I'm going to be doing a big
transformation with Espionage. Yeah, and we're

229
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:17,717
actually going to be pushing the stream; they're
going to be streaming it and Geek&Sundry is going

230
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:24,907
to be hosting the Lock and Load stream, so tune in
and watch me prance around at

231
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,632
Lock and Load in Seattle.

232
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:29,070
TALIESIN: Those are impressive shoes to prance in,
by the way.

233
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,528
MARISHA: Yeah, some intense stripper heels, yeah.

234
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:35,284
ORION: Who'd you play?

235
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,281
MATT: Kreoss.

236
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:38,431
ORION: You were Kreoss, by the way, War Machine
Tactics, Matthew Mercer is Kreoss.

237
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,934
MATT: Kreoss, Asphyxius, couple other guys.

238
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,547
ORION: Yeah, yeah, check it out.

239
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:42,805
MATT: It's fun, it's on Steam.

240
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:43,906
LIAM: Asphyxius?

241
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,021
MATT: Asphysius is the character's name, lich lord
Asphyxius, he's bad in town.

242
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:49,847
MARISHA: I'm Haley and Deneghra and Fiora.

243
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,103
LAURA: We're going to be at MetroCon next
weekend.

244
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,928
MATT: Awesome! MetroCon next weekend.

245
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:55,268
TRAVIS: (sings) In Tampa.

246
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,704
LAURA: (sings) In Tampa, Florida.

247
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:57,864
TRAVIS: Tampa, Florida.

248
00:20:57,864 --> 00:21:00,954
MATT: Okay. Real fast, before we get to that, I
will be, for those who are near--

249
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:02,354
MARISHA: You already did it?

250
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:03,917
TRAVIS: How many did we have to go?

251
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:04,912
ZAC: 50.

252
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:06,237
LAURA: Ridiculous.

253
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:07,703
MARISHA: 50 subscribers.

254
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:09,188
MATT: Well, we already hit the mark!

255
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,411
MARISHA: Don't we normally hit that in, like, a
show?

256
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,748
MATT: That works, you guys are amazing!

257
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,378
ASHLEY: Yes, that's awesome!

258
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,817
ORION: Thank you, everyone!

259
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,320
MATT: I'll finish my last announcement, then we'll
go to that.

260
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,606
ZAC: I'm going to go ahead and start the
giveaway.

261
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:20,590
MATT: Go, start the giveaway!

262
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,673
TRAVIS: When is the next giveaway?

263
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:28,078
ZAC: We're going to do-- Those pictures already
exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah,

264
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,576
so we're going to do this. We're going to do a
whole other set of these when

265
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:32,026
we get to the next 50.

266
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,966
MARISHA: Oh, a whole other set? There's another
one?

267
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:37,022
ZAC: Technically, we have four sets.

268
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,382
LIAM: See you in five minutes.

269
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:44,112
MATT: So we have four sets of those to give away.
Every 50 subscribers another set goes out, guys,

270
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,493
so that's amazing.

271
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,196
ORION: I could have Sam fart on this for you, if
you want.

272
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:50,679
SAM: Again? Already done, friend, already done.

273
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,768
MATT: Whoa. Okay, there we go. (laughs)

274
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,425
TRAVIS: The world just ended.

275
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:05,591
MATT: That was close. I just rolled a one on my
camera save. Final announcement before we get

276
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,841
to the game, for those who are-- (shushing
noises)

277
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,494
ORION: Sorry. Okay.

278
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:15,229
MATT: Can't all talk at once. Also, this weekend
I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio, at Colossal Con along

279
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:19,365
with such great folks as Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve
Blum, other fun greats--

280
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,886
TRAVIS: Is that at the water park?

281
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:21,704
MATT: Yeah.

282
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:22,723
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

283
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:28,451
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, because water parks are
totally sanitary. Hot tub's going to be great.

284
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,189
TRAVIS: The dysentery afterwards is--

285
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,954
ZAC: Flyingsquid63 is the winner.

286
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:35,474
ALL: Flyingsquid63!

287
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:38,848
MATT: You are the winner of the first set.
Congratulations, that's awesome.

288
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,199
ASHLEY: It's an awesome name.

289
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:43,270
MARISHA: Oh look, and it's green. You're winning
green speckled dice, like squid colors.

290
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,020
MATT: There you go, that worked out well, very
Cthulhu-ian.

291
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,474
MARISHA: I'm justifying. Shut up, Liam!

292
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:50,451
(laughter)

293
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:55,153
MATT: Well awesome, so we hit our next 50, we'll
do another giveaway, we have three more of those

294
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:59,676
packages to give out, guys, so hopefully keep that
up. All right, anything else or should we get back

295
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,001
into the chaos?

296
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,121
MARISHA: Yeah.

297
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,171
ASHLEY: I'm scared!

298
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,238
MATT: You should be.

299
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:05,375
ASHLEY: I really am.

300
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:09,743
SAM: We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all
fine.

301
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:12,377
MATT: Where we left off.

302
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:15,757
ORION: I forgot to ask you something before the
game, it's fine.

303
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:19,492
MATT: It's okay. The party, as they ventured deep
into the Underdark beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains

304
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:26,336
in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, they sought and
discovered Lady Kima of Vord, a folk hero, a

305
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:30,597
paladin of Bahamut who had been captured and
tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it.

306
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:35,149
After saving her, they discovered that there was
an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil

307
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:42,640
brewing beneath the surface. There was an
illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'voril deeper

308
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,497
within these cavern structures, and currently the
Elder Brain of the colony was under the control of

309
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:56,038
an entity known as K'Varn, they came to find out was
a self-mutilated and advanced beholder, who had

310
00:23:56,104 --> 00:24:02,635
come into contact with a dark artifact known as
the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many

311
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:08,117
many, many many, like hundreds of years ago by the
god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his

312
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:13,588
avatars. Somehow it found its way to this
beholder, and gave it enough power to where it

313
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:18,944
gained complete dominion over this colony and
these caverns as a whole. The party fought their

314
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,134
way through and made a few allies, including the
ousted mind flayer, Clarota, seeking to return to

315
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:27,554
his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as
well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save.

316
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:35,667
Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they
used their magic carpet to completely go around

317
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:41,345
the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the
temple in the center of the city, and using a

318
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:47,133
polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs), cascading
down hundreds upon hundreds of feet, through the

319
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:52,750
glass structure on top, managed to break their way
into the temple, after which a very dangerous

320
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,809
battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A
number of very close calls. I posted the stats for

321
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,316
them after the fight, if any of you guys got a
chance to see it. They made saving throws where it

322
00:25:03,383 --> 00:25:07,054
counted, or we'd have a lot more party members
that'd be permanently dead. But they managed to

323
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:12,650
take him out; using Tiberius's Telekinesis, they
tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder

324
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:20,903
fell to the ground, unmoving and finally killed,
as opposed to its undead form, and that's where we

325
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:25,576
begin. As you guys all sit there looking around
yourselves, adrenaline still pumping in your ears,

326
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,560
the flow of blood.

327
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,641
ORION: Pike--

328
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,370
ASHLEY: That's me! What do you need?

329
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,149
ORION: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing
that can reverse stone?

330
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:35,159
ASHLEY: Yes, I do.

331
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,305
ORION: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we
stay, do we leave, or do we-- what do you? There

332
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:46,902
are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at
us right now, and they don't like me very much, by

333
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:47,748
the way--

334
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:48,998
LAURA: We should get out of here!

335
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:56,612
MATT: At which point, Clarota turns to you and
says, "You. Bring her." Points to Kima, who is

336
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,647
still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul.

337
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:01,307
ASHLEY: To carry her?

338
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:06,744
MATT: "Stay but a moment; I will talk to them."

339
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,445
SAM: Talk to the hive.

340
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:14,648
ORION: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned,
or still stoned?

341
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:19,598
MARISHA: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone
Kima, we talk about what we should

342
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,044
do with the Horn.

343
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:24,435
ORION: This is exactly what has to do with the
Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps

344
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:31,430
half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo
her legs from stone, I don't want her to be

345
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,425
mobile. I want to ask her--

346
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,572
ASHLEY: I don't know if I--

347
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:41,439
SAM: If I may, very quickly, are you with us,
Tiberius?

348
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:42,833
ORION: We will discuss that when we get out of
here.

349
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:46,925
SAM: Because you disappeared for like, the whole
fight. Are you with us?

350
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,288
ORION: I am with you.

351
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:50,727
SAM: Are you going to disappear again?

352
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:54,302
ORION: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to
begin with!

353
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:57,972
SAM: Well, you weren't there when we needed you
the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.

354
00:26:57,972 --> 00:27:02,459
ORION: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be fighting that damn thing.

355
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,845
SAM: What on earth are you talking about?

356
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:04,787
ORION: Silence.

357
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,858
(laughter)

358
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,557
SAM: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.

359
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:12,552
ORION: Counterspell.

360
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:16,722
SAM: Do I have a will save?

361
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,157
ORION: No, you're done, you're quiet.

362
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,989
MATT: That low enough level? No, unfortunately.

363
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:26,674
ORION: The idea, which I will share-- we don't
have time to do that--

364
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:29,232
SAM: I turn him into a goat.

365
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,026
ORION: He has to say that, it doesn't work.

366
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,331
MATT: I know that.

367
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,848
(laughter)

368
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:42,768
ORION: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she
wants the horn, if there is any other reason but

369
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:44,645
to destroy it, we have to--

370
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,066
SAM: Okay, then I'll Banish him.

371
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,217
LAURA: (gasps)

372
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:50,180
ASHLEY: How about-- well, hold on.

373
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,170
TALIESIN: He can't stop it, he can't talk!

374
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,016
MATT: Also requires verbal casting.

375
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:57,086
SAM: I have to touch him, right?

376
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,432
MATT: You also have to be able to speak.

377
00:27:58,432 --> 00:27:59,985
SAM: Fuck!

378
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:04,239
MATT: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is
tapping you and mouthing words angrily.

379
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:12,075
ORION: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy
it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I

380
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:13,893
believe you want to destroy it, yes?

381
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:15,493
MARISHA: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to
take it back up to the surface

382
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,482
if it's that terrible?

383
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:21,060
ORION: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that
his name?

384
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,264
MATT: Orcus, yes.

385
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:24,548
ORION: This thing is no good at all.

386
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:26,112
MARISHA: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?

387
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:28,078
ORION: Where is some lava? I would much like to do
that.

388
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,441
MARISHA: Well, we're around lava, right?

389
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,453
TRAVIS: We were.

390
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:31,591
LAURA: We're not around lava now.

391
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:36,140
TALIESIN: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it
to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why

392
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,035
don't we have a conversation with her?

393
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:44,489
ORION: But she wanted to take it back to Emon.
That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.

394
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,377
TALIESIN: Let's get some information first.

395
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:47,820
ORION: I dispel Silence.

396
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,906
MATT: Okay.

397
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:50,159
TALIESIN: Let's get some information, let's figure
out--

398
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,564
SAM: Oh hi, hi there.

399
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,746
ORION: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point
across.

400
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,400
ASHLEY: I can un-stone her.

401
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,182
TALIESIN: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she
can take it from us.

402
00:28:58,182 --> 00:29:01,959
ASHLEY: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we
might need to rest.

403
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,324
TALIESIN: If something horrible happens, we're
going to run anyway at this point.

404
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:08,741
MATT: I assume you guys have come down in here
then.

405
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:12,196
ORION: I'm staying up, can I not--

406
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,161
SAM: Then how did we have this whole conversation?

407
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,645
ORION: Oh, then I'd be down there.

408
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:21,304
LAURA: I was planning on staying up. I'm not
leaving Trinket up there.

409
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,043
MATT: Okay. Good.

410
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:26,904
TALIESIN: Why don't we find out what happens next?
And if we have to, you can teleport us out of

411
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:28,118
here, correct?

412
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:29,692
ORION: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.

413
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:36,003
MARISHA: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we
have before something happens next?

414
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:42,894
MATT: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two
stone doorways on each side of the temple shift

415
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:49,531
open and you notice three mind flayers glide in
from the side of the room.

416
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:50,992
LAURA: I notch my arrow.

417
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:55,546
ORION: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

418
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,187
MATT: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures.

419
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,876
ALL: No! No.

420
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:02,283
MATT: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up
like this.

421
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:06,406
TRAVIS: I'm grappled, so.

422
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:09,151
MATT: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you
can try to break from the grapple if you want to

423
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,351
roll an athletics check.

424
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:19,374
TRAVIS: (laughs) I would like to, just because
these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven.

425
00:30:19,374 --> 00:30:21,870
MATT: Nope, you're still held against the bars.

426
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,476
TALIESIN: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in
Little China.

427
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,468
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.

428
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:30,358
MATT: Still not enough, unfortunately.

429
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:35,437
ASHLEY: Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep
going!

430
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:41,651
MATT: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are
hovering forward, looking around the room, taking

431
00:30:41,651 --> 00:30:45,507
in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the
center, they're all just moving towards the Elder

432
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:52,885
Brain. And they make their way up towards it,
looking very intent and very frightened at the

433
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:57,302
prospect of what maybe has happened in this room.
As they all approach, you can see that low, dull,

434
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:03,545
kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still
pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost

435
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:08,456
like it's coming to more life. You can hear the
cage rattling of the various entities that are

436
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:14,349
still inside, like the one that's still grappling
Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is

437
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:18,342
still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell,
is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating

438
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:23,882
on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still
freshly tumbling from the side.

439
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,801
ORION: And it's at the halfway point between where
she is and where I'm standing.

440
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:28,829
MATT: So right here?

441
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:29,751
ORION: Yeah, right there.

442
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,144
MATT: Not this big, of course.

443
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:33,165
ORION: It's really heavy, guys!

444
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:39,426
MATT: As they all move towards the center,
Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls

445
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:47,763
back the hood, and steps towards the other mind
flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the

446
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:48,916
point here.

447
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,113
ASHLEY: (whispers) Can you instill an
inspiration?

448
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:55,382
SAM: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his
own.

449
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:59,156
ORION: "Don't do anything." I'm saying this on the
ears.

450
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:09,826
MATT: The three illithid look over and notice
Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of

451
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:17,731
silence as they just look at each other. At which
point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of

452
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:21,829
the group and looks at them, looks at all of you
and lowers his head a little bit as the mind

453
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:29,415
flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over
and pulls the cap from the back of his head,

454
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:37,282
removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and
if you think you've ever seen an entity with

455
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:44,235
tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his
awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of

456
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:51,727
joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out
to the rest of you and bows a head for a second.

457
00:32:51,727 --> 00:33:01,149
I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to
all make--

458
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:04,256
TRAVIS: Tiberius, if he fucks us.

459
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,019
SAM: I think he's about to.

460
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,314
MATT: Intelligence saving throws.

461
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:15,632
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck
yes! Intelligence saving throws?

462
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,440
MATT: Intelligence saving throws.

463
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,416
TRAVIS: Thank god I rolled high.

464
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,184
ORION: Natural 20.

465
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:27,092
TRAVIS: (laughs) I get a negative two modifier,
that's such bullshit.

466
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:29,072
(laughter)

467
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:30,424
MATT: Not very wise, there, Grog.

468
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:31,822
TRAVIS: 17.

469
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:33,696
SAM: Is this a charm?

470
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,860
MATT: This would be-- no, it would not be.

471
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,938
MARISHA: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that
the deal?

472
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,462
ORION: It's 23.

473
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:45,917
MATT: 23, 20. Scanlan?

474
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:46,952
SAM: 12.

475
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:48,285
MATT: 12. Pike?

476
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:49,467
LAURA: She needs better dice.

477
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,060
ASHLEY: I rolled a six.

478
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,047
MATT: Okay. Grog?

479
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:55,545
ASHLEY: Six total. (laughs)

480
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:57,063
TRAVIS: Oh. 17.

481
00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:06,079
MATT: Okay! So. Currently, all the mind flayers at
once, including Clarota, angrily lash out with a

482
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,575
Mind Blast. You feel your brains all of a sudden
fill with searing, horrible pain. Some of you

483
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:16,379
manage to shrug it off, but the rest of you find
your bodies locking in place. All right, everyone

484
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,076
who failed their save, which would be-- Keyleth,
what'd you roll?

485
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:20,774
MARISHA: You didn't have me roll.

486
00:34:20,774 --> 00:34:23,467
MATT: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're
in the blast there. You're still

487
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,132
an earth elemental.

488
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:31,168
MARISHA: I thought I was immune to this kind of
stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.

489
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:38,093
MATT: Not good? All right, that'll be 22 points of
psychic damage to Grog, to Pike.

490
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:39,768
TRAVIS: I passed, right?

491
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:40,973
MATT: No, you passed this. You're fine.

492
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:42,606
LAURA: Teleport us out of here!

493
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:46,724
ORION: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was
trying to say earlier!

494
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:54,260
MATT: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are
actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well.

495
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,274
The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast,
but at this point in time you can now see that

496
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:07,951
this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with
its people, your purpose serving its end, you're

497
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:10,374
about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire
city.

498
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,852
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!

499
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:13,051
MATT: Let's roll initiative, guys.

500
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:15,110
MARISHA: We should've gotten out of here!

501
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,558
TRAVIS: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker!
Fuck.

502
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:27,264
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20?

503
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:28,428
LAURA: 21.

504
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,705
MARISHA: 21, as well.

505
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,975
MATT: Nice. 20 to 15?

506
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:36,256
ORION: 19.

507
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:37,808
TALIESIN: 17.

508
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:39,754
ASHLEY: 16.

509
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:46,100
MATT: All right, 15 to ten?

510
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,482
LIAM: 14.

511
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,413
SAM: 13.

512
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,465
MATT: All right, Grog?

513
00:35:52,465 --> 00:36:00,367
TRAVIS: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking
fighting brains and mind flayers again.

514
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,852
LAURA: We're all going to die.

515
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,925
MARISHA: Okay, wait, you guys run.

516
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:07,333
MATT: Vex, you're up first.

517
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,683
MARISHA: I can start bringing down the palace.

518
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:13,807
LAURA: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run,
we're stuck, because there's

519
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:15,359
only one flying carpet.

520
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,021
TRAVIS: Tiberius has got something for us, right?

521
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:23,092
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the
Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the

522
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,870
Elder Brain.

523
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,074
MATT: Okay.

524
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:30,629
ORION: Yes! I like that idea!

525
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:33,621
MARISHA: I'm going to start bringing down the
temple! Are we okay with that?

526
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:35,317
TRAVIS: We're still in it.

527
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:37,054
ORION: Not while we're still in it.

528
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:39,538
MARISHA: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm
sure.

529
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:41,719
TRAVIS: Or it could happen really quick.

530
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:48,206
MATT: As you guys do notice-- you guys are
beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly

531
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:52,176
coming out from the outside, and you hear what
seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in

532
00:36:52,176 --> 00:37:00,430
the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns
down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for

533
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,624
the attack.

534
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:02,798
LAURA: 19?

535
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:04,530
MATT: 19 will hit, yes.

536
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,071
SAM: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.

537
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:11,396
MATT: What, the teleportation one?

538
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,079
ORION: We'll talk about it later. Plan B, it's ten
minutes.

539
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,675
MATT: One minute.

540
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:18,071
ORION: Sure!

541
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,895
MATT: Pretty sure it's one minute

542
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,448
MARISHA: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll
distract?

543
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,850
ORION: No, don't look at it! You said one minute,
that's the DM, DM is god.

544
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:31,114
LAURA: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of
Thorns?

545
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:34,768
MATT: I thought it was.

546
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,769
TRAVIS: If someone asks you if you're a god--

547
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,411
ALL: You say yes.

548
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:44,752
TRAVIS: You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste
your time.

549
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:46,331
MATT: Spellcasting time: one minute.

550
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,320
ORION: Oh, yes, I'm so glad I'm wrong.

551
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,838
LAURA: 39 on the first hit.

552
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,226
ORION: How many of us are down there?

553
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:57,864
ASHLEY: 39?! Yes!

554
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:59,607
MARISHA: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.

555
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,272
TALIESIN: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head
that direction.

556
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:03,115
LAURA: And then 18 for the second.

557
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:08,104
MATT: Okay, so you release the first Hail of
Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole--

558
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:12,590
LAURA: And anything within five feet takes damage,
as well.

559
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,578
MATT: That'll be all four of them. How much damage
do they take?

560
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:20,607
LAURA: They take the same amount unless they
make--

561
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:23,509
MATT: Unless they make a what? Do they have a
saving throw against it?

562
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:28,705
LAURA: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a
saving throw.

563
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:37,031
MATT: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it,
two of them don't.

564
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:41,290
MARISHA: Look, look, I do double damage to objects
and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good

565
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,011
at tearing shit down.

566
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:47,010
ORION: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right
thing to do!

567
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,202
MARISHA: That's why I'm not talking about
fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!

568
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,694
MATT: All right, so Clarota and the one nearest to
it get behind a pillar for a second and

569
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:57,624
manage to reduce the damage a bit, but the other
two are completely pierced all over their bodies

570
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,093
where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn
arrows exploded all over them and the Elder Brain.

571
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:07,956
The pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in
your mind, like the actual presence of the Elder

572
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:17,220
Brain is starting to yell out in pain. You feel
it's hardy but hurting. I mean, it's very hefty,

573
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,567
it's a large chunk of matter, so god knows how
long it would take to take that one down, but it's

574
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:26,037
definitely-- (laughs) it hurt. It's not happy with
that. Do you want to move at all or do you want to

575
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:27,092
stay where you are?

576
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:28,563
LAURA: I want to do my second attack.

577
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:30,279
MATT: Yeah, that's right!

578
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:33,445
LAURA: Yeah. 15?

579
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:37,606
MATT: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually
fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow

580
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:41,169
splinters against it. Stay where you are?

581
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:43,960
LAURA: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up
at the top.

582
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,906
MATT: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay,
that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

583
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:49,661
SAM: Keyleth!

584
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:55,180
MARISHA: I think my best use-- I agree we need to
get out of here, but I'm going to--

585
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,996
MATT: You have shadows moving in from the two open
doorways on each side right now.

586
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:04,065
MARISHA: What, so the Elder Brain-- is this a
wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?

587
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:08,573
MATT: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that
houses the Elder Brain at the center.

588
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:14,033
MARISHA: Here's what I can do. I can start
breaking the well, or I can start blocking

589
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,273
entrances. I can start pulling down--

590
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:18,633
TRAVIS: That one, the second one.

591
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,161
TALIESIN: The second one.

592
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:21,260
MARISHA: The second one?

593
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,501
TRAVIS: The second one, close the doorway.

594
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,241
MARISHA: All right. Who's coming in from where?

595
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:25,648
MATT: This is one doorway. That's the other.

596
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:30,298
TRAVIS: I thought he said it was big.

597
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:37,186
MARISHA: All right, I am going to-- I can make it
there, right? That's 35 feet?

598
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:42,118
MATT: That-- ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah
no, that's longer than 35 feet.

599
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:44,907
LAURA: Just bull rush and tear down the well.

600
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,171
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to
do.

601
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,908
MATT: What do you want to do?

602
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:50,414
MARISHA: All right, all right!

603
00:40:50,476 --> 00:40:53,160
MATT: Just letting you know, just putting this
into perspective, here: you're fighting four

604
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,864
illithid in the room. You have a city swarming on
you right now.

605
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:58,384
LAURA: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder
Brain.

606
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:04,269
MARISHA: All right. I am taking down the doors.

607
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:07,856
MATT: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a
spell?

608
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:12,965
MARISHA: No, I'm going to start-- can I bull rush,
not necessarily right next to the door but like

609
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:19,794
right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into
the wall and siege monster this.

610
00:41:19,794 --> 00:41:21,609
MATT: What's the movement speed of the earth
elemental?

611
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:22,672
MARISHA: 35 feet.

612
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:25,273
MATT: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through
stone as well?

613
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:30,558
MARISHA: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move
through stone I think I can move 60 feet!

614
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:36,673
MATT: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually
shift into the stonework of the flooring itself

615
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:40,886
and coast through, popping up right out there.
That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see

616
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:47,665
there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small--
like an inclined pathway that you can see four

617
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:51,690
illithid making their way up right now, with some
large looming stomping sounds

618
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,036
coming up behind them.

619
00:41:53,036 --> 00:42:00,262
MARISHA: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth
to take up the door, and then I just go

620
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:03,004
(deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.

621
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:07,578
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or
attacks, depending on how many--

622
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:08,639
MARISHA: Slam, I guess.

623
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,540
MATT: Yeah.

624
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,374
LAURA: Get it, Keyleth.

625
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,660
(cheering)

626
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,838
MARISHA: 26!

627
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:16,561
MATT: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that.
Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra

628
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,158
siege damage against structures, don't you?

629
00:42:18,158 --> 00:42:19,648
MARISHA: Correct. Double damage.

630
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:34,543
So (laughs) okay. So does full damage,
plus five, so that's 21-- 42 points of damage.

631
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:35,807
ASHLEY: Yes!

632
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:39,648
MATT: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure,
which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old

633
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:44,983
structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean
design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You

634
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:49,266
take both of your earth elemental fists and slam
them into the side. As you do, the structure gives

635
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:55,311
way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around
you. You can feel the stones raining onto you.

636
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:59,703
Because of your proximity, you take four points of
impact damage.

637
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:05,077
MARISHA: I like it! It feels good! This is what I
bathe in!

638
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:12,610
MATT: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a
good 15-foot pile of stonework now

639
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,210
blocking that entranceway.

640
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,746
MARISHA: 15-foot pile?

641
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:21,997
MATT: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the
stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a

642
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:24,584
section of the wall that is collapsed down.

643
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:28,152
MARISHA: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right,
that's my turn.

644
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:32,263
MATT: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do
levitate.

645
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,549
TRAVIS: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they
don't?

646
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:38,818
MATT: All right, Tiberius, you're up.

647
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:40,493
ORION: Yeah, okay--

648
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,684
MATT: You can also see forms swarming through the
other doorway over there.

649
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:43,820
LAURA: Teleport us!

650
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,208
ORION: This isn't good.

651
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,805
LAURA: Fly us! Get us out.

652
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:50,765
ORION: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away
from me, right?

653
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:51,739
MATT: Yeah.

654
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:52,830
ORION: I'm right next to him!

655
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,512
MATT: Yep.

656
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:54,435
ORION: Oh!

657
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:55,554
TRAVIS: Beam us out, Scotty.

658
00:43:55,554 --> 00:44:05,375
ORION: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.

659
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:08,145
SAM: (laughs) Bye, Tiberius!

660
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,050
(laughter)

661
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:17,764
ORION: I redact that, actually. Is it possible--
I'm at least standing next to him, right?

662
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:18,819
MATT: You are.

663
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:21,914
ORION: I don't have to use a move action right
now. I can, like, look at him.

664
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:23,207
SAM: I leap!

665
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:32,701
ORION: Okay, can I give him-- can I take off my
Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?

666
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:36,972
MATT: No, I'm pretty sure-- if the item says
"attunement" on it, you have to spend a short rest

667
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:39,174
attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of
them does.

668
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:41,128
ORION: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to
the thing yet.

669
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:42,657
SAM: To what?

670
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:45,396
MATT: Right, but your Ioun stone-- you mean take
it from him?

671
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:46,432
ORION: Yeah!

672
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:48,248
MATT: You would have to attune it to yourself in
order to use it.

673
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:49,431
ORION: How long does it take?

674
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:50,665
MATT: It takes a short rest.

675
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:55,881
ORION: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a
very bad way.

676
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:59,623
MATT: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't
blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you

677
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:03,404
have probably more and more swarming from
underneath the temple, probably over at some

678
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,777
point, from what you've seen of the temple
structure.

679
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:19,841
ORION: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the
Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.

680
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:21,153
MATT: Okay.

681
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:23,138
ORION: Because my Telekinesis is still going.

682
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,773
MATT: That's true.

683
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:30,227
ORION: I can't do anything else without dropping
this thing because as soon as I do anything else,

684
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,984
I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.

685
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:39,724
MATT: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and
roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis.

686
00:45:39,724 --> 00:45:41,490
TRAVIS: Oh god.

687
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,085
ORION: What am I adding?

688
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:46,875
MATT: You're adding your modifier, which I think
is five.

689
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,691
ORION: Oh, 23.

690
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:59,244
MATT: As you focus intensely, you feel that the
Horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is

691
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:03,814
far too powerful for your meager magic to have any
sort of effect on its physical structure.

692
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:05,273
ORION: I thought so.

693
00:46:05,273 --> 00:46:09,783
MATT: As you focus your arcane intent on crushing
it, you feel almost like the back of your brain

694
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:14,703
begins to crawl with cold energy, and if you could
hear-- if you could hear laughter come from

695
00:46:14,703 --> 00:46:17,619
something that is inanimate, you're hearing it
coming from the Horn right now.

696
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:19,295
TRAVIS: Fuck that horn.

697
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:21,342
MATT: That's your action.

698
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:23,709
ORION: I'm going to--

699
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:29,666
LAURA: Float it into the Bag of Holding!

700
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:35,571
ORION: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos
because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt

701
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:36,646
me, right?

702
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:37,716
MATT: Not currently, no.

703
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:39,215
ORION: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.

704
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:40,938
LIAM: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.

705
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:44,002
MATT: 30, that's as far as you can get.

706
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:47,838
ORION: Well, I can run.

707
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,136
MATT: You already used your action to
Telekinesis.

708
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:52,629
ORION: Oh. That's stupid.

709
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:54,829
MATT: That's how it works.

710
00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:00,470
ORION: "Hey, Percy!" (laughs) That's my turn,
that's all I can do. And I

711
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,538
still maintain the thing.

712
00:47:02,538 --> 00:47:08,473
MATT: Okay. That brings us-- end of Tiberius's
turn, to Percy.

713
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:16,964
TALIESIN: I'm going to start flying straight up,
and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to

714
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:27,669
take... two shots with the Pepperbox at the big
brain.

715
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:32,915
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice.

716
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:43,413
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a
21? That's 21.

717
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:45,410
MATT: 21 does hit.

718
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,776
TALIESIN: And should I do both hits?

719
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,569
MATT: Yeah, roll both.

720
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:55,155
TALIESIN: Oh, and-- no, that's right, I don't
critical at 19?

721
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,218
MATT: No.

722
00:47:56,218 --> 00:47:59,539
TALIESIN: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And
that hits, so both hit, and they're both with

723
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:07,016
Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't
pulled my dice out yet. There we go.

724
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:09,560
LIAM: Come on, gunslinger!

725
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,526
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.

726
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,376
MATT: All righty.

727
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:20,399
TALIESIN: And 17 points of damage.

728
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:23,433
MATT: All right, gotcha.

729
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:28,939
TALIESIN: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points
of fire damage.

730
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:34,935
MATT: Okay, good. All right, so as you (gunshot)
turn over the barrel of your weapon, fire again,

731
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:39,172
the second one bursting into flame as it hits the
top of the Elder Brain, you can see both bullets

732
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:44,890
sink into the flesh. There's no impact; they just
seem to be absorbed in by it. The flame one, you

733
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:50,213
see a jet of flame go from the inside and the
flesh of the actual large Elder Brain quivers for

734
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:57,101
a moment. You hear another shrieking, angry pain
growl in your minds just by the proximity of this

735
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:04,802
entity. You don't see it doing too much to it, but
it's definitely hurting it. That ends your turn?

736
00:49:04,802 --> 00:49:09,667
MARISHA: Things can hurt really bad and not do
that much damage.

737
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:16,932
MATT: Clarota spins and comes up behind you--

738
00:49:16,932 --> 00:49:19,150
LAURA: Don't be a dick.

739
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:22,642
TRAVIS: Remember our days watching Saved by the
Bell together?

740
00:49:22,642 --> 00:49:29,677
MATT: You are stunned currently, so it gets
advantage on that. So that's 24. All right, so

741
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:33,454
Clarota's tentacles wrap around your head--

742
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:34,868
(gasping)

743
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:36,072
TRAVIS: Whose?

744
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:38,681
MATT: You immediately take 15 points of psychic
damage and you are currently grappled.

745
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:40,640
SAM: And stunned.

746
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,890
MATT: Yes.

747
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:47,905
SAM: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and
stunned!

748
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:52,637
MATT: All right, that comes to Pike! Pike, you're
stunned currently, mind still reeling from the

749
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:55,477
pain; go ahead and make an intelligence saving
throw.

750
00:49:55,477 --> 00:49:58,338
ASHLEY: Ugh, okay.

751
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:00,988
TRAVIS: We're just trying to stay alive.

752
00:50:00,988 --> 00:50:07,143
ASHLEY: I just rolled a one.

753
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:12,984
MATT: Your physical form is still unable to pull
yourself out of that continuous psychic pain,

754
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:18,599
you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind
out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up.

755
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,592
LIAM: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm
going to-- where's the thingie, do we have a

756
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:24,610
thingie here?

757
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,527
ASHLEY: What do you need?

758
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:26,809
LIAM: The light.

759
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:27,925
TRAVIS: Yeah.

760
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:35,014
LIAM: All right, great. How's this work? Like
that. If I can run right between Pike and this

761
00:50:35,014 --> 00:50:40,634
little brain jerk right here, does that get me
within five feet of Elder Brain if I'm there? I

762
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:43,026
can't tell from the structure.

763
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:45,689
MATT: You can rush there, you would have to get up
onto here.

764
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:52,293
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I
don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I

765
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:56,450
don't know how that affects the number of attacks
I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many

766
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:58,996
times as I can, standing on top of this thing.

767
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,565
MATT: All right, got it.

768
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,798
LIAM: Where's the meteorite die?

769
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:04,629
ORION: Fuck you, couch!

770
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:07,435
LIAM: Using my poison dagger.

771
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:09,069
TRAVIS: Prison shank that thing.

772
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,394
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his
shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the

773
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:12,722
more accurate phrase.

774
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:17,975
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for attack
twice.

775
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:21,246
TRAVIS: Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do
it?

776
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:27,787
MATT: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of
opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out

777
00:51:27,787 --> 00:51:29,537
and strike at you with its claws.

778
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:30,868
LIAM: Okay.

779
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:34,564
MATT: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the
side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter

780
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:35,901
(clunks) on the ground.

781
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,841
LIAM: Do I get two or three attacks?

782
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:39,645
MATT: You get three if you use your bonus to
attack.

783
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:47,304
LIAM: First one misses. Second one is-- oh wait,
the first was a 17, is that--

784
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:48,607
LAURA: That doesn't miss.

785
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,211
LIAM: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm
standing--

786
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:55,859
MATT: Total 17? That would still-- it doesn't
miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a

787
00:51:55,859 --> 00:52:01,908
psychic field that's defending it, and your blade
is held at bay by the protective sphere.

788
00:52:01,908 --> 00:52:05,404
LIAM: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is
26.

789
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,203
MATT: Okay, that does hit.

790
00:52:07,203 --> 00:52:16,939
LIAM: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten,
because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.

791
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:17,934
MATT: No.

792
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,834
LIAM: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?

793
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:25,152
MATT: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a
17.

794
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:31,158
LIAM: So that was that, and then the third attack
I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.

795
00:52:31,158 --> 00:52:34,700
MATT: 14. The second one strikes through, the
poison tries to pulse through but once again it

796
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,776
resists the impact; the third dagger comes down
and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a

797
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:42,389
blast of psychic energy from the inside of the
containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that

798
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:50,380
(boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected
entirely. That ends your turn. The other three

799
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,238
illithids now go.

800
00:52:52,238 --> 00:52:54,980
ASHLEY: I wish we had inspiration.

801
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,685
ORION: Isn't there a rope still hanging from
there? Throw the damn rope!

802
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:02,660
LAURA: You can climb it.

803
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,441
LIAM: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang
there.

804
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:07,624
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.

805
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:13,701
MATT: This one's also going to turn around, reach
forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to

806
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:15,442
wrap around Pike's head--

807
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,453
TRAVIS: Don't you touch my friend.

808
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:19,357
MATT: That's going to be a 20?

809
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:21,303
TRAVIS: A natural 20?

810
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:28,429
MATT: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and
take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage.

811
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,069
LIAM: It was a good run, folks.

812
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,600
MARISHA: What happened?

813
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,957
LAURA: He rolled a 20.

814
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:35,318
ASHLEY: So he rolled a 20.

815
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:40,402
MATT: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned
currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage

816
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:46,579
as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself,
these cold tentacles wrap across the front of

817
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:51,930
your field of vision, and you can feel this weird,
toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to

818
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:56,964
push towards the back of your skull. This one--

819
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:59,265
ASHLEY: That's it, that's all she wrote.

820
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:04,148
MATT: This one here is going to--

821
00:54:04,148 --> 00:54:06,472
LAURA: He's going to try to eat her brain!

822
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:10,827
MATT: Tiberius, that is a 15 versus AC.

823
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:11,875
ORION: Nope!

824
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:12,948
MATT: What's your AC?

825
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:14,001
ORION: 17, man!

826
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:19,675
MATT: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic
carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and

827
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:23,630
the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just
underneath and manage to avoid the

828
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:32,630
attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's
going to go ahead and look up towards the magic

829
00:54:32,692 --> 00:54:44,097
carpet that's taking off and-- here we go. Oh,
within ten feet? No, you're too far away. So

830
00:54:44,097 --> 00:54:49,470
instead it's going to go for you on top of the
Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an

831
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,909
intelligence saving throw, Vax.

832
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:55,249
LIAM: 20, natural 20.

833
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:56,385
MATT: Natural 20!

834
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:58,488
SAM: Needed that.

835
00:54:58,488 --> 00:55:00,183
LAURA: That's not to Matt, that's to the 
little brains.

836
00:55:00,183 --> 00:55:01,555
LIAM: The brains, the brains.

837
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:03,831
MARISHA: Fuck you, little brains.

838
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:07,636
MATT: So you feel a similar blast of screaming
energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's

839
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:12,471
more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug
it off in your mind and angrily look down at this

840
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:21,316
weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and
attempts to blast you again from the opposite

841
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:24,456
side. Make another intelligence saving throw.

842
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:25,447
LIAM: 19.

843
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:30,994
MATT: 19! Once again you feel from the back of
your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug

844
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,027
it off looking over this way.

845
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:34,608
LIAM: (jeering) I'm smart!

846
00:55:34,608 --> 00:55:36,330
(laughter)

847
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:41,497
MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.

848
00:55:41,497 --> 00:55:44,270
SAM: I'm grappled and stunned.

849
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,067
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving
throw.

850
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:49,267
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

851
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:50,775
(cheering)

852
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:55,715
ORION: Boom!

853
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:59,416
MATT: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're
currently grappled by the entity.

854
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:02,415
LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: You're so smart!

855
00:56:02,415 --> 00:56:07,649
TRAVIS: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go.
Table's getting hot.

856
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:09,249
LIAM: Aren't you inspired?

857
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:12,887
MATT: And then also make an intelligence saving
throw.

858
00:56:12,887 --> 00:56:15,733
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things
on me.

859
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,538
LIAM: Just say 20.

860
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:21,107
SAM: Seven. (laughs) Plus two.

861
00:56:21,107 --> 00:56:23,116
LIAM: Big nine.

862
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:25,539
MATT: Okay.

863
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,594
LIAM: I said big nine.

864
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,922
ASHLEY: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean
something.

865
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:31,518
TALIESIN: I think a nine is a big six.

866
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:34,225
MARISHA: The 20 carries over one, right?

867
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,925
(laughter)

868
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,166
TRAVIS: Residual?

869
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:38,837
MARISHA: You take the one and you carry it over.

870
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:40,625
TRAVIS: Natural 20 residual.

871
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:45,307
LIAM: I personally can't wait until we roll new
characters next show.

872
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:46,374
LAURA: No.

873
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:47,699
MARISHA: Shut up!

874
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:53,670
MATT: Unfortunately, you're still stunned.

875
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:56,364
SAM: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off--

876
00:56:56,364 --> 00:57:00,305
MATT: You resisted the mind effect, but the
tentacles on your head are now locking your brain

877
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:04,436
in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back
in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth

878
00:57:04,597 --> 00:57:07,578
begin to push against the outside of your head.
Grog?

879
00:57:07,578 --> 00:57:09,428
TRAVIS: I've got to break my grapple, right?

880
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,103
MATT: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics
check.

881
00:57:12,103 --> 00:57:15,376
TRAVIS: One.

882
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:17,056
MATT: A natural one?

883
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:18,025
SAM: This guy.

884
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,578
MATT: A natural one; it rolled a four!

885
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:24,781
ORION: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.

886
00:57:24,781 --> 00:57:26,667
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter.

887
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:31,260
MATT: Okay. So it's still holding you in place;
you have your axe you picked up off the ground

888
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,725
with your chain of returning; you can't physically
move from your position

889
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:36,072
as it's holding you there.

890
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:37,566
TRAVIS: The axe is across the room, remember?

891
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:39,797
MATT: Well, no, you threw it over here and
retrieved it at the end of the battle.

892
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,528
TRAVIS: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.

893
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:42,867
ASHLEY: (frustrated noise)

894
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:44,097
MARISHA: The fuck!

895
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:45,308
MATT: So what do you want to do?

896
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:46,685
LAURA: You could attack with your chain.

897
00:57:46,685 --> 00:57:47,718
TRAVIS: I can attack with the chain?

898
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:49,894
MATT: You have your axe with your chain of
returning, you just can't move, but you can still

899
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:51,121
throw if you want to.

900
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,028
ORION: Oh, awesome.

901
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:55,400
MARISHA: Can you chop the dude's arms off?

902
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,680
TRAVIS: I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think
I can be like--

903
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,347
ASHLEY: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles
or whatever?

904
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:04,991
TRAVIS: I was going to try and save you.

905
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:07,058
ASHLEY: Well. That's far.

906
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:08,587
TRAVIS: Can I reach the illithid-- it's far?

907
00:58:08,587 --> 00:58:13,473
MATT: Well, you can throw to either of them right
now. They're both bent over gnome heads,

908
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:14,560
they're bigger--

909
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,439
TRAVIS: Where's Scanlan?

910
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:16,410
ASHLEY: Why the gnomes?

911
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,874
MATT: He's here, and that's Pike.

912
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:19,149
ASHLEY: Why the gnome hate?

913
00:58:19,149 --> 00:58:20,748
MARISHA: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.

914
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,215
MATT: You guys were right there.

915
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:24,739
TRAVIS: All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and
throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan.

916
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,277
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

917
00:58:26,277 --> 00:58:27,488
ASHLEY: Tasty gnome.

918
00:58:27,488 --> 00:58:33,052
LIAM: All the fans who implied that Matt went
light on us the last game--

919
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:34,410
TRAVIS: 22?

920
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,567
MATT: 22, definitely hits, 
go ahead and roll damage.

921
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:45,422
TRAVIS: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit
balls. 14.

922
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:52,182
MATT: 14 points of damage, all right. That one,
you throw the axe, it slams into the shoulder of the

923
00:58:52,182 --> 00:58:56,571
illithid that's grabbing on to him. You see it
look up at you angrily and a large portion of its

924
00:58:56,632 --> 00:59:02,229
chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from
the wound, but it's still holding tight right now.

925
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:05,278
I think that's going to end your turn.

926
00:59:05,278 --> 00:59:06,381
TRAVIS: No, I'm done.

927
00:59:06,381 --> 00:59:07,340
MATT: Do you want to pull your axe back?

928
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,321
TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to.

929
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:09,937
MATT: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make
your check.

930
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:14,814
TRAVIS: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the
thing. What do I roll? A 12?

931
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:19,187
MATT: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was
a d12.

932
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:20,121
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

933
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:21,033
(laughter)

934
00:59:21,033 --> 00:59:21,891
TRAVIS: 18.

935
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:25,762
MATT: So you pull on the chain of returning and it
yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it

936
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,731
in midair, preparing for the next round.

937
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,997
TRAVIS: (laughs) The 12 was a one.

938
00:59:28,997 --> 00:59:30,423
(laughter)

939
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:33,177
MATT: All right, first round of combat over. Let's
roll better, guys. This is looking really dire.

940
00:59:33,177 --> 00:59:34,672
Vex, you're up.

941
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:38,111
ASHLEY: Get it.

942
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,167
SAM: Save everyone.

943
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:42,672
MATT: You're up at the top, you have a clear view
of everyone.

944
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:45,517
MARISHA: That's true, you're the only one with a
bird's-eye view.

945
00:59:45,517 --> 00:59:47,297
SAM: Just run. Save yourself.

946
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:53,432
MATT: As it is, these two illithids look kind of
hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks

947
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:56,272
really rough, both of these guys haven't been
damaged yet but they have low hit points.

948
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:58,904
SAM: Save yourself, start a new race of people.

949
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:03,330
LAURA: I am going to attack--

950
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,814
SAM: Hunter's Mark!

951
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:10,424
LAURA: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my
brother just died.

952
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:12,844
LIAM: I fainted.

953
01:00:12,844 --> 01:00:16,851
LAURA: On the one attacking Scanlan.

954
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:22,640
TALIESIN: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking
Scanlan.

955
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,176
MATT: Oh right, sorry.

956
01:00:25,176 --> 01:00:27,278
(laughter)

957
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:30,914
TRAVIS: What did he do?

958
01:00:30,914 --> 01:00:32,523
MATT: In the confusion--

959
01:00:32,523 --> 01:00:35,699
SAM: (shrieking) Help!

960
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,534
ORION: Friendly fire!

961
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:39,549
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

962
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:40,975
LAURA: 14?

963
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:44,399
MATT: 14 unfortunately does--

964
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:46,570
ASHLEY: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?

965
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:49,256
MATT: You're stunned.

966
01:00:49,256 --> 01:00:51,401
ASHLEY: But can't I just do it just because?

967
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:52,792
MATT: No, unfortunately.

968
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:54,295
MARISHA: Once, just this once, please?

969
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:55,374
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

970
01:00:55,374 --> 01:00:58,085
LAURA: But he's bent over and I've got a
bird's-eye view of him.

971
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:01,547
MATT: You know what? He is grappling and he is
right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you

972
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:03,421
advantage on that attack. Roll again.

973
01:01:03,421 --> 01:01:05,029
LAURA: Yes! So I just roll again?

974
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,043
MATT: Roll again. Take whatever it is.

975
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:09,213
LAURA: 22!

976
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:14,308
MATT: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a
stationary position, completely engulfing, and you

977
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:15,955
have such a great view from above.

978
01:01:15,955 --> 01:01:22,088
LAURA: Right? 11 points of damage?

979
01:01:22,088 --> 01:01:24,781
MATT: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark
damage?

980
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:25,991
LAURA: No, I did not.

981
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:26,941
MATT: Don't forget Hunter's Mark.

982
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:30,884
LAURA: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for
Hunter's Mark.

983
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:32,168
ASHLEY: 14 total?

984
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:34,221
MATT: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike.

985
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:41,213
LAURA: Okay. On my second one, should I just try
to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm

986
01:01:41,213 --> 01:01:48,484
going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?

987
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:54,664
MATT: 18. Okay! So both strikes (whoosh). Go ahead
and roll for damage.

988
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:59,747
LAURA: 16 plus-- 19.

989
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:05,868
MATT: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one
embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with

990
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:11,462
the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota
stares up at you with this beaming angry look on

991
01:02:11,462 --> 01:02:17,053
his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one
that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you

992
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:20,981
bring down and release and it pierces the side of
its face, gashing through and embedding itself in

993
01:02:20,981 --> 01:02:26,726
the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking
really rough, but he's still holding taut. This

994
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:32,583
horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a
familiar voice saying, "You've all done your work.

995
01:02:32,788 --> 01:02:35,400
"Now it's time to feast!"

996
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,539
SAM: (gasps) He turned on us!

997
01:02:37,539 --> 01:02:40,229
LAURA: I knew he was going to do that!

998
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:41,996
SAM: What? None of us knew that!

999
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:45,163
LAURA: I totally knew he was going to do that.

1000
01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:46,568
MATT: All right, that ends your turn; Keyleth,
you're up.

1001
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:49,781
TRAVIS: I don't trust Clarota.
I don't trust Clarota.
I don't trust Clarota.

1002
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:51,556
(laughter)

1003
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,570
ASHLEY: Every week.

1004
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,663
TRAVIS: Every week!

1005
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:54,768
SAM: You know who would help us right now?

1006
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:56,520
LAURA: Kima would help us, but she's stone.

1007
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,621
SAM: Can we make her not stone?

1008
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:02,429
ASHLEY: We can make her not stone, except we
didn't get a chance to.

1009
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:05,078
LIAM: If we live, we're in store for so much
I-told-you-so.

1010
01:03:05,078 --> 01:03:06,841
(laughter)

1011
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:08,495
LIAM: It's a big if.

1012
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:13,154
SAM: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to
deal with that.

1013
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:16,162
TRAVIS: Who's up?

1014
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:26,207
MARISHA: I can make, I'm going to-- aw, crap. I'm
going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and

1015
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,495
I'm going to break the well that's holding the
Elder Brain.

1016
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:31,002
ASHLEY: Get it!

1017
01:03:31,002 --> 01:03:34,575
MATT: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over
here?

1018
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:37,300
LIAM: No, not there!

1019
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,171
MATT: Right there?

1020
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:42,225
MARISHA: Not where I might hurt Vax.

1021
01:03:42,225 --> 01:03:43,780
SAM: Well, that's anywhere.

1022
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,999
LAURA: Just do the other side!

1023
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:48,443
MARISHA: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo
off it.

1024
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:50,481
MATT: So what are you doing on the well, you're
just grabbing it?

1025
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,932
MARISHA: Can I? Can I flip?

1026
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,620
MATT: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are
you doing?

1027
01:03:54,620 --> 01:04:01,989
MARISHA: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to
just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill

1028
01:04:01,989 --> 01:04:03,733
out the brains.

1029
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,708
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the
side

1030
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,242
MARISHA: Bust the side of it open.

1031
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:09,114
ASHLEY: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain
juice.

1032
01:04:09,114 --> 01:04:22,420
MARISHA: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary
rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add-- so plus--

1033
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,105
sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?

1034
01:04:25,105 --> 01:04:27,715
MATT: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're
not attacking the brain, you're attacking the

1035
01:04:27,715 --> 01:04:30,681
stonework. You can feel there is some psychic
resistance, but because you're not attacking the

1036
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:35,230
brain directly, your fist slams into it, making
purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage

1037
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,350
against the stone.

1038
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,795
TRAVIS: Come on!

1039
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:39,236
MATT: Double damage on this.

1040
01:04:39,236 --> 01:04:40,503
ASHLEY: Big damage!

1041
01:04:40,503 --> 01:04:43,092
MARISHA: 20 damage.

1042
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:44,063
TRAVIS: Yes!

1043
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:47,849
MATT: 20 damage. The side of the stonework
crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself

1044
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:52,344
seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but
it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance,

1045
01:04:52,344 --> 01:05:00,029
but the whole side here to here is now just open
entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass

1046
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:04,763
of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid
brains that have slowly congealed into one large

1047
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:09,673
brain structure as now you can see the underneath
area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring

1048
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,286
out, down the side of the structure.

1049
01:05:12,286 --> 01:05:14,975
MARISHA: Hope they have flood insurance.

1050
01:05:14,975 --> 01:05:18,402
(groans and laughter)

1051
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:22,848
TRAVIS: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action
line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood

1052
01:05:22,848 --> 01:05:24,691
insurance, ja.

1053
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:26,846
MARISHA: The Geico slayer!

1054
01:05:26,846 --> 01:05:29,218
TRAVIS: Holy shit. That was amazing.

1055
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:32,807
MARISHA: Flo just got real, all right? Flo just
got real.

1056
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:34,715
TALIESIN: That's no better, actually.

1057
01:05:34,715 --> 01:05:40,116
MARISHA: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of
the-- you know what, never mind.

1058
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:45,323
MATT: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth
elemental doesn't multi-attack?

1059
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,273
MARISHA: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is--

1060
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:48,301
MATT: Right. Cool.

1061
01:05:48,301 --> 01:05:51,139
MARISHA: Oh no, wait! I have multi-- earth
elemental makes two slam attacks!

1062
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:53,399
MATT: That's good to know. Go ahead and make
another one.

1063
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:55,101
MARISHA: I could have done that last time?

1064
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:56,947
MATT: Are you attacking the stonework still?

1065
01:05:56,947 --> 01:06:00,740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other
chunk and punch it.

1066
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,669
MATT: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your
movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you

1067
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,376
can break up your movement. You can move, attack,
then move if you want to.

1068
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,622
MARISHA: You can?

1069
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:08,865
MATT: Yeah!

1070
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:10,999
TRAVIS: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by
the cage.

1071
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:16,947
MARISHA: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.

1072
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:20,853
MATT: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that
total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go

1073
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:23,439
ahead and roll damage.

1074
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:27,839
MARISHA: Ugh, four plus-- 18 damage.

1075
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:34,706
MATT: 18's fine. So you break out the second half
and now the entire side of it is open. All the

1076
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:38,567
fluid just spilled out the side and you get the
sensation this is very frowned upon.

1077
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:40,885
(laughter)

1078
01:06:40,885 --> 01:06:43,539
MATT: That ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up!

1079
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:45,220
TRAVIS: A tentacle frown.

1080
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:48,996
ORION: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?

1081
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:51,725
MATT: As a note too, just so you guys are aware--

1082
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:53,482
TALIESIN: I didn't know you were coming to the
carpet, sorry.

1083
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:56,168
LAURA: Oh no, we never closed the other door!

1084
01:06:56,168 --> 01:07:01,885
MATT: You start seeing a series of other entities
slowly making their way up from the downstairs

1085
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,221
tunnel area.

1086
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:07,452
SAM: I think we can beat them all.

1087
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:14,706
ORION: Seeing what's going on-- there's an
illithid right behind me, right?

1088
01:07:14,706 --> 01:07:16,732
MATT: There is. Right behind you, yeah.

1089
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:18,073
TRAVIS: I thought she closed the door.

1090
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,107
LAURA: No, we didn't.

1091
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:20,716
MATT: Yeah, the other door is open.

1092
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:24,124
MARISHA: I closed the one, but then he said that
they could levitate so I decided it

1093
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,494
wasn't worth it.

1094
01:07:25,494 --> 01:07:28,396
SAM: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an
80-pound dude.

1095
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:31,794
ORION: So I'm running off and then Percy takes
off? So I can't get to him?

1096
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:33,272
MATT: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him.

1097
01:07:33,272 --> 01:07:34,414
ORION: Awesome.

1098
01:07:34,414 --> 01:07:35,785
TRAVIS: I'm so ashamed right now.

1099
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:42,736
ORION: I need a technical question. Can I move the
Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my

1100
01:07:42,736 --> 01:07:47,540
turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like,
I want to let it go--

1101
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,844
MATT: No.

1102
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:55,209
ORION: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I
see Percy go and I'm like, "(growls) Damn

1103
01:07:55,209 --> 01:08:03,261
"Tiamat-lover!" So I bring over the Horn and right
at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. "You deal

1104
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:04,593
"with it then!"

1105
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:05,779
MATT: Percy?

1106
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:07,827
(loud clatter)

1107
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,160
LAURA: Oh no, K'Varn!

1108
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,669
MATT: That's what you get!

1109
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,918
ORION: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on
the carpet.

1110
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,805
MATT: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right
now, staring at him from the side.

1111
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:17,767
ASHLEY: Put it on, Percy!

1112
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:27,102
ORION: I see the-- oh god. Okay, I can only do
this once. I see the-- they're

1113
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:28,769
not inside yet, right?

1114
01:08:28,769 --> 01:08:32,009
MATT: No. They're just starting to get to the
doorway. You can see them right there.

1115
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:42,288
ORION: Awesome. Okay, that is a-- and this is a--
Okay.

1116
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:44,166
MATT: What you got, Tiberius?

1117
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:46,801
(laughter)

1118
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:49,239
TRAVIS: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.

1119
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:54,460
ORION: Right. I have-- I blow everything. I'm
going to blow everything.

1120
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,698
TRAVIS: Yes! Blow everybody.

1121
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:57,791
(laughter)

1122
01:08:57,791 --> 01:09:00,038
MATT: How diplomatic of you!

1123
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:02,898
SAM: I'm stunned!

1124
01:09:02,898 --> 01:09:05,874
ORION: You cannot resist!

1125
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:07,904
MATT: So, Tiberius.

1126
01:09:07,904 --> 01:09:14,271
ORION: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where
the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the

1127
01:09:14,345 --> 01:09:15,701
entryway.

1128
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:19,185
MATT: How many with that, what level are you using
it?

1129
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:22,071
ORION: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?

1130
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:24,555
MATT: It's a little over five feet wide.

1131
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:26,684
ORION: Great. I only need one, right?

1132
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:27,854
MATT: Technically, yeah.

1133
01:09:27,854 --> 01:09:32,060
ORION: Okay. So I seal that one-- I'm going to use
all three right now.

1134
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,634
MARISHA: Seal the other one, too. I only partially
sealed it.

1135
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:36,303
ORION: I'll seal the other one.

1136
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:37,489
MATT: Okay.

1137
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:39,584
ORION: And I'll use the other one on myself.

1138
01:09:39,584 --> 01:09:41,246
MATT: Okay!

1139
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:52,747
ORION: And I'm going to use-- I only have three
left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last

1140
01:09:52,747 --> 01:09:57,860
three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero
points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on

1141
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,129
myself. And that's my turn.

1142
01:10:01,129 --> 01:10:06,648
MATT: All righty. You now start hearing (boof,
boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the

1143
01:10:06,648 --> 01:10:10,639
stone walls. Both sides of the walls are now
sealed off with pillars, and a large pile of

1144
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:16,013
rubble on that side. All right, Percy, you're up.

1145
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:19,463
TALIESIN: All right, before I go anywhere, I'm
taking a shot at Clarota.

1146
01:10:19,463 --> 01:10:21,025
MATT: Okay.

1147
01:10:21,025 --> 01:10:23,865
MARISHA: Betraying bastard.

1148
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:31,218
TALIESIN: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15,
16, 17. 19 points?

1149
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,723
MATT: That hits.

1150
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:41,822
TALIESIN: That hits, and let's do my damage.
That's 22 points of damage.

1151
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:47,287
MATT: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you
feel the tentacles swirling around the back of

1152
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:52,173
your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of
your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all

1153
01:10:52,173 --> 01:10:56,170
of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find
a way towards your skull.

1154
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:58,744
(laughter)

1155
01:10:58,744 --> 01:11:02,637
MATT: And then the tentacles suddenly go limp as
the back of Clarota's head (gunshot)

1156
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,121
becomes a mess.

1157
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:06,783
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Traitor!

1158
01:11:06,783 --> 01:11:08,334
LAURA: I can't believe we killed Clarota!

1159
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:10,724
TALIESIN: Some people have no sense of fucking
honor!

1160
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,069
(laughter)

1161
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:13,094
MARISHA: Traitor!

1162
01:11:13,094 --> 01:11:14,343
TRAVIS: Oh, Percy!

1163
01:11:14,343 --> 01:11:18,174
MATT: In a split second, your longtime ally, now
turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor.

1164
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:20,539
You're released, you're no longer stunned.

1165
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:22,504
SAM: (gasps) Hi, guys!

1166
01:11:22,504 --> 01:11:23,761
TALIESIN: I still have another shot.

1167
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:24,863
MATT: You do.

1168
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,971
MARISHA: There's someone on Pike, right?

1169
01:11:27,971 --> 01:11:29,839
MATT: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah,
right here.

1170
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:31,003
TALIESIN: I'm taking a shot there.

1171
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:32,447
TRAVIS: Come on, Perce!

1172
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:33,573
ASHLEY: Perce!

1173
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:34,611
MARISHA: Pew pew!

1174
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:39,065
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! So that's 17-- 17, 18, 19--

1175
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:40,092
MATT: That hits.

1176
01:11:40,092 --> 01:11:43,562
TALIESIN: Okay, that just hits, all right. I'm
trying to use Sharpshooter, so it changes

1177
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:48,821
everything. And that's 18 points of damage.

1178
01:11:48,821 --> 01:11:50,169
MATT: Okay.

1179
01:11:50,169 --> 01:11:56,700
TALIESIN: And did we get a short rest before this
fight happened?

1180
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,944
SAM and LAURA: No.

1181
01:11:57,944 --> 01:11:58,917
TALIESIN: Fuck, never mind.

1182
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:00,240
MATT: No you did not.

1183
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,039
MARISHA: That's why we're all burnt out on
spells.

1184
01:12:02,039 --> 01:12:03,403
TALIESIN: That's why we're all burnt out on shit,
okay.

1185
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:04,481
ORION: Except me.

1186
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:05,932
MATT: Yeah, the other one--

1187
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:07,657
TALIESIN: I'm going to go up further.

1188
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,901
MATT: Even further? Okay.

1189
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:12,560
LAURA: "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks,
Tiberius!

1190
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,432
ASHLEY: "I abandoned my troop!"

1191
01:12:14,432 --> 01:12:16,650
ORION: It's going to come in handy now!

1192
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:20,443
TALIESIN: Am I high enough yet for her to jump
down onto the--

1193
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:22,661
MATT: Yeah, you could probably pull it off.

1194
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:25,143
TALIESIN: So, if you and your bear want to jump
on?

1195
01:12:25,143 --> 01:12:27,942
MATT: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah.

1196
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:29,546
SAM: Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save
us!

1197
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:32,074
LAURA: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly,
because I'm staying up top for right now, unless

1198
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:33,459
we can teleport out.

1199
01:12:33,459 --> 01:12:37,272
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case, instead of going up
I'm going to go fly to the right, then.

1200
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:39,645
ORION: Pick up Vax!

1201
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:41,059
LAURA: Why?

1202
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:42,469
ORION: I said Vax.

1203
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:43,506
LAURA: Vax?

1204
01:12:43,506 --> 01:12:44,559
MARISHA: Vax? Pick up Vax?

1205
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:45,556
ORION: Yes.

1206
01:12:45,556 --> 01:12:47,011
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards
Vax, as well.

1207
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:49,652
MATT: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?

1208
01:12:49,652 --> 01:12:50,634
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1209
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:53,121
MATT: Okay, you can get about-- we'll say, if
you're just going--

1210
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:54,214
TALIESIN: Yeah, go there.

1211
01:12:54,214 --> 01:12:55,518
MATT: All right.

1212
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:56,674
TALIESIN: Hi.

1213
01:12:56,674 --> 01:12:59,651
ASHLEY, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Hey you guys!

1214
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:03,669
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it--

1215
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:06,453
ASHLEY: Did anything happen to the guy that had
me--

1216
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:07,846
MATT: He just took damage, but he's not done yet.

1217
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:09,443
ASHLEY: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).

1218
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:11,234
MATT: So, Pike, it's your turn.

1219
01:13:11,234 --> 01:13:12,217
ASHLEY: It's my turn.

1220
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:14,747
MATT: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind
Blast stun.

1221
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,174
ASHLEY: Come on.

1222
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:17,927
SAM: Come on, Pikey.

1223
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:23,123
ASHLEY: Fuck. It's seven.

1224
01:13:23,123 --> 01:13:25,602
MATT: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place.

1225
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,290
TALIESIN: Can you heal yourself?

1226
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:32,775
MATT: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked
in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy

1227
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,222
is just clutching her brain and holding it
hostage.

1228
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:36,836
SAM: Still beautiful, though.

1229
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:38,551
(laughter)

1230
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:46,438
MATT: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to
pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth

1231
01:13:46,438 --> 01:13:50,511
of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the
skull, the actual bone it's found in the back.

1232
01:13:50,511 --> 01:13:53,282
Vax, you're up.

1233
01:13:53,282 --> 01:13:56,129
LIAM: What did Clarota do with his hat?

1234
01:13:56,129 --> 01:14:00,223
MATT: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here.

1235
01:14:00,223 --> 01:14:01,921
LIAM: Over behind--

1236
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:04,088
MATT: Over behind this.

1237
01:14:04,088 --> 01:14:09,034
LIAM: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run
down the center over Clar-- I'm going to step on

1238
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:14,805
Clarota's-- I don't know if he has nuts, but
whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run

1239
01:14:14,805 --> 01:14:17,708
around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my
head.

1240
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,040
MATT: Okay.

1241
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:26,386
LIAM: And then run up behind that third mind
flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and

1242
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:27,950
just start stabbing him in the back.

1243
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,009
MATT: Right here?

1244
01:14:29,009 --> 01:14:30,073
LAURA: No, on Pike!

1245
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:31,171
LIAM: I can't get back there.

1246
01:14:31,171 --> 01:14:31,923
LAURA: You can't?

1247
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:33,122
LIAM: I don't think so.

1248
01:14:33,122 --> 01:14:34,038
LAURA: Would he be able to make it?

1249
01:14:34,038 --> 01:14:35,033
LIAM: Well it's up to-- oh dear.

1250
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:39,855
MATT: You can't, with the speed you're running
there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so

1251
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:41,005
it's 60 feet.

1252
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:44,075
LIAM: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you
think that I could have run around the mind

1253
01:14:44,075 --> 01:14:45,896
flayer, put on the party hat--

1254
01:14:45,896 --> 01:14:48,970
MATT: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can

1255
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,231
move right there.

1256
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:53,090
LIAM: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing
him in the back, angrily.

1257
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,975
MATT: All right.

1258
01:14:54,975 --> 01:14:58,496
LIAM: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?

1259
01:14:58,652 --> 01:15:01,041
MATT: Unfortunately-- no, that does just hit.

1260
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:07,065
LIAM: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to
him. There's nothing in the rule book about

1261
01:15:07,114 --> 01:15:09,826
stunned, or unconscious, or anything.

1262
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:14,184
MATT: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to
someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel

1263
01:15:14,184 --> 01:15:16,406
like they have people on two fronts, which is why
you get the benefit.

1264
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:18,817
TALIESIN: He is, to be fair, very occupied.

1265
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:27,409
MATT: I will say, circumstantially though, because
he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the

1266
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:32,403
process of trying to grind into her brain with his
mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment.

1267
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:33,788
TRAVIS: He's sucking head.

1268
01:15:33,788 --> 01:15:40,858
MATT: So I'm going to go ahead and make a
perception roll versus your fast movement. Go

1269
01:15:40,858 --> 01:15:47,463
ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see
whether or not he takes notice and changes his

1270
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:48,917
position in defense.

1271
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,587
LIAM: I rolled a 24.

1272
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,826
MATT: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled
was a 15, that hits!

1273
01:15:52,826 --> 01:15:54,011
LIAM: Okay, thank you.

1274
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:56,220
MATT: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see
you coming that quickly.

1275
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:09,634
LIAM: All right, so that is four, plus seven is
11, plus-- okay, that's 17, 21, thank you. 26,

1276
01:16:09,634 --> 01:16:14,385
30, 33. 33 with keen dagger.

1277
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:16,287
MATT: 33 with the keen dagger?

1278
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:17,981
LIAM: And I'm sticking that in the back of his
neck.

1279
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:19,497
MATT: Okay. That was your first attack?

1280
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:20,582
LIAM: That's the first attack.

1281
01:16:20,582 --> 01:16:24,895
MATT: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into
the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all

1282
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:29,227
the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant
section out of the side of its head. The rest of

1283
01:16:29,227 --> 01:16:34,034
its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own
blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this

1284
01:16:34,034 --> 01:16:39,295
weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it
still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes

1285
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,524
glaring at you, basically telling you, "Look what
I'm about to do to your friend."

1286
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:48,092
LIAM: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I
take the other one, flip it in my hand and then

1287
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:51,383
stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.

1288
01:16:51,383 --> 01:16:52,567
MATT: That hits.

1289
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:58,271
LIAM: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I
don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm

1290
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:02,733
going to then stick him with my poison dagger,
which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26

1291
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:04,328
which hits as well.

1292
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,718
MATT: That does hit.

1293
01:17:05,718 --> 01:17:06,943
LIAM: And that is eight.

1294
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:11,351
MATT: Eight points of damage. So the first one you
stab in the side of the head, you pull back and

1295
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:15,012
toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it
bursts into flames you place the searing dagger

1296
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:19,079
down into the center of its back between its
shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does

1297
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:23,374
it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger
as you pull back the third one. As it looks back

1298
01:17:23,374 --> 01:17:28,910
at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes
in to directly go after Pike's head. The third

1299
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,993
dagger you then stab it right in the front of the
skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its

1300
01:17:33,993 --> 01:17:35,799
tentacles limply drag off.

1301
01:17:35,799 --> 01:17:37,421
(cheering)

1302
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:40,133
LIAM: As a bonus action, I would like to
Goodfellas-kick him about eight

1303
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,745
times in the ribs.

1304
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,091
(laughter)

1305
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,500
MARISHA: Yes!

1306
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:52,558
MATT: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy
was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she

1307
01:17:52,558 --> 01:17:54,701
would've taken 55 points of damage.

1308
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:57,479
TRAVIS: 50-- Let's not even say the number.

1309
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:58,745
ASHLEY: You saved my life.

1310
01:17:58,745 --> 01:18:02,300
MATT: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit
points, they extract the brain and eat it.

1311
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,601
LAURA: Now we've got to squish those little
brains.

1312
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:05,983
LIAM: There's still a mind flayer.

1313
01:18:05,983 --> 01:18:08,085
TRAVIS: We're coming real close.

1314
01:18:08,085 --> 01:18:12,958
MATT: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back.
Nope. Nope.

1315
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:14,791
LIAM: This show is not good for my blood
pressure.

1316
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:18,588
MARISHA: I know! It's like constant fight or
flight.

1317
01:18:18,588 --> 01:18:21,091
TRAVIS: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.

1318
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:24,244
MARISHA: This should fix your sleep schedule
though, right?

1319
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:25,825
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally.

1320
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:31,334
MATT: Seeing both of them get immediately
slaughtered, both of these illithids just Plane

1321
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:39,850
Shift. A defensive standpoint, self-preservation is kicking
in. However, intellect devourers do not have

1322
01:18:39,912 --> 01:18:50,545
self-preservation. They're there for a specific
reason. So this one here is going to move over to

1323
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:57,402
this side and is going to attempt to make a Devour
Intellect attack against Keyleth. Keyleth, go

1324
01:18:57,402 --> 01:19:00,068
ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.

1325
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:04,759
MARISHA: I'm an elemental, so.

1326
01:19:04,759 --> 01:19:06,794
MATT: You keep your intelligence score as you.

1327
01:19:06,794 --> 01:19:07,745
MARISHA: Oh, I do?

1328
01:19:07,745 --> 01:19:12,072
MATT: The physical attributes you get from the
elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom,

1329
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:13,434
and charisma.

1330
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:15,374
MARISHA: Okay, then 18.

1331
01:19:15,374 --> 01:19:21,960
MATT: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental
impact from the intellect devourer, now on the

1332
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:28,343
ground with its four feral legs, its brain form
rippling. The second one is going to turn over

1333
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:33,608
here and saw the two shots, the one that took out
Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've

1334
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:38,377
lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and
make an intellect saving throw.

1335
01:19:38,436 --> 01:19:39,749
TALIESIN: Eight.

1336
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:41,366
MATT: Eight? All righty.

1337
01:19:41,366 --> 01:19:43,006
SAM: Oh boy. That ain't no good.

1338
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:45,367
MATT: You take 11 points of psychic damage.

1339
01:19:45,367 --> 01:19:47,363
TALIESIN: There's an "and" there, isn't there?

1340
01:19:47,363 --> 01:19:50,916
SAM: And it's undone immediately.

1341
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,717
(laughter)

1342
01:19:53,717 --> 01:19:57,189
MATT: And you take eight points of intellect
damage.

1343
01:19:57,189 --> 01:20:00,860
LAURA: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!

1344
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,891
TRAVIS: You're better off than six, right?

1345
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:07,932
TALIESIN: Eight points of intellect damage. What
does that mean, precisely?

1346
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:09,450
LIAM: Minus from your intelligence.

1347
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:10,911
SAM: You would know if you had more intellect.

1348
01:20:10,911 --> 01:20:12,769
LAURA: Forever?

1349
01:20:12,769 --> 01:20:15,437
MATT: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically--
what's your intelligence?

1350
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:16,738
TALIESIN: 16.

1351
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:20,543
MATT: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just
shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your

1352
01:20:20,543 --> 01:20:21,581
intelligence.

1353
01:20:21,581 --> 01:20:23,210
TALIESIN: So do I still take eight more points of
damage, though?

1354
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,552
MATT: No, no no. You just the additional--

1355
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,402
TALIESIN: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh.

1356
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:28,272
(laughter)

1357
01:20:28,272 --> 01:20:30,981
MATT: Yeah, the intellect damage is not
permanent.

1358
01:20:30,981 --> 01:20:32,192
TALIESIN: I like purple.

1359
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:33,560
MATT: Not quite that bad.

1360
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,211
TRAVIS: I can't not do it.

1361
01:20:35,211 --> 01:20:43,924
MATT: All right. That ends their turn. That brings
us to Scanlan. You're no longer stunned. You now

1362
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,928
have full capacity of yourself and you're looking
around, oh shit.

1363
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:50,031
SAM: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill
these things?

1364
01:20:50,031 --> 01:20:51,089
TRAVIS: Can you get us out of here?

1365
01:20:51,089 --> 01:20:52,518
SAM: I can get some of us out of here.

1366
01:20:52,518 --> 01:20:53,516
MARISHA: Start getting us out.

1367
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:55,854
SAM: Are we getting out or are we fighting?

1368
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:57,254
TRAVIS: Getting us out.

1369
01:20:57,254 --> 01:20:59,908
MARISHA: Because we still have these fuckers we
have to--

1370
01:20:59,908 --> 01:21:02,025
ASHLEY: Because Tiberius can get some of us out,
right?

1371
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,459
LIAM: It's just the brains. Just the little
brains.

1372
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:04,752
SAM: It's just the little brains. For now.

1373
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:06,015
MATT: Make a perception check, by the way.

1374
01:21:06,015 --> 01:21:09,298
MARISHA: For now, but people can beat through
those doors. That's not a permanent thing.

1375
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:13,747
TALIESIN: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is
what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.

1376
01:21:13,747 --> 01:21:17,535
MARISHA: Well, we can start gathering our shit and
packing up.

1377
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:18,833
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1378
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,843
MARISHA: We can start packing up.

1379
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:22,942
SAM: Am I leaving or am I staying?

1380
01:21:22,942 --> 01:21:24,392
TRAVIS: You do what you want.

1381
01:21:24,392 --> 01:21:26,154
LIAM: Do what you want. It's chaos.

1382
01:21:26,154 --> 01:21:28,746
SAM: (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack.

1383
01:21:28,746 --> 01:21:35,276
MATT: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of
the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the

1384
01:21:35,276 --> 01:21:36,908
temple and out toward the top.

1385
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:39,534
LAURA: We should probably get out of here! They're
coming up the sides!

1386
01:21:39,534 --> 01:21:42,179
ASHLEY: We can't get you out of here if you don't
come--

1387
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:47,798
SAM: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I
want to have babies with you."

1388
01:21:47,798 --> 01:21:49,567
(laughter)

1389
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:58,036
SAM: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come
to you with Dimension Door.

1390
01:21:58,194 --> 01:22:02,959
ASHLEY: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before
we leave?

1391
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,371
(laughter)

1392
01:22:04,371 --> 01:22:05,949
SAM: And we get out.

1393
01:22:05,949 --> 01:22:07,863
MATT: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast.
You haven't made your save.

1394
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:12,239
SAM: We're going up to the top of the-- to the
thing. Just to the roof there.

1395
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,230
LAURA: They're coming up the sides!

1396
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,480
ASHLEY: We've got to go somewhere else.

1397
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:19,891
SAM: Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's
done.

1398
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:22,630
ORION: It's fine. It's good that they're up
there.

1399
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:29,758
SAM: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some
inspiration to Grog.

1400
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:34,680
MATT: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go
ahead and look back. Using the song of love you

1401
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,418
gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog.
Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10

1402
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:40,775
inspiration dice to you.

1403
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:41,746
TRAVIS: Okay.

1404
01:22:41,746 --> 01:22:43,321
LIAM: Grog, we would like you to rage.

1405
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:46,849
TRAVIS: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking
grappled. Is it my turn?

1406
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:48,554
MATT: It is now.

1407
01:22:48,554 --> 01:22:51,438
TRAVIS: Oh, can I try it for the third time to
break free?

1408
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:53,404
MATT: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your
athletics.

1409
01:22:53,404 --> 01:22:54,688
LIAM: Use that inspiration die, man.

1410
01:22:54,688 --> 01:22:56,807
TRAVIS: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I
rolled balls again.

1411
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:59,242
MATT: Well, you can use it after you do it. See
what you roll and then add it.

1412
01:22:59,404 --> 01:23:00,452
TRAVIS: It's athletics, right?

1413
01:23:00,452 --> 01:23:01,453
MATT: Athletics, yeah.

1414
01:23:01,453 --> 01:23:02,496
TRAVIS: 18.

1415
01:23:02,496 --> 01:23:03,337
MATT: 18?

1416
01:23:03,337 --> 01:23:05,120
LIAM: Come on.

1417
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,589
MATT: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the
creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you

1418
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:13,910
from behind the bars. You can see there's this
slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was

1419
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,708
holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the
bars.

1420
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:20,049
TRAVIS: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up
the rope?

1421
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:23,646
MATT: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone.

1422
01:23:23,646 --> 01:23:25,619
MARISHA: We've got to get Kima out.

1423
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:27,114
TRAVIS: Fuck Lady Kima!

1424
01:23:27,114 --> 01:23:28,446
ORION: Pick her up!

1425
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:30,594
LAURA: I thought you had a crush on her?

1426
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,031
ASHLEY: Can he grab her and climb?

1427
01:23:32,031 --> 01:23:33,941
MATT: You can. She's not a big stone structure.

1428
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:36,702
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying
to climb up the rope.

1429
01:23:36,702 --> 01:23:38,893
MATT: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form.

1430
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:40,321
SAM: Put her in the Bag of Holding!

1431
01:23:40,321 --> 01:23:42,438
OTHERS: No!

1432
01:23:42,438 --> 01:23:44,002
TRAVIS: She's stone! It doesn't matter!

1433
01:23:44,002 --> 01:23:45,430
ORION: Don't do that!

1434
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,955
TRAVIS: I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to
her.

1435
01:23:48,955 --> 01:23:50,730
SAM: No, put her in the bag!

1436
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:55,841
MARISHA: Can you make one of those baby slings?
Stuff her in your belt?

1437
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:57,930
TALIESIN: It's not time for arts and crafts.

1438
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:02,052
MATT: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her
in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently

1439
01:24:02,052 --> 01:24:04,303
dangling from this side where you guys first came
in.

1440
01:24:04,303 --> 01:24:05,769
LAURA: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.

1441
01:24:05,769 --> 01:24:12,661
MATT: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can
just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash

1442
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:14,436
action you can begin to climb, if you'd like.

1443
01:24:14,436 --> 01:24:15,450
TRAVIS: I would like to climb.

1444
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,755
MATT: Okay.

1445
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:18,859
SAM: I would like to raise.

1446
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:22,540
TRAVIS: I would like to rage. Rage climb.

1447
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:25,681
MATT: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like
(grunts).

1448
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:26,663
ORION: Yes!

1449
01:24:26,663 --> 01:24:30,787
MATT: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty
intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

1450
01:24:30,787 --> 01:24:33,087
MARISHA: Yes. That Crossfit training come in
handy.

1451
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:34,090
TRAVIS: 17.

1452
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:37,500
MATT: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is
going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it

1453
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,747
doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady
Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm

1454
01:24:41,747 --> 01:24:45,244
as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting
yourself up as fast as you can.

1455
01:24:45,244 --> 01:24:46,999
TRAVIS: You better remember this when you wake
up.

1456
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:47,745
(laughter)

1457
01:24:47,745 --> 01:24:48,703
MATT: Rage-climbing up the rope.

1458
01:24:48,703 --> 01:24:49,969
LIAM: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity!

1459
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:50,901
(laughter)

1460
01:24:50,901 --> 01:24:52,418
MATT: That brings us to Vex.

1461
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:56,251
LAURA: I should just stay where I am, right guys?

1462
01:24:56,316 --> 01:24:57,699
TALIESIN: And you should shoot things.

1463
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:01,653
LAURA: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any
other--

1464
01:25:01,653 --> 01:25:03,751
there's just a little brain in there right now?

1465
01:25:03,751 --> 01:25:07,538
MATT: Right now there's two brains, and you can
see just in the outskirts of the temple's side

1466
01:25:07,538 --> 01:25:10,441
here, two more illithid that are making their way
up the side of the temple.

1467
01:25:10,441 --> 01:25:11,549
LAURA: Oh, fuck me.

1468
01:25:11,549 --> 01:25:15,083
MATT: With about a hundred or so just now
gathering towards the bottom of the temple base.

1469
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:21,145
LAURA: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real
fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because

1470
01:25:21,145 --> 01:25:23,353
things are coming up the side and we need to get
out of here.

1471
01:25:23,353 --> 01:25:27,006
SAM: But what if there's gold down there to find?

1472
01:25:27,006 --> 01:25:34,961
LAURA: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's
Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking

1473
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:36,694
the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?

1474
01:25:36,694 --> 01:25:38,978
TALIESIN: Elder Brain is spilling out the side
now, isn't it?

1475
01:25:38,978 --> 01:25:42,889
MATT: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the
stonework on the outside of it is currently

1476
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:44,531
knocked out.

1477
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:46,770
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's
just jump on it.

1478
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:48,973
LIAM: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that
brain.

1479
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:51,276
LAURA: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.

1480
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:55,948
LIAM: Maybe if-- we should try to get out of here,
but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll

1481
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:59,953
stun them or send them reeling or something, or
make them mad.

1482
01:25:59,953 --> 01:26:05,055
LAURA: All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it
again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do

1483
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:06,484
Hail of Thorns on it.

1484
01:26:06,484 --> 01:26:07,956
MATT: All right.

1485
01:26:07,956 --> 01:26:13,640
LAURA: 27.

1486
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:20,454
MATT: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you
can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the

1487
01:26:20,454 --> 01:26:26,904
arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical--
just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns.

1488
01:26:26,904 --> 01:26:30,106
LIAM: Get it.

1489
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:34,637
LAURA: I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to
that damage, or just my regular and then that?

1490
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:38,978
MATT: At the end of all the damage you dealt with
the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that.

1491
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:40,448
LAURA: Okay.

1492
01:26:40,448 --> 01:26:46,004
LIAM: Big money.

1493
01:26:46,004 --> 01:26:49,269
LAURA: 22. 24.

1494
01:26:49,269 --> 01:26:55,405
MATT: 24, all righty. Keyleth, go ahead and make a
reflex saving throw.

1495
01:26:55,405 --> 01:26:56,800
MARISHA: What's happening?

1496
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,760
LAURA: Oh, right, because you're right next to it,
sorry Keyleth.

1497
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:06,499
MARISHA: Oh, it's okay. My reflex-- I use my dex
modifier for my elemental, correct?

1498
01:27:06,499 --> 01:27:09,454
MATT: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's
dexterity.

1499
01:27:09,454 --> 01:27:10,649
MARISHA: Ten.

1500
01:27:10,649 --> 01:27:12,768
MATT: Ten? Versus your spell save of--

1501
01:27:12,768 --> 01:27:13,922
LAURA: 14.

1502
01:27:13,922 --> 01:27:16,781
MATT: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take
24 points of damage.

1503
01:27:16,781 --> 01:27:19,122
LAURA: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really
strong.

1504
01:27:19,122 --> 01:27:20,653
MARISHA: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.

1505
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:21,773
LAURA: Okay.

1506
01:27:21,773 --> 01:27:23,442
MARISHA: So how many points? 21?

1507
01:27:23,442 --> 01:27:29,596
MATT: 24. So, all the thorns explode against your
rocky physical form; you just shrug it off, like

1508
01:27:29,596 --> 01:27:32,826
it's nothing. (laughs) It tickles a little.

1509
01:27:32,826 --> 01:27:33,954
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

1510
01:27:33,954 --> 01:27:36,405
LAURA: So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack
it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.

1511
01:27:36,405 --> 01:27:37,142
MATT: Okay.

1512
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,765
ORION: Yeah.

1513
01:27:38,765 --> 01:27:40,152
LAURA: 17?

1514
01:27:40,152 --> 01:27:43,183
MATT: All right, 17-- actually no, 17 will miss.

1515
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:45,654
LAURA: Oh really, with it oozing out and
everything?

1516
01:27:45,654 --> 01:27:49,752
MATT: The second, there's some sort of psychic
protective field in the brain. As you fire down,

1517
01:27:49,752 --> 01:27:54,085
the arrow looks like it should strike and then it
just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then

1518
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:56,084
just splinters against the stonework next to
the--

1519
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,357
LAURA: Fudge!

1520
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:58,420
TRAVIS: Fudge.

1521
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,614
MATT: You going to stay where you are? You going
to move?

1522
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:01,901
ORION: Get on Trinket!

1523
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:06,730
LAURA: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some
reason, because that makes sense.

1524
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:12,619
MATT: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That
brings us to Keyleth. You're up.

1525
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:19,865
MARISHA: Okay, what's the situation with the brain
soup?

1526
01:28:19,865 --> 01:28:22,334
MATT: The liquid is poured out.

1527
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:25,920
MARISHA: And how are the brains? Are just brains
just floating downstream?

1528
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,373
MATT: No, it's actually all-- at a long distance,
it looks like one giant brain, close up it looks

1529
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:33,244
like all of these smaller brains have all
congealed into one giant mind.

1530
01:28:33,244 --> 01:28:34,651
LAURA: It's like a jello mold of brains.

1531
01:28:34,651 --> 01:28:37,959
MARISHA: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's
fluid coming out from underneath of it?

1532
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:42,665
MATT: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in,
it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out

1533
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:44,659
onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick.

1534
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:56,035
MARISHA: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm
going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm

1535
01:28:56,035 --> 01:29:00,598
going to get under where the brain would be, and
I'm going to Superman punch it!

1536
01:29:00,648 --> 01:29:01,796
LAURA: Yes!

1537
01:29:01,864 --> 01:29:03,390
ORION: Yeah!

1538
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,611
MARISHA: From underneath.

1539
01:29:04,663 --> 01:29:07,138
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll.

1540
01:29:07,186 --> 01:29:09,481
TRAVIS: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.

1541
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:11,385
MARISHA: 23!

1542
01:29:11,385 --> 01:29:14,119
MATT: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1543
01:29:14,119 --> 01:29:23,501
MARISHA: (laughs) 11? Wait, is that my--

1544
01:29:23,501 --> 01:29:25,136
TALIESIN: No, 22.

1545
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:27,104
MARISHA: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.

1546
01:29:27,104 --> 01:29:34,151
MATT: It's not double damage, because you're not
hitting the structure. So 11 points of damage? All

1547
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:36,944
right, now I want you to go ahead and make a
strength check.

1548
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,849
MARISHA: Okay, that sounds fun.

1549
01:29:38,849 --> 01:29:42,182
MATT: So just roll and add your strength modifier
of the earth elemental.

1550
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:43,405
MARISHA: 14?

1551
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:49,432
MATT: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still
partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist

1552
01:29:49,494 --> 01:29:53,272
comes through and it slams in, and you feel this
sickening thud sound as your fist hits the

1553
01:29:53,272 --> 01:29:59,092
interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit
but it stays in its place held aloft by its own

1554
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:04,218
psychic defense mechanism. Make your second
attack.

1555
01:30:04,218 --> 01:30:09,384
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, same, 21.

1556
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:11,306
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that
one.

1557
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:12,155
LAURA: Big damage!

1558
01:30:12,155 --> 01:30:13,007
MARISHA: Come on.

1559
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:14,442
TALIESIN: Big money.

1560
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:16,594
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 16.

1561
01:30:16,594 --> 01:30:18,661
MATT: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another
strength check.

1562
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:27,634
MARISHA: Eight.

1563
01:30:27,634 --> 01:30:32,464
MATT: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist
into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed

1564
01:30:32,464 --> 01:30:36,995
partially by the psychic field around the brain.
It holds itself in place. It's still not moving

1565
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:38,770
from within that small--

1566
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,080
MARISHA: Do I stay or do I get out?

1567
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,048
LAURA: Get out.

1568
01:30:41,048 --> 01:30:41,996
ORION: Get out.

1569
01:30:41,996 --> 01:30:46,003
MATT: You still have about-- I'd say it only took
you about 15 feet of movement

1570
01:30:46,003 --> 01:30:47,239
to get underneath it.

1571
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,635
MARISHA: In my burrowing speed, right?

1572
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:49,493
MATT: Yeah.

1573
01:30:49,493 --> 01:30:53,657
MARISHA: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the
side of the mountain-- up the side of the temple,

1574
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,379
so I can pop out next to them.

1575
01:30:55,379 --> 01:31:03,373
MATT: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.
What's your total burrow speed?

1576
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:05,062
MARISHA: 60.

1577
01:31:05,062 --> 01:31:07,596
MATT: So you'll be about there.

1578
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:08,585
MARISHA: Okay.

1579
01:31:08,585 --> 01:31:10,553
MATT: So you're about as high as Tiberius is,
partially up the wall.

1580
01:31:10,553 --> 01:31:13,041
MARISHA: I'm in the wall.

1581
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:15,944
LAURA: They won't see you.

1582
01:31:15,944 --> 01:31:21,970
TRAVIS: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?

1583
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:23,287
LIAM: Yeah.

1584
01:31:23,287 --> 01:31:29,702
MATT: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda
have a brief look at the outside of the wall and

1585
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:35,326
on the opposite side there are two other mind
flayers. One more coming up on the side and

1586
01:31:35,326 --> 01:31:41,816
another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming
onto the bricks you left up. And these two

1587
01:31:41,816 --> 01:31:45,939
illithids are starting to look up and see you
moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see

1588
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:51,409
the opening in the top of the-- where the wall
collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda

1589
01:31:51,409 --> 01:31:57,991
start drifting up towards it. So that ends your
turn. Tiberius, you're up.

1590
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:00,736
ORION: What's the order after me?

1591
01:32:00,736 --> 01:32:07,749
MATT: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they
go. Then Scanlan, Grog.

1592
01:32:07,749 --> 01:32:10,009
TALIESIN: I was going to hold my turn to get
everybody on the carpet.

1593
01:32:10,064 --> 01:32:12,346
LIAM: I'm coming.

1594
01:32:12,346 --> 01:32:24,371
ORION: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level.
I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast

1595
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:27,621
it on-- you're not there.

1596
01:32:27,621 --> 01:32:28,693
LAURA: Trinket!

1597
01:32:28,693 --> 01:32:30,045
ORION: Trinket. (groans)

1598
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,089
TRAVIS: She's on Trinket.

1599
01:32:31,089 --> 01:32:32,594
LAURA: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?

1600
01:32:32,594 --> 01:32:33,590
ORION: Yeah.

1601
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,797
LAURA: Sweet!

1602
01:32:34,797 --> 01:32:40,105
MATT: All right, so Grog, Trinket, and--

1603
01:32:40,105 --> 01:32:41,198
ORION: Me.

1604
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:42,224
MATT: Yourself. Okay.

1605
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:44,185
ORION: And I (flying noise).

1606
01:32:44,185 --> 01:32:45,930
MATT: What's the fly speed on that?

1607
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,349
ORION: Um, outside?

1608
01:32:47,349 --> 01:32:48,928
LIAM: A skillion.

1609
01:32:48,928 --> 01:32:52,084
ORION: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.

1610
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:54,710
MATT: It's on the card, the cards I gave you.

1611
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:58,193
ORION: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60
feet.

1612
01:32:58,193 --> 01:33:04,280
MATT: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're
now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter

1613
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:09,288
Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's
just gotten used to flying on its own, that one

1614
01:33:09,288 --> 01:33:12,424
time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its
back. (bear noises)

1615
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:13,979
LAURA: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.

1616
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:15,168
ASHLEY: You got it, Trink.

1617
01:33:15,168 --> 01:33:16,678
MATT: All right.

1618
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:21,742
ORION: Oh wait, hold on-- I want to turn to to
everybody and go, "Fly, you fools."

1619
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:26,766
MATT: It's a free action, I'll let you do that.
(laughs) Percy, you're up.

1620
01:33:26,766 --> 01:33:28,363
TALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.

1621
01:33:28,363 --> 01:33:29,484
MATT: You're holding back?

1622
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:30,665
TALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.

1623
01:33:30,665 --> 01:33:36,670
MATT: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead
and make an intellect saving throw.

1624
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,564
LAURA: Yes!

1625
01:33:40,564 --> 01:33:41,903
ASHLEY: 19.

1626
01:33:41,903 --> 01:33:45,307
MATT: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the
Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify.

1627
01:33:45,357 --> 01:33:48,835
SAM: Does she fall in love with the first thing
she sees?

1628
01:33:48,835 --> 01:33:50,834
(laughter)

1629
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:54,608
MATT: (laughs) The first thing you do see is
Scanlan holding you. You're now outside of the

1630
01:33:54,608 --> 01:34:00,975
temple. There's the dark, kind of dull glowing
green atmosphere outside the entire Yug'Voril city

1631
01:34:01,029 --> 01:34:06,619
around you, with bits of blue crystal, you know,
against the cavern walls. It's scary. You look

1632
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:09,623
around you, you can see illithid charging up the
side of the temple, just gliding toward you

1633
01:34:09,623 --> 01:34:13,772
angrily. You look forward and on your shoulders,
clutching you, is Scanlan, blood streaking down

1634
01:34:13,834 --> 01:34:15,954
the front of his face with a big smile.

1635
01:34:15,954 --> 01:34:17,340
ASHLEY: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?

1636
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,174
SAM: I'm fine, baby. How are you?

1637
01:34:19,174 --> 01:34:23,390
ASHLEY: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just
going to pretend I'm happy so

1638
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:26,618
that everybody can be okay.

1639
01:34:26,688 --> 01:34:28,214
(laughter)

1640
01:34:28,214 --> 01:34:29,812
ORION: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.

1641
01:34:29,812 --> 01:34:32,196
ASHLEY: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure
Wounds.

1642
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:33,812
MATT: Okay.

1643
01:34:33,812 --> 01:34:38,889
ASHLEY: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low
is everybody? Not really that low?

1644
01:34:38,889 --> 01:34:40,261
LAURA: Nobody's really low.

1645
01:34:40,261 --> 01:34:41,470
TRAVIS: I'm at 32.

1646
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,374
ASHLEY: He's pretty low.

1647
01:34:42,374 --> 01:34:43,632
TALIESIN: You two are the only ones.

1648
01:34:43,632 --> 01:34:47,957
LAURA: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh,
no. We should just keep her stone for now.

1649
01:34:47,957 --> 01:34:49,778
SAM: You're low. You're super low.

1650
01:34:49,778 --> 01:34:51,666
LAURA: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.

1651
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:53,084
TRAVIS: Heal yourself.

1652
01:34:53,084 --> 01:34:56,983
TALIESIN: She can hold this part of her turn until
everybody's up there.

1653
01:34:56,983 --> 01:35:00,278
MATT: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass
Cure Wounds is for multiple people.

1654
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,226
ASHLEY: No, can I just do--

1655
01:35:02,226 --> 01:35:03,365
MATT: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself.

1656
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:04,156
ASHLEY: I can?

1657
01:35:04,156 --> 01:35:04,959
MATT: Yeah.

1658
01:35:04,959 --> 01:35:05,975
ASHLEY: But he needs it, too.

1659
01:35:05,975 --> 01:35:07,844
MATT: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have
to be next to him to do that.

1660
01:35:07,844 --> 01:35:08,864
ASHLEY: Shit.

1661
01:35:08,864 --> 01:35:10,518
TRAVIS: Just do your thing. You need it.

1662
01:35:10,518 --> 01:35:12,500
ASHLEY: All right, I need it? Oh no.

1663
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,483
MATT: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you.

1664
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:18,184
TRAVIS: The DM recommends it.

1665
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:19,970
(laughter)

1666
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:23,235
MATT: You were so close to dying again. I was so
scared.

1667
01:35:23,235 --> 01:35:24,831
TRAVIS: I stringently urge you.

1668
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:26,634
LIAM: Four out of five DMs recommend.

1669
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:28,546
(laughter)

1670
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:29,813
ASHLEY: All right, 17.

1671
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:33,516
MATT: Okay, so you heal yourself 17 hit points.
You clutch your holy symbol. You feel the warmth

1672
01:35:33,516 --> 01:35:36,551
fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly. You
feel a little better, because you were on death's

1673
01:35:36,551 --> 01:35:42,870
door there. All right. You want to move at all?
Anything else you want to do this turn

1674
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,062
or are you good?

1675
01:35:44,062 --> 01:35:45,646
ASHLEY: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?

1676
01:35:45,646 --> 01:35:47,985
ORION: Get on the bear!

1677
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:50,789
LAURA: No, he can't--

1678
01:35:50,789 --> 01:35:52,969
MATT: You don't have to.

1679
01:35:52,969 --> 01:35:54,510
ASHLEY: He can "bear-ly" hold one.

1680
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,486
(groans and laughter)

1681
01:35:56,486 --> 01:35:57,741
LAURA: Ba dum tss.

1682
01:35:57,741 --> 01:35:58,874
ASHLEY: I can't do that, right?

1683
01:35:58,874 --> 01:35:59,955
MATT: What?

1684
01:35:59,955 --> 01:36:01,439
ASHLEY: I can't get on Trinket?

1685
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:05,086
MATT: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex.

1686
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:09,138
ASHLEY: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan
a kiss on his cheek.

1687
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,753
SAM: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?

1688
01:36:11,753 --> 01:36:12,515
MATT: You do.

1689
01:36:12,515 --> 01:36:13,692
(laughter)

1690
01:36:13,692 --> 01:36:16,099
MATT: A d6 inspiration dice.

1691
01:36:16,168 --> 01:36:17,947
SAM: I'm never going to wash it again.

1692
01:36:17,947 --> 01:36:20,759
ORION: You never wash it to begin with.

1693
01:36:20,759 --> 01:36:23,539
MATT: It's this strangely romantic moment as she
reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the

1694
01:36:23,539 --> 01:36:27,808
cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this
beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick

1695
01:36:27,808 --> 01:36:32,345
in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the
(inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side

1696
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:33,527
of the temple.

1697
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:34,814
MARISHA: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!

1698
01:36:34,814 --> 01:36:37,468
ASHLEY: Oh no, we got to get it together.

1699
01:36:37,522 --> 01:36:39,481
MATT: All right, Vax.

1700
01:36:39,481 --> 01:36:45,070
LIAM: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain.
I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss

1701
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:50,235
you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into
the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I

1702
01:36:50,282 --> 01:36:54,773
go. First one-- misses. Second one is a 25.

1703
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:56,389
MATT: 25, okay.

1704
01:36:56,389 --> 01:36:59,484
LIAM: Which gets nine damage.

1705
01:36:59,484 --> 01:37:00,836
MATT: All right.

1706
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:03,343
LIAM: And last dagger is a 13.

1707
01:37:03,396 --> 01:37:04,465
MATT: No.

1708
01:37:04,465 --> 01:37:07,891
LIAM: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a
little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.

1709
01:37:07,891 --> 01:37:10,207
MATT: Jump on the flying carpet. All righty.

1710
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:14,605
LIAM: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss
him on the cheek, and say, "Let's get out of here,

1711
01:37:14,605 --> 01:37:15,793
"you bastard."

1712
01:37:15,793 --> 01:37:17,377
TALIESIN: Do I get an inspiration point for that?

1713
01:37:17,377 --> 01:37:18,278
(laughter)

1714
01:37:18,278 --> 01:37:19,220
MATT: No.

1715
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,708
LAURA: That's a double standard.

1716
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:24,044
TALIESIN: You know how I feel about you.

1717
01:37:24,044 --> 01:37:27,221
LIAM: Fight the patriarchy.

1718
01:37:27,221 --> 01:37:30,963
MATT: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of
something beautiful.

1719
01:37:30,963 --> 01:37:32,609
TALIESIN: I'm feeling something new.

1720
01:37:32,609 --> 01:37:40,229
MATT: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the
dice may come naturally. So you're holding your

1721
01:37:40,244 --> 01:37:42,159
turn? Percy, you want to go now?

1722
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,059
TALIESIN: I want to go now.

1723
01:37:43,059 --> 01:37:44,666
MATT: All right. So, that brings you here. Percy,
go ahead.

1724
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:49,237
TALIESIN: I'm just going to reel straight up. And
on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at

1725
01:37:49,237 --> 01:37:50,339
the brain.

1726
01:37:50,339 --> 01:37:57,736
MATT: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes
of this. Taking two more shots?

1727
01:37:57,736 --> 01:38:00,141
TALIESIN: 16.

1728
01:38:00,141 --> 01:38:04,155
LIAM: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!

1729
01:38:04,155 --> 01:38:07,164
MATT: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first
roll?

1730
01:38:07,164 --> 01:38:08,354
TALIESIN: 16.

1731
01:38:08,354 --> 01:38:12,375
MATT: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay.
We're just going to put it down there.

1732
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:13,763
TALIESIN: And 19.

1733
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:18,598
MATT: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it.
It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf)

1734
01:38:18,598 --> 01:38:21,706
The bullet sinking again into the fleshy
membrane.

1735
01:38:21,706 --> 01:38:24,008
TALIESIN: The second one has a bonus die, yay.

1736
01:38:24,008 --> 01:38:25,032
MATT: Ice shot.

1737
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,225
TALIESIN: Ice shot.

1738
01:38:26,225 --> 01:38:27,528
MARISHA: Maybe you'll freeze it.

1739
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:29,071
LIAM: Percy and Vax, ship it!

1740
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:32,305
TALIESIN: That's 13 points plus two points of ice
damage.

1741
01:38:32,305 --> 01:38:37,398
MATT: Okay, so 16 total. All right. As it blasts
inside, you can see the ice, these strange

1742
01:38:37,567 --> 01:38:43,275
crystals of frozen liquid, they burst out, almost
like it actually freezes the blue explosion in

1743
01:38:43,275 --> 01:38:49,317
place for a moment, and then the ice just slowly
melts away. Yeah, there's some damage dealt to

1744
01:38:49,317 --> 01:38:56,384
it, but this is a hardy sack of hit points. And
it's coming online. So with the end of your turn,

1745
01:38:56,435 --> 01:39:02,184
the brain, now taken a bunch of hits, begins to
pulse with energy, now that it's been freed from

1746
01:39:02,184 --> 01:39:06,446
its control and it's slowly brought itself out of
this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by

1747
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:10,655
K'Varn. The Elder Brain is now becoming conscious
once again.

1748
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,045
LIAM: Oh dear.

1749
01:39:12,045 --> 01:39:15,574
TALIESIN: Can we go up there? Can you put us at
our height now?

1750
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:17,288
(laughter)

1751
01:39:17,288 --> 01:39:20,103
MARISHA: Can you represent us accurately?

1752
01:39:20,103 --> 01:39:29,781
MATT: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are,
it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant

1753
01:39:29,781 --> 01:39:36,842
psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just
cascades out of the center and just fills the room

1754
01:39:36,842 --> 01:39:41,453
for a second with this large dull thud-like
"thoom" sound. All of you instinctively look down

1755
01:39:41,453 --> 01:39:47,025
and see this explosion that just dissipates as it
crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is

1756
01:39:47,025 --> 01:39:48,292
just out of range.

1757
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:52,913
TALIESIN: You're wearing the helmet, at least.

1758
01:39:52,913 --> 01:39:56,802
MATT: At which point, you guys who are at the top,
looking off to the side, all the illithid that are

1759
01:39:56,802 --> 01:40:01,852
rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of
purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like

1760
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:04,853
now the Elder Brain has come back online and has
reconnected with its people.

1761
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,639
LAURA: Out, out, out!

1762
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:12,503
MATT: All right, that brings us to Grog. Grog.

1763
01:40:12,503 --> 01:40:14,181
TRAVIS: I can keep flying up?

1764
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:18,583
MATT: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy
to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand

1765
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:19,702
over hand.

1766
01:40:19,702 --> 01:40:20,787
ORION: You can fly, Grog!

1767
01:40:20,787 --> 01:40:25,678
TRAVIS: I have one more level three, whatever it's
called, level three healing potion. They're called

1768
01:40:25,678 --> 01:40:27,832
called superior or something? What's the word for
it?

1769
01:40:27,832 --> 01:40:28,742
MATT: Yeah.

1770
01:40:28,742 --> 01:40:29,793
TRAVIS: I'd like to take that.

1771
01:40:29,793 --> 01:40:38,196
MARISHA: I have so much adrenaline during these
kind of fights.

1772
01:40:38,196 --> 01:40:39,469
TALIESIN: I know.

1773
01:40:39,469 --> 01:40:44,440
MATT: They're moving around, they're angry, they
can't quite get to their targets.

1774
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,799
TRAVIS: I heal 24 points of hit damage.

1775
01:40:46,799 --> 01:40:57,428
MATT: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the
attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the

1776
01:40:57,428 --> 01:41:11,285
door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind
it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin

1777
01:41:11,285 --> 01:41:12,486
to drift up.

1778
01:41:12,486 --> 01:41:13,849
LAURA: No!

1779
01:41:13,849 --> 01:41:16,178
MATT: As far as they can get.

1780
01:41:16,178 --> 01:41:17,789
TRAVIS: Fuck this house of horrors.

1781
01:41:17,789 --> 01:41:18,789
ASHLEY: How do we get out of here?

1782
01:41:18,789 --> 01:41:20,483
LAURA: How <i>are</i> we going to get out of here?

1783
01:41:20,483 --> 01:41:29,269
MATT: They are going to attempt two Mind Blasts.
All right. That's as high as they get with

1784
01:41:29,332 --> 01:41:32,612
levitation. With the full height that takes the
top, because technically you guys are up here, I

1785
01:41:32,612 --> 01:41:39,021
just couldn't put the structure that high up. The
only people-- The only person that's in the radius

1786
01:41:39,021 --> 01:41:43,188
would be Scanlan and Pike. Again.

1787
01:41:43,188 --> 01:41:44,852
ASHLEY: All right.

1788
01:41:44,852 --> 01:41:46,965
MATT: Both of you guys make intellect saving
throws again.

1789
01:41:46,965 --> 01:41:50,311
SAM: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole
time.

1790
01:41:50,311 --> 01:41:51,606
ASHLEY: Can you sing?

1791
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:52,860
MARISHA: You've got that inspiration die.

1792
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,333
SAM: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.

1793
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:56,332
MATT: What did you roll?

1794
01:41:56,332 --> 01:41:57,165
SAM: I'm at 20.

1795
01:41:57,165 --> 01:41:58,244
MATT: Okay.

1796
01:41:58,244 --> 01:41:59,042
ASHLEY: 14.

1797
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:00,328
MATT: 14? All right.

1798
01:42:00,328 --> 01:42:03,872
SAM: Can I sing for her?

1799
01:42:03,872 --> 01:42:12,620
MATT: (laughs) Unfortunately, you have to do that
on your turn. You manage to resist the effects of

1800
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:17,497
it. You take 22 points of psychic damage and once
again your brain clenches--

1801
01:42:17,497 --> 01:42:20,020
LAURA: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!

1802
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,531
MATT: Damn good thing you healed yourself.

1803
01:42:21,531 --> 01:42:24,972
SAM: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!

1804
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,847
LAURA: Yeah. That's the second time this round.

1805
01:42:27,847 --> 01:42:32,284
MATT: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits
you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as

1806
01:42:32,284 --> 01:42:36,061
she reaches up and grabs the side of her head
again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which

1807
01:42:36,061 --> 01:42:38,522
you manage to catch before they clatter down into
the temple.

1808
01:42:38,581 --> 01:42:39,661
ASHLEY: Okay.

1809
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:41,376
SAM: Baby, come on.

1810
01:42:41,376 --> 01:42:43,838
ASHLEY: Maybe we'll be okay?

1811
01:42:43,838 --> 01:42:46,005
MARISHA: Do you want some more dice?

1812
01:42:46,005 --> 01:42:51,378
MATT: All right, Grog, you're up. Oh no, you're up
there, they went. That brings it to the top of the

1813
01:42:51,562 --> 01:42:53,074
round. Vex, you're up.

1814
01:42:53,074 --> 01:42:55,158
MARISHA: Take it, take it. Give it to her,
please.

1815
01:42:55,158 --> 01:42:56,391
ORION: Head to the beach!

1816
01:42:56,391 --> 01:42:57,577
SAM: Wait, top of the round?

1817
01:42:57,577 --> 01:43:02,623
MATT: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very
end, the new guys burst in and attacked.

1818
01:43:02,623 --> 01:43:16,045
LAURA: I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid
still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?

1819
01:43:16,045 --> 01:43:19,208
TRAVIS: Well, we woke it up.

1820
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,429
LAURA: I know.

1821
01:43:20,429 --> 01:43:21,955
LIAM: But now it's awake, so--

1822
01:43:21,955 --> 01:43:27,165
MATT: Percy shot-- No, actually, you didn't do
your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we

1823
01:43:27,165 --> 01:43:29,008
skipped Scanlan.

1824
01:43:29,008 --> 01:43:34,562
SAM: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the
brain?

1825
01:43:34,562 --> 01:43:37,317
LIAM: If you can also flee at the same time.

1826
01:43:37,317 --> 01:43:39,429
ORION: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.

1827
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:45,465
SAM: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the
pool? Is that big scaffolding still

1828
01:43:45,465 --> 01:43:47,312
hanging over it?

1829
01:43:47,312 --> 01:43:50,489
MATT: It's currently dangling over to this side.
Because it's been busted from three different

1830
01:43:50,489 --> 01:43:52,694
corners and it's precariously hanging.

1831
01:43:52,694 --> 01:43:55,779
SAM: But it's not right over the thing?

1832
01:43:55,779 --> 01:43:57,928
LAURA: But it might fall and tip.

1833
01:43:57,928 --> 01:44:00,430
SAM: Or it could not.

1834
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:06,197
ASHLEY: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to
pull it to fall the other way?

1835
01:44:06,197 --> 01:44:09,722
ORION: I do not have the necessary item to do two
concentration spells at once.

1836
01:44:09,722 --> 01:44:11,469
SAM: Is it super heavy?

1837
01:44:11,469 --> 01:44:18,127
MATT: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close
to 700 to 1,000 pounds.

1838
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:19,302
MARISHA: What does?

1839
01:44:19,302 --> 01:44:22,255
MATT: The giant brass structure.

1840
01:44:22,255 --> 01:44:29,223
SAM: And how high above it is it? Like, would it
get a significant amount of force?

1841
01:44:29,268 --> 01:44:31,765
MATT: It would fall down and then topple over.

1842
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,409
SAM: Unless I made it fall--

1843
01:44:33,409 --> 01:44:35,633
MATT: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll
see.

1844
01:44:35,633 --> 01:44:39,171
SAM: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike?
Okay.

1845
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:41,165
LIAM: It's your decision.

1846
01:44:41,165 --> 01:44:42,544
MARISHA: Go bold!

1847
01:44:42,544 --> 01:44:43,986
TRAVIS: Do what you were going to do. Do it.

1848
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:47,615
SAM: I'm feeling handsy.

1849
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:50,206
(laughter)

1850
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:58,389
SAM: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand
and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing

1851
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:03,938
that's holding it up, but in the direction of
the--

1852
01:45:03,938 --> 01:45:05,431
MATT: Okay!

1853
01:45:05,502 --> 01:45:06,595
SAM: Of the brain.

1854
01:45:06,595 --> 01:45:10,941
MATT: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus
five for your casting ability.

1855
01:45:10,992 --> 01:45:13,290
SAM: Well, that's not good.

1856
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:14,664
ORION: And inspiration!

1857
01:45:14,664 --> 01:45:18,892
SAM: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus
what?

1858
01:45:18,892 --> 01:45:21,666
MATT: 13 plus five, which is your charisma.

1859
01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:23,822
SAM: Okay, then 18.

1860
01:45:23,822 --> 01:45:30,916
MATT: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches
over and grabs the top of the structure, you can

1861
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:35,462
see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part
of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it

1862
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:43,472
aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking)
wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure

1863
01:45:43,472 --> 01:45:45,576
begins to be pulled at an angle.

1864
01:45:45,576 --> 01:45:49,526
SAM: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.

1865
01:45:49,526 --> 01:45:54,735
MATT: It slams down at an angle into the side of
the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even

1866
01:45:54,735 --> 01:46:01,869
further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared
across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6

1867
01:46:01,869 --> 01:46:07,462
force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this
heavy thing jams itself into the brain.

1868
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:09,794
LIAM: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.

1869
01:46:09,794 --> 01:46:12,088
SAM: Orion's my dice bimbo.

1870
01:46:12,088 --> 01:46:14,697
ORION: Here you go, boss.

1871
01:46:14,697 --> 01:46:17,326
ASHLEY: There you go, boss!

1872
01:46:17,326 --> 01:46:18,768
SAM: 16.

1873
01:46:18,768 --> 01:46:26,050
MATT: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder
Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish

1874
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:30,173
black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for
the first time you can see a part of the brain is

1875
01:46:30,173 --> 01:46:34,985
actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you
see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now

1876
01:46:34,985 --> 01:46:39,357
visible from the interior. You can see now, it's
taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind

1877
01:46:39,357 --> 01:46:43,720
flayers that were floating up look down, freaked
out, and begin moving towards the brain now,

1878
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,863
instinctively, to defend it.

1879
01:46:45,863 --> 01:46:52,224
SAM: And bonus action, can I pour some superior
healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?

1880
01:46:52,224 --> 01:46:53,406
MATT: You can.

1881
01:46:53,406 --> 01:46:55,870
(laughter)

1882
01:46:55,870 --> 01:47:03,792
MATT: I'm not going anywhere with that.

1883
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,539
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

1884
01:47:05,539 --> 01:47:08,900
SAM: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's
throat.

1885
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:13,251
MATT: Anyway. All right, so Vex, what're you
doing?

1886
01:47:13,251 --> 01:47:15,623
SAM: I don't know what superior is.

1887
01:47:15,623 --> 01:47:20,515
MATT: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to,
it's 8d4 plus eight.

1888
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:23,298
SAM: Do I roll or does she?

1889
01:47:23,298 --> 01:47:24,178
MATT: You roll.

1890
01:47:24,178 --> 01:47:24,955
SAM: Oh!

1891
01:47:24,955 --> 01:47:25,722
MATT: It's your potion.

1892
01:47:25,722 --> 01:47:26,825
SAM: 8d4 plus eight.

1893
01:47:26,825 --> 01:47:27,503
MATT: Yeah.

1894
01:47:27,503 --> 01:47:29,367
SAM: Holy bajeez. One.

1895
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:33,931
MATT: Five, nine, 13.

1896
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:40,050
SAM and MATT: 15, 18, 21.

1897
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,496
MATT: One more.

1898
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:42,813
SAM: 22.

1899
01:47:42,813 --> 01:47:44,984
MATT: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points.

1900
01:47:44,984 --> 01:47:47,554
ASHLEY: What? Awesome.

1901
01:47:47,554 --> 01:47:49,447
SAM: I got some good potion.

1902
01:47:49,447 --> 01:48:01,189
MATT: Very, very expensive potion used. All right,
so. Vex? You're on Trinket still, do you want to

1903
01:48:01,189 --> 01:48:04,208
hold your action and wait for the rest of the
carpet, do you want to attack anyone, what do you

1904
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,244
want to do?

1905
01:48:05,244 --> 01:48:06,350
LAURA: I want to attack the Elder Brain.

1906
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:07,542
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

1907
01:48:07,542 --> 01:48:12,493
LAURA: I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a
Conjure Barrage.

1908
01:48:12,493 --> 01:48:13,897
MATT: Okay.

1909
01:48:13,897 --> 01:48:16,264
LAURA: So it's the cone of attack.

1910
01:48:16,264 --> 01:48:17,436
MATT: Yeah.

1911
01:48:17,436 --> 01:48:22,466
LAURA: So that will get hopefully all the things,
because I'm shooting down, right?

1912
01:48:22,466 --> 01:48:23,977
MATT: Well, how big is the cone?

1913
01:48:23,977 --> 01:48:25,193
LAURA: It's 60 feet.

1914
01:48:25,193 --> 01:48:30,349
MATT: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're
going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe,

1915
01:48:30,349 --> 01:48:32,130
as a cone that goes down this way.

1916
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:33,133
LAURA: Okay.

1917
01:48:33,133 --> 01:48:34,851
MATT: Unless you want to go this way and hit these
guys, or this guy.

1918
01:48:34,851 --> 01:48:36,309
LIAM: You could get the edge of the brain.

1919
01:48:36,309 --> 01:48:38,046
LAURA: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and
get--

1920
01:48:38,046 --> 01:48:40,915
MATT: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably
these guys there.

1921
01:48:40,915 --> 01:48:41,802
LAURA: All right, let's do that.

1922
01:48:41,802 --> 01:48:42,856
MATT: All right.

1923
01:48:42,856 --> 01:48:44,217
LAURA: Okay.

1924
01:48:44,217 --> 01:48:46,604
MATT: So they get saving throws, right? How
does that work?

1925
01:48:46,604 --> 01:48:47,973
LAURA: Yes, they get saving throws.

1926
01:48:47,973 --> 01:48:51,786
MATT: So roll damage, and we'll see what their
saving throws are.

1927
01:48:51,947 --> 01:48:56,434
LAURA: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it
hits, or it just hits?

1928
01:48:56,487 --> 01:48:58,771
MATT: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and
they get to roll a saving throw against it.

1929
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:07,320
LAURA: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?

1930
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,108
MATT: All right.

1931
01:49:09,108 --> 01:49:11,127
LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.

1932
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:13,838
MATT: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional
damage.

1933
01:49:13,838 --> 01:49:21,458
LAURA: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the
bracers on that Conjure Barrage?

1934
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:23,392
MATT: Technically, yes you would, because they're
ranged.

1935
01:49:23,392 --> 01:49:25,044
LAURA: Okay, so that would've been 19.

1936
01:49:25,044 --> 01:49:31,771
MATT: 19. All right. Cool. And then this guy fails
its save, so total damage on him?

1937
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:33,913
LAURA: 19.

1938
01:49:33,913 --> 01:49:39,339
MATT: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just
looking really, really rough. The brain's just now

1939
01:49:39,339 --> 01:49:44,760
pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's
barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the

1940
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:51,371
troll also takes the damage as well, just seems
to shrug it off, just seems to angrily-- roars up

1941
01:49:51,422 --> 01:49:55,420
from the bottom of the temple at you, now
seemingly helpless in the current circumstance.

1942
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,357
LAURA: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain
again.

1943
01:49:57,357 --> 01:50:00,376
MATT: All right. So you release it down.

1944
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:02,330
LAURA: 20.

1945
01:50:02,407 --> 01:50:04,879
MATT: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll
damage.

1946
01:50:04,879 --> 01:50:07,979
LAURA: All right. 11.

1947
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:09,823
MATT: 11 points of damage, all right.

1948
01:50:09,823 --> 01:50:13,041
LAURA: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.

1949
01:50:13,041 --> 01:50:14,426
MATT: 13, okay, there we go.

1950
01:50:14,426 --> 01:50:16,170
TRAVIS: (laughs) No, lies.

1951
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:20,477
MATT: (laughs) Reach down again, release this one,
aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side

1952
01:50:20,477 --> 01:50:25,880
of the Elder Brain as the arrow now sinks in,
there's another pulse of purple energy, and you

1953
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:30,414
hear, all of you simultaneously in your heads this
scream, this screech (screech) that echoes through

1954
01:50:30,414 --> 01:50:35,984
your heads. As it does, the two illithid that were
hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily

1955
01:50:35,984 --> 01:50:38,390
out of frustration and glare up at you angrily.

1956
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:41,279
ORION: Ooh! I took notice of this.

1957
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:43,386
MATT: That brings us to Keyleth.

1958
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:47,961
MARISHA: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow
speed to get up to the top.

1959
01:50:47,961 --> 01:50:49,138
MATT: All right.

1960
01:50:49,138 --> 01:50:50,426
MARISHA: I'm assuming I'm there?

1961
01:50:50,426 --> 01:50:51,712
MATT: You just manage to make it to the top of the
temple, yeah.

1962
01:50:51,712 --> 01:50:53,862
MARISHA: Okay. Drop earth elemental.

1963
01:50:53,862 --> 01:50:56,076
MATT: All right. Keyleth is on the field.

1964
01:50:56,076 --> 01:50:58,668
MARISHA: Would you say--

1965
01:50:58,668 --> 01:51:00,754
SAM: Oh boy.

1966
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:02,877
(laughter)

1967
01:51:02,877 --> 01:51:05,482
MATT: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do
you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?

1968
01:51:05,482 --> 01:51:06,991
MARISHA: Theoretically.

1969
01:51:06,991 --> 01:51:08,477
MATT: Theoretically?

1970
01:51:08,477 --> 01:51:22,545
MARISHA: Our brains are made up of water, right?
Would you say that there is water in the like

1971
01:51:22,545 --> 01:51:26,972
jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in
it?

1972
01:51:26,972 --> 01:51:28,884
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1973
01:51:28,884 --> 01:51:34,932
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know much in terms of
arcana, but I can try. Ten.

1974
01:51:34,932 --> 01:51:40,347
MATT: You have no idea. You have never encountered
an Elder Brain before.

1975
01:51:40,347 --> 01:51:41,761
LAURA: Yeah, give it a try!

1976
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:43,152
TALIESIN: Give it a try!

1977
01:51:43,152 --> 01:51:51,102
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water.
I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300

1978
01:51:51,102 --> 01:51:56,473
feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the
brain where it's already kind of sliced down the

1979
01:51:56,473 --> 01:51:59,970
middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm
going to take it and I'm

1980
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:02,134
just going to rip it apart.

1981
01:52:02,134 --> 01:52:05,639
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
wisdom modifier to it.

1982
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:07,293
MARISHA: Okay.

1983
01:52:07,293 --> 01:52:09,847
TRAVIS: Wait, you're saying brains are made of
water?

1984
01:52:09,847 --> 01:52:13,323
TALIESIN: Whoa!

1985
01:52:13,323 --> 01:52:17,495
MARISHA: 23.

1986
01:52:17,495 --> 01:52:27,589
MATT: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its
structure, however it is difficult to extract it

1987
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:31,394
from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone
one that's this stable. You manage to find a way

1988
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:38,999
to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually
deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel

1989
01:52:38,999 --> 01:52:45,504
sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You
do 3d6 points of dehydration damage.

1990
01:52:45,504 --> 01:52:46,974
MARISHA: I'll take it, I'll take it.

1991
01:52:46,974 --> 01:52:48,590
ASHLEY: Make some brain jerky.

1992
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:52,393
MARISHA: They'll have a really bad hangover
tomorrow.

1993
01:52:52,393 --> 01:52:56,910
MATT: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of
it.

1994
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:59,104
MARISHA: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?

1995
01:52:59,104 --> 01:53:00,141
MATT: Just 3d6.

1996
01:53:00,141 --> 01:53:02,354
MARISHA: 15.

1997
01:53:02,354 --> 01:53:06,580
MATT: 15, all right. 15 points of dehydration
damage to the Elder Brain. You can see now the

1998
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:11,502
portion of the wound that's been opened, the
corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and

1999
01:53:11,502 --> 01:53:19,788
the actual purple glow in the inside dulls
slightly. And you now have, currently, in the air,

2000
01:53:19,788 --> 01:53:26,305
a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's
just kind of floating there in this, in the air.

2001
01:53:26,305 --> 01:53:28,644
ASHLEY: Awesome.
LAURA: Gross.
MARISHA: Cool.

2002
01:53:28,644 --> 01:53:32,749
(laughter)

2003
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:34,369
MARISHA: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!

2004
01:53:34,369 --> 01:53:35,252
SAM: No, thank you.

2005
01:53:35,252 --> 01:53:36,098
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

2006
01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:42,439
ORION: Did you say there was illithid coming up on
the sides, too?

2007
01:53:42,494 --> 01:53:44,920
MATT: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're
probably about halfway up.

2008
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:52,076
ORION: Okay. I turn to the group. I suggest we go
to the beach immediately. There we can shore up

2009
01:53:52,145 --> 01:53:56,265
defenses and I can cast a spell and get us out of
here. As I say that, I go (fwwt) and throw a

2010
01:53:56,265 --> 01:53:58,004
Fireball right at that fucker's head.

2011
01:53:58,004 --> 01:54:00,906
MATT: Okay. Are you using your movement to bring
the carpet, to take control of the carpet from

2012
01:54:00,906 --> 01:54:03,558
Percy and move it up higher?

2013
01:54:03,558 --> 01:54:04,844
ORION: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.

2014
01:54:04,844 --> 01:54:07,056
MATT: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. All right,
so.

2015
01:54:07,056 --> 01:54:08,437
ORION: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the
brain.

2016
01:54:08,437 --> 01:54:19,448
MATT: Into the brain, all right. All right, so
that's enough to get both of these guys. Go ahead

2017
01:54:19,531 --> 01:54:26,336
and roll damage. And they both failed their save,
so full damage.

2018
01:54:26,391 --> 01:54:27,686
TRAVIS: Crush the nuts.

2019
01:54:27,686 --> 01:54:34,918
ASHLEY: Little brains.

2020
01:54:34,918 --> 01:54:36,487
MATT: I like that, good.

2021
01:54:36,487 --> 01:54:37,273
ORION: 40.

2022
01:54:37,273 --> 01:54:37,919
MATT: 40?

2023
01:54:37,919 --> 01:54:38,735
LAURA: Whoa!

2024
01:54:38,735 --> 01:54:39,591
ASHLEY: Yeah!

2025
01:54:39,591 --> 01:54:48,476
MATT: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to
the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion

2026
01:54:48,658 --> 01:54:52,468
blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you
are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and

2027
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:59,584
yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a
sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible

2028
01:54:59,587 --> 01:55:03,737
burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that
was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and

2029
01:55:03,737 --> 01:55:12,145
singed. You can see now, it's looking a little
rougher and it's very very unhappy with its

2030
01:55:12,218 --> 01:55:13,987
current circumstance.

2031
01:55:13,987 --> 01:55:15,662
LAURA: I want to kill it before we leave now.

2032
01:55:15,662 --> 01:55:19,590
MATT: All right. Pike, go ahead and make a saving
throw.

2033
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:21,316
MARISHA: Come on, Pike!

2034
01:55:21,316 --> 01:55:22,467
LAURA: Why a saving throw?

2035
01:55:22,467 --> 01:55:23,845
MATT: Still trying to get rid of the stun.

2036
01:55:23,845 --> 01:55:25,016
LAURA: Oh, right.

2037
01:55:25,016 --> 01:55:26,188
MATT: So intellect saving throw.

2038
01:55:26,188 --> 01:55:27,187
ASHLEY: 16?

2039
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:29,017
MATT: 16. You shrug off the effect--

2040
01:55:29,017 --> 01:55:33,299
ASHLEY: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better
now.

2041
01:55:33,299 --> 01:55:34,464
MARISHA: New dice!

2042
01:55:34,464 --> 01:55:37,774
SAM: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole
time.

2043
01:55:37,774 --> 01:55:41,806
ASHLEY: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?

2044
01:55:41,806 --> 01:55:43,048
MATT: That's your turn.

2045
01:55:43,048 --> 01:55:46,496
ORION: My movement, by the way is I head to the
beach.

2046
01:55:46,496 --> 01:55:48,228
SAM: You're ghosting?

2047
01:55:48,228 --> 01:55:49,159
ORION: Yes.

2048
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:51,326
MATT: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius
is that way.

2049
01:55:51,326 --> 01:55:53,039
ASHLEY: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?

2050
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:55,330
LAURA: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it
comes up.

2051
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:56,455
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, got it.

2052
01:55:56,455 --> 01:55:57,720
MARISHA: Classic Tiberius.

2053
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,422
TALIESIN: All right, here's a question: can
everybody still fly?

2054
01:55:59,422 --> 01:56:00,498
MATT: Vax?

2055
01:56:00,498 --> 01:56:01,999
ORION: As long as I'm thinking about it.

2056
01:56:01,999 --> 01:56:05,828
LIAM: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on
the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing

2057
01:56:05,828 --> 01:56:07,397
daggers at the bacon brain.

2058
01:56:07,397 --> 01:56:10,242
MATT: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this
distance.

2059
01:56:10,242 --> 01:56:15,514
LIAM: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the
first.

2060
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:19,851
MATT: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by
the arcane shield on the brain.

2061
01:56:19,851 --> 01:56:23,275
LIAM: All right, so then the second one does as
well, and the last one definitely does, so.

2062
01:56:23,275 --> 01:56:25,835
MATT: Yeah, so all three just (ping, ping, ping).

2063
01:56:25,835 --> 01:56:27,214
TALIESIN: Take the wheel!

2064
01:56:27,214 --> 01:56:29,691
MATT: As it gets more and more damaged, it's
waking up more and more and it looks like it's

2065
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:33,018
actually gaining power the more it does.

2066
01:56:33,018 --> 01:56:35,767
LIAM: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I
take some of the little carpet tassels.

2067
01:56:35,823 --> 01:56:42,125
MATT: (laughs) Okay. So as your movement, you
manage to move the carpet all the way up, it

2068
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:44,565
swoops up into the center of--

2069
01:56:44,565 --> 01:56:45,805
LAURA: Grab the gnomes!

2070
01:56:45,805 --> 01:56:50,770
MATT: This right here. You guys are all looking
precariously at this carpet that is now floating

2071
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:54,420
up from the center of the temple. As you get to
the top, you look over and you can see there's

2072
01:56:54,420 --> 01:57:06,252
probably close to 20 mind flayers that are
swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax,

2073
01:57:06,252 --> 01:57:07,336
Percy, you're up.

2074
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:13,707
TALIESIN: All right, I pull out Bad News. And I'm
going to lie down on my stomach, hanging off the

2075
01:57:13,707 --> 01:57:15,254
edge of the carpet.

2076
01:57:15,254 --> 01:57:16,933
SAM: Hanging brain!

2077
01:57:16,933 --> 01:57:18,636
TALIESIN: And I'm taking a shot straight down.

2078
01:57:18,636 --> 01:57:22,509
MATT: Okay. I'll say it takes you your--

2079
01:57:22,509 --> 01:57:23,721
TALIESIN: My movement.

2080
01:57:23,721 --> 01:57:27,791
MATT: Movement to get it out. So you're there,
you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad

2081
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:30,918
News out, you get down, you're precariously off
the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight

2082
01:57:30,918 --> 01:57:33,853
touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire.

2083
01:57:33,853 --> 01:57:35,217
TALIESIN: Firing a deadshot.

2084
01:57:35,217 --> 01:57:36,596
MATT: Okay.

2085
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:37,883
MARISHA: Oh, come on.

2086
01:57:37,883 --> 01:57:39,843
TALIESIN: That's 18.

2087
01:57:39,843 --> 01:57:47,431
MATT: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost
onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear

2088
01:57:47,431 --> 01:57:55,129
this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast
hitting stone as the psychic field around it

2089
01:57:55,129 --> 01:57:58,035
deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground.

2090
01:57:58,035 --> 01:58:02,093
LAURA: I thought 18 was the number that we were
aiming for-- shit.

2091
01:58:02,093 --> 01:58:04,752
TALIESIN: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice
from last-- fuck.

2092
01:58:04,824 --> 01:58:05,727
ORION: You did.

2093
01:58:05,727 --> 01:58:10,522
TALIESIN: I did have an inspiration dice from last
game! I did! What do you give people with it?

2094
01:58:10,522 --> 01:58:11,605
SAM: d10.

2095
01:58:11,605 --> 01:58:12,832
TALIESIN: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.

2096
01:58:12,832 --> 01:58:14,113
ORION: Can he add it now?

2097
01:58:14,113 --> 01:58:15,297
MATT: Yeah, I'll trust you on that.

2098
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:18,135
TALIESIN: I did! I did, because I'm always excited
when I get them, because I never get them.

2099
01:58:18,135 --> 01:58:20,426
MATT: That's true, okay, yeah. All right. Go ahead
and roll for that.

2100
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:21,813
TALIESIN: 21!

2101
01:58:21,813 --> 01:58:22,789
MATT: That'll do it.

2102
01:58:22,789 --> 01:58:24,250
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

2103
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:30,130
MATT: As the brain continues to wake up, it
improves its defenses, improves its

2104
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:30,987
capabilities--

2105
01:58:30,987 --> 01:58:31,982
LAURA: Oh, I understand.

2106
01:58:31,982 --> 01:58:32,896
TALIESIN: Okay.

2107
01:58:32,896 --> 01:58:34,360
MATT: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll
damage on that.

2108
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,313
TALIESIN: Okay.

2109
01:58:35,313 --> 01:58:36,662
ORION: It's Hulking?

2110
01:58:36,662 --> 01:58:42,833
MATT: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it
hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear

2111
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:46,058
is it hitting the psychic field and pushing
through into the actual brain matter.

2112
01:58:46,114 --> 01:58:47,657
MARISHA: Come on!

2113
01:58:47,657 --> 01:58:55,798
TALIESIN: Let me double-check that I'm doing this
right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon

2114
01:58:55,798 --> 01:59:05,399
damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12,
13... 25 points of damage.

2115
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:11,153
MATT: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the
section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets

2116
01:59:11,209 --> 01:59:15,790
blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain
that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish

2117
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:19,681
glow on the inside is pulsing more and more
angrily. It's taken a beating, but

2118
01:59:19,681 --> 01:59:20,820
it's hanging in there.

2119
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,106
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

2120
01:59:22,106 --> 01:59:23,915
MARISHA: Will not die.

2121
01:59:23,915 --> 01:59:29,723
MATT: This is, you guys have left a good mark on
it. You get the sensation, with the swarming

2122
01:59:29,723 --> 01:59:35,779
incoming, you may start to consider
self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like

2123
01:59:35,779 --> 01:59:38,451
it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's
door yet.

2124
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,527
TALIESIN: Oh god.

2125
01:59:39,527 --> 01:59:40,662
MARISHA: Let's get out.

2126
01:59:40,662 --> 01:59:41,569
LAURA: We need to go.

2127
01:59:41,569 --> 01:59:42,446
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

2128
01:59:42,446 --> 01:59:43,490
SAM: Scanlan is up?

2129
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:44,211
MATT: Yep.

2130
01:59:44,211 --> 01:59:45,305
SAM: We're out of here?

2131
01:59:45,305 --> 01:59:47,099
TALIESIN: We need everybody to hop on the carpet
first.

2132
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:47,900
SAM: Okay.

2133
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,336
MATT: You're hopping up?

2134
01:59:49,336 --> 01:59:54,418
SAM: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl
and carry some folks.

2135
01:59:54,418 --> 01:59:55,838
MATT: Okay.

2136
01:59:55,838 --> 01:59:56,644
TRAVIS: What?

2137
01:59:56,644 --> 01:59:58,195
LAURA: You can do that?

2138
01:59:58,195 --> 01:59:59,109
SAM: Sure, why not?

2139
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,569
MARISHA: He's got Polymorph.

2140
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,104
TRAVIS: Yeah, turn into a batwing.

2141
02:00:03,165 --> 02:00:07,647
MATT: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll
use this as Scanlan.

2142
02:00:07,647 --> 02:00:09,006
SAM: Great.

2143
02:00:09,006 --> 02:00:14,195
MATT: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that
you've read in books in the past, you haven't

2144
02:00:14,195 --> 02:00:16,873
actually seen in person. And what are you doing?

2145
02:00:16,873 --> 02:00:18,728
SAM: Who can I carry?

2146
02:00:18,728 --> 02:00:22,374
MATT: You can carry one person with your claws.
You haven't used this form before, and this is you

2147
02:00:22,374 --> 02:00:24,801
figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them
with you.

2148
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:29,433
SAM: I'm going to take someone heavy.

2149
02:00:29,433 --> 02:00:30,915
LIAM: Grog.

2150
02:00:30,915 --> 02:00:31,950
MATT: Grog can fly.

2151
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:35,548
LAURA: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's
covered, man.

2152
02:00:35,548 --> 02:00:37,468
SAM: There's only one person I can take.

2153
02:00:37,468 --> 02:00:48,094
MATT: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and
both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you

2154
02:00:48,094 --> 02:00:51,256
off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius.

2155
02:00:51,256 --> 02:00:53,719
TALIESIN: How do you make that weird?

2156
02:00:53,719 --> 02:01:04,291
MATT: All right, so they're now out of harm's way.
Very top of the round, that brings us to Grog.

2157
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:06,763
Still carrying Kima under your arm.

2158
02:01:06,763 --> 02:01:08,070
TRAVIS: We're getting out, right?

2159
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:08,905
LAURA: Yeah.

2160
02:01:08,905 --> 02:01:10,209
TRAVIS: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.

2161
02:01:10,209 --> 02:01:13,069
MATT: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under
your arm, off with the rest of the group.

2162
02:01:13,069 --> 02:01:16,270
LIAM: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.

2163
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:20,701
SAM: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful
pterodactyl.

2164
02:01:20,701 --> 02:01:27,402
MATT: We'll get these guys off the board here
because you do have two Illithid that get up to

2165
02:01:27,402 --> 02:01:31,329
the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind
Blast.

2166
02:01:31,412 --> 02:01:33,340
LIAM: We're gone, man, we're gone!

2167
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:34,457
LAURA: Not yet.

2168
02:01:34,457 --> 02:01:37,095
MATT: Still holding back. So--

2169
02:01:37,095 --> 02:01:38,671
LIAM: I jump up to get out of range.

2170
02:01:38,671 --> 02:01:46,655
MATT: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you
can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw

2171
02:01:46,655 --> 02:01:47,995
for both of you.

2172
02:01:47,995 --> 02:01:49,886
LIAM: Don't fuck with my sister.

2173
02:01:49,886 --> 02:01:53,165
ORION: Trinket and Vex are still there?

2174
02:01:53,165 --> 02:01:56,550
LAURA: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to--

2175
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:57,733
SAM: They never flew.

2176
02:01:57,733 --> 02:01:59,724
LAURA: I know, I didn't use the movement on the
last turn.

2177
02:01:59,724 --> 02:02:00,670
MATT: Nope.

2178
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:03,503
LAURA: I just didn't say it because I'm an
asshole.

2179
02:02:03,743 --> 02:02:05,050
SAM: You are.

2180
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:07,612
LIAM: What kind of saving throw?

2181
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:08,995
MATT and SAM: Intelligence.

2182
02:02:08,995 --> 02:02:11,549
LAURA: Ten? On me.

2183
02:02:11,549 --> 02:02:13,481
MATT: Okay. Roll for Trinket.

2184
02:02:13,481 --> 02:02:14,907
LIAM: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.

2185
02:02:14,907 --> 02:02:17,171
LAURA: Oh. Okay. 11.

2186
02:02:17,171 --> 02:02:18,440
MATT: So go ahead and roll for Trinket.

2187
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,871
LAURA: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.

2188
02:02:19,871 --> 02:02:21,220
LIAM: For what?

2189
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,712
LAURA: For my ring that I'm wearing.

2190
02:02:22,712 --> 02:02:23,493
LIAM: Okay.

2191
02:02:23,493 --> 02:02:24,384
LAURA: So whatever that was.

2192
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:24,982
MATT: Okay.

2193
02:02:24,982 --> 02:02:25,908
LAURA and LIAM: 13.

2194
02:02:25,908 --> 02:02:26,656
MATT: Okay.

2195
02:02:26,656 --> 02:02:27,413
LAURA: For me.

2196
02:02:27,413 --> 02:02:28,505
MATT: And roll for Trinket.

2197
02:02:28,505 --> 02:02:31,768
LAURA: Which is going to be a major fail because
Trinket is the dumbest.

2198
02:02:31,768 --> 02:02:33,442
(laughter)

2199
02:02:33,442 --> 02:02:35,028
SAM: Don't talk about Trinket like that.

2200
02:02:35,028 --> 02:02:36,370
TRAVIS: Is he the dumbest?

2201
02:02:36,370 --> 02:02:46,268
LAURA: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a
nine for Trinket.

2202
02:02:46,268 --> 02:02:47,868
MATT: Nine for Trinket.

2203
02:02:47,868 --> 02:02:54,495
LAURA: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out
of here right now.

2204
02:02:54,495 --> 02:03:01,875
MATT: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze
in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto

2205
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:07,786
the top of the temple, limply laying across the
edge, about to tip over off the temple.

2206
02:03:07,859 --> 02:03:10,644
SAM: (whispering) Told you we should've left
Trinket behind.

2207
02:03:10,718 --> 02:03:15,918
MATT: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

2208
02:03:15,918 --> 02:03:17,869
MARISHA: Okay.

2209
02:03:17,869 --> 02:03:23,686
LIAM: A lot of Sandmen in there.

2210
02:03:23,742 --> 02:03:27,632
MARISHA: Well first and foremost I'm going to get
on the carpet.

2211
02:03:27,686 --> 02:03:30,266
MATT: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys.

2212
02:03:30,266 --> 02:03:43,916
MARISHA: Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait,
Trinket's stunned?

2213
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:50,907
MATT: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just
barely holding herself right there. You can see

2214
02:03:50,907 --> 02:03:54,798
she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's
kind of levering herself into the ground--

2215
02:03:54,798 --> 02:03:56,298
LAURA: Trinket's a boy.

2216
02:03:56,298 --> 02:03:57,967
MATT: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you.

2217
02:03:57,967 --> 02:04:01,760
LAURA: If he's about to die, at least get his
gender right.

2218
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:06,615
MATT: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry.

2219
02:04:06,688 --> 02:04:07,887
MARISHA: Wait, shove him?

2220
02:04:07,887 --> 02:04:09,107
TALIESIN: Shove him onto the carpet.

2221
02:04:09,107 --> 02:04:10,272
MARISHA: No, I can't shove him.

2222
02:04:10,272 --> 02:04:11,830
SAM: Wait, he's floating.

2223
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:18,835
MARISHA: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what
I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to

2224
02:04:18,835 --> 02:04:28,647
cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around
Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.

2225
02:04:28,647 --> 02:04:30,266
MATT: Okay.

2226
02:04:30,266 --> 02:04:31,933
ORION: Like the Macy's Day parade!

2227
02:04:31,933 --> 02:04:39,082
MATT: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach
down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was

2228
02:04:39,082 --> 02:04:43,082
originally made from, you manage to pull the
essence of that out to create a vine of similarly

2229
02:04:43,082 --> 02:04:51,060
patterned color of the actual magic carpet
material. The various silks form into this tendril

2230
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:55,939
that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls
you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys

2231
02:04:55,939 --> 02:04:58,115
are essentially now towed to the carpet.

2232
02:04:58,115 --> 02:04:59,410
MARISHA: Let's go!

2233
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:00,942
ORION: Can she take control of the carpet, too?

2234
02:05:00,942 --> 02:05:03,385
MARISHA: Can I now use the rest of my movement
to be like--

2235
02:05:03,385 --> 02:05:07,591
MATT: You currently do not have control of the
carpet because you used your action and everything

2236
02:05:07,668 --> 02:05:09,013
to use that spell and your concentration at that
point.

2237
02:05:09,013 --> 02:05:13,576
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just holding.

2238
02:05:13,576 --> 02:05:16,011
MATT: You're just holding them there. That brings
us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is

2239
02:05:16,086 --> 02:05:17,411
off, Vax, you're up.

2240
02:05:17,411 --> 02:05:19,411
LIAM: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.

2241
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:29,878
MATT: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you
guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the

2242
02:05:29,878 --> 02:05:35,674
illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or
so get to the front top here, look down at the

2243
02:05:35,674 --> 02:05:40,129
Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this
angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes

2244
02:05:40,129 --> 02:05:45,467
adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look
down and you swear you can see hundreds and

2245
02:05:45,467 --> 02:05:50,245
hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just
staring up from the city as you all slowly fly

2246
02:05:50,245 --> 02:05:56,101
away to the far end of the cavern. As you're
moving, so are the eyes.

2247
02:05:56,101 --> 02:05:59,924
LAURA: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're
coming after us.

2248
02:05:59,924 --> 02:06:03,924
ORION: I want to make a note, because I'm way
ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I

2249
02:06:03,924 --> 02:06:05,713
land on the beach, I cast Circle of
Teleportation.

2250
02:06:05,945 --> 02:06:07,161
MATT: Okay.

2251
02:06:07,161 --> 02:06:10,883
ORION: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do
that immediately.

2252
02:06:10,883 --> 02:06:15,972
MATT: All right, so. A few minutes go by, you guys
are moving past and over the water channel that's

2253
02:06:15,972 --> 02:06:20,470
between the north side of the island and the beach
where you guys previously set.

2254
02:06:20,541 --> 02:06:24,199
(laughter)

2255
02:06:24,199 --> 02:06:32,064
MATT: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land,
immediately begin casting the Circle of

2256
02:06:32,064 --> 02:06:35,783
Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on
the ground, running your finger across the gravel

2257
02:06:35,783 --> 02:06:39,338
surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag
across, you can see the arcane light beginning to

2258
02:06:39,338 --> 02:06:43,607
glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're
drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group

2259
02:06:43,607 --> 02:06:50,828
eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds
into it. As you all eventually get back, you and

2260
02:06:50,871 --> 02:06:55,132
Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you
find yourselves halfway through being towed by

2261
02:06:55,132 --> 02:06:56,614
this vine awkwardly.

2262
02:06:56,614 --> 02:06:58,922
LAURA: What is happening right now?

2263
02:06:58,922 --> 02:07:00,399
MARISHA: Stupid wrench.

2264
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:04,908
MATT: A few seconds pass, you finish the
incantation, you place your hand down on the

2265
02:07:04,908 --> 02:07:10,270
center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy
blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this

2266
02:07:10,270 --> 02:07:16,448
tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the
ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway

2267
02:07:16,448 --> 02:07:20,440
opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on
the side of the beach.

2268
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:24,025
ORION: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose
Emon!

2269
02:07:24,025 --> 02:07:30,375
MATT: At which point, the doorway that he just
created takes some sort of a solid form and from

2270
02:07:30,557 --> 02:07:34,402
what you can see on the other side, there appears
to be some sort of low-lit room.

2271
02:07:34,402 --> 02:07:35,254
LIAM: Greyskull!

2272
02:07:35,254 --> 02:07:36,141
LAURA: (gasps) Greyskull!

2273
02:07:36,141 --> 02:07:37,153
ORION: I run right through.

2274
02:07:37,153 --> 02:07:38,848
MATT: All right. Tiberius runs through. Everyone
else?

2275
02:07:38,848 --> 02:07:40,035
ALL: Yes!

2276
02:07:40,035 --> 02:07:41,167
SAM: Are we there?

2277
02:07:41,167 --> 02:07:43,347
MATT: You guys have all landed on the beach as he
finished casting this, yeah.

2278
02:07:43,347 --> 02:07:44,080
LAURA: Run!

2279
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:45,049
MARISHA: Run!

2280
02:07:45,049 --> 02:07:50,172
MATT: You all rush through the portal, one after
the other, towards the very end is Grog, you

2281
02:07:50,172 --> 02:07:53,239
bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing
towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only

2282
02:07:53,239 --> 02:07:58,157
lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as
it closes behind you with a sparking sound.

2283
02:07:58,157 --> 02:07:59,810
TALIESIN: We are time bandits.

2284
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:02,176
(cheering)

2285
02:08:02,233 --> 02:08:08,416
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.

2286
02:08:08,416 --> 02:08:11,299
TALIESIN: Squish-squish.

2287
02:08:11,299 --> 02:08:15,092
LAURA: I hate that phrase.

2288
02:08:15,092 --> 02:08:17,026
ORION: That was something, now, wasn't it?

2289
02:08:17,026 --> 02:08:18,308
TALIESIN: That was fantastic.

2290
02:08:18,308 --> 02:08:19,606
TRAVIS: Chocolate cake.

2291
02:08:19,606 --> 02:08:25,412
MATT: You all emerge within a small
20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all

2292
02:08:25,412 --> 02:08:30,242
are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you
are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway

2293
02:08:30,242 --> 02:08:34,815
closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the
ground there is a similar circle across the stone

2294
02:08:34,815 --> 02:08:40,167
flooring, different patterns, different, you know,
arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with

2295
02:08:40,167 --> 02:08:44,410
some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent
glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade

2296
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:46,325
away, based on what he had drawn previously.

2297
02:08:46,325 --> 02:08:48,196
LAURA: They won't be able to open that back up?

2298
02:08:48,196 --> 02:08:49,100
ORION: We are safe.

2299
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:49,951
LAURA: Okay.

2300
02:08:49,951 --> 02:08:54,333
TRAVIS: Just a quick request: she is made of
stone. Holding Lady Kima.

2301
02:08:54,333 --> 02:08:58,231
ASHLEY: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater
Restoration on Kima.

2302
02:08:58,231 --> 02:09:00,006
ORION: Hold on just one second.

2303
02:09:00,006 --> 02:09:00,957
TRAVIS: Hold on.

2304
02:09:00,957 --> 02:09:03,161
ORION: We still have the Horn to deal with.

2305
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:06,068
TALIESIN: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been
specifically not touched.

2306
02:09:06,068 --> 02:09:09,636
MATT: So it's just kind of sitting there. The
carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind

2307
02:09:09,636 --> 02:09:13,001
of flew into the portal and kind of left it there
and the Horn's just resting there.

2308
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:17,058
ORION: I think we should get it out of her view
before--

2309
02:09:17,058 --> 02:09:18,625
TALIESIN: I think we should put it in the Bag of
Holding.

2310
02:09:18,625 --> 02:09:22,176
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in
the bag?

2311
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,135
ASHLEY: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the
thousand pounds?

2312
02:09:24,135 --> 02:09:25,273
ORION: We can store it there.

2313
02:09:25,273 --> 02:09:28,217
LIAM: Where are we? You said we're in a room.

2314
02:09:28,217 --> 02:09:33,393
MATT: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small
white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish

2315
02:09:33,393 --> 02:09:41,114
brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some
very faint white orbs that are locked into the

2316
02:09:41,114 --> 02:09:47,585
wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now.

2317
02:09:47,585 --> 02:09:49,144
MARISHA: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.

2318
02:09:49,144 --> 02:09:53,358
MATT: You guys don't have a teleportation circle
installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where

2319
02:09:53,358 --> 02:09:54,417
you are.

2320
02:09:54,417 --> 02:09:56,463
SAM: We're in a room right now?

2321
02:09:56,463 --> 02:09:59,281
MATT: You're in a room, you're in a
20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs

2322
02:09:59,281 --> 02:10:02,844
on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to
give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a

2323
02:10:02,844 --> 02:10:05,765
single doorway that exits the room that is
currently closed.

2324
02:10:05,841 --> 02:10:11,307
ORION: The way Circle of Teleportation works is
when I learned it I get to pick two locations that

2325
02:10:11,377 --> 02:10:13,971
I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.

2326
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:15,510
LAURA: Oh, okay. Okay.

2327
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:16,993
MARISHA: So we're somewhere in Emon.

2328
02:10:16,993 --> 02:10:18,264
ORION: But I just had to pick the two.

2329
02:10:18,264 --> 02:10:20,078
MARISHA: So we could be in someone's living room
right now?

2330
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:27,521
ORION: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off
the carpet.

2331
02:10:27,521 --> 02:10:30,063
MATT: Okay. You still have the spells?

2332
02:10:30,063 --> 02:10:33,311
ORION: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.

2333
02:10:33,311 --> 02:10:35,347
LAURA: Should we wrap it at all?

2334
02:10:35,347 --> 02:10:36,867
TALIESIN: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.

2335
02:10:36,867 --> 02:10:43,685
LIAM: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to
go to the door and just inspect it,

2336
02:10:43,685 --> 02:10:45,973
see if it's trapped.

2337
02:10:45,973 --> 02:10:48,683
MATT: Roll a perception check.

2338
02:10:48,683 --> 02:10:52,802
LIAM: 24.

2339
02:10:52,802 --> 02:10:59,106
MATT: 24. All right, the door does appear to be
locked. It is not trapped.

2340
02:10:59,106 --> 02:11:05,556
LIAM: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it,
then. 32.

2341
02:11:05,556 --> 02:11:13,588
MATT: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door
comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very

2342
02:11:13,659 --> 02:11:21,290
intricately carved brass handle that has swirls
upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind

2343
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:25,328
being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and
the door opens slightly.

2344
02:11:25,328 --> 02:11:31,226
LIAM: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I
pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go

2345
02:11:31,226 --> 02:11:37,752
stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32.
And I have a look around outside the door.

2346
02:11:37,752 --> 02:11:43,704
MATT: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into
a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter

2347
02:11:43,704 --> 02:11:49,365
circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge
of a giant circle. There are a series of other

2348
02:11:49,365 --> 02:11:56,802
doors, almost in respective rows next to each
other, and you also see, in the center of the

2349
02:11:56,802 --> 02:12:01,535
room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal
like the spheres you saw in the previous room you

2350
02:12:01,535 --> 02:12:07,064
were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to
the entire room. In the center of the room, there

2351
02:12:07,117 --> 02:12:10,691
is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a
similar white stone material that the rest of the

2352
02:12:10,691 --> 02:12:15,503
room is made out of, with polished gold leaf
trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to

2353
02:12:15,503 --> 02:12:23,493
be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish
gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are

2354
02:12:23,493 --> 02:12:28,123
finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a
desk with a series of books kind of piled up on

2355
02:12:28,123 --> 02:12:35,785
the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks
up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging

2356
02:12:35,785 --> 02:12:42,019
sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open
the door. He looks up for a second.

2357
02:12:42,019 --> 02:12:43,063
LAURA: Say hello.

2358
02:12:43,063 --> 02:12:46,295
LIAM: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull
down the cloak and say, "Hello."

2359
02:12:46,295 --> 02:12:48,841
MATT: "Stay right where you are! Do not move!"

2360
02:12:48,841 --> 02:12:50,253
LIAM: Hands up in the air.

2361
02:12:50,253 --> 02:12:51,144
MATT: "Do not move!"

2362
02:12:51,144 --> 02:12:55,650
LIAM: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here.
A little lost, apparently.

2363
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:56,742
MATT: "Apparently."

2364
02:12:56,742 --> 02:12:57,754
LIAM: Yes.

2365
02:12:57,754 --> 02:13:01,654
MATT: "Who else is in, who else goes there? Who
else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!"

2366
02:13:01,654 --> 02:13:02,579
LIAM: They're--

2367
02:13:02,579 --> 02:13:03,403
LAURA: Hi!

2368
02:13:03,403 --> 02:13:04,112
MARISHA: Hi.

2369
02:13:04,112 --> 02:13:04,791
ASHLEY: Hello.

2370
02:13:04,791 --> 02:13:07,040
SAM: (pterodactyl screech)

2371
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:12,345
MATT: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams).

2372
02:13:12,397 --> 02:13:14,037
ORION: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.

2373
02:13:14,037 --> 02:13:15,328
SAM: Do you have it anymore?

2374
02:13:15,328 --> 02:13:16,159
ORION: Yeah, I do.

2375
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:17,675
SAM: You just did it to me earlier in this round.

2376
02:13:17,675 --> 02:13:20,804
ORION: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this
is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.

2377
02:13:20,804 --> 02:13:23,173
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

2378
02:13:23,299 --> 02:13:24,754
SAM: Oh. Hello.

2379
02:13:24,754 --> 02:13:30,513
MATT: So as you cast the spell and transform, he
stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively

2380
02:13:30,513 --> 02:13:35,160
and goes, "Oh. And a bear. Interesting."

2381
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:36,333
ORION: He's friendly.

2382
02:13:36,333 --> 02:13:37,597
SAM: He's real.

2383
02:13:37,597 --> 02:13:44,350
LIAM: I have a very long, very strange story,
every word of which is true, and if you will give

2384
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:46,992
me five minutes, I swear I can convince you--

2385
02:13:46,992 --> 02:13:48,556
MATT: He opens a book and starts thumbing through
the pages.

2386
02:13:48,556 --> 02:13:50,137
LIAM: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.

2387
02:13:50,137 --> 02:13:55,264
MATT: "We have no expected arrivals at this hour.
I need to know your business, your names, and your

2388
02:13:55,318 --> 02:13:56,708
"affiliations immediately."

2389
02:13:56,708 --> 02:13:59,683
MARISHA: We will totally do that when we know--

2390
02:13:59,683 --> 02:14:01,172
LAURA: We are affiliated with the king.

2391
02:14:01,172 --> 02:14:08,270
LIAM: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox
Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have

2392
02:14:08,336 --> 02:14:10,044
news for him, and--

2393
02:14:10,044 --> 02:14:11,307
MATT: "Well."

2394
02:14:11,307 --> 02:14:16,145
LAURA: We were on very secret business for the
crown, actually. And that is why you weren't

2395
02:14:16,145 --> 02:14:17,884
informed of our business.

2396
02:14:17,884 --> 02:14:20,257
ORION: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?

2397
02:14:20,257 --> 02:14:22,505
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2398
02:14:22,505 --> 02:14:23,706
LAURA: Okay.

2399
02:14:23,706 --> 02:14:24,814
TRAVIS: Did you wink?

2400
02:14:24,814 --> 02:14:27,200
ORION: I'm responsible for casting the spell to
get us here to begin with.

2401
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:28,603
LAURA: (laughs) With advantage.

2402
02:14:28,603 --> 02:14:29,837
LIAM: Yes.

2403
02:14:29,837 --> 02:14:36,851
LAURA: That would be a 20-- no. 35.

2404
02:14:36,851 --> 02:14:43,532
MATT: All right. He looks to you, as you guys are
saying, he--

2405
02:14:43,532 --> 02:14:45,130
LAURA: That's not possible. 25.

2406
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:45,972
MATT: 25.

2407
02:14:45,972 --> 02:14:46,956
(laughter)

2408
02:14:46,956 --> 02:14:52,382
MATT: He stands up from the desk and gives you all
a look-over and says, "Well, I am Gatekeeper

2409
02:14:52,382 --> 02:15:00,580
"Xanthas, I am the evening keeper of the Traverse
Junction here in the-- it's the Traverse

2410
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:01,813
"Junction."

2411
02:15:01,813 --> 02:15:02,840
ORION: Gatekeeper?

2412
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:09,790
MATT: "Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late.
We are two hours past midnight."

2413
02:15:09,882 --> 02:15:16,625
TALIESIN: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von
Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we

2414
02:15:16,625 --> 02:15:22,076
would love to report to the emperor of your great
hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and

2415
02:15:22,076 --> 02:15:27,055
we would look forward to reporting of all of your
kindness and good housekeeping.

2416
02:15:27,055 --> 02:15:31,825
LIAM: I imagine he would be very upset if we were
delayed. We come with very grave news.

2417
02:15:31,825 --> 02:15:34,008
TALIESIN: I would hope not to imagine it.

2418
02:15:34,008 --> 02:15:37,534
MATT: "Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like
to know your business in the morning."

2419
02:15:37,534 --> 02:15:38,508
LAURA: Yes.

2420
02:15:38,508 --> 02:15:44,990
MATT: "Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster
Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would

2421
02:15:44,990 --> 02:15:49,862
"please submit a report for your reasons for using
the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure

2422
02:15:49,862 --> 02:15:51,624
"that would suffice for the required paperwork."

2423
02:15:51,624 --> 02:15:52,852
LAURA: Of course we will.

2424
02:15:52,852 --> 02:15:54,200
TALIESIN: You are too kind.

2425
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:59,485
LAURA: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep
that we have in town.

2426
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:00,984
ORION: Greyskull Keep.

2427
02:16:00,984 --> 02:16:05,302
MATT: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and
kinda goes, "Very well."

2428
02:16:05,479 --> 02:16:07,293
TALIESIN: Good day, good evening.

2429
02:16:07,293 --> 02:16:11,638
SAM: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You
know of our Keep, don't you?"

2430
02:16:11,638 --> 02:16:22,497
MATT: Okay. He goes, "I seem to recall hearing
about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I

2431
02:16:22,497 --> 02:16:26,549
"don't get out very often. Running the graveyard
shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my

2432
02:16:26,549 --> 02:16:27,881
"social life."

2433
02:16:27,881 --> 02:16:29,936
LAURA: You poor thing, you should get out more.

2434
02:16:29,936 --> 02:16:34,388
MATT: "Well here, let me show you out." And he
walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a

2435
02:16:34,444 --> 02:16:39,722
beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber
into a long series of white stone hallways,

2436
02:16:39,722 --> 02:16:44,216
similar material to what the first room you
arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer

2437
02:16:44,216 --> 02:16:49,524
area, which has a very high ceiling and a series
of beautifully carved pillars that show different

2438
02:16:49,524 --> 02:16:55,916
creatures, almost like devas and demons battling
each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the

2439
02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:59,062
front doorways. There are two guards that are
adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these

2440
02:16:59,062 --> 02:17:04,166
very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and
they step to the side as the doors

2441
02:17:04,166 --> 02:17:05,810
open on their own.

2442
02:17:05,810 --> 02:17:07,850
LAURA: Love the hat.

2443
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:12,299
MATT: Guards do not respond to you whatsoever,
they just step to the side. Gatekeeper says, "All

2444
02:17:12,299 --> 02:17:17,709
"right, well, here is your way out, have a
wonderful evening and do please return for your

2445
02:17:17,709 --> 02:17:19,199
"report on the morrow."

2446
02:17:19,199 --> 02:17:20,051
LAURA: Of course.

2447
02:17:20,051 --> 02:17:23,685
SAM: Oh, one more question before you leave, what
district are we in right now?

2448
02:17:23,685 --> 02:17:24,910
MATT: "The Erudite Quarter."

2449
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:25,960
SAM: Thank you.

2450
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,366
TRAVIS: Gesundheit.

2451
02:17:27,366 --> 02:17:33,922
MATT: "Good night." The doors slam (boof) behind
you as you guys exit, and you're now--

2452
02:17:33,922 --> 02:17:37,133
LAURA: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?

2453
02:17:37,133 --> 02:17:44,731
MARISHA: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on
her knees and starts kissing the ground.

2454
02:17:44,798 --> 02:17:46,542
TALIESIN: Well, that could've gone worse.

2455
02:17:46,542 --> 02:17:48,215
MARISHA: Oh, we're home.

2456
02:17:48,215 --> 02:17:50,770
ASHLEY: I just want to get in my bed so bad.

2457
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:53,982
MARISHA: Look! Stars!

2458
02:17:53,982 --> 02:18:00,662
MATT: You look up and, for the first time in close
to a week, you can see stars, you can see a

2459
02:18:00,662 --> 02:18:07,652
crescent moon, probably just past its single
quarter phase. It is a sight for

2460
02:18:07,887 --> 02:18:08,994
sore eyes right now.

2461
02:18:08,994 --> 02:18:10,209
ASHLEY: I'm so happy.

2462
02:18:10,209 --> 02:18:11,845
TRAVIS: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?

2463
02:18:11,845 --> 02:18:14,203
MATT: Currently? The most beautiful night sky
you've seen in all of your years.

2464
02:18:14,203 --> 02:18:15,625
TRAVIS: I ruin it with a fart.

2465
02:18:15,625 --> 02:18:18,397
(laughter)

2466
02:18:18,397 --> 02:18:21,335
ORION: I'm glad you held that the whole time we
were down there, Grog.

2467
02:18:21,335 --> 02:18:25,594
TRAVIS: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole
time, I'm sorry.

2468
02:18:25,594 --> 02:18:28,869
LAURA: What, are we just carrying around this
stone Kima with us, or are

2469
02:18:28,869 --> 02:18:30,325
we taking her back to our--

2470
02:18:30,325 --> 02:18:33,703
LIAM: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her
when you undo the stone.

2471
02:18:33,703 --> 02:18:36,523
ORION: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest
before we deal with this one.

2472
02:18:36,523 --> 02:18:37,381
TRAVIS: Yes.

2473
02:18:37,381 --> 02:18:41,012
ASHLEY: No, because I want to be able to have an
extra 5th-level spell.

2474
02:18:41,012 --> 02:18:42,016
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

2475
02:18:42,016 --> 02:18:43,624
LAURA: But we're in town now, so we're safe.

2476
02:18:43,624 --> 02:18:45,813
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.

2477
02:18:45,813 --> 02:18:47,764
LAURA: Yeah, so it'll be fine.

2478
02:18:47,764 --> 02:18:48,779
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2479
02:18:48,779 --> 02:18:52,007
SAM: It's a long way. We've got to go across the
whole town to get there.

2480
02:18:52,007 --> 02:18:54,672
LAURA: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.

2481
02:18:54,672 --> 02:18:56,746
SAM: We do have a flying carpet.

2482
02:18:56,746 --> 02:18:58,784
TALIESIN: The metro's running at this hour.

2483
02:18:58,784 --> 02:19:01,030
LIAM: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.

2484
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:02,154
LAURA: Yeah, we're in town!

2485
02:19:02,154 --> 02:19:03,107
LIAM: Yeah.

2486
02:19:03,107 --> 02:19:04,698
LAURA: Fuck it. Everything's possible.

2487
02:19:04,698 --> 02:19:06,846
TALIESIN: Let's go drinking.

2488
02:19:06,846 --> 02:19:08,951
MARISHA: I was going to say, what bars are open?

2489
02:19:08,951 --> 02:19:12,347
LIAM: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn.
The sky's the limit.

2490
02:19:12,347 --> 02:19:16,325
ASHLEY: I know, should we go to a tavern and get
some ale?

2491
02:19:16,325 --> 02:19:18,887
SAM: What, who are you?

2492
02:19:18,887 --> 02:19:21,390
TRAVIS: Really? You mean it?

2493
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:24,744
ASHLEY: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?

2494
02:19:24,744 --> 02:19:26,252
TRAVIS: It's all empty, can we fill it please?

2495
02:19:26,252 --> 02:19:27,657
ASHLEY: It's all empty?

2496
02:19:27,657 --> 02:19:33,245
MARISHA: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we
should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not

2497
02:19:33,245 --> 02:19:34,229
carrying it around.

2498
02:19:34,229 --> 02:19:35,562
TRAVIS: And the stone gnome.

2499
02:19:35,562 --> 02:19:37,134
MARISHA: And then go out drinking.

2500
02:19:37,134 --> 02:19:39,710
LIAM: We don't want to lose it in a game of
cards.

2501
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:41,577
MARISHA: Yes, exactly. Exactly.

2502
02:19:41,577 --> 02:19:43,803
TRAVIS: And stone Kima.

2503
02:19:43,803 --> 02:19:46,774
SAM: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before.
There's eight of us, we'll be fine,

2504
02:19:46,774 --> 02:19:48,059
let's go drinking.

2505
02:19:48,059 --> 02:19:49,733
ASHLEY: How far is the Keep from here?

2506
02:19:49,733 --> 02:19:52,248
MATT: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk.

2507
02:19:52,248 --> 02:19:53,732
MARISHA: Oh, we've got time.

2508
02:19:53,732 --> 02:19:56,831
TALIESIN: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have
a beer at every pub we hit on the way

2509
02:19:56,831 --> 02:19:57,932
back to the Keep.

2510
02:19:57,932 --> 02:20:00,205
MARISHA: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!

2511
02:20:00,205 --> 02:20:02,665
ALL: Pub crawl!

2512
02:20:02,665 --> 02:20:05,104
MARISHA: We're going to pub crawl back to the
Keep.

2513
02:20:05,127 --> 02:20:06,752
LIAM: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.

2514
02:20:06,752 --> 02:20:10,172
ASHLEY: But should I go just in a bush just behind
and--

2515
02:20:10,172 --> 02:20:11,836
SAM: Do you have to pee or something?

2516
02:20:11,836 --> 02:20:14,354
ASHLEY: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?

2517
02:20:14,354 --> 02:20:15,921
ALL: No!

2518
02:20:15,921 --> 02:20:17,352
SAM: We want to enjoy this.

2519
02:20:17,352 --> 02:20:19,273
ORION: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't
know.

2520
02:20:19,273 --> 02:20:20,482
SAM: Or humor.

2521
02:20:20,482 --> 02:20:22,412
TRAVIS: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of
stone!

2522
02:20:22,412 --> 02:20:24,182
LAURA: We won't tell her how much time has
passed.

2523
02:20:24,182 --> 02:20:27,081
TALIESIN: We'll un-stone her once we're back at
the Keep.

2524
02:20:27,081 --> 02:20:28,979
TRAVIS: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe.
Right?

2525
02:20:28,979 --> 02:20:30,272
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

2526
02:20:30,272 --> 02:20:31,674
SAM: We don't know.

2527
02:20:31,674 --> 02:20:36,939
LAURA: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do
not.

2528
02:20:36,939 --> 02:20:40,569
(laughter)

2529
02:20:40,569 --> 02:20:44,440
LIAM: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too.
But we could bring her around and introduce her;

2530
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,162
it could be like Weekend at Bernie's.

2531
02:20:46,162 --> 02:20:48,584
(laughter)

2532
02:20:48,584 --> 02:20:52,911
TRAVIS: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's
stone statue.

2533
02:20:52,911 --> 02:20:54,760
LAURA: This is so messed up.

2534
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:59,194
MATT: All right, so as you guys begin making your
celebratory pub crawl, starting with the Laughing

2535
02:20:59,194 --> 02:21:07,763
Lamia Tavern, you buy drinks, laugh, chatter, and
kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you

2536
02:21:07,763 --> 02:21:13,894
would find at 3AM. Which is a little, at this
point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk, but

2537
02:21:13,945 --> 02:21:17,658
at this point you don't care, you'll take your
own, and we'll take a quick five-minute break to

2538
02:21:17,658 --> 02:21:20,631
use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in
just a moment, we'll see you guys here in five

2539
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:22,601
minutes to continue.

2540
02:21:22,601 --> 02:21:23,668
TRAVIS: We lived!

2541
02:21:23,668 --> 02:21:24,700
MARISHA: We lived!

2542
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:25,739
MATT: Holy shit, guys.

2543
02:21:25,739 --> 02:21:27,494
ORION: I was fine.

2544
02:21:27,494 --> 02:22:36,462
[dramatic music]

2545
02:22:37,034 --> 02:22:44,719
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

2546
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:52,359
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

2547
02:22:52,359 --> 02:22:56,464
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

2548
02:22:56,464 --> 02:22:58,312
(record scratch) Wait.

2549
02:22:58,312 --> 02:23:04,891
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

2550
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:08,593
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

2551
02:23:08,641 --> 02:23:09,973
Also ale.

2552
02:23:09,973 --> 02:23:16,274
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

2553
02:23:16,274 --> 02:23:22,452
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

2554
02:23:22,452 --> 02:23:30,773
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

2555
02:23:30,773 --> 02:23:38,451
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience cost him

2556
02:23:38,451 --> 02:23:39,985
dearly.

2557
02:23:39,985 --> 02:23:47,572
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

2558
02:23:47,572 --> 02:23:54,658
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

2559
02:23:54,658 --> 02:24:02,656
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

2560
02:24:02,656 --> 02:24:08,158
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

2561
02:24:08,158 --> 02:24:15,352
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

2562
02:24:15,352 --> 02:24:21,490
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

2563
02:24:21,490 --> 02:24:22,806
Also ale!

2564
02:24:23,837 --> 02:24:28,128
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

2565
02:24:28,128 --> 02:24:33,076
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

2566
02:24:33,076 --> 02:24:35,080
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

2567
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:41,952
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

2568
02:24:41,952 --> 02:24:47,598
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

2569
02:24:47,598 --> 02:24:53,473
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

2570
02:24:53,473 --> 02:24:59,099
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

2571
02:24:59,099 --> 02:25:04,972
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

2572
02:25:04,972 --> 02:25:09,755
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

2573
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:14,812
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

2574
02:25:14,812 --> 02:25:22,257
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

2575
02:25:22,257 --> 02:25:27,920
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

2576
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:33,098
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

2577
02:25:33,098 --> 02:25:39,313
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

2578
02:25:39,313 --> 02:25:45,370
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

2579
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:51,010
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

2580
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:57,700
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

2581
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:03,707
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

2582
02:26:03,707 --> 02:26:05,514
will ever return.

2583
02:26:05,514 --> 02:26:11,032
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

2584
02:26:11,032 --> 02:26:17,417
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

2585
02:26:17,466 --> 02:26:25,914
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

2586
02:26:27,792 --> 02:26:33,076
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

2587
02:26:33,076 --> 02:26:38,890
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

2588
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:43,316
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

2589
02:26:43,316 --> 02:26:49,923
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

2590
02:26:49,923 --> 02:26:55,729
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

2591
02:26:55,729 --> 02:26:58,100
would stand in their way.

2592
02:26:58,100 --> 02:27:03,579
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

2593
02:27:03,579 --> 02:27:09,878
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

2594
02:27:09,878 --> 02:27:16,125
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

2595
02:27:16,125 --> 02:27:21,667
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

2596
02:27:21,667 --> 02:27:25,836
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

2597
02:27:25,836 --> 02:27:32,673
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

2598
02:27:32,673 --> 02:27:40,305
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

2599
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:47,298
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

2600
02:27:47,298 --> 02:27:53,018
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

2601
02:27:53,018 --> 02:27:59,169
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

2602
02:27:59,169 --> 02:28:04,194
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

2603
02:28:04,349 --> 02:28:10,690
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

2604
02:28:10,690 --> 02:28:15,999
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

2605
02:28:15,999 --> 02:28:19,025
life of service and devotion.

2606
02:28:19,025 --> 02:28:25,650
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

2607
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:31,583
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

2608
02:28:31,583 --> 02:28:35,180
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

2609
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:41,726
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

2610
02:28:41,726 --> 02:28:46,899
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

2611
02:28:46,899 --> 02:28:54,386
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

2612
02:28:54,386 --> 02:28:59,761
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could, bringing him

2613
02:28:59,761 --> 02:29:01,918
back to life.

2614
02:29:01,918 --> 02:29:09,687
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends,

2615
02:29:09,687 --> 02:29:16,372
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

2616
02:29:16,424 --> 02:29:23,306
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

2617
02:29:23,306 --> 02:29:28,360
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

2618
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:33,755
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

2619
02:29:33,755 --> 02:29:36,393
called the Broken Howl.

2620
02:29:36,393 --> 02:29:41,427
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her
morningstar in the other, this time,

2621
02:29:41,427 --> 02:29:43,598
Pike is ready.

2622
02:29:45,330 --> 02:29:50,764
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

2623
02:29:50,764 --> 02:29:52,250
eye on you.

2624
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:57,193
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

2625
02:29:57,193 --> 02:30:01,652
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

2626
02:30:01,652 --> 02:30:07,725
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

2627
02:30:07,775 --> 02:30:13,291
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr.

2628
02:30:13,291 --> 02:30:19,279
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world and honed his skills

2629
02:30:19,279 --> 02:30:22,116
as a bard extraordinaire.

2630
02:30:22,116 --> 02:30:26,549
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

2631
02:30:26,549 --> 02:30:32,323
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

2632
02:30:32,323 --> 02:30:38,615
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

2633
02:30:38,615 --> 02:30:42,726
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

2634
02:30:42,726 --> 02:30:50,051
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

2635
02:30:50,051 --> 02:30:55,381
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

2636
02:30:55,381 --> 02:30:57,151
gnome, Pike.

2637
02:30:57,151 --> 02:31:02,596
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

2638
02:31:02,596 --> 02:31:05,171
and makes the females swoon.

2639
02:31:06,902 --> 02:31:14,727
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

2640
02:31:14,727 --> 02:31:16,898
located in the heart of Draconia.

2641
02:31:16,898 --> 02:31:22,381
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

2642
02:31:22,381 --> 02:31:27,300
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

2643
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:32,128
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

2644
02:31:32,128 --> 02:31:37,746
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

2645
02:31:37,746 --> 02:31:42,146
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

2646
02:31:42,146 --> 02:31:46,806
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time.

2647
02:31:46,806 --> 02:31:51,092
MATT: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here
and apparently our Overlord has an announcement.

2648
02:31:51,092 --> 02:31:54,686
ZAC: You guys, we're only four away from another
giveaway, which is--

2649
02:31:54,686 --> 02:31:55,996
LUCAS: Two away!

2650
02:31:55,996 --> 02:32:00,639
ZAC: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this
is, we're going to get that before I even get back

2651
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:05,350
to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway.
It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the

2652
02:32:05,421 --> 02:32:08,255
starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be
signed by the cast.

2653
02:32:08,255 --> 02:32:09,188
MATT: Yep.

2654
02:32:09,188 --> 02:32:14,461
ZAC: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct,
next? Lucas?

2655
02:32:14,461 --> 02:32:16,045
LUCAS: Yeah. 3,400.

2656
02:32:16,045 --> 02:32:17,100
MATT: 3,400.

2657
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:21,062
ZAC: If we get to 3,400 by the end of the night,
we'll give away a whole other kit like this, with

2658
02:32:21,062 --> 02:32:25,866
the signed stuff, so you get to subscribe and it
supports the channel, keeps us running. I'm not

2659
02:32:25,866 --> 02:32:27,953
going to interrupt these guys, so when we hit the
number I'm just going to give it away through the

2660
02:32:28,001 --> 02:32:28,992
chat room.

2661
02:32:28,992 --> 02:32:33,338
MATT: Awesome, guys. Well done and congrats to
whoever ends up getting that, real fast I hope.

2662
02:32:33,338 --> 02:32:35,084
So, thank you Overlord.

2663
02:32:35,084 --> 02:32:39,165
TALIESIN: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw
this? Oh no.

2664
02:32:39,165 --> 02:32:40,678
MATT: Pass it off, it's fine.

2665
02:32:40,678 --> 02:32:42,589
TALIESIN: You get the horn.

2666
02:32:42,589 --> 02:32:43,909
LAURA: Can I hold it for a second?

2667
02:32:43,909 --> 02:32:44,932
TRAVIS: No.

2668
02:32:44,932 --> 02:32:47,203
ORION: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.

2669
02:32:47,203 --> 02:32:49,782
MARISHA: No.

2670
02:32:49,782 --> 02:32:51,493
ORION: I was like, don't touch it.

2671
02:32:51,493 --> 02:32:57,265
MATT: So. Eventually you all manage to make your
way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern

2672
02:32:57,265 --> 02:33:02,185
portion of the city. The guards let you through.
Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest

2673
02:33:02,185 --> 02:33:06,987
celebration that occurred about seven months
beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end

2674
02:33:06,987 --> 02:33:15,705
poorly. You make your way around the bend to the
large grass hill that is surrounded by the river

2675
02:33:15,705 --> 02:33:21,839
that skirts the outer southern portion of
Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against

2676
02:33:21,839 --> 02:33:30,894
the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home
there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way

2677
02:33:30,894 --> 02:33:37,376
to the front gates that surround the outskirts of
it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a

2678
02:33:37,376 --> 02:33:44,403
second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go,
"Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the

2679
02:33:44,403 --> 02:33:46,383
"throat you'll find."

2680
02:33:46,383 --> 02:33:48,436
MARISHA: Shayne, is that Shayne?

2681
02:33:48,436 --> 02:33:50,093
ORION: Is it dark right now?

2682
02:33:50,093 --> 02:33:51,103
MATT: It's dark, yes.

2683
02:33:51,103 --> 02:33:52,688
ORION: I cast Light. "It's us!"

2684
02:33:52,688 --> 02:33:56,595
MATT: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look
up and you can see, sitting on kind of the

2685
02:33:56,595 --> 02:33:57,852
watchtower perch--

2686
02:33:57,852 --> 02:33:59,328
MARISHA: Or wait, is that Jarett?

2687
02:33:59,328 --> 02:34:03,980
MATT: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair,
Shayne Tranter, one of the

2688
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:05,102
mercenaries you hired--

2689
02:34:05,102 --> 02:34:06,585
MARISHA: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first
time!

2690
02:34:06,585 --> 02:34:08,599
MATT: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and
she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at

2691
02:34:08,599 --> 02:34:09,755
the group, and she goes,

2692
02:34:09,755 --> 02:34:10,649
LIAM: Hello! Hi!

2693
02:34:10,649 --> 02:34:11,522
LAURA: Hope you remember us!

2694
02:34:11,522 --> 02:34:12,290
MARISHA: Shayne!

2695
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:13,130
TALIESIN: We're drunk!

2696
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:14,061
SAM: We pay you!

2697
02:34:14,061 --> 02:34:18,550
MATT: She laughs. Takes her crossbow, sets it to
her side.

2698
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:20,056
ASHLEY: We forgot our key!

2699
02:34:20,056 --> 02:34:22,991
MATT: "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes?
It's been nearly a week since you left."

2700
02:34:22,991 --> 02:34:24,325
LAURA: That's it?

2701
02:34:24,325 --> 02:34:25,476
SAM: Feels like a month.

2702
02:34:25,476 --> 02:34:27,795
ASHLEY: Feels like three months.

2703
02:34:27,795 --> 02:34:31,402
TALIESIN: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a
very long time.

2704
02:34:31,402 --> 02:34:38,554
MATT: "Well, it's probably closer to two weeks.
Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell,

2705
02:34:38,554 --> 02:34:39,939
"open the gates!"

2706
02:34:39,939 --> 02:34:42,689
SAM: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of
our guards.

2707
02:34:42,689 --> 02:34:45,749
MATT: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc
guards that you hired when you left.

2708
02:34:45,749 --> 02:34:50,157
MARISHA: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett,
Kendrick, and Nitebe.

2709
02:34:50,157 --> 02:34:53,799
LAURA: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head
guard, right? Captain?

2710
02:34:53,799 --> 02:34:59,747
MARISHA: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that
part down.

2711
02:34:59,747 --> 02:35:01,551
LAURA: I don't remember about the little fellow.

2712
02:35:01,551 --> 02:35:04,969
SAM: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.

2713
02:35:04,969 --> 02:35:12,987
MATT: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking
out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in

2714
02:35:13,111 --> 02:35:18,632
scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his
back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot

2715
02:35:18,632 --> 02:35:25,287
distance. "Come on. Welcome home." As each of you
guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back

2716
02:35:25,287 --> 02:35:32,980
as you walk in. You make your way into the small
courtyard leading to-- making your way into

2717
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:36,193
Greyskull Keep.

2718
02:35:36,193 --> 02:35:41,082
Towards the front door, as you get there, the
front door opens on its own as you're about ten

2719
02:35:41,082 --> 02:35:44,892
feet away and peering from the inside of the
low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump

2720
02:35:44,892 --> 02:35:53,205
blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina.
Laina goes, "Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's

2721
02:35:53,205 --> 02:35:56,181
"early." And she rubs her face and you see as she
pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing

2722
02:35:56,181 --> 02:36:01,679
her nightgown, and she's excited but still very
tired. "Come in, come in, come in, please, please!

2723
02:36:01,679 --> 02:36:06,685
"Who's that?" And points to the large stone statue
you're dragging behind you.

2724
02:36:06,755 --> 02:36:09,646
LAURA: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the
garden.

2725
02:36:09,646 --> 02:36:11,719
TALIESIN: Garden gnome.

2726
02:36:11,719 --> 02:36:13,764
MATT: "Very well, very well, come in."

2727
02:36:13,764 --> 02:36:14,988
ASHLEY: Hey!

2728
02:36:14,988 --> 02:36:16,987
(laughter)

2729
02:36:16,987 --> 02:36:19,443
TRAVIS: He's drunk.

2730
02:36:19,443 --> 02:36:21,207
TALIESIN: I'm drunk!

2731
02:36:21,207 --> 02:36:25,147
MATT: So the human woman leads you all back in.

2732
02:36:25,147 --> 02:36:27,865
LAURA: Put the gun down, Percy.

2733
02:36:27,865 --> 02:36:29,141
ASHLEY: Bad News.

2734
02:36:29,141 --> 02:36:32,403
LIAM: It's not Cinco de Mayo.

2735
02:36:32,403 --> 02:36:41,205
MATT: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's
definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs

2736
02:36:41,205 --> 02:36:47,045
each of you as you enter, happy that you've all
arrived, she's like, "I swear it's-- I've not had

2737
02:36:47,045 --> 02:36:53,316
"an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But
glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone

2738
02:36:53,316 --> 02:36:55,251
"a meal, are you hungry?"

2739
02:36:55,251 --> 02:36:56,088
MARISHA: Starving.

2740
02:36:56,088 --> 02:36:57,240
TRAVIS: Yes.

2741
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:01,684
MATT: "I'll get right to it." And she turns
around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen

2742
02:37:01,684 --> 02:37:07,090
Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles
up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling

2743
02:37:07,269 --> 02:37:12,699
off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe
on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. "My

2744
02:37:12,699 --> 02:37:19,508
"goodness. The hour is late of your arrival, but I
can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in,

2745
02:37:19,508 --> 02:37:26,899
"your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and
made to your specifications. Laina! To food!"

2746
02:37:26,899 --> 02:37:29,373
"I'm already on it, Erwen." She kinda smacks him
on the back.

2747
02:37:29,373 --> 02:37:32,218
He says, "Very well, then."

2748
02:37:32,218 --> 02:37:33,546
SAM: I love their banter.

2749
02:37:33,546 --> 02:37:35,314
LAURA: Yeah, they're so cute.

2750
02:37:35,314 --> 02:37:38,626
MATT: "I will go back to bed, if that's fine with
you."

2751
02:37:38,626 --> 02:37:42,455
SAM: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any
visitors that we should know about who came while

2752
02:37:42,455 --> 02:37:46,269
we were gone, anything before you retire for the
evening?

2753
02:37:46,269 --> 02:37:52,571
MATT: "No, I believe your friend, the mage woman
with the blue robes came by once."

2754
02:37:52,571 --> 02:37:53,877
SAM: Allara?

2755
02:37:53,877 --> 02:37:59,818
MATT: "Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just
to see if you had returned. But I didn't know

2756
02:37:59,818 --> 02:38:02,145
"where you were, and she said she'd try again
later."

2757
02:38:02,145 --> 02:38:04,134
SAM: Any packages, mail, post?

2758
02:38:04,134 --> 02:38:08,453
MATT: "None that I know of, no. In fact it's been
very quiet."

2759
02:38:08,503 --> 02:38:11,279
SAM: All right, thank you.

2760
02:38:11,279 --> 02:38:12,297
LAURA: All right.

2761
02:38:12,297 --> 02:38:13,293
TALIESIN: Quiet is good.

2762
02:38:13,293 --> 02:38:15,629
MATT: "Back to my quarters." And he shuffles off,
goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into

2763
02:38:15,629 --> 02:38:20,946
the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large
round tables set out with the chairs around it.

2764
02:38:20,946 --> 02:38:26,915
You can see, for the most part, it's been
untouched other than a couple of chairs that are

2765
02:38:26,915 --> 02:38:33,112
set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers
who've been eating and/or have been keeping up.

2766
02:38:33,112 --> 02:38:36,882
There's a couple of empty tables set on the side
that immediately Laina goes, "I'm so sorry, I

2767
02:38:36,882 --> 02:38:42,423
"guess I should've taken care of this." And she
stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all

2768
02:38:42,423 --> 02:38:48,545
eventually find yourselves sitting, sore,
exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs

2769
02:38:48,545 --> 02:38:56,620
and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at
being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep.

2770
02:38:56,620 --> 02:39:00,958
SAM: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep
on it?

2771
02:39:00,958 --> 02:39:06,319
ORION: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping
quarters and I just say, "Leave her to stone

2772
02:39:06,372 --> 02:39:08,588
"tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow." And I go to
bed.

2773
02:39:08,588 --> 02:39:10,237
SAM: I turn him into a rat.

2774
02:39:10,237 --> 02:39:12,652
LIAM: Dispel Magic.

2775
02:39:12,652 --> 02:39:17,421
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw,
Tiberius.

2776
02:39:17,421 --> 02:39:20,910
ORION: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an
animal, right?

2777
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:21,882
SAM: Nope.

2778
02:39:21,882 --> 02:39:23,295
MATT: Nope, you cannot talk.

2779
02:39:23,295 --> 02:39:24,487
ORION: Oh. I still go to bed.

2780
02:39:24,487 --> 02:39:29,422
(laughter)

2781
02:39:29,422 --> 02:39:31,170
ORION: So yeah.

2782
02:39:31,170 --> 02:39:32,507
TRAVIS: Hoo baby.

2783
02:39:32,507 --> 02:39:33,665
LAURA: That's adorable.

2784
02:39:33,665 --> 02:39:37,657
MATT: You go under your covers, go to sleep,
nuzzle in.

2785
02:39:37,657 --> 02:39:40,947
ORION: In between my pillow.

2786
02:39:40,947 --> 02:39:44,288
MARISHA: It's quite comfy sleeping like an
animal.

2787
02:39:44,288 --> 02:39:47,873
ASHLEY: He's a little rat and he still went in his
big bed.

2788
02:39:47,873 --> 02:39:50,606
LIAM: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda
scritch him.

2789
02:39:50,606 --> 02:39:52,347
LAURA: He's in bed.

2790
02:39:52,347 --> 02:39:56,512
LIAM: It's all right, he's fine. Look, see, his
leg's going, he's dreaming about something nice.

2791
02:39:56,512 --> 02:39:58,365
TRAVIS: We ate already, right?

2792
02:39:58,365 --> 02:40:02,808
MATT: You snacked a bit as you made it through the
town, but for the most part like, a meal's being

2793
02:40:02,858 --> 02:40:07,026
prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of
meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys.

2794
02:40:07,078 --> 02:40:09,359
LIAM: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't
you?

2795
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:15,765
LAURA: Quick question, friends: So we kind of
started a war, am I right?

2796
02:40:15,765 --> 02:40:17,973
LIAM: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.

2797
02:40:17,973 --> 02:40:21,353
LAURA: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger,
am I right?

2798
02:40:21,353 --> 02:40:23,207
MARISHA: We might want to let them know.

2799
02:40:23,207 --> 02:40:25,339
LAURA: We should probably let them know as soon as
possible.

2800
02:40:25,339 --> 02:40:29,997
LIAM: First of all, Clarota was lying through his
noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he

2801
02:40:29,997 --> 02:40:32,359
was, he's now fucking pissed off--

2802
02:40:32,359 --> 02:40:33,646
LAURA: He's dead.

2803
02:40:33,646 --> 02:40:38,836
LIAM: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right?
Listen. This is number five tonight.

2804
02:40:38,836 --> 02:40:41,451
TALIESIN: They weren't particularly connected
until the very end, he was dead before they were

2805
02:40:41,451 --> 02:40:42,599
actually connected.

2806
02:40:42,599 --> 02:40:44,825
LIAM: They're angry. They were following us.

2807
02:40:44,825 --> 02:40:46,390
TALIESIN: They may not know who we are.

2808
02:40:46,390 --> 02:40:48,108
MARISHA: That's interesting.

2809
02:40:48,108 --> 02:40:51,880
LIAM: You don't think they're going to scurry up
the bottom of Kraghammer and tear

2810
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:53,266
that place apart?

2811
02:40:53,266 --> 02:40:56,987
TALIESIN: We'll let them know, but we may have
time, we hurt them very badly.

2812
02:40:56,987 --> 02:41:02,472
LIAM: It took us about a week to get from
Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.

2813
02:41:02,472 --> 02:41:06,010
MARISHA: Well, why don't we do some research, I
mean, this was the first time.

2814
02:41:06,010 --> 02:41:09,829
SAM: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out
the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.

2815
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,629
ASHLEY: Don't the dwarves already know that they
were there, and they were

2816
02:41:12,629 --> 02:41:14,406
already prepping for battle?

2817
02:41:14,406 --> 02:41:16,152
SAM: They don't really know what's coming for
them.

2818
02:41:16,152 --> 02:41:19,885
LIAM: They don't know anything about mind flayers,
they know about weird things coming out, but not

2819
02:41:19,934 --> 02:41:20,903
the mind flayers.

2820
02:41:20,903 --> 02:41:22,560
TRAVIS: So let's send a pigeon or something.

2821
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:24,852
TALIESIN: The mind flayers have been down there
for ages. There's nothing new.

2822
02:41:24,852 --> 02:41:27,452
LAURA: You don't think they'll come up and
attack?

2823
02:41:27,452 --> 02:41:34,400
MARISHA: To be fair, we also did sort of release
the mind flayers from their evil dictator.

2824
02:41:34,462 --> 02:41:37,166
LIAM: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.

2825
02:41:37,166 --> 02:41:40,386
SAM: We could stop them on their way out.

2826
02:41:40,386 --> 02:41:43,054
TALIESIN: I think this will also be a conversation
that Lady Kima will have some--

2827
02:41:43,054 --> 02:41:48,714
MARISHA: Okay, well, the thing we then need to
immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima,

2828
02:41:48,714 --> 02:41:50,485
is what're we going to do with the Horn?

2829
02:41:50,485 --> 02:41:54,977
TALIESIN: I think if we have Allura here, and
begin that conversation, then we

2830
02:41:54,977 --> 02:41:57,448
can have Allura's insight.

2831
02:41:57,448 --> 02:41:59,372
MARISHA: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?

2832
02:41:59,372 --> 02:42:03,090
TALIESIN: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we
un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--

2833
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:06,401
LIAM: The only person, the only person that would
remotely know is you, Tiberius,

2834
02:42:06,401 --> 02:42:07,718
and I don't think--

2835
02:42:07,718 --> 02:42:08,600
SAM: He's a rat.

2836
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:10,111
LIAM: Oh, that's a good boy.

2837
02:42:10,111 --> 02:42:11,170
TRAVIS: And he's asleep.

2838
02:42:11,170 --> 02:42:15,528
LIAM: He didn't seem to know anything, I think
Allura is the person to go to right now.

2839
02:42:15,528 --> 02:42:17,205
LAURA: Well, you need to share it with us.

2840
02:42:17,205 --> 02:42:18,528
ASHLEY: Wake up from bed!

2841
02:42:18,528 --> 02:42:19,949
TRAVIS: He's sleeping.

2842
02:42:19,949 --> 02:42:22,610
TALIESIN: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I
think, and we can--

2843
02:42:22,610 --> 02:42:26,720
TRAVIS: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the
Horn? Or do we not?

2844
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:27,822
LIAM: Yes, yes, we do.

2845
02:42:27,822 --> 02:42:29,611
MARISHA: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?

2846
02:42:29,611 --> 02:42:32,772
LAURA: Tiberius. Little darling!

2847
02:42:32,772 --> 02:42:34,151
SAM: I'm still punishing him.

2848
02:42:34,151 --> 02:42:35,703
LIAM: I'm still cuddling him.

2849
02:42:35,703 --> 02:42:37,327
ORION: Did they wake me up?

2850
02:42:37,327 --> 02:42:39,406
LIAM: No! I'm holding you.

2851
02:42:39,406 --> 02:42:40,279
ORION: Okay.

2852
02:42:40,279 --> 02:42:41,111
LIAM: I don't want to wake you up.

2853
02:42:41,111 --> 02:42:43,038
MATT: You start to wake up, and then he scritches
the side of your cheek and

2854
02:42:43,038 --> 02:42:46,162
you go right back to sleep.

2855
02:42:46,162 --> 02:42:50,214
LAURA: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to
do.

2856
02:42:50,214 --> 02:42:52,704
MATT: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and
sets up these--

2857
02:42:52,704 --> 02:42:54,124
TRAVIS: Thank. God.

2858
02:42:54,124 --> 02:43:00,999
MATT: They're not pretty, but functional meals of
cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes.

2859
02:43:00,999 --> 02:43:03,509
TRAVIS: I would like to eat.

2860
02:43:03,509 --> 02:43:11,199
MATT: And you do ravenously, and this is the first
warm meal you've really truly

2861
02:43:11,199 --> 02:43:14,440
had in five, six days.

2862
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:17,487
TRAVIS: I take Lady Kima's portions and I--

2863
02:43:17,487 --> 02:43:21,398
MATT: There were no portions made for your garden
structure.

2864
02:43:21,398 --> 02:43:23,413
TRAVIS: Never know.

2865
02:43:23,413 --> 02:43:24,806
MATT: That's okay, there's plenty more.

2866
02:43:24,806 --> 02:43:28,820
SAM: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady
Kima?

2867
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:31,610
LIAM: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that
she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she

2868
02:43:31,610 --> 02:43:33,035
comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--

2869
02:43:33,035 --> 02:43:36,691
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she
did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on

2870
02:43:36,691 --> 02:43:39,260
the side that we don't--

2871
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:40,939
TRAVIS: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.

2872
02:43:40,939 --> 02:43:42,503
TALIESIN: We're going to have to trust somebody.

2873
02:43:42,503 --> 02:43:51,019
TRAVIS: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a
second and see what they do without it.

2874
02:43:51,019 --> 02:43:55,744
LAURA: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it?
Why don't we just hide the Horn?

2875
02:43:55,744 --> 02:43:57,568
TRAVIS: We just hold onto it in the bag.

2876
02:43:57,568 --> 02:44:00,567
MARISHA: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a
safe in our Keep?

2877
02:44:00,617 --> 02:44:05,543
MATT: You did not have a safe built, but you could
possibly have that done.

2878
02:44:05,543 --> 02:44:11,172
ASHLEY: Wait, so why are you guys so against
giving the Horn to Kima?

2879
02:44:11,172 --> 02:44:16,520
MARISHA: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why
does she want it for herself?

2880
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:18,579
LAURA: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.

2881
02:44:18,579 --> 02:44:20,061
ASHLEY: Does she want to destroy it?

2882
02:44:20,061 --> 02:44:23,096
LAURA: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she
wanted to get it up above ground so she could

2883
02:44:23,096 --> 02:44:23,970
destroy it.

2884
02:44:23,970 --> 02:44:27,113
SAM: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the
other one and wants the matching set.

2885
02:44:27,113 --> 02:44:28,511
TALIESIN: Do we know that there's a second horn?

2886
02:44:28,511 --> 02:44:31,847
LAURA: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are
good by--

2887
02:44:31,847 --> 02:44:34,060
SAM: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting
Clarota.

2888
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:36,269
TRAVIS: Do you want to wake up, do you have
something important to say?

2889
02:44:36,269 --> 02:44:38,996
MARISHA: Right, because no one of the church has
ever been bad before.

2890
02:44:38,996 --> 02:44:43,482
LIAM: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him
as much as he was using us.

2891
02:44:43,482 --> 02:44:45,073
LAURA: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.

2892
02:44:45,073 --> 02:44:46,791
LIAM: It went south. Well, most of us.

2893
02:44:46,791 --> 02:44:51,960
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take
the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake.

2894
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:53,396
SAM: He's still a rat!

2895
02:44:53,396 --> 02:44:55,540
TRAVIS: I shake it a lot.

2896
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:59,733
MARISHA: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his
Polymorph.

2897
02:44:59,733 --> 02:45:00,688
SAM and MATT: With what?

2898
02:45:00,688 --> 02:45:02,247
MARISHA: By Polymorph.

2899
02:45:02,247 --> 02:45:04,297
MATT: You re-Polymorph him?

2900
02:45:04,297 --> 02:45:06,665
MARISHA: Can I release Polymorph by using
Polymorph?

2901
02:45:06,727 --> 02:45:08,993
MATT: No. It's his incantation.

2902
02:45:08,993 --> 02:45:12,931
TRAVIS: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in
vigorously.

2903
02:45:13,003 --> 02:45:16,646
MARISHA: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to
him.

2904
02:45:16,646 --> 02:45:22,179
ORION: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.

2905
02:45:22,179 --> 02:45:25,491
MATT: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with
chunks of pork and mashed potato

2906
02:45:25,491 --> 02:45:26,519
rubbed in your fur.

2907
02:45:26,519 --> 02:45:30,924
MARISHA: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius
is nipping. Please.

2908
02:45:30,924 --> 02:45:32,997
SAM: All right, fine. He's a human thing again.

2909
02:45:32,997 --> 02:45:34,554
LIAM: He's not human at all.

2910
02:45:34,554 --> 02:45:35,840
SAM: A dragonborn.

2911
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:39,243
ORION: Why did you wake me up? I was so comfy
being furry!

2912
02:45:39,243 --> 02:45:40,523
(laughter)

2913
02:45:40,523 --> 02:45:42,344
ORION: I always have scales. It was nice having
fur!

2914
02:45:42,344 --> 02:45:45,217
MARISHA: I told you. It's nice being cuddly.

2915
02:45:45,217 --> 02:45:47,185
ORION: I was so soft.

2916
02:45:47,185 --> 02:45:48,883
LAURA: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.

2917
02:45:48,883 --> 02:45:51,522
TALIESIN: Tiberius, we're having a lovely
breakfast. Tell us a story.

2918
02:45:51,522 --> 02:45:55,092
ORION: Have I rested? What's going on?

2919
02:45:55,092 --> 02:45:56,735
MATT: No, it's been ten minutes.

2920
02:45:56,735 --> 02:45:57,787
ORION: What the fuck?

2921
02:45:57,787 --> 02:45:58,768
(laughter)

2922
02:45:58,768 --> 02:45:59,834
TRAVIS: Vex has a question for you.

2923
02:45:59,834 --> 02:46:04,988
MARISHA: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't
want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.

2924
02:46:05,042 --> 02:46:14,318
LAURA: I just want to hear your lovely little
explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and

2925
02:46:14,371 --> 02:46:15,939
why you don't trust Kima.

2926
02:46:15,939 --> 02:46:16,788
ORION: Oh!

2927
02:46:16,788 --> 02:46:18,444
TALIESIN: Tell us a story.

2928
02:46:18,444 --> 02:46:19,755
MARISHA: Tell us a story!

2929
02:46:19,755 --> 02:46:22,104
LAURA: Please. You haven't told any of us
anything.

2930
02:46:22,104 --> 02:46:24,989
MARISHA: We haven't talked to you in a week.

2931
02:46:24,989 --> 02:46:26,780
ORION: The Horn of Orcus.

2932
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:28,449
MATT: Horn of Orcus.

2933
02:46:28,449 --> 02:46:36,775
ORION: This thing comes from a devil, a demon.
Nothing good could ever come from anything it made

2934
02:46:36,775 --> 02:46:41,375
in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm
sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit

2935
02:46:41,375 --> 02:46:49,405
more. There is nothing that you can use this
particular artifact for any reason of good. The

2936
02:46:49,405 --> 02:46:56,018
fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because
it was taken from one of these beasts.

2937
02:46:56,068 --> 02:46:57,559
ASHLEY: So why don't we destroy it?

2938
02:46:57,559 --> 02:46:59,709
ORION: That's exactly what we need to do.

2939
02:46:59,709 --> 02:47:01,355
TRAVIS: Isn't that what Kima wanted?

2940
02:47:01,355 --> 02:47:02,819
LAURA: What if they want to destroy it?

2941
02:47:02,819 --> 02:47:04,483
ORION: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.

2942
02:47:04,483 --> 02:47:06,056
LAURA: Question. Why?

2943
02:47:06,056 --> 02:47:12,075
ORION: Because there is-- the liquid hot magma
that was below where it was being held was very

2944
02:47:12,079 --> 02:47:14,924
sufficient for it to be thrown in.

2945
02:47:14,924 --> 02:47:19,235
MARISHA: That's true. See, I'm with him.

2946
02:47:19,235 --> 02:47:25,440
LAURA: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't
destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so

2947
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:28,247
maybe it needs something extra special that only
they know about.

2948
02:47:28,247 --> 02:47:29,895
TRAVIS: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.

2949
02:47:29,895 --> 02:47:31,820
ORION: No. Pike could destroy it.

2950
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:36,756
ASHLEY: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.

2951
02:47:36,756 --> 02:47:42,392
ORION: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You
killed a dragon.

2952
02:47:42,392 --> 02:47:45,295
LAURA and TRAVIS: You did kill a dragon.

2953
02:47:45,295 --> 02:47:47,178
ASHLEY: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.

2954
02:47:47,178 --> 02:47:51,441
MARISHA: And you died. And come back to life. By
the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it

2955
02:47:51,441 --> 02:47:52,556
like on the other side?

2956
02:47:52,556 --> 02:47:53,903
TRAVIS: Let's stay on topic here.

2957
02:47:53,903 --> 02:47:55,659
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.

2958
02:47:55,659 --> 02:48:00,488
LIAM: Vax shoves another flagon in front of
Keyleth.

2959
02:48:00,488 --> 02:48:02,077
ASHLEY: I don't think I can destroy it.

2960
02:48:02,077 --> 02:48:06,367
TALIESIN: From what I understand-- is it possible
that it's not possible to destroy this and instead

2961
02:48:06,422 --> 02:48:08,930
it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?

2962
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:15,293
ORION: No. If it could be a permanent banishment,
yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what

2963
02:48:15,350 --> 02:48:21,898
creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon
that artifact. What are the elements?

2964
02:48:21,898 --> 02:48:24,394
Fire burns earth.

2965
02:48:24,394 --> 02:48:26,948
LAURA: Wind blows.

2966
02:48:26,948 --> 02:48:31,053
ORION: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the
only one who--

2967
02:48:31,053 --> 02:48:32,687
SAM: Rock beats scissors.

2968
02:48:32,687 --> 02:48:36,826
ORION: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who
could-- if your weapon had any kind of light

2969
02:48:36,826 --> 02:48:41,968
enchantment on them, could probably smash this
thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the

2970
02:48:41,968 --> 02:48:47,818
remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not
find different ways to destroy those pieces.

2971
02:48:47,818 --> 02:48:49,934
LAURA: Why don't you trust them?

2972
02:48:49,934 --> 02:48:52,637
ORION: Because it comes from something that
would--

2973
02:48:52,637 --> 02:48:55,267
LAURA: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?

2974
02:48:55,267 --> 02:49:00,264
ORION: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere
where they-- I don't know. Which is why I wanted

2975
02:49:00,264 --> 02:49:05,264
you to do the half thing, where we could question
Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt

2976
02:49:05,264 --> 02:49:06,552
to take the Horn from us.

2977
02:49:06,552 --> 02:49:10,522
MARISHA: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has
good intentions. Say she has good intentions and

2978
02:49:10,596 --> 02:49:15,537
maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to
study it. And no one should be messing with this

2979
02:49:15,537 --> 02:49:16,891
whatsoever.

2980
02:49:16,891 --> 02:49:18,488
LAURA: I think they want to destroy it.

2981
02:49:18,488 --> 02:49:20,422
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion they probably want to
banish it somewhere.

2982
02:49:20,422 --> 02:49:21,498
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think they do.

2983
02:49:21,498 --> 02:49:26,821
MARISHA: Then why don't we just agree to not hand
it over.

2984
02:49:26,821 --> 02:49:30,840
TALIESIN: No, this is good. This means that
there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them.

2985
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:35,040
We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and
that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.

2986
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:38,609
LIAM: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to
send it to another dimension for a while?

2987
02:49:38,609 --> 02:49:41,054
LAURA: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our
sight.

2988
02:49:41,054 --> 02:49:42,837
SAM: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.

2989
02:49:42,837 --> 02:49:43,954
TRAVIS: Put it in the bag.

2990
02:49:43,954 --> 02:49:45,050
LAURA: It's in the bag.

2991
02:49:45,050 --> 02:49:46,216
TALIESIN: It's perfectly safe in the bag.

2992
02:49:46,216 --> 02:49:50,187
TRAVIS: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the
bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you

2993
02:49:50,187 --> 02:49:54,911
back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did,
what would you do with it?" And then we decide

2994
02:49:54,911 --> 02:49:56,002
what we do.

2995
02:49:56,002 --> 02:49:57,556
TALIESIN: I like half that plan.

2996
02:49:57,556 --> 02:49:58,628
MARISHA: I kind of like that plan.

2997
02:49:58,628 --> 02:49:59,776
ORION: I like that plan, too.

2998
02:49:59,776 --> 02:50:01,867
LAURA: I think we should tell her we didn't get it
and see what she does.

2999
02:50:01,867 --> 02:50:07,840
ORION: Allura is somebody who should not be here
when this conversation happens, because if they

3000
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:10,215
turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than
I.

3001
02:50:10,215 --> 02:50:17,227
MARISHA: We need to decide, do we tell her that we
destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just

3002
02:50:17,227 --> 02:50:19,327
didn't get it and that it's still down there.

3003
02:50:19,327 --> 02:50:21,231
TRAVIS: We can't say destroyed because we don't
know how we did that, right?

3004
02:50:21,231 --> 02:50:29,683
LAURA: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no,
they, we got overrun and we had to leave."

3005
02:50:29,683 --> 02:50:32,424
TALIESIN: But then they're going to tell us to go
back for it.

3006
02:50:32,424 --> 02:50:36,845
TRAVIS: That's fine, but if we ask like what she
would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we

3007
02:50:36,845 --> 02:50:38,249
go, "Hah, we have it."

3008
02:50:38,249 --> 02:50:42,546
LAURA: Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we
do have it, you can do that."

3009
02:50:42,546 --> 02:50:45,927
TRAVIS: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it
or transform it into something, we don't give it

3010
02:50:45,927 --> 02:50:49,616
to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she
wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius

3011
02:50:49,616 --> 02:50:52,262
is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have
it."

3012
02:50:52,262 --> 02:50:58,051
LIAM: When we meet her I don't think we should
have it, I think one or two of us should take it

3013
02:50:58,051 --> 02:51:00,947
away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.

3014
02:51:00,947 --> 02:51:03,392
TALIESIN: I think we just keep it in the Bag of
Holding, she'll never suspect.

3015
02:51:03,445 --> 02:51:05,438
MARISHA: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding
right now?

3016
02:51:05,438 --> 02:51:06,226
LAURA: Yeah.

3017
02:51:06,226 --> 02:51:07,445
TALIESIN: Yes.

3018
02:51:07,445 --> 02:51:08,741
ORION: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of
holding?

3019
02:51:08,741 --> 02:51:11,935
TRAVIS: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff
it can turn into some like evil transformer or

3020
02:51:11,998 --> 02:51:13,137
something.

3021
02:51:13,137 --> 02:51:16,744
LIAM: You know, the other characters can make
insight checks too, you know that, right?

3022
02:51:16,744 --> 02:51:18,462
MATT: There's a pile somewhere with armor.

3023
02:51:18,462 --> 02:51:20,247
TRAVIS: Everything has out with parentheses next
to it.

3024
02:51:20,247 --> 02:51:24,502
LIAM: If we have it, then she's, she could say
you're lying--

3025
02:51:24,502 --> 02:51:29,885
LAURA: Or she might not be able to tell because
we're so good at lying.

3026
02:51:29,885 --> 02:51:31,559
(laughter)

3027
02:51:31,559 --> 02:51:33,303
LIAM: I don't think your winks will work on her.

3028
02:51:33,303 --> 02:51:34,918
SAM: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm
lying.

3029
02:51:34,918 --> 02:51:39,849
MARISHA: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I
could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in

3030
02:51:40,012 --> 02:51:40,814
our Keep.

3031
02:51:40,814 --> 02:51:42,140
TRAVIS: One person should leave with it. I'll
leave with it.

3032
02:51:42,140 --> 02:51:43,636
LIAM: Yes, it's fucking simple.

3033
02:51:43,636 --> 02:51:44,627
TALIESIN: That's genius.

3034
02:51:44,627 --> 02:51:47,745
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going
to talk to the sorcerers.

3035
02:51:47,745 --> 02:51:51,318
LIAM: You and I could take a walk with it and play
tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's

3036
02:51:51,318 --> 02:51:52,577
fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.

3037
02:51:52,577 --> 02:51:54,415
TALIESIN: That's a very good plan.

3038
02:51:54,415 --> 02:51:55,751
ORION: Do you want it very far away?

3039
02:51:55,751 --> 02:51:56,883
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.

3040
02:51:56,883 --> 02:51:58,065
TALIESIN: No, we don't.

3041
02:51:58,065 --> 02:52:02,091
MARISHA: Wait. You're talking about just taking a
stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?

3042
02:52:02,091 --> 02:52:03,594
TRAVIS: No, I'll just hang out outside.

3043
02:52:03,594 --> 02:52:05,743
ORION: In the Keep, how about just stay in the
Keep?

3044
02:52:05,819 --> 02:52:07,585
LIAM: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.

3045
02:52:07,585 --> 02:52:09,949
ASHLEY: You could hang out in the temple
downstairs.

3046
02:52:09,949 --> 02:52:11,320
LAURA: I fall asleep on the table.

3047
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:13,123
TRAVIS: Shall we sleep?

3048
02:52:13,123 --> 02:52:15,861
SAM: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the
morning.

3049
02:52:15,861 --> 02:52:18,418
TALIESIN: This was a fabulous breakfast, good
night.

3050
02:52:18,418 --> 02:52:20,147
LIAM: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.

3051
02:52:20,147 --> 02:52:21,532
LAURA: Ugh!

3052
02:52:21,532 --> 02:52:24,103
TRAVIS: I put my head right in my food and fall
asleep.

3053
02:52:24,103 --> 02:52:25,004
MATT: Okay.

3054
02:52:25,004 --> 02:52:26,631
TALIESIN: Let's not forget, you've still got a
funny toe.

3055
02:52:26,631 --> 02:52:28,607
SAM: I check my bed to make sure no one shat in
it.

3056
02:52:28,607 --> 02:52:30,597
(laughter)

3057
02:52:30,597 --> 02:52:34,139
ORION: I did leave a little rat turd before I got
scooped out. Just so you know.

3058
02:52:34,139 --> 02:52:36,181
LAURA: Trinket, let's go to bed.

3059
02:52:36,181 --> 02:52:39,842
MARISHA: I turn, I go Minxie and I curl up by the
fire.

3060
02:52:39,842 --> 02:52:41,154
TRAVIS: Yeah, Minxie!

3061
02:52:41,154 --> 02:52:45,468
LIAM: Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.

3062
02:52:45,468 --> 02:52:47,204
ORION: Oh yes, I'm going to bed.

3063
02:52:47,204 --> 02:52:48,414
LIAM: Back into a rat.

3064
02:52:48,414 --> 02:52:49,789
MARISHA: You can curl up with me.

3065
02:52:49,789 --> 02:52:51,458
SAM: Would you like to be a rat?

3066
02:52:51,458 --> 02:52:53,462
ORION: I like being furry.

3067
02:52:53,462 --> 02:52:55,993
SAM: Well then, no. I'm still punishing you.

3068
02:52:55,993 --> 02:52:59,466
(laughter)

3069
02:52:59,535 --> 02:53:02,661
ORION: That's fine. Have your fun tonight,
people, you will have your licking in the

3070
02:53:02,661 --> 02:53:04,667
morning. I go to sleep.

3071
02:53:04,667 --> 02:53:09,843
MATT: All right. You guys all go to rest for the
evening, the best rest you've had in a long time,

3072
02:53:09,843 --> 02:53:12,362
your beds are comfortable, well set, it's a warm
interior.

3073
02:53:12,362 --> 02:53:15,833
ASHLEY: I'm starfished on my bed.

3074
02:53:15,833 --> 02:53:24,281
MATT: This is the first time in a while that Pike,
you've been able to sleep without your armor on,

3075
02:53:24,281 --> 02:53:25,493
and it's so nice.

3076
02:53:25,493 --> 02:53:27,559
LAURA: That's great.

3077
02:53:27,559 --> 02:53:36,915
MATT: You sleep hard, you sleep for an extended
period, eventually you all begin to rouse, as you

3078
02:53:36,915 --> 02:53:40,423
all wake up, the smell of fresh breakfast food is
already coming to--

3079
02:53:40,423 --> 02:53:42,632
LAURA: That and Pike's stank from her armor.

3080
02:53:42,632 --> 02:53:45,789
MATT: Yeah, you're going to have to wash that
armor, girl.

3081
02:53:45,789 --> 02:53:48,433
TRAVIS: It's like when you take a cast off, you're
like, ugh.

3082
02:53:48,433 --> 02:53:49,420
MATT: It's bad.

3083
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:52,269
MARISHA: Actually, is there a bath house in the
village?

3084
02:53:52,269 --> 02:53:54,921
MATT: You haven't inquired. You could ask around
if you want.

3085
02:53:54,921 --> 02:53:57,590
MARISHA: We should have a girls' day at the bath
house.

3086
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:59,125
ORION: I woke up and took a dirt bath.

3087
02:53:59,125 --> 02:54:02,528
LIAM: You're not a rat, though.

3088
02:54:02,528 --> 02:54:04,346
MATT: Yeah. Oh, but he didn't transform you,
though.

3089
02:54:04,346 --> 02:54:05,306
ORION: Huh?

3090
02:54:05,306 --> 02:54:06,076
MATT: He didn't transform you.

3091
02:54:06,076 --> 02:54:07,170
ORION: I know, in lizard form.

3092
02:54:07,170 --> 02:54:08,173
SAM: Gross.

3093
02:54:08,173 --> 02:54:09,063
ORION: In my form.

3094
02:54:09,063 --> 02:54:10,071
TALIESIN: That's awesome.

3095
02:54:10,071 --> 02:54:12,050
ORION: Scales, you rub it off with clay?

3096
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:14,711
MATT: Yeah, there you go. Out in the front of the
Keep.

3097
02:54:14,779 --> 02:54:15,729
LAURA: Gross!

3098
02:54:15,729 --> 02:54:17,280
ORION: I have a little dirt in my room.

3099
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:18,843
LAURA: A little pile of grossness.

3100
02:54:18,843 --> 02:54:22,255
LIAM: We just don't fear for our lives for the
first time.

3101
02:54:22,255 --> 02:54:24,780
SAM: Let's go down and have our meeting.

3102
02:54:24,780 --> 02:54:29,154
MATT: So you guys head down into the dining room
again, Kima's still standing there with the maul,

3103
02:54:29,154 --> 02:54:34,457
left where she was. Grog is still face-down like
on the table, grabbed the plate up against his

3104
02:54:34,457 --> 02:54:44,517
face with mashed potatoes across his cheek. Across the way
at the far table, you see Cordell and Shayne are both

3105
02:54:44,566 --> 02:54:48,391
finishing their breakfast, and are sitting there
at the table with their arms kind of gathering as

3106
02:54:48,391 --> 02:54:55,728
you enter. "Morning!" "Morning." And they both
kind of finish their meal. Get up and stand up.

3107
02:54:55,728 --> 02:55:03,466
"Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it." "I think
our shift is done." She pats Cordell and they both

3108
02:55:03,632 --> 02:55:05,430
get up and they exit out.

3109
02:55:05,430 --> 02:55:08,965
LAURA: Have a good night! I know, I know, but
they're sleeping.

3110
02:55:09,015 --> 02:55:15,639
TRAVIS: I start awake with food on my face and I
wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream

3111
02:55:15,639 --> 02:55:18,492
"about two walking testicles that were hurting my
mind."

3112
02:55:18,492 --> 02:55:19,843
SAM: That was no dream!

3113
02:55:19,843 --> 02:55:22,941
(laughter)

3114
02:55:22,941 --> 02:55:26,070
LIAM: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just
about to go to the hearth and get some ash and

3115
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:27,757
draw a penis on your head.

3116
02:55:27,757 --> 02:55:30,497
TRAVIS: I had a feeling something was coming.

3117
02:55:30,497 --> 02:55:32,395
LIAM: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a
promise.

3118
02:55:32,395 --> 02:55:36,045
ASHLEY: Where's the Bag of Holding?

3119
02:55:36,045 --> 02:55:37,555
TRAVIS: I've got it.

3120
02:55:37,555 --> 02:55:40,181
ASHLEY: Can you check in your bag to see if the
Horn is still there?

3121
02:55:40,232 --> 02:55:41,367
LAURA: And it's okay?

3122
02:55:41,367 --> 02:55:44,673
TRAVIS: I look in the bag of holding and I see a
Horn?

3123
02:55:44,738 --> 02:55:49,134
MATT: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You
imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out.

3124
02:55:49,298 --> 02:55:50,406
TALIESIN: Don't do that.

3125
02:55:50,406 --> 02:55:51,675
LAURA: How are we going to get it out of there?

3126
02:55:51,675 --> 02:55:53,236
ORION: I can.

3127
02:55:53,288 --> 02:55:54,689
ASHLEY: Can you tell if it's in there?

3128
02:55:54,689 --> 02:55:55,828
SAM: Can you teleport something out of a bag?

3129
02:55:55,828 --> 02:55:57,302
ORION: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and--

3130
02:55:57,302 --> 02:56:00,503
LAURA: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make
sure it's still there and okay?

3131
02:56:00,503 --> 02:56:03,504
MATT: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the
Horn out--

3132
02:56:03,504 --> 02:56:05,434
ORION: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there.
I'm not doing that right now.

3133
02:56:05,434 --> 02:56:07,030
LAURA: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure
it's okay.

3134
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:08,074
ORION: I'm pretty sure it's there.

3135
02:56:08,074 --> 02:56:09,412
LAURA: But I want to make sure.

3136
02:56:09,412 --> 02:56:16,365
SAM: All right, I will check with Mage Hand or
whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah,

3137
02:56:16,365 --> 02:56:17,464
I'll Mage Hand it.

3138
02:56:17,464 --> 02:56:22,569
MATT: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out,
you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a

3139
02:56:22,635 --> 02:56:24,167
second, it moves very slowly.

3140
02:56:24,167 --> 02:56:25,978
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it back in.

3141
02:56:25,978 --> 02:56:27,935
MATT: Put it back in the bag.

3142
02:56:27,935 --> 02:56:32,768
TRAVIS: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to
go down to the, what is it, the temple

3143
02:56:32,768 --> 02:56:33,973
below the thingie?

3144
02:56:33,973 --> 02:56:35,830
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.

3145
02:56:35,830 --> 02:56:39,935
TRAVIS: All right, I'm going to go play in the
dark with myself. That sounded wrong.

3146
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:45,017
MATT: Okay, so you head down into the temple to
Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a

3147
02:56:45,017 --> 02:56:51,264
giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with
trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of

3148
02:56:51,264 --> 02:56:56,384
wooden kind of long benches set up towards this,
the altar in the center, it's beautiful,

3149
02:56:56,384 --> 02:57:00,513
especially this time of day, it's close to noon
right now so the sun's streaking through the top

3150
02:57:00,513 --> 02:57:07,125
of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs
of the two trees that are closest to the entrance.

3151
02:57:07,125 --> 02:57:09,701
It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are
moved.

3152
02:57:09,701 --> 02:57:14,991
TRAVIS: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the
Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil

3153
02:57:14,991 --> 02:57:19,557
that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I
just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.

3154
02:57:19,557 --> 02:57:23,781
MATT: All right. So while he's down there, the rest of
you guys, what're you doing?

3155
02:57:23,847 --> 02:57:25,646
ORION: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation
in my room.

3156
02:57:25,646 --> 02:57:27,055
MATT: Okay.

3157
02:57:27,055 --> 02:57:31,701
ORION: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first,
I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then

3158
02:57:31,701 --> 02:57:34,197
I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of
Teleportation.

3159
02:57:34,197 --> 02:57:36,070
MATT: Okay. Tiberius is gone.

3160
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:37,253
SAM: Let's heal Kima.

3161
02:57:37,253 --> 02:57:38,629
LAURA: You just left us?

3162
02:57:38,629 --> 02:57:40,938
ORION: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose
Draconia.

3163
02:57:40,938 --> 02:57:42,811
MATT: Tiberius is gone.

3164
02:57:42,811 --> 02:57:47,477
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima
and--

3165
02:57:47,477 --> 02:57:50,526
TALIESIN: We're going to face her towards the
wall.

3166
02:57:50,526 --> 02:57:51,931
ASHLEY: Face her towards the wall.

3167
02:57:51,931 --> 02:57:52,752
LIAM: Good idea.

3168
02:57:52,752 --> 02:57:54,046
ASHLEY: Or towards something happy.

3169
02:57:54,046 --> 02:57:56,030
TALIESIN: We're ready to pull you away when she
starts to move.

3170
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:57,317
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. So.

3171
02:57:57,317 --> 02:57:58,459
MARISHA: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?

3172
02:57:58,459 --> 02:57:59,526
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Yeah.

3173
02:57:59,526 --> 02:58:00,914
MARISHA: No, I thought we were going to talk to
Allura first.

3174
02:58:00,914 --> 02:58:02,974
LAURA: No, we're going to talk to her first.

3175
02:58:02,974 --> 02:58:04,823
MARISHA: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going
to do that thing.

3176
02:58:04,823 --> 02:58:06,125
LAURA: You were drunk, it's okay.

3177
02:58:06,125 --> 02:58:09,863
MARISHA: That's right, I was probably tipsy,
sorry. We came up with like

3178
02:58:09,863 --> 02:58:11,365
eight plans last night.

3179
02:58:11,365 --> 02:58:12,574
LAURA: You were so drunk.

3180
02:58:12,574 --> 02:58:14,274
SAM: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one
who likes her.

3181
02:58:14,274 --> 02:58:18,480
TRAVIS: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.

3182
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:23,499
ASHLEY: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.

3183
02:58:23,499 --> 02:58:24,599
LAURA: And then run away!

3184
02:58:24,599 --> 02:58:27,909
MATT: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of
Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly

3185
02:58:27,909 --> 02:58:32,906
her entire form goes back to flesh. As she
finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound)

3186
02:58:32,906 --> 02:58:37,850
against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back
for a second, confused, and looks over her

3187
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:39,014
shoulder at the rest of you.

3188
02:58:39,014 --> 02:58:43,156
SAM: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're
out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.

3189
02:58:43,156 --> 02:58:45,424
LAURA: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are
alive.

3190
02:58:45,424 --> 02:58:46,684
SAM: We lived.

3191
02:58:46,684 --> 02:58:50,158
MATT: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda
leans back against the wall.

3192
02:58:50,158 --> 02:58:52,681
MARISHA: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes
from breakfast.

3193
02:58:52,681 --> 02:59:00,537
MATT: "Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What
happened?" She's not even using utensils, she's

3194
02:59:00,537 --> 02:59:02,304
just like scooping it with her hand at this
point.

3195
02:59:02,304 --> 02:59:04,207
LAURA: So we killed K'Varn, right?

3196
02:59:04,207 --> 02:59:05,323
MATT: "Obviously."

3197
02:59:05,323 --> 02:59:12,309
SAM: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He
was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey,

3198
02:59:12,309 --> 02:59:13,996
you were right.

3199
02:59:13,996 --> 02:59:16,195
LAURA: But not before we were overrun with a bunch
of evil brothers of his.

3200
02:59:16,195 --> 02:59:17,865
TALIESIN: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.

3201
02:59:17,865 --> 02:59:19,456
LAURA: Hey, right, look at his hat.

3202
02:59:19,456 --> 02:59:26,320
SAM: We should've known all along, you were right,
we should've trusted you, sorry.

3203
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:31,711
MATT: "It's all right. He had his uses,
certainly."

3204
02:59:31,711 --> 02:59:35,358
LIAM: You were right, we were wrong, you're very
attractive, we're all quite ugly.

3205
02:59:35,358 --> 02:59:45,982
MATT: "That isn't necessary, but the compliment is
appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me

3206
02:59:46,036 --> 02:59:50,042
"back with you. You could have easily left me back
and I appreciate that you took the time."

3207
02:59:50,042 --> 02:59:55,136
SAM: So, you're alive, that's good because you
were sorta on a suicide mission.

3208
02:59:55,136 --> 02:59:57,159
MATT: "Not a suicide mission."

3209
02:59:57,159 --> 02:59:58,803
LAURA: What exactly was your mission, Kima?

3210
02:59:58,803 --> 03:00:00,545
MATT: "Where's the Horn?"

3211
03:00:00,545 --> 03:00:04,000
LAURA: Well, thing is, it's not here.

3212
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,783
MATT: "All right. It's not with the illithid, is
it?"

3213
03:00:07,834 --> 03:00:10,300
SAM: It's in a safe place.

3214
03:00:10,300 --> 03:00:12,370
MATT: "How safe?"

3215
03:00:12,370 --> 03:00:13,849
LAURA: Pretty safe.

3216
03:00:13,849 --> 03:00:15,681
TALIESIN: Why, what can it do?

3217
03:00:15,681 --> 03:00:21,779
MATT: She looks visually nervous and she goes--

3218
03:00:21,779 --> 03:00:25,420
LAURA: Nothing can touch it.

3219
03:00:25,420 --> 03:00:31,114
MATT: "Well, that's what the Order that originally
sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe

3220
03:00:31,114 --> 03:00:36,150
"temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But
we have to-- (sighs)"

3221
03:00:36,150 --> 03:00:42,769
LIAM: You saw your mission as a suicide mission,
but if you had secured it, what were your plans?

3222
03:00:42,769 --> 03:00:45,574
What was plan B? What were you going to do?

3223
03:00:45,574 --> 03:00:50,436
MATT: "Well, if I were to fall in the process of
trying to get the Horn, others would come after

3224
03:00:50,486 --> 03:00:53,792
"me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not
return they would send more."

3225
03:00:53,792 --> 03:00:55,019
LAURA: Can I insight?

3226
03:00:55,019 --> 03:01:04,136
MATT: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight.

3227
03:01:04,136 --> 03:01:06,732
LAURA: 19.

3228
03:01:06,732 --> 03:01:09,595
SAM: Ooh!

3229
03:01:09,595 --> 03:01:16,207
MARISHA: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.

3230
03:01:16,207 --> 03:01:20,608
SAM: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering
action doesn't come free.

3231
03:01:20,608 --> 03:01:22,889
MARISHA: How many subscribers away are we?

3232
03:01:22,889 --> 03:01:24,180
LUCAS: 38.

3233
03:01:24,180 --> 03:01:26,582
MARISHA: 38 subscribers.

3234
03:01:26,582 --> 03:01:28,321
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: That's a lot.

3235
03:01:28,321 --> 03:01:30,026
MARISHA: That is still a lot.

3236
03:01:30,026 --> 03:01:35,950
SAM: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where
you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.

3237
03:01:35,950 --> 03:01:45,578
MATT: And she goes, "So this Horn, which is one of
two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand

3238
03:01:45,578 --> 03:01:50,859
"or so years ago by those who originally cut it
from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it

3239
03:01:50,859 --> 03:01:57,366
"was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did
everything they could within their power to

3240
03:01:57,366 --> 03:02:02,101
"destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the
purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their

3241
03:02:02,101 --> 03:02:06,735
"knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal
both horns across the world from each other and

3242
03:02:06,735 --> 03:02:13,932
"forget that it even existed. Which worked well
until recently. It wasn't until these visions came

3243
03:02:13,932 --> 03:02:18,982
"to me and other members of my Order that we knew
that this, this was a thing, and me being the

3244
03:02:18,982 --> 03:02:24,165
"closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of
the essence I was to go in there with a team and

3245
03:02:24,165 --> 03:02:29,059
"retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the
very least we could convene and decide a safer

magical ways of forcing those of us who know how

3247
03:02:36,969 --> 03:02:42,333
"to forget. That would be the safest thing for it.
If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know,

3248
03:02:42,333 --> 03:02:48,631
"but that could also be sought after. We have
arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back

3249

"then, so, in the long run it needs to be
retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the

"Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws
like a beacon all darkness to it until something

"else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the
mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than

"he ever was."

3253
03:03:08,754 --> 03:03:10,598
LAURA: So the other Horn is still safe?

3254
03:03:10,598 --> 03:03:16,619
MATT: "As far as I know. The visions only gave me
access to where this one was. I can only assume

3255
03:03:16,619 --> 03:03:20,778
"that it's out there, but if someone else were to
find it, I would know that they probably have

3256
03:03:20,778 --> 03:03:24,640
"knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I
don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but

3257
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:29,993
"if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn,
what's to stop them from seeking the other?"

3258
03:03:29,993 --> 03:03:33,181
LIAM: Bummer.

3259
03:03:33,181 --> 03:03:34,929
MARISHA: Okay.

3260
03:03:34,929 --> 03:03:42,927
MATT: "Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive
and we're together, and where are we?"

3261
03:03:42,973 --> 03:03:45,266
LAURA: Oh, you're in our home.

3262
03:03:45,266 --> 03:03:47,237
SAM: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.

3263
03:03:47,237 --> 03:03:48,524
MATT: "We're in Emon?"

3264
03:03:48,524 --> 03:03:49,787
SAM: Yes.

3265
03:03:49,787 --> 03:03:53,369
MATT: "Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with
Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to

3266
03:03:53,369 --> 03:03:55,377
"do with this next."

3267
03:03:55,377 --> 03:04:06,781
SAM: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was
slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?

3268
03:04:06,781 --> 03:04:09,275
MATT: "What are you saying?"

3269
03:04:09,275 --> 03:04:17,702
SAM: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we,
there was a lot of bad guys down there that we

3270
03:04:17,702 --> 03:04:19,944
could not kill--

3271
03:04:19,944 --> 03:04:23,534
LAURA: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not
bad enough.

3272
03:04:23,534 --> 03:04:33,176
MATT: "I don't know much about the illithid
themselves, but they reside deep and they are not

3273
03:04:33,176 --> 03:04:40,058
"fans of the surface. I believe that it was
K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both

3274
03:04:40,113 --> 03:04:44,569
"in union with the duergar and pushing them towards
the siege. They spoke of something about bringing

3275
03:04:44,569 --> 03:04:49,793
"twilight to the surface world. I don't know what
that was about, but I fear what knowledge they

3276

"have if left alone. At the very least, I know that
they're probably having to return and lick their

3277
03:04:57,557 --> 03:05:01,520
"wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for
them, especially knowing that we're aware, to

3278
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:02,718
"attack now."

3279
03:05:02,718 --> 03:05:04,201
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

3280
03:05:04,201 --> 03:05:09,051
MATT: "But we can notify those in Kraghammer to
buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you

3281
03:05:09,103 --> 03:05:13,789
"took down there and my army as well, and that
should give us time to prepare if we choose to

3282
03:05:13,789 --> 03:05:16,230
"seize or at least seal them off."

3283
03:05:16,444 --> 03:05:17,960
LAURA: And your Order is what?

3284
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:19,417
MATT: "The Order of the Platinum Dragon."

3285
03:05:19,417 --> 03:05:23,903
LAURA: Right. That's a really good Order, right?

3286
03:05:23,952 --> 03:05:26,335
TALIESIN: History check, can I do a history
check?

3287
03:05:26,335 --> 03:05:27,466
MATT: It's a religion check.

3288
03:05:27,466 --> 03:05:29,191
TALIESIN: That's a religion check, not history
check?

3289
03:05:29,191 --> 03:05:30,254
MARISHA: Pike.

3290
03:05:30,254 --> 03:05:32,343
MATT: You could roll a history check and probably
gain some knowledge based on that, but the--

3291
03:05:32,343 --> 03:05:33,871
ASHLEY: Could I do it?

3292
03:05:33,871 --> 03:05:34,949
MATT: If you'd like to.

3293
03:05:34,949 --> 03:05:36,914
ASHLEY: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?

3294
03:05:36,914 --> 03:05:38,430
TALIESIN: I'm doing a history check, if you want
to do a religion check.

3295
03:05:38,430 --> 03:05:39,524
ASHLEY: I'll do a religion check.

3296
03:05:39,524 --> 03:05:40,536
MATT: Go for it.

3297
03:05:40,536 --> 03:05:41,759
TALIESIN: 22.

3298
03:05:41,759 --> 03:05:44,188
ASHLEY: So fucking close.

3299
03:05:44,188 --> 03:05:48,771
MATT: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with
the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it

3300
03:05:48,771 --> 03:05:52,900
up before, you've seen temples to it, but your
knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded

3301
03:05:52,900 --> 03:05:59,516
as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and
is primarily one of the great good gods of this

3302
03:05:59,516 --> 03:06:00,575
pantheon.

3303
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:03,133
TALIESIN: If we're going to trust anyone, I think
this is a good--

3304
03:06:03,133 --> 03:06:04,710
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.

3305
03:06:04,710 --> 03:06:09,363
TALIESIN: I trust the organization, they have a
sterling reputation.

3306
03:06:09,363 --> 03:06:20,051
MARISHA: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would
destroy the Horn?

3307
03:06:20,051 --> 03:06:28,171
MATT: "If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd
have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to

3308
03:06:28,171 --> 03:06:32,826
"the Council, we'd have to bring people that we
could trust and that had the capabilities of

3309
03:06:32,826 --> 03:06:36,337
"knowing if this were possible how we would go
about it. It's beyond my knowledge."

3310
03:06:36,337 --> 03:06:41,217
LIAM: I think what worries us is anyone coming in
contact with it would be corrupted.

3311
03:06:41,217 --> 03:06:42,936
MATT: "Don't go into contact with it."

3312
03:06:42,936 --> 03:06:43,769
LAURA: No.

3313
03:06:43,769 --> 03:06:44,736
LIAM: No, of course.

3314
03:06:44,736 --> 03:06:46,336
MARISHA: Just within range.

3315
03:06:46,336 --> 03:06:48,265
SAM: Yes, is proximity okay?

3316
03:06:48,265 --> 03:06:51,973
MATT: "I don't know, I saw it for as long as you
did."

3317
03:06:51,973 --> 03:06:53,643
LAURA: This could be bad.

3318
03:06:53,643 --> 03:06:56,086
SAM: Evil Grog?

3319
03:06:56,086 --> 03:06:59,210
LAURA: Kind of uncomfortable.

3320
03:06:59,210 --> 03:07:07,596
MATT: "The essence of most artifacts like this, it
goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued,

3321
03:07:07,596 --> 03:07:12,645
"bond with these artifacts, to attune with them
like any powerful magical item to truly gain its

3322
03:07:12,645 --> 03:07:15,890
"power, but that's not to say that itself does not
contain some sort of foul intelligence."

3323
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:17,747
ASHLEY: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?

3324
03:07:17,747 --> 03:07:19,769
MATT: Okay. So you walk your way down.

3325
03:07:19,769 --> 03:07:21,907
TRAVIS: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of
coconuts.

3326
03:07:21,907 --> 03:07:29,215
MATT: As you're walking past, as you walk past you
are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your

3327
03:07:29,215 --> 03:07:34,401
servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up
and says, "Dear, I wanted to let you know that a

3328
03:07:34,401 --> 03:07:39,459
"scroll came for you, some sort of a summons." And
he hands it to you.

3329
03:07:39,459 --> 03:07:40,526
ASHLEY: Me?

3330
03:07:40,526 --> 03:07:41,702
SAM: Probably jury duty.

3331
03:07:41,702 --> 03:07:43,406
MATT: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel.

3332
03:07:43,406 --> 03:07:44,723
TALIESIN: Always the worst time.

3333
03:07:44,723 --> 03:07:47,221
MATT: You open it up a little bit, it's not,
hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and

3334
03:07:47,221 --> 03:07:50,921
open it up. It's a summon to the Council of
Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk,

3335
03:07:50,921 --> 03:07:55,892
and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has
been notified of your arrival and would like to

3336
03:07:55,892 --> 03:07:58,768
see you at the council chambers posthaste.

3337
03:07:58,768 --> 03:08:13,375
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but
I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come

3338
03:08:13,437 --> 03:08:14,525
upstairs.

3339
03:08:14,602 --> 03:08:15,529
TRAVIS: Oh yeah?

3340
03:08:15,529 --> 03:08:16,531
MARISHA: That was for all of us?

3341
03:08:16,531 --> 03:08:17,200
LAURA: Yeah.

3342
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:18,104
MATT: It was addressed to Vox Machina.

3343
03:08:18,104 --> 03:08:18,962
TRAVIS: Is it clear?

3344
03:08:18,962 --> 03:08:20,774
ASHLEY: Just don't say anything yet, but just come
upstairs.

3345
03:08:20,774 --> 03:08:22,603
TRAVIS: Did she ask about me?

3346
03:08:22,603 --> 03:08:24,678
LAURA: She definitely did.

3347
03:08:24,678 --> 03:08:25,862
ASHLEY: She did, yeah.

3348
03:08:25,862 --> 03:08:29,790
TRAVIS: With my bald head.

3349
03:08:29,790 --> 03:08:35,384
MATT: All right. You make your way back in, Kima
finishes her meal, and you guys are chatting a

3350
03:08:35,384 --> 03:08:43,288
bit, she's just like, "All right, if I may ask,
how did you seal it? I feel uncomfortable knowing

3351
03:08:43,288 --> 03:08:46,622
"the process and that it's at least safe."

3352
03:08:46,622 --> 03:08:51,167
MARISHA: Oh, we have one of the best defense
mechanisms. Grog!

3353
03:08:51,167 --> 03:08:53,249
TRAVIS: Hello, Lady Kima.

3354
03:08:53,249 --> 03:08:56,931
LAURA: It's in a very secure magical item.

3355
03:08:56,931 --> 03:09:02,843
MATT: She glances at you and goes, "All right,
very well. Just be mindful that you don't go

3356
03:09:03,010 --> 03:09:04,013
"reaching in there."

3357
03:09:04,013 --> 03:09:10,795
MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make
little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around

3358
03:09:10,795 --> 03:09:13,634
him. "Grog!"

3359
03:09:13,634 --> 03:09:18,999
MATT: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt
and sweat, still in the golden armor that she

3360
03:09:18,999 --> 03:09:23,602
wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in
the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried

3361
03:09:23,602 --> 03:09:25,692
mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda
gives--

3362
03:09:25,692 --> 03:09:27,424
LAURA: So she's covered in food as well.

3363
03:09:27,424 --> 03:09:32,793
MATT: (laughs) Gives you a look as you're walking in
like. "It's good to see you alive, friend."

3364
03:09:32,952 --> 03:09:35,799
TRAVIS: Yeah, more than alive, I think.

3365
03:09:35,799 --> 03:09:43,838
ASHLEY: And also, he actually pulled you out of
the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out

3366
03:09:43,838 --> 03:09:46,184
of the whole place.

3367
03:09:46,184 --> 03:09:48,768
TRAVIS: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.

3368
03:09:48,768 --> 03:09:55,268
MATT: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off
her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps

3369
03:09:55,268 --> 03:10:00,359
right before you, looking up towards your face and
says, "I thank you, friend Grog."

3370
03:10:00,359 --> 03:10:02,673
LAURA: Friendzoned!

3371
03:10:02,673 --> 03:10:06,465
MATT: And then reaches out and gives you a big
hug.

3372
03:10:06,529 --> 03:10:12,046
LIAM: Plus he decided not to put you in the
magical bag when you were a statue.

3373
03:10:12,046 --> 03:10:18,755
MATT: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives
you a keen look and goes, "Also appreciated."

3374
03:10:18,755 --> 03:10:20,380
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, you know.

3375
03:10:20,380 --> 03:10:22,151
LAURA: Oh my god, thank god.

3376
03:10:22,151 --> 03:10:30,836
SAM: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura
and we'll continue the conversation

3377
03:10:30,836 --> 03:10:32,519
from there, I guess.

3378
03:10:32,519 --> 03:10:36,990
MATT: "Please, I'd love to see her, it's been too
long. All right, I'm going to, is there a room I

3379
03:10:36,990 --> 03:10:37,998
"could rest?"

3380
03:10:37,998 --> 03:10:38,838
TALIESIN: Yes.

3381
03:10:38,838 --> 03:10:39,894
TRAVIS: You could use my room.

3382
03:10:39,894 --> 03:10:41,953
TALIESIN: There's a guest room.

3383
03:10:41,953 --> 03:10:45,204
LAURA: Yes, we have a guest room.

3384
03:10:45,204 --> 03:10:47,864
SAM: We should use it.

3385

MARISHA: Sweet.

3415
03:11:56,455 --> 03:12:01,188
ZAC: Man, I'll give you an "aren't we clever"
sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We

3416
03:12:01,188 --> 03:12:03,336
also have some donations to read off.

3417

MATT: All right.

3422
03:12:20,169 --> 03:12:25,955
ZAC: If you want to go ahead and, actually I don't
know if she wanted this to be read. Oh, okay, but

3423
03:12:25,955 --> 03:12:30,777
this is cool. Do you want to hand me those
disposable cameras? Where did he go?

3424
03:12:30,831 --> 03:12:32,885
Oh, I lost him.

3425
03:12:32,885 --> 03:12:36,644

sent you a disposable camera. Basically I had this

3426
03:12:36,644 --> 03:12:39,579
"idea to send this to you and have you guys go
crazy, fill up the camera with random shenanigans,

"send you guys a set back once they're developed."

3431
