00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,418
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:06,625
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,564
ALL: Dungeons and Dragons!

4
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:10,957
MATT: Just like that. Durr and Durr.

5
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:12,566
ASHLEY: How der der der der.

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:18,208
MATT: Indeed. So. Before we jump into the story
for this evening, let's go ahead and get through

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:23,856
our announcements. First and foremost, we have a
fantastic sponsor for tonight's episode. Backblaze

8
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:31,107
has returned to us. Good friends to the show, and
Sam, you wanted to talk a little bit about this?

9
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:41,602
SAM: I haven't done this in a while. Little rusty.
But Backblaze. Nervous. Backblaze is such an

10
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:46,910
important sponsor, I didn't want to just do a
commercial for them, I wanted to do an

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,873
infomercial. Maestro?

12
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:52,414
[infomercial music]

13
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:57,395
SAM: Hi, everybody, I'm Sam Riegel and welcome to
Late-Night Deals. Guys, online backup systems.

14
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:04,401
Just the sound of it gives me a headache. It's
always so complicated, expensive, and frustrating.

15
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:09,129
Am I right? Usually, when you back up your data,
you look like this guy.

16
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:18,702
TALIESIN: C drive? USB port? HTTP? Forward slash?
Ugh! Speak English! All these wires and cables! I

17
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:20,497
can't take it anymore!

18
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:26,513
SAM: But now there's Backblaze, a cloud-based
backup system that's so easy, you'll look like

19
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:27,995
this gal.

20
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:36,454
MARISHA: And finished. Using Backblaze makes me
feel so awesome and cool and hip and young and

21
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:46,202
free and attractive and empowered and invincible.
It's so easy, even a total jackass could use it.

22
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:52,131
SAM: That's right, Marisha, even a total jackass
can use it, and I'm living proof. Taliesin,

23
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:58,131
Backblaze backs up photos, documents, fanfic, and
all your user data, and here's the best part. How

24
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,913
much do you think it costs?

25
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:04,852
TALIESIN: For a system like that? It's got to
cost, what? $200, maybe? $300 a month?

26
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:05,711
SAM: Nope.

27
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:10,220
MARISHA: That sounds too low. I'm going to guess
$9,000 a month.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,703
SAM: Nope. Keep guessing.

29
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:13,980
TALIESIN: $100,000 a month!

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,016
SAM: Not even close. If you order now, you'll get
Backblaze for just five dollars a month for

31
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,217
unlimited and unfryable backup.

32
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:24,439
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: Five dollars? That's
nothing!

33
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,138
TALIESIN: I literally burn five-dollar bills to
stay warm on chilly nights.

34
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:34,185
MARISHA: Oh, me too. Oh, I'm so convinced. But
Sam, how do I sign up?

35
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:38,678
SAM: Oh, it's simple, Marish. Go to
backblaze.com/criticalrole and you'll get a

36
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,561
two-week free trial.

37
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,335
TALIESIN: What was that URL again?

38
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,621
SAM: backblaze.com/criticalrole!

39
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,482
MARISHA: One more time.

40
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,850
SAM: backblaze.com/criticalrole!

41
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,801
TALIESIN: One more time.

42
00:02:51,801 --> 00:03:00,725
SAM: backblaze.com/criticalrole! There's no end. I
didn't write an end to the bit. That's it. It's

43
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:04,070
over. Yay! And scene.

44
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,234
TRAVIS: Wow.

45
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:10,061
SAM: Thank you, guys.

46
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:15,404
TALIESIN: I'm caught in wires. There we are.

47
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:21,676
MATT: Thank you very much, Sam. Also, anyone who
gives Backblaze a try through May will also be

48
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:28,439
entered to win a contest to win some signed art,
signed by all of us. And if you've already tried

49
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,587
it, you've also already been entered, so don't
worry about that. Anyway, thank you so much,

50
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:41,132
Backblaze. Go check it out. And thank you. All
righty. Wow. I don't want to follow that up.

51
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:45,564
Laura, any merch news?

52
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:50,416
LAURA: Oh, just the same merch news as always.
We've got these amazing Vox Machina t-shirts in

53
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,652
the store.

54
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,580
SAM: Is someone wearing?

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,230
LAURA: Yev is wearing it, from Backblaze. But
nobody here is, but they're so soft and they're

56
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,966
amazing. We also have hoodies and hats and patches
and nail wraps and stickers.

57
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,285
MATT: Did you guys want to thank the awesome
Melissa Kelp for her design, by the way?

58
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:14,928
LAURA: Yes! Who designed Vox Machina, and that was
in our original fan contest that we did. We had

59
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:21,279
that awesome design that was so cool that we
decided to make that design, as well.

60
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,116
MATT: Thank you, Melissa.

61
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,540
TRAVIS: Thank you, Melissa!

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,102
LAURA: (sings) Amazing job!

63
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:29,031
MATT: All right. Wednesday Club, Taliesin.

64
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:35,828
TALIESIN: We don't actually have an official theme
yet, but I have a strong sensation that it's

65
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:39,171
probably going to be something about Riverdale. I
get the vibe that we might be going to Riverdale.

66
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:49,794
There might be a teenage witch. Maybe a band. I
don't know. We'll see. It's not official yet, but

67
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,287
I'm working on it.

68
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:58,893
MATT: Elrond of Riverdale. Thank you very much,
Taliesin. Marisha, Signal Boost.

69
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:05,219
MARISHA: It's Brian Compton from over at Nerdist.
(gasps) You got your Geek and Sundry in my

70
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,369
Nerdist.

71
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,237
TALIESIN: You got your Nerdist in my Geek and
Sundry.

72
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,296
MARISHA: You dick!

73
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:10,392
TALIESIN: That's so disgusting.

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,608
MARISHA: You fucking dick!

75
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:14,117
SAM: Jesus, this got dark really fast.

76
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:18,324
MATT: That and more you can look forward to at
MomoCon, as me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be

77
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:26,980
there in a couple weeks in Atlanta, Georgia. So
we'll see you guys there May 25th to 28th, and I

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,430
will be a guest at A-Kon June 8th-11th in Fort
Worth, Texas. For all you folks out there in the

79
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:34,880
Texas area, come say hi, that'll be fun.

80
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:36,650
TRAVIS: (muffled) Fort Worth, Texas?

81
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,459
MATT: Yes.

82
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,264
TRAVIS: (muffled) I went to college there!

83
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,028
MATT: You should come to your college.

84
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,153
TRAVIS: (muffled) No, I'm good.

85
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:47,538
MATT: Okay. And to finish this off. Talks Machina,
of course, we have starting next Tuesday about

86
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:53,676
this episode, hosted by our fantastic Brian Wayne
Foster. Make sure you submit your fanart and gif

87
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:58,562
of the week to possibly win some cool prizes.
Those will go to talksmachina@gmail.com. So.

88
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:06,253
Without further ado, friends, let's go ahead and
dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

89
00:06:06,253 --> 00:07:35,130
[dramatic music]

90
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:41,796
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. So. Picking up where we left off.

91
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:49,196
After Vox Machina had taken a year of peace and
activity to handle their own respective endeavors,

92
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:57,814
or communal endeavors, they discovered apparently
some family of Pike Trickfoot coming and knocking

93
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:03,299
at the door of Whitestone. A reunion with some of
her family she had not seen since she was a child,

94
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:09,325
coming in to impart her with the knowledge of a
terrible family blood-curse that had been haunting

95
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:15,108
them for ages and visions that were guided by her
uncle Ogden to the possibility that she carries

96
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:21,548
the same curse, and wanting to free the bloodline,
or at least Pike of this, they had to amass some

97
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:26,603
materials and make their way on a moonlit night to
the top of the Alabaster Sierras to complete the

98
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:32,032
ritual to exorcise this entity and destroy it.
After gathering the materials and traveling to the

99
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:38,178
top of the Salted Bluffs of the Alabaster Sierras,
the ritual was completed and the large, monstrous

100
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:46,606
black cloud and skull entity is summoned forth
from Pike's body, and you all leapt in to do

101
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:53,712
battle. However, partway into this fray, Vex
happened to realize that it was seemingly an

102
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:59,754
illusion. There was no ritual, there was no blood
curse, and this was a ploy from the family to make

103
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:07,200
a little cash off you guys. After some threats to
Uncle Ogden and nearly losing him off the edge of

104
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,078
a cliff, you made a deal to offer some money. In
exchange, you took your cousin JB under your wing,

105
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,915
and they were forced to leave and never return.
They accepted and went on their way, and with

106
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:26,826
that, we begin today's episode. So you guys have
been traveling down the side of the mountain, of

107
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:32,387
the Alabaster Sierras, returning late-night to the
city of Whitestone. What do you wish to do?

108
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:34,207
TRAVIS: Kill them all before we change our mind.

109
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,815
(laughter)

110
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:44,054
LAURA: Oh, can I cast Locate Object and try to
find that diamond that he chucked over the side?

111
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,327
MATT: What's the range on Locate Object?

112
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,791
TRAVIS: Was it a thousand-foot cliff?

113
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,405
TALIESIN: It was far down there.

114
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:57,292
LIAM: Well, I've probably got about 30 or 40
minutes left on the--

115
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:01,399
SAM: You could fly down. Some of us own flying
brooms.

116
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,616
LAURA: Yeah, we can fly down on flying brooms.

117
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,369
LIAM: Do that. Yeah? I can go swimming.

118
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,790
LAURA: Shit, I don't have my thing.

119
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,799
LIAM: Your thing?

120
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,334
LAURA: That says what the distance on Locate
Object is.

121
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:14,005
MATT: The distance is 1,000 feet of you.

122
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:18,882
LAURA: Okay, so can I get on my broom and cast it
and go try to find it down in the water?

123
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:24,164
MATT: Sure. It lasts for ten minutes.

124
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:24,955
LAURA: Okay.

125
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:31,170
MATT: I'll say, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

126
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:42,405
LAURA: I'm organizing my dice right now! 19!

127
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:53,239
MATT: 19. Okay. It takes you the better part of
the next ten minutes or so to even get a blip on

128
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:58,839
your arcane radar. And you suddenly sense as
you're coasting along the very base of the surf

129
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,104
where the waters crash against the rocks, the tide
has been coming in with the full moon, and you can

130
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:10,265
see now the water itself is rough and just
smashing into the side of the cliff base. You get

131
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:16,098
a small glimmer, a small beacon, a draw to you
like a small pulling under the waves. And you

132
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:20,942
sense about maybe 65 feet down, there it is.

133
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,112
LAURA: 65 feet.

134
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:23,219
TRAVIS: Under the water.

135
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:24,490
MATT: Under the water.

136
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,260
TRAVIS: That's three diving tanks for competitive
diving.

137
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,537
LAURA: So probably couldn't do it unless I have
breathing underwater?

138
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,878
LIAM: Or your friend Keyleth.

139
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:38,007
LAURA: She's up top. Would I remember the spot in
the fucking water if I went up and got her and

140
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,871
brought her back down? Do I have enough time to do
it?

141
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:42,461
MATT: You could try and remember it and come
back.

142
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:44,229
SAM: It's 1,000.

143
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,777
LAURA: It's 1,500!

144
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,240
TALIESIN: Are we within earpiece-shot?

145
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
MATT: Not with her right now. You'd have to go
back up.

146
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,792
LAURA: Okay. I fly straight up from the spot so I
don't lose it.

147
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:58,565
MATT: All right. You're pretty much on the cusp of
it. You've been a little flexible on the range of

148
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:01,565
them, but we'll say you get a little ways up.

149
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:04,559
LAURA: And I say, Keyleth! Can you swim?

150
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,219
MARISHA: (chuckles) Yes.

151
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,579
LAURA: Can you come help me get this diamond
back?

152
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,571
MARISHA: Oh, yeah! Yeah.

153
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:18,628
(laughter)

154
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:19,987
MARISHA: Am I on the cliff?

155
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:21,172
MATT: You're on top of the cliff, yeah.

156
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:22,403
MARISHA: Is she down?

157
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,492
MATT: Yeah.

158
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,747
LAURA: I can come-- Oh. Are you really?

159
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:26,851
MARISHA: Can I do it?

160
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,518
LAURA: That's a really high drop!

161
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:31,033
MARISHA: Can I do the Pocahontas swan dive?

162
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,697
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

163
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:36,371
MARISHA: I run and cliff dive!

164
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:39,033
LAURA: Oh Jesus. Oh no.

165
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,031
TALIESIN: (sings) Sail!

166
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,053
MARISHA: (sings) Sail!

167
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,715
(laughter)

168
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,346
LAURA: Oh no.

169
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:47,564
MARISHA: 11.

170
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:53,040
MATT: Okay. You get a few feet past the cliff
edge. Not a majestic jump and the cliff is not

171
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,334
completely sheer; it does slightly angle outwards.
So you gently leap off, and as you're falling you

172
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:03,556
can see you probably have, I'd say about 300 feet
or so before you're going to hit rock.

173
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:04,718
MARISHA: I'm going to hit rock?

174
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:10,178
MATT: The cliff is not perfectly vertical. It's a
little bit angled and you're heading down to hit

175
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,083
the rock.

176
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:17,259
MARISHA: I go, oops! And can I do a Gust against
the cliff wall to push me back a little bit

177
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,407
further?

178
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:21,802
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom check. This is a
straight wisdom modifier check.

179
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:28,443
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! Just straight wisdom
modifier? 20.

180
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:38,268
MATT: Okay. Like a gentle fart, you push yourself
a little ways from the cliff. I'll say it does

181
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:43,431
just enough of a shove where the trajectory
changes slightly. You may or may not be right

182
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:48,713
where the rock hits the surf. You can test it or
not. It's up to you.

183
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:49,862
TRAVIS: Test it!

184
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,487
TALIESIN: And this was the end.

185
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:54,840
LAURA: Kiki, don't kill yourself over this rock!

186
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,401
LIAM: It was nice being in a couple.

187
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:01,453
MARISHA: At the last minute, I'm going to
(panicked squealing). And turn into a goldfish.

188
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:04,364
TRAVIS: Before you hit the water?

189
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:05,609
SAM: Or the rock?

190
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:13,746
MARISHA: Well, I'm assuming the goldfish would
make it easier to hit water.

191
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:16,073
LAURA: Yeah, but you're going to hit rock!

192
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:21,372
SAM: Goldfish are not magnetically attracted to
water. They still just fall.

193
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:24,603
LAURA: What about flying fish or something, so you
can maybe--

194
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:27,767
MARISHA: I don't think flying fish actually fly,
though.

195
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,326
LAURA: No, but they got big fins.

196
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,484
TRAVIS: They do glide.

197
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:36,690
MATT: Regardless, as you turn into a goldfish,
rocketing towards the base of the water...

198
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:42,574
LAURA and SAM: Oh no.

199
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,704
TRAVIS: He's taking a picture of it!

200
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:48,388
MATT: No, I'm not. This is too many dice for me to
roll.

201
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,322
(gasping)

202
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,302
ASHLEY: What?

203
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,795
MARISHA: I would just pop back to myself. I
wouldn't die.

204
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,778
MATT: And then any additional damage would go over
into your--

205
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:56,888
MARISHA: No, I know.

206
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,205
TRAVIS: There's too many dice to roll, Marisha.

207
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:03,128
MARISHA: No, it's fine! We're gods!

208
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:07,727
LAURA: Are we? She says as she dies on the rocks.

209
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:11,257
TRAVIS: Why would you even tempt that shit?

210
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:14,454
TALIESIN: Why am I drinking your coffee? I'm going
to stop right now.

211
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:19,648
SAM: Oh boy.

212
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:24,378
LAURA: Oh no. What is he doing? No. Seriously,
though. What if she just died?

213
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,645
MARISHA: That would be kind of amazing.

214
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,662
MATT: You took 363 points of damage.

215
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:34,716
MARISHA: You are lying. You are lying! By hitting
rocks?

216
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:41,913
MATT: By hitting rocks at terminal velocity. It's
1d6 per ten feet falling. Keyleth scatters across

217
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:44,897
the edge of the rock. And just crumples into the
surf and is now floating.

218
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:49,058
MARISHA: Wait! What? You are lying!

219
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:50,433
MATT: No! You just--

220
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:54,498
SAM: What does that mean? That's below her total
hit points!

221
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,170
TRAVIS: That's instant death.

222
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,250
MATT: No, she's dead. Keyleth is dead and floating
in the water.

223
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,951
SAM: Unrevivable death?

224
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,810
MATT: Probably revivable. You've just got to
retrieve the body.

225
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,023
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh my god!

226
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:11,623
SAM: Wait! Vex! I gave you a coin!

227
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:13,697
LAURA: A Revivify coin!

228
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:17,865
MARISHA: Wait! I thought you were trying to make
it out like I'd still hit water!

229
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:21,697
MATT: I said the distance you jumped and then
pushed--

230
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:31,295
TRAVIS: You jumped from 1,000 feet in the air.
Totally logical! You can't even see the water or

231
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:34,338
rocks, but you're like, yep! I've got this,
bitch!

232
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:39,721
LIAM: I am having the best conversation with JB
right now.

233
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:45,940
MARISHA: This is the best thing that's ever
happened!

234
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,246
LAURA: Wait, but here's the thing, do I have to
roll if I use the coin?

235
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:57,674
MATT: And now, officially, every member of Vox
Machina has died. Most in battle, or some danger.

236
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:59,344
TRAVIS: That took care of it!

237
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,822
SAM: You broke the seal!

238
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:08,309
MARISHA: Wait! Was I supposed to turn into a
flying creature? And be safe from this?

239
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,825
MATT: That's up to you! That's literally your
choice!

240
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:17,830
LIAM: Okay. I am starting to sweat! Who sees it? I
don't see it!

241
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:27,197
MATT: The only person that sees it is Vex. Vex,
you watch as Keyleth-- (jump, poof, splat). It's a

242
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:32,985
scatter of red mess. And you see her floating in
the water.

243
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:37,718
ASHLEY: It's only 7:15!

244
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:41,065
MATT: I know! This was not in my plan!

245
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:45,990
ASHLEY: Okay. Go get her!

246
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:50,586
LAURA: I go fly down there! Is she a body, at
least?

247
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:54,917
SAM: Because she hit as the goldfish!

248
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:59,397
MATT: Yes, and the goldfish which has a hit
point.

249
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:00,819
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

250
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:05,402
MATT: Which then made the other 324 hit points go
over to Marisha.

251
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:06,734
SAM: Sure.

252
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:10,387
TRAVIS: So the goldfish turned into orange
marmalade?

253
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:16,911
LIAM: It was like a magic trick! It was like a
fish turned into a corpse!

254
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:23,417
LAURA: Can I use my coin that Tary gave me? My
coin of Revivify on her?

255
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:27,085
MATT: Because you gave it to her before the
battle, right? Yes, you can.

256
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:32,904
LAURA: Okay. I do that. Don't touch my dice in
anger!

257
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,583
LIAM: I'm not angry!

258
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,412
LAURA: I don't know. How do I do it?

259
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:43,114
MATT: Go ahead and roll a straight wisdom check.

260
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:44,615
LAURA: A wisdom check?

261
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,980
MATT: Yes.

262
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,886
LAURA: (yells) I'm so nervous!

263
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:51,071
ASHLEY: Stop laughing, Travis! Stop it!

264
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:54,796
LAURA: Okay.

265
00:18:54,796 --> 00:19:00,028
TRAVIS: I mean, you can't feel bad about it.

266
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,156
MARISHA: I thought I was going to hit water and it
would be cool!

267
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:04,255
LAURA: 18.

268
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:11,143
MATT: 18. Okay. As you go down and pull her out of
the water, her soaked red hair covers her face,

269
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:14,630
and that's probably a good thing. As you're a
little scared to see--

270
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,452
TRAVIS: It's like a red-haired The Ring.

271
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:25,441
MATT: And with that, you instinctively begin to
seize up, and you sob, and then you realize: the

272
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:29,084
coin! And you fumble for it in your pocket, and
you hear the waves crashing below you. And you

273
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:33,242
pull it out and you hold it in your palm. And you
feel it glowing, warm in your hand as you press it

274
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:40,654
against the back of Keyleth's broken body. And you
watch as the warmth passes from the coin through

275
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:45,527
her back. And as it does, you watch as her broken
limbs all snap back into place.

276
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:49,729
(laughter/gagging)

277
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,086
MATT: And she begins to breathe again.

278
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:57,293
(laughter)

279
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:58,807
LIAM: What the shit is this show?

280
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:02,302
MATT: I don't know! This was not in the--

281
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,997
MARISHA: (screaming) That was higher than I
thought!

282
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:13,303
MATT: Keyleth, by the way, looks wrecked. She's
still scratched everywhere, she's covered in

283
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:16,395
blood, but she's alive at one hit point.

284
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:24,967
LAURA: Kiki, that was really, really stupid. I put
my hands on both sides of her face and cast Cure

285
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,457
Wounds at 4th level. Oh, no! At 3rd level, because
I used Grasping Vine last time.

286
00:20:29,457 --> 00:20:32,244
MATT: Yeah, 3rd level. Okay. So 3d8 plus your
wisdom modifier.

287
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:38,844
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

288
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,131
SAM: I better go check on them. I'll dive off the
cliff.

289
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,521
(laughter)

290
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,833
TRAVIS: Yeah. Good. Just a little drop.

291
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,763
MATT: That was a beautiful D&amp;D moment, right
there.

292
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:48,907
LAURA: Oh my god.

293
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:55,376
LIAM: Vax is sitting with JB right now, going
like, so what was Pike like when she was really

294
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,009
little, little for a gnome?

295
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:00,150
TALIESIN: We all were wearing the necklace, so we
all got a beep.

296
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,140
MATT: You did, briefly.

297
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,520
LIAM: I was really paying attention to JB,
though.

298
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,532
TRAVIS: Is yours broken? I think mine's broken!

299
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,194
TALIESIN: I felt something.

300
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:11,748
LAURA: Keyleth.

301
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:15,646
MARISHA: I've been really stressed out here
lately, and that might have been very impulsive.

302
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:21,434
And I might have been blowing off some steam. And
I'm really sorry! (crying) I thought it was going

303
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:23,799
to be fine! I didn't know there was going to be
rocks!

304
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,709
LAURA: Maybe next time you're diving off a cliff,
turn into a bird.

305
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,654
MARISHA: Oh?

306
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,691
LAURA: Yeah.

307
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:29,507
MARISHA: It might have been a last-minute panic.

308
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,395
LAURA: I'm glad you're back.

309
00:21:31,395 --> 00:21:33,706
MARISHA: Thanks, that was--

310
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:39,644
LAURA: You know what? Let's not even worry about
that coin there. I mean the diamond. I feel like,

311
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:40,649
maybe--

312
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:44,124
MARISHA: I could go get it now! It's fine. I'm
here now.

313
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:46,198
LAURA: Oh my god.

314
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:52,975
MARISHA: I feel really bad, because-- I feel bad
about that. I'm sorry.

315
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:59,926
LAURA: I think maybe this is a lesson learned in
what is worth risking our lives for.

316
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,071
TRAVIS: Is there a cloud of red in the water?

317
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:08,985
MATT: There was, but the waves are crashing pretty
heavy. Luckily, Vex grabbed her immediately,

318
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:14,833
because otherwise her body would have been thrown
under the rocks again by the surf. I just

319
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,735
explained the ocean to you before you jumped!
That's what would have happened!

320
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:20,051
TRAVIS: A thousand feet was all you needed.

321
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:24,580
TALIESIN: We have some amazing physics books that
we will actually get into at some point.

322
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,464
LAURA: How about you just climb onto the broom.
Don't worry about flying right now.

323
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:30,884
MARISHA: I can go get the thing.

324
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,098
LAURA: We're just going up.

325
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,261
MARISHA: I still have a Beast Shape left.

326
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,397
LAURA: We're just going to go up.

327
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,789
MARISHA: Okay.

328
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,240
LAURA: We're leaving.

329
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,661
TRAVIS: She's covered in gore, right?

330
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,227
MATT: Okay. Yeah, she's covered in blood.

331
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:46,038
LAURA: Price paid, I think.

332
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:54,604
MATT: So as you guys are talking to JB, who's
still stunned by the whole thing-- all of this

333
00:22:54,604 --> 00:23:00,940
happened pretty quickly, so she's not necessarily
opening up entirely, but she's like, "Well. You

334
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,814
"know, we were both troublemakers."

335
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:09,965
LIAM: Yeah! Because she's got a wild streak. Now,
does that run in the family, or is that just her

336
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,002
and you?

337
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:16,276
MATT: "Oh, that definitely runs in the family."
She looks over to you Pike, again, and is like,

338
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:19,274
"I am so sorry. I didn't--"

339
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,464
ASHLEY: It's okay.

340
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:24,478
MATT: "I'll try and make it up to you."

341
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:28,817
ASHLEY: Just know I don't want you to-- if you
don't want to stay here, you don't have to stay

342
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:34,615
here. I'm not holding you here against your will
in any way, but I would love for you to stay

343
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:37,593
because I would love to get to know you better.

344
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:44,765
MATT: "How could I say no? (chuckles) I'll stay
until you need me to leave."

345
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,416
ASHLEY: Okay.

346
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:51,909
MATT: At which point, you watch as Vex and Keyleth
and the broom come up and land on the cliffside.

347
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:54,349
TALIESIN: Have you two found that diamond-- oh,
sweet Pelor!

348
00:23:54,349 --> 00:24:00,984
LAURA: You know what? We're not going to worry
about the diamond right now. Yeah, let's just

349
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:07,959
maybe take a moment and recover from that battle
which was so hard on everyone.

350
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,309
ASHLEY: What happened?

351
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,145
LIAM: What? You-- What?

352
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:15,002
LAURA: She's fine. She's fine!

353
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,694
SAM: She's more blood than person.

354
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:20,629
ASHLEY: Do we need to fix anything?

355
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:23,331
LAURA: Maybe, Pike. If you can do a little--

356
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,756
ASHLEY: Yes! Cure Wounds!

357
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:25,609
LAURA: (whispers) Tary!

358
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:26,394
SAM: What?

359
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:27,629
LAURA: (whispers) I used your coin.

360
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:28,776
SAM: Oh! Oh.

361
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,690
LAURA: I know!

362
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,455
SAM: I'm glad I gave it to you, then. Ooh.

363
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:39,893
MARISHA: It's fine. I can go back and get that
diamond now. I feel really bad right now!

364
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:43,866
TALIESIN: I think somebody's got a carpet ride
down the hill coming to them.

365
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:47,688
LIAM: I'm casting Lay on Hands for my piddly 20
hit points. What did you do?

366
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:59,058
MARISHA: I thought it'd be fun. I haven't had a
lot of fun here lately, okay? It felt like the old

367
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:03,352
days of when Vox Machina was back together,
because we've been away for a while.

368
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:06,923
ASHLEY: You just dove off, Free Willy-nilly?

369
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:12,133
LAURA: You know, those rocks came out of nowhere.
I thought you were in the clear, as well. All I

370
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,264
saw was Keyleth and then this little tiny fleck of
gold and then gone.

371
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,750
TRAVIS: Wait, did you miss? Did you hit?

372
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,424
LIAM: Did you die?!

373
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:25,594
MARISHA: It's fine.

374
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:29,815
LIAM: She looks like a fucking macabre mess! What
happened?!

375
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:34,800
ASHLEY: I forgot that that's what that was. I felt
a (whirring), you know?

376
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:41,520
MARISHA: It's been a lot of responsibility here
lately, and a lot of being an adult and so I was

377
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,296
like: Vox! We're reckless!

378
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:49,315
LIAM: That's what alcohol is for! Don't jump off
cliffs anymore, please!

379
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,350
TRAVIS: Yeah, you fucked up. That was crazy.

380
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,367
TALIESIN: I have to confess, I've been feeling a
bit stir-crazy myself. Not jump-off-cliffs

381
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:58,804
stir-crazy, dear god.

382
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,819
LIAM: And I turn her bloody face to you and say,
let this be a lesson to you, then!

383
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:07,103
TALIESIN: I'm just saying that I understand the
impulse. This was not necessarily the best

384
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:10,518
expression of it.

385
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:13,244
TRAVIS: We should go on a hunt. That's what we
need.

386
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:16,118
TALIESIN: I think let's take a nap and then maybe
go out--

387
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:22,684
LIAM: I start kissing the gory mess in my hands
all over her forehead.

388
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:26,523
MARISHA: That's gross. Don't.

389
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:29,646
MATT: That's pretty gross. You marked off the 300
gold for the Revivify, right?

390
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:31,152
SAM: Oh, how many?

391
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:34,205
MATT: Revivify. It consumes a diamond worth 300
gold.

392
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,296
SAM: 300!

393
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:38,801
TRAVIS: Keyleth, did that hurt? Did it hurt?

394
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:42,607
MARISHA: It felt like blackness.

395
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:44,364
TRAVIS: Blackness?

396
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:51,430
MARISHA: It felt like a lot of adrenaline. And it
was super exciting and then next thing I knew,

397
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,141
everyone was super concerned about my well-being.

398
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:57,214
SAM: Are you addicted to death now?

399
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,882
MARISHA: No.

400
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:03,454
SAM: Have we healed her up a bit?

401
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:07,013
ASHLEY: I'm going to heal her up a little more.

402
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:10,236
SAM: I can do a healing draught for her.

403
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,317
ASHLEY: A what?

404
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:12,734
SAM: Healing draught.

405
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:21,364
MARISHA: Did you guys know: hitting water and
rocks from very high feels like hitting rocks!

406
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,365
TALIESIN: I literally have books on the subject.

407
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:28,325
MATT: Keyleth, as you turn around, you watch as
Tary is handing you this small glass vial of what

408
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:30,792
looks to be-- what color liquid is it?

409
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,369
SAM: It's colorless and odorless.

410
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,339
MATT: Okay, it's like a thicker water.

411
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,462
MARISHA: What's this?

412
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,549
SAM: Just drink it. It'll make you feel better.

413
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:47,087
MARISHA: I just dove off a cliff, so fuck it at
this point.

414
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,773
MATT: How much does she heal?

415
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:52,562
SAM: I rolled on my iPhone. 37. It's 8d8.

416
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:56,176
MATT: Keyleth, you heal 37 hit points.

417
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,239
MARISHA: Oh Jesus, 37?

418
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,596
LAURA: Do yours, too!

419
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:08,804
ASHLEY: Yeah! I'll do a Cure Wounds. I haven't
used any spells. Let's do 5th level.

420
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:13,412
TRAVIS: 5th level? Yeah!

421
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:19,164
MARISHA: I'm fine! Don't worry about me.

422
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,387
ASHLEY: Where are you at now?

423
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,680
MARISHA: I'm good! 104.

424
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,078
TALIESIN: Let's all go home, have a drink, and
discuss this over a drink.

425
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:31,763
MARISHA: Why? What? Why?

426
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:37,486
TALIESIN: Because I think this may speak to a
larger issue amongst us that maybe you are the

427
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,403
canary in the coal mine, here.

428
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:43,579
LAURA: I heard "We're gods!" before she hit.

429
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:46,681
TALIESIN: Was it "I'm a golden god?"

430
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:53,493
MARISHA: I said: I'm a golden god! But you know
what? I'm still alive; I wasn't entirely wrong.

431
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:56,080
TALIESIN: You're not still alive, you're alive
again!

432
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,790
LIAM: We should celebrate because we've broken in
the entire group.

433
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:07,942
TALIESIN: Yes, I think everybody has at least been
dead for a moment at this point.

434
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:09,245
MARISHA: Was I dead?

435
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,464
TALIESIN: Technically, yes.

436
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:13,115
TRAVIS: Look how much red is all over you!

437
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:18,495
MATT: Enough to the point where if you die again,
your resurrection DC has gone up.

438
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,739
Be aware of that.

439
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,276
TALIESIN: We could make another Kiki out of what
you're wearing right now.

440
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:27,030
LAURA: Have you <i>died</i> died? Tary <i>died</i> died.

441
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,117
SAM: Did I die? I think I died. In the water, I
think I died.

442
00:29:30,117 --> 00:29:31,304
MATT: He did.

443
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:33,206
TALIESIN: He died at the palace.

444
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,809
SAM: Think I died.

445
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,437
LAURA: Let's go home.

446
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:42,651
MARISHA: Why are you looking at me like that?!
Don't look at me like that!

447
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:45,728
LAURA: I'm not looking at you like anything. You
need a bath, is what you need.

448
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:47,143
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're covered in shit.

449
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,408
LAURA: It's really a lot right now.

450
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:53,310
ASHLEY: I say we go back. I would love to go back
and maybe have lots of drinks.

451
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,606
SAM: Let's go home.

452
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:58,225
LIAM: JB. Welcome to the family.

453
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:09,780
MATT: She's just like, eyes wide open. "Right."
She clutches her book a little closer to her chest as you

454
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:13,238
guys begin to make your way down the mountainside.
A different path than the other Trickfoots were

455
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:15,164
taking.

456
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:16,656
ASHLEY: Good call.

457
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:18,024
TALIESIN: Maybe we need a hobby?

458
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
TRAVIS: We'll never beat that death.

459
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,964
LAURA: That's like Keyleth-falling-in-lava bad.

460
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:24,305
TALIESIN: That was magical.

461
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:28,102
MATT: Marisha, how many fail compilation videos
have you seen where people jump off the cliff and

462
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:30,307
hit just at the bottom. That was what you did.

463
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,577
MARISHA: (laughing) It was totally a fail video!

464
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:37,361
TRAVIS: We were in a huge fight with a fake thing
that did no damage and you killed yourself in four

465
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,519
seconds.

466
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,068
LIAM: I got this!

467
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:49,125
TRAVIS: We're gods! (vomit sound) Unreal. Couldn't
write it.

468
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,663
MARISHA: I thought I could make it!

469
00:30:51,663 --> 00:31:01,337
MATT: I was like, one to 50, she hits the water.
51 to 100, she hits the rock. 94.

470
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,794
MARISHA: So I hit the rock.

471
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,546
MATT: Yeah, that's what happens.

472
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,214
TRAVIS: Either way, you were really screwed.

473
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:11,930
TALIESIN: To be fair, a goldfish, even at that
velocity-- although the velocity would have

474
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,259
lessened it more.

475
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:14,966
MARISHA: I should have bailed out as a bird.

476
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:19,525
LIAM: Make-believe has consequences.

477
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:22,688
TALIESIN: That's so true.

478
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:32,017
MATT: Over the course of the next day or little
over a day, you camp once in the Parchwood and

479
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,535
make your way back to Whitestone.

480
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:36,621
LIAM: Is 15 hours of that therapy?

481
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:38,486
MATT: For you, yeah.

482
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,164
MARISHA: I love how out of everything we've
seen, what I just did was apparently the most

483
00:31:42,226 --> 00:31:51,510
fucked up. Out of everything that's happened to
us, and now we need therapy? <i>Now</i> we need

484
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,655
therapy?

485
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:56,184
TALIESIN: We were living Tolkien and now we've
suddenly shifted into Game of Thrones. It got very

486
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:58,192
dark, very random, very quickly.

487
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:01,163
TRAVIS: Gods. Dead. Five Seconds. Hard to beat.

488
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:03,668
LIAM: We all stand for something. What do you fall
for?

489
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:15,839
MATT: You find your way back to Whitestone. You
check in. The guards are happy to see that you've

490
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,041
returned fine. They report to you that the
Trickfoot clan have not returned and have not been

491
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,585
seen near the city since your return. There are
few questions as to where they went.

492
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:29,316
TALIESIN: We're going to have their vehicle
searched for anything that doesn't belong to them,

493
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:33,085
and then made ready for them outside the city
bounds.

494
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:43,129
MATT: "Very well, sir." And they search through it
and mostly what's found in there are maybe 102

495
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,204
gold pieces.

496
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:47,719
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody with a criminal
background search the vehicle?

497
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:51,935
MATT: I mean, there are a number of people.

498
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:55,610
TALIESIN: I would like someone extremely sketchy
to search. Actually, Vax, would you search the

499
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,778
vehicle?

500
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:00,418
ASHLEY: And JB, if there is anything you need out
of there.

501
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:02,649
TRAVIS: You have chocolate on your face.

502
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,692
MATT: JB wipes it with a thumb.

503
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:11,965
TALIESIN: Including anything that you think would
be in more capable hands if they were

504
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:13,266
in your hands.

505
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:21,876
MATT: She shakes her head and "Wait." She climbs
up on the cart and she comes back and has a book.

506
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:29,364
Like a small tattered book and she puts it to her
side. "That's all. I don't care about the rest."

507
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:31,407
ASHLEY: Okay.

508
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,122
TALIESIN: Vax, quick check to see if there's
anything we care about.

509
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:38,211
LIAM: Oh, so good. Investigation, yeah? 18.

510
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:48,390
MATT: 18? You find the gold. You find a cache of
dried jerky meats. You find what looks to be some

511
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:55,932
leftover meat pie crust bits that have been there
for a few days. Starting to smell a little bit.

512
00:33:55,932 --> 00:34:04,728
And you get the sense that anything of importance
was on their persons. They weren't really storing

513
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,779
a lot of things in an open cart.

514
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:09,410
LIAM: This has been a bad couple of days.

515
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:16,779
TALIESIN: All right, just wanted to make sure
there wasn't anything (sighs) complicated. Leave

516
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:19,288
the gold, obviously, and the food.

517
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:20,679
MATT: All right.

518
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,906
SAM: Burn the wagon.

519
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,739
(laughter)

520
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,648
MATT: As you say that, Doty's like, "Tary."

521
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:30,378
SAM and ASHLEY: No!

522
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:33,531
SAM: You have to learn humor, Doty. Sarcasm.

523
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:38,519
MATT: All righty, so. What do you want to do?

524
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,686
SAM: Is it night?

525
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:48,464
MATT: By the time you've returned, it's probably
late afternoon. We'll say at this point because

526
00:34:48,464 --> 00:34:54,449
it's been about a little over a day and a half at
this point, so, yeah. Mid-afternoon.

527
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,413
LAURA: Shit.

528
00:34:57,413 --> 00:34:58,867
SAM: What should we do?

529
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,266
LAURA: I don't know.

530
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:04,469
SAM: We can go check on the Slayer's Cake?

531
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:08,035
LAURA: Oh yeah, we should probably do that. It's
been a couple of days.

532
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:09,088
SAM: Yeah.

533
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:11,315
LAURA: What did we do with it while we were gone?

534
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,768
SAM: Did we have someone running it? Do we have
someone?

535
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:15,187
MATT: (laughs) You do not.

536
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:18,128
TALIESIN: There's a sign that says "Closed for
adventuring."

537
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,686
SAM: Okay. We should hire someone.

538
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,648
LAURA: We really should.

539
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:22,610
SAM: Yeah.

540
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,142
LAURA: To run it if we're not around. (gasps) JB!

541
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,838
TRAVIS: Yeah, the thief. That's a good idea.

542
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,739
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a great idea!

543
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,431
LAURA: Well, do you like baking?

544
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,091
MATT: "I haven't really tried."

545
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:41,911
SAM: Have you any management experience?

546
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:46,158
MATT: "I took care of Uncle Ogden."

547
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:57,289
ASHLEY: I feel like she would be great at it.
Would you even be interested in maybe running a

548
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:02,828
bakery? Or is that something that just sounds like
the most dreadful thing in the world?

549
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:10,582
MATT: (nervous laugh) "I don't know." And she
pulls her hair. "I could try."

550
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:12,302
LAURA: How are you at math?

551
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,999
MATT: "I'm quite good at math, actually."

552
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:17,019
LAURA: Fabulous. Let's head there and see how you
do.

553
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:25,096
SAM: Yes. Let's see, but not make any promises,
because someone who's never run any--

554
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,972
LAURA: Right, Tary, you would know about hiring
people far more than--

555
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:29,922
SAM: We should have a proper interview.

556
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:30,970
LAURA: Right.

557
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,461
SAM: Check references.

558
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,569
LIAM: Well, you weren't a proper adventurer until
you were. Got to start somewhere.

559
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,575
SAM: True, but I had the advantage of being able
to buy my way in.

560
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:46,334
LAURA: That's true, but you were still pretty
shitty at it, when we first started.

561
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:48,415
TALIESIN: This is a form of nepotism. It's pretty
reasonable.

562
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,952
SAM: I'm open to it.

563
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:55,037
MATT: All right, is everyone going to the Slayer's
Cake?

564
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,177
LAURA: Yeah, because we can eat, too!

565
00:36:57,177 --> 00:37:00,395
MATT: Okay. Right, you guys all make your way to
the Slayer's Cake, as the afternoon is coming to a

566
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:08,674
close, dusk is starting to change the colors of
the sky. Clouds are beginning to move in, as the

567
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:14,977
night's evening air grows colder. As you come to
the outside, you see, it's dark and closed, and

568
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:21,344
you see what appears to be a figure sitting on the
ground against the wall, back to the wall, knees

569
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,701
huddled up.

570
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,421
SAM: Not JB?

571
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:26,462
MATT: No, JB is walking with you guys.

572
00:37:26,462 --> 00:37:29,174
SAM: In front of the bakery?

573
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:32,761
MATT: By the door, a little bit adjacent to where
the door is closed.

574
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:35,144
LAURA: We don't recognize them. Can we see their
face?

575
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:36,353
MATT: Make a perception check.

576
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:38,353
TALIESIN: Is this the same day, or has it been a
day now?

577
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:39,442
SAM: It's been a day.

578
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,437
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

579
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:47,230
LAURA: No! 30.

580
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:55,921
MATT: (laughs) Yeah! You see actually, a woman in
her late thirties or so, early forties,

581
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:02,188
platinum-blonde hair, that's pulled up in a ratty
bun. She's got strands hanging in the front of her

582
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:08,142
face, that go to about just past her chin. She has a
very simple dress, and a somewhat dirty apron, and

583
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:13,724
a small satchel on her side, and she's leaning
against the wall, her knees clutched to her, she's

584
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,538
looking forward, she hasn't noticed you guys yet;
you're a little ways up.

585
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:18,183
LAURA: And I don't recognize her.

586
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:19,786
MATT: No, you do not recognize her.

587
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:22,965
LAURA: Excuse me?

588
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:31,475
MATT: "Oh!" And she gets up, and stands up, and
(grunting) her back creaks a little bit, and she

589
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:36,578
stretches it, and dusts off the front of her
apron, you see little bit of dust (poof). "I'm

590
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:39,763
"terribly sorry, I wasn't sure when you were going
to be coming back."

591
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:43,457
LAURA: Oh, yeah, no. We were just off on an
adventure, but it'll take a little while before

592
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:44,824
the food is ready.

593
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:54,757
MATT: "Oh, that. (sighs) If you have a moment?
Fine sirs and madams, I'm sorry to bother you, you

594
00:38:54,757 --> 00:39:04,309
"see, my husband Dathen has not returned from sea
in about six months. And I'm not certain if he's

595
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:12,488
"coming back, and I'm without work and coffers he
left me have come empty this month, so could you

596
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:15,884
"perhaps use a hand here at the bakery?"

597
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,860
LAURA: Timing is quite--

598
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,379
MATT: It was ridiculous timing, yeah.

599
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:23,542
SAM: Madam, what's your name?

600
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,177
MATT: "Hilda."

601
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:30,228
SAM: And you would like a job at our bakery?

602
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,910
MATT: "If at all possible."

603
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,303
ASHLEY: Do you bake?

604
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:38,258
MATT: "I do!" She reaches into her satchel and you
see in the inside she has a bunch of these small

605
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:45,855
things wrapped in paper, and she opens one and
pulls it out and shows it to you. You see it's

606
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:51,352
this tiny little cream puff. It's perfectly made,
and has a little icing on the top. She's like,

607
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:56,363
"I used to just make these for old Dathen, but--"

608
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,507
SAM: May we try it?

609
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:04,893
MATT: "Of course!" She goes and pulls a handful
out and hands them amongst you and gives them

610
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:05,792
over.

611
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,645
ASHLEY: This is a beautiful cream puff.

612
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:09,521
LAURA: They're really hard to make.

613
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:14,264
SAM: Quick sidebar. This is better than anything
we've ever made.

614
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:15,802
LAURA: Did you already eat it?

615
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,513
SAM: Yes. It was really good.

616
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:21,257
LAURA: I'm going to wait a few minutes to see if
Tary looks like he just falls over or anything.

617
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:23,958
SAM: Wait. What? You think it's poisoned?

618
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,612
LAURA: No. I'm sure it's not.

619
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:27,683
SAM: I ate it. I ate the whole thing in one bite.

620
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,300
LAURA: It was really good?

621
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,160
SAM: Am I going to die?

622
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,311
TRAVIS: Give me all your stuff.

623
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:35,224
TALIESIN: How often do you just eat strangers'
cream puffs?

624
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,788
MATT: Her eyes go wide and like (mumbles).

625
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,708
SAM: Am I going to die? Did you just kill me?

626
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,567
MATT: "No!"

627
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:41,869
LAURA: No, she didn't.

628
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:48,749
ASHLEY: No.

629
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,409
(laughter)

630
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,789
MATT: It's actually very good. It's very, very
good.

631
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,463
TALIESIN: You're right, that is fun.

632
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:57,657
LAURA: It's really good.

633
00:40:57,657 --> 00:41:04,695
TALIESIN: Well, if it's all the same, I may have
another prospect for JB anyway.

634
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:10,762
LAURA: Well, come on inside, Hilda. Let's show you
around.

635
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,732
MATT: "Oh, all right."

636
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:13,933
ASHLEY: This is delicious.

637
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,388
SAM: It's really good.

638
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:17,448
ASHLEY: This is better than anything that we
make.

639
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:19,349
TALIESIN: It can't possibly be that good.

640
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:23,675
ASHLEY: Have you tried any of our baked goods,
yet?

641
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:34,293
MATT: "I haven't. I've seen it from a distance,
but I couldn't really afford to. I'd like to."

642
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:36,072
LAURA: Do you live here in Whitestone?

643
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:43,426
MATT: "I do. I live right behind--" And she points
up to the left. Like if the Sun Tree is in the

644
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:49,235
center and you head up straight on the eastern
side-- sorry, the western side of the square, the

645
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:53,595
path that leads up towards Whitestone Castle, she
points about two blocks up and on the left. And

646
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,634
there's a small hovel that's pushed between two
buildings there. And she goes,

647
00:41:56,634 --> 00:41:58,177
"That's where I stay."

648
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:01,210
ASHLEY: Can I insight check her? Because I don't
trust anybody.

649
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,523
LAURA: I don't trust anybody!

650
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,018
MATT: Go for it.

651
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:10,260
LAURA: It just makes us seem like assholes,
because we're like (grumbles). I want to go in a

652
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,260
little bit and ask around and see what people
think of her.

653
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,333
TRAVIS: What? A background check?

654
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,947
LAURA: A little background check.

655
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:19,106
ASHLEY: 27.

656
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,844
MATT: 27? Okay.

657
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:22,388
SAM: The whispers.

658
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:24,065
ASHLEY: I get a whisper?!

659
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:26,625
SAM: Have you never had a whisper?

660
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,515
ASHLEY: I don't think on the show I've had a
whisper.

661
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:32,416
SAM: Oh my god, everybody's firsts tonight.
Backblaze, ladies and gentlemen.

662
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:38,683
backblaze.com/criticalrole to get two weeks free
or something.

663
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:39,849
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

664
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,602
SAM: Yeah, two weeks. Oh, you want to do the
infomercial bit again?

665
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,802
LAURA: I really do, but you guys did such an
amazing job, though.

666
00:42:46,802 --> 00:42:56,551
TALIESIN: This is why we're the cool table.

667
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:02,406
ASHLEY: Well, I think that she should die. I'm
just kidding.

668
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:05,672
(laughter)

669
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,881
TALIESIN: Bake her into the pies.

670
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:11,979
ASHLEY: Do you have references?

671
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:14,583
MATT: "References?"

672
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,358
SAM: Have you worked anywhere else?

673
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,195
MATT: "No, I've mostly just been a housewife,
until recently."

674
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:27,421
SAM: Do you have anyone in the community who could
vouch for your character and trustworthiness?

675
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:34,344
MATT: "Perhaps. Norma Kell wakes up in the
morning. There's also Keeper Yennen."

676
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:37,400
SAM: Oh, Keeper Yennen! We know him! I think,
right? We know him?

677
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,957
LAURA: Yeah, we know Keeper Yennen.

678
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:41,855
MATT: "Yeah, aye. That's all I can think of at the
moment."

679
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:44,720
ASHLEY: How long has your husband been missing?

680
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,924
MATT: "About six months."

681
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,127
ASHLEY: About six months.

682
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,599
LAURA: What was he doing?

683
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,588
MATT: "He's a merchant sailor, coming in and out,
but he'd be back within the month usually. Some

684
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:57,569
"trips took longer, but six months seems
extraordinarily long for him."

685
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,442
SAM: Where did he go, again?

686
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:05,015
MATT: "Last I know, he does a circle around the
southern tip of Tal'Dorei and he usually hits Emon

687
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:15,394
"by ship. Occasionally heads over to the-- where is
it? The shama?"

688
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:16,923
TRAVIS: Shambala?

689
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:21,189
MATT: "Maybe something like that. I don't really
know for sure. It's a long ways away."

690
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:27,099
LAURA: Keyleth? I whisper to her. Keyleth, can you
scry on people we don't know?

691
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:36,236
MARISHA: If I have a piece of one of their
belongings. Yeah, that definitely helps, yeah.

692
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:42,802
LAURA: Hilda? Would you like us to check and see
if we can potentially find him?

693
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:44,811
MATT: "You can do that?"

694
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:50,239
LAURA: Well, if you have something of his that we
can look at, we might be able to help.

695
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,483
MATT: "Oh, aye! Just a moment." And she goes and
she goes rushing up the street real fast, this

696
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:58,174
renewed excitement in her face.

697
00:44:58,174 --> 00:44:59,684
LAURA: How do we feel about her?

698
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:02,845
SAM: Pike, if you were dead set on JB taking over
the business--

699
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:09,044
ASHLEY: No, I'm not. JB, don't feel pressured if
you don't want to do this. She's a fantastic

700
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:10,064
baker.

701
00:45:10,064 --> 00:45:14,453
LAURA: I mean, she's a really good baker. But
maybe JB can handle the books, and she can handle

702
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:15,464
the baking.

703
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:24,799
TALIESIN: Well, there is another option. Which is
that we have a giant pile of histories and library

704
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,545
and novels in our collected library, and we are
searching for information about the thing

705
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:39,507
underneath the castle, and we need readers. We
need lots and lots of people to read lots and lots

706
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:40,481
of books.

707
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:44,298
MATT: JB, you watch, like the excitement you just
saw on Hilda's face now hits JB's face.

708
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:46,891
"I'm a good reader. I can--"

709
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,417
LAURA: Well, okay.

710
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:50,830
ASHLEY: Yeah, that seems like a little more fun.

711
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:56,667
MATT: "Okay, yeah. I can also help with this if
you want. I'm more than happy to do both. I have a

712
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:57,956
"lot of free time now."

713
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,906
LAURA: That's true. You could run the bakery
during the day.

714
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:04,615
SAM: Why don't while we're gone you could help
Hilda. Hilda?

715
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:05,623
ASHLEY: Hilda.

716
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:12,045
SAM: Hilda. You could just help out, but maybe
leave her in charge? She seems like a--

717
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:17,799
TALIESIN: Or you could sit in the castle and read
diaries and ancient tomes of Whitestone.

718
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:21,760
MARISHA: Do I notice Grog looking uncomfortable?

719
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,659
TALIESIN: I definitely notice. I don't care.

720
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,016
LIAM: (cell phone ringing) Oh dear.

721
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:29,699
LAURA: Timer's done!

722
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:31,663
MATT: Grog, does she notice you feeling
uncomfortable?

723
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,735
TRAVIS: I don't know. Do you?

724
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:39,219
MARISHA: I don't know, do I?

725
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:40,845
MATT: Grog, are you uncomfortable?

726
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:43,131
TRAVIS: With this talk of reading? A little bit.

727
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:49,951
ASHLEY: (whispering) But Grog, you can read some
of those books a little bit.

728
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:52,752
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves,
all right?

729
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:59,373
ASHLEY: Well, okay. I think this is a great idea.

730
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,130
LAURA: I'm watching where Hilda is running.

731
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,570
MATT: Okay.

732
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,709
TRAVIS: I had a quick thought. If her husband's
dead, are we just going to tell her that right

733
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:08,891
now? Just you know, husband's dead. He's being
eaten by fish.

734
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,850
LAURA: No!

735
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,369
LIAM: No, you didn't get a read.

736
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:15,529
LAURA: Yeah, so Keyleth, if you like do read it
and you see it's super bad, don't--

737
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:18,566
LIAM: Oh, it's too hazy. I can't see him.

738
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:21,261
TRAVIS: That doesn't seem right at all

739
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:26,037
ASHLEY: No, but I think she should plan for her
life if he's not coming back.

740
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:27,813
TRAVIS: Yep. Pike and I are in agreement.

741
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:28,898
LAURA: But right now?

742
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:34,241
SAM: What if he's alive and in peril, do we tell
her that? We're going to lose our only employee.

743
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:37,176
LAURA: Well, then we go try to help him, maybe.

744
00:47:37,176 --> 00:47:42,076
SAM: Really? We have to go help someone? We just
met this person!

745
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,796
LAURA: That's what we do, Tary!

746
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:46,758
TALIESIN: We haven't done that in quite a while to
be fair.

747
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:49,320
TRAVIS: Plus, he was in somewhere like shambalam.

748
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,791
SAM: Do we know what she was talking about, by the
way?

749
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:57,990
MATT: You get the sense she probably was meaning
Shamel, which is the port where you guys had your

750
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,523
vacation. The Bay of Gifts.

751
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:01,299
SAM: We could go on vacation again!

752
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:11,479
MATT: About ten minutes or so pass and then Hilda
comes back, and you see she's clutching what looks

753
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:19,761
to be a small, gold chain. And she takes it and
goes, "This belonged to my husband. I don't know

754
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:21,025
"if this'll help."

755
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:22,749
LAURA: Sure. Keyleth?

756
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:26,702
SAM: Ignore the blood all over her body.

757
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:28,370
LAURA: She's fine.

758
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:32,136
MATT: You probably cleaned up over the past day or
so travel. Unless you didn't, in which case you

759
00:48:32,136 --> 00:48:34,967
are just a sticky Carrie.

760
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:36,720
MARISHA: No, I look awesome.

761
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,332
LIAM: It's dried in the hair, though, and caked
in.

762
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:43,195
MARISHA: I'm a little spacey, maybe? For a little
bit.

763
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:45,918
MATT: Yeah, understandably. You know, like you
do.

764
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:47,288
MARISHA: It's hard to say.

765
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:49,437
MATT: But anyway, she hands you the gold chain.

766
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:54,504
TALIESIN: Just checking, do you want to know no
matter what? Good or ill?

767
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:56,570
MATT: "Oh, I just want to know something."

768
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,887
TALIESIN: Fair enough.

769
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,684
MARISHA: What was his name?

770
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:01,579
SAM: Athen?

771
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,753
MATT: Yeah, it was Dathen. D-A-T-H-E-N. Dathen.

772
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:17,775
MARISHA: Can you tell me anything else about him
that would maybe help? What does he look like?

773
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:23,913
MATT: "He's got dusty brown hair, usually about
shoulder length. Well, he doesn't really grow

774
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:27,616
"facial hair but he's pretty scruffy, lower the
way. It's been many months, so I don't know.

775
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:36,707
"Medium build? Maybe about this high?" And she
gives a couple of inches off her own height. "He's

776
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,685
"got a right scar across his neck and his chest
right there he got when he was a kid."

777
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:47,589
MARISHA: All right. Should be enough. I'll do an
actual scrying spell.

778
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:58,181
MATT: All righty. So looking at the scrying spell
here. All right. You sit there and focus and

779
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:08,994
concentrate-- and darkness. Nothing. No link.
She's looking expectantly.

780
00:50:08,994 --> 00:50:10,668
MARISHA: What's that?

781
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,657
MATT: She's looking at you expectantly.

782
00:50:12,657 --> 00:50:36,097
MARISHA: Hilda? If he is on this plane of
existence, I don't know if it's a good sign. But

783
00:50:36,097 --> 00:50:45,510
it doesn't mean that he couldn't be lost somewhere
else. My spell only extends to this plane of

784
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:52,306
existence but there are many planes. I can try
again.

785
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:59,634
MATT: "No. That's all right. That's all I needed
to know. Thank you." At this point, as the sun is

786
00:50:59,634 --> 00:51:04,707
setting, starting to go into the evening, you can
see the light causing her to blear a little bit.

787
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:10,712
Here in the shade she's like, "Can we perhaps talk
in the morning?"

788
00:51:10,712 --> 00:51:13,181
LAURA: Of course. Take the evening.

789
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:17,531
MATT: "Where can I find you? Up?" As she points
over to the castle.

790
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:22,605
LAURA: Sure, yeah. One of us will be back here
tomorrow as well.

791
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:28,935
MATT: "All right. Thank you." And she quietly
walks back to the corner of the city

792
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:30,502
where she was from.

793
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:33,143
LAURA: Well, shit.

794
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:35,606
MARISHA: Well, that's not good.

795
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:38,503
LIAM: Give the woman a job. Keep her busy.

796
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,322
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

797
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:47,408
SAM: I'm just throwing this out there. If that was
a ploy to get a higher salary, I'm not biting.

798
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,724
LAURA: Tary.

799
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:53,354
SAM: I'm just saying, she could be very cunning.

800
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:54,956
TRAVIS: Yep, she might have killed her husband.

801
00:51:54,956 --> 00:51:57,359
MARISHA: I don't think so.

802
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,858
TRAVIS: Pretty sure she did it.

803
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:04,183
MARISHA: Do I have any further inkling?

804
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:09,850
MATT: No. Just did not find a source. Did not find
a source. Nothing. Nothing for the spell to grab

805
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,258
onto.

806
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:14,861
LAURA: Maybe you and I can take a stroll up by her
abode.

807
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:17,080
LIAM: All right.

808
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,252
LAURA: And just see.

809
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:19,401
LIAM: Sure.

810
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,892
LAURA: Make sure she's all right and--

811
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:25,894
LIAM: Right, best of intentions, yeah. I feel
you.

812
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:32,953
TRAVIS: We are background checking a fucking
bakery employee in our Dungeons and Dragons game!

813
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:36,649
LIAM: Matt has burned us too many times.

814
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:40,845
ASHLEY: The stupid box that we buried still haunts
me to this day.

815
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:43,050
LIAM: We just got swindled yesterday.

816
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,524
LAURA: Come on! We don't trust anyone

817
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:50,954
SAM: She didn't give us a social security, we
don't have an I-9. There's nothing.

818
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:56,666
LAURA: There's no way to know. She could just be
in here trying to get close to Vox Machina before

819
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,469
she takes us all down like Raishan.

820
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:00,627
SAM: She could be Raishan.

821
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:01,525
LAURA: She could!

822
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:06,048
TALIESIN: Speaking of deeply distrustful persons.
JB, do you want to come see the library? Does

823
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:07,375
anybody else want to come?

824
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,308
ASHLEY: I would love to come!

825
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:09,265
MATT: "Yes! Please!"

826
00:53:09,265 --> 00:53:10,341
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

827
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,424
MARISHA: Are you insinuating that JB isn't
trustful?

828
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:16,439
TALIESIN: Oh! Absolutely, in the best possible
way. I'm highly excited, and I think you're going

829
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,656
to do very well.

830
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:19,176
MATT: "Okay."

831
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:20,437
TALIESIN: See?

832
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:25,374
MARISHA: We like untrustworthy people. None of us
are trustworthy; it's good.

833
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:26,864
MATT: "I know, I've read."

834
00:53:26,864 --> 00:53:30,253
(laughter)

835
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:32,284
TALIESIN: Oh, that made me happy.

836
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:34,524
LAURA: We go by her hovel.

837
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:40,674
MATT: Okay. As you guys make your way back to the
castle you stop and go over there. You can see

838
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:46,360
it's one of three small homes that are jammed in
the alley areas between these larger buildings.

839
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:53,296
Almost like there's businesses on this one corner
and they have smaller people that are living more

840
00:53:53,296 --> 00:54:00,986
meager means. Each one of them appears to be
occupied. The one that she pointed to, you go to

841
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:05,424
it and it seems... there. There's like a very low
light through one of the windows.

842
00:54:05,424 --> 00:54:11,511
LIAM: I'm going to be real shitty and stealth up
and peek in and see what she's up to.

843
00:54:11,511 --> 00:54:13,054
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

844
00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:16,840
LAURA: She's changing. Crying, naked.

845
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,706
LIAM: We'll find out won't we. 33 for stealth.

846
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:24,668
MATT: All righty, and then make a perception
check.

847
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:26,529
LIAM: Yeah. Natural 20.

848
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:33,151
MATT: Okay. You glance up and over the side and
from the low candlelit interior, which you watch

849
00:54:33,212 --> 00:54:39,030
as there's a small candle that's lit on a little
wick there. And there's almost no furniture in

850
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:45,147
this house whatsoever. There's a stool and you
just see her sitting on the stool, motionless.

851
00:54:45,147 --> 00:54:53,051
LIAM: I want to insight check and just get as good
a read on her emotional state as I can, even

852
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:56,865
though she's got a thousand-yard stare. This is
insight?

853
00:54:56,865 --> 00:54:57,925
MATT: Yes.

854
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:59,694
LIAM: I'll use Luck. Better.

855
00:54:59,694 --> 00:55:00,753
TRAVIS: Luck?

856
00:55:00,753 --> 00:55:05,370
LIAM: Sure, why not? What am I saving it for? 18.

857
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:11,913
MATT: 18. I mean she's faced away from you. It's
hard to pick up-- away but to the side, and you

858
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:21,350
just see her just there. And you see her rummage
through her satchel on the side. Pull out a cream

859
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:22,937
puff and eat it.

860
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:25,274
LAURA: There's not even a bed in there? Just a
stool?

861
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:26,764
MATT: Just a stool.

862
00:55:26,764 --> 00:55:38,389
LIAM: Into the earring I say: We are terrible,
terrible assholes. She seems fine. She seems

863
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:44,904
worthy of a baking job. You know, work with her
for a day, but I'm not seeing anything hinky here.

864
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:49,124
Yeah? You need anything else?

865
00:55:49,124 --> 00:55:51,596
LAURA: No, I'm going to go talk to Keeper
Yennen.

866
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:54,416
LIAM: Because I'm staring at a woman crying into
her satchel.

867
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:56,092
SAM: Still going to talk to Yennen?

868
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:59,770
LAURA: It's our fucking business, you know?

869
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,087
SAM: Yeah, of course.

870
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:06,746
TALIESIN: This is more work than we put in hiring
our first castle guards.

871
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:11,171
LAURA: Yeah. Come on, at least we aren't trying to
like ambush her and attack her like we attacked

872
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,138
you, Tary.

873
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:16,142
LIAM: My significant other just mangled herself. I
need to keep busy. Let's go see Yennen. And so I

874
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:17,577
lead her off.

875
00:56:17,577 --> 00:56:26,530
MATT: Ha okay. You guys go ahead and make your way
towards Yennen's small temple in town. It's past

876
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:35,310
the evening sun, so you see Yennen's one younger
boy who helps him keep the establishment. He's in

877
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:40,131
the process of sweeping some of the fallen leaves
and various dust that has found its way into the

878
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:45,834
half-open dome place of worship. As you approach
he says, "Hi."

879
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:50,213
LAURA: Can I ask you a question, Keeper?

880
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:52,576
MATT: "Oh are you looking for Yennen?"

881
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,021
LAURA: Oh shit, yeah, sorry.

882
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,318
MATT: This is the younger boy.

883
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:59,519
LAURA: Keeper-in-training, is Keeper Yennen here?

884
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:08,963
MATT: "Let me get him." Puts the broom away.
Leaves for a second. The door opens to the side,

885
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:14,925
and you see Yennen come out, half awake. Looks
like he's in his evening attire, sleeping attire.

886
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:16,054
LAURA: Oh shit.

887
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,152
LIAM: Sorry.

888
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:18,911
LAURA: It's really that late? Oh, he's very old.

889
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:20,003
LIAM: Sorry.

890
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,294
LAURA: I'm so sorry to wake you.

891
00:57:22,294 --> 00:57:23,551
MATT: "That's all right."

892
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:25,053
LAURA: Oh, I feel like a dick.

893
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,509
MATT: "What can I do for you?"

894
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,806
LAURA: I just wanted to ask you about someone you
might know.

895
00:57:29,806 --> 00:57:31,456
MATT: "Yes?"

896
00:57:31,456 --> 00:57:32,623
LAURA: Hilda?

897
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:35,193
MATT: "Hilda? Yes, yes."

898
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:37,169
LAURA: What do you know about her?

899
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:48,095
MATT: "Not too much. She seems nice and keeps to
herself. She lives that way."

900
00:57:48,095 --> 00:57:51,153
LAURA: How long have you known her?

901
00:57:51,153 --> 00:57:55,224
MATT: "15 years?"

902
00:57:55,224 --> 00:57:57,091
LAURA: 15 years? She's been here 15 years?

903
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:58,815
MATT: "Her and her husband."

904
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:02,030
LAURA: Yeah. All right. What was he like? What is
he like?

905
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,939
MARISHA: Oh shit!

906
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:12,114
MATT: "A bit of a rambunctious young lad, until he
grew up. Don't see him very often.

907
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,214
"He comes in and out."

908
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:21,023
LAURA: He's a sailor. Well, that was helpful.
Anything remarkable? Any sort of

909
00:58:21,023 --> 00:58:23,519
untrustworthiness? Do you think she's fine? She's
cool?

910
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,921
MATT: "I assume. Is everything all right?"

911
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:35,319
LAURA: Everything's fine. You know, we're just
weird people right now. It's great.

912
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:39,194
LIAM: You don't know anything about Orcus, do
you?

913
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:42,186
MATT: "I know of."

914
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,790
LIAM: Didn't think so. We should leave.

915
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,937
LAURA: Thank you so much. Get some rest. I'm so
sorry to bother you.

916
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:49,007
LIAM: Come on.

917
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:51,296
MATT: "All right. Goodnight."

918
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:53,456
LAURA: We're making assholes of ourselves.

919
00:58:53,456 --> 00:58:57,067
LIAM: Surprise.

920
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:01,747
LAURA: Fine. We'll go meet up with everyone else.

921
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,035
SAM: What did you find out?

922
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:04,731
LAURA and LIAM: So much.

923
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:07,306
LAURA: She's a loner.

924
00:59:07,306 --> 00:59:08,635
ASHLEY: She's a loner?

925
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:14,116
LAURA: She's lived here for 15 years, but nobody
really knows anything.

926
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:18,259
SAM: And you say she sits in a room by herself
eating pastries?

927
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:23,194
LIAM: That's what she's doing tonight. I don't
think that's what she does every day.

928
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:25,146
LAURA: Who knows? She doesn't have a bed.

929
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,002
ASHLEY: Why is there no furniture in her
apartment?

930
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:29,975
SAM: Let's watch her work for a day. See how it
goes.

931
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:32,923
LIAM: Did I see more than one room, or was it a
single-room home?

932
00:59:32,923 --> 00:59:41,713
MATT: From what you can tell, it's a single room.
There's a pile of linens in a corner. There was a

933
00:59:41,713 --> 00:59:46,357
stool. It looked like there was a small area for
cooking.

934
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:51,075
LAURA: It's like Skyrim, y'all. There's a stool
and a cheese wheel.

935
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:54,081
TALIESIN: And a pot, and if you break it, there's
five coins.

936
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:58,563
MARISHA: And steal their plants from outside.

937
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:00,352
TALIESIN: And throw them at chickens.

938
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:02,097
ASHLEY: Mountain flowers.

939
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:03,892
MARISHA: Nightshade.

940
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:08,664
LAURA: Well, this was productive.

941
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:14,460
TALIESIN: At least we know, and there's no harm in
being careful. It's not like it's never happened

942
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,537
before.

943
01:00:15,537 --> 01:00:16,763
LAURA: Right.

944
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:22,822
TALIESIN: It's not the first time that we've been
trusting and been betrayed. Or the second or the

945
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:28,471
third. It's reasonable to be a bit cautious and we
were a bit cautious.

946
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:29,829
LIAM: Of cakes?

947
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:32,328
TALIESIN: Of cakes. To be fair, we are going to be
eating them.

948
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,657
TRAVIS: Are we reading right now?

949
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:40,150
TALIESIN: I assume we've gotten to the library. I
don't know.

950
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:46,307
MATT: They've traveled for a bit, you've had time
to hit the library and begin showing JB around.

951
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:52,127
ASHLEY: Are there children's books in here?

952
01:00:52,127 --> 01:01:01,020
TRAVIS: I found one! Look! Bus-ee-ness. Buseness.

953
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,962
MARISHA: He's learning.

954
01:01:02,962 --> 01:01:06,669
TRAVIS: Bus-ee-what?

955
01:01:06,669 --> 01:01:08,330
LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Business?

956
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:14,503
TRAVIS: Sound it out. Bus-eye-ness

957
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:17,597
MARISHA: Did you find a ledger? Is that what you
found?

958
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:19,523
TALIESIN: There are books I read as a child.

959
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:21,095
ASHLEY: (whispers) Where are they?

960
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:22,572
TALIESIN: Everywhere.

961
01:01:22,572 --> 01:01:24,782
ASHLEY: Can I see if I can find a kid's book?

962
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:26,448
LIAM: That's pronounced boysness.

963
01:01:26,448 --> 01:01:32,567
TRAVIS: Boysness. Can you use it in a sentence,
please?

964
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:36,588
LIAM: Grog got down to boysness and ended a fool's
life.

965
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:37,631
ASHLEY: 13.

966
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:44,416
MATT: 13? You find what amounts to a children's
book for Percival.

967
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:47,168
TALIESIN: Bless you.

968
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:50,144
SAM: High school biology.

969
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:52,308
TALIESIN: The Game of Logic by Lewis Carroll.

970
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:57,497
MATT: Yeah. Most of the books here are of
relatively advanced reading level. You gather it's

971
01:01:57,497 --> 01:02:00,052
a trait of the De Rolo family.

972
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:06,618
TALIESIN: Gives me the sense that this kid's going
to be fine.

973
01:02:06,618 --> 01:02:08,124
TRAVIS: Or-chid.

974
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,814
LAURA: Grog you can do the "ch?"

975
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,886
TRAVIS: Or-chide.

976
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:14,570
LAURA and ASHLEY: Orchid.

977
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,617
TRAVIS: No, it's not kid.

978
01:02:16,617 --> 01:02:21,906
ASHLEY: Sometimes when those letters are together,
it sounds like a K.

979
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:26,728
LAURA: What book are you reading that's about
boysness and orchids?

980
01:02:26,728 --> 01:02:30,103
TRAVIS: It's an orchid business.

981
01:02:30,103 --> 01:02:31,738
LAURA: Boysness.

982
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:34,799
TRAVIS: Boysness. Which is a location in Marquet.

983
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,902
MATT: All right. Are you guys doing anything else
for the evening?

984
01:02:40,902 --> 01:02:46,141
TALIESIN: Just showing her what we would like to
pay her to do. Which is: all of these books,

985
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:55,138
there's this huge section that are mostly
histories, diaries, folk tales, or otherwise. Take

986
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:59,615
one of these slips of paper when you read a book.
You write your name on it and you leave it in the

987
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:06,237
book. Then anytime you find anything peculiar-- a
ghost story or a strange occurrence in any of

988
01:03:06,237 --> 01:03:11,306
these books. Anything at all that might be
fanciful or unexplained, you mark with a piece of

989
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:16,217
gold thread and put it back on the shelf and then one
of the other librarians will come and find that

990
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:22,181
book and bring it down for further study. You just
have to find the most interesting of these books

991
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:23,906
and make sure that they're well marked.

992
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:25,329
MATT: "I can do that."

993
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:26,703
TALIESIN: I had a funny feeling.

994
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:28,223
MARISHA: What makes them interesting?

995
01:03:28,223 --> 01:03:33,724
TALIESIN: What makes a book interesting? I
genuinely don't know how to answer that.

996
01:03:33,724 --> 01:03:35,945
LAURA: Sexy pictures.

997
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,138
TALIESIN: There's not a lot of that in this
library.

998
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:45,049
MARISHA: Are you giving someone parameters by
which they don't really have rules to follow?

999
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:48,566
TALIESIN: Well that's the trouble with looking for
something that if you don't know what it is.

1000
01:03:48,566 --> 01:03:50,293
MARISHA: Right.

1001
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:56,358
TALIESIN: But if in one of these diaries someone
remarks upon a strange murder or a ghost story, or

1002
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:03,412
honestly, anything interesting that's a bit
peculiar, you just mark it and then we take a look.

1003
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:07,175
That way we thin out the amount that 
we have to read down to a manageable amount.

1004
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,658
MARISHA: So, it takes a peculiar person to know
what's peculiar?

1005
01:04:10,658 --> 01:04:12,592
TALIESIN: That does help, yes.

1006
01:04:12,592 --> 01:04:16,937
MATT: "Okay, I can do that."

1007
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,186
MARISHA: Yeah.

1008
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:27,922
ASHLEY: Is there a place-- just ask Percy
privately. She can stay with me.

1009
01:04:27,922 --> 01:04:29,185
TALIESIN: I assumed.

1010
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:38,449
ASHLEY: Do I have an extra bedroom? Or how does
this work?

1011
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:40,359
TALIESIN: Where is Pike?

1012
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:41,989
LAURA: Is she staying in the castle, right?

1013
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:46,696
MATT: She has a room in the castle, one that used
to be one of the guest rooms when you had people

1014
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:47,890
you were entertaining.

1015
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:52,127
ASHLEY: Maybe there's a Murphy bed or something
extra in the room.

1016
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:55,067
MATT: It's easy enough to put a second bed in
there. The doorways are wide.

1017
01:04:55,067 --> 01:04:57,648
TALIESIN: If she would like her own room, that can
absolutely be arranged.

1018
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:02,540
ASHLEY: JB? Do you-- I don't know how--

1019
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,538
MATT: She's in the process of looking and she's
like writing down, taking notes of the different

1020
01:05:06,538 --> 01:05:08,828
sections, talking to herself. She's not even
looking at you.

1021
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:19,795
ASHLEY: You are more than welcome to stay with me.
I do have night terrors, so sometimes not fun, but

1022
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:23,872
you can stay with me or you could have your own
room.

1023
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:25,849
MATT: "No, that's fine."

1024
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:32,356
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, which one?

1025
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:37,894
MATT: "Staying with you. Is there something I
should do if you're having a night terror?"

1026
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:40,609
ASHLEY: Just wait it out.

1027
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:41,959
MATT: "Okay, don't wake you up?"

1028
01:05:41,959 --> 01:05:43,125
ASHLEY: Nah.

1029
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,144
MATT: "Okay."

1030
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:51,228
ASHLEY: Okay. This will be fun. It'll be like
sleepovers. Maybe we can make a fort!

1031
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:53,886
MATT: "We can make forts? Out of what?"

1032
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:57,692
ASHLEY: Just all the blankets. Tapestries.

1033
01:05:57,692 --> 01:06:06,546
MATT: You watch all of a sudden her eyes-- in this
library, there are a number of old tapestries and

1034
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:10,857
you know carpet elements around. You watch as she
scans the entire room for materials and goes,

1035
01:06:10,857 --> 01:06:12,563
"Oh, we can do this."

1036
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:16,786
ASHLEY: I have a feeling you are a great fort
builder.

1037
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:20,769
MATT: "I haven't tried, but I have some
theories."

1038
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:25,551
TALIESIN: I pull two engineering books off the
shelf and hide them.

1039
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:31,392
MATT: Perfect. All right.

1040
01:06:31,392 --> 01:06:39,398
TALIESIN: I feel like this has been taken care of.
You know the system.

1041
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:41,068
ASHLEY: Percy, thank you.

1042
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,945
TALIESIN: Would you like an extra bed sent?

1043
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,132
ASHLEY: Yes, please.

1044
01:06:44,132 --> 01:06:45,266
TALIESIN: That can be arranged.

1045
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:48,895
MATT: Okay, so you have a second bed installed in
Pike's room. You guys have your dinner for the

1046
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:50,316
evening, anything else?

1047
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:53,663
TALIESIN: Take another look at the thing
downstairs.

1048
01:06:53,663 --> 01:06:56,159
LAURA: Well, I go with you.

1049
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:05,882
MATT: Okay. You guys head down into the tunnels,
make your way to the ziggurat beneath Whitestone

1050
01:07:05,882 --> 01:07:11,372
and as you enter the inside of the chamber, you
can see there's a few torches set up in there.

1051
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:17,171
There is that secondary platform where you guys
met a year ago, where you had the small council

1052
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:23,470
with Raishan as well to decide what was to become
of the Chroma Conclave. Up there, you can see

1053
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:28,314
there's a whole research bench set up with a
couple of desks and pretty much all the

1054
01:07:28,314 --> 01:07:31,722
information that's been gathered, and various
things that have been studied over the past year

1055
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:37,982
or so about it. What has been figured out, and
there were theories thrown around before of it

1056
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:48,702
being a siphon. An artifact that is related to
something that was referred to as a Sphere of

1057
01:07:48,702 --> 01:07:55,660
Annihilation. Not directly, but an offshoot of
that type of enchantment. As opposed to completely

1058
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:01,867
destroying anything it comes into contact with,
it's attuned in the siphoning of things from one

1059
01:08:01,867 --> 01:08:12,513
location to another. It's a translocation type of
magic. There have been a number of things that

1060
01:08:12,513 --> 01:08:22,188
have been placed within this sphere and did not
return, including one volunteer, a member of the

1061
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:29,219
Pale Guard, who during the year's research
volunteered to step through and was not heard from

1062
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:38,456
again. And that stopped any future volunteers from
rising to the occasion. But since the research

1063
01:08:38,456 --> 01:08:46,381
that's been taken up about what the siphon's
existence, during the Age of Arcanum they were one,

1064
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:54,105
used as a defensive measure against powerful
mages, but that was more of a secondary use during

1065
01:08:54,105 --> 01:08:59,009
the actual war that ended the Age of Arcanum.
Their initial creation was supposed to be able to

1066
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:04,609
harness and shift ley line energy. The idea was
wherever there was a large source of magical

1067
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:09,486
energy but it was inconvenient, its placement, its
natural placement in the world, they could use

1068
01:09:09,486 --> 01:09:13,847
these siphons to basically triangulate and shift
where that energy would go.

1069
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:20,343
TALIESIN: It's been here an awful long time now. We
don't even know if they created it or if they

1070
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:21,519
found it.

1071
01:09:21,519 --> 01:09:28,616
MATT: You don't know, like the information about
them is I would say almost mythological, in the

1072
01:09:28,616 --> 01:09:32,156
sense that there are stories that talk about them
and a lot of the information was destroyed during

1073
01:09:32,156 --> 01:09:34,823
the Divergence regarding to the older Age of
Arcanum magics.

1074
01:09:34,823 --> 01:09:37,626
TALIESIN: The castle's always had strange
stories.

1075
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:41,679
MATT: Yeah, and this is information that was
brought together by Eskil Ryndarien when he was

1076
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:48,272
down here researching with Allura even during the
Conclave. A lot of people have gone off because

1077
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:53,471
the research hit a wall, it was like, "Well, we
find out pretty much everything about this, we just

1078
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:58,076
"don't know where the siphon is going, and anything
we've tried to put through doesn't come back." So

1079
01:09:58,255 --> 01:10:04,075
the theory is to find the other half of the siphon
because it's a connecting point. There's two sides

1080
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:10,297
to it, so if it this is correct, then the theory
is there would be another side to it. Or if not it

1081
01:10:10,297 --> 01:10:15,125
might just be a Sphere of Annihilation or
something adjacent to it and is essentially a null

1082
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,644
and void circumstance. Those are where the
theories stand.

1083
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:18,922
LAURA: Percy?

1084
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:20,062
TALIESIN: Yes?

1085
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:25,784
LAURA: The crystal that Lillith gave you. Does
that work across planes?

1086
01:10:25,784 --> 01:10:30,779
MATT: You have to be on the same plane of
existence

1087
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:31,730
LAURA: Okay.

1088
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:39,946
TALIESIN: I've thought about it. I definitely
think there's something on the other side of this,

1089
01:10:39,946 --> 01:11:01,534
and this thing is how I think I know that our work is not
yet done. I dream about it sometimes. Do you ever

1090
01:11:01,534 --> 01:11:04,166
come down and just look at it?

1091
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:08,906
LAURA: To be honest, it intimidates me quite a
bit.

1092
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:13,312
TALIESIN: What do you see?

1093
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:21,146
LAURA: What do I see?

1094
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:30,008
Can I use my oracle arrow
and shoot it into it?

1095
01:11:30,008 --> 01:11:33,956
MATT: You can certainly give it a try. You can
certainly try.

1096
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,745
SAM: (whispers) What's an oracle arrow?

1097
01:11:35,745 --> 01:11:37,008
TRAVIS: She can shoot her arrow--

1098
01:11:37,008 --> 01:11:41,407
LAURA: And see through the arrow. Okay. What do I
do?

1099
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:44,022
MATT: All right, well, go ahead and roll an
attack.

1100
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:45,861
LAURA: Okay.

1101
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:47,505
TALIESIN: Let's back up a bit of a distance.

1102
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:53,335
LAURA: Yeah. We'll back up as far as we can so I
can still hit the thing. It is a magical arrow,

1103
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:58,285
and this thing cuts out all the magic but maybe
once it goes through the siphon, maybe I'll still

1104
01:11:58,285 --> 01:11:59,406
be able to use it?

1105
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:04,032
TALIESIN: Well, we can actually get to the edge
where magic starts again and then it might

1106
01:12:04,097 --> 01:12:06,761
reconnect once it goes through.

1107
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:10,324
LAURA: Yeah, we'll stand outside of the door.

1108
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:12,241
SAM: So you only have one of these?

1109
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,825
LAURA: I have two per short rest.

1110
01:12:13,825 --> 01:12:15,521
SAM: Oh, you're fine.

1111
01:12:15,521 --> 01:12:24,994
MATT: As part of your newly-exalted bow. Okay,
this is going to be-- hold on to that roll

1112
01:12:24,994 --> 01:12:29,428
whatever that was. So to get out of the radius,
because it basically cuts right into the hallway

1113
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:35,462
that leads inside of it, you have to back out of
the chamber into the hallway a few feet and

1114
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:39,685
basically get on the ground and aim upwards
towards, and you're going to have to arc over the

1115
01:12:39,685 --> 01:12:43,370
top of the ziggurat to get in. So this is a shot
with a disadvantage.

1116
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,528
LIAM: Sharpshooter?

1117
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:45,967
LAURA: With disadvantage. I am sharpshooter.

1118
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:49,544
LIAM: Wouldn't that nullify that? Three-quarter
cover means nothing. It's just full cover.

1119
01:12:49,544 --> 01:12:54,868
MATT: Well, what I was going to say it would have
a really high AC with disadvantage. I'm not going

1120
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:58,122
to consider it with having a super high AC. It's
still a very hard shot.

1121
01:12:58,122 --> 01:12:59,450
LAURA: So disadvantage?

1122
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:03,462
MATT: So disadvantage on the shot.

1123
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,850
LAURA: 30.

1124
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,314
SAM: Whoa!

1125
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,297
LIAM: Yeah, both were high teens.

1126
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,446
ASHLEY: It's Critical Role's dice.

1127
01:13:10,446 --> 01:13:12,173
LAURA: It is the Critical Role dice.

1128
01:13:12,173 --> 01:13:18,410
TALIESIN: What?! I'm so proud of you!

1129
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:21,710
SAM: It shouldn't work.

1130
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,787
TALIESIN: It shouldn't work, but it did!

1131
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:26,167
ASHLEY: T-shirts!

1132
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:31,742
SAM: Weirdly, the arrow hits and kills Keyleth.

1133
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:39,799
MARISHA: (death rattle) Not like this.

1134
01:13:39,799 --> 01:13:46,983
SAM: Don't do that! This is a long whisper.

1135
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:50,590
LIAM: He's telling her real stuff, man.

1136
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:52,632
SAM: Oh man, this is not what we normally get.

1137
01:13:52,632 --> 01:13:55,137
TALIESIN: No, this is a whole chunk of stuff.

1138
01:13:55,174 --> 01:13:56,325
ASHLEY: Backblaze!

1139
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:59,725
SAM: By the way, just a little insight, what we
normally get on the whispers is,

1140
01:13:59,725 --> 01:14:05,314
"From what you can tell, it seems 
totally normal." And then that's about it.

1141
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:08,067
MARISHA: That's actually really accurate.

1142
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:10,876
TALIESIN: Briefly, back in the old days, they were
experimenting with texting us whispers.

1143
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:14,052
SAM: As far as you can tell he thinks he's telling
the truth.

1144
01:14:14,052 --> 01:14:16,395
ASHLEY: I want to know.

1145
01:14:16,395 --> 01:14:19,535
TALIESIN: I'm glad we stopped trying to text each
other whispers.

1146
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:22,284
SAM: Whoa, her mind is blown.

1147
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:25,680
LAURA: Can I have a pencil! I got to write this
shit down. Pencil!

1148
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:31,767
TALIESIN: Her eyes go white and it's just
(scribbling). Yay.

1149
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,883
ASHLEY: It was so much!

1150
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:37,094
SAM: She's drawing a weird alien creature.

1151
01:14:37,094 --> 01:14:39,021
LAURA: I got to write it down or else I'll
forget!

1152
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,988
SAM: Big head, big eyes, small body.

1153
01:14:40,988 --> 01:14:48,132
TALIESIN: Three syllables. We're being invaded by
dingbats.

1154
01:14:48,132 --> 01:14:50,948
MARISHA: What does a smiley emoji mean? I don't
understand.

1155
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:52,728
SAM: She speaks Arrival language now.

1156
01:14:52,728 --> 01:14:57,236
LAURA: Oh my god. Percy! I saw something!

1157
01:14:57,236 --> 01:15:00,477
TALIESIN: You didn't. Really?

1158
01:15:00,477 --> 01:15:08,524
LAURA: I did! I think it was another plane.

1159
01:15:08,524 --> 01:15:11,573
LIAM: Vex dies.

1160
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:17,810
TALIESIN: We have to figure out how to-- is there
a way to make sure we get every detail? I'm

1161
01:15:17,874 --> 01:15:25,626
finding pen and paper; we're writing everything
you can remember down. Is there a way to recall

1162
01:15:25,626 --> 01:15:29,166
someone's memory in perfect detail, is there any
sort of magic that can actually--

1163
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:31,047
MATT: There are, yeah.

1164
01:15:31,047 --> 01:15:33,008
TALIESIN: Okay. This shit's happening!

1165
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:42,056
LAURA: Otherwise, I could just tell you what I
sort of saw, but I heard a lot of "Backblaze!" in

1166
01:15:42,056 --> 01:15:43,704
the background.

1167
01:15:43,704 --> 01:15:45,688
TALIESIN: It was the Backblaze dimension?

1168
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:49,520
MATT: They're not siphons. They're storage units!

1169
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,458
MARISHA: You saw the cloud? What did it look
like?

1170
01:15:55,458 --> 01:16:05,018
MATT: Just Pelor backing up his hard drive. All
right. It's pretty vivid for you, and so as you

1171
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:12,608
recount. What she saw is the arrow, it was
darkness when she fired it, as it passed through

1172
01:16:12,608 --> 01:16:18,959
the sphere of anti-magic, there was nothing. And
then suddenly, imagery blinked through the arrow.

1173
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:24,591
From the perspective of it as it coasted away, she
looked behind and could see the twin to this orb.

1174
01:16:24,591 --> 01:16:31,236
Apparently not under the same anti-magic shell on
the other side. Whereas this side steals magic,

1175
01:16:31,236 --> 01:16:38,973
the other side emits it. As the arrow landed and
clattered to the stonework maybe 20 feet below the

1176
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:45,069
orb, looking around, she saw a landscape of
blackened, broken stone and ground. Distant

1177
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:52,886
mountainscapes of jagged crags, like teeth across
the horizon. The sky itself was black and

1178
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:59,842
shadowed, like it was perpetually amidst a distant
forest fire, and where you can see the grey in the

1179
01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:07,568
sky you can see roiling thunder clouds with
flashes of lightning. And roughly a mile or so

1180
01:17:07,568 --> 01:17:14,329
from what you could tell from where this was you
could see what appeared to be a large obsidian

1181
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:19,912
tower of twisted black stone that went up for what
appeared to be a dozen or more stories.

1182
01:17:19,912 --> 01:17:23,302
LAURA: Don't we know something about obsidian--

1183
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:26,273
MARISHA: The same tower we saw in the Nine Hells?

1184
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:27,315
LAURA: No.

1185
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:28,642
MATT: No, different tower.

1186
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:31,544
LAURA: This is way bigger.

1187
01:17:31,544 --> 01:17:37,200
MATT: No, the tower in the Nine Hells was the
biggest thing you've ever seen tower-wise. This is

1188
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,480
big, but imagine a 12-story obsidian tower that's
pretty thin and tall.

1189
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:47,807
LAURA: Okay. I'm glad I remembered that correctly
because I was remembering it as a citadel and it's

1190
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:49,422
just a tower.

1191
01:17:49,422 --> 01:17:57,649
TALIESIN: This is spectacular! This is great! We
have to let everybody know! Oh god, we have to let

1192
01:17:57,649 --> 01:18:02,427
everybody know. And I grab her and we bolt out.

1193
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,502
LAURA: Does it sound like anything you know?

1194
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:11,000
TALIESIN: No? Yes? Maybe? I don't know! I'm not
sure. This is a breakthrough. We have a

1195
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,224
breakthrough! We have a breakthrough! I am running
to Cassandra, who I'm sure is asleep.

1196
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:20,789
MATT: Yeah, most everyone's-- you guys have all
gone to bed at this point I imagine; you guys were

1197
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:22,277
down there pretty late.

1198
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:27,984
LIAM: Well first I drag Keyleth off to the cozy
little bathtubs that they have here in the castle

1199
01:18:27,984 --> 01:18:34,841
and took the opportunity-- they're quite small,
actually. And washed all of the caked-in, the last

1200
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:36,456
of the caked-in blood and everything.

1201
01:18:36,456 --> 01:18:38,933
TRAVIS: Because they say it, it's true.

1202
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:42,083
TALIESIN: We have a full Roman sauna underneath,
but that's fine, whatever you need.

1203
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:47,286
ASHLEY: I took JB back and we built a fort in the
room.

1204
01:18:47,286 --> 01:18:49,223
MATT: And you've gone to bed?

1205
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:51,138
SAM: Oh yeah, I'm asleep.

1206
01:18:51,138 --> 01:18:53,758
TRAVIS: I look for a book on werewolves.

1207
01:18:53,758 --> 01:18:56,163
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

1208
01:18:56,163 --> 01:19:00,171
TALIESIN: Natural 20, Natural 20!

1209
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:03,390
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

1210
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:12,540
(cheering)

1211
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,852
TALIESIN: It's that night.

1212
01:19:13,852 --> 01:19:16,195
MATT: Against all odds.

1213
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:20,033
TALIESIN: The trick is it requires human
sacrifice.

1214
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:23,709
MARISHA: It is a full moon tonight, isn't it? Or
was it last night? When was the full moon?

1215
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:33,404
MATT: You surprise yourself, Grog, going
"w-w-werewolves." There's a book that talks about the

1216
01:19:33,404 --> 01:19:38,008
disease of lycanthropy and were-creatures and
entities, and it's there before you and you find

1217
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:41,484
it's like your own little birthday party.

1218
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:42,683
TRAVIS: I take it with me.

1219
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:43,989
MATT: Okay.

1220
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:47,588
TALIESIN: I'm calling a meeting of the council.
I'm sending out the word. I'm telling everyone

1221
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:48,743
that we have new information.

1222
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:49,600
SAM: At night?!

1223
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,213
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm starting it now so that people
who are not here can figure out their way here.

1224
01:19:52,213 --> 01:19:54,059
MARISHA: Are you getting it over our earpieces?

1225
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:59,591
TALIESIN: Not them. To the studying council,
anybody who's been studying the object. I'm letting

1226
01:20:00,037 --> 01:20:04,724
everybody know as quickly as possible. There's new
information.

1227
01:20:04,724 --> 01:20:14,959
MATT: All right, so that being the case, you let
Cassandra know. Cassandra goes, "My god, all right.

1228
01:20:14,959 --> 01:20:22,361
"Well, let me-- I think I-- hold on." She goes and
rushes back to her room and she comes back with a

1229
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:28,660
small, looks like a river stone, but has what
looks to be a small rune carved into it. She takes

1230
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:33,748
it and holds it and goes "Sorry to bother you, my
dear, but apparently Percival has a breakthrough

1231
01:20:33,748 --> 01:20:40,532
"in regards to the ziggurat and the orb. As soon as
you can, please." Then takes it and puts it into a

1232
01:20:40,532 --> 01:20:47,560
small pouch. "Hopefully, Allura received that and
should be arriving soon. As to Eskil, I don't know

1233
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,992
"how to get in touch with him; he's probably well
into his sleep and he gets cranky."

1234
01:20:50,992 --> 01:20:56,693
TALIESIN: He'll find out in the morning. This is
good. We'll start looking with the new data as

1235
01:20:56,693 --> 01:21:01,724
soon as everyone gets here. This is excellent.
Excellent! Good night. Go to sleep. Why are you

1236
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:07,896
awake? No! And I'm out the door. I run to Vex's
house. We're done.

1237
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:10,952
MATT: All right, so you guys just go to bed?

1238
01:21:10,952 --> 01:21:11,932
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1239
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:23,816
LAURA: I guess so. Yeah. But, wait. Actually,
Percy? Off-subject, but, when I saw Keyleth, I

1240
01:21:23,816 --> 01:21:30,974
mean, she was destroyed right? I mean, fucking
destroyed. Arms everywhere, limbs broken, just

1241
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:31,907
terrible.

1242
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:33,032
TALIESIN: Yes.

1243
01:21:33,032 --> 01:21:45,533
LAURA: We put her back together like we always do,
but I can't get Scanlan out of my mind. It's so

1244
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:55,924
random, I know, but what if that happened to him
and we're not with him? No one's there to cast

1245
01:21:55,924 --> 01:21:57,211
Revivify.

1246
01:21:57,211 --> 01:22:08,657
TALIESIN: If he wanted to be found, he'd be found.
His daughter's there, and maybe he is possibly

1247
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:12,643
smart enough to explain to her how that stone
works.

1248
01:22:12,643 --> 01:22:18,532
LAURA: Have you scryed on him again?

1249
01:22:18,532 --> 01:22:36,879
TALIESIN: Not successfully. Not since I briefly
found him and then I lost him. But I always have

1250
01:22:36,879 --> 01:22:38,645
people looking.

1251
01:22:38,645 --> 01:22:46,721
LAURA: All right. I don't know why he's on my
mind. Obviously, we have much bigger things.

1252
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:53,423
TALIESIN: I think maybe bigger things will help.
It's been too quiet.

1253
01:22:53,423 --> 01:22:55,918
LAURA: Not good at quiet

1254
01:22:55,918 --> 01:23:00,115
TALIESIN: No. I mean, I've enjoyed it. This has
been great, everything, everything has been great.

1255
01:23:00,115 --> 01:23:15,447
This is wonderful, but I will admit I miss-- I
don't know what I miss. I miss it, though. I feel

1256
01:23:15,447 --> 01:23:20,311
like I'm tempting fate and I'm going to regret
everything I say right now, one day.

1257
01:23:20,311 --> 01:23:24,499
LAURA: I think we are, who knows what this will
lead to.

1258
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,043
TALIESIN: Maybe we can shut it down for good.

1259
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:28,467
LAURA: Yes.

1260
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:36,795
TALIESIN: Maybe we're going to go find a small
black tower somewhere filled with death and

1261
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:37,923
despair.

1262
01:23:37,923 --> 01:23:40,865
LAURA: I don't know if I'm going to be able to
sleep tonight!

1263
01:23:40,865 --> 01:23:42,205
TALIESIN: No.

1264
01:23:42,205 --> 01:23:53,945
MATT: So as you find your rest for the evening,
the morning comes. Bright, warm. The clouds that

1265
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:58,729
came in for the evening, it's still a cloudy sky
and as you wake up the mist that usually takes up

1266
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:03,295
the bottom of the valley and the forest floor is
beginning to burn off as the sun begins to peek

1267
01:24:03,295 --> 01:24:12,432
through the clouds and show little bursts of blue
above. You guys head back to the castle, where all

1268
01:24:12,432 --> 01:24:20,365
of you are, everyone but Keyleth. We'll say
Keyleth's still sleeping and Taryon's still

1269
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:21,485
sleeping.

1270
01:24:21,485 --> 01:24:23,356
TALIESIN: Keyleth had a bit of day.

1271
01:24:23,356 --> 01:24:32,323
MATT: However, Allura is there waiting. She's
there and as you approach she goes,

1272
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:35,214
"Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise?"

1273
01:24:35,214 --> 01:24:40,894
She rushes up and gives Vex a big hug.
She comes and takes your hand as well, Percival,

1274
01:24:40,894 --> 01:24:46,757
and pulls you in. "So, Cassandra told me that
there was some sort of a--"

1275
01:24:46,796 --> 01:24:55,239
TALIESIN: Well, Vex had a brilliant idea. Recently,
you came to a very interesting power.

1276
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:59,629
LAURA: Yes, from the exalted weapon that I got
from Saundor.

1277
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:02,414
MATT: "Oh, your Vestige. Yes."

1278
01:25:02,414 --> 01:25:07,306
LAURA: Yes, and it has the ability to shoot arrows
that see.

1279
01:25:07,306 --> 01:25:09,691
MATT: "I recall you telling me this, yes."

1280
01:25:09,691 --> 01:25:14,908
LAURA: Right, so I shot it into the orb. And I saw
through it.

1281
01:25:14,908 --> 01:25:19,731
MATT: "Oh." At which point you watch her whole
demeanor change and she leans in, "What did you see?"

1282
01:25:19,731 --> 01:25:27,417
LAURA: Fucking everything. A sky and an orb and a tower.
An obsidian tower like twelve stories tall.

1283
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:28,932
MATT: Keyleth comes down for breakfast.

1284
01:25:28,992 --> 01:25:32,413
LAURA: Hey, Kiki. Good morning.

1285
01:25:32,487 --> 01:25:35,524
MARISHA: Hi, sorry. I had weird dreams.

1286
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:37,415
TRAVIS: That you died?

1287
01:25:37,415 --> 01:25:40,100
LIAM: No, that really happened. That actually
happened yesterday.

1288
01:25:40,147 --> 01:25:44,216
LAURA: Destroyed landscape, whole other plane.
Very dark, very scary.

1289
01:25:44,216 --> 01:25:45,977
MATT: "Another plane?"

1290
01:25:45,977 --> 01:25:47,572
LAURA: I think. I assume.

1291
01:25:47,572 --> 01:25:53,092
TALIESIN: This is everything as she described it.
This is everything I could write down.

1292
01:25:53,092 --> 01:26:06,160
MATT: As you describe down the location she goes,
"This is certainly not a place that I know of on

1293
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,436
"this plane."

1294
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:13,543
MARISHA: My dreams are on this plane?

1295
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:17,459
LAURA: Keyleth! We had a breakthrough.

1296
01:26:17,459 --> 01:26:23,610
MATT: "This sounds like a location that resides
somewhere in the Shadowfell."

1297
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,856
LAURA: The Shadowfell?

1298
01:26:25,856 --> 01:26:28,985
TRAVIS: Wait, Shadowfell?

1299
01:26:28,985 --> 01:26:34,712
MATT: "The Shadowfell, yes. You know how you went
to the Feywild, which is more of an overgrown

1300
01:26:34,712 --> 01:26:48,196
"fey-based nature parallel to this world, yes? The
Shadowfell is the dark shadow reflection of this

1301
01:26:48,196 --> 01:27:03,167
"same place. It's a plane of negative energy and
darkness. A tower, you said? I have to go research

1302
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:14,658
"this some more. This is good to know, but I get
the sense that perhaps this ritual was not as

1303
01:27:14,658 --> 01:27:17,554
"foiled as we had initially anticipated."

1304
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:18,967
LAURA: Oh no.

1305
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,325
TRAVIS: Have you been to this Shadowfell before?

1306
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:22,869
MATT: "I have not been."

1307
01:27:22,869 --> 01:27:26,590
LAURA: Does Vecna reside there?

1308
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:29,147
MATT: "I may go do some research."

1309
01:27:29,147 --> 01:27:31,382
LAURA: Fuck.

1310
01:27:31,382 --> 01:27:37,695
MATT: You watch her get a little thousand-yard
stare for a second, thinking. Her eyes are darting

1311
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:51,734
around a little bit and her brain is just running
and running. "All right. Well, unfortunately, I

1312
01:27:51,734 --> 01:27:59,468
"can't leave until tomorrow, I can only really
transport myself once a day, but I'll immediately

1313
01:27:59,468 --> 01:28:04,442
"make my way to Vasselheim. That would hopefully be
able to clarify some of these questions."

1314
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:09,694
LAURA: Do you need company?

1315
01:28:09,694 --> 01:28:13,366
MATT: "No, I can travel faster on my own."

1316
01:28:13,366 --> 01:28:14,878
LAURA: All right.

1317
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:20,338
MATT: "Besides, I can always go ahead and bring a
friend."

1318
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,107
LAURA: How is Kima?

1319
01:28:22,107 --> 01:28:24,967
MATT: Make a perception check, actually.

1320
01:28:25,122 --> 01:28:27,682
SAM: She's in the room.

1321
01:28:27,837 --> 01:28:32,070
LAURA: 21.

1322
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:40,702
MATT: 21? Interesting. One thing you do catch,
though subtle, is as she has her hands folded on

1323
01:28:40,702 --> 01:28:47,007
one side you do see a small gold band across one
of her fingers.

1324
01:28:47,007 --> 01:28:48,265
SAM: She's hitched!

1325
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:50,874
LAURA: Wait a minute! Did you guys get married?

1326
01:28:50,874 --> 01:28:56,645
MATT: "It was very small, very private, but
anyway--"

1327
01:28:56,645 --> 01:29:01,601
LIAM: Congratulations!

1328
01:29:01,601 --> 01:29:14,475
MATT: "Thank you. Sorry, this is conflicting
emotions in this moment right now. Thank you."

1329
01:29:14,544 --> 01:29:16,466
LAURA: When did it happen?!

1330
01:29:16,622 --> 01:29:19,704
(laughter)

1331
01:29:19,773 --> 01:29:30,371
MATT: "Naught but four months ago. It was on a whim.
We thought and discussed a lot about all the

1332
01:29:30,371 --> 01:29:36,200
"dangers we'd faced over the years together, and
with you and the reality of not knowing how long

1333
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:42,037
"either of us have on this planet. I figured at the
very least, why not?"

1334
01:29:42,037 --> 01:29:46,685
LAURA: I think it's brilliant. Brilliant.

1335
01:29:46,685 --> 01:29:57,792
MATT: "Thank you. We were going to tell you.
There's been a lot to do in Emon. It's looking

1336
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:01,769
"great, by the way. We've nearly completed. Thanks
to the help of the Lyceum and many of the mages,

1337
01:30:01,769 --> 01:30:05,901
"reconstruction has been rapid."

1338
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:12,531
LAURA: We really should have gone there in the
last year. We need to visit Emon.

1339
01:30:12,531 --> 01:30:14,187
TALIESIN: We've been very busy.

1340
01:30:14,187 --> 01:30:15,519
LAURA: True.

1341
01:30:15,571 --> 01:30:18,966
MATT: Then she covers the hand and is
embarrassed.

1342
01:30:19,015 --> 01:30:23,857
TALIESIN: We can get you back there today, if you
think time is of the essence.

1343
01:30:23,857 --> 01:30:26,067
MARISHA: I was in Emon not that long ago.

1344
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:28,048
TALIESIN: Why did you go to Emon?

1345
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:32,004
MARISHA: I had to talk to them about constructing
the crisis orbs.

1346
01:30:32,004 --> 01:30:33,373
LAURA: Oh! That's true.

1347
01:30:33,373 --> 01:30:36,996
MARISHA: It was a <i>lot</i> of meetings. So many damn
meetings.

1348
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:46,056
MATT: "If you could actually send me to the Lyceum
instead, and from there I can go to Vasselheim,

1349
01:30:46,056 --> 01:30:47,950
"but I can do my research there."

1350
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,321
MARISHA: You want to go to the Lyceum?

1351
01:30:49,321 --> 01:30:50,153
MATT: "Yes."

1352
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:51,024
MARISHA: Right now?

1353
01:30:51,024 --> 01:30:52,826
MATT: "Well, it's whenever you wish."

1354
01:30:52,826 --> 01:30:54,243
MARISHA: You want me to send you?

1355
01:30:54,243 --> 01:30:56,063
TRAVIS: I'm going to reset Keyleth's brain.

1356
01:30:56,063 --> 01:31:01,139
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Through the tree?

1357
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:02,965
TRAVIS: I'm going to jog her memory.

1358
01:31:02,965 --> 01:31:07,279
MARISHA: Is there anyone else that needs to go
while I'm doing this? Because this is it for the

1359
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:10,837
day. Anyone else need to go to Emon?

1360
01:31:10,837 --> 01:31:12,690
TALIESIN: I think we're good.

1361
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:15,820
TRAVIS: Literally nobody needs to go there but
her.

1362
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:18,236
MARISHA: No Kima?

1363
01:31:18,236 --> 01:31:19,955
MATT: Kima's not with her.

1364
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:22,469
MARISHA: I just didn't know if she wanted to go
get her.

1365
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:24,266
LAURA: Oh my god, Keyleth.

1366
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:26,361
LIAM: You got a little bit of sleep stuff still in
your eye.

1367
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:27,968
LAURA: Eye bogeys, for sure.

1368
01:31:27,968 --> 01:31:29,576
LIAM: Yeah, that's better.

1369
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:32,138
MARISHA: I was just asking. Okay, let's go.

1370
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:36,519
MATT: All right, so as you open the gate and
Allura steps through, she around with a smile.

1371
01:31:36,519 --> 01:31:38,948
"Thank you, Keyleth. And--"

1372
01:31:38,948 --> 01:31:43,178
MARISHA: I say, (whispering) 'sup, Sun Tree?
And then send her through.

1373
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,666
MATT: (laughing) As she's trying to talk to you,
she's like, (stutters). And you just push her

1374
01:31:45,703 --> 01:31:48,188
through. She's like, "Whoa!"

1375
01:31:48,188 --> 01:31:49,565
MARISHA: Okay, bye.

1376
01:31:49,565 --> 01:31:50,971
MATT: (thud) And it closes.

1377
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:55,146
TALIESIN: Why are you awake? Nothing. Never mind.

1378
01:31:55,146 --> 01:31:58,828
MATT: All right. So. What do you guys want to do?

1379
01:31:58,828 --> 01:32:06,315
LAURA: Well, shit! Well, what do we do now that we
know? I guess we just research?

1380
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:13,796
TALIESIN: This changes everything. I'm changing
the research focus in the library specifically to

1381
01:32:13,796 --> 01:32:16,933
things on this subject so that we can more focus.

1382
01:32:16,933 --> 01:32:21,406
MATT: Okay. JB comes down with you and starts
helping catalog and pulling out books and

1383
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:22,510
information.

1384
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,215
TRAVIS: I'll help you go read, too. And I start
reading my book.

1385
01:32:25,215 --> 01:32:31,820
LAURA: Oh shit. Hilda. Did anybody go down to the
bakery?

1386
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,511
SAM: She was going to come see us.

1387
01:32:33,511 --> 01:32:37,768
MATT: Yeah, you haven't. It's around noon now, as
all this has happened and talking with her.

1388
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:39,311
TALIESIN: She was going to come to the castle.

1389
01:32:39,311 --> 01:32:42,707
LAURA: Yeah, but-- okay.

1390
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:45,103
MATT: Tary still hasn't woken up, by the way.

1391
01:32:45,103 --> 01:32:48,785
SAM: I'm currently-- Doty is brushing my teeth.

1392
01:32:48,785 --> 01:32:50,815
TRAVIS: Brushing your teeth?

1393
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:59,547
MATT: That's not true. Because eventually when you
go to check on his room, Taryon isn't there.

1394
01:32:59,547 --> 01:33:03,497
LAURA and MARISHA: What?

1395
01:33:03,497 --> 01:33:06,665
LIAM: Sam...

1396
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:10,683
MARISHA: He's not going to Sam Riegel us again, is
he? Because I can't handle that right now.

1397
01:33:10,683 --> 01:33:13,129
LAURA: Where is Tary? Did he leave a note?

1398
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,565
MATT: As you enter the room--

1399
01:33:14,565 --> 01:33:15,889
SAM (whispers) Hilda ate me.

1400
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:17,914
LAURA: Oh my god, did Hilda do something?

1401
01:33:17,914 --> 01:33:25,510
MATT: You can see the sheet is missing. Most of
his personal belongings are gone. Doty is still

1402
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:31,592
there. And Doty appears to be shut down,
nonfunctional.

1403
01:33:31,592 --> 01:33:37,674
LAURA: Doty? Doty! Shit!

1404
01:33:37,674 --> 01:33:39,395
MATT: The eyes are cold.

1405
01:33:39,395 --> 01:33:40,832
TALIESIN: Check the book!

1406
01:33:40,832 --> 01:33:41,851
LAURA: What book?

1407
01:33:41,851 --> 01:33:42,804
TALIESIN: Doty's book.

1408
01:33:42,804 --> 01:33:44,515
LAURA: Oh! I go look at Doty's book!

1409
01:33:44,515 --> 01:33:46,953
MATT: It's within his chest compartment.

1410
01:33:46,953 --> 01:33:51,429
TALIESIN: I know. I helped build this thing. Can I
figure out how to get the book to eject?

1411
01:33:51,429 --> 01:33:52,837
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1412
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:57,073
LAURA: I'm searching around the room, looking for
any sign of Tary.

1413
01:33:57,073 --> 01:34:00,536
TALIESIN: That's so cocked. That's a natural 20.

1414
01:34:00,536 --> 01:34:05,973
MATT: Okay. Not only do you find the latch, but
you look underneath where one of the arms is.

1415
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:12,429
There appears to be a small glass bead, affixed
with a piece of clay. And the bead has this

1416
01:34:12,429 --> 01:34:19,873
pulsing blue light on it. And you notice it there,
and it looks like it's the only thing with any

1417
01:34:19,873 --> 01:34:21,599
sort of life on Doty's exterior.

1418
01:34:21,599 --> 01:34:24,856
TALIESIN: Does that look like part of Doty?

1419
01:34:24,856 --> 01:34:27,893
MATT: It doesn't. It looks like something that was
pressed onto him.

1420
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:29,358
LAURA: Should we take it off?

1421
01:34:29,358 --> 01:34:32,436
TALIESIN: Is it magical?

1422
01:34:32,436 --> 01:34:34,610
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1423
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:42,304
TALIESIN: That's a 21.

1424
01:34:42,304 --> 01:34:47,740
MATT: It does appear to be magical. It is giving
some sort of consistent pulse of energy.

1425
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:51,646
LAURA: Maybe don't touch it.

1426
01:34:51,646 --> 01:35:03,863
MATT: It looks fragile, whatever it is. The
essence of the magic that you get from it, the

1427
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:11,731
nature of the effect, at least, is abjuration.

1428
01:35:11,731 --> 01:35:13,019
LAURA: Abjuration?

1429
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:15,659
TALIESIN: I genuinely don't actually know what
this word means.

1430
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:17,016
LAURA: I have no idea what that word means,
either.

1431
01:35:17,016 --> 01:35:18,732
SAM: I've seen it in the Player's Handbook.

1432
01:35:18,732 --> 01:35:19,779
LAURA: Yeah, what is it?

1433
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:23,348
TALIESIN: I normally have some clue about a word.

1434
01:35:23,348 --> 01:35:24,860
MATT: Abjuration is one of the schools of arcane
magic.

1435
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,604
LAURA: What kind of school is it?

1436
01:35:27,604 --> 01:35:36,804
MATT: (laughs) It's the alteration and harnessing
of raw arcane energy. Usually in some sort of--

1437
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:41,703
there are a number of spells that fall into the
category.

1438
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:46,796
LAURA: Shit. Shit, we just sent Allura away. Fuck.
Balls.

1439
01:35:46,796 --> 01:35:50,639
TALIESIN: Should we call everyone? Let's not call
everyone. Who should we call?

1440
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,602
LAURA: I don't know.

1441
01:35:53,602 --> 01:36:01,339
TALIESIN: Let's call everyone. Has anybody seen
Tary?

1442
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:03,163
LIAM: He's sleeping in, isn't he?

1443
01:36:03,163 --> 01:36:04,337
TALIESIN: He's not.

1444
01:36:04,337 --> 01:36:05,823
ASHLEY: Is he at the bakery?

1445
01:36:05,823 --> 01:36:08,867
LAURA: Wait, go check the bakery. Will someone go
check the bakery?

1446
01:36:08,867 --> 01:36:10,117
ASHLEY: I'll check the bakery.

1447
01:36:10,117 --> 01:36:12,269
LIAM: Where are you?

1448
01:36:12,269 --> 01:36:13,712
LAURA: Do I see any trace of him?

1449
01:36:13,712 --> 01:36:16,932
MATT: Make an investigation check again.

1450
01:36:16,932 --> 01:36:18,408
MARISHA: Castle?

1451
01:36:18,408 --> 01:36:20,436
LIAM: No, they're at Vex's house.

1452
01:36:20,436 --> 01:36:23,916
LAURA: 15.

1453
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:27,872
TALIESIN: Can you have some coffee and come down
here, quickly?

1454
01:36:27,872 --> 01:36:32,102
MARISHA: Oh my god! Coffee sounds amazing to me.

1455
01:36:32,102 --> 01:36:33,132
LAURA: Keyleth!

1456
01:36:33,132 --> 01:36:34,213
MARISHA: Yeah?

1457
01:36:34,213 --> 01:36:35,407
TALIESIN: Yes, what?

1458
01:36:35,407 --> 01:36:36,288
LAURA: Focus.

1459
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:37,423
TALIESIN: Three coffees.

1460
01:36:37,423 --> 01:36:45,564
MARISHA: Three coffees coming right up. I'll be
right over. I get three coffees and I head over.

1461
01:36:45,564 --> 01:36:53,910
MATT: Okay. It's hard to pick up a lot of details.
It looks like there was no struggle whatsoever. It

1462
01:36:53,910 --> 01:37:05,170
looks like somebody entered and picked the lock to
the room from the inside. That's all you're able

1463
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:08,173
to make out. From the inside of the castle.

1464
01:37:08,173 --> 01:37:09,723
SAM: Oh, from the inside of the <i>castle.</i>

1465
01:37:09,832 --> 01:37:10,921
MATT: Yeah.

1466
01:37:10,921 --> 01:37:15,571
LAURA: Somebody that was in the castle did this?
In <i>my</i> house?

1467
01:37:15,571 --> 01:37:17,971
LIAM: Sam, why don't you just tell us where you
are?

1468
01:37:17,971 --> 01:37:20,550
SAM: Sure. Doty is brushing my teeth.

1469
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:25,890
LAURA: Did you end up opening the thing? Can you
see Doty's book?

1470
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,872
TALIESIN: I popped the book out, right?

1471
01:37:28,872 --> 01:37:33,836
MATT: You found the compartment where you (click,
creak). It opens up and the tome is there.

1472
01:37:33,836 --> 01:37:40,209
TALIESIN: I have my things upstairs. One second.
I'm going to get all of my tools. I have

1473
01:37:40,209 --> 01:37:44,312
everything on me including the cloak, because I
want to be able to absorb any magic that comes off

1474
01:37:44,312 --> 01:37:49,757
of what looks like possibly a bomb? Just going to
be careful. I'm going to

1475
01:37:49,757 --> 01:37:51,407
very gently remove the book.

1476
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:53,887
MATT: You pull it out of the compartment.

1477
01:37:53,887 --> 01:37:56,091
TALIESIN: Flip to the last written page.

1478
01:37:56,091 --> 01:38:12,444
MATT: The last written page spoke of, "An evening
of curious bakery purveyors signed on to see to

1479
01:38:12,444 --> 01:38:22,254
"the future of goods, and to create in the name of
the great Taryon Darrington and associates. And as

1480
01:38:22,254 --> 01:38:28,727
"a sudden slumber comes over me, I will find myself
an evening's rest. Goodnight, Doty." And that was

1481
01:38:28,727 --> 01:38:30,326
the final entry.

1482
01:38:30,326 --> 01:38:32,889
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for Keyleth. I'm putting the
book back.

1483
01:38:32,889 --> 01:38:36,138
LAURA: The top sheet is gone from the bed.

1484
01:38:36,138 --> 01:38:37,962
TRAVIS: Yeah, because they took him away in it.

1485
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:40,960
LAURA: Is it an eyelash? Do I get a wish?

1486
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,032
ASHLEY: (whispers) Yeah.

1487
01:38:42,032 --> 01:38:44,054
LAURA: Wait, get it so that I can make a wish.

1488
01:38:44,054 --> 01:38:47,144
TALIESIN: Thankfully, we have a scry spell or
two.

1489
01:38:47,144 --> 01:38:50,565
MATT: Keyleth, you arrive with three coffees.

1490
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:51,880
LIAM: I tag along.

1491
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,531
MARISHA: Okay, I have two regular, one decaf no
foam--

1492
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:59,268
LAURA: Keyleth, scry on Tary. Pike, did you find
anything at the bakery?

1493
01:38:59,268 --> 01:39:04,056
MATT: As you hurry down to the bakery, the bakery
is still closed. Nobody was there to open it.

1494
01:39:04,056 --> 01:39:05,371
ASHLEY: Is Hilda there?

1495
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:06,968
MATT: Hilda is not there, no.

1496
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:11,486
ASHLEY: I don't see anything here, Hilda's not
here.

1497
01:39:11,486 --> 01:39:13,659
LAURA: The bakery looks normal?

1498
01:39:13,659 --> 01:39:15,267
ASHLEY: The bakery looks normal.

1499
01:39:15,267 --> 01:39:18,045
MATT: Locked and closed, untouched since you left
it the evening before.

1500
01:39:18,045 --> 01:39:19,762
MARISHA: Wait, you think Doty's been
boobytrapped?

1501
01:39:19,762 --> 01:39:21,807
TALIESIN: Look at that. That doesn't look normal.

1502
01:39:21,807 --> 01:39:27,096
LIAM: I want to a take a look at that and see if
it looks like a trap, and I don't understand

1503
01:39:27,096 --> 01:39:29,905
magic, but if it is similar to any trigger
mechanisms that I've seen.

1504
01:39:29,905 --> 01:39:31,284
MATT: Make a investigation check.

1505
01:39:31,284 --> 01:39:33,138
LAURA: Keyleth, come out of the room with me.

1506
01:39:33,138 --> 01:39:36,010
LIAM: 31.

1507
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:40,980
MATT: Okay, it does not appear to be a trap,
necessarily. It looks like whatever it's meant to

1508
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,654
be triggered to do has already been triggered.

1509
01:39:43,654 --> 01:39:50,766
LAURA: (gasps) Somebody boobytrapped Doty. Can you
scry on Taryon? Scry on Taryon.

1510
01:39:50,766 --> 01:39:53,049
MARISHA: Yeah, what-- I'm sorry.

1511
01:39:53,049 --> 01:39:54,146
LAURA: He's missing.

1512
01:39:54,146 --> 01:39:55,077
MARISHA: What?

1513
01:39:55,077 --> 01:39:58,592
LAURA: He's missing. Somebody broke in and took
him. I go around and start asking-- no, I'm going

1514
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:01,431
to stay right here. Will you scry on him? I need
to find out what happened.

1515
01:40:01,431 --> 01:40:04,913
MARISHA: Okay, last time I tried to scry on
Scanlan, everyone gave me

1516
01:40:04,913 --> 01:40:06,449
a lot of grief about it.

1517
01:40:06,449 --> 01:40:12,203
LAURA: Okay, Scanlan left on his own. Tary didn't.
He left Doty here. There is no way this was not

1518
01:40:12,203 --> 01:40:13,520
foul play.

1519
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,370
LIAM: Do you think this thing is looking at us?
This little bead?

1520
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:22,755
TALIESIN: Once everyone clears out of the room, I
will try and remove it.

1521
01:40:22,755 --> 01:40:24,709
MARISHA: Who is all in the room? Is it the four of
us?

1522
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:26,949
LAURA: No, me and you, we went outside.

1523
01:40:26,949 --> 01:40:28,542
MATT: It is just Vax and Percy.

1524
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:29,808
TALIESIN: I am going to try and remove it.

1525
01:40:29,808 --> 01:40:34,879
LIAM: Yeah, I don't think it's trapped or
anything. You probably can do that.

1526
01:40:34,879 --> 01:40:39,220
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens. I'm going to use
the cloak to pull it off so that I'm shielded from

1527
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,787
it if anything happens.

1528
01:40:40,787 --> 01:40:46,240
MATT: Okay, you grab it, and as you pull it off,
it's fixed and as you pull it off, the bead

1529
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:53,238
shatters in your hand and the blue spark fizzles
out and you watch Doty go, "Tary."

1530
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:56,358
LIAM: Looks like the bead shut him down.

1531
01:40:56,358 --> 01:41:02,111
MATT: You get the sense that the basis of this
magic was a one-use Dispel.

1532
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:09,304
LAURA: We're not in the room. You're scrying. Will
you scry?

1533
01:41:09,304 --> 01:41:18,845
MATT: You watch as Doty immediately starts going
"Tary?" and lifts the bed. "Tary?"

1534
01:41:18,845 --> 01:41:22,271
MARISHA: It'd be better if I had something of
Tary's.

1535
01:41:22,316 --> 01:41:26,117
MATT: Doty leaves and charges through the room and
(footsteps) into the hallway.

1536
01:41:26,117 --> 01:41:28,368
LAURA: Doty? Doty, come here.

1537
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:29,405
MARISHA: Hey, Doty.

1538
01:41:29,405 --> 01:41:31,286
LAURA: Doty belonged to him. Scry with Doty.

1539
01:41:31,286 --> 01:41:33,336
MARISHA: What's up, bud?

1540
01:41:33,336 --> 01:41:35,425
MATT: Doty stops and looks. "Tary?"

1541
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:50,268
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to Professor Xavier this
shit and put my hands on Doty's little head. Come

1542
01:41:50,268 --> 01:42:01,199
here, bend down. Down, Doty. Doty, down. Doty,
kneel! Doty, take a knee. Doty, down.

1543
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:06,293
LAURA: Doty? Will you kneel down, please? Fuck.

1544
01:42:06,293 --> 01:42:12,179
MARISHA: You know what? It's fine. And I'm going
to do the scry.

1545
01:42:12,179 --> 01:42:13,580
MATT: Okay.

1546
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:20,819
LAURA: Do you know what is happening right now?

1547
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:23,883
SAM: I'm getting my rogue character ready.

1548
01:42:23,883 --> 01:42:35,335
MATT: Keyleth. Your vision pulls back up into the
sky above the clouds. For a second, you feel a

1549
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:44,067
rush of wind; you're not sure of the direction.
You feel a flash of speed and then with a blink,

1550
01:42:44,067 --> 01:42:49,745
all of a sudden your vision is above what appears
to be a small village along a road. And the vision

1551
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:58,209
blinks once again and you're within a hallway, a
wooden low-lit hallway, and then the flash. You're

1552
01:42:58,209 --> 01:43:06,310
inside of a room. A wood paneling wall. You see
Taryon, unconscious and wrapped in a sheet, still

1553
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:13,170
in his armor, propped against the shaded side of
the wall, while a figure stands just out of the

1554
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:20,800
peripheral. A familiar voice from just out of your
range says, "It's okay, dear. We just had a bit to

1555
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:28,098
"drink. Appreciate your concern." And you hear the
door close (click). Then a few footsteps, and you

1556
01:43:28,098 --> 01:43:33,337
watch as in the peripheral, Hilda steps in next to
Taryon, pulling the sheet from his body, revealing

1557
01:43:33,337 --> 01:43:43,105
him tied up from head to toe. Hilda's image
shimmers slightly and dissipates, revealing a

1558
01:43:43,105 --> 01:43:52,731
woman of ink-blue skin, long white hair tied into
almost a topknot ponytail. Pale silver eyes that

1559
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:59,012
inspect her handiwork. Under her dark green cloak
that you see her hood fall back, you see dark

1560
01:43:59,012 --> 01:44:07,652
burgundy leather armor. She seems to check
Taryon's vitals, under his neck, feel for

1561
01:44:07,652 --> 01:44:12,618
breathing. Very methodically, and begins to loosen
some of his bindings in some places. And you hear

1562
01:44:12,618 --> 01:44:18,868
her voice say, "Can't have you losing too much
circulation, boy. I've got a reputation to keep."

1563
01:44:18,868 --> 01:44:25,242
She quickly tosses the blanket back over him after
fixing the straps and goes, "Sleep soundly, boy.

1564
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:32,102
You'll be home soon enough." She stands up and
walks across the room, almost out of sight, and

1565
01:44:32,102 --> 01:44:36,184
sits in the chair facing him. You watch her
rummage through her satchel, pull out a cream

1566
01:44:36,184 --> 01:44:40,191
puff, and throw it to the side of the corner.
Pulls out a small box and begins making

1567
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,587
something.

1568
01:44:41,587 --> 01:44:43,276
MARISHA: I don't know what she is making?

1569
01:44:43,276 --> 01:44:44,647
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

1570
01:44:44,647 --> 01:44:48,470
SAM: She probably bought those cream puffs and
didn't even bake them herself!

1571
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:53,203
TRAVIS: It was Ralph's cream puffs.

1572
01:44:53,264 --> 01:44:58,264
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, okay. Just
straight intelligence?

1573
01:44:58,264 --> 01:44:59,216
MATT: Yeah.

1574
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:00,178
MARISHA: 17.

1575
01:45:00,178 --> 01:45:06,074
MATT: You've seen Vex do this before. It is a
fletching kit. She is in the process of making

1576
01:45:06,074 --> 01:45:06,959
arrows.

1577
01:45:06,959 --> 01:45:09,433
MARISHA: She's making arrows?

1578
01:45:09,433 --> 01:45:14,852
MATT: She's making arrows in a casual
passing-her-time way. And then the vision pulls

1579
01:45:15,004 --> 01:45:17,644
you back (whoosh) and you're within yourself once
more.

1580
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,019
MARISHA: (gasps)

1581
01:45:19,019 --> 01:45:20,199
LAURA: What did you see?

1582
01:45:20,199 --> 01:45:24,131
MARISHA: (shouting) Bitch! Fucking bitch! God!

1583
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:25,624
LAURA: Where is he? Who has him?

1584
01:45:25,624 --> 01:45:27,552
MARISHA: (shouting) People wonder why we have
trust issues!

1585
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,029
LAURA: Who, what--

1586
01:45:29,029 --> 01:45:35,260
MARISHA: (shouting) It's fucking Hilda! She's a
vampire or a werewolf or a lich or something. I

1587
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:41,041
don't know. Don't quote me on any of this. She was
just like, I don't want your vitals going down and

1588
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:44,840
why do people take everything away from us?

1589
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,292
LAURA: Slap her across the face.

1590
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:47,555
MARISHA: (yelps)

1591
01:45:47,555 --> 01:45:48,521
LAURA: Hey!

1592
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:49,535
MARISHA: Ow!

1593
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:50,454
LAURA: Okay.

1594
01:45:50,454 --> 01:45:51,288
MARISHA: Okay.

1595
01:45:51,288 --> 01:45:53,996
LAURA: Can you fucking calm down and tell me what
you saw?

1596
01:45:53,996 --> 01:45:55,585
LIAM: Did you see Tary-town?

1597
01:45:55,585 --> 01:45:56,854
MARISHA: I saw Tary.

1598
01:45:56,854 --> 01:45:59,385
LAURA: Is he in trouble? Is he in danger?

1599
01:45:59,385 --> 01:46:06,890
MARISHA: Yeah, he looked unconscious, and it was
Hilda, and she had ink-blue, sparkly skin.

1600
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:11,787
MATT: Not sparkly, necessarily. Ink-blue skin,
silver eyes.

1601
01:46:11,787 --> 01:46:17,673
MARISHA: Ink-blue skin and long silvery hair that
was in a top long ponytail thing. Long green-- and

1602
01:46:17,673 --> 01:46:27,056
she had burgundy armor. He was in a wooden room,
somewhere.

1603
01:46:27,056 --> 01:46:28,395
LAURA: Is it close by?

1604
01:46:28,395 --> 01:46:29,875
MATT: Her ears were pointed.

1605
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:34,920
MARISHA: In a hallway. Her ears were pointy. I
know a lot of people have pointy ears, including

1606
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,075
myself, so I'm not judging anyone who has pointy
ears.

1607
01:46:38,075 --> 01:46:39,529
LIAM: Was she a drow?

1608
01:46:39,529 --> 01:46:46,669
MATT: You, Keyleth, who have not actually seen a
drow elf in person, really, over an extended

1609
01:46:46,669 --> 01:46:52,031
period of time to know much about their culture,
but through this conversation, she does appear to

1610
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:53,516
be, yes.

1611
01:46:53,516 --> 01:46:56,629
MARISHA: She sounds like those things you have
said before. Yes.

1612
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:57,576
LAURA: The drow?

1613
01:46:57,576 --> 01:47:07,961
MARISHA: The drow, yeah. Like us but blue skin,
white hair. And she said she doesn't want him

1614
01:47:07,961 --> 01:47:13,705
losing too much of his vitality, and that she was
going to take him back to where he came from and

1615
01:47:13,705 --> 01:47:15,127
that he was special.

1616
01:47:15,127 --> 01:47:16,901
LAURA: (gasps) She was bringing him home?

1617
01:47:16,901 --> 01:47:18,400
MARISHA: Yeah, she was bringing him home.

1618
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,987
LAURA: To his piece of shit family?

1619
01:47:19,987 --> 01:47:21,862
MARISHA: To his piece of shit family!

1620
01:47:21,862 --> 01:47:23,413
LAURA: We have to get him. We have to help him.

1621
01:47:23,413 --> 01:47:25,964
MARISHA: But why is Tary special?

1622
01:47:25,964 --> 01:47:30,303
LAURA: He's very rich. I'm sure his family is just
looking for him.

1623
01:47:30,303 --> 01:47:32,534
LIAM: Yeah, he is daddy's boy.

1624
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:37,029
MARISHA: I don't know. This seems like she was
interested in something other than his money.

1625
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:41,046
LIAM: Well. It's irrelevant, though. We've
got to go get him.

1626
01:47:41,046 --> 01:47:42,335
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

1627
01:47:42,335 --> 01:47:47,063
TALIESIN: It just means we knock her unconscious
as opposed to killing her when we get there. It

1628
01:47:47,124 --> 01:47:49,088
will be fun. Let's do this.

1629
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:54,842
MARISHA: Do I have any idea of the hallway and the
room, of how far away it was?

1630
01:47:54,842 --> 01:48:01,203
MATT: It felt like some sort of roadside inn.
That's you have no idea where.

1631
01:48:01,203 --> 01:48:05,006
TALIESIN: Well, this we can deal with. A roadside
inn. We know were Tary comes from.

1632
01:48:05,006 --> 01:48:08,174
MARISHA: He could be literally anywhere within a
hundred-mile radius.

1633
01:48:08,174 --> 01:48:15,845
TALIESIN: We know which roads one would take to
get there from Whitestone, conveniently?

1634
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:23,055
MATT: From what you know, the town of Deastok that
he comes from, which is in Wildmount. There are no

1635
01:48:23,055 --> 01:48:26,810
roads that go there from Whitestone because it is
across the Shearing Channel to the other

1636
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:31,808
continent. Which means you have to either go by
boat-- and even then, it's probably a few hundred

1637
01:48:31,808 --> 01:48:34,873
miles away from Whitestone on that side of the
continent.

1638
01:48:34,873 --> 01:48:37,991
TALIESIN: We could do a Locate Object.

1639
01:48:37,991 --> 01:48:41,541
LAURA: Yeah, on his dangling earring.

1640
01:48:41,541 --> 01:48:46,233
MATT: It's a hundred-foot range.

1641
01:48:46,233 --> 01:48:49,671
LAURA: I thought it was a thousand feet range.

1642
01:48:49,909 --> 01:48:51,282
MATT: Sorry, a thousand-foot range.

1643
01:48:51,282 --> 01:48:53,083
LAURA: Which is still very, very close.

1644
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:55,306
MARISHA: Or very far, when jumping off a cliff.

1645
01:48:55,306 --> 01:48:57,575
ASHLEY: What if he's still here?

1646
01:48:57,575 --> 01:49:09,745
LAURA: Okay wait, what if I use primeval
awareness-- I can't search out a drow. No, fuck.

1647
01:49:09,804 --> 01:49:16,931
Can I look around to see if there's any tracks or
any hint of anything that she may have dropped in

1648
01:49:16,992 --> 01:49:19,459
the room or anything that he might have dropped?

1649
01:49:19,459 --> 01:49:23,408
TALIESIN: Go check Hilda's house, as well, for
clues.

1650
01:49:23,408 --> 01:49:28,210
MATT: Searching the room... you searched it once
before. Looking over it with a second glance,

1651
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:32,911
there doesn't appear to be any sign of anything
that she dropped. The best you can tell,

1652
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:37,421
especially being a tracker, there doesn't appear
to be any sign that either of them left the room.

1653
01:49:37,421 --> 01:49:42,186
There was nowhere they could have gone. There is
no window that exits, then the door was picked,

1654
01:49:42,186 --> 01:49:44,863
and nobody saw anybody leave the room.

1655
01:49:44,863 --> 01:49:47,988
LAURA: She bamfed out. She's got magic. She could
be anywhere.

1656
01:49:47,988 --> 01:49:49,789
TALIESIN: Then why is she at an inn?

1657
01:49:49,789 --> 01:49:52,383
LAURA: Are we sure she was at an inn?

1658
01:49:52,383 --> 01:49:57,875
TALIESIN: Well, if she is at what sounds like a
waypoint, and if you can travel as far as you

1659
01:49:57,875 --> 01:49:59,746
want, why would you need a waypoint?

1660
01:49:59,746 --> 01:50:02,192
MARISHA: Actually, who is good at math? Oh, Percy!
You're good at math.

1661
01:50:02,192 --> 01:50:04,170
TALIESIN: I am good at math, why? What sort of
math?

1662
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:06,914
MARISHA: Well, when was the last time we saw
Tary?

1663
01:50:06,914 --> 01:50:08,081
TALIESIN: Last night.

1664
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:09,207
MARISHA: Yeah.

1665
01:50:09,207 --> 01:50:10,920
SAM: Train traveling...

1666
01:50:10,959 --> 01:50:14,223
MARISHA: Exactly. A train traveling by foot.

1667
01:50:14,223 --> 01:50:16,546
LIAM: A Tree Stride spell traveling. Yeah.

1668
01:50:16,546 --> 01:50:20,147
TALIESIN: It wasn't necessary a bamf. It might
have just been, in and out, get on a horse and

1669
01:50:20,147 --> 01:50:21,292
head towards--

1670
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:22,512
LIAM: That's a lot of ifs, though.

1671
01:50:22,512 --> 01:50:23,781
LAURA: But she didn't leave the room.

1672
01:50:23,781 --> 01:50:26,525
MARISHA: She was making arrows.

1673
01:50:26,525 --> 01:50:31,662
ASHLEY: I've made my way upstairs?

1674
01:50:31,662 --> 01:50:33,278
MATT: Yeah, you've come back at this point now.

1675
01:50:33,278 --> 01:50:36,481
ASHLEY: Well, Hilda never showed up for her
interview!

1676
01:50:36,481 --> 01:50:41,170
(laughter)

1677
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:46,018
ASHLEY: I don't think we should hire her, for one.
Where is he? Did you find him? Anything? Nothing?

1678
01:50:46,018 --> 01:50:53,395
TALIESIN: How far could they have gotten on
horseback? Within the reasonable--

1679
01:50:53,395 --> 01:51:02,132
MATT: Well, I mean. The last you saw him, it's
been probably 12 hours. On horseback, could have

1680
01:51:02,132 --> 01:51:10,735
gotten, I'd say, probably a little over 100 miles
or so.

1681
01:51:10,735 --> 01:51:17,674
TALIESIN: 100 miles. There's only so many roads
that lead out of the city. I'm pulling out a map

1682
01:51:17,674 --> 01:51:22,483
and I'm marking any roadside tavern that's within
100 miles of the city.

1683
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:26,846
LAURA: Doty? Do you know how to find Tary?

1684
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:29,168
MATT: "Doty. Taryon."

1685
01:51:29,168 --> 01:51:33,096
LAURA: Yes. Can you find him? Are you drawn to
him?

1686
01:51:33,096 --> 01:51:34,572
ASHLEY: Doty?

1687
01:51:34,572 --> 01:51:36,493
MATT: I know, it's one phrase.

1688
01:51:36,493 --> 01:51:39,224
TALIESIN: I can't make Doty do things, can I?

1689
01:51:39,224 --> 01:51:41,889
SAM: You can certainly try.

1690
01:51:41,889 --> 01:51:44,430
TALIESIN: Doty, look at me.

1691
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,658
MATT: "Tary?"

1692
01:51:45,658 --> 01:51:47,059
TALIESIN: Never mind.

1693
01:51:47,059 --> 01:51:49,518
ASHLEY: Doty? Do you know where Taryon went?

1694
01:51:49,518 --> 01:51:51,144
MATT: "Tary."

1695
01:51:51,144 --> 01:51:58,616
ASHLEY: I feel like-- could you give him the
book?

1696
01:51:58,616 --> 01:52:01,262
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah. I gave him the book back.
Yes.

1697
01:52:01,262 --> 01:52:04,478
ASHLEY: Could you draw something for me again?

1698
01:52:04,478 --> 01:52:08,409
MATT: "Tary?"

1699
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:15,574
LAURA: Try it. Give him the book. Give him some
paper and a pencil.

1700
01:52:15,574 --> 01:52:25,609
ASHLEY: Do you know where Taryon went? Can you
draw it? Shit, I thought he listened to me.

1701
01:52:25,609 --> 01:52:27,275
SAM: He does.

1702
01:52:27,275 --> 01:52:29,020
ASHLEY: He does listen to me.

1703
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:30,737
MATT: Well. The old Doty did.

1704
01:52:30,737 --> 01:52:33,222
SAM and LAURA: Oh fuck.

1705
01:52:33,222 --> 01:52:36,368
TRAVIS: And you had to lose that one.

1706
01:52:36,368 --> 01:52:42,629
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, Doty. You're new. You're
new Doty.

1707
01:52:42,629 --> 01:52:45,285
TALIESIN: Doty, don't do that.

1708
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:48,406
ASHLEY: Doty, don't do that. Doty, don't play
that.

1709
01:52:48,406 --> 01:53:05,029
TALIESIN: I've got a plan. I need to borrow the
scrying orb. I'm going to make a list. On a map,

1710
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:10,201
I'm going to mark every roadside inn within about
200 miles.

1711
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:15,626
MATT: Okay. There's a number of inns in the Turst
Fields. There's a couple at the Jorenn Village,

1712
01:53:15,626 --> 01:53:18,656
which you are familiar with. They might be just
outside of the range, but you put them on there as

1713
01:53:18,733 --> 01:53:24,147
well. Westruun, and along the road of the Silver
Cut.

1714
01:53:24,147 --> 01:53:28,198
MARISHA: What was that thing you said? Turns
field?

1715
01:53:28,198 --> 01:53:30,253
MATT: There's the Turst Fields.

1716
01:53:30,253 --> 01:53:33,615
MARISHA: And what was the other one?

1717
01:53:33,677 --> 01:53:37,706
MATT: Jorenn Village. That's where you found Percy
in prison.

1718
01:53:37,706 --> 01:53:41,370
TALIESIN: Okay. Where's the sun?

1719
01:53:41,370 --> 01:53:45,621
MATT: Right now? It's close to noon.

1720
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:50,917
TALIESIN: We'll finish this and I'll give it a few
hours for the sun to go down so that I can

1721
01:53:50,917 --> 01:53:54,011
actually figure out what direction the inn is
facing.

1722
01:53:54,011 --> 01:53:57,789
MARISHA: And I couldn't try and do a nature check
to try and figure out what direction the wind was coming

1723
01:53:57,906 --> 01:54:00,857
from when it hit me during the scry?

1724
01:54:00,857 --> 01:54:08,095
MATT: The wind was less of a natural wind and more
of just your vision being shifted. It would not

1725
01:54:08,095 --> 01:54:10,250
have an impact whatsoever.

1726
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:16,363
TALIESIN: Save the sphere. I've got a plan. In the
meantime, let's search Hilda's house.

1727
01:54:16,424 --> 01:54:20,903
LAURA: Yeah. Okay. We go and search Hilda's
house.

1728
01:54:20,903 --> 01:54:29,763
MATT: Okay. As you get to Hilda's home, you look
inside. It's dark on the interior. You knock.

1729
01:54:29,763 --> 01:54:30,979
There's no response.

1730
01:54:30,979 --> 01:54:34,958
LAURA: Does Trinket smell-- We go in-- Wait!
Sorry. Check for traps. Right.

1731
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:42,002
LIAM: 22. No, 24.

1732
01:54:42,002 --> 01:54:44,581
MATT: 24. It is locked, but it does not appear to
be trapped.

1733
01:54:44,581 --> 01:54:48,301
LIAM: All right. It's not locked anymore. 32.

1734
01:54:48,301 --> 01:54:52,766
MATT: Okay, yeah. It's a simple lock. As you walk
inside, you see the candle that was lit the other

1735
01:54:52,766 --> 01:54:56,757
night has melted entirely and the wax is dripping
off the side of the small bench

1736
01:54:56,757 --> 01:54:58,573
where it was laid on.

1737
01:54:58,573 --> 01:55:03,949
LIAM: One more in here. Is there any bullshit
hiding around in here? 29.

1738
01:55:03,949 --> 01:55:08,502
MATT: 29. There's no bullshit, necessarily, but
there is that pile of linens in the corner. You

1739
01:55:08,502 --> 01:55:15,327
see it shifting slightly, and as you pull off the
side you see there, bound, Hilda. She's like,

1740
01:55:15,327 --> 01:55:17,478
(muffled noises).

1741
01:55:17,478 --> 01:55:19,784
LIAM: All right, Whisper out, and I cut her free.

1742
01:55:19,784 --> 01:55:22,120
MATT: "Oh!"

1743
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,382
LIAM: You all right?

1744
01:55:23,382 --> 01:55:24,403
MATT: "I'm all right."

1745
01:55:24,403 --> 01:55:25,586
LIAM: What happened?

1746
01:55:25,586 --> 01:55:34,365
MATT: (stuttering) "Naught but a few days ago,
this blue-skinned woman came, and she seemed nice

1747
01:55:34,365 --> 01:55:36,848
"enough, and she asked me questions. She didn't
hurt me or nothing,

1748
01:55:36,848 --> 01:55:38,657
"she just asked a lot of questions."

1749
01:55:38,657 --> 01:55:41,632
LIAM: And you've met us before? No?

1750
01:55:41,632 --> 01:55:44,234
MATT: "No. I've seen you around town. People talk
about you, saying what you've

1751
01:55:44,234 --> 01:55:45,698
"done for the people..."

1752
01:55:45,698 --> 01:55:47,644
ASHLEY: Do you bake cream puffs?

1753
01:55:47,644 --> 01:55:49,250
MATT: "I have before, yeah."

1754
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:56,135
LAURA: Do you want to work in a bakery? Just
kidding. We were in the middle of something; we'll

1755
01:55:56,135 --> 01:55:57,377
talk to you later!

1756
01:55:57,377 --> 01:56:02,311
(laughter)

1757
01:56:02,311 --> 01:56:11,054
LAURA: Wait, does Trinket smell anything having to
do with-- can he smell a different smell? Can he

1758
01:56:11,054 --> 01:56:13,731
smell the evil Hilda?

1759
01:56:13,731 --> 01:56:17,263
MATT: Make a perception check with advantage for
Trinket.

1760
01:56:17,263 --> 01:56:21,291
LIAM: That's good. That's also pretty good.

1761
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:25,732
LAURA: Perception? That is 24!

1762
01:56:25,732 --> 01:56:32,868
MATT: Okay, Trinket goes, (sniffing, grunting) and
picks up what appears to be some sort of a scent.

1763
01:56:32,868 --> 01:56:37,384
LAURA: Yeah! Where did it go?

1764
01:56:37,384 --> 01:56:46,493
MATT: Not really a bloodhound-style scent, but a
decent scent. Guiding him around over the next

1765
01:56:46,493 --> 01:56:51,305
hour or so, and trying to go in the areas you know
he might have been, the last strong scent is in

1766
01:56:51,305 --> 01:56:53,776
Taryon's room, and there's no trail from there.

1767
01:56:53,776 --> 01:56:58,511
LAURA: Motherfucker. This is terrible. I feel like
we did this to him.

1768
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:04,528
TALIESIN: We're going to get him back. Now.

1769
01:57:04,528 --> 01:57:08,771
LAURA: He's just so vulnerable.

1770
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:17,690
TALIESIN: Right. Do I have enough of an angle on
the sun now, where this should be doable?

1771
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:19,778
MATT: To?

1772
01:57:19,778 --> 01:57:24,959
TALIESIN: Figure out which way is north, south,
east, and west if I try and scry on Tary?

1773
01:57:24,959 --> 01:57:30,339
MATT: Sure. Yeah, you gauge the sun in the sky.

1774
01:57:30,339 --> 01:57:34,558
TALIESIN: All right. Kiki, let's do this.

1775
01:57:34,558 --> 01:57:37,358
MARISHA: Am I helping you? Are we doing this
together?

1776
01:57:37,358 --> 01:57:39,724
TALIESIN: Well, you're giving me the orb, since
you have the orb.

1777
01:57:39,724 --> 01:57:41,040
MARISHA: I'm giving you the orb.

1778
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,700
TALIESIN: And I'm going to give it back to you
when I'm done.

1779
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:45,038
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like you did this before.

1780
01:57:45,038 --> 01:57:45,888
TALIESIN: I did.

1781
01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:47,226
MARISHA: Successfully.

1782
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:48,038
TALIESIN: Yes.

1783
01:57:48,038 --> 01:57:50,410
MARISHA: I underestimated you. Do you need my
help?

1784
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:51,512
TALIESIN: Sure.

1785
01:57:51,512 --> 01:57:52,622
MARISHA: Okay!

1786
01:57:52,622 --> 01:57:54,843
MATT: All right.

1787
01:57:54,843 --> 01:58:03,274
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and glean as much
information about the nature of the landscape

1788
01:58:03,274 --> 01:58:05,870
around the person that I'm focusing on as humanly
possible.

1789
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:06,727
MATT: Okay.

1790
01:58:06,727 --> 01:58:11,739
MARISHA: And I'm going to try and figure out a
discerned direction?

1791
01:58:11,739 --> 01:58:20,337
TALIESIN: Help with type of plants, whether or not
it's getting south, east, west. Not north. Most

1792
01:58:20,337 --> 01:58:21,663
probably south.

1793
01:58:21,663 --> 01:58:27,066
MATT: Okay. So, before you do that. You take the
orb and sit down and concentrate, and Keyleth aids

1794
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:33,479
you in setting up this small ritual. As you close your eyes
and focus on Taryon once more, your vision shifts

1795
01:58:33,629 --> 01:58:39,985
and seem to be jettisoned across hundreds of miles
within a second. No direction at the moment; it's

1796
01:58:39,985 --> 01:58:43,912
too much of a blur of color and light and movement
until it comes to a halt, and there you see

1797
01:58:43,912 --> 01:58:53,822
Taryon, somewhat jostled by the spell kicking in
and the momentum, you see him thrown over what

1798
01:58:53,822 --> 01:58:57,967
appears to be the back of a horse, just
(hoofbeats).

1799
01:58:57,967 --> 01:59:00,505
TALIESIN: Which way is the shadow of the horse?

1800
01:59:00,505 --> 01:59:04,445
MATT: Taryon, you come to consciousness ever so
slightly, and looking down, you see hooves

1801
01:59:04,445 --> 01:59:08,098
clattering on the ground behind you. You glance
around. Percival, I want you to go ahead and make

1802
01:59:08,098 --> 01:59:09,610
a nature check.

1803
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:14,087
LAURA: Come on! They're going to Wildmount.

1804
01:59:14,087 --> 01:59:21,849
TALIESIN: This is not my strong suit. That'll do,
though! 22.

1805
01:59:21,849 --> 01:59:29,489
MATT: 22. The skies here grow gray with clouds as
the mountain spire-peppered landscape is broken up

1806
01:59:29,489 --> 01:59:35,378
by far-reaching forests and river-traced glades.
The air appears cold, as the winter here seems to

1807
01:59:35,378 --> 01:59:40,958
cling to the countryside for a majority of the
year, a mixture of gloom and beauty as unique as it is

1808
01:59:41,019 --> 01:59:44,654
impressive. That's about as much as you can glean
from this standpoint. It's very blurred on the

1809
01:59:44,654 --> 01:59:54,168
outskirts. It seems similar to a harsher
Whitestone landscape. This is definitely further

1810
01:59:54,168 --> 02:00:00,979
east. Looking at placement of the sun in the sky,
it's further to the west.

1811
02:00:00,979 --> 02:00:08,145
TALIESIN: They've gone east. They're still on the
northern end of the continent, if they're on the

1812
02:00:08,145 --> 02:00:09,188
continent at all.

1813
02:00:09,188 --> 02:00:13,744
MATT: No, any further north from here and they'd
be in the water. For the time they've traveled,

1814
02:00:13,744 --> 02:00:17,280
they're east on Wildmount somewhere, you can
gather.

1815
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,619
TALIESIN: East on Wildmount. Is there any other
sign? Can I see a tree?

1816
02:00:21,619 --> 02:00:31,058
MATT: Unfortunately, the scrying location, the
actual orb that you see from is very limited in

1817
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:34,228
scope. The fact that you're able to even make out
the details that I told you are because you're

1818
02:00:34,297 --> 02:00:39,295
seeing color and images and shapes in the
distance. You get a vague idea of landscape, but

1819
02:00:39,295 --> 02:00:40,312
it's all very blurred.

1820
02:00:40,312 --> 02:00:43,572
TALIESIN: Is it giving me any sense of anywhere
I've been before?

1821
02:00:43,572 --> 02:00:49,624
MATT: You have not really traveled length and
breadth of anywhere outside of Tal'Dorei, so no.

1822
02:00:49,624 --> 02:00:55,947
What you do see, though, is on the front of the
horse, you see the same cloaked figure riding the

1823
02:00:55,947 --> 02:01:02,000
horse. Glances back over the shoulder and you can
see what appears to be a pale-skinned human woman,

1824
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:09,166
looks in her twenties or so, but same outfit. And
looks back and checks on him. He's stirring a

1825
02:01:09,166 --> 02:01:17,331
little bit, and she glances back and goes, "Be
patient. We're almost there." (hoofbeats)

1826
02:01:17,331 --> 02:01:18,882
TALIESIN: That'll do.

1827
02:01:18,882 --> 02:01:21,646
MARISHA: Am I with him in the vision?

1828
02:01:21,646 --> 02:01:26,029
MATT: No, you're watching him as his eyes glaze
over for a moment.

1829
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:28,227
TALIESIN: Well, that'll do.

1830
02:01:28,278 --> 02:01:29,603
LAURA: Where is he?

1831
02:01:29,603 --> 02:01:30,992
TALIESIN: They're taking him home.

1832
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:32,512
LAURA: Well, yes, we knew that!

1833
02:01:32,512 --> 02:01:40,099
TALIESIN: They're on horseback. They're already
quite far... I don't know precisely where they

1834
02:01:40,099 --> 02:01:44,417
are, but if we can make our way to--

1835
02:01:44,417 --> 02:01:46,118
LAURA: Wildmount.

1836
02:01:46,118 --> 02:01:48,081
LIAM: Yeah. What's our fastest method there?

1837
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:55,142
TALIESIN: They're going by horse. They'll probably
be there sooner rather than later,

1838
02:01:55,142 --> 02:01:56,148
would be my guess.

1839
02:01:56,148 --> 02:01:58,325
LAURA: You don't know where any trees are in
Wildmount?

1840
02:01:58,325 --> 02:02:05,683
MARISHA: The closest tree that we've ever been to
was the one we used to get to Draconia, but I

1841
02:02:05,683 --> 02:02:13,054
don't know how close Draconia is to him. I can try
and scry on where they are and look and see for

1842
02:02:13,054 --> 02:02:18,606
the biggest tree myself and pop out right there.

1843
02:02:18,685 --> 02:02:21,229
TALIESIN: Well, the city that Tary's from--

1844
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:22,861
MATT: Deastok.

1845
02:02:22,861 --> 02:02:29,386
TALIESIN: It would be best to go there and cut
them off. We know that they're coming from the

1846
02:02:29,386 --> 02:02:32,291
west. There's got to be a way to get there.

1847
02:02:32,291 --> 02:02:34,112
MARISHA: Can I scry on Deastok?

1848
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:39,105
MATT: You can only scry on locations that you've
seen or been to.

1849
02:02:39,105 --> 02:02:42,209
MARISHA: And people that I have connections to.

1850
02:02:42,209 --> 02:02:47,092
MATT: People you can scry on with certain levels
of knowing them or hearing about them and such.

1851
02:02:47,092 --> 02:02:48,963
TALIESIN: How far is it?

1852
02:02:48,963 --> 02:02:54,585
MATT: I'll double-check real fast because I don't
want to get a lot of anger on the internet.

1853
02:02:54,585 --> 02:02:59,170
Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a
location you have seen before

1854
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:01,214
as the target of the spell.

1855
02:03:01,214 --> 02:03:08,087
MARISHA: Instead of choosing a creature. But I
could try and scry on Tary again

1856
02:03:08,087 --> 02:03:10,012
and get a nearby tree?

1857
02:03:10,012 --> 02:03:17,873
MATT: It's only a ten-foot radius to see anything
clearly around the center, so you'd have to be

1858
02:03:17,873 --> 02:03:20,013
pretty close to a tree for you to make it out
enough.

1859
02:03:20,013 --> 02:03:24,983
MARISHA: Do we have any images or any books here
on Deastok that I can look at and then try and

1860
02:03:24,983 --> 02:03:26,725
scry on, and then after I have the knowledge?

1861
02:03:26,725 --> 02:03:31,431
LAURA: Doty's book? He might have written some
things about it.

1862
02:03:31,431 --> 02:03:35,992
LIAM: Gilmore's been many places. He might have
something from there.

1863
02:03:35,992 --> 02:03:46,489
TALIESIN: How far away is it? How far away is the
city from us? How many days on horseback?

1864
02:03:46,489 --> 02:03:56,462
MATT: Let's see. From Whitestone directly, it
would be probably about-- you can't cross the

1865
02:03:56,462 --> 02:04:00,791
channel on horseback, but if you were to start at
the other side of the Shearing Channel on

1866
02:04:00,791 --> 02:04:08,153
horseback and ride, let's say 12 hours a day, you
could probably get there in about four days. Three

1867
02:04:08,153 --> 02:04:09,856
to four days.

1868
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:12,745
TALIESIN: So if we misted...

1869
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:15,617
MARISHA: It still wouldn't be enough time.

1870
02:04:15,617 --> 02:04:17,079
LAURA: No, just bamf there.

1871
02:04:17,079 --> 02:04:18,515
MARISHA: We have to bamf there.

1872
02:04:18,515 --> 02:04:23,307
LIAM: Two days. Go to Emon, talk to Shaun. He's
been everywhere.

1873
02:04:23,307 --> 02:04:25,451
LAURA: Scry on her again!

1874
02:04:25,451 --> 02:04:30,565
TALIESIN: Draconia. How close would Draconia be to
this?

1875
02:04:30,565 --> 02:04:32,741
MARISHA: Yeah, do we know how close Draconia is?

1876
02:04:32,741 --> 02:04:47,176
MATT: The Dremoth Ravine, with the remains of
Draconia, would probably be about 150, 200 miles

1877
02:04:47,176 --> 02:04:48,276
from it.

1878
02:04:48,276 --> 02:04:50,291
TALIESIN: That's not bad. We could misty from
Draconia.

1879
02:04:50,291 --> 02:04:51,444
MARISHA: Yes, we could.

1880
02:04:51,444 --> 02:04:53,808
LAURA: Sure.

1881
02:04:53,808 --> 02:04:59,868
TALIESIN: But you can't Tree Stride today, can
you?

1882
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:03,474
LAURA: Oh, you already used it on Allura.

1883
02:05:03,474 --> 02:05:05,995
MARISHA: Is that the same day? I thought we
slept.

1884
02:05:05,995 --> 02:05:08,645
TALIESIN: No, that was the same day.

1885
02:05:08,645 --> 02:05:12,919
MATT: Well, you used it once today. You had a full
night's sleep, got all your spells back, and then

1886
02:05:12,919 --> 02:05:14,761
you sent Allura off once today.

1887
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:16,026
LAURA: So we have two.

1888
02:05:16,026 --> 02:05:23,102
MARISHA: So that was today. I could do it again,
and then I can Misty Step us, and then I would be

1889
02:05:23,102 --> 02:05:30,749
out of my 6th, 7th, and 8th-level spells. I would
be burning higher spell slots to get us there, but

1890
02:05:30,749 --> 02:05:31,924
I could do it.

1891
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:36,370
TALIESIN: We could be there-- We could be there in
hours, if need be.

1892
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:38,651
LAURA: Let's do it!

1893
02:05:38,651 --> 02:05:42,788
MARISHA: You have no books here on Deastok? None
in Whitestone?

1894
02:05:42,788 --> 02:05:44,602
LAURA: Let's look in the Doty book real fast.

1895
02:05:44,602 --> 02:05:45,632
MARISHA: Yeah.

1896
02:05:45,632 --> 02:05:48,266
MATT: Okay. There's a lot of writing in here.

1897
02:05:48,266 --> 02:05:49,995
LAURA: Towards the beginning.

1898
02:05:49,995 --> 02:05:56,780
MATT: Towards the beginning, it talks about
Deastok. It talks about the frustrations of the

1899
02:05:56,780 --> 02:06:03,189
small-town life and the open world around and all
the adventures they're seeking there. It's not

1900
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:07,905
written to show any detail or interest about the
city where he grew up.

1901
02:06:07,905 --> 02:06:13,713
MARISHA: (groans) All right, to Draconia! Let's
go!

1902
02:06:13,778 --> 02:06:16,296
TALIESIN: Gear up, everyone.

1903
02:06:16,296 --> 02:06:20,296
MARISHA: Everyone, the Uber will be here in five
minutes.

1904
02:06:20,296 --> 02:06:27,817
MATT: All right, you guys gather your materials,
make your way to the Sun Tree, and Keyleth, you

1905
02:06:27,817 --> 02:06:36,987
open Transport Via Plants to the exterior of the
Dremoth Ravine in the ruins of Draconia. And

1906
02:06:36,987 --> 02:06:38,759
that's where we'll take a break!

1907
02:06:38,759 --> 02:06:42,629
LAURA: Why can't anybody be nice?

1908
02:06:42,629 --> 02:06:50,732
TALIESIN: She was nice! She was tied up by a bad
person! She was tied up by some elfy Boba Fett.

1909
02:06:50,732 --> 02:06:58,476
She was fine.

1910
02:06:58,524 --> 02:07:01,308
MATT: Well, if you're really frustrated with how
untrustworthy this NPC is,

1911
02:07:01,378 --> 02:07:03,283
you can thank chat for it!

1912
02:07:03,283 --> 02:07:05,543
ASHLEY: Thank the chat?

1913
02:07:05,543 --> 02:07:07,177
LAURA: The chat did this to us?

1914
02:07:07,177 --> 02:07:08,484
SAM: Fuck you, chat!

1915
02:07:08,484 --> 02:07:12,696
LAURA: You turned our own bakery against us! You!

1916
02:07:12,696 --> 02:07:14,093
ASHLEY: They know.

1917
02:07:14,093 --> 02:07:18,009
TALIESIN: To be fair, carbs are never really your
friend, are they?

1918
02:07:18,009 --> 02:07:20,874
TRAVIS: They are in workouts!

1919
02:07:20,874 --> 02:07:25,681
MATT: All right. We're going to take a quick
break. Before we go, guys, we have the giveaway

1920
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:36,310
for this. This looks to be a Katalox dice tray
here, which is pretty awesome, with a leather

1921
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:44,149
interior from our good friends at Wyrmwood. We're
going to go ahead and, because I feel like I have

1922
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:51,487
to, the code for this contest in the Twitch chat
is Samsshirt, one word, with two mid-s's.

1923
02:07:51,487 --> 02:07:56,486
S-A-M-S-S-H-I-R-T. Sam's shirt.

1924
02:07:56,486 --> 02:07:57,693
TALIESIN: Sam's shirt.

1925
02:07:57,693 --> 02:07:59,953
MATT: So find your way over to the Twitch chat,
put that in there for the chance to win this

1926
02:07:59,953 --> 02:08:04,189
awesome giveaway! All right, guys. We'll see you
in a few minutes!

1927
02:08:04,189 --> 02:28:59,981
[break]

1928
02:29:00,049 --> 02:29:06,732
MATT: Hey guys, welcome back to Critical Role. We
have our winner in the chat. Tonight's winner is

1929
02:29:06,732 --> 02:29:14,037
FormaldehydeG. You win. Denova will contact you
via a whisper to get your contact and shipping

1930
02:29:14,037 --> 02:29:19,887
information, and you will get your awesome prize
of your Wyrmwood box.

1931
02:29:19,887 --> 02:29:22,342
LAURA: (mocking) Prize.

1932
02:29:22,342 --> 02:29:23,794
MATT: (Christopher Walken voice) Prize.

1933
02:29:23,794 --> 02:29:24,887
LIAM: Don't do it.

1934
02:29:24,887 --> 02:29:30,272
MATT: Oh god, I did it. I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Right. So, jumping back into the game. You guys

1935
02:29:30,272 --> 02:29:36,477
have learned of the current whereabouts of Taryon
Darrington. Proceeding in the direction of which

1936
02:29:36,477 --> 02:29:43,101
he is getting transported. Which, let's go ahead
and take a moment here, actually. Taryon, as

1937
02:29:43,167 --> 02:29:48,497
you've come to consciousness on the back of this
horse and you hear this woman, cloaked and riding

1938
02:29:48,497 --> 02:29:55,680
in front of you, tell you, "We're almost there,"
and then (hoofbeats). You're hopping around on the

1939
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:59,706
back, bound. You try and move your arms and legs, and
they're tied tightly.

1940
02:29:59,706 --> 02:30:15,867
SAM: Doty! Doty. I'm having a dream again. Doty?
Oh boy. Ugh. Hello? You there, driver person!

1941
02:30:15,867 --> 02:30:17,112
Hello?

1942
02:30:17,112 --> 02:30:23,314
MATT: The head looks back over. "Oh! You've
awakened. Isn't that very interesting?"

1943
02:30:23,472 --> 02:30:30,109
SAM: What's going on? Where are you taking me?
Have I won a lottery of some sort?

1944
02:30:30,109 --> 02:30:38,017
MATT: "You could say that, perhaps. Yes. I have a
contract to bring you back to Deastok, and I am

1945
02:30:38,017 --> 02:30:39,510
"fulfilling that contract."

1946
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:44,312
SAM: Oh no. Did my father pay you to do this?

1947
02:30:44,312 --> 02:30:49,065
MATT: "Howaardt Darrington? Because if so, yes."

1948
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:50,289
SAM: He is.

1949
02:30:50,289 --> 02:30:51,888
MATT: "Then that is where you are going."

1950
02:30:51,888 --> 02:30:55,283
SAM: I will pay you whatever he has promised you,
double, if you let me go right now.

1951
02:30:55,283 --> 02:31:02,453
MATT: She shakes her head for a second. "I've
looked through your belongings. You do not have

1952
02:31:02,453 --> 02:31:03,633
"the money you speak of."

1953
02:31:03,633 --> 02:31:07,752
SAM: I will write you a check and I will guarantee
it with the name Taryon Darrington.

1954
02:31:07,752 --> 02:31:11,861
MATT: She laughs and turns back and focuses more
on the horse riding.

1955
02:31:11,861 --> 02:31:24,414
SAM: Damn it. (sighs) Money is so good. Not when
you don't have it. I have armor. I have jewels

1956
02:31:24,414 --> 02:31:29,581
that are worth a lot. Please, you don't want to do
this. Please.

1957
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:32,496
Just let it go and no one will get hurt.

1958
02:31:32,496 --> 02:31:38,852
MATT: She turns back over her shoulder. "The money
is one thing. But another is one's reputation.

1959
02:31:38,852 --> 02:31:48,784
"When I take a contract, I fulfill it. I have not
failed. I will not fail. So you are going home.

1960
02:31:48,784 --> 02:31:52,249
"My apologies." (hoofbeats) And goes right back.

1961
02:31:52,249 --> 02:31:56,150
SAM: I respect her so much. (sighs)

1962
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:58,052
TRAVIS: (mouthing) What's her name?

1963
02:31:58,052 --> 02:32:02,693
SAM: I don't ask people names, friend. (laughs)

1964
02:32:02,693 --> 02:32:06,746
MATT: All right. So what are the rest of you guys
doing?

1965
02:32:06,746 --> 02:32:09,517
LAURA: Running around like crazy people.

1966
02:32:09,517 --> 02:32:12,606
MARISHA: We bamfed through the tree, right?

1967
02:32:12,606 --> 02:32:17,033
MATT: Right. Yep. So you gathered your elements
and you transport through one of the trees that

1968
02:32:17,033 --> 02:32:21,508
you created on the outside of the Dremoth Ravine.

1969
02:32:21,508 --> 02:32:24,757
MARISHA: That's right. We grew them a forest.

1970
02:32:24,757 --> 02:32:26,064
MATT: You did.

1971
02:32:26,064 --> 02:32:28,061
MARISHA: Oh my god. That's right.

1972
02:32:28,061 --> 02:32:31,144
LIAM: The last time we came here, we came flying
out of a tree on an angle.

1973
02:32:31,144 --> 02:32:33,417
MATT: On an angle, yeah. You do not come through
that same tree.

1974
02:32:33,417 --> 02:32:37,826
MARISHA: Off the edge of a cliff. (laughs
nervously) It's a theme.

1975
02:32:37,826 --> 02:32:39,332
MATT: Sorry.

1976
02:32:39,332 --> 02:32:48,782
LAURA: All right, so which way is Wildmount?

1977
02:32:48,782 --> 02:32:50,191
TALIESIN: Northeast?

1978
02:32:50,191 --> 02:32:53,332
MATT: From this area, it would be northeast, yes.

1979
02:32:53,332 --> 02:32:54,441
LAURA: Let's go.

1980
02:32:54,441 --> 02:32:56,769
TALIESIN: So I say we head north first. Find the
main road.

1981
02:32:56,769 --> 02:33:01,100
MATT: You're on Wildmount the continent, but
you're heading more towards the city of Deastok,

1982
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:05,303
which is on the outskirts of the Dwendalian
Empire.

1983
02:33:05,303 --> 02:33:11,740
TALIESIN: We did know that they were on a road
headed west. Heading east. Which means if we head

1984
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:16,245
north and then the minute that we hit that main
road start heading in that direction, we might

1985
02:33:16,245 --> 02:33:19,365
even pass them on the way and be able to identify
a horse.

1986
02:33:19,365 --> 02:33:22,011
LAURA: Especially if we're in like fart form.

1987
02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:25,989
MATT: All right, so you guys are going into your
Wind Walk form?

1988
02:33:25,989 --> 02:33:31,455
LIAM: Before we do. Percy, do you know anything
about this country we're in? Anything?

1989
02:33:31,455 --> 02:33:34,509
MATT: Make a history check.

1990
02:33:34,509 --> 02:33:43,543
TALIESIN: Not really my area of expertise, but 22.
History check, correct?

1991
02:33:43,543 --> 02:33:44,367
MATT: Yes.

1992
02:33:44,367 --> 02:33:45,239
TALIESIN: 22.

1993
02:33:45,239 --> 02:33:54,409
MATT: This area of Wildmount known as Wynandir is
divided into two different kingdoms, essentially.

1994
02:33:54,409 --> 02:33:59,623
This one you're going towards is called the
Dwendalian Empire. This is the strongest and the

1995
02:33:59,623 --> 02:34:09,153
most functional empire this side of Exandria. It
is a tyranny. There is a king, and the law is

1996
02:34:09,153 --> 02:34:16,805
ruled absolutely through this king. It is a
functional economy. Its people aren't mistreated,

1997
02:34:16,805 --> 02:34:31,051
from what you've read, though it is-- I want to
say, it's very Prussian. People work, people live,

1998
02:34:31,051 --> 02:34:32,352
people die.

1999
02:34:32,352 --> 02:34:36,000
LAURA: Harsh?

2000
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:46,137
MATT: It's a harsh environment. It's a colder
environment. Whereas the center of Tal'Dorei is a

2001
02:34:46,137 --> 02:34:52,844
lot of fields and rolling hills across the
midsection framed by mountains, across Wildmount,

2002
02:34:52,844 --> 02:34:58,768
it is a smattering of mountain ranges and spires
throughout, and chunks of forest. It is a much

2003
02:34:58,768 --> 02:35:06,444
harsher environment, as far as the topography and
the biomes than Tal'Dorei, and as such, the

2004
02:35:06,444 --> 02:35:11,610
pockets where people do live, they live as well as
they can amongst a very oppressive environment.

2005
02:35:11,610 --> 02:35:14,017
TALIESIN: What's the name of the city, one more
time?

2006
02:35:14,017 --> 02:35:15,098
MATT: Deastok.

2007
02:35:15,098 --> 02:35:18,094
MARISHA: Oh, this is Deastok. Okay.

2008
02:35:18,094 --> 02:35:20,286
TALIESIN: Deastok. So it's a bit Prussian?

2009
02:35:20,286 --> 02:35:21,387
MATT: Yeah.

2010
02:35:21,387 --> 02:35:34,591
TALIESIN: Okay. That will do. So don't expect a
lot of hospitality, and let's just have our

2011
02:35:34,591 --> 02:35:36,578
business, get it done, and get out.

2012
02:35:36,578 --> 02:35:43,157
LIAM: Also, we can't talk when we're farts, so
when we get there, what's the plan, plan man?

2013
02:35:43,157 --> 02:35:46,425
TALIESIN: We're going to fly up until we see the
main road. We see the main road, we're going to

2014
02:35:46,425 --> 02:35:54,888
take it towards the city. We're going to stay a
bit high. If anyone spots a lone horse and a rider

2015
02:35:54,888 --> 02:36:00,739
with a human-sized package on the back, we're
going to do a little spin-around, spin-around,

2016
02:36:00,739 --> 02:36:05,051
spin-around, and we're all going to park ourselves
maybe a quarter of a mile up the road.

2017
02:36:05,051 --> 02:36:07,841
ASHLEY: I like that idea.

2018
02:36:07,841 --> 02:36:16,490
LIAM: What happens if we don't see the person on
the horse? What happens? We just land right

2019
02:36:16,490 --> 02:36:18,707
outside the gates and ring the bell?

2020
02:36:18,707 --> 02:36:20,125
TALIESIN: We land inside the gates.

2021
02:36:20,125 --> 02:36:25,585
LIAM: Okay, but that seems a little dicey if we
want to work out what we're going to do. We're

2022
02:36:25,585 --> 02:36:27,473
just going to appear and say howdy?

2023
02:36:27,473 --> 02:36:31,959
TALIESIN: From what I know of this city, it's not
a locked city, is it?

2024
02:36:31,959 --> 02:36:37,906
MATT: It's not a locked city. There are perimeter
walls and there are gates that can close in case

2025
02:36:37,906 --> 02:36:46,351
of times of war. You do know that there is a
strong military presence in most cities and there

2026
02:36:46,351 --> 02:36:49,795
are patrols that often make sure that peace is
kept.

2027
02:36:49,795 --> 02:36:55,260
TALIESIN: So we can walk in if we need to, but
let's not make any waves unless we need to.

2028
02:36:55,260 --> 02:37:02,365
MATT: It's a somewhat militaristic nation. It's
to the point where you don't know, or at least

2029
02:37:02,412 --> 02:37:06,980
have not heard, of any widespread abuses of power.
At least, not on the outskirt cities. You don't

2030
02:37:06,980 --> 02:37:10,973
know that much about the political structure
there, other than the fact that it is a tyranny.

2031
02:37:10,973 --> 02:37:18,824
But it has a strong standing military and they do
exercise it in times of peace as a form of law

2032
02:37:18,824 --> 02:37:20,124
enforcement.

2033
02:37:20,124 --> 02:37:25,920
LIAM: You and Tary are thick as thieves, now. How
plugged in is his dad?

2034
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:36,073
LAURA: Super. Right? I mean, he's not the most
powerful guy, but he does well for himself. He

2035
02:37:36,073 --> 02:37:37,369
runs an area.

2036
02:37:37,369 --> 02:37:45,175
MATT: The way Taryon talks about his father is he
is a land baron in Deastok. He owns a number of

2037
02:37:45,175 --> 02:37:56,742
plots and homes and farms and collects taxes on
them. His family has been doing this for at least

2038
02:37:56,804 --> 02:37:59,918
a generation or two and has made quite a fortune
off of it.

2039
02:37:59,918 --> 02:38:01,801
LAURA: And his sister's name is?

2040
02:38:01,801 --> 02:38:03,153
MATT: His sister's name is Maryanne.

2041
02:38:03,153 --> 02:38:09,641
LAURA: Maryanne. That's creative. Okay. All
right.

2042
02:38:09,641 --> 02:38:13,164
LIAM: Yes, Maryanne Darrington.

2043
02:38:13,164 --> 02:38:17,763
LAURA: And his mom is Mariya. (laughs) All right.

2044
02:38:17,824 --> 02:38:20,876
TRAVIS: Mariya and Howaardt?

2045
02:38:20,876 --> 02:38:24,249
LAURA: Mariya and Howaardt Darrington.

2046
02:38:24,249 --> 02:38:25,283
MATT: Yes.

2047
02:38:25,283 --> 02:38:27,114
LIAM: All right.

2048
02:38:27,114 --> 02:38:30,834
LAURA: See, I know his mother's name!

2049
02:38:30,834 --> 02:38:46,320
MATT: All right. Do you go ahead and accept
Keyleth's Wind Walk? All right. With a moment of

2050
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:55,861
concentration, you all convert yourselves into
plumes of smoke, mist. By the way, did you leave

2051
02:38:55,861 --> 02:38:58,023
Doty behind or take Doty with you?

2052
02:38:58,023 --> 02:39:00,496
MARISHA: We can't take him with us.

2053
02:39:00,496 --> 02:39:03,282
MATT: Yeah. Okay, then. Doty is back in
Whitestone.

2054
02:39:03,282 --> 02:39:05,180
LAURA: I mean, yeah, he doesn't respond to us.

2055
02:39:05,180 --> 02:39:09,261
MARISHA: I mean, we would have had to have had--

2056
02:39:09,261 --> 02:39:11,193
TRAVIS: Just say no.

2057
02:39:11,193 --> 02:39:12,703
MARISHA: No, we didn't.

2058
02:39:12,703 --> 02:39:21,497
MATT: I was just reconfirming. All right, then.
So, you guys convert to your--

2059
02:39:21,497 --> 02:39:26,287
LAURA: I can't put him in the necklace! He won't
go in the necklace! I tried before.

2060
02:39:26,287 --> 02:39:27,345
He doesn't go.

2061
02:39:27,345 --> 02:39:28,652
LIAM: Who are you talking to?

2062
02:39:28,652 --> 02:39:41,088
MATT: You all coast in the shapes of mist into the
moist, freezing air over the Dremoth Ravine and

2063
02:39:41,088 --> 02:39:48,099
head northward. You guys move as a cluster of
small plumes of moisture. As you look forward over

2064
02:39:48,099 --> 02:39:52,169
the next-- 300 feet a round, at double speed--

2065
02:39:52,169 --> 02:39:54,521
LAURA: Carry the three.

2066
02:39:54,521 --> 02:39:55,855
MATT: Yeah.

2067
02:39:55,855 --> 02:40:00,534
TALIESIN: Doing air math; it's great. Nothing
quite like air math.

2068
02:40:00,534 --> 02:40:06,235
MATT: Once again, this is twice in an episode
where it's magical-fantasy-realm physics.

2069
02:40:06,235 --> 02:40:19,006
Somewhere in the middle, you find a fun narrative.
I'd say within probably an hour and a half to two

2070
02:40:19,006 --> 02:40:24,621
hours of travel, because you guys are going pretty
fast, you eventually come upon a very well-ridden

2071
02:40:24,621 --> 02:40:35,385
and apparent pathway that goes from east to west.
The topography does seem at least to be somewhat

2072
02:40:35,385 --> 02:40:41,699
in line with what you saw the brief time that you
scryed upon Taryon.

2073
02:40:41,699 --> 02:40:47,129
TALIESIN: I'm just heading the direction--

2074
02:40:47,129 --> 02:40:49,247
LAURA: That smoke plume definitely--

2075
02:40:49,247 --> 02:40:51,862
ASHLEY: That smoke plume knows where it's going.

2076
02:40:51,862 --> 02:40:53,263
TALIESIN: I can't hear you.

2077
02:40:53,263 --> 02:40:56,276
MATT: So you guys all continue heading east.

2078
02:40:56,276 --> 02:41:01,327
LAURA: Do we have normal mental thoughts when
we're smoke plumes? Or do we just think in terms

2079
02:41:01,327 --> 02:41:02,786
of (wind noises)?

2080
02:41:02,786 --> 02:41:10,059
MATT: No, you think normally. You're still
mentally you. You just can't talk. If you do talk,

2081
02:41:10,059 --> 02:41:12,691
it comes out as (blows raspberry).

2082
02:41:12,691 --> 02:41:14,516
LIAM: (blows raspberry)

2083
02:41:14,516 --> 02:41:15,994
MATT: There you go.

2084
02:41:15,994 --> 02:41:17,987
LAURA: What does it sound like if you laugh?

2085
02:41:17,987 --> 02:41:22,747
LIAM and TALIESIN: (airy laughter)

2086
02:41:22,747 --> 02:41:24,138
LAURA: Sorry. We're going.

2087
02:41:24,138 --> 02:41:28,012
MATT: As you guys continue pushing east...

2088
02:41:28,012 --> 02:41:34,004
TALIESIN: I'm going to be keeping an eye out for
anybody on the road.

2089
02:41:34,004 --> 02:41:35,478
LAURA: Ditto.

2090
02:41:35,478 --> 02:41:39,694
MATT: Perception check from the two of you guys.

2091
02:41:39,694 --> 02:41:44,216
TALIESIN: 12.

2092
02:41:44,216 --> 02:41:45,565
LAURA: 22.

2093
02:41:45,565 --> 02:41:53,565
MATT: Okay. You see what looks to be one small
caravan, a series of carts that are heading west

2094
02:41:53,565 --> 02:42:01,531
along the path. That's the only thing that you see
at the moment. You, Vex, after a couple more hours

2095
02:42:01,531 --> 02:42:12,108
of travel in an eastern direction you see what
looks to be a big, thick forest. The forest itself

2096
02:42:12,108 --> 02:42:15,795
is pretty dense in this area, and there are
pockets where it's open and you get a little more

2097
02:42:15,795 --> 02:42:19,346
of a green field. You've been traveling over a
larger green field area, so you start hitting

2098
02:42:19,346 --> 02:42:24,159
where the forest gets thicker and thicker. The
pathway carves through this forest. Then a ways

2099
02:42:24,159 --> 02:42:29,174
ahead, you see what appears to be a large hill
that rises up, and then around the hill, the

2100
02:42:29,174 --> 02:42:34,261
forest has been cleared and you can see what
amounts to acres and acres and acres of farmland

2101
02:42:34,261 --> 02:42:40,489
that circles almost like a disk around this large
central hill. The top of the hill is cleared off,

2102
02:42:40,489 --> 02:42:50,453
and there you can see what appears to be a
metropolitan city. A large town, if you will. You

2103
02:42:50,453 --> 02:42:57,669
can see what appear to be-- actually, no. You're
not quite close enough. So that's what you see.

2104
02:42:57,669 --> 02:43:03,074
You see this village on top of this cleared hill
surrounded by farmland and then surrounded by

2105
02:43:03,074 --> 02:43:07,498
forest and what appear to be some broken mountain
ranges maybe a few miles out each direction.

2106
02:43:07,498 --> 02:43:11,907
TALIESIN: I keep skirting around, looking for a
lone horseman.

2107
02:43:11,907 --> 02:43:13,294
MATT: Okay.

2108
02:43:13,294 --> 02:43:16,575
LAURA: Can I fly down and see if I see any signs
along the road?

2109
02:43:16,575 --> 02:43:18,478
Any markers saying what city it is?

2110
02:43:18,478 --> 02:43:26,700
MATT: Okay. You cruise down and begin riding a
little closer to the surface. With your general,

2111
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:31,954
even passive perception, you do catch what appears
to be-- there are a few splinter trails that seem

2112
02:43:31,954 --> 02:43:37,710
to be the perimeter on the outside of where the
forest leads inward and heads along the outskirts

2113
02:43:37,710 --> 02:43:48,560
of the tree line. There you do see a sign. The
arrow leads forward towards what is called the

2114
02:43:48,560 --> 02:44:00,024
Siren Green Forest, and then eastward towards
Deastok. You gather that the large town on this

2115
02:44:00,024 --> 02:44:04,849
carved hilltop seems to be the town in question.

2116
02:44:04,849 --> 02:44:08,553
LAURA: But nobody on horseback?

2117
02:44:08,553 --> 02:44:11,702
MATT: You don't see anybody on horseback at the
moment, no.

2118
02:44:11,702 --> 02:44:15,782
TALIESIN: (hiccups)

2119
02:44:15,782 --> 02:44:19,499
TRAVIS: (laughing) Is that the cloud hiccups?

2120
02:44:19,499 --> 02:44:24,162
TALIESIN: I'm going to scout around a little
closer to the ground and see if there's anybody.

2121
02:44:24,162 --> 02:44:29,016
Maybe any of the paths off the main road where
someone might be hiding and just run through the

2122
02:44:29,016 --> 02:44:34,120
trees looking for anything. I'm searching around a
little bit. I know we're close to the city, and

2123
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:39,485
I'm keeping an aerial view because we should be
able to see an awful lot from high up.

2124
02:44:39,485 --> 02:44:46,758
MATT: You do. You see hundreds of acres of
farmland that surround this large hill. It's built

2125
02:44:46,758 --> 02:44:51,236
all across the top of the hill then built along
the front side of it. You can see a number of

2126
02:44:51,236 --> 02:44:58,928
paths that zigzag down. Elements of it sprawl a
bit into the farm, but the majority of the

2127
02:44:58,928 --> 02:45:04,427
metropolis is on top of the hill itself, and then
the farmland around it. You do see, as you get

2128
02:45:04,427 --> 02:45:10,764
closer and skirt the sides, there are patrols. You
see men on horseback with crossbows slung over the

2129
02:45:10,764 --> 02:45:16,189
side that do perimeters. Some of them are weaving
independently through the fields, keeping an eye

2130
02:45:16,189 --> 02:45:19,213
on people who are in the process of harvesting.

2131
02:45:19,213 --> 02:45:21,850
TALIESIN: No interest of getting anywhere near
that.

2132
02:45:21,850 --> 02:45:27,180
MATT: The rest of you guys continue heading east
towards the town, or are you following?

2133
02:45:27,201 --> 02:45:30,200
TALIESIN: I'm popping back on the road.

2134
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:31,940
MATT: Okay. Percival catches up to you guys.

2135
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:44,764
LAURA: At this point, I feel like our option is
only to go towards the house, if we can find his

2136
02:45:44,764 --> 02:45:46,036
family's keep.

2137
02:45:46,036 --> 02:45:47,483
TRAVIS: Did we beat him here?

2138
02:45:47,483 --> 02:45:49,759
LAURA: I don't know. There's no way to know.

2139
02:45:49,759 --> 02:45:51,660
TALIESIN: We can land and have a conversation.

2140
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:52,741
LAURA: Yeah.

2141
02:45:52,741 --> 02:45:58,330
MATT: Okay. So you guys (whoosh) make your way to
the-- where do you want to land?

2142
02:45:58,330 --> 02:46:02,048
LAURA: Maybe the edge of town, into the Siren Gate
Forest.

2143
02:46:02,048 --> 02:46:06,736
MATT: Okay. So you find the edge of the tree line
before it opens up into the farmland surrounding

2144
02:46:06,736 --> 02:46:11,223
the city. As you all take a moment to concentrate,
your forms congeal once more into your physical

2145
02:46:11,223 --> 02:46:13,964
selves and you are able to discuss as you prefer.

2146
02:46:13,964 --> 02:46:16,468
LAURA: Well! Anybody see anything?

2147
02:46:16,468 --> 02:46:21,459
ASHLEY: Is it possible she could've put some kind
of covering over them?

2148
02:46:21,459 --> 02:46:26,321
LAURA: Like we did with Whitestone or something?

2149
02:46:26,321 --> 02:46:27,260
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2150
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:27,992
TALIESIN: Yes.

2151
02:46:27,992 --> 02:46:29,570
LIAM: Many things are possible, though.

2152
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:35,048
MARISHA: Can we still see their tracks if we went
back and looked? That would be a ranger question.

2153
02:46:35,048 --> 02:46:46,477
LAURA: I mean, it's just horse tracks, but I can
look. Horse tracks on a main road. Unless Tary is

2154
02:46:46,477 --> 02:46:50,484
thinking and he's leaving something behind so that
we can track him.

2155
02:46:50,484 --> 02:46:53,193
TALIESIN: Tary, can you hear us?

2156
02:46:53,193 --> 02:46:57,371
LAURA: Tary? Good idea, Percy!

2157
02:46:57,371 --> 02:46:59,026
MATT: Nothing at the moment.

2158
02:46:59,026 --> 02:47:00,995
LIAM: Have to be within 500 feet.

2159
02:47:00,995 --> 02:47:05,860
MARISHA: I could try Commune With Nature, but it
only extends for a few miles.

2160
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:11,132
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate-- oh, should I do
that? Should I waste it right now?

2161
02:47:11,132 --> 02:47:12,701
MARISHA: How long does it last?

2162
02:47:12,701 --> 02:47:18,465
LAURA: Ten minutes. I'm going to try. Wait, a
thousand feet. That's not very far, compared to

2163
02:47:18,465 --> 02:47:19,503
where the city is.

2164
02:47:19,503 --> 02:47:20,638
TRAVIS: A few miles is better.

2165
02:47:20,638 --> 02:47:24,839
MARISHA: Plus, that's a concentration spell. The
mist form is my concentration spell, so we should

2166
02:47:24,839 --> 02:47:29,717
be able to do both at once, correct? If we move
quickly while she has her Locate Object on?

2167
02:47:29,717 --> 02:47:30,790
MATT: Yeah.

2168
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:32,414
LAURA: Okay. Let's do that.

2169
02:47:32,414 --> 02:47:33,415
TALIESIN: All right!

2170
02:47:33,415 --> 02:47:41,497
LAURA: I'm going to try to locate his dangly
earring.

2171
02:47:41,497 --> 02:47:43,506
ASHLEY: Dangly bits.

2172
02:47:43,506 --> 02:47:45,167
TALIESIN: His dangly bit.

2173
02:47:45,167 --> 02:47:48,505
LAURA: His penis!

2174
02:47:48,505 --> 02:47:51,630
ASHLEY, TRAVIS, and MARISHA: Penis!

2175
02:47:51,630 --> 02:47:53,510
TALIESIN: His Tary.

2176
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:55,133
MARISHA: (giggling) His Tary!

2177
02:47:55,133 --> 02:47:57,277
LIAM: Going down to Tary-town.

2178
02:47:57,277 --> 02:48:03,217
SAM: Matt's doing something.

2179
02:48:03,217 --> 02:48:04,573
LAURA: I know, it's something.

2180
02:48:04,573 --> 02:48:10,669
MATT: Okay. I was making sure the Wind Walk
wouldn't affect any concentrations.

2181
02:48:10,669 --> 02:48:12,498
TRAVIS: He's doing trigonometry.

2182
02:48:12,498 --> 02:48:14,241
TALIESIN: Squaring his hypotenuse.

2183
02:48:14,241 --> 02:48:19,332
MATT: And you're attempting Locate Object on
Taryon's earring, you said?

2184
02:48:19,332 --> 02:48:20,382
LAURA: Yes.

2185
02:48:20,382 --> 02:48:21,475
MATT: Okay.

2186
02:48:21,475 --> 02:48:22,565
TALIESIN: His dangly bit.

2187
02:48:22,565 --> 02:48:27,247
MATT: You focus and concentrate. It does not pick
up within a thousand feet of you.

2188
02:48:27,247 --> 02:48:32,295
LAURA: Okay. So we're going to misty form towards
the city and see if we can...

2189
02:48:32,295 --> 02:48:33,540
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2190
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:40,392
MATT: Okay. (whoosh) You all head back up into the
sky, and you can see now the clouds in this

2191
02:48:40,392 --> 02:48:42,968
vicinity are growing darker. It looks like it's
probably going to rain

2192
02:48:42,968 --> 02:48:44,373
in the next few hours or so.

2193
02:48:44,373 --> 02:48:46,902
LAURA: Okay. So we're less noticeable?

2194
02:48:46,902 --> 02:48:53,029
MATT: The temperature right now means it might
even sleet; you're not sure. You make your way,

2195
02:48:53,029 --> 02:48:59,427
coasting over the farmland. Looking down, you can
see it's all segmented and all marked off with

2196
02:48:59,427 --> 02:49:05,128
various colored fences. Everything is really
well-organized here, and all the land has been

2197
02:49:05,128 --> 02:49:12,652
divided. You eventually make your way towards the
base of the hill and cruise up to the outskirts of

2198
02:49:12,652 --> 02:49:18,321
the city, where you see the large stone walls that
encircle elements of the outskirts, and you see

2199
02:49:18,321 --> 02:49:25,126
where each one of these walls opens up to some
sort of a pathway. There is a large metallic gate

2200
02:49:25,126 --> 02:49:29,899
that is currently separated and lifted up in the
back that can be slammed and closed and shut in

2201
02:49:29,899 --> 02:49:32,120
case you need to keep anybody in or out.

2202
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:34,044
LAURA: Ping!

2203
02:49:34,044 --> 02:49:38,405
MATT: You're getting no ping yet.

2204
02:49:38,405 --> 02:49:40,730
LAURA: No pings? Okay.

2205
02:49:40,730 --> 02:49:51,961
MATT: You guys are now over the wall now, these
six plumes of mist coasting above.

2206
02:49:51,961 --> 02:49:53,298
What do you do?

2207
02:49:53,298 --> 02:49:54,833
MARISHA: Do we backtrack?

2208
02:49:54,833 --> 02:49:58,714
LAURA: We're over his family's keep?

2209
02:49:58,714 --> 02:50:00,882
MATT: You don't know what his family's keep looks
like.

2210
02:50:00,882 --> 02:50:03,292
MARISHA: But we're over the city.

2211
02:50:03,292 --> 02:50:05,111
MATT: You're over the city right now, yeah.

2212
02:50:05,111 --> 02:50:07,766
MARISHA: So we theoretically haven't intercepted
them yet.

2213
02:50:07,766 --> 02:50:08,830
MATT: No.

2214
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:14,077
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and motion everyone to
follow me in a circle around the city and then

2215
02:50:14,077 --> 02:50:15,414
back out the front gate.

2216
02:50:15,414 --> 02:50:16,530
LAURA: Okay.

2217
02:50:16,530 --> 02:50:22,463
MATT: Okay. You move pretty fast. It's a big
radius to go around the entire wall perimeter of

2218
02:50:22,463 --> 02:50:30,985
the city. At your full speed, I'd say you can do a
full pass in about 15 minutes or so. That's a

2219
02:50:30,985 --> 02:50:34,170
careful cruising through. Nothing seems to ping.

2220
02:50:34,170 --> 02:50:37,651
LAURA: I think we beat him. Maybe we beat him.

2221
02:50:37,651 --> 02:50:41,023
SAM: Oh Matt, I forgot to tell you. When I left
home, I left a large eternal flame burning on my

2222
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:43,035
keep's roof. Is that okay?

2223
02:50:43,035 --> 02:50:50,683
MATT: Oh, right! Good to clarify! No. All right.
So.

2224
02:50:50,683 --> 02:50:55,722
TALIESIN: I don't know. Maybe we beat her. I'm
going to try and motion everyone--

2225
02:50:55,722 --> 02:50:57,536
LAURA: Back out to the fucking woods?

2226
02:50:57,536 --> 02:50:59,705
TALIESIN: Just a little. Not far.

2227
02:50:59,705 --> 02:51:02,145
MATT: Back out to the woods? Okay.

2228
02:51:02,145 --> 02:51:07,897
TALIESIN: Back onto the road. And off the road so
that we're not super visible.

2229
02:51:07,897 --> 02:51:11,988
MATT: So you're heading back over the farmland,
back to the outskirts of the Siren Gate Forest

2230
02:51:11,988 --> 02:51:14,140
into the tree line?

2231
02:51:14,205 --> 02:51:17,919
TALIESIN: About an hour's walk to the city is
where I want to put us.

2232
02:51:17,919 --> 02:51:20,475
LIAM: To where we can see the city and see the
road coming to it.

2233
02:51:20,475 --> 02:51:23,769
MATT: All right, cool. So you guys find your way
there. You wait for a moment to make sure the

2234
02:51:23,769 --> 02:51:26,823
patrols aren't anywhere nearby, and you turn back
into your physical selves.

2235
02:51:26,823 --> 02:51:32,247
TALIESIN: Well, we've either beat them here or
she's really clever.

2236
02:51:32,296 --> 02:51:35,239
LAURA: Or she took off all of his clothing and
he's riding around naked.

2237
02:51:35,239 --> 02:51:40,494
MARISHA: But she would still theoretically have
his clothing. It would still exist.

2238
02:51:40,494 --> 02:51:42,077
LAURA: Yeah, hopefully.

2239
02:51:42,148 --> 02:51:48,282
LIAM: What do you think, you think we should camp
out here for a while and keep an eye on the road

2240
02:51:48,282 --> 02:51:52,731
for a day or two? See if we can intercept? And if
they never show up, then we need to figure out

2241
02:51:52,731 --> 02:51:54,841
going into the city.

2242
02:51:54,841 --> 02:51:58,291
TALIESIN: Do we have a way of scrying one more
time before the day is up?

2243
02:51:58,291 --> 02:51:59,381
MARISHA: I do!

2244
02:51:59,381 --> 02:52:01,931
LAURA: Okay, then let's scry one more time and see
if we beat them.

2245
02:52:01,931 --> 02:52:05,242
MARISHA: I can do one of two things. I can either
scry on them, or I can do a

2246
02:52:05,242 --> 02:52:06,981
Commune With Nature spell.

2247
02:52:06,981 --> 02:52:08,165
LAURA: Scry!

2248
02:52:08,165 --> 02:52:09,774
MARISHA: All right. Scry!

2249
02:52:09,774 --> 02:52:17,939
MATT: All right. Your vision shifts once more to
Taryon, who uncomfortably, like "Ow, ow, ow" on

2250
02:52:17,939 --> 02:52:23,687
the back of this horse a little bit, and as you
start audibly making a pained sound, a hand grabs

2251
02:52:23,687 --> 02:52:28,144
the back of where the ropes are entwined and
shifts you in the back of the seat to be a little

2252
02:52:28,144 --> 02:52:29,246
more comfortable.

2253
02:52:29,246 --> 02:52:30,713
SAM: Oh, thank you!

2254
02:52:30,713 --> 02:52:37,298
MATT: No response from her. Still riding on the back
of the horse. It's getting darker now, and you can

2255
02:52:37,353 --> 02:52:45,141
see the clouds are still a little pushing towards
that stormy look that you saw when you were in the

2256
02:52:45,141 --> 02:52:47,495
city. So they're still on the road. They're still
traveling.

2257
02:52:47,495 --> 02:52:50,355
TALIESIN: But it's the road that we've...

2258
02:52:50,355 --> 02:52:53,225
MATT: Seems familiar.

2259
02:52:53,225 --> 02:52:55,606
MARISHA: Is the sun in the same direction that
we're heading?

2260
02:52:55,606 --> 02:52:58,985
MATT: Yes. The sun's more westward at this point.

2261
02:52:58,985 --> 02:53:00,088
MARISHA: Okay.

2262
02:53:00,088 --> 02:53:06,076
TALIESIN: So we could, in theory, mist low to the
ground on this road in that direction, and in

2263
02:53:06,076 --> 02:53:07,457
theory catch up with them.

2264
02:53:07,457 --> 02:53:11,393
MARISHA: And he's conscious. Which is good. He's
still alive.

2265
02:53:11,393 --> 02:53:13,117
LAURA: And he has his clothing on.

2266
02:53:13,117 --> 02:53:14,209
MARISHA: Yeah!

2267
02:53:14,209 --> 02:53:15,735
LAURA: Good. That's good.

2268
02:53:15,735 --> 02:53:17,122
MARISHA: We won't see his dangling bits.

2269
02:53:17,122 --> 02:53:18,154
TALIESIN: Just the one.

2270
02:53:18,154 --> 02:53:19,183
MARISHA: Just the one.

2271
02:53:19,183 --> 02:53:21,117
ASHLEY: Should we mist that way?

2272
02:53:21,117 --> 02:53:22,569
TALIESIN: I say we mist that way.

2273
02:53:22,569 --> 02:53:23,815
LIAM: And intercept him.

2274
02:53:23,815 --> 02:53:24,852
ASHLEY: I like that idea.

2275
02:53:24,852 --> 02:53:26,013
LAURA: Yeah, let's intercept them.

2276
02:53:26,013 --> 02:53:30,788
MATT: Okay. So you guys go back into mist form
(whoosh) and begin coasting westward along the

2277
02:53:30,788 --> 02:53:38,184
path. You travel for about ten minutes before Vex
and Vax, you pick up what looks to be a small dark

2278
02:53:38,184 --> 02:53:40,471
shape on the road.

2279
02:53:40,471 --> 02:53:43,610
LIAM and LAURA: (whoosh)

2280
02:53:43,610 --> 02:53:47,431
MATT: Okay, so what do you do?

2281
02:53:47,431 --> 02:53:49,777
LAURA: We're trying to signal everyone!

2282
02:53:49,777 --> 02:53:53,509
LIAM: Is there forest on the sides of the road
from where we are?

2283
02:53:53,509 --> 02:53:56,934
MATT: No, you traveled away from the forest now.
You're in open fields.

2284
02:53:56,934 --> 02:53:59,546
LIAM: So open fields and roads. Shite. Okay.

2285
02:53:59,546 --> 02:54:03,496
LAURA: Oh! But wait! Turn back into-- wait--

2286
02:54:03,496 --> 02:54:06,938
MATT: You can't talk.

2287
02:54:06,938 --> 02:54:09,119
LAURA: I turn back into a thing!

2288
02:54:09,119 --> 02:54:11,896
MATT: So you go and land. Vex lands and takes a
minute to concentrate and

2289
02:54:11,896 --> 02:54:13,362
go back to her physical form.

2290
02:54:13,362 --> 02:54:21,106
LAURA: They're up ahead! Maybe we should just bamf
here, be solid. I can disguise the landscape and

2291
02:54:21,106 --> 02:54:22,295
we can ambush her!

2292
02:54:22,295 --> 02:54:23,541
TALIESIN: All right.

2293
02:54:23,541 --> 02:54:25,263
LAURA: So I do that.

2294
02:54:25,263 --> 02:54:27,117
TRAVIS: Should we set a fallback?

2295
02:54:27,117 --> 02:54:33,562
MARISHA: You guys, does this make us highway
bandits? Are we highway bandits?

2296
02:54:33,562 --> 02:54:35,667
LAURA: As she's saying that, I start using--

2297
02:54:35,667 --> 02:54:40,056
MATT: You have about a minute until she gets to
you right now, by the way. You're able to see the

2298
02:54:40,056 --> 02:54:47,106
horse traveling a little above the road, so
they're almost upon you.

2299
02:54:47,106 --> 02:54:50,304
LAURA: Oh god. What do we do? She knows all of
us.

2300
02:54:50,304 --> 02:54:58,541
TALIESIN: I'm going to start making my way a
decent distance and running a little bit off the

2301
02:54:58,541 --> 02:55:03,970
road, I'm going to try and find some cover and get
ready to injure a horse.

2302
02:55:03,970 --> 02:55:06,306
LAURA: Who wants to stand in the middle of the
road?

2303
02:55:06,306 --> 02:55:09,923
LIAM: And what's on the sides of the road? Is it
tall grass, bald?

2304
02:55:09,923 --> 02:55:15,356
MATT: It's maybe knee-high grass with sections of
bald. The landscape here, outside of the farmland

2305
02:55:15,356 --> 02:55:23,877
and the forest that you can see, looks a little
hard and badlands-ish. Scrubland.

2306
02:55:24,049 --> 02:55:29,627
TRAVIS: I'm going to go 200, 300 yards back
towards the city, just in case

2307
02:55:29,627 --> 02:55:31,285
they manage to get through.

2308
02:55:31,285 --> 02:55:35,497
MATT: Okay. So you're getting down, you're doing
that...

2309
02:55:35,497 --> 02:55:39,269
LIAM: I'm going to get into some grass, as close
to the road as I can.

2310
02:55:39,269 --> 02:55:43,672
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out! And we get in the grass
and stealth.

2311
02:55:43,672 --> 02:55:47,386
MATT: Okay. Roll a stealth check. Disadvantage for
Trinket.

2312
02:55:47,386 --> 02:55:48,975
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace!

2313
02:55:48,975 --> 02:55:51,079
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

2314
02:55:51,079 --> 02:55:54,335
LAURA: Natural 20!

2315
02:55:54,335 --> 02:55:57,945
MATT: Nice. And for Trinket, with disadvantage
because he's a big bear.

2316
02:55:57,945 --> 02:55:59,234
LIAM: Oh that's a good one.

2317
02:55:59,234 --> 02:56:03,416
LAURA: Oh, he got a 19, which is a crit for him!
That sucks. 19!

2318
02:56:03,416 --> 02:56:05,781
MATT: Well, it's not a crit. That's only on
attacks.

2319
02:56:05,781 --> 02:56:06,979
LAURA: Oh. Well, still.

2320
02:56:06,979 --> 02:56:09,423
ASHLEY: It's a critical stealth!

2321
02:56:09,423 --> 02:56:13,351
MATT: All righty.

2322
02:56:13,351 --> 02:56:15,489
LAURA: Plus ten!

2323
02:56:15,489 --> 02:56:18,461
MARISHA: Oh wait, did you want someone in the
middle of the road?

2324
02:56:18,461 --> 02:56:20,413
ASHLEY: I'll stand in the middle of the road.

2325
02:56:20,413 --> 02:56:21,729
TRAVIS: Unassuming.

2326
02:56:21,729 --> 02:56:28,218
MARISHA: Unassuming, okay. I'm going to go into
crow form. (caws)

2327
02:56:28,218 --> 02:56:32,407
ASHLEY: Maybe I can act like I'm an old woman
trying to cross the road.

2328
02:56:32,407 --> 02:56:36,582
MATT: So you go into crow form.

2329
02:56:36,582 --> 02:56:39,279
MARISHA: I'm going to aid to her bird lady
aesthetic.

2330
02:56:39,279 --> 02:56:40,782
MATT: Stealth roll, Percy?

2331
02:56:40,782 --> 02:56:42,413
TALIESIN: Stealth roll?

2332
02:56:42,413 --> 02:56:44,390
MATT: And stealth roll for you, too, Vax.

2333
02:56:44,390 --> 02:56:45,350
LIAM: 37.

2334
02:56:45,350 --> 02:56:47,019
TRAVIS: Do drows have magic sight or anything?

2335
02:56:47,019 --> 02:56:48,051
LAURA: I don't know!

2336
02:56:48,051 --> 02:56:49,414
LIAM: It's a reliable talent, in fact.

2337
02:56:49,414 --> 02:56:52,014
TALIESIN: Stealth roll is-- oh that's not bad.
21.

2338
02:56:52,014 --> 02:56:53,506
LAURA: Plus ten!

2339
02:56:53,506 --> 02:56:54,765
TALIESIN: Plus ten. 31!

2340
02:56:54,765 --> 02:56:56,926
MATT: Okay. Grog's a ways back.

2341
02:56:56,926 --> 02:56:58,609
TRAVIS: Not stealthing.

2342
02:56:58,609 --> 02:57:03,216
TALIESIN: And I'm getting down. I'm preparing for
the shot.

2343
02:57:03,216 --> 02:57:04,198
LAURA: Ditto!

2344
02:57:04,198 --> 02:57:09,765
ASHLEY: I'm going to pull up my cloak and slowly
start crossing.

2345
02:57:09,765 --> 02:57:17,081
TALIESIN: I'm also going to activate the secondary
mechanism in the Diplomacy glove.

2346
02:57:17,081 --> 02:57:18,553
MATT: Okay.

2347
02:57:18,553 --> 02:57:26,531
MARISHA: I follow Pike and peck at her bread
crumbs as she crosses the road.

2348
02:57:26,531 --> 02:57:33,746
MATT: Okay! All right, so as this is happening,
and this is a really fast rush over, rush over,

2349
02:57:33,746 --> 02:57:40,709
get into places, and you watch as the horse has
galloped (hoofbeats). You have Pike in the middle

2350
02:57:40,709 --> 02:57:45,193
of the road, dressed the same in memory.

2351
02:57:45,193 --> 02:57:48,705
TRAVIS: I have to pee. It's like hide and go seek.
The waiting.

2352
02:57:48,705 --> 02:57:55,890
MATT: And you watch as the horse (hoofbeats) goes
off the path and begins to make a wide circle.

2353
02:57:55,890 --> 02:57:58,828
LAURA: Motherfucker! She's going around us?

2354
02:57:58,828 --> 02:58:00,662
MATT: Seemingly, yeah.

2355
02:58:00,662 --> 02:58:05,027
ASHLEY: Excuse me! Ma'am?

2356
02:58:05,027 --> 02:58:08,117
MATT: Full gallop burst.

2357
02:58:08,117 --> 02:58:10,323
MARISHA: I take off in crow form.

2358
02:58:10,323 --> 02:58:16,119
TALIESIN: I was actually going to-- the second she
started to leave the road, I take a shot.

2359
02:58:16,119 --> 02:58:17,098
MATT: At?

2360
02:58:17,098 --> 02:58:18,767
TALIESIN: At the horse's legs.

2361
02:58:18,767 --> 02:58:19,724
MATT: All right.

2362
02:58:19,724 --> 02:58:21,081
LAURA: We'll heal it!

2363
02:58:21,081 --> 02:58:23,369
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack with
disadvantage.

2364
02:58:23,369 --> 02:58:24,492
TALIESIN: Disadvantage?

2365
02:58:24,492 --> 02:58:26,368
MATT: Because you're aiming specifically for the
legs.

2366
02:58:26,368 --> 02:58:29,350
TALIESIN: Can I burn a grit for it?

2367
02:58:29,350 --> 02:58:33,702
MATT: Oh, you do technically have an actual--
yeah, so you will not have disadvantage on this.

2368
02:58:33,702 --> 02:58:36,050
TALIESIN: I'll burn a grit for this. This is worth
a grit.

2369
02:58:36,050 --> 02:58:39,324
LIAM: Horse killing is a feat you took, right?

2370
02:58:39,324 --> 02:58:40,798
MARISHA: We're gods, remember?

2371
02:58:40,798 --> 02:58:42,393
TRAVIS: Yeah. Remember that?

2372
02:58:42,393 --> 02:58:47,625
TALIESIN: That's not great, but it's not bad. 20.

2373
02:58:47,625 --> 02:58:52,224
MATT: 20 will hit. So what's the effect on that
one, again?

2374
02:58:52,224 --> 02:58:57,313
TALIESIN: That's a strength saving throw or
prone.

2375
02:58:57,313 --> 02:59:00,599
MATT: What's the DC?

2376
02:59:00,599 --> 02:59:02,041
TALIESIN: 20.

2377
02:59:02,041 --> 02:59:16,019
MATT: So you watch. No gunshot. Complete silence
as you all begin to maneuver. You watch as the

2378
02:59:16,019 --> 02:59:25,186
horse suddenly (neighs) and goes ass over tea
kettle forward, jettisoning both Taryon and the

2379
02:59:25,186 --> 02:59:34,844
rider from the horse into a neat roll. Since you
have not moved, Tary, you make a full spill,

2380
02:59:34,844 --> 02:59:39,006
skittering across the ground.

2381
02:59:39,006 --> 02:59:40,572
SAM: (screams)

2382
02:59:40,572 --> 02:59:43,010
MATT: You suffer ten points of bludgeoning
damage.

2383
02:59:43,010 --> 02:59:45,089
TRAVIS: What about the horse. Does he fall off?

2384
02:59:45,089 --> 02:59:48,309
MATT: No, the horse is prone and still takes
damage from the shot, so roll damage.

2385
02:59:48,309 --> 02:59:50,020
TALIESIN: Oh, and also takes damage.

2386
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:52,607
MATT: Because you shot it with...

2387
02:59:52,607 --> 02:59:58,402
TALIESIN: I did. I really shot it. It didn't have
a good day. Do I have enough...

2388
02:59:58,402 --> 03:00:02,021
LAURA: We'll heal it so good!

2389
03:00:02,021 --> 03:00:03,455
TRAVIS: I'm going to eat it.

2390
03:00:03,455 --> 03:00:10,774
TALIESIN: There's no horse left. Yeah, oh boy.
That's 30 points of damage.

2391
03:00:10,774 --> 03:00:12,615
MATT: 30 points of damage!

2392
03:00:12,615 --> 03:00:14,829
LAURA: Is that a lot for a horse?

2393
03:00:14,829 --> 03:00:19,164
TALIESIN: That's my maximum damage with a single
unaffected shot.

2394
03:00:19,237 --> 03:00:26,586
MATT: Yeah, as the horse skids over and hits the
ground, it falls onto its side, and you watch its

2395
03:00:26,586 --> 03:00:28,245
heavy breathing become still.

2396
03:00:28,245 --> 03:00:29,643
LAURA and ASHLEY: No!

2397
03:00:29,643 --> 03:00:30,808
TRAVIS: Dinner!

2398
03:00:30,808 --> 03:00:36,630
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a second shot. The second I
see her head, I am taking a

2399
03:00:36,630 --> 03:00:37,727
head shot on this girl.

2400
03:00:37,727 --> 03:00:41,420
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check because you
were down in the grass.

2401
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:44,746
TALIESIN: Nope.

2402
03:00:44,746 --> 03:00:50,166
SAM: I lift my head up. What's going on?

2403
03:00:50,166 --> 03:00:52,271
MATT: You can't, because you are tied.

2404
03:00:52,271 --> 03:00:53,193
TALIESIN: 11.

2405
03:00:53,193 --> 03:00:56,519
MATT: No, you see nothing. What were you doing?

2406
03:00:56,519 --> 03:00:57,942
LIAM: (whoosh)

2407
03:00:57,942 --> 03:01:00,320
MATT: Okay, so you (whoosh) up in the air. Okay.

2408
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:03,486
LAURA: I'm brooming.

2409
03:01:03,486 --> 03:01:10,592
MATT: You're brooming towards. All right, so she
comes to a tumble. For this purpose, I'm going to

2410
03:01:10,592 --> 03:01:16,390
have you two, since you're both pretty quick, roll
initiative checks, please.

2411
03:01:16,390 --> 03:01:20,525
LAURA: 26.

2412
03:01:20,525 --> 03:01:24,647
LIAM: 24.

2413
03:01:24,647 --> 03:01:35,235
MATT: Jesus. Okay. So. You both rush over and you
watch as she tumbles and catches herself, skidding

2414
03:01:35,235 --> 03:01:44,827
into the dirt. You can see bits where she's rubbed
and gashed in the face. Pale skin, blonde hair,

2415
03:01:44,827 --> 03:01:50,349
nowhere near the description that you were given
by those who were trying to scry earlier, but

2416
03:01:50,349 --> 03:01:55,285
catches herself and lands, reaches over and sees
Taryon about three feet behind and immediately

2417
03:01:55,285 --> 03:01:57,228
darts over, grabbing something from the satchel--

2418
03:01:57,228 --> 03:01:59,323
LAURA: Can I shoot her with an arrow?

2419
03:01:59,323 --> 03:02:06,913
MATT: It would've taken your movement to get to
her, but you can move half as quickly and go for a

2420
03:02:06,913 --> 03:02:07,967
shot if you want to.

2421
03:02:07,967 --> 03:02:09,053
LAURA: I want to try to go for a shot.

2422
03:02:09,053 --> 03:02:10,365
LIAM: How close are we, right in this second?

2423
03:02:10,365 --> 03:02:18,008
MATT: Well, you're going to close the distance
because you're apparently a bullet. Learn to

2424
03:02:18,008 --> 03:02:19,837
balance your magical items, people!

2425
03:02:19,837 --> 03:02:21,182
LIAM: Or not.

2426
03:02:21,182 --> 03:02:22,280
MATT: Or not.

2427
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:27,099
LAURA: Or let your players spread them out and not
keep them all for themselves.

2428
03:02:27,099 --> 03:02:29,178
MATT: Exactly, yeah.

2429
03:02:29,247 --> 03:02:31,204
LIAM: Salt, salt.

2430
03:02:31,204 --> 03:02:35,516
MATT: It's all good. So you'll be able to get your
shots off about the time that you get there.

2431
03:02:35,516 --> 03:02:42,979
LAURA: Salty. Oh no.

2432
03:02:42,979 --> 03:02:45,316
LIAM: You got a four because of all that salt.

2433
03:02:45,316 --> 03:02:46,886
LAURA: Yeah, I know. That was 19.

2434
03:02:46,886 --> 03:02:48,284
MATT: That hits.

2435
03:02:48,284 --> 03:02:52,404
LAURA: The first, and then more than that on the
second.

2436
03:02:52,404 --> 03:02:54,296
MATT: Okay, so both hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

2437
03:02:54,296 --> 03:02:58,531
LAURA: Oh, is it too late to say I want one to be
a bramble shot?

2438
03:02:58,531 --> 03:03:01,163
MATT: You can bramble shot, sure.

2439
03:03:01,163 --> 03:03:02,978
LAURA: Yeah! Okay!

2440
03:03:02,978 --> 03:03:06,939
MATT: You decide a bramble shot as you hit.

2441
03:03:06,939 --> 03:03:09,330
LAURA: Oh, sweet! DC of 17.

2442
03:03:09,330 --> 03:03:13,055
MATT: DC of 17? Not with an eight.

2443
03:03:13,055 --> 03:03:14,776
LAURA: She's restrained!

2444
03:03:14,776 --> 03:03:15,997
MATT: She's restrained.

2445
03:03:15,997 --> 03:03:18,201
TRAVIS: Nice. That's huge.

2446
03:03:18,201 --> 03:03:21,281
LAURA: 12, 13.

2447
03:03:21,281 --> 03:03:25,916
SAM: Pretty calm fight music, Matt.

2448
03:03:25,964 --> 03:03:31,862
MATT: The volume is really low on that speaker. My
apologies.

2449
03:03:31,862 --> 03:03:33,690
LAURA: 13 plus eight is 21.

2450
03:03:33,690 --> 03:03:35,285
MATT: There we go.

2451
03:03:35,285 --> 03:03:45,334
LAURA: 21 plus eight is 29, plus 1d6 lightning
damage. 29 plus six is 35! 35 on the first shot.

2452
03:03:45,334 --> 03:03:46,415
MATT: All righty.

2453
03:03:46,415 --> 03:04:02,860
LAURA: And then 16. 24 on the second, and I was
wrong, add two more to the first shot because I

2454
03:04:02,860 --> 03:04:04,292
forgot I was using my bracers.

2455
03:04:04,292 --> 03:04:11,947
MATT: Okay, so 37, got it. So you (flying arrows)
and fire both off as your broom is coasting inward

2456
03:04:11,947 --> 03:04:17,671
from an arc and the first arrow catches her in the
knee and she (yelps) and is still reaching for

2457
03:04:17,671 --> 03:04:22,107
Taryon. However, as the arrow smashes into her, it
bursts into a series of thorny vines that (whoosh)

2458
03:04:22,107 --> 03:04:28,182
wrap around and ensnare her and she falls over,
now bound like Taryon is for the moment. Falls on

2459
03:04:28,182 --> 03:04:31,708
the ground. Whatever was in her hand stumbles
forward.

2460
03:04:31,708 --> 03:04:33,527
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah!

2461
03:04:33,527 --> 03:04:37,058
MATT: And she's like (grunts) reaching out just as
the second arrow hits her in the back and (groans)

2462
03:04:37,058 --> 03:04:39,965
gives out a yelp in pain. Vax.

2463
03:04:39,965 --> 03:04:42,853
LIAM: What distance am I right now, would you
say?

2464
03:04:42,853 --> 03:04:48,931
MATT: You almost closed the distance with your
movement.

2465
03:04:48,931 --> 03:04:51,565
TRAVIS: Get in there, Barry Allen.

2466
03:04:51,565 --> 03:04:54,315
LIAM: Okay, but am I within 50 feet? 60 feet?

2467
03:04:54,315 --> 03:04:55,488
MATT: You're within 60 feet.

2468
03:04:55,488 --> 03:05:01,575
LIAM: 60 feet? All right, so I'm going to throw
Whisper at her, and she's brambled.

2469
03:05:01,575 --> 03:05:03,962
MATT: She's restrained; you have advantage.

2470
03:05:03,962 --> 03:05:13,644
LIAM: Right. Yeah, that hits. That's a 32. I'm
going to bamf there on this one, right up to her.

2471
03:05:13,644 --> 03:05:23,654
That is four plus eight is 12, plus this guy makes
it 19, plus these guys. Now we do some more math.

2472
03:05:23,654 --> 03:05:36,138
20, 26, 27, 31, 34, 39, 42. With Whisper, right
into her back, and then click the Boots of Haste

2473
03:05:36,138 --> 03:05:42,545
and then I'm going to scuttle to Tary and cut
ropes. He's probably within ten feet, right?

2474
03:05:42,545 --> 03:05:45,048
MATT: Yeah, he's like five feet from her.

2475
03:05:45,048 --> 03:05:52,439
LIAM: All right, so I'm cutting him totally loose
and I'm going to lift him away. Whatever you'll

2476
03:05:52,439 --> 03:05:56,725
let me do. Action, action, bonus action, right,
and movement to get there.

2477
03:05:56,725 --> 03:06:01,504
MATT: Well, no. Your movement was to get there,
your action was to attack her, and so you have

2478
03:06:01,504 --> 03:06:02,992
your bonus action, still.

2479
03:06:02,992 --> 03:06:04,899
LIAM: Then I'll use it to cut him loose.

2480
03:06:04,899 --> 03:06:08,024
MATT: Okay, you begin to cut him loose. Because
there's a lot of ropes around him, there's not a

2481
03:06:08,024 --> 03:06:08,990
single binding.

2482
03:06:08,990 --> 03:06:11,578
LIAM: Okay. Good enough.

2483
03:06:11,578 --> 03:06:24,031
MATT: All right, so now it's her turn. She's bound
on the ground. Coughs up blood as she's suffered a

2484
03:06:24,031 --> 03:06:32,412
severe amount of damage in just a few moments. As
she's lying there on the ground, the vines

2485
03:06:32,412 --> 03:06:45,539
twisting around her, she goes, "Wait. Wait.
(sighs) Stop." And she's going to...

2486
03:06:45,539 --> 03:06:47,673
what's the DC?

2487
03:06:47,673 --> 03:06:50,217
LAURA: 17.

2488
03:06:50,217 --> 03:06:57,616
MATT: 17. She does manage to break free from the
restraints. She breaks free from the vines, and

2489
03:06:57,616 --> 03:07:03,294
then she puts her hands up. That's her turn.

2490
03:07:03,294 --> 03:07:04,925
LAURA: Can I land?

2491
03:07:04,925 --> 03:07:08,483
MATT: Yeah. If anyone else wants to take any of
their actions right now, we're technically not in

2492
03:07:08,483 --> 03:07:11,281
initiative order. She's put her hands up.

2493
03:07:11,281 --> 03:07:19,036
TALIESIN: I'm slowly making my way a little closer
to the action, but I'm going to find a place where

2494
03:07:19,036 --> 03:07:22,558
I can watch both sides of the road and also what's
happening off the road right now.

2495
03:07:22,558 --> 03:07:23,628
MATT: Okay.

2496
03:07:23,628 --> 03:07:26,141
TRAVIS: I'm writing my name in the path with a
stick.

2497
03:07:26,141 --> 03:07:28,880
LAURA: I'm grabbing the thing that she was trying
to grab.

2498
03:07:28,880 --> 03:07:33,092
MARISHA: Same as Percy, but as a crow.

2499
03:07:33,092 --> 03:07:37,100
TALIESIN: Actually, if you come-- well, that would
be interesting, actually.

2500
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:38,524
MARISHA: (caws)

2501
03:07:38,524 --> 03:07:44,229
MATT: What you find on the ground is a small
marble, similar in size to the one that you saw

2502
03:07:44,229 --> 03:07:49,986
attached to the side of Doty earlier, but it's a
different color. The one that you saw earlier was

2503
03:07:49,986 --> 03:07:53,223
a bluish tint, a light blue tint. This one appears
clear.

2504
03:07:53,223 --> 03:07:57,575
LAURA: Can I pick it up? I'll pocket that shit.

2505
03:07:57,575 --> 03:07:58,799
MATT: Okay.

2506
03:07:58,799 --> 03:08:02,796
SAM: Can I stand up yet? Am I still tied up?

2507
03:08:02,796 --> 03:08:07,924
MATT: At the moment, as all of you begin to
converge and close in on her, she just has her

2508
03:08:07,924 --> 03:08:15,536
hands up at this point. I'd say for the next
minute or so, you get cut free, yeah. You still

2509
03:08:15,536 --> 03:08:20,192
have your armor on, you still have all your
equipment that was on you. Yeah, she took

2510
03:08:20,332 --> 03:08:26,287
everything with you. You're not robbed. You were
just bound and taken.

2511
03:08:26,287 --> 03:08:28,377
LIAM: You all right, T?

2512
03:08:28,377 --> 03:08:33,956
SAM: I will, yeah. (panting) What took you people
so long? I was on a horse

2513
03:08:33,956 --> 03:08:35,779
for what felt like days!

2514
03:08:35,779 --> 03:08:37,887
LIAM: Well, initially we thought you could handle
it.

2515
03:08:37,887 --> 03:08:40,815
SAM: No! You know me better than that!

2516
03:08:40,815 --> 03:08:42,516
LAURA: We're here, aren't we?

2517
03:08:42,516 --> 03:08:45,675
MATT: You do have a massive headache, by the way.
It's pounding.

2518
03:08:45,675 --> 03:08:48,115
SAM: Please tell me that someone brought my
toothbrush.

2519
03:08:48,115 --> 03:08:51,767
LAURA: Your breath smells disgusting right now.

2520
03:08:51,767 --> 03:08:59,567
SAM: Please don't smell it. I'm very embarrassed.
I went to sleep. I don't know what this is! I

2521
03:08:59,567 --> 03:09:03,943
mean. She's taking me. She's paid by my father,
probably.

2522
03:09:03,943 --> 03:09:05,462
ASHLEY: What's your name?

2523
03:09:05,462 --> 03:09:11,196
MATT: "K'ryyn."

2524
03:09:11,196 --> 03:09:13,306
ALL: K'ryyn?

2525
03:09:13,306 --> 03:09:20,112
SAM: And what, you work for my father? On a
regular basis?

2526
03:09:20,112 --> 03:09:23,330
MATT: "I was contracted by your father. This is
the first time."

2527
03:09:23,330 --> 03:09:27,321
LAURA: Just to find him? And bring him back?

2528
03:09:27,321 --> 03:09:29,311
MATT: "That's what I do."

2529
03:09:29,311 --> 03:09:34,295
LAURA: How much were you being paid? I want to
know how much he's worth.

2530
03:09:34,295 --> 03:09:38,214
LIAM: You're not really in a position of power
here, darling.

2531
03:09:38,214 --> 03:09:43,117
MATT: "Upon delivery, I was to be paid 5,000 gold
pieces."

2532
03:09:43,117 --> 03:09:47,554
SAM: Oh, that's nearly nothing. I'm worth far more
than that.

2533
03:09:47,554 --> 03:09:50,324
LAURA: You know his father has way more money than
that.

2534
03:09:50,324 --> 03:09:52,694
LIAM: You are rose gold.

2535
03:09:52,694 --> 03:09:54,530
SAM: I am.

2536
03:09:54,530 --> 03:09:57,117
LAURA: How long ago did he send you?

2537
03:09:57,117 --> 03:10:02,439
MATT: "He sent me out on this job about two months
back."

2538
03:10:02,439 --> 03:10:14,355
LAURA: It took that long to find him? Does anyone
in this town, Deastok, know about Whitestone? Know

2539
03:10:14,355 --> 03:10:16,645
where you found him?

2540
03:10:16,645 --> 03:10:20,183
MATT: "Not to my knowledge. I don't care about
people in this town. I was called here to pick up

2541
03:10:20,183 --> 03:10:21,453
"the contract, and I left."

2542
03:10:21,453 --> 03:10:23,369
LAURA: What guild do you work for?

2543
03:10:23,369 --> 03:10:25,582
MATT: "I work for no guild. I am a solo agent."

2544
03:10:25,582 --> 03:10:27,889
SAM: So cool.

2545
03:10:27,889 --> 03:10:29,824
LAURA: Can I insight check her?

2546
03:10:29,824 --> 03:10:31,338
MATT: Go for it.

2547
03:10:31,338 --> 03:10:37,633
LAURA: She's so cool. 17.

2548
03:10:37,633 --> 03:10:47,589
MATT: 17? She's hard to read. By nature and by
business, you get the sense, and at this point as

2549
03:10:47,589 --> 03:10:55,396
you're looking at her, she sees you glaring and
looking over her intensely, she (sighs) takes one

2550
03:10:55,396 --> 03:11:00,195
hand up under her hood and presses her thumb to
the side of what looks like a small circlet, and

2551
03:11:00,195 --> 03:11:07,106
her image shimmers and you now see before you the
drow elf that was described to you, wincing as the

2552
03:11:07,106 --> 03:11:13,635
sun is still in the sky and you can see, while the
illusion did not seem to give off that, she's

2553
03:11:13,635 --> 03:11:17,900
physically not enjoying being under direct
sunlight.

2554
03:11:17,900 --> 03:11:20,418
LIAM: Bet you're glad for that cloud cover today,
aren't you?

2555
03:11:20,418 --> 03:11:27,297
MATT: "It's been helpful. That's why I prefer to
do most of my work in Wildmount."

2556
03:11:27,297 --> 03:11:30,269
LIAM: What should we do here?

2557
03:11:30,269 --> 03:11:37,818
SAM: Well, we should bind her and search her. Make
sure she's not holding any weapons or anything.

2558
03:11:37,818 --> 03:11:40,913
TRAVIS: You were just supposed to bring Tary back
to his dad?

2559
03:11:40,913 --> 03:11:47,053
MATT: "That is all. Unharmed. I took great care to
make sure he was not harmed. I have a business I

2560
03:11:47,053 --> 03:11:49,462
"run based purely on reputation."

2561
03:11:49,462 --> 03:11:58,960
SAM: I respect that, but I did get a bruise right
here from the horse falling over, so I'm not

2562
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:00,258
totally okay.

2563
03:12:00,258 --> 03:12:03,940
MATT: "That is, apparently, an issue for you to
take up with your friends."

2564
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:08,519
TRAVIS: Tary, I thought you left your home. Or
were you kicked out?

2565
03:12:08,519 --> 03:12:09,875
SAM: I left.

2566
03:12:09,875 --> 03:12:10,858
TRAVIS: Yeah?

2567
03:12:10,858 --> 03:12:13,019
SAM: Yes. I left of my own accord.

2568
03:12:13,019 --> 03:12:19,191
LAURA: Did you leave suddenly, without any word,
or did they know you were leaving?

2569
03:12:19,191 --> 03:12:21,038
SAM: They knew I was leaving.

2570
03:12:21,038 --> 03:12:26,211
LIAM: And how do you want to play this? Because
your pops wants you back, obviously.

2571
03:12:26,211 --> 03:12:34,100
SAM: Well, this is just some paid shithead, so I
don't think we should kill her

2572
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:35,824
or anything like that.

2573
03:12:35,824 --> 03:12:40,381
LAURA: What happens if you don't deliver your
quarry?

2574
03:12:40,381 --> 03:12:48,731
MATT: "Then my contract is broken, I do not get
paid, and it is a blight on future business."

2575
03:12:48,731 --> 03:12:55,900
TRAVIS: Are you armed? Somebody remove her weapons
so she can put her arms down.

2576
03:12:55,900 --> 03:13:04,768
MATT: You pat her down? Yeah, she has two daggers,
one placed in each boot, stealthily hidden. She

2577
03:13:04,768 --> 03:13:12,545
has a shortbow that is over her chest and
shoulder, and a side quiver of about 40 arrows.

2578
03:13:12,545 --> 03:13:14,833
LAURA: Oh shit! These are good arrows.

2579
03:13:14,833 --> 03:13:19,486
MATT: She goes, "Thank you."

2580
03:13:19,486 --> 03:13:23,878
LAURA: Just noticed the good work, that's all.

2581
03:13:24,018 --> 03:13:25,793
MATT: "I make them myself."

2582
03:13:25,793 --> 03:13:28,389
LAURA: I show her one of my owlbear arrows.

2583
03:13:28,389 --> 03:13:29,589
MATT: "Owlbear?"

2584
03:13:29,589 --> 03:13:30,838
LAURA: I know.

2585
03:13:30,838 --> 03:13:35,193
(laughter)

2586
03:13:35,193 --> 03:13:38,765
LIAM: What do you want to do?

2587
03:13:38,765 --> 03:13:42,296
SAM: I want to take her belongings and send her on
her way.

2588
03:13:42,296 --> 03:13:43,813
TRAVIS: You don't want to see her dead?

2589
03:13:43,813 --> 03:13:46,819
SAM: That's a separate question, isn't it?

2590
03:13:46,819 --> 03:13:48,604
TRAVIS: Yep.

2591
03:13:48,604 --> 03:13:57,817
SAM: We're very close-- proximity, I mean. Seems
foolish not to at least go have it out with him.

2592
03:13:57,817 --> 03:14:05,358
This is unacceptable behavior, I think, in any
relationship. This is not cool, right?

2593
03:14:05,358 --> 03:14:07,717
LAURA: No, he should have offered way more money
for you.

2594
03:14:07,717 --> 03:14:09,012
SAM: Well, yes, there's that, too.

2595
03:14:09,012 --> 03:14:14,087
TRAVIS: She did surrender. I'm just thinking,
maybe we go in, she gets paid, she keeps her

2596
03:14:14,087 --> 03:14:16,515
reputation, and then you can--

2597
03:14:16,515 --> 03:14:18,803
SAM: You want her to get paid? She kidnapped me!

2598
03:14:18,803 --> 03:14:23,299
ASHLEY: You should still make your dad pay,
though!

2599
03:14:23,299 --> 03:14:26,599
SAM: What?!

2600
03:14:26,599 --> 03:14:29,529
ASHLEY: You could say, I would've come here--

2601
03:14:29,529 --> 03:14:32,735
SAM: She committed a crime against me. I don't
want her to get money!

2602
03:14:32,735 --> 03:14:38,442
MATT: As you're having this conversation, she
slowly puts her hands down.

2603
03:14:38,442 --> 03:14:40,341
LIAM: I'm still watching.

2604
03:14:40,341 --> 03:14:43,409
TRAVIS: And she surrendered, right?

2605
03:14:43,409 --> 03:14:53,045
SAM: I'm sorry. I guess I was raised with a
different appreciation for money, but Pike, your

2606
03:14:53,045 --> 03:14:59,045
family came in and robbed us and you gave them a
bunch of gold. Then this person kidnapped me, and

2607
03:14:59,045 --> 03:15:00,906
you want to give her 5,000 gold.

2608
03:15:00,906 --> 03:15:05,254
LAURA: Well, we don't want to give her 5,000 gold.
We want your dad to have to give her 5,000 gold.

2609
03:15:05,322 --> 03:15:09,546
ASHLEY: And if you show up with all of us and her,
say you could've just called, I would've shown up,

2610
03:15:09,546 --> 03:15:10,899
but you still have to pay her.

2611
03:15:10,899 --> 03:15:12,995
SAM: You think he'll be guilted?

2612
03:15:12,995 --> 03:15:16,246
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know him.

2613
03:15:16,246 --> 03:15:18,612
TALIESIN: I think it might be an easy way into the
city.

2614
03:15:18,612 --> 03:15:22,107
SAM: I live in the city. I'll just walk in!

2615
03:15:22,178 --> 03:15:24,576
TRAVIS: Maybe she owes us one after this.

2616
03:15:24,576 --> 03:15:26,193
SAM: It's my house!

2617
03:15:26,193 --> 03:15:28,827
LAURA: Should we all be in disguise?

2618
03:15:28,827 --> 03:15:31,659
LIAM: Are you sure you're cool to walk in right
now?

2619
03:15:31,659 --> 03:15:39,015
SAM: Yes! I'm Taryon fucking Darrington. People
shake when they see me walking

2620
03:15:39,015 --> 03:15:40,797
down the street here.

2621
03:15:40,797 --> 03:15:48,210
ASHLEY: You know, she was able to find you. Maybe
she could also find somebody else for us.

2622
03:15:48,210 --> 03:15:49,482
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2623
03:15:49,482 --> 03:15:50,829
SAM: Who?

2624
03:15:50,829 --> 03:15:52,586
ASHLEY: A very good friend.

2625
03:15:52,586 --> 03:15:54,784
LAURA: I think that's a wonderful idea.

2626
03:15:54,784 --> 03:16:00,281
TRAVIS: Yeah. Maybe she owes us one. K'ryyn, would
you like to owe us a favor if we let you live, and

2627
03:16:00,334 --> 03:16:03,641
get you paid, and you keep your reputation all on
the same day?

2628
03:16:03,641 --> 03:16:11,732
MATT: "To be perfectly honest, this is an offer I
very well cannot refuse, given the circumstances.

2629
03:16:11,732 --> 03:16:14,155
"If you are serious."

2630
03:16:14,155 --> 03:16:16,916
LAURA: We are. We want you to find someone.

2631
03:16:16,916 --> 03:16:20,315
MATT: "Then find them, I will."

2632
03:16:20,315 --> 03:16:26,607
SAM: I abstain! With an attitude!

2633
03:16:26,662 --> 03:16:33,784
TRAVIS: Noted. All in favor of getting her paid,
letting her live, and earning a favor?

2634
03:16:33,784 --> 03:16:39,618
ASHLEY: Well, hold on, Tary. If you had it your
way, what would you want?

2635
03:16:39,618 --> 03:16:42,063
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

2636
03:16:42,063 --> 03:16:46,144
ASHLEY: Majority rules, but let's hear what you
have to say.

2637
03:16:46,144 --> 03:16:47,859
SAM: I would like an apology.

2638
03:16:47,859 --> 03:16:49,333
TALIESIN: I think that's fair.

2639
03:16:49,333 --> 03:16:51,374
LAURA and ASHLEY: That's fair.

2640
03:16:51,374 --> 03:17:04,809
MATT: Her eyes become these narrow slits and the
jaw clenches. "I apologize for any discomfort or

2641
03:17:04,809 --> 03:17:08,098
"embarrassment my retrieval of you may have caused."

2642
03:17:08,138 --> 03:17:10,146
LAURA: That's a good apology.

2643
03:17:10,146 --> 03:17:14,997
SAM: And as to the amount that was promised, do
you think that was a fair amount?

2644
03:17:14,997 --> 03:17:16,980
TRAVIS: Oh, this is a bit much.

2645
03:17:16,980 --> 03:17:20,581
MATT: "It was my standard rate."

2646
03:17:20,581 --> 03:17:33,590
SAM: I accept your apology. And as I said, I
admire your diligence and faith to your contract.

2647
03:17:33,590 --> 03:17:37,741
You don't get any of your belongings back! Is that
all right?

2648
03:17:37,741 --> 03:17:39,469
ALL: (negative noises)

2649
03:17:39,537 --> 03:17:40,797
LAURA: She might need it.

2650
03:17:40,797 --> 03:17:44,250
SAM: You don't get any of your magical belongings
back! I want it.

2651
03:17:44,250 --> 03:17:46,788
LAURA: Well, I want you to look at them. I want to
know what it is.

2652
03:17:46,788 --> 03:17:53,814
SAM: Yeah. But we'll, I guess, walk in together
and you can present me to my father. This seems so

2653
03:17:53,814 --> 03:17:55,891
stupid, but sure, I'll go along with it.

2654
03:17:55,891 --> 03:18:01,046
LAURA: And then you'll help us out.

2655
03:18:01,046 --> 03:18:05,391
MATT: "Very well. It seems we are at an accord."

2656
03:18:05,391 --> 03:18:07,871
LIAM: I'm going to yank Vex aside, actually.

2657
03:18:07,921 --> 03:18:11,674
LAURA: Well, I'm going to shake her hand before--
shit.

2658
03:18:11,674 --> 03:18:13,548
LIAM: Are you talking about what I think you are
talking about?

2659
03:18:13,548 --> 03:18:14,480
LAURA: Yeah!

2660
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:15,887
LIAM: You want to send her after your friend?

2661
03:18:15,887 --> 03:18:17,720
LAURA: Our friend.

2662
03:18:17,720 --> 03:18:26,434
LIAM: You think he wants a mercenary showing up in
his life, looking for him? Think about it.

2663
03:18:26,434 --> 03:18:28,132
LAURA: He could be dead.

2664
03:18:28,132 --> 03:18:30,101
LIAM: He's doing what he wants to do.

2665
03:18:30,101 --> 03:18:37,628
ASHLEY: Did I overhear them?

2666
03:18:37,628 --> 03:18:51,814
MATT: Make a perception check.

2667
03:18:51,866 --> 03:18:54,408
ASHLEY: 16.

2668
03:18:54,408 --> 03:18:57,387
MATT: How quiet were you guys being?

2669
03:18:57,387 --> 03:18:59,136
TALIESIN: Pretty quiet.

2670
03:18:59,136 --> 03:19:01,674
MATT: You glean elements of the conversation.

2671
03:19:01,674 --> 03:19:03,032
LIAM: I wasn't trying to hide it.

2672
03:19:03,032 --> 03:19:05,325
MATT: Yeah, you get the gist of what they were
talking about.

2673
03:19:05,325 --> 03:19:19,036
ASHLEY: Okay. She doesn't have to bring him or
anything, it could be just looking, bring us

2674
03:19:19,036 --> 03:19:20,986
information if she sees him.

2675
03:19:20,986 --> 03:19:22,818
TRAVIS: Like a two-day report.

2676
03:19:22,818 --> 03:19:32,088
ASHLEY: We don't have to! We don't have to do it,
but I do like the idea of this woman-- this woman

2677
03:19:32,088 --> 03:19:41,926
had a job to do. It's not her fault. I'm sorry,
Tary, but I do feel like we need to let her

2678
03:19:41,926 --> 03:19:46,139
complete her mission.

2679
03:19:46,139 --> 03:19:48,270
TALIESIN: It's a bit her fault.

2680
03:19:48,270 --> 03:19:55,497
SAM: Fine. And then we can send her to look after
that little creep that you're always talking

2681
03:19:55,497 --> 03:19:56,823
about.

2682
03:19:56,823 --> 03:20:02,056
LIAM: When you were in Vasselheim--

2683
03:20:02,056 --> 03:20:06,468
LAURA: It was a cube, Tary. Like a cube.

2684
03:20:06,468 --> 03:20:10,276
SAM: That's gross. That's disgusting.

2685
03:20:10,276 --> 03:20:15,944
LIAM: How would you feel if you learned that we'd
sent someone to watch you? He left. He wanted to

2686
03:20:15,998 --> 03:20:19,396
go. He wanted to be away from us.

2687
03:20:19,396 --> 03:20:21,552
ASHLEY: I know.

2688
03:20:21,552 --> 03:20:23,604
LIAM: If he wants to come back, I want him back.

2689
03:20:23,604 --> 03:20:28,568
ASHLEY: I know, but I feel like he should've come
back already.

2690
03:20:28,568 --> 03:20:30,627
LAURA: What if he's dead?

2691
03:20:30,627 --> 03:20:32,056
ASHLEY: What if he's dead?

2692
03:20:32,056 --> 03:20:36,042
LIAM: What if he's being a father to his child?
What if he's enjoying his life?

2693
03:20:36,042 --> 03:20:37,172
TRAVIS: Boring.

2694
03:20:37,172 --> 03:20:41,094
ASHLEY: If that's the case, then maybe she can
tell us that and then we'll leave it alone. But

2695
03:20:41,094 --> 03:20:42,587
what if he's dead?

2696
03:20:42,587 --> 03:20:45,223
TALIESIN: Why doesn't she just owe us one favor to
be claimed later?

2697
03:20:45,223 --> 03:20:47,261
ASHLEY: Yes, I like that idea.

2698
03:20:47,261 --> 03:20:50,072
MARISHA: I fly down to Pike's shoulder and I go,
(caws).

2699
03:20:50,072 --> 03:20:51,823
LAURA: Yeah, I know, right?

2700
03:20:51,823 --> 03:20:55,464
ASHLEY: See, she thinks-- I like that idea. She
owes us a favor at some point.

2701
03:20:55,464 --> 03:20:58,138
TRAVIS: But I want to find Scanlan!

2702
03:20:58,138 --> 03:21:01,214
ASHLEY: Maybe we should table it.

2703
03:21:01,214 --> 03:21:06,359
SAM: Yeah, let's go talk to my dad and get this
settled, and then we'll figure out your next

2704
03:21:06,359 --> 03:21:07,793
assignment or whatever.

2705
03:21:07,793 --> 03:21:10,176
LAURA: You'll hang out, though? You're not going
to disappear?

2706
03:21:10,176 --> 03:21:17,722
MATT: "I have business still to make, and you have
been merciful, so I will remain."

2707
03:21:17,722 --> 03:21:23,952
MARISHA: I fly over to Percy's shoulder and I go,
(caws).

2708
03:21:23,952 --> 03:21:25,336
TALIESIN: I am Groot.

2709
03:21:25,336 --> 03:21:30,078
MATT: "Very well. Into the city, then?"

2710
03:21:30,078 --> 03:21:32,677
SAM: Yes.

2711
03:21:32,677 --> 03:21:42,510
MATT: She looks back at her horse. "I assume we'll
be walking. Very well." And her image shimmers

2712
03:21:42,510 --> 03:21:49,212
once more to the pale-skinned blonde woman in the
same outfit, and you all walk along with her

2713
03:21:49,212 --> 03:21:54,577
through the forest, down the path, through the
farm fields, making your way to the outskirts of

2714
03:21:54,577 --> 03:22:00,775
Deastok. As you are making your way up the
hillside path, one of the patrol guards comes down

2715
03:22:00,821 --> 03:22:07,096
on horseback, crossbow slung over his shoulder and
his hand on the side of his sword as he glances

2716
03:22:07,096 --> 03:22:14,559
down and goes, "Hail, you there!" And as soon as
he glances over the group of you.

2717
03:22:14,559 --> 03:22:18,399
"Mister Darrington, welcome home."

2718
03:22:18,399 --> 03:22:23,352
SAM: Thank you. These are my friends. They should
be treated with respect.

2719
03:22:23,352 --> 03:22:27,366
MATT: "Of course. Good day."

2720
03:22:27,366 --> 03:22:29,527
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Bidet.

2721
03:22:29,527 --> 03:22:35,805
MATT: He continues clomping by, (hoofbeats),
making his way down the rest of his patrol.

2722
03:22:35,805 --> 03:22:38,870
TALIESIN: It's going to be a dark window, isn't
it? This entire trip.

2723
03:22:38,870 --> 03:22:44,835
SAM: No, the town was never the problem. It's a
fine place to grow up.

2724
03:22:44,835 --> 03:22:51,079
TALIESIN: I'm very curious. Let's see this place.

2725
03:22:51,079 --> 03:22:52,174
SAM: Sure.

2726
03:22:52,174 --> 03:22:56,950
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and drop form so I'm not a
bird.

2727
03:22:56,950 --> 03:22:58,314
TALIESIN: Ow! Oh god!

2728
03:22:58,314 --> 03:23:02,427
MARISHA: Oh, I always forget that. I'm so sorry.

2729
03:23:02,427 --> 03:23:04,498
TALIESIN: That's all right, it's not my shooting
arm.

2730
03:23:04,498 --> 03:23:05,847
MARISHA: I'm learning, still.

2731
03:23:05,847 --> 03:23:06,709
TALIESIN: I know.

2732
03:23:06,709 --> 03:23:07,547
MARISHA: Sorry!

2733
03:23:07,547 --> 03:23:08,451
TALIESIN: It's okay.

2734
03:23:08,451 --> 03:23:10,365
MARISHA: Here, let me just--

2735
03:23:10,365 --> 03:23:12,106
TALIESIN: Yeah, ow. Yeah.

2736
03:23:12,106 --> 03:23:13,120
MARISHA: There you go.

2737
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:15,265
TALIESIN: I'll need a bit more later. Thanks.

2738
03:23:15,265 --> 03:23:16,449
LAURA: Tary?

2739
03:23:16,449 --> 03:23:17,601
SAM: Yeah, oi?

2740
03:23:17,601 --> 03:23:18,865
LAURA: I'm sorry.

2741
03:23:18,865 --> 03:23:20,061
SAM: For what?

2742
03:23:20,061 --> 03:23:22,100
LAURA: Well, you know.

2743
03:23:22,100 --> 03:23:28,557
SAM: No, you're right. We can't punish people who
are just hired to do a job. It's fine.

2744
03:23:28,557 --> 03:23:30,630
LAURA: It's how we all started out, really.

2745
03:23:30,630 --> 03:23:32,081
SAM: Yes, I hired you.

2746
03:23:32,081 --> 03:23:33,605
LAURA: Okay.

2747
03:23:33,605 --> 03:23:37,283
TALIESIN: He's got a point.

2748
03:23:37,283 --> 03:23:47,317
SAM: And now, we're so close! Here, let's go to my
dad's house, but... I need to make an entrance.

2749
03:23:47,317 --> 03:23:49,989
I'll be on broom.

2750
03:23:49,989 --> 03:23:52,001
LAURA: Can I be on broom, too, though?

2751
03:23:52,001 --> 03:23:59,015
SAM: Yes. Behind me. And I should be front and
center. You guys can flank--

2752
03:23:59,015 --> 03:24:00,355
LAURA: Flying V behind you.

2753
03:24:00,508 --> 03:24:01,667
SAM: Yes, thank you.

2754
03:24:01,667 --> 03:24:11,511
MARISHA: I catch up to Tary a little bit and I go,
hey! Are you special in some way? Is there

2755
03:24:11,511 --> 03:24:14,672
something about you that's magical and special?

2756
03:24:14,672 --> 03:24:24,505
SAM: Is this a trick question? There's everything.
Most things are special about me.

2757
03:24:24,505 --> 03:24:29,629
MARISHA: That's true. Is there a reason a vampire
would want you?

2758
03:24:29,629 --> 03:24:31,185
SAM: What? There's vampires here?

2759
03:24:31,185 --> 03:24:32,741
MARISHA: Do you have special blood?

2760
03:24:32,741 --> 03:24:35,321
SAM: No? Wait, what?

2761
03:24:35,321 --> 03:24:36,736
MARISHA: Can I look at your eyes?

2762
03:24:36,736 --> 03:24:40,267
SAM: I mean, sure? They're the bluest of blue.

2763
03:24:40,267 --> 03:24:48,214
MARISHA: That's true! Do you know anything about
your bloodline? Is there something about you? I

2764
03:24:48,214 --> 03:24:51,466
feel like I have an essence about you now.

2765
03:24:51,466 --> 03:24:54,206
TRAVIS: How much of her brains were left in the
rocks?

2766
03:24:54,206 --> 03:24:55,963
LAURA: I know, she got rattled.

2767
03:24:55,963 --> 03:24:57,769
MATT: Yeah, she's gone full Phoebe from Friends.

2768
03:24:57,769 --> 03:24:59,717
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2769
03:24:59,717 --> 03:25:04,231
LIAM: I'm off to the side with Grog going one,
two, three, shoot!

2770
03:25:04,231 --> 03:25:12,419
SAM: My town here, it doesn't have very many high
hills, but still, stay on the ground, will you?

2771
03:25:12,419 --> 03:25:15,573
MARISHA: Okay!

2772
03:25:15,573 --> 03:25:23,933
MATT: As you guys make your way into the actual
city of Deastok, the architecture here is very

2773
03:25:23,933 --> 03:25:30,499
tall and as intricate as it is old. The stonework
is edged and almost sharp in places, the shape and

2774
03:25:30,499 --> 03:25:36,419
design of most roofs and windows leaning towards
the gothic. You can see similar roots here to some

2775
03:25:36,419 --> 03:25:42,904
of Whitestone's older buildings and architecture,
common space where the original de Rolos traveled

2776
03:25:42,904 --> 03:25:52,109
once from Wildmount. The architecture here, as
opposed to the more built-for-function that a lot

2777
03:25:52,109 --> 03:26:01,204
of you are used to in Tal'Dorei, anywhere from
huts to, I want to push almost Tudor to colonial,

2778
03:26:01,204 --> 03:26:09,039
this definitely has tall stone archways, tall
stained-glass windows, in places. A lot of the

2779
03:26:09,204 --> 03:26:17,414
buildings, edges, and roofs will come to tiny
metal spires where points or occasionally flags or

2780
03:26:17,414 --> 03:26:23,344
tapestries would hang from in the wind. Very
different visual feel than anything you've seen

2781
03:26:23,344 --> 03:26:25,059
over in Tal'Dorei.

2782
03:26:25,059 --> 03:26:31,114
As you guys make your way through the streets, in
the presentational mode of which Taryon has

2783
03:26:31,114 --> 03:26:41,861
requested, people do stop and stare. You can hear
whispers, some folks pointing, some of the patrols

2784
03:26:41,861 --> 03:26:52,092
gather to keep a close eye as you pass. No
excitement, no parade, no cursing or aggression,

2785
03:26:52,092 --> 03:27:01,289
just acknowledgement of the arrival of these
strangers and a very flashy lord. Eventually, you

2786
03:27:01,289 --> 03:27:08,482
lead them to the Darrington estate. This is a
large, three-story building surrounded by tall,

2787
03:27:08,482 --> 03:27:19,981
iron pike-topped gates that surround the somewhat
octagonal shape of the grounds. The main gate is

2788
03:27:19,981 --> 03:27:25,042
watched by a single man in a simple leather outfit
and a metallic helmet. Who, as he sees you

2789
03:27:25,042 --> 03:27:32,385
approach goes, "Have you-- sir! Welcome home!"

2790
03:27:32,385 --> 03:27:37,410
SAM: Thank you. Tell the master of the house that
we've arrived.

2791
03:27:37,410 --> 03:27:42,641
MATT: "Yes. Right away, sir!" Opens the gate and
rushes off to the front door and disappears inside

2792
03:27:42,641 --> 03:27:50,484
for a moment. The door opens again, and you see
emerging from it a very tall, thin, brass-scaled

2793
03:27:50,484 --> 03:27:58,825
dragonborn with very fine clothing. His lack of
tail speaks of his Ravinite lineage. You recognize

2794
03:27:58,825 --> 03:28:07,894
this individual as Berthold; he is the servant of
the house and quarters. As he approaches he goes,

2795
03:28:07,894 --> 03:28:18,433
"Oh, Master Taryon, it has been some time! Good to
see you in good health!"

2796
03:28:18,433 --> 03:28:23,788
SAM: Yes, excellent to see you, too. You've been
keeping the grounds quite nice.

2797
03:28:23,788 --> 03:28:35,028
MATT: "We've been doing our best. I take it you--"
and he looks over to the woman K'ryyn, goes,

2798
03:28:35,028 --> 03:28:36,839
"You--"

2799
03:28:36,839 --> 03:28:40,705
"Yes, I would like to complete my contract."

2800
03:28:40,705 --> 03:28:47,717
"Very well. Please, follow me inside. This way."
The dragonborn turns around. He almost towers over

2801
03:28:47,717 --> 03:28:54,349
you; he's this spindling tree of a dragonborn. As
he leads you into the home, you watch him; he has

2802
03:28:54,349 --> 03:29:04,089
to dip down to enter the interior of the house. As
you step inside the estate, you're immediately hit

2803
03:29:04,089 --> 03:29:13,854
with the smell of musty carpets, wood oil stain,
and some since turned-to-smoke-and-embers burning

2804
03:29:13,854 --> 03:29:19,964
wood in a fireplace. You see immediately in the
darkly lit interior fine tables and well-crafted

2805
03:29:19,964 --> 03:29:26,536
furniture that clutter hallways, holding vases and
dried flowers that probably have been in long need

2806
03:29:26,536 --> 03:29:34,962
of a change. It's eerily silent. It seems, at
least on this floor, empty of pretty much all life

2807
03:29:34,962 --> 03:29:45,476
except for Berthold. He begins to walk up the
stairs. "Right this way. You know." And he heads

2808
03:29:45,476 --> 03:29:52,708
up the second flight of stairs to the very top of
the interior of the estate, and there is the very

2809
03:29:52,708 --> 03:30:02,538
heavy oak door that marks the study quarters of
your father. He knocks lightly on the door.

2810
03:30:02,538 --> 03:30:17,030
"Master Howard, you have some unexpected guests,
including the one you hired to bring your son

2811
03:30:17,030 --> 03:30:20,795
"home. And is here with your son."

2812
03:30:20,795 --> 03:30:31,814
There's a pause. You hear a voice on the other
side say, "Let them enter." The door creaks open.

2813
03:30:31,814 --> 03:30:33,998
(creak)

2814
03:30:33,998 --> 03:30:42,757
Berthold steps back. "I'll wait here." He bows and
gestures for you all to step into the room.

2815
03:30:42,819 --> 03:30:54,657
As you guys step into this study you see, standing
right across from you, looking into the fireplace,

2816
03:30:54,657 --> 03:31:02,640
you occasionally hear the crack and the snap of
what looks to be a halfway burned fire. A human

2817
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:10,365
man in his late forties. His short blond hair is
receding to the top of his head. You can see the

2818
03:31:10,365 --> 03:31:19,465
firelight glistening across his somewhat oily
forehead, and two heavy sideburns that are an

2819
03:31:19,465 --> 03:31:25,037
uncombed mass that frame the sides of his very
hardened square jaw. He is dressed in a nobleman's

2820
03:31:25,037 --> 03:31:33,012
coat and breeches, though his shoes are nowhere to
be seen. Just barefoot on the ground. He looks

2821
03:31:33,012 --> 03:31:42,295
over and sees you enter and looks towards Taryon
and his hardened face turns to a softened smile.

2822
03:31:42,295 --> 03:31:46,791
"My son."

2823
03:31:46,791 --> 03:31:48,646
SAM: Papa.

2824
03:31:48,646 --> 03:32:00,817
MATT: He looks over to the woman, K'ryyn. "What
I've heard is true, and I thank you for your time.

2825
03:32:00,817 --> 03:32:08,918
"Berthold will see that you are paid." She nods.
There is a nod to you.

2826
03:32:08,918 --> 03:32:15,904
SAM: You'll wait for us outside the grounds, and
we'll give you your next assignment soon.

2827
03:32:15,904 --> 03:32:21,531
MATT: "That is the arrangement." She leaves the
room and you hear Berthold walking alongside her

2828
03:32:21,531 --> 03:32:24,013
and chatting with her about payment as she
leaves.

2829
03:32:24,013 --> 03:32:29,670
As soon as they walk down the stairs he turns and
goes, "I am glad to see you are well."

2830
03:32:29,670 --> 03:32:37,201
SAM: Are you? You sent that woman to kidnap me.

2831
03:32:37,201 --> 03:32:41,162
MATT: "I sent that woman to bring you home. To see
that you were safe."

2832
03:32:41,162 --> 03:32:48,043
SAM: She bound and gagged me and threw me on the
back of a horse. That's how you brought me home?

2833
03:32:48,043 --> 03:32:54,241
MATT: "You're a hard man to find when you want to
be."

2834
03:32:54,241 --> 03:33:01,609
SAM: I am literally the least hard man to find. I
tell everyone my name, I wear a gold helmet, and I

2835
03:33:01,609 --> 03:33:03,916
walk around talking about myself.

2836
03:33:03,916 --> 03:33:15,929
MATT: His smile fades for a moment. "And yet you
were very far from these lands."

2837
03:33:15,929 --> 03:33:24,970
SAM: Yes, I was. I was living a new life, as I
told you I would. I was finding myself and

2838
03:33:24,970 --> 03:33:26,988
becoming someone.

2839
03:33:26,988 --> 03:33:39,215
MATT: "That is good. Just know that I was worried.
You fill your head with these fantasies and ideals

2840
03:33:39,215 --> 03:33:48,373
"and step out into the unknown. Do you know how
many men and women are found gutted in the streets

2841
03:33:48,373 --> 03:33:55,812
"and left and abandoned to rot away in forests by
some bandits on the roadside? Not to mention the

2842
03:33:55,812 --> 03:34:00,103
"various beasts of the wild out there. I was
worried about you."

2843
03:34:00,103 --> 03:34:11,917
SAM: Well, I was in danger for much of my time
away, but that's not a bad thing, sometimes.

2844
03:34:11,917 --> 03:34:23,505
Becoming an adventurer or whatever I am now, it
wasn't supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be

2845
03:34:23,505 --> 03:34:33,957
hard, and it was, and it had risks. But along the
way, I did much, and I stand before you now as a

2846
03:34:33,957 --> 03:34:46,054
different man than who left. One who has been
through a lot and knows the dangers of the world,

2847
03:34:46,054 --> 03:34:59,794
but is also a survivor. You know, when I left, I
told you I was going to prove myself to you. That

2848
03:34:59,794 --> 03:35:08,718
I would bring you back stories of my exploits and
show you what kind of a man I really was. And I

2849
03:35:08,718 --> 03:35:19,468
wrote a lot of them down in a book, but I don't
think I want to show it to you, because I don't

2850
03:35:19,468 --> 03:35:29,978
think you deserve to see it. You never supported
me as a child, and you don't now. Financially,

2851
03:35:30,144 --> 03:35:42,774
yes, but not as a father. And the things I did
while I was away-- well, the book is a diary now.

2852
03:35:42,774 --> 03:35:45,051
It's for me, not for you.

2853
03:35:45,051 --> 03:36:09,199
MATT: "Taryon... while my parenting may have
been strict or distant at times, I didn't reflect

2854
03:36:09,199 --> 03:36:17,921
"on my care for you. We have a legacy in
this family to maintain."

2855
03:36:18,032 --> 03:36:21,426
SAM: Yes, I know. That's all you seem to care
about.

2856
03:36:21,426 --> 03:36:25,115
MATT: "That's all that matters."

2857
03:36:25,115 --> 03:36:29,913
SAM: It's not all that matters. I know that I
carry your blood and that means a lot to you.

2858
03:36:29,913 --> 03:36:35,062
MATT: "This money that you seem to relish in,
that you took without asking, the last of our

2859
03:36:35,062 --> 03:36:53,644
"coffers. Your grandfather started this, and I've
done everything to maintain it. And your

2860
03:36:53,644 --> 03:37:04,166
"interests, your attention, could not be brought to
learn and maintain this business after me, so I've

2861
03:37:04,166 --> 03:37:14,440
"had to turn to Maryanne. It's not that I don't
love you, but you have another purpose in this

2862
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:19,112
"family. And that is why I've brought you here."

2863
03:37:19,154 --> 03:37:21,545
SAM: And what is that?

2864
03:37:21,545 --> 03:37:26,850
MATT: And you watch as his hands are shaking and
he's fidgeting and scratching his chin and running

2865
03:37:26,850 --> 03:37:56,966
his fingers through his sideburns. "We're
impoverished. I haven't been able to pay our staff

2866
03:37:56,966 --> 03:38:21,920
"in nearly two months. Everything that I had to do
to maintain this legacy has come back to bear

2867
03:38:21,920 --> 03:38:29,581
"fruit, and the debt that we owe is vast."

2868
03:38:29,581 --> 03:38:36,655
SAM: I don't believe you. Where's the money?
Where's the family money?

2869
03:38:36,655 --> 03:38:45,865
MATT: He looks around at the rest of you, and you
can see now there is trepidation with having this

2870
03:38:45,865 --> 03:38:48,279
conversation in front of strangers.

2871
03:38:48,340 --> 03:38:51,414
SAM: It's all right. They're with me.

2872
03:38:51,414 --> 03:39:01,797
MATT: He reaches over and grabs off his desk an
already opened bottle of some sort of wine. Takes

2873
03:39:01,797 --> 03:39:10,188
a quick swig and sets it down. Slumps into his
chair in front of the fire and rests his face on

2874
03:39:10,188 --> 03:39:29,541
his hand. "Everything your grandfather Oberon
built, it's on the verge of fading away. All the

2875
03:39:29,541 --> 03:39:39,844
"taxes we claim on our lands now go straight to a
syndicate that we owe a lot of money to. Unless

2876
03:39:39,844 --> 03:39:45,029
"we find a way to pay off the debts of your father
and his father before him, we will all be thrown

2877
03:39:45,029 --> 03:39:51,672
"into the cold or worse. Now, I've seen this storm
coming for a while, Taryon. I've spent years

2878
03:39:51,672 --> 03:40:02,227
"trying to coax a family union with the Truscans;
you know this. After much toil and diplomacy, they

2879
03:40:02,227 --> 03:40:09,058
"have agreed to wed you to their daughter Lydia.
This union will bring our family a renewed avenue

2880
03:40:09,058 --> 03:40:16,971
"to wealth and protection within the empire! We can
stave off this terrible end, and you will be a

2881
03:40:16,971 --> 03:40:24,546
"hero within the family."

2882
03:40:24,546 --> 03:40:31,044
SAM: I don't understand. The way we lived, the way
you talked, made it seem like there was endless

2883
03:40:31,044 --> 03:40:33,468
money, forever.

2884
03:40:33,468 --> 03:40:36,865
MATT: "This stems to your lack of respect."

2885
03:40:36,865 --> 03:40:45,422
SAM: <i>My</i> lack of respect? What happened? How did
you ruin us like this?

2886
03:40:45,422 --> 03:40:48,634
LAURA: What is this syndicate you speak of?

2887
03:40:48,634 --> 03:41:03,027
MATT: His eyes dart to you with a fiery hatred,
like how dare you speak up right now. "When your

2888
03:41:03,027 --> 03:41:10,614
"grandfather passed, when you were still but a
baby, our lands were nearly taken from us by a

2889
03:41:10,614 --> 03:41:20,082
"rival barony from within the Dwendalian court.
Lord Jaipher found loopholes to revoking our

2890
03:41:20,082 --> 03:41:31,042
"ownership and titles set by Oberon and in my panic
and necessity, I found an ally in the Myriad."

2891
03:41:31,080 --> 03:41:33,749
SAM: In the Myriad?

2892
03:41:33,749 --> 03:41:43,658
MATT: "Through a whispered hint, I met a man named
Korshad, who ensured our surviving ownership in

2893
03:41:43,658 --> 03:41:54,198
"trade for a partnership with him. I signed, not
wanting to toss, at the time, my only child

2894
03:41:54,198 --> 03:42:05,158
"onto the street. But as the decades passed, I did
not realize in my haste, the depths of the deal

2895
03:42:05,158 --> 03:42:12,044
"that I had made. And with many harvests failing in
recent years, the agreement now devours our

2896
03:42:12,044 --> 03:42:20,517
"livelihood from within. They now demand our
accrued debt paid in full or they take full

2897
03:42:20,517 --> 03:42:22,718
"ownership of everything."

2898
03:42:22,718 --> 03:42:36,787
SAM: I'm having trouble wrapping my head around
this. You're saying everything I've lived has all

2899
03:42:36,787 --> 03:42:47,246
been built on this deal with this shady group?
You're a criminal? You're just a criminal.

2900
03:42:47,246 --> 03:42:50,672
MATT: "No. No, it is built on what we built as a
family."

2901
03:42:50,672 --> 03:42:53,074
SAM: We didn't build anything as a family!

2902
03:42:53,074 --> 03:42:59,538
MATT: "We did, and nearly had it taken away. I did
this to maintain it. And I let you live as you all

2903
03:42:59,538 --> 03:43:01,523
"deserved to live."

2904
03:43:01,523 --> 03:43:15,857
SAM: But Papa, you never told me any of this. You
were cold to us, and you told us a bare minimum of

2905
03:43:15,857 --> 03:43:18,623
what you did and how you ran things.

2906
03:43:18,623 --> 03:43:26,914
MATT: "I hoped to find a way to fix this before I
needed to, yet here I am, prostrate before my own

2907
03:43:26,914 --> 03:43:33,534
"child. Broken." And he starts, like, tears just
pour down his cheeks. "I was just trying to make

2908
03:43:33,534 --> 03:43:35,438
"it right."

2909
03:43:35,438 --> 03:43:44,497
SAM: I didn't know any of this. How would I? And
now I have to fix it for you

2910
03:43:44,497 --> 03:43:48,366
by marrying some girl?

2911
03:43:48,366 --> 03:43:51,346
MATT: "It's a marriage of convenience."

2912
03:43:51,346 --> 03:43:53,146
SAM: That's still a marriage.

2913
03:43:53,146 --> 03:43:58,383
MATT: "It means nothing more than political gain.
Your life is still yours to live."

2914
03:43:58,383 --> 03:44:04,852
SAM: No, it's not! I have to be here, I have to be
with her. I have to live in her castle or she in

2915
03:44:04,852 --> 03:44:17,754
mine. (sighs) Listen, I've learned a lot from
these people over the last year or so. And one

2916
03:44:17,754 --> 03:44:31,779
thing I've learned is that you are who you are
whether you have a lot of money or not. And I

2917
03:44:31,779 --> 03:44:39,713
don't have that much anymore and I'm still okay
with that. And it's not because of the things I

2918
03:44:39,713 --> 03:44:48,897
own, it's because of the deeds that I do. You've
done some bad deeds in your life, and it sounds

2919
03:44:48,897 --> 03:44:54,744
like you've done them to preserve our family and
preserve our legacy, but that's

2920
03:44:54,744 --> 03:44:56,566
not a reason to do them.

2921
03:44:56,566 --> 03:45:02,192
MATT: He leans forward to you and looks to you
with an honest, more honest than you've seen him,

2922
03:45:02,192 --> 03:45:14,351
very vulnerable expression. "Every man and woman
who has money has done bad things."

2923
03:45:14,351 --> 03:45:31,566
SAM: Yes, I'm sure that's true. And I assume I'm
somehow complicit in this.

2924
03:45:31,566 --> 03:45:41,827
MATT: "You are not. I tried to keep you, your
sister, and your mother as innocent as I could. My

2925
03:45:41,827 --> 03:45:44,185
"back is to a wall now."

2926
03:45:44,185 --> 03:45:49,337
SAM: I'll have to think about this.

2927
03:45:49,337 --> 03:45:56,407
MATT: "Think on it. The choice is still yours; I
would not force you into this, but it is a chance

2928
03:45:56,407 --> 03:45:59,967
"I wish you to contemplate."

2929
03:45:59,967 --> 03:46:07,844
SAM: What have you done to our name? Do people
know of this?

2930
03:46:07,844 --> 03:46:09,105
MATT: "No."

2931
03:46:09,105 --> 03:46:16,620
SAM: And if I marry this girl, it will just all go
away?

2932
03:46:16,620 --> 03:46:28,883
MATT: "If you marry this girl, we will have the
influence and the wealth to pay this debt and cut

2933
03:46:28,883 --> 03:46:35,526
"ties with the Myriad entirely. We would be a free
family once more."

2934
03:46:35,526 --> 03:46:39,865
LAURA: How much debt are we talking?

2935
03:46:39,865 --> 03:46:52,449
MATT: "The last amount we were given: 230,000
gold."

2936
03:46:52,449 --> 03:46:57,981
LAURA: Well. That's a lot.

2937
03:46:57,981 --> 03:47:04,823
ASHLEY: Is there any other way than marriage that
you can think of?

2938
03:47:04,823 --> 03:47:13,339
MATT: "I've exhausted the options I have at my
disposal."

2939
03:47:13,339 --> 03:47:15,726
LAURA: What if we just wipe out the Myriad?

2940
03:47:15,726 --> 03:47:17,601
MATT: He laughs.

2941
03:47:17,601 --> 03:47:19,305
SAM: They're far too big.

2942
03:47:19,305 --> 03:47:34,836
MATT: "You underestimate the sheer size and how
ingrained they are in the society here. This is no

2943
03:47:34,836 --> 03:47:42,376
"guild. Wildmount <i>is</i> the Myriad in many ways."

2944
03:47:42,376 --> 03:47:51,559
SAM: And if I say no and they take all of our
possessions and our estate, everything, what then?

2945
03:47:51,559 --> 03:47:54,163
We're ruined.

2946
03:47:54,163 --> 03:48:04,645
MATT: "We're on the street. We are but beggars
within our own city, at the mercy of those we've

2947
03:48:04,645 --> 03:48:06,262
"been taxing."

2948
03:48:06,262 --> 03:48:15,621
SAM: How could you do this to us?

2949
03:48:15,621 --> 03:48:25,765
MATT: "Because I loved you. I loved you all, and I
did what was necessary."

2950
03:48:25,765 --> 03:48:35,101
SAM: You never told us that. You always talked
about bloodlines and legacies and the Darrington

2951
03:48:35,101 --> 03:48:48,554
name. But you never told us you were proud. You
never comforted us. You never cared what I wanted

2952
03:48:48,554 --> 03:49:00,613
to do or who I wanted to be. I'm cursed with this
name now, Darrington. You've sullied our name by

2953
03:49:00,613 --> 03:49:12,449
enforcing these taxes and just being an asshole to
everyone around our whole city, and now I have to

2954
03:49:12,449 --> 03:49:26,185
live with it or marry this girl to save it.
Listen, I'm sorry I left, and I'm sorry I took all

2955
03:49:26,185 --> 03:49:41,622
of that gold. I did not know it was everything.
But what you're asking me is-- I'll need to think.

2956
03:49:41,622 --> 03:49:43,096
I'm sorry.

2957
03:49:43,096 --> 03:49:56,606
MATT: "I owe you that, at least. I never claimed
to be a good man. I never claimed to be a good

2958
03:49:56,606 --> 03:50:10,409
"father, good husband, but I can try to be better,
can't I?"

2959
03:50:10,409 --> 03:50:27,797
SAM: Yes, you can. I'm going to go see Mother and
Sister. Might my friends stay here the night?

2960
03:50:27,797 --> 03:50:34,814
MATT: "Of course, and enjoy the grounds while you
can."

2961
03:50:34,814 --> 03:50:40,612
LAURA: This Korshad, and the Myriad, where do you
meet with him?

2962
03:50:40,612 --> 03:51:03,566
MATT: "It's been some time, but if you wish to
seek him out, ask for who you can speak with the

2963
03:51:03,566 --> 03:51:11,835
"Many, in the Grumpy Lily."

2964
03:51:11,835 --> 03:51:13,937
SAM: Grumpy Lillian?

2965
03:51:13,937 --> 03:51:22,122
MATT: The Grumpy Lily. You know this to be one of
the seedier bars in town.

2966
03:51:22,122 --> 03:51:23,504
SAM: Oh, okay.

2967
03:51:23,504 --> 03:51:28,559
LAURA: And I'm asking to speak with the Many?

2968
03:51:28,559 --> 03:51:30,504
MATT: You're wishing to speak with the Many.

2969
03:51:30,504 --> 03:51:31,560
LAURA: All right.

2970
03:51:31,560 --> 03:51:42,442
SAM: Well, good to see you. Have a good
afternoon.

2971
03:51:42,442 --> 03:51:45,179
MATT: "I'm glad you're safe."

2972
03:51:45,179 --> 03:51:51,025
SAM: Thank you. It's good to see you again.

2973
03:51:51,069 --> 03:52:02,738
MATT: "You too. More than you know, my son."

2974
03:52:02,795 --> 03:52:04,013
LAURA: Do we leave the room?

2975
03:52:04,085 --> 03:52:06,140
SAM: Yes, let's leave the room.

2976
03:52:06,140 --> 03:52:07,534
LIAM: We could have cut that air with a knife.

2977
03:52:07,534 --> 03:52:10,241
LAURA: So here's the thing, though. You said he
like hated you, and he didn't seem like he hated

2978
03:52:10,241 --> 03:52:11,368
you at all!

2979
03:52:11,368 --> 03:52:17,419
SAM: He's acting differently than I recall. It's
been a while. I'm not used to seeing him like

2980
03:52:17,419 --> 03:52:20,648
this, and honestly, I don't know how to take it.

2981
03:52:20,648 --> 03:52:22,285
LAURA: Well, you can't marry that bitch.

2982
03:52:22,285 --> 03:52:23,795
ASHLEY: You can't marry her.

2983
03:52:23,795 --> 03:52:25,181
SAM: It seems like I have to.

2984
03:52:25,181 --> 03:52:26,462
LAURA and ASHLEY: No, you don't.

2985
03:52:26,462 --> 03:52:28,059
TRAVIS: Got to do it.

2986
03:52:28,059 --> 03:52:29,546
SAM: Grog says I do.

2987
03:52:29,546 --> 03:52:30,456
LAURA: Grog.

2988
03:52:30,456 --> 03:52:35,420
TRAVIS: Simplest. The shortest distance between
two--

2989
03:52:35,466 --> 03:52:36,463
ASHLEY: Two points.

2990
03:52:36,463 --> 03:52:37,778
TRAVIS: Yep. Is--

2991
03:52:37,778 --> 03:52:38,749
SAM: Marriage.

2992
03:52:38,749 --> 03:52:41,246
TRAVIS: Marriage. Yep.

2993
03:52:41,246 --> 03:52:43,423
LAURA: You're getting so smart, Grog! So smart.

2994
03:52:43,423 --> 03:52:44,747
TRAVIS: Don't be jealous.

2995
03:52:44,747 --> 03:52:46,661
LIAM: I know some about the Myriad, correct?

2996
03:52:46,661 --> 03:52:51,707
MATT: You've encountered them once. Back in
Stillben, back at the very beginning of your

2997
03:52:51,707 --> 03:52:54,934
adventures. The very beginning.

2998
03:52:54,934 --> 03:52:57,603
TALIESIN: Not me.

2999
03:52:57,603 --> 03:53:01,157
MATT: Percy, this is the first you've heard.

3000
03:53:01,157 --> 03:53:02,775
MARISHA: Wait, you?

3001
03:53:02,775 --> 03:53:08,112
LAURA: He wasn't with us yet. We had that other
guy he was playing.

3002
03:53:08,112 --> 03:53:11,465
(laughter)

3003
03:53:11,465 --> 03:53:13,353
LIAM: Rusty. Rusty Trombone?

3004
03:53:13,353 --> 03:53:14,598
TALIESIN: Rusty Trombone.

3005
03:53:14,598 --> 03:53:16,274
SAM: He was a weird character choice.

3006
03:53:16,274 --> 03:53:20,748
MATT: That's a good name for an artificer.

3007
03:53:20,748 --> 03:53:24,926
(laughter)

3008
03:53:24,926 --> 03:53:30,311
MATT: As you exit the study and close the door
behind you, left in the cold, quiet silence of the

3009
03:53:30,311 --> 03:53:33,770
house, you continue your conversation.

3010
03:53:33,804 --> 03:53:36,247
TALIESIN: Where is your sister?

3011
03:53:36,247 --> 03:53:38,375
SAM: I don't know.

3012
03:53:38,375 --> 03:53:41,656
LAURA: How much money did you take when you left?

3013
03:53:41,656 --> 03:53:45,301
SAM: I thought a meager amount. 50,000 gold.

3014
03:53:45,301 --> 03:53:47,462
MARISHA: That's a lot.

3015
03:53:47,462 --> 03:53:50,527
LAURA: But, I mean, considering the debt that
they're in.

3016
03:53:50,527 --> 03:53:54,873
MARISHA: That's literally more than my entire
tribe owns.

3017
03:53:54,921 --> 03:53:57,945
LAURA: Well, we have a lot more than that in our
party fund.

3018
03:53:57,945 --> 03:54:01,615
MARISHA: I know. We own more than my tribe owns.

3019
03:54:01,615 --> 03:54:03,424
TALIESIN: I own more than your tribe owns.

3020
03:54:03,424 --> 03:54:10,545
MARISHA: I know. I will say, Tary, I think
you are special. You have very large dangling bits.

3021
03:54:10,694 --> 03:54:15,856
Along with your earring. Very large other bits.

3022
03:54:15,856 --> 03:54:17,204
SAM: Thank you.

3023
03:54:17,204 --> 03:54:20,612
TALIESIN: We were working on that particular
compliment, and I feel like we have a little way

3024
03:54:20,612 --> 03:54:21,509
to go.

3025
03:54:21,509 --> 03:54:24,948
MARISHA: Is it all right? No? I thought
that was a compliment.

3026
03:54:25,104 --> 03:54:26,853
SAM: Tell her she did good.

3027
03:54:26,853 --> 03:54:28,863
TRAVIS: Are you cool with your sister?

3028
03:54:28,863 --> 03:54:32,194
SAM: No. I'm not cool with my sister. She's not
that great.

3029
03:54:32,194 --> 03:54:33,929
TRAVIS: Is she married?

3030
03:54:33,929 --> 03:54:35,756
TALIESIN: Do you think she knows about this?

3031
03:54:35,756 --> 03:54:38,943
SAM: I guess. I suppose she knows about this.

3032
03:54:38,943 --> 03:54:42,068
MARISHA: And the last time you spoke with her was
when you left, I'm assuming?

3033
03:54:42,068 --> 03:54:50,649
SAM: Yes, that's right. She was being groomed as the
heir to the family, and I was being shut out. My

3034
03:54:50,649 --> 03:54:54,203
mother is here somewhere, too. She's pretty
quiet.

3035
03:54:54,203 --> 03:54:56,086
TALIESIN: What do you want to do?

3036
03:54:56,086 --> 03:55:04,184
SAM: I guess talk to them, but we can't go after
the Myriad; they're powerful and dark.

3037
03:55:04,184 --> 03:55:08,296
TRAVIS: What if we offer services, and they excuse
part of the debt?

3038
03:55:08,296 --> 03:55:11,290
SAM: No, he offered services, and look where it
got him.

3039
03:55:11,290 --> 03:55:13,176
ASHLEY: Do you know Lydia?

3040
03:55:13,176 --> 03:55:17,746
MATT: You've never met Lydia in your life. You
don't even know what she looks like.

3041
03:55:17,746 --> 03:55:22,926
TALIESIN: I'm not even sure if that's something
that should be entertained.

3042
03:55:22,926 --> 03:55:32,487
SAM: We could go talk to them, but I don't see how
that's going to change anything.

3043
03:55:32,487 --> 03:55:37,080
LAURA: Maybe she's a really cool girl that won't
be into you and you can just hang out and be

3044
03:55:37,080 --> 03:55:38,381
besties?

3045
03:55:38,381 --> 03:55:40,102
SAM: Gross.

3046
03:55:40,102 --> 03:55:41,617
LAURA: Hey!

3047
03:55:41,617 --> 03:55:44,708
SAM: No. I like being besties with you. I don't
want some rando.

3048
03:55:44,708 --> 03:55:49,676
TALIESIN: It's not fair to her, either.

3049
03:55:49,676 --> 03:55:54,495
MARISHA: It's not. Honestly, maybe we should just
go talk to her first.

3050
03:55:54,495 --> 03:55:55,885
SAM: Lydia?

3051
03:55:55,885 --> 03:55:57,724
LAURA: No, she's in a whole other town.

3052
03:55:57,724 --> 03:56:01,807
ASHLEY: Here's the thing, you're not going to
marry her. Okay?

3053
03:56:01,807 --> 03:56:02,827
SAM: Why not?

3054
03:56:02,827 --> 03:56:08,549
ASHLEY: Because if he wants to be a better father
to you, then he's going to let this go and not

3055
03:56:08,549 --> 03:56:12,451
let you do this. If that means him being out on
the street, that's my opinion.

3056
03:56:12,505 --> 03:56:14,047
TRAVIS: That's harsh.

3057
03:56:14,047 --> 03:56:22,174
SAM: Everything he is, is his status, though. This
place, where he lives, his servants. If he's got

3058
03:56:22,174 --> 03:56:25,570
nothing, then he's just... he'll die.

3059
03:56:25,570 --> 03:56:31,232
ASHLEY: Sometimes, when you let that go, only then
are you able to truly live.

3060
03:56:31,232 --> 03:56:33,939
TRAVIS: Whoa.

3061
03:56:33,939 --> 03:56:35,409
LAURA: Deep.

3062
03:56:35,409 --> 03:56:42,461
SAM: That is maybe true, but listen. I've been
working on this for a year, and I'm starting to

3063
03:56:42,461 --> 03:56:47,603
get really nervous. I'm down to my last few bits
of gold, and I don't know how that would feel to

3064
03:56:47,603 --> 03:56:48,439
run out.

3065
03:56:48,439 --> 03:56:51,207
ASHLEY: I don't even have any money.

3066
03:56:51,207 --> 03:56:53,131
LAURA: Because you gave it all away.

3067
03:56:53,131 --> 03:56:54,818
TRAVIS: Technically, I've got a lot of money.

3068
03:56:54,818 --> 03:56:57,950
ASHLEY: Money gives you everything you want.

3069
03:56:57,950 --> 03:56:59,477
LAURA: It's the best thing.

3070
03:56:59,477 --> 03:57:01,282
MARISHA: Hey, but you're thrifty. You're good.

3071
03:57:01,282 --> 03:57:02,553
SAM: No, I'm not thrifty.

3072
03:57:02,553 --> 03:57:10,361
MARISHA: Yes, you are! Taryon, I've seen make
amazing things. You can survive. You've been to

3073
03:57:10,361 --> 03:57:16,645
the depths of the watery abyss. And you've lived,
kind of.

3074
03:57:16,645 --> 03:57:18,987
TALIESIN: That's a bad example.

3075
03:57:18,987 --> 03:57:23,746
LAURA: I'm really wishing we had taken a lot more
money from Thordak. If we had taken more money,

3076
03:57:23,746 --> 03:57:25,276
everything would be fine right now.

3077
03:57:25,276 --> 03:57:28,264
MARISHA: No! That's not the lesson of the story,
you guys!

3078
03:57:28,264 --> 03:57:29,975
SAM: Yes, money would have solved this.

3079
03:57:29,975 --> 03:57:34,796
MARISHA: No! Not the lesson, not the lesson we're
supposed to take away!

3080
03:57:34,796 --> 03:57:40,644
TALIESIN: No, I mean he's right that money would
have solved this. But that's not the lesson.

3081
03:57:40,644 --> 03:57:42,747
Keyleth is right.

3082
03:57:42,747 --> 03:57:48,876
MARISHA: I don't have an alternative for the
lesson. It's just not the lesson.

3083
03:57:48,876 --> 03:57:54,394
TALIESIN: We're here. We can figure out a way out
of this. We're smart, we're clever, we're

3084
03:57:54,394 --> 03:57:58,385
powerful. And what's one more cliff?

3085
03:57:58,385 --> 03:57:59,635
MARISHA: Yeah, we're gods!

3086
03:57:59,635 --> 03:58:01,079
TALIESIN: Not again.

3087
03:58:01,079 --> 03:58:03,385
TRAVIS: Not going to say that ever again.

3088
03:58:03,385 --> 03:58:06,625
ASHLEY: I say we go talk to the Many.

3089
03:58:06,625 --> 03:58:08,471
LAURA: Yes, let's go talk to the Many.

3090
03:58:08,471 --> 03:58:14,516
LIAM: I understand this is very complicated. Are
we really looking for a solution to fix several

3091
03:58:14,516 --> 03:58:24,815
generations of your family's misdeeds? It sounds
like your father, your grandfather have been

3092
03:58:24,815 --> 03:58:29,963
navigating murky waters for some time.

3093
03:58:29,963 --> 03:58:32,758
TALIESIN: I want to find out what your sister
knows.

3094
03:58:32,758 --> 03:58:38,215
LIAM: I don't know what the right decision is,
either. Do you marry this woman to fix decades of

3095
03:58:38,215 --> 03:58:41,206
terrible decisions?

3096
03:58:41,206 --> 03:58:47,911
TALIESIN: I don't necessarily see how two wrongs
right anything here. It's just really kicking the

3097
03:58:47,911 --> 03:58:52,587
ball down the road while you make another random
human being you have not met miserable.

3098
03:58:52,587 --> 03:58:53,723
LAURA: That's right.

3099
03:58:53,723 --> 03:58:56,885
SAM: I assume I would be a fine husband.

3100
03:58:56,885 --> 03:58:58,286
LAURA: You'd be amazing.

3101
03:58:58,286 --> 03:58:59,851
SAM: I feel like I'd be okay.

3102
03:58:59,851 --> 03:59:05,292
LIAM: You make really good blondies, and
many things besides blondies, as well.

3103
03:59:05,292 --> 03:59:09,188
TALIESIN: Oh, this is so depressing. I'm not going
to even pretend that this is true. Absolutely not.

3104
03:59:09,234 --> 03:59:14,628
No. You'll be miserable, and that will make her
miserable.

3105
03:59:14,628 --> 03:59:17,058
SAM: Yes, it's true.

3106
03:59:17,058 --> 03:59:24,680
LIAM: So if we know that that's not happening,
then we deal with the problem that is left behind.

3107
03:59:24,680 --> 03:59:31,250
Which is: do we worry about your family's life,
their safety? Are they safe here, or are

3108
03:59:31,250 --> 03:59:34,939
they gonna be eaten alive?

3109
03:59:34,994 --> 03:59:41,762
SAM: I'd assume they are not safe here. We'd have
to convince them to leave, or protect them

3110
03:59:41,826 --> 03:59:47,594
somehow, or make a deal to at least protect them
in poverty.

3111
03:59:47,594 --> 03:59:55,315
LAURA: Maybe we just talk to the Myriad, talk to
Korshad and see what we can do. Maybe he needs

3112
03:59:55,315 --> 03:59:57,681
something, and we can provide it.

3113
03:59:57,681 --> 04:00:04,841
TALIESIN: We are bad news for anybody like that.
I'm sure it would be worth their time to get us

3114
04:00:04,841 --> 04:00:09,667
out of town, possibly get you out of town. You
can't be good for business.

3115
04:00:09,667 --> 04:00:17,966
SAM: All right. Well, a quick stop to talk to my
sister, possibly, and then let's go at least

3116
04:00:17,966 --> 04:00:20,326
investigate this contact.

3117
04:00:20,371 --> 04:00:22,026
LIAM: God, this sucks.

3118
04:00:22,026 --> 04:00:29,021
SAM: I appreciate you all being here for me. I'm
sorry. I didn't realize that this was going to

3119
04:00:29,021 --> 04:00:35,707
happen and I don't want-- if you fellows want to
go back and just continue on, I can solve this.

3120
04:00:35,707 --> 04:00:38,806
LIAM: Nah, man! You're one of us now!

3121
04:00:38,806 --> 04:00:44,503
LAURA: Just next time you get abducted by a bounty
hunter, give us some warning, would you?

3122
04:00:44,503 --> 04:00:49,216
SAM: I'll try. Maybe I should sleep with bells
on.

3123
04:00:49,216 --> 04:00:50,922
LAURA: That would be a good idea.

3124
04:00:50,922 --> 04:00:52,623
LIAM: You're halfway there.

3125
04:00:52,623 --> 04:00:55,206
SAM: Percy, can you make me some?

3126
04:00:55,206 --> 04:01:00,501
TALIESIN: Some bells? Absolutely. I'm going to
regret this, but yes.

3127
04:01:00,501 --> 04:01:04,502
TRAVIS: Don't do it, man. They tried to make me wear bells.
Don't let them hold you down.

3128
04:01:04,562 --> 04:01:05,710
LAURA: I thought you liked that hat.

3129
04:01:05,757 --> 04:01:08,714
TALIESIN: I like that you approve of the arranged
marriage, but it's the bells that really--

3130
04:01:08,714 --> 04:01:11,940
TRAVIS: Yeah, you don't get to keep eyes on me all
hours of the day.

3131
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:19,588
SAM: All right, I'll walk through the place and look for
sis.

3132
04:01:19,628 --> 04:01:28,760
MATT: Okay, and we'll pick up there next week, as
it is 11:00, we'll pick this up.

3133
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:30,455
LAURA: Your dad is not what I expected!

3134
04:01:30,455 --> 04:01:31,304
ASHLEY: No!

3135
04:01:31,304 --> 04:01:32,772
SAM: (singing) Me, neither!

3136
04:01:32,772 --> 04:01:34,444
LAURA: Ugh!

3137
04:01:34,444 --> 04:01:36,277
SAM: Mercer!

3138
04:01:36,277 --> 04:01:37,879
LAURA: Matthew Mercer.

3139
04:01:37,879 --> 04:01:38,927
MATT: What?

3140
04:01:38,927 --> 04:01:44,763
LAURA: You have a way of taking our backstories
that we think we've created and then just flipping

3141
04:01:44,763 --> 04:01:45,986
it on us.

3142
04:01:45,986 --> 04:01:49,640
TALIESIN: Nothing happened.

3143
04:01:49,640 --> 04:01:51,792
SAM: No, Grog jumped off a roof and died.

3144
04:01:51,792 --> 04:01:54,519
MARISHA: Was it 1,000 feet? Yeah, all right.

3145
04:01:54,572 --> 04:01:59,153
LIAM: He actually can take that much damage,
though.

3146
04:01:59,216 --> 04:02:01,100
MARISHA: 360 points?

3147
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:04,436
TRAVIS: Yeah, raging, reduced to half. Yep.

3148
04:02:04,436 --> 04:02:08,836
MARISHA: Technically, I don't think falling damage
counts as weapon damage. I don't know if you can

3149
04:02:08,836 --> 04:02:09,672
take half damage.

3150
04:02:09,672 --> 04:02:11,065
MATT: Well, bludgeoning, it would.

3151
04:02:11,065 --> 04:02:12,071
TALIESIN: Bludgeoning.

3152
04:02:12,071 --> 04:02:13,548
LAURA: Damn it! (laughs)

3153
04:02:13,548 --> 04:02:15,983
MARISHA: Oh, half damage.

3154
04:02:15,983 --> 04:02:18,916
LAURA: How many hit points do you have?

3155
04:02:18,916 --> 04:02:20,037
TRAVIS: A lot.

3156
04:02:20,037 --> 04:02:24,289
TALIESIN: He doesn't like to brag.

3157
04:02:24,289 --> 04:02:29,636
MATT: Awesome, guys. We'll see how this goes.

3158
04:02:29,636 --> 04:02:36,441
TRAVIS: There's not a lot of real sound family
structures in this campaign.

3159
04:02:36,441 --> 04:02:39,344
ASHLEY: We all have such terrible families.

3160
04:02:39,344 --> 04:02:41,338
LAURA: We all have shitty families.

3161
04:02:41,338 --> 04:02:44,672
TRAVIS: Let this be a lesson.

3162
04:02:44,672 --> 04:02:46,342
LIAM: Mom was great.

3163
04:02:46,342 --> 04:02:48,024
LAURA: Yeah, Mom was real great.

3164
04:02:48,024 --> 04:02:49,431
LIAM: She was the best.

3165
04:02:49,431 --> 04:02:54,300
TALIESIN: Every fucking moment of my backstory,
man. I'm so excited for this shit.

3166
04:02:54,300 --> 04:02:56,566
MATT: Yeah.

3167
04:02:56,566 --> 04:02:57,956
TALIESIN: Bonus backstory.

3168
04:02:57,956 --> 04:03:02,350
MATT: You guys keep creating-- you act like you
didn't hand me backstories with traumatic

3169
04:03:02,350 --> 04:03:04,677
relationships with your parents already.

3170
04:03:04,677 --> 04:03:06,766
TRAVIS: You're so dark, man. Why do you make this
shit up?

3171
04:03:06,766 --> 04:03:08,277
LIAM: It was years ago!

3172
04:03:08,277 --> 04:03:11,539
TALIESIN: One fucking page.

3173
04:03:11,539 --> 04:03:13,766
MATT: I take what I'm given, and I extrapolate.

3174
04:03:13,766 --> 04:03:14,694
SAM: Yeah, you do.

3175
04:03:14,694 --> 04:03:21,038
TALIESIN: You came up with most of that shit off
on your own. You didn't even write it down.

3176
04:03:21,038 --> 04:03:22,664
SAM: Yeah, for some of it I had.

3177
04:03:22,664 --> 04:03:26,275
MATT: Yeah, he had a lot of it, and then a few
things from this.

3178
04:03:26,275 --> 04:03:28,074
TALIESIN: Maryanne was off the cuff?

3179
04:03:28,074 --> 04:03:31,078
SAM: No, I think I had their names written down.

3180
04:03:31,078 --> 04:03:32,196
MATT: Yeah, you did.

3181
04:03:32,196 --> 04:03:43,878
MARISHA: Well, for anyone who has been asking: I
am okay. I did not leap off the cliff out of some

3182
04:03:43,878 --> 04:03:47,397
weird parallel allegory.

3183
04:03:47,397 --> 04:03:48,258
TRAVIS: What?

3184
04:03:48,258 --> 04:03:49,192
LAURA: What?

3185
04:03:49,192 --> 04:03:51,473
TALIESIN: I thought it was because your Logan's
Run crystal started flashing.

3186
04:03:51,473 --> 04:03:57,014
MARISHA: This was not a cry for help. Not a cry
for help. I thought it was going to be dope.

3187
04:03:57,014 --> 04:04:02,958
That's it. I just thought it was going to be cool
as shit, and then it wasn't.

3188
04:04:02,958 --> 04:04:07,667
MATT: No, and then it was absolutely was cool as
shit. What are you talking about? That's the kind

3189
04:04:07,667 --> 04:04:09,505
of shit that makes D&amp;D. Are you kidding me?

3190
04:04:09,505 --> 04:04:14,124
MARISHA: Yeah, you'd know if it's a cry for help.

3191
04:04:14,124 --> 04:04:19,187
TRAVIS: Yeah, great take-off, action was amazing.
The finish, though, the landing--

3192
04:04:19,187 --> 04:04:21,010
LAURA: Should have stuck the landing.

3193
04:04:21,010 --> 04:04:25,706
MATT: Everyone would have remembered a goldfish's
entry into the ocean for five minutes. Everyone is

3194
04:04:25,706 --> 04:04:29,393
going to remember Keyleth splattering across the
rocks forever.

3195
04:04:29,393 --> 04:04:33,405
TALIESIN: That goldfish wouldn't have remembered
it very long either.

3196
04:04:33,405 --> 04:04:38,372
LIAM: I've got this great trick, but I can only do
it once.

3197
04:04:38,372 --> 04:04:45,546
MARISHA: In my head, I was an awesome cartoon, and
it worked.

3198
04:04:45,546 --> 04:04:52,395
MATT: And it would have, but it got down to the
dice. As always, if I rolled lower than 50%, it

3199
04:04:52,395 --> 04:04:53,676
would have been fine.

3200
04:04:53,676 --> 04:04:55,097
MARISHA: 100d6 dice, yeah.

3201
04:04:55,097 --> 04:05:01,331
MATT: Percentage dice is what I meant, but anyway.
All right, guys. Have a good night, a good

3202
04:05:01,331 --> 04:05:08,011
weekend, rest well, and we'll see you guys next
week, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!
