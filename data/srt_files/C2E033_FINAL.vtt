NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
MATT: And hello, everyone. Welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.573
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons & Dragons.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.745
(cheering)

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:13.805
MATT: The three of us who were gone are happy to
be back. We missed you guys terribly. Back from

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:22.449
the dust and chaos. Anyway! As we adjust, let's
get through our announcements real fast. First and

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.291
foremost, we have two wonderful sponsors tonight,
beginning first with our friends at D&D Beyond!

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:37.134
SAM: D&D Beyond! Is this me? Okay. Guys-- I'm
actually nervous. Guys, the number nine has been

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:44.055
very important to us, and tonight, it's important
for another reason. D&D Beyond wants you to know

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:51.659
that at 9pm tonight, the Waterdeep Dragon Heist
adventure releases on D&D Beyond. That's 9:00pm

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.677
Pacific. That's in two hours, so it'll officially
be available for purchase through D&D Beyond

00:00:56.677 --> 00:01:02.055
Marketplace. Don't forget to pick it up in a
couple of hours, set your alarms. We'll probably

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:08.115
remind you when 9:00 comes around. But that's not
all. The number nine is special for other weird

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:16.614
reasons. This Sunday, September 9th, or 9/9, is
the first game of the regular season for Travis'

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:23.563
favorite team, the Dallas Cowboys. They're already
ranked top of their conference, as much as it

00:01:23.563 --> 00:01:31.824
pains me to say. Travis, two years ago, they won
nine straight games. Last year, they won how many

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.278
regular season games?

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:34.456
TRAVIS: (mumbling) Nine.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:38.633
SAM: Nine, yes! And this year, in training camp,
the standout defensive player was none other than

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:47.642
Antwaun Woods, number 99. To honor this amazing
concurrence of the number nine, I have done the

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:57.140
unthinkable. I am wearing a Dallas Cowboys
t-shirt. And guys, I have to say, it feels pretty

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:07.121
good. It feels pretty outstanding. Actually, it
feels a little odd.

00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:09.623
LAURA: Oh god, what's happening?

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:11.985
SAM: Oh god, it feels really weird!

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:13.090
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:24.384
SAM: Oh god, guys! I think my heart exploded! Oh
god, guys, I think I-- (gasping)

00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:29.233
LAURA: No. He died because of the shirt! We have
to get the shirt off of him! We have to get the

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.247
shirt off!

00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:32.195
TRAVIS: Were you an accomplice in this fucking
thing?

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.626
LAURA: We have to take it off of him, quick!

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:45.995
SAM: (gasping) Oh, guys! Guys, it was the shirt!
And now I feel better!

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:48.057
LAURA: If you get blood on my fucking clothes--

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:50.573
TRAVIS: You have to play like that all night.

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:54.408
MARISHA: And definitely blood on the Wyrmwood.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:55.085
LAURA: No!

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:58.552
TALIESIN: Oh wow that's everywhere.

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:02.672
MATT: (laughing hard)

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:05.141
TRAVIS: New level. Hope it was worth it.

00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.748
SAM: I'm covered in blood!

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.971
TRAVIS: It went down instead of up, didn't it?

00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:14.723
SAM: It did!

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:19.248
(laughter)

00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:21.064
SAM: It's everywhere.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:22.915
MARISHA: Do you have a change of pants?

00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:23.678
SAM: No.

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.618
MATT and TALIESIN: (laughing)

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:33.546
TRAVIS: That's what you get! You call down the
thunder and you pay for it!

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:38.607
MATT: Look, guys, the point is, he's alive.

00:03:38.607 --> 00:03:51.205
SAM: The point is, 9:00 tonight, guys. D&D Beyond.
Blood. I love you, Travis. Go Dallas.

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:57.244
TRAVIS: That's why you wouldn't hug me before the
show. No hugs before the show when you're up to shit.

00:03:57.244 --> 00:04:01.684
MARISHA: I saw Max holding that tubing. Should
have asked. Should have known.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.908
TRAVIS: You're going to be so sticky. What's it
taste like? Peppermint?

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:10.292
SAM: Mmm! That's not good!

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:19.896
MATT: I don't think that's mouth blood. There's
different types for on-camera stuff. Well, Sam,

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:24.481
I'm happy you're healthy and that you survived
this terrible assault.

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:25.899
SAM: Special effects, guys!

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.084
MATT: Well done.

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:29.072
TRAVIS: Laura, were you recruited to help with
that?

00:04:29.072 --> 00:04:35.286
SAM: She texted me saying, "Is Travis going to be
upset with me?" and I was like, "No, he's just

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:37.229
"going to be upset with me."

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.580
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. I'm actually very proud of you.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:49.701
LIAM: I guess the rest of us can't understand the
pressure of coming up with a D&D Beyond bit every week.

00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:53.688
TRAVIS: He finally snapped! He covered himself in
fake blood!

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:56.956
MARISHA: Yeah, jumped the shark on that one, man.

00:04:56.956 --> 00:05:00.091
SAM: Sorry. More announcements, guys!

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.287
MATT: Yeah, thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&D
Beyond.

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:07.106
MARISHA: Do you want to go take a flash shower?

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:12.441
MATT: Following up on that, we have another
announcement that went up. We're excited that

00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:16.335
we're now doing a live show for our appearance at
New York Comic Con.

00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:24.082
TRAVIS: That's right! New York City, we are coming
to you guys! East coast, this show is finally for

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:29.067
you. We are going to be at the United Palace
theater in Washington Heights, Thursday night at

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:35.022
9:00pm, October 4th, the Thursday before NYCC.
It's our first time on the east coast; take a

00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:39.737
train, take a plane, take an automobile! Whatever
it takes, come and see us. I do believe that the

00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:43.935
VIP tickets are sold out, but there are plenty
General Admission seats still available. It is a

00:05:43.935 --> 00:05:45.991
gorgeous theater. Liam, back me up.

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:48.519
LAURA: There's actually a few little orchestra
seats that are still available.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:50.279
LIAM: It's covered in gold.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.462
TRAVIS: It is! Gorgeous, proscenium arch theater
for those of you that are theater nerds like us.

00:05:54.462 --> 00:05:58.656
We would love to see you there. It's going to be
raucous and amazing. If you haven't made it to our

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:02.687
GenCon liveshow or one of the ones we did in LA
back in the day, don't miss it.

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:03.974
MATT: The one we did in LA.

00:06:03.974 --> 00:06:09.189
TRAVIS: Yeah, the <i>one</i> we did in LA. It's
frenetic and crazy, so please, please come and

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:15.275
join us. It'll be <i>amazing</i> and I'm sure Sam will
dress entirely normally.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:22.026
MATT: I'm sure. And we'll actually have Laura and
Travis for this one, too.

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:25.130
LIAM: No one's going to retain any of the things
you just said in the wake of that.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.145
SAM: But there will be links to buy tickets
somewhere. You can get them on Ticketmaster. Just

00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:32.142
go to Ticketmaster, look up Critical Role.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:36.294
MATT: critrole.com has all the information as
well. Marisha, I believe you had the latest

00:06:36.294 --> 00:06:38.344
episode of Handbooker Helper.

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:46.858
MARISHA: New episode! Whoa, you guys! New episode
of Handbooker Helper, and it's Liam, giving you

00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:54.389
the first quick-build on how to build a rogue.
Also, super quick, to address all the people who

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:00.733
are a little confused why we went from dice basics
to character sheets: we're wanting to show that

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:03.835
we're going to be doing a little bit of
everything. We're going to be rolling out tips

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:10.010
while we also build out character stuff. That way
we can get newbies playing as quickly as possible,

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.898
because in our experience, the first thing you do
is push over a character sheet to somebody.

00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:16.159
TRAVIS: Jump right in.

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.595
MARISHA: We jump right in.

00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:18.945
TRAVIS: Best way to learn to swim.

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:19.486
MARISHA: Yes!

00:07:19.486 --> 00:07:24.426
LIAM: We're also two weeks in, and in a year,
there will be a library of content that will last

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:27.125
forever, or until civilization falls.

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:32.139
MARISHA: So be patient! Rules are coming. It is
coming.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.739
LIAM: Roll them if you got them!

00:07:35.739 --> 00:07:40.040
MARISHA: We can only produce as fast as Max's
little hands can manage.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.915
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Go faster!

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.789
MATT: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:45.492
TALIESIN: That was a really good Doctor Claw.

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:51.267
MATT: Yeah. (deep voice) I'll get you, Gadget.
That's such a classic voice. Ah, I love it. Sam,

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:52.998
you have something you want to talk about?

00:07:52.998 --> 00:07:57.700
SAM: There's a quick update to the Pablove
Foundation charity push.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.725
LIAM: Do you have squibs of fake shit ready for
this?

00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:12.538
SAM: We hit our first two goals. We hit $20,000,
which means I'll be running a one-shot of Crash

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:22.371
Pandas. We hit $50,000, which means that the
Critters have contributed enough money to finance

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:29.378
an actual research grant that will go towards
curing childhood cancer, and so we've added a new

00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:36.452
goal. We're going to try and raise $100,000 for
the Pablove Foundation, and if we hit that goal,

00:08:36.452 --> 00:08:42.620
Sam-- that's me-- will do a special Fireside Chat,
complete with robe and fancy wine.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.831
ALL: Whoa!

00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:52.423
SAM: That $100,000 will be able to fully fund the
Shutterbugs Summer Photography Camp, which is a

00:08:52.423 --> 00:08:57.291
week-long summer camp for children suffering from
cancer, and they can all get to go to this

00:08:57.291 --> 00:09:03.453
photography camp and they learn how to do art and
it's incredible. More details are at critrole.com

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:12.177
and donate now at give.classy.org/teamherter. All
the links will be before you. More announcements!

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.925
LAURA: What was that word in there? Classy?

00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:14.919
SAM: Classy, yeah.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:19.705
MARISHA: It was so hard watching you deliver that
while looking like you just murdered someone in

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:24.739
cold blood. You were talking about wonderful
things while looking so incriminating.

00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:26.519
SAM: This comes out. This washes out, right?

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.230
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.302
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Critters, for
your fantastic support of this awesome charitable

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:39.373
cause. Also wanted to give a quick congratulations
to all of our Indian Critters of the LGBT

00:09:39.373 --> 00:09:47.858
community for a fantastic win today. Love you very
much, and a step in the right direction. Now, let

00:09:47.858 --> 00:09:49.986
me see. Do we have any merch announcements,
Laura?

00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:56.394
LAURA: Oh, just the same announcements from last
week. Which is all the stuff that's available at

00:09:56.724 --> 00:10:01.713
GenCon is now available in our store. So you can
go in there and check out some maps that are

00:10:01.713 --> 00:10:06.101
amazing. We have the Wildemount maps, now
available, by Deven Rue. They're really beautiful.

00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:13.143
We've got pins and we've got t-shirts and we've
got bumper stickers that are praising the

00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:14.653
Traveler's name.

00:10:14.653 --> 00:10:22.610
MATT: There you have it. Awesome. To finish up
here with our second sponsor tonight, bookending

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.442
it for you, our friends at Raven Rook, who are
just jumping into their Kickstarter. If you guys

00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:32.156
haven't seen, they have these really awesome,
high-quality, discbound journal/gaming notebooks

00:10:32.156 --> 00:10:37.132
that you can use, which are all different designs
and themes that look awesome. They have all the

00:10:37.132 --> 00:10:42.458
information you can fill in there for all your
character stuff, spells and levels. It's really,

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:46.764
really badass. Their quality is awesome, so you
can check out their stuff now at

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:54.402
therookandtheraven.com/criticalrole. Get there
before the Kickstarter campaign ends on September

00:10:54.402 --> 00:10:58.658
20, so you've only got a couple of more weeks on
that, but go check it out. They're amazing; the

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:09.494
quality of this is fantastic. Check it out. I
believe that's all of our announcements. After a

00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:15.895
two-week hiatus from our main story, let's jump
back in to tonight episode of Critical Role.

00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:20.849
[click, TV static]

00:11:20.849 --> 00:12:38.909
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:50.506
MATT: And welcome back. That was good. Oh boy.
Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had completed a

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:57.137
number of ventures within the Dwendalian Empire
since forming not but a few months before. Their

00:12:57.137 --> 00:13:02.785
friendship strengthened through victory and
through loss, they've decided, after a few weeks

00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:08.557
of downtime, to take on the next route of their
journey. Of all the different avenues that had

00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:12.698
come to their attention, it was decided to make
their way towards the Menagerie Coast to pursue

00:13:12.698 --> 00:13:18.997
some threads that seem to tie into some of the
directions that Fjord would like to travel, as

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:26.444
well as Jester returning to her home. You bought
some supplies, got your wagon prepared, and made a

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:32.003
trip south through previous locations that you
first made your way up north through, going to

00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:37.676
Alfield and drinking with Bryce, heading to
Trostenwald and paying off the rest of the debt

00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:46.636
for the previous runner, Gustav, of the carnival
which had sparked this whole union of friends.

00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:54.399
Continuing southward, past the Wuyun Gate, had a
brief encounter with two ettins, you managed to

00:13:54.399 --> 00:14:01.653
make your way to the Menagerie Coast itself,
seeing the gorgeous shores, the eastern jungles,

00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:06.545
the waves in the distance, and on the way,
actually purchased some pets as well, from a

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.601
traveling merchant caravan.

00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:12.231
LAURA: It was a totally smart idea.

00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:13.707
MARISHA: What have we done?

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.078
TRAVIS: Ridiculous. They're going to be dead in a
day.

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.203
LAURA: Best idea ever.

00:14:17.203 --> 00:14:17.935
SAM: Best.

00:14:17.935 --> 00:14:19.649
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:21.472
LAURA: What did he write?

00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:23.673
MARISHA: Why would you do this?

00:14:23.673 --> 00:14:32.107
LAURA: (gasps) And you did that with blood on your
hands! Terrible.

00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:34.756
TALIESIN: This will work out way better than that
Tamagotchi you owned.

00:14:34.756 --> 00:14:43.689
MATT: Mighty Nein, as you close the final miles to
the outskirts of the northern side of Nicodranas,

00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:49.099
the first and one of the major port towns in the
Menagerie Coast, what would you like to do?

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:52.983
LAURA: What do you guys want to see? What do you
want to do when we're here?

00:14:54.148 --> 00:14:57.024
MARISHA: We're here. What is there to do?

00:14:57.024 --> 00:14:58.898
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, what is there to see?

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.810
MARISHA: What's the main points of historical
interest?

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.987
LAURA: I don't know a lot, but there's the Lavish
Chateau.

00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:09.657
SAM: The Lavish Chateau?

00:15:09.657 --> 00:15:11.559
MARISHA: Is that where your mom works?

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:12.430
LAURA: Yeah!

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.719
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to see that.

00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.340
SAM: That's a tourist spot?

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:21.606
LAURA: Well, it's a really nice-- it's an inn, you
know? And my mom performs there. It's really nice.

00:15:21.606 --> 00:15:22.862
TALIESIN: Well, that sounds nice.

00:15:22.862 --> 00:15:27.419
TRAVIS: This area is known for its entertainment.
I mean, everybody's seen the ocean before, right?

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:27.915
MARISHA: No.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:29.212
TALIESIN: Well, actually.

00:15:29.212 --> 00:15:29.735
SAM: No.

00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:31.119
LIAM: No, I have never seen the ocean.

00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:33.556
TRAVIS: Wait, one, two, three? Never seen the
water?

00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:35.078
SAM: Not interested really, no.

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:37.673
TRAVIS: You should, it's amazing!

00:15:37.673 --> 00:15:38.879
MARISHA: I want to see that.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:41.209
TRAVIS: Have you not, either? Four?!

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:47.443
MARISHA: No. I've been landlocked my whole life,
man. You guys are the only two.

00:15:47.443 --> 00:15:51.399
TRAVIS: Wow. I feel like we're about to improve
all of your general experiences of the world.

00:15:51.912 --> 00:15:55.183
LAURA: It's really-- it's the opposite of fire,
Caleb.

00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:57.412
LIAM: What do you-- what?

00:15:57.412 --> 00:16:00.250
LAURA: It's really cool.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:08.241
TRAVIS: Maybe we drive towards the coast and then,
you know, take the PCH down to Nicodranas? What do

00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.463
you think?

00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:10.409
LAURA: Sure.

00:16:10.409 --> 00:16:12.443
TALIESIN: Big Sur is nice this time of year.

00:16:12.443 --> 00:16:15.511
TRAVIS: Yeah. Carmel-by-the-Sea's a peach.

00:16:15.511 --> 00:16:21.646
LAURA: I should probably keep myself disguised
while we're here, though, just in case.

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:25.836
MARISHA: Oh yeah, why exactly aren't you allowed
back home?

00:16:25.836 --> 00:16:28.032
SAM: She's told us.

00:16:28.032 --> 00:16:31.597
LAURA: Yeah. I pissed off that guy and he said he
would kill me.

00:16:31.597 --> 00:16:34.120
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, to kill you. That's
right.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.829
LIAM: Does that mean that he would hire people to
kill you, or he would personally kill you?

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:44.598
LAURA: No, he didn't seem like the type that would
really do a lot of killing himself, you know?

00:16:44.598 --> 00:16:47.612
LIAM: But is wealthy and connected?

00:16:47.612 --> 00:16:54.105
LAURA: Yes, and there's a lot of people you can
talk to here. If you want to get somebody killed,

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:56.230
here's the town to do it!

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.966
TRAVIS: Jester, Caduceus looks awful confused.
Maybe you could fill him in again about why your--

00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:04.893
LAURA: Fjord, you don't remember, do you?

00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.728
TRAVIS: No, I do. I'm looking out for our tall cow
friend.

00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:11.468
TALIESIN: I heard the whole story between games, I
don't really-- you should just know--

00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:16.635
TRAVIS: No, I know what's happening. I'm just
trying to, you know, schedule a tea break.

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:26.737
LAURA: Yeah, no. I pissed off this guy. He was
there to see my mom. The Traveler was teaching me

00:17:26.737 --> 00:17:33.289
different spells at the time, you know? I had just
started learning about them. So I sort of made

00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:36.219
myself look like my mother.

00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:38.387
SAM: And he tried to get with you?

00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:42.519
LAURA: Well, I sort of lured him out onto the
balcony.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:45.335
SAM: Oh, that's right, and embarrassed him. In the
nude.

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.040
LAURA: Yeah, he was just stuck out there. That's
all.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.030
LIAM: You locked him out.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.696
LAURA: Yeah.

00:17:48.696 --> 00:17:50.704
MARISHA: I mean, without pants, right?

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:51.298
LAURA: Yeah!

00:17:51.298 --> 00:17:52.727
MARISHA: That's really funny. Yeah.

00:17:52.727 --> 00:17:54.008
TRAVIS: Would you remember his name?

00:17:54.008 --> 00:17:54.616
LAURA: Yeah.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:55.888
SAM: What is it?

00:17:55.888 --> 00:17:58.070
LAURA: Lord Sharp.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.648
SAM: Lord Sharp.

00:17:59.648 --> 00:18:05.444
MARISHA: Wow. Is that a chosen name? Is he an
edgelord Sharp?

00:18:05.444 --> 00:18:08.302
LAURA: No. He was super not sharp.

00:18:08.302 --> 00:18:10.572
MARISHA: Oh, he's a dumb dumb?

00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:13.881
LAURA: Oh, you were talking about the mind.

00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:15.403
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

00:18:15.403 --> 00:18:21.916
TRAVIS: Did he just visit all the time, or is he
well known in Nicodranas for business, or shady dealings?

00:18:21.916 --> 00:18:24.678
LAURA: I don't know. I didn't even know he was a
lord.

00:18:24.678 --> 00:18:26.512
TRAVIS: Oh, you just found out afterwards.

00:18:26.512 --> 00:18:32.525
MARISHA: So this was a random hit. He was a random
hit job for your Traveler shenanigans.

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:40.292
LAURA: Everybody was a hit job with-- everybody.
Nobody made it out clean from that place.

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:47.985
LIAM: What about besides your mother's place of
employment? Do you know, are there other things to see?

00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:53.211
LAURA: Well, all over the Opal Archways is this
really pretty-- it's a great marketplace and

00:18:53.211 --> 00:19:04.685
stuff. Lots of shops. I didn't see too much, from
my window you could see all the houses. It looked

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:09.097
like a quilt. It was beautiful with the roofs. And
you could see the ocean, so I know the wharfs are

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:10.271
around there, you know?

00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:12.074
TRAVIS: Yep, indeed.

00:19:12.074 --> 00:19:12.581
LIAM: Okay.

00:19:12.581 --> 00:19:15.802
SAM: Well, should we go to some of your favorite
places first?

00:19:15.802 --> 00:19:18.027
MARISHA: Can we see the ocean?

00:19:18.027 --> 00:19:19.303
LAURA: You want to see my room?

00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:20.710
LIAM: You want to go straight there?

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.465
LAURA: Well, we can go to the ocean first.

00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:29.242
TRAVIS: The road down is treacherous. The benefit
of being on the coast is that you limit your field

00:19:29.242 --> 00:19:33.307
of danger, right, it's only going to come from one
direction. That's just something to keep in mind.

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:34.732
TALIESIN: That's a very fair point.

00:19:34.732 --> 00:19:37.153
LAURA: Fjord, but what about all the sea
monsters?

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:41.067
MARISHA: Yeah, you definitely have sea creatures
that haunt your dreams.

00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:43.884
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. Not true, actually. I have never
seen--

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:45.174
LAURA: Giant sea monsters.

00:19:45.174 --> 00:19:45.714
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:19:45.714 --> 00:19:48.937
MARISHA: You coughed up salt water, and you
weren't even near the ocean. That feels like the

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:50.508
ocean's real dangerous to me.

00:19:50.508 --> 00:19:54.503
TRAVIS: That could be a pituitary thing. I have
never seen a sea creature in my life.

00:19:54.503 --> 00:19:58.752
LAURA: There's so many. I saw a giant tentacle
come out of the water one time.

00:19:58.752 --> 00:20:00.046
LIAM: Right on the coast, you saw that?

00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:00.647
LAURA: Yeah.

00:20:00.647 --> 00:20:02.031
MARISHA: A tentacle came out of the water?

00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:05.766
LAURA: I saw it from my window. It was a really,
really, really big tentacle.

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:06.930
TRAVIS: Did you really?

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.549
LAURA: Of course I did.

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:10.147
TRAVIS: Do I believe her?

00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:11.832
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:20:11.832 --> 00:20:17.817
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's not terrible. Oh, it is
terrible. 14.

00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:20.570
LAURA: I really, really, really saw a tentacle.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.023
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Okay.

00:20:22.023 --> 00:20:23.600
LAURA: A really big one.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.565
MARISHA: How close do we have to be to the ocean
while we walk alongside it?

00:20:27.565 --> 00:20:32.700
TRAVIS: Oh, I mean, as close as you want to be. If
you want to put your feet in, it's an amazing experience.

00:20:33.214 --> 00:20:35.476
TALIESIN: I definitely want to do that. That
sounds great.

00:20:35.476 --> 00:20:37.504
TRAVIS: It's colder than you might think.

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:41.551
TALIESIN: I don't have any expectations, so, I'm
not sure if that's true or not.

00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:46.189
TRAVIS: From where we are now, would I have any
idea how far from the gates that we just-- have we

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:47.543
passed through the gates?

00:20:47.543 --> 00:20:50.958
MATT: You haven't made it to the gates of the city
yet. You're probably about 20 or so minutes from

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:57.353
reaching the exterior of Nicodranas. If you were
to head straight south, as opposed to continuing

00:20:57.353 --> 00:21:02.374
on the somewhat southwestern path towards the
city, you would eventually hit the shoreline on

00:21:02.374 --> 00:21:08.272
the eastern side of the city for about 40, 45
minutes or so to get there.

00:21:08.272 --> 00:21:11.283
TRAVIS: Well we're so close, we might as well stop
in--

00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:12.749
LAURA: Stop by the ocean?

00:21:12.749 --> 00:21:15.035
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, or your mom's place. Whatever
you want to do first.

00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:18.547
MARISHA: So is there a location to go to the
ocean?

00:21:18.547 --> 00:21:24.282
TRAVIS: Yeah, I forget you haven't seen it. So if
you look in one direction, and you look

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:31.535
immediately to your left and then immediately to
your right, all that shit is ocean.

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:35.191
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:38.861
TRAVIS: All of it. And as far as-- you see that
line?

00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:39.838
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:21:39.838 --> 00:21:41.857
TRAVIS: The horizon? That's all ocean, too.

00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:42.695
MARISHA: That's crazy.

00:21:42.695 --> 00:21:43.228
TRAVIS: It is.

00:21:43.228 --> 00:21:45.548
LAURA: It's really big. It's like a lake, only a
lot bigger.

00:21:45.548 --> 00:21:49.005
MARISHA: I've seen big lakes, but you can always
see the other side.

00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:50.251
LAURA: Yeah, imagine not.

00:21:50.251 --> 00:21:52.428
LIAM: Well, sometimes-- okay. Point stands.

00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:58.127
LAURA: And the water is not that greenish dark
color. It's really beautiful and light blue.

00:21:58.127 --> 00:22:05.703
MARISHA: See, I like these literal examples.
Because I've only read flowery poetry that makes

00:22:05.703 --> 00:22:06.600
it talk about--

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.760
LAURA: Once we get up over this next hill, you'll
see the ocean.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.494
SAM: Let's go!

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.074
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go.

00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:15.372
MATT: So heading southward, deviating from the
path that leads directly into Nicodranas, The

00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:20.677
Mighty Nein makes their way southward towards the
shoreline. The better part of an hour passes. You

00:22:20.677 --> 00:22:27.116
can see to the right, the exterior walls of the
city and beyond the somewhat light gray to white

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:31.567
patterned walls. They may have been gray at one
point, but the white pattern you can see across

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:37.330
them seems to be layers and layers and years and
years of seagull excrement having gathered,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.623
stronger towards the southern side of the wall as
you pass near that section of the city.

00:22:41.623 --> 00:22:43.192
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self.

00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:45.157
MATT: Okay. What do you look like?

00:22:45.157 --> 00:22:47.990
LAURA: Basically me, only human.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.548
MATT: Okay. Human Jester.

00:22:50.548 --> 00:22:51.992
LAURA: All the same, only yeah.

00:22:51.992 --> 00:22:52.930
TRAVIS: Blue skin gone?

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.389
LAURA: Blue skin's gone, horns are gone, no tail.

00:22:55.389 --> 00:22:56.530
MARISHA: That cute little bob.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.521
LAURA: Cute little bob, but it's black hair
instead.

00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:02.697
MARISHA: So cute. You look like Catherine
Zeta-Jones in Chicago.

00:23:02.697 --> 00:23:04.135
TRAVIS: Super tan skin?

00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:04.939
LAURA: Yeah.

00:23:04.939 --> 00:23:06.077
MARISHA: I love it.

00:23:06.077 --> 00:23:12.984
MATT: Okay, great. Continuing on this way, you
begin to see the seagulls now, new birds for a lot

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:19.543
of you here. You can see these white (cawing)
going overhead as they begin to cluster and hit

00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:23.381
the shoreline. You see a few of them diving
towards the water as you begin to look past the

00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:30.565
edge of the rock into the sand bank. You can see
eventually as your cart begins to make its way

00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:38.125
towards the rougher bit of terrain before it
breaks at the ocean, the actual waves now crashing

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:43.796
up against the shore and now pulling away. Pushing
again.

00:23:43.796 --> 00:23:45.687
SAM: It's horrifying.

00:23:45.687 --> 00:23:46.579
LAURA: What?

00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:47.951
SAM: It's everywhere.

00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:49.286
MARISHA: It is everywhere.

00:23:49.286 --> 00:23:51.680
SAM: It's coming to get us. It's literally coming
to get us.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.274
LAURA: No, it stays right there. It goes in and--

00:23:53.274 --> 00:23:57.276
SAM: It comes towards us every 15 seconds or so.

00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:59.661
MARISHA: It's so blue.

00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:04.006
TRAVIS: Those are seagulls. They are some
dickheads. If you leave food out, they'll snake

00:24:04.006 --> 00:24:05.830
that shit in a second.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.055
MARISHA: They make horrible noises.

00:24:07.055 --> 00:24:07.743
SAM: Will they?

00:24:07.743 --> 00:24:11.665
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. And they drop shit on you from
above, so keep your eye out.

00:24:11.665 --> 00:24:13.680
LAURA: Most birds do that, Fjord.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.518
TRAVIS: These ones in particular are pricks.

00:24:15.518 --> 00:24:17.500
MARISHA: I join Caduceus in the water.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.400
MATT: Okay. Yeah, looking past the afternoon sun
at this vantage point especially, you can see it

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:28.263
dancing across the distant horizon shore like
hundreds of little glistening flecks of glass. The

00:24:28.263 --> 00:24:32.495
shore's sound itself is very soothing as you
approach and pull up your pants and take off your

00:24:32.495 --> 00:24:37.572
boots to begin to step into the soft sand. You can
see large rocks that occasionally break up the

00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:43.105
beach itself that jut outward, and on these you
can see small carvings. You can see things that

00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:46.327
have been drawn on them with chalk, it looks like,
that have been mostly washed away or eroded with

00:24:46.327 --> 00:24:53.856
time. As close as maybe 150 feet out, you see a
small fishing ship that is on the outskirts of the

00:24:53.856 --> 00:24:59.131
southern portion of the city. Glancing off to the
right to where the city docks begin, you can see

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:03.801
dozens of ships that are in the middle of the
harbor, that are coming into the harbor, many that

00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:09.652
are in the process of being anchored and then set
up within the docks themselves. This eastern side

00:25:09.652 --> 00:25:16.530
you recognize as the Restless Wharf of the city
and you know the harbor is broken into two

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.520
different sides.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.415
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment to look
through the sand and rocks and see if there's

00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:22.509
anything interesting.

00:25:22.509 --> 00:25:24.525
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:25:24.525 --> 00:25:32.913
TALIESIN: 15. Investigation? Wait, hold on.
Investigation. Never mind, that's a six.

00:25:32.913 --> 00:25:42.278
MATT: You find a lot of really soft sand. You
start putting it into piles, and then you start

00:25:42.278 --> 00:25:46.847
building a cool little mound and a wave comes and
destroys it and you're a little sad. But that's

00:25:46.847 --> 00:25:48.064
how life works.

00:25:48.064 --> 00:25:51.314
TRAVIS: Oh, the lessons.

00:25:51.314 --> 00:25:53.389
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:58.922
MARISHA: Can I go out to the rocks and see how far
I can hop along the rocks?

00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:01.098
MATT: Okay, yeah. There's the--

00:26:01.098 --> 00:26:04.106
LAURA: Do you know how to swim, Beau?

00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:04.858
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:04.858 --> 00:26:11.604
MATT: The rocks are pretty disparate amongst the
shore here. There is one section where you can see

00:26:11.604 --> 00:26:17.536
a string of four rocks at different heights that
eventually get to about 30 or so feet out into the

00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:22.150
shore before they disappear beneath the ocean
surface. So before you even touch the water you

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.225
dive on up to one of the rocks, and as you get to
the top your hands hit there and you can already

00:26:26.225 --> 00:26:32.804
see the top of the rock is bleached white with
seagull shit. But it's dry. Glancing over the

00:26:32.804 --> 00:26:36.674
side, you make a leap to the next one. Make an
athletics check.

00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:38.790
LIAM: Is there easy access to the water here?

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.594
MATT: Yeah. You can just walk right into it. It's
an open beach right here.

00:26:41.594 --> 00:26:42.814
MARISHA: 25.

00:26:42.814 --> 00:26:49.050
MATT: 25. You deftly leap from rock to rock until
eventually you get to the final one. It's maybe

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.473
breaking about three or four feet out of the water
and you're perched on it and looking out in the

00:26:53.473 --> 00:27:02.856
distance. You can see the rolling waves coming in,
you can see-- just like that, yeah. It's a

00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:08.771
beautiful sight. The sun maybe has a few more
hours before it begins to become full dusk and the

00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:13.394
colors begin to shift in the sky. But for you
having never seen the ocean, for many of you, it's

00:27:13.394 --> 00:27:18.648
serene, it's different, it's beautiful, it's warm.
And Caduceus, as you put your feet into the water

00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:26.064
it is quite cool. It isn't freezing, it's a
comfortable temperate temperature. You feel the

00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:32.998
sand grip and slowly dissipate between your toes
as you pull it in. It's a really unique sensation

00:27:32.998 --> 00:27:35.360
and you can't help but be excited by it.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.662
TALIESIN: You're right, this is spectacular.

00:27:39.662 --> 00:27:43.516
TRAVIS: Right? Pretty nice. Soak it up, man.

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:51.009
MARISHA: Beau is going to perch on the rock, and
for the first time ever, willingly meditate, while

00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:54.515
just focusing on the blue that she is now
surrounded by.

00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:55.431
MATT: Okay.

00:27:55.431 --> 00:28:03.039
LIAM: Caleb has just been staring for a while, and
is standing next to Nott. He takes off every

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:08.290
stitch of clothing and everything except for one
thing, and hands it to Nott and walks in.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.282
MATT: You watch as Caleb--

00:28:11.282 --> 00:28:12.580
LAURA: Caleb's naked!

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.091
LIAM: Yes.

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:16.396
MATT: Caleb slowly submerges entirely into the
ocean.

00:28:16.396 --> 00:28:18.183
LIAM: I'm just going to walk out into it.

00:28:18.183 --> 00:28:21.254
MATT: Up to the neck, or fully submerged?

00:28:21.254 --> 00:28:25.117
LIAM: He would keep going and eventually start
floating on my back.

00:28:25.117 --> 00:28:31.406
MATT: Eventually you see Caleb vanish beneath the
ocean. There's a brief moment of worry as a few

00:28:31.406 --> 00:28:37.027
seconds pass with no sight before you see (bloop),
buoyantly finding his way to the surface.

00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:38.643
TRAVIS: See, Nott? Easy as pie.

00:28:38.643 --> 00:28:40.257
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:28:40.257 --> 00:28:47.358
LAURA: We can still see your weenie! I can see
it!

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:49.184
TRAVIS: I think his ears are underwater.

00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:56.455
SAM: I'm going to nicely fold his clothes and put
it on a nearby log or something. Then I'll pull up

00:28:56.455 --> 00:29:04.605
my Cloak of Elvenkind and put out a couple of
pieces of meat, because Fjord told me that

00:29:04.605 --> 00:29:12.852
seagulls come for food. I'll hide and have my
crossbow loaded and ready to go.

00:29:12.852 --> 00:29:15.902
TRAVIS: I'm not stopping her.

00:29:15.902 --> 00:29:21.303
MATT: As you crouch down, you notice the clothing
you place as Caleb begins to shift. Moving slowly

00:29:21.303 --> 00:29:22.433
to one side.

00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:30.159
SAM: Are you trying to prank, Caleb? I will not
stand for that. Well, I'll go fetch it. Pick it up.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.003
MATT: You pull it up, and you see beneath it a
large sand crab that emerges from underneath it,

00:29:34.003 --> 00:29:38.443
looks up at you with two small black beads for
eyes, and the claws (snapping).

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.526
SAM: I'm going to try to grab it.

00:29:39.526 --> 00:29:41.061
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

00:29:41.061 --> 00:29:41.679
LAURA: Oh god!

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.055
MARISHA: Yes, yes!

00:29:43.055 --> 00:29:46.505
SAM: Ooh, not good. Dexterity check? 11.

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:51.414
MATT: 11. It rolled exactly an 11 on its
dexterity, so you manage to just capture it. It's

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:56.548
going to attempt to snipe at you. That's a 17 to
hit with the armor class.

00:29:56.548 --> 00:29:58.146
SAM: It hits!

00:29:58.146 --> 00:30:01.542
MATT: Your thumb clamps down and there's an
immediate flash of pain through your body.

00:30:01.542 --> 00:30:04.853
LAURA: He's bleeding so much! There's so much
blood!

00:30:04.853 --> 00:30:08.687
MATT: As you're trying to shake it off, it's still
whipping back and forth, holding on tightly.

00:30:08.687 --> 00:30:17.557
SAM: I'm going to go down on it with my knee. Jump
up and knee down on it.

00:30:17.557 --> 00:30:20.480
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.532
SAM: Ooh, not good! Ten.

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:36.262
MATT: Ten? Thankfully, it rolled lower than you.
It takes you a little bit of effort. It takes you

00:30:36.262 --> 00:30:40.153
two or three leaps, because it keeps skittering
out of the way, and you're not about to be bested

00:30:40.153 --> 00:30:44.638
by a small crustacean. For the third try, you
manage to get just enough leverage as you push

00:30:44.638 --> 00:30:51.276
into the air, and with one resounding crack down
through its external shell, it releases its grip

00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:55.970
somewhat on your thumb. You have to actually pry
it off. It seems to be locked into its death grip.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:05.536
SAM: You fought bravely. Hmm, more bait! I'll
break a bunch of the crab and put it out. And go

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.956
back to my perch.

00:31:06.956 --> 00:31:11.805
MATT: Okay, and over the next ten minutes or so,
you watch as one seagull comes down, eats and

00:31:11.805 --> 00:31:19.234
grabs it, (whooshing) about 25 of them suddenly
descend as word gets out and you're surrounded by

00:31:19.234 --> 00:31:25.589
white birds. We'll say, for the sake of narrative,
you manage to pick off about eight of them before

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:31.284
they end up scattering away from it. You have this
beach riddled with dead seagulls, with crossbow

00:31:31.284 --> 00:31:33.044
bolts out of their bodies.

00:31:33.044 --> 00:31:35.213
SAM: I'll retrieve the crossbow bolts and that's
it.

00:31:35.213 --> 00:31:36.574
LAURA: You just leave them dead?

00:31:36.574 --> 00:31:38.631
SAM: No, I'm going to take the bodies, too.

00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:42.650
LIAM: I have a question. Right now, where is the
Lavorregard menagerie?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.505
LAURA: What?

00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:45.074
LIAM: Where is the owl, the weasel--

00:31:45.074 --> 00:31:46.437
MATT: In the cart, I believe.

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:49.035
LAURA: Oh, no, I have Nugget with me, weasel's
little Sprinkle.

00:31:49.035 --> 00:31:50.484
LIAM: Owl, too? Owl's with you?

00:31:50.484 --> 00:31:51.735
MARISHA: Yeah, owl's by the cart.

00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.503
LIAM: I need constant updates to where these
animals are.

00:31:53.503 --> 00:31:54.676
LAURA: Sprinkle is here.

00:31:54.676 --> 00:31:56.011
LIAM: That's the weasel?

00:31:56.011 --> 00:31:57.471
LAURA: Yes. Like on a doughnut.

00:31:57.471 --> 00:31:59.135
MARISHA: We did some training on the road.

00:31:59.135 --> 00:32:02.579
LAURA: Yeah. I want to play fetch with Nugget,
here at the beach.

00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:05.650
MATT: if you guys are doing some training, what
are you training him in?

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.982
LAURA: I want to train Nugget to blink back to
us.

00:32:09.982 --> 00:32:11.716
SAM: On a command?

00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:15.524
MATT: It's going to take you a couple hours of
working with him here on the beach, but you can do

00:32:15.524 --> 00:32:17.484
that. Make an animal handling check.

00:32:17.484 --> 00:32:20.933
LAURA: Oh god. I'm so scared.

00:32:20.933 --> 00:32:23.330
TRAVIS: Say goodbye to that King Charles spaniel.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.978
LAURA: 17.

00:32:23.978 --> 00:32:31.473
MATT: Okay, utilizing bits of the feed and the
snacks that you had purchased off of the original

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:37.322
vendor, with Sprinkle tucked up in your neck, and
they're focused on their various endeavors,

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:46.305
Jester's tunnel vision focused on this adorable
little blink dog. The fur is a light tan color

00:32:46.305 --> 00:32:54.515
with bits of faintly darker brown stripes and a
hint of calico elements to its coat, but very

00:32:54.515 --> 00:33:03.439
faint along the back. Oversized puppy paws that
look soft and goofy, but the limbs themselves are a

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:09.503
little unnaturally angular for a natural dog. You
can see some of its fey nature peeking through in

00:33:09.503 --> 00:33:16.367
its features. Its ears are very tall and pointed,
though wide at the base. As you start teaching it

00:33:16.367 --> 00:33:21.222
to blink, you watch as it prepares each time, and
as it begins to figure out the commands and what

00:33:21.222 --> 00:33:25.891
you're trying to guide, the eyes begin to go from
a dark black to a bright blue right before it

00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:30.799
blinks over here and the eyes fade from blue to
black as soon as it manages to find its next

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:36.140
location. Over the next two hours or so of you
working with this, you begin to eventually develop

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:44.877
the early stages of finding ways to command it to
teleport when you want it to, although you can't

00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:49.996
really guide where it's going to teleport yet. But
you've learned a command or a whistle of your

00:33:49.996 --> 00:33:53.270
choice that will tell it to blink.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.305
TRAVIS: So happy.

00:33:57.305 --> 00:33:58.811
LAURA: Yeah, this is so wonderful.

00:33:58.811 --> 00:34:01.241
TRAVIS: Can't wait for this to go wrong.

00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:03.685
MATT: So you get to decide on that.

00:34:03.685 --> 00:34:08.368
LIAM: If she has ten gold pieces worth of incense
she can bring it back to-- nope.

00:34:08.368 --> 00:34:10.562
MATT: Did you name your owl?

00:34:10.562 --> 00:34:11.600
MARISHA: I did.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.196
MATT: What did you name your owl?

00:34:13.196 --> 00:34:15.286
MARISHA: This is Professor Thaddeus.

00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:20.028
TRAVIS: Well yeah, sure.

00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:21.734
LAURA: He looks like a professor.

00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:22.275
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:24.022
TALIESIN: He looks like a Thaddeus.

00:34:24.022 --> 00:34:27.592
MARISHA: I couldn't decide if he looked more like
a professor or more like a Thaddeus and then I realized--

00:34:27.617 --> 00:34:28.877
TALIESIN: Why not a both?

00:34:28.877 --> 00:34:29.570
MARISHA: Exactly.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.226
MATT: Do you meditate for the full two hours that
she's training the blink dog, or do you return to

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.494
Professor Thaddeus in the cart?

00:34:35.494 --> 00:34:44.343
MARISHA: No, Beau could not meditate for two
hours. No. I meditate for ten minutes, tops. Then I

00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:52.351
go back and-- I want to train Professor Thaddeus
to come when I look regal and hold out my arm.

00:34:52.351 --> 00:34:58.311
MATT: Okay, so you stand about 50 yards from the
cart and hold aloft your forearm, and attempt to

00:34:58.311 --> 00:35:00.174
find a way to coax Professor Thaddeus.

00:35:00.174 --> 00:35:01.613
MARISHA: Professor!

00:35:01.613 --> 00:35:04.034
MATT: Roll an animal handling check.

00:35:04.034 --> 00:35:05.755
MARISHA: Professor, come!

00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:07.383
SAM: Offer it tenure.

00:35:07.383 --> 00:35:16.039
MARISHA: Exactly. Oh, that's pretty good! 21? I
rolled a natural 18, 21.

00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:26.310
MATT: Okay, 21. Over the next hour and a half or
so, you realize that your owl won't just come to you.

00:35:27.108 --> 00:35:32.958
You begin to find coaxing it with pieces of meat that
you scavenge from the remnants of the meal.

00:35:32.958 --> 00:35:35.338
MARISHA: Can I have a gull?

00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:36.590
SAM: Have a whole seagull!

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.112
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:35:37.112 --> 00:35:43.444
MATT: You're waving the seagull, it seems a bit
large, but eventually, in smaller pieces, you begin

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:48.236
to realize you can coax it and you can get it to come
to you when you have a piece of food in your grasp.

00:35:48.236 --> 00:35:49.482
MARISHA: He's so moody.

00:35:49.482 --> 00:35:52.167
LIAM: Mr. Owl, how many handling checks does it
take--

00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:53.724
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:35:53.724 --> 00:35:57.092
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: A one, a two, a three.

00:35:57.092 --> 00:35:58.884
MARISHA: Owls are dicks.

00:35:58.884 --> 00:36:04.477
MATT: Yeah. You've begun the process of forming a
bond with your animal.

00:36:04.477 --> 00:36:09.175
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a minute to try and
explain to the Professor what a doctorate is.

00:36:09.175 --> 00:36:10.354
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:10.354 --> 00:36:12.956
TALIESIN: If he's confused.

00:36:12.956 --> 00:36:17.277
MARISHA: No, I just nod and hope that Thaddeus is
listening.

00:36:17.277 --> 00:36:23.313
MATT: Thaddeus seems to already have a stronger
bond with Caduceus than you.

00:36:23.313 --> 00:36:26.482
MARISHA: Stop talking to my owl.

00:36:26.482 --> 00:36:28.016
TALIESIN: All right.

00:36:28.016 --> 00:36:37.771
MATT: While this chaos is happening with Caduceus
slowly wading through the shoreline, Caleb floating

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:43.099
in the distance, practically nude, Nott
diminishing the population of the various

00:36:43.099 --> 00:36:47.406
waterfowl, and those two training
their pets, what are you doing, Fjord?

00:36:47.406 --> 00:36:53.455
TRAVIS: Nott, are you sure you don't want to come
in? I'm sure Jester would hold your hand or something.

00:36:53.455 --> 00:36:58.815
SAM: That sounds lovely, but I think I'll just
watch from the shore.

00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:06.393
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll walk up to the shore and put my
boots in, ankles deep, in the water and stand

00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:11.870
there. Then I'll summon the falchion next
to my side.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:20.605
MATT: As the falchion emerges from whatever pocket
space it resides when not in use, there's a splash

00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:27.647
of ocean water across the ground, flung from the
very faint bit of force that is released upon its

00:37:27.647 --> 00:37:34.101
summoning. As you hold it in your grasp and hold
it before you, looking at it for a moment, the

00:37:34.101 --> 00:37:40.284
sunlight gleaming off the blade showing the
intricacies of its curvature, of the falchion

00:37:40.284 --> 00:37:49.580
Summer's Dance mutation that has come from the
consuming of the blade not long ago. It feels

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:55.761
cold, same temperature of the ocean that you're
currently sitting in, and as the temperature of

00:37:55.761 --> 00:37:59.382
the ocean warms to your touch so does the
temperature of the blade you're holding.

00:38:01.962 --> 00:38:10.673
TRAVIS: Hmm. How far out is Caleb in the water?

00:38:10.673 --> 00:38:13.639
MATT: I'd say he's about 15 feet out. Not too
far.

00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:22.838
TRAVIS: Can I use Misty Step to appear right next
to him in the water and scare the shit out of him?

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:31.729
MATT: Yes, you may. Caleb, as you've been lying
there, looking up into the beautiful blue sky with

00:38:31.729 --> 00:38:43.041
faint tufts of white drifting by, but mostly this
unending sphere of blue color before you, Fjord

00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:46.784
just appears, a shadow above you, looming in the
water.

00:38:46.784 --> 00:38:50.552
LIAM: <i>Scheisse!</i> (coughing)

00:38:50.552 --> 00:38:54.881
TRAVIS: Whoa, hey! All right there, chief. Okay,
all right, you're good. Sorry.

00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:57.796
LIAM: You can't just sneak up on a person.

00:38:57.796 --> 00:39:00.972
TRAVIS: Sorry, I just figured you want some
company. It's really tranquil, isn't it?

00:39:00.972 --> 00:39:05.447
LIAM: (groaning) Oh, it's very quite nice.

00:39:05.447 --> 00:39:08.668
TRAVIS: Yeah. You seem very at home in the water,
I'm surprised.

00:39:08.668 --> 00:39:10.081
LIAM: I tuck down four feet.

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.058
TRAVIS: Caleb?

00:39:11.058 --> 00:39:14.441
LIAM: Well, no, I am just submerging my bits.

00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:22.891
TRAVIS: I mean, I must commend you. A lot of
people are very trepidatious in the face of a

00:39:22.891 --> 00:39:24.398
force of nature like this.

00:39:24.398 --> 00:39:28.941
LIAM: No, it's expansive, it just keeps going
forever.

00:39:28.941 --> 00:39:31.337
TRAVIS: It suits you very well.

00:39:31.337 --> 00:39:33.222
LIAM: Why did you leave it?

00:39:33.222 --> 00:39:39.730
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't leave it intentionally. I
tried to make my way back up north to see if I

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:44.984
could learn more about the sword and everything.
But I've always loved the water, yeah.

00:39:44.984 --> 00:39:47.374
LIAM: So it feels good to be back, <i>ja?</i>

00:39:47.374 --> 00:39:54.337
TRAVIS: It does, yeah. I would live right on the
water if I could. Yeah.

00:39:54.337 --> 00:39:59.162
LIAM: So maybe you stay this time?

00:39:59.162 --> 00:40:05.001
TRAVIS: Yeah. I take care of what I need to take
care of, I think a calm life on the water would

00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:06.986
suit me just fine.

00:40:06.986 --> 00:40:11.914
MATT: As a unique visual perspective here, too, as
Caleb is no longer just floating buoyant, but who

00:40:11.914 --> 00:40:17.964
has probably not had too much experience swimming
in the past, is having to haphazardly thrash--

00:40:17.964 --> 00:40:19.812
LIAM: 15 feet out?

00:40:19.812 --> 00:40:23.622
TRAVIS: Those sandbars are unpredictable, man.
They drop right the fuck off.

00:40:23.622 --> 00:40:25.056
MARISHA: 15 feet out is far.

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:29.371
MATT: It's closer to 20, we'll say. Enough to the
point where you can submerge and touch your feet

00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:38.433
underneath, but to stay above the water you're
talking as you thrash. Fjord is gently buoyant, occasionally

00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:44.277
putting the hands in the water, the armor itself
keeping you mostly aloft by its enchantment, and

00:40:44.277 --> 00:40:50.478
just being comfortable in the water it's Fjord
looming over as you're keeping up with him best

00:40:50.478 --> 00:40:51.960
you can.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.255
LAURA: It's like us when we went scuba diving.

00:40:54.255 --> 00:41:03.566
LIAM: I take a moment and scan the beach and call
out: Nott the Brave, live up to your name and jump

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:05.191
in the ocean!

00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:08.606
LAURA: There is no comma, there is no comma!

00:41:08.606 --> 00:41:13.472
MARISHA: Is that-- it-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:15.791
SAM: It's so big.

00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:21.387
LAURA: There is a comma. There is a comma! I know
what I'm talking about, get in there.

00:41:21.387 --> 00:41:23.627
LIAM: Who cares? Go swimming!

00:41:23.627 --> 00:41:29.075
SAM: Give me a minute. I just ate some seagull I
need to wait a half hour.

00:41:29.075 --> 00:41:33.129
TRAVIS: That's an old wives' tale, it's not true!

00:41:33.129 --> 00:41:39.312
SAM: I think it's true, I'm cramping. I'm cramping
already. It could be the crab that bit me.

00:41:39.312 --> 00:41:42.736
TRAVIS: What is it with Nott and the water, do you
have any idea?

00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:50.945
LIAM: I don't know. She doesn't like to swim, I
don't think. But you'd imagine seeing something

00:41:50.945 --> 00:41:53.808
like this would give perspective.

00:41:53.808 --> 00:41:57.180
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm going in. Forget this.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:04.131
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion, you
watch as this beacon of pink hair emerges from the

00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:05.792
water next to you.

00:42:05.792 --> 00:42:08.333
TALIESIN: This smells weird. I really like it.

00:42:08.333 --> 00:42:11.779
LIAM: Is this one of those sea monsters they were
talking about?

00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:15.336
TRAVIS: It might be, yeah. I think that might have
been the tentacle that Jester saw from--

00:42:15.336 --> 00:42:17.309
LIAM: You have not seen the ocean--

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:18.541
TALIESIN: Never before.

00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:19.951
LIAM: It's pretty nice, isn't it?

00:42:19.951 --> 00:42:21.425
TALIESIN: It's amazing.

00:42:21.425 --> 00:42:24.390
TRAVIS: You're actually in for-- this is a treat.
The sunsets are gorgeous here.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.355
TALIESIN: Oh, man. I can't even imagine.

00:42:26.355 --> 00:42:28.601
LIAM: Should we stay here for the night?

00:42:28.601 --> 00:42:29.421
LAURA: No!

00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:32.322
MARISHA: Can we camp on the beach?

00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:35.545
LAURA: Don't you want to see my mom, though?

00:42:35.545 --> 00:42:40.025
TALIESIN: I think we can camp on the beach before
we leave town, but if people are anxious to get

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:41.039
this done--

00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:43.304
LAURA: I mean, I can go see my mom alone if you
guys want to--

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:45.482
TRAVIS: No, we're going with you, yeah.

00:42:45.482 --> 00:42:48.480
LIAM: What about tomorrow? Do you want to go
tomorrow? Does she know you're coming?

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.112
LAURA: I cast Sending.

00:42:52.112 --> 00:42:54.522
LIAM: What are you doing?

00:42:54.522 --> 00:42:56.069
LAURA: Hey, Mom.

00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:57.073
LIAM: Who are you talking to?

00:42:57.073 --> 00:43:04.557
LAURA: I'm sort of in the wat-- at the beach right
now. Well, not in the water, but I was wondering

00:43:04.557 --> 00:43:08.154
if you're singing tonight or if you're singing
tomorrow--

00:43:08.154 --> 00:43:10.739
SAM: (buzzer)

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:19.509
MATT: As you continue talking, the voice creeps
through and goes, "Jester, I only received a

00:43:19.509 --> 00:43:29.288
"portion of what you were saying, but I am singing
tonight. Are you nearby?"

00:43:29.288 --> 00:43:34.630
LAURA: (excited gasp) My mom is singing
tonight, you guys.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.816
SAM: Oh, then we should leave the beach and go to
where she is singing.

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.865
TRAVIS: Agreed.

00:43:39.865 --> 00:43:44.064
LAURA: She doesn't sing every night, you know, so
if we miss it, we might miss it for a while.

00:43:44.064 --> 00:43:50.567
SAM: Is this a headlining, prime time night? Or
does she get the off nights and matinées?

00:43:51.042 --> 00:43:53.508
LAURA: No, it's a special occurrence when she
performs.

00:43:53.508 --> 00:43:55.893
SAM: Oh, really? We're very fortunate, then.

00:43:55.893 --> 00:44:00.116
TALIESIN: It also occurs to me, this is an eastern
ocean, isn't it? So it would be a sunrise or a

00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:01.422
sunset for this ocean?

00:44:02.093 --> 00:44:10.044
MATT: This side of the coast, it would be--
because where you are on the ocean, it would be

00:44:10.044 --> 00:44:11.408
setting in the west.

00:44:11.408 --> 00:44:17.540
SAM: Which, we have more than one sun, though,
right? There's multiple suns in the sky?

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.246
MATT: You have multiple moons.

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:22.150
LIAM: Get the map! Where's the map?

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.544
TALIESIN: We need an orrery now to figure this
out. I'm very excited.

00:44:25.544 --> 00:44:30.115
MATT: From the Menagerie Coast, the sun does set
in the ocean.

00:44:30.115 --> 00:44:33.700
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. West coast.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.478
TRAVIS: Well, we should definitely go see Jester's
mom.

00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:41.645
TALIESIN: Without a doubt.

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:47.369
TRAVIS: Listen, the ocean will be here and we've
got plenty of time to come back and fish, all

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:48.386
sorts of stuff.

00:44:48.386 --> 00:44:50.882
SAM: Oh, good, we can come back then later. That's
great.

00:44:50.882 --> 00:44:53.341
TRAVIS: I know, I can feel the disappointment--

00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:55.535
SAM: Because I didn't make it in today!

00:44:55.535 --> 00:45:01.807
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know. But hey, the anticipation
keeps building, right? And then, payoff.

00:45:01.807 --> 00:45:03.251
TRAVIS: It'll be that much more special.

00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:05.906
SAM: Maybe we can buy some new swimwear while
we're in town.

00:45:05.906 --> 00:45:06.979
LAURA: Oh yeah!

00:45:06.979 --> 00:45:08.454
SAM: Or any swimwear.

00:45:08.454 --> 00:45:10.950
LAURA: Because I think your bandages might come
off in the water.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.219
TRAVIS: We'll get you some floaties.

00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:13.158
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

00:45:13.158 --> 00:45:14.927
SAM: They will help me?

00:45:14.927 --> 00:45:16.905
TRAVIS: Yep. They'll sink you like a stone.

00:45:16.905 --> 00:45:20.242
LAURA: You know, Nott, you also have that fabulous
ring. You could just walk out onto the ocean.

00:45:20.242 --> 00:45:23.630
SAM: I know, but I don't know how that works on
moving water.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.469
LAURA: Maybe you should find out!

00:45:25.469 --> 00:45:29.025
LIAM: Seems like it could be potentially
hilarious.

00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:36.392
SAM: If we want to get a good seat, though, I feel
like we should leave now. I need to be up front

00:45:36.392 --> 00:45:38.505
because I can't see over people.

00:45:38.505 --> 00:45:39.543
LAURA: That is true.

00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:40.658
SAM: So we should probably get going.

00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:44.346
TRAVIS: Fair enough, it is getting dark. Let's dry
off, get our clothes back on, and get moving.

00:45:44.346 --> 00:45:51.774
MATT: As you guys gather your things, dusk has set
in, and now the sky shifts from light blue to a

00:45:51.774 --> 00:45:59.838
deep blue and purple on the eastern side as the
oranges, reds, yellows, and pinks begin to

00:45:59.838 --> 00:46:02.184
overtake the western side of the skyline.

00:46:02.184 --> 00:46:07.495
TALIESIN: That's really beautiful. That's amazing.
Does it do this every night? Wow.

00:46:07.495 --> 00:46:14.233
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel a little robbed. It's just
gray and rainy where I'm from, all the time.

00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:17.109
LAURA: Guess you should have come here sooner.

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.850
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.966
TRAVIS: But you get amazing storms, right?
Thunder, lightning.

00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:26.769
MARISHA: Yeah. It snows a lot.

00:46:26.769 --> 00:46:28.460
TRAVIS: It gets foggy here sometimes.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.526
MARISHA: Ah. We have fog.

00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:32.280
TRAVIS: Oh. Well.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:42.061
LIAM: The closest thing I've experienced to this
is inside Jester's backpack. In the dodecahedron.

00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:46.744
LAURA: Oh. I thought you meant the abyss of my
backpack.

00:46:46.744 --> 00:46:48.502
TALIESIN: That's exactly what I thought, too.

00:46:48.502 --> 00:46:55.973
LIAM: There was a lot of baked goods in there,
yeah. Now it's just--

00:46:55.973 --> 00:47:03.628
LAURA: Are you high? Are you high on the ocean?

00:47:03.628 --> 00:47:06.032
TRAVIS: That's just the jellyfish sting taking
effect.

00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:08.464
LIAM: No. It's a good day.

00:47:08.464 --> 00:47:14.261
LAURA: How long of a drive is it-- of a cart ride
is it to the--

00:47:18.491 --> 00:47:22.486
MATT: Are you heading back to the main road, to
one of the entrances to the eastern gate of the

00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:26.172
city? Or are you heading towards the coastline to
the actual wharf itself?

00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:28.549
LAURA: Whatever way is faster.

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:29.642
MATT: Probably the wharf.

00:47:29.642 --> 00:47:31.406
LAURA: Let's do the wharf.

00:47:31.406 --> 00:47:35.338
MATT: Okay. You head along the coastline,
eventually finding your way to where the wall

00:47:35.526 --> 00:47:42.131
itself slowly diminishes in steps. It does extend
out into the ocean, there is no direct path where

00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:46.909
you can walk along the shore and go into the city.
It is specifically marked off. There is an archway

00:47:46.909 --> 00:47:50.419
there that is gated by two of the guards that run
the city.

00:47:51.296 --> 00:47:53.555
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self before we get up
there.

00:47:53.555 --> 00:48:00.620
MATT: Okay. You do see about six zolezzo that are
currently guarding that entrance. The rest of you

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:12.806
see armored guards, varying from the scalemail and
the maroons and muted colors of the townsguard

00:48:12.806 --> 00:48:19.462
you're used to seeing in the Empire. Here, the
zolezzo have a blue and green base, but you can

00:48:19.462 --> 00:48:25.092
see on the armor, each individual zolezzo has
their own unique decoration and flair to it, some

00:48:25.092 --> 00:48:32.936
way of customizing it, making it their own. As
such, even within their own ranks there is a sense

00:48:32.936 --> 00:48:39.588
of color and individuality, and their own armored
senses. That doesn't mean they're not still armed

00:48:39.588 --> 00:48:43.377
and wondering who the fuck you are as you approach
the exterior of the city. As your cart begins to

00:48:43.377 --> 00:48:47.691
approach, four of the six zolezzo immediately
raise their weapons, and they begin to approach.

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:53.020
"Halt! What is your business in Nicodranas?"

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:59.747
LAURA: We came to see the Ruby of the Sea perform
tonight, ha!

00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:08.393
MATT: The one at the front, you can see beneath
his helmet, which has these two bits of chainmail

00:49:08.393 --> 00:49:12.295
that curl open like curtains on each side of his
face. He pulls them out of the way and looks

00:49:12.295 --> 00:49:17.642
forward towards the rest of the crew there. You
can see his darker skin and his thick brow, it's

00:49:17.642 --> 00:49:24.262
almost like a unibrow that sits over sun-dried
lips that are a bit cracked and parched. He

00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:29.015
glances forward, looks over the rest of you and
goes, "The Ruby of the Sea?"

00:49:29.015 --> 00:49:30.151
LAURA: Yeah!

00:49:30.151 --> 00:49:32.963
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:49:32.963 --> 00:49:41.226
LAURA: I'll use the red dice for the Ruby. 15?

00:49:41.226 --> 00:49:44.973
MATT: 15? Okay. He goes, "All right, and where do
you hail from?"

00:49:44.973 --> 00:49:48.999
LAURA: We hail from Port Damali.

00:49:54.099 --> 00:50:03.322
MATT: Port Damali is from the other side, but it's
fine. He goes, "All right. It's roundabout. And

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.382
"you are?"

00:50:04.382 --> 00:50:14.907
LAURA: I am Fiona Fancypants! Theater critic
extraordinaire!

00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:16.790
MATT: Now make a deception check.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:27.023
LAURA: That fell out of my hands, it doesn't
count. Oh, it's the same roll! Shit. Seven.

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:36.365
MATT: He looks back to the rest of the zolezzo,
and they discuss for a moment for themselves, and

00:50:36.365 --> 00:50:41.240
he says, "Well, I apologize, but there is no entry
after dark on this side of the wharf, regardless.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.134
"If you want to enter, you have to enter from the
main gates."

00:50:44.134 --> 00:50:48.625
LAURA: Oh no, but she's performing soon, and we're
going to miss it if we go all the way around!

00:50:48.625 --> 00:50:52.940
MATT: "Well, then you'll have to find some way to
make it through the gate." He holds his hand out.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:02.565
LAURA: (singsong) Here we go, we need some money.
Let's see how much I have. I have five gold to put

00:51:02.565 --> 00:51:04.105
in his hand?

00:51:04.105 --> 00:51:05.916
MATT: You put five gold in his hand?

00:51:05.916 --> 00:51:09.163
LAURA: That's a lot of gold, isn't it. I don't
know, here you go!

00:51:09.163 --> 00:51:18.944
MATT: He shakes it in his palm. "Very well, let
them in." To the side, they have a portcullis that

00:51:18.944 --> 00:51:24.028
is held up by some sort of chain mechanism that is
beyond the wall. They step aside and let you in,

00:51:24.028 --> 00:51:31.317
they usher you through quickly because nobody's
supposed to come through this entrance. As they

00:51:31.317 --> 00:51:37.275
all walk by, you can see them all looking each of
you up and down, taking a mental note of what you

00:51:37.275 --> 00:51:41.512
have on you, who you are, what you look like, as
well as what they perceive to be inside the cart.

00:51:41.512 --> 00:51:46.951
A few strange faces at the cluster of creatures
around Jester and the rather disinterested looking

00:51:46.951 --> 00:51:55.636
owl that's clutching the forearm bracer of
Beauregard. You pass through this archway on the

00:51:55.636 --> 00:52:02.148
exterior wall and immediately look before you, and
you can see the eastern side of the harbor here,

00:52:02.148 --> 00:52:11.445
what is known as the Restless Wharf. Immediately
before you, you can see a plethora of people that

00:52:11.445 --> 00:52:17.795
are walking along this heavy dockside harbor.
There are a number of warehouses and small huts

00:52:17.795 --> 00:52:23.127
and buildings that are built both on the dock and
built along the side of where it adjusts from

00:52:23.127 --> 00:52:31.638
stone and sand into wood and elements that turn
into the docks themselves. You can see tall cranes

00:52:31.638 --> 00:52:38.354
made of wood and cord and rope, some of them ten
feet, some of them 25-30 feet or so, that are in

00:52:38.354 --> 00:52:42.687
the process of either loading or off-loading
various materials from the trade ships that are

00:52:42.687 --> 00:52:49.324
making their way into harbor or loading up to
leave in the morning. You see two or three larger

00:52:49.324 --> 00:52:53.418
guild buildings that tend to be the hubs of
information for those that are coming from the

00:52:53.418 --> 00:52:59.981
docks. There are a few dockmasters that are
walking around who are in the process of taking

00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:04.558
down information of who it is entering or exiting
with their ships, making sure that everything is

00:53:04.558 --> 00:53:09.785
being handled, and you see a number of zolezzo
that are also keeping a close eye. Torches are now

00:53:09.785 --> 00:53:15.866
lit as the sky grows darker, and there's one
that's going through the city and lighting the

00:53:15.866 --> 00:53:23.953
actual oil lanterns that hang on these tall, thin
poles that dot the city that have to be lit at

00:53:23.953 --> 00:53:33.708
dusk. One thing that does catch your eye is, right
towards the center of this harbor where the

00:53:33.708 --> 00:53:38.582
Restless Wharf would be transitioning into what
you know as the Open Quay, which is the other half

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:45.393
of this harbor, there is a massive lighthouse that
sits on this one bit of rock that protrudes where

00:53:45.393 --> 00:53:51.307
the docks come to an end and an element of the
stone floor continues out before breaking off into

00:53:51.307 --> 00:53:57.594
a shelf into the ocean below. You can see this
beautiful lighthouse. You know it as the Mother's

00:53:57.594 --> 00:54:02.269
Lighthouse. It catches your attention
specifically, Caduceus, because the beautiful

00:54:02.269 --> 00:54:09.524
design of this lighthouse, while it seems natural
and a gradual tower-like point on the back side,

00:54:09.524 --> 00:54:15.739
on the northern side, the southern side that faces
the ocean has a 20-foot relief of the upper torso

00:54:15.739 --> 00:54:21.086
of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse
looking out over the ocean. A beautiful sculpture

00:54:21.086 --> 00:54:26.999
with wild hair that tangles and curls around the
shoulders and then merges in with the stonework of

00:54:26.999 --> 00:54:33.764
this lighthouse, but what's unique is the way the
lighthouse itself is placed as it rotates. As the

00:54:33.764 --> 00:54:38.561
light beacon comes across, you watch as the eyes
of the woman flare up as the light passes that

00:54:38.561 --> 00:54:45.512
side of the tower. You recognize, the closer you
get to this area, this large sculpture is that of

00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:51.558
the Wildmother, of Melora. That is where the
Mother's Lighthouse title comes from.

00:54:51.558 --> 00:54:54.009
TALIESIN: How long has it been here for?

00:54:54.009 --> 00:54:57.909
LAURA: As long as I've been alive. I don't know.

00:54:57.909 --> 00:54:59.928
LIAM: That is how long again?

00:54:59.928 --> 00:55:03.977
LAURA: You don't know how old I am, Caleb?

00:55:03.977 --> 00:55:04.922
LIAM: No idea.

00:55:04.922 --> 00:55:09.287
LAURA: I thought it would have been obvious. And I
turn around and walk away.

00:55:12.037 --> 00:55:14.288
TALIESIN: That's beautiful.

00:55:15.014 --> 00:55:22.010
MATT: You guys are making your way through the
Restless Wharf, and getting odd looks from the

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:28.365
side of various sailors and dockhands that are
curious as to who you are and how you made your

00:55:28.365 --> 00:55:36.764
way here. Are you heading directly to--? Okay.
That being the case--

00:55:36.764 --> 00:55:40.217
TRAVIS: This is all very familiar to me.

00:55:40.217 --> 00:55:42.364
MATT: Yeah, you've spent a bit of time here.

00:55:42.364 --> 00:55:44.454
SAM: You've been here before?

00:55:44.454 --> 00:55:45.287
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:55:45.287 --> 00:55:49.997
SAM: When did you meet each other? You and Jes?

00:55:49.997 --> 00:55:52.988
TRAVIS: Well, just on our way up into--

00:55:52.988 --> 00:55:54.649
LAURA: Yeah, a few weeks ago.

00:55:54.649 --> 00:55:58.682
SAM: You were near each other for a while and
didn't know each other?

00:55:58.682 --> 00:56:00.859
LAURA: Well, he grew up in a whole different
city.

00:56:00.859 --> 00:56:04.863
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm from Port Damali, but I had seen
her a couple times in the city.

00:56:04.863 --> 00:56:07.203
LAURA: Well, only after I left here.

00:56:07.203 --> 00:56:11.674
LIAM: How far is Port Damali from here, roughly?

00:56:11.674 --> 00:56:19.385
MATT: It's a little over 400, 450 miles from here.
It's quite a distance.

00:56:19.385 --> 00:56:24.759
MARISHA: It's on like the other side of the--? The
lower part of the continent?

00:56:24.759 --> 00:56:29.601
MATT: Yeah, along the Menagerie Coast, Port Damali
is the westernmost port city, which is why it's

00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:35.086
the largest here. It's the major hub of trade
between all the western bits of civilization--

00:56:35.086 --> 00:56:42.668
Tal'Dorei, Marquet, Issylra-- with the port town
Nicodranas being the furthest east. The two of

00:56:42.668 --> 00:56:48.208
those mark the two endpoints, the bookends of the
Menagerie Coast. There are a few other port towns

00:56:48.208 --> 00:56:52.809
in between, but they're smaller by comparison, and
Nicodranas is about half the size of Port Damali.

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:59.784
TRAVIS: Right. As we're walking through to make it
to Jester's mom's place, any familiar faces

00:56:59.784 --> 00:57:01.630
catching eyes?

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:04.271
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:07.604
TRAVIS: Nine.

00:57:07.604 --> 00:57:16.438
MATT: Nine. Everyone seems to be going about their
business. You are drawing some attention from

00:57:16.438 --> 00:57:24.047
folks as it is their job, there are a few zolezzo
that keep an eye as you pass by. You see one male

00:57:24.047 --> 00:57:28.408
dwarf figure that appears to probably be the
Wharfmaster who has a number of people talking to

00:57:28.408 --> 00:57:32.494
him, who watches you pass by, and as he does so he
scribbles something in a book and then goes about

00:57:32.494 --> 00:57:39.160
his business, but that's the most you notice. You
pass beyond the Restless Wharf heading

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:44.538
north-northwest into the city, eventually the
hustle and bustle of the docks begin to fade, the

00:57:44.538 --> 00:57:50.924
warehouses begin to slowly diminish their
overtaking of the central business area of the

00:57:50.924 --> 00:58:00.534
city, and you come upon a large, 15-foot tall
stone archway. It's a gradual arch as opposed to

00:58:00.534 --> 00:58:07.569
being straight and then turning over, it's a slow,
gradual arch there with a large gem embedded at

00:58:07.569 --> 00:58:09.106
its peak, at its zenith.

00:58:09.106 --> 00:58:11.077
LAURA: The Opal Archway!

00:58:11.077 --> 00:58:12.448
SAM: Opal Archway?

00:58:12.448 --> 00:58:14.283
MATT: There are eleven of these throughout the
district.

00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:18.461
SAM: One of the Opal Archways? Wow.

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:22.919
MATT: These, if you were to recount what
information of history you know about the city

00:58:22.919 --> 00:58:27.638
here, the Opal Archways once marked the-- goddamn
it.

00:58:27.638 --> 00:58:31.023
LAURA: No, you go. I'll just repeat it.

00:58:31.023 --> 00:58:35.986
MATT: There you go. They once marked the exterior
of the original city-- I will fucking kill you.

00:58:35.986 --> 00:58:46.481
Never mind, you don't get lore! I can give and I
can take away! No, the Opal Archways mark what

00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:50.498
were the original boundaries of the city when it
was first founded, and the city has expanded far

00:58:50.498 --> 00:58:55.497
beyond that, but that now marks the richer, most
lively district where a lot of the political

00:58:55.497 --> 00:59:00.111
elite, where a lot of diplomats, and the wealthy
merchants come to either live and/or spend their

00:59:00.111 --> 00:59:09.364
money. You pass beyond this archway, the original,
occasional set poles that hold the oil lanterns

00:59:09.364 --> 00:59:16.347
that give the faint bit of flickering firelight
through these dark cobblestone streets give way to

00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:24.654
much more vibrant, magical baubles that hover
about ten feet above the air. They've already been

00:59:24.654 --> 00:59:29.717
set, and you see them give off a brighter glow,
and the colors seem to shift. One of them has a

00:59:29.717 --> 00:59:36.366
whiter color but then slowly turns to an orange,
then shifts to a green. About ten feet away on the

00:59:36.366 --> 00:59:40.946
other side of the street, you see another one
that's colors are shifting but in a different

00:59:40.946 --> 00:59:46.385
pattern, so they're kind of complementing and also
contrasting each other. At this point, too, you

00:59:46.385 --> 00:59:50.786
begin to see the streets-- while not as crowded as
the wharf, people that are here are much better

00:59:50.786 --> 00:59:55.888
dressed. You see a carriage make its way by to
your right, and you see a few folks that appear to

00:59:55.888 --> 01:00:05.981
be well-dressed nobles of some kind, wearing a
crushed silk-type clothing that is bright blues

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:15.284
and purples, and jewelry of all sorts of gems and
colors. Compared to a lot of the drab decor that a

01:00:15.284 --> 01:00:21.131
lot of the noble families wear in your experiences
up in the Empire, the cultural mishmash that tends

01:00:21.131 --> 01:00:26.304
to build here on the coast over time with so many
people coming from so many places, it all has

01:00:26.304 --> 01:00:33.726
built this mixing pot of styles and ideas and
self-expression, and it immediately is visible in

01:00:33.726 --> 01:00:39.007
the people that live here. You do notice,
strangely, that there are a few townsguard among

01:00:39.007 --> 01:00:40.376
the zolezzo here.

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:41.581
SAM: Townsguard?

01:00:41.581 --> 01:00:44.775
MATT: Crownsguard. Crownsguard of the Empire.

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.230
SAM: Oh, but we're not in the Empire?

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.588
MATT: Correct.

01:00:48.588 --> 01:00:53.551
MARISHA: Do they look like they're working, or do
they look like they're--?

01:00:55.564 --> 01:00:58.806
MATT: They look like they're keeping an eye out,
and you two have had the experience here.

01:00:58.806 --> 01:01:07.774
Crownsguard do have a small presence here. Because
Nicodranas is the closest to the Empire, it's also

01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:14.410
the crossover point where the two entities-- the
Clovis Concord that oversees the Menagerie Coast

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:26.083
and the Dwendalian Empire-- make their laws and
agreements and all of their essential intent to

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:34.664
not attack, undermine, or destroy each other takes
place. So while the laws of the Clovis Concord are

01:01:34.664 --> 01:01:41.603
enforced here, technically the Crownsguard can
enforce imperial law if they were to see anything

01:01:41.603 --> 01:01:46.520
that does break imperial law. However, their
presence is much thinner than anywhere else in the

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:52.522
Empire, and it's more of a courtesy given to them
by the Concord to make them feel more comfortable

01:01:52.522 --> 01:01:57.290
in the city that is closest here. That's largely
why this city here in Nicodranas is considered a

01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:03.284
popular escape for those who want to get away.
It's the Vegas of the Dwendalian Empire, where

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:07.106
it's close enough they can go travel to and still
enjoy a bit of comfort and some semblance of home

01:02:07.106 --> 01:02:12.179
in places, but it's still different and alien and
unique enough to the point where it feels like a vacation.

01:02:12.668 --> 01:02:16.949
TRAVIS: We can tell from their posture that
they're not on leave; they're actually there more

01:02:16.949 --> 01:02:17.754
on duty?

01:02:17.754 --> 01:02:21.441
MATT: They're more on duty, though you're not sure
if it's their own duty or if they've been given

01:02:21.441 --> 01:02:30.323
some sort of post specifically by whoever's paying
them. But it catches the rest of you who aren't

01:02:30.323 --> 01:02:34.559
familiar with this sight a little off-guard, and
you immediately adjust your posture and get into a

01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:39.633
little more of a naturally defensive position,
knowing that there is now <i>two</i> forces of law

01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:42.389
enforcement now looking to the streets of the
Archways.

01:02:42.389 --> 01:02:46.746
LAURA: It's okay, most of the crownsguard here
don't really give a shit. When they get stationed

01:02:46.746 --> 01:02:51.546
out here, they're like, "Okay, okay" and they do
the fun stuff too.

01:02:51.546 --> 01:02:54.273
TRAVIS: It's more of a cush posting.

01:02:54.273 --> 01:02:59.990
MARISHA: Do they give these postings to people who
are fuck-offs? Or do they give these postings to

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:01.137
people who are--

01:03:01.137 --> 01:03:05.841
TRAVIS: No, they're pretty legit. Because
honestly, this is where the bigwigs go, so they

01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:09.148
want the best, right? They're not going to take a
bunch of jack-offs with them.

01:03:09.148 --> 01:03:11.375
MARISHA: Got you. Yeah.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:15.699
SAM: So there's a lot of people with jewelry
around.

01:03:15.699 --> 01:03:18.008
TALIESIN: I was just thinking, I felt a little
underdressed.

01:03:18.008 --> 01:03:20.835
SAM: Should I steal some for you?

01:03:20.835 --> 01:03:27.138
LAURA: Well, here's the thing. You can steal stuff
if you want, Nott, but the laws are enforced a

01:03:27.138 --> 01:03:28.730
little bit stricter here.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:34.295
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Clovis Concord is iron clad.
It's some hefty penalties. Everything from

01:03:34.295 --> 01:03:39.835
stealing to murder puts you away for quite a
while, and it's a hefty fine.

01:03:39.835 --> 01:03:45.118
SAM: All right. I won't steal or murder, then.

01:03:45.118 --> 01:03:50.454
TRAVIS: That whole spectrum in between. You can
fill in everything that happened in your mind when

01:03:50.454 --> 01:03:52.819
I said those two. It applies to that shit as
well.

01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:55.537
LAURA: What else is there, really, between
stealing and murder?

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:56.754
SAM: Arson?

01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:57.884
LAURA: Oh, that's a good one.

01:03:57.884 --> 01:03:58.548
TRAVIS: Kidnapping?

01:03:58.548 --> 01:03:59.749
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:01.594
MARISHA: Are we talking about things in between?

01:04:01.594 --> 01:04:04.427
TRAVIS: Yeah, in between those two.

01:04:04.427 --> 01:04:09.186
MARISHA: So what about mail fraud? Is mail fraud
in there, or is it lesser than stealing?

01:04:09.186 --> 01:04:11.888
SAM: That's the worst. That's the worst crime
there is.

01:04:11.888 --> 01:04:14.636
TALIESIN: No one talks to anyone that commits mail
fraud.

01:04:14.636 --> 01:04:18.226
MARISHA: You are all accomplices. I just want to
point that out.

01:04:18.226 --> 01:04:23.592
SAM: When Caleb and I were in the clink, there was
a guy in there who had committed mail fraud.

01:04:23.592 --> 01:04:24.575
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:04:24.575 --> 01:04:29.097
SAM: He was fucked up by every other prisoner in
there.

01:04:29.097 --> 01:04:30.523
TRAVIS: They don't like them.

01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:32.040
SAM: Marked for death.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.685
TRAVIS: Don't fuck with the postal service.

01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:35.269
SAM: No! That's sacred.

01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:39.201
LIAM: We were the only two people in that cell.

01:04:39.201 --> 01:04:41.762
MARISHA: Were you?

01:04:41.762 --> 01:04:44.469
LIAM: (coughing) That is correct.

01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:47.577
MARISHA: Still got saltwater from where Fjord
goosed you?

01:04:47.577 --> 01:04:50.235
TRAVIS: I shouldn't have surprised you, man, I'm
sorry about that. Shit.

01:04:50.235 --> 01:04:51.846
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that's on you, buddy.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:55.298
TRAVIS: Sorry. You've got to-- nah, I'm not going
to say it.

01:04:55.298 --> 01:05:04.245
MATT: In passing further through the Opal Archways
district, you begin to hear the music of various

01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:08.814
street buskers and performers beginning to take to
the roads. They have their own lighting

01:05:08.814 --> 01:05:21.448
arrangements, and you see a small-- what's the
word for it? A topped cart, a vardo. Thank you.

01:05:21.448 --> 01:05:24.019
LAURA: It was right on the tip of my tongue.

01:05:24.019 --> 01:05:26.924
TALIESIN: It was on the tip of mine, but that's
fair.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:32.371
MATT: Well, it would be on yours. A vardo tucked
into one corner, where there is a small group of

01:05:32.371 --> 01:05:38.031
about four performers out there doing juggling
acts. It reminds you of the early days, when you

01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:44.569
had first come across the carnival in Trostenwald.
Most everyone in the street doesn't pay them mind,

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:51.556
occasional silver is tossed their way. Passing
that still, you go by a building that catches your

01:05:51.556 --> 01:06:02.074
attention immediately. This gaudy, nearly a palace
of an estate. You see this large building, white

01:06:02.074 --> 01:06:12.965
silk-draped, dull brass and orange-yellow stone, a
sandstone base construct of a building. You know

01:06:12.965 --> 01:06:20.082
this. You've passed it before, but you're
uncertain. This is the Marquis Demesne. This is

01:06:20.082 --> 01:06:23.518
where the Marquis of the city lives.

01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:27.800
SAM: Marquis Demesne.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.032
MATT: Even at a glance, you can see that there's
probably well over 40 rooms within this establishment.

01:06:34.154 --> 01:06:36.152
LAURA: We get lots of visitors all the time.

01:06:36.152 --> 01:06:39.042
MARISHA: So it's a big house, like a mansion?

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:45.185
MATT: It looks like a small compound, with three
low towers, four or five story towers, two at the

01:06:45.185 --> 01:06:50.241
front and one towards the back that's the taller
of the three. All one singular building. It looks

01:06:50.241 --> 01:06:57.589
like a palace. Small for a palace, but too large
for a mansion. It's that weird, in-between state.

01:06:57.589 --> 01:07:02.502
A lot of money has gone into its construction, and
the closer you get to it, you can see that maybe

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:09.441
it's not in the best of upkeep. But what you do
notice is that the presence of Zolezzo is very

01:07:09.441 --> 01:07:15.601
strong. There's probably about 20 or more zolezzo
that are in the process of keeping an eye on the

01:07:15.601 --> 01:07:23.178
vicinity, walking around the boundaries of the
exterior of the Demesne. You can see eight or so

01:07:23.178 --> 01:07:30.939
that are stationed at the front, and a few that
are walking along the upper parapets or high

01:07:30.939 --> 01:07:33.270
walls, keeping an eye down on the street.

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:35.958
LAURA: Does it seem like the same amount that's
always been there?

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:42.679
MATT: Yeah. It can vary, but you get the sense--
Make a history check, actually.

01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:47.528
LAURA: 13!

01:07:49.545 --> 01:07:56.555
MATT: You get the sense that there's probably a
handful of diplomats that are staying there as

01:07:56.555 --> 01:07:59.690
guests, and that's why the guard is a little more
heightened than normal.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:02.619
LAURA: (whispering) There's probably diplomats
there tonight.

01:08:02.619 --> 01:08:04.093
MARISHA: Wartime.

01:08:04.093 --> 01:08:16.286
MATT: As you curve around the bend of the exterior
of Demesne, you see before you what is considered

01:08:16.286 --> 01:08:25.616
the high-end inn of the Opal Archways. You see
this beautiful, three-story, thin but very tall

01:08:25.616 --> 01:08:34.540
building of soft, sky blue pigment that's been
painted across the stone, and each windowsill you

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:42.412
can see this gold-leafed wooden frame, that
dangling from it is a deep cerulean, crushed

01:08:42.412 --> 01:08:48.187
velvet curtain that open up across glass windows
that appear to be stained glass, and glowing from

01:08:48.187 --> 01:08:54.570
the inside, emanate this slightly shifting
kaleidoscope of color from the inside out. The

01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:59.580
steps that lead up to the front double doors,
which are currently open, emanate a very soft

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:07.518
sound of music: a four, five piece band,
apparently, playing gentle, atmospheric music to

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:13.548
the interior. This is a very familiar sight to
you, Jester, as this is the Lavish Chateau. This

01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:16.408
is where you grew up. This is your home.

01:09:16.408 --> 01:09:18.527
LAURA: She hasn't started yet! You guys!

01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:21.004
SAM: I hear music; is that the warm-up act?

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.963
LAURA: Sure, but if you don't hear singing, she
hasn't gone yet!

01:09:23.963 --> 01:09:25.743
TRAVIS: Do we have to pay to get in?

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:29.000
LAURA: No? I never had to.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.778
SAM: Well, you lived there.

01:09:30.778 --> 01:09:33.199
LAURA: So yeah, it's probably free.

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:34.875
SAM: Is this a hotel?

01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:35.595
LAURA: Yeah!

01:09:35.595 --> 01:09:37.159
SAM: You grew up in a hotel?

01:09:37.159 --> 01:09:41.475
LAURA: Well, I mean, it wasn't a hotel to me. We
had a lot of the top floor.

01:09:41.475 --> 01:09:47.187
LIAM: But under normal circumstances, because you
look this way, but would everyone know you here?

01:09:47.187 --> 01:09:56.061
LAURA: You mean like as a human? Or would they
know me as a me?

01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:59.765
SAM: As Jester. Do they know you?

01:09:59.765 --> 01:10:01.417
LAURA: Well, yeah, of course they would.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.432
SAM: But you don't want them to see you, so how
will we get in?

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:04.648
LAURA: Well, I'm disguised.

01:10:04.648 --> 01:10:06.043
SAM: I know, but how will we get in?

01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:07.967
TRAVIS: What was your name again? Fiona
Fancypants?

01:10:07.967 --> 01:10:08.860
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.187
TRAVIS: Okay. Just Fiona.

01:10:10.187 --> 01:10:10.949
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:10.949 --> 01:10:13.091
MATT: You know Disguise Self lasts an hour,
right?

01:10:13.091 --> 01:10:14.505
LAURA: Has it been an hour?

01:10:14.505 --> 01:10:19.664
MATT: It's been over an hour. But I'll say that
you've kept it up, but mark off two more 1st-level

01:10:19.664 --> 01:10:23.035
spell slots for the time it's taken to travel
since you arrived at the ocean.

01:10:23.035 --> 01:10:25.122
LAURA: Well, two more since-- wait.

01:10:25.122 --> 01:10:28.747
MATT: From traveling from the ocean to the city,
and making your way through, it's been the better

01:10:28.747 --> 01:10:31.464
part of an hour, so it would be two spell slots.

01:10:31.464 --> 01:10:35.970
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:40.836
MATT: Yeah, a little over an hour since you left
the beach.

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.832
LAURA: I just recast it.

01:10:42.832 --> 01:10:46.217
SAM: Sure. Well, then, how are we going to get
in?

01:10:46.217 --> 01:10:52.120
LAURA: What do you mean, how are we going to get
in? We go in. They don't know you; they know me.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.285
And I don't even look like me.

01:10:53.285 --> 01:10:55.029
SAM: I'm going to Disguise Self, too.

01:10:55.029 --> 01:10:57.112
TRAVIS: Do they check weapons at the door,
anything like that?

01:10:57.112 --> 01:11:06.878
MATT: From what you recall, they request weapons
be noted. You can keep <i>a</i> weapon on your person,

01:11:06.878 --> 01:11:13.873
as a means of self-defense, but you cannot come in
fully decked out, ready for armor. You can have

01:11:13.873 --> 01:11:17.899
one small personal item on yourself as a means of
self-defense. Everything else can be kept at a

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:23.838
coat room at the entrance. You also do see two
zolezzo that are stationed on either side of the

01:11:23.838 --> 01:11:29.253
open doorway that is part of the protective
presence here at the inn and the higher-end

01:11:29.253 --> 01:11:31.407
customers that they see.

01:11:31.407 --> 01:11:36.077
LIAM: Before entering, I would look for an
alleyway in the last few minutes before getting

01:11:36.386 --> 01:11:42.796
here to make all of my clothes look-- I cast
Disguise Self on myself, and don't change my

01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:47.211
appearance other than to make my clothes look
brand new and slightly more expensive than they are.

01:11:47.211 --> 01:11:49.644
TALIESIN: I may join you in that, if that's all
right.

01:11:49.644 --> 01:11:50.890
LIAM: By all means.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:55.840
TALIESIN: I'll also humanize myself and put
together something that looks appropriate for the

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.832
sort of people I've seen walking around. Lot of
pearlescent whites and greens.

01:12:00.832 --> 01:12:02.476
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:03.895
TALIESIN: Oh, this'll go poorly.

01:12:03.895 --> 01:12:05.063
TRAVIS: You're still very tall.

01:12:05.063 --> 01:12:05.973
TALIESIN: No, I'm not.

01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:06.994
MATT: He can adjust his height.

01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:08.058
TALIESIN: One foot up and down.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:09.165
LAURA: What?

01:12:09.165 --> 01:12:10.449
MATT: That's part of the Disguise Self ability
that he has.

01:12:10.449 --> 01:12:11.994
LAURA: I thought it was just a thing.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.087
MATT: No, it's a racial trait of a firbolg.

01:12:14.087 --> 01:12:18.497
TALIESIN: Straight intelligence check? 14.

01:12:18.497 --> 01:12:25.891
MATT: Okay. You've taken a bit of time to study
the accouterments and fashion of those around you

01:12:25.891 --> 01:12:32.927
in the city, specifically those that appear to be
common denizens of Nicodranas. As you emerge with

01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:42.338
Caleb, you see Caleb in this beautifully clean,
well-pressed coat, with a higher collar, a wider

01:12:42.338 --> 01:12:50.378
sleeve, and with cuff. You can see a bit of a
cravat poofing from beneath. A very nice presence.

01:12:50.378 --> 01:12:54.750
And you see, with the same pink hair-- how would
you like to be dressed?

01:12:54.750 --> 01:13:01.188
TALIESIN: Definitely the same pink hair, but tied
back. He's a thin, adult human man who's got a

01:13:01.188 --> 01:13:09.632
little bit of a scruff going into a bit of a
shaggy goatee. If this is appropriate for it, a

01:13:09.632 --> 01:13:15.044
little bit of the French Restoration, but nice,
pale, opalescent whites.

01:13:15.044 --> 01:13:16.576
MARISHA: I keep imagining Lord Strider.

01:13:16.576 --> 01:13:24.417
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Okay, yes, that's fair. It's
muted, but fun.

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:34.238
SAM: I will also cast Disguise Self and turn into
a female dwarf with a simple muumuu.

01:13:34.238 --> 01:13:36.501
TRAVIS: A simple what?

01:13:36.501 --> 01:13:38.025
SAM: A muumuu.

01:13:38.025 --> 01:13:42.133
LIAM: Don't insult my dignity; just give me the
muumuu!

01:13:42.133 --> 01:13:45.520
MATT: All right. So you almost look like one of
the ghosts from Pac-Man.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.360
SAM: A blue muumuu.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.600
MATT: Okay, perfect.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.352
MARISHA: Is that Blinky? I think that was Blinky.

01:13:53.352 --> 01:14:02.885
MATT: As you approach and begin to step out of the
cart, you see a young human man in his early 20s

01:14:02.885 --> 01:14:09.792
or so, his hair gelled back, but it tends to curl
up and poof a bit towards the base and around the

01:14:09.792 --> 01:14:18.263
sides of his neck. He's wearing a vest with a
plain but well-made silk white shirt and a pair of

01:14:18.263 --> 01:14:26.460
trousers. You recognize him as Tyral. He is
essentially the front hand of the inn. As he

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:31.812
approaches, he looks up to you. "Are you leaving
your cart here? Are you going to be staying?"

01:14:31.812 --> 01:14:33.975
LAURA: Yes, we're going to be staying here.

01:14:33.975 --> 01:14:39.761
MATT: "All right. Well, I will see that this is
taken care of. Please, enter."

01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:41.371
MARISHA: Do you board animals?

01:14:41.371 --> 01:14:46.908
MATT: "We can. There is a charge."

01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:49.481
MARISHA: Cool. Here's the pigeon he's been
eating.

01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:50.873
SAM: Seagull.

01:14:50.873 --> 01:14:52.496
MARISHA: Sorry, it's a seagull.

01:14:52.496 --> 01:15:06.834
MATT: "Um." Sets it on the railing of the stairway
on the side, and goes, "Very well. I will see and

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:11.304
"tend to the horses and your hawk?"

01:15:11.304 --> 01:15:12.974
MARISHA: Professor.

01:15:12.974 --> 01:15:14.336
LAURA: It's an owl.

01:15:14.336 --> 01:15:16.578
MATT: "Ow! Ow! Ow!"

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:18.229
TRAVIS: That sucks!

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:23.309
LAURA: What is that for?

01:15:23.309 --> 01:15:24.908
SAM: Other pets?

01:15:24.908 --> 01:15:27.470
LAURA: No, that's for money.

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:30.061
MATT: "This is actually to pay for the service."

01:15:30.061 --> 01:15:33.052
MARISHA: Here. I pay him. How much is it?

01:15:33.052 --> 01:15:36.374
MATT: He doesn't say. How much do you give him?

01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:39.594
MARISHA: For the service of boarding the animals?

01:15:39.594 --> 01:15:42.099
MATT: Boarding the animals and taking care of the
cart.

01:15:42.099 --> 01:15:46.127
MARISHA: I give him five gold, because I saw
Jester do that earlier and it seems to be the

01:15:46.127 --> 01:15:48.298
common courtesy of Nicodranas.

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:52.025
MATT: All right. You drop five gold in his hand,
and his eyes go wide. He's like, "Oh, of course!"

01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:53.794
MARISHA: Was that a lot of money?

01:15:53.794 --> 01:15:55.061
MATT: "Right this way!"

01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:56.912
LAURA: For this particular thing, I think it was.

01:15:56.912 --> 01:15:58.592
TALIESIN: That's a lot of happiness, and that's
okay!

01:15:58.592 --> 01:16:01.145
LAURA: It looks like we're really well off,
though, that's good.

01:16:01.145 --> 01:16:04.196
MATT: He seems to be immediately swallowing the
pain from the talons that are grinding into his

01:16:04.196 --> 01:16:09.395
forearm, and is now smiling brightly and eager to
please the new arrivals on the outskirts.

01:16:09.395 --> 01:16:11.436
TRAVIS: There's more where that came from if you
take good care of them.

01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.363
TALIESIN: Lighten up a bit.

01:16:13.363 --> 01:16:17.306
SAM: What about the other animals?

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.574
LAURA: They're staying with me. I'm not giving
these things up.

01:16:20.574 --> 01:16:22.895
SAM: You're walking in with a dog and a weasel?

01:16:22.895 --> 01:16:30.784
LAURA: Well, the weasel is tucked in, so really no
one will notice it. But yes, I'm walking in with a dog.

01:16:31.069 --> 01:16:31.911
SAM: Okay, all right.

01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:33.023
LIAM: Yeah, it's like a lap dog.

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:34.661
LAURA: My mom will want to meet him!

01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:35.574
SAM: Sure. Okay!

01:16:35.574 --> 01:16:37.664
TRAVIS: The dog's going to piss everywhere.

01:16:37.664 --> 01:16:39.641
LAURA: No, blink dogs don't pee.

01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:40.286
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:16:40.286 --> 01:16:42.452
LAURA: It's a rule. It's canon!

01:16:42.452 --> 01:16:45.421
SAM: Have you named the weasel yet?

01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:46.116
LAURA: Yeah!

01:16:46.116 --> 01:16:48.560
MATT: As she's saying this, a dark spot is slowly
spreading across.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.234
TRAVIS: Yeah! You just got peed on! Beautiful.

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:54.605
LAURA: His name is Sprinkle.

01:16:54.605 --> 01:16:55.329
SAM: Sprinkle?

01:16:55.329 --> 01:16:56.193
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:56.193 --> 01:16:57.704
SAM: Sprinkle the weasel.

01:16:57.704 --> 01:16:58.692
MATT: It is a male.

01:16:58.692 --> 01:17:01.785
LIAM: Sprinkle and Nugget and Professor Thaddeus.
Excellent.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:03.925
TALIESIN: I named the seagull in my head, too.

01:17:03.925 --> 01:17:05.080
LIAM: What's the name?

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:05.986
TALIESIN: Steven.

01:17:05.986 --> 01:17:07.845
MATT: It would be a Steven.

01:17:07.845 --> 01:17:09.432
TALIESIN: Steven Seagull.

01:17:09.432 --> 01:17:12.666
MARISHA: Steven Seagull. That's good.

01:17:12.666 --> 01:17:16.060
TRAVIS: Oh, yes! I got to give it up.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:26.016
MATT: Your cart is taken care of, one of your
animals has found a temporary companion. You make

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:31.924
your way up the steps. The zolezzo keep an eye out
and nod as you pass, walking into the interior.

01:17:31.924 --> 01:17:40.747
The warm, light, and music embrace you as you step
within the Lavish Chateau. The first thing you see

01:17:40.747 --> 01:17:46.625
are four chandeliers hanging from the ceiling in
different corners of this very tall chamber, about

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:53.328
15 or so feet from floor to ceiling. There are
rafters that align with a series of wide wooden

01:17:53.328 --> 01:17:58.297
bars that hang from the right to left side, and
the chandeliers that hang from them appear to be

01:17:58.297 --> 01:18:04.541
made of a polished silver color and on them hang
about 20 or so candles per chandelier that are

01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:12.362
giving off this gently flickering, warm light that
trickles down into the main area. You see two

01:18:12.362 --> 01:18:17.343
bars, one to the right and one to the left in the
far corners, with each being tended to by one

01:18:17.343 --> 01:18:26.150
bartender. You see a few servants that are jogging
from table to table and ten or so tables. You're

01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:33.738
used to the dark wood taverns and the dives in
various degrees. All the tables here have fine,

01:18:33.738 --> 01:18:43.475
very high-count white cotton or a white dupioni
silk that is pulled across and around these

01:18:43.475 --> 01:18:53.318
circular tables, and across them a silver platter
that contains candles, fresh fruit, complimentary

01:18:53.318 --> 01:18:59.123
slivers of cheese and crackers that are set out
there. There aren't a lot of people in here.

01:18:59.123 --> 01:19:06.282
There's maybe nine patrons that are currently in
the tavern, but those that are in here are very

01:19:06.282 --> 01:19:15.508
well dressed. They're clustered around three
separate tables: three, three and three at three

01:19:15.508 --> 01:19:16.495
different tables.

01:19:16.495 --> 01:19:19.736
LIAM: I'm a heathen. What is dupioni silk?

01:19:19.736 --> 01:19:24.580
MATT: Dupioni silk. It's a type of silk material
that has an interesting texture to it.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.952
LIAM: Okay.

01:19:26.952 --> 01:19:28.271
MATT: I'll show you at the break!

01:19:28.271 --> 01:19:29.276
LIAM: I was just curious.

01:19:29.967 --> 01:19:33.054
LAURA: It's really pretty. It's basically the
nicest kind you can get. It's really fancy.

01:19:33.054 --> 01:19:39.954
LIAM: Is it like the velour Juicy sweatpants that
I saw when I first moved here?

01:19:39.954 --> 01:19:44.138
MARISHA: I'm going to Google it! Dip-i-- how do
you spell it?

01:19:44.138 --> 01:19:48.073
TALIESIN: Everybody at home gets out their swatch
they got.

01:19:48.073 --> 01:19:53.689
MATT: It looks a little rougher than just smooth
silk. It has a bit of a texture to it, and it

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:55.523
looks a little more natural.

01:19:55.523 --> 01:19:57.560
LIAM: Legitimately just curious.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.931
MATT: There you go.

01:19:58.931 --> 01:20:02.231
MARISHA: It's shiny. It's shiny silk.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:06.741
TRAVIS: You said with those nine people that are
in the room, how many tables are there about?

01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:11.190
LIAM: That's dupioni silk? I knew that! Dupioni.
Bob Dupioni.

01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:15.150
MATT: Exactly! You see ten tables in the room
total.

01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:16.580
TRAVIS: Ten tables.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:25.165
MATT: Yes. Though the clientele can shift based on
time. As you enter and look around, on the far end

01:20:25.174 --> 01:20:31.221
there is a single staircase, a wide ten-foot
staircase, that ascends up towards the back wall

01:20:31.221 --> 01:20:35.723
and then splits in two different sides into two
separate staircases that ascend to the second

01:20:35.723 --> 01:20:44.139
level. Along that, you can see all the wood
painted in a faint gray or very light tan color.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:50.849
There is a carpeting that is draped over the
center, about eight-foot wide down the staircase,

01:20:50.849 --> 01:20:57.645
that is a similar light blue color as the paint on
the exterior of the building.

01:20:58.027 --> 01:20:59.774
LAURA: Isn't it pretty?

01:20:59.774 --> 01:21:01.816
SAM: It's beautiful.

01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:04.536
LAURA: I used to run up and down these stairs late
at night.

01:21:04.536 --> 01:21:10.465
SAM: Can you remind me, so I don't call her Mrs.
Ruby-- what's your mom's name? What do we call

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:12.486
her? Miss Lavorre? Mrs. Lavorre?

01:21:12.486 --> 01:21:14.153
LAURA: Or Marion.

01:21:14.153 --> 01:21:16.732
SAM: Marion? Okay.

01:21:16.732 --> 01:21:20.012
LIAM: Is blue the predominant color here?

01:21:20.012 --> 01:21:27.831
MATT: On the exterior, yes. On the interior, it's
a light tan and medium wood tint with whites and

01:21:27.831 --> 01:21:29.531
gold and silver.

01:21:29.531 --> 01:21:34.237
TRAVIS: Fiona, do you recognize anyone in this
room?

01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.781
LAURA: Yeah!

01:21:35.781 --> 01:21:37.099
TRAVIS: You do?

01:21:37.099 --> 01:21:41.674
LAURA: I do. Sure, I recognize that bartender and
that bartender and--

01:21:41.674 --> 01:21:44.871
TRAVIS: But I meant the patrons. Anybody that--?

01:21:44.871 --> 01:21:48.419
LAURA: Yep. A couple of them have been upstairs,
if you know what I mean.

01:21:48.419 --> 01:21:50.209
TALIESIN: I don't!

01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:52.983
SAM: Her mother is a lady of the night.

01:21:52.983 --> 01:21:54.495
TALIESIN: Ah! Oh.

01:21:54.495 --> 01:21:57.716
LAURA: <i>The</i> lady of the night, if you will!

01:21:57.833 --> 01:22:00.608
SAM: She's the best lay ever.

01:22:00.608 --> 01:22:05.535
LAURA: Yeah, and considering that she's singing
tonight, it seems really empty in here! What's

01:22:05.535 --> 01:22:06.569
that about?

01:22:06.569 --> 01:22:08.017
MARISHA: Maybe it's a private show?

01:22:08.017 --> 01:22:12.895
LAURA: She doesn't do that. It would cost a lot of
money!

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:17.389
SAM: Well, maybe it wasn't publicized. Maybe it's
a surprise drop-in show.

01:22:17.389 --> 01:22:19.017
LAURA: What?!

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:27.586
MATT: As you guys have been standing in the middle
of the foyer area, you're pushed ahead by another

01:22:27.586 --> 01:22:34.756
group of about four individuals. They look to be
merchants, well-dressed for the occasion, and they

01:22:34.756 --> 01:22:39.568
push passed. "Ah, excuse me." They go and find
another table, and you get the sense that the room

01:22:39.568 --> 01:22:42.380
probably is going to be filling up.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:47.379
LAURA: We should probably get a table as soon as
possible. Where's the backstage door? Where do I

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:48.935
get to my mom?

01:22:48.935 --> 01:22:53.013
MATT: Your mom actually descends for her
performance, so you'd have to go upstairs.

01:22:53.013 --> 01:22:54.785
LAURA: I want to go upstairs.

01:22:54.785 --> 01:22:56.100
MATT: Okay. Just you?

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.062
LAURA: Yeah.

01:22:57.062 --> 01:22:58.847
MATT: All right. So you guys all find a table?

01:22:58.847 --> 01:22:59.837
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:22:59.837 --> 01:23:02.205
TRAVIS: Yeah. Is it better near the front, or in
the back?

01:23:02.205 --> 01:23:06.228
LAURA: Well, she comes down from those stairs, so
make sure you got a good view of that.

01:23:06.228 --> 01:23:08.094
TRAVIS: We'll get as close to the stairs as
possible.

01:23:08.096 --> 01:23:15.431
MATT: Okay. You guys all find a table. You ascend
the stairs with the normal route you're used to

01:23:15.486 --> 01:23:20.428
taking, which is to the right of the stairs' split
towards the second floor. You can see on the brief

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:25.162
landing before it goes up to the second floor
there is another zolezzo guard who's stationed

01:23:25.162 --> 01:23:31.803
there, keeping an eye out. He looks to you, nods.
You run up to the secondary floor, where there are

01:23:31.803 --> 01:23:37.652
a number of various rooms for the inn that are for
rent. You head up the next flight of stairs. As

01:23:37.652 --> 01:23:44.469
they both meet in the center, there's this second
flight that mirrors the bottom floor parallel on

01:23:44.469 --> 01:23:49.212
the floor upward. That one splits again on the top
floor, and there, as you get to the third and

01:23:49.212 --> 01:23:55.528
final floor of the chateau, on the left side there
are a number of inn doors, but there is one

01:23:55.528 --> 01:24:04.027
doorway that is made of a different wood grain
than the rest of them. It was a gift from a very

01:24:04.027 --> 01:24:10.192
interested suitor years ago and it has been
installed, but it marks the chamber where the Ruby

01:24:10.192 --> 01:24:15.230
of the Sea makes her home, and for most of your
life until recently, you made yours.

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:18.197
LAURA: I go up to it!

01:24:18.197 --> 01:24:20.241
MATT: Okay. You go up to the door.

01:24:20.241 --> 01:24:21.526
SAM: We stay downstairs, right?

01:24:21.526 --> 01:24:23.569
LIAM: I buy the group a round.

01:24:23.569 --> 01:24:25.031
TALIESIN: Aw!

01:24:25.031 --> 01:24:31.825
MATT: You can hear, muffled through the doorway, a
little bit of practiced singing. Some scales, some

01:24:31.825 --> 01:24:37.715
"La la la la la!" You hear other voices talking
and there's some rustling moving through. Someone

01:24:37.715 --> 01:24:42.290
seems to stub a toe and goes, "Ow! We're
trying--!" And there's a few other people rushing

01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:43.522
around in there.

01:24:43.522 --> 01:24:50.923
LAURA: I knock on the door and say: Good evening,
Marion Lavorre! The Little Sapphire has come to

01:24:50.923 --> 01:24:52.582
see you!

01:24:52.582 --> 01:25:01.795
MATT: There's a pause and the door creaks open.
You can see one of the servants who works within

01:25:01.795 --> 01:25:09.519
the chateau: an older woman in her forties, human
with very short, crimped dark hair who generally

01:25:09.519 --> 01:25:14.228
helps prep your mother, helps her get dressed and
helps get her prepared for the performance.

01:25:14.288 --> 01:25:22.750
Glances past. Her name is-- actually, let me look
it up. Nadine. She peeks through, looking at you,

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.825
"I'm terribly sorry, what did you say?"

01:25:25.825 --> 01:25:28.626
LAURA: I'm here to see the Ruby of the Sea.

01:25:28.626 --> 01:25:32.713
MATT: "Unfortunately, she is going to be
performing shortly."

01:25:32.713 --> 01:25:35.069
LAURA: I know, tell her that I'm here.

01:25:35.069 --> 01:25:38.341
MATT: "She is not--"

01:25:38.341 --> 01:25:42.510
LAURA: I know, tell her. Tell her. (shouting) The
Little Sapphire's here to see you, Ruby!

01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:50.078
MATT: You hear a voice from behind her go, "I'm
sorry, what?" From peeking over her shoulder as

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:56.058
your vision focuses into the chamber beyond, low
lit beyond the series of candles that are set

01:25:56.058 --> 01:26:03.635
around the single mirror. You see the beautiful
red skin of your mother and the dark hair tumbled

01:26:03.635 --> 01:26:09.545
past the shoulder as she's been wearing a mostly
laced up bodice, as the other servant is in the

01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:15.002
process of lacing and tying it. Glances over her
shoulder and pushes past the edge of the chair.

01:26:15.002 --> 01:26:16.731
LAURA: It's me!

01:26:16.731 --> 01:26:25.214
MATT: You see her smile brightly, her faintly
white glowing hint of yellowish-gold tint to her

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:32.315
eyes brighten immediately and goes, "Well, come
in! Please, close the door."

01:26:32.315 --> 01:26:34.451
LAURA: Excuse me, Nadine.

01:26:34.451 --> 01:26:39.517
MATT: Nadine closes the door and goes, "I'm very
confused by this, Mistress, but whatever you

01:26:39.517 --> 01:26:44.246
"require." At which point, the other one who's
lacing is still pulling on the back of the bodice,

01:26:44.246 --> 01:26:48.675
and without even looking at her Marion pushes her
aside, "Shh."

01:26:48.675 --> 01:26:51.222
LAURA: I run forward and give her a big hug.

01:26:51.222 --> 01:27:01.057
MATT: As you give her a hug, she holds you there
and goes, "You look different."

01:27:01.057 --> 01:27:07.576
LAURA: (whispers) It's a spell! I'm actually still
me, don't worry.

01:27:07.576 --> 01:27:16.128
MATT: There's a nod and the tension in her body
melts as her arms close around your shoulders and

01:27:16.128 --> 01:27:24.778
back and pulls you in close. This moment of warmth
and relief that washes over both of you and being

01:27:24.778 --> 01:27:30.749
reunited here in this chamber. The two servants
sit in the back, awkwardly not quite understanding

01:27:30.749 --> 01:27:36.438
entirely either and whispering to each other,
while Marion continues to hold you and rock you

01:27:36.438 --> 01:27:41.037
back and forth. "My beautiful Jester, I have
missed you so much."

01:27:41.037 --> 01:27:46.124
LAURA: I missed you so much! I wanted to come
home sooner, but we got distracted because

01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:47.704
we went to the Empire.

01:27:47.704 --> 01:27:50.825
MATT: "I remember you telling me you telling me
you were going to go there."

01:27:50.825 --> 01:27:53.343
LAURA: Oh that's right, I sent you messages!
Yeah!

01:27:53.343 --> 01:27:57.693
MATT: "How was it? I have not traveled beyond the
boundaries."

01:27:57.693 --> 01:28:06.113
LAURA: It's really cold and the people are pretty
strict, but there's some really nice people that

01:28:06.113 --> 01:28:08.885
you can meet. I met a lot of friends! You should
meet them.

01:28:08.885 --> 01:28:10.486
MATT: "I'd be happy to."

01:28:10.486 --> 01:28:11.560
LAURA: They're downstairs!

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.186
MATT: She traces her fingers down your face.

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:17.253
LAURA: Here! I put her hand on my horn so she can
tell it's there.

01:28:17.253 --> 01:28:23.868
MATT: She feels it. "Can I see my little girl?"

01:28:23.868 --> 01:28:26.010
LAURA: Is it okay with--?

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:34.959
MATT: "They're fine." You drop the illusion and
even though she knew, it wasn't until she gets an

01:28:34.959 --> 01:28:40.284
opportunity to look upon your face, and your hair,
and your eyes, and your smile that you watch life

01:28:40.284 --> 01:28:45.920
breathe in like a renewed fire into the chest of
your mother. Immediately she grabs the sides of

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.973
your cheeks and pulls you in, "I've missed you so
much." Brings you in, and kisses you on the

01:28:49.973 --> 01:28:52.753
forehead, and starts running her fingers through
your hair.

01:28:52.753 --> 01:28:59.097
LAURA: Be careful of the weasel. His name is
Sprinkle, Mama.

01:28:59.097 --> 01:29:01.572
MATT: "He is very adorable."

01:29:01.572 --> 01:29:05.288
LAURA: I'm going to say I left Nugget downstairs
with you guys.

01:29:05.288 --> 01:29:06.719
MARISHA: Okay.

01:29:06.719 --> 01:29:08.064
TRAVIS: After he peed on you?

01:29:08.064 --> 01:29:09.111
LAURA: Yeah.

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:14.088
MATT: She immediately starts brushing your hair
with her fingers on the side, "You've gone so far

01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:16.721
"and traveled so much. You have to tell me about
what you've done."

01:29:16.721 --> 01:29:20.827
LAURA: I will of course! Do you want me to finish
lacing you up? Your performance is tonight.

01:29:20.827 --> 01:29:27.846
MATT: "Yes, it is, please. Do not mind, she knows
what to do." Now in front of the mirror with you

01:29:27.846 --> 01:29:30.465
behind her, she's looking at you through the
mirror over her shoulder as you're helping

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.398
lace up the back of her bodice.

01:29:32.398 --> 01:29:36.081
LAURA: We went to a town, and it was burned down
and we killed a bunch of gnolls and we took off

01:29:36.081 --> 01:29:42.150
their ears. Then we went to another city and we
fought these fish people in this swamp and it was

01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:48.037
really crazy. Oh my gosh, you should meet this
monk girl that I know. She's crazy and she fights

01:29:48.037 --> 01:29:53.808
with her fists and also with a staff and she's
really strong. There's this other girl who has

01:29:53.808 --> 01:29:56.698
wings. And I tell her all about it.

01:29:56.698 --> 01:30:04.399
MATT: She's enthralled, listening to all this.
"I would never have thought my little Jester

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:09.443
"would be seeing the world and fighting
creatures."

01:30:09.443 --> 01:30:12.682
LAURA: Fighting so much; you should see how strong
I've gotten.

01:30:12.682 --> 01:30:14.410
MATT: "I want to see how strong you've gotten."

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:18.116
LAURA: Well, I mean, okay. Do you want me to punch
you?

01:30:18.116 --> 01:30:29.119
MATT: "Perhaps, wait until after the performance?
I've just applied my-- anyway." At that point she

01:30:29.119 --> 01:30:37.271
stands up and Nadine helps her put the rest of her
dress on. It's this beautiful deep purple,

01:30:37.271 --> 01:30:48.059
satin-type material. It's low-cut with this
beautiful, long, training sleeve that hangs down

01:30:48.059 --> 01:30:57.795
past her knees when her arms are at her side. Puts
on her necklace, a faint velvet choker that pulls

01:30:57.795 --> 01:31:03.245
across the back of the neck there and in the
center is a small blue gem that she keeps to

01:31:03.245 --> 01:31:10.448
remind herself of you. She takes a moment to look
in the mirror, "Well, how do I look?"

01:31:10.448 --> 01:31:12.887
LAURA: You look beautiful, Mama.

01:31:12.887 --> 01:31:17.538
MATT: "Then perhaps you should go join your
friends."

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:25.898
LAURA: Oh right, I can't disguise myself anymore,
though. Can I borrow a cloak or something?

01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:31.924
MATT: "Perhaps." You can technically spend higher
spell slots to cast a lower level spell.

01:31:31.924 --> 01:31:33.509
LAURA: Shit.

01:31:33.509 --> 01:31:35.103
MATT: If you want to, it's up to you.

01:31:35.103 --> 01:31:37.893
LAURA: Okay, that's all that I'll do. I'll cast it
again.

01:31:37.893 --> 01:31:39.207
MATT: Okay.

01:31:39.207 --> 01:31:41.287
TRAVIS: You're going to see a show, what could
happen?

01:31:41.287 --> 01:31:46.535
LAURA: All my spell slots. Okay. I run back
downstairs.

01:31:46.535 --> 01:31:49.944
MATT: Okay, you run back downstairs join the rest.
All right.

01:31:49.944 --> 01:31:51.865
MARISHA: We still have Caduceus. Yeah.

01:31:51.865 --> 01:31:56.685
LAURA: She's almost ready! She's so beautiful.

01:31:56.685 --> 01:32:00.129
TRAVIS: That's great! Was she happy to see you?

01:32:00.129 --> 01:32:03.066
LAURA: Yeah, no, of course she was.

01:32:03.066 --> 01:32:09.238
SAM: Is she going to give us a place to stay
tonight?

01:32:09.238 --> 01:32:13.288
LAURA: Sure! Yes, of course she is. Yeah.

01:32:13.288 --> 01:32:20.200
TRAVIS: While we've been sitting down there, I
have not disguised the way I look. Any glances,

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.626
looks, anybody we recognize? Anybody lingering on
us?

01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:31.605
MATT: In the 15 or 20 minutes or so that Jester's
been gone, the rest of the room has filled. To the

01:32:31.605 --> 01:32:34.903
point where there are a few people hovering around
your tables in hopes that perhaps you will leave

01:32:34.903 --> 01:32:39.272
and they will try to snipe it from you,
occasionally clear their throat in your presence.

01:32:39.272 --> 01:32:41.458
Hoping that maybe you'll recognize their status as
higher.

01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:42.956
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we're here. We are here.

01:32:42.956 --> 01:32:46.563
MARISHA: I make myself look real big. Put my staff
out.

01:32:46.563 --> 01:32:49.208
TRAVIS: Feet up on the other chair?

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:51.260
MARISHA: Yeah, holding the chair for Jester.

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:53.803
TRAVIS: What? Move on, friend.

01:32:53.803 --> 01:32:56.893
MATT: They eventually make their way to the
opposite side of the room, perpetually throwing

01:32:56.893 --> 01:32:58.398
stink-eye in your direction.

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:00.018
LIAM: Are we in the front, or the middle, or the
back?

01:33:00.018 --> 01:33:03.854
MATT: You guys, I believe, took a table near the
stairs, which would be on the right side,

01:33:03.967 --> 01:33:09.397
probably, for a table that was available. Looking
from the entrance you came, so it would be on the

01:33:09.397 --> 01:33:10.895
northeastern side of the building.

01:33:10.895 --> 01:33:12.676
LIAM: Okay. How big an audience space is it?

01:33:12.676 --> 01:33:15.887
MATT: It's ten tables.

01:33:15.887 --> 01:33:18.510
LIAM: Roughly how many people are crammed in here,
at a guess?

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.336
MARISHA: Ten tables is a lot.

01:33:20.423 --> 01:33:24.469
MATT: Yeah, throughout the interior of this whole
chamber, you probably have, now including

01:33:24.469 --> 01:33:27.721
yourselves, close to 50 to 60 people.

01:33:27.721 --> 01:33:29.658
LIAM: Okay.

01:33:29.658 --> 01:33:39.317
MATT: That includes the people who are standing
because the tables have either been taken. Some of

01:33:39.317 --> 01:33:42.981
the tables here are set in reserve for people that
are only two folks that sit there and no one else

01:33:42.981 --> 01:33:45.955
is allowed to take the table and it is enforced.
They come with their own Zolezzo bodyguards.

01:33:45.955 --> 01:33:48.830
MARISHA: Are they there? The two people?

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:53.403
MATT: Yeah, there is a couple that is currently
situated on one of the central tables.

01:33:53.403 --> 01:33:55.151
MARISHA: What do they look like?

01:33:55.151 --> 01:34:01.784
MATT: The first one you see is a human woman,
probably in her early twenties or so, very vibrant

01:34:01.784 --> 01:34:08.004
blonde hair that is pulled back and left into
these curls that spiral down off the shoulders.

01:34:08.004 --> 01:34:19.139
Wearing a low-shoulder dress that's made of a very
fine-- you can't really make out the material, but

01:34:19.139 --> 01:34:29.233
it has a sheen to it. Beautiful jewelry. Across
the way, you can see a much older man. Receding

01:34:29.233 --> 01:34:38.254
hairline a bit, deep grayish turning white hair,
very deep set crows feet in the sides of his face

01:34:38.254 --> 01:34:42.445
where his eyes are almost not visible. The eyelids
themselves seem to be almost drooping and the

01:34:42.445 --> 01:34:49.173
wrinkles beneath are encroaching upon what little
of the eyes you can see. Probably in his seventies

01:34:49.173 --> 01:34:58.289
or so, very well dressed, with a coat and tails.
Both their attire seems to be more Dwendalian than

01:34:58.289 --> 01:35:06.368
Menagerie Coast. At least in the styles that they
are wearing, though they do have two Zolezzo that

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:08.862
are hired and keeping a watch at the table.

01:35:08.862 --> 01:35:14.420
MARISHA: Jester. You recognize those stuffy pants
people?

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:17.114
MATT: You do not.

01:35:17.114 --> 01:35:18.412
SAM: Good one.

01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:19.664
MARISHA: Thanks.

01:35:19.664 --> 01:35:25.248
LAURA: No, I've never seen them before. Have you
eaten any of this cheese? It's really good.

01:35:25.248 --> 01:35:28.989
SAM: No, but we got you two milks because there's
a two drink minimum.

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:31.555
LAURA: Oh! Thank you.

01:35:31.555 --> 01:35:38.165
MATT: Drinks have been ordered to your
specifications of the table, and the drinks here

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.121
are <i>expensive</i>.

01:35:40.121 --> 01:35:42.297
LIAM: I covered that.

01:35:42.297 --> 01:35:50.507
MATT: Okay. It's rare that you get rounds here;
you either get high end liquors or bottles of wine.

01:35:50.538 --> 01:35:52.283
MARISHA: Table service.

01:35:52.335 --> 01:35:55.037
LIAM: Whatever is expected here, Caleb covers.

01:35:55.037 --> 01:35:57.865
MATT: All right. That will cost you
approximately--

01:35:57.865 --> 01:35:59.436
MARISHA: One platinum.

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:04.205
MATT: Almost, six gold. For two bottles of wine.

01:36:04.205 --> 01:36:07.961
SAM: Wow, so generous, Caleb. Thank you.

01:36:07.961 --> 01:36:15.934
MATT: Actually no, I'm sorry. I read that wrong.
For the liquor, it would be six gold. For the two

01:36:15.934 --> 01:36:18.213
bottles of wine, it's ten gold apiece. So 26 gold
total.

01:36:18.213 --> 01:36:22.523
LAURA: I told you I was rich.

01:36:22.523 --> 01:36:27.148
SAM: Do you tip in the Menagerie Coast? Is there
tipping?

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.437
LAURA: Do you tip here?

01:36:28.437 --> 01:36:30.609
SAM: In the Menagerie Coast tipping, five percent?
Ten percent?

01:36:30.609 --> 01:36:31.952
MATT: I don't know, do you tip here?

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:35.302
TRAVIS: The whole fucking society is based off of
tipping.

01:36:35.308 --> 01:36:39.099
LIAM: But Caleb does not not know that and does
not tip. He has no experience with any of it.

01:36:39.099 --> 01:36:41.040
MARISHA: Just like a Zemnian.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:49.231
MATT: The doors are closed on the other side of
the chamber. The band brings their song to a

01:36:49.231 --> 01:36:56.728
close. A bit of a murmur takes the quiet room as
the lights shift. The candles that were all that

01:36:56.728 --> 01:37:03.870
warm, yellowish orange light, suddenly, all at
once, reduce to a low, red flicker.

01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:09.426
SAM: This is exciting. I should've peed before the
show started.

01:37:09.426 --> 01:37:11.978
LAURA: I never really get to watch from down
here.

01:37:11.978 --> 01:37:13.507
SAM: This is exciting.

01:37:13.507 --> 01:37:16.538
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a
break.

01:37:16.538 --> 01:37:18.247
(shouting)

01:37:18.247 --> 01:37:22.151
MARISHA: I'm so ready. I'm ready for it!

01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:26.175
SAM: (sings Get Ready 4 This)

01:37:26.175 --> 01:37:29.321
MARISHA: Y'all ready for this?

01:37:29.321 --> 01:37:31.409
LIAM: Now coming to the stage!

01:37:31.409 --> 01:37:35.949
MATT: We'll come back here in just a few minutes.
We're going to take a quick break, for us and for

01:37:35.949 --> 01:37:39.098
you folks. We're having our giveaway tonight, our
Wyrmwood giveaway!

01:37:39.098 --> 01:37:42.175
LIAM: Whip it out; how's it look?

01:37:42.175 --> 01:37:49.563
MATT: The fantastic dice tower set made from
cherry wood right here. We got the Raven's Call

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:56.593
cartography from our friend, Deven Rue. That's
some amazing work there. It is beautiful! It's the

01:37:56.593 --> 01:37:59.923
whole magnetic set where you can assemble your
dice tower, with a little dice box and that. In

01:37:59.923 --> 01:38:05.442
order to enter, you have to jump over to the
Critical Role Twitch, that's

01:38:05.442 --> 01:38:12.749
twitch.tv/criticalrole and in the chatroom enter
the code word "pets." P-E-T-S. One time only; more

01:38:12.749 --> 01:38:14.918
than once and you'll be disqualified.

01:38:14.918 --> 01:38:17.363
MARISHA: Didn't want to go with Professor
Thaddeus?

01:38:17.363 --> 01:38:24.678
MATT: Nah. Partially because I didn't know what it
was then. Enter the code there during the break

01:38:24.678 --> 01:38:29.120
and we'll come back here shortly with a winner.
We'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.509
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:38:30.594 --> 01:57:05.467
[break]

01:57:05.487 --> 01:57:13.667
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. We have our winner
of the fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway. The person who

01:57:13.687 --> 01:57:17.443
won is fourpony. Fourpony, congratulations.

01:57:17.548 --> 01:57:18.647
TRAVIS: Fourpony?

01:57:18.647 --> 01:57:21.552
MATT: Yeah, as in F-O-U-R-P-O-N-Y. Fourpony.

01:57:21.552 --> 01:57:27.308
SAM: You always want a little fore-pony before the
pony.

01:57:27.308 --> 01:57:33.381
MATT: Fore-pony is important. Congratulations,
fourpony. We'll get that information and get this

01:57:33.381 --> 01:57:42.993
sent out to you ASAP. Well done! Wanted to remind
you folks also as we are two minutes away from the

01:57:42.993 --> 01:57:54.042
drop of the Waterdeep: Dragon Heist adventure
being available within D&D Beyond. For those that

01:57:54.042 --> 01:57:58.257
aren't aware, not only is it a cool new adventure,
but a lot of great people got to work on it and I

01:57:58.257 --> 01:58:04.938
had the opportunity to consult on the Dragon
Heist, helping flesh out villains and factions and

01:58:04.938 --> 01:58:09.600
story elements there. It was a lot of fun to work
with the team. Super proud of it, there's some fun

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:16.024
bits in the book. I hope you guys'll enjoy. You
have, as of now, one minute! 60 seconds from being

01:58:16.024 --> 01:58:17.910
able to get it. So look for it ASAP.

01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:20.649
TRAVIS: (singing) D&D!

01:58:20.649 --> 01:58:26.464
SAM: Click on the site, cover your body in blood,
download it right away.

01:58:26.464 --> 01:58:28.356
MATT: The proper way to celebrate.

01:58:28.356 --> 01:58:30.444
TRAVIS: (singing) D&D Beyond!

01:58:30.444 --> 01:58:38.700
MATT: All right. As you've all been sitting in
your seats enjoying your small table snacks, the

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:44.715
chamber has closed, the lights have shifted, and
there is a bit of anticipation and tension in the

01:58:44.715 --> 01:58:53.794
room. As the musicians begin to slowly build up to
a new type of song that begins to fill the space,

01:58:53.794 --> 01:59:05.579
you hear the gentle footfall down the stairs,
curving down from the right hand side to the

01:59:05.579 --> 01:59:11.670
central staircase, the beautiful visage of the
Ruby of the Sea in her dark dress, the train

01:59:11.670 --> 01:59:19.043
dangling up about six or seven steps behind her as
her fingers trace the sides of the railing. She

01:59:19.043 --> 01:59:28.395
comes down, takes a breath, and begins to gently
sing to the audience around you and you watch as

01:59:28.395 --> 01:59:33.669
everyone in the room begins to lean forward,
entranced, the beautiful voice filling the

01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:40.225
interior of this inn. The lights seem to almost
flicker and shift with her emotional intent of the

01:59:40.225 --> 01:59:49.110
song. As her voice fills the space with warmth,
the light seems to brighten ever so gently with

01:59:49.110 --> 01:59:54.323
each crescendo. Even the bartenders themselves
have stopped. Though they've seen performances

01:59:54.323 --> 02:00:00.302
like this hundreds of times, it's still a
performance that draws attention from all across

02:00:00.302 --> 02:00:07.012
the coast and beyond. Jester, you've seen this
many times as well, but it doesn't ever lose its

02:00:07.012 --> 02:00:13.201
luster. You see as all the tables themselves are
quiet as she steps into the center of the room,

02:00:13.201 --> 02:00:18.517
walking from table to table, tracing the edges
with her fingers, making eye contact with each of

02:00:18.517 --> 02:00:24.569
the patrons. You see that older man and the
younger woman sitting at the table, both sit

02:00:24.569 --> 02:00:30.982
comfortably watching, but can't help but smile in
the presence of this fantastic vocalist. You see

02:00:30.982 --> 02:00:37.249
at another table there is a rather burly looking
man who is well dressed, though a bit rugged for

02:00:37.249 --> 02:00:43.503
what he's wearing, who is flanked by two dwarven
bodyguards, and he's leaning in real intent on the

02:00:43.503 --> 02:00:49.560
table towards her, and as she steps by, he touches
her hand, and she touches it and pulls away a bit,

02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.779
and gives him a wink and continues singing. He
pulls back into his chair, resting. You watch as

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:59.099
one of the other tables has these three merchants
that have been there since the moment you arrived,

02:00:59.099 --> 02:01:04.727
who seem to be eagerly counting out coins and
pushing them to the edge of the table to tip her.

02:01:04.727 --> 02:01:09.422
As she passes by, she glances off to one of the
assistants who rushes over and scoops them off the

02:01:09.422 --> 02:01:12.257
table. She does not accept the tips herself.

02:01:12.257 --> 02:01:13.457
MARISHA: Classy.

02:01:13.457 --> 02:01:18.707
(laughter)

02:01:18.707 --> 02:01:23.499
MATT: Nevertheless, for those of you who this is
your first time here within the Lavish Chateau,

02:01:23.499 --> 02:01:28.792
this is definitely one of the most beautiful
performance you've seen, and you immediately see

02:01:28.792 --> 02:01:33.394
why Jester's mother, why The Ruby of the Sea, or
at least one of the many reasons that she's

02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:42.362
renowned across these lands. As she completes the
piece, she ascends back up the stairs, back to her

02:01:42.362 --> 02:01:48.835
chambers, vanishing from sight. As everyone within
stands up, and begins clapping and cheering.

02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:51.665
SAM: Brava.

02:01:51.665 --> 02:01:56.321
LAURA: I see it. Yeah, nice.

02:01:56.321 --> 02:01:59.902
SAM: We'll put it in post.

02:01:59.902 --> 02:02:10.049
MATT: With that, the doors open to the backside of
the inn. Some folks begin to saunter out, their

02:02:10.049 --> 02:02:14.220
performance that they've come to see for the
evening complete. Others go back to their meal,

02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:22.879
and their drinks and their conversation. Some
individuals begin to approach the bartenders and

02:02:22.974 --> 02:02:28.940
eagerly ask for, what you know to be, the
availability for companionship that the Ruby has

02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.848
for the evening.

02:02:30.848 --> 02:02:32.742
LAURA: Good luck.

02:02:32.742 --> 02:02:35.598
MARISHA: Dude, Jester's mom has got it going on.

02:02:35.598 --> 02:02:40.637
TRAVIS: That was really... something.

02:02:40.637 --> 02:02:43.751
SAM: She was so good.

02:02:43.751 --> 02:02:45.169
LAURA: Isn't she wonderful?

02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:46.773
SAM: So much poise.

02:02:46.773 --> 02:02:49.637
LAURA: Turn your fucking thing away from me.
It's hurting my heart.

02:02:49.637 --> 02:02:51.970
TRAVIS: You can't even watch ASPCA commercials.

02:02:51.970 --> 02:02:54.183
LIAM: So I got to look at it?

02:02:54.183 --> 02:02:55.964
SAM: She was amazing.

02:02:55.964 --> 02:02:57.131
LAURA: I know!

02:02:57.131 --> 02:03:01.378
SAM: I mean, how much does she make for a
performance like that?

02:03:01.690 --> 02:03:04.302
LAURA: Oh, I don't know. We never counted it.

02:03:04.302 --> 02:03:09.621
MARISHA: Does she only work on tips, or does she
also get paid from the venue, or is that--

02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:13.046
LAURA: Well, I mean, she lives here.

02:03:13.046 --> 02:03:14.790
MARISHA: Oh right.

02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:21.542
LAURA: But she gets paid for other things, and the
tips from the singing. The singing pulls in the

02:03:21.542 --> 02:03:24.152
other things. You know what I mean.

02:03:24.152 --> 02:03:25.424
TALIESIN: No.

02:03:25.424 --> 02:03:32.350
TRAVIS: It was mesmerizing, Jester. I mean, she
really had an effect on the room. Was it just me,

02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:35.175
or did the lights seem to dance when she was
singing?

02:03:35.175 --> 02:03:37.207
LAURA: That's her Thaumaturgy.

02:03:37.207 --> 02:03:38.401
SAM: Oh!

02:03:38.401 --> 02:03:39.770
TRAVIS: You have that!

02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:41.390
LAURA: I do. I make the lights flare just a little
bit.

02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:45.927
MATT: You watch as the lights flicker and shift in
a similar way that they did with the performance.

02:03:45.927 --> 02:03:50.265
Some of the patrons stop and look towards the
stairs to see if she's coming back down again, and

02:03:50.265 --> 02:03:52.016
then (sigh).

02:03:52.016 --> 02:03:53.920
LAURA: Keep your pants on!

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.150
TRAVIS: Making them want an encore, huh.

02:03:56.150 --> 02:03:58.556
LAURA: Are you all in love with her now?

02:03:58.556 --> 02:04:02.530
SAM: She's a striking woman.

02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:03.841
TRAVIS: Stunning.

02:04:03.841 --> 02:04:05.117
TALIESIN: Very impressive.

02:04:05.117 --> 02:04:08.740
LIAM: Would she sing with you, when you're alone?

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:11.241
LAURA: Well yeah, she sang to me all the time.

02:04:11.241 --> 02:04:12.707
LIAM: Did you sing with her?

02:04:12.707 --> 02:04:16.291
LAURA: Sometimes. Mostly it was just her, though.

02:04:16.291 --> 02:04:19.411
TRAVIS: Do you ever wish you could do what she
does?

02:04:19.411 --> 02:04:26.605
LAURA: Be that pretty, and graceful, and sing
really good, and have a bunch of people think

02:04:26.605 --> 02:04:28.214
she's wonderful?

02:04:28.214 --> 02:04:29.281
SAM: Yeah.

02:04:29.281 --> 02:04:33.120
LAURA: No, of course not! I like myself just the
way I am.

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:38.274
MARISHA: I think you're pretty and graceful and
pretty graceful.

02:04:38.274 --> 02:04:40.156
LAURA: Thanks, Beau.

02:04:40.156 --> 02:04:41.358
TRAVIS: Your singing voice is nice.

02:04:41.358 --> 02:04:48.662
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord. When did you hear me sing?

02:04:48.662 --> 02:04:52.273
LIAM: When you first told us about your mother.

02:04:52.273 --> 02:04:57.470
LAURA: Oh, that's right. I did sing for you.
You're welcome.

02:04:57.470 --> 02:05:03.742
SAM: Hey look, we've made it through a whole
show with no frog people attacking us or anything.

02:05:03.742 --> 02:05:05.021
So that's good.

02:05:05.021 --> 02:05:07.161
LIAM: The night isn't over yet.

02:05:07.161 --> 02:05:09.543
SAM: That happened at the last show we went to.

02:05:09.766 --> 02:05:10.497
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:05:10.497 --> 02:05:12.069
LAURA: Yeah, big scary dude.

02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:13.862
TRAVIS: Oh that's right. Man, that was our
first--

02:05:13.862 --> 02:05:16.227
SAM: Show, first show.

02:05:16.227 --> 02:05:23.913
TRAVIS: Did you want to spend more time with your
mother? Did you--

02:05:23.913 --> 02:05:26.207
LIAM: I would assume so, yeah.

02:05:26.207 --> 02:05:32.589
LAURA: Well, of course. Usually, after the
performance is taken by other things.

02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:38.960
MATT: The heavy footfalls catch your ear as this
stomping sound start making their way down the

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.945
stairs. You watch as a male figure comes down in a
huff. One of the men that you saw watching the

02:05:45.945 --> 02:05:49.082
performance earlier, the more muscular fellow.
Getting a better look at him now, you can see he

02:05:49.082 --> 02:05:56.245
has a rough tangled, like a bowl cut, that is a
bit unkempt at the shoulders. A very wide neck,

02:05:56.245 --> 02:06:08.105
and once again, he's well dressed, but his
sun-weathered skin and lack of social grace and

02:06:08.105 --> 02:06:14.203
his physicality belies this weird space between
how he holds himself and how he dresses.

02:06:14.203 --> 02:06:21.576
Nevertheless, he storms down the stairs, his two
dwarven bodyguards leaving along with him. They

02:06:21.576 --> 02:06:23.173
end up exiting the inn.

02:06:23.173 --> 02:06:24.796
TRAVIS: He didn't look very happy.

02:06:24.796 --> 02:06:26.202
TALIESIN: No, he did not.

02:06:26.202 --> 02:06:30.574
LAURA: (singsong) He probably got turned away,
because my mom was already taken.

02:06:30.574 --> 02:06:38.928
SAM: How does she figure out who's going to be the
customer? Is it a lottery, or a wait list system?

02:06:38.928 --> 02:06:46.681
LAURA: It's kind of a wait list, but usually she
only has, you know, a few patrons during any given

02:06:46.681 --> 02:06:54.345
period of time. So she'll have the best diplomats
that come to town and if they've claimed that time

02:06:54.345 --> 02:07:00.941
then they can spend time with her for an entire
week or even more and nobody else will come to see

02:07:00.941 --> 02:07:02.613
her. You know what I mean?

02:07:02.613 --> 02:07:06.543
TRAVIS: Does she have to deal with a lot of
jealous suitors?

02:07:06.543 --> 02:07:13.159
LAURA: Sometimes. There's a lot of people that
want to marry her, and have tried to court her and

02:07:13.159 --> 02:07:17.815
stuff like that. But she only ever, you know, said
yes to my dad.

02:07:17.815 --> 02:07:19.380
SAM: Aw.

02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:23.490
TRAVIS: She's got lots of security, obviously.
This place seems, you know, pretty well--

02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:27.539
LAURA: Yeah, there's lot of security guards around
here, unfortunately.

02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:34.111
SAM: Well, should we leave her in peace? If she has
work to do, we should leave.

02:07:34.112 --> 02:07:40.091
LIAM: Is there a time of the day or the week that
you would have mother-daughter time?

02:07:40.181 --> 02:07:48.261
LAURA: It would usually-- you know, she'd come
tuck me into bed, late at night, afterwards.

02:07:48.261 --> 02:07:55.099
Sometimes I would already be asleep, but she'd
come in and say, "I'm just saying good night to

02:07:55.099 --> 02:08:00.655
"you, love." Then she would go, and then we'd wake
up, and sometimes we'd have breakfast, but

02:08:00.655 --> 02:08:06.451
sometimes we wouldn't and then sometimes she was
gone for a few days at a time because the people

02:08:06.451 --> 02:08:10.957
here, they don't really want to know about their
daughters or anything like that. So I would stay

02:08:10.957 --> 02:08:16.063
hidden, she would tell me to, and then sometimes
she'd be free and then we could have lunch or

02:08:16.063 --> 02:08:17.793
something.

02:08:17.793 --> 02:08:20.192
SAM: Sounds fine. Sounds normal.

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:25.271
TRAVIS: I think we'd all like to meet her. Would
tomorrow be the time for that?

02:08:25.271 --> 02:08:32.543
LAURA: I can send a message or-- tell you what.
I'm not going to waste a spell slot. I'm just

02:08:32.543 --> 02:08:38.726
going to run upstairs and tell Nadine to not
disturb my mom, but to ask if it's okay if I come

02:08:38.726 --> 02:08:40.541
by tomorrow, maybe.

02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:46.035
MATT: As Nadine opens the room, "Actually your
mother--" and opens the door and your mom, who has

02:08:46.035 --> 02:08:51.879
taken the dress off and has currently put on a
comfortable robe, turns and goes, "Jester, I have

02:08:51.879 --> 02:08:55.540
"taken no suitors this evening, so we can spend
it together."

02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:58.595
LAURA: What! Really?

02:08:58.595 --> 02:09:02.979
MATT: "You've said you wanted me to meet your
friends. I want to hear their stories and I need

02:09:02.979 --> 02:09:05.572
"to say thank you to those who've kept my little
girl safe."

02:09:05.572 --> 02:09:10.496
LAURA: Mama, that's so wonderful. I'll be right
back. Can they come upstairs?

02:09:10.496 --> 02:09:12.001
MATT: "Of course, of course."

02:09:12.001 --> 02:09:14.821
LAURA: Do you know if we can stay here tonight?

02:09:14.821 --> 02:09:22.543
MATT: "Well, you are welcome to stay in your room,
if you like. I can definitely have rooms arranged

02:09:22.543 --> 02:09:24.507
"for all of you, if you would prefer."

02:09:24.507 --> 02:09:26.381
LAURA: We'll see what they think.

02:09:26.381 --> 02:09:27.961
MATT: "Whatever you prefer, my dear."

02:09:27.961 --> 02:09:33.983
LAURA: I run downstairs. (shouting) You can talk
to her tonight! We can go back upstairs, come on.

02:09:33.983 --> 02:09:36.553
I turn back around and go running back upstairs.

02:09:36.553 --> 02:09:38.003
MATT: Okay.

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:40.190
MARISHA: Are we supposed to follow? Okay, we
follow.

02:09:40.190 --> 02:09:44.201
MATT: You guys head all upstairs, and eventually
make your way to the third landing and the

02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:50.662
chamber's open, and there Nadine's waiting and
escorts you in. Beautiful chambers, with a large

02:09:50.662 --> 02:09:58.067
canopy bed. You can see silks in the windows that
have elements of gems and beads knitted into these

02:09:58.067 --> 02:10:03.068
braided cords that you can imagine during the
daylight would add bits of colored speckles

02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:10.574
throughout the chamber. You see a balcony that
overlooks the entirety of the wharf below and also

02:10:10.574 --> 02:10:16.980
know this to be the balcony where Jester got in
trouble. But there you can see within this--

02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:20.426
TRAVIS: Marquis Demesne.

02:10:20.426 --> 02:10:21.850
MATT: Exactly.

02:10:21.889 --> 02:10:22.932
LIAM: It's "mar-quiz."

02:10:22.932 --> 02:10:24.107
TRAVIS: "Mar-quez."

02:10:24.342 --> 02:10:25.903
MARISHA: "Mar-quay-ee."

02:10:25.903 --> 02:10:35.721
MATT: I'm very confused by that exchange. But
chairs are being brought up, more food is being

02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:44.167
brought up behind you. Two more bottles of wine
have been fetched to your chamber, and there, robe

02:10:44.167 --> 02:10:50.230
placed on, most of the jewelry removed, but still
fully made up and smiling as you enter, you see

02:10:50.230 --> 02:10:59.639
the beautiful, red-skinned, Ruby of the Sea. Her
dark hair now tied up behind and resting down the

02:10:59.639 --> 02:11:02.715
back of her robe, with a single curl that runs
in front of the face on the right side.

02:11:03.315 --> 02:11:15.198
Faintly white, yellow gold eyes. The horns that
curl backwards and then shift off to the sides

02:11:15.198 --> 02:11:19.496
abruptly before curving back a little bit. It's
this beautiful curl that extenuates the way her

02:11:19.496 --> 02:11:25.201
hair falls behind. It gives this wreath and a
crowned look to her. This regal presentation even

02:11:25.201 --> 02:11:33.918
when she's just wearing comfortable robes. As you
all enter one by one, she goes, "Please, know that

02:11:33.918 --> 02:11:39.740
"you are guests of me here within this. Call this
your home for as long as you'd like to stay."

02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:42.638
LAURA: We could stay here forever if we wanted
to.

02:11:42.638 --> 02:11:46.059
SAM: I don't think that's what she means.

02:11:46.059 --> 02:11:52.015
MATT: "Well, you would have to eventually pay, but
you are welcome to stay for a while under my name.

02:11:52.015 --> 02:11:55.800
"Please, I would like to the know the names. If you
would like to introduce?"

02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:01.410
LAURA: This is Fjord. I meet him earliest. He's a
half-orc and he's growing his teeth back and

02:12:01.410 --> 02:12:03.955
he's very handsome.

02:12:03.955 --> 02:12:05.670
MATT: "I can see that."

02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:08.295
TRAVIS: It's a pleasure. I can see where Jester
gets her good looks from.

02:12:08.295 --> 02:12:13.953
MATT: "Well, I can see where she speaks honestly in
front of her mother as well." She puts her hand out.

02:12:13.953 --> 02:12:15.706
TRAVIS: I'll give it a kiss.

02:12:15.706 --> 02:12:23.863
MATT: She pulls away, but rests just a moment on
your finger tips before pulling away and smiles.

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:34.021
"I can see you are a very strong-willed and
protective man. Do you watch over Jester

02:12:34.053 --> 02:12:35.002
"in my stead?"

02:12:35.002 --> 02:12:36.754
TRAVIS: I do. I try to.

02:12:36.754 --> 02:12:46.106
MATT: "Good. I feel better knowing that she's safe
in your care. Anyway."

02:12:46.446 --> 02:12:49.703
LAURA: This is Beau. She's really strong. She's
the one I was telling you about that can fight

02:12:49.703 --> 02:12:51.178
things with a stick.

02:12:51.178 --> 02:12:54.056
MATT: "Right. You mentioned that earlier. Beau, it
is a pleasure."

02:12:54.056 --> 02:12:55.799
MARISHA: What's up?

02:12:55.799 --> 02:12:57.912
MATT: She reaches and shakes your hand.

02:12:57.912 --> 02:13:05.046
MARISHA: I also kiss her hand. Do the finger tip
thing back.

02:13:05.046 --> 02:13:10.459
MATT: "The pleasure is mine as well."

02:13:10.459 --> 02:13:14.781
MARISHA: Ah, Caleb.

02:13:14.781 --> 02:13:21.770
LAURA: This is Caleb. He's a wizard. He has a lot
of fire and stuff. He likes his books and he used

02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:24.756
to smell bad, but he doesn't anymore. He likes
water now.

02:13:24.756 --> 02:13:32.427
LIAM: You have a beautiful singing voice. Thank
you very much for the performance. You have a

02:13:32.427 --> 02:13:34.028
very charming daughter.

02:13:34.028 --> 02:13:43.653
MATT: "Thank you, and thank you. You, I can sense,
a bit rough in the social graces, so I am very

02:13:43.653 --> 02:13:49.162
"honored that you would come to see my performance.
Is that a Zemnian accent?"

02:13:49.162 --> 02:13:51.470
LIAM: I am afraid so, <i>ja</i>.

02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:59.466
MATT: "It shows that you've traveled some distance
to be here. I appreciate that."

02:13:59.466 --> 02:14:01.553
LIAM: Fish out of water, yeah.

02:14:01.553 --> 02:14:05.835
MATT: "Well, you've found plenty of it here. So
perhaps the fish has found a home."

02:14:05.835 --> 02:14:09.390
TRAVIS: She's good. She's very good.

02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:15.959
LAURA: This is Nott. She's very very brave, even
though she's very small. Be careful of your rings.

02:14:15.959 --> 02:14:22.598
SAM: I wouldn't steal from your mother, and if I
did, we would solve the crime.

02:14:22.598 --> 02:14:26.097
LAURA: That's right! Because we are detectives
and we're really good at solving cases. She's

02:14:26.097 --> 02:14:27.865
my partner in crime.

02:14:27.865 --> 02:14:35.825
MATT: "Well, I was not aware this was the dress of
a detective."

02:14:35.825 --> 02:14:38.078
SAM: Oh. Am I still in my--

02:14:38.078 --> 02:14:39.217
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:14:39.217 --> 02:14:42.496
SAM: I will drop my form.

02:14:42.496 --> 02:14:44.498
LAURA: (whispers) This is what she really looks
like.

02:14:44.498 --> 02:14:47.004
MATT: Takes a step back. "Oh!"

02:14:47.004 --> 02:14:48.548
SAM: I'm sorry.

02:14:48.548 --> 02:14:49.972
MATT: "Don't apologize."

02:14:49.972 --> 02:14:54.261
TRAVIS: Always with the teeth.

02:14:54.261 --> 02:14:55.779
MARISHA: Love his hands.

02:14:55.779 --> 02:15:01.531
SAM: This is seagull blood, this is not human
blood.

02:15:01.531 --> 02:15:03.623
MATT: "The world is made of all kinds."

02:15:03.623 --> 02:15:09.090
SAM: If you need an extra seagull or two, I have
seven to spare and I would happily leave you one

02:15:09.090 --> 02:15:10.998
or two of those.

02:15:10.998 --> 02:15:14.780
MATT: "They are the rats of the city. I have had
plenty, but I thank you."

02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.277
SAM: They sure are.

02:15:16.277 --> 02:15:22.011
MATT: "Well, I think you are very adorable. It is
a pleasure to meet you, Nott."

02:15:22.011 --> 02:15:23.440
LAURA: See? You are adorable.

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.847
SAM: Well, she's very nice. It's lovely to meet
you. I'll curtsy.

02:15:29.857 --> 02:15:33.741
MATT: She grabs the edges of her robe and
counter-curtsies halfway, while she's sitting in her

02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:36.461
chair. "And this one, this--"

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:37.950
LAURA: And this is Caduceus.

02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:39.470
TALIESIN: Yeah, I pop back up.

02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:42.905
LAURA: He's got pink hair! He used to live in a
cemetery. He doesn't know a lot of things.

02:15:42.905 --> 02:15:46.763
(whispering) He doesn't know anything about sex.
(louder) And he drinks dead people tea.

02:15:46.763 --> 02:15:50.282
MATT: "Interesting."

02:15:50.282 --> 02:15:56.128
TALIESIN: Less of a cemetery, more of a graveyard.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

02:15:56.128 --> 02:16:02.839
MATT: "The pleasure is mine. You've not been outside
of this graveyard that my daughter speaks of?"

02:16:02.839 --> 02:16:05.224
TALIESIN: Only recently, yeah.

02:16:05.224 --> 02:16:09.124
MATT: "A man fresh to the world of vice, I
presume?"

02:16:09.124 --> 02:16:14.044
TALIESIN: Aware of it, but just trying to only dip
a couple toes in.

02:16:14.044 --> 02:16:20.968
MATT: "Oh, my daughter will break you of any
habits of ignorance very quickly."

02:16:20.968 --> 02:16:22.620
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:23.884
MATT: "Good."

02:16:23.884 --> 02:16:25.572
MARISHA: I would like to know what that means?

02:16:25.572 --> 02:16:30.256
MATT: "You carry very interesting companions."

02:16:30.256 --> 02:16:37.807
LAURA: I know! They've saved my life, you know.
And I've saved theirs because I'm a really good

02:16:37.807 --> 02:16:40.528
cleric. Did you know that I do that now?

02:16:40.528 --> 02:16:42.063
MATT: "I did not!"

02:16:42.063 --> 02:16:44.411
LAURA: I can heal people, Mom!

02:16:44.411 --> 02:16:45.852
MATT: "That is incredible!"

02:16:45.852 --> 02:16:53.000
SAM: She <i>can</i> heal people. She is able to.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.516
TRAVIS: She's been very helpful in a few frays. We
owe her quite a bit.

02:16:57.516 --> 02:17:07.782
MATT: "Well, I am grateful that you all have kept
her safe. I'm excited to hear that you've been

02:17:07.782 --> 02:17:18.850
"able to do such incredible things! Is this your
friend that you mentioned before? The Traveler?"

02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:22.187
LAURA: Oh, no he's not here.

02:17:22.187 --> 02:17:24.565
MATT: "No, but the healing."

02:17:24.565 --> 02:17:26.674
LAURA: The healing? Yeah!

02:17:26.674 --> 02:17:32.436
MATT: "Wow! Oh, very well! Well, that is
incredible."

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:34.117
LAURA: I know, yeah!

02:17:34.117 --> 02:17:42.353
MATT: "Well, I-- Here, let's have some drinks."
The servants begin to uncork the wine and--

02:17:42.353 --> 02:17:45.419
SAM: What do you prefer to drink?

02:17:45.419 --> 02:17:51.202
MATT: "To be honest? That one." She points to one
of the two bottles that were brought up. As

02:17:51.202 --> 02:17:59.071
opposed to the smooth wine bottle, this has a
faceted gem-type crystal design to it. The cork

02:17:59.071 --> 02:18:04.476
itself has a deep crimson ribbon that's tied around
it. There's a little wax seal placed upon it.

02:18:04.476 --> 02:18:07.389
LAURA: Oh hold on, let me go get the aerator.

02:18:07.389 --> 02:18:11.194
SAM: Oh, what's that?

02:18:11.194 --> 02:18:13.531
MATT: "It's a cantrip."

02:18:13.531 --> 02:18:17.476
(laughter)

02:18:17.476 --> 02:18:27.286
MATT: (aerating sound) You begin to tell her tales
of the adventures you've had and recount how

02:18:27.286 --> 02:18:34.995
you've met, and you talk for a number of hours or
so. She's smiling and listening and engaging.

02:18:34.995 --> 02:18:44.310
While she's this beautiful, matronly woman, there
are moments when you can see that warmth and pride

02:18:44.310 --> 02:18:50.722
creep through when she looks at Jester. You can
also see that there is a very reserved and

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:56.979
controlled wisdom and intelligence to her. She's a
very perceptive woman that asks the right

02:18:56.979 --> 02:19:00.605
questions at the right moments to throw you
off-guard a bit, and also get a bit of honesty.

02:19:00.605 --> 02:19:08.370
You begin to see how the quality of her
companionship comes from her insightfulness and

02:19:08.370 --> 02:19:15.475
ability to bring comfort to any conversation.
Though you had all these expectations, and you

02:19:15.475 --> 02:19:23.897
have your guard built up, you can't help but
strangely feel welcome and open with a person that

02:19:23.897 --> 02:19:30.158
you've just met. You take a moment to think on
that and see: this is really an incredible woman.

02:19:30.158 --> 02:19:38.755
"But you've all said so much about yourselves. I
am afraid there has not been too much happening

02:19:38.755 --> 02:19:47.709
"here that is different. Performances are great.
There is two new songs that I have requested

02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:50.917
"written that should be completed by the end of the
year."

02:19:50.917 --> 02:19:53.642
LAURA: (gasps) I can't wait to hear them!

02:19:53.642 --> 02:19:55.617
MATT: "I can't wait to perform them for you."

02:19:55.617 --> 02:20:01.927
LAURA: What happened with Lord Sharp? Did he
cause too much of a stink?

02:20:01.927 --> 02:20:12.645
MATT: "Not with me. He knows better than to go
after a well-connected and mostly innocent figure.

02:20:12.645 --> 02:20:23.919
"I have been working to try and get those charges
eliminated, but it is a difficult process. He is a

02:20:23.919 --> 02:20:36.230
"man who-- his pride is very important to him. So
in time. But for now, perhaps just do more of what

02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:40.263
"you've been doing to not look like yourself once
you leave this space."

02:20:40.263 --> 02:20:41.533
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:41.533 --> 02:20:45.464
SAM: Hypothetically, if he were to pass away,
would the trial charges disappear with him?

02:20:45.464 --> 02:20:54.677
MATT: (laughs) "I mean, yes. But I would not
insinuate such a dark thing."

02:20:54.677 --> 02:20:56.193
SAM: No, no.

02:20:56.193 --> 02:20:58.586
TRAVIS: Nott, remember what we talked about?
Criminal penalties--

02:20:58.586 --> 02:20:59.741
SAM: That's murder.

02:20:59.741 --> 02:21:02.919
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's one. A1. Bingo.

02:21:02.919 --> 02:21:04.408
SAM: That's on scale. All right.

02:21:04.408 --> 02:21:06.960
LAURA: We do really good things most of the time,
though.

02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:13.271
MATT: "Well, what has brought you here? I mean,
I'm happy to have you, but if you are just here to

02:21:13.271 --> 02:21:14.810
"see me perform, then I--"

02:21:14.810 --> 02:21:17.370
LAURA: We should show her the letter.

02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:20.136
SAM: Oh, yes! We're solving a mystery.

02:21:20.136 --> 02:21:22.737
LAURA: Yeah, like remember we told you we were
detectives.

02:21:22.737 --> 02:21:24.165
MATT: "Right."

02:21:24.165 --> 02:21:29.635
SAM: We're also here for some other Fjord things,
but-- He has the letter. We're trying to figure

02:21:29.635 --> 02:21:38.310
out the provenance of this-- that's a detective
word-- of this letter, and who wrote it, and who

02:21:38.310 --> 02:21:39.935
is it for and stuff. What's that?

02:21:39.935 --> 02:21:45.119
TRAVIS: Indeed. Would you mind if I asked your mom
a few?

02:21:45.119 --> 02:21:46.910
LAURA: Oh, not at all. Go for it!

02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:51.543
TRAVIS: Just because you're so well-established in
this region, so well-known and connected as you

02:21:51.642 --> 02:21:57.585
mentioned, does the name Marius LePual ring any
bells?

02:21:57.809 --> 02:22:05.994
MATT: "Not directly, but I may be able to ask
around."

02:22:05.994 --> 02:22:09.258
TRAVIS: Well, if it wouldn't be too much of an
inconvenience.

02:22:09.258 --> 02:22:19.947
MATT: "I would, perhaps--" She hands it back to
you.

02:22:19.947 --> 02:22:23.190
SAM: Does that letter say Evantica on it, also?

02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:24.712
LAURA: Yeah, it says Evantica.

02:22:24.712 --> 02:22:26.274
SAM: Does that name mean anything to you?

02:22:26.274 --> 02:22:29.875
MATT: "Unfortunately no, I have not come across an
Evantica."

02:22:29.875 --> 02:22:32.165
SAM: How about The Captain?

02:22:32.165 --> 02:22:39.099
MATT: "There are many captains here in the port. I
apologize, but I know many."

02:22:39.099 --> 02:22:44.850
TRAVIS: Ionos is another name mentioned in the
letter.

02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:48.930
MARISHA: Ionos is the time of year? No.

02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:51.542
TRAVIS: No. It's "many thanks to you." I think
it's an I.

02:22:51.542 --> 02:22:52.954
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

02:22:52.954 --> 02:23:01.210
MATT: "I don't know an Ionos, either." You do
recall that Ionos is a member of the Jagentoth

02:23:01.210 --> 02:23:03.593
family, up in Shadycreek Run.

02:23:03.593 --> 02:23:04.888
MARISHA and SAM: That's right.

02:23:04.888 --> 02:23:06.990
MATT: Yeah, that was the connection with who that
letter was intended towards.

02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:08.380
MARISHA: To the Iron Shepherds. Right, okay.

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:12.970
SAM: Another dead end.

02:23:12.970 --> 02:23:15.010
LAURA: We'll figure it out.

02:23:15.010 --> 02:23:18.349
MATT: "But continue to ask. This is a vibrant
city, and there are many people that come and go.

02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:24.970
"Perhaps you could find somebody to help you
out there. I will continue to ask around. I'm

02:23:24.970 --> 02:23:28.405
"being careful with my socialization these days."

02:23:28.405 --> 02:23:31.100
TRAVIS: Please, we don't want to get you in any
sort of trouble--

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.265
MATT: "Well, It's no trouble, I just--"

02:23:33.265 --> 02:23:36.102
LAURA: Socialization? Why, Mama?

02:23:36.102 --> 02:23:45.821
MATT: "I've been having some problems with a
client."

02:23:45.821 --> 02:23:48.543
LAURA: What are you talking about?!

02:23:48.543 --> 02:23:56.098
MATT: "It's fine. He's a very intense man who
relocated here from Fionen about two months ago.

02:23:56.098 --> 02:24:00.231
"A burly fellow named Algar Dyomin."

02:24:00.231 --> 02:24:01.914
TALIESIN: Funny hair?

02:24:01.914 --> 02:24:08.376
MATT: "Yes. Kind of strange, interesting taste in
presentation."

02:24:08.376 --> 02:24:10.838
LAURA: Was he the guy that was here tonight?

02:24:10.838 --> 02:24:12.150
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of buff.

02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:14.459
MATT: "That is him, yes. He is very--"

02:24:14.459 --> 02:24:16.319
LIAM: What was that last name, again?

02:24:16.349 --> 02:24:28.289
MATT: Dyomin. D-Y-O-M-I-N. (sighs) "He's
become very possessive. He has been a client of

02:24:28.331 --> 02:24:35.492
"mine a number of times. And while his conversation
was on the duller scale of individuals I've been

02:24:35.751 --> 02:24:43.327
"with, he paid well and did not seem to bring a
problem. But he has become more and more

02:24:43.327 --> 02:24:50.015
"possessive, and only in this past week, I've been
hearing of him threatening and telling other clients

02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:59.624
"of mine to back away. I do not enjoy people
threatening my clientele or my business. I have

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:05.707
"twice now explained to him precisely the nature of
our arrangement and relationship. That does not

02:25:05.707 --> 02:25:13.203
"seem to be enough for him. Now, the zolezzo of the
chateau are my guardians, and they're very good

02:25:13.203 --> 02:25:21.767
"about keeping watch. I have my friends in the
Archways, but the more I look into it, I believe

02:25:21.767 --> 02:25:27.909
"Algar works directly for the Concord within the city,
so he is with his own powerful allies as well."

02:25:27.909 --> 02:25:30.107
SAM: The Concord?

02:25:30.107 --> 02:25:32.321
MARISHA, TRAVIS, and LIAM: The Clovis Concord.

02:25:32.321 --> 02:25:38.237
MATT: "This is my first time dealing with
scenarios like this, but I'd prefer to avoid any

02:25:38.237 --> 02:25:45.233
"sort of direct confrontation, by any means
necessary, any bloodshed within the Chateau." (sighs)

02:25:45.233 --> 02:25:51.433
LAURA: We lure him outside of the Chateau, and
then we kill him.

02:25:51.433 --> 02:25:55.053
MATT: (laughs)

02:25:55.053 --> 02:25:57.849
LAURA: I don't want him to hurt you, Mom.

02:25:57.849 --> 02:26:06.864
SAM: If you're trying to break up with him, you
could tell him that you have the creepies, the

02:26:06.864 --> 02:26:11.553
crawlies down there, and that might scare him
away?

02:26:11.553 --> 02:26:17.189
MATT: "I appreciate your cleverness, little Nott.
However, rumors travel quickly?"

02:26:17.189 --> 02:26:20.276
SAM: Oh, that would ruin you for the other
clients, too.

02:26:20.276 --> 02:26:21.783
MATT: "For some of them, perhaps."

02:26:21.783 --> 02:26:23.258
SAM: Smart.

02:26:23.258 --> 02:26:26.806
LIAM: You are unable to speak to the law here?

02:26:26.806 --> 02:26:35.864
MATT: "He has not broken the law. His friends
in some places enforce the law. That is where

02:26:35.864 --> 02:26:37.565
"my conundrum lies."

02:26:37.565 --> 02:26:42.603
MARISHA: What exactly does he do for the Clovis
Conclave? Concord?

02:26:42.603 --> 02:26:45.843
MATT: "Honestly, I'm not certain what kind of work
he does, though he often brags about his

02:26:45.843 --> 02:26:51.753
"importance, as men are wont to do. He does seem
rather wealthy, and he bears enough respect.

02:26:51.753 --> 02:26:55.350
"Perhaps the Wharfmaster may know more."

02:26:55.350 --> 02:26:58.968
LAURA: Maybe we can get him to fall in love with
someone else.

02:26:58.968 --> 02:27:03.620
MATT: "That would be helpful. Though, I don't mean
to brag, but good luck."

02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:08.039
MARISHA: We could just kick his ass, intimidate
the shit out of him. Tell him he's not to fuck

02:27:08.039 --> 02:27:09.452
with you anymore.

02:27:09.452 --> 02:27:11.308
LAURA: Yeah, but that links it back to her.

02:27:11.308 --> 02:27:14.080
MATT: "Be careful how you dance around that."

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:17.213
TRAVIS: Oh, sure, discretion is appreciated.

02:27:17.213 --> 02:27:24.161
MATT: "Very much. The old woman of the lighthouse
has been here for some time. Could ask her, perhaps."

02:27:24.161 --> 02:27:25.997
TRAVIS: The who?

02:27:25.997 --> 02:27:27.924
SAM and MARISHA: The old woman in the lighthouse?

02:27:27.924 --> 02:27:29.143
MATT: "Yes."

02:27:29.143 --> 02:27:30.845
SAM: Someone lives up there?

02:27:30.845 --> 02:27:32.695
MATT: "Yes, the keeper of it. The Lightkeeper."

02:27:32.695 --> 02:27:34.458
TALIESIN: Does she have a name?

02:27:34.458 --> 02:27:36.619
MATT: "Gladys, I think?"

02:27:36.619 --> 02:27:41.128
TRAVIS: I don't mean to pry into your business too
much, but are your appointments exclusively here,

02:27:41.128 --> 02:27:43.169
or have you ventured to his place?

02:27:43.169 --> 02:27:49.661
MATT: "No, they only meet here. It needs to be on
my terms, it needs to be in my realm of safety."

02:27:49.661 --> 02:27:56.442
TRAVIS: Understood. Do you know where we might be
able to find him? Does he say where he stays?

02:27:56.442 --> 02:28:05.505
MATT: "No. He's also been braggadocious, but not
forthcoming with personal information either,

02:28:05.505 --> 02:28:14.407
"which is unfortunately, a sign of, perhaps,
dubious and/or dangerous business? He's told me

02:28:14.407 --> 02:28:19.527
"twice he wishes to one day show me his secret, his
great servant beneath the city, but--"

02:28:19.527 --> 02:28:20.952
MARISHA: What?

02:28:20.952 --> 02:28:23.489
LAURA: His great servant beneath the city?

02:28:23.489 --> 02:28:36.277
TRAVIS: (sirens) Understood. I'm sure with a
personality as large as his, it won't be too hard

02:28:36.277 --> 02:28:39.269
to find some information on him, some gentle
poking around.

02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:48.657
LIAM: Just speaking hypothetically, it would not
upset you any if he were to disappear?

02:28:48.657 --> 02:28:50.278
MARISHA: Accidentally?

02:28:50.278 --> 02:28:52.967
LIAM: Not be around?

02:28:52.967 --> 02:29:03.344
MATT: "I don't believe he's done anything that would
warrant anything too disastrous, but if he can be

02:29:03.344 --> 02:29:12.053
"ensured that his presence is not welcome and
agrees that is the case, that would be optimal."

02:29:12.053 --> 02:29:18.234
LIAM: Well, we will try our best to reach the
optimum result.

02:29:18.234 --> 02:29:29.769
MARISHA: Do you know if there's a place where the
lowlifes of the city like to congregate? The underground?

02:29:29.769 --> 02:29:43.036
MATT: "There are many. There is The Skew, which
is where most of the riffraff and common folk live,

02:29:43.036 --> 02:29:51.563
"but if you're looking for more social environs, all
across the Restless Wharf. There is the Open Quay.

02:29:51.563 --> 02:30:05.196
"Those two places, a lot of curious folk wander
and celebrate. Fisticuff. It is not uncommon

02:30:05.239 --> 02:30:07.503
"to find bodies in alleys."

02:30:07.503 --> 02:30:10.537
MARISHA: I love celebrating fisticuffs.

02:30:10.537 --> 02:30:13.237
TRAVIS: That you do.

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:19.133
LAURA: What was his last name?

02:30:19.133 --> 02:30:21.254
LIAM: Dyomin.

02:30:21.254 --> 02:30:23.470
MARISHA: Algard, right?

02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:26.140
MATT: Dyomin. Algar. A-L-G-A-R.

02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:34.173
TRAVIS: Jester, I have to say, I don't feel any
great rush to continue on out of the city until

02:30:34.173 --> 02:30:38.128
you at least feel that your mother is safe and
protected.

02:30:38.128 --> 02:30:39.911
LAURA: Really? You guys will stay here?

02:30:39.911 --> 02:30:44.330
MATT: "Please, I do not mean to impose my
responsib--"

02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:47.262
LAURA: Mama! They're going to take care of you!

02:30:47.262 --> 02:30:52.733
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, you did take care of us in
those early days, even if you didn't know it.

02:30:52.733 --> 02:30:55.552
Jester picked up the bill a lot.

02:30:55.552 --> 02:31:00.350
LAURA: That's why I ran out of money. Thank you
for sending that package, by the way.

02:31:00.350 --> 02:31:03.681
MATT: "Of course. I'm sorry it took a little
longer than anticipated."

02:31:03.681 --> 02:31:05.537
LAURA: No, no, no. It's fine!

02:31:05.537 --> 02:31:15.875
TALIESIN: You mentioned the lighthouse. Would we
need anything to enter the lighthouse? Some token

02:31:15.875 --> 02:31:22.821
of familiarity, or some name that would get us a
tour to meet the proper people there?

02:31:22.821 --> 02:31:29.962
MATT: "As far as I know, there is but one person there.
I have not met them directly, only heard of them."

02:31:29.962 --> 02:31:32.439
TALIESIN: Gale?

02:31:32.439 --> 02:31:34.188
SAM and MATT: Gladys.

02:31:34.188 --> 02:31:42.978
MATT: "She's the Lightkeeper of the lighthouse. I
know that she can be rather ornery, so perhaps you

02:31:42.978 --> 02:31:45.186
"need to win over her interest?"

02:31:45.186 --> 02:31:47.004
TALIESIN: All right.

02:31:47.004 --> 02:31:53.382
MATT: "She is a bit older in human years, so be
respectful, I guess."

02:31:53.382 --> 02:32:02.246
LIAM: What are these interests you are referring to?
Her interests, you said to our friend Mr. Clay here.

02:32:02.246 --> 02:32:05.418
MATT: "I don't know. I don't know what her
interests are, but perhaps if you could find out,

02:32:05.418 --> 02:32:09.032
"or at least not make her extremely angry."

02:32:09.032 --> 02:32:12.556
LIAM: Well, it is good that we have the world's
two best detectives with us. That should be an

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:14.961
easy task to fulfill.

02:32:14.982 --> 02:32:17.396
SAM: Us.

02:32:17.396 --> 02:32:18.448
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

02:32:18.448 --> 02:32:20.399
SAM: You haven't seen us solve a crime yet, but--

02:32:20.399 --> 02:32:22.264
LAURA: We do a really good job.

02:32:22.264 --> 02:32:23.073
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:32:23.073 --> 02:32:30.255
TRAVIS: Jester looks extremely motivated. Perhaps
we taking care of this simple errand for you might

02:32:30.485 --> 02:32:33.001
help compensate for a few nights stay?

02:32:33.001 --> 02:32:39.459
MATT: "I do not require compensation, but if it
makes you feel better about it, certainly. You're

02:32:39.459 --> 02:32:42.004
"quite the gentleman."

02:32:42.032 --> 02:32:47.703
MARISHA: He's actually not The Gentleman. We met a
guy who goes by the name "Gentleman."

02:32:47.703 --> 02:32:49.654
LAURA: Have you heard of him, Mama?

02:32:49.654 --> 02:32:53.253
MARISHA: Oh, she's like-- oh okay, got it. I don't
know who knows who.

02:32:53.253 --> 02:32:58.926
LAURA: He's blue as well, and he's always sweaty.
Dark hair.

02:32:58.926 --> 02:33:00.753
SAM: He's wet.

02:33:00.753 --> 02:33:03.112
LAURA: Yeah. He's always really wet.

02:33:03.112 --> 02:33:04.560
SAM: He's a wet walker.

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:05.813
MARISHA: A wet walker!

02:33:05.899 --> 02:33:07.348
MATT: "Yes, I know of him."

02:33:07.348 --> 02:33:11.543
SAM: You know of The Gentleman? Is that a
good thing or a bad thing, because we're not

02:33:11.543 --> 02:33:14.101
cool with him so much.

02:33:14.101 --> 02:33:22.325
MATT: "Well, I know of a man of you describe, of
blueish skin and quite sweaty. Yes, he has come

02:33:22.325 --> 02:33:23.707
"through before."

02:33:23.707 --> 02:33:26.552
LAURA: Was he nice, or was he not nice?

02:33:26.552 --> 02:33:31.649
MATT: "He was very nice. He was very dashing."

02:33:31.649 --> 02:33:34.522
LAURA: Yeah?

02:33:34.522 --> 02:33:37.489
MATT: "I told you about him before."

02:33:37.489 --> 02:33:39.548
SAM and MARISHA: What?!

02:33:39.548 --> 02:33:44.722
LAURA: Wait a minute. But not <i>The Gentleman</i>,
though.

02:33:44.722 --> 02:33:48.876
MATT: "I don't know of the name 'The Gentleman,'
but--"

02:33:48.876 --> 02:33:54.776
LAURA: He has dark hair. He's got black hair
that's really long.

02:33:54.776 --> 02:33:56.277
MARISHA: And blue skin.

02:33:56.277 --> 02:34:02.578
TALIESIN: Oh my god, your mother knows The
Gentleman. That's so cool.

02:34:02.578 --> 02:34:09.011
SAM: It goes a little deeper than that, Deucy. Is
that--?

02:34:09.011 --> 02:34:11.346
MARISHA: What's happening?!

02:34:11.346 --> 02:34:16.638
SAM: That's why you always have a little sweat
right there.

02:34:16.865 --> 02:34:20.329
LAURA: No!

02:34:20.329 --> 02:34:28.710
MARISHA: This is why you can do watery stuff,
right? Like cold stuff? Can you do that?

02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:32.487
MATT: "Tell me more of this Gentleman, please."

02:34:32.487 --> 02:34:38.592
LAURA: Oh my gosh, okay. Well, he lives in Zadash,
and he lives in a bar, and he's got long black

02:34:38.592 --> 02:34:47.066
hair, and he's really charming, but kind of snarky
at the same time.

02:34:47.066 --> 02:34:52.622
MATT: "Well dressed, smooth voice, little patch of
dark hair on the chest right there?"

02:34:52.622 --> 02:34:55.629
MARISHA: The Leaky Nip.

02:34:55.629 --> 02:34:56.876
TRAVIS: Leaky Tap.

02:34:56.876 --> 02:34:57.907
MARISHA: Leaky Tap! Not the Leaky Nip.

02:34:57.907 --> 02:35:00.961
LAURA: He wasn't in the Leaky Tap!

02:35:00.961 --> 02:35:02.926
MATT: That's a very different place.

02:35:02.926 --> 02:35:06.091
MARISHA: I have it in the other book!

02:35:06.091 --> 02:35:08.746
SAM: The Evening Nip.

02:35:08.746 --> 02:35:10.322
LAURA: No, no!

02:35:10.322 --> 02:35:12.479
SAM: That's the Gentleman. The Evening Nip!

02:35:12.479 --> 02:35:14.567
MATT: Yes, The Evening Nip is the name of that
one.

02:35:14.567 --> 02:35:16.070
MARISHA: Okay, we're fighting over taverns.

02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:18.208
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we're freaking out! Keep it
together!

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:21.706
LAURA: We have a gift for him or something? We
have many gifts or something?

02:35:21.706 --> 02:35:25.007
MARISHA: We have nothing to offer, but we can
provide many gifts.

02:35:25.007 --> 02:35:35.613
SAM: He has a barkeep man named Clive Binz. He
knows a guy around here, too, named Father Pierce.

02:35:35.613 --> 02:35:44.782
MATT: "I don't know about anything in that regard,
but he wasn't named The Gentleman when I met him."

02:35:44.782 --> 02:35:48.736
TRAVIS: What was he named?

02:35:48.736 --> 02:35:50.147
LAURA: I never asked.

02:35:50.147 --> 02:35:57.069
SAM: I have a vial of his spit. Can you analyze
it? I don't know!

02:35:57.069 --> 02:36:01.196
MATT: She smirks a bit and says, "Oh, honey."

02:36:01.196 --> 02:36:07.217
LAURA: He did wear lots of rings on his fingers.

02:36:07.217 --> 02:36:12.627
MATT: "We had a bit of a romance years ago."

02:36:12.627 --> 02:36:15.813
SAM: How many years ago, by the way?

02:36:15.813 --> 02:36:20.551
MATT: "I told you about Babenon."

02:36:20.551 --> 02:36:23.102
SAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: Babenon?

02:36:23.102 --> 02:36:24.876
MATT: "Babenon Dosal."

02:36:24.876 --> 02:36:26.997
LAURA: I didn't ask if that was his name, though!

02:36:26.997 --> 02:36:29.525
SAM: Your dad's name is Bob?!

02:36:29.525 --> 02:36:32.271
(laughter)

02:36:32.271 --> 02:36:34.230
MATT: B-A-B.

02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:36.342
MARISHA: Wait, Bob Bobanon?

02:36:36.342 --> 02:36:38.084
MATT: B-A-B-E-N-O-N.

02:36:38.084 --> 02:36:39.113
LIAM: Bob Loblaw.

02:36:39.113 --> 02:36:40.562
MATT: Bob Loblaw's Law Blog.

02:36:40.562 --> 02:36:42.405
SAM: I have no idea what his name is.

02:36:42.405 --> 02:36:45.709
LAURA: Babenon. Babenon Dosal.

02:36:45.709 --> 02:36:48.096
MARISHA: Wait, Babenon what?

02:36:48.096 --> 02:36:50.264
SAM: Bob Babylon?

02:36:50.264 --> 02:36:53.309
MATT: "You say he's in Zadash now?"

02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:55.928
LAURA: But you said he lived in the ocean?

02:36:55.928 --> 02:36:57.929
MATT: "That's what he told me."

02:36:57.929 --> 02:37:07.313
LAURA: Oh my god. What if The Gentleman is my
dad?

02:37:07.313 --> 02:37:09.089
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

02:37:09.089 --> 02:37:11.609
LIAM: Are we saying if, or are we saying is?

02:37:11.609 --> 02:37:13.899
LAURA: Well, we don't know for sure.

02:37:13.899 --> 02:37:15.915
LIAM: Your mother might know for sure.

02:37:15.915 --> 02:37:18.624
LAURA: Do you have a picture of him? Do you have a
drawing of him?

02:37:18.624 --> 02:37:23.234
SAM: Why don't you draw The Gentleman? You've
probably got drawings of him in your book!

02:37:23.234 --> 02:37:25.064
LAURA: I've got a drawing of The Gentleman in my
sketchbook!

02:37:25.064 --> 02:37:30.542
TALIESIN: This is the perfect time for a game of
Pictionary. I'm so excited. Both of you, don't look.

02:37:30.542 --> 02:37:33.177
SAM: Yeah, you draw one and she draws one!

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.813
MARISHA: And then compare!

02:37:34.813 --> 02:37:36.773
TRAVIS: Draw off!

02:37:36.773 --> 02:37:40.905
LIAM: I'd like to think the party is legitimately
this excited.

02:37:40.905 --> 02:37:42.873
MARISHA: Oh hell yeah we are!

02:37:42.873 --> 02:37:44.439
TALIESIN: I don't understand what's happening.

02:37:44.439 --> 02:37:48.614
MARISHA: This is the best episode of Maury ever!

02:37:48.614 --> 02:38:01.414
MATT: Marion seems both present and not. She's
trying to process all of this. She reaches over

02:38:01.414 --> 02:38:08.498
and goes to her counter and begins drawing. She's
not anywhere as good an artist as her daughter.

02:38:08.498 --> 02:38:11.100
LAURA: Well, this is pure gold, what's happening
here.

02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:15.286
TALIESIN: It is amazing what's happening over
here. Oh yeah.

02:38:15.286 --> 02:38:19.841
MARISHA: I'm glad that an offhand joke about The
Gentleman led to this.

02:38:19.841 --> 02:38:22.065
LIAM: That is the cartoon character Daria.

02:38:22.065 --> 02:38:24.688
TRAVIS: Those are some huge sweat drops.

02:38:24.688 --> 02:38:26.860
MARISHA: Wait, let me see.

02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.957
LAURA: It looks like Daria.

02:38:28.957 --> 02:38:31.645
SAM: Daria with a beard.

02:38:31.645 --> 02:38:37.891
LAURA: Jester's a really good drawer, even though
I'm not.

02:38:37.891 --> 02:38:46.942
TALIESIN: Yep, there's no getting around it.

02:38:46.942 --> 02:38:53.288
LAURA: Imagine this is, like, DaVinci.

02:38:53.288 --> 02:38:56.956
MARISHA: It's very Scott Pilgrim. Have you seen
this woman?

02:38:57.348 --> 02:38:59.429
SAM: Are you drawing, Matt, right now?

02:38:59.429 --> 02:39:01.487
MATT: Well, yeah! If you're going to draw a
picture, I'm going to draw one real fast too.

02:39:01.487 --> 02:39:04.601
MARISHA: Matt's a really good drawer.

02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:09.316
MATT: Not at this speed I'm not, no, I'm not.
She's not a good artist either, so she's like--

02:39:09.316 --> 02:39:12.997
SAM: That's so much better!

02:39:12.997 --> 02:39:16.114
LAURA: That is him!

02:39:16.114 --> 02:39:18.165
MARISHA: Let's see, let's see.

02:39:18.165 --> 02:39:22.736
TALIESIN: Does it look like the same person when
we look at the two drawings?

02:39:22.736 --> 02:39:25.559
MATT: You can make a connection.

02:39:25.559 --> 02:39:27.120
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:29.025
MARISHA: So is it the same person? We need to know
that.

02:39:29.025 --> 02:39:41.494
TRAVIS: Jester, that is quite the revelation. Your
dad-- I mean, Babenon-- is tracking us.

02:39:41.494 --> 02:39:44.644
LAURA: He has our blood.

02:39:44.644 --> 02:39:51.766
MATT: "I am so confused by this, but you've talked
to him, you've seen him, you know where he is?"

02:39:51.766 --> 02:39:56.902
LAURA: Yeah, he's in Zadash! Do you want to go see
him?

02:39:56.902 --> 02:40:00.598
MATT: "I can't leave."

02:40:00.598 --> 02:40:04.613
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! I'm going to send
him a message, okay? And then we can see if it's

02:40:04.613 --> 02:40:07.711
him. I send a message to The Gentleman.

02:40:07.711 --> 02:40:09.613
MATT: Okay, what do you say?

02:40:09.613 --> 02:40:11.032
TRAVIS: Oh god.

02:40:11.032 --> 02:40:12.345
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:40:12.345 --> 02:40:19.351
LAURA: Oh my god, oh my god. Is your name Babenon
Dosal? Have you ever been to the Menagerie Coast?

02:40:19.351 --> 02:40:22.044
Oh my god, do you know the Ruby of the Sea? Oh my
god!

02:40:22.044 --> 02:40:24.850
MARISHA: He's going to think he's being
wiretapped.

02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:29.030
MATT: Okay, so the spell sends. No response.

02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:32.675
SAM: Maybe you should say, "This is Jester."

02:40:32.675 --> 02:40:35.726
LAURA: No, he's gotten my messages before; he
knows it's me.

02:40:35.726 --> 02:40:38.516
LIAM: That message probably interrupted a
threesome.

02:40:38.516 --> 02:40:44.989
LAURA: I've seen him having sex and stuff. We
haven't seen it, but we know.

02:40:44.989 --> 02:40:46.714
TRAVIS: Probably doesn't bother your mom.

02:40:46.714 --> 02:40:58.945
LAURA: But I wanted him to be true to her forever.
I'm going to try one more time.

02:40:58.945 --> 02:41:01.061
SAM: Oh gosh.

02:41:01.061 --> 02:41:03.298
LAURA: What do I have? Is it nighttime already?

02:41:03.298 --> 02:41:07.318
MATT: It's late evening. It's probably close to
midnight by now.

02:41:07.318 --> 02:41:14.999
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to think about what I'm
going to say on this one. I'm using my pearl of

02:41:14.999 --> 02:41:29.369
power. It's my last 3rd-level spell. Okay. Hello
Gentleman. This is Jester. Please respond. Just

02:41:29.371 --> 02:41:46.881
yes if you've seen the Ruby. Please. Is that 20?
Oh, oh shit! Balls!

02:41:47.038 --> 02:42:05.466
(laughter)

02:42:05.466 --> 02:42:07.695
MATT: Oh my god.

02:42:07.758 --> 02:42:10.373
TRAVIS: Please tell me it plays with those exact
pauses.

02:42:10.373 --> 02:42:12.403
MATT: Of course it does.

02:42:12.403 --> 02:42:17.840
LIAM: I want to hear some 1988 phone voicemail
message thrown on top of that.

02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:34.572
MATT: There is a palpable pause of nothing. And
then he responds, "No, that's preposterous."

02:42:34.572 --> 02:42:40.504
LAURA: That's preposterous, he says.

02:42:40.504 --> 02:42:45.619
MATT: "Maybe it is."

02:42:45.619 --> 02:42:52.849
MARISHA: Did the guy that you know use words like
"preposterous"?

02:42:52.849 --> 02:43:00.672
MATT: "I know a lot of people use the word
'preposterous.' It's a fairly standard word."

02:43:00.672 --> 02:43:05.819
MARISHA: Is it? I don't-- it feels-- okay.
Preposterous.

02:43:05.819 --> 02:43:10.951
MATT: "I'm sorry. Maybe I just got a bit excited.
My apologies."

02:43:10.951 --> 02:43:17.963
LAURA: I didn't even think to ask about him in
Zadash, because I thought he would be in the ocean.

02:43:17.963 --> 02:43:21.405
LIAM: In the ocean?

02:43:21.405 --> 02:43:24.156
LAURA: Yeah, he told Mama he was in the ocean!

02:43:24.156 --> 02:43:32.231
MATT: "Said he had to leave and take care of some
business on the sea. I never saw him again."

02:43:32.293 --> 02:43:34.674
SAM: Just like a man.

02:43:34.674 --> 02:43:44.694
MATT: "You're not wrong. But though he may be
gone, he left me with the greatest gift I've ever

02:43:44.694 --> 02:43:50.817
"had, so--" She runs her hands through your hair
once more. "For that, I'm thankful."

02:43:50.817 --> 02:43:53.994
MARISHA: Do you still love him?

02:43:53.994 --> 02:44:06.617
MATT: "Love is a funny thing. There's still a part
of my heart that will always be his. But it's been

02:44:06.617 --> 02:44:11.328
"decades. You move on."

02:44:11.328 --> 02:44:17.446
LAURA: Decades? Holy shit.

02:44:17.446 --> 02:44:20.381
MATT: That could mean literally two decades.

02:44:20.381 --> 02:44:22.080
TRAVIS: You're 60.

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:25.958
SAM: Do you not know how old you are?

02:44:25.958 --> 02:44:31.697
LAURA: Of course I know how old I am. I'm just
questioning my mom's math, is all.

02:44:31.697 --> 02:44:33.293
SAM: Decades could be 20 years.

02:44:33.293 --> 02:44:35.532
MARISHA: Or 30.

02:44:35.532 --> 02:44:39.281
LIAM: I'm 50, 50 years old. I kick--

02:44:39.281 --> 02:44:41.286
LAURA: I stretch!

02:44:41.286 --> 02:44:48.876
MATT: "Regardless." You can see she's flushed in
her face.

02:44:48.876 --> 02:44:56.355
SAM: We've gone through a lot tonight, so maybe
we'll leave you to your peace. You need to process

02:44:56.355 --> 02:45:04.513
some things, and then in the morning we'll go
not-murder this guy.

02:45:04.513 --> 02:45:11.405
LIAM: Definitely not. Definitely, Nott.

02:45:11.405 --> 02:45:13.817
SAM: Yes, I see what you did there.

02:45:13.817 --> 02:45:18.785
TALIESIN: I don't. Is there a thing? Oh well.

02:45:18.785 --> 02:45:23.270
MATT: "I will have rooms arranged. I will send the
servants to get it taken care of. You will have

02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:29.235
"the finest suites at the inn for the better part
of this week, and longer if need be. Just let me

02:45:29.235 --> 02:45:35.647
"know." You can see she's a bit shaken by
everything, but trying to put on the facade that

02:45:35.647 --> 02:45:45.629
she's good. "Anyway, it is a pleasure. Thank you
for the companionship, for the words, for the

02:45:45.629 --> 02:45:56.331
"stories, and for bringing me my little sapphire. I
should probably sleep. Good night."

02:45:56.331 --> 02:45:57.885
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:45:57.885 --> 02:46:05.769
MATT: "Thank you, thank you. If you need
anything-- to be shown, taught-- I have friends

02:46:05.769 --> 02:46:07.412
"who can help you."

02:46:07.412 --> 02:46:11.248
TALIESIN: I don't understand what that--

02:46:11.248 --> 02:46:14.163
SAM: It's a freebie. You can have sex with
someone.

02:46:14.163 --> 02:46:16.357
MATT: "Well--"

02:46:16.357 --> 02:46:18.940
LAURA: Not a freebie.

02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:21.905
TALIESIN: That's fine. Let's-- go ahead.

02:46:21.905 --> 02:46:25.845
LIAM: Oh, I was going to ask if she could recommend
any bookstores, but I was mistaken about

02:46:25.845 --> 02:46:27.555
what the topic was.

02:46:27.555 --> 02:46:30.014
TALIESIN: No, you might not have been. I don't
know.

02:46:30.014 --> 02:46:32.821
LIAM: Can you recommend any bookstores here in the
city?

02:46:32.821 --> 02:46:39.478
MATT: "I don't really go out to the bookstores. I
have books brought to me, but you may look around.

02:46:39.478 --> 02:46:41.984
"There are a handful, I'm certain."

02:46:41.984 --> 02:46:45.663
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

02:46:45.663 --> 02:46:47.742
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's call it a night. Thank you.

02:46:47.742 --> 02:46:54.538
MATT: "Good night." And she pours her glass full,
holds it, and "Sleep well." And she kisses you on

02:46:54.538 --> 02:46:57.140
the forehead.

02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:58.729
LAURA: Goodnight, Mama.

02:46:58.729 --> 02:47:01.485
MATT: "Good night, Jester." Closes the door.

02:47:01.485 --> 02:47:06.174
LIAM: Caleb, for all of this for the last hour,
has been trying to figure out if she seems okay.

02:47:06.174 --> 02:47:09.152
So in this moment, does she seem okay?

02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:13.994
MATT: I don't think she seems okay.

02:47:13.994 --> 02:47:24.354
LIAM: But you know what I mean? Even prior to
finding out that news, I mean seeing her mother.

02:47:24.354 --> 02:47:30.553
I'm saying for the entire evening here, even
before that.

02:47:30.553 --> 02:47:33.584
MATT: Well, that'd be more of a question for her.

02:47:33.584 --> 02:47:37.392
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm not asking. I'm just
wondering.

02:47:37.392 --> 02:47:42.673
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

02:47:42.673 --> 02:47:54.211
LAURA: Well, kind of stupid for not thinking to
ask The Gentleman when we met him, but--

02:47:54.211 --> 02:47:55.423
LIAM: Ask him what?

02:47:55.423 --> 02:47:57.781
SAM: He didn't ask you.

02:47:57.781 --> 02:48:00.556
MARISHA: Hey, crime boss, are you my dad?

02:48:00.556 --> 02:48:04.849
LAURA: I did think it was fun that we were meeting
somebody else who was blue.

02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:07.927
TALIESIN: There's a lot of blue people in the
world.

02:48:07.927 --> 02:48:08.846
LAURA: Are there?

02:48:08.846 --> 02:48:10.654
TALIESIN: I assume.

02:48:10.654 --> 02:48:13.470
LIAM: You're also not constantly perspiring or
anything.

02:48:13.470 --> 02:48:15.956
TALIESIN: Only just now.

02:48:16.250 --> 02:48:17.806
LAURA: That's true.

02:48:17.806 --> 02:48:24.887
TRAVIS: Did you want to have a drink and think
about it, or go for a walk?

02:48:24.887 --> 02:48:29.635
SAM: Or a swim.

02:48:29.635 --> 02:48:34.562
LAURA: Why would I need a swim?

02:48:34.562 --> 02:48:36.782
SAM: I don't know, because you're half water
person?

02:48:36.782 --> 02:48:39.366
LAURA: Oh.

02:48:39.366 --> 02:48:41.906
LIAM: Nott, are you going to go swimming with
her?

02:48:41.906 --> 02:48:45.373
SAM: If she wanted me to, I could.

02:48:45.373 --> 02:48:46.891
LAURA: Really?

02:48:46.891 --> 02:48:50.811
SAM: I would do that for you.

02:48:50.811 --> 02:48:52.815
TRAVIS: What about a night swim?

02:48:52.815 --> 02:48:57.109
LAURA: It's actually pretty dangerous to go
through the Skews at night.

02:48:57.109 --> 02:49:03.829
SAM: Yeah, that's what I thought. Can I see if
your fingers are webbed or anything?

02:49:03.829 --> 02:49:08.712
LAURA: They're not webbed. What if he's my dad,
you guys?

02:49:08.712 --> 02:49:18.453
SAM: Well, then you've had nothing but positive
interactions with him, right? What did we do with

02:49:18.453 --> 02:49:20.584
him? Did we do anything weird?

02:49:20.584 --> 02:49:25.996
TRAVIS: We've done very right by him, but we've
also tipped him off to the fact that you assume

02:49:25.996 --> 02:49:30.629
that he might know your mother at a more intimate
level.

02:49:30.629 --> 02:49:33.664
LAURA: Is that bad that I put that out there?

02:49:33.664 --> 02:49:37.069
MARISHA: I guess it depends on if he's trying to
hide it or not.

02:49:37.069 --> 02:49:40.397
TRAVIS: Would be nice to see his face when you ask
the question, you know what I mean?

02:49:40.397 --> 02:49:44.296
TALIESIN: This is the sort of conversation one
should have in person, I suppose.

02:49:44.296 --> 02:49:49.127
LIAM: It's a question mark right now, but there
will be another chapter to that story.

02:49:49.127 --> 02:49:53.633
LAURA: I'll just send him messages every day.

02:49:53.633 --> 02:49:55.639
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Well--

02:49:55.639 --> 02:49:58.121
SAM: I don't know if that's a good idea.

02:49:58.121 --> 02:50:03.593
LIAM: Why don't you give him a few days to
ruminate on what you have just said, and see if

02:50:03.593 --> 02:50:09.467
anything returns? Or maybe we will return. It's
your decision.

02:50:09.467 --> 02:50:12.819
LAURA: It's going to be so long before we go back
to Zadash, maybe.

02:50:12.819 --> 02:50:16.877
LIAM: At the very least, I think you should sleep
on it.

02:50:16.877 --> 02:50:18.883
LAURA: Okay.

02:50:18.883 --> 02:50:22.662
TRAVIS: Should we turn in for the night, then?

02:50:22.662 --> 02:50:25.033
LAURA: I guess so. It's pretty late.

02:50:25.033 --> 02:50:27.645
LIAM: I bet you'll go right to sleep, <i>ja</i>?

02:50:27.645 --> 02:50:29.469
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

02:50:29.469 --> 02:50:32.015
MARISHA: What stories did your mom tell you about
your dad?

02:50:32.015 --> 02:50:47.846
LAURA: Just that he was very charming, and that he
wore lots of rings on his fingers, and that, you know--

02:50:48.490 --> 02:50:49.903
TRAVIS: He came from the sea?

02:50:49.903 --> 02:50:59.969
LAURA: Well, that he lived on an island in the
sea. And they were going to get married. He said

02:50:59.969 --> 02:51:05.078
he wanted to and he went to prepare his house and
never came back. She thought maybe something bad

02:51:05.078 --> 02:51:06.933
happened to him.

02:51:06.933 --> 02:51:12.504
TALIESIN: Perhaps he's hiding, which is why he
couldn't answer that question.

02:51:12.504 --> 02:51:19.956
LAURA: But she said he was very charming and very
sweet and very funny. He always made her laugh.

02:51:19.956 --> 02:51:27.517
LIAM: It's good that you got to see your mother,
though. You seem very happy to see her.

02:51:27.517 --> 02:51:31.705
LAURA: I am. She's really wonderful, isn't she?

02:51:31.705 --> 02:51:33.287
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

02:51:33.287 --> 02:51:34.859
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:51:34.859 --> 02:51:37.598
LAURA: We should go to sleep.

02:51:37.598 --> 02:51:39.300
SAM: All right.

02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:48.828
MATT: Your rooms are arranged for you. They're
Pillow Trove-level presentation. The interior is

02:51:48.828 --> 02:51:52.712
warm and the beds are ostentatious.

02:51:52.712 --> 02:51:57.031
TRAVIS: Four poster, gaudy-ass--

02:51:57.031 --> 02:52:02.381
MATT: Yeah. From what you guys are used to
sleeping in, you almost don't know what to do with

02:52:02.381 --> 02:52:05.401
it once you lie in bed. It's almost too
comfortable.

02:52:05.404 --> 02:52:07.304
LIAM: Are they all kings?

02:52:07.304 --> 02:52:14.422
MATT: Roughly, yeah. Queen to king. You all
managed to find yourself some rest for the

02:52:14.422 --> 02:52:25.781
evening, some more tense than others. Some setting
up invisible threads. The morning comes. With the

02:52:25.781 --> 02:52:33.350
light of the sunrise, you open your windows and
look out over the ocean and the city below. You

02:52:33.350 --> 02:52:40.625
can smell the salty air. The marine layer has
brought in a familiar gray sky to those of you who

02:52:40.625 --> 02:52:47.883
grew up to the more northern regions of
Wildemount. You can still hear the distant calls

02:52:47.883 --> 02:52:55.675
and caws of the flying seagulls and ocean birds.
You can see some of the higher buildings and

02:52:55.675 --> 02:53:01.295
towers with their little perched clusters. You
watch as a few dive down into the merchant

02:53:01.295 --> 02:53:06.275
districts of the city and some distant echoing
yells as they shoot back up with a caught fish

02:53:06.275 --> 02:53:12.774
that was supposed to be sold. The ships are
already out and starting their day. You can see

02:53:12.774 --> 02:53:19.320
maybe 20 or so that are out in the main harbor and
scattering further to find their specific areas to

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.629
begin throwing their nets into the water. The
morning is yours.

02:53:22.629 --> 02:53:25.008
TRAVIS: How'd you sleep, Jester?

02:53:25.008 --> 02:53:28.920
LAURA: Great! I slept really good.

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:32.932
TRAVIS: You know, I was thinking one thing that
might help take your mind off this is making sure

02:53:32.932 --> 02:53:39.454
your mom stays safe. Right? Take some solid steps
to making sure that-- Galdar?

02:53:39.454 --> 02:53:41.746
ALL: Algar.

02:53:41.746 --> 02:53:43.370
SAM: Algar Dyomin.

02:53:43.370 --> 02:53:44.943
LAURA: That he stops.

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:47.027
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:53:47.027 --> 02:53:48.761
SAM: Let's go find him.

02:53:48.761 --> 02:53:50.336
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:50.336 --> 02:53:51.882
SAM: I have an idea.

02:53:51.882 --> 02:53:53.700
LAURA: Okay, what's your idea?

02:53:53.700 --> 02:54:03.208
SAM: If you go on a date with him, fall in love
with him, get pregnant, then he'll want to settle

02:54:03.208 --> 02:54:07.741
down and make you an honest woman and he'll never
go back to your mom again.

02:54:07.741 --> 02:54:13.923
LAURA: That's perfect, but then I might have to
stay with him. I don't want to do that.

02:54:13.923 --> 02:54:19.124
TRAVIS: There is actually a lot to do this
morning. I feel like we should send some to check

02:54:19.124 --> 02:54:23.653
out the lighthouse, maybe talk to the Wharfmaster,
and maybe send someone to--

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:25.935
MARISHA: Maybe go to this Open Quay.

02:54:25.935 --> 02:54:29.164
TRAVIS: Yeah, just some lax scouting, you know?

02:54:29.164 --> 02:54:30.765
TALIESIN: I'll head to the lighthouse.

02:54:30.765 --> 02:54:34.919
SAM: We're trying to find him? Where he lives? Who
he works for?

02:54:34.919 --> 02:54:36.611
TRAVIS: Anything, I think.

02:54:36.611 --> 02:54:38.176
TALIESIN: Survey the territory.

02:54:38.176 --> 02:54:43.091
LIAM: You should probably be speaking to the
people on the docks, yeah?

02:54:43.091 --> 02:54:45.177
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to find the
Wharfmaster.

02:54:45.177 --> 02:54:56.958
LAURA: I wonder where the Concord-- yeah, where
they're based. Isn't there a headquarters?

02:54:56.958 --> 02:55:00.557
MATT: Actually the palace-like center here--

02:55:00.557 --> 02:55:01.755
LAURA: The Marquis?

02:55:01.755 --> 02:55:07.004
MATT: The Marquis is the head of the local chapter
of the Concord that looks over Nicodranas. The

02:55:07.004 --> 02:55:12.238
Concord itself is a loose union between all the
cities in the Menagerie Coast. There's a margrave

02:55:12.238 --> 02:55:17.076
in each city that is the head of the city but then
works with the other margraves to interface and

02:55:17.076 --> 02:55:22.207
make sure everything's good, bad, and business is
well. That would be the center of Concord

02:55:22.207 --> 02:55:24.007
influence here.

02:55:24.007 --> 02:55:25.367
LAURA: Okay.

02:55:25.367 --> 02:55:30.936
TRAVIS: We've managed to enter relatively quietly.
I think if we can maintain a certain level of

02:55:30.936 --> 02:55:36.836
anonymity, we can acquire some decent knowledge.
Meet back here in a little while and share?

02:55:36.836 --> 02:55:38.868
MARISHA: Do you want to do two groups?

02:55:38.868 --> 02:55:42.502
TRAVIS: I suppose we could. Lighthouse and the
Wharfmaster?

02:55:42.502 --> 02:55:44.030
MARISHA: All right.

02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:45.258
TALIESIN: Works for me.

02:55:45.258 --> 02:55:47.048
MARISHA: Maybe we can all meet up at the Quay
afterwards.

02:55:47.048 --> 02:55:48.797
TRAVIS: Ooh, I like it.

02:55:48.797 --> 02:55:50.165
MARISHA: The Open Quay.

02:55:50.165 --> 02:55:51.610
TALIESIN: That's a great idea.

02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:52.807
TRAVIS: Midday?

02:55:52.807 --> 02:55:54.687
SAM: Midday at the Quay?

02:55:54.687 --> 02:55:56.234
MARISHA: Midday at the quay.

02:55:56.234 --> 02:55:57.608
SAM: What do you say?

02:55:57.608 --> 02:55:59.368
MARISHA: I say okay.

02:55:59.368 --> 02:56:02.074
SAM: The Wharfmaster is going to tell us what
now?

02:56:02.074 --> 02:56:04.403
LAURA: Yeah, why are we talking to the
Wharfmaster?

02:56:04.403 --> 02:56:06.577
TRAVIS: I would like to talk to the Wharfmaster.

02:56:06.577 --> 02:56:08.750
SAM: Oh, you want to go talk to the Wharfmaster.
Great.

02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:12.709
TRAVIS: Plus it would be a good chance to ask
around about Algar. He's influential in the city.

02:56:12.709 --> 02:56:16.523
LIAM: In Zemnian, it's pronounced "key." You said
"quay"?

02:56:16.523 --> 02:56:19.868
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:56:19.868 --> 02:56:22.351
SAM: What is a quay?

02:56:22.351 --> 02:56:25.624
LAURA: I'm so confused. Let's go.

02:56:25.624 --> 02:56:27.158
SAM: Okay.

02:56:27.158 --> 02:56:28.827
TRAVIS: Who's going to the lighthouse?

02:56:28.827 --> 02:56:31.810
SAM: People who can talk. They said that she's
ornery.

02:56:31.810 --> 02:56:35.819
TRAVIS: Okay. You three. Nott, do you want to come
to the Wharfmaster so you can take a swim?

02:56:35.819 --> 02:56:38.085
SAM: I'll go to the lighthouse.

02:56:38.085 --> 02:56:40.186
TALIESIN: Also on the water.

02:56:40.186 --> 02:56:41.428
MARISHA: I'll go with you.

02:56:41.428 --> 02:56:42.751
TRAVIS: Yeah. Guns out.

02:56:42.751 --> 02:56:46.031
SAM: What about you, Jessie?

02:56:46.031 --> 02:56:49.510
LAURA: I'm going to the lighthouse, I said.

02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:53.079
TRAVIS: Four to the lighthouse, two to the
Wharfmaster. I like it.

02:56:53.079 --> 02:56:59.824
MATT: Okay. Heading to the Wharfmaster is Fjord
and Beau?

02:56:59.824 --> 02:57:02.100
MARISHA: Biceps and triceps.

02:57:02.100 --> 02:57:13.095
TRAVIS: Before we get there, I pull Beau aside.
All right, so this is my turf.

02:57:13.095 --> 02:57:14.307
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:57:14.307 --> 02:57:19.455
TRAVIS: There may be some familiar faces. We came
in before and I didn't change the way I looked. I

02:57:19.455 --> 02:57:23.723
wanted to see if maybe that caused a rustle. I'm
going to change the way I look now.

02:57:23.723 --> 02:57:27.306
MARISHA: Okay. You didn't notice anything before
when you came in as is?

02:57:27.306 --> 02:57:28.800
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:30.402
MARISHA: Do people not like you here?

02:57:30.402 --> 02:57:38.570
TRAVIS: I don't know. I want to ask about my old
crew and my captain. Son of a bitch betrayed us

02:57:38.570 --> 02:57:43.205
and all that. I don't want people to know that I'm
alive. When I was back in Port Damali and I went

02:57:43.205 --> 02:57:49.073
looking through stuff, my mere presence there when
none of the rest crew was was enough to get looks.

02:57:49.073 --> 02:57:53.232
It's what drove me out, so I think I'll be able to
discover more if--

02:57:53.232 --> 02:57:54.723
MARISHA: If you're not--

02:57:54.723 --> 02:57:56.437
TRAVIS: -- me. Yeah.

02:57:56.437 --> 02:58:05.770
MARISHA: Deal. Am I your servant, your bodyguard?
Am I your yes-man? I can be your yes-man.

02:58:05.770 --> 02:58:07.481
LIAM: Hype man.

02:58:07.481 --> 02:58:09.172
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah.

02:58:09.172 --> 02:58:10.556
MARISHA: Copy that.

02:58:10.556 --> 02:58:20.072
TRAVIS: Yep. I'll use Mask of Many Faces to make
myself look like a very tanned human with jet

02:58:20.072 --> 02:58:31.615
black hair pulled back into a tight ponytail in the
back. With a black goatee. Maybe slightly overweight.

02:58:31.629 --> 02:58:34.900
(laughter)

02:58:35.056 --> 02:58:37.228
TRAVIS: Had some better days in the '80s.

02:58:37.228 --> 02:58:39.486
MATT: All right, Steven. So you--

02:58:39.486 --> 02:58:41.934
LIAM: Russian accent. Vague.

02:58:41.934 --> 02:58:43.806
TRAVIS: My name is Sheagal.

02:58:43.806 --> 02:58:45.223
MATT: Okay.

02:58:45.223 --> 02:58:48.511
TRAVIS: (Sean Connery voice) Steven Seagal.

02:58:48.511 --> 02:58:53.225
LIAM: You cannot mix those two impressions
together. It's too dangerous.

02:58:53.283 --> 02:58:57.247
(Sean Connery voice) I suddennly remembered
my Charlemagne. (normal voice) Doesn't work.

02:58:57.484 --> 02:59:04.201
MATT: Doesn't work. The two of you make your way
back to the Restless Wharf. You're searching for

02:59:04.201 --> 02:59:07.318
the Wharfmaster, specifically? Make an
investigation check.

02:59:07.318 --> 02:59:11.805
TRAVIS: Oh god, yes. I know what that modifier is.
No!

02:59:11.805 --> 02:59:14.652
MATT: And since Beau's helping you you can do
advantage on that one.

02:59:14.652 --> 02:59:22.402
TRAVIS: Thank you. That was the same roll both
times. That was really shit. Eight.

02:59:22.402 --> 02:59:26.154
MATT: Okay. Beau, have you retrieved the
Professor, or have you left it with the inn?

02:59:26.154 --> 02:59:28.335
MARISHA: He's staying at the inn.

02:59:28.335 --> 02:59:35.234
MATT: Okay. You spend the better part of two hours
or so wandering up and down the wharf, asking

02:59:35.234 --> 02:59:42.966
questions, before you eventually have somebody
point you over. "If you looking for the

02:59:42.966 --> 02:59:47.834
"Wharfmaster, he's at the Wharf Load right there,"
and points over one of the larger center parts of

02:59:47.834 --> 02:59:55.345
the dock that jettisons out into the harbor a good
hundred or so feet. There is a central dock house

02:59:55.345 --> 03:00:00.734
that is one of the buildings you saw when you
first entered, where you saw a lot of the business

03:00:00.734 --> 03:00:04.226
was bustling around, although it is not as busy as
it was at dusk when you first entered the city.

03:00:04.226 --> 03:00:08.318
MARISHA: Of course the Wharfmaster is at the
Wharf Load. We probably should have checked

03:00:08.374 --> 03:00:09.666
there first. Why didn't we do that?

03:00:09.666 --> 03:00:11.025
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know.

03:00:11.025 --> 03:00:16.637
MATT: But as you approach the building, you open
the front door and someone is pushing past you.

03:00:16.749 --> 03:00:20.935
There are a handful of Zolezzo looking around, but
it looks like entering the Wharf Load isn't a

03:00:20.935 --> 03:00:27.106
notably guarded experience. So as you enter, there
is one Zolezzo across the way that is sitting in a

03:00:27.106 --> 03:00:37.195
chair and looking out and chewing on some sort of
rough tobacco-like leaf in their jaw. Across the

03:00:37.195 --> 03:00:43.220
way, you can see a couple of folks-- humans-- in
the process of filing out big leather books,

03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:52.727
ledgers, and receipt books of various people
traveling through. And you see in the back over a

03:00:52.727 --> 03:01:03.335
table with a bunch of papers rolled out, either
charting maps or large assembled lists of previous

03:01:03.335 --> 03:01:13.066
excursions. You see a male dwarf, probably middle
to older age, red hair that tends to eventually

03:01:13.066 --> 03:01:19.353
expire into a deep gray at the end of this really
curly matted beard. You see big, gold, thick

03:01:19.353 --> 03:01:25.653
earrings that hoop from each earlobe-- the weight
of this heavy, thick lobe has dragged the ears to

03:01:25.653 --> 03:01:33.730
stretch a bit past the face. The hairline comes in
a deep widow's peak, that recedes almost back to

03:01:33.730 --> 03:01:41.006
the top of the head before coming in, and there
you can see, in a similar tangled tuft, the rest

03:01:41.006 --> 03:01:49.494
of his hair that coasts past his shoulders before
it exerts into a strange puff. He is wearing a

03:01:49.494 --> 03:01:56.784
simple leather tunic over a work uniform, but
three or four fairly expensive necklaces or

03:01:56.784 --> 03:02:02.461
amulets that clatter around as he moves. You get
the sense of his placement by the other

03:02:02.465 --> 03:02:06.266
individuals going up and asking him questions,
he's probably the Wharfmaster.

03:02:06.282 --> 03:02:09.368
TRAVIS: I'll make my way up to him, if he's not
busy.

03:02:09.488 --> 03:02:14.110
MATT: He looks busy, and there is a counter that
prevents you from traveling in without going

03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:18.698
around it. As you begin to make your way
around the counter, one of the individuals up

03:02:18.698 --> 03:02:22.679
there puts his hand out. "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Can
I help you?"

03:02:23.031 --> 03:02:27.103
TRAVIS: (raspy, older voice) Yes, I'm so sorry, I
was wondering if I might be able to speak with the

03:02:27.103 --> 03:02:32.044
Wharfmaster. And I'll produce two gold coins and
start to rub them together.

03:02:32.044 --> 03:02:36.637
MATT: "I'll see what I can do." He takes the coins
and pockets them, and walks behind and begins

03:02:36.637 --> 03:02:40.616
whispering. The dwarf puts his hand up for a
second and finishes making a couple measurements

03:02:40.616 --> 03:02:48.915
and then, "Huh. All right." He jumps off his small
stool and comes over with heavy footsteps across

03:02:48.915 --> 03:02:57.441
the wooden, creaking floor now extending over the
wharf. He approaches the edge of the counter

03:02:57.441 --> 03:03:03.039
across from you and goes, "Right, so you've
summoned me to you. What can I do to help you?"

03:03:03.039 --> 03:03:08.839
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, we're quite new in town,
unfortunately, my companion and I. We are from

03:03:08.839 --> 03:03:16.787
Port Damali, where we are trying to put down our
business roots here. I'm sorry, does Vandren and

03:03:16.787 --> 03:03:22.788
his crew, do they make shipments here regularly?
It's one of my return clients.

03:03:22.788 --> 03:03:24.885
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:03:24.885 --> 03:03:34.490
TRAVIS: 26, off of a natural 19.

03:03:34.608 --> 03:03:37.164
MATT: Did you have advantage on that?

03:03:37.164 --> 03:03:41.488
TRAVIS: Oh. Why did I roll advantage on that?

03:03:41.559 --> 03:03:42.730
MATT: What was your first roll?

03:03:42.730 --> 03:03:47.386
TRAVIS: 20. Why did I do that? Sorry.

03:03:47.386 --> 03:03:52.237
MATT: I don't know, just double checking. He
looks at you and goes, "Hold on a second."

03:03:52.237 --> 03:03:59.867
You see his gears turning and he goes through a
couple books. "Unfortunately, by the records

03:03:59.867 --> 03:04:05.135
"records we have here, Vandren and his ship was
lost at sea months ago."

03:04:05.135 --> 03:04:06.951
TRAVIS: You don't say.

03:04:06.951 --> 03:04:09.070
MATT: "I apologize."

03:04:09.070 --> 03:04:17.854
TRAVIS: That's quite unfortunate. I've been given
a task here in town. Algar, does he do a lot of

03:04:17.854 --> 03:04:20.375
business here on the wharf?

03:04:20.375 --> 03:04:23.814
MATT: "Yes, he comes and goes rather commonly,
yes."

03:04:23.814 --> 03:04:28.217
TRAVIS: I happen to have crossed paths with him
one night while drinking. I guess we made quite

03:04:28.224 --> 03:04:35.625
the impression on him, and we are to deliver some
items to his place of residence. However, my

03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:43.051
friend here was shit-faced and we forgot to ask
where he lives. I was hoping, perhaps, if you

03:04:43.051 --> 03:04:47.083
could give us a point in the right direction?

03:04:47.083 --> 03:04:50.723
MATT: "I honestly don't know where he lives. But I
know where he works."

03:04:50.723 --> 03:04:53.708
TRAVIS: Oh yes, then, that would be most helpful.

03:04:53.708 --> 03:04:56.836
MATT: "All right, he works in the Sluice Weave."

03:04:56.836 --> 03:05:02.134
TRAVIS: The Sluice Weave. Not loose leaf, Sluice
Weave.

03:05:02.134 --> 03:05:09.033
MATT: "The Sluice Weave." S-L-U-I-C-E. Sluice
Weave.

03:05:09.107 --> 03:05:12.846
MARISHA: I definitely wrote down "Sloose Sweef."

03:05:12.853 --> 03:05:17.017
MATT: Sloose Sweef! There you go.

03:05:17.017 --> 03:05:26.007
TRAVIS: Oh fantastic, that helps us immensely. Do
you know of anyone else looking for a merchant,

03:05:26.007 --> 03:05:29.625
perhaps on the cheaper side, services?

03:05:29.766 --> 03:05:31.924
MARISHA: We sell things.

03:05:31.924 --> 03:05:37.477
TRAVIS: Yes, rare things and very boring things,
at times.

03:05:37.477 --> 03:05:44.137
MATT: "If you are looking to sell, you are welcome
to go to either Meandering Treasures, here in the

03:05:44.278 --> 03:05:54.544
"Restless Wharf. They tend to pay, maybe not
top change, but quickly. As far as Dezima does

03:05:54.544 --> 03:05:57.288
his business, usually."

03:05:57.288 --> 03:05:59.057
TRAVIS: Dezima?

03:05:59.057 --> 03:06:02.006
MATT: "Dezima. He is the proprietor of the
Meandering Treasures."

03:06:02.006 --> 03:06:13.305
TRAVIS: Wonderful. This has been most helpful.
Well, I thank you for your time. Are there any

03:06:13.305 --> 03:06:20.543
available docks for rent or for lease if we happen
to come upon some vessels or ships?

03:06:20.619 --> 03:06:24.124
MATT: "We have--" and he looks back to one of his
sheets of paper and pulls it out for a second and

03:06:24.124 --> 03:06:30.602
looks at it. "We currently have eight dock spaces
not spoken for that are available for rent, if

03:06:30.602 --> 03:06:33.332
"that is your interest. Depending on the size of
the vessel, of course."

03:06:33.332 --> 03:06:37.603
MARISHA: Seems like a lot of dock spaces. Have a
lot of openings? Business been slow?

03:06:37.603 --> 03:06:42.106
MATT: "No, we've just had a lot of ships leave
recently. There is a lot of movement in and out."

03:06:42.106 --> 03:06:44.330
MARISHA: Oh sure. Just curious.

03:06:44.330 --> 03:06:50.508
TRAVIS: One other thing, we heard a gentleman over
at the bar speaking, and someone called out to

03:06:50.508 --> 03:06:58.412
him, "Marius LePual." Does that ring-- how do you
say that name?

03:06:58.412 --> 03:07:01.256
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:07:01.256 --> 03:07:04.122
TRAVIS: How were we saying the last name?

03:07:04.122 --> 03:07:07.750
LIAM: Les Paul.

03:07:07.755 --> 03:07:12.342
TRAVIS: 15.

03:07:12.342 --> 03:07:17.969
MATT: He's like, "I've seen him around. He's a
dubious sort of prick."

03:07:18.183 --> 03:07:25.471
TRAVIS: Yes, very gregarious personality from what
we could see. What does he do exactly?

03:07:25.471 --> 03:07:31.287
MATT: "Fuck if I know, to be honest. He takes up
space. He's done some work at the docks here and

03:07:31.648 --> 03:07:36.614
"there, but he rubs me the wrong way. Probably
find him drinking at any of the dives."

03:07:36.614 --> 03:07:40.368
TRAVIS: That is where we should look.

03:07:40.368 --> 03:07:42.631
MATT: "If not drowned already."

03:07:42.631 --> 03:07:49.467
TRAVIS: Ah, yes. We did notice actually last
night, there seemed to be an influx of strange

03:07:49.467 --> 03:07:54.080
characters coming in last night. Did you happen to
see anything around this area?

03:07:54.080 --> 03:07:57.293
MATT: "There were some strange cats that came in
last night off the docks, yes."

03:07:57.293 --> 03:08:01.972
TRAVIS: Anything in particular that caught your
eye?

03:08:02.031 --> 03:08:07.861
MATT: He starts giving you a curious look. "You're
asking a lot of questions for a person I've just met."

03:08:07.861 --> 03:08:13.128
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I'm so new here. I was just
hoping to acclimate myself and perhaps--

03:08:13.128 --> 03:08:19.363
MATT: "Of course. Let me give you a very
prestigious piece of advice, I think that will

03:08:19.363 --> 03:08:23.057
"help you in your business dealings here: Don't
ask so many questions."

03:08:23.057 --> 03:08:27.808
TRAVIS: Ah. Yes. Perhaps it's time we take our
leave.

03:08:27.808 --> 03:08:29.439
MARISHA: (grunts)

03:08:29.439 --> 03:08:32.071
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:08:32.071 --> 03:08:35.363
MARISHA: Sorry, salt water air is not (coughs)
used to it.

03:08:35.363 --> 03:08:43.826
MATT: "Good day." Then he turns back and clomps
back over to his table and is working, but keeps

03:08:43.826 --> 03:08:46.094
looking up expectantly waiting for you to leave.
And kind of like--

03:08:46.094 --> 03:08:50.853
TRAVIS: Maybe we do like the three backward steps
and then the turn and then both walk out.

03:08:50.876 --> 03:08:55.188
MARISHA: That went well, right? That was really
great, right? I was fucking awesome!

03:08:55.188 --> 03:08:56.658
TRAVIS: Yeah, you were great!

03:08:56.834 --> 03:09:01.174
MARISHA: Thank you! I was just following
your lead, man. You know, just nodding.

03:09:01.174 --> 03:09:05.589
TRAVIS: Yeah, that came out of nowhere. You got a
lot better at that. Okay. So, I don't know, where

03:09:05.589 --> 03:09:10.000
do we start? Well, I guess we meet back up with
the others.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.360
MARISHA: And he said that guy hangs out at the
dives.

03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:13.564
TRAVIS: I know.

03:09:13.564 --> 03:09:15.725
MARISHA: So like, two birds, one stone?

03:09:15.725 --> 03:09:19.280
TRAVIS: Smash. All right, let's get him.

03:09:19.280 --> 03:09:20.987
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

03:09:20.987 --> 03:09:26.224
TRAVIS: We're going to head to-- what time is it,
ish?

03:09:26.224 --> 03:09:27.840
MARISHA: Yeah, it is mid-day?

03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:33.322
MATT: At this point in time, I'd say it's probably
a little past noon since the morning.

03:09:33.322 --> 03:09:34.960
TRAVIS: Oh shit, fuck.

03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:36.350
MARISHA: It's mid-day.

03:09:36.350 --> 03:09:38.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should go meet with the others.

03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:39.528
MARISHA: Yeah. We go to the Open Quay.

03:09:39.528 --> 03:09:48.561
MATT: Okay. So you guys heading there to meet with
the rest of the crew, right? The rest of you folks, you

03:09:48.561 --> 03:09:54.569
MATT: make your way to the Mother's Lighthouse.
During the day here, and as you approach, there

03:09:54.623 --> 03:10:02.247
are a few fishermen that come up. There are a
number of small, wooden plates that are weathered

03:10:02.247 --> 03:10:07.841
and dried and cracked in places; they've been left
out for a long time. They'll walk up and place dried

03:10:07.841 --> 03:10:14.706
meat, fish they've caught, sometimes somewhat
ripened and some rotting fruit that have been

03:10:14.706 --> 03:10:22.429
placed there. These appear to be offerings as a
subtle worship to the Wildmother. You are

03:10:22.429 --> 03:10:28.580
familiar with some of these practices, though not
quite as crass, usually, in presentation, but

03:10:28.580 --> 03:10:32.957
it seems to work for travelers that wish for safe
exit from port.

03:10:32.957 --> 03:10:37.048
LAURA: It's really pretty.

03:10:37.048 --> 03:10:39.143
TALIESIN: It's beautiful.

03:10:39.143 --> 03:10:41.248
LAURA: We should go inside.

03:10:41.248 --> 03:10:43.518
SAM: We're going to go inside and talk to Gladys,
yeah?

03:10:43.518 --> 03:10:47.823
LAURA: I wonder if it looks like-- you can still
tell that there's boobs from the inside.

03:10:47.823 --> 03:10:52.826
LIAM: Maybe it's built into the architecture of
the rooms within.

03:10:52.826 --> 03:11:01.253
LAURA: (snickering) Maybe you can sleep in one of
the boobs. Let's go!

03:11:01.253 --> 03:11:03.266
LIAM: Only one way to find out, yeah?

03:11:03.266 --> 03:11:05.009
TALIESIN: I'll find the door.

03:11:05.009 --> 03:11:12.410
MATT: You walk over to the door. It is a
standard, thick, dark wooden door with a small

03:11:12.410 --> 03:11:16.165
slot to look through that is currently closed.

03:11:16.257 --> 03:11:19.053
LAURA: (knocking)

03:11:19.053 --> 03:11:22.380
MATT: You wait about a minute and there's no
response.

03:11:22.380 --> 03:11:24.820
LAURA: (knocking louder)

03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:29.152
MATT: The louder one seems to echo a bit, and
after another minute or so of waiting, you hear

03:11:29.152 --> 03:11:31.035
this faint creaking sound.

03:11:31.035 --> 03:11:35.499
LAURA: It's haunted!

03:11:35.499 --> 03:11:36.882
SAM: It's a robot.

03:11:36.882 --> 03:11:44.259
MATT: It gets louder and louder until eventually,
the small door opens and you see this really

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:51.762
shriveled woman's face. These beady, little, dark
eyes peeking through and goes, "Can I help you?"

03:11:51.762 --> 03:11:53.588
TALIESIN: Are you Gladys?

03:11:53.588 --> 03:11:56.638
MATT: "I am."

03:11:56.638 --> 03:12:08.143
TALIESIN: I think we're supposed to talk. My
name's Caduceus. Mother sent me.

03:12:08.143 --> 03:12:15.068
MATT: Make a persuasion check. With advantage.

03:12:15.068 --> 03:12:20.340
TRAVIS: He's a damn serial killer, I knew it.
Calm motherfucker.

03:12:20.404 --> 03:12:22.682
MARISHA: Mother sent me.

03:12:22.682 --> 03:12:27.551
TALIESIN: That's not terrible. 12.

03:12:27.551 --> 03:12:38.973
MATT: She peeks in and looks at you. "And may the
grace of Melora bring us to talk," and it closes

03:12:39.054 --> 03:12:52.424
and you hear (locks clicking). It creaks open, and for
as high as the slip was, the woman's head's about

03:12:52.541 --> 03:12:58.918
two feet lower than where it was. There's a
stepping stool that's attached to the back

03:12:58.950 --> 03:13:05.555
of the door as it opens up slightly, and she
escorts you in slightly and the woman you see--

03:13:05.555 --> 03:13:17.879
If you can imagine a more burly, after working
physically every day, Estelle Getty. A little wider.

03:13:17.879 --> 03:13:24.730
She has no sleeves on this long working dress
and leather apron or uniform that she wears.

03:13:24.743 --> 03:13:29.162
Her arms, while the skin itself is sagging and
wrinkled, there are some guns on this

03:13:29.251 --> 03:13:35.680
old woman. Her hair is a tuft of tightly curled
white hair. No glasses, just the beady, little,

03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:41.523
dark eyes. Where she smiles, the wrinkles cause
this butterfly effect across the rest of her face.

03:13:41.523 --> 03:13:43.948
LIAM: And human?

03:13:43.948 --> 03:13:52.469
MATT: Human, yes. "So you invoked the Mother. I
assume you are also a follower of hers?"

03:13:52.469 --> 03:14:03.624
TALIESIN: I am, I am. This is a long and
complicated story, I suppose. We've been holding

03:14:03.624 --> 03:14:13.502
the north against something dark. Something
threatens our small temple. Have you ever been to

03:14:13.502 --> 03:14:16.519
the Blooming Grove before?

03:14:16.603 --> 03:14:20.078
MATT: "I cannot say that I have, my apologies."

03:14:20.078 --> 03:14:25.151
TALIESIN: It's quite all right. This has been the
first sign of the Mother I've seen since leaving

03:14:25.151 --> 03:14:26.736
my home.

03:14:26.736 --> 03:14:32.287
MATT: "Well, I'm happy that she could be a beacon
to you as she's been to so many who have

03:14:32.287 --> 03:14:34.849
"passed through Nicodranas."

03:14:34.912 --> 03:14:37.649
LAURA: She's a really big beacon.

03:14:37.649 --> 03:14:49.836
TALIESIN: Her temple is under threat up north. I
was waiting for a sign and I think this is the sign.

03:14:49.836 --> 03:14:59.962
MATT: "Perhaps her guidance is going to be very
useful to you in seeking out a way to cleanse this

03:14:59.962 --> 03:15:01.825
temple you speak of."

03:15:01.825 --> 03:15:10.656
TALIESIN: Yes. I'm so sorry, how rude, my friends
and I-- it's only fitting. Is there any service

03:15:10.656 --> 03:15:15.493
that we can provide for you, for your graciousness
in allowing us into your lighthouse?

03:15:15.493 --> 03:15:26.178
MATT: "I cannot guarantee entry to the top at
least--" and peeks around behind to the rest of you.

03:15:26.209 --> 03:15:28.334
SAM and LAURA: Hi.

03:15:28.334 --> 03:15:30.336
MATT: "Hello."

03:15:30.336 --> 03:15:31.565
LIAM: <i>Hallo</i>.

03:15:31.565 --> 03:15:33.323
LAURA: Do you sleep in the boob?

03:15:33.323 --> 03:15:41.995
MATT: "No."

03:15:41.995 --> 03:15:44.785
TRAVIS: The triple blink afterwards.

03:15:44.835 --> 03:15:50.876
MATT: "I don't know if I can be of much help to
you. I am but a simple mistress of the tower, but--"

03:15:50.876 --> 03:15:57.256
TALIESIN: I feel that there is wisdom here. Would it
be possible to learn more about this place, possibly?

03:15:57.256 --> 03:16:01.002
MATT: "I can tell you of its history. Come in."

03:16:01.002 --> 03:16:02.501
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:16:02.501 --> 03:16:06.554
SAM: All of us? Noisy out here.

03:16:06.554 --> 03:16:08.552
MATT: "Sure."

03:16:08.552 --> 03:16:11.032
MARISHA: So many horses on this lighthouse!

03:16:11.032 --> 03:16:18.762
MATT: Yep. Kept trying to find the right audio
file, and now this kept coming up real busy!

03:16:18.762 --> 03:16:24.509
TRAVIS: We shoot horses outside, just on
Tuesdays!

03:16:24.509 --> 03:16:36.358
MATT: It's a really busy wharf, guys. Anyway. Fuck
me for trying to add atmosphere, right?

03:16:36.358 --> 03:16:40.442
LIAM: He's juggling a lot of plates.

03:16:40.442 --> 03:16:42.195
SAM: We know!

03:16:42.195 --> 03:16:43.509
MATT: I know.

03:16:43.509 --> 03:16:46.854
LIAM: Please. Last week I was like, "How does this
shit work? What do I do here?"

03:16:46.856 --> 03:16:59.553
MATT: It's all good. As she lets you all in with a bit
of a grimace, she goes, "All right. This is the lighthouse."

03:16:59.854 --> 03:17:01.655
LAURA: It's really nice.

03:17:01.655 --> 03:17:08.969
MATT: "It is of the Mother. Melora looks over
those ships at sea. Keeps them safe."

03:17:08.969 --> 03:17:12.967
SAM: Not just the ships at sea, but farmers as
well, right?

03:17:12.967 --> 03:17:18.359
MATT: "Probably. But the lighthouse mainly helps
the sea."

03:17:18.359 --> 03:17:19.862
SAM: Sure.

03:17:19.862 --> 03:17:23.924
LAURA: So this is kind of like a temple then?

03:17:23.924 --> 03:17:25.888
MATT: "More or less."

03:17:26.009 --> 03:17:28.612
LIAM: How long have you been presiding over it?

03:17:28.612 --> 03:17:36.311
MATT: "I have been here for the entirety of my
life, for now 86 years in Nicodranas."

03:17:36.331 --> 03:17:38.419
LIAM: That is respectable.

03:17:38.419 --> 03:17:40.207
LAURA: You climb all these stairs all the time?

03:17:40.207 --> 03:17:48.255
MATT: "Yes. That's how I've gotten to this age and
still as spry as ever." Starts walking up the

03:17:48.255 --> 03:17:52.038
first set of stairs. "Come! You should see the
view."

03:17:52.038 --> 03:17:53.790
TALIESIN: I'm very excited.

03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:56.177
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I love her.

03:17:56.177 --> 03:18:03.657
SAM: As we walk: I know this was our way in or
whatever, but we've got to cut to the chase at

03:18:03.657 --> 03:18:05.565
some point, right?

03:18:05.587 --> 03:18:07.150
TALIESIN: What chase?

03:18:07.150 --> 03:18:11.040
SAM: There's been a lot of fore-pony, but we need
to get to the actual--

03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:15.540
(laughter)

03:18:15.540 --> 03:18:18.513
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking callback. Amazing.

03:18:18.599 --> 03:18:20.750
LAURA: What are we supposed to ask about?

03:18:20.750 --> 03:18:25.099
SAM: About the guy, about Al Gore Dyomin.

03:18:25.126 --> 03:18:26.789
TALIESIN: We'll get there.

03:18:26.789 --> 03:18:28.465
MARISHA: We should call him Al Gore!

03:18:28.465 --> 03:18:31.720
SAM: Al Gore! He invented the Internet!

03:18:31.720 --> 03:18:34.205
TALIESIN: It's an inconvenient moment right now.

03:18:34.205 --> 03:18:36.576
TRAVIS: Fuck your character names.

03:18:36.576 --> 03:18:39.059
MATT: Every time you do, it just adds more hit
points.

03:18:39.059 --> 03:18:43.643
(laughter)

03:18:43.643 --> 03:18:46.085
TALIESIN: We're having a moment right now.

03:18:46.085 --> 03:18:51.071
LIAM: Oh man. You just triple lutzed over Purvan
and flew beyond.

03:18:51.071 --> 03:18:53.533
TRAVIS: So good.

03:18:53.533 --> 03:18:58.400
SAM: But we need to ask about the guy that we came
to ask about. So wrap up the god stuff.

03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:07.907
MATT: "So here in this tower, the Lady looks over
us. Those who wish to have her guidance to prevent

03:19:07.907 --> 03:19:17.410
"dangerous storms at sea or the draw of the tide
to bring them to the depths, are wise to leave for

03:19:17.410 --> 03:19:27.022
"her some gift before they traverse on their
journey. You will see here is the viewing window.

03:19:27.022 --> 03:19:33.122
"'Tis not for sleeping, and it is not the Mother's
boob."

03:19:33.144 --> 03:19:35.912
LAURA: Oh, it's her eyeballs.

03:19:35.912 --> 03:19:43.001
MATT: You glance up, and you can see now there is
a window that's set right about where the clavicle is.

03:19:43.021 --> 03:19:44.783
LAURA: Just kidding, it's where her clavicle is.

03:19:44.783 --> 03:19:46.751
LIAM: So it's past the boob.

03:19:46.751 --> 03:19:50.965
MATT: It's a beautiful view of the entire harbor,
especially this time of day when the sun's at its

03:19:50.965 --> 03:19:57.855
peak. You see this beautiful set of ships out
there and fishing vessels and galleons and a

03:19:57.855 --> 03:20:05.193
handful of different designs to each, different
make from all over the world. There's one that

03:20:05.193 --> 03:20:12.814
appears to be of Marquesian make. You can even see
through the very clear ocean waters here, you can

03:20:12.814 --> 03:20:17.703
see shapes far below the waves from this view as
well. You can see elements of a reef in the

03:20:17.703 --> 03:20:24.851
distance. You can see a few broken and long
silt-covered remnants of ships that had sunk in

03:20:24.851 --> 03:20:36.851
this harbor from long ago. It's breathtaking in a
way you weren't expecting. "You can keep gawking,

03:20:36.851 --> 03:20:40.606
"if that is your preference, but the lighthouse is
up top. Follow me."

03:20:40.606 --> 03:20:43.175
TALIESIN: Exciting.

03:20:43.175 --> 03:20:47.053
MATT: To the top floor, you have the view of
<i>everything</i> around you, not just that front view

03:20:47.053 --> 03:20:56.203
of the harbor, but this beautiful image of the
ocean and the shoreline and the fields and rolling

03:20:56.203 --> 03:21:03.215
hills that surround Nicodranas, of the Cyrios
Mountains to the north, and then far to the east

03:21:03.215 --> 03:21:11.471
you can see the jungles that then vanish up the
sides of the Ashkeeper Peaks. It's a tremendous

03:21:11.471 --> 03:21:18.027
view, and then the entire city below. It's, once
again, increasingly breathtaking from the one you

03:21:18.027 --> 03:21:23.528
previously had. "This is my home."

03:21:23.528 --> 03:21:26.443
LAURA: This is a really good home.

03:21:26.443 --> 03:21:28.011
TALIESIN: It's beautiful.

03:21:28.011 --> 03:21:30.695
LIAM: It's a lot of steps. I can see why you're in
such good shape, Grandmother.

03:21:30.695 --> 03:21:35.047
MATT: "Damn right. You should keep up, do more
cardio."

03:21:35.047 --> 03:21:38.547
LAURA: You get a lot of visitors here?

03:21:38.547 --> 03:21:40.243
MATT: "No, not really."

03:21:40.243 --> 03:21:43.386
LAURA: Really? But it's so cool inside, why don't
people want to come see you?

03:21:43.386 --> 03:21:46.344
MATT: "Kind of prickly."

03:21:46.344 --> 03:21:48.595
LAURA and MARISHA: No.

03:21:48.595 --> 03:21:52.626
MATT: "No, seriously. If your friend with the pink
hair wasn't here, I wasn't going to let you in."

03:21:52.626 --> 03:21:54.828
SAM: He's a good one.

03:21:54.828 --> 03:21:57.805
TALIESIN: I'm not even looking at the view, I'm
looking at the lighthouse.

03:21:57.805 --> 03:22:05.299
MATT: Now that you've focused on this, there are
no windows to the lighthouse. There's a metal

03:22:05.299 --> 03:22:15.357
structure that holds up the top, this faint
15-by-15 foot dome that marks the ceiling of it.

03:22:15.610 --> 03:22:21.600
Each of these openings between these metal rods
that holds that up are where the light protrudes.

03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:28.866
You can see now the marine layer starting to burn
away in the midday and most of the fog is

03:22:28.866 --> 03:22:39.563
receded towards the horizon, the blue sky having
returned-- you see this rough-cut, quartz-like

03:22:39.563 --> 03:22:45.197
crystal that's about three and a half, four feet in
diameter, that's set in the center of this top floor.

03:22:45.197 --> 03:22:48.461
TALIESIN: I'm going to compare it to mine a little
bit.

03:22:48.461 --> 03:23:01.721
MATT: "It is my responsibility to invoke the
Mother's blessing of the stone and each day, have

03:23:01.721 --> 03:23:04.965
"its light guide the ships back to safe shore."

03:23:04.965 --> 03:23:08.172
TALIESIN: I have my own responsibilities to her as
well.

03:23:08.172 --> 03:23:13.782
MATT: "I can sense. Even looking upon you, I can
smell decay."

03:23:13.782 --> 03:23:26.239
TALIESIN: This place, it's so different. Was it
perhaps a gift from the Lawbearer, long ago?

03:23:26.239 --> 03:23:38.139
MATT: "That is very astute of you. It was at a time
when their temperaments were less in conflict.

03:23:38.139 --> 03:23:47.251
"They two, the union, blessed upon this shore the
gifts of stone that then built this tower."

03:23:47.251 --> 03:23:59.189
TALIESIN: It is beautiful. I will admit we have
many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here.

03:23:59.189 --> 03:24:06.405
I have two favors that I would ask of you, and I
understand if they're not possible.

03:24:06.405 --> 03:24:12.948
MATT: "Well, I can maybe help with one and
probably laugh at the other. So choose carefully."

03:24:12.948 --> 03:24:27.791
TALIESIN: Very fair. We have a friend in town in
need of a good turn, and this good turn-- we have

03:24:27.791 --> 03:24:31.672
a friend who's threatened and we're hoping to
maybe glean some information.

03:24:31.672 --> 03:24:34.033
LAURA: It's my mom.

03:24:34.033 --> 03:24:36.128
TALIESIN: It's my friend's mother.

03:24:36.128 --> 03:24:38.421
LAURA: A mother, so there's your in right there.

03:24:38.421 --> 03:24:41.689
MATT: "Cute."

03:24:41.690 --> 03:24:44.614
TALIESIN: She's having difficulty with somebody.

03:24:44.614 --> 03:24:46.727
SAM: Al Gore Dyomin.

03:24:46.739 --> 03:24:47.959
LAURA: Algar.

03:24:47.959 --> 03:24:49.660
SAM: Algar Dyomin.

03:24:49.660 --> 03:24:52.892
MATT: "I've seen this man around in the streets
below."

03:24:52.892 --> 03:24:57.559
SAM: You've just seen him from above? Have you
ever talked to him or any of his--

03:24:57.559 --> 03:25:02.855
MATT: "No, I don't really talk to people, I look at
them below." She points over to the edge and

03:25:02.855 --> 03:25:10.152
there's actually a spyglass leaning against the edge
She goes, "I see a lot "that goes on in this city."

03:25:10.507 --> 03:25:13.024
TALIESIN: Do you perhaps see the thing beneath the
city?

03:25:13.024 --> 03:25:20.166
MATT: "No. But I know there are things beneath
it."

03:25:20.166 --> 03:25:26.925
TALIESIN: I fear that he may be in contact with
something inappropriate.

03:25:26.925 --> 03:25:29.759
LAURA: Do you see where he goes?

03:25:29.759 --> 03:25:36.182
MATT: "There are a couple of places, I believe."

03:25:36.182 --> 03:25:38.509
LAURA: Do you know where he lives?

03:25:38.509 --> 03:25:40.238
MATT: "I do not know where he lives."

03:25:40.238 --> 03:25:42.010
LAURA: Can I look through your spyglass please?

03:25:42.010 --> 03:25:43.823
SAM: Wait, tell us where--

03:25:43.823 --> 03:25:45.593
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

03:25:45.593 --> 03:25:48.462
LAURA: Easily distracted.

03:25:48.462 --> 03:25:50.429
SAM: It's shiny.

03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:51.510
LAURA: It's shiny.

03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:53.188
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

03:25:53.188 --> 03:25:58.859
LAURA: Aw! Why, though? 11.

03:25:58.904 --> 03:26:04.532
MATT: As you instinctually reach for the
spyglass, she slaps your hand. "No."

03:26:04.869 --> 03:26:06.543
LAURA: Why, though?

03:26:06.543 --> 03:26:11.626
MATT: "Because it is my eye in the sky, not yours.
Insolent child."

03:26:11.626 --> 03:26:13.681
TALIESIN: Keep on target.

03:26:13.681 --> 03:26:20.845
LIAM: But it seemed like you were about to
discuss-- you've seen his pattern in the city,

03:26:20.845 --> 03:26:22.561
where he goes day to day?

03:26:22.561 --> 03:26:33.122
MATT: "Depending. When he disappears to do most
of his work beneath in the Sluice-- something.

03:26:33.122 --> 03:26:38.681
"There are two submerged gates in the harbor."

03:26:38.681 --> 03:26:42.175
LIAM: The Sluice Weave, perhaps you are talking
about?

03:26:42.175 --> 03:26:50.069
MATT: "The Sluice Weave, yes." Not that you'd know
that, technically.

03:26:50.069 --> 03:26:54.087
LIAM: You said Sluice Weave. Oh, they said it? Eh,
shit happens. Forget it.

03:26:54.087 --> 03:26:55.863
MATT: It's fine, it's all good.

03:26:55.863 --> 03:26:57.173
LIAM: Banished from the game!

03:26:57.173 --> 03:26:59.795
MATT: I know. You're done! Caleb is murdered. No.

03:26:59.795 --> 03:27:02.810
TALIESIN: Meta that Sluice, there.

03:27:02.810 --> 03:27:04.465
SAM: (pigeon cooing) Sluice Weave.

03:27:04.465 --> 03:27:06.321
MATT: Metagaming seagull.

03:27:06.321 --> 03:27:11.561
(laughter)

03:27:11.611 --> 03:27:15.546
SAM: I killed like seven of them already.

03:27:15.546 --> 03:27:17.024
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

03:27:17.238 --> 03:27:20.692
SAM: Two submerged gates under the harbor?

03:27:20.692 --> 03:27:34.107
MATT: (sighs) "The harbor has protectors, and has
for many generations, that exist beneath the

03:27:34.107 --> 03:27:46.193
"waters in this city. That is part of how the
Sluice functions. I believe this Algar person you

03:27:46.193 --> 03:27:51.710
"mentioned works in some sort of managerial
position there."

03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:54.889
LAURA: At the Sluice.

03:27:54.889 --> 03:28:01.662
SAM: At the Sluice. So we go there and we can
go down-- do we have to swim to get in there?

03:28:01.756 --> 03:28:07.243
MATT: "Probably need some sort of a small boat or
something. But if you're going to go there and you

03:28:07.243 --> 03:28:11.379
"don't have approval, you'll probably be
arrested."

03:28:11.379 --> 03:28:15.048
LAURA: Oh. I don't want to be arrested.

03:28:15.048 --> 03:28:16.985
TALIESIN: I'm sure we can figure something out.

03:28:16.985 --> 03:28:19.838
MATT: "Are you a goblin?"

03:28:19.838 --> 03:28:22.165
SAM: Do I look like a goblin?

03:28:22.165 --> 03:28:23.397
MATT: "Yes."

03:28:23.397 --> 03:28:26.789
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:28:26.789 --> 03:28:37.350
SAM: I, um-- people have told me that. That I do
look like a goblin. Um. I'm a goblin.

03:28:37.350 --> 03:28:41.793
(laughter)

03:28:41.793 --> 03:28:44.773
MATT: "And you're working with these people?"

03:28:44.773 --> 03:28:48.234
SAM: They looked past my hideous features to--

03:28:48.234 --> 03:28:49.830
LAURA: You're not hideous.

03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:51.532
MATT: "She's pretty hideous."

03:28:51.532 --> 03:28:57.176
LIAM: She is invaluable to us. She is a capable
woman. We need her.

03:28:57.176 --> 03:28:58.968
TALIESIN: She does good work.

03:28:58.968 --> 03:29:03.539
SAM: I may be ugly on the outside, but inside I
am--

03:29:03.539 --> 03:29:09.575
LAURA: You're wonderful and you're beautiful on
the outside, too.

03:29:09.575 --> 03:29:11.680
LIAM: You're hardly ugly on the outside.

03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:16.739
MATT: "Look, it's okay. It is something we have in
common."

03:29:16.739 --> 03:29:18.643
SAM: What do you mean?

03:29:18.643 --> 03:29:23.302
MATT: "What, do you think I've lived alone here my
whole live because I'm a spinster?"

03:29:23.302 --> 03:29:33.391
SAM: Well, I mean-- you seem like a relatively
normal-looking person.

03:29:33.391 --> 03:29:37.425
MATT: (scoffs) "It's okay."

03:29:37.425 --> 03:29:40.510
LAURA: I think you're beautiful.

03:29:40.510 --> 03:29:45.647
LIAM: I think you could snap me like a twig.

03:29:45.647 --> 03:29:48.963
MATT: "I think I could too."

03:29:48.963 --> 03:29:53.355
TALIESIN: I do have my last request, and I'll take
these people out of your hair.

03:29:53.355 --> 03:29:57.389
MATT: "Please. They're beginning to grate on me."

03:29:57.508 --> 03:30:05.521
TALIESIN: I'm looking for a sign of where to go
next. I'm waiting for the Mother to speak. Is

03:30:05.521 --> 03:30:11.901
there a place to sit quietly and find her voice?

03:30:11.901 --> 03:30:15.118
MATT: (laughs)

03:30:15.118 --> 03:30:17.711
LAURA: That's the laughing thing she said.

03:30:17.711 --> 03:30:25.510
TALIESIN: Ah, that's fair. For your trouble. I'm
going to pull out one of my teas.

03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:29.874
MATT: (sniffs) "What is this?"

03:30:29.874 --> 03:30:40.554
TALIESIN: It's blessed from the Mother herself,
from one of the graves of the less scrupulous

03:30:40.554 --> 03:30:49.045
families of the north. Good for muscle tension, I
find. Grew it myself.

03:30:49.045 --> 03:30:55.344
MATT: "This is a very kind gesture, very
thoughtful."

03:30:55.344 --> 03:31:03.181
TALIESIN: You serve the Mother well. It's only
fair that you be rewarded.

03:31:03.181 --> 03:31:06.292
MATT: "You as well. All right, now get out!"

03:31:06.292 --> 03:31:08.879
TALIESIN: Thank you for your time.

03:31:08.879 --> 03:31:12.518
MATT: Sets it down on a little side table, and
quickly pushes you back towards the stairs.

03:31:12.579 --> 03:31:15.945
LAURA: Does she start walking us down the stairs?

03:31:15.945 --> 03:31:17.760
MATT: Yeah, above you.

03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:21.547
LIAM: That was a long walk, though. This is an
awkward goodbye.

03:31:21.547 --> 03:31:23.391
TRAVIS: You're not ganking that telescope.

03:31:23.391 --> 03:31:25.345
LAURA: I'm not trying to gank the telescope.

03:31:25.345 --> 03:31:27.035
TALIESIN: She's trying to get in the boob.

03:31:27.035 --> 03:31:28.700
LAURA: Maybe I am.

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:30.706
MATT: What are you trying to do?

03:31:30.706 --> 03:31:37.678
LAURA: Well, I wanted to-- before she started
ushering us out-- to Invoke Duplicity. And make it

03:31:37.678 --> 03:31:40.964
look like I was in front her but really stay
behind.

03:31:40.964 --> 03:31:43.801
SAM: Oh boy.

03:31:43.801 --> 03:31:46.098
TALIESIN: This is going to end poorly.

03:31:46.098 --> 03:31:48.727
MATT: Make a stealth check.

03:31:48.727 --> 03:31:53.365
LIAM: I was also going to say, as they went down,
that Caleb is going to make a big to-do and start

03:31:53.365 --> 03:31:59.116
saying: You know, we didn't have a chance to talk
about when we're above. I am in the market for

03:31:59.116 --> 03:32:03.465
some books, and I was wondering if you knew of any
bookstores.

03:32:03.658 --> 03:32:06.749
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to give myself the Blessing
of the Trickster.

03:32:06.749 --> 03:32:08.383
MATT: You got to do that beforehand.

03:32:08.383 --> 03:32:09.902
LAURA: Motherfuck.

03:32:09.902 --> 03:32:11.885
SAM: How did it go?

03:32:11.885 --> 03:32:13.532
LIAM: Did you call dibs on the dodeca?

03:32:13.532 --> 03:32:16.577
LAURA: No. Eight. Not stealthy.

03:32:16.577 --> 03:32:21.905
MATT: As you're heading down the stairs, you jump
off to the side in that small alcove where the

03:32:21.905 --> 03:32:28.875
window is. And then a second one of you appears.
She begins to walk past you, then stops and turns

03:32:28.875 --> 03:32:33.205
right and looks right at you and goes, "Are you
going to join your friend of you?"

03:32:33.205 --> 03:32:37.035
(laughter)

03:32:37.035 --> 03:32:43.522
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm coming downstairs.

03:32:43.522 --> 03:32:46.017
MATT: "Good. Go!"

03:32:46.017 --> 03:32:47.539
SAM: Come on, Jessie!

03:32:47.539 --> 03:32:48.849
LAURA: Okay. Shit.

03:32:48.849 --> 03:32:51.588
TRAVIS: I've mastered standing so still.

03:32:51.588 --> 03:32:58.431
LIAM: But you know, a full-on library, or perhaps,
you know, a smutty bookshop even, because you

03:32:58.431 --> 03:33:03.369
never know what you're going to find in there. Or
even a used, a vintage book-- Oh, you're not

03:33:03.369 --> 03:33:08.421
even-- (shouting) Are there any bookstores in the
vicinity of this lighthouse?

03:33:08.421 --> 03:33:11.859
MATT: As she pushes you all, she's not answering
any more questions. She's like, "Out, out, out,

03:33:11.876 --> 03:33:16.805
"out. You, both of you." Her hands pass through
your duplicitous image. She goes, "That's strange.

03:33:16.925 --> 03:33:23.689
"Okay, out. Thank you for the tea, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye."

03:33:23.689 --> 03:33:24.743
LIAM: Yes, but--

03:33:24.743 --> 03:33:27.171
MATT: (door slamming) (locks clicking)

03:33:27.319 --> 03:33:29.852
LAURA: Have you heard of our lord and savior, The
Traveler?

03:33:29.852 --> 03:33:31.465
TALIESIN: I thought she was really nice.

03:33:31.465 --> 03:33:33.196
LAURA: She's pretty cool. I liked her a lot.

03:33:33.233 --> 03:33:36.923
LIAM: I don't think she liked most of us, but
she's pretty cool.

03:33:36.923 --> 03:33:41.443
LAURA: She loved us. We were great. Me and my
duplicate skip away.

03:33:41.443 --> 03:33:45.613
SAM: All right, let's go. Its midday; we got to go
to the Open Quay.

03:33:45.613 --> 03:33:49.478
TALIESIN: Did you mean for that to rhyme, or was
that just--

03:33:49.478 --> 03:33:51.332
SAM: It's been rhyming a lot.

03:33:51.332 --> 03:33:54.218
TALIESIN: It's the first time I got it.

03:33:54.218 --> 03:34:00.214
MATT: Beauregard, what's your passive perception?

03:34:00.214 --> 03:34:04.671
MARISHA: My passive perception? 13.

03:34:04.671 --> 03:34:07.168
MATT: 13?

03:34:07.168 --> 03:34:08.586
MARISHA: 13.

03:34:08.586 --> 03:34:17.165
MATT: Oh, they're down here, actually. Okay, good
to know. All right, you guys eventually meet up.

03:34:17.165 --> 03:34:18.913
LAURA: How long have we been outside now?

03:34:18.913 --> 03:34:26.740
MATT: You guys have been outside probably about
three hours or so, total. Of travel and asking and

03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:29.598
getting questions, I'd say two and a half.

03:34:29.598 --> 03:34:32.390
SAM: Are you keeping your-- just spelling and
spelling and spelling?

03:34:32.390 --> 03:34:36.017
LAURA: I'm doing my Disguise spell and keeping it
up the whole time.

03:34:36.017 --> 03:34:37.419
SAM: Damn.

03:34:37.419 --> 03:34:38.441
MATT: Yeah.

03:34:38.441 --> 03:34:39.828
SAM: We should get you a disguise.

03:34:39.828 --> 03:34:42.866
LAURA: That probably would be smarter than what
I'm doing.

03:34:42.866 --> 03:34:53.699
MATT: You guys eventually gather in the center of
the Open Quay. This is the western side of the

03:34:53.699 --> 03:35:05.297
docks on the city. Whereas the Restless Wharf
seems to be a really busy dockyard that runs a

03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:11.751
very tight ship, and seems to be filled with
elements of cheap entertainment and in that vein,

03:35:11.751 --> 03:35:22.460
the Open Quay, it's a little a little bit smaller.
It seems to be less organized. But in the center

03:35:22.460 --> 03:35:27.644
of it is this one massive tower that looms over
the entire district of this side of the docks.

03:35:27.644 --> 03:35:39.100
It's an emerald stone-- dark green with elements
of light green flecked through it-- spire that

03:35:39.100 --> 03:35:47.019
seems very out of place amongst the rest of the
storage buildings, and the various other small

03:35:47.019 --> 03:35:54.904
homesteads and businesses that fill this entire
area. It seems to be dotted with a number of small

03:35:54.904 --> 03:36:03.532
balconies, and comes to a slight roofed peak that
is like a sharpened point. It's very out of place

03:36:03.532 --> 03:36:07.945
here. You've passed by it a couple times before,
but you haven't really inquired much about it, as

03:36:07.945 --> 03:36:13.786
most of your business here had been on the job, so
you've not really cared to ask or question.

03:36:13.786 --> 03:36:20.302
TRAVIS: I was going to say, as we're walking, can
we snag a passerby and ask what that structure is?

03:36:20.327 --> 03:36:33.708
MATT: Sure, you grab an older fisherman, thinning
hair, very sun-weathered face, is carrying a small

03:36:33.742 --> 03:36:40.035
sack over his shoulder, various supplies and
coiled rope over the other shoulder as he's

03:36:40.338 --> 03:36:43.255
heading off towards the docks. Stops and turns.
"Can I help you?"

03:36:43.255 --> 03:36:51.592
TRAVIS: (raspy voice) Yes, we're new in town and
couldn't help but notice that structure there.

03:36:51.592 --> 03:36:54.995
Very unique. What is it?

03:36:54.995 --> 03:37:01.521
MATT: "That's Tide Peak. That's the tower of Yussa
Errennis, the mage who owns this district."

03:37:01.521 --> 03:37:06.045
TRAVIS: There's a mage that owns this district?

03:37:06.045 --> 03:37:09.710
MATT: "Yes. To the chagrin of the Clovis Concord,
yes."

03:37:09.843 --> 03:37:11.451
MARISHA: The chagrin?

03:37:11.451 --> 03:37:13.603
TRAVIS: They don't get on, do they?

03:37:13.603 --> 03:37:16.232
MATT: "You could say that. I need to get to
work."

03:37:16.232 --> 03:37:18.315
LIAM: Yussa Renis?

03:37:18.315 --> 03:37:21.140
MATT: Yussa, Y-U-S-S-A.

03:37:21.140 --> 03:37:25.713
SAM: Yussa Errenis?

03:37:25.713 --> 03:37:28.558
MATT: Errenis, E-R-R-E-N-I-S.

03:37:28.558 --> 03:37:31.594
LIAM: We got a wizard's tower.

03:37:31.594 --> 03:37:35.232
LAURA: Wizard's tower! Flank up it!

03:37:35.232 --> 03:37:38.773
TALIESIN: That's where you find carpets, I was
about to say, yep.

03:37:38.773 --> 03:37:41.206
LAURA: Lead us to the carpet!

03:37:41.206 --> 03:37:52.020
TRAVIS: Around the Tide Peak, do we see the
Zolezzo, the guards around it? Or is it not as

03:37:52.020 --> 03:37:54.449
guarded as other structures are?

03:37:54.627 --> 03:37:59.193
MATT: There are Zolezzo around the area. They're
still keeping the peace here, but there are no

03:37:59.193 --> 03:38:01.856
Zolezzo guarding the tower.

03:38:01.856 --> 03:38:08.218
TRAVIS: Are we far away? Hundreds of feet? Less?

03:38:08.218 --> 03:38:10.911
MATT: Yeah, a few hundred feet, I would say, from
the tower.

03:38:10.911 --> 03:38:13.626
MARISHA: And it stands out like a sore thumb?

03:38:13.626 --> 03:38:15.167
MATT: Yeah.

03:38:15.167 --> 03:38:19.051
TRAVIS: I'm sure a detour wouldn't hurt us.

03:38:19.051 --> 03:38:21.098
MARISHA: I mean, it's on the way.

03:38:21.098 --> 03:38:22.791
TRAVIS: A closeup. Scenic.

03:38:22.791 --> 03:38:24.062
MARISHA: You know, it's fine, exactly.

03:38:24.062 --> 03:38:28.463
TRAVIS: Let's do it. We'll make a detour to go
closer to that on the way to the Open Quay.

03:38:28.463 --> 03:38:34.089
MATT: Okay. You approach it. The district
distinctly around this tower, the road is very

03:38:34.089 --> 03:38:41.611
wide surrounding it. No buildings are buttressed
against it. It seems to be solitary amongst the

03:38:41.611 --> 03:38:44.042
rest of the constructed buildings here.

03:38:44.042 --> 03:38:46.388
MARISHA: Like people deliberately trying to stay
away from it?

03:38:46.388 --> 03:38:50.889
MATT: The folks that are walking in the streets
nearby tend to walk on the opposite side of the road.

03:38:50.954 --> 03:38:54.058
TRAVIS: No bodies of water, pools, lakes,
decorative?

03:38:54.058 --> 03:39:00.232
MATT: Nope. It's just ground. It's built in the
center of this district, and everything's either

03:39:00.232 --> 03:39:02.119
built or shaped around it.

03:39:02.119 --> 03:39:04.586
MARISHA: Does it look like it's been there for a
really long damn time?

03:39:04.586 --> 03:39:06.926
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:39:06.926 --> 03:39:15.962
MARISHA: 15. Wait, nope, 19. Wrong thing.

03:39:15.962 --> 03:39:25.234
MATT: You get up to the tower and begin to inspect
its build. All the stones here look freshly cut.

03:39:25.234 --> 03:39:31.597
Not a lot of wear and tear, weathering to them.
It's hard to tell how long it's been here. It

03:39:31.597 --> 03:39:36.137
seems like it could've been installed last week,
or 25, 30 years ago.

03:39:36.137 --> 03:39:39.848
TRAVIS: How close did Beau get to investigate
like that?

03:39:39.848 --> 03:39:46.193
MATT: About ten feet before you began to really
make that assessment.

03:39:46.292 --> 03:39:48.549
TRAVIS: I thought he said, "before you started to
melt."

03:39:48.549 --> 03:39:50.063
MARISHA: (sizzling)

03:39:50.166 --> 03:39:55.579
TRAVIS: Weird that they're avoiding the thing.

03:39:55.579 --> 03:39:59.366
MARISHA: I mean, these bricks look so new.

03:39:59.366 --> 03:40:03.714
TRAVIS: And green. Why so different? Can we touch
the outside of it?

03:40:03.714 --> 03:40:06.280
MATT: You go and touch it. It's cold stone.

03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:08.906
TRAVIS: Do you see an entrance?

03:40:08.906 --> 03:40:10.667
MARISHA: Did I see an entrance?

03:40:10.667 --> 03:40:12.075
MATT: Not yet.

03:40:12.075 --> 03:40:13.327
MARISHA: No.

03:40:13.327 --> 03:40:16.438
TRAVIS: Is it a super long-- like a tower?

03:40:16.438 --> 03:40:24.048
MATT: Yeah, it's a tower spire, but the base of
it is probably somewhere between 80 to

03:40:24.048 --> 03:40:26.058
100 feet in diameter.

03:40:26.058 --> 03:40:29.396
TRAVIS: How about we nonchalantly walk by the
entrance to get an idea.

03:40:29.396 --> 03:40:33.048
MARISHA: Okay. Do you want to go that way and I'll
go that way? Meet around? Okay.

03:40:33.051 --> 03:40:36.356
MATT: Okay. You guys run around, meet on the other
side. No entrance.

03:40:36.356 --> 03:40:38.239
MARISHA: The fuck?!

03:40:38.239 --> 03:40:39.527
TRAVIS: I didn't see a door.

03:40:39.527 --> 03:40:40.529
MARISHA: No, me neither.

03:40:40.893 --> 03:40:42.077
TRAVIS: Windows?

03:40:42.077 --> 03:40:46.883
MATT: No windows. There are the balconies, but the
first balcony is maybe 25 feet up.

03:40:46.883 --> 03:40:49.596
SAM: Are there flying carpet ports?

03:40:49.596 --> 03:40:52.027
MARISHA: I know, I keep thinking of Allura's
tower.

03:40:52.027 --> 03:40:55.347
TRAVIS: 25-feet-up balcony, and other balconies
above that?

03:40:55.347 --> 03:41:04.210
MATT: Yeah, they're sporadically cast around it.
At its peak, it's probably about 450 feet tall.

03:41:04.210 --> 03:41:07.420
TRAVIS: Oh shit, it's real tall.

03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:09.601
MATT: Yeah, it's this long spire.

03:41:09.601 --> 03:41:11.497
SAM: Oh, dang.

03:41:11.497 --> 03:41:17.490
TRAVIS: Well, how do you get into a tower with no
doors?

03:41:17.490 --> 03:41:29.576
MARISHA: I'd imagine you fly. Or maybe there's an
underground entrance? Around, go under, and up?

03:41:29.576 --> 03:41:33.112
TRAVIS: Yep. You can't parkour up that wall 25
feet, can you?

03:41:33.112 --> 03:41:35.969
MARISHA: Are you asking me to try?

03:41:35.969 --> 03:41:39.079
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:41:39.079 --> 03:41:40.840
MARISHA: All right, you want to give me a boost?

03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:42.447
TRAVIS: I absolutely would love it.

03:41:42.447 --> 03:41:48.696
MARISHA: Okay, I want to see if I can boost off of
Fjord and maybe get up to this tower. Does it look

03:41:48.696 --> 03:41:50.304
like these are bricks that can--

03:41:50.304 --> 03:41:52.310
TRAVIS: 25 feet is pretty far.

03:41:52.310 --> 03:41:55.909
MARISHA: It's very high. Wait, 25 feet, 45 feet?
25 feet's a lot.

03:41:55.909 --> 03:41:58.413
LIAM: This is the world's largest mimic.

03:41:58.413 --> 03:42:03.259
MATT: No, and to help the visual thing, I said 100
feet wide diameter. That's a bit wide for what I

03:42:03.259 --> 03:42:06.384
was originally thinking. It's about maybe 60 feet.

03:42:06.384 --> 03:42:10.016
MARISHA: In diameter. But can I climb up to the
balcony?

03:42:10.016 --> 03:42:14.823
MATT: That's your estimation from this fore point.
Make an acrobatics check.

03:42:14.823 --> 03:42:18.240
TRAVIS: I'm helping her, I'm giving her the old
(grunting).

03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:20.161
MARISHA: Acrobatics, acrobatics.

03:42:20.161 --> 03:42:22.091
SAM: Broad daylight, scaling a building.

03:42:22.091 --> 03:42:26.009
MARISHA: Yeah, one hundred percent, a terrible
idea. A building that everyone is trying to avoid

03:42:26.009 --> 03:42:29.656
in town. 17.

03:42:29.656 --> 03:42:32.122
MATT: You have advantage because he's helping
you.

03:42:32.122 --> 03:42:35.019
MARISHA: Not that one. Cobalt.

03:42:35.019 --> 03:42:37.086
TRAVIS: Ugh!

03:42:37.086 --> 03:42:38.725
MARISHA: I'll take the 17. I know, it was almost a
20.

03:42:38.725 --> 03:42:46.594
MATT: You run, leap. Fjord catches your foot and
gives you the meager, not very strong lift, but

03:42:46.594 --> 03:42:52.459
something to help. Your first foot hits the wall,
the second one hits, and you get a moment of

03:42:52.459 --> 03:42:59.534
traction. Before you (slipping). You only get maybe
12, 13 feet off the ground before you (impact).

03:42:59.557 --> 03:43:03.445
TRAVIS: I did not catch her.

03:43:03.525 --> 03:43:05.162
MARISHA: Oh, you dived out of the way?

03:43:05.162 --> 03:43:07.078
MATT: Fjord steps back and you (whack).

03:43:07.078 --> 03:43:08.619
MARISHA: Catch me! Ca-- what?!

03:43:08.619 --> 03:43:10.122
LIAM: Goosh.

03:43:10.122 --> 03:43:12.312
MARISHA: My ass bone.

03:43:12.312 --> 03:43:15.512
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I'm not real strong. I thought
you'd make it up.

03:43:15.512 --> 03:43:19.907
MARISHA: I thought I would too! It's really slippy
stone.

03:43:19.907 --> 03:43:21.799
TRAVIS: You're getting damage because of that.

03:43:21.799 --> 03:43:23.477
LIAM: Yeah, 1d6 per ten feet.

03:43:23.477 --> 03:43:25.737
MARISHA: Yeah, I already know this math.

03:43:25.737 --> 03:43:30.428
(laughter)

03:43:30.428 --> 03:43:33.802
MATT: Thankfully, you have slow fall as a monk
ability.

03:43:33.802 --> 03:43:36.397
MARISHA: I do. Which I've never had to use.

03:43:36.397 --> 03:43:40.549
MATT: You would take six points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall.

03:43:40.549 --> 03:43:44.567
MARISHA: But I reduce my damage five times my monk
level, up to 20.

03:43:44.567 --> 03:43:46.335
SAM: Oh, that's all of it.

03:43:46.335 --> 03:43:52.814
MATT: Yeah, monks can fall from very high and
three-point landing and be fine. You still hit

03:43:52.814 --> 03:43:55.641
your tailbone and it still stings a little, but
you don't take any damage.

03:43:55.641 --> 03:43:59.339
TRAVIS: We'll let the others know? Okay, and we'll
go to the Open Quay.

03:43:59.339 --> 03:44:02.206
LAURA: Aren't you supposed to fall gracefully as a
monk, then?

03:44:02.206 --> 03:44:10.709
LIAM: Did you reach up as hard as you could
right before you landed to split that speed?

03:44:10.709 --> 03:44:12.610
Is that how monks work?

03:44:12.610 --> 03:44:15.903
MARISHA: Yes, definitely.

03:44:15.955 --> 03:44:26.897
MATT: You guys round the corner, and you watch
Beau suddenly slam into the ground near the

03:44:26.897 --> 03:44:28.473
central tower.

03:44:28.473 --> 03:44:30.190
SAM: Yep, there's our friends.

03:44:30.190 --> 03:44:31.740
LAURA: Ay, that's Beau.

03:44:31.740 --> 03:44:33.835
SAM: What's going on? Why are you jumping up and
down?

03:44:33.835 --> 03:44:37.122
MARISHA: Oh, I was just doing some one-finger
push-ups.

03:44:37.122 --> 03:44:38.872
TRAVIS: We were trying to get into the tower.
There's no doors.

03:44:38.872 --> 03:44:40.621
LIAM: Why were you trying to get into this tower?

03:44:40.621 --> 03:44:45.131
TRAVIS: Well, I've seen it several times coming
through before. It's called the Tide Peak, but

03:44:45.131 --> 03:44:46.683
there are no doors.

03:44:46.683 --> 03:44:52.897
LIAM: Well okay, I've seen all kinds of places
many times that I didn't try to get into

03:44:52.897 --> 03:44:55.313
immediately. What were you trying to accomplish?

03:44:55.313 --> 03:44:57.177
TRAVIS: Did they have doors?

03:44:57.177 --> 03:45:01.755
LIAM: Sure. So you saw it as a challenge, you saw
it as a mountain to climb?

03:45:01.755 --> 03:45:06.291
TRAVIS: Yeah, everybody seems to be avoiding it,
it sticks out in the general area, and there's no

03:45:06.291 --> 03:45:09.471
doors. I just found it odd. Maybe it's a puzzle?

03:45:09.471 --> 03:45:13.204
MARISHA: Also apparently he's a wizard that has a
beef.

03:45:13.204 --> 03:45:14.876
LAURA: Maybe we can blink into it.

03:45:14.876 --> 03:45:19.441
TRAVIS: Oh, maybe! They said there's a mage
here that presides over this district.

03:45:19.707 --> 03:45:23.307
LIAM: That's interesting. How does it pertain to
what we are trying to do today?

03:45:23.307 --> 03:45:25.519
TRAVIS and LAURA: It doesn't.

03:45:25.519 --> 03:45:29.497
SAM: Thank you for keeping us on task, Caleb.

03:45:29.497 --> 03:45:32.287
TRAVIS: Jester, do you know anything about this
tower?

03:45:32.287 --> 03:45:38.113
SAM: No, but we do know about the Sluice. We heard
about a place called the Sluice.

03:45:38.113 --> 03:45:40.316
TRAVIS: We heard the same!

03:45:40.319 --> 03:45:43.658
SAM: That's where this fellow, Algar, might be.

03:45:43.658 --> 03:45:45.538
MARISHA: The Sluice Weave?

03:45:45.538 --> 03:45:47.543
SAM: No, it was just called the Sluice.

03:45:47.543 --> 03:45:49.954
TRAVIS: Pretty sure it's the Sluice Weave.

03:45:50.013 --> 03:45:51.935
LAURA: It's underwater or something?

03:45:51.935 --> 03:45:53.224
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:45:53.224 --> 03:45:54.736
SAM: Did you find it?

03:45:54.736 --> 03:45:56.049
MARISHA: No, we just heard about it.

03:45:56.049 --> 03:45:57.267
SAM: Let's go find it!

03:45:57.267 --> 03:46:00.099
LAURA: We need to get a boat, but we can't just go
there because we'll be arrested.

03:46:00.216 --> 03:46:01.496
TRAVIS: Why?

03:46:01.496 --> 03:46:03.450
LAURA: Don't know, the old lady said that.

03:46:03.450 --> 03:46:05.171
TRAVIS: Oh, you need an invite?

03:46:05.171 --> 03:46:06.265
LAURA: Yeah.

03:46:06.265 --> 03:46:11.227
SAM: It's a gate that protects the city from bad
underwater creatures or something?

03:46:11.227 --> 03:46:14.750
MARISHA: Well, we heard the whole thing was
underwater. Did you hear that? Like submerged?

03:46:14.750 --> 03:46:16.729
LAURA: Something like that, submerged gates or
something.

03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:18.140
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:46:18.140 --> 03:46:20.162
LIAM: But we don't have to go, we could keep
working on this tower.

03:46:20.174 --> 03:46:25.264
MARISHA: You know, I feel like you're throwing a
lot of shade about us investigating this tower.

03:46:25.308 --> 03:46:27.723
TRAVIS: We were here on time, you know.

03:46:27.723 --> 03:46:30.996
MARISHA: Yeah, we were killing time. It is midday,
we are at the Quay.

03:46:30.996 --> 03:46:32.697
SAM: Beau?

03:46:32.697 --> 03:46:33.666
MARISHA: What?

03:46:33.666 --> 03:46:39.824
SAM: He gets a little picky when he hasn't had a
book in a while. So we just need to find him

03:46:39.824 --> 03:46:41.664
a book and he'll be okay for a bit.

03:46:41.708 --> 03:46:44.219
MARISHA: I mean, you would think the wizard would
be fascinated with the idea of the wizard tower

03:46:44.219 --> 03:46:46.457
that's very mysterious in the middle of the city.

03:46:46.457 --> 03:46:49.527
LIAM: It is very interesting, but I thought we
were helping our friend here.

03:46:49.527 --> 03:46:54.228
MARISHA: Do you have wizard envy? It's okay, it's
a very large tower.

03:46:54.228 --> 03:46:58.528
LIAM: Right, that's an easy thing to go to, so go
to it.

03:46:58.528 --> 03:47:00.477
TRAVIS: Long and rather skinny, so.

03:47:00.477 --> 03:47:02.115
SAM: What did you find?

03:47:02.115 --> 03:47:11.322
TRAVIS: We did find out that Marius LePual-- fuck
that last name. He's sometimes seen at some of the

03:47:11.322 --> 03:47:17.144
taverns around, some of the shadier ones. The Skew
or the Open Quay.

03:47:17.144 --> 03:47:21.475
SAM: Okay, well we're in a shady area, right?

03:47:21.475 --> 03:47:22.921
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:47:22.921 --> 03:47:31.114
SAM: So we're close to Marius LePual. We're also
close to the Sluice, maybe? Is that close to here?

03:47:31.148 --> 03:47:32.701
MARISHA: Is that close to here?

03:47:32.701 --> 03:47:34.461
MATT: You don't really know.

03:47:34.461 --> 03:47:35.993
SAM: Goddamn it!

03:47:35.993 --> 03:47:38.818
MARISHA: Well, let's go into the Quay, we haven't
been in yet, right?

03:47:38.818 --> 03:47:41.300
MATT: Well, the Quay is the district. You're in
the district right now.

03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:43.172
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're in the district, it's like a
wharf.

03:47:43.172 --> 03:47:45.810
MARISHA: Wait, but the Open Quay was a low-life
dive, right?

03:47:45.810 --> 03:47:47.603
SAM: It's a low-life area.

03:47:47.603 --> 03:47:50.026
MARISHA: I thought The Skew was the low-life
area.

03:47:50.046 --> 03:47:53.404
LAURA: No, The Skew is a place where you can
live.

03:47:53.784 --> 03:47:59.548
MATT: Yeah, it's a heavily residential district
for the more affordable and cheaper residents.

03:47:59.548 --> 03:48:02.174
MARISHA: Is the Quay inside The Skew?

03:48:02.174 --> 03:48:03.636
MATT: No.

03:48:03.636 --> 03:48:05.383
TRAVIS: The Meandering Treasurer?

03:48:05.383 --> 03:48:07.443
MATT: The Meandering Treasurer is a shop.

03:48:07.443 --> 03:48:08.883
TRAVIS: Is a shop.

03:48:08.883 --> 03:48:10.550
MARISHA: Is there a bar?

03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:12.475
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:48:12.475 --> 03:48:14.254
SAM: Let's go find a bar.

03:48:14.254 --> 03:48:16.002
LIAM: That's our solution for everything.

03:48:16.002 --> 03:48:18.783
SAM. Yeah. I will aid.

03:48:18.783 --> 03:48:28.029
MARISHA: Okay, please do. Okay okay okay, that's
17 again. Nope, sorry, 15. Keep looking at the

03:48:28.029 --> 03:48:29.814
wrong numbers.

03:48:29.814 --> 03:48:39.804
MATT: If you're looking around the Open Quay,
there are a few people that point you towards The

03:48:39.804 --> 03:48:46.551
Withered Bird Inn, which is an inn and tavern, and
you've probably passed by it before once the

03:48:46.551 --> 03:48:50.098
direction is pointed out, you're like, "Yeah, no
I've been there, it's a little dive-y but it's popular

03:48:50.098 --> 03:48:55.765
"amongst the sailors and folks that come through."
If you're looking for something in the Restless

03:48:55.765 --> 03:49:03.666
Wharf, the only place that really comes to your
attention that's told is The Wayfarer's Cove.

03:49:03.666 --> 03:49:06.435
SAM: We've been told about that place!

03:49:06.435 --> 03:49:07.790
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:10.876
SAM: Yeah, that's where they said Marius LePual
might hang out.

03:49:10.876 --> 03:49:15.867
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wayfarer's Cove is-- is supposed to
be delivered to Marius--

03:49:15.867 --> 03:49:17.420
SAM: That's why!

03:49:17.420 --> 03:49:19.357
TRAVIS and LAURA: We should go there!

03:49:19.357 --> 03:49:20.759
SAM: Let's go there!

03:49:20.759 --> 03:49:22.728
LAURA: We're stupid, we could have gone there
already.

03:49:22.728 --> 03:49:26.412
SAM: But we're not looking for Marius LePual,
we're looking for Al Gore!

03:49:26.743 --> 03:49:28.469
LAURA: Algar.

03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:32.586
SAM: Algar. But we should still go there because
we can maybe kill two birds.

03:49:32.586 --> 03:49:34.181
LAURA: Well, you've already got seven dead birds.

03:49:34.181 --> 03:49:37.545
SAM: I've got seven dead birds.

03:49:37.545 --> 03:49:40.248
MATT: More birds must die!

03:49:40.248 --> 03:49:43.094
TALIESIN: We get nine birds! It's nine.

03:49:43.094 --> 03:49:46.269
TRAVIS: We got to take what's given to us and
right now we don't have an invite to get down to

03:49:46.269 --> 03:49:51.549
the Sluice. So we might as well go by The
Wayfarer's Cove.

03:49:51.549 --> 03:49:55.633
SAM: But we're in the Quay, how far away in The
Wayfarer's Cove?

03:49:55.633 --> 03:49:57.056
LIAM: Oh boy.

03:49:57.056 --> 03:49:59.265
MATT: It's maybe 30 minutes away.

03:49:59.265 --> 03:50:01.335
SAM: 30 fucking minutes.

03:50:01.335 --> 03:50:04.948
TRAVIS: We're going, we're on the way, we're
going. Unless you want to fuck with this tower a

03:50:04.948 --> 03:50:09.921
little bit.The tower is super interesting to me.
It's 400 feet tall, no doors.

03:50:09.921 --> 03:50:12.372
SAM: We'll come back to the tower. We'll go to the
Wayfarer's Cove.

03:50:12.372 --> 03:50:14.544
TRAVIS: Can you climb 25 feet?

03:50:14.544 --> 03:50:18.335
LIAM: We were at a lighthouse that is even taller
than this, you we could go try to climb that, if

03:50:18.335 --> 03:50:20.011
you'd like?

03:50:20.011 --> 03:50:23.291
MARISHA: Okay, once again with the shade towards
trying to climb the tower.

03:50:23.291 --> 03:50:28.344
LIAM; It is open shade, Beauregard, because it has
nothing to do with what we are trying to do today.

03:50:28.344 --> 03:50:34.066
I am not hiding my shade, it is out, I am
providing shade for you. We have something

03:50:34.066 --> 03:50:38.130
to do! Yeah, I am blotting out the sun, we have
shit to do!

03:50:38.145 --> 03:50:40.846
MARISHA: No, you blot out the sun everywhere you
go, Caleb.

03:50:40.846 --> 03:50:42.728
TRAVIS: Ooh, salt.

03:50:42.728 --> 03:50:44.746
MARISHA: Let's go!

03:50:44.746 --> 03:50:51.953
MATT: You make your way out of the Open Quay
towards the Restless Wharf district once more. Fjord.

03:50:51.953 --> 03:50:53.863
TRAVIS: Yes?

03:50:53.863 --> 03:50:58.345
MATT: You keep looking over your shoulder, your
interest towards the Tide Peak tower. It's

03:50:58.345 --> 03:51:06.398
interesting: the further away from it you get, the
shorter it looks, and you begin to understand how

03:51:06.398 --> 03:51:10.848
you didn't notice a 400-foot tower when you first
entered the city or one you've been around before,

03:51:10.848 --> 03:51:16.975
and you've been to this city before. It seems the
further away you walk, the tower seems to visually

03:51:16.975 --> 03:51:21.895
shrink within the city skyline. It's still visible
as a tower, and it's still taller than most of the

03:51:21.895 --> 03:51:25.915
buildings, but as soon as you guys get quite a
ways away, you're like, "That can't be more than

03:51:25.915 --> 03:51:28.981
"maybe 150 feet tall."

03:51:28.981 --> 03:51:32.780
TRAVIS: We are continuing on, but I just want
to point out that the place with no doors

03:51:32.780 --> 03:51:35.158
also fucking shrunk.

03:51:35.158 --> 03:51:40.255
LIAM: Fjord, 100% it is very interesting and I
have checked the box in the back of my brain. I do

03:51:40.255 --> 03:51:43.173
want to understand what that place is--

03:51:43.173 --> 03:51:44.816
TRAVIS: Yeah, it tickles your pickle, doesn't it?

03:51:44.816 --> 03:51:49.196
LIAM: Hmm. I'm curious, but let's shelve it.

03:51:49.196 --> 03:51:52.962
LAURA: Has Yussa ever come to see my mom sing?

03:51:52.962 --> 03:51:54.638
MATT: No.

03:51:54.638 --> 03:52:00.048
TRAVIS: Within, something's up, mm-hmm.

03:52:00.048 --> 03:52:06.222
MARISHA: I mean, this is coming from the guy who
spent two hours in a smut shop trying to find magic.

03:52:06.222 --> 03:52:10.476
LIAM: I know that you're embarrassed for wasting
your time here, but you will get over it.

03:52:10.476 --> 03:52:12.698
LAURA: Let's find the bar, please!

03:52:12.698 --> 03:52:21.145
SAM: Guys! Look at this cute puppy. Look at this
adorable puppy. It's such a cutie pie!

03:52:21.145 --> 03:52:22.299
TRAVIS: Make it do the thing.

03:52:22.299 --> 03:52:23.595
SAM: Make it blink.

03:52:23.622 --> 03:52:25.741
LAURA: Poof!

03:52:25.741 --> 03:52:31.578
MATT: It vanishes, and then you hear (poof) and
you look over your shoulder. One of the small

03:52:31.578 --> 03:52:39.984
tables on the side of one of the various warehouses
that contained a bucket that had a bunch of tools

03:52:39.984 --> 03:52:45.141
and various repair materials for ships has been
knocked over, and the puppy's tumbling out of it.

03:52:45.684 --> 03:52:47.683
LAURA: Oh! Poof!

03:52:47.683 --> 03:52:49.698
SAM: We have to go save our puppy, come on!

03:52:49.698 --> 03:52:51.602
MATT: Runs up to you and jumps back into your
arms.

03:52:51.602 --> 03:52:54.468
LAURA: That was so close, that was really close to
us that time!

03:52:54.468 --> 03:52:56.558
SAM: Aww, it's so cute. Right, guys?

03:52:56.558 --> 03:53:00.108
LIAM: That's what I really want. You know how
little puppies, they crash into things when they're

03:53:00.108 --> 03:53:02.170
they're walking? Every time he poofs out, I just
want--

03:53:02.170 --> 03:53:04.273
MATT: That's basically what he is.

03:53:04.273 --> 03:53:06.388
MARISHA: He's a fainting blink dog.

03:53:06.388 --> 03:53:10.279
SAM: He's cute though, right?

03:53:10.279 --> 03:53:12.340
MATT: Puppies are useless at this age, man.

03:53:12.340 --> 03:53:18.110
SAM: I'm just saying he's cute, so let's be
friends again and let's just keep going.

03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:28.613
MATT: Finishing the rest of your jaunt here as
Fjord is making equations in the air in front of

03:53:28.662 --> 03:53:33.616
him, you eventually make your way, by asking a few
more questions, towards the Wayfarer's Cove. As

03:53:33.616 --> 03:53:40.894
you approach this dark looking dive, that is
probably furthest of all the other bars or taverns

03:53:40.894 --> 03:53:49.523
you've seen here out towards the docks itself. The
super dark wood that it's constructed of makes it

03:53:49.523 --> 03:53:56.756
look almost like a blighted barnacle on the rest
of this wharf area. As you approach the exterior,

03:53:56.756 --> 03:54:02.849
you can see a large piece of driftwood that
probably belonged to a ship long before that had

03:54:02.849 --> 03:54:09.466
either fallen in the ocean or, after its final
voyage, was pulled apart and then elements of it

03:54:09.466 --> 03:54:15.581
were used to either build or embellish on the
structure. It looks like the kind of bar that was

03:54:15.581 --> 03:54:18.430
salvaged, or was built from salvage.

03:54:18.430 --> 03:54:21.500
MARISHA: (whispers) Rad. I know, so cool!

03:54:21.500 --> 03:54:27.517
MATT: As you step through the entry way, the
door's open, slightly ajar, you pull it open. The

03:54:27.517 --> 03:54:32.765
interior has no music, there is just whispers and
conversation. The smell hits you immediately, the

03:54:32.765 --> 03:54:41.101
smell is a combination of mossy musk from wood
that has been soaked with seawater and then left

03:54:41.101 --> 03:54:45.102
to dry hundreds of times over, as well as the
various forms of liquor and ale that have been

03:54:45.102 --> 03:54:54.013
spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies,
and a lot unwashed sailor scent.

03:54:54.013 --> 03:54:55.479
LAURA: Ugh.

03:54:55.479 --> 03:55:01.689
MATT: Yeah, the odor in here is not pleasant,
definitely that of the working man or woman who

03:55:01.689 --> 03:55:10.825
comes in from the sea. Glancing inside, there is a
bar to the immediate left, where there is a rather

03:55:10.825 --> 03:55:22.472
crotchety looking fellow, half-elf, who is heavily
scarred on one side of his face. A bit heavy set

03:55:22.472 --> 03:55:30.279
for a half-elf. For the elven lineage, it's rare
to see someone who has not displayed the more

03:55:30.279 --> 03:55:35.698
lithe side of the blood line, but this elf has
either worked hard to fight that side of their

03:55:35.698 --> 03:55:43.206
bloodline, and has a bit of a paunch and a bit of
a soft chin and jawline. He looks over to you and

03:55:43.206 --> 03:55:54.265
nods. He goes, "Let me know if you need a drink,
or something." Spits off to the side. Looking

03:55:54.265 --> 03:55:59.182
inside, glancing about the small number of patrons
here, there's only five of them at the bar this

03:55:59.182 --> 03:56:06.180
time of day. You see one really old, salty looking
sailor who has this heavy cap pulled down over his

03:56:06.180 --> 03:56:11.498
ears to the point where he has these bushy white
eyebrows that poof underneath where the fold of it

03:56:11.498 --> 03:56:18.428
brims upward, and has this big puffed chinstrap
beard around the side. His lips are pressed up to

03:56:18.428 --> 03:56:23.294
where you can tell he probably has no teeth, so
his jaw can press all the way up towards the roof

03:56:23.294 --> 03:56:28.742
of his mouth, and he's sitting there with a large,
dark green bottle of some sort of beer or ale and

03:56:28.742 --> 03:56:36.695
is just staring forward, chewing quietly. Off to
the right hand side you see, for some of you the

03:56:36.695 --> 03:56:49.575
first time, what looks to be a very, very large
humanoid turtle. You see them sitting on a bench.

03:56:49.575 --> 03:56:54.173
You've seen a few tortles in your travels, but
they don't normally travel northward into the

03:56:54.173 --> 03:57:01.626
Empire. This one is sitting there, hunched over a
table by themself with a heavy tankard that

03:57:01.626 --> 03:57:08.017
they're clutching with both of their hands. You
see bits of rope that are tied across in a lattice

03:57:08.017 --> 03:57:16.822
over elements of the shell, and on the right side
of the shell, you see emerging three pipes or

03:57:16.822 --> 03:57:21.362
horns of some kind that are either carved or
embedded on the right side of the shell. It looks

03:57:21.362 --> 03:57:26.709
like three exhaust pipes, if you will, but they're
made from some sort of ivory-type material. They

03:57:26.709 --> 03:57:36.327
look chipped a little bit, and worn. As it turns
back, its extended head and a snapjaw type nose,

03:57:36.327 --> 03:57:45.543
curves back and you see an eye patch over the
right eye, and just grins. You see these series of

03:57:45.543 --> 03:57:50.779
tattoos up each arm that look like swirling water,
that curl into themselves and end right at the

03:57:50.779 --> 03:57:56.782
forearm. It goes back to its drink and sips a bit
from it. You see another patron in the far back is

03:57:56.782 --> 03:58:11.025
a woman with weathered, dark-brown skin.
The hair itself is this tattered wild mass of

03:58:11.094 --> 03:58:20.671
curled and crimped hair that's graying heavily
towards the tips. She has a long, light brown coat

03:58:20.671 --> 03:58:26.354
made of leather-like material that probably hangs
down to the floor from where she's sitting, and

03:58:26.354 --> 03:58:32.865
where her calf-high boots are visible from under
the side. She's sitting across from somebody who's

03:58:32.865 --> 03:58:43.699
dressed as a ready-to-action shipmate. They have a
basic billowing shirt that is opened down to the

03:58:43.699 --> 03:58:51.207
mid chest. They have a ruddier complexion,
probably sunburned over and over again to the

03:58:51.207 --> 03:58:55.774
point where now it just looks like they're
perpetually sunburned. He looks younger, probably

03:58:55.774 --> 03:59:02.224
in his 20s, the woman looks maybe in her mid to
late 40s or so. Both human, and they both glance

03:59:02.224 --> 03:59:09.957
over as you enter the dark interior, contrasted by
the very bright light that silhouettes your

03:59:09.957 --> 03:59:15.817
figures as you step within The Wayfarer's Cove.
And that's where we're going to pick up next week.

03:59:15.921 --> 03:59:19.209
LAURA: Fuck! So awesome!

03:59:19.209 --> 03:59:20.957
MARISHA: It was so awesome!

03:59:20.966 --> 03:59:22.422
TALIESIN: I like turtles.

03:59:22.422 --> 03:59:24.008
MARISHA: The tower!

03:59:24.045 --> 03:59:25.708
LAURA: Everybody was so cool in there!

03:59:25.708 --> 03:59:27.323
LIAM: I like turtles.

03:59:27.323 --> 03:59:28.745
MATT: It's a weird place!

03:59:28.745 --> 03:59:30.740
SAM: Your home city is cool.

03:59:30.740 --> 03:59:33.038
LAURA: I know, right?

03:59:33.038 --> 03:59:34.620
SAM: Did you invent it?

03:59:34.620 --> 03:59:36.735
LAURA: I made up everything in that city, guys.

bartender, the tortle with tattoos, the redheaded

03:59:43.663 --> 03:59:46.204
human woman and then she was with a man?

03:59:46.204 --> 03:59:49.054

03:59:55.646 --> 03:59:59.199

a gray-white at the tips. It's this mane of hair.

03:59:59.199 --> 04:00:03.131

04:00:03.131 --> 04:00:08.702
