NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.995
[cell phone dinging]

00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:08.464
MARISHA and MATT: Eyy!

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:09.985
MATT: It's working again!

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:11.902
MARISHA: It's working again, sort of!

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:13.933
MATT: For the time being.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:20.085
MARISHA: For the time being. See if his phone
makes any amount of difference. Is this light

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.335
blinding you?

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.773
MATT: No!

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:30.154
MARISHA: Is it bad? Would this be better? Let's
see here. Oh, that's a little bit better. We're

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:31.514
kind of rim lit.

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:32.893
MATT: To make it more--

00:00:32.893 --> 00:00:35.915
MARISHA: It's kind of nice, it's more cinematic
this way.

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:38.094
MATT: Sure, we'll go with that!

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:44.155
MARISHA: I don't look as washed out, either, when
we use the light from behind as well.

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:45.833
MATT: You're fine.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:52.105
MARISHA: Hi, guys. How are you doing? So it got
dark in the time that we went through Bakersfield

00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:53.763
and Coalinga.

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:56.325
MATT: No, I think we're just now hitting Coalinga.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:01.387
MARISHA: Oh my god, you're right! And it just
started smelling bad right as we said that!

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:03.747
MATT: Yeah, you summoned it. This is your fault.

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:05.046
MARISHA: I summoned it!

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:06.547
MATT: Oh, it's so bad!

00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:09.054
MARISHA: It's so bad.

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:12.175
MATT: You might want to explain to people out
there what that means.

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:20.806
MARISHA: There's this part-- oof. Ooh, it's bad.
There's this part on the 5 when you're driving up

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:34.065
north through California-- oof-- and the name of
the town is Cow-alinga, spelled like C-O-A-L-I-N-G-A.

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:35.434
MATT: Coalinga, technically.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:43.373
MARISHA: Coalinga, yeah. Coalinga. But everyone
calls it Cow-alinga because there's a bunch of

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.996
dairy farms.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:47.308
MATT: Slaughterhouses. Lot of cows.

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:51.105
MARISHA: The entire town just smells like--

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:52.412
MATT: The worst.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.854
MARISHA: Cow shit. Yeah, it just smells like the
worst and we're hitting it.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:02:01.655
MATT: Not just cow shit. Cow shit mixed with the
physical embodiment of death. I don't know, it's a

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.455
terrible place.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:12.155
MARISHA: Yeah. That's a really good way of putting
it, I guess. Sure. So, yeah, we're going through

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:14.374
Coalinga right now, so that's fun.

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:15.853
MATT: Indeed.

00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:20.654
MARISHA: Someone asked how Fallout 4 was going,
actually, and we were actually just talking--

00:02:20.654 --> 00:02:22.205
MATT: (evil laughter)

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:27.154
MARISHA: We were just talking a minute ago about
how we've reached that point, like we did in Skyrim,

00:02:27.154 --> 00:02:37.704
where you start to see the world through a filter.
Aw, your mom just texted you. She said that they

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:38.936
love you.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.436
MATT: Aw! I'll call them later on.

00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:52.915
MARISHA: Yeah. As we've been driving, we'll see
things and be like, "Oh, look! That looks like a

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.364
"great place for a settlement. That would be
awesome."

00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:59.835
MATT: Or, "I want to go explore that abandoned
building." No, that's a bad idea. I should not do

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:01.333
that. I'll get stabbed.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.393
MARISHA: But it looks exciting.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:09.076
MATT: Yeah. Skyrim was particularly bad because
you were so used to picking all the herbs and

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:13.684
flowers everywhere that whenever you'd be driving
somewhere, you'd see a nice little patch of flowers.

00:03:13.684 --> 00:03:15.912
You'd be like, "Gather!"

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.520
MARISHA: Oh, harvest! Harvest, harvest, harvest!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.951
MATT: It's bad.

00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.691
MARISHA: Here, you see trash on the side of the
road. I wonder if Fallout will spark--

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:25.991
MATT: A generation of hoarders?

00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.352
MARISHA: Aw, I was going to say a new generation
of people who go around cleaning trash off the

00:03:30.352 --> 00:03:31.602
side of the road.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.191
MATT: Both. I would love that. I would love to see
a lot of people starting their own junk-built

00:03:37.191 --> 00:03:40.101
settlements after this. It becomes like East
Jesus.

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:43.470
MARISHA: Everything's recycled. Yeah.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.012
MATT: Pretty fantastic.

00:03:45.012 --> 00:03:48.421
MARISHA: We might be losing service again. It's
getting a little spotty, it looks like.

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:56.291
MATT: This may be folly if this fails, folks.
We're trying our best. As long as we have some

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.753
number manipulation, that's good, but if you have
any questions--!

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:08.631
MARISHA: It's okay. You drive, I'll look at it.
Man, we're trying so hard. Look, there it goes!

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:23.052
Hang in there, connection! Yeah, totally. Yes. But
yeah, no, I keep seeing power lines and abandoned

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:28.502
sheds and I'm like, "Ah, Fallout!"

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:32.142
MATT: It's good. It's a good game.

00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:36.710
MARISHA: But if we lose you guys, we're sorry!
