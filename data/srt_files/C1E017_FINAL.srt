00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:05,820
MATT: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role.
After a two-week hiatus of our usual gaming

2
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:11,880
schedule at Comic Con and then a fun-filled crazy
week with half the party playing games and having

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,510
fun while me and Marisha were in New Zealand,
we're happy to be back. We're happy you guys are

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,762
here as we continue our adventure going forward.
We'll have a lot of really cool things to announce

5
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:25,643
here in a moment, but let's go ahead and get that
intro video started.

6
00:00:25,643 --> 00:01:31,889
[dramatic music]

7
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:39,261
MATT: Welcome back. All right, this is Critical
Role: a show where a bunch of voice actors play

8
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:43,649
Dungeons and Dragons. Fun crazy nerds rolling dice
and good times. With the adventures of Vox

9
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:51,548
Machina. You're doing all right Travis. Couple
quick things: Me and Marisha wanted to say a quick

10
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:56,233
shout out to all of our Critters who came to visit
us in Wellington, New Zealand at Armageddon Expo.

11
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:02,461
We had a strong showing of Critters that was
really amazing from across the world. And

12
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:06,191
Australia. People could fly over from Australia
just to get us to sign their books, so there's a

13
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:09,022
lot of really awesome fan love out there. So you
guys are great.

14
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:13,289
MARISHA: Maybe next time all of us could go? You
guys should tell them.

15
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:19,693
MATT: Oh man, a Down Under Kiwi trip for all
Critical Role would be a lot of fun. Send your

16
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:22,381
local-- I guess you don't have a congressman,
because you're a different country.

17
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,069
ORION: Your "Con-gressman."

18
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,021
MATT: Oh there you go. Orion saved it. Thank you.

19
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,352
ORION: It was there the whole time, Matt.

20
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:30,646
(laughter)

21
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:38,645
MATT: Disadvantage. All right, so first and
foremost, couple things I want to get up here. We

22
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:45,551
had our sub giveaways this evening. For every 50
subs, we give away a signed player's handbook by

23
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:49,657
the cast of Critical Role, a signed photo of the
cast. And tonight especially we're also giving

24
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:54,865
away in that package Espionage nail packs,
specifically with our fantastic gamer dice on the

25
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:59,179
tips. Espionage Cosmetics were gracious to give
these to us, and we will give them to you.

26
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,592
Every 50 subs.

27
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:08,045
MARISHA: Awesome. Go follow them on Twitter; I
think they're @espionagemakeup. Just look it up.

28
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,487
They're awesome.

29
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:12,597
MATT: Google it. However, we already have a
winner, before the show started. That's

30
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:17,636
explodingiggy. So congratulations to
explodingiggy. You already got one more to come.

31
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:24,480
The fun and interesting challenge for this evening
as we've been made aware, you guys, being the

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,707
ridiculously amazing people you are. One of you
crafted a challenge for yourself. That if we can

33
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:39,242
manage to somehow get to 5,000 subscribers before
the end of the show tonight, they will create and

34
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:45,133
send an eight-foot Trinket. Like eight-foot-tall
Trinket bear.

35
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,362
MARISHA: Yeah which is vague. A little. What's it
made out of?

36
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,429
ZAC: It's a teddy bear. It's a giant teddy bear.

37
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:56,857
LAURA: And maybe his little paws can be on my
shoulder the whole time I play?

38
00:03:56,857 --> 00:04:01,864
MATT: Oh, he would be a perpetual staple of the
set. That would be behind you at all times.

39
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:04,656
ZAC: Cool, not difficult at all, guys! Totally not
difficult at all!

40
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:07,880
MARISHA: Yes, but we have to get to 5,000
subscribers.

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,246
TALIESIN: Trojan horse and a suit that they wear.
They could sneak themselves

42
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,251
onto the stage that way.

43
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:17,399
MATT: I'll get inside the teddy bear, and I'll act
out Trinket during the game. Perfect. That's not

44
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,809
going to happen. It might happen. That's if we hit
5000 subscribers, so all your friends you know

45
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:27,758
that watch the show who don't subscribe yet, tell
them to. If you know anyone that hasn't seen the

46
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:31,908
show yet, get them on, because a giant eight-foot
bear would be pretty much the

47
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,334
most ridiculous thing ever.

48
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:36,206
MARISHA: Yeah, I already tweeted #8ftTrinket.

49
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:41,347
LAURA: I saw something subs for bears.

50
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:45,955
ORION: Nope. Bad idea.

51
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:50,541
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, subs for bears is a whole
section of Craigslist you don't want to go to. Or

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:58,328
you do, if that's your thing. All right, so. Happy
to be back from Comic Con. We had a great panel

53
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:03,585
and great turnout there. Thank you for those who came and
those who watched the panel. If you haven't seen

54
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:08,265
it yet, the panel is available on the Geek and
Sundry website. You can watch it. And as we all

55
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,064
know, last episode we said goodbye temporarily to
our fantastic gnome cleric, Pike. She's off in New

56
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,198
York shooting awesome television shows, but she's
here in spirit.

57
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,476
LIAM: It's going to be great.

58
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,285
LAURA: It's going to be a good show.

59
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:32,102
MATT: Also, as a reminder, our charity that we run
here for the show is to 826LA. 826LA is a

60
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:37,940
fantastic charity that promotes and teaches
creative writing to younger kids between the ages

61
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,444
of 8 and 16, I think it was. Somewhere in that
range?

62
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:41,640
MARISHA: K through High School.

63
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,970
MATT: K through High School. Fantastic program,
and anything you can do to help is much

64
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:52,577
appreciated and awesome. And, Marisha, if you want
to go ahead and take this away. We have a new

65
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:55,233
addition to our set coming next week.

66
00:05:55,233 --> 00:06:02,239
MARISHA: It's so awesome! I had the absolute
pleasure of joining Felicia on the latest episode

67
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,166
of The Flog. Go check it out. It's back. I love
that show. She wanted to make a neon sign, and she

68
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:14,719
was like, "Let's do a Critical Role sign." Because
she's a fan of our show, which is awesome. She's

69
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:23,523
probably watching right now. Love you, Felicia. So
this was it, unfortunately. Yes, are we ready to

70
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:27,827
do the honors? Ready? For Vox Machina!

71
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:32,567
(cheering)

72
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:38,892
MARISHA: So yeah, that's probably going to be up
on our set next week, blessing us with its

73
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:47,990
rose-colored glow. Go watch, if you want to see
how we made it. We got this awesome tutorial. It's

74
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,219
cool. You can go and learn how to make neon signs
yourself.

75
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,787
ORION: And it's all science-y too.

76
00:06:52,787 --> 00:07:05,307
MARISHA: It's all science-y. It's totally nerdy
awesome. Yeah, krypton. But yes. Here we go. All

77
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,209
right, say bye-bye to the sign for now.

78
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,213
MATT: It'll be back.

79
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,501
ZAC: Hey, Matt. We already have another 50
winner.

80
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,638
(laughter)

81
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,899
ZAC: It was SonicaMoto.

82
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,645
MATT: SonicaMoto is our new winner, already.
Congratulations, SonicaMoto.

83
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:24,320
LIAM: We need less than 300 subs for that bear. I
think we can do that.

84
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,257
I think that's pretty likely.

85
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,914
MARISHA: You get nail wraps.

86
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:32,314
MATT: You get a bear behind us for the rest of the
show.

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,182
MARISHA: You get a player's handbook signed by us.

88
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:41,850
TALIESIN: Encourage this. Oh no, encourage this.
(laughs) I encourage bear.

89
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:54,416
ORION: (laughing) I do encourage... Nope. Okay. I
am a trained comedian. That is not a thing.

90
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:58,151
MATT: Last but not least, before we get started,
we do have one guest in the studio who's been watching

91
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:01,580
for a bit tonight. Our good friend, JorÃ© is over
here from quite a distance.

92
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:03,417
We met him at Comic Con.

93
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,830
TRAVIS: Put your head right here.

94
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,821
MATT: A fantastically talented artist. For those
of you who have seen my profile picture on Twitter

95
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:18,000
or Facebook, the really amazing artwork of me as a
dungeon master, this is the man that did it. Where

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,462
can they see your work online?

97
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,815
JORE: I have a Facebook--

98
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,402
MARISHA and ORION: Drop down.

99
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:36,961
JROE: There's a Facebook page. You can search
J-O-R-E on Facebook, and that's probably me. If

100
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:39,282
you see Matt's picture, then that's me.

101
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:45,026
TRAVIS: And my Grog raging one with blood covering
his face. (growls)

102
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,498
MATT: Go ahead and have a seat.

103
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:51,156
MARISHA: Speaking of amazing artists. We want to
do a shout out.

104
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,757
ORION: There's a couple more announcements. This
one.

105
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,026
MARISHA: This one, yes.

106
00:08:55,026 --> 00:09:01,184
ORION: Our wonderful artists. Kit Buss and...

107
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:08,595
MARISHA: Kit Buss and Wendy Doodles. Wendy Green.
They're awesome friends of ours and fans of the

108
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:14,514
show. They do amazing work. They've done a lot of
the character work that you've seen, and they're

109
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:19,510
going to be doing a lot more, and we just wanted
to really appreciate them and show them some love,

110
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,365
so yes. Go follow.

111
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:25,960
ORION: Our artists. As Laura would say.

112
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,986
LAURA: That's good. That's very see-able.

113
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:32,194
MARISHA: Okay. Is it see-able now? I want to make
sure. Go follow them. They deserve it.

114
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:36,156
MATT: They've been really amazing. I know many of
you have asked about what's the backstory to Vox

115
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:40,912
Machina? What's that history before the stream
started? We're working on something. It may take a

116
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:46,132
little bit, but one or more of those artists may
be involved. But when we do have that available

117
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:49,842
to you, it should be really cool, and I hope
you'll enjoy it. Anyway.

118
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:55,432
ORION: Oh, also, since this is fantasy, I'd like
to announce that my show went pretty well that's

119
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:59,882
on Mondays, 7-10 on this channel.

120
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,713
TALIESIN: You have a show? What kind of show is
it?

121
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:09,025
ORION: Ooh, I'm glad you asked, Taliesin. It is me
and Jessica Merizan playing Final Fantasy XIV. We

122
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,866
just found each other in the same world. There's a
free company we're going to start. You can come on

123
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:19,268
and join if you're already subscribing. We do
giveaways for subscribers who are watching and

124
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:26,148
active in the chat during the show for stuff with
Square Enix. It's all good times. I'm happy to say

125
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:33,151
that Taliesin, man, Thancred is still in this
version of Final Fantasy XIV, so you can check his

126
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:39,844
work out too, and he's awesome. The funny thing is
I didn't know your character was like a badass. So

127
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:44,480
I was listening to him and I was like "Oh fuck".
Yeah, he's great. So check it out. Every Monday

128
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,310
7-10 on the channel.

129
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,358
MATT: There you go. Also all you League fans out
there, I hope you're enjoying your new Bilgewater

130
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:54,216
update. Anyone else have any announcements they
want to make?

131
00:10:54,216 --> 00:11:00,539
LAURA: Oh we're going to be at Otakon this weekend
in Baltimore. Come say hi!

132
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,992
We're leaving right after this.

133
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:08,485
TALIESIN: I've got a tiny announcement, which is
Ant-Man the movie is really good. If you like

134
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:13,469
Ant-Man the movie, you can hear me as Ant-Man,
being not nearly as funny, in the pinball game.

135
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:17,220
I'm not nearly as funny as Paul Rudd.

136
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,714
ORION: Oh pish posh.

137
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:21,074
ZAC: Matt? We've got another giveaway.

138
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,420
TALIESIN: Yeah!

139
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,909
MARISHA: (singing) Eight-foot Trinket, here we
come!

140
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:26,884
ZAC: OhGreatLampShade.

141
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:29,831
MATT: OhGreatLampShade is the winner of our next
giveaway.

142
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:34,401
LIAM: OhGreatLampShade, we thank thee for thy
mercy.

143
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:40,348
MATT: Congratulations. Player's Handbook signed,
picture signed, and nail wraps. And a step closer

144
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:43,217
to giant eight-foot Trinket.

145
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,065
TRAVIS: Don't do it. No more.

146
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,706
LIAM: Are you sad that you will no longer be the
tallest member of our group?

147
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:53,534
LAURA: I feel like we're just delaying starting
because we're going to have to face that fact that

148
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,144
Pike isn't with us as soon as we start.

149
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:59,345
TRAVIS: And Scanlan's still in the pooper. He's
not really.

150
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,809
MARISHA: Yeah, where is Scanlan?

151
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,540
LIAM: He's shitting on a bed somewhere. It's his
thing.

152
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,651
MATT: Is he on his way?

153
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,838
LAURA: He's on his way, yeah.

154
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,553
MATT: Well when he arrives... In the meantime--

155
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,797
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

156
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,607
ORION: I'm going to get something to drink.

157
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,019
LAURA: He's getting a drink.

158
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,579
MATT: Okay. As Tiberius has an aneurysm and falls
to the ground--

159
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:27,963
TRAVIS: Yes! I go over and provide very vigorous
CPR. No mouth to mouth, just that hand part.

160
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,431
MATT: Yeah. All right, make a death save.

161
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,685
ORION: What? Ow!

162
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:38,796
(cheering)

163
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,786
ORION: And I brought Scanlan with me.

164
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,907
MARISHA: (laughs) Like a trailing fart.

165
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,994
TRAVIS: (laughing) "Like a trailing fart."

166
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:47,557
ORION: That couldn't have worked out better.

167
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,319
SAM: Oh really?

168
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,624
LAURA: What is he wearing?

169
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:58,486
TRAVIS: "Asp Hole?" What does it say? "Where you"
what?

170
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,855
SAM: It's the Asp Hole.

171
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:03,236
LIAM: Asp. Hole.

172
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:08,963
SAM: It's just a bar that I like to go to. Down at
the Asp Hole.

173
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:11,776
LIAM: And I got shit for talking about bears
today.

174
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:15,312
MATT: No, I'm pretty sure that's somewhere in
Emon.

175
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:17,600
(laughter)

176
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,896
TRAVIS: And we'll find it.

177
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,499
SAM: Yeah, we'll find the Asp Hole.

178
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,223
MATT: Yeah, so let's actually start this game,
guys. Thank you for being patient with our intro

179
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,778
here. We've been gone for two weeks. We have a lot
to talk about, so thank you for letting us get

180
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:34,444
that out. So picking up where we left off, the
party completed the venture of taking the horn of

181
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:39,690
Orcus to a place of safety and sealing it away,
hopefully for eternity, with the help of Lady

182
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:46,409
Kima, to the scalebearers. After heading to the
basement of the Platinum Sanctuary in the city of

183
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,439
Vasselheim, they've succeeded to do so.
Vasselheim, which is a distant city to the far

184
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:57,044
northwest of the continent they're used to. This
city is a very devout, religion-based city, and

185
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:02,381
currently considered the oldest bastion of
civilization in the known civilized world. After

186
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:08,940
taking a skyship across the ocean to get there,
sealing the Horn, you guys also discover upon

187
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,471
doing so that the ruins, long-forgotten ruins, of
what appears to be an ancient temple to Sarenrae

188
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:21,241
were recently discovered. While Sarenrae does not
have a strong following in this city, the few that

189
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:27,012
are trying to raise it ask for Pike's help to stay
back and help build it and bring it to its former

190
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:32,294
glory. Hopefully to re-establish a basis of
worship in this city, and she decided to help

191
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:37,040
these folks. The party then steps away from the
ruins of the tower,

192
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,972
sad but understanding of the circumstance.

193
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:47,403
LIAM: Perhaps we could sit on a nearby rooftop and
watch Pike work.

194
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,081
LAURA: Just for the next eight months?

195
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,004
TRAVIS: I'd be all right with that.

196
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,865
MARISHA: That's not creepy at all.

197
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:59,186
MATT: Critical Role all of a sudden becomes the
greatest grass-watching game of all time. As you

198
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:03,632
all stand there, you have to decide your next
course of action. You stand in the muddy road,

199
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:10,285
taking in the cold dusk air as the sun slowly sets
to the west. Now, this area of the city has a

200
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,151
vastly different feel than the Platinum Sanctuary.
In the haste to make it to the ruin, you've passed

201
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:19,456
out of the section that seems to be under
Bahamut's watch and into a different area. In this

202
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:25,579
area, most of the buildings are reinforced with
ruddy iron plates. Plumes of smoke rise up from a

203
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,360
handful of heavy smokestacks. You can see over the
rooftops in the distance toward the center of this

204
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,877
section what looks like a massive dark red statue
of a muscular bearded man.

205
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:41,417
LIAM: The beauty of this game is I have no idea
what the shit we're going to do right now.

206
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:46,515
SAM: So we're standing outside the place where we
just left Pike?

207
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:47,965
MATT: Yeah, the ruins of the tower.

208
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:51,776
MARISHA: So we're essentially standing in the
middle of a town being like, now what?

209
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,566
LAURA: Should we go look at that statue, then?

210
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,153
TALIESIN: I want to see if there's an
inscription.

211
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,784
MATT: If you'd like to.

212
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,256
TALIESIN: Yes, that would be lovely.

213
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:07,595
SAM: While he's doing that, Scanlan is feeling
still terribly sad about leaving Pike. So overcome

214
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:14,810
with emotion that he must step into the ruins one
last time, just to see the place where she's going

215
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:23,156
to be for the next several months, years. And
before I do so, I drink one of my potions that I

216
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:30,081
bought from what's-his-butt. Gilmore, the glorious
Gilmore. Yes.

217
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,318
MATT: All right.

218
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,704
SAM: I don't know how it works, but I'm going to
drink it anyway.

219
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:34,909
MATT: Okay, you drink it.

220
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:41,826
SAM: Okay, I drink it. I go inside the ruins and
look around and touch some of the walls and look

221
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:48,615
at the stonework and everything. I want to see
where she's going to be so I know she's safe.

222
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:58,019
Overcome with a little bit of verklempt emotion, I
shed a single tear.

223
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,809
MATT: As you quietly take this moment to yourself
amongst the ruins, you can hear the clattering of

224
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:11,500
stonework as the small band of Sarenrae worshipers
are now being helped by Pike, who's gathered them

225
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,752
into a plan as to how to remove and restore
portions of the building that are currently

226
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:21,506
visible from the dirt and earth that it's embedded
in. Hearing her voice echo through the hallway,

227
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:27,714
it's a very comforting sense. You feel a rumbling
in your stomach.

228
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:37,481
SAM: I feel uncomfortable. It must be the
emotion.

229
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,420
MATT: It's probably the emotion.

230
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:47,872
SAM: I find a side chamber or a little nook.
Somewhere where I can have some privacy.

231
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:53,207
MATT: Okay. You find your way back towards the
makeshift wooden plank stairway and there was a

232
00:17:53,207 --> 00:18:00,287
small alcove not far from there within the earth
wall that looks to be relatively private. There's

233
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:05,486
little to no light, and it does have a view of the
current ruin.

234
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:13,011
SAM: I say a little prayer, and I take a big dump
on the floor.

235
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,837
TRAVIS: (laughing) No you do not!

236
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,428
SAM: Well, my stomach was rumbling.

237
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:19,586
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're in a temple, man!

238
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:25,629
LAURA: Pike's probably going to have to be the one to
clean that up!

239
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:33,921
SAM: Sometimes it just affects me. I have weak
nerves. And as I'm squatting, I hum to myself.

240
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:45,723
(singing) How do I say goodbye to what we almost
had?

241
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,574
ORION: This is not romantic at all, you know that,
right?

242
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,276
MATT: Welcome back, guys.

243
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,447
MARISHA: I've missed you guys so much.

244
00:18:53,447 --> 00:19:02,881
MATT: As you finish your business, you step away
from the alcove back to the stairway. The contents

245
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:10,727
of the potion seem to have had some effect, as the
remnants of what you leave behind have a very soft

246
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,812
blue glowing hue to them.

247
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:15,059
SAM: I left a magic dump.

248
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,991
TRAVIS: Do we need to collect the dump?

249
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,670
SAM: Nope. We should leave the dump.

250
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,182
LAURA: Are you going to be able to see through the
dump?

251
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,640
TRAVIS: He's covering his face. I think we need
the blue shit.

252
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,215
MARISHA: Can you cast Detect Magic on the poo?

253
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,914
SAM: It's already magical poo.

254
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,899
ORION: Are we there? We're not there.

255
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,387
LAURA: We're not there. It's just Scanlan.

256
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,153
ORION: Okay. So he's just shitting.

257
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,683
LAURA: He's just leaving it.

258
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:43,027
SAM: So I leave and rejoin my fellows, wiping the
tear from my eye and the poo from my bottom.

259
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:46,334
ORION: Well, I love you Ashley. I do.

260
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,536
MARISHA: This is what happens when we don't have
any direction.

261
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,597
TRAVIS: But what's the purpose of the potion? To
make your poo blue?

262
00:19:50,597 --> 00:20:01,344
SAM: I took a potion that will let me see through
my poo and check in on Pike from time to time.

263
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:06,513
LAURA: Will she realize you can see her through
the poop?

264
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,655
SAM: I certainly hope not.

265
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:12,082
LAURA: Wouldn't that be great if she could just
talk to you through the poo?

266
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,306
LIAM: Why aren't the priests going to shovel that
shit up?

267
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:22,017
SAM: As long as some of my cellular remains are
there, I might be able to see

268
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:23,485
a little bit into the room.

269
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,100
LIAM: What's "cellular?"

270
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,866
SAM: (laughs) It's poo.

271
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:29,691
LIAM: Oh, you mean little flakes of poo.

272
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:40,368
MATT: For the sake of brevity in story progression
here, and to dissuade a 30-minute conversation

273
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:47,733
about Scanlan's excrement. After you've rejoined
the party, the sun is now set. The cold air is

274
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:53,966
beginning to really sweep in through the streets.
The clouds overhead begin to slowly rumble and you

275
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:57,964
can hear distant thunder, and you get the feeling
due to the moisture in the air, you're not too far

276
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,271
away from a rain.

277
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:02,008
LAURA: Should we bunk for the night before we head
out in the morning?

278
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:03,601
TALIESIN: I say we head to the ship.

279
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,472
TRAVIS: Wasn't there a guy with a red beard we
were supposed to go see?

280
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:11,090
LAURA: I wanted to wander over to the statue while
Scanlan was dumping.

281
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,959
SAM: I feel great right now, by the way.

282
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:16,076
TALIESIN: Finding some relief in the situation.

283
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:23,953
ORION: Damn it. Just when I was starting to like
you, gnome.

284
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:27,052
LIAM: Moving on. Let's go take a look at this
statue.

285
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,592
MATT: (chuckling) All right.

286
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:34,772
SAM: It's magic poo!

287
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:40,669
LIAM: Don't change, Scanlan.

288
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:46,609
MATT: As you guys make your way through the center
of this district--

289
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,338
LAURA: I feel like it's dark now.

290
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:56,318
MATT: Yeah. You get the sense that this area, most
of the people that live in this area are more

291
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:59,661
rough-and-tumble than the already-rough people
who live in Vasselheim, from what you've

292
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:08,178
encountered. The buildings themselves all seem to
be reinforced with iron plates and it looks like

293
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:15,331
there is a very heavy trade in metalwork, and a
lot of the construction of anything metallic

294
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:21,538
appears to be coming through or from this portion
of the town. As you approach closer to this

295
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,893
statue, it's not just a statue. You see it is
actually sitting atop what looks to be a large,

296
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:33,005
blocky fortress-like temple. Unlike the Platinum
Sanctuary, which is a very beautiful but simple

297
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:41,764
array, this one has a crenellated top to each of
these walled structures. You can see braziers

298
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:49,001
blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top
of it. You can see, as you approach the front of

299
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:54,180
this, there are two giant stone doorways with
steps that look up to it and what looks to be two

300
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:01,699
gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides
and then open up outward towards the entire city

301
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:06,539
in front of it. I'm going to ask you guys to make
a religion check, if you could.

302
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,185
TRAVIS: Oh, I got this.

303
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,499
ORION: Natural 20!

304
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,926
TALIESIN: Yeah! Natural 20.

305
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,510
TALIESIN and ORION: Boom!

306
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,086
ORION: That's so cool.

307
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,507
TRAVIS: Natural four.

308
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:22,486
TALIESIN: Because we know our shit.

309
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:28,931
MATT: As you guys begin your approach, even in the
darkness, you can see the figure, this human-like

310
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:36,729
man. Barrel-chested. Massive muscles. What looks
almost like iron bracers around his wrists. He is

311
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:42,385
carved or sculpted from solid iron or plates that
have been put together from some sort of iron

312
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:50,664
initial structure. The beard is long and goes to
about mid-chest. He carries in one hand this long,

313
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:58,103
thick shortsword and has furs and leathers about
his legs and midsection. You recognize this to be

314
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,676
a very hefty depiction of the deity Kord.

315
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,740
LAURA, SAM, and TRAVIS: Kord?

316
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,541
TRAVIS: I admire his beard.

317
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,232
MATT: It is a beard worth admiring.

318
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:09,098
MARISHA: How might one spell Kord?

319
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,510
MATT: K-O-R-D.

320
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,306
MARISHA: Simple. I like that.

321
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:18,553
SAM: He's a god of some sort?

322
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:19,997
MATT: He is, indeed.

323
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:25,012
TALIESIN: Tell us of this Kord. Try to find your
notes of this Kord.

324
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:30,232
LAURA: He's a dwarven god?

325
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,660
MATT: Not dwarven.

326
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,354
LIAM: A man. Human.

327
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:44,007
MATT: Kord is essentially a deity of warfare,
combat, and storms. A god that has been

328
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:51,537
long-worshipped by tribal cultures from long past
that enjoyed the essence of battle

329
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:54,488
and challenge and combat.

330
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:58,496
LIAM: Did you say storms, Tiberius? War and combat
and storms?

331
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:04,597
ORION: Storms, yes. Storms and winds.

332
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:10,009
MATT: And quickly, the motif of this section of
the town comes into play. This, you assume, is the

333
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,564
portion of the city that is dedicated to the
temple of Kord,

334
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:14,423
this being the structure before you.

335
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:21,178
MARISHA: Does it seem to be a central theme across
the whole town? This town worships Kord?

336
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:30,559
MATT: No. You've only really been to two sections.
The first one you were brought to was primarily

337
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,646
under the worship of Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon.

338
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,943
MARISHA: Okay. (giggles)

339
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,367
TALIESIN: Getting the giggles out.

340
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:46,088
TRAVIS: Did you look at it? Did you use your fancy
eyes to look at it?

341
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:53,481
TALIESIN: Well, my question is, is this a temple?
If it is a temple to Kord, is this a place of

342
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:59,485
battle? Is this somewhere where people go watch
battles and fighting?

343
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:08,151
MATT: From the exterior, and it is a closed-off
temple, it looks like a large, blocky, obstinate

344
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:14,463
fortress that is nearly impenetrable from the way
it's constructed and reinforced. You don't know

345
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:15,719
what's inside of it.

346
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,737
LIAM: There's a big gate or door at the front?

347
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:22,412
MATT: Two large iron doors about 20 feet tall that
are currently shut. It's about five or six steps

348
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:23,449
getting up to it.

349
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,602
LAURA: And it's nighttime?

350
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:25,834
MATT: It is nighttime currently, yes.

351
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:31,327
LIAM: Are there any citizens out right now, or are
we alone in the dark?

352
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:35,738
MATT: As it has gotten to dusk, it's thinned out a
little bit, but there are a few individuals

353
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:39,202
walking by, carrying pickaxes over one shoulder
and passing by.

354
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:43,328
LIAM: I'd like to walk over to the nearest one and
ask.

355
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,931
SAM: To who?

356
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:47,099
LIAM: To a passerby.

357
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:51,640
MATT: The two gentlemen, one's in his mid-20s. The
one that turns to you initially probably looks a

358
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,501
little older than that. Late 30s, grizzled. Shaven,
but the five-o'clock shadow has definitely kicked

359
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:02,492
in. Longer, tousled hair, dirt on the face. Simple
clothing, pickaxe over his shoulder and what looks

360
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,710
like a leather belt that carries other tools.

361
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,781
SAM: These are dwarves?

362
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:09,985
MATT: These are human. "Yes? I heard you
calling."

363
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:16,868
LIAM: Excuse me, good sir. My friend over here,
the dragonborn. He seems to think that this is

364
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:23,549
some sort of temple or edifice to the god Kord. I
just want to know, is he correct?

365
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,759
MATT: "Is this your first time in the Braving
Grounds?"

366
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,010
ORION: In Dwarvish, I say--

367
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,610
SAM: They're not dwarves.

368
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,104
MATT: You can still say it, though.

369
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:32,945
(laughter)

370
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:42,059
LIAM: Yes, absolutely! This is our first time. We
literally just rolled into Vasselheim. What can

371
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,687
you tell us of this? It's an impressive
structure.

372
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:50,300
MATT: The younger gentleman next to him, similarly
dressed, begins to speak up. He puts his hand up

373
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:56,248
and goes, "The Braving Grounds is the area of this
city that is built around the worship of the great

374
00:27:56,248 --> 00:28:03,600
"god Kord. His protection and strength he bestows
upon those who live for the sake of challenge. To

375
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,942
"prove oneself better with each passing day, that
is the basis of the Braving Grounds."

376
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:12,145
LAURA: So it's like a battleground?

377
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:18,327
MATT: "It's a community that when called to battle
can definitely defend itself.

378
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:24,100
"What you see before you--" He looks up at 
the giant structure. "This

379
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,231
"is called the Trial Forge. It is the oldest known 
temple to Kord and has been built and rebuilt for

380
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:33,269
"many, many hundreds of years."

381
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:35,644
ORION: (chuckles) Hence forge, right?

382
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:41,759
LIAM: And does one need to be a priest or cleric
of this faith to challenge oneself?

383
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,273
Or can anyone--

384
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,687
TRAVIS: Worship?

385
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:54,097
MATT: "Anyone is able to worship what deity they
wish in this town. We have an understanding. If

386
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,771
"you're looking for a tussle, what you're looking
for is the Crucible."

387
00:28:56,771 --> 00:29:01,962
TRAVIS: Yes. What else can you tell us about this
Crucible?

388
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:08,943
MATT: "The Crucible is a fighting pit. I mean,
there is a sacred arena within the temple, but

389
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:14,844
"that's reserved for very, very special occasions.
If you're looking to just get your fight on and

390
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:18,485
"punch someone in the face, the Crucible is what
you're looking for." He spits off to the side and

391
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:21,065
points a little ways down the roadway.

392
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,983
MARISHA: I think Grog wants to go.

393
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:28,162
MATT: "Beyond that way, you'll see a tavern known
as the Bellows' Respite."

394
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:31,071
SAM: Bellows' Respite.

395
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:37,024
MATT: "One of the finer inns you'll find in the
Braving Grounds proper, but I take it if you walk

396
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:39,702
"that direction, you'll see the Crucible before too
long."

397
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,629
LAURA: Have you ever fought in the Crucible?

398
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:46,590
MATT: "Me? No. Too busy. Too many people better
fighters than me in there.

399
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,262
"I'll just stick to the mines."

400
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:51,177
MARISHA: Are these battles to the death?

401
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:59,920
MATT: "Nah. These are battles of honor. Death
belongs in a true war. Mind you, there have been

402
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,529
"some folks unfortunately who may have fallen to a
hit on the head too hard, and that's

403
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:09,525
"understandable. But the purpose of Kord is not
necessarily to smite your foes unless they've

404
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:14,273
"given you damn good reason. Other than that,
contest of strength is how we live."

405
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:18,483
ORION: A friendly sparring match is what we're
about.

406
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:25,005
LIAM: That's this neighborhood of Vasselheim, not
the city as a whole, just in these parts?

407
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:32,084
MATT: "For the most part. I mean, we have members
of our community that are Bastions and guard the

408
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:35,568
"whole city, but we tend to keep our own--"

409
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:38,294
(off-screen crash)

410
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,575
MATT: "Pardon my friend. He's clumsy." And the
other gentleman

411
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,713
picks up his tools and is like, "Sorry."

412
00:30:42,713 --> 00:30:53,449
TRAVIS: Have you been to this Crucible often, and
if so, is there a champion or a favorite that

413
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:55,557
you've seen or know of?

414
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:59,434
MATT: "We have some people come in and out.
Probably best to ask around the Crucible, to be

415
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:04,205
"honest. I've seen some people take some serious
beatings down there. I haven't kept much attention

416
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:06,462
"to it. I haven't the money to sling around it."

417
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:09,541
LAURA: The money? Wait, it costs money?

418
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:15,473
MATT: "What, you think there's going to be fights
in a pit and no one's betting on it? Welcome to

419
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,101
"Vasselheim, my dear."

420
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:20,811
TRAVIS: We're going to be rich!

421
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,222
ORION: What if there are two people fighting the
town does not know?

422
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:26,431
MATT: "I don't know. Take it up at the Crucible."

423
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:29,408
TRAVIS: How far is the Crucible from here?

424
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:31,224
MATT: "Keep walking. You'll see it."

425
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:35,892
LAURA: Keep walking? Thank you, friend.

426
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:40,993
MATT: "My pleasure. Kord's strength to you." And
he keeps on walking.

427
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:42,591
TRAVIS: Kord's strength.

428
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:43,996
SAM: Kord's strength to you.

429
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:46,141
MATT: No, core strength.

430
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:49,659
LAURA: Sit-ups. Crunches.

431
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,717
TRAVIS: Core strength to you. Namaste.

432
00:31:52,717 --> 00:32:00,653
MATT: You guys walk beyond the Trial Forge, back
towards the path where you came off to the side on

433
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:05,804
the left and you can see most of the buildings,
their internal lighting is very low; you can see

434
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:09,754
most folks either go to bed at this evening or at
least keep a very low visual profile from their

435
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:17,837
abodes. However, lights are blazing from the
interior of this three-story inn. The Bellows'

436
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:23,474
Respite is definitely a rowdy place. You can hear
already the shouts and music streaming from the

437
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:31,134
interior of it. You gather that, while there are a
lot of people inside you can see at the windows

438
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:36,320
and openings to the inside of the tavern, there is
a large group gathered in the middle of the

439
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,157
thoroughfare just outside of it. Looks like a
circle of individuals that are all shouting and

440
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:48,519
screaming over each other, big fist-pumps to the
air, some folks are angrily throwing their coin

441
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,885
purses to the ground.

442
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:53,099
TRAVIS: Like a kid getting too close to an
amusement park, I take off running.

443
00:32:53,099 --> 00:33:00,235
MATT: Grog starts running up, bounding up the way,
you can see the actual--

444
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:02,510
MARISHA: Grog? Grog, not too far ahead!

445
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,968
TRAVIS: Okay!

446
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:07,887
LIAM: I don't start running, but I'm following
behind him and I take out my Keen Dagger and just

447
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,255
start sort of dancing it across my hand as I
follow after him.

448
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:15,372
MATT: David Bowie and the glass orb.

449
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:17,473
LIAM: Yes, exactly.

450
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:20,456
ORION: Is there a registry or something like
that?

451
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:27,300
MATT: Actually, as you approach you can see there
is no registry, there is quite literally a pit in

452
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:40,276
the ground. It's a 15, 20-foot dip. It is a
carved-out pit, maybe no more than I'd say 25, 30

453
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:47,859
feet across. And there is no ladder, there is no
step going down, there's just two people in there

454
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,339
beating the ever-living crap out of each other and
a crowd of people gathering around. You do see

455
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:56,047
what looks to be two very well-dressed gentlemen
that are in the process of collecting and paying

456
00:33:56,047 --> 00:34:03,136
out, and you approach just as the final hit takes
to this gentleman's jaw, this tattooed individual,

457
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,982
you can see bloodied in the face, nose broken,
teeth knocked out, this poor, poor human fellow

458
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:16,166
gets knocked clean onto the ground. You can see
standing over his body this extremely built,

459
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:21,901
aggressive, looks like another human female with
her hair pulled back in a very tight ponytail just

460
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:26,374
spits on his body, turns around and wipes the
blood from the front of her face. Snaps her

461
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:30,172
fingers, and you can see folks bring a ladder and
lean it over the side and she climbs up the ladder

462
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:31,935
as everyone cheers on her way up.

463
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:42,074
MARISHA: Before we get up to the crowd, I
transform into Minxie. I'm going Minxie. And I

464
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:47,607
catch up to Grog. Going Minxie.

465
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,688
TRAVIS: Oh, they don't like magic.

466
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:53,141
MARISHA: Did they see me? I'm trying to do it
stealthily before it happens.

467
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:57,766
MATT: You can make a stealth check if you like.
You do know through the discussions that it's

468
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:03,126
arcane magic that seems to be the shunned element
in this town. As it is a town of worship, divine

469
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,066
magic for the most part seems okay.

470
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,876
MARISHA: Everyone saw me. It's fine.

471
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:14,025
MATT: Everyone would've seen you if they weren't
currently enraptured by the chaos. Those who did

472
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:18,136
notice probably didn't seem to care much other
than a giant tiger now walks up to them.

473
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:23,206
TRAVIS: Can I grab the nearest person near me,
turn whoever's shoulder that is, and go,

474
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,789
who is she?

475
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:32,059
MATT: As you pull the shoulder around, you can see
a rather portly human fellow, balding on top with

476
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:37,157
long Benjamin Franklin-looking hair. Very nice
robes, turns.

477
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:41,297
"Are you new to this town, then, is it?"

478
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:43,137
TRAVIS: Yeah, very new.

479
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:47,575
MATT: "That's the Siren. The Siren."

480
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:53,286
ORION: I approach and saunter next to Grog.

481
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:56,045
TRAVIS: The Siren?

482
00:35:56,045 --> 00:36:01,856
MATT: "She's the one you bet on. Trust me on
that." As he walks over to, you can see another

483
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:08,796
one of these gentlemen, very well-dressed, hair
slicked back. Tall, thin human in very, very fine

484
00:36:08,796 --> 00:36:15,203
purple robes, collects some people's money, begins
giving out a few things, pulls out a notebook with

485
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:18,379
a little charter he's in the middle of putting notes
in.

486
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:24,034
LAURA: Hello. How would we enter a new fighter
into this pit?

487
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:27,691
MATT: "Well, actually, that was the last fighter
scheduled for the evening."

488
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,016
TRAVIS: Be a pity not to have one more.

489
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:32,039
MATT: "You wish to fight?"

490
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,918
TRAVIS: Wish? It's more like an itch. A need.

491
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:42,869
MATT: He puts his arm out and the crowd steps back
a bit and he takes a good, long head-to-toe

492
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,954
up-and-down look at you, walks around from side to
side inspecting you. He gets a little bit close

493
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:51,155
and reaches out, not even asking, he starts
grabbing the side of your arms.

494
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:55,043
MARISHA: I start growling a little bit.

495
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:57,211
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, watch out.

496
00:36:57,211 --> 00:37:07,661
MATT: "Calm down, kitty, calm down." Steps back.
"Well, it's not too late. What caliber of fighter

497
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:09,561
"do you consider yourself?"

498
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,067
TRAVIS: Caliber?

499
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,280
MATT: "Who do you want to fight?"

500
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,877
SAM: Who are the options?

501
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:18,863
ORION: Could he fight anyone?

502
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,837
TRAVIS: This is my friend, Scanlan.

503
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:25,317
SAM: I'm more of his manager than his friend,
actually. Hi, I'm Scanlan.

504
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:26,750
MATT: "Pleasure."

505
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:32,888
SAM: Pleasure's all mine. My brute over here, who
can he battle, what are his options?

506
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:35,381
MATT: "This late in the evening--"

507
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:37,083
LIAM: I'll fight him.

508
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,805
SAM: Excuse me?

509
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,157
LIAM: I said I'll fight him.

510
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:48,020
MATT: "I apologize. If you're going to have
someone enter the arena worth betting on, they

511
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:54,122
"have to go up against one of our proven fighters
first. However, once your friend here gets his

512
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:58,251
"face beaten in, you're more than welcome to join
him in the ring thereafter."

513
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:06,447
TRAVIS: I haven't laughed so hard in my entire
life. Face beaten, he says. Face beaten!

514
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,769
MATT: "You're mighty confident, aren't you?"

515
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:11,745
TRAVIS: It's my middle-- I only have one name.

516
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,917
(laughter)

517
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,211
TRAVIS: If I did.

518
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,870
SAM: It would be that.

519
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,113
TRAVIS: Yeah.

520
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:24,322
MATT: "Well, first and foremost, all bets begin at
100 gold pieces."

521
00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:25,982
LAURA: 100 gold? Is that all?

522
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:28,424
MATT: "You can increase the bet, if you'd like."

523
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:29,390
LAURA: I'd love to.

524
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,520
MATT: "What would you like to bet?"

525
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,484
LAURA: 500 gold on this one right here.

526
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,771
MATT: "Is she the only one betting?"

527
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,030
SAM: She bets for all of us.

528
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:43,113
LIAM: I'll put a thousand down right now that I
can beat the big guy.

529
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,433
SAM: You mean Grog?

530
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:47,447
LIAM: Of my own money. Yes.

531
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,357
LAURA: You can't fight him yet!

532
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:55,568
LIAM: I can't? Rules are meant to be bent and
stretched. Am I right?

533
00:38:55,568 --> 00:39:00,963
MATT: "You're going to put your money down between
your friends to fight your friends."

534
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,891
LIAM: It's a contentious relationship.

535
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:11,646
MATT: His eyes have already wandered from your
face, he says, "500 gold on the goliath. Do we

536
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:17,859
"hear anything else?" A few other individuals step
up and start telling him like, "50 gold down."

537
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,112
"It's a hundred-gold minimum." 
"100 gold."

538
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:21,895
SAM: Who is he fighting?

539
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,480
TRAVIS: We don't know yet.

540
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,846
SAM: We have to bet before we see the meat?

541
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:39,139
MATT: "Unproven fighters with a grandiose sense of
self-ability enjoy the surprise."

542
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:42,924
TALIESIN: So what sort of odds are we talking
about, then?

543
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:48,424
MATT: "For this one, based on your height, reach,
strength and arrogance,

544
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:54,388
"I'd put you at four-to-one against."

545
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:55,948
LAURA: Four-to-one.

546
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:58,334
TRAVIS: Okay.

547
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:03,003
ORION: It's okay, Grog. He doesn't know that
you've beaten up a lot of people.

548
00:40:03,003 --> 00:40:04,186
SAM: Don't tell him.

549
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,566
ORION: Oh, right.

550
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:08,371
TRAVIS: I've got this scar here. How does he think
I got it?

551
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,999
SAM: Those are fair odds, we'll take that.

552
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:13,712
MATT: "All right. 500 gold. Is this all I'm
hearing?"

553
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,209
TRAVIS: A hundred of my own gold on me.

554
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:17,737
MATT: "600 gold."

555
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,278
TALIESIN: Hold on.

556
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:23,913
SAM: I'll bet 50 gold against him. We have to
hedge!

557
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:28,029
MATT: "100 gold is the minimum bet."

558
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:34,029
SAM: Well then, I can't afford it. I'm sorry. We
have to hedge.

559
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:39,159
LAURA: You're going to get it, Grog. You're going
to do it. I have faith in you.

560
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,729
ORION: I'll put 500 gold on the goliath.

561
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:44,882
LAURA: Oh my god. We're going to lose all our
money on Grog. No we're not.

562
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:50,988
MATT: "All right. Last bets, last bets!" Everyone
starts putting in their cash. A couple folks

563
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:53,055
frenzy over, you see a couple guys--

564
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,650
LIAM: I put a thousand on the goliath.

565
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,829
SAM: What?

566
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,491
LIAM: 1,000 gold on the goliath.

567
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:05,229
LAURA: Sing a song. Do you use arcane magic or do
you use divine magic? Just sing a song, Scanlan.

568
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:14,421
MATT: "It seems your friends are confident in your
ability. Let's hope we can put their money where

569
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:16,106
"your mouth is."

570
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,968
TRAVIS: In my mouth?

571
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:19,485
SAM: It's an expression.

572
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:21,675
MATT: "All right."

573
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:28,833
MARISHA: I brush against Grog. And I cast
Stoneskin on him.

574
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,233
SAM: Will that show?

575
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:32,624
MARISHA: Does that show?

576
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:36,063
MATT: You cannot cast a spell when you're in beast
form.

577
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:40,856
LIAM: Plus, kitty, you did that once and it didn't
work out so well.

578
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:45,557
ORION: As I notice what the cat's doing, I'm
standing right next to him, so I do it

579
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,657
with my hand instead.

580
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,517
LIAM: You got caught with your hand in the cookie
jar.

581
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:59,408
MATT: As you begin casting the spell, immediately
the guy says, "You do that one more time and

582
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:02,832
"you're all disqualified from ever competing."

583
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:09,053
ORION: Okay. I'm sorry, I just thought I'd give my
friend an advantage.

584
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:13,021
TALIESIN: He'll be fine. Look at him. He'll be
fine.

585
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:15,834
ORION: Yes, I have two eyes.

586
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:23,318
MATT: At which point, the other individual
whispers into the initial bookie's ear.

587
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:27,044
"Yes. Retrieve him, please."

588
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,331
TRAVIS: Him?

589
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:34,517
MATT: "For this fight, we have a newcomer. A
newcomer who is named--"

590
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:38,231
TRAVIS: Should I have a fancy name?

591
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:40,291
SAM: Yeah, you should have a fancy fighting name.

592
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,535
ORION: Grog the Destroyer.

593
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,751
TRAVIS: Phillip.

594
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:44,202
(laughter)

595
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,486
ORION: No, that's like the opposite of what I
said.

596
00:42:46,486 --> 00:42:57,810
MATT: "Phillip, the newcomer, has decided to hedge
his and his friends' savings that he, upon what I

597
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:06,649
"can only imagine is his first arrival into
Vasselheim, to get his face pummeled by our

598
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:12,166
"current standing champion: Kern the Hammer."

599
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:20,308
At this point, the crowd immediately goes quiet
and whispering, you can see a few individuals now

600
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:23,818
walking over, ushering this man, looks like he
just stepped out of the nearby mines, he's got

601
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:31,968
coal dirt on his face. When I say man, it is a
six-foot-six, very visibly half-orc gentleman,

602
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:40,123
built like some sort of thick-ass building you've
walked past coming through here. Bald head, big,

603
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:44,775
bristly mustache, and a face that's obviously
taken a beating over the years. He walks up

604
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:49,789
nonchalantly, just wearing a simple tattered
tunic, leather pants and boots. You can see him

605
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:54,755
like cracking his fingers. He looks over to the
side at one of the guys. "They better have pulled

606
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:57,992
"me out of work for a good reason. Who am I up
against?"

607
00:43:57,992 --> 00:43:59,994
TRAVIS: I envy your facial hair.

608
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:05,798
MATT: "I envy your currently unbroken face.
Currently."

609
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:10,609
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill him. That's a rule,
right? I'm not supposed to kill him?

610
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:14,352
LAURA: You're not supposed to kill him. No killing
allowed in this?

611
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:20,661
MATT: The bookie steps forward. "No killing.
Fighting until one falls."

612
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,162
TRAVIS: What happens if they start to cry?

613
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,032
MATT: "Then you keep punching."

614
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,779
TRAVIS: I like it.

615
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:40,918
MATT: "No weapons. No armor. Fists against fists
until one of them falls. Lower the ladder." As

616
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:54,748
they put the ladder down into the arena. You can
see the orc gentleman pulls out a small, enclosed,

617
00:44:54,748 --> 00:45:01,464
almost like a wineskin, like an iron wineskin,
unscrews it and drinks it all down.

618
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,383
TRAVIS: Kern the Shithead does?

619
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:06,314
MATT: Yeah. Puts it down, throws it to the ground,
with a ting-ting-ting.

620
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:12,671
LAURA: Wait, what was in that? Was that wine?

621
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:16,088
MATT: "It is customary to drink before a fight."

622
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,908
TRAVIS: Can I have my cask of ale, real fast?

623
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:26,715
LAURA: Wait, does anybody have a Potion of
Stoneskin or anything good?

624
00:45:26,715 --> 00:45:32,048
MATT: As everyone gathers around, you can now see
people are coming back out of the tavern to gather

625
00:45:32,048 --> 00:45:38,663
around the outskirts of the Crucible. Grog gets
lowered down the ladder.

626
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:40,306
SAM: Oh, he's already down?

627
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:42,896
MATT: Well, Grog, what else do you want to do
before you prepare?

628
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:45,407
TRAVIS: What do I want to do to prepare?

629
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,851
MATT: Well, if you haven't gone down yet. The
other guy has come down the ladder.

630
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:51,586
TRAVIS: I took a drink from the cask of ale--

631
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:58,483
SAM: Wait, I come over to Grog and I just look in
his eyes and I say, listen, you've got this, I

632
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:06,446
can't give you anything else, but you've got this,
man. And I also very quickly take out my Potion of

633
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:12,954
Fire Giant Strength and I slip it to him before he
takes a drink of his ale.

634
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:15,441
I don't know if I hand it to him.

635
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,570
MATT: Make a stealth check.

636
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:21,174
SAM: Okay. (squeaks) Nope.

637
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:23,487
MATT: What did you roll?

638
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,643
SAM: Oh, that's a six. So eight.

639
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:35,638
MATT: All right. As you walk towards him and begin
looking in his eyes, as you begin to pull out the

640
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:43,034
flask, a hand grasps your wrist. And you glance
over and you can see one of the burly human

641
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:49,708
gentlemen that escorted Kern the Hammer in is
currently grasping your arm and says, "I'm

642
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:54,761
"watching you. One more try and I'll throw you in
there. We'll go down ourselves."

643
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:57,080
SAM: It's for my asthma. I promise.

644
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,063
MATT: Shoves you back away, still clutching it.
Looks to you, Grog, up into your eyes. "You going

645
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:04,694
"to climb down and fight or you going to be a pussy
about it?"

646
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:09,780
TRAVIS: That's a really good question. I would
like to rage. And I jump in the fucking pit.

647
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:16,482
MATT: You leap over the side, completely avoiding
the ladder, both feet hitting the ground with a

648
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:20,841
heavy thud sound. The packed dust kicks up around
your feet.

649
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:24,482
SAM: Come on, Phillip! Kick his ass!

650
00:47:24,482 --> 00:47:30,447
MATT: At which point, the other orc's finished
cracking his knuckles, just kind of wipes the spit

651
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:36,668
off the edge of his chin, gives you a look
(growls) and you see a bit of foam toss from the

652
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:38,246
side of his mouth.

653
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,832
LIAM: Nobody fucks with Phil.

654
00:47:39,832 --> 00:47:42,093
LAURA: I can smell you from here, Kern!

655
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:44,832
MATT: Go ahead and roll initiative.

656
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:48,417
TRAVIS: 20.

657
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:51,440
MATT: 20! All righty.

658
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,281
ORION: Oh shit, you got a 20?

659
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:57,988
MATT: All right. You actually probably would've
landed there from the run.

660
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:00,052
First round starts. You're up.

661
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:04,727
TRAVIS: I would like to cast Intimidating Presence
on Fern the Fucknut.

662
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:10,216
MATT: Kern. But it's better if Grog gets it
wrong.

663
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:13,405
TRAVIS: He never gets it right. Phillip, thank
you.

664
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:23,914
MATT: Phillip. All right, so. Use your action to
use Intimidating Presence? All right, so what's

665
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,250
the DC on that?

666
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,628
TRAVIS: Saving throw, 13.

667
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:41,805
MATT: 13. That will unfortunately not succeed. As
you glare at him with an angry Phillip glare, your

668
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:45,605
bellow echoing through the bottom of this
Crucible, which in itself forms a very interesting

669
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:52,187
acoustic amplifying of your yell, you can see Kern
on the other side is looking at you with the same

670
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:53,981
intense, burning rage.

671
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:59,607
SAM: Wait, that's your whole move?

672
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:02,100
MATT: And you can move if you like.

673
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,987
TRAVIS: I'll let him come to me.

674
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:09,525
MATT: Okay. All right. So as you stand there
waiting with fists at your side, Kern takes his

675
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:14,277
turn. You can see he begins to circle a little bit
around you as he begins to spiral about with an

676
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:20,480
unnerving speed, dashes forward, fists come
swinging, one, two. Both strikes coming towards

677
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,425
you. That is a 19.

678
00:49:23,425 --> 00:49:24,835
TRAVIS: Misses.

679
00:49:24,835 --> 00:49:28,883
MATT: This is all fisticuffs. That is a 24.

680
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,009
TRAVIS: That hits.

681
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:36,467
MATT: And as a bonus action, using his rage, a
third attack. That is a 21.

682
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:37,816
TRAVIS: That definitely hits.

683
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:39,122
MATT: All righty.

684
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:41,150
LIAM: Would you like to use my spiky die?

685
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,480
SAM: Don't do it. You got this, Phillip.

686
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:50,031
MATT: The first one does eight points of damage.
The second one does seven points of damage. As one

687
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:53,942
fist clips you across the chin, the other one goes
right into your abdominals. You're still tensing

688
00:49:53,942 --> 00:50:00,100
and you feel the impact but you just take the
sheer weight of the force and flex and angrily

689
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,144
stare him down in return.

690
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:05,109
SAM: Phillip, do that thing where you move your
pecs up and down!

691
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:09,028
(laughter)

692
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:16,777
MATT: That's going to be a gif. And as you now see
Kern prepares for a second bout, it's your turn,

693
00:50:16,777 --> 00:50:18,199
Grog. What are you doing?

694
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:23,595
TRAVIS: I would like to go into a frenzied rage. I
would like to start with a giant front-kick

695
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,602
forward and then hammer him down.

696
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:27,796
MATT: All right. Go for the first strike.

697
00:50:27,796 --> 00:50:30,217
TRAVIS: Shit, that misses. Two.

698
00:50:30,217 --> 00:50:31,898
MATT: That's probably going to miss.

699
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:35,683
TRAVIS: Yep. That's a 19.

700
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:37,144
MATT: 19 is going to hit.

701
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:39,120
TRAVIS: And also 19.

702
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,428
MATT: Both hit, yep. So you go to kick with the
front kick, and he dodges to the side. However,

703
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:46,908
you still, using your giant haymaker, the inertia
clips him across the face.

704
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:48,776
Go ahead and roll damage.

705
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:50,569
TRAVIS: That is a 16.

706
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,410
MATT: You're not fighting with your axe. This is
with your fists.

707
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,082
So rolling 1d4 and then half that.

708
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,227
SAM: Half that?

709
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,261
MATT: Yeah.

710
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:00,196
LAURA: You only get half damage of a d4?

711
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,915
MATT: Yep. But you still add your strength
modifier.

712
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:04,529
LIAM: So these guys both potentially have like a
hundred hit points.

713
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:11,001
TRAVIS: Six. It was four, and then half of that is
two, plus my modifier, which is four, so six.

714
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,002
MATT: Correct, so six damage. All righty.

715
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,842
TRAVIS: And then four.

716
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,072
MATT: All righty.

717
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:23,330
TRAVIS: This is what I use? For my fists? I got
big-ass fists! I got tattoos and shit on them. I

718
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,161
never shower, they fucking stink!

719
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:28,839
TALIESIN: You could do more damage if you hit him
with the die, because it's sharp, so you'd

720
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,975
actually get more damage with the d4.

721
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:37,534
MATT: All right. So your modifier is plus-- it's
plus three for the modifier?

722
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:39,150
TRAVIS: No, my modifier's plus four.

723
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,948
MATT: Okay, and then what did you roll on that?

724
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:42,187
TRAVIS: Two. Minus two.

725
00:51:42,187 --> 00:51:43,604
MATT: Two, then five total.

726
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:44,881
TRAVIS: Oh, five, yeah.

727
00:51:44,881 --> 00:51:47,779
MATT: There you go. All righty, cool. So you hit
him across the face and you hit him to the other

728
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:54,828
side. He comes back, aligns his chin, and you can
see he's now stooping in for some sort of an

729
00:51:54,828 --> 00:52:08,270
uppercut as he slips to the side a little bit with
a sidestep. That will be a 25. A 20. And a one. So

730
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,792
what's your AC?

731
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:10,889
TRAVIS: 20.

732
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:17,186
MATT: All right, so both the first two hit. As he
comes low for a full-on uppercut, hitting you for,

733
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:24,556
that would be six points of damage (whack) under
the chin. As you're currently reeling from the

734
00:52:24,556 --> 00:52:33,360
impact, he crouches down and is going to go for a
knee to the middle of your groin. That is another

735
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:40,425
six points of damage (whack) right in the Phillip
junk. You instinctively give out a (grunts) from

736
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:45,721
the impact. After that point, he comes up and it
looks like he tries to go for some sort of a

737
00:52:45,721 --> 00:52:51,770
pile-drive grapple, and you instinctively kick off
of him and his third attack is completely wasted.

738
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,002
It's now your go.

739
00:52:54,002 --> 00:53:02,928
TRAVIS: No one fucks with Phillip Jr. I would like
to bull rush and try and tackle him, and if it

740
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,717
succeeds, I'd like to headbutt him on the ground.

741
00:53:05,717 --> 00:53:10,084
MATT: Okay, okay. It's an action to do that, so you
can use your bonus action to attempt--

742
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,881
TRAVIS: And I would only get two attacks, right?

743
00:53:11,881 --> 00:53:15,362
MATT: You only get one with this, technically.
It's an action to grapple.

744
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,562
TRAVIS: Okay.

745
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:19,085
SAM: Do it.

746
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:21,438
TRAVIS: All right.

747
00:53:21,438 --> 00:53:24,342
MATT: So go ahead and roll an athletics check.

748
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:27,779
TRAVIS: No, that's even better. 22.

749
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:35,186
MATT: 22. Yeah, you slam into him, knock him to
the ground, and you're now on top of him. He's

750
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:38,585
currently considered grappled, and you can go
ahead and attempt your headbutt.

751
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:46,896
TRAVIS: Say hi! (boosh) That's a lot. 24.

752
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:51,375
MATT: 24? Yeah, definitely. So go ahead and roll
damage on the same 1d4.

753
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,094
TRAVIS: 1d4? It's my head!

754
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:54,460
MATT: Yep.

755
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,961
SAM: Your head is so puny.

756
00:53:56,961 --> 00:54:05,217
TRAVIS: It's got tattoos on it. One and a half.
Oh. One and a half plus my strength, right?

757
00:54:05,217 --> 00:54:13,175
MATT: So if it's three or four it's considered
two. So six? All right. So as you tackle him to

758
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:18,569
the ground and he's trying to pull you off, you
reach up, (wham) just slam your forehead directly

759
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:22,052
into the center of his face. As you pull back you
can already see the blood streak off the front

760
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:28,097
of your head as his nose is smushed even further
into his gnarled facade. As you pull back, instead

761
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:34,688
of pain, he's laughing. (laughs) As it comes to
his turn, he's not attempting to break grapple.

762
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,488
He's going to reach up and grab you and attempt to
headbutt you in return.

763
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,898
TRAVIS: I like it.

764
00:54:39,898 --> 00:54:57,291
MATT: That's going to be a 21. A 23. And a 19. All
right, that's a six, seven damage. So total of 13

765
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:03,872
damage. As he reaches up and slams you, slams you
again. And as you start backing up, he goes to

766
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:07,725
slam you a third time, and you catch his head in
the middle of your mitt, and he's now face-to-face

767
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:11,822
with you, just like (snarls). You guys are both
snarling at each other like two rabid beasts.

768
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:12,913
It's your go.

769
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:16,814
TRAVIS: I would like to keep his head right where
I have it and take my elbow and drive it down into

770
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:24,935
the bridge of his nose. So that's 25?

771
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:26,264
MATT: 25 hits.

772
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:30,226
TRAVIS: 22?

773
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,750
MATT: Hits.

774
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,362
TRAVIS: And 17.

775
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:38,011
MATT: 17 does miss. All right. So go ahead and
roll damage for the next two strikes.

776
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:42,067
TRAVIS: With this thing again? Six.

777
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,374
MATT: Six, all righty.

778
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:45,773
TRAVIS: It's hard to get above a six. And six.

779
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:51,963
MATT: Six, nice. So as you hold him down, his
face, (wham). Head goes, cracks against the ground

780
00:55:51,963 --> 00:55:56,288
of the Crucible. As he starts picking his head up
again, you drill back again, (wham) hit him a

781
00:55:56,288 --> 00:56:00,420
second time. This time, you can see now. His nose
was already busted before. Now it's nearly

782
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:07,037
concave. It's like he didn't have a nose before
and there's just a bloody void where it once was.

783
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:14,891
He's still smiling in a weird, twisted way. He
seems to be enjoying this almost as much as you.

784
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:19,907
You go down for the third one, and this time he
reaches up and grabs your elbow. He's going to

785
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:25,108
take his turn to attempt to break your grapple as
his action. Go ahead and roll either an athletics

786
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:27,145
or an acrobatics check.

787
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:31,792
TRAVIS: 12.

788
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:38,925
MATT: 12? All right. He kicks you up back onto
your feet, and as he does, he kip-ups onto his

789
00:56:38,925 --> 00:56:44,589
feet, as well. Looks at you with a smile, wipes
the snot and blood from the front of his face,

790
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:49,421
licks it off his hand, and with that same hand he
rears back, almost like he's winding up for a

791
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:52,588
punch, and then just kicks you right in the center
of your stomach.

792
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:55,004
TRAVIS: I like the feint, I like the feint.

793
00:56:55,004 --> 00:57:00,991
MATT: That's 22. Yeah, that'll hit. That is eight
points of damage.

794
00:57:00,991 --> 00:57:03,700
ORION: He's fucking strong.

795
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,403
LAURA: You suck, Korn!

796
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:11,518
MATT: That ends his turn now, you're up, Grog.
You're both now standing face-to-face again, you're

797
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:13,987
reeling from the kick to the breadbasket.

798
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:19,872
TRAVIS: You hit me with the knuckle you fucking
licked. So I'd like to jump forward and throw my

799
00:57:19,872 --> 00:57:24,329
knee forward and at the last minute pull it back
and throw my fist in a Superman punch.

800
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:26,697
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll.

801
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:29,488
TRAVIS: Yes, fuck you, 19.

802
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,080
MATT: 19 just barely hits.

803
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,154
TRAVIS: And I'll follow it over with a left-right.
(boom, boom)

804
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:35,578
MATT: Go for it.

805
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:36,984
SAM: Are you still raging?

806
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:41,272
TRAVIS: 21. Oh yeah, frenzied, so I get three. And
22.

807
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:42,573
MATT: All hit.

808
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:46,261
TRAVIS: Outstanding. Watch me roll a six.

809
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:47,907
SAM: (whispers) Should we do something?

810
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:50,811
LIAM: Have an ale. And collect the money.

811
00:57:50,811 --> 00:57:53,625
SAM: I feel like we should do something.

812
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,573
TRAVIS: 16, total.

813
00:57:55,573 --> 00:58:02,987
MATT: Nice. (whack, whack) You first jumped, hit
him in the face. As he stumbles backward, use the

814
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:06,633
inertia to slam him again with the same fist in
the face and then turn around with a full-on

815
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:10,855
haymaker to the side of the temple. (whack) As you
can see, there's a spray of blood and spittle

816
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:15,082
across the, you guys are starting to push towards
the back wall of the Crucible, and he actually

817
00:58:15,082 --> 00:58:25,792
staggers back a little bit towards the wall from
the impact. (cackles) And he charges towards you,

818
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:31,391
putting his head right towards the stomach that he
kicked before, going for that same soft spot he's

819
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:43,783
opened for himself. That's going to be a 20. Yeah,
that hits. 21. And 21. Comes in, slams you into

820
00:58:43,783 --> 00:58:48,560
the middle of your abdomen for seven damage.

821
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,550
SAM: Should I sing?

822
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:59,352
MATT: Eight damage. And then an additional seven.
So that'd be 15, 22 points of damage. As he slams

823
00:58:59,352 --> 00:59:06,403
his head into your midsection, picks you up over
his head, slams you onto the ground, and as you're

824
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:11,766
on the ground, he runs up and soccer-ball kicks
you in the side of your ribs, just (whack). You

825
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:18,157
hear a crack as the impact hits and you can feel
that surging, shooting, burning pain begin to fill

826
00:59:18,157 --> 00:59:21,801
the side of your torso. It's your go.

827
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:25,065
TRAVIS: What else do I have? What can I do?

828
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,374
LAURA: You can throw some dirt in his face!

829
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:34,743
SAM: From the stands, I turn to a portly gentleman
next to me and I say, sir, do you see what that

830
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:44,246
fucking little elf said about your mother? He
called her a name I can't even repeat.

831
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,827
I'm so sorry.

832
00:59:45,827 --> 00:59:48,480
MATT: Go ahead and make a deception check.

833
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,486
LAURA: Was he pointing at you?

834
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,710
SAM: Yes.

835
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,013
LAURA: Oh god.

836
00:59:53,013 --> 00:59:54,906
SAM: 18.

837
00:59:54,906 --> 01:00:02,238
MATT: He looks down at you and looks over at the
elf and he says, "I'll deal with him after the

838
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:04,429
"fight. I've got too much money on this right
now."

839
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:06,467
LIAM: What an asp-hole.

840
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:16,002
TRAVIS: I roll up off of my side and I start to
go, oh, I don't know, it might be too much. And I

841
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:19,577
grab a handful of dirt and I throw it up into his
face.

842
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:27,067
MATT: All right. Riki-oh style. I like it. All
right. So. As you go ahead, go ahead and just roll

843
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:28,561
a basic attack.

844
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:31,586
TRAVIS: Fuck. Thank you, god. 26.

845
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:38,374
MATT: 26. Make a dexterity save on his end-- no,
that won't work. So you throw the dirt up. As he's

846
01:00:38,374 --> 01:00:43,491
rushing towards you to follow up on the attack,
the dirt goes streaming into his eyes and for a

847
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:48,097
second he stumbles and starts trying to wipe his
face. As he does, he has the blood on his hands that's

848
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:52,889
also getting in his eyes, the blood's starting to
cake up a bit, and he's just reaching out in the

849
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:56,584
area. So that's your first attack.

850
01:00:56,584 --> 01:01:03,522
TRAVIS: Because I feel like we have a kinship, I
take my foot and I throw it right up into his

851
01:01:03,522 --> 01:01:06,548
grundle, just soccer-kick the shit out of his
nuts.

852
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:09,177
(laughter)

853
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:12,082
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack. You have
advantage on this currently, because he can't see

854
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:13,203
it coming.

855
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:16,417
TRAVIS: That's even better! 25.

856
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:18,622
MATT: 25. Go ahead and roll damage.

857
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:29,043
TRAVIS: Oh no, I only have two, right? Ten.

858
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:34,481
LAURA: How was that ten, baby? That was 11. The
first one was a five.

859
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:36,741
TRAVIS: Halved. Six.

860
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:38,404
LAURA: That's 11.

861
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:39,873
TRAVIS: 11.

862
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:44,231
MATT: 11.

863
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:46,090
SAM: Baby!

864
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:52,898
MATT: If you're going to do grundle damage. So as
he's reeling and tries to reach out, swiping a

865
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:59,028
back-fist into open air, you rush up and (whack)
hit him with sheer force that you hear a unanimous

866
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:07,442
(groans) in the crowd all around echo down. His
knees immediately bend in towards each other, and

867
01:02:07,442 --> 01:02:12,839
you can see the sound escape instinctively from
him, it's like, (wheezes). As you reel for your

868
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:16,155
second strike, which is going to be? What's the
second one you do?

869
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:17,979
TRAVIS: Well, did he drop to his knees?

870
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:20,004
MATT: No, he's still standing, but barely.

871
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:21,951
TRAVIS: Oh, really? Yeah, same place.

872
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:27,719
MATT: You pull back and (whack) a second time in
the same spot, this sending him onto the ground

873
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:32,027
from behind. He is currently prone. Okay, that's
rough.

874
01:02:32,027 --> 01:02:35,128
TRAVIS: Literally trying to see him cough a
testicle.

875
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:37,372
(laughter)

876
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:41,226
MATT: Well, regardless of what happens, there's
going to be a search.

877
01:02:41,226 --> 01:02:43,998
(laughter)

878
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:49,857
MATT: You're going to need a scouting party to
find where one of them went. So at the top of his

879
01:02:49,857 --> 01:02:57,672
turn, gets up and wipes dirt crust from his eyes,
reeling from the impact. Uses half his movement to

880
01:02:57,672 --> 01:03:04,649
get up and staggers toward you as you're just
welcoming it. Looks up at you for a second and

881
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:12,468
says, "You shouldn't have done that, tall guy." At
which point, he goes and lunges for your

882
01:03:12,468 --> 01:03:19,861
midsection a second time. Misses with that strike,
as you dodge out of the way he spins around and

883
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:32,388
attempts to back-kick you to the torso. That will
hit. A 26. And that one is going to-- That's going

884
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:39,710
to be six points of damage to you from the
back-kick, and as his foot comes down, he's still

885
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:48,371
reaching for his groin from the sheer pain, he
just rushes forward and attempts to bite into your

886
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:51,730
shoulder. That's going to be a 20.

887
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,169
TRAVIS: He rolled a 20?

888
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:58,548
MATT: Not a natural 20. Just a total of 20. He's
rolled a lot of 20s. That's going to be seven

889
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:05,174
damage as he sinks his teeth into the side of your
shoulder and neck area. And tears a chunk of your

890
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:11,006
flesh out of the sides of his mouth, now, in the
muscle. So you reel back in pain and you're both

891
01:04:11,006 --> 01:04:14,265
clutched in this gladiatorial grip. It's your go.

892
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:18,205
TRAVIS: Oh, amazing. Since we're clutched in that
grip, I'll grab him back and I'm going to try and

893
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:19,679
bite his nose off.

894
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,164
SAM: Wait, doesn't he have no nose?

895
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:24,256
TRAVIS: Oh, he's missing a hollow, right?

896
01:04:24,256 --> 01:04:25,694
MATT: It's mashed in.

897
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:33,379
TRAVIS: How about I just aim for this area and if
I catch lip I'll take it as a victory.

898
01:04:33,379 --> 01:04:35,733
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

899
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:39,940
TRAVIS: Yes! Okay, 21.

900
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,289
MATT: That hits.

901
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:47,964
TRAVIS: 20. And 24.

902
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:55,528
MATT: All hit. So as you reach forward, you use
the yell of pain to turn it into an attack, reach

903
01:04:55,528 --> 01:04:59,223
forward and bite into the front of his face. You
don't get any nose, but you do catch the top of

904
01:04:59,223 --> 01:05:05,376
his lip. As you pull back with a snapping sound,
part of his upper lip just comes off in your

905
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:09,174
mouth. How much damage does that do?

906
01:05:09,174 --> 01:05:11,321
MARISHA: It's a souvenir.

907
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:13,695
TRAVIS: The first one is six.

908
01:05:13,695 --> 01:05:16,222
MATT: Six damage. All right. What's your follow-up
attack?

909
01:05:16,222 --> 01:05:18,725
TRAVIS: Would you say that he reaches back for his
face like that in pain?

910
01:05:18,725 --> 01:05:21,611
MATT: Oh yeah, he rears up with his hand right
there and is like, (yelps).

911
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:25,974
TRAVIS: Fantastic. I'd like to just drive my fist
into his throat as his head's arched back.

912
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:28,076
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage on
that.

913
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:32,675
TRAVIS: Yes! Five.

914
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:34,113
MATT: Five, all right.

915
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:39,129
SAM: You know what I love about these fights?
They're beautiful. The beauty of the human body.

916
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:42,229
MATT: The blood's pouring down the front of his
face and his throat. You clip him right in the

917
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:45,791
center of his throat. You hear the coughing sound
as he, with his other hand, reaches up and grabs

918
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:49,536
his throat. You can now see his front teeth
visible through the lip that's no longer there.

919
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:51,511
And what's your third strike?

920
01:05:51,511 --> 01:05:54,620
TRAVIS: Would you say that he bends forward, then,
because he's grabbing his throat like that?

921
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:58,242
MATT: He's tough. He's bending forward, but he's
not completely incapacitated. He's in pain.

922
01:05:58,242 --> 01:06:04,085
TRAVIS: Right, I would say I go up next to him and
invoke a fabled hero that I heard about in the

923
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:08,746
woods named Macho Man Randy Savage, and I
double-tap my elbow and drive it down

924
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:10,039
on top of his head.

925
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,052
MATT: (laughs) All right. Go ahead and roll damage
on this one.

926
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:16,822
TRAVIS: Thank you. Six.

927
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:23,297
MATT: Six. So as you leap up, using the goliath
weight coming down, you double-tap the elbow and

928
01:06:23,297 --> 01:06:30,099
you bring it down on top of his head. He, from the
sheer force of it (wham) slams down face-first

929
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:37,410
into the dirt, just like that. Onto the ground. As
he's getting up, he's looking kind of rough.

930
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:42,077
LIAM: I believe that's pronounced Ma-choman
Rand'Savage.

931
01:06:42,077 --> 01:06:48,619
MATT: There you are. A gracious warrior of the
woods. While on the ground, he reaches forward and

932
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:57,182
attempts to sweep your legs out from under you. Go
ahead and make-- this would be an acrobatics-- no,

933
01:06:57,182 --> 01:07:00,089
we'll make this a dexterity saving throw. Why
not?

934
01:07:00,089 --> 01:07:01,540
TRAVIS: Ten.

935
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:07,282
MATT: Ten. (whoosh) Pulls your legs out from under
you, slams you onto your back. As he leaps up on

936
01:07:07,282 --> 01:07:11,609
top of you immediately and with both of his fists
in the air slams them down towards your face.

937
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:16,140
That's going to be a 22.

938
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,733
TRAVIS: What?

939
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:21,095
MATT: 22 to hit. You take six points of damage.

940
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:24,444
TRAVIS: Oh, good. (laughs) I was thinking 22
points of damage!

941
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:31,676
MATT: And a 23 to hit, it's going to be an
additional eight points of damage. Just once down

942
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:37,253
on your face, and again with a second slam, right
down onto the front of the face again. You can

943
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:41,934
taste all the irony blood and liquid pouring
through your sinuses down into the back of your

944
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:45,808
throat as you're currently on the ground with him
on top of you. You're both looking pretty rough.

945
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:47,374
Where are you at, hit point-wise?

946
01:07:47,374 --> 01:07:51,723
TRAVIS: I say, tastes like home. And I spit in his
face and reach up and

947
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:53,575
thunderclap both of his ears.

948
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:57,092
MATT: (laughs) All right, go ahead and roll for
attack.

949
01:07:57,092 --> 01:07:59,584
TRAVIS: 24.

950
01:07:59,584 --> 01:08:01,065
MATT: Hits.

951
01:08:01,065 --> 01:08:03,554
TRAVIS: 17.

952
01:08:03,554 --> 01:08:05,368
MATT: 17 does not hit.

953
01:08:05,368 --> 01:08:06,951
TRAVIS: 22.

954
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:10,331
MATT: 22 does hit. So you reach up. Go ahead and
roll damage.

955
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:11,609
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, right.

956
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,604
MATT: (whack) Thunderclap to the side of both his
ears.

957
01:08:13,604 --> 01:08:15,091
TRAVIS: Six.

958
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:19,323
MATT: Six points of damage. As he rears back and
instinctively his hands go up and try and grab at

959
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:24,550
your wrists, you pull the wrists back, and he's
holding you from that point. You attempt to go for

960
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:29,703
another strike, but he just redirects it with his
own arms. You manage to pull out of the grip with

961
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:31,461
a third strike. What are you doing for that one?

962
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:37,888
TRAVIS: He pulled away from my wrists, and I'll
give him a little of the same. Put my fists

963
01:08:37,888 --> 01:08:42,647
together and just swing straight down into his
solar plexus since he's sitting on top of me.

964
01:08:42,647 --> 01:08:44,338
MATT: Roll damage.

965
01:08:44,338 --> 01:08:46,682
TRAVIS: That's a five.

966
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:53,872
MATT: Five. (wham) You hit and you hear the wind
out of him from the impact, (wheezes) and he's

967
01:08:53,872 --> 01:08:54,992
trying to get the wind back.

968
01:08:54,992 --> 01:08:56,467
TRAVIS: I can't hear you. What?

969
01:08:56,467 --> 01:09:02,918
MATT: He pushes off of your chest to stand up for
a second and (gasps) gets one big inhale of air,

970
01:09:02,918 --> 01:09:09,313
and as he does, he reaches up his leg and then
tries to curb-stomp kick you right in the stomach

971
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:15,003
while you're still on the ground. That will be
18.

972
01:09:15,003 --> 01:09:16,295
TRAVIS: Misses!

973
01:09:16,295 --> 01:09:18,453
MATT: All right. A 19.

974
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:19,689
TRAVIS: Misses!

975
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:22,205
MATT: And that will be a 24.

976
01:09:22,205 --> 01:09:23,444
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch!

977
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:29,739
MATT: All right. So he goes to kick you once, and
you dodge out of the way. Kick a second time. This

978
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:35,375
time, you catch the foot and hold it in place. He
then lifts up with his other foot to a point where

979
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:39,488
now you're holding him in the air. As he puts all
of his weight in the air, he comes down and slams

980
01:09:39,488 --> 01:09:44,553
his elbow right into the center of your chest, in
the way you did to his head earlier. That's going

981
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:46,375
to be for a total of eight points of damage.

982
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:47,417
TRAVIS: Okay.

983
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,974
LIAM: I take the flagon of ale that I've been
drinking all this time. I slam it down on the

984
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:56,429
ground and push my sister out of the way and yell
at the top of my lungs, Grog! Your father was an

985
01:09:56,429 --> 01:10:00,973
undead piece of shit and your cousin's going to
make you his bitch!

986
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:06,364
TALIESIN: There's not enough popcorn in the world
for this.

987
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:07,391
LAURA: I know.

988
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:14,686
TRAVIS: (growls) I would like to reach forward
with both of my thumbs and shove them into his

989
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:16,554
fucking eye sockets.

990
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:19,594
MATT: Roll an attack.

991
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,715
TRAVIS: Fuck!

992
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:28,401
LAURA: Oh, no. You distracted him.

993
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:31,449
TRAVIS: 12. That's better. 22.

994
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:37,044
MATT: Okay, so as you reach up to try to get his
eyes, he grasps your hands and instead begins

995
01:10:37,044 --> 01:10:42,560
pulling back on the wrists. You can feel the
tension of the bone beginning to bend from the

996
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,517
sheer strength and force of it. As you pull back
your arms, you attempt to headbutt him again and

997
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:51,861
he dodges his head out of the way, and he knows he
has you at an advantageous position. What do you

998
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:53,450
want the third attack to be?

999
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:59,523
TRAVIS: He's still on top of me, isn't he?

1000
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:03,322
MATT: Yeah. Where are you at hit point-wise, by
the way?

1001
01:11:03,322 --> 01:11:05,675
TRAVIS: 18.

1002
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:11,882
MATT: He's looking pretty rough, too. So what do
you want the third attack to be?

1003
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:14,808
TRAVIS: Would you say he's on my chest?

1004
01:11:14,808 --> 01:11:18,930
MATT: He's currently on your chest and waist area
right now, like (grunts) holding you down.

1005
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:30,186
TRAVIS: I was going to grapple him, but if he's on
my chest, I'll use my thighs to shove him up

1006
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:36,404
towards the upper part of my body and I'll drive
down my elbow at the same time. Into that whole

1007
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:38,316
bloody target area.

1008
01:11:38,316 --> 01:11:41,515
MATT: (laughs) Okay. As you shift upward, you
bring your elbow forward. Roll for attack.

1009
01:11:41,515 --> 01:11:45,779
SAM: No, he rolled three already.

1010
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:46,898
MATT: Oh, that's right.

1011
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:48,914
TRAVIS: I got at least a six.

1012
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:54,528
MATT: So six damage? Okay, as you position him up,
(whack) the elbow hits, and you can feel it sink

1013
01:11:54,528 --> 01:12:01,306
in. What bones are there are mostly splintered and
broken, and you get a good inch into his face with

1014
01:12:01,306 --> 01:12:07,320
your elbow. As you pull back, he's looking really
rough, and one of his eyes is beginning to swell

1015
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,436
entirely shut.

1016
01:12:08,436 --> 01:12:10,184
TRAVIS: We look like a Rocky movie right now.

1017
01:12:10,184 --> 01:12:12,413
MATT: Yeah. This is a full-on, drag-out fight.

1018
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:13,895
TRAVIS: I must break you!

1019
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:19,601
MATT: He angrily looks down at you, (snarls) and
he reaches both of his hands up again in a giant

1020
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:23,797
hammer fashion. That's going to be a 17?

1021
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:24,900
TRAVIS: Misses.

1022
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,493
MATT: A 20.

1023
01:12:26,493 --> 01:12:27,517
TRAVIS: Hits.

1024
01:12:27,517 --> 01:12:29,373
MATT: And a 15.

1025
01:12:29,373 --> 01:12:30,379
TRAVIS: Misses!

1026
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:34,892
MATT: So he brings it down. (wham) As it hits, you
manage to take the brunt of it in the shoulder.

1027
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:40,193
The second hit comes down and slams you for eight
points of damage. (wham) This one, you can feel

1028
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:45,922
the sternum crack. As he brings up his fists a
third time, attempting to end this, you use the

1029
01:12:45,922 --> 01:12:50,788
leverage you had when you pushed him up to
actually spring your entire body upward and force

1030
01:12:50,788 --> 01:12:55,495
him off you. He manages to get to his feet and you
just get up and you both are bleeding from all

1031
01:12:55,495 --> 01:13:02,352
over your faces with giant bruises, and both of
you are barely holding yourselves up, breathing

1032
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:04,111
heavily. It's your go.

1033
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:09,344
TRAVIS: I'm going to rush at him, spit on my
knuckles, swing back, and at the last second, take

1034
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,795
my right foot and drive it right through his
kneecap.

1035
01:13:11,795 --> 01:13:14,472
MATT: Roll for attack.

1036
01:13:14,472 --> 01:13:18,169
TRAVIS: Fuck you! Yes! 24.

1037
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:19,633
MATT: 24 hits.

1038
01:13:19,633 --> 01:13:21,165
TRAVIS: 22.

1039
01:13:21,165 --> 01:13:22,471
MATT: 22.

1040
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:23,768
TRAVIS: 19?

1041
01:13:23,768 --> 01:13:25,274
MATT: 19 just barely hits.

1042
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:27,308
(cheering)

1043
01:13:27,308 --> 01:13:31,957
MATT: All right, so as you run forward, bring the
leg up, (whack) you hit the side of the knee.

1044
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:33,173
Roll damage.

1045
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:34,603
SAM: Come on, roll good.

1046
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:38,949
TRAVIS: Five. Six. Six.

1047
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:41,300
MATT: All right, and what are the attacks you do?

1048
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,736
TRAVIS: I want to drive my foot through his
kneecap.

1049
01:13:43,736 --> 01:13:50,361
MATT: It snaps. He's still standing on the other
leg, but the knee is cracked behind.

1050
01:13:50,361 --> 01:13:53,105
TRAVIS: Oh, that's amazing. I'll just put my foot
through his other knee.

1051
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:57,348
MATT: As you jump off the other one, (whack) it
catches the knee. It doesn't snap, but you can see

1052
01:13:57,348 --> 01:14:01,965
there is a bend to it, and then he falls to the
ground, on both of his busted knees now, looking

1053
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:04,914
up at you. And with the third strike, what are you
going to do?

1054
01:14:04,914 --> 01:14:09,016
TRAVIS: I would like to grab his head, since he's
probably kneeling on the ground at this point,

1055
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:17,841
right? And say, there's only room for one to rage
in this pit. And I take it, and I just smash into

1056
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:22,337
the top of his jaw, hopefully dislocating the
bloody, lipless face that I see.

1057
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,674
MATT: Okay.

1058
01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:27,220
TRAVIS: Wait, is he an orc?

1059
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,379
MATT: He's a half-orc.

1060
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:30,399
TRAVIS: As a half-orc, does he got those big
teeth?

1061
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,611
MATT: There are little tusks there, yeah.

1062
01:14:31,611 --> 01:14:33,143
TRAVIS: I'll grab onto those.

1063
01:14:33,143 --> 01:14:42,549
MATT: They're small to pull. You slam down on his
face. (crunch) You can see the jaw crack open. The

1064
01:14:42,549 --> 01:14:46,408
tongue instinctively moves around a little, but
the jaw is definitely broken from the impact.

1065
01:14:46,408 --> 01:14:50,449
SAM: It's like a dance! It's like a beautiful
dance.

1066
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:56,099
MATT: You can see, that blow should have taken him
out, because there was nothing left.

1067
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:59,449
TRAVIS: He's like the Black Knight in Monty
Python! He's got no knees!

1068
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:04,867
MATT: His body goes limp for a brief second. You
can see the half-orc rage kicks in. That

1069
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:10,976
half-orc's blood. You can see him now rally up for
one final round of vengeance against you, Grog.

1070
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:17,443
Reaches up and grabs you by the throat and brings
you up to slam into his head. This is going to be

1071
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:24,117
a 21. A 17.

1072
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:25,386
SAM: Miss.

1073
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:32,257
MATT: And a 22. So grabs you, slams into your head
with the first strike. That is going to be six

1074
01:15:32,257 --> 01:15:38,332
points of damage. (boom) Into the face. You can
feel like the shock, the white light in your eyes

1075
01:15:38,332 --> 01:15:43,051
as the impact smashes into you. He goes to do it a
second time. This time you instinctively reach

1076
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:48,898
down with your hands and push his face away. You
can feel the fading just from the sheer impact as

1077
01:15:48,898 --> 01:15:54,980
he pushes you up onto your feet again and you step
back. And he takes a moment to look at you with

1078
01:15:54,980 --> 01:16:09,272
his missing lip, his bashed-in nose, eye swollen
shut, both knees messed up. (pants) "Respect." And

1079
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:14,873
then he runs forward and with one heaping haymaker
just takes you in the face with a cracking sound

1080
01:16:14,873 --> 01:16:17,275
for six points of damage.

1081
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:21,444
(groaning)

1082
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:30,074
MATT: With a resounding crack Grog's head spins,
his body turning. He stumbles a couple of steps,

1083
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:39,727
falls to one knee, face-down in the dirt,
unconscious. The whole crowd raises and cheers,

1084
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:51,157
(cheering) as the mostly broken half-orc raises
one of its fists to the air, walks around, looks

1085
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:57,693
over to your body, reaches into his pocket and
flicks a gold coin onto your back. Walks over to

1086
01:16:57,693 --> 01:17:03,778
the ladder and begins very painfully making his
way up to the edge of the Crucible.

1087
01:17:03,778 --> 01:17:07,081
LAURA: Yeah, he's only using his arms because he's
got no knees! Douche.

1088
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:14,394
MATT: Getting up to the top, the crowd cheers. You
can now see one of the bookies reveals a holy

1089
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:17,993
symbol, one that you recognize as the symbol of
Kord, and he goes down and immediately begins

1090
01:17:17,993 --> 01:17:27,069
administering, healing to our recently unconscious
Grog. You can see the other bookie, who is dressed

1091
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:36,182
similarly in the purplish robes you saw before,
also begins to heal our good fighting half-orc

1092
01:17:36,182 --> 01:17:43,709
friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of
coins from him. The clerics of Kord are the ones

1093
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:52,447
actually running this, it looks like. You come to
in the pit, Grog, beaten, wearied, and fatigued

1094
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:59,147
because of your frenzied rage. However, you have
been defeated in the Crucible.

1095
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:02,574
LAURA: That was painful.

1096
01:18:02,574 --> 01:18:04,643
MATT: That was so close.

1097
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:13,684
SAM: I go down and nurse him, nurse his head, hold
him, and just tell him, Grog, you won!

1098
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:17,248
You did it, buddy!

1099
01:18:17,248 --> 01:18:19,909
MATT: Make a deception roll.

1100
01:18:19,909 --> 01:18:23,359
SAM: 16.

1101
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:32,781
MATT: I would say given the circumstances, it's
nice that he's trying, but it's been a while since

1102
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:39,974
you've been bested in one-on-one combat, and a
part of you is deeply hurt by it. But at the same

1103
01:18:39,974 --> 01:18:50,176
time, there is that burning fire, that need to
come back and vengefully tear him down from his

1104
01:18:50,176 --> 01:18:52,303
precipice when you're ready.

1105
01:18:52,303 --> 01:18:54,703
TRAVIS: I say nothing.

1106
01:18:54,703 --> 01:19:01,225
ORION: It's okay, buddy. This isn't the first time
you've been knocked unconscious.

1107
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:06,714
LAURA: It's too bad Pike didn't cast Death Ward on
him before she left, though.

1108
01:19:06,714 --> 01:19:08,085
That would've been great.

1109
01:19:08,085 --> 01:19:12,722
MARISHA: I go up and rub on him and (meows).

1110
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:19,238
MATT: As you're being tended to by your party, the
same bookie that brought you in comes over and

1111
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:26,899
taps you on the shoulder and says, "Not going to
lie, no one has taken a beating from the Hammer

1112
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:35,053
"like that and brought him so close. I don't think
he's going to be able to take another round with

1113
01:19:35,053 --> 01:19:40,587
"you for at least a few days. But you're welcome to
fight in my ring any time you wish."

1114
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:43,966
LAURA: We'll need to earn our money back.

1115
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:46,099
MATT: "There is that, yes."

1116
01:19:46,099 --> 01:19:49,756
ORION: Or you could just give it to us.

1117
01:19:49,756 --> 01:19:54,083
TRAVIS: I walk away.

1118
01:19:54,083 --> 01:20:01,004
LAURA: Is there a whorehouse here in Vasselheim?

1119
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:04,118
ORION: You're asking this question?

1120
01:20:04,118 --> 01:20:08,614
MATT: A curious laugh comes across the bookie's
face and he says,

1121
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:21,176
"The third floor of the Bellows'--" 
What did I call it, again?

1122
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:22,713
SAM: The Bellows' Respite.

1123
01:20:22,713 --> 01:20:27,170
MATT: The Bellows' Respite. Sorry, I was in the
moment. "The third floor of the Bellows' Respite

1124
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:30,675
"does itself run as a brothel, if that's what
you're inquiring."

1125
01:20:30,675 --> 01:20:32,195
LAURA: That is what I was inquiring.

1126
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:34,002
TALIESIN: Come on, Grog, we'll get you ice cream.

1127
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:37,157
LAURA: We'll get you ice cream, Grog, and a whore.
How's that sound?

1128
01:20:37,157 --> 01:20:38,397
LIAM: Coldstone?

1129
01:20:38,397 --> 01:20:42,561
ORION: Grog, you can eat the ice cream from the
whore.

1130
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:44,594
LAURA: Tiberius, really?

1131
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:50,251
ORION: I'm trying to be creative here. Make him
feel good. Fireworks. Prestidigitation.

1132
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:57,003
MATT: All right. Grog, as you make your way into
the tavern, there is, though in your solemn state

1133
01:20:57,003 --> 01:21:00,819
you can see a number of the patrons who were
watching from the inside who were part of the

1134
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:10,295
crowd all give a round of applause to you as you
enter. The barkeep who turns to you, a human

1135
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:18,847
fellow who's missing one eye, has a tufted, spotty
beard and happily extends a large tankard of ale

1136
01:21:18,847 --> 01:21:22,792
and says, "On the house for you, friend! You
fought well tonight."

1137
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:26,088
TRAVIS: I like your beard.

1138
01:21:26,088 --> 01:21:33,244
LIAM: I take five of my remaining gold and slide
it over to that bartender and say, just keep it

1139
01:21:33,244 --> 01:21:36,741
coming. All night, please. Thanks.

1140
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:39,063
MATT: "I'll deliver it to the room. By the way,
what room are you staying in?"

1141
01:21:39,063 --> 01:21:40,554
SAM: Do we have a room?

1142
01:21:40,554 --> 01:21:41,796
LAURA: We would love one of those.

1143
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,203
LIAM: The third floor, I believe.

1144
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:44,709
LAURA: For some of us, not all of us.

1145
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:47,903
SAM: I don't think he's going to want to...
partake tonight.

1146
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,531
LIAM: Might have problems.

1147
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:57,134
SAM: Aw, he's chugging. He's sadness-chugging.

1148
01:21:57,134 --> 01:22:01,863
MATT: "The rest of you, how many rooms you taking?
Three amongst you?"

1149
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:02,849
SAM: Three.

1150
01:22:02,849 --> 01:22:04,638
MATT: "Three rooms for the night."

1151
01:22:04,638 --> 01:22:08,029
SAM: Plus a stable for our bear.

1152
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:11,273
LAURA: No. Our bear will stay in the room with us
girls.

1153
01:22:11,273 --> 01:22:15,247
TRAVIS: It looked like rain, right? I'll be out
there with the pigs.

1154
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:17,322
LAURA: No, Grog.

1155
01:22:17,322 --> 01:22:20,347
SAM: No, it's okay, he needs to stew in this for a
while.

1156
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:25,770
MATT: "Your room's on the house, friend. The rest
of you, that'll be six gold for the evening."

1157
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,081
ORION: I'll stay in your room, Grog.

1158
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:30,102
SAM: I don't think he wants company tonight.

1159
01:22:30,102 --> 01:22:32,386
ORION: No, he can sleep with the pigs. I'll stay
in the free room.

1160
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:38,017
MATT: So that's six gold for them. All right, so
mark off your losses for the money

1161
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:39,654
you put in for the pot.

1162
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,935
TRAVIS: Where do I mark off my loss of pride?

1163
01:22:41,935 --> 01:22:44,796
MATT: That would be under additional notes.

1164
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:48,270
SAM: I almost won.

1165
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,936
TALIESIN: Damn it.

1166
01:22:49,936 --> 01:22:51,052
LAURA: Almost.

1167
01:22:51,052 --> 01:22:55,605
TRAVIS: What did he have, that orc piece of shit,
he had what that made him come back?

1168
01:22:55,605 --> 01:22:59,002
MATT: It's a half-orc racial ability that the
first time they're dropped to zero hit points,

1169
01:22:59,002 --> 01:23:02,186
they can instead choose to be at one hit point.
They can only do it once per day.

1170
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,833
TRAVIS: He had one left?!

1171
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:07,149
MATT: You brought him to negative five on that
final hit, but that half-orc racial ability...

1172
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,784
TRAVIS: That's even worse!

1173
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:12,352
LIAM: Grog, if it's any consolation--

1174
01:23:12,352 --> 01:23:13,833
TRAVIS: What's that mean?

1175
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:16,362
TALIESIN: It's a grouping of stars in the sky.

1176
01:23:16,362 --> 01:23:21,171
LIAM: As I had no idea that weapons weren't
allowed in there, if you and I had fought, you

1177
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:24,717
would've beaten me to a bloody paste.

1178
01:23:24,717 --> 01:23:29,773
TRAVIS: Oh, you weren't serious, were you? I
thought you were being funny.

1179
01:23:29,773 --> 01:23:32,886
(laughter)

1180
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:34,102
TRAVIS: Oh.

1181
01:23:34,102 --> 01:23:36,642
SAM: There's a lot of injured pride tonight.

1182
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:40,816
MARISHA: Guys, we've had a really emotional day.
Can we just sleep?

1183
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,199
ORION: I found it to be very entertaining.

1184
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:50,221
SAM: Hey, does anyone want to come to my room and
look through my shit to see how Pike's doing?

1185
01:23:50,221 --> 01:23:52,063
LAURA: Okay, yeah!

1186
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:54,948
ORION: Let's look through your shit. Scanlan.

1187
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:58,349
LIAM: Pike would have been proud of you, Grog.

1188
01:23:58,349 --> 01:24:04,774
TRAVIS: Thank you. And if there had been weapons
I'd be in deep shit. I'll be at the bar.

1189
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:07,235
LAURA: Oh, Grog, come on.

1190
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:10,244
SAM: That's not even chicken, that's just a piece
of wood.

1191
01:24:10,244 --> 01:24:14,916
(laughter)

1192
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:21,461
MATT: And yet it doesn't stop him as he, bite by
bite, makes his way through the piece of driftwood

1193
01:24:21,461 --> 01:24:23,963
he found by the bar.

1194
01:24:23,963 --> 01:24:28,037
LIAM: I slap down another five gold to the
bartender and say, that's for that barstool.

1195
01:24:28,037 --> 01:24:40,045
MATT: "Thank you." Which, the barstools, by the
way, have a thick, crusty wool on them, so there's

1196
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:42,810
a unique flavor to the piece you've chewed
through.

1197
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,150
TRAVIS: The frying on this chicken is exquisite.

1198
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:51,553
MATT: As you all take your evening of rest in your
respective groups, Grog, eating and drinking away

1199
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:57,513
your worries until eventually you are unable to
make conversation, you sloppily make your way to

1200
01:24:57,513 --> 01:25:04,111
the third floor to a room in the brothel that has
been prepared and awaiting for you, paid for by

1201
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:14,772
the Bellows' Respite, and you find yourself
sloppily disappointing a woman until you pass out

1202
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:16,535
in your own sorrow.

1203
01:25:16,535 --> 01:25:19,025
(laughter)

1204
01:25:19,025 --> 01:25:25,481
MATT: And with that, we're going to take a quick
break, but we'll be back here in about ten

1205
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:29,692
minutes, guys, right after Overlord has a few.

1206
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:31,381
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1207
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:34,142
LAURA: He's so upset. He's really upset.

1208
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:36,921
MARISHA: I've never seen him this upset.

1209
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:39,207
ORION: Yeah, isn't it weird when other people get
upset?

1210
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:46,114
ZAC: He's definitely not a challenge for Overlord
status, that's for sure. Guys, so in case you're

1211
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:51,533
wondering what all of this 5k hype is that you
keep seeing, if you're watching from home and you

1212
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:58,041
tuned in after we started. Megiyama in the
chatroom has challenged you guys, the audience, if

1213
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:04,939
we get up to 5,000 subscribers tonight, he will
buy a very large, and by very large I mean eight

1214
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:11,361
feet tall. It is massive. He sent me a picture; it
is massive, I don't know where we will put it.

1215
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:20,268
We'll figure it out somehow. He will buy that for
us and ship it to us, it's a very, very generous

1216
01:26:20,268 --> 01:26:28,645
thing to help get us to 5,000 subscribers, and I
was told from some people in the chat that I

1217
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:35,521
should also contribute in some way, shape, or
form, so I have agreed to dress up as Pengulord

1218
01:26:35,521 --> 01:26:42,084
tomorrow all day if we reach this goal. And for
those who don't know, there was a very large war

1219
01:26:42,084 --> 01:26:48,093
this morning in team No Stream, the chatroom,
while we were offline. Someone thought it would be

1220
01:26:48,093 --> 01:26:52,679
funny to put my face on a penguin. I did not think
it was funny, and I timed out and banned every

1221
01:26:52,679 --> 01:27:00,673
single person that referenced it, and exalted all
of my power as Overlord, so it pains me to agree

1222
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:07,195
to do this, very much so, because it completely
diminishes everything I've strived so hard for in

1223
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:10,531
world domination. Penguins are the
least-threatening animals on the planet,

1224
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:11,635
and I despise them.

1225
01:27:11,635 --> 01:27:17,117
MATT: Wow, that is an intensity. Pengulord, guys.

1226
01:27:17,117 --> 01:27:18,559
ZAC: Good for you guys.

1227
01:27:18,559 --> 01:27:22,518
MATT: Pengulord, I like the sound of that.

1228
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:24,001
MARISHA: They like to snuggle.

1229
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:26,415
ZAC: Well, good for them. No.

1230
01:27:26,415 --> 01:27:29,096
MATT: We could fit Pengulord on a license plate,
right?

1231
01:27:29,096 --> 01:27:31,993
ZAC: No. Too many letters.

1232
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:35,354
TALIESIN: If we get you in this outfit, will you
waddle? That's really the question.

1233
01:27:35,354 --> 01:27:41,236
ZAC: I said 5,000 subs, not my dignity and
everything. I will put on the damn outfit at

1234
01:27:41,236 --> 01:27:46,244
5,000. That's all I have to offer. I'm already
still working on a damn music video, so all I have

1235
01:27:46,244 --> 01:27:50,245
left to offer is my dignity and every ounce of
pride I have in anything.

1236
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:57,153
MATT: So if we somehow get to 5,000 subscribers,
we get an eight-foot Trinket and Pengulord gets to

1237
01:27:57,153 --> 01:28:02,377
rule the stream tomorrow. We'll be back in about
five, ten minutes, guys, please stick around, we

1238
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:05,100
have more interesting things to see.

1239
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:11,766
MARISHA: Oh wait, before we log off, we have this
ready to go. Follow our amazing artists. Also,

1240
01:28:11,766 --> 01:28:17,096
follow Espionage Cosmetics because they're amazing
supporters of the show. Tweet at them and be like,

1241
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:28,276
thank you so much for supporting Critical Role.
Because they're awesome. Okay.

1242
01:28:28,276 --> 01:29:36,402

01:29:36,402 --> 01:29:44,369
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

1244
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:51,946
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

1245
01:29:51,946 --> 01:29:56,435
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

1246
01:29:56,435 --> 01:29:57,911
(record scratch) Wait.

1247
01:29:57,911 --> 01:30:04,498
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

1248
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:07,508
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

1249
01:30:07,508 --> 01:30:09,464
Also ale.

1250
01:30:09,464 --> 01:30:15,547
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

1251
01:30:15,547 --> 01:30:22,125
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

1252
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:30,226
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

1253
01:30:30,226 --> 01:30:35,235
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing.

1254
01:30:35,235 --> 01:30:38,820
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

1255
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:47,178
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

1256
01:30:47,178 --> 01:30:54,116
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

1257
01:30:54,116 --> 01:31:02,108
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

1258
01:31:02,108 --> 01:31:07,369
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

1259
01:31:07,369 --> 01:31:14,743
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

1260
01:31:14,743 --> 01:31:20,547
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

1261
01:31:20,547 --> 01:31:22,910
Also ale!

1262
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:27,758
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

1263
01:31:27,758 --> 01:31:32,632
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

1264
01:31:32,632 --> 01:31:34,619
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

1265
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:41,466
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

1266
01:31:41,466 --> 01:31:47,297
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

1267
01:31:47,297 --> 01:31:52,643
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

1268
01:31:52,643 --> 01:31:58,483
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

1269
01:31:58,483 --> 01:32:04,466
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

1270
01:32:04,466 --> 01:32:08,675
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

1271
01:32:08,675 --> 01:32:13,890
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

1272
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:21,264
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

1273
01:32:21,264 --> 01:32:27,334
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

1274
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:32,596
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

1275
01:32:32,596 --> 01:32:38,788
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

1276
01:32:38,788 --> 01:32:44,976
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

1277
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:50,590
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

1278
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:57,403
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

1279
01:32:57,403 --> 01:33:03,341
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

1280
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:05,052
will ever return.

1281
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:10,569
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

1282
01:33:10,569 --> 01:33:16,839
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

1283
01:33:16,839 --> 01:33:26,536
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

1284
01:33:26,536 --> 01:33:32,482
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

1285
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:38,493
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

1286
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:42,677
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

1287
01:33:42,677 --> 01:33:49,568
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

1288
01:33:49,568 --> 01:33:55,310
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

1289
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:57,393
would stand in their way.

1290
01:33:57,393 --> 01:34:03,377
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

1291
01:34:03,377 --> 01:34:09,109
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

1292
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:15,679
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

1293
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,921
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

1294
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:25,448
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

1295
01:34:25,448 --> 01:34:32,262
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

1296
01:34:32,262 --> 01:34:40,048
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

1297
01:34:40,048 --> 01:34:46,885
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

1298
01:34:46,885 --> 01:34:52,476
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

1299
01:34:52,476 --> 01:34:58,636
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

1300
01:34:58,636 --> 01:35:03,646
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

1301
01:35:03,646 --> 01:35:09,703
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

1302
01:35:09,703 --> 01:35:15,504
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

1303
01:35:15,504 --> 01:35:18,257
life of service and devotion.

1304
01:35:18,257 --> 01:35:25,021
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

1305
01:35:25,021 --> 01:35:31,098
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

1306
01:35:31,098 --> 01:35:34,531
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

1307
01:35:34,531 --> 01:35:41,022
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

1308
01:35:41,022 --> 01:35:46,349
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

1309
01:35:46,349 --> 01:35:53,778
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

1310
01:35:53,778 --> 01:35:58,510
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could,

1311
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:01,041
bringing him back to life.

1312
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:08,971
When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog
Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends,

1313
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:15,657
a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that
in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

1314
01:36:15,657 --> 01:36:22,526
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. (roar, crunch)

1315
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:27,576
After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She
wanted to be stronger so that it would never

1316
01:36:27,576 --> 01:36:33,172
happen again. She spent four months at sea
training with the men and women aboard a ship

1317
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:35,396
called the Broken Howl.

1318
01:36:35,396 --> 01:36:41,072
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her
morningstar in the other, this time,

1319
01:36:41,072 --> 01:36:43,937
Pike is ready.

1320
01:36:43,937 --> 01:36:50,028
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

1321
01:36:50,028 --> 01:36:51,522
eye on you.

1322
01:36:51,522 --> 01:36:57,248
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

1323
01:36:57,248 --> 01:37:00,963
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

1324
01:37:00,963 --> 01:37:06,923
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

1325
01:37:06,923 --> 01:37:12,547
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr.

1326
01:37:12,547 --> 01:37:18,613
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world and honed his skills

1327
01:37:18,613 --> 01:37:21,025
as a bard extraordinaire.

1328
01:37:21,025 --> 01:37:26,296
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

1329
01:37:26,296 --> 01:37:31,779
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

1330
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:38,144
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

1331
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:42,217
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

1332
01:37:42,217 --> 01:37:49,323
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

1333
01:37:49,323 --> 01:37:54,375
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to

1334
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,910
protect fellow gnome, Pike.

1335
01:37:56,910 --> 01:38:02,244
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

1336
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:06,344
and makes the females swoon.

1337
01:38:06,344 --> 01:38:13,564
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

1338
01:38:13,564 --> 01:38:16,389
located in the heart of Draconia.

1339
01:38:16,389 --> 01:38:21,774
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

1340
01:38:21,774 --> 01:38:26,785
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

1341
01:38:26,785 --> 01:38:31,866
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

1342
01:38:31,866 --> 01:38:37,414
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

1343
01:38:37,414 --> 01:38:41,552
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

1344
01:38:41,552 --> 01:38:47,782
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

1345
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:52,703
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

1346
01:38:52,703 --> 01:38:56,045
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

1347
01:38:56,045 --> 01:39:00,976
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

1348
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:05,365
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

1349
01:39:05,365 --> 01:39:11,502
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

1350
01:39:11,502 --> 01:39:14,496
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

1351
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:19,286
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

1352
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:23,851
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

1353
01:39:23,851 --> 01:39:29,295
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

1354
01:39:29,295 --> 01:39:34,784
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

1355
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:39,752
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

1356
01:39:39,752 --> 01:39:45,909
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

1357
01:39:45,909 --> 01:39:51,306
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

1358
01:39:51,306 --> 01:39:59,170
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

1359
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:05,004
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

1360
01:40:05,004 --> 01:40:10,713
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

1361
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:15,894
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

1362
01:40:15,894 --> 01:40:22,587
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

1363
01:40:22,587 --> 01:40:28,067
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

1364
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:33,117
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves--

1365
01:40:33,117 --> 01:40:37,843
MATT: Welcome back, guys. All right, so we had a
little break here. Remember to follow our awesome

1366
01:40:37,843 --> 01:40:45,256
artists on the Twitter. So, let's go ahead and get
back to the game so we can-- we have a lot to do

1367
01:40:45,256 --> 01:40:53,198
tonight. All right. As morning comes to, the rest
of you wake up, the first thought, of course, being

1368
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:58,491
the heartache for your friend Grog, who is not in
any of the rooms.

1369
01:40:58,491 --> 01:41:00,958
LAURA: The heartache for our lost money.

1370
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:08,683
MATT: Yeah, more the money probably for Vex-- but
as you wake up, Grog is nowhere to be found in

1371
01:41:08,683 --> 01:41:14,517
your rooms, of course. He wandered off to
presumably the third floor.

1372
01:41:14,517 --> 01:41:17,050
TALIESIN: Is that a euphemism?

1373
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,193
MATT: It can be.

1374
01:41:19,193 --> 01:41:27,230
MARISHA: I'm still in Minxie form. I slept in
Minxie form. I'm going to go look for him, see if

1375
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:29,688
I can find him in any of the rooms on the third
floor.

1376
01:41:29,688 --> 01:41:41,836
MATT: Okay. A giant white saber-toothed tiger
wandering the interior does set off a few minds. I

1377
01:41:41,836 --> 01:41:46,547
mean, an armored bear being escorted is one thing,
but a lone saber-toothed tiger? As soon as you

1378
01:41:46,547 --> 01:41:49,113
make your way through the hallway, you can see one
of the patrons comes out of the room and goes,

1379
01:41:49,113 --> 01:41:54,038
(startled sound) and goes and pulls his blade out,
like, "Help! Help, there's a tiger!

1380
01:41:54,038 --> 01:41:55,679
"There's a tiger in the inn!"

1381
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,612
MARISHA: Why does this always happen to me?

1382
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:03,403
LIAM: Hearing yelling, I run up the stairs and
say, hey, has anyone seen a-- oh, there you are.

1383
01:42:03,403 --> 01:42:06,745
Come on, Snibbles, come on. We've got to go back
downstairs.

1384
01:42:06,745 --> 01:42:08,900
MATT: "Hey, keep that thing on a leash, sir."

1385
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:10,288
LIAM: I'm really sorry.

1386
01:42:10,288 --> 01:42:11,711
MATT: "Liable to kill someone!"

1387
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:14,530
LIAM: Chews through her rope all the time. Come
on, Snibbles.

1388
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:18,822
MARISHA: I roll over on my back, and I'm like
those cats you see on YouTube who hate being on

1389
01:42:18,822 --> 01:42:22,277
leashes. Just dragging.

1390
01:42:22,277 --> 01:42:24,782
LIAM: I start going, on the tummy.

1391
01:42:24,782 --> 01:42:27,155
MATT: Goes back in his room and closes the door.

1392
01:42:27,155 --> 01:42:30,558
LAURA: I'm pretty sure you just groped her.

1393
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:38,353
MATT: At about this time, you hear a heavy
footfall. A second heavy footfall. A third heavy

1394
01:42:38,353 --> 01:42:42,210
footfall. And from around the corner of the
staircase, descending from the third floor, you

1395
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:48,933
see a very hungover and expressionless Grog
squinting and making his way down.

1396
01:42:48,933 --> 01:42:58,175
LIAM: Morning, big guy. Have fun last night?

1397
01:42:58,175 --> 01:43:02,211
MARISHA: God. You're not going to puke, are you?

1398
01:43:02,211 --> 01:43:05,112
MATT: You hear (meowing).

1399
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:08,216
TRAVIS: I never puke.

1400
01:43:08,216 --> 01:43:12,302
LAURA: Do you need some breakfast or ale?

1401
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:18,530
TRAVIS: What, food? I think I'm good.

1402
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,967
LAURA: All right.

1403
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:21,648
LIAM: I think you need an ale.

1404
01:43:21,648 --> 01:43:24,763
LAURA: Little hair of the dog? Yeah?

1405
01:43:24,763 --> 01:43:27,648
TRAVIS: Now that sounds like a plan.

1406
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:28,841
LAURA: All right.

1407
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:32,793
MATT: You guys head down. The rest of you manage
to eventually wake and make your way down to the

1408
01:43:32,793 --> 01:43:36,697
tavern, where Grog is already in the process of
consuming his liquid breakfast.

1409
01:43:36,697 --> 01:43:41,538
ORION: Hold on, I haven't come out of the room
yet, right?

1410
01:43:41,538 --> 01:43:43,430
MATT: Not until you want to.

1411
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:48,311
ORION: So I do, I see Grog going there, drinking
his thing, I use my Mage Hand and I whack the ale

1412
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:51,635
out of his hand.

1413
01:43:51,635 --> 01:43:55,776
MATT: Your tankard goes flying out of your hand,
on the ground, it spills across the front--

1414
01:43:55,776 --> 01:44:03,300
ORION: I make my way down to the thing and I tell
the bartender, give this warrior water. This might

1415
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,765
be your problem, Grog. You lost for a reason, and
you're a warrior.

1416
01:44:06,765 --> 01:44:09,702
LIAM: Yes, but he's named after beer.

1417
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:11,270
(laughter)

1418
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,897
ORION: Yes, I know that, Vax. I'm just saying.

1419
01:44:13,897 --> 01:44:15,470
TALIESIN: And you are what you eat.

1420
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:19,247
ORION: I cast Invisibility.

1421
01:44:19,247 --> 01:44:26,428
MATT: Okay. Tiberius vanishes. The barkeep hands
over a big mug of clear water

1422
01:44:26,428 --> 01:44:27,771
and sets it in front of Grog.

1423
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:29,669
LAURA: Oh, this is the very special beer.

1424
01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:35,009
MATT: "It's the water that was requested by your
friend. Who disappeared."

1425
01:44:35,009 --> 01:44:36,748
TRAVIS: Water?

1426
01:44:36,748 --> 01:44:41,649
LAURA: It'll get you super drunk.

1427
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:45,758
LIAM: Can you feel it? You can feel it, right? You
can totally feel it.

1428
01:44:45,758 --> 01:44:47,300
TRAVIS: It's pretty smooth.

1429
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,874
(laughter)

1430
01:44:49,874 --> 01:44:55,204
TRAVIS: Keep it coming.

1431
01:44:55,204 --> 01:45:03,333
MATT: Meals are ordered, you guys are fed as per
your purchase of the evening's inn stay. Your

1432
01:45:03,333 --> 01:45:09,297
meal's still covered by the tavern. Eventually,
you find yourselves full and about, I'll say

1433
01:45:09,297 --> 01:45:11,284
roughly ten, 11 in the morning it would be.

1434
01:45:11,284 --> 01:45:15,610
MARISHA: I'm no longer Minxie to eat breakfast
with my friends.

1435
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,685
MATT: Okay.

1436
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:18,494
LAURA: Hi, good to see you, Keyleth.

1437
01:45:18,494 --> 01:45:19,832
LIAM: Are you a dwarf again?

1438
01:45:19,832 --> 01:45:26,799
MARISHA: No. I should to talk to more dwarves
before I try to... yeah.

1439
01:45:26,799 --> 01:45:29,758
TALIESIN: That was a little racist.

1440
01:45:29,758 --> 01:45:31,248
MARISHA: It was a little racist.

1441
01:45:31,248 --> 01:45:35,533
SAM: Remind me, what was on our plate? What's on
our plate?

1442
01:45:35,533 --> 01:45:41,940
LAURA: Well, we have multiple things we can be
doing. We can go meet Keyleth's druid family in

1443
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:48,545
the mountains, right? Fire, brimstone, stuff like
that. We have a lot of money waiting for us.

1444
01:45:48,545 --> 01:45:52,056
TRAVIS: I think we have to go back on the airship
to go get it.

1445
01:45:52,056 --> 01:45:56,817
LAURA: In Kraghammer, yes, but there is 25,000
gold waiting for us, so that's always an option.

1446
01:45:56,817 --> 01:46:05,664
TRAVIS: The Braving Grounds, we could see if they
need any-- since we-- I lost us

1447
01:46:05,664 --> 01:46:09,533
a lot of (tearing up) money.

1448
01:46:09,533 --> 01:46:12,889
LAURA: Here, Grog. Have some clear beer.

1449
01:46:12,889 --> 01:46:19,614
TRAVIS: Some more? Okay. We can see if they need
anyone for hire, go and have a... (tearing up

1450
01:46:19,614 --> 01:46:21,785
again) being strong.

1451
01:46:21,785 --> 01:46:30,257
LIAM: I would feel it very hard to leave Pike
behind in the city. Are we really going to leave

1452
01:46:30,257 --> 01:46:31,422
and go to Kraghammer?

1453
01:46:31,422 --> 01:46:34,873
MARISHA: Well, we don't have to. I don't want to
go yet. We traveled several days here. While we're

1454
01:46:34,873 --> 01:46:41,285
in this side of the country, I should probably go,
you know. Do the things I was set out to do.

1455
01:46:41,285 --> 01:46:43,076
TRAVIS: Plus we have the poo cell phone.

1456
01:46:43,076 --> 01:46:45,525
LAURA: Good job, Scanlan.

1457
01:46:45,525 --> 01:46:47,675
SAM: It's more of a poo walkie-talkie.

1458
01:46:47,675 --> 01:46:50,520
LIAM: I don't know what either of those things
are.

1459
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,195
SAM: Just know that there's poo involved.

1460
01:46:53,195 --> 01:46:56,341
LIAM: Does the poop talk like my earring? Because
that I understand.

1461
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:57,840
LAURA: Yes, it's like a poop earring.

1462
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,706
LIAM: It's like a poop earring. Why didn't you say
that in the first place? You talk through it? You

1463
01:47:01,706 --> 01:47:04,254
talk to poo?

1464
01:47:04,254 --> 01:47:05,533
SAM: You see through it.

1465
01:47:05,533 --> 01:47:07,161
MATT: Hashtag poop earring.

1466
01:47:07,161 --> 01:47:12,662
LAURA: So yes. There's multiple things.

1467
01:47:12,662 --> 01:47:17,795
SAM: Well, multiple things. There's just go back
to Kraghammer and get money, or go where Keyleth

1468
01:47:17,795 --> 01:47:18,874
wants to go.

1469
01:47:18,874 --> 01:47:22,965
LAURA: We can look for work here, we can go back
to Bahamut, see if they want--

1470
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:24,915
TALIESIN: Keyleth's got family. We can visit her
family.

1471
01:47:24,915 --> 01:47:28,465
LAURA: That's what I'm talking about, yes. Fire,
brimstone, volcanoes. Druids.

1472
01:47:28,465 --> 01:47:30,605
TRAVIS: Keyleth, do you have an opinion?

1473
01:47:30,605 --> 01:47:36,439
MARISHA: I mean... I guess if you guys don't have
anything else to do, yeah.

1474
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:38,039
LIAM: How far are they from here?

1475
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:47,734
MARISHA: I'm not sure. We'd have to start asking
around. They're remote. We're secluded people.

1476
01:47:47,734 --> 01:47:48,758
LAURA: Secrety.

1477
01:47:48,758 --> 01:47:53,932
MARISHA: We're a little secrety, yeah, and we
haven't heard-- I just want to clarify, you know.

1478
01:47:53,932 --> 01:48:01,322
I haven't talked to them in a long time, so I hope
they're nice. And I'm sure they're--

1479
01:48:01,322 --> 01:48:04,365
LIAM: Family stuff can be tricky.

1480
01:48:04,365 --> 01:48:08,329
TALIESIN: It seems a shame to have a family and
not take advantage of it.

1481
01:48:08,329 --> 01:48:12,379
SAM: What's family for other to take advantage
of?

1482
01:48:12,379 --> 01:48:14,535
TRAVIS: To hit. To kiss.

1483
01:48:14,535 --> 01:48:17,238
LAURA: To kiss? You kiss your family?

1484
01:48:17,238 --> 01:48:19,242
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a goliath. What about it?

1485
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:22,980
LAURA: There are things about goliaths I did not
want to know.

1486
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:27,411
That water has a good effect on him.

1487
01:48:27,411 --> 01:48:32,761
LIAM: Do you feel drawn to your parents, though?
Do you want to go?

1488
01:48:32,761 --> 01:48:36,675
MARISHA: I have to go. I don't have a choice.

1489
01:48:36,675 --> 01:48:38,058
LIAM: Then we should go.

1490
01:48:38,058 --> 01:48:41,105
MARISHA: Okay. I just don't want to inconvenience
anybody.

1491
01:48:41,105 --> 01:48:43,949
LAURA: Inconvenience, schminconvenience.

1492
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:45,438
SAM: Oh, is that Dwarvish?

1493
01:48:45,438 --> 01:48:47,681
LAURA: Yes. It's actually Underdark. I'm fluent.

1494
01:48:47,681 --> 01:48:52,051
MARISHA: Oh wait, that was Dwarvish?
Inconschmenience.

1495
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:53,567
TALIESIN: Your accent's amazing.

1496
01:48:53,567 --> 01:48:59,185
MARISHA: I'm trying to work on learning more
Dwarvish. Okay.

1497
01:48:59,185 --> 01:49:06,074
TRAVIS: I have a question for you, Vax. The
Braving Grounds that are here, would it be to our

1498
01:49:06,074 --> 01:49:13,319
benefit to collect maybe some coin and practice
our (gets choked up) fighting before we go to the

1499
01:49:13,319 --> 01:49:15,954
maybe-friendly fire jugglers' village?

1500
01:49:15,954 --> 01:49:19,033
LIAM: You want to go back in there? It's awfully
fresh.

1501
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:24,358
TRAVIS: Not the Crucible. Don't rub my face in it.
Not in the Crucible, to the Braving Grounds.

1502
01:49:24,358 --> 01:49:32,056
LIAM: The Braving Grounds. We were just in the
pub. I mean, that was just a backyard brawl,

1503
01:49:32,056 --> 01:49:34,708
basically. He's talking about going to the
temple.

1504
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,970
TRAVIS: Was that the Crucible I was in?

1505
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:43,603
MATT: The Crucible was the pit you were in. The
temple you were at is the Trial Forge. The whole

1506
01:49:43,603 --> 01:49:47,283
area you guys are in, this district of Vasselheim,
is known as the Braving Grounds.

1507
01:49:47,283 --> 01:49:52,017
LIAM: This is what I think, Grog. It's too fresh.
You need some time away from it. We should

1508
01:49:52,017 --> 01:49:56,054
absolutely come back and you should break that
guy's fucking face, no question.

1509
01:49:56,054 --> 01:49:58,059
TRAVIS: (choked up) I could've. Totally could've.

1510
01:49:58,059 --> 01:49:59,801
LIAM: You almost did.

1511
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:04,231
LAURA: Yeah. Next time, bite his nose off right
away before it's concave.

1512
01:50:04,231 --> 01:50:07,938
TRAVIS: I saved it for too late. I did it too
late. But then in the balls...

1513
01:50:07,938 --> 01:50:10,407
LAURA: The balls-- good effort.

1514
01:50:10,407 --> 01:50:15,361
LIAM: We've come a very long way. Keyleth is near
her family.

1515
01:50:15,361 --> 01:50:19,028
She needs to see where that road lies.

1516
01:50:19,028 --> 01:50:21,151
TALIESIN: We should take care of each other.

1517
01:50:21,151 --> 01:50:25,122
LIAM: And once we do, we'll come back and fucking
kill that guy.

1518
01:50:25,122 --> 01:50:26,975
TRAVIS: And we can use weapons if they suck,
right?

1519
01:50:26,975 --> 01:50:28,016
LIAM: Yes.

1520
01:50:28,016 --> 01:50:33,824
LAURA: Speaking of weapons, aren't we in a perfect
weapons-buying district?

1521
01:50:33,824 --> 01:50:35,023
SAM: Is that true?

1522
01:50:35,023 --> 01:50:42,031
TRAVIS: Yes! Can we go find an armory or somewhere
that sells pointy things?

1523
01:50:42,031 --> 01:50:49,716
MATT: You can certainly try. Yeah. As a note, too,
as you're having this conversation, you reach into

1524
01:50:49,716 --> 01:50:53,860
your pocket, Grog. As you're feeling around in
your pocket, you realize that you saved in your

1525
01:50:53,860 --> 01:51:00,276
drunken state the upper lip. It's rubbery and dry,
but it's there.

1526
01:51:00,276 --> 01:51:05,928
TRAVIS: I tuck that inside of my belt-beard. Just
so it's nice there.

1527
01:51:05,928 --> 01:51:08,286
One little part of it just flapping out.

1528
01:51:08,286 --> 01:51:11,146
LAURA: What about your beard? Is he growing his
beard?

1529
01:51:11,146 --> 01:51:12,179
TRAVIS: Oh, it is a new day.

1530
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:16,607
MATT: You get to go ahead and roll a percentage
dice.

1531
01:51:16,607 --> 01:51:20,213
TRAVIS: Nine, 90.

1532
01:51:20,213 --> 01:51:26,452
MATT: 99. No beard this morning. It goes the other
way.

1533
01:51:26,452 --> 01:51:28,180
TRAVIS: It goes the other way?!

1534
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,459
MATT: Lower percentage.

1535
01:51:29,459 --> 01:51:33,563
TRAVIS: My life is shit! I can't do anything!

1536
01:51:33,563 --> 01:51:35,532
MATT: It's a rough day for Grog.

1537
01:51:35,532 --> 01:51:38,752
TRAVIS: I'm hanging myself. Where's the bridge?

1538
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,120
SAM: There's no bridge here.

1539
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:46,536
LAURA: Actually, I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm incredibly low on funds at the moment.

1540
01:51:46,536 --> 01:51:49,328
TALIESIN: Perhaps shopping is not the best path.

1541
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:52,442
MARISHA: We did just do a lot of shopping.

1542
01:51:52,442 --> 01:51:55,244
SAM: Yeah, let's go adventuring.

1543
01:51:55,244 --> 01:52:00,128
TALIESIN: We haven't had an awkward parental
confrontation in what feels like months.

1544
01:52:00,128 --> 01:52:02,725
MARISHA: Okay. You guys, I'm so nervous.

1545
01:52:02,725 --> 01:52:05,457
TRAVIS: You really are?

1546
01:52:05,457 --> 01:52:08,822
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's a big thing.

1547
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:10,953
TRAVIS: Have you seen them, ever?

1548
01:52:10,953 --> 01:52:16,288
MARISHA: The first time I left home was when I met
up with you guys.

1549
01:52:16,288 --> 01:52:22,683
MATT: (impact) You guys suddenly hear this
slamming sound that echoes throughout the nearby

1550
01:52:22,683 --> 01:52:29,335
city. You hear this impact, like this distant
crashing of stone against stone. A few seconds

1551
01:52:29,335 --> 01:52:35,522
later, you hear this low (horn sound), this horn
that's just bellowing out, this deep echoing horn.

1552
01:52:35,522 --> 01:52:41,106
The rest of the tavern looks around, confused. A
couple of individuals step outside to look.

1553
01:52:41,106 --> 01:52:42,999
ORION: I'm at the dock, right?

1554
01:52:42,999 --> 01:52:48,526
MATT: You've been walking away for a while, and
you get about roughly ten minutes away before you

1555
01:52:48,526 --> 01:52:51,918
hear this impact and these horns going off in the
distance.

1556
01:52:51,918 --> 01:52:56,206
SAM: I turn to the barkeep and say, well, what was
that? Do you know? Have you heard that before?

1557
01:52:56,206 --> 01:52:57,322
What is that?

1558
01:52:57,322 --> 01:53:00,387
MATT: "It's the horn of the Trial. Means there's
some sort of attack."

1559
01:53:00,387 --> 01:53:03,877
SAM: Attack? Where? How do we know where?

1560
01:53:03,877 --> 01:53:07,065
MATT: "I don't know, but I'm getting ready." And
he starts going to the back room.

1561
01:53:07,065 --> 01:53:09,215
LAURA: Getting ready where? What are we doing?

1562
01:53:09,215 --> 01:53:14,210
ORION: I'm going to cast Fly on myself and see
what's going on.

1563
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:17,526
MATT: Okay, so you become visible and begin
lifting up into the air--

1564
01:53:17,526 --> 01:53:19,651
ORION: No, I'm still invisible for a round.

1565
01:53:19,651 --> 01:53:25,108
MATT: Oh, because the-- okay. So you lift into the
air and then appear as the concentration spell

1566
01:53:25,108 --> 01:53:31,133
wears off. You got your crown. Looking over, you
can see immediately there appears to be some

1567
01:53:31,133 --> 01:53:35,613
commotion, like some dust has scattered up from
the forest on the far side of the Braving Grounds,

1568
01:53:35,613 --> 01:53:37,314
outside of the major wall of the city.

1569
01:53:37,314 --> 01:53:42,911
ORION: I'm going to do a (whoosh) to where they
are.

1570
01:53:42,911 --> 01:53:46,506
MATT: Okay, you start gliding over. As you guys
rush out, you can see now a bunch of the Bastions

1571
01:53:46,506 --> 01:53:50,843
that are set across the top of the wall are
gathering and loading in bolts, and you see two of

1572
01:53:50,843 --> 01:53:58,716
them fire. You hear this now guttural roaring
sound, but multiple ones, like a chorus of large

1573
01:53:58,716 --> 01:54:05,178
bestial screams echo and then (wham) a second
slamming sound of stone into stone, and you can

1574
01:54:05,178 --> 01:54:11,328
see at the very distant wall, right below where
those two Bastions would have fired those giant

1575
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:17,601
dragon-headed bolt-throwers, both get thrown off
the top, falling a good 40 feet out of view beyond

1576
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:23,347
the distant rooftops. You can see a small crack
beginning to form at the top of the wall. Two

1577
01:54:23,347 --> 01:54:27,180
other Bastions now begin to rush in and take the
place of those two bolt-throwers.

1578
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:30,264
LIAM: I yank two daggers out, flip them, catch
them, and just start running.

1579
01:54:30,264 --> 01:54:34,484
LAURA: Can I grab the flying carpet out of the Bag
of Holding before you take off?

1580
01:54:34,484 --> 01:54:35,461
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1581
01:54:35,461 --> 01:54:39,450
MATT: Sure. You grab it. You guys start running.
You're gliding in.

1582
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:41,825
SAM: I'm ambling behind them.

1583
01:54:41,825 --> 01:54:44,818
ORION: I'm going to where the attack is, not to
them.

1584
01:54:44,818 --> 01:54:46,702
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop on the carpet with
you.

1585
01:54:46,702 --> 01:54:47,934
MARISHA: I'm going.

1586
01:54:47,934 --> 01:54:49,900
LAURA: I swing down and pick up my brother.

1587
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,595
TALIESIN: I'm hopping on, as well.

1588
01:54:51,595 --> 01:54:52,924
MATT: You hop on.

1589
01:54:52,924 --> 01:54:54,803
LIAM: Come along, Percival.

1590
01:54:54,803 --> 01:55:00,469
MATT: At which point, two more bolts are let
loose, and you hear the creature once again scream

1591
01:55:00,469 --> 01:55:03,876
(screech) in pain, and then the footfalls.

1592
01:55:03,876 --> 01:55:06,225
LIAM: We don't see them yet?

1593
01:55:06,225 --> 01:55:12,247
MATT: No, you just hear it. It's on the other side
of the wall. You see what looks like a toothy maw

1594
01:55:12,247 --> 01:55:17,015
streak across the top of the tower for a moment,
and then the tree line shift, and the footfalls

1595
01:55:17,015 --> 01:55:18,734
get quieter and quieter.

1596
01:55:18,734 --> 01:55:23,062
TRAVIS: Go ask one of the Bastion guys what it
was.

1597
01:55:23,062 --> 01:55:27,252
LAURA: Yeah, we fly up next to one of the shooter
guys and say, what was it? What is it?

1598
01:55:27,252 --> 01:55:30,716
MATT: Okay, you glide up to it, and as you look
down, you can see the two Bastions that fell.

1599
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:34,355
They're currently being tended to. One of them
looks unconscious and rough from the impact of the

1600
01:55:34,355 --> 01:55:39,315
fall, the other one's walking with a limp, trying
to find its way back towards the interior of the

1601
01:55:39,315 --> 01:55:43,724
wall that leads up to the top of his post. The one
you come by has sweat beading down his face and

1602
01:55:43,724 --> 01:55:47,357
you see he's loaded another bolt and he's looking
out, wide-eyed, towards the forest. He goes,

1603
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:48,988
"It came back."

1604
01:55:48,988 --> 01:55:51,150
LAURA: What came back?

1605
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:57,718
MATT: "We've had this blasted thing seen on and
off again for the past few weeks. Maybe it's

1606
01:55:57,718 --> 01:56:02,956
"hungry or it's bored, but either way, this
multi-headed thing, this hydra-like creature keeps

1607
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:06,144
"coming in and I don't know, I think it's testing
the wall."

1608
01:56:06,144 --> 01:56:08,125
LAURA: Like a raptor.

1609
01:56:08,125 --> 01:56:09,469
TRAVIS: They remember.

1610
01:56:09,469 --> 01:56:11,646
LAURA and LIAM: Clever girl.

1611
01:56:11,646 --> 01:56:14,313
(laughter)

1612
01:56:14,313 --> 01:56:16,130
SAM: Should we go kill it?

1613
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:20,590
LIAM: I don't see it anymore. I think it's gone
back into the woods.

1614
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:27,412
MATT: "It's fled. Got a few hits in, but it went
and... we can never seem to get enough to take it down."

1615
01:56:27,412 --> 01:56:29,969
LIAM: How frequently are these attacks coming?

1616
01:56:29,969 --> 01:56:31,705
SAM: Of course we can track it.

1617
01:56:31,705 --> 01:56:37,982
MATT: "I mean, you're welcome to try. It's only
been maybe two or three times this past week, but

1618
01:56:37,982 --> 01:56:43,859
"it's come once or twice a week for the past month,
hitting different areas of the city. Not just this

1619
01:56:43,859 --> 01:56:49,854
"beast, a few different ones, but mostly this
abomination. It's a nuisance more than anything,

1620
01:56:49,854 --> 01:56:53,317
"although it did get a good hit on the wall." And
he looks over and you can see there's a crack in

1621
01:56:53,317 --> 01:57:01,113
the stone. He looks nervously over it and, "I'll
get to fixing that right quick. It keeps slinking

1622
01:57:01,113 --> 01:57:05,338
"off back into the Vesper Timberlands. Kord help us
if there's more than one of these."

1623
01:57:05,338 --> 01:57:11,548
LAURA: Kord help us. Good old Kord. Okay.

1624
01:57:11,548 --> 01:57:14,960
TRAVIS: I grab my earring and I say, Tiberius,
where are you?

1625
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,537
ORION: I'm flying around.

1626
01:57:16,537 --> 01:57:21,070
MATT: You just now glide over, seeing the flying
carpet towards the top of the wall.

1627
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:22,826
ORION: I'm above you.

1628
01:57:22,826 --> 01:57:24,221
TRAVIS: Where?

1629
01:57:24,221 --> 01:57:25,660
ORION: Here!

1630
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:31,109
MATT: He is visible, just gliding by. You guys
have run up to the edge of the wall. You're

1631
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:36,314
beneath looking up at the flying carpet and
they're having this conversation at such a

1632
01:57:36,314 --> 01:57:42,127
distance where you can't really hear them talking.
Percy, Vex, and Vax, you're up on the flying

1633
01:57:42,127 --> 01:57:43,677
carpet currently, conversing with the Bastion.

1634
01:57:43,677 --> 01:57:47,024
LAURA: Can we float up a little bit and see if we
can see movement in the trees where it is?

1635
01:57:47,024 --> 01:57:51,642
MATT: You glance over and you can see the canopy
shifting slightly. It's about a quarter-mile off

1636
01:57:51,642 --> 01:57:56,589
and disappearing before it's eventually a little
bit out of sight. You figure a creature that large

1637
01:57:56,589 --> 01:57:58,430
can't be too difficult to track.

1638
01:57:58,430 --> 01:57:59,473
LAURA: Okay.

1639
01:57:59,473 --> 01:58:01,309
SAM: Go kill it?

1640
01:58:01,309 --> 01:58:05,408
LAURA: Well, here's the thing. I bring the carpet
back down and say, I see where it went, if you

1641
01:58:05,408 --> 01:58:11,091
guys want to fight it. What do you think?

1642
01:58:11,091 --> 01:58:13,914
ORION: I'd like to go get my money at Kraghammer.

1643
01:58:13,914 --> 01:58:18,188
SAM: I thought we'd decided to go to Keyleth's.

1644
01:58:18,188 --> 01:58:20,714
MATT: The individuals are now, they're
currently--

1645
01:58:20,714 --> 01:58:25,055
MARISHA: You left during the family meeting.

1646
01:58:25,055 --> 01:58:28,254
LIAM: That money's not going anywhere.

1647
01:58:28,254 --> 01:58:30,438
ORION: I suppose you're right.

1648
01:58:30,438 --> 01:58:33,445
LIAM: Let's help the city out, then we'll go on to
see Keyleth's parents.

1649
01:58:33,445 --> 01:58:37,617
SAM: Help the city out by going to track the hydra
first?

1650
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:45,387
TRAVIS: I run back to the tavern real fast. People
have left, right?

1651
01:58:45,387 --> 01:58:48,338
MATT: Yeah, there are people outside looking at
what happened.

1652
01:58:48,338 --> 01:58:49,475
TRAVIS: Barkeep still there?

1653
01:58:49,475 --> 01:58:51,943
MATT: He's there, and he's currently putting on
armor by himself.

1654
01:58:51,943 --> 01:58:58,197
TRAVIS: It's okay, it left. Big crack in the wall.
Might think about leaving. Before you do, the

1655
01:58:58,197 --> 01:59:02,881
Siren. Where might I find her?

1656
01:59:02,881 --> 01:59:11,488
MATT: He thinks to himself, says, "She's a
slippery one. She only shows up when she wants to

1657
01:59:11,488 --> 01:59:18,552
"start a fight. I gather your best bet would be to
ask around. I hear she runs at times with the--

1658
01:59:18,552 --> 01:59:27,057
"what are they called? The Slayer's Take. The
Slayer's Take." As you guys are talking about

1659
01:59:27,057 --> 01:59:32,509
this, the Bastion that was talking to you guys is
now coming down the wall, and he's like, "Are you

1660
01:59:32,509 --> 01:59:34,752
"seriously thinking about going after that thing?"

1661
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:36,877
SAM: Only if there's money involved.

1662
01:59:36,877 --> 01:59:39,851
MATT: "Oh, I can guarantee a beast of that size
and that much of a problem's got a hell of a price

1663
01:59:39,851 --> 01:59:41,119
"on its head."

1664
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:42,442
LAURA and SAM: From who?

1665
01:59:42,442 --> 01:59:45,497
(laughter)

1666
01:59:45,497 --> 01:59:51,084
MATT: "I gather anyone you take it to at that
point. Probably take just one or more of its heads

1667
01:59:51,084 --> 01:59:55,097
"back, or some proof it's dead, and I'm sure there
will be a few people that will fight hand over

1668
01:59:55,097 --> 01:59:56,428
"fist to pay for that."

1669
01:59:56,428 --> 01:59:59,667
LIAM: We could easily get a head. Let's go right
now. Grog's doing something. Let's go.

1670
01:59:59,667 --> 02:00:04,172
SAM: Hey, Grog. Grog, come in. We're going to go
kill something. We need you.

1671
02:00:04,172 --> 02:00:08,060
LIAM: How? We're on the carpet, he's flying.
Scanlan's riding on an eagle.

1672
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:10,887
MARISHA: I can try a Locate Creature spell.

1673
02:00:10,887 --> 02:00:13,157
TALIESIN: You can do a what?

1674
02:00:13,157 --> 02:00:15,100
MARISHA: I can cast Locate Creature.

1675
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:16,564
TALIESIN: She can cast Locate Creature.

1676
02:00:16,564 --> 02:00:25,324
SAM: Let's leave Trinket behind. Just for now,
it's so hard to keep track of Trinket, Jesus.

1677
02:00:25,476 --> 02:00:27,901
LIAM: Grog's been fighting for a long time, he
needs rest. Let's go!

1678
02:00:27,901 --> 02:00:30,021
MATT: Trinket is there behind you.

1679
02:00:30,021 --> 02:00:34,033
LAURA: Polymorph him, please.

1680
02:00:34,033 --> 02:00:37,123
MARISHA: I didn't learn Polymorph. You're going to
have to ask Scanlan about that one.

1681
02:00:37,123 --> 02:00:39,225
LAURA: Scanlan, please. Polymorph him.

1682
02:00:39,225 --> 02:00:41,102
SAM: What, me? Do I know Polymorph?

1683
02:00:41,102 --> 02:00:43,197
LIAM: Whatever that thing is, it's getting away.
We're losing time.

1684
02:00:43,197 --> 02:00:45,510
LAURA: We can track him. I'm a ranger.

1685
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:48,676
MARISHA: I drop to my knees and I cast Locate
Creature.

1686
02:00:48,676 --> 02:00:50,903
TRAVIS: I can only come if Tiberius lets me.

1687
02:00:50,903 --> 02:00:55,085
SAM: Oh, to fly.

1688
02:00:55,085 --> 02:01:00,980
LIAM: Yes, exactly. Let's keep twiddling our
thumbs.

1689
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:06,026
ORION: I'm going to cast Fly out of my ring on
Grog.

1690
02:01:06,026 --> 02:01:07,662
MATT: All right. Grog.

1691
02:01:07,662 --> 02:01:10,352
SAM: I guess we're going. Hold on!

1692
02:01:10,352 --> 02:01:12,826
MARISHA: Do you want to use your ranger tracking
skills, or should I try and cast the spell?

1693
02:01:12,826 --> 02:01:15,001
LAURA: I can definitely use my ranger skills.

1694
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:19,628
ORION: I'm going to cast it at 5th level, and I'm
going to cast it on myself, I'll keep it on him,

1695
02:01:19,628 --> 02:01:21,377
Grog, and Trinket.

1696
02:01:21,377 --> 02:01:25,081
MATT: Okay. So Trinket once again-- (distressed
bear noises)

1697
02:01:25,081 --> 02:01:27,225
ORION: Like last time, remember, Trinket?

1698
02:01:27,225 --> 02:01:30,823
MATT: Trinket seems to be a little less perturbed
by the circumstance.

1699
02:01:30,823 --> 02:01:35,041
TRAVIS: I grab Trinket's paw like in Superman 1,
and we fly.

1700
02:01:35,041 --> 02:01:38,300
MATT: Grog and Trinket, coasting through the air,
arm in paw.

1701
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:39,906
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tiberius.

1702
02:01:39,906 --> 02:01:42,584
LIAM: Peter Pan and Wendy.

1703
02:01:42,584 --> 02:01:44,635
TALIESIN: Can you read my mind?

1704
02:01:44,635 --> 02:01:52,245
MATT: All right. So as you guys all drift up over
the town, you can immediately see the Bastion that

1705
02:01:52,413 --> 02:01:57,766
was talking to you is looking very, very curiously
at Tiberius.

1706
02:01:57,766 --> 02:02:00,080
LAURA: Oh, don't worry, he's really nice!

1707
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:03,658
SAM: Sorry, there was just a little magic so we
could go kill the hydra, sorry...

1708
02:02:03,658 --> 02:02:07,227
(laughter)

1709
02:02:07,227 --> 02:02:11,179
MATT: As you guys vanish over the wall, you can
now see before you

1710
02:02:11,179 --> 02:02:13,422
the entirety of the Vesper Timberlands.

1711
02:02:13,422 --> 02:02:17,919
LIAM: Most people just say thank you! Dick.

1712
02:02:17,919 --> 02:02:24,822
MATT: Below you, the landscape is entirely
consumed by what looks like the densest forest

1713
02:02:24,822 --> 02:02:32,808
you've ever encountered. The cold air seems to be
growing colder as the day progresses on and the

1714
02:02:32,808 --> 02:02:39,908
clouds themselves are choked dark grey. The rain
never fell last night, but the storms seem, or at

1715
02:02:39,908 --> 02:02:44,723
least the storm front that seems to push its 
way is still ominously looking overhead the

1716
02:02:44,723 --> 02:02:49,246
entirety of this landscape. Looking down across
the Vesper Timberland, you can see the thick

1717
02:02:49,246 --> 02:02:54,385
canopy, the occasional mountain or hill that's
jutting through the top of it, but there is no

1718
02:02:54,385 --> 02:02:58,862
movement. There is no current sign of the
creature.

1719
02:02:58,862 --> 02:03:01,373
TRAVIS: Let's use some bait.

1720
02:03:01,373 --> 02:03:05,068
SAM: Wait no, we saw the direction it went in,
right?

1721
02:03:05,068 --> 02:03:06,236
LAURA: Yeah.

1722
02:03:06,236 --> 02:03:10,216
LIAM: Don't worry, my sister's a ranger. She can
track anything.

1723
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:12,692
LAURA: Why are you being an asshole to me today?

1724
02:03:12,692 --> 02:03:14,452
LIAM: I don't know, why am I?

1725
02:03:14,452 --> 02:03:15,909
LAURA: I don't know!

1726
02:03:15,909 --> 02:03:18,184
(laughter)

1727
02:03:18,184 --> 02:03:21,026
LAURA: I judged him, apparently, but I don't
remember doing it.

1728
02:03:21,026 --> 02:03:23,229
LIAM: The Critters will figure it out.

1729
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:28,356
LAURA: Yeah, can I go low to the ground and track
it?

1730
02:03:28,356 --> 02:03:34,430
MATT: You can. So you take the carpet down, and as
it hits the canopy, it's a very slow, arduous

1731
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:41,651
process to weave between the thick network of
branches and vines and other bits of growth that

1732
02:03:41,651 --> 02:03:46,866
have completely covered the top of this forest.
Eventually, the carpet comes down into the floor.

1733
02:03:46,866 --> 02:03:49,161
The rest of you guys who are flying coming along,
as well?

1734
02:03:49,161 --> 02:03:50,459
SAM: I'm coming along.

1735
02:03:50,459 --> 02:03:53,514
MATT: You all come down behind the carpet,
eventually breaking through the top of the canopy

1736
02:03:53,514 --> 02:03:55,976
and reaching the interior of the Vesper Timberland
itself.

1737
02:03:55,976 --> 02:03:58,271
LAURA: This is my other favored terrain.

1738
02:03:58,271 --> 02:04:09,686
MATT: Good to know. This forest, incredibly lush,
presses up against the city walls itself, nearly

1739
02:04:09,686 --> 02:04:13,857
oppressively with the impact. It grows up right
against the city wall. And it's almost like the

1740
02:04:13,857 --> 02:04:19,849
wall itself is constantly keeping it at bay in the
way that the growth that's pushing inward. The

1741
02:04:19,849 --> 02:04:23,627
tree trunks you see, now that you've hit the
interior, vary in size, some only a few feet in

1742
02:04:23,627 --> 02:04:31,335
diameter. You come across a couple that are 20, 30
feet or more, giant trees. Also, even though it's

1743
02:04:31,335 --> 02:04:36,837
midday at this point in time, the light into the
forest is choked so thin it's almost like it's

1744
02:04:36,837 --> 02:04:45,275
dusk, near dark, inside the forest. The air hits
you with the smell of wet earth, moss. Vines and

1745
02:04:45,275 --> 02:04:49,499
branches dangle from and reach from every
direction, and you can see there are, you can walk

1746
02:04:49,499 --> 02:04:53,919
through the path here, but nearing trees
themselves, the roots are so large and so twisted

1747
02:04:53,919 --> 02:04:57,685
where they enter the ground. You're definitely
going to have to keep up

1748
02:04:57,685 --> 02:04:59,239
with your ranger friend here.

1749
02:04:59,239 --> 02:05:00,795
LIAM: Just like the old days.

1750
02:05:00,795 --> 02:05:02,505
ORION: Now we've touched down and we're
traveling?

1751
02:05:02,505 --> 02:05:07,350
MATT: You guys are in the forest pushing through
various walkways. Go ahead and make a survival

1752
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:08,820
check with advantage.

1753
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:10,898
SAM: Survival check? Is that for her?

1754
02:05:10,898 --> 02:05:12,960
MATT: Yep. She's tracking the creature.

1755
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,335
LAURA: Oh, natural 20!

1756
02:05:14,335 --> 02:05:16,065
(cheering)

1757
02:05:16,065 --> 02:05:26,132
MATT: All right. Following its path, you see that
there are tracks going both ways, meaning the

1758
02:05:26,132 --> 02:05:31,425
creature as it came through towards the city, it
turned its path about and then exited the same

1759
02:05:31,425 --> 02:05:36,764
pathway. So as you're following it along for a
good 15 minutes or so, you come across a small

1760
02:05:36,764 --> 02:05:39,783
opening in the forest where you can see what looks
to be a very messily

1761
02:05:39,783 --> 02:05:42,866
partially devoured carcass of something.

1762
02:05:42,866 --> 02:05:44,048
LAURA: Is it big?

1763
02:05:44,048 --> 02:05:47,630
MATT: It looks like it was pretty big, it's
definitely spread out over this area.

1764
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:50,848
LAURA: I think it ate something here, you guys.

1765
02:05:50,848 --> 02:05:51,697
SAM: Good ranging.

1766
02:05:51,697 --> 02:05:52,912
LAURA: Thank you.

1767
02:05:52,912 --> 02:05:55,588
TALIESIN: I'd like to try and identify the animal
that it ate.

1768
02:05:55,588 --> 02:05:58,855
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1769
02:05:58,855 --> 02:06:00,186
TALIESIN: 13?

1770
02:06:00,186 --> 02:06:09,237
MATT: 13? You look at it, it appears to be some
sort of furred beast. Huge in size at one point,

1771
02:06:09,237 --> 02:06:11,779
it is long-dead for at least--

1772
02:06:11,779 --> 02:06:13,369
TALIESIN: Like moose-big or bigger?

1773
02:06:13,369 --> 02:06:22,575
MATT: No, as big as some of the umber hulks you've
fought. But it looks humanoid-ish, more

1774
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:27,124
primate-like. The more you look at it, it looks
like it may have been at one point a large,

1775
02:06:27,124 --> 02:06:35,330
massive ape of some kind. But it has been torn
open, limbs scattered all across this small

1776
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:41,785
clearing. You can see there are a series of bite
and scratch marks across it, and most of its

1777
02:06:41,785 --> 02:06:43,311
internal organs are missing.

1778
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:45,845
TALIESIN: I don't know what we're tracking, but I
think it's friendly.

1779
02:06:45,845 --> 02:06:49,425
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if I can
figure anything

1780
02:06:49,425 --> 02:06:51,823
out about the nature of the attack?

1781
02:06:51,823 --> 02:06:53,314
MATT: Sure.

1782
02:06:53,314 --> 02:06:59,138
MARISHA: That's going to be 21.

1783
02:06:59,138 --> 02:07:06,248
MATT: 21. As you look down at it and you take
close inspection on the attack, you look, a

1784
02:07:06,248 --> 02:07:10,827
creature like this, when it destroys and bites,
especially the creature that you saw earlier

1785
02:07:10,827 --> 02:07:17,205
briefly, it appeared through the canopy when you
first arrived. Many heads, gnashing teeth. The

1786
02:07:17,205 --> 02:07:22,196
bite marks and the attack on this carcass are
definitely in line with that creature. However,

1787
02:07:22,196 --> 02:07:26,722
you do notice that there are other marks and
attacks across it, as well. Some of the wounds

1788
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:34,462
across its body appear to be made by weapons.
There are gash marks and slashes. And the more and

1789
02:07:34,462 --> 02:07:40,637
more you inspect the body, you can see the blood
that has been scattered about by this was thick

1790
02:07:40,637 --> 02:07:46,105
and congealed by the time that it was tossed
amongst this opening.

1791
02:07:46,105 --> 02:07:52,787
MARISHA: Does it look like the wounds from the
weapons happened post-mortem?

1792
02:07:52,787 --> 02:07:54,256
Or at the same time?

1793
02:07:54,256 --> 02:07:59,360
MATT: Actually, the wounds from the weapons appear
to have occurred fresh, whereas the wounds from

1794
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:02,063
being killed and eaten, or being eaten by the
creature,

1795
02:08:02,063 --> 02:08:05,534
appear to be post-mortem by quite some time.

1796
02:08:05,534 --> 02:08:08,810
LIAM: So it was killed by civilized folks and then
torn apart by this thing.

1797
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:14,388
TRAVIS: Maybe the Slayer's Take.

1798
02:08:14,388 --> 02:08:20,195
MARISHA: Can I figure out what kind, was it some
bird creature? Is all Percy could--

1799
02:08:20,195 --> 02:08:27,696
MATT: Ape creature. It's essentially a massive,
for lack of a better term, a dire-sized ape.

1800
02:08:27,696 --> 02:08:38,720
TALIESIN: Dire-ape. It's possible somebody was
feeding it.

1801
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:47,110
LAURA: Should we continue on, keep tracking?

1802
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:53,027
LIAM: My sister and I are going to check and see
if there's any sign of it in the area.

1803
02:08:53,027 --> 02:08:58,020
LAURA: Yeah, perception check around. Oh, that
looks good.

1804
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:02,650
LIAM: Yes, it was. 21 for me.

1805
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:12,198
LAURA: Yeah, only 18 for me. But wait, advantage.
That's way better! 25.

1806
02:09:12,198 --> 02:09:19,501
MATT: 25. Looking ahead, this carcass was eaten
before the creature attacked the city. You can see

1807
02:09:19,501 --> 02:09:26,400
from the time difference that this happened. But
it has torn through this space recently. You can

1808
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:32,837
see part of the body has been shoved aside and
crushed under some giant clawed foot. It continues

1809
02:09:32,837 --> 02:09:40,143
weaving between the trees in this small pathway
that looks well-worn, like there are some portions

1810
02:09:40,143 --> 02:09:45,733
of the forest that are well-overgrown and mostly
untouched. There is a specific path along the

1811
02:09:45,733 --> 02:09:52,086
floor of this forest that looks like it's been
used often by large footsteps and small ones.

1812
02:09:52,086 --> 02:09:56,414
LAURA: Should we follow along that path? But maybe
off to the side a bit, like in the trees but next

1813
02:09:56,414 --> 02:09:57,529
to the path?

1814
02:09:57,529 --> 02:10:01,014
SAM: No, let's just go down the middle. What, did
it leave traps? It's a hydra.

1815
02:10:01,014 --> 02:10:03,983
LIAM: I'll go down in the bushes, thanks.

1816
02:10:03,983 --> 02:10:10,793
ORION: Is it like a thicket? Is this rough terrain
we're going through?

1817
02:10:10,793 --> 02:10:14,542
MATT: There are many portions of this that come
across as rough terrain. At certain times it's

1818
02:10:14,542 --> 02:10:18,998
okay, especially on the worn path, any off that
can be a little more difficult to traverse.

1819
02:10:18,998 --> 02:10:20,753
ORION: Is it plant life?

1820
02:10:20,753 --> 02:10:27,361
MATT: Plant life, tree roots, heavy thick branches
that have fallen or have grown out and interwoven.

1821
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:32,749
Occasional rocks or natural formations that are
jutting out of the earth.

1822
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:37,389
SAM: Let's continue on as fast as possible.

1823
02:10:37,389 --> 02:10:39,844
MATT: Make another tracking check, with
advantage.

1824
02:10:39,844 --> 02:10:41,515
LAURA: Oh man, another one?

1825
02:10:41,515 --> 02:10:45,575
MATT: (singing) Advantage.

1826
02:10:45,575 --> 02:10:48,021
LAURA: 16.

1827
02:10:48,021 --> 02:10:54,593
SAM: I'm going to inspire her with a little song
of inspiration. (singing) And the ranger's going

1828
02:10:54,593 --> 02:10:59,130
to range, range, range, range, range. And the
tracker's going to track, track, track, track,

1829
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:03,714
track. I'm just going to watch, watch, watch,
watch, watch. Watch her range.

1830
02:11:03,714 --> 02:11:06,276
ALL: (singing) Watch her range.

1831
02:11:06,276 --> 02:11:10,865
LAURA: What do I need to add?

1832
02:11:10,865 --> 02:11:12,141
MATT: A d10.

1833
02:11:12,141 --> 02:11:18,092
LAURA: Okay, so 19.

1834
02:11:18,092 --> 02:11:20,128
SAM: Oh good. Three points.

1835
02:11:20,128 --> 02:11:27,881
MATT: All right. You continue moving forward off
the track for another ten minutes or so before you

1836
02:11:27,881 --> 02:11:29,819
see some movement ahead.

1837
02:11:29,819 --> 02:11:32,728
LAURA: Perception?

1838
02:11:32,728 --> 02:11:34,220
MATT: Perception check.

1839
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:40,373
TALIESIN: I'll join in that. 21.

1840
02:11:40,373 --> 02:11:42,610
TRAVIS: 12.

1841
02:11:42,610 --> 02:11:43,946
LAURA: 18.

1842
02:11:43,946 --> 02:11:46,493
ORION: How far away are we from each other?

1843
02:11:46,493 --> 02:11:48,731
MATT: You guys are keeping a pretty close view,
you're a little behind them, but you're letting

1844
02:11:48,731 --> 02:11:51,858
them push forward unless you choose to do anything
otherwise.

1845
02:11:51,858 --> 02:11:53,829
LIAM: I'm going stealth.

1846
02:11:53,829 --> 02:11:58,836
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check. You and
Percy go ahead and you look forward, and you

1847
02:11:58,836 --> 02:12:02,259
notice there are a couple small pools of water
that have just coalesced through the recent storms

1848
02:12:02,259 --> 02:12:09,528
or just a natural small pool of water that exists
in this portion, but you can see the back of a

1849
02:12:09,528 --> 02:12:20,017
large, scaled creature with a tan dark-brown hide,
long tail, currently stooped down and drinking

1850
02:12:20,017 --> 02:12:26,167
from the waters in the pool. You can hear the
distant (lapping) sound of water dripping out of

1851
02:12:26,167 --> 02:12:31,627
its jaws, and you can see now, there are multiple
heads taking drinks out of this pool here.

1852
02:12:31,748 --> 02:12:38,131
SAM: Is the foliage around us green? Brown?
Standard foliage color?

1853
02:12:38,131 --> 02:12:41,484
MATT: In this area, because of the nature of the
rich earth,

1854
02:12:41,484 --> 02:12:43,418
most of the foliage here is a deep green.

1855
02:12:43,418 --> 02:12:49,284
SAM: I'm going to turn us all deep green. With
Seeming.

1856
02:12:49,284 --> 02:12:51,473
LIAM: With what now?

1857
02:12:51,473 --> 02:13:08,179
SAM: Seeming. Yes with Seeming. I spread my
Seeming all over us, turning us green. With

1858
02:13:08,179 --> 02:13:09,915
Seeming all over us.

1859
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:14,229
TALIESIN: There's nothing you can't ruin.

1860
02:13:14,229 --> 02:13:26,663
MATT: As the hue of your garments begin to shift
to the color of the surrounding forest, I'd like

1861
02:13:26,663 --> 02:13:31,750
everybody to make a stealth check who hasn't
already, with advantage.

1862
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:33,209
LIAM: Oh, 30.

1863
02:13:33,209 --> 02:13:34,902
ORION: I cast Stoneskin right now.

1864
02:13:34,902 --> 02:13:39,820
SAM: We're rolling for stealth? With advantage?

1865
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:41,761
LAURA: Natural 20!

1866
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:46,736
TALIESIN: 15.

1867
02:13:46,736 --> 02:13:48,656
SAM: 16.

1868
02:13:48,656 --> 02:13:52,058
MARISHA: 25 total.

1869
02:13:52,058 --> 02:14:00,149
MATT: These are trees. There, looming at the edge
of the water--

1870
02:14:00,149 --> 02:14:02,993
LAURA: Whoa. Is that a dragon?

1871
02:14:02,993 --> 02:14:05,388
MATT: That is a massive hydra.

1872
02:14:05,388 --> 02:14:08,128
LAURA: So it's not technically in the dragon
school?

1873
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:14,374
MATT: No. It is considered a monstrosity,
technically. You guys are all hidden

1874
02:14:14,374 --> 02:14:15,969
off to the side here.

1875
02:14:15,969 --> 02:14:17,778
LIAM: I'm scooting forward quietly.

1876
02:14:17,778 --> 02:14:19,928
TALIESIN: Hail, hydra.

1877
02:14:19,928 --> 02:14:22,728
MARISHA: Where do you hail from, hydra?

1878
02:14:22,728 --> 02:14:31,565
MATT: All right, we'll put that as your guys'
current placement. Stealth scores are?

1879
02:14:31,565 --> 02:14:32,648
LIAM: 30.

1880
02:14:32,648 --> 02:14:33,595
SAM: 16.

1881
02:14:33,595 --> 02:14:34,972
ORION: 18.

1882
02:14:34,972 --> 02:14:36,275
MARISHA: 25.

1883
02:14:36,275 --> 02:14:37,466
TALIESIN: 15.

1884
02:14:37,466 --> 02:14:38,608
TRAVIS: 15.

1885
02:14:38,608 --> 02:14:40,093
LAURA: It was a natural 20. Do I add anything?

1886
02:14:40,093 --> 02:14:41,450
MATT: No, you don't have to worry about that.

1887
02:14:41,450 --> 02:14:42,965
SAM: So we're all good.

1888
02:14:42,965 --> 02:14:48,943
MATT: Okay. The creature keeps drinking.
Occasionally, a head will come up and look around.

1889
02:14:48,943 --> 02:14:52,875
Another head will come up and snap at it, and snap
back, and then both go down and they start

1890
02:14:52,875 --> 02:14:56,243
drinking on their own. You apparently are not
currently noticed.

1891
02:14:56,243 --> 02:14:58,359
LAURA: Should I have rolled for Trinket?

1892
02:14:58,359 --> 02:15:00,611
MATT: Go ahead and roll for Trinket.

1893
02:15:00,611 --> 02:15:01,830
LAURA: I rolled an 18 for Trinket.

1894
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:07,599
MATT: Okay, Trinket's fine. Trinket with his deep
green fur, at the moment.

1895
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:12,689
So what would you like to do?

1896
02:15:12,689 --> 02:15:15,216
LIAM: I'm pulling out my Dagger of Venom.

1897
02:15:15,216 --> 02:15:18,462
TRAVIS: Set a really good trap. Let's think about
this.

1898
02:15:18,462 --> 02:15:25,210
MARISHA: I can box him in with my Wall of Stone.

1899
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:29,646
LAURA: I can cast the spike-growth thing again.

1900
02:15:29,646 --> 02:15:32,584
SAM: Should we try to push him in the water?

1901
02:15:32,584 --> 02:15:34,139
TRAVIS: We could lightning the water.

1902
02:15:34,139 --> 02:15:37,695
LAURA: In the water, then lightning the water?
That's good.

1903
02:15:37,695 --> 02:15:40,313
ORION: I have all kinds of things.

1904
02:15:40,313 --> 02:15:41,827
TRAVIS: Suggestions?

1905
02:15:41,936 --> 02:15:47,461
LIAM: If you box it in, we can't get inside.

1906
02:15:47,461 --> 02:15:51,671
ORION: If we can nudge it into where he's
drinking, then box him in.

1907
02:15:51,671 --> 02:15:53,778
LAURA: Drown him?

1908
02:15:53,778 --> 02:15:55,323
TRAVIS: Or lightning the water?

1909
02:15:55,323 --> 02:15:58,473
LAURA: Yeah. Box him in the water and then
lightning the water.

1910
02:15:58,473 --> 02:15:59,948
TRAVIS: Keyleth, you're up.

1911
02:15:59,948 --> 02:16:06,519
LIAM: Keyleth, when you shape the stone, can you
make it lean towards him in a ramp? I can run up.

1912
02:16:06,519 --> 02:16:11,743
It would still box him in. I could just traverse
it.

1913
02:16:11,743 --> 02:16:26,329
MARISHA: Yeah, I see what you're saying. I'm going
to pyramid him in, essentially. I'm going to try

1914
02:16:26,329 --> 02:16:35,959
and make almost behind him is an auditorium and
the front of him is a jabby ramp.

1915
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:38,468
Does that make sense? Auditorium?

1916
02:16:38,468 --> 02:16:40,041
SAM: Let's do this.

1917
02:16:40,041 --> 02:16:46,746
MATT: Okay. The wall of stone has to be connected
to itself, so it would have to be like--

1918
02:16:46,746 --> 02:16:54,361
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do a spiral. Like a spiraly
ramp that traps him in.

1919
02:16:54,361 --> 02:17:00,499
TALIESIN: We're going to take the carpet and make
our way to the other pond.

1920
02:17:00,499 --> 02:17:05,447
LAURA: Do you want to go from either side? You
take the carpet, go to the other side, and I'll

1921
02:17:05,447 --> 02:17:09,897
walk over with Trinket to the other. What is he
looking for?

1922
02:17:09,897 --> 02:17:15,781
MATT: Our carpet got moved. We have flying carpets
from fans here I want to use, but it got moved.

1923
02:17:16,023 --> 02:17:18,724
MARISHA: Are they in our magic box?

1924
02:17:18,724 --> 02:17:27,281
MATT: We'll find them. We've got carpets from you
guys to use. We'll get that in just a second. It's

1925
02:17:27,281 --> 02:17:33,733
fine. We've got to move. So Percy?

1926
02:17:33,733 --> 02:17:37,344
TALIESIN: I have the carpet, I'm going to head
towards that small--

1927
02:17:37,344 --> 02:17:41,827
MATT: You have the laser pointer. Show me.

1928
02:17:41,827 --> 02:17:44,074
TALIESIN: What is that?

1929
02:17:44,074 --> 02:17:45,671
MATT: That is a rock.

1930
02:17:45,671 --> 02:17:48,764
TALIESIN: I'm going to move just to the other side
of that.

1931
02:17:48,764 --> 02:17:52,370
MATT: Okay, you coast through here, unseen.

1932
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:57,179
LAURA: I'm going to do the same to the other side,
actually.

1933
02:17:57,179 --> 02:18:00,164
MATT: Around and behind to this side, here?

1934
02:18:00,164 --> 02:18:06,277
LAURA: Would I be able to shoot him from behind
the one further back?

1935
02:18:06,277 --> 02:18:11,251
MATT: From here, right now? No.

1936
02:18:11,251 --> 02:18:15,579
LAURA: Well then I'll go behind the big tree.
There, yeah. Totally hidden!

1937
02:18:15,579 --> 02:18:18,253
MATT: Yes. Anyone else, placement?

1938
02:18:18,253 --> 02:18:19,882
SAM: I'm going to move closer.

1939
02:18:19,882 --> 02:18:22,379
MATT: Okay. Right there.

1940
02:18:22,379 --> 02:18:31,022
MARISHA: Hey, Matt? Instead of Wall of Stone, I'm
actually going to cast my one 6th-level spell,

1941
02:18:31,022 --> 02:18:33,322
which is Move Earth.

1942
02:18:33,322 --> 02:18:37,427
MATT: Have you read Move Earth?

1943
02:18:37,427 --> 02:18:40,943
MARISHA: Yeah. A few weeks ago.

1944
02:18:40,943 --> 02:18:46,717
MATT: You can move large chunks of earth over a
small period of time. It's not an attack spell,

1945
02:18:46,717 --> 02:18:50,111
it's more of you can dig a cave.

1946
02:18:50,111 --> 02:18:55,268
MARISHA: Never mind. I'll stick with the original
plan. I can't dome him up and go ahead and push

1947
02:18:55,268 --> 02:18:56,782
him in the water really quick at this point?

1948
02:18:56,782 --> 02:18:58,075
MATT: Probably not with that one.

1949
02:18:58,075 --> 02:19:04,701
MARISHA: All right, I'll stick with Wall of Stone,
which I know I can do. Make a hydra pyramid!

1950
02:19:04,701 --> 02:19:13,617
LIAM: I rolled a 30. I want to get down in a
crouch and just run right there.

1951
02:19:13,617 --> 02:19:20,168
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, where are you going? To have
line of sight on the creature,

1952
02:19:20,168 --> 02:19:21,468
where are you going?

1953
02:19:21,468 --> 02:19:23,036
MARISHA: Right there is fine.

1954
02:19:23,036 --> 02:19:24,932
MATT: You don't have line of sight on the
creature. There's a tree blocking.

1955
02:19:24,932 --> 02:19:28,212
MARISHA: Oh. No, let me move towards Scanlan.

1956
02:19:28,212 --> 02:19:29,525
MATT: All right, so over here?

1957
02:19:29,525 --> 02:19:30,648
MARISHA: Yep.

1958
02:19:30,648 --> 02:19:36,450
ORION: I'd like to do an investigation on his-- oh
yes! I rolled a 21.

1959
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:37,813
MATT: What are you trying to do?

1960
02:19:37,813 --> 02:19:39,780
ORION: Guess how much he weighs.

1961
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:53,440
MATT: A creature of this size, probably close to
two tons. More than three tons, maybe?

1962
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:57,282
5,000 pounds.

1963
02:19:57,282 --> 02:20:02,827
ORION: Damn it. Too big.

1964
02:20:02,827 --> 02:20:08,642
MATT: It's a big creature. Grog, where are you
going?

1965
02:20:08,642 --> 02:20:13,857
TRAVIS: I'm going to post up on, where's my laser
pointer?

1966
02:20:13,857 --> 02:20:22,155
SAM: In your eye! God, you're having the worst day!

1967
02:20:22,155 --> 02:20:24,526
LIAM: Just headbutt a tree or something.

1968
02:20:24,526 --> 02:20:26,299
MATT: Tiberius, you're staying right there?

1969
02:20:26,299 --> 02:20:30,409
ORION: Keeping within 100 feet of it.

1970
02:20:30,409 --> 02:20:33,470
MATT: Okay, that's well within a hundred feet.

1971
02:20:33,470 --> 02:20:41,575
ORION: Well, Vax can move. Is that my best POV?

1972
02:20:41,575 --> 02:20:43,677
MATT: To see it, yeah. Otherwise, you would be
blocked.

1973
02:20:43,677 --> 02:20:44,975
ORION: Okay.

1974
02:20:44,975 --> 02:20:45,914
MATT: All right.

1975
02:20:45,914 --> 02:20:50,166
ORION: Actually, we can move anywhere right now,
right?

1976
02:20:50,166 --> 02:20:55,656
MATT: All right, is everyone set? Who's taking
first initiative on this?

1977
02:20:55,656 --> 02:20:57,090
MARISHA: I am.

1978
02:20:57,090 --> 02:20:59,456
LAURA: Can you move Trinket next to Grog?

1979
02:20:59,456 --> 02:21:02,201
MATT: Trinket moves around next to Grog.

1980
02:21:02,201 --> 02:21:06,671
MARISHA: Okay, I want to try and do a little
pushy-shovery at the same time.

1981
02:21:06,671 --> 02:21:10,410
MATT: All right. There you are.

1982
02:21:10,410 --> 02:21:12,916
LAURA: There we go, look at us all. Strategized.

1983
02:21:12,916 --> 02:21:16,881
SAM: Yeah, that's going to come in handy when he
just kills all of us in one shot.

1984
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:25,658
MARISHA: Okay. As he gets in that corner of that
puddle, I'm going to Fibonacci circle and starting

1985
02:21:25,658 --> 02:21:28,739
here, push him in a bit and wrap him up.

1986
02:21:28,739 --> 02:21:37,832
MATT: Okay, so you create from the earth a wall of
stone that comes jutting out. That way?

1987
02:21:37,832 --> 02:21:44,287
MARISHA: Yeah, I want him to be tight in the
circle here, and if I can get it to push him

1988
02:21:44,287 --> 02:21:45,853
towards the water.

1989
02:21:45,853 --> 02:21:51,338
MATT: The force of the wall of stone slams into
him and through the physical form, it's not enough

1990
02:21:51,338 --> 02:21:55,905
to actually move a creature of its size and
weight, but it does form around it and hold it in

1991
02:21:55,905 --> 02:21:57,320
place, currently.

1992
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:02,286
LIAM: As soon as Vax sees that, he starts running
through the grass, up the slope of the stone.

1993
02:22:02,286 --> 02:22:15,194
MATT: It's currently surrounded by a ramp of
stone. The heads start reaching out and biting at

1994
02:22:15,194 --> 02:22:16,296
the stone.

1995
02:22:16,296 --> 02:22:17,559
ORION: You're running up the stone?

1996
02:22:17,559 --> 02:22:21,575
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm clicking one boot against the
other as I run up it, so I'm going faster, run up,

1997
02:22:21,575 --> 02:22:25,442
and I'm going to jump and I'm going to start
stabbing into that head.

1998
02:22:25,442 --> 02:22:28,007
MATT: All righty. Go for it.

1999
02:22:28,007 --> 02:22:38,773
LIAM: Okay, 17. Shit. And 27.

2000
02:22:38,773 --> 02:22:40,019
MATT: Second one hits.

2001
02:22:40,019 --> 02:22:41,617
LIAM: The final one hits?

2002
02:22:41,617 --> 02:22:43,403
MATT: Oh sorry, the first one was?

2003
02:22:43,403 --> 02:22:45,454
LIAM: 17. One.

2004
02:22:45,454 --> 02:22:47,108
MATT: One misses, the final one hits, yes.

2005
02:22:47,108 --> 02:23:00,503
LIAM: Okay. So does this count as sneak attack?
All right, so I roll a nine for damage, plus

2006
02:23:00,503 --> 02:23:08,329
eight, 12, 14, 15, 17 of sneak attack damage, with
the first attack, that's poison.

2007
02:23:08,329 --> 02:23:12,357
And the poison is DC 15.

2008
02:23:12,357 --> 02:23:19,549
MATT: DC 15. Misses. Does not make its save.

2009
02:23:19,549 --> 02:23:26,426
LIAM: With 11 points of poison damage to its head.
That's just the first attack that hits. And then I

2010
02:23:26,426 --> 02:23:33,580
take my keen dagger and I jab for the eye, and
that is a ten of damage.

2011
02:23:33,580 --> 02:23:37,587
MATT: Nice. It is considered a sneak attack
because this is a surprise round.

2012
02:23:37,587 --> 02:23:39,201
LIAM: Both attacks?

2013
02:23:39,201 --> 02:23:41,383
MATT: The first attack that hits is considered a
sneak attack.

2014
02:23:41,383 --> 02:23:43,244
LIAM: First attack I gave you was sneak attack.

2015
02:23:43,244 --> 02:23:45,858
MATT: No, I mean the first attack that hits it.
You missed, missed, and then you hit.

2016
02:23:45,858 --> 02:23:47,503
LIAM: Oh, I thought I hit and missed and hit.

2017
02:23:47,503 --> 02:23:50,607
MATT: Missed, missed, and hit.

2018
02:23:50,607 --> 02:23:54,099
LIAM: All right, well then erase the first numbers
I told you. It's just ten plus--

2019
02:23:54,099 --> 02:23:57,674
it was 17, so 27.

2020
02:23:57,674 --> 02:24:02,958
MATT: All right. 27 damage. You leap, run up the
stonework, click the heels, rush down and then

2021
02:24:02,958 --> 02:24:10,466
slam, and the dagger slips into the front of its
torso, the actual blade pulsing as the magical

2022
02:24:10,466 --> 02:24:17,101
energy expels itself, the poison rocketing through
its body. All of a sudden, the heads turn around

2023
02:24:17,101 --> 02:24:19,593
and now you have five heads looking at you.

2024
02:24:19,593 --> 02:24:23,859
LIAM: Add 15 of poison to that. Add 15 of poison.

2025
02:24:23,859 --> 02:24:29,369
MATT: Awesome. Is he poisoned? Or just takes 15
additional points of damage?

2026
02:24:29,369 --> 02:24:33,565
LIAM: It gets poisoned, and it takes damage on the
first hit and every round

2027
02:24:33,565 --> 02:24:35,163
I think it takes that poison.

2028
02:24:35,163 --> 02:24:37,662
MATT: No, it just means it's poisoned, which means
it has disadvantage.

2029
02:24:37,662 --> 02:24:40,349
LIAM: Oh, yes. DC 15, plus damage on the hit.

2030
02:24:40,349 --> 02:24:42,907
MATT: There's the flying carpet.

2031
02:24:42,907 --> 02:24:45,245
(cheering)

2032
02:24:45,245 --> 02:24:50,258
ORION: Is any part of the creature still in the
water?

2033
02:24:50,258 --> 02:24:53,418
MATT: One of its feet is currently off to the side
in the water.

2034
02:24:53,418 --> 02:24:59,398
ORION: Cool. I'm going to cast Invisibility. And I
can see it, because I'm on the other side of the

2035
02:24:59,398 --> 02:25:02,804
ramp, right? I'm going to cast Chain Lightning
right at the foot.

2036
02:25:02,804 --> 02:25:12,170
SAM: Chain Lightning? You have Chain Lightning?

2037
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:13,989
MARISHA: It's new.

2038
02:25:13,989 --> 02:25:16,892
ORION: Yes, it is. It's a 150 foot range, and I do
10d8 damage.

2039
02:25:16,892 --> 02:25:21,799
SAM: I know, I used it at the fight that you
didn't want to fight in.

2040
02:25:21,799 --> 02:25:24,642
MATT: Yeah, what's the DC?

2041
02:25:24,642 --> 02:25:27,213
ORION: 17.

2042
02:25:27,213 --> 02:25:30,070
MATT: 17. All right, it does make its save, so
half damage.

2043
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:41,686
ORION: How do I count these? There's a bunch of
sevens. Stupid ones.

2044
02:25:41,686 --> 02:25:50,777
SAM: 28.

2045
02:25:50,777 --> 02:25:52,850
ORION: All together?

2046
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:54,267
SAM: No, that's 28.

2047
02:25:54,267 --> 02:25:59,402
ORION: Oh. 38. 43.

2048
02:25:59,402 --> 02:26:06,463
MATT: 43. Awesome. So a total of 22 points of
damage from a save. So as it's stepping into the

2049
02:26:06,463 --> 02:26:15,512
water, it takes an additional, I'll say,
additional 2d8 from being in the water. I'll roll

2050
02:26:15,512 --> 02:26:21,924
them here. Additional nine damage to that. As it
pulls back, the stone around it, the rogue leaps

2051
02:26:21,924 --> 02:26:25,811
up and slams it with a blade, its heads turn
around, and as it does, you turn around, vanish

2052
02:26:25,811 --> 02:26:28,929
from sight, and then... you cast Greater
Invisibility or just Invisibility?

2053
02:26:28,929 --> 02:26:30,377
ORION: Greater.

2054
02:26:30,377 --> 02:26:35,492
MATT: Okay. Release your hands and a torrent of
blue electrical energy rockets forth from your

2055
02:26:35,492 --> 02:26:40,556
hands, streaking out, some parts leaving arcs that
hit the nearby forests and then slamming into its

2056
02:26:40,556 --> 02:26:44,381
body, its exposed heads. You can see the arcs now
shooting through between the various necks and

2057
02:26:44,381 --> 02:26:49,043
bodies. It writhes and streaks about, slamming its
body into part of the stone that cracks and heaves

2058
02:26:49,043 --> 02:26:55,665
from the impact, still holding it in place. Well
done. You want to move, or is that your turn?

2059
02:26:55,665 --> 02:26:59,023
ORION: I'm going, what are the big lumps, are
those trees?

2060
02:26:59,023 --> 02:27:04,929
MATT: These are trees. Anywhere walking on the
trunk around it is difficult terrain,

2061
02:27:04,929 --> 02:27:06,367
you cannot pass.

2062
02:27:06,367 --> 02:27:08,904
ORION: I'm just going to go right behind that
tree.

2063
02:27:08,904 --> 02:27:12,560
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Who else
wants to do anything this round?

2064
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,200
LAURA: I want to shoot him.

2065
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:18,475
MATT: You all get a free round, and then we roll
initiative.

2066
02:27:18,475 --> 02:27:20,383
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on
it.

2067
02:27:20,383 --> 02:27:23,181
MATT: Hunter's Mark on it.

2068
02:27:23,181 --> 02:27:29,078
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, DM? This is after the fact.
Assassinate, on any attack before the enemy's had

2069
02:27:29,078 --> 02:27:32,631
a chance to take a turn yet, any hit on surprise
is a crit.

2070
02:27:32,631 --> 02:27:37,082
MATT: Good to know, so that's 54 damage from your
initial strike.

2071
02:27:37,082 --> 02:27:40,338
LIAM: Thank you. That's all I get. That's all I
do.

2072
02:27:40,338 --> 02:27:58,675
LAURA: So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at 3rd
level. I'm going to roll for that. Jesus. That's

2073
02:27:58,675 --> 02:28:04,779
only 16. That doesn't hit, does it?

2074
02:28:04,779 --> 02:28:10,067
MATT: For Hail of Thorns? 16 does not hit,
unfortunately.

2075
02:28:10,067 --> 02:28:12,229
MARISHA: Even though he's trapped?

2076
02:28:12,229 --> 02:28:17,502
MATT: No, it's against the armor. It actually
ricochets off the hide of the creature and

2077
02:28:17,502 --> 02:28:23,288
disappears. It explodes against a tree trunk in
the distance, and you can see a smattering of

2078
02:28:23,288 --> 02:28:25,888
magical thorns shoot out into one of the
canopies.

2079
02:28:25,888 --> 02:28:29,997
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to try just doing a
regular attack through the magical bow of fire.

2080
02:28:29,997 --> 02:28:32,938
And that is 17.

2081
02:28:32,938 --> 02:28:36,852
MATT: Hail of Thorns is an action to cast, though,
isn't it? You've already used your bonus action to

2082
02:28:36,852 --> 02:28:38,302
cast Hunter's Mark.

2083
02:28:38,302 --> 02:28:41,330
LAURA: Then never mind, I don't do anything. I
just fucking fucked that up.

2084
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:43,567
MATT: It's okay, it's a surprise round. Do you
want to do anything with

2085
02:28:43,567 --> 02:28:45,078
your self-placement or Trinket-wise?

2086
02:28:45,078 --> 02:28:47,026
LAURA: Yeah, I want to climb a tree that I'm next
to.

2087
02:28:47,026 --> 02:28:51,239
MATT: Okay. Using your movement. Go ahead and
make, we'll say an

2088
02:28:51,239 --> 02:28:56,377
athletics check to climb the tree.

2089
02:28:56,377 --> 02:28:59,412
LAURA: What was that, athletics or acrobatics?

2090
02:28:59,412 --> 02:29:00,788
MATT: Athletics.

2091
02:29:00,788 --> 02:29:02,047
LAURA: Why?

2092
02:29:02,047 --> 02:29:04,847
MATT: Because there's no branches nearby, you have
to--

2093
02:29:04,847 --> 02:29:07,650
LAURA: Six! I'm going to stay on the ground.

2094
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:13,315
MATT: You slide back to the trunk, turn around and
grab your bow and prepare yourself.

2095
02:29:13,315 --> 02:29:14,604
Trinket, anything?

2096
02:29:14,604 --> 02:29:22,375
LAURA: Trinket's going to stay right there.

2097
02:29:22,375 --> 02:29:28,951
SAM: I'll move and do Lightning. Why not? Just try
to get as much as possible. Just so I won't hit

2098
02:29:28,951 --> 02:29:30,484
whoever that is.

2099
02:29:30,484 --> 02:29:33,125
MATT: That would probably be right there. All
right, so you unleash a Lightning Bolt?

2100
02:29:33,125 --> 02:29:34,491
SAM: Yes, I do.

2101
02:29:34,491 --> 02:29:39,836
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage, 8d6. Does not make
its save. Rolled a five.

2102
02:29:39,836 --> 02:29:43,719
LIAM: By the way, we need seven more subs, which
is ironically the same

2103
02:29:43,719 --> 02:29:45,746
number of heads the hydra has.

2104
02:29:45,746 --> 02:29:48,357
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and ORION: Seven more subs?

2105
02:29:48,357 --> 02:29:50,136
MATT: Seven more subs?

2106
02:29:50,136 --> 02:29:52,465
TALIESIN: We're going to get a bear!

2107
02:29:52,465 --> 02:29:54,448
SAM: 19.

2108
02:29:54,448 --> 02:29:55,542
MATT: 19?

2109
02:29:55,542 --> 02:29:56,585
SAM: 19.

2110
02:29:56,585 --> 02:29:58,903
MATT: All right, gotcha. That was the total 8d6?

2111
02:29:58,903 --> 02:30:00,838
SAM: That was 6d6.

2112
02:30:00,838 --> 02:30:05,840
MATT: 8d6 for Lightning Bolt. Roll two more.

2113
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,237
SAM: Ten more!

2114
02:30:07,237 --> 02:30:11,567
MATT: All right, 29. You turn around the corner,
the energy still crackling around it from the

2115
02:30:11,567 --> 02:30:15,594
Chain Lightning. You unleash your own Lightning
Bolt that hits it from the side, slamming into the

2116
02:30:15,594 --> 02:30:19,842
side of one of the heads. The head actually pops
from the impact. It's now got four heads.

2117
02:30:19,842 --> 02:30:23,513
SAM: Oh, hey. I got a head!

2118
02:30:23,513 --> 02:30:38,463
TALIESIN: What's my distance? Is this Pepperbox
distance or Bad News distance, at the moment?

2119
02:30:38,463 --> 02:30:42,279
MATT: Right now, you can't see because there's a
tree in the way, but you're Pepperbox distance

2120
02:30:42,279 --> 02:30:45,531
from here. You could try Bad News, but you'd have
to set up in place.

2121
02:30:45,531 --> 02:30:51,463
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to start curling
around the tree I'm near. I'm going to take some

2122
02:30:51,463 --> 02:30:59,785
movement to fly over the pond back here. And while
I'm making my little round, I'm going to take two

2123
02:30:59,805 --> 02:31:01,388
shots with the Pepperbox.

2124
02:31:01,388 --> 02:31:06,395
MATT: Okay, so as the carpet's gliding past,
you're basically strafing it and (gunshots). Go

2125
02:31:06,395 --> 02:31:07,658
ahead and fire.

2126
02:31:07,658 --> 02:31:09,321
LIAM: You have a bear.

2127
02:31:09,321 --> 02:31:12,197
MARISHA: She has a bear? We got a bear!

2128
02:31:12,197 --> 02:31:15,357
MATT: Oh my god, there's going to be a giant
Trinket. That's so stupid.

2129
02:31:15,357 --> 02:31:26,035
TALIESIN: Full-on misfire. (cackles) Yeah, I
misfire. I don't care; we got a bear.

2130
02:31:26,035 --> 02:31:30,445
MATT: All right. We got a bear. As you strafe past, you
pull your Pepperbox and go to fire. Suddenly

2131
02:31:30,445 --> 02:31:36,381
there's a dull sound, and as you look at your gun,
it explodes for a second in your face. You barely

2132
02:31:36,381 --> 02:31:40,450
manage to get your visage out of the way as the
barrel itself is heated up and you have to shake

2133
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:44,063
it off. Yeah, your Pepperbox is looking a bit
rough right now.

2134
02:31:44,063 --> 02:31:45,331
TALIESIN: It's fine; I'm putting it away.

2135
02:31:45,331 --> 02:31:49,772
MATT: Okay. So everyone else has gone but Grog.

2136
02:31:49,772 --> 02:31:55,075
TRAVIS: Me? Can I run all the way up and try and
pull a Vax, like he did?

2137
02:31:55,075 --> 02:31:56,820
MATT: Yeah.

2138
02:31:56,820 --> 02:32:00,137
TRAVIS: Hey, I want to try that! And I rage as I
attack it!

2139
02:32:00,137 --> 02:32:04,835
MATT: All right, as you rush up, axe in your hand,
you rush up the side of the stone ramp that she's

2140
02:32:04,835 --> 02:32:07,553
created and it's right in slamming distance. Go
ahead.

2141
02:32:07,553 --> 02:32:13,970
TRAVIS: I swing away. 24.

2142
02:32:13,970 --> 02:32:16,259
MATT: 24 hits.

2143
02:32:16,259 --> 02:32:20,027
TRAVIS: Yes, and the second. 16.

2144
02:32:20,027 --> 02:32:23,105
MATT: 16, no. 16 misses. And then?

2145
02:32:23,105 --> 02:32:29,698
TRAVIS: That's it, just the two. I'm not frenzied.
Yes. 17.

2146
02:32:29,698 --> 02:32:33,596
MATT: 17 points of damage as you hack once again,
slamming into the side of one of the necks,

2147
02:32:33,596 --> 02:32:39,798
causing a gout of purplish blood to spray over the
right side of your body. That ends the combat

2148
02:32:39,798 --> 02:32:44,206
round for the surprise round. The creature is now
aware that you're definitely there. Everyone roll

2149
02:32:44,206 --> 02:32:53,102
initiative. All right, so 25 to 20?

2150
02:32:53,102 --> 02:32:54,469
ORION: 22.

2151
02:32:54,469 --> 02:33:00,703
MATT: 20 to 15?

2152
02:33:00,703 --> 02:33:02,408
LAURA: 19.

2153
02:33:02,408 --> 02:33:06,080
SAM: 16. First good roll I've ever had.

2154
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:09,090
MATT: For initiative, yeah. 15 to ten?

2155
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:10,803
TALIESIN: 13.

2156
02:33:10,803 --> 02:33:12,088
TRAVIS: 13.

2157
02:33:12,088 --> 02:33:14,501
MATT: Both of you guys 13. All right.

2158
02:33:14,501 --> 02:33:19,419
MARISHA: Four.

2159
02:33:19,419 --> 02:33:20,847
LIAM: 12.

2160
02:33:20,847 --> 02:33:22,625
ORION: That's what you usually get.

2161
02:33:22,625 --> 02:33:23,949
TALIESIN: You got a four?

2162
02:33:23,949 --> 02:33:26,062
MARISHA: Yeah, I did.

2163
02:33:26,062 --> 02:33:31,930
MATT: All right. Top of the round, Tiberius. As
you start to see the head that got blown off, two

2164
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:33,979
heads sprout out of the--

2165
02:33:33,979 --> 02:33:36,690
SAM: Out of the wound.

2166
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:40,055
MATT: It now has six heads.

2167
02:33:40,055 --> 02:33:42,008
SAM: It had five when we started!

2168
02:33:42,008 --> 02:33:44,981
MATT: Yep. And when you blew off the head, two
more grew in its place.

2169
02:33:44,981 --> 02:33:51,078
LAURA: Wait, but when Hercules defeated him, he
just cut off so many that they started attacking

2170
02:33:51,078 --> 02:33:53,202
themselves and they got tangled up.

2171
02:33:53,202 --> 02:33:55,673
MATT: Regardless, Tiberius, it's your turn.

2172
02:33:55,673 --> 02:34:02,158
ORION: It's still on the same position it was,
though, right? When we started? Right?

2173
02:34:02,158 --> 02:34:10,801
MATT: Yep. It did seem to heal a bit of its wounds
as the heads pull out of it.

2174
02:34:10,801 --> 02:34:12,809
It has a sense of regeneration.

2175
02:34:12,809 --> 02:34:19,742
ORION: And I go, oh no you don't. And I stick out
my ring and Chain Lightning him again.

2176
02:34:19,742 --> 02:34:23,329
MATT: Chain Lightning is a 6th-level spell.

2177
02:34:23,329 --> 02:34:27,274
ORION: Yeah, I know, and I had one stored in my
ring.

2178
02:34:27,274 --> 02:34:31,958
MATT: Your ring can only store up to a 3rd-level
spell. We went over this last time. It's okay.

2179
02:34:31,958 --> 02:34:39,670
ORION: No, I thought that was the Ioun Stone. We
all learned something today, kids. I don't do

2180
02:34:39,670 --> 02:34:59,222
that. Instead, fine. I'm going to cast Telekinesis
once. And I'm instantly going to do quicken spell

2181
02:34:59,222 --> 02:35:06,491
and do five sorcerer points to cast it immediately
again. Cast it on one head and another head and

2182
02:35:06,491 --> 02:35:14,432
(bashing, tying sounds). To try and wrap them all
and choke them.

2183
02:35:14,432 --> 02:35:23,448
MATT: Go ahead and roll an arcana check for the
first one.

2184
02:35:23,448 --> 02:35:29,137
ORION: Wasn't terrible. What is that?

2185
02:35:29,137 --> 02:35:30,220
SAM: 14.

2186
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:33,797
MATT: Okay, and for the second one?

2187
02:35:33,797 --> 02:35:35,725
ORION: Natural 20.

2188
02:35:35,725 --> 02:35:42,903
MATT: Okay, so it rolled a 17 on its second save.
The first one, it did not resist because it rolled

2189
02:35:42,903 --> 02:35:47,616
a three. So what you do as you cast Telekinesis
once, you use the sorcery points to cast it again.

2190
02:35:47,616 --> 02:35:52,502
You can't get all the heads, but you can grab two
of them, one focus for each telekinetic thing. You

2191
02:35:52,502 --> 02:35:57,344
take both heads and (whack, whack) slam them three
times into each other and then twist the necks

2192
02:35:57,344 --> 02:36:00,978
around at the point where both of them are biting
onto their own necks after they've torn into a

2193
02:36:00,978 --> 02:36:11,369
second. For that, they're both going to take 2d8
impact damage. That's nine plus five. 14 points of

2194
02:36:11,369 --> 02:36:18,613
impact damage to each head. Both of those heads are
currently grappling each other, so they will not

2195
02:36:18,613 --> 02:36:20,484
be able to attack on its turn.

2196
02:36:20,484 --> 02:36:29,853
ORION: And then I go back against the tree. That
is my turn.

2197
02:36:29,853 --> 02:36:34,743
MATT: All right. It is now the hydra's turn. It
rolled a really high initiative. The two heads are

2198
02:36:34,743 --> 02:36:40,585
going to untangle themselves. That's their attack.
Now it only has four strikes this turn, two of

2199
02:36:40,585 --> 02:36:46,106
which are going to be against you and two of which
are going to be against you. All right, so. Two of

2200
02:36:46,106 --> 02:36:55,139
the heads rear back, lunging at Vax over here.
That's going to be a 29.

2201
02:36:55,139 --> 02:36:58,287
Second one is going to be a 19.

2202
02:36:58,287 --> 02:36:59,835
LIAM: Yes.

2203
02:36:59,835 --> 02:37:16,410
MATT: All right. So you take... 17 and 15. 17 and
15, so 32 points of piercing damage. One of the

2204
02:37:16,410 --> 02:37:22,325
heads snaps down on your torso and lifts you up
for a second as the other grabs the side of your

2205
02:37:22,325 --> 02:37:26,195
body, and it feels like it's about to tear you
apart for a second until you manage to elbow it in

2206
02:37:26,195 --> 02:37:32,485
the nose and manage to get free of one head and
shake off the other. Grog, another head comes at

2207
02:37:32,485 --> 02:37:34,987
you. First one comes at a 24.

2208
02:37:34,987 --> 02:37:36,218
TRAVIS: Hits.

2209
02:37:36,218 --> 02:37:37,613
MATT: And a natural 20 for the second.

2210
02:37:37,613 --> 02:37:41,979
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess so. Phillip's a fucking
douche today.

2211
02:37:41,979 --> 02:37:50,949
MATT: 14 points from the first one. You are
raging, so it's halved to seven. The other one

2212
02:37:50,949 --> 02:38:01,807
that is a critical, that does come to 24, so 12
points of piercing damage. All right. That ends

2213
02:38:01,807 --> 02:38:03,729
its turn. Vex, you're up.

2214
02:38:03,729 --> 02:38:06,898
LAURA: Can I see its body at all?

2215
02:38:06,898 --> 02:38:11,329
MATT: Yeah, you can see its body, it's pretty
large, mainly just the heads are visible, the ramp

2216
02:38:11,329 --> 02:38:15,688
is blocking the lower half of it. So you can't see
its legs and its main part of its torso, but you

2217
02:38:15,688 --> 02:38:17,396
can see the necks and the heads.

2218
02:38:17,396 --> 02:38:18,856
LAURA: So I can't see its body.

2219
02:38:18,856 --> 02:38:20,941
MATT: Currently, no. It is blocked by her stone.

2220
02:38:20,941 --> 02:38:33,133
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to shoot towards where-- is
this bad? Oh no! I'm going to shoot towards where

2221
02:38:33,133 --> 02:38:36,121
all of the heads are joined together.

2222
02:38:36,121 --> 02:38:42,563
MATT: It managed to unravel itself during its
turn, but it used its attacks to do so.

2223
02:38:42,563 --> 02:38:46,746
LAURA: Yeah, down where all these heads are
connected. Right here.

2224
02:38:46,746 --> 02:38:49,411
MATT: Oh, okay. You can sort of see that area.
Best you can, yeah.

2225
02:38:49,411 --> 02:38:55,003
LAURA: I'm going to shoot my fancy exploding
arrow.

2226
02:38:55,003 --> 02:38:58,549
TALIESIN: The untested?

2227
02:38:58,549 --> 02:39:01,892
MATT: The one that you rolled.

2228
02:39:01,892 --> 02:39:03,846
TALIESIN: The one that has the little mark beside
it?

2229
02:39:03,846 --> 02:39:08,450
MATT: You pull out of your quiver the exploding
arrow, which you can see it, it's heavily weighted

2230
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:13,147
in the front so you know you have to fire it at a
slight arc against most of your arrows that you

2231
02:39:13,147 --> 02:39:16,783
shoot. So go ahead and roll an attack on this
one.

2232
02:39:16,783 --> 02:39:22,942
LAURA: Oh god.

2233
02:39:22,942 --> 02:39:36,052
MATT: What did you roll? Are you serious? As you
pull back on your bow, you go to release it, and

2234
02:39:36,052 --> 02:39:44,916
the string ignites for a second, the arcane fire
behind it that you absentmindedly trigger, and as

2235
02:39:44,916 --> 02:39:48,700
you do you realize at the last minute, the arrow
doesn't fire. You actually freak out for a second

2236
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:53,701
and release the bow. The arrow falls, the flame
hitting the edge of it, and it explodes and

2237
02:39:53,701 --> 02:39:59,271
detonates right in front of you. Make a reflex
saving throw. Sorry, a dexterity saving throw. Oh,

2238
02:39:59,271 --> 02:40:03,848
Pathfinder. You squeak in every now and then.

2239
02:40:03,848 --> 02:40:05,605
LAURA: Natural 20!

2240
02:40:05,605 --> 02:40:08,909
TALIESIN: Now?!

2241
02:40:08,909 --> 02:40:14,202
MARISHA: Fuck you, dice gods.

2242
02:40:14,202 --> 02:40:20,088
MATT: What would have been an explosively painful
38 points of damage is halved.

2243
02:40:20,088 --> 02:40:23,090
TALIESIN: Well, we know it works.

2244
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:29,316
MATT: So you take 19 points of fire damage, and
you're knocked prone.

2245
02:40:29,316 --> 02:40:31,873
TALIESIN: Now, if only I could have attached that
to a donkey, at some point.

2246
02:40:31,873 --> 02:40:36,635
LAURA: You said 19? Jesus.

2247
02:40:36,635 --> 02:40:38,338
MATT: You're knocked flat on your ass.

2248
02:40:38,338 --> 02:40:41,365
LIAM: That was all of Dungeons and Dragons
contained in 30 seconds.

2249
02:40:41,365 --> 02:40:44,085
(laughter)

2250
02:40:44,085 --> 02:40:46,860
TALIESIN: For a year, he tried to get me to design
an exploding donkey.

2251
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:47,993
SAM: I did.

2252
02:40:47,993 --> 02:40:56,301
MATT: That was a little unfortunate. Trinket can
still move and finish off the round, if you'd

2253
02:40:56,301 --> 02:40:58,591
like. That was only one of your attacks.

2254
02:40:58,591 --> 02:41:05,433
LAURA: All right. Can Trinket run up and fight
alongside Grog? All right, he's going to do that.

2255
02:41:05,433 --> 02:41:09,641
MATT: Trinket runs up, runs up the ramp, claws out
(roars).

2256
02:41:09,641 --> 02:41:16,977
LAURA: Gets two attacks because of bestial fury.
Jeez. Okay, I'm going to roll my Trinket dice now.

2257
02:41:16,977 --> 02:41:28,747
Don't kill me now. Okay. I don't even know. 16.

2258
02:41:28,747 --> 02:41:30,631
MATT: 16 does not hit.

2259
02:41:30,631 --> 02:41:34,572
LAURA: Cool. 19.

2260
02:41:34,572 --> 02:41:35,962
MATT: 19 does hit.

2261
02:41:35,962 --> 02:41:44,886
LAURA: All right. (fake-cries) Okay. 13.

2262
02:41:44,886 --> 02:41:46,122
MATT: 13.

2263
02:41:46,122 --> 02:41:47,914
LAURA: Does he get Hunter's Mark?

2264
02:41:47,914 --> 02:41:50,475
MATT: I would say yes, because he is your bear,
I'll let that happen.

2265
02:41:50,475 --> 02:41:53,284
LAURA: Yes he does! That's another five.

2266
02:41:53,284 --> 02:41:57,695
MATT: Nice, so 18 points of damage from Trinket.
As Trinket runs up, one claw swings through the

2267
02:41:57,695 --> 02:42:02,116
air, and as the head rears back, seeing this new
bear that's joined the fray, reaches out and

2268
02:42:02,116 --> 02:42:05,721
clamps onto its throat with its jaws, tearing a
chunk of its flesh out.

2269
02:42:05,721 --> 02:42:07,147
TRAVIS: Yeah, Trinket!

2270
02:42:07,147 --> 02:42:13,949
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Scanlan.

2271
02:42:13,949 --> 02:42:25,181
SAM: I'm going to punch it with Bigby's Hand. I'm
going to do Bigby's Hand. And punch it. That's it.

2272
02:42:25,181 --> 02:42:27,898
Punch. That's my move. Punch.

2273
02:42:27,898 --> 02:42:32,070
MATT: (laughs) Good, let me open the spell real
fast.

2274
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:45,317
SAM: (singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand.
You know it. Shamone.

2275
02:42:45,317 --> 02:42:49,911
MATT: So go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
spell attack.

2276
02:42:49,911 --> 02:42:53,057
SAM: Add my spell attack?

2277
02:42:53,057 --> 02:42:55,064
MATT: Yeah, it should be at the top of your spell
page.

2278
02:42:55,064 --> 02:42:59,766
SAM: This? Spell attack. 21.

2279
02:42:59,766 --> 02:43:04,608
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll 4d8 points of
force damage as the fist slams, clocking one of

2280
02:43:04,608 --> 02:43:06,963
the hydras in the face.

2281
02:43:06,963 --> 02:43:11,223
SAM: 23.

2282
02:43:11,223 --> 02:43:20,336
MATT: 23. And with that, you actually punch one of
the heads off the hydra. It goes spinning off into

2283
02:43:20,336 --> 02:43:21,375
the forest.

2284
02:43:21,375 --> 02:43:24,010
LAURA: Oh, you don't want to punch heads off.

2285
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:35,766
SAM: Hey guys, I got rid of another head! Hey
guys, I'm on a roll! Who still hasn't gone?

2286
02:43:35,766 --> 02:43:37,069
Keyleth, you haven't gone?

2287
02:43:37,069 --> 02:43:38,715
TALIESIN: I haven't gone and Grog hasn't gone.

2288
02:43:38,715 --> 02:43:41,589
SAM: Okay, I'm going to inspire Grog with my bonus
action.

2289
02:43:41,589 --> 02:43:43,144
MATT: Okay, what do you inspire him with?

2290
02:43:43,144 --> 02:43:52,174
SAM: Oh, I'm going to inspire him. (singing) Come
on Grog, yeah, you know what I mean. It's time to

2291
02:43:52,174 --> 02:43:55,651
rage on this hydra...

2292
02:43:55,651 --> 02:44:08,636
MATT: A half-hearted d10 to you. (laughs) All
right, so. As that finishes your turn. At this

2293
02:44:08,636 --> 02:44:15,241
point, you see a series of blurs in the nearby
bushes.

2294
02:44:15,241 --> 02:44:17,194
SAM: Blurs in the bushes!

2295
02:44:17,194 --> 02:44:19,650
LAURA: Blurs from the bush? What?

2296
02:44:19,650 --> 02:44:29,883
MATT: A voice rings out, saying, "Hey! What are
you doing?!" And you now see an armored individual

2297
02:44:29,883 --> 02:44:39,916
come rushing out from behind this tree here,
another armored individual rushing from there, a

2298
02:44:39,916 --> 02:44:47,482
female with a large sword rushing from this side,
another character with leather armor, and a robed

2299
02:44:47,482 --> 02:44:55,445
female coming from behind here. "This is our mark!
You're not supposed to take that from us!"

2300
02:44:55,445 --> 02:44:58,463
LAURA: Well, maybe you should've fought it before
we got here!

2301
02:44:58,463 --> 02:45:02,199
MATT: "This is against the rules, you skag!"

2302
02:45:02,199 --> 02:45:06,906
ORION: Wait, what rules? We don't know the rules!

2303
02:45:06,906 --> 02:45:09,592
MARISHA: We got here first! Warcraft rules!

2304
02:45:09,592 --> 02:45:13,143
ORION: I don't know what that means!

2305
02:45:13,143 --> 02:45:24,851
MATT: So this guy runs forward. He can't quite get
all the way there, so he's going to sit there.

2306
02:45:25,013 --> 02:45:33,086
Mage moves out this way and is going to look over
at you as you're getting the gun, looks over and

2307
02:45:33,086 --> 02:45:41,097
reaches out her hand. Go ahead and make a wisdom
saving throw.

2308
02:45:41,097 --> 02:45:45,333
TALIESIN: Oh my god, for the love of-- no!

2309
02:45:45,333 --> 02:45:47,383
TRAVIS: What did you roll? Say it!

2310
02:45:47,383 --> 02:45:49,352
TALIESIN: One.

2311
02:45:49,352 --> 02:45:54,935
ORION: Hold on. Wait no, hold on. I peek over and
Counterspell.

2312
02:45:54,935 --> 02:46:01,183
MATT: You do not have visual on her at all. The
trees are in between, unfortunately. As you're on

2313
02:46:01,183 --> 02:46:05,945
the flying carpet, you see over the shoulder. You
go to get your gun-- you're trying to pull out Bad

2314
02:46:05,945 --> 02:46:09,465
News-- and then your muscles seize and you find
yourself held in place.

2315
02:46:09,465 --> 02:46:12,484
SAM: Hold Person. Hold Percy.

2316
02:46:12,484 --> 02:46:19,488
MATT: The cleric character you see comes forward,
holding aloft a holy symbol, and reaches up and

2317
02:46:19,488 --> 02:46:25,492
suddenly you see the canopy above the hydra begin
to glow with a bright orange light before a column

2318
02:46:25,492 --> 02:46:28,800
of fire slams down into the ground from the
heavens.

2319
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,390
SAM: On the hydra?

2320
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:31,545
MATT: On the hydra.

2321
02:46:31,545 --> 02:46:33,495
LAURA: Wait, what about the people that are near
the hydra?

2322
02:46:33,495 --> 02:46:36,192
MATT: It appears to only be affecting the hydra.

2323
02:46:36,192 --> 02:46:38,573
LAURA and SAM: Ooh.

2324
02:46:38,573 --> 02:46:41,996
SAM: What is that?

2325
02:46:41,996 --> 02:46:47,347
MATT: The hydra takes 48 points of damage.

2326
02:46:47,347 --> 02:46:49,155
TRAVIS: Four-eight?

2327
02:46:49,155 --> 02:46:55,644
SAM: While you were gone, everything happened, by
the way. Everything happened.

2328
02:46:55,644 --> 02:46:58,276
TRAVIS: We're apparently taking someone's bounty.

2329
02:46:58,276 --> 02:47:06,258
MATT: This character runs up, dressed in leather
armor, hood, cloak. Runs back, pulling two

2330
02:47:06,258 --> 02:47:12,032
longswords from underneath the cloak and swings up
to strike multiple times. You can see a hawk

2331
02:47:12,032 --> 02:47:24,306
gliding over, heading in the canopy. Does 12
points of damage with the first strike. The second

2332
02:47:24,306 --> 02:47:28,547
one, goes to swing and hits the hide and flanks
off of it.

2333
02:47:28,547 --> 02:47:31,543
LAURA: And it explodes in his face and he's 
knocked prone.

2334
02:47:31,543 --> 02:47:36,592
MATT: Sorry. This woman, as she rushes 
forward,

2335
02:47:36,592 --> 02:47:45,045
you can see the skin has a pink-reddish tint,
these blackened twin horns curl to the back of her

2336
02:47:45,045 --> 02:47:49,769
head, and she carries a giant greatsword in her
hands as she runs in a blur, yelling out this

2337
02:47:49,769 --> 02:47:59,041
angry war cry. "It's ours!" Runs up and swings
towards one of the hydra's heads. First one

2338
02:47:59,041 --> 02:48:07,795
misses. Second one misses. (whoosh) In her fury
and anger and the frustration of currently having

2339
02:48:07,795 --> 02:48:13,351
apparently a targeted bounty of theirs taken, she
swings wildly into the air, missing both strikes.

2340
02:48:13,351 --> 02:48:22,709
That's going to end their round. All right, that
brings us to Grog and Percy.

2341
02:48:22,709 --> 02:48:25,308
Percy, make a wisdom saving throw.

2342
02:48:25,308 --> 02:48:28,104
TALIESIN: This is a wisdom modifier plus d20?

2343
02:48:28,104 --> 02:48:29,911
MATT: It's whatever your wisdom save is.

2344
02:48:29,911 --> 02:48:32,067
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2345
02:48:32,067 --> 02:48:44,830
MATT: Ones and twenties tonight. So you manage to
shrug the effect, but that's your turn. Grog.

2346
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:49,388
TRAVIS: I would like to look to the woman that
swung and missed and go, oh, I think you meant to

2347
02:48:49,388 --> 02:48:53,162
do this. And I'll swing for the body of the
hydra.

2348
02:48:53,162 --> 02:48:55,107
MATT: Okay.

2349
02:48:55,107 --> 02:48:56,703
TRAVIS: 24.

2350
02:48:56,703 --> 02:48:58,311
MATT: 24 hits.

2351
02:48:58,311 --> 02:48:59,798
TRAVIS: And 20.

2352
02:48:59,798 --> 02:49:01,210
MATT: 20 hits.

2353
02:49:01,210 --> 02:49:08,044
TRAVIS: Why didn't I use the stupid dice, but
that's okay. 19?

2354
02:49:08,044 --> 02:49:09,678
MATT: 19 damage.

2355
02:49:09,678 --> 02:49:12,991
TRAVIS: And 11.

2356
02:49:12,991 --> 02:49:18,740
MATT: All right. (whack) You hit once again,
almost like you're cutting down a tree. You're

2357
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:23,347
hitting the same mark you hit last turn, carving a
large chunk of the throat out. You can now see the

2358
02:49:23,347 --> 02:49:28,768
exposed bone underneath, and it's starting to
gurgle through its hissing. You bring the axe

2359
02:49:28,768 --> 02:49:33,263
around with the inertia on the backswing and slam
it into the base of another one of the necks. As

2360
02:49:33,263 --> 02:49:37,220
it slams into it and gets wedged in there, you
have to pull it out with a giant spray of blood

2361
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:42,710
that actually spatters across the female tiefling,
which you now see. Who, as it sprays across her,

2362
02:49:42,710 --> 02:49:48,070
she licks it off her pointed teeth, and you can
see she brings her sword up, ready to go ahead and

2363
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:55,713
attack it again. She's glaring at you now with a
this-is-mine type expression. Vax.

2364
02:49:55,713 --> 02:49:59,638
LIAM: All right, so am I still up on the elevated
part of the stone?

2365
02:49:59,638 --> 02:50:01,179
MATT: You are, yes.

2366
02:50:01,179 --> 02:50:09,271
LIAM: The one that's occupied with Grog, I'm going
to jump on it and cling my legs to the side and

2367
02:50:09,271 --> 02:50:21,212
try to slice down as I go, over the side wall.
Okay. First is a 28. I'll just do that. And it's a

2368
02:50:21,212 --> 02:50:27,139
sneak attack because it's occupied with Grog,
obviously. So that is a two-- this is my Keen

2369
02:50:27,139 --> 02:50:44,737
Dagger. That's a nine plus... nine, 13, 16, 19,
24. Nine plus 24 is 33, and then the second

2370
02:50:44,737 --> 02:50:48,732
dagger, Flametongue, nine, ten, 19.

2371
02:50:48,732 --> 02:50:50,510
MATT: All right, that does hit.

2372
02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:56,823
LIAM: Okay, that's a regular old four plus six is
ten, and then out comes the Venom Dagger, which

2373
02:50:56,823 --> 02:51:03,384
has already spit its poison, and that is a 26,
which also hits, and that is a four plus six is

2374
02:51:03,384 --> 02:51:09,653
ten. So (dagger noises) down its neck.

2375
02:51:09,653 --> 02:51:20,784
MATT: All right. As you spin over and arc down
onto the opposite side there, nice. Well done. I

2376
02:51:20,784 --> 02:51:27,205
forgot to roll for-- it does resist the poison at
the end of its turn, by the way. Though even with

2377
02:51:27,205 --> 02:51:33,128
the disadvantage it still managed to hit you last
turn. All right, cool, so you flip over, arc

2378
02:51:33,128 --> 02:51:39,354
yourself down after the series of dagger blades,
carving these two long, ragged wounds down the

2379
02:51:39,354 --> 02:51:43,292
side of its body. As you hit on the opposite side,
where the stonework is starting to crack a little

2380
02:51:43,292 --> 02:51:46,159
bit from the impact and swishing about of its
physical body.

2381
02:51:46,159 --> 02:51:51,136
LIAM: Can I ask, do I have a bonus action at this
point? I'm hasted, and I've done three attacks. Is

2382
02:51:51,136 --> 02:51:53,973
there time for a bonus action? I don't know.

2383
02:51:53,973 --> 02:51:59,167
MATT: You have an attack, bonus action attack, and
then the haste attack.

2384
02:51:59,167 --> 02:52:00,893
LIAM: Okay, I'm good.

2385
02:52:00,893 --> 02:52:02,558
MATT: All right. Keyleth.

2386
02:52:02,558 --> 02:52:09,441
MARISHA: Should I try and get these fuckers off,
or should I just kill the damn thing?

2387
02:52:09,441 --> 02:52:11,528
LAURA: Attack the hydra.

2388
02:52:11,528 --> 02:52:19,746
MARISHA: I cast Call Lightning and bring a
lightning bolt right down on its head.

2389
02:52:19,746 --> 02:52:24,292
MATT: In the same space, you can see there's a
burnt hole in the top of the canopy where that

2390
02:52:24,292 --> 02:52:30,486
fire column came through, there's a slight sizzle
of ozone before a giant hammering blow of

2391
02:52:30,486 --> 02:52:37,240
lightning streaks from the heavens down into the
body. You feel a jolt of energy in the daggers.

2392
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:40,762
You pull them out instinctively before it manages
to make its way to your body.

2393
02:52:40,762 --> 02:52:44,405
Go ahead and roll damage.

2394
02:52:44,405 --> 02:52:51,163
MARISHA: (whoops) Nine, eight, bringing us to 17.
21 damage.

2395
02:52:51,163 --> 02:52:59,324
MATT: 21 damage, nice. All righty. That ends the
round. At the top, where the secondary head you

2396
02:52:59,324 --> 02:53:02,334
blew off was, two more heads sprout out. It now
has seven heads.

2397
02:53:02,334 --> 02:53:05,909
SAM: Hey guys! There's more heads for me to knock
off!

2398
02:53:05,909 --> 02:53:07,772
LAURA: Hey, that's the best thing ever!

2399
02:53:07,772 --> 02:53:09,514
SAM: We get to keep doing it!

2400
02:53:09,514 --> 02:53:13,949
LAURA: I bet if we keep doing it though, I mean,
eventually the heads will outweigh the body and

2401
02:53:13,949 --> 02:53:15,730
it'll just have to fall over.

2402
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:31,956
ORION: Okay, well. He's 20 feet in radius himself,
isn't he? Sweet! I'm going to-- oh, there's a lot

2403
02:53:31,956 --> 02:53:39,165
of people, though. Who are they? I put my ring out
and I'm going to do instantly, quicken spell, do

2404
02:53:39,165 --> 02:53:43,918
five more SP will bring me down to one sorcerer
point, and I'm going to huck two Fireballs right

2405
02:53:43,918 --> 02:53:46,910
in the center of the hydra.

2406
02:53:46,910 --> 02:53:50,261
MATT: Okay. All right.

2407
02:53:50,261 --> 02:53:56,971
ORION: But you're off to the side. You're not on
it. Are you on it?

2408
02:53:56,971 --> 02:54:06,177
MATT: So you're drifting over here? Oh. No, you're
just aiming at it. Okay. So. Back-to-back, you

2409
02:54:06,177 --> 02:54:13,091
used the last of the sorcerer points to fire two
Fireballs that explode, one after another. Go

2410
02:54:13,091 --> 02:54:20,135
ahead and roll damage on both of them.

2411
02:54:20,135 --> 02:54:31,174
ORION: 20-- what is that?-- 29, 31, 35, 36, so
that's 41.

2412
02:54:31,174 --> 02:54:46,798
MATT: 41 for the first one. That's almost straight
sixes and fives. That's awesome.

2413
02:54:46,798 --> 02:54:49,476
ORION: 34, so that's 39.

2414
02:54:49,476 --> 02:54:52,325
MATT: 39. Were you adding five to each of those?

2415
02:54:52,325 --> 02:54:53,442
ORION: Yes.

2416
02:54:53,442 --> 02:54:55,043
MATT: I don't think you're supposed to do that for
Fireball.

2417
02:54:55,043 --> 02:54:56,309
ORION: It's any fire attack.

2418
02:54:56,309 --> 02:55:01,183
MATT: Oh, that's right, because you have the--
never mind. You do. Yes, that's right. I need a

2419
02:55:01,183 --> 02:55:06,331
reflex save from Grog and from you, Vax.

2420
02:55:06,331 --> 02:55:11,890
LIAM: I'm going to do rogue's evasion. I'm going
to use Matt Colville's die

2421
02:55:11,890 --> 02:55:14,278
made of iron from a meteorite.

2422
02:55:14,278 --> 02:55:16,232
SAM: From a meteorite?

2423
02:55:16,232 --> 02:55:18,218
LIAM: Hopefully not die.

2424
02:55:18,218 --> 02:55:20,254
SAM: Wait, from a meteorite?!

2425
02:55:20,254 --> 02:55:23,589
TALIESIN: To be fair, the die didn't dodge the
earth.

2426
02:55:23,589 --> 02:55:33,197
LIAM: What kind of roll is this? Saving throw.
I've rolled a 17.

2427
02:55:33,197 --> 02:55:35,839
MATT: This is a 20-foot radius.

2428
02:55:35,839 --> 02:55:38,113
LAURA: So everything in that area?

2429
02:55:38,113 --> 02:55:45,950
LIAM: Everything in the area. It's done. I rolled
a 17. Is that a success or a failure?

2430
02:55:45,950 --> 02:55:53,460
MATT: What is the, what's your spell difficulty?

2431
02:55:53,460 --> 02:55:56,753
ORION: Spell save? 17.

2432
02:55:56,753 --> 02:55:59,369
MATT: 17, so that just makes it for the first one,
yes.

2433
02:55:59,369 --> 02:56:02,038
LIAM: Just makes it. For the first Fireball?

2434
02:56:02,038 --> 02:56:04,153
MATT: For the first Fireball, yeah. You avoid that
entirely.

2435
02:56:04,153 --> 02:56:05,952
LIAM: Do I need to roll again? We're all going to
roll again in a moment?

2436
02:56:05,952 --> 02:56:08,758
MATT: Yep. Roll for the second one now. Because
two exploded in a row.

2437
02:56:08,758 --> 02:56:11,234
LIAM: Oh, now. That is less.

2438
02:56:11,234 --> 02:56:14,886
ORION: Oh, hold on a second. Wait. I want to put a
pause on this real quick.

2439
02:56:14,886 --> 02:56:16,728
LAURA: You can't. You already did it!

2440
02:56:16,728 --> 02:56:20,902
ORION: I asked the question before I cast the
spell. Is the hydra itself 20-foot radius? And I

2441
02:56:20,902 --> 02:56:22,903
got a nod, so I figured my spell--

2442
02:56:22,903 --> 02:56:32,476
MATT: The hydra itself, the creature, it's a
15-foot diameter.

2443
02:56:32,476 --> 02:56:33,716
ORION: Diameter.

2444
02:56:33,716 --> 02:56:36,660
MATT: A radius is from the outside of it, from the
middle.

2445
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:39,995
ORION: Radius is different from diameter? Okay.

2446
02:56:39,995 --> 02:56:41,385
SAM: Geometry, kids.

2447
02:56:41,385 --> 02:56:43,889
ORION: Well then, it's fine, I'll shift it
closer--

2448
02:56:43,889 --> 02:56:51,298
LIAM: It's done. This is why this is interesting.
So I succeeded the first time. I failed the second

2449
02:56:51,298 --> 02:56:54,688
time, which means I halve whatever the damage is,
which is high.

2450
02:56:54,688 --> 02:56:59,296
MATT: Okay, you take 18 points of fire damage.

2451
02:56:59,296 --> 02:57:00,774
LIAM: That's okay.

2452
02:57:00,774 --> 02:57:02,409
MATT: Grog? Two saves.

2453
02:57:02,409 --> 02:57:04,408
TRAVIS: What am I rolling, sorry?

2454
02:57:04,408 --> 02:57:06,803
SAM: You're trying to beat 17.

2455
02:57:06,803 --> 02:57:08,310
TRAVIS: Oh, I rolled a 14, plus anything?

2456
02:57:08,310 --> 02:57:10,073
SAM: Yeah, you've got inspiration, friend.

2457
02:57:10,073 --> 02:57:11,322
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do!

2458
02:57:11,322 --> 02:57:14,941
ORION: Plus his what?

2459
02:57:14,941 --> 02:57:18,078
TRAVIS: Proficiency or what?

2460
02:57:18,078 --> 02:57:20,310
MATT: It's whatever your dex saving throw is.

2461
02:57:20,310 --> 02:57:22,250
TRAVIS: Oh. Two. So 16, plus--

2462
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:24,151
LAURA: So 18 for the first one.

2463
02:57:24,151 --> 02:57:25,329
TRAVIS: 18 for the first one.

2464
02:57:25,329 --> 02:57:28,268
MATT: 18. So you take 22 points of fire damage.

2465
02:57:28,268 --> 02:57:30,816
LIAM: Where did all that math go from the last
game?

2466
02:57:30,816 --> 02:57:35,534
TRAVIS: Nine.

2467
02:57:35,534 --> 02:57:37,614
SAM: Nine?

2468
02:57:37,614 --> 02:57:38,764
TRAVIS: Nine.

2469
02:57:38,764 --> 02:57:40,678
TALIESIN: You can take it.

2470
02:57:40,678 --> 02:57:42,566
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it. I'm all good.

2471
02:57:42,566 --> 02:57:47,308
MATT: Here's the other side of it, though. We'll
get to it in a second. Nine? You take 39 points of

2472
02:57:47,308 --> 02:57:48,604
fire damage.

2473
02:57:48,604 --> 02:57:53,702
LAURA: I don't want to say it, but Trinket's right
there.

2474
02:57:53,702 --> 02:57:56,922
MATT: Oh yeah. Roll a saving throw for Trinket.

2475
02:57:56,922 --> 02:57:59,013
SAM: No, remember? I said leave Trinket behind?

2476
02:57:59,013 --> 02:58:02,053
LAURA: Yeah, I know you said that, but he also
attacked him already.

2477
02:58:02,053 --> 02:58:04,388
MATT: Roll a saving throw for Trinket.

2478
02:58:04,388 --> 02:58:08,457
LIAM: Come on, Trinket die. Oh my god. Okay.

2479
02:58:08,457 --> 02:58:09,586
LAURA: Don't say it.

2480
02:58:09,586 --> 02:58:10,654
LIAM: No, it's good.

2481
02:58:10,654 --> 02:58:12,251
LAURA: 17 for the first one.

2482
02:58:12,251 --> 02:58:19,212
MATT: Okay, that just makes it. So Trinket takes
22 fire damage. All right,

2483
02:58:19,212 --> 02:58:20,819
and then the second one?

2484
02:58:20,819 --> 02:58:25,282
MARISHA: I'm eating so much sugar, compulsively,
out of nerves.

2485
02:58:25,282 --> 02:58:28,241
LAURA: It's stuck in there.

2486
02:58:28,241 --> 02:58:31,390
LIAM: Oh wow, it's not either, it's really on an
angle.

2487
02:58:31,390 --> 02:58:33,970
LAURA: It was really on an angle. That's
unfortunate because one of them was good, and one

2488
02:58:33,970 --> 02:58:35,259
of them sucked.

2489
02:58:35,259 --> 02:58:37,186
MATT: So what did you roll?

2490
02:58:37,186 --> 02:58:38,256
LAURA: Seven.

2491
02:58:38,256 --> 02:58:42,135
MATT: Seven, all right. So with the explosion,
both explode out of the way. You both manage to

2492
02:58:42,135 --> 02:58:46,907
avoid the brunt of the damage. Trinket falls
unconscious on the ground, the smell of burnt

2493
02:58:46,907 --> 02:58:55,322
hair. The hydra looks rough. However, the
individuals also nearby that came in are also

2494
02:58:55,322 --> 02:59:04,220
blasted back by the Fireball. Everyone but the
cleric and the mage in there are hit with the

2495
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:08,474
double explosions. Everyone taking full damage
except for him, who takes half on the first one.

2496
02:59:08,474 --> 02:59:12,207
They all of a sudden look around, dazed and
frustrated.

2497
02:59:12,207 --> 02:59:15,848
SAM: Yeah, we just set off a nuke on the thing.

2498
02:59:15,848 --> 02:59:25,301
MATT: The hydra, due to the fiery impact,
collapses inside the stone structure.

2499
02:59:25,301 --> 02:59:27,475
SAM and MARISHA: Dead?

2500
02:59:27,475 --> 02:59:31,134
MATT: Dead. So how do you want to do this?

2501
02:59:31,134 --> 02:59:33,463
MARISHA: Our kill!

2502
02:59:33,463 --> 02:59:35,124
ORION: Oh my god.

2503
02:59:35,124 --> 02:59:36,810
LIAM: With casualties.

2504
02:59:36,810 --> 02:59:50,036
ORION: Before the last one reaches it, I actually
cast really hard Control Flame. It totally doesn't

2505
02:59:50,036 --> 02:59:56,462
work this way, but I do it anyway. You bastard, I
didn't mean to do this! And I'm going to hammer

2506
02:59:56,462 --> 03:00:00,939
like I did with Flaming Sphere when we were
playing in private.

2507
03:00:00,939 --> 03:00:07,688
MATT: I'll say you do this. You set off the first
Fireball. As it explodes and damages everyone in

2508
03:00:07,688 --> 03:00:12,721
the radius, it blows one of the throats of the
hydra apart. The heads are now caught on fire. As

2509
03:00:12,721 --> 03:00:18,011
you take the second Fireball, you set it off,
shouting that outward. You use Control Flame at

2510
03:00:18,011 --> 03:00:22,236
the same time as the Telekinesis you're still
maintaining to envelop the explosion of the

2511
03:00:22,236 --> 03:00:26,815
Fireball and contain it in the center. You slam it
and let it detonate as part of the impact into the

2512
03:00:26,815 --> 03:00:31,239
torso, where the heads are currently attached. You
end up blowing half the heads off the hydra in the

2513
03:00:31,239 --> 03:00:35,650
process. The rest of its body's trying to keep
itself standing up. However, the explosion itself

2514
03:00:35,650 --> 03:00:40,568
sent the stone wall around you guys broken into
pieces and shards now sticking upward. The hydra

2515
03:00:40,568 --> 03:00:47,272
backs up and falls onto its side, impaling itself
on the shattered stone wall that you had kept up

2516
03:00:47,272 --> 03:00:52,960
as it slowly slides down on the wound and gurgles
out its last life breath, the rest of its body on

2517
03:00:52,960 --> 03:00:55,939
fire, slowly sinking to the base of the stone
wall.

2518
03:00:55,939 --> 03:00:58,313
ORION: That was really cool.

2519
03:00:58,313 --> 03:01:01,067
TRAVIS: Who can heal really a lot really fast?

2520
03:01:01,067 --> 03:01:07,900
LAURA: Trinket! I get up and run over to Trinket
and hold his little head in my hands.

2521
03:01:07,900 --> 03:01:09,384
MARISHA: Who's bad?

2522
03:01:09,384 --> 03:01:11,180
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Trinket's unconscious.

2523
03:01:11,180 --> 03:01:18,049
MARISHA: I run up to Trinket and I cast Cure
Wounds on Trinket in a 3rd-level spell slot.

2524
03:01:18,049 --> 03:01:19,273
MATT: All right.

2525
03:01:19,273 --> 03:01:21,896
LAURA: Help him!

2526
03:01:21,896 --> 03:01:25,756
TRAVIS: He's going to be fine.

2527
03:01:25,756 --> 03:01:27,981
MATT: As you guys rush up--

2528
03:01:27,981 --> 03:01:33,703
LIAM: Yeah, Vax is rolling down the corpse of the
hydra to stand in front of these strangers.

2529
03:01:33,703 --> 03:01:36,301
TRAVIS: I've rushed to Trinket's side, too, from
where I'm at.

2530
03:01:36,301 --> 03:01:40,435
MATT: All right. You're right at Trinket's side.
You're flying in here.

2531
03:01:40,435 --> 03:01:47,021
SAM: I get closer and do the Superbowl shuffle in
front of our new visitors,

2532
03:01:47,021 --> 03:01:49,801
like, yeah, that's what we did.

2533
03:01:49,801 --> 03:01:52,069
MARISHA: Trinket heals for 21 damage.

2534
03:01:52,069 --> 03:01:55,005
MATT: Trinket gets up, charred but okay.

2535
03:01:55,005 --> 03:01:56,596
MARISHA: Who else is bad?

2536
03:01:56,596 --> 03:02:01,907
MATT: Trinket looks over at Tiberius and gives you
a glare.

2537
03:02:01,907 --> 03:02:08,182
MARISHA: I use it again for Vax. Ooh, that's
better.

2538
03:02:08,182 --> 03:02:10,248
TRAVIS: I rolled two hit dice--

2539
03:02:10,248 --> 03:02:13,504
MATT: Well, you aren't at a short rest yet.
Because right now, as you guys are just standing

2540
03:02:13,504 --> 03:02:21,145
there, the rest of the other party is now stepping
up to you. The main human you now see in armor. He

2541
03:02:21,145 --> 03:02:29,037
has dirty blond short hair, little bit of stubble
on the chin, very well-armored, and the armor

2542
03:02:29,037 --> 03:02:35,910
itself looks like it's taken a beating. He steps
up and says, "All right. I'm going to ask you a

2543
03:02:35,910 --> 03:02:41,926
"question. What the <i>fuck</i> are you doing?!"

2544
03:02:41,926 --> 03:02:47,867
LIAM: I think we're killing a hydra. What are you
doing today?

2545
03:02:47,867 --> 03:02:50,269
MATT: "Fulfilling my contract."

2546
03:02:50,269 --> 03:02:53,432
SAM: Oh, by not killing the hydra? Because that's
what you just did.

2547
03:02:53,432 --> 03:03:00,123
LIAM: Listen, we don't know what the fuck you're
doing. Take the hydra. We're not here for a

2548
03:03:00,123 --> 03:03:01,693
bounty; we're trying to help the city.

2549
03:03:01,693 --> 03:03:03,423
LAURA: Well, no, give us the money.

2550
03:03:03,423 --> 03:03:06,329
MARISHA: We did want some proof.

2551
03:03:06,329 --> 03:03:08,699
MATT: He looks back to the rest of the group and
the cleric steps forward and touches his shoulder

2552
03:03:08,699 --> 03:03:15,010
for a second. Shrugs it off and says, "No! No.
Skags that wander these lands, taking creatures

2553
03:03:15,010 --> 03:03:20,117
"from underneath those who are lawfully permitted
to hunt these beasts and take that bounty, and

2554
03:03:20,117 --> 03:03:22,960
"that makes you breakers of the law of
Vasselheim."

2555
03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:27,247
SAM: What's your name, sir?

2556
03:03:27,247 --> 03:03:32,683
MATT: Turns over and looks toward you, takes a
couple steps forward, leaping off of the broken

2557
03:03:32,683 --> 03:03:40,268
stonework on this side. "Aldor. And I work for the
Slayer's Take, those of us that are empowered to

2558
03:03:40,268 --> 03:03:48,509
"hunt contracted bounty-given beasts and creatures
in this land. You have gone out and laid claim to

2559
03:03:48,509 --> 03:03:51,283
"a beast that you had no lawful right to."

2560
03:03:51,283 --> 03:03:56,745
LAURA: Well, the Bastion up on the wall said we
could, so that's why we did it.

2561
03:03:56,745 --> 03:04:03,060
MARISHA: While all of this is going down, I'm
going to casually walk over and open my little

2562
03:04:03,060 --> 03:04:06,462
harvesting book and start harvesting some hydra
blood.

2563
03:04:06,462 --> 03:04:13,260
MATT: As you attempt to do that, the mage walks up
and goes, "I wouldn't recommend that." You can see

2564
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:18,193
her elven face, there is a glare of frustration
and standoffishness that is very sincere.

2565
03:04:18,193 --> 03:04:20,491
"Do not step closer."

2566
03:04:20,491 --> 03:04:25,558
TRAVIS: I'd put your hand down. You see, I had a
horrible day yesterday, and unless you want to end

2567
03:04:25,558 --> 03:04:31,050
up like puppy-dog here, we'll all end up in a big
pile of blood, unless you find a way to split your

2568
03:04:31,050 --> 03:04:35,075
take with us, and maybe let us go on our way. You
see, we're new in these parts,

2569
03:04:35,075 --> 03:04:37,859
and we have a habit for killing.

2570
03:04:37,859 --> 03:04:39,785
MATT: "Who would pay you?"

2571
03:04:39,785 --> 03:04:41,601
LAURA: What do you mean?

2572
03:04:41,601 --> 03:04:45,615
MATT: "Where were you going to take this creature
for the bounty you keep speaking of?"

2573
03:04:45,615 --> 03:04:47,391
LIAM: Which one is talking?

2574
03:04:47,391 --> 03:04:49,789
MATT: This is Aldor, the same human fighter.

2575
03:04:49,789 --> 03:04:53,316
LAURA: Aldor, they told us we could kill it and
then give the heads and then bring it in and then

2576
03:04:53,316 --> 03:04:54,835
they would give us money...

2577
03:04:54,835 --> 03:04:59,346
SAM: We didn't think this through. Listen. Let's
level with you. This whole escapade was not very

2578
03:04:59,346 --> 03:05:06,136
well thought out. We're new in town. We don't want
to step on any toes. We did you a solid; we killed

2579
03:05:06,136 --> 03:05:10,341
your thing. Let's calm it down a notch and let's
just talk, shall we?

2580
03:05:10,341 --> 03:05:14,351
LAURA: Why don't you just tell people you killed
it, we helped, you get the money, you give us half

2581
03:05:14,351 --> 03:05:16,184
of it, and we call it even?

2582
03:05:16,184 --> 03:05:18,042
LIAM: Otherwise, we're going to go right now.

2583
03:05:18,042 --> 03:05:24,396
MATT: He laughs to himself and looks back at the
rest of them and says, "You have to understand.

2584
03:05:24,396 --> 03:05:35,375
"The Slayer's Take's contracts are binding.
Magically. If we don't take this creature in after

2585
03:05:35,375 --> 03:05:41,430
"dealing the killing blow, we're at an impasse with
the Slayer's Take."

2586
03:05:41,430 --> 03:05:48,969
LAURA: Oh. Can you stab it right now? Maybe it's
still breathing?

2587
03:05:48,969 --> 03:05:51,672
LIAM: Can anybody heal it? Can you kill it again?

2588
03:05:51,672 --> 03:06:03,807
MATT: The cleric steps forward, this human cleric,
older, whitish hair. Steps forward, his mace at

2589
03:06:03,807 --> 03:06:09,710
his side, armor currently spattered with hydra
blood, looking a little charred, but for the most

2590
03:06:09,710 --> 03:06:20,055
part okay. He says, "Okay. Before this gets out of
hand, perhaps if you come with us to the Slayer's

2591
03:06:20,055 --> 03:06:26,401
"Take, there would be a possibility of us still
enacting this contract if we find a way to

2592
03:06:26,401 --> 03:06:35,861
"magically bind you to it. Now, mind you, I don't
know how the funds would be legally distributed;

2593
03:06:35,861 --> 03:06:40,529
"however, if you talked to the leader of our order,
perhaps there could be

2594
03:06:40,529 --> 03:06:42,613
"some sort of a resolution to this."

2595
03:06:42,613 --> 03:06:49,800
SAM: What funds are we talking about, here? What
was the contract that you had been binded by?

2596
03:06:49,800 --> 03:06:55,511
MATT: They look at each other and take a step back
defensively and say, "We don't discuss money

2597
03:06:55,511 --> 03:06:58,536
"matters out in the open where it's so easy for
bodies to be hidden."

2598
03:06:58,536 --> 03:07:01,084
TRAVIS: Who is this leader of yours?

2599
03:07:01,084 --> 03:07:09,350
MATT: "The one that you're looking for... is on
the other page."

2600
03:07:09,350 --> 03:07:15,532
(laughter)

2601
03:07:15,532 --> 03:07:17,538
SAM: Aldor is no longer talking, right?

2602
03:07:17,538 --> 03:07:20,820
LAURA: No, Sean Connery's talking now. I'm sorry.

2603
03:07:20,820 --> 03:07:22,215
MATT: "The Huntmaster."

2604
03:07:22,215 --> 03:07:23,845
(laughter)

2605
03:07:23,845 --> 03:07:25,181
SAM: That's your leader?

2606
03:07:25,181 --> 03:07:27,648
LIAM: I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.

2607
03:07:27,648 --> 03:07:29,938
MATT: "Are you taunting me?"

2608
03:07:29,938 --> 03:07:37,081
LIAM: I'm sorry. Not at all. Listen, we were about
to come to blows. You and I are going to work this

2609
03:07:37,081 --> 03:07:41,213
out. Words are mightier than the sword, right?

2610
03:07:41,213 --> 03:07:45,421
SAM: Don't ever do that again.

2611
03:07:45,421 --> 03:07:52,131
TRAVIS: What if we return, saying that you had
acquired our

2612
03:07:52,131 --> 03:07:54,976
services in the killing of this beast?

2613
03:07:54,976 --> 03:07:57,562
SAM: We were subcontracted to you, yes.

2614
03:07:57,562 --> 03:08:03,617
MATT: "The only way that would work is if you were
contracted to the Slayer's Take beforehand, which

2615
03:08:03,617 --> 03:08:14,331
"if you were to agree to be inducted, perhaps that
would alleviate the concern. We could then write

2616
03:08:14,331 --> 03:08:20,528
"you into the contract magically, share the funds,
even, and you would be free to accept contracts to

2617
03:08:20,528 --> 03:08:22,202
"kill creatures at your leisure."

2618
03:08:22,202 --> 03:08:28,132
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, a little clarification. We get
paid to kill?

2619
03:08:28,132 --> 03:08:35,723
MATT: "We're not out here for fun." At which point
the tiefling female behind him says, "Hah, say

2620
03:08:35,723 --> 03:08:41,990
"that yourself. I'm out here for both." She flicks
her sword and the blood across the ground.

2621
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:48,249
TRAVIS: Are you in the company or know of Siren?

2622
03:08:48,249 --> 03:08:55,173
MATT: They all look at each other. "She's been
known to do work with the Slayer's Take, yes."

2623
03:08:55,173 --> 03:08:56,997
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm definitely in.

2624
03:08:56,997 --> 03:08:59,083
SAM: Introduce yourselves, if you don't mind.

2625
03:08:59,083 --> 03:09:05,324
MATT: "Let's do that as we walk." At which point
the cleric says, "Take the heads, cleave them off.

2626
03:09:05,324 --> 03:09:08,204
"We'll take them back as trophies to prove the
contract is sealed."

2627
03:09:08,204 --> 03:09:16,368
The leader, Aldor, says, "Very well. Clean your
weapons. No funny business. A single moment of

2628
03:09:16,368 --> 03:09:20,656
"your eyes wandering to your blade. I don't want it
to have to come to blows.

2629
03:09:20,656 --> 03:09:22,434
"Let's carve up this creature."

2630
03:09:22,434 --> 03:09:26,849
SAM: Oh, what will you do to us? What you did to
the hydra? Oh no! Not kill us.

2631
03:09:26,849 --> 03:09:32,608
MATT: "I really, really don't like you."

2632
03:09:32,608 --> 03:09:35,581
SAM: Few people do.

2633
03:09:35,581 --> 03:09:39,900
LIAM: You don't have to worry about that. We're
out here helping the city for the sake of good,

2634
03:09:39,900 --> 03:09:41,649
not earning a paycheck.

2635
03:09:41,649 --> 03:09:46,295
LAURA: I mean, I was going to ask them for a
paycheck immediately after we'd gone back to the

2636
03:09:46,295 --> 03:09:48,156
city, but you know.

2637
03:09:48,156 --> 03:09:49,610
LIAM: That's how you roll.

2638
03:09:49,610 --> 03:09:56,686
MATT: "There's a very lucrative trade on
monster-hunting in these woods, but you have to

2639
03:09:56,686 --> 03:10:01,352
"make sure that you're certified. Otherwise, you're
taking money and food out of the mouths of us and

2640
03:10:01,352 --> 03:10:02,544
"our families."

2641
03:10:02,544 --> 03:10:04,471
LIAM: Certification is key.

2642
03:10:04,471 --> 03:10:08,707
MATT: "Come on. Gather up the creature's bits."
And they all go to start carving

2643
03:10:08,707 --> 03:10:10,310
into the body of the hydra.

2644
03:10:10,310 --> 03:10:11,758
LAURA: Ooh, can we help?

2645
03:10:11,758 --> 03:10:14,050
MARISHA: Now I start doing my thing.

2646
03:10:14,050 --> 03:10:15,865
LIAM: I've got the naughty bits.

2647
03:10:15,865 --> 03:10:17,588
MARISHA: Do I need to roll for this?

2648
03:10:17,588 --> 03:10:24,275
MATT: You don't have to, actually. The group are
very well trained, and as you go to try to, the

2649
03:10:24,275 --> 03:10:33,509
tiefling puts her hand down and starts tearing
pieces out. There's a dominance, a standoff here.

2650
03:10:33,509 --> 03:10:35,468
LAURA: Can I have a scale? Just one more scale?

2651
03:10:35,468 --> 03:10:37,623
MARISHA: I want some stuff.

2652
03:10:37,623 --> 03:10:40,521
SAM: It's all right. We'll get it and we'll figure
it out when we get there.

2653
03:10:40,521 --> 03:10:45,501
MATT: There seems to be a general feel here that
you've already broken the law enough. If you

2654
03:10:45,501 --> 03:10:46,711
really want to fight for it, you can.

2655
03:10:46,711 --> 03:10:48,391
LIAM: Let's quit while we're ahead.

2656
03:10:48,391 --> 03:10:51,186
SAM: Yeah, let's deal with the naughty bits
later.

2657
03:10:51,186 --> 03:10:55,650
MATT: It takes about half an hour or so to reap
the bits and pieces, then again making your way

2658
03:10:55,650 --> 03:11:01,325
back, after you've pushed the remainder of the
body into the pool itself, letting it slowly sink

2659
03:11:01,325 --> 03:11:09,508
to the bottom. You all make your way back the path
you came in an awkward, quiet march.

2660
03:11:09,508 --> 03:11:13,656
LAURA: Oh, you guys set that bait out. You guys
killed that ape, didn't you?

2661
03:11:13,656 --> 03:11:19,559
MATT: Aldor gives you a look. "Good to know we
aren't the only trackers in this town."

2662
03:11:19,559 --> 03:11:25,746
TALIESIN: That's so clever. Clever girl.

2663
03:11:25,746 --> 03:11:30,589
MATT: Eventually make your way back to town, skirt
around the outer wall to one of the three main

2664
03:11:30,589 --> 03:11:40,130
gates, this one right on the outskirts of the
Braving (stutters). Too many creatures. Braving

2665
03:11:40,130 --> 03:11:48,327
Grounds. The gates open. You're all led in, first
question at the sight of you guys, but Aldor

2666
03:11:48,327 --> 03:11:53,595
raises his hand and says, "No, they're with us;
it's fine." You all walk in, leads you to the

2667
03:11:53,595 --> 03:11:57,416
outskirts of the Braving Grounds to a new area of
the town you have yet to travel to. At which

2668
03:11:57,416 --> 03:12:09,619
point, he introduces, "Welcome to the Quad Roads.
This is where the Slayer's Take makes its place.

2669
03:12:09,619 --> 03:12:19,329
"This is also where the Erathis's Crown is. Best
you pay an homage to the

2670
03:12:19,329 --> 03:12:21,863
"deity of civilization while here."

2671
03:12:21,863 --> 03:12:26,219
He pulls out a small gem around his neck with a
small symbol on it, kisses it, and puts it back in

2672
03:12:26,219 --> 03:12:32,527
his shirt. You guys continue walking to what is
now, you can see these large roads that streak

2673
03:12:32,527 --> 03:12:36,965
across. You've seen them join with the other
sections. This is the most central of all the

2674
03:12:36,965 --> 03:12:44,351
various districts of the city of Vasselheim. There
is a very large trade bazaar structure not that

2675
03:12:44,351 --> 03:12:49,107
far out of the main gate that leads to the center
of this district. You can see barkers shouting out

2676
03:12:49,107 --> 03:12:59,213
left and right to you, various phrases dealing
with food and various crops, and creature fresh

2677
03:12:59,213 --> 03:13:07,798
meat. "Fresh meat out of the Abundance! Takers of
the Abundance!" And people yelling out for general

2678
03:13:07,798 --> 03:13:13,801
goods, packs, leathers, large carts being wheeled
past you, until eventually you make your way to

2679
03:13:13,801 --> 03:13:24,627
what looks like a very old, dark-wood lodge, about
three stories high, decorated with dozens of tusks

2680
03:13:24,627 --> 03:13:30,525
and claws and other trophies that look as old as
the building itself. A carved wooden sign stands

2681
03:13:30,525 --> 03:13:36,898
bolted to the top of the porch that says "Slayer's
Take Guildhall" in the common tongue. Approaching

2682
03:13:36,898 --> 03:13:42,669
the door, still that awkward quiet keeping over
the group, there is an engraving into the

2683
03:13:42,669 --> 03:13:48,520
doorway-- it's pushed into the wood-- that reads,
"Here is where the hunters gather, keen eyes and

2684
03:13:48,520 --> 03:13:53,777
"blades at ready. We cease the unknown's cackling
laughter. Our will is strong, our members plenty.

2685
03:13:53,777 --> 03:14:00,133
"We stand against the tide of darkness. We do the
deeds few men can handle. Reap forth a trophy from

2686
03:14:00,133 --> 03:14:03,658
"the carcass. We are your strength, we are your
candle."

2687
03:14:03,658 --> 03:14:11,761
Aldor does a knock on the door. The door opens, an
eye looks through, and the door swiftly opens as

2688
03:14:11,761 --> 03:14:18,121
another individual who's dressed in a makeshift
leather and hide armor steps aside. You're all let

2689
03:14:18,243 --> 03:14:22,291
in, carrying the large hydra heads through that
have been gathering looks from the individuals

2690
03:14:22,291 --> 03:14:29,948
watching you charge through the streets. To the center of the
room, you see what looks to be amongst the loose

2691
03:14:29,948 --> 03:14:36,315
cast-iron candelabras that are affixed to the
rafters, small candles flicker for the interior

2692
03:14:36,315 --> 03:14:43,705
light, you see a long desk where a halfling male
of muscular build sits eagerly rubbing his hands

2693
03:14:43,705 --> 03:14:48,200
together, his harsh features and light scars
dotting his face and hands, his red hair showing

2694
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:53,399
tinges of grey. His shifting smile belies a
youthful vigor as you approach with the trophies.

2695
03:14:53,399 --> 03:15:01,951
"Aldor! Welcome back. How goes that bleeding
mess-headed beast?

2696
03:15:01,951 --> 03:15:04,092
"I see you seem to have dropped it before you."

2697
03:15:04,092 --> 03:15:09,483
Aldor takes the first head that he's carrying and
chucks it to the ground. As it rolls across with

2698
03:15:09,483 --> 03:15:13,292
two large thuds, the rest of the congealed liquid
seeping into the wood.

2699
03:15:13,292 --> 03:15:20,524
"Aye, that's true, but we
bring a bit of an obstruction in the way."

2700
03:15:20,524 --> 03:15:29,676
Glances to the rest of you. "Obstruction, you say.
Okay. Well, this is a curious phrase. Please

2701
03:15:29,676 --> 03:15:32,879
"explain to me what has occurred in your outing on
this contract."

2702
03:15:32,879 --> 03:15:41,594
Aldor scratches the side of his face. "Well, it
seems that we have a group of skags."

2703
03:15:41,594 --> 03:15:44,232
LAURA: Not intentional. Skags.

2704
03:15:44,232 --> 03:15:50,402
MATT: "Not intentional skags out of the forest,
intending to hunt and managed to deal the killing

2705
03:15:50,402 --> 03:15:52,220
"blow to our mark."

2706
03:15:52,220 --> 03:15:54,161
ORION: Actually, I did that.

2707
03:15:54,161 --> 03:16:04,634
MATT: "This one did it." He wipes some of the soot
off his face. "Amongst other issues."

2708
03:16:04,634 --> 03:16:06,980
ORION: Sorry. My aim was off.

2709
03:16:06,980 --> 03:16:11,740
LIAM: We've come from Emon. We're not exactly
familiar with the customs and traditions of your

2710
03:16:11,740 --> 03:16:18,998
city. We were merely trying to help. My friend may
have slaughtered the hydra-- unintentionally, of

2711
03:16:18,998 --> 03:16:25,871
course. We're hoping to somehow fit into your
society. Not sure how that works.

2712
03:16:25,871 --> 03:16:27,497
Maybe you can help?

2713
03:16:27,497 --> 03:16:35,064
MATT: The halfling walks from behind his desk with
his hands behind his back. (laughs) "You come from

2714
03:16:35,064 --> 03:16:38,660
"Emon. You are not familiar with Vasselheim, yet
the first thing you do upon arriving is leap down

2715
03:16:38,660 --> 03:16:42,835
"to the Vesper Timberland, fighting a freaking
hydra."

2716
03:16:42,835 --> 03:16:45,011
LAURA: It was attacking the wall. We were
protecting you.

2717
03:16:45,011 --> 03:16:48,057
LIAM: A hydra attacking your city. We were merely
following our conscience.

2718
03:16:48,057 --> 03:16:52,588
MATT: "No, this is okay. I like the balls you all
have. This is ridiculous, what you've done."

2719
03:16:52,588 --> 03:16:54,193
LAURA: I have enormous balls.

2720
03:16:54,193 --> 03:16:55,951
MARISHA: Yep, we both do.

2721
03:16:55,951 --> 03:16:58,153
LIAM: See? They're massive.

2722
03:16:58,153 --> 03:17:06,591
MATT: He steps away. "Lady. I appreciate your
brashness, but I would hope

2723
03:17:06,591 --> 03:17:08,762
"that you also act like a lady."

2724
03:17:08,762 --> 03:17:11,616
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh.

2725
03:17:11,616 --> 03:17:13,347
MARISHA: That's a high standard.

2726
03:17:13,347 --> 03:17:15,816
LIAM: Careful where you're walking, little man.

2727
03:17:15,816 --> 03:17:21,160
MATT: "All I say is I appreciate-- yes, your bear
is quite fierce."

2728
03:17:21,160 --> 03:17:23,163
LAURA: He's got giant balls, as well.

2729
03:17:23,163 --> 03:17:28,494
MATT: He reaches past and looks to the wall and
you see there are two dire bear heads affixed to

2730
03:17:28,494 --> 03:17:30,807
the wall of various ancient degrees.

2731
03:17:30,807 --> 03:17:32,716
MARISHA: Don't look, Trinket. Don't look.

2732
03:17:32,716 --> 03:17:41,624
MATT: "Well. I can see that you may have breached
the contract here, and there may be ways of

2733
03:17:41,624 --> 03:17:47,378
"perhaps rectifying this, should you take the
pledge. The pledge itself is a process, one that I

2734
03:17:47,378 --> 03:17:55,623
"myself cannot specifically judge upon. This would
have to go to my boss, the Headmaster. My wife."

2735
03:17:55,623 --> 03:17:58,807
(laughter)

2736
03:17:58,807 --> 03:18:00,353
LIAM: I feel you.

2737
03:18:00,353 --> 03:18:02,134
TRAVIS: Respect.

2738
03:18:02,134 --> 03:18:04,304
MATT: "I will see if she is available. One
moment."

2739
03:18:04,304 --> 03:18:06,591
And the halfling patters off down a hallway.

2740
03:18:06,591 --> 03:18:08,705
LIAM: That is fucking awesome.

2741
03:18:08,705 --> 03:18:10,627
LAURA: That would be amazing.

2742
03:18:10,627 --> 03:18:14,783
MATT: Came back a few moments later. "She would
like to see the skags now."

2743
03:18:14,783 --> 03:18:18,471
SAM: What is with skags? Just call us people,
please?

2744
03:18:18,471 --> 03:18:22,314
TRAVIS: We have a name. Vox Machina.

2745
03:18:22,314 --> 03:18:24,344
LIAM: Perhaps you've heard of us.

2746
03:18:24,344 --> 03:18:25,573
LAURA: Remember it.

2747
03:18:25,573 --> 03:18:33,130
MATT: "I have heard of it not before. I will call
you this upon you making the pledge. Until then,

2748
03:18:33,130 --> 03:18:35,852
"you are a group of forest-walking skags."

2749
03:18:35,852 --> 03:18:37,045
SAM: All right.

2750
03:18:37,045 --> 03:18:44,809
MATT: You follow him into the back hallway, down
past a series of doors, some of which are

2751
03:18:44,809 --> 03:18:51,554
half-open and ajar. You see what appear to be
bunks or rooms for rest. There are some shields

2752
03:18:51,554 --> 03:18:58,075
and various old weapons set up as decor against
the wooden hallways. Down to a large, heavy door

2753
03:18:58,075 --> 03:19:02,821
that looks like it's actually, the red leather
stretched across it, nailed across all parts of

2754
03:19:02,821 --> 03:19:09,571
the doorway, with a branded symbol in the center.
The same symbol that you saw adorning the, almost

2755
03:19:09,571 --> 03:19:16,323
like a relief behind the Slayer's Take lodge
entranceway sign. As the door opens, the halfling

2756
03:19:16,323 --> 03:19:19,117
pushing it aside. "Please, enter. She would like
to talk to you."

2757
03:19:19,117 --> 03:19:25,976
As you guys all step inside, the interior, a soft,
glowing magical torch lights the room from the

2758
03:19:25,976 --> 03:19:33,047
ceiling. The entire room is a large office or
study. There are books and meticulously kept

2759
03:19:33,047 --> 03:19:39,447
scrolls. At a glance, you can see they break down
various creature types, that talk about indigenous

2760
03:19:39,447 --> 03:19:46,400
bestial creatures, some talk about the anatomy of
mythical and mystical beasts. This is a research

2761
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:53,486
facility for the hunting of any such creature that
would find its way near or in the vicinity of

2762
03:19:53,486 --> 03:19:59,893
Vasselheim. There, waiting for you, not at her
desk, but leaning against it, with her hands also

2763
03:19:59,893 --> 03:20:05,744
at her back, similar to her husband, you see
before you in very finely crafted dark brown and

2764
03:20:05,744 --> 03:20:13,602
black studded leather armor, a small shoulder
cloak fixed and tossed over one shoulder, tousled

2765
03:20:13,602 --> 03:20:20,355
short brown hair, deep purple skin. The second
tiefling you've seen today. This woman stands with

2766
03:20:20,355 --> 03:20:26,832
bright white eyes, no pupil. Her tongue flickers
out of her mouth like a snake a little bit as you

2767
03:20:26,832 --> 03:20:32,329
enter. And she looks about the rest of the party.
"Please. It would be my pleasure to talk with you

2768
03:20:32,329 --> 03:20:37,949
"for a moment about what you have done this day.
Thank you, husband."

2769
03:20:37,949 --> 03:20:40,058
The door slams shut behind him.

2770
03:20:40,058 --> 03:20:42,130
LAURA: You two make an adorable couple.

2771
03:20:42,130 --> 03:20:45,792
SAM: Yeah, he's a peach. Good find.

2772
03:20:45,792 --> 03:20:57,671
MATT: "Welcome, skags. You seem to not be liking
this title. A skag is an affectionate term we use

2773
03:20:57,671 --> 03:21:00,283
"for those who break our rules and will go to
prison,

2774
03:21:00,283 --> 03:21:03,410
"perhaps beneath the Amaranthine Oubliette."

2775
03:21:03,410 --> 03:21:05,688
SAM: Well, as long as it's affectionate.

2776
03:21:05,688 --> 03:21:12,700
LIAM: We understand we've broken the letter of
your law, but perhaps not the spirit of your law,

2777
03:21:12,700 --> 03:21:14,667
which is maybe more important.

2778
03:21:14,667 --> 03:21:19,031
MATT: "Which is why you are here and not currently
being taken for the hall of judgment."

2779
03:21:19,031 --> 03:21:20,474
LIAM: We're very grateful.

2780
03:21:20,474 --> 03:21:24,917
MATT: "Now. My husband said you have interfered
with a contract that has already been enacted."

2781
03:21:24,917 --> 03:21:29,232
SAM: We didn't know we were interfering with it at
the time. We thought we were just doing good, and

2782
03:21:29,232 --> 03:21:30,761
we're here to make right by that.

2783
03:21:30,761 --> 03:21:32,216
LIAM: We're tourists, basically.

2784
03:21:32,216 --> 03:21:37,668
MATT: "Which is also why you are not at the hall
yet. He also said you showed interest in joining

2785
03:21:37,668 --> 03:21:42,785
"our ranks to avoid this prosecution, which I think
is a very smart move." And she walks behind her

2786
03:21:42,785 --> 03:21:48,859
desk and sits down. "Should you be cut out for our
work, that is. You have proven to have slain this

2787
03:21:48,859 --> 03:21:56,330
"hydra with the accompaniment of one of our roving
bands of monster hunters."

2788
03:21:56,330 --> 03:21:58,813
LAURA: They didn't do much, but yes.

2789
03:21:58,813 --> 03:22:05,238
SAM: We're quite capable fighters. Grog here
almost won in his fight the other night.

2790
03:22:05,238 --> 03:22:07,550
Sorry, Grog.

2791
03:22:07,550 --> 03:22:10,786
MATT: "You're the one that nearly felled the
Hammer."

2792
03:22:10,786 --> 03:22:13,092
TRAVIS: I am.

2793
03:22:13,092 --> 03:22:15,000
MARISHA: So you have heard of us.

2794
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,246
MATT: "I've heard of this one."

2795
03:22:17,246 --> 03:22:18,796
SAM: Show her the lip.

2796
03:22:18,796 --> 03:22:20,532
TRAVIS: I kept a keepsake.

2797
03:22:20,532 --> 03:22:27,983
MATT: (laughs) "A fine trophy. Do not show him you
still have that. I don't think it would go over

2798
03:22:27,983 --> 03:22:40,697
"too well. Now. Most applicants for our humble
family make it maybe a month or two before the

2799
03:22:40,697 --> 03:22:47,644
"Vesper Timberlands take them. Those that remain,
well. They prove worthy of our business contracts.

2800
03:22:47,644 --> 03:22:55,707
"You are all on trial by deed, under my claim and
authority. Should you agree and fulfill my

2801
03:22:55,707 --> 03:23:00,505
"request, indeed, you will be absolved of your
infractions against the Slayer's Take and be given

2802
03:23:00,505 --> 03:23:07,914
"membership to our age-old tradition. With
membership comes with access to our lodge, food,

2803
03:23:07,914 --> 03:23:14,817
"room and board, and training facilities. Simple
arms can also be provided. Those that bear our

2804
03:23:14,817 --> 03:23:22,128
"insignia may also get a discount of supplies at
most of Vasselheim's merchants. Most importantly,

2805
03:23:22,128 --> 03:23:31,200
"though, you will then have access to our bounty
contracts. To specify, we don't just hunt beasts

2806
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:37,489
"and creatures. A large part of what we do is
harvest from our marks' requested components.

2807

"Blood, eyes, teeth, organs. We receive orders from
all across Exandria, from as far as even the city

2808
03:23:43,919 --> 03:23:46,228
"Emon, which you apparently hail from."

2809
03:23:46,228 --> 03:23:48,252
LAURA: We have a keep there.

2810
03:23:48,252 --> 03:23:50,387
MATT: "How nice for you."

2811
03:23:50,387 --> 03:23:53,278
SAM: Greyskull.

2812
03:23:53,278 --> 03:23:56,609
MATT: "I will make a note of it." And she reaches
over and grabs a quill and not even looking at the

2813
03:23:56,609 --> 03:23:58,545
paper, just scribbles.

2814
03:23:58,545 --> 03:24:00,476
LIAM: We're friends with the emperor, thank you.

2815
03:24:00,476 --> 03:24:07,379
MATT: "Well, perhaps this emperor and many of
these scholars or seers or mages you've

03:24:07,379 --> 03:24:13,530

or sacrifice of some kind. Many of these require

2818
03:24:19,056 --> 03:24:26,127
"pieces of these creatures. So many contracts are
from very high-paying clients that have better

2819
03:24:26,127 --> 03:24:31,928
"things to do with their time than wander skulking
about the forest, seeking such things as a hydra.

2820
03:24:31,928 --> 03:24:36,798
"There's a lot of money to be gained should you be
up for it. I would ask you to take a contract,

2821
03:24:36,798 --> 03:24:43,082
"complete it, and return. That is all. You would
have three days to do so. Do you accept?"

2822
03:24:43,082 --> 03:24:46,982
SAM: What is involved in signing or binding this
contract?

2823
03:24:46,982 --> 03:24:51,590
MATT: "There is a small ritual that binds you to
the contract. Within this time it must be

2824
03:24:51,590 --> 03:24:56,244
"completed. Should you fail, the contract is
absolved, and your membership is revoked."

2825
03:24:56,244 --> 03:25:00,703
SAM: Oh, it's a trial just to bind the contract?

2826
03:25:00,703 --> 03:25:04,165
MATT: "Your trial is to take the contract and you
have three days to complete it."

2827
03:25:04,165 --> 03:25:07,016
TALIESIN: Is there a payout on this contract?

2828
03:25:07,016 --> 03:25:10,737
MATT: "Oh yes, you will still receive the money
for it, and with membership, from what I have been

2829
03:25:10,737 --> 03:25:14,235
"told by my husband, possibly even share in the
bounty for this hydra

"you helped slay earlier on this day."

2831
03:25:16,110 --> 03:25:18,223
LAURA: That's good, because otherwise they didn't
get any credit, right?

2832
03:25:18,223 --> 03:25:19,368
Because it was like, magically--

2833
03:25:19,368 --> 03:25:25,488
MATT: "Precisely. Also a part of the three-day
contract, with three days before it is null and void."

2834
03:25:25,488 --> 03:25:29,009
LIAM: We've taken out a beholder and a handful of
illithid. We're not really worried about your

2835
03:25:29,009 --> 03:25:31,423
contract. Give us your contract; we'll sign it.

2836
03:25:31,423 --> 03:25:37,171
MATT: She chuckles under her breath. "That is good
to know," she says disbelievingly.

2837
03:25:37,171 --> 03:25:43,617
SAM: There's an insignia that we get? Is it given
to us on some sort of jacket for members only?

2838
03:25:43,617 --> 03:25:46,403
(laughter)

2839
03:25:46,403 --> 03:25:53,176
MATT: She reaches to part of her shoulder
pauldron, lifts it up, and you can see there's a

2840
03:25:53,176 --> 03:25:55,170
brand on the side of her arm.

2841
03:25:55,170 --> 03:25:59,978
SAM: My body's a temple. I don't like that.

2842
03:25:59,978 --> 03:26:03,205
MATT: "Then perhaps you'd like the judgment."

2843
03:26:03,205 --> 03:26:08,429
SAM: The judgment? Oh no, no. Do I have to get
branded?

2844
03:26:08,429 --> 03:26:10,329
MATT: "It does not hurt much."

2845
03:26:10,329 --> 03:26:13,330
SAM: (whimpers) I'm really wimpy.

2846
03:26:13,330 --> 03:26:22,811
MATT: "Gnomes... Three days. Will you accept?"

2847
03:26:22,811 --> 03:26:26,674
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it. We're totally tough.

2848
03:26:26,674 --> 03:26:28,552
SAM: Could you do mine in henna?

2849
03:26:28,552 --> 03:26:30,830
(laughter)

2850
03:26:30,830 --> 03:26:33,641
MATT: "I will take that as an acceptance on your
part, as well."

2851
03:26:33,641 --> 03:26:36,043
SAM: Thank you. Yes. I'm with my group.

2852
03:26:36,043 --> 03:26:41,636
MATT: "Good, good. Now, I trust you work well as a
team, but I am curious how well you work with

2853
03:26:41,636 --> 03:26:50,261
"others. As this is a test, I will be dividing your
band between two contracts."

03:26:50,261 --> 03:26:52,434
LIAM: Ex-squeeze me?

2855
03:26:52,434 --> 03:26:53,923
MATT: "Two teams."

2856
03:26:53,923 --> 03:26:56,262
SAM: Do we get to pick the teams?

2857
03:26:56,262 --> 03:27:07,583
MATT: "You, gnome. Giant. Ranger. Tinkerer. You
will form the first team."

2858
03:27:07,583 --> 03:27:08,966
LAURA: What?

2859
03:27:08,966 --> 03:27:10,541
LIAM: That is bullshit.

2860
03:27:10,541 --> 03:27:19,053
MATT: "You will be taking your contract with a
couple of other hopeful possible members, as well.

2861

Three days to fulfill. Now, cutthroat.
Dragonborn. Vine-speaker.

"You will form the other team."

03:27:29,811 --> 03:27:35,345
LAURA: Does my bear get to come with me?

2864
03:27:35,345 --> 03:27:42,528
MATT: "Your bear is allowed, yes. I shall now look
over our extending contracts to decide your test

"for tomorrow. Go. Return in the morning fed,
armed, and ready to set out. And hopefully get

gone. I have business to do."

LAURA: Wait, no. We work as a pair. Maybe you
don't know that about us.

03:28:01,552 --> 03:28:04,098
MATT: "Oh, then this should prove a very
interesting test."

2869

LIAM: You don't understand, we haven't been apart
in about--

MATT: "Life is hard here in Vasselheim. Deal with
disappointment."

LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry. What was your name again?

2873
03:28:17,092 --> 03:28:24,096
MATT: "I am known as the Huntmaster around these
parts. But should you wish the name in its full,

"Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial."

03:28:29,698 --> 03:28:33,285
TRAVIS: Don't. I grab him and I start walking out
of the room.

2877
03:28:33,285 --> 03:28:34,836
SAM: Vanessa?

2878
03:28:34,836 --> 03:28:39,556
MATT: "Cyndrial. C-Y-N-D-R-I-A-L."

2879
03:28:39,556 --> 03:28:42,039
SAM: I am not going to spell that right.

2880
03:28:42,039 --> 03:28:51,072
MATT: "In the morning: fed, armed, and ready."
Knocks the desk twice. Her husband closes the door

2881
03:28:51,072 --> 03:28:56,132
behind you. You take a deep breath and realize
this will be a very interesting challenge.

2882
03:28:56,132 --> 03:28:59,236
MARISHA: Husband? Do you have a name other than
husband?

2883
03:28:59,236 --> 03:29:02,460
MATT: (laughs) "They call me Mertin, yes."

2884
03:29:02,460 --> 03:29:03,556
MARISHA: Mertin?

2885
03:29:03,556 --> 03:29:05,010
MATT: "Mertin Cyndrial, yes."

2886
03:29:05,010 --> 03:29:09,850
SAM: Mertin Cyndrial... Well, this should be
interesting.

2887
03:29:09,850 --> 03:29:13,318
We'll set off on our journey right away, then.

2888
03:29:13,318 --> 03:29:15,196
TRAVIS: When do we get our brand?

2889
03:29:15,196 --> 03:29:17,604
SAM: After we complete the task.

2890
03:29:17,604 --> 03:29:24,201
MATT: Taps his nose and points. "You catch on
quick. This bodes very well for you, possibly."

2891
03:29:24,201 --> 03:29:26,397
SAM: Have a good three days.

2892
03:29:26,397 --> 03:29:31,160
TRAVIS: Can we stay in the guildhall while we're
waiting?

2893
03:29:31,160 --> 03:29:35,397
MATT: "You are not members. Soon, though. When
one's brand is achieved, as much as you like."

2894
03:29:35,397 --> 03:29:38,497
SAM: All right, Grog. Let's go.

2895
03:29:38,497 --> 03:29:45,551
LAURA: Question, husband. Is there a way to change
those little pairings that she made? Perhaps get

2896
03:29:45,551 --> 03:29:47,868
my brother and I on the same team?

2897
03:29:47,868 --> 03:29:51,417
MATT: (laughs) "Trust me, there's no way to change
my wife's mind. I've tried."

2898
03:29:51,417 --> 03:29:52,859
(laughter)

2899
03:29:52,859 --> 03:29:57,403
MATT: He walks off. And we'll conclude the session
for the evening there.

2900
03:29:57,403 --> 03:29:59,766
LIAM: Eat a bag of dicks.

2901
03:29:59,766 --> 04:05:42,951
