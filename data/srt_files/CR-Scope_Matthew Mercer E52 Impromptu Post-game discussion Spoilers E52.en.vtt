NOTE Paragraph

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:16.144
It's broadcasting. Kind of spontaneous. Oh,
there's some folks hopping in. There we go. Hello!

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:28.939
This was a random thing that happened, so why not.
Hi, guys! Wow, that's a lot of "hey ya"s. Hi! From

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.341
Belgium, too! Nice! Yes, I'm wearing the same
clothes from last night. It's been one of those

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:46.054
days. I think I got to bed at 3:30am-ish.
Anyway... not hungover. We didn't, like, drink

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:51.872
drink. We just had a drink and walked to Bob's Big
Boy and had shakes and ate food you shouldn't eat

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:59.191
at 2:30am and woke up feeling really bleh, but
it's fine.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:04.893
Don't apologize for not seeing the episode. Civil
War is a very strong draw. Not a Strongjaw. Hmm,

00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:12.051
that was kind of fun. Anyway. This is a
spontaneous thing. Doing a bit here before I go

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:20.022
ahead and do more work with Marisha's dad on our
room. Glad you guys liked last night. That was

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:31.265
interesting! I guess part of this brief Periscope
is-- oh I'm sorry you're upset that I cut my hair,

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:36.083
but I have to because it'll just keep getting
longer and it gets ridiculous. It'll grow back,

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:42.963
which is nice and has to go shorter before we can
get longer again. So sorry. The mane will return,

00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:44.634
I'm sure, in time.

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:58.434
Yeah, I guess I'll start with saying that man,
last night was crazy. Major props to the players

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:05.625
for actually pulling out some tactics there in a
circumstance that was pretty rough. I wasn't sure

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:10.345
how that was going to play out and a lot of
circumstances-- a lot of really lucky

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:17.344
circumstances, very good rolls on key moments
really made a difference there. It's interestingly

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:21.627
frustrating at times because when things happen
too perfectly on a televised-- or a live stream

00:02:21.627 --> 00:02:25.302
like that. When certain rolls go so good, it's
almost like, "Man, no one's going to believe

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:31.864
"this," but no one's going to fudge the rolls.
Everyone's policing each other's die rolls and

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:37.647
it's just incredible. It was ridiculous.

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:43.972
I think Grog's arc of coming under the
understanding that his strength comes from his

00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:50.171
friends and not from himself was cool and his
realization and using this to draw Kevdak out into

00:02:50.171 --> 00:03:04.301
the open was pretty neat. I don't want to give too
many spoilers, per se, but between some very key

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:09.785
usage of spells and abilities, some really good
rolls for them, bad rolls at certain key moments

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:14.263
for the enemies, and some really great tactics,
they managed to-- "Why was Fireball halved on

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:25.562
"Kevdak?" Because Kevdak is a Totem of the Bear
barbarian. They actually reduce all damage they

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:30.432
take by half except for psychic, which is nasty
for tank barbarians. Something that Grog does not

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:33.092
have because he's a frenzied berserker.

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:39.748
But anyway, hopefully I'm not giving too much lag
here for you guys and I apologize if you are, but

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:45.007
I'm trying to make sure that doesn't happen. I'm
trying to not to do the up-and-down this time, the

00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:49.255
vertical. I always forget to do that. I feel awful
after the fact. I'm like, "Ugh, why did I do

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:51.708
"that?" It's easier to hold that way.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:04:00.863
Anyway, but there were some really hairy moments
last night, looking back on it, too. If Laura

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:09.114
hadn't gone in there and done what she did with
the broom, Grog would be dead. If she had taken

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:14.454
more damage in advance to that or any of the
attacks had got her, she would have been dead.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:24.353
Pike also very close to death. What the
party didn't know was, if anybody but Grog got the

00:04:24.353 --> 00:04:34.293
killing blow on Kevdak, they wouldn't have stopped
fighting. The combination of having the one that

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:40.536
challenged him deal the final blow, the one they
actually knew, was what gave them pause, that

00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:49.724
moment of the shift. If just a random half-elf
with daggers, or if Vex had shot him with an arrow

00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:58.883
and killed him, it would have been less of a fall
of their ruler to another power that

00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:03.704
they understand and acknowledge. It would have
been just an assassination from a nameless,

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:12.983
faceless creature. They would have just been like,
"He killed Kevdak!" and kept attacking.

00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:19.575
The fact that Grog managed to deal the final blow
really put it in a situation where that battle was

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:25.698
able to come to a rest, which was crazy. And then
the series of social dice. I have seen a little

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:31.283
bit of discussion online because I always like to see
how people's thoughts or opinions on ways that I

00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:39.426
can improve based on feedback and stuff like that.
There are some frustrations some individuals

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:48.709
voiced with with the fact that the bloodthirsty
barbarians didn't just continue to attack and

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:56.524
slaughter. Why would they even stop when their
leader was killed? These aren't mindless

00:05:56.524 --> 00:06:01.965
bloodthirsty barbarians. Some of their actions may
fall into that category at times, but understand,

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:08.697
there are many different facets to a culture
beyond just bloodshed. They have people within

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:12.987
that they try and protect. There's a tenuous
social relationship with the River Maw that

00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:20.076
they've taken in. There's a lot of factors at
stake there and I tried to insinuate that, even

00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:28.595
then, this relationship between Vox Machina and
the now quelled conflict at the moment is still

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:34.575
tenuous. They've lost their leader and, at that
moment, there's only two other individuals that

00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:38.525
have taken any semblance of power and as opposed
to just going into an all-out, "We'll attack

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:42.814
"everyone and everything!" They're just feeling it
out it seems. I don't want to spoil anything

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:48.182
because I'm sure a lot of it will probably play
out in the next episode.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:59.317
Yeah, there's a lot of interesting facets beyond
just them being people that roam and kill stuff.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:04.498
It should be interesting as it plays out. Things
happen for reasons. My narrative is far from

00:07:04.498 --> 00:07:09.196
perfect. I'm having to write on the fly a lot of
the times and doing what I can with what free time

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:16.578
I have. People are more than willing to go ahead
and tear apart elements of it. That's totally

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:23.268
viable, but I try to do the best I can to have
things make sense. It anything's confusing, trust

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:26.618
that there's some reason as to why I did it.
Whether or not you may agree with it, that's

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:29.796
totally fine on you.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:36.238
Anyway, it was a fun episode and I'm proud of
them. The challenge level is still jumping as

00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:44.337
things go and I'm curious to see how they deal
with next week. But yeah, it's crazy. "Did Scanlan

00:07:44.337 --> 00:07:47.744
"get an alignment change?" One act will not give
you an alignment change, depending on your

00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:52.675
alignment. However, continued things towards that
direction will begin to push in that-- nudge in

00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:58.395
that way. We shall see how that aspect will play
into his character's personality going forward,

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:05.574
which should be interesting. Stats for the items
Grog got. I've gotten this question a lot today. I

00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:09.906
was going to see Travis wanted to post them
himself, but I can probably post them up. I know

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:15.865
the Titanstone Knuckles, when attuned, grant a
strength of 24, much like a Belt of Giant

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:22.345
Strength, as well as allowing the user-- I think
it's once per long rest-- or short or long rest. I

00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:28.913
think it's long rest, to be under the effect of
the Enlarge spell. It's not a spell. It's not

00:08:28.913 --> 00:08:35.085
concentration, but it's the effect of an Enlarge,
which is why Kevdak was able to grow, and it gives

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:39.155
them the Siege ability, which means he does double
damage-- whoever has it does double damage against

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:46.735
objects and structures, much like how an earth
elemental's physical attacks do. So that is the

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:54.945
effect of that vestige. It's pretty fun. It's like
an improved Belt of Giant Strength. A couple of

00:08:54.945 --> 00:09:01.943
different fun things. The bloodaxe is not a vestige;
it's not an artifact. It's just a powerful weapon.

00:09:01.943 --> 00:09:10.614
It's a +2 greataxe that deals an extra 1d6
necrotic damage against living creatures and so it

00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:16.944
does not do additional damage to undead and
creatures that aren't considered living. The other

00:09:16.944 --> 00:09:21.574
thing is when it it brings the creature to zero,
it gives the wielder ten temporary hit points. I

00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:28.936
think those are the benefits to the bloodaxe. So
that should be fun on Grog when he gets those on.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:35.225
"Are they fighting one of the dragons?" We'll see.
I have ideas on how I can handle the whole tribe

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:39.094
fighting a dragon. A lot of this is going to
depend on the next episode because it's not like

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:47.094
they all suddenly dove under the banner of Zanror
or Grog. The tribe is two different tribal

00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:53.575
backgrounds that were tenuously under a tyrant's
rule, essentially. Whether or not some agreed with

00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:58.036
him or not, they were all there for the point of
survival and the advancement of their people. Now

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:07.174
that that has been taken, it's a very interesting
social point in that tribe's existence and I think

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:14.626
next episode will definitely bring some of that to
light. So yeah. Should be fun.

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:18.211
Let's see if we can dig in. A few more minutes of
your questions, then I got to jump on some stuff.

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:22.924
I just wanted to hop on and say hi to folks. "Did
I see the Superfight promo cards?" I did! They did

00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:26.775
not tell me they were doing that. It was a cool
surprise. The fact that they have those made is a

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:33.704
weirder part of my reality. I'm still adjusting to
it. It's very strange. "Can't the tribe build an

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:43.813
"ultra anti-dragon thing?" They're not builders,
per se. They don't have a whole lot of time, but

00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:48.003
we will see. "Do I blame Wil Wheaton for my loss?"
No, I don't consider it a loss. It was a fair

00:10:48.003 --> 00:10:53.425
challenge. There were three different moments
where they almost lost party members last night.

00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:58.804
Not like zero hit points, like those barbarians
wouldn't take a party member to zero and then walk

00:10:58.804 --> 00:11:07.004
away. They would continue to cut until there were
just pieces left. So yeah. There were a few kind

00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:15.464
of hairy moments where I wasn't sure. It was quite
an intense evening, definitely.

00:11:17.214 --> 00:11:20.944
"Do I enjoy druids?" I think druids are fantastic!
They're vastly improved in this edition over the

00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:26.905
fourth edition. I've always loved druids. I think
it's a cool character background, cool spell set,

00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:30.234
and has unique variety to play style,
which I like a lot.

00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:35.884
"Do I think the dragon has a chance
against 40-plus barbarians?" Well,

00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:39.144
they're not all barbarians, for one.
I say barbarians because it's just

00:11:39.144 --> 00:11:43.863
an easy term to say, but they all have
different strengths. Some of them are fighters,

00:11:43.863 --> 00:11:53.942
there are handful of druids, a few other
specialties. We shall see. A lot of people versus

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:59.404
breath weapon can be a real fast battle sometimes.
We'll see what they come up with. I'm letting them

00:11:59.404 --> 00:12:05.864
all figure it out. "Am I in Overwatch?" I am! I
voice Jesse McCree, actually, the cowboy character

00:12:05.864 --> 00:12:09.734
in Overwatch. I'm really excited that that game's
about to come out. It's a fun one. As you're

00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:14.933
playing it in beta now or getting it soon, get
used to hearing the horrible phrase of, "It's high

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:19.864
noon." It should be fun. (laughs)

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:24.034
Um, let's see.

00:12:27.084 --> 00:12:29.914
"Advice on getting into voice acting?"
There's this great website that can

00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:34.543
break down any answers I would have for you called
Iwanttobeavoiceactor.com. It's run by Dee Bradley

00:12:34.543 --> 00:12:38.892
Baker. It has one of those comprehensive
breakdowns of exactly the answers to the question

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:44.489
you're asking and way far better than I could. So
check that out, definitely.

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:58.049
"If you would have two of your favorite bosses
fight in the game, who would it be?" Oh, two of

00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:07.719
them fight each other? Oh man. Huh. The Kevdak and
Greenbeard combo is actually a very nasty combo if

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:17.686
they're not held at the same time. Greenbeard's
initial tactic, actually, was either he had a

00:13:17.686 --> 00:13:23.075
number of heals to back up Kevdak during that
entire fight, as well as the ability of-- he was

00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:27.189
going to cast Sunbeam and go earth elemental form.
He would then be an earth elemental shooting beams

00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:32.367
out of his hands in a very Iron Man way. That was
going to be one of his aggressive tactics. Trying

00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:37.435
to line up shots. Yeah, there are a lot of things
that-- Scanlan definitely was the MVP of that

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:43.045
battle. At the very top, if he hadn't they
utilized the Cutting Words to lower the saving

00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:51.392
throw on a Kevdak against the Hold Person, that
would have been a whole different ball game. With

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:59.384
both him and Greenbeard locked down, that pretty
much wrecked things on their side from the get-go.

00:13:59.384 --> 00:14:01.622
It was intense.

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:09.514
"What did I think of Sam's shirt?" It was amazing.
He held onto that the entire day, didn't show that

00:14:09.514 --> 00:14:14.683
to anybody until he unveiled it on the stream and
that was pretty great. "Did Scanlan choose to hold

00:14:14.683 --> 00:14:18.623
"Greenbeard at random?" Possibly. He just said the
the guy with the green beard, and I was like, "All

00:14:18.623 --> 00:14:26.723
"right. Cool." I know people keep asking about why
none of the goliaths were mentioning Grog's beard.

00:14:26.723 --> 00:14:30.280
They haven't been in a situation where it's really
been a concern for theirs yet. I have a feeling

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:40.190
this is going to occur when they have a little
less stressful environments to have discussions.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.280
"Osysa plus mate versus Thordak, who wins?" I
think Thordak would probably have that fight,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:55.187
probably. Yeah, probably. He's a rough one. "Am I
surprised that Grog killed Greenbeard?" I wasn't

00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:59.728
sure which way he was going to go. That was very
much the, "Which path to the herd do you choose at

00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:05.659
"this moment?" You have two individuals that have
some semblance of status within the remnants of

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:11.481
the herd and it seems that only one of these two
you can choose to go with. Both can work towards

00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:16.860
your goals, it just depends on who you trust the
path more and who you think the others can rally

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.743
behind. Zanror's probably going to be a harder
sell to the rest of the tribe than Greenbeard

00:15:20.743 --> 00:15:25.361
would've been just because he'd been established
for so long, but like I said, a lot of that's

00:15:25.361 --> 00:15:27.848
going to play out in the next session, I'm sure.

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:33.420
"Is Allura still in Westruun?" Last they saw via
the scry, she seemed to be radically propelling

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:48.091
her way via the travel spark-- I think it was out of the library
there, the Cobalt Reserve. That's last they saw of

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:54.215
her. We'll see. Am I planning on bringing in a blood
hunter PC? If the story brings them to cross one

00:15:54.235 --> 00:15:57.626
of the orders, possibly. They exist in the world.
They haven't really been in a position where

00:15:57.626 --> 00:16:02.536
they've encountered any yet. They're still very
minimal in presence. Marisha is actually off to a

00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:10.355
shoot right now, so she's not here for this one.
"Would Kevdak's rage have fallen if they would

00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:13.837
have waited around to attack him?" He would have,
actually. If they would have kept him there, his

00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:18.646
rage would have fallen and he would've taken full
damage after that round, but I guess they also

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:24.834
just wanted to try and burn him down as best they
could. They did a lot of damage to him, but that

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:30.276
rage, with the half reduction, kept him going for
a long time.

00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:33.815
"How do I remember so much that's happened
previous games?" I don't know. I still forget a

00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:39.235
lot, I'm sure. I have to go back and remind myself
occasionally, but you live in this world the way I

00:16:39.235 --> 00:16:50.745
have, some of the stuff sticks, I guess. I also
might have a problem. Let's see. I'll do a few

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.223
more of these questions and then I got to get some
work done, but I thought I'd pop in with you guys

00:16:54.223 --> 00:17:08.125
for a minute. Let's see. "Should Grog's rage have
kept up?" Not while he was inside the Raven

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:15.404
Queen's amulet. That put him at a round with no
attack or damage comparatively, so the rage would

00:17:15.404 --> 00:17:19.573
have dropped. Let's see.

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:23.015
"Any surprises in last night's episode?" There
were many surprises. Many tactical surprises by

00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:31.853
the party, many rolls and responses that surprised
me. The fact that they brought Kevdak down so low

00:17:31.853 --> 00:17:36.384
and then went up to 70 points from the Heal and
then they brought him down just back to that 70.

00:17:36.384 --> 00:17:39.645
I'd already calculated, looking at him, he was on
that tail end and that happened to be the final

00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:43.746
blow was Grog. That was a big surprise and really
swung things in their favor. Like I said, if any

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:50.316
other PC had gotten killing blow on Kevdak, the
battle wouldn't have paused. They would have seen

00:17:50.316 --> 00:17:59.342
that as an act of assassination and would have
just kept attacking. It's pretty crazy. Let's see.

00:17:59.342 --> 00:18:05.533
"Been doing the RPGs at Momocon?" I mean, I don't
do a lot of ancillary RPGs because it's hard to

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:10.542
organize and, to be fair, I spend most my time
doing this one, anyway. I can't burn myself out.

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:14.423
I'll be doing panels and stuff probably on gaming,
Critical Role, and things like that. So if you're

00:18:14.423 --> 00:18:18.884
coming to Momocon in Atlanta, I'll have panels
regarding those topics.

00:18:18.884 --> 00:18:23.771
"Why no door involvement?" Look, Tal'Dorei, look,
the doors have had their day and will have them

00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:34.183
again. It can't all be doors. Besides, that would
be unfair, TPK them instantly. Oh cool, you got

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:40.253
Loot Crate because of us? Awesome! Yeah, it was
really cool of Loot Crate to reach out. We've had

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:43.124
Loot Crate for a long time ourself. We have a few
friends that worked with them in the past and

00:18:43.124 --> 00:18:48.193
they're a really nice company. I mean, thanks to
you guys we're getting to the point now with the

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:53.483
show that we can have sponsors, which is cool
because that helps us out. It means that we can,

00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:58.103
for me especially, means that I can spend more
time focusing on the show because it makes a

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:04.853
little more on the side for me. Which is good and
it means that we can provide a lot of special

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:12.163
discounts for our fans and we can help build
the brand into something that we never expected it

00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:18.574
would be. We're still holding on and seeing where
this whole thing goes. I'm blown away that the

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:30.210
show is what it is, and that you guys are what you
are. So life's weird right now. It's good; it's weird.

00:19:30.214 --> 00:19:35.379
What about Matt Colville? I saw someone mention
his name there. Matt Colville is an amazing person

00:19:35.379 --> 00:19:40.879
and once again, if you haven't seen his videos on
his tips for running games and world building,

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:47.347
they're fantastic and very well thought-out and
thorough. He's an amazing writer and a really good

00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:52.790
friend and, because time and such has prevented me
from being able to do as many or as in-depth as

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.630
the GM Tips episodes as I've been wanting to-- and
I hope to do some more pretty soon-- he's been

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.768
helping fill that gap and do a far better job than
I could have, so definitely check those out.

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:07.020
"Have Matt Colville on the show?" There's been
talk. We have a long list of people that want to

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.569
be on the show and I'm being particular and
careful. I want to make sure that they're people

00:20:10.569 --> 00:20:14.638
that aren't going on just for self-promotion. I
want to make sure the people that are genuinely

00:20:14.638 --> 00:20:21.538
interested or passionate about either learning to
play or have played before and want to get on and

00:20:21.538 --> 00:20:27.608
do fall somewhat in an entertainment realm that we
do. Colville would be phenomenal on. He's

00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:31.700
definitely in consideration on my list, so don't
worry.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.319
"Critical Role stuff in Loot Crate?" That largely
depends on the how well the sponsorship goes.

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:40.208
That's part of the discussion. If it does well and
enough of the audience takes to it and they

00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:47.562
find that there's a good overlap and that Venn
diagram of Critters and Loot Craters, I guess,

00:20:47.571 --> 00:20:52.954
I'm calling them now, coined it. Then there has
been talk maybe doing specific Critical Role stuff

00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:56.573
down the line. That's what I'm really excited
about with this whole sponsorship is the

00:20:56.573 --> 00:21:03.545
opportunities to bring more of this world I made
up to physical form. It's been the weirdest

00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:10.954
experience in the world. I can't even. "What do I
think of the Savage World system?" It's great. I

00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:15.244
like it a lot, especially Deadlands. I'll keep
pushing that one because it's one of my favorite

00:21:15.244 --> 00:21:21.899
RPG systems. "Is my dad a bard?" Totally, and
actually he made a bard the one game I tried to DM

00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:28.660
for my parents. He made a bard, named him
something Fender because he's my dad, musician.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.492
"Pop Funko Mercer." Someone sent me one, a custom
one, at Critmas and it's on my desk and it's amazing.

00:21:36.781 --> 00:21:40.892
Let's see, what other questions here?

00:21:48.262 --> 00:21:54.332
"Any update on the fanzine?" Yeah, the fanzine's
interesting. We were wanting to plan something

00:21:54.332 --> 00:21:57.972
We were working on a way that we could bring
the community and actually produce something

00:21:57.972 --> 00:22:07.371
official through Critical Role that would include
the community artists and hopefully do an occasional

00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:12.533
recurring thing like that where you're bringing
together. Partially into planning and the fanzine

00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:19.854
announcement happened. We were like, "Oh how do we
roll all this together?" So we love the idea, but

00:22:19.854 --> 00:22:24.903
we figured it might be cooler if we could go ahead
and work with them on a professional level to put

00:22:24.903 --> 00:22:31.652
something together, make it look really nice and
put it on like the shop sale, and actually make

00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:38.843
some money for the artists who put all this time
into it as well and have it be official. I

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:44.104
probably shouldn't even been talking about this,
but whatever NDA. (shushes) Surprises. We have

00:22:44.104 --> 00:22:47.963
ideas, we have thoughts, and we're hoping to do
something really cool with you guys, with the

00:22:47.963 --> 00:22:51.644
wonderful art community that's come out of this,
so hopefully in the near future, we'll be able to

00:22:51.644 --> 00:23:02.560
talk more about it. You didn't hear anything here.
(shushes)

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.611
Let's see. Have a little lag here. I'm not getting
any messages. Here, take three more questions than

00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:15.633
I got to run. All right. "Opinion on psionics?" I
have a weird history with psionics. Psionics have

00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:23.983
always been historically broken in a lot of ways
in older editions. I felt a lot of psychic powers,

00:23:23.983 --> 00:23:31.402
the way they were designed in the older, like
second edition, days were very out of genre for

00:23:31.402 --> 00:23:36.504
me, so I had a hard time enjoying them. They've
gotten better over years and I'm waiting to see

00:23:36.504 --> 00:23:42.903
what they do in fifth edition releases coming up.
It's a cool facet. I haven't quite found an

00:23:42.903 --> 00:23:50.392
implementation that I'm really happy with yet. So
we'll see as things happen.

00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:56.422
I will send regards to Dagon. I'm sure she'll
appreciate it by going (clicking). She's really

00:23:56.422 --> 00:24:02.300
cute when she's really relaxed and she makes kissy
sounds. We'll wake up and she'll crawl in bed with

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.551
us and we'll go (kissy sounds) and she'll turn to
us and go (kissy sounds). We'll do that back and

00:24:06.551 --> 00:24:10.911
forth for like five minutes. It's the cutest
thing. Birds are awesome. "Thoughts on 3D-printed

00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:19.162
"minis?" Oh man. I would love that. Maybe one day
I'll get a 3D-printer and I'll put them out. I've

00:24:19.162 --> 00:24:23.063
seen some really cool stuff happen. I'm all about
like the idea 3D-printed terrain, as well. I think a

00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:31.294
few Critters who sent me some amazing things of
that. Based on just toying with and playing and

00:24:31.334 --> 00:24:39.402
expanding on the Dwarven Forge stuff. Last night
was like my grand magnum opus, a cityscape. I was

00:24:39.402 --> 00:24:42.403
really happy how that turned out. I hope it came
across well on camera for you guys, wasn't too

00:24:42.403 --> 00:24:48.842
confusing, but it could help elevate. Yeah, I'm on
this like terrain kick right now. Like, "How can I

00:24:48.842 --> 00:24:57.101
"do this?" Let's see.

00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:59.765
Okay. "Kevdak took half the fire damage, was that
supposed to happen?" Yes, I answered that earlier,

00:24:59.765 --> 00:25:06.033
but I'll say it again. Kevdak was not a berserker
barbarian. He is a Totem of the Bear barbarian.

00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:09.484
One of their abilities is when they're raging,
they halve all damage except for psychic. That's

00:25:09.484 --> 00:25:15.004
actually their benefit. They're more of a tanky
barbarian, to clarify for you guys.

00:25:15.004 --> 00:25:18.873
"Tips to encourage players to roleplay a bit
more?" If you're running the game, just engage

00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:24.704
them as an NPC. Look them in the eyes and talk to
them as the NPC would, and if they begin to

00:25:24.704 --> 00:25:30.061
describe what they're doing, we ask them, "Well,
how do you say it? Go ahead and say it. Talk to me

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:34.822
"about it as the character." Or even temporarily
implement the rule well, "Whatever you say, you

00:25:34.822 --> 00:25:39.613
"say in character." If they're really not
comfortable with that, then don't push them. You

00:25:39.613 --> 00:25:43.283
want to make sure people are playing on the level
that they're comfortable for, but if you can nudge

00:25:43.283 --> 00:25:47.065
them a little bit out of the comfort zone, they
may discover that they enjoy it more. It may take

00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:53.013
a little more work on your side as the DM to do
so, but yeah.

00:25:53.013 --> 00:25:58.163
"Any tips to calm an overconfident party?" Throw
something in their way they can't beat and teach

00:25:58.163 --> 00:26:08.540
them that sometimes you have to run. You have to
run. (laughs) There're many ways to do it and if you

00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:11.869
look online, there's some cool options for that.
I'm going to take one more question and I got to

00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:22.880
run and get some work done. Let's see, look
through here. "Do I use index cards to plan out my

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:30.070
"campaign?" I don't use index cards. I print out
spreadsheets that I make in Microsoft Excel and

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:36.799
cut them into smaller blocks that I then tape to
paper. So I use standard-sized pages, but I-- I

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:41.228
should remember to take a page behind the screen
one of these days. I'm always such in the zone

00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:43.648
when I'm set up and getting ready to go in the
game because I have a lot of things I have to

00:26:43.648 --> 00:26:48.169
prepare my brain and load up all the mental
programs of what I'm about to run that I forget

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:55.670
to. But I'll see if I can do that some point in
the near future.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:01.259
"What do I think of 14-year-olds like you playing
D&D?" That's when I started, so I think it's cool.

00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:07.610
Be aware, some environments, especially in those
ages, kids can be cruel, but be prepared that. Be

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:15.349
sure of who you are, have fun, and if you're not
having fun with one group, maybe find another one.

00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:20.099
"Are we okay to send character sheets for you to
use as an NPC?" To put in perspective, I'd say

00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:28.369
just in the past Critmas alone, I received about
35 to 40 different player characters people were

00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:36.020
sending me to use in the campaign. I'll reiterate,
I-- situation of favoritism, so I'm going to try

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.158
to implement more possible contests in which we
can incorporate NPCs for the winner and stuff like

00:27:42.158 --> 00:27:46.899
that. We did that once before and it worked out
well, so I'm hoping to do stuff like that in the

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:55.077
future. But I can't ensure that because it is a
weird slippery slope. But yeah.

00:27:55.077 --> 00:28:01.497
All right, I know I said one more before and then
I did three more. Sorry. "Do I feel physically--"

00:28:01.497 --> 00:28:05.760
this will be the last one. "Do I feel physically
drained at the end of a session?" Yes, it's a very

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:16.491
mentally and physically taxing experience running
that game. It's intense, so I usually sleep well

00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:20.090
the night after. Don't sleep well the night
before. Sleep well the night after. I try not to

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.338
schedule something too early Friday morning, but
inevitably it happens. Like this morning I had a

00:28:24.338 --> 00:28:28.068
9:00am session and I didn't get to bed until about
about 3:00, so I got about four and a half hours

00:28:28.068 --> 00:28:33.449
of sleep last night total. So that was fun.
Anyway, guys, I've got to get going. Much love. I

00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:37.269
hope you all have a wonderful day. Thank you for
listening to me ramble for a little while. Looking

00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:42.178
forward to the next session and is it Thursday
yet? All right guys, take care.
