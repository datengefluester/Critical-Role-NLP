1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,086
LIAM: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role!

2
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:10,472
(cheering)

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:14,592
LIAM: Critical Role-ish. Where a bunch of us
nerdy-ass voice actors will be sitting around,

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:21,309
rolling dice and playing-- yes, playing, Dungeons
and Dragons. Please do not adjust your computer

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:29,207
monitors. Your TVs. I'm not Matt Mercer. Can't you
tell? We lost our illustrious DM.

6
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,557
SAM and LAURA: Not forever.

7
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:37,392
LIAM: He's gone for all the next seven days to
Australia with our badass druid, Marisha Ray.

8
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:45,054
They're both down in Haven Expo in Mackay,
Australia. Anyway, we don't have them; they're not

9
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:50,281
here, so instead we're going to have a little shit
storm of our own. And we'll get back to the Vox

10
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:56,273
Machina tale next week. Anyway, I wasn't going to
do anything. This feels so weird.

11
00:00:56,273 --> 00:01:00,199
TRAVIS: You're doing great! You're killing it!

12
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,914
LIAM: The fact that I am not sitting next to
Laura, who is like, if I'm Linus, she's my blue

13
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:07,017
blanket for this game.

14
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:09,404
LAURA: If you were sitting next to me, though,
you'd be getting smacked in the head over and over

15
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,047
again right now.

16
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,728
LIAM: Has the camera panned over to her yet?

17
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,177
LAURA: Don't do it, Travis!

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:22,554
LIAM: Well, anyway, I wasn't going to do this at
all because I didn't have any time, but then a

19
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:28,637
directing job of two days went poof, which happens
once in a while. I had two days to cobble

20
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:33,315
together some stupid bullshit to do with my
friends. And we're going to do it, we're going to

21
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:38,816
see how it goes. I'm really looking forward to it.
But before we get to all that, we got a ton of

22
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,425
announcements. So why don't we jump into that?
The first one that I see here is that the Joe Mad

23
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:51,081
poster on the Geek and Sundry store online. We
only have one day left on the signed posters until

24
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,863
tomorrow at 1:00. It is really hard to concentrate
with that.

25
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,313
LAURA: Do you want me to stop while you're
doing announcements?

26
00:01:55,313 --> 00:02:00,302
LIAM: Nope, I want to get used to it. Until 1:00
tomorrow you can still get the signed posters.

27
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,586
TRAVIS: One day left!

28
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,670
LAURA: One day!

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,394
SAM: Go online now!

30
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,681
TRAVIS: Isn't there some musical you were in that
said something or other about one day more?

31
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:12,692
SAM: (singing) One day left! To get a Joe Mad
poster.

32
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:18,717
LIAM: But if you can't do that, we also have one
more week to get the unsigned. So it'll be there

33
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:22,697
for a full week, and then they're gone. I don't
know when. Forever.

34
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:29,076
LAURA: We might have a small stock here for
giveaways or something, but I doubt it.

35
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:31,350
TRAVIS: We're going to lock ourselves in a room to
sign them.

36
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,616
SAM: We're going to burn the unsold ones.

37
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:37,605
LIAM: Just to stress, though, in person they are
gorgeous. They are gorgeous to look at.

38
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,496
SAM: Just like us.

39
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:43,423
LIAM: Sammy.

40
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:51,100
SAM: Okay. Thank you to all of the fans, the Geek
&amp; Sundry fans, because together we raised

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:03:02,290
$84,512.57 this weekend to support Muscular
Dystrophy Association. You guys brought it. You

42
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:10,263
kept bringing it. As promised, because we are oath
keepers, we raised more than $75,000, therefore

43
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:15,972
the Deadlands one-shot with some of the Critical
Rollers will be posted online--

44
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,247
LAURA: It already is online.

45
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:26,413
SAM: --is live already. Live, on
geekandsundry.com. Oh, there's also still time to

46
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:32,018
donate to the cause. There's a link in the chat,
just click on it and keep donating. Let's get it

47
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,324
over $100,000.

48
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:38,309
LIAM: There's still that t-shirt, too, the blue
Critical Role t-shirt that all the proceeds go to

49
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:39,967
the charity. They're still for sale.

50
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,526
LAURA: I don't know.

51
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,248
LIAM: I was told they are.

52
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:44,517
LAURA: I think they're still up.

53
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,486
LIAM: You can go take a peeky-poo and find out.

54
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,716
TRAVIS: You'd have to stop hula-hooping for five
seconds!

55
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:52,405
LIAM: She's still going. Quick little
announcement: we can tell you now that we are

56
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:57,436
definitely going to be with Geek and Sundry at San
Diego Comic Con. There'll be more details coming

57
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:01,244
out next week, but we're going to be doing a ton
of stuff there. We're looking forward to it. We're

58
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:05,982
going to be at PetCo Park again, which means if
you can't get tickets to Comic Con, you can come

59
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:12,287
see us over at the stadium. Now, some really big
news, we'll cut to Travis! Breaking news!

60
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:18,785
TRAVIS: Liam, we have lost our collective god damn
minds and we are actually taking this show out of

61
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:28,830
the studio for the first time ever! Critical Role
is going to be doing Critical Role Live! July

62
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,940
14th, West Hollywood. Save it! At the Landmark
Theaters on Pico, we are going to be doing

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,261
Critical Role Live, same time, 7:00pm Pacific
Standard Time, but we are going to do it in front

64
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:45,299
of a live audience. There tickets that are going
to be up at 6:30pm, which it's already past.

65
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,928
SAM: Oh, wait, tickets are up now!

66
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:48,508
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: They're up!

67
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:52,192
SAM: Buy tickets to see us live. To touch our
bodies. Live.

68
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:58,379
TRAVIS: The link is in the chat, and the things
you need to know: The doors will open at six, the

69
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,641
show will start at seven, we will be done by ten.
We always say that, but that never happens. And

70
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:08,001
the people that will be there, there will be a 30
minute Q and A, in-person, live afterwards.

71
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,623
LAURA: Not on the stream.

72
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:14,928
TRAVIS: That's right. There's a general admission
amount of tickets. I think there's only 167

73
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:20,142
tickets because it's our first time trying this
and there are 62 VIP seats that are super close.

74
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:25,424
There'll also be a meet and greet involved
afterwards, but it'll be like a super luxurious

75
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,783
Critical Role package. And you'll get super sweet
swanky stuff.

76
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:33,261
TALIESIN: Mercer gives an amazing foot massage. It's
amazing.

77
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,186
SAM: Critical Role Live! One night only!

78
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:40,042
TRAVIS: Hopefully, one of many to come, but there
has to be a first step.

79
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:43,597
SAM: We should talk about this off the stream, but
we should have an opening act, a warm-up guy!

80
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:47,437
Right? We should get a stand-up or something.
Maybe Hardwick will come over.

81
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,348
(laughter)

82
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,519
LIAM: That's complicated now.

83
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,708
TRAVIS: Yes, it will still be on the stream. It's
still being streamed, but live.

84
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,668
TALIESIN: Madness.

85
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,287
TRAVIS: That's it. Quick signing, meet and greet
for VIPs only, that's all I got. There will be

86
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,204
more details as we get closer, but July 14th.
Tickets will go fast.

87
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:16,589
SAM: For every ten minutes that Laura does that, I
will donate one dollar to the Muscular Dystrophy

88
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,541
Association.

89
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,933
LAURA: Aw, come on, how long have I already been
doing it?! Is it retroactive? I can't do it the

90
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,955
whole time. I got to sit down, you guys.

91
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:29,564
LIAM: I've got two more quick announcements. One,
just to help Marisha out, there's a new Signal

92
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:37,030
Boost out with America Young doing her first
boost. America Young is totally badass, good

93
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,342
person, funny as hell on the show. I've seen a
little bit, took a look. And then, T, one of our

94
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,154
Ts, Taliesin, you have a little--

95
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,657
TALIESIN: Yeah, against all sanity, I will be at
Anime Expo on Friday and Saturday--

96
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:51,689
TRAVIS: God be with you.

97
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,627
TALIESIN: God be with me. Oh lord. At the Unified
Pictures booth talking about the new Vampire

98
00:06:56,627 --> 00:07:00,233
Hunter D comic, which I'm doing some stuff with
and helping out with. It's going to be awesome.

99
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,868
We're going to have a giant hand on display. It's
madness. And they are already prepared for me to

100
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:10,687
just sit there and talk about DND and Pathfinder,
and they're already prepared and totally cool

101
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:16,017
with that. So come on by and just talk. Makes them
look good.

102
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,933
SAM: Are there more announcements?

103
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,910
LIAM: Not unless you've got something.

104
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,331
SAM: Liam's going to run the show!

105
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,044
LAURA: I'm going to stop hula-hooping so I can
play.

106
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,999
TRAVIS: You got to keep going until the credits
start.

107
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:26,980
LAURA: Okay.

108
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,411
LIAM: So we'll take a quick little mini break, and
when we come back, we'll let the bullshit sale

109
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,729
begin!

110
00:07:32,729 --> 00:09:07,049
[dramatic music]

111
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:15,648
LIAM: So when last we left Vox Machina. No, I'm
just fucking with you. Okay. We're really doing

112
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,894
this? We are really doing this!

113
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:20,529
SAM: Is this the music you want playing?

114
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,815
LIAM: Kill the music! I'm drunk with power. Kill
it!

115
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,101
SAM: Great, it worked.

116
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:32,441
LIAM: It worked. There we go. Power with a
three-second delay! Well, look. It is another

117
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:38,300
hot-ass day in Los Angeles, guys. Three days into
the latest heat wave with temperatures in the

118
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:49,243
valley hitting 116, 117. Luckily-- whoa! Wow, a
zephyr! A wind just blew by! Luckily, for the four

119
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,429
of you: Travis.

120
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,538
TRAVIS: Yes.

121
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,724
LIAM: Laura.

122
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,201
LAURA: Yeah!

123
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,301
LIAM: Taliesin.

124
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,537
TALIESIN: Yes!

125
00:09:57,537 --> 00:09:58,461
LIAM: And Sam.

126
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:00,087
SAM: Was not expecting this to be white.

127
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,565
(laughter)

128
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:06,782
LIAM: You guys live the life of voice actors in
Los Angeles, so you get to beat the heat. You

129
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:12,047
spend most of your days in supremely air
conditioned recording studios. You hide away in

130
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:18,355
your dark little hidey holes. And today, you're
double lucky because not only do you get to hide

131
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:23,667
from the heat, you get to work with three of your
bestest friends in the whole wide world. That's

132
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,363
right: the four of you guys have been working for
the last six to nine months, really, on the latest

133
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:34,932
game by Phalanx Studios. You're working on the
third in the Felguard series. You've been doing

134
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,602
performance capture for months.

135
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,582
LAURA: Ugh, so hot in this mocap suit!

136
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:43,030
SAM: You know what? It's worth it for number
three. Felguard III!

137
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,118
(laughter)

138
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:48,565
LIAM: But you know, most of the performance
capture is behind you. You've done all the

139
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,387
principal stuff, you probably returned for
pickups, but now we're moving into the voice over

140
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:59,118
leg of the journey. And today, you're kicking off
your first day of serious VO on the job. You're

141
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:03,633
going to have several days this week, and you are
headed to good old Warner Brothers Studios.

142
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,787
LAURA: Are we talking battle chatter?

143
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:11,657
LIAM: No, no, no, it's traversal, it's the
connective tissue between cut scenes.

144
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:14,635
TRAVIS: Are we hoping to see the water tower when
we arrive?

145
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:20,022
LIAM: How can you not see the water tower when you
arrive at the WB? It's on the lot!

146
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:26,251
SAM: By the way, this is a setting that everyone
watching can identify with. You're on the Warner

147
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,197
Brothers lot.

148
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:29,191
TALIESIN: I want to run to my car and get my ID
badge.

149
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:33,309
LIAM: Have you guys have seen Animaniacs? You know
all you need to know. You've all had busy

150
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:38,929
mornings. Travis, you had a home workout. You
worked out and did whatever strong people do. I've

151
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:43,476
read about it. I don't know, myself, but I
know you do something to look like that. You did a

152
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:48,903
bunch of that. You jumped in the pool, cooled off,
listened to showtunes all the way there. Laura,

153
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:54,543
unfortunately, you've been working all day! You
had a 9:00 to 1:00! You've got to rush over for a

154
00:11:54,543 --> 00:12:00,341
2:00 to 6:00! You work two sessions a day!
Seriously, is this game over yet? Taliesin! You've

155
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:04,061
been at home writing all day on a totally
unrelated project.

156
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,416
TALIESIN: Oh, why would I do that?

157
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:10,918
LIAM: Well, because it's anime, and that goes deep
with you. Somebody's got to adapt that shit! But

158
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:16,067
you get to work on this fucking AAA game, Felguard
III. You're going to go do some VO. You're heading

159
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:22,945
over now. Sam is rushing over, obviously, from one
of the, like, 37 animated series, I've lost track

160
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:29,680
by now. You're barely going to make it on time.
Got a little wrinkle, though? Well, it's a heat

161
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,734
wave, right? And your air conditioning broke. And
your neighbors had just gone on vacation and given

162
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:39,879
you their dog, Bixby. He's a pug. He's staying at
your house, but you can't leave Bixby in the house

163
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:45,272
when it's that hot. You took him to work, which is
fine when you're directing. I don't know how it

164
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:47,285
would go in the booth.

165
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,165
SAM: Is he a quiet dog?

166
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:50,559
LIAM: He's generally pretty quiet.

167
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,011
SAM: All right, I'll take him and we'll hope that
the director's cool with it.

168
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:58,926
LIAM: He's fucking adorable. Anyway, you all roll
up, you come through the gate, you park under that

169
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:02,380
iconic water tower. Sam, ten minutes after
everybody else.

170
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,442
(laughter)

171
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,145
LIAM: You hit that air conditioning. It feels so
good to get out of there. (boosh) You cool down.

172
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,019
Hey, guess who the voice over director is!

173
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,132
TRAVIS: Who?

174
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:17,077
LIAM: Liam O'Brien. Your old friend, Liam O'Brien,
that lovable idiot. Here he is. He's going to

175
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:20,191
direct you! He's taken over for the voice over leg
of Felguard III!

176
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,669
LAURA: This is really, really weird!

177
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:30,212
LIAM: Yes, it is. You're seeing some people for
the first time in a while, other than Liam, who you

178
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:39,535
see pretty regularly. You go downstairs.
Obviously, Pierce O'Toole is there. Iconic red

179
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:47,087
woolen Zissou cap on, big beard and his tie. Love
him. Emma stops in for a minute, but briefly.

180
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,243
SAM: Can you do an Emma impression?

181
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,976
LIAM: I think I'm going to steer away from that.

182
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:54,809
(laughter)

183
00:13:54,809 --> 00:14:01,289
LIAM: And your engineer today is Allen. The devs
are there, too. Three of the devs from Phalanx are

184
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,657
there. They were all there on the set; you know
them really well. Jenna the writer's there. She

185
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:11,914
comes in and says, "Oh my god, Travis! I played
Ragnarok! You were such a beast in that game, and

186
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:19,183
"a different kind of beast than from ours! I mean,
it's so stupid, I work in games, but I hear you

187
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:22,707
"guys sometimes, I'm like, god, I didn't even know it
was him! I didn't know it was you!"

188
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:26,441
TRAVIS: That's our ultimate goal, so it really
makes me happy to hear that we were able to

189
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:30,387
confuse the ear. One performance to the next.
Thanks.

190
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:35,060
LIAM: And the director, Garrett, who was on set as
the director, comes over to you and is like,

191
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,963
"Dude, you're not going to believe the scenes are
coming back. I mean, it's at 80%, it's not fully

192
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,512
"rendered and everything."

193
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:43,806
LAURA: How's it looking?

194
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,513
LIAM: "The sword work you did looks fucking--
you're a monster."

195
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:50,524
LAURA: That's great, because I barely trained, and
I was floundering on the set.

196
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,902
LIAM: "How's that bruise?"

197
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:56,472
LAURA: Oh, no, it's totally fine. It's barely
seeable. I totally won't sue the company or

198
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,605
anything.

199
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,707
LIAM: "So just, so you know, when we get in there
today, I know that Liam's taken over, but we

200
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,532
"talked about that edge you have? Hold onto that
edge."

201
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:05,249
LAURA: Yeah, I won't pay attention to what he's
saying. Don't worry.

202
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:14,649
LIAM: "All right." Also, the audio lead is there,
and he's eyeing the dog. His name is Gus. "And I

203
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:20,277
"just want to make-- I mean, is it normal to bring
dogs to recording sessions?"

204
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:26,629
SAM: I'm sorry about this, Gus. I'm in a pickle,
and my friend left me this dog, and I don't want

205
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,402
the dog to die, obviously.

206
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:32,100
LIAM: Liam chimes and says: "Well, is he quiet? Or
is he going to--?"

207
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,416
SAM: From what I've seen he's a pretty quiet dog.
We've really grown quite close over the last

208
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,271
few--

209
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,631
LIAM: "Is he more likely to bark if he's apart
from you? Because we also don't want him barking

210
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,257
"in here if he's away from you--"

211
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:46,085
SAM: You know what, if I could take him in the
booth with me, then Gus, if you're allergic you

212
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,241
don't have to worry about it, it'll be near me, and
that would be great.

213
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,805
LIAM: Well, Liam turns to the rest of the guys and
says, "Well, we'll just give it a minute, and if

214
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:57,278
"it's a problem, we'll figure it out, but if you
say that's he's good-- what's his name?"

215
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,867
SAM: His name is Bixby.

216
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,869
LIAM: "Hey, Bixby." (cooing noises)

217
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:03,930
LAURA: Don't give him chocolate, Liam.

218
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,115
LIAM: "Okay."

219
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,777
(laughter)

220
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:15,585
LIAM: "Why would I give a dog chocolate? That's a
stupid idea." Allen takes you in. Are you going to

221
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:17,418
be sitting or standing?

222
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,192
LAURA: I'm going to be standing.

223
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:24,228
LIAM: Okay, so he walks person to person and
adjusts all your microphones. Pierce pops in and

224
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:26,984
goes, "Guys, can I get you any coffee or tea?"

225
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,330
SAM: I'll take a tea.

226
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,587
TRAVIS: Yeah, Throat Coat with a little bit of
honey?

227
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:32,522
LAURA: Are you making a Starbucks run?

228
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,966
LIAM: "We can do that."

229
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:36,638
LAURA: If you're doing a Starbucks run, I would
love a Starbucks, please.

230
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:40,524
LIAM: "Let me get it down. Let me take up this
game of Critical Role with taking down a Starbucks run."

231
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:47,629
TRAVIS: Allen, do you mind actually if I sit? It
was a boss leg-day yesterday, and I'm smashed. Is

232
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:48,732
that cool?

233
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,363
LIAM: "We're getting picky. No, it's all right."

234
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,799
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, it keeps me from
wandering.

235
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,016
LIAM: "It's fine."

236
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,216
LAURA: I'm freaking out right now! What is
happening?!

237
00:16:55,216 --> 00:17:02,975
LIAM: You guys all get set up, and after a while,
Liam pops in on his own, and he's smiling, but he

238
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,281
looks a little tense.

239
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:05,807
SAM: That's normal.

240
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:09,425
(laughter)

241
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:15,021
LIAM: He goes, "Okay, so we have a ton of shit to
get through. We have enough time, but--"

242
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:17,138
SAM: Did they not budget correctly for this?

243
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:21,062
LIAM: "We're good, we just can't screw around too
much. Not too much. So it's going to be great.

244
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:25,048
"Should be great. Okay. All right. I'll be with you
guys in one minute." And he heads back out, he

245
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:28,404
goes in. You guys are now vacuum-sealed in, and
they're talking--

246
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,799
LAURA: Can they hear us? Are the mics live? Can
they hear us?

247
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,102
TALIESIN: I was going to say, it's Warner
Brothers. They never give me headphones in Warner

248
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,135
Brothers.

249
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:38,189
LIAM: They can hear you, at the moment, but you
can't hear anything coming out of there.

250
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,910
TRAVIS: Just get the puppet show so far.

251
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,399
SAM: How's that bruise feel, for real?

252
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,404
LAURA: It fucking sucks! I couldn't move my arm
for like three days.

253
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:48,728
SAM: You should've trained, is what you should've
done.

254
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:51,940
LAURA: Don't touch it! Don't touch it. Don't.

255
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,966
LIAM: "Okay, guys, I guess we'll just dive into
it. So the first page of the script is right there

256
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,224
"on the top."

257
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,573
LAURA: Oh, I see what we're doing now.

258
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:03,901
TRAVIS: The one with our name on it, right?

259
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,071
LIAM: Yeah.

260
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,216
SAM: Just that one?

261
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:11,135
LIAM: "Yeah, just the one. So this is the first.
We've got like 50 of these to get through. This is

262
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:21,524
"us leaving Oathbreaker Keep, right after that huge
fight, Laura, between your character, right, and

263
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,736
"the Quartermaster? You and the Quartermaster
fought, and now you're leaving in a huff?"

264
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,933
LAURA: Yeah.

265
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:28,229
LIAM: "Okay, so the last thing that happens in
that scene, I just want to remind you, is Sam,

266
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:34,658
"Tantalus gets cheeky with her and sends her off, so
Laura, remember that you're coming off of that

267
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:38,528
"line from the very end when you shove him out of
the way and walk toward the gate."

268
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:44,043
LAURA: I am so embarrassed. I forgot my glasses at
the session. That's okay, I'll be able to see.

269
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:47,471
It's totally fine. Yeah, I can see it. I'll just
hold it close.

270
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:50,288
LIAM: "Okay, so is everybody ready to get
started?"

271
00:18:50,288 --> 00:19:03,751
(vocal warm-up sounds)

272
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:07,875
LIAM: "Okay." Allen calls out the take number and
says, "Take one." And you guys are left into

273
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,201
silence.

274
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:15,139
LAURA: Enough. The felguard had their chance. If
we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own.

275
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:20,252
SAM: (sighs) Make hay while the sun shines, I
suppose. And you have some sort of plan?

276
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:25,977
TRAVIS: I say we knock on the Vargarth's door and
feed them their broken promises.

277
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:28,380
TALIESIN: Direct. I like it.

278
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,096
LAURA: Quiet, we're not alone.

279
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,502
TRAVIS: Is that how you're going to do it?

280
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:36,128
LAURA: Did I say scourge wrong? Scourge?

281
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:43,027
LIAM: "That was my first point. It's scourge. You
said scorge. Well, we'll do one more, do me a

282
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:46,638
"favor, this is like a walk-and-talk, so flatten it
out. Yeah, Taliesin?"

283
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,280
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I--

284
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,040
LIAM: "Flatten it all, I think flatten it all out
a bit, keep it on the move. And Sam, I think your

285
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,683
"guy is a little miffed from getting shoved right
before in the cutscene that leads into this, so I

286
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:01,455
"want to carry some of that, you know--"

287
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,552
SAM: (shushes) Bixby! Okay, got it.

288
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:06,384
LIAM: "Are we cool? Okay, all right, we'll just go
right back into one more."

289
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,527
TRAVIS: Anything for me?

290
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:14,293
LIAM: "No, just more of the same-- just overall,
everybody can flatten it out, a little bit. Yes.

291
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:18,722
"Travis was the best. Here we go again."

292
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:21,185
LAURA: Did Allen say the-- I'm sorry, is it on?

293
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,809
TALIESIN: We're rolling, that was the beep.

294
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:23,885
LAURA: I didn't hear the take number.

295
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,766
LIAM: "I'm sorry, I spaced out. This is take two."

296
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:31,747
LAURA: Enough. The felguard had their chance. If
we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own.

297
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:39,074
SAM: Make hay-- Pickup. Make-- (sighs) Pickup.
Make hay while the-- Pickup. Make hay while the

298
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:44,706
sun shines, I suppose, and you have some sort of--
Pickup. Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose.

299
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:48,198
And you have some sort of plan?

300
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:57,761
LIAM: Liam cuts in on the mic, and says, "It's
really good, guys." The whole room-- the devs,

301
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:03,107
Pierce, everybody is busting up laughing behind
the glass window behind him. "You know, let's just

302
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:04,977
"get a fresh one, Sam."

303
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:06,346
SAM: Sorry. I was distracted.

304
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:14,121
LIAM: "We're off to a great start, guys, great
start. All right, here we go. This'll be take three."

305
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:20,738
LAURA: Enough. The felguard had their chance. If
we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own.

306
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:25,037
SAM: Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose. And
you have some sort of plan?

307
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:30,174
TRAVIS: I say we knock on the Vargarth's door, and
feed them their broken promises.

308
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,709
TALIESIN: Direct. I like it.

309
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,501
LAURA: Quiet. We're not alone.

310
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:42,811
LIAM: "That was perfect. That was--" And then,
just as Liam says that, he turns to the guys

311
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,642
behind him, and they go back and forth. He takes
his finger off. You're in silence for a second.

312
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:49,284
TALIESIN: This is going to be ten minutes.

313
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:51,555
SAM: They're rewriting something. They always
rewrite something.

314
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:53,272
TALIESIN: They're recasting something or rewriting
something.

315
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,211
TRAVIS: If you'd pay attention to it--

316
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,713
LAURA: Can you hear us?

317
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,685
TRAVIS: No.

318
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,471
SAM: I could probably do my line a little better.

319
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:10,045
LIAM: "Okay. It was totally awesome. Let's just
try one more thing, where I would say that I do

320
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:15,335
"want it all flattened out, but just the very first
line, really explode at Sam."

321
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,993
LAURA: Until the exclamation point, or the whole
line?

322
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:25,625
LIAM: "Through 'chance', I would say. Just round on
him, and then you know, furrowed brow, heading in."

323
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,907
LAURA: (groans) Got it.

324
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:28,178
TRAVIS: And just better overall.

325
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:29,572
LAURA: Thank you, Travis.

326
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:30,818
TALIESIN: More acting.

327
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,140
LAURA: Thank you, Taliesin.

328
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,948
LIAM: "Everybody's great. Let's just do one more,
and we'll have this. (rumbling) What was that cue?

329
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:39,855
"Pierce? What was that?"

330
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,379
SAM: Feedback, or something.

331
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:44,644
LIAM: "Fuck it. All right. Last take! And this is
take four--"

332
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:50,822
LAURA: (burps) Enough! The felguard had their
chance. If we're to end this scourge, we do it on

333
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:51,937
our own.

334
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:56,704
SAM: (slurred) Make hay while the sun shines, I
suppose. And you have some sort of plan?

335
00:22:56,704 --> 00:23:03,093
TRAVIS: I say we knock on the Vargarth's door and
feed them their broken promises!

336
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:05,340
TALIESIN: Direct. I like it.

337
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,547
LAURA: (sarcastically) Quiet. We're not alone.

338
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:11,209
TRAVIS: Did you feel that, too?

339
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:13,466
SAM: We made different choices.

340
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:17,951
LIAM: "Okay, I-- that was a good option, I think,
probably-- hold on."

341
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:21,346
TRAVIS: See, you make them fight amongst
themselves.

342
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,853
LIAM: "Guys, just give me a second."

343
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,930
SAM: (whispers) Take one was fine.

344
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,209
LAURA: I'm serious, you should take the collar off of
the dog. I can hear it.

345
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:32,575
TRAVIS: You know, sometimes you got to give them
the really bad-- (laughs)

346
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:35,561
TALIESIN: I'm having some weird stomach stuff, too
I don't know if they're picking that up.

347
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:39,390
TRAVIS: Take another drink, you sounded a little
smacky the last take.

348
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:47,082
LIAM: While you guys are all yammering, you notice
that Liam is gesticulating a little bit more. It's

349
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,902
lasting a while.

350
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,933
TRAVIS: Maybe a little agitated?

351
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:56,210
LIAM: I mean, you've all worked with Liam, you
know how, when he turns to the people behind him

352
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,379
and he talks, and then he comes back and gives you
a little, like-- just for you? You know how he

353
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:09,487
does that? This is the other half of that, where
he's trying to get some point across. Anyway. Time

354
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:10,648
is passing.

355
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,869
LAURA: And we're just sitting here?

356
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,519
TRAVIS: It's been a hot second.

357
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,910
LIAM: And he turns around. "Just give me one
minute. We're just trying to figure out shit on

358
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,391
"our end, okay? We'll be right with you."

359
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,842
LAURA: Okay. Should we take a--

360
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:24,834
TALIESIN: Just do one more, louder. That's just
usually what they want, just one more louder.

361
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:27,461
SAM: You know, Pierce is fucking taking forever
with this tea, also.

362
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:33,874
LAURA: Oh, still no coffee. I sent him to
Starbucks. Sorry.

363
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,936
SAM: I don't think he owns a car.

364
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:37,891
LAURA: No, they have a Starbucks on the lot.

365
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:40,263
TALIESIN: Does he have the golf cart?

366
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:42,148
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think they have little electric
golf carts.

367
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,469
LAURA: Those things are awesome.

368
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:47,115
LIAM: So Laura, while everybody's talking, you
just space out, like you're looking at your iPhone

369
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:48,281
for a little bit.

370
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:54,484
LAURA: You're right. You know what? What was I
thinking? This is not what would happen.

371
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:58,987
LIAM: But after 30 seconds of that, and they have
been talking for a long time, you're just spacing

372
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:04,766
out, and you stare over at your water bottle 
next of you there on the little standy thing. And

373
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:15,622
you see, strangely, a little ripple in the water.
And before you can even decide what that means,

374
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:18,720
everyone feels a little (vibration) under the
ground--

375
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,340
LAURA: Oh my god. Was that an earthquake?

376
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:28,037
LIAM: And then the entire room rocks to the side--
you guys all sway to one side, you see everybody

377
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:35,923
react behind the glass, and out of nowhere, what
can only be described as a pulse or force-- almost

378
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:42,092
like electromagnetic pulse through your actual
brain, you wonder, is this what radiation feels

379
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:51,082
like? (electric humming) The sensation is like
your thoughts turning 360 around in your head, and

380
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:57,191
you're caught in it, and then you're out. You guys
look at each other, and the floor has buckled up,

381
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:02,662
and the ceiling has buckled down, and worse than
that, you look to the glass, and there is

382
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:12,115
pandemonium on the other side of it. Liam is
floating two feet in the air, alien abduction

383
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:17,139
style, floating in space. You can't hear a thing.
You can't hear shit. You see everyone around him

384
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:22,761
freaking out, and then suddenly his body rips in
half--

385
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:26,713
(shouting over each other)

386
00:26:26,713 --> 00:26:28,498
LAURA: What are you doing?!

387
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:34,613
LIAM: Not blood and guts, but globules of matter,
almost like beads of mercury floating in the air

388
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:42,660
between, and the two halves hover, and both
halves of Liam's face look horrified and frozen in

389
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,331
space, and then, the next thing that happens is
each of those halves, you see from that gooey

390
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:56,793
miasma coming out of their body, a shriveled arm
and leg go (poof). And they drop, and then the

391
00:26:56,793 --> 00:27:01,670
back wall behind everyone, that you guys have
looked at so many times, has darkened, and starts

392
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:10,637
to look wet and purple, and expands and bulges
almost like the taut flesh of a caterpillar, and

393
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:17,506
suddenly the wall sucks inward (sucking noise) and
you're looking past-- through, really-- Liam's two

394
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:23,898
halves at a dark, winding-- I would almost call it
a tunnel, except it looks more like intestines,

395
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:29,751
curving in and away, and the devs are looking
around in horror-- by the way, Liam was wearing

396
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,970
that yellow shirt of his, with the lion, with the
glasses--

397
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,759
TRAVIS: Are we in ADR6? Can I grab the electric
guitar--

398
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,176
LIAM: This is ADR5.

399
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,891
TRAVIS: Shit! No guitar!

400
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:47,010
LIAM: And that's when you see four more Liams in
yellow shirts with the lion with the glasses,

401
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:52,987
crawling up the sides of that purple tunnel, not
like a human, but like a little--

402
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:54,109
TRAVIS: Nope!

403
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,843
LAURA: This is not okay, Liam.

404
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:02,685
LIAM: They're crawling all over the devs. They're
yanking them into that tunnel. The two Liam halves

405
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:06,185
that were floating there have dropped to the
ground, and both of them--

406
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,317
LAURA: I want to stealth!

407
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:10,650
LIAM: You're an actor!

408
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,759
TRAVIS: I run to the booth door and I bar the
door.

409
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,816
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the mic and help to
bar it.

410
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:17,288
TRAVIS: There's a lock, isn't there?!

411
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:20,256
LIAM: Well, the good news is that the floor
buckled up and the ceiling buckled down, so the

412
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:25,185
door is jammed in place. There's also a splinter
up through the glass window--

413
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:27,313
LAURA: Can Liam see us through the window?

414
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:33,050
LIAM: Everyone's really busy right now, and the
two that dropped to the ground turn towards

415
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,178
Pierce, and Pierce backs up.

416
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:37,373
SAM: He was back with the Starbucks?

417
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:42,106
LIAM: No, he'd just walked in 30 seconds ago with
a full tray of coffee.

418
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:45,730
TRAVIS: Pierce! Use the coffee! Scald them!

419
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,216
LIAM: He can't hear you! He drops it, he runs back
out the door. the two that had been floating there

420
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:55,022
drop to the ground and scuttle out the door, up
the stairs, out the door after him. They're gone,

421
00:28:55,022 --> 00:29:02,945
and the devs are gone. And Allen is being dragged,
bloody and beaten, back into that passage.

422
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:05,745
TRAVIS: Are his white New Balances covered with
gore?

423
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,112
LIAM: They were.

424
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,771
TRAVIS: No! Oh no!

425
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:16,690
LIAM: The lights in the room you're in flicker
(electric flickering). The lights go out.

426
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,308
SAM: We whip out our fucking iPhones, and we start
making phone calls.

427
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:22,461
TALIESIN: I'm Periscoping all this shit!

428
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,383
TRAVIS: Do we have any signal?

429
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,353
LIAM: You have no signal.

430
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:27,779
(groaning)

431
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,225
TRAVIS: What about Wi-Fi?

432
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:35,862
LIAM: No Wi-Fi. There is light coming out of them,
and there's light coming out of what you think was

433
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:39,405
Liam's Mac. In the room.

434
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:40,821
SAM: Did we sign our contracts, yet?

435
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,652
(laughter)

436
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:45,984
TALIESIN: This is the most concise direction we've
had.

437
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,412
TRAVIS: Okay!

438
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,007
SAM: What do we do?

439
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:51,301
TRAVIS: Taliesin, go see if anything is out there
still.

440
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:53,404
LAURA: You can't send Taliesin out there.

441
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:54,304
TRAVIS: Why?

442
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,141
LAURA: Baby.

443
00:29:55,141 --> 00:30:00,160
TALIESIN: If I can get to my car, I think I have a
kit for this, but other than that I'm not really

444
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,245
sure what to do.

445
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,082
TRAVIS: That does not surprise me about you one
bit.

446
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,055
SAM: Wait, are there currently Liams in the
control room?

447
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:13,072
LIAM: No, and in fact, that intestinal tunnel
going back has swelled shut and sealed-- it's

448
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,550
still dripping.

449
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:20,218
TALIESIN: Okay. Is the rail system for the
television broken?

450
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,753
LIAM: The what system?

451
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,057
TALIESIN: Well, you know the giant TV in ADR5 is
on a big swinging arm.

452
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,416
LIAM: No, it's still all intact.

453
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:32,254
TALIESIN: So we can break the glass if we just
give this thing a big, heavy push.

454
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:34,438
LAURA: Can we try to get the door? I mean, is the
door completely--

455
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,434
LIAM: You can certainly have at it.

456
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,943
SAM: (laughs) Trademark it.

457
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:41,165
SAM and TALIESIN: You can certainly have at it!

458
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,920
TALIESIN: New shirt.

459
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:50,889
LAURA: Travis, try to lift the ceiling up and I'll
try to pull the door out. Just push the ceiling

460
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,147
boards up some so I can try to open the door.

461
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,355
TRAVIS: All right, I try and push--

462
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,534
SAM: I'm going to assist.

463
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,461
TRAVIS: -- the ceiling boards

464
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,595
TALIESIN: I'm working on the TV.

465
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,891
LIAM: At this point, you all can take out the last
sheets.

466
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,727
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh no.

467
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:07,548
LAURA: Oh, it's our players! Oh jeez!

468
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:09,621
LIAM: What are the character names?

469
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:11,919
SAM: My character name is is Sam.

470
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,303
TRAVIS: Mine's-- with a silent V?

471
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:20,027
LIAM: Yeah, Trais.

472
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:24,044
SAM: Okay, this is good.

473
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:27,732
TRAVIS: My intelligence sucks, you motherfucker!

474
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:32,655
(laughter)

475
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,159
LIAM: Strength is really good!

476
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,475
TALIESIN: These stats are a compliment, man, dear
god.

477
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,733
LIAM: Hey, I rolled them.

478
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,283
TALIESIN: Did you roll them?!

479
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:42,277
LIAM: Well, I assigned them where I thought would
be helpful for what you're playing and who you

480
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,763
are.

481
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:47,063
LAURA: Look how strong you are, though! You're so
strong, baby!

482
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:49,654
LIAM: I couldn't give you 18s in everything,
guys.

483
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,265
TRAVIS: No, that's true.

484
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,679
LIAM: So what did you want to do?

485
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,405
TRAVIS: We're going to try and push the ceiling
part of the door up-- the jamb, see if we can

486
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:58,072
relieve some pressure on the door.

487
00:31:58,072 --> 00:31:59,883
LAURA: And then I'm going to try to pull the door
open.

488
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:02,173
TRAVIS: Sam's helping me, so we're bringing over
the chairs to stand on--

489
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:05,240
LIAM: All right, well, you make a strength check
with advantage.

490
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:16,098
TRAVIS: With advantage. Ooh, baby, first roll! Oh
god. That was terrible. 12.

491
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,641
SAM: With advantage?

492
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:20,704
LIAM: It's not budging.

493
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:25,016
LAURA: Help him, Sam! Push up on the ceiling, too.
I'm weak.

494
00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:27,534
LIAM: Well, you guys are together, right?

495
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:30,317
LAURA: I was trying to pull the door while he was
pushing the ceiling up.

496
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:33,156
TALIESIN: Legit, how crumpled does this look?

497
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:36,805
SAM: We can bust through the window.

498
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:41,216
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the TV, and I'm going
to take a running throw with the TV.

499
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,961
SAM: Bixby, get over here!

500
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,012
LAURA: Oh gosh, Bixby.

501
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:49,001
LIAM: All right, you make a strength check.

502
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,797
TALIESIN: Okay. Oh boy. I'm using a different die,
too.

503
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:54,723
SAM: That's a good roll!

504
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,319
TALIESIN: That is. That's 18.

505
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:03,496
LIAM: Glass shatters all over Liam's computer, all
on the floor. It's gone.

506
00:33:03,496 --> 00:33:06,080
LAURA: It's the Valomilk one.

507
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,673
TRAVIS: We are in Armageddon! What are you doing?

508
00:33:08,673 --> 00:33:10,667
SAM: We're trying weird candy, too.

509
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:15,472
LIAM: That wall? That moving wall? Gives a little
(sucking sound).

510
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:17,172
TALIESIN: Out!

511
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:20,046
SAM: Wait! Should we stealth? Let's stealth out of
here.

512
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,770
LAURA: Quietly! It's busted.

513
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,690
TRAVIS: Is the door to the studio open to the
hallway?

514
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,112
LIAM: Yeah, it's cracked open.

515
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:29,382
LAURA: Yeah, we want to try to be as quiet as
possible.

516
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,367
LIAM: You know what to do. Make a stealth check,
motherfucker.

517
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,902
LAURA: Oh jeez.

518
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:35,422
SAM: Do I have to roll for Bixby?

519
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,070
LIAM: Yes.

520
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,019
LAURA: Oh, this is good. What, what! 24!

521
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,089
TRAVIS: 17.

522
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:47,865
TALIESIN: 24? 13.

523
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:50,659
SAM: I got a five. Bixby got a three.

524
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,521
(laughter)

525
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:53,609
TRAVIS: Dead.

526
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:57,670
LIAM: That's accurate. All right, so you guys
creep up that little set of stairs out of ADR5.

527
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,143
TALIESIN: Have you really drawn a map?!

528
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:12,309
LIAM: Okay. So here's ADR5. You just smashed the
glass right here, and you've come up the stairs,

529
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:21,904
and as you creep up, quiet as you can, Bixby
farts. You wait, you pause for a second-- nothing

530
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:28,459
happens. You look: it's dark out here. There is a
flicker of light coming from down in this

531
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:34,599
direction. Everyone's got cellphone flashlights
on? Okay. You swivel over here to the left, and

532
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,502
this hallway, like tin foil, is crumpled in.

533
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,656
SAM: Impassable?

534
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:44,497
LAURA: It's okay. We need to go the other
direction, anyway.

535
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:49,201
TALIESIN: I say run and duck into the kitchen, and
see-- and just run and duck into the kitchen.

536
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:53,113
LIAM: Okay, well, sorry, so there's a door here,
you're passing it-- there is, as you come out the

537
00:34:53,113 --> 00:35:02,249
door, you all hear a metallic sound (ringing).
It's hard to tell what it is, but something is

538
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:07,447
spilling out of the kitchen, like six feet high,
spilling out of the kitchen.

539
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:11,985
LAURA: We can't see what it is? Can we put our
flashlights on?

540
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:22,279
LIAM: Sure. It's beautiful. It's gold-looking.
It's coins. And other stuff, spilling on a

541
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:27,308
diagonal slant, down out of the kitchen into the
hallway, right in front of that frigging little

542
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,476
sitting area. It's a pile of stuff!

543
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:31,831
TALIESIN: No.

544
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,982
TRAVIS: What do you mean, no? The gold?

545
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:37,754
TALIESIN: Why would they put it here? This is the
worst place to put money.

546
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:42,089
SAM: Maybe there's a vault down here. There's a
lot of old vaults down here.

547
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:52,557
LIAM: While you guys are arguing, a gigantic,
red-- like a gigantic alligator's claw, I guess,

548
00:35:52,557 --> 00:36:01,438
comes down along that slant and rakes in as much
of it as it can and pulls gold. And as it does so,

549
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:07,693
a little goblet spills out, you see a sword? Spill
out on the ground?

550
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:08,839
TRAVIS: Mine!

551
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:15,204
LIAM: There's a mess of stuff in there, and maybe
a third less gold there now?

552
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:17,600
LAURA: Are there any other weapons?

553
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,773
TRAVIS: Just to protect us, I'm going to go get
the sword.

554
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:23,142
SAM: You can't go over there. What if that thing
grabs you?

555
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,755
LAURA: Just walk around to the other side. We have
to get out that hallway, anyway!

556
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:27,963
TALIESIN: I'm going to go through my bag and see
if I have anything.

557
00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:29,784
LAURA: That's the hallway we've got to go!

558
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,414
SAM: Should we create a diversion?

559
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:32,551
LIAM: (barks)

560
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,885
LAURA: Oh jeez. Just go!

561
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,802
TRAVIS: Can I kill the dog with the sword?

562
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:36,976
SAM and LAURA: No!

563
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,642
TALIESIN: Grab the sword and let's run out!

564
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:41,398
TRAVIS: I'm going to go and try and grab the sword
and come back to them real fast.

565
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:45,263
LIAM: Okay, as you do so, you see a sword. You
also see a dagger, you also see the edge of a bow

566
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:50,161
poking out of it. You also see a silverish-colored
looking stick or rod.

567
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,916
TRAVIS: Just grab all of them and run back to
them.

568
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,832
LIAM: You grab a bunch of stuff? Make a dexterity
check.

569
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:58,314
LAURA: So you don't cut yourself with all the
weapons?

570
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,155
TRAVIS: Eight?

571
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:07,439
LIAM: Eight. You do manage to slice into your hand
on something. You're holding an armful of sharp

572
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:15,427
stuff. But you come and you dump it out. A sword?
A maniac sword. It's gigantic. A couple daggers

573
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:20,715
fall to the ground as well, you had a bow hanging
over your neck, and there's a weird silver-colored

574
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:28,611
rod there that has tentacles etched into it in a
spiral down around it?

575
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:33,780
TALIESIN: It's a caduceus! I know what this is.
This is a thing. It's the snakey thing. Hold on,

576
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,678
this might-- I'm going to grab that.

577
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:40,714
TRAVIS: Unless there are any objections, I would
like the giant maniac sword.

578
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:43,153
SAM: What else do we have? A bow and daggers?

579
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,519
LAURA: I'm good with the daggers, I guess?

580
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:53,072
LIAM: A giant red hand comes down and goes claws
in. Now there's half of that left. Give or take.

581
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:56,054
SAM: I'll take the bow. Are there any arrows?

582
00:37:56,054 --> 00:38:03,300
LIAM: Not here in this pile, but you do see a
quiver, like something out of the goddamned Lion,

583
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,829
the Witch, and the Wardrobe poking out of that
pile of gold.

584
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:10,386
LAURA: Let's all run past it. Grab it on the way
through, and get down the hallway.

585
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:13,208
TRAVIS: A handful of gold when we run by!

586
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:18,366
TALIESIN: I'm going to run quickly into the men's
bathroom that's right behind that little hallway.

587
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,885
LIAM: Okay. Can I ask you a question, though. Did
you pick up that rod?

588
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:21,982
TALIESIN: Oh, I did pick up that rod.

589
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:30,168
LIAM: The moment you do, you feel a headache
spring out the side of your head. It's

590
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:32,594
migraine-esque in level.

591
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:36,304
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. If you're changing, let me know.
I'll just cut you open now.

592
00:38:36,304 --> 00:38:38,646
LIAM: And you feel like you had a quick acid
trip.

593
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:41,768
LAURA: Are you going to split apart like Liam
did?

594
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:45,405
TRAVIS: That's it. I'm holding the tip of the sword
towards Taliesin.

595
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:50,076
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to the bathroom and try
and find some fucking Advil underneath the

596
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:53,819
god damn-- I'm going to find first aid and pills.

597
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:59,633
LIAM: You storm in. There's no lights in here
other than the phone you're holding. Right? Okay,

598
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:02,770
you start searching around? Make an investigation
check.

599
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,357
TALIESIN: Okay.

600
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:06,983
TRAVIS: I think he doesn't handle the apocalypse
well.

601
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:08,801
TALIESIN: 20! No, 21!

602
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:13,982
LIAM: There is one of those giant, bulk
Costco-sized jars of Advil.

603
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:16,264
(laughter)

604
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,916
TALIESIN: I pour my pockets full with them and
take four.

605
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:23,414
LIAM: Okay. Still have a headache at the moment,
but you're not splitting in half.

606
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:26,504
TRAVIS: 800 milligrams?

607
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,373
TALIESIN: I get nervous, man.

608
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:29,938
LIAM: (growling)

609
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:34,736
TRAVIS: Can I go knock at the door? Taliesin, if
you're cool, we got to go, otherwise--

610
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:39,392
TALIESIN: I open the door, and I'm taking some of
these, in case, and--

611
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:41,642
SAM: How are we going to get past the big claw
thing?

612
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:43,095
LAURA: Just run around it.

613
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:44,444
SAM: What if it grabs one of us?

614
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,113
TRAVIS: Do you see the size of it? It won't
notice.

615
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:51,602
LAURA: Seriously, though, did that look like
Thordak to you? That's how I imagined Thordak

616
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:52,662
looking.

617
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:54,018
TALIESIN: I hadn't really thought about it.

618
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,490
TRAVIS: There are no such thing as dragons, okay?

619
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:02,826
LIAM: You see the snout of something shove into
the hallway, just barely. Giant nostrils (snorts).

620
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,792
LAURA: We have to get the fuck out!

621
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:08,985
TALIESIN: Worst-case scenario, we feed it the dog
if it tries to go for us.

622
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,170
LIAM: It's gone.

623
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,033
LAURA: Run! Go! Grab the quivers!

624
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:15,607
TRAVIS: As we dart past, I snake down and grab a
couple of coins.

625
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:21,009
LIAM: Make a dex-- coins? And are you guys-- both
of you make a dexterity check.

626
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:22,801
LAURA: I'm running for my life.

627
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:25,071
SAM: I got a five.

628
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:26,683
LAURA: Jesus, Travis.

629
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:27,707
TRAVIS: Six.

630
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:33,369
LIAM: You're both good. That's all you needed.
It's sitting out on the floor. You're running like

631
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,478
fuck.

632
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:38,615
TRAVIS: Yes! I will sell you and be rich in the
end in the post-apocalyptic world!

633
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:48,114
LIAM: All right, so you sprint past here. You see
this door is open. What's that music, man?! It's

634
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:52,744
just darkened room. You do see some brownies on
the table as you run by. You come around the

635
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:59,248
corner and-- you know how I told you there was
some light before? This door is slightly ajar and

636
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:04,052
there is a pale, goldish-colored light coming out
of it. This door is open as well.

637
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:07,662
LAURA: Can I creep up and peek in the door with
the light coming out of it?

638
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:09,289
LIAM: You want to peek in?

639
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:14,001
LAURA: I just want to make sure there's nothing
going to jump out.

640
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,634
LIAM: Okay, you creep up.

641
00:41:15,634 --> 00:41:17,629
LAURA: I turn off my cell phone light.

642
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:22,072
LIAM: I think it's the server room there with all
those machines in it.

643
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:24,177
LAURA: Oh, so it's where the light's coming from?

644
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,725
TRAVIS: What do you see?

645
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:33,316
LIAM: You see a pale glow basking over all of
these terminals in this room. And you hear a

646
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:54,598
voice, faint. You know it. It's Ashley's voice.
You hear, "Find-- me-- waiting-- cafeteria."

647
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:58,235
SAM: Ashley's here?!

648
00:41:58,235 --> 00:42:00,242
LIAM: The room goes dark.

649
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:02,656
LAURA: What did she say?! What did I hear?

650
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:05,876
LIAM: You heard find, waiting.

651
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:09,313
LAURA: Cafeteria? I think Ashley's here!

652
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:11,242
SAM: She's not working on this game!

653
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:12,510
TRAVIS: Go get her!

654
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:18,759
LAURA: I thought of something else. How could she
be here?! How could I have heard her voice coming

655
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,219
from the server room?

656
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:23,487
SAM: Maybe they were editing something from a
previous game.

657
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,810
TRAVIS: That's it. This is where they do Blindspot
post.

658
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,751
LIAM: You hear a loud crunching sound, not a
growl. As you guys are at the corner, you guys are

659
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:36,084
here. And you look over your shoulder and you see
this end of the tunnel go (crunch)--

660
00:42:36,084 --> 00:42:38,201
TALIESIN: Upstairs!

661
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:41,243
SAM: We run towards the light.

662
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:44,962
LIAM: You run towards the light. Well, this was
the light. It's gone. Now you're just iPhones. As

663
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:53,381
you run past this open door, nonsensically you
look and you hear a (creaking). And there is a

664
00:42:53,381 --> 00:43:04,525
porthole of a boat scraping by the door and water
sloshing in the door. You see an 'I-C' pass by. Cold

665
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:07,302
water spills around your feet, icy cold water.

666
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,608
TRAVIS: Just in the room?

667
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:15,398
LIAM: Against the door. You're seeing this go by
the door on the inside.

668
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:17,329
LAURA: What the hell is happening?!

669
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:19,016
SAM: This is hell.

670
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,638
LIAM: The hall behind you (crunching).

671
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:24,799
TRAVIS: If I open the door, will it flood the
hallway?

672
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,341
SAM and TALIESIN: I don't know.

673
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:29,005
LAURA: Let's open the door to go up the stairs and
then--

674
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,128
TRAVIS: We'll do that.

675
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:37,960
LIAM: Okay. You guys bolt up the lobby. It's not
dark in the lobby. There's sunlight. You run up to

676
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,723
that, you go up and around and you turn left and
you see that glass door that we've gone through

677
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:42,922
1,000 times.

678
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:44,455
LAURA: Out to the parking lot!

679
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,593
LIAM: You want to go out there?

680
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:46,525
LAURA: Yeah!

681
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:53,045
LIAM: You're going out there. Taliesin grabs the
door (deep humming). You feel your thoughts

682
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:59,020
twisting around in your head again. You feel that
feeling of you can only imagine high-powered

683
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,730
radiation, something--

684
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,494
LAURA: Oh jeez. Taliesin, get away from the door!

685
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:07,616
LIAM: You can't move. Nobody can move. You're held
in place. The moment his hand touched the door

686
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:16,520
(deep humming). You're standing on the steps, and you're
looking at the parking lot. Sort of. The door in

687
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:29,606
your hand is rusted and old, and you're looking at
the five-story-tall form of a gray, green, legged

688
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:35,845
squid-like monstrosity. Everyone roll a d20.

689
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:38,471
SAM: For what? What are we rolling?

690
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:41,138
TRAVIS: 15.

691
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:44,618
LAURA: Oh no! Advantage? Five.

692
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:46,052
TALIESIN: 19.

693
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:47,314
SAM: Eight.

694
00:44:47,314 --> 00:45:03,167
LIAM: All of you, except for Taliesin, is frozen
in terror at the mind-numbing presence of what can

695
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:12,139
only be a harbinger of the end of the world, you
think. It is massive. It could crush you if it

696
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:13,637
sneezed on you.

697
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:18,072
TALIESIN: Has it noticed us?

698
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:20,619
LIAM: Yes, it has.

699
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:26,832
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently start pulling people
back towards the door.

700
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:36,880
LIAM: Its head brays at the sky and a groan comes
out of it like the sound of a whale magnified for

701
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:44,491
10,000 miles. If anyone is still alive in
Calabasas, they are hearing an all-terrifying

702
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:54,052
groan as it looks down at you. The pulse in your
head goes (throbs). The Advil is not working, and

703
00:45:54,052 --> 00:46:03,822
you see it flex five stories. This thing is coming
out of what used to be Olive Avenue. There is a

704
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:10,935
massive chasm outside of the Warner Brothers lot,
and this thing looks as if it were a Chinese

705
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:16,701
dragon. It looks like it is continuing down to
that crevice and coming up to here. And it is

706
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:25,216
looking at you and flexing. And you see all
over its body, little ridges, little nubs start to

707
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:35,694
bulge and protrude almost like little blackheads
pushing out. And then (deep humming) you all feel

708
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:41,943
that same pulse moving through your head as you're
frozen in place and Taliesin just agog, one of

709
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:51,897
them goes (explosion). Fires out like a little
missile and starts to fall, and the beast is gone,

710
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:57,332
and you're looking at a different sight. The
building that it had crushed is there again, but

711
00:46:57,332 --> 00:47:05,900
covered in vegetation. Everything is covered in
centuries of vegetation. There is a massive pond

712
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,916
here in the parking lot. And you watch,
dumbstruck, the fear releasing as a thing

713
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:21,750
(splashing) splashes into the pond. You look out
to the left at the gate, and there is still a

714
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,801
giant chasm where Olive used to be. The nearest
land you can see is by the gas station, or what

715
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:37,356
was the gas station three blocks away. The tower,
you can see one leg sticking up out of the

716
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:40,271
foliage. You are in dense--

717
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:44,097
LAURA: Are we still frozen in fear?

718
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:48,505
LIAM: It's just released. And there's a thing in
water going (slithering).

719
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:51,444
LAURA: I don't think we should try to go outside
any more, guys.

720
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:53,115
TRAVIS: I think we're outside.

721
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:55,207
LAURA: We're straight-up outside?

722
00:47:55,207 --> 00:47:59,789
LIAM: There's no ceiling over you any more.
There's no second floor on the building. All

723
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:07,204
that's left is one of the doors, part of a wall.
You're basically outdoors.

724
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:09,418
TRAVIS: Okay. We traveled time, somehow.

725
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:14,973
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take two more Advil.

726
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:17,478
SAM: You're going to OD on Advil.

727
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,325
TALIESIN: I'm gonna offer them around.

728
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:22,499
TRAVIS: I take a mouthful, like maybe seven of
them.

729
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,799
TALIESIN: Is there a golf cart covered in
vegetation? Are there any remnants of a golf

730
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:27,681
cart?

731
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:29,628
LAURA: Anything we could use to get around?

732
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:35,011
LIAM: Where you're standing, you have no idea. All
you see is green. The only thing you see that

733
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:40,685
isn't green right now is part of the door next to
you and part of the water tower. One of its legs

734
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,826
is sticking up like a bony finger.

735
00:48:42,826 --> 00:48:45,660
LAURA: I wonder if we could climb the water tower
legs to see around.

736
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,696
SAM: At summer camp.

737
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:48,057
TRAVIS: You did archery at summer camp?

738
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:48,985
SAM: Yeah!

739
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:50,828
TRAVIS: How many arrows do you have?

740
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:52,065
SAM: How many arrows do I have?

741
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:53,224
LIAM: Do you want to count them?

742
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:54,174
SAM: Yeah.

743
00:48:54,174 --> 00:48:56,150
LIAM: There are exactly 25 arrows.

744
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,639
SAM: Ooh! There's 25 arrows!

745
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:01,235
TRAVIS: See if you remembered any of that stuff
and take a shot at that horrible-looking thing

746
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:03,849
that's moving through the water!

747
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:09,011
LAURA: I don't think one arrow that is poorly shot
is going to kill whatever that thing is. Sorry, but

748
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,328
camp? Come on.

749
00:49:10,328 --> 00:49:12,957
TRAVIS: He could be amazing. This could be Legolas
we're talking about.

750
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:14,987
SAM: I'm pretty bad.

751
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:17,779
TALIESIN: We can take turns. If he's terrible, we
can just take turns.

752
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:20,089
TRAVIS: If he misses, we throw him in the water.

753
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,268
TALIESIN: Throw the dog in the water!

754
00:49:22,268 --> 00:49:25,333
SAM: I can't kill the dog! I told my friend I
would--

755
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,939
TALIESIN: Your friend is dead 10,000 years ago!

756
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:29,557
TRAVIS: Take a shot at it!

757
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:35,931
SAM: I will not take a shot at it. I will nock an
arrow and be ready, but I will not provoke

758
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,059
something that isn't threatening us.

759
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,951
TALIESIN: Let's head towards the valet.

760
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:45,395
LAURA: I want to quietly walk out and see if I can
climb the leg sticking up so I can see around the

761
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:46,499
lot--

762
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:51,271
LIAM: You know where you are, right? You're
outside the building of ADR5, the leg is 50

763
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:52,226
yards.

764
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:56,008
LAURA: It's not that far! Really? It doesn't
look that far.

765
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:57,515
SAM: It's a block. Should be a block.

766
00:49:57,616 --> 00:49:59,606
LAURA: All right.

767
00:49:59,606 --> 00:50:03,631
LIAM: You can stealth over there. Y'all can. Or
just one person.

768
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:08,709
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently stealth towards the
valet.

769
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:12,990
LIAM: You're in a new time or dimension. You're
making a new stealth check.

770
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,591
LAURA: I rolled so well last time.

771
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:19,804
TALIESIN: Yo! God, I'm killing it.

772
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:22,297
LAURA: I'm really scared for that giant thing we
saw.

773
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:24,694
SAM: Okay. I'm holding Bixby.

774
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:27,295
LIAM: Oh, you are holding Bixby? All right, so you
roll--

775
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:30,267
SAM: I rolled a 19 for me and a three for Bixby.

776
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,020
TALIESIN: He's just gassy.

777
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,147
LIAM: I was going to say roll with disadvantage,
so we'll call that the roll for you both. What'd

778
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:38,562
everybody else get?

779
00:50:38,562 --> 00:50:39,714
TRAVIS: Ten!

780
00:50:39,714 --> 00:50:40,791
LAURA: 11.

781
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,572
TALIESIN: 20.

782
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,569
LIAM: 20.

783
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,436
TALIESIN: I'm using a new die. I don't even know
what's happening.

784
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:48,151
LIAM: Okay. All right, well, you start slorping
through the mud and water.

785
00:50:48,151 --> 00:50:53,158
SAM: I'm proficient in stealth. Does that mean
anything?

786
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:59,282
TALIESIN: If it's marsh, I wear clogs for god's
sake. My shoes are useless. This is going to be

787
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:00,499
awful.

788
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:05,103
LIAM: Bixby is just as scared as the rest of you
and doesn't have the senses you all do, so of

789
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,173
course, he lets out a little (barks).

790
00:51:07,173 --> 00:51:08,590
LAURA: Oh no. (shushes)

791
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,305
LIAM: And you hear a (slurping noises).

792
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:15,017
LAURA: Can we take off running? I run. I start
running.

793
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:17,190
LIAM: Roll for initiative.

794
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,541
LAURA: Oh no! I don't want to fight it. Oh no!

795
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:27,050
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

796
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,952
LIAM: Hold onto that thought for a minute, okay.

797
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:33,657
TALIESIN: Okay, there's a roll.

798
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:42,002
SAM: This wasn't the thing you had prepared? He's
rolling with us tonight. The whole map, and we

799
00:51:42,002 --> 00:51:43,843
just blew right past it.

800
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:46,111
LIAM: Here's the tower leg.

801
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:50,596
LAURA: And this is all muck around us? Do we have
little figures?

802
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:55,584
LIAM: You sure do. No one makes Travis and Laura
and Taliesin and Sam miniatures, so this is

803
00:51:55,584 --> 00:52:06,854
Travis. He's a half-orc. This is Sam as a ranger.
Here is a nice goth warlock for Taliesin. But the

804
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:11,855
best one really is-- and I thought this when I got
it. Oh, where the hell is it? Is a miniature that

805
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:16,142
looks like fucking Laura Bailey. And it's missing.
Oh shit, where is she? There she is.

806
00:52:16,142 --> 00:52:19,477
LAURA: You sent me a picture of it.

807
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:22,134
LIAM: It's just Laura. So here she is.

808
00:52:22,134 --> 00:52:24,700
TRAVIS: I'm out in front.

809
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,997
LIAM: Yep.

810
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:28,614
SAM: Hey, Laura, you know how beasts work.

811
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:34,828
LAURA: Yeah, totally. I am really good with
animals, I just want to say.

812
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,382
LIAM: Okay, here we go, so. 20 to 25?

813
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:38,767
TRAVIS: 20!

814
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:43,106
LIAM: 20, okay. I just get to write down Travis and
write 20 next to it. 15 to 20?

815
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:44,460
SAM: 17.

816
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,275
LIAM: 17. Okay, Ten to 15.

817
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:50,157
LAURA: Ten. Oh no, Tal.

818
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:52,901
TALIESIN: Five.

819
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:56,838
TRAVIS: That's low for you, Taliesin. Have you
ever rolled below a ten?

820
00:52:56,838 --> 00:52:59,997
TALIESIN: Percy is not capable of rolling below a
ten.

821
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:03,910
SAM: Can I command the beast? Is that an action to
command the beast?

822
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,892
LAURA: What are you talking about? Can you command
beasts, Sam?

823
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,392
SAM: I'm a beastmaster ranger with a dog.

824
00:53:10,392 --> 00:53:16,609
LIAM: Travis, there is a spawn of fucking hell
slithering through the pond towards you right now.

825
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:20,048
And you're up with a sword in your hand. What do
you want to do?

826
00:53:20,048 --> 00:53:22,161
TRAVIS: I notice in my equipment--

827
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,152
LIAM: Less crosstalk!

828
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:27,398
TRAVIS: I notice that I have a full gym bag in my
equipment.

829
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:29,049
LIAM: You do have a full gym bag. That's right.

830
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:31,228
TRAVIS: Do I have it?

831
00:53:31,228 --> 00:53:33,511
LIAM: I don't know, did you grab it on the way
out? You can say yes.

832
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,010
TRAVIS: I totally did.

833
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,600
LIAM: Over your shoulder. There's probably
something useful in there.

834
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,329
SAM: Shit! When we were in the recording studio, I
should have had advantage on everything because my

835
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,523
favored terrain is recording studios.

836
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:48,029
(laughter)

837
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,833
SAM: But I didn't take it.

838
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:56,620
TRAVIS: I would like to, with my movement speed of
35, I would like to draw its attention away from

839
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:05,328
my beautiful bride and swing out to the right and
try and move out to a flank so that I spread out

840
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:06,697
its focus.

841
00:54:06,697 --> 00:54:10,083
LIAM: Okay, it's really difficult terrain, so
you're going at half speed here. So you can go

842
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,523
one, two, three here.

843
00:54:11,523 --> 00:54:14,550
TRAVIS: One, two, three, okay. I'll move in front
of my wife, how about that?

844
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,735
LIAM: Here, you want to be here?

845
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:17,114
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's good.

846
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:18,935
LIAM: And do you want to hold? Hold your action?

847
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:20,168
TRAVIS: And from there--

848
00:54:20,168 --> 00:54:21,896
LAURA: Throw some gym equipment at it.

849
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:24,115
TRAVIS: I only have a sword. I can't do anything.

850
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:26,151
LAURA: Don't you have a dumbbell or something?

851
00:54:26,151 --> 00:54:32,980
TRAVIS: Nobody carries dumbbells around! I take
out a packet of protein powder, and I throw it--

852
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,435
TALIESIN: Protein powder style.

853
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:39,187
TRAVIS: But like a grenade, I tear the lid off.

854
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:40,793
LAURA: It's a Clif bar!

855
00:54:40,793 --> 00:54:46,115
TRAVIS: No, those are good. And then I throw it,
like a (powder explosion), hoping to blind the

856
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:46,962
beast.

857
00:54:46,962 --> 00:54:48,768
LIAM: Okay, make a roll to attack.

858
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:53,887
TRAVIS: Okay. Eat building amino acids! 21!

859
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:59,478
LIAM: 21. It lands right in front of it and hits
it on the lower-- I mean, it's a big tentacled

860
00:54:59,478 --> 00:55:04,150
face, and there's a second mouth on the inside,
all the little beaky claws on the inside.

861
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,407
LAURA: Does the protein powder gunk up its
tentacles?

862
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:10,500
LIAM: It poofs in its face and it does the
equivalent of a (sneezing).

863
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,357
TRAVIS: I think I made it stronger.

864
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:16,379
LIAM: (laughing) Sam, you're up.

865
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:21,425
SAM: Wait. The beast knows we're there and is
eating protein right now.

866
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:24,286
TRAVIS: It could be choking on it. You don't
know.

867
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:28,140
SAM: I'm going to-- wait, is that a pool?

868
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:34,686
LIAM: This is like a two-foot-deep pond, a fetid
pond in a swamp.

869
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:44,776
SAM: Okay. I'm going to set Bixby down and tell
him to protect Laura.

870
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:46,243
LAURA: Oh, thanks.

871
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:47,810
SAM: Well, she's a dainty girl.

872
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,034
LAURA: Right.

873
00:55:49,034 --> 00:55:56,449
SAM: Not at all. (laughs) No. I set the thing
down, and I take my bow and arrow, and I'm going

874
00:55:56,449 --> 00:56:03,074
to attempt to shoot the beast. I'm going to roll.
I don't know what I add to it.

875
00:56:03,074 --> 00:56:05,963
LIAM: I've got it written on your sheet.

876
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:09,511
SAM: Well, is it this plus four for the bow?

877
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,745
LIAM: Plus four to hit.

878
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:13,672
SAM: Okay, so that's a 12.

879
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:19,018
LIAM: That's your total? The arrow whiffs past and
sinks (splash) into the water behind it.

880
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:21,364
LAURA: Oh! Do you get another arrow?

881
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:24,147
SAM: No. I'm a level-one ranger.

882
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,447
LIAM: Okay, Laura, you're up. Laura Bailey.

883
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:28,691
SAM: Wait, I get movement still, don't I?

884
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:30,273
LIAM: Sure you do. I'm new at this, Sam.

885
00:56:30,273 --> 00:56:33,615
SAM: I'm going to use my movement to run behind
Taliesin.

886
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:40,226
LIAM: Okay, cool. You're not slowed down because
you're on land, so okay, got it.

887
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:41,943
LAURA: Good. We're all lined up. This is smart.

888
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:44,189
LIAM: Laura, you're up.

889
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:47,041
LAURA: Well. Can I throw a dagger?

890
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,343
LIAM: Sure!

891
00:56:48,343 --> 00:56:51,696
LAURA: But I'll lose it! I don't have a Belt of
Returning!

892
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:56,518
LIAM: What is that? You might be able to fish it
out of there.

893
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,188
LAURA: Does it look like the water's very deep?

894
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:01,399
LIAM: It's about a foot and a half, maybe?

895
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:02,708
LAURA: What should I do?

896
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,923
LIAM: Do something, or I'm going to pass you by.

897
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:14,073
LAURA: No! Okay! I'm going to throw one of my
daggers at-- is that stupid?

898
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:15,445
TRAVIS: Just do it!

899
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,668
LIAM: I'll say that there were three in that
pile.

900
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:21,222
LAURA: I have three daggers. Okay, I'm going to
take one of them. Dagger, dagger, dagger, and I'm

901
00:57:21,222 --> 00:57:22,435
going to dagger!

902
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:23,889
LIAM: Okay, great, that's all you can do.

903
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:26,511
LAURA: And I'm hiding behind Travis. Am I hidden?

904
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:38,090
LIAM: I will say that you are. I'll say that it is
momentarily blinded by protein powder.

905
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,716
LAURA: 20!

906
00:57:39,716 --> 00:57:41,156
LIAM: 20 hits.

907
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:43,144
LAURA: What do I roll for my--

908
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:45,245
LIAM: It's written on your sheet, and you get
sneak attack damage.

909
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:46,921
LAURA: But what is the dagger damage?

910
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:53,497
LIAM: 1d4. Plus any damage bonus you have. I have it
written here in case you guys-- So plus three on

911
00:57:53,497 --> 00:57:54,819
the damage.

912
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,794
LAURA: Ugh! Five! Total!

913
00:57:57,794 --> 00:57:59,313
LIAM: Did you roll sneak attack, too?

914
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:01,558
LAURA: I did! It was a one. I know!

915
00:58:01,558 --> 00:58:03,749
LIAM: One plus three plus one. Is that what you
got?

916
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:05,558
LAURA: I rolled ones on both dice.

917
00:58:05,558 --> 00:58:11,195
LIAM: All right, well, the knife sinks into-- it
has eight eyes, all in a circle around its mouth.

918
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:15,270
It slices right into one of its eyes, which sort
of just (bloop) and a little bit of mucus or pus

919
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:16,302
flies out.

920
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:17,778
LAURA: And then I hide behind Travis again.

921
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:20,154
LIAM: Okay. Taliesin.

922
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:21,403
TALIESIN: Yeah?

923
00:58:21,403 --> 00:58:27,184
LIAM: Your headache, seeing this thing, throbs
harder than ever it did before, and you start to

924
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:34,464
see through a haze of black, almost like a veil
has been held over your eyes and you look down and

925
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:41,820
you see almost like the outlines of black
tentacles on your own hands.

926
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:47,652
LAURA: (gasps) Can we see that?! What the fuck,
Taliesin?!

927
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:50,496
TRAVIS: Anime porn.

928
00:58:50,496 --> 00:58:57,099
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hentai this thing.
I'm going to do my best to concentrate at it and

929
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:58,856
see if something happens.

930
00:58:58,856 --> 00:59:00,824
LIAM: Okay, you want to give it your all?

931
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:01,830
TALIESIN: No.

932
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,083
TRAVIS: Why not?!

933
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,006
TALIESIN: I want to just-- This feels weird and I
feel stupid.

934
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:12,491
LIAM: All right, roll to attack.

935
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:19,360
TALIESIN: Roll to attack? What do I add to my--
well, it's been a while, I'll find out. What do I

936
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,324
add to my roll to attack?

937
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,424
LIAM: It's on your spell sheet.

938
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:27,891
TALIESIN: Oh, spell save attack bonus? So that's
14.

939
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:29,444
LIAM: What's the, there's a plus.

940
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:30,534
TALIESIN: Five plus one.

941
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:31,831
LIAM: So you take that plus.

942
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:33,502
TALIESIN: Oh, so just the plus one?

943
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:36,037
LIAM: No, you take whatever the number is there
plus the plus one.

944
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,141
SAM: Plus six.

945
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:39,425
TALIESIN: So. 14

946
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:50,634
LIAM: This black tentacle lashes out. You guys all
see that. You guys all see it come out of his

947
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:56,716
hand. It splashes in the water right next to it,
right next to it. And it goes (gurgling growl) and

948
00:59:56,716 --> 00:59:59,738
it cowers? (monster noises)

949
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:03,507
SAM: The thing we're fighting cowered?

950
01:00:03,507 --> 01:00:13,107
LIAM: It cowered. It's looking past Travis to see
you. It then in anger goes (monster gargles)

951
01:00:13,158 --> 01:00:20,365
and flies through the water, right at you. What's
your AC? Travis.

952
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:21,868
TRAVIS: 12.

953
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:30,909
LIAM: 12? Yeah, that hits. The thing's tentacles
(hissing) and it latches onto your torso.

954
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:32,753
TRAVIS and LAURA: (scream)

955
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:36,264
LIAM: You take one point of damage.

956
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:38,487
TRAVIS: That's a lot for me!

957
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:45,351
LIAM: And then, as this thing's facial tentacles
wrap around your chest, it then pulls itself in and

958
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:51,828
you see the round mouth of teeth come in for a
second strike, clamp onto your nipple and sink in,

959
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:56,141
super sharp, for two more hit points.

960
01:00:56,141 --> 01:01:01,835
LAURA: We don't have a lot of health!

961
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:03,982
TRAVIS: You saw Aliens! Kill me!

962
01:01:03,982 --> 01:01:07,310
LIAM: (laughing) Travis, you're up.

963
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,619
TRAVIS: I'm up?

964
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,039
SAM: You're grappled.

965
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:15,885
TRAVIS: I take the berserker sword and I take it
with both hands and I start trying to shave the cheese off of

966
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:17,198
my chest

967
01:01:17,198 --> 01:01:23,058
LIAM: I'll call that an attack, sure. Roll to hit.
Do it.

968
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:24,909
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

969
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:27,484
(laughter)

970
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:31,499
LIAM: This game never gets old!

971
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:34,789
TRAVIS: What's the damage die for a maniac
sword?

972
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:36,885
LIAM: Maniac sword is 2d6.

973
01:01:36,885 --> 01:01:40,139
TALIESIN: 2d6 times two.

974
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:42,775
LIAM: Times two, correct.

975
01:01:42,775 --> 01:01:46,200
TRAVIS: Seven, 15 times two is 30.

976
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,595
LIAM: 30?! What did you roll initially?

977
01:01:49,595 --> 01:01:52,435
TRAVIS: So I did four, and the damage type is plus
four.

978
01:01:52,435 --> 01:01:55,469
TALIESIN: You don't-- double the dice. You just
double the dice.

979
01:01:55,469 --> 01:02:00,038
TRAVIS: So it was seven plus four. 11, times two.
22.

980
01:02:00,038 --> 01:02:04,148
LIAM: What did you roll on the dice alone? Just
tell me what you rolled on the dice.

981
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:05,732
TRAVIS: Four and a three.

982
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,476
LIAM: That's seven, so 14. Plus the modifier.

983
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:10,271
TRAVIS: 18.

984
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:12,575
TALIESIN: Pretty good! That would have killed any
of us.

985
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:19,658
LIAM: The sword cuts down through its face, down
through its body. You peel off a piece of

986
01:02:19,658 --> 01:02:29,047
bacon from this thing. And it shrivels up, it
shrieks right in your face (shriek). It falls onto

987
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:31,780
the ground right at your feet.

988
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,184
LAURA: Is it dead, is it dead?

989
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:36,001
LIAM: It's still juking around a little bit. Sam,
you're up.

990
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:45,558
SAM: I say, Bixby, go retrieve my arrow that I
shot over there, and then I will nock another one.

991
01:02:45,558 --> 01:02:48,045
Am I too close to it to attack this?

992
01:02:48,045 --> 01:02:53,501
LIAM: Bixby disappears under the surface of the
water. Well, you don't have a good line of sight.

993
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:59,529
SAM: Okay. Well, then I'm going to step out from
around Taliesin so I got a good shot. Am I in

994
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:01,192
danger of hitting Travis?

995
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:02,791
LIAM: No, not unless you roll a one.

996
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:10,595
SAM: Okay, so I will fire again. Okay. What do I
add, plus four? 20.

997
01:03:10,595 --> 01:03:17,622
LIAM: Okay. You've only fired bows at Ren Faire,
but fuck it. (arrow noise) The arrow (impact)

998
01:03:17,622 --> 01:03:20,949
strikes it into another eye. It goes (gargle).

999
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:23,479
SAM: I look at Laura. See? I'm good.

1000
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:26,777
TRAVIS: Did you kill it?!

1001
01:03:26,777 --> 01:03:28,430
LAURA: Is it dead?

1002
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,832
LIAM: It's not moving.

1003
01:03:29,832 --> 01:03:32,869
LAURA: I run up and I grab my dagger out of that
thing.

1004
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:36,740
LIAM: Out of it? Yeah, it is in its eye, that's
right. Bixby's splashing in the water.

1005
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,597
(gurgling noises)

1006
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:40,308
SAM: Is he drowning?

1007
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:41,532
LIAM: I don't know.

1008
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:42,982
LAURA: (gasps) Go get Bixby!

1009
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:45,929
TRAVIS: He's a pug; they don't swim well.

1010
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:49,342
SAM: Okay, I'll use my movement to retrieve
Bixby.

1011
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:54,012
LIAM: (laughing) Okay. All right, you splash into
the water; you wade in. He was drowning. You pull

1012
01:03:54,012 --> 01:03:56,858
him up and he splutters. You hold him upside-down
and shake him a little bit.

1013
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:59,047
LAURA: Why would you tell him to go get the
arrow?

1014
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:02,108
SAM: I'm a beastmaster. I command beasts.

1015
01:04:02,108 --> 01:04:10,357
LIAM: You notice, Taliesin, that rod you were
holding, with the etched tentacles in it. When you

1016
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:15,219
hold it, this arm, that black aura
grows larger than in the other hand.

1017
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:18,555
LAURA: Ugh, Taliesin, you have a tentacle hand.

1018
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:29,153
TALIESIN: Wait. I'm going to try something. I'm
going to try to fire something with the not

1019
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:31,723
tentacle hand at the dead creature.

1020
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:34,052
SAM: It's dead. We know this, right?

1021
01:04:34,052 --> 01:04:37,375
TALIESIN: No, he's not moving, that doesn't mean
dead. I'm going to try.

1022
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:43,446
LIAM: Yeah, black tentacles. They're not solid,
you can see through it. But it swirls in a spiral

1023
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:48,757
and then lashes into it and picks it up and
squeezes. And it (spurting) and a couple more eyes

1024
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:51,495
go (spurting) and it lands on the ground.

1025
01:04:51,495 --> 01:04:53,547
SAM: Oh shit. What is that move?

1026
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,129
LAURA: Why didn't you do that earlier?

1027
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:57,440
TALIESIN: Because it was moving earlier. This is
weird!

1028
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,660
TRAVIS: Is this helping your headache at all?

1029
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,851
LIAM: Your headache is a little better. It's not
gone, but it's better.

1030
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:02,978
TALIESIN: Feeling better.

1031
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:09,371
LAURA: Oh my gosh, this is really freaking weird.
Let's get out of here.

1032
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:11,110
TALIESIN: You have all your knives?

1033
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:14,962
LAURA: I've got my daggers, I've got my backpack,
let's get out of here.

1034
01:05:14,962 --> 01:05:17,698
TALIESIN: Do we see any golf carts or our cars
left?

1035
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:20,001
LIAM: Make an investigation check.

1036
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:21,644
TALIESIN: Right.

1037
01:05:21,644 --> 01:05:26,432
LAURA: Can I look for our Jeep? I'm going to look
for our cars, too.

1038
01:05:26,432 --> 01:05:27,700
TRAVIS: 14!

1039
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,836
LAURA: Oh, I drove here separately! 20!

1040
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:32,997
LIAM: 20?

1041
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:34,389
TALIESIN: Eight.

1042
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:38,307
LIAM: You guys look through the vegetation, you
take 15 minutes to dig through here, and there's

1043
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:44,804
other sections where there's more fetid water, and
there's bugs that are biting, and it smells like

1044
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:54,032
ass in a lot of places. You do find a car. The
wheels are pudding. The windows are gone. It is

1045
01:05:54,032 --> 01:06:00,014
smashed all to hell, and there's vines and leaves
and ivy growing in it and around it.

1046
01:06:00,014 --> 01:06:01,781
SAM: Is it a blue Prius?

1047
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:05,329
TALIESIN: Is it a blue Scion or the remnants of a
blue Scion?

1048
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:11,041
LIAM: Everything is brown underneath plant life.
You got up to the point where everybody parks when

1049
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:16,005
you are visiting for VO, and you're at the base,
and you can see, sticking out, the contours of the

1050
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:23,081
water tower are there, but it's totally covered
over. You can see the street that goes past that,

1051
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:28,621
that leads into the pretend town, and the only
reason you know it is because you've been here

1052
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:35,665
so many times. You recognize the contours of this
canyon swooping around, but you do see one piece

1053
01:06:35,665 --> 01:06:44,068
of what looks like a stoop in a Brooklyn building,
nonsensically out of this tropical setting.

1054
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:45,851
LAURA: Can we climb it?

1055
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,743
SAM: We've got to go find Ashley!

1056
01:06:49,743 --> 01:06:55,265
TRAVIS: Let's take a look from a vantage point.
The tower's right here.

1057
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:59,326
SAM: But the tower's only one leg. We can't climb
one leg of a tower.

1058
01:06:59,326 --> 01:07:01,247
TALIESIN: No, it's the fake Brooklyn building.

1059
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,749
LIAM: What do you want to climb?

1060
01:07:03,749 --> 01:07:05,715
LAURA: Whatever's sturdy!

1061
01:07:05,715 --> 01:07:07,536
LIAM: I don't know what's sturdy.

1062
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,273
LAURA: What looks the sturdiest?

1063
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:12,324
SAM: You can certainly have a go, was that it?

1064
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:21,760
LIAM: You can certainly have at it! Fake Town is
like a canyon covered in green. The tower is a

1065
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,709
hump. There are plenty of vines on it. You could
give it a try, try and climb up a vine.

1066
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,451
LAURA: I'm pretty good at climbing.

1067
01:07:29,451 --> 01:07:31,461
LIAM: It's less scary than the absolute straight
up.

1068
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:33,763
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to try to climb the thing.

1069
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,250
LIAM: All right, make an athletics check.

1070
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,818
TRAVIS: We'll keep watch on the ground.

1071
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:42,371
LAURA: I like that I really put my backpack on. I
feel like we're on a mission right now. Oh no!

1072
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:46,020
What is it, athletics? Oh no. It's a seven.

1073
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,001
LIAM: Okay, it's really tough.

1074
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:52,048
LAURA: (shouts) Travis, push my butt so I can get
up higher.

1075
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:53,626
TRAVIS: Why don't I climb up?

1076
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:55,435
LAURA: Because it's going to break; you're too
big!

1077
01:07:55,435 --> 01:07:57,600
SAM: You are pretty big.

1078
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,326
LIAM: Part of the problem is that the vines are
breaking away in your hand, so you can't get a

1079
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:03,637
firm grip on it.

1080
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:04,698
LAURA: See?

1081
01:08:04,698 --> 01:08:07,034
TRAVIS: It looks a little dangerous. I don't know
if you should go up there.

1082
01:08:07,034 --> 01:08:11,412
TALIESIN: Wait, maybe if we try to cut through the
vines and get into the doors. They have those

1083
01:08:11,412 --> 01:08:15,442
awful little stairs inside these buildings,
anyway. We could maybe just climb up inside.

1084
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:17,735
TRAVIS: Use the sword on the door?

1085
01:08:17,735 --> 01:08:20,336
TALIESIN: On the vines to get to the door.

1086
01:08:20,336 --> 01:08:21,968
TRAVIS: Yeah, I bushwhack them.

1087
01:08:21,968 --> 01:08:29,001
LIAM: On the side of Fake Town, you mean? Is
everybody going to follow? Make a survival check.

1088
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:35,269
TRAVIS: All right. 12!

1089
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:37,735
LIAM: There's a fucking door under there.

1090
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:39,355
TRAVIS: There's a door under there!

1091
01:08:39,355 --> 01:08:40,811
LIAM: It's coming away.

1092
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:41,913
LAURA: Open it!

1093
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:48,652
SAM: I'm going to tell Bixby: hey, Bixby. Hey,
buddy. Can you watch our back, and if anything

1094
01:08:48,652 --> 01:08:50,276
comes, bark?

1095
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:52,432
LIAM: (panting)

1096
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:59,149
SAM: I think he understood me. Just stay. Stay and
watch.

1097
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:02,079
TRAVIS: Can I try the door?

1098
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,916
LIAM: Oh yeah. It pushes in, in fact it
disintegrates as you push through.

1099
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,521
TRAVIS: Okay, there are termites.

1100
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:12,045
LIAM: You're in. It's really mushy. There's much
less vegetation in here, although it has crept its

1101
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:19,130
way in here. And you do see wooden stairs.
Obviously not a Brooklyn building because it was

1102
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:24,881
all fake when they made this, whenever they made
it. But there is wooden stairs going up. Want to

1103
01:09:24,881 --> 01:09:26,044
go up?

1104
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:27,580
TRAVIS: Do we go up?

1105
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,833
TALIESIN: You go up. You're light. We stay down
here.

1106
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,836
LAURA: Okay.

1107
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:33,547
SAM: I'm not going to let her go up there by
herself!

1108
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:37,915
LAURA: No, it's okay. I'm small. I'll be quiet. I'm
gonna try to be as quiet as possible and climb the

1109
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:38,789
stairs.

1110
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:42,318
LIAM: Okay, make a stealth check.

1111
01:09:42,318 --> 01:09:44,014
SAM: Take your phone and text us!

1112
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,842
LAURA: Our phones don't work, stupid.

1113
01:09:45,842 --> 01:09:47,271
SAM: Well, maybe text still works.

1114
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,182
TALIESIN: Text doesn't work here.

1115
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:52,623
LAURA: (whispers) What is that, what does that add
to? 22!

1116
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,619
LIAM: Okay. Now make an acrobatics check.

1117
01:09:55,619 --> 01:10:01,048
LAURA: Oh, come on! 15!

1118
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:02,814
SAM: And now an animal handling check!

1119
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:04,784
(laughter)

1120
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:10,852
LIAM: You make your way in. You guys can't hear
her after she rounds a corner and you see, as you

1121
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:14,248
gently put your toes down in different places-- By
the way, your phone is dead.

1122
01:10:14,248 --> 01:10:16,403
LAURA: Oh no, it already died?

1123
01:10:16,403 --> 01:10:18,712
TRAVIS: That's what you get if you look at Twitter
your whole session.

1124
01:10:18,712 --> 01:10:21,996
(laughter)

1125
01:10:21,996 --> 01:10:26,450
LIAM: You gingerly place your feet down, and
you're seeing parts where the wood gives way, but

1126
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:32,381
you're finding a few places that are firm. It's a
little jittery, but you get up to the second floor

1127
01:10:32,381 --> 01:10:38,859
of this fake building. There is a window you can
see, it is entirely dusted over on the other side,

1128
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:42,163
and you can see all this leaves and stuff on the
other side.

1129
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:43,647
LAURA: Can I push through the leaves?

1130
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:44,795
LIAM: You've got to open the window.

1131
01:10:44,795 --> 01:10:46,027
LAURA: I open the window.

1132
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:47,546
LIAM: Okay. Make a strength check.

1133
01:10:47,546 --> 01:10:53,507
LAURA: Come on! 14!

1134
01:10:53,507 --> 01:10:58,741
LIAM: Yeah! Slides right up. Part of it comes off
in your hands as mush and pudding, you throw it

1135
01:10:58,741 --> 01:11:06,593
down. There is a veil of plants. You spend a
minute pulling it aside. You're looking down,

1136
01:11:06,593 --> 01:11:11,352
around, you went up to the bend, and on the corner
you're now looking down to where you once knew,

1137
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:16,749
outdoor tables, and the bathrooms, and the
commissary, the cafeteria. You can kind of make

1138
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:19,962
out, just because of your memory, you know the
distance.

1139
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:21,625
LAURA: Do I see the Starbucks?

1140
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,830
LIAM: No. You see trees.

1141
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:27,581
LAURA: Do I see anything moving?

1142
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:39,159
LIAM: You see a seam in the sky go (ripping). Like
a wound above, yellow viscous fluid comes

1143
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:47,914
and pours and pours and keeps pouring out
of the sky and splashes down into this canyon and

1144
01:11:47,914 --> 01:11:52,888
starts spreading in both directions, towards where
the commissary used to be and towards where the

1145
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:58,938
tower was. It doesn't look like water, it doesn't
look like snot, it's somewhere in-between. Like

1146
01:11:58,938 --> 01:12:00,243
Vegemite.

1147
01:12:00,243 --> 01:12:02,018
TRAVIS: We're going up.

1148
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,133
SAM and TALIESIN: We can't see.

1149
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,245
TALIESIN: We don't know this is happening yet.

1150
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:10,385
LIAM: The rift goes (tearing) and it's gone. It's
just blue sky.

1151
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:18,491
LAURA: Guys! I run down. Can I go back down?
There's ooze coming out of the sky and filling

1152
01:12:18,491 --> 01:12:22,277
up-- like yellow gunk filling up out of the sky.

1153
01:12:22,277 --> 01:12:23,457
SAM: Where?

1154
01:12:23,457 --> 01:12:25,646
LAURA: The sky opened up and then this stuff fell
out.

1155
01:12:25,646 --> 01:12:27,160
SAM: And what do you want us to do?

1156
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,340
LAURA: I don't know!

1157
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,066
TALIESIN: I'm going to look outside.

1158
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:35,706
LAURA: I didn't see anything moving. Is it coming
towards us?

1159
01:12:35,706 --> 01:12:38,868
LIAM: Are you looking out the door now?

1160
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,362
TALIESIN: I'm looking out the door now.

1161
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:47,339
LIAM: There is a frigging foot deep of yellow pus
just everywhere.

1162
01:12:47,339 --> 01:12:49,780
SAM: Bixby! Bixby, come!

1163
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,466
LIAM: He does come, and he is coated.

1164
01:12:53,466 --> 01:12:55,155
SAM: I'm sorry, boy.

1165
01:12:55,155 --> 01:12:56,431
TRAVIS: How's he doing?

1166
01:12:56,431 --> 01:13:03,093
LIAM: He's losing his hair. He's balding a bit.

1167
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:06,250
LAURA: I get some Kleenex out of my purse and I
try to get it off of him.

1168
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:09,491
LIAM: You wipe it away, hair comes away as you wipe.

1169
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:12,836
TALIESIN: Nair. It's made of Nair.

1170
01:13:12,836 --> 01:13:17,308
SAM: Yeah, so maybe we go up? Can we go across the
rooftops? Did you see?

1171
01:13:17,308 --> 01:13:19,509
TALIESIN: That's a terrible idea.

1172
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:22,478
SAM: Did you see a way? A path?

1173
01:13:22,478 --> 01:13:24,749
LIAM: You may indubitably give it your best
effort!

1174
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:29,502
LAURA: I lead them up the stair path that I
found.

1175
01:13:29,502 --> 01:13:32,827
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, you're able to do that. Everyone
is able to follow. You show them where not to

1176
01:13:32,827 --> 01:13:33,738
step.

1177
01:13:33,738 --> 01:13:36,257
LAURA: Don't step here. Don't step in that spot.

1178
01:13:36,257 --> 01:13:37,741
TRAVIS: I step there, anyway.

1179
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:39,395
LIAM: Travis, roll a d20.

1180
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:41,878
TRAVIS: (laughs) Nine!

1181
01:13:41,878 --> 01:13:51,620
LIAM: You're okay. Not a high bar to cross. Just
wanted you to sweat because it's fun. You make it

1182
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:57,345
up. You find all of these buildings are connected
on the inside because it was all bullshit; it was

1183
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:58,496
all magic.

1184
01:13:58,496 --> 01:14:00,876
SAM: So we can just walk across the rooftops?

1185
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:02,380
LIAM: It'll take some doing, but probably.

1186
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,502
LAURA: Let's do that.

1187
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:04,592
SAM: Towards the cafeteria.

1188
01:14:04,592 --> 01:14:05,771
LAURA: Towards the commissary.

1189
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:09,399
SAM: Wait. From our vantage point does it look
like Warner Brothers Studios is the epicenter of

1190
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:13,701
this or can we see parts of Burbank and television
city?

1191
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:15,571
LIAM: You look out, you don't see buildings.

1192
01:14:15,571 --> 01:14:20,767
SAM: But does it seem to be originating from here?
Is it just everywhere?

1193
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:25,133
LIAM: As far as you can see, you see green. As far
as you can see.

1194
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:30,907
TRAVIS: It's The Last of Us, dude. It's all over. I
think we should eat Taliesin and move on.

1195
01:14:30,907 --> 01:14:36,437
TALIESIN: I think if it's The Last of Us, we need
Ashley Johnson, and then we can make a decision.

1196
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:39,350
TRAVIS: That's right! We heard her voice say in
the cafeteria!

1197
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,682
TALIESIN: This is not just about me not wanting to
submit to cannibalism.

1198
01:14:42,682 --> 01:14:45,583
TRAVIS: Let's use the building to get towards the
cafeteria.

1199
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,814
LAURA: Thanks. Good idea, Travis.

1200
01:14:47,814 --> 01:14:50,379
SAM: (laughs) God, he really is dumb.

1201
01:14:50,379 --> 01:14:52,982
TALIESIN: You should go first.

1202
01:14:52,982 --> 01:14:58,656
SAM: All right, I'll start going across the
rooftops or whatever.

1203
01:14:58,656 --> 01:15:01,419
LIAM: Where's Bixby, by the way?

1204
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:02,881
SAM: I'm holding him.

1205
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:04,375
TRAVIS: Is he melting yet?

1206
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,867
LAURA: I wiped all the stuff off of him.

1207
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:08,504
LIAM: As best you can tell, he's half-bald. He's
got patches of hair, patches of not.

1208
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,684
TRAVIS: (whispering) Why are we carrying the dog?

1209
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:13,840
SAM: I promised my friend that I would take care
of him this weekend.

1210
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,562
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure your friend's dead!

1211
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:20,493
SAM: A promise made is a promise kept, Travis!

1212
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:27,026
LIAM: To quote Matthew Mercer: in the interest of
time, you make your way through the upper floors

1213
01:15:27,026 --> 01:15:33,575
of Fake Town. You do get close, I think there's a
building that's not one of these things before.

1214
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:36,178
There's a full-on restaurant.

1215
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:44,975
SAM: As we go, I turn to Travis and say, hey, man,
listen. Just level with me. This was a

1216
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:47,507
single-scale session for me. Are you getting
double-scale?

1217
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:49,029
TRAVIS: Single, really?

1218
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:51,010
SAM: Yeah. Are they paying you more than me?

1219
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:55,088
TRAVIS: I don't ever really look at those things.

1220
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:59,710
SAM: Come on, just level with me. I asked my
agent. She said it was most favored nations.

1221
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,981
TRAVIS: You told them it was vocally stressful,
right?

1222
01:16:01,981 --> 01:16:04,681
LAURA: Sam, I'm pretty sure we're not getting paid
for that session.

1223
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,857
SAM: I need that money!

1224
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:08,241
LAURA: Your house is gone.

1225
01:16:08,241 --> 01:16:13,630
TRAVIS: You got gold in your pocket right now. You
and I have dinero.

1226
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:17,987
SAM: I just value my talents as much as yours and
I think I should be compensated just as much.

1227
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:22,348
TALIESIN: I'm still a little upset that we talked
about eating me before the dog, which is really--

1228
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:26,865
TRAVIS: He was covered with that goo.

1229
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:32,663
LIAM: Not in the building you're in, but you do
hear leaves rustling around. You hear something.

1230
01:16:32,663 --> 01:16:37,721
It sounds like one source of movement in
vegetation.

1231
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:39,813
LAURA: Can we see where it is?

1232
01:16:39,813 --> 01:16:43,350
LIAM: You heard it through the windows. You're
inside one of these buildings.

1233
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:46,318
TALIESIN: Do I have any power left to my phone?

1234
01:16:46,318 --> 01:16:49,201
LIAM: None of your phones work. They're all
black.

1235
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:53,147
LAURA: I want to peek out from the vines again. I
open the window and look out the vines.

1236
01:16:53,147 --> 01:17:01,825
LIAM: There's another little canyon of plant life,
and you do actually see, somehow, one corner of a

1237
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:07,758
metal table is managing to poke through all this
shit. But you see a bird (fluttering sound) land

1238
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:11,155
and sway on a vine. (fluttering sound) Fly off
again.

1239
01:17:11,155 --> 01:17:15,147
LAURA: (whispering) Well, birds are alive, still.
So it's not all weird creatures.

1240
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:17,013
TALIESIN: It was a normal-looking bird?

1241
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:19,332
LIAM: Yeah, it was totally normal looking. It was
a dove, I think.

1242
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:21,136
TALIESIN: That's helpful.

1243
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:25,963
TRAVIS: Noah's coming.

1244
01:17:25,963 --> 01:17:30,728
LAURA: Should we try to get outside and see what's
in the cafeteria?

1245
01:17:30,728 --> 01:17:33,515
SAM: Yeah, of course. How close are we, at this
point?

1246
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,436
LIAM: Super close. You're just in the building one
or two doors down.

1247
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:39,973
SAM: We've got to climb down? And do we have to
traverse ooze to get to it?

1248
01:17:39,973 --> 01:17:42,251
LIAM: I don't know. Got to get out there.

1249
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:46,522
TRAVIS: Is there anything linking the rooftops of
the two buildings? Any old power lines or power

1250
01:17:46,522 --> 01:17:48,397
poles that may have fallen over?

1251
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,234
TALIESIN: This is not Tomb Raider.

1252
01:17:50,234 --> 01:17:52,053
LIAM: You could make an investigation check, I
suppose.

1253
01:17:52,053 --> 01:17:53,663
SAM: There's vines, Travis.

1254
01:17:53,663 --> 01:17:58,158
TALIESIN: That looks like a very high number.

1255
01:17:58,158 --> 01:17:59,146
TRAVIS: 20.

1256
01:17:59,146 --> 01:18:06,502
LIAM: 20. You look all around. There doesn't
seem to be any trap doors or stairs. It seems

1257
01:18:06,502 --> 01:18:09,699
like this is as high as you go in this fake
building.

1258
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:11,345
TRAVIS: It seems like this is as high as we go.

1259
01:18:11,345 --> 01:18:13,287
LAURA: So maybe we should just get down to the
ground.

1260
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:17,748
SAM: Okay, but before we go, Laura, grab that
dagger of yours. Why don't you cut off that vine?

1261
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:20,653
That way we'll have at least a rope we can use for
something.

1262
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:25,152
LAURA: Good fucking call, Sam! I cut some vine
off, and I wrap it up like a little whip on my

1263
01:18:25,152 --> 01:18:26,371
side, there.

1264
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:27,925
TRAVIS: I have a jump rope in my gym bag.

1265
01:18:27,925 --> 01:18:30,100
SAM: Okay. That's six feet, right? Eight feet?

1266
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,676
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like seven. No, six feet.

1267
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:36,644
SAM: How long's this vine that we can cut down
here?

1268
01:18:36,644 --> 01:18:39,765
LIAM: Everybody make an athletics check on the way
down.

1269
01:18:39,765 --> 01:18:41,227
LAURA: Oh no.

1270
01:18:41,227 --> 01:18:44,765
TRAVIS: 21.

1271
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:46,150
LAURA: 16.

1272
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:47,706
TALIESIN: 12.

1273
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:48,997
SAM: Natural 20.

1274
01:18:48,997 --> 01:18:50,492
(oohing)

1275
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,154
TALIESIN: Did you roll for the dog, too?

1276
01:18:52,154 --> 01:18:53,492
SAM: I'm carrying the dog.

1277
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:57,810
LIAM: You guys all make your way down. Taliesin,
you step somewhere squishy and you fall straight

1278
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:02,939
down through the step. From six feet up, you hit
your tailbone super hard, fall on your ass on a

1279
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:08,136
knob of a tree stump or something. You take one
point of bludgeoning damage.

1280
01:19:08,136 --> 01:19:09,852
TALIESIN: Yep, that's a thing.

1281
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:13,972
SAM: Do you want to rest? Take that back? You're
going to need that hit point. You want to take a

1282
01:19:13,972 --> 01:19:15,074
little rest?

1283
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:19,236
TALIESIN: I don't know. This is not a game, man.
There's no hit points to get.

1284
01:19:19,236 --> 01:19:21,781
SAM: If we rest, you might feel one point better.

1285
01:19:21,781 --> 01:19:24,878
TRAVIS: This is some Stephen King-type shit. I
feel like in some alternate dimension, we're

1286
01:19:24,878 --> 01:19:26,618
killing ourselves right now.

1287
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:30,777
SAM: Wait, did you take some damage back there?
Maybe we should rest for a second.

1288
01:19:30,777 --> 01:19:32,917
TRAVIS: Before we cross the street?

1289
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:33,943
SAM: Yeah!

1290
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:35,493
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

1291
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:40,168
TALIESIN: Let's observe outside. I'm going to peek
outside.

1292
01:19:40,168 --> 01:19:43,859
LAURA: Can you walk? You hit your tailbone really
hard.

1293
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,287
TALIESIN: I can limp. I'm fine.

1294
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:49,084
LIAM: You're all right. You're embarrassed and
your butt bone hurts a ton.

1295
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:54,004
LAURA: I bet it's going to be really black. I've
fallen that hard before. It really sucks.

1296
01:19:54,004 --> 01:20:02,398
TALIESIN: If we live that long, I will take it up
with my SAG representative, and I will photograph

1297
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:12,483
it once my phone is working again. There was no
stunt coordinator in this VO session. So outside

1298
01:20:12,483 --> 01:20:13,669
is goop?

1299
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:15,565
LIAM: You're looking out now?

1300
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:16,777
TALIESIN: I'm looking out.

1301
01:20:16,777 --> 01:20:23,433
LIAM: You don't see a lot of goop. You see a lot
of tall grass and ferns growing out of it. You

1302
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:24,953
don't see any goop.

1303
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,569
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's foliage?

1304
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:30,785
LIAM: Tons of foliage. You're going to be up to
your nipples out there in plant.

1305
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:34,780
TALIESIN: Are there any phone lines still
hanging?

1306
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,610
LIAM: Not that you can see.

1307
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:39,681
TALIESIN: There was that table a while ago?

1308
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:41,144
SAM: That was back.

1309
01:20:41,144 --> 01:20:44,100
LIAM: Laura could explain to you where she saw
it.

1310
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,251
LAURA: Yeah, it was just right across the way,
there. One of the little tables.

1311
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:53,969
LIAM: So now you have a rough idea of where it
was. It wasn't exactly dead center. It was past

1312
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:56,654
center from where you guys are.

1313
01:20:56,654 --> 01:20:57,808
TALIESIN: All right.

1314
01:20:57,808 --> 01:21:00,247
SAM: So wait, there's no ooze?

1315
01:21:00,247 --> 01:21:01,846
TRAVIS: Not as much.

1316
01:21:01,846 --> 01:21:07,749
LIAM: From where he's standing, all he sees is
green. If you look to the right, you do see

1317
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:12,246
there's schmear on the sides of the canyon walls.

1318
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:13,776
TRAVIS: Like, bagel schmear?

1319
01:21:13,776 --> 01:21:16,227
LIAM: Yeah. No. Snot from the sky.

1320
01:21:16,227 --> 01:21:20,745
LAURA: Are there any loose pieces of wood sitting
around in the building? Can we rip some of the

1321
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:21,982
siding off?

1322
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:25,236
LIAM: Make a survival check.

1323
01:21:25,236 --> 01:21:29,950
LAURA: Five.

1324
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:36,128
LIAM: Five? You find a good grip on a piece of
wood. You rip it, and it's exactly that big and

1325
01:21:36,128 --> 01:21:37,780
everything stays behind.

1326
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:41,702
LAURA: I thought maybe we could like get some wood
off and--

1327
01:21:41,702 --> 01:21:43,457
SAM: What, are we going to make a raft or
something?

1328
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:47,474
LAURA: No. Put it down on the ground and walk
across it in case there's goop in the grass.

1329
01:21:47,474 --> 01:21:50,394
TRAVIS: I hate staying in one place for too long.
Maybe we just make a run for it.

1330
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:53,925
TALIESIN: Let's make a quiet walk of it.

1331
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:54,990
TRAVIS: Why?

1332
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:59,866
TALIESIN: Because you're not going to move fast
enough to outrun any of that weird shit in there.

1333
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:01,348
TRAVIS: I am super fast.

1334
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:03,871
LAURA: Travis. Can I have a piggyback ride?

1335
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:05,983
TRAVIS: That would make me much less fast.

1336
01:22:05,983 --> 01:22:08,172
LAURA: But I won't get my feet in the goop.

1337
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:10,596
TRAVIS: No.

1338
01:22:10,596 --> 01:22:13,752
LAURA: Please? Please, Travis. I'm your wife!

1339
01:22:13,752 --> 01:22:18,175
SAM: Laura, I'll give you a piggyback ride, and
I'll carry this dog at the same time.

1340
01:22:18,175 --> 01:22:22,386
LAURA: Thanks, Sam. I'll carry Bixby if you give
me a piggyback ride.

1341
01:22:22,386 --> 01:22:26,286
TALIESIN: Travis, can I get a piggyback ride,
please? Thank you. That's cool.

1342
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,709
TRAVIS: He said please.

1343
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,024
LAURA: Are you serious?

1344
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:31,797
TALIESIN: It's legitimately the magic word.

1345
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:33,589
TRAVIS: I just want respect.

1346
01:22:33,589 --> 01:22:36,501
LAURA: All right, I'm carrying Bixby and I'm on
Sam's back.

1347
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,169
LIAM: Are we running, or we're sneaking?

1348
01:22:38,169 --> 01:22:41,284
TRAVIS: We're sneaking through the grass because
we're a bunch of pusses.

1349
01:22:41,284 --> 01:22:43,279
LAURA: Are you stepping into any goop?

1350
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:44,907
LIAM: Everybody roll for stealth.

1351
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:46,920
TALIESIN: One gentle step at a time.

1352
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,105
LAURA: Should I roll for Bixby now that I'm
holding the dog?

1353
01:22:49,105 --> 01:22:50,444
LIAM: Yes.

1354
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:54,779
TRAVIS: Suck it! I've never been so stealthy in my
life! 20.

1355
01:22:54,779 --> 01:22:59,170
SAM: I'm 19. I got 19.

1356
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:00,151
TALIESIN: 17.

1357
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:02,020
LAURA: Nine and eight.

1358
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,165
LIAM: Nine and eight?

1359
01:23:03,165 --> 01:23:04,702
SAM: They're on my back.

1360
01:23:04,702 --> 01:23:06,192
TRAVIS: I've got Taliesin on my back.

1361
01:23:06,192 --> 01:23:08,532
LAURA: Oh wait, no, that's a lie! Nine and 13.

1362
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:12,500
LIAM: Okay. So who's on whose back?

1363
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,921
TRAVIS: Taliesin is on mine.

1364
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:16,162
SAM: I'm carrying Laura. Laura's got the dog.

1365
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:22,302
LIAM: You guys creep out. You place your feet down
in. It does feel a little juicy, but you can't

1366
01:23:22,302 --> 01:23:27,997
tell if it's yellow goo or just another puddle in
the swamp. I don't know, but you start to make

1367
01:23:27,997 --> 01:23:34,475
your way through. Weaving, you bang your shin, not
too painfully-- that's a metal table in there. You

1368
01:23:34,475 --> 01:23:40,266
start weaving your way through metal tables, and
you can, again, only from memory and the

1369
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:45,513
dimensions of these canyon walls, you're like, I
think that the commissary is over this way. You

1370
01:23:45,513 --> 01:23:55,674
start to make your way through there, and as Sam
is stepping, a snap. You step on something that

1371
01:23:55,674 --> 01:24:03,555
snaps like a twig, and you hear all around you,
rustling. And you're seeing,

1372
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:07,533
almost when you see a squirrel in the ivy or
something, the plants on the wall start shaking,

1373
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:14,346
and you see a flash of yellow fabric up on the
side (rustling sounds).

1374
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:17,221
LAURA: (gasps) Oh shit! Shit! I jump off of your
back and I take off running.

1375
01:24:17,221 --> 01:24:18,442
LIAM: Towards what?

1376
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:20,335
LAURA: Towards where I think the cafeteria is.

1377
01:24:20,335 --> 01:24:23,797
LIAM: Okay, make a perception check. Looking for
the door.

1378
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:25,019
SAM: You're stealing my dog?

1379
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:28,410
LAURA: Yep! I'm protecting your dog! A perception
check? Eight.

1380
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,177
LIAM: Plus anything?

1381
01:24:30,177 --> 01:24:31,429
LAURA: That is it.

1382
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:34,400
LIAM: You are wandering with a dog in your hand,
and you're like, "It's here."

1383
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,796
SAM: Laura, where are you going?

1384
01:24:36,796 --> 01:24:40,980
TRAVIS: I see my wife take off running, and I turn
around and I elbow Taliesin in the head, and I

1385
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,899
take off running after her!

1386
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:44,713
LIAM: All right, run and make a perception check.

1387
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:47,671
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay. Natural 20!

1388
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:51,367
TALIESIN: You're the fucking hunter.

1389
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:58,110
LIAM: You've got a brain like a steel trap. You
run past Laura, you hook her arm and drag her and

1390
01:24:58,110 --> 01:25:02,710
like a linebacker-- is that the right term in
football? Right towards the door, you know where

1391
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:08,958
that door is. You reach out and push through, and
you feel glass. Man-made glass, through all this

1392
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:10,364
leaves and shit.

1393
01:25:10,364 --> 01:25:12,960
TALIESIN: I'm running towards where they-- I'm
running after Travis.

1394
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,107
LIAM: Okay. You're going back in to be a hero?

1395
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:19,263
SAM: I am going to follow them. Quite quickly.

1396
01:25:19,263 --> 01:25:23,830
LIAM: All right. Everybody runs towards it. Travis
is motioning, going, "I've found it!" It's not

1397
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:27,241
everywhere, but up high near the tops of the
building, still (skittering sounds).

1398
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:29,682
LAURA: We're such pusses. Nobody wants to fight.

1399
01:25:29,682 --> 01:25:36,671
LIAM: There's a little bit of a moment, as vines
rip away, but you push in. And you guys are all

1400
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:39,757
inside a very, very dark room.

1401
01:25:39,757 --> 01:25:40,936
TRAVIS: You okay?

1402
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:42,088
LAURA: (hyperventilating) I'm okay.

1403
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:43,019
TRAVIS: Are you okay?

1404
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:43,949
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

1405
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:45,905
TRAVIS: Looks like you got hit in the head.

1406
01:25:45,905 --> 01:25:47,200
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1407
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,353
SAM: He just had tentacles shoot out of his arm.
He's fine.

1408
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:55,925
LIAM: You don't feel plant or anything, you feel
tile under your feet. It's pitch dark.

1409
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:57,318
LAURA: (whispers) Ashley?

1410
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,243
SAM: None of our phones are working anymore?

1411
01:25:59,243 --> 01:26:01,173
LAURA: Do we have a lighter? Do you have a
lighter?

1412
01:26:01,173 --> 01:26:05,898
TRAVIS: I do, in the bag. Yeah, I may have some
shorts in there or something. You want to light my

1413
01:26:05,898 --> 01:26:07,323
shorts on fire?

1414
01:26:07,323 --> 01:26:17,855
TALIESIN: Wait! Oh god. Oh, really? Oh god. Okay.
I'm opening up my bag and pulling out my very

1415
01:26:17,855 --> 01:26:23,475
expensive hardcover copy of The Wicked + The
Divine. And I'm tearing my least favorite pages

1416
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:25,927
and starting to roll them into a torch.

1417
01:26:25,927 --> 01:26:28,586
LAURA: Taliesin.

1418
01:26:28,586 --> 01:26:37,474
TALIESIN: If this is the last copy on Earth, I
will kill you! And I've made a bullshit torch out

1419
01:26:37,474 --> 01:26:38,902
of comic book paper.

1420
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,784
TRAVIS: All right. I light his thing.

1421
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:46,003
LIAM: You light the comic book page, and there's a
weak little sputter of light. And you look around,

1422
01:26:46,003 --> 01:26:50,959
and there's no plants in here. There is dust all
over everything. It is the commissary that you

1423
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:56,799
guys have had lunch in a million times. And the
fire burns down the page and burns down and goes

1424
01:26:56,799 --> 01:27:03,905
down and down, and just as it's about to go out,
another light source swells up from the center of

1425
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:09,720
the cafeteria, bright light-- you guys shield your
eyes. You can't see anything. It's so bright in

1426
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:15,639
here. You open your eyes, and between where the
tables are and the check-out counter is, is a

1427
01:27:15,639 --> 01:27:27,540
blue-gold glowing vision of a desk and a
flat-screen computer on it, and facing you, the

1428
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:35,708
way we are in this room, Ashley Johnson sits, in a
flannel and jeans. She sees you and says,

1429
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,562
"Oh hi, guys!"

1430
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:39,536
(laughter)

1431
01:27:39,536 --> 01:27:41,241
LIAM: "Oh, I miss you so much."

1432
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:42,897
LAURA: I miss you so much!

1433
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:44,446
SAM and TALIESIN: Where are you?

1434
01:27:44,446 --> 01:27:49,794
LIAM: "Oh, you know, I'm almost done. Season five
of Blindspot's almost done, and once it's done I'm

1435
01:27:49,794 --> 01:27:52,105
"coming home, and then I'm going to stay, okay?"

1436
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:54,188
TRAVIS: You're only on season two!

1437
01:27:54,188 --> 01:27:57,295
SAM: Wait, did we jump four years into the
future?

1438
01:27:57,295 --> 01:28:00,029
LAURA: Wait, this is it? What is going on? Is it
crazy up there?

1439
01:28:00,029 --> 01:28:02,873
LIAM: "Well, you know, the show is what it is."

1440
01:28:02,873 --> 01:28:06,943
SAM: Not with the show. Are there monsters
attacking you?

1441
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:09,437
LAURA: Does it look like Last of Us around you?

1442
01:28:09,437 --> 01:28:16,226
LIAM: She goes still for a second. And then
(electric sounds) lifts into the air, her arms out

1443
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:23,999
to the sides. She's transparent and beautiful,
white, feathered wings, translucent, shoot out

1444
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:30,845
from her side. She is an angel. Her hair is
floating backward. Her eyes are solid white. She

1445
01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:36,563
is staring past you. She doesn't see you, almost.
You can see through her. She's illuminated the

1446
01:28:36,563 --> 01:28:46,351
entire cafeteria, and a voice of power says,
"There's no time. The tower awaits. If you don't

1447
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:53,852
"make haste, the clock can never be turned back.
Only you. Yeah."

1448
01:28:53,852 --> 01:28:56,379
(laughter)

1449
01:28:56,379 --> 01:29:03,292
LIAM: And you are hit with a wave of golden light,
and you feel warmth travel up your entire body.

1450
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:13,162
All your wounds close. Your nipple heals. Your
headache is gone. The dog's hair grows back. You

1451
01:29:13,162 --> 01:29:15,758
all feel phenomenal.

1452
01:29:15,758 --> 01:29:17,403
LAURA: I give Bixby back to Sam.

1453
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:24,726
LIAM: You feel brave. You feel strong. You gain 25
hit points.

1454
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:26,755
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

1455
01:29:26,755 --> 01:29:28,348
LAURA: We're legit!

1456
01:29:28,348 --> 01:29:31,130
TRAVIS: Don't take my pencil!

1457
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:41,732
LIAM: She looks to each of you in turn. "I love
you guys. Go."

1458
01:29:41,732 --> 01:29:47,290
SAM: Was that a Snapchat filter? What was that?
How did she do that?

1459
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,943
LIAM: And that's where we'll take our break.

1460
01:29:48,943 --> 01:29:51,267
(shouting)

1461
01:29:51,267 --> 01:29:53,161
TRAVIS: You're killing it!

1462
01:29:53,161 --> 01:29:54,684
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

1463
01:29:54,684 --> 01:29:59,456
LAURA: This is so weird!

1464
01:29:59,456 --> 01:40:10,769
[break]

1465
01:40:10,808 --> 01:40:20,292
LIAM: Welcome back to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. We'll
jump back in the game in a second, but we just

1466
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:25,292
wanted to remind you that tickets for the CritRole
live show are up for sale; you can get them now.

1467
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:31,229
The link is in the chat. Also, just less than 24
hours to get the signed Joe Mad poster.

1468
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:32,907
SAM: Much less than 24 hours.

1469
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:34,448
LIAM: Much less. 12ish?

1470
01:40:34,448 --> 01:40:35,745
LAURA: Yeah, something around there.

1471
01:40:35,745 --> 01:40:42,219
LIAM: Something like that. 1:00 tomorrow Pacific
time. But I'm ready to go. Want to see where this

1472
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:43,179
is heading?

1473
01:40:43,179 --> 01:40:44,371
TRAVIS: Let's go!

1474
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,449
SAM: So we're in the cafeteria.

1475
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:53,626
LIAM: The light fades. You're standing in the
dark, and you feel-- (deep humming)

1476
01:40:53,626 --> 01:40:55,476
SAM: Oh no, the radiation again.

1477
01:40:55,476 --> 01:41:02,645
LIAM: Your brain hurts! It's numb, you can't
think! You're not inside anymore. You look around

1478
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:14,861
you. Wasteland. Total wasteland. The remains of a
few buildings, but not much. Scorched earth.

1479
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:22,399
Everything is ash and desolation. San Fernando
stretches for miles to the hills to the north, a

1480
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:28,503
vast valley of scorched earth and the odd fragment
of fallen civilization jutting up a few stories at

1481
01:41:28,503 --> 01:41:36,998
best. And behind you, the hills bordering what
probably once was Hollywood stand barren. Grim.

1482
01:41:36,998 --> 01:41:51,172
The only thing that dominates the landscape is the
tower. Gleaming. Almost like new. Like it were

1483
01:41:51,172 --> 01:42:02,932
built in 1927. The Warner Brothers water tower.
Standing above the waste. Rifts in the sky above

1484
01:42:02,932 --> 01:42:10,275
it tear open for a moment. (ripping) Vanish as
quickly as they come, every six or seven seconds.

1485
01:42:10,275 --> 01:42:13,379
Lightning storm around it.

1486
01:42:13,379 --> 01:42:26,150
And that's when you realize it. You've been here
before. Or maybe not here. Somewhere like here.

1487
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:38,804
Together. You four have adventured together
before, and you'll do it again. You've lived a

1488
01:42:38,804 --> 01:42:44,749
thousand lives before this together. You'll live a
thousand more after this. You're living a thousand

1489
01:42:44,749 --> 01:42:47,502
lives right now in other worlds.

1490
01:42:47,502 --> 01:42:49,730
[dramatic music]

1491
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:56,357
You know that you
are linked and have been throughout eternity. The

1492
01:42:56,357 --> 01:43:02,993
tower stands in the distance. What would you like
to do?

1493
01:43:02,993 --> 01:43:04,860
SAM: Ashley said to go to the tower.

1494
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:06,754
LAURA: We have to turn back the clock!

1495
01:43:06,754 --> 01:43:10,979
TRAVIS: Sam, I told you to tell your wife to
conserve water during her showers!

1496
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:14,101
SAM: She tried! She took military showers!

1497
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:17,214
TRAVIS: Jesus! There's nothing left, man!

1498
01:43:17,214 --> 01:43:21,562
TALIESIN: I always thought there was something
really fucked up about that Animaniacs cartoon. I

1499
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:23,414
think we need to deal with this shit.

1500
01:43:23,414 --> 01:43:26,773
LIAM: There's no buildings between you and it now.
It is just a field--

1501
01:43:26,773 --> 01:43:29,316
TRAVIS: Same tall grass?

1502
01:43:29,316 --> 01:43:33,910
LIAM: No, just brown scorched dead earth.

1503
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:37,519
LAURA: Can we see anything moving, anything other
than the tower?

1504
01:43:37,519 --> 01:43:45,417
LIAM: As you get closer to it, you do see
something. You see patches of yellow all along the

1505
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:46,914
legs of the tower.

1506
01:43:46,914 --> 01:43:49,062
LAURA: Oh, is it that goop? Sky goop?

1507
01:43:49,062 --> 01:44:00,630
LIAM: You see Liams glued, Geiger-like, all over
the legs of the tower, some sort of mucus-like

1508
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:06,932
membrane over them, holding them in place. They're
also not-- Liam's about 5'11", that you remember.

1509
01:44:06,932 --> 01:44:09,031
These are about four feet?

1510
01:44:09,031 --> 01:44:14,904
SAM: Maybe they're not fully formed yet? Maybe
this is where they're born!

1511
01:44:14,904 --> 01:44:20,538
LIAM: Electricity courses through the metal of the
tower, into them. (electricity sounds) Back out

1512
01:44:20,538 --> 01:44:24,093
again. All through the legs. The whole thing is
charged.

1513
01:44:24,093 --> 01:44:29,139
SAM: Wait, was Liam ever Liam?

1514
01:44:29,139 --> 01:44:32,420
TRAVIS: We need some of the happy slime from
Ghostbusters II.

1515
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:41,145
LIAM: And above, now that you're closer, you couldn't
see it before, in the sky, circling the peak of the tower,

1516
01:44:41,145 --> 01:44:49,460
you see a gaunt, corpse-like steed, a horse of the
apocalypse, leaving a trail of fire behind it as

1517
01:44:49,460 --> 01:45:04,418
it circles the tower. On it rides a shriveled corpse
with red hair straggling behind it. And as you

1518
01:45:04,418 --> 01:45:14,746
draw even closer, it hits you. There is no
mistaking that thin, towering frame. That is

1519
01:45:14,746 --> 01:45:16,497
fucking Conan O'Brien.

1520
01:45:16,497 --> 01:45:20,412
(laughter)

1521
01:45:20,412 --> 01:45:23,306
LIAM: I mean, he films right on the lot!

1522
01:45:23,355 --> 01:45:25,390
SAM: It's dead Conan O'Brien?

1523
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:27,227
LIAM: He is moving!

1524
01:45:27,227 --> 01:45:29,308
LAURA: Riding the horse?

1525
01:45:29,308 --> 01:45:35,287
LIAM: All that's left on the bottom is a skeletal
jaw. The flesh stops here, but that signature

1526
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:39,324
pompadour is a little ragged, but it's still
there.

1527
01:45:39,324 --> 01:45:41,640
TRAVIS: He's like 6'5". This will be a foe.

1528
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,783
LAURA: This is serious.

1529
01:45:43,783 --> 01:45:53,557
LIAM: The horse lands with a (clang) on the top of
the water tower. The horse shrieks. It's

1530
01:45:53,557 --> 01:45:58,888
terrifying. Fills your ears, and the O'Brien
lich--

1531
01:45:58,888 --> 01:46:02,036
SAM: Oh, it's Liam O'Brien and Conan O'Brien!

1532
01:46:02,036 --> 01:46:08,352
TALIESIN: It's the fucking O'Briens!

1533
01:46:08,352 --> 01:46:13,741
LIAM: And the tower pulses the entire thing with a
greenish-yellow light, like radiation, and you see

1534
01:46:13,741 --> 01:46:21,315
the Liams, the small Liams on the legs start to
jitter and jive on there and (squelching) and in

1535
01:46:21,315 --> 01:46:25,489
four or five places, another Liam fires out of a
Liam and another Liam fires out of a Liam--

1536
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:27,687
LAURA: Are they even smaller than the previous
ones?

1537
01:46:27,687 --> 01:46:29,362
LIAM: Hard to tell.

1538
01:46:29,362 --> 01:46:32,610
LAURA: Oh no! I don't want to kill Liam!

1539
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:36,362
LIAM: Here is your water tower.

1540
01:46:36,362 --> 01:46:45,583
SAM: What are those things down there? Is that
wreckage?

1541
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:51,855
LIAM: Husks of cars. Husks of buildings. Oh dear!

1542
01:46:51,855 --> 01:46:54,332
SAM: Do they make a Conan mini?

1543
01:46:54,332 --> 01:47:03,259
LIAM: They do not make a Conan mini. He's sitting
up here. And there are also not maniac Liam

1544
01:47:03,259 --> 01:47:04,418
figures.

1545
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:10,440
LAURA: So wait, the Conan lich, O'Brien lich
landed on top of the water tower?

1546
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:14,120
LIAM: He's standing on top. He's on the horse on
the tower.

1547
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:17,404
LAURA: Oh jeez.

1548
01:47:17,404 --> 01:47:29,045
SAM: I turn to Travis and say, dude, are you
making one-and-a-half scale? Just tell me. Is it

1549
01:47:29,045 --> 01:47:31,143
close to what I'm getting?

1550
01:47:31,143 --> 01:47:33,173
TRAVIS: Bro. I mean.

1551
01:47:33,173 --> 01:47:38,166
SAM: It's higher than that? Can you talk to
somebody about it for me?

1552
01:47:38,166 --> 01:47:41,220
TRAVIS: I mean, I guess so. Why don't you switch
agencies?

1553
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,958
TALIESIN: What's your agent doing for you, man?

1554
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:45,472
SAM: All right, let's go kill this thing.

1555
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:49,018
LIAM: Roll for initiative, please.

1556
01:47:49,018 --> 01:47:52,091
SAM: Does it see us? Are we stealthing?

1557
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:56,809
LIAM: It's staring at you as you walk up.

1558
01:47:56,809 --> 01:47:58,612
TALIESIN: Yes!

1559
01:47:58,612 --> 01:48:06,985
LIAM: 25 to 20? 15 to 20? What? Ten to 15?

1560
01:48:06,985 --> 01:48:14,682
LAURA: 13? Oh no!

1561
01:48:14,682 --> 01:48:16,827
TALIESIN: Oh, 14!

1562
01:48:16,827 --> 01:48:18,102
SAM: Oh, okay.

1563
01:48:18,102 --> 01:48:19,521
TALIESIN: I was reading.

1564
01:48:19,521 --> 01:48:21,506
LIAM: Okay. Under 13?

1565
01:48:21,506 --> 01:48:22,510
SAM: Eight.

1566
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:24,211
TRAVIS: Nine.

1567
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:25,867
LIAM: What did Bixby roll?

1568
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:27,728
SAM: Bixby takes my initiative.

1569
01:48:27,728 --> 01:48:42,483
LIAM: Oh, your initiative. Thank you. I knew that,
obviously. Who got the nine? Travis. Okay. The

1570
01:48:42,483 --> 01:48:52,738
lich kicks the sides of this nightmare steed's
broken ribs and goes, "Ooh!" and the horse takes

1571
01:48:52,738 --> 01:48:58,301
off to the sky and flies a little closer.

1572
01:48:58,301 --> 01:49:02,342
LAURA: Oh no! Seriously, we are going to die. This
is a lot.

1573
01:49:02,342 --> 01:49:07,108
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself. I've been training my
whole life for this.

1574
01:49:07,108 --> 01:49:08,710
LIAM: And now it is Taliesin's turn.

1575
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:09,743
SAM: Oh boy.

1576
01:49:09,743 --> 01:49:10,972
LAURA: Go, Taliesin!

1577
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:12,900
TRAVIS: Come on, tentacle dick motherfucker!

1578
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:17,086
TALIESIN: I am going to cast--

1579
01:49:17,086 --> 01:49:21,104
SAM: Cast?! Taliesin, what are you talking about?

1580
01:49:21,104 --> 01:49:24,356
TALIESIN: I had an epiphany! I had a fucking
epiphany.

1581
01:49:24,356 --> 01:49:26,197
SAM: But that thing's magic.

1582
01:49:26,197 --> 01:49:30,918
LIAM: Given by angelic Ashley and the DM.

1583
01:49:30,918 --> 01:49:37,553
TALIESIN: And I cast Chill Touch on Conan O'Brien.
Chill, motherfucker!

1584
01:49:37,553 --> 01:49:39,290
LIAM: Roll to attack.

1585
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:41,309
SAM: You're a voice actor.

1586
01:49:41,309 --> 01:49:45,932
LAURA: He's a warlock. Let's be honest.

1587
01:49:45,932 --> 01:49:54,701
TALIESIN: I also have some basic massage, and this
is coming into play. (counts quietly) 20!

1588
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:59,491
LIAM: 20? That hits!

1589
01:49:59,491 --> 01:50:02,754
LAURA: I hope so. We're level one!

1590
01:50:02,754 --> 01:50:11,683
TALIESIN: On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic,
which is seven, and can't regain hit points until

1591
01:50:11,683 --> 01:50:19,657
the start of my next turn, and is he undead? He
has disadvantage on all of his attack rolls until

1592
01:50:19,657 --> 01:50:26,037
the end of my next turn. I do that, and then I run
behind Travis.

1593
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:29,351
LAURA: I'm already hiding there.

1594
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:31,024
TALIESIN: I run behind Laura.

1595
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:32,472
LIAM: Laura, it is your turn.

1596
01:50:32,472 --> 01:50:36,243
LAURA: Okay. Oh no. Am I hidden behind Travis?

1597
01:50:36,243 --> 01:50:43,057
LIAM: No. You're over here by this husked-out car.
He's there. Taliesin is taking up your hiding

1598
01:50:43,057 --> 01:50:44,266
spot.

1599
01:50:44,266 --> 01:50:46,463
LAURA: And Liams are just wandering around?

1600
01:50:46,463 --> 01:50:48,954
LIAM: Their eyes are on you. They're coming.

1601
01:50:48,954 --> 01:50:56,877
LAURA: Can I duck behind the husk of the car that
I'm at? No? Is it hideable?

1602
01:50:56,877 --> 01:51:03,592
LIAM: I'll allow it at disadvantage, because
they're dumb as sticks but they're looking this

1603
01:51:03,592 --> 01:51:04,701
way.

1604
01:51:04,701 --> 01:51:08,134
LAURA: I'm just going to duck a little bit, and
I'm going to hold my turn--

1605
01:51:08,134 --> 01:51:12,516
LIAM: Roll for stealth at disadvantage.

1606
01:51:12,516 --> 01:51:17,452
TRAVIS: You could only do one worse. Same roll!

1607
01:51:17,452 --> 01:51:25,678
LAURA: Wil Wheaton's dice is out of the game! It
was a nine that I rolled, technically.

1608
01:51:25,678 --> 01:51:34,311
LIAM: Yeah, that didn't work. You duck behind a
car that has no walls or anything. They're looking

1609
01:51:34,311 --> 01:51:35,878
right through.

1610
01:51:35,878 --> 01:51:42,339
LAURA: And I'm going to hold my turn until one of
them is standing next to one of our people.

1611
01:51:42,339 --> 01:51:45,233
LIAM: Understood. Okay. Travis, you're up.

1612
01:51:45,233 --> 01:51:54,099
TRAVIS: I fear no creature, and I would like to
use my full movement to rush towards the nearest

1613
01:51:54,099 --> 01:51:57,530
foe. Whatever's closest.

1614
01:51:57,530 --> 01:52:04,590
LIAM: I would say it's this crouching Liam right
here. (heavy footstep sounds)

1615
01:52:04,590 --> 01:52:09,977
TRAVIS: Lemur, come here you little motherfucker!
And I take the giant maniac sword and I'm going to

1616
01:52:09,977 --> 01:52:12,751
swing it in a downward arc at it.

1617
01:52:12,751 --> 01:52:16,106
LIAM: Oh, full movement for you is six, right?

1618
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:18,250
LAURA: Oh, you hasted to get to him?

1619
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:23,157
LIAM: I'll reverse time. You can either go as far
as you can go, or you can use all your movement to

1620
01:52:23,157 --> 01:52:24,240
go up.

1621
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:27,080
TRAVIS: I'm going to use all my movement to go up
and glare.

1622
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:30,612
LAURA: The minute he gets there I'm going to
dagger! Do I get two daggers or just one dagger?

1623
01:52:30,612 --> 01:52:31,704
LIAM: Just one dagger.

1624
01:52:31,704 --> 01:52:33,621
LAURA: Just one dagger I throw at this Liam.

1625
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:35,569
LIAM: Okay. Roll to attack.

1626
01:52:35,569 --> 01:52:40,174
LAURA: Okay. Ten!

1627
01:52:40,174 --> 01:52:46,341
LIAM: Oh, got to flip the page, sorry. (whoosh)

1628
01:52:46,341 --> 01:52:47,676
LAURA: Oh, come on!

1629
01:52:47,676 --> 01:52:51,427
LIAM: Flies past his head. Sam, you're up.

1630
01:52:51,427 --> 01:52:54,073
SAM: How many daggers do you have left?

1631
01:52:54,073 --> 01:52:56,239
LAURA: I only have two daggers! I got to go find
that other dagger!

1632
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:59,607
SAM: I tell the pug to go find that dagger.

1633
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:05,486
LIAM: (barks)

1634
01:53:05,486 --> 01:53:09,872
SAM: And then I will turn. Do I have a shot at
Travis's Liam?

1635
01:53:09,872 --> 01:53:15,047
LIAM: I'm going to play fast and loose with the
pug and I'll let you take a couple steps to the

1636
01:53:15,047 --> 01:53:16,966
side to get a clear shot.

1637
01:53:16,966 --> 01:53:25,635
SAM: Okay, I'll take a couple steps, nock my
arrow, and say, watch your backs! Travis, watch

1638
01:53:25,635 --> 01:53:37,595
your six! That's what they say in games. And I'll
turn the bow like this, sideways. And I'll fire!

1639
01:53:37,595 --> 01:53:42,817
Pug life. 16, that's a 20.

1640
01:53:42,817 --> 01:53:45,247
LIAM: Hits. Roll for damage.

1641
01:53:45,247 --> 01:53:46,449
SAM: What do I roll?

1642
01:53:46,449 --> 01:53:48,315
LAURA: You're getting so good at this bow!

1643
01:53:48,315 --> 01:53:50,152
SAM: It just says plus two.

1644
01:53:50,152 --> 01:53:51,952
TALIESIN: 1d8 plus two.

1645
01:53:51,952 --> 01:53:54,642
SAM: Seven.

1646
01:53:54,642 --> 01:54:02,131
LIAM: Seven. The arrow shoots and goes straight
into Liam's eye. (death rattle) And it looks up at

1647
01:54:02,131 --> 01:54:04,740
you, Travis, and goes, "Buddy."

1648
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:07,008
ALL: No!

1649
01:54:07,008 --> 01:54:08,736
TRAVIS: A sliver of humanity!

1650
01:54:08,736 --> 01:54:10,697
SAM: You didn't get a shot at him. I'm sorry,
buddy!

1651
01:54:10,697 --> 01:54:14,581
LAURA: We shouldn't kill him! We should kill the
big old Conan!

1652
01:54:14,581 --> 01:54:16,519
SAM: But these are fun.

1653
01:54:16,519 --> 01:54:23,009
TALIESIN: You take the ground O'Briens. We'll deal
with the flying O'Brien. Everything will be fine.

1654
01:54:23,009 --> 01:54:27,362
Oh no. They're quick.

1655
01:54:27,362 --> 01:54:29,524
LAURA: Oh shit, they can run really far.

1656
01:54:29,524 --> 01:54:40,289
LIAM: Yes, they do actually. Sorry. All right. One
Liam attacks ranger Sam.

1657
01:54:40,289 --> 01:54:41,915
SAM: Oh no.

1658
01:54:41,915 --> 01:54:44,501
LIAM: What's your armor class?

1659
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:45,686
SAM: 12.

1660
01:54:45,686 --> 01:54:48,503
LIAM: You just go, "oh Jesus!" And he misses
entirely.

1661
01:54:48,503 --> 01:54:51,885
SAM: I know Liam too well! I know all of his
moves!

1662
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,009
LIAM: What's your armor class?

1663
01:54:54,009 --> 01:54:54,828
TRAVS: 12.

1664
01:54:54,828 --> 01:55:01,063
LIAM: Yeah, these things are not that strong. So
you just go, hey, buddy! And he smashes into the

1665
01:55:01,063 --> 01:55:16,589
ground. Now it is this fellow's turn. He gets
closer. "Shazbot!"

1666
01:55:16,589 --> 01:55:19,190
LAURA: What did he say? Shazbot?

1667
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:22,978
LIAM: You fall to the ground, stunned.

1668
01:55:22,978 --> 01:55:25,291
SAM: No save, no nothing?

1669
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:29,438
LIAM: Nope. You can't move, you can't think, you
can't do shit.

1670
01:55:29,438 --> 01:55:30,758
LAURA: Travis!

1671
01:55:30,758 --> 01:55:34,321
LIAM: Taliesin, you're up.

1672
01:55:34,321 --> 01:55:42,752
TALIESIN: Oh wow. I'm going to run towards Travis.
I have my movement, whatever my movement is.

1673
01:55:42,752 --> 01:55:47,580
LAURA: Taliesin, help him!

1674
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:52,885
TALIESIN: As a bonus action, I'm going to give him
some Advil and give him a slap across the face,

1675
01:55:52,885 --> 01:55:58,792
and then for my main action, I'm going to Chill
Touch the Liam in front of me.

1676
01:55:58,792 --> 01:56:01,349
LIAM: Okay. Roll to attack.

1677
01:56:01,349 --> 01:56:03,518
TALIESIN: Come on, motherfucker.

1678
01:56:03,518 --> 01:56:05,653
TRAVIS: Wait, did Conan cast that on me?

1679
01:56:05,653 --> 01:56:07,283
TALIESIN: 18.

1680
01:56:07,283 --> 01:56:08,734
LIAM: Hits.

1681
01:56:08,734 --> 01:56:16,897
TALIESIN: And that's eight points of damage,
necrotic.

1682
01:56:16,897 --> 01:56:22,216
LIAM: The tentacle goes (whoosh) slides around
Liam's neck like a necktie, and his whole head

1683
01:56:22,216 --> 01:56:28,650
freezes, breaks, and he's gone.

1684
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:34,139
TALIESIN: And then Advil and slapping for my bonus
action.

1685
01:56:34,139 --> 01:56:37,157
LIAM: Travis, make a constitution save right now.

1686
01:56:37,157 --> 01:56:39,625
SAM: With Advil-tage.

1687
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:43,878
TRAVIS: 19. Stop slapping me!

1688
01:56:43,878 --> 01:56:45,462
TALIESIN: Not yet!

1689
01:56:45,462 --> 01:56:53,414
LIAM: Your turn is gone, but you came out if it.
You look up in the sky, and you see that red

1690
01:56:53,414 --> 01:56:55,711
haired motherfucker go, "Meh."

1691
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:58,140
TRAVIS: Damn wildling. We've got to kill him.

1692
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:01,259
LIAM: Sam, you're up.

1693
01:57:01,259 --> 01:57:05,736
SAM: How's the pug doing? Is he getting closer to
the knife?

1694
01:57:05,736 --> 01:57:08,279
LIAM: That's where he is. That's where you see
him.

1695
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:13,308
SAM: Great. There's a guy right next to me, isn't
there?

1696
01:57:13,308 --> 01:57:16,395
LIAM: Yeah, he's in your face, and if you try to
fire at him with your bow--

1697
01:57:16,395 --> 01:57:18,200
LAURA: Wait, I didn't get to go!

1698
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,484
LIAM: Where are you on that list? Oh, it's because
my writing sucks, so why don't you go now?

1699
01:57:21,484 --> 01:57:27,930
LAURA: I'm going to run up. Am I close enough that
I can attack the thing attacking Sam? I go,

1700
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:32,468
Travis are you okay?

1701
01:57:32,468 --> 01:57:34,208
TRAVIS: (yells) Stop hitting me!

1702
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:35,682
LAURA: Stop hitting him!

1703
01:57:35,682 --> 01:57:36,678
TALIESIN: Say please!

1704
01:57:36,678 --> 01:57:37,961
TRAVIS: Please!

1705
01:57:37,961 --> 01:57:42,265
LIAM: You can get close enough to throw. Not sneak
attack, obviously, but go for it.

1706
01:57:42,265 --> 01:57:44,000
LAURA: But he's flanked.

1707
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,807
SAM: Yeah, he's flanked by an ally. This is the
thing you try to pull all the time.

1708
01:57:47,807 --> 01:57:55,024
LIAM: Is it a surprise, or is it a crit? I get
quadruple damage?

1709
01:57:55,071 --> 01:57:57,038
TRAVIS: Automatic crit with quadruple damage?

1710
01:57:57,038 --> 01:57:59,867
LIAM: I just want you to fail, Laura. That's all.

1711
01:57:59,867 --> 01:58:18,355
LAURA: Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a 24. Four. Five. 23! Everything.
All at once. (laughs) Damn it. That's good. Nine.

1712
01:58:18,355 --> 01:58:24,871
LIAM: It sinks (knife sound effect) right into his
sternum. (death rattle) "Twinnie!"

1713
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:26,021
LAURA: Oh no...

1714
01:58:26,021 --> 01:58:28,240
TRAVIS: Twin! Twinnie!

1715
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:32,494
LAURA: But the dagger was still there in his body,
right?

1716
01:58:32,494 --> 01:58:35,062
LIAM: Yeah, I just took the player off. It's
sticking straight out.

1717
01:58:35,062 --> 01:58:36,995
LAURA: I'm sorry, Liam. I need my dagger back!

1718
01:58:36,995 --> 01:58:39,805
LIAM: Okay, now it's Sam's turn.

1719
01:58:39,805 --> 01:58:44,229
SAM: Okay, I'll lean down and grab the dagger.
Flick it to Laura.

1720
01:58:44,229 --> 01:58:45,553
LAURA: Oh no.

1721
01:58:45,553 --> 01:58:47,509
LIAM: Make a dexterity check.

1722
01:58:47,509 --> 01:58:54,928
LAURA: Oh jeez. Catch it. Oh, that's fine. That's a
dexterity?

1723
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:56,074
LIAM: Yeah.

1724
01:58:56,074 --> 01:58:58,627
LAURA: 23.

1725
01:58:58,627 --> 01:59:05,358
LIAM: I'm sorry, you take eight points of-- you're
good. All right, I'll call that a freebie. And now

1726
01:59:05,358 --> 01:59:06,504
what?

1727
01:59:06,504 --> 01:59:17,227
SAM: And then I'll look up to Conan O'Brien, and
I'll draw my bow and arrow, and I'll look for that

1728
01:59:17,227 --> 01:59:21,033
red mane of hair. I'll just fire one straight at
it.

1729
01:59:21,033 --> 01:59:22,399
LIAM: Go for it.

1730
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:27,574
SAM: Yes! That is a 23!

1731
01:59:27,574 --> 01:59:29,503
LIAM: Hits!

1732
01:59:29,503 --> 01:59:34,173
SAM: Oh, it's an eight, plus two is ten points of
damage!

1733
01:59:34,173 --> 01:59:42,422
LIAM: All right, definitely hits. He (hisses)
breaks it off and lets it fall to the ground.

1734
01:59:42,422 --> 01:59:46,787
SAM: You're a hack, Conan, a hack! Your best days
are behind you!

1735
01:59:46,787 --> 01:59:48,358
LIAM: Lich's turn.

1736
01:59:48,358 --> 01:59:50,509
TALIESIN: This is the funniest he's ever been,
really.

1737
01:59:50,509 --> 01:59:55,183
LIAM: Oh man. He points at you.

1738
01:59:55,183 --> 01:59:58,467
TRAVIS: Yeah, he heard your words!

1739
01:59:58,467 --> 02:00:02,790
SAM: Bixby, throw your body in front of it!

1740
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:08,675
LIAM: Hold on, this is where the cracks show! I
don't remember the spell! Shit. Hold on.

1741
02:00:08,675 --> 02:00:10,242
TRAVIS: He's pulling up the app!

1742
02:00:10,242 --> 02:00:11,585
LIAM: I'm pulling up the app!

1743
02:00:11,585 --> 02:00:13,752
SAM: I've got some good spells, just ask me!

1744
02:00:13,752 --> 02:00:15,965
LAURA: Is Conan a bard?

1745
02:00:15,965 --> 02:00:17,474
SAM: Oh shit. Maybe he is.

1746
02:00:17,474 --> 02:00:20,943
TALIESIN: Conan O'Barden. That's not very good.

1747
02:00:20,943 --> 02:00:28,690
LIAM: Oh man. He points at you, and a swirl of
white icy cloud forms around his hand and shoots

1748
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:37,371
right at you! (spell firing) Right past your
shoulder, strikes the ground behind you. Did I get

1749
02:00:37,371 --> 02:00:40,868
that right? Yep! Missed you!

1750
02:00:40,868 --> 02:00:44,014
SAM: How do you know it missed? I didn't roll or
anything.

1751
02:00:44,014 --> 02:00:45,216
LIAM: I rolled.

1752
02:00:45,216 --> 02:00:46,522
TALIESIN: It's magic.

1753
02:00:46,522 --> 02:00:48,699
SAM: Okay! Nice.

1754
02:00:48,699 --> 02:00:53,154
LIAM: Okay, now it is Taliesin's turn.

1755
02:00:53,154 --> 02:00:55,858
TALIESIN: All right, you're fine. I've stopped
slapping you.

1756
02:00:55,858 --> 02:00:58,366
TRAVIS: Thank you!

1757
02:00:58,366 --> 02:01:13,390
TALIESIN: Where am I? Oh. there I am. I'm going to
get away from Travis, and head back a little, back

1758
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:17,856
towards the main group, and I'm going to cast Mage
Hand.

1759
02:01:17,856 --> 02:01:18,989
LIAM: Here, you think?

1760
02:01:18,989 --> 02:01:26,462
TALIESIN: About there. And I'm going to cast Mage
Hand. Can I make it do things when I want to cast

1761
02:01:26,462 --> 02:01:28,856
it, or is it not until next turn that I can make
it?

1762
02:01:28,856 --> 02:01:30,434
LIAM: I'll say you can make it do things.

1763
02:01:30,434 --> 02:01:34,475
TALIESIN: I'm going to have it start retrieving
the other dagger for Laura.

1764
02:01:34,475 --> 02:01:42,497
LIAM: Okay, the dagger floats up in the air, Bixby
chasing after it (barks). And goes right to your

1765
02:01:42,497 --> 02:01:43,577
hand.

1766
02:01:43,577 --> 02:01:45,143
SAM: Sorry Bixby.

1767
02:01:45,143 --> 02:01:52,904
LIAM: And you see just traces of octopus tentacles
in your vision for a second, but it's gone. Maybe

1768
02:01:52,904 --> 02:01:56,576
you imagined it. Travis you're up!

1769
02:01:56,576 --> 02:02:00,581
TRAVIS: I stand up from being stunned.

1770
02:02:00,581 --> 02:02:04,453
LIAM: Yep. (bloop) You got three more squares
left.

1771
02:02:04,453 --> 02:02:07,335
TRAVIS: How high in the air is Conan?

1772
02:02:07,335 --> 02:02:11,951
LIAM: (laughing) About 50, 55 feet away.

1773
02:02:11,951 --> 02:02:17,059
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay. Can I run directly
underneath him? And I'm going to take the sword

1774
02:02:17,059 --> 02:02:20,629
and go (panting, grunt).

1775
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:22,446
SAM: Just throw the sword?

1776
02:02:22,446 --> 02:02:26,200
LIAM: Roll and pray for not one!

1777
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,506
TRAVIS: 14!

1778
02:02:28,506 --> 02:02:36,585
LIAM: The sword flies up, (spinning sounds) 15
feet too low, and comes back down--

1779
02:02:36,585 --> 02:02:39,410
TRAVIS: It doesn't hit me though, right?

1780
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:44,337
LIAM: No, it doesn't. It's five feet away from
you. Sam, what would you like to do now?

1781
02:02:44,337 --> 02:02:46,876
SAM: Wait, oh. Are there no more O'Briens?

1782
02:02:46,876 --> 02:02:51,153
LIAM: Wait! Did I skip you again? I did, because I
wrote your name--

1783
02:02:51,153 --> 02:02:54,070
SAM: But wait, are there bad guys that haven't
gone?

1784
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:56,209
LIAM: Liam, Liam, two Liams on the ground.

1785
02:02:56,209 --> 02:02:58,110
SAM: They haven't had turns in a while.

1786
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:59,833
LIAM: Oh, you're right, thank you! Awesome!

1787
02:02:59,833 --> 02:03:01,583
LAURA: Oh, Sam!

1788
02:03:01,583 --> 02:03:08,817
LIAM: What's your AC, Sam?

1789
02:03:08,817 --> 02:03:10,101
SAM: 12.

1790
02:03:10,101 --> 02:03:12,288
LIAM: Oh, it doesn't matter. Taliesin and Travis
what are your ACs?

1791
02:03:12,288 --> 02:03:13,303
TRAVIS: 12.

1792
02:03:13,303 --> 02:03:14,250
TALIESIN: 11.

1793
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:27,480
LIAM: Okay. You both get hit. Liam slashes at your
chest, Travis, for two points of damage! He leaves

1794
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,547
a raking claw down. That nipple that healed is cut
again.

1795
02:03:30,547 --> 02:03:31,751
TRAVIS: Bitch!

1796
02:03:31,751 --> 02:03:42,306
LIAM: Misses you, though, Taliesin. He saw the
black energy swirling around your arms, and

1797
02:03:42,306 --> 02:03:45,002
(gibbers).

1798
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:48,407
LAURA: Liam sounds like Gollum!

1799
02:03:48,407 --> 02:03:52,115
LIAM: I've lost my track. Laura.

1800
02:03:52,115 --> 02:03:59,192
LAURA: I'm up! I guess I'm going to run up, and
can I attack one of the Liams? The Liam that's

1801
02:03:59,192 --> 02:04:02,520
attacking Travis? I'm going to protect my
husband!

1802
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:06,155
LIAM: Okay. All right, you're there.

1803
02:04:06,155 --> 02:04:09,229
LAURA: I'm going to jump on Liam's back and stab
down!

1804
02:04:09,229 --> 02:04:12,673
LIAM: Okay. Roll to attack. This hurts me, Laura.

1805
02:04:12,673 --> 02:04:16,881
LAURA: (laughing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother!
15?

1806
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:18,751
LIAM: 15 hits.

1807
02:04:18,751 --> 02:04:25,305
LAURA: Oh, good! (laughs) Nine.

1808
02:04:25,305 --> 02:04:35,865
LIAM: You sink it into his back and drag it down
his shoulder. (death rattle) He dies.

1809
02:04:35,865 --> 02:04:38,016
LAURA: That is so terrible.

1810
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,488
TRAVIS: How many more Liams are there?

1811
02:04:39,488 --> 02:04:41,113
LAURA: Should we not kill these Liams?

1812
02:04:41,113 --> 02:04:43,511
TALIESIN: We should totally kill these Liams.

1813
02:04:43,511 --> 02:04:52,116
LIAM: Sam, you're up. Think I got a little
bollixed in my lineup, but I think you're up now.

1814
02:04:52,116 --> 02:04:59,706
SAM: Okay. Let's see. Do I have a clear shot at
the last-- is there one remaining Liam?

1815
02:04:59,706 --> 02:05:02,320
LIAM: Yeah, right here by Taliesin.

1816
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:09,365
SAM: Okay. I'll scoot over a couple paces.
Actually no. Sorry. I won't shoot at that one

1817
02:05:09,365 --> 02:05:15,136
because I got to leave something for you guys to
do. I'll shoot at Conan again.

1818
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:21,697
LIAM: Conan? (counting) Yeah, you're good.

1819
02:05:21,697 --> 02:05:27,110
SAM: So I will fire another one right at Conan.

1820
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:28,142
LIAM: Go for it.

1821
02:05:28,142 --> 02:05:33,599
SAM: All right. Okay! 17.

1822
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:35,631
LIAM: 17 does hit.

1823
02:05:35,631 --> 02:05:39,538
(impressed noises)

1824
02:05:39,538 --> 02:05:44,291
SAM: In your face. Another eight plus two is ten!

1825
02:05:44,291 --> 02:05:49,527
LIAM: All right. It sinks between two ribs and
hangs there. He doesn't pay much attention to it.

1826
02:05:49,527 --> 02:06:01,874
This one sees Laura distracted with her kill and
lashes out and tries to bite into your ribs, and

1827
02:06:01,874 --> 02:06:07,520
it does bite into your ribs. You feel Liam
O'Brien's teeth sink in and take a bite out of

1828
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:10,061
your side. One hit point of damage.

1829
02:06:10,061 --> 02:06:11,281
SAM: One?

1830
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:12,903
TRAVIS: One hit point.

1831
02:06:12,903 --> 02:06:20,947
LIAM: The lich flies closer to you still, Sam.
Points at you again.

1832
02:06:20,947 --> 02:06:23,965
SAM: Finger of Death.

1833
02:06:23,965 --> 02:06:25,750
LIAM: No.

1834
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:29,525
TRAVIS: Instantaneous.

1835
02:06:29,525 --> 02:06:33,989
SAM: He loves casting spells. He knows how to do
it well.

1836
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:35,838
LIAM: Love spells. Love them.

1837
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:37,492
LAURA: Can we open all of these packets?

1838
02:06:37,492 --> 02:06:39,265
SAM: Yeah, I bought them for you guys! What's
that one?

1839
02:06:39,265 --> 02:06:42,172
LAURA: This is the strawberry taffy. Do you want
some of it?

1840
02:06:42,172 --> 02:06:43,852
SAM: No, I'm so curious!

1841
02:06:43,852 --> 02:06:45,615
LAURA: There's some Zagnut left.

1842
02:06:45,615 --> 02:06:47,609
SAM: I'll take a bite of Zagnut.

1843
02:06:47,609 --> 02:06:52,115
LIAM: He points at you again, and that ice flies
out of his hand again. This time hits you

1844
02:06:52,115 --> 02:06:58,033
full-force. You feel sleet and ice covering your
entire body. The whole front of your body starts

1845
02:06:58,033 --> 02:07:02,374
to freeze and burn. You take 25 hit points of
damage.

1846
02:07:02,374 --> 02:07:04,493
LAURA: 25?!

1847
02:07:04,493 --> 02:07:06,193
SAM: No save?

1848
02:07:06,193 --> 02:07:07,379
LIAM: No.

1849
02:07:07,379 --> 02:07:14,014
SAM: I can't halve it with some sort of
constitution save or something? It just happens.

1850
02:07:14,014 --> 02:07:16,180
TALIESIN: We have lots of Advil.

1851
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:18,922
LIAM: Ranged, just like an arrow. So where're you
at?

1852
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:23,418
SAM: I'm now where I was before I got the 25 hit
point boost. 11.

1853
02:07:23,418 --> 02:07:27,656
LIAM: You are slow-moving, too. You are reduced in
speed.

1854
02:07:27,656 --> 02:07:31,325
SAM: Damn. You're going to pay for that, Conan
O'Brien.

1855
02:07:31,325 --> 02:07:34,152
LAURA: I think I've got some Neosporin in my purse.

1856
02:07:34,192 --> 02:07:37,694
TALIESIN: Can I send my Mage Hand up there?

1857
02:07:37,694 --> 02:07:41,450
SAM: It has a range of 30.

1858
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:46,271
LAURA: What about your tentacles? Can you grasp
his leg with the tentacles?

1859
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:49,074
TALIESIN: Oh shit. He's not 30, is he?

1860
02:07:49,074 --> 02:07:49,979
LIAM: 40.

1861
02:07:49,979 --> 02:07:51,810
TALIESIN: He's like 40? Fuck that. Fine.

1862
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:53,958
SAM: You could stand on the dog and get another
foot.

1863
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:55,462
LAURA: Stand on Travis's back!

1864
02:07:55,462 --> 02:07:57,185
SAM: That's almost ten feet.

1865
02:07:57,185 --> 02:07:58,686
TRAVIS: Like a cheerleader!

1866
02:07:58,686 --> 02:08:01,562
LAURA: This is serious!

1867
02:08:01,562 --> 02:08:03,054
TRAVIS: Statue of Liberty!

1868
02:08:03,054 --> 02:08:05,219
SAM: There's a car. You can jump up on the car.

1869
02:08:05,219 --> 02:08:06,487
LIAM: Is that Silly Putty?

1870
02:08:06,487 --> 02:08:08,066
LAURA: It's taffy!

1871
02:08:08,066 --> 02:08:11,331
SAM: Yeah, you want to try this Big Hunk, by the
way? Here, Travis.

1872
02:08:11,331 --> 02:08:19,212
TALIESIN: I suppose with everything going on, I'll
do another Chill Touch at Jerky McJerkFace.

1873
02:08:19,212 --> 02:08:21,653
TRAVIS: I feel like your dentist tells you not to
eat this.

1874
02:08:21,653 --> 02:08:25,201
TALIESIN: 13?

1875
02:08:25,201 --> 02:08:33,238
LIAM: Doesn't make it. Laura. Eat that taffy and
attack that motherfucker.

1876
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:34,633
LAURA: Which one?

1877
02:08:34,633 --> 02:08:39,350
LIAM: Anyone you want. There's a Liam next to
you. Pick your O'Brien.

1878
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:41,417
LAURA: I'm going to kill Liam.

1879
02:08:41,417 --> 02:08:45,598
LIAM: Okay, go for it. Roll to attack.

1880
02:08:45,598 --> 02:08:47,772
LAURA: Is somebody standing next to him?

1881
02:08:47,772 --> 02:08:50,846
LIAM: Taliesin's there. You're good.

1882
02:08:50,846 --> 02:08:54,399
LAURA: 24!

1883
02:08:54,399 --> 02:08:57,447
LIAM: That hits.

1884
02:08:57,447 --> 02:09:03,525
LAURA: 12!

1885
02:09:03,525 --> 02:09:08,972
LIAM: Okay. You sink the dagger into Liam's
stomach, right through the bellybutton. Blood goes

1886
02:09:08,972 --> 02:09:16,438
(spurting). He clings at that arm and pulls you
down and says, "I loved you like a sister."

1887
02:09:16,438 --> 02:09:19,222
SAM: Every time, it's a guilt trip.

1888
02:09:19,222 --> 02:09:20,651
TRAVIS: Brutal!

1889
02:09:20,651 --> 02:09:22,304
LAURA: I'm scarred for life.

1890
02:09:22,304 --> 02:09:24,273
TALIESIN: As a bonus action, I'm looting the
shirt.

1891
02:09:24,273 --> 02:09:26,508
(laughter)

1892
02:09:26,508 --> 02:09:28,254
TRAVIS: The yellow lion shirt!

1893
02:09:28,254 --> 02:09:31,248
LIAM: It's totally messed up now. Travis, what
would you like to do?

1894
02:09:31,248 --> 02:09:34,532
SAM: We've got to get him down.

1895
02:09:34,532 --> 02:09:38,289
LAURA: Oh, I want to run. I'm going to use my
movement to run for the tower.

1896
02:09:38,289 --> 02:09:40,013
SAM and TALIESIN: Good call.

1897
02:09:40,013 --> 02:09:43,102
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to where Sam is?

1898
02:09:43,102 --> 02:09:47,159
LIAM: Sure, you can. (counting)

1899
02:09:47,159 --> 02:09:55,557
TRAVIS: I turn to Conan O'Brien and I say, will
you accept a sacrifice for mercy?

1900
02:09:55,557 --> 02:10:00,372
LIAM: He calls down and says, "I'm listening!"

1901
02:10:00,372 --> 02:10:03,990
TRAVIS: I turn to Sam, and I try to cut one of his
arms off.

1902
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:06,325
LAURA: No! Travis!

1903
02:10:06,325 --> 02:10:08,823
LIAM: Roll to attack.

1904
02:10:08,823 --> 02:10:11,810
LAURA: That is terrible!

1905
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:13,701
TRAVIS: A ten! I think I missed!

1906
02:10:13,701 --> 02:10:21,614
LIAM: You turn to Riegel to do what nobody else is
willing to do.

1907
02:10:21,614 --> 02:10:24,604
TRAVIS: I make the hard calls!

1908
02:10:24,604 --> 02:10:31,633
LIAM: You bring that sword down, and you look into
Sam's big, giant eyes and big smile, and you can't

1909
02:10:31,633 --> 02:10:33,748
do it and you swing wide.

1910
02:10:33,748 --> 02:10:36,683
TRAVIS: That's right. That was just to see what he
would say, buddy!

1911
02:10:36,683 --> 02:10:38,002
SAM: Sure it was.

1912
02:10:38,002 --> 02:10:38,987
LIAM: Sam's turn.

1913
02:10:38,987 --> 02:10:46,753
SAM: All right. I'm going to start heading towards
the tower with all of my movement. And for my

1914
02:10:46,753 --> 02:10:57,152
attack, I command Bixby to attack Travis. And I
say to Travis, I am worth than you, motherfucker.

1915
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:03,076
I should be getting double scale. I have more
experience, I have more nuance. You can do one

1916
02:11:03,076 --> 02:11:07,149
thing: big, beefy characters, and that's it.

1917
02:11:07,149 --> 02:11:10,111
LIAM: What's your AC, Travis?

1918
02:11:10,111 --> 02:11:11,787
TRAVIS: It's 12.

1919
02:11:11,787 --> 02:11:17,401
LIAM: You feel small teeth sink into your ankle
and tear at a tendon a little bit. You take one

1920
02:11:17,401 --> 02:11:20,153
hit point of damage from Bixby the pug.

1921
02:11:20,153 --> 02:11:23,489
TRAVIS: You brought the dog into this!

1922
02:11:23,489 --> 02:11:28,198
TALIESIN: It just took Conan O'Brien for us to turn
on each other. That's all it fucking took.

1923
02:11:28,198 --> 02:11:32,140
LIAM: You hear (ripping).

1924
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:34,466
SAM: Oh no. More Liams!

1925
02:11:34,466 --> 02:11:35,670
TRAVIS: What?!

1926
02:11:35,670 --> 02:11:37,711
LAURA: They're endless; we have to take out
Conan.

1927
02:11:37,711 --> 02:11:47,698
LIAM: (laughs) The lich flies his horse-- ah, he's
dead! He wants to finish what he started. He

1928
02:11:47,698 --> 02:11:49,335
points at Sam again.

1929
02:11:49,335 --> 02:11:50,882
SAM: Oh god, again?!

1930
02:11:50,882 --> 02:12:03,630
LIAM: Let's see, where did it go? You are frozen
over for 14 hit points of damage. Covered like an

1931
02:12:03,630 --> 02:12:04,607
icicle.

1932
02:12:04,607 --> 02:12:05,849
SAM: I am unconscious.

1933
02:12:05,849 --> 02:12:10,106
LAURA: Oh no, Sam!  Oh no!

1934
02:12:10,106 --> 02:12:17,940
SAM: As I fall, I say, you did this, Travis! You
have my life on your conscience!

1935
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:20,458
LIAM: Taliesin, what would you like to do?

1936
02:12:20,458 --> 02:12:23,236
SAM: Wait, do I make a death saving throw? I don't
know how this works! Next round.

1937
02:12:23,236 --> 02:12:29,766
TALIESIN: I'm going to book it towards the tower,
as well.

1938
02:12:29,766 --> 02:12:33,954
LIAM: You want to swing wide of that guy?

1939
02:12:33,954 --> 02:12:38,516
TALIESIN: I'm going to swing wide, and as I swing
wide across him, I'm going to hit him with the

1940
02:12:38,516 --> 02:12:39,800
Chill Touch.

1941
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:42,446
LIAM: Conan or a Liam?

1942
02:12:42,446 --> 02:12:45,399
TALIESIN: Yeah, Conan.

1943
02:12:45,399 --> 02:12:48,940
SAM: I was your only ranged attacker!

1944
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,568
LAURA: I know!

1945
02:12:50,568 --> 02:12:52,866
TALIESIN: 17.

1946
02:12:52,866 --> 02:12:56,659
LIAM: That hits. Wait, you're hitting Conan,
right? That hits.

1947
02:12:56,659 --> 02:13:03,286
TALIESIN: That's seven points of necrotic, plus
he's at disadvantage for attacks.

1948
02:13:03,286 --> 02:13:07,252
SAM: But wait. Wasn't he at disadvantage for other
things?

1949
02:13:07,252 --> 02:13:12,220
LIAM: Sure. I counted. Laura, you're up.

1950
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,428
LAURA: Did you just leave Sam on the ground? Is he
down?!

1951
02:13:16,428 --> 02:13:18,578
TALIESIN: He's frozen like a statue.

1952
02:13:18,578 --> 02:13:21,929
LAURA: I turn around and I run back to Sam! What
the fuck, you guys?!

1953
02:13:21,929 --> 02:13:24,652
(laughter)

1954
02:13:24,652 --> 02:13:26,344
SAM: What are you going to do?

1955
02:13:26,344 --> 02:13:28,500
LAURA: I'm going to try and drag your body. I
don't know!

1956
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:31,165
TRAVIS: Kill Conan! Don't worry about Sam! He'll
be fine.

1957
02:13:31,165 --> 02:13:34,068
LAURA: Is he right there?

1958
02:13:34,068 --> 02:13:35,909
LIAM: You're right on top of him now.

1959
02:13:35,909 --> 02:13:38,916
LAURA: Can I give him some Neosporin?

1960
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:42,132
LIAM: You don't have any, but you can maybe rip
off of some of his t-shirt and try to--

1961
02:13:42,132 --> 02:13:43,596
LAURA: I rip off some of his t-shirt--

1962
02:13:43,596 --> 02:13:47,170
SAM: In my frozen state, I say, mouth to mouth!

1963
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:51,320
(laughter)

1964
02:13:51,320 --> 02:14:06,579
LAURA: I rub all over his chest and try to warm up
his body. Warm up, you motherfucker. 13.

1965
02:14:06,579 --> 02:14:09,024
LIAM: Man, your hands are so cold now.

1966
02:14:09,024 --> 02:14:12,821
LAURA: Shit. Fuck. I kick him. Come on, man, wake
up.

1967
02:14:12,821 --> 02:14:14,320
TRAVIS: He's frozen!

1968
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,906
LIAM: Travis, you're up.

1969
02:14:15,906 --> 02:14:17,016
SAM: That's your whole turn?

1970
02:14:17,016 --> 02:14:18,596
LAURA: I guess so!

1971
02:14:18,596 --> 02:14:21,910
TRAVIS: You would save Sam?

1972
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:25,005
SAM: (strained) Mouth to mouth!

1973
02:14:25,005 --> 02:14:31,868
TRAVIS: I look down at his frozen body and I say,
he was never good at the cold reads. And I fucking

1974
02:14:31,868 --> 02:14:33,631
stab him.

1975
02:14:33,631 --> 02:14:35,937
SAM: Wait, I'm far away from Travis!

1976
02:14:35,937 --> 02:14:38,430
LIAM: Where are we?

1977
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:47,722
SAM: Hey! My dog gets an attack of opportunity!
No, fails?

1978
02:14:47,722 --> 02:14:51,906
TRAVIS: Do I automatically crit?

1979
02:14:51,906 --> 02:14:57,097
LIAM: He takes two death-- well, you have to roll
to hit, right? Help me out, Taliesin. Do you have

1980
02:14:57,097 --> 02:14:58,716
to roll to hit?

1981
02:14:58,716 --> 02:15:03,092
TALIESIN: You roll to hit, I think, but you get an
auto-crit.

1982
02:15:03,092 --> 02:15:05,183
LAURA: No, you automatically hit. You don't have
to roll to hit.

1983
02:15:05,183 --> 02:15:07,082
LIAM: You just automatically hit? That's
familiar.

1984
02:15:07,082 --> 02:15:08,913
TRAVIS: Since you're down, it's two death saving
throws.

1985
02:15:08,913 --> 02:15:11,530
LIAM: Okay, that arm you wanted to chop off
before? Breaks free.

1986
02:15:11,530 --> 02:15:18,294
LAURA: Travis Willingham! You do not kill Sam
Riegel right now!

1987
02:15:18,294 --> 02:15:21,626
TALIESIN: You've got a throwable weapon! That's a
start.

1988
02:15:21,626 --> 02:15:23,205
TRAVIS: I already tried!

1989
02:15:23,205 --> 02:15:24,666
SAM: No, my arm.

1990
02:15:24,666 --> 02:15:26,347
TRAVIS: Oh, good!

1991
02:15:26,347 --> 02:15:29,715
LIAM: Three Liams converge on Taliesin.

1992
02:15:29,715 --> 02:15:33,448
LAURA: Oh my god! It's because you're turning
against each other!

1993
02:15:33,448 --> 02:15:34,744
LIAM: What's your AC?

1994
02:15:34,744 --> 02:15:35,710
TALIESIN: 11.

1995
02:15:35,710 --> 02:15:36,885
SAM: Blame my agent.

1996
02:15:36,885 --> 02:15:50,712
LIAM: That hit. Okay. One of them just faceplants
right under your legs and eats shit, but two of

1997
02:15:50,712 --> 02:15:56,580
them latch onto your arms and bite into each
separate arm. You take a total of four points of

1998
02:15:56,580 --> 02:16:13,391
damage as they rend away part of the flesh of your
biceps. Suddenly, you hear a deafening (ripping)

1999
02:16:13,391 --> 02:16:22,990
and the sound of a motorcycle (engine sounds). You
all turn and look, except for Sam, over in this

2000
02:16:22,990 --> 02:16:30,458
direction. I don't have a motorcycle mini, but you
see two figures plowing through the dirt on a

2001
02:16:30,458 --> 02:16:39,184
motorcycle with a sidecar. You see they're
familiar, but they don't look the same. You see a

2002
02:16:39,184 --> 02:16:47,389
badass cut fucking woman with red hair streaming
behind her, tats all up her arms and a bandanna

2003
02:16:47,389 --> 02:16:55,149
tied around her head. And in the sidecar is this
fucking dude with long hair and an eyepatch and a

2004
02:16:55,149 --> 02:17:02,437
shotgun hanging off his side with a guitar. And
the motorcycle pulls up right here.

2005
02:17:02,437 --> 02:17:05,844
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

2006
02:17:05,844 --> 02:17:13,327
LIAM: Here is the sidecar. Here is the driver of
the motorcycle. And they look over you, and Mercer

2007
02:17:13,327 --> 02:17:22,610
shouts, "We don't have much time! We have to act
<i>now!</i>" Marisha, cut like Linda Hamilton, leaps

2008
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:29,765
off the motorcycle, does a flip here (whoosh). You
see her go (impact, fire).

2009
02:17:29,765 --> 02:17:31,472
LAURA: Is she really a wizard?

2010
02:17:31,472 --> 02:17:39,274
LIAM: No, she is not. Her muscles flex and a
dragon swirls around her hand and fire shoots out,

2011
02:17:39,274 --> 02:17:48,104
(flame impact) hits the Warner Brothers tower. It
explodes in flame. You hear metal creak and groan

2012
02:17:48,104 --> 02:17:50,010
(creaking).

2013
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:52,072
TRAVIS: Hurry, Laura, run! I'll get Sam!

2014
02:17:52,072 --> 02:17:54,358
LIAM: (crash)

2015
02:17:54,358 --> 02:17:56,877
SAM: (strained) Mouth to mouth!

2016
02:17:56,877 --> 02:18:04,823
LIAM: Grizzled Matt Mercer jumps down out of the
sidecar and says, "Hold on! I know it's rough.

2017
02:18:04,823 --> 02:18:12,007
"You're the only thing that can fix this!" He whips
the guitar off and goes (guitar chord). You feel

2018
02:18:12,007 --> 02:18:20,512
vibrations rush out over all of you. Your wounds
close up. Sam starts to thaw. The arm goes

2019
02:18:20,512 --> 02:18:21,734
(shoonk).

2020
02:18:21,734 --> 02:18:23,099
LAURA: Oh, it's reconnected?

2021
02:18:23,099 --> 02:18:24,312
SAM: Oh, thank god!

2022
02:18:24,312 --> 02:18:31,114
LIAM: All the ice melts away. Any wounds you have
heal. Whatever your hit point total was after

2023
02:18:31,114 --> 02:18:36,410
Ashley, you have just received 30 hit points. So
if you're at zero, you're up as high as you can

2024
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:39,009
go. These Liams--

2025
02:18:39,009 --> 02:18:41,781
SAM: Oh, but those were temporary hit points from
Ashley, right?

2026
02:18:41,781 --> 02:18:43,022
LIAM: They're still there.

2027
02:18:43,022 --> 02:18:44,749
SAM: Ooh! So I'm at 30.

2028
02:18:44,749 --> 02:18:52,219
LIAM: You don't go higher. If you were at full,
you're at full. These three Liams explode like

2029
02:18:52,219 --> 02:18:54,188
sausages. (squelching)

2030
02:18:54,188 --> 02:18:56,255
SAM: God, Matt's so powerful.

2031
02:18:56,255 --> 02:18:59,145
LAURA: Seriously, how are you guys so badass and
we suck?

2032
02:18:59,145 --> 02:19:04,157
LIAM: Marisha yells, "It's already over! There's
no--" (ripping)

2033
02:19:04,157 --> 02:19:05,262
LAURA: Oh no!

2034
02:19:05,262 --> 02:19:06,820
SAM: What, did they bamf out?

2035
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:14,546
LIAM: The horse goes (horse scream), crumbles to
dust and Conan goes, "Fuck!"

2036
02:19:14,546 --> 02:19:19,004
LAURA: Oh my god.

2037
02:19:19,004 --> 02:19:21,650
LIAM: Crawls to his feet.

2038
02:19:21,650 --> 02:19:25,220
LAURA: Oh shit. The lich is still alive?

2039
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:28,067
LIAM: Conan is still here.

2040
02:19:28,067 --> 02:19:30,868
LAURA: (gasps) We got to attack the Conan!

2041
02:19:30,868 --> 02:19:41,456
LIAM: One, two, three, four. He reaches out with
skeletal hands at your face, Laura. What's your AC?

2042
02:19:41,456 --> 02:19:42,586
LAURA: 13.

2043
02:19:42,586 --> 02:19:56,043
LIAM: 13, you say? Okay, you take 11 points of
damage, and please make a constitution save.

2044
02:19:56,043 --> 02:19:59,821
TRAVIS: Whoa! (belches)

2045
02:19:59,821 --> 02:20:04,050
LIAM: You feel the veins throb in your neck.

2046
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:05,530
LAURA: Oh no, a seven.

2047
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:11,136
LIAM: A seven? The muscles lock up. You can't
move.

2048
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:14,180
TRAVIS: You damn Irishman! You'll pay for that!

2049
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:16,880
LIAM: Taliesin, you are up.

2050
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:28,458
TALIESIN: Chill Touch at the Conan O'Lichman. I
should roll a d20. 14.

2051
02:20:28,458 --> 02:20:30,713
LIAM: Yes.

2052
02:20:30,713 --> 02:20:32,113
SAM: Oh! That hits?

2053
02:20:32,113 --> 02:20:33,521
LIAM: It does now.

2054
02:20:33,521 --> 02:20:34,796
LAURA: He's on the ground!

2055
02:20:34,796 --> 02:20:40,074
TALIESIN: That's six points of necrotic, plus
disadvantage.

2056
02:20:40,074 --> 02:20:41,783
LIAM: Okay, so what was the total damage?

2057
02:20:41,783 --> 02:20:43,586
TALIESIN: Six. Six necrotic.

2058
02:20:43,586 --> 02:20:51,205
LIAM: Okay. Laura's frozen. Travis, you're up.

2059
02:20:51,205 --> 02:20:56,599
TRAVIS: I finally take the sword, and I swing wild
like a maniac!

2060
02:20:56,599 --> 02:20:58,997
LAURA: Be careful. Don't hit me!

2061
02:20:58,997 --> 02:21:05,727
TRAVIS: I won't hit you. 15.

2062
02:21:05,727 --> 02:21:06,844
LIAM: 15 hits.

2063
02:21:06,844 --> 02:21:15,527
TRAVIS: Ooh! 16.

2064
02:21:15,527 --> 02:21:17,224
LIAM: Of damage?

2065
02:21:17,224 --> 02:21:18,203
TRAVIS: Yes.

2066
02:21:18,203 --> 02:21:25,528
LIAM: Okay. You hack his arm off. Falls to the
ground. 15 total, you said, right?

2067
02:21:25,528 --> 02:21:26,996
TRAVIS: Actually, it's 14.

2068
02:21:26,996 --> 02:21:33,283
LIAM: 14, okay. We are now on to Sam. What would
you like to do, Frosty?

2069
02:21:33,283 --> 02:21:35,649
SAM: I have an arm again?

2070
02:21:35,649 --> 02:21:36,538
LIAM: Yeah.

2071
02:21:36,538 --> 02:21:39,004
SAM: Damn, that Matt is so powerful.

2072
02:21:39,004 --> 02:21:41,608
LIAM: Level 20, yo.

2073
02:21:41,608 --> 02:21:44,749
LAURA: He was at level 20?! Fuck.

2074
02:21:44,749 --> 02:21:50,938
SAM: He needs to be nerfed. Am I too close for a
ranged weapon attack?

2075
02:21:50,938 --> 02:21:55,106
LIAM: No, you're not too close, but you probably
want to get clear of Laura.

2076
02:21:55,106 --> 02:21:58,095
LAURA: Don't hit me.

2077
02:21:58,095 --> 02:22:04,413
SAM: Not knowing what's going on with Laura, I'll
use my movement to quickly give her mouth to

2078
02:22:04,413 --> 02:22:08,886
mouth. Because I think she's frozen. She might be
hyperventilating.

2079
02:22:08,886 --> 02:22:15,059
LIAM: All right, make a medicine check.

2080
02:22:15,059 --> 02:22:16,453
SAM: It's a natural one.

2081
02:22:16,453 --> 02:22:17,442
(laughter)

2082
02:22:17,442 --> 02:22:18,665
TRAVIS: Hey, justice!

2083
02:22:18,665 --> 02:22:21,076
SAM: (moaning)

2084
02:22:21,076 --> 02:22:24,576
LIAM: You run over, you start to kiss her. You cut
your lip on her teeth.

2085
02:22:24,576 --> 02:22:32,047
SAM: Ow! Braces, what? Invisalign?

2086
02:22:32,047 --> 02:22:42,337
LIAM: The lich turns towards Big Man here. What's
your armor class?

2087
02:22:42,337 --> 02:22:43,707
TRAVIS: 12.

2088
02:22:43,707 --> 02:22:47,724
LIAM: Make a constitution save, please.

2089
02:22:47,724 --> 02:22:50,669
TRAVIS: 22.

2090
02:22:50,669 --> 02:22:55,727
LIAM: You take 12 points of damage, and you feel
your muscles start to lock up and you go, "Pull it

2091
02:22:55,727 --> 02:22:56,951
"together, Travis!"

2092
02:22:56,951 --> 02:22:58,420
TRAVIS: Pull that shit together!

2093
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:01,232
LIAM: (breathes heavily) You're still moving.

2094
02:23:01,232 --> 02:23:05,660
TRAVIS: How much was the damage? Eight?

2095
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:11,966
LIAM: No, it was 12, that's right. Taliesin, you
are up.

2096
02:23:11,966 --> 02:23:17,019
TALIESIN: I take a step closer to the lich and hit
him again with the Chill Touch. I'm going to just

2097
02:23:17,019 --> 02:23:20,079
keep hitting him. Natural 20.

2098
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:21,470
TRAVIS and SAM: Whoa!

2099
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:23,585
LAURA: Oh, Chilly Touch!

2100
02:23:23,585 --> 02:23:30,517
TALIESIN: Double dice? Roll twice or double it?

2101
02:23:30,552 --> 02:23:32,453
LIAM: Double the dice.

2102
02:23:32,453 --> 02:23:34,794
TALIESIN: 14 points of necrotic damage.

2103
02:23:34,794 --> 02:23:36,816
LIAM: In what manner would you like to kill this?

2104
02:23:36,816 --> 02:23:39,026
TRAVIS: Oh! In what manner?!

2105
02:23:39,026 --> 02:23:44,577
SAM: (laughing) In what manner would you like to
kill this? Put it on a shirt.

2106
02:23:44,577 --> 02:23:50,834
TALIESIN: I've thought about this so many times.

2107
02:23:50,834 --> 02:23:56,258
SAM: Just say, more like Conan O'Dyin'. I don't
know.

2108
02:23:56,258 --> 02:24:05,059
TALIESIN: That was pretty good. I'm going to take
my skeletal freezing hand and start slapping him

2109
02:24:05,059 --> 02:24:11,955
down into the dirt. (yelling) You're terrible at
video games! You're awful! You're just terrible!

2110
02:24:11,955 --> 02:24:14,016
You make Mortal Kombat look bad!

2111
02:24:14,016 --> 02:24:22,331
LIAM: And the tentacle slaps and slaps and slaps
and knocks bone after bone away. He backs up and

2112
02:24:22,331 --> 02:24:30,502
goes (whines). Does that little thing Conan does.
Snips, and all the bones go (collapsing noises) to

2113
02:24:30,502 --> 02:24:31,870
the ground.

2114
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:36,175
TALIESIN: I go to loot the body, or what's left of
it.

2115
02:24:36,175 --> 02:24:38,619
SAM: Wait, can't liches get back up again?

2116
02:24:38,619 --> 02:24:40,699
LAURA: Am I still frozen? Or did it unfreeze me?

2117
02:24:40,699 --> 02:24:44,026
LIAM: You feel flexibility come back to your
arms.

2118
02:24:44,026 --> 02:24:48,681
LAURA: Good job, Taliesin! Oh my gosh.

2119
02:24:48,681 --> 02:24:50,951
SAM: It is going to heal itself?

2120
02:24:50,951 --> 02:24:52,587
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to start
grabbing bones.

2121
02:24:52,587 --> 02:24:57,477
TRAVIS: I walk up and I take his giant orange
pompadoured skull, and I stick it in the gym bag.

2122
02:24:57,477 --> 02:24:59,737
LIAM: Okay, the Gym Bag of Holding?

2123
02:24:59,737 --> 02:25:02,517
LAURA: You're turning into Grog.

2124
02:25:02,517 --> 02:25:06,535
LIAM: All right, you have a lich's skull.

2125
02:25:06,535 --> 02:25:12,292
LAURA: I thought that was going to fix everything.
Are we supposed to still turn back time or

2126
02:25:12,292 --> 02:25:13,086
something?

2127
02:25:13,227 --> 02:25:15,566
TALIESIN: Does he have anything on him? Is there
anything I find in the pile?

2128
02:25:15,566 --> 02:25:17,409
LIAM: No.

2129
02:25:17,409 --> 02:25:24,552
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn around then and go
look at the water tower. Towards the tower.

2130
02:25:24,552 --> 02:25:28,203
LIAM: The tower is slowing melting into the
ground.

2131
02:25:28,203 --> 02:25:30,238
LAURA: I thought there was a clock we're supposed
to fix.

2132
02:25:30,238 --> 02:25:38,739
LIAM: Bixby comes waddling up to you with a bone
in his mouth and he drops it and looks up at you

2133
02:25:38,739 --> 02:25:52,512
all. You feel (wind noises)-- you get pushed
forward through time, who knows where? That's the

2134
02:25:52,512 --> 02:25:59,169
end of the session. Really, I was waiting for
different music to kick in about a minute ago. It

2135
02:25:59,169 --> 02:26:01,677
didn't come and the (thump, thump) was making you
guys go, "What's next?"

2136
02:26:01,677 --> 02:26:05,778
SAM: But that's it. We did it.

2137
02:26:05,778 --> 02:26:07,319
LAURA: Oh my gosh, we fixed it?

2138
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:10,132
TRAVIS: So wait, somewhere forward in time, it's
just the four of us, right?

2139
02:26:10,132 --> 02:26:12,105
LIAM: You guys are together somewhere, with a
dog.

2140
02:26:12,105 --> 02:26:15,854
TRAVIS: Over the next day, I kill Taliesin and Sam
and start the new human race.

2141
02:26:15,854 --> 02:26:18,772
TALIESIN: I cast Hellish Rebuke. If he touches me,
I cast Hellish Rebuke.

2142
02:26:18,772 --> 02:26:22,342
LIAM: Oh man, I'm sure I fudged so many rules.

2143
02:26:22,342 --> 02:26:24,989
TRAVIS: Who gives a fuck?

2144
02:26:24,989 --> 02:26:26,536
LAURA: That was so much fun, Liam.

2145
02:26:26,536 --> 02:26:27,918
TRAVIS: Yeah! Liam!

2146
02:26:27,918 --> 02:26:32,420
LAURA: I'm sorry I killed you so many times!

2147
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:34,425
TRAVIS: Great job, man!

2148
02:26:34,425 --> 02:26:35,588
LIAM: That was so meta!

2149
02:26:35,588 --> 02:26:36,960
TRAVIS and LIAM: So meta!

2150
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:40,163
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we have time left. Do we take
questions?

2151
02:26:40,163 --> 02:26:41,503
LAURA: Wait, how much time do we have left?

2152
02:26:41,503 --> 02:26:46,730
LIAM: Yeah, we totally could. Do we want to take a
fiver and fly out the couch?

2153
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:48,563
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

2154
02:26:48,563 --> 02:26:54,275
LIAM: All right guys, totally winging this
tonight. We're going to fly out all this shit and

2155
02:26:54,275 --> 02:26:59,692
bring in a couch. We'll do 30 or 40 minutes of
questions. All right, start tweeting

2156
02:26:59,692 --> 02:27:04,071
#criticalrolebixley.

2157
02:27:04,071 --> 02:27:05,234
LAURA: Bixley?

2158
02:27:05,234 --> 02:27:07,500
LIAM: Well, something different than just
#criticalrole.

2159
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:10,323
TALIESIN: Oh. Bixley?

2160
02:27:10,323 --> 02:27:12,438
SAM: Wait, what? Huh? I don't know.

2161
02:27:12,438 --> 02:27:13,339
CREW: #criticalconan!

2162
02:27:13,339 --> 02:27:14,688
LAURA: #criticalobrien!

2163
02:27:14,688 --> 02:27:16,060
SAM and LIAM: #criticalobrien.

2164
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:18,619
LAURA: I hope you guys spell his name right.

2165
02:27:18,619 --> 02:27:22,911
LIAM: With an E. Anyway, that was a ton of fun. I
was totally freaking out in the first five minutes,

2166
02:27:22,911 --> 02:27:25,244
and then it didn't matter anymore.

2167
02:27:25,306 --> 02:27:26,376
TRAVIS: You did a great job.

2168
02:27:26,376 --> 02:27:27,598
LAURA: Good job, man.

2169
02:27:27,598 --> 02:36:23,945
[break]

2170
02:36:23,945 --> 02:36:26,232
TRAVIS: As long as manslaughter is all that they
charge--

2171
02:36:26,232 --> 02:36:27,783
TALIESIN: Oh, hey!

2172
02:36:27,783 --> 02:36:33,672
LIAM: We're doing it live. There are so many
questions on this hashtag we threw out. I'm a

2173
02:36:33,672 --> 02:36:35,958
little overwhelmed. Holy shit.

2174
02:36:35,958 --> 02:36:38,975
LAURA: Oh, hey guys! Oh, thanks for joining us,
Sam.

2175
02:36:38,975 --> 02:36:41,948
SAM: Sorry, someone told me I had some Zagnut in
my teeth.

2176
02:36:41,948 --> 02:36:46,961
LAURA: He really did, though. Is that the camera,
or is that the camera?

2177
02:36:46,961 --> 02:36:48,238
TRAVIS: Both of them.

2178
02:36:48,238 --> 02:36:49,515
SAM: We can all fit here.

2179
02:36:49,515 --> 02:36:51,338
LAURA: I feel like we could squeeze in.

2180
02:36:51,338 --> 02:36:55,795
TALIESIN: Are we going to do this? All right,
we're going to do this.

2181
02:36:55,795 --> 02:37:06,671
LIAM: Let's go through the hashtag and find some
questions. Thanks. That was a lot of fun for me to do.

2182
02:37:06,671 --> 02:37:08,015
LAURA: Would you consider taking--

2183
02:37:08,015 --> 02:37:10,922
TRAVIS: -- Critical Role on an international tour?
Baby steps.

2184
02:37:10,922 --> 02:37:12,961
SAM: Let's see how this live show goes.

2185
02:37:12,961 --> 02:37:19,705
LAURA: Question: Travis, are you really--

2186
02:37:19,705 --> 02:37:21,912
SAM: -- getting double scale for this?

2187
02:37:21,912 --> 02:37:23,853
TRAVIS: Totally.

2188
02:37:23,853 --> 02:37:31,707
LIAM: Someone's asking, I mean, we get it all the
time, I guess we can put it to rest, how old our

2189
02:37:31,707 --> 02:37:33,053
characters are.

2190
02:37:33,053 --> 02:37:34,764
LAURA: In this game?

2191
02:37:34,764 --> 02:37:37,814
TALIESIN: According to IMDB...

2192
02:37:37,814 --> 02:37:39,810
TRAVIS: I don't think Grog knows.

2193
02:37:39,810 --> 02:37:42,142
LIAM: That makes sense.

2194
02:37:42,142 --> 02:37:43,517
LAURA: Oh man, that's so sad!

2195
02:37:43,517 --> 02:37:44,837
TRAVIS: Why would I count those things?

2196
02:37:44,837 --> 02:37:46,752
LAURA: I don't know. You can't count past six,
anyway.

2197
02:37:46,752 --> 02:37:48,849
TRAVIS: No, I just know once a year, people give
me sweet things and cake.

2198
02:37:48,849 --> 02:37:51,004
LAURA: That's so sweet.

2199
02:37:51,004 --> 02:37:52,494
TRAVIS: Get your hand off me.

2200
02:37:52,494 --> 02:37:54,619
LAURA: We're, what, 27?

2201
02:37:54,619 --> 02:37:58,479
LIAM: 27 I think is what we said at one point. It
could be 28 at this point.

2202
02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:03,249
TALIESIN: Early 20s. I don't like to pin it down.
Early 20s.

2203
02:38:03,249 --> 02:38:04,505
TRAVIS: Sam, what about you?

2204
02:38:04,505 --> 02:38:07,232
SAM: I'm a little older than that.

2205
02:38:07,232 --> 02:38:11,153
TALIESIN: With time change, or without, because
you've also got the crazy time shit.

2206
02:38:11,153 --> 02:38:16,190
SAM: Apparently, they undid that. I never asked
for it to be undone.

2207
02:38:16,190 --> 02:38:17,643
LAURA: Are you in your 40s?

2208
02:38:17,643 --> 02:38:20,677
SAM: I look like I am around your guys' age.

2209
02:38:20,677 --> 02:38:24,654
LAURA: Oh really? Do gnomes age differently?

2210
02:38:24,654 --> 02:38:29,483
SAM: They do age differently. They are on a slower
scale than you guys.

2211
02:38:29,483 --> 02:38:30,642
LAURA: We are, too.

2212
02:38:30,642 --> 02:38:34,933
SAM: You guys are half-elves, so you're only
barely different.

2213
02:38:34,933 --> 02:38:37,825
LAURA: We live around to 150, don't we?

2214
02:38:37,825 --> 02:38:44,369
SAM: So if you're 27 years old, that means that
you guys are teenagers.

2215
02:38:44,369 --> 02:38:51,075
TALIESIN: It's the medieval era. You die before
40, really. You guys are going to live forever.

2216
02:38:51,075 --> 02:38:55,193
SAM: Yeah, but if you're 27-year-old half-elves,
do you look like you're 18-year-olds?

2217
02:38:55,193 --> 02:38:56,737
LAURA: We probably look around 20.

2218
02:38:56,737 --> 02:38:58,998
TRAVIS: Next question.

2219
02:38:58,998 --> 02:39:05,164
LIAM: Someone asked how much-- not the Cthulhu
portion of the game, but how much the early part

2220
02:39:05,164 --> 02:39:06,752
of the game was true to life.

2221
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:08,785
LAURA: It was exaggerated.

2222
02:39:08,785 --> 02:39:10,320
SAM: We are working on that game.

2223
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:19,819
LIAM: We were talking about a real place that we
work at a lot and people we see, and some of that

2224
02:39:19,819 --> 02:39:20,981
was realistic.

2225
02:39:20,981 --> 02:39:22,748
LAURA: Pierce is real. Emma's real.

2226
02:39:22,748 --> 02:39:29,938
SAM: Emma is real. Warner Brothers Games is a game
place where we record much.

2227
02:39:29,938 --> 02:39:32,800
TALIESIN: They really have a giant television on a
swinging arm.

2228
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:37,937
LAURA: All of the layout of the booths is exactly
right. There is really gold coming out of the

2229
02:39:37,937 --> 02:39:39,745
kitchen. All the time.

2230
02:39:39,745 --> 02:39:41,137
TALIESIN: Makes it really hard to get tea.

2231
02:39:41,137 --> 02:39:44,636
SAM: Pierce is awesome.

2232
02:39:44,636 --> 02:39:47,255
LAURA: And he started playing DND because of
Critical Role!

2233
02:39:47,255 --> 02:39:49,616
TRAVIS: That's true. You can find him at Emerald
Knights.

2234
02:39:49,616 --> 02:39:50,974
LAURA: Yeah, that's right.

2235
02:39:50,974 --> 02:39:53,293
TALIESIN: He needs fanart.

2236
02:39:53,293 --> 02:39:59,241
SAM: If you could play as another character of Vox
Machina, body switch for a day, who would it be?

2237
02:39:59,241 --> 02:40:00,959
TRAVIS: Scanlan.

2238
02:40:00,959 --> 02:40:02,361
LAURA: I know, right?

2239
02:40:02,361 --> 02:40:07,659
LIAM: That would be the hard one. I keep thinking
it would be fun, for a one-off, magically have--

2240
02:40:07,659 --> 02:40:08,931
LAURA: The abilities?

2241
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:17,242
LIAM: No, to be Vax, but with one of your
personalities in me so I would have to be you in

2242
02:40:17,242 --> 02:40:19,933
me and start talking like this the whole time, you
know?

2243
02:40:19,933 --> 02:40:22,168
TALIESIN: Well, no, because we'd be playing each
other, then.

2244
02:40:22,168 --> 02:40:28,202
LIAM: But if I were Vax's body with Percy inside,
I'd have to start talking the way you do.

2245
02:40:28,202 --> 02:40:33,244
TALIESIN: Yeah, that would be fun. I would like to
be Grog. That would be fun.

2246
02:40:33,244 --> 02:40:44,043
SAM: I think I would, if I could switch
characters, well, Grog is pretty fun, man. It's a

2247
02:40:44,043 --> 02:40:49,970
pretty fun character, and he does big damages and
stuff. Yeah, I think Grog. It's fun to be dumb.

2248
02:40:49,970 --> 02:40:51,428
TRAVIS: It is.

2249
02:40:51,428 --> 02:40:55,056
LIAM: I know the one I would not want to do is
Scanlan because I don't think I could pull it off.

2250
02:40:55,056 --> 02:40:57,542
LAURA: I know, you're so quick. That's too hard.

2251
02:40:57,542 --> 02:40:59,004
SAM: I have a team of writers.

2252
02:40:59,004 --> 02:41:01,363
(laughter)

2253
02:41:01,363 --> 02:41:02,840
SAM: I hired a team of writers.

2254
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:05,636
LAURA: It's really fun to watch, but I would feel
so intimidated trying to play.

2255
02:41:05,636 --> 02:41:07,249
SAM: That is so flattering.

2256
02:41:07,249 --> 02:41:10,341
TRAVIS: (gasps) Any plans to come to Nashville,
Tennessee? I work for the Titans and could

2257
02:41:10,341 --> 02:41:15,560
possibly do something cool for you guys. If the
Cowboys are playing the Titans, maybe we will.

2258
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:21,985
SAM: Could "possibly do something cool for you
guys" mean give Travis a starting lineup on the

2259
02:41:21,985 --> 02:41:25,003
Titans for one game? Maybe preseason game?

2260
02:41:25,003 --> 02:41:26,313
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

2261
02:41:26,313 --> 02:41:28,655
SAM: You played some ball.

2262
02:41:28,655 --> 02:41:30,475
TRAVIS: I did. I played some college ball.

2263
02:41:30,475 --> 02:41:35,071
SAM: If you were given the shot, just one shot,
you get one play, what position are you going to

2264
02:41:35,071 --> 02:41:37,669
play, defense/offense?

2265
02:41:37,669 --> 02:41:42,422
TRAVIS: Tight end, a button, a bootleg to the
left.

2266
02:41:42,422 --> 02:41:43,532
SAM: So you're blocking.

2267
02:41:43,532 --> 02:41:44,728
TRAVIS: No, I'm catching the ball.

2268
02:41:44,728 --> 02:41:47,085
TALIESIN: We don't actually know how the game is
played.

2269
02:41:47,085 --> 02:41:55,356
LIAM: People are curious what class Marisha was
for her brief cameo. She was a monk. I asked

2270
02:41:55,356 --> 02:41:59,815
everyone what they thought they would be. That's
not true; I didn't ask Ashley, but I knew what I

2271
02:41:59,815 --> 02:42:05,450
wanted to do for the story. Marisha texted me
somewhere in the middle of the game because I told

2272
02:42:05,450 --> 02:42:10,275
Matt and Marisha about all of this. I was too
flummoxed to answer, but she said, "If you don't

2273
02:42:10,275 --> 02:42:12,605
"have me say 'dope' somewhere in there..."

2274
02:42:12,605 --> 02:42:16,158
TALIESIN: I think she's got it tattooed 
on her arms.

2275
02:42:16,158 --> 02:42:20,080
LIAM: Sorry, Marisha. It all went by so quick.

2276
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:23,200
TRAVIS: Question. Will Vax and Gilmore ever end up
together?

2277
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:26,103
LIAM: I don't know.

2278
02:42:26,103 --> 02:42:28,794
LAURA: Who knows where life will take you guys?

2279
02:42:28,794 --> 02:42:33,406
LIAM: I will say that Vax is head-over-heels,
completely in love with Keyleth, so if you guys

2280
02:42:33,406 --> 02:42:38,942
want him to go get it on with Gilmore when he is
seriously in love with another person, okay.

2281
02:42:38,942 --> 02:42:41,234
LAURA: I think some people would be okay with
that.

2282
02:42:41,234 --> 02:42:42,488
LIAM: I do, too.

2283
02:42:42,488 --> 02:42:49,358
LAURA: Travis, on a scale of one to 22, how much
do you-- oh. It went away as I was reading it.

2284
02:42:49,358 --> 02:42:56,161
SAM: It said, how much do the Giants,
Washington's team, and the Eagles suck? I refuse

2285
02:42:56,161 --> 02:42:58,678
to say the name of Washington's team.

2286
02:42:58,678 --> 02:43:00,376
TRAVIS: Yeah. Pretty bad.

2287
02:43:00,376 --> 02:43:05,173
SAM: Question. Liam, what was your inspiration for
this story?

2288
02:43:05,173 --> 02:43:12,519
LIAM: Well, listen. I said literally the day
before I announced that I was going to do this

2289
02:43:12,519 --> 02:43:18,086
that I didn't want to do this, and the next day I
totally flip-flopped, because I was too busy with

2290
02:43:18,086 --> 02:43:21,934
work. I knew that I wanted to do something
eventually. I just figured it would be six or

2291
02:43:21,934 --> 02:43:28,769
seven months from now. But then I had all this time
open up to work on something, and the idea popped

2292
02:43:28,769 --> 02:43:33,067
into my head. I always knew I would want to do
something totally different from what Matt does

2293
02:43:33,067 --> 02:43:34,883
because he does it better than anybody.

2294
02:43:34,883 --> 02:43:36,895
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's intimidating.

2295
02:43:36,895 --> 02:43:42,212
LIAM: I don't want go anywhere near high fantasy
because he does it so perfectly, so I thought I

2296
02:43:42,212 --> 02:43:45,222
would go in the opposite direction and try to make
my friends--

2297
02:43:45,222 --> 02:43:48,238
TRAVIS: You killed it, man. It was awesome.

2298
02:43:48,238 --> 02:43:49,623
TALIESIN: You did. It was amazing.

2299
02:43:49,623 --> 02:43:55,227
LIAM: Eventually, as I thought it all out, I just
started thinking, what would the artists like to

2300
02:43:55,227 --> 02:43:57,973
draw? That's what it was like in the back 
end of designing.

2301
02:43:57,973 --> 02:44:02,345
TRAVIS: Taliesin, what kind of things do you have
in your car for this sort of scenario?

2302
02:44:02,409 --> 02:44:10,121
TALIESIN: Legitimately, right now in my car I have
a quiver of arrows. I do. Still left over from the

2303
02:44:10,121 --> 02:44:12,622
photo shoot. I haven't returned them to my friend
Ashley.

2304
02:44:12,622 --> 02:44:14,319
LAURA: Shit, Taliesin, that was a while ago.

2305
02:44:14,319 --> 02:44:20,360
TALIESIN: Yeah, I haven't cleaned out my car, so I
have that. I have my laptop and all my work stuff

2306
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:28,797
and phone chargers. I've got a black velvet frock
coat, large leather boots-- I'm not kidding about

2307
02:44:28,797 --> 02:44:32,773
any of this-- a hardcover copy of The Wicked + The
Divine. Thank you for putting that on my character

2308
02:44:32,773 --> 02:44:38,685
sheet. And some nail wraps. Thank you for putting
that on my character sheet. Although not the ones I

2309
02:44:38,685 --> 02:44:45,426
used in the game, because the ones I
would have used in the game would have been the

2310
02:44:45,426 --> 02:44:47,515
limited edition Hamilton Federalist Papers.

2311
02:44:47,515 --> 02:44:49,071
LAURA: I want those so bad!

2312
02:44:49,071 --> 02:44:52,110
TRAVIS: There was a question that said, how much do
you all love Hamilton? Right now, we're all

2313
02:44:52,110 --> 02:44:53,066
obsessed.

2314
02:44:53,066 --> 02:44:54,230
SAM: Have you seen it yet?

2315
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:57,080
LAURA: No, we're going to go! Yeah, we're going to
go visit Ashley and go see.

2316
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:04,254
TALIESIN: I have outtakes from recording today of
Caitlin Glass singing whole chunks of it.

2317
02:45:04,254 --> 02:45:05,400
TRAVIS and LAURA: It's a problem.

2318
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,805
TALIESIN: It's such a problem.

2319
02:45:06,805 --> 02:45:10,401
LAURA: Which class would you have been, Liam, had
you been playing?

2320
02:45:10,401 --> 02:45:11,503
TRAVIS: Oh, good question!

2321
02:45:11,503 --> 02:45:17,422
LIAM: I don't know. Probably still a rogue. I
think that's what I would lean towards.

2322
02:45:17,422 --> 02:45:19,892
LAURA: We would have been twinsie rogues again.

2323
02:45:19,892 --> 02:45:22,677
LIAM: Hide and fucking stab when no one's looking and
then just hide and hide and hide.

2324
02:45:22,677 --> 02:45:26,518
TALIESIN: Weirdly, I would have thrown out wizard.
I'm surprised. I would have pegged wizard.

2325
02:45:26,588 --> 02:45:28,219
LIAM: Yeah, I like wizards, too.

2326
02:45:28,219 --> 02:45:31,193
TRAVIS: Sam, how much time do you spend on your
goblet?

2327
02:45:31,193 --> 02:45:39,128
SAM: How much time do I spend on my goblet? I
spend one minute before the episode gluing

2328
02:45:39,128 --> 02:45:44,412
something to the bottom, and it's whatever I can
find lying around that day.

2329
02:45:44,412 --> 02:45:51,216
TRAVIS: Do you guys jump on the shipping bandwagon
or is it completely weird for you? We just watch.

2330
02:45:51,216 --> 02:45:53,238
We just watch and admire.

2331
02:45:53,238 --> 02:45:54,741
LAURA: Watch the shipping?

2332
02:45:54,741 --> 02:46:01,401
TALIESIN: It's like coming across coyotes in the
wild. I'm so happy to see it and I don't want to

2333
02:46:01,401 --> 02:46:03,624
call attention to it, either. It's awesome.

2334
02:46:03,624 --> 02:46:08,524
LAURA: I favorite a lot of drawings because I love
looking at art of it.

2335
02:46:08,524 --> 02:46:10,821
TRAVIS: We are not seeing Hamilton before Lin
leaves.

2336
02:46:10,821 --> 02:46:12,777
LAURA: No, we're not!

2337
02:46:12,777 --> 02:46:17,128
TRAVIS: Who is more useful, Bixby or Trinket?

2338
02:46:17,128 --> 02:46:24,872
SAM: (giggles) Not a fair question. Neither are
useful. They are just energy sucks.

2339
02:46:24,872 --> 02:46:29,426
LAURA: We did have a conversation out during the
break about how hard it is to have an animal

2340
02:46:29,426 --> 02:46:30,407
companion!

2341
02:46:30,407 --> 02:46:36,209
SAM: I have a newfound respect for Laura, having
just played a beastmaster ranger. It's tough to

2342
02:46:36,209 --> 02:46:41,758
have this stupid animal around all the time that
you have to deal with who can't really do anything

2343
02:46:41,758 --> 02:46:43,445
and could die at any minute!

2344
02:46:43,445 --> 02:46:47,091
LAURA: Who is really cute and you want to protect
it. But you want to take advantage of the fact

2345
02:46:47,091 --> 02:46:48,389
that you have it.

2346
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:50,200
SAM: I know! But it's hard to do that.

2347
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:51,465
LAURA: I know!

2348
02:46:51,465 --> 02:46:55,636
SAM: I have a newfound respect for you. I still
don't like Trinket.

2349
02:46:55,636 --> 02:47:00,895
LAURA: At least you could pick up Bixby. Like,
back in the day when we had to walk around with

2350
02:47:00,895 --> 02:47:01,776
Trinket.

2351
02:47:01,776 --> 02:47:03,757
TALIESIN: But now you've got the Pokeball, though.
The Pokeball's great.

2352
02:47:03,757 --> 02:47:08,360
TRAVIS: Critical Role the Musical's still a ways
off. It's still under development. It's following

2353
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:10,661
the Lin-Manuel thing. It's a seven-year timeline.

2354
02:47:10,661 --> 02:47:12,590
LAURA: Travis, you are my favorite!

2355
02:47:12,590 --> 02:47:15,473
TRAVIS: Started my own goliath barbarian. You're
welcome.

2356
02:47:15,473 --> 02:47:19,394
SAM: Question. Who does Pike like?

2357
02:47:19,394 --> 02:47:21,935
LAURA: Like we can answer that!

2358
02:47:21,935 --> 02:47:23,151
SAM: We don't know!

2359
02:47:23,151 --> 02:47:24,185
LAURA: I know!

2360
02:47:24,185 --> 02:47:25,486
SAM: You know?!

2361
02:47:25,486 --> 02:47:26,693
LAURA: I know!

2362
02:47:26,693 --> 02:47:28,689
SAM: How do you know? Because Ashley told you or
because Pike told you?

2363
02:47:28,689 --> 02:47:29,989
LAURA: Because Ashley told me.

2364
02:47:29,989 --> 02:47:31,397
LIAM: Well, I was in that conversation, too.

2365
02:47:31,397 --> 02:47:32,912
LAURA: Yeah, but I knew <i>before</i>.

2366
02:47:32,912 --> 02:47:38,767
TALIESIN: She's been bragging that she's known for
a while now, too, and she just lords it over us.

2367
02:47:38,767 --> 02:47:44,086
LAURA: There was a question that I talked over,
wasn't there?

2368
02:47:44,086 --> 02:47:47,648
TRAVIS: Oh, it said, if you guys get the airship,
who would be the captain and what positions would

2369
02:47:47,648 --> 02:47:48,837
you man?

2370
02:47:48,837 --> 02:47:51,516
SAM: On the airship? You're the captain.

2371
02:47:51,516 --> 02:47:55,574
TALIESIN: I want to be Teddy Ruxpin, so you can be
the little caterpillar dude who follows him

2372
02:47:55,574 --> 02:47:56,776
around all the time.

2373
02:47:56,776 --> 02:47:57,677
SAM and LAURA: What?

2374
02:47:57,677 --> 02:47:58,978
TALIESIN: Do you not know your Tiddy-- Teddy
Ruxpin, motherfuckers?

2375
02:47:58,978 --> 02:48:00,660
LAURA: Your Titty? Your Titty Ruxpin?

2376
02:48:00,660 --> 02:48:03,130
SAM: Titty Ruxpin is the worst porn, by the way.

2377
02:48:03,130 --> 02:48:06,849
TALIESIN: You just don't like it because of
bears.

2378
02:48:06,849 --> 02:48:11,485
SAM: I would be cabin boy. Wait, is that what we
established? You're cabin boy or I'm cabin boy?

2379
02:48:11,485 --> 02:48:13,147
I'm cabin boy, and you're the captain.

2380
02:48:13,147 --> 02:48:15,641
TALIESIN: I'm first mate, and then we all take
turns being the captain.

2381
02:48:15,641 --> 02:48:23,098
LIAM: Somebody asked if Vax knew that Gilmore
wasn't Gilmore when he stabbed him. And I did

2382
02:48:23,098 --> 02:48:31,713
think that it was somebody else before because his
voice dropped and he became very unGilmore-like. I

2383
02:48:31,713 --> 02:48:36,247
didn't immediately think rakshasa. I just didn't
think it was Gilmore.

2384
02:48:36,247 --> 02:48:38,026
LAURA: I thought it was a demon.

2385
02:48:38,026 --> 02:48:45,985
TALIESIN: Matt does a thing with his voice, and he
did that thing that night. Someone asked, will you

2386
02:48:45,985 --> 02:48:51,632
ever use Diplomacy again? Yeah, it's just really
complicated because in order to use it, I have to

2387
02:48:51,632 --> 02:48:58,543
get hit by lightning, and inevitably that's going
to happen and that's a wonderful counter to being

2388
02:48:58,543 --> 02:49:01,570
hit by lightning at the moment until I can sit
down and do something to it.

2389
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:08,788
SAM: Someone wants to know, Travis, what class
were you in the game we just played?

2390
02:49:08,788 --> 02:49:12,917
TRAVIS: I was a fighter. Not a paladin or a
barbarian, but a fighter.

2391
02:49:12,917 --> 02:49:15,213
LAURA and SAM: Fighter.

2392
02:49:15,213 --> 02:49:26,182
LAURA: Oh! I saw the question, what level were we
when we all started the game? We were all level

2393
02:49:26,182 --> 02:49:27,567
one when we started.

2394
02:49:27,567 --> 02:49:30,167
TRAVIS: And we lived! We lived!

2395
02:49:30,167 --> 02:49:33,323
LAURA: Matt was very kind to us when we first
started playing.

2396
02:49:33,323 --> 02:49:35,908
TALIESIN: We fought a lot of bandits, if I recall.
There were a lot of bandits.

2397
02:49:35,908 --> 02:49:38,879
LAURA: People springing when we were trying to
help people. Jumping out of wagons.

2398
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:42,871
TALIESIN: A lot of bar fights and people
threatening us with mugs.

2399
02:49:42,871 --> 02:49:47,522
LAURA: Question. Does Grog have any love
interests?

2400
02:49:47,522 --> 02:49:48,688
TRAVIS: He does.

2401
02:49:48,688 --> 02:49:50,396
LAURA: (gasps) He does?!

2402
02:49:50,396 --> 02:49:55,293
TRAVIS: Yeah. It all comes from a beer mug. Or one
of his appendages.

2403
02:49:55,293 --> 02:49:58,510
TALIESIN: There's a whorehouse in Westruun.

2404
02:49:58,510 --> 02:50:01,524
TRAVIS: Grog's got too much love to single it out
for one person.

2405
02:50:01,524 --> 02:50:02,999
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's cool.

2406
02:50:02,999 --> 02:50:06,175
LIAM: Someone asked if what they saw-- this is
related to the earlier question-- if what they saw

2407
02:50:06,175 --> 02:50:14,930
was the average day in a voice actor. I mean, we
hammed it up, but sure. Sessions, a free morning

2408
02:50:14,930 --> 02:50:21,679
working out and then going to a session, or two
sessions. Sam directing and rushing over

2409
02:50:21,679 --> 02:50:22,918
somewhere.

2410
02:50:22,918 --> 02:50:25,046
LAURA: Sam, not having any time, ever.

2411
02:50:25,046 --> 02:50:27,272
TRAVIS: Liam, would you hire me as a voice actor?

2412
02:50:27,272 --> 02:50:30,781
LIAM: You could be a serial killer. I don't know.

2413
02:50:30,781 --> 02:50:32,952
TRAVIS: No, that was a question from the chat.

2414
02:50:32,952 --> 02:50:38,086
LIAM: Oh. I know that. I know it was. Yeah, if you 
wind up in front of me and audition. The truth is,

2415
02:50:38,086 --> 02:50:42,755
when I direct, I don't do much casting. I do a
little bit. I do some suggesting, but most of the

2416
02:50:42,755 --> 02:50:45,748
casting comes from elsewhere, and I direct who
shows up in front of me.

2417
02:50:45,748 --> 02:50:49,638
TRAVIS, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Pick up!

2418
02:50:49,638 --> 02:50:52,544
SAM: I do not say pick up in my real life.

2419
02:50:52,544 --> 02:50:54,792
TALIESIN: We were talking about that.

2420
02:50:54,792 --> 02:50:58,746
LAURA: If anybody said that, I don't know if I'd
be able to handle it in a session if they did what

2421
02:50:58,746 --> 02:50:59,862
you did.

2422
02:50:59,862 --> 02:51:00,922
SAM: Pick up!

2423
02:51:00,922 --> 02:51:03,987
LAURA: Pick up! I'm sorry, pick up! Pick up! I
would die.

2424
02:51:03,987 --> 02:51:07,738
LIAM: I've heard that. Not 90 times in a row, but
I've heard someone say pick up.

2425
02:51:07,738 --> 02:51:10,961
TRAVIS: Laura, do you think stealing the broom was
enough to change alignments?

2426
02:51:10,961 --> 02:51:11,992
LAURA: No!

2427
02:51:11,992 --> 02:51:13,438
TALIESIN: It's a broom, people!

2428
02:51:13,438 --> 02:51:20,421
LAURA: It's a broom, damn it! And here's the
thing, here's my thing about the alignment. I was

2429
02:51:20,421 --> 02:51:28,031
neutral good, stealing a lowly little broom, and
I'm going to say that I did not realize, because

2430
02:51:28,031 --> 02:51:32,297
I've never played this game outside of our game,
that if you stole something from another player,

2431
02:51:32,297 --> 02:51:34,062
it was a bad thing.

2432
02:51:34,062 --> 02:51:36,992
SAM: I didn't know stealing was bad!

2433
02:51:36,992 --> 02:51:41,861
LAURA: No, but I just thought it was funny. Some
people say it's a no-no to steal from other

2434
02:51:41,861 --> 02:51:45,090
players. I didn't know that because he was coming
on and it was funny, and it was a fun thing.

2435
02:51:45,090 --> 02:51:49,050
TALIESIN: We've all stolen shit from Chris
Hardwick, at this point. What's the big fucking deal?

2436
02:51:49,050 --> 02:51:54,908
LIAM: Plus, we're coming at this as actors doing
an improv show. Almost anything is game.

2437
02:51:54,908 --> 02:52:02,367
LAURA: Exactly! So I just thought it was funny.
But Vex, for the most part, has very good

2438
02:52:02,367 --> 02:52:08,974
intentions for everything that she does. So if
anything, I should have dropped to just neutral,

2439
02:52:08,974 --> 02:52:11,271
or is there such a thing as chaotic good?

2440
02:52:11,271 --> 02:52:13,133
TALIESIN: Yeah! I'm chaotic good!

2441
02:52:13,133 --> 02:52:16,664
LAURA: I feel like that's what I should have been,
but straight-up chaotic neutral, I feel like was

2442
02:52:16,664 --> 02:52:22,850
dropped two levels of alignment, which I think was
wrong. I have talked to Matt about it afterward,

2443
02:52:22,850 --> 02:52:32,389
because I feel like for where she is in her head
for her to be that alignment. I'm a little worked

2444
02:52:32,389 --> 02:52:33,757
up about it.

2445
02:52:33,757 --> 02:52:38,158
TRAVIS: Liam, did it go better than you expected?
Were you nervous DMing for your friends, and would

2446
02:52:38,158 --> 02:52:40,051
you be open to doing it again?

2447
02:52:40,051 --> 02:52:42,399
LIAM: Yeah, I would do it again. I don't want to
do it all the time, because it's a lot of work,

2448
02:52:42,399 --> 02:52:46,227
and with two kids and my work schedule, I'm pretty
crazed.

2449
02:52:46,227 --> 02:52:51,730
TALIESIN: I may take one. You've made me feel like
I could maybe do it.

2450
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:56,782
LIAM: I will say, I was very anxious about it in
the leadup, but five minutes into it, I was having

2451
02:52:56,782 --> 02:53:00,838
a blast, I didn't care, wasn't worried about what
I was going to say. Beforehand, I was like, "I'm

2452
02:53:00,838 --> 02:53:03,941
"going to fuck it up. Am I going to say that at the
right time?" Totally didn't matter, didn't care,

2453
02:53:03,941 --> 02:53:05,175
it was just fun.

2454
02:53:05,175 --> 02:53:06,275
LAURA: You were great, Liam.

2455
02:53:06,275 --> 02:53:07,681
LIAM: Thanks, man.

2456
02:53:07,681 --> 02:53:11,645
TRAVIS: We are totally looking forward to the live
show, by the way. Anybody that can join us will

2457
02:53:11,645 --> 02:53:12,589
join us.

2458
02:53:12,589 --> 02:53:18,109
LAURA: Are there still tickets? Is it still up? Go
check out the link, man!

2459
02:53:18,109 --> 02:53:21,785
TRAVIS: We hope to do that and much more, so
hopefully, it'll be a good starting point.

2460
02:53:21,785 --> 02:53:23,499
TALIESIN: People want to send you money.

2461
02:53:23,499 --> 02:53:25,006
SAM: Why do people want to send me money?

2462
02:53:25,006 --> 02:53:26,450
TRAVIS: It's on the bottom of your--

2463
02:53:26,450 --> 02:53:27,851
SAM: Oh. Oh yeah.

2464
02:53:27,851 --> 02:53:30,889
TRAVIS: It's on the bottom of your damn tankard.

2465
02:53:30,889 --> 02:53:37,270
TALIESIN: If I DM, it won't be DND, though. It'll
be something else, guys. If I DM a game, it's

2466
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:38,760
not going to be DND.

2467
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:44,428
LAURA: That's awesome. Can you show everybody your
picture from prom because I just love it so much.

2468
02:53:44,428 --> 02:53:54,803
TALIESIN: I will repost the professional
photograph from prom. I have to ask if I can.

2469
02:53:54,803 --> 02:53:58,603
TRAVIS: Not a question. Tickets were gone in
minutes.

2470
02:53:58,603 --> 02:54:00,296
LAURA: Oh, were they?

2471
02:54:00,296 --> 02:54:05,286
TALIESIN: The site may have been down, so check
later. I do know we broke the site.

2472
02:54:05,286 --> 02:54:08,688
TRAVIS: Sometimes it breaks, yeah. What was Craven
Edge's full stats?

2473
02:54:08,688 --> 02:54:18,213
SAM: This guy says 50 or so tickets remain. 11 VIP
and 56 general tickets remain.

2474
02:54:18,213 --> 02:54:20,228
TALIESIN: Tickets are still available!

2475
02:54:20,228 --> 02:54:27,221
LIAM: My hipster rakshasa shirt comes from
Threadless.com. A bunch of people asked.

2476
02:54:27,221 --> 02:54:39,803
TALIESIN: No, if I do a game, it's probably, and I
don't want to confirm it: Tabletop Vampire was a big

2477
02:54:39,803 --> 02:54:42,319
thing when I was a teenager. I really like
Tabletop Vampire.

2478
02:54:42,319 --> 02:54:43,824
LIAM: Is it a complicated system?

2479
02:54:43,824 --> 02:54:45,224
TALIESIN: It's very simple.

2480
02:54:45,224 --> 02:54:49,271
TRAVIS: This is a good question for a bunch of
nerds. Favorite musical besides Hamilton?

2481
02:54:49,271 --> 02:54:51,613
LAURA and TALIESIN: Ever?

2482
02:54:51,613 --> 02:54:56,843
SAM: Les Mis, but there's other ones that are
good, too.

2483
02:54:56,843 --> 02:55:00,890
TALIESIN: I really like the Reefer Madness musical
from a few years ago. It was really funny.

2484
02:55:00,890 --> 02:55:06,721
TRAVIS: My first love was Phantom. Yeah, it was
fifth grade.

2485
02:55:06,721 --> 02:55:13,122
LAURA: It was the first musical I ever saw. Seeing
Phantom of the Opera is what made me want to be an

2486
02:55:13,122 --> 02:55:14,241
actor.

2487
02:55:14,241 --> 02:55:19,508
TALIESIN: The first musical I went to see was Tom
Daley's Gypsy in LA. That was amazing.

2488
02:55:19,508 --> 02:55:23,837
LIAM: I saw a college production of Jesus Christ
Superstar when I was 13 and it got me very

2489
02:55:23,837 --> 02:55:25,431
interested in acting.

2490
02:55:25,431 --> 02:55:27,889
TRAVIS: I would say, besides Hamilton, it's Once
for me.

2491
02:55:27,889 --> 02:55:30,211
LAURA: Once was so good!

2492
02:55:30,211 --> 02:55:34,068
SAM and TALIESIN: Book of Mormon.

2493
02:55:34,068 --> 02:55:36,982
LIAM: Spring Awakening and Fun Home are in heavy
rotation.

2494
02:55:36,982 --> 02:55:44,898
TALIESIN: The reboot of Cabaret they did with Alan
Cummings was pretty spectacular. I got to see that

2495
02:55:44,898 --> 02:55:47,126
in New York a few years ago.

2496
02:55:47,126 --> 02:55:50,915
TRAVIS: Would you be able to survive in the world
that Liam just created as yourselves?

2497
02:55:50,915 --> 02:55:52,306
LAURA: No! Hell no!

2498
02:55:52,306 --> 02:55:54,908
TALIESIN: My parents did a number on me. I think
I'd be okay.

2499
02:55:54,908 --> 02:55:58,194
LAURA: I would hide. I wouldn't have gone out
anywhere, really.

2500
02:55:58,194 --> 02:56:03,263
TALIESIN: My parents assumed I was gonna usher in the
apocalypse. They're still waiting for it, really.

2501
02:56:03,263 --> 02:56:07,978
SAM: Was there anything on your character sheets
tonight that you did not get to do, but wish you

2502
02:56:07,978 --> 02:56:09,327
had done?

2503
02:56:09,327 --> 02:56:11,029
TRAVIS: I was trying to kill Sam.

2504
02:56:11,029 --> 02:56:13,134
SAM: That wasn't on your sheet, was it?

2505
02:56:13,134 --> 02:56:16,845
TRAVIS: Look at it! It was at the bottom of the
sheet. Liam wrote it in!

2506
02:56:16,845 --> 02:56:19,048
LIAM: What?

2507
02:56:19,048 --> 02:56:21,366
TRAVIS: Roll for deception check!

2508
02:56:21,366 --> 02:56:25,539
TALIESIN: I had Hellish Rebuke, and I didn't get
to use Hellish Rebuke.

2509
02:56:25,539 --> 02:56:27,848
TRAVIS: I didn't use Second Wind.

2510
02:56:27,848 --> 02:56:32,820
LAURA: I didn't have anything. I had a dagger.
That's all I could do. You're right, being a rogue

2511
02:56:32,820 --> 02:56:34,065
is lame.

2512
02:56:34,065 --> 02:56:38,020
LIAM: Well, if you're a human being in a t-shirt
with nothing on you, it's kind of rough.

2513
02:56:38,020 --> 02:56:42,553
SAM: I have favored terrain of voiceover booths
and I didn't get to use it.

2514
02:56:42,553 --> 02:56:45,758
TRAVIS: Are there any hashtag questions?

2515
02:56:45,758 --> 02:56:48,341
SAM: From the Twitter?

2516
02:56:48,341 --> 02:56:51,024
LAURA: We told you to do it, and then we didn't
even look.

2517
02:56:51,024 --> 02:56:57,138
SAM: Checking it out. #CriticalOBrien tag. Here we
go. Question. If your character could get the kill

2518
02:56:57,138 --> 02:57:03,118
on any one of the dragons, which one would you
want it to be on and why?

2519
02:57:03,118 --> 02:57:08,507
LAURA: I just saw a thing saying did we have a
baby. We didn't have a baby.

2520
02:57:08,507 --> 02:57:11,134
TALIESIN: That's the dog.

2521
02:57:11,134 --> 02:57:14,798
LAURA: We have a dog named Charlie, but no
babies.

2522
02:57:14,798 --> 02:57:24,870
TRAVIS: Very hairy baby. Hairy baby! I would kill
the green dragon.

2523
02:57:24,870 --> 02:57:30,185
SAM: Wait, green dragon's the dickish one, right?

2524
02:57:30,185 --> 02:57:32,827
TRAVIS: Yeah. Actually, we want to turn him to our
side.

2525
02:57:32,827 --> 02:57:37,006
TALIESIN: I'm excited about all the fancy armor we
can now make with black and white scales because

2526
02:57:37,006 --> 02:57:38,498
we have black and white scales.

2527
02:57:38,498 --> 02:57:43,996
LIAM: I'd like to ask this question from
@KatyKreation. For Travis. What the hell, dude?

2528
02:57:43,996 --> 02:57:46,379
SAM: That's a great question.

2529
02:57:46,379 --> 02:57:52,058
TRAVIS: I mean, I can't really answer that at
once, it's a complicated question. But if you stay

2530
02:57:52,058 --> 02:57:55,103
tuned every Thursday at 7:00pm, you might learn
the answer.

2531
02:57:55,103 --> 02:57:57,284
TALIESIN: Did the t-shirt contest stuff get moved
to next week?

2532
02:57:57,284 --> 02:57:59,519
LIAM: The t-shirt contest did get moved to next
week.

2533
02:57:59,519 --> 02:58:03,821
SAM: There's so many great submissions that we
could not sort through them all this week, so

2534
02:58:03,821 --> 02:58:05,922
we're moving it to next week.

2535
02:58:05,922 --> 02:58:10,631
LAURA: Plus, we wanted Matt and Marisha to be here
when we announce the winner.

2536
02:58:10,631 --> 02:58:14,635
SAM: There's some amazing designs!

2537
02:58:14,635 --> 02:58:19,623
LAURA: They're so good! I am not pregnant!

2538
02:58:19,623 --> 02:58:22,154
TRAVIS: Those are different voice actors.

2539
02:58:22,154 --> 02:58:25,284
SAM: What are all these baby questions for?

2540
02:58:25,284 --> 02:58:26,608
LAURA: I don't know!

2541
02:58:26,608 --> 02:58:34,048
TALIESIN: Do you all agree with the stats that
Liam gave you? I felt highly complimented on mine.

2542
02:58:34,048 --> 02:58:37,088
SAM: I disagreed completely.

2543
02:58:37,088 --> 02:58:38,851
LAURA: I pretty much agreed.

2544
02:58:38,851 --> 02:58:41,361
SAM: He was so good. Great job prepping, Liam!

2545
02:58:41,361 --> 02:58:45,268
TRAVIS: There was a good question that said, does
doing so much VO in video games decrease or

2546
02:58:45,268 --> 02:58:49,299
increase your enjoyment of playing them? Sam, this
is a question for you.

2547
02:58:49,299 --> 02:58:56,822
SAM: It's similar to if you watch a lot of porn,
does that desensitize you to--

2548
02:58:56,822 --> 02:59:00,860
TRAVIS: Or, if you do a lot of porn, would you
watch it when you're getting off?

2549
02:59:00,860 --> 02:59:02,818
SAM: I think the answer's yes.

2550
02:59:02,818 --> 02:59:10,637
LIAM: Someone has asked, was the Liam in the
recording studio the real Liam, or was there a

2551
02:59:10,637 --> 02:59:15,811
Liam mastermind somewhere? I would say, in my
imagination, it was the real Liam.

2552
02:59:15,811 --> 02:59:17,549
LAURA: And you really got pulled apart.

2553
02:59:17,549 --> 02:59:21,434
LIAM: And I got pulled apart and set off a chain
of Liam duplication.

2554
02:59:21,434 --> 02:59:23,527
SAM: Why did Conan choose you?

2555
02:59:23,527 --> 02:59:25,220
LIAM: That I can't answer.

2556
02:59:25,220 --> 02:59:27,156
SAM: You can answer that?

2557
02:59:27,156 --> 02:59:31,402
LAURA: When we were killing little baby Liams, was
your brain in them?

2558
02:59:31,402 --> 02:59:32,659
LIAM: A fragment, yeah.

2559
02:59:32,659 --> 02:59:36,569
LAURA: Oh no! That makes me feel so sad!

2560
02:59:36,569 --> 02:59:39,121
TALIESIN: Just sleep!

2561
02:59:39,121 --> 02:59:42,341
TRAVIS: To answer your question, we do love
playing the video games.

2562
02:59:42,341 --> 02:59:48,864
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do start to recognize voices
and listen for things. You get a little bit of the

2563
02:59:48,864 --> 02:59:55,019
tech brain, but other than that, it's really fun.
It's one of the reasons I'm enjoying Overwatch is

2564
02:59:55,019 --> 02:59:58,181
that I barely recognize anyone, which both makes
me sad and happy.

2565
02:59:58,181 --> 03:00:04,552
TRAVIS: Meet and Greet will be for VIP tickets at
the live thing. I saw that one.

2566
03:00:04,552 --> 03:00:08,009
LAURA: I can't read this fast!

2567
03:00:08,009 --> 03:00:11,401
TALIESIN: I just saw the new Shadowrun book. I
don't know if I'm up for that.

2568
03:00:11,401 --> 03:00:15,836
SAM: How's this going to work? We do the show, and
then the VIPs can stick around after the show?

2569
03:00:15,836 --> 03:00:18,898
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's going to be a 30 minute Q
and A afterwards, and then we'll have a short

2570
03:00:18,898 --> 03:00:24,722
meet and greet backstage where people can shake hands,
get stuff signed.

2571
03:00:24,722 --> 03:00:28,486
SAM: Wow! This is going to be so much fun! Do I
get to wear makeup on stage?

2572
03:00:28,486 --> 03:00:35,787
TRAVIS: I think the VIP seats are the first three
rows of the theater. We had to have some sweet

2573
03:00:35,787 --> 03:00:41,976
internet signal for tech reasons, so we're doing
it in a movie theater with stadium seating. We're

2574
03:00:41,976 --> 03:00:45,809
going to have a stage on the floor while we
project it on the movie screen. It'll be great.

2575
03:00:45,809 --> 03:00:47,145
LAURA: I like that it's stadium seating.

2576
03:00:47,145 --> 03:00:51,503
SAM: And if it doesn't go well, they can put Civil
War up and everyone gets a nice show.

2577
03:00:51,503 --> 03:00:52,779
TRAVIS: We'll narrate it.

2578
03:00:52,779 --> 03:00:57,308
LAURA: I like that it's a small theater because
I'm afraid I would get so nervous if there was a

2579
03:00:57,308 --> 03:00:58,338
lot of people.

2580
03:00:58,338 --> 03:01:00,844
TRAVIS: What is the scariest moment for you so far
in the Critical Role campaign?

2581
03:01:00,844 --> 03:01:02,528
LAURA: Scariest moment?

2582
03:01:02,528 --> 03:01:06,395
SAM: Matt does some scares in every episode.

2583
03:01:06,395 --> 03:01:10,958
TRAVIS: I would say, I didn't want to die by
Kevdak's hand, I thought that was going to happen.

2584
03:01:10,958 --> 03:01:17,964
I would almost be okay with dying at any other
moment, I just didn't want to die at that point.

2585
03:01:17,964 --> 03:01:20,509
TALIESIN: That was the most scared the group has
ever been.

2586
03:01:20,509 --> 03:01:23,845
LAURA: Going into the Kevdak fight? I think we
realized too late--

2587
03:01:23,845 --> 03:01:25,210
SAM: We should not have done that.

2588
03:01:25,210 --> 03:01:27,221
TALIESIN: We bit off way more than we could chew.

2589
03:01:27,221 --> 03:01:29,094
TRAVIS: It was great for the story.

2590
03:01:29,094 --> 03:01:30,531
TALIESIN: It was great.

2591
03:01:30,531 --> 03:01:34,510
SAM: There was a question-- shit, I've already
forgotten it.

2592
03:01:34,510 --> 03:01:40,350
LIAM: I think the most recent was the worst for
me, being up there with the rakshasa. It felt like

2593
03:01:40,350 --> 03:01:47,879
getting hit by a bus. It felt like I was out of my
control. Shit just creamed me. I felt like Matt

2594
03:01:47,879 --> 03:01:53,709
totally fucking hoodwinked me, and it emotionally
fucked me up for a few days.

2595
03:01:53,709 --> 03:01:58,241
LAURA: Plus, and then when we started, I was like,
okay, we've got to get to Liam, we've just got to get to

2596
03:01:58,241 --> 03:02:02,178
Liam. And then he throws those assassins in. I was
not expecting that.

2597
03:02:02,230 --> 03:02:07,897
SAM: Yeah, and I got to Liam and he jumped off the
fucking ledge out of range of all of my spells and

2598
03:02:07,897 --> 03:02:10,688
any help I could have given!

2599
03:02:10,688 --> 03:02:13,346
LIAM: Setting you up for that amazing moment and
jumping out!

2600
03:02:13,346 --> 03:02:15,259
LAURA: If you would have rolled a one--

2601
03:02:15,259 --> 03:02:17,076
TALIESIN: That would have been very sad.

2602
03:02:17,076 --> 03:02:19,147
TRAVIS: Will we dress as our characters at the
live show?

2603
03:02:19,147 --> 03:02:21,447
LAURA: At the live show?! Oh man.

2604
03:02:21,447 --> 03:02:26,700
TRAVIS: We only wear those outfits on the weekends
when we have parties with each other.

2605
03:02:26,700 --> 03:02:30,911
TALIESIN: I wear mine in the hot tub. Just my
jacket.

2606
03:02:30,911 --> 03:02:32,761
TRAVIS: Let's take a couple more. We've got a
couple more minutes.

2607
03:02:32,761 --> 03:02:37,722
SAM: There was one question earlier that said, Laura
and Travis, how did it feel RPing as a couple

2608
03:02:37,722 --> 03:02:38,765
tonight?

2609
03:02:38,765 --> 03:02:43,749
LAURA: I know, because we don't ever have any kind
of romantic stuff.

2610
03:02:43,749 --> 03:02:48,002
TRAVIS: You put our life at great risk often. I
had to chase after you and save you like I do

2611
03:02:48,002 --> 03:02:52,227
every day. It was okay.

2612
03:02:52,227 --> 03:02:54,235
LAURA: Yeah. Felt pretty normal.

2613
03:02:54,235 --> 03:02:56,279
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was proud. That was good, yeah.

2614
03:02:56,279 --> 03:03:00,507
LIAM: I was super curious to see what you guys
would do once you realized you were playing as

2615
03:03:00,507 --> 03:03:03,476
yourselves at the same fucking places you go
everyday.

2616
03:03:03,476 --> 03:03:06,608
TRAVIS: That was good. You mapped out that studio
perfectly.

2617
03:03:06,608 --> 03:03:08,118
TALIESIN: It was amazing.

2618
03:03:08,118 --> 03:03:12,792
LAURA: It was so weird to be at the studio and
know the location and actually be able to

2619
03:03:12,792 --> 03:03:15,352
visualize what you're talking about. It was so
weird.

2620
03:03:15,352 --> 03:03:17,100
TALIESIN: Down to the fruit on the fruit plate.

2621
03:03:17,100 --> 03:03:19,100
LAURA: Yeah! And the brownies!

2622
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:20,637
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, the brownies!

2623
03:03:20,637 --> 03:03:23,335
TRAVIS: Do you ever feel like Mercer is picking on
you?

2624
03:03:23,335 --> 03:03:26,106
LAURA, TALIESIN, and SAM: No.

2625
03:03:26,106 --> 03:03:31,154
SAM: He spreads it out. He attacks everybody
evenly.

2626
03:03:31,154 --> 03:03:33,016
LIAM: He's cold, like the universe. It's fine.

2627
03:03:33,016 --> 03:03:38,603
LAURA: Yeah. I never feel angry, ever. Like, when
we joke and we're like, fuck you, Matt! There's

2628
03:03:38,603 --> 03:03:46,512
never any real anger towards him at all. It's a
joint game and it always feels like he's trying to

2629
03:03:46,512 --> 03:03:47,858
help us.

2630
03:03:47,858 --> 03:03:52,071
TALIESIN: Even between us, we all walk away from
the table during breaks going, (gasps) no matter

2631
03:03:52,071 --> 03:03:53,265
what the fuck was going on.

2632
03:03:53,265 --> 03:03:59,194
TRAVIS: Sam, your old Les Mis audition got posted
on the internet recently. Is there any other old

2633
03:03:59,194 --> 03:04:01,420
work that you would like to see come to light?

2634
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:05,746
SAM: I have a lot of great nuggets from the past.

2635
03:04:05,746 --> 03:04:08,749
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we all have a little bit of
interesting YouTube ephemera.

2636
03:04:08,749 --> 03:04:13,429
SAM: But you and me have some-- we had done some
screen acting as children.

2637
03:04:13,429 --> 03:04:17,420
TALIESIN: They've only found the strawberry so
far, is the only thing they've found of mine. I've

2638
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:18,764
got some other weird shit.

2639
03:04:18,764 --> 03:04:21,348
SAM: I have a Pizza Hut commercial that I'm quite
proud of.

2640
03:04:21,348 --> 03:04:23,978
TRAVIS: I remember that commercial. Where you were
the dweeb, right?

2641
03:04:23,978 --> 03:04:28,062
SAM: Where I was the dweeb. Cousin Norman the
Nerd. Google it now.

2642
03:04:28,062 --> 03:04:32,198
TALIESIN: We did a Close Encounters Coca Cola
commercial back in the day. I had a whole cult

2643
03:04:32,198 --> 03:04:33,781
watching me drink a Coke.

2644
03:04:33,781 --> 03:04:36,303
LAURA: That's awesome. Is that on YouTube?

2645
03:04:36,303 --> 03:04:37,495
TALIESIN: Somewhere. I don't know.

2646
03:04:37,495 --> 03:04:41,570
TRAVIS: Hot Cheeto.

2647
03:04:41,570 --> 03:04:44,023
SAM: Yep, Hot Cheeto's up there. Sure.

2648
03:04:44,023 --> 03:04:48,725
LIAM: Somebody asked, if we die, what are we going
to reroll as. That also reminds me of, when are

2649
03:04:48,725 --> 03:04:52,801
these two characters going to get together? or
when are you doing to this? And at least my answer

2650
03:04:52,801 --> 03:04:57,305
is, never going to tell you because I feel like
that's going up to J.K. Rowling when you haven't

2651
03:04:57,305 --> 03:05:00,894
read anything and saying, what happens at the end
of the final book? We're not going to tell you

2652
03:05:00,894 --> 03:05:06,167
anything that hasn't happened in the future
because we want it to unfold in front of you.

2653
03:05:06,167 --> 03:05:08,058
LAURA: Plus, we don't necessarily know.

2654
03:05:08,058 --> 03:05:15,428
SAM: That is true. We don't know. I had no idea I
had a daughter! I had no idea. That changes all

2655
03:05:15,428 --> 03:05:17,318
kinds of things for my guy.

2656
03:05:17,318 --> 03:05:20,602
LIAM: You can keep sending those tweets, but it's
ultimately going to go down the toilet.

2657
03:05:20,602 --> 03:05:22,578
SAM: I just dumped Pike.

2658
03:05:22,578 --> 03:05:24,696
LAURA: You dumped Pike.

2659
03:05:24,696 --> 03:05:25,806
SAM: I dumped Pike.

2660
03:05:25,806 --> 03:05:28,240
TRAVIS: You broke it off, man! I was shocked!

2661
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:35,155
SAM: Who knew that was going to happen? She was
pretty broken up over it.

2662
03:05:35,155 --> 03:05:39,038
TALIESIN: Girls are pretty in the Feywild, I'm
just saying. That shit's going to go down.

2663
03:05:39,038 --> 03:05:40,992
TRAVIS: Let's take two or three more and we'll
wrap it up.

2664
03:05:40,992 --> 03:05:47,363
LIAM: Hey, how to get into voice acting. Take some
acting classes, go to where the work is. Boom.

2665
03:05:47,363 --> 03:05:48,462
Done. Next.

2666
03:05:48,462 --> 03:05:55,519
SAM: New York Comic Con, are we going back to New
York Comic Con? We went last year.

2667
03:05:55,519 --> 03:05:59,671
TRAVIS: The live game will be streamed, and if the
first live show goes really well, then maybe we

2668
03:05:59,671 --> 03:06:02,742
will make it to other cities for live shows, but
it's super early on.

2669
03:06:02,742 --> 03:06:07,118
TALIESIN: I know, it's too much!

2670
03:06:07,118 --> 03:06:08,476
TRAVIS: VIP is sold out.

2671
03:06:08,476 --> 03:06:10,161
LAURA: It went so fast. Now it's going so fast!

2672
03:06:10,161 --> 03:06:17,205
SAM: Let's start combining them. Do you guys watch
the live show TPK character--

2673
03:06:17,205 --> 03:06:19,831
LIAM: Sam's commercial Pizza Hut. Question.

2674
03:06:19,831 --> 03:06:26,634
LAURA: Who would win in a fight, Stinky Jules or
Percy? And I am pretty damn sure Percy would win.

2675
03:06:26,634 --> 03:06:28,922
TALIESIN: Percy's a vicious son of a bitch.

2676
03:06:28,922 --> 03:06:33,429
LAURA: Stinky Jules is a vicious son of a bitch,
all right? (regular voice) I do think that her

2677
03:06:33,429 --> 03:06:37,910
level is way lower, but she was pretty fucking
cool.

2678
03:06:37,910 --> 03:06:40,500
TALIESIN: I saw about half an hour of it. I
enjoyed it.

2679
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:44,624
TRAVIS: I will never give my allegiance to the
Green Bay Packers.

2680
03:06:44,624 --> 03:06:49,365
SAM: If you could have one thing answered about
the current campaign from Matt Mercer, what would

2681
03:06:49,365 --> 03:06:52,198
it be? What are you dying to know that he hasn't
told us yet?

2682
03:06:52,198 --> 03:06:55,775
TRAVIS: Do the Titanstone Knuckles level up any
higher than they already are?

2683
03:06:55,775 --> 03:06:57,742
TALIESIN: I don't want to know--

2684
03:06:57,742 --> 03:07:03,161
LAURA: Discover it as we're playing it.

2685
03:07:03,161 --> 03:07:15,528
TALIESIN: Maybe it's a thing about working as an
actor that you don't feel that drive to know any more.

2686
03:07:15,528 --> 03:07:18,656
SAM: I feel that drive to know. I want to know
anything.

2687
03:07:18,656 --> 03:07:22,243
TRAVIS: I keep seeing GenCon. We'll just say: stay
tuned.

2688
03:07:22,243 --> 03:07:24,407
TALIESIN: Working on it.

2689
03:07:24,407 --> 03:07:26,509
LAURA: We're working on it.

2690
03:07:26,509 --> 03:07:30,581
TALIESIN: How much is planned and how much is
improv-ed? We never have conversations with Matt

2691
03:07:30,581 --> 03:07:34,470
about what we're going to do, unless we're gonna do
something that he needs to know about.

2692
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:39,670
SAM: Has Matt ever had to crash with one of you
guys because Marisha got mad at him after a game?

2693
03:07:39,670 --> 03:07:45,382
LIAM: I've seen that a thousand times on the
internet.

2694
03:07:45,382 --> 03:07:52,780
LAURA: There was a point when we were all talking
about what we were going to do in the Kevdak

2695
03:07:52,780 --> 03:07:59,658
fight, where we were like, can we technically do
this? and Marisha was like, hold on, and she got

2696
03:07:59,658 --> 03:08:04,745
up and walked in the other room and then came
back. We were on Facetime with each other. She was

2697
03:08:04,745 --> 03:08:07,313
like, Matt says you technically can't do that.

2698
03:08:07,313 --> 03:08:15,153
TALIESIN: No. Other than using the shower a couple
times when the water wasn't functioning, that's

2699
03:08:15,153 --> 03:08:17,638
pretty much.

2700
03:08:17,638 --> 03:08:21,245
TRAVIS: I keep seeing this one. I don't always
play a warrior type in video games. I get to play

2701
03:08:21,245 --> 03:08:25,050
various other things. We all get to stretch every
once in a while.

2702
03:08:25,050 --> 03:08:28,134
LAURA: That was a total joke. Travis plays all
sorts of types.

2703
03:08:28,134 --> 03:08:31,245
TRAVIS: Yeah. Was there a joke earlier? Did
somebody joke?

2704
03:08:31,245 --> 03:08:32,534
LAURA: When he was joking about how--

2705
03:08:32,534 --> 03:08:34,231
SAM: Am I a joke to you?

2706
03:08:34,231 --> 03:08:36,419
TRAVIS: Am I a joke right now?

2707
03:08:36,419 --> 03:08:39,084
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, we're all rangey.

2708
03:08:39,084 --> 03:08:46,196
LAURA: Last question. It better be a good one, you
guys. Why hasn't Scanlan's daughter smelled the

2709
03:08:46,196 --> 03:08:47,717
poo note and taken it out?

2710
03:08:47,717 --> 03:08:49,709
SAM: That is <i>not</i> a good question to end on.

2711
03:08:49,709 --> 03:08:51,353
LAURA: Who knows, she might've!

2712
03:08:51,353 --> 03:08:58,994
TRAVIS: What's it like living with a dragon?
Dangerous. Keep her fed and let her sleep.

2713
03:08:58,994 --> 03:09:01,510
LAURA: Who asked that question?!

2714
03:09:01,510 --> 03:09:08,141
TRAVIS: Do you have any character regrets you wish
you could do over? That's a good one, yeah.

2715
03:09:08,141 --> 03:09:09,665
That'll be the last one.

2716
03:09:09,665 --> 03:09:11,503
SAM: Man, so many.

2717
03:09:11,503 --> 03:09:12,889
TRAVIS: There have been a couple, yeah.

2718
03:09:12,889 --> 03:09:14,707
SAM: Trying to bone my daughter.

2719
03:09:14,707 --> 03:09:19,225
LAURA: Yeah, that one was pretty bad.

2720
03:09:19,225 --> 03:09:20,816
SAM: That's a good one.

2721
03:09:20,816 --> 03:09:25,250
TALIESIN: Individual regrets, Percy doesn't
believe in them. He just believes in good life

2722
03:09:25,250 --> 03:09:31,492
lessons. Other than the regret of his existence,
he's pretty down. It's like, once you've fucked up

2723
03:09:31,492 --> 03:09:33,435
that hard, everything else is just whatever.

2724
03:09:33,435 --> 03:09:37,342
TRAVIS: As long as you're still alive, there's no
looming regrets. But there have been after the

2725
03:09:37,342 --> 03:09:43,528
immediate game moments where you're like, oh, if I'd
just done this instead, I was thinking of it and I

2726
03:09:43,528 --> 03:09:44,674
pussed out.

2727
03:09:44,674 --> 03:09:49,545
TALIESIN: I loved our fight, and I'm sad it never
got to see its inevitable conclusion. The

2728
03:09:49,545 --> 03:09:54,807
conversation we had in the craft room afterward
was possibly the most satisfying.

2729
03:09:54,807 --> 03:09:57,579
TRAVIS: We jumped into a big hug afterwards.

2730
03:09:57,579 --> 03:10:01,886
TALIESIN: Do you remember? You were like, okay,
what would have happened if I had put my hand in

2731
03:10:01,886 --> 03:10:04,025
the shadow. You were like, what would have
happened?

2732
03:10:04,025 --> 03:10:07,965
LAURA: You would have realized it was all an
illusion.

2733
03:10:07,965 --> 03:10:09,942
TALIESIN: Had the skull in your hand.

2734
03:10:09,942 --> 03:10:16,534
LAURA: I think my biggest regret is that I
couldn't bring Vax out of his sadness that he was

2735
03:10:16,534 --> 03:10:23,193
feeling. As a sister, I wasn't able to-- I
couldn't bring him out like no Raven Queen could!

2736
03:10:23,193 --> 03:10:25,441
That made me sad.

2737
03:10:25,441 --> 03:10:30,100
LIAM: I'm not sure if that's a regret, but that
moment. A lot of shit and talk from the fans and a

2738
03:10:30,100 --> 03:10:35,804
lot of what I thought about swirling around that
moment with the Raven Queen. That was a huge deal

2739
03:10:35,804 --> 03:10:40,089
for me in the game because what I thought was
doing in that split second was bowing out as Vax

2740
03:10:40,089 --> 03:10:44,556
so that Vex could continue. That's what I was doing. I
wasn't angling for the armor, I wasn't trying to

2741
03:10:44,556 --> 03:10:50,736
get a cool story. I was like, what I've always
said is that Vax dies for Vex and I'm going to die now

2742
03:10:50,736 --> 03:10:54,990
and Laura will get to keep playing this character
and I'll come back as a fill-in-the-blank. And

2743
03:10:54,990 --> 03:11:02,993
fucking Mercer spins everything all over the place
and it wasn't what I wanted, and Vax did want to

2744
03:11:02,993 --> 03:11:13,481
follow Sarenrae, and he was in love, and becoming
the right hand man of the fucking Cryptkeeper made

2745
03:11:13,481 --> 03:11:19,595
it problematic for all of that. So the first week
or two after that I was like (sad sigh) why? Maybe

2746
03:11:19,595 --> 03:11:24,238
you should have just killed me. (frustrated sigh)
It took like ten episodes to go through Empire

2747
03:11:24,238 --> 03:11:30,782
Strikes Back to maybe poke my head up slightly at
the very end of that, but it was a huge fucking

2748
03:11:30,782 --> 03:11:31,751
downturn.

2749
03:11:31,751 --> 03:11:33,531
LAURA: Poke your head up out of a pool of blood.

2750
03:11:33,531 --> 03:11:36,235
TALIESIN: I'm so excited for it. It's my favorite
thing going on right now.

2751
03:11:36,235 --> 03:11:38,288
TRAVIS: I wish I had smashed that skull.

2752
03:11:38,288 --> 03:11:39,772
TALIESIN: I know.

2753
03:11:39,772 --> 03:11:43,216
TRAVIS: Last bonus question. Pirates or ninjas?

2754
03:11:43,216 --> 03:11:44,955
SAM: Ninjas.

2755
03:11:44,955 --> 03:11:46,507
TALIESIN: Pirates!

2756
03:11:46,507 --> 03:11:47,603
LAURA: Pirates.

2757
03:11:47,603 --> 03:11:49,054
LIAM: Ninjas.

2758
03:11:49,054 --> 03:11:54,904
TRAVIS: Ninjas take it three to two. All right,
we're done! Liam, you are our temporary DM for the night.

2759
03:11:54,904 --> 03:11:59,273
SAM: Can you close out the night with your
patented phrase?

2760
03:11:59,273 --> 03:12:02,689
LIAM: Is it the day before Friday yet?

2761
03:12:02,689 --> 03:12:06,064
TRAVIS: Bye, guys! See you next week!
