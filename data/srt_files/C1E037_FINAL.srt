1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,616
MATT: Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, the show where a bunch of us

2
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:10,785
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons.
We're happy to be back. We all had an awesome

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:17,146
break; some good times away from the chaos of the
city for some of us. And we're happy to get this

4
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:21,984
ball rolling again. So we've missed you guys. In
case you can't tell right now, we have some cool

5
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:26,900
upgrades to the set, actually, if you want to have
a look around real fast. The hardworking folks

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,092
here at Geek and Sundry were awesome enough to go
ahead and build this awesome set, and we're happy

7
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:39,947
enough to have a guest here this evening, as
Ashley Johnson is able to hang with us tonight.

8
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,286
ASHLEY: Hello! I like you!

9
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:44,958
MARISHA: Ashley! When did you get here!

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:57,795
ASHLEY: Oh man, you know, I just flew in. Oh no,
we're running out of space. Grog! Hi, guys. Wow,

11
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:59,539
this looks amazing!

12
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:05,564
MATT: Yeah, the set upgrades are awesome. This is
a tribute to the awesome crew that put all this

13
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:09,930
together over the break, so you guys did an
awesome job. Give a big shout-out to the Geek and

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,527
Sundry crew. Yeah, and so for those who saw
earlier tweets, we're pushing off Critmas to

15
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:21,803
probably next week because we're all returning
from break, we're all getting back into the swing

16
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:28,236
of things, and we're still getting our bearings
here. So we're doing that next week. But

17
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:32,467
nevertheless, let's go ahead and start off with
some of our quick announcements as we wait for the

18
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:43,335
illustrious Sam Riegel to find his way here. There
was a clamoring from the fanbase to extend the

19
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:48,393
sale of the Critmas sweaters. Orders kept coming
in, so we've extended it up to this point.

20
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,678
However, I believe tonight, is it, tonight?

21
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,048
LAURA: Tonight is the last night.

22
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,132
MATT: The very last night to purchase your Critmas
sweaters--

23
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,916
LAURA: And then it's gone forever.

24
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,171
MATT: Forever.

25
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,207
MARISHA: I lived in mine over the holiday.

26
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,189
LAURA: Yes, you did. Every time I saw you were
wearing it.

27
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,479
LIAM: They're very soft on the inside.

28
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,792
MARISHA: Very soft.

29
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,036
TALIESIN: I have not seen a picture of my brother
without his.

30
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,811
MARISHA: They're so comfy.

31
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,000
MATT: I'm so glad that we've converted your
brother into a dungeon master.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,421
TALIESIN: It's so adorable! Oh, he's
watching right now and I just called him adorable.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,964
I feel so bad.

34
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:22,236
MARISHA: And we found out your parents watch! We
had no idea your parents watched.

35
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:25,272
MATT: Yeah, my parents were like, yeah, no, we'll
be there, we'll watch it. I was like, really? In

36
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:29,244
Hawaii? In the middle of the jungle? Like, yeah, I
guess we're Critters. I'm like, my parents are

37
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:30,278
Critters.

38
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:31,947
LAURA: Your parents are Critters?

39
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:38,506
MATT: Sam plowed that pathway first, so Momlan,
definitely the most active of the Critter parents.

40
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:47,792
So. Hi, guys, if you're watching. We still have
the awesome Wyrmwood Gaming thing they're

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,685
providing for all you guys. They have their custom
dice boxes and containment elements.

42
00:02:52,685 --> 00:03:00,332
LIAM: And the code for free shipping is CritRole.
CritRole, and the shipping is free.

43
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,510
MATT: Isn't that cool?

44
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,955
MARISHA: I think this is also technically yours,
too.

45
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,832
LAURA: Yeah, that box is hers.

46
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:19,110
MARISHA: Yeah, we put expansion pack spell cards
in there that we can all use.

47
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,123
MATT: Mostly poop, though. We kept cards in it, it
gets, yeah, you've got to search for it.

48
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:35,067
Collectible poop. From our foraging. From Scanlan.
So yeah, Wyrmwood Gaming, CritRole for free

49
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:40,364
shipping. That's awesome. Thank you, guys, again
for providing that for our awesome fanbase. Also,

50
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:49,234
I've just finally put up my final-- outside of,
barring some horrible exploit that shows up months

51
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:55,854
from now-- my final update to the Blood Hunter
class as of ten minutes ago. You can go to my

52
00:03:55,854 --> 00:04:00,096
twitter. I think the link on the Geek and Sundry
page isn't working, it still goes to the old PDF,

53
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:04,186
but I had the link to the new PDF on my twitter,
will be put up there shortly. A bunch of updates

54
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:07,888
and with a link to the page that has all the patch
notes, if you will.

55
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:09,140
MARISHA: And new art.

56
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,928
MATT: And new art from our fantastic artist Joma
who has done our poster and stuff; he did an

57
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:20,307
incredible job. He named the character Elias and I
think Elias the Blood Hunter is my new spirit

58
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:24,700
animal. So thank you, Joma, for that, you're
amazing, and go check it out and see. If you're

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,734
playing a Blood Hunter, it's got some cool updates
and I think some things you'll like. Also, our

60
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:36,837
artist Kit Buss put up today her first peek of our
new character art designs.

61
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:38,122
LIAM: She put it all up.

62
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,547
MATT: Oh, it's all up? She put it all up.

63
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,747
LIAM: She did a group shot and then she did this
long row of each separate.

64
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:46,561
MARISHA: Oh, I haven't seen that one yet.

65
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,458
LAURA: Yeah. It's pretty remarkable.

66
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,498
TALIESIN: Season two. Season two art.

67
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:57,314
MATT: I don't know when this became season two,
but apparently, it's season two now. So. Season

68
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:03,576
two. (laughs) That's cool. So go check out Kit's
art and you get to see the evolution of the Vox

69
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,776
Machina outfits and designs.

70
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:10,621
TALIESIN: I have poofy arms now. I like my poofy
arms. I've got little poofy arms. They're great.

71
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:14,046
MARISHA: I've got body paint. Ashy body paint.

72
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:17,317
MATT: Yeah. And don't think this invalidates the
previous designs, either. This is just one of

73
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,496
their various facets.

74
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:19,885
LIAM: We have more than one set of clothes.

75
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,854
LAURA: Yeah, otherwise, we'd all smell like Grog.

76
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,182
ASHLEY: Ooh, burn.

77
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,406
LAURA: Diss!

78
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:27,226
TRAVIS: Or a compliment.

79
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,178
(laughter)

80
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:34,092
MATT: I wanted to put a thank-you out there to the
amazing community of Critters that came together

81
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:41,052
to do that Christmas art bomb. For those who
haven't seen it yet, Liam here collaborated with a

82
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:47,173
lot of you guys to put together an amazing gallery
of Christmas, holiday-themed Critical Role art, and

83
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,496
it's brilliant. If you haven't seen the gallery
yet, I highly recommend it. You can find it on the

84
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,727
website. You are a rogue, sir.

85
00:05:53,727 --> 00:06:00,242
LIAM: Well, I love everyone in the room and I love
all of you watching, so thank you.

86
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:04,190
(laughter)

87
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,444
LIAM: It came out great. I was extremely happy, so
were they, so were you, so win-win.

88
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:12,636
TALIESIN: So much art.

89
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:17,548
MATT: The last bit of my announcements for the
evening, I wanted to put another thank-you out to

90
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:22,668
the amazing Critter community. Thanks to you guys,
even after Extra Life and everything that went on

91
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:26,659
towards the end of the year, we were still able to
donate an additional $5,000 to 826LA over the

92
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,871
Christmas break.

93
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:30,340
(cheering)

94
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,460
MATT: They're looking forward to continue working
with us. We're looking forward to continue working

95
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,151
with them, as well as the many other charities
that we put up as part of our Guide to Critmas

96
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:41,063
page. But they're very thankful and we're
extremely thankful to have you guys being so

97
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:45,767
active in giving back to the communities and
helping these wonderful opportunities for younger

98
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:49,646
kids to express their imaginations and creative
writing skills. So thank you guys for being so

99
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,260
awesome.

100
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,846
TRAVIS: Reading and writing is good. It's very
imp-- imp-- is good.

101
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,280
TALIESIN: It's very impotent?

102
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,013
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been told I'm very impotent.

103
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,604
(laughter)

104
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:05,977
TALIESIN: Thank you for running with that.

105
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:08,129
MATT: We got to get Grog on a side quest for
826LA.

106
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,900
TRAVIS: You're very impotent to me.

107
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,894
TALIESIN: Don't make it too hard.

108
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:23,098
MATT: (rimshot) All righty, so. While we wait for
Sam to arrive, let's go ahead and get into the

109
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,245
game--

110
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:31,494
LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's so pretty! The panels
behind us. I was just admiring--

111
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:36,612
MATT: I still haven't seen how the layout looks.
I'm really excited for it. Also, for the guys who

112
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,864
didn't notice, we've updated some of the models
and we have colors and a new camera setup.

113
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:44,957
Hopefully we're going to be testing it out in the
weeks to come for camera angles and stuff. Things

114
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:49,611
might shift as it happens, but the color scheme on
each of the characters' bases corresponds to their

115
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,693
portrait color, so it should be easier to
distinguish who is who on the battle mat going

116
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:59,644
forward, so hopefully that'll be helpful. All
right! Let's get into the thick of it.

117
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:12,313
So last we left off, Vox Machina had finished an
extensive, dangerous, tension-filled adventure to

118
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:19,389
the city of Whitestone, the historical landscape
that Percival had grown up in, to take down the

119
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:25,737
Briarwoods, two husband-and-wife team who had been
responsible for ruling it with an iron fist for

120
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:32,536
five years, doing a series of atrocities and
seemingly preparing a ziggurat, or an ancient

121
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:37,804
temple, beneath the city for some unspoken deity
that the party then discovered to be an individual

122
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:45,936
referred to as Vecna. They defeated the
Briarwoods, managed to help the rebellion of the

123
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:51,041
people of Whitestone retake their town, and helped
them set up, prepare, and have their first

124
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:55,652
Winter's Crest festival in five years, since they
were taken by the Briarwoods. There was much

125
00:08:55,652 --> 00:09:06,085
game-playing and eating contests and polymorphed
bears and very fun adventures and exchange of gifts

126
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:13,151
and some fun moments and the party, as we return
now, the festival over, a few days past, begin

127
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:20,421
to put their affairs in order to return back to
Emon in what their next order of business is.

128
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:26,990
So picking up from there, it's been a few days
since the Winter's Crest festival has finished,

129
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,362
and most of the decorations, as quickly put
together as they were given the circumstances,

130
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,210
still loosely hang around the city as a reminder
of the first real beacon of positivity in this

131
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:43,241
city's history in a while. The town's much more
lively, as people are less afraid to walk out into

132
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:47,355
the streets during the day and it's like watching
it really come to life over these past few weeks.

133
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,113
TRAVIS: Sam's here.

134
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:56,983
MATT: He's going to go ahead and get a Scanlan.
Grog wouldn't be paying attention anyway. It's

135
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,094
fine.

136
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:59,622
ASHLEY: Squirrel!

137
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:03,536
TALIESIN: (Grog voice) It's true. It's very true.

138
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:15,944
MATT: You've sent off word to Allura in Emon
regarding the strange black dot that stands at the

139
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,086
top of the ziggurat and letting her know the
circumstance, and heard back from her that it

140
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:22,303
seems that--

141
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,934
(laughter)

142
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:28,137
TALIESIN: Smooth. Well done.

143
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,634
MATT: And welcome back, Sam Riegel.

144
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,142
SAM: Where am I?

145
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:35,643
ASHLEY: I know. It's so magical.

146
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:45,104
SAM: What's going on? Oh my god, Ashley's here! Oh
my god, you're here! Okay, sorry. You were

147
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,243
recapping.

148
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:54,790
MATT: That's okay. So where was I? Yes, okay. So
with the town being set where it is, you sent word

149
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,015
to Allura Vysoren, and she's going to gather a few
friends and investigate the ziggurat to see what

150
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:08,370
the nature of this lingering magic is. However,
there still stands the part of returning to the

151
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,881
Council and proving your innocence, amongst other
loose threads you wish to pursue. What would you

152
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,073
like to do?

153
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:19,974
MARISHA: Well, we have all that awesome proof,
right?

154
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,705
LAURA: I think we need to head back to Emon.

155
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,832
SAM: Do we have proof? What do we have?

156
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:31,412
LAURA: We have all of the documents that you took
from the Briarwoods' stuff. Plus, we have--

157
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:35,568
SAM: Physical? Do we have someone who could back
up our testimony?

158
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:38,504
LAURA: The new rulers, yeah.

159
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,141
SAM: Well, they're not going to come with us, are
they?

160
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,946
LAURA: Well, we've got Percival. He's kind of in
charge.

161
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,927
TALIESIN: I'm kind of a big deal.

162
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,743
MARISHA: I feel like they'll see that as a
conflict of interest.

163
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,319
TALIESIN: That's fair.

164
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,312
SAM: Should we bring someone along to corroborate
our stories?

165
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:59,778
LIAM: What about-- I know someone needs to mind the
store here in town, but Cassandra was in their

166
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:04,025
pockets for a long time, and what about Father--

167
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,579
MARISHA: Yennen? Yevon? Yennen?

168
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,799
TALIESIN: We could have them write a letter, and
we can seal it and then it would be official.

169
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,299
LAURA: Let's do that.

170
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:15,423
MARISHA: Make sure that they notarize it and all
that good stuff.

171
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:18,720
TALIESIN: Governments function on paperwork.
People have to take this seriously.

172
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,440
LAURA: That's right. They can't very well arrest
Percival when he's royalty now.

173
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,582
LIAM: Technically royalty before.

174
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,945
LAURA: Well, now he's rich royalty.

175
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,853
TALIESIN: We have money now.

176
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,762
SAM: Do we? How much money do we have?

177
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:36,389
TALIESIN: It depends on what we want.

178
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,146
MARISHA: Depends on what we want?

179
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:41,208
TALIESIN: We can't bankrupt the treasury or
anything, but I'm sure that we can dip.

180
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,059
LAURA: 50,000 gold?

181
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,147
TALIESIN: Don't put a number on family.

182
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:48,652
LAURA: Flying carpet gold?

183
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:51,017
TALIESIN: That's actually a very good question.

184
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:55,821
TRAVIS: So we go get a letter and we go back to
Emon and clear our name.

185
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,610
SAM: That's our evidence?

186
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,610
LAURA: Plus all of the documents that you found!

187
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,540
SAM: All right, paper trail.

188
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,428
TALIESIN: Actually, that's a really interesting
idea. Is there anybody in town who could reenchant

189
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:12,042
our carpet?

190
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:17,487
MARISHA: Well, he said it would take a year, and
you'd need to have Allura work on that.

191
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,397
TALIESIN: I'm asking the Yellow Pages.

192
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:25,048
MATT: As far as you know from your experience in
the town, there were two main sources of

193
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:31,723
individuals that had focused on enchanting items.
One of which, their abode or their shop had been

194
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:36,857
collapsed and they were no longer seen, and the
other one had apparently been acquired by the

195
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:41,812
Briarwoods to aid them in the construction of the
ziggurat and you met his daughter, and he never

196
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:42,912
turned up.

197
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:47,156
LAURA: Okay. Maybe we can wait until we get back
to Emon and have Gilmore do it.

198
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:49,262
TALIESIN: We'll talk to them and see what's
possible.

199
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:54,903
LAURA: Oh, we can't really ask Allura to do it. We
stole the carpet from her in the first place. That

200
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:57,349
would be a very bad move, I think.

201
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:01,630
TRAVIS: Oh, we could just say somebody stole it
from her. We stole it from them, we were trying to

202
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,314
return it, it fell in acid.

203
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:06,780
LAURA: But then what? We wouldn't get it back.

204
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:14,980
TRAVIS: Well, she fixes it. Oh, here's a gift for
recovering the rug. It makes perfect sense to me.

205
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,544
MARISHA: To be fair, she was just using it as a
rug.

206
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:19,391
TRAVIS: Right.

207
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,499
MARISHA: Right?

208
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:24,350
SAM: Yeah, that seems like a really expensive
rug.

209
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,609
LAURA: Maybe she was keeping it secret. Keeping it
safe.

210
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:31,848
SAM: All right, forget it. Let's just go.

211
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:36,592
TALIESIN: I'm going to craft that thing that I've
been wanting to craft, so that was, that we talked

212
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:37,319
about.

213
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:40,462
MATT: Okay, so over the past few days. Okay. As
you guys are all preparing the circumstance over

214
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,153
these next few days, you've gone into your
original workshop, which is a little more

215
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:47,596
ramshackle than the one you have back in Emon that
was built for you. This was just the one that you

216
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,778
had pieced together while you were growing up in
Whitestone. I would like for you to go ahead and

217
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:54,045
make a tinkering check, if you don't mind.

218
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:59,075
LAURA: Plus, we had them send word to Uriel,
remember? We had them send a letter to Uriel,

219
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:02,962
explaining all the wonderful things we did. Yes, I
talked to him.

220
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,800
TALIESIN: Shut up!

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,104
TRAVIS: How did the golden snitch do?

222
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:12,179
LIAM: Not well. Not with that face.

223
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,351
TALIESIN: Can I use my resolve?

224
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:20,013
MATT: That's a saving throw, unfortunately. That's
not a skill check.

225
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,191
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. 11.

226
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:26,351
MATT: 11? This is to craft the--

227
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:30,253
TALIESIN: Well, I'm doing the whole kit and
caboodle.

228
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,571
MATT: The entire thing?

229
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:38,989
TALIESIN: Well, if I can break it up into chunks,
then that will be-- taking it apart. I'm going to

230
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,422
take it apart, I'm going to put it back together,
and I'm going to add the fifth barrel.

231
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:53,859
MATT: Okay. (sighs) You manage to pull apart, over
the period of a few days, Ripley's pistol. You

232
00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:01,447
take aspects of whitestone and residuum dust as
well as residuum glass and begin to reconstruct

233
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:10,752
it, based on its elements, in a much more refined,
in a much more Percival-practiced method. You

234
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:19,738
attach the fifth barrel, the one that you intend
to be used to deliver short-range explosives, and

235
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:21,953
it <i>seems</i> to fit together.

236
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,472
TALIESIN: Okay.

237
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:30,521
MATT: It's nothing fancy, and a little part of you
goes like, it's rattling a little when you shake

238
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,064
it in your hand.

239
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:34,649
TALIESIN: Can I give it a once-over?

240
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:39,421
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check. No,
this would be investigation.

241
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:45,025
TALIESIN: I hate you. The difference between those
rolls are really impressive.

242
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:49,702
MATT: This is where the intellect plays off,
guys.

243
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:55,261
TALIESIN: Whoa! Okay, I'm going to point out that
I just rolled my die before the game started and

244
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:58,039
rolled a natural 20 on my first roll. Five.

245
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,946
TRAVIS: 2016, bitch.

246
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:07,075
MATT: Okay. It looks pretty solid. You think it
would be wise to take additional materials with

247
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:11,985
you as you leave, just in case you want to build
something else, but this seems functional.

248
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:16,776
TALIESIN: I've got all the little bits. I'm going
to definitely-- I've learned my lesson.

249
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:23,373
MATT: So in theory, going forward, the gun does
function, but every misfire number is increased by

250
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:24,462
two.

251
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:27,261
TALIESIN: So that gives me a three and a--

252
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:32,426
MATT: A misfire of three on the pistol and what is
now a misfire of five with the fifth barrel.

253
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:36,174
TALIESIN: That'll be funny. Oh, I also have to
make some ammo for it, since it's individual ammo,

254
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:38,376
so should I just roll for that?

255
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:41,853
MATT: Well, for the ammunition it has to be a
little more specific. We'll get to that. With the

256
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,537
time you have at this point, you've just
managed to finish that before you guys are ready

257
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:50,027
to go. Cool, all right. So what's the intent,
guys?

258
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,041
LAURA: So we're heading back to Emon. But we did
send a letter ahead!

259
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:58,987
MATT: You sent a letter, notifying them of what
has happened, that Whitestone has been freed.

260
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:04,002
LAURA: And remember I said make sure to tell them
how Vox Machina saved the day, and how wonderful

261
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:08,799
we are, and you said, yes you would do that.

262
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,300
MATT: As far as you know, that's been sent.

263
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,610
LIAM: So all the messages-- because I sent word
out to Gilmore, as well-- we haven't heard

264
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,405
anything back from anyone, though. It's too soon,
yeah?

265
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,805
MATT: It's been pretty soon. That was just a few
days ago in Whitestone.

266
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:22,353
LAURA: I also think I probably sent a letter to
Pike to let her know that we're safe and we

267
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:27,994
survived everything, and that she would've been at
Winter's Crest.

268
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,853
MATT: It was hard thinking of an address in
Vasselheim that would reach her, but you did your

269
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:34,780
best to conjecture, and you attempted it, so we'll
see if it finds its way.

270
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,856
ASHLEY: Maybe it worked!

271
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,013
(laughter)

272
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,791
MATT: All right, so how are you guys getting back
to Emon?

273
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,214
SAM: On our horses that we own. Do we own horses?

274
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:46,947
MARISHA: They were eaten by harpies.

275
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,264
SAM: Let's go buy some horses.

276
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,957
TALIESIN: On the harpies that we own.

277
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:54,077
LAURA: They've got to, right? They have horses
here.

278
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,771
MATT: There are a couple liveries here that do
sell, aside from keeping the horses of the actual

279
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:58,779
guard.

280
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:05,228
LIAM: Percival, you have the run of this place,
somewhat.

281
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,584
TALIESIN: I'm going to assume that I can use some
family connections to finagle a few horses.

282
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:13,415
MATT: Okay. I'd say you're looking at probably
about five to six days' travel on horseback to get

283
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,872
back to Emon.

284
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,200
SAM: Is there a faster way?

285
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,771
MARISHA: There's no teleportation circles, is
there?

286
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,099
LAURA: No. They don't have one.

287
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,951
LIAM: Can't you walk us through an oak tree?

288
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,700
MARISHA: I can. Yeah. Actually.

289
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,087
LAURA: Yeah, walk us through an oak tree!

290
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,323
SAM: All of us?

291
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:28,513
MARISHA: Long as we all jump within six seconds.

292
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:30,130
SAM: What happens if we don't?

293
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,586
LAURA: We're left behind.

294
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:37,875
MATT: Yeah, it's not a challenge, really. It's
just a very short time period. Yeah, you can do

295
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,059
that if you want to.

296
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,360
TALIESIN: We have an instant teleportation as a
worst-case scenario.

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,947
SAM: And where does it take us?

298
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,814
MARISHA: Home. To our keep.

299
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:47,609
SAM: Sounds crazy. Can we always use this?

300
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:52,872
TALIESIN: We'll actually in theory beat the
letters that we sent. That's okay; we have proof.

301
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,018
MARISHA: But it's coming. It's on the way.

302
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:59,182
SAM: So wait, you can zap us anywhere in the
world?

303
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:04,108
MARISHA: I have a 6th-level spell called
Teleportation via Plants, where as long as I've

304
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:08,261
seen the tree before, we can walk through the tree.

305
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:10,348
LAURA and TALIESIN: We're getting another letter.

306
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:12,817
LAURA: Sealed, so it looks like we didn't tamper
with it.

307
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:17,513
MATT: Easy enough to get it signed by Keeper
Yennen, you get it signed by Cassandra.

308
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:25,263
LIAM: And everything is good here for when we go,
Percival? Your sister and everyone, Keeper

309
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:26,681
what's-his-butt?

310
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:30,922
TALIESIN: If anything goes wrong, we'll hear about
it, and we can come back.

311
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,477
SAM: What's going on with the spinning black cube?
Are we okay?

312
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:38,404
LAURA: Isn't Allura on her way here? Aren't a lot
of people on their way here? I'm so confused.

313
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,471
MARISHA: That's true, wasn't Allura on her way?

314
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:45,466
SAM: What happened in 2015? The whole way through.
Start from the beginning.

315
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:48,122
LIAM: Well, first there were dinosaurs.

316
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:57,711
MATT: Yes. Last you were told, Allura is coming
with a couple of companions to investigate the

317
00:20:57,711 --> 00:21:03,108
ziggurat. There was no indication that you're
required for that, nor could you really aid in that--

318
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,709
TRAVIS: Speak for yourself.

319
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:11,626
MATT: Well, your vast understanding of arcane
elements and the history of magic should come in

320
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:12,725
handy.

321
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:15,592
LAURA: And Drez Vina, right? He's coming, too?
He's had a notice to him?

322
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:17,087
MATT: Drez Vina?

323
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,180
LAURA: Not Drez Vina.

324
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,854
LIAM: That's in the Wayback Machine.

325
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:23,209
MATT: You haven't seen Drez Vina in about a year
and a half.

326
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:26,940
MARISHA: The emperor dude?

327
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,514
LAURA: No.

328
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,129
LIAM: Victor, the powder guy.

329
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,746
TRAVIS: Are you looking for the notes that you
don't take?

330
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,137
LAURA: I take notes!

331
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:38,688
LIAM: Ivan from the other show? Do you mean Ivan,
from the show before us?

332
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,927
LAURA: I'm going to find his name, don't you
guys worry, then I'm going to bring it right up.

333
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,533
LIAM: She's the brains of the group.

334
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,909
TRAVIS: Can we go get that other fucking letter
please?

335
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,256
MARISHA and TALIESIN: We got it.

336
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:49,240
MATT: You acquired it. It didn't take much time.

337
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,642
MARISHA: Theoretically, they were trying to keep
Allura from us, anyway, so it's not like she can

338
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:59,946
help us in Emon. Right? So we can go home.

339
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:02,249
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's go
home.

340
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,516
LAURA: Let's hop in a tree.

341
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:05,454
MARISHA: Let's hop in a tree. What?

342
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:08,446
LIAM: I'm just going to say, here's what we don't
know: if we beat the letters home, if we try to

343
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:13,290
walk up with the letter, we should send someone to
them with the letter because probably Uriel came

344
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,594
to his senses once Sylas was hit with some dicks?

345
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:23,441
TRAVIS: What, we can't go find that boy you abused
in Emon and have him send the letter?

346
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,368
LIAM: Who?

347
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:26,045
TRAVIS: That little kid you smacked around who
wanted to join--

348
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,109
LIAM: He's long gone, man. I don't know where he
is.

349
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,417
TRAVIS: He's probably back, drawing pictures of
you on the city walls and crying.

350
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:39,173
LIAM: Get in line. But I don't think we want to
walk up ourselves, just in case. We should send

351
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,233
somebody.

352
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,797
LAURA: We'll head home. We'll send our butler.

353
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:47,335
TALIESIN: He's senile and gentle; they'll be
kind.

354
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:50,210
LAURA: Yes. They'll be very wonderful to him. I
can't find it.

355
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,323
LIAM: All right. Well, let's jump through.

356
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:56,757
MARISHA: Well, we technically already have a
letter coming, and we'll have a letter in hand.

357
00:22:56,757 --> 00:22:57,944
Right?

358
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,333
LIAM: Maybe we need more letters.

359
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,497
SAM: It'll be fine.

360
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:05,000
MATT: You also, be reminded, you that you have a
prisoner in the bottom of Greyskull Keep that was

361
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,410
a survivor of the Briarwood--

362
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,747
TRAVIS: If he's still alive.

363
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:08,996
MATT: Yeah, you haven't checked in.

364
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,458
LIAM: We don't know.

365
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,170
TRAVIS: We'll find out as soon as we get there.

366
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,825
TALIESIN: At least he'll be going home to a very
nice surprise.

367
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,125
TRAVIS: I got one gold piece he's turned to
kibble.

368
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,582
LAURA: Oh no.

369
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,730
MARISHA: Yeah, I hope our keep's still there.

370
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,968
SAM: Before we go, can I shit-scry?

371
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:28,613
MARISHA: To see our keep to make sure it's not on
fire? That's not a bad idea. Let's do it.

372
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:32,088
MATT: For people tuning in for the first time,
I'm going to give you no context.

373
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:38,339
SAM: I'm going to concentrate really hard on my
bowels. See if I can see anything.

374
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,653
LIAM: Roleplay this, Sam.

375
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:45,949
SAM: Fiber. No movement yet.

376
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:52,712
MATT: As you concentrate and close your eyes, you
take a moment to connect with that one moment in

377
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:56,738
Greyskull Keep, above the kitchen where you had
left your last present.

378
00:23:56,738 --> 00:24:00,661
SAM: It's a gift to the world, really.

379
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:05,999
MATT: This being relatively early morning on this
part of the countryside, you do look in and you

380
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:15,422
see that there is part of a breakfast being cooked
for whoever's running the guard time-portion that

381
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:20,234
part of the morning. Currently, nothing else
catching your attention.

382
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:23,022
TRAVIS: Breakfast being cooked, seriously.

383
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:26,847
MARISHA: You guys want some pancakes and bacon?

384
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,772
TRAVIS: Deep-fried French toast, baby.

385
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:32,126
MATT: You do see Laina in there walk in and start
cooking up some stuff and walk back out.

386
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:33,987
SAM: Oh, and she doesn't look like she's bleeding
from the eyes?

387
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,994
MATT: No, she looks to be quite healthy and quite
jovial, whistling a little tune, although you

388
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:38,675
can't hear it so well.

389
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:41,084
LAURA: Eskil Ryndarien was the one I was thinking
of.

390
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:45,592
MATT: There you go, Eskil Ryndarien. That's the
one, yeah. The archmage in Westruun.

391
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:48,927
LIAM: Those notes are written on her Pathfinder
sheet, tucked in.

392
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:54,087
MATT: That'll come in real handy. All right,
great.

393
00:24:54,087 --> 00:25:00,442
SAM: How do we do this, Keyleth? And more
importantly, how do we do it so that the bear

394
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:02,764
doesn't come with us?

395
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:11,228
MARISHA: The bear will probably be able to come
with us. Sorry.

396
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:13,242
LIAM: Pick a fat tree.

397
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:16,753
TALIESIN: Well, we have a really big fat tree
right in the town.

398
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:20,384
LIAM: After all that pie, Trinket's a little wide
in the haunches.

399
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,787
LAURA: He looks good.

400
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,990
MARISHA: He can fit through the Sun Tree, right?

401
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,659
MATT: The Sun Tree's definitely a large enough
tree to create the portal you can step through,

402
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:30,735
yeah.

403
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,277
MARISHA: Let's use the Sun Tree.

404
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:34,919
MATT: All right. So the rest of you guys gather
towards the center of the town square in the

405
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,627
middle of Whitestone. You approach the Sun Tree,
and Keyleth, you step forward.

406
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:41,656
MARISHA: I say, hey boo. I'll see you soon.

407
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:46,856
MATT: You hear the tree silently fist bump you
through its arcane connection.

408
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:49,750
MARISHA: You be good, you take care of you, man.

409
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,121
MATT: You hear a voice whisper in the back of your
mind, "You too, girl."

410
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:59,393
MARISHA: This is the best tree of all time.

411
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,293
LIAM: Tolkien would be proud, Matt.

412
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:10,502
MATT: As you trace your fingers across the surface
of the Sun Tree, its large, curled boughs now

413
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:16,256
starting to sprout remnants of what looks to be
fresh leaves. Where your fingers trace, the bark

414
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:22,782
itself seems to glow with a bright vibrant
yellowish-orange color. As you create a full oval

415
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:27,995
shape that would fit most of your party, suddenly,
there's a sucking sound, and it's like the bark is

416
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:33,436
pulled into a distant doorway. And from what you
can see, it's almost like someone carved a tunnel

417
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:36,531
through the Sun Tree that traverses for about 30
or so feet.

418
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,335
MARISHA: Are these cartoon physics?

419
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:39,651
MATT: Essentially.

420
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,066
LAURA: Yeah! We should go soon, though. Right?

421
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,142
MARISHA: Jump!

422
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:46,423
MATT: All of you guys come walking through it, and
it is a short-term tunnel. Immediately, you can

423
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:51,778
see the other side of it, and as you step through,
you can already feel behind you the entrance

424
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:57,120
closing. As you push through with Trinket and Grog
pulling up the rear, you can feel the actual tunnel

425
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,303
closing behind you.

426
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:09,318
All of you come bursting out of the other side of
one of the trees that is currently planted inside

427
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:14,002
the temple to Sarenrae within Greyskull Keep, and
as you all gather yourselves and hear the closing

428
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:18,579
sound, the (sucking sound) of the doorway closing
behind you, you glance about and you can see all

429
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:26,318
the stained glass, the rosebushes that are well
kept, there are a series of small wooden benches

430
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:32,158
that are placed in a pattern, and behind you, you
see currently wiping down the stone on the front

431
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:38,566
of the temple is, in plain clothes, a sleepy-eyed,
currently woken-up Pike.

432
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:41,342
LAURA: Pike!

433
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:43,446
ASHLEY: Hi!

434
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,687
SAM: What are you doing here?

435
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:48,297
MARISHA: Why are you sleeping outside? You have a
bed upstairs!

436
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:50,249
ASHLEY: No, I do! I couldn't sleep!

437
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:54,013
LAURA: I thought you were in Vasselheim!

438
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:56,863
MARISHA: How long have you been here? So many
questions!

439
00:27:56,863 --> 00:28:07,579
MATT: When you had heard the party was going to
Whitestone, you were already in fear of what may

440
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:12,742
lie there, knowing the history of Percy's past and
hearing bits here and there. You came to try and

441
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:17,319
catch them before they left, but by the time you
came to Emon, they had already been gone for quite

442
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,898
some time.

443
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,109
LAURA: So you've been scrying to us the whole time
from here?

444
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:22,261
ASHLEY: Yes!

445
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,891
LAURA: Why didn't you say anything?

446
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:25,930
ASHLEY: I didn't think to say anything.

447
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:33,605
MARISHA: We literally kicked it for a weekend and
went to a festival. We could've come back.

448
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:36,674
ASHLEY: I know, but work needed to be done.

449
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:45,589
TRAVIS: So thoughtful, Pike! Oh, my best friend!
She's so thoughtful.

450
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:48,398
ASHLEY: So you guys made it out.

451
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:57,658
MARISHA: Yeah, thanks to you. (excited stammering)
Did you feel our bag of dicks that we did? Were

452
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:05,218
you aware of our bag of holy light dicks? That was
an out-of-context thing.

453
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:08,387
ASHLEY: I don't know what that is, but it sounds
pretty fascinating.

454
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:13,729
MARISHA: Me and you teamed up, and we killed Lady
Briarwood by--

455
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:16,271
ASHLEY: Oh yes, how could I forget!

456
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:19,302
MARISHA: Well, I didn't know how aware you were,
because your connection was fuzzy.

457
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:21,890
ASHLEY: Fully aware of the bag of dicks.

458
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,293
MARISHA: That was awesome!

459
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:25,556
ASHLEY: I totally spaced. Oh wow.

460
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:29,119
TALIESIN: Who taught you the phrase "bag of
dicks?"

461
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,471
MARISHA: I read it in a book.

462
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,454
LAURA and ASHLEY: Hi.

463
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:34,944
TRAVIS: Bag of Richards.

464
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:37,060
ASHLEY: Bag of Richards?

465
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,932
LAURA: Have you seen the prisoner here?

466
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:43,639
ASHLEY: There's a prisoner here?

467
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,868
MATT: You haven't, actually, in the time you've
been here.

468
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,451
ASHLEY: No, I haven't. I've been cleaning. I've had
such a need to clean.

469
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:54,339
TRAVIS: We actually need him for something. You
want to come see him? Yeah, we're protecting him.

470
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:55,984
Let's go. We run down.

471
00:29:55,984 --> 00:30:02,880
MATT: As you guys head out of the temple, it leads
you into the main foyer area. Stepping out into

472
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,207
the foyer, you immediately hear a loud metal clang
in the hallway around to your right.

473
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,552
ASHLEY: Is it my armor just falling over?

474
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:15,001
(laughter)

475
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,611
MATT: And you all immediately stop for a moment.

476
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,005
LAURA: Hello? What was that?

477
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:22,161
MATT: You hear some other rustling down at the edge
of the hallway.

478
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:24,653
SAM: Are we on the top floor, or down where the--

479
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:28,313
MATT: You guys are in the foyer of the main
temple's base floor.

480
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:31,791
SAM: Okay. Pike, stay here. I'll take care of
this.

481
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,110
ASHLEY: Are you sure?

482
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,594
SAM: I was born sure.

483
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:37,150
ASHLEY: Okay.

484
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,671
SAM: I go forth to investigate.

485
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,586
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

486
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:44,740
LIAM: As he walks down the stairs, I call out:
don't get caught, shithead.

487
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,175
SAM: Stealth?

488
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:50,385
MATT: Yes.

489
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:51,347
SAM: 18.

490
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:56,702
MATT: Okay. As you come around the corner into the
main central hallway of the foyer you can see

491
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:01,149
there is, to the right is the dining room area,
and that's closed, and you can smell the breakfast

492
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:05,366
being cooked in the kitchen that's far down to the
right of the hallway. To the left is the arcane

493
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:10,355
laboratory. The door is currently ajar, and you
hear the rustling from the inside.

494
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,558
MARISHA: Aw, someone's going through our shit.

495
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:21,187
SAM: I'm going in there to investigate. You know
what? I'll go invisible first, and then I'll creep in.

496
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:28,817
MATT: Okay. All right, so. Your image dissipates
and vanishes. As you tiptoe up and peek around the

497
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:34,805
corner of the doorway, you can see now there's a
few small metallic instruments that have fallen to

498
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:44,031
the ground, and you see a familiar humanoid red
dragon-scaled individual who is currently picking

499
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:49,904
up. (grumbling) "Confounded thing." And puts it
into a bag and starts tying it up and is currently

500
00:31:49,904 --> 00:31:53,203
packing up the laboratory.

501
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:58,121
SAM: I drop my invisibility and go over and give
Tibsy a big hug.

502
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:03,958
MATT: Out of nowhere you, (startled grumbling) And
pushes you away and grabs the staff and spins around.

503
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,815
SAM: It's me! It's me! Little, yellow, different!
Me!

504
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,726
MATT: "You mustn't sneak up on a Stormwind like
that."

505
00:32:10,726 --> 00:32:14,897
SAM: I'm sorry, I just, it's been so long and
we've been through so much without you. I was

506
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:21,195
overcome, I'm sorry. Friends, it's all right!
Pike, I cleared the danger!

507
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:24,555
ASHLEY: I go in. Hi Tibs!

508
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:32,281
MATT: As you guys walk in, you see Tiberius
seems both surprised and keeping a composure

509
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:40,551
element to him, his chin high. "Greetings and
salutations, friends. I'd hoped I'd see you before

510
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,872
"heading out."

511
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,165
LAURA: Heading out?

512
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:44,381
TALIESIN: Heading what?

513
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:52,276
MATT: "Well, I've spent a few weeks in Draconia
trying to secure aid for us in Whitestone."

514
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,582
SAM: Are you from Draconia?

515
00:32:54,582 --> 00:33:06,114
MATT: "Indeed I am. But over these past few weeks
I've been continuously balked by my father. By the

516
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:12,132
"time I had given up and came to join you, word
found me of your victory. Thus, I instead remained

517
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:21,681
"here in Emon. I've had some time to think, being
here on my own for the better part of a week now.

518
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:34,194
"I consider you all friends and fine warriors,
mostly. I've enjoyed our travels together, I've

519
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:44,473
"learned much, and for that I thank you sincerely.
However, my diplomatic mission has fallen to the

520
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:50,539
"wayside in these recent months, and while my
personal mission to recover these artifacts has

521
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:59,423
"grown stagnant, as proven by my time in Draconia,
I have still yet to gain the respect of my family.

522
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:07,338
"I feel that the path of Vox Machina and the path
of Tiberius Stormwind haven't been aligned for

523
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:14,979
"some time. In hearing about your victory with the
Stormwinds-- oh, that's me-- your victory with the

524
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:26,552
"Briarwoods, made me think that while I was sure
that you all needed me to protect you, I may have

525
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:35,972
"underestimated you all. Perhaps you are quite
capable without a Stormwind. And perhaps I am more

526
00:34:35,972 --> 00:34:44,648
"capable on my own pursuits, with no distractions.
I respect you all very deeply, and hope to

527
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:50,888
"continue to hear of your exploits across
Tal'Dorei, but I think it is time--" And he takes

528
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:56,379
his staff and smacks it on the ground and picks up
his bag of things. "I think it is time this

529
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:58,994
"dragonborn carved his own path."

530
00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:02,454
LIAM: You must leave immediately?

531
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:06,833
MATT: "I've been packing for a few days, as you
know."

532
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:21,211
LAURA: I go up and hug him, and say: what would
you like us to tell Uriel? I know they are wanting

533
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:22,834
you in court.

534
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:31,627
MATT: "The politics of these strange human
kingdoms don't really affect me. At least I figure

535
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,717
"you've got this taken care of, and you'll speak in
my name, of course, right, right?"

536
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:35,924
LAURA: Of course.

537
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:39,510
MATT: "Of course. So. Don't mess that up."

538
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,694
LAURA: Of course not, darling.

539
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:45,235
MATT: "At the time they'd even come to find me,
I'm sure the name would be cleared."

540
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:57,344
LIAM: I come out behind my sister and I take him
by the hand and I say: Tiberius, your friendship

541
00:35:57,344 --> 00:36:03,928
was always valued here. I don't think we'd be
standing here without you.

542
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,083
MATT: "That's true."

543
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,627
LIAM: I will never forget you.

544
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:17,237
MATT: "As I shall never forget all of you." And
you can see for a second there's a little tear

545
00:36:17,237 --> 00:36:27,992
cresting in his nose, and he like, "Dust. You know
that, of course." He looks around, takes a

546
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:29,750
moment.

547
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:39,756
SAM: Speaking as a man who has also had a romantic
interest in ladies before-- are there any romantic

548
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:46,139
messages you'd like me to pass on for you to
anyone in this town? Or others.

549
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,520
MATT: "You? No."

550
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,585
(laughter)

551
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:59,293
MATT: He turns to Keyleth, and takes Keyleth and
goes, "If you see her, tell Allura I'm sorry. But

552
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,379
"she's always welcome to visit me in Draconia."

553
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:06,165
MARISHA: I will. Bye, Tibsy. I give him a hug.

554
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:15,339
MATT: He pats you on the shoulder. "I'm very
terrible at goodbyes, so--" He steps back.

555
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:22,013
"Goodbye." Flicks his wrist and you can see an
already prepared teleportation circle in the room

556
00:37:22,013 --> 00:37:28,278
flash with blue runes as his image, waving towards
you, scatters into nothing.

557
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,585
SAM: Shit.

558
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:34,695
MATT: The runes die down to a cold magicless
circle.

559
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,989
LIAM: Safe travels, Stormwind.

560
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:42,354
SAM: Well, shit.

561
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:46,161
LIAM: Said the S.H.I.T.s.

562
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:49,141
(laughter)

563
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:53,865
TRAVIS: Did he leave us anything?

564
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,197
SAM: Grog.

565
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:56,141
TRAVIS: What?

566
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,689
SAM: Come on. Maybe we should check his room just
in case.

567
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:06,244
TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying! Oh, we have a
prisoner downstairs, though.

568
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:07,683
TALIESIN: Oh god, that's right.

569
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:09,178
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes.

570
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,841
TRAVIS: We run down to the prison cell.

571
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:13,213
LAURA: I stay and walk around his room a little
bit.

572
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:17,587
MATT: Okay. As the rest of you head down, you find
your way to the basement where your workshop is,

573
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:25,741
and there, sitting in a chair, currently eating a
small steel platter of breakfast, is Jarett, who

574
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:32,697
looks up immediately as you walk in and says,
(laughs) "Good morning to all of you! It has been

575
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:38,881
"quite some time since we've spoken. I am glad to
see that you're well and in one piece. Everything

576
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:45,590
"here has been fine." And he points back to, you
can see on the bed that was dragged down into the

577
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,565
prison cell. Oh, no, I think it was actually
dragged away.

578
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:49,672
TRAVIS: Dragged back out.

579
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:57,735
MATT: Dragged back out. See within the cell is the
small boy from Whitestone who's also now eating

580
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:02,940
off his own small platter as well, and his eyes
light up, mouth full of eggs. (muffled talking)

581
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,820
He seems to be fine and in good
health.

582
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,395
TRAVIS: Any other attacks on the castle while we
were gone?

583
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:09,802
LIAM: Yes, how did you fare?

584
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:14,153
MATT: "There were no other attacks as far as I
know, we kept a very very close eye, and for a

585
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:18,937
"while we had a fine elemental protector from, with
help here from Lady Keyleth."

586
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:22,733
MARISHA: Yes, how did that work? Just curious,
because he was kind of a test run.

587
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:25,754
MATT: "Yeah, very unsettling, to be perfectly
honest. "

588
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:28,077
MARISHA: Oh good, good. That's what I was going
for.

589
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:34,609
MATT: "Yeah, I don't feel comfortable with
haphazardly tethered creatures from other realms.

590
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:39,120
"It historically has gone very poorly, so it was
good to know that nothing bad terribly happens."

591
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,141
MARISHA: Sure! Awesome.

592
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:47,435
TALIESIN: Well, the good news is, we can let you
go. You're free and clear, the Briarwoods will not

593
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:51,656
be a problem anymore, and Whitestone is rather
pleasant at the moment.

594
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,498
TRAVIS: He's not free and clear.

595
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:55,364
SAM: He's got to come with us to testify.

596
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:57,929
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, I suppose there is the
matter of testimony.

597
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,687
LAURA: I come down the stairs at this point.

598
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,668
TALIESIN: But we can open the cell, at the very
least.

599
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:04,710
LAURA: Yeah, why is he still in that cell?

600
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,840
TALIESIN: For his own protection, but that's
hardly a matter anymore.

601
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,283
MARISHA: Right, remember, we were going to let him
stay him the guest room, but he was like, I'm

602
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,451
going to stay--

603
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:18,208
MATT: Jarrett steps aside and starts opening the
cell as the boy finishes swallowing his eggs and

604
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,386
sits up.

605
00:40:19,386 --> 00:40:23,190
LIAM: Boy, what was your name again?

606
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,288
MATT: Waiting to see if she has it in her notes.

607
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:29,386
MARISHA: Well, I mean, I'll find it.

608
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,198
SAM: I've got it, I've got it somewhere.

609
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:32,843
MARISHA: It's in my old notebook.

610
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,497
MATT: Always fun to test these things.

611
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:38,225
LIAM: I mean, I asked you a direct question. But
that's all right.

612
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:41,626
LAURA: (singing) His name was Lola--

613
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,796
MATT: (singing) If I recall, it begins with a
'D.'

614
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:45,559
TRAVIS: Dante.

615
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,650
Dmitri.

616
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,752
Damien.

617
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:49,031
Dingleberry.

618
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,032
Darren.

619
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,789
Dane.

620
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,297
Dylan?

621
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:56,099
LIAM: Matthew Mercer.

622
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,327
MATT: Technically.

623
00:40:57,327 --> 00:41:03,440
SAM: Earthbreaker Groon.

624
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,050
Arbiter Brom.

625
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,658
Ben Klauss.

626
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,286
LIAM: Anemone Tea.

627
00:41:08,286 --> 00:41:14,084
LAURA: Desmond. Desmond? Desmond!

628
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,040
MATT: I knew one of you wrote it down.

629
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,206
LAURA: Desmond, I had it right here, right there.
Desmond.

630
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:25,652
MATT: Desmond goes, "It's over? The Briarwoods are
no more?"

631
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,295
TALIESIN: Yes. All taken care of.

632
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:34,084
MATT: And you visually see a weight off his
shoulders. He seems to shrink almost three inches

633
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:38,596
from just the full exhale of his body, and a
little bit of tears well up in his eyes and he

634
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,507
says, "Whitestone? Does it still stand?"

635
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:45,501
LAURA: It's beautiful. And growing.

636
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:50,652
MATT: "I can't wait to get back."

637
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:51,642
LAURA: Desmond, dear?

638
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,489
MATT: "Yes?"

639
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,174
LAURA: Before you do, could we ask a small favor
of you?

640
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:58,906
MATT: "Of course. You kept me safe, you saved me.
Most of me."

641
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:07,772
LAURA: Would you mind speaking on our behalf to
Emperor Uriel? Emperor? Sovereign Uriel. That'd be

642
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:09,993
great. That'd just be wonderful.

643
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:12,765
MATT: "Of course, I'd be happy to, it'd be my
pleasure."

644
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:16,019
LAURA: Thank you. And you can, you know, come out
of the cell and eat with us, now.

645
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,026
MATT: "Great." And he goes and off the little
stone slab there he pulls his platter, which is

646
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:23,646
already half-eaten, and eagerly walks up holding
it with you, expectantly.

647
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:27,262
LAURA: Oh, right now! Sure, let's go then.

648
00:42:27,262 --> 00:42:30,077
TRAVIS: Oh, let me carry your plate for you. And I
start eating his food.

649
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:35,399
MATT: Okay. He doesn't notice, he's too excited.
You guys make your way back up to the dining room

650
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:42,345
area, and it's at that time that you see, coming
down the hall, Laina. Turns around the corner and

651
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:44,347
goes, "Pike?"

652
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:46,793
ASHLEY: Hi! There's more of us now!

653
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:51,684
MATT: "Oh, goodness me, look, everyone's returned!
That's wonderful, it's so good to see all of you."

654
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:53,885
LAURA: Good to see you too.

655
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,657
LIAM: You've kept the house in order. Good job,
thank you.

656
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:01,526
MATT: "I've done my best. I'm so excited to see
that you're all well. You don't look very well

657
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,941
"fed. I can fix that. Come on, this way."

658
00:43:03,941 --> 00:43:05,432
TRAVIS: Brilliant. Brilliant.

659
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:09,273
MATT: "I've just gotta make a little bit more,
but first course is coming! Please, please." And

660
00:43:09,273 --> 00:43:14,301
she opens the doors and leads you guys in the
dining area. You all sit down, Desmond joins you,

661
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:18,667
and she comes back and begins to prepare the rest
of the meal for you over the next half-hour or so.

662
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:27,261
While you dined on some really, really fine
Whitestone food while you were enjoying the fruits

663
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:31,328
of the Winter's Crest festival, it is nice to have
a home-cooked meal for a while.

664
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:33,130
LIAM: Traditional Emon breakfast.

665
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,432
LAURA: Eggs, baked beans--

666
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:37,883
LIAM: Yeah, fried tomato. Yeah, blood sausage.

667
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:40,648
SAM: Huevos rancheros.

668
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:45,275
(laughter)

669
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:47,571
LIAM: You dick.

670
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:55,444
MATT: All right. So you finished your meal, what
is your next order of business?

671
00:43:55,444 --> 00:43:57,884
MARISHA: What's today? What day is it?

672
00:43:57,884 --> 00:44:02,176
LAURA: Are there days of the week? What is a
weekend?

673
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:04,035
MARISHA: Yeah, there's days of the week.

674
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,526
SAM: What is this world? How does time work here?

675
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:12,683
MATT: There are days of the week, I'm not gonna go
into the specifics of it because I'm working on

676
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:17,827
it. This question hasn't really arisen before and
I probably should figure that out. It's the

677
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:24,466
equivalent of a Thursday.

678
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:27,374
SAM: It's always Thursday.

679
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:30,881
TALIESIN: So it's not hump day but we're not quite
waiting for the weekend yet?

680
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:32,457
TRAVIS: Hump day!

681
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:33,835
TALIESIN: Oh, Grog. By the way.

682
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:36,031
TRAVIS: Yeah? Shit.

683
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,571
TALIESIN: Did you think I'd forget?

684
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:38,675
TRAVIS: I throw him a gold coin.

685
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:39,559
TALIESIN: Thank you.

686
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:40,698
SAM: What's that for?

687
00:44:40,698 --> 00:44:43,179
TRAVIS: I thought Kibble would be dead, but he's
alive.

688
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,071
SAM: Who?

689
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,300
LAURA and LIAM: Desmond.

690
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,517
TRAVIS: Oh, Desmond.

691
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:51,040
ASHLEY: You call him Kibble?

692
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,437
MATT: "What?"

693
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:54,431
LAURA: Oh, we were just saying how well you look.

694
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,028
MATT: "Okay."

695
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,938
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep eating, Kibble.

696
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:01,078
MATT: He just continues finishing.

697
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:03,118
TALIESIN: If he dies, you don't get the gold coin
back.

698
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,225
TRAVIS: Fuck.

699
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:05,644
SAM: How is his hand doing?

700
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:06,606
MATT: Missing.

701
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:09,843
SAM: I mean, is it okay, there's no gangrene?

702
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:14,159
MATT: No, it was properly dressed and has been
changed as time went on while you guys were gone.

703
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,363
LAURA: Pike, no Pike didn't know he was here.

704
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:19,103
LIAM: Yeah, that's unfortunate.

705
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:21,006
MARISHA: She didn't go downstairs.

706
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:23,567
ASHLEY: I didn't, I just didn't need to go down
there.

707
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:29,143
LIAM: But there it is, right in front of you, all
red and swollen, gross.

708
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,341
LAURA: No, it's fine.

709
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:32,772
ASHLEY: How's his hand? How's your hand, Desmond?

710
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,519
LIAM: Can you do this? Can you do this, Desmond?

711
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,834
MATT: Crying into his eggs.

712
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,315
LAURA: Oh no.

713
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:42,284
MARISHA: That's mean, that's mean.

714
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:43,462
MATT: You're terrible.

715
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:45,278
TRAVIS: Him and little boys, man.

716
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:48,841
LAURA: I thought Desmond was like a teenager. Is
he, how young is he?

717
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:49,917
LIAM: Yeah, I did too.

718
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:53,136
MATT: Oh no, he's like close to 18, 19.

719
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:55,182
LIAM: Oh, there we go, a kid.

720
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,813
TRAVIS: Impressionable. Formative years.

721
00:45:56,813 --> 00:45:57,791
SAM: Of age.

722
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:58,606
TRAVIS: Of age.

723
00:45:58,606 --> 00:45:59,927
ASHLEY: Is his hand gone?

724
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:03,202
MATT: He's missing most of his fingers and a large
part of the upper part of the hand is missing.

725
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:07,115
Yeah, it's bandaged over, and he's still able to
kind of use part of the thumb.

726
00:46:07,115 --> 00:46:12,937
TALIESIN: I had a really bad day. I had a really
bad day.

727
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,414
ASHLEY: Can I try doing a little healing?

728
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:16,034
TALIESIN: I was possessed by an evil smoke demon.

729
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:20,177
ASHLEY: Might as well. Get the dice rolling.

730
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:24,202
SAM: Oh, Pike! Everyone stand back, my lady's
going to do something.

731
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:26,642
TALIESIN: She's going to try and undo some of my
poor decision-making.

732
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:30,264
LAURA: Can you grow back his digits?

733
00:46:30,264 --> 00:46:32,393
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

734
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:33,572
ASHLEY: What happened?

735
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:36,272
TRAVIS: Tell the truth.

736
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:38,398
TALIESIN: That's a good question.

737
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:41,165
LIAM: I think Whitestone owes this boy a little
coin.

738
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:45,779
TALIESIN: I would agree. Perhaps send him, I will
send him--

739
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:49,215
SAM: Well, after his testimony, should it prove to
be valuable.

740
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:52,414
MARISHA: How much coin did we pull out of the
treasury of Whitestone?

741
00:46:52,414 --> 00:46:55,568
LAURA: How about we don't talk about this in front
of other people?

742
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:57,839
TRAVIS: I could give him one of the expensive
bottles of wine.

743
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,758
TALIESIN: How about I send him with a letter
making sure that he is well-employed.

744
00:47:02,758 --> 00:47:04,796
LAURA: I think that is a beautiful, beautiful
gesture.

745
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,560
SAM: We should solve all of our problems with
letters from now on.

746
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,433
TALIESIN: If people would just learn, oh never
mind.

747
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:13,054
LIAM: Percival. Coin.

748
00:47:13,054 --> 00:47:13,917
LAURA: No.

749
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:14,971
LIAM: Yes.

750
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:17,703
SAM: How about after the testimony? He hasn't
fulfilled his duty.

751
00:47:17,703 --> 00:47:19,197
LIAM: Fine. Fine.

752
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:21,197
TALIESIN: I'm not sure what the price tag on a--

753
00:47:21,197 --> 00:47:23,093
ASHLEY: Can I try Lesser Restoration?

754
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,699
LIAM: Somewhat higher than zero.

755
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:25,850
TALIESIN: Yes.

756
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:35,581
MATT: Restoration is more of a, restoration is
more of a removal of impairments to, on like the

757
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:41,639
whole, like curses, charms, things that affect
their body and mind wholly. Current, you know,

758
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:48,618
like that. What you're looking for is more of a
very minor regeneration, which I would allow to a

759
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,024
very small extent with a high-powered heal.

760
00:47:51,024 --> 00:47:53,336
LIAM: You just blow in his thumb and all the
fingers go--

761
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:55,637
LAURA: I mean, you grew one of Liam's, Vax's toes
back.

762
00:47:55,637 --> 00:47:57,670
LIAM: That took a long time, though.

763
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,111
TRAVIS: But we really care about Vax, and this guy
can look down at his hand and remember the time

764
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,035
that he worked for some shitty vampires. We leave
it be.

765
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:06,713
MATT: What do you wanna do, Pike?

766
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:08,342
SAM: Has he stabilized, is he stable?

767
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:10,126
ASHLEY: I want to try healing him a little bit.

768
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:12,020
MATT: Okay, so what level Cure Wounds you want to
do?

769
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,806
ASHLEY: Let's do two.

770
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:19,063
MATT: All right, go ahead for a level two Cure
Wounds.

771
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,385
SAM: Can I inspire her healing?

772
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:24,543
MATT: You can, actually, 'cause I'm gonna have a
wisdom check from her in a moment as part of

773
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:25,594
that.

774
00:48:25,594 --> 00:48:28,506
SAM: All right. I'm going to inspire her with a
limerick.

775
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,185
ALL: Ooh!

776
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:33,117
MATT: 2d8 plus five.

777
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,431
LIAM: O'Brien approves.

778
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:41,201
SAM: There once was a gnome from Emon, who sang a
scandalous song, the ladies would swoon, at his

779
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:44,295
rather large tune, and say "My, it's impossibly
long."

780
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:46,530
(laughter)

781
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,524
LAURA: That's beautiful.

782
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:53,612
ASHLEY: Wow, that was so inspiring. 15.

783
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:59,197
MATT: Okay, so you heal 15 points, that's good. Go
ahead and roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier

784
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,578
which I think is plus five, and then add another
d10 to that because of his inspiration.

785
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,600
TRAVIS: Natural--

786
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,150
LAURA: -- 20!

787
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,955
MATT: Roll a d10 just to add on to it, see how--

788
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,744
MARISHA: You got a 20?

789
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:13,813
SAM: This guy's gonna get a brand-new hand!

790
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:17,317
ASHLEY: Three hands! Four.

791
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:26,471
MATT: Okay. So as part of the healing, as you take
his hand, you pull the bandages off, and you can

792
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:32,966
still see the wounds are scabbed over, and it's
healing but it's healing over. As you concentrate

793
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:36,958
for a moment, close your eyes, you can see the
symbol of Sarenrae and that glows for a moment,

794
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:40,967
and that healing energy transfers down your arms
to your forearms, to your fingertips, and into the

795
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:46,412
wound. And his hand begins to give off its own
radiant energy. He freaks out and backs up for a

796
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:47,747
second, but you--

797
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:48,851
ASHLEY: It's okay.

798
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:52,905
MATT: -- keep his hand there, calm him down. As the
light fades, you can see the wound itself is now

799
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:58,749
closed over entirely, and the part where he can
only partially use his thumb and his finger, that

800
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:04,743
section has completely healed over and both his
thumb and his pinky finger are complete now. And

801
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,573
can be used to grab.

802
00:50:06,573 --> 00:50:08,475
ASHLEY: Like a claw, like a crab.

803
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:10,500
MATT: But it's functional! There you go.

804
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,497
ASHLEY: Hang loose, buddy!

805
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:12,993
SAM: He's got shaka hand.

806
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:14,347
LAURA: That's awesome!

807
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:18,287
MATT: Much more useful.

808
00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:21,325
LAURA: And it doesn't hurt anymore.

809
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:23,797
MATT: Nope. No longer needs any dressing
whatsoever.

810
00:50:23,797 --> 00:50:27,584
SAM: Nicely done, Pike! Wow.

811
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:29,938
LIAM: Coin, Percival, coin.

812
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:33,452
LAURA: Stop telling him what to give him.

813
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:35,110
LIAM: You shut up.

814
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,392
TALIESIN: I'm going to make my sister pay.

815
00:50:37,392 --> 00:50:44,331
LAURA: Yes, see. And that way, dear brother, he
won't be on the road with lots of gold in his

816
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:45,821
pocket to get stolen.

817
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,597
SAM: Oh yes, we're looking out for his better
interests.

818
00:50:47,597 --> 00:50:49,687
LIAM: You are so caring.

819
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:52,494
TALIESIN: And I should also mention I don't have
any money at the moment, so this is also--

820
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:55,342
LAURA: That's why we have that fabulous crystal.

821
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:58,764
TALIESIN: I gave your sister all my money. I did!

822
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,228
LAURA: Long time ago.

823
00:51:00,228 --> 00:51:02,930
TALIESIN: Well, it was a long time ago, but it was
all my money.

824
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,513
TRAVIS: About what time is it?

825
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:06,672
LIAM: This conversation is now making me
uncomfortable.

826
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:10,315
MATT: 10:00 or 11:00 in the morning?

827
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:13,847
SAM: Should we go in to meet our jury?

828
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:21,031
LAURA: Oh god. Wait, can I just ask, because we
had three days and I didn't check on it, I had

829
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:24,564
that jewelry box that we stole from the Tylieri
house?

830
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:25,945
MATT: Yes.

831
00:51:25,945 --> 00:51:30,197
LAURA: I didn't ever look in it. Because we just
took it and set it aside. And I have this whole

832
00:51:30,197 --> 00:51:36,484
thing of jewelry. And I also have a bloody bag of
gold and a bag of gems that I never checked in

833
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:37,251
on.

834
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:41,005
MARISHA: Maybe we can just hand over the bloody
bag of gold to Desmond.

835
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,382
SAM: Well, let's look at it first.

836
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:53,523
MATT: The bloody bag of gold, sifting through it,
it contains the equivalent of 230 gold pieces.

837
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:55,310
LAURA: All right.

838
00:51:55,310 --> 00:52:05,493
MATT: The bag of gems, it's a few semi-precious
stones, but then there are a couple of well-carved

839
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:12,154
sapphires, emeralds, couple of nice gems. The
overall worth of that bag probably comes to about

840
00:52:12,154 --> 00:52:13,353
1,200 gold.

841
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:17,767
LAURA: Awesome! And then the jewelry box?

842
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:26,835
MATT: The jewelry box has largely
gold rings, a few gold earrings, the overall worth

843
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:30,594
of the jewelry in there from what you can
ascertain given the time that you were spending

844
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:35,394
with it and your experience with having to hock
and pawn things that you've acquired over your

845
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:39,581
travels, you could probably sell everything in the
jewelry box for about 150 gold.

846
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:42,542
LAURA: Is any of it, you know, magical?

847
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:47,993
MATT: No, there are no magical implements of it.
It is purely just a jewelry box for Tylieri's own

848
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:49,724
collection.

849
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,767
LAURA: I'm keeping the jewelry box, 'cause I want
it.

850
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:53,677
MATT: Okay. It is a nice jewelry box.

851
00:52:53,677 --> 00:52:57,269
LAURA: And I'll add the 150 to our party funds.
Because I'm generous.

852
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:59,166
LIAM: Your greed is endearing.

853
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,338
TALIESIN: <i>I</i> think so.

854
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:06,134
LAURA: All right, yeah, let's go to court.

855
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:09,498
MARISHA: We have our, who has our papers?

856
00:53:09,498 --> 00:53:10,969
LAURA: Scanlan had them.

857
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:12,315
SAM: I have some papers.

858
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:14,456
LIAM: Yes, our diplomat.

859
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:16,050
MARISHA: Bust out the mustache?

860
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,869
LAURA: Oh wait, wait, did we send anybody ahead
with our letters?

861
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:25,115
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, it's probably fine, but I
really don't think we should walk up, just in

862
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,112
case.

863
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:27,945
TALIESIN: I'll do it.

864
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:29,398
LAURA: Yeah, he's, you know.

865
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:32,178
TALIESIN: It's my problem, on a certain level.

866
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:33,525
TRAVIS: I'll go with you.

867
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,659
SAM: What do you mean, you don't want to walk up
to the palace?

868
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:41,225
LIAM: The last time we saw Uriel, he was rather
awful to us, and I think he's probably fine after

869
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:45,852
we took out the Briarwoods, I think, but I'm not a
hundred percent sure and I like my head on its

870
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:46,998
shoulders.

871
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,337
MARISHA: You think he would go that far?

872
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:52,555
LAURA: Potentially. We did leave town.

873
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:54,548
LIAM: I don't know, it's an unknown quantity.

874
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:57,425
TALIESIN: Well, I have some heavy lifting on my
shoulders, I'll take a bit of it on now.

875
00:53:57,425 --> 00:54:00,822
LAURA: All right. We'll just follow behind him and
stay at a distance.

876
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:02,746
TRAVIS: I'll go with him.

877
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:06,178
MATT: So Percy and Grog will helm the walk and the
rest of you will stay back at a distance and keep

878
00:54:06,178 --> 00:54:13,770
a close eye. You guys make your way into Emon, and
the first thing you notice is, as it was recently

879
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:17,953
Winter's Crest, a lot of the decorations are still
up. You see streamers and ribbons of white and

880
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:22,064
blue throughout the city, elements of confetti
that are still being cleaned up off the streets.

881
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:30,117
It is a busy day, being midweek and about
noon-time, so it's also nice to be back home where

882
00:54:30,117 --> 00:54:37,012
you can hear the classic sound of hoofs clopping
on the cobblestone, the shouting of different

883
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:41,488
individuals across the thoroughfare, and you make
your way towards the center of the Cloudtop

884
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:50,654
District. As you guys approach the main gate, the
guards immediately step in front and as you two

885
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:56,382
approach, "Halt, there! Have you business here in
the Cloudtop?" And he looks over at you and goes,

886
00:54:56,382 --> 00:55:05,512
"You're Vox Machina. You're not allowed in here,
and I'd like to know your business, please."

887
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:11,156
TALIESIN: We're here to seek an audience, and we
would be more than happy to have an escort. This

888
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:14,447
is an audience that the king is going to wish to
take.

889
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:17,680
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

890
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,267
LIAM: C'mon, snitch.

891
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:25,971
TALIESIN: Better. 21.

892
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:32,095
MATT: Okay. Looks at the both of you, looks past
and sees the rest of the group a little ways back,

893
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:38,110
looks at the guard companion at the front of the
gate, and goes, "That can be arranged, just no

894
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:42,218
"funny business. The moment you do, this entire
district's gonna be down on your head."

895
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:44,399
TALIESIN: We have no intention of anything funny.

896
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:53,221
MATT: "Good, good." He puts his thumb up, and you
hear the chains (rattling) and the portcullis

897
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:58,393
begins to lift that leads into the central area of
the Cloudtop District. You guys step back into the

898
00:55:58,393 --> 00:56:03,808
familiar area, the streets here much cleaner, the
cobblestone much fresher-- this is where the more

899
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:12,152
upper-class and elite of Emon stay, live, and keep
most of their business. You make your way through

900
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:18,196
with the two guards flanking you guys, and you can
see four more coming down from nearby parts of the

901
00:56:18,196 --> 00:56:23,243
wall, and flank you guys from the back to make
sure that you're encased and taken care of. As you

902
00:56:23,243 --> 00:56:26,778
walk through the streets, what turned out to be an
arrival is almost a procession, as individuals are

903
00:56:26,778 --> 00:56:32,994
now coming out and seeing this group of you guys
walking through the street and peek out. Some of

904
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:38,069
the local nobles and such, some seem to recognize
you and go "Oh!" and dart back in. There was a

905
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:41,828
woman you spoke to a couple years ago, it was an
older, spinster-type woman who was planning a

906
00:56:41,828 --> 00:56:46,850
wedding for her daughter. She waves for a second
and goes to talk to you guys real fast, and then

907
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,650
one of the guards raises a pike towards her and
goes "Mmm."

908
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,718
TALIESIN: Later, later. It's going to be fine.

909
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:58,964
MATT: "All right, hmm." She walks back off.
"Curious." You are led past the Citrine Garrison,

910
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:05,733
through the central palace, up the front steps
that lead to the doorway, the gates that are

911
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:13,441
currently opened. You are led into the central
foyer chamber of the central palace, and as you

912
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:20,024
are brought to that point, you can immediately see
the guards on the inside step forward and have a

913
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:22,383
whispering conversation with the gentleman--

914
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:23,739
LAURA: I can read lips.

915
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:24,730
MATT: You can.

916
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,297
LAURA: What do they say?

917
00:57:26,297 --> 00:57:28,203
TALIESIN: Touché.

918
00:57:28,203 --> 00:57:37,367
MATT: The conversation entails: "Vox Machina has
returned to Emon. They are requesting an audience

919
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:42,453
"with Uriel." The other guard says: "Last bit of
documentation we've received was they were to be

920
00:57:42,453 --> 00:57:49,056
"arrested on sight." The first says: "I know, I
know, but Uriel rescinded that recently. He said

921
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:55,033
"if they show up to bring them in. They don't seem
to be aggressive at all. If they're now going to

922
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:58,746
"do anything stupid we could just kill them here,
so they know better than to do anything stupid."

923
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:06,230
The other guard person goes: "You're right, but
I've seen what they can do. Bring out whoever you

924
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:13,642
"have on shift." And as they step away, "This way,
please!" and you can see the guard that was with

925
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:18,531
you splinters off from the rest of the party and
as you guys walk down the hallway, a few moments

926
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:25,167
later, about 20 guards begin to come out from the
nearby hallways, and follow behind you. And it--

927
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:29,222
LIAM: I see a guard I recognize and I go: "Oh, I
got my snake!"

928
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:35,810
MATT: And he goes: "Oh, ha, yeah, good." And
another guy pats him on the shoulder and he puts

929
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,834
his spear back in place.

930
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,441
TRAVIS: See, everything's fine, it's a lovely
welcoming party.

931
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:43,373
LIAM: I'm thoroughly impressed.

932
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:54,930
MATT: The throne doors open, entering the
skylight-- the noonday sun now pouring beams of

933
00:58:54,930 --> 00:59:01,480
light into the central chamber. You can see,
stepping towards the central dais is Uriel

934
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,515
Tal'Dorei, who has not been there previously, and
apparently has been recently summoned to the

935
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:10,795
chamber through your arrival. As he steps up and
sits in his chair, he notices you guys entering

936
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:15,751
with the guards, and nods his head for a moment
and looks off to the side, and approaching him to

937
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:24,731
join him on top of the platform is Seeker Asum,
who apparently has returned, with his shaven

938
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:32,043
halfling head, with his tattoos on the side, and
Arbiter Brom, the cleric of Ioun who oversaw part

939
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:34,211
of your guys' initial trial here in the castle
chambers--

940
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:36,784
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, yeah, he was under their
control, I think.

941
00:59:36,784 --> 00:59:42,516
MATT: And then after them, you see Guardian Tofor
Brotorus, who is the silver-scaled female

942
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:47,869
dragonborn, who is currently the head of the
town's guard.

943
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:49,223
MARISHA: Tofor, what was her last name?

944
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,458
MATT: Brotorus.

945
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:55,623
LAURA: Man, I need to organize my notes better.
Got it all written down somewhere.

946
00:59:55,623 --> 01:00:00,743
MARISHA: So this is essentially our jury? Judge?
Judgment party?

947
01:00:00,743 --> 01:00:05,987
MATT: It's most of it, from the last time you guys
were here, yeah. As you guys are brought forward,

948
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:09,663
the guards stop, and let you continue the rest of
your pathway forward, you step up to the--

949
01:00:09,663 --> 01:00:10,935
TALIESIN: I step up.

950
01:00:10,935 --> 01:00:13,656
MATT: Okay, is Percival the only one that's gonna
step up?

951
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:14,704
TRAVIS: I stay with him.

952
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:16,054
LAURA: Wait, what are you doing?

953
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:17,110
TALIESIN: I'm stepping up.

954
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,285
LAURA: I'll step up behind you.

955
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:23,637
LIAM: I pull her a little further along with me,
and we step up.

956
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:30,037
MATT: As those of you who wish to then step up to
the front of the dais, Uriel sits up and puts his

957
01:00:30,037 --> 01:00:32,159
hand out to tell you to stop where you are.

958
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:34,410
TALIESIN: I genuflect.

959
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,226
LAURA: I follow suit.

960
01:00:36,226 --> 01:00:44,191
MATT: He waves his hand. "It's all right, don't
worry." And he puts his hands together like this,

961
01:00:44,191 --> 01:00:48,523
and he seems very thoughtful for a moment, and the
silence that pierces the room leaves this

962
01:00:48,523 --> 01:01:00,316
underlying tension, this awkward bit of wondering.
This build of tension begins to fill the room

963
01:01:00,316 --> 01:01:12,421
before he goes: "First and foremost, I owe each
and every one of you the deepest apologies. I've

964
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:19,028
"only recently cleared my head of a cloud of poor
judgment, one that apparently wasn't one of my own

965
01:01:19,028 --> 01:01:30,438
"making." And you can see, he looks genuinely
distraught. There's bags under his eyes a little

966
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:35,501
bit, like he hasn't been sleeping well, and you
can see one of the servants go: "Shall we bring

967
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:45,281
"Salda?" He says: "No, no, it's all right. When
last we spoke, we had a trial, many things that

968
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:53,465
"were brought to our attention. In the time of your
absence, in hoping that you would find means of

969
01:01:53,465 --> 01:02:02,134
"absolving yourselves of these charges, Seeker Asum
here traveled out about to Wildemount to do his

970
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:12,188
"own bit of informatory gathering. He returned
about a week ago, and just as I was attempting to

971
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:21,233
"sort out this haze-- Asum, if you would please."
And he rests his hands for a second, and Asum

972
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:30,013
steps forward and puts his hood back and closes
his hands before him. "First of all, a gracious

973
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:37,767
"welcome to you, Vox Machina and friends. I did my
digging in Wildemount, specifically Wynandir and

974
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:43,355
"Port Damali, near the southwest coast of the
Shearing Channel. Inquiries by myself and my

975
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:49,531
"gatherers before me revealed that the Briarwoods,
while once respected in that community, had been

976
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:54,976
"accused of necromancy about six years before, a
practice that had long been outlawed in

977
01:02:54,976 --> 01:03:01,719
"Wildemount. Their estate and all lands were to be
seized by King Dwendal, but the Briarwoods were

978
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:06,200
"officially killed when their homestead was burned
by a mob."

979
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,747
SAM: By what?

980
01:03:07,747 --> 01:03:15,131
MATT: "By a mob. All official documentation in
Wildemount on the Briarwoods was set in this day,

981
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:21,971
"and that we the end of their line. However, this
information was kept from ever making its way

982
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:30,382
"across the shore, as there isn't a lot of business
between Wildemount and Emon. Upon doing more

983
01:03:30,382 --> 01:03:38,345
"digging, in Port Damali, months later, it seemed
that individuals matching their appearance

984
01:03:38,345 --> 01:03:46,369
"appeared briefly within the Port, where they
bought a ship and hired a crew. Now there was no

985
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:54,313
"political knowledge in Wildemount, or any approval
of a bridge being built, either. This announcement

986
01:03:54,313 --> 01:04:00,254
"from the Briarwoods, whom had previously been
silent, came about the time that I'd sent two of

987
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:08,681
"my gatherers to look around, and never returned. I
theorized that this entire presentation to Emon,

988
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:17,927
"and these political handshakes, were a means to
avoid suspicion. I don't know what to, or to what

989
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:26,717
"means, but the timing seemed a bit conspicuous to
me. Those were my findings in Wildemount, and

990
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:35,936
"based on our last discussion, it appears that Lord
Briarwood seemed to contain some semblance of

991
01:04:35,936 --> 01:04:45,361
"mind-affecting prowess. I myself befell to it, as
did our Sovereign here. Thankfully, it came to its

992
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:52,413
"end recently." And you can see there's a nod and a
deep sigh of guilt that emanates from Uriel.

993
01:04:52,413 --> 01:05:00,938
"Anyway, that is the gist of my findings while you
were off in Whitestone. Sovereign." And he steps

994
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:06,355
back, and Uriel raises his head, leaning forward
with his elbows on the edge of his knees, still

995
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:15,914
sitting on his throne. "It's also been brought to
my attention that the attack within my walls was

996
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:25,068
"indeed instigated by the Briarwoods themselves,
and that Sylas is vampiric in nature. This is the

997
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:31,953
"influence that clouded me. This is twice now that
I have found myself, in spite of all of my

998
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:41,992
"protections and intents to defend this city, that
I have fallen prey to the wills and whims of some

999
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:59,666
"infernal intent. And that is not a way to breed
respect or trust in one's leader. I have a lot to

1000
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:09,409
"think about. Regardless, let it stand that as of
this moment, Vox Machina is immediately returned

1001
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:13,734
"to their place on the council, and all charges
against them dropped."

1002
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:16,072
TRAVIS: Yeah! Sorry.

1003
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:27,806
MATT: "So. We've also received a bit of word that
you were successful in returning Whitestone to

1004
01:06:27,806 --> 01:06:33,734
"some semblance of new order. Please, if you
would."

1005
01:06:33,734 --> 01:06:40,984
TALIESIN: If you would, your majesty, yes, first
of all Whitestone is once again ruled by the de

1006
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:42,310
Rolo family.

1007
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,741
MATT: "It is good to know."

1008
01:06:43,741 --> 01:06:53,886
TALIESIN: And I must also, at this point, offer
our own apologies which are in order. While there

1009
01:06:53,886 --> 01:07:00,304
was a supernatural flame of distrust in your
heart, it couldn't have been ignited without the

1010
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:08,038
embers of our own rash judgements, and poor
choices. It is difficult for men of action to

1011
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:13,417
necessarily pay attention to the smaller details
of their world and their realities, and for this we do

1012
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:19,577
apologize. I wish I could say it would be the last
of it, but again, it is a difficult world, and we

1013
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:29,017
are prone to action, and for that you have our
apologies. I would also offer, my lord, that

1014
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:38,377
perhaps these infernal powers are attracted by
your innate goodness, and that would be worth

1015
01:07:38,377 --> 01:07:40,073
meditating upon.

1016
01:07:40,073 --> 01:07:53,249
MATT: "I appreciate your counsel, Percival.
(sighs) Well, if there is the de Rolos still in

1017
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,226
"rule, then are you to return to Whitestone?"

1018
01:07:55,226 --> 01:08:04,195
TALIESIN: I am not. There is another de Rolo. The
Briarwoods were sloppy in their extermination of

1019
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:09,255
my line and family. Cassandra de Rolo now rules,
along with a--

1020
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:12,358
SAM: Triumvirate?

1021
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:14,215
TALIESIN: Triumvirate, I suppose?

1022
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,270
SAM: Council?

1023
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:22,830
TALIESIN: Council of leaders pushing to build the
economy once again, in that sense I'm sure they

1024
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:30,105
would be delighted by the opening of trade, and
perhaps continuing with the plans for a bridge.

1025
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:35,247
Worth discussing at the very least with the new
rulers of Whitestone.

1026
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:39,996
MATT: "We will, very much, endeavor to extend as
much aid as we can to the rebuilding of

1027
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:49,054
"Whitestone. As to the bridge, this may be more of
a matter of us working with the powers of

1028
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:54,482
"Wildemount, as we were under the impression that
that was being handled by the Briarwoods. But we

1029
01:08:54,482 --> 01:09:04,069
"shall pursue this, as this would still be a great
boon to our countryside. Well, thank you, thank

1030
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,626
"you for coming."

1031
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:11,467
SAM: Excuse me, Sovereign Uriel, perhaps I'm
speaking out of turn here, and I haven't consulted

1032
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:19,783
with my fellows here, but you did mention that
you've been mind-controlled twice now, and as

1033
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:26,868
council members, this doesn't sit well, and--

1034
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,599
MATT: "I understand."

1035
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:33,403
SAM: Well, what are we to do? The security that
you have in place clearly hasn't worked. Is there

1036
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:39,394
a role that we can serve to ensure that you will
be further protected?

1037
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:47,374
LIAM: If I may, Vox Machina would not be here
today without the aid and advice of Lady Allura,

1038
01:09:47,374 --> 01:09:55,982
and I would like to personally testify on her
behalf of her ability and her wisdom, and her

1039
01:09:55,982 --> 01:10:05,071
heart. I feel she has a great place in this city,
and you should put great trust in her,

1040
01:10:05,071 --> 01:10:12,316
specifically. She will do much good by you,
Sovereign.

1041
01:10:12,316 --> 01:10:17,765
LAURA: Plus they may be able to enchant your crown
so it has some, you know, special mind-control

1042
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:19,016
fighting abilities.

1043
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:20,614
SAM: She's spit-balling here, it doesn't have to
be that.

1044
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:22,320
LAURA: Just, you know, throwing out some ideas.
That's all.

1045
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,750
TRAVIS: That could be nice. Yeah.

1046
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:32,360
MATT: "This is being looked into, as previously
was thought that such an enchantment was already

1047
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:41,412
"provided. It appears the magic went inert, and a
re-enchantment is being looked into. And your

1048
01:10:41,412 --> 01:10:53,232
"advisement on Allura's great deal of respect,
influence, has been noted, as it has for the

1049
01:10:53,232 --> 01:10:57,501
"entirety of her length here as part of the
council. When she returns from Whitestone, I

1050
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:03,094
"intend to see that she is properly rewarded and
regarded in this forum."

1051
01:11:03,094 --> 01:11:05,848
LIAM: My mother would have said she is a good
egg.

1052
01:11:05,848 --> 01:11:10,940
MATT: "That she is. That she is."

1053
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,540
TRAVIS: Should we hand over the rest of our--

1054
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:18,861
SAM: Evidence? Documents for the archives. We did
collect quite a bit of paperwork, and

1055
01:11:18,861 --> 01:11:26,970
documentation that would fill in any of the gaps
in the history of Whitestone, and--

1056
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:31,777
MATT: He leans forward and puts his hand out.
"Please, anything--"

1057
01:11:31,777 --> 01:11:36,204
SAM: Of course, we gathered this from the palace
in Whitestone.

1058
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:50,978
MATT: Thumbing through the paperwork. "It's not--
Asum." He hands it over and Asum takes a moment of

1059
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:57,712
quiet to himself to thumb through, and he's very
carefully inspecting and looking about the edges.

1060
01:11:57,712 --> 01:12:00,003
LAURA: Are you looking for something specific?

1061
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:07,456
MATT: "I'm currently confirming handwriting. One
that I deal with quite often."

1062
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:14,971
LAURA: Oh, yes, actually, that is something we
discovered on our own.

1063
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:20,182
MATT: "My liege, these papers do appear to be
genuine, and that does indeed appear to be the

1064
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:24,127
"handwriting of Riskel Daxio."

1065
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:27,411
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry.

1066
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:39,190
MATT: Uriel takes the papers back and, "It's not--
he's been at my side since I was young. His

1067
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:49,517
"father, Mikael, helms our forces at Fort Daxio.
Guards! Find and seize Riskel Daxio at once." The

1068
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:53,542
guards immediately go to action, bringing their
weapons and scattering outside of the throne room.

1069
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:58,639
You can hear the clanging of footsteps, heavy
footfalls, and weapons and shields banging as they

1070
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:01,323
start just scattering about the entire palace
around you.

1071
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,886
TRAVIS: Hate to be him right now.

1072
01:13:02,886 --> 01:13:04,905
SAM: Did you just say that there's a fort
somewhere?

1073
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:05,974
MARISHA: Fort Daxio?

1074
01:13:05,974 --> 01:13:12,353
MATT: "Fort Daxio. It's our northern military
post. It's by the Cliffkeep Mountains. Lots of

1075
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:17,709
"very dangerous things reside up there, giant
creatures, and he holds the border. He's the

1076
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:20,571
"adopted father of Riskel, not his actual--"

1077
01:13:20,571 --> 01:13:28,293
SAM: But any connection to this traitor may-- it
may be dangerous for him to be in command up

1078
01:13:28,293 --> 01:13:30,551
there. This whole place could be a risk.

1079
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:33,980
MATT: "I shall look into it. They haven't spoken
in quite a long time, and as far as I know there

1080
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:39,056
"wasn't a lot of love between the two. Besides,
Mikael is not at the Fort right now, Mikael is

1081
01:13:39,056 --> 01:13:43,041
"down in Syngorn on a diplomatic military
mission."

1082
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:49,828
TALIESIN: Your majesty, I know well the betrayal
you feel, and I urge caution.

1083
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:52,856
MATT: "Caution it is."

1084
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:54,982
TRAVIS: Don't forget about Kibble.

1085
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:58,495
LAURA: Oh, that's right, I guess we don't need him
to testify--

1086
01:13:58,495 --> 01:14:04,499
SAM: Well we should bring him out just to, just
'cause-- Otherwise he just sat around for

1087
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:05,398
nothing.

1088
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:09,141
MATT: You look behind and Desmond is standing
behind you all, wide-eyed and so confused and

1089
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:12,158
overwhelmed by everything that's happening, and
just eagerly awaiting for you to fill him in--

1090
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:18,573
TALIESIN: This young man was an unfortunate victim
of my wrath when the Briarwoods visited. He is a

1091
01:14:18,573 --> 01:14:20,174
citizen of Whitestone, and--

1092
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:23,865
MATT: "Yes, yes I was told of this, the
carriage-man that you had attacked."

1093
01:14:23,865 --> 01:14:29,306
TALIESIN: I would like to have him be the official
letter carrier for any-- the first set of

1094
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:32,168
correspondence to the new rulers of Whitecastle,
so since he--

1095
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,481
SAM: Stone.

1096
01:14:33,481 --> 01:14:35,353
TALIESIN: Whitestone. My god, I'm hungry.

1097
01:14:35,353 --> 01:14:38,399
LIAM: Oh no! So if you could send an order of
sliders--

1098
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:39,550
TALIESIN: About 12.

1099
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,721
MARISHA: Don't forget the mustard.

1100
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:43,836
TALIESIN: I'm coming up with this shit. It's not
easy.

1101
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:46,511
TRAVIS: Might need some gut healing after those.

1102
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:49,411
TALIESIN: I know. Constitution roll.

1103
01:14:49,411 --> 01:14:51,101
(fart noise)

1104
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:59,616
TALIESIN: Would it be reasonable to appoint him as
our first correspondence messenger, since he must

1105
01:14:59,616 --> 01:15:01,697
return home at the very least?

1106
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:07,041
MATT: "Yes. I would still wish to send him with a
few of our trusted soldiers to keep him safe. The

1107
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:11,950
"roads are not safe between here and Whitestone in
general, and I mean no offense to you, young sir,

1108
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,761
"but you don't look able with a weapon."

1109
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:16,517
LAURA: Especially not against harpies.

1110
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:24,554
TALIESIN: I should also mention that my lineage
has now been restored to me, and I am now of royal

1111
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:30,269
descent once again. And so, again, with my
companions' permission, and we will discuss this

1112
01:15:30,269 --> 01:15:37,550
in the future, but I would like to put forward the
beginnings of the proper paperwork to perhaps have

1113
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:45,179
Greyskull Keep designated as an embassy, with all
the privileges and rights that that presumes.

1114
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:47,233
ASHLEY: What does that mean?

1115
01:15:47,233 --> 01:15:50,546
MATT: "That could, no, that will be arranged."

1116
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,568
TALIESIN: I will confer with my peers.

1117
01:15:53,568 --> 01:15:55,437
LIAM: You're on Whitestone soil.

1118
01:15:55,437 --> 01:16:04,528
SAM: Before we give Desmond his appointment as a
royal messenger, which I guess he is, would the

1119
01:16:04,528 --> 01:16:14,516
kingdom-- he risked much to keep himself alive and
possibly to testify on our behalf-- would the

1120
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:20,628
kingdom be willing to give him a quick little
reward for his time spent in captivity?

1121
01:16:20,628 --> 01:16:22,723
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

1122
01:16:22,723 --> 01:16:30,507
SAM: Not great. 24.

1123
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:32,222
MATT: Not great.

1124
01:16:32,222 --> 01:16:34,188
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

1125
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:40,930
MATT: He gives a nod and looks to Desmond.
"Certainly. It's only fair. You've travelled this

1126
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:47,950
"far and undergone much personal difficulty in
aiding us and relieving this darkness in our

1127
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:55,197
"territory, and yours as well. I would like to
grant upon him by my estate as Sovereign Uriel a

1128
01:16:55,197 --> 01:16:58,706
"granted gift of 1,000 gold pieces to be sent on
his way."

1129
01:16:58,706 --> 01:17:00,869
SAM: That's more than what we would've done by far!

1130
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:04,932
MATT: Desmond's like: "I-I--"

1131
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:07,140
SAM: Don't faint!

1132
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,227
MARISHA: Don't spend it all in one place, bruh.

1133
01:17:09,227 --> 01:17:16,459
TALIESIN: Desmond? The debt that I owe you is
larger than coin, and is--

1134
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:18,195
MATT: "That's a lot of coins, huh?"

1135
01:17:18,195 --> 01:17:23,048
TALIESIN: And it's ongoing, so if you can think of
how-- what sort of trade you would like to spend

1136
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:28,261
your next years of life pursuing, whether it be
in--

1137
01:17:28,261 --> 01:17:31,312
LAURA: Probably not lute-playing, I'm gonna just
throw that out there.

1138
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:34,133
TRAVIS: (laughs) Wow. Fucking cold.

1139
01:17:34,133 --> 01:17:36,050
TALIESIN: Drums it is! Drums it is.

1140
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,612
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1141
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:42,113
TALIESIN: You are a terrible person. I'm a
terrible person, but you're the worst.

1142
01:17:42,113 --> 01:17:47,381
TRAVIS: Even I am taken aback. My jaw is just open
like: (gasps).

1143
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:53,099
MATT: There's an awkward tense pause for a moment
as everyone looks over to Vex, including Uriel.

1144
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:57,725
Seeker Asum stifles a chuckle.

1145
01:17:57,725 --> 01:18:04,682
LIAM: Do you know what's amazing, Sovereign, is
that Vex'ahlia and Percival were just talking

1146
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:12,409
earlier today and they promised each other to
match whatever you offered this boy, and I am

1147
01:18:12,409 --> 01:18:15,566
amazed at their generosity and kindness--

1148
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,530
LAURA: I walk rocks hand him, on the back of his
arm, just like that.

1149
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:27,517
MATT: Uriel nods, "That is generous." At which
point, two--

1150
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:30,312
TALIESIN: Whatever work you would wish, Desmond, is
available to you.

1151
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:35,176
MATT: Two guards rush in at this point, and
whisper something into his ear, which, Vex, you

1152
01:18:35,176 --> 01:18:42,494
see their lips moving, as that's what you can do.
The verbiage comes across as-- actually, no.

1153
01:18:42,494 --> 01:18:45,960
SAM: Oh! Oh oh! The first whisper of 2016!

1154
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,730
TALIESIN: Breaking in the new year!

1155
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,643
MARISHA: Watch the flask.

1156
01:18:52,643 --> 01:18:56,068
LIAM: "I'm making this up as I go! I don't know
what I'm doing."

1157
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:58,057
TALIESIN: "Look surprised!"

1158
01:18:58,057 --> 01:18:59,492
SAM: "I'm a fraud!"

1159
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:08,254
TALIESIN: "I've got a reddit page open behind my
DM screen."

1160
01:19:08,254 --> 01:19:16,668
MATT: Okay! Climbing over a camera. So Uriel's
eyes go wide for a moment, nods. "All right." The

1161
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:22,358
guards rush back off, and, "Well, if there's
anything else, I believe this concludes our

1162
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:23,630
"business."

1163
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,369
LAURA: Of course.

1164
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:27,642
SAM: Is there anything else we need or require?

1165
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,644
TALIESIN: I think we're perfectly well-suited for
now.

1166
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:31,639
LIAM: Is Desmond off to Whitestone?

1167
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,984
MATT: Desmond nods. "I imagine so."

1168
01:19:34,984 --> 01:19:37,214
LIAM: Oh, Vex'ahlia, you'd best give him that
1,000 gold now--

1169
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:40,319
LAURA: I would right now, but I don't have any on
me, how crazy is that?

1170
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,653
TRAVIS: Oh that is such a shame, I know, I almost
thought about reminding you to bring your extra--

1171
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:50,669
TALIESIN: Since I am also gold-poor, I'm writing
it into the letter to my sister that we owe money,

1172
01:19:50,669 --> 01:19:55,871
that they are to employ him in any way he sees
fit.

1173
01:19:55,871 --> 01:20:00,523
MATT: An individual of the Court has just come up
and handed him a sack of gold coins and he hasn't

1174
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:01,993
even-- he's not listening to you.

1175
01:20:01,993 --> 01:20:04,826
LAURA: Hide it around. Put some in your shorts,
put some in your shoes--

1176
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:06,292
TRAVIS: Yeah, tuck it down by your nuts, eh?

1177
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:12,125
MATT: He puts some down the front of his pants and
pulls his little belt tight. "I-I, um--"

1178
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,705
TRAVIS: Keeps it safe, makes a lady take a double
look.

1179
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:20,021
TALIESIN: I also made sure in the letter that they
know that he is returning to Whitestone with this

1180
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:26,322
money, so that if he, somehow-- if it's mismanaged
by any of the guards or otherwise that it will be

1181
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,536
taken care of.

1182
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:31,364
MATT: He is escorted by two of the guards to his
temporary chambers here at the palace.

1183
01:20:31,364 --> 01:20:39,497
LAURA: Uriel, we'll leave you to your business,
but if you need any help finding anyone, we're

1184
01:20:39,497 --> 01:20:41,861
here for you.

1185
01:20:41,861 --> 01:20:53,600
MATT: Thinks for a minute. "I know you just
returned. You've already done so much. But it has

1186
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,915
"come to my attention that Riskel Daxio apparently
has fled the palace, or at least has not been seen

1187
01:20:59,915 --> 01:21:07,801
"for a number of days. I've set the guards on it,
and Seeker Asum, you as well, see if you can

1188
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:14,252
"gather as much information as you can-- but if you
find it within your capabilities to seek any

1189
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:20,759
"information regarding his whereabouts and possibly
bring him to justice, I would be very grateful and

1190
01:21:20,759 --> 01:21:26,350
"happy to reward for the destruction of this
traitor."

1191
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,688
TRAVIS: Yeah. (satisfied laugh)

1192
01:21:28,688 --> 01:21:30,608
LAURA: Of course.

1193
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:33,566
SAM: Do you have any intelligence that he's still
within the city walls, or?

1194
01:21:33,566 --> 01:21:37,332
MATT: "It's only been a few days, so, I haven't,
no--"

1195
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:39,235
SAM: Could be anywhere.

1196
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:43,088
MATT: "We're trying to find out now. You may move
swifter than my guard, if previous experience has

1197
01:21:43,088 --> 01:21:47,838
"taught me anything." He looks over to some of his
guards who are like, what?

1198
01:21:47,838 --> 01:21:51,658
TRAVIS: "Ah sir, we're standing right here!"

1199
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:55,515
TALIESIN: You guys are doing a great job, you're
great, you look great, you're doing great, you're

1200
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:56,926
great, thank you.

1201
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,886
LIAM: "Man, we ain't found shit."

1202
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:03,943
MATT: At this point, Guardian Tofor reaches over
and says, "My liege, if I might also be excused to

1203
01:22:03,943 --> 01:22:08,165
"do my own search, I would appreciate that." "But
of course, Guardian, please, go on your way." And

1204
01:22:08,165 --> 01:22:16,034
she scatters off. The rest of the council looks
about, and glances at the rest of you. Uriel

1205
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:22,232
stands up from his throne, "Very well. Thank you,
and you're all dismissed from this council

1206
01:22:22,232 --> 01:22:28,851
"meeting." And he stands up and begins walking off
with Seeker Asum at his side, quickly talking up

1207
01:22:28,851 --> 01:22:32,782
to him and they're both having this heated
discussion as they leave out to the western side

1208
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,787
of the throne room.

1209
01:22:34,787 --> 01:22:37,893
TRAVIS: Are there any other guards in the room as
we leave?

1210
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:42,981
MATT: There are four other guards, two appointed
to the front door and there are two at the sides

1211
01:22:42,981 --> 01:22:44,447
of the central throne.

1212
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:50,027
TRAVIS: I look at the guards at the door and I go,
told ya!

1213
01:22:50,027 --> 01:22:57,746
MATT: They both step back for a minute from the
booming voice out of nowhere, and, "Yeah."

1214
01:22:57,746 --> 01:23:00,820
(laughter)

1215
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:04,026
SAM: All right, so we're free.

1216
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:06,593
TALIESIN: That went well.

1217
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:10,557
LAURA: Better than I expected, to be sure.

1218
01:23:10,557 --> 01:23:13,267
TRAVIS: I wasn't worried. Who are we tracking
down?

1219
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:17,366
LAURA: The dickhead that built our frigging keep!

1220
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:22,716
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, I'm wondering: if I was a
sneaky bastard--

1221
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:25,092
SAM: You're not, don't say that about yourself.

1222
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:28,117
MARISHA: Thank you so much. I sometimes get
concerned.

1223
01:23:28,117 --> 01:23:29,968
TALIESIN: I know where you're going with this, you
should finish the thought.

1224
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:32,270
MARISHA: If I was a sneaky bastard, and I wanted
to make sure--

1225
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:33,554
SAM: You're not.

1226
01:23:33,554 --> 01:23:41,083
MARISHA: Thank you. And if I were to make sure
(laughs) I had an emergency escape route outside

1227
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:48,069
of the city, and was maybe tasked to build, I
don't know, say, our keep, within the last year, I

1228
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:50,986
feel like we need to start at home here.

1229
01:23:50,986 --> 01:23:57,221
LAURA: Yeah, I mean he's built-- he's built a lot,
but I assume he's probably built secret entrances

1230
01:23:57,221 --> 01:23:58,766
into different places.

1231
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:04,218
MARISHA: Because our keep is butted up against the
border of the city and everywhere else.

1232
01:24:04,218 --> 01:24:06,175
TALIESIN: Do we have the blueprints to Greyskull
Keep?

1233
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:07,507
MARISHA: Yeah, can we get them?

1234
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:09,841
TRAVIS: They won't be on there.

1235
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:13,944
TALIESIN: No, but being able to study them we
might find places where--

1236
01:24:13,944 --> 01:24:20,849
SAM: You're thinking that he's hiding in our keep
somewhere?

1237
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:23,251
MARISHA: No, I think he escaped through our keep.

1238
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:26,267
TALIESIN: Or he might have hidden an escape--
there might be things about our keep we don't

1239
01:24:26,267 --> 01:24:27,180
know.

1240
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,579
LIAM: I mean, could I take a week and really size
up the entire building?

1241
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:32,602
MATT: Which building?

1242
01:24:32,602 --> 01:24:36,567
LIAM: The keep. For little sneaky holes that I
didn't know were there.

1243
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:38,383
TALIESIN: We'll get the blueprints just to help.

1244
01:24:38,383 --> 01:24:41,468
TRAVIS: Did we even ask where we last saw Riskel
whatever?

1245
01:24:41,468 --> 01:24:44,199
LAURA: Can I search his room? Are we allowed to
do that? I mean, he did ask--

1246
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:49,790
MARISHA: Yeah, can we ask for transparency and
information exchange or something like that with

1247
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:55,361
these people? So that we can come in and out of
the Cloudtop District? Are we cool there?

1248
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:58,795
MATT: You're cool now. Yeah, all the charges have
been dropped.

1249
01:24:58,795 --> 01:25:01,172
TALIESIN: We're representatives of a foreign
government.

1250
01:25:01,172 --> 01:25:11,526
MARISHA: Okay, cool. So here's my other question.
The Briarwoods wanted something with Emon. That

1251
01:25:11,526 --> 01:25:13,752
had nothing to do with building a bridge, right?

1252
01:25:13,752 --> 01:25:14,924
TALIESIN: What did they want?

1253
01:25:14,924 --> 01:25:16,060
MARISHA: What did they want?

1254
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:22,343
MATT: Seeker Asum found information that it seems
that the whole bridge conversation--

1255
01:25:22,343 --> 01:25:23,523
MARISHA: Was like a ruse?

1256
01:25:23,523 --> 01:25:29,384
MATT: It was a ruse that arose-- well, it arose
because he began to send agents into Whitestone to

1257
01:25:29,384 --> 01:25:38,445
find out what was happening, and he believes 
they discovered that Emon was now looking at them,

1258
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:44,293
and so they reached out to try and distract or
prevent them from going any further. So as opposed

1259
01:25:44,293 --> 01:25:49,536
to being just quiet and accepting this outside
attention, they cut it off at the head and went

1260
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:56,585
like, "Hey! Let's talk about how we can work
together as a way to try and not keep this weird,

1261
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,254
"constant influx of spies."

1262
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:03,961
MARISHA: So the Briarwoods coming to Emon is
assumed to be just a formality? That's all they

1263
01:26:03,961 --> 01:26:05,155
were here for?

1264
01:26:05,155 --> 01:26:06,290
TRAVIS: A distraction.

1265
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:12,794
MATT: To continue to raise belief in that
conversation. It may not be the case, but that

1266
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:13,945
was--

1267
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:17,688
MARISHA: But why send-- why would I go? Why would
you go? Why not send a representative? You know

1268
01:26:17,688 --> 01:26:18,973
what I mean?

1269
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:20,647
LAURA: So you can gain better control.

1270
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:22,185
TRAVIS: So you can work your magic.

1271
01:26:22,185 --> 01:26:23,617
LIAM: Validity.

1272
01:26:23,617 --> 01:26:29,465
LAURA: Anyway, I want to go check out his room.

1273
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:38,006
MATT: Okay. Riskel was also in charge of security
within the palace. And part of the notes that you

1274
01:26:38,006 --> 01:26:41,756
had received about him talked about discussing
back and forth with the Briarwoods in preparation

1275
01:26:41,756 --> 01:26:47,340
for their arrival, to make sure that most of the
magical wards and defenses that were usually set up

1276
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,861
there were all removed or false.

1277
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:56,912
SAM: Wait a second, so we're gonna go check out
his room to see if we can find clues, but also,

1278
01:26:56,912 --> 01:27:06,289
who would know? Is there anyone that we know who
would know-- would Gilmore know where this guy has

1279
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:07,081
gone?

1280
01:27:07,081 --> 01:27:08,978
TALIESIN: You just really want to see Gilmore.

1281
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:10,688
LAURA: Why would Gilmore know?

1282
01:27:10,688 --> 01:27:13,519
SAM: Because he knows everything about everyone.

1283
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:15,993
TALIESIN: He just has really nice hair.

1284
01:27:15,993 --> 01:27:18,375
SAM: Isn't that the same thing?

1285
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:21,109
TALIESIN: It's different from actually knowing
things.

1286
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:28,133
LIAM: I honestly think that if Asum doesn't know,
nobody knows. Asum is our source of information

1287
01:27:28,133 --> 01:27:29,014
here.

1288
01:27:29,014 --> 01:27:31,088
MARISHA: Well you know what they say when you
Asum.

1289
01:27:31,088 --> 01:27:38,069
(weak laughter)

1290
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:42,633
LAURA: He's just staring at you.

1291
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:48,797
MATT: So, as you make your way over to-- (laughs)
as you make your way over to Riskel Daxio's room,

1292
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:53,374
there are two guards out the front. You can hear
things being rummaged around through inside. You

1293
01:27:53,374 --> 01:27:57,337
can see a couple guards are picking apart his
room, and at first glance as you step up, they see

1294
01:27:57,337 --> 01:27:59,502
you, and the guards step aside.

1295
01:27:59,502 --> 01:28:01,187
LAURA: Council members coming through.

1296
01:28:01,187 --> 01:28:02,570
SAM: Take five.

1297
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,471
MATT: The guards stop rummaging as you enter. You
can see cabinets and stuff have been pulled out,

1298
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:12,043
bedsheets have been turned over. Most of the room
appears to have been left untouched, except for

1299
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:19,055
most of his belongings-- anything that would have
worth is empty. Most of his drawers are empty. You

1300
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:24,112
can see already, there is what looks to be a small
chest that is open and empty on the ground.

1301
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:27,349
LIAM: Well, I'm gonna perception check that
shit.

1302
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:28,685
MATT: Go for it.

1303
01:28:28,685 --> 01:28:30,317
LAURA: I'm gonna perception check the whole room
to see--

1304
01:28:30,317 --> 01:28:31,785
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1305
01:28:31,785 --> 01:28:33,887
SAM: And I'm going to look for secret compartments
in the wall.

1306
01:28:33,887 --> 01:28:35,537
LIAM: Investigation, you said?

1307
01:28:35,537 --> 01:28:40,444
MATT: For investigating these specific things for
this purpose, yes.

1308
01:28:40,444 --> 01:28:41,969
LIAM: All right, 20 for me.

1309
01:28:41,969 --> 01:28:43,671
SAM: 19 for me.

1310
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:47,852
LAURA: 23 for me.

1311
01:28:47,852 --> 01:28:59,462
MATT: Okay. Inspecting the room, you find-- the
chest that you're looking at currently, Vax, it

1312
01:28:59,462 --> 01:29:07,187
has scrapes on the inside that look like it
contained a great sum of money, that was then

1313
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:17,690
removed and taken, as if pretty much a large
portion of his personal wealth was removed. That's

1314
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,320
your inspection check.

1315
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,310
LIAM: Okay.

1316
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:32,103
MATT: You, looking about the room, Vex, you find
that the arrangement of the furniture seems to

1317
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:38,450
have these glyphs that are inscribed on certain
pieces of his furniture that are reminiscent of

1318
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,412
some of the glyphs that you saw--

1319
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:42,124
LAURA: In a teleportation circle?

1320
01:29:42,124 --> 01:29:48,944
MATT: No, actually, on the ziggurat. There are
symbols that are concurrent with some of the

1321
01:29:48,944 --> 01:29:54,127
writings that you saw inscribed up there. You
can't read it, necessarily, and they don't appear

1322
01:29:54,127 --> 01:29:58,550
to be enchanted by any means, at least not anymore,
but there is-- it appears like there was

1323
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:05,549
something about this room that was purposely
arranged for some sort of arcane purpose.

1324
01:30:05,549 --> 01:30:07,935
LIAM: What are you gasping about? You sound
perturbed.

1325
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:16,776
LAURA: Oh. The glyphs, I saw them at the ziggurat.
Keyleth, Pike, do you know anything about--

1326
01:30:16,776 --> 01:30:20,690
MATT: Anyone who wants to take a shot at arcane, I
would recommend those who are proficient, because

1327
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:22,728
it's pretty deep knowledge.

1328
01:30:22,728 --> 01:30:25,041
MARISHA: I can't do the arcane thing.

1329
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,581
SAM: I'll do an arcane check.

1330
01:30:26,581 --> 01:30:27,962
TRAVIS: Yep, me as well.

1331
01:30:27,962 --> 01:30:30,955
SAM: Grog is an expert on all things.

1332
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:32,648
LIAM: Natural 20, Grog.

1333
01:30:32,648 --> 01:30:34,514
ASHLEY: Oh! Natural 20!

1334
01:30:34,514 --> 01:30:41,272
TALIESIN: I wanna see how this pulls together.

1335
01:30:41,272 --> 01:30:47,034
TRAVIS: (confused laugh) I'm sorry.

1336
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:57,158
MATT: So. As you all sit around and pull forth
this chair, there's a broken piece of the--

1337
01:30:57,158 --> 01:31:04,084
(laughs) of the bed that was found as part of the
guards rummaging through the room. You also see

1338
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:08,162
that one of the floorboards that is pulled up has
this carved on the bottom element of it. And as

1339
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:11,853
you're looking it over, especially, specifically
Scanlan, who has seen many things about the world

1340
01:31:11,853 --> 01:31:13,411
as a bard, and taken in much knowledge.

1341
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:15,819
SAM: I'm very well-travelled and very old.

1342
01:31:15,819 --> 01:31:19,871
MATT: You're trying to find out what the
connection to this is. You've seen parts of this

1343
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:23,163
arrangement before, and while the runes are
different, there is something about the way

1344
01:31:23,163 --> 01:31:31,220
they're arranged that reminds you of something,
and Grog, you immediately remember that the last

1345
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:37,619
time that your party tried to scry into somewhere
that didn't want to be scryed in, and it was

1346
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:40,960
either aggressively ousted or prevented from any
sort of intrusion--

1347
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,201
TRAVIS: The beholder.

1348
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:46,248
MATT: It's the same type of arrangement in here.
Something about this just says, "This room doesn't

1349
01:31:46,248 --> 01:31:47,821
want you to look at it."

1350
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:55,877
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, it's funny, but like the
pictures that were on the big shape, right,

1351
01:31:55,877 --> 01:32:00,527
there's something about it that reminds me with
this arrangement of that time that we fought that

1352
01:32:00,527 --> 01:32:06,068
shit-head beholder. Yeah, like, it doesn't really
want us to look in it.

1353
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:10,757
LAURA: Is this like an anti-scrying glyph set?

1354
01:32:10,757 --> 01:32:14,309
MATT: Having a look at it now that you've been
given the guidance from Grog, the

1355
01:32:14,309 --> 01:32:16,542
all-arcane-seeing barbarian--

1356
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:19,797
SAM: His instincts are just right there.

1357
01:32:19,797 --> 01:32:21,611
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's just a feral thing, you know.

1358
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:27,058
MATT: He's very good at finding the memory. But
that helps guide you to the knowledge and

1359
01:32:27,058 --> 01:32:31,383
understanding, and immediately that is it. These
glyphs were, while no longer having power because

1360
01:32:31,383 --> 01:32:36,268
an element of them was taken or damaged in the
process, this room was guarded against scrying,

1361
01:32:36,268 --> 01:32:43,507
very subtly, but essentially preventing anyone
from peering into Riskel's private goings-on and

1362
01:32:43,507 --> 01:32:50,014
anything he was doing within his personal delvings
with the Briarwoods was all kept from being peered

1363
01:32:50,014 --> 01:32:50,846
into.

1364
01:32:50,846 --> 01:32:56,499
SAM: Do I know what kind of magic or what kind of
magic wielder would have been able to protect this

1365
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:58,496
room or design this protection?

1366
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:05,296
MATT: Pretty much any caster of a decent, mediocre
skill for casting can be done, and it's not a

1367
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:08,435
terribly uncommon enchantment, it's just
expensive.

1368
01:33:08,435 --> 01:33:16,153
MARISHA: Do we have any idea when the letters came
in to Emon that we were successful?

1369
01:33:16,153 --> 01:33:19,747
MATT: Which ones? You sent different ones at
different times.

1370
01:33:19,747 --> 01:33:23,651
MARISHA: Either or. When did they get them, do we
know? Can we find that information?

1371
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:27,580
MATT: The letter that you guys had sent that just
absolved you of your stuff that you had sealed,

1372
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:34,658
that was sent closer to Winter's Crest, and that
has not arrived yet. The one that you sent to

1373
01:33:34,658 --> 01:33:38,641
Allura, regarding the inspection of the
ziggurat--

1374
01:33:38,641 --> 01:33:39,661
MARISHA: Yes, that one.

1375
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:47,228
MATT: That arrived about a week and a half ago,
so-- that arrived a lot sooner because you sent it

1376
01:33:47,228 --> 01:33:54,674
a lot sooner, and Allura's already left, and
apparently has gone to seek some allies to help

1377
01:33:54,674 --> 01:33:55,470
her--

1378
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:57,447
MARISHA: And it's been about three days since
they've seen Riskel?

1379
01:33:57,447 --> 01:33:58,837
MATT: About three days, yeah.

1380
01:33:58,837 --> 01:34:01,269
SAM: And did we find anything else, any hidden
compartments or anything?

1381
01:34:01,269 --> 01:34:03,263
MATT: No hidden compartments throughout the room
throughout your search, no.

1382
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:04,725
MARISHA: Can I go outside?

1383
01:34:04,725 --> 01:34:07,174
MATT: Yeah. You step outside of the room.

1384
01:34:07,174 --> 01:34:11,326
MARISHA: I wanna do a-- no, outside. Dirt. I want
dirt under me.

1385
01:34:11,326 --> 01:34:16,308
MATT: Okay. You're gonna have to walk out on the
actual palace into the courtyard area that's

1386
01:34:16,308 --> 01:34:17,953
around the front.

1387
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:19,049
SAM: Okay, bye, Keyleth.

1388
01:34:19,049 --> 01:34:21,407
MARISHA: I'll be right back! I'll be right back,
I'm not gonna, I'll be right back.

1389
01:34:21,407 --> 01:34:26,236
SAM: I think she has to drop a D. With that
expression--

1390
01:34:26,236 --> 01:34:29,408
MARISHA: I just like the bushes better.

1391
01:34:29,408 --> 01:34:31,055
TRAVIS: Is there a guard outside of the room?

1392
01:34:31,055 --> 01:34:32,806
MATT: Yeah, there are two guards outside of the
room, and there are the two guards that have stood

1393
01:34:32,806 --> 01:34:34,755
back and let you guys go about your business.

1394
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:37,471
TRAVIS: Should we try and shake one down, and ask
who was the last person to see him?

1395
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,863
LAURA: Why do we need to shake him down, hey!

1396
01:34:39,863 --> 01:34:41,151
TRAVIS: Because it's what I do.

1397
01:34:41,151 --> 01:34:44,655
LAURA: Do you know the last time-- who the last
person was that saw this gentleman?

1398
01:34:44,655 --> 01:34:57,439
MATT: "As far as we know, last he was seen was a
few days ago. His servant, actually, who's

1399
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:00,611
"currently being interrogated, two rooms down, will
probably have more information."

1400
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,055
LAURA: What was the servant's name?

1401
01:35:02,055 --> 01:35:07,282
MATT: "This would be--" Hold on, let me pull this
up real fast.

1402
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:08,675
LAURA: The guard just keeps notes.

1403
01:35:08,675 --> 01:35:10,478
MATT: The guard goes through all of his notes
here.

1404
01:35:10,478 --> 01:35:15,718
LIAM: He's got two pieces of toilet paper with
charcoal on it.

1405
01:35:15,718 --> 01:35:19,759
MATT: "Jeffrey."

1406
01:35:19,759 --> 01:35:22,442
ALL: Jeffrey.

1407
01:35:22,442 --> 01:35:28,539
SAM: He's being interrogated right now?

1408
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:29,946
TRAVIS: I immediately leave the room.

1409
01:35:29,946 --> 01:35:31,357
SAM: Yeah, yeah, let's go do that.

1410
01:35:31,357 --> 01:35:32,994
TALIESIN: I follow Grog.

1411
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:39,640
MATT: All right. We'll get there before you get to
your place, so. As you're heading down through the

1412
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:45,170
palace. You guys go to the next room, and the
door's open, and you can see this young man,

1413
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:54,097
probably in his early 20s or so, half-elf, his
dark hair is pulled back into a very tight

1414
01:35:54,097 --> 01:36:00,343
ponytail-- go, you got it. He's sat in a chair,
currently, not tied up or anything, but there are

1415
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:07,748
two guards who are currently shouting at him and
currently one's like, "Where'd he go? Have you

1416
01:36:07,748 --> 01:36:15,089
"seen him? Where'd he go?" And he's, "I'm trying to
tell you, he just-- he left three days ago. He

1417
01:36:15,089 --> 01:36:18,981
"packed up and he left! He walked right out. He
said he--" And he looks over and sees you at the

1418
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:21,037
doorway. (whimpers)

1419
01:36:21,037 --> 01:36:24,051
TRAVIS: You two. Leave.

1420
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:27,539
MATT: The two guards immediately step away and
leave the room. Do you enter with him?

1421
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:28,952
SAM: I do.

1422
01:36:28,952 --> 01:36:30,526
LAURA: Good cop, bad cop?

1423
01:36:30,526 --> 01:36:32,257
MATT: All right, so all of you guys follow in
after Grog--

1424
01:36:32,257 --> 01:36:36,781
LIAM: Grog's the good cop. Look at his face.

1425
01:36:36,781 --> 01:36:44,013
TRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge. And I put it,
unsheathed, next to my foot.

1426
01:36:44,013 --> 01:36:49,542
MATT: As it slams into the wood, it sinks about an
inch, as the blade just slips into the wooden

1427
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:58,134
floor. And you can see, you guys, as he pulls it
out and sets it to his side, almost like mist off

1428
01:36:58,134 --> 01:37:09,035
of a very hot, wet surface. You can see shadow
just drifting off the blade ever so slightly.

1429
01:37:09,035 --> 01:37:16,796
TRAVIS: You know, there are those that protect
life, and they just left. Now, whatever me and my

1430
01:37:16,796 --> 01:37:22,657
mates are gonna ask, you're going to answer
honestly, or your life will be forfeit.

1431
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:26,334
MATT: "Right, um. I--"

1432
01:37:26,334 --> 01:37:31,716
TRAVIS: Don't talk unless you're asked a question.
My little mate over here will begin.

1433
01:37:31,716 --> 01:37:33,492
SAM: Jeffrey, is it?

1434
01:37:33,492 --> 01:37:34,976
MATT: "Aye."

1435
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,497
SAM: Jeffrey--

1436
01:37:36,497 --> 01:37:37,370
MATT: "Yeah?"

1437
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:39,085
SAM: He doesn't want to use the sword.

1438
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:40,656
MATT: "I don't want him to."

1439
01:37:40,656 --> 01:37:47,371
SAM: He doesn't like to use the sword. It's a lot
to clean, there's brains on it. He likes to keep

1440
01:37:47,371 --> 01:37:53,505
it nice and tidy in here. This isn't even our
palace. Don't make him use the sword.

1441
01:37:53,505 --> 01:37:55,960
MATT: "Oh no. I don't want him to."

1442
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:01,052
SAM: Just answer the questions. It's totally fine,
all right? It's going to be fine. Do you want some

1443
01:38:01,052 --> 01:38:02,064
water?

1444
01:38:02,064 --> 01:38:03,135
MATT: "No, no."

1445
01:38:03,135 --> 01:38:09,482
SAM: Pipe to smoke or anything? Just anything to
relax you, make you feel better.

1446
01:38:09,482 --> 01:38:12,078
MATT: "No, I'm okay."

1447
01:38:12,078 --> 01:38:14,070
TRAVIS: When was the last time you saw Riskel?

1448
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:23,395
MATT: "That would be three and a half days ago. He
took most of his belongings and packed them up for

1449
01:38:23,395 --> 01:38:27,314
"a trip. He said he'd be back within a month."

1450
01:38:27,314 --> 01:38:30,525
TRAVIS: Insight check that bitch.

1451
01:38:30,525 --> 01:38:35,386
SAM: All right. I will insight check him. That
bitch. That did not go well.

1452
01:38:35,386 --> 01:38:42,056
TRAVIS: I'll do it as well. 16?

1453
01:38:42,056 --> 01:38:52,084
MATT: He seems to be bewildered, fearful, and not
holding back any information. He's just at a point

1454
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:54,783
where he doesn't seem quite sure what else to
say.

1455
01:38:54,783 --> 01:39:02,272
SAM: Uh-oh, sorry, Jeffrey. He's not gonna like
using that sword, but it looks like it's coming.

1456
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,254
MATT: "Please don't. No, no, no, no no. No, no,
no. You don't have to--"

1457
01:39:04,254 --> 01:39:05,783
SAM: The sword is moving a little, isn't it?

1458
01:39:05,783 --> 01:39:07,694
TRAVIS: Spinning it. Spinning it now. On the tip.

1459
01:39:07,694 --> 01:39:13,449
MATT: "Three days he left, he said he'd be gone
for a month, I-I don't know where-- he left!

1460
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:16,073
"He-he-he walked right out of the Cloudtop
District."

1461
01:39:16,073 --> 01:39:18,235
TRAVIS: Where did he say he was gonna go?

1462
01:39:18,235 --> 01:39:20,291
MATT: "He didn't tell me. He didn't."

1463
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:27,121
SAM: Oh boy, this is gonna be a hard night for me,
I'm gonna have to talk him down from this, he gets

1464
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:28,502
so worked up--

1465
01:39:28,502 --> 01:39:31,081
TRAVIS: I just got it clean, I just got it clean.

1466
01:39:31,081 --> 01:39:32,380
MATT: "I don't know!"

1467
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:36,420
SAM: Jeffrey, please, you're just gonna make more
work for me if you-- if he has to behead you right

1468
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,435
now, please.

1469
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:40,866
MATT: "Don't behead me. I just met a girl, please
don't--"

1470
01:39:40,866 --> 01:39:45,502
TRAVIS: I mean I know the answers are inside you.
If I have to open you up to get to 'em I will.

1471
01:39:45,502 --> 01:39:47,461
MATT: "No, there's no answers to find! I'm empty!
I--"

1472
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:51,243
SAM: Jeffrey, Jeffrey, did your boss get any
letters that he stowed away anywhere, did he have

1473
01:39:51,243 --> 01:39:54,897
a safe-keeping place, a secret residence somewhere
in the city walls--

1474
01:39:54,897 --> 01:40:01,251
MATT: "He had a chest, but he took everything out,
he left. I don't know! I don't know!"

1475
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,630
SAM: Did he ever regularly travel to anywhere in
the walls of the city?

1476
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:09,023
MATT: "Uh-- he um--"

1477
01:40:09,023 --> 01:40:11,120
TRAVIS: I walk up and stand right next to him.

1478
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:16,924
MATT: "I um-- I-I-I-I escorted him once or twice
to the-- to the Graveyard District."

1479
01:40:16,924 --> 01:40:19,073
SAM: Where specifically?

1480
01:40:19,073 --> 01:40:24,144
MATT: "Uh, it was uh. It was a-a tavern-- it was
far, far beneath him. I found it curious that he

1481
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:25,566
"would attend."

1482
01:40:25,566 --> 01:40:27,006
SAM: The tavern's name?

1483
01:40:27,006 --> 01:40:28,434
MATT: "Uh, it was um..."

1484
01:40:28,434 --> 01:40:31,299
TRAVIS: I lay the sword right on the table and
look at the reflection.

1485
01:40:31,299 --> 01:40:36,349
MATT: "The Diamond Nest Tavern! That's the one!
The Diamond Nest Tavern! He went there, I assumed

1486
01:40:36,349 --> 01:40:43,671
"to do what young-ish elven men do when they're in
stuffy work. I don't know! I don't know, I didn't

1487
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:44,854
"go inside."

1488
01:40:44,854 --> 01:40:47,477
TALIESIN: How often did he go into the Diamond
Nest Tavern?

1489
01:40:47,477 --> 01:40:48,913
SAM: This is our sergeant.

1490
01:40:48,913 --> 01:40:53,186
MATT: "Not often! A few times every few months."

1491
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:58,778
TALIESIN: Did it follow some sort of regular
schedule or was it just out of the blue?

1492
01:40:58,778 --> 01:41:06,134
MATT: "No, not that I recall. He-- every six
months or so... uh, a few times recently, in the

1493
01:41:06,134 --> 01:41:07,980
"past month, but that was, that was all."

1494
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,620
TALIESIN: I feel this has been very helpful.

1495
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:15,780
SAM: Yes, yes, you have been quite helpful... Give
us the name of that girl so we can send our

1496
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,973
condolences to her?

1497
01:41:16,973 --> 01:41:21,663
MATT: "No no no no no! Please please please
don't--" He's just weeping now, openly, like

1498
01:41:21,663 --> 01:41:22,706
this--

1499
01:41:22,706 --> 01:41:25,015
TRAVIS: Oh, not on the blade, not on the blade...

1500
01:41:25,015 --> 01:41:28,544
MATT: You hear a voice in your head go, "No, keep the
tears coming."

1501
01:41:28,544 --> 01:41:29,837
TRAVIS: What?

1502
01:41:29,837 --> 01:41:34,530
TALIESIN: Grog, are you feeling all right?

1503
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:39,868
TRAVIS: What? Yeah. How are you?

1504
01:41:39,868 --> 01:41:44,184
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I just want to check in, to
see how you're doing.

1505
01:41:44,184 --> 01:41:47,332
LIAM: Percival, you seem a little pallid all of a
sudden. Are you feeling all right?

1506
01:41:47,332 --> 01:41:51,568
SAM: Jeffrey, is there anything else that might
help us in our search for your former employer?

1507
01:41:51,568 --> 01:41:56,275
MATT: (whimpering) "Don't kill me." He's lost at
this point.

1508
01:41:56,275 --> 01:41:57,937
LAURA: Lost. Okay...

1509
01:41:57,937 --> 01:42:00,042
TALIESIN: The sword is a bit iffy...

1510
01:42:00,042 --> 01:42:03,632
SAM: Grog, what do you think?

1511
01:42:03,632 --> 01:42:07,968
MATT: "End its torture. End its measly life."

1512
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:10,450
TRAVIS: Can you see in this room right now?

1513
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:12,769
MATT: "I can see everything you can see."

1514
01:42:12,769 --> 01:42:18,403
TRAVIS: What? I was saying, can you see in this
room right now. Can you see what's happening in

1515
01:42:18,403 --> 01:42:22,683
this room right now? We are totally intimidating
the shit out of-- Jeffrey?

1516
01:42:22,683 --> 01:42:24,899
MATT: (whimpering) "Yes!"

1517
01:42:24,899 --> 01:42:30,937
TRAVIS: Do you see what's happening in the--
(whispering loudly) Shut the fuck up!

1518
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:33,654
SAM: Grog, what do you think? Should we let him
live?

1519
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:42,194
TRAVIS: Well, I suppose. He's been pretty helpful.
(yelling) Haven't you, Jeffrey?! And I hold it

1520
01:42:42,194 --> 01:42:43,505
right under his chin.

1521
01:42:43,505 --> 01:42:44,951
(laughter)

1522
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:48,891
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom check.

1523
01:42:48,891 --> 01:42:51,503
LAURA: Oh my god! You're gonna kill him!

1524
01:42:51,503 --> 01:42:55,098
MATT: Oh I'm sorry, a wisdom saving throw.

1525
01:42:55,098 --> 01:42:57,183
ALL: Saving throw?!

1526
01:42:57,183 --> 01:42:59,315
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

1527
01:42:59,315 --> 01:43:01,423
LIAM: You're a terrible person.

1528
01:43:01,423 --> 01:43:02,834
TRAVIS: 14?

1529
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:12,408
MATT: 14! For a moment, the shadows begin to
surround you, and you feel the urge to push the

1530
01:43:12,408 --> 01:43:19,123
blade right through his measly little throat. But
you see the face. But it's not his face: it's the

1531
01:43:19,123 --> 01:43:22,972
face of Pike right next to you looking up at you
with this--

1532
01:43:22,972 --> 01:43:24,435
ASHLEY: Grog!

1533
01:43:24,435 --> 01:43:27,762
MATT: -- and you pull yourself out for a second,
and the blade comes back instinctively.

1534
01:43:27,762 --> 01:43:32,835
TRAVIS: What?! It was all part of the show.
Heh. It was a show. All right, Jeffrey, you've

1535
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:43,016
been very helpful. Change your britches, and don't
do bad stuff. And I sheath it.

1536
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:47,261
MATT: "Okay. I won't. Thank you! Thank you."

1537
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:53,177
SAM: Have a good day! And remember, shop at
Gilmore's Glorious Goods!

1538
01:43:53,177 --> 01:43:56,138
(laughter)

1539
01:43:56,138 --> 01:43:58,760
MATT: "Okay! I will! I will!"

1540
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,135
LAURA: Trinket goes up and licks his face.

1541
01:44:01,135 --> 01:44:02,516
MATT: (yelps)

1542
01:44:02,516 --> 01:44:07,216
TRAVIS: We should give him something. Ah, fuck
him.

1543
01:44:07,216 --> 01:44:11,811
MATT: As you guys all walk out of there, you hear
in the back of your head, Grog, this long,

1544
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:19,747
rumbling, deep, unhappy sigh.

1545
01:44:19,747 --> 01:44:26,686
LAURA: We should go check out this tavern, then.

1546
01:44:26,686 --> 01:44:28,896
SAM: Yes, we should. Maybe get a drink there?

1547
01:44:28,896 --> 01:44:31,764
LAURA: Yeah. And maybe go to the bathroom there.

1548
01:44:31,764 --> 01:44:36,871
MATT: All right. So you guys, you're heading to
the--

1549
01:44:36,871 --> 01:44:39,310
MARISHA: Well, I'm out in the courtyard.

1550
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,854
MATT: Yes. Now getting to Keyleth.

1551
01:44:40,854 --> 01:44:42,932
MARISHA: I want to do a Commune with Nature
spell.

1552
01:44:42,932 --> 01:44:45,258
MATT: All right! So.

1553
01:44:45,258 --> 01:44:53,642
ALL: (singing) The Age of Aquarius.

1554
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:55,340
MATT: That got weird.

1555
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,508
TALIESIN: This is what happens when you spend time
on your phone.

1556
01:44:57,508 --> 01:45:03,769
MATT: All right. Commune with Nature. So what are
you requesting to know about?

1557
01:45:03,769 --> 01:45:07,209
MARISHA: Is Riskel anywhere in town?

1558
01:45:07,209 --> 01:45:14,774
MATT: As you're connecting, you feel your mind
reach out to the earth itself, to all the plant

1559
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:20,204
life that exists beneath and through the cracks of
the cobblestones. The few trees that are peppered

1560
01:45:20,204 --> 01:45:27,034
throughout the city, keeping arduous watch over
the goings-on within the city of Emon, and a single

1561
01:45:27,034 --> 01:45:31,193
thought comes back to you that says, yes.

1562
01:45:31,193 --> 01:45:35,611
SAM: Oh, shit. I mean, I'm not there.

1563
01:45:35,611 --> 01:45:41,020
MARISHA: Can I take my second question to focus a
little harder and figure out where in town he is?

1564
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:46,646
LAURA: What a good idea. Good idea!

1565
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:47,956
MARISHA: Thanks!

1566
01:45:47,956 --> 01:45:58,351
MATT: Your vision casts through and brings towards
the outskirts of the Graveyard District. It brings

1567
01:45:58,351 --> 01:46:06,383
you to a series of buildings, one building in
particular, but not within, beneath. And the

1568
01:46:06,383 --> 01:46:07,683
vision fades.

1569
01:46:07,683 --> 01:46:09,436
LAURA: He's at the tavern, right? I mean.

1570
01:46:09,436 --> 01:46:11,089
TRAVIS: Or is he a fucking vampire?

1571
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:12,902
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

1572
01:46:12,902 --> 01:46:14,796
MARISHA: Vision fades? That's all I got?

1573
01:46:14,796 --> 01:46:17,129
MATT: Yeah. He's beneath the tavern. That
tavern--

1574
01:46:17,129 --> 01:46:18,433
MARISHA: So I get one more question?

1575
01:46:18,433 --> 01:46:19,721
MATT: You do.

1576
01:46:19,721 --> 01:46:21,516
SAM: How and when will I die?

1577
01:46:21,516 --> 01:46:23,453
MARISHA: (laughs) What is the meaning of life?

1578
01:46:23,453 --> 01:46:24,536
LAURA: 42.

1579
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:32,576
MARISHA: Can I see any type of underground secret
tunnels or passageways that lead out of the city?

1580
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,956
What?

1581
01:46:33,956 --> 01:46:46,677
MATT: You have a brief vision. There are a number
of tunnels that snake underneath the city, many of

1582
01:46:46,677 --> 01:46:55,980
which are long-collapsed or destroyed. You do know
there are a handful that spill out towards the

1583
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,180
docks, deep beneath the city itself.

1584
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,927
LAURA: Smugglers.

1585
01:47:01,927 --> 01:47:09,817
MATT: You're hard-pressed to find specific
locations, but one of them does seem to drift near

1586
01:47:09,817 --> 01:47:13,570
the location of the tavern you were previously
given a vision of.

1587
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:17,317
MARISHA: Okay. Cool beans.

1588
01:47:17,317 --> 01:47:22,501
MATT: Nature fades from your grasp, and suddenly
your consciousness returns to just your simple

1589
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:24,137
form of Keyleth.

1590
01:47:24,137 --> 01:47:27,402
SAM: Keyleth!

1591
01:47:27,402 --> 01:47:29,224
MARISHA: Ah! What!

1592
01:47:29,224 --> 01:47:33,263
SAM: Keyleth, we found a lot of information by
scaring an innocent boy. We need to go to the

1593
01:47:33,263 --> 01:47:35,388
Graveyard District for some reason.

1594
01:47:35,388 --> 01:47:36,472
LAURA: There's a tavern!

1595
01:47:36,472 --> 01:47:39,362
MARISHA: That's funny, I found the same thing, but
I just meditated for a minute.

1596
01:47:39,362 --> 01:47:40,345
SAM: Shit.

1597
01:47:40,345 --> 01:47:43,286
TALIESIN: That's not nearly as much fun.

1598
01:47:43,286 --> 01:47:46,934
MARISHA: You know, I'm glad we got things that
overlapped, though. That's good, I mean, it

1599
01:47:46,934 --> 01:47:53,944
corroborates, exactly. Cool. Well, I found good
news, Eskil, I mean, Riskel is still in town.

1600
01:47:53,944 --> 01:47:56,409
LAURA: Really? Are you sure?

1601
01:47:56,409 --> 01:48:05,481
MARISHA: I'm pretty sure. I got-- his essence was
floating in nature's ether, and nature told me he

1602
01:48:05,481 --> 01:48:06,432
was here.

1603
01:48:06,432 --> 01:48:07,638
LAURA: Where? At the tavern?

1604
01:48:07,638 --> 01:48:11,470
MARISHA: In the Graveyard District, it seems like
he's somewhere-- I saw that-- he's somewhere

1605
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:17,734
underground. Also, it looks like there is in fact
quite a lot of tunnels and secret passageways that

1606
01:48:17,734 --> 01:48:19,341
lead out of the city near there.

1607
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:21,205
SAM: You are amazing. Amazing.

1608
01:48:21,205 --> 01:48:28,847
LIAM: Pike and I spent a bit of time underground
in the Graveyard District with the Clasp, I don't

1609
01:48:28,847 --> 01:48:32,366
know if the Thieves' Guild is connected--

1610
01:48:32,366 --> 01:48:35,788
MATT: This tavern, the Diamond Nest Tavern was the
tavern that contained the secret entrance to the

1611
01:48:35,788 --> 01:48:36,754
Clasp.

1612
01:48:36,754 --> 01:48:38,646
LAURA: We busted in there!

1613
01:48:38,646 --> 01:48:40,461
MARISHA: So we have been, I thought it sounded
familiar.

1614
01:48:40,461 --> 01:48:41,779
LAURA: Oh, shit.

1615
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:43,926
MARISHA: Wait, was this the same tavern, is this
the one that's got, like--

1616
01:48:43,926 --> 01:48:45,251
TALIESIN: Burt Reynolds?

1617
01:48:45,251 --> 01:48:49,874
MARISHA: Right, is this the one that's
also like a whorehouse? Is that that one?

1618
01:48:49,874 --> 01:48:51,186
SAM: Aren't they all?

1619
01:48:51,186 --> 01:48:52,569
TRAVIS: We're definitely going.

1620
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:58,098
MATT: No, no, this one does not. You've only
really been to it at the really wee hours of

1621
01:48:58,098 --> 01:49:02,788
the morning when no one was there for the most
part so you could sneak in and out. You have not

1622
01:49:02,788 --> 01:49:04,990
been there during its normal operating business
hours.

1623
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,677
MARISHA: What time is it right now?

1624
01:49:06,677 --> 01:49:09,440
MATT: Right now, after all this conversation, I'd
say it's pushing one, two o'clock in the

1625
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,306
afternoon.

1626
01:49:10,306 --> 01:49:11,820
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go, plenty of time.

1627
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:17,813
LAURA: I think it's a perfect time to take a break
and then--

1628
01:49:17,813 --> 01:49:20,077
MATT: I was about to get to that. Actually.

1629
01:49:20,077 --> 01:49:21,145
TRAVIS: Somebody's about to bust.

1630
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:23,192
LAURA: Somebody needs to go to the bathroom.

1631
01:49:23,192 --> 01:49:26,684
MATT: Gotcha. Are you guys heading towards the
Graveyard District?

1632
01:49:26,684 --> 01:49:27,664
SAM: We're heading.

1633
01:49:27,664 --> 01:49:32,247
MATT: All right. As you gather up this
information, head out of the Cloudtop District

1634
01:49:32,247 --> 01:49:37,038
towards the western side of Emon, towards the
Graveyard District, we will go ahead and take a

1635
01:49:37,038 --> 01:49:39,342
quick break. We'll see you guys back here in a
little bit.

1636
01:49:39,342 --> 02:04:51,404
[break]

1637
02:04:51,571 --> 02:04:55,303
MATT: Welcome back, guys. We've had a little break
here, we're gonna go ahead and hop back into this

1638
02:04:55,303 --> 02:05:03,940
chaos. So. As the party, Vox Machina, makes their
way through Emon, the sun itself pushing towards

1639
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:10,114
about 2:30, three o'clock in the afternoon. You
make your way towards the Graveyard District, and

1640
02:05:10,322 --> 02:05:15,208
there to the familiar-- (laughs)

1641
02:05:15,208 --> 02:05:23,242
LIAM: Wait! On the way, can I throw something in
here? Halfway there I go: Argh! Oh my foot. Pike!

1642
02:05:23,242 --> 02:05:26,465
Come here! and I pull her off to the side. We'll
catch up, we'll catch up.

1643
02:05:26,465 --> 02:05:29,013
LAURA: What?! What's wrong with your stupid foot?

1644
02:05:29,013 --> 02:05:32,094
LIAM: I take the insults and I wait 'til they all
march on.

1645
02:05:32,094 --> 02:05:35,218
TRAVIS: (laughing) I take the insults!

1646
02:05:35,218 --> 02:05:38,550
ASHLEY: I take the insults, and I continue.

1647
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:46,835
LIAM: Used to it, used to it. Pike. I had a front
row seat to the Briarwoods, and that blade that

1648
02:05:46,835 --> 02:05:51,169
Grog has now that we have never seen before came
off of Sylas Briarwood.

1649
02:05:51,169 --> 02:05:54,407
ASHLEY: I thought something was wrong.

1650
02:05:54,407 --> 02:06:00,235
LIAM: It makes me nervous. I don't know why other
than it looks big and fucking scary. I thought

1651
02:06:00,235 --> 02:06:05,733
about talking to him myself but he will just kick
me in the goolies, so I thought that I would tell

1652
02:06:05,733 --> 02:06:10,162
you, because I think he would listen to you, he
certainly would--

1653
02:06:10,162 --> 02:06:11,945
ASHLEY: Did you see the stuff coming off the--

1654
02:06:11,945 --> 02:06:17,442
LIAM: Yeah, it kind of reminded me of Percival's
shit, which is why I'm talking to you now.

1655
02:06:17,442 --> 02:06:21,248
ASHLEY: Well, that makes me stressed.

1656
02:06:21,248 --> 02:06:25,125
LIAM: But he likes you! Not so much me.

1657
02:06:25,125 --> 02:06:31,633
ASHLEY: I'll talk to him, and see maybe if... I
don't know, I'm gonna check out the sword and see

1658
02:06:31,633 --> 02:06:33,047
if maybe--

1659
02:06:33,047 --> 02:06:35,627
LAURA: What's that sound? Is somebody popping
popcorn?!

1660
02:06:35,627 --> 02:06:39,184
MARISHA: Yeah, I think they are. I think they're
eating popcorn. I can hear it.

1661
02:06:39,184 --> 02:06:42,940
TRAVIS: There's a street vendor on the way to the
tavern that's, yep.

1662
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:51,104
LIAM: Anyway, that's it.

1663
02:06:51,104 --> 02:06:55,208
ASHLEY: Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Fist
bump.

1664
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:56,557
TRAVIS: (belches)

1665
02:06:56,557 --> 02:07:00,376
MATT: You hear Grog belch in the distance and it
echoes through the open walkway of the city's

1666
02:07:00,376 --> 02:07:07,724
streets. Yeah, it's pretty fantastic. You catch up
to the party, and you guys make your way to the

1667
02:07:07,724 --> 02:07:12,923
outside of the Diamond Nest Tavern, a familiar
tavern to all of you as you've been here once or

1668
02:07:12,923 --> 02:07:18,911
some of you twice before. However, during this
time, the front doors are open, in the middle of

1669
02:07:18,911 --> 02:07:25,696
the afternoon, and you can hear from the inside
the laughter, bustle and movement of people, and

1670
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:31,565
music playing very loudly from the interior, it
sounds like various instruments cross-playing and

1671
02:07:31,565 --> 02:07:36,125
the occasional cheer as glasses and steins clink
on the inside.

1672
02:07:36,125 --> 02:07:44,186
LIAM: I'm gonna throw up my hood, and I'm gonna
pull out my other cloak, the red one, and I'm

1673
02:07:44,186 --> 02:07:47,258
putting it over Pike, putting the hood over Pike's
head.

1674
02:07:47,258 --> 02:07:52,116
LAURA: You have two extra cloaks? You gave me one
and then you have another one?

1675
02:07:52,116 --> 02:07:53,964
TRAVIS: It's like Dumb and Dumber with the
gloves.

1676
02:07:53,964 --> 02:07:55,756
MATT: Which cloak are you giving her, then?

1677
02:07:55,756 --> 02:07:57,201
LIAM: Oh, the Mountebank.

1678
02:07:57,201 --> 02:07:59,457
MATT: Okay. And you're keeping which one?

1679
02:07:59,457 --> 02:08:06,016
LIAM: The displacer cloak I've been wearing. I
just don't want you to be seen.

1680
02:08:06,016 --> 02:08:07,748
ASHLEY: Am I invisible?

1681
02:08:07,748 --> 02:08:09,585
MATT: No. (laughter)

1682
02:08:09,585 --> 02:08:11,922
TRAVIS: Just say yes! Just say yes!

1683
02:08:11,922 --> 02:08:14,674
SAM: Where's Pike? Where did Pike go?

1684
02:08:14,674 --> 02:08:16,324
ASHLEY: Hey! Nobody can see me!

1685
02:08:16,324 --> 02:08:19,817
(clanking noises)

1686
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:26,629
MATT: Your features are better hidden by this
cloak, just because it's big and not currently

1687
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:28,823
designed for someone of your stature.

1688
02:08:28,823 --> 02:08:30,326
LIAM: You gotta pull it round your cheeks.

1689
02:08:30,326 --> 02:08:34,405
MARISHA: I was gonna say, what does the clientele
of the bar look like?

1690
02:08:34,405 --> 02:08:43,212
MATT: Well, as you guys step inside, the clientele
here appears to be regular; the equivalent of like

1691
02:08:43,212 --> 02:08:48,019
a blue-collar work staff, like, a lot of folks that
are you know, sleeves rolled up to the elbows,

1692
02:08:48,019 --> 02:08:54,919
dirt on the face, gentlemen who are part of
either construction crews, or stone workers,

1693
02:08:54,919 --> 02:09:03,548
masonry, probably work within the actual district
in the process of moving plots, or building, you

1694
02:09:03,548 --> 02:09:09,427
know, small mausoleums, things like that within
the actual confines of the district. You see

1695
02:09:09,427 --> 02:09:18,047
across the way there's a live band playing, of
which, you know, they're no one really of note at

1696
02:09:18,047 --> 02:09:23,893
first, however, Scanlan, you do recognize two of
the individuals on the far side of the bar. In the

1697
02:09:23,893 --> 02:09:34,072
band. There is an individual named Kent Plucker,
who is a halfling bard, currently on the lute,

1698
02:09:34,072 --> 02:09:43,306
which you had traveled with previously, for quite
some time along with the other individual you

1699
02:09:43,306 --> 02:09:50,220
recognize, a rowdy-looking but well-dressed
half-orc violinist named named Dr. Dranzel.

1700
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:53,538
(cheering)

1701
02:09:53,538 --> 02:10:01,147
MATT: A half-orc. Black hair slicked back,
well-dressed with a really rough-looking angry

1702
02:10:01,147 --> 02:10:06,274
chin. Aside from the attire and the dress would
look the meanest, and leaning more towards the orc

1703
02:10:06,274 --> 02:10:13,535
side than the human side, but very well-dressed,
with a violin over the chin that looks so tiny by

1704
02:10:13,535 --> 02:10:16,992
his massive frame, but he's playing away and it is
glorious.

1705
02:10:16,992 --> 02:10:19,691
LIAM: Have we heard of these individuals and
these--

1706
02:10:19,691 --> 02:10:27,681
MATT: You've heard whispers from Scanlan long ago
about just his travel, but you don't speak--

1707
02:10:27,681 --> 02:10:30,002
SAM: My troupe.

1708
02:10:30,002 --> 02:10:31,494
LIAM: Oh, I forgot about Dran.

1709
02:10:31,494 --> 02:10:36,284
TRAVIS: Oh! We forgot about Dre.

1710
02:10:36,284 --> 02:10:38,126
MARISHA: (laughing) Dr. Dre!

1711
02:10:38,126 --> 02:10:40,413
(laughter)

1712
02:10:40,413 --> 02:10:43,700
LIAM: 60 seconds late, ladies and gentlemen.

1713
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,526
SAM: It's my troupe.

1714
02:10:45,526 --> 02:10:47,590
ASHLEY: This is amazing.

1715
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:49,031
SAM: It's my troupe!

1716
02:10:49,031 --> 02:10:53,300
TRAVIS: Wanna go say hi?

1717
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:58,384
SAM: Of course I want to go say hi, but I don't
want to distract us from our mission.

1718
02:10:58,384 --> 02:11:00,598
LAURA: No no no, do your shit Scanlan, we'll just
look around.

1719
02:11:00,598 --> 02:11:04,207
ASHLEY: How about you ask to jump in for a tune?

1720
02:11:04,207 --> 02:11:08,890
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, we never get to see you
play, Scanlan, not to your full capacity!

1721
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:13,693
LIAM: I plant my foot firmly into his arse and
just shove him towards the two guys.

1722
02:11:13,693 --> 02:11:17,852
SAM: I haven't seen them for a while. I don't know
how they'll react to seeing me.

1723
02:11:17,852 --> 02:11:22,520
MATT: As you're getting that word out, you're
shoved forward, stumbling, almost being tripped by

1724
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:27,415
a few of the patrons, but as you stop and look up,
you see before you a young, cute gnomish girl with

1725
02:11:27,415 --> 02:11:34,028
very short pixie-brown hair, currently playing the
flute. She looks over at you and gives you a winky

1726
02:11:34,028 --> 02:11:40,126
grin. To the right of her you see a rather rotund
human male, with a bushy blond beard and raggedy

1727
02:11:40,126 --> 02:11:45,843
hair who currently has a series of small
percussion drums around him and just hitting

1728
02:11:45,843 --> 02:11:53,325
around, and to the other side of the small gnome
girl you see a half-elven, more mature woman, in

1729
02:11:53,325 --> 02:12:00,970
the later years for a half-elven woman, hair tied
into a very, very tight bun, and she is in the

1730
02:12:00,970 --> 02:12:07,221
process of singing this wondrous tune that matches
this improvisational feel of the band. Currently

1731
02:12:07,221 --> 02:12:13,939
Kent is not paying attention and is on the far
right side, but behind them all, towering over,

1732
02:12:13,939 --> 02:12:18,447
just by stature, is Dr. Dranzel with his violin,
and as you stumble forward he looks over and just

1733
02:12:18,447 --> 02:12:21,694
gives you a smile and keeps playing.

1734
02:12:21,694 --> 02:12:25,521
(laughter)

1735
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:27,910
SAM: Mind if I jump in?

1736
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:36,369
MATT: "It would be an honor! Scanlan Shorthalt,
ladies and gentlemen! Jump into the fray!"

1737
02:12:36,369 --> 02:12:43,413
SAM: Feast your eyes, feast your ears, on quite
a traveling troupe of musicians, and one humble

1738
02:12:43,413 --> 02:12:51,520
gnome who is so lucky and humbled to join them.
Please, keep the tips flowing for us, and your

1739
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,026
waitresses!

1740
02:12:53,026 --> 02:12:59,184
MATT: And with that, the current song comes to a
close, they all lift their instruments expectantly

1741
02:12:59,184 --> 02:13:00,921
and look towards you.

1742
02:13:00,921 --> 02:13:07,216
SAM: Let's play our old standard. And a oney and a
twoey and a oney and a twoey.

1743
02:13:07,216 --> 02:13:09,719
MATT: What instrument do you pull out?

1744
02:13:09,719 --> 02:13:11,441
LIAM: Vuvuzela.

1745
02:13:11,441 --> 02:13:20,256
SAM: I'm gonna pull out the flute, the flute, I'm
gonna play the flute for a while. 'Cause I don't

1746
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:23,647
wanna, the singer sounds good, I don't wanna rain
on her parade.

1747
02:13:23,647 --> 02:13:27,669
MATT: Yeah, no worries. So you pull out your flute
and other gnomish girl with her flute as well

1748
02:13:27,669 --> 02:13:32,279
gives you a look, and you guys start weaving
together this flute duel, almost like Flight

1749
02:13:32,279 --> 02:13:36,576
of the Bumblebees but two conflicting sides-- Go
ahead and make a perform check if you could.

1750
02:13:36,576 --> 02:13:44,088
SAM: I've never done one of these before.
Something tells me it might not go well.

1751
02:13:44,088 --> 02:13:45,847
TRAVIS: It's gonna be great!

1752
02:13:45,847 --> 02:13:50,531
MARISHA: I go and I get as many ales as I can
carry and start handing them to those guys.

1753
02:13:50,531 --> 02:13:51,997
MATT: Okay. No worries.

1754
02:13:51,997 --> 02:13:53,028
SAM: 22.

1755
02:13:53,028 --> 02:14:01,655
MATT: As you guys begin to build this perpetual
symphony of-- it's almost jazz flute almost in

1756
02:14:01,655 --> 02:14:03,323
this improvisational feel to it.

1757
02:14:03,323 --> 02:14:08,956
SAM: (flute noises)

1758
02:14:08,956 --> 02:14:14,625
MATT: The drums build, you can see Dr. Dranzel is
tapping his foot to it and he gets this really

1759
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:20,629
fast fiddle sound out of a classic violin, the
whole room begins to gather around and cheer.

1760
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:23,239
Vex.

1761
02:14:23,239 --> 02:14:28,512
MARISHA: Here, have a drink. Yeah!

1762
02:14:28,512 --> 02:14:30,900
LIAM: Another whisper. Two whispers!

1763
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:32,371
SAM: Jesus.

1764
02:14:32,371 --> 02:14:34,327
(laughter)

1765
02:14:34,327 --> 02:14:39,965
SAM: Ashley is subtly massaging Laura's ass.

1766
02:14:39,965 --> 02:14:41,839
ASHLEY: For inspiration.

1767
02:14:41,839 --> 02:14:50,300
LAURA: I keep an eye on him and make sure he
doesn't-- any of us.

1768
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:54,845
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. All right, so. As the song
builds, builds, builds, people are cheering and

1769
02:14:54,845 --> 02:14:57,703
shouting, and you bring the drinks over, Keyleth,
and you set them down.

1770
02:14:57,703 --> 02:15:04,061
SAM: Can me and the other flutist end with an
impossibly long held note?

1771
02:15:04,061 --> 02:15:11,450
MATT: Make another perform check.

1772
02:15:11,450 --> 02:15:13,533
SAM: 33.

1773
02:15:13,824 --> 02:15:24,170
MATT: And with that, you both inhale, almost like
through eye contact you knew it was coming. Hold,

1774
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:29,252
and hold, and you can see her eyes start to get
tense and bloodshot, her face starts turning beet

1775
02:15:29,252 --> 02:15:33,518
red, all the rest of the music stops and everyone
just gathers around, the air leaves the room as

1776
02:15:33,518 --> 02:15:43,166
everyone seems to lean in, and eventually she
gives up and exhales and inhales sharply, dizzied

1777
02:15:43,166 --> 02:15:49,185
by it but still smiling and you can only imagine
the blurred romantic tunnel vision she has in your

1778
02:15:49,185 --> 02:15:55,453
direction, as you carry it for about three seconds
more and then end with a trill at the end. The

1779
02:15:55,453 --> 02:16:03,677
whole room just rouses in cheers and clapping,
you can now see coppers and silvers and a few gold

1780
02:16:03,677 --> 02:16:07,428
are being thrown onto the floor in front of you,
there's a small bucket at the base of the small

1781
02:16:07,428 --> 02:16:13,354
stage platform and Dr. Dranzel then stands up,
takes his hat off of the ground next to him, and

1782
02:16:13,354 --> 02:16:18,514
bows, as the rest of the group bows before as
well. You know the drill, you've done this for

1783
02:16:18,514 --> 02:16:23,104
quite some time. Everyone cheers, a few more
drinks, even though you bought rounds for

1784
02:16:23,104 --> 02:16:27,959
everyone, other people are buying rounds and
bringing it up. And it's been a while since you've

1785
02:16:27,959 --> 02:16:31,887
done a performance of this magnitude, and it makes
you feel good, and at that point you feel a hand

1786
02:16:31,887 --> 02:16:38,286
clasp your shoulder and Dr. Dranzel leans in,
"It's good to see you again, Shorthalt. It's been

1787
02:16:38,286 --> 02:16:39,158
"a while."

1788
02:16:39,158 --> 02:16:40,844
SAM: Yes it has, sir, yes it has.

1789
02:16:40,844 --> 02:16:42,767
MATT: "Haven't lost your edge."

1790
02:16:42,767 --> 02:16:48,203
SAM: I'm a little rusty, but I trust you'll keep
me honest through this.

1791
02:16:48,203 --> 02:16:56,662
MATT: "Honest? We've always been honest. Come!
Drink. Eat with us." And they all put their

1792
02:16:56,662 --> 02:17:03,333
instruments up, as he says: "We've just finished
our set. Let's catch up. It's been some time, I'd

1793
02:17:03,333 --> 02:17:05,901
"like to hear of your journeys and tell you of some
of ours."

1794
02:17:05,901 --> 02:17:08,557
SAM: Absolutely. I'll be back in a while,
fellows.

1795
02:17:08,557 --> 02:17:09,931
ASHLEY: Good job, Scanlan!

1796
02:17:09,931 --> 02:17:11,722
MATT: "Oh are these, are these your friends?"

1797
02:17:11,722 --> 02:17:14,010
SAM: Oh yes, these are my traveling companions
and--

1798
02:17:14,010 --> 02:17:20,181
TRAVIS: I'm his bodyguard. He's very popular.

1799
02:17:20,181 --> 02:17:22,890
MATT: "You can afford a bodyguard of that
magnitude?"

1800
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:27,029
SAM: Oh, I've done quite well, thanks to your
tutelage.

1801
02:17:27,029 --> 02:17:30,956
MATT: "Well great, great, well, come on, you don't
all need to stay away! Have your friends

1802
02:17:30,956 --> 02:17:31,943
"sit with us."

1803
02:17:31,943 --> 02:17:32,659
SAM: They can join us?

1804
02:17:32,659 --> 02:17:37,589
MATT: "Certainly!" He goes and calls over, he
goes, "Kaylie, Zed, help me with the tables." And

1805
02:17:37,589 --> 02:17:44,037
the gnome and the rotund bearded human rush off
and start grabbing a couple of the tables and they

1806
02:17:44,037 --> 02:17:48,831
cram them in the corner, so now you basically have
built this monopoly on the far corner of the

1807
02:17:48,831 --> 02:17:51,631
tavern now, where all of you guys can sit around
and cluster.

1808
02:17:51,631 --> 02:17:59,584
SAM: Kaylie, that was some fine playing. I might
have a tip or two about breath control.

1809
02:17:59,584 --> 02:18:07,013
MATT: "Sorry, not all of us are quite as old and
seasoned as the others."

1810
02:18:07,013 --> 02:18:09,072
(jeering and laughter)

1811
02:18:09,072 --> 02:18:19,150
SAM: Well, I've learned quite a thing or two in my
years and, it might interest you to take a little

1812
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:22,119
private tutoring session sometime.

1813
02:18:22,119 --> 02:18:26,036
MATT: "Scanlan Shorthalt. You know, I've heard
quite a bit about you."

1814
02:18:26,036 --> 02:18:29,752
SAM: My legend is spread far and wide, I'm sure.

1815
02:18:29,752 --> 02:18:34,834
MATT: "Indeed. And I know better than most ladies
that may cross your path."

1816
02:18:34,834 --> 02:18:37,011
SAM: You may change your "tune."

1817
02:18:37,011 --> 02:18:40,937
(noncommittal groans)

1818
02:18:40,937 --> 02:18:44,376
SAM: Grog, a little help over here.

1819
02:18:44,376 --> 02:18:47,973
LIAM: You had us, and then you lost us.

1820
02:18:47,973 --> 02:18:52,410
ASHLEY: Can I give him inspiration? Somehow?

1821
02:18:52,410 --> 02:18:54,156
MATT: How?

1822
02:18:54,156 --> 02:18:55,579
ASHLEY: I don't know.

1823
02:18:55,579 --> 02:18:59,462
MATT: What would you like to do to make Scanlan
look better in this circumstance?

1824
02:18:59,462 --> 02:19:01,879
TALIESIN: Perhaps help him with his pitch.

1825
02:19:01,879 --> 02:19:03,182
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1826
02:19:03,182 --> 02:19:11,402
SAM: It's lovely to meet you anyway.

1827
02:19:11,402 --> 02:19:14,074
LIAM: Vex once helped Grog in a very specific
way.

1828
02:19:14,074 --> 02:19:25,655
ASHLEY: I will-- the man, the myth, and the
legend, is true. So, in case you wanted to find out--

1829
02:19:25,655 --> 02:19:28,633
(laughter)

1830
02:19:28,633 --> 02:19:34,103
MATT: She gives you a look over, looks over at
Scanlan.

1831
02:19:34,103 --> 02:19:41,130
SAM: Yeah. Yeah that, we're close, we're tight,
she and I and-- she's come back for more.

1832
02:19:41,130 --> 02:19:43,251
MATT "A holy woman?"

1833
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:45,852
MARISHA: Oh shit!

1834
02:19:45,852 --> 02:19:47,837
SAM: She's got holes in all the right places.

1835
02:19:47,837 --> 02:19:50,663
(groaning)

1836
02:19:50,663 --> 02:19:52,317
SAM: I don't know what I'm doing here!

1837
02:19:52,317 --> 02:20:01,300
MATT: She actually at that point goes (laughs),
turns around, "Doctor! You weren't kidding. This

1838
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:07,592
"one's certainly a card." And she gives you a wink,
and passes a drink your way across the table. As

1839
02:20:07,592 --> 02:20:11,639
the crowd simmers down, people go back about their
business, and the drinks are brought to the table

1840
02:20:11,639 --> 02:20:15,943
and scattered about, the rest of you find your
seats, and sitting around, they gather up the coin

1841
02:20:15,943 --> 02:20:23,292
that was taken, and Kent, who sits down next to
Dr. Dranzel, looks over and says: "Ah, it's been a

1842
02:20:23,292 --> 02:20:27,484
"while, Scanlan. I'm glad to see you. Glad you
could join us. It was like old times. It was nice."

1843
02:20:27,484 --> 02:20:31,245
SAM: "It was nice. What have you fellows been
doing for these years?"

1844
02:20:31,245 --> 02:20:37,428
MATT: "Well, we just finished up coming out here
and playing for Winter's Crest. We made a good

1845
02:20:37,428 --> 02:20:40,432
"deal of money, we're on our way out and figured
we'd finish up a few of these gigs." And Dr.

1846
02:20:40,432 --> 02:20:46,883
Dranzel kicks in and says, "Emon, these days,
seems to be doing all right. Paid us well for our

1847
02:20:46,883 --> 02:20:51,362
"time here and, well, you've earned a little coin
yourself from this." And he takes a little handful

1848
02:20:51,362 --> 02:20:57,728
of coins from the pile they had amassed and chucks
it over your way. It's like 25 gold.

1849
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:03,919
SAM: Oh, well, thank you, but I can't possibly
accept this.

1850
02:21:03,919 --> 02:21:06,316
MATT: "Fair enough!" And he scoops it back.

1851
02:21:06,316 --> 02:21:08,405
(laughter)

1852
02:21:08,405 --> 02:21:11,623
SAM: You deserve it. It's your gig, you booked it.
I'm just playing here for the night.

1853
02:21:11,623 --> 02:21:12,945
MATT: "Ah, you're fine."

1854
02:21:12,945 --> 02:21:21,412
At this point, you guys notice a small halfling
boy, definitely not an adult, probably in his late

1855
02:21:21,412 --> 02:21:29,230
teens, comes up to the edge of the table, you
know, big eyes and softer features, and he's

1856
02:21:29,230 --> 02:21:35,421
dressed a little inconspicuously, comes up.
"Doctor. Good performance, good performance." and

1857
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:40,171
he claps and looks about the rest of the table.
And Doctor's like, "It's fine, boy,

1858
02:21:40,171 --> 02:21:46,065
"they're friends." At which point the boy nods,
looks about the rest of you, lifts up a small

1859
02:21:46,065 --> 02:21:50,403
satchel and unloads it on the table next to Dr.
Dranzel, and you see spill out a much larger

1860
02:21:50,403 --> 02:22:00,330
collection of coppers, silver, rings, bits of
jewelry, a few loose coin purses, and Dr. Dranzel

1861
02:22:00,330 --> 02:22:04,097
reaches over and pats him on the head. "Good boy,
Samson, good boy."

1862
02:22:04,097 --> 02:22:05,640
LAURA: Nice haul, Samson.

1863
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:10,637
MATT: "Thanks," and he looks about awkwardly and
expectantly and---

1864
02:22:10,637 --> 02:22:13,972
SAM: Still up to the old tricks, I see, Doctor.

1865
02:22:13,972 --> 02:22:19,850
MATT: "Hey, when business is good, Scanlan, when
business is good." And he reaches over and grabs a

1866
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:25,428
small bit of the gold coin and puts it into
Samson's hands and goes, "Go buy yourself some toys,"

1867
02:22:25,428 --> 02:22:31,610
and pats him on the back, and the boy runs off
excitedly. He quickly looks about and takes a

1868
02:22:31,610 --> 02:22:35,052
bunch of the gold and scoops it into a small
satchel at his side and hands it off to Kaylie.

1869
02:22:35,052 --> 02:22:40,168
Kaylie takes it. Kaylie, who at this point has
been introduced as the gnomish girl who you saw

1870
02:22:40,168 --> 02:22:44,508
her grabbing the table. She takes the satchel and
whisks her hand for a moment and the satchel just

1871
02:22:44,508 --> 02:22:48,475
vanishes in her grasp in a little puff of smoke.

1872
02:22:48,475 --> 02:22:50,645
SAM: I like this girl.

1873
02:22:50,645 --> 02:22:59,720
MATT: "Huh. So the company you're keeping seems to
be formidable."

1874
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:02,845
LAURA: We are.

1875
02:23:02,845 --> 02:23:04,814
MATT: "What can we call you?"

1876
02:23:04,814 --> 02:23:07,425
SAM: We call ourselves Vox Machina.

1877
02:23:07,505 --> 02:23:09,246
MATT: "Sounds really formal."

1878
02:23:09,246 --> 02:23:11,073
LAURA: (laughs) You can call us The S.H.I.T.s.

1879
02:23:11,073 --> 02:23:12,454
MATT: "I like that much better!"

1880
02:23:12,454 --> 02:23:13,878
(laughter)

1881
02:23:13,878 --> 02:23:25,016
"That's the Scanlan I know. Shits it is. So,
Shits, what do you do? What's your trade? What are

1882
02:23:25,016 --> 02:23:29,161
"you tugging around with this sorry sap for?"

1883
02:23:29,161 --> 02:23:35,333
SAM: They're powerful warriors, killers,
assassins, magic wielders. Not quite as ornery as

1884
02:23:35,333 --> 02:23:42,416
a bunch as musicians, but still pretty amazing
people. We've had quite a few adventures the past few

1885
02:23:42,416 --> 02:23:43,329
years.

1886
02:23:43,329 --> 02:23:44,840
LAURA: Scanlan's a kingslayer.

1887
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:46,352
MARISHA: It's true.

1888
02:23:46,352 --> 02:23:50,688
SAM: He might not believe you or really anything
about me.

1889
02:23:50,688 --> 02:23:53,397
LIAM: You doubt the cube?

1890
02:23:53,397 --> 02:24:00,335
MATT: There aren't a lot of kings in these lands.

1891
02:24:00,335 --> 02:24:02,339
SAM: But there's one fewer now.

1892
02:24:02,470 --> 02:24:12,326
MATT: (laughs) "All right, Kingslayer. So I take
it you're all experienced in a little skullduggery

1893
02:24:12,326 --> 02:24:13,916
"from time to time, yes?"

1894
02:24:13,916 --> 02:24:16,494
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1895
02:24:16,494 --> 02:24:18,208
TALIESIN: Grog, it doesn't mean what you think it
means.

1896
02:24:18,208 --> 02:24:19,506
TRAVIS: Oh.

1897
02:24:19,506 --> 02:24:40,351
MATT: "We're thinking of shoving off. We recently
got a tip, if you're interested. Word came about

1898
02:24:40,351 --> 02:24:44,621
"about a dickhead with too much change in his
basement---"

1899
02:24:44,621 --> 02:24:47,118
LAURA: (laughs) Are you leaning on something,
Doctor?

1900
02:24:47,118 --> 02:24:50,407
MATT: Yes. I'm leaning on the back of a chair that
I see in my imagination. (shouts) It's my window!

1901
02:24:50,407 --> 02:24:51,241
Go with it!

1902
02:24:51,241 --> 02:24:52,804
ASHLEY: I got it, I got it, I got it!

1903
02:24:52,804 --> 02:24:53,912
(laughter)

1904
02:24:53,912 --> 02:24:55,264
LIAM: There's a very short man, right there.

1905
02:24:55,264 --> 02:24:57,366
TALIESIN: He's in a cast. He's been playing with a
cast the entire time.

1906
02:24:57,423 --> 02:25:02,348
MATT: Towards the back of the tavern, there's a
small wooden thing. He's lounging, he's a casual

1907
02:25:02,348 --> 02:25:03,873
guy, the Doctor.

1908
02:25:03,873 --> 02:25:05,530
LIAM: His name is Jonathon.

1909
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:07,657
MATT: No. It is Doctor Dranzel.

1910
02:25:07,657 --> 02:25:11,242
SAM: Please, Vex, a little respect, he's a
physician.

1911
02:25:11,242 --> 02:25:13,414
(laughter)

1912
02:25:13,414 --> 02:25:16,666
MATT: "Anyway."

1913
02:25:16,666 --> 02:25:19,419
SAM: A tip about a dickhead.

1914
02:25:19,419 --> 02:25:25,879
MATT: "Word came about a dickhead who has too much
change in his basement. It's weighing down his

1915
02:25:25,879 --> 02:25:33,768
"personality. You wanna help this poor old withered
man alleviate this burden?"

1916
02:25:33,768 --> 02:25:36,644
SAM: You mean steal from him?

1917
02:25:36,644 --> 02:25:42,743
MATT: "No! I mean, help it go to good hard-working
folk who deserve it more."

1918
02:25:42,743 --> 02:25:44,575
SAM: What kind of a dickhead is he?

1919
02:25:44,575 --> 02:25:49,502
MATT: "I haven't dealt with him personally. People
have told me he's a bit of a thorn in the side of,

1920
02:25:49,502 --> 02:25:53,791
"well, any lively folk. Especially those of an
artistic persuasion."

1921
02:25:53,791 --> 02:25:55,318
MARISHA: What's his name?

1922
02:25:55,318 --> 02:26:05,503
MATT: "Don't know the name. But I know where he
lives. We've looked at the place, cased it if you

1923
02:26:05,503 --> 02:26:13,983
"will. There could be a few ways in. Unfortunately,
we've become a little higher profile during our

1924
02:26:13,983 --> 02:26:20,909
"stay here than we expected and I don't know if we're
quite as skilled in the realm of shadow-walking."

1925
02:26:20,909 --> 02:26:27,458
LAURA: Doctor, we're quite skilled but we have a
bit of a name for ourselves as well. I'm afraid we

1926
02:26:27,458 --> 02:26:29,416
may not be able to help you out.

1927
02:26:29,416 --> 02:26:30,350
MATT: "Right, very well."

1928
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:32,003
TALIESIN: We're quite the opposite of low
profile.

1929
02:26:32,003 --> 02:26:34,992
MATT: "Well, not to worry. Figured I'd pass it
your way."

1930
02:26:34,992 --> 02:26:38,988
SAM: If we were to pursue it, what would your take
be?

1931
02:26:38,988 --> 02:26:46,576
MATT: "Well, based on a finder's fee, and based on
the relationship we've had all these years, our

1932
02:26:46,576 --> 02:26:49,243
"troupe would be happy to take a 40% cut."

1933
02:26:49,243 --> 02:26:54,685
SAM: And this is a vast sum of money we might
find?

1934
02:26:54,685 --> 02:27:00,154
MATT: "From what I've heard, sizeable enough for
me to want to include someone the likes of you.

1935
02:27:00,154 --> 02:27:05,450
"You know I don't like to include outsiders so
regularly."

1936
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:13,464
SAM: Well, I'm not quite an outsider. Yes, them.
Well, we could investigate, if you give us an

1937
02:27:13,464 --> 02:27:15,887
address or description.

1938
02:27:15,887 --> 02:27:18,395
MATT: "All right, all right."

1939
02:27:18,395 --> 02:27:22,168
LIAM: I haven't been paying close attention, but
who is this mark?

1940
02:27:22,168 --> 02:27:24,009
LAURA: He didn't say his name.

1941
02:27:24,009 --> 02:27:28,749
LIAM: Don't know his name, he's just a dickhead.
That's all you know?

1942
02:27:28,749 --> 02:27:30,690
LAURA: What district does he live in?

1943
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:34,648
TRAVIS: No, no, no. The old man wants to
redistribute his wealth and we would be the vessel

1944
02:27:34,648 --> 02:27:36,444
by which he would do that.

1945
02:27:36,444 --> 02:27:45,149
MATT: "You've got a smart bodyguard on your hands,
too! (laughs) What's your name?"

1946
02:27:45,149 --> 02:27:46,914
TRAVIS: Grog.

1947
02:27:46,914 --> 02:27:50,365
MATT: "That's a good name. Yeah. Speaks of
intelligence."

1948
02:27:50,365 --> 02:27:51,940
MARISHA: Insight check?

1949
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:52,997
MATT: Sure.

1950
02:27:52,997 --> 02:27:56,652
MARISHA: 29.

1951
02:27:56,652 --> 02:27:59,565
LAURA: Wow, that's a good insight check.

1952
02:27:59,565 --> 02:28:01,098
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

1953
02:28:01,098 --> 02:28:03,022
LAURA: Secrets, secrets.

1954
02:28:03,022 --> 02:28:04,898
MARISHA: I get secrets!

1955
02:28:04,898 --> 02:28:22,722
SAM: Pike, thank you for being my wingman back
there.

1956
02:28:22,722 --> 02:28:28,645
ASHLEY: You're welcome, but how come you never
told us about Dr. Dranzel? Did you forget about him?

1957
02:28:28,645 --> 02:28:29,955
SAM: I told you--

1958
02:28:29,955 --> 02:28:32,721
ASHLEY: Did you forget about Dr. Dranzel?

1959
02:28:32,721 --> 02:28:42,786
TRAVIS: You forgot about Dranzel. Those
motherfuckers act like they forgot about

1960
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:43,908
Dranzel.

1961
02:28:43,908 --> 02:28:46,045
(laughter)

1962
02:28:46,045 --> 02:28:47,622
TALIESIN: This is my favorite thing ever.

1963
02:28:47,622 --> 02:28:48,757
MATT: "But no worries."

1964
02:28:48,757 --> 02:28:56,761
MARISHA: So you're just, out of the good of your
heart, wanting to redistribute a little bit of

1965
02:28:56,761 --> 02:29:02,591
funds to help out a few less fortunate people,
that's all you have in this?

1966
02:29:02,591 --> 02:29:04,169
MATT: "Yeah!"

1967
02:29:04,169 --> 02:29:05,296
MARISHA: Really?

1968
02:29:05,296 --> 02:29:12,170
MATT: "We're all rather less fortunate than this
dickhead, and I don't see why a little off his

1969
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:15,149
"table wouldn't even be noticed, probably."

1970
02:29:15,149 --> 02:29:20,393
MARISHA: And where exactly did you find this
information? On this dickhead?

1971
02:29:20,393 --> 02:29:22,201
TRAVIS: I think he said he asked him.

1972
02:29:22,201 --> 02:29:25,294
MARISHA: You asked him? What?

1973
02:29:25,294 --> 02:29:27,526
TRAVIS: No, no the old man asked him: oh, I need
to redistribute.

1974
02:29:27,526 --> 02:29:33,687
MATT: I have my reasons, my connections, my
friends here, and I've been told that his estate

1975
02:29:33,687 --> 02:29:35,887
has been abandoned for some time, actually.

1976
02:29:35,887 --> 02:29:45,242
SAM: Keyleth, this is an old friend of mine, who I
trust very much. He saved me when I was troubled

1977
02:29:45,242 --> 02:29:52,157
and taught me much about the ways of performing
and charming. He has my full trust.

1978
02:29:52,157 --> 02:29:56,643
MARISHA: Well, if I know anything about your
skills, Scanlan, I think it says a lot about Dr.

1979
02:29:56,643 --> 02:29:58,303
Dranzel. So--

1980
02:29:58,303 --> 02:29:59,750
SAM: I'll take that as a compliment.

1981
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:02,093
MARISHA: You're welcome. Forgive me if I'm--

1982
02:30:02,093 --> 02:30:07,567
TALIESIN: I think we obviously-- any friend of
Scanlan is a friend of ours and I think if Dr.

1983
02:30:07,567 --> 02:30:09,507
Dranzel here-- may I call you Dr. Dranzel?

1984
02:30:09,507 --> 02:30:11,021
MATT: "You may."

1985
02:30:11,021 --> 02:30:13,834
ASHLEY: Can I call you Dr. Dra?

1986
02:30:13,834 --> 02:30:17,699
TALIESIN: That has a really nice ring to it.

1987
02:30:17,699 --> 02:30:21,634
MATT: "Sounds to me unfinished and rather sloppy.
Just Doctor is fine."

1988
02:30:21,634 --> 02:30:23,054
ASHLEY: All right. Sorry.

1989
02:30:23,054 --> 02:30:24,522
TALIESIN: Professor Dranzel.

1990
02:30:24,522 --> 02:30:26,061
MATT: "Yes? Doctor. Doctor."

1991
02:30:26,061 --> 02:30:34,147
TALIESIN: Dr. Dranzel, and I want to know if
you're really a doctor later, but I think,

1992
02:30:34,147 --> 02:30:39,124
perhaps, maybe there's a little tidbit of
information about this that you're holding back

1993
02:30:39,124 --> 02:30:47,510
with because-- I would understand. We're new. We
don't really know each other. We're not really on

1994
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:54,577
that friendship level yet, but my point is, we
could be friends like that. We could be-- I'm

1995
02:30:54,577 --> 02:30:56,418
trying to see if this works.

1996
02:30:56,418 --> 02:30:59,198
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1997
02:30:59,198 --> 02:31:03,637
TALIESIN: You know what I'm doing. I'm attempting
Friends.

1998
02:31:03,637 --> 02:31:04,981
MATT: Oh, interesting.

1999
02:31:04,981 --> 02:31:06,118
TALIESIN: I'm attempting.

2000
02:31:06,118 --> 02:31:12,689
MATT: Okay, okay. Good to know this. All right,
then. What saving throw does he get for that one?

2001
02:31:12,689 --> 02:31:14,969
TALIESIN: I get advantage on charisma rolls.

2002
02:31:14,969 --> 02:31:23,034
MATT: Oh, right, right. Okay, okay. Yep, go for
it.

2003
02:31:23,034 --> 02:31:25,456
TALIESIN: Am I just rolling charisma?

2004
02:31:25,456 --> 02:31:27,634
MATT: You're rolling a persuasion with advantage.

2005
02:31:27,634 --> 02:31:36,706
TALIESIN: Oh, persuasion roll with advantage. Oh,
that's nice. 23.

2006
02:31:36,706 --> 02:31:47,289
MATT: Okay. He looks to you and goes, "We don't
know who it is. We've been told it's in the

2007
02:31:47,289 --> 02:31:52,970
"Cloudtop District. It's a red brick building. It's
been abandoned for over a year and apparently it's

2008
02:31:52,970 --> 02:31:58,055
"been well boarded up. But from what I've been
told, quite a lot of wealth is down there. But

2009
02:31:58,055 --> 02:32:05,765
"it's a bit dangerous of an entry. We have no way
of getting into the Cloudtop, but these myths keep

2010
02:32:05,765 --> 02:32:07,053
"finding our ears."

2011
02:32:07,053 --> 02:32:12,771
TALIESIN: If it's the house that I think it is,
it's already been--

2012
02:32:12,771 --> 02:32:14,292
LAURA: Pillaged?

2013
02:32:14,292 --> 02:32:21,766
TALIESIN: Pillaged. Pillaged is a good word. The
rumors were not incorrect but--

2014
02:32:21,766 --> 02:32:23,653
SAM: What house is this?

2015
02:32:23,653 --> 02:32:30,414
TALIESIN: Do you remember with the agon-day with
our utler-bay?

2016
02:32:30,414 --> 02:32:33,194
SAM: I don't speak Latin.

2017
02:32:33,194 --> 02:32:36,906
LAURA: Pretty sure it's already been cleaned out.

2018
02:32:36,906 --> 02:32:39,355
MATT: "That's unfortunate."

2019
02:32:39,355 --> 02:32:44,405
LAURA: Unless you're hearing things we don't know
about.

2020
02:32:44,405 --> 02:32:52,189
MATT: "I know that a few individuals have tried to
make their way in. Came out with hefty sums of

2021
02:32:52,189 --> 02:32:55,578
"gold but seemed to be a bit spooked."

2022
02:32:55,578 --> 02:33:01,887
LIAM: I'm gonna pull up a chair and sit down in
front of him. Hi, there. My name's Greg. Greg.

2023
02:33:01,887 --> 02:33:04,355
Yeah, I'm Scanlan's friend, Craig.

2024
02:33:04,355 --> 02:33:05,761
MATT: "Hello, Greg. All right, Craig."

2025
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:09,571
LIAM: Scanlan might be able to help you with this.
I'll definitely be able to help you with this, but

2026
02:33:09,571 --> 02:33:13,442
I'm not going to do anything unless I know
something more, so if you want to go into the

2027
02:33:13,442 --> 02:33:17,757
house, if you want me to break us into the house,
which I can certainly do, I really need to know a

2028
02:33:17,757 --> 02:33:22,801
little bit more. Your chances of getting whatever
you're after inside raise if you're honest with

2029
02:33:22,801 --> 02:33:28,849
me. And I don't feel yet like you're being honest
with me, so I want to help you, but I don't think

2030
02:33:28,849 --> 02:33:34,897
I can and without me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
we're not getting in the house, so is there

2031
02:33:34,897 --> 02:33:37,151
anything else you wanna tell me about--?

2032
02:33:37,151 --> 02:33:47,153
MATT: "That's all I know. All I know is they've
had a few other of the thieving persuasion have

2033
02:33:47,153 --> 02:33:51,816
"made their way in before and they came out with a
decent chunk of change, given that they could only

2034
02:33:51,816 --> 02:33:53,909
"be in there for a short time."

2035
02:33:53,909 --> 02:34:00,183
LIAM: I'm gonna insight check. That is a 19.

2036
02:34:00,183 --> 02:34:06,745
MATT: He's hard to read, but the best you can tell
is he's been pretty clear with you. And at this

2037
02:34:06,745 --> 02:34:10,513
point as you're looking at him, his eyes go--

2038
02:34:10,513 --> 02:34:15,857
TALIESIN: And this is the point where I buy you a
beer. And I put the coin down.

2039
02:34:15,857 --> 02:34:25,097
MATT: (laughs) "You're a tricky one. All right,
you've got yourself some talented compadres."

2040
02:34:25,097 --> 02:34:28,311
SAM: Well, they can't play as well as you, but
they're pretty good.

2041
02:34:28,311 --> 02:34:38,398
MATT: He takes the coin. Takes the drink. "Well,
you know where it is. You know what it looks like.

2042
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:42,563
"If you're interested in finding your way in and
come out with anything, we'll be here about

2043
02:34:42,563 --> 02:34:43,802
"another week."

2044
02:34:43,802 --> 02:34:45,896
LAURA: All right. How long have you been here?

2045
02:34:45,896 --> 02:34:49,440
MATT: "Probably been here about two weeks now. Two and
a half weeks."

2046
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:55,858
LAURA: Hmm. Have you noticed-- I'm sure you've
seen many people come in and out, but an older

2047
02:34:55,858 --> 02:35:00,347
gentleman dressed much nicer than he should be in
an establishment like this?

2048
02:35:00,347 --> 02:35:09,635
MATT: You describe Riskel to him? 
Riskel's elven. Thin features, older. Has some

2049
02:35:09,635 --> 02:35:15,255
battle scars, but long-ish hair kept behind his
ears. And as you describe it, he goes,

2050
02:35:15,255 --> 02:35:22,667
"Yes, yes actually. We had a gentleman like that
who came in here a couple of times about a week

2051
02:35:22,667 --> 02:35:24,892
"ago, and last saw a few days ago."

2052
02:35:24,892 --> 02:35:25,964
LAURA: A few days ago?

2053
02:35:25,964 --> 02:35:28,786
MATT: "Yeah! He came in and watched one of our
performances. Tipped us rather well!" (chuckles)

2054
02:35:28,786 --> 02:35:30,059
LAURA: Did he?

2055
02:35:30,059 --> 02:35:31,909
MATT: "Seemed a bit hurried."

2056
02:35:31,909 --> 02:35:34,039
LAURA: Yes. Did you see where he went?

2057
02:35:34,039 --> 02:35:37,300
MATT: "No, I assumed he was staying here at the
tavern."

2058
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:40,954
LAURA: Really? Are there rooms here?

2059
02:35:40,954 --> 02:35:43,255
MATT: "Yeah. Just upstairs, they have rooms
here."

2060
02:35:43,255 --> 02:35:45,628
TALIESIN: You should see if there's rooms
downstairs.

2061
02:35:45,628 --> 02:35:48,574
LAURA: Yeah. I get up and leave the table and go
talk to the barkeep.

2062
02:35:48,574 --> 02:35:53,104
SAM: Do you guys want us to create some sort of
distraction while you go search the place?

2063
02:35:53,104 --> 02:35:56,600
LAURA: I'm going to talk to the barkeep and talk
about rooms, potentially, first.

2064
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:57,999
SAM: For us?

2065
02:35:57,999 --> 02:36:01,667
LAURA: Just seeing what they have available, and
what's being rented right now.

2066
02:36:01,667 --> 02:36:03,271
SAM: Because we know he's downstairs.

2067
02:36:03,271 --> 02:36:10,294
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going to say, he was going to
go downstairs. I'll go with Team Downstairs.

2068
02:36:10,294 --> 02:36:13,257
TALIESIN: Team Downstairs it is.

2069
02:36:13,257 --> 02:36:14,526
ASHLEY: Team Downstairs.

2070
02:36:14,526 --> 02:36:23,267
MATT: As you head to the barkeep, you see a
dwarven woman wearing a simple blouse, but pulled

2071
02:36:23,267 --> 02:36:28,243
up past the elbows. She's currently wiping down
part of the front-- you can see her hair is pulled

2072
02:36:28,243 --> 02:36:34,118
up to a ponytail that drifts past her shoulders
down to the center of her chest. She glances up to

2073
02:36:34,118 --> 02:36:37,032
you as you approach. "Hi, so what can I get you,
dear?"

2074
02:36:37,032 --> 02:36:40,892
LAURA: Hi. You have rooms, yes?

2075
02:36:40,892 --> 02:36:48,705
MATT: "We have rooms, aye. We only got one currently
not occupied."

2076
02:36:48,705 --> 02:36:53,105
LAURA: Do you have an older gentleman? Elven,
battle scars-- I describe him-- staying here right now?

2077
02:36:53,105 --> 02:36:59,048
MATT: "No? No, I haven't seen someone like that."

2078
02:36:59,048 --> 02:37:00,353
LAURA: Insight-check her?

2079
02:37:00,353 --> 02:37:01,997
MATT: Make an insight check.

2080
02:37:01,997 --> 02:37:06,799
LAURA: That's okay. 23?

2081
02:37:06,799 --> 02:37:19,958
MATT: 23? Her demeanor has changed, and she has
gotten guarded. "Nope, haven't seen anyone like

2082
02:37:19,958 --> 02:37:24,020
"that here. Sorry! No. A lot of patrons coming
through."

2083
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:27,553
LAURA: Yeah. So many people come in and out. It
would be so easy to lose sight of somebody like

2084
02:37:27,553 --> 02:37:40,604
that who came in. I put five gold pieces onto the
countertop. It sure would be wonderful if you

2085
02:37:40,604 --> 02:37:44,245
could remember anything about him being here,
however.

2086
02:37:44,245 --> 02:37:51,026
MATT: She takes her cloth that she's wiping the
counter with, and wipes over and pushes the gold

2087
02:37:51,026 --> 02:37:55,957
coins towards you. Pulls back and goes, "Sorry,
dear. I can't help you."

2088
02:37:55,957 --> 02:38:01,902
LIAM: I walk up by my sister, and where the woman
just wiped that away, I take a piece of chalk out

2089
02:38:01,902 --> 02:38:09,768
of my pocket and write thieves' cant-- not the
word "thieves' cant"-- I use the thieves' cant on

2090
02:38:09,768 --> 02:38:22,010
the bar and say, in that language: there is a
threat here. I can help you deal with it. And

2091
02:38:22,010 --> 02:38:23,579
that's it.

2092
02:38:23,579 --> 02:38:25,721
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2093
02:38:25,721 --> 02:38:31,298
LIAM: Persuasion, you said? 20.

2094
02:38:31,298 --> 02:38:37,550
MATT: She looks at it. Looks at you. Still holding
her cloth, wipes it clean from the bar pretty

2095
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:52,732
quickly. (quietly) "You one of them? Kitchen
storage room. Under the rice and grain barrels."

2096
02:38:52,732 --> 02:38:57,458
(louder) "Sorry! Can't help you. That's
unfortunate."

2097
02:38:57,458 --> 02:39:00,305
LAURA: Completely understandable. Thank you for
your time!

2098
02:39:00,305 --> 02:39:02,608
MATT: "Of course, of course."

2099
02:39:02,608 --> 02:39:05,061
LIAM: We need to have a talk.

2100
02:39:05,061 --> 02:39:07,165
TALIESIN: Let's all meet.

2101
02:39:07,165 --> 02:39:12,772
LAURA: Scanlan, could you have your wonderful
friends create a distraction?

2102
02:39:12,772 --> 02:39:15,908
SAM: I can help them create one.

2103
02:39:15,908 --> 02:39:19,273
LAURA: Just enough so we can slip unnoticed
downstairs.

2104
02:39:19,273 --> 02:39:28,167
TRAVIS: Hold on. He's downstairs. Underground. Do
we think maybe he's a--

2105
02:39:28,167 --> 02:39:34,749
TALIESIN: No, because that would be very
complicated to deal with while still being part of

2106
02:39:34,749 --> 02:39:37,058
the political infrastructure of the city here.

2107
02:39:37,058 --> 02:39:38,362
LIAM: We need to talk.

2108
02:39:38,362 --> 02:39:42,154
MATT: You actually have seen him outside at
various events for the council. He was publicly

2109
02:39:42,154 --> 02:39:47,941
around for-- especially during your guys' intro--
when you were first given entry to the council.

2110
02:39:47,941 --> 02:39:50,013
You've seen Riskel around in daylight.

2111
02:39:50,013 --> 02:39:51,925
TRAVIS: I bet you one gold he's a vampire.

2112
02:39:51,925 --> 02:39:54,608
(laughter)

2113
02:39:54,608 --> 02:39:55,544
TALIESIN: Done!

2114
02:39:55,544 --> 02:40:00,055
LIAM: Yes, Grog, it's true. He's a vampire. Could
we please meet in a booth in the corner of the

2115
02:40:00,055 --> 02:40:02,036
pub, please? We need to talk now.

2116
02:40:02,036 --> 02:40:03,512
LAURA: All right.

2117
02:40:03,512 --> 02:40:08,545
TALIESIN: Excuse us, lovely fellows, we have prior
business. We'll be talking again very soon.

2118
02:40:08,545 --> 02:40:11,822
MATT: "Certainly hope so."

2119
02:40:11,839 --> 02:40:18,555
LIAM: I can't be 100% sure, but we are sitting
atop the thieves' guild. Pike and I have been

2120
02:40:18,555 --> 02:40:19,547
here before--

2121
02:40:19,547 --> 02:40:22,499
LAURA: We've been here. We've barged in here
before.

2122
02:40:22,499 --> 02:40:29,202
LIAM: Not down in the heart of it like we have.
Underneath here is a honeycomb of thieves.

2123
02:40:29,202 --> 02:40:32,047
TRAVIS: (gasps excitedly) Honeycomb! Oh, of
thieves.

2124
02:40:32,047 --> 02:40:41,457
LIAM: I think our man is downstairs. They've given
me the way in. But it's not going to be easy, it's

2125
02:40:41,457 --> 02:40:45,336
not just an empty basement. We're sitting on top
of the thieves' guild. This is the Clasp!

2126
02:40:45,336 --> 02:40:50,534
LAURA: Well, why do we have to-- why is it
dangerous? Why can't we just go in and ask for him

2127
02:40:50,534 --> 02:40:51,503
and get him?

2128
02:40:51,503 --> 02:40:53,152
TRAVIS: Aren't you part of them?

2129
02:40:53,152 --> 02:40:58,952
LIAM: I can-- Yes. I should take point. I'm just
saying we're not going down into an empty grain

2130
02:40:58,952 --> 02:41:00,853
cellar to kill a bunch of rats.

2131
02:41:00,853 --> 02:41:05,486
MARISHA: So do we think that the Clasp is
protecting Riskel? Is that what we're assuming?

2132
02:41:05,486 --> 02:41:09,414
LIAM: It's possible. For money, anything is
possible.

2133
02:41:09,414 --> 02:41:12,753
SAM: Well good to know, but we're still going.

2134
02:41:12,753 --> 02:41:19,356
MARISHA: I mean, you were with these people. Once.
What--

2135
02:41:19,356 --> 02:41:21,759
LAURA: Aren't you still-- I look at your hand--
don't you have the mark?

2136
02:41:21,759 --> 02:41:25,313
LIAM: It's complicated. Where did she say to go?
It was through the kitchen?

2137
02:41:25,313 --> 02:41:30,889
MATT: She said through the kitchen storage room,
on the left. And the mark is actually at the

2138
02:41:30,889 --> 02:41:32,509
middle of his--

2139
02:41:32,509 --> 02:41:34,174
LAURA: I mean, that's what I mean. I've seen it.

2140
02:41:34,174 --> 02:41:36,410
LIAM: Your memory is like an iron trap!

2141
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:39,857
SAM: I think you guys should go. Right away.

2142
02:41:39,857 --> 02:41:41,540
LAURA: You guys? Where are you?

2143
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:43,307
SAM: I'll follow close behind.

2144
02:41:43,307 --> 02:41:47,488
LIAM: We're going to go into the kitchen. We're
going to go two minutes apart, all right? Don't

2145
02:41:47,488 --> 02:41:51,720
all go in a crowd. I'm going to go in first. I'll
see you in there. And then I walk--

2146
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:58,069
SAM: I walk over to Kaylie. And I say: my dear
Kaylie, I'm sorry if we got off on a weird foot. I

2147
02:41:58,069 --> 02:42:01,763
have that effect on people sometimes,
especially--

2148
02:42:01,763 --> 02:42:04,506
MATT: "Your feet are weird? That's interesting."

2149
02:42:04,506 --> 02:42:08,407
SAM: (chuckles) Especially lovely-to-look-at
young ladies.

2150
02:42:08,407 --> 02:42:10,717
MATT: "Smaller than I expected, those feet!"

2151
02:42:10,717 --> 02:42:13,987
SAM: Well, you know what they say. Wait, no.
Don't.

2152
02:42:13,987 --> 02:42:15,477
MATT: "I know what they say."

2153
02:42:15,477 --> 02:42:20,454
SAM: Don't, no. Don't. That's not what-- Anyway.
(clears throat) I was impressed with you up there.

2154
02:42:20,454 --> 02:42:27,686
Your skills with the flute are remarkable. I was
wondering if I could have a little fun tonight and

2155
02:42:27,686 --> 02:42:37,210
challenge you to a flute-off! We go up on stage,
we ask the audience for suggestions, and we see

2156
02:42:37,210 --> 02:42:40,564
who can last the longest and blow the hardest.

2157
02:42:40,564 --> 02:42:43,308
(laughter)

2158
02:42:43,308 --> 02:42:51,413
SAM: If you win, I'll give you whatever's in my
purse. And if I win, I get a kiss.

2159
02:42:51,413 --> 02:42:53,973
MATT: "Somehow I think I'm still getting the shit
end of the deal."

2160
02:42:53,973 --> 02:42:57,249
(laughter and applause)

2161
02:42:57,249 --> 02:43:04,240
MATT: "But I'm one for fun at the very least. It's
a deal." (spits loudly)

2162
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:05,937
SAM: No, don't worry.

2163
02:43:05,937 --> 02:43:07,585
(laughter)

2164
02:43:07,585 --> 02:43:11,406
MATT: You guys shake on it. Are you waiting until
sundown, or are you doing it now--

2165
02:43:11,406 --> 02:43:14,178
SAM: No, we're going-- Oh, are we waiting until
sundown? Is that what's happening?

2166
02:43:14,178 --> 02:43:16,006
LIAM: I'm in the kitchen.

2167
02:43:16,006 --> 02:43:23,505
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! The
first ever flaute-off? Flutist-off? Flute duel!

2168
02:43:23,505 --> 02:43:28,356
Featuring me! Scanlan Shorthalt! And you,
Kaylie...?

2169
02:43:28,356 --> 02:43:29,778
MATT: "Kaylie's fine."

2170
02:43:29,778 --> 02:43:31,922
SAM: Kaylie's Fine, everyone!

2171
02:43:31,922 --> 02:43:33,760
(laughter)

2172
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:38,618
MATT: Some of the folks around are like-- some
seem disinterested by it, and some clap.

2173
02:43:38,618 --> 02:43:40,913
SAM: All eyes up here! It'll be a great show!

2174
02:43:40,913 --> 02:43:46,490
MATT: At this point, Dr. Dranzel is like: "Hah!
Well, this will be interesting!" And he's still

2175
02:43:46,490 --> 02:43:49,726
sitting back, watching. You guys are going in
first, you said?

2176
02:43:49,726 --> 02:43:52,490
LIAM: No, I already went in.

2177
02:43:52,490 --> 02:43:53,980
MATT: Stealth check.

2178
02:43:53,980 --> 02:44:01,111
LIAM: (quietly) She told me to go in! So that's a
23.

2179
02:44:01,111 --> 02:44:06,927
MATT: Okay. You seem to slip in. And there are two
individuals currently running the kitchen. There's

2180
02:44:06,927 --> 02:44:09,463
the smell of food, but there are no meals
currently being cooked. They're just talking to

2181
02:44:09,463 --> 02:44:11,774
each other. They don't even notice you slip by.

2182
02:44:11,774 --> 02:44:15,942
LAURA: I put my hood up before I head back that
way.

2183
02:44:15,942 --> 02:44:17,727
MATT: Go for it. Make a stealth check?

2184
02:44:17,727 --> 02:44:19,415
LAURA: (quietly) Oh no.

2185
02:44:19,415 --> 02:44:21,776
ASHLEY: I follow them! No, just kidding.

2186
02:44:21,776 --> 02:44:27,507
LAURA: Oh, I get advantage. Yeah! 25.

2187
02:44:27,507 --> 02:44:31,961
MATT: 25? Same thing. You guys turn around to the
left of the kitchen. There is a small stairway

2188
02:44:31,961 --> 02:44:37,084
that goes down about five feet into the storage
room, where you find your brother. And this is all

2189
02:44:37,084 --> 02:44:40,555
very familiar to you. You've been here once
before. This is where you guys exited the guild on

2190
02:44:40,555 --> 02:44:45,959
the way out, a long time ago. And there are a
series of crates and stuff. But in the far back

2191
02:44:45,959 --> 02:44:50,471
corner, there are two sacks that are labeled
"rice" and "grain", that are leaned up against

2192
02:44:50,471 --> 02:44:55,518
each other. So we'll get to you guys in just a
moment. Who is next up after you guys?

2193
02:44:55,518 --> 02:45:01,305
SAM: After they go, I call back to the kitchen and
I say: to choose the first song will be the lovely

2194
02:45:01,305 --> 02:45:05,345
gentlemen who have prepared our food for the
evening! Please come out here and choose a song

2195
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:06,618
for us!

2196
02:45:06,618 --> 02:45:11,647
MATT: Everyone looks over and one gentleman stands
up and--yells out into the kitchen--is like: "Hey!

2197
02:45:11,652 --> 02:45:21,940
"You're picking the song, mates!" Then you see two
folks come out. One's an older woman, wrinkled

2198
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:26,156
face, hair's a bit tattered, but she seems happy
and smiling amongst her-- happy lines are all

2199
02:45:26,156 --> 02:45:31,853
throughout her face. The other one's a younger
guy. Probably, looking at the features, related to

2200
02:45:31,853 --> 02:45:36,653
her, who's helping her out in the kitchen. And
they both step out, confounded. "What's going on?"

2201
02:45:36,653 --> 02:45:38,273
"Well yes, what's going on?"

2202
02:45:38,273 --> 02:45:42,114
SAM: Just pick us a song, any song! Everyone, give
a round of applause to your cooks for the

2203
02:45:42,114 --> 02:45:43,069
evening!

2204
02:45:43,069 --> 02:45:45,923
TALIESIN: I grab Keyleth and we slip behind them
and into the kitchen.

2205
02:45:45,923 --> 02:45:48,514
MATT: All right. Stealth checks from both of you
guys.

2206
02:45:48,514 --> 02:45:54,297
MARISHA: 15.

2207
02:45:54,297 --> 02:45:55,441
TALIESIN: 14.

2208
02:45:55,441 --> 02:46:02,577
MATT: Okay! The distraction was helpful! So you
guys slip past, seemingly unnoticed. Everyone's

2209
02:46:02,577 --> 02:46:09,026
attention is on them, currently. And they both
look at each other, and she goes, "I, um. Could

2210
02:46:09,026 --> 02:46:14,479
"you-- Flute, you say?" Takes some popcorn from her
pouch.

2211
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:18,366
SAM: Sure. Oh, yeah, she's-- Weird place to put
popcorn.

2212
02:46:18,366 --> 02:46:30,889
MATT: "It's a busy kitchen! Could you sing Clouds
Upon the Horizon? That was my favorite as a girl!"

2213
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:33,247
SAM: Ah! It's a ballad, but okay. Sure.

2214
02:46:33,247 --> 02:46:35,738
(laughter)

2215
02:46:35,738 --> 02:46:42,532
LIAM: Do you have an earring on? Scanlan, I need
you to make an ode to the kitchen staff. Could you

2216
02:46:42,532 --> 02:46:44,473
call the kitchen staff out and--

2217
02:46:44,473 --> 02:46:46,103
SAM: I did already! I did already!

2218
02:46:46,103 --> 02:46:47,489
LAURA: You called the kitchen staff out?

2219
02:46:47,489 --> 02:46:49,524
SAM: Yes! They're the ones who are suggesting the
song!

2220
02:46:49,524 --> 02:46:53,026
LIAM: Oh, really? We've just been in-- in the
back-- in that downstairs room where we didn't

2221
02:46:53,026 --> 02:46:56,108
know!? Well, we're in a separate room!

2222
02:46:56,108 --> 02:46:58,573
MATT: Yep! There you go! (chuckles)

2223
02:46:58,573 --> 02:47:00,381
SAM: Good thought! I had the same one!

2224
02:47:00,381 --> 02:47:03,474
LIAM: Everybody else: come now, come now, come
now.

2225
02:47:03,474 --> 02:47:08,946
MATT: All right, so you guys head down. Make 
stealth checks for both of you. That's going to be

2226
02:47:08,946 --> 02:47:11,001
disadvantage on you, Pike.

2227
02:47:11,001 --> 02:47:13,207
LAURA: Oh, and... Trinket.

2228
02:47:13,207 --> 02:47:15,044
MATT: Coming down with you?

2229
02:47:15,044 --> 02:47:16,748
SAM: A bear!?

2230
02:47:16,748 --> 02:47:22,516
LIAM: Really? Every tool has its place.

2231
02:47:22,516 --> 02:47:23,637
ASHLEY: Nine.

2232
02:47:23,637 --> 02:47:25,051
SAM: Nine?!

2233
02:47:25,051 --> 02:47:29,128
ASHLEY: Come on! What else is it gonna be with a
disadvantage?

2234
02:47:29,128 --> 02:47:30,448
TRAVIS: 13?

2235
02:47:30,448 --> 02:47:32,032
LAURA: 16.

2236
02:47:32,032 --> 02:47:36,600
MATT: After the-- You're really bringing Trinket
down there with you?

2237
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:38,183
LAURA: Is that bad? What else--

2238
02:47:38,183 --> 02:47:39,733
SAM: (yelling) Yes, it's bad!

2239
02:47:39,733 --> 02:47:41,852
(laughter)

2240
02:47:41,852 --> 02:47:47,142
MATT: As you all are waiting, you guys start
heading around. And as you're scooting around the

2241
02:47:47,142 --> 02:47:52,546
kitchen staff, Trinket, who is currently out
front, sees everyone scooting around and

2242
02:47:52,546 --> 02:47:58,375
disappearing into the back. Leaning his head into
the tavern, goes, (bear grunt) and begins walking

2243
02:47:58,375 --> 02:48:02,493
into the tavern. Other patrons start like
(startled exclamations), then like, "Bear! Bear,

2244
02:48:02,493 --> 02:48:07,688
"bear!" And other individuals start standing up and
seeing this bear come lumbering through the

2245
02:48:07,688 --> 02:48:08,816
tavern, towards the kitchen.

2246
02:48:08,816 --> 02:48:16,047
LAURA: Oh, shit. I hear it. I come out of the
kitchen very sneakily. Oh! Oh, my bear! I've been

2247
02:48:16,047 --> 02:48:19,075
looking everywhere for you. Trinket!

2248
02:48:19,075 --> 02:48:20,744
LIAM: Story of my life.

2249
02:48:20,744 --> 02:48:31,036
LAURA: What are you doing in this tavern! Oh,
dear! We should probably head outside! You and me,

2250
02:48:31,036 --> 02:48:32,046
Trinket!

2251
02:48:32,046 --> 02:48:34,591
LIAM: You've got two minutes.

2252
02:48:34,591 --> 02:48:41,735
LAURA: Fuck. I tell him-- Oh! Oh no, that's so
sad! But I tell him to head back to the keep, I

2253
02:48:41,735 --> 02:48:42,679
guess.

2254
02:48:42,679 --> 02:48:44,050
TRAVIS: To the keep, or just outside?

2255
02:48:44,050 --> 02:48:47,385
LAURA: To the keep! 'Cause what else? He can't
just hang out without us there!

2256
02:48:47,385 --> 02:48:49,180
ASHLEY: Maybe he could stay out there.

2257
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:51,296
LAURA: Really?

2258
02:48:51,296 --> 02:48:55,693
LIAM: While she's doing this bullshit, I'm going
to make sure that the rice bags and everything are

2259
02:48:55,693 --> 02:48:58,628
not trapped. Is there a clear stairways down, or?

2260
02:48:58,628 --> 02:49:03,462
MATT: The bags. You go to lift them, expecting
them to be very heavy. They're actually filled

2261
02:49:03,462 --> 02:49:05,941
with something much lighter. They're false-filled,
and they actually move out of the way very

2262
02:49:05,941 --> 02:49:09,811
quickly. And there is this similar hatch that
you guys have come through before. It's about five by

2263
02:49:09,811 --> 02:49:10,940
five foot wide.

2264
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:12,404
LIAM: I check for traps. Check for traps.

2265
02:49:12,404 --> 02:49:13,489
MATT: Go for it.

2266
02:49:13,489 --> 02:49:16,827
TRAVIS: So mayhaps with the bear entering, there
is enough of a distraction for one suit of armor

2267
02:49:16,827 --> 02:49:18,257
to clankily make its way down?

2268
02:49:18,324 --> 02:49:19,308
SAM: You would think.

2269
02:49:19,308 --> 02:49:22,170
MATT: You guys were caught in the attention with
Trinket, at the same time. So you guys were in the

2270
02:49:22,170 --> 02:49:27,373
middle of the fray, as you were walking past. As
you're bringing Trinket out, the attention is

2271
02:49:27,373 --> 02:49:30,003
pulled away. I want you guys to make another
stealth check.

2272
02:49:30,003 --> 02:49:30,908
ASHLEY: Come on.

2273
02:49:30,908 --> 02:49:32,839
MATT: Grog? You have disadvantage on this one now.

2274
02:49:32,839 --> 02:49:38,124
ASHLEY: Fuck. Ugh. Same rolls. Exact same rolls.

2275
02:49:38,124 --> 02:49:39,768
TRAVIS: 12.

2276
02:49:39,768 --> 02:49:43,085
ASHLEY: Nine.

2277
02:49:43,085 --> 02:49:50,378
MATT: You guys walk past. As you're stepping into
the kitchen, you hear the voice of one of the

2278
02:49:50,378 --> 02:49:54,595
staff, "Excuse me! Excuse me! You can't be back
here! This is our kitchen, we're trying--"

2279
02:49:54,595 --> 02:49:57,020
ASHLEY: I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

2280
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,654
TRAVIS: Yeah, she had a lot to drink!

2281
02:49:58,654 --> 02:49:59,991
ASHLEY: I've had so much to drink!

2282
02:49:59,991 --> 02:50:02,434
TRAVIS: You had a lot to drink, be careful. Yeah,
she's going to spew!

2283
02:50:02,434 --> 02:50:04,020
MATT: "Take it outside! Don't do it in our
kitchen!"

2284
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:05,614
ASHLEY: I need a pan, or something!

2285
02:50:05,614 --> 02:50:10,321
TRAVIS: She's got infectious diseases too! When
she spews, everybody catches it!

2286
02:50:10,321 --> 02:50:12,512
ASHLEY: I have the consumption.

2287
02:50:12,512 --> 02:50:15,443
MATT: Pike, make a deception check. (chuckles)

2288
02:50:15,443 --> 02:50:21,223
I'll say with advantage, since Grog is
aiding you in this.

2289
02:50:21,223 --> 02:50:22,548
ASHLEY: Perception or persuasion?

2290
02:50:22,548 --> 02:50:23,641
MATT: No, deception.

2291
02:50:23,641 --> 02:50:25,328
LAURA: Oh, deception, deception.

2292
02:50:25,328 --> 02:50:30,918
ASHLEY: Deception? Fuck, come on. 12.

2293
02:50:30,918 --> 02:50:32,770
MATT: With advantage, because Grog's helping you.

2294
02:50:32,770 --> 02:50:34,591
LIAM: Come on, gnome!

2295
02:50:34,591 --> 02:50:36,134
ASHLEY: 14.

2296
02:50:36,134 --> 02:50:37,204
MATT: That's better.

2297
02:50:37,204 --> 02:50:39,182
MARISHA: Yeah, hork like you mean it!

2298
02:50:39,182 --> 02:50:47,420
MATT: The guy is like, "Oh, no. No! Not in here!
Um! Right there!" and he points to a doorway on

2299
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:52,433
the other side of the kitchen that leads to the
alleyway. And he's like, "Out there! No, go. Go!"

2300
02:50:52,433 --> 02:50:53,648
ASHLEY: I just start running. I just start
running.

2301
02:50:53,648 --> 02:50:56,190
MATT: Okay. You run and you open the door out into
the alleyway. Grog follows you out.

2302
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:59,315
LAURA: I lead Trinket outside and I see them come
out the alleyway!

2303
02:50:59,315 --> 02:51:01,043
MATT: You do, if you go around the side, yeah.

2304
02:51:01,043 --> 02:51:08,966
LAURA: Okay, yeah. So I have Trinket hang out in
the alley and stay there and wait for us. Be safe,

2305
02:51:08,966 --> 02:51:18,372
Trinket! If any danger comes your way, intimidate
them and run the other direction. Go home. I love you.

2306
02:51:18,372 --> 02:51:22,665
MATT: Trinket just lies there with his head on his
paws.

2307
02:51:22,665 --> 02:51:25,652
LAURA: You guys are evil for making me leave him.

2308
02:51:25,652 --> 02:51:26,591
MATT: All right.

2309
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:29,675
MARISHA: So there are still two cooks in the
kitchen?

2310
02:51:29,675 --> 02:51:33,976
MATT: No, one cook has come back in and is
currently watching her pretend to vomit in the

2311
02:51:33,976 --> 02:51:35,681
alleyway.

2312
02:51:35,681 --> 02:51:39,176
LIAM: I got a 25 when I checked for traps a few
minutes ago?

2313
02:51:39,176 --> 02:51:44,159
MATT: Okay, thank you. There are no traps on this
door, but it is locked.

2314
02:51:44,159 --> 02:51:50,635
LIAM: All right. I don't know what's down there,
but let me take the lead because I've dealt with

2315
02:51:50,635 --> 02:51:57,756
this before. I don't crouch down or anything, I
just start-- still quietly-- but I just walk. Head

2316
02:51:57,756 --> 02:52:02,188
held high, walking down the stairs. Motioning
everyone to follow who's here.

2317
02:52:02,188 --> 02:52:09,336
MATT: Okay. As you're doing this, you begin your
"flaute-off"? I don't know. Roll performance!

2318
02:52:09,336 --> 02:52:15,516
SAM: Am I rolling for performance? 28.

2319
02:52:15,516 --> 02:52:16,893
MATT: 28!

2320
02:52:16,893 --> 02:52:27,220
SAM: I perform very well. (singing) Too many
cooks!

2321
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:29,110
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (singing) Too many cooks!

2322
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:30,217
(laughter)

2323
02:52:30,217 --> 02:52:31,895
ASHLEY: (moans) Oh, don't get it in my head!

2324
02:52:31,895 --> 02:52:36,111
MATT: Hold on, sorry. This is important, guys.
Once I can get the ad off here. So, as you pull

2325
02:52:36,111 --> 02:52:40,436
out your flute and you prepare for this
wondrous--

2326
02:52:40,436 --> 02:52:43,226
SAM: You've got this on your machine?

2327
02:52:43,226 --> 02:52:53,498
(banjo playing)

2328
02:52:53,498 --> 02:52:54,577
SAM: Is this Jethro Tull?

2329
02:52:54,577 --> 02:52:56,265
MATT: Yes it is.

2330
02:52:56,265 --> 02:52:57,358
(laughter)

2331
02:52:57,358 --> 02:52:58,954
LIAM: Yes! Yes!

2332
02:52:58,954 --> 02:53:01,394
MATT: Let's get to the good part here.

2333
02:53:01,394 --> 02:53:03,442
SAM: Is there a good part?

2334
02:53:03,442 --> 02:53:05,315
MATT: This is the whole album.

2335
02:53:05,315 --> 02:53:09,911
MARISHA: It was just one big, full album. The song
was a whole album.

2336
02:53:09,911 --> 02:53:12,554
MATT: Sure, and as the band picks up behind you--

2337
02:53:12,554 --> 02:53:14,269
SAM: Come on, Dr. Dra!

2338
02:53:14,269 --> 02:53:20,127
MATT: Dr. Dranzel picks up his instruments and you
guys start playing back and forth with your flutes

2339
02:53:20,127 --> 02:53:27,532
just picking off-- improvising off of the classic!
(laughs) Make another perform check.

2340
02:53:27,532 --> 02:53:32,682
SAM: Everybody give it up for Zed on drums! 24!

2341
02:53:32,682 --> 02:53:39,031
MATT: All right. Kaylie is trying to keep up and
you can see her face starting to go red. But she's

2342
02:53:39,031 --> 02:53:45,961
determined on this, and she continues pushing this
into an improvisational flurry of notes that

2343
02:53:45,961 --> 02:53:50,823
completely walks around your performance,
previously done. And you find yourself having to

2344
02:53:50,823 --> 02:53:56,592
take a step back as she begins stepping up onto
the table. And now, even at her gnomish height, is

2345
02:53:56,592 --> 02:53:59,594
looking over the entire crowd, as people-- who
were not previously as interested-- are starting

2346
02:53:59,594 --> 02:54:02,277
to turn around and look towards you two play.

2347
02:54:02,277 --> 02:54:08,357
SAM: I can't be one-upped. I use Minor Illusion to
create sort of a mirror image of myself, over

2348
02:54:08,357 --> 02:54:10,848
myself, also playing the flute.

2349
02:54:10,848 --> 02:54:13,179
(laughter)

2350
02:54:13,179 --> 02:54:17,235
MATT: Make another performance check, with
advantage.

2351
02:54:17,235 --> 02:54:23,279
SAM: With advantage? Not as good, 22.

2352
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:24,903
MATT: 22, all right.

2353
02:54:24,903 --> 02:54:29,403
MARISHA: I can't believe the Jethro Tull song with
no flutes was the one you happened to find!

2354
02:54:29,403 --> 02:54:31,183
SAM: It was a ballad! She chose a ballad!

2355
02:54:31,183 --> 02:54:38,510
LIAM: You have the best of Jethro Tull over there,
or what?

2356
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:44,801
MATT: Apparently all Jethro Tull songs don't have
any flute in them! Failure. Big failure on that part.

2357
02:54:44,801 --> 02:54:47,547
SAM: Just play the scene from Anchorman.

2358
02:54:47,547 --> 02:54:51,664
MATT: We're going to go back to the--

2359
02:54:51,664 --> 02:54:53,883
(laughter)

2360
02:54:53,883 --> 02:55:00,577
MATT: You failed me, Tull! Failed me! A great
moment ruined by your inability to play a flute in

2361
02:55:00,577 --> 02:55:01,884
your own album!

2362
02:55:01,884 --> 02:55:03,309
(laughter)

2363
02:55:03,309 --> 02:55:06,158
TALIESIN: Jethro Tull would be a great name for a
Sith.

2364
02:55:06,227 --> 02:55:08,147
LAURA and ASHLEY: It would!

2365
02:55:08,147 --> 02:55:12,373
LIAM: Careful, careful, I'm still raw.

2366
02:55:12,373 --> 02:55:16,396
MATT: Aw. Anyway, as it crescendos and
crescendos-- What did you roll?

2367
02:55:16,396 --> 02:55:17,474
SAM: 22.

2368
02:55:17,474 --> 02:55:23,566
MATT: 22! You can see, now, the volume of her
flute playing begins to pull back, as you begin to

2369
02:55:23,566 --> 02:55:29,555
step up onto the same table next to her. Twice as
high now, with the illusionary Scanlan above you,

2370
02:55:29,555 --> 02:55:33,372
almost like those awkward middle school
superimposed photos of yourself in the upper

2371
02:55:33,372 --> 02:55:34,441
corner.

2372
02:55:34,441 --> 02:55:35,680
SAM: And lasers in the background?

2373
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:40,416
MATT: Yeah! As the music swells, and the drums
start picking up, you see Dranzel has now pulled

2374
02:55:40,416 --> 02:55:45,271
up his violin and he's now furiously fiddling
along with it. The music swells and swells. The

2375
02:55:45,271 --> 02:55:51,738
guy in the kitchen who is looking for you guys
hears this, and now turns his head and goes,

2376
02:55:51,738 --> 02:55:56,775
"What's going on?" And looks back into the room.
Guys, make one more stealth check.

2377
02:55:56,775 --> 02:55:58,002
ASHLEY: Come on.

2378
02:55:58,002 --> 02:55:59,163
TRAVIS: With advantage?

2379
02:55:59,163 --> 02:56:00,312
MATT: No.

2380
02:56:00,312 --> 02:56:01,548
LIAM: We're all doing stealth checks?

2381
02:56:01,548 --> 02:56:02,815
LAURA: No, just me.

2382
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:06,087
TRAVIS: What is fucking going on?

2383
02:56:06,087 --> 02:56:07,956
LAURA: I got 18.

2384
02:56:07,956 --> 02:56:09,464
TRAVIS: 20.

2385
02:56:09,464 --> 02:56:14,900
ASHLEY: We don't have an extra roll? It is what it
is. I have a six.

2386
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:16,465
MATT: Okay. What did you get?

2387
02:56:16,465 --> 02:56:17,759
LAURA: 18.

2388
02:56:17,759 --> 02:56:19,944
ASHLEY: Maybe he'll think it's cymbals or
something.

2389
02:56:19,944 --> 02:56:21,510
MATT: Best two out of three, you make your way
in.

2390
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:23,280
(laughter)

2391
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:26,297
MATT: Thanks to the music, the clanking is over--

2392
02:56:26,297 --> 02:56:30,569
TRAVIS: How about I pick up Pike with my 20, and I
carry her in.

2393
02:56:30,569 --> 02:56:32,665
MATT: Sure! Still works out.

2394
02:56:32,665 --> 02:56:34,106
TRAVIS: Minimal clank.

2395
02:56:34,106 --> 02:56:42,590
MARISHA: Plank. Hold your abs.

2396
02:56:42,590 --> 02:56:49,455
MATT: So, as the music picks up and swells, at
this point, make one final performance check.

2397
02:56:49,455 --> 02:56:55,458
SAM: 27.

2398
02:56:55,458 --> 02:57:03,092
MATT: 27. With this note, you bring once again,
this same duel you guys had when you first entered

2399
02:57:03,092 --> 02:57:07,476
the tavern, and you and Kaylie are facing off,
looking directly at each other, furiously going on

2400
02:57:07,476 --> 02:57:08,515
your flutes.

2401
02:57:08,515 --> 02:57:09,942
SAM: Blowing at each other.

2402
02:57:09,942 --> 02:57:14,818
MATT: Eyes locked, tapping your feet heavily
against the actual wood to the table. The rhythmic

2403
02:57:14,818 --> 02:57:20,229
pounding of your feet and the drums-- because the
entire room now also slamming their tables in with

2404
02:57:20,229 --> 02:57:25,717
it as the music builds and builds until eventually
you both take one deep breath and go for that same

2405
02:57:25,717 --> 02:57:30,264
sustained note a second time. She's challenging
you at the game she lost last time, and the two of

2406
02:57:30,264 --> 02:57:36,515
you both swell into this cacophonous spray of
music that hits this one final note that pierces

2407
02:57:36,515 --> 02:57:40,992
through and all the slamming stops, and everyone
just waits to hear how long it will go. It carries

2408
02:57:40,992 --> 02:57:45,848
and carries and carries. The breath never seems to
end. Roll another performance roll.

2409
02:57:45,848 --> 02:57:47,760
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan!

2410
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:54,134
SAM: It's a 22, but I'm going to let her win.

2411
02:57:54,134 --> 02:58:07,410
MATT: As you begin to trail off the sound of the note, you can 
see she's starting to already go a little blue in the face,

2412
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:12,905
determined to win this. And she's about to falter.
You could win this, if you want to, but are you

2413
02:58:12,905 --> 02:58:14,769
going to let her?

2414
02:58:14,769 --> 02:58:18,252
SAM: With a wink, I end my note.

2415
02:58:18,252 --> 02:58:27,111
MATT: As the flute leaves your lips and you go
into a fake gasp of air, she finishes on a high,

2416
02:58:27,111 --> 02:58:32,627
piercing tune, a trill, and then finishes off,
carrying the flute away with a smile as your

2417
02:58:32,627 --> 02:58:34,059
illusion fades.

2418
02:58:34,059 --> 02:58:38,538
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen, Kaylie's Fine! Ladies
and gentlemen.

2419
02:58:38,538 --> 02:58:46,026
MATT: "You're good, but I'm better."

2420
02:58:46,026 --> 02:58:55,431
SAM: I tip my hat to her and say, yes ma'am. It
seems that tonight, you are. All right, I kick her

2421
02:58:55,431 --> 02:58:58,199
100 gold.

2422
02:58:58,199 --> 02:58:59,290
TRAVIS: What?

2423
02:58:59,290 --> 02:59:01,351
MATT: "You said your purse."

2424
02:59:01,351 --> 02:59:03,569
SAM: Is she going to inspect it?

2425
02:59:03,569 --> 02:59:09,276
MATT: You reach over. Are you going to start
thumbing through your purse and pulling out gold?

2426
02:59:09,276 --> 02:59:12,001
She goes, "No, your purse. You bet your purse."

2427
02:59:12,001 --> 02:59:15,670
SAM: I mean, that was a figure of speech, right?

2428
02:59:15,670 --> 02:59:18,878
LAURA: You totally let her win and you're going to
give her all your money?

2429
02:59:18,878 --> 02:59:20,816
TRAVIS: He forgot about that part.

2430
02:59:20,816 --> 02:59:28,564
MATT: "I spit on it." She looks over to Dranzel.
Dranzel goes, "I did hear you say a full purse."

2431
02:59:28,564 --> 02:59:32,376
LIAM: Oh, I hope there's so much money in that
bag.

2432
02:59:32,376 --> 02:59:34,621
SAM: A deal is a deal.

2433
02:59:34,621 --> 02:59:36,927
TRAVIS: The things you do for women.

2434
02:59:36,927 --> 02:59:39,261
LAURA: Do not give her your money!

2435
02:59:39,261 --> 02:59:41,524
MATT: What are you doing, Scanlan?

2436
02:59:41,524 --> 02:59:43,768
TALIESIN: If there was a piece of advice that ever
lived.

2437
02:59:43,768 --> 02:59:47,882
SAM: I untie the purse and I hand it over.

2438
02:59:47,882 --> 02:59:51,340
LAURA: Do you take any of the gold out secretly
before you hand it over to her?

2439
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:52,463
MATT: You're not there.

2440
02:59:52,463 --> 02:59:53,919
TALIESIN: Such a life lesson.

2441
02:59:53,919 --> 02:59:57,667
MATT: She takes it. How much was in there?

2442
02:59:57,667 --> 02:59:59,457
SAM: 2,600.

2443
02:59:59,457 --> 03:00:09,326
MATT: She takes the chain purse and weighs it.
"Let it be known throughout this tavern that

2444
03:00:09,326 --> 03:00:12,992
"Scanlan Shorthalt is a man of his word."

2445
03:00:12,992 --> 03:00:15,539
SAM: Thank you, my dear.

2446
03:00:15,539 --> 03:00:21,806
MATT: She takes the chain purse and flicks it
away. It vanishes in a puff of smoke. She goes,

2447
03:00:21,806 --> 03:00:24,698
"That's a lot of coin."

2448
03:00:24,698 --> 03:00:26,654
SAM: I get around a lot.

2449
03:00:26,654 --> 03:00:35,203
MATT: "Perhaps we'll have a drink later." And she
steps off the table. Now the rest of you have all

2450
03:00:35,203 --> 03:00:39,395
made your way down into the storage chamber.

2451
03:00:39,395 --> 03:00:42,874
LAURA: Oh god.

2452
03:00:42,874 --> 03:00:48,788
LIAM: Anything we encounter is far easier than
what just happened.

2453
03:00:48,788 --> 03:00:52,698
LAURA: Do you want to cry? Because I would want to cry.

2454
03:00:52,698 --> 03:00:56,204
SAM: Money means nothing to me.

2455
03:00:56,204 --> 03:00:58,297
ASHLEY: Should somebody pickpocket her?

2456
03:00:58,297 --> 03:00:59,711
LAURA: Fuck yeah, man.

2457
03:00:59,711 --> 03:01:02,352
MATT: Are you going to join them?

2458
03:01:02,352 --> 03:01:03,539
SAM: Yes, of course!

2459
03:01:03,539 --> 03:01:04,765
MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check.

2460
03:01:04,765 --> 03:01:11,272
SAM: Oh, wait. Oh yes, I still have to sneak back
there, don't I? I just go invisible.

2461
03:01:11,272 --> 03:01:20,517
MATT: All right, you step under one of the nearby
tables and come out, completely invisible. You

2462
03:01:20,517 --> 03:01:25,870
make your way, stepping through the kitchen,
downstairs and find that you currently, right

2463
03:01:25,870 --> 03:01:29,280
now-- Vax, you are going to unlock the latch, you
said?

2464
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:41,634
LIAM: I'm sorry, I was just thinking of
Wendydoodle's art from the comic. Yeah, yeah, I'm

2465
03:01:41,634 --> 03:01:46,773
going to check that door for traps, is what I'm
going to do.

2466
03:01:46,773 --> 03:01:49,964
MATT: All right, perception check. Wait, you
checked earlier, there's no traps. There's just a

2467
03:01:49,964 --> 03:01:50,908
lock.

2468
03:01:50,908 --> 03:01:53,678
LIAM: Earlier, yeah, I did get a 25 up top, yeah.
I thought you were giving me another door. Yeah,

2469
03:01:53,678 --> 03:01:55,936
25 up top where the fake bags of rice were.

2470
03:01:55,936 --> 03:01:58,224
MATT: Right, but it was still locked, you didn't
roll to--

2471
03:01:58,224 --> 03:02:03,518
LIAM: To pick it, sure, that's no problem. It is a
23.

2472
03:02:03,518 --> 03:02:13,049
MATT: 23, it's a little tough, you just manage to
get it up and it comes off and the latch-- pretty

2473
03:02:13,049 --> 03:02:14,064
solid still.

2474
03:02:14,064 --> 03:02:15,195
LIAM: Amateurs.

2475
03:02:15,195 --> 03:02:21,050
MATT: Okay, you open the (creaks) leads down below
and you find yourself looking down into a familiar

2476
03:02:21,050 --> 03:02:22,890
stairway that leads into darkness.

2477
03:02:22,890 --> 03:02:29,369
LIAM: All right, I know sometimes I can seem like
I'm an idiot, but let me do the talking, yeah? And

2478
03:02:29,369 --> 03:02:32,915
then I start down and lead the way.

2479
03:02:32,915 --> 03:02:39,930
MATT: All right, so, as you push down the
stairway, we're doing marching order here just so

2480
03:02:39,930 --> 03:02:45,830
we have it. So we have currently, you're at the
front, who's behind Vax?

2481
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:47,143
LAURA: Me.

2482
03:02:47,143 --> 03:02:50,267
MATT: All right Vex, you're behind him. Who's
behind Vex?

2483
03:02:50,267 --> 03:02:51,566
TALIESIN: I am.

2484
03:02:51,566 --> 03:02:53,962
MATT: All right, Percy.

2485
03:02:53,962 --> 03:02:55,667
MARISHA: I'm up next.

2486
03:02:55,667 --> 03:03:03,516
MATT: All right, now, Scanlan, Pike, Grog, who's
up next?

2487
03:03:03,516 --> 03:03:05,075
ASHLEY: Oh, do we roll?

2488
03:03:05,075 --> 03:03:07,471
MATT: No, just let me-- Who wants to go after
Keyleth?

2489
03:03:07,471 --> 03:03:10,927
SAM: I'm probably in the back since I was the last
to move.

2490
03:03:10,927 --> 03:03:14,335
MATT: Okay, so Scanlan will be in the back and
then probably Grog next to him and Pike right

2491
03:03:14,335 --> 03:03:15,379
there.

2492
03:03:15,379 --> 03:03:16,785
TALIESIN: He made a little rainbow.

2493
03:03:16,785 --> 03:03:18,057
MARISHA: Oh, it is a rainbow.

2494
03:03:18,057 --> 03:03:20,271
LAURA: It's so pretty.

2495
03:03:20,271 --> 03:03:24,277
TALIESIN: They can't see it because it's off; they
won't be able to see it.

2496
03:03:24,277 --> 03:03:31,410
MATT: There's a reason for that. All right, so, as
you step down, the wood creaking with every

2497
03:03:31,410 --> 03:03:41,657
here-and-there step. It stops, switches back, and
then heads down further. You can see that this

2498
03:03:41,657 --> 03:03:47,964
area of the room is mostly completed in
construction, but a portion of this has been

2499
03:03:47,964 --> 03:03:53,532
rebuilt. If you recall, last time you guys exited,
part of this exit was destroyed. It has been

2500
03:03:53,532 --> 03:03:59,791
reconstructed and there at the bottom of the
stairway is a thick wooden door, wrapped in iron

2501
03:03:59,791 --> 03:04:08,778
bars or strips of iron to keep it nice and taut
and strong, and you can immediately see five locks

2502
03:04:08,778 --> 03:04:11,958
down the side of the door.

2503
03:04:11,958 --> 03:04:18,362
LIAM: Everybody hold up for a second, could we
crowd-surf the bard up to us at the front please?

2504
03:04:18,362 --> 03:04:20,680
SAM: Oh, is that me?

2505
03:04:20,680 --> 03:04:22,772
LIAM: The bard, yes.

2506
03:04:22,772 --> 03:04:24,377
SAM: Grog, toss me forward.

2507
03:04:24,377 --> 03:04:29,470
TRAVIS: Not really getting his meaning, I grab him
by the back of the shirt and I just chuck him.

2508
03:04:29,470 --> 03:04:35,382
MATT: Being at the bottom of a stairway, I want
you to make an acrobatics check.

2509
03:04:35,382 --> 03:04:41,040
SAM: (laughs) Oh, acrobatics, 12.

2510
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:47,707
MATT: 12? Scanlan (boof) on the ground right next
to you, thankfully just missing the bottom stair,

2511
03:04:47,707 --> 03:04:53,231
which would have hurt even worse in the back, but
through the slight toss you take six points of

2512
03:04:53,231 --> 03:04:58,574
damage. The fall. A real crick in your back in
your back in your shoulder from the impact. You

2513
03:04:58,574 --> 03:04:59,651
get up.

2514
03:04:59,651 --> 03:05:01,317
SAM: Thanks Grog, thanks.

2515
03:05:01,317 --> 03:05:04,325
LIAM: I'm gonna scoop a hand under his head and
give him a slap on both sides.

2516
03:05:04,325 --> 03:05:06,258
SAM: (huffs) What are we looking at?

2517
03:05:06,258 --> 03:05:11,368
LIAM: Listen to me. I'm gonna try to do the
talking in here, because I know these people a

2518
03:05:11,368 --> 03:05:14,882
little. But if that fails, I need you. All right?

2519
03:05:14,882 --> 03:05:17,376
SAM: You-- me? Yes, just do my thing?

2520
03:05:17,376 --> 03:05:22,796
LIAM: I need you on ice for a little while, all
right, so just stay between me and my sister.

2521
03:05:22,796 --> 03:05:24,836
SAM: Okay. Yes, yes, sir.

2522
03:05:24,836 --> 03:05:25,793
LIAM: Five locks?

2523
03:05:25,793 --> 03:05:27,017
MATT: Five locks, yes.

2524
03:05:27,017 --> 03:05:32,380
LIAM: I want to perception check for traps and for
Thieves' Cant and anything else.

2525
03:05:32,380 --> 03:05:33,498
MATT: Okay.

2526
03:05:33,498 --> 03:05:37,319
LIAM: That's all right, 20.

2527
03:05:37,319 --> 03:05:47,987
MATT: Okay. Looking about the locks, none of them
look to be trapped. You do notice that there is a

2528
03:05:47,987 --> 03:05:56,474
bit of scratching on the wood next to each lock.
Each one is a different language. What languages

2529
03:05:56,474 --> 03:05:57,972
do you speak?

2530
03:05:57,972 --> 03:06:00,217
LIAM: I speak Elvish, Common, Abyssal.

2531
03:06:00,217 --> 03:06:02,794
LAURA: You speak the same languages as me.

2532
03:06:02,794 --> 03:06:04,979
MATT: It's like you grew up together.

2533
03:06:04,979 --> 03:06:07,190
LAURA: Oh, I also speak Undercommon.

2534
03:06:07,190 --> 03:06:15,654
MATT: Okay. Looking at it, Abyssal-- you do
recognize two of them, and it's the top one and

2535
03:06:15,654 --> 03:06:24,186
the bottom one. And both of them, the equivalent
in Common would be a phrase like: enter, or pass.

2536
03:06:24,186 --> 03:06:26,015
ASHLEY: Is one of them in Underdark?

2537
03:06:26,015 --> 03:06:27,814
MATT: No Undercommon, no.

2538
03:06:27,814 --> 03:06:29,790
LAURA: What about Draconic?

2539
03:06:29,790 --> 03:06:31,877
MATT: Underdark would be Undercommon.

2540
03:06:31,877 --> 03:06:34,138
TALIESIN: Celestial? Elven?

2541
03:06:34,138 --> 03:06:36,018
MATT: Nothing in Elven.

2542
03:06:36,018 --> 03:06:37,275
ASHLEY: Dwarvish?

2543
03:06:37,275 --> 03:06:38,813
MATT: There is a Dwarvish one.

2544
03:06:38,813 --> 03:06:45,166
TRAVIS: Oh, oh! I have a Belt of Dwarvenkind that
lets me read Dwarvish.

2545
03:06:45,166 --> 03:06:47,309
MATT: If you could read.

2546
03:06:47,309 --> 03:06:50,970
(laughter)

2547
03:06:50,970 --> 03:06:53,542
LAURA: But that's okay, Pike can read Dwarvish.

2548
03:06:53,542 --> 03:06:56,164
SAM: It sounds like the Abyssal ones are the ones
that you have to do.

2549
03:06:56,164 --> 03:06:57,795
LIAM: There's five of them.

2550
03:06:57,795 --> 03:06:59,573
SAM: Yeah, but those say 'enter'.

2551
03:06:59,573 --> 03:07:01,885
TALIESIN: We don't know what the other ones say,
though.

2552
03:07:01,885 --> 03:07:12,272
MATT: All right. So. There is the one in the
middle, is in Dwarven. The two of you recognize

2553
03:07:12,272 --> 03:07:16,501
it. You walk up and say: that's Dwarven, but
that's as far as you actually understand. You know

2554
03:07:16,501 --> 03:07:23,435
it's Dwarven. Go ahead and make an intelligence
check, just go for it. Roll a d20 and add your

2555
03:07:23,435 --> 03:07:24,192
modifier.

2556
03:07:24,192 --> 03:07:25,640
TRAVIS: For intelligence?

2557
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:26,640
MATT: Yeah.

2558
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:30,266
TRAVIS: (laughs) Nine.

2559
03:07:30,266 --> 03:07:33,833
LAURA: You have a negative two modifier? (laughs)

2560
03:07:33,833 --> 03:07:38,845
MATT: You-- It's Dwarvish. You know Dwarvish?

2561
03:07:38,845 --> 03:07:39,875
ASHLEY: I do.

2562
03:07:39,875 --> 03:07:45,171
MATT: Okay. Coming up behind Grog and you whisper
to him and let him have the moment. You recognize

2563
03:07:45,171 --> 03:07:49,277
the rune and it's the Common equivalent of entry,
enter.

2564
03:07:49,277 --> 03:07:51,447
LIAM: None of them are in Elvish?

2565
03:07:51,447 --> 03:07:53,039
MATT: No, none of them are in Elvish.

2566
03:07:53,039 --> 03:07:54,930
MARISHA: Sylvan?

2567
03:07:54,930 --> 03:07:57,600
MATT: There's no Elvish whatsoever.

2568
03:07:57,600 --> 03:08:01,199
TRAVIS: This word in Dwarvish means "gentry".

2569
03:08:01,199 --> 03:08:11,626
MATT: Does anyone know Goblin?

2570
03:08:11,626 --> 03:08:14,867
LAURA: Don't you know Goblin, Scanlan?

2571
03:08:14,867 --> 03:08:17,214
SAM: I fucking hate goblins, that doesn't mean I
know their language.

2572
03:08:17,214 --> 03:08:20,178
MATT: And does anyone know Primordial?

2573
03:08:20,178 --> 03:08:21,471
MARISHA: I do.

2574
03:08:21,471 --> 03:08:25,231
TALIESIN: You know Primordial?

2575
03:08:25,295 --> 03:08:31,716
MATT: The fourth one on
the bottom. You have the top one and the bottom

2576
03:08:31,716 --> 03:08:36,243
one, which you read. The middle one in Dwarvish,
which you guys read. The fourth one is a

2577
03:08:36,243 --> 03:08:43,185
Primordial phrase that says the equivalent, and it
is a language of guttural, elemental sounds. It is

2578
03:08:43,185 --> 03:08:50,745
a no, a stop, a general halt type.

2579
03:08:50,745 --> 03:08:52,765
SAM: Shit. Don't do that lock.

2580
03:08:52,765 --> 03:09:00,482
LIAM: So we that leaves one left and we don't know what
says. There's no Thieves' Cant on this door?

2581
03:09:00,549 --> 03:09:06,031
LAURA: So wait, the top one is a yes. The middle
one is a yes. The bottom one is a yes.

2582
03:09:06,031 --> 03:09:08,178
MATT: The second one down.

2583
03:09:08,178 --> 03:09:09,262
LAURA: We don't know.

2584
03:09:09,262 --> 03:09:11,556
MATT: The second one down you do know, that's the
one that says no.

2585
03:09:11,556 --> 03:09:14,213
SAM: The B-slot we don't know.

2586
03:09:14,213 --> 03:09:18,391
LIAM: So all together there's five locks and we
know four of them?

2587
03:09:18,391 --> 03:09:19,826
MATT: You know four of them, yes.

2588
03:09:19,826 --> 03:09:21,737
ASHLEY: Is there any way to try to figure out what
it says?

2589
03:09:21,737 --> 03:09:25,198
MATT: Outside of not knowing the language or any
magical means that would allow you to.

2590
03:09:25,198 --> 03:09:28,361
LIAM: I look at the two in Abyssal. They say
'entry', is that right?

2591
03:09:28,361 --> 03:09:29,517
MATT: Correct.

2592
03:09:29,517 --> 03:09:33,055
LIAM: And I already checked for traps and there
were no traps, just locks

2593
03:09:33,055 --> 03:09:35,704
MATT: No, you have not checked for traps on this
one.

2594
03:09:35,704 --> 03:09:37,277
LIAM: Do I need to check each lock?

2595
03:09:37,277 --> 03:09:40,738
MATT: You would.

2596
03:09:40,738 --> 03:09:42,123
LIAM: Fuck.

2597
03:09:42,123 --> 03:09:48,869
SAM: Why don't you just check the two that are
unknown to us, that are negative?

2598
03:09:48,869 --> 03:09:51,363
MARISHA: Do you want an enhancement of your
abilities?

2599
03:09:51,363 --> 03:09:52,324
LIAM: Yeah.

2600
03:09:52,324 --> 03:10:00,283
MARISHA: Okay. You use dexterity, right? I give
him Cat's Grace? I cast Enhance

2601
03:10:00,283 --> 03:10:01,455
Ability on him.

2602
03:10:01,455 --> 03:10:02,903
SAM: You're making this shit up.

2603
03:10:02,903 --> 03:10:04,893
MARISHA: Kind of, yeah.

2604
03:10:04,893 --> 03:10:09,984
MATT: All right. So Keyleth reaches out and you
feel your form become even more-- So you have

2605
03:10:09,984 --> 03:10:13,430
advantage now on dexterity checks for as long as
she remains concentration on the spell.

2606
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:17,334
LIAM: So we got Abyssal, Abyssal, Dwarven in the
middle and--

2607
03:10:17,334 --> 03:10:20,375
MATT: Primordial on the second to last.

2608
03:10:20,375 --> 03:10:22,203
LIAM: And the Primordial says no, yeah?

2609
03:10:22,203 --> 03:10:23,178
MATT: Correct.

2610
03:10:23,178 --> 03:10:25,922
LIAM: The Abyssals say yes and the Dwarven said
what?

2611
03:10:25,922 --> 03:10:28,350
LAURA: Yes. They all say enter, entry.

2612
03:10:28,350 --> 03:10:35,958
LIAM: So I want to try to pick the three that I
know. Two Abyssals and the Dwarven say entry. And I

2613
03:10:35,958 --> 03:10:37,776
have advantage on.

2614
03:10:37,776 --> 03:10:39,257
LAURA: Did you check for traps?

2615
03:10:39,257 --> 03:10:41,009
LIAM: I did. I checked for traps, right?

2616
03:10:41,009 --> 03:10:42,824
MATT: You're rolling right now to check for
traps.

2617
03:10:42,824 --> 03:10:45,528
LIAM: I'm rolling right now to check for traps.

2618
03:10:45,528 --> 03:10:46,736
MATT: All right, go for it.

2619
03:10:46,736 --> 03:10:48,855
LIAM: So the top is Abyssal. Here I go.

2620
03:10:48,855 --> 03:10:50,870
LAURA: Natural 20!

2621
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:53,540
MATT: The top one is locked, but it is not
trapped.

2622
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:55,744
SAM: Go for the middle.

2623
03:10:55,744 --> 03:10:57,256
LIAM: No, I'm gonna unlock that.

2624
03:10:57,256 --> 03:10:59,399
MATT: Okay, go for it. With advantage.

2625
03:10:59,399 --> 03:11:01,382
LIAM: With advantage.

2626
03:11:01,382 --> 03:11:02,597
LAURA: Balls!

2627
03:11:02,597 --> 03:11:08,070
LIAM: Four, so that's okay. This is lock-pick,
right? 23.

2628
03:11:08,070 --> 03:11:12,294
MATT: 23. Not a very complicated lock, the top
one (click). Comes off without a problem.

2629
03:11:12,294 --> 03:11:14,996
Perfectly silently, you just pull the latch back.
(creaks)

2630
03:11:14,996 --> 03:11:18,785
LIAM: All right. I'm gonna go down to the bottom,
to the Abyssal at the bottom. Checking for traps.

2631
03:11:18,785 --> 03:11:21,385
LAURA: Natural 20!

2632
03:11:21,385 --> 03:11:23,607
MATT: You don't have advantage on checking for
traps.

2633
03:11:23,607 --> 03:11:25,256
LIAM: Oh, I thought you said I did.

2634
03:11:25,256 --> 03:11:30,674
MATT: No, for making the checks you do. This is
for dexterity, checking for traps is a perception

2635
03:11:30,674 --> 03:11:31,512
roll.

2636
03:11:31,512 --> 03:11:32,770
LIAM: Perception's 20.

2637
03:11:32,770 --> 03:11:34,864
MATT: Okay. Bottom one, not trapped.

2638
03:11:34,864 --> 03:11:37,374
LIAM: All right. Dwarven in the middle. Checking
for traps.

2639
03:11:37,374 --> 03:11:38,681
MATT: Go for it.

2640
03:11:38,681 --> 03:11:39,951
LIAM: 20.

2641
03:11:39,951 --> 03:11:42,428
MATT: That one is also not trapped.

2642
03:11:42,428 --> 03:11:47,150
LIAM: All right. That's three, the fourth one was
Primordial.

2643
03:11:47,150 --> 03:11:48,348
LAURA: Yes, and don't--

2644
03:11:48,348 --> 03:11:52,876
LIAM: 20.

2645
03:11:52,876 --> 03:11:54,864
MATT: That one is trapped.

2646
03:11:54,864 --> 03:11:59,288
LIAM: And the Primordial said no.

2647
03:11:59,288 --> 03:12:06,085
MARISHA: Yeah. In their language it's pronounced
huh-gluf.

2648
03:12:06,085 --> 03:12:09,163
LIAM: But what does it mean? We've got three traps.

2649
03:12:09,163 --> 03:12:15,165
SAM: What the fuck is wrong with you? The ones
that say no are trapped! How is this hard to

2650
03:12:15,165 --> 03:12:16,402
understand?!

2651
03:12:16,402 --> 03:12:21,499
LIAM: That is 26, the last one.

2652
03:12:21,499 --> 03:12:24,519
MATT: The second one? The one that--

2653
03:12:24,519 --> 03:12:25,944
LIAM: That we don't know what it is.

2654
03:12:25,944 --> 03:12:29,351
MATT: You've seen scribbles like this before. It
appears to be some sort of goblinoid language but

2655
03:12:29,351 --> 03:12:32,381
none of you actually understand what it says. Does
appear to be trapped.

2656
03:12:32,381 --> 03:12:33,923
LIAM: Does appear to be trapped.

2657
03:12:33,923 --> 03:12:36,085
LAURA: How about you don't unlock those ones.

2658
03:12:36,085 --> 03:12:37,710
TRAVIS: No, no, don't tell him.

2659
03:12:37,710 --> 03:12:41,715
LIAM: I'm not alone, and this affects you,
asshole.

2660
03:12:41,761 --> 03:12:45,264
ASHLEY: Unlock the ones that are not
trapped.

2661
03:12:45,331 --> 03:12:49,720
MARISHA: You already popped the top lock and
nothing happened, right?

2662
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:59,141
LIAM: So there's two that are trapped. I'm going
to attempt to disarm the two that are trapped.

2663
03:12:59,203 --> 03:13:00,511
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that.

2664
03:13:00,511 --> 03:13:02,249
SAM: What are you doing?

2665
03:13:02,249 --> 03:13:05,708
LIAM: This affects you, you dark sword-wielding
dick!

2666
03:13:05,708 --> 03:13:07,560
TRAVIS: No, I'm serious, you had a good thought!

2667
03:13:07,560 --> 03:13:11,632
SAM: Why would you do that? Do the ones that
aren't trapped first.

2668
03:13:11,632 --> 03:13:17,943
LIAM: Everybody wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody
please walk up the stairs ten feet, please.

2669
03:13:17,943 --> 03:13:18,940
ASHLEY: No!

2670
03:13:18,940 --> 03:13:21,317
LIAM: Yeah, walk up the stairs. Ten feet.

2671
03:13:21,317 --> 03:13:22,778
LAURA: I'm walking away.

2672
03:13:22,778 --> 03:13:24,781
LIAM: You're all gonna see it.

2673
03:13:24,781 --> 03:13:26,862
SAM: What are you doing?

2674
03:13:26,862 --> 03:13:32,018
LIAM: I'm gonna try to open the door, you little
asshole. But I don't want you to get burned while

2675
03:13:32,018 --> 03:13:33,058
I get burned.

2676
03:13:33,058 --> 03:13:36,610
SAM: I won't be burned because you're not gonna
mess with the traps! Just do the ones that aren't

2677
03:13:36,610 --> 03:13:38,449
trapped!

2678
03:13:38,449 --> 03:13:44,206
TRAVIS: I walk forward and I grab Scanlan and
everybody and I back everybody up ten feet.

2679
03:13:44,206 --> 03:13:49,405
LAURA: Try the ones that aren't trapped
first, please?

2680
03:13:49,405 --> 03:14:05,306
SAM: All right. I'm gonna quickly inspire him. I'm
gonna read him a limerick.

2681
03:14:05,493 --> 03:14:07,089
MATT: Go for it.

2682
03:14:07,089 --> 03:14:12,692
SAM: I knew a goliath in Whitestone
Who lived in a very, very fine home

2683
03:14:12,692 --> 03:14:21,180
'Til one day a wizard, or maybe a large lizard
Burned it and left him alone.

2684
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:26,373
LIAM: Okay. So of the five at the top and the
bottom and the middle, it's Abyssal, Abyssal,

2685
03:14:26,373 --> 03:14:31,088
Dwarven. And I checked those for traps and there
aren't any so I'm gonna unlock them, all right. So

2686
03:14:31,088 --> 03:14:32,454
for the top one.

2687
03:14:32,454 --> 03:14:34,455
SAM: You did the top already.

2688
03:14:34,455 --> 03:14:35,603
LIAM: Check for traps or?

2689
03:14:35,603 --> 03:14:37,136
ALL: You unlocked it.

2690
03:14:37,136 --> 03:14:40,195
MATT: You unlocked the top one. And the latch came
open without a problem.

2691
03:14:40,195 --> 03:14:42,063
LAURA: Do the middle one.

2692
03:14:42,063 --> 03:14:46,146
LIAM: Can I use what I just rolled for the middle
one?

2693
03:14:46,146 --> 03:14:50,371
TRAVIS: Make sure you disarm the other two.

2694
03:14:50,371 --> 03:14:55,697
LIAM: There's too many people talking, I don't
know what's going on. I don't know what's going

2695
03:14:55,697 --> 03:15:04,407
on. Yeah, I just rolled a ten twice, and that's a
23.

2696
03:15:04,407 --> 03:15:08,650
MATT: 23? (clicking) The middle one opens.
(creaking)

2697
03:15:08,650 --> 03:15:11,005
LIAM: Now the bottom one-- shush!

2698
03:15:11,005 --> 03:15:13,141
MATT: Go for it.

2699
03:15:13,141 --> 03:15:17,405
LIAM: Okay. (laughs) 29.

2700
03:15:17,405 --> 03:15:22,571
MATT: 29. The bottom one you-- It's a different
type of latch that's actually a rod that pushes

2701
03:15:22,663 --> 03:15:27,083
into the door. You manage to find a break in the
wood where it's split and you put an instrument

2702
03:15:27,083 --> 03:15:31,003
and you pull the latch open. So those three are
now currently unlocked.

2703
03:15:31,003 --> 03:15:32,642
LAURA: Try pushing the door.

2704
03:15:32,642 --> 03:15:34,463
TRAVIS: No, no, think of your team, make sure
they're all disarmed.

2705
03:15:34,463 --> 03:15:36,810
(laughter)

2706
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:42,345
LIAM: So here's where we don't know what's going
on. We got number one, number three, and number

2707
03:15:42,345 --> 03:15:46,669
five are untrapped, unlocked. Number two and
number four are trapped, but I'm just pushing the

2708
03:15:46,669 --> 03:15:48,057
door open?

2709
03:15:48,057 --> 03:15:49,898
LAURA: Do whatever you want to do.

2710
03:15:49,898 --> 03:15:53,222
LIAM: But I don't have to make the decision on my
own, because you're all ten feet away from me.

2711
03:15:53,222 --> 03:15:56,163
LAURA: Try disarming them, sure, why not? Do your
thing

2712
03:15:56,163 --> 03:16:02,619
TRAVIS: (singing) Follow your heart, don't blow up
your head to solve those fucking locks. Do it,

2713
03:16:02,619 --> 03:16:03,959
man.

2714
03:16:03,959 --> 03:16:08,202
MARISHA: You've got advantage, so why not, fuck
it.

2715
03:16:08,202 --> 03:16:13,759
MATT: Vax. What is your choice? What do you wish
to do in this moment? You have three untrapped

2716
03:16:13,759 --> 03:16:19,067
locks open, two locks that seem to be trapped. One
of which said no.

2717
03:16:19,067 --> 03:16:21,168
LIAM: Yeah, I'm gonna open it.

2718
03:16:21,168 --> 03:16:29,610
MATT: You push the door open. As you push on the
door, the two locks on there give no resistance.

2719
03:16:29,610 --> 03:16:36,583
Seems they were both false locks and as the door
opens you get the feeling that perhaps the traps were based

2720
03:16:36,583 --> 03:16:39,532
on the attempt to pick them, or disarm.

2721
03:16:39,532 --> 03:16:41,356
LAURA: Good job, good job, brother.

2722
03:16:41,356 --> 03:16:44,531
ASHLEY: High five.

2723
03:16:44,531 --> 03:16:46,105
LIAM: No high fives.

2724
03:16:46,105 --> 03:16:49,072
ASHLEY: Just maybe-- just like a touch then.

2725
03:16:49,072 --> 03:16:50,073
LIAM: Here.

2726
03:16:50,073 --> 03:16:51,130
ASHLEY: Okay.

2727
03:16:51,130 --> 03:16:52,444
(laughter)

2728
03:16:52,444 --> 03:17:01,335
MATT: You're now looking into a familiar very dark
hallway with very low light by a few torch sconces

2729
03:17:01,335 --> 03:17:06,385
that just flicker. The material used to keep them
burning, pretty low and the embers are starting to

2730
03:17:06,385 --> 03:17:11,683
drift into a small pile of soot on the stone floor
beneath them. You can smell the remaining smoke

2731
03:17:11,683 --> 03:17:17,935
and scent of burning wood. To the right of you is
a hallway that continues down to where Spireling

2732
03:17:17,935 --> 03:17:23,697
Modeth once lived before you cut his head off. The
doors are closed to that room and it curves off to

2733
03:17:23,697 --> 03:17:25,785
the left down a long hallway.

2734
03:17:25,785 --> 03:17:31,395
To the left of where you currently are, the
hallway continues into darkness and turns around

2735
03:17:31,395 --> 03:17:33,464
the corner into shadow.

2736
03:17:33,464 --> 03:17:39,869
LIAM: Okay, so there was a cell that we were in,
and there was a larger room where we were

2737
03:17:39,869 --> 03:17:42,309
surrounded by Modeth and a lot of people.

2738
03:17:42,309 --> 03:17:44,512
ASHLEY: But there were a lot of hallways

2739
03:17:44,512 --> 03:17:48,053
TALIESIN: Do we smell anything?

2740
03:17:48,053 --> 03:17:53,574
MATT: You smell the residue of burnt wood and
tinder. Nothing beyond that.

2741
03:17:53,574 --> 03:17:59,435
LAURA: Do I see any tracks that look like they
could have been from an elf, an old guy with some

2742
03:17:59,435 --> 03:18:00,519
battle scars.

2743
03:18:00,519 --> 03:18:02,187
MATT: Make a survival check.

2744
03:18:02,187 --> 03:18:05,867
TRAVIS: Oh, I could do those too. Can I help her
with that?

2745
03:18:05,867 --> 03:18:11,426
MATT: No. Sorry, her ranger tracking training is
far beyond anything you as a barbarian have

2746
03:18:11,426 --> 03:18:15,126
attempted. Though you are good at tracking
naturally as a barbarian, you could attempt to

2747
03:18:15,126 --> 03:18:17,278
make a roll on your own. But it wouldn't be
helping her with it.

2748
03:18:17,278 --> 03:18:18,682
LAURA: 21.

2749
03:18:18,682 --> 03:18:29,121
MATT: Okay. Looking about the stone floor, you do
see scuff marks and where dust has been pushed

2750
03:18:29,121 --> 03:18:33,509
aside by boots. Many footfalls have come through
this area, but there's no way to really ascertain

2751
03:18:33,509 --> 03:18:37,363
any recent traffic or direction.

2752
03:18:37,363 --> 03:18:39,819
LAURA: I would have had to roll a 20, I bet.

2753
03:18:39,819 --> 03:18:44,313
LIAM: While we're waiting, I'm gonna throw my hood
over one shoulder and I'm gonna undo my sleeves so

2754
03:18:44,313 --> 03:18:47,572
that-- Oh, the Clasp is back here, isn't it?

2755
03:18:47,572 --> 03:18:53,327
LAURA: Just take your shirt off. Show it to the
world. I'm gonna cast Pass without a Trace on all

2756
03:18:53,327 --> 03:18:54,330
of us.

2757
03:18:54,330 --> 03:18:56,871
MARISHA: So wait, are there two different
directions?

2758
03:18:56,871 --> 03:18:58,727
MATT: Yeah, so the right or the left.

2759
03:18:58,727 --> 03:19:02,653
MARISHA: Can I ascertain if there's any type of
draft or any--?

2760
03:19:02,653 --> 03:19:04,320
MATT: Percival already tried that.

2761
03:19:04,320 --> 03:19:05,785
MARISHA: Oh, you already tried?

2762
03:19:05,785 --> 03:19:09,530
LIAM: So, here's what I'm thinking. I mean, we
could sneak through here and this one's going to

2763
03:19:09,530 --> 03:19:12,175
sound like a herd of--

2764
03:19:12,175 --> 03:19:14,086
LAURA: Not necessarily. I just cast Pass Without a
Trace.

2765
03:19:14,086 --> 03:19:16,552
SAM: Don't disparage her, she's wonderful and
beautiful.

2766
03:19:16,552 --> 03:19:24,961
LIAM: Our chances of sneaking through here are
low. I could try to talk us through. This guy's a

2767
03:19:24,961 --> 03:19:31,272
threat to them because the kingdom wants him and
they're housing him. And that is not really

2768
03:19:31,272 --> 03:19:36,862
financially viable. So I feel like perhaps we talk
our way out of this. We don't have to go in

2769
03:19:36,862 --> 03:19:40,256
banging an evil sword, not that we have one.

2770
03:19:40,256 --> 03:19:43,115
LAURA: Yeah, we're down here, obviously we
belong.

2771
03:19:43,115 --> 03:19:45,687
LIAM: I belong. And I will vouch for you.

2772
03:19:45,687 --> 03:19:47,533
LAURA: Beautiful. Let's do it.

2773
03:19:47,533 --> 03:19:51,916
MARISHA: I definitely would rather not fight the
entire thieves' guild.

2774
03:19:51,916 --> 03:19:58,350
SAM: We're not sneaking, then? 'Cause if we did
sneak, we could-- Don't you have Fly or

2775
03:19:58,350 --> 03:19:59,781
something?

2776
03:19:59,781 --> 03:20:02,027
LIAM: We're in a very thin hallway right now.

2777
03:20:02,027 --> 03:20:03,818
SAM: All she'd have to do is fly just off the-

2778
03:20:03,818 --> 03:20:07,926
LAURA: I've got no flying. I used my only flying
potion.

2779
03:20:07,926 --> 03:20:13,103
SAM: All right. All right, so we're talking our
way out of it?

2780
03:20:13,103 --> 03:20:20,363
LIAM: I'm gonna call out. I'm calling out, "Member
of the Clasp entering. I need to parlay."

2781
03:20:20,363 --> 03:20:26,544
MATT: A moment passes and you see stepping out of
both sides of the hallway a number of hooded

2782
03:20:26,544 --> 03:20:36,317
figures. Five. Ten. 15 individuals then begin
to close in, all hoods up, cloaks around them, you

2783
03:20:36,317 --> 03:20:40,703
can see through the dim light the crest of chins.
Those of you that have darkvision, you can see

2784
03:20:40,703 --> 03:20:47,803
some features, they all are humanoid, around human
height, a few that are smaller, whether they be

2785
03:20:47,803 --> 03:20:51,244
younger or halfling or gnomish in origin, you
can't really make out their details in this

2786
03:20:51,244 --> 03:20:57,922
circumstance, but they all close in as you guys
all stand there in the center of the hallway.

2787
03:20:57,922 --> 03:21:03,778
LIAM: I do start unlacing, and I say, I'm one of
you. And I show the tattoo on my back.

2788
03:21:03,778 --> 03:21:09,233
MATT: As this happens, you can see there's a part
in the crowd, and one much larger than the rest of

2789
03:21:09,233 --> 03:21:15,725
the members of the Clasp steps forward, pushing
others out of the way. You see a very thick square

2790
03:21:15,725 --> 03:21:21,630
jaw piercing out from underneath the shadowed
hood, and the hand pulls it back and as you can

2791
03:21:21,630 --> 03:21:30,524
now see the crooked pointed ears, snarling nose
and underbite of a mostly orcish half-orc, one

2792
03:21:30,524 --> 03:21:32,978
you've encountered once before--

2793
03:21:32,978 --> 03:21:34,305
LIAM: It's Modeth?

2794
03:21:34,305 --> 03:21:40,721
MATT: No, no. Modeth was human, you killed Modeth.
The orc steps forward and looks about the group

2795
03:21:40,721 --> 03:21:48,028
and goes, (grunts) "Seems like you stumbled into an
early grave."

2796
03:21:48,028 --> 03:21:53,917
LIAM: I didn't stumble, I've been here before.
I've a fucked up past with this organisation but

2797
03:21:53,917 --> 03:21:58,842
I've come to tell you-- And I'm pointing at the
tattoo.

2798
03:21:58,842 --> 03:22:04,615
MATT: He reaches out and grabs your arm and spins
you around to look at the tattoo on your back

2799
03:22:04,615 --> 03:22:14,003
violently. Like a ragdoll. You're being treated
like a child. (grunts) Releases you for a second,

2800
03:22:14,003 --> 03:22:19,634
as you fall off-balance for a second but catch
yourself. He has his other hand at his belt side,

2801
03:22:19,634 --> 03:22:24,462
and you can see what looks to be the the pommel of
the dagger at the ready and he goes--

2802
03:22:24,462 --> 03:22:30,825
LIAM: Sovereign Uriel knows you have Daxio here.
Uriel wants him. You are in danger. This whole

2803
03:22:30,825 --> 03:22:33,346
organisation is in danger with him here.

2804
03:22:33,346 --> 03:22:38,573
MATT: "Silence! Who else knows you're here?"

2805
03:22:38,573 --> 03:22:40,493
LAURA: Not a soul.

2806
03:22:40,493 --> 03:22:56,036
MATT: "Wait a second. I do know you. Customs
department, wasn't it?"

2807
03:22:56,036 --> 03:23:04,617
SAM: I've been promoted since then. I'm now a
supervisor of-- it was a ruse. I apologise for it.

2808
03:23:04,617 --> 03:23:13,718
MATT: "As we found out. So you break back into our
facility--"

2809
03:23:13,718 --> 03:23:18,048
LAURA: We didn't exactly break in, we just kind
of-- I'm just shutting up.

2810
03:23:18,048 --> 03:23:21,303
SAM: He's a member of the Clasp. He gained entry
the way that you do.

2811
03:23:21,303 --> 03:23:31,967
MATT: "He brings in outsiders after being warned
not to return with them. Yet you say you are here

2812
03:23:31,967 --> 03:23:33,923
"for a-- who was it?"

2813
03:23:33,923 --> 03:23:39,254
LIAM: Do you care that the Emperor knows you're
holding a person he wants?

2814
03:23:39,254 --> 03:23:46,248
MATT: "He won't be held for long. You can tell the
Emperor he's not a worry of ours soon."

2815
03:23:46,248 --> 03:23:48,791
LAURA: Where's he going?

2816
03:23:48,791 --> 03:23:55,269
LIAM: He's a traitor to the kingdom. Uriel wants
him, you are bringing danger upon this house.

2817
03:23:55,269 --> 03:23:57,096
MATT: "Uriel's useless."

2818
03:23:57,096 --> 03:24:00,893
LAURA: Uriel has a lot of gold and will probably
give a reward.

2819
03:24:00,893 --> 03:24:06,709
MATT: (laughs) "We have our hand in their coffers
whether we get a reward or not."

2820
03:24:06,709 --> 03:24:15,462
SAM: Not the kind of reward he's already offering
you. We come bearing an offering from Sovereign

2821
03:24:15,462 --> 03:24:20,996
Uriel himself in exchange for this man. I reach
into my bag and I produce--

2822
03:24:20,996 --> 03:24:24,742
ASHLEY: No gold. No money.

2823
03:24:24,742 --> 03:24:34,355
SAM: The very elegantly carved box I had made that
contains the magical blue shard that we discovered

2824
03:24:34,355 --> 03:24:41,109
many, many years ago, and I open it just for a
moment and close it and say, this is the Shard of

2825
03:24:41,109 --> 03:24:48,568
Kara. It is a magical item that can grant the user
one wish, any wish.

2826
03:24:48,568 --> 03:24:51,411
LAURA: But Scanlan, you said we were going to keep
that for ourselves.

2827
03:24:51,411 --> 03:24:56,290
SAM: I did. But it's clear that this man knows who
we are and why we've come.

2828
03:24:56,290 --> 03:24:57,954
LAURA: No.

2829
03:24:57,954 --> 03:25:04,407
SAM: As a last resort we are cleared to offer this
to you in exchange for your prisoner, or is he--

2830
03:25:04,407 --> 03:25:09,055
are you holding him as a prisoner or--?

2831
03:25:09,055 --> 03:25:14,900
MATT: He shushes you. Make a deception check.

2832
03:25:14,900 --> 03:25:17,901
LAURA: Can I help him? Can I assist that?

2833
03:25:17,901 --> 03:25:23,561
MATT: You know what, you would be, so go ahead and
that would give you advantage on this, so--

2834
03:25:23,561 --> 03:25:29,698
SAM: Deception or persuasion?

2835
03:25:29,698 --> 03:25:32,542
MATT: This is deception.

2836
03:25:32,542 --> 03:25:33,850
SAM: 32.

2837
03:25:33,850 --> 03:25:36,190
TALIESIN: What in the living--

2838
03:25:36,190 --> 03:25:39,081
MATT: "Let me see your box."

2839
03:25:39,081 --> 03:25:41,541
LAURA: Oh, well.

2840
03:25:41,541 --> 03:25:43,250
MATT: "Hush!"

2841
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:50,417
SAM: It is activated by a secret chant that we
will only tell you once we are safe and the

2842
03:25:50,417 --> 03:25:55,512
prisoner-- or keep-- I don't know. Are you keeping
him as a prisoner or--

2843
03:25:55,512 --> 03:25:57,250
MATT: He waves his hand and shushes you.

2844
03:25:57,250 --> 03:26:00,320
SAM: All right, as soon as we get the man, you get
the chant.

2845
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:10,064
MATT: "Daxio, huh? (huffs) He just paid us a
rather large sum of money to produce documentation and

2846
03:26:10,064 --> 03:26:18,564
"acquire transit to Ank'harel. We've kept him here
while we've prepared his documentation and we're

2847
03:26:18,564 --> 03:26:28,822
"to send him on his way through our tunnels to the
docks. So you're asking us to betray a client of

2848
03:26:28,822 --> 03:26:30,133
"the Clasp?"

2849
03:26:30,133 --> 03:26:32,566
LIAM: And avoid the hammer of the Empire.

2850
03:26:32,566 --> 03:26:34,578
TRAVIS: And keep the money at the same time.

2851
03:26:34,578 --> 03:26:36,769
MARISHA: Sounds to me like you just won twice.

2852
03:26:36,769 --> 03:26:40,592
MATT: He reaches his hand out for the box.

2853
03:26:40,592 --> 03:26:51,510
SAM: Where is he? Where is he? All right, here.
You can inspect it, scan it for magic if you'd like.

2854
03:26:51,510 --> 03:26:59,070
MATT: Takes the box and hands it to one of his
compatriots, who takes it and inspects it and

2855
03:26:59,070 --> 03:27:01,605
pulls out a small glass, puts it over his eye--

2856
03:27:01,605 --> 03:27:09,766
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft a little bit and
Druidcraft a little bit of breeze seeping from the box?

2857
03:27:09,766 --> 03:27:17,490
TALIESIN: I pull out a small note that I hold in
my right hand.

2858
03:27:17,490 --> 03:27:21,113
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

2859
03:27:21,113 --> 03:27:22,783
MARISHA: Sleight of hand?

2860
03:27:22,783 --> 03:27:25,111
LAURA: Ah, damn it.

2861
03:27:25,111 --> 03:27:32,248
MARISHA: Oh! Did you see that? That was awesome.
21.

2862
03:27:32,248 --> 03:27:38,328
MATT: 21. You mutter beneath your breath and swivel
your hand for a second as he hands-- the other

2863
03:27:38,328 --> 03:27:45,555
individual inspecting it with the glass monocle
looking piece. (whoosh) Wind drifts around it and

2864
03:27:45,555 --> 03:27:51,902
you can see the wood itself almost shimmer as if the
grain of the wood is moving in a pattern.

2865
03:27:51,902 --> 03:27:59,029
TALIESIN: I hold up a beautiful elegant note that
I show in my hand and put it in my breast pocket.

2866
03:27:59,029 --> 03:28:09,477
MATT: "Very well. We have him in holding, awaiting
his documents. I'll show you. I'll leave the door

2867
03:28:09,477 --> 03:28:14,880
"open, we'll clear the halls. Do what you must. We
will not be involved. You have an hour."

2868
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:16,734
LAURA: That's all we need.

2869
03:28:16,734 --> 03:28:20,364
MATT: "What is your password?"

2870
03:28:20,364 --> 03:28:25,361
TALIESIN: Once he is free, then you get-- in our
custody, then you get the note.

2871
03:28:25,361 --> 03:28:27,573
LAURA: We'll leave it outside the door.

2872
03:28:27,573 --> 03:28:32,737
MATT: (chuckles) He puts his hand like this and
other individuals of the Clasp back out and leave

2873
03:28:32,737 --> 03:28:35,357
into the hallway behind you and he leads you to follow
him and--

2874
03:28:35,357 --> 03:28:42,744
MARISHA: I say, careful. Do not open that box
without the password or else it will melt your

2875
03:28:42,744 --> 03:28:44,551
eyeballs from inside your head.

2876
03:28:44,551 --> 03:28:48,387
(laughter)

2877
03:28:48,387 --> 03:28:50,203
MATT: Make a deception check.

2878
03:28:50,203 --> 03:28:52,153
TRAVIS: Unnecessary.

2879
03:28:52,153 --> 03:28:53,852
LAURA: He was going for it!

2880
03:28:53,928 --> 03:28:55,224
LIAM: We had the mark!

2881
03:28:55,224 --> 03:28:58,607
SAM: Is this deception, what is this?

2882
03:28:58,607 --> 03:28:59,940
MARISHA: 11.

2883
03:28:59,940 --> 03:29:02,513
MATT: He takes a few steps and turns and looks at
you.

2884
03:29:02,513 --> 03:29:06,017
MARISHA: You never know, it acts in mysterious
ways.

2885
03:29:06,017 --> 03:29:07,601
MATT: (box lid creaks)

2886
03:29:07,601 --> 03:29:09,180
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

2887
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:14,529
MATT: Opens the box. Inspects the piece of blue
crystal--

2888
03:29:14,529 --> 03:29:16,639
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft a gust coming out of
it?

2889
03:29:16,639 --> 03:29:18,732
MATT: I would not recommend it.

2890
03:29:18,732 --> 03:29:20,185
MARISHA: Okay!

2891
03:29:20,185 --> 03:29:28,166
MATT: He looks over at the gentleman who inspected
it earlier and nods his head. "Accepted." And they

2892
03:29:28,166 --> 03:29:30,007
continue walking forward.

2893
03:29:30,007 --> 03:29:33,259
TRAVIS: Lucky fucking druid.

2894
03:29:33,259 --> 03:29:36,236
MATT: It is the piece you put in the actual--

2895
03:29:36,236 --> 03:29:41,568
SAM: It's a blue shard that we found in-- long,
long ago-- it's real crystal and it's real magic.

2896
03:29:41,568 --> 03:29:43,520
MATT: Yes. I know what that is.

2897
03:29:43,520 --> 03:29:44,859
SAM: Because I don't.

2898
03:29:44,859 --> 03:29:47,552
MATT: Well, it was sufficient upon inspection for
this.

2899
03:29:47,552 --> 03:29:49,014
SAM: Okay.

2900
03:29:49,014 --> 03:29:50,863
LAURA: Whoa, I think it opens a portal to another
plane.

2901
03:29:50,863 --> 03:29:52,622
SAM: I don't know what it is, but it's magic.

2902
03:29:52,622 --> 03:29:59,365
MARISHA: Is it the one we got at last Winter's
Crest? That one? The one that we were using

2903
03:29:59,365 --> 03:30:03,341
shards of it to carve through dimensions? Cool.

2904
03:30:03,341 --> 03:30:10,598
MATT: It had a few uses. So as you guys move into
the hallway, a bunch of the Clasp members leave,

2905
03:30:10,598 --> 03:30:14,898
you're led down a couple of doors on the left and
right. You guys recognise these, these are the

2906
03:30:14,898 --> 03:30:18,619
holding cells that you guys were held shortly
after your battle.

2907
03:30:18,619 --> 03:30:20,604
ASHLEY: Yep, we were held in these cells.

2908
03:30:20,604 --> 03:30:29,056
MATT: So the cell on the left is closed, the cell
on the right is closed. He walks up to that cell,

2909
03:30:29,056 --> 03:30:35,480
and without even a bit of noise pulls out a
keyring, unlocks it and puts the keys away.

2910
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:41,323
(grunts) Turns around and the rest of the Clasp
scatter out of the hallway. He puts the box away

2911
03:30:41,323 --> 03:30:45,363
in his cloak and he says, "One hour. Do as you
must."

2912
03:30:45,363 --> 03:30:55,510
LIAM: I take the keys. We've got two to choose
from?

2913
03:30:55,510 --> 03:30:58,305
MATT: He's at the door. He unlocked one for you
guys.

2914
03:30:58,305 --> 03:31:00,697
LIAM: No, no. But there's two cells? Or has he
opened the cell that he's in?

2915
03:31:00,697 --> 03:31:04,448
MATT: There are three cells in this hallway. The
middle cell is the one that he led you to and

2916
03:31:04,448 --> 03:31:05,749
unlocked for you.

2917
03:31:05,749 --> 03:31:06,681
LIAM: Okay, thanks.

2918
03:31:06,681 --> 03:31:09,019
MATT: And he steps away, looks at the rest of you
guys--

2919
03:31:09,019 --> 03:31:10,556
TRAVIS: There are five blocks on each side.

2920
03:31:10,556 --> 03:31:14,946
MATT: -- and then vanishes down the hallway. So
it's now just you guys in this hallway.

2921
03:31:14,946 --> 03:31:16,031
LAURA: Did you give him the password?

2922
03:31:16,031 --> 03:31:17,346
TALIESIN: I have not given him the password yet.

2923
03:31:17,346 --> 03:31:20,030
MATT: No, because he already opened the box.

2924
03:31:20,030 --> 03:31:24,544
LIAM: Daxio, we've got your papers, c'mon.

2925
03:31:24,544 --> 03:31:30,602
MATT: I just, because I foresee something possibly
happening here.

2926
03:31:30,602 --> 03:31:32,892
LAURA: I think we were saying the password
made it work.

2927
03:31:32,892 --> 03:31:36,554
TRAVIS: I think he knows we're full of shit.

2928
03:31:36,554 --> 03:31:39,637
LAURA: I think he knows it's super powerful magic
anyway and he doesn't give a shit and he's taking

2929
03:31:39,637 --> 03:31:40,718
it anyway.

2930
03:31:40,718 --> 03:31:42,736
TALIESIN: That's good, because man, this was some
bullshit.

2931
03:31:42,736 --> 03:31:57,834
MATT: So. All right. So, you guys are all gathered
in this hallway. Who is standing where?

2932
03:31:57,834 --> 03:32:01,865
TALIESIN: Where did he leave from?

2933
03:32:01,865 --> 03:32:06,445
MATT: You guys entered this direction and they
scattered this way.

2934
03:32:06,445 --> 03:32:12,433
LIAM: I'm going to lock eyes with Grog and motion him
towards one side of the door, and I'm gonna take

2935
03:32:12,433 --> 03:32:13,650
the other.

2936
03:32:13,650 --> 03:32:17,307
LAURA: Can you Wall of Stone the other side of the
hallway? Just to block them from coming down that

2937
03:32:17,307 --> 03:32:21,869
hallway again. Can you block, Wall of Stone that
other side?

2938
03:32:21,869 --> 03:32:26,071
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and block in the
entryway for good measure.

2939
03:32:26,071 --> 03:32:27,116
MATT: Right here?

2940
03:32:27,116 --> 03:32:29,399
LAURA: I thought the one he left through.

2941
03:32:29,399 --> 03:32:32,817
MATT: Okay, they left this way. Okay, so you wall
this off?

2942
03:32:32,817 --> 03:32:35,658
MARISHA: Yeah. Why not?

2943
03:32:35,658 --> 03:32:40,298
MATT: There is now a wall of stone in the middle
of that hallway.

2944
03:32:40,298 --> 03:32:43,315
SAM: Hope we don't have to leave that way, but she
can just dispel it.

2945
03:32:43,315 --> 03:32:44,955
MARISHA: I mean, we can get it out.

2946
03:32:44,955 --> 03:32:49,369
MATT: All right, so, who is standing where? Is
there any particular placement you guys wish to--

2947
03:32:49,369 --> 03:32:50,966
TRAVIS: Vax and I are on either side of the door.

2948
03:32:50,966 --> 03:32:54,058
MATT: All right, so you guys are here. All right.

2949
03:32:54,058 --> 03:32:57,999
MARISHA: So is this leading into something crazy?

2950
03:32:57,999 --> 03:32:59,434
LAURA: Into his cell.

2951
03:32:59,434 --> 03:33:01,396
MARISHA: Into a labyrinth? Or just his cell?

2952
03:33:01,396 --> 03:33:02,896
MATT: As far so you know, a cell.

2953
03:33:02,896 --> 03:33:04,658
MARISHA: As far as we know, just a cell.

2954
03:33:04,658 --> 03:33:11,630
LAURA: He just completely took an expensive thing
and left us to rot, pretty much, I think.

2955
03:33:11,630 --> 03:33:13,491
MATT: Anyone else want to change this
arrangement?

2956
03:33:13,491 --> 03:33:21,990
TRAVIS: We are in a giant death cluster. How about
we spread out a touch? Like two people to a door

2957
03:33:21,990 --> 03:33:23,205
in that hallway.

2958
03:33:23,205 --> 03:33:25,547
SAM: All right, I'll take the other door.

2959
03:33:25,547 --> 03:33:27,124
TALIESIN: I'll take the other door.

2960
03:33:27,124 --> 03:33:30,974
LAURA: I'll go down with Scanlan on the other one
so I can ranged attack--

2961
03:33:30,974 --> 03:33:36,153
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, if he took out a magical
spectacle and knows we're full of shit, we're all

2962
03:33:36,153 --> 03:33:37,125
gonna die.

2963
03:33:37,125 --> 03:33:42,615
LAURA: I'm gonna stand with my back against the
wall that she's built up. Like that, yeah.

2964
03:33:42,615 --> 03:33:45,487
MARISHA: Did half-orc dude say he was just in this
cell? That's all he said?

2965
03:33:45,487 --> 03:33:46,953
LAURA: Yeah.

2966
03:33:46,953 --> 03:33:49,681
MATT: They essentially unlocked the cell, they're
walking away, they're turning their heads and

2967
03:33:49,681 --> 03:33:51,206
letting you do what you want.

2968
03:33:51,206 --> 03:33:52,923
ASHLEY: How do we know that's the one that he's
in?

2969
03:33:52,923 --> 03:33:53,780
LIAM: We don't.

2970
03:33:53,780 --> 03:33:54,770
TALIESIN: Let's find out.

2971
03:33:54,770 --> 03:33:56,849
SAM: Why don't you go in and kill some shit?

2972
03:33:56,849 --> 03:33:58,633
MATT: Everyone's good with this arrangement?

2973
03:33:58,633 --> 03:34:01,386
MARISHA: Is there any other entrances or anything
else around?

2974
03:34:01,386 --> 03:34:03,537
MATT: There's just this door and this door and
they're both currently--

2975
03:34:03,537 --> 03:34:05,267
MARISHA: Fine, go for it.

2976
03:34:05,267 --> 03:34:06,805
LIAM: And I called out already.

2977
03:34:06,805 --> 03:34:08,082
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

2978
03:34:08,082 --> 03:34:14,976
MATT: Okay. Let us go ahead for the sake of this,
roll initiative depending on what happens going

2979
03:34:14,976 --> 03:34:16,624
forward just so we have that.

2980
03:34:16,624 --> 03:34:18,589
SAM: Just in case, eh?

2981
03:34:18,589 --> 03:34:25,185
TRAVIS: Just because I have a fear of construction
paper. Advantage.

2982
03:34:25,185 --> 03:34:28,826
TALIESIN: What did construction paper do to you?

2983
03:34:28,826 --> 03:34:32,121
TRAVIS: What did it not do?

2984
03:34:32,121 --> 03:34:34,773
MATT: All right so. 25 to 20?

2985
03:34:34,773 --> 03:34:35,646
LIAM: 25.

2986
03:34:35,646 --> 03:34:36,639
TALIESIN: 25.

2987
03:34:36,639 --> 03:34:37,821
LAURA: 26.

2988
03:34:37,821 --> 03:34:43,301
MATT: 20 to 15?

2989
03:34:43,301 --> 03:34:44,876
TRAVIS: 17.

2990
03:34:44,876 --> 03:34:52,634
MATT: 15 to ten?

2991
03:34:52,647 --> 03:34:53,827
MARISHA: 14.

2992
03:34:53,827 --> 03:34:54,990
SAM: 14.

2993
03:34:54,990 --> 03:35:00,383
MATT: And what did Ashley get?

2994
03:35:00,383 --> 03:35:02,354
TRAVIS: Nine. Of course.

2995
03:35:02,354 --> 03:35:04,762
MATT: Okay. I would expect nothing less.

2996
03:35:04,762 --> 03:35:09,310
TALIESIN: I like to think that she looks both ways
before attacking just to see--

2997
03:35:09,310 --> 03:35:11,489
MATT: All right, so. You rage.

2998
03:35:11,489 --> 03:35:12,781
TRAVIS: I rage.

2999
03:35:12,781 --> 03:35:14,987
MATT: Who's doing what now?

3000
03:35:14,987 --> 03:35:16,999
MARISSA: Vax is our point man.

3001
03:35:16,999 --> 03:35:22,424
LIAM: We're both at the door and I called out, so
I guess we'll wait a moment to see if he'll--

3002
03:35:22,424 --> 03:35:25,438
MATT: A moment passes.

3003
03:35:25,438 --> 03:35:28,272
TRAVIS: You want to check? I can open the door.

3004
03:35:28,272 --> 03:35:33,034
LIAM: Well, I already went stealth earlier too, I
got a 25 on the stealth check. I can go again if

3005
03:35:33,034 --> 03:35:34,087
you want.

3006
03:35:34,087 --> 03:35:35,992
MATT: Do you want to try and stealth in the room?

3007
03:35:35,992 --> 03:35:38,900
LIAM: If we wait like 30 seconds and nothing
happens.

3008
03:35:38,900 --> 03:35:41,336
MATT: Nothing happens, yeah. Okay, make another
stealth check.

3009
03:35:41,336 --> 03:35:48,553
LIAM: No. 21. I'm doing nothing, I'm just standing
in place.

3010
03:35:48,553 --> 03:35:51,758
TRAVIS: He thinks you're going in.

3011
03:35:51,758 --> 03:35:57,506
MATT: So, as you push in the doorway, quietly, you
see, for a moment inside, you can see there's a

3012
03:35:57,506 --> 03:36:01,816
little bit of light from overheard in the room
that lights it up. You see in the distance what

3013
03:36:01,816 --> 03:36:08,609
looks to be a latrine in the far corner, and as
soon as you peek in the doorway, you glance out

3014
03:36:08,609 --> 03:36:14,528
the side of your eyeline, and you immediately see
a figure, and a flash of metal.

3015
03:36:14,528 --> 03:36:18,284
LIAM: Okay, I'll use Uncanny Dodge, then.

3016
03:36:18,284 --> 03:36:20,584
MATT: All right.

3017
03:36:20,584 --> 03:36:23,294
LIAM: Unless it's an area effect. If it's an area
effect I'll use Evasion.

3018
03:36:23,294 --> 03:36:29,648
MATT: No, it is a direct attack, as a giant
metallic glaive comes down to you. That is going

3019
03:36:29,648 --> 03:36:31,889
to be a 19 to hit.

3020
03:36:31,889 --> 03:36:35,838
LIAM: That hits.

3021
03:36:35,838 --> 03:36:41,206
MATT: All right. That is 18 points of piercing.
I'm sorry, slashing damage.

3022
03:36:41,206 --> 03:36:43,378
LIAM: Nine points with the Uncanny Dodge.

3023
03:36:43,378 --> 03:36:52,044
MATT: Okay. At this point now you reveal the
interior, and right here at the door, you see

3024
03:36:52,044 --> 03:36:58,724
there, standing, Daxio right before you. Armored
up, sweat on the brow, holding what looks to be a

3025
03:36:58,724 --> 03:37:05,929
large glaive, a halberd-type weapon with a giant
bladed tip, which (whack) strikes you and gets

3026
03:37:05,929 --> 03:37:11,778
back in defensive position. "You! I knew
it."

3027
03:37:11,778 --> 03:37:13,495
LAURA: Isn't he old?

3028
03:37:13,495 --> 03:37:16,271
MATT: Daxio's a mature elf.

3029
03:37:16,271 --> 03:37:23,488
LIAM: Can I move and then hold my turn? Can I move
at all? Hold the actions?

3030
03:37:23,488 --> 03:37:26,544
MATT: You've moved in, you could ready your action
if you'd like.

3031
03:37:26,544 --> 03:37:29,179
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, could I just
use my movement and then wait?

3032
03:37:29,179 --> 03:37:30,585
MATT: You could if you'd like.

3033
03:37:30,585 --> 03:37:34,096
LIAM: Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going
to circle around and I'm never going to leave him.

3034
03:37:34,096 --> 03:37:37,575
I'm going to go all the way around, circle him,
and then wait. And then my trigger is when Grog

3035
03:37:37,575 --> 03:37:39,263
steps up to him.

3036
03:37:39,263 --> 03:37:43,291
MATT: You can't move through other creatures. In
this place and area--

3037
03:37:43,291 --> 03:37:44,487
LIAM: Oh, I can't go around him?

3038
03:37:44,487 --> 03:37:49,029
MATT: No, he has you blocked off at the doorway,
and has like squared off with you right now, with

3039
03:37:49,029 --> 03:37:50,272
the glaive.

3040
03:37:50,272 --> 03:37:52,124
LIAM: Is Grog considered five feet away from him?

3041
03:37:52,124 --> 03:37:53,706
MATT: Grog is considered five feet away from you,
yes.

3042
03:37:53,706 --> 03:37:55,798
LIAM: Oh. Then I'm going to sneak attack him.

3043
03:37:55,798 --> 03:37:57,763
MATT: Not five feet away from him.

3044
03:37:57,763 --> 03:37:58,725
LIAM: From me?

3045
03:37:58,725 --> 03:38:03,327
MATT: In order to sneak attack a creature, you
have to have an ally adjacent to the enemy, not to

3046
03:38:03,327 --> 03:38:06,944
you. The idea is, they're being harried by two
different points and can't form a good defense

3047
03:38:06,944 --> 03:38:13,680
LIAM: Okay, all right. Then I'm going to use
Disengage, I'm going to step five feet back. I'm

3048
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:20,475
going to use one action to click my Boots of
Haste. And then can I attack, because the boots

3049
03:38:20,475 --> 03:38:23,750
are on, after that? Then I'll throw a dagger at
him.

3050
03:38:23,750 --> 03:38:25,018
MATT: Okay.

3051
03:38:25,018 --> 03:38:29,237
LIAM: That is a 24.

3052
03:38:29,237 --> 03:38:31,013
MATT: 24 does hit.

3053
03:38:31,013 --> 03:38:35,425
LIAM: All right. 11 from the Keen Dagger.

3054
03:38:35,425 --> 03:38:37,910
MATT: All right. Cool.

3055
03:38:37,910 --> 03:38:44,263
MATT: All right. We have now officially, as of
this moment, entered combat. You technically would

3056
03:38:44,263 --> 03:38:49,285
be next in the initiative round at this point, but
you're holding your action until-- what are you

3057
03:38:49,285 --> 03:38:50,756
holding your action until?

3058
03:38:50,756 --> 03:38:54,080
LIAM: I was only going to do that if you told me that I
could move around him, now that I know that I can't--

3059
03:38:54,080 --> 03:39:00,123
MATT: All right, you did that, okay. Okay, never
mind. Gotcha. All right, cool. So that will be, in

3060
03:39:00,123 --> 03:39:05,554
theory, the first opening to the battle. Now we
start the initiative order. All right. So now

3061
03:39:05,554 --> 03:39:07,419
we're starting off. Vex, you're up first.

3062
03:39:07,419 --> 03:39:16,075
LAURA: I call out: Daxio, don't be a moron. Step
outside and lower your weapon, you're surrounded.

3063
03:39:16,075 --> 03:39:19,525
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3064
03:39:19,525 --> 03:39:23,375
SAM: You were using your deep voice, so you
could--

3065
03:39:23,375 --> 03:39:24,730
LAURA: My deep voice!

3066
03:39:24,730 --> 03:39:26,243
SAM: You could get advantage.

3067
03:39:26,243 --> 03:39:28,650
LAURA: To intimidate him more. 13.

3068
03:39:28,650 --> 03:39:33,145
MATT: 13. Okay. You shout it out, and it echoes
through the hallway. Who knows if it's landed or

3069
03:39:33,145 --> 03:39:35,455
had an effect, you can't see him from your current
perspective.

3070
03:39:35,455 --> 03:39:38,534
LAURA: Should I walk forward or should I keep--

3071
03:39:38,534 --> 03:39:42,072
TRAVIS: He's in there by himself, and no other
are enemies.

3072
03:39:42,072 --> 03:39:44,088
LAURA: I mean, as far as we know.

3073
03:39:44,088 --> 03:39:46,398
SAM; Why don't you check the other door?

3074
03:39:46,398 --> 03:39:49,371
LIAM: Whoever's in there is locked in there.

3075
03:39:49,371 --> 03:39:52,121
LAURA: Yeah. I'm just going to-- I'm going to stay
where I am, I guess.

3076
03:39:52,121 --> 03:39:56,472
MATT: All righty. So you stay there. Next up is
Vax and Percy.

3077
03:39:56,472 --> 03:40:02,687
LIAM: I'm going to disengage and back up against
the back wall--

3078
03:40:02,687 --> 03:40:03,980
MATT: You've already disengaged.

3079
03:40:03,980 --> 03:40:06,062
LIAM: Already have? All right, so I'm going to
back up and hold.

3080
03:40:06,062 --> 03:40:14,955
MATT: Okay. So you back up-- You notice at this
point, as you step five feet back that that weapon

3081
03:40:14,955 --> 03:40:20,809
he's carrying is pretty long and has a pretty
decent reach. You may have to disengage to get out

3082
03:40:20,809 --> 03:40:22,444
of there without taking another strike.

3083
03:40:22,444 --> 03:40:25,751
LIAM: But if I were to go left or right, would I
be out of range of hitting him because of the

3084
03:40:25,751 --> 03:40:26,827
doorway?

3085
03:40:26,827 --> 03:40:28,435
MATT: You would be over here, probably, yeah.

3086
03:40:28,435 --> 03:40:32,142
LIAM: So if I move sideways either way I can't hit
him?

3087
03:40:32,142 --> 03:40:33,312
MATT: Correct.

3088
03:40:33,312 --> 03:40:36,751
LIAM: So I'm not going to do that. I'm going to
just step back against the back wall and hold.

3089
03:40:36,751 --> 03:40:39,518
MATT: Are you using your disengage action or not?

3090
03:40:39,518 --> 03:40:42,303
LIAM: Was I within five feet of him?

3091
03:40:42,303 --> 03:40:44,432
Yes, I'm going to use disengage.

3092
03:40:44,432 --> 03:40:47,316
MATT: Okay. So you use your bonus action to
disengage. Because you're not used to fighting

3093
03:40:47,316 --> 03:40:51,985
these long polearm weapons, as you begin to take
another step back, you realize he can actually hit

3094
03:40:51,985 --> 03:40:53,362
you from further away than you expect.

3095
03:40:53,362 --> 03:40:55,532
LAURA: Oh! Can I have used my bonus action to
hide?

3096
03:40:55,532 --> 03:40:58,904
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll stealth. All right,
and now you're going to go ahead and--

3097
03:40:58,904 --> 03:41:00,453
LAURA: Natural 20.

3098
03:41:00,453 --> 03:41:05,499
MATT: Okay. You vanish. Hold until what? What do
you want to be the trigger?

3099
03:41:05,499 --> 03:41:06,898
LIAM: Until Grog steps in.

3100
03:41:06,898 --> 03:41:09,967
MATT: Okay. All right, next up is Percy.

3101
03:41:09,967 --> 03:41:14,536
TALIESIN: Is there a grille on that door? Any
kind of--

3102
03:41:14,536 --> 03:41:16,267
MATT: No, it is a solid door.

3103
03:41:16,267 --> 03:41:17,662
TALIESIN: It is a solid door.

3104
03:41:17,662 --> 03:41:19,069
MATT: It is currently open, but--

3105
03:41:19,069 --> 03:41:21,581
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I mean on the door that I'm next
to.

3106
03:41:21,581 --> 03:41:23,239
MATT: Oh, no, that is closed. That is a solid
door.

3107
03:41:23,239 --> 03:41:29,783
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold-- I'm going to stay
where I am and hold my action until I see somebody

3108
03:41:29,783 --> 03:41:31,369
I want to shoot in the hallway.

3109
03:41:31,369 --> 03:41:34,108
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right, that brings
us to Grog.

3110
03:41:34,108 --> 03:41:43,262
TRAVIS: I bellow out: you're in for the fight of
your life if you don't drop your polearm. The next

3111
03:41:43,262 --> 03:41:46,452
thing that hits the ground if you don't will be
your skull.

3112
03:41:46,452 --> 03:41:50,516
MATT: Are you using your action to intimidate?

3113
03:41:50,516 --> 03:41:52,813
TRAVIS: Yes.

3114
03:41:52,813 --> 03:41:54,725
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an intimidate check.

3115
03:41:54,725 --> 03:41:56,878
SAM: Don't you have some sort of intimidate
thing?

3116
03:41:56,878 --> 03:42:02,498
MATT: He's not in a frenzied rage, though.

3117
03:42:02,498 --> 03:42:09,700
TRAVIS: No, but I'll take Craven Edge out and
leave him unsheathed, which gives me an advantage

3118
03:42:09,700 --> 03:42:11,333
on intimidation checks.

3119
03:42:11,333 --> 03:42:19,480
17.

3120
03:42:19,480 --> 03:42:26,813
MATT: 17. Okay. You can see now, with the blade
forward, sweat dripping down his face, this look

3121
03:42:26,813 --> 03:42:34,471
of a cornered animal, and as the sword comes out
with a ringing sound in the air, the shadows

3122
03:42:34,471 --> 03:42:44,123
coalesce around the black obsidian blade. He gives
you a look and he's questioning his current

3123
03:42:44,123 --> 03:42:46,412
circumstance, but seems to be holding firm.

3124
03:42:46,412 --> 03:42:49,435
TRAVIS: What do I have left of my turn? Anything?

3125
03:42:49,435 --> 03:42:51,950
MATT: You have your bonus action and your move.

3126
03:42:51,950 --> 03:42:59,141
TRAVIS: Bonus action. Bonus action. What's a bonus
action? What can I do?

3127
03:42:59,141 --> 03:43:01,319
LAURA: I don't know what you can do.

3128
03:43:01,319 --> 03:43:03,835
MATT: If you're in frenzied rage it would be
another attack, but--

3129
03:43:03,835 --> 03:43:14,637
TRAVIS: No, that makes me tired as shit. No, I
won't do anything else.

3130
03:43:14,637 --> 03:43:25,600
MATT: Okay, you stay there? All righty. Now being
his turn, Daxio is just going to curve around the

3131
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:31,734
side, looking at you with the glaive in position,
responding to your intimidating act. Takes the

3132
03:43:31,734 --> 03:43:41,124
blade and swirls it around and goes for your legs.
So, that's going to be a 21 to hit.

3133
03:43:41,124 --> 03:43:42,409
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

3134
03:43:42,409 --> 03:43:49,937
MATT: All righty. This is going to be, as the
glaive sweeps under your legs, trying to gash

3135
03:43:49,937 --> 03:43:54,034
across, that's eight points of slashing damage.

3136
03:43:54,034 --> 03:43:55,580
TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.

3137
03:43:55,580 --> 03:44:00,936
MATT: Plus an additional five points from his
superiority die.

3138
03:44:00,936 --> 03:44:02,454
TRAVIS: From his what?

3139
03:44:02,454 --> 03:44:03,514
SAM: Superiority.

3140
03:44:03,514 --> 03:44:06,308
MATT: He's attempting to trip you. Go ahead and
make a strength saving throw.

3141
03:44:06,308 --> 03:44:09,009
TRAVIS: Do I have--

3142
03:44:09,009 --> 03:44:14,434
MATT: Ability checks, not your saving throws.

3143
03:44:14,434 --> 03:44:17,495
TRAVIS: Strength checks and strength saving
throws, advantage.

3144
03:44:17,495 --> 03:44:18,455
MATT: Is that what it says?

3145
03:44:18,455 --> 03:44:20,473
TRAVIS: Yeah. Advantage on all strength checks and
strength saving throws.

3146
03:44:20,473 --> 03:44:21,930
MATT: Then yeah, you would have advantage on this.

3147
03:44:21,930 --> 03:44:29,277
TRAVIS: Haha. 26.

3148
03:44:29,277 --> 03:44:35,525
MATT: 26. You stand firm in your position. The
blade strikes and gashes open a part of your shin,

3149
03:44:35,525 --> 03:44:39,543
but you just hold your place there, leaning
against the wall for support. Doesn't affect you.

3150
03:44:39,543 --> 03:44:42,307
TRAVIS: So 13 total halved, so seven?

3151
03:44:42,307 --> 03:44:54,366
MATT: Mm-hm. Next is going to-- You know what,
he's going to go ahead and attempt to strike you

3152
03:44:54,366 --> 03:45:02,544
two more times. That is going to be a 16 to hit?

3153
03:45:02,544 --> 03:45:03,997
TRAVIS: Misses.

3154
03:45:03,997 --> 03:45:09,628
MATT: And this one is going to take a minus five
on that one. That was a-- Oh, okay. All right,

3155
03:45:09,628 --> 03:45:13,003
that's 24.

3156
03:45:13,003 --> 03:45:14,055
TRAVIS: That'll hit.

3157
03:45:14,055 --> 03:45:21,244
MATT: All right. This is going to be a Great
Weapon Master strike. So this is 20 points of

3158
03:45:21,325 --> 03:45:28,787
slashing damage, halved to ten. And is going to
hold firm in his current position, daring anyone

3159
03:45:28,787 --> 03:45:34,156
to come near, yeah. Holding this pincher point.
Keyleth, you're up.

3160
03:45:34,156 --> 03:45:40,654
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to peek around Grog, and
try and cast Hold Person on him.

3161
03:45:40,654 --> 03:45:44,528
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on that?

3162
03:45:44,528 --> 03:45:48,177
MARISHA: 18. Just my spell DC, right?

3163
03:45:48,177 --> 03:45:55,078
MATT: Okay. Well, that is 17. However, he is going
to use Indomitable to reroll a saving throw.

3164
03:45:55,078 --> 03:45:56,266
MARISHA: Aw.

3165
03:45:56,266 --> 03:46:03,071
MATT: That is going to be a 20. So as you finish
the spell, you can see his head beginning to be

3166
03:46:03,071 --> 03:46:08,515
affected and he shrugs it off through sheer force
of will. Anything else you want to do on your turn?

3167
03:46:08,515 --> 03:46:10,448
TALIESIN: This guy's annoying.

3168
03:46:10,448 --> 03:46:20,372
MARISHA: No. Ah! Yes!

3169
03:46:20,372 --> 03:46:23,360
MATT: Okay. That ends Keyleth's turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

3170
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:33,055
MARISHA: I just said yes. No, wait, I don't have
it, I don't have it. Nope. Never mind. No! Go.

3171
03:46:33,055 --> 03:46:34,502
MATT: Scanlan, what are you doing?

3172
03:46:34,502 --> 03:46:36,865
SAM: I can't see him yet or I can?

3173
03:46:36,865 --> 03:46:40,203
MATT: No, not right now. You just see this blade
going (whoosh whoosh) out the doorway.

3174
03:46:40,203 --> 03:46:43,016
SAM: And I saw Keyleth cast that spell, yeah?

3175
03:46:43,016 --> 03:46:44,044
MATT: Correct, yes.

3176
03:46:44,044 --> 03:46:49,962
SAM: I run up a little closer to be in visual
range, yeah?

3177
03:46:49,962 --> 03:46:51,323
MATT: There you can see him, yeah.

3178
03:46:51,323 --> 03:46:56,403
SAM: And I will do the same fucking thing. And
I'll cast Hold Person on him as well, with my Hand

3179
03:46:56,403 --> 03:46:58,518
Cone of Clarity.

3180
03:46:58,518 --> 03:47:00,818
MATT: Your hand cone. That is a natural one.

3181
03:47:00,818 --> 03:47:02,355
(cheering)

3182
03:47:02,355 --> 03:47:05,228
MATT: He's going to use his other use of
Indomitable to attempt to reroll that.

3183
03:47:05,228 --> 03:47:06,274
SAM: He has two?!

3184
03:47:06,274 --> 03:47:10,600
MATT: Two, but this is his last one. That brings
him to a 19.

3185
03:47:10,600 --> 03:47:11,755
SAM: 19.

3186
03:47:11,755 --> 03:47:13,234
MATT: Just beats your DC.

3187
03:47:13,234 --> 03:47:14,858
MARISHA: He has to make a wisdom saving throw.

3188
03:47:14,858 --> 03:47:15,815
MATT: Yeah.

3189
03:47:15,815 --> 03:47:18,976
MARISHA: Oh, is that what he was doing against my
spell save? Is that what it is?

3190
03:47:18,976 --> 03:47:20,204
SAM: Damn.

3191
03:47:20,204 --> 03:47:28,729
MATT: Wait, no. That is a 17. Sorry, I misdid the
math. So it does go through him. So as you finish

3192
03:47:28,729 --> 03:47:36,865
the Hold Person, he (groans) locks up into place,
tense, his eyes darting around with an angry fury.

3193
03:47:36,865 --> 03:47:39,611
Anything else you want to do?

3194
03:47:39,611 --> 03:47:42,545
SAM: I will, with my bonus, can I talk to him?

3195
03:47:42,545 --> 03:47:43,569
MATT: Yeah.

3196
03:47:43,569 --> 03:47:53,318
SAM: I will say: hey man! Just give up already.
Come on! Come on! That's my intimidation.

3197
03:47:53,318 --> 03:47:54,957
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

3198
03:47:54,957 --> 03:47:59,524
SAM: 21.

3199
03:47:59,524 --> 03:48:07,471
MATT: 21. He seems visibly shaken by the presence
of the two of you and the fact that he can't move

3200
03:48:07,471 --> 03:48:11,886
right now. That's the best I can give you at the
moment.

3201
03:48:11,886 --> 03:48:15,967
LAURA: Can we take his weapon from him since he
can't move?

3202
03:48:15,967 --> 03:48:22,079
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, I believe.
Pike.

3203
03:48:22,079 --> 03:48:29,561
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I intimidate him to give me his
weapon?

3204
03:48:29,561 --> 03:48:30,896
SAM: He can't move.

3205
03:48:30,896 --> 03:48:34,580
ASHLEY: He can't move? Can I go up and try to
take his weapon?

3206
03:48:34,580 --> 03:48:41,341
MATT: If you want to. One, two, three, four, five.
So you step up into the hallway. And you walk up

3207
03:48:41,341 --> 03:48:48,070
to him and he's looking at you, sweat dripping
down his face, hair matted across the side of his chin.

3208
03:48:48,070 --> 03:48:49,003
LAURA: Do it, Pike!

3209
03:48:49,003 --> 03:48:49,988
MARISHA: Do it.

3210
03:48:49,988 --> 03:48:51,281
MATT: What are you doing?

3211
03:48:51,281 --> 03:48:55,327
ASHLEY: Please give me your weapon.

3212
03:48:55,327 --> 03:48:56,943
(laughter)

3213
03:48:56,943 --> 03:48:58,416
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

3214
03:48:58,416 --> 03:49:00,596
SAM: Get more flies with honey.

3215
03:49:00,596 --> 03:49:08,435
ASHLEY: Fuck. Well, it's probably not going to
work with a four.

3216
03:49:08,435 --> 03:49:17,892
MATT: With a four? The eyes-- Though frozen, he
still manages to roll his eyes, as the armored

3217
03:49:17,892 --> 03:49:22,980
gnome walks up and requests his weapon, and is no
longer paying attention.

3218
03:49:22,980 --> 03:49:25,661
ASHLEY: Can I just take it from him?

3219
03:49:25,661 --> 03:49:31,574
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check. Just
roll and add your strength modifier.

3220
03:49:31,574 --> 03:49:35,485
LAURA: That's good.

3221
03:49:35,485 --> 03:49:38,912
ASHLEY: 18.

3222
03:49:38,912 --> 03:49:42,868
LAURA: Oh wait, it might be higher than that. No.

3223
03:49:42,868 --> 03:49:44,026
ASHLEY: 18?

3224
03:49:44,026 --> 03:49:48,237
MATT: 18. You go and grab and all the muscles
tensed up, it's like a vice grip, and as you pull

3225
03:49:48,237 --> 03:49:54,972
and pull and pull, to no avail. You're unable to
wrestle it from his grasp. That ends your turn.

3226
03:49:54,972 --> 03:49:56,339
Back up. Vex.

3227
03:49:56,339 --> 03:50:01,041
LAURA: All right. I guess I walk-- Look at us all
bunched up in this little hall.

3228
03:50:01,041 --> 03:50:03,205
MATT: Yeah. This is a bad circumstance for a
party.

3229
03:50:03,205 --> 03:50:10,151
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going
to just call out: you're being really stupid,

3230
03:50:10,151 --> 03:50:19,919
obviously. You are outnumbered. You are frozen.
You should probably just, you know, give up.

3231
03:50:19,919 --> 03:50:22,280
ASHLEY: You have him held?

3232
03:50:22,280 --> 03:50:27,680
SAM: He's held. And also, we probably can't tell
if he's giving up because he probably can't talk.

3233
03:50:27,680 --> 03:50:37,760
LAURA: Okay, until Grog. I want to hold my action
until Grog gets him to move. Until he moves out of--

3234
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:39,817
MATT: Okay. What action do you want to hold? What
are you going to do?

3235
03:50:39,817 --> 03:50:41,395
LAURA: Do I have to say what I'm going to--

3236
03:50:41,395 --> 03:50:43,628
MATT: I want to know what you're readying,
essentially.

3237
03:50:43,628 --> 03:50:48,281
LAURA: I want to, if anything attacks us, I want
to be able to attack it.

3238
03:50:48,281 --> 03:50:52,850
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Same, Percy? All right.
Then Vax, same?

3239
03:50:52,850 --> 03:50:56,102
LIAM: I'm going to wait to see what Grog does. As
soon as Grog's done, I'm throwing.

3240
03:50:56,102 --> 03:50:57,372
MATT: Grog, what are you doing?

3241
03:50:57,372 --> 03:50:59,963
TRAVIS: Can I squeeze by Pike, or do I need to
pick her up and move her out of the way?

3242
03:50:59,963 --> 03:51:05,524
MATT: Technically, being held doesn't threaten the
square and you can probably walk around Pike, so

3243
03:51:05,524 --> 03:51:11,407
you can get into the room. I'd say right now,
because he can't really defend it or keep you at

3244
03:51:11,407 --> 03:51:12,629
bay with his weapon.

3245
03:51:12,629 --> 03:51:18,190
TRAVIS: Walk, that's cute. I would like to run
past Pike and bear-form tackle him.

3246
03:51:18,190 --> 03:51:21,180
MATT: Okay! All right, so we're doing a full--

3247
03:51:21,180 --> 03:51:28,050
TRAVIS: Full shoulder in the gut, wrapping my arms
around his legs, picking him up and throwing him

3248
03:51:28,050 --> 03:51:29,051
on the ground.

3249
03:51:29,051 --> 03:51:30,621
LAURA: Don't you wish we had Trinket now?

3250
03:51:30,621 --> 03:51:33,793
SAM: Oh, it's like football drills? Running into
a-- What are those things called?

3251
03:51:33,793 --> 03:51:36,516
TRAVIS: Guy's standing up and you're just driving
into him with your whole body mass.

3252
03:51:36,516 --> 03:51:38,916
LIAM: Why do we need Trinket? We have a small
giant.

3253
03:51:38,916 --> 03:51:44,868
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an athletics
check.

3254
03:51:44,868 --> 03:51:52,185
TRAVIS: Okay. Yes! 19.

3255
03:51:52,185 --> 03:51:58,520
MATT: 19? That's fine. He can't even defend at
this point. So you push him back five feet and you

3256
03:51:58,520 --> 03:52:02,766
manage to push your way into this and shove him
further into the room.

3257
03:52:02,766 --> 03:52:03,936
TRAVIS: But not to the ground?

3258
03:52:03,936 --> 03:52:07,735
MARISHA: He wanted to take him to the ground.

3259
03:52:07,735 --> 03:52:09,776
TRAVIS: Yeah, I wanted to tackle him and be on top
of him.

3260
03:52:09,776 --> 03:52:16,176
MATT: Yeah, you know what (impact sound), on the
ground and you are right over, lording the space.

3261
03:52:16,176 --> 03:52:19,523
Okay. That all you're going to do on your turn?

3262
03:52:19,523 --> 03:52:23,923
TRAVIS: I can't attack, right? That's all I got?

3263
03:52:23,923 --> 03:52:25,398
TALIESIN: You can move.

3264
03:52:25,398 --> 03:52:26,875
TRAVIS: No. I'll stay there.

3265
03:52:26,875 --> 03:52:31,928
LIAM: Are we able to tell from what Grog just did
what he does? Does he react, does he just go (grunts).

3266
03:52:31,928 --> 03:52:34,313
MATT: He just falls over, because he can't move
his muscles.

3267
03:52:34,313 --> 03:52:38,592
LAURA: Can we move his muscles or is he frozen?

3268
03:52:38,592 --> 03:52:41,261
SAM: You mean use him like Weekend at Bernie's?

3269
03:52:41,261 --> 03:52:45,118
LAURA: Can we handcuff him while he's frozen?

3270
03:52:45,118 --> 03:52:47,596
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say. Can we
tie him? Tie him up?

3271
03:52:47,596 --> 03:52:50,177
MATT: You can attempt to if you get to him on your
turn.

3272
03:52:50,177 --> 03:52:52,053
ASHLEY: Hog-tie him.

3273
03:52:52,053 --> 03:52:58,856
MATT: Grog, you finish your turn? Comes to Daxio's
turn. Daxio's attempting to resist. That's a

3274
03:52:58,856 --> 03:53:00,038
natural 20.

3275
03:53:00,038 --> 03:53:01,931
LAURA: Weren't you holding your turn until Grog
moved him?

3276
03:53:01,931 --> 03:53:06,233
LIAM: Until Grog did his thing. Yeah, but I wanted
to see what happened. So it would be after this.

3277
03:53:06,233 --> 03:53:14,400
MATT: Right. So as Daxio is on the ground, muscles
lax for a second and looks up at you and can't do

3278
03:53:14,400 --> 03:53:19,166
anything, because that was his turn, but is no
longer seemingly affected by the ability. And just

3279
03:53:19,166 --> 03:53:23,245
looks up at you with eyes flicking around with
thoughts and trying to formulate a plan here.

3280
03:53:23,245 --> 03:53:24,855
TRAVIS: Yeah, like what you see, don't you?

3281
03:53:24,855 --> 03:53:26,556
MATT: Vax, what did you want to do?

3282
03:53:26,556 --> 03:53:30,205
LIAM: All right. So I'm hasted, because I did the
boots, so I'm going to use Haste to climb through

3283
03:53:30,205 --> 03:53:39,209
my friends, over Pike, under Grog's legs, and I'm
going to-- I'm going to flip daggers over and I'm

3284
03:53:39,209 --> 03:53:43,652
going to bean this guy in the face a couple of
times. Should be a Sneak Attack the first time,

3285
03:53:43,652 --> 03:53:45,855
because of Grog being there.

3286
03:53:45,855 --> 03:53:47,009
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

3287
03:53:47,009 --> 03:53:50,698
LIAM: All right. That is 30.

3288
03:53:50,698 --> 03:53:57,485
MATT: 30? Landing on the opposite side of the
room. On the other side of Daxio. You jump off of

3289
03:53:57,485 --> 03:53:59,718
Grog's back, land, and go for your attack.

3290
03:53:59,718 --> 03:54:01,753
LIAM: All right. I'm going to blunt-edge him three
times.

3291
03:54:01,753 --> 03:54:05,823
MATT: You have advantage on these attacks, because
he's currently prone on the ground.

3292
03:54:05,823 --> 03:54:12,052
LIAM: So the first one is a natural 20. That's
also sneak attack, so that doesn't get quadrupled,

3293
03:54:12,052 --> 03:54:15,719
does it? It's already doubled from sneak attack.

3294
03:54:15,719 --> 03:54:20,618
MATT: Correct. Well, no, no. It's doubled because
it's a critical hit. That's all.

3295
03:54:20,618 --> 03:54:22,868
LAURA: Oh right. Sneak Attack you just get the
additional six, remember?

3296
03:54:22,868 --> 03:54:32,200
LIAM: Yeah. Okay. So-- And then the second one is
a 23.

3297
03:54:32,200 --> 03:54:34,015
MATT: 23? Both hit.

3298
03:54:34,015 --> 03:54:38,434
LIAM: Okay. And did I use all my movement to climb
through the scrum or do I have my third attack?

3299
03:54:38,434 --> 03:54:43,377
MATT: The movement wouldn't affect your attack at
all. Your movement is just your movement action.

3300
03:54:43,377 --> 03:54:44,606
LIAM: So I do have a third attack, then?

3301
03:54:44,606 --> 03:54:45,721
MATT: You would in theory, yes.

3302
03:54:45,721 --> 03:54:50,613
LIAM: Okay, so that's 17.

3303
03:54:50,613 --> 03:54:52,283
MATT: 17 does hit, yes.

3304
03:54:52,283 --> 03:54:56,519
LIAM: Okay. So the first one, blunt, using the
end, is--

3305
03:54:56,519 --> 03:54:59,212
LAURA: And then add your six.

3306
03:54:59,212 --> 03:55:07,468
LIAM: 11. Two, three, seven, ten, 15, 19.

3307
03:55:07,468 --> 03:55:10,064
MATT: 19 times two.

3308
03:55:10,064 --> 03:55:15,253
LIAM: 19 times two, right, is 38. Plus the seven,
so 46 for the first.

3309
03:55:15,253 --> 03:55:16,665
MATT: 46 points of damage.

3310
03:55:16,665 --> 03:55:24,323
LIAM: That's blunt, though. And two plus six is
eight on the second. And seven on the third.

3311
03:55:24,323 --> 03:55:29,295
MATT: All right, got it. So as you slam the
daggers into each side of his head, you can see,

3312
03:55:29,295 --> 03:55:34,546
cracking the side of the temple, blood beginning
to pour out the side of where the impact hit. He's

3313
03:55:34,546 --> 03:55:40,763
staggered momentarily from the impact, but after
the third strike hit, manages to bring the glaive

3314
03:55:40,763 --> 03:55:48,768
up to try and defend himself at this point. That
would be it. That ends your turn, that brings us--

3315
03:55:48,768 --> 03:55:51,713
LIAM: Did I use all my movement to get there. All
of it?

3316
03:55:51,713 --> 03:55:56,618
MATT: You could try and get away if you like. With
Haste you would have more movement, yeah.

3317
03:55:56,618 --> 03:56:01,509
LIAM: I'll take-- I'll go back ten feet. See what
happens. He's on his back, so he could probably

3318
03:56:01,509 --> 03:56:02,559
take a swing at me.

3319
03:56:02,559 --> 03:56:03,967
MATT: He tries to, but it's with disadvantage.

3320
03:56:03,967 --> 03:56:05,075
LIAM: All right. Yeah.

3321
03:56:05,075 --> 03:56:14,241
MATT: Yeah, rolled a two. That (whoomph) hits the
tile. All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

3322
03:56:14,241 --> 03:56:17,393
MARISHA: He's down on the ground?

3323
03:56:17,393 --> 03:56:18,357
MATT: Yeah.

3324
03:56:18,357 --> 03:56:19,499
LAURA: (gasps)

3325
03:56:19,499 --> 03:56:30,203
MARISHA: I was going to say, I can. Okay. Yeah,
I'll go ahead and vine him.

3326
03:56:30,203 --> 03:56:33,118
MATT: Grasping Vine? To where?

3327
03:56:33,118 --> 03:56:36,981
MARISHA: To-- Oh, right, because it's got to be
against a wall.

3328
03:56:36,981 --> 03:56:39,382
TRAVIS: It can't be the ground?

3329
03:56:39,382 --> 03:56:40,714
MARISHA: Can it be the ground?

3330
03:56:40,714 --> 03:56:42,270
MATT: It can probably be the ground if you want
to, yeah.

3331
03:56:42,270 --> 03:56:45,210
MARISHA: Yeah, can I essentially just entangle him
into the ground?

3332
03:56:45,210 --> 03:56:52,473
MATT: Sure. Let's give it a shot. So fourth level
Grasping Vine. All right. Dexterity saving throw,

3333
03:56:52,473 --> 03:57:04,857
which he has a disadvantage on. That is a failure.
All right. So is now (groans) and--

3334
03:57:04,857 --> 03:57:06,923
TALIESIN: While prone.

3335
03:57:06,923 --> 03:57:08,594
MARISHA: Yeah, he's down.

3336
03:57:08,594 --> 03:57:10,270
TALIESIN: That's hot.

3337
03:57:10,270 --> 03:57:15,768
MATT: So, technically, the spell doesn't grapple,
it just pulls things towards it. It just moves

3338
03:57:15,768 --> 03:57:16,769
things around the battlefield.

3339
03:57:16,769 --> 03:57:17,982
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right.

3340
03:57:17,982 --> 03:57:21,146
MATT: So the vine pulls him closer to the ground.

3341
03:57:21,146 --> 03:57:25,972
MARISHA: Can I do Entangle instead and just do a
concentrated Entangle?

3342
03:57:25,972 --> 03:57:32,214
MATT: Entangle would affect the entire floor of
that room. Yeah, Grasping Vine-- The vine's around

3343
03:57:32,214 --> 03:57:36,314
him, you don't know how much of an effect it'll
have when it comes to his turn, but you'll find out.

3344
03:57:36,314 --> 03:57:37,503
LAURA: It may help.

3345
03:57:37,503 --> 03:57:39,870
SAM: You did great!

3346
03:57:39,870 --> 03:57:44,093
MATT: It was also your bonus action. You can still
use your action to cast another second level if

3347
03:57:44,093 --> 03:57:45,311
you wanted to.

3348
03:57:45,311 --> 03:57:46,644
SAM: Cast Speak with Animals.

3349
03:57:46,644 --> 03:57:49,097
LAURA: Commune with Nature.

3350
03:57:49,097 --> 03:57:51,634
MARISHA: I mean, I can try and Hold Person him
again. Do we want to do that? I can Hold Person

3351
03:57:51,634 --> 03:57:52,635
him again.

3352
03:57:52,635 --> 03:57:54,356
SAM: We want to hear what he has to say, I think,
at this point.

3353
03:57:54,356 --> 03:58:04,715
MARISHA: Can I do a Druidcraft, Matt? A Druidcraft
where I druidcraft a vine around his ankles?

3354
03:58:04,715 --> 03:58:06,554
MATT: Sure.

3355
03:58:06,554 --> 03:58:07,822
MARISHA: Oh, okay, cool.

3356
03:58:07,822 --> 03:58:13,212
MATT: Out of the Grasping Vine, a little vine goes
around the legs. It's more of a grapevine. A

3357
03:58:13,212 --> 03:58:15,230
really pretty to grow plant life on.

3358
03:58:15,230 --> 03:58:17,167
MARISHA: A grapevine? Grapevines are pretty hard.

3359
03:58:17,167 --> 03:58:19,033
TRAVIS: A white or red grapevine?

3360
03:58:19,033 --> 03:58:21,098
MATT: A red one. Okay, Scanlan, you're up.

3361
03:58:21,098 --> 03:58:33,485
SAM: Me? Jesus. Hey! Hey, dude! Come on! Can you
give up, please? Can you please give up? I'm just

3362
03:58:33,485 --> 03:58:35,064
going to intimidate him again.

3363
03:58:35,064 --> 03:58:38,059
MATT: Okay. Roll an intimidation check.

3364
03:58:38,059 --> 03:58:40,223
LAURA: Come on! Roll so high.

3365
03:58:40,223 --> 03:58:52,364
SAM: Ah, that was a dead roll. That was the same
roll, but not wonky. This is intimidate? 22.

3366
03:58:52,364 --> 03:59:01,159
MATT: Okay. You get the sense now that these
rounds of perpetual pressuring Daxio and now

3367
03:59:01,159 --> 03:59:08,206
recovering his position in this fight and you guys
have stepped into this room with him, he's become

3368
03:59:08,206 --> 03:59:14,881
less of a sensible individual and more of a
desperate man lashing out as a last stand. And

3369
03:59:14,881 --> 03:59:18,603
your intimidation shouts are falling upon deaf
ears.

3370
03:59:18,603 --> 03:59:20,348
SAM: Okay.

3371
03:59:20,348 --> 03:59:22,416
MATT: Does that end your turn?

3372
03:59:22,416 --> 03:59:23,706
SAM: I don't know. Is that my action?

3373
03:59:23,706 --> 03:59:27,328
MATT: I'd say because you're already there and
shouting at him, it can be a bonus action. So if

3374
03:59:27,328 --> 03:59:28,926
you want to take your action still.

3375
03:59:28,926 --> 03:59:35,389
SAM: I can't do anything, I'm behind all those
fucking people. Well, if we're fighting then, I

3376
03:59:35,389 --> 03:59:44,586
can't do much. I will just-- I will blind him this
time.

3377
03:59:44,586 --> 03:59:45,424
MATT: Okay.

3378
03:59:45,424 --> 03:59:46,762
SAM: Can I do that?

3379
03:59:46,762 --> 03:59:47,541
MATT: Sure.

3380
03:59:47,541 --> 03:59:49,607
SAM: I'll blind him at a level three.

3381
03:59:49,607 --> 03:59:52,266
MATT: Ooh, level three blind.

3382
03:59:52,266 --> 03:59:53,544
TRAVIS: Blind him?

3383
03:59:53,544 --> 03:59:54,493
SAM: Blind.

3384
03:59:54,493 --> 03:59:55,710
TALIESIN: With science.

3385
03:59:55,710 --> 03:59:58,058
MATT: At level three just means you can target an
additional creature.

3386
03:59:58,058 --> 04:00:00,358
SAM: I know, I just don't have any level two
slots.

3387
04:00:00,358 --> 04:00:09,224
MATT: Okay, so spend it. No worries. All right, so
that's a constitution saving throw. That is a 19.

3388
04:00:09,224 --> 04:00:12,637
SAM: That's 19, so he saves.

3389
04:00:12,637 --> 04:00:14,174
MATT: Yeah, so he saves, unfortunately.

3390
04:00:14,174 --> 04:00:17,098
LAURA: This guy sucks.

3391
04:00:17,098 --> 04:00:19,203
SAM: Oh wait, I can blind one other person?

3392
04:00:19,203 --> 04:00:20,739
MATT: If you want to.

3393
04:00:20,739 --> 04:00:22,941
SAM: Nah, no, I won't.

3394
04:00:22,941 --> 04:00:25,206
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up.

3395
04:00:25,206 --> 04:00:29,137
ASHLEY: Oh, jeez. I don't know what to do. So
intimidating is not working?

3396
04:00:29,137 --> 04:00:30,020
LAURA: No.

3397
04:00:30,020 --> 04:00:33,563
ASHLEY: Can't we just take him out of there now
that he's all tied up?

3398
04:00:33,643 --> 04:00:38,381
MATT: He's not tied up. The vine grabbed around,
but doesn't appear to be really changing his

3399
04:00:38,381 --> 04:00:39,373
physicality.

3400
04:00:39,373 --> 04:00:52,434
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I make, with my Spiritual
Weapon, a sort of-- holding like a--

3401
04:00:52,434 --> 04:01:02,229
MATT: It's a weapon. Spiritual Weapon. Weapon's in
the name. What kind of weapon would you want to

3402
04:01:02,229 --> 04:01:03,415
summon?

3403
04:01:03,415 --> 04:01:13,119
ASHLEY: I want to make a lasso again. A lariat.
Maybe with a little stinger on the end. Just to

3404
04:01:13,119 --> 04:01:14,274
listen.

3405
04:01:14,274 --> 04:01:17,794
MATT: All right, a little lasso there.

3406
04:01:17,794 --> 04:01:19,382
ASHLEY: So his arms--

3407
04:01:19,382 --> 04:01:21,343
MATT: Well, we'll have to see.

3408
04:01:21,343 --> 04:01:22,383
ASHLEY: If it works.

3409
04:01:22,383 --> 04:01:27,989
MATT: So go ahead and roll and add your spell
attack. It has advantage, because he's prone still.

3410
04:01:27,989 --> 04:01:34,059
ASHLEY: That would be a natural 20.

3411
04:01:34,059 --> 04:01:36,075
(cheering)

3412
04:01:36,075 --> 04:01:37,348
MATT: He's also now grappled.

3413
04:01:37,348 --> 04:01:41,483
ASHLEY: He's also now grappled. Okay. Can the
stinger go right here to his neck?

3414
04:01:41,483 --> 04:01:48,788
MATT: Sure. It's right there. The spiritual energy
wraps around the body. He's held there, with the

3415
04:01:48,788 --> 04:01:51,600
vine both holding him there. The stinger (swish)
up over the throat.

3416
04:01:51,600 --> 04:01:55,322
LAURA: Brother. Come on. What are you gonna do?

3417
04:01:55,322 --> 04:01:59,043
TRAVIS: We take him the fuck out of here.

3418
04:01:59,043 --> 04:02:00,894
ASHLEY: Yeah, we got to take him out, yeah.

3419
04:02:00,894 --> 04:02:02,048
MATT: That the end of your turn?

3420
04:02:02,048 --> 04:02:07,925
ASHLEY: Yeah. But I can still-- has he dropped his
weapon? No?

3421
04:02:07,925 --> 04:02:10,474
MATT: The weapon's still clutched to him and
wrapped--

3422
04:02:10,474 --> 04:02:14,421
ASHLEY: Can I try to intimidate him with my extra
bonus attack and tell him to drop his weapon?

3423
04:02:14,421 --> 04:02:18,477
MATT: You get the sense he can't drop it, because
he's currently-- everything's wrapped up to him.

3424
04:02:18,477 --> 04:02:22,896
Between the lasso and the vine. And intimidation
doesn't seem to affect him anymore.

3425
04:02:22,896 --> 04:02:24,001
ASHLEY: Okay.

3426
04:02:24,001 --> 04:02:26,006
LAURA: How long does the spiritual weapon last?

3427
04:02:26,006 --> 04:02:29,330
MATT: It's concentration so can be a number of
rounds as long as she uses her bonus action to

3428
04:02:29,330 --> 04:02:30,135
maintain it.

3429
04:02:30,135 --> 04:02:31,244
ASHLEY: So concentrated.

3430
04:02:31,244 --> 04:02:35,177
MATT: Yes, I would recommend it. Vex?

3431
04:02:35,177 --> 04:02:39,228
LAURA: Me? Okay. Oh no, should I go in the room?

3432
04:02:39,228 --> 04:02:41,438
TALIESIN: Room's kind of busy, in my opinion.

3433
04:02:41,438 --> 04:02:46,571
LAURA: I feel like I don't want to. I just, okay.
You know what? I'm gonna Hunter's Mark him.

3434
04:02:46,571 --> 04:02:52,160
MATT: So you're gonna get over-- You still can't
see him at that distance, unfortunately.

3435
04:02:52,160 --> 04:02:54,338
LAURA: Seriously?

3436
04:02:54,338 --> 04:02:56,459
MATT: You've stayed at the far back. Um, so.

3437
04:02:56,459 --> 04:02:58,180
LAURA: Well then fuck it, I'm gonna just stay where
I am.

3438
04:02:58,180 --> 04:02:59,749
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's keep point.

3439
04:02:59,749 --> 04:03:02,054
LAURA: I'm gonna keep point. I'm gonna stay at the
back of the hallway, just in case.

3440
04:03:02,054 --> 04:03:04,091
MATT: All right. Vax, Percy?

3441
04:03:04,091 --> 04:03:05,811
LAURA: Again, still hiding.

3442
04:03:05,811 --> 04:03:11,854
LIAM: Okay. I've still got daggers turned around.
I'm gonna knock this fool out. Okay, yeah, and you

3443
04:03:11,854 --> 04:03:17,584
guys are right on top of him so first one is-- and
advantage because he's grappled and down, right?

3444
04:03:17,584 --> 04:03:18,418
MATT: Correct.

3445
04:03:18,418 --> 04:03:30,555
LIAM: So first one is 22. Second one is a natural
20. Third one is 20.

3446
04:03:30,555 --> 04:03:33,299
MATT: All right, so go for it. All three attacks
hit.

3447
04:03:33,299 --> 04:03:35,850
LIAM: All right, so the first one is regular
attack.

3448
04:03:35,850 --> 04:03:37,797
MATT: Well, you can't choose which one is the
sneak attack.

3449
04:03:37,797 --> 04:03:41,844
LIAM: Well, there is no sneak attack-- oh yeah,
yeah. I meant that the critical was on the second

3450
04:03:41,844 --> 04:03:43,353
one. That's what I meant.

3451
04:03:43,353 --> 04:03:44,634
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

3452
04:03:44,634 --> 04:03:59,355
LIAM: So the first one is 11 plus double this. 11
plus four, eight, 12, 15, 16, 22. So that's 44 plus--

3453
04:03:59,355 --> 04:04:00,990
LAURA: You don't double it.

3454
04:04:00,990 --> 04:04:06,989
LIAM: Oh, the second one's the critical attack.
Thank you. 22 plus seven is 30. I have three

3455
04:04:06,989 --> 04:04:18,586
attacks! 31. Second one is-- that's easy. 14. And
the third attack is ten. The second one was

3456
04:04:18,586 --> 04:04:20,190
critical, but much smaller.

3457
04:04:20,190 --> 04:04:25,291
MATT: All right. (fighting sounds) You slam down
on the face. You can see nose actually breaks

3458
04:04:25,291 --> 04:04:29,693
under the blunt of the weapon and blood begins to
pour out of his nostrils. And he's fighting now

3459
04:04:29,693 --> 04:04:31,601
and coughing up--

3460
04:04:31,601 --> 04:04:34,230
LAURA: Who's gonna tie him up? Who's in the
fucking room?

3461
04:04:34,230 --> 04:04:36,567
LIAM: And I'm gonna jump back ten feet again.

3462
04:04:36,567 --> 04:04:38,856
LAURA: And pull him out of the room. Anyone?

3463
04:04:38,856 --> 04:04:40,503
MATT: And Percy, you're holding?

3464
04:04:40,503 --> 04:04:41,596
TALIESIN: I'm holding.

3465
04:04:41,596 --> 04:04:42,895
MATT: All righty, Grog.

3466
04:04:42,895 --> 04:04:47,702
TRAVIS: I'm gonna take manacles out of the Bag of
Holding. Since he's holding-- his arms are pinned

3467
04:04:47,702 --> 04:04:52,570
to his chest. And I'm gonna clasp it on both of
his wrists. And then I'm gonna pick that

3468
04:04:52,570 --> 04:04:57,661
motherfucker up on my shoulder and walk out of the
room. I'd like to try.

3469
04:04:57,661 --> 04:05:00,176
ASHLEY: And I can help.

3470
04:05:00,176 --> 04:05:07,354
MATT: You can, by just controlling it with your
mind. So I will say, go ahead and make an

3471
04:05:07,354 --> 04:05:09,616
athletics check, just to--

3472
04:05:09,616 --> 04:05:11,079
TRAVIS: Strength or athletics?

3473
04:05:11,079 --> 04:05:15,681
MATT: This'd be athletics. Athletics is better for
you, technically.

3474
04:05:15,681 --> 04:05:18,289
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is. 20.

3475
04:05:18,289 --> 04:05:26,056
MATT: Yeah. You lift him over your shoulder, past
Pike. Take him out into the hallway. You gonna

3476
04:05:26,056 --> 04:05:28,872
keep him on your shoulder? Or slam him down?

3477
04:05:28,872 --> 04:05:31,285
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was gonna slam him into the wall.

3478
04:05:31,285 --> 04:05:39,987
MATT: Wham, whack, into the wall. Go ahead and
roll 1d6 plus your strength modifier. For the

3479
04:05:39,987 --> 04:05:44,163
sheer force of this, this near currently helpless
individual slammed against the stone wall.

3480
04:05:44,163 --> 04:05:45,286
TRAVIS: Seven.

3481
04:05:45,286 --> 04:05:46,513
MATT: All right.

3482
04:05:46,513 --> 04:05:52,952
LAURA: Can I toss Grog my-- some of the infinite
rope and tell him to tie him up, tie up his ankles too.

3483
04:05:52,952 --> 04:05:59,632
MATT: As you're holding? Sure. So Vex yells out to
you and throws you the source of the infinite rope,

3484
04:05:59,632 --> 04:06:04,174
you grab and begin to, if you want to, start tying
up. All right.

3485
04:06:04,174 --> 04:06:06,421
ASHLEY: Loot tying? I mean, rage tying.

3486
04:06:06,421 --> 04:06:07,456
MATT: Rage tying.

3487
04:06:07,456 --> 04:06:09,325
(laughter)

3488
04:06:09,325 --> 04:06:15,378
MATT: All right, great. Now it comes to Daxio's
turn. He's currently trying to resist the current

3489
04:06:15,378 --> 04:06:21,052
grappling and your attempt to tie him. That's gonna
be a natural 20 on athletics check.

3490
04:06:21,052 --> 04:06:23,495
LAURA: Yeah, but he's got his ankles tied up.

3491
04:06:23,495 --> 04:06:24,666
SAM: Not no more he don't.

3492
04:06:24,666 --> 04:06:34,236
MATT: Yeah, the manacles are there. You turn was
to lift him up and slam him into the wall, and

3493
04:06:34,236 --> 04:06:38,940
you're beginning to wrap him up. His turn
immediately afterward is he breaks out of the

3494
04:06:38,940 --> 04:06:40,410
lasso.

3495
04:06:40,457 --> 04:06:41,805
TRAVIS: The spirit weapon?

3496
04:06:41,805 --> 04:06:47,389
MATT: The spirit weapon lasso, and at that point,
still manages to (grunts) get back with half the

3497
04:06:47,389 --> 04:06:49,583
movement onto his feet.

3498
04:06:49,583 --> 04:06:52,157
TALIESIN: I can't take my turn now, can I?

3499
04:06:52,157 --> 04:06:59,539
MATT: You can, after this. He still has the
manacles on, which holding the polearm now

3500
04:06:59,539 --> 04:07:05,461
wouldn't do too much of a disadvantage to him. So
I say this round it doesn't do anything.

3501
04:07:05,461 --> 04:07:09,476
MARISHA: I know, it'd be a close grip.

3502
04:07:09,476 --> 04:07:12,786
MATT: The grip's pretty tight.

3503
04:07:12,786 --> 04:07:16,223
LAURA: He wouldn't be able to get a firm grip on the
swing, it'd be like.

3504
04:07:16,223 --> 04:07:18,371
LIAM: Let him be a hardass.

3505
04:07:18,371 --> 04:07:21,946
MARISHA: As a fight-- as a staff user that's--

3506
04:07:21,946 --> 04:07:29,884
MATT: All right, so disadvantage on attacks with
this. But they're all against Keyleth.

3507
04:07:29,884 --> 04:07:32,920
(laughter)

3508
04:07:32,920 --> 04:07:34,836
ASHLEY: Oh no.

3509
04:07:34,836 --> 04:07:37,563
MARISHA: You know what? Bring it, bitch.

3510
04:07:37,563 --> 04:07:44,768
MATT: All right. So Daxio gets up. Seeing Grog had
taken the majority of the attacks and looking over

3511
04:07:44,768 --> 04:07:49,354
at the druid that made the vine curl and drag him to
the ground. Turns over and--

3512
04:07:49,354 --> 04:07:50,529
MARISHA: 'Sup?

3513
04:07:50,529 --> 04:07:59,130
MATT: Makes three strikes against you. The first
one is going to be-- all right, so that is a 15?

3514
04:07:59,130 --> 04:08:00,194
MARISHA: Miss.

3515
04:08:00,194 --> 04:08:08,638
MATT: All right. Second one-- natural one on the
second roll. Metal's clinking against the wall.

3516
04:08:08,638 --> 04:08:13,954
Third one-- is going to be a 17?

3517
04:08:13,954 --> 04:08:17,164
MARISHA: 17 is exactly what he needed.

3518
04:08:17,164 --> 04:08:27,450
MATT: 17 does hit, all right. It's going to try and
trip-attack you, so you take as this third

3519
04:08:27,450 --> 04:08:33,614
strike-- 12 points of slashing damage. And make a
strength saving throw.

3520
04:08:33,614 --> 04:08:38,697
MARISHA: 15.

3521
04:08:38,697 --> 04:08:45,503
MATT: 15. With that, slams it around and hits you
right about the kneecap. The blade hits the armor

3522
04:08:45,503 --> 04:08:48,682
and it guards most of it, but the sheer force of
the impact knocks you off your feet and you land

3523
04:08:48,682 --> 04:08:57,365
face-down on the ground, in front. With that,
Daxio uses the momentum of the strike to

3524
04:08:57,365 --> 04:09:03,545
and use the action surge ability. He's gonna do
three more strikes against your now-prone self.

3525
04:09:03,545 --> 04:09:07,805
With disadvantage, and you're prone so each attack
has no disadvantage against you.

3526
04:09:07,805 --> 04:09:10,805
MARISHA: Yeah.

3527
04:09:10,805 --> 04:09:13,032
MATT: That's a natural 20.

3528
04:09:13,032 --> 04:09:14,674
LAURA: (gasps)

3529
04:09:14,674 --> 04:09:23,673
MATT: First one-- and these are all Great Weapon
Master. This one's gonna be a 23. And this is

3530
04:09:23,673 --> 04:09:34,578
gonna be a 18. And this one is a 21.
So all three hit?

3531
04:09:34,578 --> 04:09:35,746
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3532
04:09:35,746 --> 04:09:37,276
ASHLEY: I got you girl.

3533
04:09:37,276 --> 04:09:39,524
MARISHA: Is this all for that staff comment?

3534
04:09:39,524 --> 04:09:47,883
MATT: It's pretty harsh. But also, given the
circumstance that you were, from his perspective,

3535
04:09:47,883 --> 04:09:53,028
the one that was trying to hold him in place too.
And Grog hasn't taken much visual impact from the

3536
04:09:53,028 --> 04:09:59,596
blows. You're the one that's currently protecting
him from rushing off in that direction. Say what

3537
04:09:59,596 --> 04:10:01,674
you want. But anyway. That is--

3538
04:10:01,674 --> 04:10:08,641
(laughter)

3539
04:10:08,641 --> 04:10:14,015
MATT: 30 points of slashing damage from the first
strike. That's the critical.

3540
04:10:14,015 --> 04:10:19,416
MARISHA: Uh-huh. (laughs)

3541
04:10:19,416 --> 04:10:21,825
MATT: The next one is 24 points of slashing
damage.

3542
04:10:21,825 --> 04:10:23,026
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

3543
04:10:23,026 --> 04:10:26,498
MATT: And this last one is 21 points of slashing
damage.

3544
04:10:26,498 --> 04:10:27,868
ASHLEY: She's out?

3545
04:10:27,868 --> 04:10:32,344
TALIESIN: No. She's standing. Or I mean, she's
not, but--

3546
04:10:32,344 --> 04:10:35,208
MATT: That ends Daxio's turn. You're up, Keyleth.

3547
04:10:35,208 --> 04:10:36,467
TALIESIN: Oh wait!

3548
04:10:36,467 --> 04:10:37,964
MATT: Oh yeah, Percy, you're making your action,
that's right.

3549
04:10:37,964 --> 04:10:47,125
TALIESIN: I'm gonna pull grit shot to the hands.
With the new pistol.

3550
04:10:47,125 --> 04:10:48,878
LAURA: With the new weapon?

3551
04:10:48,878 --> 04:10:51,736
SAM: That might explode.

3552
04:10:51,736 --> 04:10:58,526
TALIESIN: That's a 21 to hit.

3553
04:10:58,526 --> 04:11:00,006
MATT: That hits.

3554
04:11:00,006 --> 04:11:01,277
TALIESIN: All right, drop it.

3555
04:11:01,277 --> 04:11:02,942
MATT: Make a strength saving throw?

3556
04:11:02,942 --> 04:11:04,165
TALIESIN: Let me double-check.

3557
04:11:04,165 --> 04:11:11,821
MATT: No, I made a change to that, because--
That's gonna be a 21.

3558
04:11:11,821 --> 04:11:13,085
TALIESIN: Against my?

3559
04:11:13,085 --> 04:11:16,727
MATT: Against the DC for all your other abilities.
So I'm pretty sure that he resists it.

3560
04:11:16,727 --> 04:11:19,743
TALIESIN: Against my DC?

3561
04:11:19,743 --> 04:11:24,680
MATT: Against your DC, yeah. So you take your first
shot. It does damage-- It does no damage, this is the--

3562
04:11:24,680 --> 04:11:27,150
TALIESIN: No, this does no damage. I don't know
what my DC is.

3563
04:11:27,150 --> 04:11:33,594
MATT: I think for this one, if I look at the
change I made for the update on the gunslinger.

3564
04:11:33,594 --> 04:11:37,936
Let me go ahead and check real fast. Stay with me
folks.

3565
04:11:37,936 --> 04:11:43,798
SAM: Is this gun called Little Sparky?

3566
04:11:43,798 --> 04:11:45,487
MATT: It's the arms you said, right?

3567
04:11:45,487 --> 04:11:46,705
TALIESIN: Hands, yeah.

3568
04:11:46,705 --> 04:11:49,576
MATT: Actually, no, I did not change this one. He
doesn't get a saving throw. He drops it, no

3569
04:11:49,576 --> 04:11:50,733
damage.

3570
04:11:50,733 --> 04:11:51,939
(clapping)

3571
04:11:51,939 --> 04:11:57,428
MATT: So as Keyleth is on the ground being hacked
by this glaive, he lifts up again for another

3572
04:11:57,428 --> 04:12:03,068
brutal strike and (shooting sound) this echoing
blast sound hits as the glaive is knocked out of

3573
04:12:03,068 --> 04:12:04,111
his hands.

3574
04:12:04,111 --> 04:12:06,951
MARISHA: I just go to my earpiece and I go: Thank
you, Percy.

3575
04:12:06,951 --> 04:12:11,402
TALIESIN: Did we-- are we going to go with that
discussion we had about the torso shot, or are we

3576
04:12:11,402 --> 04:12:19,761
dropping that for now? Dropping it for now?
Totally okay. In that case, I'm just going to take

3577
04:12:19,761 --> 04:12:23,354
two sharpshooter shots to drag him down a little
bit.

3578
04:12:23,354 --> 04:12:24,772
MATT: Okay.

3579
04:12:24,772 --> 04:12:30,970
TALIESIN: That's 18, 19, 20, 27 to hit.

3580
04:12:30,970 --> 04:12:32,405
MATT: 27 hits.

3581
04:12:32,405 --> 04:12:43,642
TALIESIN: That does-- God, new gun, there we are.
That's six, 22 points of damage.

3582
04:12:43,642 --> 04:12:46,515
SAM: Yeah, Little Sparky.

3583
04:12:46,515 --> 04:12:49,195
TALIESIN: And that's 17 to hit.

3584
04:12:49,195 --> 04:12:52,236
MATT: 17 to hit, yeah, just hits.

3585
04:12:52,236 --> 04:13:00,684
TALIESIN: And that's 23 points of damage. And
that's all she wrote.

3586
04:13:00,684 --> 04:13:02,276
MATT: All right. How do you want to do this?

3587
04:13:02,276 --> 04:13:03,283
(gasps)

3588
04:13:03,283 --> 04:13:04,971
LAURA: Wait, wait, keep him alive.

3589
04:13:04,971 --> 04:13:06,938
TRAVIS: I don't think we have a chance now.

3590
04:13:06,938 --> 04:13:08,223
TALIESIN: Well, we do.

3591
04:13:08,223 --> 04:13:10,508
MARISHA: Fucking dick, he deserves it.

3592
04:13:10,508 --> 04:13:18,322
TALIESIN: I want to take both of those shots, and
try and graze his collarbones with both those

3593
04:13:18,322 --> 04:13:23,450
shots. It'll heal, but he's gonna have a really
hard time lifting his arms, for like the next

3594
04:13:23,450 --> 04:13:25,400
couple months.

3595
04:13:25,400 --> 04:13:32,506
MATT: Okay. So with those shots (gunshot) a splash
of blood with bits of splintered bone come

3596
04:13:32,506 --> 04:13:38,857
shooting out of the half-plate armor he's been
wearing as the metal itself blows open from the

3597
04:13:38,857 --> 04:13:45,000
impact of the first blast. With the glaive still
clinking to the ground behind him and him reacting,

3598
04:13:45,000 --> 04:13:50,480
the first impact sends him back and he leans
against the wall, looks up to see the source of

3599
04:13:50,480 --> 04:13:54,996
the impact. Looks into your eyes for a second and
before he has a moment of reaction the second

3600
04:13:54,996 --> 04:14:00,995
blast comes out (gunshot) shattering the other
part of the clavicle. You can now see the armor

3601
04:14:00,995 --> 04:14:06,455
sundered on each shoulder and blood beginning to
pour over the sides of where the armor's been

3602
04:14:06,455 --> 04:14:11,294
torn. He slumps to the ground (groaning).

3603
04:14:11,294 --> 04:14:13,711
TALIESIN: You're lucky. It'll even heal.

3604
04:14:13,711 --> 04:14:27,083
MATT: (panting) "Do what you must. But I am his
blood. His dominion will call back, call me back

3605
04:14:27,083 --> 04:14:29,944
"when everything else has fallen into nothing."

3606
04:14:29,944 --> 04:14:39,636
LAURA: Are you talking about Dres-- Vecna? Are you
talking about Vecna?

3607
04:14:39,636 --> 04:14:41,726
MATT: (low chuckle)

3608
04:14:41,726 --> 04:14:43,286
LAURA: Oh, that's a yes.

3609
04:14:43,286 --> 04:14:46,867
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that didn't go very well. I'm
afraid you might be out of luck.

3610
04:14:46,867 --> 04:14:51,190
LIAM: We've got about 50 more minutes in here.
What say we drag this asshole out of here?

3611
04:14:51,190 --> 04:14:53,283
LAURA: Let's get this fucker out of here.

3612
04:14:53,283 --> 04:14:55,409
TALIESIN: Grog, tie him up! And let's get you, do
you need--?

3613
04:14:55,409 --> 04:15:02,325
MARISHA: Yeah, Keyleth gets up and bleeding from
my mouth. And I just take him and I grab him by

3614
04:15:02,325 --> 04:15:10,598
his face. and I just say: Fucking traitor. And I
spit a big glob of blood in his face.

3615
04:15:10,598 --> 04:15:14,607
TALIESIN: And she's the nice one.

3616
04:15:14,607 --> 04:15:17,039
MARISHA: It's true. (laughs)

3617
04:15:17,039 --> 04:15:23,528
TRAVIS: I pick him up, I put him over my shoulder
and we start to walk out of the hall.

3618
04:15:23,528 --> 04:15:26,782
ASHLEY: And I'm gonna heal Keyleth.

3619
04:15:26,782 --> 04:15:30,939
MATT: Okay. He's-- in the process of you tying him
up and jostling him over, he falls pretty much

3620
04:15:30,939 --> 04:15:35,535
nearly unconscious. He's fading in and out of
consciousness right now. Every now and then you

3621
04:15:35,535 --> 04:15:40,651
feel a little chuckle come out of him on your
shoulder. (dark chuckle) and then passes out

3622
04:15:40,651 --> 04:15:41,797
again.

3623
04:15:41,797 --> 04:15:43,723
TALIESIN: I pick up the glaive also.

3624
04:15:43,723 --> 04:15:44,729
MATT: Okay.

3625
04:15:44,729 --> 04:15:56,919
ASHLEY: Wait, what was I at? 30.

3626
04:15:56,919 --> 04:16:00,273
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you heal 30 points.

3627
04:16:00,273 --> 04:16:01,825
MARISHA: Oh, that's very good.

3628
04:16:01,825 --> 04:16:06,480
MATT: What do you do now?

3629
04:16:06,480 --> 04:16:08,167
LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here.

3630
04:16:08,167 --> 04:16:15,991
MATT: With Daxio over your shoulder, you guys
quickly head back into the hallway, emptied, the

3631
04:16:15,991 --> 04:16:18,044
doorway still lies open as you guys left it. And--

3632
04:16:18,044 --> 04:16:23,455
LIAM: I get that piece of chalk and in thieves'
cant I'm going to write on the wall: Much appreciated, Uriel

3633
04:16:23,525 --> 04:16:25,368
sends his regards, V.

3634
04:16:25,368 --> 04:16:28,335
MATT: All right, okay. You close the door behind
you.

3635
04:16:28,335 --> 04:16:30,923
TRAVIS: Do we want to check those other rooms?

3636
04:16:30,923 --> 04:16:32,720
LAURA and LIAM: No.

3637
04:16:32,773 --> 04:16:34,436
SAM: Oh, what about the room he was in?

3638
04:16:34,436 --> 04:16:35,246
LIAM: No.

3639
04:16:35,246 --> 04:16:36,987
SAM: What do you mean no? What if he had-- he had
stuff to travel with.

3640
04:16:36,987 --> 04:16:38,758
LAURA: That's true, he had a lot of money with
him.

3641
04:16:38,758 --> 04:16:39,904
TALIESIN: I'll do a quick rummage of it.

3642
04:16:39,904 --> 04:16:42,494
Very quick.

3643
04:16:42,494 --> 04:16:46,400
MATT: All right. Make an investigation roll.

3644
04:16:46,400 --> 04:16:49,246
LAURA: I'm gonna hang out by the door, I'm gonna
let him hang out.

3645
04:16:49,246 --> 04:16:52,979
TALIESIN: I'm an idiot, so I'm going to roll a
six.

3646
04:16:52,979 --> 04:16:54,772
SAM: I'm going to go in and do it too.

3647
04:16:54,772 --> 04:16:58,924
ASHLEY: Can I wedge the door open or something?

3648
04:16:58,924 --> 04:16:59,961
SAM: 20.

3649
04:16:59,961 --> 04:17:02,520
MATT: You guys take a few more moments, thankfully
there's no real pressure. you have plenty of time

3650
04:17:02,520 --> 04:17:08,735
going forward. You guys go through the room.
Underneath his bed, up inside the actual wooden

3651
04:17:08,735 --> 04:17:17,258
frame of the bed itself, in part of the cushion,
you feel there is a large sack of something. You

3652
04:17:17,258 --> 04:17:18,736
pull it out and--

3653
04:17:18,736 --> 04:17:23,355
SAM: I'll hang on to that. I need it.

3654
04:17:23,355 --> 04:17:26,755
LAURA: I'm sure you do, but you lost yours so I'm
gonna hold on to it for you.

3655
04:17:26,755 --> 04:17:29,057
TALIESIN: You've proven to be irresponsible.

3656
04:17:29,057 --> 04:17:31,843
SAM: I have had the most money of all of us.

3657
04:17:31,843 --> 04:17:33,766
LAURA: I take it.

3658
04:17:33,766 --> 04:17:37,914
MATT: It contains, I'll say for the sake of--
you're probably counting it as you go up the

3659
04:17:37,914 --> 04:17:40,578
stairs, because you're Vex. 3,002 gold pieces.

3660
04:17:40,578 --> 04:17:42,132
SAM: I'm back to normal.

3661
04:17:42,132 --> 04:17:43,624
TALIESIN: No, you're not. Because it's--

3662
04:17:43,624 --> 04:17:44,523
SAM: I found it.

3663
04:17:44,523 --> 04:17:45,776
TALIESIN: I know, but we took it away from you.

3664
04:17:45,776 --> 04:17:46,744
SAM: No you didn't.

3665
04:17:46,744 --> 04:17:47,425
TALIESIN: Yes we did.

3666
04:17:47,425 --> 04:17:48,523
SAM: You didn't even find it.

3667
04:17:48,523 --> 04:17:49,662
TALIESIN: We saw you find it.

3668
04:17:49,662 --> 04:17:51,858
TRAVIS: Excuse me, no interest in the other rooms,
or shall we leave?

3669
04:17:51,858 --> 04:17:52,898
TALIESIN: Let's just go.

3670
04:17:52,898 --> 04:17:55,072
LIAM: We're outstaying our welcome, let's go now.

3671
04:17:55,072 --> 04:17:57,480
MATT: All right. You guys head back up the
stairway, leading back into the storage room,

3672
04:17:57,480 --> 04:18:00,520
outside of the kitchen. How are you going to
proceed from the kitchen?

3673
04:18:00,520 --> 04:18:04,293
TRAVIS: We could set it on fire.

3674
04:18:04,293 --> 04:18:07,511
MARISHA: The cooks are back in the kitchen?

3675
04:18:07,511 --> 04:18:12,093
MATT: If you glance around and you look, you can
listen. You do hear the sound of pots and various sounds--

3676
04:18:12,093 --> 04:18:13,567
LIAM: What the fuck are the cooks gonna do?

3677
04:18:13,567 --> 04:18:14,712
TRAVIS: We're on the fucking council.

3678
04:18:14,712 --> 04:18:20,069
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, what are they gonna do now?
Oh, hang on. Are we about to walk through a very

3679
04:18:20,069 --> 04:18:21,181
crowded bar?

3680
04:18:21,181 --> 04:18:24,101
LAURA: No, we're not. We're going to leave through
the alley, where Trinket is waiting. We can toss

3681
04:18:24,101 --> 04:18:26,203
him over Trinket's back. We just walk on out.

3682
04:18:26,203 --> 04:18:27,480
TRAVIS: We just walk through the kitchen.

3683
04:18:27,480 --> 04:18:32,183
MATT: You guys head up to the kitchen, as you guys
come stomping up in succession, carrying the

3684
04:18:32,183 --> 04:18:37,423
bleeding and unconscious Daxio on the back, the
younger gentleman who's working in the kitchen who's

3685
04:18:37,423 --> 04:18:43,113
in the middle of cooking something in a large
cast iron pan, goes: "You can't be in here!"

3686
04:18:43,113 --> 04:18:45,196
ASHLEY: We're leaving, we're leaving!

3687
04:18:45,196 --> 04:18:49,269
TALIESIN: And my compliments to the chef. Good
night.

3688
04:18:49,269 --> 04:18:53,518
MATT: And then you guys head back into the
alleyway. Trinket eagerly (bear grunts).

3689
04:18:53,518 --> 04:18:54,718
LAURA: Hey darling.

3690
04:18:54,718 --> 04:18:56,674
MATT: Licks your face. (slurping sounds)

3691
04:18:56,674 --> 04:18:58,944
LAURA: Could you do us a favor and carry him?

3692
04:18:58,944 --> 04:19:00,953
MATT: Comes up to you and nudges you to--

3693
04:19:00,953 --> 04:19:07,030
SAM: I tell them: I'll catch up, guys. I have to
say goodbye to my mates.

3694
04:19:07,030 --> 04:19:10,206
TALIESIN: Can we frisk him while we're waiting?

3695
04:19:10,206 --> 04:19:11,964
LaURA: I like it. Can I dig in his pockets?

3696
04:19:11,964 --> 04:19:20,337
MATT: Digging in his pockets, you find a strange
holy symbol that appears to be a skull that is

3697
04:19:20,337 --> 04:19:22,477
missing the left side of its face.

3698
04:19:22,477 --> 04:19:28,291
ASHLEY: Can I do a religion check on it?

3699
04:19:28,291 --> 04:19:31,219
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

3700
04:19:31,219 --> 04:19:33,120
ASHLEY: 15.

3701
04:19:33,120 --> 04:19:41,012
MATT: 15. Based on the conversations you've had
with the party and the seeming subtle rise of

3702
04:19:41,012 --> 04:19:47,730
worshipers of Vecna, intertwined with the
Whitestone scenario, this is a symbol of Vecna.

3703
04:19:47,730 --> 04:19:55,382
It's not a holy symbol per se, more than it's just
some sort of a token or some sort of a-- it has a

3704
04:19:55,382 --> 04:19:57,137
purpose that isn't magical.

3705
04:19:57,137 --> 04:19:58,945
SAM: It is magic?

3706
04:19:58,945 --> 04:20:00,218
ASHLEY &amp; TRAVIS: It's not.

3707
04:20:00,218 --> 04:20:05,672
MATT: So, while you're doing that, Scanlan, you
head back into the tavern, and in the time that's

3708
04:20:05,672 --> 04:20:12,907
passed, you can see now your band with Dr. Dranzel,
they're all gathered together and they're

3709
04:20:12,907 --> 04:20:19,189
finishing up their drinks, and it looks like they're
ready to go ahead and find their way out on the

3710
04:20:19,189 --> 04:20:23,407
town for the evening, and as soon as you walk into
the room they all look over, "Scanlan! (laughs)

3711
04:20:23,407 --> 04:20:24,734
"Good to see you, friend."

3712
04:20:24,734 --> 04:20:31,062
SAM: Hi, hi, sorry I disappeared there for a
while, I just got a little distracted. Just wanted

3713
04:20:31,062 --> 04:20:35,039
to say it was wonderful running into you, if
you'll be around for another week, you said?

3714
04:20:35,039 --> 04:20:36,442
MATT: "Another week, yes."

3715
04:20:36,442 --> 04:20:42,435
SAM: Well, our paths may cross again, and if you
know, or can ask around where Greyskull Keep is,

3716
04:20:42,435 --> 04:20:50,358
come pay us a visit. I would love to talk to you
about the past, and history, and your travels and

3717
04:20:50,358 --> 04:20:51,649
mine, all right?

3718
04:20:51,649 --> 04:20:53,723
MATT: "All right. Greyskull Keep, you say?"

3719
04:20:53,723 --> 04:20:56,690
SAM: It's actually called Greyskull Embassy, now.

3720
04:20:56,690 --> 04:21:02,940
MATT: (laughs) "You're an ass."

3721
04:21:02,940 --> 04:21:05,891
(laughter)

3722
04:21:05,891 --> 04:21:07,187
MATT: "I'll see you at your keep."

3723
04:21:07,187 --> 04:21:08,918
SAM: And I turn to-- what is her name? Kaylie?

3724
04:21:08,918 --> 04:21:14,102
MATT: Kaylie, who is already behind you, as you
turn she goes, "Greyskull Keep, is it?"

3725
04:21:14,102 --> 04:21:17,452
SAM: Yes, it is. My room's on the second floor.

3726
04:21:17,452 --> 04:21:20,012
MATT: "All right."

3727
04:21:20,012 --> 04:21:23,215
MARISHA: Playing the long game, I like it.

3728
04:21:23,215 --> 04:21:30,458
MATT: You step out of the tavern and meet with the
rest of your allies, and as the sun sets on the

3729
04:21:30,458 --> 04:21:38,987
distant western sky over Emon, Vox Machina makes
its way back to its keep, with its current quarry.

3730
04:21:38,987 --> 04:21:41,541
And we'll end it for tonight, unless you--

3731
04:21:41,541 --> 04:21:43,637
TRAVIS: We're taking him to Uriel, right?

3732
04:21:43,637 --> 04:21:47,367
LIAM: Just as a minor detail, as we're walking,
almost like a magic trick, I wanna grab my cloak

3733
04:21:47,367 --> 04:21:50,407
and yank it off Pike and wrap it up and put it
into my pocket.

3734
04:21:50,407 --> 04:21:51,840
MATT: Okay.

3735
04:21:51,840 --> 04:21:53,819
TRAVIS: We're taking him to Uriel, we're taking him
to Uriel.

3736
04:21:53,819 --> 04:21:55,381
MATT: The flowers are still standing.

3737
04:21:55,381 --> 04:21:57,834
TRAVIS: We're not taking him to our place, we're
taking him to Uriel.

3738
04:21:57,834 --> 04:21:59,258
MATT: Are you going to your keep, or are you going
to Uriel?

3739
04:21:59,258 --> 04:22:00,284
TRAVIS: To Uriel.

3740
04:22:00,284 --> 04:22:05,656
MATT: Then you make a quick turn and start heading
back towards the Cloudtop District. And that's

3741
04:22:05,656 --> 04:22:07,918
where we'll end it for the evening!

3742
04:22:07,918 --> 04:22:10,241
TRAVIS: Walk off into the sunset, credits roll,
they turn right.

3743
04:22:10,241 --> 04:22:12,340
MARISHA: Oh shit, forgot.

3744
04:22:12,340 --> 04:22:13,958
TALIESIN: Freeze frame!

3745
04:22:13,958 --> 04:22:18,910
LAURA: 2,600 gold to get some booty, I like it.

3746
04:22:18,910 --> 04:22:21,926
ASHLEY: Oh, we didn't get to talk about your
sword!

3747
04:22:21,926 --> 04:22:25,061
MATT: No, never had an opportunity to discuss it.

3748
04:22:25,061 --> 04:22:26,458
TRAVIS: Nope, haven't had a minute.

3749
04:22:26,458 --> 04:22:28,718
MATT: I guess you'll have to Skype in next week.

3750
04:22:28,718 --> 04:22:30,158
ASHLEY: I might be able to.

3751
04:22:30,158 --> 04:22:31,477
MATT: If you can, that'd be awesome.

3752
04:22:31,477 --> 04:22:32,992
LIAM: Don't make me talk to him, because it won't
go well.

3753
04:22:32,992 --> 04:22:35,716
ASHLEY: No no no, no. We just didn't get a chance
to talk to him about his sword.

3754
04:22:35,716 --> 04:22:42,154
MATT: Well, cool. Back in the swing of things, our
first game of the year, got some story beats

3755
04:22:42,154 --> 04:22:48,122
completed, and some other mysteries put in there,
just a fun little step into Scanlan's old world,

3756
04:22:48,122 --> 04:22:49,419
that was pretty cool.

3757
04:22:49,419 --> 04:22:51,027
MARISHA: Yeah! Scanlan backstory.

3758
04:22:51,027 --> 04:22:52,704
SAM: I wanna get some more into that!

3759
04:22:52,704 --> 04:22:54,845
MATT: Oh, and we're dropping shit.

3760
04:22:54,845 --> 04:23:00,049
MARISHA: Oh, popcorn down. So next week we're
doing Critmas, next week.

3761
04:23:00,049 --> 04:23:06,311
MATT: Yeah, we're doing Critmas next week, so be
ready for that. Gonna watch us see what the new

3762
04:23:06,311 --> 04:23:11,746
year has in store, looks like they've got some
great possible charity gifts coming, I'm excited

3763
04:23:11,746 --> 04:23:16,054
to see what they got us, so. Well all right then!
We're gonna go ahead and get ourselves out and

3764
04:23:16,054 --> 04:23:22,176
sleeping for tomorrow morning. Thank you, guys,
for coming and geeking with us, we'll see you next

3765
04:23:22,176 --> 04:23:27,356
week, and happy new year, guys.
