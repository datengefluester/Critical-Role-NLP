1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:03,861
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

2
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:08,443
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Glad you could join us for

3
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:15,416
what is essentially the final and epilogue episode
of our five-year campaign. We're excited you guys

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,653
could come join us.

5
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:17,988
SAM: Not the final episode of the show!

6
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:23,595
MATT: We will return. We're looking probably at
the start of the new year with a new campaign, new

7
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:24,736
characters.

8
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:26,651
LAURA: But we'll have one-shots and stuff in
between.

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,933
MATT: Yeah, we'll have fun stuff to break it up
and give us some time to let off some steam in the

10
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:35,141
meantime. But before we get into tonight's game,
let's get through some quick announcements. First

11
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:38,474
off, we wanted to give a shout out. If you guys
haven't seen it yet, Shadow of War just came out,

12
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:42,987
the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. A bunch of us have
worked on it and if you haven't seen, we had the

13
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:48,240
opportunity to do a cool thing with WB Games and
the folks at Monolith. We did a Shadow of War

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,776
one-shot that was uploaded as a two-parter.

15
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,387
LAURA: It was so much fun!

16
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:57,335
LIAM: You were so cute, all of you. It was the
cutest orc adventure that ever happened.

17
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:59,481
SAM: You watched it?

18
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,127
LIAM: Both episodes.

19
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,518
LAURA: Thanks bro!

20
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,868
MATT: It was a lot of fun. We had Sam, Laura,
Travis, and the illustrious Darin De Paul as our

21
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:13,897
four orcs and/or olog-hai, charging their way
through Mordor in hopes of victory spoils and all that.

22
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:16,789
LAURA: It's <i>real</i> fun to be stupid.

23
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,292
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're talking about.

24
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,251
MATT: So I recommend checking it out if you
haven't yet. Merch update, Laura?

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:28,714
LIAM: Wait! Something I can say now. I didn't have
the green light, but I am in that game. I had to

26
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:37,736
fib and say that I wasn't in that game, but I'm in
that game! I am back as Gollum! And I run around

27
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:44,043
and I do this, and I do this, and I do this, and I
do this. (Gollum voice) Tasty fish!

28
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:49,997
MATT: If you guys haven't seen Liam's Gollum in
the games, it's the most ridiculous--

29
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:54,824
TRAVIS: Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap
for it. Not just the VO.

30
00:01:54,824 --> 00:02:00,809
LIAM: Broke my back, scuttled around like I was a
young buck, which I'm not. It was great!

31
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:06,500
LAURA: I wish I still had the video of you that
you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,692
first started playing Gollum, he sent me this
video of him running around his living room,

33
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:15,405
jumping up on his couch, then running over and
jumping up your entertainment system or

34
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:16,423
something.

35
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:20,376
LIAM: I put my laptop on the coffee table, I hit
click, and I started going--

36
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,605
LAURA: It was so amazing.

37
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,752
LIAM: Because I'm a nerd.

38
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:29,262
MATT: Awesome. Well, thank you for the follow-up
on that, Liam. Laura?

39
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:35,141
LAURA: Oh, well, technically, I have to shove this
one to Liam and Taliesin, as well.

40
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:39,999
TALIESIN: I feel like we've been doing the thing
for a while now.

41
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,783
LIAM: Yeah, like when parents have a baby, you
don't see them for a while. They're with that baby

42
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:48,181
every hour, every minute.

43
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:55,311
(yelling)

44
00:02:55,311 --> 00:03:01,584
LIAM: Oh my gosh, it's the new art book! Oh my
god, it's gorgeous! I took it out of the Ark of

45
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,178
the Covenant, and here it is!

46
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:08,370
LAURA: Okay, I should qualify this, because it's
not in the store yet, you guys, so don't go to the

47
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,611
store and freak out. It just came into the
office.

48
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,283
LIAM: Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There
will be more details--

49
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,319
SAM: What does it say on the title there?

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,308
LIAM: It says The Chronicles of Exandria: The Tale
of Vox Machina. One.

51
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:26,298
SAM: Volume One? Implying that there's going to be
more?

52
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,535
TALIESIN: Implying that we'd like to.

53
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:35,383
LIAM: We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune
in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have

54
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,776
more info, more details.

55
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:40,454
LAURA: We'll say when they're going to go in the
store.

56
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,363
MATT: Can you give a teaser flip of any pages?

57
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:51,985
LIAM: I have been told that I cannot give a teaser
flip. But wait, guys. There's more! Taliesin, if

58
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,234
you would?

59
00:03:53,234 --> 00:04:00,469
TALIESIN: Well, we did two editions because we
wanted to do something a little ridiculous. And so--

60
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:05,357
SAM: What is this? A special edition?

61
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:13,052
TALIESIN: This is a special edition. It's a little
more fancy. It's got the ribbon and leather and

62
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:20,604
gold foil. It's got an evil tome vibe, and it's
got lots of little wonderful details.

63
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:28,392
LIAM: We have held that book and looked through
it. I cried 97 times in one minute. It is so

64
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:29,949
beautiful.

65
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,392
MARISHA: It really looks like crying for 60
seconds.

66
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:39,174
LAURA: Tune in to Talks Machina on Tuesday. We'll
give you more details about how you can purchase

67
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:44,794
them. And you can always check out
geekandsundry.com/artbook for more updates.

68
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:49,408
They're coming soon. They should be in the
warehouse very soon, so that's happy for the

69
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,724
holidays.

70
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,178
LIAM: Joe Madureira art!

71
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,671
LAURA: I'm excited!

72
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,622
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's lots to talk about in
these books. I'm very excited!

73
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:05,485
TRAVIS: And to cure any freakout, Ashley is going
to join us. She's finishing up.

74
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:09,874
MATT: Finishing up shooting on Blindspot. So
she'll pop in when she can.

75
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,684
LAURA: This <i>is</i> her day job!

76
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:14,540
TALIESIN: We keep trying to tell her that, don't
we?

77
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,234
LIAM: Wait. There's one last thing.

78
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,878
SAM: Two more editions of the art book!

79
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:31,269
LIAM: I got one last thing, for funsies. It's a
really late birthday present. It's kind of for

80
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:40,359
funsies, but Travis, I have something for you that
I've been wanting to give you for a while.

81
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,182
SAM: Is that an experience?

82
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:46,194
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

83
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:47,750
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,458
TRAVIS: What the fuck is this? (gasps)

85
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,588
SAM: Is it the Belt of Dwarvenkind?!

86
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:57,854
(yelling)

87
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:00,304
LAURA: Look at how big the face is!

88
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:10,975
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Hug me through my wife! That's
so great! I can't get hit in the dick with this

89
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:19,474
on! This is amazing! It really covers the whole
kit and kaboodle!

90
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:25,073
LIAM: And your beard will double in length the
moment you put it on. I had to repay you for the

91
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:27,492
raven mask you gave me, once upon a time.

92
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:34,296
LAURA: Oh yeah, our drunken ren fair purchases. I
was like, "that's a cool mask! Where'd you get it?"

93
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,764
And you said, "you got that for me."

94
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,180
LIAM: Your husband just bought this for me!
Thanks, Laura!

95
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:51,624
MATT: There you go. Also immune to poison. Good
job. Perfect! So other updates. We are officially

96
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:56,811
announcing the second edition of Vox Machina:
Origins, the Critical Role comic. It's going to be

97
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:06,718
available October 18th, so look for that on all
your great comic book-- Comixology, the Dark Horse

98
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:18,957
app, and all the other places that I can't think
of right now. But yeah, so super exciting. This

99
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:22,009
one starts bringing in some of the other members
of Vox Machina who didn't show up in the first

100
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,428
issue. So take a look at it, hope you guys enjoy.

101
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:28,903
Let's see. Other quick announcements. Wednesday
Club, Taliesin, you have coming up?

102
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:34,862
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's October, so we're doing
Halloween. We're doing Hellboy, which I don't

103
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:40,715
really know much about. I couldn't think of
anybody who knew a lot about Hellboy. Do you know

104
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,780
a lot about Hellboy?

105
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,235
LIAM: I know a <i>lot</i> about Hellboy.

106
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,127
TALIESIN: Do you want to come on Wednesday Club?

107
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:52,328
LIAM: Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic
<i>today</i>! Another black compendium book to go with

108
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:55,163
my other big black blades on my shelf.

109
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:58,107
MATT: Liam likes things that are big and black.

110
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:02,512
LAURA: I'm glad your mind went there, too.

111
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:06,385
TALIESIN: It's going to be Wednesday Club on
Hellboy.

112
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,063
MATT: Then you have something on Friday, as well?

113
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:12,397
TALIESIN: I do! I've decided it would be really
funny to be here really late three days in a row

114
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:19,177
for the rest of my life, and so I'm-- I don't want
to quite say "taking over." Is "taking over" the word?

115
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,562
MARISHA: That's fair.

116
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:25,561
TALIESIN: I'm taking over Gather Your Party on
Friday nights now, and we're giving it a bit of a

117
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,916
revamp. It's going to be a bit of a different
vibe. It's going to be a little shorter. It's

118
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,190
going to be fun. Our very first episode is going
to be called Gather Your Goth, and we're going to

119
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,493
be giving some of our friends goth makeovers and
having a goth dance contest.

120
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:39,225
LAURA: Can I get made over? When are you doing
it?

121
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,263
TALIESIN: Tomorrow night.

122
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:45,245
LAURA: Shit, I'm not going to be here! Fuck, I
really want to be made over!

123
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,736
TALIESIN: Well I'll tell you what. You let me
know, and you can come over and have a goth

124
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,187
makeover.

125
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,913
MATT: Next time you do it, you do whatever it's
called, and then in parentheses Laura Your Goth,

126
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:54,189
or Goth Your Laura.

127
00:08:54,189 --> 00:09:06,267
TALIESIN: Gather Your Laura. You would goth out
very well. I think I would be excited by that.

128
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:11,611
MATT: All right. To finish this up, let's see. I
forgot to mention it last week, but those of you

129
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:17,887
guys who have been playing the Telltale Batman
game, the new Pact episode came out recently with

130
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:26,327
Harley Quinn and Bane, and I play Mr. Freeze! It's
been a lot of fun, and I've been continuously

131
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:29,747
recording on it. Hope you guys enjoy more fun to
come with that delightful character.

132
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,004
LIAM: You do have a cold heart.

133
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:36,139
MATT: It's true. Then you guys had a Sagas of
Sundry announcement?

134
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:43,150
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Sagas of Sundry announcement!
Cast list went out! Who's in it? We are!

135
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,057
LIAM: I didn't see you there at all!

136
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:49,539
MARISHA: Look again! Abigail Persimmon.

137
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,752
TALIESIN: The magic of the goth makeover strikes
again! (cackles)

138
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,512
MARISHA: I'm not coming tomorrow because I've
already had mine.

139
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,519
TALIESIN: No, I bought this shirt when we went
shopping.

140
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,548
MARISHA: That's right! You did! We went on a
shopping trip, and we had so much fun.

141
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:08,209
LIAM: It was fucking wild.

142
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,229
MARISHA: Anyone who hasn't seen any of the first
season--

143
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,045
MATT: Thanks for keeping tally.

144
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:22,572
TRAVIS: He picked his cup up without drinking it
again! Picks it up. (thunk)

145
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:24,682
LIAM: Like an animatronic sailor!

146
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:31,522
MATT: Like a raccoon that can't find a river, I go
through the motions of washing my food. All right.

147
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:39,036
Couple of other things. It is still Sub-tober,
because why not? That means if you haven't had the

148
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:43,643
opportunity to subscribe to any of the Twitch
streams that you're a fan of, you can do so half

149
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:49,808
off until the 18th. So you can do that up until
the 18th and then get the comic the same day, I guess.

150
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:54,545
And since this is the final episode of the
campaign, I wanted to give a shout out to all our

151
00:10:54,545 --> 00:11:01,255
fantastic crew. Wonderful people who have worked
their ass off to stay here late every Thursday. We

152
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:07,365
have Maxwell James, Dani Carr, Jason Corey, Ryan
Green, Selina Ruth, Chris Wilmont, Zach Wilson,

153
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:15,813
Sax Carr, Mark Donica, Anthony Videsco, Courtney
Kraft, Ian Kagihara, Chris Lockey, Holly Pearson,

154
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:24,392
Ryan Porter, Denise, J. Andrew Bernard, Ed Lopez,
Rachel Romero, all of our fantastic mods who have

155
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:29,726
done an incredible job maintaining the chaos that
is Twitch, you guys are fantastic. We really

156
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:32,663
appreciate all the hard work you guys put into it,
and many, many more. The entire community, we

157
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,066
can't even begin to express--

158
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,395
LAURA: Did you say Fernando?

159
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,536
MATT: Yes, I did. Wait, Fernando. Someone didn't
put Fernando on the list!

160
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:43,033
SAM: And many more whose names were omitted.

161
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:48,025
MATT: Correct, thank you guys so much for all your
hard work!

162
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:52,189
LIAM: Wait, let's come up with some more
announcements so we never have to start.

163
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:59,110
MATT: Nope, I think we've stretched the audience's
patience enough. Let's go ahead and dive in to

164
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,089
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

165
00:12:04,089 --> 00:13:35,087
[dramatic music]

166
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,200
LIAM: Autoerotic a-pixie-ation.

167
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,164
MATT: You were real late on the draw, but this is
the night to do it. I guess.

168
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:43,406
LIAM: Right on time.

169
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:51,830
MATT: It was perfect. Precisely when you mean to.
All right. Last we left off, Vox Machina, through

170
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,075
their trials and tribulations, had eventually come
to realize the machinations of Vecna, who ascended

171
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:04,205
into godhood, transported his city from the
Shadowfell of Thar Amphala to the top, right above

172
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:11,796
a long-dead earth primordial titan, rising it and
making its way toward Vasselheim, the Dawn City,

173
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:13,718
the beginning of creation.

174
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:18,745
You battled your way through its innards, up
within the arcane dome that protected it, managed

175
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:25,926
to defeat one half of the long-frustrating
Briarwood coupling, fought your way to the top of

176
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:34,387
the tower Entropis, did battle with Vecna, the
Ascended. Through careful planning and sacrifices,

177
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:44,219
you managed to apply the trammels, complete the
sealing ritual, and send Vecna screaming across

178
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:51,763
the Divine Gate, to be sealed to wherever his
divine demi-plane resides on the other side.

179
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:58,065
As you all fell down upon the ruined, floating
platforms of the tower Entropis, you glanced over

180
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:04,498
as your recent ally, Arkhan the Cruel, proceeded
to sever his own hand, attach the Hand of Vecna,

181
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:15,944
and catching you off guard, transport himself
beyond your current reach. This beat of intensity

182
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:22,682
releasing slowly, the adrenaline still wearing its
way through your veins, you sit in silence,

183
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:28,079
looking about, amazed that you all still stand
after such a confrontation.

184
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,401
It's at that moment you hear this distant
explosion. Glancing off the side of the platform

185
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:42,718
you're on, you can still see, while the large
titan, one of four arms raised, attempting to come

186
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:49,455
and destroy all of you with one large blow, frozen
in place, there still remains the dregs of Vecna's

187
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:54,624
army down below throughout the city of Vasselheim,
where battles are still raging in the streets. You

188
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:59,491
can still see wyvern-riders and eagle-riders in
the sky, though it appears that the gloomstalkers

189
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:05,358
that once paraded across the skies over the city
have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of

190
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:14,274
the ascended god that summoned them. You also
still are aware of the body of your sister,

191
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:23,847
residing on the platforms below. It's at this
point that you notice that the green tendrils of

192
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:32,196
energy that hold the Tower of Entropis together
begin to flicker and subside. The platforms that

193
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:36,688
were slowly drifting, listing, suddenly begin to
shift.

194
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:40,836
LAURA: No! I take off on my broom, and I go down
to try to get her.

195
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:44,992
MATT: Okay. You guys dart over the side. What are
the rest of you guys doing?

196
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:48,948
TRAVIS: I had the immovable rod pulled out, and I
click it where I am.

197
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:53,796
MATT: All right. You hold in place. You feel the
platform give beneath you. Your toes are now

198
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:59,076
dangling in the middle of the air as you watch the
cracked-open right side of Entropis' peak begin to

199
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:02,443
topple and fall beneath you. What are you guys
doing?

200
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:05,698
MARISHA: I'm still a planetar. Do you still have
Bigby's Hand up?

201
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:08,433
SAM: For maybe 30 seconds more.

202
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,487
TALIESIN: Where's the carpet?

203
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,627
TRAVIS: It's in my bag.

204
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:17,396
MARISHA: I do a potato sack hold on Scanlan. Make
sure he's all right.

205
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:20,254
MATT: You grab him. Pike still has some time. She
still has her wings.

206
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,718
TRAVIS: I can throw it to you.

207
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,404
TALIESIN: That would be nice. Yes, please.

208
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:32,118
TRAVIS: Can I pull the carpet out of the bag of
holding? Do you want to free fall and go after it?

209
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:36,449
MATT: By the way, the platform is now giving
underneath you.

210
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,463
SAM: Why don't you fly it over?

211
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:43,123
TRAVIS: I don't think I can be on it with him.
Right? I'm still enlarged.

212
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,985
MARISHA: Here, can one of us fly over and get it?

213
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:56,114
LAURA: Technically, he was on the broom with me,
so I could've dropped him off with one of you

214
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,726
before I flew down to Velora.

215
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:03,711
MATT: As you're having this conversation about the
carpet, you're dragged down over the side as the

216
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:08,749
broom rockets off, Vex's mind currently focused
more on other things. So the last thing you hear

217
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:13,086
from Percival is, "Could you throw--" as he darts
off to the side. The platform is beginning to give

218
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:18,654
as the flickering green energy begins to fade. You
guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the

219
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:24,959
rubble, where the top staircase had broken apart
from the original sundering of the top of the

220
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:30,632
tower. There you see, still lying there, lifeless,
the body of Velora. You rush in there just as the

221
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:36,140
platform's collapsing. I need you both to make
acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you

222
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,780
can maneuver in and out.

223
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,484
LAURA: Okay, it's 30.

224
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:42,831
LIAM: 31.

225
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:48,483
MATT: Both of you guys rush inward. As some of the
various chunks are beginning to fall and separate

226
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:53,867
from underneath the platforms, you begin to dart
through, dodge, and you grab and lift her body.

227
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:58,629
Both of you cradling her, and at a moment's notice,
deciding which one of you's going to take her.

228
00:18:58,629 --> 00:18:59,912
LIAM: I've got her.

229
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:03,099
MATT: All right. Vax, you go ahead and dart off.
You careen back out of the way as the central,

230
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:08,538
large platform crashes down with a heavy impact.
You can see it crumble, then break, and three

231
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:12,079
separate pieces beginning to tumble. The tower
then gives in from underneath and begins to

232
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,747
collapse downward, almost like a controlled
demolition. As it begins to fall and topple down

233
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:22,956
below, you all gather your thoughts and consider
other allies that were recently--

234
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,366
TRAVIS: Falling?

235
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,144
MATT: A short time ago, yes.

236
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,741
LAURA: Zahra and Kash?

237
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:36,376
MARISHA: With Scanlan in hand, start diving down
to go see if I can find them or have any sight of

238
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,624
them at all.

239
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:39,152
MATT: What's the flying speed of your planetar?

240
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:40,476
MARISHA: 150 feet.

241
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:45,871
MATT: Okay. As you, holding Scanlan under your arm,
coast down at a speed to the point where now

242
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:50,857
you're actually racing the crumbling of the tower.
You're watching the actual cracks as they emerge,

243
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:55,168
as the energy's dissipating, beginning to subside,
as your speed overtakes the rate in which it's

244
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,205
collapsing.

245
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,738
MARISHA: Like Superman and Lois Lane.

246
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:04,669
MATT: (laughter). The G's are intense, Scanlan.
Your eyes are watering, blown back on your face.

247
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:11,477
The Ioun symbol on your forehead is flaring like a
spotlight ahead of you. As you rocket down, you

248
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:16,764
glance, you can see there across the rocks at the
bottom, two wyverns that are scattered across the

249
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:22,668
rubble, and you see, lying there, the bodies of
Kashaw and Zahra.

250
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:26,111
SAM: They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back.
They're dead.

251
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,560
MARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan! Are they dead?

252
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,110
MATT: Make a perception check.

253
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,708
TRAVIS: How high am I hanging off of this thing?

254
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,760
MATT: Make--

255
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,321
TRAVIS: A perception check? I am a million--
eight.

256
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:44,885
MATT: You're high up there. That's a long way up.

257
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,479
MARISHA: 18.

258
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:51,378
LAURA: You can use the carpet because Percy's on
the broom with me.

259
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,554
MATT: Their bodies are brutalized from the impact.
They hit.

260
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,187
MARISHA: They're splatted.

261
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,987
MATT: Well, they're not splatted.

262
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:01,360
LAURA: They're not you on the cliff.

263
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,667
MARISHA: Sure. They didn't goldfish it.

264
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,529
TRAVIS: But a good Revivify might help.

265
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,728
SAM: They're unconscious?

266
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,901
MATT: You're just now approaching. As you get
there, you can hear the rumbling of the tower

267
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,267
getting louder. You've barely beaten it. What are
you doing?

268
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:28,117
MARISHA: I've got to move them, right? Is that
what you're saying? Scanlan? You're fine, right?

269
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,635
Handle yourself?

270
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:34,247
MATT: Scanlan, she sets you on the ground as you
look over and see the tower (crashing).

271
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:37,928
MARISHA: Do you want to hold onto my back?

272
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,702
SAM: I have no spells left, so yes.

273
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:43,444
(laughter)

274
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:45,670
SAM: I will climb on.

275
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,740
TALIESIN: I imagine Scanlan dropping that last
potion as it's coming down.

276
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:58,723
MATT: Okay. As you dive on, you grab both of their
limp bodies and pull them under your arms and dart.

277
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,862
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
please.

278
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,111
LAURA: Oh my god, if we thought we made it out of
this--

279
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:09,423
MARISHA: Okay, 18. No, wait! Yeah, 18.

280
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:19,471
MATT: 18. You manage to scoot by as one of the
large chunks of the base falls over to one side,

281
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,812
and as you dart out, wings before you, Scanlan
clutched on your back, both their bodies beneath,

282
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:29,290
you can feel the gust of wind from behind as the
collapsing wall is pushing all the air in your

283
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:36,103
direction. As you focus down, your wings out, you
manage to careen underneath as the shadow that was

284
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:41,109
beginning to fall over you pulls behind, and
behind you hear the (boom), the dust pick up, and

285
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,167
you guys all look down and watch as the tower
finally falls to its final piece of rubble there

286
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:50,881
on the ground. At which point you glance down, and
you can see both of them, their eyes roll open,

287
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:57,446
lolling in their face, both Zahra and Kashaw,
seemingly conscious. If you guys want to step in?

288
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:04,553
(cheering)

289
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:09,310
MARISHA: I'm going to immediately burn two of my
healing touches, and you get 6d8 plus three hit

290
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,895
points back.

291
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:27,206
MATT: Kashaw and Zahra, you've been lying there on
the ground for a moment going, "Ow," and as your

292
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:33,814
vision focuses, you watch as the tower begins to
collapse downward in your direction. The shadow

293
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,700
seems to close over you.

294
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,629
WILL: Well, that's not good.

295
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,768
MARISHA: 29 hit points to both of you
immediately.

296
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:46,821
MATT: And with a flash, something white-feathered
and blue shoots past you, grabs you, and you are

297
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:52,250
thrust into the air, carried by the angelic form
of Keyleth.

298
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,696
MARY: Kiki? How are you, darling?

299
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:04,385
MARISHA: Did you recognize me because of the
antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very

300
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,621
identifying.

301
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,057
MARY: I think I dreamed of you.

302
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:16,380
MARISHA: No, that was real and incredible, and you
all showed up.

303
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,346
SAM: Why did you come?

304
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,593
WILL: We had to come. She made us.

305
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:23,812
(laughter)

306
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,366
MARY: I had a vision.

307
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:27,129
WILL: It's good to see you. Thank you for that.

308
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,500
SAM: You had a vision?

309
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,406
MARY: I did. I had a vision of white wings, and
blue--

310
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,786
WILL: Are you okay?

311
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:37,307
MARY: I think we're all right.

312
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:39,139
WILL: Both of you?

313
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:40,547
MARY: Yeah.

314
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,893
WILL: Don't piss off a pregnant tiefling.

315
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:46,871
MARISHA: Yeah-- wait, what?

316
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:52,559
WILL: Thank gods for that.

317
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,358
SAM: Haven't you heard of pulling out?

318
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:59,520
(laughter)

319
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,191
SAM: I do it all the time!

320
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:04,618
WILL: I tried. Didn't work.

321
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:07,232
MARY: I wouldn't let him.

322
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:11,292
WILL: The tail held me in place.

323
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:15,413
MARY: You always said you liked that.

324
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:22,064
WILL: Can you put us down somewhere, maybe?

325
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:24,698
MARY: That would be lovely, thank you.

326
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:28,581
MARISHA: I drop Kash, but very lightly set down
Zahra.

327
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,283
MATT: You tumble.

328
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:31,942
MARISHA: Congratulations!

329
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:33,407
MARY: Did we win?

330
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,100
MATT: No, you're healed up; you're fine. The Death
Ward brought you guys to one hit point, and then

331
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,158
she healed you before she dropped you, so you're
fine.

332
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:45,237
WILL: No, I deserved that. Thank you. So did we
win? What happened?

333
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,462
SAM: We're sitting on the titan now?

334
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,281
MATT: You're down in the street level of Thar
Amphala.

335
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:52,055
SAM: But still on the Titan?

336
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:53,369
MATT: Still on the top of the Titan.

337
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,808
SAM: Is he falling?

338
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:56,598
MATT: Make a perception check.

339
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,242
SAM: Two.

340
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:01,449
MATT: You have no idea.

341
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:06,540
SAM: Pregnant?! What? I thought you were gay!

342
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,313
WILL: We've talked about this. It's all right.

343
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:16,455
TRAVIS: Can I take out the carpet and start making
my enlarged form way down to them? By myself?

344
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:18,446
LAURA: Well, Pike's with you.

345
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,857
TRAVIS: Oh. Is she?

346
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:21,371
LAURA: Yeah, Pike's still with you up there.

347
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,735
TRAVIS: She's got wings.

348
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:27,728
MATT: With a strength of 19, and your enlarged
size--

349
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:29,843
TRAVIS: Can I dispel the enlarged?

350
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:31,480
MATT: No.

351
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,698
TRAVIS: Oh, it's in for ten minutes. I'm just me.

352
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:37,092
(laughter)

353
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:42,804
MATT: You get the sense, at this size, that carpet
cannot carry you.

354
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:50,947
TRAVIS: I'm just hanging out. I grab the earring
and I say: Will someone please do me a favor? Will

355
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:55,494
you look for Arkhan's hand? Find me that hand.

356
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:58,960
SAM: Is it falling?

357
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,000
MATT: It was on one of the platforms.

358
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,438
MARISHA: Wait, you want to find his hand on the
giant tower full of rubble?

359
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,955
WILL: Whose hand?

360
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:10,117
TRAVIS: Arkhan's.

361
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,848
LIAM: Vex or I can find it.

362
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:14,128
LAURA: In a moment.

363
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:19,352
MATT: At this point, you have both come down now
to the base of the tower. At that speed, it took

364
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:21,605
you a while to catch up to the rest of everybody
else.

365
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:29,699
MARISHA: I look up and say: Grog, do you need a
hand? Are you all right? Damn it, the pun wasn't

366
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,062
intended, Scanlan!

367
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:33,345
(laughter)

368
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:38,142
TRAVIS: I literally just said that.

369
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:44,425
MARISHA: Do you need assistance getting down from
hanging from a bar? In the middle of the air, to

370
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:46,009
be very literal.

371
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,198
TRAVIS: Yeah, it would be nice.

372
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,869
MARISHA: I fly up.

373
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,017
MATT: So your angelic wing maneuver.

374
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:54,806
MARY: I can cast Fly on him.

375
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,459
SAM: Yeah, do that! Zahra has Fly, she can cast
Fly on him!

376
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,317
MARY: I cast Fly on Grog.

377
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:01,626
MATT: Okay. You'll have to get up a little closer
to do it, because you're out of range.

378
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:06,917
MARY: Can I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly up and
then cast?

379
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,345
MATT: Yeah.

380
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,544
MARY: I fly up and I cast. Hello, darling!

381
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:15,948
MATT: You watch as Zahra, suddenly her cloak
extends into two large, leathery bat wings and she

382
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:21,473
flies her way up pretty close to where you are.
For a second there, you glance down. Roll a

383
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,817
perception check.

384
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,270
TRAVIS: Ten.

385
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,356
MATT: You see a gloomstalker coming right at you.

386
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:29,021
TRAVIS: (screams)

387
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,867
MATT: As you hold the sword out in front, you
notice in a second, it's Zahra.

388
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:35,121
TRAVIS: Oh. Not a gloomstalker.

389
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:40,493
MATT: But the sword, at this point, as you hold it
out in front of you and push back, it goes, "One

390
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:50,198
"part is done. Well played. But he still survives.
We'll take him. And we'll take that dragon. The

391
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:54,957
"hand must be destroyed. It's still out there.
Together--"

392
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:57,330
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, I sheathe him.

393
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,575
(laughter)

394
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,049
TRAVIS: I need some Visine bad.

395
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:06,780
MARY: Grog! Hello, darling.

396
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,179
TRAVIS: Hey, Zahra.

397
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,059
MARY: Did you ever use that moonhammer I gave
you?

398
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,004
TRAVIS: All the time. Covered in blood.

399
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,942
MARY: Right. In the moonlight, right?

400
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:16,519
TRAVIS: Yep. Need to get it cleaned.

401
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,895
MARY: Good. Well, I look forward to hearing your
tales. Do you need some help, my darling?

402
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:24,919
TRAVIS: I do, unless you just want to hang out
with me up here for a bit.

403
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:31,286
MARY: Well, I could. How is your arm? You know
what, no, let's just do it. I cast Fly. Let go.

404
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:34,600
MATT: And you can fly. You're gliding in the air.

405
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,206
(laughter)

406
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:39,501
MATT: He starts slowly--

407
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,514
TALIESIN, LAURA, and MARISHA: Don't leave the
rod!

408
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,497
TRAVIS: How do I do this?

409
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:55,627
MARY: It's all right. Just focus. Focus. You'll be
fine, Grog. Just focus. Yes, think of yourself as

410
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,142
a cow. As a flying cow. You remember?

411
00:29:58,142 --> 00:30:02,799
TRAVIS: Moo.

412
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,138
LAURA: Grab the rod.

413
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:09,447
TRAVIS: Oh, right. (click) Put it back in the bag
of holding. This is great! Oh my god, I would do

414
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:10,790
this every day.

415
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,845
MARY: Well, you could do it for at least an hour,
so that's good.

416
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,158
TRAVIS: Can I drunkenly fly down to everybody
else?

417
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:23,477
MATT: And you do, it's a slow spiral, and you
begin to gimbal backward, and she has to right you

418
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:24,607
a couple times.

419
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:27,027
TRAVIS: Can I fly right as I get closer, just for
dramatic effect?

420
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:33,337
MARY: Focus on me. No squirrel. There's no
squirrels. Focus your mind. No. It's all right,

421
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:36,809
just come down. (singing)

422
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,639
TRAVIS: I come down!

423
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,767
MARY: All right, you could do that, too. Look out
below!

424
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:44,356
TRAVIS: Three-point landing. Super hard.

425
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,636
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

426
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,719
TRAVIS: Super hard.

427
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,954
WILL: Superhero landing.

428
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:50,723
TRAVIS: (high voice) Not great.

429
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,667
TALIESIN: Yay!

430
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,494
LAURA: Not bad.

431
00:30:52,494 --> 00:30:54,062
TRAVIS: Oh, not bad, yeah. Yeah. 14.

432
00:30:54,062 --> 00:31:09,247
MATT: 14. Okay. You were rage-hanging? You take 24
points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 12.

433
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:10,919
LAURA: And Grog is dead.

434
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,890
MATT: And three-point landing. You watch as a
crater is left beneath where his impact is. The

435
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,512
smoke slowly subsides, and Grog's there, fist in
the ground, Thor: Ragnarok style.

436
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:24,297
LAURA: And we're all on the ground now?

437
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:27,547
MATT: You are all now on the ground floor of Thar
Amphala. As you glance around--

438
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:31,830
LIAM: I'm flexing the wings out and around, and
I'm making a feather bed with the ends of the

439
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,181
wings on the ground and laying Velora down on it.

440
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:37,042
LAURA: Kash, tell me you have Revivify. Tell me
you can bring her back.

441
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,748
WILL: I believe I do.

442
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:43,134
LIAM: I start combing her hair with my fingers,
out of her eyes.

443
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:48,212
WILL: Let me check. I do. Who am I casting it on?

444
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:50,270
LAURA: Our sister.

445
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,709
WILL: Oh. Oh, that doesn't look good. Yeah, okay.
Let's see what we can do. I'm sorry, I'm still a

446
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:56,800
little sore.

447
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,635
LAURA: No. It's terrible. Please help her.

448
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:00,327
WILL: It was a terrible fall. Give me one second.

449
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,207
MARY: I'm so sorry.

450
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:08,022
WILL: Oh. Her? This one? Yeah, all right. Let's do
that. I'm going to cast Revivify.

451
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:14,424
MATT: Okay. Unfortunately, she's been dead longer
than a minute, so the spell does not take effect.

452
00:32:14,424 --> 00:32:20,755
You don't know how long it's been, or if perhaps
your final moments of fucking with her was just

453
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,190
enough to push it over the edge--

454
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,168
(laughter)

455
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:25,793
WILL: It keeps happening! Sorry.

456
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:27,722
SAM: 61 seconds.

457
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:30,172
WILL: I can speak to dead, if you'd like to talk
with her.

458
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:32,915
LAURA: No! I don't want to fucking talk to her, I
want to have her back!

459
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:34,583
(laughter)

460
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,620
WILL: It's time for one message. Does she owe you
money? I can have her find out where it is.

461
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,023
LIAM: Do you have anything a little more potent
right now?

462
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:42,743
MARISHA: I can raise dead.

463
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,493
WILL: Well, there we go. See?

464
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:45,754
LAURA: Is she going to come back as a zombie?

465
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:46,709
MARISHA: No.

466
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,717
LAURA: She'll be a normal--

467
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,816
TALIESIN: Just raised.

468
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,609
MARISHA: I might need some help. Where's Pike?

469
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,219
WILL: I can raise the dead, too, if you need
help.

470
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,117
MATT: Pike has been slowly flying down.

471
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,404
MARISHA: She doesn't come back as a zombie, right?
It's raising dead.

472
00:32:56,404 --> 00:33:00,092
MATT: Is it the actual Raise Dead spell?

473
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:01,523
WILL: Mine is.

474
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:05,464
MARISHA: It says three times a day.

475
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:10,990
MATT: Raise Dead. You can bring someone back to
life, yeah. It takes an hour to cast.

476
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,969
MARISHA: Yep.

477
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:15,575
TRAVIS: Do they murder someone when you do that,
like a horror movie?

478
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:18,013
MARISHA: If I did it with Kash, would that--

479
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:24,267
WILL: I'm with Zahra now, so let's try to keep
that in mind.

480
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,924
TALIESIN: Wow, two for two tonight.

481
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:27,844
MARISHA: I don't know how to respond to that.

482
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:30,506
LIAM: Your sense of humor is your best quality.

483
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:31,698
WILL: Isn't it?

484
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:32,562
LIAM: Best.

485
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:33,910
WILL: We'll get her. She'll be fine!

486
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:40,543
MATT: As you guys take a moment and realize the
time, the involvement that would be here to do the

487
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:45,770
spell, you glance about in the streets of Thar
Amphala, and what straggling undead and/or

488
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,498
cultists seem to have been either trying to
scramble back up to the city or hadn't made their

489
00:33:49,498 --> 00:33:56,747
way down through or were here as sentinels are
frantically trying to escape and being cut down

490
00:33:56,747 --> 00:34:02,283
and grabbed by the various eagle riders and the
rest of the army that's currently now beginning to

491
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:08,312
swarm in, thanks to the complete falling of the
barrier with the sealing of Vecna. You do feel at

492
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,507
this moment that you do have some time in Thar
Amphala without any immediate danger.

493
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:16,628
WILL: But if it gets to that, I can stay and raise
her, and you guys can go and take care of the city.

494
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:18,419
LAURA: Thank you.

495
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:23,848
MARISHA: I don't even know if I have a full hour
left on my form. That's the only problem. That's

496
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,158
why I would need help, but--

497
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:27,063
WILL: She needs to rest, anyway.

498
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:29,015
MARY: I can stay. I'll stay with him.

499
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,004
LAURA: Thank you.

500
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,541
MARY: We'll focus on her.

501
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,871
SAM: We'll all stay, until we don't have to.

502
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,952
LAURA: Yeah.

503
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:35,627
MARISHA: I help Kash as much as I can.

504
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:36,529
MATT: Okay.

505
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:37,717
LAURA: I sit down and hold her hand.

506
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:38,758
MATT: All right.

507
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:42,123
LIAM: Start cleaning her cheeks as well as we
can.

508
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,508
MARISHA: And I don't take my eyes off of Vax the
whole time.

509
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,142
SAM: Oh, yeah. Shit.

510
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:50,194
WILL: I'm holding my medal. Starting the spell.

511
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:56,675
MATT: As you guys form a perimeter here at the
base of Entropis, the sky now open, the clouds

512
00:34:56,675 --> 00:35:01,490
dispelled and scattered, and probably for the
first time in weeks, especially from your guys'

513
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:08,105
perspective, Vasselheim sees a sky of blue. The
sunlight rains down from above, and the warmth

514
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:14,305
that comes through is very comforting as you begin
to clear the space and scrawl out the sigils and

515
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:22,564
glyphs necessary for this Raise Dead ritual. As
you're going through the process and you quietly

516
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:30,108
begin to focus, you can see some of the eagle
riders and straggling wyvern riders take notice

517
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:36,801
and begin to come close, and then stop and keep a
distance, and recognizing the significance of this

518
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,121
moment, respectfully stay away.

519
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:44,081
WILL: As he's casting the glyphs, he goes over,
he's about to write the last one, and he walks

520
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:50,497
over to Vex, and he takes one tear, and he goes
back over and uses it to do the last glyph.

521
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:56,462
MATT: As he draws the last glyph with the tear,
that one seems to have an additional flair, a

522
00:35:56,462 --> 00:36:03,360
connection, a sparkle of bloodline connectivity
between you and the deceased. As you complete the

523
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,386
spell, I need you to go ahead and bring to this
ritual what you'd like.

524
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:13,483
SAM: Oh god.

525
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:29,339
LAURA: Jesus, really? Oh, god. I take one of my
arrows that has the owlbear feather on it, and I

526
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,995
put it down next to her because I know she loved
owlbears.

527
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:55,017
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me. Okay.
Anybody else?

528
00:36:55,017 --> 00:37:09,860
LIAM: I pull Simon from around my waist, and I
start to fasten it around her. This is yours.

529
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,417
You're going to have to take care of him now. His
name is Simon. Most people don't think he's alive,

530
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:29,734
but they're wrong. He's very much alive. Take care
of him for me. I didn't get nearly enough time

531
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:38,029
with you. I'm sorry. I love you very much. I kiss
her on the forehead.

532
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,410
MATT: Roll another d20.

533
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:48,102
LIAM: I rolled an 18, but I'm going to use Luck.
Good. 18 is good.

534
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,536
MATT: Okay.

535
00:37:49,536 --> 00:38:02,449
MARY: I take the moonstone from my staff, and I
clasp it in my hands, and I say: Sirius, you asked

536
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:14,878
me to be here and to judge them. They are worthy.
Give me this boon. Help me save this girl, for

537
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:26,739
true friendship, which I never had until now. Help
me save her. Help us all save her. And I place the

538
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,159
moonstone down next to her head.

539
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,199
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

540
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,559
MARY: I'll use Luck.

541
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,461
MATT: If you want to.

542
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,928
MARY: 12.

543
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:50,412
MATT: Okay. As you complete the ritual, all the
sigils in place lighting up, it's unique because

544
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:56,308
you're used to the ritual completed by an acolyte
of Sarenrae, in which everything has a glow of

545
00:38:56,308 --> 00:39:01,839
warmth to it. This ritual was completed by an
acolyte of an entity named Vesh, and as each sigil

546
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,570
flares, you watch as they darken into the deepest
shadow. It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell

547
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:13,526
begins to take effect, until eventually the whole
circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of

548
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:20,573
lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as
Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and

549
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:33,510
disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear
she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away

550
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:40,511
like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the
subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling,

551
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:48,081
you watch as her chest begins to move once more,
breathing, her eyes still closed, but life

552
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:53,004
breathes into her lungs once more. With a natural
19.

553
00:39:53,004 --> 00:40:06,103
LAURA: I hug her. Oh, and I pop Trinket out of his
necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him so he can

554
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,487
lick her face.

555
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:12,763
MATT: Okay. As Trinket comes out, Trinket is
burned and battered, armor dinged up and screwed

556
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:15,707
up, on his face it's askew to one side--

557
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:16,933
TRAVIS: He got meteored.

558
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:17,974
(laughter)

559
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:19,377
MATT: Yeah, he did.

560
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,854
TRAVIS: I didn't sign up for this shit.

561
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:22,718
LAURA: I've still got a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on
him.

562
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:24,137
MATT: All right.

563
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:27,041
MARY: I cast Beast Speak. You all right, Trinket?

564
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:33,491
MATT: "I don't care." And Trinket comes forward to
Velora and begins licking her face, and she who is

565
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:40,970
breathing but unconscious, the eye begins to
slowly open. "What?" And her eyes open up a little

566
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:47,065
bit, and you can see her skin darkened from the
blast and the rubble and the dust that's now begun

567
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:52,373
to settle around the base of Entropis, and she
looks up and first sees the lapping tongue of

568
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:56,843
Trinket against her cheek, and giggles and pushes
him away a little bit. Then she sees the feather

569
00:40:56,843 --> 00:41:00,896
and looks at it and now looks up to see the person
that's holding her and looks and meets both of

570
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:03,699
your gazes--

571
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:06,125
LAURA: Hi, little monkey.

572
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,341
MATT: "Hi."

573
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:12,873
LIAM: You're an awfully long way from home.

574
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,672
MATT: "What happened?"

575
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:18,266
LAURA: You went on an adventure, that's all.

576
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:28,966
MATT: She gets quiet for a second, trying to
remember, trying to recall. "I'm very tired."

577
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,965
LAURA: Of course.

578
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:35,317
MATT: And she curls up and pulls tighter around
Vex's neck.

579
00:41:35,317 --> 00:41:38,883
WILL: Kash steps in. You don't feel evil, do you?

580
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:41,490
(laughter)

581
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:47,441
MATT: She pulls back and looks over at you. "Who's
this human?"

582
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:51,730
LAURA: Oh, he saved your life just now, dear.

583
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,371
LIAM: He's a friend. Come here.

584
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:55,311
WILL: All right.

585
00:41:55,311 --> 00:42:00,059
LAURA: No, but seriously, could she be evil?
Seriously.

586
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,314
WILL: No, there's-- no. You feel okay?

587
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:09,227
MATT: She arranges the situation and looks back at
you and goes, (giggles).

588
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,965
WILL: She's fine. I'd watch her.

589
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,149
LAURA: Yeah. She's fine.

590
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:16,115
(laughter)

591
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:21,191
MATT: She pulls back into you and whispers in your
ear and says, "He's pretty stupid, isn't he?"

592
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:23,717
LAURA: He's really stupid.

593
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:26,257
MATT: She giggles and then sighs into you.

594
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:34,688
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Just rest. I'm going to sit her
on top of Trinket so she can take a little

595
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,763
nappy-nap.

596
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:40,064
MATT: Okay. And she passes right out. She is
spent. She is exhausted.

597
00:42:40,064 --> 00:42:46,679
WILL: The city is still burning.

598
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,072
MARY: Yes, it is. We have work to do.

599
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:52,273
WILL: We've got a lot of people down there we
know.

600
00:42:52,273 --> 00:43:00,252
MARY: I know. The Slayer's Take is in desperate
need. We should check on the sphinx.

601
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:03,849
TRAVIS: The sphinx, right.

602
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,203
LAURA: We can't thank you enough. Again.

603
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:12,202
WILL: You guys always do throw the best parties,
that's for sure.

604
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:13,228
MARY: Yes, you do.

605
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:14,561
LAURA: I'm so glad you're all right.

606
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:19,281
WILL: Yeah, I'm glad we could help. That's why
we're going to name our child Vax.

607
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:22,168
I'm totally kidding; that's never going to happen.

608
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:25,145
(laughter)

609
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:37,832
MARY: Take the moonstone. Keep it with you. If you
need me-- well, I won't come, because I'll be

610
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:38,912
away, but--

611
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:41,138
LAURA: Yeah, you'll be a little busy with the
child and all.

612
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:45,372
MARY: A little busy, yes. But come and visit if
you get a chance. Who knows? Twins runs in my

613
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,089
family, so you never know.

614
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:48,560
LAURA: Really?

615
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,853
MARY: Yes. Lillith told me. I need to see Lillith
again.

616
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:53,305
LIAM: Oh, the joke's on you.

617
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:54,781
LAURA: I give her a big hug.

618
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:55,785
MARY: I love you, darling.

619
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:57,116
LAURA: I love you so much. Congratulations.

620
00:43:57,116 --> 00:44:00,667
MARY: Thank you, dearest. Scanlan.

621
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:01,845
SAM: Yes?

622
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:02,943
MARY: You little bastard.

623
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,771
SAM: Yes? That is my full name, yes.

624
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:07,878
(laughter)

625
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:13,474
MARY: I plant a giant, fiery kiss on him, and my
tail wraps around his head.

626
00:44:13,474 --> 00:44:14,730
SAM: I try to get away, but--

627
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,027
MARY: The tail.

628
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:17,581
(laughter)

629
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,579
WILL: I told you.

630
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:25,105
SAM: You're right! Kinky. Ooh! What? I mean, thank
you?

631
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:26,970
MARY: I miss doing your hair.

632
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,911
SAM: Well, I miss doing, well--

633
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:37,251
MARY: We'll see each other, again, I hope. Grog.

634
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:38,043
TRAVIS: Yeah?

635
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:40,331
MARY: Use that moonhammer.

636
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:41,579
TRAVIS: I will-- I mean, again.

637
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,740
LAURA: At night. In the night.

638
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,632
MARY: Use it in the moon--

639
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:44,487
TRAVIS: Yeah. Under the moon.

640
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:45,357
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

641
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:47,088
TRAVIS: It's called a moonhammer. Yeah.

642
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,745
MARY: Use it in the moonlight. I think you'll be
surprised.

643
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:49,919
TRAVIS: In the nude.

644
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,311
TALIESIN and MARY: Without pants.

645
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:55,613
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. Moon for moon, as above, so
below--

646
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:56,704
MARY: Yes.

647
00:44:56,704 --> 00:44:58,114
TRAVIS: And that will unleash--

648
00:44:58,114 --> 00:44:59,808
MARY: Take your pants off, here we go.

649
00:44:59,808 --> 00:45:02,623
LIAM: Double damage on cows. Yeah.

650
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:04,306
TRAVIS: I'm going to fuck some cows up.

651
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:05,553
MARY: Yeah, you do.

652
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:08,755
WILL: Oh, Grog. I love standing next to you in
battle and hate standing next to you at the

653
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:09,591
urinal.

654
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:11,955
(laughter)

655
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:14,270
WILL: That's just the way it is, my friend. Been a
pleasure.

656
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,692
MARY: Percy.

657
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:17,602
TALIESIN: Yes?

658
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:21,645
MARY: Take care of our girl.

659
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:22,940
TALIESIN: I'll try.

660
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,672
MARY: Take care of her.

661
00:45:24,672 --> 00:45:26,325
TALIESIN: My regards to your family.

662
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:31,481
MARY: Thank you, love. We'll be in Whitestone
again soon. I'll see you soon, dearest.

663
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:38,054
SAM: Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever
you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just--

664
00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:39,104
LAURA: Give it some time.

665
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:40,110
WILL: But we--

666
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,622
WILL and MARY: Almost.

667
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:47,899
MARY: That's the key word is <i>almost</i>, you see.
Yes. You saved our lives. We can never repay you.

668
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:50,758
TRAVIS: I believe you saved ours first by showing
up.

669
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:57,510
MARISHA: We saved each other. That's kind of what
Vox Machina's all about.

670
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,568
LIAM: This is the second time around you.

671
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:05,609
MARY: That's what we do for each other.
I love you, Vax.

672
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:07,877
LIAM: I love you, too, Mary.

673
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:10,897
MARY: Oh, baby, don't do that.

674
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:16,867
MATT: At this point, you begin to hear distant
horns echoing throughout the city streets.

675
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:33,453
Distant, emanating throughout. As you glance over,
you haven't heard these horns before. But they

676
00:46:33,453 --> 00:46:43,430
sound less like horns of warning and more like
horns of victory. Glancing down in the streets,

677
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:49,358
there are still flames and columns of smoke and you
can still see scuffles beneath. The siege weaponry

678
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:58,070
attacks against the titan have subsided and it has
not moved at all. It is locked in place, a large

679
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:05,527
statuesque-like mountain of an ancient entity now
lording over the edge of the Braving Grounds,

680
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:11,360
almost creeping upon the outskirts of the Quad
Roads towards the center of the city, leaving a

681
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:17,786
path of destruction in its wake. Most of the
Braving Grounds is in tatters but--

682
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:20,585
LAURA: I look at Percy. This would be a wonderful
place for a summer home.

683
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:22,288
(chuckles)

684
00:47:22,288 --> 00:47:25,191
WILL and MARY: We've got to go.

685
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:26,347
SAM: What? No.

686
00:47:26,347 --> 00:47:27,637
MARY: We have to leave.

687
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:28,936
WILL: They need us back.

688
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:29,864
MARY: Yeah.

689
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:31,104
LIAM: Don't be strangers, though.

690
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:32,274
MARY: We won't.

691
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:33,249
LIAM: Look in.

692
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:34,317
LAURA: Thank you, guys.

693
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:35,110
MARY: We will.

694
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,322
LIAM: Look in if you can.

695
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:37,427
MARY: We love you all so much.

696
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:38,281
TRAVIS: Thank you.

697
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:39,072
TALIESIN: Thank you, as well.

698
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:40,682
WILL: So this is what it's like to have a family,
huh?

699
00:47:40,682 --> 00:47:41,691
MARY: Yeah.

700
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:42,853
WILL: I can get used to that.

701
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:44,398
MARISHA: Sounds like you're going to have an
actual family soon.

702
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:51,939
SAM: Well I shit more than your kid will, but
other than that, it's like this but with less shit.

703
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:54,321
WILL: Then we'll be happy.

704
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,786
MARY: Always.

705
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:57,984
WILL: Call us if you need us. Anytime.

706
00:47:57,984 --> 00:47:58,728
LAURA: Same.

707
00:47:58,728 --> 00:47:59,932
MARY: We'll be here.

708
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:00,925
LAURA: All right.

709
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:01,863
MARY: Thank you.

710
00:48:01,863 --> 00:48:02,915
WILL: Luck in battle.

711
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:03,693
SAM: Thank you.

712
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:04,682
LAURA: Bye loves.

713
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:05,905
LIAM: See you later, smart ass.

714
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:06,880
MARY: Thank you.

715
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,120
WILL: Bastard. Treat her well or I'm going to come
back.

716
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,665
LAURA: Hey, you've got your hands full, all
right?

717
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:11,983
WILL: That's true, too.

718
00:48:11,983 --> 00:48:21,982
MATT: And as she completes a secondary Fly spell,
these two coast off over the edge of Thar Amphala,

719
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:36,002
down into the center of Vasselheim on their own.
At which point, you notice three battle-disheveled

720
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:42,570
wyvern riders that were waiting at the side begin
to approach. One of them you recognize as a

721
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:48,354
captain signified by these ivory horns that curl
out of the back of the helmet and grow longer than

722
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:53,114
the regular wyvern riders' armor you've
encountered. Having stepped off the armored drake

723
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:58,452
that currently waits, shaking its head, large
leathery wings dug into the nearby rubble, the

724
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:02,939
warrior approaches, pulling the helmet off,
revealing a tumble of braided amber hair with

725
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:09,672
shaved sides and a rather stern-looking woman that
you don't recognise. "Vox Machina! I am Captain

726
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:17,173
"Obelin. I would ask, does this shift in tide
signify anything? Does the lich still loom about?"

727
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:20,284
LAURA: He fucking dead.

728
00:49:20,284 --> 00:49:23,879
TALIESIN: Does not. The battle is won.

729
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,623
LAURA: He's been sealed away.

730
00:49:26,623 --> 00:49:29,007
MATT: "It is done?"

731
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,172
TRAVIS: It is.

732
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:31,591
TALIESIN: "Fucking dead."

733
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:34,034
(laughter)

734
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,479
TRAVIS: Lady Vex'ahlia.

735
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:36,865
TALIESIN: Lady, yes.

736
00:49:36,865 --> 00:49:45,778
MATT: "The gods grant their grace upon Vasselheim
still. We thank you. Well, there's little time to

737
00:49:45,778 --> 00:49:53,854
"celebrate. There's still much to be done, but
please bring this information to the Platinum

738
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:59,941
"Sanctuary, to somewhere of significance in the
city. This information needs to go out. this will

739
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:02,851
"greatly bolster the ranks, morale of those--"

740
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:06,244
MARISHA: Start spreading the word yourself. You
can help us out, right?

741
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:09,254
MATT: "Oh, we shall." She looks over her shoulder
at the other soldiers.

742
00:50:09,254 --> 00:50:12,236
TALIESIN: I've got the last flare from Whitestone
from all those years ago.

743
00:50:12,236 --> 00:50:16,493
LAURA: I have a purple flare too. We should all
set them off.

744
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:18,583
MARISHA: I was going to say: I think I still have
a Skywrite.

745
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,704
SAM: Let's do it.

746
00:50:19,704 --> 00:50:20,525
MARISHA: Yep.

747
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:21,496
LAURA: I send up my purple flare, too.

748
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:22,391
SAM: I pull out my gun.

749
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:24,017
(laughter)

750
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:25,707
TRAVIS: Yes!

751
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:26,883
MARISHA: Oh my god!

752
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:27,960
TRAVIS: I forgot you have one.

753
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,093
LIAM: What a callback.

754
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,527
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for it.

755
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,381
TRAVIS: Please misfire. Please blow your hand
off.

756
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:34,390
SAM: Let's do this. (yells)

757
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,745
(laughter)

758
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:37,848
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20.

759
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,582
TRAVIS: Please.

760
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:40,620
TALIESIN: No!

761
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,777
SAM: Natural 20.

762
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:42,611
TALIESIN: No!

763
00:50:42,611 --> 00:50:45,626
SAM: (machine gun noises)

764
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,615
LIAM: Say hello to my even littler friend!

765
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:51,932
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

766
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:57,160
MATT: So as you guys send up your colored
Whitestone crest flares into the sky, what do you

767
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,362
Skywrite?

768
00:50:58,362 --> 00:50:59,802
MARISHA: Vecna defeated.

769
00:50:59,802 --> 00:51:01,360
LAURA: That's a lot of writing.

770
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,275
TALIESIN: That's a lot of words.

771
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:03,932
MATT: The wisps of cloud begin to spell across--

772
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:05,179
SAM: V def.

773
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:08,348
MARISHA: (laughs) I can write it out.

774
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:09,642
TALIESIN: You can.

775
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:15,392
MATT: Yeah. As it coasts across, you hear this
loud echoing (gunshot) as the N in the middle of

776
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:20,164
Vecna seems to dissipate with a little puff as a
perfectly aimed bullet from one pistol that does

777
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:23,462
not backfire, because that would have been fucking
funny.

778
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,569
TALIESIN: It's all I wanted tonight.

779
00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:26,844
TRAVIS: So good.

780
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:30,005
MATT: Roll a performance check.

781
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:32,386
SAM: Performance? Come on. 28.

782
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:38,148
MATT: 28. For a man who has only shot a pistol
once, he Revolver Ocelots that shit.

783
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:40,776
LAURA: He's been practicing that shit in his
bedroom.

784
00:51:40,776 --> 00:51:42,461
MARISHA: Yeah. In the mirror.

785
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:44,330
TRAVIS: Behind the back. Oh shit.

786
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,045
(laughter)

787
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:49,979
SAM: I've been watching you.

788
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:53,145
TRAVIS: Percy's like, "I don't do that shit."

789
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:55,055
(laughter)

790
00:51:55,055 --> 00:51:56,796
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

791
00:51:56,796 --> 00:52:02,439
MATT: These flares bursting and slowly descending,
coming down and bringing this-- it was a purple

792
00:52:02,439 --> 00:52:03,992
flare and what was the color of yours?

793
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,682
TALIESIN: Gold, if I recall.

794
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:09,921
MATT: So gold and purple begin to burn down below,
giving this strange atmospheric light to the

795
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:15,614
outside of the large, still titan form as the
words across the sky, you begin to hear this low

796
00:52:15,614 --> 00:52:23,067
gathering of cheers. Thousands upon thousands upon
thousands of voices where you once heard screaming

797
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:28,549
and yelling now join in unison. A rallying cry of
victory that crawls across the entirety of

798
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:35,196
Vasselheim around you on all sides. What do you
guys want to do?

799
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:41,831
TRAVIS: I <i>need</i> that hand.

800
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:45,828
SAM: Do we have Locate Object or something?

801
00:52:45,828 --> 00:52:46,888
LIAM: I do.

802
00:52:46,888 --> 00:52:48,754
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

803
00:52:48,754 --> 00:52:51,193
SAM: Is it an object? I guess it's inanimate now.

804
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:53,022
MATT: It is considered an object now.

805
00:52:53,022 --> 00:52:54,123
LIAM: I do.

806
00:52:54,123 --> 00:52:54,941
LAURA: That's good.

807
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,115
LIAM: I got it. I've seen it. I have the spell
slot.

808
00:52:57,115 --> 00:53:02,326
MATT: All right. So you cast Locate Object and you
have a very strong vision of the direction and

809
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:06,491
it's maybe a hundred feet to your left, and it is
under quite a bit of rubble.

810
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,403
LIAM: Big man, come on. I'm going to need you to
dig; it's over here.

811
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:09,494
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

812
00:53:09,494 --> 00:53:10,512
MATT: All right.

813
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:11,622
SAM: Rage dig.

814
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:19,976
MATT: Giving him direction. Rage-digging through,
tossing veritable small boulders with one-handed

815
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:25,308
scoops. You guys are having to dodge out of the
way as they go flying by and skidding to a halt

816
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:33,758
maybe 50, 60 feet behind him. Go ahead and make an
investigation check with advantage, because of his aid.

817
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:39,983
TRAVIS: That's about as good as it gets, because
that's even worse. 16.

818
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,457
MATT: 16. Okay.

819
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:42,593
TRAVIS: With a minus two.

820
00:53:42,593 --> 00:53:45,714
MATT: It takes you a little while, but thanks to
Locate Object, you cruise through and you

821
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:54,655
eventually find-- It's been smashed, but it's still
intact and there you see the completely cut off,

822
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:58,964
red-scaled, clawed hand of Arkhan the Cruel.

823
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:01,783
TRAVIS: He fucked us.

824
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:03,812
MARISHA, SAM, and LIAM: Yeah.

825
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:07,432
LAURA: He helped us. And then he fucked us. Yeah.

826
00:54:07,432 --> 00:54:14,098
MARISHA: I guess the help was worth the fucking,
but only a little bit.

827
00:54:14,098 --> 00:54:15,149
TRAVIS: Yeah.

828
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:21,360
MATT: The voice creeps into your head. "Take it.
Find him. He has to die."

829
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,715
TRAVIS: Feel like I should take this and try and
find him. He's got to fucking die.

830
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:30,128
LAURA: Yeah, he probably does.

831
00:54:30,128 --> 00:54:37,717
TRAVIS: He was so cool and strong and only his
physique rivals my own, but I feel like he's got

832
00:54:37,717 --> 00:54:38,829
to die.

833
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:40,730
LIAM: Please. He couldn't touch you, are you
kidding?

834
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,157
MARISHA: You know, you're not having--

835
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:43,406
TRAVIS: Couldn't.

836
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:47,180
LAURA: You seem to like him a lot. Are you sure
you want to kill him and not just try to get--

837
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,425
MARISHA: Grog.

838
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:49,855
TRAVIS: What? Hold on.

839
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:56,700
MARISHA: We all think you're strong. You don't
need to have an inferiority complex.

840
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,067
TRAVIS: A what?

841
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,398
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think he's going to
understand.

842
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,163
LIAM: I don't think he has those.

843
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:06,532
TRAVIS: So he's a paladin of--

844
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:07,565
SAM: Tiamat.

845
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:09,394
TRAVIS: Right. Is that a good or a bad?

846
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:11,252
SAM: Bad, I'm guessing?

847
00:55:11,252 --> 00:55:16,984
MATT: Make a religion check with advantage because
you still have-- well, the blessing would have

848
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,194
worn off.

849
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:21,282
LIAM: That thing could rot. Do you know what
preserves a hand?

850
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:22,278
LAURA: The bag of colding.

851
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:23,530
SAM: More than 20.

852
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:28,093
MATT: Yeah, Tiamat's very bad. Known as the Scaled
Tyrant, she resides in the Nine Hells and is the

853
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:30,809
patron deity of all chromatic dragons.

854
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:35,971
SAM: Oh, yeah. She's the dragon god. She?

855
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:38,669
MATT: She. The opposite of Bahamut.

856
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,239
TRAVIS: Of good dragons, or bad?

857
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,332
SAM: Bad dragons.

858
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:49,466
TRAVIS: Okay. I feel like he had a good insight,
but the hand does bad things, right?

859
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:59,482
LAURA: The hand does really bad things. You know
what you should do is bring that to Bahamut.

860
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,047
LIAM: Yeah, after you piss on it.

861
00:56:01,047 --> 00:56:05,322
MARISHA: Why are you so connected to the pissing
thing?

862
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:07,536
LAURA: Don't piss on it, Grog.

863
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:08,961
TRAVIS: But he said preserve it.

864
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:12,401
LAURA: But then maybe if they try to use the hand
to find it, it might lead them to you instead

865
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,278
because you've already pissed on it.

866
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:15,723
TRAVIS: Lead them to my junk?

867
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:16,850
LAURA: Potentially.

868
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,250
TRAVIS: People have come looking for it for less.

869
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,718
LAURA: You don't want people chopping off your
junk thinking your junk is Vecna's hand, do you?

870
00:56:20,718 --> 00:56:26,571
TRAVIS: It doesn't even look like a hand. Just
like one really big middle finger.

871
00:56:26,571 --> 00:56:27,940
(laughter)

872
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,420
LIAM: It's like a mole, right?

873
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:38,119
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right, I have it. I'm not going
to preserve it.

874
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:40,623
LAURA: Put it in the bag of colding.

875
00:56:40,623 --> 00:56:42,531
LIAM: Such a mistake.

876
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:44,494
SAM: That's on the to-do list. We'll go find him.

877
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:46,169
LAURA: All right.

878
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,563
TRAVIS: And Bahamut is the platinum--

879
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:50,990
LAURA: Tiamat's the bad guy.

880
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,178
TRAVIS: No, Bahamut is the good dragon of the
platinum variety?

881
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,523
ALL: Yes.

882
00:56:56,523 --> 00:56:58,075
TRAVIS: Would you say they are at odds?

883
00:56:58,075 --> 00:56:59,153
TALIESIN and SAM: Yes.

884
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,025
LIAM: Safe bet.

885
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:01,381
TRAVIS: Like Godzilla and King Kong?

886
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:04,025
LIAM: I don't know those references, but yeah,
they are at odds.

887
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,857
MARISHA: What's-her-name worshipped Bahamut.

888
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,170
LAURA: Kima.

889
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,304
MARISHA: Was it Kima? Kima! Kima worships
Bahamut.

890
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,484
TRAVIS: She was badass.

891
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:14,525
LIAM and LAURA: Yes.

892
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:17,808
TRAVIS: I'll just hold on to the hand right now.

893
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:19,667
LAURA: What's going on there, Grog?

894
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:22,736
TRAVIS: Nothing. We just had a big fight.

895
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:28,003
TALIESIN: You're making that monologue face. Like
that face someone makes when they're listening to

896
00:57:28,003 --> 00:57:33,422
some very complex internal monologue. You don't
make that face very often. You're making it right

897
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:39,171
now. Just start speaking whatever's in your head
right now. Free-form.

898
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:42,838
TRAVIS: I have to go after the hand, I must kill
Vecna, I have to do these things.

899
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:49,487
TALIESIN: Okay, this is starting to paint a
picture. You feel better now?

900
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:50,538
TRAVIS: Nuh-huh.

901
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:51,549
TALIESIN: Okay.

902
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:54,039
MARISHA: Is that going on all the time in your
head?

903
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:54,965
TRAVIS: No.

904
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:55,802
MARISHA: Okay.

905
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:57,235
TALIESIN: Are you lying right now?

906
00:57:57,235 --> 00:57:58,615
SAM: He nodded when he said no.

907
00:57:58,615 --> 00:58:04,920
LIAM: DM, just for funsies, do I sense Vecna in
any way, shape, or form?

908
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,435
MATT: No.

909
00:58:06,435 --> 00:58:09,166
LIAM: Okay. Definitely want to piss on that hand,
Grog.

910
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:15,849
LAURA: Don't piss on the hand. Number one: it's
already in the bag of colding and I don't want

911
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:17,129
everything else pissed on.

912
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:18,637
LIAM: Grog and I don't share much!

913
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:20,010
TALIESIN: Except pissing?

914
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,786
(laughter)

915
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:26,681
TALIESIN: It was an honest question.

916
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:30,390
TRAVIS: That's true.

917
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,899
LAURA: What should we do, you guys?

918
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:33,634
TALIESIN: I'm so tired.

919
00:58:33,634 --> 00:58:36,769
MARISHA: I grab onto Vax and don't let go.

920
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:39,631
SAM: We have more pressing concerns.

921
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:41,713
TALIESIN: That does remind me. Scanlan?

922
00:58:41,713 --> 00:58:43,863
SAM: What?

923
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:46,040
TALIESIN: You're going to have to give it back
now.

924
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,020
SAM: Give what back?

925
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,510
TALIESIN: You know exactly what.

926
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,921
SAM: The gun?

927
00:58:52,921 --> 00:58:53,908
TALIESIN: Yes.

928
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,101
TRAVIS: That was part of a trade.

929
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:56,068
SAM: This is my gun.

930
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:57,161
TALIESIN: I don't think it's your gun.

931
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:58,207
SAM: I found it.

932
00:58:58,207 --> 00:58:58,984
TALIESIN: You didn't.

933
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:07,169
TRAVIS: No, there was a trade of items. I got a
cloak of smashing out of it, and you got... other stuff.

934
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,039
SAM: I found it fair and square; it's my gun.

935
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,904
TALIESIN: There's no fair and square. And
honestly, if you were anybody else, I would find

936
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:20,572
it when I was rummaging through your corpse later.
But it's you. So instead I just use my words, and

937
00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:27,438
I'm trying to be a better person. If you really
like it, maybe we'll have a special one made

938
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:31,358
that's a little safer. But not that one. That's
one of mine.

939
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:35,719
SAM: I look so cool.

940
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:42,682
TALIESIN: I'll make you something fancy that's a
little less prone to explode.

941
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:46,779
LIAM: Scanlan, you should know you always look
cool. Always.

942
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:48,818
TALIESIN: Especially with the head thing. It's
quite nice.

943
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,120
MARISHA: Yeah, this is awesome. Does he still have
the blessing?

944
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,485
MATT: The blessing has faded by now.

945
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:56,074
TALIESIN: You should get that tattooed in
permanently.

946
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:57,149
MARISHA: Yeah.

947
00:59:57,149 --> 00:59:58,467
SAM: That's a good idea.

948
00:59:58,467 --> 00:59:59,673
TALIESIN: That's a really good idea.

949
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:03,019
MARISHA: I can draw on you with the remaining
remnants. That way you have it there, always.

950
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,400
SAM: I love it.

951
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:10,779
MARISHA: Okay. I try to draw the outline of the
remaining glyph on his head.

952
01:00:10,779 --> 01:00:17,017
MATT: So you take some ash and charcoal from the
nearby rubble and loosely draw the symbol on his

953
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:19,647
forehead. Roll a dexterity check.

954
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:27,538
MARISHA: Okay. Straight dex? Don't fuck me, Gil!
14.

955
01:00:27,538 --> 01:00:29,374
MATT: 14. It's passable.

956
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:35,125
MARISHA: Yeah, that right there. That's perfect.
Get that tattooed.

957
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:40,540
SAM: All right. It's going to happen. I feel like
we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this.

958
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,176
TALIESIN: On the forehead?

959
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:43,786
LAURA and MARISHA: Definitely on the forehead.

960
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:47,444
LIAM: Well, maybe in different places. We don't all
need to get it in the same place. Maybe on a

961
01:00:47,503 --> 01:00:49,731
theme, but not the <i>exact</i> same thing?

962
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,752
LAURA: We already all got tattoos, didn't we?

963
01:00:51,752 --> 01:00:54,183
TALIESIN: Well, <i>we</i> got tattoos. That's all that
matters.

964
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,913
TRAVIS: No, we didn't.

965
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,836
MARISHA: I'm not sure what we're talking about
anymore.

966
01:00:57,836 --> 01:01:01,465
LAURA: No, I thought we got them in character.

967
01:01:01,465 --> 01:01:03,068
MARISHA: No, <i>he</i> got them.

968
01:01:03,068 --> 01:01:05,370
LIAM: I got one. And I got one.

969
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,448
LAURA: Oh, we got the Slayer's Take.

970
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:11,881
MARISHA: Wait, we're branded, and then I've got
mine, and then he has his.

971
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:18,696
LIAM: I have the burnt hand on my back. Elven. No,
it's <i>not</i> mostly healed. Scanlan Shorthalt! You

972
01:01:18,696 --> 01:01:23,418
don't need a gun to look cool. You are the Meat
Man. You are Burt Reynolds. You are a fucking hero.

973
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:27,585
SAM: I'm going to throw it away. Wrist Pocket!

974
01:01:27,585 --> 01:01:29,931
(laughter)

975
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:33,045
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

976
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:36,445
SAM: Nine. 12.

977
01:01:36,445 --> 01:01:38,017
MATT: 12?

978
01:01:38,017 --> 01:01:41,397
MARISHA: Bullshit! My passive perception is 21.

979
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,281
MATT: Yeah, you guys totally see him. It's the
worst example--

980
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:49,986
LIAM: That's the trick I do for my
eight-year-old!

981
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:54,374
TALIESIN: Look at it go! Wow!

982
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:59,298
(laughter)

983
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,984
TRAVIS: You caught it?! You threw it--

984
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:02,195
SAM: Around the world.

985
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:03,190
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

986
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,422
(laughter)

987
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:06,468
TRAVIS: I faint.

988
01:02:06,468 --> 01:02:08,107
(laughter)

989
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:11,517
LAURA: Hey, while he's out, should we get this
sword off him?

990
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:12,977
LIAM: Why?

991
01:02:12,977 --> 01:02:19,402
LAURA: Because it seems like he's a little weird
from it. Nobody else feels that way?

992
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,131
TALIESIN: I think so.

993
01:02:21,131 --> 01:02:32,806
TRAVIS: (gasps) You're so strong. What'd I miss?

994
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,346
LAURA: Nothing.

995
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:39,624
MARISHA: We were talking about you. I mean, we
were talking about-- sorry, I'm still working on it.

996
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:43,662
LAURA: Yeah, no, it's getting better. Should we
get off of the titan, maybe?

997
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:45,206
SAM: It could fall.

998
01:02:45,206 --> 01:02:48,338
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to start walking
towards the city to see how bad it really is?

999
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:52,241
LAURA: We'll have to get through the titan, or we
can fly down. Outside of that, I don't know.

1000
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:54,853
SAM: How many of us can fly? Well, I guess we
could take a couple of trips on the carpet.

1001
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:57,275
TALIESIN: We've got a carpet. Some of us have
wings.

1002
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,413
LIAM and MARISHA: My wings are gone.

1003
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:02,094
MATT: Yeah, your wings are gone. Pike's wings are
gone. You guys have your broom; you have the

1004
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:03,186
carpet.

1005
01:03:03,186 --> 01:03:05,607
SAM: So we can take three trips on the carpet, or
something?

1006
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:08,230
TALIESIN: We can ride on the broom.

1007
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,984
MARISHA: Have we taken a short rest, at this
point?

1008
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:13,197
MATT: Yeah, you guys would have taken a short
rest, at this point.

1009
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:15,014
MARISHA: My beast shape's back.

1010
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:19,140
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of when you were
helping with the ritual that he was casting,

1011
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,243
because that's an hour long, that would have been
a short rest, easy.

1012
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:23,576
LIAM: What are you going to be?

1013
01:03:23,576 --> 01:03:29,713
MARISHA: Well, what do you want to fly in on? What
do you want?

1014
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:32,369
LIAM: Dragon?

1015
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:37,142
MARISHA: I can't do that. I can do anything in the
animal kingdom.

1016
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:40,830
TRAVIS: Before we go down, before we leave, what
about Sylas?

1017
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,939
LAURA: (gasps) Sylas.

1018
01:03:43,939 --> 01:03:46,823
MARISHA: He flew away.

1019
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,593
LAURA: Right, but he's repairing somewhere.

1020
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:55,053
TRAVIS: They have coffins, right?

1021
01:03:55,053 --> 01:04:00,447
LIAM: We deduced that it doesn't take him that
long to come back together. And it's been--

1022
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:01,901
MATT: Not <i>terribly</i> long.

1023
01:04:01,901 --> 01:04:05,904
LIAM: But we're right at that cutoff point.

1024
01:04:05,904 --> 01:04:07,634
MATT: Maybe.

1025
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:12,344
TALIESIN: Try to scry on him! He's probably having
a bad day. There's enough time.

1026
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:14,031
MARISHA: I'll scry on him.

1027
01:04:14,031 --> 01:04:16,465
TALIESIN: There's a gold dragon that should be--

1028
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:18,920
MARISHA: Oh, I haven't used any of my 5th-level
spells!

1029
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,336
LAURA: Do you have Daylight, still? Something with
sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because

1030
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:24,657
it's during the day.

1031
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:35,434
MARISHA: Yeah. I still have 3rd-level spells. Yep.
I also have my 6th-level spells. I have Sunbeam

1032
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:36,820
learned, which is dope.

1033
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,290
LIAM: That's all you need.

1034
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,334
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to scry on him.

1035
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,387
TALIESIN: Grog, do you want to trade boots, by the
way, again?

1036
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:44,344
MATT: Okay, and he's used all of his resistances.

1037
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:46,108
TALIESIN: We don't have to, if you really like
them.

1038
01:04:46,108 --> 01:04:48,943
MARISHA: He's used all of his legendary
resistances? Is that what that was?

1039
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:56,094
MATT: Yeah. That is a natural 19 plus seven wisdom
save. So that's a 26.

1040
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:57,381
MARISHA: Oh my god!

1041
01:04:57,381 --> 01:04:59,258
SAM: He beat your scry?

1042
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:01,069
MARISHA: He rolled a natural 19?

1043
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:02,367
MATT: Natural 19.

1044
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:03,483
LAURA: You can't do it?

1045
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:04,912
MARISHA: I can do it again. Can I do it again?

1046
01:05:04,912 --> 01:05:06,093
MATT: If you have another spell slot for it.

1047
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:08,459
MARISHA: I do it again!

1048
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:12,176
MATT: Natural 16 plus seven. So that's a 23.

1049
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:14,514
SAM: That wins.

1050
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:20,583
LAURA: Can I try to cast Locate Object on the
pants he was wearing?

1051
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,637
LIAM: That's amazing!

1052
01:05:23,637 --> 01:05:27,227
LAURA: They're an object.

1053
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:29,091
TALIESIN: She <i>has</i> seen them.

1054
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,355
LAURA: I've seen them!

1055
01:05:30,355 --> 01:05:31,878
TALIESIN: They're very nice.

1056
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:34,932
MATT: Let me consult the verbiage of--

1057
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:40,182
LIAM: This is amazing, and I love you. That is
amazing!

1058
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:45,325
TALIESIN: That is the greatest thing I've ever
heard. Locate Pants. I would like to scry upon the

1059
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:46,892
pants. The pantalones.

1060
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:48,750
LIAM: On his loafers.

1061
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:56,681
MATT: Okay. All right, cool. And you have a
2nd-level spell slot for this?

1062
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,151
LAURA: Yes.

1063
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:06,536
MATT: So as you complete the spell and try to
focus as hard as you can on the pants of Lord

1064
01:06:06,536 --> 01:06:07,962
Sylas Briarwood--

1065
01:06:07,962 --> 01:06:09,751
TALIESIN: He has pajamas he changes into.

1066
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:11,428
LIAM: They're Batman pajamas.

1067
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:12,462
MATT: Nothing.

1068
01:06:12,462 --> 01:06:18,497
LAURA: Nothing? He's definitely recovering naked.
Fuck! Nothing.

1069
01:06:18,497 --> 01:06:19,498
MARISHA: No pants?

1070
01:06:19,498 --> 01:06:20,567
LAURA: No pants.

1071
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:23,284
LIAM: He's in the buck!

1072
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:25,520
MARISHA: You guys! He's shirt-cocking somewhere!

1073
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,514
(laughter)

1074
01:06:29,514 --> 01:06:34,558
MATT: He prepared! He knew! "It's the only way
they won't find me!" He pulls his tearaways off

1075
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,956
and chucks them.

1076
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:39,547
TRAVIS: Just goes up and says hi to people.

1077
01:06:39,547 --> 01:06:42,022
MARISHA: Flashing innocents through all the city!

1078
01:06:42,022 --> 01:06:44,214
MATT: It's his dominate action.

1079
01:06:44,214 --> 01:06:46,198
TRAVIS: Yeah, right!

1080
01:06:46,198 --> 01:06:48,672
LAURA: We're going to have to worry about him at
some point.

1081
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,064
SAM: Not now.

1082
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:55,713
MARISHA: I can try and scrying eye him. I also
still have one more 5th-level spell.

1083
01:06:55,713 --> 01:06:58,715
LAURA: Yeah, but how are we going to take him out
if you use all your spells to find him?

1084
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,398
MARISHA: I have a 6th.

1085
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:02,137
TRAVIS: Maybe we let him go.

1086
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:07,122
LIAM: She's saying you got one more shot, and we
still have some sunlight.

1087
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:08,834
LAURA and MARISHA: One more time.

1088
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:17,034
MATT: Well, you used the scrying eye before you
took the long rest in the Feywild, or was it

1089
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:17,950
after?

1090
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,725
LIAM: That was for finding the Sword of Kas,
wasn't it, before we slept?

1091
01:07:20,725 --> 01:07:23,149
MATT: Yeah, that would have been before. Yeah,
okay. So you can use it.

1092
01:07:23,149 --> 01:07:24,779
MARISHA: But I'm using my 5th-level spell first.

1093
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:25,768
MATT: Okay, you are?

1094
01:07:25,768 --> 01:07:26,948
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm using my 3rd.

1095
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:28,146
MATT: That's a natural seven.

1096
01:07:28,146 --> 01:07:29,358
SAM: That could work.

1097
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:40,728
MATT: As you close your eyes and focus, trying
desperately to find the location of Sylas

1098
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:46,655
Briarwood, your vision pulls back and is thrust
past the titan, and there's a flash of movement.

1099
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:59,252
You're suddenly seeing trees. You're sensing
somewhere in the thick forest of the Vasper

1100
01:07:59,252 --> 01:08:04,291
Timberlands. And there, you focus on rapidly
flapping bat wings.

1101
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,562
MARISHA: Still trying to get back? He's still
trying to get back!

1102
01:08:06,562 --> 01:08:11,218
MATT: You don't know. He's in the forest
somewhere. He's in a deep forest with bits of snow

1103
01:08:11,218 --> 01:08:15,373
around him. And you're only catching glimpses of
it as he goes through the shadowed underbrush.

1104
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:17,182
MARISHA: No type of landmark?

1105
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:20,139
MATT: Just trees, endless trees.

1106
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,305
LAURA: He's running away.

1107
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:24,708
TALIESIN: I would run if I were him.

1108
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,125
SAM: Deal with him another day.

1109
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,100
MARISHA: He's in the Vasper forest.

1110
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,076
LIAM: Well, we'll never see him again.

1111
01:08:30,076 --> 01:08:33,064
TALIESIN: He may finally have had enough.

1112
01:08:33,064 --> 01:08:37,004
MARISHA: Do you ever think there's a chance for
Lady Briarwood to come back?

1113
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,170
LAURA: I don't think so.

1114
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,944
TRAVIS and LIAM: Never say never.

1115
01:08:40,944 --> 01:08:42,523
TALIESIN: Never say never, but probably not.

1116
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:48,636
LAURA: I mean, if <i>we</i> can bring people back, they
might be able to.

1117
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:50,325
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

1118
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:54,483
TALIESIN: He would have to work <i>very</i> hard to
make it happen.

1119
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:57,691
TRAVIS: We're going to live a life of paranoia,
aren't we?

1120
01:08:57,691 --> 01:09:00,158
TALIESIN: Well, we knew that going in.

1121
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,529
SAM: We'll be okay.

1122
01:09:04,529 --> 01:09:08,483
LAURA: So do we go see the leaders here?

1123
01:09:08,483 --> 01:09:10,210
SAM: Yeah. Let's go.

1124
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,754
TALIESIN: Let's go see who's left.

1125
01:09:11,754 --> 01:09:13,700
MATT: All right.

1126
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,869
SAM: To the platinum temple?

1127
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:21,509
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
around the corner, you see there's a few of the

1128
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:26,173
eagle riders that are getting on their eagle back
and flying off. There is one figure that stays

1129
01:09:26,173 --> 01:09:31,896
behind and that turns around and begins to walk
your direction. In the chaos, you hadn't noticed

1130
01:09:31,896 --> 01:09:40,233
that when Vecna had been dispelled, the force cage
that had maintained and locked in J'mon Sa Ord had

1131
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:47,656
vanished. You see them turn around and look
towards you in humanoid form. They approach with

1132
01:09:47,656 --> 01:09:55,101
the long, jet-black hair, the darkened skin, the
beautiful coal-like ember eyes. Tall, almost as

1133
01:09:55,101 --> 01:10:05,371
tall as Grog, though lithe in form and simply
clothed. J'mon approaches. "Well, I'm certainly

1134
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:13,932
"impressed. I apologize to have not been as much
help as I had hoped."

1135
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:16,605
LAURA: That was a shitty spell he cast.

1136
01:10:16,605 --> 01:10:28,429
MATT: "It seems to be his forte. Nonetheless, the
least I can do is offer you a way into the city."

1137
01:10:28,429 --> 01:10:32,879
TRAVIS: That would be lovely.

1138
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:40,872
MATT: "I would like to speak with the council that
remains, as well. Come with me." J'mon turns

1139
01:10:40,872 --> 01:10:46,750
around and steps about 20 feet away before the
wings sprout out of their back and stretch to each

1140
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:53,948
side. You see the large brass dragon form expand,
the claws (impact) onto the ground. As they turn

1141
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:59,934
their head back over their shoulder, the deep
voice of the dragon form: "Hop on."

1142
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:08,727
LAURA: I'm going to hold on to Velora. And
Trinket, I swear it's going to be the last time,

1143
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:12,746
buddy. I'm not going to keep making you go in this
necklace much more.

1144
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:20,009
MATT: (bear grunts) Licks the side of your cheek.
And closes his eyes, waiting for it.

1145
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,237
LAURA: Ooh, I love him so much.

1146
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:24,157
MATT: Into the necklace.

1147
01:11:24,157 --> 01:11:30,116
LIAM: And as Vax and Keyleth get situated on
J'mon's back, I whisper in her ears: I was going

1148
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:32,962
to say eagle. Giant eagle.

1149
01:11:32,962 --> 01:11:36,436
MARISHA: Yeah. That's good to know.

1150
01:11:36,436 --> 01:11:41,640
TRAVIS: I pick up Pike and put her on my
shoulders. Get on the dragon.

1151
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:49,709
MATT: Okay. Pike climbs up, now wingless. "Thank
you." Grabs onto the belt you have across your chest.

1152
01:11:49,709 --> 01:11:50,935
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1153
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:55,317
MATT: All right. So do you all climb up onto
J'mon's back?

1154
01:11:55,317 --> 01:11:56,434
SAM: Absolutely.

1155
01:11:56,434 --> 01:12:04,321
MATT: All right. J'mon, in Devo'ssa form, then
begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of

1156
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:11,588
the city. Eventually, the wings begin to flap, and
with one giant thrust of wind, ascends. And once

1157
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:17,512
again, you feel the wind rocket through your hair,
as was your entry towards the titan. You begin to

1158
01:12:17,512 --> 01:12:25,242
crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the
titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim,

1159
01:12:25,242 --> 01:12:35,295
the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks
whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of

1160
01:12:35,295 --> 01:12:44,707
the city that you've essentially saved. And
really, did so through a quick jaunt to the

1161
01:12:44,707 --> 01:12:46,347
Feywild.

1162
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:58,767
The Braving Grounds still, while in severe
disarray and flames still burn, most everything's

1163
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:05,802
under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant
cultists, warriors, and undead have either been

1164
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:14,259
destroyed, captured, or run out of the city. As
you pick up 40, 50 feet over the rooftops, you see

1165
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:22,857
as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed
Bastions, as civilians of Vasselheim have picked

1166
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:28,715
up whatever arms were available, of soldiers in
the streets, children holding the hands of their

1167
01:13:28,715 --> 01:13:34,601
families, all glance up and point at the majestic
brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40,

1168
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:40,674
50 feet ahead, signifying once more a symbol of
hope and victory. You hear the shouts behind you.

1169
01:13:40,674 --> 01:13:46,658
As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's
Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps

1170
01:13:46,658 --> 01:13:49,044
leading up towards the platinum sanctuary.

1171
01:13:49,044 --> 01:13:59,900
As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps
are littered with broken bone, splatters of

1172
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:06,228
blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and
familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of

1173
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:13,090
slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict
is over here and has been for some time. The

1174
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:19,952
stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded
riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop

1175
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:26,208
the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform
itself before you approach the entryway in the

1176
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:36,284
pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa
lands right at the top of the stair as all the

1177
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:42,200
soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling
the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look

1178
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:48,043
at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower
themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off.

1179
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:55,893
As you do, you watch as the chatter, the
conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity

1180
01:14:55,893 --> 01:15:02,412
of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the
soldiers, even those who have seen better days,

1181
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:12,319
stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting
you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow

1182
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:21,640
of the head or kneel to you as you approach and
pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk

1183
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:27,837
towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors
open already, and glance over your shoulder to see

1184
01:15:27,837 --> 01:15:33,125
that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now
walking at your side.

1185
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:41,130
Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are
rushing around a bit, and they notice your

1186
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:44,911
arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure
that everything is accounted for, and there's a

1187
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:50,007
bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon,
who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches

1188
01:15:50,007 --> 01:16:02,115
quickly. "Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well.
You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine.

1189
01:16:02,115 --> 01:16:11,372
"I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best
that-- come with me." And darts back towards the

1190
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:15,679
central meeting chambers of the Platinum
Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that

1191
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,416
surround the wide marbled floors of the center
chamber where all these council meetings have

1192
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:24,108
previously taken place. You can see battle has
taken place here. While most of the bodies or the

1193
01:16:24,108 --> 01:16:29,707
wounded or dead have been removed at this point,
you can see there are elements of chipped and

1194
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:35,827
broken stone and marble. You can see scattered
remains and blood stains at points towards the

1195
01:16:35,827 --> 01:16:39,897
entryway. But most of it appears to have been
halted at the entryway. All of the combat has

1196
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:48,016
halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you
can see most of the council you met last is not

1197
01:16:48,016 --> 01:16:54,495
here. They're probably handling their various
portions of the city. But you do see amongst a

1198
01:16:54,495 --> 01:17:02,224
number of inner guardians of the sanctuary
Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen

1199
01:17:02,224 --> 01:17:11,903
a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side.
Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to

1200
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:16,734
approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As
Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens

1201
01:17:16,734 --> 01:17:26,003
and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of
formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she

1202
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:29,386
can give you a hug, she sees the child in your
arms.

1203
01:17:29,386 --> 01:17:32,474
LAURA: She's all right.

1204
01:17:32,474 --> 01:17:35,021
MATT: "I'm so glad."

1205
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:37,371
MARISHA: Yeah, group hug!

1206
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:44,686
MATT: She pulls you in, and you all bundle into
this big group hug, heaving breaths of relief

1207
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:52,238
cascade through your grouping. You hear the throat
clear behind as Vord goes, (clears throat).

1208
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:54,175
TRAVIS: Decorum.

1209
01:17:54,175 --> 01:17:57,922
LAURA: How's Kima?

1210
01:17:57,922 --> 01:18:05,553
MATT: "I assume she's well. She's been doing what
she does best, which is wander the streets,

1211
01:18:05,553 --> 01:18:13,448
"destroying things that she doesn't like. I've been
keeping a close eye from a distance as best I can.

1212
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:14,743
"She seems all right."

1213
01:18:14,743 --> 01:18:16,682
TALIESIN: Any word from Gilmore in the last hour?

1214
01:18:16,682 --> 01:18:19,097
MATT: "No, why?"

1215
01:18:19,097 --> 01:18:24,304
MARISHA: He was in the tower. He was a decoy; we
almost slayed him.

1216
01:18:24,304 --> 01:18:25,963
LAURA: He'd been taken.

1217
01:18:25,963 --> 01:18:28,244
LIAM and TALIESIN: He's all right.

1218
01:18:28,244 --> 01:18:32,119
SAM: Do we know where he teleported off to?

1219
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:34,835
MARISHA: We sent him off with Cassandra.

1220
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,514
TALIESIN: Into the woods.

1221
01:18:36,514 --> 01:18:39,631
LAURA: Into the wood.

1222
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:43,250
SAM: Don't worry, it's a big woods. It'll be
okay.

1223
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:47,525
LIAM: This city still stands. You have carried out
a miracle.

1224
01:18:47,525 --> 01:18:59,267
MATT: "I've done nothing. Word seems to--" And at
that point, she gets cut off by Highbearer Vord,

1225
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:08,487
who steps forward, his arms crossed. "Word seems
to have spread, and I wish not to celebrate

1226
01:19:08,487 --> 01:19:22,188
"prematurely. I have reports that you were there,
that you did battle with this ancient beast. What

1227
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:26,759
"is your assurance? What is your confidence that
this is indeed over, and we're not lulled into a

1228
01:19:26,759 --> 01:19:28,711
"false sense of security?"

1229
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:38,133
TRAVIS: We're pretty sure he's alive and well. You
know, he's a threat right now. (whispering) What,

1230
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:39,498
do we have proof?

1231
01:19:39,498 --> 01:19:40,879
LAURA: Oh, proof.

1232
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:43,437
TALIESIN: I've never known a true sense of
security. I'm not entirely sure.

1233
01:19:43,437 --> 01:19:46,329
SAM: The proof is we're here and we're alive.

1234
01:19:46,329 --> 01:19:48,404
LAURA: And that titan has stopped moving.

1235
01:19:48,404 --> 01:20:00,016
LIAM: I am the champion of the Raven Queen. And
she has allowed me to track his every movement for

1236
01:20:00,016 --> 01:20:01,206
a while now.

1237
01:20:01,206 --> 01:20:03,613
MATT: "I recall you mentioning that when we last
met."

1238
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:05,606
LIAM: He's gone.

1239
01:20:05,606 --> 01:20:08,210
TRAVIS: There was a process. We had trammels.

1240
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,982
LAURA: You remembered the word.

1241
01:20:10,982 --> 01:20:12,284
TRAVIS: Yes.

1242
01:20:12,284 --> 01:20:15,058
MARISHA: Do I still have the remains of the broken
trammel or did it shatter?

1243
01:20:15,058 --> 01:20:20,017
MATT: No, that shit shattered. It turned to dust.

1244
01:20:20,017 --> 01:20:24,205
LAURA: Yeah, glitter bomb. Oh, glitter-bomb Vecna!
I like the idea that he got glitter-bombed.

1245
01:20:24,205 --> 01:20:30,741
MATT: "That was my good eye!"

1246
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:33,349
(laughter)

1247
01:20:33,349 --> 01:20:38,877
MATT: All right. You see, as you guys are
discussing, the Highbearer's eyes lock to Vax's,

1248
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:46,024
and you see softness return to his face. The
tension, the unknowing, begins to subside with a

1249
01:20:46,024 --> 01:21:02,494
smile, comes across his stilted, older elvish
visage. "You all. There was a time I did not look past your

1250
01:21:02,494 --> 01:21:12,106
"beginnings. I am ashamed at my misjudgment." He
looks around as folks begin to gather. He

1251
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:23,065
acknowledges J'mon, who's approached. They've
bowed, carefully. "Many heroes rose to challenge

1252
01:21:23,065 --> 01:21:35,268
"this day. Many we've lost. And many others that
remain to remember them. Let us vow to never

1253
01:21:35,268 --> 01:21:47,679
"forget those who gave everything so that we could
still stand here to remember. You, Vox Machina,

1254
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:58,116
"stand as that beacon of hope upon which we all we
hold. You may not fully understand the scope of

1255
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:10,408
"what you have done but I assure you, we do. And we
will. We humble of Vasselheim are eternally in

1256
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:22,000
"your debt. As is much of the ignorant world,
perhaps. On behalf of Silver Talon's Reach, I

1257
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,489
"thank you for everything."

1258
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:33,927
The rest of the room who's begun to gather now,
you see other soldiers that were waiting outside

1259
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:40,656
as you first approached have begun to filter in. And
as you glance back towards the entry hallway of

1260
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:47,615
the Platinum Sanctuary, you see faces. People that
greeted you in. People hearing these words

1261
01:22:47,615 --> 01:22:51,526
resounding in silence, and they all begin to bow
low.

1262
01:22:51,526 --> 01:22:55,342
LAURA: This is weird.

1263
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:58,060
SAM: Should we say something?

1264
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,521
TRAVIS: Ask for money?

1265
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,946
LAURA: They haven't done our fees, right?

1266
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:04,960
MARISHA: I'm supremely uncomfortable.

1267
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,128
SAM: You are the leader of your people. Maybe you
should say something.

1268
01:23:08,128 --> 01:23:09,126
MARISHA: What?

1269
01:23:09,126 --> 01:23:10,377
SAM: You're a leader!

1270
01:23:10,377 --> 01:23:12,614
MARISHA: No! But I'm not a leader of these
people.

1271
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:16,613
LAURA: You've been giving us really good
inspirational speeches. Get up and say something.

1272
01:23:16,613 --> 01:23:19,912
TALIESIN: Get up and say something.

1273
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,787
LAURA: Say something really awesome.

1274
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:23,991
TALIESIN: Just tell people it was brilliant and
great.

1275
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:28,142
MARISHA: Okay. I step forward.

1276
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:38,261
MATT: So as you stand here amongst this procession
of warriors, people that now look up and don't see

1277
01:23:38,261 --> 01:23:42,316
Keyleth the druid, they see the Voice of the
Tempest. They see one of the

1278
01:23:42,316 --> 01:23:50,570
as-to-probably-be-remembered saviors of the city
and beyond. All eyes are on you as Highbearer Vord

1279
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,043
steps away.

1280
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:54,306
LIAM: I'm still holding your hand.

1281
01:23:54,306 --> 01:24:15,013
MARISHA: (chuckles, sighs) The bravery of
Vasselheim remains evident on this day, and you

1282
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:28,449
all should be proud that your reputation of a city
unfallen by invasion or attack remains, and that

1283
01:24:28,449 --> 01:24:40,775
is only because of the faith and the bravery and
the strength of the citizens of this amazing city.

1284
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:55,997
We of Vox Machina are proud and honored to have
fought by every single one of you, and we vow to

1285
01:24:55,997 --> 01:25:06,678
continue to stand by your side through the rest of
our days. Huzzah!

1286
01:25:06,678 --> 01:25:08,696
ALL: Huzzah!

1287
01:25:08,696 --> 01:25:18,856
(cheering)

1288
01:25:18,856 --> 01:25:20,665
ASHLEY: Hey, can you hear me?

1289
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:27,783
MATT: With a wave of cheers that roar from within
these marbled halls that echo, boom and

1290
01:25:27,783 --> 01:25:29,054
reverberate--

1291
01:25:29,054 --> 01:25:36,553
MARISHA: To 1,000 years of Vasselheim! Huzzah!

1292
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:42,464
MATT: Cheers and cries and fists raise and Pike's
cheering--

1293
01:25:42,464 --> 01:25:44,865
ASHLEY: Yay!

1294
01:25:44,865 --> 01:25:48,079
(laughter)

1295
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:57,431
MATT: You see Velora pull away from Allura's arm,
who's come by to help you carry her, and she:

1296
01:25:57,431 --> 01:26:10,550
(weakly) "Yay." And Allura looks to you with an
absolute look of respect and pride. Even the

1297
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:16,831
Highbearer seems to be taken by the words. Shit,
everyone in the room gets temporary hit points,

1298
01:26:16,831 --> 01:26:18,103
practically.

1299
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:23,810
MARISHA: Yeah! 20 hit points now.

1300
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:30,580
MATT: The sun-glass roof, which currently has been
sitting within the shadow of the mountain, the

1301
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:34,976
sunlight begins to peak past and glide
its way across the marble floor as everyone's

1302
01:26:34,976 --> 01:26:40,770
cheering and the room now, which once was in
shadow of the mountain, is now lit up with

1303
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:46,978
sunlight. Now you can see the glittering armor
that peeks through the dirt, the grime, the blood,

1304
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:53,138
shining and sparkling on each of you, across
Pike's beautiful armor, across all the warriors

1305
01:26:53,138 --> 01:26:59,540
that stand here, across the Scalebearer's design,
across your hair. The room is filled with light

1306
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:07,344
and though you sense the presence of probably
Bahamut, glancing down you can't help but think

1307
01:27:07,344 --> 01:27:17,122
that this is also the approving glance of Pelor,
perhaps a bit of the Everlight. As the cheers

1308
01:27:17,122 --> 01:27:24,704
begin to fade, the crowd begins to pull away.
Conversations progress, thank-yous are given,

1309
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:30,062
people come up to you. And eventually you guys
begin to step out of the Sanctuary and there you

1310
01:27:30,062 --> 01:27:34,202
look down across the upper platform, looking down
over the city. You can see the Birthheart, the

1311
01:27:34,202 --> 01:27:43,000
Duskmeadow, pillars of smoke rising up as the sun
now hangs high in the sky.

1312
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:52,492
A cold sensation takes you in the chest, Vax. A
small pain.

1313
01:27:52,492 --> 01:28:06,776
A second one. And your eyes shoot over across to
the Raven's Crest, damaged but still standing. You

1314
01:28:06,776 --> 01:28:13,699
turn around to look at the rest of your family and
as you guys look at his face, in but a flash you

1315
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:24,702
can see this dark shape behind him. This looming
black cloak, this lithe dress that cascades down

1316
01:28:24,702 --> 01:28:32,224
into a bell and drags across the ground. And there
you see the form of the Raven Queen, porcelain

1317
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:41,130
mask, long dark hair behind, as her hands slowly
creep over the shoulders of Vax'ildan.

1318
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:46,224
TALIESIN: I walk to step in between.

1319
01:28:46,224 --> 01:28:47,791
MATT: In between the two of them?

1320
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:49,096
TALIESIN: Yes.

1321
01:28:49,096 --> 01:28:56,836
MATT: While the lips do not move on this mask, the
voice in your head says, "You've done well, but do

1322
01:28:56,836 --> 01:28:59,552
"not approach. This is not for you."

1323
01:28:59,552 --> 01:29:01,518
MARISHA: No.

1324
01:29:01,518 --> 01:29:04,574
TALIESIN: Do you recall what you told me once?

1325
01:29:04,574 --> 01:29:08,197
MATT: No response. Do you continue to walk?

1326
01:29:08,197 --> 01:29:09,627
TALIESIN: I do.

1327
01:29:09,627 --> 01:29:11,878
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1328
01:29:11,878 --> 01:29:13,737
LIAM: Percy.

1329
01:29:13,737 --> 01:29:23,454
TALIESIN: No. No, that's-- actually, you know
what? Hey, that's right. I'm going to Resolve that.

1330
01:29:23,454 --> 01:29:25,229
LIAM: Freddie.

1331
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:30,524
TALIESIN: This is not about you. That's a 19, 22.

1332
01:29:30,524 --> 01:29:32,139
MATT: That does not do it.

1333
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:33,493
TALIESIN: Damn it. I have a 19.

1334
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:42,325
MATT: I know. Muscles lock into place and you find
yourself held there on your third step. The voice,

1335
01:29:42,325 --> 01:29:52,924
which is omnipresent in your mind, all about,
continues. Soothing. Cold, distant but still

1336
01:29:52,924 --> 01:30:04,284
soothing. The mask slowly looks down towards you.
"You have done well, my champion. The skein of

1337
01:30:04,284 --> 01:30:12,273
"destiny has tugged in your wake, and even this
victory culminates with the crossing of a few

1338
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:24,167
"fate-touched souls. By your hand, your bravery,
your sacrifice, you ensure a future for all you

1339
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:34,976
"love and all who will come to love you and what
you've done. You may never know the import of your

1340
01:30:34,976 --> 01:30:43,223
"time here, but take solace in the knowledge that
you will see the ripples of your actions carry

1341
01:30:43,223 --> 01:30:58,575
"hope for generations to come. My Vax'ildan. It is
time. Say your goodbyes, then come join my side."

1342
01:30:58,575 --> 01:31:04,612
And the hands pull away. She stands there.

1343
01:31:04,612 --> 01:31:14,991
SAM: Now? We don't even get a night together or
anything?

1344
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:19,138
MARISHA: It's not fair.

1345
01:31:19,138 --> 01:31:28,915
LAURA: We've got a really long time to be alive.
You've got an infinite time. What's a few more years?

1346
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:38,793
MARISHA: He sacrificed himself in your name; you
remain the only ascended. And yet he still loses?

1347
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:51,714
MATT: "He does not lose. The gifts I gave, indeed
all of your patrons gave, were so that you," and

1348
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:59,063
you watch as her hands extend almost impossibly
long around her, "and everyone here still stands.

1349
01:31:59,063 --> 01:32:12,756
"I understand selfishness. I understand the impulse
of mortality. But I would hope that you understand

1350
01:32:12,756 --> 01:32:26,595
"that the actions that you've allowed Vax'ildan in
this sacrifice are far larger. But we made a deal.

1351
01:32:26,595 --> 01:32:29,868
"With power comes a price."

1352
01:32:29,868 --> 01:32:41,143
MARISHA: I'm not ready.

1353
01:32:41,143 --> 01:32:47,576
LIAM: You're ready for your people.

1354
01:32:47,576 --> 01:32:50,978
MARISHA: Not without you.

1355
01:32:50,978 --> 01:33:13,492
LIAM: I am so very proud of you, and so grateful
for everything you gave to me. You are going to be

1356
01:33:13,492 --> 01:33:16,276
a strong leader and a wise leader.

1357
01:33:16,276 --> 01:33:27,725
MARISHA: I'll find you. I promise. I'll see you
again.

1358
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:31,976
LIAM: I'll never be that far away.

1359
01:33:31,976 --> 01:33:38,539
MARISHA: Forever.

1360
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:50,264
LIAM: And ever and always.

1361
01:33:50,264 --> 01:34:09,328
Boys. My brothers... I love you.

1362
01:34:09,328 --> 01:34:25,103
SAM: We love you, too. Thank you for everything.
If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and

1363
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:27,169
we will.

1364
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:32,584
LIAM: Maybe from the other side. Someday, just for
shits and giggles.

1365
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:41,688
TRAVIS: Can I ask, are you afraid?

1366
01:34:41,688 --> 01:35:00,452
LIAM: I'm going to go visit my mother, and I'll
see all of you again. Freddie.

1367
01:35:00,452 --> 01:35:04,506
TALIESIN: I do not accept this.

1368
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:18,974
LIAM: I know. But I charge you to take good care
of my sister and love her. And your friend

1369
01:35:18,974 --> 01:35:28,540
Keyleth, love her, as well. She will need it. She
will need friends.

1370
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,076
TALIESIN: Of course.

1371
01:35:31,076 --> 01:35:39,475
LIAM: Thank you for trying.

1372
01:35:39,475 --> 01:35:43,290
SAM: I wish I could have done more.

1373
01:35:43,290 --> 01:36:05,632
LIAM: You did everything. Pickle? Pickle, you
showed me the way. I know it doesn't look like

1374
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:09,441
that right now, but you absolutely did.

1375
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:15,183
ASHLEY: I wish I could restore you.

1376
01:36:15,183 --> 01:36:29,359
LIAM: (chuckles) You taught me purpose, Pickle.
Purpose. And I know I will see you again.

1377
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:37,806
ASHLEY: Isn't there--

1378
01:36:37,806 --> 01:36:43,233
SAM: She said is there something we can do? It's
hard to hear her.

1379
01:36:43,233 --> 01:37:01,890
LIAM: Be there for them. You be there for them.
You're the light in all our lives.

1380
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:04,249
LAURA: No.

1381
01:37:04,249 --> 01:37:13,785
LIAM: I never had a greater friend than you. And
we traveled a lot, I never had a greater friend

1382
01:37:13,785 --> 01:37:19,289
than you.

1383
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:26,505
LAURA: I feel like she's taking part of me away.

1384
01:37:26,505 --> 01:37:34,826
LIAM: I will bring it with me to remind me of
you.

1385
01:37:34,826 --> 01:37:38,975
LAURA: I don't know how to live.

1386
01:37:38,975 --> 01:37:47,849
LIAM: I will see you again.

1387
01:37:47,849 --> 01:37:49,202
LAURA: I know.

1388
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:59,545
LIAM: I will see you again. And I will tell your
mother that you say hello.

1389
01:37:59,545 --> 01:38:10,277
LAURA: Please. 
I love you. I don't accept this.

1390
01:38:10,277 --> 01:38:35,388
LIAM: I know that it's hard. And I am sorry.

1391
01:38:35,388 --> 01:38:52,345
LAURA: I'm going to find you.

1392
01:38:52,345 --> 01:39:01,790
LIAM: I take Keyleth's face in my hands and
happily take one more kiss. I'm sorry it's so cold.

1393
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:17,921
MARISHA: I don't care. I don't accept this. I love
you.

1394
01:39:17,921 --> 01:39:31,146
LIAM: I will never stop loving you.

1395
01:39:31,146 --> 01:39:33,663
MARISHA: This isn't fair.

1396
01:39:33,663 --> 01:39:36,078
LIAM: I know.

1397
01:39:36,078 --> 01:39:44,911
MARISHA: I guess we have to say goodbye.

1398
01:39:44,911 --> 01:40:01,120
LIAM: For now. I love you, Keyleth of the Air
Ashari.

1399
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:12,018
MARISHA: I love you, Vax'ildan. I'll see you
again.

1400
01:40:12,018 --> 01:40:33,974
LIAM: I look to the Raven Queen and as I walk
closer, since I leveled up, I use the druid

1401
01:40:33,974 --> 01:40:48,302
cantrip Druidcraft and grow snowdrops out from
where I stand, out to all of my family. Out to

1402
01:40:48,302 --> 01:41:02,062
where they stand. S.H.I.T.s, thank you.

1403
01:41:02,062 --> 01:41:35,300
How lucky I have been to have had all of you. 
How lucky, indeed. Thank you.

1404
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:47,827
MATT: And he turns and walks towards the darkened
cloak of his matron. In the darkness of her cloak,

1405
01:41:47,827 --> 01:42:02,189
you see a brief light, and it's brighter for you.
As you walk forward, you see reaching from the

1406
01:42:02,189 --> 01:42:13,132
light the dark hair, the fair skin, and the wide
smile of your mother, Elaina. As she greets you,

1407
01:42:13,132 --> 01:42:18,701
she says, "I'm so proud."

1408
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:23,638
The rest of you watch as her cloak begins to fade
like a slowly scattered shadow in creeping

1409
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:31,828
sunlight. And as the snowdrop flowers continue
with each step, you blink,

1410
01:42:31,828 --> 01:42:45,952
and it's just feathers.

1411
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:54,357
We're going to take a break, we'll be back here in
a few minutes, guys. (heavy exhale) Still more of

1412
01:42:54,357 --> 01:43:03,050
this story to tell. See you guys in a bit.

1413
01:43:03,050 --> 02:10:08,068
[break]

1414
02:10:08,068 --> 02:10:12,299
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So before
we jump back in, our winner in the chat of the

1415
02:10:12,299 --> 02:10:18,661
giveaway is Mister Milgram. Congratulations.
Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact

1416
02:10:18,661 --> 02:10:26,046
information and get your prize sent off to you, so
well done. All right, so. Bringing us back in.

1417
02:10:26,046 --> 02:10:28,799
TALIESIN: No.

1418
02:10:28,799 --> 02:10:32,133
SAM: Something feels different about the table.

1419
02:10:32,133 --> 02:10:39,908
MATT: Yeah. As the cold wind subsides and the
feathers glide through the wind off the edge of

1420
02:10:39,908 --> 02:10:53,796
the Silver Talon's Reach, pinnacle of Platinum
Sanctuary, you gather your thoughts. Quiet creeps

1421
02:10:53,796 --> 02:10:59,528
over.

1422
02:10:59,528 --> 02:11:06,919
SAM: I feel like I could have taken her if I had a
gun. I'm just saying.

1423
02:11:06,919 --> 02:11:10,221
MARISHA: Scanlan, have we ever told you you're an
asshole?

1424
02:11:10,221 --> 02:11:12,050
SAM: All the time.

1425
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:14,629
TALIESIN: I use Manners on Scanlan.

1426
02:11:14,629 --> 02:11:19,310
MATT: All right. What's the save on that?

1427
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:25,922
TALIESIN: Wow. Where is it?

1428
02:11:25,922 --> 02:11:28,223
MARISHA: You got to sort through all your coffee
stains.

1429
02:11:28,223 --> 02:11:30,546
TALIESIN: These are my coffee stains.

1430
02:11:30,546 --> 02:11:32,366
MARISHA: He's really irritable.

1431
02:11:32,366 --> 02:11:35,680
SAM: Jesus, you have so many things.

1432
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:38,640
TALIESIN: Yes, I do. It's a--

1433
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:44,398
LAURA: I hug Trinket.

1434
02:11:44,398 --> 02:11:46,703
TALIESIN: Ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency

1435
02:11:46,703 --> 02:11:48,029
bonus.

1436
02:11:48,029 --> 02:11:52,322
MARISHA: Keyleth sits next to Vex and lays her
head on her shoulder.

1437
02:11:52,322 --> 02:11:53,015
SAM: Against AC?

1438
02:11:53,015 --> 02:11:54,103
TALIESIN: Against you.

1439
02:11:54,103 --> 02:11:56,162
SAM: Oh. (laughs) I'm out.

1440
02:11:56,162 --> 02:12:03,998
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's a six, 12, 24, I think.

1441
02:12:03,998 --> 02:12:06,700
MATT: Okay and what's the-- or it just hits and he
has to make--

1442
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:09,841
TALIESIN: It just hits. You can make a strength
check against 20.

1443
02:12:09,841 --> 02:12:15,300
MATT: To try and break out of it as an action,
right? So as you finish your statement, Percival

1444
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:25,123
throws an orb at you and it expands, locks you up
into this cage of metal bars and claws and chains,

1445
02:12:25,123 --> 02:12:27,227
and you're locked in place, unable to move.

1446
02:12:27,227 --> 02:12:28,478
SAM: Feels right.

1447
02:12:28,478 --> 02:12:30,376
TRAVIS: Was that necessary?

1448
02:12:30,376 --> 02:12:32,527
TALIESIN: I'll let him out when I'm feeling like
it.

1449
02:12:32,527 --> 02:12:34,375
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

1450
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:39,172
MARISHA: I don't have the strength to argue with
him.

1451
02:12:39,172 --> 02:12:42,407
LAURA: Sorry, Scanlan.

1452
02:12:42,407 --> 02:12:45,605
SAM: (muffled) It's okay. I'm okay in here.

1453
02:12:45,605 --> 02:12:48,036
TALIESIN: Actually, I'll unlock it so he can say
that.

1454
02:12:48,036 --> 02:12:55,779
SAM: Oh, hi. That was a very touching ceremony.
Well, I'll just be in here, crying.

1455
02:12:55,779 --> 02:12:57,885
MARISHA: Aw.

1456
02:12:57,885 --> 02:13:04,879
LAURA: Percy, please let him out, I can't take it
right now.

1457
02:13:04,879 --> 02:13:09,061
TALIESIN: I very quickly go through Scanlan's
pockets to make sure there's nothing else that I

1458
02:13:09,061 --> 02:13:10,834
need to take back from him.

1459
02:13:10,834 --> 02:13:12,213
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1460
02:13:12,213 --> 02:13:18,720
TALIESIN: Thank you. Nope. I let him out.
Manners.

1461
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:23,745
MARISHA: That might be the last natural one of
this campaign. You have to scream it from a

1462
02:13:23,745 --> 02:13:25,443
mountaintop, man.

1463
02:13:25,443 --> 02:13:27,797
SAM: The golden snitch!

1464
02:13:27,797 --> 02:13:29,977
LAURA: How could you do that?

1465
02:13:29,977 --> 02:13:31,382
MARISHA: Betrayal.

1466
02:13:31,382 --> 02:13:33,593
MATT: It's mine now.

1467
02:13:33,593 --> 02:13:36,378
(laughter)

1468
02:13:36,378 --> 02:13:38,380
TRAVIS: A celestial hand reaches out of the
clouds.

1469
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:40,185
MATT: Hello, next campaign.

1470
02:13:40,185 --> 02:13:41,526
LAURA: Oh shit.

1471
02:13:41,526 --> 02:13:43,010
MARISHA: One man's trash.

1472
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:46,696
LAURA: Keyleth, dear.

1473
02:13:46,696 --> 02:13:48,575
MARISHA: Yes?

1474
02:13:48,575 --> 02:13:58,651
LAURA: I know it was never made official, but I'm
assuming you two would've spent your life

1475
02:13:58,651 --> 02:14:04,108
together. As much of it as he had, anyway.

1476
02:14:04,108 --> 02:14:13,441
MARISHA: He taught me how to love and I have a
hard time with interpersonal relationships.

1477
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:15,854
LAURA: I would've never known.

1478
02:14:15,854 --> 02:14:22,795
MARISHA: So I would've held onto that one for as
long as I could've. And I still will.

1479
02:14:22,795 --> 02:14:28,352
LAURA: I still count you as my sister.

1480
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:36,201
MARISHA: As I count you as mine. Going to have to
look out for each other now.

1481
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:40,635
LAURA: Yes.

1482
02:14:40,635 --> 02:14:43,429
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly wander outside.

1483
02:14:43,429 --> 02:14:47,511
MATT: You're on the platform outside.

1484
02:14:47,511 --> 02:14:50,385
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to break off for a
second.

1485
02:14:50,385 --> 02:14:52,041
MARISHA: Also, fuck that raven bitch.

1486
02:14:52,041 --> 02:14:53,088
LAURA: She's terrible.

1487
02:14:53,088 --> 02:14:54,188
MARISHA: What the fuck?

1488
02:14:54,188 --> 02:14:58,934
LAURA: You know we have a temple to her in
Whitestone. I mean, here's the thing though. I

1489
02:14:58,934 --> 02:15:03,472
feel like I want to destroy it because I hate her
so much, but at the same time, I feel like we

1490
02:15:03,472 --> 02:15:07,731
should leave it because maybe we can talk to him
through it. We'll try it.

1491
02:15:07,731 --> 02:15:12,512
TRAVIS: Pike.

1492
02:15:12,512 --> 02:15:14,966
ASHLEY: Yeah?

1493
02:15:14,966 --> 02:15:32,532
TRAVIS: While we're here, I feel like if Bahamut
is the natural enemy of Tiamat, I don't know if I

1494
02:15:32,532 --> 02:15:55,427
want to be bound to this sword for much longer. I
feel like my time of hunting Vecna is done. I feel like

1495
02:15:55,427 --> 02:16:11,636
we have Arkhan's hand. Maybe if we handed it over
to the Platinum-- these people?

1496
02:16:11,636 --> 02:16:14,906
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah.

1497
02:16:14,906 --> 02:16:18,092
TRAVIS: Then somebody else could take up that
hunt, right?

1498
02:16:18,092 --> 02:16:28,061
ASHLEY: If that's what you want, Grog. I don't
think that's a bad idea.

1499
02:16:28,061 --> 02:16:43,435
TRAVIS: Yeah. Okay. I think I want to turn over
this sword, but would you stay with me?

1500
02:16:43,435 --> 02:16:45,770
ASHLEY: Of course I will.

1501
02:16:45,770 --> 02:17:04,940
TRAVIS: He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, 
will you come with me also?

1502
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:07,189
SAM: Absolutely.

1503
02:17:07,189 --> 02:17:13,399
TRAVIS: All right. Can I make my way back towards
somebody official-looking?

1504
02:17:13,399 --> 02:17:22,985
MATT: That would be either Highbearer Vord or
the one you met earlier.

1505
02:17:22,985 --> 02:17:25,620
TRAVIS: Highbearer Orb sounds good.

1506
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:33,237
MATT: As you step back into the Platinum
Sanctuary, the voice creeps in your head. "I know

1507
02:17:33,237 --> 02:17:40,560
"not what you're thinking, but know: together we are
more powerful than anyone who's wielded me. We

1508
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:46,450
"could take him down. We could destroy it all. You
cannot, you will not discard me."

1509
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:50,436
TRAVIS: Anyone ever? Stronger than anyone that's ever
wielded you?

1510
02:17:50,436 --> 02:17:56,835
MATT: "Anyone who's ever wielded me. Together, we
could bring down anything that bears his title.

1511
02:17:56,835 --> 02:17:59,964
"Anyone who pursues his power."

1512
02:17:59,964 --> 02:18:02,610
ASHLEY: Grog?

1513
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:04,054
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1514
02:18:04,054 --> 02:18:05,820
ASHLEY: What's he saying?

1515
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:13,690
TRAVIS: (sighs) You make a really good point.
We're really strong together and unstoppable.

1516
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:19,001
MATT: You feel this (pulse) in your brain, there's
a flash vision of the hand, once held in your

1517
02:18:19,001 --> 02:18:24,118
grasp, swollen atop the actual body of
Vecna in the battle. Your vision comes back and

1518
02:18:24,156 --> 02:18:26,844
that urge in your belly creeps up.

1519
02:18:26,844 --> 02:18:33,070
TRAVIS: I mean, hold on, Pike. Maybe we could do a
lot of good. We could really rid the world of a

1520
02:18:33,070 --> 02:18:35,705
lot of bad stuff.

1521
02:18:35,705 --> 02:18:47,093
ASHLEY: Listen, we did that before you knew this
sword. We're all strong together. You were strong

1522
02:18:47,093 --> 02:18:49,332
before it and you'll be strong after it.

1523
02:18:49,332 --> 02:18:59,891
TRAVIS: (exhales) Okay. (strained) Highbearer Orb,
a moment, please.

1524
02:18:59,891 --> 02:19:08,223
MATT: As you enter the chamber once more, the
Highbearer turns around. "Yes, Grog Strongjaw,

1525
02:19:08,223 --> 02:19:10,016
"what do you require?"

1526
02:19:10,016 --> 02:19:15,111
TRAVIS: I would like to make a deposit.

1527
02:19:15,111 --> 02:19:18,922
MATT: "Go on."

1528
02:19:18,922 --> 02:19:28,019
TRAVIS: I have on my person the Sword--

1529
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:30,267
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1530
02:19:30,267 --> 02:19:35,319
TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

1531
02:19:35,319 --> 02:19:41,156
MATT: The words don't escape your mouth and you
realize this was a bad idea.

1532
02:19:41,156 --> 02:19:59,994
TRAVIS: (sighs) I'm so sorry to waste your time. I
wanted to thank you for hosting us. Bidet. And I

1533
02:19:59,994 --> 02:20:02,220
start to turn and walk out.

1534
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:05,901
ASHLEY: I grab him by the hand. So he can't go
anywhere.

1535
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:07,988
SAM: Are you not doing this, Grog?

1536
02:20:07,988 --> 02:20:11,334
TRAVIS: It's a bad idea.

1537
02:20:11,334 --> 02:20:18,847
MATT: "We could do so much together. We can destroy
anyone who's ever thought to pray to the now

1538
02:20:18,847 --> 02:20:22,994
"Undying King sealed away. We could wipe his
presence from this planet!"

1539
02:20:22,994 --> 02:20:27,044
TRAVIS: (strained) Together we could do so much,
we could dry eraser-board the planet.

1540
02:20:27,044 --> 02:20:33,206
SAM: Whatever your wishes are, Grog. I'll go along
with it. If you wish to keep the sword, that's

1541
02:20:33,268 --> 02:20:34,484
fine with me.

1542
02:20:34,484 --> 02:20:35,970
TRAVIS: I want to keep it.

1543
02:20:35,970 --> 02:20:36,971
SAM: Great.

1544
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:39,110
ASHLEY: Scanlan, I don't think this is a good
idea.

1545
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:42,788
SAM: Okay. Sell me on this.

1546
02:20:42,788 --> 02:20:47,860
ASHLEY: Look at him!

1547
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:53,496
SAM: He's just flexing his face muscles.

1548
02:20:53,496 --> 02:20:55,601
ASHLEY: He's getting all weird.

1549
02:20:55,601 --> 02:20:57,351
TRAVIS: (strained) I want to keep it!

1550
02:20:57,351 --> 02:21:00,852
SAM: No, he does this when he needs to go poo.
I've seen him do it.

1551
02:21:00,852 --> 02:21:05,257
ASHLEY: I know. He definitely does this when he
needs to go poo. But this is so much worse!

1552
02:21:05,257 --> 02:21:11,320
SAM: I mean, it's been a hard day. I think we all
need a really good bowel movement.

1553
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:13,763
TRAVIS: I start walking out of the Sanctuary.

1554
02:21:13,763 --> 02:21:15,049
MATT: Pike, make a strength check.

1555
02:21:15,049 --> 02:21:16,559
ASHLEY: No. Yes.

1556
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:22,494
MATT: So roll and add your strength modifier,
which I think is four.

1557
02:21:22,494 --> 02:21:23,937
ASHLEY: It's five.

1558
02:21:23,937 --> 02:21:25,584
MATT: Oh, it's five.

1559
02:21:25,584 --> 02:21:27,043
LAURA: She's got the gauntlets on.

1560
02:21:27,043 --> 02:21:30,684
MATT: Gauntlets bring it to 19, so it'll be a plus
four, I'm pretty sure.

1561
02:21:30,684 --> 02:21:32,933
ASHLEY: Wait, I think I had a plus one somewhere.

1562
02:21:32,933 --> 02:21:35,266
SAM: Did you get some boon or boost or something?

1563
02:21:35,266 --> 02:21:39,039
ASHLEY: With a plus four, it's 17.

1564
02:21:39,039 --> 02:21:41,108
MATT: 17. Grog, roll a strength check.

1565
02:21:41,108 --> 02:21:43,361
LAURA: Roll a one! Roll a one!

1566
02:21:43,361 --> 02:21:45,250
TRAVIS: 19.

1567
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:50,858
MATT: 19. Pike, your feet begin to scrape against
the marble as Grog's form and strength, which is

1568
02:21:50,858 --> 02:21:54,467
just a little bit more than you. He's a little
more monster than your monster right now.

1569
02:21:54,467 --> 02:21:57,292
ASHLEY: Can I swing my other hand up and try to
pull more?

1570
02:21:57,292 --> 02:21:59,998
MATT: I'll allow you one more strength check with
disadvantage.

1571
02:21:59,998 --> 02:22:02,118
SAM: Really conflicted here.

1572
02:22:02,118 --> 02:22:09,432
TRAVIS: (strained) I want to help the planet.

1573
02:22:09,432 --> 02:22:11,802
SAM: He seems totally normal to me.

1574
02:22:11,802 --> 02:22:13,171
ASHLEY: 14.

1575
02:22:13,171 --> 02:22:15,067
MATT: Grog, roll another strength check.

1576
02:22:15,067 --> 02:22:19,724
TRAVIS: 15.

1577
02:22:19,724 --> 02:22:26,044
MATT: Still, your metal boots are scraping across
the marble as you're pulling and trying to hold

1578
02:22:26,044 --> 02:22:31,766
him back as he's walking out the room. The voice
says, "Yes. Together, the two of us."

1579
02:22:31,766 --> 02:22:42,298
TRAVIS: (strained) Just the two of us. We can make
it if we try! Just the two of us, Kas and I.

1580
02:22:42,298 --> 02:22:46,444
MATT: Highbearer Vord says, "Is everything all
right?"

1581
02:22:46,444 --> 02:22:50,013
SAM: Pike, do you want me to try to stop him?
What's going on?

1582
02:22:50,013 --> 02:22:57,703
ASHLEY: I think this is not a good idea. Grog,
this is something you wanted to do. You need to

1583
02:22:57,703 --> 02:22:59,294
fight it.

1584
02:22:59,294 --> 02:23:01,908
TRAVIS: Can I try and fight it?

1585
02:23:01,908 --> 02:23:08,423
MATT: You already lost at the moment. So yeah,
he's currently locked into that mindset.

1586
02:23:08,423 --> 02:23:12,385
SAM: Pike, should I do something or no?

1587
02:23:12,385 --> 02:23:18,253
ASHLEY: Well, I think we could both do something,
but I want Grog to fight this.

1588
02:23:18,253 --> 02:23:31,254
SAM: Why don't I help him fight it? I will cast
Suggestion on Grog, using my last level two spell.

1589
02:23:31,254 --> 02:23:47,274
And suggest that he think long and hard about
maybe fighting back against this sword. One more time.

1590
02:23:47,274 --> 02:23:49,640
ASHLEY: Then if it doesn't work, I have an idea.

1591
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:55,735
MATT: All right. So bringing up Suggestion here,
make a wisdom saving throw, Grog.

1592
02:23:55,735 --> 02:24:01,716
TRAVIS: 11.

1593
02:24:01,716 --> 02:24:10,084
MATT: 11. Okay. As the suggestion creeps through
your mind, the familiar voice of Scanlan through

1594
02:24:10,084 --> 02:24:17,197
your ears gives you just enough moment of pause to
allow you an additional saving throw against the

1595
02:24:17,197 --> 02:24:19,497
influence.

1596
02:24:19,497 --> 02:24:26,186
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll take mine-- is it a wisdom
saving throw?

1597
02:24:26,186 --> 02:24:27,458
MATT: Yes, it is.

1598
02:24:27,458 --> 02:24:29,426
TRAVIS: That's a five.

1599
02:24:29,426 --> 02:24:31,154
TALIESIN: My god, we're saved.

1600
02:24:31,154 --> 02:24:35,093
MATT: The suggestion does not seem to take hold
and he's now dragged Pike almost back to the

1601
02:24:35,093 --> 02:24:39,984
entryway of the Platinum Sanctuary and the
Highbearer is still looking a bit confused.

1602
02:24:39,984 --> 02:24:42,995
SAM: He's made his choice.

1603
02:24:42,995 --> 02:24:51,458
ASHLEY: No! Grog. Stop just one moment.

1604
02:24:51,458 --> 02:24:53,700
TRAVIS: Okay. I stop.

1605
02:24:53,700 --> 02:25:05,765
ASHLEY: And I look him in the eyes, I cast Greater
Restoration. Still have another slot left, will

1606
02:25:05,765 --> 02:25:07,317
that work?

1607
02:25:07,317 --> 02:25:12,782
MATT: I would like you to go ahead and make a
wisdom check. This is contested against the wisdom

1608
02:25:12,782 --> 02:25:14,254
of the sword.

1609
02:25:14,254 --> 02:25:18,900
ASHLEY: I'm casting it at 7th-level because that's
all I have left.

1610
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:24,057
MATT: You know what, it's not going to have much
of an effect on this really, unfortunately. But

1611
02:25:24,057 --> 02:25:26,926
the spell's cast. So roll a d20 and add your
wisdom modifier.

1612
02:25:26,926 --> 02:25:33,864
MARISHA: You're smarter than a sword!

1613
02:25:33,864 --> 02:25:39,189
ASHLEY: Do I get an advantage?

1614
02:25:39,189 --> 02:25:46,086
MATT: Unfortunately, no in the circumstance. Just
roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier, which I

1615
02:25:46,086 --> 02:25:47,428
believe is a five?

1616
02:25:47,428 --> 02:25:53,790
ASHLEY: I have. Yeah, it's five. So nine.

1617
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:57,052
MARISHA and SAM: Oh!

1618
02:25:57,052 --> 02:26:03,725
MATT: Well, (laughs).

1619
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:05,180
ASHLEY: You die.

1620
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:08,530
MATT: Yeah, you actually die. No.
That's not worth it. It's fine.

1621
02:26:08,530 --> 02:26:10,120
SAM: Vax comes back and kills you.

1622
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:17,835
MATT: Yeah. I rolled a seven and he has a wisdom
modifier of plus one.

1623
02:26:17,835 --> 02:26:19,594
LAURA: Oh shit!

1624
02:26:19,594 --> 02:26:22,357
MARISHA: Oh my god, you did it!

1625
02:26:22,357 --> 02:26:28,331
MATT: Like I legitimately-- that's pretty stupid.

1626
02:26:28,331 --> 02:26:30,371
TALIESIN: Did you use my die?

1627
02:26:30,371 --> 02:26:40,471
MATT: No, I did not use your die. I used my purple
one. I'm saving yours for the next campaign. So as

1628
02:26:40,471 --> 02:26:47,167
the strength of wills between the cleric and the
sword begin to combat, the warmth of Pike's

1629
02:26:47,167 --> 02:26:52,941
friendship and the force of Sarenrae's guidance
washes through your body and the cold steel of the

1630
02:26:52,941 --> 02:26:58,320
sword begins to warm to the touch. And for a brief
minute, it gets so warm it's hot. It burns your

1631
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:03,296
fingertips and you instinctively throw the blade
to the ground. It clatters and slides about 15

1632
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:08,821
feet from you, spiralling and sparking across the
marble floor. The Highbearer's foot catches it in

1633
02:27:08,821 --> 02:27:14,955
place. He leans forward. "Now I'm certainly
curious."

1634
02:27:14,955 --> 02:27:22,198
TRAVIS: (deep breath) It is the Sword of Kas.

1635
02:27:22,198 --> 02:27:26,561
MATT: You watch as the color begins to somewhat
return to Grog's face, his eyes returning to their

1636
02:27:26,561 --> 02:27:33,689
natural pigment. The sallow, sunken features of
his body begin to fill out once more, the

1637
02:27:33,689 --> 02:27:37,127
influence of the blade having left his psyche and
physicality.

1638
02:27:37,127 --> 02:27:42,680
ASHLEY: Oh. You're back to light gray again. You
look great.

1639
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:49,603
TRAVIS: I'm feeling so achy. What happened?
Whew!

1640
02:27:49,603 --> 02:27:55,544
ASHLEY: You made a decision and I felt it was the
right thing to do.

1641
02:27:55,544 --> 02:27:57,644
TRAVIS: Yeah. We kept the sword, right?

1642
02:27:57,644 --> 02:27:59,636
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's there.

1643
02:27:59,636 --> 02:28:02,915
SAM: They're holding it for you.

1644
02:28:02,915 --> 02:28:07,883
TRAVIS: Oh. Okay.

1645
02:28:07,883 --> 02:28:13,471
MATT: At this point, you can see two of the other
Scalebearer guardians have flanked the sides of

1646
02:28:13,471 --> 02:28:18,441
the Highbearer. As he removes his foot from the
blade and steps back, they both carefully lift it

1647
02:28:18,441 --> 02:28:26,162
with a gauntlet and present it before him and he
glances down. "So you say this blade aided you?"

1648
02:28:26,162 --> 02:28:35,959
TRAVIS: Yes. That blade, careful with it, very
powerful. He is bent on the destruction of one thing

1649
02:28:35,959 --> 02:28:42,085
and one thing only. Vecna.

1650
02:28:42,085 --> 02:28:51,252
MATT: "Good to know. We'll keep this within our
vaults in case the day or time arises."

1651
02:28:51,252 --> 02:28:55,199
TRAVIS: Wait! I have something else. Then I show
the hand of Arkhan.

1652
02:28:55,199 --> 02:29:02,240
MATT: "Yes?" It flops limply in your grasp.

1653
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:11,885
TRAVIS: Oh! The person that owned this hand--
okay, stay with me. Chopped this off and took

1654
02:29:11,885 --> 02:29:18,151
Vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got
left over. So this is not his hand anymore and the

1655
02:29:18,151 --> 02:29:28,456
one that he does have is Vecna's. So if you use
your noodle, you can use this to trace him.

1656
02:29:28,456 --> 02:29:37,549
MATT: "There are limitations to the use of such
objects. It may be of some aid to us, but the

1657
02:29:37,549 --> 02:29:43,664
"knowledge of this individual is far more
important. However, we will accept this thing."

1658
02:29:43,664 --> 02:29:47,892
And he ushers his hand forward and another servant
comes forward and retrieves the hand from you and

1659
02:29:47,892 --> 02:29:53,388
folds the fingers up and places it within a small
pillow. Backs away.

1660
02:29:53,388 --> 02:29:55,598
ASHLEY: I think that was a great idea.

1661
02:29:55,598 --> 02:29:57,037
TRAVIS: Yeah, right? It was pretty smart.

1662
02:29:57,037 --> 02:29:58,526
ASHLEY: Yes, it was very smart.

1663
02:29:58,526 --> 02:30:03,828
MATT: "What was the name of this? This current
wielder of the Hand of Vecna."

1664
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:06,889
TRAVIS: Arkin. Arkeen?

1665
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:08,139
SAM: Arkhan.

1666
02:30:08,139 --> 02:30:14,975
TRAVIS: Arkhan. Arkhan the Fool. The Cruel. The--

1667
02:30:14,975 --> 02:30:16,782
SAM: Misguided.

1668
02:30:16,782 --> 02:30:19,776
MATT: "Arkhan the Misguided?"

1669
02:30:19,776 --> 02:30:26,300
TRAVIS: Don't underestimate him. He's really buff
and devious.

1670
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:32,276
SAM: And he's got another hand that he could chop
off too. One in reserve.

1671
02:30:32,276 --> 02:30:42,661
MATT: "Very well. So we'll begin to do research
and seek out this Arkhan the Cruel?"

1672
02:30:42,661 --> 02:30:47,353
TRAVIS: Cool. Yeah, he was pretty cool. He was
pretty cool.

1673
02:30:47,353 --> 02:30:50,823
SAM: I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch
his name.

1674
02:30:50,823 --> 02:30:57,255
TRAVIS: Well see, don't hurt him. He actually
helped us defeat Vecna. He pulled a tricksy-doodle

1675
02:30:57,255 --> 02:30:58,992
and took the hand.

1676
02:30:58,992 --> 02:31:06,599
MATT: "I would do whatever it takes to not trust
individuals who would steal such an artifact with

1677
02:31:06,599 --> 02:31:08,036
"their own means."

1678
02:31:08,036 --> 02:31:10,585
TRAVIS: Sure.

1679
02:31:10,585 --> 02:31:16,571
MATT: "We'll find this individual. Rest assured.
The will of Bahamut turned on him now, I doubt

1680
02:31:16,571 --> 02:31:20,856
"he'll find a place to hide. Thank you very much."

1681
02:31:20,856 --> 02:31:26,666
TRAVIS: Yep. Beep beep. All right, Pike, shall we away?

1682
02:31:26,666 --> 02:31:30,381
ASHLEY: We shall away.

1683
02:31:30,381 --> 02:31:33,176
TRAVIS: Scanlan, shall we away?

1684
02:31:33,176 --> 02:31:35,046
SAM: Away we shall.

1685
02:31:35,046 --> 02:31:36,679
TRAVIS: Away we-- oui oui?

1686
02:31:36,679 --> 02:31:38,750
ASHLEY and SAM: Oui oui!

1687
02:31:38,750 --> 02:31:41,251
SAM, TRAVIS, and ASHLEY: Bidet.

1688
02:31:41,251 --> 02:31:47,530
MATT: "Bidet." As you exit the Sanctuary, you meet
up with the rest of your friends that are still

1689
02:31:47,530 --> 02:31:53,186
taking their quiet moments of reflection on the
exterior platform on the outside of the Sanctuary

1690
02:31:53,186 --> 02:31:56,708
overlooking the eastern side of Vasselheim.

1691
02:31:56,708 --> 02:31:59,394
ASHLEY: How do you feel?

1692
02:31:59,394 --> 02:32:07,876
TRAVIS: I feel good. I feel like pursuing Vecna
was something that we all did together and I feel

1693
02:32:07,876 --> 02:32:16,050
like whatever we do now is new and I felt like I
was going to have to do that on my own and I don't

1694
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:18,209
want to do that.

1695
02:32:18,209 --> 02:32:20,375
LAURA: Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on
your own.

1696
02:32:20,375 --> 02:32:23,965
TRAVIS: That's good to know.

1697
02:32:23,965 --> 02:32:26,632
LAURA: Yeah. We're in this together.

1698
02:32:26,632 --> 02:32:31,210
SAM: I've got a thing, actually, I've got to get to.

1699
02:32:31,210 --> 02:32:38,452
LAURA: Can I walk over to Percy? Are you still over
by yourself?

1700
02:32:38,452 --> 02:32:43,548
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. I'll take care of something.
I'm sitting in a corner and I'm staring into the

1701
02:32:43,548 --> 02:32:54,390
reflection of my sword. And I'm gently tapping the
contract in my pocket. And I'm going to say,

1702
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:57,039
Ipkesh.

1703
02:32:57,039 --> 02:32:59,523
LAURA: No. I'm going to sit down next to you.

1704
02:32:59,523 --> 02:33:12,301
TALIESIN: You're too late. You've been doing a
thing. Could you bring him back? Would it, the

1705
02:33:12,301 --> 02:33:16,666
thing that you gave me, bring him back?

1706
02:33:16,666 --> 02:33:18,872
MATT: There's no answer.

1707
02:33:18,872 --> 02:33:31,895
TALIESIN: Hmm. Nothing at all. All right.

1708
02:33:31,895 --> 02:33:37,819
LAURA: Now I'm going to sit down next to you. How
are you?

1709
02:33:37,819 --> 02:33:59,967
TALIESIN: I have no idea. I think I really miss my
family. I think I miss my sisters and my parents.

1710
02:33:59,967 --> 02:34:16,444
I think I was going to be a clockmaker once. I
haven't thought about that. There was a moment. Do

1711
02:34:16,444 --> 02:34:18,009
you remember when we met?

1712
02:34:18,009 --> 02:34:19,622
LAURA: I do.

1713
02:34:19,622 --> 02:34:31,732
TALIESIN: I, for a brief time, thought that I had
died within that prison and I was having a fever

1714
02:34:31,732 --> 02:34:41,801
dream from starvation and this was what that felt
like, was my mind making stories of friends and

1715
02:34:41,801 --> 02:34:49,486
adventures and these things I would never do
because I was a coward and fool. I miss my family

1716
02:34:49,486 --> 02:35:04,350
so much and I've done some terrible things. I gave
Grog that sword.

1717
02:35:04,350 --> 02:35:06,161
LAURA: You did.

1718
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:10,740
TALIESIN: It didn't feel real.

1719
02:35:10,740 --> 02:35:13,872
LAURA: Now it does.

1720
02:35:13,872 --> 02:35:22,356
TALIESIN: I don't know. This is new. I'm sorry.

1721
02:35:22,356 --> 02:35:33,701
LAURA: What were you going to do? Are you going to
fight the Raven Queen for me?

1722
02:35:33,701 --> 02:35:47,358
TALIESIN: Many years ago, I went to make a deal
with her and she told me that I was broken and

1723
02:35:47,358 --> 02:35:55,623
that I had always been broken. Part of me was
going to save your brother and really, I just

1724
02:35:55,623 --> 02:36:01,866
wanted to prove it to her. I wanted to hurt her
for hurting me.

1725
02:36:01,866 --> 02:36:05,724
LAURA: I think we're all broken, Percy.

1726
02:36:05,724 --> 02:36:08,334
TALIESIN: I am so tired of hurting people.

1727
02:36:08,334 --> 02:36:14,905
LAURA: You don't have to hurt anyone anymore.

1728
02:36:14,905 --> 02:36:16,930
TALIESIN: I love you very much.

1729
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:18,293
LAURA: I love you.

1730
02:36:18,293 --> 02:36:20,131
TALIESIN: This has been a terrible day.

1731
02:36:20,131 --> 02:36:22,352
LAURA: It's horrible!

1732
02:36:22,352 --> 02:36:29,504
TALIESIN: Where's Kiki? Where's Scanlan? I think I
owe him an apology. Oh god, I owe Grog an apology.

1733
02:36:29,504 --> 02:36:33,538
Maybe I'll not apologize to Grog. That sounds like
a really terrible idea.

1734
02:36:33,538 --> 02:36:35,916
LAURA: Darling.

1735
02:36:35,916 --> 02:36:37,126
TALIESIN: Yes?

1736
02:36:37,126 --> 02:36:46,208
LAURA: You're a good person and you're not broken
anymore. All right? We'll filling each other's

1737
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:49,363
gaps. We'll be the glue.

1738
02:36:49,363 --> 02:36:51,682
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1739
02:36:51,682 --> 02:37:06,797
LAURA: And don't do anything crazy anymore. No
deals with Raven Queens, all right? Let's not

1740
02:37:06,797 --> 02:37:08,908
fight any more gods.

1741
02:37:08,908 --> 02:37:13,245
TALIESIN: I was going to say let's destroy
the one in Whitestone. Maybe we could seal it up,

1742
02:37:13,334 --> 02:37:15,228
leave it because you know, but--

1743
02:37:15,228 --> 02:37:20,264
LAURA: I want to see if I can talk to him
through it. Is that stupid?

1744
02:37:20,264 --> 02:37:31,163
TALIESIN: How would I know? Seems worth a shot.
I'm too tired to be angry.

1745
02:37:31,163 --> 02:37:40,262
LAURA: We did a thing today. A pretty big thing.

1746
02:37:40,262 --> 02:37:44,332
TALIESIN: Was that today? It legitimately feels
like a week ago at this point.

1747
02:37:44,332 --> 02:37:50,413
(laughter)

1748
02:37:50,413 --> 02:38:03,562
TALIESIN: It's been a long day. Yeah, we'll
rejoin. Sorry about Manners. That was rude.

1749
02:38:03,562 --> 02:38:06,204
SAM: Are you apologizing for something?

1750
02:38:06,204 --> 02:38:07,390
TALIESIN: Yes.

1751
02:38:07,390 --> 02:38:08,993
SAM: That's stupid.

1752
02:38:08,993 --> 02:38:10,274
TALIESIN: I know.

1753
02:38:10,274 --> 02:38:12,251
SAM: I never said sorry for leaving!

1754
02:38:12,251 --> 02:38:17,404
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you're you. You don't have to
apologize, we just assume.

1755
02:38:17,404 --> 02:38:23,918
SAM: Well, I'm sorry. Sorry I left.

1756
02:38:23,918 --> 02:38:27,852
TALIESIN: I will not accept it so that when you
come to your senses later, you don't feel like

1757
02:38:27,852 --> 02:38:30,332
you've compromised. But thank you.

1758
02:38:30,332 --> 02:38:34,959
(laughter)

1759
02:38:34,959 --> 02:38:36,945
SAM: That's fair.

1760
02:38:36,945 --> 02:38:41,242
TRAVIS: You handing out apologies?

1761
02:38:41,242 --> 02:38:48,109
TALIESIN: No. Yes. Sorry about the skull.

1762
02:38:48,109 --> 02:38:52,535
MARISHA: Oh. I'm pretty sure you just handed out
an apology after you just said you weren't going

1763
02:38:52,535 --> 02:38:54,102
to hand out an apology.

1764
02:38:54,102 --> 02:38:58,264
TALIESIN: I'm a human. I'm made of contradictions.
You people wouldn't understand.

1765
02:38:58,264 --> 02:39:01,035
MARISHA: I think Percy is a walking
contradiction.

1766
02:39:01,035 --> 02:39:06,130
TRAVIS: I will consider accepting your apology if
you tell me whatever happened to it.

1767
02:39:06,130 --> 02:39:11,809
TALIESIN: (sighs) Oh my god. I legitimately don't
remember.

1768
02:39:11,809 --> 02:39:14,047
MARISHA: I thought-- wait, we--

1769
02:39:14,047 --> 02:39:21,525
MATT: At that point, two hands drape around the
side of Grog's shoulder up top and Vex as the long

1770
02:39:21,525 --> 02:39:28,827
golden braids down the arms of Allura Vysoren
says, "My friend Grog, best not to worry about it.

1771
02:39:28,827 --> 02:39:32,420
"Wherever it is, it's beyond our grasp now."

1772
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:34,932
TRAVIS: Okay, Allura.

1773
02:39:34,932 --> 02:39:43,017
(laughter)

1774
02:39:43,017 --> 02:39:48,281
MARISHA: Did you just sitcom mug? "Okay, Allura!"

1775
02:39:48,281 --> 02:39:54,387
(laughter)

1776
02:39:54,387 --> 02:39:56,696
MATT: If we could've freeze-framed and rolled credits
on that to end the campaign, I would have been

1777
02:39:56,696 --> 02:40:07,277
happy. (laughs) Allura takes her hands back, then
reaches over and musses up the side of Pike's

1778
02:40:07,277 --> 02:40:13,326
hair. (sighs) "We've been through quite a bit
together, haven't we?"

1779
02:40:13,326 --> 02:40:17,865
LAURA: So much.

1780
02:40:17,865 --> 02:40:20,734
MATT: "Lot of ups and downs."

1781
02:40:20,734 --> 02:40:25,820
MARISHA: You were quite an inspiration, Allura. I
hope you know. You inspired me quite a lot.

1782
02:40:25,820 --> 02:40:33,507
MATT: "I'm only doing what everybody else is doing
in this world: make it up as you go along."

1783
02:40:33,507 --> 02:40:42,663
MARISHA: We know a lot about that. Allura, is
Vasselheim going to be looking for members to join

1784
02:40:42,663 --> 02:40:44,630
the council?

1785
02:40:44,630 --> 02:40:52,553
MATT: "Vasselheim? What do you mean? Vasselheim is
mostly a religious council, if you know."

1786
02:40:52,553 --> 02:40:55,905
MARISHA: Totally.

1787
02:40:55,905 --> 02:41:02,379
MATT: "I could put in a word, but I didn't 
consider this really your type of--"

1788
02:41:02,379 --> 02:41:03,345
MARISHA: No, right.

1789
02:41:03,345 --> 02:41:04,405
MATT: "Here?"

1790
02:41:04,405 --> 02:41:06,994
SAM: She's asking for somebody else, I'm pretty
sure she wasn't asking for her.

1791
02:41:06,994 --> 02:41:08,616
MARISHA: I actually was, actually.

1792
02:41:08,616 --> 02:41:11,487
MATT: "Oh. I can inquire."

1793
02:41:11,487 --> 02:41:16,062
MARISHA: I was thinking Pike, but I don't know--

1794
02:41:16,062 --> 02:41:22,630
MATT: "If I do recall, you have a temple here. One
that you pretty much built."

1795
02:41:22,630 --> 02:41:24,736
TALIESIN: How is that temple right now?

1796
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:37,502
MATT: "That's a very good question. Pike? Would
you like to go see your temple?"

1797
02:41:37,502 --> 02:41:41,604
ASHLEY: I would like to go see my temple.

1798
02:41:41,604 --> 02:41:46,828
MATT: "Very well." She waves her fingers a bit and
casts Fly on all of you.

1799
02:41:46,828 --> 02:41:49,207
LAURA: Oh shit, on everybody?!

1800
02:41:49,207 --> 02:41:51,172
MATT: On a high enough level, you can.

1801
02:41:51,172 --> 02:41:55,255
ASHLEY: Whoa.

1802
02:41:55,255 --> 02:42:04,840
TRAVIS: Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl)

1803
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:07,707
LAURA: That was the best wookiee noise you've ever
made, babe!

1804
02:42:07,707 --> 02:42:09,443
TALIESIN: That was a really good wookiee noise.

1805
02:42:09,443 --> 02:42:11,120
TRAVIS: (mediocre wookiee growl)

1806
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:20,092
MATT: Retracted immediately. As she was here
helping defend, she didn't waste her 8th-level

1807
02:42:20,092 --> 02:42:25,743
slot, she is able to get you guys all flying for
the moment and you all coast. As she finishes

1808
02:42:25,743 --> 02:42:29,993
casting the spell, you could see some of the
nearby wardens of the Platinum Sanctuary go,

1809
02:42:29,993 --> 02:42:38,547
"Um--" "I know it's arcane, shut up. It's fine."
You all take off the steps and begin to glide down

1810
02:42:38,547 --> 02:42:47,856
over to the city, and there you can already see
people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So

1811
02:42:47,856 --> 02:42:52,542
eventually, you find your way north to the
Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair

1812
02:42:52,542 --> 02:42:58,954
Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple
looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It

1813
02:42:58,954 --> 02:43:06,585
looks like a portion of the upper floor of the
three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does

1814
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:13,400
taper a bit towards the top. The top part has
partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear

1815
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:21,336
and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been
destroyed or anything. As you come up to the

1816
02:43:21,336 --> 02:43:27,179
temple, you can already see there are refugees of
homes that were destroyed from the incursion of

1817
02:43:27,179 --> 02:43:32,053
the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and
the temple's filled with people. On the outside,

1818
02:43:32,053 --> 02:43:41,146
you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you
found the temple and build it. As she

1819
02:43:41,146 --> 02:43:44,828
approaches, she's now one of the Priests of
Rebirth and has been working with you for some

1820
02:43:44,828 --> 02:43:50,007
time and turns and sees your face. You can see her
graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in

1821
02:43:50,007 --> 02:43:57,942
the back. She has her spectacles and she has the
long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. "My

1822
02:43:57,942 --> 02:44:03,484
"Pike!" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's
much bigger than you, being a human, but her

1823
02:44:03,484 --> 02:44:08,082
posture puts her almost on your level. "I'm so
glad you're safe."

1824
02:44:08,082 --> 02:44:10,566
ASHLEY: It's so wonderful to see your face.

1825
02:44:10,566 --> 02:44:16,155
MATT: "We've housed who we can. We're a bit at
capacity at the moment."

1826
02:44:16,155 --> 02:44:21,387
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, it looks a bit better than I
thought it would.

1827
02:44:21,387 --> 02:44:26,552
MATT: "We did our best to defend. Is it done?"

1828
02:44:26,552 --> 02:44:30,380
ASHLEY: It's done.

1829
02:44:30,380 --> 02:44:39,858
MATT: You see her eyes crack at that moment and
tears begin to flow. She smiles. "I knew you could

1830
02:44:39,858 --> 02:44:41,383
"do it."

1831
02:44:41,383 --> 02:44:43,958
ASHLEY: Well, we all did.

1832
02:44:43,958 --> 02:44:50,931
MATT: She looks around at the rest of you, pats
you on the head for a minute and pulls away and

1833
02:44:50,931 --> 02:44:56,502
goes, "You get to wear the greatest outfits, don't
you?"

1834
02:44:56,502 --> 02:44:59,276
ASHLEY: (giggles)

1835
02:44:59,276 --> 02:45:09,523
MATT: "Well, anything you need, food, we have room
for a few more."

1836
02:45:09,523 --> 02:45:19,088
SAM: I would suggest that we-- there's bars here,
right? In Vasselheim? They drink, don't they?

1837
02:45:19,088 --> 02:45:22,771
MATT: Oh, yeah. There's bars here.

1838
02:45:22,771 --> 02:45:24,897
MARISHA: Maybe they do a dry city after a certain
time.

1839
02:45:24,897 --> 02:45:31,058
MATT: Are you kidding me? Religion and alcohol go
together perfectly. That's a time-honored

1840
02:45:31,058 --> 02:45:32,534
tradition!

1841
02:45:32,534 --> 02:45:41,131
SAM: Why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and
let these people pick up the pieces, and give them

1842
02:45:41,131 --> 02:45:43,051
their space?

1843
02:45:43,051 --> 02:45:47,178
MARISHA: Do you need any type of water, or
anything we can immediately assist you with?

1844
02:45:47,178 --> 02:45:49,538
MATT: "Clean water would be wonderful."

1845
02:45:49,538 --> 02:45:51,451
MARISHA: Do you have somewhere to put it?

1846
02:45:51,451 --> 02:45:57,606
MATT: "Just a moment!" And she goes inside for a
moment and calls out, four of the other lower

1847
02:45:57,606 --> 02:46:02,923
acolytes of Sarenrae's temple, and they all have
various buckets and reservoirs--

1848
02:46:02,923 --> 02:46:07,891
MARISHA: I burn as many Create Water spells as it
takes to fill them up.

1849
02:46:07,891 --> 02:46:12,767
MATT: They bring you inside, where there's the
large statue of Sarenrae, where you had your first

1850
02:46:12,767 --> 02:46:17,947
vision that called you to come find her. And there
is a fountain as part of that and a reservoir in

1851
02:46:17,947 --> 02:46:22,784
the bottom that has currently been mostly emptied
to facilitate everyone here who needed water or to

1852
02:46:22,784 --> 02:46:29,897
clean wounds. You help fill that and you very,
very quickly manage to get the temple back to an

1853
02:46:29,897 --> 02:46:32,046
easily sustainable level.

1854
02:46:32,046 --> 02:46:33,658
TALIESIN: Pike?

1855
02:46:33,658 --> 02:46:35,415
ASHLEY: Yes?

1856
02:46:35,415 --> 02:46:47,458
TALIESIN: I could use your assistance. I don't
think I should have this, and I need this to be

1857
02:46:47,458 --> 02:46:54,281
taken away from me before I do something foolish.
And I hand Pike my contract.

1858
02:46:54,281 --> 02:47:04,082
ASHLEY: (sighs) I take it. Percy, what is this?

1859
02:47:04,082 --> 02:47:15,558
TALIESIN: This, I thought, was proof that I was in
control of myself. But it's just a terrible thing

1860
02:47:15,613 --> 02:47:17,921
waiting to happen.

1861
02:47:17,921 --> 02:47:20,184
SAM: Ashley, I just texted you the contract.

1862
02:47:20,184 --> 02:47:24,360
TALIESIN: Thank you. How do you have it on
autosave?! Do you just have it?

1863
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:25,834
SAM: Yeah.

1864
02:47:25,834 --> 02:47:30,810
ASHLEY: I mean, I somewhat know what it is.

1865
02:47:30,810 --> 02:47:35,519
TALIESIN: I don't think it can be destroyed. But
maybe it can be put far away.

1866
02:47:35,519 --> 02:47:42,697
ASHLEY: I will keep this, at the very least, very
far from you.

1867
02:47:42,697 --> 02:47:48,840
TALIESIN: I have every faith in you. Thank you. I
think I'm done with that.

1868
02:47:48,840 --> 02:48:00,844
SAM: Pike, I have a porno book that I really think
I shouldn't have anymore. Can I give it to you to

1869
02:48:00,844 --> 02:48:01,941
take it away--

1870
02:48:01,941 --> 02:48:03,107
TALIESIN: I'll take it away!

1871
02:48:03,107 --> 02:48:04,311
SAM: Oh, you'll take it? Okay.

1872
02:48:04,311 --> 02:48:07,074
TRAVIS: I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah,
I have some money still--

1873
02:48:07,074 --> 02:48:09,724
SAM: It's not great.

1874
02:48:09,724 --> 02:48:11,279
TALIESIN: Can you text it to us actually?

1875
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:14,095
ASHLEY: Could you text me the book?

1876
02:48:14,095 --> 02:48:15,621
SAM: Sure.

1877
02:48:15,621 --> 02:48:20,667
TALIESIN: That's a three jpeg, man. Sorry.

1878
02:48:20,667 --> 02:48:25,039
MATT: So you guys go off to find a tavern and
drink together?

1879
02:48:25,039 --> 02:48:26,123
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1880
02:48:26,123 --> 02:48:29,640
SAM: Yeah. We need to go have some toasts to Vax.

1881
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:32,559
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

1882
02:48:32,559 --> 02:48:34,260
MATT: All right.

1883
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:37,899
LAURA: You said Allura took Velora?

1884
02:48:37,899 --> 02:48:44,042
MATT: Yeah. Well, at this point, she's probably
still carrying her with you.

1885
02:48:44,042 --> 02:48:46,709
LAURA: Oh, okay. I thought you said Allura took
her away. Okay.

1886
02:48:46,709 --> 02:48:50,762
MATT: Yeah, because Allura took her off of you--
You know what? No, she's probably being tended to

1887
02:48:50,762 --> 02:48:53,499
at the Platinum Sanctuary at the moment, seeing to
her wounds.

1888
02:48:53,499 --> 02:48:55,849
LAURA: Did I just leave her? I feel weird just
leaving her.

1889
02:48:55,849 --> 02:48:58,109
MARISHA: She'll be fine. She'll be safe.

1890
02:48:58,109 --> 02:48:59,881
TRAVIS: She's in some pretty solid hands.

1891
02:48:59,881 --> 02:49:03,483
LAURA: I'll run back and talk to her.

1892
02:49:03,483 --> 02:49:08,693
MATT: Okay. So you head back into the Sanctuary
and retrieve her.

1893
02:49:08,693 --> 02:49:14,106
LAURA: I'm going to make sure her wounds were
tended because she was pretty busted up.

1894
02:49:14,106 --> 02:49:21,191
MATT: She was. Thankfully, there are a number of
clerics and healers available that can take a

1895
02:49:21,191 --> 02:49:26,554
moment away from the wounded of the battle to deal
with a little girl. And when you come to her,

1896
02:49:26,554 --> 02:49:30,595
she's still a bit battered and bruised. But she's
all right.

1897
02:49:30,595 --> 02:49:38,668
LAURA: Is there anyone who can send me to
Syngorn?

1898
02:49:38,668 --> 02:49:42,771
TALIESIN: Why doesn't she stay with us for a
while?

1899
02:49:42,771 --> 02:49:47,094
MATT: You're asking this of anybody at the
temple?

1900
02:49:47,094 --> 02:49:49,581
LAURA: Do you think we should--

1901
02:49:49,581 --> 02:49:52,168
SAM: We can take a day.

1902
02:49:52,168 --> 02:49:58,084
TALIESIN: I think maybe a little time spent in our
company, as opposed to your father's company,

1903
02:49:58,084 --> 02:50:00,962
would not be the worst idea.

1904
02:50:00,962 --> 02:50:06,273
LAURA: Maybe a message of Sending. Can anyone do
that? Pike? Do you have the message of Sending?

1905
02:50:06,273 --> 02:50:07,962
SAM: To whom?

1906
02:50:07,962 --> 02:50:09,247
LAURA: To my father.

1907
02:50:09,247 --> 02:50:12,161
MARISHA: To let him know that his daughter is
still alive.

1908
02:50:12,161 --> 02:50:15,103
ASHLEY: I don't have it with me, but I--

1909
02:50:15,103 --> 02:50:18,161
LAURA: Okay. Allura, you've done it before.

1910
02:50:18,161 --> 02:50:20,723
MATT: "Yes."

1911
02:50:20,723 --> 02:50:23,224
LAURA: Could you send something to my father?

1912
02:50:23,224 --> 02:50:26,836
MATT: "I could. I could also bring her there, if
you'd like."

1913
02:50:26,836 --> 02:50:32,201
LAURA: No. Velora, would you want to go home right
now?

1914
02:50:32,201 --> 02:50:43,270
MATT: Right now she's holding onto your neck a
bit. She looks at you. "I miss you."

1915
02:50:43,270 --> 02:50:45,537
LAURA: I miss you too.

1916
02:50:45,537 --> 02:50:46,805
MATT: "Can I stay a bit longer?"

1917
02:50:46,805 --> 02:50:47,683
LAURA: Okay.

1918
02:50:47,683 --> 02:50:48,580
MATT: "Okay."

1919
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:50,077
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

1920
02:50:50,077 --> 02:51:00,206
LAURA: I think so too. Allura, will you say that
Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit

1921
02:51:00,206 --> 02:51:03,332
very soon to return her?

1922
02:51:03,332 --> 02:51:10,616
MATT: "I believe that," and for a moment she looks
just beyond your eyes, squints, "he's aware."

1923
02:51:10,616 --> 02:51:12,529
LAURA: Thank you.

1924
02:51:12,529 --> 02:51:16,738
MATT: "So to drinks?"

1925
02:51:16,738 --> 02:51:19,510
LAURA and TALIESIN: To drinks.

1926
02:51:19,510 --> 02:51:25,379
MATT: "I don't really drink. But after a day like
today, I think I need one."

1927
02:51:25,379 --> 02:51:26,944
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1928
02:51:26,944 --> 02:51:28,802
LAURA: Apple juice for you, little one!

1929
02:51:28,802 --> 02:51:33,563
MATT: She giggles in your ear. All right.

1930
02:51:33,563 --> 02:51:36,340
LAURA: I'm bringing my sister to a bar.

1931
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:37,985
SAM: Your nearly dead sister.

1932
02:51:37,985 --> 02:51:40,358
MARISHA: Yeah. She's going to have to be
introduced at some point.

1933
02:51:40,358 --> 02:51:44,391
MATT: Yeah. Allura takes a moment and squints her
eyes for a second, apparently Sending another

1934
02:51:44,391 --> 02:51:53,545
message, and then nodding. She leads you guys
towards the Quadroads, and finds a pub called The

1935
02:51:53,545 --> 02:52:04,410
Quarry's End. And it's not too far from Sarenrae's
temple, which is why she chose it, and it looks to

1936
02:52:04,410 --> 02:52:09,974
be like it was near a quarry that was built into
the mountain that either dried up or was closed

1937
02:52:09,974 --> 02:52:15,194
down for some reason, and then a tavern was opened
instead as a means of still making money. It's

1938
02:52:15,194 --> 02:52:25,615
super dive-y, it smells of stained wood and
spilled wine. It's musty and perfect. And as you

1939
02:52:25,615 --> 02:52:30,566
all come in, it's mostly empty, as people are
still in the process of trying to figure things

1940
02:52:30,566 --> 02:52:33,585
out. The few that are in there appear to be
wounded soldiers that, as opposed to getting

1941
02:52:33,585 --> 02:52:38,168
medical help, are in the process of drinking
themselves into a numb state. But you find a

1942
02:52:38,168 --> 02:52:49,573
table, you sit down, one of the barmaids comes up
to you, goes: "Drinking away the fray, are you?"

1943
02:52:49,573 --> 02:52:52,879
TALIESIN: I put, like, 20 gold on the table.

1944
02:52:52,879 --> 02:52:54,625
MATT: "Oh!"

1945
02:52:54,625 --> 02:53:01,583
TALIESIN: We will take the cheapest, worst beer
you have, and a round for everyone in the bar.

1946
02:53:01,583 --> 02:53:04,919
MATT: "But of course, sir! My pleasure!" Takes the
coin.

1947
02:53:04,919 --> 02:53:06,351
TALIESIN: If everyone's all right with that.

1948
02:53:06,351 --> 02:53:07,557
LAURA: Of course, dear.

1949
02:53:07,557 --> 02:53:13,476
TRAVIS: Can I also start pulling out the remaining
eight expensive-ass bottles of wine from the bag

1950
02:53:13,476 --> 02:53:14,559
of holding?

1951
02:53:14,559 --> 02:53:18,390
MARISHA: Hell yeah! Drunk as shit! Now's the
time!

1952
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:26,301
MATT: Within moments, your table is covered in
terrible beer and really expensive wine!

1953
02:53:26,301 --> 02:53:27,805
TRAVIS: Expensive-ass!

1954
02:53:27,805 --> 02:53:29,364
LAURA: That's what you wrote down, too.

1955
02:53:29,364 --> 02:53:31,003
TRAVIS: Expensive-ass bottles of wine.

1956
02:53:31,003 --> 02:53:34,306
MATT: You pull two tables together and you guys
are in the process-- You're a fair bit into your

1957
02:53:34,306 --> 02:53:42,108
cups, and then the somewhat ajar door on the
exterior slams open as the light filters in from

1958
02:53:42,108 --> 02:53:46,548
the outside, and there you see standing the
general half-height of an armored halfling,

1959
02:53:46,548 --> 02:53:51,168
partially bloodied, armor dented as shit.

1960
02:53:51,168 --> 02:53:52,582
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Kima!

1961
02:53:52,582 --> 02:53:56,946
MATT: Kima, as she walks in, sauntering in, with
her blade being sheathed in the back

1962
02:53:56,946 --> 02:54:02,627
of her giant scabbard, her Holy Avenger. "Got your
message, honey! Not going to pass up a drink after a

1963
02:54:02,627 --> 02:54:09,181
"day like this!" (cracking) "Ow, ow, ow!" She comes
and sits down next to Allura and puts her arm

1964
02:54:09,181 --> 02:54:15,344
around her real fast. "This is new!" and points to
the drink in front of Allura.

1965
02:54:15,344 --> 02:54:17,887
TALIESIN: It's a special occasion.

1966
02:54:17,887 --> 02:54:19,524
MARISHA: We're bad influences.

1967
02:54:19,524 --> 02:54:21,343
TRAVIS: Yeah. Desperate times and all that.

1968
02:54:21,343 --> 02:54:23,782
MATT: "Good. I guess that's why we're friends."

1969
02:54:23,782 --> 02:54:26,028
MARISHA: I see you're working the late shift.

1970
02:54:26,028 --> 02:54:31,452
MATT: "Well, you know. When there's streets
crawling with skeletons, I got to be there."

1971
02:54:31,452 --> 02:54:33,884
TALIESIN: Been having a good time, then?

1972
02:54:33,884 --> 02:54:41,204
MATT: "Oh, it's been amazing! It's been terrible!
Terrible. But amazing!"

1973
02:54:41,204 --> 02:54:43,285
MARISHA: Well, we frontloaded our hours.

1974
02:54:43,285 --> 02:54:45,064
LAURA: Can we have another cup?

1975
02:54:45,064 --> 02:54:53,061
MATT: "Yeah!" The barmaid comes by, gets another
cup, and leaves you guys all to drink and swap stories.

1976
02:54:53,061 --> 02:54:56,709
TALIESIN: That thing that I was bugging you
about?

1977
02:54:56,709 --> 02:55:00,139
MARISHA: Which one? You bug me about a lot of
things.

1978
02:55:00,139 --> 02:55:06,824
TALIESIN: Well, that's fair. Now that I have a bit
of alcohol in me.

1979
02:55:06,824 --> 02:55:10,784
MARISHA: Yeah, and you ask me after I have a bit
of alcohol in me. And I scry on Cassandra.

1980
02:55:10,784 --> 02:55:12,686
MATT: Okay.

1981
02:55:12,686 --> 02:55:18,095
TALIESIN: Oh god, he flipped a page. I hate that.

1982
02:55:18,095 --> 02:55:24,579
MATT: You take a long, deep sip of your drink and
then close your eyes as you complete the scrying

1983
02:55:24,579 --> 02:55:31,729
ritual you've half-scrawled on the dark wood wall
on the side of the tavern. Your vision goes

1984
02:55:31,729 --> 02:55:37,231
cloudy, and you feel yourself being transitioned
rapidly through wind and cloud as the temperature

1985
02:55:37,231 --> 02:55:41,632
of your atmosphere begins to drop, and there, you
begin to break cloud cover to look down upon

1986
02:55:41,632 --> 02:55:43,014
Whitestone.

1987
02:55:43,014 --> 02:55:49,944
Your vision jumps once more to the exterior of the
castle, jumps once more, and there you see, lying

1988
02:55:49,944 --> 02:55:59,044
in bed, covers pulled up to her chest, with at
least three different servants and one medical

1989
02:55:59,044 --> 02:56:07,289
personnel there at her side, bag open, tending to
her wounds. She's asleep, but she's breathing.

1990
02:56:07,289 --> 02:56:14,163
MARISHA: Looks like she's been tended to like a
proper de Rolo.

1991
02:56:14,163 --> 02:56:18,163
LAURA: Did you see Kaylie and Gilmore?

1992
02:56:18,163 --> 02:56:19,394
MARISHA: Did I see Kaylie and Gilmore?

1993
02:56:19,394 --> 02:56:20,574
MATT: Not in the room, no.

1994
02:56:20,574 --> 02:56:23,188
TALIESIN: She made it back to Whitestone. One
would assume that's how she got there.

1995
02:56:23,188 --> 02:56:30,846
MARISHA: She was not doing well. Gilmore was the
most able-bodied. I'm assuming he got her there. I hope.

1996
02:56:30,846 --> 02:56:34,183
TALIESIN: I'm sure. I have faith.

1997
02:56:34,183 --> 02:56:37,510
MARISHA: I'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow.

1998
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:40,807
TALIESIN: I'm drunk. Don't get used to it.

1999
02:56:40,807 --> 02:56:43,601
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Faithless until the end.

2000
02:56:43,601 --> 02:56:50,415
MARISHA: Thank you, Percy.

2001
02:56:50,415 --> 02:56:52,487
PERCY: Thank you, Keyleth.

2002
02:56:52,487 --> 02:57:00,132
MARISHA: You taught me just the right amount of
how to be a shithead. Just enough.

2003
02:57:00,132 --> 02:57:07,725
SAM: We should toast to Vax'ildan, our fallen
member.

2004
02:57:07,725 --> 02:57:12,498
MATT: At which point, Kima goes, "Yeah, where is
that asshole, anyway?"

2005
02:57:12,498 --> 02:57:14,219
SAM: He's really stealthy.

2006
02:57:14,219 --> 02:57:17,565
MATT: "Ain't that the truth. All right." She grabs
her cup.

2007
02:57:17,565 --> 02:57:21,970
LAURA: Apple juice.

2008
02:57:21,970 --> 02:57:25,501
MATT: She's holding a cup.

2009
02:57:25,501 --> 02:57:27,852
SAM: What do you have, Ashley?

2010
02:57:27,852 --> 02:57:35,358
ASHLEY: I have a cup, and it's a vintage cup. I
don't need to talk about this.

2011
02:57:35,358 --> 02:57:40,172
(laughter)

2012
02:57:40,172 --> 02:57:45,392
MATT: Glasses raised, and at this point as the
glasses are raised, you can hear whispers off to

2013
02:57:45,392 --> 02:57:49,934
the side. You glance over, and you can see one of
the nearby tables, which is filled with four

2014
02:57:49,934 --> 02:57:53,675
Bastions who had been drinking to the battle and
have now taken notice and seemingly recognized

2015
02:57:53,675 --> 02:57:58,607
who's at the table across the way. They're all
staring, and they all grab their glasses and raise

2016
02:57:58,607 --> 02:58:00,169
them, too.

2017
02:58:00,169 --> 02:58:03,704
LAURA: To Vax'ildan. He was the best of us.

2018
02:58:03,704 --> 02:58:06,904
MARISHA: The most selfless.

2019
02:58:06,904 --> 02:58:10,661
SAM: The most frequently naked.

2020
02:58:10,661 --> 02:58:14,348
MARISHA: Second to you.

2021
02:58:14,348 --> 02:58:16,808
TRAVIS: The most frustrating.

2022
02:58:16,808 --> 02:58:19,105
TALIESIN: The brightest and the darkest.

2023
02:58:19,105 --> 02:58:22,965
SAM: That's true. To Vax.

2024
02:58:22,965 --> 02:58:34,619
ALL: To Vax.

2025
02:58:34,658 --> 02:58:39,456
MATT: "So. What comes next?"

2026
02:58:39,456 --> 02:58:42,160
TRAVIS: What does come next?

2027
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:54,218
MARISHA: (sighs) It's hard to think after a day
that feels like a week, like today.

2028
02:58:54,218 --> 02:59:01,794
LAURA: Syngorn and Whitestone, I would assume.

2029
02:59:01,794 --> 02:59:06,923
TALIESIN: Home for a bit, at least. And of course,
<i>everybody</i> is welcome, always.

2030
02:59:06,923 --> 02:59:09,682
MARISHA: I've got to get back to Zephrah.

2031
02:59:09,682 --> 02:59:12,623
SAM: Do we have to check on Greyskull Keep?

2032
02:59:12,623 --> 02:59:14,552
LAURA: In Emon?

2033
02:59:14,552 --> 02:59:15,747
SAM: I don't know.

2034
02:59:15,747 --> 02:59:17,185
LAURA: Someone should stay there.

2035
02:59:17,185 --> 02:59:21,144
TRAVIS: We left it as an outpost. I wouldn't mind
going back to Whitestone for a bit.

2036
02:59:21,144 --> 02:59:30,480
TALIESIN: I'll also say, for those of you,
especially. Grog, you have your freedoms, and if

2037
02:59:30,480 --> 02:59:36,563
you wanted to become lord of Greystone and have a
place of your own that you could invite us to, as

2038
02:59:36,563 --> 02:59:38,343
opposed to wandering.

2039
02:59:38,343 --> 02:59:39,353
MARISHA: Greyskull?

2040
02:59:39,353 --> 02:59:40,642
TALIESIN: Greyskull.

2041
02:59:40,642 --> 02:59:46,475
TRAVIS: (hesitant noises)

2042
02:59:46,475 --> 02:59:48,475
LAURA: Or you could just hang in Whitestone.

2043
02:59:48,475 --> 02:59:52,514
TRAVIS: I'll think about it. It seems like that
has responsibilities.

2044
02:59:52,514 --> 02:59:55,440
LAURA: The Grand Poobah has a lot of
responsibilities, too.

2045
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:58,342
TRAVIS: I do. There is an updated tour.

2046
02:59:58,342 --> 03:00:07,582
SAM: We'll go to Whitestone and figure it out.
That's where Kaylie is, right? We assume.

2047
03:00:07,582 --> 03:00:09,405
LAURA: Potentially.

2048
03:00:09,405 --> 03:00:11,675
MARISHA: I don't think I can go back to Whitestone
with you.

2049
03:00:11,675 --> 03:00:12,880
LAURA: Why?

2050
03:00:12,880 --> 03:00:15,643
SAM: Oh, why? You've got to go back to your
people?

2051
03:00:15,643 --> 03:00:17,269
MARISHA: I have to go back to Zephrah.

2052
03:00:17,269 --> 03:00:22,025
TALIESIN: Well, I think we're going to need help
getting to Whitestone, and then I think it's going

2053
03:00:22,025 --> 03:00:27,538
to take at least a day for you to regain the power
to return to your people.

2054
03:00:27,538 --> 03:00:30,971
MARISHA: Bad influences, all of you. Assholes.

2055
03:00:30,971 --> 03:00:34,593
TALIESIN: We're not getting rid of you quite that
easily.

2056
03:00:34,593 --> 03:00:39,264
MARISHA: All right. One day.

2057
03:00:39,264 --> 03:00:41,129
TRAVIS: If you can bear it.

2058
03:00:41,129 --> 03:00:45,910
MARISHA: And then I want to not see your faces for
a bit.

2059
03:00:45,910 --> 03:00:49,641
SAM: Sure, that makes sense. Pikey-poo, where are
you going?

2060
03:00:49,641 --> 03:00:57,200
ASHLEY: Well, I'd like to come with you guys for a
little bit because frankly, I don't really want to

2061
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:59,177
be alone for a while.

2062
03:00:59,177 --> 03:01:00,857
TALIESIN: I don't think any of us do.

2063
03:01:00,857 --> 03:01:02,721
TRAVIS: I pull her into the biggest hug.

2064
03:01:02,721 --> 03:01:04,990
ASHLEY: Oh, P-- oh, Grog.

2065
03:01:04,990 --> 03:01:12,074
TRAVIS: You almost called me your own name. It's
okay. You'll be fine.

2066
03:01:12,074 --> 03:01:16,973
ASHLEY: I was going to call you Poobah, but then I
wanted to say your real name.

2067
03:01:16,973 --> 03:01:26,414
MARISHA: We could go back to Whitestone whenever.
I've still got a little bit of juice left.

2068
03:01:26,414 --> 03:01:28,669
LAURA: You've got enough juice to get us to
Whitestone right now?

2069
03:01:28,669 --> 03:01:31,665
MARISHA: I do, believe it or fucking not.

2070
03:01:31,665 --> 03:01:35,278
TRAVIS: I don't. You gave us the option.

2071
03:01:35,278 --> 03:01:36,770
MARISHA: What?

2072
03:01:36,770 --> 03:01:39,683
TRAVIS: You said believe it or fucking not. I call
nope.

2073
03:01:39,683 --> 03:01:47,760
MARISHA: Oh, it was more of a rhetorical-- it's
like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to

2074
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:50,029
explain things to him? I haven't learned.

2075
03:01:50,029 --> 03:01:51,892
ASHLEY: Because he's learning.

2076
03:01:51,892 --> 03:01:55,287
MATT: Kima's clasping her cup and goes, "I can
watch this all day."

2077
03:01:55,287 --> 03:01:57,168
TRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.

2078
03:01:57,168 --> 03:02:00,105
ASHLEY: He learns something new every day.

2079
03:02:00,105 --> 03:02:03,412
TALIESIN: How did Whitestone look?

2080
03:02:03,412 --> 03:02:10,544
MATT: It's blurred at a distance. Aside from the
specific target of your scrying, you don't get

2081
03:02:10,544 --> 03:02:13,426
much of a vision, just an idea of the blurry
exterior.

2082
03:02:13,426 --> 03:02:15,508
LAURA: Should we drunkenly walk to the tree?

2083
03:02:15,508 --> 03:02:19,069
SAM: Are we transporting tonight? Why don't we
chill for a night?

2084
03:02:19,069 --> 03:02:21,065
LAURA: Don't you want to see your daughter?

2085
03:02:21,065 --> 03:02:23,515
SAM: Well, of course, but I'm drunk and bloody.

2086
03:02:23,515 --> 03:02:31,210
MARISHA: We can drunkenly walk there and take our
time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh!

2087
03:02:31,210 --> 03:02:32,300
Scanlan--

2088
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:33,498
SAM: Did you have a drink?

2089
03:02:33,498 --> 03:02:34,526
MARISHA: Scanlan.

2090
03:02:34,526 --> 03:02:36,133
SAM: What can we do?

2091
03:02:36,133 --> 03:02:46,301
MARISHA: We can do little arcane cantrips when no
one's looking and break the rules a little bit. Of

2092
03:02:46,301 --> 03:02:48,614
Vasselheim. Just cantrips, though.

2093
03:02:48,614 --> 03:02:50,141
SAM: You're such a rebel.

2094
03:02:50,141 --> 03:02:51,170
MARISHA: I know.

2095
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:53,145
TALIESIN: I forgot.

2096
03:02:53,145 --> 03:02:54,679
MARISHA: What?

2097
03:02:54,679 --> 03:02:55,930
TALIESIN: No, you're fine.

2098
03:02:55,930 --> 03:02:56,838
MARISHA: What?

2099
03:02:56,838 --> 03:02:59,585
TALIESIN: Nothing. You're fine. Love you very
much.

2100
03:02:59,585 --> 03:03:03,435
MARISHA: I've lost the love of my life today. I'm
allowed to be belligerent.

2101
03:03:03,435 --> 03:03:04,607
TALIESIN: You are.

2102
03:03:04,607 --> 03:03:06,261
TRAVIS: Are we throwing caution to the wind?

2103
03:03:06,261 --> 03:03:07,506
SAM: Sure.

2104
03:03:07,506 --> 03:03:11,636
TRAVIS: I do have something that might up the
party a little bit.

2105
03:03:11,636 --> 03:03:12,905
SAM: Okay, what is it?

2106
03:03:12,905 --> 03:03:15,885
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I pull
out a little leather pouch.

2107
03:03:15,885 --> 03:03:17,340
MARISHA: Do you have that sandkheg shit?

2108
03:03:17,340 --> 03:03:18,471
LAURA: No.

2109
03:03:18,471 --> 03:03:19,498
TRAVIS: What?

2110
03:03:19,498 --> 03:03:20,907
SAM: What is that? What have you got?

2111
03:03:20,907 --> 03:03:27,762
TRAVIS: So I've got this little deck of cards and
every time someone pulls from it, great shit

2112
03:03:27,762 --> 03:03:29,041
happens.

2113
03:03:29,041 --> 03:03:31,067
ASHLEY: I'm in.

2114
03:03:31,067 --> 03:03:36,511
TRAVIS: One. Two. Scanlan?

2115
03:03:36,511 --> 03:03:44,286
SAM: I've seen this before, haven't I? I think I
was with you when you got the guy rich. Wasn't I?

2116
03:03:44,286 --> 03:03:46,129
MATT: No, he was on his own.

2117
03:03:46,129 --> 03:03:48,380
TRAVIS: He's the Lord of the Quadroads now.

2118
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:50,377
SAM: I was with him when he did one of them,
though.

2119
03:03:50,377 --> 03:03:55,453
MATT: You're semi-aware that there's something
going on. Make an arcana check.

2120
03:03:55,453 --> 03:03:58,153
TALIESIN: Oh, this could go so badly.

2121
03:03:58,153 --> 03:04:01,277
SAM: 15.

2122
03:04:01,277 --> 03:04:05,668
MATT: 15. Something creeping in the back of your
mind, something you've learned, something you've

2123
03:04:05,668 --> 03:04:11,106
heard, really tells you that this is powerful and
chaotic.

2124
03:04:11,106 --> 03:04:16,174
SAM: I'll watch for now.

2125
03:04:16,174 --> 03:04:17,596
TRAVIS: You'll partake.

2126
03:04:17,596 --> 03:04:18,830
SAM: Probably.

2127
03:04:18,830 --> 03:04:22,617
TRAVIS: Three. Percy?

2128
03:04:22,617 --> 03:04:27,980
TALIESIN: I think I've had enough for one day.

2129
03:04:27,980 --> 03:04:31,316
SAM: If we're going to do that, we should go back
to Whitestone first.

2130
03:04:31,316 --> 03:04:36,197
TRAVIS: Why? This place is already fucked up.
Let's get it on. Keyleth?

2131
03:04:36,197 --> 03:04:44,699
MARISHA: I am drunk enough to where I'm not going
to stop it or argue against it, but I won't

2132
03:04:44,699 --> 03:04:47,040
partake, so that's pretty good for me.

2133
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:50,488
TRAVIS: Why are you so resistant to gifts and
wonder? Magic?

2134
03:04:50,488 --> 03:04:55,940
MARISHA: Grog, you've had two weapons speak to
you--

2135
03:04:55,940 --> 03:04:57,658
TRAVIS: Don't be jelly.

2136
03:04:57,658 --> 03:05:02,510
LAURA: Nothing powerful comes without a price. We
saw that. We just saw that with the Raven Queen.

2137
03:05:02,510 --> 03:05:07,698
Power comes at a price. You think that wonderful
things are going to be pulled out of your hands

2138
03:05:07,698 --> 03:05:09,984
here, and there's going to be no consequences?

2139
03:05:09,984 --> 03:05:11,241
TRAVIS: Pretty much.

2140
03:05:11,241 --> 03:05:15,552
MARISHA: Grog, haven't we been through enough shit
to know nothing's free?

2141
03:05:15,552 --> 03:05:17,741
TRAVIS: What?

2142
03:05:17,741 --> 03:05:19,347
MARISHA: Fuck it.

2143
03:05:19,347 --> 03:05:23,397
TRAVIS: Here or Whitestone?

2144
03:05:23,397 --> 03:05:25,363
TALIESIN: Oh, definitely not at Whitestone.

2145
03:05:25,363 --> 03:05:26,999
TRAVIS: All right. Pike, you want one?

2146
03:05:26,999 --> 03:05:31,438
(laughter)

2147
03:05:31,438 --> 03:05:33,763
TALIESIN: I've always worried about the two of
you.

2148
03:05:33,763 --> 03:05:44,567
ASHLEY: Well, I think you should pick a card, and
we deal with one as of right now. And then maybe

2149
03:05:44,567 --> 03:05:46,965
I'll pick one later.

2150
03:05:46,965 --> 03:05:51,905
TRAVIS: Well, jeez, I thought we were all having
tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures

2151
03:05:51,905 --> 03:05:56,931
and writing our name on the bathroom walls, but it
seems like everybody's lost their nerve. I put it

2152
03:05:56,931 --> 03:05:59,238
back in the bag of holding.

2153
03:05:59,238 --> 03:06:01,677
(laughter and groaning)

2154
03:06:01,677 --> 03:06:02,977
MATT: You're such an asshole!

2155
03:06:02,977 --> 03:06:04,830
TALIESIN: You're such a dick.

2156
03:06:04,830 --> 03:06:08,030
LAURA: Don't do it!

2157
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:13,118
MARISHA: You insult our resolve and hold out on us
all at the same time?

2158
03:06:13,118 --> 03:06:15,252
TRAVIS: The night's still young.

2159
03:06:15,252 --> 03:06:17,417
ASHLEY: Ugh, just pick one!

2160
03:06:17,417 --> 03:06:19,226
MATT: All right.

2161
03:06:19,226 --> 03:06:22,718
SAM: We're traveling now? We're drunk!

2162
03:06:22,718 --> 03:06:24,039
MARISHA: Yeah!

2163
03:06:24,039 --> 03:06:27,038
TALIESIN: Let's drive a tree. It'll be fun.

2164
03:06:27,038 --> 03:06:32,592
MATT: You all wander outside of the tavern, find
your way over to the nearest tree that's

2165
03:06:32,592 --> 03:06:35,428
functional. It takes you a little bit, because a
lot of trees look thicker at a distance when

2166
03:06:35,428 --> 03:06:37,449
you're drunk than when you approach.

2167
03:06:37,449 --> 03:06:41,160
MARISHA: Yeah, no, this one won't work. No, this
won't work. Sorry.

2168
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:42,978
TALIESIN: That's more of a shrub.

2169
03:06:42,978 --> 03:06:45,298
MARISHA: Sorry. Next one. That one looks good.

2170
03:06:45,298 --> 03:06:46,728
TALIESIN: Yes, that looks nice.

2171
03:06:46,728 --> 03:06:48,418
SAM: That's a young boy.

2172
03:06:48,418 --> 03:06:52,189
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

2173
03:06:52,189 --> 03:06:57,261
MATT: Eventually, you find the tree that'll work,
which is interesting, because you have this

2174
03:06:57,261 --> 03:07:03,166
combination of people that are recognizing you as
Vox Machina, as the whispered saviors of the town

2175
03:07:03,166 --> 03:07:08,700
as you drunkenly stumble through the city streets,
naught but hours after sealing a recently ascended

2176
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:17,223
god. It's strangely so perfect for you. As you
approach the tree that you find that'll work,

2177
03:07:17,223 --> 03:07:29,829
Allura has her arm over Kima. She's a lightweight.
"You go on ahead. We need to help here with the

2178
03:07:29,829 --> 03:07:33,105
"construction effort."

2179
03:07:33,105 --> 03:07:36,094
LAURA: You've got to get your construction on?

2180
03:07:36,094 --> 03:07:39,370
MATT: "No, we're just--" And then Kima goes,
"Yes!"

2181
03:07:39,370 --> 03:07:42,699
TRAVIS: (laughing) She doesn't handle that booze
very well.

2182
03:07:42,699 --> 03:07:52,413
MATT: "We'll see you soon. Travel safe, and thank
you."

2183
03:07:52,413 --> 03:07:55,152
SAM: Love you.

2184
03:07:55,152 --> 03:07:57,976
MATT: "Okay."

2185
03:07:57,976 --> 03:08:01,894
(laughter)

2186
03:08:01,894 --> 03:08:08,345
MATT: Kima drags her hand. Kima's drank far more,
but is sober. She can hold her liquor. "All right,

2187
03:08:08,345 --> 03:08:12,846
"thank you, guys!" And grabs her hand and pulls her
off, and they both wave bye as they step back into

2188
03:08:12,846 --> 03:08:14,304
the city.

2189
03:08:14,304 --> 03:08:22,586
You complete your spell, emerging from the
exterior of the Sun Tree. Back in Whitestone, the

2190
03:08:22,586 --> 03:08:30,288
comfort is here once more. It seems to be just
past dusk at this point.

2191
03:08:30,288 --> 03:08:45,105
MARISHA: (slurred) See? When you travel-- wait,
no. When you travel west to east, you gain time. See?

2192
03:08:45,105 --> 03:08:47,293
SAM: Yeah, you called it.

2193
03:08:47,293 --> 03:08:49,016
ASHLEY: Time travel.

2194
03:08:49,016 --> 03:08:54,843
MARISHA: (slurred) Happy hour is right now in
Whitestone. Just saying.

2195
03:08:54,843 --> 03:08:56,956
TALIESIN: Let's head home?

2196
03:08:56,956 --> 03:08:58,415
SAM: That works.

2197
03:08:58,415 --> 03:09:00,592
MARISHA: Okay. Heading home works.

2198
03:09:00,592 --> 03:09:05,575
MATT: You guys make your way to the castle. Food
is presented. Everyone's happy to see you back.

2199
03:09:05,575 --> 03:09:08,420
What do you want to do?

2200
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:13,667
SAM: Now or forever?

2201
03:09:13,667 --> 03:09:15,808
MATT: Oh, we'll get to the forever bit in a
minute.

2202
03:09:15,808 --> 03:09:19,657
MARISHA: Cry myself to sleep?

2203
03:09:19,657 --> 03:09:24,137
SAM: I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's
around. Are we hanging out together, or are we

2204
03:09:24,137 --> 03:09:25,599
breaking off?

2205
03:09:25,599 --> 03:09:27,379
LAURA: (quietly) Go see your daughter.

2206
03:09:27,379 --> 03:09:28,763
SAM: All right. I'm going to go see Kaylie.

2207
03:09:28,763 --> 03:09:33,668
MATT: Okay. Asking around a bit, it doesn't take
much to find Kaylie in your old room in

2208
03:09:33,668 --> 03:09:41,316
Whitestone, the one where you both left when you
first exited the group for a short time. She's in

2209
03:09:41,316 --> 03:09:49,790
there, bandaged up, and looks like she's taking a
dagger and throwing it into the wall, then walking

2210
03:09:49,790 --> 03:09:56,405
over and pulling it back out, sitting back on the
bed and throwing it, and it bounces off. The hilt

2211
03:09:56,405 --> 03:10:00,958
hits. She's like, "Fuck." Picks it back up and
doesn't notice you in the doorway. As she sits

2212
03:10:00,958 --> 03:10:03,367
back down, she looks over.

2213
03:10:03,367 --> 03:10:07,242
SAM: Hi.

2214
03:10:07,242 --> 03:10:09,480
MATT: "Hi."

2215
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:13,826
SAM: You with a dagger in your hand's always a
little scary.

2216
03:10:13,826 --> 03:10:16,596
MATT: "Why, does it frighten you?"

2217
03:10:16,596 --> 03:10:19,622
SAM: Not any--

2218
03:10:19,622 --> 03:10:20,630
MATT: "Boo!"

2219
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:23,334
SAM: (yelps) Okay, it frightens me a little.

2220
03:10:23,334 --> 03:10:26,882
MATT: She sheathes it on the side.

2221
03:10:26,882 --> 03:10:28,832
SAM: You okay?

2222
03:10:28,832 --> 03:10:37,191
MATT: "I've had better days. I'm all right."

2223
03:10:37,191 --> 03:10:38,511
SAM: Good.

2224
03:10:38,511 --> 03:10:39,908
MATT: "You're alive."

2225
03:10:39,908 --> 03:10:45,614
SAM: Surprisingly, yes. We won.

2226
03:10:45,614 --> 03:10:50,686
MATT: "I figured, if you're standing here before
me. That's good. Congratulations."

2227
03:10:50,686 --> 03:10:59,534
SAM: Thanks. I'm sorry that I had to go do that. I
had to.

2228
03:10:59,534 --> 03:11:04,299
MATT: "I'd be disappointed if you'd've came back
with me. More important things."

2229
03:11:04,299 --> 03:11:15,399
SAM: So what now? Do you want to go back to
Ank'Harel and keep criming?

2230
03:11:15,399 --> 03:11:27,537
MATT: You watch for a brief second her tough
exterior break, and you can see her eyes welling

2231
03:11:27,537 --> 03:11:40,203
up a little bit. She looks at the ground for a
minute, then looks back up at you. "I'm glad

2232
03:11:40,203 --> 03:11:42,898
"you're safe."

2233
03:11:42,898 --> 03:11:51,771
SAM: I'm so happy I got to see you again. I
thought for a second that when we said goodbye, it

2234
03:11:51,771 --> 03:11:54,141
was the last time.

2235
03:11:54,141 --> 03:12:04,747
MATT: "I didn't. I know you too well, at this
point. You're too much of a turd to die."

2236
03:12:04,747 --> 03:12:13,435
SAM: That's true. Only good people die.

2237
03:12:13,435 --> 03:12:25,613
MATT: "I'd like to go back to Ank'Harel. I don't
know if this whole Meat Man thing's for me

2238
03:12:25,613 --> 03:12:26,958
"anymore."

2239
03:12:26,958 --> 03:12:34,823
SAM: Yeah. No, I hear you. I don't know if it's
for me, either. It was fun.

2240
03:12:34,823 --> 03:12:37,177
MATT: "It was a lot of fun!"

2241
03:12:37,177 --> 03:12:46,137
SAM: It felt like we were killing time a little
bit. There's something else that we should do. I

2242
03:12:46,137 --> 03:12:49,926
don't know what. Maybe your thing won't be my
thing.

2243
03:12:49,926 --> 03:12:54,179
MATT: "Let's find someone to pass on the mantle
to, eh?"

2244
03:12:54,179 --> 03:12:55,973
SAM: That's a good idea.

2245
03:12:55,973 --> 03:12:59,157
MATT: "I think the Meat Man should be there, just
not us."

2246
03:12:59,157 --> 03:13:04,371
SAM: Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll train a
replacement.

2247
03:13:04,371 --> 03:13:09,768
MATT: "Still take a percentage. I mean, we worked
this hard!"

2248
03:13:09,768 --> 03:13:14,852
SAM: Passive income, right? It's the dream.

2249
03:13:14,852 --> 03:13:17,505
MATT: "It's the meat and potatoes of any good
business venture."

2250
03:13:17,505 --> 03:13:19,629
SAM: I should have thought of that. That's
amazing.

2251
03:13:19,629 --> 03:13:28,777
MATT: "That's why the daughter's an upgrade. After
that, I don't know. I hate to admit it, but--"

2252
03:13:28,777 --> 03:13:31,823
SAM: Did you finish school?

2253
03:13:31,823 --> 03:13:33,819
MATT: "No."

2254
03:13:33,819 --> 03:13:36,250
SAM: Do you want to?

2255
03:13:36,250 --> 03:13:43,541
MATT: "Yeah."

2256
03:13:43,541 --> 03:13:54,370
SAM: All right. Well, let's do that, then. You go
to school.

2257
03:13:54,370 --> 03:14:14,316
MATT: "I'm not really made for a lyceum. We can go
visit. I didn't expect you to recommend

2258
03:14:14,316 --> 03:14:16,505
"schooling!"

2259
03:14:16,505 --> 03:14:24,952
SAM: Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my
life, and I don't want you to make the same ones.

2260
03:14:24,952 --> 03:14:36,002
I love you, and I want to support you in whatever
you want to do, at this point. My time has come,

2261
03:14:36,002 --> 03:14:44,142
and I've done my thing, and my thing is done, and
now I want to help you do whatever it is that you

2262
03:14:44,142 --> 03:14:55,628
want to do. If that means I can be close to you,
then great, but if it doesn't, then I'll come

2263
03:14:55,628 --> 03:15:01,983
visit every once in a while. We made quite a bit
of money as the Meat Man.

2264
03:15:01,983 --> 03:15:04,081
MATT: "Aye, that we did."

2265
03:15:04,081 --> 03:15:08,700
SAM: And it's a good sum to get started.

2266
03:15:08,700 --> 03:15:14,165
MATT: "Would it be enough to pay for a right
top-end education so I can gloat over all the

2267
03:15:14,165 --> 03:15:21,897
"other kids that are raised by the various lords
and ladies of Emon? Become one of those privileged kids."

2268
03:15:21,897 --> 03:15:24,716
SAM: You can have the best education.

2269
03:15:24,716 --> 03:15:29,309
MATT: "That's what I want to do. I want to rub it
in their face."

2270
03:15:29,309 --> 03:15:36,660
SAM: All right. Education for spite. I like that.

2271
03:15:36,660 --> 03:15:41,292
MATT: "That sounds like a Shorthalt endeavor."

2272
03:15:41,292 --> 03:15:44,737
SAM: Sure. Whatever you need.

2273
03:15:44,737 --> 03:15:50,000
MATT: She stands up from the bed and walks over
and puts her hand on your shoulder in a pat, pat.

2274
03:15:50,000 --> 03:16:02,025
She pulls you into a hug and rests her head on
your shoulder and doesn't say anything.

2275
03:16:02,025 --> 03:16:06,218
SAM: You won't have to worry about me anymore.

2276
03:16:06,218 --> 03:16:09,776
MATT: "I'm going to worry about you every day."

2277
03:16:09,776 --> 03:16:18,457
SAM: Thank you. Thank you for coming into my
life.

2278
03:16:18,457 --> 03:16:23,340
MATT: "Thank you for being enough of a shitbag to
bring me into it."

2279
03:16:23,340 --> 03:16:33,170
SAM: I'm so happy. I made so many mistakes, but it
turns out that some of them weren't mistakes,

2280
03:16:33,170 --> 03:16:35,337
after all.

2281
03:16:35,337 --> 03:16:45,865
MATT: "I'm still young and unlearned. Time will
tell." She pulls you a little tighter in.

2282
03:16:45,865 --> 03:16:51,346
SAM: I'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at
some point.

2283
03:16:51,346 --> 03:16:59,401
MATT: She smells the alcohol on your breath and
(groans). "Go lie there. I'm going to--" (groans)

2284
03:16:59,401 --> 03:17:11,002
She winces as her wound in her shoulder flares up.
"I need some fresh air. You go to sleep."

2285
03:17:11,002 --> 03:17:19,474
Exhaustion hits you, and you end up passing out at
the foot of the bed.

2286
03:17:19,474 --> 03:17:21,351
SAM: I'm in my room now?

2287
03:17:21,351 --> 03:17:23,814
MATT: Yeah, your old room.

2288
03:17:23,814 --> 03:17:29,963
LAURA: I'm going to tuck Velora into bed.

2289
03:17:29,963 --> 03:17:35,577
MATT: She's asleep by the time you get there.
Travel and everything has tuckered her out. You

2290
03:17:35,577 --> 03:17:38,799
tuck her in, put the blanket up.

2291
03:17:38,799 --> 03:17:46,343
LAURA: I tiptoe out of the room, and I find
Percy.

2292
03:17:46,343 --> 03:17:48,545
TALIESIN: I'll be in Cassandra's room.

2293
03:17:48,545 --> 03:17:52,247
LAURA: Percival?

2294
03:17:52,247 --> 03:17:53,739
TALIESIN: Yes?

2295
03:17:53,739 --> 03:17:56,592
LAURA: Could I talk to you for a moment?

2296
03:17:56,592 --> 03:17:58,102
TALIESIN: Of course.

2297
03:17:58,102 --> 03:18:10,629
LAURA: I completely understand if you want to stay
with Cassandra for the night. Would you mind not being

2298
03:18:10,629 --> 03:18:17,472
very comfortable, though? I was thinking of
camping in the woods.

2299
03:18:17,472 --> 03:18:29,504
TALIESIN: I think that sounds lovely, and you're
always better than comfortable. I had a thought,

2300
03:18:29,504 --> 03:18:47,722
actually. My god, it is hard surviving, isn't it?
Perhaps Keyleth could use a friend right now, and

2301
03:18:47,722 --> 03:18:51,666
I know that you carry one with you.

2302
03:18:51,666 --> 03:18:54,006
LAURA: Trinket?

2303
03:18:54,006 --> 03:19:05,640
TALIESIN: Just for a bit. I think she could use a
companion who's not going to apologize or give too

2304
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:07,361
much sympathy.

2305
03:19:07,361 --> 03:19:14,721
LAURA: Of course. I send Trinket to Keyleth's
room.

2306
03:19:14,721 --> 03:19:18,385
MATT: As Trinket ascends the stairs, he looks back
over the shoulder. (questioning noise)

2307
03:19:18,385 --> 03:19:25,340
LAURA: She might cry a lot on you. All right,
dear?

2308
03:19:25,340 --> 03:19:30,415
MATT: Makes it up the stairs.

2309
03:19:30,415 --> 03:19:35,571
LAURA: It's going to be a lot harder to stay warm
out in the woods now.

2310
03:19:35,571 --> 03:19:41,904
TALIESIN: We'll figure something out. I grew up
here. I'm used to it.

2311
03:19:41,904 --> 03:19:51,426
LAURA: I wanted to remember how I used to camp
with Vax when we were kids.

2312
03:19:51,426 --> 03:19:55,318
TALIESIN: I'd like to see that.

2313
03:19:55,318 --> 03:20:04,893
LAURA: I guess we go out and set up a little
fire.

2314
03:20:04,893 --> 03:20:10,408
MATT: You guys make your way into the woods and
set up a camp for the evening's rest together.

2315
03:20:10,408 --> 03:20:24,526
Keyleth, are you in your room? The door (creaks)
and Trinket comes in and stares right at you.

2316
03:20:24,526 --> 03:20:33,527
(slurps) And licks up the side of your face. Your
hair sticks up for a minute.

2317
03:20:33,527 --> 03:20:35,330
MARISHA: Oh, buddy!

2318
03:20:35,330 --> 03:20:42,567
MATT: (bear noises) He leans in and plops down on
the ground, a giant beanbag mound of bear fur.

2319
03:20:42,567 --> 03:20:56,166
MARISHA: I cover Trinket with snot and tears as I
sob into his belly. First night alone, but with

2320
03:20:56,166 --> 03:20:57,244
Trinket.

2321
03:20:57,244 --> 03:20:58,894
TALIESIN: Best teddy bear ever.

2322
03:20:58,894 --> 03:21:01,840
MARISHA: Aware of the gesture. I cry.

2323
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:07,134
MATT: Eventually the exhaustion and the alcohol
hits you, and you fall asleep, cuddled up in the

2324
03:21:07,134 --> 03:21:12,372
warm embrace of a very fantastic, recently
meteor-struck bear.

2325
03:21:12,372 --> 03:21:17,043
MARISHA: Drool and eyeliner and dirt.

2326
03:21:17,043 --> 03:21:21,376
MATT: Voice of the Tempest.

2327
03:21:21,376 --> 03:21:24,177
SAM: You were wearing eyeliner to our fight?

2328
03:21:24,177 --> 03:21:28,765
MARISHA: Remember, I charcoal war-painted?

2329
03:21:28,765 --> 03:21:30,669
SAM: That makes sense.

2330
03:21:30,669 --> 03:21:33,842
TRAVIS: Has everybody gone off?

2331
03:21:33,842 --> 03:21:37,253
MATT: Pike actually would still be around.

2332
03:21:37,253 --> 03:21:45,126
TRAVIS: I make my way sneakily outside.

2333
03:21:45,126 --> 03:21:47,125
MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

2334
03:21:47,125 --> 03:21:52,913
ASHLEY: There's a couple of things.

2335
03:21:52,913 --> 03:21:56,188
TALIESIN: There's a lovely tea rose garden in the
back.

2336
03:21:56,188 --> 03:21:58,958
SAM: She's letting Grog go first.

2337
03:21:58,958 --> 03:22:00,582
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

2338
03:22:00,582 --> 03:22:05,986
ASHLEY: If you wanted to go somewhere, sneak
away.

2339
03:22:05,986 --> 03:22:09,032
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, I was just gonna, um.

2340
03:22:09,032 --> 03:22:17,238
MATT: Who wants to go first? Pike? Grog? Who's
going first?

2341
03:22:17,238 --> 03:22:24,966
ASHLEY: Just for a little bit, for about an hour,
I want to go-- not deep into the woods where

2342
03:22:24,966 --> 03:22:34,986
Percy and Vex are, but somewhere that's pretty for
about an hour, and I'll make my way back.

2343
03:22:34,986 --> 03:22:44,804
MATT: As you're out there on your own,
contemplating quietly, ruminating on the day, a

2344
03:22:44,804 --> 03:22:53,830
faint howl finds the air, and stepping from the
shadows, you see a large gray wolf: Galdric, the

2345
03:22:53,830 --> 03:22:59,913
wolf that once belonged to the previous champion
of the Raven Queen, Purvan, who was given charge

2346
03:22:59,913 --> 03:23:07,428
over the forests on the outside. Saunters up to
you. He is a large wolf. You are a tiny gnome. He

2347
03:23:07,428 --> 03:23:15,114
steps up, sits next to you.

2348
03:23:15,114 --> 03:23:22,643
In this little break in the trees where you can
see the moon breaking through some of the passing

2349
03:23:22,643 --> 03:23:28,415
clouds over Whitestone. The night is so cold, you
can see your breath in the dark air through the

2350
03:23:28,415 --> 03:23:35,566
beams of moonlight that make it through the
canopy. As the wolf looks down at you, his intense

2351
03:23:35,566 --> 03:23:44,460
eyes making a full scan of what you are, there's a
recognition to his expression. The wolf looks back

2352
03:23:44,460 --> 03:23:58,435
up. (howls) And gives a long, baleful howl,
seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that

2353
03:23:58,435 --> 03:24:05,945
one with a familiar path to his has found his way
back to the realm of the Raven Queen, as well.

2354
03:24:05,945 --> 03:24:22,758
ASHLEY: You are a beautiful creature. This might
be strange, but I give him a hug.

2355
03:24:22,758 --> 03:24:31,713
MATT: You hug Galdric. You're used to Trinket,
who's pretty well manicured. Galdric, not so much.

2356
03:24:31,713 --> 03:24:36,865
There are clusters of fur that are
dirt-encrusted.

2357
03:24:36,865 --> 03:24:38,662
TRAVIS: Shit in them.

2358
03:24:38,662 --> 03:24:47,100
MATT: Probably. He's not a full, ruined beast. He
lives in the forest. Smells of earth, dust, and

2359
03:24:47,100 --> 03:24:52,601
nature. Doesn't seem to react to your hug, but
allows it.

2360
03:24:52,601 --> 03:24:57,000
ASHLEY: I sit next to him.

2361
03:24:57,000 --> 03:25:02,644
MATT: He seems to share the space with you for the
time that you're in the forest. Not a strong

2362
03:25:02,644 --> 03:25:07,194
connection, but an acknowledgement, mainly
focusing on the moon before it passes through the

2363
03:25:07,194 --> 03:25:09,254
canopy and is no longer visible.

2364
03:25:09,254 --> 03:25:18,564
ASHLEY: I came out here to build a little
something, so I'm glad to have you out here for a

2365
03:25:18,564 --> 03:25:26,057
little bit. Thank you for staying with me.

2366
03:25:26,057 --> 03:25:31,101
MATT: The one ear to the side perks open to listen
to your statement, but the vision doesn't meet

2367
03:25:31,101 --> 03:25:38,514
yours, still focused in space as it fades. You get
the essence that the wolf acknowledges you.

2368
03:25:38,514 --> 03:25:54,959
ASHLEY: (sighs) I feel like Grog would be so happy
right now to be around a wolf. I give him a

2369
03:25:54,959 --> 03:25:56,894
scratch behind his ear.

2370
03:25:56,894 --> 03:26:02,651
MATT: He actually seems to enjoy it and gives into
it. One of the giant hind legs of the wolf--

2371
03:26:02,651 --> 03:26:11,797
ASHLEY: Oh, that's a good boy. I give out a little
howl.

2372
03:26:11,797 --> 03:26:16,744
MATT: He howls along with you. (howls)

2373
03:26:16,744 --> 03:26:21,300
ASHLEY: That was for my friend Vax.

2374
03:26:21,300 --> 03:26:33,885
MATT: The wolf gets up, circles you once, and
makes his way into the darkness of the forest once more.

2375
03:26:33,885 --> 03:26:44,833
ASHLEY: Goodbye. After a bit, I head back.

2376
03:26:44,833 --> 03:26:47,623
MATT: Okay. Grog?

2377
03:26:47,623 --> 03:26:53,697
TRAVIS: I wander outside, where I'm by myself. Do
I see anyone?

2378
03:26:53,697 --> 03:26:56,385
MATT: Make a perception check.

2379
03:26:56,385 --> 03:27:00,558
TRAVIS: Like it matters. Oh! 17.

2380
03:27:00,558 --> 03:27:06,113
MATT: Glancing about, there are some of the Pale
Guard around. Nobody that you would be looking

2381
03:27:06,113 --> 03:27:09,741
for, necessarily. You seem to be open to do as you
please.

2382
03:27:09,741 --> 03:27:25,487
SAM: Yeah.

2383
03:27:25,487 --> 03:27:27,309
TRAVIS: I pull a card.

2384
03:27:27,309 --> 03:27:28,486
SAM: Yes!

2385
03:27:28,486 --> 03:27:31,986
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

2386
03:27:31,986 --> 03:27:33,992
MARISHA: Wait, where are you?

2387
03:27:33,992 --> 03:27:35,826
LAURA: Outside of the castle.

2388
03:27:35,826 --> 03:27:38,690
MARISHA: In the middle of fucking Whitestone?

2389
03:27:38,690 --> 03:27:40,716
MATT: Oh my god, Grog.

2390
03:27:40,716 --> 03:27:43,735
ASHLEY: Wait, as I'm walking back, do I see him at
all?

2391
03:27:43,735 --> 03:27:48,259
MATT: (chuckles) Out in front of the castle, out
in the courtyard area?

2392
03:27:48,259 --> 03:27:50,645
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's nighttime.

2393
03:27:50,645 --> 03:27:52,314
MATT: Make a perception check, Pike.

2394
03:27:52,314 --> 03:27:53,909
SAM: Make it good.

2395
03:27:53,909 --> 03:27:55,948
TALIESIN: Roll a natural 20.

2396
03:27:55,948 --> 03:27:59,915
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20.

2397
03:27:59,915 --> 03:28:01,594
MARISHA: Shut your mouth!

2398
03:28:01,594 --> 03:28:05,003
TRAVIS: I rolled a bunch of hit dice from our
short rest.

2399
03:28:05,003 --> 03:28:12,093
MATT: As you're quietly climbing up the walkway to
the base of Castle Whitestone--

2400
03:28:12,093 --> 03:28:13,812
ASHLEY: He's out in the open.

2401
03:28:13,812 --> 03:28:18,352
MATT: Yeah. You do. You look up and see Grog pull
a card from the deck.

2402
03:28:18,352 --> 03:28:21,430
ASHLEY: I stand and watch for a moment.

2403
03:28:21,430 --> 03:28:22,962
SAM: Oh, here's the deck.

2404
03:28:22,962 --> 03:28:27,380
LAURA: Oh my god. It is really happening. I can't
fucking believe--

2405
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:35,699
MARISHA: Travis, pull good! Oh, please don't bring
pit fiends on our heads.

2406
03:28:35,699 --> 03:28:38,059
TRAVIS: I might have.

2407
03:28:38,059 --> 03:28:40,463
SAM: Negative two to everything.

2408
03:28:40,463 --> 03:28:47,452
MATT: Hold on. Deck of Many Things. All right, so.
Grog, what did you pull?

2409
03:28:47,452 --> 03:28:54,096
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

2410
03:28:54,096 --> 03:28:55,489
MATT: Void.

2411
03:28:55,489 --> 03:28:56,951
TALIESIN: Oh no!

2412
03:28:56,951 --> 03:28:58,688
MARISHA: That can't be good.

2413
03:28:58,688 --> 03:29:00,299
MATT: I'm sure it's fine.

2414
03:29:00,299 --> 03:29:02,581
LAURA: That's the worst one you could get!

2415
03:29:02,581 --> 03:29:08,242
SAM: The crew's laughing. Something's bad.
Something's very bad.

2416
03:29:08,242 --> 03:29:09,715
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure--

2417
03:29:09,715 --> 03:29:12,255
LAURA: That is so bad!

2418
03:29:12,255 --> 03:29:17,155
TALIESIN: Oh my god! (laughs)

2419
03:29:17,155 --> 03:29:18,772
SAM: Wait, Pike saw him.

2420
03:29:18,772 --> 03:29:19,974
MATT: Pike.

2421
03:29:19,974 --> 03:29:21,995
SAM: You get a reaction.

2422
03:29:21,995 --> 03:29:24,888
MARISHA: Did our internet go?

2423
03:29:24,888 --> 03:29:30,656
(screaming and groaning)

2424
03:29:30,656 --> 03:29:32,582
MATT: Of all moments.

2425
03:29:32,582 --> 03:29:39,470
TALIESIN: (cackles) This is your doing!

2426
03:29:39,470 --> 03:29:47,187
MATT: While we're here, Grog, I'm going to read
you the card. This black card spells disaster.

2427
03:29:47,187 --> 03:29:53,298
Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in
an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or

2428
03:29:53,298 --> 03:29:56,766
more powerful beings guard the place. While your
soul is trapped in this way, your body is

2429
03:29:56,766 --> 03:30:01,209
incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your
soul, but the spell reveals the location of the

2430
03:30:01,209 --> 03:30:03,750
object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

2431
03:30:03,750 --> 03:30:07,645
SAM: Wait, read it again.

2432
03:30:07,645 --> 03:30:14,961
TRAVIS: I'll tell you. My soul is drawn from my
body. My body is incapacitated. It is placed

2433
03:30:14,961 --> 03:30:21,947
within an object that the DM chooses. A Wish spell
will tell you the location of the object, but will

2434
03:30:21,947 --> 03:30:24,038
not reverse the action.

2435
03:30:24,038 --> 03:30:25,833
SAM: Can anything reverse it?

2436
03:30:25,833 --> 03:30:28,790
MATT: Finding it and retrieving the object and
restoring the soul.

2437
03:30:28,790 --> 03:30:33,333
MARISHA: You fucking dick. You're a fucking dick!

2438
03:30:33,333 --> 03:30:38,915
LAURA: Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I
can't believe you just fucking did that.

2439
03:30:38,915 --> 03:30:41,534
SAM: Wait, she rolled.

2440
03:30:41,534 --> 03:30:42,911
LAURA: Ashley?

2441
03:30:42,911 --> 03:30:46,031
SAM: She rolled something. Oh, that was her 20
from before.

2442
03:30:46,031 --> 03:30:51,660
MATT: Looks like we may have her back. Hopefully,
because this is going to be-- oh my god.

2443
03:30:51,660 --> 03:30:59,582
MARISHA: It is bad!

2444
03:30:59,582 --> 03:31:03,499
SAM: Oh my god, Travis. Why would you do that?

2445
03:31:03,499 --> 03:31:09,326
MATT: Give me the card. Let this be a lesson to
everybody out there.

2446
03:31:09,326 --> 03:31:11,075
LAURA: Oh my god!

2447
03:31:11,075 --> 03:31:18,960
MARISHA: You said you weren't going to bring the Deck
of Many Things into the game, and then you did!

2448
03:31:18,960 --> 03:31:22,059
MATT: No regrets.

2449
03:31:22,059 --> 03:31:23,913
TALIESIN: Hashtag no regrets.

2450
03:31:23,913 --> 03:31:26,263
MATT: No "regerts" at all.

2451
03:31:26,263 --> 03:31:30,898
TALIESIN: Oh god, I can't even.

2452
03:31:30,898 --> 03:31:32,922
LAURA: Is Ashley texting?

2453
03:31:32,922 --> 03:31:35,945
TALIESIN: She's just yelling obscenities.

2454
03:31:35,945 --> 03:31:37,391
SAM: Her internet just died.

2455
03:31:37,391 --> 03:31:43,871
MARISHA: (mispronouncing) Worst fucking timing!
Internet has gone! Timing! Worst fucking timing!

2456
03:31:43,871 --> 03:31:46,966
TALIESIN: It's just obscenities. That's all it
is.

2457
03:31:46,966 --> 03:32:00,282
MATT: So Grog, as you draw the card from the deck,
your vision goes tunneled, dark, to a pinpoint: a

2458
03:32:00,282 --> 03:32:11,461
singular pinpoint of deep, ruby red. And that's
all. Your consciousness falls into a catatonic state.

2459
03:32:11,461 --> 03:32:13,330
SAM: Does she get a reaction or anything?

2460
03:32:13,330 --> 03:32:14,533
MATT: No.

2461
03:32:14,533 --> 03:32:16,187
MARISHA: She doesn't get shit? She just watches?

2462
03:32:16,187 --> 03:32:18,188
MATT: She sees it happen.

2463
03:32:18,188 --> 03:32:19,577
SAM: With her 20, she saw!

2464
03:32:19,577 --> 03:32:20,960
MATT: I know. She's aware.

2465
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:22,685
SAM: She can't yell? She can't cast something?

2466
03:32:22,685 --> 03:32:30,195
MATT: No, because he pulled the card. It's not a
big (grunts). It's a (flip).

2467
03:32:30,195 --> 03:32:31,442
SAM: All right.

2468
03:32:31,442 --> 03:32:36,836
MATT: All righty, so.

2469
03:32:36,836 --> 03:32:41,915
MARISHA: I guess we'll add that to our to do list.

2470
03:32:41,915 --> 03:32:45,553
TALIESIN: I'd like to think that in the next
campaign, we're going to find you in a glass

2471
03:32:45,553 --> 03:32:47,428
coffin like Sleeping fucking Beauty.

2472
03:32:47,428 --> 03:32:48,864
MARISHA: Yeah.

2473
03:32:48,864 --> 03:32:50,941
TRAVIS: My body's still there.

2474
03:32:50,941 --> 03:32:52,713
SAM: She rolled a 17.

2475
03:32:52,713 --> 03:32:55,197
MARISHA: So Grog's body is still there--

2476
03:32:55,197 --> 03:32:57,499
MATT: He's catatonic until the soul's returned.

2477
03:32:57,499 --> 03:32:59,119
MARISHA: Catatonic.

2478
03:32:59,119 --> 03:33:06,888
MATT: To be fair, you've sealed Vecna. At level 19
and 20, this is not going to be an

2479
03:33:06,888 --> 03:33:08,868
earth-shattering experience.

2480
03:33:08,868 --> 03:33:10,030
MARISHA: Sure, it's just an annoyance.

2481
03:33:10,030 --> 03:33:17,717
MATT: And for the sake of the epilogue evening:
you guys, all planning to return to your various

2482
03:33:17,717 --> 03:33:19,685
lives to relax--

2483
03:33:19,685 --> 03:33:23,359
TRAVIS: I'm there catatonic with an open deck of
cards in my hand like this.

2484
03:33:23,359 --> 03:33:27,738
LIAM: You dingus!

2485
03:33:27,738 --> 03:33:30,256
MARISHA: Goddamn it!

2486
03:33:30,256 --> 03:33:32,289
TRAVIS: Somebody's going to find me.

2487
03:33:32,289 --> 03:33:39,166
SAM: To Grog! He was the dumbest of us all. He was
the dumb and the dumb.

2488
03:33:39,166 --> 03:33:41,885
TALIESIN: May he rest in bed sores for all
eternity.

2489
03:33:41,885 --> 03:33:46,457
MATT: You spend the next two weeks finding your
way through the halls of Pandemonium.

2490
03:33:46,457 --> 03:33:48,423
LAURA: I can't fucking believe that shit.

2491
03:33:48,423 --> 03:33:50,628
MARISHA: Wait, we spend two weeks?

2492
03:33:50,628 --> 03:33:52,363
SAM: The halls of Pandemonium?

2493
03:33:52,363 --> 03:33:55,213
MATT: Yes, where his soul is currently
encapsulated.

2494
03:33:55,213 --> 03:33:56,858
SAM: God, you asshole.

2495
03:33:56,858 --> 03:33:58,126
MARISHA: In what?

2496
03:33:58,126 --> 03:34:02,536
TRAVIS: What are the halls of Pandemonium?

2497
03:34:02,536 --> 03:34:09,009
MARISHA: I should be <i>mourning</i> right now, and I'm
hunting your stupid ass down!

2498
03:34:09,009 --> 03:34:14,122
TRAVIS: I'm keeping you occupied. I really did
this for you.

2499
03:34:14,122 --> 03:34:19,914
MATT: Pandemonium is a plane of madness: a great
mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by

2500
03:34:19,914 --> 03:34:23,868
howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with
no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes

2501
03:34:23,868 --> 03:34:27,808
nonmagical open flames such as torches and
campfires. It also makes conversation possible

2502
03:34:27,808 --> 03:34:33,772
only by yelling, and even then only at a maximum
distance of ten feet. Most of the plane's

2503
03:34:33,841 --> 03:34:37,448
inhabitants are creatures that were banished to
the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them

2504
03:34:37,448 --> 03:34:40,876
have been driven mad by the incessant winds or
forced to take shelter in places where the winds

2505
03:34:40,876 --> 03:34:46,037
die down until they sound like distant cries of
torment. So yeah, that's a fun time. It's a fun

2506
03:34:46,037 --> 03:34:48,363
adventure you guys go on to retrieve Grog's soul.

2507
03:34:48,363 --> 03:34:50,148
MARISHA: Great therapy lesson.

2508
03:34:50,148 --> 03:34:52,233
TRAVIS: We'll one-shot it later.

2509
03:34:52,233 --> 03:34:55,443
(laughter)

2510
03:34:55,443 --> 03:34:58,463
MARISHA: A healing trip.

2511
03:34:58,463 --> 03:35:02,825
SAM: It's a good side quest for the future
someday.

2512
03:35:02,825 --> 03:35:09,687
MATT: A good moment of, "Oh, we're not going to
get a rest." Hopefully, we'll get Ashley back, but

2513
03:35:09,687 --> 03:35:18,599
in the meantime, for the purposes of this, you
come back two weeks after, extremely angry. Grog,

2514
03:35:18,599 --> 03:35:26,743
as suddenly you're restored, and that tiny bead of
light fades back, and you're not outside anymore.

2515
03:35:26,743 --> 03:35:33,409
You're actually sitting in a reclined, cushioned
couch or chair of some kind in Castle Whitestone,

2516
03:35:33,409 --> 03:35:38,657
and all of your currently living friends are all
around you, looking <i>very</i> angry.

2517
03:35:38,657 --> 03:35:40,614
TRAVIS: Oh! It got me a chair.

2518
03:35:40,614 --> 03:35:42,157
LAURA: You fucking idiot.

2519
03:35:42,157 --> 03:35:43,166
TRAVIS: What?

2520
03:35:43,166 --> 03:35:44,420
LAURA: I cannot believe you did that.

2521
03:35:44,420 --> 03:35:45,535
TRAVIS: Did what?

2522
03:35:45,535 --> 03:35:51,607
MARISHA: Keyleth backhands him with the hand that
has the most rings on it, of power.

2523
03:35:51,607 --> 03:35:55,254
TRAVIS: Do I lose any hit points?

2524
03:35:55,254 --> 03:35:57,739
MARISHA: Probably not!

2525
03:35:57,739 --> 03:36:00,067
TRAVIS: What? What happened?

2526
03:36:00,067 --> 03:36:03,334
TALIESIN: You lost card privileges.

2527
03:36:03,334 --> 03:36:04,800
SAM: Yep. Hand them over.

2528
03:36:04,800 --> 03:36:08,177
TALIESIN: Oh, we already took the whole deck.

2529
03:36:08,177 --> 03:36:09,624
TRAVIS: Wait!

2530
03:36:09,624 --> 03:36:13,705
SAM: You may lose your belt for this, friend.

2531
03:36:13,705 --> 03:36:17,937
LAURA: Yeah. You're lucky we didn't shave your
beard. Yeah.

2532
03:36:17,937 --> 03:36:20,725
TRAVIS: I fucked up.

2533
03:36:20,725 --> 03:36:22,122
LAURA: You fucked up a lot.

2534
03:36:22,122 --> 03:36:24,380
SAM: Percy lost his arm rescuing you!

2535
03:36:24,380 --> 03:36:28,895
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

2536
03:36:28,895 --> 03:36:30,140
TALIESIN: Are you?

2537
03:36:30,140 --> 03:36:31,237
TRAVIS: No.

2538
03:36:31,237 --> 03:36:34,269
(laughter)

2539
03:36:34,269 --> 03:36:41,250
TRAVIS: All right. I just thought, it did
fantastic things before! I don't know why it

2540
03:36:41,250 --> 03:36:42,833
doesn't like me so much.

2541
03:36:42,833 --> 03:36:44,777
TALIESIN: I don't think it was personal.

2542
03:36:44,777 --> 03:36:46,620
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

2543
03:36:46,620 --> 03:36:50,089
SAM: You've learned a lesson that we had to pay
for.

2544
03:36:50,089 --> 03:36:54,733
TRAVIS: All right. Sorry, guys. Sorry, Pike.

2545
03:36:54,733 --> 03:36:56,575
ASHLEY: Hello?

2546
03:36:56,575 --> 03:37:02,416
(laughter)

2547
03:37:02,416 --> 03:37:06,261
MATT: Look at that timing. I don't even know,
man.

2548
03:37:06,261 --> 03:37:08,405
SAM: Pike, can you hear us?

2549
03:37:08,405 --> 03:37:12,735
ASHLEY: My internet crashed at the <i>worst</i> fucking
time.

2550
03:37:12,735 --> 03:37:21,377
MARISHA: We can't even see you right now. You're a
silhouette on the screen, but we can hear you.

2551
03:37:21,377 --> 03:37:23,542
MATT: Pike, do you know what happened?

2552
03:37:23,542 --> 03:37:26,756
SAM: Yeah, I texted her the gist of what
happened.

2553
03:37:26,756 --> 03:37:28,200
ASHLEY: Okay, so you disappeared?

2554
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:33,242
MATT: Grog's soul was trapped somewhere on the
plane of Pandemonium, and you guys had to take two

2555
03:37:33,242 --> 03:37:39,138
weeks and battle your way through a terrible plane
filled with wind and madness and creatures that

2556
03:37:39,138 --> 03:37:43,577
were banished there to never escape, eventually
battling some terrible beast that was guarding the

2557
03:37:43,577 --> 03:37:49,338
gem that contained his soul, returned, and he just
now woke up on the couch after restoring his

2558
03:37:49,338 --> 03:37:53,558
consciousness to his body, and has been slapped in
the face by Keyleth and told that he lost card

2559
03:37:53,558 --> 03:37:54,626
privileges.

2560
03:37:54,626 --> 03:37:56,168
TRAVIS: (tearfully) And Percy lost his arm!

2561
03:37:56,168 --> 03:38:00,070
ASHLEY: Oh no. Wait, what?!

2562
03:38:00,070 --> 03:38:02,831
SAM: Well, I may have been fibbing about that
part.

2563
03:38:02,831 --> 03:38:05,898
MARISHA: It might be a cheap joke.

2564
03:38:05,898 --> 03:38:08,950
TALIESIN: I might have lost my arm or I might be
hiding it behind my back. I'm not sure.

2565
03:38:08,950 --> 03:38:14,106
TRAVIS: So news flash, pro tip: the cards may be
dangerous.

2566
03:38:14,106 --> 03:38:16,702
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

2567
03:38:16,702 --> 03:38:19,596
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe we leave it alone, then.

2568
03:38:19,596 --> 03:38:26,140
LAURA: Hey! Hi! Oh my god, that was craziness.

2569
03:38:26,140 --> 03:38:32,116
SAM: Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap
up for the evening?

2570
03:38:32,116 --> 03:38:33,735
TALIESIN: I pull a card from the deck.

2571
03:38:33,735 --> 03:38:37,013
SAM: No! I invoke the third contract.

2572
03:38:37,013 --> 03:38:43,318
MATT: I'll draw the card for you. Whichever one
smashes Whitestone.

2573
03:38:43,318 --> 03:38:45,645
TALIESIN: Suddenly, I lose everything.

2574
03:38:45,645 --> 03:38:47,707
MATT: Exactly. Oh my god, if you pull that card?

2575
03:38:47,707 --> 03:38:48,830
TALIESIN: Wouldn't that be amazing?

2576
03:38:48,830 --> 03:38:50,038
MATT: Don't you even.

2577
03:38:50,038 --> 03:38:51,122
LAURA: Penniless?

2578
03:38:51,122 --> 03:38:53,104
MATT: Everything he owns crumbles to dust.

2579
03:38:53,104 --> 03:38:54,173
TRAVIS: Everything.

2580
03:38:54,173 --> 03:38:55,363
MATT: All material wealth.

2581
03:38:55,363 --> 03:38:57,350
TALIESIN: It's why I don't pull cards!

2582
03:38:57,350 --> 03:38:59,934
MARISHA: How fucked would that be? So fucked.

2583
03:38:59,934 --> 03:39:01,372
SAM: Bring it in.

2584
03:39:01,372 --> 03:39:12,273
MATT: After this unexpected side venture, you all
say your goodbyes for the time being, scatter to

2585
03:39:12,273 --> 03:39:19,414
the various business you have to. Pike? Is there
anything else you wanted to do?

2586
03:39:19,414 --> 03:39:21,007
ASHLEY: Are we leaving?

2587
03:39:21,007 --> 03:39:25,070
MATT: Was there anything else this evening you
needed to situate? I was going to begin to

2588
03:39:25,070 --> 03:39:28,031
facilitate the epilogue.

2589
03:39:28,031 --> 03:39:29,364
SAM: What do you want to do?

2590
03:39:29,364 --> 03:39:33,836
ASHLEY: Can I grab Keyleth and Vex real quick?

2591
03:39:33,836 --> 03:39:37,739
MARISHA: Yeah. Girl power.

2592
03:39:37,739 --> 03:39:43,075
ASHLEY: I'll take them to the little spot where I
was in the woods.

2593
03:39:43,075 --> 03:39:44,668
LAURA: Two weeks ago.

2594
03:39:44,668 --> 03:39:47,781
(laughter)

2595
03:39:47,781 --> 03:39:49,947
TRAVIS: Sorry.

2596
03:39:49,947 --> 03:40:20,533
ASHLEY: Okay. So hey, I put something together.
It's dumb, but I made a bench and I put Vax's name

2597
03:40:20,533 --> 03:40:29,610
on it and I didn't want to make him a headstone
because that seems so final. Maybe he's still

2598
03:40:29,610 --> 03:40:31,202
around somewhere.

2599
03:40:31,202 --> 03:40:33,023
LAURA: He is.

2600
03:40:33,023 --> 03:40:45,991
ASHLEY: I also have these. I take out two of his
feathers that I grabbed. And I thought you could put

2601
03:40:45,991 --> 03:40:51,667
this with the feathers in your hair, Vex and
Keyleth, you could do something with this.

2602
03:40:51,667 --> 03:40:56,499
MARISHA: I think I have the perfect place for
this. Thank you.

2603
03:40:56,499 --> 03:40:58,932
LAURA: Thank you, Pike.

2604
03:40:58,932 --> 03:41:00,470
MARISHA: Thank you so much.

2605
03:41:00,470 --> 03:41:07,764
ASHLEY: I'm sure you could make it look a little
prettier than it is but--

2606
03:41:07,764 --> 03:41:09,804
MARISHA: I think it's perfect.

2607
03:41:09,804 --> 03:41:11,739
LAURA: It's absolutely perfect.

2608
03:41:11,739 --> 03:41:14,008
MARISHA: Where are we going to put it?

2609
03:41:14,008 --> 03:41:17,991
LAURA: Do you want it out in the woods?

2610
03:41:17,991 --> 03:41:20,914
ASHLEY: Maybe we should just leave it here.

2611
03:41:20,914 --> 03:41:22,243
LAURA: I like it.

2612
03:41:22,243 --> 03:41:25,035
MARISHA: I think he'd like that.

2613
03:41:25,035 --> 03:41:27,493
ASHLEY: I think he would too.

2614
03:41:27,493 --> 03:41:31,701
MARISHA: Something you have to stumble upon. It's
a little hidden.

2615
03:41:31,701 --> 03:41:33,692
LAURA: Yeah, it's stealthy!

2616
03:41:33,692 --> 03:41:36,199
MARISHA: Stealthy memorial!

2617
03:41:36,199 --> 03:41:59,335
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll let you guys stay. I just
wanted to do one more thing. Okay, I walk over to

2618
03:41:59,335 --> 03:42:01,193
where Scanlan is.

2619
03:42:01,193 --> 03:42:05,262
SAM: You mean two weeks ago or are we after--

2620
03:42:05,262 --> 03:42:09,661
MATT: No, this is after the random, unexpected
Pandemonium trip.

2621
03:42:09,661 --> 03:42:15,799
ASHLEY: Wait, is Grog on the trip or was that--

2622
03:42:15,799 --> 03:42:19,258
MATT: Well, no. You guys had to go there to find
his soul.

2623
03:42:19,258 --> 03:42:21,204
MARISHA: Grog was the reason for this season!

2624
03:42:21,204 --> 03:42:24,545
TRAVIS: To be fair, nothing really happened in
that mind.

2625
03:42:24,545 --> 03:42:26,543
MATT: That's true.

2626
03:42:26,543 --> 03:42:32,841
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan!

2627
03:42:32,841 --> 03:42:34,798
SAM: Oi, Pike.

2628
03:42:34,798 --> 03:42:37,719
ASHLEY: How are you doing?

2629
03:42:37,719 --> 03:42:41,619
SAM: Now that Percy's arm has healed, I'm fine.

2630
03:42:41,619 --> 03:42:45,777
ASHLEY: Now that was bad, wasn't it?

2631
03:42:45,777 --> 03:42:49,568
SAM: Yeah. That bugbear came out of nowhere.

2632
03:42:49,568 --> 03:42:55,109
ASHLEY: The bugbear, you said?

2633
03:42:55,109 --> 03:42:57,407
SAM: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

2634
03:42:57,407 --> 03:43:05,996
ASHLEY: I thought I forgot about that, maybe.
Listen, I'm glad you're alive.

2635
03:43:05,996 --> 03:43:11,731
SAM: Me too. Thanks for saving us all in that big
fight.

2636
03:43:11,731 --> 03:43:25,315
ASHLEY: Thank <i>you</i> for saving us all. I don't
really have a whole lot to say, I care for you a

2637
03:43:25,315 --> 03:43:34,570
lot and I wanted to let you know that.

2638
03:43:34,570 --> 03:43:52,320
SAM: I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you
since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that

2639
03:43:52,320 --> 03:43:54,557
we became friends as well.

2640
03:43:54,557 --> 03:43:56,748
ASHLEY: Me too.

2641
03:43:56,748 --> 03:44:05,100
SAM: Thank you for everything. Thank you for
putting up with me when I was a shit and I hope

2642
03:44:05,100 --> 03:44:16,543
that I've become more tolerable for you. After all
that we've been through, I was wondering if I

2643
03:44:16,543 --> 03:44:26,803
could ask you a question. I have a proposal for
you, if you don't mind. Well, now that everything

2644
03:44:26,803 --> 03:44:40,843
is safe again and back to normal, I was wondering
if I could take you on a date. To a restaurant or

2645
03:44:40,843 --> 03:44:47,664
something, then maybe if it goes well, we could go
on another date and that's it.

2646
03:44:47,664 --> 03:44:56,397
ASHLEY: Well, I actually was going to ask you the
same thing!

2647
03:44:56,397 --> 03:45:09,615
SAM: Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it!
I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you

2648
03:45:09,615 --> 03:45:11,108
on a date!

2649
03:45:11,108 --> 03:45:17,768
MARISHA: Oh.

2650
03:45:17,768 --> 03:45:20,300
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2651
03:45:20,300 --> 03:45:24,231
SAM: Oh no! The internet! Can you hear me,
Ashley?

2652
03:45:24,231 --> 03:45:26,837
(groaning)

2653
03:45:26,837 --> 03:45:28,543
SAM: Denied.

2654
03:45:28,543 --> 03:45:29,873
TALIESIN: That was amazing!

2655
03:45:29,873 --> 03:45:32,447
LAURA, MATT, and SAM: That was a yes.

2656
03:45:32,447 --> 03:45:39,348
MARISHA: It's 2017. When will we will have better
Skype?

2657
03:45:39,348 --> 03:45:41,298
TALIESIN: That's the most Scanlan thing I could
have ever hoped for.

2658
03:45:41,298 --> 03:45:51,264
MATT: Remember, we're America. We have the worst
Internet in the world. Weirdly. Net neutrality. As

2659
03:45:51,264 --> 03:46:02,991
you guys gather, say your temporary goodbyes, knowing
that you're all still very in touch with each other,

2660
03:46:02,991 --> 03:46:11,508
knowing you care about each other, you begin to forge
whatever life looks like outside of perpetual

2661
03:46:11,508 --> 03:46:25,365
danger and the constant onslaught and struggle of
terrors and heroic necessity. Scanlan.

2662
03:46:25,365 --> 03:46:30,588
SAM: Oh! Sorry, I'm having a text romance with
Ashley Johnson right now.

2663
03:46:30,588 --> 03:46:34,186
MATT: Then I'll come back to you.

2664
03:46:34,186 --> 03:46:39,265
SAM: No. I'm ready. I can pull myself away from
Pike for a second.

2665
03:46:39,265 --> 03:46:47,738
MATT: What does Scanlan do in the next year? Next
five years, next ten years?

2666
03:46:47,738 --> 03:46:57,375
SAM: (clears throat) I have one prepared. Well,
she's not here, so I don't know but I wrote down--

2667
03:46:57,375 --> 03:46:59,021
ASHLEY: Can you hear me at all?

2668
03:46:59,021 --> 03:47:01,196
SAM: Oh god, I love this!

2669
03:47:01,196 --> 03:47:07,023
ASHLEY: Sorry, my Internet keeps going out.

2670
03:47:07,023 --> 03:47:08,598
TRAVIS: It's okay.

2671
03:47:08,598 --> 03:47:11,080
LAURA: Perfect timing, Ash.

2672
03:47:11,080 --> 03:47:19,172
MATT: It's all right. So assuming that you guys
went on a date. I'm discussing with Scanlan his

2673
03:47:19,172 --> 03:47:25,138
epilogue. What does he wish to do in the next
year, five and ten years?

2674
03:47:25,138 --> 03:47:35,786
SAM: My plan, what I wrote down, was find Kaylie,
make sure she's okay. Help Pike repair Vasselheim

2675
03:47:35,786 --> 03:47:52,081
or literally whatever she wants to do. Give all
money to Kaylie except for my platinum bracelets

2676
03:47:52,081 --> 03:48:01,392
with sapphires worth 2,500 gold that I send
anonymously to Sybil to make sure she's taken care

2677
03:48:01,392 --> 03:48:18,380
of. Long term, I would like to use my
Wish/Teleport to check on Kaylie every now and

2678
03:48:18,380 --> 03:48:20,973
then, at school or wherever she ends up.

2679
03:48:20,973 --> 03:48:24,453
MATT: She ends up at the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon,
which is one of the highest places of learning.

2680
03:48:24,453 --> 03:48:28,772
You have connections to the council and with the
money that you've given her, she lords over many

2681
03:48:28,772 --> 03:48:31,428
of the children of the various nobles.

2682
03:48:31,428 --> 03:48:35,325
TALIESIN: I would have recommended my tutor, but
of course, Vax slit his throat right about the

2683
03:48:35,325 --> 03:48:38,472
time you met him. He was a good tutor before
that.

2684
03:48:38,472 --> 03:48:44,795
SAM: I don't know but we'll wait until we get to
Ashley to find out how things are going with our

2685
03:48:44,795 --> 03:48:53,010
dating. Otherwise, in my free time, I would love
to use my time to write down the epic stories of

2686
03:48:53,010 --> 03:49:00,243
Vox Machina, from our meeting to saving the world
and everything in between. It will be difficult as

2687
03:49:00,243 --> 03:49:07,277
Scanlan is not an author, but he will rely on
guidance from Ioun herself and may even ask Sprigg

2688
03:49:07,277 --> 03:49:17,143
to be a copy-editor of sorts. The working title is
"In the Belly of Dragons: The Legend of Scanlan

2689
03:49:17,143 --> 03:49:20,583
"Shorthalt and Vox Machina". Working title.

2690
03:49:20,583 --> 03:49:23,736
TRAVIS: "In the Anus of Dragons," accurately.

2691
03:49:23,736 --> 03:49:29,894
SAM: And I hope to finish the book by the time I
turn 71.

2692
03:49:29,894 --> 03:49:33,386
TRAVIS: How old are you, exactly?

2693
03:49:33,386 --> 03:49:38,192
SAM: Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69.

2694
03:49:38,192 --> 03:49:40,951
LAURA: You were <i>that</i> young?

2695
03:49:40,951 --> 03:49:42,407
SAM: Yeah.

2696
03:49:42,407 --> 03:49:44,366
LAURA: You motherfucker!

2697
03:49:44,366 --> 03:49:46,171
TALIESIN: You're full of shit.

2698
03:49:46,171 --> 03:49:48,619
LAURA: Oh my god, I can't believe you were that
young.

2699
03:49:48,619 --> 03:49:50,392
TRAVIS: This whole time?

2700
03:49:50,392 --> 03:49:55,349
LAURA: I thought you were 300 years old. Jesus.

2701
03:49:55,349 --> 03:49:56,932
TALIESIN: Just full of shit.

2702
03:49:56,932 --> 03:50:11,885
SAM: I mean, that's about it. I think every once
in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see

2703
03:50:11,885 --> 03:50:17,511
Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know
how other than to scry.

2704
03:50:17,567 --> 03:50:22,860
MATT: Which does not succeed, but you still send
your thoughts and wishes into the ether in hopes

2705
03:50:22,860 --> 03:50:27,027
that they find their way there. Okay.

2706
03:50:27,027 --> 03:50:34,525
MATT: So following off that, the story of Taryon
Darrington, which I have something written for

2707
03:50:34,525 --> 03:50:42,761
here based off what he did. Feel free to embellish
or change how you see fit. As the months pass, the

2708
03:50:42,761 --> 03:50:48,187
Darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more
humble lifestyle, and their work of charity

2709
03:50:48,187 --> 03:50:54,546
within the city of Deastok and the neighboring
lands goes far to clean up the family name from

2710
03:50:54,546 --> 03:50:57,892
where it once was. While their influence was greatly
diminished and they're essentially a political

2711
03:50:57,892 --> 03:51:03,407
laughingstock, the message of their work still
strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic

2712
03:51:03,407 --> 03:51:10,007
lords to the north and an alliance is made that
protects the Darrington name and interests from

2713
03:51:10,007 --> 03:51:19,846
the Myriad's ever wiley grasp for the time being.
Doty 3.0 now stands a shining golden color, gifted

2714
03:51:19,846 --> 03:51:24,769
the materials by a thankful ore baron whom
Taryon's Brigade of Adventurers saved from a

2715
03:51:24,769 --> 03:51:30,248
terrifying doppelgänger's plot. His troupe
continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the

2716
03:51:30,248 --> 03:51:36,759
southern lands of the Dwendalian Empire, some
good, some humorous. His mother, Mariya, ever

2717
03:51:36,759 --> 03:51:42,995
cheering them on and making their tabards for
years before passing away peacefully, proud of her

2718
03:51:42,995 --> 03:51:49,560
boy. Her passing brings the rest of the family
closer together than it's ever been. And the

2719
03:51:49,560 --> 03:51:54,761
charitable efforts, surprisingly, of Howaardt now
encompass the Darrington Brigade as a

2720
03:51:54,761 --> 03:52:03,839
non-profit adventuring league. During a gambling run
in Port Demali to follow, Taryon stumbles upon a

2721
03:52:03,839 --> 03:52:12,180
now slightly more haggard Lawrence, now working as
a tanner. They immediately fell right back where

2722
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:20,488
they left off and Lawrence cashed in his life as a
leather worker to join the Brigade alongside Taryon.

2723
03:52:20,488 --> 03:52:23,609
LAURA: Oh! That's so great!

2724
03:52:23,609 --> 03:52:25,490
SAM: I love it!

2725
03:52:25,490 --> 03:52:28,193
MATT: Anything you wish to add to that?

2726
03:52:28,193 --> 03:52:38,087
SAM: No, I had written a letter, but yours is much
better. Yeah, that's great.

2727
03:52:38,087 --> 03:52:40,672
LAURA: You wrote a letter?

2728
03:52:40,672 --> 03:52:43,180
SAM: I didn't know how much Matt was going to
put.

2729
03:52:43,180 --> 03:52:44,725
MATT: You could still read the letter.

2730
03:52:44,725 --> 03:52:45,975
SAM: I can read the end of the letter.

2731
03:52:45,975 --> 03:52:47,248
MATT: Okay.

2732
03:52:47,248 --> 03:52:50,317
MARISHA: Oh, Sam.

2733
03:52:50,317 --> 03:52:57,806
SAM: No, it's fine. You did good.

2734
03:52:57,806 --> 03:53:02,684
MATT: I didn't mean to step on anything
you did.

2735
03:53:02,684 --> 03:53:06,514
SAM: No, you did great. Much better.

2736
03:53:06,514 --> 03:53:15,960
MATT: Pike. Wilhand spends his twilight years
helping with small tasks around the emerging House

2737
03:53:15,960 --> 03:53:23,791
of the Everlight as it is built on the northern
edge of Westruun before age finally takes him in

2738
03:53:23,791 --> 03:53:29,545
peace amongst friends and family. The red-brick
house you grew up in and Grog grew along with you

2739
03:53:29,545 --> 03:53:36,276
for a while is left in your name and there you
know you have ever a homestead in Westruun in

2740
03:53:36,276 --> 03:53:40,459
memory of Wilhand and the friendships you forged.
What else would you like to do? What else do

2741
03:53:40,459 --> 03:53:52,783
you wish to achieve, Pike, as the years go on?
That could pertain to you and whatever

2742
03:53:52,783 --> 03:53:55,418
relationship with Scanlan you wish to embellish
on.

2743
03:53:55,418 --> 03:53:57,633
SAM: Should we roll for dating?

2744
03:53:57,633 --> 03:53:59,878
(laughter)

2745
03:53:59,878 --> 03:54:03,303
MATT: There's a chart somewhere in second
edition.

2746
03:54:03,303 --> 03:54:14,231
ASHLEY: I don't know what Grog's plans are, but I
do know if there were any adventuring to be had,

2747
03:54:14,231 --> 03:54:21,317
that her and Grog got to on some adventures
together.

2748
03:54:21,317 --> 03:54:23,055
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2749
03:54:23,055 --> 03:54:33,031
ASHLEY: And that he always has a place in my home
and I know I would love to-- I'm sure at this

2750
03:54:33,031 --> 03:54:56,895
point, fully rebuild the temple in Vasselheim. I
think things have gone well with Scanlan. Oh man,

2751
03:54:56,895 --> 03:54:58,386
I'm getting so emotional.

2752
03:54:58,386 --> 03:55:01,287
SAM: Like second-base well or even better than
that?

2753
03:55:01,287 --> 03:55:12,256
ASHLEY: Well, I think if we spend enough time
together, maybe, I don't know, can we see what

2754
03:55:12,256 --> 03:55:16,158
else life has for us together?

2755
03:55:16,158 --> 03:55:19,916
SAM: Absolutely.

2756
03:55:19,916 --> 03:55:24,760
ASHLEY: That doesn't have to mean anything more. I
know your life, what you like to do and I'll give

2757
03:55:24,760 --> 03:55:26,074
you freedom.

2758
03:55:26,074 --> 03:55:35,264
SAM: No, I think the most free I've ever been is
with you.

2759
03:55:35,264 --> 03:55:48,814
ASHLEY: I think there's no one I would rather
spend the rest of my days with, besides my pal Grog.

2760
03:55:48,814 --> 03:55:51,267
I think you get a two-for-one deal!

2761
03:55:51,267 --> 03:55:54,280
SAM: Sure. The weird family dynamic.

2762
03:55:54,280 --> 03:55:58,532
TRAVIS: You guys keep it quiet up there, please?

2763
03:55:58,532 --> 03:56:06,251
SAM: Weird roommates. Giant lower floor, tiny
upper floor.

2764
03:56:06,251 --> 03:56:10,201
LIAM: The ceiling is one inch above your head.

2765
03:56:10,201 --> 03:56:25,113
ASHLEY: I think at some point, I ask Scanlan for
his hand in marriage.

2766
03:56:25,113 --> 03:56:32,424
SAM: I mean, I would have to ask Wilhand for his
permission.

2767
03:56:32,424 --> 03:56:34,375
MATT: He passed away.

2768
03:56:34,375 --> 03:56:38,101
SAM: Well then, I would go leave some flowers at
the grave.

2769
03:56:38,101 --> 03:56:41,749
TRAVIS: You can ask me.

2770
03:56:41,749 --> 03:56:56,761
SAM: Oh, I will ask Grog for permission. Grog, as
the father figure in our weird household, I would

2771
03:56:56,761 --> 03:57:04,308
like to ask for your permission to wed your
not-daughter, Pike, who is much smarter and older

2772
03:57:04,308 --> 03:57:06,229
than you.

2773
03:57:06,229 --> 03:57:11,179
TRAVIS: You're a scoundrel. Do you have any
money?

2774
03:57:11,179 --> 03:57:14,658
SAM: I have this little black rock that you gave
me.

2775
03:57:14,658 --> 03:57:24,986
TRAVIS: That's worth literally nothing. How about
you give her this? And I take out the rare black

2776
03:57:24,986 --> 03:57:29,094
sapphire and put it in your hand.

2777
03:57:29,094 --> 03:57:31,871
SAM: That's pretty good.

2778
03:57:31,871 --> 03:57:36,548
TRAVIS: I'm fucking watching you, you understand?

2779
03:57:36,548 --> 03:57:40,117
SAM: I won't hurt her, I promise.

2780
03:57:40,117 --> 03:57:41,256
TRAVIS: Don't you slip up!

2781
03:57:41,256 --> 03:57:43,045
SAM: Nope, I know you could kill me in my sleep.

2782
03:57:43,045 --> 03:57:47,939
TRAVIS: I know. I usually put dead people in the
bag of holding, but there's always a first! Treat

2783
03:57:47,939 --> 03:57:48,992
her right.

2784
03:57:48,992 --> 03:57:52,512
SAM: Would you walk me down the aisle and by walk
me down the aisle, I mean carry me down the aisle?

2785
03:57:52,512 --> 03:57:59,998
(laughter)

2786
03:57:59,998 --> 03:58:02,477
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yes.

2787
03:58:02,477 --> 03:58:05,891
SAM: All right, let's have a group weird hug.

2788
03:58:05,891 --> 03:58:14,623
MATT: Aw. All righty. Anything else, Pike? Are you
happy with that?

2789
03:58:14,623 --> 03:58:16,724
SAM: Do I have to convert, Pike?

2790
03:58:16,724 --> 03:58:18,722
ASHLEY: What's that?

2791
03:58:18,722 --> 03:58:21,249
SAM: Do I have to convert? I'm an Iounian.

2792
03:58:21,249 --> 03:58:22,227
ASHLEY: No.

2793
03:58:22,227 --> 03:58:23,308
SAM: Okay, I'm good.

2794
03:58:23,308 --> 03:58:26,357
LAURA: You're Iounish?

2795
03:58:26,357 --> 03:58:28,878
ASHLEY: Sarenrae's very accepting of other gods.

2796
03:58:28,878 --> 03:58:31,192
SAM: Multi-faith ceremony. There you go.

2797
03:58:31,192 --> 03:58:34,973
MARISHA: 16 rites of passage.

2798
03:58:34,973 --> 03:58:36,793
MATT: Anything else, Pike?

2799
03:58:36,793 --> 03:58:39,116
ASHLEY: No.

2800
03:58:39,116 --> 03:58:50,316
MATT: Okay. All right, we'll leave it at that.
Percival. Vex'ahlia. Since your fates are rather

2801
03:58:50,316 --> 03:58:53,427
intertwined, I ask you both what are your plans,
what are your plots?

2802
03:58:53,427 --> 03:58:57,158
TALIESIN: I don't really think we should settle
down. That seems like a lot.

2803
03:58:57,158 --> 03:58:59,231
LAURA: (laughs)

2804
03:58:59,231 --> 03:59:08,440
TALIESIN: I think that I would like to start a
very complicated art project that's going to take

2805
03:59:08,440 --> 03:59:14,461
many years. I'm not going to work on it all the
time, day and night, but I'm going to invest some

2806
03:59:14,461 --> 03:59:16,081
time in this.

2807
03:59:16,081 --> 03:59:17,743
LAURA: Are you going to be in your shop a lot?

2808
03:59:17,743 --> 03:59:27,090
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to build a clocktower.
Like the one in Prague. I'm going to take many

2809
03:59:27,132 --> 03:59:30,730
years and it's going to sit at the front of the
castle so it will be outside and there will be

2810
03:59:30,730 --> 03:59:43,608
other people working on it. It will, as a proper
clock does, it will tell our story. Once a year,

2811
03:59:43,608 --> 03:59:47,199
everything will play out.

2812
03:59:47,199 --> 03:59:50,157
LAURA: Holy shit. That's good.

2813
03:59:50,157 --> 03:59:58,481
TALIESIN: And we may start inviting tinkering
artisans every year for Whitestone to come show

2814
03:59:58,481 --> 04:00:09,160
off things that are not necessarily useful, but to
show off fanciful inventions and things that are

2815
04:00:09,160 --> 04:00:10,924
beautiful.

2816
04:00:10,924 --> 04:00:12,554
LAURA: I love that idea.

2817
04:00:12,554 --> 04:00:14,147
TALIESIN: But let's not stay here too often.

2818
04:00:14,147 --> 04:00:15,398
(laughter)

2819
04:00:15,398 --> 04:00:21,572
LAURA: No, although we will have to stay here for
nine months every once in a while, because I think

2820
04:00:21,572 --> 04:00:23,901
we should rebuild the families that we've lost.

2821
04:00:23,901 --> 04:00:26,205
TALIESIN: There's a lot of names.

2822
04:00:26,205 --> 04:00:28,482
LAURA and TALIESIN: So many names.

2823
04:00:28,482 --> 04:00:30,665
MATT: How many names?

2824
04:00:30,665 --> 04:00:33,237
TALIESIN: So many ways to irritate your father.

2825
04:00:33,237 --> 04:00:34,471
LAURA: Five names.

2826
04:00:34,471 --> 04:00:35,857
TALIESIN: Oh, at the very least.

2827
04:00:35,857 --> 04:00:36,960
LAURA: Five.

2828
04:00:36,960 --> 04:00:41,240
MARISHA: That's a lot of names. Very long names.

2829
04:00:41,240 --> 04:00:43,278
LIAM: At least three sets of twins.

2830
04:00:43,278 --> 04:00:45,779
(laughter)

2831
04:00:45,779 --> 04:00:47,498
TALIESIN: Jesus.

2832
04:00:47,498 --> 04:00:53,429
LAURA: I definitely want to build a statue to
Trinket, the wonder bear.

2833
04:00:53,429 --> 04:00:55,618
MARISHA: The wonder bear.

2834
04:00:55,618 --> 04:00:56,956
SAM: Is he dead?

2835
04:00:56,956 --> 04:00:58,545
LAURA: No, Trinket's around.

2836
04:00:58,545 --> 04:00:59,787
SAM: Damn it.

2837
04:00:59,787 --> 04:01:05,187
LAURA: So centuries of people in Whitestone will
remember their mascot, Trinket.

2838
04:01:05,187 --> 04:01:06,868
MARISHA: He prevents forest fires.

2839
04:01:06,868 --> 04:01:10,826
(laughter)

2840
04:01:10,826 --> 04:01:12,125
TRAVIS: Ranger's hat.

2841
04:01:12,125 --> 04:01:16,299
LAURA: As the years pass, we should start a
festival and bears will be everywhere.

2842
04:01:16,299 --> 04:01:19,652
TALIESIN: There will be. Bears will be involved in
the festival. Obviously. Especially since the

2843
04:01:19,652 --> 04:01:23,829
clock tower is part of the festival and bears
feature heavily in it.

2844
04:01:23,829 --> 04:01:24,840
LAURA: Perfect.

2845
04:01:24,840 --> 04:01:27,136
TRAVIS: Only you can prevent forest fires.

2846
04:01:27,136 --> 04:01:30,148
TALIESIN: Only you can prevent the rise of Vecna.

2847
04:01:30,148 --> 04:01:33,316
(laughter)

2848
04:01:33,316 --> 04:01:47,060
LAURA: I was hoping to never stop attempting to
contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen.

2849
04:01:47,060 --> 04:01:54,209
MATT: You do notice that the raven population of
Whitestone seems to be perpetually seeing blooms

2850
04:01:54,209 --> 04:01:57,354
every year, far more than it used to.

2851
04:01:57,354 --> 04:02:02,776
LAURA: I cast Speak with Animals on them and I
constantly try to communicate with him.

2852
04:02:02,776 --> 04:02:10,893
MATT: Okay, I mean they all seem to be ravens
happy to live in this space, but it seems to be

2853
04:02:10,893 --> 04:02:15,316
more in essence the vicinity more than a specific
raven.

2854
04:02:15,316 --> 04:02:24,876
LAURA: Would you be all right if we increased the
Pelor temple here?

2855
04:02:24,876 --> 04:02:36,285
TALIESIN: Yes, I trust your judgment. It
is not for me, but I'm definitely all right

2856
04:02:36,285 --> 04:02:38,069
with anything that makes you happy.

2857
04:02:38,069 --> 04:02:39,960
LAURA: Thank you, darling.

2858
04:02:39,960 --> 04:02:43,048
TALIESIN: To be fair, you'd do it anyway.

2859
04:02:43,048 --> 04:02:45,890
LAURA: Pretty much, yeah.

2860
04:02:45,890 --> 04:02:52,644
TALIESIN: I help Cassandra as best I can. I think
at least once a year we get out and do something

2861
04:02:52,644 --> 04:02:54,170
irresponsible.

2862
04:02:54,170 --> 04:02:55,026
LAURA: Definitely.

2863
04:02:55,026 --> 04:03:00,501
TALIESIN: Maybe sometimes drag these kids out for
shenanigans.

2864
04:03:00,501 --> 04:03:10,291
MATT: Cassandra, as a note by the way. She's had a
few pretty difficult brushes with death and the

2865
04:03:10,291 --> 04:03:15,512
experiences definitely left a mark on her.
Within the year following the battle with Vecna,

2866
04:03:15,512 --> 04:03:25,132
she begins to remind you of yourself at a very
dark time. Recognizing that, you come to her and

2867
04:03:25,132 --> 04:03:34,707
help pull her from a dangerous edge of lashing out
at the place she's worked so hard to build. You

2868
04:03:34,707 --> 04:03:41,810
help her realize that this guilt she's been
holding as being a tool of manipulation the times

2869
04:03:41,810 --> 04:03:47,892
that she has been is not her fault and used
against the ones she loves. In that determination

2870
04:03:47,892 --> 04:03:56,832
to no longer be a tool for others to use, she asks
Vex to teach her and train her. To not just be the

2871
04:03:56,832 --> 04:04:02,561
lady beacon of Whitestone, but also join in as one
of its protectors.

2872
04:04:02,561 --> 04:04:06,051
LAURA: At least she had some good promise a long
time ago.

2873
04:04:06,051 --> 04:04:15,426
MATT: "That was some time, but I've seen what you
can do and, well, I deign to think of how dangerous

2874
04:04:15,426 --> 04:04:18,592
"the three of us would be if I could reach your
level."

2875
04:04:18,592 --> 04:04:20,416
LAURA: We'll make you strong, darling.

2876
04:04:20,416 --> 04:04:24,991
TALIESIN: We also insist that she leave Whitestone
at least once a year for a period of time to do

2877
04:04:24,991 --> 04:04:26,313
fuck all.

2878
04:04:26,313 --> 04:04:30,279
LAURA: Yeah, there's a beautiful place called
Dalen's Closet. I think you would love it.

2879
04:04:30,279 --> 04:04:34,300
TALIESIN: Let's not, well yes, there's, well.

2880
04:04:34,300 --> 04:04:40,807
MATT: Anything else? You guys happy with that?

2881
04:04:40,807 --> 04:04:48,048
TALIESIN: I'm content to make a clock tower and
make art and never make another weapon. I'm good.

2882
04:04:48,048 --> 04:04:51,764
MATT: Hmm, all right.

2883
04:04:51,764 --> 04:04:58,081
LAURA: I have "Make Whitestone the tits," written
in my notes of things that I want to do.

2884
04:04:58,081 --> 04:05:03,653
TALIESIN: It's got a bear. I'm imagining the bear
from Burning Man actually.

2885
04:05:03,653 --> 04:05:05,383
MARISHA: Penny Bear.

2886
04:05:05,383 --> 04:05:07,430
LAURA: Yeah, Penny Bear. I like it.

2887
04:05:07,430 --> 04:05:11,277
MATT: There you go. Grog.

2888
04:05:11,277 --> 04:05:24,161
TRAVIS: I'm so fascinated by Vasselheim. I have so
many interests that I feel it only proper to go

2889
04:05:24,161 --> 04:05:37,393
back and turn myself in to the authorities for
punching one of the guards in the face and take

2890
04:05:37,393 --> 04:05:40,884
whatever punishment they have for me.

2891
04:05:40,884 --> 04:05:48,094
MATT: All right, as you head back to the district
in which these incursions happened, you are

2892
04:05:48,094 --> 04:05:57,374
immediately recognized and much to their
completely taken aback reaction they bring you in

2893
04:05:57,374 --> 04:06:02,478
until somebody of the higher Bastions goes, "You
fools. This is one of Vox Machina. What's wrong

2894
04:06:02,478 --> 04:06:09,912
"with you?" "Oh I didn't--" And they all point up
at the large titan which is--

2895
04:06:09,912 --> 04:06:12,862
TRAVIS: Yeah, up top, that's where we were.

2896
04:06:12,862 --> 04:06:17,504
MATT: Which currently has been cleared out of any
cursed undead that they know of. It's a process

2897
04:06:17,504 --> 04:06:22,748
that takes a while, but it becomes a monument to
that battle and it becomes converted into a symbol

2898
04:06:22,748 --> 04:06:30,526
of hope for the city. For generations to come in
Vasselheim, that titan will stand there, lording

2899
04:06:30,526 --> 04:06:34,078
over the city, as a reminder of what transpired,
of what could have been lost, and what was saved

2900
04:06:34,078 --> 04:06:37,735
that day in memory of those that were lost. And as
you point up to that and they all realize, they

2901
04:06:37,735 --> 04:06:40,857
slowly remove your shackles.

2902
04:06:40,857 --> 04:06:44,770
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm free to go?

2903
04:06:44,770 --> 04:06:47,533
MATT: "Yes, sir. Thank you, thank you."

2904
04:06:47,533 --> 04:06:59,456
TRAVIS: That's unexpected. Could you point me in
the direction of a library?

2905
04:06:59,456 --> 04:07:07,779
MATT: "Sure, come with me." As you begin to walk
out you watch as a familiar figure steps up to

2906
04:07:07,779 --> 04:07:18,476
this portion of the Bastions' guard post, you see a
familiar merchant who rushes up and goes, "I was

2907
04:07:18,476 --> 04:07:23,778
"being summoned. They found the-- why's he walking
free?"

2908
04:07:23,778 --> 04:07:28,867
TRAVIS: Yes. You. You will come with me.

2909
04:07:28,867 --> 04:07:34,662
MATT: "Gentlemen, this is the man who punched me.
This is the man who ruined my business. I can--"

2910
04:07:34,662 --> 04:07:44,399
TRAVIS: Gentlemen, whose word are you going to
take? The savior of Vasselheim, or his new tutor?

2911
04:07:44,399 --> 04:07:47,810
MATT: "What?"

2912
04:07:47,810 --> 04:07:50,163
(laughter)

2913
04:07:50,163 --> 04:07:56,952
MATT: The guards go, "Cobalt Reserve library
station is down that way to the left. Hard to miss,

2914
04:07:56,952 --> 04:08:02,683
"big blue dome. You two work this out." And they
retract back into the guard post, leaving the two

2915
04:08:02,683 --> 04:08:04,220
of you in the street.

2916
04:08:04,220 --> 04:08:11,306
TRAVIS: Well, unless you have something better to
do, you could contribute to one of the greatest

2917
04:08:11,306 --> 04:08:16,088
people to ever pass through this city and help me
learn to read a little bit more. Would that be a

2918
04:08:16,088 --> 04:08:20,431
problem? I only have 8,000 gold to give you.

2919
04:08:20,431 --> 04:08:22,453
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

2920
04:08:22,453 --> 04:08:24,194
SAM: 8,000 gold.

2921
04:08:24,194 --> 04:08:25,527
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

2922
04:08:25,527 --> 04:08:28,358
(cheering)

2923
04:08:28,358 --> 04:08:31,948
MATT: (laughter) Didn't even need the advantage.
All right.

2924
04:08:31,948 --> 04:08:33,823
SAM: 8,000 gold.

2925
04:08:33,823 --> 04:08:40,961
MATT: "Well, that would certainly go far for
reparations for the damage you've caused to both

2926
04:08:40,961 --> 04:08:43,268
"my business, my person and my psyche."

2927
04:08:43,268 --> 04:08:47,120
(laughter)

2928
04:08:47,120 --> 04:08:54,944
MATT: "But I'm curious to see what this change of
heart is, so sure. But you're going to pay upfront."

2929
04:08:54,944 --> 04:08:56,986
TRAVIS: Yes, 8,000 gold.

2930
04:08:56,986 --> 04:09:00,110
MATT: "Holy shit."

2931
04:09:00,110 --> 04:09:01,979
TRAVIS: I could carry it if you want.

2932
04:09:01,979 --> 04:09:04,952
MATT: "We'll just make a quick stop over by my
shop, please."

2933
04:09:04,952 --> 04:09:06,061
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

2934
04:09:06,061 --> 04:09:10,364
MATT: And he drags it and it leaves this big heavy
groove in the ground as he pulls it along. "Nope,

2935
04:09:10,364 --> 04:09:15,727
"nope, it's good, I got it" (struggling noises) And
leads you to the Cobalt Reserve and for as long as

2936
04:09:15,727 --> 04:09:18,876
you'll have him he'll begin to tutor you.

2937
04:09:18,876 --> 04:09:24,460
TRAVIS: I'd like to learn to read a bit more. I'd
like to split some time in the temple of Kord.

2938
04:09:24,460 --> 04:09:29,945
MATT: Which takes a while to get rebuilt and you
probably help out a bit, too, Earthbreaker Groon,

2939
04:09:29,945 --> 04:09:33,064
who survived, though many of his--

2940
04:09:33,064 --> 04:09:34,759
TRAVIS: Oh, he did survive.

2941
04:09:34,759 --> 04:09:37,582
MATT: He did survive, yeah. He's made of hardier
stuff.

2942
04:09:37,582 --> 04:09:41,997
TRAVIS: I'd also like to bring Pike out every once
in a while and we give challengers a shot in the

2943
04:09:41,997 --> 04:09:50,525
Crucible, but mostly I'm trying to improve my mind
and looking for the next challenge.

2944
04:09:50,525 --> 04:09:52,895
MATT: I like it.

2945
04:09:52,895 --> 04:09:54,564
LIAM: Bring him up to eight intelligence.

2946
04:09:54,564 --> 04:09:55,715
LAURA: Yeah.

2947
04:09:55,715 --> 04:09:57,342
TRAVIS: Seven's a good start.

2948
04:09:57,342 --> 04:09:59,602
(laughter)

2949
04:09:59,602 --> 04:10:01,426
MATT: Perfect. Happy with that?

2950
04:10:01,426 --> 04:10:02,429
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2951
04:10:02,429 --> 04:10:06,375
MATT: Okay, then. Keyleth.

2952
04:10:06,375 --> 04:10:17,948
MARISHA: (sighs) Okay. Naturally, help Pike
rebuild Vasselheim in the most immediate of

2953
04:10:17,948 --> 04:10:34,305
circumstances. Eventually retire to Zephra. Go be
the actual leader of my people. Continue to get in

2954
04:10:34,305 --> 04:10:43,902
any type of frays that these people invite me on
as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my

2955
04:10:43,902 --> 04:10:53,408
promise to protect this realm any time this realm
needs protecting. And I find Kerrick at some

2956
04:10:53,408 --> 04:11:01,590
point. Seek out Kerrick. Make sure he's okay.
Reconnect with him, have coffee, you know.

2957
04:11:01,590 --> 04:11:05,442
MATT: Yeah. He's a quick jaunt from Zephra,
thankfully. Westruun's not that far. That's one of

2958
04:11:05,442 --> 04:11:07,313
the closer large cities outside of Stillben.

2959
04:11:07,313 --> 04:11:09,229
MARISHA: Perfect. We're weekend buddies.

2960
04:11:09,229 --> 04:11:10,748
MATT: (laughs)

2961
04:11:10,748 --> 04:11:23,248
MARISHA: We go to wine country. And then I work on
the propagated sprig from the Sun Tree and

2962
04:11:23,248 --> 04:11:34,129
continue to build it out, hopefully on the ley
lines of the planet, and I take the feather that

2963
04:11:34,129 --> 04:11:48,029
Pike gave me from Vax and I embed it into the
trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from

2964
04:11:48,029 --> 04:11:54,827
the Raven Queen I can find. Care for ravens as
much as I can.

2965
04:11:54,827 --> 04:12:04,301
MATT: There is an uptick of ravens in the space of
Zephra as well. Not many, but more than there would

2966
04:12:04,301 --> 04:12:05,848
be, which is usually zero.

2967
04:12:05,848 --> 04:12:20,085
MARISHA: And from the branch of the Sun Tree
create my own raven tree of the Ashari. Take a

2968
04:12:20,085 --> 04:12:28,815
long, long, long, long, long time before I maybe
date again. Maybe. But eventually, hopefully,

2969
04:12:28,815 --> 04:12:39,978
after a long, long, long, long, long time sunset
into the tree and become a part of this realm.

2970
04:12:39,978 --> 04:12:44,588
MATT: That's a ways off for you, Ms. Archdruid.

2971
04:12:44,588 --> 04:12:46,108
MARISHA: Ways off.

2972
04:12:46,157 --> 04:12:48,069
MATT: But you begin those preparations.

2973
04:12:48,069 --> 04:12:49,612
MARISHA: But that's the plan.

2974
04:12:49,612 --> 04:12:56,976
MATT: Okay. Well you, Keyleth, who many only once
saw the naive druid girl have a level of respect

2975
04:12:56,976 --> 04:13:02,585
now that's carried with that mantle that you hold.
And the council of Tal'Dorei occasionally calls

2976
04:13:02,585 --> 04:13:08,015
upon your wisdom and guidance. The alliance
between the civilised and the natured world of the

2977
04:13:08,015 --> 04:13:13,339
lands irrevocably in Tal'Dorei bound to you at
this point, between you and the earth Ashari who

2978
04:13:13,339 --> 04:13:20,568
reside up in the Cliffkeep. Between occasional
jaunts to Emon and Whitestone, you find renewed

2979
04:13:20,568 --> 04:13:23,324
joy in the protection of the people there.

2980
04:13:23,324 --> 04:13:34,050
One cold Cuersaar the 13th, the tenth month of
the year, the cool summer dusk day closes and you

2981
04:13:34,050 --> 04:13:41,270
emerge from the quarters to find that the winds
come and blow through your hair. You step out to

2982
04:13:41,270 --> 04:13:49,103
the sound of children laughing as a dozen Ashari
kids, elf, dwarf, orc, many bloods and creeds rush

2983
04:13:49,103 --> 04:13:56,091
past as they play. It's a familiar sound. It's a
happy sound. You glance over at this village

2984
04:13:56,091 --> 04:14:04,880
you're protecting and the people that truly look
up to you as their leader, both not just from a

2985
04:14:04,880 --> 04:14:14,794
might source but as a guide. And you look to them
to teach you things every day as well. Looking

2986
04:14:14,794 --> 04:14:20,071
past as the sun begins to set, you see Korrin
standing by the cherry blossom at the edge of the

2987
04:14:20,071 --> 04:14:28,965
cliff near the amphitheatre where you had your
ceremony. In pinks and oranges and purples, the

2988
04:14:28,965 --> 04:14:37,302
sunset takes the sky. As you approach, he still
looks out. He's older, not too much older but older.

2989
04:14:37,302 --> 04:14:50,031
As he notices you approach, he looks over. "In all
my years, not a day passes where awe does not

2990
04:14:50,031 --> 04:15:01,819
"strike me at the beauty of this world." He looks
over towards the sunset. "Don't ever lose the

2991
04:15:01,819 --> 04:15:13,014
"memory of every face whose strength helped you
keep this light from fading. Every single face."

2992
04:15:13,014 --> 04:15:30,009
MARISHA: I don't think it's the faces that keep
this light from fading. I think it is what it is.

2993
04:15:30,009 --> 04:15:48,241
We're lucky to experience it, a few are lucky to
think it's beautiful. You taught me that. I don't

2994
04:15:48,241 --> 04:15:59,101
have to appreciate this. Especially not after what
I've seen. But I do.

2995
04:15:59,101 --> 04:16:01,531
MATT: "You need to."

2996
04:16:01,531 --> 04:16:07,314
MARISHA: Only because of what I've seen.

2997
04:16:07,314 --> 04:16:16,318
MATT: And you see a bit of heartbreak but he nods
his head and reaches out and takes you in, holds

2998
04:16:16,318 --> 04:16:24,481
you there on the cliff side, the winds just being
kept at bay. "I'm proud of you."

2999
04:16:24,481 --> 04:16:46,847
MARISHA: Thank you. It's all I ever wanted. It's
weird, once you reach a life goal and then realize

3000
04:16:46,847 --> 04:17:07,693
you have the rest of your life. I guess I just
find new goals. Sometimes it's hard being a

3001
04:17:07,693 --> 04:17:18,431
prodigy because then you just grow up to be a
regular adult.

3002
04:17:18,431 --> 04:17:31,212
MATT: He pulls you in tighter. "You'll always be
my girl. My little Keyleth."

3003
04:17:31,212 --> 04:17:34,210
MARISHA: Thanks, Dad.

3004
04:17:34,210 --> 04:17:35,708
MATT: "I love you."

3005
04:17:35,708 --> 04:17:37,509
MARISHA: I love you.

3006
04:17:37,509 --> 04:17:46,982
MATT: (sighs) "Anyway, I should get to seeing if
dinner preparations are being made. Looks to be a

3007
04:17:46,982 --> 04:17:53,031
"cold night." He tugs your hand and walks back,
leaves you there on the cliff side looking out. As

3008
04:17:53,031 --> 04:18:02,482
the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon,
leaving you with the purples and blues of the

3009
04:18:02,482 --> 04:18:12,057
night sky as the stars begin to glitter up, you
can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance

3010
04:18:12,057 --> 04:18:19,026
up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree.
There's just one raven.

3011
04:18:19,026 --> 04:18:21,755
MARISHA: Blow a kiss.

3012
04:18:21,755 --> 04:18:30,799
MATT: Flies down, lands on your shoulder. It's a
bigger raven than any you've seen before. You've

3013
04:18:30,799 --> 04:18:33,514
not seen this raven around.

3014
04:18:33,514 --> 04:18:35,688
MARISHA: Little scratch.

3015
04:18:35,688 --> 04:18:39,859
MATT: It leans into it.

3016
04:18:39,859 --> 04:18:46,648
And every day that raven comes to visit.

3017
04:18:46,648 --> 04:18:54,569
And that's where we're going to close the campaign.

3018
04:18:54,569 --> 04:18:58,754
SAM: What a nice story.

3019
04:18:58,754 --> 04:19:00,670
LAURA: Wow.

3020
04:19:00,670 --> 04:19:02,247
TRAVIS: Let's do it again.

3021
04:19:02,247 --> 04:19:04,334
(laughter)

3022
04:19:04,334 --> 04:19:05,843
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

3023
04:19:05,843 --> 04:19:17,200
MATT: Oh, wow. When this chapter closes, a whole
new one, a whole new one opens very soon. (sighs)

3024
04:19:17,200 --> 04:19:22,675
We'll be back in the new year with a new story to
tell and in the meantime we'll be playing games

3025
04:19:22,675 --> 04:19:29,298
here and mixing it up. Being silly. A few other
faces are going to take up the storytelling mantle

3026
04:19:29,298 --> 04:19:33,056
here. Me and Marisha have a wedding in a little
over a week.

3027
04:19:33,056 --> 04:19:40,413
MARISHA: Oh god. I had to get past this emotional
chapter so I could get through the next one.

3028
04:19:40,413 --> 04:19:42,540
(laughter)

3029
04:19:42,540 --> 04:19:49,292
MATT: But here we are at the end of this
near-five-year journey for us and near-three-year

3030
04:19:49,292 --> 04:19:55,237
journey with all of you and I just want to
appreciate having, honestly, some of the best

3031
04:19:55,237 --> 04:20:00,516
friends and players I could ever hope for to come
along on this journey, to trust me enough to build

3032
04:20:00,516 --> 04:20:04,364
this with you and to give back so much more than I
could have ever hoped.

3033
04:20:04,364 --> 04:20:06,166
LIAM: Thank you, Matt.

3034
04:20:06,166 --> 04:20:07,667
LAURA: Thank you.

3035
04:20:07,667 --> 04:20:09,530
MARISHA: Best DM ever.

3036
04:20:09,530 --> 04:20:14,025
MATT: You guys make it all easy and worthwhile.

3037
04:20:14,025 --> 04:20:15,746
LAURA: Oh fuck.

3038
04:20:15,746 --> 04:20:17,443
MATT: Love you guys.

3039
04:20:17,443 --> 04:20:21,773
LAURA: Shit. Yay!

3040
04:20:21,773 --> 04:20:27,539
MATT: And love you guys, each and every one of you
out there who've come with us on this journey;

3041
04:20:27,539 --> 04:20:32,490
new, old, for just a bit, or the entire length,
some of you multiple times. Thank you for joining

3042
04:20:32,490 --> 04:20:49,485
in on whatever this weird little magical, curious
experience has, and will continue to be. Promise

3043
04:20:49,485 --> 04:20:52,110
me you'll be good.

3044
04:20:52,110 --> 04:20:53,296
MARISHA: We'll be back.

3045
04:20:53,296 --> 04:20:54,603
LAURA: Yeah, we'll be back.

3046
04:20:54,603 --> 04:20:58,393
LIAM: We might look a little different, but we're
still going to be here.

3047
04:20:58,393 --> 04:20:59,816
MATT: Yep!

3048
04:20:59,816 --> 04:21:03,115
LAURA: That was a really pretty sendoff, Matt.
Thank you.

3049
04:21:03,115 --> 04:21:04,698
MARISHA: That was beautiful.

3050
04:21:04,698 --> 04:21:08,016
SAM: Thanks, Matt. That was really nice.

3051
04:21:08,016 --> 04:21:11,444
MATT: Love you, guys.

3052
04:21:11,444 --> 04:21:13,447
LAURA: Love you, Matthew.

3053
04:21:13,447 --> 04:21:25,581
MATT: Love you, guys. Have a wonderful night. Rest
well. And is it Thursday yet?
