00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:02.253  
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:05.923  
of Critical Role or I guess whenever this night came out,

3
00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:07.340  
this night's episode of Critical Role.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.008  
(laughter)

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:11.512  
Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

6
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.653  
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons.

7
00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:15.570  
(cheering)

8
00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:19.368  
Specifically tonight, we're doing one of our Kickstarter

9
00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:22.326  
one-shots that was unlocked that was a continuation

10
00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:24.285  
of our Search for Grog one-shot.

11
00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.621  
We got to the point of the adventure in which

12
00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:29.308  
Grog was saved.

13
00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:30.666
TRAVIS: Found me!

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.331  
MATT: The spirit was returned to the body,

15
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.937  
but they still are amongst the chaos of Pandemonium.

16
00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.017  
So as part of this unlock within the stretch goals

17
00:00:41.017 --> 00:00:43.393  
of the Kickstarter campaign, we now get to do

18
00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:44.846  
the other half of this storyline

19
00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:47.679  
that we didn't expect to do, which is awesome.

20
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.185  
For tonight, if you haven't noticed,

21
00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:50.113  
we're all dressed very comfy.

22
00:00:50.113 --> 00:00:52.049  
We have decided, as of recent conversations,

23
00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.145  
to go ahead to have a classic night

24
00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:56.001  
where we all dress up like we used to have

25
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.817  
our Sunday morning brunch games and be in pajamas

26
00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:02.225  
and have mimosas and snacks.

27
00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:03.575  
MARISHA: Cheers to Sunday brunch.

28
00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.183  
MATT: Cheers, indeed.

29
00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:07.299  
SAM: This may come out on a Sunday. We don't know.

30
00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.482
MATT: Could be, could be. There you go.

31
00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:09.365
LAURA and MATT: Love you guys.

32
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.156  
TRAVIS: Not wearing anything under this table.

33
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.414
LAURA, LIAM, and MATT: Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes.

34
00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.633  
MATT: Take a nice battle cam view of our fantastic

35
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.689  
spread of snacks here that Ashley and Laura

36
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.466  
and other folks all put together for this.

37
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.818  
SAM: Healthy, too.
(laughter)

38
00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.131  
LIAM: Give me that cheese.

39
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:28.926  
ASHLEY: Get in it. It's good.

40
00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:30.291  
MATT: But yes, so prepare

41
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.888  
yourself for some light snacking as we go through

42
00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:36.096  
because this is also our call back to

43
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.377
the olden days at our newer table.

44
00:01:39.377 --> 00:01:40.912  
LAURA: Chomp chomp chomp chomp.

45
00:01:40.912 --> 00:01:43.632  
MATT: That being the case, let's go ahead

46
00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:46.839  
and jump into today-- tonight's episode,

47
00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:50.933  
whenever this is happening-- this episode of Critical Role.

48
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.625  
OFF-SCREEN: (sings Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song")

49
00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.290  
OFF-CAMERA: We're just going to count you back in.

50
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.107  
MATT: You got it.

51
00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:07.177  
OFF-CAMERA: Five, four, three, two--

52
00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:08.510
LIAM: Dildo Dragon.
TRAVIS: (shushing)

53
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.218  
MATT: And welcome back.

54
00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:15.309  
Last we left off,

55
00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.850
the party known as Vox Machina,

56
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.327  
upon saving Exandria by and large from the incursion

57
00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:24.160  
of Vecna, Thar Amphala,

58
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.126  
and the Shadowfell-based minions of his

59
00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:29.527  
that had brought him to ascend as a god,

60
00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:33.009  
you sealed him away and, however, in the process,

61
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.850  
closed the chapter on your friend, Vax'ildan.

62
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.711  
Upon returning home to Whitestone, Grog pulled a card

63
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.727  
from the Deck of Many Things, pulled the worst card

64
00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:45.044  
from the deck, and had his soul jettisoned off

65
00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:46.211  
into a random plane.

66
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:47.285
TRAVIS: That's a matter of opinion.

67
00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:49.371  
MATT: Yeah, his body left lifeless.

68
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:52.785  
The last game you had discovered his soulless body,

69
00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:57.782  
took it to Vasselheim and asked the council there

70
00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:59.574  
for some help in trying to ascertain

71
00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:02.518  
the location of his spirit, wherever it may be.

72
00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:05.577  
Discovering that it was in the Plane of Pandemonium,

73
00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:07.926  
the windswept realm of madness,

74
00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:10.886  
you gathered yourself a couple of allies

75
00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.958  
in Sir Bertrand Bell, a seasoned adventurer

76
00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.842  
who had volunteered his services as a guide

77
00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.811  
who had been to Pandemonium before supposedly,

78
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.540  
but had never been to Pandemonium and Lieve'tel--

79
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.989  
LIAM: A real nice lady.
MATT: A really nice lady

80
00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.708  
of the Raven Queen, who as part of paying penance

81
00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:32.777  
for the loss of Vax'ildan had offered herself

82
00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:36.145  
to volunteer to aid them on this mission.

83
00:03:36.145 --> 00:03:38.624  
You guys rounded up the last bit of things

84
00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:41.138  
you needed, said goodbye to a few friends about the city

85
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:44.626  
and then made your journey to Pandemonium.

86
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:46.450  
Immediately blasted by the incredible winds

87
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.102  
and the lightless expanse that was around you

88
00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:52.721  
in the interior, you shouted commands as you made your way

89
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.738  
across the dangerous landscape,

90
00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:58.857  
ran into a strange individual who seemed to be of Gith

91
00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:02.110  
lineage who couldn't remember their name and asked some

92
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.362  
curious questions before vanishing

93
00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:06.323  
into the dust storm around you.

94
00:04:06.323 --> 00:04:08.978  
You continued on forward after having visions

95
00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:12.034  
of where this stone, this ruby-like gem

96
00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:14.336  
that contained Grog's soul, was embedded

97
00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:15.914  
at the top of this spire that existed

98
00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:17.221  
somewhere on this plane.

99
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:20.380  
You made your way to Howler's Crag, the base of this

100
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.698  
mountain tower. You battled howlers that had stalked

101
00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.288  
and hunted you on your way there.

102
00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:27.562  
You made your way through the tunnels and caves

103
00:04:27.562 --> 00:04:31.305  
that wound up the interior of this giant structure.

104
00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.266  
A bunch of bugbears came out of nowhere

105
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:36.978  
and tore off Percy's arm. It's crazy.

106
00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:38.645  
SAM: It was crazy.
LAURA: It was your other one, darling.

107
00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.588  
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

108
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:42.226  
MATT: Then regenerated. There's now a third Percy arm

109
00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:44.559  
that's just disembodied and flapping around.

110
00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.009  
Awkward. Very D&D.

111
00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:51.596  
You then also stealthily bypassed

112
00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:56.512
a distracted demon entity known as a balor

113
00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:58.345
that seemed to be in the process of

114
00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.910
painting bloody pictures on a wall.

115
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.700  
You carefully pushed by the tight space,

116
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.267  
many of you burned heavily, escaping the other side

117
00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:09.665  
and climbing to the top of the tower where, awaiting you,

118
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:12.884  
guarding this gem as part of the enchantment

119
00:05:12.884 --> 00:05:15.060  
or just the general proximity of Pandemonium

120
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.387  
or a combination of the two, a corrupted empyrean,

121
00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:22.994  
an entity of celestial origin, a half-child of the gods,

122
00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:26.548  
screaming mad into the winds above, bound somehow

123
00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:30.756  
to this tower, its history lost and its mind

124
00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:34.348  
every bit as scattered. You climbed the outside

125
00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:36.339  
of this tower, did battle with it.

126
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.615  
It smashed and angrily dashed each of you

127
00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:43.377  
nearly from the tower multiple times, sending Bertrand Bell,

128
00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:48.056  
clinging to life. Did actually smash and kill Lieve'tel,

129
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.837  
who now lies lifeless.

130
00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:53.730  
In the midst of this intense throw down,

131
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.992  
Trinket, gritting his bare teeth

132
00:05:56.992 --> 00:05:59.090  
with the unconscious, soulless body of Grog

133
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.666  
affixed to his back by chains,

134
00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:04.575  
climbed the edge of the mountain, rushed toward the stone

135
00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:06.929  
and upon meeting Grog's body to the stone,

136
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.826  
Grog was brought back to consciousness,

137
00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:12.146  
the spirit instilling him with that angry barbarian

138
00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:16.924  
power from within and through some absurd fucking luck

139
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:21.810  
rolled two natural 20s in a row and dealt the final blow

140
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.378  
to the creature, axe sinking into its corrupted

141
00:06:25.378 --> 00:06:27.074  
celestial body, tearing it asunder

142
00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:29.566  
and that was where we ended.

143
00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:32.323
SAM: Because of parking restrictions.

144
00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:35.175
MATT: Because of parking restrictions. That is correct.

145
00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:37.292  
(laughter)

146
00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:38.662  
TRAVIS: We don't want to get locked in. We got to go.

147
00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:39.495  
MATT: Yep!

148
00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:41.744
LIAM: The real world creeps in sometimes.
MARISHA: Yeah.

149
00:06:41.744 --> 00:06:43.722  
MATT: Sometimes. So.

150
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.770  
We begin.

151
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.744
You, Vox Machina and allies,

152
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:52.960
dead and alive.

153
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.216  
LIAM: Well, you know, take a penny, leave a penny.

154
00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:57.154  
MATT: Yeah there. (laughs)

155
00:06:57.154 --> 00:07:00.242  
You are stranded within the Plane of Pandemonium,

156
00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:03.010  
your premium spell components apparently stolen,

157
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.466  
leaving you adrift in a lightless realm of madness.

158
00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:09.733  
The ruined body of the massive corrupt celestial being

159
00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:13.152  
lies crumbling atop the spire of Howler's Crag,

160
00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:16.482  
the wind whipping around the remnants of the battlefield.

161
00:07:16.482 --> 00:07:19.042  
Dust and rocks sting your flesh as you stand

162
00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:22.914  
looking out into the darkness around you here atop the peak.

163
00:07:22.914 --> 00:07:26.223  
Grog stands enlarged and breathing heavily,

164
00:07:26.223 --> 00:07:27.950  
his eyes filled with the rage and joy,

165
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.942  
clutching his axe atop the body of the empyrean,

166
00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:34.050  
its blackened flesh slowly burning away into ash.

167
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.656  
The rest of you stand around the broken rock, battered

168
00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:41.656  
lifeless body of Lieve'tel also broken among the ruin.

169
00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:45.666  
Vox Machina, what would you like to do?

170
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:49.408  
ASHLEY: Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

171
00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:52.466  
TRAVIS: (excited breathing) Did you see that shit?!

172
00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:54.226  
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was amazing!

173
00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:57.442  
TRAVIS: By the way quick point, safety tip,

174
00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:00.642  
I think the Deck of Many Things

175
00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:02.402
may be dangerous.

176
00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:05.060  
SAM: No.
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Really?

177
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.383  
LAURA: Do you know where you are right now?

178
00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:07.950  
Do you know where <i>we</i> are right now?

179
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.658  
TRAVIS: In a castle.

180
00:08:09.658 --> 00:08:12.578
LAURA: No. We're literally not anywhere near it.

181
00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:15.010  
We're on top. It's very windy.

182
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.735  
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, yeah, terrible weather we're having.

183
00:08:18.735 --> 00:08:21.540  
LAURA: (sighs)
SAM: (laughs)

184
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.810  
TALIESIN: Perhaps some shelter and perhaps a moment

185
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.889  
to take care of this problem?

186
00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:27.375  
MATT: Could you roll a death saving throw for me?

187
00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:29.650  
TRAVIS: Yeah for the--
SAM: Death saving throw?

188
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.766  
MATT: For Bertrand Bell, who's still unconscious.

189
00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:31.599
SAM: Is he dead?

190
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:32.982  
LIAM: He's making death saves.

191
00:08:32.982 --> 00:08:34.882
LAURA: And she's dead dead.

192
00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.098  
TRAVIS: Success.
LIAM: Dead dead.

193
00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:39.378  
MARISHA: I drop my form, my pit fiend form.

194
00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.889  
That's what I was, right? What was I?

195
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.997  
MATT: You were a goristro.
MARISHA: A goristro.

196
00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.217
Foom!

197
00:08:46.217 --> 00:08:47.908  
LAURA: Oh, hi.

198
00:08:47.908 --> 00:08:49.522  
MARISHA: That went great!
SAM: We have Grog

199
00:08:49.522 --> 00:08:51.986  
back, but our two new friends are fallen

200
00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:54.111  
and one seems to be--

201
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.786
her head is just crushed beyond repair.

202
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.330  
MATT: Roll again.
TRAVIS: Oh, second death

203
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.824  
saving throw. That's a one.

204
00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:03.982  
MATT: That's two failures.

205
00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:05.205
LIAM: Every six seconds.

206
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:07.330  
SAM: Triage, triage to someone.

207
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.597  
Pikey! Pike! Heal him!

208
00:09:09.597 --> 00:09:11.330  
MATT: Those are you first two fails?

209
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.479  
TRAVIS: Two fails, one success.
MATT: All right.

210
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.354  
TRAVIS: What do you mean new friends? Who are these fuckers?

211
00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:18.725  
MARISHA: I Healing Word Bertrand.

212
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.922  
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for it.

213
00:09:19.922 --> 00:09:22.302  
LAURA: Scanlan, can you make the mansion?

214
00:09:22.302 --> 00:09:24.139  
SAM: Sure, but I hardly think that will--

215
00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:25.697  
MARISHA: Six.

216
00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:26.530  
TRAVIS: Six points?

217
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.642  
MARISHA: No wait, six plus I get to add something, right?

218
00:09:28.642 --> 00:09:30.175  
MATT: Add your wisdom modifier.

219
00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:33.592  
MARISHA: Oh, okay, 14.

220
00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:37.026  
TRAVIS: 14, may I take--
MARISHA: No, 12, 12, 12.

221
00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:38.498  
TRAVIS: May I take 12 points of healing?

222
00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:40.424  
MATT: You can take 12 points of healing for Bertrand.

223
00:09:40.424 --> 00:09:43.768  
You are now conscious again.

224
00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:46.126  
SAM: What do you mean?
LIAM: I want my Player's Handbook!

225
00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:47.216  
SAM: Oh sure.
LIAM: Give it to me!

226
00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.279  
SAM: But you're dead.
LIAM: But I am a D&D player.

227
00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:51.400  
(laughter)

228
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.999
TALIESIN: I've heard Scrappy Doo in every D&D game.

229
00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:58.867  
SAM: Oh Mr. Bell! Mr. Bell is alive and awake.

230
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:00.191  
TRAVIS: Oh, did we kill it?

231
00:10:00.191 --> 00:10:02.458  
We killed it, right?
LAURA: <i>We</i> killed it.

232
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:05.817  
ASHLEY: We did. It's dead.
TRAVIS: I hurt so much.

233
00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.058  
I hurt so much.

234
00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.650  
SAM: You were very brave. You actually were very brave.

235
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.271  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) Thank you.

236
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:13.634  
Oh my god, who is that?

237
00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:14.835  
(as Grog) Who is that small fighter?

238
00:10:14.835 --> 00:10:17.730  
(as Bertrand) You are so handsome and huge.

239
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.298  
(as Grog) My god, you are so old. Look at his hair.

240
00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:23.948  
Who is this fucking twerp?

241
00:10:23.948 --> 00:10:25.561  
SAM: I think he can answer for himself.

242
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.136  
(laughter)

243
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:32.515  
(as Bertrand) It is a pleasure, a pleasure to meet you.

244
00:10:32.515 --> 00:10:36.115  
You are the one that we were clearly coming to rescue.

245
00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:38.051  
He's enormous.
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's big.

246
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:42.259  
TRAVIS: He's really large. Oh hmm, is the danger passed?

247
00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.386  
TALIESIN: Well!
LAURA: Mostly.

248
00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.410  
TRAVIS: Somewhat.
SAM: We're still in a

249
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.627  
realm of constant evil and surrounded by demons.

250
00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:50.195  
ASHLEY: Still in Pandemonium, yes.

251
00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:51.795  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) What? Where? What do you mean, "demons?"

252
00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.253  
What did you say? Andemonium?

253
00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.707
TALIESIN: This is what you did to us.

254
00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:56.355  
LAURA: This is what you did to us.

255
00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.129  
TRAVIS: What do you mean, "did to us?"

256
00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:01.699  
I pulled the card. I wake up and you guys took me somewhere

257
00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:03.716  
while I was asleep.
ASHLEY: You came here,

258
00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:05.955  
you fell asleep, you wouldn't wake up,

259
00:11:05.955 --> 00:11:08.067  
and then we had to come here and we had to get you.

260
00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.355  
LAURA: After you promised not to draw any cards.

261
00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:12.767  
TRAVIS: Hold on just a second. Now Pike,

262
00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:14.482  
clearly I'm a sleepwalker,

263
00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:18.060  
but I don't think I could walk here in my sleep.

264
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.402  
MARISHA: Well, technically your soul

265
00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:25.396  
got like ripped from your body and attached here.

266
00:11:25.396 --> 00:11:26.562  
TRAVIS: How?

267
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:29.772  
LAURA: Trinket had to carry your lifeless form all the way.

268
00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:33.104  
MATT: (grunts) Trinket comes up and head butts you.

269
00:11:33.104 --> 00:11:35.730  
TRAVIS: Hi buddy.
MATT: (growls)

270
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.571  
TRAVIS: Is it my birthday? Is this like a surprise party?

271
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.321  
MARISHA: No, I was actually hoping that Pandemonium

272
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:45.052  
would be much cuter because I initially thought

273
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:48.802  
pandas because Panda-monium,

274
00:11:48.802 --> 00:11:50.077
but it's, um.

275
00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:51.093  
TALIESIN: I'm irritated that I can see

276
00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:52.296
where you're going with that.
TRAVIS: You all look a little

277
00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.429
worse for the wear.

278
00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:58.173  
SAM: I think-- guys, I think that Grog is mentally incapable

279
00:11:58.173 --> 00:12:00.085  
of understanding what just happened.

280
00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:00.918  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) I was wondering

281
00:12:00.918 --> 00:12:02.482
if that's normal for him.

282
00:12:02.482 --> 00:12:03.883  
He seems like a real idiot.

283
00:12:03.883 --> 00:12:07.888  
SAM: Maybe it's better if we just don't try.

284
00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:09.146  
Let's just move on.
TALIESIN: We'll attempt it

285
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.361
once we're somewhere where we have props.

286
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:12.147  
SAM: That's right.
MATT: Perception check, Percival.

287
00:12:12.147 --> 00:12:14.472  
TALIESIN: Yes!

288
00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:17.747
Oh, that's so sad to look at after--
SAM: Perhaps we could

289
00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:19.738
illustrate it for him with shadow puppets.

290
00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:20.571  
TALIESIN: 13.

291
00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:22.120
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I would like that very much.

292
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.623  
MATT: Within the short radius of light that you do have,

293
00:12:25.623 --> 00:12:28.861  
you just see sand and wind. You are standing still

294
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:33.261  
upon the peak of Howler's Crag, which--

295
00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:37.128  
TALIESIN: I'm feeling a bit exposed, to be honest.

296
00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:39.536
SAM: All right.
TALIESIN: Can we get--

297
00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:41.781  
SAM: Should I put up the mansion

298
00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:43.828  
or should we try to get out of here?

299
00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:45.285  
LAURA: We have to drag this dead form

300
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:46.468  
all the way?
ASHLEY: I'll get her.

301
00:12:46.468 --> 00:12:48.229  
I'm going to over and try to pick her up.

302
00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:50.823  
MARISHA: Careful, her head might collapse if you move it.

303
00:12:50.823 --> 00:12:52.401  
SAM: Yeah, it's barely together.
MARISHA: Yeah.

304
00:12:52.401 --> 00:12:54.992  
MARISHA: Maybe you should like tape it, wrap it.

305
00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:56.092
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can try to--

306
00:12:56.092 --> 00:12:57.892  
TRAVIS: What's her head look like?

307
00:12:57.892 --> 00:13:00.987  
TALIESIN: Put her in the Bag of Colding, for god's sakes.

308
00:13:00.987 --> 00:13:03.050  
SAM: At least her head.

309
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.408  
LIAM: I like that, without dice rolls,

310
00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.366
a bugbear's ripped off

311
00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:09.354  
Percy's arm and we grew a little tiny sea anemone hand.

312
00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:11.844  
TALIESIN: That was a lot of spells.

313
00:13:11.844 --> 00:13:13.652  
LAURA: And that was not his head.

314
00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:14.993
SAM: All right, I will cast

315
00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:18.179  
the Magnificent Mansion so that we can get some peace.

316
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:19.155  
TALIESIN: Thank you.

317
00:13:19.155 --> 00:13:20.446  
SAM: ♪ Waaaa! ♪

318
00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:22.954
MATT: The glowing purple doorway opens up.

319
00:13:22.954 --> 00:13:25.123
You can see it flickering a bit

320
00:13:25.123 --> 00:13:30.067  
just from the brief moment of distant interference

321
00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:33.104  
from having to reach across the planes to open this doorway.

322
00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.447  
But it opens up plainly without issue.

323
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:35.388  
SAM: All right, everyone get in.

324
00:13:35.388 --> 00:13:37.404
LAURA: I'll hold her head together.

325
00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:38.237  
TALIESIN: Let's get all of her in here,

326
00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:39.637
see if we can do something about this.

327
00:13:39.637 --> 00:13:41.757  
TRAVIS: Did you guys do that to her?

328
00:13:41.757 --> 00:13:43.429  
LAURA: No, you did this to her, Grog.

329
00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:45.112  
ASHLEY: You did it.
TALIESIN: You were responsible for this.

330
00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:48.461  
TRAVIS: I feel like I'm missing something. Let's go inside.

331
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:49.669  
MATT: All right.

332
00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:51.035  
LAURA: I want to keep holding her head,

333
00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:52.001
but I also really want

334
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:54.580  
to get some cheese off that plate

335
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.935  
so I'm just going to set it down.

336
00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.029  
ASHLEY: I got her.
LAURA: Okay.

337
00:13:57.029 --> 00:14:01.962  
ASHLEY: I'm going to try casting Revivify.

338
00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:03.126  
I don't know if it's going to work.

339
00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:04.393  
SAM: Has it been more than a minute?

340
00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:06.392  
MATT: It's been far more than a minute.

341
00:14:06.392 --> 00:14:08.040  
ASHLEY: Oh shit, that's a minute, isn't it?

342
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.786  
MATT: And you do not have any components on you.

343
00:14:11.786 --> 00:14:13.035  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

344
00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:15.403  
SAM: Because we were robbed.
LAURA: What do we do?

345
00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:19.243
ASHLEY: I was just trying to see if maybe you forgot.

346
00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:21.604  
TRAVIS: We were robbed?

347
00:14:21.604 --> 00:14:24.170  
SAM: We were also robbed, Grog.
MATT: Respect.

348
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.332  
SAM: This fellow named Bob--

349
00:14:27.332 --> 00:14:30.315
at least that's what we think his name was.

350
00:14:30.315 --> 00:14:33.539  
He met us, he talked to us for a while,

351
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.198  
and then when we looked down at our pockets,

352
00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:39.409  
all of our money and possessions were gone for most of us.

353
00:14:39.409 --> 00:14:43.433  
TRAVIS: I'm asleep for one day and you take me to some

354
00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:47.383  
random ass place and get robbed. What has become of you--

355
00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:51.431  
SAM: I don't even know, Grog. Maybe you should check your

356
00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:54.120  
body. He could have robbed things off of your body.

357
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.896  
TRAVIS: Can I check my person and my Bag of Holding

358
00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:01.229  
and all my bits. Like, are my balls there?

359
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.860  
(laughter)

360
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.972  
SAM: We'll edit out to shorten it.

361
00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:10.367  
MATT: Thank you. Don't. It's part of the genuine experience.

362
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.273
TRAVIS: Yeah. What's the rush?

363
00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:14.964  
MATT: Your Bag of Holding is missing.

364
00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:16.311  
(gasps)

365
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.620  
SAM: You were robbed.
ASHLEY: There was so much

366
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.519  
in that bag.
LAURA: The whole bag?!

367
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.546  
TRAVIS: It's like our identities,

368
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:25.208  
all these years in one bag.

369
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:27.102  
LAURA: I'm a very perceptive person.

370
00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:29.918  
I can't believe he robbed all of us and I didn't notice.

371
00:15:29.918 --> 00:15:31.218  
MARISHA: There was some

372
00:15:31.218 --> 00:15:34.190
little bits of Dork the Ox in that bag.

373
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.550  
TRAVIS: No, those are gone by now.

374
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.942  
MARISHA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

375
00:15:36.942 --> 00:15:38.960  
But there was lots of fancy robes and expensive wines.

376
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.166  
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Still smells like him.

377
00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:43.454  
TRAVIS: Flatware and really--
LAURA: Dried poo.

378
00:15:43.454 --> 00:15:45.215  
Some dried poo.
SAM: Grog, this is

379
00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:49.533  
actually a good thing because you know what this means?

380
00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.449  
You know what this gives us an opportunity to do?

381
00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:52.282  
TRAVIS: Not really.

382
00:15:52.282 --> 00:15:53.866  
SAM: Revenge.
TRAVIS: (gasps)

383
00:15:53.866 --> 00:15:56.915  
SAM: We're going to find this Bob, get back our belongings,

384
00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:01.198  
and make him pay for desecrating your sort of dead body

385
00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:03.252  
and stealing from us.

386
00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:05.502  
We are Vox fucking Machina.

387
00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:08.265  
He can't steal from us.

388
00:16:08.265 --> 00:16:10.908  
We're the fucking police and army--

389
00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:13.352  
MARISHA: I mean, technically, he did steal from us.

390
00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:16.354  
TRAVIS: I was almost outraged. I was like this close.

391
00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:18.937  
SAM: I know. It's been a long day.

392
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.129  
TRAVIS: Deliver me next time, will you?

393
00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:22.154  
Don't just tease a man.
SAM: I'll try.

394
00:16:22.154 --> 00:16:23.728  
TRAVIS: Okay.

395
00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:26.145  
TALIESIN: Let's perhaps do something.

396
00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:29.889  
MARISHA: How do we track him down?

397
00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:31.974  
We should sleep and then track him down.

398
00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:34.641  
TRAVIS: Yeah we can track, but we've tracked harder people.

399
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:37.238  
What did this person look like?

400
00:16:37.238 --> 00:16:38.436  
SAM: I don't really remember.

401
00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:40.102  
MARISHA: He was a gith.
TRAVIS: He was what?

402
00:16:40.102 --> 00:16:43.638  
LAURA: Oh, you know, I remember. You remember that skull

403
00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:45.251  
that you and Percy fought over?

404
00:16:45.251 --> 00:16:47.379  
TRAVIS: I don't know if it's fought, more like I--

405
00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:48.438  
TALIESIN: We don't talk about that skull.

406
00:16:48.438 --> 00:16:50.262  
We're hoping it's just going to vanish from his memory.

407
00:16:50.262 --> 00:16:53.094  
LAURA: I feel like he was one of those things.

408
00:16:53.094 --> 00:16:54.262  
TRAVIS: A skull?

409
00:16:54.262 --> 00:16:56.054  
TALIESIN: We're all technically a skull, dear.

410
00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.814  
LAURA: No, no, like--
SAM: He had skin and hair.

411
00:16:57.814 --> 00:17:00.852  
TRAVIS: That sounds like nobody you want to mess with.

412
00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:03.508  
LAURA: It was this ancient weird-looking skull, remember?

413
00:17:03.508 --> 00:17:06.328  
Never mind.
TALIESIN: I'll also add.

414
00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:09.286  
This person has all of our things. Find Objects,

415
00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:11.814  
some basic scrying should be able to-- we know everything.

416
00:17:11.814 --> 00:17:14.685  
LAURA: I have Locate Object. I can do that.

417
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:19.685  
SAM: First, should we deal with the Lieve'tel woman?

418
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.373  
TALIESIN: Yes.
ASHLEY: What about Spare the Dying?

419
00:17:22.373 --> 00:17:23.483  
SAM: What's that do?

420
00:17:23.483 --> 00:17:25.189  
ASHLEY: I don't think I need any components for that.

421
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:26.189  
SAM: What does that do?

422
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:27.554  
MATT: That's revolting.

423
00:17:27.554 --> 00:17:30.055
LAURA: Ew, gross! Don't waste the meat like that!

424
00:17:30.055 --> 00:17:31.147  
SAM: That's part of her brain.

425
00:17:31.147 --> 00:17:33.113
LAURA: You have to eat it!
LIAM: Of course I'm going to eat it.

426
00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:35.413  
LAURA: Gross.
LIAM: Put my face back on!

427
00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:38.548
LAURA: Liam O'Brien, don't be nasty.

428
00:17:38.548 --> 00:17:40.227
TRAVIS: There's going to be a break out tomorrow.

429
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.797
Just up here in this.

430
00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:44.884
LAURA: Yeah. [inaudbile] UCB!

431
00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:47.634  
TRAVIS: What happened to that part of your forehead?

432
00:17:49.078 --> 00:17:51.017  
SAM: Pike, what does that do, what does that do?

433
00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:53.087  
ASHLEY: Spare the Dying, you just touch someone

434
00:17:53.087 --> 00:17:54.367  
and it instantly brings them back.

435
00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:55.200  
But I don't know

436
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.033  
if he's still alive.
LAURA: I feel like it's only

437
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:56.866  
if somebody's unconscious.

438
00:17:56.866 --> 00:17:58.824  
ASHLEY: It's only unconscious.

439
00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:01.612  
You know even though I'm level 20, I really can't remember

440
00:18:01.612 --> 00:18:04.877  
somehow anything.
TALIESIN: Just because recently

441
00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:07.582  
I've been reading up on how clerics function.

442
00:18:07.582 --> 00:18:10.755  
I've been reading a fascinating book about the art of--

443
00:18:10.755 --> 00:18:14.790  
SAM: Clericcing?
TALIESIN: Clerical work.

444
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.857  
TRAVIS: Can I go over and loot?
TALIESIN: I believe that there's

445
00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:19.037  
in fact a 5th-level spell, but unfortunately

446
00:18:19.037 --> 00:18:21.373  
we would need some components for it to function.

447
00:18:21.373 --> 00:18:22.253  
It's very difficult to bring

448
00:18:22.253 --> 00:18:23.676  
somebody back from the dead without components.

449
00:18:23.676 --> 00:18:25.629  
ASHLEY: Yes, we need components.
LAURA: Did he take all

450
00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:27.297  
of our components, or just the fancy ones?

451
00:18:27.297 --> 00:18:28.735  
MATT: All the fancy ones.

452
00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:30.518
TALIESIN: Oh, so we might have--
LAURA: Unfancy ones.

453
00:18:30.518 --> 00:18:32.717  
MATT: You have the basic components, but anything that has

454
00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:35.629  
a monetary cost in the name--
TALIESIN: A monetary cost in the name.

455
00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:36.955  
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: Bugger.

456
00:18:36.955 --> 00:18:39.403  
TRAVIS: Can I go over and look at the body of Lieve'tel?

457
00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:42.097  
What do I see?
MATT: Okay.

458
00:18:42.097 --> 00:18:44.219  
If you'd like to describe what Grog sees

459
00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:46.935  
when Grog walks over to look upon the body of Lieve'tel.

460
00:18:46.935 --> 00:18:48.451  
LIAM: I don't know; she's dead.

461
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.840  
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I've never seen her before.

462
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.130  
LIAM: I don't remember what happened to her before.

463
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.976  
Oh, what she looks like.
MATT: Yes.

464
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:57.081  
LIAM: Well, she's a striking, beautiful, dark-haired woman.

465
00:18:57.081 --> 00:18:59.322  
TALIESIN: She strikes everyone.

466
00:18:59.322 --> 00:19:02.779  
LIAM: She's got a plume of black feathers and a robe,

467
00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:07.779  
a black robe and silver stars and her head is cleft.

468
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.323  
TRAVIS: Cleft?

469
00:19:09.323 --> 00:19:10.603
LIAM: Split.

470
00:19:10.603 --> 00:19:11.530
TRAVIS: Oh, oh.

471
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.115  
ASHLEY: It's split open.

472
00:19:13.115 --> 00:19:14.776  
LIAM: One of the eyes is hanging from a little string.

473
00:19:14.776 --> 00:19:16.731  
TRAVIS: Are those her noodles coming out of there?

474
00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:18.931
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Well, I hope so.

475
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:23.021  
SAM: What components do you need, Pikey Poo?

476
00:19:23.021 --> 00:19:24.229  
ASHLEY: Diamonds.

477
00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.970  
SAM: How many and how much of value?

478
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.875  
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: 500.

479
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.370  
TALIESIN: If I recall.
ASHLEY: Yes, I think

480
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.136  
that's absolutely correct.

481
00:19:33.136 --> 00:19:34.619  
SAM: I might be able to get that for you.

482
00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:37.259  
TALIESIN: We would also have to put her head back together,

483
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:40.187  
if I recall, at least try and put it back together.

484
00:19:40.187 --> 00:19:42.978  
LAURA: Well, it's pretty close together.

485
00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:45.852
She might come back a little different.

486
00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.848  
TALIESIN: Unless there's a spell I don't know about.

487
00:19:47.848 --> 00:19:50.250  
MATT: Well, no, as long as you have all the pieces

488
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.651  
and hold them together, it should be okay.

489
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.604  
SAM: You know what? You know what we should do?

490
00:19:54.604 --> 00:19:57.465  
We should all go outside and just look on the floor

491
00:19:57.465 --> 00:19:59.355  
to make sure none of the pieces fell out.

492
00:19:59.355 --> 00:20:01.748  
TALIESIN: I swear, by the way, if you bust out an jigsaw

493
00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:02.798  
puzzle right now I'm going to be

494
00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:05.370
the happiest man in the world.

495
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.341  
With just Lieve's face.

496
00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:09.008  
LAURA: Did Bob steal my wedding ring?

497
00:20:11.163 --> 00:20:12.746  
MATT: Uh...

498
00:20:12.746 --> 00:20:13.804
no.

499
00:20:13.804 --> 00:20:16.637  
That would have been too on point.

500
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:19.701  
SAM: Oh boy, this is where we find out Percy got you

501
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:21.618  
a cubic zirconium ring.

502
00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:24.851  
TALIESIN: I made it myself.

503
00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:29.059
(laughter)

504
00:20:30.482 --> 00:20:33.467  
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
SAM: Why isn't it working?

505
00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:35.267  
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to be outside in Pandemonium.

506
00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.548
Excuse me.

507
00:20:36.548 --> 00:20:39.029  
LAURA: It might be worth far more than 500 gold,

508
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:41.682  
but it's something.

509
00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:44.309  
SAM: Is it a diamond?
LAURA: It is a diamond.

510
00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:45.631  
SAM: What cut?

511
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:48.294  
LAURA: It's a princess cut. I don't fucking know.

512
00:20:48.294 --> 00:20:50.294  
SAM: That's a little tacky.

513
00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:54.091  
TALIESIN: We can use it to help stick everything together,

514
00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:56.403  
then, if it's a little tacky, can't we?

515
00:20:56.403 --> 00:20:57.893  
ASHLEY: I'll go double check to see if there's

516
00:20:57.893 --> 00:21:00.236  
any head bits outside.
SAM: Sure sure.

517
00:21:00.236 --> 00:21:01.285  
MATT: Okay.

518
00:21:01.285 --> 00:21:02.895  
MARISHA: I'll join Pike to make sure nothing bad happens.

519
00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:04.630  
SAM: Can we only talk to Matt when he's just taken a bite?

520
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.357  
MATT: Yes, please, this is why I don't eat during the game.

521
00:21:08.357 --> 00:21:11.917  
TRAVIS: I will also join Pike because I missed her so much.

522
00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:14.090  
ASHLEY: Oh Grog.
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

523
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.195  
ASHLEY: That's my best buddy!
TRAVIS: I know! Give me a hug!

524
00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:20.622  
MATT: So I'm going to have Pike and Keyleth either

525
00:21:20.622 --> 00:21:22.638  
each individually make investigation checks

526
00:21:22.638 --> 00:21:24.772  
or one of you make it with advantage. Your call.

527
00:21:24.772 --> 00:21:25.855  
AMRISHA: How's your investigation?

528
00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:29.790  
How's your Pikey Pike investigatey-gatey.

529
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.547  
SAM: Just do it. Just do it.
LAURA: Just both of you do it.

530
00:21:33.547 --> 00:21:36.597  
ASHLEY: It's only one.
MARISHA: One for, okay okay.

531
00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.379  
We'll each roll. We'll each roll.

532
00:21:38.379 --> 00:21:40.471  
ASHLEY: We'll each roll? Okay.

533
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:42.777  
MARISHA: Do we do the searching for a contact thing?

534
00:21:42.777 --> 00:21:44.735  
That's okay. 14.

535
00:21:44.735 --> 00:21:46.027  
ASHLEY: 18.

536
00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:47.890  
MATT: 18, okay.

537
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.518  
You find a couple of errant scraps of Lieve'tel

538
00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:53.737  
to complete the puzzle.

539
00:21:53.737 --> 00:21:54.702  
SAM: Great.

540
00:21:54.702 --> 00:21:55.983  
LAURA: Oh cool.

541
00:21:55.983 --> 00:22:00.233  
MARISHA: Oh look, I also found a fossil, that's awesome.

542
00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:01.599  
ASHLEY: Cool.

543
00:22:02.494 --> 00:22:03.610  
TRAVIS: Are you going to put stuff back in

544
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.793
that doesn't belong?

545
00:22:06.689 --> 00:22:08.449  
MATT: She didn't quite come back right.

546
00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:09.630  
TRAVIS: Thank you for saving my life. What the fuck?!

547
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.476  
LIAM: New powers.
SAM: There's an arrowhead.

548
00:22:12.476 --> 00:22:13.809  
TALIESIN: I believe you're supposed to leave those

549
00:22:13.809 --> 00:22:15.294  
when you find them right. You're not actually

550
00:22:15.294 --> 00:22:17.289  
supposed to take them. That's fine.

551
00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:18.445  
MARISHA: Oh, don't tell anybody.

552
00:22:18.445 --> 00:22:20.605  
TALIESIN: No, if we all took one,

553
00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:24.341  
they would all be gone very quickly.

554
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:25.549  
LIAM: Yeah, guys, take your time so I can eat

555
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:26.382  
all of these cinnamon rolls.

556
00:22:26.382 --> 00:22:28.030  
ASHLEY: I think we got all the bits.

557
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.158  
SAM: Shove them in there. What would you like

558
00:22:32.158 --> 00:22:36.865  
to use? Your wedding ring or a bit of magic?

559
00:22:36.865 --> 00:22:39.477  
TALIESIN: Just an excuse to throw a party & get another one.

560
00:22:39.477 --> 00:22:43.128  
LAURA: You know, everyone wasn't at the first one.

561
00:22:45.183 --> 00:22:48.273  
TALIESIN: I think this is a wonderful idea.

562
00:22:48.273 --> 00:22:50.170  
LAURA: Would that be allowed?

563
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.428  
MATT: Using your wedding ring as a component?

564
00:22:51.428 --> 00:22:53.294
Yeah, it would.

565
00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:56.581  
SAM: Wow, that's love.

566
00:22:56.581 --> 00:22:58.272  
ASHLEY: Okay.

567
00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:01.814  
Let me do my thing and then--

568
00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:03.580  
Okay, I'll put that down.

569
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.125
I'm going to mush all her face back together.

570
00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:11.125
(laughter)

571
00:23:11.774 --> 00:23:14.462  
ASHLEY: Maybe an extra bit in there.

572
00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:15.895  
MATT: An extra bit?
TRAVIS: Of what?

573
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.170
ASHLEY: I don't know, but just

574
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.198  
on the outside so she can pull it out

575
00:23:19.198 --> 00:23:20.789  
if she wanted.
MARISHA: Give her the fossil piece.

576
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:25.722
Maybe it will make a cool cyborg.

577
00:23:25.722 --> 00:23:27.118  
LIAM: You guys are all literally the worst

578
00:23:27.118 --> 00:23:29.436  
and I love you so much.

579
00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:31.711  
MARISHA: She could-- It'd be like a battle scar.

580
00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:34.410  
ASHLEY: A battle scar. It could also be like a hair clip.

581
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.291  
LIAM: Wear it like a unicorn horn.

582
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:39.041
MATT: You're not there. Shh!

583
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.205  
MARISHA: I think if you make it like a plate,

584
00:23:42.205 --> 00:23:44.444  
like a scar plate, uh-huh.

585
00:23:44.444 --> 00:23:45.902  
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to make it like a plate.

586
00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:46.830  
MARISHA: That's rad.

587
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.963  
ASHLEY: Put everything together

588
00:23:48.963 --> 00:23:50.274
real nice.
MARISHA: I think she'll appreciate

589
00:23:50.274 --> 00:23:51.782  
us making these body modifications

590
00:23:51.782 --> 00:23:52.615  
for her.
ASHLEY: I think she'll really

591
00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:54.554  
like it.
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so, too.

592
00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:57.420  
ASHLEY: It's like she has like a souvenir from Pandemonium.

593
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.180  
MARISHA: Exactly!

594
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.150  
Who wouldn't want to remember this incredible time?

595
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.576  
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit over by the fire and ignore this.

596
00:24:03.576 --> 00:24:05.537  
MATT: I'm just envisioning a Subway sandwich artist

597
00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:06.718  
and there's too much stuff in the sandwich

598
00:24:06.718 --> 00:24:07.979  
and they're trying to hold it closed.

599
00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:11.029
(laughter)
LIAM: Roll it up in the paper.

600
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:13.422
TALIESIN: Thanks for saying artist.

601
00:24:13.422 --> 00:24:17.550  
That makes me feel better. That was a call back.

602
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.196  
ASHLEY: All right.
TRAVIS: It'll fit. It'll fit.

603
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:20.029  
ASHLEY: Wait, I was casting--

604
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.839
SAM and TALIESIN: It's level five.

605
00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:24.827  
MATT: Is it Raise Dead?
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Raise Dead.

606
00:24:24.827 --> 00:24:26.474  
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:24:26.474 --> 00:24:29.406  
MATT: All right. You're all here

608
00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:33.806  
within Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion. You watch as

609
00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:38.110  
Pike scrawls out the familiar arcane-- or this would be

610
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.614  
divine circle in this space, drawing the lines.

611
00:24:41.614 --> 00:24:43.196  
You've gone through this process a number of times

612
00:24:43.196 --> 00:24:47.821  
with your friends. A little less familiar this time,

613
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:50.318  
but nevertheless an individual who has made

614
00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:53.070  
quite a sacrifice and put some of your heart and energy

615
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.653  
into bringing back from the realm where her

616
00:24:58.569 --> 00:25:03.214  
god holds supreme, that transition.

617
00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:05.390  
Upon reaching out to tug against the spirit

618
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.350  
of one who worships the Raven Queen,

619
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.062  
let's go ahead and complete a resurrection ritual.

620
00:25:10.062 --> 00:25:13.982  
Who would like to apply first to this?

621
00:25:13.982 --> 00:25:17.051  
LIAM: Give me your heartfelt feelings after six hours.

622
00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:20.174  
SAM: I will contribute to this ritual.

623
00:25:20.174 --> 00:25:21.246  
MATT: Yes, you will.

624
00:25:21.246 --> 00:25:23.582  
SAM: I will excuse myself and then come back

625
00:25:23.582 --> 00:25:25.915  
holding a small lump of poo.

626
00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:31.525  
TALIESIN: It's nice of you to excuse yourself.

627
00:25:31.525 --> 00:25:35.329  
LIAM: Speckled.
(laughter)

628
00:25:35.329 --> 00:25:37.954  
TRAVIS: How long were you gone?
MATT: Oh god!

629
00:25:37.954 --> 00:25:40.579  
You fucking asshole!

630
00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:43.595  
SAM: I was gone for almost 15 minutes.

631
00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:46.407  
I like to do some reading.

632
00:25:46.407 --> 00:25:48.207  
TRAVIS: So you said, "I'll go first,"

633
00:25:48.207 --> 00:25:50.032
and then left for 15 minutes?

634
00:25:50.032 --> 00:25:52.075  
(laughter)

635
00:25:52.075 --> 00:25:56.217  
SAM: After some grunting. It's hard to go on command.

636
00:25:56.217 --> 00:25:59.179  
ASHLEY: What did you read?

637
00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:02.891  
SAM: I read-- I don't-- maybe I read a love letter

638
00:26:02.891 --> 00:26:05.315  
I had written to you from before.

639
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:06.786  
LAURA: Oh, nothing makes you poo faster.

640
00:26:06.786 --> 00:26:08.152  
SAM: Just to proofread it and make sure.

641
00:26:08.152 --> 00:26:11.318  
TRAVIS: Keep those in the bathroom.

642
00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:16.049  
SAM: I will take my little poop and I will

643
00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:17.828  
just smear a little bit right across her--

644
00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:19.432  
LAURA: Oh fucking gross.

645
00:26:19.432 --> 00:26:24.432  
SAM: Her forehead and sort of bless the ritual

646
00:26:25.075 --> 00:26:27.829  
inspire the ritual somehow, I don't know,

647
00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:31.413  
by composing a limerick to her.

648
00:26:31.413 --> 00:26:33.558  
MATT: All right.

649
00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:36.225  
SAM: Oh our handsome dummy Mr. Bell

650
00:26:37.879 --> 00:26:40.796  
and our creepy new friend Lieve'tel

651
00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:46.015  
to welcome them to the group I shall give them both my poop

652
00:26:46.015 --> 00:26:49.348  
to honor them with my mark and my smell.

653
00:26:50.232 --> 00:26:51.848  
ASHLEY: Oh wow.

654
00:26:51.848 --> 00:26:52.952  
SAM: And I hope that does something.

655
00:26:52.952 --> 00:26:55.064  
MATT: Roll a persuasion check with disadvantage.

656
00:26:55.064 --> 00:26:56.423  
SAM: Disadvantage?

657
00:26:56.423 --> 00:26:58.008  
MATT: Because you just put poop on her head!

658
00:26:58.008 --> 00:26:59.528  
SAM: Okay.

659
00:26:59.528 --> 00:27:00.824  
MATT: But you're still really good with persuasion.

660
00:27:00.824 --> 00:27:02.757  
SAM: I rolled a two, so that's 20.

661
00:27:02.757 --> 00:27:04.888  
(laughter)

662
00:27:04.888 --> 00:27:07.555  
MATT: That reduces the DC.

663
00:27:07.555 --> 00:27:09.380
MARISHA: What?!

664
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.905
SAM: According to CritRoleStats,

665
00:27:10.905 --> 00:27:13.354
I've got a persuasion of plus 18.

666
00:27:13.354 --> 00:27:16.177  
LAURA: Well, I have a stealth of 17, so that makes sense.

667
00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:17.802  
MATT: Yep.

668
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:20.643
All right and as you

669
00:27:20.643 --> 00:27:24.618
smear the trail across the forehead

670
00:27:24.618 --> 00:27:27.317  
in a very like Simba fashion.

671
00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:30.142  
SAM and TALIESIN: Simba.

672
00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:31.695  
TRAVIS: It is time.

673
00:27:33.857 --> 00:27:37.732  
MATT: You sense the

674
00:27:37.732 --> 00:27:40.556
soul of Lieve'tel,

675
00:27:40.556 --> 00:27:45.556
who still resides being dragged across the various realms,

676
00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:49.204  
tugged a little closer to where the body was,

677
00:27:49.204 --> 00:27:54.204  
as if out of mere anger

678
00:27:54.437 --> 00:27:56.578
at what you've done to her corpse.

679
00:27:56.578 --> 00:27:58.388  
All right. Anybody else would like to--?

680
00:27:58.388 --> 00:28:00.721  
TRAVIS: Who's up for Le'veon Bell?

681
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.910
LAURA: I'll step forward. Oh god,

682
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.709
I don't have anything to offer.
ASHLEY: Oh Lieve'tel.

683
00:28:07.709 --> 00:28:09.459
TRAVIS: Lieve'tel?

684
00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:10.716  
ASHLEY: Yeah.

685
00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:12.024  
LIAM: Raven Queen listened to all that

686
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:14.742
and was like, "That tracks."

687
00:28:14.742 --> 00:28:18.324  
SAM: Anyone want to help our friend?

688
00:28:18.324 --> 00:28:19.924  
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, just trying to think

689
00:28:19.924 --> 00:28:22.751  
of what to give for it.

690
00:28:22.751 --> 00:28:24.260  
MARISHA: Do we have to physically give something?

691
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.889  
LAURA: I mean, I already gave a fucking wedding ring

692
00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:27.090  
so it kind of--
ASHLEY: Yeah, you already

693
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.574  
gave her your wedding ring.

694
00:28:30.574 --> 00:28:32.532  
SAM: Have some magic or something?

695
00:28:32.532 --> 00:28:34.450  
ASHLEY: I mean, we did give her that cool fossil.

696
00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.741  
MARISHA: We did.

697
00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:37.828  
MATT: Doesn't have to be an object. It can be words,

698
00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:40.068  
it can be an object, it can be an offering.

699
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:41.892  
It could be anything of what you think would be

700
00:28:41.892 --> 00:28:46.260  
a way to call a spirit back from the dead.

701
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.235  
LAURA: Okay, all right I'll step forward.

702
00:28:51.803 --> 00:28:53.603  
All right.

703
00:28:55.136 --> 00:28:58.602  
Well, you came here for us

704
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.526
and we just lost

705
00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:07.963  
someone we loved very much and you

706
00:29:09.238 --> 00:29:10.871  
were saying you were going to be with us

707
00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:14.071  
because of that and now you're gone as well

708
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:16.162  
and I think that's pretty shitty,

709
00:29:16.162 --> 00:29:18.053
hence the poop.

710
00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:23.512  
So I'd appreciate if you came back

711
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:24.703
and proved to us

712
00:29:24.703 --> 00:29:27.437  
that the Raven Queen doesn't suck complete balls.

713
00:29:27.437 --> 00:29:29.228  
ASHLEY: Yeah.

714
00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:33.908  
LAURA: Maybe give us something to believe in.

715
00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:36.831  
That's all.

716
00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:38.606  
MARISHA: That was a--

717
00:29:38.606 --> 00:29:40.131
ASHLEY: Amen.

718
00:29:41.593 --> 00:29:42.426
MATT: Okay.

719
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:47.070  
There's already been a persuasion roll,

720
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.279  
so I'll allow a second one which will be a much higher DC.

721
00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:50.862  
LAURA: Oh fuck.

722
00:29:50.862 --> 00:29:55.244  
MATT: I should have sung a song or some shit. I don't know.

723
00:29:55.244 --> 00:30:00.244  
Or done a like acrobatics move or something.

724
00:30:00.287 --> 00:30:01.855  
MATT: I'll tell you what. You can take a persuasion

725
00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:06.855  
with disadvantage or an intimidation with a single roll.

726
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.788  
LAURA: No, I'll take the persuasion.
MATT: Okay.

727
00:30:09.788 --> 00:30:13.557
LAURA: (sings)
LIAM: Guys, this is beautiful.

728
00:30:13.557 --> 00:30:14.698  
SAM: Yeah it is.

729
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:19.620
LAURA: Ooh, oh no!

730
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.527  
Persuasion 13.

731
00:30:22.527 --> 00:30:23.985  
MATT: 13?

732
00:30:23.985 --> 00:30:27.587  
I don't know, something about the not heartened

733
00:30:27.587 --> 00:30:30.175  
attempt at reaching out to someone you really

734
00:30:30.175 --> 00:30:32.520  
have no care, who for just reminds you of a sad part in your

735
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.319  
life didn't seem to really give

736
00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:39.006
a heavier tether to the realm.

737
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:41.151  
LAURA: Somebody do something really good

738
00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:42.462  
because I didn't feel anything.

739
00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:43.420  
SAM: Grog?
MARISHA: I'm afraid

740
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.847  
I'd pretty much have the same mood.

741
00:30:44.847 --> 00:30:47.301  
LAURA: You have something, Grog?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

742
00:30:47.301 --> 00:30:49.318  
TRAVIS: Put that down.
ASHLEY: Okay.

743
00:30:49.318 --> 00:30:51.551  
TRAVIS: Does anyone else want to go?

744
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:55.327  
SAM: No, but this person was vital in saving your life.

745
00:30:55.327 --> 00:30:56.559  
LAURA: Yes, yes.

746
00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:58.958  
TRAVIS: No, I realize.

747
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:02.398  
SAM: She gave her life for yours, so make it count.

748
00:31:02.398 --> 00:31:05.947  
TRAVIS: Okay (clears throat).

749
00:31:08.547 --> 00:31:13.547  
Hello, my name is Grog Strongjaw.

750
00:31:14.141 --> 00:31:19.141  
We have not had the ability to meet.

751
00:31:19.997 --> 00:31:24.739  
I appreciate the meat that is coming out of your dome.

752
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.551  
However, since we have not had

753
00:31:29.551 --> 00:31:32.292
the pleasure of acquainting--

754
00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:34.228
SAM: Yes!

755
00:31:34.228 --> 00:31:36.217  
ASHLEY: That's so good! That's a good one.

756
00:31:36.217 --> 00:31:40.404  
TRAVIS: I hope that you will consider coming back to life

757
00:31:40.404 --> 00:31:45.371  
so that I may thank you properly for protecting my friends.

758
00:31:46.722 --> 00:31:51.230  
That being said, (yelling) get your fucking ass up

759
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.436  
because no one dies around Vox Machina!

760
00:31:54.436 --> 00:31:57.346  
We've had too many deaths already and I swear I will

761
00:31:57.346 --> 00:32:01.504  
beat you all over this room until you die a second time.

762
00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:03.556  
MATT: Roll an intimidation check

763
00:32:03.556 --> 00:32:04.606
using your strength modifier.

764
00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:06.132  
LAURA: Woo.

765
00:32:06.132 --> 00:32:09.579  
LIAM: Whatever happens here, it will be interesting.

766
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:14.228  
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
(cheering)

767
00:32:14.228 --> 00:32:15.061  
LAURA: You fucking dick!

768
00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:17.744
SAM and MARISHA: Three in a row.

769
00:32:19.254 --> 00:32:21.565  
LAURA: You--
SAM: Wow.

770
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:25.412  
TRAVIS: Sometimes your character and you are one.

771
00:32:25.412 --> 00:32:28.329  
(laughter)

772
00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:32.260
LAURA: You fucking-- are you serious?!

773
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.927  
TRAVIS: It takes a certain level of legendary hero

774
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.713  
to threaten a spirit to return to the body.

775
00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:44.611  
We shall see if it is enough.

776
00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:50.003  
The natural 20 that reduces it further

777
00:32:50.003 --> 00:32:53.087  
so we're looking at-- eight--

778
00:32:53.087 --> 00:32:55.112  
TRAVIS: We've done all we can.

779
00:32:55.987 --> 00:32:57.627  
LAURA: Oh no, what is it?
MATT: DC was four,

780
00:32:57.627 --> 00:32:59.152  
rolled a five.

781
00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:04.098
'Cause it reduced it to an eight to a six

782
00:33:04.098 --> 00:33:06.580  
and because you rolled a natural 20 it brought it to a four.

783
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.492  
SAM: Whoa.

784
00:33:07.492 --> 00:33:09.681  
LAURA: But wait eight to a six, but I failed.

785
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:12.404  
MATT: Yeah, no you failed but he rolled a natural 20

786
00:33:12.404 --> 00:33:16.324  
so I doubled it down for the hell of it.

787
00:33:16.324 --> 00:33:20.157  
So with a

788
00:33:22.164 --> 00:33:26.289
momentary, not terribly tense pause,

789
00:33:27.508 --> 00:33:29.241  
(laughs)

790
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:35.208
you hear the (inhale) breath come back into Lieve'tel's body

791
00:33:35.326 --> 00:33:38.056
TRAVIS: Hey hey! Hoo hoo!

792
00:33:38.056 --> 00:33:40.036  
SAM: You did it, Grog.
TRAVIS: We did it!

793
00:33:40.036 --> 00:33:41.669  
LAURA: What does she look like?

794
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:43.347  
Is it healed or is it just--?

795
00:33:43.347 --> 00:33:47.092  
MATT: It is healed. The fossil is still partially lodged

796
00:33:47.092 --> 00:33:49.972  
in the skull. The headache is atrocious,

797
00:33:49.972 --> 00:33:54.578  
as is the smell, Lieve'tel, but life has brought itself

798
00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:58.536  
to you once more. Your time is not done.

799
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.244  
Apparently there is more

800
00:34:00.244 --> 00:34:01.838  
the Raven Queen has in store for you.

801
00:34:01.838 --> 00:34:04.788  
LIAM: I have not pierced the veil

802
00:34:04.788 --> 00:34:09.106
in 107 years.

803
00:34:09.106 --> 00:34:13.444  
You are an interesting bunch. (sniffs) Is that fecal matter?

804
00:34:13.444 --> 00:34:17.076  
SAM: No, no, it's life.

805
00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:19.236  
Welcome back.
ASHLEY: Yes, welcome back.

806
00:34:19.236 --> 00:34:24.236  
TRAVIS: Hi, my name is Grog.

807
00:34:24.676 --> 00:34:28.404  
I wanted to thank you in person for coming to rescue me

808
00:34:28.404 --> 00:34:33.265  
and for protecting my friends.
ASHLEY: Yes.

809
00:34:33.265 --> 00:34:37.460  
LIAM: Very much worth the trouble, young man.

810
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.293  
TRAVIS: Oh!

811
00:34:39.724 --> 00:34:44.484  
LIAM: I think I need a moment or two. Is there a bathroom

812
00:34:44.484 --> 00:34:47.044  
and where are we?
SAM: Well, you're in

813
00:34:47.044 --> 00:34:49.268  
a mansion in the middle of Pandemonium.

814
00:34:49.268 --> 00:34:50.725  
LAURA: A magnificent mansion.
SAM: It's my place.

815
00:34:50.725 --> 00:34:52.853  
MARISHA: There's a cheese platter.

816
00:34:52.853 --> 00:34:55.592  
SAM: There are refreshments.
ASHLEY: Chicken.

817
00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:57.233  
SAM: No chicken anymore.
LAURA: He doesn't eat

818
00:34:57.233 --> 00:34:58.708
chicken anymore.

819
00:34:58.708 --> 00:35:00.372  
SAM: I'm a vegan.
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot about that.

820
00:35:00.372 --> 00:35:02.032  
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all fuck up.
LAURA: It's all beans

821
00:35:02.032 --> 00:35:03.252  
and lentils and shit.
SAM: It's all right.

822
00:35:03.252 --> 00:35:05.476  
They make it seem like it's meat.

823
00:35:05.476 --> 00:35:06.948  
ASHLEY: It tastes like chicken.
SAM: Yeah.

824
00:35:06.948 --> 00:35:08.612  
TALIESIN: It really doesn't.

825
00:35:08.612 --> 00:35:10.468  
SAM: Anyway, there's some lovely facilities

826
00:35:10.468 --> 00:35:13.490  
and you can even use a room here.

827
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.092  
LIAM: I'm just going to, you know--

828
00:35:15.092 --> 00:35:18.077  
SAM: Freshen up?
LIAM: Yes.

829
00:35:18.077 --> 00:35:20.341  
ASHLEY: That was a--
LIAM: Do I have a mark here?

830
00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:22.596  
SAM: From the battle, from the battle.

831
00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:25.332  
ASHLEY: It's actually--
MARISHA: Super cool.

832
00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:28.959  
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was a fossil that she found outside.

833
00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:30.644  
TRAVIS: I don't know you from beforehand,

834
00:35:30.644 --> 00:35:33.729  
but I think you're rather striking.

835
00:35:33.729 --> 00:35:35.396  
LIAM: Well, that is true.

836
00:35:37.053 --> 00:35:40.227  
I'll be back. We'll get to know each other better.

837
00:35:40.227 --> 00:35:42.068  
Which way to the--
LAURA: Were you hitting

838
00:35:42.068 --> 00:35:43.742  
on that elf?
SAM: You know, the mansion

839
00:35:43.742 --> 00:35:47.775  
changes shape a lot, but I think third door on your left.

840
00:35:47.775 --> 00:35:51.296  
LIAM: You're sure? I have been in places like this before.

841
00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:54.335  
SAM: No, I'm quite certain. You know what, I'll have

842
00:35:54.335 --> 00:35:57.474  
one of my servants accompany you. (claps)

843
00:35:57.474 --> 00:35:59.557  
Ladies.

844
00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:03.378  
MATT: About a half dozen spectral female servants

845
00:36:03.378 --> 00:36:08.203  
come rushing over with nice dresses,

846
00:36:08.203 --> 00:36:11.842  
coming over and guide your arms and shoulders

847
00:36:11.842 --> 00:36:15.138  
gently in the direction of the water closet to freshen up.

848
00:36:15.138 --> 00:36:18.135  
LIAM: Excellent. I'll be back, everyone.

849
00:36:18.135 --> 00:36:20.674  
LAURA: Take your time.

850
00:36:20.674 --> 00:36:22.452  
Get that shit off your head.

851
00:36:22.452 --> 00:36:25.474  
TRAVIS: Yo, nicely done.
ASHLEY: You, too!

852
00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:29.231  
You just really just inspired her to come back.

853
00:36:29.231 --> 00:36:30.702  
TRAVIS: Is that what I did?
ASHLEY: Yes, you did.

854
00:36:30.702 --> 00:36:33.002  
TRAVIS: I was actually quite angry at the end there,

855
00:36:33.002 --> 00:36:34.585
but I don't need any more heartache.

856
00:36:34.585 --> 00:36:36.786  
ASHLEY: Sometimes you just need a good pep talk

857
00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:39.090  
if you're dead.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess

858
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.306  
that's what I did, didn't I?

859
00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:41.456  
ASHLEY: I think you did.
TRAVIS: Thanks, man!

860
00:36:41.456 --> 00:36:44.096  
ASHLEY: Yeah, you did a good job.

861
00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:46.193  
TALIESIN: There are some side effects, I should mention.

862
00:36:46.193 --> 00:36:47.793  
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
SAM: Of what?

863
00:36:47.793 --> 00:36:49.442  
TALIESIN: Well, this is not a perfect spell.

864
00:36:49.442 --> 00:36:53.276  
It does have some issues.

865
00:36:53.276 --> 00:36:54.914  
TRAVIS: Issues?
TALIESIN: Well, I didn't know

866
00:36:54.914 --> 00:36:56.930  
it was going to work so I didn't mention anything.

867
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.938  
MATT: You both have gone through this process previously.

868
00:36:59.938 --> 00:37:02.335  
It takes a few days for you to recover from the effects of

869
00:37:02.335 --> 00:37:04.750  
being pulled back from beyond the veil.

870
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:05.682  
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

871
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.824  
MATT: From a mechanical standpoint, Lieve'tel

872
00:37:07.824 --> 00:37:09.954  
is at minus four to all attack rolls,

873
00:37:09.954 --> 00:37:11.666  
saving throws, and ability checks

874
00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:14.866  
and the net penalty is reduced by one after every long rest.

875
00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:17.154  
LAURA: If we sleep, she'll do better.

876
00:37:17.154 --> 00:37:18.514  
MATT: Yeah, she'll be minus three.

877
00:37:18.514 --> 00:37:19.538  
LAURA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: You can also,

878
00:37:19.538 --> 00:37:21.970  
I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong,

879
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.262  
burn a Greater Restoration

880
00:37:25.262 --> 00:37:28.844  
and knock that down one more, I believe, in a pinch.

881
00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:30.642  
MATT: I will double check that.

882
00:37:30.642 --> 00:37:31.890  
TRAVIS: Well, that is amazing.

883
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.786  
Now, may I ask you all now that we're all safe and sound

884
00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:37.810  
and enjoying these shitty salads,

885
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.666  
so you fought your way to the top of a castle?

886
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.152  
TALIESIN: We did.
TRAVIS: Right.

887
00:37:43.152 --> 00:37:47.103  
Did you, like, decimate everything on your way through?

888
00:37:47.103 --> 00:37:48.303  
TALIESIN: Well!

889
00:37:48.303 --> 00:37:49.978
SAM: Time was of the essence, Grog,

890
00:37:49.978 --> 00:37:51.776  
so we actually skipped a lot of the fighting.

891
00:37:51.776 --> 00:37:55.026  
We did fight some wolves?

892
00:37:55.026 --> 00:37:57.580  
MARISHA: Yeah, big hella hound things.

893
00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.230  
TRAVIS: Hella hounds?

894
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.780
MARISHA: Yeah, holla hounds.
TRAVIS: Hella.

895
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.154  
SAM: And we passed by a monster or two.

896
00:38:05.154 --> 00:38:10.049  
MARISHA: We successfully sneaked past a big demon guy

897
00:38:10.049 --> 00:38:12.802  
doing wall art.
TRAVIS: What? Sneak?

898
00:38:12.802 --> 00:38:15.885  
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You mean like he's still--?

899
00:38:15.885 --> 00:38:16.718  
MARISHA: Yeah!

900
00:38:16.718 --> 00:38:20.981
SAM: Yes. Do we have to go back through this

901
00:38:20.981 --> 00:38:22.830
labyrinth of horrors to get down or--
TALIESIN: We have actually

902
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.392  
discussed how we're getting home, but we didn't--

903
00:38:25.392 --> 00:38:27.649  
LAURA: Go over the side maybe.

904
00:38:27.649 --> 00:38:29.032  
TALIESIN: I think he's speaking--

905
00:38:29.032 --> 00:38:30.582
you're speaking of the entire--

906
00:38:30.582 --> 00:38:33.234  
SAM: No no, I was speaking specifically about

907
00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:35.986  
we're on top of something that we need to get off of.

908
00:38:35.986 --> 00:38:37.778  
TALIESIN: Well, if I recall quite a bit of it fell

909
00:38:37.778 --> 00:38:39.762  
so I think we're much closer to the ground at this point.

910
00:38:39.762 --> 00:38:43.356  
MATT: No, like ten feet

911
00:38:43.356 --> 00:38:45.784  
of some walls fell.
TALIESIN: Well, that's a bit.

912
00:38:45.784 --> 00:38:49.094  
LAURA: We do have an endless rope.

913
00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:52.077  
SAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Perhaps on me.

914
00:38:52.077 --> 00:38:53.455  
TRAVIS: Did you want to go back down?

915
00:38:53.455 --> 00:38:55.762  
SAM: Oh, probably in the Bag of Holding.

916
00:38:55.762 --> 00:38:57.250  
LAURA: In the Bag of Holding.
MATT: Yeah...

917
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.608  
MARISHA: I could turn us into clouds

918
00:38:58.608 --> 00:39:00.418
and we could just float down.

919
00:39:00.418 --> 00:39:01.759  
SAM: That always works.
TALIESIN: It does always work.

920
00:39:01.759 --> 00:39:03.694  
TRAVIS: Is it a problem it's real windy outside?

921
00:39:03.694 --> 00:39:05.554  
TALIESIN: It's extremely windy.

922
00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:07.195  
LAURA: Can we control our clouds?

923
00:39:07.195 --> 00:39:08.847  
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

924
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:12.783  
TALIESIN: Yay.
TRAVIS: Do you want help with that?

925
00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.834  
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.
MARISHA: Can I use wisdom?

926
00:39:14.834 --> 00:39:16.492  
I'm not wise about the weather?

927
00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:18.063  
No?

928
00:39:18.063 --> 00:39:20.512  
Oh, just straight intelligence, right?

929
00:39:20.512 --> 00:39:21.661  
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: 19.

930
00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:26.258  
MATT: 19. That'd be a <i>bad</i> idea. (laughs)

931
00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:27.762  
MARISHA: It would be a bad idea.

932
00:39:27.762 --> 00:39:29.314  
MATT: You guys would be kites in a wind storm.

933
00:39:29.314 --> 00:39:30.802  
ASHLEY: We can always just climb down.

934
00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:33.103  
LAURA and SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

935
00:39:33.103 --> 00:39:35.138  
TRAVIS: Are you sure you don't want to go back down

936
00:39:35.138 --> 00:39:38.590  
by the big nasty now that you got your--?

937
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:41.662  
TALIESIN: I don't think it quite--

938
00:39:41.662 --> 00:39:44.066  
I think we want to get our stuff back and get out.

939
00:39:44.066 --> 00:39:45.264  
TRAVIS: Oh okay.

940
00:39:45.264 --> 00:39:47.622  
LAURA: Here's the thing, we don't have any powerful spells

941
00:39:47.622 --> 00:39:49.078  
because we don't have any components.

942
00:39:49.078 --> 00:39:50.971  
TRAVIS: No problem, I've never had those.

943
00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:52.398  
LAURA: Yes, but other people do.

944
00:39:52.398 --> 00:39:54.976  
TRAVIS: Oh right yep, you do.

945
00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:58.258  
MARISHA: Could I Animal Shapes us into things that fly,

946
00:39:58.258 --> 00:40:00.306  
would that be a bad idea?

947
00:40:00.306 --> 00:40:03.499  
MATT: I mean, it will be difficult.

948
00:40:03.499 --> 00:40:05.538  
MARISHA: So still flying, just flying is a bad idea?

949
00:40:05.538 --> 00:40:08.287  
LAURA: Flying-- I didn't want to bust out my broom up here.

950
00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:10.626  
MATT: It's possible.

951
00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:12.632  
It's just going to be difficult,

952
00:40:12.632 --> 00:40:14.706  
like the wind is pretty intense around here

953
00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:16.754  
and it feels like it's near

954
00:40:16.754 --> 00:40:18.925  
perpetual hurricane without the moisture.

955
00:40:18.925 --> 00:40:22.450  
TRAVIS: Do we know how long of a fall it is from the top

956
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.638  
to the ground because I could always just like,

957
00:40:25.638 --> 00:40:28.690  
"Wee!" (splat) eat it a little bit and I catch everybody.

958
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.766  
TALIESIN: Oh, we'd have to resurrect you again.

959
00:40:29.766 --> 00:40:32.943  
That would be such fun.
TRAVIS: I could take it.

960
00:40:32.943 --> 00:40:35.602  
MARISHA: If it's a thousand feet, it's a bad idea.

961
00:40:35.602 --> 00:40:36.930  
TRAVIS: Is it a thousand feet?

962
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.729  
MARISHA: It-- probably.

963
00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:40.562  
TRAVIS: Jeez.

964
00:40:40.562 --> 00:40:43.395  
MATT: It's been quite a climb up here.

965
00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:47.058  
You don't have a good scope, necessarily,

966
00:40:47.058 --> 00:40:49.074  
because you guys spent a lot of it climbing

967
00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:51.442  
in the interior of the tower, but you've been traveling

968
00:40:51.442 --> 00:40:55.858  
upwards over an hour, like two plus hours

969
00:40:55.858 --> 00:40:59.186  
to get up through to the top of the tower.

970
00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:02.622  
LIAM: Should we assume that any spell that takes

971
00:41:02.622 --> 00:41:04.722  
any material components is busted right now?

972
00:41:04.722 --> 00:41:06.580  
MATT: No, you can cast any spell that has

973
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.521
material components that don't cost money.

974
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:10.162
Or have a money cost involved.

975
00:41:10.162 --> 00:41:11.970  
LIAM: While they're having this discussion,

976
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.482  
Lieve'tel is casting Regenerate on her forehead

977
00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:17.327  
to return it to is pristine condition,

978
00:41:17.327 --> 00:41:20.231  
and Thaumaturgy to clean the gnome shit off her face.

979
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:21.897  
MATT: Okay.

980
00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:24.226  
LAURA: Thaumaturgy doesn't clean shit.

981
00:41:24.226 --> 00:41:25.709  
LIAM: People have--

982
00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:28.249
LAURA: Prestidigitation. Thaumaturgy makes

983
00:41:28.249 --> 00:41:30.398  
your eyes change color.
LIAM: Then I'll use water then.

984
00:41:30.398 --> 00:41:31.623
MATT: Yeah, water, water

985
00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:33.312  
actually does that job as well.

986
00:41:33.312 --> 00:41:34.587  
SAM: And napkins.

987
00:41:37.087 --> 00:41:39.511  
MARISHA: We should Heroes' Feast before we got to sleep,

988
00:41:39.511 --> 00:41:41.004  
because we forgot that.
MATT: You hear a (popping)

989
00:41:41.004 --> 00:41:45.488  
as the fossil

990
00:41:45.488 --> 00:41:46.721  
just ejects itself from--

991
00:41:46.721 --> 00:41:49.137
TALIESIN: Heroes' Feast costs components.

992
00:41:49.137 --> 00:41:49.998  
MARISHA: Oh the bowls.

993
00:41:49.998 --> 00:41:52.458  
Fuck. Never mind.
TALIESIN: He took it all.

994
00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:54.933  
ASHLEY: Oh we can't do Heroes'-- Fuck.

995
00:41:54.933 --> 00:41:57.191  
TRAVIS: I've got an idea. So look, we've got to go down

996
00:41:57.191 --> 00:41:59.528
through the castle thing, right?

997
00:41:59.528 --> 00:42:00.944  
LAURA: Possibly.
TRAVIS: It's like

998
00:42:00.944 --> 00:42:03.840  
somewhere down there, what if we're like, "Yoo-hoo,"

999
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.400  
and we call it up and it comes out, we run down?

1000
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.853  
MARISHA: The painting demon thing?
TRAVIS: Whatever's down there.

1001
00:42:11.853 --> 00:42:15.536  
SAM: We could, but first--is there any sort of magicking

1002
00:42:15.536 --> 00:42:18.413  
we can do to find the location of Bob?

1003
00:42:18.413 --> 00:42:21.318  
LAURA: Yes, I can cast Locate Object.

1004
00:42:21.318 --> 00:42:23.501  
SAM: Without material components?

1005
00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:26.697
and also does that have
a range, a distance range?

1006
00:42:26.697 --> 00:42:30.160  
LAURA: Yes, a thousand feet.
TALIESIN: Scrying, though.

1007
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.777  
SAM: Hmm, yeah, that's not that much.

1008
00:42:31.777 --> 00:42:33.534  
MARISHA: I could scry.
LAURA: Yes, scry.

1009
00:42:33.534 --> 00:42:35.709  
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) I could scry.

1010
00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:38.067
MARISHA: Give me PHB, PHB.

1011
00:42:38.067 --> 00:42:39.775
LAURA: PHB. Fudge pop.

1012
00:42:39.775 --> 00:42:40.608  
TRAVIS: PCP.

1013
00:42:41.566 --> 00:42:43.224
MARISHA: (incredulous noise)

1014
00:42:43.224 --> 00:42:44.912
TALIESIN: 10-4.

1015
00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:47.444  
MARISHA: Let me see how to scry because I'm assuming

1016
00:42:47.444 --> 00:42:49.050  
my scrying eye got stolen?

1017
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.088  
MATT: No, you still have your objects.

1018
00:42:51.088 --> 00:42:52.685  
MARISHA: Oh, I still have my scrying eye?

1019
00:42:52.685 --> 00:42:54.084  
MATT: Whatever you have on you that

1020
00:42:54.084 --> 00:42:55.868
wasn't in the Bag of Holding you still have,

1021
00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:57.518  
unless it's a material component

1022
00:42:57.518 --> 00:42:58.351  
that costs money.

1023
00:42:58.351 --> 00:42:59.533
He didn't rob you of everything you have.

1024
00:42:59.533 --> 00:43:00.366  
LAURA: How did he do that?

1025
00:43:00.366 --> 00:43:02.304  
He must be really good.
SAM: It must be magic.

1026
00:43:02.304 --> 00:43:04.240  
LAURA: It must be magic.
MATT: It's strange,

1027
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.920  
because you watched him the entire time.

1028
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.712  
You saw where he stood like ten feet from you.

1029
00:43:07.712 --> 00:43:09.168  
LAURA: That's right.
MATT: He never came close to you.

1030
00:43:09.168 --> 00:43:13.547  
SAM: Maybe he had invisible servants or something.

1031
00:43:13.547 --> 00:43:17.148  
Or maybe there was like a (gasps). I've heard about

1032
00:43:17.148 --> 00:43:22.065  
some magic where powerful practitioners can stop time.

1033
00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:25.904  
He could have stopped time for us briefly,

1034
00:43:25.904 --> 00:43:28.640  
robbed us all, and then come back.

1035
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.890  
TALIESIN: That seems far fetched.

1036
00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.714
LAURA: I've never heard of
anything like that.

1037
00:43:31.714 --> 00:43:32.588  
That's crazy.

1038
00:43:32.588 --> 00:43:33.738
SAM: I can talk to crazy people.

1039
00:43:33.738 --> 00:43:36.174  
MARISHA: I could scry because I have a--

1040
00:43:36.174 --> 00:43:37.551  
SAM: What'd you say?
MARISHA: I could scry.

1041
00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:38.720  
LAURA: Then do it.
MARISHA: Okay.

1042
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.540  
MARISHA: I scry.
MATT: Okay.

1043
00:43:41.807 --> 00:43:45.006  
As Lieve'tel has finished washing her face

1044
00:43:45.006 --> 00:43:47.264  
and absolving her skull of the errant matter that

1045
00:43:47.264 --> 00:43:49.952  
you've jammed into it during the resurrection process, you

1046
00:43:49.952 --> 00:43:54.397  
lay out the scrying ritual, focusing on and looking for--

1047
00:43:54.397 --> 00:43:56.712  
LAURA: The tuning--

1048
00:43:56.712 --> 00:43:59.570  
MARISHA: The tuning fork for the plane or--?

1049
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.878
SAM: The Bag of Holding.

1050
00:44:00.878 --> 00:44:03.167  
MARISHA: Or the Bag of Holding, right?

1051
00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:05.375  
Is that pretty--?
MATT: It's going to be

1052
00:44:05.375 --> 00:44:06.898  
a person or an object or a place.

1053
00:44:06.898 --> 00:44:08.056  
So it could be the guy,

1054
00:44:08.056 --> 00:44:09.424  
it could be an object he's carrying.

1055
00:44:09.424 --> 00:44:10.800  
It could be any of that stuff. It's up to you.

1056
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.939  
MARISHA: I'll do the guy.

1057
00:44:11.939 --> 00:44:15.121  
In case, you know-- The guy. Bob.

1058
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:16.362  
MATT: Okay, all right.

1059
00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:17.696
ASHLEY: We're searching for Bob.

1060
00:44:17.696 --> 00:44:19.895  
SAM: Yeah, it's the Search for Bob.

1061
00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:21.312
It's the title of the show.

1062
00:44:21.312 --> 00:44:23.120  
MATT: Your spell DC is--?

1063
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.328
SAM: He already fenced all the stuff.

1064
00:44:28.328 --> 00:44:29.811
TALIESIN: I don't remember how any of this works.

1065
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:31.329  
MARISHA: 20.

1066
00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:32.162  
MATT: Okay.

1067
00:44:34.406 --> 00:44:39.406  
As your vision begins to emerge and push itself

1068
00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:44.278  
into the wind storm, you feel yourself being drawn

1069
00:44:44.278 --> 00:44:48.328  
through this intense battering buffet of wind

1070
00:44:48.328 --> 00:44:51.761  
from every direction. (whooshing)

1071
00:44:51.761 --> 00:44:53.702
And you continue to be drawn through

1072
00:44:53.702 --> 00:44:56.889  
in this arc. You sense a direction

1073
00:44:56.889 --> 00:45:00.329  
from where you're standing. It's pulled through,

1074
00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:01.561  
pulled through.

1075
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:05.003  
MARISHA: It's Key West. Sorry, keep going. Sorry.

1076
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:11.160  
MATT: Eventually as it begins to arc downward

1077
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.448  
through the storm coming closer and closer,

1078
00:45:13.448 --> 00:45:16.383  
it flashes forward and you see dark shapes.

1079
00:45:16.383 --> 00:45:21.241  
They look like structures, partial structures,

1080
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:26.241  
parts of what was once a structure that sits low

1081
00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:30.824  
upon the ground beneath the intensity of the storm

1082
00:45:30.824 --> 00:45:34.232  
where there's still wind and sand and dust blowing through,

1083
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:37.843  
but it's not as dangerous as it is up top this tower

1084
00:45:37.843 --> 00:45:39.001  
where you are.

1085
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:39.834
Closer to where

1086
00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:42.301  
when you first arrived.

1087
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:45.542  
There amongst the ruins, you can see there are

1088
00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:49.080  
partially collapsed walls and a marbled floor

1089
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.792  
that is partially broken apart and gaps lie

1090
00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:55.016  
where it seems to have sustained either serious damage

1091
00:45:55.016 --> 00:45:57.896  
or eroded over time, the material itself

1092
00:45:57.896 --> 00:46:01.031  
dark like a jet black metal.

1093
00:46:01.031 --> 00:46:04.740  
Amongst these ruins, you see load-bearing pillars

1094
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.031  
that no longer maintain an upper floor,

1095
00:46:07.031 --> 00:46:09.822  
seemingly blown away, one pillar toppled.

1096
00:46:09.822 --> 00:46:14.822  
You see tucked along the remnants of these walls a desk

1097
00:46:15.047 --> 00:46:18.714  
and some shelves and a bed, and there you see,

1098
00:46:19.655 --> 00:46:24.149  
going through a bag of equipment and cataloging

1099
00:46:24.149 --> 00:46:29.149  
all manner of things that you guys once had on your person--

1100
00:46:30.247 --> 00:46:31.547  
Bob.

1101
00:46:31.547 --> 00:46:32.713
MARISHA: Fucking Bob.

1102
00:46:32.713 --> 00:46:35.655  
With a tiny lantern and a quill just going through

1103
00:46:35.655 --> 00:46:40.655  
with a pair of glasses on his snubbed Githzerai nose

1104
00:46:41.253 --> 00:46:45.453  
and sets them one by one as he's taking notes.

1105
00:46:49.212 --> 00:46:50.379  
You pull back.

1106
00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:53.500  
MARISHA: Fucking Bob.

1107
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.238  
LAURA: It was him?
MARISHA: He's squatting

1108
00:46:55.238 --> 00:46:57.719  
in some ruins cataloging all of our stuff,

1109
00:46:57.719 --> 00:47:01.475  
which makes me think that time is of the essence

1110
00:47:01.475 --> 00:47:04.229  
because maybe he's going to pawn them or something.

1111
00:47:04.229 --> 00:47:06.521  
LAURA: How do you pawn that here?

1112
00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:08.743  
MARISHA: I don't know. I mean, there's people like Bob,

1113
00:47:08.743 --> 00:47:11.998  
so why couldn't there be more people like Bob?

1114
00:47:11.998 --> 00:47:13.783  
ASHLEY: What if he's just like Little Mermaid?

1115
00:47:13.783 --> 00:47:15.143  
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1116
00:47:15.143 --> 00:47:16.710  
ASHLEY: Like he just keeps everything.

1117
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.431  
SAM: Because he wants to be closer to humanity or something.

1118
00:47:19.431 --> 00:47:20.487  
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1119
00:47:20.487 --> 00:47:22.343  
MARISHA: He has a nice little desk and a reading area.

1120
00:47:22.343 --> 00:47:24.543  
It actually looked very cozy.

1121
00:47:24.543 --> 00:47:26.059  
LAURA: What if he doesn't know what

1122
00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:27.409
any of it is actually for?

1123
00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:30.361  
SAM: Let's not worry too much about

1124
00:47:30.361 --> 00:47:32.169
Bob's backstory right now.

1125
00:47:33.789 --> 00:47:37.125  
Your scrying eye, while powerful and amazing,

1126
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:40.551  
can't really pinpoint a location, can it?

1127
00:47:40.551 --> 00:47:41.921  
MARISHA: Um, y-yeah.

1128
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.154  
MATT: I'll say you got a general direction

1129
00:47:44.154 --> 00:47:45.245
from where you are.

1130
00:47:45.245 --> 00:47:46.663  
MARISHA: It's down the mountain back where we came,

1131
00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:49.086  
hang to the left a little bit.

1132
00:47:49.086 --> 00:47:50.752  
TALIESIN: Your other left.

1133
00:47:50.752 --> 00:47:51.710
MARISHA: You're right.

1134
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.215  
I was looking at the other left and then like

1135
00:47:54.215 --> 00:47:56.771  
a collapsed building.
SAM: Okay, so we can find

1136
00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:59.272  
it just from your--
MARISHA: Yes, I think so.

1137
00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:01.869  
LIAM: What are we discussing? How to get home?

1138
00:48:01.869 --> 00:48:04.515  
LAURA: Well, sort of, yes.
ASHLEY: Oh!

1139
00:48:04.515 --> 00:48:06.792  
TALIESIN: Yes, actually, technically, I think so.

1140
00:48:06.792 --> 00:48:08.617  
ASHLEY: You didn't--?

1141
00:48:08.617 --> 00:48:09.575  
LIAM: Hmm?

1142
00:48:09.575 --> 00:48:11.825  
SAM: Your fossil head is gone.

1143
00:48:12.767 --> 00:48:15.511  
LAURA: To be fair, Pike, I probably wouldn't want

1144
00:48:15.511 --> 00:48:17.379  
a fossil in my forehead either.

1145
00:48:17.379 --> 00:48:18.837  
ASHLEY: Well, yeah.
LIAM: I didn't live

1146
00:48:18.837 --> 00:48:21.399  
to be 350 years old without learning a trick or two.

1147
00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.316  
TRAVIS: You're 350 years old?

1148
00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:27.541  
TALIESIN: She just said she didn't live to be 350--

1149
00:48:27.541 --> 00:48:28.743  
LIAM: Don't you think I wear it well?

1150
00:48:28.743 --> 00:48:30.663  
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.
LIAM: Mr. Bell does,

1151
00:48:30.663 --> 00:48:33.670  
don't you, Mr. Bell?
TRAVIS: Yes, it looks

1152
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.759  
marvelous on you. God, I forgot I was even here.

1153
00:48:36.759 --> 00:48:39.175  
(laughter)

1154
00:48:39.175 --> 00:48:41.699  
Apparently, I have an accent all of a sudden.

1155
00:48:43.574 --> 00:48:46.583  
SAM: We were talking about going to get Bob,

1156
00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:48.887  
the fellow that we all met and who robbed from us.

1157
00:48:48.887 --> 00:48:50.343  
Did he rob from you as well?

1158
00:48:50.343 --> 00:48:52.695  
LIAM: Yes, he took something of great value.

1159
00:48:52.695 --> 00:48:57.695  
He took a pinky bone of a man who died a long time ago.

1160
00:48:57.764 --> 00:49:00.359  
SAM: Well, then perhaps you would have a motivation

1161
00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:01.767  
for finding him as well.

1162
00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:03.167  
MARISHA: Who's the man?

1163
00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:04.647  
LIAM: His name was Purvan.

1164
00:49:04.647 --> 00:49:06.716  
(snickering)

1165
00:49:06.716 --> 00:49:09.798  
MARISHA: We know Purvan.
LAURA: That was funny.

1166
00:49:09.798 --> 00:49:11.461  
LIAM: Is it?

1167
00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:12.391  
MARISHA: Yeah.

1168
00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:15.310  
LIAM: Are you trying a find a person, a place?

1169
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.925  
SAM: We've sort of located him through Keyleth's impressive

1170
00:49:19.925 --> 00:49:21.991  
and powerful magic. Why? Do you have a trick

1171
00:49:21.991 --> 00:49:23.108  
up your sleeve that can help?

1172
00:49:23.108 --> 00:49:26.718  
LIAM: Perhaps if you describe it to me I can find the place.

1173
00:49:26.718 --> 00:49:29.042  
I can Find the Path, yes.

1174
00:49:29.042 --> 00:49:30.875  
MARISHA: It's down the mountain towards the way we came,

1175
00:49:30.875 --> 00:49:31.963  
hang a little bit to the left

1176
00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:33.273  
and then you'll find some buildings--

1177
00:49:33.273 --> 00:49:35.739  
TALIESIN: I think what she means is, what did it look like?

1178
00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:37.405  
LIAM: Yes, what it did look like?

1179
00:49:37.405 --> 00:49:39.131  
MARISHA: Building ruins.
LAURA: With a desk

1180
00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:42.338  
and a lantern you said.
MARISHA: Uh huh, and he was

1181
00:49:42.338 --> 00:49:45.594  
cataloging things.
LIAM: And the area around it?

1182
00:49:46.736 --> 00:49:49.444  
MARISHA: The abyssal plains.
LAURA: Ruins. There was ruins.

1183
00:49:49.444 --> 00:49:51.044
I think it was probably windy.

1184
00:49:51.044 --> 00:49:52.955  
MARISHA: Very, very windy. It was actually less windy,

1185
00:49:52.955 --> 00:49:56.214  
because it was set down a little bit.

1186
00:49:56.214 --> 00:49:57.579  
MATT: You describe the details--

1187
00:49:57.579 --> 00:49:59.109  
MARISHA: Yeah, it's what he said.

1188
00:49:59.109 --> 00:50:01.898  
MATT: There's rocky protrusions in the ground around it.

1189
00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:03.611  
You can see part of a secondary floor

1190
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:07.110  
that still manages to linger in place

1191
00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:10.178  
and just bundles of things kept to the side.

1192
00:50:10.178 --> 00:50:13.323  
Boxes, chests, things that this individual Bob

1193
00:50:13.323 --> 00:50:15.027  
seems to be keeping all his things in.

1194
00:50:15.027 --> 00:50:16.243  
LIAM: Yeah, this spell--

1195
00:50:16.243 --> 00:50:18.401
MARISHA: That wafer cracker?

1196
00:50:18.401 --> 00:50:19.584
SAM: It doesn't work?

1197
00:50:19.584 --> 00:50:21.931  
LIAM: I don't think I have the--no, he

1198
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:24.236  
buggered off with things I need.

1199
00:50:24.236 --> 00:50:26.907  
SAM: Well, if there's something that we need,

1200
00:50:26.907 --> 00:50:30.824  
a particular component, I can help us with that.

1201
00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:33.947  
LAURA: How?
TALIESIN: How?

1202
00:50:33.947 --> 00:50:35.435  
SAM: I can make things with my mind.

1203
00:50:35.435 --> 00:50:37.163  
ASHLEY: You can?
LAURA: Are they worth money?

1204
00:50:37.163 --> 00:50:38.851  
TALIESIN: Are they things that actually work?

1205
00:50:38.851 --> 00:50:42.523  
SAM: It's called The Secret. If you think about something--

1206
00:50:42.523 --> 00:50:45.211  
(laughter)

1207
00:50:45.211 --> 00:50:46.761  
<v ->-you just envision it.</v>

1208
00:50:46.761 --> 00:50:49.305
TALIESIN: Oh boy, oh boy.

1209
00:50:49.305 --> 00:50:51.510  
SAM: I can only do it once

1210
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.566  
and I don't want to waste it on an egg.

1211
00:50:53.566 --> 00:50:54.855  
LAURA: We're going to sleep, right?

1212
00:50:54.855 --> 00:50:56.535  
I mean, we're going to sleep before we find Bob.

1213
00:50:56.535 --> 00:50:58.509  
SAM: I could sleep, but I could use this and then sleep.

1214
00:50:58.509 --> 00:51:00.015  
TALIESIN: Oh that's a very good idea.

1215
00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:02.507  
MARISHA: Is it like real though, or is it like

1216
00:51:02.507 --> 00:51:05.307  
your counterfeit furniture that you hawked?

1217
00:51:05.307 --> 00:51:08.187  
SAM: It would be real. I think, yes.

1218
00:51:08.187 --> 00:51:11.176  
Yes, it would be real, but I can make us a component

1219
00:51:11.176 --> 00:51:13.989  
if you need it or I could just--

1220
00:51:13.989 --> 00:51:16.251  
LAURA: So you could just make us a tuning fork

1221
00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:18.554  
and we could go home?
SAM: True.

1222
00:51:18.554 --> 00:51:20.156  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) We need our stuff.

1223
00:51:20.156 --> 00:51:21.630  
SAM: And we need revenge.

1224
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:24.242
LAURA: I understand, and honestly, I don't mind

1225
00:51:24.242 --> 00:51:26.331  
staying here. As soon as we go home,

1226
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:27.698  
we have to deal with the real world.

1227
00:51:27.698 --> 00:51:29.851  
TRAVIS: (as Bell) Actually, this is a really lovely place.

1228
00:51:29.851 --> 00:51:32.268  
What establishment are we in?

1229
00:51:34.059 --> 00:51:38.226  
SAM: This is my home. This is my magnificent mansion.

1230
00:51:39.967 --> 00:51:42.059  
TRAVIS: Quite rich, I must say.

1231
00:51:42.059 --> 00:51:44.698  
SAM: I got it when the market was bottomed out

1232
00:51:44.698 --> 00:51:47.594  
and, you know, it was a good sound investment.

1233
00:51:47.594 --> 00:51:48.427  
TRAVIS: Low interest rate?

1234
00:51:48.427 --> 00:51:51.274  
SAM: Yeah, I locked in 2.7.
TRAVIS: Adjustable or fixed?

1235
00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.758  
SAM: Fixed, bitch.

1236
00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:55.978  
TRAVIS: Well, I am quite impressed.

1237
00:51:55.978 --> 00:51:57.829  
Can we just stay here for--?

1238
00:51:57.829 --> 00:52:01.208  
LIAM: You would never find a deal like that in Vasselheim.

1239
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:03.801  
SAM: Well, it's gentrified.

1240
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:04.778  
TALIESIN: What components would you need for this

1241
00:52:04.778 --> 00:52:06.266  
particulate locate spell?

1242
00:52:06.266 --> 00:52:10.538  
LIAM: I used this to find your friend, but-- because

1243
00:52:10.538 --> 00:52:13.623  
he was in a location you were searching for,

1244
00:52:13.623 --> 00:52:16.647  
but I need something from where this Bob is,

1245
00:52:16.647 --> 00:52:19.730  
which we don't have and I don't think you can make.

1246
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.047  
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: Hmm.

1247
00:52:21.047 --> 00:52:23.045  
MARISHA: I mean, if there's something

1248
00:52:23.045 --> 00:52:25.679  
to get us down the mountain faster.

1249
00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:28.568  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I mean, is that really

1250
00:52:28.568 --> 00:52:30.243
what the big problem is? How we get down?

1251
00:52:30.243 --> 00:52:32.212  
TALIESIN: That's the first problem.

1252
00:52:32.212 --> 00:52:35.050  
TRAVIS: Yeah, so do that.
SAM: Just go down?

1253
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:35.992  
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1254
00:52:35.992 --> 00:52:39.482  
SAM: Through the building or off the side?

1255
00:52:39.482 --> 00:52:42.732  
TRAVIS: Yep, sometimes the simplest answer is

1256
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:47.253  
the shortest point between two ideas.

1257
00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:51.378  
SAM: That's actually pretty good. (laughs)

1258
00:52:51.378 --> 00:52:54.747  
TALIESIN: Almost sensible, but at the same time,

1259
00:52:54.747 --> 00:52:58.074  
we don't have a lot. If we have some spells that we need

1260
00:52:58.074 --> 00:53:00.138  
and you could do this before you go to sleep

1261
00:53:00.138 --> 00:53:02.282  
we should know precisely what spells we need

1262
00:53:02.282 --> 00:53:04.130  
to find our way. We have a general direction

1263
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:08.216  
at this point, so we could just try and home in

1264
00:53:08.216 --> 00:53:11.159  
Locate Object on occasion when we see something

1265
00:53:11.159 --> 00:53:15.988  
on the distance, but it is difficult to see in that terrain.

1266
00:53:15.988 --> 00:53:18.483  
I can get down the side of the tower.

1267
00:53:18.483 --> 00:53:20.202  
I don't know about everybody else though.

1268
00:53:20.202 --> 00:53:22.474  
MATT: I will say so you're aware, Lieve'tel.

1269
00:53:22.474 --> 00:53:24.970  
LIAM: Yes?
MATT: The spell you're trying

1270
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:28.745  
requires an object from the location you wish to find,

1271
00:53:28.745 --> 00:53:31.155  
but you need to have it in your hand, right?

1272
00:53:31.155 --> 00:53:32.430  
LIAM: Which is what I'm saying. It wouldn't work,

1273
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.876
because I don't have anything.

1274
00:53:33.876 --> 00:53:35.242  
LAURA: I have an idea.

1275
00:53:35.242 --> 00:53:38.376  
Why don't you turn us all into something very small?

1276
00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:40.474  
Percival, you put us in your pocket

1277
00:53:40.474 --> 00:53:42.489  
and you walk on down the tower?

1278
00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:44.042  
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

1279
00:53:44.042 --> 00:53:45.298  
Oh shit.

1280
00:53:45.298 --> 00:53:46.656  
TALIESIN: I'm attempting to discover

1281
00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:47.956
whether or not that would work.

1282
00:53:47.956 --> 00:53:49.672
I'm pretty sure it would.

1283
00:53:49.672 --> 00:53:52.205  
TRAVIS: Yo, Vex, up top. Smash hands.

1284
00:53:52.205 --> 00:53:54.346  
TALIESIN: I get about an hour out of the boots, right?

1285
00:53:54.346 --> 00:53:55.683  
MATT: Yeah.

1286
00:53:55.683 --> 00:53:57.898  
MARISHA: Oh, your Spider Climbing Boots?

1287
00:53:57.898 --> 00:53:59.497  
TRAVIS: What if we were all, like, lady bugs?

1288
00:53:59.497 --> 00:54:02.632  
LAURA: You could run.
TALIESIN: Mice will do.

1289
00:54:02.632 --> 00:54:04.324  
TRAVIS: I don't like mice.

1290
00:54:04.324 --> 00:54:05.932  
ASHLEY: Well, we'll be a little stronger.

1291
00:54:05.932 --> 00:54:07.977
LAURA: You could be a weasel, maybe.

1292
00:54:07.977 --> 00:54:09.791  
ASHLEY: Then we wouldn't blow away, just in case.

1293
00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:11.692  
LAURA: Yeah, ladybugs. They could blow away

1294
00:54:11.692 --> 00:54:12.858  
and no one would notice.

1295
00:54:12.858 --> 00:54:14.451  
ASHLEY: Then, if he put us in his pocket,

1296
00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.467  
we could smash.

1297
00:54:15.467 --> 00:54:16.825
MATT: There's no limitation to it,

1298
00:54:16.825 --> 00:54:20.504  
as long as you have the boots on, as long as you want to,

1299
00:54:20.504 --> 00:54:23.212  
climb along surfaces. There's no limitation to the time.

1300
00:54:23.212 --> 00:54:24.070  
TALIESIN: Okay, oh.

1301
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:25.368
LIAM: The boots are endless, aren't they?

1302
00:54:25.368 --> 00:54:26.818  
TALIESIN: I couldn't remember.

1303
00:54:26.818 --> 00:54:28.109  
I thought they had an activation--

1304
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:29.544  
MATT: No, that's Boots of Haste.

1305
00:54:29.544 --> 00:54:30.906  
Yours do not.

1306
00:54:30.906 --> 00:54:32.676  
TALIESIN: All right.
It's been a while.

1307
00:54:32.676 --> 00:54:34.451  
MATT: It's all good.

1308
00:54:34.451 --> 00:54:35.867
LAURA: Let's sleep and do that

1309
00:54:35.867 --> 00:54:37.562  
and then head down.
MARISHA: I don't have to have anything

1310
00:54:37.562 --> 00:54:39.109  
fancy for Animal Shapes?

1311
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.004  
LIAM: That's just druid shit, yo.

1312
00:54:41.004 --> 00:54:44.394  
MARISHA: That's awesome. I could just do that.

1313
00:54:44.394 --> 00:54:45.975  
TALIESIN: How long does Animal Shapes last?

1314
00:54:45.975 --> 00:54:48.603  
MARISHA: Up to 24 hours.
TALIESIN: So if you do it now?

1315
00:54:48.603 --> 00:54:50.939  
MARISHA: It's concentration.

1316
00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:52.746  
LAURA: We should sleep.
TALIESIN: We could do it now, sleep,

1317
00:54:52.746 --> 00:54:54.623  
and then I could just grab everybody else,

1318
00:54:54.623 --> 00:54:56.656  
get us downstairs.
LAURA: I mean, that's lovely.

1319
00:54:56.656 --> 00:54:58.760  
MARISHA: Do we want to use Scanlan's fancy spell

1320
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.143  
to make a chalice so we can have a Heroes' Feast?

1321
00:55:02.143 --> 00:55:04.582  
LAURA: Oh, that's also a very good idea.

1322
00:55:04.582 --> 00:55:06.605  
SAM: We could do that.
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

1323
00:55:06.605 --> 00:55:08.071  
TRAVIS: Let's commit and do it.

1324
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.748  
SAM: Chalice?
TRAVIS: Yep.

1325
00:55:09.748 --> 00:55:10.893  
MARISHA: Cool, we have a plan.

1326
00:55:10.893 --> 00:55:12.739  
ASHLEY: We also could have done that for a diamond

1327
00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:14.607  
so she didn't have to use her wedding ring.

1328
00:55:14.607 --> 00:55:15.860  
LAURA: Motherfucker.
SAM: I was ready to.

1329
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.568  
I was ready to.
LAURA: No, but it's fine.

1330
00:55:17.568 --> 00:55:19.204  
We couldn't use my ring to make a chalice,

1331
00:55:19.204 --> 00:55:20.913  
so there you go.
SAM: There you go.

1332
00:55:20.913 --> 00:55:22.316  
ASHLEY: That's true.

1333
00:55:22.316 --> 00:55:24.561  
SAM: All right, we're going to do some Heroes' Feasting.

1334
00:55:24.561 --> 00:55:28.309  
MARISHA: Yeah. Plus, you get to renew your vows!

1335
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:30.669  
ASHLEY: That's true.
MARISHA: Can I make the cake?

1336
00:55:30.669 --> 00:55:32.502  
TALIESIN: Maybe.
LAURA: Of course.

1337
00:55:32.502 --> 00:55:34.940  
I was thinking the Slayer's Cake.
MARISHA: Slayer's Cake! Yeah!

1338
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.161  
MATT: You're trying to attempt to create--

1339
00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:41.614  
SAM: Let me look. What is this spell?

1340
00:55:41.614 --> 00:55:46.206  
Wrong spell, go back, come on.

1341
00:55:47.765 --> 00:55:50.220  
With the old--
TALIESIN: Okay.

1342
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.073  
SAM: With the old Wish spell.
TALIESIN: How's this Wish spell work?

1343
00:55:54.073 --> 00:55:56.949  
MATT: You can create an object--
SAM: I can make one object

1344
00:55:56.949 --> 00:55:59.578  
up to 25,000 gold pieces in value

1345
00:55:59.578 --> 00:56:00.695  
that isn't magic.

1346
00:56:00.695 --> 00:56:03.265  
MATT: Correct.
SAM: A chalice qualifies, right?

1347
00:56:03.265 --> 00:56:04.098  
MATT: Correct. The gem encrusted-- well,

1348
00:56:04.098 --> 00:56:06.173
it's a bowl, technically--

1349
00:56:06.173 --> 00:56:07.498  
worth at least a thousand gold pieces.

1350
00:56:07.498 --> 00:56:08.607  
You can definitely do that.

1351
00:56:08.607 --> 00:56:11.973  
SAM: I will wish for a chalice

1352
00:56:11.973 --> 00:56:16.426
worth 24,999 gold pieces.

1353
00:56:16.426 --> 00:56:18.419  
MATT: All right, how would you like to wish for this?

1354
00:56:18.419 --> 00:56:20.344  
SAM: How would I like to wish for this?

1355
00:56:20.344 --> 00:56:22.794  
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Oh boy.

1356
00:56:23.851 --> 00:56:26.418  
I will sing a song.

1357
00:56:28.423 --> 00:56:30.873  
I will sing--

1358
00:56:30.873 --> 00:56:31.706
fuck.

1359
00:56:32.866 --> 00:56:36.424

SAM: ♪ If you believe in life after gnome ♪

1365

1366
00:56:58.001 --> 00:56:59.299  
That's it.

1367
00:56:59.299 --> 00:57:02.854  
MATT: Okay, as you visualize in your mind,

1368
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:06.970
the 24,999 gold piece bowl,

1369
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.903
the 24,999 gold piece bowl,

1370
00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:11.647  
you guys watch, apparating within Scanlan's hand,

1371
00:57:11.647 --> 00:57:15.475  
this bowl of solid platinum that is encrusted

1372
00:57:15.475 --> 00:57:17.912  
with diamonds, like jam-packed. We're talking

1373
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:22.685  
like the gaudiest of rhinestone iPad or iPhone covers,

1374
00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:25.015  
just bejeweled all over.

1375
00:57:25.015 --> 00:57:27.282  
It's grotesque.

1376
00:57:27.282 --> 00:57:29.073  
SAM: With a little clockwork piece where if you--

1377
00:57:29.073 --> 00:57:32.064
(click) it can extend to have a little stem to it.

1378
00:57:32.064 --> 00:57:34.248  
MATT: There you go, yeah, yeah.

1379
00:57:34.248 --> 00:57:36.008  
LAURA: Pop me off one of those jewels, Scanlan.

1380
00:57:36.008 --> 00:57:37.472  
LIAM: Like a collapsing retractable cup?

1381
00:57:37.472 --> 00:57:38.631  
SAM: Yeah, it's like a bowl, but then you can

1382
00:57:38.631 --> 00:57:41.391  
make it into a wine glass and then inside

1383
00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:44.041  
are all our faces etched.

1384
00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:45.274
TALIESIN: You got it on Sky Mall.

1385
00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:47.778  
It's a bowl you got on Sky Mall.
SAM: Yeah.

1386
00:57:47.778 --> 00:57:49.670  
LIAM: Can't we just wish for boxed wine?

1387
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:51.553  
LAURA: Seriously.

1388
00:57:51.553 --> 00:57:54.119  
Give me one of those jewels. Pop it out.

1389
00:57:54.119 --> 00:57:58.794  
SAM: Then it would only be worth 24,989.

1390
00:57:58.794 --> 00:58:00.044
Sure.

1391
00:58:00.044 --> 00:58:04.486  
Here you go. Stick it in Lieve'tel's head.

1392
00:58:04.486 --> 00:58:06.228  
All right, let's drink.

1393
00:58:06.228 --> 00:58:09.601  
MATT: All right, so are you guys taking a night's rest?

1394
00:58:09.601 --> 00:58:11.907  
MARISHA: Heroes' Feast and then night's rest.

1395
00:58:11.907 --> 00:58:15.739  
MATT: Okay, so who's casting Heroes' Feast?

1396
00:58:15.739 --> 00:58:16.652  
ASHLEY: I'll cast it.

1397
00:58:16.652 --> 00:58:19.357  
MATT: The feast is summoned, a beautiful spread

1398
00:58:19.357 --> 00:58:22.654  
of divinely crafted and conjured food,

1399
00:58:22.654 --> 00:58:25.166  
much like the spread upon this table,

1400
00:58:25.166 --> 00:58:28.131  
crackers and cinnamon rolls and cheeses and grapes

1401
00:58:28.131 --> 00:58:30.122  
and meats. It's delightful.

1402
00:58:30.122 --> 00:58:32.931
TRAVIS: Give me a grape.
SAM: I want that meat.

1403
00:58:32.931 --> 00:58:36.281  
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: As part of that,

1404
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:39.667  
everyone becomes cured of all diseases and poisons.

1405
00:58:39.667 --> 00:58:40.922  
LAURA: Yay.
MARISHA: Woo.

1406
00:58:40.922 --> 00:58:44.596  
MATT: You're immune to poison and being frightened.

1407
00:58:44.596 --> 00:58:48.161  
You make all wisdom saving throws with advantage

1408
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:49.948  
and, Pike, go ahead and roll 2d10 for everyone

1409
00:58:49.948 --> 00:58:51.306  
to increase their maximum hit points.

1410
00:58:51.306 --> 00:58:54.891  
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
LAURA: Immune to poison and fear?

1411
00:58:54.891 --> 00:58:55.724  
MATT: Correct.

1412
00:58:58.313 --> 00:59:01.111  
SAM: Just wisdom saving throws.
LAURA: No, all saving throws.

1413
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:06.111  
MATT: No, wisdom saving throws.
LAURA: And death saves.

1414
00:59:06.123 --> 00:59:07.867  
LIAM: Death saves, too.
MATT: And death saves. Wait.

1415
00:59:07.867 --> 00:59:08.807
ASHLEY: 12.

1416
00:59:08.807 --> 00:59:09.640
TRAVIS: What is it?

1417
00:59:10.958 --> 00:59:12.996  
LAURA: And we get hit points?

1418
00:59:12.996 --> 00:59:13.829  
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1419
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:15.733
MATT: No, no death saves, just wisdom saves.

1420
00:59:15.733 --> 00:59:17.774  
LAURA: Oh really?
MATT: Yep.

1421
00:59:17.774 --> 00:59:18.607  
LAURA: Okay.

1422
00:59:18.607 --> 00:59:19.440  
LIAM: Beacon of Hope.

1423
00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.231  
We're confusing the chalice with Beacon of Hope.

1424
00:59:21.231 --> 00:59:23.926  
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Damn it. Okay, sorry about that.

1425
00:59:23.926 --> 00:59:24.926  
MATT: It's okay.

1426
00:59:26.926 --> 00:59:29.067
LIAM: Give me that cracker!

1427
00:59:30.451 --> 00:59:32.323  
LAURA: And we add how much to our

1428
00:59:32.323 --> 00:59:33.406  
hit points total?
ASHLEY: Ten total.

1429
00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:34.464
MATT: So ten hit points

1430
00:59:34.464 --> 00:59:36.326  
added to everyone's maximum hit point total

1431
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:38.659  
for the next 24 hours.
LAURA: Woo!

1432
00:59:39.644 --> 00:59:42.060  
SAM: Let's all sleep.

1433
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.733  
LAURA: Wait, are we turning into animals before

1434
00:59:43.733 --> 00:59:46.599  
we go to sleep so that we Keyleth saves a spell?

1435
00:59:46.599 --> 00:59:49.211  
MARISHA: No, it's a concentration spell.

1436
00:59:49.211 --> 00:59:51.544  
TALIESIN: Then no, nevermind.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1437
00:59:54.502 --> 00:59:55.710  
SAM: Pike?

1438
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:56.543  
ASHLEY: Yes.

1439
00:59:56.543 --> 00:59:59.293  
SAM: What-- (clears throat) what room will

1440
00:59:59.293 --> 01:00:04.293  
you be sleeping in t-tonight? In yours?

1441
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.229  
ASHLEY: Well, I was thinking so, but--

1442
01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:10.965  
SAM: Okay, cool. I'll just have them run up

1443
01:00:10.965 --> 01:00:13.890  
some cold water for you.

1444
01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:18.073  
ASHLEY: Thank you. You're sleeping in your room, right?

1445
01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.662  
SAM: Yeah, my double wide, yeah.

1446
01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:20.878  
ASHLEY: Your double wide?

1447
01:00:20.878 --> 01:00:22.628  
Mine's only a twin.

1448
01:00:23.878 --> 01:00:26.655  
SAM: Everyone has a twin bed except for me, yes.

1449
01:00:26.655 --> 01:00:28.358  
ASHLEY: Oh, you have the double wide?

1450
01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:31.880  
SAM: The double wide in the shape of the heart, yes.

1451
01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.360  
ASHLEY: I didn't realize it was in the shape of a heart.

1452
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.509  
SAM: It is. Yes, it is.

1453
01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:39.171  
ASHLEY: Do you sleep like this or

1454
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:40.713  
do you sleep in the middle of it?

1455
01:00:40.713 --> 01:00:43.635  
SAM: I sleep whatever way suits me that night.

1456
01:00:43.635 --> 01:00:44.991  
ASHLEY: All over it?
SAM: All over.

1457
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:49.530  
Sometimes just near it. Sometimes I stand

1458
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:52.246  
in the middle of the bed and just hop up and down a bunch.

1459
01:00:52.246 --> 01:00:53.951  
(laughter)

1460
01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:57.125  
ASHLEY: Can and I come in and just hop on it for a while?

1461
01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:58.002  
SAM: You want to come in with me?

1462
01:00:58.002 --> 01:00:59.441  
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: All right, yes.

1463
01:00:59.441 --> 01:01:02.037  
It's a little tricky because it is a water bed.

1464
01:01:02.037 --> 01:01:03.693  
ASHLEY: Oh.
SAM: It doesn't--doesn't

1465
01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:07.077  
have a lot of bounce to it, but if you time

1466
01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:10.700  
the waves, it'll fling you up.

1467
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.367  
TRAVIS: Sprain your ankle.

1468
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:15.859  
ASHLEY: I'll give it a try.

1469
01:01:17.981 --> 01:01:19.745  
SAM: Yeah. We'll have a jumping on the bed party.

1470
01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:20.578  
MATT: Okay.

1471
01:01:21.497 --> 01:01:23.163  
TALIESIN: Are you jumping on the bed?
SAM: Uh huh.

1472
01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:24.701  
TALIESIN: Question, did you take your armor off

1473
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:26.871  
before getting on the water bed and jump on the bed?

1474
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:28.475  
SAM: Oh no.

1475
01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:30.822  
TALIESIN: I feel as if that's relevant.

1476
01:01:30.822 --> 01:01:31.655  
ASHLEY: I did.

1477
01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:32.655  
TALIESIN: Oh, dammit.

1478
01:01:33.988 --> 01:01:35.654  
MATT: Everyone's gotten comfortable.

1479
01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.571  
LAURA: Come along, Mr. Bell. You're with me.

1480
01:01:37.571 --> 01:01:39.764  
Let me teach you the wisdom of the ages.

1481
01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:42.103  
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

1482
01:01:42.103 --> 01:01:45.360  
TRAVIS: Is that in reference to some sort of meditation--?

1483
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.864  
LIAM: I pull him by the beard to my room.

1484
01:01:46.864 --> 01:01:50.498  
(laughter)

1485
01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:51.857  
LAURA: Some people get frisky when they get brought

1486
01:01:51.857 --> 01:01:54.967  
back to life, you know. It happens.
LIAM: Stiffness.

1487
01:01:54.967 --> 01:01:56.586  
TRAVIS: Minus three to all checks.

1488
01:01:56.586 --> 01:01:59.503  
(laughter)

1489
01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:03.111  
MATT: (southern accent) This is a house of sin.

1490
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.183  
(laughter)

1491
01:02:05.183 --> 01:02:06.339  
Oh my.

1492
01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:09.326  
(laughter)

1493
01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:13.576  
MATT: All right, so as all of you retire to your evening,

1494
01:02:14.973 --> 01:02:18.377  
you guys have a water bed bouncing party.

1495
01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:19.960  
ASHLEY: It's pretty cute.

1496
01:02:20.826 --> 01:02:24.527  
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

1497
01:02:24.527 --> 01:02:26.660  
LAURA: You can say it. I rang his bell. It happened.

1498
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.065  
MATT: There you go.
LAURA: Ooh.

1499
01:02:28.065 --> 01:02:29.486  
SAM: Nice. I like it.

1500
01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:31.951  
TALIESIN: I'm just going to say the kids are gone.

1501
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:34.118  
Just putting it out there.

1502
01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.973  
MARISHA: I slowly back out of the room

1503
01:02:37.973 --> 01:02:40.266  
when Vex makes eye contact with me.

1504
01:02:40.266 --> 01:02:42.779  
(laughter)

1505
01:02:42.779 --> 01:02:46.500  
Sorry, I'm a slow eater. I'm going to go.

1506
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.000  
MATT: And Grog?
TRAVIS: What?

1507
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.126  
MATT: You just sleep on the floor like a dog?

1508
01:02:52.126 --> 01:02:55.144  
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah. Where else would I be, man? Yeah.

1509
01:02:55.144 --> 01:02:56.683  
LAURA: Your little sand training pit?

1510
01:02:56.683 --> 01:02:58.141  
Don't you love it down there?

1511
01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.674  
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! There's a sand pit!

1512
01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:01.365
I go find my favorite spot and

1513
01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:04.256  
I spin twice in a circle and then get--

1514
01:03:04.256 --> 01:03:07.378  
ASHLEY: Aww.
(laughter)

1515
01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:09.152  
TRAVIS: That's comfy.

1516
01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.335
ASHLEY: Buddies.

1517
01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:12.161  
Oh, it's so good to be back.

1518
01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:17.878  
MATT: All right, night's rest comes to you all.

1519
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.461  
You awaken the next morning, fully healed,

1520
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:20.822  
your spells restored,

1521
01:03:20.822 --> 01:03:24.734  
still under the effects of the Heroes' Feast.

1522
01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:29.675  
The day is yours. You all gather in the main central

1523
01:03:31.853 --> 01:03:35.144  
foyer chamber of the Magnificent Mansion,

1524
01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.061  
some well-rested, some not as much.

1525
01:03:39.338 --> 01:03:43.638  
You're now reduced to a minus three penalty to attacks,

1526
01:03:43.638 --> 01:03:45.928  
saving throws, and ability checks.

1527
01:03:45.928 --> 01:03:47.730  
Anything else you guys would like to do before you

1528
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:50.100  
continue with your journey?

1529
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.029  
SAM: Just real quick, we're going to do the mouse thing?

1530
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:55.716  
TALIESIN: I'm going to get us off this tower.

1531
01:03:55.716 --> 01:03:57.985  
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SAM: All right.

1532
01:03:57.985 --> 01:03:59.733  
TALIESIN: Then we'll--
LAURA: I'm going

1533
01:03:59.733 --> 01:04:01.624  
to cast Pass Without a Trace on you, dear,

1534
01:04:01.624 --> 01:04:03.715
before we go. Just right before.

1535
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.364  
TALIESIN: Right.
LAURA: Will that stick

1536
01:04:05.364 --> 01:04:08.507  
if I cast Pass Without a Trace and then turn into a mouse?

1537
01:04:08.507 --> 01:04:10.516  
MATT: Yeah, you're still concentrating on the spell.

1538
01:04:10.516 --> 01:04:11.349  
LAURA: Okay.

1539
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:12.799  
(clears throat)

1540
01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:17.245  
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek out the door

1541
01:04:17.245 --> 01:04:18.667  
to see what it looks like out there.

1542
01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:21.625  
MARISHA: Before we go to--

1543
01:04:26.669 --> 01:04:28.438  
Okay, it's a long journey down.

1544
01:04:28.438 --> 01:04:31.132  
You're going to be pretty much by yourself.

1545
01:04:31.132 --> 01:04:34.622  
Don't fuck this up, okay?

1546
01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:36.325  
TALIESIN: The worst thing I can do is just drop everybody

1547
01:04:36.325 --> 01:04:38.353  
off the side and you'll just turn into humans

1548
01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:40.725  
once you hit the ground and will just be in slight pain.

1549
01:04:40.725 --> 01:04:44.259  
MARISHA: Well, all those hit points will carry over

1550
01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:46.493  
and I imagine the hit points of a mouse

1551
01:04:46.493 --> 01:04:49.584  
are about the same amount as the hit points of a goldfish

1552
01:04:49.584 --> 01:04:53.387  
so I don't want to potentially fuck that up.

1553
01:04:53.387 --> 01:04:55.003  
TALIESIN: Perhaps a bag of sparrows or some such.

1554
01:04:55.003 --> 01:04:55.836
MARISHA: I'm going to...

1555
01:04:57.662 --> 01:05:02.104  
It takes a lot, but just let me--here.

1556
01:05:02.104 --> 01:05:05.932  
And I meditate and I'm going to cast my 9th-level spell

1557
01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:07.986  
and give Percy Foresight.

1558
01:05:07.986 --> 01:05:10.118  
MATT: Oh shit.
SAM: Wow.

1559
01:05:10.118 --> 01:05:11.888  
MARISHA: Which just lasts for eight hours.

1560
01:05:11.888 --> 01:05:15.305  
TALIESIN: Oh, oh oh, brain freeze. Oh god, oh god.

1561
01:05:16.328 --> 01:05:17.989  
LAURA: What did you just do to him?

1562
01:05:17.989 --> 01:05:19.806  
TALIESIN: I don't know.

1563
01:05:19.806 --> 01:05:22.561  
MARISHA: You might feel a little adrenaline rush,

1564
01:05:22.561 --> 01:05:26.718  
little light headed. You can't be surprised,

1565
01:05:26.718 --> 01:05:28.901  
you have an advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks,

1566
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:31.611  
saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage

1567
01:05:31.611 --> 01:05:33.084  
on attack rolls against you.

1568
01:05:33.084 --> 01:05:35.050  
TALIESIN: What?
MATT: For the next 8 hours.

1569
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:37.275  
LAURA: Whoa, that's amazing.
MATT: As Keyleth pulls her

1570
01:05:37.275 --> 01:05:39.911  
fingers away, you look towards her

1571
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:43.004  
and, every moment, you're seeing two moments at once.

1572
01:05:43.004 --> 01:05:44.740  
You're seeing the moment you're in and a moment

1573
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.864  
six seconds ahead of you.

1574
01:05:45.864 --> 01:05:49.435  
TALIESIN: I know everything!
(laughter)

1575
01:05:49.435 --> 01:05:51.210  
MATT: It's a dual reality and, at first, it's really

1576
01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:52.351  
frightening and it takes a moment for you to focus.

1577
01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:53.483  
TALIESIN: I don't even know

1578
01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.140  
how to process what you just did to me,

1579
01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.598  
but I'll figure it out.
MARISHA: You tap into,

1580
01:05:56.598 --> 01:05:59.850  
like, plant magic and there might be multiple timelines.

1581
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:02.085  
TALIESIN: I'm going to tap into the Player's Handbook

1582
01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:03.457  
is what I'm going to tap into.

1583
01:06:03.457 --> 01:06:04.657  
This will be mine for a minute.

1584
01:06:04.657 --> 01:06:05.798  
ASHLEY: I'm going to throw something

1585
01:06:05.798 --> 01:06:07.054  
at the back of his head real quick.

1586
01:06:07.054 --> 01:06:10.721  
MATT: All right, roll an attack at disadvantage.

1587
01:06:13.065 --> 01:06:13.982  
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

1588
01:06:16.237 --> 01:06:17.070  
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike.

1589
01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:18.056  
MATT: Add your strength modifier.

1590
01:06:18.056 --> 01:06:19.593  
ASHLEY: Yep. Uh, six.

1591
01:06:19.593 --> 01:06:22.767  
MATT: Six. What do you throw at him?

1592
01:06:22.767 --> 01:06:23.942  
ASHLEY: A vase.

1593
01:06:23.942 --> 01:06:24.801  
MATT: Okay.

1594
01:06:24.801 --> 01:06:28.257  
TALIESIN: I have intercept anyway so, yeah-- I can, yeah.

1595
01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:29.132  
MATT: You throw the vase

1596
01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:30.704  
and he catches it in his hand.

1597
01:06:30.704 --> 01:06:33.927  
ASHLEY: Dang it, you see everything.

1598
01:06:33.927 --> 01:06:35.315  
He knew it was coming.

1599
01:06:35.315 --> 01:06:37.687  
TRAVIS: Are we attacking Percy now?

1600
01:06:37.687 --> 01:06:39.979  
ASHLEY: No, I was just seeing if his Foresight was working.

1601
01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:40.945
TRAVIS: Fore--?

1602
01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:42.111  
TALIESIN: Brilliant.

1603
01:06:42.111 --> 01:06:43.793  
LAURA: --sight, darling. Fore<i>sight</i>.

1604
01:06:43.793 --> 01:06:45.548  
MARISHA: It gave him--

1605
01:06:45.548 --> 01:06:48.736  
just enhanced his mind's eye.

1606
01:06:48.736 --> 01:06:50.279  
Sorry, did that hurt?

1607
01:06:50.279 --> 01:06:52.908  
TALIESIN: No, it was-- I'm literally letting you do this

1608
01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.249  
because I know it's happening two seconds early.

1609
01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:57.108  
Just making that point.

1610
01:06:57.108 --> 01:06:58.367  
TRAVIS: Let's go!
TALIESIN: Right.

1611
01:06:58.367 --> 01:07:00.909  
LAURA: Wait, sorry, hold on, you've got a thing.

1612
01:07:00.909 --> 01:07:04.134  
Lieve'tel casts Death Ward on Vex.

1613
01:07:06.087 --> 01:07:07.491  
LAURA: What was it?

1614
01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.467  
LIAM: Just a bit of lint.

1615
01:07:09.467 --> 01:07:10.728  
Perfect now.

1616
01:07:10.728 --> 01:07:12.035  
LIAM: You're Death Warded!

1617
01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:13.933  
MATT: Death Warded, do it.

1618
01:07:13.933 --> 01:07:15.425  
TALIESIN: All right.

1619
01:07:15.425 --> 01:07:17.062  
LAURA: Death Ward.

1620
01:07:17.062 --> 01:07:19.161  
TRAVIS: So what are we getting transformed into?

1621
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:20.636  
SAM: We're going to do mice.

1622
01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:23.823  
TALIESIN: Or small sparrows,

1623
01:07:23.823 --> 01:07:25.708  
so that you can't technically fall.

1624
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.044  
TRAVIS: Oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, birdies.

1625
01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.875  
TALIESIN: Some tiny birdies.

1626
01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:31.313  
You'll get flung around a bit,

1627
01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.380  
but at least you can dive down at a speed.

1628
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.984  
MARISHA: Are we all fine with being birds

1629
01:07:36.984 --> 01:07:38.779  
shoved in your pocket?

1630
01:07:38.779 --> 01:07:40.159  
TRAVIS: Raise your hand

1631
01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:41.434  
if you're fine with being a bird.

1632
01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:42.625
LIAM: (coos)

1633
01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.715  
TALIESIN: I mean, just on principle.

1634
01:07:44.715 --> 01:07:46.259  
MARISHA: Okay.

1635
01:07:46.259 --> 01:07:48.225  
<v ->How does Sir Bertrand Bell feel?</v>

1636
01:07:48.225 --> 01:07:49.475  
TRAVIS: (as Bell) Aye!

1637
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:53.551  
MARISHA: I turn us all into Birds Machina.

1638
01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:55.039  
MATT: Except for Percy.

1639
01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:57.619  
MARISHA: Except for Percy, right.

1640
01:07:57.619 --> 01:07:59.154  
LAURA: Oh wait, I cast Pass Without a Trace.

1641
01:07:59.154 --> 01:08:01.189  
MATT: Okay, you cast Pass Without a Trace.

1642
01:08:01.189 --> 01:08:04.248  
Concentrating. You finish the spell.

1643
01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:05.852  
All of you revert into birds.

1644
01:08:05.852 --> 01:08:08.068  
Still inside the mansion, correct?

1645
01:08:08.068 --> 01:08:10.117  
You all flutter around

1646
01:08:10.117 --> 01:08:12.200  
and land across Percy's shoulders.

1647
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.382  
He's got a little small gathering of sparrows.

1648
01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:17.142  
MARISHA: They've all got a little bit different flavors.

1649
01:08:17.142 --> 01:08:19.110  
Scanlan and Pike are love birds.

1650
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:20.880  
LAURA: I got a little turquoise feather.

1651
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.071  
MARISHA: Yeah, you're like the little indigo buntings.

1652
01:08:23.071 --> 01:08:24.388
MATT: You can't talk. You're a bird.

1653
01:08:24.388 --> 01:08:26.440  
I'm a cardinal.

1654
01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.109  
You're a black canary.
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

1655
01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.459  
TALIESIN: I'm putting on my mask--

1656
01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:30.800
MARISHA: Grog's a pigeon.

1657
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.789  
TALIESIN: -- so I can see and not have things blind.

1658
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:34.354  
I'm opening the door to look out.

1659
01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:35.975  
MATT: Okay, you open the door.

1660
01:08:35.975 --> 01:08:37.610  
(wind whistling)

1661
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:40.273  
Wind still blasting by.
TALIESIN: Everything look reasonable?

1662
01:08:40.273 --> 01:08:42.277  
MATT: Make a perception check.

1663
01:08:42.277 --> 01:08:43.477  
TALIESIN: With advantage.

1664
01:08:43.477 --> 01:08:44.733  
MATT: Okay.

1665
01:08:46.366 --> 01:08:48.770  
TALIESIN: Oh that's nice, 23.

1666
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.729  
MATT: Well, actually it would be a single roll.

1667
01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:52.762  
TALIESIN: No, advantage.

1668
01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:54.145  
MATT: Disadvantage because there's no light.

1669
01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:55.534  
You're looking into pure darkness.

1670
01:08:55.534 --> 01:08:56.395  
TALIESIN: Oh, it's pure darkness?
MATT: Yes.

1671
01:08:56.395 --> 01:08:57.435  
LAURA: Shit.

1672
01:08:57.435 --> 01:08:58.768  
SAM: One more roll.

1673
01:09:01.418 --> 01:09:02.534  
TALIESIN: 14.

1674
01:09:02.534 --> 01:09:05.585  
MATT: 14. From what you can ascertain

1675
01:09:05.585 --> 01:09:06.645  
with the little bit of light

1676
01:09:06.645 --> 01:09:08.603  
that's coming out of the mansion door and in front of you,

1677
01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:10.414  
you can still see the front of the tower.

1678
01:09:10.414 --> 01:09:11.622  
It looks the same,

1679
01:09:11.622 --> 01:09:14.554  
but it is pitch black beyond.

1680
01:09:14.554 --> 01:09:17.870  
It is a lightless void space,

1681
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:19.971  
from what you can ascertain.

1682
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:22.810  
You and your arm filled with birds.

1683
01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.211  
TALIESIN: They're all in the pockets.

1684
01:09:25.211 --> 01:09:27.971  
MATT: So you've jammed a bunch of birds in your pockets

1685
01:09:27.971 --> 01:09:31.181  
and you're standing there looking out into darkness.

1686
01:09:31.181 --> 01:09:35.031  
TALIESIN: I am going to just make a bloody break

1687
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:36.189  
for the side of the wall.

1688
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:37.299  
MATT: Okay.

1689
01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:39.504  
LAURA: You can't see anything?

1690
01:09:39.504 --> 01:09:40.652  
TALIESIN: Pretty much not.

1691
01:09:40.652 --> 01:09:41.485  
LAURA: Do you have fire?

1692
01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:43.786
Do you have anything to set on fire?
TALIESIN: I do, actually.

1693
01:09:43.786 --> 01:09:45.086  
What did I used to do for this?

1694
01:09:45.086 --> 01:09:46.971  
I have a thing.
LAURA: You have, like, a lantern.

1695
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:48.725  
Don't you have a lantern with a--

1696
01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:49.930  
MARISHA: Like a directional--

1697
01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:51.054  
LAURA: Yeah, a directional lantern.

1698
01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.395  
TALIESIN: I do.

1699
01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:55.270  
LIAM: It is literally (pigeon cooing).

1700
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.618  
MATT: It's literally birds are in your pocket.

1701
01:09:57.618 --> 01:09:59.437  
TALIESIN: I know, I do have a lantern.

1702
01:09:59.437 --> 01:10:01.504  
So I'm definitely trying to get it--

1703
01:10:01.504 --> 01:10:03.389  
MATT: You bring out the lantern and you go bolting.

1704
01:10:03.389 --> 01:10:04.348  
As soon as you exit,

1705
01:10:04.348 --> 01:10:06.584  
your feet hit the stone floor at the top of the tower,

1706
01:10:06.584 --> 01:10:08.669  
you rush towards the edge where the wall

1707
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:10.895  
that seemed to encompass the peak of the tower

1708
01:10:10.895 --> 01:10:11.728  
had crumbled forward.

1709
01:10:11.728 --> 01:10:14.187  
You step down, your feet touching the stones

1710
01:10:14.187 --> 01:10:15.901  
as you head--
TALIESIN: Full speed.

1711
01:10:15.901 --> 01:10:17.045  
MATT: Full sprint.

1712
01:10:17.045 --> 01:10:19.353  
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and give myself

1713
01:10:19.353 --> 01:10:21.440  
a little bit of unanticipated movement

1714
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.227  
in an attempt to just be difficult to hit.

1715
01:10:23.227 --> 01:10:26.260  
MATT: Right. The Foresight's going to help you on this

1716
01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.558  
because you are running through.

1717
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:32.289  
It's disadvantage on the stealth check

1718
01:10:32.289 --> 01:10:33.446  
but you have advantage because of Foresight

1719
01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:35.249  
so it's a straight roll. Roll a stealth check.

1720
01:10:35.249 --> 01:10:36.582  
LAURA: Plus ten.

1721
01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:39.890  
TALIESIN: That's...

1722
01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:43.306
35.

1723
01:10:44.212 --> 01:10:45.420  
MATT: Okay.

1724
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:49.646  
Very quietly, you go running down the side.

1725
01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:52.129  
Your mask is pushed up into your face as both

1726
01:10:52.129 --> 01:10:54.444  
the blasting of the wind and the force

1727
01:10:54.444 --> 01:10:57.254  
in which you are piercing down the side vertically

1728
01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.671  
of Howler's Crag.

1729
01:10:59.652 --> 01:11:02.012  
You're having to bring one hand up

1730
01:11:02.012 --> 01:11:03.554  
to hold the straps in place

1731
01:11:03.554 --> 01:11:06.017  
so it doesn't end up being carried off.

1732
01:11:06.017 --> 01:11:08.344  
You can see the portions of your mask

1733
01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:13.344  
where the eyes are guarded by glass.

1734
01:11:13.586 --> 01:11:15.722  
The glass begins to (cracking)

1735
01:11:15.722 --> 01:11:16.555  
and crack from the sheer force

1736
01:11:16.555 --> 01:11:18.169  
of sand and dust that's hitting it,

1737
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:19.861  
but it's keeping it. It's keeping.

1738
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.803  
You're rushing down.

1739
01:11:21.803 --> 01:11:25.303  
Make a perception check with advantage.

1740
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:29.575  
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

1741
01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:31.400  
So that's...

1742
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.249
29.

1743
01:11:32.249 --> 01:11:33.988  
MATT: You come to a portion of the shelf

1744
01:11:33.988 --> 01:11:35.763  
where the rocks are very loose.

1745
01:11:35.763 --> 01:11:37.114  
You're running down

1746
01:11:37.114 --> 01:11:38.637  
and right as you're about to leap forward

1747
01:11:38.637 --> 01:11:39.844  
to place your foot at a place

1748
01:11:39.844 --> 01:11:42.703  
where the rock would not be able to sustain your weight

1749
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:44.341  
and send you tumbling over the edge,

1750
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:46.127  
you just dart to the left,

1751
01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:49.463  
and manage to catch a part of natural--

1752
01:11:49.463 --> 01:11:50.773  
sorry, of carved stone

1753
01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.046  
that is jutting out from that side

1754
01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:53.121  
from some sort of structure

1755
01:11:53.121 --> 01:11:55.038  
that either has been absorbed by this tower

1756
01:11:55.038 --> 01:11:56.543  
or once existed there long before.

1757
01:11:56.543 --> 01:11:58.296  
Instead, you use that to kick off

1758
01:11:58.296 --> 01:11:59.668  
and continue piercing downward.

1759
01:11:59.668 --> 01:12:01.834  
You're now about a third down the side of the mountain,

1760
01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:05.785  
hearing all these birds inside your pockets.

1761
01:12:05.785 --> 01:12:07.951  
You guys are all being crushed and knocked around

1762
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:09.492  
and it's not a pleasant experience.

1763
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.367
TRAVIS: (hooting)
MARISHA: (bird call)

1764
01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:13.847  
TALIESIN: Stop trying to help.

1765
01:12:13.847 --> 01:12:16.978  
MARISHA: Look, Dagon has made some weird fucking noises.

1766
01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:17.811  
TALIESIN: Has anything--

1767
01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:20.316  
have I gotten a vibe of anything around?

1768
01:12:20.316 --> 01:12:22.120  
MATT: You do because as you're looking down

1769
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.294  
on one of the little--

1770
01:12:23.294 --> 01:12:24.434  
there's a little outcropping

1771
01:12:24.434 --> 01:12:26.799  
and you can see two howlers

1772
01:12:26.799 --> 01:12:28.971  
that are currently curled up, one of them getting up

1773
01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:32.337  
and looking out and sniffing on the wind.

1774
01:12:32.337 --> 01:12:33.643  
TALIESIN: I'm going to go away from that, then.

1775
01:12:33.643 --> 01:12:35.131  
MATT: Yep, you rolled high enough stealth

1776
01:12:35.131 --> 01:12:36.286  
because you're maintaining your stealth.

1777
01:12:36.286 --> 01:12:38.140  
They don't seem to notice you as you pass by.

1778
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.513  
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep trying--

1779
01:12:39.513 --> 01:12:41.574  
I'm going to try and, not necessarily--

1780
01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:43.207  
now that I've got a movement going,

1781
01:12:43.207 --> 01:12:45.065  
I'm going to try and be more cautious

1782
01:12:45.065 --> 01:12:47.073  
rather than fast at this point. I'm going to keep a good

1783
01:12:47.073 --> 01:12:48.722  
speed, but I'm starting to, like, trade.

1784
01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:49.861  
MATT: Okay.

1785
01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:53.764  
You make your way down two-thirds of the mountain side.

1786
01:12:53.764 --> 01:12:56.931  
Make another perception check, please.

1787
01:13:00.354 --> 01:13:02.461  
TALIESIN: Not quite as well as last time,

1788
01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.586  
but that's okay. That's...

1789
01:13:06.762 --> 01:13:07.595  
28.

1790
01:13:07.595 --> 01:13:08.428  
MATT: 28.

1791
01:13:08.428 --> 01:13:11.620  
As you go rushing down, you leap off one ledge

1792
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.770  
and right as your feet leave

1793
01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:15.307  
or are about to leave the edge

1794
01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.961  
of this cliff face,

1795
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:19.308  
you look and see what is an opening.

1796
01:13:19.308 --> 01:13:22.764  
There is a drop that goes into a chamber inside.

1797
01:13:22.764 --> 01:13:23.624  
You don't see what's in the chamber.

1798
01:13:23.624 --> 01:13:25.294  
It's just pitch black from your vantage point.

1799
01:13:25.294 --> 01:13:27.084  
You only have a directional light.

1800
01:13:27.084 --> 01:13:28.585  
You manage to pull back,

1801
01:13:28.585 --> 01:13:31.394  
not quite peeling the last bit of

1802
01:13:31.394 --> 01:13:32.684  
the ball of your foot off of the stone

1803
01:13:32.684 --> 01:13:34.932  
and pull yourself back in, righting it,

1804
01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:36.520  
curving around the edge,

1805
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.888  
manage to avoid plummeting into whatever chamber was below.

1806
01:13:39.888 --> 01:13:41.204
TRAVIS: Go in.

1807
01:13:41.204 --> 01:13:43.727  
MATT: Fucking Foresight.

1808
01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:46.903  
You dart around and continue piercing down towards the base

1809
01:13:46.903 --> 01:13:51.350  
until, eventually, the fairly vertical decline

1810
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:55.162  
begins to level off into a gradual leveling

1811
01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:56.567  
until eventually--
MARISHA: I can actually

1812
01:13:56.567 --> 01:13:59.200  
use this spell. It's nice.

1813
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.865  
MATT: Until eventually, you reach solid flat ground.

1814
01:14:01.865 --> 01:14:05.040  
You can see the various piercing bits of punched rock

1815
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.486  
that are jutting out of the nearby elements

1816
01:14:07.486 --> 01:14:09.934  
of the crag and the cliffs that surround it.

1817
01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:11.634  
TALIESIN: Is there cover anywhere around here?

1818
01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:12.744  
MATT: There is cover, yeah.

1819
01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:14.304  
TALIESIN: I'm going to run towards cover.

1820
01:14:14.304 --> 01:14:15.987  
MATT: Okay. You dart over towards cover.

1821
01:14:15.987 --> 01:14:18.928  
TALIESIN: I'm letting everyone know we're clear.

1822
01:14:18.928 --> 01:14:22.845  
MATT: Okay, you all get jostled inside the pockets.

1823
01:14:25.217 --> 01:14:26.878  
TALIESIN: We're moving birds from my pocket

1824
01:14:26.878 --> 01:14:28.352  
and placing them on the--

1825
01:14:28.352 --> 01:14:29.707  
behind whatever stone we're covering.

1826
01:14:29.707 --> 01:14:31.096  
MATT: Okay, which bird do you put there first?

1827
01:14:31.096 --> 01:14:32.154  
TALIESIN: Keyleth.

1828
01:14:32.154 --> 01:14:34.370  
MATT: Okay, you set Keyleth there. You set her down.

1829
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.551  
The wind (whoosh) and just takes you.

1830
01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:37.528  
You're a tiny bird in a huge wind.

1831
01:14:37.528 --> 01:14:39.008  
TALIESIN: I attempt catch her.

1832
01:14:39.008 --> 01:14:40.833  
MATT: Attempt to catch her?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1833
01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:43.369  
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check with advantage.

1834
01:14:44.877 --> 01:14:45.710  
LAURA: Oh god.

1835
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:52.887  
TALIESIN: That was terrible, wow.

1836
01:14:52.887 --> 01:14:55.195  
Nine.
LAURA: Oh!

1837
01:14:55.195 --> 01:14:57.368  
MATT: You set Keyleth down and go back to your pocket.

1838
01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:58.764  
She just goes (wind whistling).

1839
01:14:58.764 --> 01:15:00.275  
You try and reach out and just nothing

1840
01:15:00.275 --> 01:15:03.088  
and her bird form, flapping wings out of control,

1841
01:15:03.088 --> 01:15:04.542  
just vanishes into the shadow.

1842
01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:05.535  
MARISHA: What should I do?

1843
01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:07.261  
LAURA and ASHLEY: Drop it.

1844
01:15:07.261 --> 01:15:08.094  
MARISHA: Well--

1845
01:15:08.094 --> 01:15:09.110  
MATT: You're being carried away and buffeted.

1846
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:10.593  
MARISHA: If I drop it, it drops all of us.

1847
01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:11.984  
TRAVIS: Drop the shit. Look, he's rolling dice!

1848
01:15:11.984 --> 01:15:12.960  
MARISHA: I drop it.

1849
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.364  
MATT: Okay, you drop the form,

1850
01:15:14.364 --> 01:15:17.289  
then plummet about ten feet hitting the ground

1851
01:15:17.289 --> 01:15:19.067  
and take five points of bludgeoning damage

1852
01:15:19.067 --> 01:15:23.211  
as you fall, bouncing a bit on the rock.

1853
01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:24.137  
Percy.

1854
01:15:24.137 --> 01:15:25.641  
TALIESIN: My coat is ruined, isn't it?

1855
01:15:25.641 --> 01:15:27.221  
MATT: Your coat is torn asunder

1856
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:29.481  
as the rest of Vox Machina

1857
01:15:29.481 --> 01:15:32.982  
just Alien burst out of the front of the chest,

1858
01:15:32.982 --> 01:15:34.569  
thrusting you back against the stone

1859
01:15:34.569 --> 01:15:36.596  
that you're hiding from.

1860
01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:38.454
SAM: (yelling)
TALIESIN: (shushing)

1861
01:15:38.454 --> 01:15:40.138  
LAURA: I was in his pants pocket,

1862
01:15:40.138 --> 01:15:41.563  
just putting that out there.

1863
01:15:41.563 --> 01:15:42.696  
MATT: The pants are kind of ruined, too.

1864
01:15:42.696 --> 01:15:43.646
LIAM: Canon!

1865
01:15:43.646 --> 01:15:44.711  
MATT: You can still wear them,

1866
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.564  
the waist band is maintained,

1867
01:15:45.564 --> 01:15:48.525  
but you have a giant split along the front.

1868
01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:49.962  
SAM: You're wearing Hulk pants now?

1869
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:50.795  
MATT: Yes.

1870
01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:53.714  
We have Hulk pants Percy with his--

1871
01:15:53.714 --> 01:15:57.409  
three-armed, Hulk pants Percy with his--

1872
01:15:57.409 --> 01:15:58.708  
LIAM: First, it was the butt flap.

1873
01:15:58.708 --> 01:15:59.931  
Now, it is the front flap.

1874
01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:01.648  
TRAVIS: Can't keep those pants on.

1875
01:16:01.648 --> 01:16:04.759  
TALIESIN: No pants Percy, goddamn it.

1876
01:16:04.759 --> 01:16:06.488  
MATT: Eventually, Keyleth walks back,

1877
01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:07.913  
a little battered from the storm.

1878
01:16:07.913 --> 01:16:08.871  
TALIESIN: Sorry.

1879
01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:10.000  
MARISHA: I'm good.

1880
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.554
Just took the air out of me a little bit.

1881
01:16:11.554 --> 01:16:12.493  
TALIESIN: No, it's all right.

1882
01:16:12.493 --> 01:16:14.215  
MARISHA: I think you should lead.

1883
01:16:14.215 --> 01:16:16.946  
SAM: Are we closer, Keyleth? Are we close?

1884
01:16:16.946 --> 01:16:21.459  
MARISHA: Yeah, it's this way...?

1885
01:16:21.459 --> 01:16:24.159  
MATT: Make a perception check

1886
01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.676  
based on the direction of Howler's Crag

1887
01:16:25.676 --> 01:16:27.247  
and where you were.

1888
01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:30.164  
MARISHA: Oh! Fuck, my perception was great.

1889
01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:32.354  
25.

1890
01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.020  
MATT: 25.

1891
01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.870  
MARISHA: No wait, 23.

1892
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.396  
MATT: Based on where Howler's Crag is,

1893
01:16:37.396 --> 01:16:39.613  
based on the direction where you've now exited

1894
01:16:39.613 --> 01:16:41.324  
and Percival, keeping very much in line

1895
01:16:41.324 --> 01:16:44.010  
where you placed or told him since you exited down,

1896
01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:45.520  
and you made your path pretty well,

1897
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.801  
you have a very strong idea

1898
01:16:46.801 --> 01:16:48.459  
of the direction you're supposed to be traveling to,

1899
01:16:48.459 --> 01:16:50.522  
at least get in the ballpark of where your destination.

1900
01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:52.076  
LAURA: Keyleth?
MARISHA: Yeah?

1901
01:16:52.076 --> 01:16:53.932  
LAURA: Can you put up that windshield one more time?

1902
01:16:53.932 --> 01:16:55.559  
MARISHA: Oh yeah!
TALIESIN: Thank you!

1903
01:16:55.559 --> 01:16:57.404  
MATT: With that, the windshield back up.

1904
01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:59.107  
You guys have filtered in.

1905
01:16:59.107 --> 01:17:00.463  
You, for the first time, are really--

1906
01:17:00.463 --> 01:17:01.736  
you got a little bit up there

1907
01:17:01.736 --> 01:17:03.723  
in the tower as well.

1908
01:17:03.723 --> 01:17:05.786  
Wind, sand, whatever. That's weird.

1909
01:17:05.786 --> 01:17:08.447  
TRAVIS: That makes it a lot better. Man!

1910
01:17:08.447 --> 01:17:11.030  
You picked a weird vacation spot.

1911
01:17:12.388 --> 01:17:15.319  
MARISHA: I really need those sock puppets.

1912
01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:17.623  
TALIESIN: It really will help.

1913
01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:19.856  
LIAM: I'm going to pull out the Rod of Alertness

1914
01:17:19.856 --> 01:17:22.270  
and walk towards the front next to Keyleth

1915
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.989  
and lead the way.

1916
01:17:23.989 --> 01:17:26.534  
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: Okay.

1917
01:17:26.534 --> 01:17:28.272  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) I feel like I have a good idea

1918
01:17:28.272 --> 01:17:29.561  
of where we're heading.

1919
01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:30.834  
LAURA: Lead the way, Bertrand.

1920
01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:33.461  
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm a team player.

1921
01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:36.878  
It's time for you to lead, Leyleth.

1922
01:17:39.339 --> 01:17:40.907  
MARISHA: Wow.

1923
01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:43.613  
You know what? He believes in me as a leader, though.

1924
01:17:43.613 --> 01:17:45.399  
I'll take that.

1925
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:47.190  
Yeah.

1926
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:49.765
TRAVIS: I'm in a good mood this morning.

1927
01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.056
LAURA: [inaudible]

1928
01:17:51.056 --> 01:17:52.625
TRAVIS: Yes!

1929
01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:54.395  
LIAM: I'm still going to look for danger.

1930
01:17:54.395 --> 01:17:55.228  
MATT: Hmm?

1931
01:17:55.228 --> 01:17:56.964  
LIAM: Still going to look for danger as we move forward.

1932
01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:59.018  
MATT: Sure, you got it.

1933
01:17:59.018 --> 01:18:00.576
LIAM: With Guidance.

1934
01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:03.736  
Go ahead and make your perception check.

1935
01:18:03.736 --> 01:18:07.123  
LIAM: Which is at advantage because of the rod with Guidance

1936
01:18:07.123 --> 01:18:08.448  
with my negative three.

1937
01:18:08.448 --> 01:18:09.698  
MATT: Yes.

1938
01:18:10.914 --> 01:18:12.912  
LIAM: That was a 19 minus three.

1939
01:18:12.912 --> 01:18:16.279  
Gets me down to 16.

1940
01:18:18.137 --> 01:18:19.542  
Yeah, 16.

1941
01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:21.322  
MATT: 16, okay.

1942
01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:23.527  
Do you guys have a light source currently

1943
01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:24.360  
or are you still going

1944
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.441  
with Percy's lantern?
LIAM: Sorry, 26.

1945
01:18:25.441 --> 01:18:27.395  
MATT: Okay. Do you guys have another light source

1946
01:18:27.395 --> 01:18:29.293  
or are you just still going off of the lantern of Percy's?

1947
01:18:29.293 --> 01:18:32.406  
LIAM: Well, is it safe to, do you think?

1948
01:18:32.406 --> 01:18:33.589  
TALIESIN: Probably not.

1949
01:18:33.589 --> 01:18:36.720  
LAURA: I mean, that's what we did before, right?

1950
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.570  
MATT: No, you had Pike's finger on Light last time.

1951
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:40.661
ASHLEY: Yes, we did.

1952
01:18:40.661 --> 01:18:42.055  
MATT: Your call if you want to keep it.

1953
01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:43.300  
TALIESIN: I'll keep using this

1954
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.871  
for as long as we've got it, then.

1955
01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:46.879  
It's easy to douse and bring back up

1956
01:18:46.879 --> 01:18:48.798
and it's a bit in containment.

1957
01:18:48.798 --> 01:18:50.464  
MATT: Looking ahead, there's nothing immediately

1958
01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:53.468  
that sets off your interior alarms.

1959
01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:57.118  
Make a survival check if you don't mind, Keyleth.

1960
01:18:57.118 --> 01:18:59.750  
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

1961
01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:01.491
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) Ah!

1962
01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.397  
MARISHA: 28.

1963
01:19:05.714 --> 01:19:07.941  
MATT: Okay, great.

1964
01:19:07.941 --> 01:19:11.771  
So a few things.

1965
01:19:11.771 --> 01:19:15.092  
In keeping with the dust and the sand that pushes through

1966
01:19:15.092 --> 01:19:16.797  
and blasting you,

1967
01:19:16.797 --> 01:19:20.516  
you concentrate on your memory of the Scrying spell

1968
01:19:20.516 --> 01:19:22.551  
and the essence of your consciousness

1969
01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:26.060  
being pulled through and remembering that feeling

1970
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.089  
and seeing the little bits of shadows,

1971
01:19:28.089 --> 01:19:31.398  
of masses that seemed to appear

1972
01:19:31.398 --> 01:19:33.281  
and pass you throughout the storm,

1973
01:19:33.281 --> 01:19:36.257  
you begin to recognize some of these shapes

1974
01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:37.844  
and know that you're on the right path.

1975
01:19:37.844 --> 01:19:39.679  
The first hour of traveling does go through,

1976
01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:42.787  
relatively uneventful.

1977
01:19:42.787 --> 01:19:46.276  
You do, however, Lieve'tel and Vex,

1978
01:19:46.276 --> 01:19:47.198  
you will notice this as well

1979
01:19:47.198 --> 01:19:49.497  
because of your passive perception being so high.

1980
01:19:49.497 --> 01:19:50.591  
You swear that you both feel

1981
01:19:50.591 --> 01:19:52.540  
like a rhythmic distant rumble,

1982
01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.873  
like a (rumbling).

1983
01:19:58.939 --> 01:20:00.506  
LAURA: Do you feel that?

1984
01:20:00.506 --> 01:20:01.339  
LIAM: Yes.

1985
01:20:03.203 --> 01:20:06.123  
LAURA: Does it feel like the earth is shaking or something?

1986
01:20:06.123 --> 01:20:08.097  
LIAM: Does it feel like it's coming toward us?

1987
01:20:08.097 --> 01:20:09.505  
MATT: It's hard to tell.

1988
01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:10.778  
It's very faint.

1989
01:20:10.778 --> 01:20:12.620  
LAURA: I put my ear to the ground.

1990
01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.512  
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

1991
01:20:21.227 --> 01:20:22.467  
LAURA: 28.

1992
01:20:22.467 --> 01:20:23.900  
MATT: 28.

1993
01:20:25.469 --> 01:20:27.593  
It's definitely moving,

1994
01:20:27.593 --> 01:20:28.915  
but you don't know if it's coming near

1995
01:20:28.915 --> 01:20:31.223  
or far from you.

1996
01:20:31.223 --> 01:20:33.327  
It just is present.

1997
01:20:33.327 --> 01:20:35.202
TALIESIN: Near!

1998
01:20:35.202 --> 01:20:36.577
Far!

1999
01:20:36.577 --> 01:20:41.431  
LAURA: There's something potentially underground.

2000
01:20:41.431 --> 01:20:42.498  
It's moving around.

2001
01:20:42.498 --> 01:20:45.002  
It's something living.

2002
01:20:45.002 --> 01:20:47.352  
SAM: Well, let us know if it gets closer.

2003
01:20:47.352 --> 01:20:49.133  
MATT: Okay, so you continue to listen

2004
01:20:49.133 --> 01:20:50.991  
or do you keep moving?

2005
01:20:52.979 --> 01:20:57.779  
LAURA: Every 30 feet, I'll just give a little listen.

2006
01:20:57.779 --> 01:20:59.925  
MARISHA: Do we all have Pass Without a Trace on us?

2007
01:20:59.925 --> 01:21:01.782  
LAURA: Yeah.

2008
01:21:01.782 --> 01:21:04.073  
MATT: Pass Without a Trace lasts for?

2009
01:21:04.073 --> 01:21:05.590  
LAURA: An hour.
MATT: An hour.

2010
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:08.734  
So you have to recast it if you want to.

2011
01:21:08.734 --> 01:21:11.755  
LAURA: I can do that. I'll recast it. Sure, why not?

2012
01:21:11.755 --> 01:21:14.817  
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check for me, please.

2013
01:21:14.817 --> 01:21:16.410  
Two for you.

2014
01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:17.660  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Got it.

2015
01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.835
(as Bertrand) You've got it.

2016
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:22.651  
ASHLEY: Piece of shit!

2017
01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:28.522  
LAURA: Wait no, I've got to have my math wrong here.

2018
01:21:28.522 --> 01:21:30.414
TRAVIS: Bertrand rolled an 11--

2019
01:21:30.414 --> 01:21:31.709  
MATT: Plus ten for Pass Without a Trace?

2020
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:36.384  
TRAVIS: 21 and Grog rolled a 31.

2021
01:21:36.384 --> 01:21:37.484  
MATT: All right.

2022
01:21:37.484 --> 01:21:41.034
ASHLEY: Wow. So I rolled a two,

2023
01:21:41.034 --> 01:21:42.076  
but with all of everything,

2024
01:21:42.076 --> 01:21:43.665  
it brought me to 18.

2025
01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.816  
SAM: Wow!
LAURA: Nice.

2026
01:21:45.816 --> 01:21:48.702  
40.

2027
01:21:48.702 --> 01:21:50.168  
TRAVIS: Four zero?

2028
01:21:50.168 --> 01:21:51.043  
LIAM: 22.

2029
01:21:51.043 --> 01:21:51.876  
MARISHA: 24.

2030
01:21:51.876 --> 01:21:52.709  
TALIESIN: 32.

2031
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:54.493  
SAM: Natural 20, 33.

2032
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:56.062
TALIESIN: Woo!
ASHLEY: Dang.

2033
01:21:56.904 --> 01:21:59.073  
MATT: Continuing to move--

2034
01:21:59.073 --> 01:22:02.471  
continuing to move along,

2035
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:05.190  
it doesn't seem to be getting any further from you,

2036
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:08.447  
which means either it's keeping in pace with you

2037
01:22:08.447 --> 01:22:10.035  
or it's just omnipresent.

2038
01:22:10.035 --> 01:22:11.803  
You're unable to really make it out.

2039
01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:14.867  
LAURA: But it feels like it's moving?

2040
01:22:15.725 --> 01:22:17.260  
MATT: I would say because of how high you rolled,

2041
01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.178  
I would say it does feel like it's moving, yes.

2042
01:22:19.178 --> 01:22:23.671  
LAURA: Hmm, weird, this is weird.

2043
01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:24.504  
I don't like it.

2044
01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:26.436  
TALIESIN: If it doesn't seem like it's getting any closer,

2045
01:22:26.436 --> 01:22:28.122  
but it doesn't seem like it's getting any further,

2046
01:22:28.122 --> 01:22:29.792  
but it sounds like it's moving,

2047
01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:32.040  
it means that we're probably being tracked.

2048
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.906  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) It's probably an oasis.

2049
01:22:33.906 --> 01:22:36.269  
LAURA: Or maybe it's just hanging out next to us.

2050
01:22:36.269 --> 01:22:37.685  
TRAVIS: I've heard about these.

2051
01:22:37.685 --> 01:22:38.926
TALIESIN: What is an oasis, Grog?

2052
01:22:38.926 --> 01:22:41.001  
TRAVIS: You look in the distance

2053
01:22:41.001 --> 01:22:43.151  
and there's a beer garden

2054
01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:44.540  
and the closer you get,

2055
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.077  
the beer turns to water

2056
01:22:46.077 --> 01:22:47.483  
and everybody cries.

2057
01:22:47.483 --> 01:22:49.191  
TALIESIN: A beer or a beard?

2058
01:22:49.191 --> 01:22:51.803  
TRAVIS: A beer garden. What did you think I said?

2059
01:22:51.803 --> 01:22:53.469  
TALIESIN: Beer garden?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2060
01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.180  
You've never heard of a beer garden before?

2061
01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.072  
ASHLEY: You get close and everybody cries?

2062
01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:58.643  
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's very sad.

2063
01:22:58.643 --> 01:22:59.783  
ASHLEY: Oh, it's sad?

2064
01:22:59.783 --> 01:23:02.131  
TRAVIS: Yeah, because you're like: "Beer! Ale!

2065
01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:04.953  
"I'm so parched. It's the desert."

2066
01:23:04.953 --> 01:23:08.082  
Then you get there and it's just fucking water.

2067
01:23:08.082 --> 01:23:11.260  
MARISHA: That's not an oasis. That's a mirage.

2068
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.747  
That's what you're thinking of.

2069
01:23:12.747 --> 01:23:14.248  
TRAVIS: Don't confuse yourself, love,

2070
01:23:14.248 --> 01:23:16.733  
these things are very complicated.

2071
01:23:16.733 --> 01:23:18.952  
MARISHA: Yeah.

2072
01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.248  
MATT: As you're having this conversation,

2073
01:23:20.248 --> 01:23:21.706  
I need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw.

2074
01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:22.989
(groaning)

2075
01:23:22.989 --> 01:23:24.097
MARISHA: With advantage!

2076
01:23:24.942 --> 01:23:28.227  
SAM: Oh, Pandemonium.

2077
01:23:28.227 --> 01:23:29.060
TALIESIN: Ew.

2078
01:23:30.063 --> 01:23:31.066  
Even with advantage--

2079
01:23:31.066 --> 01:23:32.662  
Without advantage, it would've been awful.

2080
01:23:32.662 --> 01:23:33.860  
SAM: 16 for me.

2081
01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.612  
MATT: Saving throw, yes.

2082
01:23:35.612 --> 01:23:37.706  
16. Percival?

2083
01:23:37.706 --> 01:23:39.414  
TALIESIN: 11.

2084
01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:41.622  
MATT: Keyleth?
MARISHA: 32.

2085
01:23:41.622 --> 01:23:42.746  
MATT: Lieve'tel?

2086
01:23:42.746 --> 01:23:43.579  
LIAM: 16.

2087
01:23:43.579 --> 01:23:44.706  
LAURA: 18.

2088
01:23:44.706 --> 01:23:46.531  
ASHLEY: 22.

2089
01:23:46.531 --> 01:23:50.114  
TRAVIS: Bertrand rolled...

2090
01:23:50.114 --> 01:23:51.120
a nine

2091
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.879  
and Grog rolled a 15.

2092
01:23:53.879 --> 01:23:54.887  
MATT: All right.

2093
01:23:54.887 --> 01:23:56.709  
SAM: Did Bertrand just die?

2094
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:58.542  
MATT: The maddening winds,

2095
01:23:59.513 --> 01:24:01.453  
the maddening winds of Pandemonium

2096
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:02.693  
continue to buffet you from all sides

2097
01:24:02.693 --> 01:24:04.331  
as you progress towards your destination.

2098
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.802  
All of you manage to keep it at bay

2099
01:24:05.802 --> 01:24:06.860  
except for once again,

2100
01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.360  
Bertrand Bell takes a point of exhaustion.

2101
01:24:11.915 --> 01:24:12.911  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) Not a problem.

2102
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:14.926  
MATT: Adding it to the points you already had, I believe.

2103
01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:16.814  
No, you did lose one from the night of long rest,

2104
01:24:16.814 --> 01:24:18.620  
so you just gain it back.

2105
01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.148
LIAM: Almost a full night. Thank you.

2106
01:24:21.148 --> 01:24:22.526
TALIESIN: Ah!

2107
01:24:22.526 --> 01:24:23.404
LAURA: Ah-ha.

2108
01:24:23.404 --> 01:24:25.190
TALIESIN: (sarcastic laughter)
SAM: Yeah!

2109
01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:27.141  
TRAVIS: One point.
SAM: Fucking!

2110
01:24:27.141 --> 01:24:28.576
TRAVIS: So one point.

2111
01:24:28.576 --> 01:24:30.588  
SAM: Because you be fucking.

2112
01:24:30.588 --> 01:24:32.649  
MATT: Keyleth, could you make another survival check

2113
01:24:32.649 --> 01:24:33.482  
for me, please?

2114
01:24:33.482 --> 01:24:37.131  
MARISHA: Oh boy. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

2115
01:24:37.131 --> 01:24:38.564  
TALIESIN: Oh!

2116
01:24:40.335 --> 01:24:41.563  
MARISHA: 27.

2117
01:24:41.563 --> 01:24:43.893  
MATT: 27. Great.
MARISHA: 15 plus 12.

2118
01:24:43.893 --> 01:24:45.810  
MATT: That's wonderful. All right.

2119
01:24:46.809 --> 01:24:48.390  
Partway into your second hour

2120
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:50.324  
of heading towards your destination,

2121
01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:52.025  
Keyleth leading you forward,

2122
01:24:52.025 --> 01:24:54.524  
you guys begin to see on the outskirts with a bit of light

2123
01:24:54.524 --> 01:24:58.616  
that Percival is pushing forward with his directed lantern.

2124
01:24:58.616 --> 01:25:02.733  
You see branches

2125
01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.585  
and eventually as you stop and pull forward,

2126
01:25:05.585 --> 01:25:07.690  
there is a massive tree

2127
01:25:07.690 --> 01:25:10.195  
here in the middle of Pandemonium's ground.

2128
01:25:10.195 --> 01:25:11.735  
MARISHA: Did I see that when I Scryed?

2129
01:25:11.735 --> 01:25:13.670  
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

2130
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:14.503  
MATT: At least,

2131
01:25:14.503 --> 01:25:16.414  
the shape moved by too fast.
LAURA: Hey, there's a tree.

2132
01:25:16.414 --> 01:25:17.446  
MARISHA: There is.

2133
01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.848  
LAURA: We can Travel Via Plants or something.

2134
01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.391  
MARISHA: Not between planes.

2135
01:25:21.391 --> 01:25:22.349  
LAURA: Shit, never mind.

2136
01:25:22.349 --> 01:25:24.893  
MARISHA: But if we find another tree,

2137
01:25:24.893 --> 01:25:26.799  
we can get back to this one.

2138
01:25:26.799 --> 01:25:29.011  
TALIESIN: We sure that's a tree?

2139
01:25:29.011 --> 01:25:29.937  
MARISHA: I don't know.

2140
01:25:29.937 --> 01:25:31.105  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) What do you mean?

2141
01:25:31.105 --> 01:25:33.969  
TALIESIN: Why would there be a tree in Pandemonium?

2142
01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:37.342  
LAURA: Huh, wait, no, that's stupid.

2143
01:25:37.342 --> 01:25:38.175  
TALIESIN: What?

2144
01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.296  
LAURA: I was just wondering if this was where

2145
01:25:39.296 --> 01:25:40.635  
we fought the wolfy things

2146
01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.385  
because trees grow from shit now--

2147
01:25:42.385 --> 01:25:43.376  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) I'm quite familiar with

2148
01:25:43.376 --> 01:25:46.337
the foliage here in Pandemonium.

2149
01:25:46.337 --> 01:25:50.523  
I can tell you it is just a tree, nothing more.

2150
01:25:50.523 --> 01:25:52.554  
LAURA: What does the tree look like?

2151
01:25:52.554 --> 01:25:54.408  
MATT: It appears to be slightly patinaed,

2152
01:25:54.408 --> 01:25:55.978  
as it was made from iron

2153
01:25:55.978 --> 01:25:56.936  
and then, over time,

2154
01:25:56.936 --> 01:26:00.019  
had gained a teal type of

2155
01:26:00.019 --> 01:26:02.162
slow growth over it.

2156
01:26:02.162 --> 01:26:05.122  
It looks solid and unearthly.

2157
01:26:05.122 --> 01:26:08.460  
It is very large,

2158
01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.148  
probably 50 feet high,

2159
01:26:10.148 --> 01:26:10.981  
from what you can guess

2160
01:26:10.981 --> 01:26:12.120  
from the way it rises up.

2161
01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.116
SAM: That's a normal tree!

2162
01:26:14.116 --> 01:26:16.949  
MATT: You also see amongst its leafless,

2163
01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.660  
its leafless branches,

2164
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:25.077  
a dozen or so ovoid-like

2165
01:26:25.077 --> 01:26:27.522  
black fruit that are attached and hanging

2166
01:26:27.522 --> 01:26:29.955  
from the iron-like branches

2167
01:26:29.955 --> 01:26:32.666  
that look smooth and somewhat shimmering

2168
01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:35.543  
up between the patinaed elements that have gathered.

2169
01:26:35.543 --> 01:26:37.464  
LAURA: How many oval thingies?

2170
01:26:37.464 --> 01:26:38.324  
MATT: About a dozen.

2171
01:26:38.324 --> 01:26:39.580  
LIAM: Holding the rod up.

2172
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.449  
Are those little thingies moving

2173
01:26:41.449 --> 01:26:43.729  
or is the tree moving at all?

2174
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:46.045  
MATT: The tree is occasionally swaying

2175
01:26:46.045 --> 01:26:47.350  
with the wind that is battering it

2176
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:48.931  
but it seems to be holding tightly--

2177
01:26:48.931 --> 01:26:51.550  
TALIESIN: Fruits as well sort of swinging appropriately?

2178
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:52.443  
MATT: Swinging a little bit, yeah.

2179
01:26:52.443 --> 01:26:54.874  
TALIESIN: There's nothing weird about its movement?

2180
01:26:54.874 --> 01:26:55.946  
MATT: Not from what you can tell.

2181
01:26:55.946 --> 01:26:56.920  
Make a perception check if you want to--

2182
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.592  
LAURA: Does the fruit look like it's iron as well?

2183
01:26:59.592 --> 01:27:02.558  
Is the fruit patinaed or does it look organic?

2184
01:27:02.558 --> 01:27:05.331  
MATT: The fruit--

2185
01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:07.075  
if you get a little closer and look towards it,

2186
01:27:07.075 --> 01:27:11.605  
the texture appears to be like hammered metal.

2187
01:27:11.605 --> 01:27:14.438  
They are pitch black, matte.

2188
01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.516  
There is no shine to them like the rest of the tree,

2189
01:27:16.516 --> 01:27:17.757  
but they have divots on them

2190
01:27:17.757 --> 01:27:18.735  
like they're hammered metal,

2191
01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:20.193  
a textured--
TALIESIN: 21.

2192
01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:21.984  
MATT: 21. The movement of the tree

2193
01:27:21.984 --> 01:27:25.407  
seems to be purely based on resisting the wind

2194
01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.973  
and then bouncing back to its original position.

2195
01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:31.840  
There's no autonomic movement,

2196
01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.047  
beyond what the wind is causing.

2197
01:27:34.047 --> 01:27:37.372  
LIAM: Going to use the rod to first cast Detect Evil

2198
01:27:37.372 --> 01:27:41.099  
and then Detect Magic, which it can do limitlessly.

2199
01:27:41.099 --> 01:27:41.932  
MATT: Okay.

2200
01:27:41.932 --> 01:27:44.329  
LAURA: You have a rod that can do all those things?

2201
01:27:44.329 --> 01:27:46.726  
LIAM: I do. It was hard to come by.

2202
01:27:47.623 --> 01:27:48.656
(wave vibrations)

2203
01:27:48.656 --> 01:27:49.676  
MATT: You guys still have Vestiges.

2204
01:27:49.676 --> 01:27:51.343  
That's what she has.

2205
01:27:52.759 --> 01:27:55.609  
The Detect Magic-- there is definitely a magical essence

2206
01:27:55.609 --> 01:27:56.722  
throughout the entire tree

2207
01:27:56.722 --> 01:27:59.437  
and each of the fruit pieces.

2208
01:27:59.437 --> 01:28:01.037  
LIAM: Is it evil?
MATT: Evil?

2209
01:28:01.037 --> 01:28:04.116  
You get no sense of evil from it.

2210
01:28:04.116 --> 01:28:05.650  
TALIESIN: Eatable tree.

2211
01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:07.983  
LAURA: Ooh! Get one of those eggs.

2212
01:28:09.106 --> 01:28:10.378  
SAM: Get one of those eggs?

2213
01:28:10.378 --> 01:28:11.211  
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2214
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:13.106  
Use your hand and get the eggs.

2215
01:28:13.106 --> 01:28:14.245  
TRAVIS: No need for that, please.

2216
01:28:14.245 --> 01:28:18.593  
I am well studied in the removal of such fruit

2217
01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.026  
from a tree of this nature.

2218
01:28:21.026 --> 01:28:23.522  
Please, it would be my great honor.

2219
01:28:23.522 --> 01:28:26.442  
SAM: All right, shimmy on up there.

2220
01:28:26.442 --> 01:28:27.556  
TRAVIS: Now?

2221
01:28:27.556 --> 01:28:28.548  
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Sure, go.

2222
01:28:28.548 --> 01:28:30.549  
TRAVIS: Not on the way back after the deed is done?

2223
01:28:30.549 --> 01:28:33.890  
LAURA: No, right now. It could be useful.

2224
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:36.071  
ASHLEY: Especially since you know the trees

2225
01:28:36.071 --> 01:28:38.909  
and the foliage of this area so well.

2226
01:28:38.909 --> 01:28:42.253  
You might even have an advantage.

2227
01:28:42.253 --> 01:28:46.128  
TRAVIS: Probably. Off I go to the tree.

2228
01:28:46.128 --> 01:28:47.859  
MATT: All right, so Sir Bertrand Bell,

2229
01:28:47.859 --> 01:28:50.323  
You approach the tree.

2230
01:28:50.323 --> 01:28:51.874  
The light source is not shifting,

2231
01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:54.652  
so as you approach, it still is mostly dark and shaded.

2232
01:28:54.652 --> 01:28:56.578  
You can see the wind and the dust

2233
01:28:56.578 --> 01:28:58.143  
just arcing past.

2234
01:28:58.143 --> 01:29:00.787  
You're having to wince your eyes a bit

2235
01:29:00.787 --> 01:29:03.848  
to keep it from blasting into your eyes.

2236
01:29:03.848 --> 01:29:07.140  
Looking up, it's just ominous

2237
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.336  
and the leafless branches

2238
01:29:09.336 --> 01:29:11.469  
scrape against themselves occasionally

2239
01:29:11.469 --> 01:29:14.046  
giving this awful (creaking).
TRAVIS: Don't look at it!

2240
01:29:14.046 --> 01:29:15.252  
TALIESIN: It's so hard for the tree to be ominous

2241
01:29:15.252 --> 01:29:17.605  
entirely by itself.

2242
01:29:17.605 --> 01:29:21.012  
TRAVIS: I take out the Gambler's Blade

2243
01:29:21.012 --> 01:29:24.299  
and I move forward to the nearest piece

2244
01:29:24.299 --> 01:29:26.123  
of low-hanging, dented fruit.

2245
01:29:26.123 --> 01:29:28.482  
MATT: It's about seven feet above you.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

2246
01:29:28.482 --> 01:29:29.931  
MATT: With a leap and a strike,

2247
01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:30.861
you could try and cut it free.

2248
01:29:30.861 --> 01:29:33.491  
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I'm going to try a leap and a strike.

2249
01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:37.324  
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an attack roll.

2250
01:29:40.727 --> 01:29:43.743  
TRAVIS: No, we're great, 17.

2251
01:29:43.743 --> 01:29:46.199  
LAURA: Bertrand can't die. He's a--

2252
01:29:46.199 --> 01:29:51.125  
MATT: You manage to strike once right where the fruit

2253
01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.782  
has about an inch or so of stem

2254
01:29:52.782 --> 01:29:54.334  
that it dangles from the branch.

2255
01:29:54.334 --> 01:29:56.721  
You deftly cut through.

2256
01:29:56.721 --> 01:29:58.438  
It does resist more than you expect it.

2257
01:29:58.438 --> 01:30:00.771  
You've cut thin bits of wood and branch

2258
01:30:00.771 --> 01:30:02.888  
with blades since you were a child.

2259
01:30:02.888 --> 01:30:03.777  
That's half of your pastime.

2260
01:30:03.777 --> 01:30:05.550  
There was a little more resistance to it

2261
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.633  
and a bit of a metallic impact

2262
01:30:07.633 --> 01:30:09.034  
that you weren't expecting.

2263
01:30:09.034 --> 01:30:11.362  
However, the fruit does come loose

2264
01:30:11.362 --> 01:30:13.817  
and begin to fall.

2265
01:30:13.817 --> 01:30:16.566  
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll try and catch it.

2266
01:30:16.566 --> 01:30:18.264  
MATT: All right, roll a strength saving throw--

2267
01:30:18.264 --> 01:30:20.198  
sorry, dexterity save.

2268
01:30:20.198 --> 01:30:21.198  
TRAVIS: Dexterity.

2269
01:30:23.656 --> 01:30:25.688  
MATT: I don't know what's going on over there.

2270
01:30:25.688 --> 01:30:26.521  
TRAVIS: 18.

2271
01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.779  
MATT: 18. You catch it, no issue.

2272
01:30:28.779 --> 01:30:30.381  
It's heavier than you expected.

2273
01:30:30.381 --> 01:30:32.662  
TRAVIS: Or like I expected.

2274
01:30:32.662 --> 01:30:33.574  
MATT: There you go.

2275
01:30:33.574 --> 01:30:34.665  
It's about that large.

2276
01:30:34.665 --> 01:30:35.623  
It's about--

2277
01:30:35.623 --> 01:30:37.078  
TRAVIS: Is it warm, cold?

2278
01:30:37.078 --> 01:30:37.911  
MATT: It's cold.

2279
01:30:37.911 --> 01:30:38.744  
It's cold to the touch.

2280
01:30:38.744 --> 01:30:40.244  
It feels metallic.

2281
01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:44.163  
ASHLEY: Should you try it?

2282
01:30:44.163 --> 01:30:47.621  
TRAVIS: Hold on, I'm ripening the fruit.

2283
01:30:48.706 --> 01:30:50.041  
Does it make any sound?

2284
01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:51.624  
LAURA: Knock on it.

2285
01:30:51.624 --> 01:30:53.791  
MATT: Make a perception check.

2286
01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:57.529  
TRAVIS: Three.

2287
01:30:57.529 --> 01:30:59.184  
MATT: It does not seem to make any sound.

2288
01:30:59.184 --> 01:31:01.475  
It appears to be fairly stiff.

2289
01:31:01.475 --> 01:31:02.696  
TRAVIS: Yep.

2290
01:31:02.696 --> 01:31:04.451  
Well, the deed is done

2291
01:31:04.451 --> 01:31:07.451  
and I'll walk it back over to the group.

2292
01:31:07.451 --> 01:31:08.509  
MATT: Okay, Bertrand Bell returns

2293
01:31:08.509 --> 01:31:09.418  
with one of the fruits

2294
01:31:09.418 --> 01:31:11.202  
of whatever tree this may be.

2295
01:31:11.202 --> 01:31:14.742  
TRAVIS: Oh, much better inside this wind wall you're making.

2296
01:31:14.742 --> 01:31:15.651  
Very impressive.

2297
01:31:15.651 --> 01:31:17.234  
Fruit, as promised.

2298
01:31:18.082 --> 01:31:19.983  
Remember to leave it in my Yelp review.

2299
01:31:19.983 --> 01:31:21.724  
LAURA: Knock, knock, knock, knock.

2300
01:31:21.724 --> 01:31:22.566
Does it make a metal sound?

2301
01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:24.183  
MATT: It doesn't make a metal sound.

2302
01:31:24.183 --> 01:31:26.632  
It just makes a very hard shell sound.

2303
01:31:26.632 --> 01:31:30.558  
It sounds like you're hitting hard wood.

2304
01:31:30.558 --> 01:31:31.937  
LAURA: (knocking) It sounds like that?

2305
01:31:31.937 --> 01:31:34.482  
MATT: Kind of, but solid and thick.

2306
01:31:34.482 --> 01:31:36.550  
TRAVIS: Is it a solid piece

2307
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:39.392  
or are there any seams, organic or otherwise?

2308
01:31:39.392 --> 01:31:41.635  
MATT: No seams.

2309
01:31:41.635 --> 01:31:42.468  
ASHLEY: Hello?

2310
01:31:43.768 --> 01:31:44.703  
LAURA: Lick it.

2311
01:31:44.703 --> 01:31:46.235  
SAM: Shall we smash it on the ground?

2312
01:31:46.235 --> 01:31:47.068  
LAURA: Somebody lick it.

2313
01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:47.901
SAM: We're not going to lick it.

2314
01:31:47.901 --> 01:31:48.734  
TRAVIS: What do you mean lick it?

2315
01:31:48.734 --> 01:31:50.569
LAURA: Lick the fruit.

2316
01:31:50.569 --> 01:31:54.162  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I'll grab it (slurps).

2317
01:31:54.162 --> 01:31:55.101  
MATT: Very dusty.

2318
01:31:55.101 --> 01:31:57.730  
Your tongue is just caked in the sands

2319
01:31:57.730 --> 01:32:00.309  
and dust that rock it and buffet

2320
01:32:00.309 --> 01:32:01.524  
this side of Pandemonium.

2321
01:32:01.524 --> 01:32:03.941  
TRAVIS: It's not a flavorful fruit.

2322
01:32:04.806 --> 01:32:06.195  
SAM: Smash it. Just smash it, Grog.

2323
01:32:06.195 --> 01:32:07.773  
Smash it with your ax or your hammer

2324
01:32:07.773 --> 01:32:09.450  
or your hands.

2325
01:32:09.450 --> 01:32:10.867  
TRAVIS: Fuck you, fruit.

2326
01:32:13.554 --> 01:32:17.487  
MATT: As Grog slams the fruit onto the ground,

2327
01:32:17.487 --> 01:32:19.512  
the hard stone floor,

2328
01:32:19.512 --> 01:32:23.257  
it cracks open into four separate pieces.

2329
01:32:23.257 --> 01:32:24.826  
For the hard exterior of it,

2330
01:32:24.826 --> 01:32:28.746  
the inside is a deep, deep crimson fleshy fruit,

2331
01:32:28.746 --> 01:32:32.325  
like a bright, watermelon-esque but thicker

2332
01:32:32.325 --> 01:32:34.295  
and slightly striated.

2333
01:32:34.295 --> 01:32:36.888  
It doesn't look pleasant.

2334
01:32:36.888 --> 01:32:38.921  
It kind of resembles meat,

2335
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:41.671  
which is off putting for a fruit.

2336
01:32:43.043 --> 01:32:44.395  
It's wet,

2337
01:32:44.395 --> 01:32:46.578  
but not a large amount of juice

2338
01:32:46.578 --> 01:32:47.998  
is expelled upon it cracking.

2339
01:32:47.998 --> 01:32:49.025  
LAURA: Does it smell like meat?

2340
01:32:49.025 --> 01:32:50.231  
MATT: Do you want to go ahead and smell it?

2341
01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.248  
TRAVIS: Is it, like, bloody?

2342
01:32:52.248 --> 01:32:53.751  
MATT: It has an iron-like smell to it.

2343
01:32:53.751 --> 01:32:55.836  
LAURA: Oh my god, what if this was souls?

2344
01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.109  
What if this was somebody's soul?

2345
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:58.151  
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

2346
01:32:58.151 --> 01:33:01.043  
SAM: It's probably a body, not soul. It's blood.

2347
01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:03.151  
TALIESIN: Or it's something that's going to attract

2348
01:33:03.151 --> 01:33:05.167  
whatever it as that was making the vibration noise.

2349
01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:07.309  
Are we still hearing that thing?

2350
01:33:07.309 --> 01:33:08.755  
MATT: Make a perception check.

2351
01:33:08.755 --> 01:33:11.374  
LAURA: Oh no, with advantage?

2352
01:33:11.374 --> 01:33:13.606  
I can't remember why I had advantage to begin with.

2353
01:33:13.606 --> 01:33:14.439  
No?

2354
01:33:14.439 --> 01:33:15.356  
Okay, cool.

2355
01:33:18.389 --> 01:33:19.639  
Perception, 27.

2356
01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.153  
MARISHA: Ooh.

2357
01:33:22.153 --> 01:33:27.098  
(slow rumbling steps)

2358
01:33:27.098 --> 01:33:27.931  
LAURA: Does that mean it's getting closer?

2359
01:33:27.931 --> 01:33:29.776  
MATT: It's getting every so faintly louder.

2360
01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:31.231  
LAURA: It's getting louder, it's getting louder,

2361
01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:32.256  
it's getting louder. It's coming.

2362
01:33:32.256 --> 01:33:35.478  
TRAVIS: Maybe we leave this here and move. Now.

2363
01:33:35.478 --> 01:33:36.803  
LAURA: Yeah.

2364
01:33:36.803 --> 01:33:39.453  
I grab a little chunk of it, though.

2365
01:33:39.453 --> 01:33:40.329  
TRAVIS: Why?

2366
01:33:40.329 --> 01:33:42.093  
LAURA: I just want to know what it is. Should I touch it?

2367
01:33:42.093 --> 01:33:42.926  
Should I touch it?

2368
01:33:42.926 --> 01:33:43.759  
Maybe I shouldn't touch it.

2369
01:33:43.759 --> 01:33:44.717  
SAM: Touch it.

2370
01:33:44.717 --> 01:33:45.550  
Touch the meat.

2371
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:46.574  
Resistance.

2372
01:33:46.574 --> 01:33:47.491  
LAURA: I touch it.

2373
01:33:48.529 --> 01:33:50.582  
MATT: It's kind of fleshy.

2374
01:33:50.582 --> 01:33:52.609  
It feels like a very fleshy fruit.

2375
01:33:52.609 --> 01:33:53.442  
LAURA: I take it

2376
01:33:53.442 --> 01:33:55.132  
and put it in the Bag of Colding. Okay, let's go.

2377
01:33:55.132 --> 01:33:55.979  
MATT: Okay.

2378
01:33:56.821 --> 01:33:58.735  
MARISHA: Let's pick up pace, yeah?

2379
01:33:58.735 --> 01:34:01.023  
MATT: Okay, so new stealth checks from everybody.

2380
01:34:01.023 --> 01:34:03.056  
You have to cast Pass Without a Trace again, if you'd like.

2381
01:34:03.056 --> 01:34:04.664
MARISHA: I can do it if you--

2382
01:34:04.664 --> 01:34:08.314  
LAURA: It's my, oh yes, I'm out of second levels.

2383
01:34:09.689 --> 01:34:10.522
LIAM: Guidance.

2384
01:34:12.053 --> 01:34:14.740  
MARISHA: Pass Without a Trace from me.

2385
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.317  
SAM: We get Pass Without?

2386
01:34:17.317 --> 01:34:18.299  
15.

2387
01:34:18.299 --> 01:34:19.549  
TALIESIN: Whoa, really?

2388
01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:22.100  
26.

2389
01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.200  
MARISHA: 30.

2390
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.150  
LIAM: 23.

2391
01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:27.199  
LAURA: 39.

2392
01:34:27.199 --> 01:34:28.776  
ASHLEY: 30.

2393
01:34:28.776 --> 01:34:31.509  
TRAVIS: Bertrand rolled a 36.

2394
01:34:31.509 --> 01:34:33.542  
Grog rolled a one.

2395
01:34:34.616 --> 01:34:36.032  
MATT: A natural one?

2396
01:34:36.032 --> 01:34:38.090  
LIAM: Bye bye, you guys!

2397
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:39.345  
MATT: That's okay.

2398
01:34:39.345 --> 01:34:43.178  
As you guys crest on forward into the storm

2399
01:34:44.157 --> 01:34:46.123  
in the direction of which Keyleth is running,

2400
01:34:46.123 --> 01:34:47.789  
with the new Pass Without a Trace, I'm going to need

2401
01:34:47.789 --> 01:34:49.867  
everyone also make another wisdom saving throw

2402
01:34:49.867 --> 01:34:51.231  
with advantage.

2403
01:34:52.398 --> 01:34:53.231  
TRAVIS: With advantage?

2404
01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:54.587  
LAURA: Oh, that was the advantage I was thinking of.

2405
01:34:54.587 --> 01:34:56.386  
MATT: Yeah, because of the Heroes' Feast.

2406
01:34:56.386 --> 01:34:57.464  
SAM: 16 again.

2407
01:34:57.464 --> 01:34:59.358  
MARISHA: Oh goodness, thank god. I rolled a one.

2408
01:35:01.075 --> 01:35:02.033  
TALIESIN: 22.

2409
01:35:02.033 --> 01:35:03.441  
MARISHA: 28.

2410
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:04.274  
LIAM: Oof.

2411
01:35:06.302 --> 01:35:07.764  
It's 15 for me.

2412
01:35:07.764 --> 01:35:09.181  
MATT: All right. Vex?

2413
01:35:10.828 --> 01:35:11.964  
LAURA: 19.

2414
01:35:11.964 --> 01:35:12.797  
MATT: All right.

2415
01:35:12.797 --> 01:35:13.630  
ASHLEY: 25.

2416
01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.849  
TRAVIS: (muffled) 17 for Bertrand Bell

2417
01:35:15.849 --> 01:35:18.660  
and seven,

2418
01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.818  
no-- seven for Grog.

2419
01:35:21.818 --> 01:35:23.091  
MATT: All right.

2420
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:23.924  
As the maddening winds

2421
01:35:23.924 --> 01:35:26.554  
now start taking their toll on Grog,

2422
01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.033  
new to this experience

2423
01:35:28.033 --> 01:35:30.084  
of Pandemonium, beginning to be worn down

2424
01:35:30.084 --> 01:35:31.440  
by the incessant howl

2425
01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.893  
that grinds its way

2426
01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:35.339  
into his ears and his eyes and his senses,

2427
01:35:35.339 --> 01:35:37.197  
Grog takes a point of exhaustion.

2428
01:35:38.939 --> 01:35:41.047  
TRAVIS: That's a nine. Still.

2429
01:35:41.047 --> 01:35:42.047  
MATT: All right.

2430
01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.849  
TRAVIS: It was actually a nine.

2431
01:35:44.849 --> 01:35:45.725  
That still fails, right?

2432
01:35:45.725 --> 01:35:46.558  
MATT: Nine still fails.

2433
01:35:46.558 --> 01:35:47.391  
DC is ten.

2434
01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:53.760  
TRAVIS: I can't see the dot sometimes, but it's there.

2435
01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.593  
MATT: All right.

2436
01:35:54.593 --> 01:35:55.908  
Could you make another nature check,

2437
01:35:55.908 --> 01:35:56.984  
Keyleth, as you're leading the group?

2438
01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:57.927  
MARISHA: Nature or survival?

2439
01:35:57.927 --> 01:36:00.260  
MATT: Sorry, survival, thank you.

2440
01:36:01.967 --> 01:36:03.232  
MARISHA: 25.

2441
01:36:03.232 --> 01:36:04.223  
MATT: 25, great.

2442
01:36:04.223 --> 01:36:05.710  
Continuing into the third hour

2443
01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:07.409  
of this journey towards your destination,

2444
01:36:07.409 --> 01:36:11.533  
keeping tabs that heavy sound you're listening for

2445
01:36:11.533 --> 01:36:13.319  
as you, every now and then, take a moment to stop.

2446
01:36:13.319 --> 01:36:14.824  
It seems to be keeping in pace with your movement.

2447
01:36:14.824 --> 01:36:16.209  
So it's not getting closer--

2448
01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:18.263  
MARISHA: But it's following us?

2449
01:36:18.263 --> 01:36:20.173  
MATT: It seems to be maintaining

2450
01:36:20.173 --> 01:36:21.669  
its pursuit.
LAURA: What the shit

2451
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:22.661  
is this thing?

2452
01:36:22.661 --> 01:36:24.635  
TRAVIS: You had to put it in the bag.

2453
01:36:24.635 --> 01:36:27.851  
LAURA: It was already following us.

2454
01:36:27.851 --> 01:36:31.654  
MATT: You see something that you briefly saw in your vision,

2455
01:36:31.654 --> 01:36:33.009  
which tells you that you're still on the right track

2456
01:36:33.009 --> 01:36:34.275  
and keeps you oriented.

2457
01:36:34.275 --> 01:36:36.349  
As you pointed out,

2458
01:36:36.349 --> 01:36:40.806  
you guys see a partially-buried statue.

2459
01:36:40.806 --> 01:36:44.384  
12 feet tall, with as much of it is exposed,

2460
01:36:44.384 --> 01:36:49.384  
it's probably much taller. Close to 25 to 30 feet total.

2461
01:36:49.509 --> 01:36:50.342  
From what you can see,

2462
01:36:50.342 --> 01:36:54.487  
it's about 12 to 15 feet of it exposed at an angle.

2463
01:36:54.487 --> 01:36:56.198  
It's sand blasted,

2464
01:36:56.198 --> 01:37:00.577  
but still maintains most of its form without issue.

2465
01:37:00.577 --> 01:37:04.159  
It appears to be made of hard metal.

2466
01:37:04.159 --> 01:37:07.298  
The body is that of a rogue female.

2467
01:37:07.298 --> 01:37:11.516  
Her head is wreathed like a lion in blades,

2468
01:37:11.516 --> 01:37:16.516  
just swords coming out like a jagged sunflower

2469
01:37:17.555 --> 01:37:21.006  
with some of them forming a subtle crown upon her brow

2470
01:37:21.006 --> 01:37:23.006  
before emitting outward.

2471
01:37:25.958 --> 01:37:28.360  
TALIESIN: Does that look familiar at all?

2472
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.642  
MATT: You can make an arcana check.

2473
01:37:30.642 --> 01:37:31.604  
SAM: May I as well?

2474
01:37:31.604 --> 01:37:32.437  
MATT: You may.

2475
01:37:32.437 --> 01:37:33.787
TRAVIS: 350 roll checks.

2476
01:37:33.787 --> 01:37:34.966  
SAM: One.

2477
01:37:34.966 --> 01:37:37.093  
TALIESIN: Arcana or history?

2478
01:37:37.093 --> 01:37:39.193  
MATT: This would be arcana.

2479
01:37:39.193 --> 01:37:40.350  
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine.

2480
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:42.267  
TRAVIS: Any idea who that is?

2481
01:37:43.267 --> 01:37:44.103  
TALIESIN: 18.

2482
01:37:44.103 --> 01:37:44.980  
MATT: 18.

2483
01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.253  
Anybody else with arcana?

2484
01:37:46.253 --> 01:37:48.086  
LIAM: Yes, yes I will.

2485
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.113
TRAVIS: Yeah, you.

2486
01:37:50.113 --> 01:37:53.031  
LIAM: Guidance, which just cancels out my exhaustion.

2487
01:37:53.031 --> 01:37:54.470  
MATT: You have advantage on that as well, Percy.

2488
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:55.303  
SAM: He did.

2489
01:37:56.345 --> 01:37:57.795
LIAM: Ooh, terrible.

2490
01:38:00.402 --> 01:38:02.402  
No, it's balls totals.

2491
01:38:02.402 --> 01:38:04.406  
I just rolled balls,

2492
01:38:04.406 --> 01:38:06.159  
but I would like to use the rod

2493
01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:08.705  
to Detect Magic, Detect Evil.

2494
01:38:08.705 --> 01:38:10.623  
LAURA: It's not total balls.

2495
01:38:10.623 --> 01:38:11.615  
LIAM: It's pretty balls.

2496
01:38:11.615 --> 01:38:14.095  
It's minus three, so that's down to two

2497
01:38:14.095 --> 01:38:14.928  
plus four is six.

2498
01:38:14.928 --> 01:38:15.761  
LAURA: Plus eight.

2499
01:38:15.761 --> 01:38:16.719  
LIAM: So it's 14.

2500
01:38:16.719 --> 01:38:18.427  
That's balls.

2501
01:38:18.427 --> 01:38:19.633  
LAURA: Total balls.

2502
01:38:19.633 --> 01:38:22.673  
MATT: None of you are able to recognize the iconography

2503
01:38:22.673 --> 01:38:24.560  
of this statue,

2504
01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.494  
where it hails from, what it means,

2505
01:38:26.494 --> 01:38:28.744  
what this female figure is.

2506
01:38:31.366 --> 01:38:32.949  
ASHLEY: Bertrand.

2507
01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:35.552  
TRAVIS: Yes, my love, how may I assist?

2508
01:38:35.552 --> 01:38:36.843  
ASHLEY: Does she look familiar to you?

2509
01:38:36.843 --> 01:38:40.602  
TRAVIS: Ah yes, the blade queen.

2510
01:38:42.592 --> 01:38:44.425  
Storied female figure.

2511
01:38:45.388 --> 01:38:46.700  
SAM: What were the stories?

2512
01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:49.724  
TRAVIS: They are too long for the time we have, my friend.

2513
01:38:49.724 --> 01:38:52.391  
I'm sorry, we are on a schedule.

2514
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.800  
SAM: Blade queen, eh?

2515
01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.258  
TRAVIS: Yes.

2516
01:38:56.258 --> 01:38:59.628  
SAM: A positive figure of good or...?

2517
01:38:59.628 --> 01:39:03.000  
TRAVIS: She has blades around her head.

2518
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.431  
Do you think that's positive?

2519
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:07.679  
SAM: It depends, depends.

2520
01:39:07.679 --> 01:39:10.262  
TRAVIS: My friend, that's a negatory.

2521
01:39:11.343 --> 01:39:12.343  
SAM: All right.

2522
01:39:13.301 --> 01:39:16.293  
But if someone was throwing a bunch of envelopes at her

2523
01:39:16.293 --> 01:39:17.614  
and she needed to open them all,

2524
01:39:17.614 --> 01:39:20.046  
she'd just have to do her taxes or something.

2525
01:39:20.046 --> 01:39:21.812  
TRAVIS: That is a preposterous situation.

2526
01:39:21.812 --> 01:39:22.791  
SAM: All right, you're right.

2527
01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:24.290  
I'm just shitting on you.

2528
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:27.246  
MATT: Lieve'tel, while they're having this conversation,

2529
01:39:27.246 --> 01:39:29.123  
the statue is not magical

2530
01:39:29.123 --> 01:39:31.893  
nor is there an evil presence from it.

2531
01:39:31.893 --> 01:39:34.476  
You're just unable to ascertain

2532
01:39:35.677 --> 01:39:40.643  
the nature and significance of it.

2533
01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.104  
MARISHA: Cool.

2534
01:39:47.104 --> 01:39:48.687  
Keep going?

2535
01:39:48.687 --> 01:39:51.510  
TALIESIN: Are there any other landmarks as we walk past?

2536
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:53.845  
MATT: Right now around you, it's just a singular statue

2537
01:39:53.845 --> 01:39:56.165  
sitting out of the sand at an odd angle.

2538
01:39:56.165 --> 01:39:57.615  
ASHLEY: I'm going to give it a check, too.

2539
01:39:58.665 --> 01:39:59.498
Nope.

2540
01:40:00.714 --> 01:40:02.802  
SAM: Can we feel around it for traps or anything?

2541
01:40:02.802 --> 01:40:04.093  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Well, let's go see what

2542
01:40:04.093 --> 01:40:05.528
it's made out of, at least.

2543
01:40:05.528 --> 01:40:07.111  
It's pretty unique.

2544
01:40:08.862 --> 01:40:09.820  
SAM: Keyleth,

2545
01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:13.201  
are we going the right way still?

2546
01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:14.656  
Is it past the statue?

2547
01:40:14.656 --> 01:40:16.723  
MARISHA: Uh-huh, it's just beyond this,

2548
01:40:16.723 --> 01:40:18.140  
kind of saw this.

2549
01:40:18.996 --> 01:40:20.839  
TALIESIN: Can I identify the type of metal

2550
01:40:20.839 --> 01:40:23.832  
based off of the coloration of the rust?

2551
01:40:23.832 --> 01:40:24.890  
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2552
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.657  
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2553
01:40:26.657 --> 01:40:27.668  
MARISHA: It is kind of nice

2554
01:40:27.668 --> 01:40:29.767  
that we're getting in a little bit of sightseeing

2555
01:40:29.767 --> 01:40:30.729  
on this journey.

2556
01:40:30.729 --> 01:40:32.076  
SAM: That's true, that's true. Normally when

2557
01:40:32.076 --> 01:40:32.909  
we go to a place--
TALIESIN: 18.

2558
01:40:32.909 --> 01:40:35.540  
SAM: -- we just do our job and then leave.

2559
01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:36.482  
TALIESIN: What does that mean?

2560
01:40:36.482 --> 01:40:37.649  
LAURA: Plus four.

2561
01:40:37.649 --> 01:40:38.815
LIAM: Plus 1d4.

2562
01:40:38.815 --> 01:40:39.898  
TALIESIN: Oh, plus 1d4.

2563
01:40:41.277 --> 01:40:42.153  
I'll count it.

2564
01:40:42.153 --> 01:40:44.803  
LAURA: No, that shouldn't count. Reroll it.

2565
01:40:44.803 --> 01:40:45.807  
TALIESIN: 21.

2566
01:40:45.807 --> 01:40:46.825  
MATT: Okay.

2567
01:40:46.825 --> 01:40:49.437  
It appears to be a steel alloy.

2568
01:40:49.437 --> 01:40:51.428  
TALIESIN: It's a steel alloy of some sort.

2569
01:40:51.428 --> 01:40:53.503  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) Ah yes.

2570
01:40:53.503 --> 01:40:57.658  
Common amongst these lands in ancient times.

2571
01:40:57.658 --> 01:40:59.447  
LAURA: Does it look like it's been

2572
01:40:59.447 --> 01:41:01.398  
here for a very long time?

2573
01:41:01.398 --> 01:41:04.820  
Does it look like its been hit with the wind?

2574
01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:07.670  
MATT: It looks like it's been here for some time.

2575
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:10.051  
It's not a recent discovery.

2576
01:41:10.051 --> 01:41:13.466  
The weathering and elements of erosion

2577
01:41:13.466 --> 01:41:16.691  
that are visible on something made of solid steel

2578
01:41:16.691 --> 01:41:18.804  
tells you that it's been here for quite some time.

2579
01:41:18.804 --> 01:41:20.097  
TALIESIN: An appropriate material

2580
01:41:20.097 --> 01:41:23.007  
of a civilization that had perfected the art of swordmaking

2581
01:41:23.007 --> 01:41:25.090  
in the first place.

2582
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:29.071  
SAM: Well, is there any way to mark it or something

2583
01:41:29.071 --> 01:41:30.728  
in case it moves?

2584
01:41:30.728 --> 01:41:32.128  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) You want to mark it?

2585
01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:35.964  
SAM: No, but set a trap around it or something.

2586
01:41:35.964 --> 01:41:37.006  
MATT: Make a perception check.

2587
01:41:37.006 --> 01:41:39.577  
TRAVIS: I mean, we can mark it.

2588
01:41:39.577 --> 01:41:40.918
ASHLEY: Is she alive?

2589
01:41:44.055 --> 01:41:45.496  
TALIESIN: It's very hard to move

2590
01:41:45.496 --> 01:41:46.932
through this place.
LAURA: 33.

2591
01:41:46.932 --> 01:41:48.599  
MARISHA: I hear that, yeah.

2592
01:41:49.547 --> 01:41:51.488
(rumbling footsteps)

2593
01:41:51.488 --> 01:41:52.471
TALIESIN: Perhaps...

2594
01:41:52.471 --> 01:41:53.767  
SAM: Closer?

2595
01:41:53.767 --> 01:41:55.192  
MATT: It's getting closer.

2596
01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:58.567  
SAM: All right, let's keep moving.

2597
01:41:58.567 --> 01:41:59.921  
LAURA: It sounds like footsteps,

2598
01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:02.748  
like very large. Oh my god.

2599
01:42:02.748 --> 01:42:03.581  
SAM: What?

2600
01:42:04.564 --> 01:42:08.034  
LAURA: Whose son was that thing that we fought?

2601
01:42:08.034 --> 01:42:09.824  
TRAVIS: We don't know.

2602
01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:12.055  
TALIESIN: Everything is somebody's son.

2603
01:42:12.055 --> 01:42:14.388  
LAURA: He was a god's son, wasn't he?

2604
01:42:14.388 --> 01:42:16.496  
He was something very large, a son.

2605
01:42:16.496 --> 01:42:20.190  
What if that is coming after us now?

2606
01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:21.282  
SAM: He was a god.

2607
01:42:21.282 --> 01:42:22.175  
He could probably fly.

2608
01:42:22.175 --> 01:42:23.217  
He wouldn't walk.

2609
01:42:23.217 --> 01:42:25.396  
LAURA: Probably you're right, you're right.

2610
01:42:25.396 --> 01:42:27.234  
MARISHA: I forgot his name.

2611
01:42:27.234 --> 01:42:28.067  
I took notes

2612
01:42:28.067 --> 01:42:29.301  
and I don't have my notebook.

2613
01:42:29.301 --> 01:42:30.509  
LAURA: Let's just keep walking.

2614
01:42:30.509 --> 01:42:32.872  
MATT: Nobody cast Legend Lore or anything,

2615
01:42:32.872 --> 01:42:33.880  
so you didn't learn a lot of information

2616
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.276  
beyond just what I said as part of the narrative.

2617
01:42:36.276 --> 01:42:37.615  
So you're not actually certain

2618
01:42:37.615 --> 01:42:39.847  
other than the fact that whatever you fought

2619
01:42:39.847 --> 01:42:40.939  
would've had some lineage

2620
01:42:40.939 --> 01:42:43.187  
of some very powerful

2621
01:42:43.187 --> 01:42:44.278  
celestial entity--
LAURA: He was yelling

2622
01:42:44.278 --> 01:42:45.336  
about his dad.

2623
01:42:45.336 --> 01:42:46.169  
MATT: Yeah.

2624
01:42:46.169 --> 01:42:47.866  
There was some sort of a paternal figure

2625
01:42:47.866 --> 01:42:50.146  
that it was shouting into the wind against.

2626
01:42:50.146 --> 01:42:52.595  
TRAVIS: Of godly origination.

2627
01:42:52.595 --> 01:42:55.167  
LAURA: Who doesn't have daddy issues?

2628
01:42:55.167 --> 01:42:56.917  
MARISHA: ♪ Daddy wasn't there. ♪

2629
01:42:58.602 --> 01:43:00.016  
Sorry, keep going.

2630
01:43:00.016 --> 01:43:01.349  
MATT: It's all right.

2631
01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:04.416  
You continue moving forward. I need

2632
01:43:04.416 --> 01:43:07.035  
you all have to make another wisdom check, please.

2633
01:43:07.035 --> 01:43:08.514  
ASHLEY: Still the saving throw?

2634
01:43:08.514 --> 01:43:09.626  
MATT: Still the saving throw.

2635
01:43:09.626 --> 01:43:11.459  
LAURA: With advantage.

2636
01:43:13.116 --> 01:43:13.989  
SAM: 15.

2637
01:43:13.989 --> 01:43:14.822  
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

2638
01:43:14.822 --> 01:43:15.655  
MATT: Nice.

2639
01:43:15.655 --> 01:43:16.488  
MARISHA: 34.

2640
01:43:16.488 --> 01:43:17.775  
MATT: All right, Lieve'tel?

2641
01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:19.300  
LIAM: Hold on, 16-- I've got lot of things to add.

2642
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:22.567  
Plus 16, plus 20-- this is a wisdom?

2643
01:43:22.567 --> 01:43:23.609  
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Then 31.

2644
01:43:23.609 --> 01:43:25.049  
MATT: 31.

2645
01:43:25.049 --> 01:43:25.882  
LAURA: 14.

2646
01:43:26.882 --> 01:43:27.715  
ASHLEY: 25.

2647
01:43:27.715 --> 01:43:28.548  
MATT: 25.

2648
01:43:28.548 --> 01:43:29.791  
TRAVIS: Grog rolled a natural 19.

2649
01:43:29.791 --> 01:43:31.214  
Bertrand Bell rolled a seven.

2650
01:43:31.214 --> 01:43:33.627  
MATT: Bertrand Bell gets another point of exhaustion.

2651
01:43:33.627 --> 01:43:34.706  
How many points does Bertrand Bell have?

2652
01:43:34.706 --> 01:43:35.539  
TRAVIS: That is two.

2653
01:43:35.539 --> 01:43:38.244  
MATT: Two, speed is halved for Bertrand Bell.

2654
01:43:38.244 --> 01:43:40.166  
TALIESIN: Put him on the bear.

2655
01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.236  
LAURA: Speaking of the bear,

2656
01:43:41.236 --> 01:43:43.154  
should I have been making wisdom saving throws

2657
01:43:43.154 --> 01:43:43.987  
for Trinket?

2658
01:43:43.987 --> 01:43:46.504  
TALIESIN: I assumed Trinket was in the necklace.

2659
01:43:46.504 --> 01:43:47.754  
LAURA: Well, I could say he was.

2660
01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.672  
MATT: Sure, Trinket was in your necklace.

2661
01:43:49.672 --> 01:43:51.160  
LAURA: I'll pop him out now

2662
01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.169  
so Bertrand can ride on him.

2663
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:55.002  
TRAVIS: Why?

2664
01:43:55.002 --> 01:43:56.669  
His speed's only 15. (laughs)

2665
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:01.165  
LAURA: I know, that's what I mean.

2666
01:44:01.165 --> 01:44:05.077  
TRAVIS: Oh god, thank god this bear is here.

2667
01:44:05.077 --> 01:44:06.160  
I'm so tired.

2668
01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:10.174  
Is it sand we're walking in?

2669
01:44:10.174 --> 01:44:12.472  
You guys go ahead.

2670
01:44:12.472 --> 01:44:14.978  
I'll guide from up here.

2671
01:44:14.978 --> 01:44:16.473  
LAURA: Just maybe take a nap or something.

2672
01:44:16.473 --> 01:44:19.961  
TRAVIS: Okay. (snoring)

2673
01:44:19.961 --> 01:44:21.132  
LIAM: I'm going to in this moment

2674
01:44:21.132 --> 01:44:24.290  
attempt to use Divine Intervention

2675
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:27.083  
and ask the Raven Queen what we're in danger of?

2676
01:44:27.083 --> 01:44:28.666  
What is going on?

2677
01:44:28.666 --> 01:44:29.518  
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2678
01:44:29.518 --> 01:44:30.976  
MATT: Okay.

2679
01:44:30.976 --> 01:44:32.510  
LAURA: While you're talking to her, let her know

2680
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:33.767  
she's a fucking bitch.

2681
01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:36.478  
TRAVIS: Hey, maybe not before the request.

2682
01:44:36.478 --> 01:44:37.311  
LAURA: Sorry.

2683
01:44:40.821 --> 01:44:41.654  
LIAM: Zero.

2684
01:44:43.899 --> 01:44:44.732  
Six.

2685
01:44:44.732 --> 01:44:45.815  
So it works.

2686
01:44:45.815 --> 01:44:46.944  
MATT: That succeeds.

2687
01:44:46.944 --> 01:44:49.884  
MARISHA: Oh my god!

2688
01:44:49.884 --> 01:44:50.717  
TRAVIS: Wow.

2689
01:44:53.155 --> 01:44:58.155  
MATT: As you reach up and clasp your clerical symbol,

2690
01:44:58.930 --> 01:45:02.865  
the small porcelain face of the Raven Queen,

2691
01:45:02.865 --> 01:45:04.730  
wreathed in black feathers

2692
01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:06.476  
that you keep hidden within your armor,

2693
01:45:06.476 --> 01:45:07.892  
you close your eyes

2694
01:45:07.892 --> 01:45:09.627  
and look outward,

2695
01:45:09.627 --> 01:45:10.702  
out towards the storm

2696
01:45:10.702 --> 01:45:12.438  
in the direction where you came from.

2697
01:45:12.438 --> 01:45:15.043  
The sand that blows by

2698
01:45:15.043 --> 01:45:16.710  
stops becoming sand.

2699
01:45:17.627 --> 01:45:20.646  
It's black feathers. (fluttering)

2700
01:45:20.646 --> 01:45:22.589  
All of a sudden, you are engulfed, all of you

2701
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:25.433  
in a storm of loose black feathers

2702
01:45:25.433 --> 01:45:27.285  
that are just battering into you

2703
01:45:27.285 --> 01:45:28.118  
across your face.

2704
01:45:28.118 --> 01:45:30.757  
It tickles, it feels strange,

2705
01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.063  
it's alien and unfamiliar.

2706
01:45:32.063 --> 01:45:36.052  
The temperature drops about 20 degrees at the same time

2707
01:45:36.052 --> 01:45:38.489  
and you, Lieve'tel,

2708
01:45:38.489 --> 01:45:43.148  
you watch as the feathers begin to part in front of you

2709
01:45:43.148 --> 01:45:45.918  
as part of this vision that is granted to you.

2710
01:45:45.918 --> 01:45:48.550  
None of the other see this, just the feathers.

2711
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:53.550  
The feathers part further and further past the tree

2712
01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:57.507  
and then just beyond the boundary of the tree,

2713
01:45:57.507 --> 01:46:01.924  
you see something massive

2714
01:46:03.305 --> 01:46:05.588
storming in your direction.

2715
01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.541  
It looks like it's made of solid sandstone,

2716
01:46:11.541 --> 01:46:13.413  
dull and gray,

2717
01:46:13.413 --> 01:46:15.461  
its eyes burning bright green,

2718
01:46:15.461 --> 01:46:18.241  
elemental in form,

2719
01:46:18.241 --> 01:46:22.392  
made up of seemingly

2720
01:46:22.392 --> 01:46:24.887
the elements of Pandemonium itself

2721
01:46:24.887 --> 01:46:28.319  
brought into a physical form.

2722
01:46:28.319 --> 01:46:32.267  
As each foot fall extends,

2723
01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:35.882
probably a 20-foot, 25 foot-gait.

2724
01:46:35.882 --> 01:46:38.332
(rumbling footsteps)

2725
01:46:39.426 --> 01:46:40.425  
As it approaches the tree,

2726
01:46:40.425 --> 01:46:44.184  
you watch its body tear apart.

2727
01:46:44.184 --> 01:46:45.769  
As the body breaks,

2728
01:46:45.769 --> 01:46:49.687  
it turns into a whirling tornado

2729
01:46:49.687 --> 01:46:50.894  
of the dust and sand

2730
01:46:50.894 --> 01:46:54.362  
that was once forming its physical body.

2731
01:46:54.362 --> 01:46:56.797  
As it tears through the tree,

2732
01:46:56.797 --> 01:47:01.193  
two of the fruit are ripped off of its branches.

2733
01:47:01.193 --> 01:47:03.790  
As it bursts through its boughs,

2734
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:07.068  
some of the tree's metallic branches (creaking)

2735
01:47:07.068 --> 01:47:09.428  
bend inward from the force

2736
01:47:09.428 --> 01:47:11.495  
as the sand scatters past.

2737
01:47:11.495 --> 01:47:15.396  
It all reforms once more into its full

2738
01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.479
elemental form.

2739
01:47:18.479 --> 01:47:22.257  
LIAM: Could we say that this is here upon us now?

2740
01:47:22.257 --> 01:47:23.151  
MATT: It's a ways away,

2741
01:47:23.151 --> 01:47:24.753  
but it's making its way in your direction.

2742
01:47:24.753 --> 01:47:26.242  
MARISHA: So run?

2743
01:47:26.242 --> 01:47:29.152  
MATT: It's going at a speed that is quite a bit faster

2744
01:47:29.152 --> 01:47:30.392  
than any of you've been moving.

2745
01:47:30.392 --> 01:47:32.335  
But it's a ways out,

2746
01:47:32.335 --> 01:47:33.752  
but it's gaining.

2747
01:47:34.655 --> 01:47:35.961  
LAURA: Is it at the tree already

2748
01:47:35.961 --> 01:47:37.171  
or was that a vision?

2749
01:47:37.171 --> 01:47:38.428  
TRAVIS: Only Lieve'tel sees it.

2750
01:47:38.428 --> 01:47:39.717  
LAURA: I know, I know,

2751
01:47:39.717 --> 01:47:41.189  
I was (gibberish).

2752
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:44.793  
LIAM: I start blurting out to the group what I've seen.

2753
01:47:44.793 --> 01:47:45.666  
I pull out the rod

2754
01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:48.232  
and I'm ready to jam it into the ground

2755
01:47:48.232 --> 01:47:49.868  
if we are staying here.

2756
01:47:49.868 --> 01:47:52.038  
Are we running or are we making a stand?

2757
01:47:52.038 --> 01:47:54.217  
LAURA: Why would we want to fucking fight a titan?

2758
01:47:54.217 --> 01:47:56.542  
TRAVIS: Running, running.

2759
01:47:56.542 --> 01:47:58.656  
TALIESIN: If we get the fort back,

2760
01:47:58.656 --> 01:47:59.646  
we don't have to fight anything.

2761
01:47:59.646 --> 01:48:02.259  
So we find our way to our things.

2762
01:48:02.259 --> 01:48:04.068  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) What does your rod do?

2763
01:48:04.068 --> 01:48:06.129  
LIAM: It improves our chances.

2764
01:48:06.129 --> 01:48:07.104  
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, let's keep running.

2765
01:48:07.104 --> 01:48:08.909  
We'll use it as a last resort.

2766
01:48:08.909 --> 01:48:10.178  
LAURA: Hey, while we're running,

2767
01:48:10.178 --> 01:48:11.221  
can anyone look at this fruit

2768
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:13.420  
and see if it does anything?

2769
01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.793  
Look at the fruit.

2770
01:48:14.793 --> 01:48:15.626  
Who can do this?

2771
01:48:15.626 --> 01:48:16.459  
SAM: I'll look at it.

2772
01:48:16.459 --> 01:48:17.688  
MATT: All right, make a nature check.

2773
01:48:17.688 --> 01:48:19.653  
SAM: A nature check.

2774
01:48:19.653 --> 01:48:21.346  
Yeah, nothing.

2775
01:48:21.346 --> 01:48:22.756  
MARISHA: Can I try?

2776
01:48:22.756 --> 01:48:23.638  
MATT: You can.

2777
01:48:23.638 --> 01:48:24.680  
SAM: 13.

2778
01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.118  
MATT: 13, yep, no idea.

2779
01:48:26.118 --> 01:48:28.809  
MARISHA: I'll make a nature check.

2780
01:48:28.809 --> 01:48:30.017  
TALIESIN: Oh!

2781
01:48:30.017 --> 01:48:32.434  
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, 27.

2782
01:48:34.211 --> 01:48:35.628  
MATT: 27.

2783
01:48:35.628 --> 01:48:37.561  
I'll say...

2784
01:48:39.978 --> 01:48:41.094
you've heard of this.

2785
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:43.147  
You've heard of it.

2786
01:48:43.147 --> 01:48:45.647  
It does not exist on Exandria.

2787
01:48:46.779 --> 01:48:50.029  
But you've heard the term pother fruit.

2788
01:48:51.083 --> 01:48:52.528  
MARISHA: Paw-- paw--

2789
01:48:52.528 --> 01:48:53.836
MATT: Pother fruit.

2790
01:48:54.774 --> 01:48:57.614  
The only thing you can recall about it

2791
01:48:57.614 --> 01:49:00.386  
is it's used in--

2792
01:49:00.386 --> 01:49:02.254  
it has been used in the past

2793
01:49:02.254 --> 01:49:04.771  
in extensive vision quests,

2794
01:49:06.192 --> 01:49:10.317  
but rarely and usually

2795
01:49:11.364 --> 01:49:13.080
in very intense

2796
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.826  
ancient rituals.

2797
01:49:14.826 --> 01:49:15.983  
It's been out of practice

2798
01:49:15.983 --> 01:49:17.733  
for a very long time.

2799
01:49:19.706 --> 01:49:20.539
MARISHA: Kay.

2800
01:49:24.076 --> 01:49:26.181  
LAURA: (whispering) I really want to eat it, though.

2801
01:49:26.181 --> 01:49:27.429  
SAM: Maybe we can feed it to the thing

2802
01:49:27.429 --> 01:49:29.893  
and it will go away and go on a vision quest.

2803
01:49:29.893 --> 01:49:30.726  
MARISHA: That's true.

2804
01:49:30.726 --> 01:49:32.051  
TALIESIN: It just ate two of them.

2805
01:49:32.051 --> 01:49:33.497  
LAURA: It didn't eat two of them.

2806
01:49:33.497 --> 01:49:34.671  
MARISHA: They flung out.

2807
01:49:34.671 --> 01:49:36.040  
TRAVIS: Can we run now?

2808
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:36.903  
SAM: Yes, let's run.

2809
01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.357  
LAURA: We're doing it as we're running.

2810
01:49:38.357 --> 01:49:39.690  
We're looking at the fruit.

2811
01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:42.856  
MATT: You're all shouting through the storm at each other.

2812
01:49:42.856 --> 01:49:44.343  
All right.

2813
01:49:44.343 --> 01:49:47.547  
Pushing on for this last bit,

2814
01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:49.562  
eventually you begin to see the familiar site

2815
01:49:49.562 --> 01:49:54.537  
of the large exterior of this sand-sundered citadel

2816
01:49:55.824 --> 01:49:57.152  
that lies out here,

2817
01:49:57.152 --> 01:50:00.310  
the one in your scrying vision.

2818
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:02.211  
You can see elements of the walls--

2819
01:50:02.211 --> 01:50:03.677  
LAURA: This fucking heart pounding

2820
01:50:03.677 --> 01:50:05.360
is creeping me the fuck out.

2821
01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.183  
MARISHA: I know, I know.
ASHLEY: Me, too.

2822
01:50:07.183 --> 01:50:09.269  
MATT: It curves inward slightly,

2823
01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.642  
but most of the roof has been worn away.

2824
01:50:12.642 --> 01:50:15.932  
It is a series of low and high walls.

2825
01:50:15.932 --> 01:50:16.891  
It seems like

2826
01:50:16.891 --> 01:50:19.879  
the thing has been slowly dissolving over time.

2827
01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:21.273  
You just see

2828
01:50:21.273 --> 01:50:22.893  
through the bit of storm and light that you have

2829
01:50:22.893 --> 01:50:24.133  
just the dark shapes.

2830
01:50:24.133 --> 01:50:25.637  
You come upon one of them

2831
01:50:25.637 --> 01:50:28.217  
and the metallic surface in the outside

2832
01:50:28.217 --> 01:50:31.077  
is pitch black metal.

2833
01:50:31.077 --> 01:50:32.309  
When your light goes across,

2834
01:50:32.309 --> 01:50:36.291  
it has a very faint greenish sheen across it.

2835
01:50:36.291 --> 01:50:37.742  
MARISHA: This is it.

2836
01:50:37.742 --> 01:50:39.504  
We're almost there.

2837
01:50:39.504 --> 01:50:40.921  
TRAVIS: Any way inside?

2838
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:43.536  
MARISHA: I don't know.

2839
01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:46.221  
He's around here tucked in

2840
01:50:46.221 --> 01:50:49.304  
under one of these collapsed caverns.

2841
01:50:50.586 --> 01:50:52.686  
SAM: Are there any doors or entrances?

2842
01:50:52.686 --> 01:50:54.290  
MATT: The walls are down and open.

2843
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:56.505  
You can literally just walk in from multiple sides.

2844
01:50:56.505 --> 01:50:58.094  
TALIESIN: Best be careful.

2845
01:50:58.094 --> 01:51:02.263  
MATT: It's the skeletal remains of

2846
01:51:02.263 --> 01:51:04.188
what was once a citadel

2847
01:51:04.188 --> 01:51:05.521  
made of this black metal,

2848
01:51:05.521 --> 01:51:07.996  
but most of it has eroded away in time

2849
01:51:07.996 --> 01:51:10.882  
and now it's just sections of its base walls

2850
01:51:10.882 --> 01:51:14.692  
and some element of a secondary floor that still remain.

2851
01:51:14.692 --> 01:51:16.560  
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object.

2852
01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:19.022  
MATT: All right, what are you casting it on?

2853
01:51:19.022 --> 01:51:23.102  
LAURA: On the... tuning fork.

2854
01:51:23.102 --> 01:51:23.935  
MATT: The tuning fork?

2855
01:51:23.935 --> 01:51:24.768  
LAURA: Yeah.

2856
01:51:24.768 --> 01:51:25.601  
MATT: Okay.

2857
01:51:26.859 --> 01:51:27.692  
Go ahead--

2858
01:51:28.968 --> 01:51:32.134  
LAURA: Within 1,000 feet of me.

2859
01:51:34.718 --> 01:51:35.551
Yeah.

2860
01:51:35.551 --> 01:51:36.384  
MATT: Okay.

2861
01:51:36.384 --> 01:51:37.458  
You cast the spell

2862
01:51:37.458 --> 01:51:41.625  
and you feel the spell draw and tug your attention

2863
01:51:41.625 --> 01:51:42.798  
at an angle

2864
01:51:42.798 --> 01:51:43.947  
away from where you're standing

2865
01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:45.741  
behind this one corner wall.

2866
01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:46.949  
LAURA: So there.

2867
01:51:46.949 --> 01:51:48.569  
MATT: The wind is so strong here

2868
01:51:48.569 --> 01:51:50.751  
that you cannot see past a certain distance.

2869
01:51:50.751 --> 01:51:52.537  
So make a perception check with a disadvantage

2870
01:51:52.537 --> 01:51:53.925  
to even make out--

2871
01:51:53.925 --> 01:51:55.250  
MARISHA: Even with the--

2872
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:57.499  
MATT: Your wind guide's just around you.

2873
01:51:57.499 --> 01:51:59.216  
It's like a shield right in front of you.

2874
01:51:59.216 --> 01:52:00.799  
The storm is dense.

2875
01:52:04.065 --> 01:52:05.360  
LAURA: 23.

2876
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:06.704  
MATT: 23 with disadvantage.

2877
01:52:06.704 --> 01:52:07.537  
LAURA: Yeah.

2878
01:52:07.537 --> 01:52:08.995  
MATT: Okay.

2879
01:52:08.995 --> 01:52:11.600  
You step around the outside wall--

2880
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.601  
LAURA: I've got 15 perception.

2881
01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:13.434  
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

2882
01:52:13.434 --> 01:52:14.392  
MATT: It's pretty good.

2883
01:52:14.392 --> 01:52:15.362  
Level 20.

2884
01:52:15.362 --> 01:52:17.022  
You glance around the side,

2885
01:52:17.022 --> 01:52:18.990  
where part of the wall crumbles

2886
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:22.660  
and you can see within what is visible detail-wise.

2887
01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:27.010  
This central plain

2888
01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:29.191  
with cracked elements of the marble floors

2889
01:52:29.191 --> 01:52:32.027  
that were once this beautiful citadel.

2890
01:52:32.027 --> 01:52:34.630  
You can see pillars that stand tall,

2891
01:52:34.630 --> 01:52:35.854  
one that is toppled over

2892
01:52:35.854 --> 01:52:38.217  
across and to the left of you.

2893
01:52:38.217 --> 01:52:39.869  
The direction it's pulling you towards

2894
01:52:39.869 --> 01:52:42.425  
is in the far corner opposite side,

2895
01:52:42.425 --> 01:52:45.111  
where that secondary floor is looming above.

2896
01:52:45.111 --> 01:52:47.824  
You can see rubble across it

2897
01:52:47.824 --> 01:52:51.708  
and jars and a box

2898
01:52:51.708 --> 01:52:54.849  
and things up on the second floor faintly.

2899
01:52:54.849 --> 01:52:56.934  
You can see below it in that direction

2900
01:52:56.934 --> 01:52:58.437  
there is a bookcase.

2901
01:52:58.437 --> 01:53:00.817  
You can see a desk to the left of it

2902
01:53:00.817 --> 01:53:03.263  
and there, sitting in the chair,

2903
01:53:04.163 --> 01:53:07.979  
is a figure currently writing that stops--

2904
01:53:07.979 --> 01:53:09.088
LAURA: Fucking Bob.

2905
01:53:09.088 --> 01:53:11.893
Matt: --and goes (sniffing).

2906
01:53:11.893 --> 01:53:12.726  
LAURA: I duck.

2907
01:53:17.064 --> 01:53:19.964  
MATT: (sniffing)

2908
01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.972  
Starts rummaging through the desk

2909
01:53:29.972 --> 01:53:31.836  
and pulls something out

2910
01:53:31.836 --> 01:53:34.669  
and holds it in front of his face.

2911
01:53:35.952 --> 01:53:38.669  
I want everyone to make a stealth check.

2912
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:40.081  
LAURA: Does our Pass Without a Trace-- is it still up?

2913
01:53:40.081 --> 01:53:40.983  
MATT: No, it is faded.

2914
01:53:40.983 --> 01:53:42.334  
TRAVIS: Do we have a Hold Gith-zanky or whatever?

2915
01:53:42.334 --> 01:53:43.967
Is it a Gith-zanky?

2916
01:53:43.967 --> 01:53:44.800  
MATT: Githzerai.

2917
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:47.667  
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2918
01:53:47.667 --> 01:53:48.981  
MATT: Nice.

2919
01:53:48.981 --> 01:53:50.236  
TRAVIS: Do we have Pass Without a Trace up?

2920
01:53:50.236 --> 01:53:52.975  
MATT: You do not.
LAURA: No, not anymore.

2921
01:53:52.975 --> 01:53:53.808  
SAM: 18.

2922
01:53:55.664 --> 01:53:57.372  
MARISHA: 28. Yeah, total.

2923
01:53:57.372 --> 01:53:58.205  
MATT: Percy?

2924
01:53:58.205 --> 01:53:59.038  
TALIESIN: 20.

2925
01:53:59.038 --> 01:53:59.871  
LIAM: 19.

2926
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:00.704  
LAURA: 26.

2927
01:54:00.704 --> 01:54:01.537  
ASHLEY: 21.

2928
01:54:01.537 --> 01:54:02.370  
SAM: Wow.

2929
01:54:02.370 --> 01:54:04.903  
TRAVIS: 14, 26.

2930
01:54:06.203 --> 01:54:07.894  
MATT: Not bad rolls, guys.

2931
01:54:07.894 --> 01:54:08.869
LAURA: Do I roll for Trinket?

2932
01:54:08.869 --> 01:54:09.777  
MATT: Yes.

2933
01:54:09.777 --> 01:54:11.360  
Not bad rolls, guys.

2934
01:54:14.701 --> 01:54:17.005  
TALIESIN: Do we all get a bonus from you or no?

2935
01:54:17.005 --> 01:54:20.860  
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I didn't roll at disadvantage.

2936
01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.377  
I'll make this Grog

2937
01:54:22.377 --> 01:54:24.659  
and this one Bertrand.

2938
01:54:24.659 --> 01:54:27.106  
Hey, those are fucking better.

2939
01:54:27.106 --> 01:54:30.023  
No worries, those are the low ones.

2940
01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:32.414  
That's amazing.
LAURA: I rolled 14 for

2941
01:54:32.414 --> 01:54:33.967  
Trinket. I don't know what I add.

2942
01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:35.174  
I don't think I had anything.

2943
01:54:35.174 --> 01:54:36.257  
MATT: No worries.

2944
01:54:41.258 --> 01:54:42.116  
ASHLEY: He's rummaging.

2945
01:54:42.116 --> 01:54:45.226  
SAM: He's rummaging through his desk just like Bob.

2946
01:54:45.226 --> 01:54:46.751  
LAURA: Fucking Bob.

2947
01:54:46.751 --> 01:54:48.302  
I know they should have some.

2948
01:54:48.302 --> 01:54:50.897  
I feel like we've stolen all of this.

2949
01:54:50.897 --> 01:54:54.311  
MATT: As he walks a few steps away from the desk,

2950
01:54:54.311 --> 01:54:56.978  
his voice carries past the wind.

2951
01:55:00.584 --> 01:55:01.917  
"You've returned."

2952
01:55:03.503 --> 01:55:04.336  
ASHLEY: Oh no.

2953
01:55:06.802 --> 01:55:08.502  
MATT: "I can hear you.

2954
01:55:16.226 --> 01:55:17.059  
"Nothing?"

2955
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.919  
LAURA: Should we say something?

2956
01:55:19.919 --> 01:55:22.218  
SAM: Yes, we've returned!

2957
01:55:22.218 --> 01:55:25.301  
We've returned to get our stuff, Bob.

2958
01:55:26.462 --> 01:55:28.928  
MATT: "What? You gave me presents."

2959
01:55:28.928 --> 01:55:30.511  
Takes the gem away.

2960
01:55:32.671 --> 01:55:33.966  
SAM: Presents?

2961
01:55:33.966 --> 01:55:36.959  
MATT: "I asked for presents and you gave them to me."

2962
01:55:36.959 --> 01:55:40.894  
SAM: I don't recall that happening at all.

2963
01:55:40.894 --> 01:55:41.977  
Are you sure?

2964
01:55:42.845 --> 01:55:45.656  
MATT: "I am positive of anything."

2965
01:55:45.656 --> 01:55:49.177  
SAM: Do you guys remember this part of the conversation?

2966
01:55:49.177 --> 01:55:50.715  
LAURA: I sort of remember something about presents,

2967
01:55:50.715 --> 01:55:53.459  
but then Keyleth gave you a fucking flowers or something.

2968
01:55:53.459 --> 01:55:56.154  
That was enough, right?

2969
01:55:56.154 --> 01:55:57.642  
ASHLEY: It didn't mean that you could take things

2970
01:55:57.642 --> 01:56:00.089  
that we didn't give you.

2971
01:56:00.089 --> 01:56:01.594  
TRAVIS: Yeah, tell 'em.

2972
01:56:01.594 --> 01:56:03.247  
ASHLEY: (faltering) Uh, you know?

2973
01:56:03.247 --> 01:56:05.497  
(laughing)

2974
01:56:08.554 --> 01:56:11.128  
ASHLEY: You took stuff that you shouldn't have taken.

2975
01:56:12.711 --> 01:56:15.628  
MATT: "Nothing was taken. It was gifted."

2976
01:56:17.066 --> 01:56:19.384  
SAM: I think I see what's going on.

2977
01:56:19.384 --> 01:56:22.358  
This is just a misunderstanding.

2978
01:56:22.358 --> 01:56:23.947  
If we could have our items back,

2979
01:56:23.947 --> 01:56:27.405  
perhaps we could give you some money for them?

2980
01:56:27.405 --> 01:56:29.504  
MATT: "What? Have it back? No!

2981
01:56:29.504 --> 01:56:30.504  
"I need them."

2982
01:56:31.825 --> 01:56:33.325  
SAM: May we approach?

2983
01:56:36.283 --> 01:56:37.991  
MATT: "Maybe."

2984
01:56:40.362 --> 01:56:41.456  
SAM: We're going to take that as a yes,

2985
01:56:41.456 --> 01:56:44.762  
since you took our offer of presents as a yes.

2986
01:56:44.762 --> 01:56:46.645  
So I'll start walking towards Bob.

2987
01:56:46.645 --> 01:56:47.478
TRAVIS: Go get 'em.

2988
01:56:47.478 --> 01:56:48.417  
MATT: Okay.

2989
01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:49.326  
LAURA: Yeah, I'll follow.

2990
01:56:49.326 --> 01:56:51.520  
ASHLEY: Same.
MATT: So you guys take steps.

2991
01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:52.879  
You guys take a couple steps.

2992
01:56:52.879 --> 01:56:55.510  
As you do, you watch the back wall.

2993
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:59.461  
There is a similar sculpture

2994
01:56:59.461 --> 01:57:01.643  
of the same black metal, the green sheen

2995
01:57:01.643 --> 01:57:03.032  
across the back chamber

2996
01:57:03.032 --> 01:57:04.854  
that sits behind the desk.

2997
01:57:07.212 --> 01:57:09.344  
It's in the shape of a creature

2998
01:57:09.344 --> 01:57:11.259  
holding up the second floor,

2999
01:57:11.259 --> 01:57:13.009  
like a humanoid body.

3000
01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:17.818  
As you take steps, it (crashing)

3001
01:57:17.818 --> 01:57:21.449  
and takes two steps and stops when you stop.

3002
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.980  
It stands about 15 feet tall

3003
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.153  
and is made of the same black metal.

3004
01:57:29.153 --> 01:57:30.825  
You can see bits of rock and stone

3005
01:57:30.825 --> 01:57:32.561  
that cracked out of its arms

3006
01:57:32.561 --> 01:57:37.453  
as it dislodged itself from the back chamber wall.

3007
01:57:38.835 --> 01:57:41.252  
MARISHA: Bob, Bob, summoned that guy?

3008
01:57:42.114 --> 01:57:43.307  
MATT: It seemed to step forward

3009
01:57:43.307 --> 01:57:45.010  
without Bob doing anything,

3010
01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:46.877  
but as you begin to walk forward,

3011
01:57:46.877 --> 01:57:47.710  
it began to walk forward.

3012
01:57:47.710 --> 01:57:49.326  
SAM: Easy Bob, it's all right,

3013
01:57:49.326 --> 01:57:51.507  
we're not going to cause you any harm.

3014
01:57:51.507 --> 01:57:54.004  
You can call off your friend.

3015
01:57:54.004 --> 01:57:56.856  
MATT: "What do you mean to take back, then?"

3016
01:57:56.856 --> 01:57:58.338  
TALIESIN: Honestly,

3017
01:57:58.338 --> 01:57:59.940  
if we're going to be fair,

3018
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.106  
we're strangers in this place.

3019
01:58:02.106 --> 01:58:03.891  
We're having a very difficult day.

3020
01:58:03.891 --> 01:58:07.591  
There are matters of timing

3021
01:58:07.591 --> 01:58:10.240  
that we should probably all discuss.

3022
01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:11.798  
LAURA: Why don't we all just sit down

3023
01:58:11.798 --> 01:58:14.483
and have a nice cup of tea?

3024
01:58:14.483 --> 01:58:15.316  
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3025
01:58:15.316 --> 01:58:17.498  
MATT: "You bring tea presents?"

3026
01:58:17.498 --> 01:58:19.350  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah, when was the last time

3027
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:22.600  
you had, like, a nice snack and a nibble?

3028
01:58:23.434 --> 01:58:28.228  
MATT: Thinks to himself. He's like, "A very long time."

3029
01:58:28.228 --> 01:58:29.813  
TRAVIS: Well, that's what we should have,

3030
01:58:29.813 --> 01:58:31.965  
a proper tea party.

3031
01:58:31.965 --> 01:58:32.891  
TALIESIN: Let's have a moment

3032
01:58:32.891 --> 01:58:37.586  
and have a discussion about a way for all of this

3033
01:58:37.586 --> 01:58:39.291  
to end agreeably for everybody.

3034
01:58:39.291 --> 01:58:40.466
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
LIAM: But quickly

3035
01:58:40.466 --> 01:58:44.041  
because you never know when guests may drop in.

3036
01:58:46.377 --> 01:58:47.877  
TALIESIN: Oh that's awful.

3037
01:58:48.896 --> 01:58:50.052  
11.

3038
01:58:50.052 --> 01:58:50.885  
MATT: 11.

3039
01:58:53.385 --> 01:58:56.153  
TALIESIN: There is a thing chasing us.

3040
01:58:56.153 --> 01:58:58.336  
MATT: "Oh, the rolling danger.

3041
01:58:58.336 --> 01:59:00.865  
"The thunder that comes, yes."

3042
01:59:00.865 --> 01:59:01.698  
TALIESIN: It has a name?

3043
01:59:01.698 --> 01:59:05.197  
MATT: "What do you think destroyed this citadel?"

3044
01:59:05.197 --> 01:59:06.822  
TALIESIN: Bloody hell.
ASHLEY: Wonderful.

3045
01:59:08.739 --> 01:59:10.504  
What's that statue out front

3046
01:59:10.504 --> 01:59:13.087  
with the woman with the blades?

3047
01:59:15.528 --> 01:59:16.754  
SAM: The Blade Queen.

3048
01:59:16.754 --> 01:59:17.646  
ASHLEY: The Blade Queen?

3049
01:59:17.646 --> 01:59:20.246  
MATT: "No, the Lady of Pain."

3050
01:59:21.812 --> 01:59:23.459  
ASHLEY: The Lady of Pain?

3051
01:59:23.459 --> 01:59:25.400  
MATT: "I remember that.

3052
01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.327  
"I don't remember much, but I remember that."

3053
01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:29.727  
TRAVIS: She has many names.

3054
01:59:29.727 --> 01:59:32.625  
LAURA: Bob, do you remember how you told us

3055
01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:35.296  
you were going to give all of our stuff back?

3056
01:59:35.296 --> 01:59:36.610  
MATT: "No!"

3057
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:37.443  
LAURA: You said that.

3058
01:59:37.443 --> 01:59:38.757  
MATT: "You gave me presents

3059
01:59:38.757 --> 01:59:39.834  
"and the presents are mine

3060
01:59:39.834 --> 01:59:41.471  
"and I keep them! I need them."

3061
01:59:41.471 --> 01:59:42.463  
SAM: Why do you need them?

3062
01:59:42.463 --> 01:59:45.886  
Could they be replaced with money or other presents?

3063
01:59:45.886 --> 01:59:48.016  
MATT: "No, I've taken money.

3064
01:59:48.016 --> 01:59:50.482  
"I need to go somewhere."

3065
01:59:50.482 --> 01:59:51.315  
LAURA: Where do you need to go?

3066
01:59:51.315 --> 01:59:52.466  
SAM: We can help you with that.

3067
01:59:52.466 --> 01:59:53.408  
MATT: "Home."

3068
01:59:53.408 --> 01:59:55.074  
SAM: What's home?

3069
01:59:55.074 --> 01:59:56.202  
MATT: "I don't remember."

3070
01:59:56.202 --> 01:59:57.145  
SAM: Oh boy.

3071
01:59:57.145 --> 01:59:58.427  
TRAVIS: Do you remember the

3072
01:59:58.427 --> 02:00:01.774  
way it looked like or people that you miss

3073
02:00:01.774 --> 02:00:03.274  
or things you did?

3074
02:00:06.916 --> 02:00:08.686  
MATT: "I came with more,

3075
02:00:08.686 --> 02:00:11.161  
"but now it's just me.

3076
02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.408  
"But I don't remember what they looked like."

3077
02:00:15.408 --> 02:00:16.616  
SAM: Did they look like you?

3078
02:00:16.616 --> 02:00:18.741  
MATT: "I don't know!"

3079
02:00:19.822 --> 02:00:21.922  
SAM: Do we know anything just from his appearance

3080
02:00:21.922 --> 02:00:26.089  
about what his history might be?

3081
02:00:29.237 --> 02:00:31.495  
MATT: Make an arcana check.

3082
02:00:31.495 --> 02:00:33.314  
MARISHA: Come on, lore bard.

3083
02:00:33.314 --> 02:00:34.147  
Lord bard.

3084
02:00:37.455 --> 02:00:38.538  
SAM: Arcana, 19.

3085
02:00:41.775 --> 02:00:43.477  
MATT: The most you know about the githzerai

3086
02:00:43.477 --> 02:00:48.477  
is that they're an offshoot of the gith.

3087
02:00:49.239 --> 02:00:52.524  
There's the githyanki and the githzerai.

3088
02:00:52.524 --> 02:00:56.801  
They were once enslaved by the mind flayers

3089
02:00:56.801 --> 02:00:57.634  
across the plain,

3090
02:00:57.634 --> 02:00:59.801  
then eventually escaped enslavement.

3091
02:00:59.801 --> 02:01:01.987  
The githzerai went to Limbo

3092
02:01:01.987 --> 02:01:05.821  
and pursue more spiritual pursuits.

3093
02:01:07.357 --> 02:01:12.333  
Through the use of psychic capabilities and such,

3094
02:01:12.333 --> 02:01:14.947  
can manipulate matter on that plane.

3095
02:01:14.947 --> 02:01:17.705  
That's as much as you can recall with that roll.

3096
02:01:20.583 --> 02:01:25.248  
SAM: I have some idea of where your people might have gone.

3097
02:01:25.248 --> 02:01:27.889  
To a place called Limbo.

3098
02:01:27.889 --> 02:01:30.439  
Does that sound familiar to you?

3099
02:01:30.439 --> 02:01:31.962  
MATT: "A little."

3100
02:01:31.962 --> 02:01:36.954  
(singing the tune of "Limbo Rock")

3101
02:01:36.954 --> 02:01:41.870
(singing the tune of "Limbo Rock")

3102
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:43.503
(singing the tune of "Limbo Rock")

3103
02:01:43.503 --> 02:01:46.286
(laughing and singing)

3104
02:01:46.286 --> 02:01:47.394  
MATT: This got really weird.

3105
02:01:47.394 --> 02:01:52.185
(continue singing the tune "Limbo Rock")

3106
02:01:52.185 --> 02:01:54.660
(continue singing the tune "Limbo Rock")

3107
02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:57.126
TRAVIS: (loud high-pitched laughter)

3108
02:01:57.126 --> 02:02:01.017  
LIAM: The wind just (wind whistling).

3109
02:02:01.017 --> 02:02:03.332  
MATT: "Thank you for your routine.

3110
02:02:03.332 --> 02:02:05.239  
"It has been awhile since anyone

3111
02:02:05.239 --> 02:02:07.989  
"has done any sort of performance."

3112
02:02:09.023 --> 02:02:10.606  
TRAVIS: Sound of home.

3113
02:02:10.606 --> 02:02:14.305  
ASHLEY: We could take you.
TRAVIS: Scanbo,

3114
02:02:14.305 --> 02:02:18.679  
don't you have the ability to make one incredible thing

3115
02:02:18.679 --> 02:02:20.268  
happen every day?

3116
02:02:20.268 --> 02:02:22.695  
SAM: I do, I do.

3117
02:02:22.695 --> 02:02:24.052  
TRAVIS: You wouldn't even need to know

3118
02:02:24.052 --> 02:02:26.177  
where he was from.

3119
02:02:27.602 --> 02:02:29.323  
SAM: That's true.

3120
02:02:29.323 --> 02:02:30.983  
That's a bit of a risk,

3121
02:02:30.983 --> 02:02:33.338  
but one I'm willing to take

3122
02:02:33.338 --> 02:02:35.660  
if Bob is willing to take a risk

3123
02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.983  
and give us back our belongings.

3124
02:02:38.983 --> 02:02:41.470  
Bob, you with us, buddy?

3125
02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:42.568  
MATT: "What?

3126
02:02:42.568 --> 02:02:43.539  
"Hi."

3127
02:02:43.539 --> 02:02:44.965  
SAM: What do you want more,

3128
02:02:44.965 --> 02:02:48.672  
to go home or to keep our belongings?

3129
02:02:48.672 --> 02:02:50.209  
MATT: "To go home,

3130
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:52.042  
"but I need your things to go home, I believe.

02:02:52.042 --> 02:02:53.764  
"I've been categorizing

3132
02:02:53.764 --> 02:02:55.879  
"and I think I've figured it out."

3133
02:02:55.879 --> 02:02:57.368  
TALIESIN: You've been categorizing?

3134
02:02:57.368 --> 02:02:58.201  
ASHLEY: How come?

3135
02:02:58.201 --> 02:03:00.279  
MARISHA: What'd you figure out?

3136
02:03:00.279 --> 02:03:01.112  
MATT: "I

3137
02:03:02.462 --> 02:03:06.153
"know that some of the pieces <i>I</i> need to go home.

"I forget how to go home,

3139
02:03:10.611 --> 02:03:12.611  
"but I found the piece."

3140
02:03:14.181 --> 02:03:15.804  
TALIESIN: Can we see the piece. perhaps

3141
02:03:15.804 --> 02:03:17.473  
or at least have you written it down?

3142
02:03:17.473 --> 02:03:18.614  
Can you show us what you wrote?

3143
02:03:18.614 --> 02:03:19.447  
MATT: "I have."

3144
02:03:20.696 --> 02:03:23.270  
TALIESIN: We're a bit pressed for time,

3145
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:26.235  
so could you show us very quickly?

3146
02:03:26.235 --> 02:03:27.656  
TALIESIN: Make a persuasion check.

3147
02:03:27.656 --> 02:03:28.489  
TALIESIN: Oh lord.

3148
02:03:33.428 --> 02:03:34.595  
That's better!

3149
02:03:36.884 --> 02:03:38.107  
That's a 24.

3150
02:03:38.107 --> 02:03:41.191  
MATT: 24, he goes, "Stay there!"

3151
02:03:42.584 --> 02:03:45.776  
He backs away carefully a couple steps

3152
02:03:45.776 --> 02:03:46.734  
and then you watch him

3153
02:03:46.734 --> 02:03:48.258  
and he just vanishes

3154
02:03:48.258 --> 02:03:50.025  
and reappears elsewhere.

3155
02:03:50.025 --> 02:03:51.168  
TALIESIN: Did he make a noise

3156
02:03:51.168 --> 02:03:52.342  
or did he say anything

3157
02:03:52.342 --> 02:03:53.814  
or was it just a teleport?

3158
02:03:53.814 --> 02:03:56.161  
MATT: No, just blinked about 30 feet away.

3159
02:03:56.161 --> 02:03:57.253  
LIAM: Further away?

3160
02:03:57.253 --> 02:03:58.225  
MATT: Further away from you.

3161
02:03:58.225 --> 02:04:02.362  
LIAM: Robert, we have not forgotten anything

3162
02:04:02.362 --> 02:04:04.478  
and if you give us our belongings back,

3163
02:04:04.478 --> 02:04:08.149  
we know how to help you get where you want to go.

3164
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:10.355  
MATT: He grabs a book.

3165
02:04:10.355 --> 02:04:12.721
(rustling pages)

3166
02:04:16.628 --> 02:04:17.545  
"I found it!"

3167
02:04:18.829 --> 02:04:19.662  
TALIESIN: May I?

3168
02:04:19.662 --> 02:04:21.488  
LAURA: Percival's incredibly smart.

3169
02:04:21.488 --> 02:04:25.575  
SAM: Yes, yes, let me look at it really quick.

3170
02:04:25.575 --> 02:04:26.408  
MATT: "Not you! You."

3171
02:04:26.408 --> 02:04:27.366  
TALIESIN: That'll do.

3172
02:04:27.366 --> 02:04:28.448  
In fact, that makes it better.

3173
02:04:28.448 --> 02:04:29.656  
MATT: "Step forward.

3174
02:04:29.656 --> 02:04:32.155  
"Everyone else stay where you are!"

3175
02:04:32.155 --> 02:04:34.023  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) I can sit down right where I am.

3176
02:04:34.023 --> 02:04:36.341  
SAM: ♪ Stay where you are! ♪

3177
02:04:36.341 --> 02:04:40.951  
TALIESIN: Darling, could you just keep an ear to the ground?

3178
02:04:40.951 --> 02:04:42.368  
MATT: His eyes are just darting all over the place.

3179
02:04:42.368 --> 02:04:44.188  
He doesn't really make eye contact very well.

3180
02:04:44.188 --> 02:04:47.017  
LAURA: I'm on all fours with my ear to the ground

3181
02:04:47.017 --> 02:04:48.507  
MATT: Persuasion check.

3182
02:04:48.507 --> 02:04:52.545  
Oh sorry, persuade that dirt to tell you what's up.

3183
02:04:52.545 --> 02:04:54.070  
Perception check, please.

3184
02:04:57.094 --> 02:04:58.742
TRAVIS: 500.

3185
02:04:58.742 --> 02:05:00.408  
LAURA: 31.

3186
02:05:00.408 --> 02:05:01.241  
MATT: 31.

3187
02:05:02.167 --> 02:05:04.965  
(fast, loud rumbling footsteps)

3188
02:05:04.965 --> 02:05:06.300  
TALIESIN: Time is really running out.

3189
02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:07.822  
Fine, I'm going to hop on over.

3190
02:05:07.822 --> 02:05:08.995  
Hi.

3191
02:05:08.995 --> 02:05:09.828  
MATT: "Hello."

3192
02:05:09.828 --> 02:05:10.661  
TALIESIN: Time is running out

3193
02:05:10.661 --> 02:05:12.038  
and we could all leave here,

3194
02:05:12.038 --> 02:05:13.591  
if we just could convince you

3195
02:05:13.591 --> 02:05:15.258  
to trust us, please.

3196
02:05:16.139 --> 02:05:19.312  
MATT: Looks up to the large

3197
02:05:19.312 --> 02:05:21.428  
golem made of this black metal,

3198
02:05:21.428 --> 02:05:23.760  
just (creaks) leans forward,

3199
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:27.074  
this large blade dragging behind it.

3200
02:05:27.074 --> 02:05:27.907  
"Should we?"

3201
02:05:30.568 --> 02:05:32.037  
MARISHA: (stage whispered) Say yes!

3202
02:05:32.037 --> 02:05:34.184  
SAM: I don't think he can talk.

3203
02:05:34.184 --> 02:05:36.483  
TALIESIN: I believe you asked: should we?

3204
02:05:36.483 --> 02:05:39.417  
MATT: "Right. Perhaps. He likes you."

3205
02:05:39.417 --> 02:05:41.334  
And shows you the book.

3206
02:05:42.344 --> 02:05:45.782  
A language you do not understand scrawled everywhere

3207
02:05:45.782 --> 02:05:47.452  
and there are drawings and haphazard sketches

3208
02:05:47.452 --> 02:05:51.503  
and smiley faces and weird little designs.

3209
02:05:51.503 --> 02:05:54.330  
You do see one really, really nice sketch

3210
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:55.834  
of a piece of metal

3211
02:05:55.834 --> 02:05:59.942  
that has been bound and bent

3212
02:05:59.942 --> 02:06:04.087  
to form into two additional pieces of metal.

3213
02:06:04.087 --> 02:06:05.787  
TALIESIN: Do I know what this is?

3214
02:06:05.787 --> 02:06:06.620  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) Is it minotaur?

3215
02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:07.590  
I speak minotaur.

3216
02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:10.183  
TALIESIN: It's a tuning fork, isn't it?

3217
02:06:10.183 --> 02:06:11.261  
MATT: Yeah.

3218
02:06:13.011 --> 02:06:14.636  
TALIESIN: I think I can get you home.

3219
02:06:16.603 --> 02:06:17.807  
MATT: "How?

3220
02:06:17.807 --> 02:06:18.640  
"Tell me."

3221
02:06:19.765 --> 02:06:21.848  
TALIESIN: We, in our possessions,

3222
02:06:22.761 --> 02:06:25.261  
have the necessary tools

3223
02:06:25.261 --> 02:06:26.553  
to, at the very least,

3224
02:06:26.553 --> 02:06:29.364  
bring you to where I believe you might be from.

3225
02:06:29.364 --> 02:06:30.248  
At the very least,

3226
02:06:30.248 --> 02:06:32.356  
we can bring you somewhere that isn't here

3227
02:06:32.356 --> 02:06:33.878  
and I guarantee that where we bring you

3228
02:06:33.878 --> 02:06:36.186  
is far better than this.

3229
02:06:36.186 --> 02:06:37.231  
MATT: "I don't know.

3230
02:06:37.231 --> 02:06:39.052  
"I kind of like it here."

3231
02:06:39.052 --> 02:06:39.885  
SAM: Oh boy.

3232
02:06:39.885 --> 02:06:41.102  
TALIESIN: Do you kind of like it here?

3233
02:06:41.102 --> 02:06:41.935  
MATT: "No."

3234
02:06:41.935 --> 02:06:44.537  
TALIESIN: Then why don't you come with us?

3235
02:06:44.537 --> 02:06:47.895  
MATT: "Hmm." Takes a step back. "Maybe."

3236
02:06:49.178 --> 02:06:52.652  
MARISHA: There are a lot more gifts where we're from.

3237
02:06:52.652 --> 02:06:55.039  
MATT: "More gifts?"

3238
02:06:55.039 --> 02:06:57.008  
MARISHA: We can give you more gifts if you just come with us

3239
02:06:57.008 --> 02:07:00.087  
and give us the stuff now--

3240
02:07:00.087 --> 02:07:01.470  
TALIESIN: Not anything we have right now,

3241
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:03.422  
but things at our home.

3242
02:07:03.422 --> 02:07:04.762  
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Because if the rolling thunder gets here,

3243
02:07:04.762 --> 02:07:07.103  
the gifts are limited.

3244
02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:10.714  
MATT: "I don't like limited gifts."

3245
02:07:10.714 --> 02:07:12.152  
TALIESIN: No one likes limited gifts.

3246
02:07:12.152 --> 02:07:14.843  
LAURA: Unlimited gifts if you just give us our shit.

3247
02:07:14.843 --> 02:07:16.567  
We'll take you to unlimited presents.

3248
02:07:16.567 --> 02:07:18.952  
ASHLEY: And unlimited tuning forks.

3249
02:07:18.952 --> 02:07:21.544  
MATT: "Promise on the gifts."

3250
02:07:23.375 --> 02:07:25.605  
TALIESIN: Here is my promise.

3251
02:07:25.605 --> 02:07:28.236  
I promise that we will do everything in our power

3252
02:07:28.236 --> 02:07:29.569  
to get you home.

3253
02:07:33.819 --> 02:07:36.591  
MATT: He leans really close to you.

3254
02:07:36.591 --> 02:07:37.845  
There should be eye contact,

3255
02:07:37.845 --> 02:07:38.920  
the pupils are doing everything

3256
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:41.234  
but make contact with yours.

3257
02:07:41.234 --> 02:07:43.791  
TALIESIN: I wish that I could show you

3258
02:07:43.791 --> 02:07:45.979  
just how generous this offer is.

3259
02:07:45.979 --> 02:07:47.328  
MATT: "Okay."

3260
02:07:47.328 --> 02:07:48.717  
TALIESIN: Okay?

3261
02:07:48.717 --> 02:07:50.146  
MATT: "Okay."

3262
02:07:50.146 --> 02:07:52.536  
TALIESIN: Can you show us our things, please?

3263
02:07:52.536 --> 02:07:54.044  
MATT: "Maybe."

3264
02:07:54.044 --> 02:07:54.877  
LAURA: Oh my god.

3265
02:07:54.877 --> 02:07:56.276  
TALIESIN: Can I take that maybe as a yes?

3266
02:07:56.276 --> 02:07:57.222  
MATT: "Yes."

3267
02:07:57.222 --> 02:07:58.555  
TALIESIN: Excellent.

3268
02:07:58.555 --> 02:07:59.555
(crashing sound)

3269
02:07:59.555 --> 02:08:00.876  
TALIESIN: Now would be the time!

3270
02:08:00.876 --> 02:08:02.827  
MATT: A heavy impact blast

3271
02:08:02.827 --> 02:08:03.660  
as you watch--

3272
02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:04.785
TRAVIS: (yelling)

3273
02:08:04.785 --> 02:08:05.886  
MATT: -- coming out of the shadow,

3274
02:08:05.886 --> 02:08:10.886  
this large, looming foot of condensed stone and dust,

3275
02:08:11.121 --> 02:08:12.499  
slam into the ground

3276
02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:13.787  
causing this immediate crater

3277
02:08:13.787 --> 02:08:15.624  
to crack into the Earth

3278
02:08:15.624 --> 02:08:17.506  
on the outskirts of the structure.

3279
02:08:17.506 --> 02:08:18.532  
Glancing over your shoulder,

3280
02:08:18.532 --> 02:08:21.262  
you can see now, its lower body is condensed

3281
02:08:21.262 --> 02:08:23.427  
and its stone upper body is still a swirling maelstrom

3282
02:08:23.427 --> 02:08:25.990  
of sand and rock and pebble

3283
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:28.949  
as it forms back into its densed upper form.

3284
02:08:28.949 --> 02:08:32.984  
Its eyes burn with vibrant green energy.

3285
02:08:32.984 --> 02:08:35.510  
Flames seem to be shooting from the front

3286
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:37.690  
as it angrily growls toward you.

3287
02:08:37.690 --> 02:08:39.329  
Soundlessly, this low guttural rumble

3288
02:08:39.329 --> 02:08:40.536  
just emits from it

3289
02:08:40.536 --> 02:08:41.991  
that quakes the ground around you.

3290
02:08:41.991 --> 02:08:45.744  
Watch stones rattle across the ground.

3291
02:08:45.744 --> 02:08:46.577  
TALIESIN: What does it want?

3292
02:08:46.577 --> 02:08:48.977  
LAURA: I shoot and I run. Just kidding, no.

3293
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:50.993  
LIAM: Plant the rod.

3294
02:08:50.993 --> 02:08:51.826  
MATT: Right.

3295
02:08:51.826 --> 02:08:54.403  
We're going to go ahead and take a break

3296
02:08:54.403 --> 02:08:57.961  
and pick up from there to roll initiative.

3297
02:08:57.961 --> 02:09:00.099  
LAURA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: I almost threw up.

3298
02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:02.027  
TALIESIN: Not okay.

3299
02:09:02.027 --> 02:09:03.980  
MARISHA: We should just teleport away.

3300
02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:06.278  
We just need to teleport away.

3301
02:09:06.278 --> 02:09:07.945  
LAURA: Let's teleport away.

3302
02:09:10.096 --> 02:09:11.402  
MARISHA: It's one round, so one action

3303
02:09:11.402 --> 02:09:13.253  
where we just all have to hold hands.

3304
02:09:13.253 --> 02:09:15.674  
LAURA: Got to get to the shit and just do it.

3305
02:09:15.674 --> 02:09:17.833  
MARISHA: Hold hands, kumbaya.

3306
02:09:17.833 --> 02:09:19.140  
TRAVIS: We'll talk about it after the break.

3307
02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:19.973  
MATT: We will.

3308
02:09:19.973 --> 02:09:21.669  
All right. We'll be back here in just a few minutes.

3309
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:23.536  
We're going to take a quick restroom break, snack break,

3310
02:09:23.536 --> 02:09:24.494  
and we'll be back here

3311
02:09:24.494 --> 02:09:27.287  
with whatever this encounter's going to be.

3312
02:09:27.287 --> 02:09:29.101  
All right, see you guys in a second.

3313
02:09:29.101 --> 02:09:30.201
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

3314
02:09:33.571 --> 02:09:35.045  
MATT: And welcome back.

3315
02:09:36.811 --> 02:09:37.820  
Back from our break,

3316
02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:40.302  
guys. We've placed ourselves amongst the battle map

3317
02:09:40.302 --> 02:09:41.885  
as to where you are.

3318
02:09:41.885 --> 02:09:46.042  
We have Bob right here with his large protector,

3319
02:09:46.042 --> 02:09:47.713  
which emerged from the back wall.

3320
02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:49.926  
Somewhere in the map in this vicinity

3321
02:09:49.926 --> 02:09:54.160  
of which you ascertain the direction, Vex'ahlia,

3322
02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.634  
seemed to have been the fork in question.

3323
02:09:56.634 --> 02:09:57.881  
Not entirely certain

3324
02:09:57.881 --> 02:10:00.169  
where the rest of your belongings are,

3325
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:01.669  
if near it or not.

3326
02:10:03.339 --> 02:10:04.880  
But nevertheless,

3327
02:10:06.163 --> 02:10:07.031
this--

3328
02:10:07.031 --> 02:10:09.753  
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

3329
02:10:09.753 --> 02:10:10.877  
Are you crazy?

3330
02:10:10.877 --> 02:10:13.919  
MATT: --just slammed through the space.

3331
02:10:13.919 --> 02:10:14.752  
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

3332
02:10:16.002 --> 02:10:17.374  
LAURA: Can I ask a question really fast?

3333
02:10:17.374 --> 02:10:18.207  
MATT: Yes.

3334
02:10:18.207 --> 02:10:20.790  
LAURA: Is my Locate Object still up?

3335
02:10:21.946 --> 02:10:23.233  
MATT: It should be.

3336
02:10:23.233 --> 02:10:24.791  
LAURA: It lasts for ten minutes.

3337
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:25.888  
MATT: As long as you hold your concentration, yes.

3338
02:10:25.888 --> 02:10:27.254  
LAURA: So I would have a pretty good idea

3339
02:10:27.254 --> 02:10:28.636  
of where it is within the room then, wouldn't I?

3340
02:10:28.636 --> 02:10:29.826  
MATT: You would say, yeah.

3341
02:10:29.826 --> 02:10:32.326  
Let me look up the spell real fast.

3342
02:10:35.222 --> 02:10:36.946  
And--! Question.

3343
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:42.934  
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that thing is fucking huge.

3344
02:10:42.934 --> 02:10:44.210  
SAM: He's not that much bigger

3345
02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:45.648  
than the 15-foot thing.

3346
02:10:45.648 --> 02:10:47.219  
TRAVIS: It's like a giant or a titan

3347
02:10:47.219 --> 02:10:48.719  
or a rock behemoth,

3348
02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:51.964  
but it's made of

3349
02:10:51.964 --> 02:10:53.505  
particles of dust. And dirt.

3350
02:10:53.505 --> 02:10:54.813
LAURA: Is it what's-his-face?

3351
02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.876  
Does he look friendly?
I can't see his face.

3352
02:10:56.876 --> 02:10:58.892  
MATT: Through the wind and dust that's blasting,

3353
02:10:58.892 --> 02:11:01.309  
you know it's this direction,

3354
02:11:03.334 --> 02:11:05.667  
like somewhere in this area.

3355
02:11:08.133 --> 02:11:09.572  
LAURA: Can you see on the map,

3356
02:11:09.572 --> 02:11:11.820  
is there shit on the other side of that wall?

3357
02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:12.903  
I can't see.

3358
02:11:12.903 --> 02:11:14.284  
I guess we wouldn't see.

3359
02:11:14.284 --> 02:11:15.406  
It doesn't matter that I can't see

3360
02:11:15.406 --> 02:11:16.489  
because I can't see.

3361
02:11:16.489 --> 02:11:18.455  
MATT: All right, so initiative everybody.

3362
02:11:18.455 --> 02:11:19.838
LIAM: Oh, your voice.

3363
02:11:20.721 --> 02:11:22.831  
TALIESIN: We're going to roll advantage with initiative.

3364
02:11:22.831 --> 02:11:24.122  
MATT: It is an ability check so, you do.

3365
02:11:24.122 --> 02:11:25.953  
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Yeah, all things

3366
02:11:25.953 --> 02:11:27.916  
pretty much.
TALIESIN: This is disturbing.

3367
02:11:27.916 --> 02:11:30.650  
LIAM: Does this get affected by exhaustion?

3368
02:11:30.650 --> 02:11:32.330  
MATT: It would, yes.

3369
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:34.217  
It is an ability check.

3370
02:11:34.217 --> 02:11:35.050  
LIAM: Okay.

3371
02:11:37.667 --> 02:11:40.262  
MATT: So, 25 to 20 or higher.

3372
02:11:40.262 --> 02:11:41.095  
LAURA: 25.

3373
02:11:41.095 --> 02:11:41.928  
TALIESIN: 25.

3374
02:11:41.928 --> 02:11:42.987  
MATT: Ooh, look at that,

3375
02:11:42.987 --> 02:11:44.458  
the couple up front.

3376
02:11:44.458 --> 02:11:46.715  
ASHLEY: ♪ In the year 2525 ♪

3377
02:11:48.381 --> 02:11:50.581  
MATT: All right and 20 for Keyleth.

3378
02:11:52.822 --> 02:11:53.905  
All right.

3379
02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:55.146  
20 to 15.

3380
02:11:56.131 --> 02:11:57.519  
TRAVIS: Grog got an 18.

3381
02:11:57.519 --> 02:11:59.468  
SAM: Wow, with disadvantage,

3382
02:11:59.468 --> 02:12:00.611  
that's amazing.
ASHLEY: I got a 16.

3383
02:12:00.611 --> 02:12:02.195  
MATT: Oh shit!

3384
02:12:02.195 --> 02:12:03.058  
LIAM: Who are you?

3385
02:12:03.058 --> 02:12:03.891  
ASHLEY: I know!

3386
02:12:03.891 --> 02:12:04.908  
TRAVIS: Why disadvantage?

3387
02:12:04.908 --> 02:12:06.991  
SAM: You're exhausted.

3388
02:12:06.991 --> 02:12:10.061  
TRAVIS: Oh wait, do I got to roll--?

3389
02:12:10.061 --> 02:12:11.894  
MATT: All right, 15 to ten.

3390
02:12:13.421 --> 02:12:14.879  
LIAM: 13.
SAM: 13.

3391
02:12:14.879 --> 02:12:16.350  
TRAVIS: On one point of exhaustion,

3392
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:17.954  
you roll a disadvantage on initiative?

3393
02:12:17.954 --> 02:12:18.912  
MATT: Yep.

3394
02:12:18.912 --> 02:12:20.170  
TRAVIS: Fuck.

3395
02:12:23.459 --> 02:12:25.244  
MATT: All right.

3396
02:12:25.244 --> 02:12:26.578  
Ten to five.

3397
02:12:28.981 --> 02:12:30.981  
TRAVIS: Bertrand rolled an 11.

3398
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:34.559  
LAURA: Wouldn't he roll like double disadvantage?

3399
02:12:34.559 --> 02:12:37.133  
MATT: No such thing. It's just disadvantage.

3400
02:12:37.133 --> 02:12:39.266  
LIAM: What about triple disadvantage, though?

3401
02:12:39.266 --> 02:12:40.787  
TALIESIN: Yep, that's real, that's real.

3402
02:12:40.787 --> 02:12:42.374  
MATT: All right, I think that's the full set there.

3403
02:12:42.374 --> 02:12:44.175  
Top of the combat round,

3404
02:12:44.175 --> 02:12:45.515  
we have Percy and Vex,

3405
02:12:45.515 --> 02:12:47.515  
what are you guys doing?
SAM: Yay, D&D!

3406
02:12:48.598 --> 02:12:51.209
TRAVIS: Shit, this is going to suck.

3407
02:12:51.209 --> 02:12:53.864  
I'm going to see it crash through the wall,

3408
02:12:53.864 --> 02:12:55.715  
I'm going to cast Hex on it, first of all.

3409
02:12:55.715 --> 02:12:59.473  
MATT: All right, the creature is now hexed.

3410
02:13:01.666 --> 02:13:03.790  
LIAM: The hex do you mean?

3411
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:05.504  
SAM: Oh, it's got a cute little bracelet.

3412
02:13:05.504 --> 02:13:08.794  
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to--

3413
02:13:08.794 --> 02:13:10.252  
SAM: Do that again.

3414
02:13:10.252 --> 02:13:12.954  
You got to keep doing that.

3415
02:13:12.954 --> 02:13:16.517  
TALIESIN: And it's a GIF. I'm going to talk to Bob

3416
02:13:16.517 --> 02:13:19.431  
and I'm going to grab Bob by the shoulders.

3417
02:13:19.431 --> 02:13:21.927  
We really could use some help. Please help us.

3418
02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:23.730  
We have to deal with this. I'll be back.

3419
02:13:23.730 --> 02:13:25.443  
And I'm going to run into that corner.

3420
02:13:25.443 --> 02:13:27.903  
I'm going to get as far as I can into that corner

3421
02:13:27.903 --> 02:13:30.236  
to get away from this thing.

3422
02:13:31.331 --> 02:13:33.196  
Yeah, that's as far as I can--

3423
02:13:33.196 --> 02:13:34.346  
MATT: As far as you can get there.

3424
02:13:34.346 --> 02:13:37.957  
TALIESIN: There's no way to get cover from this thing.

3425
02:13:37.957 --> 02:13:39.671  
MATT: You can get, like--

3426
02:13:39.671 --> 02:13:41.322  
TALIESIN: Whatever cover I can get.

3427
02:13:41.322 --> 02:13:43.061  
MATT: Not so much.

3428
02:13:43.061 --> 02:13:45.928  
SAM: He doesn't have anything that he can throw at us.

3429
02:13:45.928 --> 02:13:47.652  
You'll be fine.

3430
02:13:49.304 --> 02:13:50.550  
TALIESIN: Yes, darling.

3431
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:52.767  
LAURA: Oh me.
MATT: Is that your turn?

3432
02:13:52.767 --> 02:13:55.480  
TALIESIN: That's my bonus, my action, and my, yeah.

3433
02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.974  
LAURA: Okay.

3434
02:13:56.974 --> 02:13:58.491  
How's the wind in this area?

3435
02:13:58.491 --> 02:13:59.665  
Just as bad?
MATT: Strong.

3436
02:13:59.665 --> 02:14:01.165  
LAURA: Okay, cool.

3437
02:14:03.102 --> 02:14:04.218  
MATT: Not quite as bad as the top of the tower,

3438
02:14:04.218 --> 02:14:05.551  
but it's still bad.

3439
02:14:05.551 --> 02:14:07.171  
Where you're standing, it's a little rough.

3440
02:14:07.171 --> 02:14:08.956  
As soon as you get above five feet,

3441
02:14:08.956 --> 02:14:10.842  
it starts getting pretty rough.

3442
02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:13.355  
LAURA: I'm going to take off running towards the corner

3443
02:14:13.355 --> 02:14:15.605  
where the Locate Object is.

3444
02:14:16.568 --> 02:14:19.348  
I'm going to follow my instincts.

3445
02:14:19.348 --> 02:14:20.391  
MATT: All righty.

3446
02:14:20.391 --> 02:14:23.694  
LAURA: Can I sense where it's coming from still?

3447
02:14:23.694 --> 02:14:26.797  
MATT: You can sense the direction is probably this way

3448
02:14:26.797 --> 02:14:28.588  
and up a bit.

3449
02:14:32.656 --> 02:14:35.384  
LAURA: Okay. Can I--

3450
02:14:35.384 --> 02:14:36.649  
MARISHA: It's got to be up on the second floor.

3451
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:38.515  
LAURA: Can I kick up on my broom?

3452
02:14:38.515 --> 02:14:39.891
MATT: Sure, yeah.

3453
02:14:39.891 --> 02:14:42.624  
So you hop up onto your broom.

3454
02:14:44.691 --> 02:14:45.524
And?

3455
02:14:46.817 --> 02:14:48.323  
You've used your movement,

3456
02:14:48.323 --> 02:14:49.398  
so you can use your action and dash

3457
02:14:49.398 --> 02:14:50.373  
if you want with your broom.

3458
02:14:50.373 --> 02:14:53.181  
LAURA: Could I get up to the top and hop off the broom

3459
02:14:53.181 --> 02:14:54.457  
as soon as I'm up on a higher level?

3460
02:14:54.457 --> 02:14:55.883  
MATT: We'll find out.

3461
02:14:55.883 --> 02:14:57.291
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3462
02:14:57.291 --> 02:14:58.160
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try.

3463
02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:01.993  
MATT: Okay, so you're up on the broom

3464
02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:03.682  
and you begin to coast your way upward.

3465
02:15:03.682 --> 02:15:08.106  
I need you to go ahead and--

3466
02:15:08.106 --> 02:15:09.631
<v ->- this be?</v>

3467
02:15:10.514 --> 02:15:13.464  
Because this is trying to resist.

3468
02:15:16.422 --> 02:15:18.612  
SAM: Don't lose your hat.

3469
02:15:18.612 --> 02:15:22.299  
MATT: There is the hat aspect of it there.

3470
02:15:22.299 --> 02:15:25.060  
I would say this is trying to keep and maintain

3471
02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:28.218  
the direction of the broom against the wind that's pushing.

3472
02:15:28.218 --> 02:15:29.507  
So it would be an athletics check.

3473
02:15:29.507 --> 02:15:30.507  
LAURA: Athletics.

3474
02:15:31.624 --> 02:15:34.457  
Great, not strength, but athletics.

3475
02:15:35.557 --> 02:15:36.997  
Just a regular old roll,

3476
02:15:36.997 --> 02:15:39.283  
athletics?
MATT: Yep.

3477
02:15:39.283 --> 02:15:41.616  
LAURA: Oh, 19.

3478
02:15:41.616 --> 02:15:42.980  
MATT: 19?

3479
02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:46.190  
You do manage to as you dash,

3480
02:15:46.190 --> 02:15:48.389  
get up and on top there.

3481
02:15:48.389 --> 02:15:51.474
LAURA: Yes!
SAM: Nice flying!

3482
02:15:51.474 --> 02:15:52.724
TRAVIS: Nicely done!

3483
02:15:52.724 --> 02:15:54.686  
MATT: So that's your other action.

3484
02:15:54.686 --> 02:15:56.519  
LAURA: Bonus action,

3485
02:15:56.519 --> 02:15:58.819  
I'm going to... (laughs)

3486
02:16:00.016 --> 02:16:01.183  
Hunter's Mark.

3487
02:16:02.078 --> 02:16:06.344  
MATT: Hunter's Mark. What's the range on Hunter's Mark?

3488
02:16:06.344 --> 02:16:07.827  
LAURA: What?

3489
02:16:07.827 --> 02:16:08.660  
TALIESIN: It's been awhile.

3490
02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:09.915
MATT: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

3491
02:16:09.915 --> 02:16:12.162
ASHLEY: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

3492
02:16:12.162 --> 02:16:14.657  
LAURA: Player's Handbook? Player's Handbook, anyone?

3493
02:16:14.657 --> 02:16:16.179  
MATT: I got you, Hunter's Mark, 90 feet.

3494
02:16:16.179 --> 02:16:17.348  
LAURA: 90 feet, 90 feet.

3495
02:16:17.348 --> 02:16:19.141  
TALIESIN: He's got disadvantage on strength checks.

3496
02:16:19.141 --> 02:16:20.258  
MATT: Sure.

3497
02:16:20.258 --> 02:16:21.708  
TRAVIS: The big fuck?

3498
02:16:22.747 --> 02:16:23.730
LAURA: Dope.

3499
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:25.589
MATT: Here we go.

3500
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:28.219  
LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket

3501
02:16:28.219 --> 02:16:31.535  
run and stand...

3502
02:16:33.839 --> 02:16:35.224  
next to...

3503
02:16:35.224 --> 02:16:38.333  
run towards my husband.

3504
02:16:41.307 --> 02:16:43.755  
Oh, Bertrand's still on his back.

3505
02:16:43.755 --> 02:16:48.005  
MATT: Yeah, Bertrand's like (yelping).

3506
02:16:49.512 --> 02:16:51.929  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) This fucking horse is huge.

3507
02:16:53.552 --> 02:16:54.802  
LAURA: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Hey, Boo Boo!

3508
02:16:55.752 --> 02:16:56.984
ASHLEY: Hey, Boo Boo!

3509
02:16:56.984 --> 02:16:58.934
LAURA: I can't duck?

3510
02:16:58.934 --> 02:17:00.861  
Can I crouch or something?

3511
02:17:00.861 --> 02:17:02.120  
Is there anything to hold onto?

3512
02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:03.412  
MATT: You can drop prone, if you want.

3513
02:17:03.412 --> 02:17:04.245  
LAURA: Can I what?

3514
02:17:04.245 --> 02:17:06.138  
MATT: Drop prone.

3515
02:17:06.138 --> 02:17:07.466  
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to drop prone

3516
02:17:07.466 --> 02:17:10.605  
because ranged gets a disadvantage on prone.

3517
02:17:10.605 --> 02:17:12.659  
MATT: You are correct.

3518
02:17:12.659 --> 02:17:14.951  
That ends your go. Keyleth, you're up.

3519
02:17:14.951 --> 02:17:16.406  
MARISHA: I'm going to--

3520
02:17:16.406 --> 02:17:19.681  
it's probably a little useless, but it might slow him down.

3521
02:17:19.681 --> 02:17:21.074  
I'm going to turn around,

3522
02:17:21.074 --> 02:17:23.243  
and I'm going to start backing up towards

3523
02:17:23.243 --> 02:17:25.803  
the direction of Vex and, as I'm backing up,

3524
02:17:25.803 --> 02:17:30.300  
I'm going to throw up a Wall of Stone in front of this guy

3525
02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:31.837  
and around this way

3526
02:17:31.837 --> 02:17:34.240  
and try and block him out for a minute.

3527
02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.258  
MATT: Okay, we'll say using this as stone.

3528
02:17:38.258 --> 02:17:40.881  
TALIESIN: Fortress of Solitude stone.

3529
02:17:40.881 --> 02:17:44.412  
MARISHA: I back up and then I punch the ground with my fist

3530
02:17:44.412 --> 02:17:46.038  
and you just see--

3531
02:17:46.038 --> 02:17:47.621  
MATT: Like there?

3532
02:17:47.621 --> 02:17:49.540  
MARISHA: -- earth. Yeah.
MATT: Okay, cool.

3533
02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:53.790  
MARISHA: How much-- Player's Handbook!

3534
02:17:54.985 --> 02:17:57.443  
Why do we only have one?

3535
02:17:57.443 --> 02:17:59.860  
We're a company built on D&D.

3536
02:18:00.948 --> 02:18:02.763  
TALIESIN: What levels? I'm in cleric spells. Hold on.

3537
02:18:02.763 --> 02:18:06.204  
MATT: I think it's a 4th-level, right? Wall of Stone?

3538
02:18:06.204 --> 02:18:07.380  
MARISHA: Fifth.

3539
02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.205  
MATT: 5th-level.
LIAM: Well-oiled machine, we are.

3540
02:18:09.205 --> 02:18:10.124  
MATT: I know.

3541
02:18:10.124 --> 02:18:12.649  
MARISHA: I just want to see how long it can be.

3542
02:18:12.649 --> 02:18:14.648
It might be able to be longer, but we can keep going.

3543
02:18:14.648 --> 02:18:18.217  
MATT: Okay. How far back are you going to move?

3544
02:18:18.217 --> 02:18:21.555  
MARISHA: My movement towards the direction of Vex.

3545
02:18:21.555 --> 02:18:22.859  
MATT: There you go.

3546
02:18:22.859 --> 02:18:24.389  
LAURA: Ah man, okay, well--

3547
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:25.222  
LIAM: What's the spell?

3548
02:18:25.222 --> 02:18:26.575  
5th-level.

3549
02:18:26.575 --> 02:18:27.748  
LAURA: Try not to clump.

3550
02:18:27.748 --> 02:18:28.989  
How about we don't clump?

3551
02:18:28.989 --> 02:18:30.692  
How about, everyone, we don't clump?

3552
02:18:30.692 --> 02:18:32.034  
MARISHA: Ten--

3553
02:18:32.034 --> 02:18:32.867
LAURA: (pigeon cooing)

3554
02:18:34.125 --> 02:18:35.834
MARISHA: Ten, ten-foot panels.

3555
02:18:35.834 --> 02:18:38.327  
So it can be 100-foot wall

3556
02:18:38.327 --> 02:18:41.623  
that I want to loop around and block him out

3557
02:18:41.623 --> 02:18:42.908  
as much as I can.
MATT: Loop around here

3558
02:18:42.908 --> 02:18:43.853  
you mean like--?

3559
02:18:43.853 --> 02:18:46.731  
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Keyleth, don't clump.

3560
02:18:46.731 --> 02:18:48.898  
MATT: She's already moved.
LAURA: Damn it.

3561
02:18:50.414 --> 02:18:53.178  
MATT: All right, that finishes Keyleth's go?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3562
02:18:53.178 --> 02:18:54.815  
All right, end of Keyleth's turn.

3563
02:18:54.815 --> 02:18:55.999  
It is Bob's turn.

3564
02:18:55.999 --> 02:18:56.832  
Bob,

3565
02:18:58.493 --> 02:19:00.093
turns and goes,

3566
02:19:00.093 --> 02:19:02.063  
"Right, the presents. Let me go look."

3567
02:19:02.063 --> 02:19:03.430  
He's going to head this way

3568
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:05.562  
and start rummaging through his stuff in his desk

3569
02:19:05.562 --> 02:19:07.677  
and his shelves there

3570
02:19:07.677 --> 02:19:10.723  
for what you're asking about.

3571
02:19:10.723 --> 02:19:12.640  
That finishes his turn.

3572
02:19:14.308 --> 02:19:16.188  
Grog, you're up.

3573
02:19:16.188 --> 02:19:20.836  
TRAVIS: Um, uh, y'all go find stuff, right?

3574
02:19:20.836 --> 02:19:23.884  
I'll sit here and guard the wall.

3575
02:19:23.884 --> 02:19:26.560  
I will about face.

3576
02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:27.393  
LAURA: Oh god.

3577
02:19:28.525 --> 02:19:32.067  
TRAVIS: I will smash through the-- no, I'm just kidding.

3578
02:19:32.067 --> 02:19:34.347  
Can I bang with my bonus action

3579
02:19:34.347 --> 02:19:36.248  
and use the Titanstone Knuckles?

3580
02:19:36.248 --> 02:19:37.081  
MATT: Yes, you can.

3581
02:19:37.081 --> 02:19:38.383  
And I'm going to remember to go get that thing again.

3582
02:19:38.383 --> 02:19:40.225  
I'll be right back.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3583
02:19:40.225 --> 02:19:41.610  
Here's the Player's Handbook.

3584
02:19:41.610 --> 02:19:45.134  
LIAM: Quick, just throw the big one off the table.

3585
02:19:45.134 --> 02:19:47.260  
SAM: We don't have a sponsor tonight, guys.

3586
02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:48.202  
But here it goes.

3587
02:19:48.202 --> 02:19:49.540  
TALIESIN: The sponsor is the power

3588
02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:50.549  
of friendship.
SAM: Thank you

3589
02:19:50.549 --> 02:19:52.753  
for all of the supporters.

3590
02:19:52.753 --> 02:19:55.985
TALIESIN: Yeah! Thank you guys so much here!

3591
02:19:55.985 --> 02:19:57.609  
SAM: Thank you for supporting our Kickstarter

3592
02:19:57.609 --> 02:20:00.177  
and getting us to this point.

3593
02:20:00.177 --> 02:20:02.662  
LAURA: We beat him!

3594
02:20:02.662 --> 02:20:06.422  
SAM: Thanks for helping us raise (mumbles) dollars

3595
02:20:06.422 --> 02:20:08.671  
towards the amazing animated series

3596
02:20:08.671 --> 02:20:10.737  
and for unlocking this

3597
02:20:10.737 --> 02:20:12.224  
and many other stretch goals.

3598
02:20:12.224 --> 02:20:15.955  
Can't wait to see you in the DM chair, Ashley J.

3599
02:20:15.955 --> 02:20:16.872  
ASHLEY: Boy, boy.

3600
02:20:18.426 --> 02:20:19.709
(retching)

3601
02:20:20.809 --> 02:20:21.980  
LAURA: You're going to be great.

3602
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:22.971  
It's going to be great.

3603
02:20:22.971 --> 02:20:23.804  
SAM: Have you ever done it before?

3604
02:20:23.804 --> 02:20:25.904  
ASHLEY: Never in my life, and I am--

3605
02:20:25.904 --> 02:20:27.281
LIAM: It's going to be the best, then.
ASHLEY: -- terrified.

3606
02:20:27.281 --> 02:20:28.164
TALIESIN: Never have I ever.

3607
02:20:28.164 --> 02:20:31.030  
ASHLEY: Yeah, just the best for your first time to DM

3608
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:33.834  
to be on camera in front of a bunch of people.

3609
02:20:33.834 --> 02:20:35.108  
TALIESIN: So we've got these wolves--

3610
02:20:35.108 --> 02:20:36.215  
LIAM: I have found the internet

3611
02:20:36.215 --> 02:20:37.687  
to be a very forgiving place.

3612
02:20:37.687 --> 02:20:39.699  
ASHLEY: Oh sure.

3613
02:20:39.699 --> 02:20:40.532  
Sure.

3614
02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:42.958  
MARISHA and TALIESIN: The wolves at you.

3615
02:20:42.958 --> 02:20:44.217
MATT: [off-camera] The original one I used.

3616
02:20:44.217 --> 02:20:45.639  
ASHLEY: It's okay.
SAM: Matt is just gone.

3617
02:20:45.639 --> 02:20:47.980  
MATT: We're just making you into a--

3618
02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:49.930  
sure, you'll be an ice giant for this one.

3619
02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:51.687  
TALIESIN: For a moment, I thought that was

3620
02:20:51.687 --> 02:20:53.370  
a hockey player. I was so excited.

3621
02:20:53.370 --> 02:20:54.944  
TRAVIS: Coming up in the world.

3622
02:20:54.944 --> 02:20:56.194  
MATT: There you go.

3623
02:20:57.028 --> 02:20:58.061  
Bonus action.

3624
02:20:58.061 --> 02:21:01.028  
TRAVIS: Yes, I will hold my--

3625
02:21:01.028 --> 02:21:03.276  
I would like to rage.

3626
02:21:03.276 --> 02:21:05.047  
MATT: You cannot. It's a bonus action to rage.

3627
02:21:05.047 --> 02:21:06.684  
TRAVIS: So I will hold my attack

3628
02:21:06.684 --> 02:21:09.759  
for if the giant Kris Kringle

3629
02:21:09.759 --> 02:21:12.057  
gets in my attack range.

3630
02:21:12.057 --> 02:21:13.571  
MATT: You got it. That ends your turn.

3631
02:21:13.571 --> 02:21:14.719  
Pike.

3632
02:21:14.719 --> 02:21:16.025  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

3633
02:21:16.025 --> 02:21:19.960  
I can't do any spells unless I have my shit.

3634
02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:23.727  
So I'm going to move over to

3635
02:21:23.727 --> 02:21:27.844
a little bit underneath where Vex is.

3636
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:29.818  
See how far I can get

3637
02:21:29.818 --> 02:21:30.651  
over there.
MATT: 25.

3638
02:21:30.651 --> 02:21:31.484  
That's as far as you can get there.

3639
02:21:31.484 --> 02:21:33.467  
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm all lopsided.

3640
02:21:33.467 --> 02:21:35.134  
Yeah, can I go more,

3641
02:21:38.239 --> 02:21:42.878  
can I go more to the just a little to the right?

3642
02:21:42.878 --> 02:21:45.093  
Yeah, just so I'm not lopsided.

3643
02:21:45.093 --> 02:21:47.051  
I know we're still clumped.

3644
02:21:47.051 --> 02:21:48.142  
And...

3645
02:21:50.167 --> 02:21:52.442
oh boy.

3646
02:21:52.442 --> 02:21:56.826  
TRAVIS: Oh boy, oh boy, yeah.

3647
02:22:02.390 --> 02:22:04.805
ASHLEY: Okay.

3648
02:22:04.805 --> 02:22:06.241  
That's going to be my move.

3649
02:22:06.241 --> 02:22:08.497  
MATT: Yep, that's your move.
ASHLEY: I can't do anything yet.

3650
02:22:08.497 --> 02:22:10.350  
MATT: Action, anything?

3651
02:22:10.350 --> 02:22:11.806  
ASHLEY: That's my move.

3652
02:22:11.806 --> 02:22:15.261  
MATT: You're not going to do an action?

3653
02:22:15.261 --> 02:22:17.054  
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's really dumb.

3654
02:22:17.054 --> 02:22:18.424  
MATT: I'm saying, you can cast a spell

3655
02:22:18.424 --> 02:22:20.177  
or you can use your action to move further.

3656
02:22:20.177 --> 02:22:21.752  
It's up to you.
LAURA: You could a buffing--

3657
02:22:21.752 --> 02:22:23.466  
ASHLEY: But we don't have all of our stuff.

3658
02:22:23.466 --> 02:22:24.549  
LAURA: Some things don't need--

3659
02:22:24.549 --> 02:22:25.914  
that's only if it's

3660
02:22:25.914 --> 02:22:26.821  
a monetary--
MATT: Certain spells

3661
02:22:26.821 --> 02:22:27.948  
require monetary components.

3662
02:22:27.948 --> 02:22:29.776  
Most of them are things you'll have on you.

3663
02:22:29.776 --> 02:22:33.468  
LAURA: Like Beacon of Hope doesn't need a monetary, does it?

3664
02:22:33.468 --> 02:22:34.893  
TALIESIN: No.

3665
02:22:36.345 --> 02:22:37.723
MARISHA: You still have your focus.

3666
02:22:37.723 --> 02:22:39.551  
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do Beacon of Hope.

3667
02:22:39.551 --> 02:22:40.478  
Sorry, I'm panicking.

3668
02:22:40.478 --> 02:22:42.032  
I'll cast Beacon of Hope.

3669
02:22:42.032 --> 02:22:42.923  
MATT: All right.

3670
02:22:42.923 --> 02:22:44.766  
So you're choosing--

3671
02:22:44.766 --> 02:22:45.599
TALIESIN: We've all been there.

3672
02:22:48.205 --> 02:22:50.113  
MATT: Okay. So Beacon of Hope.

3673
02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:53.787  
All right, any creatures within range, 30 feet of you.

3674
02:22:53.787 --> 02:22:58.112  
That would be Vex, Percy,

3675
02:22:58.112 --> 02:23:00.912
Trinket, Bertrand, Keyleth,

3676
02:23:00.912 --> 02:23:02.318  
Scanlan, and yourself.

3677
02:23:02.318 --> 02:23:05.452  
So Lieve'tel is out. Grog is out.

3678
02:23:05.452 --> 02:23:07.122  
ASHLEY: Sorry, Grog.

3679
02:23:07.122 --> 02:23:10.060  
MATT: Actually, no, you can get Grog in the range, 30 feet.

3680
02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:12.172  
TALIESIN: What does that give you?

3681
02:23:12.172 --> 02:23:13.005  
MATT: Advantage on wisdom saving throws,

3682
02:23:13.005 --> 02:23:13.991
which you already have,

3683
02:23:13.991 --> 02:23:14.824  
and death saving throws

3684
02:23:14.824 --> 02:23:17.248  
and you regain the max number of hit points possible

3685
02:23:17.248 --> 02:23:18.850  
from any healing you gain.

3686
02:23:18.850 --> 02:23:19.683  
LAURA: That's good.

3687
02:23:19.683 --> 02:23:21.959  
SAM: That lasts even if we leave that 30-foot radius?

3688
02:23:21.959 --> 02:23:24.175  
MATT: Correct. It is concentration,

3689
02:23:24.175 --> 02:23:25.375  
so keep that in mind.

3690
02:23:25.375 --> 02:23:26.668  
That ends your turn, Pike?

3691
02:23:26.668 --> 02:23:28.568  
ASHLEY: Yep.
MATT: End of your turn,

3692
02:23:28.568 --> 02:23:30.384
it's going to use two legendary actions

3693
02:23:30.384 --> 02:23:32.198  
to shift form.

3694
02:23:32.198 --> 02:23:33.867  
SAM: Shift form?

3695
02:23:33.867 --> 02:23:36.921  
But it's already so big and imposing.

3696
02:23:36.921 --> 02:23:40.036  
MARISHA: Oh, damn it.
LAURA: Oh shit.

3697
02:23:40.036 --> 02:23:41.786  
SAM: What's it becoming?

3698
02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:44.379  
TRAVIS: Oh no.

3699
02:23:44.379 --> 02:23:47.660  
Nope, that is not cool.

3700
02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:48.685
LAURA: (lisping) He is a cyclone.

3701
02:23:48.685 --> 02:23:50.314
He is a cyclone.

3702
02:23:50.314 --> 02:23:52.350  
MATT: You watch as the hardened dust form

3703
02:23:52.350 --> 02:23:55.970  
cracks and turns to a cyclone of dust.

3704
02:23:55.970 --> 02:23:59.537  
It (wind whistling). How tall is the stone?

3705
02:24:00.951 --> 02:24:03.331  
MARISHA: I think it's--

3706
02:24:03.331 --> 02:24:05.601
it's tall.

3707
02:24:05.601 --> 02:24:07.184  
You had it up.

3708
02:24:07.184 --> 02:24:10.221  
TALIESIN: You can do ten-foot or ten-foot by 20-foot.

3709
02:24:10.221 --> 02:24:11.446  
MARISHA: 20 feet tall.

3710
02:24:12.353 --> 02:24:13.561  
20 feet?

3711
02:24:13.561 --> 02:24:15.028  
MATT: Ten-foot by ten-foot and how long?

3712
02:24:15.028 --> 02:24:17.391  
TALIESIN: It can be ten-foot by ten-foot, six inches thick,

3713
02:24:17.391 --> 02:24:19.266  
ten panels, each panel is contiguous

3714
02:24:19.266 --> 02:24:20.189  
with at least one other panel, or you can create

3715
02:24:20.189 --> 02:24:24.847  
ten-foot by 20-foot panels that are only three inches thick.

3716
02:24:24.847 --> 02:24:25.680  
MARISHA: Right.

3717
02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:27.199  
LAURA: So it's only ten feet tall.

3718
02:24:27.199 --> 02:24:28.895  
MATT: Ten feet tall is what you said.

3719
02:24:28.895 --> 02:24:30.291  
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's ten feet tall.

3720
02:24:30.291 --> 02:24:31.124  
So...

3721
02:24:31.999 --> 02:24:33.548  
It uses five feet of movement,

3722
02:24:33.548 --> 02:24:35.696  
traveling over barely.

3723
02:24:35.696 --> 02:24:37.863  
It gets to move 60 feet in this form

3724
02:24:37.863 --> 02:24:39.234  
and travel through people.

3725
02:24:39.234 --> 02:24:40.423  
So Grog, you get in attack.

3726
02:24:40.423 --> 02:24:41.256  
TRAVIS: Sure.

3727
02:24:41.256 --> 02:24:42.309  
LAURA: On wind!

3728
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:43.171
TRAVIS: Yep.

3729
02:24:43.171 --> 02:24:46.229  
SAM: Break the wind, Grog. Break it.

3730
02:24:46.229 --> 02:24:48.187  
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

3731
02:24:48.187 --> 02:24:49.928  
26.

3732
02:24:52.748 --> 02:24:56.897  
MATT: It is now in Pike's space and Keyleth's space.

3733
02:24:56.897 --> 02:24:58.560
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

3734
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.285  
LIAM: Is Pike in the tumble dryer?
ASHLEY: Great choices.

3735
02:25:01.285 --> 02:25:02.580  
MATT: Grog, making your attack
TRAVIS: 26 to hit.

3736
02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:04.696  
That hits. You can go roll damage.

3737
02:25:07.996 --> 02:25:08.829  
TRAVIS: 23...

3738
02:25:15.454 --> 02:25:17.059  
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

3739
02:25:17.059 --> 02:25:20.665  
Where's the little fucking caltrop?

3740
02:25:20.665 --> 02:25:21.498  
29.

3741
02:25:21.498 --> 02:25:23.101  
29 points of slashing damage

3742
02:25:23.101 --> 02:25:24.763  
with some necrotic thrown in there

3743
02:25:24.763 --> 02:25:27.513  
at large.
MATT: How much is the necrotic?

3744
02:25:27.513 --> 02:25:28.471  
TRAVIS: Three points.

3745
02:25:28.471 --> 02:25:30.990  
MATT: Okay, so 26 points of slashing?

3746
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:32.274  
TRAVIS: 26 points of slashing,

3747
02:25:32.274 --> 02:25:33.232  
three of necrotic.

3748
02:25:33.232 --> 02:25:34.065  
MATT: You hack through

3749
02:25:34.065 --> 02:25:37.399  
and it seems to not be doing as much damage

3750
02:25:37.399 --> 02:25:38.691  
as you're used to with those strikes.

3751
02:25:38.691 --> 02:25:40.112  
Its form seems to be resistant

3752
02:25:40.112 --> 02:25:42.708  
or hard to really carve through.

3753
02:25:42.708 --> 02:25:46.516  
It seems to be taking less damage than you expected.

3754
02:25:46.516 --> 02:25:48.076
TRAVIS: Big problem.

3755
02:25:48.076 --> 02:25:49.996  
MATT: Plus three necrotic.

3756
02:25:49.996 --> 02:25:51.305  
All right, that's your strike.

3757
02:25:51.305 --> 02:25:52.148  
It moves past you.

3758
02:25:52.148 --> 02:25:54.882  
As it does, its storm tears past you

3759
02:25:54.882 --> 02:25:59.059  
burning with this endless pelting of pebbles and stones,

3760
02:25:59.059 --> 02:26:01.291  
like tiny little glass daggers through your skin.

3761
02:26:01.291 --> 02:26:04.994  
To you and Scanlan and Pike and Keyleth.

3762
02:26:04.994 --> 02:26:06.640  
I need you all to make dexterity saving throws, please.

3763
02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:07.698  
SAM: Oh shit.

3764
02:26:07.698 --> 02:26:09.414
TRAVIS: I get advantage on that.

3765
02:26:10.356 --> 02:26:12.191  
TRAVIS: But I have a point of exhaustion,

3766
02:26:12.191 --> 02:26:14.883  
which means that's at disadvantage right?

3767
02:26:14.883 --> 02:26:16.220  
MATT: No, it's physical.

3768
02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:18.921  
TRAVIS: One point of exhaustion, disadvantage on saving throws.

3769
02:26:18.921 --> 02:26:21.610  
MATT: No, three points is disadvantage on savings throws.

3770
02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:23.392  
Ability checks, you have one.

3771
02:26:23.392 --> 02:26:24.225  
SAM: 20.

3772
02:26:24.225 --> 02:26:26.107  
MATT: 20, that's a success.

3773
02:26:26.107 --> 02:26:26.940  
MARISHA: Nine.

3774
02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:27.773  
MATT: Failure.

3775
02:26:27.773 --> 02:26:28.795  
TRAVIS: Dexterity?

3776
02:26:28.795 --> 02:26:30.040  
ASHLEY: 16.

3777
02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:31.448  
MATT: 16, failure.

3778
02:26:31.448 --> 02:26:33.255  
TRAVIS: Dexterity? 23.

3779
02:26:33.255 --> 02:26:34.088  
MATT: Success.

3780
02:26:34.088 --> 02:26:35.470  
So Grog and Scanlan

3781
02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:39.598  
both take 16 points of piercing damage.

3782
02:26:39.598 --> 02:26:43.019  
Keyleth and Pike take 32 points of piercing damage.

3783
02:26:43.019 --> 02:26:43.852  
MATT: Say again?

3784
02:26:43.852 --> 02:26:45.580  
MATT: You take 32 points of piercing damage

3785
02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:48.591  
as it blasts through you, striking into you.

3786
02:26:48.591 --> 02:26:49.961  
The storm just seems to envelop

3787
02:26:49.961 --> 02:26:51.185  
and slam across you,

3788
02:26:51.185 --> 02:26:54.443  
like you're being stung by 1,000 bees at once.

3789
02:26:55.310 --> 02:26:56.500
SAM: Bees.

3790
02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:57.778  
LAURA: Is that magical?

3791
02:26:57.778 --> 02:26:59.561  
ASHLEY: I'm resistant to piercing, but is this--?

3792
02:26:59.561 --> 02:27:00.991  
MATT: It is not magical.

3793
02:27:00.991 --> 02:27:03.156  
ASHLEY: This is non-magical, so I would have it?

3794
02:27:03.156 --> 02:27:04.678  
MATT: What gives you resistance from piercing?

3795
02:27:04.678 --> 02:27:06.866  
ASHLEY: Avatar of Battle.

3796
02:27:06.866 --> 02:27:08.265  
MATT: Then yeah, you would take half that.

3797
02:27:08.265 --> 02:27:09.098  
So you take 16.

3798
02:27:09.098 --> 02:27:10.664  
SAM: (Midwestern accent) The Avatar of Battle.

3799
02:27:10.664 --> 02:27:11.984
ASHLEY: (Midwestern accent) The Avatar of Battle.

3800
02:27:11.984 --> 02:27:13.612  
TALIESIN: Nice, that works out.

3801
02:27:13.612 --> 02:27:16.312  
MATT: You do have to make a concentration saving throw

3802
02:27:16.312 --> 02:27:17.737  
because you are concentrating the spell.

3803
02:27:17.737 --> 02:27:19.505  
TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance

3804
02:27:19.505 --> 02:27:21.391  
to reduce the damage?

3805
02:27:21.391 --> 02:27:22.224  
MATT: You can.

3806
02:27:22.224 --> 02:27:24.965  
TRAVIS: Okay, I only get to use it once.

3807
02:27:24.965 --> 02:27:26.273
1d12...

3808
02:27:27.828 --> 02:27:29.922  
Plus my constitution modifier.

3809
02:27:29.922 --> 02:27:30.755  
Four plus...

3810
02:27:32.303 --> 02:27:33.136  
the fuck?

3811
02:27:33.136 --> 02:27:34.386  
Oh, two, so six.

3812
02:27:35.345 --> 02:27:37.272  
Eight points reduced.

3813
02:27:37.272 --> 02:27:38.452  
MATT: Take that down.

3814
02:27:38.452 --> 02:27:39.285  
ASHLEY: 16.

3815
02:27:39.285 --> 02:27:40.404  
MATT: You rolled a 16?

3816
02:27:40.404 --> 02:27:42.319  
Yes, you maintain concentration, no worries.

3817
02:27:42.319 --> 02:27:43.480  
Now it's going to make its actions.

3818
02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:45.530  
It makes two slam attacks.

3819
02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:46.363  
LIAM: Pike and anybody else?

3820
02:27:46.363 --> 02:27:47.844  
MATT: It's going to go after Keyleth

3821
02:27:47.844 --> 02:27:49.165  
and it's going to go after Pike,

3822
02:27:49.165 --> 02:27:51.432  
since they're both closest to it at the moment.

3823
02:27:51.432 --> 02:27:52.657  
TALIESIN: Didn't hurt--
LIAM: These two.

3824
02:27:52.657 --> 02:27:54.906
LAURA: No, it hit Keyleth, Pike, and Grog.

3825
02:27:54.906 --> 02:27:58.434  
MATT: Against Keyleth that is going to be 36 to hit.

3826
02:27:58.434 --> 02:27:59.826  
SAM: Oh shit.

3827
02:27:59.826 --> 02:28:01.026  
MATT: And against Pike--

3828
02:28:01.026 --> 02:28:02.080  
TRAVIS: Did you say 36?

3829
02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:02.913  
MATT: Yes.

3830
02:28:02.913 --> 02:28:05.466  
That's going to be 28 to hit.

3831
02:28:05.466 --> 02:28:06.876  
TALIESIN: It's a storm.

3832
02:28:06.876 --> 02:28:08.576  
It's going to be hard to miss.

3833
02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:11.650  
ASHLEY: I think that hits.

3834
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:12.763  
TRAVIS: So a lot of dice it's rolling.

3835
02:28:12.763 --> 02:28:15.985  
SAM: They're all sixes, it's fine.

3836
02:28:15.985 --> 02:28:17.355  
TRAVIS: Let's talk to it.

3837
02:28:17.355 --> 02:28:18.880  
TALIESIN: Remember heals. You don't roll for heals.

3838
02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.044  
It's max healing for anything you do, by the way.

3839
02:28:21.044 --> 02:28:21.877  
ASHLEY: Got it, okay.

3840
02:28:21.877 --> 02:28:22.710  
TALIESIN: Except for Grog.

3841
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:25.461  
ASHLEY: Don't we need our stuff to heal?

3842
02:28:25.461 --> 02:28:27.114  
LAURA: No, we just need the tuning fork

3843
02:28:27.114 --> 02:28:28.401  
in order to transport.

3844
02:28:28.401 --> 02:28:29.462  
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, most of your spells are fine.

3845
02:28:29.462 --> 02:28:31.599  
Most of your spells are just fine.

3846
02:28:31.599 --> 02:28:34.455  
MATT: Pike, you take 66 points of piercing damage

3847
02:28:34.455 --> 02:28:35.605  
ASHLEY: That's halved?

3848
02:28:35.605 --> 02:28:36.929  
MATT: Halved to 33.

3849
02:28:36.929 --> 02:28:39.779  
SAM: Ooh, 66.

3850
02:28:39.779 --> 02:28:42.200  
MATT: Make a strength saving throw for me, please.

3851
02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.083  
MARISHA: 66? Keyleth takes full damage?

3852
02:28:45.083 --> 02:28:46.442  
MATT: No, no, no, I'm rolling for your--

3853
02:28:46.442 --> 02:28:47.275  
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

3854
02:28:47.275 --> 02:28:50.034  
MATT: Natural 20, you are not grappled.

3855
02:28:50.034 --> 02:28:51.914  
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can use any of your spells

3856
02:28:51.914 --> 02:28:53.584  
that don't cost gold, basically.

3857
02:28:53.584 --> 02:28:54.600  
Any object,

3858
02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:57.288  
if it needs something that has a money cost,

3859
02:28:57.288 --> 02:28:59.038  
but that's not a ton.

3860
02:29:01.441 --> 02:29:03.521  
MATT: Keyleth takes 68 points of piercing damage.

3861
02:29:03.521 --> 02:29:06.727  
And I need you to make a strength saving throw.

3862
02:29:06.727 --> 02:29:07.810  
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3863
02:29:10.101 --> 02:29:10.934  
68.

3864
02:29:13.698 --> 02:29:15.375  
Strength saving throw?

3865
02:29:15.375 --> 02:29:16.958  
MATT: Yes.

3866
02:29:16.958 --> 02:29:18.916  
MARISHA: Okay, 19.

3867
02:29:19.872 --> 02:29:21.012  
MATT: 19, fail.

3868
02:29:21.012 --> 02:29:22.402  
MARISHA: Fuck! What!?

3869
02:29:22.402 --> 02:29:23.622  
MATT: You are grappled and restrained.

3870
02:29:23.622 --> 02:29:24.601  
You're actually caught up.

3871
02:29:24.601 --> 02:29:26.683  
Its hand has engulfed you

3872
02:29:26.683 --> 02:29:28.436  
and you are currently held aloft

3873
02:29:28.436 --> 02:29:32.702  
in this whirlwind of constant stinging sand and dust

3874
02:29:32.702 --> 02:29:33.926  
and shards of glass

3875
02:29:33.926 --> 02:29:36.418  
and whatever air and bits of material it's pulled up

3876
02:29:36.418 --> 02:29:37.827  
into its whirlwind-like fists.

3877
02:29:37.827 --> 02:29:41.233  
You can try and break free as an action on your turn.

3878
02:29:41.233 --> 02:29:43.498  
It's another strength check to try and break free.

3879
02:29:43.498 --> 02:29:44.978  
However, that is the end of its turn.

3880
02:29:44.978 --> 02:29:46.970  
That brings us to--

3881
02:29:47.828 --> 02:29:49.460  
Lieve'tel and Scanlan.

3882
02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:53.815  
SAM: Wow, not a good opening round.

3883
02:29:53.815 --> 02:29:55.185  
LAURA: What the fuck.
LIAM: Keyleth just got

3884
02:29:55.185 --> 02:29:57.143  
wasted, right?

3885
02:29:57.143 --> 02:29:58.851  
MATT: You can barely see her right now.

3886
02:29:58.851 --> 02:29:59.982  
You see the shape of her

3887
02:29:59.982 --> 02:30:04.826  
in this constantly spiraling cluster

3888
02:30:04.826 --> 02:30:08.348  
of wind and matter and shrapnel.

3889
02:30:08.348 --> 02:30:12.221  
LIAM: I'm going to use my movement to go that way.

3890
02:30:12.221 --> 02:30:13.156  
MATT: How many--?

3891
02:30:13.156 --> 02:30:14.662  
LIAM: I'll go almost all of it

3892
02:30:14.662 --> 02:30:16.091  
to the edge of the rock.

3893
02:30:16.091 --> 02:30:18.942  
I'm going to plant the heft

3894
02:30:18.942 --> 02:30:21.699  
of the rod into the ground,

3895
02:30:21.699 --> 02:30:25.442  
which illuminates and lights up the entire area brightly.

3896
02:30:25.442 --> 02:30:27.208  
MATT: The entire area is now brightly lit.

3897
02:30:27.208 --> 02:30:28.041  
Also sorry, Grog,

3898
02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:30.572  
you also take an additional 16 points of piercing damage

3899
02:30:30.572 --> 02:30:32.102  
from attacking it with the melee attack.

3900
02:30:32.102 --> 02:30:34.169  
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
SAM: You get hurt

3901
02:30:34.169 --> 02:30:35.002  
from attacking it?

3902
02:30:35.002 --> 02:30:36.335  
MATT: Yeah.

3903
02:30:36.335 --> 02:30:38.798  
LIAM: Everyone within a 60 foot radius

3904
02:30:38.798 --> 02:30:42.071  
gets plus one bonus to AC and to saving throws

3905
02:30:42.071 --> 02:30:44.172  
and if there's anything invisible, you'd see it.

3906
02:30:44.172 --> 02:30:45.005  
LAURA: Wait, say that again,

3907
02:30:45.005 --> 02:30:45.838  
say that again.

3908
02:30:45.838 --> 02:30:48.668  
LIAM: Everyone within 60 feet of Lieve'tel,

3909
02:30:48.668 --> 02:30:51.550  
gets plus one to AC--

3910
02:30:52.654 --> 02:30:55.054
plus one to AC, plus one to saving throws

3911
02:30:55.054 --> 02:30:59.094  
and as a bonus, I'm going to do--

3912
02:30:59.094 --> 02:31:00.301  
LAURA: Is this concentration?

3913
02:31:00.301 --> 02:31:01.134  
LIAM: Hmm?

3914
02:31:01.134 --> 02:31:01.967  
LAURA: Is this concentration?

3915
02:31:01.967 --> 02:31:04.134  
LIAM: No, it's a magical item.

3916
02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:08.217  
Then Mass Healing Word, level five.

3917
02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:10.790  
TALIESIN: You don't have to roll for it.

3918
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:12.542  
LIAM: No, I know.

3919
02:31:12.542 --> 02:31:14.158  
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I get max.

3920
02:31:14.158 --> 02:31:15.749  
LIAM: Yes, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3921
02:31:15.749 --> 02:31:17.129
TRAVIS: Who gets max, you do?

3922
02:31:17.129 --> 02:31:18.181  
TALIESIN: Anybody.

3923
02:31:18.181 --> 02:31:19.570  
MARISHA: Anyone with Beacon of Hope.

3924
02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.720  
TALIESIN: Which you do not have.

3925
02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:21.653  
TRAVIS: No, it hit me.

3926
02:31:21.653 --> 02:31:23.372  
TALIESIN: Oh, Beacon did hit you, never mind.

3927
02:31:23.372 --> 02:31:25.803  
LIAM: So I'm going to do it at level five.

3928
02:31:25.803 --> 02:31:30.262  
It'll be 12 plus four,

3929
02:31:30.262 --> 02:31:33.193  
16 total to up to six people.

3930
02:31:33.193 --> 02:31:35.526  
So Keyleth, Bertrand, Pike--

3931
02:31:37.528 --> 02:31:39.410  
MATT: The only ones who've taken damage so far, I believe,

3932
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:40.508  
are Keyleth--

3933
02:31:40.508 --> 02:31:44.552  
are Scanlan, Keyleth, Pike, and Grog.

3934
02:31:44.552 --> 02:31:47.344  
LIAM: Okay, so anyone that I see that is hurt.

3935
02:31:47.344 --> 02:31:48.927  
MATT: You heal 16 points.

3936
02:31:48.927 --> 02:31:50.593  
LIAM: 16 total.
SAM: Does that go back up

3937
02:31:50.593 --> 02:31:52.058  
to the temporary hit points also or no?

3938
02:31:52.058 --> 02:31:52.984  
MATT: You don't have temporary hit points.

3939
02:31:52.984 --> 02:31:54.405  
Your maximum hit points are increased.

3940
02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:55.238  
SAM: Oh, cool.

3941
02:31:55.238 --> 02:31:57.655  
MATT: That's how the spell works with Heroes' Feast.

3942
02:31:58.720 --> 02:31:59.987  
Does that finish your turn?

3943
02:31:59.987 --> 02:32:01.713  
LIAM: Yeah, that was action and bonus action.

3944
02:32:01.713 --> 02:32:02.771  
MATT: All right, end of your turn,

3945
02:32:02.771 --> 02:32:03.745  
it's going to use a legendary action

3946
02:32:03.745 --> 02:32:07.362  
to make a slam attack.

3947
02:32:07.362 --> 02:32:10.612  
This one is going to be against Keyleth again.

3948
02:32:12.489 --> 02:32:15.203  
It's going to attempt to just crush you from the inside.

3949
02:32:15.203 --> 02:32:18.246  
MARISHA: I should've gone to an elemental form or something.

3950
02:32:18.246 --> 02:32:20.412  
MATT: That's going to be...

3951
02:32:21.471 --> 02:32:22.604
35 to hit.

3952
02:32:22.604 --> 02:32:23.814  
SAM: Damn.

3953
02:32:23.814 --> 02:32:25.119  
MATT: It's rolling really high.

3954
02:32:25.119 --> 02:32:26.960  
ASHLEY: It's hitting you again?

3955
02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:27.793  
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

3956
02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:31.143  
It's trying to crush me.

3957
02:32:31.143 --> 02:32:33.503  
Trying to squeezy squeeze.

3958
02:32:33.503 --> 02:32:34.967  
TRAVIS: That's a lot of dice.

3959
02:32:34.967 --> 02:32:36.884  
MATT: With a lot of eights?

3960
02:32:40.241 --> 02:32:41.074  
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

3961
02:32:41.074 --> 02:32:42.299  
LAURA: Fuck.

3962
02:32:42.299 --> 02:32:45.762  
MARISHA: You said we got home safe and sound--

3963
02:32:45.762 --> 02:32:47.423  
MATT: 72 points of piercing damage.

3964
02:32:47.423 --> 02:32:50.797  
TRAVIS: (high-pitched yelling)

3965
02:32:50.797 --> 02:32:54.688  
72.
MARISHA: I have one hit point left.

3966
02:32:54.688 --> 02:32:55.813
MATT: Oh, shit!

3967
02:32:55.813 --> 02:32:57.359  
SAM: I thought you just healed a second ago.

3968
02:32:57.359 --> 02:32:58.901  
MARISHA: I did.
LIAM: A little bit.

3969
02:32:58.901 --> 02:33:00.983
SAM: I thought it
was fully healing.

3970
02:33:00.983 --> 02:33:01.816  
LAURA: No.

3971
02:33:01.816 --> 02:33:04.007
LIAM: Full of what the most of the spell does.

3972
02:33:04.007 --> 02:33:05.363  
MATT: Yeah, it was 16.

3973
02:33:07.514 --> 02:33:09.564  
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3974
02:33:09.564 --> 02:33:11.964  
MATT: All right, that ends its legendary action.

3975
02:33:11.964 --> 02:33:13.982  
LAURA: That was just its legendary action.

3976
02:33:13.982 --> 02:33:15.578  
MATT: That was Lieve'tel.

3977
02:33:15.578 --> 02:33:17.390  
Scanlan, what are you doing?

3978
02:33:17.390 --> 02:33:20.514  
SAM: I mean, Jesus.

3979
02:33:20.514 --> 02:33:22.563
MARISHA: (nervous laughter)

3980
02:33:22.563 --> 02:33:23.396  
Holy shit.

3981
02:33:24.565 --> 02:33:27.990  
I will start by inspiring Vex.

3982
02:33:29.059 --> 02:33:33.565  
Yeah, you're the only one who can do anything up there.

3983
02:33:33.565 --> 02:33:36.648  
I will inspire Vex by singing to her.

3984
02:33:37.998 --> 02:33:40.587

SAM: Yeah.

3996
02:34:14.358 --> 02:34:19.358  
I'm going to move away from the thing, that a-way,

3997
02:34:19.363 --> 02:34:20.479  
only 25 feet.

3998
02:34:20.479 --> 02:34:21.694  
MATT: Okay, it does have a ten-foot range.

3999
02:34:21.694 --> 02:34:22.902  
You move out of its melee range.

4000
02:34:22.902 --> 02:34:24.742  
It's going to take an attack of opportunity on you.

4001
02:34:24.742 --> 02:34:25.942  
SAM: Oh shit.

4002
02:34:26.975 --> 02:34:27.946  
MATT: Natural one.

4003
02:34:27.946 --> 02:34:29.399  
ALL: Yay!

4004
02:34:29.399 --> 02:34:31.117  
MATT: You lucky son of a bitch.

4005
02:34:31.117 --> 02:34:32.838  
You are a lucky son of a bitch.

4006
02:34:32.838 --> 02:34:35.063  
All right, so how far you want to move?

4007
02:34:35.063 --> 02:34:37.621
SAM: Just 25 feet away.

4008
02:34:37.621 --> 02:34:39.017  
You can move that far.

4009
02:34:39.017 --> 02:34:41.175  
SAM: Yeah, it's still within 30 feet of it,

4010
02:34:41.175 --> 02:34:42.559
I think, if possible.

4011
02:34:42.559 --> 02:34:44.683  
MATT: Yes, you would be.

4012
02:34:44.683 --> 02:34:46.044  
SAM: Okay.

4013
02:34:46.044 --> 02:34:50.719  
Then my menu of options is very limited.

4014
02:34:51.846 --> 02:34:53.976  
I could try to hurt it.

4015
02:34:53.976 --> 02:34:55.133  
Should I try to hurt it?

4016
02:34:55.133 --> 02:34:56.901  
Or should I try to protect Keyleth?

4017
02:34:56.901 --> 02:34:57.811  
MATT: Somewhere in this field

4018
02:34:57.811 --> 02:34:59.861  
resides your material components,

4019
02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:01.168  
just so you guys know.

4020
02:35:01.168 --> 02:35:02.699  
MARISHA: Yeah, we got to get the fuck out of here.

4021
02:35:02.699 --> 02:35:04.281  
No one stray too far.

4022
02:35:04.281 --> 02:35:05.114  
SAM: Shit.

4023
02:35:07.172 --> 02:35:08.005  
Shit.

4024
02:35:09.005 --> 02:35:12.996  
I'll just cast-- I'll cast ♪ Bigby's Hand ♪.

4025
02:35:12.996 --> 02:35:14.378  
MATT: All right, where do you want it?

4026
02:35:14.378 --> 02:35:16.215  
TRAVIS: Nothing like looking for a tuning fork

4027
02:35:16.215 --> 02:35:18.257  
when there's a Kodiak bear in your cabin.

4028
02:35:18.257 --> 02:35:19.323
SAM: Just near it.

4029
02:35:19.323 --> 02:35:22.754  
I think casting is the action.

4030
02:35:22.754 --> 02:35:23.785  
MATT: I'm pretty sure he can do something

4031
02:35:23.785 --> 02:35:24.777  
on the turn it arrives, right?

4032
02:35:24.777 --> 02:35:26.563  
SAM: It says when you cast this spell

4033
02:35:26.563 --> 02:35:28.431  
and as a bonus action on subsequent turns--

4034
02:35:28.431 --> 02:35:30.018  
oh, so I can do it on this turn?

4035
02:35:30.018 --> 02:35:30.851  
MATT: Yes.

4036
02:35:30.851 --> 02:35:33.126  
SAM: Oh, well, then I'll punch it.

4037
02:35:33.126 --> 02:35:35.223  
MATT: All right, roll for attack.

4038
02:35:35.223 --> 02:35:37.199  
SAM: I'm going to cast it at level six also.

4039
02:35:37.199 --> 02:35:38.407  
MATT: Gotcha.

4040
02:35:38.407 --> 02:35:40.441  
6th-level ♪ Bigby's Hand ♪.

4041
02:35:40.441 --> 02:35:41.526  
SAM: 15 plus--

4042
02:35:41.526 --> 02:35:44.651  
oh, I wish I went and wrote things down.

4043
02:35:44.651 --> 02:35:46.600  
MATT: Your spell attack modifier. It's plus 12.

4044
02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:47.809  
SAM: Plus 12, yes.

4045
02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:48.768  
MATT: That hits.

4046
02:35:48.768 --> 02:35:49.601  
SAM: Okay, great.

4047
02:35:49.601 --> 02:35:54.034  
At level six, it says, um, 2d8--(mumbling)

4048
02:35:54.034 --> 02:35:56.900  
(whining)

4049
02:35:56.900 --> 02:35:58.671  
...4d8 so it's 6d8.

4050
02:35:58.671 --> 02:36:01.365  
MATT: 6d8 bludgeoning damage?

4051
02:36:01.365 --> 02:36:02.198  
TALIESIN: Magical?

4052
02:36:04.082 --> 02:36:05.960  
SAM: Yeah, it'll say that somewhere in here.

4053
02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.167  
Force damage.

4054
02:36:07.167 --> 02:36:09.765  
MATT: Force damage, go for it.

4055
02:36:09.765 --> 02:36:10.674  
Roll for damage.

4056
02:36:10.674 --> 02:36:11.881  
TALIESIN: Yeah, take what you need.

4057
02:36:11.881 --> 02:36:13.399  
SAM: I just-- I need more of these,

4058
02:36:13.399 --> 02:36:14.408  
but I'll just take these.

4059
02:36:14.408 --> 02:36:15.914  
TALIESIN: I know, I didn't pack heavy.

4060
02:36:15.914 --> 02:36:17.062  
I should've packed heavy.

4061
02:36:17.062 --> 02:36:18.228  
SAM: 14.

4062
02:36:18.228 --> 02:36:22.145  
Oh wow, these are really good rolls. 26, right?

4063
02:36:23.649 --> 02:36:25.682  
Yeah, nope, yep.

4064
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:28.244
36.

4065
02:36:28.244 --> 02:36:29.549  
Shit.

4066
02:36:29.549 --> 02:36:31.875  
MATT: 8d8 or 6d8, you said?

4067
02:36:31.875 --> 02:36:33.458  
SAM: 36.

4068
02:36:33.458 --> 02:36:36.649  
MATT: So 36 plus--? do you add anything to it?

4069
02:36:36.649 --> 02:36:37.787
Plus your spell modifier?

4070
02:36:37.787 --> 02:36:39.242  
SAM: I don't think so.

4071
02:36:39.242 --> 02:36:42.674  
It says just 4d8 force damage

4072
02:36:42.674 --> 02:36:45.581  
and then it becomes 6d8.
MATT: How much is that?

4073
02:36:45.581 --> 02:36:46.445  
SAM: 36.

4074
02:36:46.445 --> 02:36:48.163  
MATT: 36 points of force damage.

4075
02:36:48.163 --> 02:36:50.501  
As the fist slams into its form,

4076
02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:55.378  
you watch as sections of its swirling body scatter out,

4077
02:36:55.378 --> 02:36:56.686  
full damage.

4078
02:36:56.686 --> 02:36:58.387  
Doesn't seem to resist the force.

4079
02:36:58.387 --> 02:37:02.471  
It reforms and its green eyes shift within its body

4080
02:37:02.471 --> 02:37:05.213  
and then burn in your direction.

4081
02:37:05.213 --> 02:37:06.046  
But yeah.

4082
02:37:06.046 --> 02:37:08.629  
SAM: Force damage everyone, force.

4083
02:37:09.645 --> 02:37:11.728  
Use the damage.

4084
02:37:13.209 --> 02:37:14.831  
MATT: It did not resist your force damage.

4085
02:37:14.831 --> 02:37:15.929  
Does that finish your turn?

4086
02:37:15.929 --> 02:37:16.822  
SAM: Yes, that's it.

4087
02:37:16.822 --> 02:37:17.655  
MATT: All right.

4088
02:37:17.655 --> 02:37:21.484  
That brings us to Bertrand Bell.

4089
02:37:21.484 --> 02:37:22.609  
TRAVIS: What?

4090
02:37:23.723 --> 02:37:25.139  
SAM: He's got force.

4091
02:37:25.139 --> 02:37:27.089  
Do some force.
MATT: You're in melee with it.

4092
02:37:27.089 --> 02:37:28.447  
You were right up against it.

4093
02:37:28.447 --> 02:37:29.735  
Keyleth is engulfed,

4094
02:37:29.735 --> 02:37:32.049  
giant fist slams into you and you're just like,

4095
02:37:32.049 --> 02:37:33.240  
what is going on?

4096
02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:34.364  
TRAVIS: I'm in melee with it?

4097
02:37:34.364 --> 02:37:35.197  
MATT: Yes.

4098
02:37:35.197 --> 02:37:36.280  
TRAVIS: I will break out of melee

4099
02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:37.976  
and run over and help

4100
02:37:37.976 --> 02:37:40.911  
the dude look for stuff in his cabinets.

4101
02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:41.870  
MATT: Okay.

4102
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:43.110  
TRAVIS: All of 15 feet.

4103
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:44.268  
MATT: He does not get an attack of opportunity.

4104
02:37:44.268 --> 02:37:45.594  
It's already used its reaction.

4105
02:37:45.594 --> 02:37:47.503  
You rush up and you use your action to--

4106
02:37:47.503 --> 02:37:48.336  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) Quickly!

4107
02:37:48.336 --> 02:37:50.644
Find whatever it is they need.

4108
02:37:50.644 --> 02:37:53.082  
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4109
02:37:56.436 --> 02:37:57.269  
TRAVIS: Nine.

4110
02:37:57.269 --> 02:37:58.629  
MATT: Disadvantage because of your exhaustion.

4111
02:37:58.629 --> 02:37:59.690  
TRAVIS: Worse.

4112
02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:01.332  
Oh yeah, that's even worse, six.

4113
02:38:01.332 --> 02:38:03.399  
MATT: Okay, you don't even know where to look.

4114
02:38:03.399 --> 02:38:05.357  
TRAVIS: I'm just yelling at him.

4115
02:38:05.357 --> 02:38:06.315  
MATT: That's okay.

4116
02:38:06.315 --> 02:38:08.319  
That finishes your turn, Bertrand.

4117
02:38:08.319 --> 02:38:12.052  
All right, it is now this adamantine golem's turn.

4118
02:38:12.052 --> 02:38:13.288  
SAM: Yes.

4119
02:38:13.288 --> 02:38:14.121  
TALIESIN: Thank god.

4120
02:38:14.121 --> 02:38:14.954  
LAURA: Oh good.

4121
02:38:14.954 --> 02:38:16.162  
SAM: Hope it doesn't attack us.

4122
02:38:16.162 --> 02:38:18.216  
TALIESIN: Everything's on the odd--

4123
02:38:18.216 --> 02:38:21.099  
MATT: Ten-foot reach with a sword.

4124
02:38:21.099 --> 02:38:22.424  
It can get that far,

4125
02:38:22.424 --> 02:38:23.935  
but with Trinket there it couldn't get any further.

4126
02:38:23.935 --> 02:38:26.250  
It can swing with its sword twice.

4127
02:38:26.250 --> 02:38:29.667  
First attack is going to be-- yeah, that hits.

4128
02:38:30.578 --> 02:38:33.170  
Second attack, both hit.

4129
02:38:36.549 --> 02:38:37.757  
Set up there.

4130
02:38:37.757 --> 02:38:39.937  
TALIESIN: This could've been worse.

4131
02:38:39.937 --> 02:38:41.163  
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

4132
02:38:41.163 --> 02:38:43.576  
Why are you even saying that shit?

4133
02:38:43.576 --> 02:38:45.015  
Have you not been paying attention

4134
02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:46.404  
to this last round?

4135
02:38:46.404 --> 02:38:47.237  
TALIESIN: Nope.

4136
02:38:47.237 --> 02:38:50.735  
MATT: 23 reduced to 13 points damage for the first strike.

4137
02:38:50.735 --> 02:38:51.568  
It's striking,

4138
02:38:51.568 --> 02:38:53.678  
but its blade is carving through

4139
02:38:53.678 --> 02:38:55.925  
and not as effective as you would hope it would be

4140
02:38:55.925 --> 02:38:57.008  
for its size.

4141
02:38:58.975 --> 02:39:02.283  
It just seems to be resistant to slashing damage.

4142
02:39:03.684 --> 02:39:05.863  
But it does take some damage from it.

4143
02:39:05.863 --> 02:39:07.267  
That ends its turn.

4144
02:39:07.267 --> 02:39:08.856  
That brings us to the top of the round.

4145
02:39:08.856 --> 02:39:09.982  
Percival, you're up.

4146
02:39:09.982 --> 02:39:13.318  
TALIESIN: Well, first thing I'm going to do

4147
02:39:13.318 --> 02:39:15.912  
is I'm going to crawl to--

4148
02:39:15.912 --> 02:39:18.048  
I'm going to, using my boots,

4149
02:39:18.048 --> 02:39:21.072  
get to the top of the wall.

4150
02:39:21.072 --> 02:39:23.072  
MATT: -- 15, to top of the wall, or top of the spire?

4151
02:39:23.072 --> 02:39:24.348  
TALIESIN: Actually, just to the spire

4152
02:39:24.348 --> 02:39:25.423  
because I want to see over the corner

4153
02:39:25.423 --> 02:39:26.829  
and see if there's anything back there.

4154
02:39:26.829 --> 02:39:27.662  
MATT: Back here?

4155
02:39:27.662 --> 02:39:28.620  
TALIESIN: I mean, like--

4156
02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:29.854  
MATT: Oh, behind this space?

4157
02:39:29.854 --> 02:39:31.261  
TALIESIN: Yeah, is there things behind there?

4158
02:39:31.261 --> 02:39:32.749  
MATT: You don't see anything at first glance

4159
02:39:32.749 --> 02:39:35.025  
that appears to be containment. You do see at the top here

4160
02:39:35.025 --> 02:39:37.492  
there appears to be a vase and a chest

4161
02:39:37.492 --> 02:39:39.146  
and, looking across the way,

4162
02:39:39.146 --> 02:39:40.580  
there appears to be a wardrobe

4163
02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:42.812  
and another chest here.

4164
02:39:42.812 --> 02:39:45.094  
Across the way here from this perspective,

4165
02:39:45.094 --> 02:39:47.179  
you can also see this chest of stuff on that side as well.

4166
02:39:47.179 --> 02:39:48.137  
TALIESIN: Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

4167
02:39:48.137 --> 02:39:49.474  
All right--

4168
02:39:49.474 --> 02:39:51.694  
MATT: It's 20 feet to get up there.

4169
02:39:51.694 --> 02:39:53.102  
TALIESIN: While I'm up there,

4170
02:39:53.102 --> 02:39:54.522  
you can put me down just somewhere up there.

4171
02:39:54.522 --> 02:39:56.190  
I'm going to take a shot at this thing

4172
02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:58.272  
just to experiment.

4173
02:39:58.272 --> 02:39:59.583  
MATT: Sure.

4174
02:39:59.583 --> 02:40:02.816  
TALIESIN: I'm going to take

4175
02:40:05.195 --> 02:40:06.445  
an Animus shot.

4176
02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.972  
Let's see if this works.

4177
02:40:08.972 --> 02:40:11.039  
I'm also burning a--

4178
02:40:11.039 --> 02:40:12.146  
MATT: And Vex, you're up at the same time, too.

4179
02:40:12.146 --> 02:40:14.646  
TALIESIN: I'm burning a point of grit.

4180
02:40:16.498 --> 02:40:18.417  
This thing has eyes, I assume?

4181
02:40:18.417 --> 02:40:19.719  
MATT: It appears to have eyes,

4182
02:40:19.719 --> 02:40:21.403  
but the eyes themselves seem to be,

4183
02:40:21.403 --> 02:40:22.827  
at least in this particular form,

4184
02:40:22.827 --> 02:40:24.569  
shifting throughout its body.

4185
02:40:24.569 --> 02:40:28.515  
It doesn't seem to be particularly a source of its sight

4186
02:40:28.515 --> 02:40:30.098  
that is consistent.

4187
02:40:31.378 --> 02:40:33.293  
TALIESIN: But if I take a head shot it may--?

4188
02:40:33.293 --> 02:40:34.751  
MATT: It may.

4189
02:40:34.751 --> 02:40:35.657  
TALIESIN: I'll take a head shot.

4190
02:40:35.657 --> 02:40:37.426  
I'll burn a point of grit and take a head shot.

4191
02:40:37.426 --> 02:40:38.676  
MATT: Sure, go for it.

4192
02:40:38.676 --> 02:40:41.001  
TALIESIN: All right, and I get advantage because you're...

4193
02:40:41.001 --> 02:40:41.838
evil.

4194
02:40:41.838 --> 02:40:43.180  
SAM: -- kind man.

4195
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:46.272  
TALIESIN: You're so evil.

4196
02:40:46.272 --> 02:40:47.149  
That's 28 to hit.

4197
02:40:47.149 --> 02:40:48.149  
MATT: That hits.

4198
02:40:49.482 --> 02:40:51.649  
TALIESIN: Then I'm also just--

4199
02:40:54.201 --> 02:40:57.284  
MATT: It is Hexed, so you do an additional d6 damage.

4200
02:40:58.937 --> 02:40:59.878  
TALIESIN: That's right.

4201
02:40:59.878 --> 02:41:01.111  
So I'm going to do--

4202
02:41:01.111 --> 02:41:03.391  
so here's the damage that I do,

4203
02:41:03.391 --> 02:41:07.764  
is six points of piercing.

4204
02:41:07.764 --> 02:41:10.477  
No, I'm sorry. 12 points of piercing damage.

4205
02:41:10.477 --> 02:41:11.717  
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage, all right.

4206
02:41:11.717 --> 02:41:13.055  
Doesn't do quite as much as you hoped.

4207
02:41:13.055 --> 02:41:15.749  
TALIESIN: But that's also four points of psychic

4208
02:41:15.749 --> 02:41:20.026  
and four points of Hex, whatever Hex does.

4209
02:41:20.026 --> 02:41:22.065  
MATT: Necrotic. Go ahead and roll that damage.

4210
02:41:22.065 --> 02:41:23.357  
Oh, four points each?

4211
02:41:23.357 --> 02:41:25.109  
Oh, that's an additional eight points damage.

4212
02:41:25.109 --> 02:41:26.763  
He does not seem to resist the damage from those effects.

4213
02:41:26.763 --> 02:41:27.971  
They do strike through.

4214
02:41:27.971 --> 02:41:29.854  
TALIESIN: Then I did make a head shot.

4215
02:41:29.854 --> 02:41:32.904  
Did it seem like that disrupted the eyes at all?

4216
02:41:32.904 --> 02:41:34.122  
MATT: It was at a disadvantage?

4217
02:41:34.122 --> 02:41:37.972  
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a blinding effect.

4218
02:41:37.972 --> 02:41:40.331  
I didn't print this properly.

4219
02:41:40.331 --> 02:41:45.087  
So it's a-- if I recall, goddamn it.

4220
02:41:45.087 --> 02:41:46.453  
MATT: Know your abilities for this.

4221
02:41:46.453 --> 02:41:48.169  
TALIESIN: It's been awhile.

4222
02:41:48.169 --> 02:41:50.043  
MATT, MARISHA, SAM: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4223
02:41:50.043 --> 02:41:51.485
(laughter)

4224
02:41:51.485 --> 02:41:53.708  
MATT: This is going to be how it always works now.

4225
02:41:53.708 --> 02:41:56.490  
TALIESIN: I believe it gives it one round of disadvantage

4226
02:41:56.490 --> 02:41:57.407  
to attacks.

4227
02:41:58.772 --> 02:41:59.605  
Yes.

4228
02:42:02.163 --> 02:42:04.953  
MATT: It's bad, guys. This is really bad.

4229
02:42:04.953 --> 02:42:08.013  
TALIESIN: I know. I'm also, yeah.

4230
02:42:08.013 --> 02:42:10.176  
I believe it's one round of disadvantage.

4231
02:42:10.176 --> 02:42:13.354  
SAM: Does Matt wear that robe all the time around the house?

4232
02:42:13.354 --> 02:42:14.693  
Do you wear that robe all the time?

4233
02:42:14.693 --> 02:42:16.268  
MARISHA: This is kind of new. It's like,

4234
02:42:16.268 --> 02:42:17.785
this is my summer robe.

4235
02:42:17.785 --> 02:42:20.603  
It's a little bit more lightweight.

4236
02:42:20.603 --> 02:42:22.236
MATT: This is a dazing shot?

4237
02:42:22.236 --> 02:42:23.730  
TALIESIN: Yeah, head shot.

4238
02:42:25.303 --> 02:42:27.861  
Here's Gunslinger 1.3.

4239
02:42:29.888 --> 02:42:30.721  
It is--

4240
02:42:30.721 --> 02:42:31.554  
MATT: It makes a constitution saving throw, suffers

4241
02:42:31.554 --> 02:42:33.276  
disadvantage on attacks until the end of its next turn.

4242
02:42:33.276 --> 02:42:34.109  
Correct.

4243
02:42:34.109 --> 02:42:37.707  
Constitution saving throw against your DC.

4244
02:42:37.707 --> 02:42:38.540  
It's 28.

4245
02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:40.958  
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's fine?
MATT: It's fine.

4246
02:42:40.958 --> 02:42:43.458  
TALIESIN: All right, I'm just going to

4247
02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:47.273  
use my bonus action to--

4248
02:42:47.273 --> 02:42:48.106  
I have two more shots anyway, so I'm going to

4249
02:42:48.106 --> 02:42:50.081
take those two shots.
MATT: Go for it, take the shots.

4250
02:42:50.081 --> 02:42:52.572  
Gotta hurry this up, guys.

4251
02:42:52.572 --> 02:42:55.313  
TALIESIN: That's a-- that hits.

4252
02:42:58.293 --> 02:43:00.630  
That's 15 points of normal damage

4253
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:04.025  
and do you want me to just add the mystical damage?

4254
02:43:04.025 --> 02:43:06.108  
MATT: Give me the additional.

4255
02:43:07.012 --> 02:43:08.591  
TALIESIN: Four necrotic, three psychic.

4256
02:43:08.591 --> 02:43:10.649  
MATT: Gotcha.

4257
02:43:10.649 --> 02:43:11.728  
Total there, got it.

4258
02:43:11.728 --> 02:43:14.294  
TALIESIN: Then last shot

4259
02:43:15.944 --> 02:43:19.194
is shitty, but that's okay.

4260
02:43:20.659 --> 02:43:22.356  
23 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

4261
02:43:22.356 --> 02:43:23.631  
TALIESIN: I'm going to pump all my Cabal's Ruin

4262
02:43:23.631 --> 02:43:25.404  
through this one, too, because fuck it.

4263
02:43:25.404 --> 02:43:27.183  
MATT: Oh, nice.

4264
02:43:27.183 --> 02:43:28.759  
TALIESIN: I'll give you the basic,

4265
02:43:28.759 --> 02:43:32.433  
that's nine points of normal damage,

4266
02:43:32.433 --> 02:43:33.266  
one point necrotic,

4267
02:43:33.266 --> 02:43:34.764  
two points psychic

4268
02:43:34.764 --> 02:43:36.930  
and then I believe it's electrical damage.

4269
02:43:36.930 --> 02:43:37.769  
MATT: It is.

4270
02:43:37.769 --> 02:43:40.786  
TALIESIN: I have 9d6 that I can pour into this.

4271
02:43:40.786 --> 02:43:41.917  
MARISHA: Yes.

4272
02:43:41.917 --> 02:43:44.250  
Yes!
TALIESIN: That's 16 points.

4273
02:43:44.250 --> 02:43:45.083  
MATT: Okay.

4274
02:43:46.958 --> 02:43:48.058  
TALIESIN: 14.

4275
02:43:48.058 --> 02:43:48.891  
MATT: To 30.

4276
02:43:51.606 --> 02:43:52.439  
TALIESIN: Nine more.

4277
02:43:52.439 --> 02:43:55.445  
MATT: So 39 points lightning damage.

4278
02:43:55.445 --> 02:43:56.781  
Cannot resist.

4279
02:43:56.781 --> 02:43:58.392  
Arcs through its body.

4280
02:43:58.392 --> 02:43:59.225  
You watch--

4281
02:43:59.225 --> 02:44:01.236  
it's like watching wildfire storms

4282
02:44:01.236 --> 02:44:02.523  
in the middle of dark clouds,

4283
02:44:02.523 --> 02:44:04.245  
where you see flashes throughout its body

4284
02:44:04.245 --> 02:44:07.636  
as the energy arcs through its entire body.

4285
02:44:07.636 --> 02:44:09.585  
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to drop down

4286
02:44:09.585 --> 02:44:11.702  
and hide behind that bookcase.

4287
02:44:11.702 --> 02:44:13.088  
MATT: You have ten more feet of movement.

4288
02:44:13.088 --> 02:44:15.650  
TALIESIN: I'm dropping down and to the left.

4289
02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:16.808  
MATT: Okay, so you're about here.

4290
02:44:16.808 --> 02:44:18.133
TALIESIN: No, I mean like as far down--

4291
02:44:18.133 --> 02:44:19.241  
I'm getting behind the wall.

4292
02:44:19.241 --> 02:44:21.142  
MATT: All right, we'll put you there.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4293
02:44:21.142 --> 02:44:21.975  
MATT: That's ten feet down

4294
02:44:21.975 --> 02:44:22.808  
from the peak of that.

4295
02:44:22.808 --> 02:44:24.516  
SAM: Were you flying a second ago?

4296
02:44:24.516 --> 02:44:25.871  
TALIESIN: No, I was on top of that thing.

4297
02:44:25.871 --> 02:44:26.713  
MATT: He was on top of the peak.

4298
02:44:26.713 --> 02:44:28.516  
Then you moved ten feet down below behind that.

4299
02:44:28.516 --> 02:44:29.525  
You got it.

4300
02:44:29.525 --> 02:44:32.108  
SAM: Nice, nice turn.

4301
02:44:32.108 --> 02:44:33.476  
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's everything.

4302
02:44:33.476 --> 02:44:36.142  
LAURA: I'm going to use my action to--

4303
02:44:36.142 --> 02:44:37.357  
can I search the area

4304
02:44:37.357 --> 02:44:38.975  
that the Locate Object is sending me to?

4305
02:44:38.975 --> 02:44:39.885  
MATT: Correct.

4306
02:44:39.885 --> 02:44:42.598  
Go ahead and make an investigation check for me,

4307
02:44:42.598 --> 02:44:44.116  
if you don't mind.

4308
02:44:44.116 --> 02:44:46.074  
SAM: Come on, come on.

4309
02:44:46.074 --> 02:44:49.218  
LAURA: Is it with advantage because I have Locate Object on?

4310
02:44:49.218 --> 02:44:50.501  
MATT: I'll allow it.

4311
02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:53.115  
LIAM: Good, because that was a terrible roll.

4312
02:44:53.115 --> 02:44:54.390  
Better.

4313
02:44:56.823 --> 02:44:59.607  
LAURA: 25, no, am I doing that right?

4314
02:44:59.607 --> 02:45:00.856  
Eight plus three is, 21.

4315
02:45:00.856 --> 02:45:02.410  
MATT: 21.

4316
02:45:02.410 --> 02:45:05.210  
You immediately take the pot and hold it over--

4317
02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:06.419  
LAURA: Oh, and I have inspiration.

4318
02:45:06.419 --> 02:45:07.610  
SAM: If you want it.
MATT: You do.

4319
02:45:07.610 --> 02:45:10.501  
LAURA: Fuck it, I'm using it.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to use it now

4320
02:45:10.501 --> 02:45:11.974  
LAURA: Ooh, plus 12!

4321
02:45:11.974 --> 02:45:13.540  
MARISHA: Whoa!

4322
02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:15.727  
MATT: You reach over and grab the vase

4323
02:45:15.727 --> 02:45:17.860  
and in one quick motion

4324
02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:19.497  
look into it and let it fall and it shatters,

4325
02:45:19.497 --> 02:45:20.330  
nothing inside.

4326
02:45:20.330 --> 02:45:21.778  
You reach over and there's the chest.

4327
02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:22.611  
You throw it open

4328
02:45:22.611 --> 02:45:25.660  
and there is just a pile of random knickknacks

4329
02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:27.036  
and pieces of tattered cloth.

4330
02:45:27.036 --> 02:45:28.276  
Just focusing in,

4331
02:45:28.276 --> 02:45:30.607  
you pour through, reach down inside

4332
02:45:30.607 --> 02:45:34.531  
and pull up the Bag of Holding.

4333
02:45:34.531 --> 02:45:36.328  
LAURA: Yes!

4334
02:45:36.328 --> 02:45:38.492  
MATT: But it's not what you've been looking for.

4335
02:45:38.492 --> 02:45:39.879  
You hold it, you reach past,

4336
02:45:39.879 --> 02:45:41.767  
and reach down and your fingers touch

4337
02:45:41.767 --> 02:45:42.875  
a bunch of pieces of objects.

4338
02:45:42.875 --> 02:45:44.868  
You find one that seems to resonate.

4339
02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:46.691  
You pull it out and there's the tuning fork.

4340
02:45:46.691 --> 02:45:47.524  
MARISHA: Yes!

4341
02:45:47.524 --> 02:45:48.565  
LAURA: Yes!

4342
02:45:49.711 --> 02:45:51.770  
I've got it. I've got it.

4343
02:45:51.770 --> 02:45:54.878  
MATT: You're still prone and you moved ten feet.

4344
02:45:54.878 --> 02:45:56.477  
LAURA: Okay.

4345
02:45:56.477 --> 02:46:00.211  
I'm going to, oh god,

4346
02:46:00.211 --> 02:46:02.647  
okay, for my bonus action,

4347
02:46:02.647 --> 02:46:05.294  
since I did that for my action, right?

4348
02:46:05.294 --> 02:46:09.486  
For my bonus action, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine.

4349
02:46:10.692 --> 02:46:13.125  
I'm going to cast it--

4350
02:46:13.125 --> 02:46:15.330  
is Keyleth in his fist?

4351
02:46:15.330 --> 02:46:17.545  
MATT: Yeah. Like the fist is ten feet wide.

4352
02:46:17.545 --> 02:46:19.033  
Keyleth is just the shadow inside of it

4353
02:46:19.033 --> 02:46:21.232  
rolling around like a gyroscope

4354
02:46:21.232 --> 02:46:23.745
being tossed and buffeted about on the inside.

4355
02:46:23.745 --> 02:46:26.916
MARISHA: Next turn. I'm next. I'm after you.

4356
02:46:26.916 --> 02:46:28.398  
LAURA: Okay, so I shouldn't do this?

4357
02:46:28.398 --> 02:46:29.400  
MARISHA: What do you mean?

4358
02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.780  
I don't know what you're doing.

4359
02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:33.187  
I don't know what you're talking about.

4360
02:46:33.187 --> 02:46:35.186  
LAURA: I'm just going to do it anyway.

4361
02:46:35.186 --> 02:46:37.650  
Grasping Vine at its feet.

4362
02:46:37.650 --> 02:46:39.600  
Then it's going to reach up and grab Keyleth's feet

4363
02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:41.866  
and try to pull her out of the fist.
MARISHA: Yeah!

4364
02:46:41.866 --> 02:46:43.965  
MATT: All right, so under it, so right here.

4365
02:46:43.965 --> 02:46:44.798  
LAURA: Yeah.

4366
02:46:44.798 --> 02:46:45.982  
MATT: Okay, you got it.

4367
02:46:45.982 --> 02:46:47.074  
So Grasping Vine--

4368
02:46:47.074 --> 02:46:48.396  
LAURA: I want her to stay within melee range.

4369
02:46:48.396 --> 02:46:50.761  
I don't want him to get an attack of opportunity on her

4370
02:46:50.761 --> 02:46:51.802  
but I want to--

4371
02:46:51.802 --> 02:46:53.604  
TALIESIN: He's burned one anyway.

4372
02:46:53.604 --> 02:46:54.712  
MATT: Well, the forced movement doesn't make

4373
02:46:54.712 --> 02:46:55.885  
an attack of opportunity.

4374
02:46:55.885 --> 02:46:57.357  
LAURA: Okay.

4375
02:46:57.357 --> 02:46:59.131  
Well, then, fuck it, I'm going to move her farther away

4376
02:46:59.131 --> 02:46:59.964  
if I can.

4377
02:47:02.169 --> 02:47:04.846  
I can pull her up to 20 feet away from him.

4378
02:47:04.846 --> 02:47:05.723  
MATT: 20 feet away.

4379
02:47:05.723 --> 02:47:07.840  
It says must succeed at dexterity saving throw or be pulled,

4380
02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:09.096  
but this is pulling it away from it.

4381
02:47:09.096 --> 02:47:11.175  
I will say it is you,

4382
02:47:11.175 --> 02:47:13.792  
it rolling a strength check

4383
02:47:13.792 --> 02:47:16.090  
versus your spell check.

4384
02:47:16.090 --> 02:47:18.223  
Roll a D20 and add your wisdom modifier

4385
02:47:18.223 --> 02:47:19.913  
and it's going to roll a strength check.

4386
02:47:19.913 --> 02:47:22.400  
TALIESIN: Disadvantage on the strength check

4387
02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:25.733  
MATT: Yes, it is, disadvantage, you're right.

4388
02:47:28.446 --> 02:47:30.222  
SAM: Spell modifier.

4389
02:47:30.222 --> 02:47:32.340  
LIAM: It's on your spell page.
LAURA: Yeah.

4390
02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:35.282  
LIAM: That's it. No, that's attack bonus.

4391
02:47:35.282 --> 02:47:36.525  
LAURA: Yeah, that's my spell.

4392
02:47:36.525 --> 02:47:37.862  
LIAM: Your spell modifier.

4393
02:47:37.862 --> 02:47:39.663  
MATT: Spell modifier is your wisdom modifier.

4394
02:47:39.663 --> 02:47:41.782  
LAURA: Oh, well then yeah, it's only eight.

4395
02:47:41.782 --> 02:47:44.288  
MATT: Eight, yeah, doesn't pull her free, unfortunately.

4396
02:47:44.288 --> 02:47:46.964  
Yeah, even with the disadvantage, it had the 23.

4397
02:47:46.964 --> 02:47:48.547  
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4398
02:47:49.504 --> 02:47:51.600  
MATT: The vine is like up inside trying to pull free

4399
02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:53.608  
and it's taut, but it's not actually managing

4400
02:47:53.608 --> 02:47:54.925  
to pull her from its grasp.

4401
02:47:54.925 --> 02:47:56.909  
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: That end your turn?

4402
02:47:56.909 --> 02:47:58.630  
LAURA: No, I've still got my movement.

4403
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:59.966  
MATT: You have 20 feet of movement.

4404
02:47:59.966 --> 02:48:01.589  
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to stand up.

4405
02:48:01.589 --> 02:48:03.890  
MATT: Okay, you have five feet of movement.

4406
02:48:03.890 --> 02:48:06.549  
LAURA: Okay, well, I'm just going to stay up here

4407
02:48:06.549 --> 02:48:07.822  
because right now.

4408
02:48:07.822 --> 02:48:09.426  
I'm going to back up against the wall

4409
02:48:09.426 --> 02:48:10.259  
so he can't see me,

4410
02:48:10.259 --> 02:48:13.195  
like crouched amongst all the little trinkets.

4411
02:48:13.195 --> 02:48:14.899  
MATT: Into the little elements there, you got it.

4412
02:48:14.899 --> 02:48:19.832  
LAURA: Then Trinket is going to run towards the--

4413
02:48:21.313 --> 02:48:22.446  
TALIESIN: Do we have the ear pieces? We do.

4414
02:48:22.446 --> 02:48:24.941  
We can talk to each other, by the way. It's been awhile.

4415
02:48:24.941 --> 02:48:26.456  
SAM, MARISHA, and LIAM: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4416
02:48:26.456 --> 02:48:28.140  
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

4417
02:48:30.398 --> 02:48:33.344  
MATT: All right, anything else?

4418
02:48:33.344 --> 02:48:35.007  
All right, that finishes your turn.

4419
02:48:35.007 --> 02:48:36.921  
End of your turn, it's going to use--

4420
02:48:36.921 --> 02:48:39.665  
LAURA: I'm going to use my ear piece and go:

4421
02:48:39.665 --> 02:48:40.940  
Found the tuning fork.

4422
02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:42.506
TALIESIN: We've got to bugger out. Let's bugger out.

4423
02:48:42.506 --> 02:48:44.953  
MATT: It's going to use another legendary action

4424
02:48:44.953 --> 02:48:48.552  
to attempt to squeeze out Keyleth.

4425
02:48:51.938 --> 02:48:53.142  
That's going to be,

4426
02:48:53.142 --> 02:48:54.817
SAM: I will Cutting Words that.

4427
02:48:55.819 --> 02:48:57.990  
MATT: So 25 to hit.
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan.

4428
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:59.387  
MATT: So what do you do?

4429
02:48:59.387 --> 02:49:00.713  
MATT: I will yell at it:

4430
02:49:00.713 --> 02:49:03.855  
Your virginity breeds mites

4431
02:49:03.855 --> 02:49:06.088  
much like a cheese!

4432
02:49:07.698 --> 02:49:08.806
That's Shakespeare, folks.

4433
02:49:08.806 --> 02:49:10.277  
MATT: Well, done, well done.

4434
02:49:10.277 --> 02:49:13.047  
As it is the classic bard, from the bard,

4435
02:49:13.047 --> 02:49:14.181  
go ahead and roll your d12

4436
02:49:14.181 --> 02:49:15.482  
and we'll reduce that.
SAM: Is this a 12?

4437
02:49:15.482 --> 02:49:16.930  
MATT: It's a 12, yeah.

4438
02:49:16.930 --> 02:49:18.202  
SAM: 12!

4439
02:49:18.202 --> 02:49:19.818  
MARISHA: Yes!

4440
02:49:20.818 --> 02:49:21.877
Fucking fail!

4441
02:49:21.877 --> 02:49:24.110  
MATT: 13.

4442
02:49:24.110 --> 02:49:28.344  
It tries to squeeze and crush you from the inside.

4443
02:49:28.344 --> 02:49:30.540  
Unfortunately,

4444
02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:33.598  
the grasping vine actually pulls you toward the cusp of it

4445
02:49:33.598 --> 02:49:35.996  
and most of the force just manages to avoid

4446
02:49:35.996 --> 02:49:38.344  
colliding into your body. You watch as a bunch of stones

4447
02:49:38.344 --> 02:49:40.129  
smack and spark on the inside

4448
02:49:40.129 --> 02:49:42.473
where your body would've been.

4449
02:49:42.473 --> 02:49:45.085
LIAM: Continuity: hold!

4450
02:49:45.085 --> 02:49:48.230  
MATT: All right, that brings us to Bob's turn.

4451
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:49.933  
Bob goes ahead and rummages through

4452
02:49:49.933 --> 02:49:53.569  
and pulls out a few books that he's collecting.

4453
02:49:53.569 --> 02:49:58.415  
Manages to pull out another satchel of items

4454
02:49:58.415 --> 02:50:01.606  
that looks familiar to you, Pike.

4455
02:50:01.606 --> 02:50:03.640  
It's your material components.
SAM: (gasps)

4456
02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:05.736  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
SAM: Getting all the stuff back.

4457
02:50:05.736 --> 02:50:09.269  
MATT: Pulls it out and goes, "I think I found something."

4458
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:11.261  
That ends his turn.

4459
02:50:11.261 --> 02:50:12.719  
Keyleth, you're up.

4460
02:50:12.719 --> 02:50:15.794  
MARISHA: Okay, I'm really mad now.

4461
02:50:15.794 --> 02:50:17.608  
So I'm going to use my bonus action

4462
02:50:17.608 --> 02:50:22.608  
to turn into an air elemental version of him.

4463
02:50:23.083 --> 02:50:25.347  
(laughter)

4464
02:50:25.347 --> 02:50:26.976  
LIAM: Super cool.
MATT: It's been awhile since I've--

4465
02:50:26.976 --> 02:50:28.654  
ALL: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4466
02:50:28.654 --> 02:50:30.424  
MATT: Goddamn it.

4467
02:50:30.424 --> 02:50:32.710  
I'll be right back.

4468
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:36.026  
TRAVIS: How can that happen three times in 20 minutes?

4469
02:50:36.026 --> 02:50:37.867  
Oh my god.

4470
02:50:39.435 --> 02:50:41.816  
How high can we go?

4471
02:50:41.816 --> 02:50:45.711  
Let's see where this rocket ship takes us.

4472
02:50:45.711 --> 02:50:48.254  
TALIESIN: We're buggering, right? Are we buggering?

4473
02:50:48.254 --> 02:50:52.655  
MATT: Yeah, so Keyleth turns into an air elemental.

4474
02:50:52.655 --> 02:50:55.506  
LAURA: Oh, look at it.
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

4475
02:50:55.506 --> 02:50:57.672  
SAM: What happens when air and air fight?

4476
02:50:57.672 --> 02:50:59.821  
MARISHA: Well, it means I cannot be grappled or restrained.

4477
02:50:59.821 --> 02:51:01.061  
MATT: Yeah, you are immune to being grappled and restrained.

4478
02:51:01.061 --> 02:51:02.894  
MARISHA: So I slip out of it.

4479
02:51:04.368 --> 02:51:08.584  
I cast, because I can do that now at level 20,

4480
02:51:08.584 --> 02:51:12.270
Sunbeam.

4481
02:51:12.270 --> 02:51:14.799  
MATT: Sunbeam, does that require--

4482
02:51:14.799 --> 02:51:18.049  
MARISHA: Oh, you're right, a magnifying glass.

4483
02:51:19.439 --> 02:51:21.828  
LAURA: I thought it was anything with a monetary value.

4484
02:51:21.828 --> 02:51:25.250  
MATT: No, for her ability to cast in her shape changed form,

4485
02:51:25.250 --> 02:51:26.292  
it has to be verbal and somatic.

4486
02:51:26.292 --> 02:51:27.647  
It cannot have a material component.

4487
02:51:27.647 --> 02:51:29.625  
LAURA: Oh, oh, I understand.

4488
02:51:29.625 --> 02:51:30.989
MARISHA: Fuck.

4489
02:51:30.989 --> 02:51:32.761  
TALIESIN: There's still stuff, right?

4490
02:51:32.761 --> 02:51:35.435  
Do you need list of spells?

4491
02:51:35.435 --> 02:51:39.287  
MARISHA: What did I fucking have instead?

4492
02:51:39.287 --> 02:51:41.182  
Oh shit.

4493
02:51:41.182 --> 02:51:42.792  
LAURA: This is complicated.

4494
02:51:42.792 --> 02:51:45.635  
SAM: Well, you know because it's been--

4495
02:51:45.635 --> 02:51:46.826
LAURA: No.

4496
02:51:46.826 --> 02:51:48.326  
LIAM: It's been a spell.

4497
02:51:49.452 --> 02:51:50.827  
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4498
02:51:50.827 --> 02:51:52.298  
TALIESIN: No, that's what it's here for.

4499
02:51:52.298 --> 02:51:53.631  
MARISHA: I instead

4500
02:51:53.631 --> 02:51:58.157  
go-- just find-- just pull it for me.

4501
02:51:58.157 --> 02:52:01.683  
SAM: Don't yell at the iPad.
TALIESIN: There it is.

4502
02:52:01.683 --> 02:52:03.349  
MARISHA: I'm going to do Blight. I'm trying to do Blight.

4503
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:05.128  
I Blight it in its face.

4504
02:52:05.128 --> 02:52:09.595  
While I'm still inside of it

4505
02:52:09.595 --> 02:52:12.300  
I go air elemental

4506
02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:16.675  
and I just release all these undead

4507
02:52:16.675 --> 02:52:19.924
sporelike things from my form.

4508
02:52:19.924 --> 02:52:21.482  
MATT: They get immediately picked up

4509
02:52:21.482 --> 02:52:22.516  
and wind throughout its body.

4510
02:52:22.516 --> 02:52:24.036  
MARISHA: And do necrotic damage.

4511
02:52:24.036 --> 02:52:25.523  
MATT: 14, I rolled a four.

4512
02:52:25.523 --> 02:52:28.623  
So I believe it does not save. So you do full damage.

4513
02:52:28.623 --> 02:52:29.957  
MARISHA: So I do 8d8.

4514
02:52:29.957 --> 02:52:31.014  
ASHLEY: 8d8?

4515
02:52:31.014 --> 02:52:33.861  
MARISHA: Yeah, I do two at a time here.

4516
02:52:33.861 --> 02:52:35.844  
Yes, 13.

4517
02:52:38.837 --> 02:52:40.793  
Damn, yes, 12.

4518
02:52:40.793 --> 02:52:44.460  
Are you adding 13 plus 12 is 25.

4519
02:52:46.371 --> 02:52:47.454  
14.

4520
02:52:47.454 --> 02:52:48.537  
MATT: Okay, so 39.

4521
02:52:49.781 --> 02:52:51.364  
MARISHA: 39.

4522
02:52:51.364 --> 02:52:52.886  
And nine.

4523
02:52:52.886 --> 02:52:55.227  
MATT: So 48.

4524
02:52:56.148 --> 02:52:59.277  
48 necrotic damage to it, nice.

4525
02:52:59.277 --> 02:53:00.957  
You watch the eyes flicker for a second.

4526
02:53:00.957 --> 02:53:02.410  
The green glows from inside of it

4527
02:53:02.410 --> 02:53:05.077  
spiraling tornado like dust form.

4528
02:53:06.206 --> 02:53:08.659  
Its storm like face glares towards you

4529
02:53:08.659 --> 02:53:10.232  
as you draw--

4530
02:53:10.232 --> 02:53:11.719  
are you moving out of its grasp?

4531
02:53:11.719 --> 02:53:15.470  
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm now going to fly up

4532
02:53:15.470 --> 02:53:17.487  
and I've got 90 feet of movement

4533
02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:22.096  
and I'm going to fly and land down next to Vex.

4534
02:53:22.096 --> 02:53:25.120  
MATT: Oh so you're landing? Okay.

4535
02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:26.567  
There you go.

4536
02:53:26.567 --> 02:53:28.208  
LAURA: Oh, hey.

4537
02:53:29.668 --> 02:53:32.075
MARISHA: Rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!

4538
02:53:32.075 --> 02:53:34.028  
MATT: That ends your turn?
MARISHA: Yes.

4539
02:53:34.028 --> 02:53:36.013  
MATT: Okay, great.

4540
02:53:36.013 --> 02:53:38.721  
At the end of your turn,

4541
02:53:38.721 --> 02:53:42.038  
it's going to go ahead and...

4542
02:53:43.324 --> 02:53:44.432  
Hmmm.

4543
02:53:46.127 --> 02:53:48.772  
Yeah, it's going to use its last legendary action

4544
02:53:48.772 --> 02:53:51.137  
to attempt to slam you, Pike.

4545
02:53:51.137 --> 02:53:52.955  
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: No!

4546
02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:53.957  
ASHLEY: It's okay.

4547
02:53:53.957 --> 02:53:55.886  
TRAVIS: I'll kill you.
MATT: That's a natural 20.

4548
02:53:55.886 --> 02:53:57.186  
LIAM: No, it's not.

4549
02:53:57.186 --> 02:53:59.126  
Grave cleric.

4550
02:53:59.126 --> 02:54:02.043  
(laughter)

4551
02:54:04.730 --> 02:54:07.109  
MATT: Robbed me of my joy.
LIAM: Sentinel at Death's Door!

4552
02:54:07.109 --> 02:54:09.231  
TALIESIN: Isn't it so cool?
LIAM: It's the best.

4553
02:54:09.231 --> 02:54:13.156  
I really swag grave cleric from my short time with her.

4554
02:54:16.845 --> 02:54:19.735  
ASHLEY: Was does that mean? So it's halved?

4555
02:54:19.735 --> 02:54:22.005  
LIAM: It undoes critical hit.

4556
02:54:22.005 --> 02:54:24.452  
LAURA: So it doesn't get like double deck damage on you.

4557
02:54:24.452 --> 02:54:25.526  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

4558
02:54:25.526 --> 02:54:27.557  
TALIESIN: It's very particular.

4559
02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:30.374
It has to be used very--
LIAM: Got to be paying attention.

4560
02:54:30.374 --> 02:54:31.836  
TALIESIN: Yeah, and you got to be right there.

4561
02:54:31.836 --> 02:54:33.577  
ASHLEY: Okay, thank you, Lieve.

4562
02:54:33.577 --> 02:54:38.426  
MATT: You take, it would be 58 points of piercing damage,

4563
02:54:38.426 --> 02:54:40.654  
but halved because you halved that.

4564
02:54:40.654 --> 02:54:45.654  
So that would be 26.

4565
02:54:46.221 --> 02:54:47.650  
No, 24.

4566
02:54:48.526 --> 02:54:50.295  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4567
02:54:50.295 --> 02:54:52.361  
ASHLEY: What'd you say? 68 or 58?

4568
02:54:52.361 --> 02:54:54.523  
MATT: 58 halved.
SAM: So that's 29.

4569
02:54:54.523 --> 02:54:55.484  
MATT: 29, thank you.

4570
02:54:55.484 --> 02:54:56.934  
29, math.

4571
02:54:56.934 --> 02:54:58.559  
29 points piercing damage.

4572
02:54:58.559 --> 02:54:59.537  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

4573
02:54:59.537 --> 02:55:01.835  
MATT: That finishes Keyleth's turn.

4574
02:55:01.835 --> 02:55:02.985  
Grog, you're up.

4575
02:55:02.985 --> 02:55:05.916  
TRAVIS: Yeah. I would like to run and jump

4576
02:55:05.916 --> 02:55:08.825  
and try to dive tackle the big--

4577
02:55:09.722 --> 02:55:11.264  
ASHLEY: Constitution for beacon.

4578
02:55:11.264 --> 02:55:13.144  
MATT: Yes, you do.

4579
02:55:13.144 --> 02:55:14.145  
ASHLEY: It's gone.

4580
02:55:14.145 --> 02:55:15.518  
LAURA: How do you know?

4581
02:55:15.518 --> 02:55:16.947  
ASHLEY: It's an eight.

4582
02:55:16.947 --> 02:55:18.058  
LAURA: Oh.

4583
02:55:18.058 --> 02:55:20.041  
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4584
02:55:20.041 --> 02:55:21.954  
MATT: All right, so Beacon of Hope fades.

4585
02:55:21.954 --> 02:55:24.803  
MARISHA: Plus your wisdom, right?

4586
02:55:24.803 --> 02:55:26.844  
MATT: Constitution modifier.

4587
02:55:26.844 --> 02:55:28.368  
ASHLEY: Constitution, yeah.

4588
02:55:28.368 --> 02:55:30.118
TRAVIS: For my bonus action, I would like to rage.

4589
02:55:30.118 --> 02:55:31.677  
MATT: All right, there you go.

4590
02:55:31.677 --> 02:55:32.862  
In the air,

4591
02:55:32.862 --> 02:55:34.266  
the rage bursts through your blood

4592
02:55:34.266 --> 02:55:36.086  
and you reach in to try and grab something

4593
02:55:36.086 --> 02:55:36.987  
that is made of wind.

4594
02:55:36.987 --> 02:55:38.653  
TRAVIS: Okay. I jump and dive,

4595
02:55:38.653 --> 02:55:39.706  
try to dive tackle him.

4596
02:55:39.706 --> 02:55:41.013  
Do I just pass right through?

4597
02:55:41.013 --> 02:55:41.846  
MATT: You pass into him.

4598
02:55:41.846 --> 02:55:43.526  
TRAVIS: Oh.
SAM: Oh god.

4599
02:55:43.526 --> 02:55:47.123  
MATT: You are currently engulfed inside its body.

4600
02:55:47.123 --> 02:55:50.718  
TRAVIS: Oh, I didn't dive straight through it?

4601
02:55:50.718 --> 02:55:52.843  
MATT: I mean, what are you trying to do?

4602
02:55:52.843 --> 02:55:55.168
TRAVIS: I'm trying to dive tackle

4603
02:55:55.168 --> 02:55:57.942  
and if I can't grab him just go straight through him

4604
02:55:57.942 --> 02:55:59.474  
to the other side.

4605
02:55:59.474 --> 02:56:00.949  
MATT: Okay, are you using your action

4606
02:56:00.949 --> 02:56:01.977  
to attempt to grapple it then?

4607
02:56:01.977 --> 02:56:02.810  
TRAVIS: Yes.

4608
02:56:02.810 --> 02:56:03.843  
MATT: So for one of your attacks,

4609
02:56:03.843 --> 02:56:04.870  
you're attempting to grapple.

4610
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:06.303  
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4611
02:56:06.303 --> 02:56:08.674  
Yeah, it is immune to being grappled in this form.

4612
02:56:08.674 --> 02:56:11.091  
So you don't pass through it,

4613
02:56:11.091 --> 02:56:13.501  
you try and grab it and now you're in its space.

4614
02:56:13.501 --> 02:56:14.682  
So your first attack, no effect.

4615
02:56:14.682 --> 02:56:16.840  
MATT: I'll stay in its space

4616
02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:18.341  
and I'll move around to the other side

4617
02:56:18.341 --> 02:56:20.107  
where the pedestal is.

4618
02:56:20.107 --> 02:56:22.957  
MATT: Yeah, you do take 16 points of piercing damage

4619
02:56:22.957 --> 02:56:24.707  
reduced to eight.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4620
02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:27.288  
MATT: Then you're going to move around--

4621
02:56:27.288 --> 02:56:28.579  
TRAVIS: I'm going to do counter-clockwise,

4622
02:56:28.579 --> 02:56:31.187
yep, to your left,

4623
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:35.506  
50 feet, as far as I can.

4624
02:56:35.506 --> 02:56:37.740  
MATT: About there.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4625
02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:38.777  
TRAVIS: Are any of the party--

4626
02:56:38.777 --> 02:56:39.751  
I can't see over there--

4627
02:56:39.751 --> 02:56:41.421  
are any of the party members that I'm near?

4628
02:56:41.421 --> 02:56:42.527  
SAM: You're right next to Pike.

4629
02:56:42.527 --> 02:56:43.703  
TALIESIN: Then above you--

4630
02:56:43.703 --> 02:56:46.314  
MATT: Above you is Vex and Keyleth.

4631
02:56:46.314 --> 02:56:48.564  
TRAVIS: Great. I'll be like: Did you find the thing?

4632
02:56:48.564 --> 02:56:52.339  
Here are my hands. And that's it, that's my turn.

4633
02:56:52.339 --> 02:56:54.829  
MATT: All right, that finishes Grog's go.

4634
02:56:54.829 --> 02:56:56.969  
That brings us to Pike.

4635
02:56:56.969 --> 02:56:58.827  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

4636
02:56:58.827 --> 02:56:59.986  
I am going to--

4637
02:56:59.986 --> 02:57:02.402  
MATT: Oh and Pike, I do need you to make a--

4638
02:57:02.402 --> 02:57:04.720  
sorry, I need you to make a strength saving throw.

4639
02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:06.578  
ASHLEY: Okay.

4640
02:57:08.484 --> 02:57:09.817  
Ooh, no.

4641
02:57:09.817 --> 02:57:11.299  
That's a six.

4642
02:57:11.299 --> 02:57:12.331  
MATT: You are grappled and restrained

4643
02:57:12.331 --> 02:57:13.904  
from when it didn't hit you last time.

4644
02:57:13.904 --> 02:57:16.599  
So you are currently held in its space.

4645
02:57:16.599 --> 02:57:18.266  
ASHLEY: Well, then I will--

4646
02:57:19.119 --> 02:57:20.458  
MATT: Just like Keyleth was balled up in its fist

4647
02:57:20.458 --> 02:57:21.291  
in its one hand,

4648
02:57:21.291 --> 02:57:23.134  
the other hand grabs and now you're just

4649
02:57:23.134 --> 02:57:25.117  
being buffeted around

4650
02:57:25.117 --> 02:57:26.476  
and just pelted from all angles.

4651
02:57:26.476 --> 02:57:27.309  
You can barely see

4652
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:28.778  
TALIESIN: As long as we're touching.

4653
02:57:28.778 --> 02:57:31.336  
ASHLEY: I am going to

4654
02:57:31.336 --> 02:57:34.527
grasp my holy symbol

4655
02:57:36.016 --> 02:57:39.389  
and I'm going to pray to Sarenrae for Divine Intervention,

4656
02:57:39.389 --> 02:57:42.406  
because it is an automatic success.

4657
02:57:42.406 --> 02:57:43.777  
MATT: At level 20, that's right.

4658
02:57:43.777 --> 02:57:44.610  
(yelling)

4659
02:57:44.610 --> 02:57:45.937
LIAM: Yeah, that's right!

4660
02:57:45.937 --> 02:57:47.614  
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

4661
02:57:47.614 --> 02:57:50.164  
Pike in the house.

4662
02:57:52.670 --> 02:57:53.503
LAURA: Oh no.

4663
02:57:53.503 --> 02:57:55.241
MARISHA: Why is he looking it up?

4664
02:57:55.241 --> 02:57:56.616
TALIESIN: He's got to see exactly

4665
02:57:56.616 --> 02:57:58.641  
MATT: It's been awhile since we've done this--

4666
02:57:58.641 --> 02:58:00.431  
LIAM, LAURA, ASHLEY, SAM, and TALIESIN: ♪ It's been awhile ♪

4667
02:58:00.431 --> 02:58:02.169  
MTT: I hate you all so much.

4668
02:58:02.169 --> 02:58:03.337  
TRAVIS: That's four.

4669
02:58:03.337 --> 02:58:05.126  
MATT: Describe the assistance you seek.

4670
02:58:05.126 --> 02:58:07.715  
ASHLEY: Okay.

4671
02:58:07.715 --> 02:58:12.173  
I am hoping that she will-- say again--

4672
02:58:12.173 --> 02:58:13.006
SAM and MATT: You're praying.

4673
02:58:13.006 --> 02:58:14.997  
ASHLEY: I pray to her, I'm not hoping,

4674
02:58:14.997 --> 02:58:17.146  
she's just going to just come down.

4675
02:58:17.146 --> 02:58:18.579
TRAVIS: Oh Sarenrae!

4676
02:58:18.579 --> 02:58:21.181  
ASHLEY: She will help grapple him

4677
02:58:21.181 --> 02:58:23.031  
and keep him away

4678
02:58:23.031 --> 02:58:26.664  
so we can get together and BAMF out.

4679
02:58:27.829 --> 02:58:29.037  
MATT: Okay.

4680
02:58:29.037 --> 02:58:31.780  
ASHLEY: Just like hold him down

4681
02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:34.196  
with her holy strength.

4682
02:58:34.196 --> 02:58:37.603  
MATT: As you finish your prayer,

4683
02:58:37.603 --> 02:58:42.595  
your eyes close and in the darkness of your eyes

4684
02:58:42.595 --> 02:58:44.632  
shutting out all the light around you

4685
02:58:44.632 --> 02:58:47.404  
and the pain and the sting of the wind and sand

4686
02:58:47.404 --> 02:58:50.115  
pelting you from the winds and the creature around you

4687
02:58:50.115 --> 02:58:53.769  
in the darkness, you see a flickering light

4688
02:58:53.769 --> 02:58:55.435  
and you look forward and you realize that moment

4689
02:58:55.435 --> 02:58:59.324  
this creature physically cannot be restrained

4690
02:58:59.324 --> 02:59:01.490  
or held back.

4691
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:04.433  
You're like, your heart's broken

4692
02:59:04.433 --> 02:59:06.006  
in that moment of realization.

4693
02:59:06.006 --> 02:59:08.633  
Just past the boundary of the wind you watch

4694
02:59:08.633 --> 02:59:10.196  
is over here on this side

4695
02:59:10.196 --> 02:59:13.546  
its flame burns upward,

4696
02:59:13.546 --> 02:59:17.300  
you watch the flame burns into two phoenix wings.

4697
02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:20.997  
As the flames engulf the space,

4698
02:59:20.997 --> 02:59:22.337  
Scanlan, you're like, "Oh god!"

4699
02:59:22.337 --> 02:59:23.795  
The heat is immense.

4700
02:59:23.795 --> 02:59:25.216  
And over your shoulder, you watch

4701
02:59:25.216 --> 02:59:26.786  
as these phoenix wings unfurl

4702
02:59:26.786 --> 02:59:30.143  
and on the inside you see this beautiful feminine form

4703
02:59:30.143 --> 02:59:31.812  
of dark, brown skin,

4704
02:59:31.812 --> 02:59:34.662  
light fiery red hair,

4705
02:59:34.662 --> 02:59:36.309  
just luminous space there.

4706
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:37.533  
As she puts her hands out,

4707
02:59:37.533 --> 02:59:39.980  
you watch as these bright radiant chains

4708
02:59:39.980 --> 02:59:41.832  
of burning light

4709
02:59:41.832 --> 02:59:45.700  
just begin to wrap around her forearms.

4710
02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:46.891  
She releases them forward

4711
02:59:46.891 --> 02:59:50.083  
and they spin around the creature

4712
02:59:50.083 --> 02:59:52.628  
and they don't pass through its form.

4713
02:59:52.628 --> 02:59:53.870  
The divine energies of this

4714
02:59:53.870 --> 02:59:56.513  
resist the fact that it's not a physical attack

4715
02:59:56.513 --> 02:59:58.365  
and you watch as the chains tighten

4716
02:59:58.365 --> 03:00:00.365  
and she grabs and pulls.

4717
03:00:01.887 --> 03:00:03.837  
You watch as this avatar of Sarenrae

4718
03:00:03.837 --> 03:00:05.798  
or possibly Sarenrae herself,

4719
03:00:05.798 --> 03:00:09.514  
as you are past the Divine Gate,

4720
03:00:09.514 --> 03:00:12.191  
drags backward

4721
03:00:12.191 --> 03:00:14.024  
and the creature

4722
03:00:17.991 --> 03:00:19.149
is pulled back

4723
03:00:19.149 --> 03:00:23.361  
and is currently grappled and restrained by Sarenrae.

4724
03:00:23.361 --> 03:00:25.743  
TRAVIS: Oh, Sarenrae!

4725
03:00:25.743 --> 03:00:27.255  
MARISHA: Is Pike dragged with him?

4726
03:00:27.255 --> 03:00:30.855  
MATT: Yeah, Pike is still inside of it.

4727
03:00:30.855 --> 03:00:34.954  
SAM: Wow, restrained by a god.

4728
03:00:34.954 --> 03:00:36.771  
ASHLEY: I know that grappling wouldn't work for him,

4729
03:00:36.771 --> 03:00:39.154  
but I was like, maybe with a god?

4730
03:00:39.154 --> 03:00:40.745  
MATT: For perspective, that's where it's at because

4731
03:00:40.745 --> 03:00:42.036
that's where the ceremony would be.

4732
03:00:42.036 --> 03:00:43.566  
I do not-- off hand.

4733
03:00:43.566 --> 03:00:44.856  
I'm not going to run back there again.

4734
03:00:44.856 --> 03:00:45.982  
SAM: Okay.

4735
03:00:45.982 --> 03:00:48.163  
TALIESIN: If something is physically moved,

4736
03:00:48.163 --> 03:00:49.554  
the grapple moves with it?

4737
03:00:49.554 --> 03:00:53.062
MARISHA: I thought it breaks. The restraint.

4738
03:00:54.651 --> 03:00:58.027  
MATT: No, I think you're correct, actually.

4739
03:00:58.027 --> 03:00:59.471  
TALIESIN: It doesn't solve all the problems,

4740
03:00:59.471 --> 03:01:01.142  
but it solves one of them.

4741
03:01:01.142 --> 03:01:05.394  
MATT: It's sticky because it's engulfing you.

4742
03:01:05.394 --> 03:01:07.242  
It's not so much that it's just holding you in place.

4743
03:01:07.242 --> 03:01:08.825  
It's engulfing you.

4744
03:01:10.681 --> 03:01:12.514  
LAURA: That makes sense, that makes sense.

4745
03:01:12.514 --> 03:01:14.299  
MATT: I'll say no, it holds onto you.

4746
03:01:14.299 --> 03:01:15.869  
Normally, if it was just a simple grapple, yes,

4747
03:01:15.869 --> 03:01:17.741  
but this is like it's engulfed you in its fist

4748
03:01:17.741 --> 03:01:19.476  
and because it's being dragged back,

4749
03:01:19.476 --> 03:01:20.684  
you're still being pulled with it.

4750
03:01:20.684 --> 03:01:21.642  
ASHLEY: Okay.

4751
03:01:21.642 --> 03:01:23.063  
Then I don't know--

4752
03:01:23.063 --> 03:01:24.288  
TALIESIN: Did the grasping vine also--

4753
03:01:24.288 --> 03:01:26.205  
no, never mind, that was Keyleth's, never mind.

4754
03:01:26.205 --> 03:01:27.740  
ASHLEY: So I don't know if this is going to work

4755
03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:30.303  
but as a bonus action,

4756
03:01:30.303 --> 03:01:33.778  
I am also going to

4757
03:01:34.961 --> 03:01:38.379
summon the Blessing of the Everlight

4758
03:01:38.379 --> 03:01:41.367  
and poof out my wings

4759
03:01:41.367 --> 03:01:45.609  
and try to maybe try to get out.

4760
03:01:45.609 --> 03:01:46.580  
MATT: Okay.

4761
03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:48.864  
This is from which one?

4762
03:01:48.864 --> 03:01:50.477  
ASHLEY: Blessing of the Everlight,

4763
03:01:50.477 --> 03:01:51.715  
as a bonus action,

4764
03:01:51.715 --> 03:01:53.268  
you can summon the wings of the Everlight

4765
03:01:53.268 --> 03:01:54.263  
granting you--

4766
03:01:54.263 --> 03:01:55.156  
MATT: Right, this is from the blessing

4767
03:01:55.156 --> 03:01:56.363  
that you received from her, yes.

4768
03:01:56.363 --> 03:01:58.588  
So you get the fly speed.

4769
03:01:58.588 --> 03:01:59.671  
ASHLEY: 40 feet.

4770
03:01:59.671 --> 03:02:01.588  
Works up to ten minutes.

4771
03:02:02.593 --> 03:02:04.018  
Any spells you cast

4772
03:02:04.018 --> 03:02:05.836  
that cause creatures to regain hit points,

4773
03:02:05.836 --> 03:02:07.919  
heal an additional ten HP.

4774
03:02:08.999 --> 03:02:10.796  
It'll help me get out but--

4775
03:02:10.796 --> 03:02:12.400  
MATT: It doesn't at the moment,

4776
03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:14.475  
but you have wings and you have a fly speed.

4777
03:02:14.475 --> 03:02:15.887  
When it comes around to your next turn,

4778
03:02:15.887 --> 03:02:16.720  
you can use an action

4779
03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:18.254  
to try and break free from its grapple,

4780
03:02:18.254 --> 03:02:21.492  
if somebody else doesn't help you out of there either way.

4781
03:02:21.492 --> 03:02:22.450  
Okay, that finish your turn?

4782
03:02:22.450 --> 03:02:23.283  
ASHLEY: Yes.

4783
03:02:23.283 --> 03:02:24.949  
MATT: Okay. Ending Pike's turn,

4784
03:02:24.949 --> 03:02:27.873  
it is now the dust titan's turn.

4785
03:02:27.873 --> 03:02:29.561  
MARISHA, SAM, and TRAVIS: The dust titan?

4786
03:02:29.561 --> 03:02:31.710  
MATT: Yes.

4787
03:02:31.710 --> 03:02:34.710  
He gains his legendary actions back.

4788
03:02:37.083 --> 03:02:38.042  
It is grappled and restrained,

4789
03:02:38.042 --> 03:02:40.016  
so it has disadvantage on its attacks and it's

4790
03:02:42.266 --> 03:02:43.397
going to use its action

4791
03:02:43.397 --> 03:02:44.424  
to try and break free of the grapple.

4792
03:02:44.424 --> 03:02:46.167  
TALIESIN: What it is that, by the way?
MATT: Hmm?

4793
03:02:46.167 --> 03:02:47.648  
TALIESIN: What do you use to break free of a grapple?

4794
03:02:47.648 --> 03:02:49.980  
MATT: It's a strength check, which it has disadvantage on.

4795
03:02:49.980 --> 03:02:51.345  
TALIESIN: Okay, good.
MATT: Yes, because of the Hex.

4796
03:02:51.345 --> 03:02:52.303  
TALIESIN: Just double checking.

4797
03:02:53.186 --> 03:02:54.838  
MATT: But this is against Sarenrae,

4798
03:02:54.838 --> 03:02:56.108  
which I need you to roll for.

4799
03:02:56.108 --> 03:03:00.500  
Roll a d20 and add ten to it.

4800
03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:03.764  
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, it's a Sarenrae die.

4801
03:03:03.764 --> 03:03:04.732  
Let's do this one.

4802
03:03:04.732 --> 03:03:06.315  
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

4803
03:03:07.249 --> 03:03:08.082  
ASHLEY: Okay.

4804
03:03:09.277 --> 03:03:10.410
LAURA: And add ten.

4805
03:03:10.410 --> 03:03:11.451  
ASHLEY: 21.

4806
03:03:11.451 --> 03:03:12.812  
MATT: 17.

4807
03:03:12.812 --> 03:03:13.785
MARISHA: Yes!

4808
03:03:13.785 --> 03:03:14.908  
MATT: It uses an action

4809
03:03:14.908 --> 03:03:17.221  
to try and break free from the chains, failed.

4810
03:03:17.221 --> 03:03:18.646  
However, I should've remembered,

4811
03:03:18.646 --> 03:03:19.494
at the beginning of its turn

4812
03:03:19.494 --> 03:03:20.680  
because you are still held by it,

4813
03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:23.787  
you do, every creature that's grappled by it

4814
03:03:23.787 --> 03:03:26.462  
takes 24 piercing damage which is reduced to 12,

4815
03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:27.615  
so you take 12 more piercing damage

4816
03:03:27.615 --> 03:03:28.695  
while you're engulfed there.

4817
03:03:28.695 --> 03:03:29.528  
ASHLEY: Hold on.

4818
03:03:30.730 --> 03:03:32.747  
MATT: But yeah, it fails to break the grapple

4819
03:03:32.747 --> 03:03:35.080  
and that's its action, shit.

4820
03:03:35.992 --> 03:03:37.476  
Divine Intervention, man.

4821
03:03:37.476 --> 03:03:38.559  
TALIESIN: 20.

4822
03:03:38.559 --> 03:03:39.721  
MATT: Yeah, that's what it is.

4823
03:03:39.721 --> 03:03:41.071  
All right, that's going to end the titan's turn.

4824
03:03:41.071 --> 03:03:43.233  
We have Lieve'tel and Scanlan. What are you doing?

4825
03:03:43.233 --> 03:03:45.626  
LIAM: Lieve'tel is going to hold her hand out

4826
03:03:45.626 --> 03:03:48.808  
and claw the air and say: Fail,

4827
03:03:48.808 --> 03:03:53.089  
and use Path to the Grave to curse the creature.

4828
03:03:53.089 --> 03:03:56.373  
Next time an ally hits it with an attack,

4829
03:03:56.373 --> 03:03:57.630  
the creature has vulnerability

4830
03:03:57.630 --> 03:03:59.349  
to all of that attack's damage

4831
03:03:59.349 --> 03:04:00.554  
and then the curse ends.

4832
03:04:00.554 --> 03:04:02.209  
As a bonus,

4833
03:04:02.209 --> 03:04:07.209  
I'm going to cast Healing Word on Pike at level eight.

4834
03:04:07.731 --> 03:04:09.466  
SAM: Oh wow. Level eight?

4835
03:04:09.466 --> 03:04:10.674  
LIAM: Yes.

4836
03:04:10.674 --> 03:04:14.099  
SAM: That's a big old fat Healing Word.
MATT: Yeah.

4837
03:04:14.099 --> 03:04:17.307  
LIAM: So give me a moment.

4838
03:04:19.593 --> 03:04:22.069  
MARISHA: I'm now in my air elemental form,

4839
03:04:22.069 --> 03:04:23.971  
which is now full.

4840
03:04:23.971 --> 03:04:25.082  
LAURA: Sweet.

4841
03:04:25.082 --> 03:04:26.429  
ASHLEY: 84?

4842
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:28.510  
LIAM: No, no, no, I'm going to roll it for you.

4843
03:04:28.510 --> 03:04:29.868  
SAM: 8d4.

4844
03:04:32.667 --> 03:04:33.500  
TRAVIS: 84?

4845
03:04:34.375 --> 03:04:35.816  
Oh, Pike.

4846
03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:37.765  
You silly.

4847
03:04:38.765 --> 03:04:40.848  
TALIESIN: So you can hold a heal, but yeah.

4848
03:04:42.614 --> 03:04:44.281  
LIAM: Fuck this die, 11.

4849
03:04:45.905 --> 03:04:46.738  
12.

4850
03:04:48.036 --> 03:04:48.869  
13.

4851
03:04:49.956 --> 03:04:51.528  
16.

4852
03:04:51.528 --> 03:04:55.511  
19 plus four is 23.

4853
03:04:55.511 --> 03:04:57.850  
So 23 points.
ASHLEY: That's great.

4854
03:04:57.850 --> 03:04:59.991  
LIAM: Then I will use my movement

4855
03:04:59.991 --> 03:05:04.727  
to back around the mechanical creature there with me.

4856
03:05:04.727 --> 03:05:06.368
MATT: 20, 25.
LIAM: Yes.

4857
03:05:08.489 --> 03:05:11.300  
MATT: Yep, you can move 30.

4858
03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:13.367  
You can get right there next to Bob.

4859
03:05:13.367 --> 03:05:14.418  
TALIESIN: Are we all joining Bob?

4860
03:05:14.418 --> 03:05:15.663  
All right.

4861
03:05:15.663 --> 03:05:17.554  
MARISHA: Grouping up around Bob.
SAM: Do we have all our stuff?

4862
03:05:17.554 --> 03:05:19.352  
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

4863
03:05:19.352 --> 03:05:20.460  
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

4864
03:05:20.460 --> 03:05:23.682  
MARISHA: Pike's stuff, Bag of Holding, and the tuning fork.

4865
03:05:23.682 --> 03:05:25.997  
LIAM: Next attack on him, though, is doubled

4866
03:05:25.997 --> 03:05:26.891  
because it's vulnerable.

4867
03:05:26.891 --> 03:05:30.274  
If you get a critical, it will be quadrupled.

4868
03:05:30.274 --> 03:05:31.107  
MATT: Okay.

4869
03:05:31.107 --> 03:05:31.940  
End of your turns.

4870
03:05:31.940 --> 03:05:32.773  
Going to use legendary action

4871
03:05:32.773 --> 03:05:34.856  
and it's going to try and break again.

4872
03:05:34.856 --> 03:05:39.175  
Roll another Sarenrae die, if you don't mind.

4873
03:05:39.175 --> 03:05:40.298  
Disadvantage.

4874
03:05:40.298 --> 03:05:41.131  
ASHLEY: With a disadvantage?

4875
03:05:41.131 --> 03:05:42.964  
MATT: No, I have disadvantage.

4876
03:05:42.964 --> 03:05:43.797  
ASHLEY: Okay.

4877
03:05:45.338 --> 03:05:46.171  
MATT: What'd you roll?

4878
03:05:46.171 --> 03:05:47.004  
ASHLEY: 23.

4879
03:05:47.004 --> 03:05:48.212  
MATT: 24.

4880
03:05:48.212 --> 03:05:49.795  
ASHLEY: Can I, as Pike, use

4881
03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:54.997  
War God's Blessing--

4882
03:05:54.997 --> 03:05:56.865  
MATT: That gives plus ten to an attack roll

4883
03:05:56.865 --> 03:05:58.975  
to somebody nearby if, I recall, unless I'm wrong.

4884
03:05:58.975 --> 03:06:00.454  
ASHLEY: Yes, plus ten to attack.

4885
03:06:00.454 --> 03:06:01.512  
Oh, this is was a--

4886
03:06:01.512 --> 03:06:02.951  
MATT: This was for him to break free.

4887
03:06:02.951 --> 03:06:04.355  
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry, yes, yes, yes,

4888
03:06:04.355 --> 03:06:05.339  
okay.
MATT: That's okay.

4889
03:06:05.339 --> 03:06:06.172  
Okay.

4890
03:06:07.047 --> 03:06:09.432  
So just the chains break free,

4891
03:06:09.432 --> 03:06:12.143  
but he's pulled back and has wasted an entire round.

4892
03:06:12.143 --> 03:06:14.183
ASHLEY: Okay.

4893
03:06:14.183 --> 03:06:18.691  
MATT: That ends, that's Lieve'tel's turn. Scanlan?

4894
03:06:18.691 --> 03:06:20.079  
SAM: Are you still grappled in there?

4895
03:06:20.079 --> 03:06:20.912  
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4896
03:06:20.912 --> 03:06:22.620  
SAM: Okay.

4897
03:06:28.396 --> 03:06:30.921  
I will use Bigby's Hand

4898
03:06:32.556 --> 03:06:37.357  
to push Pike out of him.

4899
03:06:37.357 --> 03:06:38.315  
MATT: Okay!

4900
03:06:38.315 --> 03:06:42.102  
Moving the hand up in towards the grasp where it has her.

4901
03:06:42.102 --> 03:06:46.468  
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your

4902
03:06:46.468 --> 03:06:48.418
charisma modifier.

4903
03:06:49.707 --> 03:06:51.873  
SAM: 19 plus charisma?

4904
03:06:51.873 --> 03:06:52.706  
MATT: Yes.

4905
03:06:52.706 --> 03:06:53.664  
SAM: That's a lot.

4906
03:06:53.664 --> 03:06:55.725  
I'm a charismatic son of a bitch.

4907
03:06:55.725 --> 03:06:58.735  
Plus six, so that's 25.

4908
03:06:58.735 --> 03:06:59.998  
MATT: 23 was what it rolled.

4909
03:06:59.998 --> 03:07:01.430  
So 13 plus ten.

4910
03:07:01.430 --> 03:07:03.480  
So you managed to push Pike.

4911
03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:06.697  
The hand just palms Pike

4912
03:07:06.697 --> 03:07:09.198  
and shoves you out of his grasp.

4913
03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:13.078  
ASHLEY: Awesome.
MATT: So you skid

4914
03:07:13.078 --> 03:07:14.921  
right there on the ground.

4915
03:07:14.921 --> 03:07:16.161  
The hand just takes you

4916
03:07:16.161 --> 03:07:18.458  
and holding like a basketball

4917
03:07:18.458 --> 03:07:20.030  
and rests you on the ground.

4918
03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:24.280  
SAM: It says that I can push a creature five feet plus

4919
03:07:25.584 --> 03:07:30.575  
five feet times my spell casting ability modifier

4920
03:07:31.433 --> 03:07:35.481  
which is another 30 feet.

4921
03:07:35.481 --> 03:07:37.130  
MARISHA: You can drag her all the way towards Bob.

4922
03:07:37.130 --> 03:07:38.717  
MATT: You can't drag her. Push.

4923
03:07:38.717 --> 03:07:40.545  
SAM: Can I push her all the way to Grog?

4924
03:07:40.545 --> 03:07:41.978  
MATT: If you push her any further through

4925
03:07:41.978 --> 03:07:43.069
where the hand was,

4926
03:07:43.069 --> 03:07:44.594  
you're going to push her into the stone wall.

4927
03:07:44.594 --> 03:07:46.115  
SAM: Oh, can I push the other way?

4928
03:07:46.115 --> 03:07:48.909  
MATT: Well, the push is basically--

4929
03:07:48.909 --> 03:07:50.242  
it's not like a--

4930
03:07:52.552 --> 03:07:54.769  
it's a push in a single direction.

4931
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:56.902
SAM: All right. Cool, that's fine.

4932
03:07:56.902 --> 03:07:57.883
MATT: Because you were over here,

4933
03:07:57.883 --> 03:07:59.028  
you can move five, ten.

4934
03:07:59.028 --> 03:08:00.268  
How much can you move the hand

4935
03:08:00.268 --> 03:08:02.053  
before you do a thing?

4936
03:08:02.053 --> 03:08:04.303
SAM: Oh boy! (fake crying)

4937
03:08:08.726 --> 03:08:10.766  
SAM: This thing is the worst.

4938
03:08:10.766 --> 03:08:12.763  
Don't worry, it's not D&D Beyond.

4939
03:08:12.763 --> 03:08:13.596
TALIESIN: Really?

4940
03:08:16.348 --> 03:08:17.958  
LIAM: (reading) "You can move the hand up to 60 feet

4941
03:08:17.958 --> 03:08:19.505  
"and then cause one of the following effects."

4942
03:08:19.505 --> 03:08:21.645  
SAM: So let's go all the way around.

4943
03:08:21.645 --> 03:08:23.319  
MATT: But you can do that.

4944
03:08:23.319 --> 03:08:26.585  
You can go there and then shove her this way.

4945
03:08:26.585 --> 03:08:29.332  
Then you push her to there, we'll allow that.

4946
03:08:29.332 --> 03:08:30.656  
That's good to know.

4947
03:08:30.656 --> 03:08:33.631  
So you do push her and rest her down that side.

4948
03:08:33.631 --> 03:08:34.856  
There you go.

4949
03:08:34.856 --> 03:08:37.655  
SAM: That's my bonus action.

4950
03:08:38.852 --> 03:08:40.177  
Oh boy.

4951
03:08:41.464 --> 03:08:43.108  
TALIESIN: Yeah, you got to get over to us, man.

4952
03:08:43.108 --> 03:08:44.441  
MARISHA: You got to get over there.
ASHLEY: Bamf over.

4953
03:08:44.441 --> 03:08:49.441  
SAM: I will Dimension Door to where Vex is.

4954
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:51.711  
LAURA: Up to me? Why me?

4955
03:08:51.711 --> 03:08:53.227  
TRAVIS: Make a chain, make a chain, make a chain.

4956
03:08:53.227 --> 03:08:54.465  
MARISHA: Go down.
SAM: I don't know

4957
03:08:54.465 --> 03:08:55.298  
where we're supposed to go.

4958
03:08:55.298 --> 03:08:56.218  
LAURA: No, I can jump down, I can jump down.

4959
03:08:56.218 --> 03:08:57.884  
MATT: He doesn't know. What are you doing?

4960
03:08:57.884 --> 03:08:59.028  
SAM: I went there, that's what I said.

4961
03:08:59.028 --> 03:09:01.053  
LAURA: Well, that's fine.

4962
03:09:01.053 --> 03:09:01.905  
That's fine, I'll use--

4963
03:09:01.905 --> 03:09:02.738  
SAM: That's it.

4964
03:09:02.738 --> 03:09:04.829  
MATT: All right, that finishes Scanlan's go.

4965
03:09:04.829 --> 03:09:09.829  
All right, at the end of Scanlan and Lieve'tel's turn,

4966
03:09:10.251 --> 03:09:14.751  
titan's going to use two legendary actions to shift form.

4967
03:09:16.326 --> 03:09:18.223  
SAM: Whoa.
LAURA: Oh no.

4968
03:09:18.223 --> 03:09:20.852  
MATT: Still Hexed.
SAM: I bet he's up at full strength again.

4969
03:09:20.852 --> 03:09:23.506  
MATT: Still Hunter's Marked.

4970
03:09:23.506 --> 03:09:24.339  
All righty.

4971
03:09:24.339 --> 03:09:25.250  
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

4972
03:09:25.250 --> 03:09:27.247  
MATT: That brings us to Bertrand Bell's turn.

4973
03:09:27.247 --> 03:09:30.673  
TRAVIS: Oh god!

4974
03:09:30.673 --> 03:09:32.709  
I swayed the group.

4975
03:09:32.709 --> 03:09:34.228  
I want to go home.

4976
03:09:34.228 --> 03:09:37.352  
I'll just try and make more of a chain

4977
03:09:37.352 --> 03:09:41.502  
between anybody and the people that are up on the pedestal.

4978
03:09:41.502 --> 03:09:43.880  
So I'll just put myself in a line, yeah.

4979
03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:44.908  
MATT: Like next to Lieve'tel there?

4980
03:09:44.908 --> 03:09:45.741  
TRAVIS: Sure, that sounds great.

4981
03:09:45.741 --> 03:09:47.497  
And I cry for my action.

4982
03:09:47.497 --> 03:09:49.951  
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.

4983
03:09:49.951 --> 03:09:51.206  
It's now the golem's turn.

4984
03:09:51.206 --> 03:09:52.249  
The golem is going to go ahead

4985
03:09:52.249 --> 03:09:56.857  
and move up over here on the side.

4986
03:09:57.919 --> 03:09:58.763  
There's the grasping vine.

4987
03:09:58.763 --> 03:10:01.119  
Make two strikes.

4988
03:10:01.119 --> 03:10:04.686  
Misses since armor class goes up in this form

4989
03:10:04.686 --> 03:10:07.835  
and misses with a natural two.

4990
03:10:07.835 --> 03:10:09.691  
It's hitting it, you're watching sparks fly,

4991
03:10:09.691 --> 03:10:12.764  
but now that the dust storm is returned

4992
03:10:12.764 --> 03:10:16.338  
and become the super hardened

4993
03:10:16.338 --> 03:10:18.040  
sandstone type body,

4994
03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:19.760  
the blade of this golem

4995
03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.340  
is just streaking across it

4996
03:10:21.340 --> 03:10:22.918  
carving these slight lines,

4997
03:10:22.918 --> 03:10:25.083  
but doing no actual damage.

4998
03:10:25.083 --> 03:10:25.927  
That ends the golem's turn.

4999
03:10:25.927 --> 03:10:28.093  
Top of the round, Percy, you're up.

5000
03:10:28.093 --> 03:10:29.512  
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop back over

5001
03:10:29.512 --> 03:10:31.569  
and find a place in the line

5002
03:10:31.569 --> 03:10:32.850  
with everybody else.

5003
03:10:32.850 --> 03:10:34.862  
MARISHA: If we can daisy chain it to Grog,

5004
03:10:34.862 --> 03:10:36.720  
we might be able to get out this turn.

5005
03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:38.511  
TALIESIN: Oh, holy cut.
LAURA: That's what I mean,

5006
03:10:38.511 --> 03:10:41.382  
if I can hop down, if I can grab Scanlan and jump down--

5007
03:10:41.382 --> 03:10:42.490  
SAM: Did you get all your stuff?

5008
03:10:42.490 --> 03:10:43.698  
MARISHA: Yeah.

5009
03:10:43.698 --> 03:10:46.074  
LAURA: I mean, I got the Bag of Holding.

5010
03:10:46.074 --> 03:10:47.768  
SAM: What else we we missing?

5011
03:10:47.768 --> 03:10:50.985  
MARISHA: Nothing. Nothing we can't replace.

5012
03:10:50.985 --> 03:10:52.598  
SAM: Pikey?

5013
03:10:52.598 --> 03:10:53.732  
ASHLEY: Somebody has my bag.

5014
03:10:53.732 --> 03:10:55.601  
LAURA: Yeah, Bertrand Bell has--

5015
03:10:55.601 --> 03:10:56.560  
MARISHA: Yeah, Bob grabbed--

5016
03:10:56.560 --> 03:10:58.143  
LAURA: Grabbed your bag.

5017
03:10:58.143 --> 03:11:00.611  
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop over.

5018
03:11:00.611 --> 03:11:02.289  
I will miss the rings

5019
03:11:02.289 --> 03:11:04.198  
and I'm going to run to Grog.

5020
03:11:04.198 --> 03:11:05.156  
MARISHA: Yeah.

5021
03:11:05.156 --> 03:11:06.991  
MATT: Hop over this?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5022
03:11:06.991 --> 03:11:10.574  
MATT: All right, five, ten.

5023
03:11:10.574 --> 03:11:12.112  
TALIESIN: Cleanest way.

5024
03:11:12.112 --> 03:11:15.140  
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30,

5025
03:11:15.140 --> 03:11:16.201  
that's where you can get with your movement.

5026
03:11:16.201 --> 03:11:17.640  
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to burn more

5027
03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:20.480  
for a little bit more movement. I'm going to burn an action.

5028
03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:22.249  
MATT: Okay, burn an action.

5029
03:11:22.249 --> 03:11:24.104  
You get up to Grog there, you mean?

5030
03:11:24.104 --> 03:11:26.700  
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to get on top of Grog

5031
03:11:26.700 --> 03:11:29.874  
and try and-- so that, no, I'm just going to sit there.

5032
03:11:29.874 --> 03:11:32.441  
Never mind. Okay, I'm there,

5033
03:11:32.441 --> 03:11:34.344  
did I have to burn an action for that?

5034
03:11:34.344 --> 03:11:36.027  
MATT: You did.

5035
03:11:37.711 --> 03:11:39.230  
LAURA: Maybe just hop down to Bertrand.

5036
03:11:39.230 --> 03:11:40.591  
Never mind.
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

5037
03:11:40.591 --> 03:11:41.762  
MATT: It's fine, what are you doing?

5038
03:11:41.762 --> 03:11:44.371  
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold--

5039
03:11:44.371 --> 03:11:45.754  
I'm going to hold a gun attack

5040
03:11:45.754 --> 03:11:47.778  
in case it starts to move towards us.

5041
03:11:47.778 --> 03:11:49.444  
MATT: You used your action, you can't hold a gun.

5042
03:11:49.444 --> 03:11:52.175  
TALIESIN: Oh, not even with an action surge?

5043
03:11:52.175 --> 03:11:53.779  
MATT: Sure, if you want to action surge

5044
03:11:53.779 --> 03:11:56.146  
and then hold that action, I'll allow it.

5045
03:11:56.146 --> 03:11:57.812  
TALIESIN: All right. That was an action surge.

5046
03:11:57.812 --> 03:12:00.812  
I'm holding my real action to make a

5047
03:12:03.393 --> 03:12:06.072  
push attack, yeah, a shot against

5048
03:12:06.072 --> 03:12:07.231  
against him.

5049
03:12:07.231 --> 03:12:08.939  
MATT: Against him? Okay, cool.

5050
03:12:08.939 --> 03:12:10.605  
That finishes your go, Percy. Vex.

5051
03:12:10.605 --> 03:12:11.563  
LAURA: Okay.

5052
03:12:11.563 --> 03:12:14.381  
I'm going to grab Scanlan.

5053
03:12:14.381 --> 03:12:15.214  
SAM: Hi!
LAURA: Can I do that?

5054
03:12:15.214 --> 03:12:16.672  
Hop on my broom.

5055
03:12:16.672 --> 03:12:18.589  
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Oh boy.

5056
03:12:19.491 --> 03:12:23.141  
LAURA: Just make an easy little jaunt down to the ground.

5057
03:12:23.141 --> 03:12:24.501  
MATT: Okay.

5058
03:12:24.501 --> 03:12:26.267  
LAURA: Simple, simple.
SAM: Oh god.

5059
03:12:26.267 --> 03:12:27.160  
MATT: What's the speed of your broom?

5060
03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:29.023  
LAURA: I like that I started the game with a voice.

5061
03:12:29.023 --> 03:12:30.289  
MATT: I know, you poor thing.

5062
03:12:30.289 --> 03:12:31.997  
LAURA: What the fuck?

5063
03:12:31.997 --> 03:12:33.256  
ASHLEY: You sound really cool.

5064
03:12:33.256 --> 03:12:34.470  
MARISHA: Almost done.

5065
03:12:34.470 --> 03:12:36.402  
MATT: All right, so you grab Scanlan, you get on the broom.

5066
03:12:36.402 --> 03:12:39.235  
What's the movement on the broom?

5067
03:12:39.235 --> 03:12:41.629  
LIAM: 60 feet, I think.
LAURA: 60 feet.

5068
03:12:41.629 --> 03:12:43.580  
MATT: So with him on it--
LIAM: It's normal, 60.

5069
03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:45.977  
MATT: Right. Grabbing him,

5070
03:12:45.977 --> 03:12:47.631  
normally when you're carrying somebody with you

5071
03:12:47.631 --> 03:12:48.632  
it's half movement to move.

5072
03:12:48.632 --> 03:12:50.574  
So I'll say 30 feet.

5073
03:12:50.574 --> 03:12:52.409  
Anyway, go ahead and make a strength

5074
03:12:52.409 --> 03:12:53.566  
or an athletics check

5075
03:12:53.566 --> 03:12:55.990  
to deal with the wind

5076
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:59.585  
as you attempt to make the broom--

5077
03:12:59.585 --> 03:13:01.664  
LAURA: If the broom starts to go,

5078
03:13:01.664 --> 03:13:05.169  
I'm just going to bail and jump to the ground,

5079
03:13:05.169 --> 03:13:06.206  
just letting you know.

5080
03:13:06.206 --> 03:13:07.972  
SAM: Thanks.

5081
03:13:09.934 --> 03:13:11.267  
LAURA: Athletics, 13.

5082
03:13:12.431 --> 03:13:14.663  
LIAM: That good old twin athletics.

5083
03:13:14.663 --> 03:13:17.226  
MATT: As you begin to head down,

5084
03:13:17.226 --> 03:13:19.160  
the broom begins to (fluttering)

5085
03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:20.133  
and curl up.

5086
03:13:20.133 --> 03:13:21.774  
You said you're going to ditch?

5087
03:13:21.774 --> 03:13:23.512  
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it, just jump.

5088
03:13:23.512 --> 03:13:26.104  
LAURA: Yeah, I wasn't coming up before I was going down.

5089
03:13:26.104 --> 03:13:27.096  
MATT: No, I realize that.

5090
03:13:27.096 --> 03:13:29.904  
As you began to move forward, the wind picked it up

5091
03:13:29.904 --> 03:13:30.981  
because that's what it does.

5092
03:13:30.981 --> 03:13:32.016  
LAURA: Yeah, fuck it.

5093
03:13:32.016 --> 03:13:34.099  
I'm bailing, I'm going to try to hold on to Scanlan

5094
03:13:34.099 --> 03:13:35.323  
and take a land

5095
03:13:36.547 --> 03:13:38.471  
and acrobatics my way onto the ground.

5096
03:13:38.471 --> 03:13:39.934  
MATT: All right, so acrobatics check,

5097
03:13:39.934 --> 03:13:41.796  
acrobatics check with disadvantage.

5098
03:13:41.796 --> 03:13:43.321  
SAM: Okay.

5099
03:13:45.227 --> 03:13:46.060  
LAURA: 30.

5100
03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:47.726  
SAM: Jesus.
LAURA: I'm holding onto Scanlan

5101
03:13:47.726 --> 03:13:50.309  
to try to protect him.

5102
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:51.559  
SAM: That's a two.

5103
03:13:53.378 --> 03:13:54.811  
Plus six.

5104
03:13:54.811 --> 03:13:55.893  
Eight.
MATT: So that's eight.

5105
03:13:55.893 --> 03:13:56.726  
Okay.

5106
03:13:56.726 --> 03:13:59.448  
So you allowed him an acrobatics check.

5107
03:13:59.448 --> 03:14:02.846  
What was the first roll you did?

5108
03:14:02.846 --> 03:14:03.895  
SAM: I rolled twice

5109
03:14:03.895 --> 03:14:06.259  
and one was a nine and one was a two.

5110
03:14:06.259 --> 03:14:07.400  
I rolled them at the same time.

5111
03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:09.747  
MATT: Okay, so the nine was what your--

5112
03:14:09.747 --> 03:14:11.236  
I'll give you the higher of the two,

5113
03:14:11.236 --> 03:14:12.974  
because she was helping you.

5114
03:14:12.974 --> 03:14:14.436  
It would mitigate the disadvantage.

5115
03:14:14.436 --> 03:14:16.476  
SAM: Okay, 15 then.

5116
03:14:16.476 --> 03:14:17.309  
MATT: So 15, okay.

5117
03:14:17.309 --> 03:14:18.809  
So you reduce the...

5118
03:14:22.622 --> 03:14:25.951  
seven mitigated to three.

5119
03:14:25.951 --> 03:14:28.706  
Take three points of bludgeoning damage. You're fine.

5120
03:14:28.706 --> 03:14:30.729  
But you are prone as you fall

5121
03:14:30.729 --> 03:14:32.465  
because you did not succeed entirely.

5122
03:14:32.465 --> 03:14:33.590  
LAURA: Well, I'm still going to hold his hand.

5123
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:34.713
I'm still going to grab--

5124
03:14:34.713 --> 03:14:36.671  
MATT: That's fine.

5125
03:14:36.671 --> 03:14:37.904  
All right, that finishes your go?

5126
03:14:37.904 --> 03:14:39.078  
LAURA: Yeah.

5127
03:14:39.078 --> 03:14:39.911  
MATT: All right.

5128
03:14:39.911 --> 03:14:40.913  
It's Bob's turn.

5129
03:14:40.913 --> 03:14:43.191  
Bob's going to go over and grab some more stuff.

5130
03:14:43.191 --> 03:14:44.501  
MARISHA: Bob, no!

5131
03:14:44.501 --> 03:14:46.376  
TRAVIS: Fuck Bob! Who gives a shit?

5132
03:14:46.376 --> 03:14:48.301  
SAM: We promised him, Grog.

5133
03:14:48.301 --> 03:14:49.967  
TRAVIS: No, fuck that guy.
SAM: We made a promise!

5134
03:14:49.967 --> 03:14:51.050  
TRAVIS: Nope.

5135
03:14:52.092 --> 03:14:53.670  
SAM: Have to roll to maintain concentration.

5136
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:55.720  
MATT: He goes over. His speed is--

5137
03:14:57.124 --> 03:14:58.852  
actually speed is 40 while hovering.

5138
03:14:58.852 --> 03:15:01.282  
You actually watch him just glide over

5139
03:15:01.282 --> 03:15:05.416  
and he uses his action to grab a few books

5140
03:15:05.416 --> 03:15:06.853  
then gets more things

5141
03:15:06.853 --> 03:15:08.689  
and getting his belongings together,

5142
03:15:08.689 --> 03:15:11.731  
seems to be caught up in his own mind gathering things.

5143
03:15:11.731 --> 03:15:14.012  
That finishes his turn.

5144
03:15:14.012 --> 03:15:18.762  
Actually, he's going to make a legendary action to teleport.

5145
03:15:21.027 --> 03:15:22.777  
TALIESIN: Good boy, good boy.

5146
03:15:23.712 --> 03:15:24.545
MATT: (foomph) Appear here.

5147
03:15:24.545 --> 03:15:25.378
TALIESIN: Okay!

5148
03:15:27.627 --> 03:15:28.529  
MATT: That's going to finish his go.

5149
03:15:28.529 --> 03:15:29.612  
Keyleth, you're up.

5150
03:15:29.612 --> 03:15:31.205  
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action

5151
03:15:31.205 --> 03:15:34.538  
to have bamfed Trinket into my necklace?

5152
03:15:36.211 --> 03:15:37.873  
MATT: Trinket.

5153
03:15:37.873 --> 03:15:39.506  
LAURA: If he's in 100 feet of me.

5154
03:15:39.506 --> 03:15:41.256  
MATT: Yeah, I'll do that.

5155
03:15:43.652 --> 03:15:44.659  
You got it.

5156
03:15:44.659 --> 03:15:48.228  
That finishes Bob's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

5157
03:15:48.228 --> 03:15:51.889  
MARISHA: I'm going to fly down to Vex

5158
03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:54.689  
towards the Scanlan side.

5159
03:15:57.358 --> 03:15:59.024  
MATT: This side?
MARISHA: Yeah.

5160
03:15:59.024 --> 03:16:00.482  
Drop my form.

5161
03:16:00.482 --> 03:16:01.940  
MATT: Okay.

5162
03:16:01.940 --> 03:16:02.773  
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

5163
03:16:02.773 --> 03:16:04.594  
MARISHA: Back to one hit point.

5164
03:16:04.594 --> 03:16:06.760  
I grab the tuning fork.

5165
03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:09.593  
SAM: Should we take Sarenrae with us?

5166
03:16:10.795 --> 03:16:12.351  
MARISHA: I grab the tuning fork

5167
03:16:12.351 --> 03:16:13.893  
and then I'm going to--

5168
03:16:13.893 --> 03:16:15.331  
MATT: Are you going next to her

5169
03:16:15.331 --> 03:16:17.248  
or next to Scanlan? Right there, you mean?

5170
03:16:17.248 --> 03:16:19.019  
MARISHA: Yeah, whatever I can do to grab my tuning fork.

5171
03:16:19.019 --> 03:16:20.787  
MATT: Okay, so we have to get next to her there.

5172
03:16:20.787 --> 03:16:21.620  
TALIESIN: Who are we missing?

5173
03:16:21.620 --> 03:16:23.286  
TRAVIS: Pike.

5174
03:16:23.286 --> 03:16:24.119  
ASHLEY: That's okay, I'm close.

5175
03:16:24.119 --> 03:16:24.952  
MARISHA: Wait, where are you?

5176
03:16:24.952 --> 03:16:25.993  
SAM: She's over by the hand.

5177
03:16:25.993 --> 03:16:27.076  
TALIESIN: Over by the hand.

5178
03:16:27.076 --> 03:16:28.671  
LAURA: He's going to get to go--

5179
03:16:28.671 --> 03:16:31.329  
SAM: And Bob isn't touching anybody yet?

5180
03:16:31.329 --> 03:16:35.162  
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use the rest of my movement.

5181
03:16:36.461 --> 03:16:38.111  
I'm going to hold on

5182
03:16:38.111 --> 03:16:41.685  
to Scanlan's foot that's on the ground

5183
03:16:41.685 --> 03:16:44.744  
and I'm going to reach out and try and connect to everybody

5184
03:16:44.744 --> 03:16:47.899  
and I'm going to hold my action,

5185
03:16:47.899 --> 03:16:51.605  
my Plane Shift spell for as soon as we're all touching

5186
03:16:51.605 --> 03:16:52.943  
to go.

5187
03:16:52.943 --> 03:16:54.586  
MATT: Okay, so you're standing there

5188
03:16:54.586 --> 03:16:57.676  
in contact with Vex and Scanlan.

5189
03:16:57.676 --> 03:17:00.215  
MARISHA: I'll grab the fork from Vex,

5190
03:17:00.215 --> 03:17:03.836  
move over. I'm trying to connect this daisy chain

5191
03:17:03.836 --> 03:17:05.809  
with Scanlan.
MATT: So you move here

5192
03:17:05.809 --> 03:17:06.942
because you have 60 feet of

5193
03:17:06.942 --> 03:17:08.829
movement with your air form, right?

5194
03:17:08.829 --> 03:17:10.420  
MARISHA: 90.

5195
03:17:10.420 --> 03:17:11.578  
MATT: 90, all right.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5196
03:17:11.578 --> 03:17:12.411  
MATT: So I'll say by the time you transform,

5197
03:17:12.411 --> 03:17:14.014  
you've used a third of your movement to get down there.

5198
03:17:14.014 --> 03:17:14.847  
MARISHA: Yeah.

5199
03:17:14.847 --> 03:17:16.582  
MATT: So you have 20 feet of movement left.

5200
03:17:16.582 --> 03:17:19.796  
MARISHA: Okay, I was just grabbing the fork

5201
03:17:19.796 --> 03:17:22.022  
and then I want to connect this,

5202
03:17:22.022 --> 03:17:24.253  
I'm trying to connect this daisy chain

5203
03:17:24.253 --> 03:17:25.973  
with this group and Pike.

5204
03:17:25.973 --> 03:17:27.147  
So I want to be here,

5205
03:17:27.147 --> 03:17:28.718  
that way Pike can try and get here

5206
03:17:28.718 --> 03:17:30.883  
and then I think we should all be connected.

5207
03:17:30.883 --> 03:17:31.873  
MATT: So you're just moving here and that's your turn?

5208
03:17:31.873 --> 03:17:35.416  
MARISHA: Yes and grabbing onto Scanlan's foot

5209
03:17:35.416 --> 03:17:38.057  
and waiting and holding my spell.

5210
03:17:38.057 --> 03:17:39.596  
MATT: Okay, so you've now begun to cast--

5211
03:17:39.596 --> 03:17:41.680  
you've cast-- which one, Plane Shift?

5212
03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:42.513  
MARISHA: Plane Shift.

5213
03:17:42.513 --> 03:17:44.077  
MATT: And you are holding it until everyone's together.

5214
03:17:44.077 --> 03:17:46.111  
MARISHA: Until Pike latches on

5215
03:17:46.111 --> 03:17:47.499  
and we connect the daisy chain.

5216
03:17:47.499 --> 03:17:49.165  
MATT: You got it. Okay, that ends your turn.

5217
03:17:49.165 --> 03:17:50.079  
Grog, you're up.

5218
03:17:50.079 --> 03:17:51.412  
LAURA: Oh god.

5219
03:17:51.412 --> 03:17:54.207  
Oh Grog, you can maneuver and grab her.

5220
03:17:54.207 --> 03:17:55.072  
TRAVIS: Grab who?

5221
03:17:55.072 --> 03:17:55.905  
LAURA: Pike.

5222
03:17:55.905 --> 03:17:58.126  
TRAVIS: Don't I need to just touch Percy?

5223
03:17:58.126 --> 03:18:00.209  
LAURA: Yeah, but if you get Pike

5224
03:18:00.209 --> 03:18:02.117
before the bad guy gets Pike,

5225
03:18:02.117 --> 03:18:04.000  
you can complete the chain

5226
03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:04.909  
because you're on the end.

5227
03:18:04.909 --> 03:18:07.117  
SAM: She's a monster. There's a god behind her.

5228
03:18:07.117 --> 03:18:08.066  
TRAVIS: I don't think I can squeeze through there.

5229
03:18:08.066 --> 03:18:08.993  
I have 50 feet of movement.

5230
03:18:08.993 --> 03:18:10.596  
Could I squeeze through?

5231
03:18:10.596 --> 03:18:12.179  
MATT: You can move through allies,

5232
03:18:12.179 --> 03:18:13.374  
just step over them.

5233
03:18:13.374 --> 03:18:15.742  
TRAVIS: Do I have 50 feet to get over to where--

5234
03:18:15.742 --> 03:18:18.119  
to split Keyleth and Percy,

5235
03:18:18.119 --> 03:18:20.107  
I mean Keyleth and Pike?

5236
03:18:20.107 --> 03:18:23.464  
MATT: 30, you're there, 30 is right there.

5237
03:18:23.464 --> 03:18:26.550  
TRAVIS: Am I within reaching range of Pike?

5238
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:27.383  
MATT: No.

5239
03:18:28.758 --> 03:18:31.677  
TRAVIS: All right, fuck it, that's closer at least.

5240
03:18:31.677 --> 03:18:32.710  
TALIESIN: Am I no longer touching?

5241
03:18:32.710 --> 03:18:34.047  
Were you the end of the chain?

5242
03:18:34.047 --> 03:18:35.380
LAURA: He was the end.

5243
03:18:35.380 --> 03:18:37.347
So you're next me now.

5244
03:18:38.489 --> 03:18:40.018  
TRAVIS: She's just got to get to me.

5245
03:18:40.018 --> 03:18:42.113  
MATT: There is five people between Percy and Vex.

5246
03:18:42.113 --> 03:18:43.150  
TALIESIN: I don't think it was meant to--

5247
03:18:43.150 --> 03:18:44.969  
I mean, I would've preferred to be in a cluster,

5248
03:18:44.969 --> 03:18:46.427  
but I couldn't--

5249
03:18:46.427 --> 03:18:47.885  
MATT: You had to specify,

5250
03:18:47.885 --> 03:18:48.970  
if we're getting this fiddly.

5251
03:18:48.970 --> 03:18:50.318  
TALIESIN: So you weren't at the end of the chain?

5252
03:18:50.318 --> 03:18:52.310  
MATT: He was connecting you guys.

5253
03:18:52.310 --> 03:18:53.582  
He's no longer connecting you.

5254
03:18:53.582 --> 03:18:55.847  
TRAVIS: I want to stay at the end of the chain.

5255
03:18:55.847 --> 03:18:56.837  
TALIESIN: Sorry, that changes things.

5256
03:18:56.837 --> 03:18:58.358  
TRAVIS: Yeah, then I'll go back to where I was

5257
03:18:58.358 --> 03:19:00.407  
and just hold my action.

5258
03:19:00.407 --> 03:19:02.073  
Hold the whole thing. I'll just stay where I was.

5259
03:19:02.073 --> 03:19:04.321  
MATT: You're not doing that.

5260
03:19:04.321 --> 03:19:05.321  
You're backing up?

5261
03:19:05.321 --> 03:19:07.420  
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to be connected.

5262
03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:09.232  
MARISHA: Yeah, it looked like we were all connected.

5263
03:19:09.232 --> 03:19:11.373  
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Trying to connect, man.

5264
03:19:11.373 --> 03:19:12.381  
MATT: I understand.

5265
03:19:12.381 --> 03:19:16.052  
There's only so much I can keep backing things up

5266
03:19:16.052 --> 03:19:18.804  
before it starts getting a little frustrating.

5267
03:19:18.804 --> 03:19:20.631  
So you're holding there.

5268
03:19:20.631 --> 03:19:23.223  
That's your turn-- you're holding your action, for what?

5269
03:19:23.223 --> 03:19:24.153  
TRAVIS: Nothing.

5270
03:19:24.153 --> 03:19:26.858  
I literally give up my entire turn.

5271
03:19:26.858 --> 03:19:27.691  
MATT: Okay.

5272
03:19:27.691 --> 03:19:28.524  
LAURA: Oh god.

5273
03:19:29.448 --> 03:19:30.832  
MARISHA: Get out of here.
MATT: You got it.

5274
03:19:30.832 --> 03:19:32.800  
MARISHA: It all hinges on Pike.

5275
03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:33.676  
MATT: Pike, your turn.

5276
03:19:33.676 --> 03:19:35.516  
LAURA: It's your turn.
ASHLEY: It's my turn?

5277
03:19:35.516 --> 03:19:36.449  
Okay, okay, okay.

5278
03:19:36.449 --> 03:19:38.765  
So I'm just going to get to Bob.

5279
03:19:38.765 --> 03:19:39.598  
MATT: Okay.

5280
03:19:40.473 --> 03:19:41.447  
TALIESIN: Oh god.

5281
03:19:41.447 --> 03:19:43.030  
MATT: Moving to Bob.

5282
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:44.505  
MARISHA: No, no, no,

5283
03:19:44.505 --> 03:19:46.837  
connect Bertrand and--

5284
03:19:46.837 --> 03:19:49.874  
MATT: Run up and grab Bob's hand,

5285
03:19:49.874 --> 03:19:51.185  
and he holds your hand

5286
03:19:51.185 --> 03:19:53.913  
and you look over and between Bertrand and Keyleth

5287
03:19:53.913 --> 03:19:55.201  
there is a five foot gap.

5288
03:19:55.201 --> 03:19:56.092  
There is no chain.

5289
03:19:56.092 --> 03:19:57.334  
MARISHA: No, go in between us.

5290
03:19:57.334 --> 03:19:59.001  
ASHLEY: Sorry, I can't see.

5291
03:20:00.158 --> 03:20:01.056  
SAM: To be fair,

5292
03:20:01.056 --> 03:20:03.497
it has been awhile.

5293
03:20:03.497 --> 03:20:04.891  
ASHLEY: I thought they were connected.

5294
03:20:04.891 --> 03:20:07.401  
I'll go in, wherever the opening is.

5295
03:20:07.401 --> 03:20:10.302  
LIAM: If I'm next, I could fill the hole.

5296
03:20:10.302 --> 03:20:11.734  
SAM: Yeah, Lieve can fill the hole.

5297
03:20:11.734 --> 03:20:12.678  
MATT: 25.

5298
03:20:12.678 --> 03:20:15.499  
MARISHA: Well, you're already there Lieve, right?

5299
03:20:15.499 --> 03:20:16.548  
LIAM: Am I?

5300
03:20:16.548 --> 03:20:18.295  
Oh, I'm there, all right.
MARISHA: Yeah, you're there.

5301
03:20:18.295 --> 03:20:19.605  
TALIESIN: I was trying to look.

5302
03:20:19.605 --> 03:20:22.543  
I was trying to make sense of this madness.

5303
03:20:22.543 --> 03:20:23.487  
LAURA: We're all touching.

5304
03:20:23.487 --> 03:20:24.730  
MARISHA: We're all touching, right?

5305
03:20:24.730 --> 03:20:25.563  
ASHLEY: Where is Lieve?

5306
03:20:25.563 --> 03:20:28.352  
MATT: Seems to be.
LIAM: Next to Bertrand.

5307
03:20:28.352 --> 03:20:31.302  
MARISHA: Bamf! It looks like we're all connected.

5308
03:20:31.302 --> 03:20:34.778  
ASHLEY: I give a quick nod to Sarenrae of thank you.

5309
03:20:34.778 --> 03:20:37.802  
MARISHA: Do I see all of Vox Machina's hands connected?

5310
03:20:37.802 --> 03:20:38.803  
MATT: Make a perception check.

5311
03:20:38.803 --> 03:20:40.578  
SAM: Yes, look first.

5312
03:20:40.578 --> 03:20:42.035  
MARISHA: Want to make sure

5313
03:20:42.035 --> 03:20:44.576  
I see all of Vox Machina's hands connected.

5314
03:20:44.576 --> 03:20:45.587  
SAM: Plus Bob.

5315
03:20:45.587 --> 03:20:47.287  
MARISHA: I don't give a fuck about Bob,

5316
03:20:47.287 --> 03:20:48.695
to be totally honest.

5317
03:20:48.695 --> 03:20:50.680  
I'm kind of with Travis.

5318
03:20:51.584 --> 03:20:54.324  
If Bob-- fuck,

5319
03:20:54.324 --> 03:20:55.989  
that's real bad.

5320
03:20:55.989 --> 03:20:56.822  
SAM: Don't do it then.

5321
03:20:56.822 --> 03:20:57.655  
MARISHA: 14.

5322
03:20:57.655 --> 03:20:59.321  
SAM: Don't do it then.
MATT: 14?

5323
03:20:59.321 --> 03:21:00.387  
Looks like everyone's hands might be touching.

5324
03:21:00.387 --> 03:21:01.220  
What are you doing?

5325
03:21:01.220 --> 03:21:02.891  
SAM: Might be, oh god.

5326
03:21:02.891 --> 03:21:03.724  
MATT: What are you doing?

5327
03:21:03.724 --> 03:21:04.557  
ASHLEY: I think everyone's touching.

5328
03:21:04.557 --> 03:21:05.848  
LAURA: We knew what we were trying to do.

5329
03:21:05.848 --> 03:21:07.931  
All of us knew we were trying to grab ahold of each other.

5330
03:21:07.931 --> 03:21:09.416  
TRAVIS: Do it!

5331
03:21:09.416 --> 03:21:10.445  
MATT: What are you doing?

5332
03:21:10.445 --> 03:21:12.495  
MARISHA: I take the tuning fork

5333
03:21:12.495 --> 03:21:14.727
and I slam it against my staff

5334
03:21:14.727 --> 03:21:16.992  
to get a giant ringing noise

5335
03:21:16.992 --> 03:21:18.793  
that just blasts out from all of us

5336
03:21:18.793 --> 03:21:20.892  
and I take and I harness that energy

5337
03:21:20.892 --> 03:21:24.400  
and I blast it out

5338
03:21:24.400 --> 03:21:26.646  
and I think of Whitestone.

5339
03:21:26.646 --> 03:21:27.479  
MATT: Okay.

5340
03:21:27.479 --> 03:21:29.092  
MARISHA: And I think of the Sun Tree.

5341
03:21:29.092 --> 03:21:31.144  
MATT: Okay, everyone's reaching out,

5342
03:21:31.144 --> 03:21:33.048  
hands grasping, grasping,

5343
03:21:33.048 --> 03:21:35.227  
Bob hears the ringing and goes,

5344
03:21:35.227 --> 03:21:36.680  
"Oh, it's happening,"

5345
03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:38.335  
and reaches out towards you, Lieve'tel.

5346
03:21:38.335 --> 03:21:39.168  
Do you take Bob's hand?

5347
03:21:39.168 --> 03:21:40.843  
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

5348
03:21:41.834 --> 03:21:45.446  
LIAM: That rod was in my family for 150 years.

5349
03:21:45.446 --> 03:21:48.157  
MATT: The last thing you say before each of you

5350
03:21:48.157 --> 03:21:52.605  
grasp, feel the druidic energy surge through your arms

5351
03:21:52.605 --> 03:21:55.462  
connecting each of you like little beads of light

5352
03:21:55.462 --> 03:21:59.813  
before all of your forms dissipate

5353
03:21:59.813 --> 03:22:01.298  
and there's nothing but wind and dust left

5354
03:22:01.298 --> 03:22:04.112  
as the chains of Sarenrae wrap once more around the creature

5355
03:22:04.112 --> 03:22:05.169  
and pull it back.

5356
03:22:05.169 --> 03:22:07.183  
The last thing you see is that,

5357
03:22:07.183 --> 03:22:09.485  
being yanked back towards the flame

5358
03:22:09.485 --> 03:22:12.568  
in the distant side of the structure

5359
03:22:13.576 --> 03:22:16.993  
and you are pulled through into darkness.

5360
03:22:18.501 --> 03:22:21.191  
From behind you, you see the lattice, the Divine Gate

5361
03:22:21.191 --> 03:22:25.007  
pass again, the golden net vanish in the distance behind

5362
03:22:25.007 --> 03:22:28.650  
as you're yanked backwards, backwards, backwards.

5363
03:22:28.650 --> 03:22:30.251  
The temperature gets colder and colder and colder

5364
03:22:30.251 --> 03:22:33.501  
and suddenly you are smacked into snow.

5365
03:22:38.956 --> 03:22:41.144  
TALIESIN: Oh no, that happened.

5366
03:22:41.144 --> 03:22:43.474  
There was an extra arm that happened.

5367
03:22:43.474 --> 03:22:44.420  
MATT: You all find yourselves

5368
03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:48.619  
dropped right in the center of the courtyard of Whitestone.

5369
03:22:48.619 --> 03:22:50.610  
MARISHA: I immediately vomit

5370
03:22:50.610 --> 03:22:51.985
with a little bit of blood in there

5371
03:22:51.985 --> 03:22:53.589  
because I still have one hit point.

5372
03:22:53.589 --> 03:22:56.452  
SAM: Oh man.

5373
03:22:56.452 --> 03:23:01.452  
MARISHA: And I just roll over and just lay on the cold snow.

5374
03:23:01.896 --> 03:23:06.288  
ASHLEY: I roll over all the way over to her wherever she is

5375
03:23:06.288 --> 03:23:09.625  
and I put a hand on her and cast Cure Wounds.

5376
03:23:09.625 --> 03:23:10.458  
TALIESIN: Vex?

5377
03:23:10.458 --> 03:23:11.783  
MARISHA: I just roll over to Pike

5378
03:23:11.783 --> 03:23:14.954  
and cuddle her for a minute.
TALIESIN: Grog?

5379
03:23:14.954 --> 03:23:17.243  
ASHLEY: I cast Cure Wounds at 5th-level.

5380
03:23:17.243 --> 03:23:18.561  
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

5381
03:23:18.561 --> 03:23:20.231  
LIAM: Lieve pushes herself to standing

5382
03:23:20.231 --> 03:23:23.669  
and looks at legends

5383
03:23:23.669 --> 03:23:28.669  
and casts Mass Heal, 700 hit points

5384
03:23:28.891 --> 03:23:30.523
divvied up among the crew.

5385
03:23:30.523 --> 03:23:32.206  
TRAVIS: (as Bertrand) If it's all the same--

5386
03:23:32.206 --> 03:23:33.381
SAM: Oh, you lived?

5387
03:23:33.381 --> 03:23:36.906  
TRAVIS: I hope I never see any of you

5388
03:23:36.906 --> 03:23:39.937
ever, ever again.

5389
03:23:39.937 --> 03:23:43.128  
I quit and I'm going into retirement.

5390
03:23:43.128 --> 03:23:44.919  
Goodbye. And I just start walking.

5391
03:23:44.919 --> 03:23:48.882  
Bertrand starts walking out of Whitestone.

5392
03:23:48.882 --> 03:23:50.429  
TALIESIN: What was his name again?

5393
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:51.643  
MARISHA: Bertrand--

5394
03:23:51.643 --> 03:23:54.040  
TALIESIN: Nice, that's right. I'll forget it again.

5395
03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:56.070  
SAM: I'll write a song about him. He deserved it.

5396
03:23:56.070 --> 03:23:57.822  
LAURA: Where's Bob?

5397
03:23:57.822 --> 03:23:58.655
TALIESIN: Bob?

5398
03:23:58.655 --> 03:24:01.878  
MATT: You guys look over and there's a thorn bush

5399
03:24:01.878 --> 03:24:03.361  
and he's currently like,

5400
03:24:03.361 --> 03:24:06.734
"Ow, ow, ow."

5401
03:24:06.734 --> 03:24:08.925  
TALIESIN: Bob.
MATT: "Yes?"

5402
03:24:08.925 --> 03:24:09.900  
TALIESIN: It's not going to get any better.

5403
03:24:09.900 --> 03:24:11.258  
MATT: "Oh.

5404
03:24:12.858 --> 03:24:13.831  
"Ow."

5405
03:24:13.831 --> 03:24:14.664  
TALIESIN: I suppose if you want to.

5406
03:24:14.664 --> 03:24:16.272
LAURA: Scanlan?

5407
03:24:16.272 --> 03:24:18.389
SAM: What?

5408
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:20.142  
LAURA: Have you ever thought about using Modify Memory

5409
03:24:20.142 --> 03:24:22.180  
to make someone happy?

5410
03:24:22.180 --> 03:24:24.941  
SAM: But that's not mischievous at all?

5411
03:24:24.941 --> 03:24:26.774  
I suppose I could try.

5412
03:24:29.187 --> 03:24:30.744  
Sure.

5413
03:24:30.744 --> 03:24:32.877  
Well, wait, what are we doing with him?

5414
03:24:32.877 --> 03:24:33.710  
ASHLEY: Wait.

5415
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:36.230  
LAURA: You could make him whatever--

5416
03:24:36.230 --> 03:24:39.980  
SAM: Weren't we going to try to send him to Limbo?

5417
03:24:40.931 --> 03:24:41.931  
ASHLEY: What if...

5418
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:46.037  
Would Greater Restoration work on his mind?

5419
03:24:46.037 --> 03:24:47.620  
TALIESIN: Don't know.

5420
03:24:47.620 --> 03:24:49.911  
LAURA: Try it.
ASHLEY: I'll try it.

5421
03:24:49.911 --> 03:24:51.338  
MATT: You walk up to him.

5422
03:24:51.338 --> 03:24:54.255  
He's now stopped and he's pushed enough

5423
03:24:54.255 --> 03:24:55.327  
towards the thorn bush

5424
03:24:55.327 --> 03:24:56.470  
and you watch his hand move forward

5425
03:24:56.470 --> 03:24:59.413  
and the thorns bend back and snap

5426
03:24:59.413 --> 03:25:00.405  
without even touching him.

5427
03:25:00.405 --> 03:25:02.073  
You see he's somehow manipulating it

5428
03:25:02.073 --> 03:25:04.406  
with some force of his mind.

5429
03:25:06.489 --> 03:25:07.322  
ASHLEY: Bob.

5430
03:25:07.322 --> 03:25:10.196  
MATT: "Yes, hello?"

5431
03:25:10.196 --> 03:25:11.029  
ASHLEY: Hi.

5432
03:25:11.029 --> 03:25:12.996  
I'm just going to try to help you

5433
03:25:12.996 --> 03:25:15.019  
for just a moment.

5434
03:25:15.019 --> 03:25:15.852  
MATT: "Okay.

5435
03:25:16.977 --> 03:25:20.452  
"I don't recognize this place."

5436
03:25:20.452 --> 03:25:23.054  
ASHLEY: Maybe you will in a little bit.

5437
03:25:23.054 --> 03:25:25.012  
TALIESIN: I'm holding a weird little action.

5438
03:25:25.012 --> 03:25:26.869  
ASHLEY: I place my hand on his shoulder

5439
03:25:26.869 --> 03:25:29.467  
and I'll cast Greater Restoration.

5440
03:25:29.467 --> 03:25:30.725  
MATT: Okay.

5441
03:25:31.768 --> 03:25:34.443  
Lingering aspect of that divine energy

5442
03:25:34.443 --> 03:25:39.443  
that you saw break into the Plane of Pandemonium

5443
03:25:39.751 --> 03:25:44.164  
to hold back that creature that was assaulting you.

5444
03:25:44.164 --> 03:25:47.405  
A flicker of that emerges from your palm

5445
03:25:47.405 --> 03:25:52.138  
and sifts through the body of Bob.

5446
03:25:53.153 --> 03:25:56.350  
You watch his eyes darting around faster

5447
03:25:56.350 --> 03:25:57.524  
as he feels the sensation,

5448
03:25:57.524 --> 03:25:59.357  
"Oh, oh that's strange."

5449
03:26:01.936 --> 03:26:04.103  
His pupils meet yours.

5450
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:13.633  
"My mind has been clouded for so long.

5451
03:26:14.987 --> 03:26:18.287  
"I have forgotten who I am.

5452
03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:23.555  
"Thank you.

5453
03:26:24.490 --> 03:26:26.630  
"What is your name?"

5454
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:29.565  
ASHLEY: My name's Pike.

5455
03:26:29.565 --> 03:26:32.740  
MATT: "Pike. Pike of?"

5456
03:26:35.914 --> 03:26:37.464  
LAURA: Of course, Pike.

5457
03:26:37.464 --> 03:26:39.149
ASHLEY: Pike of--

5458
03:26:39.149 --> 03:26:42.395  
Pike Trickfoot of Vox Machina

5459
03:26:42.395 --> 03:26:44.453  
and I live here.

5460
03:26:45.621 --> 03:26:47.846  
MATT: "And I am--

5461
03:26:49.279 --> 03:26:51.934
I am Shanak.

5462
03:26:51.934 --> 03:26:56.234  
"I am an Anarch from Limbo.

5463
03:26:57.327 --> 03:27:00.523  
"My home is Shra'kt'lor,

5464
03:27:00.523 --> 03:27:04.181  
"and I lost my way on a mission.

5465
03:27:05.587 --> 03:27:08.928  
"For how long, I do not know, but

5466
03:27:12.529 --> 03:27:16.563  
"you've helped me find my way again."

5467
03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:21.393  
ASHLEY: We all did.

5468
03:27:25.615 --> 03:27:28.126  
I'm very, very glad that we were able

5469
03:27:28.126 --> 03:27:30.626  
to take you out of that place.

5470
03:27:32.624 --> 03:27:34.041  
MATT: "Myself as well.

5471
03:27:35.956 --> 03:27:37.698  
"I have aged."

5472
03:27:40.277 --> 03:27:42.610  
ASHLEY: What did you go there for?

5473
03:27:45.553 --> 03:27:50.545  
MATT: "We take pockets of Limbo and build

5474
03:27:54.726 --> 03:27:57.751
"locations for ambassadors,

5475
03:27:57.751 --> 03:28:00.008  
"places of transport.

5476
03:28:02.458 --> 03:28:05.724  
"We were assaulted before we could finish construction.

5477
03:28:07.551 --> 03:28:10.159  
"But I must return.

5478
03:28:11.245 --> 03:28:16.220  
"I can now recall the things that prevented me from leaving.

5479
03:28:19.197 --> 03:28:23.083  
"And I do not need that device.

5480
03:28:23.083 --> 03:28:25.562  
"I didn't need it after all at any point.

5481
03:28:25.562 --> 03:28:29.184  
"I just forgot that I didn't."

5482
03:28:29.184 --> 03:28:31.619  
SAM: Do you need any help getting home?

5483
03:28:31.619 --> 03:28:34.202  
MATT: "No, I believe it's within me.

5484
03:28:35.305 --> 03:28:36.971  
"It's the shame of losing one's mind.

5485
03:28:36.971 --> 03:28:41.954  
"You forget just the things that come naturally to you.

5486
03:28:44.491 --> 03:28:46.533  
"But no longer.

5487
03:28:48.637 --> 03:28:50.378  
"Here,

5488
03:28:54.244 --> 03:28:58.744  
"what do you love in your heart, little Pike Trickfoot?"

5489
03:29:01.737 --> 03:29:06.461  
ASHLEY: Well, I love

5490
03:29:06.461 --> 03:29:08.611
this family,

5491
03:29:09.903 --> 03:29:13.093  
this whole group of people that you see

5492
03:29:13.093 --> 03:29:15.918  
and my best buddy Grog.

5493
03:29:17.193 --> 03:29:19.318  
MATT: "Hmmm."

5494
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:25.183  
As he takes a few steps away from you here in the courtyard,

5495
03:29:25.183 --> 03:29:27.100  
looks around the space,

5496
03:29:28.408 --> 03:29:33.069  
closes his eyes and puts his hands out like this,

5497
03:29:33.069 --> 03:29:34.400  
and you watch as if

5498
03:29:34.400 --> 03:29:37.219  
plucked from the very invisible air,

5499
03:29:37.219 --> 03:29:41.185  
matter seems to emerge, gray and formless,

5500
03:29:41.185 --> 03:29:45.337  
like it's been just sucked out of the ether.

5501
03:29:45.337 --> 03:29:48.842  
As it floats, organic, liquid like,

5502
03:29:48.842 --> 03:29:52.214  
his arms begin to spin and swirl, his eyes closed

5503
03:29:52.214 --> 03:29:57.164  
and you watch as it all slowly drifts down and gathers.

5504
03:29:58.150 --> 03:30:00.630  
He moves his hands like an artist would

5505
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:01.870  
in a feverish painting.

5506
03:30:01.870 --> 03:30:06.862  
Sections of it streak out and harden and harden and harden

5507
03:30:06.862 --> 03:30:11.362  
until after a rapid instant, you blink

5508
03:30:12.666 --> 03:30:14.733  
and there's a set of statues,

5509
03:30:14.733 --> 03:30:18.525  
perfect replicas of each of you.

5510
03:30:23.744 --> 03:30:26.911  
"I hope this is gift enough

5511
03:30:26.911 --> 03:30:29.661  
"for the family that you care for."

5512
03:30:31.597 --> 03:30:33.097
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Thank you.

5513
03:30:35.515 --> 03:30:37.100  
This is beautiful.

5514
03:30:37.100 --> 03:30:40.974  
SSAM: Is there a way mine could just be a few inches taller?

5515
03:30:40.974 --> 03:30:42.974  
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

5516
03:30:46.016 --> 03:30:47.816  
SAM: 24.

5517
03:30:51.201 --> 03:30:53.107  
MATT: Raises just a little bit.

5518
03:30:53.107 --> 03:30:56.367  
LAURA: Did you make that tree?

5519
03:30:56.367 --> 03:30:57.450  
MATT: "Tree.

5520
03:30:59.406 --> 03:31:00.744  
"I did.

5521
03:31:00.744 --> 03:31:03.586  
"It was a means to keep alive in a place

5522
03:31:03.586 --> 03:31:05.956  
"without much to eat.

5523
03:31:05.956 --> 03:31:09.256  
"I think it may have

5524
03:31:09.256 --> 03:31:13.498
possibly contributed to my madness."

5525
03:31:13.498 --> 03:31:16.188  
TALIESIN: I'll analyze it later, before you--

5526
03:31:16.188 --> 03:31:21.080  
MATT: "Anyway, I worry what awaits me

5527
03:31:22.296 --> 03:31:25.976
back in Shraklore."

5528
03:31:25.976 --> 03:31:28.456  
LAURA: Darling, before you go,

5529
03:31:28.456 --> 03:31:31.775  
something else my friend Pike loves

5530
03:31:31.775 --> 03:31:35.581  
is her spell components, which you still have.

5531
03:31:35.581 --> 03:31:37.627  
MATT: "Right.

5532
03:31:37.627 --> 03:31:39.632  
"So sorry."

5533
03:31:39.632 --> 03:31:41.877  
ASHLEY: It's okay, I forgot about that.

5534
03:31:41.877 --> 03:31:43.177  
Thank you, Vex.

5535
03:31:44.635 --> 03:31:46.960  
LIAM: You wouldn't happen to have

5536
03:31:46.960 --> 03:31:50.269
the pinky bone of a dead man, would you?

5537
03:31:51.571 --> 03:31:54.080  
Did you scoop that up by any chance?

5538
03:31:54.080 --> 03:31:56.010  
MATT: "Unfortunately, I think that was residing

5539
03:31:56.010 --> 03:31:59.260  
"somewhere across the chamber," in that chest there.

5540
03:32:00.524 --> 03:32:02.578  
LIAM: Shame.

5541
03:32:02.578 --> 03:32:04.397  
MATT: "But should you ever go back to Limbo,

5542
03:32:04.397 --> 03:32:07.323  
"it should still be where it was left."

5543
03:32:07.323 --> 03:32:10.200  
TRAVIS: You know there's a surefire way to get back there,

5544
03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:12.430  
you just got to find the--

5545
03:32:12.430 --> 03:32:13.563  
by the way,

5546
03:32:13.563 --> 03:32:17.590
what did you guys do with my cards?

5547
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:20.814  
LAURA: Oh, that's a really good question.

5548
03:32:20.814 --> 03:32:22.947  
SAM: Pandemonium, Grog.

5549
03:32:22.947 --> 03:32:24.140  
TRAVIS: Oh, they got left there.

5550
03:32:24.140 --> 03:32:25.481
ASHLEY: We left them there, yeah, Grog.

5551
03:32:25.481 --> 03:32:26.403  
TRAVIS: What a shame.
TALIESIN: We can get you

5552
03:32:26.403 --> 03:32:27.486  
some other cards.

5553
03:32:29.244 --> 03:32:31.842  
ASHLEY: How about we make our own set?

5554
03:32:31.842 --> 03:32:34.322  
We can make drawings on some cards

5555
03:32:34.322 --> 03:32:35.405  
and make your own?

5556
03:32:35.405 --> 03:32:37.066  
We can make a game of it.

5557
03:32:37.066 --> 03:32:38.191  
TRAVIS: Will they be magic?

5558
03:32:38.191 --> 03:32:40.224  
SAM: Well, it will be a deck of many things.

5559
03:32:40.224 --> 03:32:42.903  
What things do you want to be on the deck?

5560
03:32:42.903 --> 03:32:43.746  
TRAVIS: Food.

5561
03:32:43.746 --> 03:32:45.329  
And beer

5562
03:32:45.329 --> 03:32:47.198  
and, like, women

5563
03:32:47.198 --> 03:32:48.521  
and weapons.

5564
03:32:48.521 --> 03:32:49.979  
And, like, blood

5565
03:32:49.979 --> 03:32:51.384  
and, like, peanut butter

5566
03:32:51.384 --> 03:32:52.489  
and, like, lettuce.

5567
03:32:52.489 --> 03:32:53.472  
TALIESIN: I have children.

5568
03:32:53.472 --> 03:32:56.262
I'm all right to leave now. This is good.

5569
03:32:56.262 --> 03:32:57.660  
LAURA: Lettuce would be one of the bad cards.

5570
03:32:57.660 --> 03:32:58.501
MARISHA: You have children?

5571
03:32:58.501 --> 03:33:00.418  
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody wants lettuce.

5572
03:33:01.691 --> 03:33:03.040  
ASHLEY: I say we get you some paints.

5573
03:33:03.040 --> 03:33:04.415  
We'll get you a deck of cards.

5574
03:33:04.415 --> 03:33:07.031  
TALIESIN: Four seconds in the future, all the time.

5575
03:33:07.031 --> 03:33:07.873
So many tracks!

5576
03:33:07.873 --> 03:33:08.706
SAM: Foresight!

5577
03:33:10.956 --> 03:33:12.771  
MATT: Percy's nose is just bleeding in the corner.

5578
03:33:12.771 --> 03:33:15.035  
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, yes, it is.

5579
03:33:15.035 --> 03:33:17.467  
TRAVIS: That would be great.
ASHLEY: We'll make our own set.

5580
03:33:17.467 --> 03:33:19.931  
TRAVIS: Much safer this way.
ASHLEY: Much safer.

5581
03:33:19.931 --> 03:33:22.960  
TRAVIS: I hope you find your way back home

5582
03:33:22.960 --> 03:33:26.994  
and whatever you find brings you some comfort

5583
03:33:26.994 --> 03:33:28.749  
after you being gone for so long.

5584
03:33:28.749 --> 03:33:32.699  
Home is, it's so important.

5585
03:33:33.658 --> 03:33:35.878  
MATT: "That it is.

5586
03:33:35.878 --> 03:33:38.428  
"Thank you, big one.

5587
03:33:40.008 --> 03:33:45.008  
"Well, mayhaps we cross paths again."

5588
03:33:45.581 --> 03:33:47.217  
ASHLEY: Yes.
SAM: Hope so.

5589
03:33:47.217 --> 03:33:48.748  
TALIESIN: You're always welcome.

5590
03:33:48.748 --> 03:33:51.946  
MATT: In the blink of your eye, he's gone.

5591
03:33:51.946 --> 03:33:55.642  
TALIESIN: I wish everyone left that quickly.

5592
03:33:55.642 --> 03:33:58.095  
SAM: That was crazy.

5593
03:33:58.095 --> 03:33:59.680  
I mean crazy.

5594
03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:01.648  
Percy lost an arm.

5595
03:34:01.648 --> 03:34:03.155  
TRAVIS: Got it back.

5596
03:34:03.155 --> 03:34:05.106  
That coat is fucking destroyed.

5597
03:34:05.106 --> 03:34:06.957  
TALIESIN: Do you remember the entire speech now?

5598
03:34:06.957 --> 03:34:07.790  
SAM: No, but--

5599
03:34:07.790 --> 03:34:09.656
TALIESIN: I was so hoping you had it written down.

5600
03:34:09.656 --> 03:34:11.247  
I was really hoping.

5601
03:34:11.247 --> 03:34:14.709  
TRAVIS: I'll turn to Le'veon Bell and say--

5602
03:34:14.709 --> 03:34:17.292  
LIAM: Is that both characters?

5603
03:34:17.292 --> 03:34:18.125  
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5604
03:34:19.198 --> 03:34:21.618  
It's a football player.

5605
03:34:21.618 --> 03:34:25.960  
What lies next for you in your path?

5606
03:34:26.947 --> 03:34:30.102  
LIAM: Well, I will eventually have to return to Vasselheim,

5607
03:34:30.102 --> 03:34:35.102  
but I have heard lovely things of this place.

5608
03:34:35.328 --> 03:34:37.745  
If it is all right--

5609
03:34:37.745 --> 03:34:39.646  
TALIESIN: There's a shrine to the Raven Queen in the west,

5610
03:34:39.646 --> 03:34:41.032  
if you can find it.

5611
03:34:41.032 --> 03:34:42.969  
LAURA: It's quite lovely.

5612
03:34:42.969 --> 03:34:45.119  
TALIESIN: And a room for you, of course.

5613
03:34:45.119 --> 03:34:46.327  
LIAM: If it's all right,

5614
03:34:46.327 --> 03:34:50.285  
I'll stay awhile with Mr. Bell

5615
03:34:51.186 --> 03:34:53.617  
before we return home.

5616
03:34:53.617 --> 03:34:58.617  
MATT: Mr. Bell, of which who's now walking into Whitestone.

5617
03:34:58.662 --> 03:34:59.995  
He just retired.

5618
03:35:01.305 --> 03:35:04.614  
LIAM: I can convince him otherwise.

5619
03:35:05.456 --> 03:35:09.706  
MATT: Lieve, when you were, you know,

5620
03:35:09.706 --> 03:35:13.986
dead for an hour or two,

5621
03:35:13.986 --> 03:35:18.953  
did you see anybody?

5622
03:35:21.757 --> 03:35:24.503  
Do you remember anything?

5623
03:35:24.503 --> 03:35:26.278  
Did you--

5624
03:35:27.819 --> 03:35:30.927
you know, I'm just curious.

5625
03:35:32.629 --> 03:35:34.629  
LIAM: I've lived a long time

5626
03:35:36.534 --> 03:35:37.744  
and I know many things,

5627
03:35:37.744 --> 03:35:40.208  
but I don't see all,

5628
03:35:40.208 --> 03:35:44.166  
nor does she share all.

5629
03:35:47.069 --> 03:35:51.661  
MARISHA: No, I know that much.

5630
03:35:55.031 --> 03:35:56.684  
LIAM: I don't say it out loud,

5631
03:35:56.684 --> 03:35:59.984  
but I cast Commune

5632
03:36:01.006 --> 03:36:04.340  
and I ask three questions.

5633
03:36:08.605 --> 03:36:13.022  
Are their threads relatively safe for the time being?

5634
03:36:15.003 --> 03:36:17.702  
MATT: Out of the cold dark of your subconscious,

5635
03:36:17.702 --> 03:36:22.186  
you feel the warm breathy voice of the Raven Queen

5636
03:36:22.186 --> 03:36:26.946  
just touch the back of your ear and says, "For now.

5637
03:36:26.946 --> 03:36:30.771  
"I watch and they are safe, yes."

5638
03:36:32.255 --> 03:36:34.338  
LIAM: Will this one be happy?

5639
03:36:35.479 --> 03:36:36.896  
MATT: "She already is."

5640
03:36:41.055 --> 03:36:44.055  
LIAM: Will this one eventually be happy?

5641
03:36:45.300 --> 03:36:46.133  
MATT: "In time."

5642
03:36:54.657 --> 03:36:58.427  
LIAM: I'm going to go attempt to retrieve Mr. Bell.

5643
03:36:58.427 --> 03:37:00.824  
I will see you all for dinner, I hope.

5644
03:37:00.824 --> 03:37:02.178  
TALIESIN: Of course.

5645
03:37:02.178 --> 03:37:04.280  
I'll be expecting.

5646
03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:06.097  
LIAM: He has better qualities that one,

5647
03:37:06.097 --> 03:37:08.377  
better than speaking anyway.

5648
03:37:08.377 --> 03:37:09.537  
SAM: Mr. Bell?

5649
03:37:09.537 --> 03:37:10.370  
LIAM: Yes.

5650
03:37:11.620 --> 03:37:13.391  
SAM: Take your word for it.

5651
03:37:13.391 --> 03:37:15.641  
(giggling)

5652
03:37:17.983 --> 03:37:18.816  
TALIESIN: He is fast.

5653
03:37:18.816 --> 03:37:19.899  
LIAM: See you soon.

5654
03:37:25.774 --> 03:37:26.857  
SAM: What a day.

5655
03:37:28.077 --> 03:37:29.918  
LAURA: What a day.

5656
03:37:31.019 --> 03:37:33.792  
TALIESIN: We should risk our lives and nearly die

5657
03:37:33.792 --> 03:37:37.132  
at least once a year, I think. Seems very reasonable.

5658
03:37:37.132 --> 03:37:38.586
LAURA: It's a nice time.

5659
03:37:38.586 --> 03:37:40.057
SAM: Yeah.

5660
03:37:40.057 --> 03:37:43.332  
LAURA: I think I lost my voice in the Pandemonium Plane.

5661
03:37:43.332 --> 03:37:44.621  
It was really windy there.

5662
03:37:44.621 --> 03:37:47.513  
SAM: It was really dry.
ASHLEY: Dust.

5663
03:37:47.513 --> 03:37:49.571
LIAM: Like a concert in the front row.

5664
03:37:49.571 --> 03:37:51.397
TALIESIN: I am down a coat.

5665
03:37:52.904 --> 03:37:54.837  
This is not appropriate.

5666
03:37:54.837 --> 03:37:57.285  
SAM: Oh yes, you need to get some clothes on.

5667
03:37:57.285 --> 03:37:58.233  
Take care of them.

5668
03:37:58.233 --> 03:37:59.551  
LAURA: You need to change for dinner.

5669
03:37:59.551 --> 03:38:01.734  
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get dressed.

5670
03:38:01.734 --> 03:38:03.592  
MATT: As you turn your head back

5671
03:38:03.592 --> 03:38:05.735  
and you see their arms crossed in the corner,

5672
03:38:05.735 --> 03:38:08.902  
long coat, nice, flowing, comfortable,

5673
03:38:10.579 --> 03:38:12.084  
dressed for this temperature

5674
03:38:12.084 --> 03:38:14.729  
you see Cassandra, looking down and say,

5675
03:38:14.729 --> 03:38:19.079  
"Oh brother, I'm going to remember this for quite some time.

5676
03:38:19.079 --> 03:38:21.276  
"No, please, just stand there for a moment.

5677
03:38:21.276 --> 03:38:22.266  
"Let me take it in."

5678
03:38:22.266 --> 03:38:24.495  
TALIESIN: I know where you sleep, my lady.

5679
03:38:24.495 --> 03:38:26.666  
MATT: "And I'll be there sleeping tidily

5680
03:38:26.666 --> 03:38:28.038  
"with this memory forever."

5681
03:38:28.038 --> 03:38:32.056  
TALIESIN: Walk as dignified as I can, right past.

5682
03:38:32.056 --> 03:38:33.643  
MATT: "I have plenty of dresses if you like."

5683
03:38:33.643 --> 03:38:35.976  
TALIESIN: I will see the end of you.

5684
03:38:37.303 --> 03:38:40.537  
MATT: "Well, come, you all look worse for wear.

5685
03:38:40.537 --> 03:38:43.244  
"I heard someone say dinner."

5686
03:38:43.244 --> 03:38:47.494  
<v ->You know, I'm feeling a little nauseous, actually.</v>

5687
03:38:49.178 --> 03:38:52.345  
I don't know if I want dinner tonight.

5688
03:38:54.635 --> 03:38:56.856  
MARISHA: Foresight. Foresight.

5689
03:38:56.856 --> 03:38:58.013  
I called it! Foresight.

5690
03:38:58.013 --> 03:38:59.330  
Yeah!

5691
03:38:59.330 --> 03:39:03.432  
MATT: As you all step in towards Whitestone Castle,

5692
03:39:03.432 --> 03:39:06.194  
we pull back on the beautiful

5693
03:39:06.194 --> 03:39:09.561  
light snowscape of the courtyard of the city.

5694
03:39:09.561 --> 03:39:10.786  
SAM: As we're walking,

5695
03:39:10.786 --> 03:39:12.678  
I'm just going to subtly take Pike's hand

5696
03:39:12.678 --> 03:39:15.816  
and hold it as we walk in.

5697
03:39:15.816 --> 03:39:16.649  
MATT: Okay.

5698
03:39:16.649 --> 03:39:17.914  
ASHLEY: I squeeze it.

5699
03:39:17.914 --> 03:39:19.997  
I squeeze it three times.

5700
03:39:21.293 --> 03:39:25.152  
SAM: One for yes, two for no, three for-- ooh!

5701
03:39:25.152 --> 03:39:28.069  
(laughing)

5702
03:39:30.374 --> 03:39:32.518  
MATT: As you pull away from Whitestone,

5703
03:39:32.518 --> 03:39:35.675  
an evening's rest for our hard fought heroes,

5704
03:39:35.675 --> 03:39:38.867  
having retrieved their long friend

5705
03:39:38.867 --> 03:39:42.008  
and source of perpetual chaos, Grog Strongjaw,

5706
03:39:42.008 --> 03:39:46.720  
from the eternal jaws of Pandemonium's chaos,

5707
03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:48.512  
we'll end the story there.

5708
03:39:48.512 --> 03:39:50.762  
(applause)
(cheering)

5709
03:39:52.193 --> 03:39:54.258  
Search for Bob. Search for Grog.

5710
03:39:54.258 --> 03:39:55.332  
ASHLEY: Heck yeah.

5711
03:39:55.332 --> 03:39:58.010  
MATT: Both done, well done.

5712
03:39:58.010 --> 03:39:59.170  
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

5713
03:39:59.170 --> 03:40:00.766  
Dust titan?!

5714
03:40:00.766 --> 03:40:02.675  
ASHLEY: That was madness.
SAM: Next sequel,

5715
03:40:02.675 --> 03:40:05.092  
Search for Purvan's Finger.

5716
03:40:06.792 --> 03:40:08.302  
TRAVIS: It's just bouncing around--
MATT: That was a fun one.

5717
03:40:08.302 --> 03:40:09.466  
This form was fun.

5718
03:40:09.466 --> 03:40:11.849  
I had an AC of 26.

5719
03:40:11.849 --> 03:40:14.447  
LAURA: Next game, we can have our wedding.

5720
03:40:14.447 --> 03:40:15.530  
LIAM: Oh my god.

5721
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:16.929  
Your freaking voice.

5722
03:40:16.929 --> 03:40:19.324  
LAURA: Bro, what the fuck?

5723
03:40:19.324 --> 03:40:21.538  
ASHLEY: How did you, just in the game?

5724
03:40:21.538 --> 03:40:22.839  
LAURA: I know.

5725
03:40:22.839 --> 03:40:24.053  
I got to stop talking.

5726
03:40:24.053 --> 03:40:25.723  
MATT: Yeah, keep that down, keep that down.

5727
03:40:25.723 --> 03:40:27.029  
LAURA: I got sessions, y'all.

5728
03:40:27.029 --> 03:40:30.112  
MARISHA: We were going to do the summer vacation

5729
03:40:30.112 --> 03:40:32.262
one-shot, too, right?

5730
03:40:32.262 --> 03:40:33.705  
Destination wedding.

5731
03:40:33.705 --> 03:40:36.205  
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they are those assholes,

5732
03:40:36.205 --> 03:40:37.364  
I'm so in.

5733
03:40:37.364 --> 03:40:39.630  
ASHLEY: Yes, yes, yes.

5734
03:40:41.190 --> 03:40:42.023  
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

5735
03:40:42.023 --> 03:40:46.440  
MATT: Oh, we're totally going to do a destination wedding

5736
03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:51.179  
adventure, where what could possibly go wrong?

5737
03:40:51.179 --> 03:40:52.754  
TALIESIN: You're lucky we're not making you

5738
03:40:52.754 --> 03:40:56.076
Plane Shift to get there, motherfuckers!

5739
03:40:56.076 --> 03:40:56.978
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

5740
03:40:56.978 --> 03:40:58.823  
MATT: I've already got some ideas percolating now.

5741
03:40:58.823 --> 03:41:02.240  
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh, Laura, that's so good. That's so good.

5742
03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:04.213  
MATT: Well, you need to get some rest.

5743
03:41:04.213 --> 03:41:08.412  
We all do. I have to be up in five hours.

5744
03:41:08.412 --> 03:41:09.817  
Guys, thank you for watching,

5745
03:41:09.817 --> 03:41:11.249  
thank you for making this happen.

5746
03:41:11.249 --> 03:41:13.901  
Your fantastic support and having this

5747
03:41:13.901 --> 03:41:17.454  
and now more Kickstarter based one-shots

5748
03:41:17.454 --> 03:41:18.412  
coming down the way,

5749
03:41:18.412 --> 03:41:20.151  
just know that we love you very much

5750
03:41:20.151 --> 03:41:22.247  
and is it Thursday yet?

5751
03:41:22.247 --> 03:41:23.080  
Good night.

5752
03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:25.997  
(cheering)
